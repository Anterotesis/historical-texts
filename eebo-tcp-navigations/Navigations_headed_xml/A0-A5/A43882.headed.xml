<HEAD>THE BOOKSELLER TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER so many disjointed Relations of Truth, and uncertain Reports hud∣led and confus'd one among another, we do here present the Reader with a conti∣nued Diary of the whole Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> from the very first March of the Army that lay be∣fore it, till the end of the Siege, which terminated in the Winning of the Town. The Gentleman that wrote it in <HI>French</HI> was, with∣out question, an Eye-witness of most of those bloody Transactions, as being an Imperialist, and upon the Theatre himself. Nor is it rea∣sonable to mistrust the Credit of a Person, whose Zeal for the Common Cause makes him so diligent as not to omit the least Particular that may contribute to the Honour of so many
<PB REF="3"/>Renowned Commanders, without detracting in the least from the Gallantry of the Defendants. So that the Passages of every Day, thus clos'd and join'd together, yields a full Prospect of the Industry, Vigilancy, Courage, Resolution, Experience and Conduct of Generals exact in Martial Affairs; and the Indefatigable Con∣stancy and Valour of Laborious and well-Disci∣plin'd Soldiers. A Piece, which when the Curious in History have read, they will find the Story of the most Famous Siege in the World; the Assailants equalling, if not surpassing <HI>Ti∣tus</HI> surrounding <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and <HI>Abdi Basha</HI> no less bravely obstinate in defending his Trust, than <HI>Villerius</HI> upon the Walls of <HI>Rhodes.</HI> Of which I shall say no more in the Epistle, since the Book is so near at hand.</P>

<HEAD>AN Historical Description OF THE CONQUEST Of the CITY of BUDA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Divisions and Mis-understandings that have reign'd among the Christian Princes, gave the Mahometans an opportunity to surprise some by Policy and Stratagem, others by the force of their triumphing Arms, and to constrain some, that were not in a condition to stop the Torrent of their formidable Armies, to put themselves under their Protection, and acknowledge, by the payment of an Annual Tribute, the power of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; which in less than four Centuries has spread it self to such a vast Extent, and become so terrible to all the Earth, that their Chief Sultans would suffer no Superi∣ours, nor acknowledge any Equals. True it is, the Po∣tent <HI>Tamerlan</HI> King of the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Parthians,</HI> had the
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>good fortune to tame the Pride and haughty Arrogance of <HI>Bajazet:</HI> But his death, which happen'd in the flower of his Age, reviv'd the dejected courage of the <HI>Turks</HI> in such a manner, that they not only regain'd the King∣doms and Countries which that victorious Prince had wrested out of their hands, but in process of time forc'd the <HI>Parthians</HI> also and the <HI>Tartars</HI> to do them Homage, to pay 'em Tribute, and submit to such Laws as the <HI>Otto∣man</HI> Emperours thought fit to impose upon 'em.</P>
<P>These Barbarians have often attempted to bring <HI>Ger∣many</HI> under their subjection; to which purpose they have several times, like an Inundation, with all the Forces of the East over-run <HI>Hungary, Austria,</HI> and the adjacent Countries; and had accomplished their designs, had not God in meer pity and compassion, heard the Prayers of all Christendom, and twice miraculously delivered the City of <HI>Vienna</HI> from the fury of the Infidels: First, in the year 1529. when <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent with an Army of 300000 fighting Men had reduc'd it to the last extre∣mity, by means of the bloody Assaults with which he harrass'd the Defendants without ceasing; yet was con∣strain'd to raise his Siege upon the approach of the Empe∣ror <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth. The second time, in the year 1683. when a numerous <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, consisting of above 200000. Men, under the Command of the Grand Visier <HI>Cara Mustapha,</HI> attack'd that important Bulwark of <HI>Germany,</HI> with so much fury, during a Siege of three Months, carried on with the greatest vigor and obstina∣cy that had been known for many Ages past; so that the place was driven to its last shifts, and had certainly been forc'd to undergo the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Yoke, had not the God of Battels rais'd the <HI>Polonians, Bavarians, Saxons,</HI> and other Subjects of the Empire, to follow their several Princes, to the Succour of the capital City of <HI>Au∣stria;</HI> where they all equally shar'd the honour of fight∣ing those Infidels, and putting them to a shameful flight,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>with the loss of all their Baggage, Riches, Artillery, and a prodigious quantity of warlike Ammunition and Pro∣visions; and above fifty thousand of their number slain.</P>
<P>Since which time God approving the justice of our thrice Illustrious and Invincible Emperour's Cause, has in such a manner blest his victorious Armies, under the Conduct of the Brave and Generous Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the most Serene Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> through the great Victories they have gain'd, and the glorious Con∣quests they have made, during the whole course of four <HI>Campagnes</HI> together, that they have struck a Terror over all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire: So that the people not knowing where the fault lay, have miserably put to death the principal Ministers of the Port, and the best Officers of their Armies, imputing to them the cause of God's wrath, as now intending to destroy their Empire, and exterminate the Law of their Prophet, for engaging them in an unjust War, contrary to the opinion of their <HI>Mufti,</HI> who is the Oracle of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and to whom those Infidels give as much credit, as the Christians do to the Traditions and Writings of the true Prophets, and Doctors of the Church. This <HI>Mufti,</HI> who is the Inter∣preter, and Dispenser, and consequently the Head of the Mahometan Law, was the only person in the <HI>Divan,</HI> who endeavour'd to disswade the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> from entring into a War with the Emperor, in favour of <HI>Tecke∣ly,</HI> foretelling him the curses that would fall upon his head, the hazard he would run of losing his Empire, and seeing it shar'd among the Christian Princes; saying withal, That God would never endure, that the <HI>Mussel∣men,</HI> who had always been so punctual in the observa∣tion of their Treaties, should violate a League two years before its expiration, and enter into an unjust War, which would infallibly draw upon their heads the anger of the Almighty. And indeed he miss'd but little of moving the credulous People, and rousing up in their
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>minds an aversion to a War so fatal and ruinous to their Repose.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to remedy so many disorders, and prevent the mischiefs threatned him from his own Sub∣jects, used all the means imaginable to put an end to this Bloody War; to which end he offer'd to make a Peace with the Emperour upon Articles favourable to Christendom; and the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> having rejected his Propositions, he addressed himself to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Republic of <HI>Venice,</HI> to bring 'em to a particular accommodation, and to break that Sacred League which our Holy Father <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. so politick∣ly contriv'd, and carry'd on at the expence of the Treasures of the Church, for the good of the Cause of Jesus Christ, and the Propagation of the True Faith.</P>
<P>In the mean time the great War-like preparations which the Emperour made in his Hereditary Countries, and other parts of <HI>Germany</HI> were carry'd on so vigo∣rously, that all things were ready by the time appointed, to thunder in upon the Turkish Garrisons. The Artil∣lery, the vast number of Bombs, Granado's, Shells, and Fire-works, the inventions of a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Monk, and the Sieur <HI>Gonzales,</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ingineer, were so dreadful, that well there could not any doubt be made of the happy issue of one of the most glorious and daring En∣terprises that had been undertaken in a long time: And though the Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> were in vain attempted in the year 1684. at what time it cost us the blood of 10000. Christians, the disappointment of one Cam∣pagne, and the expence of so much Treasure; yet was not the Imperial Court discourag'd from a second at∣tempt, well knowing that upon the Conquest of that important Capital, depended all the rest of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>True it is, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was not more succes∣ful in the first Siege, than those other Generals which
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>had preceded him in that Enterprise; however he fail'd not to acquire great honour, and made it apparent, that he might be compar'd with the most renowned Captains, which past Ages have admir'd, by that noble re∣treat which he made in the face of a numerous Garri∣son, and an Army of the Enemies, little inferiour to his own; who durst not make the least attempt upon his Rear, for fear of having no better success than at the time of the Siege, during which the Duke had three times beaten the Serasquier's Army; and had it not been that the Winter was already come, which caus'd a scarcity of Forrage, and other necessaries for the sub∣sistence of the Armies, and some little mis-understandings among the Generals, perhaps there might have been no need of a second Siege.</P>
<P>In the Council of War that was held the last year in presence of the Emperor, to consult what was to be done the next Summer, there were some who presently pro∣pounded the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> and to keep the Fortress of <HI>Newhausel</HI> blockt up, that so it might be compelled to yield of it self; which was rejected by others, who were of opinion, That Thorn was first to be pulled out of the foot, and that the Expedition of <HI>Buda</HI> was to be reserv'd for the present year, as was done. In the mean time there were several Councils of War, wherein the Sentiments of the Generals were very much divided; the most part affirming, That it was first requisite to be Masters of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> to prevent the Turks from ma∣king use of it as a place of Retreat, and sheltering their Army under the Cannon of that Fortress, as the Seras∣quier had done at the last Siege, to the great vexation of our Forces. Others were for marching directly to the Bridge of <HI>Esseck,</HI> taking that City, and then lea∣ving a part of the Army for the preservation of that important Passage; to wast all the Enemies Country, and so to sit down before <HI>Buda.</HI> Others were for the
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>Recovery of <HI>Agria,</HI> and the Fortress of <HI>Mongats,</HI> there∣by to exterminate the Remainder of that Arch-Rebel <HI>Teckely</HI>'s adherents; of which, the Reduction of those two places would clear all the <HI>Ʋpper Hungary.</HI> Some propos'd to act with two Armies apart: That the Ele∣ctor of <HI>Bavaria</HI> should march into the <HI>Ʋpper Hungary,</HI> and draw one part of the Enemies Forces that way, while the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> Besieg'd <HI>Alba Regalis;</HI> and that the <HI>Croatian</HI> Army under General <HI>Schultz</HI> should march toward the Bridge of <HI>Esseck.</HI> There were very few that concluded positively for the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> which was nevertheless the Enterprize that the Emperor and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had resolv'd to put in Execu∣tion whatever it cost 'em, that they might have the rest of <HI>Hungary</HI> at a cheaper rate, keep a door open to <HI>Bel∣grade,</HI> and Winter fifty or sixty thousand <HI>Germans,</HI> in the Kingdom, where the year before they could not Winter above twenty thousand.</P>
<P>This Design thus concluded upon, was kept very se∣cret, even from the Generals themselves, to whom the Emperour upon their dismission declar'd, that he would send his Resolution what he would have done to the general Rendezvous, which was appointed to be in the Plains of <HI>Barkan,</HI> upon the thirtieth of <HI>May.</HI> But be∣cause the Auxiliary Forces of <HI>Bavaria, Brandenburgh, Saxony,</HI> and the <HI>Circles,</HI> could not be there so soon, they were delay'd for some days. In the mean time the For∣ces march'd from all parts to the place assign'd, as well by Water as Land; so that it was a lovely sight to see the <HI>Danube</HI> cover'd with such an infinite number of Barks and Barges laden with Soldiers, great Guns, Ammuni∣tion, and Provisions, Bullets, Bombs, Granado's, Carcas∣ses, Shovels, Pick-Axes, and other Instruments fit for the Siege of a Town.</P>
<P>Upon the 20th. of <HI>May</HI> the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Newstadt,</HI> to which place the whole Court was
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>come from <HI>Vienna</HI> some days before. There his E∣lectoral Highness, together with the Arch-Dutchess his La∣dy were received by their Imperial Highnesses, with all the Marks of a tender Affection, beseeming the near Relati∣on between Personages of that illustrious Quality, the Cannon of the Garrison being three times discharged up∣on their Entrance.</P>
<P>Upon the 23d. being Ascension-Day, the Elector went to visit the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was come to <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> though somewhat indisposed, and returned the same E∣vening to <HI>Newstadt:</HI> Where his Electoral Highness ha∣ving had several Conferences about the opening of the <HI>Campaign,</HI> and taken leave of their Imperial Majesties, and the Electress his Wife, he departed the second of <HI>June,</HI> with the Acclamations of the whole Court, and People, and the Prayers and good Wishes of all, That God would be pleased to preserve the Life of that young Prince, who was going so generously to expose his own, and the Lives of his Subjects in such a Holy War, against the sworn Enemy of Christendom.</P>
<P>After that his said Electoral Highness arriving at <HI>Comor∣rha,</HI> was there received by the Commanders, and Magi∣strates of the City, with Peals of Cannon, and three Vol∣leys of small Shot, ranged in double Files, and so con∣ducted to the Lodging prepared for him. The next day the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who had put himself at the Head of the Imperial Army, near <HI>Barkan,</HI> came to give a vi∣sit to his Electoral Highness, and view the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Ar∣my, which was to that purpose drawn up in Battle-Array in the Fields, near <HI>Comorrha,</HI> where Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Ba∣den</HI> commanded next under his Electoral Highness, in the quality of General of the Cavalry, Count <HI>Serini</HI> in quality of General of Artillery. The Marquess <HI>de la Vergne,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Fontaign,</HI> acted there as Lieutenant-General Marshals of the Camp; the Count <HI>d'Aspremont,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugenius</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> served as Generals of <HI>Battalia's.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>The Baron of <HI>Beck,</HI> who was also nominated to serve under his Electoral Highness, lying sick at <HI>Newhausel</HI> of a dangerous Feaver, was dispenc'd with; but his Regi∣ment of Infantry, which was in the number of those which the Emperour had made choice of to re-inforce the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> fail'd not to be there under the Command of the Lieutenant Colonel.</P>
<P>The 10th of <HI>June</HI> Count <HI>Straatman,</HI> great Chancellour to the Emperour, arriv'd at the general Rendezvous near <HI>Barkan,</HI> to compose certain differences that were risen a∣mong the Generals upon certain Punctilio's of Command, and allotment ordain'd of who and who to serve in the separate Armies of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> This Minister of State, who is one of the most dextrous Persons, and profoundest Politicians of his Age, caus'd a Council of War to be call'd, where he so well manag'd the dispositions of the Generals, that he gave them all the satisfaction imaginable: Which done, he shew'd them the Imperial Commission, containing the Emperour's orders to begin the Campagne with the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> exhorting them withal to behave themselves ac∣cording to their Qualities in an Enterprize of such great importance, upon which depended not only the preser∣vation of his Conquests, the establishment of his Crown Imperial, and the welfare of Christendom, but also the Ruin of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which after the loss of so considerable a place could not prevent the other Cities of <HI>Hungary</HI> from returning under the Obedience of their Lawful Sovereign, nor stop the progress of the Christian Arms. So that though the Generals expected positive Or∣ders to besiege <HI>Agria,</HI> or <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> it is not to be ex∣press'd how much overjoy'd they were when they heard that the Emperour was resolv'd they should sit down be∣fore <HI>Buda.</HI> And this News being spread among the Of∣ficers and Soldiers of both Armies, they testify'd their particular satisfaction, and the eager desire which they
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>had to hasten to the place where they should have such noble opportunities to give signal proofs of their Valour, and revenge the death of their Comrades, which had laid their bones in the Trenches of the former Siege. The Volunteers, which were already numbred to be above six thousand that resorted to this Stage of War, from <HI>Germany, Spain, Italy, France, England,</HI> the Low-Coun∣tries, and all part of <HI>Europe,</HI> of all Qualities and Con∣ditions, to win honour under the Imperial Ensigns, mani∣fested the greatest heat and zeal imaginable to signalize their Courage in so glorious an Enterprize.</P>
<P>The Auxiliaries of <HI>Saxony</HI> commanded by the Prince of <HI>Saxen-Hall,</HI> and Major-General, the Count <HI>de Trautmans∣dorf,</HI> who had taken their march through <HI>Moravia,</HI> be∣ing by this time also arriv'd at the Rendezvous, the Generals resolv'd to decamp, without staying any longer for the Forces of the Circles, or those of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> who having chosen the way of <HI>Silesia,</HI> and the narrow streights of <HI>Jabluncka,</HI> march'd but slowly, and could not arrive so soon.</P>
<P>Thereupon the Armies dislodg'd the 12th of <HI>June,</HI> be∣ing <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Eve, by break of day: The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> taking the Road that led to the Bridge of <HI>Gran,</HI> which his Army pass'd the 13th. The Troops of <HI>Saxony</HI> keeping the Van. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> held his march on this side the <HI>Danaw,</HI> that he might make himself Ma∣ster of the City of <HI>Pest,</HI> before he sate down before <HI>Buda.</HI> While the two Armies march'd thus on both sides the <HI>Danaw,</HI> the Count of <HI>Rabata,</HI> Commissary-General, caus'd a prodigious number of Gabions and Bavins to be em∣bark'd, for making of which the Soldiers were still em∣ploy'd, as they came to their Rendezvous, to keep 'em from idleness, which were all sent with the great Guns, Ammunition, Provision, Hay, and other necessary Provi∣sions for the subsistence of the Armies.</P>
<P>The 14th. The Body of the main Army advanc'd so far as till they came under <HI>Vicegrad,</HI> but the smaller Artillery,
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>and the Reer-guard were constrain'd to stay behind by reason of the narrow ways through which they were to pass. The <HI>Bavarian</HI> Army quarter'd that night near <HI>Vaccia,</HI> on the other side of the <HI>Danaw.</HI></P>
<P>The 15th. The Imperial Cavalry continu'd their march for an hour beyond <HI>Vicegrad,</HI> followed by the Infantry, and Artillery. And then it was that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sent out a commanded Party to discover the Enemy, who met with a small Party of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that presently betook themselves to flight; but ours had the good for∣tune to overtake 'em, and after they had kill'd some, to make five Prisoners, whom they brought to our Camp. Where being examin'd, they unanimously declar'd, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Agria</HI> and <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> fearing a Siege, had secur'd the best of their Goods in the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> which together with both the other places were provi∣ded both with Men, and all things necessary to sustain a long Siege, till Relief came.</P>
<P>The 16th. They came within an hours march of <HI>Buda,</HI> none of the Troops of the Garrison appearing all this while to observe our countenances.</P>
<P>The 17th. The Cavalry made a halt to rest themselves, and to give the Infantry and the Artillery time to come up. At what time the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> commanded three thousand Men to make some thousands of Gabions and Bavins, and began to lay a Bridge of Boats over the Ri∣ver, to the Island of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> thereby to joyn together both sides of the <HI>Danaw.</HI></P>
<P>The 18th. The Baron of <HI>Diependael,</HI> General of Batta∣lia, invested the City of <HI>Buda</HI> with one part of the Ca∣valry, while the Infantry came up and took their Posts about half a League from the place; and then they be∣gan the Lines of Circumvallation. At what time a great Party of the Garrison, both Horse and Foot, shew'd themselves without <HI>Vienna</HI> Gate. But they retreated in∣to the City, upon the approach of a detachment of the Imperial Cavalry, which was commanded to charge 'em.
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>But then the besieged bestowed upon us eight Peals of their Cannon, though without doing any more hurt than only killing one single Pioneer, by reason they shot at too great a distance.</P>
<P>The 19th. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> caus'd the Army to advance as far as the hot Baths, of which he made him∣self Master, without any opposition, (the <HI>Turks</HI> having a∣bandon'd that Post the day before) and took up his Head Quarters about a quarter of a League from the place. The same day the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> made him∣self Master of the City of <HI>Pest,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> had for∣saken, after they had carry'd off their Cannon, Ammuni∣tion and Provisions into <HI>Buda,</HI> and broken down part of the Bridge of Communication between the one place and the other. About the same time our <HI>Croats</HI> scouting up and down met a Turkish <HI>Chaous</HI> with a Convoy of forty Spahi's, who carry'd Letters from the Port to the Grand Visier of <HI>Buda:</HI> Him they brought Prisoner to the Camp, where his Letters were read, containing only strict Or∣ders to the Visier, to be watchful over the Security of the Places that depended upon his Government, and to assure him of speedy and powerful succour, in case of an At∣tack.</P>
<P>The 20th. The Bridg over the <HI>Danaw</HI> was finished. Some of the Enemies Cavalry also the same Day sallied out of the Town, with a design to cut off our <HI>Advancd Guards;</HI> but his Highness the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having timely notice thereof, sent 4 Squadrons of Horse to repel 'em; with whom joined also several Volunteers; upon whose approach the Enemy retreated, not daring to en∣gage. The same Day the Artillery arrived in the Camp, and two Batteries were begun to be raised against the low∣er Town, which was the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Attack, the Count of <HI>Starenbergh</HI> doing the duty of the Day, as Camp-Marshal-General. That Evening the Trenches were open∣ed; and a <HI>Janisary</HI> surren dring himself to our Camp, report∣ed as the other Prisoners had done before, that there
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>were not above eight Thousand Souldiers in the Garri∣son; for that the Vizier had sent some few days before a Reinforcement of two Thousand Men to <HI>Agria,</HI> and an equal number to <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> never dreamt that the Imperialists had determined a second Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> which had proved so fatal to 'em but two Years ago. This Deserter likewise said, that the Place was abundantly provided with Victuals, and Warlike Ammunition, to maintain a long Siege. Moreover, that the Vizier <HI>Abdi Bassa</HI> was no great Soldier, fitter to make a Merchant of, than a Governour, and conse∣quently despised by the Soldiers. That he had assembled in the public Piazza of the City, all the Captains and Soldiers, and had there with a studied Harangue, ex∣horted 'em to behave themselves according to their Du∣ties, and gloriously to maintain the honour of the <HI>Tur∣bant;</HI> adding withal, that he had Orders from the Grand Signior, to defend the Place to the last dorp of his Blood; which he was resolved to do, hoping that they would do the like in Expectation of that Relief, which the Grand Signior would infallibly send them. To whom the Jani∣saries, and Spahi's replied, that they were ready to sacri∣fice their Lives in the Service of his Highness and defence of their Law, upon Condition nevertheless, that the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> would pay them down upon the Nail, ten Crowns a Head; that he would set at Liberty the Offi∣cers and Souldiers detained in the Prisons, whatever their Crimes might be; and that the Vizier would not hold out to the last Extremity, lest the same Misfortune should befal them, as befel the Garrison of <HI>New-hausel:</HI> all which Conditions the Vizier promised exactly to per∣form.</P>
<P>The 21st. The Trenches were relieved, upon the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Attack, by Monsieur <HI>Fonck,</HI> Lieutenant Co∣lonel of the Regiment of <HI>Souches.</HI> And the same day, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> having left a sufficient strength in <HI>Pest,</HI> and passed the Bridge of Boats, to St. <HI>Andrew's</HI> I∣sland,
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>arrived with his Army, before the Place, and took his Post on the same part of the Town, where he had commanded in the former Siege, that is to say, next to the Castle and the High Town, to form a second Attack; the third being reserved for the <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> which were expected in a few Days, and were to be re-inforced with the Troops of <HI>Suabia</HI> and <HI>Franconia.</HI> That Night the Enemy fired furiously upon our Men, that wrought hard in making their Approaches, and raising their Bat∣teries, of whom there were about seven or eight Killed, and as many Wounded.</P>
<P>The 22d. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sent all the Imperial and <HI>Bavarian</HI> Cavalry, under the Command of General <HI>Palsi, Gondola,</HI> and others, to Quarter about <HI>Alba Rega∣lis,</HI> to consume the Forrage in those Places, and keep that Garrison in continual Alarm, reserving in his Camp no more than a Thousand <HI>Bavarian,</HI> and three Thousand Im∣perial Horse, to secure the Pioneers. That Night we brought to Perfection a Battery against the low Town, upon which were planted twelve Pieces of Cannon, which played all that Day, without ceasing: We had five Men Killed, and some Wounded.</P>
<P>The 23d. By Break of day, we continued Firing with such good Success, that there was a Breach made in the Wall of the Low Town, about twenty Paces broad. All this while the <HI>Bavarians</HI> wrought hard in making their Approaches, of whom there were some also Killed and Wounded.</P>
<P>The 24th. The Breach being enlarged, they gave an Assault toward Evening, and made themselves Masters of the Wall, without much resistance, for that they who were to have defended it, were retired into the High Town, after they had fired only once. In this on∣set we had a Captain of Foot, a Lieutenant of Granadeers, four Soldiers, and six Volunteers Killed, and seven or eight Wounded. And from this time forward, they began to attack the City, according to the due forms of Art;
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>and a resolution was taken, that the Trenches should e∣very day be relieved by a Serjeant General of Battalia, as well upon the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Side, as that of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s: and so upon the 25th. The Count of <HI>Souches,</HI> Lieutenant Camp-Marshal General, and <HI>Diepen∣dael,</HI> General of Battalia, relieved the Trenches: at what time, little else was done, but only they secured their Lodg∣ing upon the Wall of the Low Town, and re-open'd a Gate, which the <HI>Turks</HI> had closed up to the Right hand, at a good distance from the Breach, where they had taken their Post; and to the end the Pioneers might work more safely, the Count <HI>de Souches</HI> caused some adjoining Houses to be fi∣red where some <HI>Fuseleer Turks</HI> were burnt. The same day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> finished a small Battery upon St. <HI>Gerards Mount,</HI> which the Enemy had abandoned, from whence they shot some small Bombs into the High Town, to try the Effect. They also finished another great Battery to beat down the great Roundel that joins the Castle to the High Town. The same day Count <HI>Budiani</HI> presented to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> some Colours, which he had won from a Party of <HI>Turkish</HI> Cavalry, which convoyed about fourteen or fif∣teen Barks, laden with Women and Children, belonging to the Officers of <HI>Buda,</HI> who were endeavouring to make their Escape, with all the wealth of the City, to <HI>Belgrade;</HI> and whom his <HI>Hussars,</HI> and <HI>Heydukes,</HI> reinforced with a Par∣ty of Imperial Dragoons, had surprized and routed near St. <HI>Margarets</HI> Island, got a rich Booty, and taken Ninety two Women and Children, and among the rest, the Vi∣zier of <HI>Buda</HI>'s Wife.</P>
<P>The 26th. They wrought upon several traverse Lines, and to finish the Approaches, to secure our Lodgments in the Low Town, which were furnished with two Thou∣sand Soldiers, and a good number of Pioneers, who met with great difficulty to advance their Works, the Ground being very rugged, and Stony. The same day the Grand Master of the <HI>Teutonic</HI> Order, perceiving that our Workmen in the Low Town might be easily assailed and
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>beaten by the <HI>Turks,</HI> sent to Count <HI>Starenbergh</HI> Camp-Mar∣shal General for some Infantry, who thereupon sent him six Battalions, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Starenbergh, Newbourg, Mansfield, Souches, Diependael,</HI> and <HI>Tungen,</HI> who were posted along the Wall, to secure the Workmen. The same day also two Deserters, who pretended themselves to be <HI>Hungari∣ans,</HI> surrendred themselves, and confirmed what had been said before, that the Garrison consisted of no more than eight Thousand fighting Men, and that by the order of the <HI>Visier Bassa,</HI> they had begun to take away the Roofs of the Houses, and to unpave the Streets, on purpose to prevent the Effects of the Bombs. Toward Evening, between six and seven a Clock, the <HI>Turks</HI> sallied forth, making hideous outcries, on purpose to scare those that were posted near the Roundel, toward the Water-side; but they were so well received, that they retired in great Con∣fusion. For Camp-Marshal General <HI>Starenbergh</HI> came timely in with two Battalions of those Men that had been posted the day before, behind the Wall; which had he not done, the Enemy without doubt had made a great Slaughter of our Pioneers. The Enemy was pursued about two Hun∣dred Paces from the Trenches, and our Soldiers brought off several of the Heads of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which they present∣ed to his Highenss the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who caused a Ducket in Gold to be given to each Soldier, for every Head. Captain <HI>Burger</HI> of <HI>Starenbergh's</HI> Regiment was there wounded, with ten or twelve Soldiers, and as many slain outright.</P>
<P>The same day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> finished two Batteries for Bombs, on each side their Grand Battery. They also carryed on their Trenches above a Hundred Paces, they also made three cross Lines, and a Place for drawing up the Soldiers for the Guard of their Battery. The <HI>Turks</HI> also fired very furiously upon us with their great Guns, but did us no more Mischief, than only to kill us two Men.</P>
<P>The 27th. Finished the Works which they had begun
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>in the Night; they made new Traverses; some Musque∣teers were put into the Mosque of the Low Town; a Post was taken upon the Right hand, near the Gate which makes the Angle of the High Town; they enlarged and deepened their Lines, to render 'em capable of holding more Men; and almost finished the Grand Battery, with∣out any Loss, saving one Man Killed, and some Wound∣ed. That Morning the Enemy shewed themselves in the same Part as the day before, ranged as if they had de∣signed some Encounter, but perceiving we were ready to receive them, they retired within the Circuit of their Walls, without enterprizing any thing. About eleven a Clock at Noon, they sallied out Horse and Foot to dislodge our Men that were posted on the Right hand; but having discharged one single Volley, and perceiving the Count of <HI>Hoffkirken, Dunewald</HI>'s Lieutenant Collonel, hastning to the relief of ours, with the Horse-guard, they regain'd the Ci∣ty, leaving twenty of their Men dead upon the Spot, be∣sides the Wounded, which they carried along with them. Of ours, there were but two killed, and five or fix wound∣ed. The same day came another Deserter, who reported that the Governour was very much perplexed, foreseeing the inevitable loss of the City, which the Grand Signior had committed to his Charge; as also for that in his Sal∣leys, he lost the best and choicest of his Men, without any hopes of ruining our Works; but that nothing griev'd him so much to the Heart, as the taking of his own, and the Wives of the principal Officers of the Garrison, by the <HI>Heydukes, Hussars,</HI> and Dragoons, when they thought they had been in a place of safety. The same day also finished a Battery on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, levelled against the Castle and the Rondel next the City.</P>
<P>They 29th. They drew a Line of Communication four Hundred Paces in length from the Post of the Right hand Angle, to the middle Gate, and another Line were made to go to the middle Battery, upon which was Planted twelve Pieces of Cannon. They also wrought to
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>raise a small Battery near the great one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, whereon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> four Mortar pieces, which were brought thither in the Evening with some Waggons full of Bombs. The same time the Besieged began to cast Bombs and Stones upon ours; so that a Captain and 16 Soldi∣ers were wounded that night, and some slain. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> then foreseeing that there might be a scarcity of Horse-meat in the Camp, sent the greatest part of the Baggage Horses into the Meadows that were assign'd them between <HI>Newhausel</HI> and <HI>Gran.</HI> And then it was that General <HI>Dunewald,</HI> who commanded the Cavalrie, encamped near <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> gave Advice to his High∣ness, That the Turks having quitted the Castle of <HI>Bathyan</HI> upon the River <HI>Zarwis,</HI> he had placed a Garrison therein, and that he had made an Attempt upon <HI>Palotta,</HI> a very strong Fort, near <HI>Alba Regalis.</HI></P>
<P>The 29. we continued to finish our Works, and his serene Highness increased the number of Pioneers to six hundred. The Enemy made no Sallies during these two Days, but fir'd more suriously than usually to ruine our great Battery. About five <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Clock in the Evening they made a most furious Attack upon the Bavarian Attack with 2000 Horse and Foot, with so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uccess, that they put ours into a Confusion; and the Janisaries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rowing themselves into the Approaches, were very busie in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ining all before 'em; when the Count of <HI>Hoffkirken,</HI> who there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Wonders, flew to the Relief of the Engaged with the Horse∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uard of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI>'s Quarter, and the <HI>Bavarian</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enerals with the Reserve, so that the Combat was very cruel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d bloody on both Sides; but the Enemy was forced to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ound, and was pursued to the very Gates of the City, not∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thstanding the Besieged continually play'd upon our Men with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir great Guns and small Shot. Prince <HI>Eugenius</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s in great Danger, having his Horse killed under him. Prince <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>is</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Generals, <HI>Fontain</HI> and <HI>La Vargne,</HI> sig∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lized themselves in this Action, as did also the Volunteers; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t above all the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> who was in the hottest of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Engagement. The <HI>Sieur de Switterdael,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Regiment of <HI>Staina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> was there kill'd, with seven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thirty Soldiers, and six Volunteers, besides sixty two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unded, among which was a Captain, two Lieutenants, and an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sign; but the Loss of the Turks was much more considerable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that our Souldiers brought away sixty Heads, and by a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>scian</HI> Deserter we understood afterwards that the Turks had
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>above two hundred of their Men killed and wounded in that En∣counter. That Evening, upon the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, they began to play the four Mortar Piecey planted near the great Battery, and to shoot Bombs upon the Enemies Batteries. Six Culverins also were planted upon the old Battery, formerly raised to make a Breach in the low Town, design'd to play directly upon the Gate of the City, and disturb the Sallys of the Besieged.</P>
<P>The 30. The Forces of <HI>Suabia</HI> and <HI>Franconia</HI> arrived in the Camp, and took the Posts which had been assigned them. All the Night and all the Day were spent in advancing our Works, which were so numerous, that they could hardly be distinguished one from another. This Night there were but two Souldiers killed, and some few wounded. The Count of <HI>Souches,</HI> who commanded this day in the Trenches, having sent three Granadeers to ob∣serve the Distance between our Approaches and the Roundel, brought word that it was not above three hundred Paces, and that the Enemy was hard at work in making a deep Trench at the Foot of the Roundel, and that having gone a great way forwarder on the left side, than on the right, they had encreased their number of Workemen on the right side. All night long, Bavins, Gabions, Munition, and Provision, were sent to the Camp in great abundance, through the Care of the Count <HI>de Rabata</HI> Commissary General. The same day General <HI>Caprara</HI> left the Camp with the Cavalry of <HI>Suabia,</HI> to head the Cavalry encamped near <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> which he was to command in chief. Five Rascian Shepherds also coming out of the City to feed a∣long by the Walls, surrendred themselves with above four hun∣dred Sheep to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Quarter, who caused 'em to be well rewarded. They could give nothing of Information, only that there was a great Consternation among the Besieged; ne∣vertheless that they were resolved to defend themselves in expecta∣tion of the Succour which they were promised; moreover that our Bombs and Carcasses had set fire to several parts of the City, which had been fortunately quenched.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>July.</HI> Yesterday in the Evening General <HI>Schoning,</HI> who commands the Auxiliary Forces of <HI>Bradenb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgh,</HI> arrived in the Camp: And this Morning Camp-Marshal-General <HI>Sta∣renburgh</HI> shewed him the Approaches, and the Attack which was reserved for his Men; which was toward the water side, to the left of the Imperialists; after which he was magnificently treated by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and having had a Conference with his
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>Highness, where was also present General <HI>Starenburgh,</HI> he returned to meet his Forces that were expected the next day, or the next day after at farthest. This morning the Imperasists began to shoot from their new Battery of four Pieces carrying twenty four pound Ball. The five Mortar Pieces also near the great Battery, continued playing upon the round Tower upon the right Hand, with such Success, that the Besieged durst not appear there any more. The same day they finished their Works, and made two Redoubts to secure a Communication with the great Battery. This Night we had but five wounded and one slain; but in the morning Adjutant General <HI>Mercy</HI> was wounded in the Head with a Musket as he was carrying Orders to the Approaches. There was nothing done in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarter this day, only they advanced their Works, and their Batteries had made a Breach in the Rampart without: And the same day the remainder of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Forces arrived, consisting of 1400 Foot, which were added to the rest of the same Circle.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 2. Our Approaches on the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack side were ad∣vanced within two hundred Paces of the Wall of the City. The night before was finished a Battery of twelve pieces of Cannon, carrying twenty four pound ball; and four Mortar Pieces more were planted near the first, that play'd without ceasing, and fir'd the last night a part of the City next the great Church, which burnt till morning. Nevertheless we continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ooting with our great Guns against the two first round Towers, which were left almost defenceless. The two Battalians also of <HI>Keyserstein</HI> and <HI>Croy,</HI> were commanded to reinforce those that lay encamped un∣der the Wall of the low Town. The Enemy likewise shot down several Bombs and Stones, without doing us any great Mischief, only that they kill'd us two or three Soldiers. The same day the Troops of <HI>Suabia</HI> began their Line of Circumval∣lation, and the next night raised a Battery upon the Hill which they possess. In the mean time the <HI>Bavarians</HI> play'd very furi∣ously against the Castle and the high Town, and shot in several Bombs, which occasioned a new Conflagration, which was not quenched in a good while. And now the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> ap∣prehensive lest the Turks might in the night time, by the help of small Barks, get in Men and Provisions into <HI>Buda,</HI> went perso∣nally to view the Places adjoyning to <HI>Pest,</HI> and commanded the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Regiment of Dragoons to post themselves in the Town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that they might be ready to assist the <HI>Hungarians</HI> who
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>lay there, and had orders to raise certain little Forts upon the Banks of the <HI>Danaw.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 3. This morning arriv'd the Troops of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> from the other side of the <HI>Danaw,</HI> that lay encamped near our Bridge. Soon after came the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to take a view of 'em, and was received by General <HI>Schoning</HI> with three Volleys of Musque∣teers rang'd in Battalia, and three Peals of Artillery planted at the head of the Infantry. His Highness also was entertain'd with much splendor at Dinner, and then return'd to his Quarters extreamly satisfied to have seen such a considerable Body of Men, stout and active, and so well provided with a noble Train of Artillery. The same day the Imperialists finish'd another Line for the defence of their Trenches. They also fired very furiously with their Can∣non and Mortar Pieces; so that they not only made a considera∣ble Breach in the Wall, but also ruin'd the Batteries upon the two first Roundels, from whence the Enemy fired without Intermis∣sion. On the other side, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> advanced their Lines to the Castle, and raised a new Battery on the right hand toward the <HI>Danaw,</HI> upon which they planted nine Mortar Pieces, which did wonderful Execution. Three days before this, they play'd from a Battery of seven Demi-Cannons against the round Tower, while from another of four Pieces they belabour'd the Flanks: they like∣wise raised a new Battery of eight Pieces to beat down the left side of the Roundel. Seven men were kill'd in the Lorrain Attack, and some wounded. This day in the Afternoon, an Ensign of the Janisaries rendred himself to the Camp, having deserted his own Party for having kill'd a Turkish Officer in a Duel. He assured us that of true Janisaries, there were not above fifteen hundred in the Garrison; but that what with the <HI>Saphi</HI>'s, <HI>Albanians,</HI> and others, they made up the number of seven thousand fighting Men. He ad∣ded, that the Bombs and Carcasses had already ruined several Edi∣fices, and occasioned great destruction both of Men and Cattel. That the Besieged were very busie in making a Mine behind the Breach of the Lorrain Attack; and that till that very hour, there had not any person entred the place. As for General <HI>Dunewald,</HI> he forbore to prosecute his Design upon <HI>Palotta,</HI> finding it was provided with a good Garrison; a Party of which had kill'd some of his Men that went to take a view of the place. Another Par∣ry also of the Garrison of <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> had met withal, and routed some Forragers of the Horse that were quartered in the Neighbourhood, and kill'd among others Count <HI>Papenheim,</HI> Captain of Horse in the Bavarian Troops.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
<P><HI>July</HI> 4. They advanced so far with their Approaches in the Lorrain Attack, that they were got within a hundred Paces of the Breach of the Roundel on the right hand. The Enemy also began to make a Line without the Breach about fifty Paces from our Works, to render the Breach more inaccessible; and though they fired continually all night long with their Musquets, and slung an infinite number of Stones, we had but thirteen men kill'd and wounded. And now had we fourteen Mortar Pieces planted that shot Bombs and Carcasses continually without ceasing. In the Ba∣varian Attack, but only what concern'd the securing our Works, and advancing the Batteries. This morning a Polonian that serv'd the Turks, render'd himself to the Camp, and reported that the besieged were resolv'd to Surrender, if they were not reliev'd within a Month: and another Deserter in the afternoon came and declared that the besieged had the night before landed five Horse∣men ashore on <HI>Pest</HI> side, who were to take several Roads, that one at least might get safe to the <HI>Serasquier,</HI> and press him to hasten the Relief that he had promis'd. On the other side the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sent a Detachment of Horse toward <HI>Voitfar,</HI> to destroy the Grass and Corn, and watch the Motion of the Enemy. Of this some Tartars had Intelligence, and snapt some of our Forragers on the other side of the <HI>Danaw;</HI> they also took some Horses, and two Grooms belonging to Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> who were in St. <HI>Marget</HI>'s Island.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 5. Last night sixty Granadeers, with some Pioneers, were commanded to go and ruin the Line which the Enemy had the day before begun before the breach of the Roundel, which succeeded so well, that they filled up the breach without the loss of more than two Soldiers. By this time also the breaches were made wider and wider, as well where the Lorrainers, as where the Bavarians attacked, and what the Turks repaired in the night, was by us overthrown in the day time. And now all the Bavarians were come up and joyned together in their Quarters; upon whom the Enemy made a Sally in the night time; and though they were bravely received, and purfued to the very Gates of the City, yet they lost many gallant and stout Men, and among the rest the Son of Camp-Marshal-General <HI>Dorfeling,</HI> an Ingineer, two Lieutenants, and seven and twenty Soldiers, besides the same num∣ber wounded.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 6. There was a Line of Communication made from the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Attack to that of the <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> not above
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>fifty Paces from the Gate in the middle and about sixty Paces from the breach on the right hand. This morning the Cannon played so furiously, that they utterly beat down the two Roundels with the Curtain; and when night came they shot without ceasing Bombs and Granadoes, that kindled a fire near the Roundel, on the right hand, that lasted three hours. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and General <HI>Starenbergh</HI> stay'd till eleven of Clock at night in the Approaches, to encourage the Workmen with their presence. The <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> also had by this time vigorously advanced their Works, their Generals of Battalia alternatively relieving one ano∣ther in their Trenches. The Sieur <HI>Fonk,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel to <HI>Souches,</HI> was wounded in the Leg, with six Soldiers, and two killed. The <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> had a Captain of Granadeers wounded, with six Soldiers, and eight slain.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 7. Last night a great number of Bombs were shot into the Town, which did great Execution, in regard the fire was seen to blaze out in several parts of the City; though greater Execution was expected to be done upon the Arrival of <HI>Gonzales</HI> our Ingi∣neer, who was lookt for in the Camp within two or three days, whither the great Guns, Mortar Pieces, Bombs, Carcasses, and other Artificial Fire-works were already arrived. This morning the Enemy sallied out upon the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> Attack with Horse and Foot, but greatly to their disadvantage; being so vigorously receiv'd, that they were forced to retire in great disorder, being pursued under the very Walls of the City: there were also prepa∣ring their Batteries to be ready in two days, when they resolved to be heard as loud as the rest of their Friends. Yesterday the Miners began to work upon the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack to widen the breaches, and this night the same was done upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> At∣tack, where they had by this finish'd two new Batteries, the one of ten, the other of seven Pieces of Cannon; and a third was raising toward the water side, to level the attacked Roundel, and a gate through which the besieged sallied out very frequently to get into a close way which they had made before the said Roun∣del. Yesterday the <HI>Bavarians</HI> advanc'd their Approaches to the foot of the Castle, so that they could approach no nearer till the breach were enlarged. And indeed the Works in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> At∣tack were so near the Wall, that they could not advance any nearer without lodging upon the breach. So that there were above fifty men killed and wounded in the three Attacks. Yester night the Enemy shot a Bomb, which lighting into a barrel of Powder, kill'd nine of our Cannoneers.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
<P>The 8th was busily employ'd upon the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, in rais∣ing nearer the Walls two new Batteries of three Demi-Cannons each; and upon the left hand, where we had not carried on our Approaches as upon the left, they advanced their Approaches to the very Wall of the Roundel; which being a work to be done so near the Enemy, cost us five and twenty Soldiers, kill'd and wounded, the most part with Stones and Granadoes, among whom was Major General <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngen,</HI> who was upon the Guard of the Trenches with the Count <HI>de Souches.</HI> The Sieur <HI>Bischoffhansen</HI> Serjcant Major of one of the <HI>Suabian</HI> Regiments, had his Arm broken with a Musket shot; one of <HI>Starenbergh</HI>'s Captains was wounded in the shoulder, and <HI>Souches</HI>'s Captain Lieutenant in the Foot. As for the Miners that were ordered to sapp under the right side of the <HI>Roundel,</HI> had not as yet met with any Mines of the E∣nemy. This evening others were set to work upon the left side of the middle Roundel: and this night Captain <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rger</HI> of <HI>Staren∣bergh</HI>'s Regiment, who had been wounded in the Mouth in the Salley upon the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> died of his wound. Some Country∣men having found a means to make their Escapes out of the City, came the same night to our Camp, and assured us that there were not above three hundred men that laboured constantly in the Mines and the Retrenchment which the Enemies were making behind the Wall, whither to retire in case of necessity.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 9. All night long there was nothing done but shooting of Bombs and Carcasses into the City, to keep the besieged in Action, and to deprive them of their Repose. But by break of day the Enemy perceiving that we had made a Gallery of Planks to pass the Miners over to the middle Roundel, rowl'd down several Bombs, threw Granadoes, and other Fire-works, with all sorts of combustible Materials in such abundance, that the fire caught hold of the Planks, and reduced the Gallery to Ashes, which obliged our Miners to come away, and desist from their work till the next night. This morning about five a clock the Enemy sprung a Mine some Paces without the Wall, between the middle Roundel and that of the Gate, which succeeded so well, that it overthrew one of our Mines, where we had seven or eight of our Miners, some kill'd and some wounded. After that they made a Salley, put our Pioneers into disorder, destroy'd some of our Works, and posted themselves between the <HI>Imperialists</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers.</HI> But the Reserve flying thither from the Main-guard, constrained the Enemy, after a sharp Encounter of half an hour, to regain
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>the City. We had forty of ours kill'd and wounded, and the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> had few less, among whom was one of their best Cannoneers, and some Inferiour Officers. The Enemy left behind them above fourscore slain, besides what were wounded. But notwithstanding this rude check to their Success, the besiegers went on with the same vigour as before with their Approaches, their Lines and their Galleries. And the <HI>Bavarians</HI> yesterday ruin'd the little Gate near the Roundel, with a Battery of ten Pieces of Demy-Cannon, so that the breach was already become very broad.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 10th, In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack the men labour'd all night to repair the Batteries and Approaches ruin'd by the Salley which the Enemy made the day before, and to rebuild the Gallery which they had burn'd, so that they design'd to put the Miners to work that evening. On the <HI>Bavarian</HI> side the Miners were set to work under the Palisado of the Roundel, and under the Wall, in hopes that the Mines would be ready to spring in three days. We had Soldiers kill'd and wounded, among whom those of chiefest note were Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Wachtenheim,</HI> who com∣manded in one of the <HI>Suabian</HI> Regiments. At the same time we had Intelligence by our Spies that the Turks, to the number of seven thousand, re-inforced by the Tartars that ramble about the Country, had a design to put a new Governour into <HI>Buda,</HI> with a Supply of Men; which obliged the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to com∣mand some Infantry to post themselves on the other side the <HI>Da∣naw,</HI> and joyn in case of necessity with the Cavalry which lay there, and to meet and fight the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 11. This night five Demi-Cannon were planted upon the new Batteries in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, and two Mortar Pieces upon a little Fort adjoyning, with the loss only of two Soldiers slain, and five wounded. The <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> planted three Pieces upon a Battery, and the next night they planted a greater number to shoot red hot Bullets into the City. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> likewise secured their Works with two Redoubts. Yesterday in the evening four hun∣dred commanded Foot were sent upon <HI>Pest</HI> side to raise some De∣sences upon the <HI>Danaw</HI> to prevent the putting of any Relief into <HI>Buda.</HI> And now the Command of Lieutenant Colonel to <HI>Souches</HI> being vacant by the death of the Sieur <HI>Fonck,</HI> who dy'd yester∣day of his wound in the Leg, it was conferred upon the Count of <HI>Herlerstein,</HI> Serjeant Major to <HI>La Vergne.</HI></P>
<P>The 12. All the Batteries were finished, as well in the <HI>Lorrain</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>Attack, as in that of the <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> and the first Lines of these two Attacks were joyned in such a manner, that the men might pass from the one to the other secure from the Shot of the Enemy. For being so near the Wall as they were, the Besieged did nothing but throw Granado's, and sling Stones, to disturb the Workmen: But being thus secured, the damage they did us was inconsiderable. The Miners in the Mine on the Lefthand, were already far advanced under the Wall: But in that upon the Right-hand they met with more difficulty, and therefore they resolved to widen the Breach with their Cannon. Last Night the Count <HI>de Souches,</HI> who commanded in the Trenches, caused the Breach to be viewed by the Orders of Count <HI>Starenbergh,</HI> and it was found wide enough to make an Assault. The <HI>Brandenburgh∣ers</HI> also this day began to shoot red-hot Bullets and Bombs into the City, with twenty two Cannons and two Mortar-Pieces; but they did no great Execution, in regard the Besieged had taken away all the Rafters of their Houses. And yet the Bombs and Carcasses invented by the Franciscan Fryer, and the Spanish En∣gineer, may be said to work Wonders. Nevertheless the main business of this day was to widen and level the Breaches; and we had this day nine wounded and three killed, by the Granado's and Stones. As for the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> the Breach which they had made in the great Roundel was by this time wide enough, and the Miners were at work under the Palisado of the Trench. Ye∣sterday the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having Intelligence that the Seras∣quier was advanced with some thousand <HI>Turks</HI> as far as <HI>Hatwan,</HI> commanded Three thousand Horse, and six Battalions of Infan∣try, <HI>Imperialists, Bavarians,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> under the Con∣duct of General Baron <HI>de Mercy,</HI> to pass the <HI>Danaw,</HI> and post themselves on the other side of the Bridge, to prevent the Enemy from putting any Relief into the Town, with a new Governor, called <HI>Achmet Bassa,</HI> reputed one of the best Officers that the <HI>Turk</HI> has in his Service.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 13. This morning the Enemy sprung a Mine at the mid∣dle Roundel near to ours, that was already finished, without so much as the loss of one Man of our side: Tho on the other side it did the Execution which ours ought to have done, and overthrew a part of the Roundel, where as yet we had not made any Breach. There were two hundred <HI>Turks</HI> who were ready to have fallen pell mell into our Works so soon as the Mine was sprung; but finding it had done an Execution quite contrary to
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>what they expected, they retir'd. And now all things being in a Readiness for an Assault, to the end they might post themselves upon the Wall; Count <HI>Starenbergh</HI> directed the Attack in the following manner. Count <HI>Guido Starenbergh,</HI> Lieutenant Collo∣nel to the Regiment of that Name, was commanded upon the right hand against the Roundel: Count <HI>de Herbersteen,</HI> Serjeant Major to <HI>Scherffenbergh</HI> was in the middle of the Curtin, and the Count <HI>d' Averspergh</HI> Lieutenant Collonel to <HI>Mansfield</HI> had the left hand. They had each two hundred and eighty Soldiers: The Engineers, Granadeers, Fuseleers, Carpenters, and Pioneers, were posted between them and the rest, to the number of two thousand men were divided into three Bodies of Reserve, to sup∣port and relieve the Assailants. The Volunteers, who had re∣quested that Station, intermixed themselves among the first. Be∣tween seven and eight of the Clock in the Evening the Signal was given to mount the Breaches, with a Peal from all the Bat∣teries, and a showre of Bombs and Carcasses that were shot against the City and the Retrenchments of the Enemy behind the breach. Nor could all the Resistance of the Enemy prevent our men from mounting, where the combat was very obstinate on both sides, and maintained for the space of three quarters of an Hour with all the bravery imaginable: At what time the Enemy also sprang a Mine under our first Line, which buried Captain <HI>Kalkreiter</HI> of <HI>Starenbergh</HI>'s Regiment, and some Soldiers. But at length, finding we could not get footing for want of Ground, that we could not force the Pallisado'd Retrenchment of the Besieged behind the Breach, and that our chief Officers were al∣ready all either wounded or killed by the continual firing of the Enemy, it was thought convenient to cause the Assailants to re∣treat, who had fought like Lions, and of which five were so va∣liant as to throw themselves into the Retrenchment, and yet to bring themselves off and retire with the rest; who, had they been but duly succoured, perhaps there would have needed no farther work to have lodged upon the Breach. However the Retreat was made in good Order. The Regiments of <HI>Souches</HI> and <HI>Mansfield</HI> suffered most in this Action; and <HI>Starenbergh</HI>'s also was very much damnified. There were about four hundred killed and wounded: but that which was more particularly to be de∣plored, was the loss of so many brave Officers and Volunteers. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Camp-Marshal-General <HI>Starenbergh</HI> were present at this Action, giving Orders every where as occa∣sion
<PB N="27" REF="16"/>required. Few of the wounded escaped, which is the Rea∣son some believe the Turks do shoot with poyson'd Bullets. A∣mong the dead were the Count <HI>de Herberstein</HI> Serjeant Major to <HI>Scherffenbergh,</HI> the Count of <HI>Kuffstein,</HI> a Captain to <HI>Starembergh,</HI> with another Captain of the same Regiment. The Baron of <HI>Rolle,</HI> the <HI>Sieur Kirchmeyer,</HI> one of <HI>Souches</HI>'s Captains; and two of <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s Captains, with eight Ensigns and Lieutenants of Infantry. Of the Volunteers that were slain or died of their Wounds, the chief were the Duke of <HI>Vejar,</HI> Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> who behaved himself with so much Courage that he was one of the first upon the Breach. Prince <HI>Robert</HI>'s Son, with another English Lord, the Baron of <HI>Scheyffer,</HI> the Son of the Count of <HI>Maldegem,</HI> the young Count of <HI>Courmaillon,</HI> a Count of <HI>Donaw,</HI> and seven or eight other Persons of Quality. Among the wound∣ed, as well Officers as Volunteers, there was Lieutenant-Collonel <HI>Guido de Starenbergh</HI> wounded with the splinter of a Granado in the Shoulder, and a Musket Bullet in the Foot, Lieutenant Col∣lonel the Count <HI>d' Averspergh</HI> in the Foot, but not dangerously; and indeed there were few of the rest of the Officers escaped; the Prince of <HI>Veldens,</HI> of the <HI>Palatine</HI> Family, Prince <HI>Picolomine,</HI> two English Lords, the Duke of <HI>Escalona,</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain;</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Valero,</HI> Brother to the Duke of <HI>Vejar;</HI> the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> and above thirty other Volunteers of Quality. The Spanish and English distinguished themselves, and fighting to out∣vye one another, endured the main Fury of the Enemy. And indeed the English suffered very much: For of twenty, all Per∣sons of Quality, there were not above six that were not either killed or wounded. The Loss of the Besieged was also very great, for by what we understood afterwards, they had above two hundred of their chiefest Men killed and wounded. It was thought the <HI>Bran∣denburghers</HI> would have made an Attempt on their side, but they excused themselves, alledging that their Breach was not then wide enough. However the Turks upon the Retreat of our Men, made a little sally upon their Attack; but were repulsed with the loss of twenty four of their Party. Upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> side they had made a considerable Breach in the Roundel, and in the Wall that secures the Castle, which the Besieged repair'd every Night with Gabions, Palisado's, and Bavins.</P>
<P>The 14th. All the night and day was spent in burying the dead and repairing the Approaches, in planting more Cannon upon the Batteries, and in carrying on the Mines, the Miners being actually
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>set to work under Ground on the side of the great Roundel. Two Galleries were also built toward the Curtin, between the twelfth and thirteenth Roundel. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> also having sent for three Regiments of Horse from near <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> to go and re-inforce General <HI>Mercy,</HI> the Count <HI>de Caprara</HI> detach'd the Re∣giments of <HI>Trusches, Taff,</HI> and <HI>Stirum,</HI> who this morning pass'd the Bridge on <HI>Pest</HI> side. In the evening the besieged sprung a Mine in the <HI>Eavarian</HI> Attack, on the left hand of the Roundel of the Castle, which succeeded very ill. The same day his Ele∣ctoral Highness having caus'd eight Parapets of thick oaken Planks plaited with Iron, (being a new Invention, found them very pro∣per) to be made use of in Assaults and Attacks, every Parapet be∣ing sufficient to secure a hundred armed men. The same day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> discovered and disappointed five Mines of the Ene∣mies.</P>
<P>The 15th. They went on finishing their Lines, and being to dig under the Wall, they heard the Enemy at work under the breach. This day the Sieur <HI>Gonzales</HI> arriv'd, and shot his Bombs and Carcasses into the City, which did great Execution, where five or six were kill'd and wounded. This day the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> ha∣ving intelligence that the Convoy of the Enemy which had pass'd the <HI>Tibiscus</HI> near <HI>Segedin,</HI> lay still encamp'd under the Cannon of the Fortress of <HI>Hatwan,</HI> his Excellency sent for two Regiments of Horse more to joyn with General <HI>Mercy,</HI> with a design to con∣strain the Enemy to repass the River.</P>
<P>On the 16th a new Battery was erected in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack without the Wall of the low Town on the right hand, against the great Roundel, which was also battered on the other side to make the breach the larger. This day a <HI>Rascian</HI> coming out of the Ci∣ty, with a Packet of Letters which the Governor of the place had intrusted him with, to carry to the Governour of <HI>Alba Rega∣tis,</HI> rendred himself in the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Quarters. But in regard the Letters were written in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Language, and for that there was never an Interpreter in the Camp, they sent them to <HI>Vienna</HI> to be deciphered. Some Country People also making their Escape from the Town, reported that the <HI>Jani∣zaries</HI> began to murmur against the Governour for being so obsti∣nate to let things go to the utmost extremity; but that by the pu∣nishment of the Mutineers, by means of his Money, and a strong assurance of speedy Succour, he had so well confirm'd the rest in their duty, that they promised to hold out to the last drop of
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>blood. This evening the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> commanded a hundred and fifty men, seconded by a great number, to attack the Palisado in the Trench at the foot of the Roundel of the Ca∣stle, the Lieutenant General the Count of <HI>Fontain,</HI> undertook the Attack on the right hand, and the Count of <HI>Aspremont</HI> on the left. And this was the first time they made use of three Parapets of Wood, which were very profitable to us; and they attackt that post so vigorously, that they carried it by dint of Sword, and cut to pieces all that were in it; but they sold their Lives dear however, for we had there the Count of <HI>Fontain</HI> kill'd, with five and thirty Soldiers and Volunteers. The Count of <HI>Aspremont</HI> was very much bruis'd in the Head with a Musket-bullet, which strook off his Steel-cap. Baron <HI>Gottalisky</HI> Captain of <HI>Beck</HI>'s Regi∣ment, and the Sieur <HI>Vaubon</HI> Captain of the Granadeers of <HI>Baden,</HI> were both dangerously wounded, with several others. However this Post gave us access to the Roundel.</P>
<P>The 17. Yesterday the Enemy began to shoot from a new Bat∣tery of four great Pieces which they had raised within the inner Wall; but General <HI>Starenbergh,</HI> giving order to the Gunners to play upon it with several Pieces, they so utterly destroyed that Bat∣tery in a short time, that the besieged could make no farther use of it. About noon twenty or thirty <HI>Janisaries</HI> shew'd themselves upon the breach of the Roundel on the right hand, but the Soldiers from the Trenches firing upon 'em, they retired immediately. The Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> arrived in the Camp yesterday in the evening, with Commission to be General of the Artillery. This day <HI>Capra∣ra</HI>'s and <HI>Newburgh</HI>'s Regiment of Horse marched to joyn General <HI>Mercy.</HI> As for the <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> they did little this day but mind the finishing of their Works, and fired conti∣nually from their Batteries.</P>
<P>The 18. We advanced some Paces with a new Line to the right, the better to protect our Miners that wrought in two distinct places under the Curtin, and to make use of it in the next Assault. The <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> enlarged their great Battery of three Pieces of Cannon. Nor were the <HI>Bavarians</HI> idle, for their Miners were at work under the Wall behind the Palliasado'd Trench, of which they had made themselves Masters. As for the Enemy, he seldom now appear'd in the day time; but in the night time they kept siring continually, and kill'd us a great many men, with their Stones and Granadoes, which they flung into our Works.</P>
<P>The 19. The Cannon was planted upon the new Battery, and
<PB N="30" REF="18"/>the Line was secured with two little Forts. Last night the Enemy sprang a Mine behind our Miners that wrought under the Wall, which damnified our Mine, into which there was a necessity to make a new Entrance, to make it serviceable again. Some of our Miners were almost buried in the Earth, but they were all fortu∣nately recovered again, except the Sieur <HI>Libert</HI> their Captain, whose Body could not not be found. Mr. <HI>Kerry,</HI> Brother to my Lord <HI>Ouberry,</HI> a Scotch Lord was kill'd in the Approaches with a Musket bullet, together with seven or eight Soldiers, and some wounded. This morning the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> held a Council of War, where were present the Generals of his Army; but the De∣termination was kept secret. Some Deserters also came to the Camp this day, and assured us that the besieged would come to no Composition, but were resolved to wait the Relief which the <HI>Grand Visier</HI> should bring them.</P>
<P>The 20. The new Line in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack was finished. Three false Alarms also were given to the besieged only to harrass them, by causing certain Granadeers to mount the Breach, who threw Granadoes into the Place, upon which the <HI>Turks</HI> hastning to make defence, were saluted with several Cannon-shot, Bombs and Car∣casses that did good Execution. Which sort of Attacks were fre∣quently, to keep the Enemy in continual Alarm, and in ignorance of the time of the really design'd Assault. Moreover, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go∣rousloy carried on their Mines; a certain <HI>German</HI> undertaking a new one, which he promised to finish in two or three days. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Attacks there was nothing pass'd con∣siderable, only that the Miners hop'd the next night to be under the Roundels. They also continued battering the Walls with great fury, and shoting red hot Bullets, Bombs, and Carcasses into the City, which did very much mischief. Upon Informati∣on given that the <HI>Turks</HI> prepared to relieve the place, the Trench of the Line of Circumvallation was made deeper; and strength∣ned with certain Redoubts, the better to secure the besiegers; to which purpose two hundred <HI>Heydukes</HI> were added to the number of Pioneers.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 21. The principal Work now carried on was that of the Mines, which were opened in three several parts. Nor could Captain <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s body yet be found, though all diligence has been used to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow the Earth in that place where his body was by all conjecture lost. He was an Officer, a <HI>Walloon</HI> by Nation, much lamented by all the Generals, and by all that knew his Experience
<PB N="31" REF="18"/>in the business of Mining: Our Miners also heard the Enemy at work, but they went on with their own work for all that. A Battery was likewise raised for four Mortar Pieces, near that of the three Spanish Pieces, which batter the Roundel on the right Hand. Moreover all the Cannons and Mortar Pieces were de∣signed to be planted nearer the Breaches, on purpose to widen them with more ease, and ruin the Defences of the Enemy, which are behind the said Breaches: We had in the Lorrain Attack only twenty seven killed and wounded, among whom were Ser∣jeant Major <HI>Boeneburgh,</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> and the <HI>Sieur Lerneux,</HI> the fifth Captain of <HI>Starenbergh</HI>'s Regiment. The <HI>Sieur Gonzale</HI>'s Bombs and Carcasses have had the success which was expected; For by the Report of a Deserter, one of those Bombs falling yesterday into the City, made its way into a House, into which were retired above a Hundred Persons of both Sexes, who were all miserably buried in the Ruins of it. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> finished their Battery near the Roundel, and began another toward the water side, to batter the Flanks of the City on that side. And now the three Attacks having made their Approaches to the Breaches that now seem'd wide enough, all things were preparing for a general Assault, there being two thousand scaling Ladders in a readiness to make false Attacks and scale the Walls, while others mounted the Breaches.</P>
<P>The 22. Nothing passed considerable in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, nor in that of the <HI>Brandenburgher:</HI> but the Enemy this morning sprang two Mines, which did no other Execution than only ruin a part of the Curtin, where there was no Breach before. The new Battery likewise of four pieces upon the brink of the Ditch of the Roundel being finished, the Turks gave 'em a most bloody Serenade by break of day; for sallying out in a good number, they stole down into the Trench along the Palisade, and being come to the said Battery before they were discovered, through the darkness of the Night, they set up a most dreadful How∣ling and Hollowing, nayl'd three pieces of Cannon and a Mortar, and ruined some part of the Gabions of the Battery: The <HI>Saxons</HI> of the adjoining Posts hastning to the Relief of their Friends, were put into some Disorder; but Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Badens</HI> Re∣giment, being the Reserve, coming up in time, repelled the Ene∣my with the loss of thirty men stain. Which was but a small thing in comparison of the Loss which we suffered, which a∣mounted to above a hundred killed and wounded, the most part
<PB N="33" REF="19"/><HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Bavarians.</HI> Among the slain were Collonel <HI>Lehel</HI> of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Forces, and some inferiour Officers: The Sieur <HI>Gesch∣wint,</HI> Collonel of the Artillery, was also dangerously gashed and hack'd with a Scimiter. However the <HI>Turks</HI> got no advantage by this Salley; for the Nails being easily pull'd out of the Can∣non and Mortar, within an hour after they began to play a∣gain as if they had never been nail'd. And the revenge which they returned was speedy; for one of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Bombs light∣ing into the Magazin of Powder in the Castle, the whole Pile blew up into the Air with such a hideous havock and thundring noise, as not only shook the whole City, but our Camp likewise; and by what we afterwards understood from the Deserters, there miserably perished by that blow above a thousand persons of all Ages, which were buried in the Ruins of the Buildings, the Stones of which were thrown with that violence and vast quantity into the Approaches, that they resembled a showr of Hail, and wound∣ed several of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>The 23. the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sent in the Afternoon the Count of <HI>Conningsegg</HI> with an Interpreter to the besieged, with a Sum∣mons to surrender, in regard all the Mines were ready to spring, and all things were prepared for a general Assault: During which time there was a Cessation of Arms on both sides, which was spent in the Interment of the slain. The said Count, after he had been two hours in the City, returned to the Camp with a Letter from <HI>Abdi Bassa</HI> in a Purse of red Damask, which he de∣livered to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> wherein the <HI>Bassa</HI> made him a haughty and arrogant Answer, purporting, That not being neces∣sitated to a Surrender, he could not dream of such a vile piece of Cowardice: that he fought for the Glory of his <HI>Prophet,</HI> and the Honour of the <HI>Mussel-men:</HI> that he and his Garrison were resol∣ved to hold out to the utmost Extremty, and defend it to the last gasp of Breath: that the place being intrusted to his care by the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> he would preserve it, or lose his Life: that when the Duke should come to wrest it from him, he should find him upon the Breach ready to dispute his Entrance; and let him order the Assault when he pleased, he would expect him without stirring afoot.</P>
<P>The Duke having read this insolent Answer, caused all the Batteries to fire with greater fury than before, and caused all pre∣parations to be hastened to give a general Assault by break of day; to which purpose he sent for a thousand <HI>Hungarian</HI> Foot,
<PB N="33" REF="19"/>who had voluntarily offered themselves to mount the Breaches.</P>
<P>So haughty an Answer, and a Defence of the besieged so obsti∣nate and brave, shews us by Experience that the Characters which the Deserters had given us at the beginning of the Siege, of <HI>Abdi Bassa</HI>'s conduct, were utterly false, in saying he was contemptible to the Soldiery for being more a Merchant than a Soldier; and the <HI>Serasquier</HI> was to blame in going about to displace him as he had designed: for it is to be presumed that hardly any other than he, would have so long eluded the Fury of such a Potent Ar∣my.</P>
<P>This day some <HI>Bavarians,</HI> that kept the advanced Guards, ob∣serving that a <HI>Polonian,</HI> who served in our Army, had had a pri∣vate Conference with two <HI>Turks,</HI> seized upon him at his return to the Camp, and carried him to the Elector, where having been searched and examined, he was found to be a Spy, and that he had discovered to the Enemies all that had passed in our Camp; whereupon he was presently sentenced and executed without any more ado. This evening also a <HI>Bavarian</HI> Cannoneer was appre∣hended, who was going over to the Enemy, and had already pas∣sed the Guards.</P>
<P>The 24. This morning, about eight of the Clock, a large Mine was sprung in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, and three hundred chosen Foot were ordered out to lodg themselves upon the Breach, together with some hundreds of <HI>Hungarians:</HI> but the effect of the Mine was contrary to all expectation; for it ruined and overthrew a part of our Approaches, and filled our Lines with Earth, besides that we had a hundred men killed and wounded. Whereupon his Serene Highness seeing this ill Success, ordered the Batteries to redouble their firing to inlarge their Bteaches, and to reduce them to such a Condition, as to be mounted without making any Mines. The new Battery of the <HI>Bavarians</HI> toward the water side was fi∣nished this night; and that other which they had raised on the side of the Ditch, had already broken down a good part of the Wall on the right hand.</P>
<P>The same day the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sent Orders to the Count of <HI>Nigrelli,</HI> who commanded in <HI>Newhausel</HI> during the absence of the Count of <HI>Aspremont,</HI> to come to the Army and officiate the place of General of Battalia: by intercepted Letters also he was in∣formed that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> encouraged the besieged to defend themselves, promising that by the eighth or tenth of <HI>August</HI> at the farthest, he would come and relieve them with a formidable
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>Army. The same day likewise General <HI>Caprara,</HI> who commands the Body of the Imperial Forces upon the River <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> sent an Officer to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to give them the news of a great Advantage which he had gained upon the Garrison of <HI>Agria</HI> the fifteenth of this Month, by the means of two Ambuscadoes which he laid for the <HI>Turks;</HI> into which having drawn six hundred of those Barbarians, he utterly defeated 'em, kill'd three hundred upon the place, together with <HI>Osman Basha</HI> the Governour of <HI>Agria;</HI> and taken ninety Prisoners, among whom he found the <HI>Vice-Basha</HI> dangeroully wounded: and that in this Action General <HI>Heusler</HI> had behaved himself with his wonted Gallantry, as had also done the Sieurs <HI>Pecerhasi</HI> and <HI>Sem∣say</HI> with their <HI>Hungarians.</HI></P>
<P>The 25. Nothing was done but only carrying on the Reparati∣ons of the Works ruined by the Mine which was sprung the day before to our disadvantage. The Duke of <HI>Loarrin</HI> hastened with all the vigour imaginable the preparations for a general Assault, having ordered the making such parading places as were necessary within the Lines and Approaches: and the <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Bran∣denburghers</HI> did the like in their Quarters. Between four and five in the afternoon the besieged set fire to a little Mine on the right hand of the Roundel; which done, they sallied forth with two hundred foot, who were as soon repulsed by our men that were up∣on the Guard. The Enemy left fourteen behind them slain, and car∣ried some wounded along with 'em: A while after they salli'd out with a greater number upon the <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> who repelled 'em with the same ease: Not long after they returned with a greater number, and put the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> Guards into some disorder, which obliged the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to order the Re∣serve, that lay posted at the VVall of the low Town, to advance; which General <HI>Souches,</HI> who commanded the Trenches, divided into three parts; of which one was planted one on the left hand to∣ward the water side; the other entred the Approaches; and the third was ordered to stand firm near the <HI>Mosque.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> ordered the Battalions of <HI>Mansfield, Salm, Souches,</HI> to ad∣vance on the right hand. The Skirmish continued some time, and the Turks retreated several times, then made Head again, fil∣ling the Air with their barbarous Cries. The <HI>Heydukes,</HI> after the first discharge, encountred the <HI>Turks,</HI> but gave ground, and caus'd some confusion among ours that advanc'd upon the left of the o∣ther <HI>Mosque,</HI> whence the besieged fired with their Cannon, yet
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>without doing any considerable damage: so that the Enemy see∣ing they could gain nothing but blows, retired into the City. Count <HI>Starenburgh</HI> signalized himself in this Action, giving all ne∣cessary Orders to our men; but his <HI>Adjutant</HI> had both his Legs carried away by a Cannon shot. The Battalions of <HI>Souches</HI> and <HI>Mansfield</HI> were but coursely handled, of whom many were slain. The Baron <HI>d' Asti</HI> was wounded in the Foot, the Baron of <HI>Hoben∣warth</HI> slain, and some inferiour Officers were likewise kill'd and wounded, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>out an hundred common Soldiers. But the loss of the <HI>Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> was much more considerable, as we understood by a <HI>German</HI> boy who made his escape out of the City, where he had been ever since the <HI>Turks</HI> were beaten from <HI>Vienna,</HI> by whom he had been taken and sold to an Inhabitant of <HI>Buda.</HI> This boy reported that the <HI>Turks</HI> made great Intrenchments within the Town, and that the Garison was still five thousand fighting men. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack there was nothing passed considera∣ble.</P>
<P>The 26. During the whole Siege never was more diligence used in carrying on to perfection the Lines and Approaches than last night, and all this, as also for the making of Parading Places, which were by this time finished, and every thing prepared for a general Assault, and to lodg themselves upon the breaches of the Roun∣dels and Walls, so that at length we might make our selves Ma∣sters of that Important Place that had already cost us so much blood. This day likewise the besieged made a slight salley upon the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> Quarters, which proved to their disadvantage; for they were constrained, after they had stood the first Charge, to retreat back to the City faster than they came.</P>
<P>The 27. All things being ready at length for a general Assault, and the Companies that were to serve in this Action being drawn up in their several Parading Places, as well in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack as in those of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> it was resolved that the Onset should be given about five in the Evening, to which purpose the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had given out his Orders to all the Officers, both Superiour and Inferiour, what they were to do. The Faggots, Gabions, Spades, Pickaxes, Hatchets, and Sacks of Earth were all in a readiness, as well to dig down the In∣trenchments of the Enemies, as for the Defence of the Assailants, when they should be Masters of the Breach. The Signal was gi∣ven from <HI>Pest,</HI> by the discharge of some great Guns; and the Assault was managed after the following manner. Forty Grana∣deers
<PB N="36" REF="21"/>under a Captain Lieutenant and Serjeant, were placed first at the head of the Right-hand-Roundel, they were followed by fifty Fuseleers, and fifty Souldiers with Hatchets, under a Captain Lieutenant, and Serjeant. These were first to mount the Breach and drive away the Enemy. A Captain, a Lieutenant, and Ser∣jeant, with a hundred men carrying Spades and Pickaxes, made the first Line, seconded by two Captains, two Lieutenants, and two Serjeants, with two hundred Musqueteers, the whole under the Prince of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> grand Master of the Teutonick Order, who had the management of this Attack. That of the middle, toward the Curtin was under the Direction of Lieutenant-General <HI>Souches;</HI> to carry on that, were fifty Granadeers under a Captain, a Lieutenant, and a Serjeant. One hundred Fuseleers under a Captain, a Lieutenant, and a Serjeant; and to second these there were two Captains, two Lieutenants, and two Serjeants, with two hundred Musqueteers, divided into two squadrons, followed by a hundred men with Shovels and Pickaxes.</P>
<P>The Attack on the left hand of the little Roundel was ordered by the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> after the following manner.</P>
<P>In the second Line behind the sacks fill'd with Earth, Wool, and such like materials, were posted the Arquebusiers, made choice of upon this occasion, who were not to stir, but to fire continually upon the Turks that should shew themselves upon the Breaches. The <HI>Heydukes,</HI> commanded by the Deputy-Go∣vernor of <HI>Raab,</HI> were posted toward the Water-side, where a great part of the Wall was thrown down by the Fire which hap∣pened in the Magazine, which had been blown up some days before. They were only to make a false Attack, and were se∣conded by a Serjeant Major, with some select Companies. The superior Officers possessed several Posts to do the Duty of their Employments. To which purpose the Marquess of <HI>Nigrelli,</HI> Ge∣neral of Battalia, Collonel <HI>Keth,</HI> and the Baron <HI>de Rederer,</HI> and the Serjeant-Major of <HI>Starenbergh</HI> stood by the grand Master of the Teutonic Order. Lieutenant-General <HI>Souches</HI> had for his As∣sistants Baron <HI>Diependael,</HI> General of Battalia, the Count <HI>D'Oe∣tinghen,</HI> Collonel, Lieutenant-Collonel <HI>Jonger,</HI> and the Serjeant-Major to <HI>Croy.</HI> There were above twelve hundred men for a Reserve in the close way, commanded by the General of Batta∣lia <HI>Thungen,</HI> under twelve Captains, twelve Lieutenants, and other inferior Officers, with all the Lieutenant-Collonels, and Ser∣jeant-Majors to succeed in the Places of those that should be
<PB N="37" REF="21"/>kill'd or wounded. Which twelve hundred Musqueteers were to advance in little Bodies in the Lines as the others gained ground. The rest of the Infantry stood to their Arms ready to fight, and the Generals in the Trenches.</P>
<P>In this Order, the Soldiers full of Courage and Gallantry, went to the Assault, and mounted the Breaches, where they sound great Resistance, especially at the great Roundel, where the As∣cent to the Breach was high, and the Defendants numerous and well resolv'd. Ours were two or three times repulsed, yet every time renewing the Assault, at length they made themselves ma∣sters of the Breach, and made good their Posts. The <HI>Branden∣burghers</HI> got Possession of the little Wall, among whom were fifty <HI>Heydukes</HI> that behaved themselves very well. The Fight lasted from five till nine at Night, with great Effusion of Blood, not so much by the Enemies Weapons as by their Mines, and the Powder which they had strew'd in several places, to which they still set Fire as they were driven from their Posts. There could be nothing more lamentable than to see between two or three hundred men at a time blown up into the Air by the force of their Mines, who were partly killed, and partly desperately wounded. Yet for all this the Enemy could not terrify our men, nor by their obstinate Resistance prevent 'em from lodging upon the Roundels, and upon the Curtin. There was no great good done by the <HI>Heydukes</HI> that were with the Imperialists, for they were greatly afraid of Fire, and that Fear discourag'd 'em from making the false Attack toward the Water Side. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Count <HI>de Starenbergh,</HI> stood near the grand Master of the Teutonic Order, with their Swords in their Hands, en∣couraging the Officers and Soldiers to do their Duty. The Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> stood in the middle near the Curtin, where he was wounded.</P>
<P>Night parting the Combat, they finished their Lodgments with two Lines of Communication of the Approaches to the Roundels possessed; and they put the Miners to Work at the Wall or En∣trenchment within, where the <HI>Turks</HI> fortified themselves. We cannot sufficiently applaud the martial Valour of the Generals, Officers and Soldiers that were in this piece of Service, who were almost all wounded, in sight of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> whose Ad∣jutant General, the <HI>Steur d' Artein,</HI> was slain as he was carrying Orders. The number of the Slain was not very great, but that of the wounded extraordinary; among whom were the Prince of
<PB N="38" REF="22"/><HI>Croy,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> General <HI>Diependale,</HI> General <HI>Thun∣gen,</HI> the Baron of <HI>Asti,</HI> who notwitstanding he was wounded but two days before, would needs signalize himself in this Action, where he received a second wound, the Serjeant-Major of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aren∣bergh,</HI> two Captains of the same Regiment, the Baron of <HI>Redere,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> Serjeant Major <HI>Pini,</HI> Count <HI>Schlick,</HI> Baron <HI>Gera,</HI> and several other Captains; Lieutenants, and other inferior Officers. On the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> side, Count <HI>Donaw,</HI> Colonel of Foot, was Slain, as also the <HI>Sieur Marwitz,</HI> Serjeant-major, and the Prince of <HI>Curland</HI> grievously wounded; with several others.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, the Elector had ordered the Onset in this manner. The Palisado's upon the Breach-being burnt the day before by forty selected Soldiers, his Electoral Highness command∣ed a Lieutenant with twenty Fuseleers, a Serjeant with six Vo∣lunteers and ten Granadeers, a Corporal with six Carpenters, to cut the Pallisado's: A hundred Musqueteers under a Captain and two Lieutenants, had Orders to Post themselves at the Enemies Pallisado's, and to Fire continually, the better to secure the Work∣men to make a Lodgment upon the Roundel, among which there were twenty five with Shovels and Pickaxes, and seventy five with Hatchets under a Captain; all which were guarded by a Leiute∣nant-Collonel, a Serjeant-Major; and a Captain, with fifty men arm'd with Half-pikes, Halberds and Partisans, a Lieutenant with thirty Granadeers, and two hundred Musqueteers under two Captains and two Lieutenants. This Order being observed as well upon the right Hand as upon the left, the two adjoyning Re∣doubts were finished with thirty Arquebusiers each, and three Bat∣talions of Imperialists, <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> were to second the Assailants. The Cannoneers and Bombardeers had order to Fire from all the Batteries, and to throw Bombs and Carcasses, with∣out intermission, into the Castle, and between the two first Walls towards the Water-side.</P>
<P>All things thus ordered, they advanced through the Overtures toward the Breach (tho very high and difficult to ascend) on the right and left Hand of the Roundel, as also of the Curtin, and with that Fury, that they made themselves masters of the Post, and drave away the Enemy, notwithstanding their continual firing their Muskets, and a showre of Stones, which they threw from the Windows of the Castle. They also made themselves masters of the <HI>Swinger,</HI> which is a great space of Ground in form of a Retreating
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>Place, between the Wall and the Houses. But this place being commanded by the higher Walls, from which the Enemy did much endamage our men with their Granadoes, Stones, and Bombs, his Electoral Highness caused those that had the possessi∣on of it to retire, thinking it sufficient to secure their Lodgments upon the Roundel and the Wall of the Castle, with a Line of Communication from the Gate of the Bridge to the <HI>Swinger-Gate;</HI> to the end they might have the Bridge in their own power; to which purpose they also raised transverse Lines, and two Redoubts. His Electoral Highness shewed himself all the while on the first Posts, encouraging his men with his presence. All the Generals signalized their Courage by striving to outvie one another, as did also the Officers, Volunteers and Soldiers, who fought with all the bravery that could be expected from men of Courage. The <HI>Turks</HI> who defended the Castle and <HI>Swinger,</HI> were for the most part kill'd and wounded, only some few that saved themselves by flight. There were found eight pieces of Cannon, and two Mortar Pieces, which were made use of to batter the second Wall, or the Enemies Parapet within the City. In this Assault of the <HI>Bavurians</HI> were killed two Lieutenants of the Regiment of <HI>Baden,</HI> and five Cap∣tains, one Lieutenant, and three Ensigns wounded. Of the Re∣giment of <HI>Beck,</HI> the Baron of <HI>Welsbergh,</HI> Lieutenant Collonel, five Captains, three Lieutenants, and five Ensigns wounded. Of the Regiment of <HI>Aspremont,</HI> the Collonel, Lieutenant Collonel, Count <HI>Nicholas Palfi,</HI> Serjeant Major Count <HI>Zacco,</HI> seven Cap∣tains, five Lieutenants, and two Ensigns wounded, and one En∣sign killed. Of the Regiment of <HI>Furstenbergh,</HI> one Captain, one Lieutenant, and one Ensign wounded. In the Elector's Regi∣ment of Guards, one Captain killed, the Serjeant-Major, one Captain and three Lieutenants wounded. In the Regiment of <HI>Steinau,</HI> the Serjeant-Major and one Lieutenant slain, one Cap∣tain, two Lieutenants, and one Ensign wounded. In the Regi∣ment of <HI>Rummel,</HI> one Captain, and one Lieutenant killed; three Captains and one Ensign wounded. In the Regiment of <HI>Seibolstorfe,</HI> the Serjeant Major slain, one Captain and two Lieutenants wounded. In the Regiment of <HI>Gallenfels,</HI> the Lieutenant Collonel killed, two Captains and one Lieutenant wounded. The Generals, <HI>La Vergne, Rummel</HI> and <HI>Asprement,</HI> are in the number of the wounded; as also the Duke of <HI>Escalona,</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain;</HI> and some other Volunteers of note: In all, what with Officers, what with common Soldiers, One hundred
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>and seventeen killed, and Nine hundred seventy two wounded. In the <HI>Saxon</HI> Regiments, there was one Lieutenant Collonel, and some Inferiour Officers killed, one Lieutenant Collonel, two Ser∣jeant-Majors, two Captains, one Captain Lieutenant, three En∣signs, two Serjeants, and two Corporals wounded: which, toge∣ther with the common Soldiers, made up seventy slain, and One hundred ninety nine wounded: So that the number of the slain and wounded in all the three Attacks, during this vigorous onset, somewhat exceeds three thousand.</P>
<P>The 28. There was nothing done in all the three Attacks, their time being spent in burying the dead, and securing their Lodg∣ments upon the breaches. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> also caused three Mines to be opened under the second Wall in three several parts, which was also done in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> At∣tack.</P>
<P>The 29. About seven in the morning three Mines were sprung under the second Wall, with such success, that they made a nota∣ble breach in it, and filled up one part of the Trench. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> also advanced on the right hand of the Roundel, and made themselves Masters of two Mortar Pieces, which they turn'd upon the besieged. The same day the great Cannon were planted nearer to the Town, with a resolution to batter the inside of the City with a hundred Pieces of Cannon, and forty Mortar Pieces, if the <HI>Turks</HI> persisted in their Obstinacy: who nevertheless went on with their Ditches and Intrenchments behind the Wall with great diligence. And now the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> finding that almost all the Generals of the Foot were wounded, and not in a condition to do Service, ordered for the future that two Generals of the Caval∣ry should do Duty in the Approaches; <HI>viz.</HI> the Count of <HI>Stirum,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Lodron.</HI> Whereupon the former mounted the Trenches this evening with Lieutenant General <HI>Souches,</HI> and was Relieved the next day by the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, and the Count of <HI>Lodron.</HI></P>
<P>The 30. A Battery of three Demi-Cannons, and another of four Mortar Pieces, were finished upon the Curtin; and great diligence was used to perfect several Mines, to the end they might be ready for springing the next day. Certain <HI>Rascians</HI> having made their escape out of the Town, reported, That though the besieged had resolved to defend themselves to the last; yet that they began to falter in their Resolutions, and to cry out, That it was but reasonable to prevent the farther effusion of blood. Up∣on
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>which a Council of War was held, and after a short Consul∣tation, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sent a second Summons to the Go∣vernour to Surrender, while there was yet a Door of Mercy o∣pen, and that he might do it upon honourable Terms; which if he refused, he would not be answerable for the blood that should be spilt, if the Place should be carried by Assault, for that the Soldiers would spare neither Age nor Sex. <HI>Abdi Bassa</HI> kindly received his Highness's Letter, and desired a day to consult with the Officers of his Garrison, which was granted him; and so there was a suspension of Arms. The Deserters that left the Town in great numbers, assured us, that in the last Assault, meer∣ly in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, the <HI>Turks</HI> had three hundred men kill'd, and seven hundred wounded. We had Intelligence this evening, that four thousand Turkish Horse were seen four Leagues from the Camp, being sent to discover the Condition of the Place; but that being afraid of being surpriz'd, they retreated as suddainly.</P>
<P>The 31. About nine of the clock in the morning the Count of <HI>Lamberg,</HI> Adjutant General, was commanded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to go with an Interpreter and receive the Governour's Answer; which was to this effect: <HI>That he neither could nor would so easily surrender the City which was the Key of the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Em∣pire; but that if he would make a general Peace, they would sur∣render into our hands some other Town equivalen.</HI> In the afternoon the Enemy desired a Cessation of Arms in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, and sent two <HI>Aga's</HI> in Hostage to his Electoral Highness, who sent in their place the Baron of <HI>Creux,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of <HI>Baden,</HI> with an Interpreter. The <HI>Turks</HI> received him with great Ceremony, and all the Civilities imaginable. However, he was not conducted to the <HI>Basha,</HI> but into another House, the Streets as he passed along being lined with Soldiers in Arms, and in very good order, though not many in number: So soon as he came into the House, he was presented with Rice, a roasted Pullet, and little Pasties, with Coffee and Wine. The <HI>Basha</HI> Governour sent his Excuse, <HI>That he could not speak with him as yet, until he had consulted the other Captains of the Garrison, what Propositions to make him.</HI> In which Interval se∣veral Turkish Officers came to visit the Baron. Half an hour after, the Governour sent word, <HI>That he would take it for a kind∣ness if he would be pleased to come over to his House;</HI> which the Baron agreed to; and went accompanied with a great number of
<PB N="42" REF="24"/><HI>Turks,</HI> of which the two chiefest took him under the Arm, and so led him before the <HI>Basha,</HI> who was in a Lodging of Wood over against his House, very well adorned, and spread with rich Tapestries; at which time having caused a Seat to be set for the Baron, he told him, <HI>That he look'd upon himself to be very un∣fortunate to be in such a Place, which had been several times be∣sieged without success, and now happened to be so long abandoned without Relief. On the other side, that he was so earnestly prest by the Emperour's Son-in-Law, and the Grand Vizier, that he wished he were able to give his Resolution touching the Surrender of the Place; but that being an Affair of great Importance, and as much as his Life was worth, it was impossible for him to resolve upon Surrender:</HI> adding withal, <HI>That if they would require any other Place in</HI> Hungary, <HI>it should be delivered into the Emperour's hands.</HI> To which the Baron answered, <HI>That he had no Commission to dis∣course of Conditions, but to know of the</HI> Basha <HI>himself, whether he would surrender or no: That it behov'd him to consider that our men were already Masters of the City: That it would be too late to Ca∣pitulate if he stay'd till another Assault, when it would not be in the power of the Generals to repress the fury of the Soldiers, nor to prevent this Siege from being no less Tragical than that of</HI> New∣hausel. To which the <HI>Basha</HI> made no other Answer, but only shrugged up his shoulders, remaining mute like one that had been Thunder-strook: But as the Baron was going about to depart, he desird him to go along with him into his Cabinet, whither ha∣ving called the <HI>Musti,</HI> and three other <HI>Turks</HI> of the most consi∣derable Quality, he declared to him moreover, <HI>That he could not by any means do the Grand Signior so great a prejudice as to sur∣render a Place upon which depended two hundred Leagues of Coun∣try, and which was the Key of</HI> Turky; <HI>and then offered again any other City of</HI> Hungary <HI>with its Appendances and Dependencies:</HI> yet at length protesting farther, <HI>That if he would give him any Assu∣rances of a general Peace with the Port, that he would then re∣solve to surrender the City of</HI> Buda. But the Baron, who had no Commission to treat, took leave of the <HI>Basha,</HI> only telling him, <HI>That he would communicate, both to the Elector and the Duke of</HI> Lorrain, <HI>the Declaration which he had made: but that he could not assure him that things would be so concluded.</HI> The <HI>Basha</HI> desired him to publish his Declaration through the Camp in writing, and desired to be reconducted to the place where he was first me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; which was done with a great deal of Ceremony, being accompa∣nied
<PB N="43" REF="24"/>by several of the Turkish Officers to the Gate. But it was Imposible either for the Baron or the Interpreter to express the waste which our Bombs have made in the City, where they have ruined the greatest part of the Buildings. The Truce there∣fore that had been observed during this Inter-parley, was broken off yesterday in the evening, at what time the great Guns began again to play with greater fury than before.</P>
<P>This day about Noon the Besieged sprang a small Counter-Mine to ruin our Mine made under their Battery opposite to the great Roundel, but without any Execution. Two days after we sprang two of our Mines, which were made to fill up the Tren∣ches, which succeeded very well: but in the afternoon Count <HI>Sta∣renbergh,</HI> looking out between two Gabions, was unfortunately wounded with a Musquet-shot in his right Thumb, the Cheek and Shoulder, but not dangerously: however he presently caused his Thumb to be cut off, because the Bone was broken. About twen∣ty or thirty were this day wounded in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Branden∣burghers</HI> Attack.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 1. A Battery was finished upon the Roundel, upon which were planted two pieces of Cannon. In the Morning was sprung the third Mine, near the said Roundel, but tho' it suc∣ceeded well, yet there was no other Attempt made, because the Trench was not sufficiently fill'd; whereupon a Resolution was taken to fill it up with Faggots, sacks of Earth, and such like Materials. Our Miners Yesterday smelt such a noysom Stench in one of their Mines that they were scarce able to abide at their Work, till they had remov'd two Bodys that were half dead. About Noon we received intelligence that seven thou∣sand Turks were posted at <HI>Sexaritwan,</HI> thirteen Leagues from <HI>Bu∣da,</HI> and that the Grand Vizier had begun to pass the Bridg of <HI>Es∣seck</HI> with an Army which he had form'd out of the Garisons of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and places adjoyning, and other Campanies got toge∣ther by force, among which were seven thousand men drawn out of <HI>Bossina;</HI> and that of eight thousand Janisaries which the Grand Vizier had brought from the middle of <HI>Turkie,</HI> three thousand had deserted him in his March; that nevertheless he hoped to be at the Head of fifty thousand men, for the Relief of <HI>Buda.</HI> General <HI>Dunewald</HI> return'd this Evening with the Regiments of Horse, with which he had been scouting toward the Bridge of <HI>Esseck,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain Intelligence of the Enemy. The Generals <HI>Caraffa</HI> and <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> arrived also from <HI>Zolnock,</HI> after two days March, with
<PB N="44" REF="25"/>five thousand Horse, and some Hungarian Companies. The next day Count <HI>Budiani</HI> arrived with two thousand <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngarians;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> sent express Orders to General <HI>Scherffen∣bergh</HI> to joyn him with his Body of ten thousand Men. About this time his most serene Highness the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> had had some two or three Fits of an Ague: However he failed not to appear every day in the Trenches, and to give all necessary Orders for the carrying on the Siege: To which purpose great Preparations were made for a second Onset upon the second Wall. This Morning the <HI>Bavarians</HI> beat down a great part of the Wall with their Cannon, and by the springing of a Mine; and made them∣selves Masters of the second Swinger, where they also seized upon the Cannons and Mortar Pieces of the Enemy, which they turned upon the City.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 2. They continued filling up the Trench; and every thing was ready for an Assault, which was delay'd by reason of the continual Rains that fell. Upon repeated Advice of the Ap∣proach of the Grand Vizier, who, as our Scouts assured us, had pass'd the Bridge of <HI>Esseck,</HI> all necessary Preparations were made to receive the Enemy, in case they attempted to relieve the Town.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 3. A Deserter, who affirm'd himself to be a Dome∣stic Servant to one of the most considerable Officers in the City, surrendered himself, and declared that the Besieged had a Mine ready to spring in the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> Attack, and had begun a second: That they impatiently expected Relief: And that of all those whom the Bassa had sent abroad, not one was returned into the City, which very much perplexed him; and that the number of serviceable Soldiers still exceeded two thousand, be∣sides the Inhabitants. The Miners could not finish the grand Mine, by reason of a Rock which they met with. But upon the Breaches certain little Banks were made, to the end the Soldiers might fire with greater Advantage upon the Besieged during the Assault, which was ordered after the following manner. About Noon the Trenches were reliev'd, and they that were relieved were to serve as a Reserve. The first Attack was on the right Hand of the Roundel, to which were appointed fifty Granadeers under a Captain, a Lieutenant, and a Serjeant, followed by twenty men that carryed great store of Granado's. They were followed by fifty Fuseleers, under a Captain, a Lieutenant, and a Serjeant; and after them march'd fifty men with Hatchets. The
<PB N="45" REF="25"/>same Order was observed by the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> on the left Hand. To the third Attack of the midle Curtain, the <HI>Hun∣garians</HI> were assign'd, preceded by thirty <HI>Germans,</HI> and followed by sixty, with necessary Officers. The Onset began between five and six in the Evening, in the Presence of all the Generals, the grand Master of the Teutonic Order commanding the Trench. They forbore to make any false Attack, because the Mine had not done that Execution that was expected. But the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being informed by an Adjutant that the Elector of <HI>Ba∣varia</HI> had absolutely begun the Assault, commanded that the false Attack should be chang'd into a formal Onset. The Com∣bat lasted two hours, in which three hundred Horsemen that serv'd on foot, behav'd themselves with great valour, as did also the <HI>Hungarians.</HI> But the Breach being hard to mount, the be∣sieged well defended with Palisadoes, and fighting like men in despair, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> would not hazard more men to maintain the inner Breach, where our men had lodged themselves already, and therefore sounded a Retreat, contenting himself with making a Lodgment on the right hand of the Roundel of the Angle, where forty men entrenched themselves forthwith. We had few men kill'd by the Enemies firing, but about two hun∣dred wounded with Stones and Arrows, which flew like Hail about the Assailants Ears. Count <HI>Leopold</HI> of <HI>Herberstein,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel to <HI>Souches,</HI> was dangerously wounded; the Sieur <HI>Bischop∣shausen,</HI> Serjeant-Major in the Regiments of <HI>Suabia,</HI> carrying his Arm in a Scarf by reason of a former wound, was again wound∣ed in the hand. Nor were the <HI>Bavarians</HI> in their Attack less pe∣ster'd with Stones and Arrows, and the Splinters of Bombs which the Enemy rowl'd down upon the Planks out of the windows of the Castle, though to little purpose, so that the loss on that side was not very considerable. The Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> was wounded in the hand with an Arrow, together with three Captains, some inferiour Officers, seven or eight Volunteers, and ninety Soldiers killed and wounded. Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> going in the morn∣ing to visit the Approaches, received a Musquet-shot, which burnt his <HI>Justocore,</HI> and very much bruised his Breast, but the strength of his Armour preserved him from death.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> the 4th. They fired with a redoubled Force from all three Attacks to enlarge the Breaches and ruin the Enemies De∣fences. The Line of Circumvallation was also finished, and strengthned with several Redoubts and small Forts to flank their
<PB N="46" REF="26"/>Works. The <HI>Imperialists, Bavarians,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> were also ordered to possess themselves of all the higher Grounds, where they might entrench to advantage. The <HI>Heydukes</HI> were posted all along the inner Wall of the low Town, and thus they continued their Attacks with the same vigour as before. The <HI>Ba∣varians</HI> raised a Battery of nine Pieces of four and twenty pound Ball upon the Roundel of the Castle, with which they battered the Flanks, and widen'd the Breach; for in regard the Ground is very narrow, the Enemy had the more advantage to dispute the Entrance of our Men. This day our Scouts brought Intelli∣gence to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had actual∣ly passed the Bridge of <HI>Esseck,</HI> and that he had twenty thousand fighting men about his Person, which, with the Forces that lay near <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> would make between forty and fifty thousand men, for the most part <HI>Veteranes</HI> drawn out of the Garrisons of Cities and Fortresses; in whose room he had put his new Levies and forc'd Men. We had also Intelligence the same day, that the <HI>Basha</HI> of <HI>Agria,</HI> having drawn together about a thousand <HI>Turks</HI> out of the Garrisons of <HI>Ʋpper Hungary,</HI> was come to <HI>Hat∣wan,</HI> where he had commanded a great number of Waggons to be laden with Ferry-boats, to be carried to the <HI>Danaw,</HI> by the means of which he designed to put in a Reinforcement into <HI>Bu∣da,</HI> at the same time that the <HI>Vizier</HI> assail'd our Lines on the o∣ther side. Upon which Intelligence all precautions imaginable were used to prevent the Designs of the Enemy, and secure the River on <HI>Pest</HI> side.</P>
<P>The 5th of <HI>August,</HI> in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack they carried on their Approaches of the great Roundel toward the second Wall, where they had lodged themselves after the last Assault. The Miners were also set to work under the grand Roundel on the right hand of the Breach, to enable us to attack the Enemy in Flank: and in two other parts on the left hand under the Curtin, to blow up the Entrenchments of the Besieged behind the Breach. The same day they began to build a Gallery, to give a Passage to the inner Trench; and the better to secure the Attack, Pali∣sadoes were fixed to the Flanks of our Works. This night the Besieged did nothing but throw Bombs, Granadoes, and Stones to disturb our Workmen; but all the hurt they did, was the kil∣ling of three <HI>Heydukes,</HI> and wounding six or seven other Soldiers, In the Afternoon one of their Bombs lighted upon a Barrel of Powder, upon one of the Batteries, which kill'd five, and woun∣ded three of our Men.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="26"/>
<P><HI>The sixth of August.</HI> A new Battery of two Demy Cannons was raised in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, behind the great Roundel, by means of which the Defence of the little Roundel was ruined, which had done us great Mischief. They also continued filling up the inner Trench with Bavins, Barrels, Sacks of Earth, and the like. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> vigurously continued their Approaches; but nothing else considerable passed this day.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 7. Last Night we had several false Alarums, as if the Turks had been at hand to attempt the Relief of the Town; which caused us to labor hard in deepning the Trenches round about the Lines, and fortifying the Posts, to discourage the Enemy from any design to force our Camp. The Miners also were hard at work to get the Mines ready within the next three or four days. The <HI>Heydukes</HI> undertook in twenty four hours time to fill up the Trench of the second Wall, for a Reward of four thousand Florins, which was promised them by the Generals. And now the Breach in the second Wall was very much en∣larged, which made the Generals resolve upon a second Assault, so soon as the Mines should be ready. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack they met with great Difficulty to make themselves Masters of the Castle, by reason of the several Walls and Defences which they had to force, and the obstinate Opposition of the Besieged, which made the Elector resolve to redouble his Cannon Batteries. And indeed they did nothing else but batter the Castle with several Batterles; which play'd upon the Flanks and Curtins, that it could not be expected they should stand long. This day his E∣lectoral Highness having sent abroad a Party of thirty <HI>Hussars,</HI> to gain Intelligence of the Enemy, they met an equal Party of the Turks, whom they pursued for two whole Hours together; but the Enemy was so swift of Heel, that they could only kill one, and take four Prisoners whom they brought to the Camp. A∣mong these Prisoners there was an Aga, that four Years ago had been releas'd out of <HI>Raab</HI> for a Ransom of eight thousand Crowns. These Prisoners declared that the Seralquier would be at <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> with twenty six thousand Horse, and would be followed by the Grand Vizier who was randevouzing his Army near the bridg of <HI>Esseck,</HI> which would not be inferior to that which we brought last year to the Siege of <HI>Gran.</HI> They added likewise that the Serasquier had Orders not to engage in a Battle with the Christians, for fear of losing the City of <HI>Buda</HI> and the Army both at once; only that he should endeavor to put in a
<PB N="48" REF="27"/>Reinforcement of Men into the Town, upon peril of his Life.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 8. In the Morning four thousand Turks and Tartars, Horse, shew'd themselves upon a high rising Ground, just against the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarter, and then retreated after some slight Skir∣mishes with Count <HI>Budiani's Hussars,</HI> reinforced with some Com∣manded Troops and Volunteers. The Prisoners then taken de∣posed that the <HI>Serasquier</HI> lay encamped under the Cannon of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> with twenty thousand fighting Men, where he expected the Grand Vizier with the Body of the Army. But by the Re∣lations of our Spies and Courriers, we were inform'd that the Grand Vizier wavered whether he should pass any farther with the whole Army, or whether he should stay at the Bridge of <HI>Es∣seck</HI> with the greatest part of his Forces, to make head against the <HI>Croats,</HI> who might ruin the Bridge if he forsook it, and by that means cut off his Retreat. However it were, to prevent the worst, we continued fortifying our Camp, and playing with our Cannon and Mortar Pieces against the City.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 9. Some thousands of Turks posted themselves some Leagues from our Camp in a very advantageous place, as if they intended to make some Attempt, but we were every way provi∣ded for their Coming: Besides that the Souldiers were very Cou∣ragious, and wished for nothing so much as to come to Blows with the Enemy. However because the Enemy gave us such frequent Alarums, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> ordered that all the Foot that was not in the Approaches, should be disposed of within the Lines, and particularly in the Spurs of the Fortification. This Morn∣ing a Bomb from the Besieged unfortunately lighting upon a Re∣serve of our Granado's, set fire to it, and killed three, and wound∣ed thirteen of our Men. This Evening some of the Turks shewed themselves again upon the right Hand, behind the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Camp. Toward which two Squadrons of the Enemy advanced to outbrave our Men; but some of our Volunteers sallying forth with a Resolution to encounter them, they retreated with the loss only of one Man slain.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 10. They wrought hard to finish the third Mine in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, the other two Mines being now ready to play. His Highness caused the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Infantry to be posted all a∣long the Wall of the low Town; from the water-Roundel to the <HI>German</HI> Quarters, where they secured themselves with a deep Trench and a good Parapet: And because the <HI>Danaw</HI> is very deep thereabout, two Barks filled with Stones were ordered to be
<PB N="49" REF="27"/>sunk, and several Palisado'd Spurs were rais'd all along the bank of the River, to discourage the Enemy from designing any Re∣lief that way. This morning the Enemy gave us another Alarm in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarter: whereupon all our Cavalry were com∣manded to horse; but the Enemy retreated at the same time. It seems their design was to have forced a Passage that way; but the <HI>Bavarians</HI> were too well entrenched for them to succeed in their Enterprize. The Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> being cured of his wounds, re-entred upon the Duty of his Employment, and appeared a∣gain in the Approaches. Four <HI>Hussars</HI> very well mounted, ad∣vancing toward some <HI>Turks</HI> of the Garrison, made a shew as if they intended to have charg'd 'em, but when they drew near, they talked lovingly together, and shook hands: which being ob∣served by some of the Musqueteers in the Redoubt adjoyning, they went forth and fired upon the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssars,</HI> who betook themselves to their heels; but one was wounded and taken Prisoner, toge∣ther with another of his Companions, the third escaped, and the fourth got into the Town. The Prisoners examined, declared that they only expostulated with the <HI>Turks</HI> about their holding out; but then they were put off to a more strict Examina∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 11. Some Troops of the Enemy shewed themselves up∣on the Hill next to the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarters, toward the Road to <HI>Alba Regalis.</HI> As yet we could not learn the exact number of the Enemy, though our Spies assured us that they were forty thousand <HI>Turks,</HI> and twenty thousand <HI>Tartars.</HI> But notwith∣standing all these hot Alarms, being so well fitted to receive 'em as we were, all things were at the same time preparing for a vi∣gorous Assault of the second Wall, if the Mines did that execu∣tion as was expected.</P>
<P>The 12th. In the morning all things being ready for an On∣set, three Mines were sprung in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, which did no other Execution, than only overthrew some Palisadoes. For the Miners had not digged deep enough under the Wall of the second Rampart; which made it apparent that they did not un∣derstand their Trade, though the best were sought out and sent for from several Parts, the Generals knowing that nothing would contribute more to the Reduction of this Place than well ordered Mines. Thereupon the Assault which was determined to have been given, had the Mines succeeded, was delay'd, and the Miners were again set to work to make new ones. In the
<PB N="50" REF="28"/>Skirmishes which our Men had this Day with the Enemy, there was a <HI>Turkish</HI> Officer slain, who was no doubt obliged to have got into the Town. For there were Letters found about him, for the Governour of <HI>Buda,</HI> discovering the Method which the Enemy intended to observe, for the relief of the Town, which was to force one Quarter, and put Relief into the Town, without ha∣zarding a Battle; and that eight Thousand <HI>Tartars</HI> were to range the Country, as far as <HI>Gran,</HI> and cut off Provision from our Men, and infest the Country with continual Inroads Upon which Intelligence, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> called a Council of War. Whereupon it was resolved to leave a part of the Army to guard the Posts against the City, and to issue forth out of the Lines with the rest of the Imperial, and Auxiliary Forces, and go and meet the Enemy, who, as those Letters seemed to intimate, was above sixty Thousand Strong. Though the more Ju∣dicious would not allow 'em to be above forty Thousand Fighting Men.</P>
<P>The 13th. All the Army march'd out of the Lines, except twenty thousand men that were left for the guard of our Works, and to hinder the Enemy from putting a Recruit into the Place. Com∣missary-General <HI>Rabata</HI> caus'd a distribution of Oats and Hay for the Horses for three days: And besides we made a shift to form a very noble Body of Volunteers under good Officers. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> posted himself in view of the Enemy, four thousand <HI>Hussars</HI> and <HI>Heydukes</HI> keeping the Van-guard. Never∣theless the Town was no less vigorously batter'd and assail'd than before. This Evening our Spies and some Deserters as∣sur'd us that the night following the Enemy would put them∣selves in Battle-Array, to Attack us the next morning by break of day, which oblig'd the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to dispose all things in readiness for a Battel.</P>
<P>The 14th. Before Sun rise the Enemy had drawn out a Body of eight thousand Men, part Janisaries, part Spahi's, of the stoutest and most resolute Soldiers in the Army, which being divided into divers lesser Bodies, march'd from six till eight a Clock in the Morning, turning and winding to and again be∣hind the Mountains towards <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and entred into a Plain, designing to approach our Camp under the shelter of a great Valley. But the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having observ'd this contrivance of the Enemy, and understanding their design, com∣manded Count <HI>Dunewald,</HI> General of the Cavalry, to possess
<PB N="51" REF="28"/>himself of the ground on the left hand, with nine Imperial Re∣giments, Cuirassiers, Dragoons, and Croats, <HI>viz. Caprara</HI>'s, <HI>Pal∣fy's, Taff's, Lodron's, Neuburgh's, Furstenbergh's, Stirum's, Serau's,</HI> and <HI>Schultz's;</HI> to which he added some <HI>Hussars;</HI> and General <HI>Heusler</HI> had orders to post himself with his detachment upon a rising ground on the right hand. The <HI>Hussars</HI> next to General <HI>Dunewald</HI> were they that received the first Charge, and although they fought with all the bravery imaginable, they were never∣theless forced to give ground; but finding themselves seconded by the <HI>Germans,</HI> they return'd to the Charge. The <HI>Turks</HI> having thus made the <HI>Hussars</HI> give ground, thought they should have a cheap bargain of the rest. To which purpose they advanced with great fury, and loud outcries, against our Men, who recei∣ved them without moving a foot: General <HI>Heusler,</HI> who had the upper ground, charged them vigorously; so that the Com∣bat was obstinate and bloody: for though the Enemies saw themselves attack'd in Flank and Front, they did their utmost to cut their way through, till at length they were put into dis∣order, separated, and constrain'd to fly: The slaughter that followed was very great; and it was a very pleasant sight to see the Janisaries drop here and there, who being abandon'd by the Spahi's, and environ'd by ours, threw down their Arms and shifted every one for themselves. They were pursu'd into the Plain; nor would it serve their Turn, to throw themselves among the Bushes to shelter themselves from death; for they were Massacred like Wild Beasts that fall into the Hunters Net. The <HI>Turks</HI> had three Thousand Men killed upon the Spot, the most part <HI>Janisaries,</HI> and all choice Men, who had undertaken to force a Quarter, and get into the City, or to perish; and to whom the Grand Vizier had given five Ducats a Head of Twenty, which he promised to every one that should enter the City. They car∣ried almost every one of them three Granadoes apiece, a Pickaxe. and a Shovel, to break down our Entrenchments, and fill up the Trenches. The number of the Wounded was very considerable; but there were not above five Hundred taken Prisoners. There were taken thirty Colours and Ensigns, and eleven pieces of Cannon, and ten Waggons laden with Ammunition.</P>
<P>All which cost us but little Blood; we not having above sixty Slain; among which were the Count of <HI>Lodron,</HI> General <HI>Lodron</HI>'s Brother, <HI>Caprara's</HI> Serjeant <HI>Major,</HI> and one of <HI>Dunewald</HI>'s Cap∣tains: Of the number of the Wounded were two Captains, and thirty three Soldiers.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="29"/>
<P>This Fight thus over to our Advantage, the Enemy made several Motions, and ranged themselves in a Plain that looks to∣ward the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarter, and posting their Wings-upon the rising Grounds, made a Shew as if they intended either to come to a Battel, or relieve the Place with all their Forces. There∣upon a Council of War, wherein it was resolved to pursue the Enemy, which was undertaken by the Elector of <HI>Bava∣ria,</HI> at the Head of his Army: but the shortness of the time would not permit him to draw up his Men in a formal Array: so that the <HI>Turks</HI> doubtful of his design, retired. The two Generals, <HI>Dunewald,</HI> and <HI>Heusler,</HI> pursued the E∣nemy beyond the Hills; and the <HI>Hussars</HI> also had a Rencounter with a considerable Party of the <HI>Turks</HI> that stayed behind to favour the Retreat of the Army. Several Colours and Standards likewise were found scattered along the Fields, which the Fugitives had thrown away, the better to make their Escape. After this Victory, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> commanded some Companies to beat the little Woods and Bushes adjoining, where they found several <HI>Turks,</HI> who were all put to the Sword. For they had all the Spoil of the Enemy; among whom there was hardly one that had not the five Duckets which the Grand Vizier had given him, besides his other Mony. The besieged believing themselves already reliev'd, fired continual∣ly upon those that guarded the Approaches, and thought to have ruin'd some of our Works; but in vain, for they were still so briskly receiv'd, that they had no Maw to hazard skirmish∣ing any more. However they made one furious Sally upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, which prov'd very fatal to 'em, for they were not only repulsed by the Regiments of <HI>Baden,</HI> and <HI>Asprem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t,</HI> but their retreat being cut off, there was a great Slaughter made of them. And now the Enemy being retired without daring to come to any decision of the dispute, the Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI> drew all his Army within the Lines again, and dispatched away the young Count <HI>Palsi,</HI> Captain in Count <HI>Palsi</HI>'s Regi∣ment, to carry the News to the Emperor, and to lay at his Feet twenty eight Colours and Standards won from the Enemy du∣ring the fight. The rest were set up upon the great Roundel, to let the besieged understand the defeat of their Succours, which they expected with so much impatience.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="29"/>
<P>The 15th. The <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Hungariaus</HI> that were upon the Scout, brought several Prisoners to the Camp which they found in the Woods: they assured us, that though the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had received this Repulse, he would not fail to make other At∣tempts to succour the Town, though he lost his whole Army by Piecemeals: and in truth, though the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army were a little retreated, yet they fail'd not to Alarm our Camp every night. This afternoon, order was given by the Generals to hang out a Signal, for a Parley by an Interpreter, to let them under∣stand by the <HI>Janisaries,</HI> who were Prisoners, the Defeat of their Succours: but whether the Besieged perceived it, or no; they returned their Answer by the Mouths of their great Guns and Musquets, with which they broke the Staff of a Turkish En∣sign planted upon the great Roundel.</P>
<P>The 16th. They carried on vigorously the Works of the three Attacks, and in the morning set fire to the Palisadoes and the Defences which the Besieged had made upon the Breaches of the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, notwithstanding all the diligence of the Enemy to quench it: On the other side, while these things were a doing, the Enemy threw down a most dreadful quantity of Stones, Gra∣nadoes, Powder-bags, and other artificial Fire-works, upon our men; so that four of those that set fire to the Palisadoes were kill'd and burnt. A Recompence of twelve Crowns was given to every Soldier engaged in that Action. But in regard the Onset could not yet be given, the Enemy had leisure to fix new Pa∣lisadoes, and repair their Defences in the night. On the <HI>Bava∣rian</HI> side they incessantly battered the Castle and the great Tower, which by this time were ready to tumble, through the force of the Battery.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 17. All things were ready for an Assault betimes in the morning, but the Enemy having repaired their Defences, and put double Palisadoes behind those that were burnt the day be∣fore, we were constrained to desist. The Prisoners which our <HI>Hussars</HI> brought to the Camp, report that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was extreamly enraged against the Commander of the <HI>Spahi</HI>'s, for not having done his Duty, in forsaking the <HI>Janisaries:</HI> to which they added, That of ten thousand that were employed in the Attempt, very few were return'd to the Camp.</P>
<P>The 18th. Two great Mines were sprung in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> At∣tack; but neither did that Execution which our Miners expect∣ed, which much retarded the Reduction of the Place. There∣upon
<PB N="54" REF="30"/>the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> finding so little progress made by the Miners, was resolved upon the <HI>Sapp;</HI> and to that effect great Preparations were made of Bavins, Sacks of Earth, and the like, to fill up the Trench; and certain Engins were likewise contriv'd to approach the Enemy with less danger, and to drive them from their Posts. There was also a new Battery raised to cut off the Palisadoes of the Besieged with chained Bullets. This day a Deserter came from the Turkish Army, who informed us that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was encamped at <HI>Ertschin,</HI> four Leagues from our Camp; but that however he had not given over his design of succouring the Besieged; and that he Retreated only for want of Forrage. This day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> also seized a Country-man, who had swam cross the <HI>Danaw,</HI> with Letters from the Gover∣nour of <HI>Buda</HI> for the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> wherein he conjured him by the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> to Relieve him; adding, that he would hold out to the last Extremity.</P>
<P>The 19th. The Enemy being thus resolved to hold out to the last gasp, fired all the day long with their Artillery upon the new Battery raised in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, to beat down the Pa∣lisadoes fixed upon the Breaches, upon which were planted four Pieces of Canon, and made it unserviceable; so that we were forced to stay till night before we could repair it. The De∣tachments of the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Army alarm'd us every night; so that for the greater security of our Camp, we had always some Regiments upon the Guard, to prevent the Desings of the Ene∣my, and to be ready upon all Occasions. Moreover, it was ve∣rily thought that so soon as General <HI>Scherffenbergh</HI> should arrive in the Camp with his Body of men out of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> where he had garrison'd some Castles, that the Duke would attack the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> in his Camp, who, by the Report of all the Prisoners and Deserters, was not above six and forty thousand men, of which the one half were forc'd and undisciplin'd Men. In the mean time he was very vigilant to send out considerable Parties to observe the Motion of the Enemy, who every foot meeting with the Turks, gain'd every day some remarkable Advantage over 'em.</P>
<P>The 20th. The Grand Vizier desirous once more to try to put Relief into <HI>Buda,</HI> resolved to attempt with a lesser Body than before, that he might not be so easily discovered, and might approach our Camp before we had notice of it. To this pur∣pose he made choice of the stoutest Officers of his Army, who
<PB N="55" REF="30"/>promised to obey his Commands, or perish in the Attempt. These Men set forward in the Night time with two thousand <HI>Spahi's,</HI> and an equal number of <HI>Janiseries</HI> for the more speed. And this morning by break of day they appeared in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Valley. Where having put themselves in order without being perceived, they came thundring upon our Out-Guards with loud Cries and terrible Yelling, and having easily forc'd them, fell upon two Squadrons of <HI>Caprara</HI>'s and <HI>Heusler</HI>'s Cavalrie, who received 'em briskly, and gave opportunity to others to come to their Assist∣ance and repel the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who fled as fast as their Horses Heels could carry them. The <HI>Janisaries</HI> also, some of whom were already alighted, with an Intention to break through our Lines and get into the City, were very coursely entertain'd, be∣ing pursu'd by General <HI>Heusler</HI> to the very Gate, and met by the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Horse-Guard, who came running in upon the Ala∣rum; so that the Slaughter of the Enemy was very great, and very few had the good Luck to enter the City. For tho' some will have them to be a hundred and fifty, hardly a hundred had that good Fortune, which it was easy to judg by the Horses that were quitted, which exceeded not the same number, and besides a good part of them were wounded too by the Musket shot of our Souldiers in the Approaches, by which there was a necessity for 'em to pass. And indeed had the Out-Guards done their Duty, not a <HI>Turk</HI> had passed our Lines. The Enemy had above four hundred slain; and of our Men there were about fifteen slain, and twenty seven wounded. General <HI>Heusler,</HI> who behaved him∣self with an extraordinary Gallantry, received a Wound in the Foot, but not dangerous; but General <HI>Maigret</HI> was very much cut and mangled with a Scirnitar. The Marquess <HI>Santini,</HI> Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> and Captain in <HI>Salleburgh</HI>'s Regiment, was taken Pri∣soner in the first Onset. And now the Besieged to testify their Joy for the Relief they had received, hung out three red Colours in sign of Victory, and fir'd three Rounds of all their great and small Shot. During the Combat some Squadrons of Horse of the Grand Vizier's Army, who had followed the rest, to second them if Occasion were, shew'd themselves in Battel Array to the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, making a shew as if they intended to try their Fortune on that side, but they retired without enterprizing any thing. But at ten a Clock at Night they returned again to the same place where they had attempted to break through in the Morning; but were repulsed by our Men, and retired in Confu∣sion.
<PB N="56" REF="31"/>Within the Lines, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> raised a new Battery of four pieces of Cannon in their Attack, and the Besieged planted a whole Cannon upon the high Wall of the Castle, with which they battered all the Covert way, as also the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Battery upon the great Roundel.</P>
<P>The 21st. This Morning a Redoubt was raised in that part which the <HI>Turks</HI> forced the day before, planted with two pieces of Cannon, and strengthened with a sufficient Force to defend the Pas∣sage. Another Redoubt was also raised upon the Hill upon the left hand, where <HI>Lodron</HI>'s Regiment encamped. This day the Be∣sieged fired some Rounds of great Guns in token of Joy, tho' we could not guess the reason, unless it were for the Celebration of some Festival. This day also the Sieur <HI>Rummel,</HI> General of the <HI>Ba∣varian</HI> Forces, being in the Approaches, was killed with a Mus∣ket Shot. He was very much lamented, as being an Officer who all along had given most signal Proofs of his martial Va∣lor, and fought distinguished upon all Occasions, where he might win Honour.</P>
<P>The 22d. This Morning the Elector caused an Assault to be given to the great Tower, which is in the middle of the Castle, and which our Artillery had for the most part ruin'd; and made himself Master of it after an hours Dispute, which cost us the loss of seventy three men, and as many wounded, among whom was Duke <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Saxon-Mersbergh.</HI> During this Assault there was a false Alarum given in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack to divert the E∣nemy; and the great Guns fired with great Fury upon the De∣fences which the Enemy had raised upon the Breaches of the in∣ner Wall. This Evening about ten a Clock a <HI>Turk</HI> was appre∣hended, who having got out of the Town by swimming the Ri∣ver, travelled all along the Banks of the <HI>Danaw;</HI> and was got as far as St. <HI>Margetts</HI> Island, where being perceived, he threw his Letters into the River, but nevertheless confessed that he was dis∣patched by the Governor to inform the Grand Vizier of the Condition of the Place, and to press Relief: Adding withal that there was another got out upon the same Errand.</P>
<P>The 23d. The Besieged made an Attempt to recover the great Tower of the Castle, which the <HI>Elector</HI>'s Forces had won the day before; but they were repulsed, and pursued to their In∣trenchments. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack four pieces of Cannon were planted upon the old great Battery, with which they began to batter the new Palisadoes upon the Breach of the inner Wall.
<PB N="57" REF="31"/>Last night the Besieged made a Salley upon the <HI>Saxons</HI> Quarter but were so smartly received and repulsed by Lieutenant Co∣lonel <HI>Pletze,</HI> who was upon the Guard with a hundred Horse, that they had much ado to regain their second Wall, where this Officer was slain with two Musquet-shots, the one in his side, and the other in his head.</P>
<P>The 24th. This morning the <HI>Turks</HI> shewed themselves in two distinct Bodies, one upon the <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the other next the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarters, but without making any attempt they Retreated about Noon to their Camp, which they had removed about a League nearer to ours than it was before. This day a Deserter assured us, that the Besieged began to talk with a great deal of liberty against the Governour, who nevertheless endeavoured all he could to retain them in their Duty; assuring them that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> daily expected in his Camp one of the chief Ministers at the <HI>Port,</HI> called <HI>Michtakis,</HI> with full power from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to treat and conclude a Peace with the Generals of the Christian Army: and that upon his arrival there would be a suspension of Arms; exhorting 'em not to degenerate at last from the Gallantry and Vertue of true <HI>Mussel-men,</HI> whose Honour they had hitherto so generously maintained, and to tarry a few days longer, before they talk'd of a Surrender.</P>
<P>The 25. The D. of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being inform'd the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> might find a Passage on the side of the <HI>Danaw,</HI> behind the hot Bathes, to put a Re-inforcement into the City, ordered that there should be every night some Squadrons of Horse ready to second the Guards, which should be likewise doubled; and to render the Passage more difficult for the <HI>Turks</HI> to force, he caused Palisa∣does to be fixed in the weaker and most defenceless places, and caused certain <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Squadrons and Battalions to be there posted, in such a manner, that if the <HI>Turks</HI> should make any attempt elsewhere, they might still be ready with Re∣lief whereever the Alarm called. There was also some alteration made in two Batteries, the better to endamage the Besieged, and overturn their Parapets, Palisadoes, and other Defences, which they had raised upon the Breach of the inner Wall. The <HI>Ba∣varians</HI> were forced to win their ground inch by inch, nor could they as yet make themselves Masters of the whole Castle; such was the Opposition of a stout and daring Enemy, who did not lose a foot of Ground, but what he sought to regain by several Efforts, making use to that purpose of Bombs, Granadoes, Stones, Powder-bags, and all those other means that Courage
<PB N="58" REF="32"/>or Despair were capable to invent to the Destruction of the As∣sailants. Insomuch that it cost no small labour, as fast as we gained Ground, to fill up the Holes and Caverns which the Ene∣my had hollow'd in the Earth for our ruin; which had it not been done, we had never kept our Stations.</P>
<P>The 26th. The Prisoners which our Parties brought to the Camp, as well as some Deserters gave us Information, that one of the Mes∣sengers which the Governour had sent to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> was safely arriv'd at the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Camp, and had deliver'd him the Governor's Letters, wherein he gave him an account of the Condi∣tion of the place, that he could not hold out much longer; that the Christians were Masters of the Castle, and that the next As∣sault would surely carry the Place; that at the last Assault of the Castle he had lost above an hundred of his best Soldiers; that the last Re-inforcement was very inconsiderable, as not amounting to two hundred men, of which the one half were wounded and unfit for Service; that for his part he had done his duty, in let∣ting the Christians know by a Defence so obstinate, during so long a Siege, carried on with so much fury and bravery on both sides, that the <HI>Mussel-men</HI> knew how to defend their <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Glo∣ry, of which he claimed to have merited the Honour: Protest∣ing at length that it lay at the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s door to give an account for the ill Success of the Siege, and that he was only to be responsable for the loss so considerable, which could not be avoided, if the <HI>Imperialists</HI> attempted one more Assault; as also for the Blood of his valiant Soldiers, and his own, if he any longer delayed Relief. In the same Letter the Governour de∣scribed to the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> the Place most proper for him to at∣tempt, which was so little dreamt of, that if he ordered his Bu∣siness as he ought to do, he could not fail in his Enterprize. Up∣on which Intelligence the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> visited himself the Place mark'd out by the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> to make the Attempt, and put all things in order to prevent the Enemies Design. The Spies which were sent to the Enemies Camp, reported, That the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had promised forty Crowns apiece to those that would undertake to put themselves into the Town, promising moreover, that during their Lives, they should be exempt from going to the Wars, and yet should enjoy their usual Pay constant∣ly without doing any duty. About Noon we had Intelligence that the Enemy advanced with twelve Pieces of Canon, and presently after they appeared within view of our Camp, drawn up in Bat∣tel Array: However no sooner had the Duke Marshal'd our Ar∣my
<PB N="59" REF="32"/>in a Condition ready to oppose 'em, but they retreated again.</P>
<P>The 27th. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack was finished a certain piece of Workmanship like a Bridge, which was to be run along up∣on Wheels to the Enemies Palisado's in the time of the Onset: It was covered with Earth to prevent firing, as the day before they had fired some Wooden-works of the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> which constrain'd 'em to recoil; but this Morning they recovered their former Posts, and to guard themselves from the Fire, made use of Planks covered with Tin: But when they thought themselves safe from that devouting Element, the Enemy no less industrious to destroy than they to preserve, flung down in the Evening such an infinite Quantity of Pitch, Tar, Sulphur, and other combustible Materials, with that Success, that the Fire got to the Planks, and reduc'd 'em to Ashes. At the same time they also cast down such an infinite Quantity of Granado's, Stones, and Arrows up∣on the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> that they were constrain'd a second time to quit their Posts with the loss of twenty Soldiers.</P>
<P>The 28th. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack they did nothing but bat∣ter the Flanks of the great Breach, as did also the <HI>Brandenburgh∣ers,</HI> to overturn the Defences of the Enemy. So that at length the <HI>Bavarians</HI> recovered their Post, and secured it so well that it was not in the power of the Enemy to dislodge 'em any more. Serjeant Major <HI>Stuben,</HI> of the Regiment of <HI>Sebolstorff,</HI> who com∣manded the Assailants, was slain, with some common Soldiers; tho' both slain and wounded, did not exceed the number of twenty. Upon the Report of some Deserters, that the grand Vizier was re∣solv'd this night to attack us with all his Forces, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> prepared all things in a Readiness to receive him, and all the Army stood to their Armes in Battalia; but to no pur∣pose, for no Enemy appeared.</P>
<P>The 29th. Being the Day of St. <HI>John</HI>'s beheading, which the <HI>Turks,</HI> out of a foolish piece of Superstition, have always look'd up∣on as a day auspicious to their Empire, a thousand <HI>Spahi</HI>'s, and two thousand <HI>Janisaries,</HI> under the command of two <HI>Basha</HI>'s, and seconded by fifteen hundred <HI>Tartars,</HI> came to try their Fortune on that side next the Water, but finding those Posts too well provided, and having been saluted with a volley of small Shot, they retired in great hast, and thought it more proper to try to break through in that part where the last Reinforcement had for∣ced their way. In short an hour after they appeared in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Valley, and with terrible Outcries and Yells came thundring up∣on the Horse Regiments of <HI>Mercy, Heusler,</HI> and <HI>Neuburgh,</HI> who re∣ceiv'd
<PB N="60" REF="33"/>'em with that Gallantry, that they slew a great number of those <HI>Barbarians,</HI> of whom some were so fool-hardy as to throw themselves into our Lines, where they were all cut to pieces, except 4. who were so fortunate as to get into the Town. We reckoned a∣bove 600. <HI>Turks</HI> that were slain in this Action, besides the Pri∣soners, which are not very many. There were also taken 25. Co∣lors of Horse and Foot, all Red, to signifie that they would either enter the Town or dye. On our side there were not above 30. slain and wounded, among which latter was General <HI>Mercy,</HI> having receiv'd two Cuts with a Scimitar, one in the Head, and the other in the Shoulder, tho' nothing dangerous; but his Adjutant-Gene∣ral was slain. During the heat of this Action, the Besieged made a Sally upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack; but the <HI>Heydukes</HI> assailing 'em in Flanck, they had much ado to retire with the loss of 17. killed upon the Place. All this day the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> shewed himself on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarters, ready to try the Fortune of a Battle, but perceiving the Arrival of General <HI>Picolomini</HI> in our Camp, with three Regiments of Cuirassiers, and two of Dragoons, being the Vanguard of General <HI>Scherffenbergh</HI>'s Body, he retreated in great hast to his Camp.</P>
<P>The 30th. General <HI>Picolomini</HI> arriving yesterday with the Re∣giments of <HI>Saxon Lawenburgh, Picolomini,</HI> St. <HI>Croix, Tettwin,</HI> and <HI>Magni,</HI> making in all 25. Squadrons, was this day followed by Lieu∣tenant-General <HI>Scherffenbergh</HI> with the rest of his Body, compo∣sed of the Foot Regiments of <HI>Veterani, Getz, Sereni, Spinola,</HI> and <HI>Scherffenberg,</HI> all lusty proper Men, and well disciplin'd. The Deserters also assur'd us that there was a great Scarcity in the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Army, and that the Souldiers half starved, had pil∣laged certain Barks that brought Provisions for <HI>Buda,</HI> their Officers not being able to prevent it. The 31th. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attacque a new Post was taken in the Trench before the Breach of the Inner Wall, which is not above three Fadom distance from the Palisa∣do's of the Besieged; and in regard the place was very deep, the <HI>Turks</HI> could not annoy us; so that we had not above two men wounded. This Morning the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> accompany'd with all the rest of the Generals, went over to the Elector's Quarters, where he held a Council of War, and after Dinner the Duke re∣turn'd to his own Quarters, where he order'd the Works to be enlarg'd and deepn'd, that they might with less difficulty go on to the General Affault, which was then intended within a day or two.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 1. The <HI>Turks</HI> shewed themselves before day by the light of
<PB N="61" REF="33"/>the Moon near the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, to the number of 3000 Horse and Foot; but perceiving our men to be in good order, and ready to receive 'em, they retired without making any attempt. Ye∣sterday the Grand Chancellor, the Count <HI>de Straatman,</HI> being ar∣rived at the Camp, with a private Commission from the Emperor, he caused a Council of War to be call'd, where were present the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and all the Generals, both Imperialists and Auxiliaries. The Chancellor then produ∣ced his Commission, to this effect; That his Imperial Majesty earnestly desiring an end of that bloody Siege, they were to con∣sult the most proper and expedient means to do it. Thereupon two Points were proposed; Whether to fight the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> with the greatest part of the Army, leaving a sufficient Force to guard the Lines; or, whether to give a general Assault to the Place with a greater Force than had yet been made use of to that purpose. Which latter Proposal was concluded upon by the great∣est part of the Generals, and so a general Assault being concluded upon the next day, all things were prepared in a readiness, that the Blow might not fail; and to keep the Enemy in ignorance, a Rumor was spread abroad in the Camp, That the next day the General intended to give the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> Battel, which caused great re∣joycing among the Officers and Soldiers, who desired nothing more than to signalize their Valour. Nevertheless they forbore not to play all the day long from all the Batteries to widen the Breaches, and beat down the Enemies Defences.</P>
<P>The 2d. All the Generals got on Horseback, and the Army was drawn up ready to quit the Lines, and march to the grand Pa∣rade, from thence to march toward the <HI>Grand Vizier.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and the Elector visited every Quarter, encouraging the Officers and Soldiers valiantly to maintain the Cause of God and the Emperor's Honour. In the mean time the Infantry rang'd themselves in their several Battalions, the great Guns were fired with re-doubled Fury from all the three Attacks, and an infinite number of Bombs and chain'd Shot were thundred against the De∣fences of the Besieged. But when the Army was just ready to march toward the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> of a suddain the whole order of the March was chang'd, and about three a Clock in the after∣noon the Rean-Guard was commanded to mount the Breaches, all things being so provided before hand, that without disturbing the Order of the Battalions, they might fall on. Which they did in three several Places; <HI>viz.</HI> In the <HI>Lorrain, Bavarian,</HI> and <HI>Bran∣denburghers</HI> Attacks: besides other false Attacks premeditated to
<PB N="62" REF="34"/>divert the Enemy: But notwithstanding all these Precautions to render the Assault more easie, such was the obstinate Resistance, that they had much ado to prevail. They defended themselves a∣bove three quarters of an hour with their Halbards, Half-pikes, and Partisans, and slung such an infinite quantity of Stones, Arrows and Granadoes, that they repulsed us vigorously more than once: but at length our men, encouraged by the Presence of their Ge∣nerals, returned to the Assault with greater Fury, and made themselves Masters of the Breaches in all the three Attacks. The <HI>Turks</HI> defended themselves, retreating from Entrenchment to En∣trenchment, so that the slaughter was very bloody: for our Soldi∣ers having driven the <HI>Turks</HI> from their Defences, entred the City by main force, over-run the Streets, put all to the Sword that en∣countred their Fury, sparing neither Sex nor Age, so that there was nothing else to be seen but the dead Bodies of the slain. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> also pursued their Advantage, and fell upon a thousand <HI>Turks</HI> who were retired to a little Fort at the Foot of the Castle, where they defended themselves to the utmost, till at length despairing of their Safety, they hung out a white Flag, and begg'd for Quarter. Which, considering their obstinacy, and the slaugh∣ter they had made of our men, the Duke and the Elector were at first unwilling to grant; but recollecting afterwards that their num∣ber was great, that they might do us more mischief, that Night drew on; that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was at hand with a Formidable Army, that the Soldiers were tired and wanted repose, and that the City was on Fire in several places, they resolv'd to give them their Lives; of which when these miserable Creatures were assu∣red, they flung down their Arms and yielded at discretion. There were about a thousand <HI>Turks</HI> more, who being retired into Caves and Caverns, obtained the same favour. The number of the Bar∣barians that were slain, amounted to above 3000. besides the wound∣ed, which were not many: so that it appears the Garrison was much str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger than the Deserters reported. The Governour <HI>Basha</HI> dy'd bravely upon the the Breach, where he defended himself va∣liantly with his Scimiter in his hand, scorning to Retreat or de∣mand Quarter, that he might not degenerate from the Honour and Heroic Vertue of the ancient <HI>Mussel men,</HI> nor falsifie the Oath which he had made the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> either to preserve the Town, or gloriously to end his days. The <HI>Vice Basha,</HI> being an Of∣ficer of high Reputation, defended the Castle, but perceiving all was lost, retir'd fighting into the fore-mentioned Fort at the foot of the Castle, which he thought to make good, and give the <HI>Grand Visier</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="34"/>leisure to relieve him; but seeing the desperate condition of Af∣fairs, he rather chose to implore the clemency of the Victors, than to occasion the Massacre of those that were about him, and so was taken Prisoner with the rest by the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and presented to his Electoral Highness. The <HI>Aga</HI> of the Janisaries taken by the Im∣perialists, was delivered up to the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> with some o∣ther Turkish Officers of note. So that the number of the Prison∣ers did not much exceed 2000. Men, of 13000. at the beginning of the Siege, all stout and experienc'd Soldiers, and the very si∣news of the Militia of all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. The loss on our side was very small, compar'd with that of the Enemies. For we cannot reckon above 400. kill'd, and about 200. wounded, among whom were several Volunteers, but very few Officers, Colonel <HI>Spinola,</HI> Marquess of <HI>Arquato,</HI> an Officer of great merit, receiv'd his death's wound at the head of the Assailants; &amp; the Ba∣ron of <HI>Asti,</HI> who had been twice wounded before, during the Siege, receiv'd a third wound more dangerous than any of the former, to the great hazard of his life. The booty which the Soldiers got was extraordinary, there being a vast deal of Wealth in the City, which the Inhabitants of other Cities and Places under the domi∣nion of the <HI>Turk</HI> had brought thither for Security, as being a place which they thought impregnable. There was found in the Town, Ammunition and Provision sufficient for a Siege of two Months longer; a Magazine furnish'd with all sorts of Arms Of∣fensive and Defensive for above 30000. Men, Harness for Horses, Saddles, Boots, and other Equipage for the Cavalry; and besides all this near 400. Pieces of Cannon, and Mortar Pieces, of which 170. were never the worse, fixed upon their Carriages. It is impossible to give you an Inventory of every thing; 'twill be e∣nough to say, that never any City could be better provided to sustain a vigorous Siege, than this was; or ever was defended by a stouter Garrison. But if the resistance met with, were so surprizing, much more must be the Glory of so many brave Of∣ficers, Volunteers, and Soldiers, that signalized their valour, and eternized, not only their own Memories, but the Honour of the Emperor, in gaining such a strong hold, and recovering it into the Possession of him, to whom it belongs by right of Nature and Succession; and which had endured so many Sieges, before it could be reduced under the Subjection of its Lawful Sovereign.</P>

<PB N="64" REF="35"/>
<P>The D. of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> after he had prevented any farther slaugh∣ter, and given all necessary orders to reduce the Soldiers under their Colours, commanded the People to quench the fire that continu'd burning in several parts, gave the Government of the place to General <HI>Beek,</HI> with a Garrison of 5000. Foot, and 1000. Horse, till his Imperial Majesty should otherwise dispose of the absolute Government of this Imperial City; and command∣ed between 8 and 10000 Cuirassiers and Dragoons, with the <HI>Hussars</HI> under Count <HI>Budiani</HI> to pursue the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> who having look'd on, and seen the taking of <HI>Buda,</HI> decamp'd with his whole Army to secure the rest of the Turkish Fortresses, to reinforce the Garrisons, and gain the Bridge of <HI>Esseck,</HI> where our General is resolv'd to attack him, if he can overtake him in his march. To which purpose the Infantry was embark'd upon the <HI>Danaw,</HI> to make the more hast, while the Cavalry march'd by Land.</P>
<P>Thus was this great and strong City, the Capital City of all <HI>Hungary,</HI> the seat of the Ancient Kings, reduced under the Obe∣dience of our most Illustrious and Invincible Emperour <HI>Leopold</HI> the first, after it had groaned under the Tyrannous Yoke of the <HI>Ottomans</HI> a hundred forty five years, who made use of it as a place of Rendezvous for their Armies, and a Magazine to furnish all the other Cities in those parts under their subjection, with Men and Ammunition, to which purpose they always furnished it with a numerous Garrison, never consisting of less than between 8 and 10000 Janisaries and Spain's, whether in Peace or War. And though Sultan <HI>Solyman</HI> won this important place from King <HI>Fer∣dinand,</HI> Brother to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, in the year 1529. through the treachery of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Garrison; never∣theless he put it into the hand of <HI>John Zapolilia,</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran∣silvania,</HI> who had call'd him to his Assistance to preserve him in the Throne, to which he had been advanc'd by Sedition, and con∣trary to Form, by a part of the Nobility, after the death of King <HI>Lewis</HI> slain at the Battle of <HI>Mohaes,</HI> contrary to the Procla∣mation of the real King <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> duly elected by the four Or∣ders of the States of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Usurper being thus confirm'd in the enjoyment of one part of the Kingdom, and of the Capital City under the Prote∣ction of the <HI>Turks,</HI> King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> sent his General Count <HI>Rog∣gendorff,</HI> who had so valiantly defended <HI>Vienna,</HI> under the Command of the Elector Palatine, against the efforts of <HI>Solyman,</HI> to lay Siege to <HI>Buda;</HI> but he was constrain'd to raise his Siege,
<PB N="65" REF="35"/>after he had lost a great part of his Army. General <HI>Felsius</HI> was sent thither 10. years after. But that Enterprise succeeded no better tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the former; notwithstanding the Death of the Usur∣per <HI>Zapolia,</HI> and the Minority of his Son <HI>John Sigismund,</HI> who was under the Tutelage of the Princess <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> his Mother, and <HI>George Martinusius,</HI> chief Minister of State to his deceased Father. However King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was no way discou∣raged by these two unsuccessful Attempts, but considering the Im∣portance of the Place for the Support of his Crown, resolv'd upon a third Attempt. To which purpose he raised a more numerous Army than before, and gave the Command of it to <HI>Roggendorff,</HI> who the next Year laid a third Siege to <HI>Buda,</HI> and had made himself Master of it, if <HI>Solyman,</HI> at the Sollicitation of the Princess <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> had not hastned to his Relief; which constrained the Gene∣ral to raise his Siege, not being able to make head against such a numerous Army of the Infidels. Thereupon the Sultan politick∣ly seized upon the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> sent the young Prince <HI>John Si∣gismund,</HI> with the Princess his Mother, into <HI>Transilvania,</HI> and kept the Town in his own Hands, with a Resolution never to re∣store it, notwithstanding his public Declaration to keep it only during the Minority of the Prince. And to that intent he filled it with a strong Garrison of his own Men, the choicest in his Army, under the Command of a <HI>Beglerbeg,</HI> or <HI>Vice Roy,</HI> whose Authori∣ty extends over all the <HI>Basha</HI>'s of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was that this Royal City has been ever since in subje∣ction to the <HI>Ottoman Empire.</HI> The Marquess of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> had∣form'd a design upon <HI>Buda</HI> in the Year 1542. but having in vain assaulted the City of <HI>Pest,</HI> which is separated from it only by the <HI>Danaw,</HI> he retreated without making the least Attempt upon the Capital City: So that this Expedition is not to be lookt upon as a Siege, as some would erroneously have it to be. Count <HI>Smarzen∣burgh</HI> besieg'd it in the Year 1598. but was constrain'd to raise his Siege after he had lain thirty days before it, by reason of the con∣tinual Rains when the Year was too far spent. In the Year 1602. General <HI>Roswourm</HI> lay before it with the Imperial Army, and at∣tacqu'd it in vain. Nor was the fatal day for this Place languish∣ingunder the Tyranny of the <HI>Turks,</HI> yet come in the Year 1684. when the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> first attacked it. For God had ordain'd the 2d. of <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1686. (the day when it was taken by <HI>Soly∣man</HI>) to be the day of his Triumph, when it was again wrested from the Hands of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> after this same 7th. Siege had been carried on with that Heat, Constancy, Prudence, and Con∣duct
<PB N="66" REF="36"/>of the Couragious D. of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> assisted by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> no less eminent for all the forementioned Vertues, and several other Generals of the Emperor, and his Auxiliaries, una∣nimously conspiring the Regaining of this Place, that we have reason to hope for Conquests far more Glorious, and more Con∣siderable for the Advancement of the Cause of God, Advance∣ment of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Family, and consolation of so great a num∣ber of Christian Souls as groan'd under the Tyrannous Yoak of Infidels, and the Recovery of an infinite number of <HI>Barbarians</HI> in∣to the Bosom of the true Church of God.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have heretofore experienced the Valour of <HI>Huniades</HI> and <HI>Scanderbergh,</HI> who were the Scourges of those barbarous Peo∣ple: They have trembled at the Courage and Conduct of the D. of <HI>Merceur,</HI> to that degree, that the Grand Signior threaten'd a Rupture with <HI>France,</HI> if the King would not recall him out of the Emperor's Service. They have been apprehensive of the Pro∣gress of the Valiant Count <HI>Serini,</HI> and several other famous Cap∣tains, every where attended by their good Fortune. But much more Reason have they to be astonished at the Heroic Virtues of our undaunted and martial D. of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who seems to have been born for the Subversion of the Mahometan Law, and with whom no Person living can dispute the Honour of being the greatest Captain of his Age, and the Terror of the <HI>Musselmen;</HI> who knows not what it is to lose a Battel, and who may say with the Invin∣cible Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. when he swam cross the <HI>Elb,</HI> vanquish'd and took Prisoner <HI>Frederic</HI> D. of <HI>Saxony,</HI> crying out, <HI>Veni, vidi, Deus vicit.</HI> For in all Encounters whereever he engaged, during this Holy War, he has miraculously triumphed o're his Ene∣mies, and born away the Victory. He it was, who during the Seige of <HI>Vienna,</HI> surpriz'd and overcame near <HI>Presburgh</HI> the Re∣bellious Army of Perfidious <HI>Teckley,</HI> Reinforced with a Body of <HI>Turks</HI> under the Command of <HI>Hussein-Basha.</HI> He it was that de∣feated the <HI>Turks</HI> near <HI>Calenburgh,</HI> and constrain'd the Grand Vi∣zier dishonourably to raise his Siege from before <HI>Vienna.</HI> He it was that vanquished the Enemy near <HI>Barkan,</HI> and rescu'd the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Prince his Son, when they were both in iminent Danger, and the <HI>Polish</HI> Army in Confusion. He it was that during the Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> three times defeated the Serasquier's Army: Who during the Siege of <HI>Newhausel</HI> relieved the City of <HI>Gran,</HI> and routed the Army of <HI>Zeitan Ibraim Bassa.</HI> And lastly, he it was who won this glorious Conquest, while the Grand Vizi∣er <HI>Solyman</HI> looked on with a potent Army of <HI>Barbarians,</HI> twice
<PB N="67" REF="36"/>or thrice beat his Succors, and tho' at length he came up with all his Forces against our Lines, gave a general Assault, and by main Force carried this Important Place, guarded still by above 5000. fighting Men; So that it is deservedly said of him,</P>

<P>The Conquests made in <HI>Turkie</HI> are the price of so many Victo∣ries, and will doubtless be attended with many more by the assi∣stance of the God of Battels, who has hitherto favour'd and bless'd the victorious Arms of our thrice Illustrious Monarch, under the Conduct of so great a Captain, defcended from the Noble Stock of so many Illustrious Hero's, and particularly from the warlike Conqueror of the Holy Land, <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloign,</HI> whose steps he treads so gloriously, that if the Christian Princes would but as∣sist him with their Forces, and act unanimously with him, he might with ease regain the Kingdom of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> his ancient Patrimony, which the Infidels wrested from his Ancestors.</P>
<P>Would it might please Divine Providence that now the time were come to humble the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which according to the Prognostications of the <HI>Turks</HI> themselves, has not long to subsist, it being a Prediction currant among 'em, <HI>That the City of</HI> Constan∣tinople <HI>having been taken by one</HI> Mahomet, <HI>will be re-taken by the Christians under the Raign of another</HI> Mahomet. God grant that this may happen under Him at present, who by the loss of <HI>Buda</HI> has lost the Key of all his Empire.

<L>O're conquer'd Turks the Victory to compleat,</L>
<L>The Christians thrice must Letter <HI>B</HI> repeat.</L>
<L>First <HI>Buda, Belgrade</HI> next, the third Effort</L>
<L><HI>Bysantium</HI>'s Walls, the rest will be but Sport.</L>

<P>That is to say, that before we can gain an absolute Triumph over
<PB N="68" REF="37"/>the <HI>Turks,</HI> and ruin their Empire, the Christians must win the three Principal Cities of their Empire that begin with the Letter <HI>B, Buda, Belgrade,</HI> and <HI>Bysantium;</HI> the rest will come easily. <HI>Buda,</HI> which is the strongest of all these three places, is already taken, as you have heard, and by the Recovery of this Important Place, the Gate is open to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> there being no Fortress upon the <HI>Danaw</HI> able to dispute our Approach; and the advantage of that River will not a little contribute to facilitate an Enterprize of so great Importance to all Christendom. <HI>Bysantium</HI> or <HI>Constantinople</HI> also might be ea∣sily attacked, both by Sea and Land; while the Naval Power of the most Serene Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> re-inforced with the Galleys of the Pope, <HI>Malta, Tuscany,</HI> and others, force the <HI>Dardanels,</HI> and block it up by Sea. The <HI>Polonian</HI> Army also crossing <HI>Bessarabia,</HI> might march as far as the <HI>Pontus Euxinus,</HI> and awe those Countries which for many Ages have not known what War is, nor seen an Enemy. For if a handful of <HI>Cossacks,</HI> that inhabit the Rocks of <HI>Borysthenes,</HI> during the late Wars of <HI>Poland,</HI> have been so coura∣gious as to affront with their small Barks the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> in his <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and alarm <HI>Constantinople</HI> it self, the Capital City of the Empire, and to fire the very Suburbs: what might not such for∣midable Armies of so many Christian Princes be able to do, en∣couraged by so many remarkable Victories which they have ob∣tained over their Enemies, and the famous Conquests they have won under the Conduct of such Renowned Captains, who know nothing else but how to Conquer; especially at a time when the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> and the Grand Duke of <HI>Muscovy</HI> are preparing to make most powerful Diversions in favour of the Christians?</P>
