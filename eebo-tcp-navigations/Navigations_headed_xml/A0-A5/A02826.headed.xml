<HEAD>THE OBSERVATIONS OF S<SUP>IR</SUP> RICHARD HAWKINS, KNIGHT, in his VOYAGE into the South SEA. ANNO DOMINI. 1593.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ITH the COVNSELS consent, and helpe of my Father, Sir <HI>Iohn Hawkins,</HI> Knight, I resolved a Voyage to be made for the Ilands of <HI>Iapan,</HI> of the <HI>Phillippinas,</HI> and <HI>Molueas,</HI> the Kingdomes of <HI>China,</HI> and <HI>East Indies,</HI> by the way of the <HI>Straites</HI> of <HI>Magelan,</HI> and the South Sea.</P>
<P>The principall end of our De∣signements, was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The necessary vse of Disco∣veries.</NOTE> to make a perfect Discovery of all those parts, where I should arriue, as well knowne as vnknowne, with their Longi∣tudes and Latitudes; the lying of their Coasts; their Head-lands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of travaile.</NOTE> their Pons, and Bayes; their Citties, Townes, and Peoplings; their manner of Government; with the Commodities which the Coun∣tries yeelded, and of which they haue want, and are in neces∣sitie.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>For this purpose in the end of Anno 1588. returning from the iourney against the Spanish <HI>Armado,</HI> I caused a Ship to be builded in the river of <HI>Thames,</HI> betwixt three and foure hundred tunnes, which was finished in that perfection as could be required For shee was pleasing to the eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shipping.</NOTE> profitable for Stowage, good of Sayle, and well conditioned.</P>
<P>The day of her Lanching being appoynted, the Lady <HI>Hawkins</HI> (my Mother in Law) craued the naming of the Ship, which was ea∣sily granted her: who knowing what Voyage was pretended to be vndertaken, named her the <HI>Repentance</HI>: what her thoughts were, was kept secret to her selfe; And although many times I expostula∣ted with her, to declare the reason for giving her that vncouth name, I could never haue any other satisfaction, then that repen∣tance was the safest Ship we could sayle in, to purchase the haven of Heaven. Well, I know, shee was no Prophetesse, though a religi∣ous and most vertuous Lady, and of a very good vnderstanding.</P>
<P>Yet too propheticall it fell out by Gods secret Iudgementes, which in his Wisedome was pleased to reveale vnto vs by so vnknowne a way, and was sufficient for the present, to cause me to desist from the Enterprise, and to leaue the Ship to my Father, who willingly tooke her, and paid the entire charge of the building and furnishing of her, which I had concorted or paid. And this I did not for any superstition I haue in names, or for that I thinke them able to further or hinder any thing; for that all immediately dependeth vpon the Providence of Almightie God, and is disposed by him alone.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Improper Names for Shipping.</NOTE>Yet advise I all persons ever (as neere as they can) by all meanes, and in all occasions, to presage vnto themselues the good they can, and in giving names to terrestriall Workes (especially to Ships) not to giue such as meerly represent the celestiall Character; for, few haue I knowne, or seene, come to a good end, which haue had such attributes. As was plainely seene in the <HI>Revenge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Revenge.</NOTE> which was e∣ver the vnfortunatest Ship, the late Queenes Maiestie had during her Raigne; for comming out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with Sir <HI>Iohn Parrot,</HI> shee was like to be cast away vpon the <HI>Kentish</HI> Coast. After in the Voy∣age of Sir <HI>Iohn Hawkins</HI> my Father, Anno 1586. shee strucke a∣ground comming into <HI>Plimouth,</HI> before her going to Sea: Vpon the coast of <HI>Spaine,</HI> shee left her Fleete, readie to sinke with a great Leake: At her returne into the Harbour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> shee beate vpon <HI>Winter stone</HI>; and after in the same Voyage, going out of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> Haven, shee ranne twice a-ground; and in the latter of them, lay twentie two houres beating vpon the shore, and at length
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
with eight foote of water in hold, shee was forced off, and present∣ly ranne vpon the Oose: and was cause, that shee remained there (with other three Ships of her Maiesties) six moneths, till the Spring of the yeare; When comming about to bee decked, en∣tring the river of <HI>Thames,</HI> her old Leake breaking vpon her, had like to haue drowned all those which were in her. In Anno 1591. with a storme of wind and weather, riding at her Moorings in the river of <HI>Rochester,</HI> nothing but her bare Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts over head, shee was turned topse-turvie, her Kele vppermost: And the cost and losse shee wrought, I haue too good cause to remember; in her last Voyage, in which shee was lost, when shee gaue <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spaine</HI> iust cause to remember her. For the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselues confesse, that three of their Ships sunke by her side, and was the death of aboue 1500. of their men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster <HI>Hac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts</HI> Relations.</NOTE> with the losse of a great part of their fleete, by a storme which suddainly tooke them the next day. What <HI>English</HI> died in her, many liuing, are witnesses: A∣mongst which was Sir <HI>Richard Greenfeild,</HI> a noble and valiant Gen∣tleman, Vice-admirall in her of her Maiesties Fleete. So that well considered, shee was even a Ship loaden, and full fraught with ill successe.</P>
<P>The like wee might behold in the <HI>Thunderbolt</HI> of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Thunder∣bolt</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> who in one Voyage (as I remember) had her Mast cleft with a Thun∣derbolt, vpon the Coast of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arbary.</HI> After in <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> going for Admirall of the Whaftage, and guard of the Fleete for the River of <HI>Bourdieux,</HI> had also all her Poope blowne vp with fire sodainly, and vntill this day, never could be knowne the cause, or manner how: And lastly, shee was burned with her whole Companie in the River of <HI>Bourdieux,</HI> and Master <HI>Edward Wilson,</HI> Generall in her, slaine by his enemies, having escaped the fire.</P>
<P>The successe of the <HI>Iesus</HI> of <HI>Lubecke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Iesus</HI> of <HI>Lubeck.</HI></NOTE> in Saint <HI>Iohn de Vlua,</HI> in the <HI>Nona Spania,</HI> infamous to the <HI>Spaniardes</HI>; with my <HI>Repentance</HI> in the South Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Repen∣tance.</HI></NOTE> taken by force, hath vtterly impoverished, and o∣verthrowne our house.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He REPENTANCE being put in perfection, and riding at <HI>Detford,</HI> the Queenes Maiestie passing by her, to her Pallace of <HI>Greenwych,</HI> commanded her Bargemen to Row round about her, and view∣ing her from Post to Stemme, disliked nothing but her Name, and said, that shee would Christen her a new, and that thenceforth shee should be called the <HI>Daintie</HI>; which name shee brooked as well for her proportion and grace, as for the many happie Voyages shee made in her Maiesties services; Having taken (for her Maiestie) a great <HI>Bysten,</HI> of fiue hundred Tunnes, loaden with Iron, and other Commodities, vnder the conduct of Sir <HI>Martin Furbusher</HI>; A <HI>Caracke</HI> bound for the <HI>East In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,</HI> vnder my Fathers charge, and the principall cause of taking the great <HI>Caracke,</HI> brought to <HI>Dartmouth</HI> by Sir <HI>Iohn Borrow,</HI> and the Earle of <HI>Cumberlands</HI> Shippes, Anno 1592. with others of moment in her other Voyages. To vs, shee never brought but cost, trouble, and care. Therefore my Father resolved to sell her, though with some losse, which he imparted with me: and for that I had ever a parti∣cular loue vnto her, and a desire shee should continue ours, I offered to case him of the charge and care of her, and to take her, with all her Furniture at the price he had before taken her of me; with re∣solution, to put in execution the Voyage, for which shee was first builded; Although it lay six moneths and more in suspence, part∣ly, vpon the pretended Voyage for <HI>Nombrededios</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> which then was fresh a foote; and partly, vpon the <HI>Caracke</HI> at <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> in which I was imployed as a Commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sioner: but this Businesse being ended, and the other pretence waxing colde, the fift of March I resolved, and beganne to goe forward with the iour∣ney, so often talked of, and so much desired.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Considerati∣ons for pre∣tended Voya∣ges.</NOTE>And having made an estimate of the charge of Victualls, Muni∣tion, Imprests, Sea-store, and necessaries for the sayd Ship; con∣sorting another of an hundred Tunnes, which I waited for daily from the Straites of <HI>Giberalter,</HI> with a Pynace of sixtie Tunnes, all mine owne: And for a competent number of Men for them; as also of all sorts of Marchandises for trade and traffique in all pla∣ces where wee should come; I began to wage men, to buy all man∣ner of victualls and provisions, and to lade her with them, and with all sorts of Commodities (which I could call to minde) fitting;
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
and dispatched order to my servant in <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to put in a readi∣nesse my Pynace; as also to take vp certaine Provisions, which are better cheape in those parts then in <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Provisions better provi∣ded at <HI>Plim∣mouth,</HI> then at <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> as Beefe, Porke, Bisket, and Sider. And with the diligence I vsed, and my Fathers furthe∣rance, at the end of one Moneth, I was readie to set Sayle for <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to ioyne with the rest of my Shippes and Provisions. But the expecting of the comming of the <HI>Lord high Admirall,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Cecill,</HI> principall Secretary to her Maiestie, and Sir <HI>Walter Rawley,</HI> with others, to honour my Shippe and me, with their presence and farewell, detayned me some dayes; and the rayne and vntem∣perate weather deprived me of the favour, which I was in hope to haue received at their hands; Wherevpon, being loath to loose more time, and the Winde serving according to my wish, the eight of Aprill 1593. I caused the Pilot to set Sayle from <HI>Blackwall,</HI> and to <HI>vayle</HI> downe to <HI>Graues-end,</HI> whether that night I purposed to come.</P>
<P>Having taken my vnhappy last leaue of my Father Sir <HI>Iohn Haw∣kins,</HI> I tooke my Barge, and rowed downe the River, and com∣ming to <HI>Barking,</HI> wee might see my Ship at an Anchor, in the midst of the Channell, where Ships are not wont to more them∣selues: this bred in me some alteration. And comming aboord her, one and other began to recant the perill they had past of losse of Ship and goods, which was not little; for the winde be∣ing at East North-east, when they set sayle, and vered out Sou∣therly; it forced them for the doubling of a point to bring their tacke aboard, and looffing vp; the winde freshing, sodenly the Shipp began to make a little hele; and for that shee was very deepe loaden, and her ports open, the water began to enter in at them; which no bodie having regard vnto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> thinking themselues safe in the River, it augmented in such maner, as the waight of the water began to presse downe the side, more then the winde: At length when it was seene and the shete flowne, shee could hardly be brought vpright. But God was pleased, that with the diligence and travell of the Company, shee was freed of that danger: which may be a gentle warning to all such as take charge of Shipping, even before they set sayle, eyther in River or Har∣bour, or other part, to haue an eye to their ports, and to see those shut and callked, which may cause danger; for avoyding the many mishaps, which dayly chance for the neglect thereof, and haue beene most lamentable spectacles and examples vnto vs: Ex∣periments in the <HI>great Harry,</HI> Admirall of England, which was over-set and suncke at <HI>Ports-mouth</HI> with her Captaine, <HI>Carew,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
and the most part of his company drowned in a goodly Summers day, with a little flawe of winde; for that her ports were all o∣pen, and making a small hele, by them entred their destruction; where if they had beene shut, no wind could haue hurt her, especi∣ally in that place.</P>
<P>In the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> Master <HI>Thomas Candish</HI> had a small Ship over-set through the same negligence. And one of the Fleete of Syr <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> in <HI>Santo Domingo</HI> Harbour, turned her keele vpward likewise, vpon the same occasion; with many others, which wee never haue knowledge of.</P>
<P>And when this commeth to passe, many times negligence is cloaked with the fury of the winde: which is a double fault; for the truth being knowne, others would bee warned to shun the like neglects; for it is a very bad Ship, whose Masts crackt not asun∣der, whose Sayles and tackling flie not in peeces, before shee o∣ver-set; especially if shee be English built. And that which over∣setteth the Ship is the waight of the water, that presseth downe the side, which as it entreth more and more, increaseth the waight, and the impossibilitie of the remedie: For the water not entring, with casing of the sheate, or striking the sayles, or put∣ting the Ship before the winde or Sea, or other diligences, as oc∣casion is offered (and all expert Mariners know) remedie is ea∣sily found.</P>
<P>With this mischaunce the Mariners were so daunted, that they would not proceede with the Ship any further, except shee were lighted, which indeede was needelesse, for many reasons which I gaue: but Mariners are like to a stiffe necked Horse, which taking the bridle betwixt his teeth, forceth his Rider to what him list ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger his will: so they hauing once concluded, and resolved, are with great difficultie brought to yeelde to the raynes of reason: And to colour their negligence, they added cost, trouble, and delay. In fine, seeing no other remedie, I dispat∣ched that night a servant of mine to giue account to my Father of that which had past, and to bring mee presently some Barke of <HI>London</HI> to goe along with mee to <HI>Plymouth</HI>; which not finding, he brought me a Hoye, in which I loaded some sixe or eight tunns, to giue content to the company; and so set sayle the 13. of Aprill, and the next day wee put in at <HI>Harwich,</HI> for that the winde was contrary, and from thence departed the 18. of the sayd Moneth in the morning.</P>
<P>When wee were cleere of the Sands, the winde vered to the South-west, and so we were forced to put into <HI>Margat</HI> Roade, whe∣ther
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
came presently after vs a Fleete of Hollanders of aboue an hundreth Sayle, bound for <HI>Rochell</HI> to loade salt: and in their com∣panie a dozen ships of Warre; their wasters very good ships and well appointed in all respects. All which came alongst by our ship, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ured vs, as is the custome of the Sea, some with three, o∣thers with fiue, others with more peeces of Ordinance.</P>
<P>The next morning the winde vering Easterly, I set sayle, and the Hollanders with me, and they with the flood in hand, went out at the North-sands-head; and I through the <HI>Gulls</HI> to shorten my way, and to set my Pilates shore.</P>
<P>Comming neere the South-sore-land, the winde began to vere to the South-east and by south, so as we could not double the point of the Land, and being close abourd the shore, and putting our ship to slay, what with the chapping Sea, and what with the Tide vpon the Bowe, shee mist staying, and put vs in some daunger, be∣fore wee could flact about;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> therefore for doubling the point of any land better is ever a short bourd, then to put all in perill.</P>
<P>Being tacked about wee thought to anchor in the Downes, but the sayles set, we made a small bourd, and after casting about a∣gaine, doubled the foreland, and ran alongst the Coast till we came to the Ile of <HI>Wight</HI>: where being becalmed wee sent a shore Master <HI>Thomson</HI> of <HI>Harwich</HI> our Pilot, not being able before to set him on shore for the perversnes of the winde.</P>
<P>Being cleere of the <HI>Wight,</HI> the winde vered Southerly, and be∣fore wee came to <HI>Port-land,</HI> to the west, South-west, but with the helpe of the ebbe wee recovered <HI>Port-land</HI> ronde, where we ancho∣red all that night; and the next morning with the ebbe, wee set sayle againe, the winde at west South-west; purposing to beare it vp, all the ebbe, and to stop the flood being vnder sayle.</P>

<P>But some one may say vnto me, that in all occasions it is not con∣venient to giue Directions: for that, if the enemy happen vpon any of the Fleete, or that there be any treacherous person in the com∣pany, their Designements may be discovered, and so prevented.</P>
<P>To this I answere, that the prudent Governour, by good conside∣ration may avoyde this, by publication of that which is good and necessarie for the guide of his Fleete and people; by all secret in∣structions, to giue them sealed, and not to be opened, but comming to a place appoynted, (after the manner of the Turkish direction to the <HI>Bashawes,</HI> who are their Generalls;) and in any eminent perill to cast them by the boord, or otherwise to make away with them.

<P>And for places of meeting, when seperation happeneth, I am of opinion, to appoynt the place of meeting in such a height, twentie, or thirtie, or fortie Leagues off the Land, or Iland.

Which is a bad custome re∣ceived and vsed of many ignorant persons, presently to gun at all whatsoever they discover, before they speake with them; being contrary to all discipline, and many times is cause of dissention betwixt friends, and the breach of Amitie betwixt Princes; the death of many, and sometimes losse of Shippes and all, making many obstinate, if not desperate: whereas in vsing common cour∣tesie, they would better bethinke themselues, and so with ordina∣rie proceeding (iustified by reason, and the custome of all well disci∣plined people) might perhaps many times breede an increase of A∣mitie, a succour to necessity, and excuse divers inconveniencies and sutes, which haue impoverished many: for it hath chanced by this errour, that two English ships, neither carrying flag for their perticular respects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundry mis∣chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es for neglect thereof</NOTE> to change each with other a dozen payre of shott, with hurt to both, being after too late to repent their follie.

<P>Besides there was no losse of reputation, because the French Kings Fleete was in his owne Sea; and therfore for it to come to winde-ward, or the other to goe to lee-ward, was but that, which in reason was required, the Kingdomes being in peace and Ami∣tie: For every Prince is to bee acknowledged and respected in his iurisdiction, and where hee pretendeth it to be his.</P>
<P>The French Generall, likewise seemed well to vnderstand what hee had in hand, for though he were farre superiour in forces, yet vsed hee the termes which were required; and comming within speech hayled them, and asked if there were peace or warre be¦twixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> whereunto answere being made, that they knew of no other but peace; they saluted each other after the maner of the Sea, and then came to an Anchor all together; as and friends visited each other in their ships.</P>
<P>One thing the French suffered (vpon what occasion or ground I know not) that the English alwayes carried their flag displayed; which in all other partes and Kingdomes is not permitted; at least in our Seas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The English carry vp their flagg in the French Seas.</NOTE> if a Stranger Fleete meete with any of his Ma∣iesties ships, the forraigners are bound to take in their flags, or his Maiesties ships to force them to it, though thereof follow the breach of peace or whatsoever discommodity.

Yea, such is the respect to his Maiesties Shippes in all places of his Dominions, that no English Ship displayeth the Flagge in their presence, but run∣neth the like daunger, except they be in his Maiesties service; and then they are in predicament of the Kings Ships. Which good dis∣cipline in other Kingdomes is not in that regard as it ought, but sometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> through ignorance, sometimes of malice, neglect is made of that dutie and acknowledgement which is required, to the cost and shame of the ignorant and malicious.</P>

<P>I being of tender yeares, there came a Fleete of <HI>Spaniards</HI> of aboue fiftie sayle of Shippes, bound for <HI>Flaunders,</HI> to fetch the Queene, <HI>Dona Anna de Austria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And in the passage of <HI>Do∣na Anna de Austria.</HI></NOTE> last wife to <HI>Philip</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econd of <HI>Spaine,</HI> which entred betwixt the Iland and the Maine, without vayling their Top-sayles, or taking in of their Flags: which my Father, Sir <HI>Iohn Hawkins,</HI> (Admirall of a Fleete of her Maiesties Shippes, then ryding in <HI>Catt-water)</HI> perceiving, commanded his Gunner to shoot at the flagge of the Admirall, that they might thereby see their er∣ror: which notwithstanding, they persevered arrogantly to keepe displayed; wherevpon the Gunner at the next shott, lact the Admi∣rall through and through, whereby the <HI>Spaniards</HI> finding that the matter beganne to grow to earnest, tooke in their Flags and Top-sayles, and so ranne to an Anchor.</P>
<P>The Generall presently sent his Boat, with a principall personage to expostulate the cause and reason of that proceeding; But my Fa∣ther would not permit him to come into his Ship, nor to heare his Message: but by another Gentleman commanded him to returne, and to tell his Generall, That in as much as in the Queenes Port and Chamber, he had neglected to doe the acknowledgment and reverence, which all owe vnto her Maiestie, (especially her Ships being present) and comming with so great a Navie, he could not but giue suspition by such proceeding of malicious intention, and therefore required him, that within twelue houres he should depart the Port: vpon paine to be held as a common enemy, and to pro∣ceed against him with force.</P>

The <HI>Spanish</HI> Generall began to demand, if there were Warres betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spaine</HI>; who was answe∣red, that his arrogant manner of proceeding, vsurping the Queene his Mistresses right, as much as in him lay, had given sufficient cause for breach of the Peace; And that he purposed presently, to giue notice thereof to the Queene, and her Counsell; and in the meane time, that he might depart. Wherevnto the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gene∣rall replyed, that he knew not any offence he had committed, and that he would be glad to know, wherein he had mis-behaved him∣selfe. My Father seeing he pretended to escape by ignorance, be∣ganne to put him in mind of the custome of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and many other parts, and that he could by no meanes be ignorant of that, which was common Right to all Princes in their King∣domes; Demanding, if a Fleete of <HI>England</HI> should come into any Port of <HI>Spaine</HI> (the Kings Maiesties Ships being present) if the <HI>English</HI> should carry their Flags in the toppe, whether the <HI>Spanish</HI> would not shoot them downe; and if they persevered, if they would not beate them out of their Port. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Generall confes∣sed his fault, pleaded ignorance, not malice, and submitted him∣selfe to the penaltie my Father would impose: but intreated, that their Princes (through them) might not come to haue any jarre. My Father a while (as though offended) made himselfe hard to be intreated, but in the end, all was shut vp, by his acknowledgement, and the auncient amitie renewed, by feasting each other aboord and ashore.</P>

Out of this Valley ordinarily rise every day, great vapours and exhalations, which by reason that the Sunne is hindered to worke his operation, with the height of the Mountaines towards the South-east, convert themselues into moysture, and so bedewe all the Trees of the Valley, and from those which over-top this Tree, drops downe the dewe vpon his leaues, and so from his leaues into a round Well of Stone, which the Naturals of the land haue made to receiue the water; of which the people and cattle haue great releife: but sometimes it raineth and then the Inha∣bitants doe reserue water for many dayes to come in their Cisterns and Tynaxes, which is that they drinke of, and wherewith they principally sustaine themselues.</P>

<P>Some I haue heard say, and others write, that there is a Starre which never seperateth it selfe from the Moone, but a small di∣stance; which is of all Starres the most beneficiall to man. For where this Starre entreth with the Moone, it maketh voyde her hurtfull enfluence, and where not it is most perilous.

<P>Of these Ilands are two pyles: the one of them lyeth out of the
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>
way of Trade, more Westerly, and so little frequented; the other lyeth some fourescore Leagues from the Mayne, and containeth six in number, to wit; <HI>Saint Iago, Fuego, Mayo, Bonavisto, Sal,</HI> and <HI>Bravo.</HI></P>
<P>They are belonging to the Kingdome of Portingall, and inhabi∣ted by people of that Nation, and are of great trade, by reason of the neighbour-hood they haue with <HI>Guyne</HI> and <HI>Bynne</HI>; but the prin∣cipall is, the buying and selling of <HI>Negros.</HI> They haue store of Su∣gar, Salt, Rice, Cotton-wooll, and Cotton-Cloth, Amber-greece, Cyvit, Oliphants teeth, Brimstone, Pummy stone, Spunge, and some Gold, but little, and that from the mayne.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Iago</HI> is the head Iland, and hath one Citie and two Townes, with their Ports. The Cittie called <HI>Saint Iago,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saint Iago.</HI></NOTE> whereof the Iland hath his Name, hath a Garrison, and two Fortes, scituated in the bottome of a pleasant Valley, with a running streame of water pas∣sing through the middest of it, whether the rest of the Ilands come for Iustice, being the seat of the <HI>Auaiencia,</HI> with his Bishop.</P>
<P>The other Townes are <HI>Playa,</HI> some three Leagues to the East∣wards of <HI>Saint Iago,</HI> placed on high, with a goodly Bay, whereof it hath his name: and Saint <HI>Domingo,</HI> a small Towne within the Land. They are on the Souther part of the Iland, and haue beene sacked sundry times in Anno 1582. by <HI>Manuel Serades,</HI> a <HI>Portingall,</HI> with a Fleete of French-men; in Anno 1585. they were both burnt to the ground by the English, Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> being Generall; and in Anno 1596. <HI>Saint Iago</HI> was taken, and sacked by the Eng∣lish, Sir <HI>Anthony Shyrley</HI> being Generall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacked by <HI>Manuel Sera∣des,</HI> St. <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and Sir <HI>Anthony Shyr∣ley.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The second Iland is <HI>Fuego,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fuego.</HI></NOTE> so called, for that day and night there burneth in it a <HI>Vulcan</HI>; whose flames in the night are seene twentie Leagues off in the Sea. It is by nature fortified in that sort, as but by one way is any accesse, or entrance into it, and there can∣not goe vp aboue two men a brest. The Bread which they spend in these Ilands, is brought from <HI>Portingall</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> saving that which they make of Rice, or of Mayes, which wee call <HI>Guynne</HI>-wheate.</P>
<P>The best watering is in the Ile of <HI>Bravo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bravo.</HI></NOTE> on the west part of the Iland, where is a great River, but foule Anchoring, as is in all these Ilands, for the most part. The fruits are few, but substantiall, as Palmitos, Plantanos, Patatos, and Coco Nutts.</P>
<P>The Palmito is like to the Date tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Palmito.</HI></NOTE> and as I thinke a kinde of it, but wilde. In all parts of <HI>Afrique</HI> and <HI>America</HI> they are found, and in some parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in divers parts different. In <HI>A∣frique,</HI> and in the West <HI>Indies</HI> they are small, that a man may cut
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>
them with a knife, and the lesser the better: But in <HI>Brasill</HI> they are so great, that with difficultie a man can fell them with an Axe, and the greater the better; one foote within the top is profitable, the rest is of no value; and that which is to be eaten is the pith, which in some is better, in some worse.</P>
<P>The Plantane is a tree found in most parts of <HI>Afrique</HI> and <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Plantane.</HI></NOTE> of which two leaues are sufficient to cover a man from top to toe; It beareth fruit but once, and then dryeth away, and out of his roote sprouteth vp others new. In the top of the tree is his fruit, which groweth in a great bunch, in the forme and fashion of pud∣dings, in some more, in some lesse. I haue seene in one bunch aboue foure hundred Plantanes, which haue weighed aboue foure∣score pound waight. They are of divers proportions, some great, some lesser, some round, some square, some triangle, most ordina∣rily of a spanne long, with a thicke skinne, that peeleth easily from the meate; which is either white or yellow, and very tender like Butter; but no Conserue is better, nor of a more pleasing taste. For I never haue seene any man, to whom they haue bred mis-like, or done hurt with eating much of them, as of other fruites.</P>
<P>The best are those which ripen naturally on the tree, but in most partes they cut them off in braunches, and hange them vp in their houses, and eate them as they ripe. For the Birds and Vermine presently in ripning on the tree, are feeding on them. The best that I haue seene are in <HI>Brasill,</HI> in an Iland called <HI>Placentia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Platentia.</HI></NOTE> which are small, and round, and greene when they are ripe▪ whereas the others in ripning become yellow. Those of the West <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>Guynne</HI> are great, and one of them sufficient to satisfie a man; the onely fault they haue is, that they are windie. In some places they eate them in stead of bread, as in <HI>Panama,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Tierra firme.</HI> They grow and prosper best when their rootes are ever co∣vered with water; they are excellent in Conserue, and good sodden in different manners, and dried on the tree, not inferior to Suc∣kett.</P>
<P>The Coco nutt is a fruit of the fashion of a Hassell nutt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cocos,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir kindes.</NOTE> but that it is as bigge as an ordinary Bowle, and some are greater. It hath two shells, the vttermost framed (as it were) of a multitude of threeds, one layd vpon another, with a greene skinne over-lapping them, which is soft and thicke; The innermost is like to the shell of a Hazell nutt in all proportion, saving that it is greater and thicker, and some, more blacker. In the toppe of it is the forme of a Munkies face, with two eyes, his nose and a mouth. It con∣taineth in it both meate and drinke; the meate white as milke,
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>
and like to that of the kernell of a Nutt, and as good as Almonds blancht, and of great quantitie: The water is cleare, as of the foun∣taine, and pleasing in taste, and somewhat answereth that of the water distilled of Milke. Some say it hath a singular propertie in Nature, for conserving the smoothnesse of the skinne; and there∣fore in <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Portingall,</HI> the curious Dames doe ordinarily wash their faces and neckes with it. If the holes of the shell be kept close, they keepe foure or six moneths good, and more; but if it be opened, and the water kept in the shell, in few dayes it turneth to Vineger.</P>
<P>They grow vpon high Trees, which haue no boughes; onely in the top they haue a great cap of leaues, and vnder them groweth the fruite vpon certaine twigs; And some affirme that they beare not fruite, before they be aboue fortie yeares old, they are in all things like to the Palme trees, and grow in many partes of <HI>Asia, Afrique,</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> The shels of these nuts are much esteemed for drinking cups, and much cost and labour is bestowed vpon them in carving, graving and garnishing them, with silver, gold and precious stones.</P>
<P>In the Kingdome of <HI>Chile</HI> and in <HI>Brosill,</HI> is another kinde of these, which they call Coquillos, as wee may interpret (little Co∣cos) and are as big as Wal-nuts; but round and smooth, and grow in great clusters: the trees in forme are all one, and the meate in the nut better, but they haue no water.</P>
<P>Another kinde of great Cocos groweth in the <HI>Andes</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> which haue not the delicate meate nor drinke, which the others haue, but within are full of Almonds, which are placed as the graines in the Pomegrannet, being three times bigger then those of <HI>Europe,</HI> and are much like them in tast.</P>
<P>In these Ilands are Cyvet-Cats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyvet-Catts.</NOTE> which are also found in parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Afrique</HI>; esteemed for the Civet they yeelde, and car∣ry about them in a cod in their hinder parts, which is taken from them by force.</P>
<P>In them also are store of Monkies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Munkeyes.</NOTE> and the best proportioned that I haue seene; and Parrots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parrots.</NOTE> but of colour different to those of the west <HI>Indies</HI>; for they are of a russet or gray colour and great speakers.</P>

Wherevnto they made answere, that all the lynes in our Shippes could not fetch ground: for wee could not be lesse then threescore and tenne Leagues off the Coast, which all that kept reckoning in the Ship agreed vpon, and my selfe was of the same opinion. And so wee applyed our selues to serue God, but all the time that the service endured, my heart could not be at rest, and still me thought the water began to waxe whiter and whiter. Our pray∣ers ended, I commanded a lead and a lyne to be brought, and ha∣ving the lead in foureteene fathoms wee had ground, which put vs all into a maze, and sending men into the toppe, presently discove∣red the land of <HI>Guynne,</HI> some fiue Leagues from vs, very low Land.

The Sea we found to be barren of Fish, and my Boates could not discover any landing place, though

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Ere is to be noted, that the error which we fell into in our accompts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> was such as all men fall into where are currants that set East or West, and are not knowne, for that there is no certaine rule yet practised for triall of the longitude, as there is of the latitude, though some curious and experimented of our Nati∣on, with whom I haue had conference about this poynt, haue shewed me two or three manner of wayes how to know it.</P>
<P>This, some yeares before was the losse of the <HI>Edward Cotton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The losse of the <HI>Edward Cotton.</HI></NOTE> bound for the Coast of <HI>Brasill,</HI> which taken with the winde con∣trary neere the lyne, standing to the East-wards, and making ac∣compt to be fiftie or sixtie Leagues off the Coast, with all her Sayles standing, came suddenly a ground vpon the sholes of <HI>Madre∣bombat</HI>; and so was cast away, though the most part of their compa∣ny saved themselues vpon Raffes; But with the contagion of the Countrie, and bad entreatie which the <HI>Negros</HI> gaue them, they died; so that there returned not to their Country aboue three or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oure of them.</P>
<P>But God Almightie dealt more mercifully with vs in shewing vs our error in the day, and in time, that wee might remedie it; to him be evermore glory for all.</P>
<P>This currant from the line Equinoctiall, to twentie degrees Nor∣therly, hath gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at force, and setteth next of any thing East, directly vpon the shore; which we found by this meanes: Standing to the Westwards, the wind Southerly, when we lay with our Ships head West, and by South, we gayned in our heith more then if wee had made our way good west south-west; for that, the currant tooke vs vnder the bow: but lying west, or west and by north, we lost more in twelue houres then the other way we could get in foure and twentie. By which plainly we saw, that the currant did set East next of any thing. Whether this currant runneth ever one way, or doth alter, and how, we could by no meanes vnderstand, but tract of
<PB N="34" REF="21"/>
time and observation will discover this, as it hath done of many others in sundry Seas.</P>
<P>The currant that setteth betwixt <HI>New-found-land</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> run∣neth also East and West, and long time deceived many, and made some to count the way longer, and others shorter, according as the passage was speedie or slowe; not knowing that the furtherance or hinderance of the currant, was cause of the speeding or slowing of the way. And in sea Cardes I haue seene difference of aboue thirtie Leagues betwixt the Iland <HI>Tercera,</HI> and the Mayne. And others haue recounted vnto me, that comming from the <HI>India's,</HI> and looking out for the Ilands of <HI>Azores,</HI> they haue had sight of <HI>Spaine.</HI> And some haue looked out for <HI>Spaine,</HI> and haue discovered the Ilands.</P>
<P>The selfe same currant is in the <HI>Levant</HI> Sea, but runneth trade be∣twixt the Maynes, and changeable sometimes to the East-wards, sometimes to the West-wards.</P>
<P>In <HI>Brasill</HI> and the <HI>South Sea,</HI> the currant likewise is changeable, but it runneth ever alongst the Coast, accompanying the winde: and it is an infallible rule, that twelue or twentie foure houres (be∣fore the Wind alters) the currant begins to change.</P>
<P>In the West <HI>Indies</HI> onely the currant runneth continually one way, and setteth alongst the Coast from the Equinoctiall lyne to∣wards the North. No man hath yet found that these courrants keepe any certaine time, or run so many dayes, or moneths, one way as another, as doth the course of ebbing and flowing, well knowne in all Seas: onely neere the shore they haue small force; partly, because of the reflux which the coast causeth, and partly for the ebbing and slowing, which more or lesse is generall in most seas.</P>
<P>When the currant runneth North or South, it is easily disco∣vered by augmenting or diminishing the height, but how to know the setting of the currant from East to West in the mayne Sea, is difficult, and as yet, I haue not knowne any man, or read any Au∣thour, that hath prescribed any certaine meane or way to disco∣ver it. But experience teacheth that in the mayne Sea, for the most part it is variable; and therefore the best and safest rule to pre∣vent the danger, (which the vncertainty and ignorance heereof may cause) is carefull and continuall watch by day and night, and vpon the East and west course ever to bee before the shipp, and to vse the meanes possible to know the errour, by the rules which newe Authours may teach: beating off and on, sometimes to the west-wards, sometimes to the East-wards, with a fayre gale of winde.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Eing betwixt three or foure degrees of the Equinocti∣all line, my Company within a fewe dayes began to fall sicke, of a disease which Sea-men are wont to call the Scurvey:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scurvey.</NOTE> and seemeth to bee a kinde of dropsie, and raigneth most in this Climate of any that I haue heard or read of in the World; though in all Seas it is wont to helpe and increase the miserie of man; it possesseth all those of which it taketh hold, with a loathsome sloathfulnesse, <HI>even to eate:</HI> they would be content to change their <HI>sleepe and rest,</HI> which is the most pernicious Enemie in this sicknesse, that is knowne. It bringeth with it a great desire to drinke, and causeth a generall swelling of all parts of the body, especially, of the legs and gums, and many times the teeth fall out of the iawes without paine.</P>
<P>The signes to know this disease in the beginning are divers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The signes.</NOTE> by the swelling of the gummes, by denting of the flesh of the leggs with a mans finger, the pit remayning without filling vp in a good space: Others, show it with their lasinesse, Others, com∣plaine of the cricke of the backe, &amp;c. all which, are for the most part, certaine tokens of infection.</P>
<P>The cause of this sicknes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause.</NOTE> some attribute to sloath; some to conceite; and divers men speake diversly: that which I haue ob∣served is, that our Nation is more subiect vnto it, then any other; because being bred in a temperate Clymate, where the naturall heate restrayned, giveth strength to the stomacke, sustayning it with meates of good nourishment, and that in an wholsome ayre, whereas comming into the hot Countries, (where that naturall heate is dispersed through the whole body, which was wont to be proper to the stomacke; and the meates for the most part, preser∣ved with Salt, and its substance thereby diminished, and many times corrupted) greater force for digestion is now required, then in times past; but the stomacke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inding lesse vertue to doe his office, in reparting to each member his due proportion in perfection, which either giveth it rawe, or remayneth with it indigested by his hardnes or cruditie; infeebleth the body, and maketh it vnlusty and vnfit for any thing, for the stomacke being strong, (though all parts els be weake) there is ever a desire to feede, and aptnes to per∣forme whatsoever can bee required of a man; but though all
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>
other members be strong and sound, if the Stomacke be opprest, or squemish, all the body is vnlustie, and vnfit for any thing, and yeeldeth to nothing so readily, as to sloathfulnes, which is con∣firmed by the common answere to all questions: As, will you eate? will you sleepe? will you walke? will you play? The answere is, I haue no stomacke: which is as much, as to say, no not willing∣ly, thereby confirming that without a sound and whole stomacke, nothing can bee well accomplished, nor any sustenance well di∣gested.</P>
<P>The seething of the meate in Salt water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seething of meat in Salt water.</NOTE> helpeth to cause this in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmitie, which in long Voyages can hardly be avoyded: but if it may be, it is to be shunned; for, the water of the Sea to mans body is very vnwholsome. The corruption of the victuals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corruption of victuall.</NOTE> and especial∣ly of the bread, is very pernicious; the vapours and ayre of the Sea also is nothing profitable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vapours of the Sea.</NOTE> especially, in these hot Countries, where are many calmes. And were it not for the moving of the Sea by the force of windes, tydes, and currants, it would corrupt all the world.</P>
<P>The experience I saw in Anno 1590. lying with a Fleete of her Maiesties ships about the Ilands of the <HI>Azores</HI> almost six moneths;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Azores.</HI></NOTE> the greatest part of the time we were becalmed: with which all the Sea became so replenished with severall sorts of gellyes, and formes of Serpents, Adders, and Snakes, as seemed wonderfull: some greene, some blacke, some yellow, some white, some of divers cou∣lours; and many of them had life, and some there were a yard and halfe, and two yards long; which had I not seene, I could hardly haue beleeved. And hereof are witnesses all the Companies of the Ships which were then present; so that hardly a man could draw a Buckett of water cleere of some corruption. In which Voyage, to∣wards the end thereof, many of every Ship, (saving of the <HI>Non∣pereli,</HI> which was vnder my charge, and had onely one man sicke in all the Voyage) fell sicke of this disease, and began to die apace, but that the speedie passage into our Country was remedie to the crazed, and a Preservatiue for those that were not touched. The best prevention for this disease (in my iudgement) is to keepe cleane the Shippe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The remedies;</NOTE> to be sprinkle her ordinarily with Vineger, or to burne Tarre, and some sweet savours, to feed vpon as few salt Meats in the hot Country as may be, and especially to shunne all kindes of salt Fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By dyet.</NOTE> and to reserue them for the cold Climates, and not to dresse any meat with salt water, nor to suffer the companie to wash their Shirts nor Cloathes in it, nor to sleepe in their Cloaths when they are wett. For this cause it is necessarily required, that
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>
provision be made of apparell for the Company, that they may haue wherewith to shift themselues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">By shift.</NOTE> Being a common calamitie amongst the ordinary sort of Mariners, to spend their thrift on the shore, and to bring to Sea no more Cloaths then they haue backes; for the bodie of man is not refreshed with any thing more, then with shifting cleane Cloaths; a great preservatiue of health in hott Countries.</P>
<P>The second Antidote is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By labour.</NOTE> to keepe the companie occupied in some bodily exercise of worke, of agilitie, of pastimes, of dauncing, of vse of Armes; these helpeth much to banish this infirmitie. Thirdly, In the morning at discharge of the watch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By early ea∣ting and drinking.</NOTE> to giue every man a bit of bread, and a draught of drinke, either Beere, or Wine mingled with water (at the least, the one halfe) or a quantitie min∣gled with Beere, that the pores of the bodie may be full, when the vapours of the Sea ascend vp.</P>
<P>The morning draught should be ever of the best, and choysest of that in the ship. Pure wine I hold to be more hurtfull, then the other is profitable. In this, others will be of a contrary opinion, but I thinke partiall. If not, then leaue I the remedies thereof to those Physitions and Surgeons who haue experience. And I wish that some learned man would write of it, for it is the plague of the Sea, and the spoyle of Mariners; doubtlesse, it would be a meritorious Worke with God and man, and most beneficiall for our Countrie, for in twentie yeares, since that I haue vsed the Sea, I dare take vp∣on me, to giue accompt of ten thousand men consumed with this disease.</P>
<P>That which I haue seene most fruitfull for this sicknesse, is sower Oranges and Lemmons, and a water which amongst others (for my particular provision) I carryed to the Sea, called Doctor <HI>Stevens</HI> his Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By sower O∣ranges and Lemmons. By Doctor <HI>Stevens</HI> water.</NOTE> of which, for that his vertue was not then well knowne vnto me, I carryed but little, and it tooke end quickly, but gaue health to those that vsed it.</P>
<P>The oyle of Vitry is beneficiall for this disease;<NOTE PLACE="marg">By oyle of Vitry.</NOTE> taking two drops of it, and mingled in a draught of water, with a little Sugar.

<P><PB N="39" REF="23"/>It shall not be amisse here to recount the Accidents which befell vs during this contrary winde, and the curiosities to be observed in all this time. Day and night we had continually a fayre gale of winde, and a smooth Sea, without any alteration; one day, the Carpenters having Calked the Decke of our Shippe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dangers of Fire.</NOTE> which the Sunne with his extreame heate had opened, craved licence to heate a little Pitch in the Cook-roome:<NOTE PLACE="marg">By heating of Pitch.</NOTE> which I would not consent vnto by any meanes; for that my Cook-roomes were vnder the Decke, knowing the danger; vntill the Master vndertooke, that no danger should come thereof. But he recommended the charge to another, who had a better name, then experience. He suffered the Pitch to rise, and to runne into the fire, which caused so furi∣ous a flame, as amazed him, and forced all to flie his heate; one of my Company, with a double payre of Gloues tooke off the Pitch-pot, but the fire forced him to let slip his hold-fast, before he could set it on the Hearth, and so overturned it, and as the Pitch began to runne, so the fire to enlarge it selfe, that in a moment a great part of the Shippe was on a light fire. I being in my Cabin, pre∣sently imagined what the matter was, and for all the hast I could make, before I came, the fire was aboue the Decke: for remedie whereof, I commanded all my Companie, to cast their Rugge∣gownes into the Sea, with Ropes fastened vnto them. These I had provided for my people to watch in; for in many hott Countries the nights are fresh and colde; and devided one Gowne to two men, a Starboord and a Larboord man; so that he which watched had ever the Gowne: for they which watched not, were either in their Cabins, or vnder the Decke, and so needed them not. The Gownes being well soked, every man that could, tooke one, and assaulted the fire; and although some were singed, others scalded, and many burned, God was pleased that the fire was quenched, which I thought impossible; And doubtlesse, I never saw my selfe in greater perill in all the dayes of my life. Let all men take exam∣ple by vs, not to suffer (in any case) Pitch to be heate in the Ship, except it be with a shott heate in the fire, which cannot breed daunger: nor to permit fire to be kindled, but vpon meere necessitie; for the inconvenience thereof (is for the most part) remedilesse.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this time of contrary Wind, those of my Compa∣ny which were in health, recreated themselues with Fishing, and beholding the Hunting and Hawking of the Sea, and the Battell betwixt the Whale and his enemies, which truely are of no small pleasure. And therefore for the curious, I will spend some time in Declaration of them.</P>
<P>Ordinarily such Ships as Navigate betweene the <HI>Tropiques,</HI> are accompanied with three sorts of Fish; The <HI>Dolphin,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>Dozado:</HI> The <HI>Bonito,</HI> or Spanish Makerell: and the <HI>Sharke,</HI> alias <HI>Tiberune.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="25"/>The <HI>Dolphin</HI> I hold to be one of the swiftest Fishes in the Sea:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dolphin.</NOTE> He is like vnto a Breame, but that he is longer and thinner, and his scales very small. He is of the coulour of the Rayn-bow, and his head different to other Fishes; for, from his mouth halfe a spanne it goeth straight vpright, as the head of a Wherry, or the Cut-water of a Ship. He is very good meate if he be in season, but the best part of him, is his head, which is great. They are some bigger, some lesser; the greatest that I haue seene, might be some foure foote long.</P>
<P>I hold it not without some ground, that the auncient Philoso∣phers write, that they be <HI>enamoured</HI> of a man: for in meeting with Shipping, they accompany them till they approach to colde Cli∣mates; this I haue noted divers times. For disembarking out of the West <HI>Indies,</HI> Anno 1583. within three or foure dayes after, we mett a Scole of them, which left vs not till we came to the Ilands of <HI>A∣zores,</HI> nere a thousand Leagues. At other times I haue noted the like.</P>
<P>But some may say, that in the Sea are many Scoles of this kinde of Fish, and how can a man know if they were the same?</P>
<P>Who may be thus satisfied, that every day in the morning, which is the time that they approach neerest the Ship, we should see foure, fiue, and more, which had (as it were) our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are-marke, one hurt vpon the backe; another neere the tayle; another about the fynnes, which is sufficient proofe that they were the same. For if those which had received so bad entertainment of vs would not forsake vs, much lesse those which we had not hurt; yet that which makes them most in loue with Ships and Men, are the scrappes and re∣freshing they gather from them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bonito,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bonito.</HI></NOTE> or Spanish Makerell, is altogether like vnto a Make∣rell, but that it is somewhat more growne; he is reasonable foode, but dryer then a Makerell. Of them there are two sorts; the one is this which I haue described; the other, so great, as hardly one man can lift him; At such times as wee haue taken of these, one sufficed for a meale for all my company. These, from the fynne of the tayle forwards haue vpon the chyne seven small yellow hillockes, close one to another.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolphins</HI> and <HI>Bonito's</HI> are taken with certaine instruments of Iron, which we call <HI>Vysgeis,</HI> in forme of an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le-speare, but that the blades are round, and the poynts like vnto the head of a broad Ar∣row; these are fastned to long Staues of ten or twelue foote long, with lynes tyed vnto them, and so shott to the Fish, from the Beake-head, the Poope, or other parts of the Shippe, as occasion is mini∣stred.
<PB N="43" REF="25"/>
They are also caught with Hookes and Lynes, the Hooke being bayted with a redd Cloth, or with a white Cloth, made into the forme of a Fish, and sowed vpon the Hooke.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sharke</HI> or <HI>Tiberune,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sharke.</NOTE> is a Fish like vnto those which wee call Dogge-fishes, but that he is farre greater. I haue seene of them eight or nine foote long; his head is flatt and broad, and his mouth in the middle, vnderneath, as that of the Seate; and he cannot byte of the bayte before him, but by making a halfe turne; and then he helpeth himselfe with his tayle, which serveth him in stead of a Rudder. His skinne is rough (like to the Fish which we call, a rough Hound) and russet, with reddish spottes, saving that vnder the bel∣ly he is all white: he is much hated of Sea-faring men, who haue a certaine foolish superstition with them, and say, that the Ship hath seldome good successe, that is much accompanied with them.</P>
<P>It is the most ravenous Fish knowne in the Sea; for he swallow∣eth all that he findeth. In the Puch of them hath beene sound hatts, cappes, shooes, shirts, leggs and armes of men, ends of Ropes, and many other things; whatsoever is hanged by the Shippes side▪ hee sheereth it, as though it were with a Razor; for he hath three rowes of teeth on either side, as sharpe as Nailes; some say, they are good for Pick-tooths. It hath chanced that a yonker casting himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e into the Sea to swimme, hath had his legge bitten off aboue the knee by one of them. And I haue beene enformed, that in the <HI>Tyger,</HI> when Sir <HI>Richard Greenfild</HI> went to people <HI>Virginia,</HI> a <HI>Sharke</HI> cut off the legge of one of the companie, sitting in the Chaines, and washing himselfe. They spawne not, as the greatest part of Fishes doe, but Whelpe, as the Dogge or Wolfe; and for many dayes after that shee hath whelped every night, and towards any storme, or any danger which may threaten them hurt, the Damme receiveth her Whelpes in at her mouth, and preserveth them, till they be able to shift for themselues. I haue seene them goe in and out, being more then a foote and halfe long; and after, taking the Damme, we haue found her young ones in her belly.</P>
<P>Every day my Company tooke more or lesse of them, not for that they did eate of them (for they are not held wholesome; al∣though the Spaniards, as I haue seene, doe eate them) but to recreate themselues, and in revenge of the iniuries received by them; for they liue long, and suffer much after they bee taken, before they dye.</P>
<P>At the tayl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of one they tyed a great logge of wood, at another, an emptie <HI>Batizia</HI> well stopped; one they yoaked like a Hogge; from another, they plucked out his ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and so threw them in∣to
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>
the Sea. In catching two together, they bound them tayle to tayle, and so set them a swimming; another, with his belly slit, and his bowels hanging out, which his fellowes would haue every one a snatch at; with other infinite inventions to entertayne the time, and to avenge themselues; for that they deprived them of swim∣ming, and fed on their flesh being dead: they are taken with har∣ping Irons, and with great hookes made of purpose, with Swy∣vels and Chaines; for no lyne, nor small rope can hold them, which they share not asunder.</P>
<P>There doth accompany this fish, divers little fishes, which are cal∣let Pilats fishes, and are ever vpon his fynnes, his head, or his backe, and feede of the scraps and superfluities of his prayes. They are in forme of a Trought, and streked like a Makerell, but that the strekes are white and blacke, and the blacke greater then the white.</P>
<P>The manner of Hunting and Hawking representeth that which wee reasonable creatures vse, saving onely in the disposing of the game. For by our industry and abilitie the Hound and Hawke is brought to that obedience, that whatsoever they seize, is for their Master; but here it is otherwise. For the game is for him that sei∣zeth it. The <HI>Dolphins</HI> and <HI>Bonitoes</HI> are the hounds, and the <HI>Alca∣traces</HI> the hawkes, and the flying fishes the game:<NOTE PLACE="marg">flying Fishes.</NOTE> whose wonder∣full making magnifieth the Creator, who for their safetie, and helpe, hath given them extraordinary manner of fynnes, which serue in stead of wings, like those of the Batt or Rere-mous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; of such a delicate skinne, interlaced with small bones so curiously, as may well cause admiration in the beholders. They are like vnto <HI>Pil∣chards</HI> in colour, and making; saving that they are somewhat rounder, and (for the most part) bigger. They flie best with a side wind, but longer then their wings be wett, they cannot sustaine the waight of their bodies; and so the greatest flight that I haue seene them make, hath not beene aboue a quarter of a myle. They commonly goe in Scoles, and serue for food for the greater Fishes, or for the Foules. The <HI>Dolphins</HI> and <HI>Bonitoes</HI> doe continual∣ly hunt after them, and the <HI>Alcatraces</HI> lye soaring in the ayre, to see when they spring, or take their flight; and ordinarily, he that esca∣peth the mouth of the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> or <HI>Bonito,</HI> helping himselfe by his wings, falleth prisoner into the hands of the <HI>Alcatrace,</HI> and helpeth to fill his gorge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Alcatrace</HI> is a Sea-fowle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alcatrace.</HI></NOTE> different to all that I haue seene, either on the land, or in the Sea. His head like vnto the head of a Gull, but his bill like vnto a Snytes bill, somewhat shorter, and in all places alike. He is almost like to a Heronshaw, his leggs a good
<PB N="45" REF="26"/>
spanne long, his wings very long, and sharpe towards the poynts, with a long tayle like to a Pheasant, but with three or foure feathers onely, and these narrower. He is all blacke, of the colour of a Crow, and of little flesh; for he is almost all skinne and bones. He soareth the highest of any fowle that I haue seene, and I haue not heard of any, that haue seene them rest in the Sea.</P>
<P>Now of the fight betwixt the Whale and his contraries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fight of the Whale,</NOTE> which are the Sword fish and the Thresher. The Whale is of the greatest fishes in the Sea; and to count but the truth, vnlesse dayly experi∣ence did witnesse the relation, it might seeme incredible, hee is a huge vnwildlie fish, and to those which haue not seene of them, it might seeme strange, that other fishes should master him; but cer∣taine it is, that many times the Thresher, and Sword fish, meeting him ioyntly, doe make an end of him.</P>
<P>The Sword fish is not great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">with the Sword-fish,</NOTE> but strongly made, and in the top of his chine (as a man may say) betwixt the necke and shoulders, he hath a maner of Sword in substance, like vnto a bone of foure or fiue ynches broad, and aboue three foote long, full of prickles of either side, it is but thin, for the greatest that I haue seene, hath not beene aboue a finger thicke.</P>
<P>The Thresher is a greater fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Thresher.</NOTE> whos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tayle is very broad &amp; thick, and very waightie. They fight in this maner; the Sword fish pla∣ceth himselfe vnder the belly of the Whale, and the Thresher vpon the Ryme of the water, and with his tayle thresheth vpon the head of the Whale, till hee force him to giue way, which the Sword fish perceiving, receiveth him vpon his sword, and wounding him in the belly forceth him to mount vp againe: (besides that, he cannot abide long vnder water, but must of force rise vpp to breath) and when in such maner they torment him, that the sight is sometimes heard aboue three leagues distance, and I dare affirme, that I haue heard the blowes of the Thresher two leagues off, as the report of a peece of Ordinance, the Whales roaring being heard much far∣ther. It also happeneth sundry times, that a great part of the wa∣ter of the Sea round about them, with the blood of the Whale changeth his colour. The best remedy the Whale hath in this ex∣tremitie to helpe himselfe, is to get him to land, which hee pro∣cureth as soone as hee discoverth his adversaries, and getting the shore, there can fight but one with him, and for either of them hand to hand, he is too good. The Whale is a fish not good to be eaten, hee is almost all fat, but esteemed for his trayne: and many goe to the <HI>New-found-land; Greene-land,</HI> and other parts onely to fish for them, which is in this maner; when they which seeke the Whale
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>
discover him, they compasse him round about with Pynaces or Shalops.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The taking of the Whale.</NOTE> In the head of every Boat is placed a man, with a harping Iron, and a long Lyne, the one end of it fastned to the harping iron, and the other end to the head of the Boat; In which it lyeth finely coyled; and for that he cannot keepe long vnder water, he sheweth which way he goeth, when rising neere any of the Boats, within reach, he that is neerest, darteth his harping Iron at him. The Whale finding himselfe to be wounded, swimmeth to the bottome, and draweth the Pynace after him; which the Fisher men present∣ly forsake, casting themselues into the Sea; for that many times he draweth the Boat vnder water: those that are next, procure to take them vp. For this cause all such as goe for that kinde of Fishing, are experimented in swimming. When one harping Iron is fastned in the Whale, it is easily discerned which way he directeth his course; and so ere long they fasten another, and another in him. When he hath three or foure Boats dragging after him; with their waight, his bleeding, and fury, he becommeth so over-mastred, that the rest of the Pynaces with their presence and terror, driue him to the place where they would haue him, nature instigating him to covet the shore.</P>
<P>Being once hurt, there is little need to force him to land. Once on the shore, they presently cut great peeces of him, and in great Cauldrons seeth them. The vppermost in the Cauldrons is the fatt, which they skimme off, and put it into Hogsheads and Pipes. This is that they call Whales oyle, or Traine oyle, accompted the best sort of Traine oyle. It is hard to be beleeved, what quantitie is gathered of one Whale; Of the tongue, I haue beene enformed, haue many Pipes beene filled. The fynnes are also esteemed for many and sundry vses; as is his spawne for divers purposes: This wee corruptly call <HI>Parmacittie</HI>; of the Latine word, <HI>Sperma Ceti.</HI></P>
<P>And the precious <HI>Amber-greece</HI> (some thinke also) to be found in his bowells,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Amber-greece.</HI></NOTE> or voyded by him; but not in all seas; yea, they maintaine for certaine, that the same is ingendred by eating an hearbe which groweth in the Sea. This hearbe is not in all Seas, say they, and therefore, where it wanteth, the Whales giue not this fruit! In the coast of the <HI>East Indies</HI> in many partes is great quanti∣tie. In the coastes of <HI>Guyne,</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> of the <HI>Florida,</HI> in the Ilands of <HI>Cape de Verde,</HI> and the <HI>Canaries, Amber-greece</HI> hath beene many times found, and sometimes on the coast of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> Wherevpon it is presumed, that all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Seas haue not the hearbe growing in them. The cause why the Whale should eate this
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>
hearbe, I haue not heard, nor read. It may be surmised, that it is as that of the Becunia, and other Beasts, which breed the Beazer stone;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beazar stone.</NOTE> who feeding in the valleyes and mountaines, where are many vene∣mous Serpents, and hearbes; when they find themselues touched with any poyson, forthwith they runne for remedie to an hearbe, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call, <HI>Contra yerva,</HI> that is to say, contrary to poyson; which having eaten, they are presently cured: but the sub∣stance of the hearbe converteth it selfe into a medicinable stone; So it may be, that the Whale feeding of many sorts of fishes, and some of them (as is knowne) venemous, when he findeth himselfe touched, with this hearbe he cureth himselfe; and not being able to digest it, nature converteth it into this substance, provoketh it out, or dyeth with it in his belly; and being light, the Sea bringeth it to the Coast.</P>
<P>All these are imaginations, yet instruments to mooue vs to the glorifying of the great and vniversall Creatour of all, whose secret wisedome, and wonderfull workes, are incomprehensible.</P>
<P>But the more approved generation of the <HI>Amber greece,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Amber greece.</NOTE> and which carrieth likliest probabilitie is, that it is a liquor which issueth out of certaine Fountaines, in sundry Seas, and being of a light and thicke substance, participating of the ayre, suddenly becommeth hard, as the yellow <HI>Amber,</HI> of which they make Beads; which is al∣so a liquor of a Fountaine in the Germayne Sea: In the bottome it is soft and white, and partaking of the ayre becommeth hard and stonie: Also the Corrall in the Sea is soft, but comming into the ayre, becommeth a stone.</P>
<P>Those who are of this former opinion, thinke the reason (why the <HI>Amber greece</HI> is sometimes found in the Whale) to be for that he swalloweth it, as other things, which he findeth swimming vp∣on the water; and not able digest it, it remaineth with him till his death.</P>
<P>Another manner of fishing, and catching the Whale I cannot omit, vsed by the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Florida</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> worthy to be considered, in as much as the barbarous people haue found out so great a secret, by the industry and diligence of one man, to kill so great and huge a Monster; it is in this manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> discovering a Whale, procureth two round billets of wood, sharpneth both at one end, and so binding them together with a cord, casteth himselfe with them into the Sea, and swimmeth towards the Whale; if he come to him, the Whale escapeth not; for he placeth himselfe vpon his necke, and although the Whale goeth to the bottome, he must of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce rise presently to breath, (for
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>
which nature hath given him two great holes in the toppe of his head, by which every time that he breatheth, he spouteth out a great quantitie of water) the <HI>Indian</HI> forsaketh not his holde, but riseth with him, and thrusteth in a Logg into one of his Spowters, and with the other knocketh it in so fast, that by no meanes the Whale can get it out: That fastned, at another opportunitie, he thrusteth in the second Logg into the other Spowter, and with all the force he can, keepeth it in.</P>
<P>The Whale not being able to breath, swimmeth presently a∣shore, and the <HI>Indian</HI> a cock-horse vpon him, which his fellowes discovering, approach to helpe him, and to make an end of him: it serveth them for their foode many dayes after.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> haue taught them the estimation of Amber greece, they seeke curiously for it, sell it to them, and others, for such things as they best fancie, and most esteeme; which are (as I haue beene enformed) all sortes of edge-tooles, Copper, Glasses, Glasse-beads, red Caps, Shirts, and Pedlery ware. Vpon this sub∣iect, divers <HI>Spaniards</HI> haue discoursed vnto mee, who haue beene eye witnesses thereof, declaring them to be valorous, ventrous, and in∣dustrious: otherwise they durst not vndertake an enterprise so dif∣ficult and full of danger.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Etwixt nineteene and twenty degrees to the South-wards of the lyne, the winde tooke vs contrary, which together with the sicknes of my people made mee to seeke the shore, and about the end of October, we had sight of the Land, which presenlty by our height and the making of it, discovered it selfe to be the port of <HI>Santos, alias no∣stra Senora de Victoria,</HI> and is easie to be knowne, for it hath a great high hill over the Port, which (howsoever a man commeth with the land) riseth like a bell, and comming neere the shore presently is discovered a white Tower or Fort, which standeth vpon the top of a hill over the Harbour, and vpon the seamost land: It is the first land a man must compasse, before he enter the Port; comming within two Leagues of the shore we anchored, and the Captaynes and Masters of my other ships, being come aboord, it was thought convenient (the weakenes of our men considered, for wee had not in our three ships twenty foure men sound) and the winde vncer∣taine when it might change, we thought with pollicie to procure that, which wee could not by force; and so to offer traffique to the people of the shore, by that meanes to proue, if wee could attayne some refreshing for our sicke Company.</P>
<P>In execution whereof, I wrote a letter to the Governour in La∣tine, and sent him with it a peece of crymson Velvet, a bolt of fine Holland, with divers other things, as a present; and with it, the Captaine of my ship, who spake a little broken Spanish, giving the Governour to vnderstand, that I was bound to the East <HI>Indies,</HI> to traf∣fique in those parts, and that contrary windes had forced me vpon that Coast: If that hee were pleased to like of it, for the commodi∣ties the Countrie yeelded in aboundance, I would exchange that, which they wanted. With these instructions my Captaine departed about nine of the clocke in the morning, carrying a flagge of truce in the head of the boate, and sixteene men well armed, and provi∣ded; guided by one of my Company which two yeares before had beene Captaine in that place, and so was a reasonable Pilot.</P>
<P>Entring the Port, within a quarter of a myle is a small Village, and three Leagues higher vp, is the chiefe Towne: where they haue two Forts, one on eyther side of the Harbour, and within them ride the Ships which come thither to discharge, or loade. In the small Village is ever a Garrison of a hundreth Souldiers, whereof
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>
part assist there continually, and in the white Tower vpon the top of the hill, which commaundeth it.</P>
<P>Heere my Captaine had good entertainement, and those of the shore received his message and Letter, dispatching it presently to the Governour, who was some three Leagues off in another place: at least, they beare vs so in hand. In the time that they expected the Post, my Captaine with one other entertained himselfe with the Souldiers a shore, who after the common custome of their profes∣sion (except when they be <HI>hesonios</HI>) sought to pleasure him, and finding that he craved but Oranges, Lemmons, and matters of smal moment for refreshing for his Generall, they suffered the women and Children to bring him what hee would, which hee gratified with double Pistolets, that I had given him for that purpose. So got hee vs two or three hundreth Oranges and Lemmons, and some fewe Hennes.</P>
<P>All that day and night, and the next day, till nine of the clocke, wee waited the returne of our boate; which not appearing, bred in me some suspition, and for my satisfaction I man'd a light horse∣man which I had, and the <HI>Fancie,</HI> the best I could; shewing strength, where was weakenesse and infirmity, and so set sayle towardes the Port; our Gunner taking vpon him to bee Pilote, for that hee had beene there some yeares before.</P>
<P>Thus, with them we entred the Harbour, my Captaine having notice of our being within the Barre, came aboord with the Boat, which was no small ioy to me; and more, to see him bring vs store of Oranges and Lemmons, which was that we principally sought for, as the remedie of our diseased Company. He made relation of that had past, and how they expected present answere from the go∣vernour. We anchored right against the village, and within two houres, by a Flagge of Truce, which they on the shore shewed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, wee vnderstood that the Messenger was come: our Boat went for the answere of the governour, who said, he was sorry that he could not accomplish our desire, being so reasonable and good; for that in consideration of the warre betwixt <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> he had expresse order from his King, not to suffer any <HI>English</HI> to trade with∣in his iurisdiction, no, nor to land, or to take any refreshing vpon the shore. And therefore craved pardon, and that wee should take this for a resolute answere: And further, required vs to depart the Port within three dayes, which he said he gaue vs, for our courte∣ous manner of proceeding; If any of my people from that time forwards, should approach to the shore, that he would doe his best to hinder and annoy them. With this answere wee resolved to de∣part;
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>
and before it came, with the first faire wind, we determined to be packing: but the wind suffered vs not all that night, nor the next day. In which time, I lived in a great perplexitie, for that I knew our owne weaknesse, and what they might doe vnto vs, if that they had knowne so much. For any man that putteth himselfe into the enemies Port, had need of <HI>Argus</HI> eyes, and the wind in a bagge, especially, where the enemie is strong, and the tydes of any force. For, with either ebbe or flood, those who are on the shore, may thrust vpon him inventions of fire; and with swimming, or other devises may cut his Cables. A common practise in all hott Coun∣tries. The like may be effected with Raffes, Cannoas, Boates or Pynaces, to annoy and assault him; and if this had beene practised against vs, or taken effect, our Shippes must of force haue yeelded themselues; for they had no other people in them but sicke men; but many times opinion and feare preserveth the Shippes, and not the people in them.</P>
<P>Wherefore it is the part of a provident Governour, to consider well the daungers that may befall him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For preventi∣on of annoy∣ances, &amp;c. in Harbours.</NOTE> before he put himselfe into such places; So shall he ever be provided for prevention.</P>
<P>In Saint <HI>Iohn de Vlua,</HI> in the <HI>New-Spaine,</HI> when the <HI>Spanyards</HI> dishonoured their Nation with that foule act of periury, and breach of faith, given to my Father, Sir <HI>Iohn Hawkins</HI> (notorious to the whole world) the <HI>Spanyards</HI> fired two great Shippes, with intenti∣on to burne my Fathers Admirall, which he prevented by towing them with his Boates another way.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Armado</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> sent to conquer <HI>England,</HI> Anno 1588. was with that selfe same industry overthrowne; for the setting on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire of six or seaven shippes (whereof two were mine) and letting them drive with the flood, forced them to cut their Cables, and to put to Sea, to seeke a new way to <HI>Spaine.</HI> In which the greatest part of their best Shippes and men were lost and perished.</P>
<P>For that my people should not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dismayed, I dispatched pre∣sently my Light-horsman; with onely foure men, and part of the refreshing, advising them that with the first calme, or slent of wind, they should come off.</P>
<P>The next night, the wind comming off the shore wee set sayle, and with our Boates and Barkes founded as we went.</P>
<P>It flowed vpon the Barre not aboue foure foote water, and once in foure and twentie houres (as in some parts of the West <HI>Indies</HI>) at full Sea there is not vpon the barre aboue 17. or 18. foote water.

But he comming out of the darke, had his sight more forcible, to discerne the difference of the Sea, and the shore. So that forthwith he commaunded him at the Helme, to put it close a star∣bourd, and tacking our Ship, wee edged off; and sounding, found scant three fathome water, whereby we saw evidently, the miracu∣lous mercie of our God; that if he had not watched over vs, as hee doth continually over his, doubtlesse, we had perished without re∣medie; To whom be all glory, and prayse everlastingly, world without end.</P>

<P>The next day following, we discovered the Ilands, where wee purposed to refresh our selues: They are two, and some call them Saint <HI>Iames</HI> his Ilands, and others, Saint <HI>Annes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint <HI>Iames</HI> Ilands, <HI>alias</HI> Saint <HI>Annes.</HI></NOTE> They lie in two and twentie degrees and a halfe to the South-wards of the lyne; and towards the evening (being the fifth of <HI>November</HI>) we ancho∣red betwixt them and the Mayne, in six fathome water, where wee found our other Shippes.</P>
<P>All which being well Moored, we presently began to set vp Tents and Booths for our sicke men, to carry them a shore, and to vse our best diligence to cure them. For which intent our three Surgeans, with their servants and adherents, had two Boates to wayte conti∣nually vpon them, to fetch whatsoever was needfull from the Shippes, to procure refreshing, and to Fish, either with Netts, or Hookes, and Lynes. Of these implements wee had in aboundance, and it yeelded vs some refreshing. For the first dayes, the most of those which had health, occupied themselues in romeging our Ship, in bringing a shore of emptie Caske, in filling of them, and in felling and cutting of Wood: which being many workes, and few hands, went slowly forwards.</P>
<P>Neere these Ilands, are two great Rockes, or small Ilands adioy∣ning. In them we found great store of young <HI>Gannetts</HI> in their nests,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gannets.</HI></NOTE> which we reserved for the sicke, and being boyled with pickled Porke well watered, and mingled with Oatmeale, made reasona∣ble

<P>With the ayre of the shore, and good cherishing, many recovered speedily▪ Some died away quickly, and others continued at a stand. We found here some store of fruits; a kind of Cherry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cherries.</NOTE> that groweth vpon a tree like a Plum-tree, red of colour, with a stone in it, but different in making to ours, for it is not altogether round, and den∣ted about: they haue a pleasing taste.</P>
<P>In one of the Ilands, we found <HI>Palmito</HI> trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palmitos.</NOTE> great and high, and in the toppe a certaine fruit like Cocos, but no bigger then a Wall∣nut. We found also a fruit growing vpon trees in codds, like Beanes, both in the codd, and the fruit. Some of my Company proved of them, and they caused vomits and purging,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purgatiues.</NOTE> as any medicine taken out of the Apothecaries shop, according to the quantitie received. They haue hudds, as our Beanes, which shaled off, the kernell par∣teth it selfe in two, and in the middle is a thin skinne (like that of an Onion) said to be hurtfull, and to cause exceeding vomits, and therefore to be cast away.</P>
<P><HI>Monardus</HI> writing of the nature and propertie of this fruit, as of others of the <HI>Indies,</HI> for that it is found in other parts, also calleth them <HI>Havas purgativas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse of <HI>Havas purga∣tivas.</HI></NOTE> and sayth, that they are to be prepared, by peeling them first, and then taking away the skinne in the middle, and after beaten into powder, to take the quantitie of fiue or sixe, either with Wine or Sugar.

Here we spent aboue a moneth in curing of our sicke men, supplying our wants of Wood and Water, and in other neces∣sary workes. And the tenth of December (all things put in order) we set sayle for <HI>Cape Frio,</HI> having onely six men sicke, with purpose there to set ashore our two Prisoners before named; and anchoring vnder the Cape, we sent our Boat a shore, but they could not finde any convenient place to land them in, and so returned: the Wind being Southerly, and not good to goe on our voyage, we succoured our selues within <HI>Isla Grand,</HI> which lyeth some dozen or foureteene Leagues from the Cape, betwixt the West, and by South and West South-west; the rather to set our Prisoners a shore.</P>

all the rest desert: on this Iland our Prisoners desired to be put a∣shore, and promised to send vs some refreshing. Whereto we con∣descended, and sent them a shore, with two Boates well man'd and armed, who sound few Inhabitants in the Iland; for our people saw not aboue foure or fiue houses, notwithstanding our Boats returned loaden with Plantynes, Pinias, Potatoes, Sugar-canes, and some Hennes. Amongst which they brought a kind of little Plantyne, greene, and round, which were the best of any that I haue seene.</P>
<P>With our people came a Portingall, who said, that the Iland was his; he seemed to be a <HI>Mistecho,</HI> who are those that are of a Spanish and an <HI>Indian</HI> brood, poorely apparelled and miserable; we feasted him, and gaue him some trisles, and he according to his abilitie answered our courtesie with such as he had.</P>
<P>The wind continuing contrary, we emptied all the water wee could come by, which we had silled in Saint <HI>Iames</HI> his Iland, and filled our Caske with the water of this <HI>Isla Grand.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grand.</HI></NOTE> It is a wildernesse covered with Trees and Shrubbes so thicke, as it hath no passage through, except a man make it by force. And it was strange to heare the howling and cryes of wilde Beastes in these Woods day and night, which we could not come at to see by any meanes; some like Lyons, others like Beares, others like Hoggs, and of such and so many diversities, as was admirable.</P>
<P>Heere our Nets profited vs much; for in the sandy Bayes they tooke vs store of fish. Vpon the shore at full Sea-marke, we found in many places certaine shels, like those of Mother of Pearles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shells of mo∣ther of pearle.</NOTE> which are brought out of the East <HI>Indies,</HI> to make standing cups, called <HI>Ca∣racoles;</HI> of so great curiositie as might moue all the beholders to magnifie the maker of them; And were it not for the brittlenes of them, by reason of their exceeding thinnes, doubtles they were to bee esteemed farre aboue the others; for, more excellent worke∣manship I haue not seene in shels.</P>
<P>The 18. of December, wee set sayle the wind at North-east, and directed our course for the Straites of <HI>Magalianes.</HI> The twenty two of this moneth, at the going too of the Sunne, we descryed a Por∣tingall ship, and gaue her chase, and comming within hayling of her, shee rendred her selfe, without any resistance, shee was of an hundred Tuns bound for <HI>Angola</HI> to load Negroes, to be carried and sold in the River of <HI>Plate</HI>; It is a trade of great profit, &amp; much vsed, for that the Negroes are carried from the head of the river of <HI>Plate,</HI> to <HI>Patosi,</HI> to labour in the Mynes.

Some haue told me, that of late they haue found out the trade, and benefit of <HI>Cochanillia,</HI> but the River suffe∣reth not vessels of burthen; for if they drawe aboue eight or seaven foote water, they cannot goe further; then the mouth of the Ri∣ver, and the first habitation is aboue a hundred and twenty leagues vp, whereunto many Barkes trade yearely, and carry all kinde of Marchandize serving for <HI>Patosi</HI> and <HI>Paraquay</HI>; the money which is thence returned, is distributed in all the Coast of <HI>Brasill.</HI></P>
<P>The loading of this Ship was meale of <HI>Cassavi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cassavi</HI> meale.</NOTE> which the Por∣tingals call <HI>Furina de Paw.</HI> It served for Marchandize in <HI>Angola,</HI> for the Portingals foode in the ship, and to nourish the Negroes, which they should carry to the river of <HI>Plate</HI>; This meale is made of a cer∣taine roote which the <HI>Indians</HI> call <HI>Yuca,</HI> much like vnto <HI>Potatoes.</HI> Of it are two kindes; the one sweete and good to be eaten (either ro∣sted or sodden) as <HI>Potatoes,</HI> and the other of which they make their bread, called <HI>Cassavi,</HI> deadly poyson, if the liquor or iuyce bee not throughly pressed out. So prepared it is the bread of <HI>Brasill,</HI> and many parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which they make in this maner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prepa∣ring thereof for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood.</NOTE> first they pare the roote, and then vpon a rough stone they grate it as small us they can, and after that it is grated small, they put it into a bag or poke, and betwixt two Stones with great waight, they presse out the iuyce, or poyson, and after keepe it in some bag, till it haue no iuyce nor moysture left. Of this they make two sorts of bread, the one finer, and the other courser, but bake them after one maner. They place a great broad smooth stone vpon other foure, which serue in steede of a Trevet, and make a quicke fire vnder it, and so strawe the flower or meale a foote long, and halfe a foot broad. To make it to incorporate, they sprinkle now and then a little water, and then another rowe of meale, and another sprinkling, till it be to their minde; That which is to be spent presently, they make a finger thicke, and sometimes more thicke; but that which they make for store, is not aboue halfe a finger thicke, but so hard, that if it fall on the ground it will not breake easily: Being newly baked, it is reasonable good, but after fewe dayes it is not to be eaten, ex∣cept it be soaked in water. In some partes they suffer the meale to become fen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, before they make it into bread; and hold it for the best; saying, that it giveth a better tast, but I am not of that o∣pinion; In other parts they mingle it with a fruite called <HI>Agnane∣pes,</HI> which are round, and being ripe are gray, and as big as an hazell n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and grow in a cod like pease, but that it is all curiously wrought, first they parch them vpon a stone, and after beate them into pow∣der, and then mingle them with the fine flower of <HI>Cassavi,</HI> and bake

<P>The <HI>Agnanapes</HI> are pleasant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Agnanapes.</HI></NOTE> giue the bread a yellowish colour, and an Aromaticall savour in taste. The finer of this bread, being well baked, keepeth long time, three or foure yeares. In <HI>Brasill,</HI> since the <HI>Portingalls</HI> taught the <HI>Indians</HI> the vse of Sugar, they eate this meale mingled with remels of Sugar, or Malasses; and in this man∣ner the <HI>Portingalls</HI> themselues feed of it.</P>
<P>But we found a better manner of dressing this <HI>Farina,</HI> in making Pancakes, and frying them with butter, or oyle; and sometimes with <HI>Mant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ca de Puerco</HI>; when, strewing a little Sugar vpon them, it was meate that our company desired aboue any that was in the Shippe.</P>

<P>First, is chewing it in their mouths, and after mingling it with water, after a loathsome manner, yet the commonest drinke that they haue; and that held best which is chewed by an old woman.</P>
<P>The second manner of their drinke, is baking it till it be halfe burned, then they beate it into Powder; and when they will drinke, they mingle a small quantitie of it with water, which giueth a rea∣sonable good taste.</P>
<P>The third, and best, is baking it (as aforesaid) and when it is beaten into Powder, to seeth it in water; after that it is well boyled, they let it stand some three or foure dayes, and then drinke it. So, it is much like the Ale which is vsed in <HI>England,</HI> and of that colour and taste.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> are very curious in planting and manuring of this <HI>Yuca</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of planting <HI>Iuca,</HI></NOTE> It is a little shrubb, and carryeth branches like Hazell wands; being growne as bigge as a mans finger, they breake them off in the middest, and so pricke them into the ground; it needeth no other art, or husbandry, for out of each branch grow two, three, or foure rootes, some bigger, some lesser: but first they burne and manure the ground, the which labour, and whatsoever els is requisite, the men doe not so much as helpe with a finger, but all lyeth vpon their poore women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">with the la∣bour of the women.</NOTE> who are worse then slaues; for, they labour the ground, they plant, they digge and delue, they bake, they brew, and dresse their meate, fetch their water, and doe all drudgerie whatsoever; yea, though they nurse a Childe, they are not exemp∣ted from any labour; their Childe they carry in a Wallet about their necke, ordinarily vnder one arme, because it may sucke when it will.</P>

This I haue sorrowed for many times since, for that it had likeli∣hood to be an excellent Countrie. It hath great Rivers of fresh waters; for the out-shoot of them colours the Sea in many places, as we ran alongst it. It is not mountaynous, but much of the dispo∣sition of <HI>England,</HI> and as temperate. The things we noted principally on the coast, are these following; the westermost poynt of the land, with which we first fell, is the end of the land to the West-wardes, as we found afterwards. If a man bring this poynt South-west, it ri∣seth in three mounts, or round hillockes: bringing it more Wester∣ly, they shoot themselues all into one; and bringing it Easterly, it riseth in two hillocks. This we called poyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Tremountaine.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Poynt <HI>Tre∣mountaine.</HI></NOTE> Some twelue or foureteene leagues from this poynt to the East-wardes, fayre by the shore, lyeth a low flat Iland of some two leagues long; we named it <HI>Fayre Iland</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Payre Iland.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or it was all over as greene and smooth, as any Meddow in the spring of the yeare.</P>
<P>Some three or foure leagues Easterly from this Iland, is a good∣ly opening, as of a great River, or an arme of the Sea, with a good∣ly low Countrie adiacent. And eight or tenne leagues from this o∣pening, some three leagues from the shore, lyeth a bigge Rocke, which at the first wee had thought to be a Shippe vnder all her Sayles; but after, as we came neere, it discovered it selfe to be a Rocke, which we called <HI>Condite-head</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Condite head.</NOTE> for that howsoever a man commeth with it, it is like to the Condite heads about the Cittie of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>All this coast so farre as wee discovered, lyeth next of any thing East and by North, and West and by South. The land, for that it was discovered in the raigne of Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> my soveraigne Lady and Mistris, and a maiden Queene, and at my cost and adven∣ture, in a perpetuall memory of her chastitie, and remembrance of my endevours, I gaue it the name of HAVVKINS-<HI>maiden-land.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hawkins</HI>-mai∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n-land.</NOTE></P>

<P>With our fayre and large Winde, we shaped our course for the <HI>Straites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our comming to the <HI>Straites.</HI></NOTE> and the tenth of February, we had sight of land, and it was the head land of the <HI>Straites</HI> to the North-wards, which agreed with our height, wherein we found our selues to be, which was in thir∣tie two degrees and fortie minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="39"/>Within a few houres we had the mouth of the <HI>Straites</HI> open; which lyeth in 52. degrees, and 50. minuts. It riseth like the North foreland in <HI>Kent,</HI> and is much like the land of <HI>Margates.</HI> It is not good to borrow neere the shore, but to giue it a fayre birth; within a few houres we entred the mouth of the <HI>Straites,</HI> which is some six leagues broad, and lyeth in 52. degrees, and 50. minutes; dou∣bling the poynt on the Star-board, which is also flat, of a good birth, we opened a fayre Bay, in which we might discry the hull of a Ship beaten vpon the Beach. It was of the Spanish Fleete, that went to inhabite there, in Anno 1582. vnder the charge of <HI>Pedro Sarmiento,</HI> who at his returne was taken Prisoner, and brought into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In this Bay the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made their principall habitation, and called it the Cittie of Saint <HI>Philip,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pedro Sarmi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣to</HI> bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th <HI>San-Philip.</HI></NOTE> and left it peopled; But the cold barrennes of the Countrie, and the malice of the <HI>Indians,</HI> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h whom they badly agreed, made speedie end of them, as also of those, whom they left in the middle of the <HI>Straites,</HI> three leagues from Cape <HI>Froward</HI> to the East-wards, in another habitation.</P>
<P>We continued our course alongst this reach (for all the <HI>Straites</HI> is as a River altering his course, sometimes vpon one poynt, some∣times vpon another) which is some eight Leagues long, and lyeth West North-west. From this we entred into a goodly Bay, which runneth vp into the land Northerly many Leagues; and at first en∣trance, a man may see no other thing, but as it were, a maine Sea. From the end of this first reach, you must direct your course West South-west, and some foureteene or fifteene leagues lyeth one of the narrowest places of all the <HI>Straites</HI>; This leadeth vnto another reach, that lyeth west and by north some six leagues.</P>
<P>Here in the middle of the reach, the wind tooke vs by the north-west, and so we were forced to anchor some two or three dayes. In which time, we went a shore with our Boates, and found neere the middle of this reach, on the Star-boord side, a reasonable good place to ground and trimme a small Ship; where it higheth some nine or ten foote water. Here we saw certaine Hogges, but they were so farre from vs, that wee could not discerne, if they were of those of the Countrie, or brought by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; these were all the Beasts which we saw in all the time we were in the <HI>Straites.</HI></P>
<P>In two tydes we turned through this reach, and so recovered the Ilands of <HI>Pengwins</HI>; they lye from this reach foure leagues South-west and by west.

<P>Betwixt the former reach, and these Ilands, runneth vp a good∣ly Bay into the Country to the North-wards. It causeth a great indraught, and aboue these Ilands runneth a great tide from the mouth of the Straites to these Ilands, the land on the larboord-side is low land and sandy, (for the most part, and without doubt, I∣lands) for it hath many openings into the Sea, and forcible in∣draughts by them, and that on the starboord side, is all high moun∣taynous land, from end to end; but no wood on eyther side. Be∣fore wee passed these Ilands, vnder the lee of the bigger Iland we anchored, the wind being at North-east, with intent to refresh our selues with the fowles of these Ilands. They are of divers sorts, and in great plentie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good provi∣sion in the <HI>Straites.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Pengwins,</HI> wilde <HI>Ducks, Gulles</HI> and <HI>Gannets</HI>; of the principall we purposed to make provision, and those were the <HI>Pengwins</HI>; which in Welsh (as I haue beene enformed) signifi∣eth a white head.

Which con∣ferred which an auncient Cronicle, that I haue read many yeares since, may bee coniectured to bee a Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who many hundreth yeares since, with certaine shippes, sayled to the west∣wards, with intent to make new discoveries.

<P>The <HI>Pengwin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The descrip∣tion of the <HI>Pengwin.</HI></NOTE> is in all proportion like vnto a Goose, and hath no feathers, but a certaine doune vpon all parts of his body: and therefore cannot flie, but avayleth himselfe in all occasions with his feete, running as fast as most men. He liveth in the Sea, and on the Land; feedeth on fish in the Sea, and as a Goose on the shore vpon grasse. They harbour themselues vnder the ground in burrowes, as the Connies; and in them hatch their young. All parts of the
<PB N="73" REF="40"/>
Iland where they haunted were vndermined, saue onely one valley which (it seemeth) they reserved for their foode; for it was as green as any Medowe in the moneth of Aprill, with a most fine short grasse. The flesh of these <HI>Pengwins</HI> is much of the savour of a cer∣taine fowle taken in the Ilands of <HI>Lundey</HI> and <HI>Silley,</HI> which wee call <HI>Puffins;</HI> by the tast it is easily discerned that they feede on fish. They are very fatt, and in dressing must be flead as the <HI>Byter</HI>; they are rea∣sonable meate, rosted, baked, or sodden; but best rosted. We salt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d some dozen or 16. hogsheads, which served vs (whilest they lasted) in steede of powdred beefe.</P>
<P>The hunting of them (as we may well terme it) was a great re∣creation to my Company and worth the sight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting the <HI>Pengwin.</HI></NOTE> for in determining to catch them, necessarily was required good store of people, eve∣ry one with a cudgell in his hand, to compasse them round about, to bring them, as it were, into a ring; if they chanced to breake out, then was the sport, for the ground being vndermined, at vnawares it fayled, and as they ran after them, one fell here, another there; ano∣ther offering to strike at one, lifting vp his hand, sunke vpp to the arme pits in the earth, another leaping to avoyd one hole, fell into another. And after the first slaughter, in seeing vs on the shore, they shunned vs, and procured to recover the Sea; yea many times seeing themselues persecuted they would tumble downe from such high rocks &amp; mountaines, as it seemed impossible to escape with life. Yet as soone as they came to the beach, presently wee should see them runne into the Sea, as though they had no hurt. Where one goeth, the other followeth like sheepe after the Bel-wether; but in getting them once within the ring close together, few escaped, saue such as by chance hid themselues in the borrowes, and ordinarily there was no droue which yeelded vs not a thousand, and more: the maner of killing them which the hunters vsed, being in a cluster together, was with their cudgels to kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cke them on the head; for though a man gaue them many blowes on the body, they di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not: Besides the flesh brused is not good to keepe. The Massaker ended, presently they cut off their heads, that they might bleede well: such as we de∣termined to keepe for store,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The keeping for store.</NOTE> wee saved in this maner. First, we split them, and then washed them well in sea water, then salted them, having layne some sixe howres in salt, wee put them in presse eight howres, and the blood being soaked out, we salted them a∣gaine in our other caske, as is the custome to salt beefe, after this maner they continued good, some two moneths, and served vs in stead of beefe.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gulls</HI> and <HI>Gannets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gulls,</HI></NOTE> were not in so great quantitie, yet we wan∣ted

<P>The Ducks are different to ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ducks.</NOTE> and nothing so good meate; yet they may serue for necessitie: They were many, and had a part of the Iland to themselues severall, which was the highest hill, and more then a Musket shott over.</P>
<P>In all the dayes of my life, I haue not seene greater Art and cu∣riositie in creatures voyd of reason, then in the placing and making of their nestes; all the hill being so full of them, that the greatest <HI>Mathematician</HI> of the world, could not devise how to place one more then there was vpon the hill, leaving onely one path-way for a fowle to passe betwixt.</P>
<P>The hill was all levell, as if it had beene smoothed by Art; the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes made onely of earth, and seeming to be of the selfe same mould; for the nests and the soyle is all one, which, with water that they bring in their Beakes, they make into Clay, or a certaine dawbe, and after fashion them round, as with a Compasse. In the bottome they containe the measure of a foote; in the height about eight inches; and in the toppe, the same quantitie over; there, they are hollowed in, somewhat deepe, wherein they lay their eggs, without other prevention. And I am of opinion, that the Sunne helpeth them to hatch their young: their nests are for many yeares, and of one proportion, not one exceeding another in bignesse, in height, nor circumference; and in proportionable distance one from another. In all this hill, nor in any of their nestes, was to be found a blade of grasse, a straw, a sticke, a feather, a moate, no, nor the filing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owle, but all the nestes and passages betwixt them, were so smooth and cleane, as if they had beene newly swept and washed.</P>
<P>All which are motiues to prayse and magnifie the vniversall Creator, who so wonderfully manifesteth his wisedome, bountie, and providence in all his Creatures, and especially for his par∣ticular loue to ingratefull mankinde, for whose contemplation and service, he hath made them all.</P>

This we remedied the best wee could, and discovered it long before we came to this place.</P>
<P>Hereof let others take warning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warning a∣gainst wormes.</NOTE> in no place to haue Caske on the shore, where it may be avoyded; for it is one of the provisions, which are with greatest care to be preserved in long Voyages, and hardest to be supplyed. These <HI>Arters,</HI> or <HI>Broma,</HI> in all hot Countries enter into the plankes of Shippes, and especially where are Rivers of fresh water; (for the common opinion is, that they are bred in fresh water, and with the current of the Rivers are brought into the Sea) but experience teacheth, that they breed in the great Seas in all hott Clymates, especially neere the Equinoctiall lyne; for lying so long vnder and neere the lyne, and towing a Shalop at our sterne, cōming to clense her in <HI>Brasil,</HI> we found her all vnder water covered with these wormes, as bigge as the little finger of a man, on the out∣side of the planke, not fully covered, but halfe the thicknes of their bodie, like to a gelly wrought into the planke as with a Gowdge. And naturall reason (in my iudgement) confirmeth this; for crea∣tures bread and nourished in the Sea, comming into fresh water die; as those actually bred in Ponds, or fresh Rivers die presently, if they come into Salt water.</P>
<P>But some man may say; this fayleth in some Fishes and Beasts.</P>
<P>Which I must confesse to be true; but these eyther are part ter∣restryall, and part aquatile, as the Mare-maide, Sea-horse, and other of that kind, or haue their breeding in the fresh, and growth or con∣tinuall nourishment in the Salt water, as the Salmond, and others of that kinde.</P>
<P>In little time, if the Shippe be not sheathed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheathing of Shippes.</NOTE> they put all in haz∣zard; for they enter in no bigger then a small Spanish Needle, and by little and little their holes become ordinarily greater then a mans finger. The thicker the planke is, the greater he groweth;
<PB N="79" REF="43"/>
yea, I haue seene many Shippes so eaten, that the most of their plankes vnder water haue beene like honey combes, and especially those betwixt wind and water. If they had not beene sheathed, it had bin impossible that they could haue swomme. The entring of them is hardly to be discerned, the most of them being small as the head of a Pinne. Which, all such, as purpose long Voyages, are to prevent by sheathing their Shippes.</P>

<P>Another manner is vsed with double plankes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">with double plankes.</NOTE> as thicke without as within, after the manner of furring; which is little better then that with Lead; for, besides his waight, it dureth little, because the worme in small time passeth through the one and the other.</P>

<P>The fourth prevention, which now is most accompted of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With burnt plankes.</NOTE> is to burne the vtter planke till it come to be in every place like a Cole, and after to pitch it; this is not bad.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> (as I haue beene enformed) they vse a certaine Betane or Varnish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>China</HI> with Varnish.</NOTE> in manner of an artificiall pitch, wherewith they trim the outside of their shippes. It is said to be durable, and of that ver∣tue, as neither worme, nor water peirceth it; neither hath the Sunne power against it.</P>
<P>Some haue devised a certaine Pitch, mingled with Glasse, and o∣ther ingredients, beaten into powder, with which if the Shippe be pitched, it is said, the worme that toucheth it, dyeth; but I haue not heard, that it hath beene vsefull.</P>
<P>But the most approved of all is the manner of sheathing vsed now adayes in <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>England</HI>▪</NOTE> with thin bourds, halfe inch thicke; the thinner the better; and Elme better then Oake; for it ryveth not, it indureth better vnder water, and yeeldeth better to the Shippes side.</P>
<P>The invention of the materialles incorporated betwixt the planke and the sheathing, is that indeed which avayleth; for without it many plankes were not sufficient to hinder the entrance of this worme; this manner is thus:</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="44"/>Before the sheathing board is nayled on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Best manner of sheathing.</NOTE> vpon the inner side of it they smere it over with tarre halfe a finger thicke, and vpon the tarre, another halfe finger thicke of hayre, such as the Whitelymers vse, and so nayle it on, the nayles not aboue a spanne distance one from another; the thicker they are driven, the better.</P>
<P>Some hold opinion, that the tarre killeth the worme; others, that the worme passing the sheathing, and seeking a way through, the hayre and the tarre so involue him, that he is choked therewith; which me thinkes is most probable; this manner of sheathing was invented by my Father; and experience hath taught it to be the best, and of least cost.</P>

<P>To which, I never spake word till I saw it resolved; being my part rather to learne, then to advise. But seeing the fatall sentence given, and suspecting that the Captaine made the matter worse then it was, rather vpon pollicy to come into another Ship, which was better of Sayle, then for any danger they might runne into. With as much reason as my capacitie could reach vnto, I disswa∣ded my Vnkle privately; And vrged, that seeing wee had profited the Adventurers nothing, wee should endevour to preserue our principall; especially, having men and victualls. But seeing I pre∣vayle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not, I went further, and offered to finde out in the same Shippe, and others, so many men, as with me would be content to carry her home, giving vs the third part of the value of the ship, as shee should be valued at, at her returne, by foure indifferent per∣sons; and to leaue the Vice-admirall, which I had vnder my charge, and to make her Vice-admirall.</P>
<P>Whereupon, it was condescended, that we should all goe aboard the Shippe, and that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it should be determined. The Captaine thought himselfe somewhat touched in Reputation, and so would not that further triall should be made of the matter; Saying, that if another man was able to carry the Shippe into <HI>England,</HI> he would in no case leaue her; neither would he forsake her till shee sunke vnder him.</P>

<P>But the Mariner is ordinarily so carried away with the desire of Pillage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wilfulnesse of Mariners.</NOTE> as sometimes for very appearances of small moment, hee looseth his voyage, and many times himselfe.

<P><PB N="101" REF="54"/>This night, I set a good guard in all the shippes, longing to see the light of the next morning, to put all things in order; which ap∣pearing, I began to survay them, and found nothing of moment, saue fiue hundreth Botozios of Wine, two or three thousand of Hennes, and some refreshing of Bread, Bacon, dried Beefe, Waxe, Candles, and other necessaries. The rest of their lading was plankes, Spares, and Tymber, for <HI>Lyma,</HI> and the valleyes, which is a rich trade; for it hath no Tymber, but that which is brought to it from other places. They had also many Packes of <HI>Indian</HI> Mantles, (but of no value vnto vs) with much Tallow, and <HI>Manteca de Puerco,</HI> and aboundance of great new Chests, in which wee had thought to be some great masse of wealth, but opening them, found nothing but Apples therein; all which was good Marchandize in <HI>Lyma,</HI> but to vs of small accompt. The Marchandize on shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the ware∣houses.</NOTE> in their Store-houses was the like, and therefore in the same predicament. The owners of the Shippes gaue vs to vnderstand, that at a reasona∣ble price they would redeeme their Shippes and loading, which I harkened vnto; and so admitted certaine persons which might treat of the matter, and concluded with them for a small price, rather then to burne them, saving for the greatest, which I carryed with me, more to giue satisfaction to my people, then for any other re∣spect; because they would not be perswaded, but that there was much Gold hidden in her; otherwise shee would haue yeelded vs more then the other three.</P>
<P>Being in this treatie, one morning, at the breake of day, came ano∣ther Shippe touring into the Harbour, and standing into the shore, but was becalmed. Against her we manned a couple of Boates, and tooke her before many houres.

And for that shee had brought vs so good a portion, and her owner continued with vs, the better to animate him to play the honest man (though we tru∣sted him no further then we saw him, for we presently discovered him to be a cunning fellow) and for that his other partner had lost the greatest part of Gold, and seemed to be an honest man, as after he prooved by his thankefulnesse, in <HI>Lyma</HI>; we gaue them the ship, and the greatest part of her loading freely.</P>

<P>Another that treated with me was Captaine <HI>Ivan Contreres,</HI> ow∣ner of one of the Shippes, and of the Iland <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> in thirtie seaven degrees and fortie minutes.

A drunkard is vnfit for any government, and if I might be hired with many thousands, I would not carry with me a man knowne to put his felicitie in that vice, instiling it with the name of good fellowship; which in most well governed Common-wealths, hath beene a sufficient blemish to depriue a man of office, of honour, and estimation.

<P>And though I am not old, in comparison of other auncient men, I can remember Spanish wine rarely to be found in this Kingdome.

To confirme which my beliefe, I haue heard one of our learnedst Phy∣sitians affirme, that he thought there died more persons in <HI>England</HI> of drinking Wine, and vsing hot Spices in their meats and drinkes, then of all other diseases.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> League or better before a man discover this Bay to the South-wards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Bay.</NOTE> lyeth a great Rocke, or small Iland, neere the shore; vnder which, for a need, a man may ride with his Shippe. It is a good marke, and sure signe of the Port, and discovering the Bay a man must giue a good birth to the poynt of the Harbour; for it hath perilous Rockes lying a good distance off. It neither ebbeth nor floweth in this Port, nor from this, till a man come to <HI>Guayaquill,</HI> which is three degrees from the Equinoctiall lyne to the South-wards; Let this be considered. It is a good Harbour for all windes, that par∣take not of the North; for it runneth vp South and by West, and South South-west, but it hath much fowle ground.</P>
<P>In one of these Shippes wee found a new devise for the stopping of a sodaine Leake in a Shippe vnder water, without board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new devise for stopping a Leake with∣out board.</NOTE> when a man cannot come to it within board; which eased vs of one, that we had from the day we departed from <HI>Detford,</HI> caused by the touching a-ground of our Shippe at low water, being loaden, and in the neape streames, comming a-ground in the sterne, the force of the tyde caused to cast thwart, wrested her slegg, and that in such sort, as it made a continuall Leake, though not much. And for that others may profit themselues of the like, I thinke it good to set downe the manner of it; which was, taking a round wicker Basket, and to fill it with peeces of a Iunke or Rope, chopped ve∣ry small, and of an inch long, and after tozed all as Oacombe;

then the Basket is to be covered with a Nett, the meshes of it be∣ing at the least two inches square, and after to be tied to a long Pike or Pole, which is to goe a crosse the Baskets mouth▪ and putting it vnder water, care is to be had to keepe the Baskets mouth towardes the Shippes side; if the Leake be any thing great, the Oacombe may be somewhat longer, and it carrieth likelihood to doe good, &amp; seemeth to be better then the stitching of a Bonnet, or any other diligence, which as yet I haue seene.</P>
<P>Another thing I noted of these Shippes, which would be also vsed by vs; that every Shippe carrieth with her a spare Rudder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spare Rud∣ders.</NOTE> and they haue them to hange and vnhange with great facilitie: and besides, in some part of the Shippe, they haue the length, breadth, and proportion of the Rudder marked out, for any mischance that may befall them; which is a very good prevention.</P>
<P>Tenne leagues to the North-wards of this Harbour, is the bay of <HI>Quintera,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay of <HI>Quin∣tera.</HI></NOTE> where is good anchoring, but an open bay; where master <HI>Thomas Candish</HI> (for the good he had done to a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> in bringing him out of the Straits of <HI>Magellan,</HI> where, otherwise,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nota verum hispanum.</HI></NOTE> he had perished with his company) was by him betrayed, and a dozen of his men taken and slaine: But the iudgement of God left not his ingratitude vnpunished; for, in the fight with vs, in the Vice-admirall, he was wounded and maymed in that manner, as three yeares after, I saw him begge with Crutches, and in that miserable estate, as he had beene better dead, then aliue.</P>

birth from the shore; and these are the markes of the Port as I remember.</P>
<P>Being cleere of this Port, wee shaped our course for <HI>Arica,</HI> and leaft the Kingdomes of <HI>Chily,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arica</HI> in <HI>Chily,</HI> much com∣mended.</NOTE> one of the best Countries that the Sunne shineth on: for it is of a temperate clymate, and abounding in all things necessary, for the vse of man, with infinite rich mines of Gold, Copper, and sundry other mettals.</P>

<P>The Gold they gather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And plenty of Gold.</NOTE> is in two manners; the one is washing the earth in great Trayes of wood in many waters; as the earth wasteth away, the Gold in the bottome remaineth. The other is, by force of Art, to draw it out of the Mynes, in which they finde it. In most partes of the Countrie, the earth is mingled with Gold; for the Bu∣tizias (in which the Wine was) which wee found in <HI>Balpharizo,</HI> had many sparkes of Gold shining in them. Of it the Gold-smiths I carryed with me (for like purposes) made experience.</P>
<P>When <HI>Baldivia</HI> and <HI>Arawca</HI> were peaceable, they yeelded grea∣test plentie, and the best: but now, their greatest Mynes are in <HI>Coquinbo</HI>; as also the Mines of Copper, which they carry to the <HI>Peru,</HI> and sell it better cheape, then it is ordinarily sold in <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>

Thus incouraged he them to fight for their liues, limbes, and libertie, choosing rather to die an honourable death fighting, then to liue in servitude, as fruitlesse members in
<PB N="108" REF="58"/>
their Common-wealth. Thus, vsing the office of a Sergeant Maior, and having loaden his two stumpes with bundles of Arrowes, suc∣coured those, who in the succeeding battaile had their store wasted, and changing himselfe from place to place, animated and encoura∣ged his Countri-men, with such comfortable perswasions, as it is reported, and credibly beleeved, that he did much more good with his words, and presence, without striking a stroake, then a great part of the Armie did with fighting to the vtmost.</P>
<P>The other proofe is, that such of them as fight on horsebacke, are but slightly armed, for that their armour is a Beasts hide, fitted to their bodie, greene, and after worne till it be dry and hard. He that it is best armed, hath him double; yet any one of them with these Armes, and with his Launce, will fight hand to hand with any <HI>Spa∣niar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> armed from head to foote. And it is credibly reported, that an <HI>Indian</HI> being wounded through the body by a <HI>Spaniards</HI> Launce, with his owne hands hath crept on vpon the Launce, and come to grapple with his adversary, and both fallen to the ground together. By which is seene their resolution and invincible courage, and the desire they haue to maintaine their reputation and libertie.</P>

<P>And therefore in election of Chieftaines, care would be had in examination of this poynt. The shamefull fruites whereof (found by experience of many yeares, wherein I haue wandred the world) I leaue to touch in particular; because I will not diminish the re∣putation of any. But this let me manifest, that there haue bin and are certaine persons, who, before they goe to Sea, either robbe part of the provisions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mischiefs of corrupt, or scant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e provi∣sions.</NOTE> or in the buying, make penurious, vnholsome, and avaritious penny-worths; and the last I hold to be the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; for they robbe onely the Victuallers and owners, but the others steale from owners, victuallers, and companie, and are many times the onely overthrowers of the Voyage; for the company thinking themselues to be stored with foure or sixe moneths Victualls, vpon survay, they find their Bread, Beefe, or Drinke short, yea, perhappes all, and so are forced to seeke home in time of best hopes, and imployment. This mischiefe is most ordinary in great actions.</P>
<P>Lastly, some are so cunning, that they not onely make their voy∣age by robbing before they goe to Sea, but o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that also which commeth home. Such gamsters, a wise man of our Nation resem∣bled to the Mill on the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> for Grinding both with flood and ebbe; So, these at their going out, and comming home, will be sure to robbe all others of their shares: although this be a great abuse amongst vs, and but of late dayes practised, and by me spoken vnto by way of animadversion, either in hope of redresse, or for infliction of punishment; yet I would haue the world know, that in other Countries, the fault is farre more insufferable. And the principall cause which I can finde for it, is that our Country imployeth her Nobles, of men of credite in all actions of moment, who rather chuse to spend wealth, and gaine honor, then to gaine riches without reputation; whereas in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and other partes, the advancement of poore men and meane persons by favour and inte∣rest
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>
produceth no other end, but private and particular respects, to enrich themselues, yet the Nobilitie themselues (for the most part) in all occasions pretend rewards for any small service whatsoever, which with vs as yet is not in vse.</P>
<P>But the greatest and most principall Robbery of all, in my opi∣nion, is the defrauding, or detaining of the Companies thirdes or wages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of detayning and def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>au∣ding of wages.</NOTE> accursed by the iust God, who forbiddeth the hyre of the labourer to sleepe with vs. To such I speake as either abuse them∣selues in detayning it; or else to such as force the poore man to sell it at vile and low prices; and lastly to such as vpon fained cavils and sutes, doe deterre the simple and ignorant sort from their due pro∣secutions; which being too much in vse amongst vs, hath bred in those that follow the Sea a iealousie in all imployments, and many times causeth mutenies and infinite inconveniences. A poynt de∣serving consideration and reformation, and which with great faci∣litie may be remedied, if vpright justice would put it selfe as stickler betwixt the owners and Company.</P>
<P>No lesse worthie of reformation are the generall abuses of Marri∣ners and Souldiers, who robbe all they can, vnder the colour of Pillage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of marriners by challenge of Pillage.</NOTE> and after make Ordinance, Cables, Sayles, Anchors, and all aboue Deckes, to belong vnto them of right, whether they goe by thirdes or wages; this proceedeth from those pilfering warres, wherein every Gallant that can arme out a Shippe, taketh vpon him the name and office of a Captaine, not knowing what to com∣mand, nor what to execute. Such Commanders for the most part consort and ioyne vnto themselues disorderly persons, Pyrates, and Ruffians, vnder the title of men of valour and experience: they meeting with any Prise, make all vpon the Deckes theirs of dutie; <HI>viz.</HI> the best peece of Ordinance for the Captaine; the second, for the Gunner; the third, for his Mate; the best Cable and Anchor for the Master; the Maine topsayle, for the Botesman, the bonnetts, for the quarter Masters; and the rest of the Sayles for the company: The Cardes and Instruments of the Master, for the Master; the Sur∣geans Instruments and Chest, for the Surgean; the Carpenters Tooles and Chest for the Carpenter; and so consequently of each officer, that answereth the other in the two Shippes.</P>
<P>If one happen vpon a bag of Gold, Silver, Pearle, or precious Stones, it is held well gotten; provided it be cleanly stolne, though the Shippe, and all her loading besides be not worth so much, lit∣tle considering the common iniury, in defrauding the owners, victuallers, and whole Companie: and forgetting, that if himselfe were a jury-man vpon another in like case, he would adiudge him
<PB N="111" REF="59"/>
to the Gallows. But I would advise such Novices to know, that our true and auncient Discipline of Warre is farre different, and being vnderstood, is much more better for the generall. Besides, it is grounded on Gods law (from whence all Lawes should be derived) and true justice, which distributeth to every one that which to him belongeth of right, and that in due season.</P>
<P>In the time of warre in our Countrey, as also in others, by the lawes of <HI>Oleron</HI> (which to our auncient Sea-men were fundamen∣tall) nothing is allowed for Pillage but Apparell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lawes of <HI>Oleron,</HI> con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣ning pillage.</NOTE> Armes, Instru∣ments, and other necessaries belonging to the persons, in that shippe which is taken; and these too, when the shippe is gained by dint of sword; with a proviso, that if any perticular pillage, ex∣ceede the valew of sixe crownes, it may bee redeemed for that valew, by the generall stocke, and sould for the common bene∣fit.</P>
<P>If the prise render it selfe without forcible entry, all in gene∣rall ought to be preserved and sould in masse, and so equally de∣vided: yea though the shippe bee wonne by force and entry, yet whatsoever belongeth to her of tackling, sayles, or Ordinance, is to bee preserved for the generalitie: saving a peece of Artillery for the Captaine; another for the Gunner, and a Cable and An∣chor for the Master, which are the rights due vnto them; and these to be delivered, when the shippe is in safety, and in Har∣bour, eyther vnloaden or sould: which law or custome well con∣sidered, will rise to be more beneficiall for the owners, victuallars, and company; then the disorders newly crept in and before re∣membred.</P>
<P>For the Sayles, Cables, Anchors, and hull, being sould (eve∣ry one a part) yeelde not the one halfe, which they would doe, if they were sould altogether, besides the excusing of charges, and robberies in the vnloading and parting.</P>
<P>In the warres of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> in the time of Queene <HI>Mary,</HI> and in other warres (as I haue heard of many auncient Captaines) the Companie had but the fourth part, and every man bound to bring with him the Armes, with which hee would fight: which in our time, I haue knowne also vsed in <HI>Fraunce;</HI> and if the Company victualed themselues, they had then the one halfe, and the ow∣ners the other halfe for the Shippe, powder, shott, and munition. If any prise were taken, it was sould by the Tunne, shippe and goods, so as the loading permitted it; that the Marchant having bought the goods, hee might presently tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>port them whether∣soever he would; By this manner of proceeding, all rested con∣tented,
<PB N="112" REF="60"/>
all being truely payd; for this was iust dealing; if any deserved reward, he was recompensed out of the generall stocke; If any one had filched or stolne, or committed offence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hee had likewise his desert: And who once was knowne, to be a disorde∣red person, or a theefe, no man would receiue him into his shippe, whereas now a dayes many vaunt themselues of their theftes and disorders; yea I haue seene the common sort of Mariners, vnder the name of pillage, maintaine and iustifie their robberies most insolently, before the Queenes Maiesties commissioners, with arrogant and vnseemely termes, for that they would not condi∣scend to their vnreasonable challenges: The demaunds being better worth then fiue hundreth poundes, which some one pre∣tended to be his; and that of the choysest Marchandize, and most of it robbed out of that part of the shippe, which they themselues, and all the world cannot but confesse to be Marchandize.</P>
<P>My opinion is, that such Malaperts, deserue most iustly to haue their spoyle taken from them, or some worse consideration, and afterwards to be severely punished, in prevention of greater pre∣iudices, then can by paper be well declared.</P>
<P>But I must tell you withall (such hath beene the partiallitie of some Commissioners in former times) that vpon information, in lieu of punishment, Opinion hath held them for tall fellowes, when, in truth, they never proue the best men in difficult occasions. For their mindes are all set on spoyle, and can bee well contented to suffer their associates to beare the brunt, whillest they are prol∣ling after pillage, the better to gaine and mainetaine the aforesayd attributes, in Tavernes, and disorderly places.</P>
<P>For the orderly and quiet men, I haue ever found in all occa∣sions to bee of best vse, most valiant, and of greatest sufficiency. Yet I condemne none: but those who will bee reputed valiant, and are not, examine the accusation.</P>
<P>All what soever is found vpon the decke, going for Marchan∣dize, is exempted out of the censure of pillage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What ought to be reputed pillage.</NOTE> Silkes, Linnen, or woollen cloth in whole peeces, apparell, that goeth to be sold, or other goods what soever (though they be in remnants,) manifest∣ly knowne to be carryed for that end; or being comprehended in the Register, or bils of lading, are not to bee contayned vn∣der the name of pillage.</P>
<P>But as I haue sayd of the consort, so can I not but complaine of many Captaines and Governours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against the disloyalties of Captaines.</NOTE> who overcome with like gree∣die desire of gaine, condiscend to the smoothering and suppressing of this auncient discipline, the cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lier to smother their owne

<P>Some of these cause the bils of lading to bee cast into the Sea, or so to bee hidden, that they never appeare. Others send away their prisoners, who sometimes are more worth then the shippe and her lading, because they should not discover their secret stolne treasure; for many times, that which is leaft out of the Re∣gister or bils of lading, (with purpose to defraud the Prince of his Customes, (in their conceits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>emē<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much more value, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Trad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng.</NOTE> held to be excessiue) is of much more value, then that which the shippe and lading is worth. Yea I haue knowne shippes worth two hundreth thousand pounds, and bet∣ter, cleane swept of their principall riches, nothing but the bare bulke being leaft vnsacked. The like may be spoken, of that which the disorderly Marriner, and the Souldier termeth pillage; yet all winked at, and vnpunished, although such prizes haue beene rendred without stroake stricken.</P>
<P>This doubtlesse, cannot but be an hearts greife and discourage∣ment to all those who vertuously, and truely desire to obserue the auncient discipline of our Nation, their owne honours, and the service of their Soveraigne.</P>
<P>But to prevent these vnknowne mischiefes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The preven∣tion of vndue pillagin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE> (and for his better discharge) I remember, that my Father Sir <HI>Iohn Hawkins</HI> in his in∣structions, in actions vnder his charge, had this particular Article; That whosoever rendred, or tooke any shippe, should be bound to exhibite the bils of lading; to keepe the Captaine, Master, Mar∣chants, and persons of account, and to bring them to him to be examined, or into <HI>England</HI>; If they should bee by any accident seperated from him, what soever was found wanting (the priso∣ners being examined) was to bee made good by the Captaine, and Company, which tooke the shippe, and this vpon great pu∣nishments. I am witnes, and avow, that this course did redownd much to the benefitt of the generall stocke; to the satisfaction of her Maiestie, and Counsell; the iustification of his governement, and the content of his followers.</P>
<P>Thus much haue I set downe concerning these abuses, and the reformation thereof, for that, I haue neither seene them divulged by any, with whom I haue gone to Sea, neither yet recorded in writing, by any mans pen; let consideration, present them to the eares of the powerfull; But now to our Voyage.</P>

note in this place, that others may take warning by his harme.</P>
<P>The cause of the Muskets breaking, was the charging with two bullets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overcha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Artileries.</NOTE> the powder being ordayned to carry but the waight of one, and the Musket not to suffer two charges of powder or shott.

<P>And I am of opinion, that it is a great errour, to proue great Ordinance, or small shot, with double charges of powder, or shot, my reason is, for that ordinarily the mettall is proportioned to the waight of the shot, which the Peece is to beare, and the powder correspondent to the waight of the bullet: and this being graun∣ted, I see no reason why any man should require to proue his peece with more, then is belonging to it of right: for I haue seene ma∣ny goodly peeces broken with such tryals, being cleane without hony combes, cracke, flawe, or other perceavable blemish, which no doubt, with their ordinary allowance would haue served ma∣ny yeares. Yea I haue beene certified by men of credit, that some Gunners haue taken a glory, for breaking many peeces in the tryall: which is easie to be done by sundry slights and meanes not fitt to bee published, much lesse to bee exercised, being pre∣iudiciall to the seller, and chargeable to the Conscience of the practiser, therefore it were good, this excessiue tryall by double charges were cleane abolished. If I shoulde make choyce for my selfe, I would not willingly, that any peece should come into Fort, or Shippe, (vnder my charge) which had borne at any time more then his ordinary allowance, misdoubting, least, through the violence of the double charge, the Peece may bee crased within, or so forced, as at another occasion, with his ordinary allowance he might breake in peeces: how many men so many mindes: for to others, this may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeme harsh, for that the contrary custome hath so long time beene received, and therefore I submit to better expe∣rience, and contradict not but that in a demy Culvering, a man may put two Saker or Minion shots, or many of smaller waight: and so in a Muskett, two Calever shott, or many smaller, so they exceede not the ordinary waight, prescribed by proportion, Arte; and experience.

<P>The day appearing, we began to weigh our Anchors, and being a Pike ready to cut sayle, one, out of the toppe, descryed the Spanish Armado,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spanis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Arma∣do.</NOTE> comming about the Cape: which by the course it kept, presently gaue vs to vnderstand, who they were: though my company (as is the custome of Sea men,) made them to be the Fleete bound for <HI>Panama,</HI> loden with treasure, and importuned, that in all hast, we should cut sayle &amp; stand with them, which I con∣tradicted, for that, I was assured, that no shipping would stirre vp∣pon the coast, till they had securitie of our departure (except some Armado, that might be sent to seeke vs,) and that it was not the time of the yeare to carry the treasure to <HI>Panama.</HI> And besides in Riding still at an Anchor, they euer came neerer vnto vs; for they stood directly with vs, and we kept the weather gage; where if we had put our selues vnder sayle (the ebbe in hand) we should haue giuen them the aduantage, which we had in our power, by reason of the point of the Bay. And being the Armado (as it was) we gai∣ned time to fit our selues, the better to fight. And truly (as before, to a stiffe-necked horse,) so now againe, I cannot but resemble the condition of the Marriner to any thing better, then to the current of a furious Riuer, repressed by force or art, which neuerthelesse ceaseth not to seeke a way to ouerthrow both fence and banke: Euen so the common sort of Sea-men, apprehending a conceite in their imaginations, neither experiment, knowledge, examples, reasons nor authority can alter or remoove them from their con∣ceited opinions. In this extremitie, with reason I laboured to conuince them, and to contradict their pretences; But they alto∣gether without reason, or against reason, breake out, some into vaunting and bragging, some into reproaches of want of courage, others into wishings, that they had neuer come out of their coun∣trey,

To some I turned the deafe eare, with others I dissembled, and armed my selfe with patience (hauing no other defence nor remedie for that occasion) soothing and ani∣mating them to the execution of what they promised, and perswa∣ded them to haue a little sufferance, seeing they gained time, and aduantage by it.</P>
<P>And to giue them better satisfaction I condiscended, that our Captaine with a competent number of men, should with our Pin∣nace goe to discouer them; with order, that they should not engage themselues in that manner, as they might not be able to come vnto vs, or we to succour them. In all these divisions and opinions, our Master <HI>Hugh Dormish</HI> (who was a most sufficient man for gouern∣ment and valour, and well saw the errors of the multitude) vsed his office, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> became him; and so did all those of best vnderstanding.</P>
<P>In short space, our Pinnace discouered what they were, and ca∣sting about to returne vnto vs, the Vice-admirall (being next her) began with her chace to salute her with three or foure peeces of Artilery, and so continued chasing her, and gunning at her.

<P>And that we might haue Sea-roome to fight, we presently weigh∣ed Anchor, and stood off to Sea with all our sayles, in hope to get the weather gage of our contraries. But the winde scanting with vs, and larging with them, we were forced to leeward. And the Admirall weathering vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin∣ning of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight.</NOTE> came rome vpon vs: which being within Musket shott, we hayled first with our noise of Trumpets, then with our Waytes, and after with our Artilery: which they answered with Artilery; two for one.

For my part, I, with the rest of our Officers, occupied our selues in clee∣ring our deckes, laceing our nettings, making of Bulwarkes, ar∣ming our toppes, fitting our wast-cloathes, tallowing our pikes, slinging our yards, doubling our sheetes, and tackes, placing and ordering our people, and procuring that they should be well fitted and prouided of all things; leauing the Artilery, and other instru∣ments of fire, to the Gunners dispose and order, with the rest of his Mates and adherents: which (as I said) was part of our perdition.

For this we have no excuse, and therefore could not avoyde the danger, to charge and discharge with the ladell, especially in so hotte a fight. And comming now to put in execution the sinking of the shippe, as he promised, he seemed a man without life or soule. So the Ad∣mirall comming close vnto vs, I my selfe, and the Master of our Shippe, were forced to play the Gunners.</P>

Some of our Company had him in suspition, to be more friend to the Spa∣niards, then to vs; for that he had served some yeares in the <HI>Ter∣cera,</HI> as Gunner, and that he did all this of purpose. Few of our peeces were cleere, when we came to vse them, and some had the

shott first put in, and after the powder. Besides, after our surrendry; it was laid to his charge, that he should say; he had a brother that served the King in the <HI>Peru,</HI> and that he thought he was in the Ar∣mado; and how he would not for all the world, he should be slaine. Whether this were true or no, I know not, but I am sure all in ge∣nerall gave him an ill report, and that he, in whose hands the chiefe execution of the whole fight consisted, executed nothing as was promised and expected.</P>

Our con∣traries, towards the euening, determined the third time to lay vs abourd, with resolution to take vs, or to hazard all.

<P>The Captaine of the Viceadmirall, being more hardy then con∣siderate, and presuming with his shippe and company to get the price, and chiefe honour; wayted not the time to put in execution the direction giuen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spaniards pay deerely for their rash∣nesse.</NOTE> but presently came abourd to wind wards vp∣pon our broad side. Which doubtlesse was the great and especiall providence of Almightie God, for the discouraging of our ene∣mies,

and animating of vs. For although shee was as long, or ra∣ther longer then our shippe, being rarely built, and vtterly without fights or defence; what with our Muskets, and what with our fire∣works we cleered her deckes in a moment; so that scarce any person appeared. And doubtlesse if we had entred but a dozen men, we might haue enforced them to haue rendred vnto vs, or taken her, but our company being few, and the principall of them slaine, or hurt, we durst not, neither was it wisedome, to aduenture the separation of those, which remained: and so held that for the best and soundest resolution, to keepe our forces together in defence of our owne.</P>
<P>The Viceadmirall seeing himselfe in great distresse, called to his Admirall for succour: who presently laid him abourd, and entred a hundreth of his men, and so cleered themselues of vs.</P>
<P>In this bourding the Viceadmirall had at the least thirtie and sixe men hurt, and slaine; and amongst them his Pilote shot through the body, so as he dyed presently. And the Admirall also receiued some losse; which wrought in them a new resolution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And take a new resolution</NOTE> only with their Artillery to batter vs; and so with time to force vs to surren∣der, or to sinke vs; which they put in execution; and placing themselues within a Musket shott of our weather quarter, and sometimes on our broad side, lay continually beating vpon vs with∣out intermission; which was doubtlesse the best and securest de∣termination they could take, for they being rare shippes, and with∣out any manner of close fights, in bourding with vs, their men were all open vnto vs, and we vnder couert and shelter. For on all parts our shippe was Musket free, and the great Artillery of force must cease on either side (the shippes bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g once grapled together) except we resolued to sacrifice our selues together in fire. For it is impossible, if the great Ordinance play (the shippes being bour∣ded) but that they must set fire on the shippe they shoote at; and then no surety can be had to free himselfe, as experience daily con∣firmeth. For a peece of Artillery most properly resembleth a thun∣derclap, which breaking vpwards, or on the side, hurteth not; for that the fire hath scope to dispence it selfe without finding resi∣stance, till the violence which forceth it taketh end, and so it mounts to its center: but breaking downe right or stooping down∣wards, and finding resistance or impediment (before the violence that forceth it take end, being so subtill and penetrable a substance) passeth and pierceth so wonderfully, as it leaueth the effect of his execution in all points answerable to his leuell and nighnesse. For if the clouds be nigh the earth (as some are higher, some lower) and
<PB N="137" REF="72"/>
breake down-wards, the violence wherewith the fire breaketh out is such, and of so strange an execution, that men haue beene found dead, without any outward signe in their flesh, and yet all their bones burnt to dust. So the blade of the sword hath beene found broken all to peeces in the scabard, and the scabard whole with∣out blemish: And a cristall glasse all shiuered in peeces, his couer and case remaining sound, which commeth to passe, for that in the flesh, in the scabard, and in the case, the fire being so subtile of nature, findeth easie passage without resistance, but the bones, the blade, the Cristall, being of substance more solide, maketh greater resistance, and so the fire with the more fury worketh the more his execution in its obiects. As was seene in the Spanish Admirall (or Captaine) after my imprisonment, crossing from <HI>Panama</HI> to Cape <HI>San Francisco,</HI> a Rayo (for so the Spaniards call a thund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣clappe) brake ouer our shippe, killed one in the fore-toppe, astoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h∣ed either two or three in the shroudes, and split the Mast in strange manner; where it entred, it could hardly be descerned, but where it came forth, it draue out a great splinter before it; and the man slaine, was cleane in a manner without signe or token of hurt, al∣though all his bones turned to powder, and those who liued, and recouered, had all their bodies blacke, as burnt with fire, which plainly declareth and confirmeth that aboue said, and may serue to iudge in such occasions of persons hurt with thunder: for if they complaine of their bones, and haue little signe of the fire, their hazard of death is the greater, then when the fire hath left greater impressions outward. The fire out of a cloude worketh like effect only, where it leveleth directly, as experience daily teacheth; killing those who are opposite, hurting those who are neere, And only terrifying those who are further di∣stant.</P>
<P>In like manner the peece of Ordinance hurteth not those which stand aside, nor those which stand a slope from his mouth, but those alone which stand directly against the true point of his levell: though sometimes the winde of the shott ouerthroweth one, and the splin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers (being accidents) mayne and hurt others. But prin∣cipally where the peece doth resemble the thunderclappe, as when the shippes are bourded. For then, although the Artillery be discharged without shott, the fury of the fire, and his piercing nature is such, as it entreth by the seames, and all parts of the ships sides, and meeting with so fit matter as Pitch, Tarre, Ocombe, and sometimes with powder, presently conuerteth all into flames.</P>
<P>For auoyding whereof, as also the danger and damage which
<PB N="138" REF="73"/>
may come by pikes and other inventions of fire, and if any shippe be oppressed with many shippes at once, and subiect by them to be bourded; I hold it a good course to strike his fire and mayne yards close to his decke, and to fight with sprit-saile, and myson, and top-sayles loose: so shall he be able to hinder them from op∣pressing him.</P>
<P>Some haue thought it a good pollicy to launce out some ends of Mastes or yards by the ports or other parts:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pollicies to a¦voyde bour∣dings.</NOTE> but this is to be v∣sed in the greater shippes, for in the lesser, though they be neuer so strong, the waight of the bigger will beate out the opposite sides, and doe hurt, and make great spoyle in the lesser. And in bour∣ding, ordinarily the lesser shippe hath all the harme, which the one shippe can doe vnto the other.</P>
<P>Here is offered to speake of a point much canvassed amongst Carpenters, and Sea Captaines, diversly maintained, but yet vn∣determined: that is, whether the race or loftie built shippe, bee best for the Merchant, and those which imploy themselues in tra∣ding:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispute con∣cerning ships of Trade.</NOTE> I am of opinion, that the race shippe is most conuenient; yet so, as that every perfect shippe ought to haue two deckes, for the better strengthening of her; the better succouring of her peo∣ple; the better preseruing of her Merchandize and victuall, and for her greater safetie from sea and stormes.</P>
<P>But for the Princes shippes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning the Prince his shippes.</NOTE> and such as are imployed continual∣ly in the warres, to be built loftie I hold very necessary for many reasons. First for Maiestie and terrour of the enemy; secondly, for harbouring of many men; thirdly for accommodating more men to fight; fourthly, for placing and vsing more Artillery; fift∣ly, for better strengthening and securing of the shippe, sixtly for ouertopping and subiecting the enemy; seuenthly, for greater safe∣gard and defence of the ship and company. For it is plaine, that the ship with three deckes, or with two and a halfe, shewes more pomp then another of her burthen with a decke and halfe, or two deckes, and breedeth greater terror to the enemy, discouering her selfe to be a more powerfull ship as she is, then the other; which being indeed a ship of force, seemeth to be but a Barke, and with her low building hideth her burthen. And who doubteth, that a decke and a halfe cannot harbour that proportion of men, that two deckes, and two deckes and a halfe can accommodate to fight; Nor carry the Artillery so plentifully, nor so commodiously. Nei∣ther can the ship be so strong with a decke and a halfe, as with two deckes, nor with two, as with three; nor carry her Mastes so taunt; nor spread so great a clue; nor contriue so many fightes, to answer
<PB N="139" REF="73"/>
one another, for defence and offence. And the aduantage the one hath of the other, experience daily teacheth.</P>
<P>In the great expedition of eightie eight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Al ships of warre are not to below bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt</NOTE> did not the <HI>Elizabeth Ionas,</HI> the <HI>Triumph,</HI> and the <HI>Beare,</HI> shew greater maiestie then the <HI>Arke Royall</HI> and the <HI>Victorie,</HI> being of equall burthens? did they not cause greater regard in the enemy? did they not harbour and accommodate more then men? and much better? did they not beare more Artillery? And if they had come to boord with the Spanish high-charged ships, it is not to be doubted but they would haue mustred themselues better, then those which could not with their prowesse nor props, haue reached to their wastes. The strength of the one cannot be compared with the strength of the other: but in bourding, it goeth not so much in the strength, as in weight and greatnesse. For the greater ship that bourdeth with the lesser; with her Mastes, her Yards, her Tacklings, her Anchors, her Ordinance, and with her sides bruseth and beateth the lesser to peeces, although the lesser be farre stronger according to propor∣tion.</P>

(For she had in a man∣ner no strong building nor binding, and the others were strengthe∣ned and bound, as art was able to affoord;) and yet both bour∣ding with her, were so brused, broken, and badly hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, as they had like to haue sunke by her side, though bourding with aduan∣tage to weather-wards of her. But what would haue become of them, if she should haue had the wind of them, and haue come a∣boord to windward of them? In small time no doubt, she would haue beaten them vnder water.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 90. in the fleet vnder the charge of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Iohn Hawkins</HI> my father, cōming from the South-wards, the <HI>Hope</HI> of his Maiesties gaue chase to a French ship, thinking her to be a Spaniard. She thought to haue freed her selfe by her sailing, and so would not auaile, but en∣dured the <HI>shooting</HI> of many peeces, and forced the <HI>Hope</HI> to lay her abourd; of which issued that mischiefe which before I spake off. For in a moment the French ship had all her Mastes, Yards, and Sailes in the Sea; and with great difficultie the <HI>Hope</HI> could free her selfe from sinking her.</P>
<P>In the selfe same voyage, neere the Ilands of <HI>Flores</HI> and <HI>Corvo,</HI> the <HI>Raine-bow</HI> and the <HI>Fore-sight</HI> came foule one of another, the <HI>Rain-bow</HI> (being the greater shippe) left the <HI>Fore-sight</HI> much torne; and if God had not beene pleased to seperate them, the lesser
<PB N="140" REF="74"/>
(doubtlesse) had sunke in the Sea: bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in these incounters, they received little or no hurt. The boord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of the <HI>Raine-bow</HI> and <HI>Fore-sight,</HI> (as I was enformed) proceeded of the obstinacie and selfe will of the Captaine or Master of the <HI>Fore-sight,</HI> who would not set Sayle in time, to giue Sea-roome to the other, comming driuing vpon her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perticular re∣spects must giue place to the Generall.</NOTE> for that shee was more flotie. This pride I haue seene many times to be the cause of great hurt, and is worthy of seuere punishment: for being all of one Company, and bound e∣uery one to helpe and further the good of the other, as members of one bodie, their ought to be no strayning of courtesie, but all are bound to suppresse emulation and particular respect, in see∣king the generall good of all, yea of euery particular more inge∣niously, then that of his owne.</P>
<P>But in equitie and reason, the le-ward shippe ought euer to giue way to the weather most, in hulling, or trying, without any excep∣tion. First, for that shee <HI>aduantageth</HI> the other in hulling or trying: which is manifest, for that shee to wind-wards driues vpon her to le-wards. Secondly, for that the windermost shippe, by opening her sayle, may be vpon the other before shee be looked for, either for want of steeridge, not being vnder way, or by the rowling of the Sea, some one Sea casting the shippe more to le-wards then ten others. And thirdly, for that the windermost shippe being neere, and setting sayle, is in possibilitie to take away the winde from her to le-wards comming within danger. And this by way of Argu∣ment, for a hull and vnder-sayle in stormes and fayre weather, in Harbour, or at Sea.</P>
<P>Humanitie and courtesie are euer commendable and beneficiall to all, whereas arrogancie and ambition are euer accompanied with shame, losse and repentance.</P>
<P>And though in many examples (touching this point) I haue beene an eye witnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrogancy of a Spanish G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nerall.</NOTE> yet I will record but one, which I saw in the Riuer of <HI>Civill,</HI> at my comming out of the <HI>Indies</HI> amongst the Galleons loaden with siluer.

her to driue, and to dragge home her Anchors; and with that which over-lay ours, to cause vs to doe the like. Whereupon on both sides, was crying out, to veere cable: we for our part had lost all our Cables in the <HI>Terceras,</HI> sauing those which were a ground, and those very short, and vered to the better end. The Admirall strained courte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie, thinking the other (though loaden with siluer) bound to let slippe one, so to giue him way; and the Generall standing in his Gallery, saw the danger which both shippes ranne into, being in a manner bourd and bourd, and driuing vpon the point of the shoare: yet he commanded to hold fast, and not to vere Cable, till he was required and commanded in the Kings name, by the Captaine of our shippe; protesting, the damage (which should ensue thereof, to the King and Merchants) to runne vpon the Admirals accompt; and that in his shippe he had no o∣ther Cable, but those which were aground; And that they had vered as-much as they could: which the Generall knowing, and at last better considering, willed to vere his Cable end for end, and so with some difficultie and dispute, the punto was remedied, which if he had done at first, he had preuented all other danger, inconuenience, and dispute, by only weighing of his Cable and Anchor; after the gust was past, and letting it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all in a place more commodious: whereas his vaine-glory, stoutnesse, and selfe-will, had put in great perill two of the Kings shippes, and in them a∣boue two Millions of treasure. And it may be, if he had beene one of the ignorant Generals, (such as are sometimes imployed) where∣as he was one of best experience, I doubt not, but they would haue stood so much vpon their puntos, as rather then they would haue consented to vere theyr Cables, (for that it seemed a diminution of authoritie,) they would rather haue suffered all to goe to wracke, without discerning the danger and damage.</P>
<P>But to returne to my former point of aduantage, which the greater shippe hath of the lesser;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doubts and obiections re∣solued.</NOTE> I would haue it to be vnder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tood according to occasion, and to be vnderstood of ships of warre, with shippes of warre: It being no part of my meaning to maintaine, that a small man of warre, should not bourd with a great shippe, which goeth in trade.

<P>Yet discretion is euer to be vsed: for a man that in a small barke goeth to warre-fare is not bound to bourd with a Carake, nor with a shippe, which he seeth prouided with Artillery and other pre∣uentions farre aboue his possibilitie.</P>

<P>This imagination so vaine, and voyde of ground, hath growne from the ignorance of some of our common sort of Marriners, and vulgar people, which haue beene prisoners in <HI>Spaine:</HI> Who being examined and asked, why her Maiesties shippes in occasions bourd not? haue answered, and enformed; That it is the expresse order of her Maiestie and Counsell; in no case to hazard her shippes by bourding: yea I haue knowne some Captaines of our owne, (to colour their faint proceedings) haue auerred as much, which is no∣thing so. For in the houre, that her Maiestie, or Counsell com∣mitteth the charge of any her shippes to any person, it is left to his discretion to bourd, or not to bourd, as the reason of seruice requireth. And therefore let no man hereafter pretend ignorance, nor for this vanitie leaue to doe his duty, or that which is most pro∣bable to redound to the honour and seruice of his Prince and Countrey, and to the damage of his enemy. For in case, he excuse himselfe with this allegation, it cannot but redound to his con∣demnation and disreputation; And I assure all men, that in any reasonable equalitie of shipping, we cannot desire greater aduan∣tage, then we haue of the Spaniards, by bourding. The rea∣sons why, I hold it not conuenient to discourse in perticular, but experience and tract of time, with that which I haue seene a∣mongst them, hath taught me this knowledge; and those who

<P>Hereunto they made answer; that as hitherto they had beene conformable to all the vndertakings, which I had commanded or counselled, so they would continue in the selfe same dutie and obedience to the last breath: vowing either to remaine Conque∣rours and Free-men, or else to sell their liues at that price, which their enemies should not willingly consent to buy them at. And with this resolution, both Captaine and company tooke their leaue of me, euery one particularly, and the greater part with teares, and and imbracings, though we were forthwith to depart the world, and neuer see one the other againe, but in heauen; promising to cast all forepassed imaginations into oblivion, and never more to speake of surrendry.</P>
<P>In accomplishment of this promise and determination,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They resolue to fight it out.</NOTE> they per∣severed in sustaining the fight, all this night, with the day and night following, and the third day after. In which time the E∣nemie never left vs, day nor night, beating continually vpon vs, with his great and small shott. Saving that every morning an how∣er before breake of day, hee edged a little from vs, to breath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Enemie breatheth,</NOTE> and to remedie such defects as were amisse; as also to consult, what they should doe the day and night following.</P>
<P>This time of interdiction, we imployed, in repayring our sayles, and tacklings, in stopping our leakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The English repaire their defects.</NOTE> in fishing and wolling our mastes and yards, in mending our pumpes, and in fitting and pro∣viding our selues for the day to come: though this was but little space for so many workes, yet gaue it great reliefe and comfort vnto vs, and made vs better able to endure the defence: for o∣therwise, our shippe must of force haue suncke before our surren∣dry, having many shot vnder water, and our pumpes shot to pee∣ces every day: In all this space, not any man of either part tooke rest or sleepe, and little sustenance; besides bread and wine.</P>
<P>In the second dayes fight, the Vice-admirall comming vpon our quarter, <HI>William Blanch,</HI> one of our Masters mates, with a luckie hand, made a shot vnto her, with one of our sterne peeces; it cari∣ed away his maine Mast close by the decke: wherewith the Ad∣mirall beare vp to her, to see what harme shee had received, and to giue her such succour, as shee was able to spare: which we seeing, were in good hope, that they would haue now left to molest vs a∣ny
<PB N="148" REF="78"/>
longer, having wherewithall to entertaine themselues in redres∣sing their owne harmes. And so we stood away from them, close by as we could:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges omitted.</NOTE> which wee should not haue done, but prosecuted the occasion, and brought our selues close vpon her weather gage, and with our great and small shot hindered them from repairing their harmes: if we had thus done, they had beene forced to cut all by the bourd; and it may bee (lying a hull, or to le-wards of vs) with a few shot, wee might haue suncke her. At the least, it would haue declared to our enemies, that wee had them in little estimati∣on, when able to goe from them, we would not: and perhaps bin a cause to haue made them to leaue vs.</P>
<P>But this occasion was let slip, as also, that other to fight with them, sayling quarter winds, or before the winde: for having stood off to Sea, a day and a night, we had scope to fight at our pleasure, and no man having sea roome, is bound to fight as his enemie will, with disadvantage, being able otherwise to deale with equalitie: contrariwise, every man ought to seeke the meanes hee can, for his defence, and greatest advantage, to the annoyance of his contra∣rie.</P>
<P>Now wee might with our fore-saile, low set, haue borne vpp be∣fore the winde, and the enemie of force must haue done the like▪ if hee would fight with vs, or keepe vs company: and then should wee haue had the advantage of them. For although their Artillery were longer, waightier, and many more then ours, and in truth did pierce with greater violence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difference of shot.</NOTE> yet ours being of greater bore, and carrying a waightier and greater shot, was of more importance and of better effect for sinking and spoyling: For the smaller shot passeth through, and maketh but his whole, and harmeth that which lyeth in his way; but the greater shaketh and shivereth all it meeteth, and with the splinters, or that which it encountreth, many times doth more hurt, then with his proper circumference: as is plainely seene in the battery by land, when the Saker, the De∣my-Colverin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their effects.</NOTE> the Colverin, and demi-Canon, (being peeces that reach much further point blanke then the Cannon) are nothing of like importance for making the breach, as is the Cannon; for that this shot being ponderous pierceth with difficultie, yea wor∣keth better effects, tormenting, shaking and overthrowing all; whereas the others, with their violence, pierce better, and make onely their hole, and so hide themselues in the Wooll or Ram∣pire.</P>
<P>Besides (our Ship being yare and good of fleeridge) no doubt but we should haue played better with our Ordinance, and with
<PB N="149" REF="78"/>
more effect, then did our enemies; which was a great errour, be∣ing able to fight with lesse disadvantage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errors in Fight,</NOTE> and yet to fight with the most that could be imagined, which I knew not off, neither was a∣ble to direct, though I had knowne it; being in a manner senselesse, what with my woonds, and what with the agony of the surrendry propounded, for that I had seldome knowne it spoken of, but that it came afterwards to be put in execution.</P>
<P>The Generall not being able to succour his Vice-admirall, ex∣cept he should vtterly leaue vs, gaue them order, to shift as well as they could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the present, and to beare with the next Port, and there to repayre their harmes. Himselfe presently followed the Chase, and in short space fetched vs vp, and beganne a fresh to bat∣ter vs with his great and small shott. The Vice-admirall (hauing saued what they could) cutt the rest by the bourd, and with Fore∣sayle and My son came after vs also, and before the setting of the Sunne, were come vpon our broad side, wee bearing all our Sayles, and after kept vs company, lying vpon our weather quarter, and annoying vs what shee could.</P>
<P>Here I hold it necessary, to make mention of two things, which were most preiudiciall vnto vs, and the principall causes of our per∣dition, the errours and faults of late dayes, crept in amongst those who follow the Sea, and learned from the <HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Easterlings.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Learned from the <HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Easter∣lings.</HI></NOTE> I wish that by our misfortunes others would take warning, and procure to redresse them, as occasions shall be offered.</P>

<P>In fights, all receipts which adde courage and spirit, are of great regard, to be allowed, and vsed; and so is a draught of Wine, to be giuen to euery man before he come to action, but more then e∣nough is pernicious; for, exceeding the meane, it offendeth, and infeebleth the sences, converting the strength (which should resist the force of the enemy) into weakenesse: it dulleth and blindeth the vnderstanding, and consequently depraueth any man of true valour. For that he is disenabled to iudge and apprehend the occa∣sion,

which may be offered, to assault, and retyre in time conve∣nient; the raynes of reason being put into the hands of passion and disorder. For after I was wounded, this <HI>nimium</HI> bred great disor∣der and inconvenience in our Shippe; the pott continually wal∣king, infused desperate and foolish hardinesse in many, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o blin∣ded with the fume of the liquor, considered not of any danger, but thus and thus would stand at hazard; some in vaine glory, vaunting themselues; some other rayling vpon the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; another inviting his companion to come and stand by him; and not to budge a foote from him; which indiscreetly they put in exe∣cution, and cost the liues of many a good man, slaine by our ene∣mies Muskettiers, who suffered not a man to shew himselfe, but they presently overthrew him with speed and watchfullnesse; For prevention of the second errour, although I had great pre∣paration of Armours, as well of proofe, as of light Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eletts, yet not a man would vse them; but esteemed a pott of Wine, a better defence then an Armour of proofe. Which truely was great mad∣nesse, and a lamentable fault, worthy to be banished from amongst all reasonable people, and well to be weighed by all Commanders. For if the <HI>Spaniard</HI> surpasseth vs in any thing, it is in his tempe∣rance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaniard</HI> surpasseth vs onely in tem∣perance.</NOTE> and suffering: and, where he hath had the better hand of vs, it hath beene (for the most part) through our owne folly, for that we will fight vnarmed with him being armed. And although I haue heard many men maintaine, that in Shipping, Armour is of little profit; All men of good vnderstanding, will condemne such desperate ignorance. For besides, that the sleightest Armour secu∣reth the parts of a mans body (which it covereth) from Pike, Sword, and all hand weapons: it likewise giueth boldnesse and courage; a man Armed, giueth a greater and a waightier blow, then a man vnarmed; he standeth faster, and with greater difficul∣tie is to be overthrowne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The vse and profit of ar∣ming,</NOTE>And I neuer read, but that the glistering of the Armour hath beene by Authors obserued, for that (as I imagine) his show breedeth terror in his contraries, and despayre to himselfe if he be vnarmed. And therefore in time of warre, such as devote themselues to follow the profession of Armes (by Sea or by Land) ought to covet no∣thing more, then to be well Armed; for as much as it is the second meanes, next Gods protection, for preseruing, and prolonging many mens liues.</P>

He which cannot

come to the price of a Corslet, will haue a coate of Mayle, a Iackett, at least, a Buffe-jerkin, or a privie Coate. And hardly will they be found without it, albeit, they liue; and serue (for the most part) in extreame hott Countries.</P>
<P>Whereas I haue knowne many bred in cold Countries, in a mo∣ment complaine of the waight of their Armes, that they smoother them, and then cast them off, chusing rather to be shott through with a Bullet, or lanched through with a Pike, or thrust through with a Sword, then to endure a little travaile and suffering. But let me giue these lazie ones this lesson, that he that will goe a warre∣fare, must resolue himselfe to fight; and he that putteth on this re∣solution, must be contented to endure both heate and waight, first, for the safegard of his life, and next for subduing of his ene∣mie; both which are hazarded, and put into great danger, if he fight vnarmed with an enemy armed.</P>
<P>Now for mine owne opinion, I am resolved that Armour is more necessary by Sea, then by Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armes more necessary by Sea, then at Land.</NOTE> yea, rather to be excused on the shore, then in the Shippe. My reason is, for that on the shore the Bullet onely hurteth, but in the Shippe, I haue seene the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plinters kill and hurt many at once, and yet the shor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to haue passed with∣out touching any person. As in the <HI>Galeon,</HI> in which I came out of the <HI>Indies,</HI> in Anno 1597. in the rode of <HI>Tercera,</HI> when the Queenes Maiesties Shippes, vnder the charge of the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI>▪ chased vs into the rode, with the splinters of one shott, were slaine, maymed, and sore hurt, at the least a dozen persons, the most part whereof had beene excused, if they had beene Armed.</P>
<P>And doubtlesse, if these errours had beene foreseene, and reme∣died by vs, many of those who were slaine and hurt, had beene on foote, and we inabled to haue sustained and maintained the fight much better and longer; and perhaps at last had freed our selues. For if our enemy had come to bourd with vs, our close fights were such, as we were secure, and they open vnto vs. And what with our Cubridge heads, one answering the other, our hatches vpon bolts, our brackes in our Deckes, and Gunner roome, it was impossible to take vs as long as any competent number of men had remained, twentie persons would haue sufficed for defence; and for this, such Shippes are called <HI>Impregnable,</HI> and are not to be taken, but by sur∣render, not to be overcome, but with bourding or sinking, as in vs by experience was verified: and not in vs alone, but in the <HI>Revenge</HI> of the Queenes Maiestie, which being compassed round about with all the <HI>Armado</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and bourded sundry times by many at once, is said, to haue sunke three of the <HI>Armado</HI> by her side.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="80"/>And in this conflict, having lost all her Mastes, and being no other then a logge in the Sea, could not bee taken with all their force and pollicie, till shee surrendred her selfe by an honourable composition.</P>
<P>By these presidents, let Governours by Sea take speciall care aboue all, to preserue their people, in imitation of the French; who carrie many Souldiers in their shippes of Warre, and secure them in their holdes, till they come to entring, and to proue their forces by the dint of Sword.</P>
<P>But here the discreete Commaunders are to put difference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A difference for Comman∣ders.</NOTE> be∣twixt those which defend, and those which are to offend, and be∣twixt those which assault, and those which are assaulted. For (as I haue sayd) no governement whatsoever, better requireth a per∣fect and experimented Commaunder, then that of the Sea. And so no greater errour can bee committed, then to commend such charges to men vnexperimented in this profession.</P>
<P>A third and last cause, of the losse of sundry of our men, most worthy of note for all Captaines, owners, and Carpenters: was the race building of our shippe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Race-ships of Warre disliked</NOTE> the onely fault shee had; and now a dayes, held for a principall grace in any shippe: but by the ex∣perience which I haue had, it seemeth for sundry reasons verie preiudiciall for shippes of Warre, For in such, those which tackle the sayles, of force must bee vpon the deckes, and are open with∣out shelter, or any defence: yet here it will be obiected; That for this inconvenience, wast clothes are provided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wast-clothes not so vsefull,</NOTE> and for want of them, it is vsuall to lace a bonnet, or some such shadow for the men; worthily may it bee called a shadow, and one of the most pernitious customes, that can be vsed, for this shadow, or defence, being but of linnen or wollen cloth, emboldeneth many; who without it would retire to better securitie, whereas now thinking themselues vnseene, they become more bould, then otherwise they would, and thereby shot through, when they least thinke of it; Some Captaines observing this errour, haue sought to reme∣die it, in some of his Maiesties shippes: not by altering the buil∣ding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">as other devi∣ses.</NOTE> but by devising a certaine defence, made of foure or fiue inch planckes of fiue foote high, and sixe foote broad, running vpon wheeles, and placed in such partes of the shippe, as are most open. These they name blenders, and made of Elme for the most part; for that it shivers not with a shot, as Oake and other Tim∣ber will doe, which are now in vse and service, but best it is, when the whole side hath one blender, and one armour of proofe, for defence of those, which of force must labour, and be a lost.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="80"/>This race building, first came in, by overmuch homing in of our shippes; and received for good, vnder colour of making our ships thereby the better sea-shippes, and of better advantage to hull and trye: but in my iudgement, it breedeth many inconveniences, and is farre from working the effect they pretend, by disinabling them for bearing their cage worke correspondent, to the proportion and mould of the shippe, making them tender sided, and vnable to car∣ry sayle in any fresh gaile of winde, and diminishing the play of their Artillery, and the place for accommodating their people to fight, labor, or rest.</P>
<P>And I am none of those, who hold opinion, that the over-much homing in, the more the better, is commodious and easier for the shippe; and this out of the experience, that I haue learned; which with forcible reasons, I could proue to be much rather discomodi∣ous and worthy to be reformed. But withall I hold it not neces∣sary to discourse here of that particulari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie, but leaue the conse∣quence to men of vnderstanding, and so surcease.</P>

And so are Arrowes of fire, to bee shot out of slur-bowes, and cases of small shot ioyned two and two together, with peeces of wyer of fiue or six ynches long, which also shot out of muskets are of good effect, for tearing the sayles, or cutting the tackling.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion, that crosse barres and chaine-shot, are of moment for the spoyling of Masts and Yards, but experience dayly teacheth, them not to be of great importance, though neere
<PB N="154" REF="81"/>
at hand, I confesse, they worke great execution: but the round shott, is the onely principall and powerfull meane, to breake Mast or Yard.</P>
<P>And in this our fight, the Admirall of the Spaniards, had his fore-mast shot through with two round shott,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaniards</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore-mast thrice shot through.</NOTE> some three yardes beneath the head; had either of them entred but foure ynches further into the heart of the Mast, without all doubt, it had freed vs, and perhaps put them into our hands. The third day in the after-noone which was the 22. of Iune 1594. according to our computation, and which I follow in this my discourse, our sayles being torne, our Mastes all perished, our pumpes rent, and shot to peeces, and our shippe with foureteene short vnder water, and se∣ven or eight foote of water in hold; many of our men being slaine, and the most part of them (which remayned) sore hurt, and in a manner altogether fruiteles, and the enemie offering still to receaue vs a <HI>buena querra,</HI> and to giue vs life and libertie, and imbarkation for our countrey; Our Captaine, and those which remayned of our Company, were all of opinion that our best course was to surrender our selues, before our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hippe suncke. And so by com∣mon consent agreed the second time, to send a servant of mine <HI>Tho∣mas Sanders,</HI> to signifie vnto mee the estate of our shippe and com∣pany; And that it was impossible by any other way to expect for hope of deliverance, or life, but by the miraculous hand of God, in vsing his Almighty power; or by an honourable surrender: which in every mans opinion was thought most convenient. So was I desired by him, to giue also my consent, that the Captaine might capitulate with the Spanish Generall, and to compound the best <HI>partido</HI> he could by surrendring our selues into his hands: vpon condition of life and libertie. This hee declared vnto me, being in a manner voyd of sence, and out of hope to liue or reco∣ver, which considered, and the circumstances of his relation, I an∣swered as I could, that hee might iudge of my state, readie every moment to giue vp the Ghost, and vnable to discerne in this cause what was convenient, except I might see the present state of the shippe. And that the honour or dishonour, the wel-fare or misery, was for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, which should be partakers of life; At last, for that I had satisfaction of his valour and true dealing, in all the time, hee had served me, and in correspondence of it, had given him (as was notorious) charge and credit in many occasions, I bound him, by the loue and regard, hee ought me, and by the faith and duty to Almighty God, to tell me truely, if all were as he had de∣clared. Whereunto hee made answere, that hee had manifested
<PB N="155" REF="81"/>
vnto mee the plaine and naked truth, and that hee tooke God to witnesse of the same truth; with which receiving satisfaction, I for∣ced my selfe what I could, to perswade him to annimate his com∣panions, and in my name to intreate the Captaine, and the rest to persevere in defence of their libertie, liues, and reputation, remit∣ting all to his discretion: not doubting, but he would be tender of his dutie, and zealous of my reputation, in preferring his liber∣ty, and the liberty of the Company aboue all respects whatsoever. As for the welfare hoped by a surrender, I was altogether vnlikely to be partaker thereof, Death threatning to depriue me of the be∣nefit, which the Enemie offered; but if God would bee pleased to free vs, the ioy and comfort I should receiue, might perhaps giue me force and strength to recover health.</P>
<P>Which answere being delivered to the Captaine, hee present∣ly caused a slagge of truce, to be put in place of our Ensigne, and began to parley of our surrendry, with a Spaniard, which <HI>Don Bel∣tran</HI> appointed for that purpose, from the poope of the Admirall, to offer in his name, the conditions before specified; with his faith∣full promise and oath, as the King Generall to take vs a <HI>buena quer∣ra,</HI> and to send vs all into our owne Countrey. The promise hee accepted, and sayd, that vnder the same, hee yeelded, and surren∣dred himselfe, shippe, and company. Immediately, there came vn∣to me another servant of mine, and told me, that our Captaine had surrendred himselfe, and our shippe; which vnderstood, I called vnto one <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an Gomes de Pineda,</HI> a Spanish Pilote, which was our prisoner, and in all the fight we had kept close in hold, and willed him to goe to the Generall <HI>Don Beltran de Castro</HI> from mee, to tell him, that if he would giue vs his word, and oath, as the Generall of the King, and some pledge for confirmation, to receiue vs a <HI>buena querra,</HI> and to giue vs our liues and libertie, and present pas∣sage into our owne Countrey, that we would surrender our selues, and shippe into his handes; Otherwise, that hee should never en∣ioy of vs, nor ours, any thing, but a resolution every man to dye fighting.</P>
<P>With this Message I dispatched him, and called vnto me all my Company, and encouraged them to sacrifice their liues fighting, and killing the Enemie, if he gaue but a fillip to any of our com∣panions.

In confirmation whereof, he tooke of his gloue, and sent it to mee, as a pledge.</P>
<P>With this message <HI>Iohn G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes</HI> returned, and the Spaniards en∣tred, and tooke possession of our shippe, every one crying <HI>buena querra, buena querra, oy p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in maniana porti:</HI> with which our Com∣pany began to secure themselues.</P>

Once loosed, they put them into a bagge vnder their armes, and after bring them vp into their boates; having loaden it, they goe to the shoare: there they open them, and take out the Pearles: they lie vnder the vt∣termost part of the circuite of the Oyster, in rankes and proporti∣ons, vnder a certaine part, which is of many pleights and folds, cal∣led the Ruffe, for the similitude, it hath vnto a Ruffe.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this Navigation, after our surrender, the Generall tooke especial care for the good intreaty of vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Generall continueth his honourable v∣sage, towards the sicke and wounded.</NOTE> and especially of those who were hurt. And God so blessed the hands of our Surgians (besides that they were expert in their Art) that of all our wounded men not one died, that was aliue the day after our surrendry: The number whereof was neere fortie; and many of them with eight, ten, or twelue wounds, and some with more. The thing that ought to moue vs to giue God Almighty especiall thankes and prayses; was, that they were cured in a man∣ner without instruments or salues: For the chests were all broken to peeces; and many of their simples and compounds throwne into the Sea; those which remained, were such, as were throwne about the shippe in broken pots and baggs, and such as by the Di∣vine providence were reserved, at the end of three dayes, by order from the Generall, were commaunded to be sought and gathered together. These with some instruments of small moment, bought and procured from those, who had reserved them to a different end, did not onely serue for our cures, but also for the curing of the Spa∣niards, being many more, then those of our Company.</P>
<P>For the Spanish Surgians were altogether ignorant in their profession, and had little or nothing wherewith to cure. And I haue noted, that the Spaniards in generall are nothing so curious, in ac∣commodating themselues, with good and carefull Surgeans, nor to fitt them with that which belongeth to their profession, as other Nations are, though they haue greater neede then any, that I doe know.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="84"/>At the time of our surrender, I had not the Spanish tongue, and so was forced to vse an interpreter, or the Latine, or French; which holpe m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much for the vnderstanding of those, which spake vnto me in Spanish; together with a little smattering I had of the Por∣tugall.</P>
<P>Through the noble proceeding of <HI>Don Beltran</HI> with vs, and his particuler care towards me, in curing and comforting me, I began to gather heart, and hope of life, and health; my servants which were on foote, advised me ordinarily of that which past. But some of our enemies, badly inclined, repined at the proceedings of the Generall; and sayd, he did ill to vse vs so well; that wee were <HI>Lu∣therans</HI>; and for that cause, the saith which was given vs, was not to be kept nor performed: Others, that we had fought as good Soul∣diers, and therefore d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>served good quarter. Others, nicknamed vs with the name of <HI>Corsarios,</HI> or Pirats; not discerning thereby that they included themselues within the same imputation. Some were of opinion, that from <HI>Panama,</HI> the Generall would send vs into Spaine; Others sayd, that he durst not dispose of vs, but by order from the Vice-roy of <HI>Peru,</HI> who had given him his authority. This hit the nayle on the head.</P>
<P>To all I gaue the hearing, and laid vp in the store-house of my memory, that which I thought to be of substance, and in the store-house of my consideration, endevoured to frame a proportiona∣ble resolution to all occurrants, conformable to Gods most holy will. Withall I profitted my selfe of the meanes, which should bee offered, and beare greatest probabilitie to worke our comfort, help, and remedie. And so, as time ministred oportunitie, I began, and endevoured to satisfie the Generall, and the better sort in the points I durst intermeddle. And especially to perswade (by the best rea∣sons I could) that wee might be sent presently from <HI>Panama:</HI> Al∣leaging the promise given vs, the cost and charges ensuing, which doubtles would be such as deserued consideration and excuse: be∣sides that, now whilest he was in place, and power and authority in his hands, to performe with vs, that hee would looke into his ho∣nour, and profit himselfe of the occasion, and not put vs into the hands of a third person; who perhaps bring more powerfull then himselfe, he might be forced to pray and intreate the performance of his promise; whereunto hee gaue vs the hearing, and bare vs in hand, that hee would doe, what hee could.</P>
<P>The Generall, and all in generall, not onely in the <HI>Peru,</HI> but in all <HI>Spaine,</HI> and the Kingdomes thereof (before our surrendry) held all English men of Warre, to be <HI>Corsarlos,</HI> or Pirats; which I la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oured
<PB N="161" REF="84"/>
to reforme, both in the <HI>Peru,</HI> and also in the Counsels of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and amongst the Chieftaines, souldiers, and better sort, with whom I came to haue conversation; Alleadging that a Pirate or <HI>Corsario,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What a Pirate is.</NOTE> is he, which in time of peace, or truce spoyleth, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth those, which haue peace or truce with them: but the Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish haue ney∣ther peace nor truce with Spaine, but warre; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore not to be accounted Pirats. Besides, Spaine broke the peace with England, and not England with Spaine; and that by <HI>Ymbargo,</HI> which of all kinds of defiances, is most reproved, and of least reputation; The ransoming of prysoners, and that by the Cannon, being more ho∣norable, but aboue all, the most honorable, is with Trumpet and Herald, to proclaime and denounce the warre by publicke defi∣ance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Sorts of defiances.</NOTE> And so if they should condemne the English for Pirats, of force, they must first condemne themselues.</P>
<P>Moreover, Pirats are those, who range the Seas without licence of their Prince; who when they are met with, are punished more se∣verely by their owne Lords, then when they fall into the hands of strangers; which is notorious to be more severely prosecuted in England (in time of peace) then in any the Kingdomes of Chri∣stendome.</P>
<P>But the English haue all licence, either immediately from their Prince, or from others therevnto authorized, and so cannot in a∣ny sence be comprehended vnder the name of Pirats▪ for any ho∣stility vndertaken against Spaine, or the dependancies thereof.</P>
<P>And so the state standing as now it doth; if in Spaine a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣ler man should arme a shippe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Custome of Spaine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or of warre.</NOTE> and goe in warre-fare with it against the English, and happened to be taken by them: I make no questi∣on, but the Company should bee intreated according to that man∣ner, which they haue ever vsed since the beginning of the Warre: without making further Inquisition.</P>
<P>Then if hee were rich or poore, to see if hee were able to giue a ransome, in this also they are not very curious. But if this spanish shippe should fall a thwart his Kings Armado, or Gallies, I make no doubt but they would hang the Captaine and his Companie for Pirates. My reason is, for that by a speciall law, it is enacted: that no man, in the kingdomes of Spaine, may arme any shippe, and goe in warre-fare, without the Kings speciall licence and com∣mission; vpon paine to be reputed a Pirate, and to bee chastised with the punishment due to <HI>Corsarios.</HI> In England the case is dif∣ferent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Custome of England.</NOTE> for the warre once proclaimed, every man may arme that will, and hath wherewith; which maketh for our greater exempti∣on, from being comprehended within the number of Pirates.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="85"/>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h these, and other like Arguments to this purpose, (to avoid tediousnes) I omitt; I convinced all those whom I heard to harpe vpon this string; which was of no small importance for our good entreatie, and motiues for many, to further and favour the ac∣complishment of the promise lately made vnto vs.</P>

And this is that which I haue knowne practised in our times, in gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all amongst all civill and noble Na∣tions.

<P>With this, <HI>Don Beltran</HI> sayd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Don Beltran</HI> satisfied</P><P>And answereth.</P></NOTE> This ambiguitie you haue well re∣solved; And like a worthie Gentleman (with great courtesie and liberalitie) added; <HI>Let not the last point trouble you: but bee of good comfort, for I heere giue you my word anew, that your ransome (if any shall bee thought due) shall be but a cople of Grey-ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for mee; and o∣ther two for my Brother, the</HI> Conde de Lemes, <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this I sweare to you by the habit of Alcantera.</HI> Provided alwayes, that the King my Ma∣ster leave you to my dispose, as of right you belong vnto me.</P>
<P>For amongst the Spaniards in their Armadoes, if there bee an absolute Generall, the tenth of all is due to him, and he is to take choise of the best: where in other Countries, it is by lot, that the Generalls tenth is given; And if they be but two shippes, he doth the like, and being but one, shee is of right the Generalls. This I hardly believed, vntill I saw a Letter, in which the King willed his Vice-roy, to giue <HI>Don Beltran</HI> thankes for our shippe and Artillerie, which he had given to his Maiestie.</P>
<P>I yeelded to the Generall, most heartie thankes for his great favour, wherewith hee bound mee ever to seeke how to serue him, and deserue it.</P>

And amongst other things two peeces of speciall estimation, the one a Table of massie gold, with Emralds, sent for a present to the King; the other a Lady of singu∣lar beautie, married, and a mother of Children.

<P>In this wavering, one of the Souldiers espied certaine feathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And evill For∣tune.</NOTE> of Henns, and some boughes of trees, (which they had cut off to make their way) swmming downe one of the Outlets.

<P>What succeeded to mee, and to the rest during our Imprisoment, with the rarities and particularities of the <HI>Peru,</HI> and <HI>Tierra firme,</HI> my voyage to <HI>Spaine,</HI> and the successe, with the time I spent in pryson in the <HI>Peru,</HI> in the <HI>Tercera,</HI> in <HI>Sevill,</HI> and in <HI>Madrid,</HI> with the acci∣dents which befell me in them; I leaue for a second part of this discourse, if God giue life, and convenient place and rest, necessa∣ry for so tedious and troublesome a worke: desiring God, that is Almightie, to giue his blessing to this and the rest of my in∣tentions: that it and they may bee fruitefull, to his glory, and the good of all: then shall my de∣sires be accomplished, and I account my selfe most happie. To whom be all glory, and thankes from all eternitie</P>
