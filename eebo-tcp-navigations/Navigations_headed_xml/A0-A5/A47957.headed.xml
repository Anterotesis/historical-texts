<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis Book was at first a Manuscript composed in <HI>Italian</HI> for the use of the present <HI>Great Duke of Flor∣ence</HI> by <HI>Signior Gregorio Leti</HI> the ingenious Au∣thor of the <HI>Cardinalismo</HI> and <HI>Nepotismo,</HI> from whom the Translator had
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>it at <HI>Geneva.</HI> Some ne∣cessary occasions having called the <HI>Author</HI> lately into this Country, the <HI>Translator</HI> communicat∣ed to him his design of turning that Treatise in∣to English, which he not only approved of, as knowing the value of the <HI>thing,</HI> but hath since ad∣ded with his own hand some remarkable passages which conduce not a little to the accomplishment of the work, and are of so
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>fresh a date, as cannot as yet have been published by any other. So that, Reader, you have here within the narrow com∣pass of so little a Treatise all that indeed can be said, or is necessary to be known concerning that so famed City and Republick.</P>

<HEAD>THE PESENT STATE OF <HI>GENEVA,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GENEVA,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquity.</NOTE> as appears by some Chronicles of the Country of <HI>Vaux,</HI> is one of the ancientest Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> being commonly sup∣posed to have been built by <HI>Lemanus,</HI> Son of <HI>Hercules,</HI> the great King of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> who gave the name like∣wise to the Lake <HI>Lemane,</HI> by many cal∣led the Lake of <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P>The first foundation of it was laid in the year of the World 3994. upon a little rising Hill covered with Juniper Trees, called by the French <HI>Geneuriers,</HI> from whence it afterwards took the name of <HI>Geneura; Lemanus</HI> having gran∣ted many Priviledges to the place, and erected the same into a City incorpo∣rated with great immunities and free∣domes,
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>prescrib'd them a Form of Go∣vernment suitable to the Customes of those times.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> this Ci∣ty was of great renown, and by him called the Bulwork of <HI>Helvetia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Julius Cae∣sar.</NOTE> and frontiere Town of the <HI>Allobrogi,</HI> which name at present it deserves more than ever.</P>
<P>When the eruption was made upon the <HI>Swissers</HI> in the year of God 230. by the Emperor <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heliogabi∣lus.</NOTE> <HI>Geneva</HI> was al∣most utterly destroyed by Fire; but in the time of <HI>Aurelian</HI> the Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Destroyed.</NOTE> about the year of Grace 270. it was by the command of the same Emperor rebuilt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebuilt.</NOTE> who having bestowed many priviledges on those that came to repair it, com∣manded it for the future to be called <HI>Aurelia,</HI> but the Inhabitants could not easily banish from their minds the an∣cient name of <HI>Geneva,</HI> which to this day it holds, tho during the Life of <HI>Aure∣lian,</HI> they called it <HI>Aurelia.</HI></P>
<P>The Situation of this City is one of the pleasantest in <HI>Europe,</HI> being on the North side, washed by the Lake, and on the South adorned with a spatious
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>Neighbouring Plain, reaching to the very Walls, and encompassed by two large Rivers, the <HI>Rone</HI> and the <HI>Arue.</HI></P>
<P>This plain serves the Citizens for a place of diversion and Recreation: There they walk to take the Air, and refresh themselves in the delightful Gardens, which inviron it, of which there is a great number. There like∣wise they train and exercise their Soul∣diers, and divert themselves at Play in a long Mall.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plain Pa∣lace.</NOTE>This Plain is commonly called the <HI>Plain Palace,</HI> and in a Corner thereof, where the <HI>Arue</HI> falls into the <HI>Rone,</HI> there is a spatious burying place for the dead.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burying-Place.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Confines of <HI>Geneva</HI> are on the East, and South the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> on the West the Country of <HI>Gex</HI> belong∣ing to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and on the North side the Lake. <HI>Lemane,</HI> and be∣yond that <HI>Switzerland:</HI> From the Stee∣ple of St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church, which is a strong high Tower might have been seen formerly six (tho at present but five Principalities, the Spanish <HI>Burgun∣dy</HI> being united to <HI>France</HI>) to wit, <HI>Sa∣voy, France,</HI> the Spanish <HI>Burgundy, Swit∣zerland,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>Sion,</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> a thing so singular, as cannot be parallel'd in the World.</P>
<P>This City hath of a long time been walled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortifica∣tions.</NOTE> and indifferently well fortified; but since the year 1659. the Fortifica∣tions both within and without have been augmented with Bastions, half-Moons, and Bulwarks, at which they are still busily imployed, the Engineer of the Republick, an expert and skil∣ful Artist, daily assisting and over-seeing their work.</P>
<P>In the year 1662. The States and o∣ther private Persons of the United <HI>Ne∣therlands</HI> made a Present to the Repub∣lick of above thirty thousand Crowns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hollanders</NOTE> which Sum was applyed to the raising of a strong and regular Bulwork on the side of the <HI>Rone,</HI> whereon by Order of the Senate this Inscription was put,</P>
<Q><HI>Oppugna oppugnantes me ex munificentiâ Celsiss. Ordinum Faederatorum</HI> Belgii, 1663.</Q>
<P>The City seems divided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bridges.</NOTE> because the <HI>Rone</HI> running through it maketh two Islands, that sustain four Bridges, two whereof which joyn to St. <HI>Gervase</HI> have
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>houses and shops upon them, but the other two that are united with the bo∣dy of the City, since the fire in the year 1670. have been left open with∣out any houses to cover them.</P>
<P>Before the Reformation there were many casual fires, sometimes in one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fires.</NOTE> and sometimes in another part of the City; but since the year 1534 that the Reformation began, until 1670. by the grace of God and provident care of the Magistrates, the City remained free from any such accident, when on <HI>Mon∣day</HI> the 17th. of <HI>January</HI> about twelve of the Clock at night a dreadful fire broke out upon one of the largest and most inhabited of the four Bridges, and burnt with so much force and rage, that in the space of three hours, tho the night was calm, without a breath of Wind stirring, the whole buildings, to the number of threescore and ten houses, were utterly consumed in the Conflagration, above an hundred and thirty Families deprived of habitation and a hundred Persons, Men, Women, and Children destroyed in the merciless flames; a dreadfull argument, that if the People could not escape with
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>their Lives, they cou'd not save their Goods. The loss was reputed to a∣mount to a French Million of Mony, and was the greater, because many sub∣stantial Merchants lived upon that Bridge. Many Collections were pre∣sently made throughout the City, for the relief of those poor People that were burnt out of all, and the Prote∣stants of <HI>Switzerland, Germany,</HI> and o∣ther places gave seasonable instances of their Charity to the distressed upon that occasion.</P>
<P>The Bridge is now rebuilt with most excellent Workmanship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New-B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idge.</NOTE> but by Decree of the Senate no houses nor Shops are for the future to be built upon it, tho it be much stronger now than it was before, so that the City seems at present di∣vided.</P>
<P>The Fabrick of their houses is not very considerable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Buil∣ding.</NOTE> the People having been alwayes more addicted to conveni∣ence than magnificence, so that we need say nothing but of their publick Structu∣res, which are, the Town House, repaired and beautified since the Reformation, the Arsenal, five publick Granaries, the Mint and the Towers, two of which
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>stand, one on each side of the New-Bridge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesia∣stick Buil∣dings.</NOTE>The Ecclesiastick Fabricks are the four Churches, to wit, St. <HI>Peters</HI> the Cathedral, St. <HI>Gervase,</HI> St. <HI>Magdalens,</HI> and St. <HI>Germans,</HI> besides two little Chap∣pels, where the Lectures of Theology, Greek Hebrew and Philosophy are held; and in the biggest of the two, preach∣ing in high Dutch.</P>
<P>There is besides a Colledge built since the Reformation, containing Schools for the Youth that learn humanity, and houses for the Ministers and Profes∣sors.</P>
<P>There were heretofore most magni∣ficent Buildings, both for the Regular and Secular Clergy, and especially the rich Abbey of St. <HI>Victor,</HI> the Abbot whereof was a Temporal Prince inve∣sted with many Jurisdictions.</P>
<P>In the great Hall of the Colledge is the Library, furnished with excellent Old Books. The Library Keeper is a Minister, who is to take care of it, and shew it to such Strangers as desire to see it.</P>
<P>Every day in the week there is prea∣ching in two places (to wit) in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preaching</NOTE>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>Churches of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>Gervase,</HI> and thrice a week in St. <HI>Magdalens,</HI> but on <HI>Sunday,</HI> there are three Sermons at St. <HI>Peters,</HI> and as many at St. <HI>Gervase's,</HI> that is, two in the forenoon, and one in the afternoon; besides Catechizing at Noon in each of the said Churches. There is preaching twice every <HI>Sunday</HI> likewise at St. <HI>Magdalens</HI> in the Morning and Evening, with Catechizing at Noon. Every <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, and <HI>Wednesday</HI> in the afternoon, there is a Sermon in High Dutch, and every <HI>Thursday</HI> in Ita∣lian.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church was in ancient times dedicated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> as is to be seen in some very old Inscriptions, se∣veral Cardinals and many Prelates of great Renown were buried in this Church when the Romish Religion flourished here; and since the Refor∣mation in one of its Chappels, <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o</HI> 1628. was interred <HI>Emilia</HI> of <HI>Nassau,</HI> and sometime after the Princess her Si∣ster, both Sisters to the Prince of <HI>O∣range, Emilia</HI> being Wife to <HI>Don Anto∣nio</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who was banished by the Spaniards. In another Chappel lies the Body of the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> bu∣ried
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>in the year 1638 in a most magni∣ficent Monument built by his Dutchess, who was laid there also near her Hus∣band, in the year 1660. as their Son <HI>Tan∣cred</HI> was in the Year 1661.</P>
<P>There are two Hospitals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hospita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> the one within the City for releif of the Poor, not only of the Place, but likewise of all sorts of Strangers; and the other without the City in the Burying-place of the <HI>Plain-Palace,</HI> being a Pest-house for receiving of the infected in time of the Plague; when the Catholick Religi∣on reigned here, there were seven Ho∣spitals.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Master of the Hospi∣tals.</NOTE>The Master of the Hospital continues in place three years, but he is usually confirmed by the Counsel of two hun∣dred, who have the power of Election for the next three years, and this place, as being very profitable, is much sought after. He hath for his Assistants (who are the Governors of the Hospital) nine Laymen with a Minister and a Syndick, who is President in all Courts kept for the management of the Revenue of the Hospital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Visiting of the dead.</NOTE>When any one dies, the body is in∣stantly veiwed by a Chirurgion appoin∣ted
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>by the Senate for that purpose; and without this search it cannot be buried.</P>
<P>The Dead are buried without any ceremonious Pomp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burying.</NOTE> being accompani∣ed to the Grave by few or many, accor∣ding to the quality of the person, but there is no obligation upon any to be present unless invited.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burying of Strangers of Quality.</NOTE>Persons of Quality, who are stran∣gers, are interred in the Cloyster of St. <HI>Peters,</HI> where <HI>Theodore Beza,</HI> who depar∣ted this life in the Year 1604. lies bu∣ried.</P>

<P>Many of the Inhabitants, who die in that quarter of the City are usually buried in this Churchyard.</P>
<P>Marriages are here celebrated with the usual Ceremonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marria∣ges.</NOTE> that is with the consent of the Parties, who being agreed, and having mutually past a Promise of Marriage and interchang'd a Ring (if they think it fit) they make a note of the Banes, with the names of the Per∣sons to be married, which being sign∣ed by the cheif Syndick, is given to the Minister, who publishes the same from the Pulpit three Sundayes successively, and afterwards, no lawful impediment being objected, they may marry when they please in the Parish Church of the Husband, or in any other Church if they judge it more convenient.</P>
<P>The Burgesses and Citizens are not tied to give any security; but the In∣habitants or Inmates (as they are cal∣led) if they intend to marry, are obli∣ged to pay to the Hospitals, or French Box, about three Pistols, or to give in security for a greater Sum, that is, for thirty Crowns.</P>
<P>Publick dancing and musick are not allowed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dancing.</NOTE> however for the most part
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>they connive at it, and suffer the Bride∣groom and Bride to pass away their time with some Dance, or Ball with∣in doores.</P>
<P>When any impediment of Marriage is objected; the matter is brought be∣fore the Consistory or Presbytery, who receive the necessary informations in the case: And in matters of Importance the parties must be cited, and appear before the Magistrates, and their cause legally tried.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabi∣tants Bur∣gesses and Citizens.</NOTE> <HI>Geneva</HI> is inhabited by three sorts of persons, Inhabitants or Inmates, Bur∣gesses and Citizens. The Inhabitants pay greater contributions than the o∣ther, and yet they enjoy not the same priviledges: Besides the Senate may send them going when they please, and it is likewise permitted to them upon leave asked to be gone, if they think it convenient.</P>
<P>The Burgesses are those who buy their Freedom, and enjoy all sorts of priviledges; but cannot be admitted to the highest Dignities, and at present the price of ones Freedome is determin∣ed according to the pleasure of the Council. The Sons of Burgesses born
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>within the City are Citizens, and may attain to the highest place and Dignity in the Republick.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Colony of divers Nations.</NOTE>In former times <HI>Geneva</HI> was a Colony of the <HI>Allobrogi,</HI> but since the reforma∣tion it is become a mixed Colony of all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> especially of <HI>French, Germans, Italians</HI> and <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> who being persecuted for the truth of the Gospel repair daily thither in whole Families: Hence it is that when before the reformation, there were not above five thousand Souls in the City, it is at present so populous by the great concourse of people who flock thither, that it contains no fewer than thirty five thousand Souls of di∣vers Nations, and this is the reason why the humor of that people is so mixt and various, that it is not easie to find out the temper of any person there without long experience and conversation; every one retaining still some Tincture of the Antient instinct of their Original Country.</P>
<P>A Prince of the Family of <HI>Hesse</HI> being in Incognito in <HI>Geneva</HI> in the Month of <HI>July</HI> 1602, composed the following verses.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clocks and Watches.</NOTE>Clock and Watch making is a Trade of great esteem, and of Masters and ser∣vants there are above three hundred that follow that occupation; of whom there are some that drive a good Trade by it, not only in all the Countries of <HI>Europe</HI> but also in <HI>Turky, Persia,</HI> and other re∣mote Kingdoms: It is necessary tho that such as come hither to buy, have their eyes in their heads; if they would not be cheated; because there are bad as well as good Artists among them.</P>

<P>The <HI>Genevians</HI> want neither Cour∣age nor resolution, having given proofs of the same on many occasions against the <HI>Savoyards,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Liberty in great e∣steem.</NOTE> but especially when their beloved liberty lies at stake, for which they are ready (as they have alwaies been) to Sacrafice a thousand lives.<NOTE PLACE="marg">an instance of it.</NOTE> <HI>Pecolat</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Geneva</HI> being ta∣ken in <HI>Savoy,</HI> and made Prisoner by <HI>Charles</HI> the Third a declared enemy

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antient Inscripti∣ons.</NOTE>In the time of Paganism <HI>Apollo</HI> was worshipped by the Genevians, as ap∣pears by many ancient Inscriptions, that are to be seen in the City.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chri∣stian Reli∣gion plan¦ted.</NOTE>By some Manuscripts, and especially in a very ancient Bible kept in the Li∣brary, it appears that the Church of

<P>The Successors of <HI>Paradocus</HI> became afterwards not only Cheif in Spirituals, but also Supream in Temporal Affairs, so that until the Year 1535. <HI>Geneva</HI> was Governed by a Succession of 74 Bishops, of which <HI>Peter de la Baume</HI> was the last, who being a Prelate odi∣ous for his lascivious life, and there∣fore very timorous, upon information that the Citizens intended to embrace the reformed Religion already receiv∣ed by their Neighbours, was so sur∣priz'd with fear of some unhappy ac∣cident in such a revolution, that he with his Chanons on a sudden retired into <HI>Burgundy,</HI> giving way (as he said) to this first popular commotion to spend it self, but he was greatly mi∣staken, for the people more encourag∣ed by the absence of their Bishop and Clergy gave a beginning to the refor∣mation,

<P><HI>Geneva</HI> was under the Jurisdiction of a Bishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop.</NOTE> as their Spiritual and Tem∣poral Head and Governour.

<P>The regular Clergy had five Mon∣asteries; three Frieries, to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monaster∣ies.</NOTE> of St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and St. <HI>Au∣gustine:</HI> And two Nunneries, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of St. <HI>Clare,</HI> and the other of <HI>Domini∣cans,</HI> with their Chaplains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eection of the Bishop.</NOTE>In the Primitive times the Bishop was elected by the general Council of the people, which was the custome likewise in other Bishopricks of <HI>Suitzer∣land;</HI> but he was alwaies confirmed
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>by the Pope, who afterward deprived them of that Priviledge, conferring the power of Election on the Chanons, who by plurality of voices chose two, of whom the Pope according to his pleasure confirmed the one.</P>
<P>There were moreover four Annual Syndicks (as there are at present) who governed as Temporal Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Election of the Syn∣dicks be∣fore the Reformati∣on.</NOTE> being Judges in Criminal causes, Lords of the City, Masters of the Gates, and of all that belonged to the Militia, which the Bishop never challenged or medled with. The General Council consisted of Citizens and Burgesses, and to it belonged the Election of the four Syndicks, which was on Saint <HI>Martins</HI> day. Every Syndick after∣wards chose five Councellors, and all together Elected a Treasurer: From sun setting until break of day, the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Syndicks alone had absolute Ju∣risdiction within the City, and acted what they judged convenient for the Publick by their own Supreame Au∣thority.</P>
<P>When the Bishops Lieutenant or Vidone, as they called him in that time, aphrehended a Malefactor, he remit∣ted
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>him to the Syndicks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Admini¦stration of Justice be∣fore the Reforma∣tion.</NOTE> who were obliged within the space of twenty four houres to do Justice upon him, from which Sentence there was no appeal; it is true the Bishop had the power of pardoning and shewing mercy if he pleased; the Sentence be∣ing given by the Syndicks, it was intimated to the Prisoner, who was then again turned over into the hands of the Bishops Lieutenant with orders from them to cause the Sentence to be put in Execution, and if the Bishop gave no pardon, the Lieutenant de∣livered up the same Prisoner to ano∣ther Lieutenant belonging to the Counts of <HI>Geneva,</HI> who were feudatories of the Bishop, and he it was that put the Sentence in Execution: this was all the power and Authority that the Counts of <HI>Geneva</HI> had;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Counts of <HI>Geneva.</HI></NOTE> and it is also to be observed that Executions were alwayes performed without the City in a place called <HI>Champel,</HI> where one of the Gibbets is to be seen to this day.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> as Successour to these Counts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pretenti∣ons of the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI></NOTE> pretends the Sover∣anity over <HI>Geneva,</HI> though there be no∣thing more certain than that the said
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>Counts never had any Jurisdiction of Command, nor right of Dominion in that City.</P>
<P>His Highness indeed makes great pretentions, and is very well satisfied with the reasonableness of the same, though they be backt with very weak and frivolous evidences, seeing the proofs that are alleadged to make good those pretentions, come far short of what they are intended to assert: one argument is, that though the Bishop of <HI>Geneva</HI> was chief in Spirituals and Temporals, and was honoured with the Title of Prince of the Empire; nevertheless (His Royal Highness would have it) it behoved him to do homage to the Duke regent as to his Superiour, and to Swear fealty to him the day of his Inauguration; but there is not one Authentick act to be found of this, and the only Oath the Bishop took was to the Syndicks, to whom he swore, to maintain and preserve the priviledges and liberties of the City.</P>
<P>It is further alledged that Duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> went frequently to <HI>Geneva</HI> with his Dutchess <HI>Beatrix,</HI> where
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>all Imaginable honor and respect was shewed him: — This I am apt to beleive, but the consequence is not good; for the <HI>Genevians</HI> are civil and obliging to all strangers, but especially to per∣sons of high merit and quality.</P>
<P>It is certain that <HI>Geneva</HI> was alwaies a free City, and that long before the House of <HI>Savoy</HI> was spoken of, or came in play, they were Governed by their own Laws and Statutes Imperial and municipal edicts; the Bishops, indeed of <HI>Geneva,</HI> who in the fall of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire raised themselves to Su∣premacy in temporals in that City, as well as other Bishops had done in o∣ther places, were commonly in contest with the Counts of <HI>Geneva,</HI> for the do∣minion and Governmenr of the City, a short account of which, <HI>I</HI> shall hear give you. After that one <HI>Humbert</HI> Bishop of <HI>Geneva</HI> had exchanged this for ano∣ther life, <HI>Andutius</HI> his Successor ap∣plied himself to the Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> the first, and obtained of him to be declared absolute Prince of the City of <HI>Geneva,</HI> that in Temporals he should be subject to none but the Emperour alone, and that he should be free, and
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>Exempt from all taxes and tribute, but the Bishop being returned with design to enjoy the prerogative granted him by the Emperour; the Counts raised greater trouble against him than before, not suffering him to exercise any such priviledges; though this storme was afterwards calmed by the Golden-bull of the same Emperour in favour of the Bishop, and published in the year, 1162. For some time after, matters went on quietly to the satis∣faction of the Bishop, until that one <HI>William</HI> Count of the <HI>Geneveses,</HI> who took upon himself the Title of Count of <HI>Geneva,</HI> being for Rebellion and o∣ther heinous Crimes outlawed by the Emperour, and deprived of the fief which he held of the Bishop, betook him∣self to his friends for help and Assistance.</P>
<P>This having occasioned a long warr whereby the forces of this Bishop and the City were much impaired the <HI>Gene∣vians</HI> call'd to their Assistance a Count of <HI>Maurianna</HI> who was afterwards Count of <HI>Savoy,</HI> but this put no end to the War; on the contrary it encreased day∣ly, in so much that the Count of <HI>Mau∣rianna</HI> being powerful, he seized several
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>places and Castles which belonged to those of <HI>Geneva,</HI> encroching dayly more and more upon the City, and not con∣tented with what he he had Usurped under the Title of Homage, he de∣manded to be reinbursed of the expen∣ces he had been at in the Wars. Hence many new quarrels arose, which lasted until the Counts of the <HI>Genevese</HI> were extinct, of whom the last was the Antipope <HI>Clement</HI> the seventh: To them the Dukes of <HI>Savoy,</HI> with con∣sent of the Bishop, succeeded as Heires, but <HI>Amadeus</HI> Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> disdaining to be under the Jurisdiction of a Bishop, procured of the Emporour the Vicar∣ship of the Empire within all his own Territories, thereby pretending that as Vicar of the Empire, the Bishop in all his Jurisdictions ought to be subject to him, but the Bishop protected by the Pope made vigorus resistance, and threatned to Excommunicate the Duke, as often, as he should pretend to revive any such pretentions, wherefore the Duke that he might not Embroil him self with the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> let fall his great pretentions, expecting a more favourable time to raise them again,
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>and so the Bishop remained in peace∣able possession of his Authority, and the people of their antient liberty.</P>
<P>Afterwards in the year, 1418. Pope <HI>Martin</HI> the fifth passing through <HI>Savoy</HI> was in all places entertained by the Duke regnant at great expences, and with the highest Demonstrations of honour, the Pope to gratifie him, of his own free motion, conferred on him the Temporal Jurisdiction over the City of <HI>Geneva,</HI> but neither the Bishop, or people for all that, even suffered the Duke to enjoy that Pontifical priviledge and concession.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="17"/>pardon for what was past, offering himself to be their mediator, for re∣conciling them againe to the Church, but the minds of the people being dis∣posed to the contrary, that Letter had no effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ban∣ishment of <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Farrel.</HI></NOTE>In the year, 1528. <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Far∣rel</HI> were banished <HI>Geneva,</HI> by order of the Council of the two hundered, be∣cause they had said openly that they could not Administer the Sacrament of the Lords supper, to loose and dissolute people, and indeed they actually refused upon an <HI>Easter</HI> day to give the Sacra∣ment to some Scandalous and lewd per∣sons, whereupon the Council of the two hundred being next day assembled, those two men were sentenced to be Banished, and presently departed.</P>
<P>The Syndicks who were the con∣trivers of that Banishment were utterly ruined two years after; one of them that told <HI>Calvin</HI> the gates were made wide enough to march out at, burst in a narrow window, through which he attempted to escape out of prison; another was beheaded, but the rest fled, and so saved their lives.</P>

<P>The Lieutenant with his Staff of Justice, two Auditors, and the Syn∣dick of the Guards with his Staff, and another Syndick all accompani∣ed with a considerable number of Of∣ficers go to the place where the fire is, and there give all orders necessary, e∣very one being obliged exactly to o∣bey them and to pull down what Con∣tiguous Houses they shall think most convenient for quenching the fire; the two Auditors take into their Custo∣dy all the goods they can, which they transport to prevent theft and robbery; and in a late fire a Burgess was hang∣ed for stealing some small trifle whilst the people were in confusion.</P>

The Sentence being read, the Prisoner is instantly delivered over into the hands of the Officers of the Lieutenant, to whom the execution of Justice belongs, but the Sentence must be immediatly executed, and therefore the Executioner appears, who taking the Prisoner by the hand,

<P>In the year 1518.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1518.1526.</NOTE> The <HI>Genevians</HI> made a League with the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Fribourg,</HI> which in the year, 1526.

<P>The reformed Religion being af∣terwards in the year, 1535.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1535.</NOTE> Establish∣ed in <HI>Geneva,</HI> the States of <HI>Fribourg</HI> moved by their Church men, sent Ambassadors to <HI>Geneva,</HI> declaring that if they would not returne into the bo∣some of the Catholick Church they would be obliged to break the League, to these propositions the <HI>Genevians</HI> would not condescend, but protested they would faithfully observe the al∣liance.</P>

<P>Lastly, on the eighteenth of <HI>October,</HI> 1584.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE> <HI>Zurich</HI> made a mutual League with <HI>Geneva,</HI> in memory whereof the Senate crected a Marble Monument with this inscription, which is to be seen in the Hall of the Town house, on the side as you go to the Arsenal.</P>

<P>Besides the above mentioned al∣liances, <HI>Geneva</HI> holds friendship and cor∣respondence upon account of the Pro∣restant Religion, with the <HI>English. Hollanders,</HI> and Protestant Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> all which in time of need would do them sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e good Offices,
<PB N="55" REF="31"/>but the truth is the Jealousie that reignes amongst neighbouring Princes, has a greater influence upon the preser∣vation of the Liberty of <HI>Geneva</HI> than any other consideration whatsoever.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Protest∣ants of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE>This City is looked upon as the only City of refuge, for the Protestants of <HI>France,</HI> seeing upon occasion of any persecution, they can retreat into this place, and that makes them on their part so solicitous for its safety and preservation, that on all occasions they would be ready to shew the ef∣fects of their good inclinations towards it, as they have already done during the War with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and it is certain that no sooner would any new War begin in <HI>Geneva,</HI> but that the Protestants of the best quality in <HI>France</HI> would come to its assistance, knowing very well, that if they be de∣prived of that Sanctuary, they must remaine exposed to the will of their enemies.</P>
<P>As to the forces of <HI>Geneva,</HI> with∣out doubt they are but inconsiderable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forces Arsenal.</NOTE> they have in the first place an Arsenal provided of all sorts of Armes for arm∣ing of six thousand men at least; be∣sides
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>a great many old Armes and Colors taken from their enemies in the time of the War.</P>
<P>There is no great store of Cannon in the Arsenal, because this City being a Frontier place, has the Walls both day and night well furnished with great Gunns, and certainly there is no fron∣tiere place better provided with Can∣non.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Private Arms.</NOTE>The private Houses are sufficiently, furnished with Armes, and there is no Citizen but hath Armes for two or three men, there are several that can Arme twenty five or thirty, and some are so well provided that they can conveni∣ently Arme three hundred Soldiers, so that every private House may be called an Arsenal, hence according to computation it is commonly reckoned that in <HI>Geneva</HI> there are Armes for for∣ty thousand men.</P>
<P>The City is alwaies well furnished with Provisions and Ammunition of all sorts conveniently distributed into Magazines and Store houses in the se∣veral quarters of the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provisi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>.</NOTE> so that if an accident should happen in the place, the City could sustaine no great
<PB N="57" REF="32"/>prejudice thereby, the other stores be∣ing sufficiently provided to supply the loss; they keep constantly Ammunition, as Powder, Bullets, Match and the like enough for a two years Siege, and a sufficient quantity of Corne for three years, having Mills within the Town alwaies in readiness to grind it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Military exercises.</NOTE>The <HI>Genevians</HI> are generally well trained in the exercises and discipline of Warr; and though they can brag of no famous Commanders (their wars having been more defensive than offensive) yet they have Soldiers of long experience in the wars, and take care to exercise their youth to Warlik exercises by conferring honor and reward on those especially who at some set times in the year obtaine the advantage of shooting.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings of the several kinds of Arms.</NOTE>They preforme those exercises chief∣ly in the Spring, the fittest time for recreation, and to raise in their youth a generous emulation for Honor, they make him who hath shot best in the Cannon, Musket, Bow, Cross-bow, or Pistol, King of that kind of Armes wherein he hath excelled, giving him a mark of Honor and some priviledges
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>in reward of his dexterity: But the King of the Harquebuses is in greatest esteem amongst them, and besides the Priviledges which are allowed him, he is after his Election attended home by the Chief of the City with show and triumph. The publick reaps no small benefit from those delightful exercis∣es, for the Citizens are thereby train∣ed in the discipline of War, and by the Honor and priviledges conferred upon the Kings, encouraged to noble undertakings.</P>
<P>But though brave men, and good Arms be the ordinary means of the de∣fence and preservation of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On what <HI>Geneva.</HI> builds its considence.</NOTE> yet the <HI>Geneveans</HI> trust not altogether to their own strength; they are sen∣sible enough of their weakness and inability to withstand the designes of their powerful enemies, who are very industrious in contriving their ruine.</P>
<P>Their chief trust therefore is in God, under whose protection they are to sa∣crifice their lives and fortunes in main∣taining of their dearly beloved darling Liberty, as by experience they have already made appear. They can must∣er of their own some thousands of well
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>trained Soldiers, but in case of War, or Siege, the four Protestant, <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Switzerland</HI> are obliged by mutual Articles to send them a supply of four thousand men, and it being the com∣mon maxim of States-men and skil∣ful Souldiers that the preservation of <HI>Geneva</HI> depends on the Friendship of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and the Liberty of <HI>Swit∣zerland</HI> on the safety of <HI>Geneva,</HI> the Ca∣tholick Cantons themselves for rea∣sons of State, and that they may not by losing that barrier expose their Li∣berty to the descretion of a Conquer∣our, will in case of need, contribute both men and mony for the assistance of that place.</P>
<P>In the year, 1602. Experience confirmed this; for in the space of few hours great supplies of men hastened in time of danger to <HI>Geneva:</HI> And the <HI>Scalado</HI> hapned about midnight in the bitterest time of Winter, yet next Evening about two thousand men un∣der several Commanders, came from the Neighbouring parts of <HI>Switzerland</HI> to the relief of the City, and about four thousand more were upon the march thither, but the danger being over,
<PB N="60" REF="34"/>they were with thanks dismissed. The History of this enterprize deserves some mention.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> night the twelfth of <HI>December,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An ac∣count of the <HI>Scala∣do.</HI></NOTE> 1602. About midnight, the Forces of <HI>Charles Emannel</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> attacqued <HI>Geneva</HI> by <HI>Scalado</HI> in this manner.</P>
<P>The Signior <HI>D' Albigni</HI> the Dakes Licutenant (the Duke in person being come post to <HI>Champey</HI> a Village near to <HI>Geneva</HI>) with twelve hundred men, ad∣vanced towards the wall of the City without any noise of Drum or Trum∣pet, and an hour before midnight be∣gan the <HI>Scalado,</HI> making use of three Ladders most artificially made, as may be seen at present in the Arsenal, one Father <HI>Alexander</HI> a <HI>Jesuite</HI> standing at the foot of the midle-most and encour∣aging all the Soldiers with assurance of indulgence and pardon in name of the Pope, though the enterprize was at∣tempted without the Popes knowledge. Two hundred and fifty were already got into the City before any perceiv∣ed it; But God Almighty infatuated their Council, seeing they might as easi∣ly have brought in above a thousand;
<PB N="61" REF="34"/>and cut all the Citizens to peices; but by their own oversight, or unskilful∣ness they were discovered three hours before day by a Sentinel from the Tow∣er of the Mint House, the City taking thereupon the Allarm, the bravest and most active Citizens two hours be∣fore day put themselves in Armes, and after some hot skirmishes and brisk fighting, about break of day obtained the Victory and beate out the enemy who had the ill luck that their Petarde, (notwithstanding all their diligence) did no execution, seventeen of the Valientest Citizens were killed, and ten wounded in the action, the ene∣mies had fifty four killed, and thirteen taken Prisoners, some of which were wounded by leaping over the walls, the City Canon having broken their Ladders; early next Morning the Coun∣cil sate to consult what must be done with the thirteen Prisoners, and be∣cause the people cried for Justice, they were all condemned to be hanged, though they were not persons of the least quality in <HI>Savoy,</HI> amongst whom were the Barons of <HI>Sonaz, Attignac</HI> and <HI>Chaffardon.</HI> The Baron of <HI>Attig∣nac</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="35"/>having a broken Legg was carried to the Gallows in a chair, all of them pretended to be used as Prisoners of War, but the City told them they were traitors, peace breakers, and assassins, and used them accordingly, haveing on <HI>Sunday</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>December</HI> about noon caused them all to be hanged; The bodies of those that were hanged, as well as of those that were killed in the action, were pub∣lickly exposed until <HI>Tuesday</HI> the fif∣teenth of the same month, and then their Heads to the number of sixty seven cut off, and placed upon Poles, and their bodies cast into the <HI>Rone,</HI> according to the Sentence pronounced by the Council of sixty, who because they themselves had confessed that their orders were to kill men women and Children without distinction, and to cast their bodies into the same Ri∣ver, thought it just to do unto them, what they intended to have done to o∣thers.</P>
<P>After this, the Peace being broken the <HI>Geneveans</HI> made several incursions into <HI>Savoy,</HI> but in the Month of <HI>July</HI> following, by the Mediation of the
<PB N="63" REF="35"/>seaven neutral <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and the Authority of the most Christi∣an King, which (next to Providence) had the chief influence on the negoti∣ation, peace was concluded betwixt the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the States of <HI>Geneva,</HI> notwithstanding which peace, the Duke afterwards left no means unassayed to surprize the City, but all his industry and attempts have been successless.</P>

<P>As to wealth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches</NOTE> <HI>Geneva</HI> is none of the Richest, though it be Richer at present than it was before the Reformation. It is true some private persons use their utmost endeavours to raise themselves
<PB N="64" REF="36"/>by trading in <HI>Germany, Italy, Hol∣land, Switzerland,</HI> and other Neighbour∣ing places, but the number of Mer∣chants is inconsiderable in respect of the artificers and tradesmen.</P>
<P>The Trade of Bookselling is in great esteem here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Booksellers.</NOTE> and there are some Book∣sellers, who have great stores and va∣riety of books, especially of such as are prohibited of all sorts, and in all Lan∣guages, by reason of the convenience of the Situation of the place, <HI>Geneva</HI> being as it were the centre to <HI>Germa∣ny, France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>There are about seven or eight in <HI>Geneva</HI> who trade for above a hundred thousand Crowns a year, some of which are worth so much, but trade not so openly as others do, and above a hundred Families who live handsom∣ly and commondiously by commerce, but most part of the Towns people are employed in handicraft Trades.</P>
<P><HI>Geneva</HI> hath its Laws and instituti∣ons, by the <HI>Geneveans</HI> called Edicts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws.</NOTE> taken for most part from the Civil law, and the particular customes of the Country, that have been in practice for two, or three hundred years, but
<PB N="65" REF="36"/>in such cases as are not determined by edicts, they have alwaies recourse to the Civil Law; these edicts since they were first collected into a body and published, have been reduced into a better forme and contain two parts, the one concerning the Elections of Magistrates, and their duty, and the other relating to the decision of Ci∣vil causes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Revenue.</NOTE>The publick Revenue of the State amounts to about one hundred thou∣sand Crowns, but the Subjects are not at all burthened, paying only for maintaining of the Guards, and some small duty for Grinding of their Corn, Importation of Wine, and at present a little voluntary Contribution for the fortifications, so that a man for himself and Family of six persons may pay in all ten Crowns a year; such as have real estates pay the accustomed tithes, and Merchants the usual du∣ties.</P>
<P>The publick and ordinary expence is considerable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expences.</NOTE> forty thousand Crowns a year not being sufficient to pay the Sallaries of the Counsellers, Ministers, Professors, Regents, Soldiers, and de∣fray

<P>The Territory of <HI>Geneva</HI> is as health∣full,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Territory.</NOTE> and as fruitful, as it is little and narrow: And therefore most part of the <HI>Geneveans</HI> settle their estates in <HI>Sa∣voy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and pay the same pub∣lick duties as the native subjects of those two Princes do: none of the Neighbour∣ing Princes come near the Territory of <HI>Geneva</HI> for plenty, the <HI>Geneveans</HI> useing all dilligence to supply what it wants in extent, by pains and culti∣vation; so that it produces Corn, Wine, Turnips, Barly, Hay, and all sorts of Graine, the Fruits it com∣monly yields, are Nuts, Apples, Pears Cherries, Almonds, Chesnuts, Apri∣coks, but very few Figs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air.</NOTE>The air is good and healthful, be∣ing purified by the North-wind that frequently blows there, the winter is not so sharp as in <HI>Germany,</HI> and o∣ther Northen Countries, nor the Sum∣mer so hot, as in <HI>Italy</HI> and some pla∣ces of <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> the weather indeed is

<P>Those who have committed any crime, in any other place had not best flie to <HI>Geneva,</HI> for that City is a cage for such as retreat thither, to avoid punishment, and many who have ex∣pected safety, have been so far disap∣pointed, that though they had commit∣ted crimes in remote places, yet at the suite of the plantiffs they have been made prisoners, where they promised themselves all kind of liberty, and af∣terwards brought to Trial and hang∣ed.</P>
<P><HI>Geneva</HI> hath no Soveraign upon earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soverain∣ry.</NOTE> and depends upon none but God Al∣mighty, the Senate having the same authority in their state, that the great∣est Monarch in the world has in his own dominions and are as careful to preserve it.</P>
<P>Strangers who pass through or So∣journe at pensions in <HI>Geneva,</HI> are kind∣ly
<PB N="69" REF="38"/>received by the Inhabitants, and to gratifie them the Senate does affecti∣onately protect them, causing them to be treated with all imaginable civility, insomuch that offences that in other places would be severely punished, are passed over, and connived at in <HI>Geneva,</HI> for the honour and respects sake, which is shewed there to Gentlemen Travel∣ers.</P>
<P>It is a common but false report in <HI>Italy,</HI> that Monks, Friers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religions.</NOTE> Priests of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> are badly used when they pass through <HI>Geneva,</HI> for they themselves find the contrary in their Travels, and if any man should offer insolence to a Priest, or Frier in that City, he would certainly be pun∣ished, nor do the people refuse Charity and lodging to the poor Religious when they demand it.</P>
<P>The rate of pensions for diet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pensions.</NOTE> is com∣monly twelve Crowns a month for the Master, and six for the Servant, but there are inferiour pensions also, to wit, from seaven to eight Crowns a man, and the entertainment according to the price, nevertheless for Gentlemen who expect to be well treated, the
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>lowest is ten and the highest twelve Crowns a month all the City over:</P>
<P>Fishing in the Lake of this City is very considerable both for profit and pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishing.</NOTE> they commonly take trouts of four score pound weight at twelve oun∣ces the pound, and in the midle of the River opposite to the Town pre∣serve their fish alive for use, in two lit∣tle deal board houses made for that purpose.</P>
<P>In the Summer time it is a very plea∣sant recreation to go a Fishing here, and both strangers, and Citizens mighti∣ly delight in it.</P>
<P>All sorts of exercises are taught in this City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exercises.</NOTE> as well as in any other place; there is a good Master for riding the great Horse, and for the first month four Pistols, and three for every month after, he has a Stable very well furnish∣ed with Horses; For Fencing, Dance∣ing, Mathematicks, Geography and the Languages, there is choice of Ma∣sters also, so that Travellers may So∣journe in this City with as much ease to the purse, and advantage for E∣ducation as in most parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inns.</NOTE>There are many Inns and publick
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>Houses here, in all of which as a Tra∣veller is of quality, and intends to or∣der his expences, he will find enter∣tainment answerable to the rate he payes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arms of <HI>Geneva.</HI></NOTE>The Armes of <HI>Geneva</HI> are a half Eagle and Key, the Eagle signifying that the City is Imperial, and the Key, that it hath been an Episcopal See; but the Antient Arms of that City was a Sun, which they still use on a Seal, and has been retained since the time that <HI>Geneva</HI> (as has been al∣ready observed) worshipped <HI>Apollo.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Posts.</NOTE>The <HI>French</HI> Post comes hither twice a weak, to wit on <HI>Monday</HI> at ten of the Clock in the morning, and parts on <HI>Tuesday</HI> at noon, and on <HI>Friday</HI> in the Morning which parts again in the Evening, the price of a single Let∣ter from <HI>Lions</HI> to <HI>Geneva</HI> paying three Solzs.</P>
<P>Twice a week the Messenger or Car∣rier arrives also, his business is to con∣vey to and fro between <HI>Lions</HI> and <HI>Ge∣neva</HI> all sorts of goods, and to con∣duct Strangers that are pleased to Tra∣vel with him, a single person pays him for passage, and entertainment upon
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>the rode about a Pistol, and for every pound of goods at sixteen ounces the pound tow Solzs.</P>
<P>The <HI>German</HI> Post comes in on <HI>Mon∣day</HI> towards Evening, and goes out on <HI>Tuesday</HI> at the same time. The Let∣ters pay more, or less according to the distance of the place from whence they come.</P>
<P>The Post of <HI>Turin</HI> which brings all the Letters of <HI>Italy,</HI> comes in on <HI>Wednesday</HI> and sets out on <HI>Thursday,</HI> but all Letters that are sent by that Post, must be paid for to <HI>Cambray.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hackney Horses and Coaches.</NOTE>There is no want of Hackney Hors∣es nor of Messengers, or Vittorins (as they are called) in <HI>Geneva,</HI> the usual hire of a Horse is twenty Solz a day, such as Travel with the Vittorin pay for all charges, at most half a Pistol a day a peace, and if the Company be greater the rates will be less; you may likewise have Hackney Litters at the rate of a Pistol a day less or more, ac∣cording to the season of the year, or circumstances of the Master. Here are to be had no Hackny Coaches, and there are not above seven or eight per∣sons who keep Coaches in this Town.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="40"/>
<P>Three Faires a year are kept here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faires.</NOTE> to wit on the twenty ninth of <HI>June,</HI> the first of <HI>August,</HI> and the twenty se∣cond of <HI>February;</HI> but they are but ordinary Faires, the Trade running chiefly in beasts, especially Horses and Cattel; there is a Magistrate appoint∣ed over the first to decide the contro∣versies that may happen; each Fair lasts three dayes, and on the second all the Inhabitants are obliged to wear Swords, the Guards of the City and Gates being for Greater security rein∣forced that day.</P>
<P>They have two weekly Markets al∣so, on <HI>Wednesday</HI> and <HI>Saturday</HI> Morn∣ings, which are frequented by vast numbers of <HI>Savoyards</HI> and <HI>French</HI> from the County of <HI>Gez,</HI> who supply the City with all manner of provisions, and buy from thence what they need in the Countrey.</P>
<P>This is all that can be said concern∣ing the State and Government of <HI>Ge∣neva,</HI> but before we bring this little Treatise to a conclusion, It will not be amiss to take some notice of the <HI>French</HI> Kings late resolution of setling a Re∣sident in that City: Whereby, as he
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>had a probable opportunity of intro∣ducing the Mass into that place, so had he a particular design, by making ap∣pear that the protection of that Repub∣lick belonged to him, to put a stop to the pretention of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> who, (especially those of the Canton of <HI>Bearn</HI>) endeavoured in effect under pretence of Friendship and alliance to skrew themselves into a kind of Au∣thority there; insomuch that upon the least occasion they wrote Letters to the Magistrates of <HI>Geneva</HI> in so imper∣ious a style, that they seemed rather to command than entreat. But the <HI>French</HI> (who of late are seldome asleep when their interest lies at stake, and who pretend to sway or give laws to all <HI>Europe</HI>) having the matter in the wind, thought it convenient to send a Resident to <HI>Geneva,</HI> to the end that by exercising there some litte Jurisdicti∣on by which the Law of Nations is al∣lowed to publick Ministers, they might baulk the <HI>Switzers</HI> in their pretensi∣ons, and confirm their King sole Protector of that City and Repub∣lick.</P>
<P>About the end therefore of the year
<PB N="75" REF="41"/>1679, Mounsieur <HI>Chanvigny</HI> was sent Resident to <HI>Geneva,</HI> a man of a low Stature, but hotter temper than well suited with his Age of threescore years. This man having a Son in orders, and in expectation of Preferment, that he might curry favour with the Church∣men, and especially the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> began to exercise his charge with ex∣treme violence, insomuch that not satisfied with the allowance of a Chap∣pel in his own House for his private devotion, he wrote Letters all about, inviting the Catholicks in the Neigh∣bourhood at <HI>Geneva</HI> to come publickly to Mass at his House.</P>
<P>Nor did he stop here, but sollicited all the Curats and Monks in those parts to come and say Mass in <HI>Geneva,</HI> and often employed several of the Jesuits of <HI>Horne</HI> to Preach, inviting all the Neighbouring Catholicks to the exer∣cise. This was so ill relished by the People, that some of the rabble cast of all respect due to a Person of his Character, so that two of them were committed to Prison, being ac∣cused for having fired some Pistol-shot within the Court of the said Resident.
<PB N="76" REF="42"/>The noise of this reaching as far as <HI>Paris,</HI> moved the most Christian King to take information of the matter of Fact, who, thereupon ordered the releasing of the Poisoners, and recalled <HI>Chanvigny</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> sending in his place Monsieur <HI>du Pré,</HI> a person of very great experi∣ence, as the offices which he hath dis∣charged hath sufficiently made appear: And the truth is, this Gentleman lives in very good correspondence, both with the Senate and people; and tho he have Mass said in his House, yet it is with such moderation, as in appear∣ance removes all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>nsie from the minds of the People, who now begin to be acquainted with the freakishness and in constancy of Fortune.</P>
