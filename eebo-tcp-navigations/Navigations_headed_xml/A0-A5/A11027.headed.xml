Also the true Copie of a Lamentable Petiti∣on exhibited in the names of the afflicted Christians in those parts, to the Christian Kingdomes in the VVest.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Ens vnbeléeuing harts hasten too late repentance, and the vnwillingnesse of Christians either to assist other, giues way for Infidels to insult ouer all.</P>
<P>Christs Prophecie is nowe performde, the daies waxe worse and worse, &amp; charitie is growne colde: For if mercie had had any gouernment among Christian men, so many beaute∣ous. Townes, goodly Cities, glorious Kingdomes had not (as nowe they are) either béene vtterly made waste, or suffered the woefull bondage of Turkish
<PB REF="3"/> tyrannie. The flourishing Churches to which Christs Apostles writ, and in which they and the first Fathers of the Church laboured, are now the recep∣tacles of vnhallowed multitudes, and onely a small corner of the earth professeth Christ. One Christian suffering another to be as easilie consumed, as an idle or enuious townesman his neighbour helplesly to be robbed or burned: Els had not all <HI>Asia,</HI> some of <HI>Affricke,</HI> and so much of <HI>Europe,</HI> suffred so great and irrecouerable slauish bondage. Howe many goodly Nations the vnbeléeuing offspring of <HI>Ottoman,</HI> haue subiected, sufficiently too late experience expresseth, and the purpose of the common enemie to subiect the rest, immediate proofe explaineth.</P>
<P><HI>Amurath</HI> now Emperour of <HI>Turkey,</HI> glorying in the vsurped seate of the Greekish Emperre, not long since subiected by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the sonne of <HI>Amurath</HI> his predecessour, ambitiously by his tyrannous Bassaes incited, hath attempted the affliction of <HI>Austria,</HI> the vnconquered part of <HI>Hungarie, Poland, Heluetia,</HI> and other Kingdomes neighbouring <HI>Greece,</HI> whose procéedinges since the 25. of December last, till the middle of Ianuarie, this small Pamphlet handleth.</P>
<P><HI>Rab</HI> is a towne néere <HI>Donow</HI> in <HI>Hungarie,</HI> which in the end of the last Haruest, the Turkes violently after long siege entred, sparing neither age nor sexe, but making the Infants daies equall with the aged Elders, both young and old by their crueltie at once perished. The winning of which place hath not smal∣ly weakned the other Forts of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> in the Chri∣stians power. After they had tyrannously insulted o∣uer <HI>Rab,</HI> they immediatlie bent their forces against <HI>Comar,</HI> the people of which Citie assisted by the hand of God, and resolued rather to die than subiect them∣selues to the slauerie of Infidels, valiantly defended
<PB REF="3"/> themselues, and violently compelled, the huge multi∣tude of the Turkes to raise their siege and retire to <HI>Rab</HI> which they had lately taken. From sundry parts of Christendome since the 25. of December these certaine and vnreprooueable intelligences haue béene sent: <HI>videlicet,</HI> it is certified from Rome the last of Ianuarie.</P>
<P>The Emperours Maiesties Legates had audience before the Pope, who desired a subsidie should be leui∣ed on the Cleargie, for the cutting off of an Arme of the Riuer of <HI>Donow,</HI> that falls in by <HI>Comar,</HI> thereby not only to defend the said towne and the parts there∣abouts, but also to hinder the Turkes from enter∣course to <HI>Oouen:</HI> and besides it would bee a meane to spare many Souldiers that must be imployed in these parts. To this the Pope condiscended; with promise to aide the Emperour with all he might. <HI>Iustiniano</HI> is appointed the Collector.</P>
<P>The same time also it was certified that the great Master of <HI>Malta</HI> was reconciled, béeing authorised from the Pope to be accountable to no Estate.</P>
<P>It is also concluded, that the Prince of <HI>Seuenbergh,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Heluetia,</HI> vpon whose burden the first war betwéene the Turkes and Christians must néedes lye, shall haue 20000. Crownes monthly to maintaine the warre, and if (which God forbid) he be expulsed <HI>Heluetia,</HI> he shall haue some dominion allotted him in the Emperie and 200000. crownes yearely.</P>
<P>Moreouer at <HI>Rome</HI> the same day arriued this newes, that the Archbishop of <HI>Toledo</HI> in Spaine, being ninetie foure yeares of age deceased, and left behinde him a Million of readie money, halfe a Milli∣on in debts, and sixe hundred thousand Crownes in Plate, Roabes, costly apparrell and other Iewels:
<PB REF="4"/> Making fiue Executors; of which the King of Spain is principall, who hath obtained that his money should be imployed to the Churches vse, séeing the saide Archbishop had bequeathed nothing to his kin∣dred, whom belike he prouided for in his life time.</P>
<P><HI>Alberto</HI> the Cardinall succéeding in the Bisho∣pricke and possessing these goods, hath granted halfe of them to be imployed against the Turkes.</P>

<P>Likewise the said 11. of Ianuarie, a Gouernour of horsemen (being in a Hold hard by) required to haue aid: and the Magistrates of <HI>Vienna</HI> haue taken order that euerie Citizen (according to his abilitie) should kéepe a proportion of horse and footmen, till other pre∣paration may be made.</P>
<P>The <HI>Graue Hardigh</HI> beeing taken prisoner by the Turkes, sought to breake prison, his brother hauing prouided a ladder of roapes for his escape, and fortie horse for his rescue: but it was discouered, and they all slaine or taken.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F either humane pi∣tie (naturally graf∣ted in mans heart) to compassionate the oppressed, or the sweete bandes of Christian Loue wherein you &amp; we (members of one head) are mutual∣ly bound either to other: haue anie power to intreate your hartie praiers or speedie help: we humbly beg the one, and beseech the other.</P>
<P>You happie Princes of peopled Kingdomes, and blessed people of those happie Princes: commise∣rate (for CHRISTES cause) our miserable distresse, that haue no day of happines, no night of rest: but feare within, and terror without, dimmes the bright∣nes of our day, and doubles the darknes of our night. We heare, (which addeth heauinesse to our greefe) that ciuill warres, priuate quarrells, and vnchristian malice, weakneth the Arme of Christendome, that should be strengthened among you. Alas, what need yee (like the earth-bred brethren) maliciously let
<PB REF="9"/> cut each others blood? when ye haue a whole world of enemies to warre against: and wee and you in all but a corner of the earth to oppose our selues against their crueltie.</P>
<P>VVe heare how you prouoke (as wee haue done) by the excesse of sinne, Gods wrathfull and heauie vengeance. Let our pride, be a president for you to learne humblenes: our neglect of God, a warning that you leaue such negligence: our wrath, enuie, and auarice, a meane to make you milde, louing and liberall: our sloth, wantonnes and excesse, to increase your diligence, chastitie and temperance. Now for our rich array we put on sackcloath, our beauteous Ladies sit with teare-distained faces, our Virgines sing not the Hymnes of gladnes, but of sorrow, our Old-men faint feebly in the streete, and our Yong∣men prepare themselues to venture their precious liues in open field,</P>
<P>Dere Christian Brethren, turne turne your pity∣ing eyes vppon our prostrate miserie. Remember the willingnes of your fore-fathers in that great Ex∣pedition to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> vnder the leading of <HI>Godfrey</HI> Duke of <HI>Bulloigne.</HI> Then Princes, Noblemen, and well disposed people, came in person from the vt∣most VVesterne Kingdomes, euen from <HI>England, France, Netherland,</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> the women gaue the souldiers their bracelets of gold and siluer, yea, poore seruants offred of their small wages to maine∣taine that holy VVarre. Ah, where is that pitie, care, true loue and mercie now become? The Turkish &amp; vnbeleeuing Enemies are come by manie Kingdoms farre neerer your homes, and your commiseration is by manie degrees farther off. Let <HI>Antioch,</HI> the first Citie wherein the name of Christians began (nowe made a Synagogue of vnbeleeuing Infidels) moue
<PB REF="9"/> ye to compassion. The Candlestickes are remoued from the Churches in <HI>Asia</HI> as S. <HI>Iohn</HI> prophecied: the light of Christianitie is wholly extinct among them. In <HI>Syria</HI> Christs Spouse hath lost her beautie. In the Emperie of <HI>Greece,</HI> Kingdomes of <HI>Epyrus, Lystria, Crete, Cyprus,</HI> and other the Mediterranean Nati∣ons, CHRIST had (&amp; that within these few yeres) his beloued Vineyard, planted, tended, wel dressed, compassed about. But now the Turkes (like wilde Boares are entred, the Vineyard is wasted. In stead of wine, the earth (in all those and diuers other king∣domes) is drunke with Christian blood: and there is no face of Christianitie left, no outward Church. Let that part of our Kingdomes alreadie lost, &amp; the rest now hazarding, win ye to some compassion.</P>
<P>But it may be, because the Turke is farre off, you thinke he neuer can haue power to hurt ye, you and your children shall be safe. Be not so grose conceip∣ted. Consider, wee had Fathers that gathered for vs, so had the <HI>Greekes,</HI> and other the forenamed Na∣tions: but now their welth and ours lies open to the Enemie. VVe had houses, but Turkes posses them: Pallaces, but they are spoyled: Churches, but they are prophaned: Cities, but they are wasted: &amp; some more we haue, but how long they shalbe ours, we li∣tle know. And yet within these few yeres, wee were thrice farther off from daunger than you now are. Neither flatter your selues that your Countryes are populous, your Cities strong, your Kingdomes fen∣ced with the Sea: they and we had peopled King∣domes, fenced Cities, sea-walled Ilands, but all was vaine, they were singled one by one, their neighbors denied them helpe, and first they, then those deniers perished. Such will our case be, if we be not aided: such will yours be, if ye doo not aid vs.</P>

<P>Besides, there is a rumour spred in some partes of Christendome, how the Turkes are iust in keeping faith and promise. O fond and idle beliefe: What faith can they keepe that haue no faith?</P>
<P>Such faith as not long since they kept with that noble Christian Prince of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> the Turkish Em∣perour himselfe passing his word vnto him. When that most Princely Christian VVarriour, had defen∣ded <HI>Famagosta</HI> till all munition and vittaile failed: hee and his small companie yet worthely resoluing, intended deerely to sel their liues, and stood valiant∣ly to defend the breaches. The Turke seeing their resolution, offred the Prince, that if hee would sur∣render the Citie, himselfe and the souldiers, wyth theyr Armes, weapons, and colours displaied, the Princesse with her children, the other women, peo∣ple, and children of the Citie with bag and baggage should passe quietly through the Turkes Armie, and bee transported to what Hauen in Christendome they desired. The Prince accepted these conditions, the Turkish Emperor confirmed them with an: oath: but (like a false miscreaunt) when they were issued, hee compelled the Prince and the able men to beare burthens of earth vppon their shoulders to repayre the breaches: then commaunded the Princesse, her children, the women and other weake people (after manie shamefull abuses) to be cruelly tortured to death. Then stripped they the Souldiers and chay∣ned them for slaues. Lastly they puld out the wo∣full Princes eyes, punched his warlike bodie full of hoales, and hangd him on the top mast of their Ad∣mirall Galley, more to afflict his poore subiects that rowed there as slaues.</P>
<P>Such faith will they keepe as with the last Empe∣rour of <HI>Greece</HI> they did: whom (after many frendly
<PB REF="10"/> seeming Ambassades) they sodainly besieged in his chiefe Citie <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and in the chiefe Gate of that Citie, he and his children were found mangled wyth manie wounds, and trampled with their hor∣ses feete.</P>
<P>Such faith will they keepe as lately they did wyth vs of <HI>Hungarie:</HI> Hauing taken certaine yongmen of noble Families. Wee laboured for their libertie to the Bassa of <HI>Buda.</HI> Their ransome was set downe, and license granted for their frends to bring it. The Bassa himselfe receiued it: and then tyrannouslie to seuerall stakes he tyed the miserable yong Gentle∣men naked, and in presence of their friends caused their bodies to be sliced with sharpe kniues, the flesh cast vnto hungrie dogs, and the dead carcasses deli∣uered their sorrowfull friends for the raunsome they had paid.</P>
<P>This is the Turkish faith, this their vow, this their religion: let no Christian State beleeue them, nor for lucre hold league with them, for they doo await time first to destroy vs, then to extirpate them.</P>
<P>What should wee say that you cannot conceiue, looke on your Cities, Pallaces, Fieldes, Meadowes, walkes, pleasant Gardens, thinke ours were like yours, but nowe are nothing but receptacles of sor∣row. Looke on your wiues and beauteous daugh∣ters, and remember that we haue such (though not so fortunate) yours safe, ours subiect to rauishment and spoile. Looke on your sonnes and forget not ours, of whom no small number are alreadie with their wofull fathers chained in Turkish slauerie, the rest opposing themselues against their tyrannie. And then remember it is in his quarrell wee striue, that hath promised to reward a cup of colde water giuen in his name: much more reward againe with tenne
<PB REF="11"/> folde blessings, your Christian mercie and pittie to∣ward vs.</P>
<P>To him that is able to helpe as well by one as ma∣nie, we commit ourselues: and commend the con∣sideration of our miserable estate to your Christian Charities.</P>
