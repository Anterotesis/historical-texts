<PB REF="4"/>was to murder the two chiefe Iustices, &amp; all the Privy Coun∣sell that were Protestants, likewise to seaze upon all the Kings Ports, Castles, and Magazins whatsoever, and to murder all persons that should oppose them in their intentions and de∣signes.</P>

<ITEM N="4">4. <HI>The City and Castle of Dublin, First if they could get the Castle, they then would make the City yeeld presently, by shooting from the Castle the tops of the chin∣neys to affright them, but if that prevailed not, they would batter downe their houses about their eares, the Lord chiefe Justices and privy Councellors, sate in Con∣sultation all night, for the safe-guard and security of the City, and Castle of Dublin, and the next morning they apprehended many of these Traytors, together with the Lord Matquers, who the day before, had forsaken his Lodgings, and hid himselfe in a Garret, there were found at his Lodgings great store of skaines, Hammers
<PB REF="4"/>and Hatchets without halves, the same day newes was brought to</HI> Dublin, <HI>that severall places and Forts was seized upon in</HI> conno, <HI>and</HI> monno, <HI>and in divers other places, many Villages plundered, whereupon</HI> 500 <HI>horse and</HI> 500 <HI>foote were raised to guard the city. and</HI> 100 <HI>put into the Castle under the command of Sir</HI> Fran∣cis Willoughby, <HI>for the defence and safety of the Castle.</HI></ITEM>

<P>This Conspiracy was first revealed to Sir <HI>John Bur∣lacy,</HI> and other Justices of the Peace, by one who was servant to Sir <HI>John Clotworthy</HI> an Irish Knight, and a Parliament man.</P>
<P>It is reported that some of these Rebels confessed they were to have an Army of 7000 men from seve∣rall parts of Ireland, which should be all Papists and Jesuites, and to surprise all the fortes and Castles a∣bout <HI>Dublin,</HI> and to cut the throates of the chiefest Noble-men, Gentry, and others of this Kingdome that then were present.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Dublin</HI> and the Townes and Castles adjoyning is in very great danger, they are gathered to a strong head, still approaching neerer unto it, ta∣king Townes and Castles in severall Provinces where they fall, plundering all places they come into, the Murders and out-rages daily committed by them, is great and intolerable, the Tyrannicall power they ex∣ercise upon the poore <HI>Protestants,</HI> not to be parral∣lel'd, amongst Pagans or Infidels, so farre doe these bloody Miscreants degenerate from the name of Chri∣stians; Thus much have I thought good to informe you of the miserable estate and condition of this Kingdome at this present.</P>
