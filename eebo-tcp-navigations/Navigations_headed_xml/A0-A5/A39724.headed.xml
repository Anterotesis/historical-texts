<P>TIs for no vaunt nor boast that I write my Travails (I esteeming my self (I can assure thee) a far lesse Travailer now (having sail'd of seeing the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and consequently all the Eastern Monarchies) than I did when I past over Seas to <HI>Zeland</HI> first) but to satisfie the curiosity of some noble friends, and make honourable mention of o∣thers, to whom I am infinitely obliged, (so thou wilt find whilst I make but slight menti∣on of those, I am most acurate in mentioning these) nor is it vani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in me, that I make men∣tion of so many, and noble ones, all that know me, knowing I never willingly converse but with the noblest in every place, finding them still in every respect the best; besides, since <HI>Fortune</HI> maim'd me, and brought me to my Crutches, whom should I rely upon but the best able to support me? which they the more wil∣lingly do (perhaps) because I lean so light∣ly on them, and alwayes strive to afford them some pleasure for the profit I receive of them.
<PB REF="4"/>
And thus much for that, for the following Letters, I must advertise thee, that most of those writ abroad are but translated out of the several Languages I writ them in originally, nor art thou to imagine them lesse <HI>English</HI> for that, there being as much difference betwixt the <HI>Authors</HI> translating his own conceptions, and those of an others, as betwixt a <HI>Prētises</HI> copying, and a <HI>Painters</HI> drawing the same piece agen, the one having a dead Copy for imitation, the others pieces being all drawn upon the life.

<HEAD>The Character of the Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI></HEAD>
<P>He was the fullest Man of all the Eminent parts and qualities of a Great Minister of State, as <HI>England</HI> ever bred, and both in <HI>Ca∣binet,</HI> and abroad, exprest it as fully too; his unhappinesse 'twas, (or rather ours) that he liv'd not in happier Times (might have rather Admir'd, than Envyed those parts of his) so as that Epitaph of <HI>Adrian</HI> the 6th, might well be applyed to him, <HI>Proh! dolor quantum refert in que Tempora vel optimi cujusque virtus inci∣dat.</HI> Many Envyed him, because few under∣stood him, and 'tis almost to be wisht that his Prince had not don't so well, since 'twas his overthrow (so much more it imports the Peo∣ple than the Prince be Good, they being many, and he but one.) He was a Iewel sit for the Crown of any Prince to wear, and that his Prince well knew, and therefore wore him him there; but being matcht, and overmatcht too with counterfeit ones, they fearing his splendor should dim and offuscat them, snacht him thence▪ and cast him into the obscurity of
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
a Prison, from whence he might have escap'd, had he preferr'd his Life before his Fame; but he had higher Thoughts, and look't only af∣ter <HI>Eternitie,</HI> and the perpetuating his Memo∣ry; so while 'twas irreparable losse unto the Crown, 'twas his gain to die with the glorious title, and high reputation of his <HI>Princes Mar∣tyr.</HI> Nor wanted there as great prodigies at his death, as ever fore-run any <HI>Heroes</HI> yet, all the Laws of the Land being first subverted, the King losing his Authority, and Kingdom chang'd into <HI>Democra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie,</HI> Er' he could die: so as his noble House was more honour'd and il∣lustrated by his fall, than ever't could have been, even in his greatest rise.</P>
<P>And now (my Lord) comfort your self, if you chance to be the next, that you shall not want one to make your <HI>Epitaph,</HI> and <HI>Cha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acter</HI> at least; but I rather wish and hope 't may be your <HI>Elogium,</HI> in celebration of your Glorious Actions.

Nor mean I all Men neither, but only your young Gallants of the Time, who have little

they gentlely give you their opinions, and let you retain your own; they pursue not con∣tention, but Truth, and have no Author to maintain beyond it; their Vertue is charming, and Honour without boast; and finally, 'tis pleasure, not pain, to converse with them. I grant you, they have their Imperfections too, but they are noble ones, and their Birth, their Education, and the modesty of their Sex, makes them nothing, in comparison with those of men; For example, an Oath, an Obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene word with them is horror and blasphemie, that is but sport and gallantry with Men.

But I will tell you now, in confidence, my Reason for't. Tis no Inconstancy, but rather a constancy to my first Resolution of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lying war and trouble, makes me now resolve to leave this Coun∣try, and travel into <HI>Italy</HI>; Nor could I excuse it to mine own Country, should I longer stay here, where the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Hollander</HI> be∣twixt them, wast and consume this Country; just like a Taper lighted at both Ends; nor is there any retreat here from the noise of Warr and Tumult, every place being Frontire to some
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
Enemy or other; nay the very Walls of some Towns (so narrowly they are prest) frontire unto both. Mean time, imagine with what heart I can behold so many noble creatures (so nobly obliging me) suffering under so many heavy Calamities, one's Territory spoyl'd, an others Castles raz'd unto the ground, and all reduc'd by it to such want and povertie, as I heard a Great <HI>Princesse</HI> say not long since, af∣ter she had reform'd her House and Family al∣most to a fourth part, That she fear'd she should be forc'd to Spinn to maintain the rest. Yet do they venture Lives &amp; Fortunes here to maintain their King in possession of his own, whilst better cheap they might be subject to an other Prince, and change hands, only by crossing of their Arms, and sitting still (a rare Example of Loyalty in Subjects now adayes.) <HI>Italy</HI> then, being the only Country now free from Wars, and the miseries it brings in train of it, thither I resolve to go, in search of that Peace all Countrys have lost but it. And if you ask me, with what heart I can leave this Noble Company, I am so much obliged unto? Truly, just with such an one as I should depart with Life, or whatever were dearer unto me then it; Nor could I ever resolve to do it, without hope of returning soon again, and some sudden change of Fortune. Mean time, part of my Grief, and resentment of my depar∣ture, I have endeavoured to expresse in this following copy of Verses, which, cause

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Touching the state of her Affairs.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter long poring in the dark, I begin at last to perceive some light in your High∣nesse affairs here, and to find how his High∣nesse Agents negotiation here, is more to take off the Excommunication, than to procure a Divorce from the first Mariage, or Ratificati∣on of the last; and this I came to light of by this occasion: I recommending your Affairs the other day to the <HI>Dutchesse Matthei,</HI> one who can do all here, his Holinesse Governing <HI>Rome, Donna Olympia</HI> him, and she <HI>Donna O∣lympia.</HI> She most readily undertook it, first, for your Highnesse sake, next for her Brothers, and lastly perhaps for mine, (I having the ho∣nour

to wait often upon her) commanding me to bring my Man, and his businesse should be dispatcht. Whereupon I joyfully ran to inform his Highnesse Agent of what had past, imagining he would have run as joyfully to imbrace the occasion, when contrary to my expectation, I found him nothing mov'd with it all, rather surpriz'd, confus'd and Interdict, and so cold (in fine) as conecting delays unto delays, at last he absolutely refus'd to goe, less he had his Highnesse warrant first, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h ex∣cuse appear'd to me frivolous; for if he had order to do the thing, (as now I suspected he had none) what need he further order to do it well? This suspition shortly after grew up to certitude, when discoursing with Cardinal <HI>Caraffa</HI> about your Highnesse affairs, and recommending to him the Iustice of your cause, and expedition of the <HI>Rhota,</HI> He an∣swered me, with the prudence of an <HI>Italian,</HI> and franchize of a <HI>Germain,</HI> (with whom he was <HI>Nuntius,</HI> when I had the honour to know him first) that I urg'd the expedition of an affair, wherein they should disoblige both the Emperour and the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> without so much as gratifying the Duke himself, who being the main party, sollicited it not at all; Whereupon I wondred at mine own blindness all this while, not to have perceiv'd, how whilst the <HI>Emperour</HI> embrac'd Prince <HI>Francis</HI> Intrest, (who had put himself under his Protection) and the Crown of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance</HI> (for the same Reasons)

<HEAD>XVII. To the Count <HI>Salazar,</HI> from <HI>Genoa, Anno</HI> 48.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Reduction of NAPLES, and some passages concerning it.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF the Reduction of <HI>Naples,</HI> I gave you advertisement by my last from <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence I departed just upon the advice there, Embarquing in the Popes Galleys at <HI>Civita Vecchia,</HI> together with the Marquisses <HI>Iean Baptista,</HI> and <HI>Felice Mario,</HI> with the Marquesse <HI>Spinelli,</HI> recommended particularly to them by the Marquesse <HI>de Buffalo,</HI> and trea∣ted by them with all noble courtesie: Our Navigation being so speedy, and prospe∣rous, as in lesse than three days we arrived at <HI>Genoa</HI>; on the way we met with the Duke of <HI>Tursi</HI> comming from <HI>Naples,</HI> who confir∣med all I writ unto you, as did likewise your Ambassadour Signior <HI>Roncilio</HI> at <HI>Genoa,</HI> we conferring Letters together, and he ma∣king solemn bonfires for the news; yet do the <HI>French</HI> report the contrary, the best Archi∣tectures in the world of false rumours, when it makes for their advantage, as does this, they knowing how 'tis only the first reports of ill news, that dismays, astonishes, and disanimates,
<PB N="43" REF="26"/>
which if you can divert and damp a while, people are nothing near so struck and startled with it afterward; which false rumours I tracted from the very Fountain, finding them on the <HI>Friday</HI> after, the day before the General Postday; impoysoning with it all the pub∣lique places of <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence news is derived, and flowes abroad in the World.</P>
<P>The Copy of that Letter Count <HI>de Ogniato</HI> thought fit to make use of, to injealouse the <HI>Nea∣politans,</HI> upon the arrival of the Duke <HI>Guise,</HI> as written from <HI>France</HI> intercepted and interpre∣ted, is thus.</P>
<P><Q>Behold the best sport in the world for us, our Enemies fighting against our Enemies; to prevail our selves of this occasion, you must be sure to keep the parties so equally ballan∣ced, one mayn't destroy to ther, but with its own destruction; wherefore if you find the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> too weak, you may strengthen them with small succours; if too strong, you may weaken them, with drawing them out in small factions, ever keeping your main de∣sign secret, till they be both so weakned, you may easily make an absolute conquest of ei∣ther; Let the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> then be <HI>precau∣tioned</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Alansons</HI> ill successe at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> In discovering his designs too soon, and allaruming them by it, to unite forces as against a common Enemy; whence I wonder why he proclaimes so loud his de∣scendency from the house of <HI>Anjou</HI>; enough
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>
to waken their jealousies, that he intends to set on foot the Title of that house again; pray let him be advised of it. More Instru∣ctions you need not; all being compriz'd in this only, that you look upon the <HI>Neapoli∣tans</HI> as wild beasts, that may be <HI>subdued,</HI> but never <HI>tamed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This published amongst them work't such effect, as out of this Letter they sinisterly inter∣preted all the Duke of <HI>Guizes</HI> Actions, every thing he did, stumbling them afterwards, just like <HI>French</HI> Posthorses, who stumbling once, never leave running headlong till they be down. Thus you see (My Lord) how little things sometimes (which History never menti∣ous) confer mainly to the performance of greater ones; and the smallest occasions as hinges somtimes serve to turn the world; No more; but my most humble service, and best respects to your self, your Noble Lady, and Monsieur <HI>Recourt,</HI> &amp;c. being</P>

<P>THere are some places, as some persons, better agreeing with our Genius and disposition than others; and if ever there were any that agreed not with mine, 'twas <HI>Rome,</HI> where one cannot stand without supplanting, speak without Caution, nor live without extreme Industry, all is Insidiousness, all shoving and shouldring, and all sollici∣ting, making businesse of every thing, and then following close that businesse; which considered, 'tis no wonder I ne∣ver agreed with it, nor it with me: Nor need I goe so far as the stars with the <HI>Astrono∣mer</HI> to find the cause of it; for when good fortune falls, I cannot crowd and shove to catch it: I had rather be silent than be solici∣tous what to say, nor am I busie body enough to have a head fit for businesse, and for Indu∣stry 'tis not in my Nature, nor I can no more change my disposition of mind, than my linea∣ments of body. This I say, to let you know, that as I liv'd, so I came a discontented person from <HI>Rome,</HI> which I declare on every occasion,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of his Sea Voyage from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to the <HI>BRASILS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOme week after we set sayl at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> we a∣riv'd at the <HI>Madera's</HI> (one of the <HI>Affrique</HI> Ilands) where landing at <HI>Funchal</HI> (the chief City, or <HI>Bishops</HI> seat) we were kindly enter∣tain'd by the Merchants there, contending in
<PB N="60" REF="35"/>
<HI>Hospitalitie</HI> who should first lodge and enter∣tain us, (as the manner is, where provisions are plenty, and Strangers rare) here we staid some 4 or 5 dayes feasted and regaled every day, and presented at our departure with the rarities of the <HI>Isle,</HI> they making the best <HI>con∣fectures</HI> in the world, both for dry and wet, <HI>Sugar</HI> growing there in great abundance, and their <HI>Wines</HI> surpassing for <HI>Generous</HI> all that e∣ver I tasted yet: when prosecuting our voyage, after a few dayes sayl we had a sight of the <HI>Ca∣naries</HI> or Fortunate Ilands, where under the <HI>pick</HI> of <HI>Teneriff</HI> we lay some dayes becalmed, it being one of the highest mountains in the world, all green unto the Top, and of so equal an Ascent, that those of <HI>Babel</HI> might have innocently built their <HI>Tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> there, secure from <HI>Deluge,</HI> and did it extend itself a little higher, one could not imagine a more pleasant nor ea∣sier passage unto Heaven. From thence we say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d along the coast of <HI>Affrique,</HI> towards the Islands of <HI>Capo verte,</HI> which we past with∣out touching at them, the Air being general∣ly held <HI>unwholsom,</HI> but at that Season <HI>Infecti∣ous</HI>; after which, steering our course West∣ward towards the <HI>Brasils,</HI> and once past all comerce the land has with the Sea, of common air, and repercussion of waves, &amp;c. we had the pleasantest Voyage as could be imagined, no storms, the Winds (which surely on those Seas blow all from Land) hardly having breath enough (for the long Voyage they had made)
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
to fill our sayls, and the air so pure, as in comparison with the pleasure of it there, it seemes a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>paine</HI> to breath on Land, where the air is stuffing, suffocating, and noisom, tainted as it passes with Ordures and Filth, (there being few Countryes like <HI>Arabia,</HI> af∣fording more sweets than stenches) whereas that of the Sea comes purely (as it were) drayn'd and purified by the Sun-beams, as it passes to the sence. Then for other plea∣sures, you have none on <HI>Land,</HI> but we had some at Sea to equal it; and to begin with the most incredible, Hawking and Hunting. (besides Fishing) we had perpetually for more than a moneth together. Our ship be∣ing all incompast with <HI>Dorado's</HI> or shining Fishes (somwhat like <HI>Dolphins</HI>) hunting the Flying Fishes, which you might see on Top of the water, fluttering to escape, and the <HI>Do∣rado's</HI> bounding to overtake them, till being hard pursued, and so near prest, as they were in danger to be ta'n, the poor flying Fish would get on wing, and flying one danger, incurre another; for a slight of Sea fowl (call'd <HI>Booby's</HI> by the <HI>English</HI>) followed us all the way hovering in the air, in expectance of their prey, seeing the flying fish on wing, would stoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at them, and each one singling out one, flye them to a mark. Then for Fishing, our Mariners had but only to choose out their <HI>Do∣rads</HI> (as a good Woodman would a Dear) and strike him straight with his <HI>Fisgigg</HI> (or Dart
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
with many barbed heads) never failing of their Cast, and this furnished us with fresh Fish all the time, it being excellent meat, short and crisp like our <HI>Salmons,</HI> and much like them in bignesse; which being ta'n, strange it was to behold the curious colours of its scales, fading by degrees, as death won on life, (just as the skies colour does when night comes on) till quite dead it became all black, with good rea∣son, it putting on mourning for its death, whose life had cloath'd it in such rich and glit∣tering colour. An other sort of Fish we took call'd the <HI>Shark</HI> or <HI>Tuberon,</HI> black and great as a <HI>Porpoise,</HI> with terrible long Teeth, huge wide jaws, and so ravenous, as at a bit 'twould snatch a <HI>Legg</HI> or <HI>Arm</HI> away of any it found swimming in the Sea; these have certaine little Fishes called the <HI>Pilot Fish,</HI> cleaving to them so fast by a <HI>Fynn</HI> o'th' top of the head, you can hardly separate them by any force: they have great heads, some spann long of body, and are excellent meat. Nor wanted we the pleasure of Gardens too at Sea, the Ocean (for many hundred miles from Land, and many miles together) being all cover'd over with a certain <HI>Green,</HI> so thick as the Ship could hardly make way tho∣rough it, with many <HI>Gridiline</HI> Flowers be∣sides like our <HI>Crocus's,</HI> rendring it a most delightfull spectacle. Then for o∣ther prospect, do but behold the rising and setting Sun, and you should see a

hundred several forms and figures, like your scenes in Masques and playes, with lights be∣hind them, reflecting them to the Eye, and betwixt light and shadow, setting them off more resplendently to the view. For other commodities and delicacies you have on Land, we wanted none, Our great Cabines being large as your Chambers, our Beds as commo∣dious, our Decks spacious as your Galleries to walk in, our Kitchin our Sellars as well furnished, heards of Swine, flocks of Sheep, and Pullen of all sorts aboard, perpetually fea∣sting, nor wanted we Musick to our Feast, (besides an excellent set of Trumpets) the Mariners having some <HI>Fiddles</HI> amongst them, to which they often danc'd to delight the Pas∣sengers. And thus sleeping, eating, drinking, and recreating our selves, we made our voy∣age secure from storms, secure from Pirats and Enemies, till making Land about <HI>Capo St. Augustine,</HI> we might de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cry some 3 or 4 sail which knowing to be <HI>Hollanders</HI> of <HI>Fernambucca,</HI> and not willing to encoun∣ter them, we steered to Seaward again, being that night overtaken by one of them, who allarumn'd us as if their whole Fleet had made after us, appearing on every side of us with fiers on his main Mast, and about the wast of his ship perpetually burning (as a call it seems for his Companions, if any were in sight) sayling away in the morning to find them out, and returning towards Evening,

(ever endeavouring like a Kite to snatch a∣way our <HI>Carvel</HI> and <HI>Pattachio,</HI> which lay like Chickens close under our Wings) till at last, about the height of <HI>Baia,</HI> it left us, despairing to meet any of their Fleet higher up, when holding on our course for the <HI>Rio,</HI> and soun∣ding all the way, we found it a bold Coast, some 35 Fathom all the way, with neither Flats nor Rocks, so passing by <HI>Capo Frio</HI> (so call'd from the excessive cold there, though under the Torrid Zone, and the climate on either side be exceeding hot) at last we arri∣ved before the mouth of St. <HI>Sebastians</HI> Haven, where under a little Isle we cast Anchor, ha∣ving in lesse than three moneths, deducting our stay in <HI>Assrique,</HI> made the voyage almost to the <HI>Antipodes,</HI> of 4 ships (as we were) and more than 4 hundred men, losing only one man in all the voyage; and here let me cast Anchor too, er' I prosecute my voyage.</P>

For their <HI>Caijus,</HI> it is a sort of Tree of the bignes of our ordinary Apple-trees, the leaves like chesnut leaves, and fruit much like the bigger sort of green Figs, fastned to the Tree in lieu of stalk, by certain Chesnuts, which roasted are excellent meat, the fruit ea∣ten whole, melts all away to juice, exceeding cooling and refreshing, excepting certain strings which hang in your teeth, so tough, you cannot swallow them.

Another sort of Fruit they have call'd <HI>Mamons,</HI> growing like great green pears, some 20 or more in cluster on the top of the Tree, never ariving to the maturity of being eaten raw, but they make a good conserve.

Your <HI>Hamatta</HI> is a certain <HI>cot∣ton</HI> Net about the bignesse of a <HI>Blancket,</HI> drawn together at each end, and fastned by a strong Line to a Cane as big and long as a Colstaff, carryed on their Shoulders, where you sit or lye in what posture you please on a Boulster or Pillow, far more easily than in a∣ny <HI>Licter</HI> (the <HI>Portuguez</HI> men having a Negro carrying a <HI>Parasol</HI> or <HI>Umbrella</HI> to shadow them from the Sun, whilst the Women are shadowed and defended from publique sight, by some rich coverture thrown over the <HI>Ha∣matta,</HI> with two Negro Maids going by their sides, to help them up, and put on their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hop∣pinas</HI> when the Net's laid down, and they rise to go out of it to any place.

<HEAD>Of the Commodities of the Country.</HEAD>
<P>From my Voyage, I will return to speak of the Riches of the Country, chiefly consisting in their Sugar, which when I have named, I have named all; not that it wants others, but that it can want no others, having that, since that country which abounds with that com∣modity which all others have need of, can ne∣ver want any commodity which others abound withall. For the rest, it produces neither <HI>Corn,</HI> nor <HI>Wine,</HI> nor <HI>Salt,</HI> which I attribute not so much to the difference of the Climate, as some politique reason to keep them with that necessary dependency on <HI>Portugal,</HI> to vent their commodities, and prevent revolt. Now for their Sugar thus it grows, and thus 'tis made; Their Sugar canes are prun'd to the heighth of standing corn: nor need they other culture, but every second year to cut them close by the roots, as we do <HI>Osiers,</HI> when a∣gainst the next year they never fail to spring up agen, the flaggs of which Canes are of a plea∣sant green, and shew a far off just like a Field of Corn, which being ripe about the month of <HI>Iune,</HI> they joint them in pieces some foot¦long, and carry them to the Mill, turn'd by <HI>Oxen,</HI> or <HI>Water,</HI> consisting of two round <HI>Cylinders,</HI> about the bignesse of <HI>Mil-posts,</HI> pla∣ted

with Iron, which turning inwards, and joyning as close together as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y can meet, so squeez the canes in passing through them, as they come out on th'other side all bruzed, and dry as <HI>keques,</HI> which were all liquid before; which <HI>Liquor</HI> is conveyed by <HI>Troughs</HI> to cer∣tain <HI>Caldrons,</HI> wher 'tis boyl'd, still retaining its <HI>amber</HI> colour, till powr'd out at last into their <HI>forms</HI> or coolers, with a certain <HI>Lee</HI> 'tis rendred white; And in these <HI>Mills</HI> (during the season of making Sugar) they work both day and night, the work of immediatly applying the canes into the <HI>Mill</HI> being so perillous as if through drousinesse or heedlessnesse a fingers end be but engag'd betwixt the Posts, their whole body inevitably follows, to prevent which, the next <HI>Negro</HI> has alwayes a Hatchet readie to chop off his Arm, if any such Mis∣fortune should arive.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Starrs, and Heavens of the other Hemisphere.</HEAD>
<P>I will conclude this Treatise of <HI>Brasil</HI> with a word or two of the <HI>Starrs</HI> of the other <HI>He∣misphere,</HI> garnisht with many <HI>constellations</HI> wholly unknown to us, of which the <HI>Cruciero</HI> or <HI>Crosse</HI> is the principalst, consisting of 5 or 6 <HI>Stars</HI> of the first magnitude, as bright as any in our <HI>Hemisphere</HI>; whose brightnesse, as with a foil, is set off the more by a great black cloud

that's continually under it, as is the whitnesse of the <HI>Milky way</HI> rendred more perspicuous, by a streak of black in the midst of it, tending towards the same <HI>constellation</HI>; both which, as also another great black cloud on th'other side the <HI>Milkie way,</HI> I observ'd at my being there, for more than six months continually: whence I concluded, 'twas the natural complexion of that sky (as ours is blew) to have much part of it black, which perhaps renders the people of that Climat far more melancholy than ours, which black clouds I much wonder none (as I know of) has observ'd besides my self, especially since there ar 2 white clouds not far from the <HI>Cruciero</HI> appearing always in the same posture and figure, so generally observ'd and known, as they are call'd <HI>Nubes Magellanicae,</HI> from <HI>Ma∣gellan,</HI> who first discovered them.

<PB N="86" REF="48"/>
diminishing the Royal Authority, as on the contrary it rendred it, but the more absolute, whence they were deceived, who imagined the Parlament there an imperious Maister, as 'tis in some Countries, or an abject Vassal, as it is in others; it being rather in nature of an humble frend, to advise and counsel as often as was requisite for the Kingdoms good; That there are some things which like the wheels of Chariots, or wings of Birds, look like bur∣thensom; when indeed they are but helps to support and lighten the burthen, and one of those things was the Parlament of <HI>England</HI>; not so much an Embarasment to the Royal power, as an expediating and faciliating it, not so much to Limit the Regal Authority, as not to leave it altogether Limitlesse, that its bounds was like that of the <HI>Ocean,</HI> boundles, but for its own conservation, that the King could do all things, but ruine and destroy himself and his Kingdoms, an Impuissance so far from Im∣perfection, as is that of <HI>Almighty God</HI> not be∣ing able to sin, which is on the contrary one of his most God-like Attributes. In fine, that the King of <HI>England</HI> was one of the <HI>potentest</HI> Kings in the Christan world, but with his Par∣lament <HI>omnipotent,</HI> and that without that he was but one 'tis true; but that without him no∣thing. For the rest of our affairs, his Religi∣on had rendred him more intelligent; and he could say, That as 'tis not then when the House falls, that the ruin begins, but when

some main pillar or foundation is neglected, the want of maintaining which, draws on the Ruine of all the rest: So 'twas not now the Ruine of the Royal Authority began in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but then when the Schism began; when that foundation of Monarchy, <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r me Reges regnant,</HI> was so shaken and weaken'd, as it has stood wavering and tottering ever since. That the Spiritual and Temporal Monarchy are that <HI>Murale</HI> and <HI>Antemurale,</HI> fortifying one another; neither could the one more subsist without the other, than the Walls of a Town without its <HI>Bulwarks</HI> and <HI>Outworks</HI> can defend it self. That so the King, in taking the Eccle∣siastical Authority upon himself, did but like him who foolishly took his Horse on his own shoulders, and fell to the ground with't, whilst he vainly indeavoured to carry that, whith should carry him; and so we see all had fayl'd in their Ends they propos'd to themselves in that preposterous change; the King in establishing a greater Autho∣rity, the <HI>Bishops,</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Lords,</HI> in i∣magining they should grow more absolute by the ejection of <HI>Abbots</HI>; and the <HI>Lords Temporal</HI> by the ejection of <HI>Bishops</HI> after∣wards, all but making way for their own ruine; nor were the Commons to imagine they had much mended their Mercat by it;

The next is the influ∣ence they have, according as their Countryes, Border and Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne one upon another, or by <HI>flux</HI> and <HI>reflux</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI>; The Italian for example being more Current in <HI>Turky</HI> than the <HI>French,</HI> for the first reason: As the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="58"/>
(for the second) is more current than the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> there. The last is concerning your subor∣dinate Languages, as the <HI>Walloon</HI> and <HI>Liegois</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Portuguez</HI> to the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> to <HI>English,</HI> &amp;c. all which under∣stand you in speaking the chief or Master Lan∣guage, but not o'th contrary, and all these your Master Language says use but their old absolet words, as Servants wear their Masters old Garments, but they (too proud to acknow∣ledge this) say rather, that as old men keep constant to their old fashions, whilst their Sons refine dayly upon them in bravery, and change for new, so the plainesse of their Lan∣guage, is but an Argument of the antiquity thereof. To conclude (<HI>Madamoiselle</HI>) 'twould be difficult for me to tell you which of these Languages serv'd me most in travelling about the world, were not the <HI>French</HI> that I have the happinesse to converse with you in, whom I esteem above all the world besides, to that therefore I must give the preeminence, and subscribe as I do this Letter, with the Assu∣rances that I am</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Fame.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madamoiselle,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COnsidering the mighty <HI>Elogiums</HI> and magnificent prayses that has ever been gi∣ven to Fame by all Kingdomes and Republi∣ques on th'one side, the airinesse and the Fabulousnesse of it on th'other side, it makes me half suspect that there is more of <HI>Policy</HI> than <HI>Reality</HI> in the thing; for who would doe great and noble Actions? who would expose their lives for their Countries? if somewhat beyond their Lives did not excite them to't? If the memory of what they did were termi∣nated with themselves, or that memory no∣thing appertained to them when they were gon, Hence 'tis, that this is used as a spur to incite men unto Vertue; 'Tis Fames Trumpet, that encourages men, and edges them to valor, and the sound of this like that of <HI>Meltiades</HI> Trophies to <HI>Themistocles,</HI> is still resounding in our Ears, and animating us to great and noble Actions; But if (as I say) we examine on th'o∣ther side, the frivolousnesse of the Thing, we shall find our selves impos'd by <HI>Antiquitie,</HI> and conclude with that <HI>Greek,</HI> who taken with the voice of the <HI>Nightingal,</HI> and imagining it
<PB N="110" REF="60"/>
some mighty thing, pluming it (for <HI>curiosity</HI>) and seeing what it was, cried out, <HI>Vox est, &amp; praeterea nihil,</HI> that 'twas a Voice, and nothing else. For first, if we consider the Fame of Writers, (in which the Fames of all others are included) both in its duration and Immensi∣tie, (for these two, forsooth, they promise you, shall never be terminate, and alwayes perma∣nent) if we consider, I say, unto how small a part and portion of the world their Fames can penetrate, how few understand their Lan∣guage, and how few of those who do, can read it, and lastly how few of those who can are curious; surely instead of painting it with wings, we might more properly paint it with <HI>Plumets</HI> at the heels, and in lieu of imagining it flying about the world, we may imagin it rather pent up, and fluttering about some nar∣row <HI>Bird-cage</HI> or <HI>volary</HI>: So as 'tis as great a folly and vanity to imagine what we write in our Language, or any other <HI>crudite Tongue</HI> whatsoever, can make any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar progresse in o∣ther Countries, as to imagine the sound of a Cymbal, or little Tinckling B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll could be heard over all the Universe. Then for the duration or perpetuating of it when I am dead, what a∣vails that me, or how can it more rejoyce and delight me, than Musick playd at my Tomb or Monument? When I am nam'd, who re∣members what I was? or when those are dead that knew me, who reflects upon my person hearing me mentioned; give me then Fame
<PB N="111" REF="60"/>
alive, and take whose list my Fame when I am dead, which at most, is but as the Eccho of dying voices, or the perfume of expiring Odours, rather shaddows than substances, and not so much as pictures, which terminate at least the imagination to certain <HI>species</HI> and Resemblances. And if any one object, By this opinion all Incitement to Ver∣tue and to noble and Heroick Actions is ta'n away; <HI>I</HI> absolutely deny it, and affirm that the Fame we enjoy alive, and our Countries and Families after our death, is sufficient in∣citement, and encouragement enough: so as to conclude, I must answer you, <HI>Madamoiselle,</HI> demanding what Fame is, as that Antient did him, who desir'd to know of him what <HI>God</HI> was, That he would tell him on the morrow; when summoned of his promise, he demanded two dayes respite more: and so went multi∣plying Time and delays, till being prest at last, he answered ingenuously, That <HI>before he thought of it he imagined he know it, but the more he thought of it, the lesse he knew of it</HI>; and here (<HI>Madamoiselle,</HI>) before I conclude, that the worshippers of this Fame may not think me Atheist, I have made this following Hymn, here to its honour, to acquit me of Im∣piety.</P>
<Q><L>Fame that from great &amp; noble Actions coms,</L>
<L>As pretious Odours from <HI>Arabian</HI> Gums,</L>
<L>The shadow that from brighter vertue flows,</L>
<L>And follows it along where ere it goes,</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="61"/>The Eccho of great names, the walking spright,</L>
<L>And Ghost of mighty men, the Tripartite</L>
<L>Division of us, when we'r dead and gon,</L>
<L>And nothing left of's here, but thee alone.</L>
<L>When Heaven our Soul has (where it never dies)</L>
<L>The Earth our Bodies, <HI>Fame</HI> our Memories;</L>
<L>Since only thou 'tis mak'st our memories last,</L>
<L>Nor can oblivion ever draw so fast</L>
<L>Her Curtain or't, as thou't undraw't agen,</L>
<L>To shew the fairer Portrait of 't to men.</L>
<L>To whom, fair daughter of Eternitie,</L>
<L>Should we commend our selves and works, but thee,</L>

<P>I Know not how you got the secret (but I'm sure you have it) to charm ill Tongues, and so stop the mouth of <HI>Mesdi sance,</HI> as whilst e∣very one (almost) speaks ill of others, every one speaks well of you; Is it because you speak ill of none? and give none occasion to speak ill of you? but they can doe it without occa∣sion, and when you give them none, can take it of themselves; or is your high <HI>Vertue</HI> above the reach of evil Tongues? but nothing in this Age is above their reach, who are so curious of finding fault, as where their eyes fail them, they invent new <HI>Prospectives,</HI> to find spots our even in the <HI>Sun</HI> it self; or is it lastly, a certain <HI>Majesty</HI> in your person, that daunts and aws them to Reverence?

<PB N="116" REF="63"/>
First <HI>Vice</HI> then I intend to call unto the barr, shall be <HI>Mocking, Ieering,</HI> and <HI>Derision,</HI> rather <HI>Abuses</HI> than <HI>Crimes,</HI> and next the more Criminous ones of <HI>Calumnie,</HI> and <HI>Detracti∣on.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Mocking, Ieering, and Derision.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Mocking, Ieering</HI> and <HI>Derision,</HI> may be de∣fin'd a malicious publishing of others Imper∣fections, with intent to render them ridiculous, (for if it be their Vices, 'tis <HI>Reproach</HI> and <HI>Con∣tumely,</HI> and done on purpose to render them odious,) and 'tis lawfull in no case, but only when Imperfections are affected, to laugh them out of them; whence 'tis good when us'd for <HI>Physick,</HI> but when only for <HI>poison,</HI> 'tis detesta∣ble. However, it becomes none but <HI>Buffoons,</HI> and under pain of becoming Ridiculous ones self, none is to endeavour to make others so. It tends to <HI>Enmitie,</HI> if it proceeds not thence; (for the faults of those we love, we seek to hide, and never seek to find fault with any, but those we care not for:) Mean time, whilst they imagin they shew their wits, they but shew their folly by't, and want of wit, none more foolishly purchasing Enemies, than they; it being as great a folly for a <HI>Iest</HI> to lose a Frend, as to sell ones <HI>Horse</HI> to buy him <HI>Pro∣vender.</HI> 'Tis a dangerous Vice too, being com∣monly the occasion of quarrel, (whilst it
<PB N="117" REF="63"/>
touches men where th'are most sensible) and therefore none but Women may safely use it; which is the cause (perhaps) why now adayes more <HI>women</HI> ar tainted with this vice than <HI>men.</HI> And if you mark it, their Mocking and Jeering at others, is principally for not being fine Gen∣tlemen, and <HI>a la mode</HI> (forsooth) they learning by looking on their <HI>Glasses,</HI> to looke on nothing but superficial things; (having more regard to the discomposure of ones <HI>Garments,</HI> than of their <HI>manners,</HI> and the disorder of their <HI>hair,</HI> than of their <HI>mind</HI>) and for such as these, your blunt man marrs their mirth, his not be∣ing put out of Countenance by't, putting them out of countenance themselves: Such an one was our Countrymen Sir <HI>Roger Williams,</HI> an excellent Souldier, but a blunt Courtier, who coming to Court after the losse of <HI>Sluce</HI> in <HI>Flandres,</HI> and being jeer'd for it by the La∣dies, with <HI>Is this he that deliver'd up Sluce?</HI> Pray let's see him, a <HI>doughty souldier no doubt he is.</HI>
<Q>Answered them <HI>brusquely,</HI> Yes Ladies, I am he; and on so good conditions, there is none of you▪ but would have deliver'd up your <HI>Sluces</HI> too.</Q> Nor did he spare <HI>Queen Elizabeth</HI> her self, when waiting long at Court to deliver a certain Petition for arrears of pay, and the <HI>Queen</HI> not willing to see him, he one day Encountring her where was no a∣voyding him, she, to put him out of counte∣nance, feign'd to smell some evil savour in the Room, crying nicely out, <HI>Fogh, What a stink's

here? Williams,</HI> I think it be your Boots (said she) that smell so. No by — said he, 'tis my Petition (<HI>Madam</HI>) I have kept it so long, e'r I could get it deliver'd. But to return to our subject. There are divers sorts of <HI>Deri∣sions</HI> and <HI>Mockery</HI>; Some by whisper, others more openly; some before ones face; others behind ones back; some finaly by laughing out-right, and others <HI>Ironically,</HI> and by dis∣sembled scorn: Of which, that of whisper is commonly the most offensive, which, whilst it takes away all place from Reply, leaves place to imagine the Injury greater than it is; whence, whilst the Affront perhaps regards but one, the Offence of it extends it self to all. Your publique way of Jeering is most dange∣rous, and your secret more base and cowardly; above all your <HI>Ironicall</HI> one does the least harm to those they mock, and the most to those who use it; it marring their Natures quite, and tea∣ching them falshood and dissembling. And generally those who are so diligent in marking others faults and Imperfections, must needs be full of Faults and Imperfections themselves; Since, whilst their minds are still abroad to ob∣serve others faults, they can never be at home to mark and amend their own. In fine, how∣ever light they make of it, they are to know, that no Generous spirit but can easilier brook Injury than Scorn, and the reparation of it too, is easier made: and that they but render themselves by it odious unto all, it being na∣tural
<PB N="119" REF="64"/>
for men to love those who esteem them, as tis to hate all those who disesteem them, (as those who mock and jeer them manifestly de∣clare they do.) To conclude, I could with them only to observe this rule, Never to say any thing of others, but what they would say be∣fore their faces, or what they would others should say of them behind their backs.</P>

<HEAD>XXXIX To the Lady, —</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How we are to contemn the Calumnies of the World.</HEAD>
<P>I Never knew any one nobly eminent in any kind but they were envyed and calumniated; It being the nature of base and low spirits, des∣pairing to arrive to that height, to which o∣thers by their merits and excellencies are at∣tain'd, to seek by detraction to pluck them down as low as they; nor will it be ever so happy with the world, to have more Emula∣tors than Envious: Emulation making men strive to be as good as others, but Envy to make others as bad as it, whence this vice is only found amongst the worser sort, to whom every one thats better than they seems to exprobate their being so ill; so as 'tis either some particular hate or self love that blinds them from seeing their own faults as well as those of other mens, else they would never calumniate others as they do, if they but considered, that one ought to be most cleer themselves of those faults they reproach to others, and he who cheaply sells others fame (upon th' accompt) makes but the Mar∣ket to buy his own. Mean while it being as impossible all should speak well, as that all
<PB N="125" REF="67"/>
should do well, and 'tis not what we are, but what they are that make them speak ill of us: we are to indeavour so to live, as our lives may give the lie to their reports, and that they may never say true any harm of us, and let them say false what they please, twill be more their own harm than ours.</P>
<P>To this purpose (Madam) I'll tell you a pleasant story, which I use often to recount, when I would laugh at these busie Censurers of others Actions. An <HI>Old man</HI> and his Son (a young stripling) travelling on the way, the <HI>Boy</HI> mounted on an <HI>Asse,</HI> the <HI>Father</HI> trud∣ging it on foot; The first Company they met began to revile the <HI>Boy,</HI> calling him ungra∣cious <HI>Rascal,</HI> was he not asham'd to ride, and let his <HI>Father</HI> walk on foot (nor must you i∣magine the charitable presage of hanging was forgot amongst them.) At this the <HI>Boy</HI> desired his <HI>Father</HI> to get up, and let him walk on foot; which being done, the next Company revil'd the <HI>Father</HI> as much as formerly tother had done the <HI>Son,</HI> calling him hard-hearted and cruel (strong and robustous as he was) to ride, and let the Tender Infant walk on foot; when the <HI>Father</HI> to content them took up his <HI>Son</HI> be∣hind him, and so they jogg'd on a while, till the next Company raild on them afresh, for over-burthening the poor <HI>Asse,</HI> calling them more Beasts than he (nor did the <HI>Asse</HI> ever know before how many friends he had a∣mongst the multitude) when to content these
<PB N="126" REF="68"/>
at last the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son</HI> both light and led the <HI>Asse,</HI> which when the next Company e∣spy'd, they laught at them more than the o∣thers had rail'd at them before, calling them a hundred fools, to tire and weary themselves, having an <HI>Asse</HI> to ride on: When the Good man perceiving the impossibility of conten∣ting the world, and avoiding its censure, wise∣ly resolv'd thereafter to content himself, and let them judge and censure him as they pleas'd.</P>
<P>And 'twas a wise resolution, I having found by experience, that one sooner stops <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he mouth of Calumnie by a resolute going on their way, than a too nice fear of irritating it, it being of the nature of Cowards, the more you fear it, the more outragious it becomes, and the vulgar like <HI>Apelles Coblar,</HI> but care for its censure once, and they will never leave censuring you; Mean time I know, as the <HI>Apostle</HI> says, that I am debtor in point of Fame both to the foolish and the wise, but if they wo'nt accept the payment, when tis lawfully tendered them, but find fault and cavill still; let them still remain unsatisfyed for me, and for that <HI>vae scandal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that <HI>woe to scandal,</HI> 'tis to be understood where <HI>scandal</HI> is given, not where 'tis taken before 'tis gi∣ven.</P>
<P>To conclude this point, never brave spirit yet, car'd what the Vulgar said, nor ever was brave nor noble Action perform'd by those
<PB N="127" REF="68"/>
that did. Insomuch as <HI>Alcibiades</HI> would ad∣minister them matter himself to censure him. <HI>Alexander</HI> gloried in it affirming nothing was more great, nor <HI>Kingly,</HI> than to do well, and hear ill for it; and <HI>Aristides</HI> was so offended at the peoples speaking well of him, as he askt his Friends, not without Indignation, What ill he had done that he should deserve it at their hands.</P>
<P>But what should we goe so far for Examples, when we have others nearer home, I remem∣bring to have heard of the late Earl of <HI>Exce∣ter,</HI> how (amongst his many other Excellent Apothegms) he demanded one day of his La∣dy, Whether none spoke ill of him? and she assuring him they were so far from it, as (on the contrary) every one spoke well of him; <HI>Mary,</HI> and <HI>I am sorry for it,</HI> said he, for <HI>'tis a sign I have nothing of extraordinary,</HI> they <HI>being most commonly your</HI> ordinariest persons of <HI>whom the world speaks</HI> well, with the slight commendations of <HI>Oh he is a good man! An honest man</HI>! &amp;c.

<PB N="128" REF="69"/>
to such a height of uncharity to con∣demn the Intentision, when we cann't the Act, at least, calling Devotion, Hypocri∣sie; Honest Liberty, Dissolutenesse; Com∣placency, Flattery; nor is there any Action so Good, they cannot sind a bad name for; nor intail upon't an ill intention, insomuch as one was so injurious to his Mistris Beauty not long since to say,
<Q><L>"Cease jealous Thoughts, and thus resolve at last,</L>
<L>"She has more Beautie than becomes the Chast,</L></Q>
Worthy of no Mistris, but such an ugly one as none should Love but he, who would intitle Deformity, rather then Beauty to vertue, a∣gainst the intention of Nature, with whom it implies a certain fitnesse to conserve choicest Iewells in the fairest Cabinets, and to lodge the noblest persons in the stateliest Palaces; Yet such is the Iniquity of the Times, as Beauty only, because 'tis Beautiful, is calumniated now, as Vertue, because 'tis out of fashion: And this Madam is just your case, whose excessive Beautie makes you not onely the mark of Envious Eyes, but also of malicious Tongues, to spit their venome at, whilst de∣fended by your Innocence, their poyson, like the Cockatrices, but returns upon themselves. Mean time thank your beauty (<HI>Madam</HI>) or rather he who gave it you, for delivering you by it from the many vices of your detractors,
<PB N="129" REF="69"/>
you having too many perfections to envy the praise of them in others, or to calumniate that in them, which is so praise worthy in your self, whilst you need not vex Nature nor your self, as they do, to become fairer than you are. To whom (or rather to the Truth in∣deed) I must give this Testimony, that ha∣ving as a Spy of all that's fair and good, tra∣vail'd almost o'r all the world, I never met with greater Beauty accompanied with grea∣ter Innocence, nor one who thought lesse harm, because she did none, nor judg'd lesse ill of others, because she knew none in her self, and of this your chearfulnesse and free∣dom of behaviour is to me sufficient Argu∣ment; Those who dissemble most common∣ly over-doing, whilst they are over-anxious to do enough; whilst who are secretly im∣modest, cloath it in an outward demurenesse, and feign'd modesty, which most commonly, like Gold gilt, shews fairer than Gold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it¦self.</P>
<P>If any fault then there be, tis in the Time it¦self, which though it can never warrant bad Actions, can render Indifferent warrantable at least, and so I see no reason but our behavi∣our, as our fashons, may alter with the times, and become more large or strait, as the fashons are. To conclude this point, what is affected is deform'd. as what is naturall is ever beco∣ming as 'tis (Madam) in you to be cheerfully free, and in a word, your self▪ In which I wish
<PB N="130" REF="70"/>
none to imitate you, if they be not of your dis∣position, nor you to alter, unlesse you be of theirs.</P>
<P>Be still then your self (Madam) in spight of your Detractors; that is, one of the fairest and beautifullest creatures in the world, and let none make you lesse Good, by calumnia∣ting your Goodnesse as they do; And in con∣lusion assure your self, that as you shall never want Detractors of the baser sort: (as are all such who detract from you) So of the better and nobler you shall never want Admirers and Honoures: amongst the rest (Madam) I hope more than one Age, as more than one Nati∣on shall testifie how much I am your Faithfull Honourer and Admirer.</P>

<P>FRendship being our second Religion, and so main a part of our first, I have design'd to present it so beautiful to the Eye, as all should be ravisht wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h its Love and Admirati∣on. To this end I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>personated it in the loveliest sex, and that betwixt persons of the same sex too, for avoiding all suspect; <HI>Frend∣ship being nothing but Love stript of suspi∣tion of Harm.</HI> For representing it by Ladies, after the like example of the Queen and her Ladies here formerly, &amp; of the greatest Ladies &amp; P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>incesses in <HI>Spain, France Flandres,</HI> and else where, I thought none reasonably could take exceptions, nor think me too ambitious in'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, e∣specially I having been long Time train'd up &amp; conversant in the Courts of the greatest Queens and Princesses in <HI>Europe,</HI> and consequently not altogether ignorant of personating and pre∣senting them according to their dignity and quality.</P>
<P>First then for <HI>Blondinia</HI> and <HI>Lindiana,</HI> I make them vindicating to their Fair Sex, all the Noblenesse &amp; Generosity as ever was in man,
<PB N="148" REF="79"/>
and to their Friendship all the dearnesse and tendernesse as ever was in Love.</P>
<P>For the two Princesses <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artiana</HI> and <HI>Philo∣thea,</HI> I make them of equal perfection, though of different disposition (like <HI>Pamela</HI> and <HI>Phi∣loclea</HI> in the <HI>Arcadia</HI>) high minded, magnani∣mous, excelling in all the Vertues of great Princes, and not to make them more than Princes, subject too to their noble Vices of Anger, Ambition, &amp;c, To shew in fine that they are not vertuous by chance, but by choice and Election, since they may be otherwise.</P>
<P>For <HI>Bellara,</HI> she is a person whose divine Conversation would even make you doubt whe'r she were humain or no. Her wisdom is so great as there is no Labyrinth in this world she would not help you out of, by conecting a Thrid of first and second causes together. She has charge both of the Altar and Oracle, yet is her breast the purest Altar, and mouth the truest Oracle: so as in following her opinion, you are sure of Truth for guide, and in follow∣ing her Example you are sure of Heaven for Frend.</P>
<P>For <HI>Euphemia,</HI> so young yet as she is but a <HI>Neophi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and under <HI>Bellaras</HI> tuition, she is of so pure a brest, as like white paper she is ap∣ted for receiving all the others divine Precepts and Impressions: so as you may well guesse at what she will be hereafter, by what the other is at present.</P>
<P>For <HI>Compase</HI> lastly, and the rest, we may
<PB N="149" REF="79"/>
well say of them, that as those who play the Fools part in the Play, are most commonly the wisest men: so those are most commonly the best <HI>Actors,</HI> who play those Treacherous parts, and though they be not lookt on with such gracious Eyes for the persons they represent; yet certainly they are most Admir'd, when they represent them well, as Painters when they paint some ugly Body to the life.</P>
<P>For the Plot, to give you some light of it, I feign a Commonwealth of Amazon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and (to render it more propable than tother) of peace∣full ones, sent there in Colony, though for the greater variety distemper'd into Warr; In which (<HI>Heroina's</HI> as they are) you are not to wonder, to see them do Actions of greatest <HI>Heroes,</HI> and capable of all the Heroical Ex∣ploits you admire of men in Story. I ha∣ving found in your noble Sex a capacity of all the Excellency I ever yet found in man.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF those on whose soyl the Tree grows have most right to the fruit, none has more right than your self to this following <HI>Ode</HI> in praise of the Country life, since 'twas made at <HI>Grewel</HI> with you in the Country. After which I know not what excuse to allege for my living in the Town, but that self-accusing one of <HI>Phe∣dra, Video meliora, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j rasequor,</HI> or this, that when I would live to my <HI>friends</HI> and <HI>self, I</HI> go into the <HI>Country,</HI> when to others, I goe to <HI>Town</HI>; However, I being of that <HI>Amphibean</HI> Gender, with those who are now in one, now in tother, do receive this benefit (at least) by it, that the one but begets an appetite to tother; all pleasures in this life consisting in a certain change, and vicissitude, which indeed is but a pause and respite of pain, or relaxation from misery (none taking pleasure in rest, but the weary, nor in eating but the hungry, &amp;c.) which you'll easily perceive, when continue them but too long, and you make a pain of that pleasure, and begin to long for the plea∣sure of the pain you had before; such is our humane infirmity, as like sick men in their beds,
<PB N="168" REF="89"/>
we lye tossing and tumbling up and down, and restlesly change place, only to find rest, which we can never find, because we carry unrest a∣long with us, <HI>quod è re nascitur vix evitatur</HI>; the purest company which I find without lassi∣tude is the company and conversation of a frend, which is the more pure the more spiritual they are; and that, Sir, I never enjoy in grea∣ter perfection, than when I am with your com∣pany.</P>
