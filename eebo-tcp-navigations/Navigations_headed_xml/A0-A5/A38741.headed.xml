<P>WHen the whole World stands amazed, suspecting its own <HI>Fate;</HI> and most of the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> are a <HI>Rid∣dle</HI> to themselves: When the <HI>wiser</HI> sort of Man∣kind discourse Events, and the <HI>rest dread</HI> them: When Men apprehend Things by piece-meals, and discourse Business by parcells; A clear, compleat, and impartial State of Af∣fairs (such as this, representing all <HI>Europe</HI> in one entire View) must needs be as Ʋseful in the Perusal, as it was Plausible in the Ʋn∣dertaking: Especially since,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> It contains such Discourses, as were not the Author's Reading, but his Observation of Things that happened, not only since he <HI>re∣membred,</HI> but since he <HI>observed</HI> too.</P>
<PB REF="4"/>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> It's not only <HI>Lumen Siccum,</HI> I mean such an Account of Things, as is not steeped, in either Humour, or Interest.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> It's not only a Superficial Relation of Affairs, but a deep and solid Inquisition into their Grounds and Bottomes: Not a short Gazet of <HI>1665.</HI> but prudent Reflections on the State of most Kingdomes, since the Peace at <HI>Munster, 1648.</HI></P>
<P>With what Content the Politician here may observe the Interests and Pretensions of <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI> With what Satisfaction the Curious may here discern the Fate of Empires; With what Pleasure the Gentleman notes here the Suc∣cessions, Alliances, and Relations of <HI>Christ∣endom;</HI> With what Gust the Novelist gains here the Ground and Reason of most Ʋnderta∣kings, Transactions, Successes, and Miscar∣riages; With what Delight the Retired Man looks, in one View, on the several Aspects of each Kingdom one towards the other, and expects in silence the issues of Grand Counsels
<PB REF="4"/>and Revolutions; looking wisely into the dark, but pleasing Prospect of Futurity, upon the Concerns of late Posterity, Is not so easily ex∣pressed, as experienced; it being the issue of calm Reason in large Breasts, that are not content to <HI>Inhabit</HI> the World only, but to <HI>Understand</HI> it too.</P>
<P>To see the Grandeur and Glory of <HI>France,</HI> the Decaying and Infirmities of <HI>Spain,</HI> the fa∣tal Resolutions of <HI>Holland,</HI> the uncertain For∣tune of the Empire; the Troubles and Disorders of <HI>Poland;</HI> the Settlement and Strength of <HI>England, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> the general Design of <HI>Europe</HI> for Free-Trade; the old Claims, Pretensions, and Titles of States and Kingdomes; the Riches, Power, Sea, &amp; Land-Forces, and Policies of each Government; the Failures, Over-sights, Errours, and Defects of most Potentates; the Plots, Designs, and In∣clinations of each Common-wealth; the Situa∣tions, Dependencies, Respects, and Confedera∣cies of most Nations, in one entire Prospect, is

<PB REF="6"/>such a Satisfaction to inquisitive and reason∣ing Spirits, as may excuse this publication of a Posthumous work, whereof the Author saw two third Parts printed; especially since, that next to Authors and Composers of Books, their Con∣servators and Guardians deserve most Thanks and Commendations. We think we owe a great deal to such as <HI>Photius</HI> and <HI>Stobeus</HI> (and the publick-spirited <HI>Sirmondus,</HI> of the late Times) through the industry of whom, we do enjoy many things, which but for them we might have lost. How comes it to pass, that we have nothing, (unless meer Fragments, and arrant Scraps) of such as <HI>Berosus, Citesius, Megastenes, Theo∣pompus, Eughorus, Callisthenes,</HI> and <HI>Timuus?</HI> Or that we want so many Books of <HI>Diodorus Siculus, Polybius, Livius,</HI> and <HI>Dion Cassius?</HI> But because there were not, in all Times, Men of faithful, industrious, and publick Souls, that looked on themselves as Citizens of the World, and could not enjoy a thought of their own, but what they made (as we do these Discourses) common to Mankind.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Europae Modernae Speculum:</HI> OR, A VIEW <HI>OF THE</HI> Empires, Kingdoms, Prin∣cipalities, Seigneuries, <HI>and</HI> Common-Wealths <HI>OF</HI> Europe, In their Present State; <HI>WITH</HI> Their Distinct Interests, Policies and Concerns.</HEAD>
<P>THere was once but one uniform, simple and genuine Reason, the sure Guide, and uner∣ring Rule of all humane Counsels, until the depra∣vity of <HI>Mans</HI> Nature, by its Luciferian Arrogance, would needs exalt Sense above her, and <HI>sought out many devices</HI> to accomplish it. One of the chief
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>Projections hereto was the deriving and slucing out that comprehensive and capacious receptacle, the <HI>conservation of the publick good,</HI> lodged in the depths of wisdom, into manifold branches, and oblique narrow windings and Maeanders of pri∣vate advantages, which so drained and exhausted that first Bed and copious source of all those bles∣sings which the first Age of the World enjoyed, that it is now become a meer shallow conception, and like the Springs of the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> more in Notion and Speculation, than of any certain Exist∣ence.</P>
<P>And this hath been the labour and industry of all Persons in all ages, the Populacy, and the Vul∣gar as guilty of the Innovation as those Potentates whom they implead of a most injurious Usurpation of their right: all times concurring in their suffrage against this first Law, seeking nothing else in the changes and vicissitudes of so many Governments, but their temporary ease, and some particular Emoluments to themselves, although they have vainly pretended, that those their restless Agitati∣ons, and irregular confused wayes to the pertur∣bation of the publique, were nothing else but na∣tural tendencies, how violent soever to that common Center, the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Whole.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That Prin∣ciple of Common Good how iluded.</NOTE>By which means it hath come to pass, that the World hath put on another dress, and hath been disguised in various shapes of Policies, such as would best sute the Humour and Genius of Peo∣ple, without consulting that first and perpetual Principle, which in this crazy declension of all things, must needs be supposed to abate and lose
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>of its vigour; And to help out this Position, Men have invented an Artifice, by placing such and such Nations under such &amp; such Climes &amp; Temperatures, which either do so rarefact and attenuate it in some sharper and serener Aires of <HI>Europe,</HI> that it is as good as lost, or else condensate it in some thicker and grosser Regions, that it is as difficult to be found.</P>
<P>And under these, or the like Capricies, are the <HI>Europeans</HI> rendred obnoxious to one another, by natural Antipathies framed to keep them in mutual abhorrence, (as if wise Nature, when she framed but one Man in the beginning, out of whose Loyns all Nations should proceed, had composed him to their very purpose of inconsistent and unso∣ciable Qualities and Materials) which hath been fomented also by two of the most powerful Passi∣ons, Jealousie and Ambition, the Effects where∣of, in sundry National Quarrells, have almost ex∣tinguished both the Combatants. But Jealousie is the uncurable Disease, which hath made <HI>Christ∣endom</HI> to languish under a tedious and wasting Consumption, in spite of all cure and remedy, even of the peaceful and saving Gospel, by the ineffectual operation whereof, we are not only like to become a Prey, but are already the scorn and reproach of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Infidels.</HI></P>
<P>Me thinks I hear that of <HI>Lucan,</HI> in his elegant flattery to <HI>Nero,</HI> given as true counsel and advice in the Courts of some Princes and States,</P>
<Q><L>— Librati pondera Coeli</L>
<L>Orbe tene medio. —</L></Q>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<P>To get so high, that they may govern and ballance the World, and overlook the Affairs of the Uni∣verse; which Elevation to so ticklish a point of Grandeur and Felicity, as it hath been fancied by some, is so incapable of persistency, that the Fate of <HI>Phaeton</HI> hath attended their ambitious De∣signs, and cast their Dominions into Flame and Combustion.</P>
<P>Not to deny, but that a just Temperature of a formidable power and greatness, ought to be nice∣ly regarded, when the vicinity of so many united Dominions and Soveraignties unequally distribu∣ted, may give suspicion of Encroachment; but when such Discourses are like the story of 88. an∣tiquated, and very unpracticable; and the very Umbrages of those things disappear, and are vani∣shed, for that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, and the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> (whose great accessions of Territory gave rise to those Observations on which the Policy of the last Age was founded) are con∣cluded to be consumptive, and to stand meerly on the defensive part; the present divisions of <HI>Europe</HI> in this unhappy Juncture cannot be palliated or co∣vered with this fig-leaf.</P>
<P>As, if the Toss of Ambition be in the other Bucket, which in counterpoize of the formers as∣piring glories, hath strugled through a War of al∣most a 100. years duration, but hath now inter∣changed Aimes and Designes by Conversion, in∣tending the self-same advantages of a Purse and Puissance; the said Differences are more enviously calamitous, and are so far from Colour of Excuse, that they give the World to see, that they do not
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>act by the Rule of what they ought, but what they may or can do; and that the longest Sword hath no measure but its Scabbard, to which once drawn, it seldom returns. Such as these may be the occult cause of our Differences, (not imputing it to the present War between the <HI>Muscovite</HI> and the <HI>Pole,</HI> which is an Haereditary and National Quarrell a∣bout the Lands of their Dominions, conterminate and confining upon one another; or to some small mis-understandings in <HI>Germany,</HI> not considerable but for this Juncture, of both which we shall treat in its place more amply) but there is a kind of Evil, which hath attended every grand and happy Revolution in <HI>Christendom,</HI> that is assignable as the principal and general Motion to these present Troubles.</P>
<P>Fortune was never yet so respectful and offici∣ously kind, but that her Train was very chargeable; nor doth she in her greatest Indulgence but fae∣nerate and commute her Favours. The late ge∣neral Peace was not given <HI>Gratis,</HI> nor those <HI>Pal∣ladian</HI> Semblances of Accommodation, without armed force in the womb of those concealed De∣signes which yet amuse <HI>Christendom;</HI> and it is most true, that the Pope his Holiness, who, in the beginning of his Papacy, laid about him so much for the Reconciliation of the two Crowns, was not over-pleased when he saw it was finished, and yet not out of any pique with the Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> (who attributed to himself the glory of the Affair, by timing it to his own Notes) as hath been suppo∣sed, but because he prudently foresaw that the over-grown power of that King would be dan∣gerous
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>to the Ecclesiastical State.</P>
<P>So that Peace and War are like Generation and Corruption, they follow one another, naturally and commonly the greater the pacification is, and the more things seem to be stilled and composed, the more vehement and violent the rupture; for War is like an Earthquake, presaged by a serene Sky, and a quiet, gentle Air, sooner than by any other prognostick or sign whatsoever. And so much less sufficient is the state of <HI>Christendom</HI> to provide against the suddenness of such a calamity, for that the scale of Politiques, as was hinted be∣fore, is quite altered, and of a different and vari∣ous administration, the power being circulated to another Corner, and with the Wind may blow where it list, while the Eastern Torrent or Inunda∣tion carries all before it.</P>
<P>Having thus glanced at these Causes which have embroyled <HI>Europe,</HI> we come now to the Effects in the description and account thereof for the plain and perfect Elucidation of the premises; and first we consider <HI>Europe</HI> in General, where we content our selves with the survey of its Extent and Defini∣tion.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of <HI>Europe</HI> in General.</HEAD>
<P>IT is reputed one and the chief Quarters of the World, though far less than any of the other three; whom it as far exceedeth in Magnificence, Nobleness, Number of People, Armes, Arts, Prudence and Prowess, and the result of all these,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>Fame and Renown. It is bounded on the North with the North Ocean, or <HI>Deucalidon</HI> Sea, on the South with the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> on the East with the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> and a Line drawn from thence to the <HI>Scythian</HI> or Frozen Sea (which hath been un∣known to our modern Geographers, who suppo∣sed the <HI>Tanais</HI> to be of a longer and further derived Current than in truth it is) and on the West with the Western or <HI>American</HI> Seas. It containeth 28. Kingdoms, reckoning those petty Royalties of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Hereditary Dominions of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Principal Provinces are, <HI>Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Slavonia, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Lituania, Moscovia,</HI> and that large Ter∣ritory towards the North, called <HI>Scandia,</HI> being its general name, but divided into the Kingdoms of <HI>Norway, Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> with their Pro∣vinces of <HI>Jutland, Finland, Lapland,</HI> &amp;c. The Islands are <HI>Great Brittain</HI> (containing the King∣doms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI>) <HI>Ireland;</HI> and <HI>Ze∣land, Holland, Engroveland</HI> in the Northern Oce∣an. In the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> are <HI>Sicily Candy, Corsi∣ca, Sardinia, Majorca, Minorica, Nicropont, Malta, Corfu,</HI> and many other in the <HI>Archipela∣go.</HI> The Air is excellently good, wholesom and Temperate, and the Soyl Fertile; which qualities appear in the Constitution and good Temper of the Natives, by which they have excelled all other Nations, in Courage, Arts, sharpness of Wit, and all other Gifts of Nature; to the perfection whereof it is stored with many famous and learned Universities, the peculiar Dignity and Advantage
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>of this quarter of the World. In former and more antient times it commanded <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africk,</HI> un∣der the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Empires; the last ob∣scured in the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and the other as much if not more renowned in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Fami∣ly, whose present Armes are the Terrour of the Whole. It is also solely famous for Navigation, and the great acquisitions made thereby upon vaster Regions of the unknown World. So that it may be reckoned the Mother of one of the biggest and lar∣gest quarters of the Universe, to wit, <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus briefly described the whole, we come to a particular view of the distinct Regions, their Site, Advantages, Government and present Interest; and that we may take the Round the more commodiously for the purpose of this Dis∣course, we will begin with the retrograde course, from North to the Westward, and so Eastward, the <HI>Point</HI> and main Entendment of this Perambula∣tion, and in order thereunto begin with <HI>Poland,</HI> though lying Eastward also, but now faced to the Northward, and hath wholly unconcerned it self in the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and so of less moment to this Treatise, which directs chiefly to that sole Affair.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>POLAND.</HEAD>
<P><HI>POLAND</HI> is bounded on the East with <HI>Mus∣covia,</HI> and <HI>Tartaria,</HI> and part of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> on the South with <HI>Hungary,</HI> on the West with <HI>Germany,</HI> and on the North with the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea.
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>The Air is most extraordinarily pure, and the Soyl so excellent, that it is almost impossible to suppose the quantity of Corn which is hence transported into foreign Countries. It is a champian plain Country, interlaced with Lakes and Rivers, and beautified with many little Woods, but this Cha∣racter chiefly respects the Greater <HI>Poland,</HI> which lies between <HI>Dantzick</HI> and <HI>Cracovia,</HI> and all <HI>Litua∣nia,</HI> wherein notwithstanding are very massy Woods. The Lesser <HI>Poland,</HI> which contains the rest, even to the Frontiers of <HI>Hungary,</HI> is not less fruitful, although it be not so uniform, where it is divided from <HI>Prussia</HI> with little Hills, rather than Mountains. In it are many Mines of Salt and Sil∣ver, with Wines, infinite quantities of Honey and Wax found in their VVoods, and other excellent Fruits. The Air hereof is so temperate, that it is commonly called, the Entrance of <HI>Italy,</HI> that is to say, the Gate and Portal of all Delights and Plea∣sures imaginable. It containeth, as its now in Circuit, 120. <HI>German</HI> Miles, from the utter∣most bounds of <HI>Livonia,</HI> or <HI>Liefland,</HI> to the bor∣ders of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and from the borders of <HI>Silesia,</HI> East and VVest to <HI>Muscovia</HI> as many. It compre∣hends many goodly and large Provinces, as the two <HI>Polands, Massovia, Podolia, Prussia, Russia-Nigra, Volinia, Livonia,</HI> and <HI>Lituania. Poland</HI> was the Proper Seat of the <HI>Polonians,</HI> but <HI>Prussia,</HI> part of <HI>Pomerania, Podolia, Volinia, Massovia,</HI> and <HI>Livonia,</HI> were gained by Armes; <HI>Lithuania,</HI> and <HI>Symogythia,</HI> once Provinces of <HI>Russia,</HI> were the Inheritance of the House of <HI>Jagello,</HI> who in the year 1380. taking to VVife the Princess <HI>Hed∣wiga,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>the youngest Daughter of <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Po∣land</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> was in her right, upon his Conversion to Christianity, accepted for King of <HI>Poland;</HI> since which time, that Dutchy hath been united to the Crown; the last Heir of this Family was <HI>Sigismond Augustus,</HI> after whose de∣cease, the <HI>Lithuanians</HI> dreading the power of the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> agreed to the way of Election of a King, with the other Provinces of the Kingdom. As to <HI>Prussia,</HI> the other great Limb of this King∣dom, it did belong to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Knights, their great Master residing herein, who being weakned by many combats, at last yielded himself Feudato∣ry to King <HI>Casimir;</HI> Since which time, <HI>Albert</HI> of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> their great Master, becoming a Protestant, changed his Title, and was created Duke of <HI>Prussia</HI> by King <HI>Sigismond,</HI> and the Coun∣try divided into two parts, the one Regal, im∣mediately holden of the Crown, and the other Ducal. In the former stand <HI>Marienburg, Thorn, Elbing, Culma, Varnia,</HI> and <HI>Dantzick,</HI> enjoy∣ing the Priviledge and Title of the second <HI>Hanse</HI> Town. In the latter, the chiefest place is <HI>Co∣nincksburg,</HI> a Port of traffique, where the Duke sometime keepeth his Court. As to <HI>Livonia,</HI> it came to be reckoned into the <HI>Poles</HI> Dominions on this manner; in the year 1558. these People be∣ing spoyled of the greatest part of their Territory by the great Duke of <HI>Muscovia,</HI> and the great Ma∣ster of the Order no longer able to maintain them; nor his own Dominions therein (the Country be∣ing wholly his) submitted to <HI>Sigismond</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who took them into his protection, and
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>maintained them under it, maugre all the force of the <HI>Russians.</HI> At present there is a third Proprie∣tor, namely the <HI>Swede,</HI> who hath a good, and the chiefest part in it, being possessed of <HI>Riga,</HI> the principal City of trade (with many other con∣siderable places, as <HI>Revel, Narve, Pernow,</HI> &amp;c.) which was besieged in 1658. by the <HI>Russian</HI> Em∣perour in person, when the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was engaged in <HI>Denmark;</HI> but as the Town was brought to extremity, some dismay or despair seized the unwitting Assailants, and made them abandon a very hopeful Enterprize. The Town is now bet∣ter fortified and provided, and dreads not the pow∣er of the <HI>Pole</HI> or <HI>Muscovite.</HI> This Province, as also <HI>Prussia,</HI> for the nearness of the Sea, Con∣course to the Havens (many of them of good worth) and commodiousness of the Rivers, hath fairer Cities, goodlier Buildings, and by traffique greater plenty of Riches than any of the rest; but <HI>Poland</HI> is better and more generally peopled. <HI>Sa∣mogythia</HI> being a more Northern Country, is more rude and barbarous than any of them; and <HI>Podolia</HI> more barren; the fault whereof is not in the soyl, reported by Dr. <HI>Heylins</HI> Author to be miraculously fertile, but in the barbarous and unmerciful depo∣pulations of the <HI>Tartars</HI> every year commonly, but of late it hath pretty well recovered it self.</P>
<P>Having thus discoursed of the Provinces, it will be requisite to describe in brief manner some of the principal Cities thereof, which do concern this discourse. <HI>Dantzick</HI> is the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dantzick <HI>Described.</HI></NOTE> seated upon the <HI>Weysel,</HI> and accosting the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea.

It is as well and as proudly built as most of the Ci∣ties of <HI>Germany,</HI> but beyond all in <HI>Poland,</HI> and as regularly fortified.

<PB N="13" REF="14"/>the Palace, the Castle, and the Royal Garden; the two chief Churches are the Jesuites, named St. <HI>John,</HI> and St. <HI>Mark.</HI> 4. <HI>Cracovia</HI> in Lesser <HI>Poland,</HI> once the Court of the Kings of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> a wealthy and well-peopled City, sited like∣wise upon the <HI>Weysel.</HI> In it is remarkable an Aca∣demy of great Renown, founded by King <HI>Casimir</HI> the First, and supplyed at first with Professors from the Sorbonne of <HI>Paris.</HI> 2. The Castle, built up∣on the banks of the River, of a great compass, and of great state and magnificence, although outward∣ly it appear rough and disproportioned; the Cathe∣dral is enclosed within it. This City, by way of Excellence, is called, the <HI>Rome</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> and its University, the Daughter of that at <HI>Paris,</HI> The City of <HI>Casimir</HI> is built on the other side the water, and will hardly forget the <HI>Swedish</HI> Arms.

<P>As to the <HI>People,</HI> and their <HI>Manners,</HI> the Gen∣tlemen are extraordinary large and strong of body, and will skilfully manage a Shabel or Scymiter, are well skill'd in foreign Languages, are liberal Gi∣vers, good Cavaliers, and good Catholiques. On
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>the contrary, and the reverse of the Medal, they are much brutal, superstitious, fierce and proud, and sacrifice to their own approbation of things, and acknowledge no Soverain but their Liberty. From whence have proceeded those Mischiefs which they have often suffered, more mediately from the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Muscovites;</HI> and by which means the late King of <HI>Sweden</HI> brought them to the utmost degree of Extremity, followed with no more than 40. thousand men, when as the <HI>Pole</HI> is able to bring a 100000. Horse into the Field. This happened by that small power and authority which is allowed the King, and that little good in∣telligence that was maintained between their Ge∣neralls, and the divisions and revolts of their Troops. An Apprentice, a Novice, will be thought a Master; and a simple Gentleman, who never saw a Battel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Polands</HI> Chiefest Praeroga∣tive.</NOTE> but in picture, will not want of confidence and presumption to believe of him self, because he is born a Gentleman, that he is able, at the first Essay, to manage and conduct the Forces of an Empire. And in effect, private Gen∣tlemen are so frequently raised to Places of the greatest Office and Command, (which is the fairest flower of this Kings Prerogative, and is legally vest∣ed in him as the Fountain of Honour) that every man thinks himself of merit and capacity enough for the greatest Employments. Besides, they hold themselves all equal in blood, and have the same Voices in their Diets and Assemblies, the same Priviledges, Rights, and Franchises; their Riches only distinguish them one from the other.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen, for the defence of the King∣dom,
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>are bound to serve at their own charge, which they do generally on Horseback, gallantly furnished and attired in Cassocks, and garnished with gold and silver, and variety of other Colours; they also adorn themselves with Eagles Plumes, the Skins of Leopards and Bears, with many Banners, and parti-coloured Ensignes, which distinguish them from the ordinary sort, and strike terrour (but sometimes covetous desires) into their Ene∣mies; and most an end they carry, like the Philo∣sopher, all they have about them. It is reckoned that <HI>Poland</HI> after this manner can raise a 100. <HI>Li∣thuania</HI> 70. thousand Horse, but not so good as the <HI>Poles;</HI> whose best are very small, yet nimble, and far more couragious than the <HI>Dutch.</HI> In this Cavalry, consisting of Gentlemen, and their Ser∣vants, with their Auxiliaries, as the <HI>Circassion,</HI> the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> they are so confident, that they slight all Fortifications, unless Frontiers: And for the Country being all Champian, is most and only fit for that service; the Foot they have are borrowed of the <HI>Hungarians</HI> and <HI>Germans;</HI> and for Camp Drud∣gery, as Pioneers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they use <HI>Tartars</HI> their Slaves. Of Priests there is great store in this Coun∣try, and they held in good esteem and veneration. Of Merchants there are very few, scarce worth mentioning: But of all men, the Boors and Pe∣sants are the most miserable, for they possess nor enjoy a Farthing; and are meer Vassalls to their Lords, which treat and use them with all the rigour and tyranny in the world. A Gentleman in a slight matter, among his Domestiques and Clowns, hath and doth exercise the power of life and death.</P>

<P>The <HI>Government</HI> representeth rather an Aristo∣cracy than a Monarchy, and is a kind of <HI>medium</HI> be∣twixt both, or both together. It is Monarchical, in that it acknowledges one Supremacy and King: it is Aristocratical, because the King is not an ab∣solute Prince, to do what he pleaseth; and because the Nobility, who have also the greatest Authori∣ty in the Diets, do Elect Him. They have nei∣ther Law, nor Statute, nor Form of Government written, but it is all by Tradition; as by meer Cu∣stom, from the Death of one Prince to the Electi∣on of another, the supreme Authority resides in the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Gesne,</HI> who is alwayes Presi∣dent of the Council, appointeth the Diet, ruleth the Senate, and proclaimeth the new Elected King. Before King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s time, who erected new Bishops, Palatines, and Castellanes in <HI>Livonia,</HI> there were but 14. Bishops, 28. Palatines, and 70. of the chiefest Castellanes, that had Voices in the Election of a King, who is</P>
<Q><L>Rector Senatus sed Regnantis.</L>
<L>Ruler of a raigning Senate.</L></Q>
<P>Whereby he is obliged to comport with them in these things following; In any Affair of Impor∣tance, the King by his Chancellour sends Letters to the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and Palatines, which are called <HI>Instruction is Literae,</HI> Letters of Instruction, because they contain the account of that Business which His Majesty will propose to them at the Diet, and therein appoints them the time of their meeting. These Letters being re∣ceived,
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>every Senator examines the particular qua∣lity, nature and consequences of the Proposition, to which he hath free liberty to answer negatively or affirmatively, and as he judgeth best, either for the publick good, or his particular advantage. The King also sends his Letters to the respective Palati∣nates, the Nobility whereof presently assemble together, to chuse a Nuncio, as they call it; that is, a Person of merit and sufficiency, to be their Speaker; and the manner of that Palatinate, is to bring things to an universal consent and accommo∣dation: For if it should happen, that any single Gentleman should dissent from what this As∣sembly hath concluded, there is no further pro∣ceeding to be had, the Nuncio must not depart to the Diet, nor that Province have any Voice or In∣terest amongst the States General.</P>
<P>When the Provincial Assemblies are finished, by the time appointed by the Kings Majesty; the Se∣nators, and the Nuncio's come to Court; where the King, attended by the Chancellor, having a∣gain declared to them the Subject, and the Cause, for which he summoned them, receives and hears their advice, and so the Affairs are ended; <HI>Ne∣mine contradicente, nemine dissentiente:</HI> Other∣wise, the Diet is dissolved, every one departs, and the Proposalls, so far advanced, return again to their Idaeas. The ordinary Matters are decided by those Judges that are established in every Pro∣vince.</P>
<P>It is reported, that all sorts of Persons are ad∣mitted to enter, and to hear that which is proposed in the Provincial Assemblies, but not in the Gene∣ral
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>ones; so that the meanest Pesant may divulge that which ought not to pass the Cabinet of the Prince. If they treat of War, the Enemy having news of it, stands upon his Guard, and oftentimes prevents that, whfch, after long debate, is con∣cluded for the Conduct of their Troops. Every man knows how many men shall make the Vant∣guard, or the Reserves: what Provisions, Advan∣tages or Dis-advantages; and in fine, every thing relating to the menage of the War. When this is considered, and these Maximes of State examined, with the slowness and the difficulty of concluding any thing, together with the bounded power of the King, and the licence, and caprices, and ig∣norance of the Subject, as to a particular Person, whose <HI>No</HI> spoils all: And lastly, those Engines which move this Empire; it may be assuredly affirm∣ed; that the Policy thereof cannot be much advan∣tagious to the Publique; and that the Being thereof depends more upon the Valour, than the Prudence of the <HI>Poles;</HI> unless in Matters meerly Military, and in Action, and in the General's Disposal; And that the Allies of this Crown shall never receive a∣ny advantage or succour from it, for that this way of Government was solely invented for the subsist∣ance of poor Gentlemen, who render themselves necessary and considerable by this liberty of their Vote and Suffrage.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this Liberty of Election and Voice, it was never known, that the States passed by any of the Children or Descendants of these Princes in their Elections, and when the direct Line of them hath failed, commonly chuse no Strangers (though
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>the <HI>Tartar</HI> hath put in for this Scepter) as could be instanced in the present King <HI>Casimir,</HI> and his Pre∣decessors, and the former Election of <HI>Stephen Ba∣thory,</HI> Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> who married the Sister of <HI>Sigismond</HI> the 2d. excepting <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>France:</HI> as now the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> Son of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> is like to succeed the present King, who hath no Issue of his own. This King is the second Son of <HI>Sigismond,</HI> who valiantly re∣pelled <HI>Sultan Osman</HI> 1622. Crowned at <HI>Cra∣covia</HI> in 1587. in consideration of <HI>Katherine Jagello</HI> his Mothers right, who was the Daughter of <HI>Sigismond</HI> the 1st. right Heir to the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as Son of <HI>John,</HI> eldest Brother to <HI>Charles,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gustav Ericus,</HI> who chased the <HI>Danes</HI> out of <HI>Sweden</HI> in 1560. by vertue of which Primo∣geniture, the <HI>Poles</HI> laid claim to the said Kingdom of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>As to the present <HI>Aspect</HI> of the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> something hath been hinted, as it is now engaged in a War with the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> the ordinary and usu∣al Employment of its Armes; which have the Great Duke (and sometimes the <HI>Tartar</HI>) for their con∣tinual Enemy, in the same nature as the <HI>Scots</HI> and We before the Union The old Quarrel is the de∣tainer of the Dutchy and City of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Moloch,</HI> taken first from the <HI>Pole,</HI> (to whose Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania</HI> they were annex∣ed) by <HI>Ivan Vasilowich</HI> the great <HI>Russian</HI> Tyrant, in the Reign of <HI>Sigismond Augustus;</HI> and after ma∣ny Changes and Vicissitudes, subdued again by this present Emperour in 1654. when the <HI>Swedes</HI> threatned <HI>Poland</HI> on the other side. Both Armies
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>are now in the Field (for neither of them value the weather) but the <HI>Russian</HI> will hardly put it to a deci∣sion by Battel, keeping himself encamped, unless up∣on great Advantages; but they are now upon Treaty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pole</HI> is otherwise at perfect Peace with all his Neighbours, having the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Cossacks,</HI> very various of adhaerence, to his assistance in this War; and he is pretty well assured at home, the Nobility having so sorely smarted for their Pride, and Dissentions, by the <HI>Swede;</HI> and the late Army of the Confaederates, notwithstanding the Grudges thereof, are wholly disbanded; but this course is ta∣ken to vent the Humour abroad. But he doth ill re∣quite the House of <HI>Austria</HI> (who undertook his as∣sistance in 1657. when the Emperour sent an Army of 16000. Men into <HI>Poland</HI>) in denying any aid or supply, or to concern himself in the Quarrel a∣gainst the <HI>Turk,</HI> from the constant Precedent and Policy of the former Kings; who lying so obnoxi∣ous to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> alwayes ready at the Beck of the <HI>Grand Seigniour,</HI> might endanger their own Estates. There is something to this purpose, a me∣morable Saying of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> to the Emperours Ambassadors; <HI>Let me see the Princes of</HI> Christendom <HI>at Peace and Unity, and I will not be backward in ap∣pearing against the Common Enemy.</HI> This Kingdom hath indeed suffered much by the <HI>Turk,</HI> as confi∣ning upon his Dominions; but how he will save his Stake, when he comes to be his nearer, and more potent Neighbour, by his designed Conquest of <HI>Hungary,</HI> Time must determine: At present he is resolved not to meddle or make with the bar∣barous Enemy, but await the issue, and keep
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>his League with them duly and inviolably.</P>
<P>This <HI>Casimir</HI> the 5th. succeeded his eldest Bro∣ther <HI>Uladislaus</HI> the 7th. after whose Death the Kingdom was dangerously afflicted with the Facti∣ons of the Nobility, and by the mutinous and re∣bellious <HI>Cossacks,</HI> who bordering Eastward upon <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Podolia,</HI> being part of the <HI>Cireassi∣ans,</HI> but Christianized according to the <HI>Greek</HI> Pro∣fession, of which there are several Bishops in <HI>Poland,</HI> have for some Ages since submitted to the Crown of <HI>Poland;</HI> but upon all occasions are ready to re∣volt, and to side with the <HI>Tartar, Russian,</HI> or any other People, for their advantage; as living chiefly upon spoyl, being a murderous and wild People: Nor will the Mischiefs caused by <HI>Chime∣linsky</HI> their General in the years 50, 1, 2, 3. be easily forgotten. The Wife of this <HI>Casimir</HI> (for∣merly an Ecclesiastique, and of the Order of Je∣suites, in his Brothers Reign) is a Daughter of the House of <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Nevers;</HI> unto which Family the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> is Married, which will have a great influence upon the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The Revenues of this King are Computed at 600000. Crowns <HI>per annum.</HI> arising chiefly out of Salt, and some Mines of Silver; which the King disposeth, either by making Portions for his Sons, or Kindred; for as to his Daughters, they are married at the Charge of the Kingdom. The War neither stands him in a Farthing of his own Treasure, for the Expence thereof is levyed upon the People by Excise or Taxes; as his Court Expences are born by the respective Places of his Residence: all the
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>Provinces partaking alike of the same Priviledges and Honours with <HI>Poland</HI> especially so called (which hath been one chief Policy to win them the better;) it seemeth reasonable, that they should equally partake with them in defraying the Charge.</P>
<P>The Interest of this Kingdom requires, that a good Understanding and Correspondence be main∣tained betwixt the King and the Nobility; not to quarrel with the <HI>Turk;</HI> to preserve Friendship with the <HI>Swede;</HI> to make Alliance with the <HI>Persi∣ans;</HI> and to keep the <HI>Tartars</HI> at home; to ruine the <HI>Muscovite;</HI> to have an eye upon the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> and to respect <HI>France,</HI> as that which can put a stop to the Imperial Armes, if they should enterprize upon that Kingdom.</P>

<P>BEfore we dismiss this Kingdom, we must men∣tion the Dutchy of <HI>Curland,</HI> being one third part of <HI>Livonia,</HI> the other two being called <HI>East∣land,</HI> and <HI>Lettenland,</HI> and a Soveraignty of it self, but held in Fee of the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> upon this account. <HI>Gothardus Ketler,</HI> a Noble <HI>Dane,</HI> the last of the <HI>Dutch</HI> great Masters in <HI>Livonia,</HI> having surrendred the Province to <HI>Sigismond Augustus</HI> in 1562, conditioned for his Investiture in this Dut∣chy, to him and his Heirs, but to be holden of
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>that Crown: Since which time, the Nobility ha∣ving accepted him as their Haereditary Prince, the succeeding Princes have continued Feudatories un∣to <HI>Poland,</HI> but are not reckoned as Parts or Mem∣bers of the Body thereof, for they come not to the Diets, nor have any Voice in the Election of the King, nor are lyable to any Taxes; but are ac∣counted, as indeed they are, Strangers, and not natural Lords or Peers of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The present Prince of the same Family of the <HI>Ketlers,</HI> is neer allyed to the Marquess of <HI>Branden∣burg,</HI> whose Sister is his Mother; so that for want of Issue, all those great Estates of the Elector, in the <HI>Ducall Prussia, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Cleve,</HI> &amp;c. will come to this Duke, as his next Heir. During the late <HI>Danish</HI> War in 1658. the <HI>Swede</HI> expecting some Invasions of this Duke, as being so interested in both his Enemies Cause and Quarrel, ordered General <HI>Dowglas</HI> to secure him; who surprized him in his Residence at <HI>Mittaw,</HI> by some Boats full of Souldiers, pretending for the <HI>Pole;</HI> and car∣ried him and his Dutchess away Prisoners; in which condition they contiued till the Peace was made and concluded between all Parties; so that he hath no great affection to that Nation. He is a Prince of little Power, as his Subjects of Trade, although his Country border upon the Sea, but it affords no convenient Harbour for Traffique any where in his Coast: Yet so much must be said for his Honour, that he supplyed our late Soveraign <HI>Charles</HI> the 1st. with two Ships loading of Armes, upon his own ac∣count, during those unnatural Wars in <HI>England;</HI> and was ready to do him any further Offices of Re∣spect and Friendship.</P>

<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> have formerly as much, nay more plagued this Country, than the Christian Enemies thereof; for by their frequent Conquest, and Invasi∣ons, they made the Great Duke their Tributary, with this kind of service to be performed by him, to the Emperour of the <HI>Praecopenses,</HI> or the Great <HI>Chrim Tartar;</HI> that is to say, every year, the <HI>Russian,</HI> on foot, fed the <HI>Chrim</HI>'s Horse, he sitting there∣on, with Oats, out of his Fur Cap,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1140.</NOTE> in his Castle of <HI>Musco;</HI> for commonly every year the <HI>Tartar</HI> (bordering nearer to him than seven dayes jour∣ney, at which distance he now stands) progressed thither as in State: whereas of late times he comes every other year likely, like a sudden Tempest; and having wasted and ruined the Country, and made up the number of his Captives, departs as hastily: unless the <HI>Sultan</HI> in person make it an Ex∣pedition Royal, or when the business comes to bat∣tel; where, if the <HI>Russian</HI> prevails, the War and Ravage is carried as far into the <HI>Tartars</HI> Country: But to prevent this danger, the <HI>Russian</HI> doth all he can to be at Peace with him, both by Bribes and Presents.</P>

<P>And it will not be unworthy the relation (as I my self in 1654. have been particularly informed in that Country, from the Deputy Governour of the Castle of <HI>Archangel</HI>) how the <HI>Tartar</HI> came to lose that Claim, his Hold and Soveraignty in this Kingdom; which the <HI>Russians</HI> ascribe to a certain Boyar (in the Reign of <HI>Basilius,</HI> some a 100. years since) or Nobleman, intrusted with a strong Castle of the Great Dukes, which the <HI>Tartar,</HI> upon the last reduction and subjugation of <HI>Russia</HI> (having compelled the Great Duke to sign an In∣strument of Vassalage and Fealty to him his supreme Lord) in his return besieged, no other Place then standing out against him. This Fortress he there∣fore strenuously attempted, withall intimating to the Governour, when he saw Force would not presently do, that his Master had himself yielded and submitted, and that it was to no purpose for him to resist, unless he had a mind to draw upon himself the Punishment of Treason: and to this purpose he had such a Writing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to produce. To this the prudent noble Governour made pre∣sent answer, that if such a thing were real, and he might see it, for his Justification to his Prince, up∣on the surrender, it should bind and conclude him; which the unpractised <HI>Tartar</HI> had no sooner sent into the Castle, but the Governour caused it presently to be torn into pieces, before the Mes∣sengers face, whom he returned with a more reso∣lute defiance than at first: And in fine, so long de∣layed him, and so wasted his Army, that the Great Duke resuming his Spirit, was making to his re∣lief; when the <HI>Tartar,</HI> in no condition to oppose

<P>As to the Temperature of the Air, it is govern∣ed solely by the Seasons of the Year, and vast is the difference betwixt Summer and Winter, when the Ground lies covered with Snow for seven Months; and the Cold is so rigid Northward, that Water cast into the Air, or dropped down will congeal in the way: And going out of a warm Room into a Cold, Men have sensibly perceived their Breath to wax stiff, and have been near stifled in drawing it in. Oftentimes Travellers are brought dead and stiffe in their Sledges to Towns, without any per∣ceivance of it while touched; so sudden and pier∣cing is the outrage of that Climate. In the Summer time, which lasts four Months, it is absolutely the most pleasantest Country in the World; the Mead∣dows so rarely green, such variety of Flowers, and melody of Birds, especially of <HI>Nightingales;</HI> which Verdure proceeds from the warmth the Snow keeps in the ground, &amp; when dissolved richly drencheth it.

The greater part is Meadow and Pasture, in which graze an innumerable quantity of Cattel; the Beef the best incomparably in the World, would it long endure Salt: other Flesh nothing near so good, except their Fruit of all sorts, and incredibly plentiful. There are also wild Beasts in abundance, famous for their Furrs, as the <HI>Sabel, Martin, Ermin,</HI> the rarest in the World. Their great Commodities they vent are Hides, and Tal∣low, Cavear, Hemp, and Tarr; Firre or Deal Planks they have the longest in the World.

<PB N="29" REF="22"/>in War; but strangely given to Sodomy, as are most of the <HI>Russians:</HI> The generality of whom, are a most malicious and perfidious People to one ano∣ther, so that they would steal Goods, and get them conveyed into their Enemies Houses; which Villany grew so frequent, that of late it hath been made highly Capital to commit it. They are like∣wise very theevish, and most cunning Knaves in their bargains, and impudent withall, to out-face any thing. They are spunged and fleeced by their Superiours, and therefore right or wrong they will make themselves whole. They are generally gi∣ven to drink, from which the Priests do not ab∣stain; and covet Tobacco, severely forbidden them, with which they will make themselves most abhominably drunk. In all the Oppression they suffer, they think rather better than worse of their Prince, and begin to reckon their Sins, and seri∣ously lament for having offended him. None of them ever stirrs out of the Country, unless with Ambassadours: nor Stranger neither, if once in, if he articled not for his liberty of return, except∣ing Merchants; who having formerly traded by the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea to the <HI>Narve,</HI> now sayl about the Northern Cape, in the great Ocean, to the <HI>Gran∣wick</HI> Bay, and so to the Port of St. <HI>Archangel,</HI> near the mouth of the River <HI>Duina.</HI> The other chief Cities of Trade are <HI>Volegda, Musco.</HI> The Imperial Residence <HI>Novogorod, Smolensko,</HI> &amp;c. The Language is a mixt <HI>Slavonian.</HI> The Religion is the same with the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, except in some Ceremonies of their own devising; being instru∣cted in the Christian Faith by some Priests sent
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>from the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to whom this Patrarch of <HI>Russia</HI> acknowledged subjection; but since a 100. years last past he hath withdrawn it, and the Patriarch is now nominated by the Empe∣rour, and Consecrated by his own Suffragans.</P>
<P>The Government is meerly Tyrannical and Ar∣bitrary, and comes nearest to that of the <HI>Turks,</HI> as one of the <HI>Viziers</HI> resembled them: For he is sole Executor to the Estates of deceased Persons, and sometimes too to those that are living; for if he sends for a Summ of Money to such a Person, of whose Wealth he hath information, it is presently sent him, without the least grumbling: and if he sends for his Head, it is sent him, with the same dispatch: And this may be, and is the Case some∣times also of the greatest Nobleman in the Empire; more frequently used to very great Barbarities in the Reign of that monstrous Tyrant <HI>Vasilowich.</HI></P>
<P>Since whose death, by reason of two preten∣ding Impostors, who usurped the Throne: and the Faction of the Grandees, who advanced o∣thers; the Nobility have had the Liberty of Elect∣ing their Prince: And yet such is their natural Fondness of Slavery, that they advanced their Fel∣low Subjects to the same unbounded Soveraignty. No Prince can be served in greater State: He sel∣dom sheweth himself unto the People, but in Ap∣parel of inestimable value, all glistering with Jewells; and in his Court, at any solemn Enter∣tainments of Ambassadors, the great Audience Chamber is furnished with all sorts of Plate of infi∣nite value, and filled with men in Vests of Cloth of Gold, which are ordinarily some grave well-Countenanced
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>Citizens, who for this purpose are apparelled out of his Wardrobe; a most glorious Cheat to such as know not the mystery of this Pomp and Magnificence.</P>
<P>His Revenues, by what hath been said, may be what he pleaseth himself; but these two last Princes have used a very moderate hand toward their Slaves, as they style themselves. His ordina∣ry means and way of amassing Treasure is, by en∣grossing or forestalling most of the homebred Com∣modities, (besides, all the Drink that is drawn in the Empire, is Farmed to his use; and a monthly account taken of the Cabacks or Victualing Houses, how much is spent, which must be presently satis∣fied to his Officers) and hindring all Trade till his own be sold, is a most vast and therefore uncertain Revenue. 2. By his Provision and Purveyance of Rent, Corn and Victual, raised some years to 200000. Rubbles, which Coyn makes little more than an Angel. 3. The Poll Money to 200. thou∣sand Pound Sterling. 4. His Customs, which a∣rise chiefly and solely from his Ports of <HI>Archangel</HI> and <HI>Astracan,</HI> to 400000 <HI>l.</HI> 5. By his own Do∣main, Escheats, and Forfeitures, and Presents: (very considerable on this account) All which may make up two Millions of Pounds Sterling, or two and a half at most; which were no great Sum, were he to pay for the service of all his Horsemen, who, like the <HI>Turks</HI> Timariots, have Farmes al∣lowed them.</P>
<P>As to his Forces, and the Militia of this Em∣pire, they are of a very formidable and considera∣ble Power: For first, He hath of his Dworancy,
<PB N="32" REF="24"/>or the Guard of his Person, 25000. Horsemen, who are alwayes in readiness where ever he resides. Then there are Lands let out to several of his great Men, which are never aliened from that use, on∣ly the present Proprietors changed at his pleasure; for the Profits whereof, they are bound to main∣tain 65000. Horse more; and these likewise are alwayes to be ready at sound of Trumpet; which makes a standing Body of 90000. which with Of∣ficers, and other Voluntiers, are effectually in the Field a hundred thousand.</P>
<P>Besides these, He may raise what additional Numbers the Country will afford; whish is so plen∣tiful of Horse, that it is said, he is able to bring 300000. into the Campania: but it is of the o∣ther side supposed, he cannot find so many Riders by one half; especially considering, that at the same time as these Horse are in service, his Foot hardly exceed the number of 40000. not only, for that he confides not in his Infantry, as unapt to the War: but because of the thinness of his Countries. Of late years he hath found out a way to supply that defect, by entertaining foreign Foot, chiefly <HI>Germans,</HI> and once some <HI>English,</HI> about the year 1633. in a Regiment transported by Collonel <HI>Sanderson,</HI> amounting to near 3000. Men; at which time he besieged <HI>Smolensko,</HI> (once a Province, under the protection of the <HI>Pole;</HI> di∣stant Southwest 80. <HI>Polonian</HI> Miles from <HI>Mosco;</HI> taken by <HI>Vasilowich,</HI> and retaken by the <HI>Poles</HI> in 1610. with the loss of 200000. <HI>Muscovites</HI>) two years together; at last came the <HI>Pole,</HI> when the <HI>Russian</HI> was wearied out, and besieged the Be∣siegers,
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>and reduced them by Famine to a surren∣der: For which the General lost his Head at <HI>Mus∣co,</HI> although Cosen of the Emperour; and his Son was whipp'd to death, as was the Major General; the Lieutenant General escaped at the intercession of the <HI>English,</HI> who had done excellent service, (and had taught the <HI>Russians</HI> how to stand a Shock of the <HI>Poles</HI> Lances, and to break their Troops) and could give a handsome Character of perform∣ance, as to his part; ever since which time the <HI>English</HI> Officers have been highly respected and preferred.</P>
<P>This Emperour therefore is better provided of Foot than any of his Predecessors, who could ne∣ver make 20000. and therefore lost that they had gained, because they wanted those standing De∣fences to make good their ground; having trained up a number of his own Subjects to the Discipline, and by the example of Strangers; so that he is able to bring near 50000. into the Field, if necessity require.</P>
<P>He is excellently and infinitely stored, as much as any Prince in <HI>Christendom,</HI> with all manner of Artillery great and small, with Ammunition and Provision sutable. His Souldiers most patient of Cold and Hunger, and sustained with little: but better to maintain a Fortress, than to assault it, or engage in Battel: Notwithstanding, they will do what they are commanded, in the most present dangers, but it is not out of boldness or bravery of Spirit.</P>
<P>They have been twice invaded with the <HI>Turks</HI> alone (not joyned with the <HI>Tartars</HI>) the first
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>time was in the Reign of <HI>Vasilowich,</HI> in 1569. when <HI>Selymus</HI> the Second attempted to cut a Navi∣gable Trench betwixt the <HI>Tanais,</HI> and the River <HI>Volga;</HI> and brought his Fleet out of the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea: but the <HI>Russian</HI> overthrew his Forces, and spoyled his Navy and Design together. The o∣ther was in 1598. by 70000. of them, in the Winter time; 40000. of whom were presently nummed and killed with the Cold, not knowing the <HI>Russians</HI> preventing Chirugery; which is to rub their Nose and Ears every foot with Ice or Snow, to recall the motive Spirits to those parts, which otherwise they might lose: the remainder ran home to catch themselves a heat; since which time the <HI>Turk</HI> hath never troubled this Country: Nor doth the <HI>Russian</HI> think it worth his pains to in∣vade his Southward upon the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea, being parted from all other his Territories by <HI>Poland, Moldavia,</HI> and <HI>Transylvania;</HI> so that without their leave, he can attempt nothing against him: and their leave he is never like to have, unless invinci∣ble necessity and calamity perswade it.</P>
<P>His continual Goads and Thorns are on the West of his Dominions, the <HI>Pole,</HI> and the <HI>Swede;</HI> to whom he hath lost more than he hath gained of the <HI>Tartar:</HI> Notwithstanding, since the Empire hath been setled in this new Family, whereof there have been but two Princes in the tract of near 50. years; especially in the Reign of this present Great Duke, they have not got much Ground: nay, the <HI>Pole</HI> hath lost the Dutchy of <HI>Smolensko</HI> in 1654. with some other Places, which is the present Quar∣rel and Cause of this <HI>Polish</HI> Expedition.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
<P>The Peace with the <HI>Swede,</HI> which the <HI>Russian</HI> prefers, hath been long in agitation, by reason it is clogged with so many Demands, and nice Claims of both Parties; but it is believed, the <HI>Russian</HI> must quit many of his Pretensions and Punctilioes, lest that Negotiation take no Effect, and the <HI>Swede</HI> take advantage. Little else can be said of this Mo∣narch, as to his Interest in <HI>Europe,</HI> where he was never further concerned, than these two Provin∣ces of <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Livonia;</HI> and scarce known to our Parts, till almost 90. years since: They main∣taining Correspondence with Us in point of Commerce only, and with our Nation especial Friendship and Affection, particularly towards the Soveraignes of <HI>England:</HI> Besides, they are of very little or no Address, there being not a Schollar a∣mong them, for even their Priests can but read.</P>
<P>Furthermore, They never made any Alliance by Marriage with any Christian or Neighbour Prin∣ces, but chuse their Wives from among their own Subjects: nor do they marry their Princes Children to them; in this, like the <HI>Grand Seigniour,</HI> whose Policy they resemble; and certainly this is some secret Principle of State; for it is not many years agoe, since <HI>Wolmar,</HI> the Brother to the present King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> came thither a Suitor to one of the Sisters of the Emperour, and was there nuzled with a fruitless Expectation of a Match, but in conclusion had much adoe to escape out of their Dominion. In sum, They care not for, indeed ab∣hor, the Introduction of new Customes, and to that purpose prohibit Communication with Strangers, as the only bane of their Government: nor must a
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>Foreigner stir abroad without leave, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And lastly, They are so Proudly conceited of their own Prudence, that they think their Politiques the most perfect and absolute in the World.</P>
<P>No question he would lend his <HI>Hand</HI> against the <HI>Turk</HI> (if for no other Cause than the Vindication of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, of which he is the sole So∣veraign Protector) but it is not <HI>Long</HI> enough, and will not reach that distant Enemy, but by the wayes aforesaid.</P>
<P>The present Emperours Name is <HI>Alexei Micha∣lowich,</HI> that is, the Son of <HI>Michael,</HI> which is all the Sir-name they use, both Prince and People: His Fathers Christian Name being <HI>Michael Fedorowitz,</HI> the Son of <HI>Theodore,</HI> who was Patriarch of <HI>Musco.</HI> This <HI>Michael,</HI> the Nobles (having been twice imposed on by the <HI>Polanders,</HI> who brought in two counterfeit Princes, named <HI>Demetrius,</HI> pretend∣ed Sons of <HI>Vasilowich,</HI> the last Prince but one of the Royal Blood; and in their quarrel subdued <HI>Mosco,</HI> and almost ruined the Empire) weary of their own Confusions, and the intollerable oppression of the <HI>Poles,</HI> unanimously chose for their Emperour; who setled the State, and managed it in a more constant way of Peace with the <HI>Turk, Tartar, Pole,</HI> and <HI>Swede,</HI> than any of his Predecessors had done be∣fore him. He began his Reign in 1615. and died in 1646. much lamented and adored of his Slaves, as well for his foreign Acts, as those at home; and for his Justice and Moderation: And so we pass Westward to the Kingdom of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>SWEDEN:</HI> OR Swethland.</HEAD>
<P>THis Kingdom is bounded on the East with <HI>Muscovy;</HI> on the West with great Hills, which divide it from <HI>Norway;</HI> on the North with the great Frozen Ocean; and on the South with <HI>Donmark, Livonia,</HI> and the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea. For the quantity, reckoning in <HI>Lapland,</HI> it exceedeth <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> by 900. Miles: and for fertility, if you count Wells, Stones, Mountains, and Lakes; it excelleth them both likewise: but <HI>Goth∣land</HI> and <HI>Finland</HI> are excellently well stored with all Necessaries, and supply their Neighbours with Malt and Barley.</P>
<P>The Religion is <HI>Lutheran,</HI> introducted by <HI>Gu∣stavus Ericus,</HI> or <HI>de Vasa,</HI> descended from the last King <HI>Magnus,</HI> who coveted the Revenues of the Church, but kept up the Episcopal Dignity, who have Voices in Parliament. The <HI>Swedish</HI> Gentleman is a well-accomplish'd and gallant Per∣son, a good Souldier, and a good Captain, un∣derstands the Politiques, and speaks most Langua∣ges. They are something fierce and insolent on
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>advantage, but it is in War, which excuseth it. The People are naturally strong and active, pro∣vident, patient and industrious; are very humble, and hospitable to Strangers; and in the Northern Parts so healthy, that they live commonly to the Age of 130. or 140. years; and this is imputed to the purity of the Air, but sometimes over-cast with Foggs, by reason the Inhabitants neglect the Water-courses of their miry standing Lakes. Of no great note for Arts or Armes, till that <HI>Gustavus Ericus,</HI> who chased out the <HI>Danes,</HI> under their King <HI>Christiern</HI> the 3d. and <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> whose Conquests were admirable, and his Conduct not to be matched by any Parallel: They are ex∣ceeding apt to learn the Mechanick Arts, so that every Souldier is his own Smith, Cutler, Car∣penter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They are very Valiant, both their Horse and Foot, as they have given good proof, both in <HI>Germany, Poland, Russia,</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI> Their Religion is wholly <HI>Lutheran;</HI> Bishops they have, whom they call Surintendents, and who retain their Voice in Parliaments, but have no set∣led Church Revenue, being paid and maintained by the King, with an inconsiderable yearly Pen∣sion.</P>
<P>The whole Kingdom is divided into two Parts, the one lying on the East, the other on the West side of the Gulph or Bay of <HI>Bodner,</HI> or <HI>Sinus Bod∣dicus,</HI> a spacious Branch of the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea; ac∣cording to which division there are, 1. the Pro∣vince of <HI>Gottoland.</HI> 2. Of <HI>Sweden,</HI> lying on the West side. And 3. <HI>Lapland,</HI> on the North. 4. <HI>Bodden.</HI> 5. <HI>Finland.</HI> And 6. the <HI>Swedish Islands;</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>so that He is a Prince of no small Territory: but, like the <HI>Russian,</HI> he is not very Populous, by rea∣son of those cold Regions, which none but Sava∣ges inhabit, under a certain tribute of Furrs; of which this King hath his share from the <HI>Lap∣landers.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Government, it is Monarchical and Absolute to the King <HI>in Actu,</HI> but the Senators pretend it to be Elective, although the Son hath continually succeeded his Father in the Govern∣ment, which was made a Sanction by the States, at the instance of the same <HI>Ericus,</HI> who would not ac∣cept of the Crown, urged upon him, without such a Law: and this hath prevailed ever since, but in the Case of <HI>Sigismond,</HI> beaten out of <HI>Swe∣den</HI> by the Faction of <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Suderman</HI> his Uncle: for we have seen the Infant Son of the late <HI>Charles Gustavus</HI> advanced immediately upon his Fathers death to the Throne. And when the King is once seated there, he governs <HI>pro imperio,</HI> for he layes what Taxes he pleaseth, as 5, 6, 7, 8, Dollars yearly upon every Housholder, accor∣ding to his quality: And that which is chief, all Appeals for final Determination are made to him, not to his Parliament or Council.</P>
<P>This Kings Revenue consisteth in four things, the Tenths of Ecclesiastical Livings, Mines, Tri∣butes, and Customes. 1. The Revenues of the Church arise to a great Summ, consisting before the Reformation of seven Bishopricks, and sixty Monasteries, which enjoyed very great Possessi∣ons, now incorporated into the Crown, except only some small maintenance to the Bishops, as a∣bovesaid.
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>2. His Mines, a great deal more con∣siderable, for that his tenth part of three Copper Works, almost a hundred years agoe, yielded him 3000. Dollars, whereby estimation may be made of his Silver and Gold. And those Mines may be found in every place, if the Country Peo∣ple (bound to carry wood, and do other servile work there) did not hide and hinder the disco∣very. Most fine Silver is found in the Province of <HI>Vestras,</HI> were it not for the envy and jealousie of the Inhabitants, either murmuring that Strangers should be employed, or suspecting that they should be over-reached; so that his Revenue is mightily hindred by this means. 3. But his Taxes do far surpass all his other Incomes, for he levyeth the Tenth of Rye, Wheat, Barley, Fish, Skins, Oxen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of the Tenth of Oxen he hath ga∣thered at some times 18000. Dollars, with all which he maintaineth his Court, Officers, Navy, and Armies. In the time of War with <HI>Dane</HI> or <HI>Muscovite,</HI> his Neighbours, he alloweth his Soul∣diers Victuals, which by his Taxes he provideth at easie Rates: He giveth them likewise a Coat or Cassock every year, which maketh them ever fully ready to obey his Commands. The Marriage of the Kings Daughters is at the disposal of the Senate, who give them for their Portion, besides Silver, Plate, and other Gifts, a 100000. Dollars. Of the Uplandish People, which pay not the Impost of Victuals, the King is accustomed to exact of e∣very Poll acording to his ability, five Dollars or more yearly. 4. His Customes, that are paid in the Haven Towns, the Chief whereof in <HI>Sweden</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>are <HI>Caymare, Lodhuys,</HI> and <HI>Stockholme,</HI> where at some times four hundred Ships of Burden lye at Anchor: Also <HI>Auge, Revel, Riga, Parnovia,</HI> and the <HI>Narve.</HI></P>
<P>But these Customes are much improved since the Confirmation of his Acquists in <HI>Germany,</HI> by the <HI>Munster</HI> Treaty 1648. by which he had the Upper <HI>Pomerania,</HI> the Inheritance of the Marquess of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> with the City of <HI>Wismar,</HI> in the Dutchy of <HI>Mecklenbury,</HI> and Isle of <HI>Rugia,</HI> with the Bishopricks of <HI>Bremen</HI> and <HI>Verden,</HI> &amp;c. bor∣dering along the other side of the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea; by which he hath a wide inlet into <HI>Germany,</HI> given him in recompence of those Places he had Conquered in the more inward Parts: so that this great addition of Territory, hath made him a far more considera∣ble Prince than ever he was; and the <HI>Dane</HI> by sad Experience found as much in that War he managed against him in 1658. when, by the Conjunction and Contiguity of those <HI>German</HI> Provinces, he speeded without Obstruction out of <HI>Poland,</HI> to stop the Progress of the <HI>Danish</HI> Armes, and with speedy success reduced that King by the Agreement at <HI>Rosckeild,</HI> to a very petty and pittant Sove∣raignty; for thereby as good as one half of his King∣dom was passed over to the <HI>Swede,</HI> the Principal Member whereof was <HI>Schoneland,</HI> one of the fruit∣fullest Provinces, but formerly belonging to <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> with some other Places, particularly the great <HI>Bayliwick</HI> of <HI>Drontheim</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> which would have dis-membred that Kingdom, and rend∣red the <HI>Dane</HI> but a precarious Prince of the rest: But this, and divers other former Concessions by
<PB N="42" REF="29"/>that Treaty, were annihilated or retrenched by the succeeding Agreement, in the <HI>Swedes</HI> Leageur before <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> after their Defeat in the As∣sault of that Town, by the Mediation and Guaran∣ty of the <HI>English, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Ambassa∣dors, in <HI>May</HI> 1660. nevertheless <HI>Schoneland</HI> re∣mained to the <HI>Swede,</HI> with some of the <HI>Baltique</HI> Islands; and other Places, not to be particularized in this Discourse.</P>
<P>All which Estates being laid and joyned together in some manner, it were supposable at first view, that he might easily render himself Master of the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea: but when it is again considered, of what strength the <HI>Dane,</HI> the <HI>Hanse</HI> Towns are, as <HI>Lubeck, Hamborough, Dantzick;</HI> together with the Interest of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Trade therein, it will seem a tougher matter, and too big for his Na∣val strength, which yet of it self is very considera∣ble: No doubt the <HI>Swede</HI> hath chawed deliciously upon the Design, but could never digest it; it sufficeth him at present, that his Ships are Toll free as they pass the <HI>Sound:</HI> and that he enjoyeth other Priviledges, which the Violence of his Armes have purchased him, of the Princes his Neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>As to the Force of this Kingdom, it hath been perceived of what Effect and Puissance it is, by that War it carried on, under the late King <HI>Charles Gustavus,</HI> against the <HI>Pole,</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> and the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> at one and the same time: But truly, I cannot tell, whether I may ascribe those Numbers of Men, with which they have enterprised so much lately, either to the Production of their own
<PB N="43" REF="29"/>Country, or their Fortune, which hath drawn so many Foreigners into their service, in which there is a certainty of Pay, and general good respect had to them, if they prove men of desert. It is cer∣tain, that in the late <HI>Danish</HI> War, he had above sixty thousand men in Pay, which is a number that few Princes can long maintain together; and yet such is the good luck of these Martial Princes, that they have been served faithfully, without any Pay, for many Months together, as certain of Satisfacti∣on somewhere, either by the <HI>Swede,</HI> or from the Enemy, who is looked upon as very good Se∣curity, in all the Undertakings of this Prince.</P>
<P>As to the Policy of this Kingdom, having touch∣ed before, that the Government is Monarchical, we will briefly describe the menage of it: Matters of Peace, and War, of Embassyes, and Allian∣ces, are proposed by the King to the Senate, for their Resolution, which the Senators deliver with an entire Liberty, and most Voices carry it: but if it happen, that the Vote be contrary to the Kings purposes, he will assemble the States Gene∣ral, to obtain of them what he cannot of the Se∣nate. These Estates are composed of the Nobility, of the Clergy, of Merchants, and of the Peasants of the King; that is to say, Peasants that serve not Gentlemen (in <HI>English</HI> Yeomen) but subsist of themselves.</P>
<P>The Nobles that sit in such Parliaments, or Estates General, are of the eldest of their Families: the Church sends two Priests of every Community or Diocess, the Cities two Merchants, and every Shire two of its Inhabitants: These four Bodies
<PB N="44" REF="30"/>consider of the Kings Will and Demand, and by the major Voice determine of it; if their Voices be equal, the King makes the Election himself, and gives the casting Voice for his own Designes and Interest: All other Matters are referred to one of these seven Councills, <HI>viz.</HI> The Council of Justice, where presides the Lord Chief Justice, assisted by four Senators, six Gentlemen, and six Doctors. 2. The Council of War, where pre∣sides the Constable, assisted by four Senators Mar∣shalls. 3. The Council of the Admiralty, where presides the High Admiral, with four Senators Vice-Admiralls. 4. The Chancery, where pre∣sides the High Chancellour, assisted with four Se∣nators, and the Secretaries of State. 5. The Council of the Revenue, where presides the High Treasurer, assisted by four Senators, [These five Officers are called the five great Lords, and are Tutors of the King, and govern the Kingdom ab∣solutely, during his Minority, being now in the 8th. year of his age.] 6. The Council of Trade, where a Senator is President, assisted by four more of the same rank and order. 7. The Council of the Mountains (as we have of the Marshes) where sit the same number and quality of Persons as in the Council of Trade. The whole Kingdom, into which are reckoned the late Acquists, is divided into five Governments General, <HI>viz.</HI> Of <HI>Finland,</HI> of <HI>Ingermanland,</HI> of <HI>Liefland,</HI> of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and <HI>Schonen;</HI> and obeys four great Presidents of Ju∣stice: He of <HI>Finland</HI> holds Judicatory at <HI>Obo,</HI> He of <HI>Ingermanland</HI> and <HI>Schonen</HI> at <HI>Norkopin,</HI> the third of <HI>Liefland</HI> at <HI>Dort,</HI> and of <HI>Pomerania</HI> at
<PB N="45" REF="30"/><HI>Wismar;</HI> and acknowledges twenty nine Lieute∣nant Generalls, Governours of Provinces for the King.</P>
<P>The Interest of <HI>Sweden,</HI> is to keep and maintain Peace with the <HI>Muscovite;</HI> to alarum equally, and to divide <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> not to quarrel by any means with the <HI>Hollander;</HI> and to esteem and highly respect their strict Confaederacy with <HI>France;</HI> and to seek all occasions of a War in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> to be therein assisted with the <HI>French</HI> Mo∣ney and Supplies; not to neglect the friendship of the King of <HI>England,</HI> who can, when he pleaseth, interest himself in any Difference in the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea, by a potent Umpirage.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Turk,</HI> they are not over-forward in that service, as expecting nothing but blows for other mens sakes; nevertheless, as the King is a Prince of the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is also a Prince and Mem∣ber of the Circle of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></NOTE> made so by the aforesaid Treaty at <HI>Munster,</HI> he is obliged, and hath ac∣cordingly sent away his Aides into <HI>Hungary:</HI> but so unwelcome is the Nation to the <HI>Germans,</HI> that they had like to have been engaged, and set upon, in their passage near <HI>Erford,</HI> by those whom they came to assist; so that they have little encourage∣ment to that service: Besides, He is in League, or some rude manner of Friendship with the <HI>Tar∣tar,</HI> who merited of him well in the <HI>Polish</HI> War; and he himself is so great an Invader, and Souldier of Fortune, that Religion, or its Interest, weighs little with him, however our Puritans cried up the Great <HI>Gustavus</HI> for a Zealot: All therefore that will be done by him in this Affair, will be more out of necessity, and the Laws and Decree of the
<PB N="46" REF="31"/>Empire, and the Example of other Princes, than his own Choice and Generosity: And so we pass to his Neighbour the <HI>Dane.</HI></P>

<P><HI>DENMARK</HI> is bounded on the East and South with the <HI>Baltique Sea:</HI> On the North with <HI>Norwey</HI> (bounded on the West and North with the <HI>German</HI> and Frozen Sea) and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and on the West the said <HI>German</HI> Ocean. The entire Body of this Kingdom was made up principally in form of three Parts; The First is the Realm of <HI>Denmark,</HI> containing both the <HI>Jutlands,</HI> part of <HI>Scandia</HI> adjoyning upon the <HI>Swedes</HI> Country, as <HI>Halland</HI> (and <HI>Schonen,</HI> which is now in the <HI>Swedes</HI> possession) and the Islands of the <HI>Baltique Sea.</HI> 2. <HI>Norwey,</HI> To which must be added the Islands of <HI>Iceland</HI> and <HI>Freezeland</HI> (in the Northern Ocean, where such abundance of Cod is taken by the <HI>Dutch</HI> the <HI>Danes</HI> and Us) of large extent, but of little benefit to this Crown. 3. The Dukedome of <HI>Holstein</HI> containing 4. Provinces, but now exempt from the Kingdom, and other Jurisdicti∣ons added to the said Dukedom, which are like∣wise
<PB N="47" REF="31"/>aliened from <HI>Denmark,</HI> of which more here∣after.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Denmark</HI> lyeth partly in the <HI>Cimbrick Chersoness</HI> adjoyned to the Dukedom of <HI>Holstein,</HI> as both the <HI>Jutlands</HI> (out of which some part is newly borrowed, to adde to the said Dut∣chy) divided into several Districts; and partly in <HI>Scandia,</HI> but principally in the Islands. As for the Dutchy of <HI>Holstein,</HI> it hath of late years been unfortunate to the <HI>Danes,</HI> being over-run by the Imperialists in 1628. in the Reign of <HI>Christiern</HI> the 4th. but honestly restored by the Emperour upon easie Conditions: Then it was harrassed by the <HI>Swede</HI> in 1643. and 4. and now finally freed by them from the Crown of <HI>Denmark,</HI> only the best part of <HI>Jutland</HI> remaines in its pristine obedi∣ence. In <HI>Scandia, Schonen</HI> being gone, <HI>Hal∣land</HI> and <HI>Blecking</HI> is all he holds there; and indeed they are fine Provinces, but the unkind separation of their Sister of <HI>Schonen</HI> (which signifies Beauti∣ful) renders them a little unpleasant to the Kings view and prospect.</P>
<P>So that his chiefest strength of his Dominions lies in the Islands, in number 35. two of which, <HI>Zeland,</HI> and <HI>Fuenen</HI> or <HI>Fionia,</HI> are most consider∣able, and made more eminently famous by the late <HI>Swedish</HI> War; the Latter, for the Passage of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> over to it upon the Sea on the Ice, with Horse, Foot, and his great Artillery, with the loss only of two Troops: and the Defeat of his Forces there afterwards, by the Confaederate Ar∣mies: The Other, for the Castle of <HI>Cronenburg,</HI> that guards the <HI>Sound;</HI> and <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> the Royal
<PB N="48" REF="32"/>Residence of the Kings of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and which, for almost two years space, withstood a most per∣rillous Siege, and finally beat off the <HI>Swedes</HI> with great loss, and thereby overthrew all their De∣signes, which proved in effect the death of that King. It is a low Town, ordinarily built, and hath nothing of Magnificence in it, but the Spirit of the Inhabitants; the Kings Palace being no ex∣traordinary Building, save that its covered with Copper.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Norway,</HI> toward the North, is separated from <HI>Lapland</HI> by high and craggy Rocks, and the Eastern and Western Parts are hard to travel for the same reason. The Land is not ve∣ry fruitful of Corn, and therefore the Inhabitants (the meaner sort) eat Stockfish, which trans∣ported into other Parts, is exchanged for Corn. The Inhabitants are naturally honest, and not a Thief among them; and very Civil to Strangers; and formerly very Martial, for these People were first called <HI>Normans,</HI> and were Ancestors to our Conquerours; but such is the hard Condition un∣der which they are kept by the <HI>Danes,</HI> though in appearance Fellow Subjects, ever since the Union of the two Kingdomes, by the Marriage of <HI>Aquinus</HI> in 1359. with <HI>Margaret</HI> the Daughter and Heir of <HI>Waldemar</HI> the 3d. of <HI>Denmark,</HI> (the Issue of which Marriage died, and left this Kingdom to the Usurpation of his Mother <HI>Margaret,</HI> whose Suc∣cessors have continued it to this day) that the <HI>Nor∣wegians</HI> have wholly lost their Courage, and for∣mer Valour, not being suffered to go out of the Kingdom to traffique their own Commodities;
<PB N="49" REF="32"/>which, besides Fish; are rich Furrs, Tallow, Butter, Tann'd Leather, Train Oyl, Pitch, Clap-board, Masts, Deal-boards, and Fire-wood; from the Custom whereof ariseth the Kings greatest Profits, being received for him at <HI>Bergen</HI> and <HI>Wardhouse;</HI> but this Revenue is very inconsidera∣ble. The whole Realm is divided into five Lieu∣tenancies or Governments, which in this unculti∣vated remote Country, will not concern us in any particulars, no more than the appendixed Islands above mentioned.</P>
<P>Having thus summarily discoursed of the Parts of this Kingdom, we will briefly mention the Go∣vernment, which having been placed in an Haere∣ditary Monarchy from the Foundation of this Estate, was challenged as Elective by the Usurped Power of the Nobles and People, by their Depo∣sing of <HI>Ericus</HI> about 1420. and Electing his Cosen <HI>Christopher,</HI> Count Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> who dying without Issue, they again chose <HI>Adolph,</HI> Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> who excusing himself by reason of his age, by his advice, they chose his Nephew <HI>Christiern,</HI> Earl of <HI>Oldenburg,</HI> who brought both those Estates to this Crown: Since when they con∣tinued the fashion of an Election (but never pas∣sed by the next Heir) until the year 1660. when, in consideration of this Kings extraordinary Care, Valour and Vigilance in defence of his People a∣gainst the <HI>Swedes,</HI> they resolved to restore what they had so long detained, by returning the Go∣vernment into the old Channel, and making it a∣gain Haereditary in the Family of this Prince al∣though with much reluctancy and discontent of ma∣ny of the Grandees.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="33"/>
<P>By which change, so lately made, there can no perfect account be given of the present administra∣tion, being solely at the Kings disposal, as it is with other absolute Monarchs. As to the Nobles, they are reputed the most antient of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Gentry the like; and to preserve and main∣tain that honourable Esteem, they never match into Plebeian Families, but keep their Blood un∣mix'd and pure in its first Current. The Gentry are neither so fierce, nor so subtle as their Neigh∣bours; and are very generous and hospitable to Strangers. The People generally thrifty and dili∣gent in their Callings, and of very good converse and civility. The Religion is altogether <HI>Lutheran,</HI> but the Bishops have more Authority, and better Maintenance here than in <HI>Sweden:</HI> but I know not what they do for a Metropolitan, since the Archi-Episcopal See of <HI>Londen</HI> in <HI>Schonen,</HI> which was the Primacy of <HI>Denmark,</HI> was assigned to the <HI>Swede.</HI> In elder times this Church depended upon the Arch-Bishoprick of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and then the el∣dest Son of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> (which was in use till the Treaty of <HI>Munster</HI>) was stiled the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Bremen;</HI> but that dependance was re∣moved to <HI>London</HI> above 500. years since, and whether it will be removed now, is uncer∣tain.</P>
<P>The Strength of this Kingdom is mostly Naval, the <HI>Danes</HI> proving better Water than Land Souldi∣ers, and more affecting the Employment; yet of modern times, they have dared also by Land; their Conquest of <HI>Sweden</HI> was not above 300. years agoe; (not to mention their old Conquests with
<PB N="51" REF="33"/>Us) in 1628. they enterprised upon the Empe∣rour, in behalf of the Liberty of <HI>Germany</HI> (of which, as Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> he was a free Prince) although unfortunately: Nevertheless, the Enemy could not but acknowledge the Gallan∣try of King <HI>Christiern,</HI> and dealt with him accor∣dingly: Since which time they were willing to be at quiet, till the opportunity of the <HI>Polish</HI> War in∣vited this King <HI>Frederick</HI> the 3d. to revenge the injurious Violence done to his Country of <HI>Holstein,</HI> by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in 1643. and 4. which was acted partly by the instigation of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who per∣ceiving the <HI>Dane</HI> screwed up the Rate of the Toll Money in the <HI>Sound,</HI> for which by an old Treaty those <HI>Netherlands</HI> were to pay but a Rose-Noble for every Ship, without searching or visiting: (and this was paid, because of the Lights, Tuns, and Marks at Sea, kept and maintained by the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> which Payment, from the time of their separation from <HI>Spain,</HI> he had raised at his own pleasure, searching the Ships, and seizing the Goods, under pretence of <HI>Contrebanda,</HI> or prohibited Merchandise) By a League made in 1640. with the <HI>Swede,</HI> they insinuated this Grie∣vance, which also offended that Queens Subjects; so that in conclusion, the <HI>Dane,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Swedes</HI> Land Forces, and the appearance of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, was forced to a new Agreement with the <HI>Hollander,</HI> at a set easie rate, for the Toll; which afterwards in 1650. (having made the like defensive League with the <HI>Dane</HI>) they Farmed at 140000. Peices of 8. <HI>per annum.</HI> for some term, with a Proviso and Caution of not be∣ing
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>searched for any Goods, the Master only de∣claring what they were,</P>
<P>To return to an account of his Forces, they may be thus computed. First, Such as the Nobi∣lity and Gentry are bound to raise for the publique service, which are a considerable number. And, Secondly, What the People furnish upon such oc∣casions; and these have formerly amounted to great Armies: But the strength of the Kingdom is now exhausted, and it is yet able to do little.</P>
<P>The preceding discourse leads me to consider of this Kings Revenue, which chiefly consists in his Toll upon Ships aforesaid, (for he makes little of his own Customes, Fish being his greatest Com∣modity, and no great Port of Trade in all his Realm) which hath fallen much since his late Agreement with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have the sole Trade here almost; and more by the Northern Pas∣sage to <HI>Russia,</HI> found out many years since. He had also a Toll of 50000. Oxen, which went year∣ly out of <HI>North Jutland</HI> into <HI>Germany</HI> by <HI>Holstein,</HI> but the Duke now receives that at his Toll-house, erected at his Residence of <HI>Gottorp.</HI> There are al∣so some Crown Lands, but they do not amount to any considerable Revenue.</P>
<P>The Interest of <HI>Denmark</HI> is, by no means to dis-oblige the Emperour, as his surest Friend a∣gainst the <HI>Swede;</HI> nor the <HI>Hollander,</HI> unless upon insolent Encroachments, against which he hath the King of <HI>England,</HI> his nearest Ally, to a sure Friend and Defence; to watch and keep fair with the <HI>Swede,</HI> his constant and natural Enemy; and to that purpose, to keep the <HI>Russian</HI> alwayes en∣jealousied
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>of their Greatness; to be at League with all the <HI>German</HI> Princes, and make his Interest as strong with them as is possible; to be perpetual∣ly Confaederated with the <HI>Pole,</HI> Offensively and Defensively; and so to cherish the <HI>French</HI> Kings Friendship, as to keep him a Neuter betwixt the <HI>Swede</HI> and himself; Lastly, to love and respect the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> above all other Friendships whatsoever. With other Princes than these he hath no Concern, only a civil Correspondence with <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> in point of Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>What he can do against the <HI>Turk,</HI> or what Sup∣ply he can give the Emperour, may appear by the preceding Discourse, the late Wars having utterly disabled him, so that, besides his good will, and his Prayers, he can no way advantage the Christian Cause, without much despoyling and injuring him∣self, which that Occasion cannot expect, and perchance will not need. And it is most certain, that the <HI>Turk</HI> took his Resolution of the late Inva∣sion, from the Embarassement and Difference be∣tween these two Northern Kings, in which the Emperour, the <HI>Pole,</HI> and the Marquess of <HI>Bran∣denburg,</HI> were so far engaged; so that having suf∣fered sufficiently, and he being the only loser upon that account, he may well be excused: And so we pass to the Dutchy of <HI>Holstein.</HI></P>

<HEAD>HOLSTEIN.</HEAD>
<P>THis Dutchy of <HI>Holstein</HI> ought to have been referred to the Survey of <HI>Germany,</HI> of which this Duke is a Prince, although he never comes to the Imperial Diets, nor is subject to any imposi∣tions or Taxes laid upon the Empire; only in case of Appeal some Causes have been carried to the Rix-Chamber at <HI>Spiers,</HI> which are now disconti∣nued, because of its former dependance to the Crown of <HI>Denmark,</HI> to which it was annexed some Ages since by the Election of <HI>Christopher</HI> Count of <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> Heir to <HI>Adolph</HI> last Duke hereof, and hath remained as the Title and posses∣on of the eldest Son, or the younger brothers of the said Crown, we will not dis-joyn it from this entire view of both together.</P>
<P>It is seated in the Southern part of the <HI>Cimbrick Chersoness,</HI> or the <HI>Peninsula</HI> made by the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea on the <HI>German</HI> shore, and is divided from the <HI>Danish</HI> Provinces of <HI>Jutland</HI> by the River <HI>Eydore:</HI> It contains four Provinces, <HI>viz. Heagerland,</HI> in west near the Sea, and the fall of two Rivers, <HI>Lu∣beck</HI> is seated, a famous Hanse Town, neatly built, and well traded, but of more estimation in
<PB N="55" REF="35"/>former times. 2ly. <HI>Stormarsh,</HI> whereupon the <HI>Elbe</HI> stands. <HI>Hamburgh</HI> another Hanse Town, and of late more famed than <HI>Lubeck</HI> (by reason of the <HI>English</HI> Staple of Cloath) for its greatness of commerce. 3ly. <HI>Ditmarsh,</HI> and 4ly. <HI>Holstein,</HI> properly so called. The whole <HI>Peninsula</HI> is but 75 miles in length, and 60 in breadth, with the 2 <HI>Jutlands</HI> belonging to the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> so that this Dutchy can be reputed of little force, al∣though it consist of a great number of walled Ci∣ties and Towns, and is very populous, but the li∣berties of the said two Hanse Towns, and the <HI>Da∣nish</HI> part, retrench the estimate of its force.</P>
<P>It was over-run by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in 1643. during the residence of this King <HI>Frederick</HI> the third, as Duke thereof, to the great surprisal of old King <HI>Christiern,</HI> yet he so notably bestirred himself, with the help of the Emperour, both against them and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at Sea and Land, that he brought the business to some advantage on his side, had not the <HI>French</HI> King interposed his Authority in the very nick of a decision of it by Battel, and did the <HI>Swede</HI> a notable kindness; since when, by the marriage of the late King of <HI>Sweden</HI> with the Daughter of this present Duke, who is a lineal Descendant of <HI>John</HI> the younger, Son of <HI>Christiern</HI> the 3d. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> it hath suffered in that War from the <HI>Dane</HI> and his Confaederates what it had formerly underwent by the <HI>Swede,</HI> who to shew his Affection to his Father-in-Law, had procured him some Concessions and Assignments by the <HI>Roschild</HI> Treaty, which being afterwards violated by the <HI>Swede,</HI> this Country paid for the
<PB N="56" REF="36"/><HI>Swedes</HI> undue courtesie by the forces of the Mar∣quess of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and the Emperour; not∣withstanding in the last Treaty in the Leagure be∣fore <HI>Copenhagen</HI> it retained thus much, that the Jurisdiction of <HI>Swabstadt,</HI> together with half the Chapter of the Dutchy of <HI>Sleswick</HI> (lying in North-<HI>Jutland</HI>) together with the soveraignty thereof, was assigned and passed over to this Duke for e∣ver.</P>
<P>So that this Dukes Interest is at present bound up in that of <HI>Sweden,</HI> having countermarched its Ground, being formerly more strictly tyed to the <HI>Dane;</HI> but we see what Fate and Revolutions can do As to the <HI>Turk,</HI> being he is exempt from the Decrees and Injunctions of the Empire, it is not to be expected he will put himself forward, for that he is none of the wealthiest Princes, having not one Farthing of Customes by Sea, but only his Toll for the 50000. Oxen above mentioned, and some Patrimonial Lands belonging to the Dutchy. We are now obliged to pass to <HI>Oldenburg,</HI> because it had formerly the same Dependencies and Aspects to <HI>Denmark;</HI> but because I will not trespass too far upon <HI>Germany,</HI> we will leave it to its place there: And so we pass by Sea to <HI>Holland,</HI> and the seven United Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>NETHERLANDS:</HI> OR, The 7. Vnited Provinces OF <HI>HOLLAND,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THese Countries are bounded on the North and West with the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, on the East with part of <HI>Germany,</HI> and on the South with <HI>Flanders,</HI> &amp;c. They were once under several Lords and State-holders, who by the Power, and their Interest with the Emperours of <HI>Germany,</HI> made themselves absolute; from whom, by the Marriage of their Heirs General, they devolved at last into the Soveraignty of the Dukes of <HI>Bur∣gundy,</HI> whose Daughter conveyed them to <HI>Maxi∣milian</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria.</HI> By his Grand-Son <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. they were designed to be made with the other ten Provinces, one entire Kingdom: but the Discrepancy of their Laws and
<PB N="85" REF="37"/>Customes, and the irreconcilable Contrariety thereof, made him give over that Resolution.</P>
<P>About the Year of our Lord 1567. at what time the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> raged against all these Provinces, they shook off the <HI>Spanish</HI> Yoak, and the Govern∣ment of <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. Son of <HI>Charles</HI> the 5 th. who setling himself in his Realm of <HI>Spain,</HI> intend∣ed to govern them by a Stat-holder: That Dis∣content, together with the memory of their for∣mer Oppressions, the Insolence of their present Governours, the Contempt of their Laws and Pri∣viledges; together with the Decrees of the Coun∣cil of <HI>Trent,</HI> the revived Edict of the said <HI>Charles</HI> against Haeretiques, and the Introduction of the Inquisition; to which may be added; the hated Administration of <HI>Perennot</HI> the Cardinal of <HI>Gran∣velle,</HI> the Death of the Counts of <HI>Egmond</HI> and <HI>Horn,</HI> and the tenth and hundredth Penny, taxed by the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and his Cruelties there∣after; so animated these People, that they entred into a Confaederacy, under the Conduct of <HI>Willi∣am,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Count of <HI>Nassau,</HI> and in the year 1581. by a publique Instrument, decla∣red the said King to have rightfully fallen from the Dominion and Jurisdiction of these Provinces, then united under the Profession of the Reformed Religion, (Nevertheless, they are not yet, nor are ever like to be, an entire Common-Wealth, while each retains its Soveraignty distinct; and therefore it is a new Module of a Republique, with∣out any Pattern) <HI>viz. Guelderland, Holland, Freizland, Zeland, Zutphen,</HI> the Bishoprick of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and <HI>Groeningen.</HI></P>
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
<P>Now the Cement and Principles of these Con∣faederate States, and the Contracts by which they are Combined together, and by which they have so gloriously subsisted, come next, under a brief Consideration. The First of them is; That they shall continue inseparably united, nor shall act di∣stinctly in the common Affairs. 2. The Rights, Priviledges, and Franchises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of each parti∣cular Province, shall be continued inviolate. 3. They shall strennuously assist one another; and if any Difference arise between two Places, they shall submit to the ordinary Course of Justice; and shall attempt nothing to the prejudice of one ano∣ther. 4. They shall mutually aid and defend one another against the Armes of <HI>Spain,</HI> and shall sym∣pathize with one anothers Losses, 5. The new Fortresses shall be made at the common Charge, but the Frontiers at the particular Charge of each Province. 6. Peace, War, or Truce, not to be made without the common Consent of all the Estates and People. 7. Liberty of Conscience shall be allowed. 8. All Care shall be used by each particular Province, and all of them in gene∣ral, that they give no Cause of Quarrel or Offence, whereby they should become engaged in any other War, than that of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>These were the Originalls of this Republique, and the Fundamental Laws thereof; we will now see the Practice and Execution of them, in the Ad∣ministration, and the Policy of the Government. 1. Every City of these United Provinces, ac∣knowledges its particular Magistrate; the Provin∣cial Magistrate, and the Colledge of the Lords,
<PB N="60" REF="38"/>the States-General. By the Magistrate of the City, are understood the Councellours, whose total number is forty; (which are paid for their service, and hold their Places for life, because they may act freely, without those resentments of a future pri∣vate Condition; these deliberate of the Affairs of the Province, and inspect and choose all other Magistrates, and are in effect the Peoples Servants, as they will sometimes taunt them) the Burgo-Ma∣sters, and Sheriffs, together with a Baily, who judgeth absolutely in Criminal Causes; but he holds his Place not longer than <HI>Durante Placito,</HI> of the Council of the City.</P>
<P>The Provincial Magistracy is composed of a Councellour of every City of the Province, whose Office is to Conserve its Priviledges and Immuni∣ties; to this Court there lies an Appeal from the Sentence of the Sheriffs Court.</P>
<P>The Colledge or Assembly of the Lords States General, is constituted of the Deputies of the Pro∣vincial Councils; these make the Alliances, and Treaties, or War with foreign Princes and States; and these raise Money, and impose Taxes, and take the Care of the Peace and well-Being of the Publique. In this Assembly, one of the Assessors, or Pensionary Counsellours, opens the Matter or Affair in a proportion, which the Deputies re∣ceive, but give no answer till they have received one from the Provincial Councils, who likewise must be resolved by the respective Cities, which makes State Business very tedious, but that's re∣compensed by a good digestion, and mature deli∣beration. So that the Soveraignty resides not in
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>the Assembly of the States General, although they seem to have all the Power, but in the Estates of every Province, and the Council of the Cities. In effect, the Cities frame their particular Laws, and do their own business, without communicating it to the States General: But the States General cannot undertake any thing, without first writing to the Provinces, and obliging their Negotiation with the Cities, to obtain the permission of their Determinations.</P>
<P>The States General meet at the <HI>Hague,</HI> where every Province presides weekly; Every Province sends one or more Deputies, who all of them make but one Voice; Each Province takes Place of other in their own Territory, to preserve Aequa∣lity, and their Votes are of the same Validity: Every Province likewise Payes its own Deputies, and changeth them once in three years, to make room for others to finger the Government; but they must be such as have Desert and Estates, that they may solely intend the Publique, without De∣triment to their private Fortune.</P>
<P>The People are generally good natured to Stran∣gers, and free in their Converse one to another; their Looks very vivacious and pleasant: yet are they wondrous subtle and prudent, and love in things most excessively <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Liberty:</HI> But such the Capricies concerning the latter, that they sute that Character of <HI>Tacitus; Nec possunt Liberta∣tem, nec Servitutem pati:</HI> Or that of <HI>Strada,</HI> which comes nearest the matter; <HI>Nulli magis Servitutem execrantur, nulli melius patiuntur;</HI> They can neither endure Servitude nor Freedom: for every man will
<PB N="62" REF="39"/>take upon himself to rectifie the present Govern∣ment; and in this their Presses are very scandalous. As to the latter, the many miseries &amp; violences they have done to Trade in all Nations of the World, both by private Men, and publique Commission, have made it too notorious; and this Kingdom chiefly feeleth the Mischief thereof. And here were oc∣casion to speak of those Encroachments, both up∣on our Fishing at Home, and our Traffique Abroad, especially in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where they have in a manner engrossed all the Trade: Not to mention their Attempts upon <HI>Guinea,</HI> and their Insolen∣cies committed there. By which means, in a few years, if un-interrupted, they will gain all the Wealth in the World into their Hands; which that they drive at, is apparent by those vast Fleets they have for a good while maintained in those <HI>In∣dian</HI> Seas, and those Acquists they have made by Land there also; so that they are Formidable to all the Princes of those Parts: And it is very Credi∣ble, that the repute and dread they have gotten there, is partly obliged to a quantity of <HI>English</HI> Seamen, whom they have for some late time em∣ployed and shipped upon Voyages to those Coasts, and left them dispersed in Garrisons, contrary to Articles and Agreement made at their Embarquing; by which means they deprive us also of Seamen. But to proceed.</P>
<P>They have been declared a Free State, and the High and Mighty Lords the States General, ever since 1648. when the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> wearied with a 80. years War, was more than willing to re∣linquish his Claim, and Regal Title, (being per∣plexed
<PB N="63" REF="39"/>and engaged on the other side with the <HI>French</HI>) for that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were obstinately bent against a Peace with him: Nevertheless Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> their General, and State-holder, being induced thereunto by great Advantages to himself and Family, as well as the States, it took effect. Since which, they concerned themselves, that nei∣ther the <HI>French,</HI> nor the <HI>Spaniard</HI> grew too Po∣tent in the Low Countries; and to that purpose, maintained a good Correspondence with their new reconciled Enemy, supplying him with Mo∣ney in his Distresses, upon security of his Plate Fleet, in which they have deeply interessed them∣selves: who likewise omitted no Courtship nor Civility, to oblige them to his side.</P>
<P>Being thus absolute, and look'd upon as one of the most considerable Members of <HI>Christendom,</HI> their Ambition and Arrogance transported them to quarrel with the new usurping States of <HI>England,</HI> as their Juniors, and to try Title for the Dominion of the Sea, and all things seemed to favour the Enterprise, for the State had been in sore Trou∣bles newly before, by the Interest of the Prince of <HI>Aurange,</HI> the Husband of the Princess Royal; who perceived the Republicans began to grow weary of his Authority, by which, and the Merit of his Ancestors, they had attained to their present Greatness; but he dying soon after, all mention of those matters was laid aside, and the Common-Wealth Faction predominated every where.</P>
<P>It is true, some of those Grandees, after the ill success of the War, cunningly shifted the engaging in, and inducement to it, upon that Princes

<P>By this War, when they might have boasted of a precarious Peace, granted by them to our new Coddled States, who courted, and earnestly sought their Republican Friendship, out of fear of the joynt revenge of all the Kings of <HI>Christendom,</HI> for their late perpetrated Regicide, they were redu∣ced to a very low Ebbe; and they may thank the Protectoral Revolution, that they were not left dry, and exhausted, and the Sea wholly debarred from them, but what they sayled by our permission. Nor was the Death of their Renowned Admiral <HI>Van Trump,</HI> one of the least of their Losses, as they publiquely exprest; and I think I shall grati∣fie the Reader, if I present him him with a Copy of his Epitaph, inscribed on his stately Monument at <HI>Delfe,</HI> being a Person so much celebrated in e∣very mans discourse.</P>

<P>With this gallant Persons Death, the <HI>Dutch</HI> reso∣lution of Fighting changed into milder &amp; humbler thoughts: but sad was the face of this Country, upon the return of their Fleet, so maimed and un∣manned; nor did they forbear to deplore this la∣mentable loss, and to demand openly a sudden Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> with whom if they were Friends, they would defie the World: And now their Governours were blamed, for commencing such a destructive Enterprise, (and the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, and others, highly carressed, who some while before had changed &amp; transferred their Staple from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> to <HI>Dort</HI>) and they terribly threatned, if it were not quickly set an end to, and composed, by any manner of Agreement: And yet as soon as it was concluded, they fell pre∣sently
<PB N="66" REF="42"/>to their old Depraedations in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and have continued them there, and elsewhere, ever since. So natural it is for these People to take all advantages for gain; and such the dilatory proceed∣ings of their Courts of Justice, and removal from one Chamber of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company (which are six in all, <HI>viz.</HI> Of <HI>Amsterdam, Delf, Rotterdam, Middleburgh,</HI> &amp;c.) to another, that it is a worse vexation to prosecute the recovery, than is the loss of our Goods; as might be instanced in the Case of those interessed in Squire <HI>Courtens</HI> Ships; (who lost not only the Ships and Goods, but his Factories also, the best and richest in all the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> and ever since 1643. possessed by that means by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for that Squire <HI>Courten</HI> was thereby wholly deprived of any means to supply them) and this one thing hath proved as great a Damage to the <HI>English</HI> Nation, as any Action of theirs since <HI>Amboyna.</HI></P>
<P>We have been thus liberal in discoursing of their Trade, because it is the Soul, nay, the best part of the Body of this little vast Republique; and is the only considerable thing: For alass, what are those puny Provinces they till and manure, and make Pasture of, (and much of that torn from their better Parent the Sea) to be compared with those vast Regions they possess abroad? So that <HI>Holland</HI> seems to be the Hive; but the sweet Flowers from whence the Honey is gathered, and with which they sustain themselves, are planted in more blessed Countries. It hath been said, and it is true, that the Bank of <HI>Venice</HI> gives Law and Rule to the Exchange of Money in <HI>Europe:</HI> and
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>hereafter it may be said, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade go on thus, it will give Law to all Trade through∣out the World, if it presume not also to the Sword.</P>
<P>And as they are thus careful and industrious for their profit and glory in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where they aspire to an universal Soveraignty, and have already intitled themselves to the Southern Seas: so do they as diligently mind their near Concern in the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea, and the Trade about the North∣ern Cape to <HI>Russia,</HI> of which we had experience in their stickling so between the two Northern Kings, And although they were adventrously engaged in that Business by the <HI>Brandenburger,</HI> their old Con∣faederate and Ally by the House of <HI>Orange,</HI> who afterwards left them to their own Councils: yet did they at last come off handsomely with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> by the Treaty of <HI>Elbing</HI> 1657. though with great loss of Money; and afterwards more gloriously with him, when, by their assistance gi∣ven the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> 1659. they made the <HI>Swede</HI> to understand, that He could not be Master of the <HI>Sound</HI> without their leave. As for the Em∣perour of <HI>Russia,</HI> they carry fair with him, and cheat him sufficiently, but yet they find good re∣spect from him, and a kind Correspondence; so that he will be no Enemy to them, unless upon an <HI>English</HI> account, which he highly prefers.</P>
<P>And incredible is the Profit which ariseth by their Trade out of those Countries by Corn, (which they disperse into <HI>Europe</HI>) Hemp, Tarr, Cordage, Masts, Deal-boards, Clap-boards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they have in Exchange for their Spices from
<PB N="68" REF="43"/><HI>India;</HI> so that 600. Sayl have gone together out of the <HI>Texel</HI> for the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea: Nor is their Herring Fishing less considerable, of which they make three Millions Sterling yearly, and of Cod∣fish little less, beside their Whale Fishing; so that they do not trade and barter for less than forty Mil∣lions yearly. Now to encourage People to settle themselves with them, and to carry on their Na∣vigation: they give great and equal Priviledges to all Commers; nor are the Duties upon Goods Ex∣ported or Imported, any way so considerable as in other Kingdomes: Besides, they will not suffer any Corporations, or the Enclosure of any Trade, but it shall be free for all men, either to Voyage whither they please, or to adventure their Money on the joynt Stock, that menageth that Employ∣ment, without any distinction or difference what∣soever; which courses, with their Toleration of all Religions, have made them so thrive in this manner, and to be so Populous as they are at this day.</P>
<P>We come now to speak of their Forces, and their present Posture, which is chiefly Naval, as may be concluded from the fore-going discourse; and that Naval Power supposed to be greater and better now than e're it was, so that they can arm and man 200. Ships of War built for service in a very short time, and upon a sudden alarum, but we will leave that to time. Certainly they are well provided, but it is as much certain, they care not for a War, especially with the <HI>Englsh,</HI> it being so contrary to their Interest, that every Cabbin Boy will not endure to hear of it. He that reads their
<PB N="69" REF="43"/>Books Printed upon this subject, will perceive as much, together, with what fine Artifices they have contrived to flur their Misdemeanours, and compound them under-hand by Friends; and this is avowedly laid down, as a method to Satisfaction beyond all Comparison: And then their Tempori∣zing, and peremptory Promises, is another Shift, which may chance to help them to better Oppor∣tunities. At this present they assure the King of giving him Content, and have promised him to call a General Assembly of the Estates to that pur∣pose: And by an express Envoy, have intreated his Majesty, to take off the Quarantayn or Demoorage upon their Ships, by reason of the Plague; but there's more stiffness in the wind.</P>
<P>As to their Land Forces, they alwayes keep up a standing Militia, both for fear of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> their near Neighbour, and for all Emergencies at home; but of late they have reduced it to a less number than formerly; notwithstanding, it is suf∣ficient for Defence, and for any sudden Employ∣ment; and if they want upon any Rupture, their Money will raise them Souldiers: but the great Armies they maintained under the Princes of <HI>Au∣range,</HI> for the gaining of one Town in a Summer, makes 'um now very parsimonious.</P>
<P>They are now in firm League both with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and all the other Princes of <HI>Christen∣dom,</HI> (excepting some Piques in <HI>East-Friezland,</HI> about the <HI>Eyler Sconce,</HI> with the Earl thereof, which Prince <HI>William,</HI> by their order, besieged, and had it yielded, during a Treaty above) so that they have leisure (if they mean to be honest with Us)
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>to revenge themselves of the <HI>Algier</HI> Pirates, who have done them most despiteful outrages: and to supply the Emperour with some assistance by Land, which is the Consideration of this Discourse.</P>
<P>And indeed, there are no People so engaged to assist against this Enemy, as these, especially by Sea, where they themselves have made them thus powerful to do mischief, by yielding their Ships to them without striking one blow, (which, by the <HI>Turkish</HI> Custom, gives Liberty to the Mar∣riners, upon such innocent and speedy rendition) which Ships have formerly served for the Piratical Trade, till with those they took better of theirs, and so framed their Modules. They have now a Fleet, under <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> preparing to set sail for <HI>Algier,</HI> but upon no other account, than to re∣press their Insolencies; not intending to give any offence to the <HI>Grand Seigniour,</HI> whose Coasts and Maritime Places, a Conjunction of the Christian Fleets now hovering in the Streights, would quick∣ly reduce, and do him thereby a great deal of mis∣chief, if the War were prosecuted; otherwise it we e labour and time lost. As for Land service, they have the same convenient passage for them to <HI>Hungary,</HI> as the Princes and Provinces of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> if they were free, and open-hearted, in this time of danger; but it is to be feared, the Emperours Ambassadour will not have his answer from them in any reasonable time, or that it will no prove satisfactory and effectual, for they have little inclinations to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> unless the Case prove very dangerous, and threaten them nearer: And there is a Saying of a former <HI>Grand
<PB N="71" REF="44"/>Siegniour; That if they should have provoked him, as they did their Soveraign the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>he would have sent Fellows with Shovels, and have thrown that little Marish into the Sea.</HI> Of late they have driven a great Trade in his Countries, till very now, and the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> (by which our Cloaths are risen there to good price and esti∣mation) and do all they can to maintain a good in∣telligence at the Port; where, and in other Pla∣ces, they enjoy the Priviledge of Ambassadours or Consuls. I would not omit, that they have been long and much pressed by the <HI>French,</HI> and Catho∣lique King, and sometimes by our Soveraign, at the instance of the <HI>Grand Master,</HI> and Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> to make Restitution to that Order, of some Lands they enjoy and possess of theirs, in the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> but they take it unkindly, to be urged to such stale Demands and Pretensions.</P>
<P>The Interest of <HI>Holland</HI> is considerable in a dou∣ble respect, either to Land or Sea. As to the Land, they are obliged to look to their Frontires, and maintain their Places of Strength, as those that will secure them best, it having been proved by experience, that one Leagure hath destroyed whole Armies. They are likewise concerned to keep their Common-Wealth free from the Di∣sturbances that may arise by the Estates of some petty Soveraignties, that are within their Pre∣cincts, and out of their Jurisdiction, for fear of Potent Interests in the Quarrel, from their Neigh∣bours, and therefore to suppress them with all speed: Of this nature there are some Places be∣longing to the Earl of <HI>East-Friezland,</HI> some to the
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> as the <HI>Eyler Sconce,</HI> about which the present Troubles are arisen, by the In∣juries of that Garrison, as is pretended; and the Earldom of <HI>Culenburg</HI> in <HI>Guelderland,</HI> (the Coun∣ty of <HI>Buren,</HI> the fair Patrimony of the Prince of <HI>Aurange,</HI> in the same Province) separated from the Dutchy of <HI>Guelderland,</HI> and so dignified by King <HI>Philp</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had respect to the entire and rich Situation thereof, with its Do∣minions and Appurtenances. This Earl is likewise in a readiness to be embroyled with the <HI>Hollander</HI> about the same score, and its Credible he hath Par∣ties to back him. They are also more nearly inte∣ressed, that the <HI>French,</HI> nor no other Potent Prince, get any further footing in <HI>Flanders,</HI> upon the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who is the best, and most ad∣vantagious Neighbour they can have. They must keep fair with the Prince of <HI>Aurange,</HI> and abridge him of no Rights his Predecessors enjoyed; but of his Concerns we shall speak more particularly in the Original of his Family in <HI>Germany.</HI> An even and equal hand must be carried between the <HI>Swede</HI> and the <HI>Dane;</HI> and they must have good Friends in <HI>Germany,</HI> of which <HI>Brandenburg</HI> will alwayes be one, and most of the <HI>Calvinian</HI> Princes, whom they keep at their Devotion with some small Offi∣ces or Kindnesses done them.</P>
<P>As to the Sea, there is a necessity of a firm Cor∣respondence with the <HI>Hanse</HI> Towns, not in point of Commerce, for they grudge them any society in it, but out of security to their own, in Case of a Rupture; for by their entitling themselves to <HI>Lubeck</HI> and <HI>Hamburg,</HI> and the like Places, in
<PB N="73" REF="45"/>the late War between them and Us, they cheated Us of many considerable Prizes, which were own∣ed by those Cities. As to the <HI>French,</HI> they must be likewise firmly Leagued, for the benefit of their Ports, and the protection of their Shore, if they gain not something else of that King in Case of War. As to the <HI>Portugal,</HI> they must, as Cases go, suffer him to go away with his Conquests in <HI>Brasile,</HI> whatever amends they make themselves in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> by their late taking of some Places there, and the further progress of their Armes in those Parts; but it is supposed, they have some as∣pect upon the same <HI>Brasile.</HI> As to the <HI>Turk,</HI> suffi∣cient hath been spoken concerning them in the Premisses.</P>
<P>I should have described the Situation, but it be∣ing so near a Neighbour to Us, I suppose it un∣necessary; all therefore that I shall adde, is, that it is conveniently and commodiously seated for Trade with all the Provinces of <HI>Europe,</HI> either by Land or Sea. For the Air, it is indifferent, according to the Season of the Year: And so we pass to the other ten Provinces, under the Jurisdiction to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>BRABANT</HI> &amp; <HI>FLANDERS:</HI> OR THE Ten Provinces of the <HI>Ne∣therlands,</HI> under the Do∣minion of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Names of these Provinces, are, First, <HI>Brabant, Flanders, Limburgh, Lutzem∣burgh, Namur, Zutphen,</HI> the Marquisat of the Sacred Empire, <HI>Mechlin, Henault,</HI> and <HI>Artois;</HI> of the two latter whereof, the King of <HI>France</HI> is near possessed; as of some Towns in the Country of <HI>Flanders,</HI> of which more at large. For the Situa∣tion of them, it is so different, in respect of eve∣ry particular Province, and so well known to our Nation, that I will not stand to describe it. The Country is generally very pleasant, and far exceeds the 7. United Provinces for Corn, Grain, and production of Cattel; and affords all manner of good Diet, in a plenteous manner; and a very
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>wholesome Air to digest it. <HI>Brabant</HI> is the first in our way, although the States General do share in the two first Stages thereof (and some other Towns, as <HI>Hertogenbush,</HI> &amp;c.) namely <HI>Breda,</HI> the Dominion and Jurisdiction of the Prince of <HI>Aurange,</HI> and <HI>Bergenapzom;</HI> and that they had not <HI>Antwerp</HI> was their own fault, when underta∣ken by Prince <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Aurange</HI> in 1648. (assi∣sted thereto by 6000. <HI>French</HI> Horse and Foot, sent them by the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ge∣neralissimo, then besieging <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> to his great dis-advantage, for want of the said men, to carry on the Siege of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>) but given over by him at the order of the States, and the instance of those of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> who fore-saw that that Town would carry away the Trade from them, and de∣prive <HI>Holland</HI> of that Wealth and Glory she had so long enjoyed in the Traffique of that her grand Emporium. And indeed it is one of the finest Places in the World, famous for its Exchange, from whence ours was patterned, and that general re∣sort made it so some a 100. years agoe from all Parts of the World, when <HI>Amsterdam</HI> was in its Infan∣cy, and might never have risen to any grown Estate, but for the War with <HI>Spain,</HI> which eclip∣sed the lustre of this Mistriss of all Negotiation, and pent her up in the Shallows of the River <HI>Scheld,</HI> (hard by the Sea Port Towns of <HI>Middle-borough</HI> and <HI>Flushing,</HI> and the Block-house of <HI>Lillo</HI>) which had had all the Deeps flowing in upon her with the Treasures of the World. And in this Condition she yet remaines, an Impost being still paid to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for all Goods passing from
<PB N="76" REF="47"/><HI>Flushing,</HI> by <HI>Lillo,</HI> and so thither: It continueth nevertheless the residence of many wealthy <HI>English</HI> Merchants, (and of all Nations besides) who live there in great splendour, and are highly re∣spected by the civil Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Government being Monarchical, with the Intervention of the Estates of the Country, to ad∣vise upon occasions, and the raising of Moneys, it will be unnecessary to give a further account thereof, because common, and the same with all Regal Administration, save that this is not so abso∣lute as other Soveraignties; for although the House of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> by a standing Militia, raised at first (and paid by the consent of the Estates) for the Honour and Majesty of their Persons, which they increased afterwards at their pleasure to a for∣midable number of <HI>Gens d' Armes,</HI> did keep them very low; and the House of <HI>Austria</HI> (into whose Patrimony this Princely Estate fell, with the Mar∣riage of the sole Daughter of <HI>Burgundy</HI> to the Arch-Duke <HI>Maximilian</HI>) endeavoured to subju∣gate them totally by the same and other Means and Policies; upon which followed many terrible Revolts, particularly that of <HI>Ghendt:</HI> yet could they not be brought to abandon their Pretensions to Liberty, the Terms and Name whereof they held as precious Reliques, and would boldly talk of them, though to no effect. But when the <HI>Hol∣landers,</HI> by their valiant strugling, had shook the Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> and as good as shook off that Yoak; that King found it high time to carry a gen∣tle sweet hand over those Provinces that remained in his Subjection, and their Allegiance, and gave
<PB N="77" REF="47"/>them that <HI>Gratis,</HI> which the other had extorted, although not to that full Liberty, yet as much as satisfied this People; who being addicted to the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, (which was the main Grievance of the Revolters) and eased in point of Taxes, were content with their old Master; being natu∣rally of a more tractable and ducible temper, than the stiffe and storm-driven <HI>Hollander,</HI> who could never compose or quiet his thoughts after the first rupture.</P>
<P>And indeed, had not these People been fast and sure in Allegiance, which was sweetned to them by many Acts of Grace, this King had never been able to have withstood such Potent Enemies, as for 12. years together, from 1636. to 1648. set upon him on both sides; notwithstanding, in which year, or somewhat sooner, without doubt he had been driven out of this Country, betwixt the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the Prey shared betwixt them; but that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were more jea∣lous of the <HI>French,</HI> as a potenter and nearer Neighbour, whose entire strength might at one time be powred in upon them: So, that although they made a show of pursuing their Confaederacy in 1646. and so to 48. yet in the mean while, not∣withstanding all the <HI>French</HI> Instances to the con∣trary by Mounsieur <HI>Servient</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> they secretly proceeded to an Agreement with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and finally concluded it at <HI>Munster</HI> a∣foresaid. By which means, the more Northernly and Westernly Provinces, as <HI>Brabant, Namur,</HI> &amp;c. had a discharged respite from the harass of War, but the Easternly and Southerly suffered as much as e∣ver from the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<PB N="78" REF="48"/>
<P>Nevertheless the King of <HI>Spain</HI> made shift to make his Party good against the <HI>French</HI> alone, gain∣ing one Summer what he lost in another; until <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> upon account of Partnership, joyned with the <HI>French,</HI> and turned the Ballance; wherefore the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had begun a Treaty, and debated most of the Particulars, in the year 1656. at <HI>Madrid,</HI> earnestly resumed it in the Summer 1659. at St. <HI>John de Luz,</HI> in the Confines of both Kingdomes of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> by the Plempotentiaries of the two Crowns, Car∣dinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> who in <HI>November</HI> concluded it, and made this Agreement, as to these Provinces, which were assigned to the Crown of <HI>France</HI> for ever; Namely, the County of <HI>Artois,</HI> with the Town and City of <HI>Arras; Hesden,</HI> and the Liberties thereof; <HI>Bethune,</HI> with its Jurisdiction; <HI>Bapaume, Lents, Lillers, Ter∣roane, de Pas,</HI> with the Liberties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with the Count of St. <HI>Pol.</HI> Excepting the Towns and Jurisdictions of <HI>Ayre,</HI> and St. <HI>Omer.</HI> With the Town of <HI>Renty,</HI> as belonging to either of those two Places. Within the Province and County of <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Towns of <HI>Graveling,</HI> the Forts, <HI>Philip, Sluce, Hanouin,</HI> and <HI>Bourbourg,</HI> toge∣ther with St. <HI>Venant.</HI> (Since which time the <HI>French</HI> are likewise possessed of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Mar∣dike</HI> Fort) Within the County of <HI>Hanault,</HI> of the Towns of <HI>Landrecy</HI> and <HI>Quesnoy,</HI> the Ducal Title of Marshal <HI>Turenne,</HI> with all their Jurisdicti∣ons and Appurtenances. Within the Province of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> with the Towns of <HI>Theonville, Mont∣medy,</HI> and <HI>Damvilliers,</HI> with their Dependen∣cies;
<PB N="79" REF="48"/>the Government of <HI>Ivoy, Chavanty,</HI> and <HI>Marville,</HI> as belonging partly to the Dutchy of <HI>Bar.</HI></P>
<P>In lieu whereof, the <HI>French</HI> King exchanged the Towns of <HI>La-Bassee,</HI> and <HI>Bergen,</HI> St. <HI>Wynox,</HI> with the <HI>Fort Royal,</HI> built upon the Channel, in the way to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> for the Places of <HI>Marienburg,</HI> and <HI>Philippe ville,</HI> seated betwixt the Rivers <HI>Sam∣bre,</HI> and the <HI>Maes;</HI> together with <HI>Avennes,</HI> seat∣ed upon the same Rivers: And as to other Places, taken by the Armes of <HI>France,</HI> in these Countries, the <HI>French</HI> re-delivered the Towns of <HI>Ypres, Oude∣naerd, Dixmude, Furnes,</HI> with the Forts of <HI>La Fintelle, La Quenoque, Merville,</HI> upon the River <HI>Lys, Menene,</HI> and <HI>Comines,</HI> with the Forts of St. <HI>Amour, Bleverans,</HI> and <HI>Joux;</HI> the Towns of <HI>Rocroy, Catelet,</HI> and <HI>Linchamp;</HI> which is a small Restitution for the Acquists the <HI>French</HI> have made by this Treaty.</P>
<P>As to the Forces of these Provinces, it is, and hath appeared to be very redoubted; the <HI>Walloons</HI> being excellent Souldiers, both for Horse and Foot, as they have approved themselves, both at Home and Abroad: nor are they less numerous; besides, the Gentry are very ready to the service of their Prince and Country. (and are most accom∣plish'd Persons, speaking promptly six or seven Languages, of which, <HI>Latine</HI> very readily; but this reputed to the continuance of the War, which brought a Conflux of all Nations into those Parts) As to maritime Affairs, their <HI>Dunkirk</HI> Navigati∣ons sufficiently tell the World what they were able to do at Sea; but now they have but two Port
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>Towns, <HI>Newport</HI> and <HI>Ostend,</HI> and neither of a convenient Station or Harbour for Shipping, be∣ing very narrow and difficult to come out of with some Winds; notwithstanding, they will serve well enough for Pyratical Conveniencies, but to Fleets let <HI>Flanders</HI> bid adieu.</P>
<P>The Revenue of these Provinces was considera∣ble, were it not for the constant Charge which the King is at in maintaining them; so that they have been said to be the Correlative of the <HI>West In∣dies,</HI> during the late Wars, when they spent and consumed all that Treasure, and bankrupted the King of <HI>Spain</HI> besides; And sure it will be a long time, and there must be as long a Tract of Peace, before their Incomes will ballance the Account, and make the King of <HI>Spain</HI> a Saver: However, at present he is in hopes of being no further Loser, and of reducing his Revenue to some settlement, which the late times so perplexed and squandered; and the Care and Frugality of the present Gover∣nour, the Marquess <HI>Caracence,</HI> hath made a fair progress therein already. In former times these People would not be content without a Prince of the Blood to be their Governour, which made King <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> send his Daughter <HI>Isabella Clara,</HI> and afterwards invested her, and her Hus∣band <HI>Albert</HI> the Arch-Duke, with the Soveraign∣ty; and since the Cardinal <HI>Infanta,</HI> the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold,</HI> and <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria:</HI> but such is the present acquiescence under this fair and ami∣cable Government of the Marquess; besides, such is the paucity of the Princes of the Blood, both of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Austria.</HI> that they willingly accept of
<PB N="81" REF="49"/>soever the King sends; but such is his aequality and evenness with the People, that the States are in∣terested in the Administration more than ever any Prince would in former times allow; but now they are grown up into a mutual Confidence, and right Understanding one of another. The Marquess of <HI>Caracena</HI> is supposed to be upon his departure, and the Marquess <HI>Castel Rodengo</HI> is appointed to succeed him.</P>
<P>As to their Interest, it being conjoyned, and depending upon that of <HI>Spain,</HI> further than what the Ecclesiasticks will do voluntarily of themselves, in this Grand Cause of Religion, against the <HI>Turks:</HI> Besides that, this People, and Clergy especially, are mainly devoted to the Imperial Fa∣mily; we will consider it when we come to treat of the Kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

<P>The whole Land of <HI>France</HI> is fruitful and fertile, and though the <HI>Apennine</HI> Hills, spreading over al∣most all the South of <HI>Italy,</HI> are barren, yet in the Mountains of <HI>Auvergue</HI> (which are the only of note, and few else in <HI>France</HI>) stand many good Towns, richly seated, where Cloathing is exer∣cuted, and a good part of the Kingdom served with Butter and Flesh of excellent relish; the rest of the Kingdom is almost plain, here and there garnished with fruitful Hills, and green Valleys, whose plenty doth contend with variety, fertility, with delicacy, commodiousness of situation, with the beautiful Fabricks and Structures of Cities. And herein, without controversie, <HI>Italy</HI> giveth place to <HI>France;</HI> for although some one Corner thereof affordeth exquisite Pleasure, and delight∣ful Prospects, with happy Conveniences of Situa∣tion, as <HI>Rovera d' Sala, Campania,</HI> the Terri∣tory of <HI>Croton, Tarent,</HI> and some other Cities of <HI>Calabria:</HI> yet those are singular, and few in <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> common and frequent in <HI>Fra ce;</HI> especially in <HI>Burgundy, Brie,</HI> the Isle of <HI>France, Turen, Anjou, Xaintong,</HI> and <HI>Languedoc:</HI> In each of which Provinces, it seemeth that Nature hath set apart, and as it were dedicated by allotment, some Places to <HI>Ceres,</HI> some to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> some to <HI>Pomona,</HI> and some to <HI>Pallas;</HI> Yea, it happeneth very often, that the Western or North-west Wind arising from the Sea, bringeth the Spring-tide
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>before the Winter be fully expired, so decking the Fields with Flowers, and the Gardens with Herbs, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Poitou, Bourde∣aux,</HI> the Isle of <HI>France,</HI> &amp;c. enjoy as forward a Spring, as those of <HI>Jago d' Garda</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> which is reckoned one of the most praecoce Fruta∣ges in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But there is nothing in <HI>France</HI> more worthy the noting, than the number and pleasure of the Na∣vigable Rivers, whereof some as it were gird in the whole Realm, as <HI>Sagona, Rhosne,</HI> and <HI>Mo∣sel;</HI> some other cut through the middle, as the <HI>Sequan</HI> or <HI>Seyn, Layre,</HI> and <HI>Garon;</HI> Into these Streams fall so many other Rivers, some from the utmost bounds, some from the inmost Parts of the Realm, that it maketh the whole Country commodious for Traffique and Exchange of each o∣thers Wants: Insomuch, that by this facility of carriage, and intercourse of Merchants, all things may be said to be in common to the whole King∣dom. In <HI>Anjou</HI> alone are forty Rivers, great and small, whereupon Q. <HI>Katherin de Medicis</HI> was wont to say; <HI>That this Kingdom contained more Ri∣vers, than all</HI> Europe <HI>besides:</HI> This indeed was an Hyperbolical Speech, yet something of affinity to truth. And we see, that this easie and ready con∣veyance, with the goodness and luxuriance of the Soyl, hath been the original of so many great Ci∣ties, and good Towns, in this Kingdom, and those most commonly seated upon the Banks of Ri∣vers. And although it have many goodly Havens, yet the Up-land Towns are fairer and richer than those that stand near the Sea, <HI>Marseilles</HI> excepted;
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>which argueth their wealth to be their own, and not brought from foreign Countries; for there the Sea Towns excell those of the Land, as <HI>Genoa, Ve∣nice, Ragula:</HI> but where the prosperity of Cities dependeth wholly upon the Land, there it is o∣therwise, as in <HI>Millain, Nurenberg,</HI> and most of the Towns of <HI>Germany, Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Hungary.</HI> All this notwithstanding, although almost like goodness of Soyl be proper to the whole Realm of <HI>France,</HI> as likewise the situation of the Rivers commodious; yet, <HI>Paris</HI> excepted, (whose largeness proceedeth from the Kings Court, the Parliament, and the University) the Towns there are for the most part but small and mean, yet beautiful, commodious, and very populous; so that, in a Description of the Number of this Peo∣ple, written in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the 9th. it is asserted, that the Number of the Inhabitants ex∣ceeded 15. Millions.</P>
<P>And as the Cities and Towns in <HI>France</HI> may boast of their Rivers, so the Castles and Villages of Noblemen are no less pleasured and favoured with the pleasure and strength of Lakes and Ma∣rishes; which, although they may not be compa∣red to those of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Switzerland:</HI> yet are they so many, and so fall of excellent Fish, that the numbers of the one may aequal the largeness of the other. The same may be spoken of Woods, not so well as thick grown, out of those Woods in times past the Kings Revenue did arise, and the Noblemen do make great profit, by selling great quantities thereof for fire-wood; but greater by sales of Timber Trees, which they use, for want
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>of Stone, in the greatest part of their Buil∣dings.</P>
<P>In regard of the commodious situation and cur∣rent of these Rivers, serving so fitly for the trans∣portation of Victuals from one place to another, this Kingdom is so abundantly furnished with all plenty of Provision, that it is able to nourish an Army in the Field, how multitudinous soever. When <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. entred <HI>France,</HI> first by <HI>Provence,</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Champaign,</HI> it main∣tained One hundred and fifty thousand Souldiers, besides the ord nary Garrisons. In the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the 9th. (and since that, in the time of the League, a greater number) there were main∣tained in this Kingdom 20000. Horse, 30000. Footmen Strangers, and of <HI>French</HI> 25000. Horse, and 100000. Foot.</P>
<P>Besides this plenty, there is enough to spare, being four wayes or Loadstones to draw Riches from foreign Nations 1. Corn, carried into <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugall.</HI> 2. Wines, transported into <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and the Inhabitants of the <HI>Baltique</HI> Sea. Together with Salt, wherewith the whole Kingdom, and the bordering Nations are plentifully stored. This Salt s made in <HI>Provence,</HI> of the salt water of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea; and at <HI>Brouage</HI> in <HI>Xaintong,</HI> where the heat of the Sun ceaseth his vertue of making, getting, and boyling Salt of Sea water, not daring to yield so great a favour any farther Northward; I mean of Sea water, because fur∣ther North there is Salt found also, but made ei∣ther of some special Spring water, as in <HI>Lorrain;</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="52"/>or compound of some Mineralls, mix'd with fresh waters, as in <HI>Poland, England, Germany;</HI> or else taken forth of some Salt Mines, as were once in <HI>Sweveland;</HI> but of this Merchandise of Salt, something more shall be said hereafter. The 4. and last Commodity, is Canvass, and Linnen Cloth, whereof what profit ariseth is hardly cre∣dible to those who have not made an inspection in∣to it; what abundance thereof is carried into <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> also, to make Sayls for the furnishing of Shipping? There groweth also Woad, Saffron, and other Mer∣chandise of smaller value; which, though they arise not to aequalize the above-said Commodities, yet they arise to a competent summ; so that the Emperour <HI>Maximillian</HI> used to say; <HI>That</HI> France <HI>was a continual flourishing Medow, which the King did mow as oft as he listed.</HI> And Foreigners, from the mouth of <HI>Maximillian</HI> the Emperour, who Charactered the several Princes and Subjects of <HI>Europe,</HI> call him, <HI>Rex asinorum,</HI> for the conti∣nual Burdens and Pressures he layes upon his Peo∣ple; so that in <HI>Normandy</HI> the Peasants wear wood∣en Shooes, and neither eat nor drink, Flesh, Wine, or Beer, throughout the year.</P>
<P>Having intimated before that we should not tra∣vel this Country, for that it is so generally known; we will survey only those places that are of mo∣dern concernment: Omitting therefore the names of some eminent places, which have given title to the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Valois, Bourbon,</HI> which aspect the History, but are far deducible, and supposed to be generally known; (here also, to
<PB N="88" REF="53"/>pass by the <HI>Sabique</HI> Law, which admits no female to a Scepter; under pretence whereof our <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the 3d. was put from his title to <HI>France,</HI> by <HI>Philip</HI> the first King of the House of <HI>Valois</HI>) we will mention only three places, which of all the Members and Provinces of <HI>France</HI> keep themselves yet distinct and absolute Soveraignties, notwith∣standing that the <HI>French</HI> Kings in all times endea∣voured the Union of the like parcels to the Crown; witness the Dutchy of <HI>Britany,</HI> of some late Ages; and now the Principality of <HI>Aurange,</HI> the County of <HI>Venascine,</HI> or the Papal Jurisdiction of <HI>Avignon;</HI> and lastly, the Dutchy of <HI>Nivernois,</HI> all which are totally exempt from any dependance on the Crown.</P>
<P>The Principality of <HI>Orange</HI> did belong to the County of <HI>Provence,</HI> as did <HI>Avignion,</HI> being Tributaries thereto, and made 2 parts of 3; the other being for many years in the Kings possession, by the resignation of the last Earl of <HI>Provence,</HI> who died issue-less, and is governed by a Parliament held at <HI>Aix.</HI> This Principality was once in the Possession of the noble family of <HI>Chaalons,</HI> who had it in marriage with an Heir General, and ob∣tained the absolute Soveraignty thereof from the Earl of <HI>Province;</HI> with the Priviledge of Coyning, and all other Royalties added to the Title of Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> by the Grace of God. To this Family succeeded the House of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> by their marri∣age of the Heir General likewise, about the year 1500. in which House it hath ever since conti∣nued without any disturbance, until the year 1660. In the beginning whereof, the Cardinal
<PB N="89" REF="53"/><HI>Mazarine</HI> seeing the Restitution of our Govern∣ment, resolved to seize it into the <HI>French</HI> Kings hands, before any stop might be put to his pro∣ceedings by our Kings Intervention, and accor∣dingly by menaces to the Count of <HI>Dhona</HI> the Go∣vernour, and other artifices (upon pretence of misdemeanours and outrages committed by those Protestant People upon their Catholique Neigh∣bours, to the endangering the Peace) by a Trea∣ty managed by Monsieur <HI>Jure Millet,</HI> the Kings Commissioner, possessed himself of the Town, Castle, and Principality, upon Condition to ren∣der it, with all the stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Prince at his Majority, or in case of his decease to the Family of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> but what the performance will be, is not determinable, though he hath not scru∣pled to detain the like intrusive Guardianships in lesser places, as we have mentioned in <HI>Wittenberg</HI> and <HI>Alsatia.</HI> As to the Revenue of this Principa∣lity, it is computed worth some 35000 Crowns a year, amounting to 10000 sterling; but the force of this Province no way available, for that it is every way encompassed with <HI>French</HI> Provin∣ces, and <HI>Avignion;</HI> so that in effect it is a distinct Soveraignty but as long as that King pleaseth.</P>
<P>Concerning the County of <HI>Avignion,</HI> It is seated to the Southward of <HI>Orange,</HI> and border∣eth upon the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> as Neighbouring <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and was given in fee to the Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> (who had a right of Possession before, and had also had an actual Possession for some time) by Queen <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> the rightfull Proprietor of this whole County of <HI>Province,</HI> for the defence
<PB N="90" REF="54"/>and assistance she had from <HI>Clement</HI> the 5th. in re∣stating her in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> whence she had been expelled by <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Hungary</HI> for her murtherous hanging of his Brother <HI>Andrew</HI> her Husband. Not long after, the same Pope re∣moved the Papal Chair thither, where it continu∣ed for 20 years, while <HI>Italy</HI> was grown into so many factions, and the <HI>Romans</HI> and they so dis∣gusted against the Pope, that Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> found it high time to return in the year 1377. since when it hath been governed by Vice-Legates, till the year 1663. when the King of <HI>France</HI> took possession of it, the manner whereof having been already published, 'twill be superfluous here to repeat.</P>
<P>But the Difference between the Pope and the <HI>French</HI> King concerning the affront given the Duke of <HI>Creque</HI> his Ambassadour at <HI>Rome</HI> being compos∣ed and reconciled by the agreement at <HI>Pisa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But the <HI>French</HI> King hath a Gover∣nour there yet.</NOTE> the said Town and County, by vertue thereof, was forthwith returned into the Popes hands, as the <HI>French</HI> found it, and there it remains.</P>
<P>The Dutchy of <HI>NEVERS</HI> or <HI>NEVER∣NOIS</HI> hath beyond memory continued abso∣lute, though in several Families, although it be the smallest Province in <HI>France,</HI> not to deduce the Princes or Dukes thereof from long antiquity, we will look no longer than the last Century, when in 1563. <HI>Henrietta</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Fran∣cis</HI> the 4th. and Sister to <HI>Francis</HI> the 5th. the last Duke hereof, being the Heir General to this Estate, married with <HI>Lewis,</HI> second Son of <HI>Frede∣rick Genzaga,</HI> Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> who; in her
<PB N="91" REF="54"/>right was invested in this Estate, their Son <HI>Charles</HI> chose to succeed in <HI>Nevers,</HI> and gave <HI>Mantua</HI> to his Cosen German <HI>Vincent,</HI> whose Line failing, it reverted to this House of <HI>Nevers,</HI> placed there by the potent Armes of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13th. although then busied in several other Wars, so that both Dutchyes were now united, untill of very late, Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> to instate his Family in the Splendour of <HI>France,</HI> purchased <HI>Nevers</HI> for his Nephew <HI>Mancini,</HI> at a very considerable rate, the Particulars whereof are extant in that Cardi∣nals Will, lately Englished by my self, to which the curious Reader is referred.</P>
<P>In the same Soveraign condition stood <HI>Bearn,</HI> till the time of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13th. (an Estate governed distinctly by <HI>H.</HI> 4. their Soveraign, as united to the Crown of <HI>Navarre</HI> some Descents before) who, with his Armes, and his Presence, reduced them under his Obedience: and imposed a Parliament up∣on them of his own Nomination, whose Residence is at <HI>Pau,</HI> leaving them notwithstanding the exer∣cise of their Religion, as he did all the Protestant Towns, and Cautionary Places, <HI>viz. Rochel, Mon∣talban, Saincterre,</HI> &amp;c. who, since their <HI>Cal∣vinists</HI> Armes have been taken from them, and their Forts dismantled, enjoy their Conscience a great deal more securely, and as priviledgely from the King, as when they took upon them the quali∣ty of Free States, and would all have been Sister <HI>Genevas.</HI></P>
<P>We have next to consider the Revenue of this mighty Monarchy, mighty for its Populousness and Chivalry, mighty for its large and compact
<PB N="92" REF="55"/>Territory, as for its Fertility, and conve∣nience of Conveyance from Province to Pro∣vince, and for the In-land Fortresses, and of late suspectful also for their Maritime Advancements, while other Princes slept, or regarded not that growing Mischief; more potent also by many ad∣ditions of Conquest of late years, since Fortune hath turned her ballance, and rejected the <HI>Spani∣ard;</HI> so that the <HI>French</HI> King is absolutely the greatest Prince in the Continent of <HI>Europe:</HI> And he aspires also now to the Sea, by his late Pro∣jects of making Guilds and Companies for the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, where scarce a Ship of his hath been ever seen Trading. But to return to his Revenue; In the year 1643. the Taxes and Tallages alone amounted to five Millions Sterling. The Impost of Salt amounts yearly to two Millions of Pounds Sterling, which is an insuportable Burden upon the poor People, who are forced to take such quantities yearly, more than they can use, at the Kings excessive Rates. It is true, that <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th. had once designed to buy all the Salt Pits in <HI>Poitou</HI> and <HI>Brittany,</HI> that were in particu∣lar mens hands, and to have fold the Salt at those Places to the Merchants, at a Price he should set, and they to sell it over the Kingdom, as Corn is in the Market, without any Compulsion or Impost; by which means, twenty thousand Officers would be spared, all which are paid at the Charge of the King: and the poor Subject should have it four times cheaper than it is now sold, and the King also put more Money in his Pocket, with-not any trouble.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="55"/>
<P>His next Revenue consists in his Customes of all Merchandises, exported and imported, which arose in the year 1648. as by Computation was found, to the summ of ten Millions Sterling; and his Customes do not grow less, but greater every day: but of all this Revenue, scarce the tenth part comes and remains in the Kings Treasury. Thus large is the Intrado or Income, and the Issue is but little narrower. The Kings Table stands him in 500000 <HI>l.</HI> yearly, besides the Daulphins, and the Queens Expences of Court. The King hath every day nine Suits of Cloaths appointed to be made him, but the Money designed thereto, comes into the Lord Chamberlains Pocket, this King not affecting too frequent shift. Then in Pensions, and yearly Interest, there is paid seven Millions more; And for many years together, nu∣merous Armies have been maintained, although in such Cases the King extends his Prerogative, and takes what he pleaseth: Not to mention his Sale of Offices, which amounts to very vast summs; (the Office of the Great Master of Artillery being worth 500000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling) nor his disposal of Ecclesiastical Benefices, the right whereof is sole∣ly his, without the Popes intermedling in the least; and the Clergy possess there no less than 30. Millions Sterling of yearly Rent.</P>
<P>And because we have here instanced his Armies, and touched before something of the Force of this Kingdom, we will give a summary account of those Forces he had on foot in 1662. to bring down the Discourse to these modern times. Of Horse, besides 12. Comets of Foreigners, he
<PB N="94" REF="56"/>had in Pay 240. Troops, Cavaliers of his own Nation, which in all amounted to above 30. thou∣sand: Of Foot, he had 210. Regiments, some few of them of 30. Companies, and consisting of 90. Men in a Company; not reckoning in the <HI>Switzers,</HI> who make 6. or 7000. besides some <HI>Scots, Irish, Italians,</HI> and <HI>Luyckers.</HI> At Sea, he had 30. Ships of War, and 25. Gallyes, and the number is now increased; and their Lord Great Admiral, the Duke of <HI>Vendosme,</HI> which was before a meer Titulado, with great Profit and Revenue, become an Officer <HI>de facto,</HI> and of great service in that Kingdom: The Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> his Son, commanding the Fleet before <HI>Algier.</HI></P>
<P>The King hath four Guards; the first of <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen, in Place and Attendance like our Gentlemen Pensioners, they are 200. in number, their Pay 20. Crowns a Month. The second consists of <HI>Scots,</HI> and they Gentlemen, some at∣tending on the Kings Person, others appointed to other Offices in the Court, and go alwayes armed either with the Halberd or Harquebuze; those which attend on the Kings Person are 24. and receive yearly 400. Franks apiece, the resi∣due 300. and a Livery. The third sort is of in∣feriour <HI>French,</HI> and their Employment is such as the service of the Yeomen, and the Guard in <HI>England.</HI> The fourth consisteth of <HI>Switzers,</HI> and they wait at the Court Gate in warlike manner. This King retaineth the <HI>Switzers,</HI> more to dis-en∣gage them from their Respects to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and that Families service, than for any
<PB N="95" REF="56"/>other reason, though the long Correspondence maintained with those Cantons, hath abated of that jealousie. Now notwithstanding, for the number of the Gentry, which is infinite almost, the greatness of the Offices, goodliness of Towns, and multitudes of Forces, and store of Ammuniti∣on, this Kingdom may seem to challenge Prece∣dence before any Court in <HI>Europe;</HI> yet for Ma∣jesty of the Prince, Order of the Court, Provi∣sion of the Courtiers, and Entertainment of Stran∣gers, it may no way compare with that of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> and this is not mine, but a Foreigners judge∣ment of them Both.</P>
<P>As to the Government, it is Monarchical to Excess; as it was said of <HI>Caesar, Voluntas</HI> Caesaris <HI>pro Lege habebatur,</HI> so it is as true of the <HI>French</HI> Kings, <HI>Their Will is the Law;</HI> For though they have now nine Parliaments in the Kingdom, and that of <HI>Pau</HI> in <HI>Bern</HI> added by <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13th. yet are they no more such a Constitution as Ours, than Our Late High Courts of Justice, which were Persons pick'd for the Usurpers purpose. The main work of these Parliaments is to ratifie the Kings Edicts, which are sent to them with a Com∣mand, that such is <HI>Our Pleasure:</HI> Nor doth this Ratification, when done, signifie any thing to the Validity of the Kings Acts, but is meerly for shew, and to personate that Authority, which was in the former Parliaments, even till the time of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13th. By which means, the King imposeth upon his Subjects what he lists, and sup∣plyes that want of Patrimony, which is mostly aliened, and is the great Blemish of this Crown,

<PB N="96" REF="58"/>which commands so fair and spacious a Territory, and yet hath very few Mannours or Houses of its own, except about <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>And for the better support of this way of Go∣vernment, the Nobility are most of them employ∣ed in Offices and Commands; the whole Kingdom being divided into 12. Lieutenancies, as Imperi∣ous altogether as our late Major Generalls, and who; enjoying the sweets of their Arbitrary Pow∣er, help to awe the People to a stupid Acquies∣cence under their Oppression: And these Gover∣nours continue during life, and are sometime Haereditary; so that not seldom they have dis∣puted it with the King, and stood upon their Terms.</P>
<P>The Interest of this Crown is of late very per∣plexed, and very closely carried; the late League with <HI>Spain</HI> seems to be zealously regarded; and many good words are given the Emperour of As∣sistance and Friendship; Greater Respect was ne∣ver given, nor higher Professions of Amity ever expressed towards the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> The Pope and He seem to be reconciled, and the Con∣firmation of the Friendship between them is now <HI>in Actu,</HI> by the Popes Performance of the Conclusion made at <HI>Pisa;</HI> for that Cardinal <HI>Chigi,</HI> the Popes Legate, for the greater solemnity of this Affair, is on his way with the Satisfaction a∣greed on: The Duke <HI>Crequy</HI> is ready to return to <HI>Rome,</HI> where the Pyramis is erected, in memory of the Fact of the <HI>Corsi;</HI> and <HI>Don Mario,</HI> the Popes Nephew, upon his departure: But when all this is done, no man conceives the Christian
<PB N="97" REF="58"/>World more assured, or freed from those jealou∣sies, which it hath long conceived of the Potency of this King.</P>
<P>He hath lately made a motion in <HI>Germany</HI> about <HI>Colmar</HI> and <HI>Slecksladt,</HI> and it is suspected, they are the light Trepidations of some greater Rupture thereabouts; for that the <HI>French</HI> have long aimed upon the Imperial Dignity, is obvious to every eye, and this Prince is supposed to be more ambiti∣ously bent upon that design, than any of his Prede∣cessors. He hath to the purpose baffled and terrified the Pope, the Emperours left hand, and scared him before hand; and for his right hand, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> besides the Peace between them, he will not be remiss in fomenting the War with <HI>Portugal.</HI> The Princes of the Empire therefore give him fair words, and will oblige him, by performing his De∣mands about those Towns. He is sure of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> so long as he enterpriseth not upon <HI>Italy,</HI> for then he would become a Morsel between his Grinders. As to the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> they do not care to see him there, but love him well enough in <HI>France.</HI> We neither suspect nor dread this Riddle of Fate, nor shall want a Sword to solve it, if with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and any body else, he could make a three∣fold Cord of it; and so we leave him to the Revolu∣tion of Time. His Kingdom of <HI>Navarre</HI> lying in <HI>Spain,</HI> we shall mention it there.</P>

<P><HI>SPAIN</HI> is defended towards <HI>France,</HI> on the North, with Confines strengthened both by Nature and Art, <HI>viz.</HI> by the Natural Height of the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Mountains, which separate the one Country from the other; and by the Artificial Forts of <HI>Scialon, Parpignian,</HI> and <HI>Pampalone,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Navarre:</HI> on all other sides it is encompass'd with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea. Its Empire is divided into four Parts or Members, but we shall mention one only here, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The Kingdomes of <HI>Spain.</HI> 2. The States of <HI>Italy, Sicily,</HI> &amp;c. And 3. <HI>Flan∣ders.</HI> And 4. The Dominions of <HI>India. Spain</HI> is by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for the greater grace, divided into 15. Kingdomes, namely, <HI>Castile, Aragon, Murcia, Granada, Gallicia, Guypuscoa, Biscay, Oviedo, Leon, Corduba, Toledo, Navarre, Ca∣talonia, Majorca, Valentia,</HI> and lastly <HI>Portugal:</HI> but it being wrested from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions, as it was formerly, and now is a distinct Soverain∣ty, we will treat of the other 14. together, and of that by it self.</P>
<P>The Country it self is very barren, if we con∣sider each part thereof by it self alone, but all be∣ing
<PB N="99" REF="59"/>reduced together, it aboundeth, and is suffi∣ently stored with all Necessaries, and is particular∣ly furnished with Minerals. It is not very Popu∣lous, both by reason the <HI>Spanish</HI> Man is not apt for Generation, being more hot than virile in his Lust; and the Women are Mothers so young and early, that Nature is decayed in them before the half of their Teeming. And 2. Because such vast numbers have been drawn thence continually, to serve in the Wars, and to re-inforce Garrisons; as also, for that many of his Subjects do excercise Navigation, especially in great numbers to the <HI>Indies;</HI> which is peopled, what it is, with <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> only, and the Natives, for they will not trust other people on shore, they are so jealous of their wealth; nevertheless, the Country is by this means rid of all slothful home-livers.</P>
<P>Most of those Kingdoms above mentioned were conquered and won from the <HI>Moors,</HI> and the At∣chievement made by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabel,</HI> Kings of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Aragon;</HI> which two Kingdomes, with <HI>Leon,</HI> became united by their Marriage at this same time: And for <HI>Navarre,</HI> it was seized by the Policy and Valour of this <HI>Fer∣dinand,</HI> as we shall speak more at large of it, be∣cause it is the Title of the <HI>French</HI> King, and the House of <HI>Bourbon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NAVARRE</HI> is bounded on the East with the Principality of <HI>Bearn,</HI> (in the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI>) and acknowledging the same Soveraign∣ty; on the West with the River <HI>Iberus,</HI> which di∣vides it from <HI>Castile;</HI> on the North by the <HI>Canta∣brian</HI> Mountains, which part it from <HI>Guypuscoa;</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="60"/>and on the South with <HI>Aragon.</HI> It taketh up some parts of both sides the <HI>Pyrences,</HI> but the sixth part of it lyeth on the <HI>French</HI> side, and is very steril, it is called the <HI>Base</HI> or <HI>Low Navarre,</HI> which <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13th. united with <HI>Bearn,</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> Crown; the other being called the <HI>High Navarre,</HI> lyeth on the <HI>Spanish</HI> side, and is fertile, and adorn∣ed with Trees.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Albret,</HI> who had mar∣ried <HI>Catherine,</HI> Sister and Heir of <HI>Francis,</HI> the last of the House of <HI>Foix,</HI> Kings of <HI>Navarre, Ferdinand,</HI> the most Catholique King, who had Conquered the Kingdom of <HI>Granada</HI> from the <HI>Moors,</HI> and united the two Potent Kingdomes of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Aragon,</HI> to which all the other, but this, and <HI>Portugal,</HI> were one way or other in∣corporated; resolved to add this also, and to compleat the Monarchy of <HI>Spain.</HI> Hereupon, in the year 1512. pretending a final and utter Ex∣tirpation of the <HI>Moors,</HI> he raised an Army, and of a sudden marched towards <HI>Navarre,</HI> demanding of them passage for his Army into <HI>France; Lewis</HI> the 12th. the King whereof, with all his Subjects, were then under Excommunication, the Execu∣tioner of which <HI>Ferdinand</HI> undertook to be, as his Successors have done ever since; which being waved by K ng <HI>John,</HI> and his Queen, he imme∣diately en red the Country, and without the stri∣king of a blow, reduced it; the <HI>French</HI> King be∣ing backward to the relief of it then, but after∣wards endeavouring with all his Power to recover it, when it was too late, being fortified and secu∣red by the Conquerour. Not long after, in 1556. by
<PB N="101" REF="60"/><HI>Joan</HI> the Daughter and Heir of Henry of <HI>Albret,</HI> this Title, with the sixth part mentioned before, came to <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> Duke of <HI>Vendosme,</HI> Father of <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th. of <HI>France;</HI> but the design of regaining this his paternal Inheritance, (by reason of his tedious War for the <HI>French</HI> Crown) was to him also unfeasible; but had he survived that fatal stroke, given him by <HI>Ravilliac,</HI> no doubt he would have bid fair for this his just Right; to which his Successors have such an appetite, (as Patrimony is a great Magnetick) that in all Trea∣ties with <HI>Spain</HI> since, they insert <HI>a salvo jure,</HI> a saving of their Claim, Right and Title to <HI>Na∣varre,</HI> to be lawful for them to prosecute in an ordinary Course of Justice; but that Justice hath no Courts, nor have Princes Patience or Hope in the Brawles of Lawyers, or those Decrees which cannot give Seizin and Delivery. A lucky oppor∣tunity for a re-surprize, is only worthy of their ex∣pectation.</P>
<P>The other Kingdomes taking up too much room and time in their Limitation and Description, we will mention and comprize together, giving the Reader to understand, that <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Aragon</HI> are the most noble, as who have made all those Ac∣quisitions of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Greatness; and their di∣stinct Titles were these; to <HI>Arragon</HI> belonged <HI>Sicily, Sardinia, Majorca, Valentia, Catalo∣nia, Navarre,</HI> and <HI>Naples:</HI> To <HI>Castile</HI> belonged <HI>Leon; Gallicia, Toledo, Murcia, Biscay, Gra∣nada,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> because Queen <HI>Isabel</HI> furnish∣ed <HI>Columbus.</HI> Nor was <HI>Navarre,</HI> when under its former Princes, far behind them in such Atchieve∣ments
<PB N="102" REF="61"/>on the <HI>French</HI> side. Note we also, that the County of <HI>Rossilluon,</HI> formerly a Member of the Kingdom of <HI>Majorca,</HI> is by the late general Trea∣ty, together with the Viguery of <HI>Conflans,</HI> and part of the County of <HI>Cerdana,</HI> as is situate in the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Mountains towards <HI>France,</HI> and not be∣longing to <HI>Catalonia,</HI> assigned by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> for ever, to whom it was long since pawned for 300000. Crowns, but remitted by <HI>Charles</HI> the 8th. of <HI>France,</HI> to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Catholique, upon condition he should not hinder him in the Conquest of <HI>Naples.</HI> By the same Treaty the <HI>French</HI> surrendred all his Garrisons and Places he had taken in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> excepting such as should be found to belong to the County of <HI>Cerdana</HI> a∣foresaid.</P>
<P>These 14. Kingdomes are governed by the same Court, or Imperial Laws, intermix'd with some Customes of the <HI>Goths,</HI> and some additional Con∣stitutions of their Kings, and the Government conserved by Justice, impartially here executed, and the Inquisition in Ecclesiastical Affairs; so that there is never like to be a War upon pretence of Reformation in this Kingdom. To give the Peo∣ple their due, (whether it is, that that Inquisiti∣on hath awed them to it) they are very devout and zealous, and most Loyal to their Prince, whom they will spare no blood nor treasure to aggran∣dize, and of whom they never speak without great reverence and honour, and in his service, no men can possibly be more patient, or endure more mi∣sery and hardness, than will they, even to the ut∣most and worst of Extremity; and as faithful and
<PB N="103" REF="61"/>true they are to him, there having been few Tray∣tors of all his Subjects, nor any Command or Trust betrayed by any of them. Generally of them∣selves, they are very grave and serious in all their Actions, and yet notwithstanding so addicted to Pride, that they think all the World pittiful Fel∣lows and Fools, in comparison of themselves. In summ, they have effected great and noble things, <HI>viz.</HI> their Conquest over the <HI>Moors,</HI> and the <HI>New World,</HI> together with <HI>Philip</HI> the Second's Conquest or Possession of <HI>Portugal:</HI> and they have failed of as great, <HI>viz.</HI> their Design upon <HI>England</HI> in 88. and in their Grand Project of an Universal Empire, which hath almost broke the Heart of this Monarchy.</P>
<P>The Government is Absolute and Royal, Mat∣ters of several qualities are handled in several Councils, and they are seven in number; which, that the King may be the better informed of all Af∣fairs, they keep alwayes near about his Person, in several Chambers under one Roof; their Names are these, The Council of <HI>Spain.</HI> 2. Of the <HI>In∣dies.</HI> 3. Of <HI>Italy.</HI> 4. Of the <HI>Low Countries.</HI> 5. of War. 6. Of the Order of St. <HI>John.</HI> And 7. Of the Inquisition. In these the slow and con∣siderate Advisoes of <HI>Fabim,</HI> rather than the prae∣cipitant Resolutions of <HI>Marcellus,</HI> are received. In as much as may be, Innovations and change of ancient Customes are avoided, by which constan∣cy, and their wariness in their Actions, they do seldom commit any oversight, or fall into any dis∣order or rupture at home. By this way of Coun∣cil, the King rangeth under his Obedience <HI>Castili∣ans,
<PB N="104" REF="62"/>Arragons, Biscayners, Flemings, Italians, Indians, Christians,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> People utterly different in Laws, Customes, and Natures, as if they were all of one Nation, and all his natural Sub∣jects.</P>
<P>The ill Correspondency that is alwayes amongst those Counsellours, who aemulate one anothers greatness, is the Cause of long Deliberations and Slackness in Matters of greatest Importance; but all Matters once resolved on in Council, pass in∣differently, with incredible and surpassing secrecy, as well those of mean, as those of the weightiest Consideration. Secrecy of all securing every par∣ticular, and being indeed the true scope of all Mat∣ters of State; for Designes as soon as they have ta∣ken air are blasted therewith.</P>
<P>In this point, <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. of <HI>Spain,</HI> the a∣blest Prince of his time, was very tenacious, do∣ing many things with his own hand, which never came near his Secretaries, but were transmitted by himself uncopied (but what he took likewise himself) to his Expresses and Dispatches. In his last Advice to his Son there are these words; <HI>Do not offend or anger the Secretaries, deliver them al∣wayes work of small or great importance, and make proof of them rather by your Enemies than your Friends, lock your chief secrets in your own breast.</HI> In this Prince failed that high-flown Ambition, which had tormented his Father <HI>Charles</HI> and Him∣self, during the whole course of their Reign, namely, the Conceit of an Universal Monarchy; nor did it dye with him, for having all his life stu∣died nothing more than the ruine of <HI>France</HI> by the
<PB N="105" REF="62"/>League, and his own Armes, he commended the pursute of the Design to his Son; having also a lit∣tle before his death resolved on another Expediti∣on for <HI>England,</HI> having procured a more exact ac∣count of its Havens, the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but his Successor <HI>Philip</HI> the 3d. (for his Son <HI>Charles</HI> was murthered in the Inquisition (as suspected to favour the Protestants) by his own consent) see∣ing how the Treasure was wasted, and his Fathers Credit engaged for divers vaste Summs of Money, not fully paid to this day, but running on Interest, and discharged by degrees, resolved to steer ano∣ther Course, and first made Peace with <HI>England,</HI> and then a Truce with the <HI>Dutch</HI> for 12. Years; and, as the greatest Act of his Reign, utterly ex∣pelled the <HI>Moors,</HI> 1100000. being driven out af∣ter their former Expulsion by <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who, lest the Country should be dispeopled, suffered such as would turn Christians to stay, but now the Inquisition discovered them all for Hypocrites, and entitled the King to a brave Patrimony. This same <HI>Philip</HI> the 3d. was a great Stickler for the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> War, newly begun with the Elector Palatine, at which time in 1621. he died, and his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the 4th. suc∣ceeded, with whom was that fruitless Treaty of the Marriage of the <HI>Infanta,</HI> and the Restitution of the Palatinate.</P>
<P>This Prince hath been embroyled in the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> War all along against his Inclination, which is otherwise disposed, for he loves quiet and pleasure, and vacancy from those troubles of Empire which afflict ambitious People; and it is
<PB N="106" REF="63"/>hoped therefore he will hearken, now in his old age, to a Composure with <HI>Portugal,</HI> from which he hath reaped more loss and dishonour, than the Kingdom can be worth to him. Besides, there are some Reasons of State, why the Army of <HI>Spain</HI> should be disbanded, and no Forces more than u∣sual kept on Foot, lest the General make some di∣sturbance in the Succession, who hath the Clergy and the Souldiery on his side. However, at pre∣sent nothing is more eagerly carried on, than the Preparations for this Campagnia; but what the issue will be, either Peace or Victory, time will de∣cide.</P>
<P>As to the Forces of this Kingdom, the same may be said of them as of the Bees; <HI>Quae Regio in terris nostri non plena laboris:</HI> There is no Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> but the remote Northern Kingdomes, that have not felt the Puissance thereof; and it is well known, that in all ages, the <HI>Spanish</HI> have been accounted one of the most Valorous Nations in the World. The <HI>French</HI> in nine Years were sub∣dued to the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoak, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> held out 200. and then too, the Fortune and Person of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> the Universal Conquerour, was requisite to their Subjugation. They serve better on Foot than on Horseback, although they have Horses of excellent Courage, and better with the Harquebuze, than with any other Weapon. As concerning their Cavalry, it cannot be gain-said, but that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gennet is the noblest Horse in <HI>Christendom,</HI> far excelling the Courser of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> or the Horse of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> so much esteem∣ed of the <HI>French;</HI> or the <HI>Friesland</HI> Horse, in so
<PB N="107" REF="63"/>great request with the <HI>Germans.</HI> And it should seem, that Nature her self hath armed this Peo∣ple, in giving them the Iron Mines of <HI>Biskay, Guypuscoa,</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> with the Temperatures of <HI>Bilbo, Toledo,</HI> &amp;c. To conclude, as to the number of the Forces aforesaid, this Prince is of that Mightiness and Reputation to this day, that, besides his own Subjects, he is able to wage what numbers of Horsemen and Footmen of the <HI>Ger∣mans, Italian,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Nations it pleaseth him; besides, his Noblemen are bound to bring so ma∣ny Horse into the Field, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he that re∣members how the War was carried on in <HI>Catalonia, Portugal, Italy,</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries</HI> together, cannot but resolve, that his Puissance is most con∣siderable. At all times his Majesty is likewise constrained to maintain a strong <HI>Armada</HI> in these Seas, to safeguard the Navigation to the <HI>Indies;</HI> besides 24. Gallies to guard the Coast from the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Charge whereof is a Million of Crowns. There are besides 8000. praesidiary Souldiers, and no more, in the Frontier, and Coast Towns of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Charge whereof I saw not com∣puted.</P>
<P>As to the Revenue of this Potentate, the ordi∣nary Income thereof amounts to six Millions of Gold, or 11. Millions of Crowns yearly, where∣of much is engaged for the Debts of the Crown, the rest is spent in Charges of the Wars, the main∣tenance of the Kings Houshold, and in the Gallies furnished against the <HI>Barbary</HI> Pirates. To this may be added, as another ordinary Revenue, the two Millions of Crowns which he receives yearly of the
<PB N="108" REF="64"/>Clergy, together with the Commendams of vacant Praesentations, and the praeferring to Benefices. The whole Revenues of the Clergy are valued at six Millions of Gold yearly Rent, there being 34. Cathedral Churches, all richly endowed, some whereof having 50. some a 100. and some 200. Millions of yearly Revenue, and in particular, the Metropolitan Arch-Bishop of <HI>Toledo</HI> hath more than 300. Millions: Neither do the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> care to parcel these Churches to a greater number, although over-grown with their plenty, for then they should with more difficulty make use of the Revenues and Notes thereof, when occasi∣on required, which is very often, upon any disa∣strous Event. As he likewise layes extraordinary Taxes upon the Laity in the like Occurrence, for in the Kingdom of <HI>Castile</HI> alone, <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. had nigh 8. Millions of Gold in one year; reckon∣ning hereto also the Profits which his Orders of Knighthood yield him, <HI>viz.</HI> 200. Millions of Crowns; so that here is Revenue more than e∣nough, were it not for the Canker of Interest at the Bank of <HI>Genoa,</HI> nor are the Merchants of <HI>Ant∣werp</HI> without their share in the partition thereof; and now the <HI>Amsterdammers</HI> also.</P>
<P>This Princes Coyn notwithstanding is the best in <HI>Europe,</HI> since all their Neighbours make a gain of them, as a Piece of Reals, or 8. Six-Pences in our Money, goeth in <HI>France</HI> for 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>6.</HI> a Doub∣lin in Gold, that which is a Pistolet with them, being 13. Shillings, is in <HI>France,</HI> and other Pla∣ces, 29. Reals, which is 14 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> of our Money. Most of the Coyn that passeth for Wine, Bread,
<PB N="109" REF="64"/>Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is of Brass, which they call Quartas, and Quartillas; of their Maravedies, 20. make three-pence; but sometime the King enhanceth the Price of this Brass Money of a sudden, and with a great deal of profit to himself, brings a great loss upon Trade. All their Meat, Fruit and Bread, are sold by the Pound, and not except before an Officer, which they call <HI>Alcalda,</HI> so that no Stranger can be deceived in price or weight.</P>
<P>As to the Interest of these Princes, it hath been evidently seen what it hath been; but since the <HI>French</HI> mated them under <HI>Francis</HI> the First, and held them to it, till <HI>Lewis</HI> the 14th. was too powerful for them; since the <HI>Dutch</HI> baffled them, and We triumphed over them, they have been put to defend their own, instead of over-running others. Their Designes are now to secure their Estates, and to draw from them that Revenue into their Coffers, which was squandred away in the War, without any account; and yet to be as gen∣tle a Soveraign as possible. For all the late League, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> nor <HI>French</HI> will ever joyn Interests, or agree together, more than they do in their Hu∣mours or Fashions. In fine, they really hate one another, but more revengefully the <HI>Spaniard</HI> frets at the <HI>French,</HI> as he that first put a stop to his Career of Ambition; and therefore there's no∣thing but Jealousie and Suspition between them, however smoothed and oyled over with Court Ar∣tifices, alike understood for such on both sides; nor have their late frequent Consanguinities and Marriages any influences to draw them nearer to a∣ny amicable understanding.</P>
<PB N="110" REF="65"/>
<P>With the <HI>Dutch</HI> he firmly keeps a good Corres¦pondence, as his very good Friends, since Fate would needs have it so, and useth them very re∣spectfully, as his good Neighbours, and as securi∣ty to his Estates in <HI>Flanders;</HI> for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as was said, do not love the <HI>Frenchmens</HI> vicinity. For the King of <HI>England,</HI> he cherisheth a more than usual respect, testified by those publique Honours done his Ambassador Sr. <HI>Richard Fanshaw</HI> in that Kingdom, and inviolably observeth the Peace betwixt us. With the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> he is newly reconciled, and certainly that Duke (who hath the Citadel of <HI>Verceil</HI> restored him by this King, by vertue of the late Treaty) hath no great Antipathy against Him, for he hath suffered twice more from the <HI>French,</HI> than from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who is as well able to Defend Him, as he is con∣veniently scited to Offend him upon every displea∣sure. The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> is allyed to him, and so sure to his Interest. The <HI>Florentine</HI> is stiff, but is aequal between the <HI>French</HI> and Him. The <HI>Mantuan</HI> will be Neutral; and the Pope his secret Friend. The Prince of <HI>Modena</HI> will hardly en∣gage any more against Him, for in a manner he is the Umpire of all Quarrells between those Prin∣ces. He is Patron also to the Common-Wealth of <HI>Luca.</HI> And for the States of <HI>Venice,</HI> ever since the Dutchy of <HI>Millain</HI> came to the possession of this Crown, they have set them down with great quietness, rather looking to the strengthening of their own, than attempting his; and good reason too, for our Ancestors have seen the <HI>Spanish,</HI> favouring the <HI>Venetians,</HI> (when their Estate was
<PB N="111" REF="65"/>dangerously hazarded by the <HI>Turk</HI>) chearfully to have entred into the Actions of <HI>Cephalonia</HI> and <HI>Le∣panto,</HI> when nevertheless at the same instant they had at their own Doors <HI>Algier, Tunis,</HI> and other <HI>African</HI> Ports, their dangerous Enemies. The State of <HI>Genoa</HI> must favour the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and stand by him, for he is their Protector, and owes them vast summs, which by any partiality of their side will be wholly lost. With all the Catholique Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> he is in perfect Correspon∣dence, and how great a relation and necessity of mutual adhaerence there is between the Emperour and Him, no man is ignorant, confirmed now, and more intimately contracted by the late Marriage of the Infanta. With the King of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco</HI> his Catholique Majesty is in League, but it is of no use or availment to him. Of the Religion of <HI>Malta</HI> the King taketh a particular protection, as that in like sort depends wholly upon his pleasure, and doth readily execute his Royal Commandements, serving him often in keeping the Coasts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Kingdomes of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> from Incursions of Pyrates, and that without one penny cost or charges to the King.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Turk,</HI> he maintains no intercourse, nor useth any Trade with him, and yet he hath neither Peace nor War with him; Peace he pre∣tends he ought not to have, and the other he ca∣reth not for; and the <HI>Turk</HI> is as unwilling to quar∣rel as he, remembring what he suffered from him at <HI>Lepanto:</HI> So that pivate Damages are privately made good, and the <HI>Algier</HI> men do take upon themselves the Rupture, if any louder Mischief
<PB N="112" REF="66"/>happen, of which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> will not complain. It is thought that this King is Superiour to the <HI>Turk</HI> in Naval Furniture and Provision, and the Cou∣rage and Ability of Seamen, for his <HI>Biskayners</HI> and <HI>Catalonians</HI> are hardly to be paralleled for enduring of Winter weather and Tempests: and the <HI>Turk</HI> is alwayes moared at home from <HI>October</HI> to <HI>March;</HI> besides the convenience of his Coast for building of Ships and Gallies, of which he hath a 100. in readiness: and the <HI>Turk</HI> hath but two Places all a∣long his <HI>African</HI> Coast, <HI>viz. Algier</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> where he can build a Vessel.</P>
<P>Upon this account it was, that <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. was advised to seize upon the <HI>Morea</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> those People being willing to embrace a Christian Defender against that unsupportable slavery which they suffer from the <HI>Turk;</HI> but he considering his Fathers ill success in <HI>Africa,</HI> (though ascribable more to Tempest, than to any other Cause) would never cast his eye upon that Enterprize, being bent upon far worse, to the disturbance of <HI>Chri∣stendom;</HI> so that it appears, he is the only Prince, that is able to give him a Potent Diversion, were not his Fleets otherwise employed.</P>
<P>But withall, this King at present is so exhaust∣ed, that he is not in a Capacity to undertake such an Expedition, without the assistance of other Christian Princes, which the <HI>Venetians</HI> have a long while in vain implored, and he cannot hope to ex∣pect it till the danger is more eminent, and then hee'l find wayes to defend himself: This may be certainly concluded on, he will do what in him ly∣eth, to keep the <HI>Turk</HI> from swallowing the Haere∣ditary
<PB N="113" REF="66"/>Countries of the Emperour, in which he hath an Expectation and Reversion, and will spare him such Supplies, however he pincheth for it, as shall testifie his Zeal, Affection and Care for the Imperial Family: And so having finished this sur∣vey of <HI>Spain,</HI> we will next take a short view of <HI>Por∣tugall.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PORTUGALL.</HEAD>
<P>INto this Kingdom of <HI>Portugall</HI> are reckoned, as in <HI>Spain,</HI> two other Kingdomes, so teeming are these little Soveraignties of other Principali∣ties, namely, the Kingdom of <HI>Algarve,</HI> and that of the Isles of the <HI>Azores,</HI> or the <HI>Terceras. Por∣tugall</HI> is bounded on the North with two Rivers, which part it from <HI>Gallicia;</HI> on the South with <HI>Algarve,</HI> on the West with the <HI>Atlantique</HI> Oce∣an; and on the East with the new and old <HI>Castile.</HI> Extended on the Sea Coast from North to South, reckoning in the Kingdom of <HI>Algarve,</HI> 400. Miles; in breadth not exceeding a 100. and in some places not 80. and 60. The Country is very destitute and unprovided of Corn, but that supplyed by Wine, Oyl, Figgs, and other Fruits; as for Cattel, they have no store, nor have they much
<PB N="114" REF="67"/>use of them, as in <HI>Spain,</HI> the People being natu∣rally hot and dry, and delighting in Fruits and Sal∣lads, as cooling and satisfying also.</P>
<P>This Kingdom is now governed by <HI>Alphonso</HI> the 6th: (who hath a Brother, a very hopeful Gen∣tleman, named <HI>Don Pedro</HI>) of the House of <HI>Bra∣ganza,</HI> whose Claim against <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. (de∣scended of <HI>Mary,</HI> fifth Daughter of <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> but immediate surviving Heir to <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> her Brother, (third Son of <HI>Emanuel</HI>) Cardinal and King of <HI>Portugall</HI>) was judged lost when the Crown came into his Fathers Possession, for that his Ancestor had married <HI>Katherine,</HI> the Daughter of Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> fourth Son of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> who dyed indeed before his Brother the Cardinal King <HI>Henry.</HI> It is true, the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> had mar∣ried <HI>Mary</HI> her elder Sister, but against that the <HI>Civilians</HI> alleged, that the Crown, by a peculiar Law of that Kingdom, passed in such Cases to such Heirs as were Natives of the Realm: However the Title was, the People were resolved the House of <HI>Braganza</HI> should have the Crown, which was wonderfully accomplish'd in 1640. and of which we will discourse no further.</P>
<P>This Crown hath had wonderful Successes, both in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,</HI> where they have wrest∣ed <HI>Brasile</HI> from the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and at Home also; for though they be but a handful of People, yet by immuring themselves in such strong Places, as they took by Shipping and Naval Sieges from the <HI>Indi∣ans;</HI> and venturing in all weathers to relieve one another, to the disappointment of their Enemies, who thought by Sieges at Land to recover the Pla∣ces
<PB N="115" REF="67"/>they had lost by the opportunity of such tem∣pestuous seasons, they have fixed themselves so in those <HI>Indies,</HI> that they command a great part thereof, and the best also, till by our Assistance, some forty Years agoe, the <HI>Persian</HI> recovered <HI>Or∣mus,</HI> the notedst Place of Trade then in the East; and in defence whereof, they defeated two Na∣vies of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who hath his City and Port of <HI>Aden</HI> in the same Sea; but now the <HI>Turk</HI> and they have done, and the <HI>Persian</HI> is in their room.</P>
<P>At Home he is engaged against the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but the War hath proved so fortunate to him, that he hath rather got than lost by it; however, it is hoped it will be composed by a Peace, although there are several Interests which do with-hold it all they can. The <HI>French</HI> deserted them by the late general Treaty, but it is conceived they would stick as close to them now. The <HI>Dutch</HI> do no way care that the <HI>Portugalls</HI> should have Peace at home, for their fingers itch at <HI>Brasile,</HI> and they have been long quarrelling about it for Damages, but they are in fear of Seconds; besides that, they are now in prosecution of a War in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where also they have had some Successes. It concerns Us, that the King of <HI>Portugall,</HI> our chief Ally, should be advanced to a Condition of Prosperity and Grandeur, and no wayes will be omitted con∣ducing thereunto. With other Princes and States this Kingdom hath not to do, save with the Pope, who hath at last promised the Confirmation of all Ecclesiastical Preferments, and the Bishops other Clergy in that Kingdom: Unless with some of the
<PB N="116" REF="68"/><HI>African</HI> Potentates, which Affair is devolved up∣on our Shoulders, by our Possession of <HI>Tangier,</HI> as we are likewise of some Places in the Kingdom of <HI>Goa,</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> By all which it may be guessed, what a great loss happened to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> when this Kingdom, and all its Dominions, at the same day revolted from him.</P>
<P>The Force of this Kingdom is not very great, the Commanders finding much adoe to bring 20000. Effectif Men into the Field against the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> nor are those well provided or harnes∣sed; but such hath been their resolution and ani∣mosity against their old Enemy the <HI>Castilians,</HI> that they have generally carried away the <HI>Victory;</HI> and what <HI>Wings</HI> We have added to <HI>Her,</HI> Fame hath al∣ready told the World. As the Force but the <HI>For∣tune</HI> of this Kingdom is little considerable, so is the Revenue, saving that the Patrimony of this Prince is of great value, and yearly Intrado, for, as Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> he possesseth more than one third of the Kingdom, and there is a little belong∣ing to the Crown. The rest of his Revenues come by his Customes, with this he maintains se∣veral Store-houses all along the Country, a dayes march commonly from one another, for the sub∣sistence of the marching Army, and the relief of the sick or travelling Souldiers with Passes; as he doth Ships of War for security of his Trade, that of Sugar bringing him in exceeding great Profit.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Turk,</HI> he hath no leisure to look to∣wards him, nor is he accommodated with Ships or Naval Apparel to engage him, His Navy consist∣ing
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>chiefly of great and slow Gallions, built for Burden, and Defence, and against swelling Seas, and for other Coasts, and the great deep Ocean, so that they would soon perish in the windings of the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> and therefore we cannot con∣sider him as any Help against the Common Enemy, but must look upon his Quarrel as fatal to the Chri∣stian Cause; and therefore we should pray, that it would please God, maugre all Opposition, speedily to reconcile it: And so we pass through the <HI>Alps</HI> to the States of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>GENEVA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GENEVA</HI> is an Imperial City in <HI>Savoy,</HI> situated at the South end of the Lake <HI>Le∣mannus,</HI> upon the brink of the said Lake. It is in circuit about 2. <HI>English</HI> Miles, very strong both by Nature and Art, as well for that it is seated on a Hill, which on the West is not easily accessible, as also for that it is exceedingly well fortified with Ravelings, Bulwarks, and Platforms, besides a deep Ditch, the East and West parts thereof standing continually full of water, the South part remains dry continually, and is well defended with Casemates, the better to scour the Curtayn.
<PB N="118" REF="69"/>The Town is so much the stronger, for that it tandeth almost in an Island, having the Lake a∣foresaid on the North, the River <HI>Rhosne</HI> upon the West, and the River of <HI>Arba</HI> upon the South, be∣ing from the Town half a mile, and by reason of the swiftness of the Current, and great moveable Stones in the bottom, which are violently carried down, the River is not passable, but with great dan∣ger.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Rhosne</HI> divideth the Town into 2. parts, the one is called the <HI>High Town,</HI> and the other St. <HI>Gervais.</HI> It is well peopled, some 20000. of all sorts. Their Territories are small, being no way above 2. Leagues and a half, yet by reason the soyl is fruitful, being well manured, it bringeth Grain of all sorts, and good store of Wine. There are likewise many pasture and feed∣ing Grounds, by means whereof the Inhabitants are well provided of all sorts of good Flesh, at a reasonable rate; no want of good Butter and Cheese; and of wild-Foul, as Partridge, Quayl, Mallard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are also excellent Fruits, the rarest Pear-mains in the World; and the Ri∣ver, and the Lake, afford all manner of fresh Fish, as Carp, Tench, Roach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But above all, the biggest Carps in <HI>Europe.</HI> Besides, they are served out of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Country, and the Can∣ton of <HI>Bearn,</HI> by the Peasants of each, for that ready Money cannot be had else-where. It standeth al∣so convenient for, and doth exercise Merchan∣dise, being the ordinary transport of Commodi∣ties out of <HI>Germany</HI> to <HI>Lions,</HI> and so into <HI>France,</HI> and back again; by which means the Inhabitants
<PB N="119" REF="69"/>are grown very rich: As also, for that the <HI>Sa∣voyards,</HI> and the said People of <HI>Bearn,</HI> do resort hither to buy their Armour, Apparel, and other Necessaries, the Citizens being for the most part Mechanicks, and making excellent Muskets, Car∣bines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As also Satin, Velvet, and Taffa∣ty, though not so good as that of <HI>Italy.</HI> The Merchants that are here, are generally rich, and of great Estates.</P>
<P>The Revenue of this Town is some 100000. Crowns, which ariseth out of the Gabels of Mer∣chandise, Flesh, their Demayn, and Tithes, which is conserved in the common Treasury, and issued out thence to publick uses. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> pretends a Title to this Town, as governed before the Reformation by a Catholique Bishop, who being Lord thereof, as his temporal Estate, did homage for it to the said Duke; that the Mo∣ney the Bishop coyned bore his Inscription; that the Dukes of <HI>Savoy</HI> had alwayes an Office there, without acquaintance of which no sentence of Law could be executed; that the power of pardoning Offenders remained in the said Dukes. But the <HI>Genevois</HI> turn a deaf Ear to those Pretensions, but do therefore bear him a perpetual grudge, and hate him worse than all their Neighbours; nor do they much fear him, for neither the <HI>French,</HI> nor <HI>Spaniard,</HI> nor any of the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> will suffer him, or he, or they suffer one another, to possess themselves of this strong, commodious, and most convenient Fortress. Insomuch, that when any Design hath been formed against them, they have had timely notice thereof, besides Mo∣ney
<PB N="120" REF="70"/>to provide themselves with necessaries; but such is the careful Government of the place, that there is alwayes 6. Months Provision in the Store∣houses, and of Men and Munition they have enow within the Town; no less than 20. Guns being mounted on their Bulwarks, besides what they have in their Arsenal, wherein are 10. or 12. Canons and Culverins, with some lesser Ord∣nance, with Powder, Match, and Ball propor∣tionable to 4000. Muskets, lodged in the same Arsenal; they can also raise and maintain 2000. Men.</P>
<P>The Town is governed by a Council of 200. called the <HI>Great Council,</HI> out of which is chosen another Council, composed of five and twenty, and out of these 4. especial Men, whom, by a <HI>Greek</HI> term, they call <HI>Syndiques,</HI> that is, Co-Judges, who have the managing of the whole Common-wealth, unless it be in some great mat∣ters, wherein the whole State is concerned, as in making of Peace or War, Leagues offensive and defensive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then the whole Council is assembled. They are governed by the Civil Law, as generally the <HI>Germans</HI> are, the Judge whereof is called a <HI>Lieutenant Criminal,</HI> before whom all Causes are tried, and from whom lyes no appeal, but to the Council of two hundred. They allow no refuge to any Offenders of other Countries, but punish them as they should have been in the place where the Crime was committed.</P>
<P>I have been the more prolix in describing the Military and Secular Government, with the site and strength of the Place, because this is the <HI>Pal∣ladium</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="70"/>and Original of Presbytery, of whose Di∣scipline, and its share or influence in the Admi∣nistration of this Common-wealth, I purpose to speak more largely in the Conclusion, and will now take in some other Observations.</P>
<P>It is for certain, the Receptacle of divers <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Transports, who will, or now can comply with the <HI>Geneva,</HI> though not with the <HI>London</HI> Presbytery, forsooth it is here in purity, and hath not contracted the Pride and Covetousness of our Rabbies. But among the rest, here is that <HI>Illustrious Nothing,</HI> or at least here he was not long since, who was knaved into, and was fooled out of, his ridiculous Usurpation in <HI>England,</HI> I mean <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> the eldest Son of the late <HI>Oli∣ver;</HI> the Town he guessed could not but be civil to him, for the great Expence his Fathers 3. Com∣missioners, Mr. <HI>Pel.</HI> &amp;c. made here about the Composition of the <HI>Piedmont</HI> Troubles, and out of respect to the Moneys which was deposited in their hands. How he lived here is not discovera∣ble, for privacy hath enveloped the fond Glories of this short reign'd Usurper, and obscurity is the best foyl to this once glittering Pibble; but enough of this example to ambitious wretches.</P>
<P>And here out of hand is to be formed, as it was most ingenuously and aptly represented, a huge Army, in aid and assistance of the <HI>Turk,</HI> who will publiquely profess the Religion hereof, as agree∣ing best with that Tyrannical Goverment. But to proceed.</P>
<P>This Religion was introduced by <HI>Calvin,</HI> 1541. the summ whereof was this, <HI>viz.</HI> All Ministers to
<PB N="122" REF="71"/>be equally great amongst themselves. 2. Lay∣men out of the People to be joyned unto every Minister, and these were called <HI>Elders;</HI> the Mi∣nisters to continue for term of Life in this power, but the Elders to be chosen every year, which was very grateful to the Burgers, who hoped each of them to come to the Administration of the Ecclesi∣astical Authority; these, together with other Pa∣rish Elders, being met together, to be called the Presbytery, and to have power of Ordination, Excommunication, and Absolution, and what∣ever else was done by their Bishop in times before, whom he made the <HI>Genevois</HI> utterly to abjure, and to receve this Platform as sent from Heaven. But — Nevertheless the People did not long like it; but <HI>Calvin,</HI> by his Authority, and the awe of the Canton of <HI>Zurich,</HI> kept it rigidly up, du∣ring his life time; after which, the succeeding Ministers allowed the People the use of all man∣like Exercises in the Morning, and intervalls of Divine Service, which something mitigated the Humour, and, like the <HI>Roman</HI> Sports, took them off from quarrelling with their Ministers.</P>
<P>What they are like to do against the <HI>Turk,</HI> the Passage above-mentioned declares; 'twas <HI>Luther</HI> that gave admittance, I mean his Reformation, to the <HI>Turk</HI> to invade <HI>Christendom;</HI> that is to say, he took advantage of those Divisions that reigned then; and it may be now said, that the troubles in the <HI>Roman</HI> temporal Estate, have engaged him, which the <HI>Romanists</HI> lay all upon the Heretique, so that it comes to this Door at last, or they will leave it there. In fine, They are able to do no∣thing,
<PB N="123" REF="71"/>and are the only Snayls in <HI>Europe.</HI> They are confederate with the Canton of <HI>Bearn,</HI> but 'tis for their security.</P>

<HEAD>Switzerland.</HEAD>
<P>IN our passage from <HI>Geneva</HI> to the <HI>Switzers,</HI> lyeth a Country called <HI>Wallisland,</HI> governed by a Catholick Bishop, and leagued with the 7. Ca∣tholick Cantons: They are divided into 7. Re∣sorts, and 2. Districts or Provinces; the lower, and the upper; they lye included betwixt Moun∣tains, out of which they seldom issue, and there∣fore we bid adieu to them, and make way to their Neighbours.</P>
<P><HI>SWITZERLAND</HI> is bounded on the West with Mount <HI>Jour,</HI> and Lake <HI>Leman;</HI> on the North with <HI>Swevia</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> on the South with <HI>Wallisland,</HI> and the <HI>Alps;</HI> and on the East with the <HI>Grisons,</HI> and part of <HI>Tirol</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> It is reported to stand upon the highest ground in <HI>Christendom,</HI> yet hath it plenty of Rivers, which it dispenseth in the greatest Chanels through the mightiest Provinces of <HI>Europe.</HI> It hath many Lakes, and abundance of fresh, and excellent good Fish, by which Lakes and Rivers there is
<PB N="124" REF="72"/>good passage and conveyance; there are also Medows, as pleasant, and as eminent for their fer∣tility, as their Mountains are prominent, rough and sterile. The whole Country contains in length 240. Miles, and in bredth 180. The Peo∣ple rude and Military, as all Mountainers use to be.</P>
<P>They were once under the Government of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> as Earls of <HI>Halspurg,</HI> the Castle whereof is standing in this Country, which gave Original and Title to that Family, but rising for their Liberty, provoked by the Rape of one of their Daughters, they, by 2. terrible Defeats given the <HI>Austrians,</HI> shook off their Yoak; and immediately 3. Cantons combined in a League, with which, after some Ages or Years, all the 13. entred, and in which they now continue. The first thing they did in the beginning of this Confe∣deracy, was to root out all the Gentry, and not leave a remain of them, as those that were the In∣struments of their slavery under the <HI>Austrians:</HI> So that no man there pretends to be gentilely de∣scended, for thereby he is made uncapable of any Office in the Common-wealth; yet there are some noble Spirits, that prefer their blood to such slo∣venly Magistracies, where the Butcher, and the Shooe maker takes his turn in the Government, and is in his Town the supreme Ruler, and to this module they yet keep.</P>
<P>Their Exemption of themselves in this manner from the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> made them notable in the World, which they were not since <HI>Julius Cae∣sar;</HI> but their defeat and slaughter of <HI>Charles</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="72"/>Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and their renue for the Duke of <HI>Millain</HI> against the <HI>French,</HI> made them terrible and famous; until finding their own strength, they began to play fast and loose with their Confe∣derates, and to become open Mercenaries, losing <HI>Millain,</HI> which they had preserved, and serving the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> King, the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and others, at the same time, under certain secret Pensions, which the chief Counsellours do receive at this day; so that all the Honour that is left them (which they might have blazoned by many Conquests upon their Neighbours) is borrowed from their attendance as Guards to the Person of the <HI>French</HI> King; and Sedan-men, or some such Office about the Pope. Nevertheless, it is to be confessed, that they are very good Infantry, and will stand a shock firm, and in good order, which is a main security to the <HI>French</HI> Foot, that can hardly endure an easie impression.</P>
<P>Their Government at home is divided into 3. Members: 1. The 13. Cantons, being 7. Ro∣man, and 6. Protestant. 2. The States and Cities confederate, as the Abbot of St. <HI>Gall, Multiuse,</HI> a free City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And lastly, The Praefectures, or several Lordships and Towns, which they pos∣sess in the <HI>Alps,</HI> in the Dutchy of <HI>Millain,</HI> &amp;c. which are a distinct part of the Common-wealth, but are subject to the Cantons, and obey their Decrees (without any Vote in their Councils) as Subjects; and of these Towns and Lordships they have some number, which yields the best of their Revenue. The Regiment or Magistracy is altogether Popular, and consists in a Great Coun∣cil,
<PB N="126" REF="73"/>summoned upon any great and emergent Oc∣casion; and yet the particular Cities, and Re∣sorts, or Hundreds, in number 148. are govern∣ed by one Officer. So hath every Canton a su∣preme Mastistrate, called the <HI>Ungman,</HI> or single Person, who is assisted with a Council in Cases of Importance. The Diets are held commonly at <HI>Baden,</HI> for the beauty and commodiousness of the Place, where all things concerning Peace and War, Embassies, Leagues, and the like, are alwayes determined.</P>
<P>Their Revenue is very inconsiderable, for having no Commerce with Strangers, they have no Customes, nor have they any Manufactures. Cutlery is a great Trade. What they raise is by Impost upon Wine, and those Taxes laid upon their Prefectures, whom yet they use very ten∣derly; besides, the yearly Pensions they receive from the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> are brought into the publick Treasury, save what comes pri∣vately into the hands of the Grandees, and those that manage the State, one of the greatest ble∣mishes and prejudices to their State; but as 'tis no shame to be mercenary in the Field, so 'tis no blame to be a Mercenary in Council.</P>
<P>As to their Force, it far excceds their Revenue, for upon occasion, they can bring 30. thousand Foot into the Field, besides what the confederate Cities will add thereunto: As for Horse, they are of no use in those hilly Countries, nor a quar∣ter of the number of the Foot, to defend a Region so impregnable; and they have no ambition, as we have mentioned before, of invading others.
<PB N="127" REF="73"/>And if there should happen a Division, and Quar∣rel should arise betwixt the Cantons, as lately there did, and that to Armes, such Forces are on∣ly requisite as may oppose the numbers of the ad∣verse Party, for they cannot march in great Bo∣dies; and, as I remember, there were not 3000. Men engaged on either side in the late Difference; Fights are there by hundreds, and twenties, for few more have room to combat.</P>
<P>But what they want at home, they have in the wide World; they are now in the service of the <HI>French, Venetian, Spaniard,</HI> and <HI>Genoise,</HI> whose Dukes Guards likewise they are; and they are raising 6000. more Foot for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> against the <HI>Portuguez,</HI> among the Catholique Cantons, if the late Broyl do not hinder the Levy. But not a word all this while of any Forces for the Em∣perour, so true is their usual Proverb; — <HI>Non point L'argent, non point</HI> Swisse, No Money, no <HI>Swisse;</HI> besides they no way affect the House of <HI>Austria:</HI> and their late solemn Embassy of 30. of their Sages, and their no less magnificent recepti∣on in <HI>France,</HI> with more Ceremony and Punctilios than was ever used towards them before, doth ar∣gue some Intrigue that way, but what Time must be tell troth; nor care for his service, or regard his distresses; what ever betides him, they are secure by their Mountains; and there we must leave them, for the <HI>Turk,</HI> if Victorious, to look up to.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>GRISONS.</HI> OR THE Valtoline.</HEAD>
<P>THis is another Member of the 5. which make up the Estates of the <HI>Alps,</HI> and the Duke thereof formerly the first Duke of the Empire. They are a Common-wealth, seated in more ab∣rupt Ground, yet enjoying as fruitful Valleys as any of the rest, and as good Wine growing there∣in. By Religion generally Protestants, and con∣federate with the Cantons of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and, like them, divided into 3. Leagues or Shires, con∣siderable for nothing more, than that they are a Passage for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> from <HI>Millain</HI> to <HI>Germany,</HI> and so contrarily, which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> secured, and thereupon, in 1623. happened a War in this place, the <HI>French,</HI> and Confederates, forcing the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to a Treaty, whereby nevertheless, in the lieu of <HI>Sondrio,</HI> a pleasant and strong Province, the Town and Castle being of that name also, he enjoyes the Fort <HI>Fuentes,</HI> he built, and hath still
<PB N="129" REF="74"/>a passage open to <HI>Germany,</HI> but <HI>Millain</HI> being to supply another War another way, there is no oc∣casion to speak farther of these <HI>Grisons.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SAVOY.</HEAD>
<P>THis Noble Dutchy of <HI>Savoy</HI> is another, and the principal Member of these States of the <HI>Alps,</HI> and though we have not given it praece∣dence in this Transition, yet it justly claimes it, but our design was to mention it in our way to <HI>Italy,</HI> and to place it before that most excellent Region, and those Soveraignties and Principali∣ties which better aspect it, than the uncouch rudenesses of those Mountainous Common-wealths.</P>
<P>It is bounded on the West with <HI>Daulphine;</HI> on the South with <HI>Province,</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> on the East with <HI>Millain</HI> and <HI>Montferrat;</HI> on the North with <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and the Lake <HI>Leman;</HI> and is divided into 2. Members, <HI>Savoy,</HI> properly so called, and <HI>Piedmont;</HI> the later of these is the most noble, as wherein stands <HI>Turin,</HI> the Dukes Residence, and wherein are abundance of Marqui∣sates, and other noble Titles, and their Mansions, a number of Towns, and as well built and fortified,
<PB N="130" REF="75"/>but better peopled; famous also for the Valley of <HI>Ast,</HI> and for one of the strongest Fortifications in the World, <HI>viz. Nizze,</HI> a Sea-Port, which be∣fore it had any Walls finished, baffled and baulked the famous <HI>Turkish Barbarossa,</HI> called in by the <HI>French</HI> King, against <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. with 200. Galleys, but now it is impregnable. The vulgar <HI>Savoyards</HI> are naturally stupid, and no way given to Military affairs, but the Gentlemen of excel∣lent Address, as are the Citizens, and many of the middle sort.</P>
<P>This Duke is indeed Master of a fine Country, and a good People; the Country of a large extent, and the people of a large Heart and Liberal Hand to their Prince, when upon occasion he demands supplies, especially the <HI>Piedmontese;</HI> for besides his ordinary revenue, which some have reckoned at 400000 <HI>l. sterling,</HI> he usually doubles it by im∣positions upon his Subjects, if he increases it not beyond that proportion.</P>
<P>And he had need of a good Revenue; for he hath a number of Garrisons, both Frontire, Mid∣land, and Maritime to maintain, out of which in Field service he is forced to draw his Army, al∣though he is served voluntarily by the Gentry, who with their retinnue and attendants do furnish out his Troops. This Prince assumes to himself the style and title of his <HI>Royal Highness,</HI> as King of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and will have his Ambassa∣dours treated as the Ministers of <HI>a Teste Couronne,</HI> and to be placed and received like them, which hath of late times been admitted in most Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> although scrupled by the <HI>Venetian, Hol∣lander,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="75"/>
<P>As to his Interest in the World, he appears very considerable, both the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI> willing to be his Friend, and his Concern is to be neutral to them both, as his mighty and potent Neighbours on both sides his Dominions; He sided in this last War with the <HI>French,</HI> but 'twas by reason of his marriage with <HI>Christiana,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King's Sister; as when coupled with <HI>Spain,</HI> he engaged there: But formerly these Dukes were constant Sticklers for the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> but it is judged that the <HI>French</HI> Friendship is more ne∣cessary and safe for this Dutchy, not only by the Event of the late War, whereby he hath all re∣stored him in the general Treaty: but also as to the present Juncture, and the likely aspect of fu∣ture Affairs: But to proceed.</P>
<P>This Duke is challenged as a Feudatory and Feif of the Empire, but he cannot of late be drawn to acknowledge it, although <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. rein∣stated one of these Dukes, after he was despoyled in his quarrel by the <HI>French</HI> King; and though it is alleged, they were first invested by the Empe∣rours in these Dominions, and upon this account he exempts himself from any Subsidy or Aid to be given the Emperour, but he pleads a Release of all Feifs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so <HI>sub judice lis est.</HI> At pre∣sent there is no noise of any Preparations for that Expedition, the Court being in mourning for the death of the Dutchess Royal, the Mother of the present Duke. There have been some late broyls about the Protestants of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> for the old Grudge, heightned by that mischief-maker <HI>Oliver,</HI> in those stout-hearted people, but by his Majesties
<PB N="132" REF="76"/>prudent intercession, the Duke hath acquiesced, and they have composed themselves without any Stir or Articles: And so we pass hence to <HI>MILLAIN.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MILLAIN.</HEAD>
<P>IT is bounded on the West with <HI>Piedmont,</HI> on the East with <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Parma,</HI> South with a great ridge of Hills, called the <HI>Apennine,</HI> and North with the <HI>Marca.</HI> This Dukedom yet the first in <HI>Europe</HI> for Dignity, was piece-mealed by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> the <HI>Florentine, Mantuan,</HI> and o∣thers, while it was in Contest, and embroyled by Pretenders. It is the Garden of <HI>Italy,</HI> and for the delights and pleasures thereof so striven for by <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in whose possession it now is. It's Revenue is computed worth 300. thousand Pound a Year, but that never served to defray the Expence of the Government during the War, by reason of the number of Garrisons that were con∣stantly maintained, but since the Peace it yields some advantage to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> As to the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> this Province is the ready way for the Forces of <HI>Spain</HI> to march for the relief of the Empire, but instead thereof, such Forces as
<PB N="133" REF="76"/>can be made ready, are bending the other way, to the Sea coast, to be embarqued for the War in <HI>Portugall;</HI> so that the House of <HI>Austria</HI> is mainly disappointed of their great support, in a very fatal Juncture: And so much for <HI>Millain.</HI></P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>MANTUA.</HEAD>
<P>IT is bounded and surrounded with <HI>Millain</HI> on the West, <HI>Romandiola,</HI> the <HI>Marca,</HI> and <HI>Parma,</HI> seized from a tyrannical Lord thereof, by <HI>Lewis de Gonzaga,</HI> in a tumult at <HI>Mantua,</HI> and conferred upon him afterwards by the Empe∣rour, and in his Family this Dignity continues: The <HI>Spantard,</HI> and the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the 2d. made opposition, and would not admit of the Duke of <HI>Nevers</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the next Heir to the deceased Duke, but <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13th. although en∣gaged in the <HI>Rochel</HI> business, by an Army sent in∣to <HI>Italy,</HI> relieved <HI>Casal</HI> distressed by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who had spoyled <HI>Mantua,</HI> and stated the Duke in quiet possession; which brave and admired Enter∣prise, was worthily reckoned as one of the great Actions of that King.</P>
<P>The Territory of this Duke is very large, but
<PB N="134" REF="77"/>his Revenue not so great as amounting to 230. thousand Pound sterling. He is the next Prince in Dominion to the <HI>Florentine,</HI> but more easie to his Subjects, for he might improve his Exchequer by Imposts, but either the danger, or the un∣customariness of the thing, makes him forbear it: Besides, he hath no Trade, nor Sea-Ports, as the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Duke, being altogether inland; but with this Intrado he lives like a Prince indeed, though, like the rest of the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> they have scarce a Foot of Land of their own. As to the <HI>Turkish</HI> War, the Princes of this Territory were farr readier, as were all the rest of the Feudatories of the Empire, to assist the <HI>Germans,</HI> than now they are; for <HI>William,</HI> one of those Dukes, in Person, with 2000.

He hath no Piques or Feuds any where, but is a Prince of very great Esteem and Reputation, and allianced with the best Families in <HI>Europe,</HI> and yet he is less in Demesn, and per∣haps Interest, having lately sold to the deceased Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> his Dutchy of <HI>Nevers,</HI> of which before in <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>THese 2. little Dutchies are situate in that great and fertile Territory once called <HI>Lom∣bardy,</HI> as are all these we have mentioned hi∣therto, and were assigned by <HI>Clement</HI> the 8th. to <HI>Caesar de Este,</HI> the Grand-son, by a Bastard, to <HI>Alphonso</HI> the last Duke of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> in lieu of his claim or pretence to that Dutchy; the Pope with an Army of 20000. Foot, and 2000. Horse, perswades the Duke to accept of these Conditions of the Exchange, with this clause also, that he should acknowledge the Pope as his supreme Lord, and therewithall he seized the said Dutchy and City of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> as an Escheat to the Church.</P>
<P>Now although this be a small Dutchy, yet are the Dukes of good Renown, especially the last, who approved himself an excellent Captain in the late War betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> on the behalf of <HI>France,</HI> which procured that match between the now Duke <HI>Alphonso,</HI> and one of the Cardinals beloved Neeces, and whom he dowried well, and hath legacied her in the same manner. By the late Treaty between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="78"/>the <HI>Spaniard</HI> is reconciled unto him, at the in∣stance of the <HI>French</HI> King, and both Kings joyntly are to use their endeavours and supplications with his Holiness the Pope, for the restitution of the Valleys of <HI>Comachio</HI> to him, of which such often mention hath been made in the publick week Books.</P>
<P>This <HI>Comachio</HI> is a District of Marish Ground for the most part, lying in the Dutchy of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> and was formerly the Title of the House of <HI>Este,</HI> before they had that of <HI>Ferrara</HI> given them by the Emperour, and was their proper demesne Estate and Inheritance; now when <HI>Clement</HI> the 8. pos∣sessed himself of this Dutchy, and agreed by Treaty that all Lands, or what properly belonged to the said Family of <HI>Este,</HI> he notwithstanding seized upon this Estate, with the rest, without any di∣stinction; and hereupon Complaints have since been made to the Apostolical Chamber, rein∣forced by the instances of the <HI>French</HI> King, in which he hath engaged the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and lately made it a Pique against his Holiness.</P>
<P>This Duke, like the rest of the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> desires to be at peace, and live in quiet, nor to see no Armes in <HI>Italy,</HI> now enjoying a serene tranquillity, after a most tedious harassing War; He is fast in the embraces of his beautiful Lady, and will hardly arm himself like his Predecessor in the Emperours Cause, some supplyes he may chance to send him of Money, and do as his Neighbours that are Feifs of the Empire like him∣self; and some Moneys the Emperour hath had al∣ready from some of the Princes; but he cannot be

<P>THis Dukedom is bounded on the South with the <HI>Apennine,</HI> North with <HI>Millain,</HI> East with <HI>Modena,</HI> West with <HI>Montferrat.</HI> Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the 3d. of the Family of the <HI>Farnese,</HI> gave this Dut∣chy to his bastard Son <HI>Petro Luigi,</HI> and in lieu thereof, and recompence to the Church, assign∣ed to it the Dutchy of <HI>Camerone,</HI> situate in the Dutchy of <HI>Urbin;</HI> but he proving a most vicious debauch'd Person, was assassinated, and his Son <HI>Octavian</HI> forced to guard himself in <HI>Parma;</HI> whi∣ther soon after came <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. in Person, and besieged him, although he had married his base Daughter <HI>Margaret,</HI> afterwards Governess of the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> to the relief hereof came the <HI>French</HI> King, and a 4. years VVar ensued, for <HI>Charles</HI> was resolved to ruine his Son in Law: but he resigning, <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. to disoblige him from the <HI>French,</HI> not only proffered him his Friendship, but gave him the Dukedom of <HI>Placentia</HI> in <HI>Millain,</HI> although for the present he kept the Citadel with a Garrison of his own; but afterwards, in recom∣pence
<PB N="139" REF="79"/>of the great services of <HI>Alexander,</HI> Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> he not only withdrew that Garrison, but added to his Estate the Territory of <HI>Novara</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince layes also claim to the Dutchy of <HI>Camerone,</HI> and much sollicited the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> aided therein also by the mediation of the <HI>French</HI> King, who continues to afflagitate the same things to this day, as a main Concern of his own, as in which he hath so far engaged himself, and his ho∣nour, and vogued it as a part of his Quarrel, that it is supposed, he will not recede without some∣thing done in it, in the Conclusion of this magni∣ficent Business at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Dutchy of <HI>Parma</HI> it self is considerable for its Revenue, but the best part of it, and more, is expended upon Garrisons, being surrounded on all hands with the Estates of other Princes; not to mention other Charges of the Government. He is a good VViller to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> as their Ally and Kinsman, and will advance what he can, but the narrowness of his Fortune is a Clog to his Affection; besides, the petty Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> live to the heighth of their Revenue, to make themselves seem more considerable than they are: And so we pass to the Papal Dominions, or Ecclesiastical STATE.</P>

<P>IT is dis-joyned West from <HI>Naples,</HI> South-west from <HI>Florence,</HI> North-west from <HI>Venice,</HI> and lyes North and South cross from the <HI>Adriatick</HI> to the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Sea, broad 100. long 300. Miles; a fair advantage and opportunity to the Lords there∣of, either for enlargement of Empire, or increase and improvement of Trade; but the Popes are not much for Force, since they can effect more by Fraud; and the <HI>Romans</HI> retaining the humour of their old Ancestors, will not bargain and traf∣fique, nor follow any Trade, as a sordid and vile life; but this Pride is accompanied with a generous Courage, and they are generally daring Spirits, and reputed the best Souldiers in <HI>Italy;</HI> for which reason they are invited frequently to forein Com∣mands, which they discharge with great Reputa∣tion.</P>
<P>The Estate of the Pope is of 2. sorts, the one consisteth in Temporal Dominion, the other in
<PB N="141" REF="80"/>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction: His Temporal Domi∣nion is divided likewise into 2. sorts, the one im∣mediate, which yields a Revenue, the other me∣diate, which is holden in Fee of the Church; of the first kind, are St. <HI>Peters</HI> Patrimony, <HI>Avignion</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> &amp;c. of the latter, <HI>Naples,</HI> &amp;c. The immediate Temporal Estate consists of 7. Mem∣bers, <HI>Romandialo, Ferrara,</HI> with <HI>Urbin, Mar∣ca Anconitana,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Spoleto,</HI> St. <HI>Peters</HI> Patrimony, and <HI>Campagna de Roma.</HI> 1. <HI>Roman∣diola,</HI> famous for the City and University of <HI>Bo∣nonia,</HI> or <HI>Bologna,</HI> and the <HI>Exarchate</HI> of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> once the Seat of Emperours, and extorted by the Popes from the <HI>Venetians</HI> in former times, with some other adjacent Territories, and made Holy Ground. 2. <HI>Ferrara,</HI> in which the Valley of <HI>Commachio</HI> aforesaid, a brave Dominion, and worthy the state and splendour of the Papacy, both for Revenue, Delight and Fertility. 3. <HI>Urbin,</HI> in it the Dutchy of <HI>Camerone,</HI> belonging, as a∣bove-said, to the Duke of <HI>Parma; Urbin</HI> is 60. Miles in length, 35. in bredth, and yields 100000. Crowns Revenue. 4. <HI>Marca Anconitana,</HI> in which stands the famous Chapel of our Lady of <HI>Lo∣retto,</HI> one of the notable Sights of <HI>Italy.</HI> 5. <HI>Spo∣leto,</HI> the old Demesne of the Church. 6. St. <HI>Peters</HI> Patrimony, lying in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> and given to the Church many Centuries since by Pope <HI>Pas∣chal.</HI> 7. <HI>Campagna de Roma,</HI> wherein <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Mistress</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> is seated; and the Pope presides with as much Empire and Authority as any of the <HI>Roman Caesars,</HI> by what means it is too tedi∣ous and unnecessary to relate, the Story of it being
<PB N="142" REF="81"/>so publick in many Prints; for which reason also we shall pass the manner of the Election of Popes, of the College of Cardinals, of the Consistory, and whatever concerns the Civil Polity of that prudent and subtile Government, because we will not nauseate the Reader.</P>
<P>The ordinary Temporal Revenue of the Eccle∣siastical Dominions is 2. Millions of Crowns, and for the Spiritual Intrado, its a Mystery, or a Mi∣racle, for all <HI>Luthers</HI> Execrations against Indul∣gencies, and the wiser Worlds Discovery; yet is their Exchequer mostly empty, the reasons whereof are reputed to be the great Pomp and Magnificence of the Popes, in their Vesture, and the Ornament of their Persons, their vast Allow∣ances to their Nuncioes, and Legates, (when ex∣traordinary Occasions happen) and other Intelli∣gencers and Spies in the Courts of Princes, but of late the Jesuites have saved that Expence.</P>
<P>As to the Force and Power of this Potentate, it hath been greater than now it is, yet still he had the misfortune in any Quarrel to be worsted, if left to himself, I mean in the defensive part; for how oft hath <HI>Rome</HI> been sackt, and the Popes changed and imprisoned? But as a <HI>Specimen</HI> of what Armies they can raise, set us consider, that <HI>Clement</HI> the 8th. had 20000. Foot, and 2000. Horse, to the reduction of the Dutchy of <HI>Ferra∣ra;</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> the 3d. in the League betwixt him, the Emperour, and the <HI>Venetians,</HI> against the Pro∣testants, bore the sixth part of the Charges of that War; Against the Protestants, and in aid of <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. he sent 12000. Footmen, and
<PB N="143" REF="81"/>500. Horsemen, bearing their Charges during the War. This man was he that advanced his House to that Honour wherein it continueth to this day in <HI>Florence. Pius</HI> the 5th. aided <HI>Charles</HI> the 9th. of <HI>France,</HI> with 5000. Footmen, and a 1000. Horsemen: And <HI>Xistus</HI> the 5th. raked together in the 5. years and a half of his Pontificy, 5. Milli∣ons of Crowns, and expended magnificently not∣withstanding, in bringing Water-Pipes, and e∣recting Conduits in the City, with Pyramids, Pa∣laces, and other sumptuous Buildings, Churches, and Porticoes. This Money so left in the Trea∣sury, was immediately squandered away by the succeeding Pope; such is the successive variation of Humour and Temper of these Potentates, that men imagine they do purposely run Counter to one anothers designs</P>
<P>This considered, the Papacy seems in this pre∣sent condition to goe below it self; the Pope one of the Prudentest that ever sate in the Chair, all things composed, Money enough, but (<HI>hinc il∣lae Lachrymae</HI>) <HI>No Friends,</HI> or Backers. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> are very tenacious of their Forms, and its supposed they will be now held to one, the untunable Recantation of their Injury to the <HI>French.</HI> The Pomp and Triumph of the Legates Entry is intended to dazle the eyes of his good Ca∣tholiques, and the Affair is excellently well cloathed, but the World sees the nakedness of it; and that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath not this first time yielded to the will of her Sons, like a kind and in∣dulgent Mother, when her Chastisements cannot reach them. In the mean time her bosome hath
<PB N="144" REF="82"/>been opened to her eldest Child the Emperour of <HI>Germany,</HI> and she raised her Levies to his assist∣ance to the same proportion as the forwardest; and without question hath not been wanting either in her Advice or Purse.</P>

<P>The great Maximes they proceed upon are these.</P>
<P N="1">1. To be Umpires and Spectators in the trou∣bles of the World, rather than Actors; to em∣broyl all other States, and say, as their Motto, <HI>Pax tibi Marte;</HI> none being more reputed for their open Intercessions for Peace, none more suspected for their clandestine Incitations to a War; for as they <HI>stole</HI> at <HI>first,</HI> so they must <HI>stand</HI> at <HI>last,</HI> a Republique only, because of the com∣mon troubles; But being addicted to Peace, Tra∣fique, Wealth, and Repose, the first and fun∣damental Maxim they propose to themselves, is, to maintain common freedom, and live secure.</P>
<P N="2">2. To ballance the Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> keeping them all out of <HI>Italy:</HI> In pursuit of which Princi∣ple, many have been its Contests with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> being as famous for varying Coun∣sell, Alliancies, Dependencies abroad, as for keeping close to her Constitution and Government at home; where the Rule is, the <HI>Venetians</HI> deli∣berate long before they decree any thing, but when it is once seriously decreed, it is as ir∣revocable as the Laws of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per∣sians.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To understand all the <HI>Intrigues</HI> of <HI>Europe;</HI> whence it is that they observe this method in the
<PB N="148" REF="84"/>Employment of their Ambassadors: First, They send a man to <HI>Switzerland,</HI> thence they employ him in <HI>Holland,</HI> from thence they transmit him to <HI>England,</HI> and from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> from <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>Germany,</HI> and from <HI>Germany</HI> to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and are said to expend 140000 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> in Intelligen∣cies.</P>
<P N="4">4. To keep their People in a perfect state of Obedience, alwayes <HI>ignorant</HI> how to <HI>dispute,</HI> al∣ways<HI> knowing</HI> how to <HI>obey</HI> their Superiours Or∣ders, which they will endure no Jesuite, or any other. Ecclesiasticks, to discourse, or cavil at; and therefore are out with the Court, rather than Church of <HI>Rome</HI> most commonly, because it pro∣pagates a Religion that is so prejudicial to the In∣terest of Government, and the Peace of Common-wealth; insomuch that I find applyed to <HI>Venice</HI> what the Historian saith of <HI>Lacedaemonia, Diù ste∣tit, non quod Rex benè imperabat, sed quia Populus benè parebat:</HI> It lasted so long, not so much be∣cause the Prince did command well, as because the People did obey so.</P>
<P N="5">5. To make use of the <HI>French</HI> Power to check the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> to check the <HI>French</HI> in their Encroachments upon <HI>Italy,</HI> and both to watch the Popes, since they have been transport∣ed: by their own interest, to neglect or betray the common good.</P>
<P N="6">6. To admit neither Churchmen nor Women into her secular Council, the one being subject to their own humours, and the second to others, I mean those of the Pontifical Interest; advancing
<PB N="149" REF="84"/>none that have a forein relation in her domestick service; keeping likewise a watchful eye over Priests and Pulpits, that none, from the meanest Frier, to the highest Patriarch, meddle with the Transactions and Designs of the Senate, upon pain of the severest punishments: Only that State hath 2. very eminent men, the one a sound Di∣vine, the other a learned Casuist, alwayes in Pension, and ready; in case of any Contest about excentrick and irregular proceedings of <HI>Rome,</HI> to defend and vindicate her by publick writing, as <HI>Padre Paulo</HI> did <HI>Anno</HI> 1612.</P>
<P N="7">7. To entertain for Generals and Souldiers, whom, when she loseth she misseth not, when she hath finished her War, she dischargeth, to a∣void Expence on the one hand, and Faction on the other, which are usual in Common-wealths, where the Members are advanced to too high an Employment; to which purpose, she puts such restraints to the Power of her Duke, and the Ri∣ches of her Nobility, that neither can attempt or maintain any Design prejudicial to the publick In∣terest.</P>
<P N="8">8. Yet to encourage any Person that shall find out or invent any thing that may tend either to her advantage or honour, as suitably with rewards, as they punish those that attempt or conspire any thing against them agreeably with punishments; every Design against the Government there being Death without mercy, as is the revealing of the least secrets from the Council of State; whence it is a part of every forein Ambassadors instruction, not to entertain conference with any Senator in
<PB N="150" REF="85"/>private, it being a matter of an implacable jea∣lousie in that Republique, where no Senator re∣ceives a Pension from any forein Ambassador, nor Ambassador any gratuity from any forein Prince, save what they openly acknowledge, and bestow upon the Treasury of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> of late grown a Proverb for <HI>Riches,</HI> as the <HI>Arsenal</HI> is for <HI>Strength.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. To which you may add, that the <HI>Venetians</HI> are so good and publick-spirited Patriots, that every Galley that goeth out in course, thinks she hath <HI>Venice</HI> her self aboard her, every mans care being <HI>Ne quid Respublica detrimenti capiat:</HI> And every man is as grave and as silent as the Duke, owning a slowness of apprehension abundantly recompenced by the exactness of their judge∣ment.</P>
<P N="10">10.

<P>Its Interest seemeth to be as much limited as its Situation, for it hath but 6. things to do: <HI>First,</HI> To exclude the Nobility, and keep the Common∣wealth <HI>even,</HI> by a restraint upon all Excesses of Power, Riches, Honour, or Popularity. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI> To assist with Men, and Money, in all the Wars round about them, at that rate maintain∣ing their own Peace. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To be the Bank of <HI>Spain,</HI> and other Kingdomes, where they take Money at that excessive rate, that the Revenues of <HI>Millain</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> goe to pay Use Money; the Common-wealth of <HI>Genoa</HI> so obliging the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> more to its self, than all the Powers of <HI>En∣rope</HI> could do: Though <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. and his Son <HI>Philip,</HI> thought, by borrowing their Money, to weaken, and engage them rather to himself; which they might do the better, since <HI>France</HI> at∣tempted the reducement of the <HI>Seignory</HI> to its old Yoak, shaken off 1528. by <HI>Augustine Flisci,</HI> and his Family, who seized their Navy, slew their Captain <HI>John Dorya;</HI> but leaping from one Gal∣ley to another, to secure all, stumbled and fell in∣to the Sea, where he, and his ambitious Treasons, were both drowned together. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> To keep 12000.

<PB N="158" REF="90"/>Protector of <HI>Spain;</HI> which they may well main∣tain, considering their Revenue amounteth to no less than 44000. Crowns <HI>per Annum,</HI> besides their Bank of St. <HI>George,</HI> the most famous in the World, whose original, growth, use, and in∣fluence is thus.</P>
<P><HI>When the untoward War between the</HI> Genoese, <HI>and the</HI> Venetians, <HI>was at an end, and the</HI> Genoese <HI>could not pay their Debts, they assigned over first their Taxes, and after that their Revenue and De∣main, to such private Citizens hands as were their Creditors; who electing among themselves a Common-Council of an hundred, with</HI> 8. <HI>Officers over them, managed this</HI> Intrado <HI>and</HI> Stock <HI>so orderly, that they became at last possessed of most of the Common∣wealth; the Towns and Territories whereof they go∣vern by Officers chosen by their own common suffrage; insomuch, that the common People, in all times of Dissentions, stick to St.</HI> George, <HI>regarding no Faction any otherwise, than in relation to that Bank; to which they require all Parties to swear faithfulness. This prevailing over the rest of the Republique, be∣cause it hath no changing of Officers, and the other being subject to that Inconvenience, their Duke, his</HI> 8. <HI>Assistants, and</HI> 400. <HI>Gentlemen, that is their Mayor, Alderman, and Common-Council, being changed every two year, so that they are out of their Places before they know to what end they are in.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Corsica,</HI> an Island 120. Miles long, and 7. broad, 60. Mile from <HI>Genoa,</HI> and 6. from <HI>Sardinia;</HI> first won by the <HI>Genoese</HI> from the <HI>Pisans,</HI> next by the <HI>French</HI> from the <HI>Genoese,</HI> and since restored upon the Peace between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> 1557. For securing whereof for the future to this Com∣mon-wealth, my Author tells me, they fell upon this handsome Project, emplying none but natural <HI>Genoese</HI> to serve in the Garrisons of the Island, the better to keep under this rude and untractable Peo∣ple. <HI>And filling all their Garrisons upon the</HI> Conti∣nent <HI>with natural</HI> Corsicans, <HI>whereby the Island is unfurnished of its ablest men, who also serve for Ho∣stages of the publick Faith. It is the destiny of Princes and States, who are little in themselves, or who have but a moderate strength. Its a pittiful thing to see to what Necessity the petty Princes are re∣duced
<PB N="161" REF="92"/>to maintain themselves, how many real Evills they are exposed to, to conserve that vain Image of Liberty, and that sweet Illusion of that Soveraign Authority that doth bewitch them. In Expences they consume themselves for their defence, and al∣most give all that might be taken from them, that nothing might be taken from them. They are obliged to observe all the Fancies and Motions of their Ene∣mies and Friends; and if they subsist, 'tis not by their strength, because they have none, but by their weakness, and because their Countries are of so little Concernment, that they beget not a desire in ambitious Persons, nor that Justice should be violated in the Conquest of them: Or they are under shelter from the Enterprizes of the one, by the Jealousie of the other; and preserve their Liberty, for that the Ambitious hinder one another to seize upon them, and to become the Masters.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. But since men will rather aspire to the shad∣dow of a troublesome Freedome, than live in the easiest depenidence, and in the most commodious subjection in the World, the Interest of such men is, to provide for the first Onset of an Enemy, on their own Charge; it being better to spend themselves, than be over-run by strangers; and a wasted Country being more Eligible than an en∣dangered one by Auxiliaries, most commonly ad∣judged, in little Common-wealths, worse than Enemies; and though the Charge be excessive, yet either the Assailant is tyred to an Accom∣modation, or, which is the great happiness of weak States, they have time to settle their Correspondence abroad, so as it may check their
<PB N="162" REF="93"/>Enemies, and not endanger themselves.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their Provisions must be timely out of the hazard of surprizes, inconveniencies that have befallen the Enemies of these men, the <HI>Vene∣tian,</HI> both in the business of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Cre∣mona.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Their Friends must be employed, rather to divert their Enemies, by an Inroad upon their In∣terest, or Country, than to help them: by laying waste their own. Its fitter the Pope should <HI>quar∣rel</HI> with the <HI>Venetians</HI> in <HI>Venice,</HI> than <HI>fight</HI> with them in <HI>Genoa.</HI> Assistants are Physicians which cannot cure an ill Humour, without that alterati∣on and disorder, which leaves a worse Impression sometimes after it, than the Disease that went be∣fore it: Neither is it to be doubted, but the de∣sign of diversion will be effectual, since there is no Enemy, that values not the security of his own Country, above the honour of conquering ano∣ther.</P>
<P N="4">4. Yet if it be necessary that forein Force be ad∣mitted, they must be inferiour to their own, and such as they may alwayes give Law to, and receive no Jealousie from, that may abate their Authority at home, by that mark of Dependence abroad: Whence it follows, first, that the Forces called in, depend rather upon the Prince that employeth, than the Captain that leadeth them; and secondly, to keep them from uniting in a Body.</P>
<P N="5">5. But however, a cold and impartial compari∣son of the Inconveniencies on all sides, both of ad∣mitting Friends, or yielding to Enemies, being premised; a few Fortresses, such as are up and
<PB N="163" REF="93"/>down in <HI>Liguria,</HI> which controul both Friends and Foes; though I think <HI>Genoa</HI> (as long as the Pope is angry with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and will want its assistance; the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is needy, and must be supplyed by its Bank; the Trade of <HI>Europe</HI> is damm'd up, and must be quickned with its Coyn; the King of <HI>France</HI> is great, suspected and watch∣ed by all its Neighbours) need do no more than improve its Trade, and leave these Rules, which are rather Shifts, and Deliveries, than Po∣licies, to their necessitous Neighbours, the <HI>Vene∣tians,</HI> from whom this is the best Opportunity they will ever have to recover their antient State and Freedom.</P>

<P>THis Dukedom, divided on the East, from the Churches Patrimony, by the River <HI>Piso;</HI> On the West, from <HI>Genoa,</HI> by the River <HI>Macra,</HI> and the impregnable Strong-hold <HI>Sarizna;</HI> On the South, from the <HI>Graecian</HI> Coast, by the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Seas; And on the North, from <HI>Romandiola,</HI> and <HI>Marca Anconitana,</HI> by the <HI>Appennines,</HI> was the greatest <HI>Eye-sore</HI> in all <HI>Italy,</HI> to the Common-wealth of <HI>Rome, before</HI> Christs time (the People of this Place, being the first that carried an Offen∣sive War to the Gates of <HI>Rome</HI>) and the most
<PB N="167" REF="95"/>considerable Thorn in the sides of the See of <HI>Rome since:</HI> whence the Popes, as they grew in strength and power, intermedled with this Province, and finding it sometimes in the <HI>Lombards,</HI> sometimes in the <HI>French,</HI> and sometimes in the <HI>Germans</HI> hands, made bold to bestow it themselves, sometimes on the King of <HI>Naples,</HI> sometimes on the Dukes of <HI>Anjou,</HI> untill the subtile <HI>Florentines</HI> bought their own Liberty of the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus Habspur∣gensis;</HI> and after purchased the Town and Territo∣ry of <HI>Cortona,</HI> of <HI>Ladislaus,</HI> King of <HI>Naples;</HI> that of <HI>Arezzo,</HI> of Duke <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Anjou;</HI> and setling their Duke, have got within their Territories, 1. <HI>Florence,</HI> which hath the <HI>Appennine</HI> on the North, and the Estates of <HI>Pisa,</HI> and <HI>Sienna,</HI> on the South. 2. The small, but rich Seigniory of <HI>Masta,</HI> situ∣ate on the Borders of <HI>Genoa.</HI> 3. <HI>Pisa,</HI> lying to∣wards the Sea, betwixt the <HI>Genoese,</HI> on the <HI>West,</HI> and the Territory of <HI>Sienna,</HI> on the <HI>East,</HI> able of it self once to wage War, both with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and the <HI>Genoese,</HI> from it's notable publick Arsenal for <HI>Shipping.</HI> 4. <HI>Sienna,</HI> situate between the Pa∣trimony of the Church, and the Estate of <HI>Pisa;</HI> the People whereof have been as very <HI>Guelfes,</HI> that is, Men devoted to the Emperours Interest; as they of <HI>Florence</HI> have been <HI>Gibellines,</HI> that is, People devoted to the <HI>Popes:</HI> Upon which ac∣count, rhe Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI> is looked upon, as equally capable of assisting <HI>Austria,</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> a∣gainst the Pope, as the Pope against either of these. To say truth, saith my Author, it stood with good reason of State, that the <HI>Florentine</HI> should use all his wit, to get this City, and keep
<PB N="168" REF="96"/>it; which, besides the accession of 150000. Du∣cats of yearly Revenue, was a Rival with <HI>Florence</HI> in the Command of <HI>Tuscany;</HI> only I may say of the <HI>Florentine,</HI> as Count <HI>Imball</HI> once did, <HI>Non supive dove contestesse O ingegni tanto celebrate de</HI> Floren∣tini: That I could never learn where the celebra∣ted wit of the <HI>Florentines</HI> lay, when they yielded to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> upon the Treaty 1558. the Ports, 1. <HI>Piombino,</HI> 2. <HI>Telamon,</HI> 3. <HI>Droitello,</HI> 4. <HI>Argenterats,</HI> 5. <HI>Hercule,</HI> 6. <HI>Longone,</HI> of so much consequence upon the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and <HI>Tuscan</HI> Seas, that they do not only keep the Dukes of <HI>Tuscany</HI> at the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Devotion, but like∣wise enable them to carry the Keyes of <HI>Italy</HI> at their girdle, and become Lords Paramount of those Seas.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Islands in the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Seas, as 1. <HI>Iola</HI> or <HI>Elba,</HI> 10. miles from <HI>Piombino</HI> (which if the <HI>Turks</HI> had, they would be Masters of <HI>Province</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>) defended by two Castles, on two little Mountains, made impregnable by Art and Na∣ture. 2. <HI>Giglio,</HI> bordering on the <HI>Genoese.</HI> 3. <HI>Capraria,</HI> not farr from <HI>Legorn.</HI> Time was, when the Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> had so great a kindness for this Dukedom, that on the great Politician <HI>Cosmo de Medici</HI>'s Coronet, one of them caused this to be engraved, <HI>His Quintus Pont. Max. ob eximiam dilectionem &amp; Religionis Catholicae Zelum praecipu∣um{que}, justitiae Donavit.</HI> But since, when one of this Dukes Successors would have been created King of <HI>Tuscary,</HI> the Pope answered, <HI>That he was content he should be a King in</HI> Tuscany, <HI>but not King of</HI> Tuscany. Ever since which time, the great Port,
<PB N="169" REF="96"/>on the main Land <HI>Legorn,</HI> hath been well defend∣ed with 12. Galleys, 2. Gallions, 5. Galliasses, the Maritime Strength of that Dukedom. The Land hath been secured with 16000. Men, al∣wayes in Armes, under the most experienced Cap∣tains, besides so many Fors and Towns in conti∣nual Garrison, that his Estate is said <HI>to be made of Iron.</HI> In which respect this Duke is a dreadful Neighbour, both to <HI>Millain,</HI> with whom he hath waged 5. Years War at a time, and the <HI>Genoese</HI> and <HI>Lucans,</HI> which he spareth only out of his re∣spect to the Kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>This Duke is at this day the richest Prince, and this State the wisest Common-wealth in <HI>Europe,</HI> able as well to buy the Popes friendship, and look into the Intrigues of <HI>France,</HI> which is their most profitable Friend, and most dangerous Enemy. The first in respect of <HI>Spain,</HI> whose ambitious Counsels, touching the seizure of <HI>Italy,</HI> it di∣sturbs. The second in respect of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> whose troublesome Pretensions it may effectually assist. Neither is the <HI>See</HI> of <HI>Romes</HI> favour less consi∣derable to this State, than the <HI>Realm</HI> of <HI>France's,</HI> since, besides it's mediation between this Dukedom, &amp; the Empire (in whose Court this Duke bestow∣eth 35000. Crowns yearly for favour) if the Pope should be angry, he hath an open Passage into <HI>Tuscany,</HI> advantaged with supplyes of all kinds from <HI>Lombardy</HI> and <HI>Bononia;</HI> whereas, on the o∣ther side; the <HI>Tuscan</HI> hath no way to invade St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Patrimony, but over such craggy Moun∣tains, as no Army or Artillery can pass, or be maintained. Towards other Princes he carrieth a
<PB N="170" REF="97"/>fair respect, as willing to maintain the Trade of <HI>Legorn</HI> and <HI>Florence;</HI> towards which, and the Sea-Forces that must preserve it, this Prince hath amassed an infinite treasure; and may do very well, but that the <HI>Genoans</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> have this advan∣tage of him, that they are as wise in publick Coun∣sels, as his People are in private; and that they can alter their Resolutions with the Occasions, whilst they of <HI>Florence</HI> stick to their Decrees, not∣withstanding all Events. Besides that, this Prince, with the assistance of his Brother, and Uncle, of the <HI>Sacred College,</HI> have this defect, that they pre∣tend to arrive at that in a short time, to which o∣ther Potentates could not attain, but by a successi∣on of many Ages. Yet the Dukedom being cen∣tred in the very Navel of <HI>Italy,</HI> is thereby furthest from Invasion on all sides, and the most partici∣pant of the Common Interest, which may secure that State in the busiest times, though a little o∣ver-awed by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who holdeth in actual possession <HI>Pont Hercule, Telemene,</HI> and <HI>Piombino,</HI> the Setlers (as the Historians call them) of <HI>He∣truria.</HI></P>

<P>THis Kingdom, environed round with the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Sea, contains 700.

It were worth the while, to understand the reason, why so devout a Son of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> should renounce it's Supremacy in this Island, for∣bidding
<PB N="173" REF="98"/>any man, upon pain of death, to appeal to the Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> insomuch that <HI>Baronius,</HI> in his 11th. <HI>Tome,</HI> writes against him; and he hath forbidden the Importation of that Book, into ei∣ther <HI>Naples,</HI> or <HI>Sicily,</HI> upon pain of Banishment to Noblemen, and the Galleys to the common Peo∣ple. Indeed, since that Author hath taught the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> the supposititiousness of the Bull, whereby <HI>Spain</HI> holds this Place, it's high time to exclude the Power of that Court, and deny their Authority to dispose of it to any, since they find not the Grant whereby it was bestowed on it.

<HEAD>THE Kingdom OF <HI>NAPLES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen we reflect on the State of this King∣dom, the frequent Seditions in it were a <HI>Wonder,</HI> considering the Settlement of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Reiglement (but for <HI>Spains</HI> 2. Over-sights in Go∣vernment, alterations of Vice-Royes, and op∣pression of Subjects) and the present Peace, were a <HI>Miracle,</HI> considering the subtilty and restless∣ness of the Inhabitants; but for <HI>Spains</HI> two poli∣tique Diversions, the one more serious, an hour∣ly Devotion; the other more jocund, a daily Co∣medy; they would revenge their being so <HI>poor,</HI> but that they are kept <HI>so,</HI> as well by their own <HI>va∣nity,</HI> which is <HI>wisely humored,</HI> as their Governours <HI>Impositions,</HI> which are <HI>necessarily exacted;</HI> besides the two Securities for their Peaceableness, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. That the Commonalty thinketh all Employment above them, but the Plough: 2. That the Gentry
<PB N="175" REF="99"/>judge all Business below them, but their Pleasure; the first of which humours will keep them too low, and the second too bare, to be troublesome; to which I may add two more, 1. Their Perfidy and Treachery, that makes it impossible for them to trust one another in a Design: 2. Their Rudeness &amp; Ig∣norance, whereby they are capable of managing nothing but the great Horse. Were not half the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Clergy Dependents on the King, <HI>Spain</HI> might be jealous of <HI>Rome;</HI> and did not half hold of the Pope, <HI>Rome</HI> might distrust <HI>Spain;</HI> and because they were wholly neithers, both might fear, did not <HI>that,</HI> in this last Age, set up for the Spiritual Monarchy of <HI>this,</HI> and <HI>this</HI> for the Temporal one of <HI>that.</HI> The Fate of <HI>Italy</HI> is it's only security against the <HI>French,</HI> and that of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> against the <HI>Turk;</HI> while this last had often in∣vaded it, as they did 1433. had it not been the Key of <HI>Christendom;</HI> and the first had often sur∣prized it, as they intended under <HI>Lewis</HI> the 12th. but that is an Inlet into the Papacy: though the People would out at the <HI>Back-door,</HI> under the <HI>Saracen,</HI> as formerly, but that they choose <HI>slave∣ry</HI> (as they call their duty) rather than barbarism: And at the <HI>Fore-door,</HI> under the <HI>French,</HI> but that that is not an <HI>Escape,</HI> but a change of pressures. The Emissaries of <HI>Richlieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarine</HI> had often embroyled this Place, had not those more nume∣rous, from the Pope, secured it. The Horse be∣stowed on his Holiness, keeping the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in the Saddle, and the Caution that the Church puts in at that Ceremony, that she be not <HI>prejudi∣ced in her Right,</HI> is the best ground: Of the other,
<PB N="176" REF="100"/>the King of <HI>Spain</HI> puts, that he be not <HI>disturbed in his Power,</HI> especially since the Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> could do the <HI>French</HI> against <HI>Arragon,</HI> as much right as <HI>Gon Salvo</HI> did <HI>Arragon</HI> against <HI>France,</HI> did not <HI>Millain</HI> bestir it's self, on the one hand; and had not the Pope diverted the <HI>French,</HI> on the o∣ther: Although the modern ambition of the <HI>Ne∣politan</HI> Noblemen, is more dangerous at this time, than the antient pretension of the <HI>French</HI> King (al∣beit bottomed on the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>'s Adoption, Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the 7th's Confirmation, the last Will of the Duke of <HI>Main,</HI> and the Agreement between <HI>Lewis</HI> the 12th. and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Castile,</HI> nothing obstructing, but the Popes gift of it upon <HI>Spain</HI>) did not the <HI>Spanish</HI> Preferment divide, and the <HI>Castilian</HI> Army of 6000. Foot, and 2000. Horse, awe them, and their King prove too hard for them. I know not whether more by drayning 22000. <HI>Neapolitans</HI> into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrisons, or by drawing 4000. <HI>Germans</HI> into the <HI>Neapolitan.</HI> Besides that, every second House maintains a foot Souldier (a Janizary extraordina∣ry) sent out of <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Germany.</HI> 1. Which to∣gether with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> firm League with the Pope, 2. their Confederacy in <HI>Italy,</HI> 3. their Im∣poverishing of the Nobility, 4. their Indulgence to the Commonalty, 5. their strong Navy at Sea, 6. the Jealousies of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> 7. the Largesses bestowed on the Clergy, and 8. the Fears of <HI>Venice</HI> (the 8. Branches of their Interest of State) may secure the Peace of that unquiet Place, for this Age, if it escapes an alteration upon the death of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> whose Treasure is more

<HEAD>THE Republique OF <HI>RAGUSA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Command of this puny State is of little Extent, the Soyl very unfruitful and steril, without any River, and the City situated among abrupt Hills, and many mighty Neighbours, and nevertheless this Republique, for some hundreds of Years, when as other greater Soveraignties of <HI>Senia, Bosnia, Hungary,</HI> &amp;c. were destroyed by the <HI>Turk,</HI> hath not only preserved her self, but advanced her Subjects in Wealth and Reputation. She commands in the <HI>Dalmatian</HI> Coast, from <HI>Cape Cumeno,</HI> to <HI>Castelnuovo,</HI> about 4. Miles into the Land; as also over these 4. Islands, <HI>Agosta, Melada, Inpana, Calamita.</HI></P>
<PB N="178" REF="101"/>
<P>The City lying long-wayes, is yet no more than 2000. Paces in it's Circumference, and cannot be made greater, or enlarged, because of one side it lyeth against a Rock, which commands it; and on the other against the Sea; And because Merchan∣dise and Peace have flourished here so long, it is built very narrow, with high Houses, and is full of Inhabitants; who being necessitated to spread themselves among the adjacent Lands, when they have gotten Estates, fix at home. It is fortified with Walls, and quadrangular Towers, ramm'd and filled with Earth; but the impregnable Castle standing upon the aforesaid Rock, and encompas∣sed in a manner with the Sea, commands both it, and the Haven.</P>
<P>No man, but a Gentleman of <HI>Ragusa,</HI> hath any thing to do in the Government; and he that mar∣ries with an under Degree, loseth his Gentility; by which means there are now but 24. Families. All Gentlemen aged 20. are Members of the Great Council; and of these Gentry there were lately in number 317. In all their Councils, they vote by Ballot, and to any Offices and Dignities, 3. are first named, and out of them one chosen, as in <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI> The Rector of the Republique, with his 11. Counsellours, out of different Families, ap∣pear in all the Colleges, there to vote with those of the College. These 12. were called the Little Council, for they assemble every day, to receive Petitions, Remonstrances, Agents, Envoyes, or Letters, either from Strangers, or the Inhabi∣tants, and do deliberate thereupon, but conclude nothing; In this manner they serve 12. Months,
<PB N="179" REF="101"/>and are then discharged, and are not eligible again for 2. Years, as is usual in all the Colleges, except the Senate, and the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> who are alwayes continued. This Senate consists of 48. and with the Little Council of 12. is made up to 60. who resolve upon all which the Little Council propo∣seth. Thitty five of these is a <HI>Quorum,</HI> and may conclude by Major Voices; for among these 60. are alwayes 5. old men, of divers Families, who are to be present at such Resolutions; and to pro∣vide <HI>Ne quod detrimenti capiat Respublica.</HI></P>
<P>There are 4. Collectors, who receive the Intra∣do or Revenue of the Publique, and pay, upon assignation of the Little Council, to the 2. under Receivers, that which they have occasion for the ordinary Charge of the Publique, and that which remains overplus, is brought into the Treasury, of which 5. antient honourable persons (as they do the Money of the Orphans) keep the Keyes, and these men continue 5. Years in this service.</P>
<P>Their whole Revenue can hardly amount to 30000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, which ariseth chiefly out of the Impost on Wine, and out of this they pay the <HI>Turk</HI> for Protection 5000 <HI>l.</HI> and lay-out as much upon his Bashaws, to have Friends at Court; for their great Negotiation in the <HI>Levant,</HI> makes them al∣wayes to have business there; for this Money they are Toll and Custom free, which is a matter of great advantage to them, and preferrs their Com∣modities before any others.</P>
<P>The whole Force of this Common-wealth, be∣sides the Burgers, is a 100. <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who are a kind of Garrison to the City, and serve the Ma∣gistrate
<PB N="180" REF="102"/>to put Sentences in Execution. These are commanded by City night Captains, 6. where∣of are chosen every 2. Months, 3. of them shut the Gates by day, and guard them with Burgers, and some of these <HI>Hungarians,</HI> till midnight, then come the other 3. Captains, and relieve their Bro∣thers, and in the Morning open the Gates; be∣fore the shutting whereof, according to the Roll, 2. Gentlemen, under 40. Years old, do daily guard, the one the Castle of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and the other the new Fort, and tarry there till they are relieved, by Persons of the same quality, the next day; all other Officers and Captains, who serve the State abroad, either in War, or Negoti∣ation, are chosen by the great Senate, some for 7. others for 12. Months.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Ragusa</HI> are of the <HI>Romish</HI> Re∣ligion, and have a Bishop, but he must be a Stranger; Moreover they have 2. Churches, one for the Men, where the Preachers are hired by the year, by the State; and the other for the Women, where Preachers are hired for their lives; the Common∣wealth not fearing the levity and sedition of the Women, who are naturally modest, and keep al∣wayes at home; but suspecting the Men, who, by the constant insinuations and inculcations of some pestilent Doctrines, might be perverted. The charge of the Church Goods and Revenue is committed to three Ecclesiastiques. Thus have I given a more particular account of this little Spot, because nothing was ever yet published, to give satisfaction, what it's Module was. As to it's In∣terest, the <HI>Turk</HI> governs it wholly, and it is in∣considerable
<PB N="181" REF="102"/>to <HI>Christendom.</HI> He could swallow it when he would, for all the <HI>Venetian</HI> (contrary to the vulgar Errour, that it is a Poize betwixt them) were it not, that he cannot make more of it, nor so much, as now he doth. It sufficeth, that they do abundance of good Offices, in relieving of Christans, in their Traffiquing in the <HI>Levant,</HI> and that's the best supply to be expected from them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>GERMANY,</HI> AND The several Dominions, Principalities, and States thereof.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now to discourse of a great, but he∣terogeneous Body, made up of divers Religions, divers Laws and Customes, and different Constitutions, under many Princes; for in the Declension of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, after
<PB N="182" REF="103"/>the frequent Devastations of it by the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> when <HI>Charlemaign</HI> had setled his Conquest therein, he divided it among his Sons; and their Successors likewise multiplyed it into more Divisions: After∣wards, when the Empire came to be Elective, by the <HI>Aurca Bulla</HI> (and had lessened the Popes pe∣remptory and absolute Authority therein, who yet continues formalities of Confirmation, &amp; without which none can be called <HI>Augustus,</HI> the only barr to Protestant Princes, on whom he will never conferr it) and the Power thereof confirmed by <HI>Gregory</HI> the 5th, a <HI>German,</HI> to the three Electors Ecclesiastick, and 4. Temporal, all being within the Pale of the Empire; the Candidates, for that Dignity, to assure their Advancement, would bribe Voices with the Patrimony thereof, by which means, and their liberality to their Fa∣vourites, while it was in their power to do them good (as knowing their Authority was very tran∣sient) together with the Covetousness, and sor∣did Huckstery of some Emperours, who sold the Imperial Lands for Money, little or nothing was left to maintain the Majesty of the Place.</P>
<P>Besides these squanderings made in <HI>Germany,</HI> a great deal more hath been limbed from it, which belonged to it, as it was the Representative of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, under which name it ports it to this day; but it is but a meer shadow of that migh∣ty State; for the Pope stript it of all it's Feathers in <HI>Italy</HI> through the frequent Broyles raised by Excommunication and Anathemaes against the Em∣perours, who were willing to part with that di∣stant Dominion, which they could not keep,
<PB N="183" REF="103"/>without unsufferable Expence and Hazard of all; then the Dukes of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Lorrain</HI> refused to own them, more than formally, and in Title, which were main Members of the Empire; as did also the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>It will be needless to insist longer upon this Consideration, having premised, that for 10. Descents together, the Dignity hath continued in the <HI>Austrian</HI> Family, and three before that, the Founder of this Family being <HI>Rodulph,</HI> Earl of <HI>Habsburg,</HI> a Prince of a mean Estate, but great Spirit, who succeeded our Earl, <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> after a vacancy of 12. Years, the Electors continuing it so long in vain, in hope of a Pur∣chaser like <HI>Richard,</HI> the greatest Moneyed Man in <HI>Europe.</HI> The perpetuating of it in this Family so long, was effected by the policy of <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. who caused his Brother <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to be Elect∣ed <HI>Rex Romanorum</HI> in his life time, and soon af∣ter resigned the Empire to him; which course hath been observed ever since, till the Reign of <HI>Leo∣pold Ignatius,</HI> the present Emperour, who was chosen after his Father's death, but his Brother <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was chosen before him in this manner. The College of these Electors was once a <HI>Septem∣virate,</HI> but by the proscription of <HI>Frederick</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> the Father of this present Prince, the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was substituted in his Place; and upon the Restoration of this <HI>Charles Lodowick,</HI> an Expedient was found to make him the <HI>Octovir,</HI> but so, that he is the last of them all, by this means. Their Names are the Arch-bishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Triers,</HI> and Arch-bishop
<PB N="184" REF="104"/>of <HI>Colen,</HI> Spiritual Electors; the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Mar∣quess of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and Count Palatine of the <HI>Rhine:</HI> And as to their Precedency, the Ecclesia∣stical, who are chosen by and out of their own Fun∣ction, have the first place; among the Secular, the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> between the later three of the four, it is not yet agreed. There are other great and free Princes, who have Voices in the Imperial Diets, and are Tributaries at will to the Emperour, such are the Dukes of <HI>Brunswick. Lu∣nenburg, Wittenburg, Lantgrave</HI> of <HI>Hassia,</HI> &amp;c. several Bishops, with secular Jurisdiction, as of <HI>Saltzburg,</HI> &amp;c. And lastly, Free Cities, which are of two sorts, not reckoning the Residences or Metropolis of free Princes, <HI>viz.</HI> Cities Imperial, in number 60. formerly 96. such as have bought their Liberties of the Emperours, and pay a small tribute yearly, and ⅔ <HI>ds.</HI> of all Assessements at the Diets to them, such as <HI>Spiers, Wormes, No∣remburg, Stralburg,</HI> and many others; of all which more particularly in the Description of the several Provinces.</P>
<P>As to the Religion of this People, except under Ecclesiastical States, the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Hereditary Countries of the Emperour, it is altogether Reformed, but for the most part <HI>Lu∣theran;</HI> betwixt whom, and the <HI>Calvinist,</HI> there is as great a Fend and Difference, as between the <HI>Romanists,</HI> and either of them.</P>
<P>The Force of this whole Region of <HI>Germany,</HI> hath been computed to amount to 200000. Men,
<PB N="185" REF="104"/>and somewhat above half that number hath been often seen effect if in one body, in Expeditions a∣gainst the <HI>Turks;</HI> and if we consider the multitude of Garrisons, and the many Armies on foot, in the late War, between <HI>Sweden,</HI> and this Empire, there can be thought to be few less of both sides. The best Footmen are those of <HI>Tiroll, Swevia,</HI> and <HI>Westphalia:</HI> the best Horsemen, those of <HI>Bruns∣wick, Cleveland,</HI> and <HI>Franconia.</HI> Of Weapons, they handle the Sword and Harquebuze best. In the Field they are very strong, as well to give the Charge, as to bear the Shock; where Order, which they duly observe, is of great effect, and it is as it were natural unto them, to keep a stately pace, and firm standing. They are not accounted on for defence of Fortresses, or to hold Garrisons: and by reason of their corpulent bodies, they are not fit to storm a Town, unless to fill the breaches: And therefore they are accounted rather resolute and constant, than fierce and couragious; for they do not much affect that service, wherein they see too much of hazard. After the Victory, they do kill all whom they meet, without difference of Age, Sex, or Calling. If the War be drawn out at length, or if they be close besieged, they pre∣sently either mutiny, or give up the Town (but there alwayes excepting to general Rules.) In Camp they can endure no delayes, nor will they practice the Art of Temporizing: If their first En∣terprize and Attempt falls not out to their mind, they will hardly be engaged again, or perswaded to it by any means; and if they once begin to run, they will hardly turn their backs again, as was
<PB N="186" REF="105"/>wofully manifest in the Battel of <HI>Kevesture,</HI> in 1596. betwixt <HI>Matthias</HI> the Arch-duke, and Sul∣tan <HI>Mahomet.</HI> He that retains them, must be at extraordinary charge, and great trouble, by rea∣son of their Baggages, and Wives, who follow the Camp, and consume abundance of Provision, and without that they stand in no stead. Their Horses are rather strong than couragious, of ten of which, eight are usually prest from the Plough, which ren∣ders them of small service; and besides, they quail when they see their blood.</P>
<P>The Revenue of the Empire, which comes to the Emperour, is so little worth, that it is scarce worth mentioning; for, besides the Tribute paid by the free Cities, which is but 15000. Guilders yearly, 1500 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, there is little else that can be reckoned as a Revenue; It had need there∣fore of some Prince, whose own Estate can support the Grandeur of the Dignity; which hath been an∣other reason, why the House of <HI>Austria</HI> hath held it so long: as also, for that it is the only Rampire against the formidable Power of the <HI>Turks.</HI> And his Authority is as little as his Revenue, for he hath no Negative Voice, but is as it were the su∣preme Officer, to execute the Decrees of the Diets: whereas the Princes, and free Cities, are absolutely Soveraign; and can, in their Assembly General, Depose him, if they see cause.</P>
<P>We come now to Particulars, and pass into <HI>East-Freisland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. East-Freisland.</NOTE> a County of the Empire, sub-di∣vided into the County of <HI>Embden,</HI> or <HI>East-Freis∣land</HI> properly so called, and the County of <HI>Ol∣denburg,</HI> both of them extending Northwards, to
<PB N="187" REF="105"/>the <HI>German</HI> Ocean; bounded on the West with the River <HI>Emms,</HI> which parts them from <HI>West-Freis∣land;</HI> on the East with the River <HI>Weser,</HI> which di∣vides them from <HI>Westphalia;</HI> and on the South with the Earldom of <HI>Mark.</HI> It is a very fruitful Coun∣try, and most populous, thick built, full of Arable and Pasture Land, affording plenty of excel∣lent Cattel, Butter, Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to their Neigh∣bours. The Earldom of <HI>East-Freisland,</HI> or <HI>Emb∣den,</HI> was formerly governed by Provincial Earls, under the Emperours of <HI>Germany,</HI> to whom they were accountable, untill the Year 1453. when <HI>Ubrick</HI> the Governour was invested with the Here∣ditary Title of it, in whose Family it continues at this day. That which advanced him, being his Conquest of the City of <HI>Embden,</HI> from the <HI>Ham∣burgers;</HI> which City, considerable for its Traffique and Situation, becoming <HI>Calvinist,</HI> turned Rebel, and revolted from their Prince, as a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> and confederated themselves, as a Republique, with the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> in 1592. and so con∣tinues.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Oldenburg</HI> is of a farr antienter standing, and of a Princely Descendency, and is Master of as fine, and larger a Country, by some Provinces bequeathed to him by the Countess of <HI>Jevere;</HI> infinitely stored with Oxen, Sheep, But∣ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with Venison also, which run in large and fair Woods, the pleasant Game of the Gentry of this County. He is allyed to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> as descended from a common Ancestor, <HI>Christiern</HI> the 2d. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the 4th. of the Name of Earl of <HI>Oldenburg.</HI></P>
<PB N="188" REF="106"/>
<P>Both these Princes are reckoned as Members of the Empire, but they are lame ones, and are of no use to it, for they contribute nothing to the publick Charge, nor come to the Diets; but which means they exempt themselves, and are uncon∣cerned in this <HI>Turkish</HI> War. The Earl of <HI>East-Freisland</HI> is like to be engaged in this <HI>Holland</HI> Bu∣siness, about the <HI>Eyler Sconce:</HI> nor will the Count of <HI>Oldenburg</HI> be suffered to be at quiet, if it comes once to Armes and Parties. However, their In∣terest is to live at Peace, and good Correspon∣dence with their Neighbours, the best security to small Estates; but there are some old Grudges, which this Juncture will give vent to: And so we leave them, and pass to <HI>Westphalia.</HI></P>
<P>This Country is bounded on the North with the Dutchy of <HI>Holstein,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. West∣phalia.</NOTE> and the River <HI>Elb;</HI> on the East and South with <HI>Hassia,</HI> &amp;c. and on the West with <HI>Colen, Cleveland, Overryssel,</HI> and the two <HI>Freislands.</HI> The Country is in most places full of VVoods, which bear plenty of Acorns, and nou∣rish many herds of Swine, which make Bacon of excellent relish and tenderness: and in other places as plentiful of Corn. In this Province stands the City and Bishoprick of <HI>Munster,</HI> infamous for the Story of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leyden,</HI> and as famous for the late Treaty, and general Pacification, in 1648. Since which time this City hath had some Disputes with their Bishop, but now composed to a good understanding, by the powerful Interest of the <HI>Hol∣lander,</HI> who espoused the Cities quarrel. 2. <HI>Min∣den,</HI> once a Bishoprick, now setled upon the Mar∣quess of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> with the Title of Prince,
<PB N="189" REF="106"/>in lieu of what the <HI>Swede</HI> had of his, by the same Treaty: He hath likewise here a secular Town and County of <HI>Ravensberg,</HI> in right of his part-inhe∣ritance in the Dutchy of <HI>Cleve.</HI> Here is also the Bishoprick of <HI>Osnaling,</HI> the alternate succession to the Profits whereof, is given, by the <HI>Munster</HI> Treaty, to the Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> for his cession of his Bishoprick of <HI>Halberstadt.</HI> Not to omit the Town and Castle of <HI>Aremberg,</HI> with the ample and goodly Patrimony thereof, which gives Title to the noble Family of the Counts of <HI>Aremberg,</HI> eminent for their service done the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> where, as his Subjects, they have o∣ther Estates.</P>
<P>Lastly, The Bishoprick of <HI>Bremen,</HI> which is the second Division of <HI>Westphalia;</HI> formerly go∣verned by its own Diocesans, but of modern times the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Sons enjoyed the Title, with the Protection of it; till, by the late Treaty at <HI>Munster,</HI> it was assigned, together with the Bishoprick of <HI>Verde,</HI> to the <HI>Swede</HI> (with condi∣tion, that the City and Territory should enjoy their antient Privileges and Liberties) who, with much adoe, had Possession delivered to his General Count <HI>Coningsmarck.</HI> It is a rich and fair City, and much traffiqued, by reason of its situation upon the <HI>Weser,</HI> which dischargeth it self into the <HI>Elb,</HI> and so joyntly into the <HI>German</HI> Ocean. In this Bi∣shoprick stands the City of <HI>Stoad,</HI> famous once, and made for ever, by the <HI>English</HI> Staple, upon some discontent removed some time agon hither from <HI>Hamburgh.</HI></P>
<P>There are other petty States and Earldomes
<PB N="190" REF="107"/>herein, which, together with the rest, acknow∣ledge the Emperour, but it is more in shew than effect; although they were scared to some real performances, by the Emperours successes in these parts, in 1627, when he overcame the <HI>Dane.</HI> The Title hereof as Ducal, is used by the Arch-bi∣shop of <HI>Colen,</HI> and the House of <HI>Saxon Lunen∣burg;</HI> but with the same Profits thence, as the Emperour receives; notwithstanding, in this pres∣sing Condition of the Empire, and in all general Taxes, they pay their proportion, as a Circuit of the Empire.</P>
<P>So we pass Westward, to another Border of the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Cleve.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> consist∣ing, while it was the entire Patrimony of those Dukes, of four Members, 1. <HI>Cleve,</HI> 2. <HI>Gulick,</HI> 3. <HI>Berg</HI> or <HI>Mont,</HI> 4. <HI>Marck;</HI> the two last divided from the other by the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and severally joyned, some two Centuries agoe, to one another, in the Family of <HI>Cleve;</HI> the last Duke whereof, <HI>John William,</HI> dying in 1610. without Issue, this am∣ple and princely Estate, the main whereof had con∣tinued 900. Years in this Family, came to be di∣vided (after mature consideration of the evil of a War) equally between the Marquess of <HI>Branden∣burg,</HI> and <HI>Wolfgang,</HI> Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> a young∣er Descendant of the House <HI>Palatine;</HI> whose Fa∣thers had married the Sisters of the deceased Duke, but <HI>Brandenburg</HI> the eldest. It was first agreed be∣tween these two Princes, to govern the Estates joyntly, but afterwards they fell out, by being too familiar; insomuch that the <HI>Brandenburger,</HI> at a Treatment made by him, gave the other a box
<PB N="191" REF="107"/>of the ear; which unseemly injury, caused the Palatine of <HI>Newburg,</HI> to call in the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the other the States General: Of which Story read more in the Duke of <HI>Rohans</HI> Observations upon this subject. Both the Partitions are subject to the Laws of the Empire, and are obliged to the pro∣portionable supplyes.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this Country are the three Elect∣oral Arch-bishopricks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Colen.</NOTE> the first whereof is that of <HI>Colen,</HI> a fair and goodly Country, bounded every way upon some part of the Dutchy of <HI>Cleve,</HI> but on the South limited by the Land of <HI>Triers;</HI> the present Elector is the Uncle to the Duke of <HI>Bava∣ria,</HI> and considerable in his Interest, as to the Catho∣lick Cause, being also Prince and Pastour of the City and Jurisdiction of <HI>Leige,</HI> the Government whereof resides in him, and the Canons of that Cathedral, who by right elect their Prince or Pro∣tector as aforesaid: This Arch-bishop is Chancel∣lour of <HI>Italy,</HI> and second in Dignity.</P>
<P>To this succeeds the Arch-bishoprick of <HI>Triers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Triers.</NOTE> whose Bishop is the Chancellour of <HI>France</HI> for the Emperour: This Country lyes all along South the <HI>Moselle,</HI> on the East lyes <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> on the West <HI>Franconia;</HI> It is a pleasant, but not a fruitful Country.</P>
<P>The Arch-bishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mentz.</NOTE> although last men∣tioned, is first in Dignity, as being Chancellour of the sacred Empire: His Jurisdiction, like some of our Diocesses, lyes dispersed in several Countries; so that his temporal Estate is a great deal less than the other two: Nor had any of them enjoyed such secular advantages of Dominion, had it not been
<PB N="192" REF="108"/>for that the Empire was made Elective, and they set their price often upon the Market; Besides, there hath happened a dissolution of many great Estates, out of which they have carved to them∣selves what they liked, with the Connivence of the Empire, and under the specious pretence of <HI>Dee∣dands,</HI> and Bequests to the Church.</P>
<P>The Interest of these Electors, is to defend the Papal, Imperial, and their own Authority, of which they are equally jealous, from the Reform∣ed: Notwithstanding the Arch-bishop of <HI>Triers</HI> took part, or was a secret friend to <HI>France,</HI> in the late <HI>Swedish</HI> War, which made the <HI>French</HI> so hot upon the rescue of his Country, and so resolute in the freeing of it: But in case of danger to the Em∣pire, no question is to be made, but they will unanimously concurr against it; and with them∣selves, they draw all the Ecclesiastical States of <HI>Germany:</HI> And are prone enough to assist the Em∣perour against the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>The next Principality or Dutchy we shall treat of is <HI>Lorrain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Lorrain.</NOTE> the Duke whereof is a Prince of the Empire, and the Country reckoned as a part of the fifth Circle of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and as a Feudatory there∣of, stickled hard in the late War, for the Empe∣rour, to the loss of his Country, and his almost undoing; but by the Treaty of the general Peace, he was restored to a great part of it. It is bounded and circumscribed between the lower <HI>Palatinate, Alsats, Triers,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Bar, Burgundy,</HI> and <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> all of them fine Provinces; nor is <HI>Lorrain</HI> inferiour to the most of them, were it not for some dark and thick Forrests, which inter∣sperse
<PB N="193" REF="108"/>the Country. There were in it formerly some Imperial Towns, as <HI>Metz, Verdun,</HI> and <HI>Thoul;</HI> but <HI>Henry</HI> the 2d. of <HI>France,</HI> reduced them under his obedience, and erected a Parliament there, to make it a perpetual Province of <HI>France,</HI> as it hath since proved: Of late it hath lost some Ducal Towns (and Provinces, as the whole Dutchy of <HI>Bar,</HI> taken from him by <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13th. and County of <HI>Clermont</HI>) viz. <HI>Moyenvic, Stenay, Dun,</HI> and <HI>Jametz;</HI> these three last be∣longing formerly to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and re∣stored to him by this Treaty; and the Provost-ship of <HI>Merville;</HI> Besides, the Duke is at all times to give passage to the <HI>French</HI> Forces into <HI>Germany,</HI> and to renounce all Leagues, Alliances, and In∣telligences with any forein States or Princes, to the prejudice of that Kingdom; withall, he was bound up to an acquiescence in whatsoever had pas∣sed by judicial proceeding, gift, or disposal of the Kings of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> untill the date of the Treaty, by which these Conditions were also a∣greed to be ratified by the Emperour: This was a bad bargain, but more could not be obtained; so that the said Duke, feeing himself thus exposed to the Armes of the <HI>French</HI> King, and any sudden surprize, upon pretence of passage, besides many other Retrenchments of his Soveraignty, did offer, by a Treaty, to surrender the same wholly into the hands of the King, upon Condition, his Family to be admitted, as Princes of the Blood, and to the succession of the Crown, after those of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> with some Provision of Money and Pension, for the support of his Dignity and Family; and this
<PB N="194" REF="109"/>was highly talked of, and near a Conclusion, but it is not yet confirmed and accomplished.</P>
<P>As to his Interest, we may guess how narrow it is; and how he is pent up, as to any Concern of his in <HI>Europe,</HI> by that comprehensive Clause, That he shall not hold Intelligence with any Prince, to the prejudice of <HI>France;</HI> which will be construed so, if he send but a Complement to any of them. The <HI>French</HI> King hath had a longing envious eye up∣on his Country, as dis-joyning his Conquests from his other Countries, and therefore he lives here but precariously, and as a Tenant at will. As to the <HI>Turks,</HI> he concludes, there are no such Infi∣dels, as the <HI>French</HI> Ministers of State, who laid all wayes to entrap him, and finally forced him to take Armes against <HI>France,</HI> as a desperate remedy. Besides, he is extremely poor (although his Re∣venue is said to amount to 700000. Crowns, a good part whereof ariseth from his Salt made here, which the <HI>French</HI> King hath bargained to be afford∣ed to <HI>Metz,</HI> and <HI>Alsatia,</HI> &amp;c. a price current) and cannot lend a Stiver, nor raise a Hand against them, in his present Condition, the result of his barbarous plunderings, in which his Forces ex∣ceeded those very <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> and like to like was seldom opposed.</P>
<P>We proceed next to <HI>Alsatia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Alsatia.</NOTE> or <HI>Elsas,</HI> whose boundaties are these, briefly; On the East the <HI>Rhine,</HI> with <HI>Baden,</HI> on the North the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> on the South part of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and on the West <HI>Lorrain;</HI> divided by the Mountain <HI>Voyesus;</HI> a fine and pleasant Country, d vided into three parts, the Lower, and the Higher, and the third called
<PB N="195" REF="109"/><HI>Zuricgaw,</HI> bordering upon <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the two last Divisions, by the Treaty of <HI>Munster,</HI> being assigned over to the <HI>French</HI> King, in the name of the whole (on Condition only of paying 30000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling to the Arch-duke of <HI>Inspruck,</HI> the Pro∣vince before belonging to the Imperial Family) for his Expences in the preceding War of the Lower <HI>Alsatia.</HI> The Bishop of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> or <HI>Argentina,</HI> the chief City seated therein, is yet Lord and Go∣vernour: There are in it besides many Imperial Cities, free from the Jurisdiction of the <HI>French;</HI> so that he hath little more than the modern Strengths, and Command of the Country: and yet so much in that, by his free passage into <HI>Germany,</HI> that he is well recompenced for troubling it; ha∣ving <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> a most strong Town in the <HI>Pala∣tinate,</HI> and the County and Town of <HI>Brisac</HI> added to the bargain. There is some Difference arisen, by some pretences of the <HI>French,</HI> to admit the Go∣vernours of the two Imperial Cities of <HI>Colmar</HI> and <HI>Slechstadt,</HI> both antient and strong Towns; and this Duke <HI>Mazarini</HI> demands, by his right, as the Governour of the Province, and the King in∣tends to effect by force; which makes many men think, there are some Designes that way, upon this quarrelling Punctilio; but the free Cities will assuredly not suffer any such intrusion or violence upon their Privileges, and the Princes will brook it as little: Considering this, and other the like Piques, in other places, in this Juncture, it seems as if there were a Conspiration of those little Mis∣chiefs, like the appearance of the small Cloud, that will condensate and overspread <HI>Christendom</HI> at
<PB N="196" REF="110"/>last, and shower it with abundance of blood and misery.</P>
<P>What this Country signifies against the <HI>Turk,</HI> is easily resolvable, for <HI>hinc Dolor hinc Lachrymae,</HI> here was the fatal Jealousie lodged, that rendred the Emperour so impotent and feeble against the <HI>Barbarians.</HI> This, if any thing, is one of the great Remoras, that retarded the quick work, which would have been made with that Enemy, by the <HI>German</HI> Princes, and therefore we will put down this Province for a Cypher, if it be not al∣ready reckoned, with some large numeral Figure, by the other side.</P>
<P>The <HI>Palatinate</HI> lyes next to this, with which it is bounded on the South;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Palat.</NOTE> on the East with the Duke∣dom of <HI>Wittenberg,</HI> and some part of <HI>Franconia;</HI> and on the West with <HI>Triers:</HI> And because this Country somewhat concerns us, by the alliance of this Prince Elector to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> we will be a little larger, for full satisfaction and in∣formation of the Reader, in the whole series of the late Affairs of that Family, than we have hi∣therto been; but according to proportion, the Lower <HI>Palatinate,</HI> which is all the Dominion of this Prince, being in bredth but 90. Miles, and in length 72. It is one of the most pleasant Coun∣tries of <HI>Germany,</HI> and affords the best <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wires; the Princes alwayes, till this late mis∣fortune, reputed the wisest, as who had enlarged their Estates, and from the beginning raised it from nothing, being meer Courtiers, or great Officers at first, although else acknowledged to be the Descen∣dents of <HI>Charlemaign.</HI></P>
<PB N="197" REF="110"/>
<P>In this Grandeur these Princes continued till the Year 1620. when the Family seemed to have re∣ceived the greatest accession and accrument of Feli∣city, by the Marriage of <HI>Frederick</HI> the 5th. (Ne∣phew to Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> by his Sister <HI>Louisa,</HI> married to <HI>Frederick</HI> the 4th.) with our Princess <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Daughter of King <HI>James,</HI> some time before; and his Investiture in the Crown of <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> by the Election of those States; who indeed, by the Concession of many Princes, of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> themselves (Letters reversate they call them) and by their own Customes and Privileges, had right thereunto; but the choice and acceptation thereof, being not so free and voluntary on his part, for that some affronts were like to be put upon him by the Chamber of <HI>Spires,</HI> who were ready to proceed to Sentence against him, for his demolishing <HI>Udenheim,</HI> which the Bishop of <HI>Spires,</HI> whose Town it was, was then a fortifying; which <HI>Spinola</HI> afterwards took in hand, and finished, and called it <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> now in the possession of the <HI>French.</HI> The Reader is here to understand, that in this Lower <HI>Palatinate,</HI> there are several famous Imperial Towns and Bishopricks, as <HI>Worms, Spires,</HI> although Feudatories, for the most part of their Estates, to the Princes Electors.</P>
<P>No sooner was the <HI>Palatine</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> but the War began to flame in <HI>Germany,</HI> portend∣ed by a fearful Comet in 1618. in the first Battel whereof at <HI>Prague,</HI> the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> assisted by <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI>'s <HI>Transylvanians,</HI> and <HI>Hunga∣rians,</HI> was totally routed by Count <HI>Bucquoy,</HI> the young Prince of <HI>Anhalt</HI> slain, a great slaughter
<PB N="198" REF="111"/>made, and <HI>Prague</HI> soon after taken: This Battel was fought on the 5th. of <HI>November</HI> 1620. and thereupon the King, as he was then called, fled to <HI>Breslaw</HI> in <HI>Silesia,</HI> where he secured himself, com∣mitting the care of his Estate to the Marquess of <HI>Anspach,</HI> who was General of the Confederate Pro∣testant Princes; but being corrupted by <HI>Spinola</HI>'s Gold, who was sent for out of the <HI>Low Countries</HI> to attaque the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> basely sold it, and the Prince's Interest; by which means <HI>Spinola</HI> shortly after reduced <HI>Manheim</HI> and <HI>Frankendale,</HI> Garri∣soned by the <HI>English,</HI> but hopeless of relief. Soon after King <HI>Frederick</HI> withdrew into <HI>Holland,</HI> ex∣pecting some new undertake of his Quarrel, and the Protestant Interest, of which <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the 2d. Emperour, was a most violent and bitter Ene∣my. And here he heard the issue of the <HI>Danish</HI> War, more to his disadvantage, till the <HI>Swede</HI> en∣tred <HI>Germany,</HI> when he followed that King, and was by him, upon some hard terms, restored to his Estates, which he enjoyed not long, deceasing at <HI>Mentz, November</HI> 29. 1632.</P>
<P>But soon after his death, and the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>'s, at the Battel of <HI>Lutzen,</HI> the Imperialists over-ran the Country again, having routed and broke the <HI>Swedish</HI> Power at the Battel of <HI>Nordlin∣gen;</HI> and although some Efforts were made by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with some Forces out of <HI>Holland,</HI> in which service, my Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> and other <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen were engaged; yet were they finally vanquished, and driven out of the Country, and hardly put to it by swimming to make their escapes. So that the Country continued sequestred

Ele∣ctoral Office, together with all the Appurtenances of it, and the County of <HI>Cham</HI> besides, was con∣ferred upon his Counn of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> of the <HI>Guliel∣min</HI> Line, this being the Elder, and called the <HI>Ro∣dulphin;</HI> but the Younger is farr more rich and powerful, and the greatest Enemy to the other: This Dignity and Estate being given the <HI>Bavarian</HI> for his assistance of the Emperour with Men and Money in this War. By the same Treaty, the Emperour was likewise to give the Elector's young∣er Brothers and Sisters their Portions in ready Mo∣ney; which, <HI>Pro benevolo</HI> Caesareo <HI>affectu in domum Palatinam,</HI> as the words run, he did assent to, and punctually pay and perform.</P>
<P>This Prince now quietly enjoyes what he had by that Treaty, and hath been highly carressed by the present Emperour. He hath married a Daughter of the House of <HI>Hassia,</HI> between which Family and his there have been frequent Marches. As to his Interest, it lyes in a general Peace and Amity with all Princes, but especially with the Empe∣rour, and next the Protestant Party, and princi∣pally those of the <HI>Calvinian</HI> way, which is the Re∣ligion professed in his Country, and of which he was the Chief and Head in <HI>Europe.</HI> His Alliance leads him to respect the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Den∣mark;</HI> and this King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Father was born of his Aunt: The Family of <HI>Nassaw</HI> and he are likewise near in Blood, his Grandmother being the

<P>We come next to a brief view of the Upper <HI>Pa∣latinate,</HI> transferted, with the County of <HI>Cham,</HI> to the House of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> whose Duke <HI>Ludovicus,</HI> Emperour also of <HI>Germany,</HI> upon the partition of Estate, resigned it for ever, some Ages since, to <HI>Rodulphus</HI> his elder Brother; who, in right of his Mother <HI>Gertrude,</HI> the Daughter, and sole Heir of <HI>Henry,</HI> Count Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> was in∣vested in all those Dominions and Dignities. In this Province is seated <HI>Newburg,</HI> the Title of the second Branch of the House <HI>Palatine,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Cleve,</HI> in share with the Marquess of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI> Here is also the City of <HI>Noremberg,</HI> famous for its rate workmanships, a fine and beautiful Town, yet no River near it, but the curious Industry of the People supplyes that defect. The Country ve∣ry near as bigg as the Lower, but nothing so plea∣sant and fruitful, being chiefly mountainous and barren, except in Mines of Iron, and some of Si∣ver, one of which is very considerable: So that it is a great retrenchment and dismembring of the <HI>Palatine</HI> Patrimony; but what cannot be cur'd, must be endur'd: And so we pass to <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>It is bounded on the North with the Upper <HI>Pa∣latinate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">8. Bavaria.</NOTE> on the West with <HI>Schwaben,</HI> and on the East and South with <HI>Austria, Tirol,</HI> and <HI>Carinthia;</HI> divided into three parts, the Higher, the Lower, and the Bishoprick of <HI>Saltzburg,</HI> a District, and
<PB N="201" REF="112"/>distinct Jurisdiction of it's self. The Country ge∣nerally overspread with Woods, and cold, and barren; but the Lower somewhat more fruitful, and abundantly more pleasant. In the Higher is seated <HI>Munchen,</HI> famous for it's seizure by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who found infinite Treasure there∣in; and for that it is the Residence of the Dukes of <HI>Bavaria:</HI> In the Lower <HI>Ingolstadt,</HI> farr more fa∣mous, for that it put the first affront upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and made him give o∣ver the siege thereof. 2. <HI>Regensburg,</HI> or <HI>Ratis∣bone,</HI> famous for the Diets held there, being a most beautiful and pleasant Fabrick; and <HI>Passaw,</HI> as eminent in former times, for divers Consultati∣ons held there by the Princes, and for the notable Diet made there, by <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. in favour of the Protestants. As to the District of <HI>Saltzburg,</HI> it is a barrener Country than the Higher <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and considerable for nothing more, than that their Bishop challengeth the precedency of all other Ec∣clesiasticks, except the three Electors. It borders upon <HI>Austria,</HI> which shall limit this Discourse of <HI>Germany,</HI> because we will consider the Hereditary Provinces together, when we come to <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Actions and Designes there, as more pro∣per for that place, though with some disorderly revulsion of this great Body.</P>
<P>The Interest of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> is very con∣siderable, he being look'd upon as one of the po∣tentest and richest Princes in <HI>Germany,</HI> or indeed in <HI>Europe;</HI> for he was paid in both hands for his service in <HI>Germany;</HI> and Duke <HI>Maximilian</HI> was else very much afore-hand with the World, as his
<PB N="202" REF="113"/>Loans to the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the 2d. suffici∣ently manifested. The present Duke is a most zealous violent Catholick, as was his Father, and therefore sure to the Emperour, as well as by his Alliance, being born or this Emperour's great Aunt, married young to old gouty <HI>Maximilian,</HI> who, by some prolifick Cordials, got for him by the Jesuites, had Issue by her, but the present Duke, and his Brother, are of weak Constituti∣ons. The Jesuites have also alwayes had a mighty influence upon this Court, so that no doubt is to be made of the Duke's forwardness in the War a∣gainst the <HI>Turks,</HI> to which the Duke offered him∣self upon condition he should be made General; notwithstanding he will, and hath advanced alrea∣dy some very considerable Supplyes, by way of Loan; and as to his Proportions rated upon him, they will be ready with the formost, and are likest to do the best service, for that they are accustom∣ed to the Fruits and Wines of that Country, ha∣ving none of their own, any being Neighbours to that. By this Electors Voice, the Papacy hath five Votes against three, in any Matter; and in the Vacancy of the Empire, a pretension, and forci∣ble exercise of the <HI>Vicuriat,</HI> which belonged to the <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> not as Elector, but as Count of that Circle, as he alleges, and so did not forfeit that right. And it is concluded also, that if the present Emperour dyes without aged Issue, the Imperial Dignity will be given to the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> who is the only Catholick Prince (not reckoning the Arch-dukes of <HI>Tirol</HI> and <HI>Inspruck,</HI> as nothing considerable without the Patrimony of <HI>Austria,</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="113"/>and whom we shall mention there) of power and ability to support the Empire. And it was this Dukedom that in effect bore up the <HI>Austrian</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> and came off with Victory at last: And so we return by <HI>Fran∣conia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>FRANCONIA</HI> is bounded on the East with the Upper <HI>Palatinate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">9. Fran∣conia.</NOTE> on the South with the <HI>Palatinate</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> on the West with <HI>Wet∣teraw;</HI> and on the North with <HI>Hassia,</HI> &amp;c. It is governed by many distinct Princes, some of great∣er, others of lesser Power and Dominion; but the Title of the whole, since the failer of the <HI>French</HI> Dukes (for the present Inhabitants are de∣scended of the old <HI>French</HI>) is given to the Bishop of <HI>Wurtzburg.</HI> The Country a fine, pleasant, fruitful Seat (but skirted with great thick Woods) and the People good-conditioned, and indu∣strious.</P>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>Wurtzburg,</HI> as he hath the Title of the whole Dutchy, which is also called the Cir∣cle of <HI>Franconia;</HI> so hath he a large and spacious Territory, and the largest Revenue of any one Bi∣shop in <HI>Germany:</HI> Next to him, in this Province, is the Bishop of <HI>Bamberg,</HI> once bigger than now it is, but yet of a competent Jurisdiction, exempt from any subordination to the Metropolitan. Both these Bishops are Princes of the Empire, and, as their Religion obliges them, firm Adherers to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and the Papacy; and there∣fore very jealous of their Neighbours, the Prote∣stant Estates, that conjoyn to them, having suffered exceedingly in the <HI>Swedish</HI> War.</P>
<PB N="204" REF="114"/>
<P>The Marquess of <HI>Anspach,</HI> a Descendent of the House or <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> that Marquess, who was chosen General by the Princes of the Union, for the Defence of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> 1620. being the youngest. Brother of the Grand-father of the present Elector, who treacherously suffered <HI>Spino∣la,</HI> unfought with, to reduce the whole Country, his Son <HI>Christian</HI> is now the present Marquess, and is obliged to follow the Interest of the elder House. There are in this Circle also the Earldoms of <HI>Henneberg, Hohenlo, Rhesneck, Swartzen∣burg,</HI> &amp;c. the last of which hath yielded abundance of gallant Persons, and the Family at this day in great estimation. As for Imperial Cities, it is not without its proportion; but especially <HI>Frank∣furt</HI> is most considerable, not only for its famous Mart, especially of Books, but for the Election of the <HI>German</HI> Emperour. These several Estates do live in good Peace and Correspondence, having smarted for their former Divisions sufficiently: And so we proceed to the Dukedom of <HI>Swevia,</HI> or the Circle of <HI>Schwaben.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SCHWABEN</HI> is bounded on the East with <HI>Bavaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.

Here the Family of the <HI>Fug∣gers,</HI> a wealthy and splendid Barony, and who have enlarged their Patrimony by Merchandise, contrary to the custom of Nobles in <HI>Germany,</HI> have great and ample Possessions. I mention this Family the rather, because he is at present one of the Major Generals of the <HI>Rix</HI> Army, designed against the <HI>Turk.</HI> In the third Division stands that memorable Town of <HI>Brisach,</HI> seated upon the top of a Mountain, and strongly fortified, and as pleasantly built, but incommodated for want of Water, having but one Well, and the Water which, with much trouble, they bring from the <HI>Rhine,</HI> that runs at the foot of the said Mountain. In the fourth part stands <HI>Norlingen,</HI> famous for the great and fatal Overthrow given the <HI>Swedes</HI> there, by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the 3d. where General <HI>Banier</HI> was slain, and General <HI>Horn</HI> taken Prisoner, and the Duke of <HI>Weymor</HI> put to his shifts, by whose un-ad∣visedness the <HI>Swedes</HI> were engaged. <HI>Furstenburg,</HI> which gives Title to the Earls thereof, Princes of the Empire, and Men eminent in their Generati∣ons. And lastly, <HI>Ulme,</HI> the chief among many other Imperial Cities in this Tract. Nothing more remains to be said of this Region, but that there is no Person that pretends Title to it, the Dukes thereof being long since extinguished, and their Patrimony dismembred among the petty Princes, and Imperial Towns (save that the Arch-dukes of <HI>Austria</HI> enjoy <HI>Brisgow,</HI> by vertue of a Purchase
<PB N="206" REF="115"/>made with the Proprietor (some Ages since) di∣sturbed in his Possession by rebellious Subjects) who have well feathered their Nests therewith. There hath nothing of Feud passed in this Cir∣cle since the Treaty: And so we proceed to <HI>Wetteraw.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WETTERAW</HI> is bounded on the East with <HI>Franconia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">11. Wet∣teraw.</NOTE> on the South with the Lower <HI>Palati∣nate,</HI> on the West with <HI>Colen,</HI> and on the North with <HI>Hassia;</HI> It consists of several petty Estates confederated together, <HI>viz.</HI> Of the Counts of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Hanaw</HI> and <HI>Solins,</HI> the Ba∣ron of <HI>Lichteberg,</HI> and two Imperial Cities. The County of <HI>Nassaw</HI> is a most pleasant fruitful Place; and the Original of that Noble Family, who, by Marriage of <HI>Engelbert</HI> the 7th. Count of this Title, with <HI>Mary,</HI> the Daughter and Heir of <HI>Philip,</HI> Lord of <HI>Breda,</HI> became possessed of the City and Castle, and a large Territory into the bargain, improved by many additions; by which means his Successors became first Subjects to the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and after to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who endangered the Head of Prince <HI>William</HI> the 2d. and afterwards caused him to be assassinated. Con∣cerning their Title of <HI>Orange,</HI> which is of above a 100. Years more modern Title, we shall speak of it in our view of <HI>France;</HI> but it is also here to be remembred, that the Counts of <HI>Nassaw</HI> are of late years also Earls of <HI>Buren,</HI> by the Marriage of <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> (eldest Son of the abovesaid Prince <HI>William,</HI> kept Prisoner by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to his death) with the Heir of the Earl of <HI>Egmond,</HI> to whom this <HI>Bu∣ren,</HI> seated as before in <HI>Gelderland,</HI> did belong:
<PB N="207" REF="115"/>The Reader is to understand, that there are three several Branches of this Family, as that of Count <HI>William,</HI> Governour of <HI>Freisland,</HI> and the other of <HI>Weilborough;</HI> yet notwithstanding, in case this present Prince, Son of the late Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> Sister of our Soveraign, and Prince <HI>William</HI> the 3d. should dye without Issue, the greatest part of all these noble Estates, but this of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> together with the Title of Count <HI>Catzenbogen</HI> (a Town seated herein, but sold, after much difference and contest, to the Lantgrave of <HI>Hassia,</HI> who pre∣tended a right to it) goes to the Marquess of <HI>Bran∣denburg,</HI> who married a Daughter of the Family of <HI>Orange;</HI> as by Contract with the <HI>French</HI> King, he is certain of that Principality: This Family is ally∣ed to the greatest in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Earldom of <HI>Hanaw,</HI> and Lordship of <HI>Lichteberg,</HI> belong to the first and second Bran∣ches of the same House, and are a very Illustrious Family for Descent and Territory, but must give place to the Count of <HI>Solins</HI> for Antiquity; and in all times highly esteemed for their personal worth, much advanced in reputation of late, by the Mar∣riage of one of the late Earls thereof, with one of the Sisters of Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and afterwards with the Widow of the Earl of <HI>Egmond;</HI> and very re∣cently, by the Marriage of a Daughter of that House, to Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> who proved the Mo∣ther of <HI>William,</HI> the Father of this present Prince of <HI>Aurange.</HI></P>
<P>As to the two Imperial Cities, <HI>Friberg,</HI> and <HI>Wetzelaer,</HI> they comply with their Neighbours in the same Combination; the Religion profess'd
<PB N="208" REF="116"/>here being <HI>Calvinian</HI> altogether, but the Disci∣pline and Pride thereof mollified and accommoda∣ted to the Government, and the Peoples temper, as it is served in most places of <HI>Germany,</HI> where it hath been received.</P>
<P>We pass now to the Dutchy of <HI>Wittenburg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12. Wit∣tenburg:</NOTE> and the Marquisate of <HI>Baden,</HI> and will suffer them to go joyned together, as we find them in Geography; and they are thus bounded; on two parts, South and East, with <HI>Swevia;</HI> on the West with the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and <HI>Brisgow,</HI> another part of <HI>Swevia;</HI> on the North with the Lower <HI>Palatinate;</HI> they are divided from one another by a high ridge of Hills. <HI>Wittenburg</HI> is, for the most part, a plentiful Country, but to∣wards the edges, and hath been the Dominion of many Martial Dukes, to which the present is no way inferiour: For want of Military Employment at home, he would have served the <HI>French,</HI> in the late War against the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and should have been General of the Horse, being highly cares∣sed by that King; but that War being compo∣sed, he is now engaged in the service against the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>His Revenue is very considerable, for the Earl∣dom of <HI>Montletgard</HI> in <HI>Alsatia,</HI> omitted there pur∣posely, as to be reduced to this Estate, to which it hath belonged for many Ages, but lately some part thereof hath been seized by the <HI>French;</HI> who, after they had got <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Alsatia,</HI> stick'd at the Strong Holds of this Country; the Principal whereof, <HI>viz. Montletgard,</HI> being strongly seat∣ed on the top of a Mountain, under pretence of securing it for some younger Descendent of this
<PB N="209" REF="116"/>Family, whose right it was, they yet keep in their hands; as they do the Principality of <HI>Aurange,</HI> upon the same score: But his Towns are very de∣ficient in all furniture of Ammunition, and war∣like Provision, otherwise he would not be inferi∣our to most of the Princes; And yet a Magazine should concern this Prince, for he is alwayes in Fend with the free Cities, of which there are six in his Dutchy of <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> as <HI>Wimpten, Hail∣bran,</HI> on the <HI>Neccar,</HI> &amp;c. But it is hazardous to begin new Troubles in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>The Marquisate of <HI>Baden</HI> is a great deal less con∣siderable, although it have the Earldom of <HI>Hoch∣berg</HI> joyned to it, but that advantage is reciproca∣ted by a disadvantage, that the Patrimony is par∣ted between two Families, this of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the younger, that of <HI>Baden Durlach;</HI> who, by the Imperial Constitution, is a Field Officer against the <HI>Turks</HI> this <HI>Campagnia.</HI> Concerning the Inte∣rests of these Princes, little is to be said, for all things were so lulled and secured by the Treaty at <HI>Munster,</HI> that scarce any Seeds remain of any Dis∣content; but if any such there be, Prudence will conceal them.</P>
<P>Having thus traversed a great part of the Mid∣land, we will make a transition to the Eastermost parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and in our return thence take in all the rest of the Country, being hindred from a methodical Conjunction of it, by the omission of the Hereditary Dominions; and therefore we shall next survey <HI>Brandenburg.</HI></P>
<P>This Province is bounded on the East with the Kingdom of <HI>Poland;</HI> on the South with <HI>Lusatia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">13. Bran∣denburg.</NOTE>
<PB N="210" REF="117"/><HI>Silesia,</HI> and <HI>Misnia;</HI> on the West with <HI>Saxony;</HI> and on the North with <HI>Pomerania.</HI> It contains 180. <HI>English</HI> Miles in length, and as much in bredth, which makes up 410. Miles in compass; plentiful of Corn, but not thick inhabited, nor well furnished with other accommodation. It is called, the <HI>Marck</HI> of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> because they were the antient <HI>Marcks</HI> of the Empire, divided into the old <HI>Marcks,</HI> and the middle or upper <HI>Marcks,</HI> in which is <HI>Berlin,</HI> the Marquess's Resi∣dence; extending from the River <HI>Odera</HI> (which distinguisheth another <HI>Frankfort,</HI> abounding in Corn and Wine) to the Borders of <HI>Poland;</HI> Be∣sides this, he is possessed of the <HI>Ducal Prussia,</HI> and the share of the Dukedomes of <HI>Cleve,</HI> the reversi∣on of the Bishopricks of <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> the possessi∣on of <HI>Halberstadt, Minden,</HI> and <HI>Camire,</HI> with Title of Prince and Duke thereof, which he had in lieu of his resignation of the higher Dutchy of <HI>Po∣meren,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>The Revenue of this Prince, notwithstanding these large Territories, is computed to be nothing considerable, not to amount to above 200000. at the utmost, but certainly they reckon without their Host; for although his Intrado be not any where exactly made out, yet the effects thereof do declare some greater matter; for what Armies did he maintain in the late <HI>Polish</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> War, for six Years together, without any impairing of
<PB N="211" REF="117"/>his Dominions, and his Souldiers constantly paid? And if it be said; that he had a Purse before-stand, it will appear, that his constant Charge in Peace would consume such a summ, by the multitude of Garrisons he keeps, with such incident Expences. Most certain it is, that his Puissance is answerable to most of his Neighbour Princes, not hath he wanted Conduct and Fortune answerable there∣unto.</P>
<P>His Interest is to keep a firm and good under∣standing with the <HI>Hollander,</HI> whom he knows how to use to his advantage; and because of his Expect∣ations there, if the Prince of <HI>Aurange</HI> should de∣cease a Minor without Issue. He hath respects for the Family of the Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> whose Sister he married; and at whose instance he would have in∣troduced the <HI>Calvinian</HI> for the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Professi∣on, but found it too hot for his fingers; never∣theless he exerciseth the <HI>Calvinian</HI> way in his pri∣vate Chapel, according to his Stipulation with his then mutinous Subjects. He is in good and per∣fect amity with the Emperour, and all the Prote∣stant Princes; with the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> and he reconciled, but he stands upon his Guard in that Point. In the first beginning of the Reformation, there was some Difference betwixt <HI>Albert</HI> of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and <HI>John Frederick</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> but ever since they have continued Friends, for it was a Difference in Religion, the <HI>Saxon</HI> being then a <HI>Lutheran.</HI> He was first proposed as General against the <HI>Turks,</HI> but he declined it; but his rated numbers, with some super-numerary supply, will be advanced by
<PB N="212" REF="118"/>him; besides, he will be necessitated to keep some considerable: Forces in readiness, if the <HI>Turks,</HI> by some sudden Incursion, should ever pass through <HI>Silesia,</HI> as they have often attempted to get into it: And so we proceed to <HI>Pome∣rania.</HI></P>

This Dut∣chy is rated its Proportions for the <HI>Turkish</HI> War, which the <HI>Swede</HI> is not to exceed: And so we pass to <HI>Mecklenburg.</HI></P>

The Son of this <HI>Weymar</HI> proved as gallant a Person as his Father against the Emperour, and was made <HI>Generalissimo</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> Forces in <HI>Germany,</HI> but he dyed soon after, and in him by report that Family is extinct: But to return, for we must not stand to enumerate all Particulars in this mighty Province. The other Part is meerly Feudatory, and that scarcely per∣formed, 1. The Princes of <HI>Anhalt</HI> indeed owe some kind of dependence to this Duke, but they are free Princes of the Empire, and have proved excellent Warriours, and Favourers of the Refor∣mation; <HI>Christian</HI> the young Prince thereof, fal∣ling unhappily in the quarrel of the Count <HI>Pala∣tine,</HI> at the Battel of <HI>Prague;</HI> and the Interest of this Family is still the same, although in former
<PB N="215" REF="119"/>times highly honoured by the Emperours, and in∣deed not yet dis-respected by them. They are by Religion <HI>Calvinists.</HI></P>
<P>The Counts of <HI>Mansfield</HI> have almost traced the same steps of Military Glory after those of <HI>Arhalt,</HI> and their Revenue almost as considerable, part of their Estate being in Mortgage to the Dukes of <HI>Saxony,</HI> but neither o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ment to enterprize any thing of themselves; for the late Count <HI>Mans∣field</HI>'s sudden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the motions and actions, and keep∣ing his men together, oo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me to day, and getting as many more speedlly after, were rather Miracles, than the Effects of Reason. This Family is still in being, and thinks it best yet to be quiet.</P>
<P>As to the Bishop of <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> that Title was abolished by the Reformation, the <HI>Magdeburgers</HI> putting themselves sometimes under the Protection of the <HI>Brandenburger,</HI> and sometime of the <HI>Saxon,</HI> with the Title of Administrator, which <HI>Augustus,</HI> the Brother of this Duke enjoyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as afore∣said. And as much as sufficeth hath been said of the fourth Member of this second Part, the Dutchy of <HI>Lawenburg,</HI> which depends dutifully upon this Elder House.</P>
<P>The Revenue of this Prince is computed at 400000 <HI>l.</HI> double to that of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> ari∣sing partly out of his Silver Mines, which yield 140000 <HI>l.</HI> of the Money; and next, out of his Salt, made at <HI>Hall,</HI> and the Excise of Beer, which amounts to great summs; Besides, he levies a con∣stant Tax for Provision, and maintenance of a War against the <HI>Turks,</HI> although in the most serenest
<PB N="216" REF="120"/>times: With this Revenue he keepeth a splendid Court, at his Residence of <HI>Dresden,</HI> and main∣taineth a noble Magazine, out of which, in a dayes time, he can furnish out Armes for above 30000. Horse and Foot; Here also he hath a Stable, which will hold 128. Horses, fit for service; both the Horse, and the Armes, so neatly kept, of which there is at least 12000. for Horse, with 80. Can∣non, and Demi-Culverins, and 170. other Cul∣verins, and Sakers; Besides which Magazine, all the Cities and Towns have Armories of their own, well kept and provided, nor are the Gentry unprovided.</P>
<P>By which it appears, that this Prince is the most Considerable in <HI>Germany,</HI> as well as by that advan∣tage and disadvantage he did the <HI>Swedes,</HI> first by ad∣hering, and then relinquishing them, by a Neu∣trality with the Emperour. His Alliances also with all the Protestant Princes, and the Common Inte∣rest of them all, which hath its dernier resort hi∣ther, as it rendred him in former tsmes suspect to the Emperours, who never liked so much Great∣ness in any House but their own; so is it not plea∣sing now to the Catholique Princes and States, and especially the House of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Ecclesi∣astiques. There lately happened a quarrel in this Dukes Territory of <HI>Turingia,</HI> at <HI>Erford,</HI> an Uni∣versity, to which the Bishop of <HI>Mentz</HI> layes claim, as founded and built by his Predecessors; but they having shaken off that Soveraignty, in the time of that Founder, by name <HI>William,</HI> the Son of the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the 2d. have since dis∣claimed any other Power, but what they exercise
<PB N="217" REF="120"/>themselves, as a Hanse and Free City of the Em∣pire; having the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> for their Patron, and good Neighbour; and who, by interessing himself for them, ceased those troubles which were like to arise between the Bishop and them, in this unhappy Juncture.</P>
<P>He is obliged to do something extraordinary a∣gainst the <HI>Turk,</HI> for that Taxes sake, which he hath received for so many Years together, with∣out any occasion of disbursement; yet his Subjects do not much care for that War in person, and would wish the Money bestowed in hiring of Mer∣cenaries, for they march heavy, and laden with Weapons, and Bottles, and a Baggage behind, without which a <HI>Saxon</HI> is no-body in the Field: So we pass to <HI>Brunswick</HI> and <HI>Lunenburg.</HI></P>

In strong Obligations upon the Pope, since the kindness of the Emperours, <HI>Phocas,</HI> and <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the First; 2. On the (now useful) Title to the 17. Provinces, by the Marriage of <HI>Maximilian</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> with <HI>Mary,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Burgundy;</HI> 3. In the many Inter-Marriages

<P>It were not amiss likewise, that <HI>Anstria</HI> left its State-pretences of Liberty, under a Christian Em∣perour, urged by it so long, till it was almost en∣slaved to an Infidel; That it ceased limiting its Arch-Dukes Authority to Command it, before he lose his Power to Protect it; That it quit its Fears and Jealousies touching Religion and Privileges, before it have none to be afraid or jealous of : It being never likely to be well in <HI>Germany,</HI> till the Princes, and the free Cities agree, who shall <HI>Obey;</HI> the Emperour, and the Princes consent, who shall <HI>Command;</HI> the Catholiques and Prote∣stants set down what is Christianity: <HI>Obedience</HI> o∣therwise being likely to become a <HI>Snare, Autho∣rity</HI> a <HI>Name,</HI> and <HI>Christianity</HI> a State of <HI>Infidelity.</HI> Besides that, the Arch-Dukes hereof (branched

A Country that can endure neither its <HI>Mise∣ries,</HI> nor the <HI>Remedies</HI> of them; neither the wast∣ing War of the <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> nor the suspected Peace of the Empire; especially since the People here are so long used to War, that they know not how to live in Peace; being so lazy that they can∣not work, they will be so troublesome as to fight for their Livelyhood; and when the <HI>Turk</HI> doth not make it necessary for the Emperour to <HI>defend</HI> him∣self, the <HI>Hungarians</HI> make it more than necessary for him to <HI>offend</HI> others. A rich, but trouble∣some Clergy they had, which <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Em∣perour brought to Stipends and Pensions. Great Privileges they boasted of, since King <HI>Andrew</HI>'s time; but they are undone if they lose them not, (for while they are disputing whether <HI>Elective</HI> or <HI>Hereditary,</HI> whether they have not Power to op∣pose their King, in case he wrongs them, they are hardly a Nation worth the enjoying, or a People worth the governing) the <HI>Turk</HI> having swallowed up almost two Parts of three. While they are an∣gry with their Master, the Emperour, that they had not the pleasure to laugh at his ruine, and their own (for some People had rather be <HI>undone</HI> than <HI>governed</HI>) he having clapped up so sudden a Peace, it's well they have so much <HI>Wit</HI> in their <HI>Anger,</HI> as yet to fortifie their Borders; Particularly, 1. <HI>Ra∣ab</HI> (on the meeting of the <HI>Danube</HI> with the River <HI>Raab</HI>) 2. <HI>Castlenovo;</HI> 3. <HI>Gomorrha,</HI> an Island en∣circled by the <HI>Danube;</HI> 4. <HI>Fyleck,</HI> the Place that

<P><HI>Lentulus</HI> would say of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> then called <HI>Pannonians</HI> antiently, <HI>That they were so un∣constant, that there was no governing them, but by Cittadels; so unruly, that they knew no other Kings, but their Landlords; that they understood no Duty, but towards a General; and that they owned no Reli∣gion, but Liberty.</HI> And I may add of <HI>Hungary,</HI> what they say of <HI>Scotland,</HI> That as long as the Peo∣ple hang so much on the Nobility, and the Priest∣hood, neither Nobility nor Priesthood will stick to the King: Since they are so subtile and proud, it's well they are so voluptuous, and that their wit and malice is <HI>softned</HI> by their <HI>pleasures.</HI> It's some secu∣rity, that a Faction is deboished, especially here, where none comes to undoe the Common-wealth, but a <HI>Sober Man;</HI> it being an Hermit that first taught <HI>Hungary</HI> that dangerous way of Marrying Noblemens Children as soon as born, and entring them in a Combination, as soon as they are matri∣culated <HI>Christians.</HI> It's a wonder the Emperour cannot as well be rid of the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Hungary,</HI> as the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is of the Justice of <HI>Arragon,</HI> both whom pretending a Power between King and People, usurped an Authority over both; not easily checked, unless, as <HI>Albertus,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> got the Title to the Kingdom, by mar∣rying the King's Daughter 1431. so his Successors may keep Possession, by marrying the <HI>Palatine</HI>'s: The <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and the <HI>Welshmen,</HI> agreeing in
<PB N="226" REF="126"/>this, that they would willingly be governed by none but their own <HI>Natives.</HI></P>
<P>But rather than insist on these Niceties, it be∣comes these desolate People, 1. To fix upon some Principles that may unite these divided States; 2. That they promote the general Peace of <HI>Christen∣dom;</HI> 3. That they provide good Shipping upon the <HI>Danube;</HI> 4. That they Victual and Garrison the Frontier Towns already erected, and erect more; 5. That they set up the Profession of Reli∣gion, in so decent a way, as may work upon their Neighbour <HI>Turks,</HI> a Reverence at least <HI>of,</HI> if not a Respect <HI>for</HI> it; 6. That they observe those Dissen∣tions that grow among the Infidels, and make use of their Discontents to weaken their Power: A Lesson they might well learn from the very <HI>Turks</HI> themselves, who have invaded <HI>Hungary</HI> now 8. times, upon no other Encouragement, than the Contests that they have had among themselves a∣bout Religion, and the Quarrels with their Liege Lords about Liberty; 7. That they prosecute the Mines that yield the Emperour 162000 <HI>l.</HI> and em∣ploy 10000. idle men, that might be worse busi∣ed: And encourage Tillage, where Wheat is high∣er than a man's head, Vines over-top the Trees, Grass groweth up to the Knees, and the Woods threaten the Clouds; And 8. That they train their Foot to as much Expertness, as they do their Horse; that the <HI>Bandi</HI> may be as eminent amongst them, as their <HI>Heyduchs:</HI> to which purpose, a ve∣terane Army of 3000.

<P>NOW we have gone round the Circle, we finish where we began, in that fortunate Island, if there be any in the VVorld: If all men, as I, that travelled, understood either their own, or their Nations <HI>Happiness. England,</HI> in its Re∣stauration a Miracle, and in its Settlement a VVonder. 1. At Peace with <HI>Spain,</HI> 2. Allied to <HI>Portugal,</HI> 3. Inward with <HI>Denmark,</HI> 4. Court∣ed by <HI>Sweden,</HI> 5. Addressed unto by the Empe∣rour, 6. Caressed by the Princes, 7. Despaired of by the Pope, 8. Admired by the <HI>Turk,</HI> 9. Ap∣plauded by the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> 10. Feared by the In∣fidels, 11. Suspected by the <HI>French,</HI> 12. And Affronted only by the <HI>Dutch:</HI> A People it hath set up, when in their lowest Estate; and pulled down, when in their highest: To whom it hath been the best Friend, and the worst Enemy; whose Sea maintains them, whose Fish relieves them, whose Commodities employ them, and whose Trade hath hitherto upheld them.</P>
<PB N="253" REF="139"/>
<P><HI>England</HI> now, as of old, the Ballance of <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI> giving Law, with its Armes, to <HI>Africa,</HI> and its Princes; opening the way, by its Com∣merce, to the Wines and Sugars of <HI>Spain,</HI> to the Treasure of the <HI>Indies,</HI> to the Manufactures of <HI>Turkey,</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> to the Cordage, and Naval Materials of <HI>Muscovy, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> to the Delicacies of <HI>Italy,</HI> to the Kersies of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> to the Wines of <HI>Burdeaux;</HI> and whatever owneth the Name of <HI>Necessary</HI> or <HI>Convenient.</HI> Improving its Native Commodities with the great∣est Art at home, and Exporting them with the highest Freedom abroad.</P>
<P>Its First Interest is Intelligence and Negotiation; and the World understands, how Active a Person it employes in <HI>Holland,</HI> how Wise a Man it hath set∣led in <HI>France,</HI> how Grave an Ambassadour it main∣tains in <HI>Spain;</HI> and what Reserved, Prudent, and Noble Agents, it hath dispatched to <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden;</HI> not to mention the Honourable Person re∣sident at the <HI>Grand Seigniour</HI>'s Court.</P>
<P>Its Second is Trade, and the Dominion of the Sea; and it's not unknown, what Expert Captains are trusted, what Multitudes of Seamen are bred up, what Provisions are made for Fishing, what Laws are in force for the Vending of Fish, what Correspondence is kept with the Northern Coasts for Cordage, how many and strong Vessels are built; what Stores and Magazines, even beyond what ever was known, are set up; how blessed a Prince, who makes it his business to understand and manage the Sea Affairs; how Royal an Admiral, the King's only Brother; what Noble Officers, all
<PB N="254" REF="140"/>the Nobility, choosing rather a Ship at Sea, than a Court by Land; how willing the Kingdom is to float upon the Sea, how watchful the Commis∣sioners of the Navy are to guide it, and how vigi∣lant His Majesty, and his Honourable Council is upon all; what formidable Preparations, what a∣bundance of gallant Men, what skillful Buil∣ders, what expert Seamen, what valiant Com∣manders; and, in a word, what a brave Admiral, whose conduct, diligence, and success, is known to the World.</P>
<P>Its Third Interest is the Protestant Religion, which it encourageth abroad, and hath setled at home; where the Laws against Recusants of both sides, the Papists, and the Separatist, are very strict; the Uniformity distinct from them both, is very orderly; Our Doctrine, how confessedly Or∣thodox; Our Devotion, how avowedly whole∣some; Our Ceremonies, how famously decent; Our Discipline, how admirably primitive; and our Order, how honourably antient! Our Peo∣ple submitting humbly to their Guides, they to their Overseers, they to their Soveraign, and all to the Word of God, the confessed general Coun∣cils, and the primitive practice. Ministers are restored to their Right, and Bishops to their Pow∣er, Jurisdictions are established, Courts are o∣pened, a Terrour hangs over evill doers, and En∣couragements are set before those that do well: Favours are derived to merit, and Preferments to worth; and a man may be as good as he will, and as great as he deserveth. The Honour of Religi∣on, and its Clergy, is asserted; the Levity and Pe∣tulancy
<PB N="255" REF="140"/>of the Populacy is restrained; and every one knoweth his own place, where they serve one God, in one Faith, by one Baptism, in one Spirit, in one hope of one common Salvation.</P>
<P>Its Fourth Interest is Unity, the Head whereof is an excellent Prince, made up of power and sweetness, who is feared and loved, whose Veins swell with all the Royal Blood of this Kingdom, and whose Soul is thronged with all the Virtues of its Kings; so that his Right is as undoubted as his Possession, and his Merit as his Right: And the awe upon all men arising from the three Wonders of his Escape 1651. His Restauration 1660. and his Success ever since. Great is our happiness in him, multiplyed it is in Relations, <HI>Uno avulso non deficit alter Aureus:</HI> On his Throne he sits, with a Gracious Queen on his right hand, his Ex∣cellent Mother before him, his Royal Brother on his left hand, his Grave and Honourable Council at his Feet, his Reverend Bishops about his Throne, his Loyal Nobility near his Person, his Unanimous Gentry attending his Pleasure, and that August Council, called a Parliament, made up of all these, as one man, reconciling his Preroga∣tive, and his Peoples Liberties, to the Envy of most Neighbours, and the Amazement of all. Look we into their Debates, they are dutiful: in∣to their Counsells, they are rational, loyal, and resolute; into their Expedients, they are season∣able; into their Supplyes, they are honourable; and into their Unanimity, and, as one man, they are resolved to live and dye with their dear and dread Soveraign.</P>
<PB N="256" REF="141"/>
<P>If we return to the Court, it's full, thrifty, wary, and strict. If to the Exchequer, it's full, with a Revenue, double that of former Kings, 1200000 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> besides the Resolution of the People, to spend their Lives and Fortunes, for the defence and honour of the King, and in him, of the Kingdom, and themselves. If to the Courts of Justice, they are filled with most rever∣end and famous Men. If to the Church, it's full of venerable, learned, and prudent Churchmen. If to the Officers of State, they are honourable and experienced. If to the Cabals, there was never Prince, or Council, since the Constitution of Empires, a safer Preserver of secrets; and yet none, whose secrecy and silence we less may fear; where the chief Prelates cast Reverence, and the chief Nobility, of both Kingdoms, Dignity; and all knowing in Forein Affairs abroad, and Dome∣stique Constitutions at home. If into the Church, Disputations are silenced, Pulpits are modest, Presses are regulated, Learning is encouraged, Debauchery is discountenanced, Faction is sup∣pressed, and Schism is made ridiculous. If into the City, the Lord Mayor, and Major General, are active and vigilant; the Aldermen, and Com∣mon Council, are liberal and free (200000 <HI>l.</HI> at at time) the Companies, Officers, and Vestries, are setled. If into the Country, the Forts, Strong Holds, and Havens, are secure; the Militia is setled, and reduced to excellent Rules, for the ease and service of the Country; the Lords Lieu∣tenants, and their Deputies, are powerful and ho∣nest, made up of the choicest Gentry; the Sheriffs,
<PB REF="141"/>that command the Power of the Country, faithful, and well affected; the Justices of Peace, Men of Estates, Wisdom, Interest, Repute, and known Integrity: who execute Justice, regulate Disorders, discover Plots, di∣sperse Conventicles, promote the honour and security of the Kingdom: and these hold, <HI>some</HI> their Estates, <HI>o∣thers</HI> their Places, and <HI>all</HI> their Honour, of his Majesty; under whom Tillage and Husbandry prospereth, Ma∣nufactures are encouraged, Native Commodities are promoted, all People are employed in the Necessities or Conveniencies of the Kingdom, every man under his own <HI>Vine,</HI> every one under his own <HI>Figtree.</HI> If we look back upon the Pretences, Methods, or Principles, of the former Rebellion, they are cut off by Acts of Par∣liament. If forward, on the Opportunities for a future Disturbance, they are all vacated by Acts of State. If men pretend Religion for Disturbance, <HI>England</HI> know∣eth it's Hypocrisie; If Liberty, our People is too sensi∣ble it is Licentiousness; If Propriety, we have been taught, that the meaning of that is Taxes, Plunder, and Free-quarter; If Conscience, <HI>English</HI> Men have learned to <HI>Obey,</HI> and not <HI>Disobey,</HI> for Conscience sake; If Op∣pression, none to that of Disorder, Universal Liberty, and a standing Army; If Looseness in Manners, every man among us, saith, <HI>It cannot be so bad, as when there is no King in</HI> Israel, <HI>and every man may do what is good in his own Eyes;</HI> If the Errours of a Statesman, we see men aim at the Kings head, through the Statesmens sides: No colour for Disturbance among us; and all reason for Peace, in a Nation, to the Government whereof, the grave, learned, and prudent Persons, of all sides, sub∣mit; wherein no man doth or suffereth, but what he consenteth to <HI>himself.</HI> We hear indeed of War upon the Borders of the Empire, but we have Peace in our Bor∣ders; being walled in first with the Ocean, and that Ocean secured by as strong a Navy, as is this day in <HI>Chri∣stendom.</HI> We read of mutual Challenges of Right be∣tween <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> but we are the People, to
<PB REF="142" MS="y"/>whose Land, none so much as pretendeth Right, save our dread Soveraign. We observe others failing in their Designs upon forein Parts, we <HI>great</HI> in our own Posses∣sions, maintain our own Right to the full, and forbear others; equally famous for our <HI>Justice,</HI> and our <HI>Power.</HI> They talk of Kingdoms like to expire in their dying Princes, when we are secured in a Royal Family, not more a Blessing to us, that it is good, than that it is numerous. If Neighbour States have provoked the World, we pity them, for we are at Peace with it. If other Princes throw away their People with vain and ambitious Attempts, we are onely employed <HI>to</HI> secure our own Borders, <HI>to</HI> promote our own Interests and Honour. Some Republiques have the miserable choice of either an intollerable War, or an unworthy Peace: we give the Law to <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Europe, in utrumque para∣ti,</HI> a prosperous War, or an honourable Peace. We stand to no Nations Courtesie, having made our Friendship, and our Enmity, the most Considerable this day in the World. Our Kingdom is <HI>Populous,</HI> our Ground <HI>Fertile,</HI> our Gentry <HI>Expert,</HI> our Yeomen <HI>Trai∣ned,</HI> our Scholars <HI>Learned,</HI> our Noblemen <HI>Active,</HI> our Magazines <HI>Full,</HI> our Money <HI>Ready,</HI> our Court <HI>Ʋnani∣maus,</HI> our Genius <HI>Warlike;</HI> and, in a word, every Particular amongst us, sensible of the Concerns of the <HI>Whole,</HI> Prayeth for His most Excellent Majesty (the Breath of our Nostrils) that his Counsels may prosper, his just Cause may succeed, his Enemies may be asha∣med, and upon his Head his Crown may Flourish: All that love their King and Country, saying,</P>
