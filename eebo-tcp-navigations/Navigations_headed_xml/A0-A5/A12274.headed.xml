<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat which the onely wise God made f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mans behoofe, euen all the world of nothing, <HI>Genesis</HI> the first, is said to be round by all moderne Writers: it is proued by reason, and the holy Scripture saith it, <HI>Psal.</HI> 98. It was di∣uided in two parts by the same God, the part seene, and the part vnseene: But by faith search the Scriptures, there is the part and vse in this our Christian Nauigation discouered.</P>
<P>The part seene is well defined to bee a Booke, In which wee may see and learns to praise God in his workes. And is said to bee of two parts, Celestiall, and Elementall: In the Celestiall part may be considered the Arts, as Musicke, the harmony of the Spheres: of Soule and Body, for whose health Phisicke is next, in which we consider that Miraculous Medicine of preseruing life, be it Philo∣sopher stone, Salt, Virgin-earth, or other denomination, or Mathe∣maticall, as the knowledge of Points, Lines, Circles, Signes, Con∣stelations, Planets, and their Influence and power ouer bodies Ele∣mentall.</P>
<P>It may be said and that by good reason, I should begin at the Centor of the Earth, &amp; so consider of the things contained there∣in,
<PB N="2" REF="5"/> with the Sea, The face of the Earth and Sea, and the things thereon; The Aire couering the other two, and the Fire inclosing them all, making one round body of these Elementall parts, being as a Centor to the rest, and so p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e vpwards vnto the first m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er, shewing the relation and agreement they haue together, I liuing now nearer the Centor of the Earth (as it is obserued) by many thousand miles. But if I end my worke so high may bee proud (as some are) or dazelled in the Celestiall brightnesse, being mor∣tall, be cast downe with <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</HI></P>
<P>In the name of God therefore, and in his feare, I will begin with the first mouer, which going with great violence, turneth the whole frame of the heauen within it, round in 24. houres, from East to West: Which heauen is said to haue no impression in it, being almost invisible, yet carrying the light and darknesse, making differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of time in daies and nights, according to the difference of Longitude and Latitude of places on Earth.</P>
<P>In it are all the circles and points in the whole fabricke of the world said to be described, their plaines defending and meeting in the Centor of the Earth, or on their other Centors.</P>
<P>The two principall points, are the two poles of the world, the North pole eliuated with vs heere at <HI>London</HI> 51. degrees, 30. or there about; and the South pole is right opposite to it. There∣fore depressed iust as much (vnder the horizon of which I will speake anon.) These <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> points are fixed fast and vnmoueable, betweene which and through the Centor of the Earth, there pas∣seth▪ right line, which is called the Axe-tree of the world on which it turneth.</P>
<P>Now we must consider both this right line, and all other right lines, cords, signes, great circles and paralels, to be diuided into 360. degrees, each degree subdiuided into 60. minutes, each minute into 60. Seconds, each Second in 60. thirds, &amp;c. as the case may re∣quire.</P>
<P>The Herman is a great circle, whose Centor is in the middest of the Earth, and his plaine reacheth not onely to the face of the Earth, diuiding the vpper part from the lower, the day from the nights <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut through the Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the planits and fixed starres, euen to the first mouer. This circle hath two poles, one is called <HI>Zon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="5"/> and is right ouer our head, from the which if a right line passe through the Center of the Earth, touching the concaue super∣ficies of the first Mouer, it pointeth out the other Pole, called Mador. In this Circle we count the Amplitude of the Sunne or Starres; and the Point of the Compasse or Wind. All the Circles called Azimuthes, crosse the Horizon at Rectangles and passe through the Poles thereof: His Parallels are Circle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Altitude, in which are obserued the position of the Planets and fixed Starres aboue the Earth, at all howres of the day or night: Or Circles of Depresion diuiding the length of twilight.</P>
<P>The Equator is a great Circle, deuiding the World into two equall parts, the North part and the South: His parallels sets out the Latitude of places on Earth, and declination in the Heauens. All the Meridians doe crosse the Equator at Rectangles and go through the Poles of the World. On this is counted the Lon∣gitude of places on the Earth or Sea: For euerie 4 of equall time made by the equall motion of the Equator doth make 1 degree. And 7 deg. 30 min. of Longitude, either East or West, doth cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> houre difference in time of day or night, and they that dwell 15, or 30 deg. East haue it 12 or 11 a clocke, when we haue it 10 or 11, and those that dwell so much West of vs, haue it 10 or 11 when it is midnight with vs. These that dwell at the East part of our Horison haue it noone when it is but 6 in the morning with vs, and when it is noone with vs, it is 6 at night with them, but with them in the West part of our Horizon it is 6 in the morning. Our Antipodes haue it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e when it is midnight with vs, and when it is Summer with vs, it is Winter with them.</P>
<P>All other Circles not yet named are likewise supposed to bee in the first Heauen, as in the rest of the inferior Orbes of which we suppose 11 after <HI>Maginus.</HI> And to good purpose: For the Lord of Heauen and Earth hath so layd the Foundations of the Earth that they cannot be moued, <HI>Ps.</HI> 14.2. Though <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/></HI> to bring some good purpose about hath imagined so.</P>

<P>THe Zodiaque is a great broad circle crosing the heauens, like a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>re or girdle, of 12<SUP>d</SUP>. broad at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east; in the midest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereof is a little circle called the ecliptique line, which crosseth the Equator at two opposit points, swar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth from it 23<SUP>d</SUP>. 30. at the least, as I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound by obseruation this present yeare 1627. So the poles of the Ecliptique are distant from the poles of the world 23<SUP>d</SUP>. 30. by reason of his obliquitie: Betweene which poles there passeth a right liue or Axetree on which the second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouer or tenth heauen is carried in his owne motion (contrary to the first) from West to East, and is most slowe, making his re∣uolution in 3434 yeares, and 10. daies.</P>
<P>The third mouer or ninth heauen, hath his two poles in the two po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts of the equator and ecliptique, and his motion is from North to South: making his reuolution in 1717. yeares and 5 daies. But it will be sufficient for our necessary vse here to obserue the moti∣on of the 8. Sphere, wherein are all the Celestiall bodies of the fix∣ed Starres placed: whose motion is from West to East, (some say but one degree in 100. yeare.

<P>It hath appeared manifestly that both by Sea and Land, who so trauaileth 60. miles on a great Circle, altereth a degr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in his Trauaile: which taketh 360. times tho number of the whole cir∣cle, maketh 21600. miles the conpasse of the whole Earthland Sea.

Therefore it seemeth there is something to worke vpon to measure these things by.</P>
<P>Likewise I may say, considering that from the earth to the Moone is 15750. miles, and the ☽ is the lowest Planet. There∣fore the two vppermost elements of Ayre and Fire are both to∣gether 15750 mi. in thicknesse: Againe, because the hill Atlas is said to reach to the midle region of the ayre, that hill (which I take to be Teneriffe) may easily be measured, and so the mea∣sure of all the rest is had.</P>
<P>The motion of the Eclipticke causeth other foure circles to be described, two are described of the motion of the Poles ther∣of, being distant from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es of the world 23. degrees 30. min. making two round circles about them: that next the North pole is called the circle Articke, the other is called the circle Antarticke. The other two are described by the motion of the tow. Tropicall points of the eclipticke, that on the North side of the equanox is called the tropicke of Cancer, the other is cal∣led the tropicke of Capricorne. The Zodiacke is diuided in 12. equall parts, beginning at the one intersection of the same with the equanoctiall circle, and so going round: And these are called the 12. signes of the Zodiacke, for as much as they extend them to the full breadth of the Zodiacke, and are the cause thereof.</P>
<P>There are two other circles also of speciall vse in this Art, one is the Equinoctiall colure, the other is the Solititiall colure: These two are great circles, the first parteth the Equator and Zodiacke euen, so as the North signes are from the South signes parted by the first point of the first signe, and the first point of
<PB N="6" REF="7"/> the sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outh signe: and these signes are called Aries ♈, and Li∣bra ♎, beginning the Spring and Autumne, the other passeth by the two tropicall points of Cancer ♋, and Capricorne ♑, making the beginning of Summer and winter; both passing through the poles of the world, parting the Zodiacke in foure equall parts, and the equator also with all his paralels.</P>
<P>The first point of ♈, beginneth the Spring: that is, when the Sunne in his motion commeth first to that point, and going through three signes ♈, Taurus ♉, Gemini ♊: then comming to the first point of ♋, beginneth the Summer: and passing through other three signes ♋ Leo ♌, Virgo ♍, so commeth to Libra ♎, Scorpio ♏, Sagitarius ♐, to the first point of ♑: be∣ginneth the winter, from thence through ♑, Aquarius ♒, Pisses ♓ making the whole yeares reuolution. And these 12. signes are called Constellations, and there are other Constellations, some North, some South, in which is had a number of Starres bearing names, according to their nature: and these constellati∣ons beare rule ouer diuers Regions, Countries and Cities.</P>
<P>Now we may passe the Orbes of the other superior Planets, &amp; onely note their friendly aspect as we passe by them: And con∣sider the ☽ motion with the ☉ for the Eclipses of vse, for fin∣ding of longitude on earth or Sea.

<P>REason doth teach, and this 36. yeares experience I haue had, that to the gaining of these knowledges, quantitie is to bee considered, either Geometrically or Arithmetically, or most vsual∣ly of both together. Arithmeticke is the Art of numbering, and

But the figures and Ciphers whe∣ther they be abstract or contract, haue a double signification to expresse them, which is called their numeration, Psal. 90. ver. 12. <HI>O Lord, teach vs so to number our daies, that we may apply our hearts vnto wisedome.</HI> Figures do either signifie themselues onely, as 1. is one, 2. is two, &amp;c. or are valued according to their place: Posi∣tion of this kinde is knowne as men read the Hebrew tongue. This Art giueth the numerall solution in all dementions, and hath these kindes: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Diuision; and these all haue a diuers property in their vse, either in working proportion, or otherwise. Another Arithmatique there is (not of numbers) but of parts of number, hauing like species, proper∣ties and passions, and fetch either their beginning from vnity, but with a difference, for as number increaseth in multitude Infinit∣ly: so doe Fractions decreaseth infinitly but most com∣monly, as in this worke, they are compound: for if I take in account of Time, Motion, Measure, Signes, Degrees, Mi∣nut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Seconds, &amp;c.

<P>Geometry giueth a punctuall termination to all dementions, ei∣ther in length, bredth, or thicknesse: which number many times cannot doe; as in diuiding a line by extreame and meane propor∣tion.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of certaine considerations to be remembred, briefly set downe.</HEAD>
<P>AS I conceiue, there are these three things to be considered, without which fayling cannot be performed. The first, is an exact obseruation of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres. The second, is the perfect finding out of the vari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of the Compasse. Lastly, a true reckoning of the Ships way. These all doe helps one another, and should be precisely had. Againe, the Earth and Sea making one round Body, we may consider that to sayle be∣tween 2 places, may be either by a Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, a Rui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, or a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Circle, as ye may perceiue by the artificiall Globe. Therefore if ye can draw some blanke Charts to carrie with you in your voy∣ages, such whose Meridians and Parralels beare such proportion one to the other in ech Latitude, as those in the Globe, you shall doe well.</P>
<P>In the Globe you may perceiue the degrees in the Equator to agree and be equall with the degrees in the Meridian. Now the
<PB N="14" REF="11"/> degrees in the Meridians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> where equal, but the degrees in the Parralels to the Equator are lesse and lesse, so that a degree of Longitude in the 60 deg. of Latitude is but ½ of that degree of Longitude in the Equator, and as the whole signe is to the number of parts in a degree of Longitude at the Equator, so is the fight of the complement of any Latitude to a fourth number (by the rule of proportion of geometricall demostration) which number tels you how many parts of a degree of the Equator serueth a degree of Longitude in that Latitude, but in a plaine Card where the Meridians are all Parralels, there because the de∣grees of Longitude in ech Latitude are equall, you must increase the degrees of the Meridian in ech Latitude in such proportion as is aboue said, which is easie to be done with the Scale on your Ruler.</P>
<P>This to looke on to the eye will be strange, and to such as loue to st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oke to their old errors, in the plaine Card they will thinke it cleane against reason, but let such describe some portion of the world in it, they may compare it with a Globe, and see it beare a true semetry, but in their plaine Card it will appeare monstrous.

<P>THese things afore spoken of, are most vsefull, and now I hold it a good method to examine your Ship whether shee be for your turne or not, in all things well appointed for the Sea, if new, how well built, and strong, and how well fitted in her ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, if old, whether she be able to indure the surging waues of the Sea, to goe another voyage, and likewise for her burthen, proportioned according to the businesse ye vse her for. But if ye wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> build a new Ship in any proportion assigned, ye shall iudge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> better how to haue it done, by learning so much in Arithme∣ticke,
<PB N="17" REF="12"/> as to be able to extract the Square and Rube root, then may you doe after this example next following, or otherwise at your pleasure. Let the proportion be as two to one, and suppose you haue a Ship of 100 tun, in all things so well framed, that thou doest desire to haue one of 200 tun, and like to the other to do this, first take the measures of your first Ship, which suppose to be these, the Keele 44 foot, at the Beame 20 foot, in Houle 9, foot, her Rake afore 13 foot, after 7 foot, here is giuen sixe num∣bers, and the proportion assigned, and seeing the proportion is to be doubled, therfore take ech number &amp; cube it, then double that cube number, and extract the cube root of that number, and you shall find the second Ship must haue in Keele 55½ foot neere, and Beame 25 and about ½, in Houle 11½, Rake afore 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, after almost 9, and her burthen will be 200 tun, or this may be found by that excellent Instrument of the memorable Mast. <HI>Edmund Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r,</HI> lately set forth by him in his life-time, and is called a Sector, his proportionall Ruler and Crosse-staffe is well knowne to bee an excellent Instrument for these purposes following, and also for many other, Take in equall parts of the Sector 44, and fit it ouer in the Cubes at 44, the Sector so resting, take with your Com∣passes the distance ouer in 88 of the Cubes, and apply it to the equall parts, giueth 55½, as before, do so by the rest, and you shall find the like numbers.</P>
<P>But say it be demanded to haue her of any other proportion, namely, as 20 to 15, or 4 to 3, take the measures of the first, an before, and cube them, then say, if 15 giue such a Cube, what Cube shall 20 giue, it will giue a number, whose Cube root in the number sought. But by the Sector take the numbers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp;c. in equall parts, and fit them ouer in 15 of the Cubes, then take the distance ouer in 20 of the same lines, and that applyed to the equall parts, giueth the number sought.</P>
<P>And now being fitted with a Ship for thy purpose and hauing launched, and going downe the Riuer take heed to the set of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tyde, not onely for running fowle of other craft, but least ye bring your selfe on ground on a Lee shore, on a Shelfe, Sand, or Shole, as Barking shelfe, a Shole against Grayes, Blacke shelfe, the Piles below Tilberie, Milton shore, or in a darke night gape

Going out or in any Riuer whatsoeuer, note what marke yee see with the opening of any Point, as Yoke on a Wall, Tree, House, Hill, Wood, Wind-mill, Steeple, Castle, or Towne, and learne to describe the Semetry of it, and note it in a Booke, remembring to sound the depth, and note it likewise, and what grounds for ancoring good or bad, with the swiftnesse and indraft or outlet of the waters, ye may also describe the windings thereof by the Compasse, with the lengths and breadths on a Paper, and be sure to note the magniticall Azimuth, for your variations, be it of the Sonne or Starres, which to be able to do, learne so much in Geo∣metry, as to be able to describe the Spheare in plaine, and to know the vse of the Globes, or at least to vse your plaine Scale, and keep your trauice on your Card, &amp; a Iournall or daies Book, and know both in Riuer and at Sea, thou must make vse of these two Globes, namely, the Scriptures where the good shine like Starres, and Christ Iesus is the true Load-stone.</P>

This discription is common: but I haue described the parralell lines with prickes, the horison and cirkle of depression with blacke, the almacanter with the other parralells are red, the sigments within are to shew the houre lines as that which croseth the equator as it were at r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct An∣gles: that which croseth the horizon: likewise to shew the Azimuth and that which croseth the Ecliptike to shew the Longitude and Latitude in the Heauens, and though there 3. inscribed sigments be somthing hard to doe by Geometricall demonstration, and for so much as they are of singular vse: Therefore when thou wilt finde the true Azimuth, Longitude, or houre on a parralell; Take thy Sector (see chap. 6.) and open it to the distance of the Semidiame∣ter of that parralell in the totall Sine, then take the distance in the Sine giuen, and apply it in the paralell from the centor it sheweth the true place.</P>

<P>I haue shewed already, chap. 7. how the distance from Pa∣ramont hill was found; And as I conceiue, it is easie to finde the distance of places, if you doe but know the vse of my Ta∣ble of sines, tangents and secants, proviso, note that the 3 an∣gles of any right-lined triangle is equall to 2 rectangles or 180 degrees.</P>
<P>For commonly at sea, you must obserue the land, shore, or whatsoever it is you would know the distance from, what angle it maketh with your course; as admit 40 degrees, then reckon your ships way, suppose 1000 fathome, and then ob∣serve againe, let your second angle be 100 degrees, then adde 100 deg: &amp; 40 degr: which subtract from 180 degr: remainder 40 degr: for the third angle; then haue you 3 angles and one side given, by which meanes the other 2 sides are easily had, and consequently the distance.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="20"/>
<P>Now if the young beginner be troubled to finde the sine of an angle, so big as 100 degr: let him note what the Table saith; subtract 90 degr: from 100 degr: the remainder 10 degr: sub∣tract from 90 degr: rests So degr: or subtract 100 degr: from 180 degr: rests 80 degr: whose sine in my table is 985; the o∣ther two angles being 40 degr: and 40 degr: their sines are 643 and 643, and the distance 1000 fathome: Now to fetch the distance from shore say, as 643 the sine of 40 degr: at <HI>c,</HI> found as before, to 1000 fathome, the distance from <HI>a</HI> to <HI>b,</HI> the a places of observation, so 984 the sine of 80 degr: in the les∣ser quadrant, or 100 degr: in the great, (which is all one) to the distance from <HI>a</HI> to <HI>c</HI> 1531 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/61<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fathome. Another example. 996 sine of 84 degr: 50. 985 sine of 80 de. 262 sine of 15 d: 10. Let your first observation be at <HI>b</HI> 80 degr: the second at <HI>d</HI> 84 degr: 50, and by your reckoning the distance 254 fathome; now it is easy by the former rule to find the angle at <HI>c</HI> 15 degr: 10: then say if 262 giue 254, what giues 985, facit <HI>c d</HI> 954 110/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>: And as 262 to 254, so 996 to the distance <HI>b c.</HI> So that it is all one whether the angles be right, or obtuce, or acute, if they be all acute, there is no more to doe but take the sines out of my table as in the figure K, and no more, if one be a rectangle, then the other 2 are acute, but if an angle be obtuce, as in the figure L, the angle at <HI>b</HI> 100 degr: doe by that angle whatsoe∣ver it be, as in the first example; here because the angles at <HI>a</HI> and <HI>c</HI> are equall, therefore the distance from <HI>b</HI> to <HI>c</HI> is 1000 fathome.</P>
<P>But by the second example, it is but 965 77/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, therefore the angle at <HI>d</HI> was not truly taken; for what 965 77/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is in propor∣tion to 1000, so is the angle at <HI>d</HI> to the true angle: which must needs be more then 84 degr: 50, and the angle at <HI>c</HI> lesse then 15 degr: 10 and consequently the side <HI>c d</HI> is more then 954 120/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. And further you may note, if you have observed so well that the angles be truly taken, then have you not reckoned your ships way truly; and so you may see that one of these doth correct the other, as in the end of the 7 chapter.</P>
<P>And you may fetch a distance by Geometricall protraction, as in chap. 4. suppose you would know the distance from <HI>c</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="21"/> and <HI>b</HI> to <HI>f,</HI> in the figure <HI>m,</HI> first having drawne the angle <HI>b e f,</HI> then reckon your ships way from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to <HI>b</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 fathome, and ha∣ving laid downe so much by your scale and compasses, (see pag. 12) you shall obserue to lay the line <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> b</HI> right in the course your ship went, with <HI>b</HI> next your eye, and <HI>e</HI> towards the place of your first observation; then from <HI>b</HI> draw another line to <HI>f,</HI> and that line will intersect with the line <HI>a f</HI> at <HI>f,</HI> and then you may measure the distance; as in this example <HI>b f</HI> is 100 fa∣thom, and <HI>e f</HI> is 140 fathom.</P>
<P>The next thing that will trouble the young beginner, is the propositions in these 8 and 9 chapters, which are most easily performed, because the demonstration is so plaine.</P>
<P>First therfore as in all plain triangles, the sides are in propor∣tion one to another, as the subtences of the angles opposite, or as the sines of the angles opposite to those sides. Example in the inscribed triangle: <HI>A</HI> the angle at <HI>b</HI> is in proportion to the side <HI>c d</HI> or arke <HI>c g d,</HI> as the angle <HI>c</HI> to the side <HI>b d,</HI> or arke <HI>b d e,</HI> and so is the angle <HI>d</HI> to the side <HI>b c,</HI> or arke <HI>b f c.</HI></P>
<P>So note that in all rectangled right-lined triangles, the two containing sides of the rectangle stand perpendicular one up∣on the end of another: Therefore if you put the least side for radius or totall sine, as in the figure <HI>b,</HI> the other side will be the tangent, and the subtending side of the rectangle will be the secant; or if you put the greater side for radius, the least will be the tangent, and the subtence the secant, or you may put the subtence for radius, as in the figure <HI>c</HI> is done.</P>
<P>It is manifest then that any side may be put for the totall sine: First, if you put the subtending side for radius, as in the figure <HI>d,</HI> let <HI>a b</HI> be part of a meridian, and <HI>a c</HI> part of a paralell; then is the angle at <HI>b</HI> the course from the meridian, and the angle at <HI>c</HI> is the course from paralell.</P>
<P>Then if the difference of latitude <HI>a b,</HI> and course, that is the angle at <HI>b</HI> or <HI>c</HI> be given, you may finde the leagues runne, or distance <HI>b c,</HI> as in the first resolution Arithmeticall.</P>
<P>Or if you put the longer side <HI>a b</HI> for radius, then say as the totall sine <HI>a b</HI> to the difference of latitude <HI>a b,</HI> so the secant <HI>b c</HI> of course, <HI>b</HI> from the meridian, to the distance <HI>b c;</HI> if you put
<PB N="31" REF="21"/> the least side for radius, say as the tangent <HI>a b</HI> of course <HI>c</HI> from paralell, to <HI>a b</HI> the difference of latitude, so <HI>b c</HI> the secant of the same course, to <HI>b c</HI> the distance. Let this su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice for the first proposition chap. 8.</P>
<P>But if you demaund the difference of longitude, the latitude and course being given, you may doe it by the first or second example Arithmeticall in this chapter. page 29; or if you put the longer side <HI>b c</HI> for radius, say, as the course <HI>c</HI> to <HI>a b,</HI> so the course <HI>b</HI> to <HI>a c</HI> the longitude: but if you put the side <HI>a b</HI> for radius, say, as the totall sine to the difference of latitude, so the tangent <HI>a c</HI> to the difference of longitude: if the least side be put for radius, say, as the tangent <HI>a b</HI> to the difference of lati∣tude, so the totall sine to the difference of longitude. And this sufficeth for the Geometricall demonstrotion of the third pro∣position, chap. 8.</P>
<P>And now you see how the proportionall numbers doe a∣rise, it is easie to take them out of the Table, and worke them Arithmetically; and what is said of these propositions may be said of all the rest by the very same reason; except the se∣cond proposition chap. 8, and the 11 proposition in this chap∣ter page 27: the first of these is done as in <HI>Earlid</HI> 1.47. or thus Arithmetically.</P>
<P>Let the line <HI>a</HI> be 3 leagues of longitude and the line <HI>b</HI> 4 leagues of latitude, first multiply 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 3, it is 9, and 4 into 4 is 16, which added is 25, the square roote is 5, for 5 times 5 is 25, and this is equall to the line <HI>c,</HI> the shippes way.</P>
<P>The Geometricall demonstration is this, set the line <HI>a</HI> per∣pendicular vpon the line <HI>b,</HI> as in the figure <HI>f,</HI> then draw the line <HI>c,</HI> and it is 5 the shippes way.</P>
<P>There is another way of demonstration, by adding the sides of the squares into one; also if the way and longitude had beene given, to subtract the one out of the other Geome∣trically, the remainder is the difference of latitude: if the way and latitude had beene given, then the side of the remainder is the difference of longitude, <HI>Euclid</HI> 1.47. <HI>theor.</HI> 33. 6.31. <HI>theor.</HI> 21.</P>

<P>I Might here have added many and manifold propositi∣ons, and chiefly those which doe concerne the great cir∣cle distance betweene any two places howsoever scitu∣ate; but I will first see thy kinde acceptance of this: which if you receive thankfully, I shall be ready to shew thee many more to thy great satisfaction, with the Geome∣tricall demonstration, which I have gathered into a booke in Folio.</P>
<P>And now I will finish this worke with the Moones mo∣tion; supposing you are come in sight of your wished port in safety: which I doe heartily wish to all honest Seamen of my Country, that travell the seas to good ends.</P>
<P>And admit you are in a strange coast, you may the better come to finde the time of a full sea, at a spring tide, to bring your good shippe over a barre or shole: so I shall end my worke where Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> began his: then having read this, you may reade his which is hereto joyned; giving you to understand, if you learne well these propositions of mine, they will make even the hardest things in his booke easy for thy understanding.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="23"/>
<P>Let the full sea at your place of being be at a S Moone on the day of conjunction as at <HI>a,</HI> and the Sunne going in 4 degrees, as from <HI>a</HI> to <HI>c,</HI> the Moone removing in the meane time 48 de∣grees from the Sunne, as to <HI>d,</HI> doth make 3 houres 12 mi∣nutes after noone for the time of high water; and in 16 dayes more the Sunne going from <HI>c</HI> to <HI>e,</HI> that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 degrees from <HI>a:</HI> in the meane time the Moone going from <HI>d</HI> to <HI>f,</HI> that is 260 degrees from <HI>a,</HI> which maketh 17 houres 20 minutes, then substract 12 houres 0 minutes from 17 houres 20 minutes, the remainder 5 houres 20 minutes; out of which take 1 houre 20 minutes for the time of the Sunnes motion in 20 dayes, re∣mainder 4 a clocke for the true time of full sea the Moone be∣ing 20 dayes olde; if you perceive not the reason hereof in∣quire futher, and so you may examine the truth hereof.</P>
<P>Therefore to the ignorant and honest Seaman I say, joyne these things in practise with those things thy Master doth teach thee at sea: And to those things you learne at sea by ex∣perience joyne the practise of the things taught in this booke, and you shall be able in short time, through Gods grace, no doubt, to take charge thy selfe to thy great commendations.</P>
<P>To conclude, you may doe most of the things taught in this booke as afore spoken of chapter the 4, with rular and com∣passes; which if you practise and make your selfe able to per∣forme, (wishing to every good man that is willing to follow these rules, that I were at his elbow to make him a more plaine demonstration) he shall be able in a short time, to doe such service, which without those will not be performed in ten times so much time.</P>
<P>And so I pray thee to accept of this my labour, for unto such as are ignorant and honest, that would learne, onely doe I write this booke: And be sure to reade it all before you judge, so shall you see that such a thing there is, then reade it over againe, and you shall see what manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of thing it is, so you may judge of the good will of the Authour, and reade it over the third time to thy singular profit.</P>
