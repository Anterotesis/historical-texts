But whiles others were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nioying the noble courtesies of the Time, my

thoughts entertained themselues with searching into the proofe of that ordinary Trauell, wherewith I saw men comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly affected; which, I must needs confesse, the more I saw, the lesse I liked. Nei∣ther is it in the power of any for∣raine munificence, to make mee thinke ours any where so well<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as at home. Earthly commodities are no part of my thought: I looked (as I ought) at the soule; which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell saw, vses not only to gather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mosse in this rolling, but suffers the best graces it bath, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o molder away insensibly in such vnneces∣sary agitation.

I meddle not with the common iourneyes to the miner all waters of the <HI>Spa;</HI> to which many sicke soules are beholden for a good ex∣cuse: who whiles they pretend the medicinall vse of that spring, can freely quaffe of the puddle of po∣pish superstition; poisoning the better part, in stead of helping the worse. These I leaue to the best Physician, Authoritie; which if it

I deale only with those, that professe to seeke the glory of a perfect bree∣ding, and the perfection of that, which we call Ciuilitie, in Trauell: of which sort I haue (not without indignation) seene too many lose their hopes, and themselues in the way; returning as empty of grace, and other vertues, as full of words, vanitie, mis-dispositions.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is an ouer-rigo∣rous constructi∣on of the workes of God, that in moting our I∣LAND with the Ocean he ment to shut vs vp from other regions; For God himselfe that made the Sea, was the Author of Nauigation, and hath therein taught vs to set vp a wooden bridge, that may reach to the very Antipodes themselues: This were to seeke discontentment in the bounty of God, who hath placed vs apart, for the singularity of our
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
happinesse, not for restraint.</P>
<P>There are two occasions where∣in Trauell may passe, Matter of trafique, and Matter of State. Some commodities GOD hath confined to some countries, vpon others hee hath with a full hand powred those benefits, which hee hath but sprinkled vpon some. His wise prouidence hath made one Countrey the Granary, ano∣ther the Celler, another the Or∣chard, another the Arsenall of their neighbours, yea of the remo∣test parts. The earth is the Lords which he meant not to keepe in his hands, but to giue; and hee which hath giuen no man his faculties and graces for himselfe, nor put light into the Sun, Moone, Stars for their owne vse, hath stored no parcell of earth with a purpose of priuate reseruation. <HI>Salomon</HI> would neuer haue sent his nauie
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
for Apes and Peacockes, but yet held gold and timber for the buil∣ding of Gods house, and his own, worthy of a whole three yeares voyage: The sea and earth are the great Cofers of God; the disco∣ueries of Nauigation are the keyes, which whosoeuer hath receiued, may know that he is freely allow∣ed to vnlocke these chests of na∣ture, without any neede to picke the wards: Wise <HI>Salomons</HI> com∣parison is reciprocall. A ship of Merchants that fetches her wares from farre is the good Hus-wife of the Common-wealth, and if she were so in those blind voyages of antiquity, which neuer saw needle nor card, how much more thrifty must shee needes be in so many helpes both of nature and Art? Either <HI>Indies</HI> may be searched for those treasures, which God hath laid vp in them for their fardistant
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
owners; Onely let our Merchants take heed, least they go so farre, that they leaue God be∣hinde them; that whiles they buy all other things good cheape, they make not an ill match for their soules, least they end their prospe∣rous aduentures in the shipwracke of a good conscience.</P>

<P>And for matter of policy, no∣thing can be more plaine then that our correspondence with other na∣tions cannot possibly be held vp, without intelligence of their estate, of their proceedings; The neglect whereof were no other then to prostrate our selues to the mercie of an hollow friendship, and to stand still, and willingly lie open whiles wee are plaide vpon by the wit of vntrusty neighbourhood. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se eyes and eares of State are necessarie to the well-being of the head; In which number I doe not

It is the Trauell of curiosity wher∣with my quarrell shall bee main∣tained; the inconueniences where∣of my owne Senses haue so suffici∣ently witnessed, that if the wise parents of our Gentry could haue borrowed mine eyes for the time, they wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d euer learne to keepe their sonnes at home, and not wil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully beate themselues with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taffe of their age: vpon them let

<P>Yea let it be my iust complaint in this place, that in the very trans∣plantation of our sonnes to the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er soile of our owne Vniuersi∣ties, and Innes of Court, nothing
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
is more preiudiciall then speede. Perfection is the childe of Time; neither was there euer any thing excellent, that required not meet leisure: but besides, how com∣monly is it seene, that those which had wont to swimme onely with bladders, sinke when they come first to trust their owne armes? These Lap-wings that goe from vnder the wing of their damme with their shell on their heads, run wilde. If Tutors be neuer so care∣full of their early charge, much must be left to their owne disposi∣tion; which if it leade them not to good, not only the hopes of their youth, but the proofe of their age lies bleeding. It is true, that as the French Lawyers say merily of the Normans, which by a speciall pri∣uiledge are reputed of full age at 21. yeeres, whereas the other French stay for their fiue and
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
twentieth, that <HI>Malitia supplet aeta∣tem;</HI> so may I say of the young∣lings of our time, that Precocitie of vnderstanding supplieth age and stature: but as it is commonly seene, that those blossomes which ouer-runne the spring, and will be looking forth vpon a February∣Sunne, are nipped soone after with an Aprill-frost, when they should come to the knitting: so is it no lesse ordinary that these rathe-ripe wits preuent their owne perfecti∣on, and after a vaine wonder of their haste, end either in shame, or obscuritie. And as it thus falles out euen in our Vniuersities (the most absolute and famous Semi∣naries of the world) where the Tutors eye supplies the parents; so must it needs much more, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se free and honourable Innes (as they are called, for their liber∣tie, Colledges for their vse) of our
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
English Gentry, wherein each one is his owne master in respect of his priuate studie and gouernment: where there are many pots boi∣ling, there cannot but bee much scumme. The concourse of a po∣pulous citie affords many brokers of villanie, which liue vpon the spoiles of young hopes, whose ve∣ry acquaintance is destruction. How can these nouices, that are turned loose into the maine, ere they know either coast, or com∣passe, auoid these rockes and shelues, vpon which both their estates and soules are miserably wracked? How commonly doe they learne to roare in stead of pleading, and in stead of knowing the lawes, learne how to conternne them? We see, and rue this mis∣chiefe, and yet I know not how carelesse we are in preuenting it.</P>
<P>How much more desperate
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
must it then needs be to send forth our children into those places which are professedly infectious, whose very goodnesse is either impietie, or superstition? If wee desired to haue sonnes poisoned with mis-be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eefe, what could wee doe otherwise? Or what else doe those parents, which haue bequea∣thed their children to Antichristi∣anisme? Our late iourney into <HI>France</HI> informed me of some ordi∣nary factors of <HI>Rome,</HI> whose trade is the transporting and placing of our popish nouices beyond the seas; one whereof (whose name I noted) hath beene obserued to carry ouer sixe seuerall charges in one ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re. Are wee so foolish to goe their way, whiles wee intend a contrary period? Doe wee send our sonnes to learne to be chaste in the midst of <HI>Sodome?</HI> The world is wide and open; but our ordinary
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
trauell is southward, into the iawes of danger: for so farre hath Satans policie preuailed, that those parts which are only thought worth our viewing, are most contagious; and will not part with either pleasure, or information, without some tang of wickednesse. What can wee pleade for our confidence, but that there is an houshold of righte∣ous <HI>Lot</HI> in the midst of that impure citie; that there are houses in this <HI>lericho,</HI> which haue scarlet threeds shining in their windowes; that in the most corrupted aire of Po∣perie, some well reformed Christi∣ans draw their breath, and sweeten it with their respiration. Blessed bee God, that hath reared vp the towers of his <HI>Sion,</HI> in the midst of <HI>Babylon.</HI> Wee must acknowledge, not without much gratulation to the Gospell of Christ, that in the very hottest climates of opposition,

<P>In a word, it hath beene the old praise of early rising, that it makes a man healthfull, holy, and rich; whereof the first respects the bo∣dy, the second the soule, the third the estate: all fals out contrary in an early trauell. For health: The wise prouidence of God hath so contriued his earth, and vs, that he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h fitted our bodies to our clime, and the natiue sustenance of the place vnto our bodies. The apparant difference of diet (and of drinkes especially) falling into so tender age, must needs cause a iarre in the constitution; which cannot in all likelihood, but send forth distemper into the whole

course of the ensuing life. The streame runnes like the fountaine, and speeds well, if at last, by many changes of soile it can leaue an ill qualitie behinde it: besides that the mis-gouernance of diet, whereto their libertie layes them open in the weaknesse of their pupillage, cannot but bee extremely preiudi∣ciall. In this point let experience be consulted with; her vnpartiall sentence shall easily tell vs, how few young trauellers haue brought home, sound and strong, and (in a word) English bodies. As for ho∣linesse, we lose our labour, if this discourse proue not that it hath none so great enemie as timely tra∣uell; at once doe wee hazard to abandon God and our home: set an empty pitcher to the fire, it crackes presently, whereas the full will abide boiling. It was the youn∣ger sonne in the Gospell, who

therefore turnes vnthrift, because he got his portion too soone into his hands, and wandred into a farre countrey. The eye of the parent, and the ferule of the master, is all too little to bring our sonnes to good. Where then there is neither restraint of euill, nor helps to grace, how should their condition bee o∣ther than hopelesse? The soile doth much in many plants: the Persian <HI>Hyos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yamus</HI> if it be transla∣ted to <HI>Egypt,</HI> proues deadly; if to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> safe and wholesome: neither is it otherwise with some dispositions, which may iustly curse the place, as accessory to their vndoing. Lastly, for riches, not of the purse, (which is not here thought of) but of the mind, what can bee expected from that age, which is not capable of obseruati∣on, carele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of reposition? where∣of the one gets, the other keepes

It is the malice of an aduersary that mis-reports them; they doe not hold that ima∣ges should bee adored; that the
<PB N="64" REF="40"/>
wood of the crosse should be wor∣shipped with the very same deuo∣tion that is due to Christ himselfe; that the Church is the Iudge of Gods writings; that <HI>Panl</HI> the fift cannot erre; that a man may merit of his maker, much lesse superero∣gate; that a mouse may runne away with that which either is, or was God Almighty; That it is lawfull to kill an hereticall King, and all o∣ther those monsters of opinion, which their most classicke Authors haue both hatched and shamelesly thrust into the light of the world. They defie those ridiculous Le∣gends which we father vpon their Church; and how much doe they scorne S. <HI>Francis</HI> his Bird, or his Wolfe, or his Wounds, or his A∣postles of Assise.

It is not possible that any wise stran∣ger should be in loue with the face of their Church, if he might see her in her owne likenesse, and therfore they haue cunningly masked one part of it, and painted another, so as those features of hers which are vgly and offensiue, shall not ap∣peare to any but her owne eyes.

Pastor; the sicke mans wife sends for a Iesuite; both meet at the beds side; each perswades him to his owne part; both pleade for their religion at this barre, before these Iudges: after two houres dis∣putation, not only the Gentleman was cheerefully confirmed in that iudgement which hee had embra∣ced, but his wife also, out of the euidence of truth, began to incline to him, and it: The Iesuite depar∣ted discontent; yet within some few houres after, returning (when the coast was clearer) intreats some priuate conference with the Gen∣tlewoman; with whom walking in her garden, hee did vehemently expostulate, mixing therewithall his strongest perswa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons; at last to shut vp his discourse, he impor∣tun'd her with many obsecrations, that she would vou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hsafe to re∣ceiue from his hands a little boxe

<P>And if at any time these vnwor∣thy papers may fall betwixt the hands of my Soueraigne Master, or any of his graue and honorable ministers of State, let the meane∣nesse of so weake and obscure soli∣citors presume to commend this matter to their deepest consideration;

and out of an honest zeale of the common safetie, sue to them for a more strict restraint of that dangerous libertie, whereof too many are bold to carue them∣selues. Who can bee ignorant of those wise and wholesome lawes, which are enacted already to this purpose? or of those carefull and iust cautions, wherewith the licen∣ces of Trauell are euer limited? But what are wee the better for Gods owne lawes, without execu∣tion? Or what are limits vnto the lawlesse? Good lawes are the hedges of the Common-wealth: iust dispensations are as gates, or stiles in the hedge. If euery stragler may at pleasure cast open a gap in this fence of the State, what are we the better for this quickset, then if wee lay open to the common? Who sees not how familiarly our young Recusants, immediately
<PB N="93" REF="55"/>
vpon their disclosing, are sent ouer for their full hatching and ma∣king? <HI>Italie, Spaine, Artois,</HI> and now of late <HI>France</HI> it selfe, prouides nests, and perches, and mewes for these birds, with the same confi∣dence, wherewith wee breede our owne at home; which, when they are once well acquainted with the Roman lure, are sent backe againe, fit for the prey. And as for those of our owne feather: whereas the libertie of their Trauell is bounded chiefly with this double charge; one, that they haue no conuersa∣tion or conference with Iesuites, or other dangerous persons; the other, that they passe not into the dominions of the Kings enemies; both these are so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommonly neg∣lected, as if they were intended only for a verball formalitie, yea as if the prohibition meant to teach men what they should doe.

Euery of our nouices hath learned to make no difference of men; and dare breathe in the poisonous aire of <HI>Italie</HI> it selfe, and touch the very pommell of the chaire of pesti∣lence. It is this licentious freedome (which wee mis-call open-hearted ingenuitie) that vndoes vs. Doe wee not see the wary closenesse of our Aduersaries, which will not so much as abide one of our books (a mute solicitor) to harbour in any of their coasts? How many of the Italian or Spanish Noblesse haue wee knowne allowed to ven∣ture their education in our Courts or Vniuersities? Doe they lie thus at the locke, and doe wee open our breast, and display our armes, and bid an enemie strike vs where hee list? Since then wee haue no more wit, or care, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bee willingly guiltie of our owne shame, oh that the hands of supreme authoritie
<PB N="95" REF="56"/>
would be pleased to locke vs with∣in our owne doores, and to keepe the keyes at their owne girdle. And (to speake truth) to what purpose are those strait and capitall inhibi∣tions of the returne of our factious fugitiues into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Kingdome, if whiles the wicket is shut vpon them, that they should not come to vs, the posterne be open to vs, that we may goe to them? As all intercourse is perillous, so that is most, which is by our owne pro∣uocation. Here yet they dare but lurke in secret, and take only some sudden snatches at a weake prey, like vnto euening-wolues, that ne∣uer walke forth but vnder the cloake of the night; but in their owne territories, they can shew the sunne their spoiles, and thinke this act worthy of garlands and trophees. Here we haue mastiues to secure our flockes: there the
<PB N="96" REF="57"/>
prey goes stragling alone to the mouth of their dennes, without protection, without assistance, and offers to be deuoured. Ye whom the choice of God hath made the great Shepheards of his people, whose charge it is to feed them by gouernment, suffer not their sim∣plicitie to betray their liues vnto the fangs of these cruell beasts; but chase them home rather, from the wilfull search of their owne perdi∣tion, and shut them vp together in your strong and spacious folds, that they may be at once safe, and yee glorious.</P>

<P>Lastly, for those, whom ne∣cessary occasions draw forth of their owne coasts (that wee may haue done with those, which like foolish Papists goe on pilgrimage to see another blocke better dres∣sed then that at home) let mee say to them, as <HI>Simeon</HI> that propheticall
<PB N="97" REF="57"/>
Monke said to the pillers which hee whipped before the Earth-quake, Stand fast, for yee shall be shaken. And therefore, as the Crane, when shee is to flie against an high winde, doth ballace her selfe with stones in her bill, that shee may cut the aire with more steddinesse; so let them carefully fore-instruct, and poise themselues with the sound know∣ledge of the principles of religion, that they may not bee carried about with euery winde of do∣ctrine. Whereto if they adde but those lessons, which they are taught by the State, in their letters of passage, there may be hope, they shall bring backe the same soules they carried. It was at least an in∣clination to a fall, that <HI>Eue</HI> tooke boldnesse to hold chat with the Serpent. And as subtill Lawyers desire no more aduantage in the
<PB N="98" REF="58"/>
quarrell, which they would picke at conueyances, then many words, so neither doe our Aduersaries. Whiles our eares are open, and our tongues free, they will hope well of our very denials. Errour is cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tie, and out of the power of his Rhetoricall insinuations, oft∣times carries away probabilitie from truth. I remember in that fa∣mous Embassie of the three Philo∣sophers, which <HI>Athens</HI> sent to <HI>Rome, Critolaus, Diogenes,</HI> and <HI>Car∣neades,</HI> there falling out many oc∣casions of discourse, wise <HI>Cato</HI> per∣swaded the Senate to a speedie dis∣mission of those (otherwise wel∣come) guests; because (said hee) whiles <HI>Carneades</HI> disputes, scarce any man can di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cerne which is the truth. There is more danger of these spirituall Sophisters, by how much the businesse is more impor∣tant, and their subtiltie greater. Let
<PB N="99" REF="58"/>
our passenger therefore (as that wise Grecian serued his fellowes) stop vp his eares with waxe against these Syrens. Our Sauiour would not giue Satan audience euen whiles hee spake true; because hee knew that truth was but to coun∣tenance errour. There is euer true corne strowed vnder a pit-fall: those cares are full and weightie, which wee dresse with lime to de∣ceiue the poore birds in a snow. No fisher lets downe an emptie hooke, but clothed with a proper and pleasing bait. These impostors haue no other errand, but deceit. If he loue himselfe, let him bee afraid of their fauours, and thinke their frownes safer then their smiles. And if at any time (as no flie is more importunate) they thrust themselues into his conuer∣sation, let him (as those which must necessarily passe by a carrion
<PB N="100" REF="59"/>
in the way) hold his breath, and hasten to be out of their aire. And if they yet follow him in his flight, let him turne backe to them with the Angels farewell, <HI>Increpet te Dominus.</HI></P>
