</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the wauering and interchaungeable course, whereto euery thing whatsoeuer is continually subiect, hath beene alwayes heretofore dayly obserued, in the most auncient, and renowmed Monarchies that euer were. So hath it appea∣red in these latter dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kingdomes and states ful of change and mutabilitie in this age.</NOTE> and that in a more liue∣ly maner, in the strange and wonderfull altera∣tions of our neighbor countryes: whose peace and prosperous estate, as it was the common ob∣iect of euerie mans eye: so are their vnfortunate warres, and wofull miseries, the vsuall subiect of all mens speach, and nothing is more lystened after, then to what ende matters of so great waight and importance are likeliest to tend. The most noble and renowmed kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> which for so many yeares flowed with milke and honie, and for the temperatenesse of the aire, the fertilitie of the soile, the ciuilitie of the Commons, the loyaltie of the Nobilitie, the dignitie and magnificence of the Prince, was accounted the paragon of all Nations, hath especially tasted of this vicissitude, and change: which so long as it was at peace with it selfe, and not afflicted with any ciuill discention, the subiect honouring the King with all dutifull obedience, and the King tendering the welfare of the subiect with a hearty and louing affection, and both concurring in one for
<PB N="2" REF="4"/> the aduauncement of the Common-wealth, flourished in most beautifull maner, and appeared verie pleasing to the eye of all Nations round about: but after that it once began to nourish turbulent spirits, and to harbour strange and vnnaturall humours, the Prince following the daungerous proiects of yong and corrupt councellors, who rather sought their owne priuate gaine, then the publike profite and vtilitie of the state, and the people beeing easily drawne by the perswasions of their Gouernours to embrace in a maner any noueltie that was propounded: then began the common-wealth to bee intangled in manie daungerous mischiefes, and to bee encombred with sundrie cares, wherewith for this long time it hath beene exceedingly vexed, and tormented. And albeit there hath often bin some mitigation of paine for a while: and that by the great wisedome and skill of such as sate at the stearne, and had the managing of the publike affayres, the ship, which was well neare ouerwhelmed with boisterous waues, was safely preserued from the wracke: yet, as though there were a fatall destinie, which could not be auoided, it presently againe fell vpon the shelues, and plunged it selfe a fresh into a vast Ocean of vnspeakeable miseries, wherein it hath continued floting vp and downe for these many yeares, and at this day is come to that desperate passe, that although it be neither split vpon the sandes, nor swallowed vp of the fearefull billowes, yet doth it serue as a perfect glasse, to viewe the vnstable estate of these earthly things: and for an assured proofe of the variable change, and continuall vicissitude in the most flowring kingdoms and common-wealthes. Which albeit it doth euidently appeare vnto the eye of euery beholder, yet will it be farre better discerned, if wee consider the reignes of sundry French Kings, in whose times there hath fallen out most strange and admirable accidents, themselues being especiall occasions to prooue a mutuall and an alternatiue course, in al things whatsoeuer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lewis the <HI>11.</HI> K. of France, rebelled in his youth against his father</NOTE><HI>Lewis</HI> the eleuenth of that name, King of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and sonne vnto <HI>Charles</HI> the seuenth, was in his youth (as <HI>Philip de Comins</HI> reporteth) allured by the craftie perswasions of sundrie seditious heades, to become chiefe of a rebelli∣ous faction, and to beare Armes agaynst his father, to his vnspeakeable griefe, and the imminent perill of the whole lande: <MILESTONE N="1461"/> but that vnnaturall warre not continuing long, and the sonne being drawne to his obedience, by the louing and wise perswasions of the King his father, all things grewe verie peaceable for a time, and the yong Prince continued in verie good grace, vn∣till at length by reason of newe occasions of suspition, hee was forced to a∣uoyde the Realme, so exceedingly was the King his father incensed agaynst him: and going to <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundie,</HI> who at that present was a verie great and mightie potentate, was most honorably intertained, &amp; furnished with all things necessarie for himselfe and his retinue: where hee remained for a long time, notwithstanding, the duke was very often &amp; earnestly solicited to the cō∣trarie by the king his father.

<P>The King vnderstanding the daunger wherein the towne stoode,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. mar∣cheth toward Paris.</NOTE> and the resolution of his enemies, hasted by all possible meanes to put himselfe with∣in <HI>Paris,</HI> the safekeeping whereof woulde be most auayleable for the aduance∣ment of his other affayres. Wherefore hauing gathered a strong power, marched forwardes on his intended voyage, not purposing to hazarde his fortune vppon anie aduauntage that shoulde be offered, but onelie to de∣fende himselfe, and to amuse his enemies, vntill the tyme might minister some better meanes to accomplish his desyres: notwithstanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The k forced to forsake the field.</NOTE> through the rash headinesse of the Lieutenant of <HI>Normandie</HI> called <HI>Le Bressy,</HI> who had the leading of the auauntgarde, the King was constrained to fight, and to aduenture to open his passage by force of armes. But being valiantly resisted by his enemies, after a terrible and bloodie fight, hee was forced to forsake the field, and to retyre towards <HI>Corbeile,</HI> leauing the entyre glorie of that victorie, to Count <HI>Charolois,</HI> and his associates.</P>
<P>As this good fortune puffed vp the haughtie minde of the Conquerour, making him proude, disdainfull, and highly conceyted of his owne va∣lour, which in the ende bred his owne confusion and ouerthrowe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣concileth his subiects, and maketh peace with Count Charolois.</NOTE> so did it teach the conquered to pull downe his spirits, and with all circumspect di∣ligence and care, to prouide for his future safetie, in the most politike man∣ner that hee might: and hauing (though with much adoo) made peace with Count <HI>Charolois,</HI> an enemie that hee greatly feared, and reconciled his dis∣contented Nobles, who were a long time as prickes in his eyes, and thornes in his sydes, and withall concluded a league with <HI>Edwarde</HI> the fourth King of <HI>Englande,</HI> at <HI>Pikquennie,</HI> to his great aduauntage, there remayned nothing that might any way endaunger his estate, but onelie the greatnesse of <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundie,</HI> who though he were at amitie with the King, yet for that hee had a most turbulent spirite, and of all other could least abide to conti∣nue for anie long time together in peace, the King thought hee had iust oc∣casion to suspect him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charles D. of Burgundy slaine at Nancy.</NOTE> and therefore howsoeuer in outwarde shewe he made much of him, yet in heart hee wished for nothing more then his confusion and ouerthrowe: which appeared most apparantly by his secrete practises a∣gaynst the Duke, and then coulde no longer be hidde, when as hee heard of his discomfiture at the battaile of <HI>Nancy,</HI> where the sayde Duke was slaine,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/> his armie put to flight, and the glorie of that noble house of <HI>Burgundie,</HI> which had flourished for the space of an hundred and twentie yeares, in all pompe and magnificence, was vtterly defaced and obscured. For presently vppon the newes, the King was so exceeding ioyfull, that hee did not in a maner regarde how richly and bountifully he rewarded the Messengers of so glad and ioyfull tydings. Nowe beganne hee to studie for nothing so much as howe to dis∣member this poore afflicted Dukedome, and by all meanes possible to teare and rent it in peeces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">K.

<P>But hee had no sooner attayned to so high a degree of happinesse, but hee was presently crossed with newe miseryes and afflictions, which in small continuance of tyme did wholie bereaue him of his former ioyes. For bee∣ing at dinner at a Village neare vnto <HI>Chynon,</HI> hee was suddainlie stroken with so vehement a payne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King stroken with a sudden disease.</NOTE> that hee lost his speach and sences, for the space of two dayes togither, not remembring nor knowing any that were nearest about him.

Besides, hee grewe so suspitious of all sortes, and so iealous of his owne sonne, and sonne in Lawe, that hee was neuer at quyet, but lyued in such continuall feare, least that honour and reuerence which had beene for so long a tyme giuen vnto him, shoulde now be anie wayes diminished, or his former au∣thoritie impayred, that for the maintenaunce thereof hee vexed himselfe in most straunge and pittifull sort.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lbeit that <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleuenth not long before his death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charles the eight succee∣ded his fa∣ther Lewis in the king∣dome of France.</NOTE> had of∣tentimes, and that very seriously, aduised his sonne <HI>Charles,</HI> who was to succeed him in the kingdome, to maintain peace and amitie with all his neighbours rounde about, and by no meanes to enter into warres with any forraigne Princes, before hee were growne to ripe yeeres, and that the Realme which had endured so many calamities and miseries, where∣with it was greatly impouerished, should be growne rich againe, and better prouided to resist any violence that should be offered: yet could not the graue and strong perswasions of so wise and well experienced a Prince, take such deepe rooting in the heart of this yong King, but that thorow his owne am∣bitious desire to make himselfe great, and the manifolde reasons alleaged by sundrie of his aduisants, partly to flatter him in his owne honour, but more especially to serue theyr owne turne, they were quickly plucked vppe againe, and hee fully resolued to enter into a warre, which of all other was thought most daungerous, and which wrought as straunge effectes, as much varie∣tie, and as singular alterations and chaunges, as any other whatsoeuer. All which to the ende they may bee the better vnderstood, it shall bee verie conuenient to rippe vp the matter from the beginning, and in as fewe words as may bee, to shewe the originall of so great trouble, as afterwardes en∣sued.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the eight King of <HI>Fraunce</HI> pretending a title to the Kingdome of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> as heire to <HI>Reynard</HI> Duke of <HI>Aniow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lewis Sfor∣tia <HI>D.</HI> of Millan, per∣swadeth Charles the eight to conquere Naples.</NOTE> was no sooner settled in his king∣dome, but he was forthwith enduced by the colourable perswasions of <HI>Lewis Sfortia,</HI> who had not long before vsurped the Dukedome of <HI>Millan,</HI> to put in his claime, and with might and mayne to assay to gette so noble, so rich and renowmed a Diademe. Notwithstanding, for that it was a mat∣ter of no small importaunce, it was thought good to haue it thorowly de∣bated in Councell, and to heare the opinions of the wisest and the best
<PB N="6" REF="6"/> experienced in the lande, who when they had with great maturitie of iudge∣ment pondered euerie circumstance: as the danger the king was likely to thrust himselfe into, the infinite treasure that must bee expended: as also what a multi∣tude of valiant mens liues that would cost, before so glorious a victorie could be atchiued, and the difficultie that would be in keeping that beeing once got∣ten:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Councel dis∣swadeth the King from the conquest of Naples.</NOTE> they wholly resolued that it was an enterprise in no wise to be attempted. Notwithstanding, the king who was yong, &amp; desirous to eternise his name by some memorable attempt, could in no wise be diuerted, being moued as it were by some diuine instinct, and incouraged by sundrie remonstrances of two of his principall fauorites, called <HI>Vere</HI> and <HI>Brissonet,</HI> both which were but meane poli∣ticks, and of all other most ignorant in militarie affaires. These two were daily solliciters of the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vere and Brissonet en∣cite the king to enter Italy</NOTE> who otherwise was but too willing of himselfe, to pro∣uide all necessaries for his intended voyage, and to set forwarde with as much celeritie as possibly might be.</P>
<P>The yonger sort of the French Nobilitie, and such as had least experience, were likewise exceeding desirous to enter <HI>Italy</HI> by force of Armes, and to shew their valour and noble courage to forraigne Nations. Al things seemed to con∣curre for the furtherance of this happy attempt, saue that which was most ne∣cessarie and that was, wise and wel experienced Captaines, and store of siluer and gold, which are accounted as the veines and sinewes of the warres. There were men enough, but such as were most fitte were most vnwilling: the Kings Coffers were emptie, and nothing could bee borrowed but vpon great interest and good assurance. Thus the lets were many, and the meanes to effect any thing with honour, very small: and in the end, if the successe were such as was desired, yet should there be nothing gotten, (as <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleuenth was wont to say) but infinite trouble and imminent perill, and that with the effusion of much French bloud.</P>

<P>The yong King <HI>Ferdinando</HI> made great preparation to withstand the French, and hauing gathered a strong power, encamped at Saint <HI>Germin,</HI> in the frontiers of his territories, resoluing to stop the passage of the enemie at that place.

<PB N="8" REF="7"/> For assoone as he vnderstood by his espyals, that the French were within two leagues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferdinando K. of Na∣ples, flieth from the French.</NOTE> he fled in very disordered manner towards <HI>Capua,</HI> suffering the French King to enter at his pleasure, and from thence hasted to <HI>Naples,</HI> fearing a reuolt among the Citizens, which indeede immediatly ensued vppon the approch of the French: who comming to <HI>Capua,</HI> entred presently vppon composition, and before they came at <HI>Naples</HI> by three leagues, the Citizens sent Embassadors to treat with them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naples yeel∣deth to the French king.</NOTE> being willing to receiue thē vpon condition, that they should maintaine their ancient priuiledges which so terrified <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> that he pre∣sently tooke sea, and fled to his father in <HI>Cicilia.</HI> Then was there a generall re∣uolt, and euerie one made court to the French king, who was receiued with great acclamation and applause of the people: yea, those who were in particu∣lar most bounden vnto the house of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and such as had beene their espe∣ciall fauourites, were now in an instant wholly turned French.

<P>The French King beeing entred into <HI>Naples,</HI> disposed of all things at his pleasure, and seemed nowe to haue attained to his wished ende: there was no∣thing to crosse him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charles of France crowned king of Naples.</NOTE> or to stand in his way, but like a conquerour hee comman∣ded and it was obeyed: wherupon he would needs be crowned King. Which being perfourmed, and the French not standing any longer in feare of any ene∣mie, they beganne to bee idle and carelesse, and gaue themselues wholly to riot and excesse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pride of the French.</NOTE> They seemed to contemne all others, and scorned the Italians as men of no reckoning, supposing that now they were able to passe through the whole world, and that no man durst abide them.

<P>When as the King of <HI>France</HI> was growen to this greatnesse, that hee had in a manner all the estate of <HI>Italy</HI> at his commaund: that hee had gotten the King∣dome of <HI>Naples,</HI> and was quietly possessed thereof, and thereby was climed to the top of fortunes wheele, so that it seemed that nothing was wanting, to the full accomplishment of all his desired happinesse: when as indeed he was most secure and carelesse, and supposed that hee stood without the reach of any mis∣fortune:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundry great princes con∣spire against the French.</NOTE> presently the wheele began to turne about, and sundry secret practi∣ses were set abroch, to cut short the French proceedings: &amp; in the end a league was concluded, which darkened the faire shining of the <HI>Flower delis,</HI> to proue the variable and vncertaine estate of all things whatsoeuer.</P>
<P>Although <HI>Alphonsus</HI> were driuen out of <HI>Italy,</HI> yet did hee continually fight against the French, by procuring as many enemies against him as possibly hee might: hee daily layde before the eyes of other Princes, howe perilous a matter it would bee for them to suffer the King of <HI>France</HI> to grow so great, and sought especially to stirre the Venetians against him. The Turke on the o∣ther side threatened them at the request of the Pope, if they would not declare
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> themselues open enemies vnto him. The King of <HI>Spaine</HI> began to feare the losse of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> and <HI>Cicilia,</HI> and the Emperor grew iealous of his Empyre.

<P><MILESTONE N="1495"/> The King being as desirous now to get to <HI>Paris,</HI> as hee was before to conquer <HI>Naples,</HI> marched toward <HI>Rome</HI> with some nine hundred men at armes, and eight or nine thousand footmen, Switzers, Almaines, and French.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope flieth from Rome.</NOTE> But the Pope hea∣ring of his comming fled to <HI>Padoua,</HI> so that he entred without any resistance: but he staid not long there, for intending to make al the hast that might be, he remo∣ued to <HI>Sennei,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Pisa,</HI> still passing forward, though verie slow∣ly, by reason of the euil waies. By this time had the Venetians gathered a strong power, wherwith they ment to stop his passage. And hauing appointed <HI>Francis Gonzaga</HI> Marques of <HI>Mantoua,</HI> for their generall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mar∣ques of Man¦toua, generall of the Vene∣tian forces.</NOTE> with whom they ioyned two Venetian Lieutenants, or <HI>Prouiditori, Melchior Creuisano,</HI> and <HI>Luke Pisano,</HI> com∣maunded them to put themselues betweene home and the French, and if it were possible to stay the King, and force him to pay the Almendate for the harme he had done to the Italian Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Gonzaga</HI> being a lusty yong Gentleman, &amp; desirous to win renowme, by some memorable act, hauing intelligence by his espials, that the French marched to∣ward <HI>Foro Nouo,</HI> sent his light horsemen before vnder the conduct of <HI>Nicholas Annonio,</HI> a Sclauonian, to stay the enemie with light skirmishes, vntill he might ouertake them with the strength of his armie: who readily accomplishing the commandement of the generall, hasted forward with great speed, &amp; taking the French auantgard at aduantage, slue many of them, and forced the rest to retire to their strength. The king ouertaking his vantgard, encamped at <HI>Foro Nouo,</HI> hard by the riuer of <HI>Terro.</HI> The marques was encamped on the other side, right in the way that the French men should passe: so that the King seeing there was no remedie, but that he must needes fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battell of Terro.</NOTE> and open the way by the dint of the sword, disposed of his army in as warlike maner as he could, and resolued as that day to try the vttermost of his fortune. And being mounted vpon a braue and lusty courser enuironed with 7. yong gētlemen of approued fidelity &amp; prowes, armed in all points like vnto himself, rode about his ranks to encourage his sol∣diers, who with their cheerful countenances seemed to assure him of the victo∣rie, and with the hazard of their owne liues, to defend him from the violence of his enemies. The Bastard of <HI>Burbon</HI> in whom he reposed a speciall trust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of the French armie.</NOTE> with <HI>Robinet Framesell,</HI> the valiaunt conductour of the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> his men at Armes, enuironed him with their companyes of horsemen on both sydes. The Rerewarde was ledde by <HI>Foix,</HI> a Noble man of <HI>Guien,</HI> and <HI>Segnieur de Trimouille,</HI> and with them was there a great troupe of men at Armes.
<PB N="10" REF="8"/> the Switzers and Almaines, in whom consisted the strength of the battaile, gar∣ded the Ordinance, which being drawne with equall pace close to the battail∣lon of the footmen, was placed right in the front of the enemie. The Mareschall <HI>Guy,</HI> and <HI>Tribulzi</HI> a man of great fame and experience in the warres, marched be∣fore with certaine light horsemen, to lead the way to them which followed.</P>
<P>The Marques seeing the French come downe from <HI>Foro Nouo,</HI> in aray of battaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of the Venetian armie.</NOTE> quickly arraunged his men, and diuiding them into nine battaillons, as well for the mutuall succour each of other, as thereby to assaile the French on all sides, and intended to abide the comming of his enemies. In the first bat∣taile was <HI>Petro Dodo,</HI> a Venetian, with sixe hundred Greeke horsemen, and al∣most as many Archers on horsebacke, who were appointed to compasse the hils, and to assaile the enemie on the backe. The second battaile was led by the earle <HI>Giazza,</HI> consisting of sixe hundred men of Armes, and three thousand Almaine and Italian footemen. The Generall himselfe with his Vncle <HI>Radulph</HI> and <HI>Ranucio Farnesi,</HI> with fiue hundred men of Armes, and as many Archers, with foure thousand footemen, tooke vpon him to encounter with the middle bat∣taile, wherein was the Kings owne person. The fourth battaile was assigned to <HI>Fortebraccio de Montoni,</HI> who was commaunded to charge the Rerewarde. Three other battailes were appoynted to <HI>Anthonie de Feltri, Annibal Bentiuoli,</HI> and <HI>Galeazzo Palauicini,</HI> which should serue to ayde and succour where there was most need. The eight and ninth battaile were likewise prouided against all vncertaine chances which might ensue.</P>
<P>Each armie being thus readie raunged, awayted the signall of the battaile: which was no sooner giuen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hardie encounter of both armies.</NOTE> but they ranne togither with great furie, the trum∣pets sounded, the drummes stroke vp, the great Ordinance thundered from either side, and all sorts fought verie couragiously. But the <HI>Estradiots,</HI> who had beene repelled by the French men of armes, espying the Kings baggage (which by counsaile of <HI>Triuoltio</HI> had beene obiected to the enemie, to the ende that hee beeing busie about the spoyle, a more readie and easie passage might bee opened for the King) flung out of their rankes, and fell to ryfling in most greedie manner. Which thing (in the opinion of all men) turned to the great good of the French: who otherwise had beene in maruaylous danger to haue beene ouerthrowne at that encounter. The Marques fought valiauntly, and pearcing through the middest of the horsemen hard to the Ordinance, ouer∣threw a great bande of Gascons, which were appointed to guard them. The French being encouraged with the presence of their king, laide about them like men, and the Switzers beeing promised double pay, like Tygres, tare and rent in peeces as manie as fell into theyr handes. And had not the earle of <HI>Petilia</HI> at that present escaped from the French, and by comming to the flying Italians, with all the forceable reasons hee coulde, perswaded them to renew the fight, the whole power of the Venetians had beene vtterly ouerthrowne. Both armyes being well wearied with a long and bloody fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French K. looseth all his baggage.</NOTE> they sounded the retreate. The French had lost all their baggage, and the riches of <HI>Naples,</HI> which was going into Fraunce, was taken by the Italian souldiours: a great number of their brauest men were slaine, and amongst others the bastarde of <HI>Burbon,</HI> a man of surpassing great valour. The King himselfe hauing likewise lost
<PB N="11" REF="8"/> all his plate and houshold stuffe, was in extreme peril, and had vndoubtedly bin taken, had it not beene for the excellencie of his horse, which was a cole black, with one eye. And although he gate the victorie, and remained maister of the field, yet were his losses verie great, and farre surmounted the gaine he had got∣ten in that long and wearie voyage. He was constrained to lie the night follow∣ing in a simple cottage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The distresse of the French King.</NOTE> and all his great Lords were lodged round about him in the open fields, who had nothing to eate, nor any chaunge of apparell to put on: So that they resolued to dislodge in the dead of the night, and with al speed to recouer <HI>Ast.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French run out of Italie.</NOTE> The Armie was sore afrighted and euery man coueted to bee in the Vauntgard, supposing thereby to be furthest from daunger, and nearest vn∣to places of safest retreate.

<P><MILESTONE N="1496"/> The king was no sooner in <HI>France,</HI> but all things went backewarde in <HI>Italie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great alteration in Italie.</NOTE> all places reuolted, and well was he that could first teare in peeces the <HI>Flower de Lis.</HI> Whosoeuer had beene friends before, now became enemies, and nothing was so hastily gayned, but it was as speedily lost.

The King was no sooner certified hereof, but that sen∣ding for all his Captaines and men of war, he fully determined to continue his siege, and to expect the comming of his enemie, whatsoeuer coulde bee alleaged to the contrarie, often affirming that hee hadde rather dye then to stirre one foote before he had taken the Citie.</P>
<P>The emperiall Captaines beeing driuen into great necessitie for want of money and other necessaries, and hauing much adoo to pacifie theyr soul∣diours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe∣rials enuade the french Kings camp.</NOTE> thought it best to vse expedition, considering that it was impos∣sible for them to continue long, their men growing mutinous for want of pay: and thereuppon as those that stoode in very desperate estate, hasted to inuade the French, who prepared with great courage to meete them: they were exceedingly encouraged by the presence of theyr King, who should bee an eye witnesse of theyr valour and prowesse. The marquesse of <HI>Pescara</HI> with three thousande Spanish footemen assayled the French tren∣ches, where hee slew fiue hundreth men, and poysoned three peeces of great ordinance.</P>
<P>This vnexpected accident dismaied many of the French souldiers, and the rather, for that the Admirall, who carryed the cheefe sway in the Ar∣my next vnto the king, was hurt in the thigh with a shotte, and was car∣ried to <HI>Placentia</HI> to bee cured of his wounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixe hun∣dred Grisons were called home to de∣fende their owne territo¦ries.</NOTE>Much confusion beganne nowe to growe among the Kings Souldiers, and many of his mercenaries or hyred souldiers, departed before the battaile, beeing called home for the defence of theyr owne Countrey: and the num∣ber which was least, was farre lesse then indeed it was reported vnto the King▪ so that the Emperialles spying theyr aduantage, sette forwarde, and with surpassing courage inuaded the Kings Campe in the dead of the night,
<PB N="17" REF="12"/> hauing couered their armour with whole shirts, the better to discerne one an∣other. Their army was diuided into foure Battailons, the first consisting of sixe thousand Almains, Spaniards, and Italians, was led by the marquesse of <HI>Guasto,</HI> a valiant yong Gentleman, and of great towardnesse in the warres. The second consisting wholy of Spaniards, was conducted by the Marquesse of <HI>Pescara,</HI> who commanded as principall in the army: in the third and fourth battailes were the Dukes of <HI>Burbon</HI> and <HI>Lanoy,</HI> who went as resolutely to the charge as a∣ny others.</P>
<P>The King being certified of their approch, and hauing ordered his troups in as warlike manner as might bee deuised, couragiously prepared himselfe for the encounter: both armies were no sooner met,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great valor of the King.</NOTE> but the fight grew very terri∣ble on both sides, each partie doing his best for the glorie of their nation, and for the obtaining of an entire victorie. The King like a valiant captaine and no∣ble souldier, fought couragiously, and forced the marquesse of <HI>Pescara</HI> to giue ground, whereas hee being endangered to loose all, sent to the Vizroy: who had the leading of the formost battaile, to come to his succors, who vnderstan∣ding in what danger the marquesse was, furiously set on the Switzers, who that day answered not the kings expectation, &amp; breaking their array, wholy defea∣ted them in a moment. Then appeared the misery of the French, and the king himselfe was forthwith in imminent perill, albeit he fought manfully, and was seconded with a valiant troupe of French Nobilitie, who did their vttermost for their owne securitie and honor of their country: yet hauing the marquesse in his front, and <HI>Antonio de Leua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France ta∣ken prisoner.</NOTE> who was nowe issued out of <HI>Paua</HI> with al his forces, on his backe, after he had beene sore wearied and greeuously wounded, both in the face and hand, and had his horse killed vnder him, hee was forced to yeelde to fiue common Souldiers which knew him not: but shortly after the Viceroy passing by, the king called vnto him, and making himself knowne, was with great reuerence receiued, as <HI>Caesars</HI> prisoner.</P>
<P>Thus was the French king, who not long before had beene in so flourishing estate, commanding not onely ouer al <HI>France,</HI> but also a great part of <HI>Italy,</HI> being so mightie, rich, and puissant, that hee was dreaded of all his neighbor princes, subiected to a maruailous change and alteration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France sent prisoner into Spaine.</NOTE> being made first a prisoner to common souldiers, and conuaied from one place to another, vntill at length he came into Spaine, hauing left all his army to the mercie of their enemies, who slew of them well neere to the number of 10000. and among them there perished twentie of the greatest of the French Nobilitie, as <HI>Boniuet, Chauany, Monsieur de la palissa, Tremoile, Obigny,</HI> and sundry others of especiall account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great slaughter of the french Nobilitie.</NOTE> as <HI>Henry</HI> the king of <HI>Nauarre, Renee</HI> the bastard of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> Duke <HI>Memorancy, Francis</HI> of <HI>Burbon</HI> Earle of Saint <HI>Paul, Biron, Imbercourt, Floranges</HI> Colonell of the Swit∣zers, with a great number of especiall account were taken prisoners. The Duke of <HI>Alanson</HI> escaped this bloudy conflict, and recouered <HI>France</HI> with a mighty troupe of men of armes, who serued for messengers of this wofull newes.</P>
<P>The emperials lost not past some 700. men, and among them no man of any especiall account, but onely <HI>Ferdinando Castriota,</HI> the marquesse of Saint <HI>Angelo.</HI> The Spaniards were maruailously enriched with this victorie, for neuer had so few souldiers so great a bootie. The gold, siluer, and precious moueables of the

<P>All Europe was mightily dismaied with the newes of this victorie, and all estates beganne to grow iealous of the Emperials greatnesse. The Venetians of all others thought themselues most neerely touched therewith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope, the Veneti∣ans and other potentates, make a league a∣gainst the Emperour.</NOTE> and therefore they offered to ioyne with the Pope, and to hire a ten thousand Switzers to de∣fende <HI>Italy</HI> against the Emperials, hoping that the Lady Regent of <HI>France,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> and many other Princes would ioyne with them against their common enimie. In the meane time the King of <HI>France</HI> was (as is alreadie decla∣red) transported into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and sent vp into the Castle of Madrill. This was no doubt a bitter receipt, and a sharpe corrosiue to this magnanimous prince, who had not been vsed to be confined in so narrow a roume: but patience with hope was his best comfort, for the Emperour would not see him, much lesse minister any matter of consolation in that his wofull distresse, neither yet did he seeme to shewe any externall signes of ioy for so glorious a victorie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The modera∣tion of Charles the fift.</NOTE> he prohi∣bited bonefires, ringing of belles, and such like accustomed solemnities, saying that it might bee seemely to vse outwarde reioycings for victories against the Turks, Sarrazins, and other infidels, but not against christian Princes.</P>
<P>The Emperours Councell were long before they could well tell what to do with this prisoner, they beeing distracted into diuers opinions: but in the ende it was fully concluded to make as great a gaine of him as might bee, and therefore they earnestly pressed him to yeeld ouer all his claime and title, to <HI>Burgondy, Millan,</HI> and <HI>Naples:</HI> besides, hee was bound to pay a huge summe of money for his ransome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The agree∣mēt betweene the Emperor and the french King.</NOTE> and to condiscend to sundrie other things, and those so great, that no man of iudgement thought hee would bee so good as his word. Yet for assurance the King was contented to marry the Lady <HI>Elynor</HI> the Empe∣rors sister, and to grant that his two sons, the Dolphin and the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> shuld be left in hostage for the better performance of the conditions. Now was <HI>France</HI> brought to a lowe ebbe, and the auncient splendor and glorie thereof mightily obscured: yea, that renowmed Kingdome, which had beene alwaies accounted the parragon of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and hadde beene a terror vnto the Ro∣mane monarchy, sate as a desolate widow that had lost her husband, in wee∣ping, wailing, and great lamentation. But shortly after this afflicted countrey began to bee recomforted, and as it were reuiued, after it had felt the pangs of death, for the king being once set at libertie and gotten into <HI>France,</HI> sollicited o∣ther Princes, as the Pope, the king of <HI>England,</HI> the Venetians, and other states to ioyne with him, and made a strong league, and fell flat out with the emperour afresh, notwithstanding all the promises which had beene made. Then pre∣sently ensued new warres, and all <HI>Europe</HI> was in a sort infected with this conta∣gious humor. Fortune which hadde so extreamely crossed the French designe∣ments, began to be more fauourable, and to beholde the king with a smiling countenance, for the Lord <HI>Lautrech</HI> beeing sent into <HI>Italy,</HI> tooke <HI>Bosco, Genes, A∣lexandria,</HI> and <HI>Pauia</HI> from the emperour, maruaylously aduauncing the French affaires.</P>
<P>The emperour beeing vexed at the heart with these newes, complained
<PB N="19" REF="13"/> greeuously of the king, offering him the Combate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe∣rour offereth the combate to the french King.</NOTE> calling him forsworne and periured prince; the King gaue him the lie, and affirmed that hee would make it good vpon his body, when and where he durst. Thus did these mightie po∣tentates fight a farre off with their tongues, and their armies in <HI>Italy,</HI> and other where sought to ruinate and ouerthrow each other by all possible meanes. Af∣ter many conflicts, wherein sometime the emperials, and sometime the French as it were alternatiuely had the better, there was a peace concluded for tenne yeeres: in which time the Emperour in very freendly and louing manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace be∣tweene the Emperor and the French King.</NOTE> pas∣sed through <HI>France,</HI> to represse certaine tumultuous outrages committed in <HI>Flanders.</HI> This peace beeing expired, they fell again into new broyles, but they were soone ended: and nowe began <HI>France</HI> to bee scourged with the English, who hauing gotten <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> wasted their countrey round about.

In the whole there were some thirtie thousand footmen, French, Almains and Switzers: and about seuen or eight thousand horsmen. The Emperor being troubled with the gout, lay long before he attempted any thing, so that October was halfe past, insomuch as the French King seeing the yeare so farre spent, supposed that hee would doo nothing, especially agaynst <HI>Metz,</HI> which was a place of very great strength, and plentifullie stored with all necessaries. And the rather for that his principall captaines, and chieftaines of greatest experience disswaded him all that might be, from enterprising any further, vntill some better oportunitie. Notwithstanding, the emperor would not hearken to their counsels, nor be di∣uerted by any meanes, but with all possible speede planted his armie before the towne, in this maner following.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> was sent before, with the choisest of the emperiall armie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The siege of Metz.</NOTE> who passing the riuer of <HI>Seille,</HI> emcamped as neare the towne as he could, and bestowed sundry of his forces in the strongest forts adioyning.

The Se∣neschall of <HI>Morauia,</HI> with the Bohemian Horsemen, encamped at <HI>Blery,</HI> and the rest at <HI>Ollerie,</HI> Saint <HI>Preich,</HI> and other places neare abouts. All things beeing in a readinesse, the emperials beganne to beate the Towne with their great Ordinance, in verie furious sort, and in all hostile maner to annoy the defen∣dants. The batterie continued long, and yet the harme was but small, neither could the breach be made sufficient for an assault. Whereupon they remoued the Canon to another part of the Citie. And falling to mining, supposed to o∣uerthrow some peece of the wall with Gunpowder. But the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> vnderstanding the drift of his enemyes, caused countermynes to bee made, wherein they had not trauailed long, but they might heare the noyse and stirring of the Spaniardes, and so were theyr deuises easily preuented. This was no small discouragement to the Emperials, seeing they preuailed not, neyther by one meanes nor other. Besides the season of the yeare grewe ex∣treame colde, insomuch as the Souldiours which lay in the fieldes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperi∣als weary of the siege.</NOTE> were sore pinched, and many dyed for want of necessaries: so that all sortes beganne to waxe wearie of the siege, and inwardly desired to be dismissed. The Almaines themselues began to quaile: yet as men that would win some honour, they in∣stantly craued of the Emperour, that he would commaund a sufficient breach
<PB N="22" REF="15"/> to be made, and they would either enter, or loose their liues, for th y were not able to keepe the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld any longer. Then began he to before greeued, foresee∣ing the miserable end that would ensue, of that his rash and inconsiderate enter∣prise, yet would he in no wise consent to raise his siege, but with great perswa∣sions animated his souldiours to persist, promising that if he could not make a sufficient breach before the newe yeare, he would breake vp his armie, and li∣cence euery man to depart.</P>
<P>This satisfied them for the time, and made them to temporise, &amp; expect their better fortune. And to the ende they might all be assured of his great care to perfourme this: he priuately commaunded the Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> to continue the mines with all diligence. Which charge was so willingly accepted, and so care∣fully performed, that the pioners ceassed neither day nor night. But the season of the yeare was so contrary, and so repugnant, that nothing could bee accom∣plished as was desired. Besides, the French who were in the Towne, with their often sallying forth, did exceedingly endomage them, and slue many. So that what with the colde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor resolueth to depart from Metz, the <HI>10.</HI> of Decem¦ber. <HI>1553.</HI></NOTE> and extremitie of the winter, and the couragious attempts of the French, the Emperours army dayly diminished, and yet nothing to the purpose performed. Which when with intollerable sorrowe and vexation of spirit hee considered, he resolued to depart. And sending away his great Or∣dinaunce before, with his other weightiest and most troublesome carria∣ges, himselfe followed with the rest of his armie, which was so feeble, and so weake with famine and sickenesse, that they were scarce able to go. The Duke of <HI>Neuers</HI> was left by the King, to attende the Emperour, and to watch him at euerie turne. VVho carefully executing his masters commaun∣dement, followed the emperials in the taile, and cut off sundrie as they strayed from the grosse of the armie.</P>

<P>The French king being certified by the duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> of all that had passed, was exceeding ioyfull, and seemed to triumph ouer the emperor, who being a Prince that could not well brooke any indignity, fought still to bee reuenged.

The towne being defended with so strong a garrison, and sufficiently prouided of all necessaries, was thought to bee tenable agaynst the strongest
<PB N="23" REF="15"/> enemie that was: and therfore the emperials were suffred to do what they listed. Who endeuouring to effect some notable exploit, laboured night and day, and made their approches without any empeachment, placing their batterie vpon a little mount, from whence they might annoy the defendants at their pleasure. They had brought with them all warlike prouision, as powder, shot, and all sorts of great and small Ordinance, from sundry townes and castels of <HI>Flanders.</HI> For this place was so odious vnto all that inhabited neare vnto it, that as soone as it was besieged, not onely the women and little children, ranne thither to be∣hold so gladsome a sight, but in token of their ioies, they sung songs, with daun∣cing and leaping, and brought into the campe, corne, beere, bread, sheepe, and beeues, in great abundance.</P>
<P>Their battery being once planted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The furious batterie of Teroanne.</NOTE> they began to beat the towne in such furi∣ous sort, that the besieged were exceedingly endaungered, no place being free from iminent perill. Notwithstanding, like men of valour and courage, they re∣solutely defended themselues, often issuing forth, and fighting with the empe∣rials in their trenches, killed many of them, &amp; poisoning some of their great Or∣dinance, drew other some into the towne in despite of their enemies. And albeit the emperials were much endomaged herewith, yet were they so readily relie∣ued from other places, and all their wants so diligently supplied, that they easily amended as much in a day, as the French had marred in a week. So that wanting nothing that might either helpe themselues, or hurt their enemies, they ceased neither day nor night, but thundring continually with the Canon, beat downe the walles, and ouethrew the Towers and Bulwarks, leauing nothing in a ma∣ner vnder which the besieged might shroud themselues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The courage of the besie∣ged.</NOTE> Howbeit they labored continually to repaire the breaches, and as men desperate and carelesse of their owne securitie, they would be most busie where the Canon was most furious, bringing earth, dung, fagots, and such like necessarie matter for defence. Which continuall trauell did maruellously weaken the defendants, and by reason they were no great number, they were forced to be both souldiors and pioners, to watch in the night, and fight in the day, alwayes in action without ceasing or intermission. In the midst of these great extremities, there entred into the towne one called captaine <HI>Greille,</HI> with a hundred <HI>Carabins.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine Greille en∣treth Tero∣anne with <HI>100.</HI> Cara∣bins.</NOTE> Who forcing the enemies <HI>Corps degard,</HI> with the losse of a fewe of his men, was readily receiued by the French, who attended his comming with great deuotion.</P>
<P>The assailants were nothing discouraged herewith, but plied their batterie more hotely then before, shooting for the space of ten dayes togither. And ha∣uing beaten downe all their flankers, and other places of defence, and therwith∣all made a reasonable breach of sixtie paces in breadth, prepared to giue an as∣sault Collonell, which the French resolued to abide. Then stroke vp the drums, the trumpets soūded, the ensignes were displaied, &amp; the emperials marched on, with crying, showting, and after their maner making a terrible noyse &amp; appro∣ching the breach, striued to enter with maruellous furie.

<PB N="24" REF="16"/>
<P>The King of <HI>Fraunce</HI> vnderstanding of the noble valour of his men, albeit hee feared not the losse of the towne, yet the more to animate them, hee sent a new supplie of three hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breuit and S.

They without still continued their siege, and what with raysing forts without, and with vn∣dermining within the ground, they endomaged the besieged more thē before. And hauing after much ado enlarged the breach, and made the ascent so easie, that a man of Armes might passe out and in at pleasure, they cryed to a newe assault. The French beeng greatly dismayed herewith, and knowing they wanted all necessaryes to defende themselues anie longer, demaunded a parlee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Teroanne surprised by the emperials whilest the French are talking of a composition.</NOTE> whereto the emperials yeelded. But whilest they were talking, the Almaines and Burgonians entered in sundrie places, and the Spaniardes approached the great breach. And so was the Towne taken without anie resistaunce. The Almaines and Burgonians enraged agaynst the poore French, committed manie barbarous factes, and straunge cruelties, killing and murthering whō soeuer fel into their hands. <HI>Francis Memorancie</HI> hardly sca∣ped, and was led prisoner to <HI>Binecour,</HI> lieutenant to the emperor. <HI>Martigues, Dam∣pier, de Losses, Bandiment, Baylet, Saint Roman,</HI> and sundry other great captains, yeel∣ded themselues to such as would take them. The towne was sacked and spoiled: whatsoeuer was worth any thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Teroanne is dismanteled.</NOTE> was caried away by the emperials: the em∣peror commanded it should be dismanteled, and the houses fired: so that in short time it was vtterly spoiled and defaced.</P>
<P>When as the French King vnderstood of this losse, he was wonderfully gree∣ued, and fearing least the emperor, (who was on the other side as ioifull for the good newes) would follow his fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French K. gathereth a great power to resist the Emperor. Hedyn besie∣ged and won by the Em∣perials.</NOTE> and besiege <HI>Hedyn,</HI> he gathered a strong power of French and Switzers, and made all things ready, with as great celeritie as might be, to stop the enemies proceedings, if need required: but it was so long before his troupes could be assembled, that the emperials vnder the leading of the Prince of <HI>Piemont,</HI> were gotten before the towne, which they straightly be∣sieged, &amp; battered on all sides. And for that it was not very well fortified, it was quickly gained. There were slaine on the French part, <HI>Horatius Farnelius</HI> duke of <HI>Castres, Martigues, Monuille, Cizieux, Lusignan, Dampier,</HI> and diuerse other cap∣tains and commaunders. The duke of <HI>Bouillon, Riou,</HI> the Count <HI>Villars,</HI> with the baron of <HI>Culan,</HI> were taken prisoners. The King was more and more inwardly vexed to see himselfe thus thwarted. Wherfore assembling his army neere vnto <HI>Amiens</HI> and <HI>Piquenny,</HI> vnder the leading of the Constable, hee waited his opor∣tunitie to be reuenged of his enemies: who after the taking of <HI>Heyden,</HI> spoyled the frontiers of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> without pitie or mercie. The French espying theyr ad∣uauntage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French killeth seuen or eight hun∣dred Empe∣rials.</NOTE> set vpon them on the suddaine, and slue seuen or eight hundred, and tooke the duke of <HI>Askot</HI> prisoner, and almost fiue hundred others. This losse somewhat abated the pride of the emperiall souldiours, and encouraged the French to attempt greater matters: for they presently marched towards <HI>Baupalme</HI> which was very well manned, &amp; sufficiently appointed of all necessaries, &amp; en∣camping before the town, straitly enuironed it on al sides.

The French seeing the resolution of the defendants, &amp; finding an exceeding want of water, which could not by any meanes be supplied, were enforced to depart, &amp; to defer their siege vntil some other time, hauing first spoiled and wasted all the country roūd about, and so marched towards <HI>Cambray,</HI> where hauing summoned the towne, and seeing he could not be suffred to enter, he fired the suburbs, &amp; vsing all kind of hostilitie towards them, tooke certaine litle castles and holds neer adioyning.

<P>The emperor was not a little vexed with these French brauados, and enuying the glory of the King, sought for nothing so much as for reuenge, wherfore ca∣sting about how he might best effect his desire, he first compassed a mariage be∣tweene <HI>Marie</HI> Queene of <HI>England,</HI> and his sonne <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French King gathe∣reth three new armies.</NOTE> there∣by to strengthen and fortifie himselfe, the better agaynst <HI>Fraunce.</HI> VVhich when King <HI>Henrie</HI> vnderstood, he againe gathered his forces, with all conueni∣ent speede, purposing indede to preuent the Emperour, or at least to meete with him as soone as anie oportunitie serued.

<P>The Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> who had taken vppon him to keepe that quarter, seeing with what courage the emperials maintained the fight, supposed they were wel backed, whereupon hee presently sent word to the King, that he imagined the emperor was comming with all his forces, and that there was great likelihood of a battaile as that day: vppon which aduertisement the king forthwith arran∣ged his troups in as warlike manner as he might, &amp; sent word to the <HI>Guyse,</HI> that
<PB N="28" REF="18"/> if oportunitie serued hee should accept of the iourney, and hee would be rea∣die to assist him. Then began the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> to encourage his souldiers, and to animate them with the best words he could deuise: and putting himselfe in the front of his Regiment, waited his best oportunitie to assaile his enemie. In the meane while the Conestable passed ouer a little riuer, with certaine com∣panyes on foote, and the whole battaile of the Switzers, who were wonder∣fully encouraged with the presence of the King, that had promised to liue and die with them.</P>
<P>By this time the Emperials were so farre aduaunced, that they had beaten the foure hundred shot out of the wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The french charge the Emperials.</NOTE> and appeared ful in the face of the for∣most battailon of the French, and beeing fauoured by theyr Reisters, ap∣proched within two hundred paces of the Duke, who presently commanded to charge them.

<P>There were taken seauenteene ensignes, fiue Cornets, and foure field peeces. The French pursued their victorie, and slew to the number of some sixe or sea∣uen hundred of these runnawaies, chasing them hard to their trenches. Thus did fortune still fauour the French kings proceeding, and crossed the Emperor almost in all his enterprises.</P>
<P>After this victorie the Emperour would no more be drawen to fight, but kept himselfe with all his forces, emparked within his strength: which the French king perceiuing, hee determined to retire towards <HI>Monterell,</HI> to refresh his wearie armie, leauing <HI>Reuty</HI> as a thing that would not bee gotten in haste: where he staied not long but remooued towards <HI>Champeigne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king and the Emperor dissolue their armies.</NOTE> and hauing for∣tified <HI>Bouloin,</HI> and sundrie other frontier Townes, brake vp his Armie, and licensed euerie man to depart: but this was no sooner knowne to the Em∣perour, but hee taking the oportunitie, sent his forces to spoyle the frontiers of France, where there was made a pittious spoyle in a short time. At length the Emperour likewise dissolued his troups, and stuffing his Townes with strong garrisons, thought it best to expect some better oportunitie to accom∣plish his desires.</P>
<P>Winter was no sooner past, but that the French king, who was somewhat

And albeit there was great meanes made to reconcile these two mightie potentates, yet nothing could bee effected: for the french King required <HI>Naples, Millan, Burgundy, Piemont, Nauarre,</HI> and many other places: and the Emperour would part with no∣thing, so that the treatie being broken off, warre presently ensued: for the Em∣perour hauing a power in a readinesse vnder the leading of <HI>Martin Ronsare</HI> the bastard of <HI>Cleue,</HI> inuaded the territories belonging to the <HI>Flower de Lis,</HI> burning, spoyling, and wasting in most outragious manner: but this stormie tempest continued not long, for the emperials began to fal sick of many disea∣ses, and to want victuals, so that they were forced to retire, hauing lost their ge∣nerall and many others of especiall account. Thus did the Emperour stande still in fortunes disgrace, and nothing seemed to prosper that he tooke in hand, vntill mid <HI>August</HI> following, that shee began to returne her fauour towardes him, by giuing him as it were some good words, after so many sharpe and bit∣ter checks.

<P><MILESTONE N="1555"/> While the emperor and the king were thus busied in the frontiers of <HI>Picardy,</HI> their armies vnder the leading of the mareschall <HI>Brissack</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> sought to anoy each other in <HI>Piemont.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Casal surpri∣sed by Cap∣tayne Sal∣uoyson.</NOTE> Captaine <HI>Saluoyson</HI> surprised <HI>Casal</HI> in the dead of the night, being one of the strongest and best fortified places in all those quarters: wherein were taken <HI>Figuerot</HI> gouernor of the Towne, and the Count <HI>Ladron,</HI> general of the Almaines, and maruailous store of all necessarie prouisi∣on for the warres. <HI>Monsieur de Termes</HI> preuailed mightily in <HI>Italy,</HI> and ouer∣threw the emperials at <HI>Senes</HI> with great slaughter and mortalitie: but he being called home, <HI>Strozzi</HI> was appoynted Leiutenant in his place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strozzi o∣uerthrowne by the Em∣perials.</NOTE> who fighting with the emperialles was wholy defeated: and <HI>Clermont, Moulbazon, Blaise</HI> with the Collonels of the Switzers were slain, with sundry others, to the num∣ber of three hundred: and fiue hundred were taken prisoners.</P>

<P>Thus was <HI>Calice</HI> in lesse then seuen daies recouered by the French (which had bin besieged by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, king of <HI>England,</HI> by the space of a whole yere, and which had remained in the English mens hands for the space of 210. yeres) to the incredible ioy of the French. And as it was lost vnder <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lip of Valois</HI> the French King: so was it regained by the French, in the time of <HI>Philip</HI> king of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> The duke folowing his good fortune, did forthwith besiege <HI>Guines,</HI> wher∣in commaunded the valiant lord <HI>Gray,</HI> who albeit he did stoutly hold out for a time, abiding the planting of the Canon, and a furious assault, yet was he forced in the end to yeeld, and to resigne his office to another man. Which when the garrison of <HI>Hams</HI> vnderstood, they abandoned the fort, &amp; withdrew themselues to a place of greater securitie. The French king was not a little ioyfull to heare these newes: wherefore longing to see that, which he had so often wished and desired, he posted presently to visit his new conquered towne: whither he was no sooner come, but that he gaue order for the repairing and fortifying thereof, and leauing <HI>Monsieur de Thermes</HI> gouernor, withdrew himselfe againe towards <HI>Paris,</HI> commanding the <HI>Guise</HI> to besiege <HI>Herbemont,</HI> a place of some importance: which was yeelded at the first summance. Thus did fortune begin to turne her countenance towards the French, and as it were alternatiuely, and by course fa∣uour the Kings desigments.</P>
<P>The French K: intending to prosecute his wars against the Spaniards, thought it good policie to strengthen himselfe with some forrein alliance and therefore contriued a marriage betweene <HI>Mary</HI> the yong Queene of <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Francis</HI> the Dolphin of <HI>France.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Francis the Dolphin of France mar∣ryeth Marie Queene of Scots.</NOTE> Which mariage was solemnized at <HI>Paris,</HI> in most royall and magnificent maner, the 14. of Aprill 1558.

But the alarum being giuen, the French were soone repul∣sed, with the losse of many of their principall and most forward men: the besie∣ged were much dismaid with this vnlooked for accident, and the remembrance of their manifold wants made them to doubt of the sequell of the siege, where∣vpon <HI>Caderobbe</HI> who was gouernour of the towne, knowing he was not able to holde out for any long time, sent a trumpet to demaund a parle, offering to yeeld vpon reasonable conditions: which when the Duke had assented vnto, and the articles were fully agreed vpon, the place was giuen vp the 22. of Iune 1558. vn∣to the French, who entered with great triumphs, and repairing the battered walles, made them as defensible as they could.</P>
<P>This and the like prosperous successe somewhat cheered the French nation, and made their name seeme terrible to the Spaniards, who had for a time beene exceedingly crossed in most of their affayres. But nowe the worlde beganne to change, &amp; fortune which is euer instable, frowned vpon the French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First of No∣uember.</NOTE> by crossing the designes of <HI>Monsieur de Termes,</HI> the captaine of <HI>Calice.</HI> Who desirous to doo some especiall seruice for his late preferment, inuaded the confines of <HI>Flanders,</HI> with an army of 9000. footmen, &amp; 1500. horse, and by an assault tooke <HI>Dunkirk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur de Termes in∣uadeth the low countries</NOTE> leauing <HI>Graueling</HI> on his backe, with a purpose to enterprise against that also if oportunitie serued, and so passed forth hard vnto <HI>Newport,</HI> cruelly wasting with fire and sword, whatsoeuer was in his way. For the repressing of whose furious and barbarous rage, Count <HI>Egmond</HI> assembled a power of 12000. on foote, and 3000. horsmen: of whose approch when <HI>Termes</HI> was ascertained by his espials, he began to retire with al speed, being indeed not able to encounter with so strong and resolute an enemy: wherfore vsing the benefit of a low water, he marched away in the dead of the night along by the sea, hoping to deceiue the count, and to free himselfe from the danger of the Dutch. But the count <HI>Egmond</HI> vnderstan∣ding of the retreat of the French, suspecting that they hasted to get out of his hands, crossed the country by a nearer way, and put himselfe between them and home, meeting them in the front not farre from <HI>Graueling.</HI> He was no sooner in view of the enemy, but he caused the signall to be giuen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Count Eg∣mont ouer∣throweth de Termes, and taketh him prisoner.</NOTE> &amp; like a general of sur∣passing courage, went resolutely to the charge.

<PB N="36" REF="22"/> saw so broken and dismembred, supposing the day had bin theirs, they cried out victorie, victorie. But this acclamation lasted not long: for the Count <HI>Egmond</HI> arriuing with a great Hot of Reisters, and Flemings, so furiously charged the French launces, that they were wholy defeated and ouerthrowne.</P>
<P>Amids these bloody broils hapned a strange chance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange chance.</NOTE> for at the same time, cer∣taine English ships passing by, and descrying this encounter, made towards the shore, and with their shot beat the flanks of the French army, which on this side lay open to a ful batterie: wherewith they being sore dismaid, and not able to in∣dure the fight any longer, turned their backs and fled amain. There were some 1500. slaine in that place. And the greatest number of such as escaped, were kil∣led by the boores and women of the country who made hauocke of as many as fel into their hands. <HI>Monsieur de Termes, D'annebault, Senarpont, Meruilliers,</HI> &amp; sun∣dry others of the principall captains remained prisoners. Moreouer they lost all their Ordinance, ensignes, munition, bag and baggage, and all their rich booties which they had gotten in Flanders. This sinister chance did not a little vexe the French King, who fearing a further mischiefe if it were not timely preuented, sent forth presently for his Bannes &amp; Arierbannes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French K. mustreth new forces.</NOTE> with a straight commaunde∣ment to all his ordinance and men of armes, to assemble themselues at <HI>Pierreport</HI> in as warlike maner as might be, there to attend his further pleasure, and to be in a readinesse to be employed as occasion should be offered.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> had likewise gathered a very strong power, and al things were prouided by these two mightie Monarkes, as though they ment to deter∣mine all their controuersies by some one cruel &amp; bloody battell. But God who ruleth the hearts of princes, disposed of their intentions far otherwise then their blind affections led them. For vpō the sudden, their hard harts began to be mol∣lified, and each party inclined to peace: so that the place being appointed, and the deputies on both sides agreed vpon, they met about the midst of October follo∣wing at <HI>Cercam,</HI> betweene <HI>Artoys</HI> and <HI>Pycardy.</HI> There were many complaints on both sides, and a commemoration of sundry indignities offered on either part. Each defended others doings, neither was there any likelihood of better agree∣ment: <MILESTONE N="1559"/> so that after many contentious words, their assembly brake vp, without a∣ny cōclusion for peace: and yet, for that winter approched, &amp; the soldiers were not able to keep the field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace con∣cluded be∣tween France and Spaine.</NOTE> both princes dissolued their armies, and licenced their men of warre to repose themselues vntill the next yere. But before that time, by reason of newe occurrences, there was a generall peace proclaimed betweene these two nations, &amp; each linked with other with very strait alliances: For King <HI>Philip</HI> (whose wife <HI>Mary</HI> Queene of <HI>England</HI> was lately deceassed) was conten∣ted to take in marriage <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the eldest daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> the French King, and <HI>Pilebert Emmanuel</HI> duke of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> was affianced vnto madame <HI>Margaret</HI> his sister: so that by reason of these new cōiunctions, there insued much quietnes to all Christendome, but especially to these two kingdoms, who now had made an end of all their quarels &amp; contentions, and seemed to study of nothing but how they might honor and solemnise in most royall maner these new marriages.</P>
<P>There was exceeding sumptuous preparation against the appointed time: all the Nobilitie of <HI>France</HI> were assembled at <HI>Paris,</HI> to attend the king, &amp; to honor these espousals. The lady <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was cōducted by the king her father to our
<PB N="37" REF="22"/> Lady Church at the day prefixed in most pompous and stately maner, and there married by the Cardinall of <HI>Burbon,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> was who constituted Procurator of the king of <HI>Spaine</HI> his maister.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Alua mar∣rieth the French kings daughter for his maister the king of Spaine.</NOTE> There were all the princes of the bloud attending in their order, and many cheefe Prelates, and all the officers of the crowne. The Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> was accompanied with the Prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> Count <HI>Egmond,</HI> and sundrie other very honourable personages. The marriage being finished, there was exceeding feasting, banquetting, and cheering, with dauncing, masking, and all other pastimes that could be imagined, both to de∣light the eye and please the eare. The king reioyced to see his daughter so ho∣nourably aduanced: the Nobilitie and commonaltie were maruailously glad to remember what ease, peace, and tranquilitie they should enioy by this newe affinitie: and all sorts seemed to triumph, hoping there would be a perpetuall league and corespondency betweene these two Nations: but now behold a woful mishap and lamentable mischance, wherewith all this mirth and iollity was turned into weeping, wailing, and great sorrow: so enterchangeably doo these two accompany each other, &amp; so certainely do they follow one another.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Kingdome of <HI>France</HI> had for manie yeares togither, beene ve∣rie well acquainted with the variable and changeable estate of vnconstaunt fortune, and vnder <HI>Charles</HI> the eight, <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth, <HI>Francis</HI> the first, and <HI>Henrie</HI> the seconde, had by wo∣full experience found, how subiect the most flourishing estates, kingdoms &amp; cōmonwealths are to a continuall change and alteration: and ther∣fore hauing by long obseruatiō perfitly learned, that the best means to maintain her selfe in her wonted grandeur and glory, was to be leagued with her neigh∣bour
<PB N="38" REF="23"/> Countries, and to be at peace and vnitie at home, beganne to haue a flexible heart, and to encline to quietnesse as much as might bee: so that hauing ended all quarrels, and buried all wronges and indignities in the pit of obliuion, and by a neare coniunction with the Spanyard her ancient and migh∣tie enemy, (in the opinion of most men) procured her selfe a perpetuall peace, began as it were, to clap her handes for ioy, and seriously to tryumph in so in∣comparable a benefite. But the fatall and ineuitable mishap of this most noble kingdome, which had florished for so many hundred yeares, and had been the paragon of her neighbor nations, could not (as it seemeth) be auoyded, but that it must needes take place, and wanting forraigne enemies to worke her ouer∣throw, must needes hatch a viperous brood, which by gnawing out the belly of their owne mother, haue most vnnaturally sought the destruction of her, who haue most tenderly fostered and brought them vp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The house of Guyse, the principall cause of all the sturres in France.</NOTE>The principall cause to produce so lamentable an effect, and the only means in a maner to hatch so horrible a mischiefe, was the immesurable ambition of that haughtie and aspiring house of <HI>Guyse:</HI> who albeit they were straungers, and no natural French men, yet fortune so fauoured their attempts, and made some of them so gracious with their soueraignes, that they did not only contend for the superioritie with the greatest Princes of the blood, but at length (as ambiti∣on hath neuer any end) striued with their liege Lords, and through their rebel∣lious counsels and most trayterous plottes, assisted by a multitude of Guysards and Hispaniolized French, draue their soueraigne Lord out of his chiefe Citie: and not contented to offer so great indignitie to so mightie a potentate, neuer left practising, vntill they had most wickedly murthered him, whose life in all dutie should haue beene vnto them more precious then their owne: and with their diuellish sorceries, haue so bewitched and sotted sundry of the French na∣tion, that at this day, to their perpetuall shame and ignominy, they will not be reduced vnto any dutifull obedience vnder their most lawfull and liege Lord.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Francis Duke of Guyse, and Charles Car∣dinal of Lor∣rain, the two fire-brands of France.</NOTE>One of the most notorious plotters of so many mischiefes, was <HI>Francis</HI> Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> who with his brother <HI>Charles</HI> Cardinall of <HI>Lorrain</HI> (as proud, subtil, and as ambitious a prelate as euer was) grew to that height, through the benefit of their good fortune, that they commanded all <HI>France,</HI> and brought the greatest Princes of that natiō to be their vnderlings: and by reason of a mariage between <HI>Francis</HI> the second, with <HI>Mary</HI> the yoong Queene of Scottes their neece, they bare themselues so loftely, and so egerly stroue to aduance their house, that they turned all <HI>France</HI> topsy turuy, so chaunging the gouernment and altering the state, that it seemed in a short time to be a meere <HI>Chaos,</HI> and confusion. For after the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the secōd, and that <HI>Francis</HI> his sonne was crowned King, these two so craftily handled the matter, that ioyning with <HI>Katherin de Medices,</HI> the Queen mother of <HI>France,</HI> (who contrary to the auncient lawes and ordinances of that Realme, which permit not women to rule, sought to haue the gouern∣ment of the yoong King, and to exclude <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon</HI> King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and chiefe Prince of the blood) after infinite troubles to themselues, and vnspeake∣able misery to their owne Country, they gat the gouernment into their hands, and swayed euery thing after their owne likings.</P>
<P>And albeit the state of that kingdome had begun long before to be much af∣flicted,
<PB N="39" REF="23"/> and through the horrible persecutions of those whom they termed <HI>Hu∣gonots,</HI> maruellously decayed and weakned, by reason of a secret diuision bred in the hearts of infinit multitudes, who once dissenting in Religion, could ne∣uer after well agree in matters of state: yet was the land at peace within it selfe, and euery one seemed to be enclinable to their princes pleasure, choosing ra∣ther to endure any affliction, then by seeking to defend their liues and liberties by force of armes, to bring in any intestine warres, the most deuouring plague and sharpest punishment of all other: but after that the house of <HI>Guyse</HI> began to rule, and that their factious deuises cloaked with a zeale of mainteining the Ca∣tholicke cause, had once stirred the coales, the flame presently brake foorth, and finding conuenient matter to nourish it withall, spread it selfe in a short time ouer the face of the whole kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> to the consuming of in∣finite multitudes of all sorts, and the extreame impouerishing of the whole land.</P>
<P>There were sundry and diuers meanes to hasten this so wonderfull and la∣mentable alteration in <HI>France,</HI> but the principall of all other, was the vnexpec∣ted death of t e late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queene mother, the King of Na∣uarre and the Duke of Guyse, con∣tend for the gouernment during the noneage of the King.</NOTE> who albeit hee verie seuerely punished all such as were accounted Protestants, and that principally at the instigation of the house of <HI>Guyse,</HI> yet did he so politikely carry himselfe, that during his raigne, he kept that ambitious monster in some reasonable good order, and the whole lande from tumult and rebellion: but he was no sooner dead, but that all things be∣ganne to hasten to a confusion, and the whole common wealth to bee daun∣gerously infected with sundry fearefull diseases, the originall whereof arose in this maner.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reigne of <HI>Francis</HI> the second, being but sixteene yeares olde, there grewe a controuersie betweene <HI>Katherin de Medices</HI> the Kings mother, <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon</HI> King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Lorraigne,</HI> Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> touching the gouernment of the young King during his non∣age. The Queene-mother alleaged many reasons to strengthen her claime, as the lawes of Nature, which would that the mother should haue the brin∣ging vp of her children, as one hauing a most tender care ouer them, and most willing of all others to doo them good, the customes and vsages of sundry na∣tions, and the auncient order of the lande, which made the mother <HI>Gardien</HI> of her childe: and so by consequent gaue her the Regency of the kingdome. The king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> on the contrary affirmed, that he ought in right to be gouernour of the young king, for that he was the next Prince of the blood, and nearest of kinne vnto him: besides that there were fundamentall lawes of that nation, which did not only shut out all straungers, (by whom he vn∣derstood the house of <HI>Lorraine</HI> and of <HI>Guyse</HI>): but also disabled the Queene mo∣ther, by reason of her sexe, which the <HI>Salique</HI> lawe did expresly exclude from all regency, and succession to the Crowne. The Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> had also di∣uers reasons for the aduauncing of his owne title, as that hee was the kinges vncle: that by his seruice the whole state had bene in a maner mainteined, and the land from sundry imminent perilles deliuered. Besides he excepted in a sort against the king of <HI>Nauarre:</HI> for that hee and his brother the Prince of <HI>Condy,</HI> gaue euident tokens of their liking of the Gospel, and their hatred of
<PB N="40" REF="24"/> the Romish Religion: so that if <HI>Nauarre</HI> shoulde haue the gouernement of the King, it was to bee feared (saide hee) that the whole lande would fall into heresie.</P>
<P>Thus did these three contende with might and maine for the superio∣rite, each of them deuising al the reasons they could imagine for the furtherance of their cause.</P>
<P>But in the ende, the Queene Mother, and the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> doub∣ting that they shoulde not bee able nor sufficient to preuaile, and also fea∣ring least that the King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> (by reason of the great preheminence and authoritie that the princes of the blood shoulde by right haue, besides his iust tytle) shoulde in the ende preuayle and get the better agaynst them both, thought it best to ioyne togither agaynst the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queene mother, and D. of Guise, ioine togither against Na∣uarre.</NOTE> and eyther by force, or by policie and fayre meanes to winne him vnto their willes, and by some deuise or other to make him surcease from his iust claime, and interest.</P>
<P>The better to effect this, the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> seysed vppon the king, whome hee conducted and brought to the <HI>Louure</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> with the yong Princes his Brethren, and with the two Queenes, leauing the Princes of the blood, the Conestable, the Mareschall, the Admirall, and sundrie other noble and great personages attending vpon the dead Corps of the late king <HI>Henrie.</HI></P>
<P>When they hadde preuailed in their purpose thus farre, then was there such watch and warde kept about the King, that no man might speake vnto him, but in the presence of some of the Guyses: and the matter was so well handled in the ende, that the Cardinall and the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> ruled and go∣uourned all things, and hadde the king in a manner at their will and comman∣dement.</P>
<P>Then beganne they to bring into the kings Councell men of their owne faction, and to procure the kinges displeasure vnto such as they disliked. The rulers and gouernours of the Citties, Townes, and Prouinces were at their appointment: the Princes of the bloud were imployed in busines far from the Court.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> was sent into <HI>Flanders</HI> to treate of the league made betweene <HI>Fraunce</HI> and <HI>Spaine:</HI> the king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Cardinall of <HI>Burbon,</HI> and the Prince <HI>De la Roch sur Yon</HI> were sent to conduct the kings Sister into <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>There were many deuises and fetches to mooue the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> to giue ouer his claime and title which hee made to the Regencie of the young King, and many faire promises were procured out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> conditionally that he would so doo.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The proude letters of the K. of Spaine.</NOTE>And among others there were letters sent to that purpose, wherein the Spanish king promised that if he would be ruled herein, he would restore him the kingdome of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> of which he held nothing but the title auerring fur∣ther, &amp; that very imperiously, &amp; with threatening words, that if he did other∣wise, he would take vpon him the protection of his brother in law himself, and
<PB N="41" REF="24"/> spend all that euer he had, yea, his owne life and the liues of fortie thousand o∣thers, whom he had in a readinesse in maintaining the quarrell.</P>
<P>Thus partly with faire promises, and partly with threats, the King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> began to be cold, and in a manner quiet, and cleane to giue ouer the matter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Nauarre giueth ouer his claime.</NOTE> When the <HI>Guyse</HI> perceiued this, then did he proceede further, hauing the coun∣tenance of the yong King, and being backed so strongly with the Spanish king, so that nowe hee put out and in whome hee listed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pride of Guyse.</NOTE> and incroched vppon the offices of other men▪ hee would not sticke to meddle with the Conestableship and great maister of <HI>France,</HI> arrogating that vnto himselfe which of right be∣longed vnto others. The high courts of Parliament were full of his followers, and whom soeuer he suspected not to fauour his designes, these were by some one sinister information or other, presently disgraced, insomuch as those fewe good men that were in place, considering the rough handling, and seuere v∣sage of sundry well affected persons, and the small good that ensued by com∣plaining vnto the King were content to be silent, and not to meddle in such dangerous times.</P>
<P>The Cardinall of <HI>Guyse</HI> was appoynted ouer the Kings finances: the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brother was made Lieutenant generall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Card<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nall of Guyse made Lorde treasurer, and the duke his brother Lieutenant generall for the King.</NOTE> and had the direction of all matters appertaining vnto the warres, and all Captaines, gouernors of townes, and other officers were commanded to obey him, as the King himselfe. Thus hadde these two gotten the sole authoritie into their hands, and although the Queene mother was at the first the meanes to procure them so great place, and to make them so neere about the king, yet not long after shee repented her thereof, and sought many waies to curb them, and to keepe them as short as shee might: yet shee beeing a most vncertaine and inconstant woman, and e∣uer inclining to the worst, still rather held with them, then with the princes of the bloud, who beganne to waxe wearie of the intollerable pride of the <HI>Guyse,</HI> and the burning, murthering, and iniurious dealing of that bloudy house. The <HI>Guyse</HI> no sooner suspected that their hearts were alienated, but that hee studied day and night howe to ouerthrow them, and to cause the King to embrew his handes in the bloud of his owne kinred. While these mischiefes were thus in platting, and many outragious parts plaied tending to the strengthening of this factious house, and the vtter ouerthrow of the ancient Nobilitie of <HI>France,</HI> in∣finite multitudes grewe maruailous discontented, and both by word and wri∣ting shewed theyr mislike of the present gouernement, exclaiming against the sore persecutions of those of the reformed Religion, and the intollerable wronges and iniuries offered vnto sundrie of the Kings best affected subiects.</P>
<P>There were many supplications presented vnto the Queene mother, to the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and others of greatest place &amp; authoritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guyse setteth the King against the princes of the bloud.</NOTE> tending to the refor∣mation of these miseries, but they were little or nothing regarded: for the Queene mother fauoured not the Protestants in her heart, though often in the beginning made some shewe thereof, and gaue some helpe to the persecuted Hugonots. The King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> was timorous, and would not prosecute the cause with such a courage as hee ought to haue done: besides, hee was besot∣ted with the perswasions of regaining the kingdome of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> if hee would still remaine a Catholike: which conceiued hope so stacke in his mind and made
<PB N="42" REF="25"/> so deepe an impression in the bottome of his heart, that of a zealous and earnest professour, hee became key cold, and in the ende proued a bitter enemie to the cause: so that the Guyses did still what they listed, and no redresse was to bee expected, for new Edicts &amp; proclamations were made, &amp; those more seuere then before: such as were knowne or suspected to be Protestants, were appre∣hended, &amp; either forced to recant, or else were burned. This barbarous vsage of so many natural Frenchmen, &amp; outragious crueltie towardes all sorts, bred by little &amp; little a commiseration in the hearts of sundry, in whom there remained some sparks of humanitie, so that banding together &amp; opposing themselues a∣gainst the proceedings of that time, they endeuored by al possible meanes to reforme the common wealth, &amp; reduce the decaied estate to some better order: and albeit that sundrie personages had shewed their liking of a reformation, as the K. of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the conestable, the Admirall, <HI>Dandelot,</HI> &amp; many others, yet no man attempted, but strained courtesie (as it were) who should begin: which procrastinating sundry of good place not beeing able to endure any longer, combined themselues together, hauing for the principall and ringleader of their actions, one called <HI>Godfray de Berry,</HI> Lord of <HI>Renaudy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord of Renaudy with sundry others attēpt against the Guyse.</NOTE> a wise, valiant &amp; wel experienced Gentleman, who notwithstanding wi hout the aduise of six counsellers, and 20. captaines, might not attempt any thing.</P>
<P>This companie consisting of meere polliticks in the beginning, and such as sought for nothing but a reformation in the common weale, were in processe of time assisted by a multitude of those who were tearmed Hugonots (as it is the maner of discontented persons, how different so euer the occasion be, to ioyne rogether in hope of fortunes accidents) who allied themselues with the rest, the more willingly, for that it was in a ciuill cause, and such a thing as tended to the honour of the King, and generall good of the whole state.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur de Renaudy</HI> hauing acquainted many of good account with this great and waightie enterprise, as the Baron <HI>Chastellnaw,</HI> Captaine <HI>Mazeres, Vaillay, Bressay, Chesnay, Chiray,</HI> S. <HI>Mary, Coqueuille, Chateaunef,</HI> and sundrie others, resolued with all possible speed in as close and secret maner as might be, to draw neere the Court, which was then at <HI>Amboyse,</HI> and on the sodaine with some fiue hundred Gentlemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The enter∣prise of the Lord of Re∣naudy disco∣uered.</NOTE> to seise vpon the <HI>Guyse</HI> and the Cardinall of <HI>Lorrain</HI> his Brother, and hauing once caught them to put them to death for an exempla∣rie punishment to all other seducers of the King, and disturbers of the com∣mon wealth. This enterprise could not bee so closely kept but that it came to the eares of the Guyses: who vnderstanding after sundrie examinations, the drift and scope of the whole proiect, and howe that most of those who had complotted together, hadde long since shaken off the Popes yoake, deuised straight to publish so notable a conspiracie, and to make it seeme as odious as might bee to the eyes of all men: they declared howe that they of the refor∣med Religion had conspired against the king, the Queene mother, the kings brethren and Princes of the bloud, &amp; sought to bring in their doctrine by force, to ouerthrow the monarchie of <HI>France,</HI> and to reduce it to a popular estate and gouernement, and by depriuing the king of his crowne, to pull downe the church, to root out the ancient Catholike faith, &amp; to infect the whole land with all kinde of impietie and irreligion, and hauing by sundry proclamations
<PB N="43" REF="25"/> declared the hainousnesse of the fact, fearing that a matter of such consequence was not attempted without the priuitie of some great ones in the land: they for∣tified themselues very strongly, mustered souldiers, gathered forces, and gat all things in a readinesse, to withstand any attempt that should be made vppon the sodaine.</P>
<P>Being thus prouided, they foorthwith apprehended such as they suspected, and proceeded against them with all rigour. Many of them who were taken were executed, and the rest committed to seuerall prisons, sauing some few that by their good fortune escaped their hands. At length diuers of the meaner sort were set at libertie, fearing (indeede) that if all should bee punished, so great seueritie would alienate the hearts of many, who were nothing well affected alreadie. And although that the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the Ad∣mirall nor <HI>Dandelot</HI> could bee charged with the maintaining or abetting of anie of these attempts, yet did the Guyses strongly suspect them, and especially the three Chattillons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The three Chattillons of all other most hated the Guyses.</NOTE> whom of all other they feared most: notwithstanding, they thought it good pollicie to giue them faire speeches for the time, and to enter∣taine them in all plausible maner, vntill they had gotten their forces about them, and had prouided a strong armie in a readinesse: which was no sooner performed, but they began to speake bigge words, and to deale more roughly: and first of all they dealt with the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who was commanded not to depart the Court without licence, while in the meane time they practised to catch matter against him, and to that purpose sundrie with faire promises and re∣wardes were subborned to proue him the cheefe of that seditious tumult at <HI>Amboyse.</HI> They daily whispered in the Kings eare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guyses incense the King against the Prince of Conde.</NOTE> that so long as <HI>Conde</HI> were at libertie, and suffered to countenance such as alreadie were discontented with the present gouernement, the whole land would neuer bee at quiet, nor the kings person in safetie, as appeared by the last rebellious and tumultuous practise. The onely way to preuent so many and so great mischiefes, was to bring the Prince to his answere, and by apprehending the ringleaders, to keep the meaner sort in order and due obedience. Whereupon the king beeing by these sinister informations mightily incensed against the Prince, commaunded <HI>La Trousse,</HI> the steward of his house, to attach sundrie of his seruants and to haue them in safe keeping, and to commaund the prince himselfe to come vnto his presence the next morrow: and to the ende there might be some matter found against him, his house was searched, and all his papers ransacked: the Guyses hadde also sent to search the Chamber and study of the king of <HI>Nauarres</HI> Secre∣tarie, hoping that something would bee founde to minister matter against these great personages: for nowe they might do what they listed, seeing the king approoued whatsoeuer they did, and did speake as it were with theyr tongues.</P>
<P>As soone as the Prince was informed of the kings pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde brought be∣fore the king.</NOTE> he readily obey∣ed, and comming before him, did so cleare himselfe, and answered with such courage and alacritie, that it was thought good to dismisse him for that present, without any further triall: whereupon the king shewed him very good coun∣tenance, and the Guyses seeing the time serued not to accomplish what they had purposed, cloked all in as couert maner as might bee, and each departed
<PB N="44" REF="26"/> from other as good friendes. But the Prince seeing his life was sought for, thought it wisedome to looke to himselfe, and for that long since he fauoured the Gospel, he supposed it to be best to go to his brother the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde lea∣ueth the court and goeth to the King of Na∣uarre.</NOTE> where he should be out of all danger, and might vse his conscience freely. Ma∣ny wondered at this strange dealings with the Princes of the bloud, saying, that if they could not liue without perill of their liues, that it would shortly come to passe, that all true and naturall Frenchmen should bee accounted enemies, and no man bee in securitie but the house of <HI>Guyse</HI> and <HI>Lorrayne,</HI> who being but strangers themselues, durst notwithstanding attempt such practises against the kings best affected subiects, as were in no sort to bee endured. Heereupon great rumors were raised, and infinite multitudes grew greeued with these in∣iurious proceedings.</P>
<P>To preuent the mischiefes that might ensue hereof, the Queene mother with the rest of the Kings councell, sought by amiable letters and smoth words, to content such as most complained, and where they did feare most danger, thi∣ther did they send such as were most gracious with the people, to keepe them in their obedience. The Admirall, who for his wisedome, integritie, and expe∣rience in all politike affaires, was not inferiour to any of that age, was sent in∣to <HI>Normandy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Admi∣rall sent into Normandy to pacifie the Countrey,</NOTE> where there was thought to bee the greatest number of dis∣contented persons, with a straight commaundement to consider of all good meanes, for the quiet of the land, and freely to signifie vnto the court, the occa∣sions of their dislike, and the best way how to reforme those things which were amisse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of the discon∣tentment in France.</NOTE> which he from time to time very faithfully performed, aduertising the Queene mother, that the cruell handling of those of the reformed Religion, and the iniurious dealing with all such as seemed to fauour them, or any waies to countenance them, and that vnder an vnlawfull authoritie, vsurped by stran∣gers, without the approbation of the Princes of the bloud, and the cheefe offi∣cers of the land, and that while the King was in his minoritie, to the great pre∣judice of the Realme and dishonour to the Crowne of <HI>France,</HI> was the cause of so many mischiefes, and was like still to draw on more dangerous consequents, if there were not some speedie course taken to preuent them. Many such aduer∣tisements were sent from all quarters, and sundrie euident signes appeared of ciuill warres. Whereupon it was thought good to assemble all the Princes of the bloud, the Nobilitie, the officers of the Crowne, and all men of place and authoritie, to deuise of the meanes how to pacifie these troubles, which were likely to ensue: which when the Guyses vnderstood, albeit they liked not to heare of the assemblie of the States,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The assembly of the States.</NOTE> and therefore inwardly hated this moti∣on of the Admirall and the Chancellor, from whom it especially proceeded, yet were they outwardly contented therewith, hoping by this meanes to draw the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the conestable and others to the Court, who otherwise could not so easily bee come by, and then to rule them well i∣nough: assuring themselues that the greatest multitude of the Knights of the order, and others of the Nobilitie which should bee there assembled, were at their deuotion, and therefore that nothing could passe in preiudice of them, but rather that all should tende to theyr further profit and aduancement. This reso∣lution beeing taken, sommonances were sent into all quarters, and particular
<PB N="45" REF="26"/> letters written to the king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> to request him to come to the Parliament, which was assigned at <HI>Fountainbleau,</HI> &amp; to bring his brother the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The treche∣rous cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Descari &amp; Bouchart.</NOTE> But when the <HI>Guises</HI> had with more maturitie of iudgement conside∣red of this weightie subiect, fearing that if <HI>Nauarre, Conde,</HI> and the Constable, with all their adherents should meete togither, they should bee ouermatched, and not be able to make their partie good, they practised with <HI>Descars</HI> the Lord Chamberlain, &amp; <HI>Bouchart</HI> the Chancelor, two of <HI>Nauarres</HI> principal seruants, and those indeed vpon whose counsels he principally relied, corrupting them with great summes, and promising them mountaines, if they would vse the means to disswade the K. their master from that assembly. Which two, put so many suspi∣tious matters into <HI>Nauarres</HI> head, and vsed such forceable reasons to diuert him from his intended voiage, that notwithstanding the earnest intreaty of the Con∣stable hee would not bee induced to be at the Parliament at the time appointed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Nauarre would not bee at the councel of estate.</NOTE> which treacherous counsell of theirs, gaue such a blow vnto the whole realm of <HI>France,</HI> that it feeleth the smart therof vntil this day. For <HI>Nauarre</HI> being withhol∣den by this their wicked aduise, the whole gouernement still remained in the hands of the <HI>Guises,</HI> who fortified themselues more and more to their owne ad∣uauncement, and the extreame perill of the whole state.</P>
<P>The day prefixed being come, there presented themselues most the greatest personages which had bin summoned, so that the 21. of August 1559. this hono∣rable cōpanie were assembled in the chamber of the Queene mother, and euery one placed according to their degrees. First the K. vnder his cloth of estate, then the Queene mother, the kings wife, &amp; the kings brethren. Next to these were the Cardinals of <HI>Burben,</HI> of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> of <HI>Guise,</HI> of <HI>Chastillon.</HI> The Dukes of <HI>Guise</HI> and <HI>Aumaile,</HI> duke <HI>Memorancie</HI> Constable of <HI>France, Monsieur d'Hospital</HI> the Chan∣cellor, the two Mareschals, S. <HI>Andrew,</HI> &amp; <HI>Bressac, Chastillon</HI> the Admiral of <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of the estates of France, as they sit in their Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> <HI>Marillac</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Vienna, Morbillier</HI> Bishop of <HI>Orleance: Mouluc</HI> bishop of <HI>Valence, Mortier</HI> and <HI>Auancon,</HI> all of the Kings priuie Councell. The Knights of rhe orders, the masters of the requests, the secretaries, and the rest of the kings officers had likewise their places assigned them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of the estates of France, as they sit in their Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> All things being disposed after this maner, before any were commaunded to speake, the Admirall rose vp, and with a Supplication in his hand went to the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Admi∣rall presen∣teth the sup∣plication of the prote∣stants to the King.</NOTE> to whom (after due obeisance done) hee declared, that according to his Maiesties commandement at his going into Normandie, hauing as diligently as hee could looked into the causes of these troubles which sprung vp dayly in the land, hee in his opinion coniectu∣red, that such as found themselues most greeued, intended no harme against his royall person, or the state, but that their greatest discontentment arose of the ex∣treame persecutions of such, as were termed <HI>Hugonots,</HI> without any iudicial ma∣ner of proceeding: especially seeing they offered to haue their doctrine tried by the scriptures, and were willing to conforme themselues to the order of the pri∣matiue church, &amp; therfore he thought it a thing very agreeable to his maiesties liking, to take their humble petition, and present it vnto his highnesse, to the end that he vnderstanding their grief, might deuise with his councel in so honorable a presence, somespeedy means to relieue his distressed subiects, &amp; to set his king∣dom in some better quietnes, assuring him, that in his opiniō, there were infinit multituds in <HI>France <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI></HI> sighed after a reformatiō, seeing ther were, as he was told,
<PB N="46" REF="27"/> fiftie thousand in <HI>Normandie,</HI> who would willingly haue subscribed vnto that supplication. And so beseeching the King to haue some regarde hereof, and fa∣uourably to enterpret that which he had done, with humble reuerence he re∣turned to his place. When as this supplication was read, &amp; the contents vnder∣stoode, whereof some were that there might bee publike places appointed for the Protestants to meet in, and that their preachers might be permitted to teach the people without perill, many wondred at this bold part of the Admiral, con∣sidering the manifest daunger hee had cast himselfe into, by taking the cause of such odious persons into his hande, and present it vnto the K. who was so exas∣perated agaynst them. The King seemed to take this action of the Admirals in verie good part, giuing him verie gracious wordes, and an honourable te∣stimonie of his good seruice, commanding euery one to speake his opinion in order, and as the case required.</P>
<P>In this assembly there were three which spake excellently to the purpose, lay∣ing open vnto the viewe of all men the naked truth: and as men resolute in their countries cause, not daunted with the faces of any, openly reproued that course which was taken in the administration of the Common-wealth, and the affaires of the land. And those were <HI>Moluc</HI> Bishop of <HI>Valence, Marillac</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and <HI>Chastillon</HI> the Admirall. The eloquent speach of <HI>Mouluc,</HI> did somewhat warme the <HI>Guises,</HI> and <HI>Marillac</HI> with his hardie and learned dis∣courses, did make them as hote as a toast.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mouluc, Marillac, &amp; the Admiral worthy of im∣mortal praise for their free speach.</NOTE> Both concluding, that to preuent so many miseries as were likely to ensue, it were conuenient to assemble a generall Councell: or if that could not be accomplished, then to referre the deciding of those controuersies to a nationall Councell, and in the meane time to deale more mildely with such as were of the reformed religion. But when the Ad∣mirall came to speake, he made them starke mad, hee so touched them to the quicke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Admi∣rall touch the Guises to the quicke.</NOTE> For hauing first approoued that which had beene sayde by <HI>Mouluc,</HI> and <HI>Marillac,</HI> he insisted vpon the new garde which the <HI>Guises</HI> had set about the king which (said he) was a matter of perillous consequence, to nourish the K. in a diffidence and euill opinion of his subiects, and in time might draw on the ha∣tred of the people towards their prince, who seeing themselues suspected, wold be suspitious againe, seeing their king and souereigne armed against them, and in stead of free accesse, to impart vnto him their griefes and doleances, to be vtter∣ly secluded from his presence, by a multitude of armed souldiours. And for his part he could not conceiue what reason there was, why the French king should be so garded: for he would pawne his honour, his goods, yea, and his life to, that there was no harme meant against his person. If any of his principall Offi∣cers were afrayed of themselues, it were good to cut off all occasions of of∣fence, which arose especially of the disordered gouernment of such as had the managing of the publike affayres.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The duke of Guise highly offended with the Admiral.</NOTE>The Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> was in an extreame rage with the Admirall for these spea∣ches, and from that day forward grew to be his mortall enemie. And albeit that hee and the Cardinall his brother, laboured to crosse these good motions be∣fore remembred: yet was it agreed vpon by the King, with the assent of all the Nobilitie, that there should be another assembly of the estates at <HI>Meaux,</HI> and there these points to be more fully resolued of: and in the meane time that euery
<PB N="47" REF="27"/> one should repaire into their Countries, to learne the state of them, the better to acquaint the King at the next assembly with their plaints. While these things were thus in handling, there were many enterprises of the Mal-contents, ten∣ding to the surprising of sundry townes: which occasioned the <HI>Guises</HI> to send out proclamation in the Kings name, and to leuie souldiours, to withstand (as they said) the attempts of the seditious, and perturbers of the state. But the truth was, that hauing their forces in a readinesse, they might send on the sodaine for the Prince of <HI>Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who was still with his brother the King of <HI>Nauarre:</HI> and if hee would not come, then to fetch him by force. But first they assayed after a milde manner, to accomplish their deuises, causing the king to write vnto <HI>Nauarre,</HI> in friendly sort to request him to come to the Court, and to bring his brother <HI>Conde</HI> with him, or otherwise hee shoulde bee compelled to fetch him, for that there were so many, and so euident accusations agaynst him. But <HI>Na∣uarre,</HI> and the Prince aunswered so wisely, and with such courage, that their enemies thought it not good to attempt any thing agaynst them by violence. Whereupon they caused the king to sende an other Messenger, by whome they were required to come to his Maiestie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guises cause the K. to falsifie his worde.</NOTE> assuring them in the worde of a Prince, that there should no iniurie bee offered them, but that they shoulde returne at theyr pleasure: onelie hee desired to bee satisfied from the Prince of <HI>Condees</HI> owne mouth, touching such matters as hee was charged with: Whereupon, these two Princes relying vpon the kings faythfull promises,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1560</NOTE> re∣payred to the Court, whither they were no sooner come, but that the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> was committed to <HI>Chauignie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde cō∣mitted to prison.</NOTE> Captaine of the guarde, and by him clapt vppe in prison, where no man might speake vnto him.

The mother in Lawe likewise of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and Sister to <HI>Chastillon</HI> the Admirall, was sent to prison, and verie narrowlie looked vnto. Her Closet and all her house was ryfled, to find some matter agaynst her. This rough dea∣ling with the chiefe Princes of the blood, and other such of great qualitie and calling, made many muse what would be the issue of such outragious de∣signes.</P>
<P>The Prince had not beene long committed to prison, but there was a priest sent vnto him to say Masse in his Chamber. But hee commaunded him to bee thrust out by the heade and shoulders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince thrusteth a Masse priest out of his doores by the head and shoulders.</NOTE> willing him to tell the King that hee woulde not suffer any such idolatrous seruice in his presence: as also that hee woulde not to saue his life offende the Maiestie of God in so high mea∣sure.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1561"/> <HI><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Rancis</HI> the second was no sooner deceased, and that <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth was come to the Crowne, but all seemed to bee cast in a new mould: especially the state of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> was incontinenly altered: for whereas before hee was accused and condemned of high treason, and should haue beene exe∣cuted, had not the malicious purposes of his enemies beene crossed, by the sudden death of the King: now he was clea∣red of all the former accusations, and declared innocent of those pretended crimes, and restored to his dignitie and place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde set at libertie.</NOTE> The <HI>Guises</HI> his mortall enemies beganne in all submisse maner to seeke his fauour, and neuer left the Queene mother, vntill shee had accomplished theyr desyres: which was the more readilie brought to passe, for that they had caused the late King, a day or two before to speake louingly vnto the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and to affirme that the <HI>Guises</HI> neuer attempted any thing, eyther agaynst him, or his brother, the Prince of <HI>Conde:</HI> but that whatsoeuer was done, was at his commaunde∣ment, and that contrarie to theyr counsaile and aduice, hee had caused the saide Prince to bee imprisoned: and therefore hee desired them, for the loue they bare vnto him, that they woulde not conceyue hardly agaynst them, or anie of theirs.</P>
<P>Albeit <HI>Nauarre</HI> did not beleeue this, yet as one loath to raise new stirs, he was content to temporise &amp; dissemble the matter, supposing in deed, that now their pride was abated, and that they would no more carrie themselues so hautily as they had done in times past. But they no more able to change their natures, then
<PB N="49" REF="28"/> then the Leopard her spots, still aspired to haue the gouernment in their hands: and it seemed the Queene mother was well content to giue them some counte∣naunce, fearing tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if they should bee altogither kept vnder, by the Princes of the blood, her authoritie would likewise in short time be limited: which was a thing that shee could not endure by any meanes. Which being noted by the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> hee complained to the Queene mother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Nauarre complaineth to the Queen mother, of the Guise.</NOTE> that those of <HI>Guise</HI> were againe too much fauored, and that they had too great countenance, being preferred before him, who was the chiefest Prince of the blood, and who by the ancient lawes ought to haue the gouernment of the Realme, during the no∣nage of the King: and that he could not endure to see them aduanced, who had alwayes beene his mortall enemies. And although he were contented to beare much in regard of the loue and dutie he bare vnto her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Princes of the blood depart from the Court greatly dis∣contented.</NOTE> yet there was no reason why his kindnesse should be so hardly requited. And if it were, he woulde not endure it: and further, if the duke of <HI>Guise</HI> were so neare about the King, he must and would be further of.</P>
<P>The Queene mother sought to content <HI>Nauarre</HI> with faire wordes, but yet she did not satisfie him as he desired: and therefore the next day, hee with most of the Princes of the blood, the Conestable, his sonnes and Nephewes of <HI>Chastillon,</HI> departed from the Court towards <HI>Paris,</HI> highly discontented with the Queenes answere. The Queene mother, who extreemely greeued to see this accident, sent for the Conestable to come and speake with her: to whom she caused the King to say, and that in the presence of two Secretaries of estate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cone∣stable com∣manded by the King not to depart from Court.</NOTE> who were readie to recorde what was spoken, that seeing hee was the chiefe Officer of the Crowne, and one of whose presence hee stoode in neede of at that instant, he commanded him not to forsake him, as he would answer it at his perill. Which word tooke such place, and made such an impression in the Conestables minde, that albeit hee were often summoned by the King of <HI>Na∣uarre,</HI> to stand to his promise, yet he could not be drawne from the Court, but kept him stil with the King: wherupon it was presently voiced, that the Queene mother maintained the <HI>Guises</HI> against the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and the rest of the Princes of the blood.</P>
<P>But least <HI>Nauarre</HI> and his associates should bee too much discontented with this crosse dealing, it was thought good to practise some newe attonement betweene them and the <HI>Guises,</HI> and to declare <HI>Nauarre</HI> the kings lieutenant ge∣nerall throughout all his dominions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Nauarre made lieute∣nant generall for the king.</NOTE> which was accomplished by the meanes of the Conestable: so that now <HI>Nauarre</HI> was highly honoured, and the <HI>Guises</HI> made Court vnto him. This gaue some comfort vnto the persecuted <HI>Hugo∣nots,</HI> and caused all men to hope for some better gouernement then had beene of late time: and the rather, for that <HI>Nauarre</HI> tolde the Ambassadour of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> that within one yere he would cause the Gospel to be preached through∣out all <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It was a wonder to heare what ioy there was generally, throughout the whole land, and how exceedingly the number of the Protestants were encrea∣sed in a short tyme, by this little countenaunce which was giuen them. In so∣much as they coulde hardly finde conuenient places to receiue the multitudes, which flocked to the Sermons. Now as there were many who vsed this benefit
<PB N="50" REF="29"/> wisely, and with great reuerence: so there were others, who indiscreetly abu∣sed it, exceeding a meane, and hastily running from one extremitie to another, supposing they stoode vpon a better foundation then indeed they did, began to vse too much libertie, to eate flesh, and that vpon such dayes as were forbidden, to condemne festiuall dayes, and many ceremoniall vsages, to pul downe ima∣ges, and deface altars, contrarie to that which had not long before beene ex∣pressely commaunded: which was that the ordering of these things, should bee referred either to a generall, or nationall councell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Consta∣ble alienated from the Ad∣mirall by the practise of the Guise.</NOTE>This boldnesse and rash dealing of many of the reformed, and the dayly in∣formations of such like pranks played in many corners of the land, brought the Conestable (who was a very deuout and a religious Papist) into a maruellous dislike with such as were tearmed protestants, especially when he saw them at Court eat flesh in Lent, and that there were preachings in the Prince of <HI>Condes</HI> chamber, and likewise in the Admirals, and free accesse for al men to come vnto them. Which when the <HI>Guises</HI> perceiued, they likewise vnder the pretext of re∣ligion ioyned themselues vnto the Conestable, exasperating him agaynst the Admirall his cousin, for his embracing of the Gospel, and set the Mareschal S. <HI>Andrew</HI> to whisper him in the eare, that the motion which was made, as tou∣ching the calling backe againe of those excessiue donations, giuen by the late King, was a deuise of the Admirals, to keepe him being his vncle in awe, and by that practise to cause him to chaunge his Religion. Sundrie others (as Madame <HI>Madalyne de Sauoy</HI> his wife, the Dutchesse of <HI>Valentinois,</HI> &amp; the Count <HI>Villiers,</HI> put to their helping handes to whet him on: who altogither alienated by these practises, notwithstanding all the remonstrances of the Mareschal <HI>Me∣morancie</HI> his sonne, banded against his owne kindred, and associated himselfe with the Dukes of <HI>Montpensier,</HI> and of <HI>Guise,</HI> who with their leagues and confe∣derations robbed the king of his subiects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The league.</NOTE> and brought into that noble kingdom all disorder and confusion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guises</HI> hauing got the Conestable to ioyne with them, began to lift vp theyr heades, and secretly to spread abroade many infamous things agaynst the Admirall, whose confusion of all others they most earnestly desired, where∣vpon many grudgings arose, and it was vehemently feared, that some tumultu∣ous accidents would ensue: for the preuenting whereof, there was an <HI>Edict</HI> made at <HI>Fountainbleau,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Edict made at Fountainbleu</NOTE> and sent abroad into all parts of the land, whereby it was forbidden to vse any opprobrious words to any of the Kings liege people, and especiallie that one shoulde not call another Papist, <MILESTONE N="1561"/> or Hugonot, but that all should liue in amitie togither, and not alter any thing which was alreadie esta∣blished, before the king, by the aduice of his councell, had otherwise ordained. The <HI>Guises</HI> could not endure that this peaceable course should bee taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guises labor to ouer∣throw the kings Edict.</NOTE> and therefore (as those who thought it their best to fish in troubled waters) they de∣uised with the Court of Parliament at <HI>Paris,</HI> to frustrate this Proclamation, and by many reasons to shew the inualiditie therof, &amp; especially for that therby was tollerated two religions: which (said they) was not to be endured, considering that by this meanes, the whole state was endangered, nay that it was impossible for that cōmon wealth to endure long, where there were such cōtrarieties con∣sidering that there can be no agreemēt betwixt god &amp; belial: &amp; a kingdom diui∣ded
<PB N="51" REF="29"/> within it self could not continue for any long time. Besides, the Cardinal of of <HI>Lorrayn</HI> made many greeuous complaints against those of the Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cardi∣nall of Lor∣raine com∣plaineth of the assem∣blies of the Protestants.</NOTE> say∣ing that their assemblies and conuenticles waxed greater euery day then other, that there were foule and villanous disorders committed by them in their noc∣turnall meetings: that they were people without order, without conscience or any ciuill humanitie, and that they neither feared God nor the King.</P>
<P>These and the like complaints much mooued the Queene mother, &amp; gladly she would haue repressed these assemblies, if shee had knowne how. But the countenance of the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the Admirall <HI>Roch∣faucont, Dandelot,</HI> and diuers other of the Nobilitie, did encourage many to per∣sist, and drew on others by their examples, with great earnestnes to embrace the gospel, in so much as at length they finding themselues very strong, and wel countenanced by great estates, seised vppon sundrie of the Catholikes Chur∣ches, and preached publikely in the view of all men, and that in <HI>Paris,</HI> the prin∣cipall Citie of the whole land: yea, the Gospel preuailed so mightily in a short space, that it was founde by the diligent enquirie of the Admirall, that there were 2150. congregations that made profession therof:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2150.</HI> con∣gregations of the prote∣stants in France.</NOTE> which vexed the Guy∣ses to the heart, who by their cunning handling of the matter, had by this time brought the Conestable in such hatred therwith, and with his cousins the three Chastillons, that both hee and the Guyses with all their fauourits, departed the Court in a great chafe, for that they sawe such fauour shewed to the poore Hugonots.</P>
<P>While the Protestants were thus graced at their princes hands, and that all things seemed to go well with them, there fell out a strange accident to crosse that happie course of the Gospel, and a most deuilish pollicie was vsed to ouer∣throw the reformed Religion, well neere established in most of all the princi∣cipall Cities, and cheefest villages of the Realme: and that was this.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> albeit hee fauoured the Religion, and countenanced the professours thereof in very good sort, and that for a good while together: yet beeing a man easily seduced, and almost of no courage or resolution in any thing that hee tooke in hand, was led by others, and by faire words carryed hi∣ther and thither at euerie mans pleasure: which the Guyses and their associats perceiuing, practised sundrie waies to draw him to theyr faction, assuring themselues that if hee might be gained, theyr side would bee strong inough: and that <HI>Conde,</HI> the Admirall, and all the rest of their confederates would bee made to stoope whether they would or not. The better to effect this, they pra∣ctised with the Cardinall of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> the Popes Legat, and with the Cardinall of <HI>Turnon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cardi∣nals of Fer∣rara and Turnon tur∣neth the K. of Nauarre from the Gospel.</NOTE> who hauing by rich gifts, and large promises, gained two of his prin∣cipall seruants, did in the ende likewise win the maister, by a notorious and deep dissimuled deuise. They put into his head a phantasticall conceit, assuring him that if hee would become a Catholike, and continue in the Apostolike Ro∣mane faith, that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> would giue him the kingdome of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> which was foure times so good as <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and that the Popish and Spanish gallies should bee at his commaundement for the defence thereof against all men: some also went about to perswade him to diuorce himselfe from his Wife, and to marrie with the Queene of Scots, a yong, faire, and beautifull
<PB N="52" REF="30"/> widow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Nauarre councelled to deuorce him∣selfe from his Wife, and to marrie with the queene of Scots.</NOTE> the daily soliciting of such as were imployed in this businesse, &amp; their manifolde remonstrances, tooke such place, that his whole mind was set vpon <HI>Sardinia,</HI> whatsoeuer could be saide to the contrarie by any friend he had. The Queene of <HI>Nauarre</HI> vnderstanding this, sought by all meanes to diuert him, setting before his eyes his many and solemne promises both to God and man, and that if hee should now abandon his friendes, all the world would crie out of him. But all was in vaine, for he began to decline euery day more then other, and in short time did vtterly forsake his profession, combining himselfe with the Guyses, his mortall and sworne enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queene mother play∣eth on both hands.</NOTE>The Queene mother did all this while very cunningly carrie her selfe, and became (as it were) a newter betweene both, enclining rather to the Catho∣likes, purposing (in deede) howsoeuer religion went, to take the strongest part, and therfore she entertained the prince of <HI>Conde</HI> &amp; the admiral with faire words, promising them wonders, and for a better shewe countenanced the preachings all that might bee: howbeit, she fauoured the Catholikes in her heart, and be∣gan to make but light of the daily complaints of the protestants.</P>
<P>The league which before had bin made betweene the Conestable, the <HI>Guyse,</HI> and the mareschall Saint <HI>Andrew,</HI> afterwards called the <HI>Triumuirate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trium∣uirate.</NOTE> hauing gained the king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> became very strong, insomuch as they hasted to <HI>Paris,</HI> there to fortifie themselues, and to procure so much as they might, an abolishment of those Edicts and proclamations which had beene published in fauour of the reformed Church. The king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> began to frowne on his cousins of <HI>Chastillon,</HI> and to speake a loofe off vnto them: which made them to forsake the Court, and to retire to their own houses, for feare least there should bee some quarrell picked against them. The prince of <HI>Conde</HI> complayned mar∣uailously of those strange fashions of his brother, and resolutely stood in the fa∣uour of the protestants: and the better to preuent all inconueniences, put him∣selfe within <HI>Paris,</HI> there to prouide for the countenancing of the refourmed Churches, and to see that the Kings edicts should bee executed, and peace maintained so much as might bee.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1562"/> The <HI>Triumuirate</HI> being wel acquainted with all these proceedings, &amp; know∣ing the courage and magnanimous minde of the Prince, which would not bee daunted with words, thought it their best to come strongly appointed, and ei∣ther by faire meanes or by foule to seise vppon the person of the King, and the Queene mother: which if they might once effect, they doubted not but the rest of their deuises would be accomplished well inough.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> desirous to bee with the formost at this audacious enter∣prise, forgot not to ioyne with his associats at the appoynted time, and passing by <HI>Vashy</HI> with a great troupe of armed men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The murther at Vashy by the Duke of Guyse.</NOTE> vnderstanding that there was a Sermon not farre off, where many of the Hugonots were assembled, so∣dainely set vppon them, and in most cruell and outragious sort, put them all to the sword, sparing neither man, woman, nor childe, to the great horror of the beholders of so pittious a tragedy, and to the high dishonor of the King, by whose edict not long before, they were allowed their preachings and liber∣tie of their conscience. After which barbarous fact he hasted to <HI>Paris,</HI> there to effect the rest of his diabolicall deuises. The newes of this horrible murther
<PB N="53" REF="30"/> (being quickly blowne abroad) came no sooner to the eares of the Protestants, but they began to lay their wits together, and to prouide for their safetie. Many of the nobility which had made profession of the gospel, repaired to the prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who was in <HI>Paris,</HI> there to take aduise what course were best to be v∣sed in so perilous &amp; dangerous times: where it was concluded, that before they would rise in armes, they would first seeke for iustice by the ordinary course ap∣pointed: whereupon they complained to the King, the Queene mother, and the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> desiring that the Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prince of Conde as∣keth for iu∣stice against the Guise, but cannot be heard.</NOTE> who was now vp in armes and marching towards <HI>Paris,</HI> might bee commanded to come in more peacea∣ble manner, and to answere those greeuous complaints made against him, and his contemptuous and disobedient proceedings against the Kings lawes. The Queen mother seemed to hearken vnto them, but the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> flatly an∣swered, that hee which touched the little finger of the Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> touched his whole body, and that hee would not endure that he should be wronged by any.</P>
<P>By this time was the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> come to <HI>Paris,</HI> accompanied with the Conestable, the Duke of <HI>Aumaile,</HI> the mareschall of Saint <HI>Andrew, Randan,</HI> and with a great troupe of other his associats, where he was receiued with the ac∣clamations of sundrie other his supposts, <HI>Viue Guyse, Viue Guyse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guyse receiued with great accla∣mations into Paris.</NOTE> as if the K. him∣selfe had entred. There likewise repaired to the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> great numbers of his friendes and followers: so that the Citie was full of armed men, diuided into two contrarie factions. The Cittizens fearing that there would bee some vprore, and that some dangerous accident would ensue among so many ene∣mies and discontented persons, besought the Prince, that for the loue and fauor which they had alwaies borne to the Princes of the bloud, and in especiall to the house of <HI>Conde,</HI> it would please him to haue compassion vppon the Pa∣risians, who now stood in great feare of their liues and losse of their goods, if a∣ny tumultuous stirre should happe, by reason their Citie swarmed with a mul∣titude of souldiers, whom they knewe not how to bee ridde of, vnlesse it might please him whom they had alwaies knowne to bee of a very milde and peacea∣ble nature, to withdrawe himselfe and his troupes to some other place: which course as they were assured, it would bee the safest for theyr Citie, so they doubted not but it would be most honourable vnto him, and an euident argu∣ment vnto all the worlde, of the religious care hee had to saue so many mens liues, as at that instant seemed to be in assured perill.</P>
<P>Whereto the Prince answered, that hee for his part was very willing to leaue the Cittie, if the <HI>Guyse</HI> would do the like: which thing beeing promised that it shuld be performed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The prince of Conde lea∣uing Paris at the request of the Parisiās, the Guyse seiseth vpon it</NOTE> the prince was no sooner departed, but there were strong guards sette at the gates to keepe him from reentring: and so was the Prince ex∣pelled, and the <HI>Guyse</HI> remained maister of the Citie: This beeing brought to passe, the <HI>Triumuirate</HI> presently marched towards the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trium∣uirate seiseth vpon the K.</NOTE> and there tooke the king, the Queene mother, and the Kings brethren, whome they brought to <HI>Paris,</HI> and forthwith determined to proclaime wars against the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin∣ning of the first ciuill warres.</NOTE> and all his associats. The Prince beeing enformed of these proceedings, sent <HI>Dandelot</HI> brother to the Admirall, to seise vppon <HI>Orleance,</HI> which (though with some difficultie) hee accomplished: whether <HI>Conde</HI> foorthwith repaired, and
<PB N="54" REF="31"/> tooke possession of the Towne to the kings vse. <MILESTONE N="1562"/> Now was the warre open on all sides, and the Reformed persecuted in most cruell maner in euery place, e∣specially at <HI>Paris,</HI> where nothing was more common then murthering, spoiling, and pilling the poore Hugonots: yea, such was the rage of the barbarous Ca∣tholikes, that the Princesse of <HI>Cōde</HI> passing through a village called <HI>Vaudray,</HI> was set vpon beeing in her Coach and great with childe, and by hurling and throw∣ing of stones by sundrie of the townesmen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prin∣cesse of Conde assailed in hir Coach by the Papists.</NOTE> at the instigation of a popish priest, put in hazard of her life, wherewith shee was so terrified, that shee was deliue∣red before her time of two twins shortly after, and at length with much adoo, arriued at <HI>Orleance</HI> with her eldest sonne the marquesse of <HI>Conty:</HI> where shee found the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the Admirall, <HI>Dandelot,</HI> and many other principall persons of the Religion, who were busied in gathering forces, and prouiding al necessarie meanes to withstande their enemies. There were letters written to the Emperour <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> and the Princes of the Empire, enforming them of the occasion of their bearing of armes, and of the vsurped authoritie of the Guyses and their adherents, earnestly beseeching them to haue some commise∣ration of the King, who being a Child, was held in captiuitie by their tyranny, and al things likely to be brought to a woful desolation throughout the realme of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince had no sooner gathered a great power about him, &amp; was growne strong by reason of a supply brought vnto him out of <HI>Poictou,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conde ta∣keth certaine townes vpon the Loyre.</NOTE> and <HI>Xantoigne,</HI> of three or foure hundred horse, by the count <HI>Rochfaucont,</HI> but that it was thought best to be doing, and to employ some of his forces in getting of certaine strong townes and other well fortified places neere adioyning: and thereupon certain troups were sent downe along by the Riuer of <HI>Loyre,</HI> who tooke <HI>Mun, Baugen∣cy,</HI> and others, wherein they placed certaine garrisons, to keepe them from bee∣ing regained by the enemie, who now sought continually to anoy the Prince, and to take the aduantage that was offered.</P>
<P>Sundrie Cities in <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Angiers, Tholous, Lymoux,</HI> with many others, wher∣in there were thousands of the reformed Religion, seeing that the Prince was growne strong, and very able to confront his enemies, began to shewe them∣selues openly, and to stande with the rest of their confederates: whereuppon foorthwith there ensued a mortall hatred betweene them and the Catholikes, each seeking the ouerthrow of others by all possible meanes. Then immediatly followed robbing, spoyling, rauishing, murthering, &amp; massacring, in most out∣ragious maner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The misery of the ciuill warres.</NOTE> with a maruailous confusion in euery corner of the Land. No man could well tell whom to trust, or where to dwell in safetie. The cheefe Ci∣ties were fraught with garrisons, the small villages were sacked and burned by such as cared neither for God nor the deuill, but onely howe to enrich them∣selues. Infinite were the miseries in all quarters, and nothing almost heard of but weeping, wailing, and lamentation, and no hope of any redresse of so in∣comprehensible mischiefes.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> and his associats pondering in their minds the wofull de∣solation that was like to ensue, if there were not some present remedy for these diabolicall proceedings, wrote diuers letters to the King, the Queene mother, and the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> beseeching them to take some commiseration vppon
<PB N="55" REF="31"/> the poore and desolate people, and that by suffering the subiect to vse his con∣science so long as he liued in obedience and according to the kings Edict, <HI>France</HI> might enioy her former peace, and not be brought to that horrible desolation, which doth inseparably accompanie ciuill and intestine warres▪ but the <HI>Guyse</HI> (who in deede with the Cardinall his brother ruled the rost) could not endure to heare of any peace, but daily and hourely cryed out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Guyse cri∣eth out for war.</NOTE> to muster men, to ga∣ther souldiers, to send for the kings bannes and arierbannes, and with fire and sword to persecute the poore protestants. And hauing by their damnable prac∣tises gotten an armie, marched towards <HI>Orleance</HI> with great furie. The confede∣rates beeing daily aduertised by their espials of the approch of the Catholikes, thought it best to meete them by the way, and if oportunitie serued, to giue them battaile, being especially mooued thereunto by the continuall perswasi∣ons of the Admirall, and the couragious resolution of all in generall.</P>
<P>Wherupon the prince tooke the field the nineteenth of <HI>Iune,</HI> 1562. with three Regiments of footmen, amounting to the number of 33. Ensignes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde ta∣keth the field.</NOTE> whose Col∣lonels were <HI>Gnamont, Fontenay,</HI> the yongest sonne of the vicont of <HI>Roham,</HI> and <HI>I∣uoy</HI> brother to <HI>Genlis,</HI> with two thousand horse encamped at <HI>Vausoudun,</HI> neere vnto <HI>Orleance,</HI> and directly in the way towardes <HI>Baugency.</HI> The Catholikes ha∣uing not as yet al their forces in a readinesse, thought it best to amuse the Prince with a parle of peace, in which action the Queene mother was thought the meetest to be employed: who so handled the matter, that the Protestants (who longed after nothing so much as quietnesse) were readily drawne to hearken thereto: onely they required, that before any thing was talked of, the Conesta∣ble, the Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> and the marquesse Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> should withdraw them∣selues to their houses, and then the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> should come to the King to treate of that, which especially tended to the peaceable state of the common wealth, and the welfare of euery particular man.</P>
<P>This was no sooner mooued by the Protestants, but it was accepted by the Queene mother, so that immediatly those three principall Catholikes departed from the Court, and went as farre as <HI>Chasteaudan,</HI> where they stayed to expect the sequell of their secret councels. The Prince vnderstanding of theyr depar∣ture, went presently vnto the K. putting himself into the hands of the Queene mother, and other his enemies:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conde put∣teth himselfe into the hands of his enemies.</NOTE> but he was no sooner come to the Court, but he forthwith repented of his haste, and beeing aduertised by sundry, of his immi∣nent perill and danger, pollitikely obtained of the Queen mother, that the prin∣cipall men of his Armie might likewise come to knowe her further pleasure: which beeing granted, hee wrote a secret letter vnto them of his estate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A polliticke deuise of the Prince.</NOTE> desiring them to hasten, and to come strongly accompanied.</P>
<P>The next day early in the morning there came the Admirall, <HI>Dandelot, Roch∣faucont,</HI> the Prince <HI>Portian, Rohan, Genlis, Gramont, Soubize, Piennes,</HI> and many o∣ther lords &amp; Captains, with a far greater retinew then the Queen expected: so that nowe she thought it best to make fayre weather, and to sooth them vp, considering (in deed) that shee was not able to detayne the Prince any longer then hee himselfe listed, and therefore in very gracious maner shee bad them al welcome, and openly in the presence of all the Nobilitie, shee gaue them great thanks, for their true and faithfull seruice towardes the king, assuring them
<PB N="56" REF="32"/> that shee (for her parte) did thinke very honourably of all their proceedings, and did not doubt but the King her sonne would bee mindfull hereafter to re∣compence so many deserts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queene mother al∣loweth of the proceedings of the prote∣stants.</NOTE> seeing it was very apparant that both his estate and her owne was maintained by their royall seruices.

<P>They further declared vnto the Queen mother, the manifold greeuances of the kings subiects, with a meanes to remedie so many &amp; so lamentable disor∣ders, to al which &amp; sundry other remonstrances, albeit she seemed to giue some allowances, yet for that shee stood so stiffly against the free exercise of Religi∣on, and would needes vrge the Prince to depart the Realme (as indeed he had promised, rather then hee would bee any occasion of the continuance of ciuill wars, albeit presently vppon better and more mature consideration hee repen∣ted him of the speech) there could bee nothing concluded. Whereupon the Prince returned to his campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde re∣turneth to his Campe &amp; prepareth for warre.</NOTE> exceeding glad that God had deliuered him out of the snares of his enemies, and resolued with all, for his forces to fight it out, and to hazard his fortune assoone as any oportunitie was offered. With this re∣solution he dislodged and marched towards the Catholikes, hauing in his army ten thousand fiue hundred footmen, and a thousand horse. Now when he ap∣proched the enemie, hauing disposed his troupes in very warlike maner, he twice presented the battaile, but the Catholikes refused,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Catho∣likes refuse to fight.</NOTE> for that all their forces were not as yet assembled.</P>
<P>The Prince seeing hee could not drawe them out of their strength, hauing braued them in the faces, and maintained some light skirmishes with them, re∣tired towardes <HI>Orleance,</HI> sending abroad into all quarters to prouide all neces∣saries for the warres: and for the more speedy accomplishment heereof, it was decreed that <HI>Soubize</HI> shoulde bee sent to <HI>Lyons, Rochfaucont</HI> into <HI>Xaintoigne, Duras</HI> into <HI>Guyen,</HI> and <HI>Briquemault</HI> into <HI>Normandy,</HI> and so into <HI>England,</HI> to procure both men and money, and as many friendes as might be gotten. <HI>Dande∣lot</HI> was likewise sent into <HI>Germany,</HI> to hasten such succours as were promised by the Princes Protestants. <HI>Conde,</HI> and the Admirall, with the rest of the Cap∣taines and Gentlemen, with two and twenty ensignes of footmen remained stil in <HI>Orleance.</HI></P>
<P>By this time were the forces which came out of <HI>Germany</HI> to the aide of the Catholikes in a readinesse to march vnder their Collonelles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forces sent out of Ger∣many to aide the Catho∣likes.</NOTE> <HI>Rokendolf, Frewlich,</HI> and the <HI>Ringraue,</HI> who besides certaine Cornets of Reisters, had likewise twen∣tie ensignes of Lansquenits.

<P>The Catholikes were long in suspence whether they should besiege <HI>Or∣leance,</HI> or <HI>Rohan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Catho∣likes besiege Rohan, and take it.</NOTE> the principall Citie in <HI>Normandie:</HI> but at last, they resolued to as∣say their forces agaynst <HI>Rohan.</HI> Where hauing first gayned the fort of Saint <HI>Ka∣therins,</HI> which commaunded the towne, through the treacherie of the captaine, who was corrupted with money and faire promises, they foorthwith entred by force, killing, spoyling and murthering the inhabitants in most cruell and hor∣rible manner, and making hauocke of all thinges without pittie or mer∣cie. <HI>Augustine Marolat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marlorat hanged.</NOTE> a famous learned man, and chiefe Minister of the Towne, was there hanged, with <HI>Mautreuill</HI> the president of the Par∣liament, besides sundrie other of speciall account. The Catholikes lost manie of theyr brauest men: and amongst others the King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> who beeing shot with a Harquebuz in the left shoulder, as hee was making water in the Trenches, dyed the seuenteenth of September following:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Nauarre wounded to death.</NOTE> neuer attaining that Marittime Kingdome, the hope whereof had so bewitched him, that he forgat wife, children, kinsfolks, friends, Religion, yea, and God himselfe, and thought of nothing but of the <HI>Sardinian</HI> Crowne: beeing happie in nothing but in this, that hee dyed in the beginning of the Ciuill warres, and neuer lyued to see the miserie of his owne Countrey, whereof hee had beene a chiefe and principall cause.</P>
<P>The losse of this Citie being a place of so great importance, was a maruailous discouragement vnto many, who stood but faintly to their tacklings before, and had (no doubt) wrought a more daungerous effect, had not this breach beene repayred, or at least well amended, by the surpassing care and prouident cir∣cumspectnesse of <HI>Dandelot,</HI> who so plied his friends in <HI>Germany,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dandelot bringeth for∣ces out of Germany to the ayd of the Protestants,</NOTE> that he had ga∣thered about 3300. horse, and 4000. footmen, with whom there met the Prince <HI>Portion</HI> at <HI>Strausbourge</HI> with 100. French horse. The ioiful news of which power encouraged the confederates to hold out, in hope of their future help, and mar∣uellously animated such, as before were exceedingly daunted with the remem∣brance of their former losses. These new supplies marched towards <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and passing ouer the riuer of <HI>Seine,</HI> trauersed the country by <HI>Yonne, Creuen,</HI> &amp; <HI>Mon∣targis,</HI> and arriued at <HI>Orleance,</HI> in despite both of the duke of <HI>Neuers,</HI> and the Ma∣reschall S. <HI>Andrew,</HI> who were sent to stop their passage, with 14. cōpanies of men of Armes, 16. cornets of Argoletters, 25. ensignes of footmen, 9. companies of launces, and 13. of light horse, besides the old troupes of <HI>Picardie,</HI> vnder the lea∣ding of <HI>Pauan, Monsales, Giury, Crenay,</HI> and many other Chieftaines. This noble and valiant <HI>Dandelot,</HI> gayned a verie honourable report, euen of his enemies, for so wise and politique a conduct, insomuch as hee was not onely reputed a Gentleman of surpassing courage, and of an vndaunted spirit in greatest pe∣rils, but also a leader of excellent skill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dandelot esteemed for an excellent captaine</NOTE> and deepe foresight to preuent all daun∣gers: About the same instant there met with him also <HI>Rochfaucont,</HI> and <HI>Duras,</HI> with some three hundred horse, and a thousand fiue hundred footmen, al which were no sooner assembled at <HI>Orleance,</HI> but that the Prince determined to take the field: and hauing prouided all thinges in a readinesse, departed towarde <HI>Phiuiers,</HI> and so to <HI>Baugencie▪</HI> both which places were quickelye gayned
<PB N="58" REF="33"/> from the Catholikes, with the strong Towne of <HI>Estamps:</HI> where was founde great store of prouision, as Corne, Wine, Powder, shot, and all necessaries for the warres.</P>
<P>The Prince after some smal stay to repose his wearied troups, marched on to∣wards <HI>Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde marcheth to∣wards Paris.</NOTE> which he no sooner approched, &amp; that the bands vnder the leading of the <HI>P. Portian,</HI> and <HI>Mouy,</HI> had giuen in so farre as the suburbs of <HI>S. Victor,</HI> but that all the Citie was in an vprore, and euery man at their wittes ende: so won∣derfully were they daunted with the sight of the Princes armie, albeit they were not past eight thousande footemen, and some fiue or sixe thousande horse. Whereas there were within the Citie at the least, a hundred thousand able to beare armes, hauing the Constable, the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Neuers,</HI> the Mareschals, and in a manner all the braue leaders of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> for their chief∣taines and commaunders. But such was their timorousnesse, that they kept themselues close, albeit the battell was presented vnto them twise at the least, and onelie amused the Prince with certaine conditions of peace, about the which there were manie meetings. In the end all being found to be but meere delayes, and onelie to gaine time, vntill the comming of the Spaniardes, the Prince resolued to assaile the enemie in his Trenches: but the same night, which was appoynted for this exployte, and immediately before it shoulde haue beene put in execution, <HI>Genlis</HI> a principall man among the Protestants, secretely fledde to the Catholikes: which vnexpected accident quite altered the councell of the Confederates, supposing that now there was some aduer∣tisement giuen of their intended enterprise:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genlis flieth to the Ca∣tholikes</NOTE> and therefore they deferred the execution of that proiect, vntill some other tyme. But by reason of the wants that were in the Armie, as the penurie of victuals, and other necessaries, as also a secrete discontentment among the straungers, for that they lacked theyr pay, it was agreed to stay no longer before <HI>Paris,</HI> which was not so easie to bee gotten, nor in so short a tyme, as was requisite to supplie theyr pre∣sent necessitie, but to dislodge and to retire towards <HI>New-hauen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prince leaueth Paris and mar∣cheth to∣towards New hauen.</NOTE> there to attende such succours as were expected out of <HI>England.</HI> By the way the Prince tooke <HI>Galardon,</HI> a towne of good importance, where he stayed to giue some breath to his wearyed troups, and to accommodate his armie of such things as were most necessarie.</P>
<P>The Catholikes coasted him all the way watching to catch him at some ad∣uantage: howbeit nothing was attempted vntill both the camps were come vn∣to <HI>Dreux,</HI> where they approched so neare, and either partie had so farre engaged themselues, that there was no remedie, but they must needes fight: so that now each Generall began to bethinke of all good meanes for the strengthening of himselfe, and the weakening of his enemyes. The Catholikes had made choyse of a verie strong place to encampe in, beeing neare vnto <HI>Dreux,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The battel of Dreux,</NOTE> wherein there was a garrison of their associates, and likewise adioyning vnto a wood, which was a verie fit and conuenient place, to effect diuers stratagems. There was a large and spacious plaine, through which there ran a little valley, seruing as it were for the bounds and limits of both armies. The Constable hauing got∣ten this aduauntage, presented himselfe in battell aray, at the head of the vil∣lage, vppon the toppe of a little hill, hauing placed two strong battaylons
<PB N="59" REF="33"/> of footemen in the towne, which should gard fourteene Cannons: so planted, that they were ready to play vpon the army of the confederates, as soone as the signall should be giuen. Each battaillon was flanked with certaine troupes of horse, as it were for a mutuall succour one for another, with their <HI>Enfans perdus</HI> in their fronts, and those of the choysest of all their regiments. They had the Ri∣uer <HI>Eureux</HI> at their backes, and espying that they were likely to come to a triall of their fortune, they forthwith emparked themselues betweene two villages, in a place of more aduantage then before.</P>
<P>The Mareschall S. <HI>Andrew</HI> led the auauntgard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Catho∣like armie.</NOTE> which was composed of nine companies of French launces, thirteene ensignes of Spaniards, with as manie French, and eleuen of Almaines, with foure field peeces: all which were aran∣ged on the left side of the Conestable, who led the maine battaile, further aduaunced then eyther the Mareschall, or the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> wherein were seuenteene Cornets of men of Armes, and three of light horsmen, with two and twentie ensignes of Zwitzers, seuenteene of French and Britons, and eyght peeces of great Ordinance. The Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> led the rerewarde, which seemed to flanke the battaile of the Conestable on the right side, with a strong troupe of horsemen, and two esquadrons of Spanish footemen, with sundrie others his followers, men of especiall account, and much renowmed for their valy∣antnesse.</P>
<P>The prince had so araunged his battailes, that the horsemen wherein they ouermatched his enemies, were in the formost rankes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prote∣stants armie</NOTE> and taking vnto himselfe <HI>Rochfaucont,</HI> with certaine light horsemen of <HI>Guries</HI> companie, with some other Cornets led by <HI>Mouy,</HI> and <HI>Auarell,</HI> besides a troupe of Reisters, all which serued as flankers for his battailon of footmen, resolued to encounter the Conestable, who seemed to be readie to giue the charge.</P>
<P>Each generall hauing disposed of all things in this warlike sort, the great artil∣larie began to vomit out their deuilrie, and the Conestable prepared to assaile the battaile of the Prince, which hasted in like maner to the encounter, and that with so stately and superbious a dismarch, that it gaue euident testimonie, that it was led by a generall of noble courage, and great experience. The Prince charged the Zwitzers, who valiantly endured the first shotte, and stoode to it verie manfully.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde charge the Switzers, &amp; ouerthroweth them.</NOTE> But at length by reason of the smal shot which hailed vpon them without ceasing, and somwhat cleared their ranks, they began to giue ground, which the valiant and couragious <HI>Mouy</HI> espying, incorporating his troups with <HI>Monsieur de Daneret,</HI> set on them with such furie, that he made them flie amaine. And being seconded by the Prince, wholy defeated them, as renowmed Pyke∣men as they were. The Reisters, who followed the Princes good fortune, gaue in with great courage, committing a maruellous carnage and mortalitie vpon their enemies. At the same instant the Admirall charged the Conestable, and that so lustily, that his men began to shrinke, and he himselfe being wounded in the face with a Curtelas, and sore bruised with small pistoll shot, was forced to yeeld to <HI>Vezines.</HI> But the Reisters passing by at that instant, tooke him away by force, and carryed him to the Prince, as a prisoner of their owne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cone∣stable taken prisoner.</NOTE> The rest of the Co∣nestables battaile was quickely defeated, and no hope left for the Catholikes, had not the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> reserued his forces, whole and entyre, and with a
<PB N="60" REF="34"/> sudden charge crossed the happy course of the victorious Prince: whose battail∣lons of footmen being bared of their horse, could not endure the furious assault of the Guisards, but fled as fast as they could to saue their liues: notwithstanding all the encouragement vsed by <HI>Dandelot,</HI> who perswaded them all that he might to abide their enemies.</P>
<P>Moreouer <HI>Danuille</HI> one of the sonnes of the Constable, espying the princes horsmen disordered with pursuing their victory, charged thē before they could be rallied afresh, and hauing first wounded <HI>Conde</HI> in the hand, and then slain his horse, the red crosses so pressed on him on all sides, before he could be remoun∣ted, that he was constrained to yeeld himself prisoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conde taken prisoner.</NOTE> to the immeasurable grief of all the confederates. The Admirall gathering togither so manie as possible he might, of his dispersed troupes, gaue a fresh charge vppon the <HI>Guise,</HI> where there was a sore and cruell fight: but for that he was not able to match his ene∣mies, after the death of many braue men on both sides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dinothus saith, that there were <HI>10000.</HI> Ca∣tholikes slaine The Ma∣reschal S.

The Duke of <HI>Aumaile</HI> was greeuously hurt, and likewise the Duke of <HI>Neuers,</HI> who dyed shortly after. The principall prisoners which were taken, were the Constable, who was forthwith sent to <HI>Orlean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> with <HI>Orayson, Rochfort, Esclauoles,</HI> and sundrie other Gentlemen of good account. <MILESTONE N="1563"/> There were slain on the Princes side verie neare a thousand fiue hundred footmen, seuen hundred Almains, &amp; some foure hun∣dred horse, as <HI>Dinothus</HI> reporteth. The principall of which were, the Baron of <HI>Arpaion, Saux, Shandeu, Liencourt, Fredomere, Carliere, Rongnac, Mazelles, Saint Ger∣mier,</HI> al which for the most part were of the Cornet of <HI>Mouy,</HI> who was taken pri∣soner at this last conflict.</P>
<P>The newes of this battaile was verie vncertaine: each side supposing, yea, and constantly reporting their owne ouerthrowe. But vpon more certaine intelligence, how that both Generals were taken, and that they had parted in a maner with equall losse, each faction beganne to rowse vp themselues, and to hope for better successe in their future wars: wherupon they resolued to choose them new Generals, vntill the old were againe restored to libertie. The duke of <HI>Guise</HI> was thought the meetest to commaund ouer the Catholikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The D. of Guise chosen generall ouer the Catho∣liks, and the Admirall ouer the pro∣testants.</NOTE> and the Ad∣mirall ouer the confederates, who pondering their harmes lately receiued by the death of so many braue men, and their want of many necessaries requisit for to keepe the field, thought it best to retire, the one to <HI>Paris,</HI> the other to <HI>Orleance,</HI> and there to repaire their broken armies.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> lay not long idle, but assayed to recouer certaine townes from the Confederates, as <HI>Pluuiers, Estamps,</HI> and some others. The Admirall on the other side, beeing as carefull to maintaine heade agaynst the enemie, be∣sieged <HI>Selles</HI> in <HI>Berry,</HI> which was yeelded vpon composition: where he found good store of gold and siluer for the payment of his Reisters. <HI>Rochfaucont</HI> tooke S. <HI>Agnan:</HI> and the Prince <HI>Portian,</HI> entered <HI>Monrichard.</HI> The gayning of which Townes greatly countenanced the wauering estate of the Protestants. Thus did these two armyes flote vp and downe, each seeking to encroach vppon other so much as might bee. At length the Admirall espying the drift
<PB N="61" REF="34"/> of the <HI>Guise,</HI> which was to inuest <HI>Orleance</HI> on the sudden, put himself with all his forces within the Citie. Where notwithstanding vpon better aduice, he remay∣ned not long, but marched towards <HI>Normandie,</HI> to meet with the Englishmen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The admiral goeth to∣wards New-hauen, to meete with the English∣men.</NOTE> whose landing was dayly expected at <HI>New-hauen,</HI> which was the place appoin- for that purpose, and that by the consent of the confederates.</P>
<P>The Queene mother being aduertised hereof, laboured to stop his inten∣ded voyage, by propounding a parle of peace: but the Admirall being well ac∣quainted with such stratagems, would in no wise hearken thereto, but folo∣wed his formed proiect, and so with some 3000. horse passingly well furnished, and far better then at the battel of <HI>Dreux,</HI> held on his course. And being a man of great experience, and singular expedition in all his enterprises, he surprised on the sudden sundry places, which proued afterward of no small moment, for the aduancing of the affaires of the confederates.</P>
<P>The duke of <HI>Guise</HI> hauing his armie in a readinesse, and vnderstanding of the Admirals departure from <HI>Orleance,</HI> leauing <HI>Dandelot</HI> his brother for the guarde therof, vntill his returne, thought it best to besiege them who were there assem∣bled, while the Admirall with the flower of all their troupes was busied other wheres. With this resolution he dislodged, and planted his siege about the towne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Guise be∣sieheth Or∣leance.</NOTE> which he so sore battered, and couragiously assailed, that the Citie was in imminent perill, and all the confederates were in a wonderfull feare, least it should haue beene taken. Yea, the Duke so assured himselfe thereof, that hee wrote to the King and Queene Mother, that he hoped now to extirpe the race of the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> who had for so many yeares troubled the whole land, and that he would send them newes therof within foure and twentie houres. But while he was thus in his ruffe, firmely perswading himselfe that all was his, bebold, there fell out a straunge and vnexpected accident, which brake the necke of all his deuises.</P>
<P>There was a poore Gentleman named <HI>Iohn Poltrot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The storie of Poltot that killed the Duke of Guise.</NOTE> one of verie little sta∣ture, but full of spirite and lyfe, and generally reputed of such as best knewe him, to bee somewhat a rash headed fellow, and verie vndiscreete, and one that durst attempt any thing. Who being brought vp for a long time in <HI>Spaine,</HI> had learned the language verie perfectly: And for that both for his colour, complection, and stature, he was so like vnto them of that nation, he was com∣monly called the little Spaniard.</P>
<P>This fellow seruing sometime vnder <HI>Soubize,</HI> who commaunded at <HI>Lyons,</HI> woulde often vaunt, that this was the hande (stretching out his arme) that shoulde kill the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> and deliuer <HI>Fraunce</HI> from that monstrous and cruell Tyrant. And this hee vsually vttered in great brauerie: so that as manie as heard him, knowing the humour of the man, laughed at his fol∣lie, little imagining that hee meant as hee sayde, for if hee had, then it was lykely hee woulde haue kept his purpose more secrete, and not haue beene so open mouthed. It happened so, that immediately after the bat∣taile of <HI>Dreux, Soubize</HI> sent this <HI>Poltrot</HI> with a Letter to the Admirall, who was nowe at <HI>Selles</HI> in <HI>Berrie:</HI> whither hee was no sooner come, but that <HI>Feuquieres,</HI> whome hee had serued in former tymes in the warres in <HI>Py∣cardie,</HI> knowing him to bee a man of seruice, commended him to the
<PB N="62" REF="35"/> Admirall, saying: that he was a fit man to bee employed to discouer somewhat of the enemyes proceedings about <HI>Orlean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> for that he shoulde bee taken for a Spaniard, and so a fauourer of theyr designes. Wherupon the Admirall gaue him twentie Crownes, and sent him to <HI>Orleance:</HI> where hee conti∣nued not long, but hauing got as good intelligence as he coulde, returned backe to do his message.</P>
<P>The Admyrall lyking the man well for his diligence, and secrecie in mat∣ters of such importaunce, gaue him an hundred Crownes, and bidde him buy him a good Horse, that hee might with more celeritie dispatch his busi∣nesse. With this money <HI>Poltrot</HI> bought him a verie excellent Spanish Genet, and leauing the Admirall, went backe to the <HI>Guises</HI> Campe, where he away∣ted some oportunitie to put in execution his intended purpose. Which short∣ly after fell out: for hee espying the Duke somewhat late in the euening ry∣ding towardes his Tent vppon a little Nagge, onely attended on by a Gen∣tleman Vsher which went before him, and an other which talked with him: hee approched as neare as hee could, and discharged his pistoll vpon the Duke, hitting him in the shoulder, wounded him verie sore, and so turning his horse, fled as fast as he could. And hauing ridden all that night by by-wayes, for feare of those who pursued him, he not knowing which way he went, wandred vp and downe, &amp; in the end came againe almost to the place where hee committed the fact. Which when he perceiued, he rode all the day folowing, with as much speed as possibly might be, to get out of the danger of his pursuing enemies. But hauing with continuall trauell wearied both himselfe and his horse, he rested at a farm house, where he was taken vpon suspition, and committed to safe keeping for his further triall. Being examined, and found culpable, he was adiudged to be drawn in peeces with foure horses:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poltrot drawne in peeces with horses.</NOTE> to haue his head cut off, and his torne bo∣die to be burnt to ashes.</P>
<P>This sudden blow did maruellously dismay the Catholikes, and the rather for that it appeared to be deadly, and not possible to be healed: For he waxed worse euerie day then other, and died very shortly after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Guise died within seuen or eight daies after his hurt</NOTE> to their vnspeakable greefe: who had reposed their whole confidence in him, and to the great reioycing of the confederates, whose deadly &amp; sworne enemies he was alwayes accounted. And this was the end of that turbulent spirit, &amp; ambitious <HI>Guise,</HI> who as he had massacred many: so he in the end was murthered by others, and that euen then when he thought least of any danger: nay rather fully perswaded himselfe well neare to haue attained to the full period of his wished desires. So vncertaine is the state and condition of the greatest, and most mightie personages in this vari∣able and changeable world.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guise</HI> was no sooner dead, but there ensued a present alteration: and those conditions which had beene before propounded, were forthwith fully agreed vpon, &amp; so was there a peace proclaimed the 19. of March folowing at S. <HI>Memen,</HI> in the campe before <HI>Orleance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace pro∣clamed in the Campe before Orleance.</NOTE> wherewith all sorts in generall seemed to bee mar∣uellously well contented, hoping to be freed frō those horrible miseries, wher∣with they had bin afflicted for so many yeres. And indeed albeit this pacification held but for a while, yet did the whole land reape great fruite thereby, and ac∣knowledged the gracious goodnesse of the Almightie, in that it had pleased
<PB N="63" REF="35"/> him to giue them some respite, and to make an end of their Ciuill warres. But this blessed peace could not continue long, by reason there fell out many occa∣sions of discontentment to either faction, by meanes wherof they were soone entangled afresh in their former sorrowes and vexations.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Cardinall of <HI>Lorraine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cardi∣nall of Lor∣raine seeketh new occasions of strife.</NOTE> and brother to the deceased Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> the especiall instrument of all these calamities which hadde continued for so long time in that noble kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> inwardly vexed to see such a peaceable estate, know∣ing full well that it did not stande with his commoditie and profit, to see the Princes of the bloud to bee fauoured at the Court, neither yet the Nobilitie and Gentlemen to liue in peace and amitie one with another, and all sorts as brethren to liue euenly to∣gether, deuised a way to set all men again together by the eares, and to embarke themselues into newe troubles. Hee therefore with the assent of his associats, spread abroade diuers calumniations, and slanderous rumours of those of the reformed Religion, &amp; being a gratious man with the Queen mother, for that their humors were but too agreeable and consonant each to other, he perswa∣ded with her, that if shee should countenance the cheefe Princes and Lords of the Religion, and suffer them to be neere the Court, and beare a sway in mat∣ters of State, they would draw on many followers after them, and peraduen∣ture gaine the yong King and the Princes his brethren to be their friends, and then <HI>Conde</HI> being a man of courage and of that proximitie in bloud would looke to haue his place: which if hee might peaceably enioy, her authoritie would be quickly in the dust, and the Burbons, Memorancies, and Chastillons would rule all: and as it was most likely, shee should bee called to an account for her former gouernement, during the Kings nonage: and by drawing on the hatred of the Catholikes, of the Pope, and of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> loose al her credit and reputation.</P>
<P>The Queene mother being iealous inough of her estate before, and nowe encouraged by the Cardinall to role euerie stone rather then to loose one iot of her authoritie, discountenanced all that shee might those of the Religion, and to be ridde of the Admirall, whome for his wisedome, integritie, valour, and vprightnesse of all his actions shee could not abide, it was deuised that hee should be charged to haue hired <HI>Poltrot</HI> to kill the late Duke of <HI>Guyse:</HI> and to colour the matter withal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there was a counterfeit deposition of <HI>Poltrot</HI> exhibi∣ted, and the yong Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> was animated to demand iustice of the K. for the death of his father.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The yong Duke of of Guyse set on to accuse the Admiral of the mur∣ther of his father.</NOTE> But when this deuise came to the prince of <HI>Condes</HI> eare, Lord howe exceedingly was hee offended, protesting, and that openly at the
<PB N="64" REF="36"/> Councell Table, that hee would spend all that euer hee had, yea, and his owne life too, before the Admirall whom hee knew to be innocent, should be so in∣iuriously handled: which speech of the Princes, with some other considerati∣ons, was the cause that this pursute ceased for that time, and a reconciliation was made betweene the Admirall, and those of the <HI>Guyse,</HI> at <HI>Moulins,</HI> immedi∣atly before the King was about to go in progresse to <HI>Bayon.</HI></P>
<P>Albeit the Admirall was no further troubled at this instant, yet it was a meanes to make him hated and detested of all the Catholikes, and a principall cause of sundrie quarrelles betweene the Papists and the Protestants, which in the ende prooued so great, that they drew on a second ciuill warre: for there grewe daily complaints, each charging other with the breach of the Kings E∣dict, and many accusations were broached on both sides. The Catholikes complained, that the strong Townes and fortresses were not yeelded to the kings obeysance, that there were many preachers which were not allowed of by the Edict, and that they preached in sundrie places expressely prohi∣bited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣plaints of the Catholikes and Prote∣stants.</NOTE> that they were disgraced with many approbrious and scandalous spee∣ches, and that there were secret practises for the leuying of Souldiers in <HI>Germany</HI> and other places, which shoulde bee in a readinesse vppon the first sommance.</P>
<P>The Protestants alleaged that they were rigorously handled, and could not haue iustice when they complained: that the insolencie of the garrisons which were placed in sundrie protestant Townes, was intollerable and could not be indured: that there were daily murtherers of the reformed in euery corner of the Lande, and nothing so common as robbing, spoyling, rauishing, pilling and poulling the poore Hugonots, and no punishment inflicted vppon the Authours and abbettors of such horrible and derestable vil∣lanies.</P>
<P>These and the like complaints beeing often reiterated on both sides, and each faction nourishing their suspitions, vppon euery small occasion: their rancour grew greater &amp; greater, and those smal sparks which for a while lay couered in ashes, brake out at last into a furious and raging fire. For the Catholikes had no sooner gotten all things in a readines, exacted their cittadels into the protestant Townes, placed their garrisons, sworne their associations and leagues (which were tearmed the confraternities of the holy Ghost) and that vnder the colour of viewing the state of the Lande, the king was gone to <HI>Bayon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The league made at Bay¦on among the Catholikes.</NOTE> there to make a confederacy betweene himselfe and the Spanish king, and the Duke of <HI>Alua,</HI> to roote out all the Hugonots, but that a Million of iniuries and indignities were offered to the poore protestants. There was an Edict made at <HI>Rousillon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Edict of Rousillon.</NOTE> which was tearmed a declaration or an exposition of the edict of the pacification: but this was so contrarie to those articles which had beene agreed vppon before; that al men might see they had fully resolued to breake their promises with the Protestants. Then did there follow immediatly after, most barbarous cruelties and tyrannicall oppressions of all sorts which made any profession of the Go∣spel, though it were neuer so little: which when the Protestants (to their vn∣speakeable greefe) behelde, and that after so many iust complaints there was no redresse to bee hoped for by faire meanes, but that their vsage was likely to bee worse and worse, for that the sixe thousand Switzers were still retained in a rea∣dinesse
<PB N="65" REF="36"/> to bee employed against them vppon the sodaine, as they vehemently suspected, they thought it high time to looke about them, and to studie howe they might best preuent so imminent perils.</P>
<P>Whereupon they wrote letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prote∣stants begin to prouide for themselues.</NOTE> and sent their secret messengers into al quar∣ters, to aduertise their associats, to vse al the speed that could be made, &amp; to come and attend the Prince of <HI>Conde, Rochfaucont,</HI> and the Admirall, <HI>Dandelot,</HI> and o∣thers who were their principall cheefetaines.

As soone as the Queene mother vnder∣stood of the dismarch of the Prince, and that hee came directly towardes the King, shee resolued at midnight to dislodge, and to hasten to <HI>Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King flyeth to Pa∣ris.</NOTE> leauing the Constable with the battailon of Switzers and some eight or nine hundred French horse, to stop the course of the Protestants: who seeing them¦selues ouermatched, and that they could neither by faire meanes nor by foule be admitted to the speech of the King, who was by this time gotten within <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> they retired towardes <HI>Clay,</HI> expecting the rest of their forces, which dai∣ly repaired vnto them out of <HI>Picardy, Champaigne, Poictou, Guyen,</HI> and sundrie other places of the Land: where they stayed not long, but marched towardes Saint <HI>Dennis,</HI> which was a little village some two leagues distant from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

But such were the wicked counsels of some turbulent spirits, that they could not endure any quietnes, but gaue daily occasions to fill the whole land full of new broyles and vprores. The two late reconciled factions were continually very iealous each of others proceedings, one blamed the other for not accomplishing such conditions as were agreed vpon, and so solemnly sworne on both sides. The Catholiks alledged that the Protestants had not put all their strong townes into the kings hands, according to the tenure of the Articles of the peace lately agreed vpon: that <HI>Rochell</HI> did fortifie it selfe, and would not receyue the Catholikes into their former offices and dignities:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣plaints of the Catholiks.</NOTE> that they rigged shippes, and made themselues strong at sea, and that without the kings knowledge: that <HI>Coqueuille</HI> leuied many soldiers for the ayd of the prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> contrarie to the pacification made before <HI>Chartres.</HI> All which things could not be attēpted without the knowledge of the confederats: &amp; that which was most strange of al, they practised to leuy soldiers in <HI>Germany,</HI> &amp; other places.</P>
<P>The Protestants complained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣plaints of the Protestants.</NOTE> that they could not be permitted freely to vse their consciences, according as it was conditioned.

Alledging withall, the horrible murthers, robberies, and other execrable facts, committed vpon the persons, and goods of those of the reformed Churches. These with some others were the reasons which animated both parts to stirre coales, and to begin the warres afresh.</P>
<P>The Catholikes knowing <HI>Rochell</HI> to be a verie strong place, sought by al cun∣ning deuises to make themselues maisters thereof, and with fayre promises in∣termingled with threats, laboured to perswade them to receyue a garrison of the Catholikes, but they would in no case agree thereto, but still droue them of with newe delayes. <HI>Tauannes</HI> was commaunded to surprise the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prince of Conde in danger to bee taken by Tauannes.</NOTE> who was then in <HI>Noyars.</HI> But hee beeing aduertised thereof, depar∣ted in great haste, with the Princesse his wife, the Admirall, and some hundred horse: and passing ouer the <HI>Loyer,</HI> went into <HI>Poictou,</HI> where increa∣sing his forces, by the comming of <HI>Verac, Soubize, Anguilier, Saint Cyre,</HI> and <HI>Puuiant,</HI> at last arriued at <HI>Rochell,</HI> in despite of all his enemies, whither not long

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur made lieute∣nant for the King his brother.</NOTE>The King being aduertised of all these designements, declared <HI>Monsieur</HI> the Duke of <HI>Aniou</HI> his brother, his Lieutenant generall: who dispatched forthwith Letters and Messengers into all parts, to assemble <HI>Bannes</HI> and <HI>Arierbannes,</HI> and to command all gentlemen, and others to be in a readinesse at the time appointed, at <HI>Estamps,</HI> where he had proclaimed the <HI>Rendeuous,</HI> there to attend the further pleasure of his excellencie.

VVhich when the Confede∣rates vnderstoode, they passed <HI>Charente</HI> at <HI>Cognac,</HI> with purpose to preuent the Armie of the Catholiques: <MILESTONE N="1569"/> who hauing gayned <HI>Chasteaunef,</HI> repayred the Bridge, which was in the possession of the Protestants, and made an other with Boats.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The battell of Bassac.</NOTE>The Admirall being appointed to impeach the making of these new bridges considering he was not able to effect that which he desired, retired vnto <HI>Bassac,</HI> ordayning <HI>Soubize, Puuiant,</HI> and other troupes of <HI>Poictou,</HI> to fauour his retreate. The Prince (all things being well considered) was not willing to resolue of a battaile, and therefore willed the Admirall to dislodge with the auaunt∣garde, and to bee with him at <HI>Farnac</HI> the next morning by the breake of the day. Which in no wise could be performed by all: for the companies ledde by <HI>Puuiant,</HI> could not march so speedily, the Catholikes being at their taile, and so strongly pressed them, that they could not bee disgaged, but with the hazarde and perill of all the Protestants. For the footemen of his excellencie ha∣uing passed a Riuer, doubled their pace to gaine a little hill, which was
<PB N="73" REF="40"/> a place of some aduauntage: from which they discouering how small a compa∣nie the Admirall had, aduaunced still forward, knowing that he could not re∣tire, without the intire losse of all his troupes.

But when as they had with all theyr deuoir succored them in their need, they were forthwith compelled to defend themselues vpon the bay of a pond, where they were so lustily charged by <HI>Mar∣tigues, Malicorne,</HI> and others to the number of fiue of sixe hundred horse, that <HI>La Noue,</HI> and <HI>La Loue</HI> were taken prisoners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La Noue &amp; La Loue ta∣ken priso∣ners.</NOTE> and all their bands intirely broken, and defeated. <HI>Puuiant</HI> hauing charged, and finding himselfe too weake, retired to the rest of the footmen. During these hot skirmishes, sundry of the Catholikes were aduanced forwards, wherof some two hundred came hard to the village: whō when the Admirall and <HI>Dandelot</HI> discouered, beeing ignorant of the ouerthrow aforesayde, for that the village hindered theyr sight, they resolutely charged: and <HI>Dandelot</HI> being formost with his cornet, gaue in so furiously, that he made them all to run amaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dandelot ma¦keth the Ca∣tholiques to runne.</NOTE> leauing behind them <HI>Monsales,</HI> and thirteen others dead vpon the place. <HI>Dandelot</HI> pursued them hard to the village, from whence he was no sooner returned, but those Catholikes being backed with 1200. harquebuzi∣ers, reentred more strongly accompanied then before. Whilest things passed on after this maner, al the rest of the troups of the Catholikes began to shew them∣selues, euery regiment taking his place for the last encounter.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> beeing aduertised of all this, and of the daunger that the Admirall with all the Auauntgard was in, if they were not speedily suc∣coured, aduaunced himselfe with those few horsemen of his battaile, which he tumultuously assembled in that vprore, the rest beeing dispersed into seuerall quarters here and there, hasted to the rescue with all the speede that might bee. Each Generall began nowe to seeke his aduauntage, and to prepare himselfe to the fight. The Admirall espying that <HI>Monsieur</HI> came fast on vpon the left hand, which was the meanes to enclose the Protestants betweene the riuer, and the armie of the Catholikes, commaunded <HI>La Touer</HI> to bring the companies of the Auantgard further forwards: which he did, and bare himselfe so, that his horse being ouerthrowne, he was taken, and beeing knowne to be the man that had slaine captaine <HI>Carry</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> was killed forthwith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La Touer slaine.</NOTE> besides many others, who had no better fortune.</P>
<P>The army Catholike still stretched it selfe forth vpon the left hande, towards the troupes of <HI>Soubize, Languillier, Puuiant, Cressomere,</HI> and the rest of the Chieftaines of <HI>Poictou:</HI> who thinking it not conuenient to expect anie oc∣casion for a better charge, seeing the enemie reenforce himselfe more and more, assayled the formost Troupes with such furie, that they made them recule: but by reason of newe supplyes which were sent continuallie, <HI>Sou∣bize,</HI> and <HI>Languillier</HI> were taken prisoners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soubiz, and many other taken priso∣ners.</NOTE> <HI>Mesauchere, Brandamere,</HI> and ma∣nie others were then slaine. In the meane time his excellencie desirous to breake them on all sides, brought a great part of his armie an other way, purposing to enclose them, who kept the bay of the ponde, and to assayle them on the backe. But this pretence being espied, the confederates, who had
<PB N="74" REF="41"/> maintained the aduantage of the ground a good while, thought it best to retyre into a place of greater safetie. Whilest the fight was thus hotely continued on either side, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with three or foure hundred horse, gaue a hote charge vpon the Catholiques: and being chaufed to see his men in rout, and the whole army to bear it self no better, flang in with such fury, that he bare to the ground, or made to run all that were before him, vntill such time as his horse beeing wounded, hee was ouerthrowne, and not able any longer to doo any thing for the blowes hee had receyued: and because hee was not succou∣red with a fresh horse in tyme, seeing his enemies to presse sore vppon him, hee yeelded vnto <HI>Argence,</HI> and Saint <HI>Iean,</HI> who promised to saue his life: but <HI>Montesquion</HI> (as some say) passing by at that instant, shot him into the head with a pistoll, whereof he died forthwith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prince of Conde slaine.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now was the disorder exceeding great among the Protestants, who hauing lost their Generall, began to flie as fast as they could, and to get out of the daun∣ger of their pursuing enemies.

<P>But the Admirall with the principall of the confederates, gaue them quickly to vnderstand, that the matter was likely to be farre otherwise then they imagi∣ned. For they gathering togither their dispersed forces, fortifyed <HI>Cognac, Angolesme, Pos, Saint Gean d'Angely,</HI> and other places, wherein they plan∣ted strong garrisons to amuse the armie of the Catholiques, vntill the com∣ming of the Duke of <HI>Deux Ponts,</HI> who was alreadie marching with a great power, to the reliefe of the confederates.

<P>The Duke of <HI>Deux Ponts,</HI> who was hasting to the aide of the Protestants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Deux Ponts com∣meth to ayde the prote∣stants with a great power</NOTE> had in his armie seauen thousand and fiue hundred Reisters, and sixe thousande Lansquenetes, with whom were ioyned the Prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> the two Counts <HI>Ludouicus</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> his brethren, with a small band of their followers: besides <HI>Moruilliers</HI> the marquesse of <HI>Reuel, Fequieres, Cleruant, Mouy,</HI> and <HI>Esternay,</HI> with certaine culuerings, sixe field peeces, and a good number of Musqueters: with those companies he got forward as fast as hee might, still gayning ground, and approching the territories of <HI>France,</HI> notwithstanding al the hindrances and lets which were giuen by the Duke of <HI>Aumaile,</HI> who with a great power was ap∣pointed to stoppe the passages, and to barre this <HI>Almain</HI> Duke out of the fertile countrey of the <HI>Flower de Lis:</HI> but that could not be, for still hee passed foorth, and at last rested himselfe before <HI>La Charite,</HI> a towne of great importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La Charity besieged and taken by a composition.</NOTE> and scituated (as it were) in the heart and bowels of <HI>France.</HI> The Towne was verie straightly besieged, and planting his battery, he beate the wals in such furious maner, that those within beeing not able to holde out, and dispairing of any suc∣cours in time, yeelded vpon composition, to haue their liues saued, and so was it sacked and spoyled by the Lansquenetes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">La Charity sacked.</NOTE> The taking of the towne was no small aduantage to the confederates, as also the losse thereof did much hinder the fortunate course of the victorious Catholikes, who now began to consult how to impeach the two armies, that they should not meete and vnite them∣selues together: but doo what they could the Duke still aduanced forwardes, passed through <HI>Lymosin</HI> so farre as <HI>Cars,</HI> where falling sicke hee dyed of a quartaine Feuer, tothe exceeding greefe of all his friendes and followers.</P>

Whereupon all the troupes were forthwith arranged and put in battaile array: the Admirall assisted by <HI>Beaunois, La Nocle, Briquemant, Soubize, La Noue, Teligny,</HI> and others, led the vantgard followed by their seueral Cornets, and a great Hot of Reisters, conducted by Count <HI>Ludouic,</HI> brother to the Prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> who were flanked with the Regiments of <HI>Be∣audisne</HI> and <HI>Piles,</HI> and on the left hand with <HI>Rouuray</HI> &amp; <HI>Pouille:</HI> a strong battailon of Lansquenetes backed the auauntgard, which carried in the front eight field peeces.

<P>Now began the affaires of the Protestants to go backwards, and euery day to bee crossed more and more: for shortly after their victuals failed them, and great multitudes of their armies fell sick, and no small number were greeuously wounded and hurt: the Admirall himselfe fell into a desperate disease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Admi∣ral dangerou∣sly sicke.</NOTE> and all men thought he should neuer haue recouered. <HI>Rochfaucont, Acier, Briquemant, Beauuoise, La Nocle,</HI> and others of speciall account were so sickly and weake, that they were forced to remooue from the Army, so that not one of them (except the Admirall and <HI>Acier</HI>) were able to bee at the battaile of <HI>Mont∣counter.</HI></P>

<P>His excellency with the direction of his best aduisants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of Monsieurs battaile.</NOTE> deuided his whole forces into a vantgard and a battaile: the aduantgard was composed of French∣men, Almaines, and Italians, ledde by the Prince <HI>Dauphin,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Guyse, Martigmes, Chauigny, La Valette,</HI> the Count <HI>VVestemberg,</HI> the <HI>Reingraue Bassompier,</HI> Saint <HI>Fior, Paul Sforza, Disci, Santelle,</HI> with well neere three thousand horse: The grosse battailon of Switzers which consisted of foure thousande, was led by Collonell <HI>Clere,</HI> flanked with fiue Regiments of harquebuziers, French∣men and Italians, vnder the conduct of <HI>La Barthe, Sarlabois, Onoux,</HI> and sundry others: ouer all these commanded the Duke of <HI>Montpensier.</HI> The battaile was composed of the Dukes of <HI>Aumaile</HI> and <HI>Longauille,</HI> the Mareschal <HI>Cossy, Tauannes,</HI> the Marquesse of <HI>Villiers,</HI> &amp;c. with three thousand horse, and another Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> cousin to the Protestant, and fiue Cornets of a thousand or a thou∣sand and two hundred horse.

All these had theyr <HI>Enfans Perdus</HI> in their front, who carried death engrauem in their foreheads, as well for themselues, as for whomsoeuer they first attached. All this Armie which consisted of aboue nine thousande horse, 17. or 18. thousand footmen, and 15. peeces of great Ordenance, was commaunded by his excellencie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke Montpensi∣er chargeth the Prote∣stants.</NOTE> and beeing ready arranged, awaited when the signe shoulde bee giuen, but first they fought a farre off with theyr great shotte, which for that it
<PB N="80" REF="44"/> was skilfully directed by the Cannoneres, made a sore slaughter on both sides. This thundering and terrible noyse was no sooner ceased, and the Artillery re∣tired, but the Trumpets sounded <HI>Dedans, dedans,</HI> and the Duke <HI>Montpensier,</HI> went resolutely to the Charge, and gaue in so hotly vppon <HI>Mouy</HI> and his Regi∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mouy with his bands defeated.</NOTE> that hee being abandoned by his two Cornets of Reisters, who were ap∣pointed to second him, was forced to get him as fast as he could out of the dan∣ger, and to saue the greatest part of his troupes among the footmen: who be∣ing mightily dismaide with so pittious an accident, lost their hearts, and disban∣ding themselues, ranne all away for the best game. Now beganne the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> with his associats to come lustily forwardes, and in their appointed quar∣ter to charge their enemies: who receiued them with equall courage, so that there grew a very warme fight on both sides. The harquebuziers whome the Admirall had interlaced among his French Launces, played the men, and set of the Catholikes at their pleasure, knowing they were well assured by their horsemen, who serued to guard them at their neede.</P>
<P>The Admirall, who by reason of his great experience in the warres, both at home and abroade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The princes withdraw themselues from the bat∣taile as se∣cretly as they could.</NOTE> and the diligent marking of so diuers euents as had run be∣fore his eyes, iudging of the sequell by this vnfortunate beginning, counsel∣led the yong Princes to retire as couertly &amp; with as smal a traine as they could: but many whose eyes were prying about, and glad to take any occasion to bee gone, espying the retreat &amp; coueting to enfranchise themselues from so great perill as was present before their faces, would needes accompanie them whe∣ther they would or not, so that they had quickly more attendants then eyther they expected or desired.</P>
<P>By this time was the rest of the aduauntgard which was led by the Admirall and <HI>Acier,</HI> hotly charged by the Reisters Catholikes, who so furiously encoun∣tred them, that many ended their daies at that instant. The Admirall himselfe was in such danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The admiral hurt, and in danger to bee taken.</NOTE> that hee was hurt in the face, through the default of such as should haue couered him, and was so farre intermedled among the Catholikes, that had not Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> with foure or fiue cornets of Reisters disgaged him, he had vndoubtedly fallen into their hands who loued him but a little.</P>
<P>While these bloudy broyles were continued betweene the aduantgards, his exellency caused his maine battaile to dismarch, the right wing whereof, in which was the Duke of <HI>Aumaile,</HI> and the marquesse of <HI>Baden</HI> with all his Rei∣sters, gaue in so farre afore the rest, that the marquesse was there slaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mar∣quesse of Ba∣den slaine.</NOTE> and ma∣ny others for, companions of that mortall charge: and <HI>Monsieur</HI> himselfe, albeit hee marched full vppon the discouerie of the great Artillery, made such haste, that he left the Switzers vnder Collonell <HI>Phiffer,</HI> and their generall <HI>Memie,</HI> with the other battailon very farre behind: which when the Protestants troupes dis∣couered, they casting themselues desperately into his esquadron, breaking in euen hard to their Cornet, made them that followed his excellencie to abandon the place: notwithstanding, al the deuoier of the Duke <HI>De Longauille, Touannes, Carnauallet, Villars,</HI> and others, who indeuoured with all their might to repell the insisting confederates: in a word, this charge was so terrible, that the most assured Ensignes beganne to turne head, and had not the mareschall <HI>Cosse</HI> with his Switzers hasted apace, the battaile had quickly beene at an ende.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>
<P>Count <HI>Lodowicke</HI> seeing the Mareschall aduaunce, thrust in verie lustily with his troupes of Almaines and French, who sought it out most couragiously. By this time had the Mareschall <HI>Biron</HI> rallyed diuerse dispersed troupes, and with his owne, which as yet remayned vnbroken, and the Switzers, went directly towardes the Lancequenets:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great car∣nage among the Lance∣quenets.</NOTE> but they beeing abandoned by their horsemen, and shrewdly galled with the harquebuziers, were exposed in a manner to the crueltie of the Switzers, their ancient enemies, who entring in as it were at the breach, committed a wonderfull carnage and mortalitie among them.

<P>And this was the end of this great battell, where both the French men, Al∣maines, Italians, Burgonians, Switzars, Flemings, and Lancequenets had ley∣sure to trie their valours at the full.

<P>Albeit the affayres of the Protestants stoode but in a desperate estate, yet lyke men of great courage, wisedome, and policie, they woulde not shrinke

But they as men resolute to maintaine theyr lyues and libertyes, encouraged each other valyauntlie to abyde the furie of the Catholiques, and laboured day and night to repayre the breaches.

And because the Admirall was a verie wise man, an olde Souldiour, the best experienced Captaine of all <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and most skilfull in war∣like affayres. The King sent the Mareschall <HI>Cossy,</HI> to <HI>Rochell,</HI> to perswade with him to come to the Court, and to assist his soueraigne in so honourable an en∣terprise, the Admirall at the first was very vnwilling of himselfe, and had day∣ly aduertisements to disswade him from that voyage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The admiral goeth to the Court.</NOTE> But after many per∣swasions vsed by the Mareschall, sundry friendly messages from the King, and his fatall mishap (as it were) leading him thereunto, he suffred himself to be gai∣ned, and to be wooed, by those who indeed loued him but a little.</P>

All old rancour and malice seemed to be buried in the pit of obliuion, by reason of this new alliance, which confirmed the hope of a most blessed peace in the time to come. But in the middest of all this ioy and solace, there fell out a sudden accident, which astonished some, and made others to bethinke themselues, and to suspect the worst, and that was this.</P>

One of the Bullets stroke off his fore finger, and with the other hee was wounded in the left Arme. The Admirall poynted to the house from whence the peece was shotte, and wil∣led some of his Gentlemen to go search who was within: sending Captaine <HI>Pilles,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Monius,</HI> to aduertise the King of his hurt.</P>

The King taking with him the Queene mother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king go∣eth to visit the Admiral</NOTE> his two brethren, and most of the principall Catholikes went likewise to comfort him, shewing many signes of great sorrow for his harme, complaining that indeede the Admirall felt the harme, but the disho∣nour was done to the King, vpon whose faithfull promise hee was come to the Court, and therefore both hee that had committed the fact, and all that consen∣ted thereto should bee most seuerely punished, to the example of all other vil∣lanous and notorious malefactors: whereto the Admirall answered, that hee would leaue the reuenge to God, and the execution of Iustice to the King, but as for the authour hee was knowne well inough, and because hee could not tell how long hee had to liue, hee besought the king that hee might talke with him in secret, touching things of very great importance, and such as were most necessarie for the state of the Kingdome. The King seemed to bee willing herewith, but the Queen mother by a deuise brake off their talke for that time, so that there was no further conference: and because the king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and diuers others, moued the king that they might haue leaue to carrie the Admiral to his house at <HI>Chastillon,</HI> which was some two daies iour∣ney from <HI>Paris,</HI> as to a place of greater quiet and securitie: the king not willing to condiscend thereunto, answered, that so long a iourney would very much endanger his health: and therefore he thought it better to haue him lodged in the <HI>Louure</HI> neere vnto his owne person, where he should be safe from all perill: furthermore he willed all the cheefe of the Protestant Nobilitie, to place them∣selues as neere him as they could, in case that if there were any need they might be readie to succour one another, and appointed the Mareschall <HI>Cossy</HI> with a band of harquebuziers to guard his lodging.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wolfe appointed to keepe the Lambe.</NOTE> Vpon the Satterday, which was the twenty three of August, the councell sat about the examination of certaine witnesses touching the fact, and sundrie other suspected persons, taking great paines (as it seemed) to boult out the truth, as though they meant to punish the offender with all rigour and seueritie. With these and the like apparances, the protestants helde themselues well satisfied, neuer suspecting that all was but dissimulation and that so great mischiefe did hang ouer their heads.</P>
<P>The same day there was a sodaine rumour ouer al the Citie, that the king had sent for the Mareschall <HI>Memorancy,</HI> commanding him to come to him with al the forces hee could make, and therefore the Parisians were best to stande vppon their guard: but all was founde in the end to be vtterly false. <HI>Teligny</HI> beeing gi∣uen to vnderstand by the Admirals trumpetters that there were sixe cart loades
<PB N="88" REF="48"/> of Armour brought into the <HI>Louure,</HI> answered that hee did not like that men should bee so suspitious without cause: for his part hee was well assured of the Kings good fauour, and wished other men were so likewise, seeing it was not possible that there should be any harme intended towardes them whome the king had honoured so many waies. and had oftentimes so solemnely sworne to remaine theyr gracious and louing soueraigne.</P>
<P>But the king with all those of his secret counsell, seeing that they had nowe brought all things about euen as they had desired, and that the Admirall was taken in a trap and all his principall associats, so snarled in their nets that it was impossible for them to get out, thought it high time to putte in execution that which they had purposed so long before, and at that instant to finish the dayes of all the Protestants. Whereuppon a signall was giuen in the dead of the night by the touling of a Bell in the <HI>Louure:</HI> which was no sooner heard by <HI>Cossy,</HI> who (as is alreadie sayde) with a bande of harquebuziers guarded the Admiralles lodging, but that hee commaunded his men to breake open the doores, and to kill as many as they sounde in their wayes. The Admi∣rall hearing the noyse and fearing some seditious enterprise, willed one of his Gentlemen to call to the guard which was appointed him by the King, little imagining that it was they that came to offer him such violence, and a∣rising out of his bedde, putte on his night gowne, and kneeled downe to pray.</P>
<P>By this time were sundrie of the murtherers gotten in, &amp; had slaine such as they found in the house. The first that entred into the Admirals chamber was one <HI>Besme</HI> an Almaine, a desperate ruffian, one of the Duke of <HI>Guyses</HI> houshold ser∣uants, who with his drawne sword in his hand, sayde: Art thou the Admiral? who answered with great constancie, So I am called.

<P>The same day that the Admirall was hurt, the king aduised his brother in law the king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> to cause some tenne or twelue of his trustiest friends to lodge neere him, the better to defende him if the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> (whom he tearmed a shrewd boy) should happen to attempt any thing against him. These Gentlemen and some others who were lodged in the king of <HI>Nauarres</HI> outer Chamber, after the death of the Admirall, and that they were disarmed by <HI>Nan∣cy,</HI> hauing their swords and daggers taken away, were brought to the gate of the <HI>Louure</HI> and there were murthered before the kings face.

<P>Nowe beganne the Courtiers with the kings guard, who were appointed to massacre the Protestant Nobilitie, to kill and murther all sorts in most outra∣gious manner.

<P>By this time was the signall giuen to such as commanded ouer the common people, to make dispatch of the rest of the Protestants, who beeing in a readi∣nesse, and encouraged by the Duke of <HI>Guyse, Aumaile,</HI> and <HI>Neuers,</HI> slew euerie one that fell into their handes: yea, they so greedily thirsted after innocent bloud, that in a short time they had made such a maruailous carnage and but∣cherie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The carnage and butchery in the Citie.</NOTE> that the streetes seemed to be paued with dead carcases, and Carts were laden with the bodies of men, women, and children, which were throwne into the Riuer: death and desolation walked about in euerie corner of this Cittie, and that in most gastly and greeuous manner, to the extreme hor∣ror and dreade of euerie beholder. There was nothing but weeping, wayling, and lamentation, and a most wofull and fearefull crie throughout the whole Citie.</P>

And being still pressed with hunger, they deuised to make meat of old shooes, hornes, horses and bullockes hooues, which had lien hid in the dung∣hils for many yeares: the little children would broyle and rost their girdles to to fill their emptie mawes. Rootes, hearbs, and barkes of trees, serued in steade of iunketting dishes: whatsoeuer had any moysture. taste, sauour, or smell, were it neuer so vnholsome, they eate it with greedinesse. And albeit they were of∣ten shewed of the daunger therof, yet would they not take heede: for the belly had no eares. Yea, so intollerable was the famine, that they eate the verie dung, especially of horses, which was accounted indifferent good, and therfore raked it togither, as a thing of much price. The father and mother eat their own child,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The father and mother eat their own child.</NOTE> which was pined to death with hūger, &amp; for so horrible a fact were both burned. It is incredible what misery was in that towne, and yet they would not yeeld, nor cōmit themselues to the mercy of their enemies. But at length the fa∣min still increasing, &amp; hauing not past 400. souldiers left, and those for the most part sickly, weake and wounded, and seeing no hope of any succors frō any their confederates, were content to hearken to a parle, which was offred vnto them by <HI>La Chastre,</HI> and so by composition to render the towne, with the castle into the hands of the Catholikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Those of Sancerre yeeld vpon composition.</NOTE> who had spent at the least 5914 canon shot, for the gayning of the place, &amp; lost some 1200, or 1300 men, besides a great number that were wounded and sore hurt.</P>
<P>Albeit that the Rochellors had now for a long time very valiantly born them¦selues, and with their often skirmishes and sallyings forth maruailously annoied the assailants, insomuch as that besides the losse of a many common souldiors, and sundry of good account, his excellencie had likewise beene vndoubtedly slaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exam∣ple of a faith∣full seruant.</NOTE> as hee was going to view the Mynes, had not one of his Gentlemen, whose name was <HI>Vius,</HI> espying the fyring of the peece, by putting himselfe

<P>As this extraordinarie prouision did mightily encourage the inhabitants to hold out: so did it not a little dismay their enemies, and made them much more enclinable to peace then before: for they hauing besieged the towne for a long time, and endured much hunger and cold, hoping at last to gaine it, as a recom∣pence for all their labours, did now dispaire thereof, seeing it was so extraordi∣narily victualed, and as it were relieued from heauen.

<P>Although that many, as well Protestants, as Papists, were very glad of this late reconciliation, and with ioyfull hearts thanked the King for their desired peace: yet those of <HI>Quercie, Languedocke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Those of Quercy and Languedock, refuse the peace.</NOTE> and (in a worde) all the Prouinces to∣wards the Leuant seas, were not satisfied therewith: for that (said they) their enemies, and the authours of those execrable Parisian murthers, were still the Kings principal fauourits, and nearest about his person: and therfore they were little assured of any security, but rather had cause to feare an other massacre, con∣sidering the king was ruled by such bad counsel. And further, that there had bin many as strong Edicts, and as solemnly sworn as that at <HI>Rochel,</HI> and yet they pro∣ued but wordes without effect, and serued but as nets to catch the poore Pro∣testants: that with fraudulent and subtile deuises, they had euer preuailed more then by open force: and therfore now it stood them vpon (after so much schoo∣ling) to take better heed vnto themselues, &amp; to beware of the practises of those, who thirsted for nothing so much as for their blood, and the vtter abolishing of their Religion, which they had for many yeares maintained with the daunger of their liues: adding withall, that this last pacification was made but with some particulars, without their consent, and therfore that they were not bound to keepe it, further then they liked of it.</P>
<P>These and the like reasons were alledged by a great number of the Confede: rats, who hauing bin often deceiued, would not now so readily giue eare vnto faire promises, but meant to stand vpon their gards, and as warily as might be, to watch the Catholikes at euery turne. And to the intent they might the better maintaine their reputation, and with greater dexteritie manage their affayres, they first assembled at <HI>Millaua</HI> in <HI>Rouergne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The assembly of the Pro∣testants.</NOTE> and afterwards at <HI>Montaubau,</HI> where after long and mature deliberation, they established an orderly course for the rest of their proceedings. And hauing gotten sundry strong townes, forts and castels into their handes, they flatly refused those conditions of peace, which the Rochellers had accepted, &amp; fortifying themselues with a newe association and league, began to annoy the Catholiks with open warre.</P>

There were also great numbers of the Catholikes, who receyuing small fauour at the Kings hands, neither were so rewarded for their seruices as they expected, grew male∣conts, and seeing <HI>Monsieur</HI> the Kings brother was departed into <HI>Polonia,</HI> they thought it now fit time to take their aduauntage, and by leaguing themselues with the Protestants, to reforme the policy of the land, and to reclaim the king, who (said they) was wholy misled by the wicked coūsels of such, as were stran∣gers and enemies tothe Crowne of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>They had also practised with the Duke of <HI>Alenson,</HI> the Kings yongest brother, to take part with them, and found him not vnwilling to becom their leader, and generall in this so hautie an enterprise.

<P>The Confederates hauing all things thus in a readinesse, attended the depar∣ture of the Duke of <HI>Alenson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Alenson dis∣swaded from going in the Protestants.</NOTE> the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> from the Court, and for their better safetie had sent some two hundred horse to Saint <HI>Germain</HI> in Lay: but the King being made priuie hereof, and his excellencie di∣uerted by <HI>La Moly,</HI> the proceedings of the Protestants were mightily crossed, for the time: howbeit, like men of courage, and resolution, they went forwards, and openly inuaded the Catholiques, both by sea and land. <HI>Montgommerie,</HI> who for a long while had beene in the Ile of <HI>Gersey,</HI> landed on the sudden in <HI>Norman∣die,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Montgom∣mery landeth in Normandy</NOTE> ioyning with the Columbiers, and incorporating himselfe with the <HI>Norman</HI> troupes, made sharpe warre vpon the Papists, getting many townes and fortres∣ses, which were very aduantagious for the Protestants.</P>
<P>Great preparation was made by the King, to withstand these proceedings, and proclamation was sent out into all parts to assemble the <HI>Bannes</HI> and <HI>Arierbannes,</HI> and such was the diligence vsed herein, that there was quickely gathered toge∣ther a sufficient number to make two armyes, which the King presently diui∣ded, sending the one into <HI>Poictou,</HI> vnder the conduct of <HI>Montpencier,</HI> against <HI>La Noue,</HI> and the other vnder the leading of <HI>Mategnon</HI> into <HI>Bas Normandie,</HI> agaynst the Count <HI>Mongommerie,</HI> who preuayled mightily against the Catholiques, sei∣sing vpon sundry their best townes, and strongest holds, and raunging euery where at his pleasure.

<P>The king of <HI>Polonia</HI> being aduertised of his brothers death by letters from the Queene mother, and that he was now become heire to the Crowne of <HI>France,</HI> albeit he was quietly established, and a king ouer a mightie kingdome, which was euerie way both very profitable and honourable vnto him, yet (as the na∣ture of all men is, to loue their owne naturall countrey more then another) hee presently resolued to returne home againe, and as shortly as might be, to beholde the goodly and pleasant fieldes of the <HI>Flower de Lis:</HI> but the great loue and reuerence which the Polonians bare vnto him, (who hauing vnderstood that the disease wherewith his brother <HI>Charles</HI> was afflicted was incurable, and that peraduenture the Crowne of <HI>France</HI> would quickly intyce him out of <HI>Polonia</HI>) made them watch ouer him with so vigilant an eye, and to obserue him so narrowly, that it caused him to doubt what course he should take to escape their hands: and beeing (indeede) induced by sundrie strong presumptions, to think that they would in no wise condiscend to his departure, &amp; that it were but lost labor, yea, peraduenture much harme to acquaint them with his inten∣ded voyage, determined to accomplish his purpose as closely and as secretly as he might, and to leaue them his reasons in writing, of so sodaine and hasty de∣parture.

The want whereof, as it hath euermore beene the bane of many most flourishing nations, so hath it been the principall motiue of such lamentable desolation as hath spread it selfe, and that in most outragious manner, ouer the face of that noble Kingdome of <HI>France:</HI> where, albeit that some of the latter Kings haue not beene so vertuously dispo∣sed as were to bee wished, which notwithstanding may peraduenture in some sort bee executed in regarde of their mynoritie and want of good education: by meanes whereof they haue the more easily beene enduced to giue their al∣lowance to many most wicked and vngodly proceedings: yet is it out of que∣stion, that the gratest misteries which haue there fallen out, haue beene hat∣ched and brought foorth by the deuillish and pestiferous practises of sundrie Councellers, who through the benefit of their good fortune and fauour of their Princes, haue attained vnto great places, and had the managing of the whole state.</P>

And being growne verie gracious among the French, by reason of his fortunate successe in the warres, caused it to bee se∣cretly spredde abroade among the people, that hee was descended from <HI>Charle∣maine,</HI> and therefore had some right and title to the Crowne of <HI>Fraunce.</HI> And as though hee meant one day to put in his clayme, had so ordered the matter, that great numbers of the Nobilitie, and sundrie of the principall Citties of the lande, were wholie at his deuotion: but hee was cutte off in the middest of his hope (as is alreadie sayde) before <HI>Orleaunce,</HI> and all his deuices came to naught, sauing that he left behind him a sonne, as hautie, as aspiring, and as am∣bitious as euer was the father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henrie duke of Guise his ambitious &amp; turbulent nature.</NOTE> and one that attempted greater matters then euer did any of that line.</P>
<P>This man beeing growne into great credite with <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, and likewise with <HI>Henrie</HI> the thirde, so aduaunced himselfe by their fauours, that he gaue the lawe to <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and did euery thing as he lysted. And practising those rules which his father and vncle had left him, was euermore deuising howe to trouble the state, and to holde the King at continuall strife with his subiects, as the readyest and speedyest way to compasse that, which that facti∣ous and turbulent house had so greedily gaped after for these many yeares. VVhereupon hee pondering with himselfe, that if this late reconciliation which was made betweene the King and his subiects, shoulde continue, that the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> with their adherents and asso∣ciates, would quickely growe mightie, and so with theyr power and autho∣ritie, easily ouerthrowe all his councelles, and that in such sort, as hee should neuer bee able to accomplish and fulfill his intended purpose, thought it best and most expedient for his aduantages, to beginne newe broyles and sturres, and with a sixt ciuill warre to bring <HI>France</HI> againe into a <HI>Chaos</HI> and con∣fusion.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1576"/> The better to effect this, and to lay as sure a foundation as might bee for so badde a buylding, it was deuised, that the Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and a cer∣taine Aduocate called <HI>Dauid,</HI> as craftie, as wilie, and as wicked a fellowe as a∣nie lyued in those dayes, shoulde bee sent to <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bishop of Paris &amp; the aduocate Dauid sent to Rome.</NOTE> to haue the direction of the Pope, and his Cardinalles, howe it were best to beginne, and afterwards most circumspectlie to proccede and go forwardes in so hautie and weightie an en∣terprise.</P>
<P>There were many bitter complaints, and sharpe accusations framed agaynst <HI>Henrie</HI> the third the French King, against <HI>Monsieur</HI> his brother, the king of <HI>Na∣uarre,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> against the race of the <HI>Valoises,</HI> the <HI>Burbons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Accusations against the houses of Valois and Burbon.</NOTE> all the prin∣ces of the blood, and the auncient Nobilitie of <HI>Fraunce:</HI> they were all either he∣retikes, or fauourers of heretikes, and by their late pacification, entended the vtter subuersion of the holie Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> There it was shewed, to make the King and all his Princes the more odious, howe the house of <HI>Capet,</HI> had alwayes withstoode the Bishoppes of <HI>Rome,</HI> and had in olde time maintained

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Councel holden at Rome for the rooting out of the blood Roiall of France.</NOTE>And for the more speedie accomplishment hereof, it was resolued, that the <HI>Guises</HI> with their partakers should procure newe commotions in the lande, and nourish the warres by all possible meanes that might bee.

<P><MILESTONE N="1577"/> Whilest these things were a working at <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Guises</HI> with their adherents fought by all possible meanes to breake the peace in <HI>France,</HI> and by grieuous op∣pressions and wrongs, to force those of the reformed religion, to put themselues in arms to withstād so iniurious proceedings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur forsaketh the Protestants, and goeth to the Court.</NOTE> And albeit they were but too for∣ward to blow the bellowes of sedition before: yet now vpon the returne of <HI>Da∣uid</HI> from <HI>Rome,</HI> they went eagrely forward, and with great earnestnesse endeuo∣red to put those rules in practise, which came from their holy father. There wer leagues and associations made, and those as strong as could be deuised. The states were summoned, and by the collusion of the King, none admitted to be at that assembly, but such as were vtter enemies to the Gospel. <HI>Monsieur,</HI> by the ear∣nest intreatie of the Queene mother, was brought to the Court, and hauing made his benefite of the fauor of the Protestants, left them when they had most need of him and associated himselfe with their sworne enemies.</P>
<P>The King likewise beganne to interpret his Edict after a straunge maner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣plaints of the Catholikes.</NOTE> and farre otherwise then was expected by the confederates. Some articles were strained, and racked out to the vttermost, and other some snipped and curtailed, that they seemed metamorphosed, and changed into a new nature, as farre diffe∣ring from their former, as might be imagined. Many infamous libels were prin∣ted, contayning most villainous matter agaynst the Protestants: and a ru∣mour was spread abroade, that they had surprised sundrie Townes and fortes in <HI>Poictou, Languedocke, Guyen, Xantoigne,</HI> and <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and therefore that it was impossible to holde in the Catholiques anie longer, who with so manifold iniuries (saide they) were mightily incensed agaynst those of the reformed Churches.</P>
<P>Those of the Religion were exceedingly troubled with this strange kind of dealing, and knowing that it proceeded of a mortall hatred, and that it did euidently argue, that there was a secrete purpose to catch them at aduauntage, and then to make hauocke of them, and to roote them and their Religion out of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> they beganne to looke about them, and to prouide for their owne securitie, especiallie considering howe the Catholiques were leagued togi∣ther, and were readie (as it were at an instaunt) to inuade them on all sides.

Thus the peace hauing
<PB N="108" REF="58"/> endured but a small time, the sixt ciuill war ensued immediately, vpon the report that it was concluded by King in the assembly of the states, that there should be no other, but the Romane Catholike religion, tollerated within all his territo∣ries and dominions: for then began the warres to be open on all sides. The Ca∣tholikes seysed vpon <HI>Du Pont, S: Espirit, Merpin, Tallemond, Burdeaux,</HI> and as ma∣nie other townes as they could get. The Protestants surprised <HI>Pons, Royan, Reole,</HI> and <HI>Cinray,</HI> and making a counterleague among themselues, couragiously with∣stood the attempts of their enemies: and foreseeing the stormie tempest, which threatned the ship of their safetie, likewise Pilots, and skilfull Mariners, they stoutly stoode to their tacklings, endeuouring by all possible meanes to saue their beaten barke from drowning, and to bring it to some safe port, and quiet harborrow.</P>
<P>Each side alledged sundrie reasons for the iustification of their actions: the Catholikes layd all the blame vpon the Protestants: saying, that they were men that would not be satisfied with any indifferent fauor: but espying their aduan∣tage, had forced the King to yeeld to vnreasonable conditions. Besides, that the Edict was but prouisionall, and might be disanulled at the Kings pleasure: and that it was now determined by the Estates generall, that no other then the Ro∣man religion should be tollerated within all the French Dominions. The Prote∣stants alledged, that they were murthered and killed in euerie corner, and no pu∣nishment inflicted vpon the malefactors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣plaints of the Protestants.</NOTE> That the Catholikes did dayly breake the Kings Edict, which had beene made by the consent of all the noble persona∣ges of the land, who had solemnely sworne the obseruation thereof: and that if such Edicts were accounted prouisionall, who would repose any trust hereaf∣ter in the Kings worde and promise, seeing he helde it lawfull to breake his oath when hee lysted. And as concerning the estates generall, they sayd, they were not lawfully assembled, and therefore they protested of the nullitie of them, and of whatsoeuer thing they concluded.

For besides that they were ouermatched by lande, they were likewise hardly handled at sea, and had much adoo to keepe the Isle of <HI>Re,</HI> and <HI>Chese de Bay,</HI> from <HI>Lansac,</HI> who was Admirall ouer the nauie Catholique.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lansac bea∣ten at sea by the Prote∣stants.</NOTE> But at last they rigging foorth certaine shippes, commaunded by <HI>Cleremont</HI> of <HI>Amb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is,</HI> so scoured the coast, that no enemie for the time durst appeare in sight of theyr warrelike Fleete, wherewith they were maruellously well recomforted.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1582"/> <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He <HI>Guises</HI> and the rest of the confederates, perceiuing howe the King, with great numbers of his nobles, and cōmon subiects began to take some delight in peace, and that there was an in∣tention to reforme many abuses, which were crept into the state in the time of the ciuill warres: to restore the nobilitie to their auncient dignitie, and to vnburthen the people of sundry charges, wherwith for a long while they had bin grieuously oppressed, were inwardly vexed at the hart, to consider that their former coun∣cels tooke no better effect, and therfore they fel in hand with new practises, and those more pernitious, pestilent, and more dangerous then any others that euer they attempted before. For they considering that the cōdemnation &amp; execution of <HI>Monsieur</HI> the kings brother could not so easily be brought to passe as they de∣sired, and that the king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> did so prudently prouide for their own security, that it was a very hard thing to entrap thē, &amp; bring their persons within danger, thought it best to go secretly to work, and by some priuy means to work their ruine &amp; ouerthrow, against whom they could not preuail by open force and violence. They therfore hired <HI>Salcedo,</HI> a Spaniard to kil <HI>Mon∣sieur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salcedo a Spaniard hi∣red to kill Monsieur.</NOTE> and promised him 6000. crowns for his labor: but he failing of his purpose, they procured a certain Gentlewoman, with whom his excellencie was but too familiarly acquainted, to giue him such a receipt, as neuer left working, till it had wrought the life out of his body: so that he died the 10.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur thought to be poysoned. His death.</NOTE> of Iuly, 1582 to the great reioising of the <HI>Guises,</HI> who now began to triumph to see so fortunat successe and happy aduancement of their affaires. And considering that by the death of this great prince, whō they feared more then the King, their side was maruellously strengthened, they began to stir coles afresh, and sought by all meanes to fill the land full of new broiles and hurli-burlies. And the time fast approching, which was appointed for the bringing forth of that monster, wherewith they had tra∣uailed for a long time, they had many secret conferences with the duke of <HI>Par∣ma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The conspi∣racie of the Guise and the rest of the leaders.</NOTE> <HI>Bernardine Mendoza</HI> the Spanish ambassador, and <HI>Giouan Bardach no,</HI> the King of Spaine his Corriero. There was the bargain made to sell <HI>Marseiles, Burdeaux,</HI> and the Dukedome of <HI>Britaine,</HI> to the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> their maister, &amp; an appoint∣ted time made, that the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> should inuade the Marquisate of <HI>Saluces,</HI> thereby to occupie the King, and to disperse his forces into diuerse and sundrie places. And beeing strongly supported by the fauors of many of the Nobilitie, and sundry of the chiefe Cities, they first required that the Edict of pacification should be reuoked, that the K of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> &amp; prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> with all those who made profession of the gospel, shuld be exiled the realm, or else forced to abiure their religion, &amp; that continual war should be denoūced against the protestants.</P>
<P>The King was aduertised of all these treacherous practises, as well
<PB N="111" REF="59"/> from sundrie the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> as also from the King of <HI>Nauarre:</HI> but hee would not beleeue any thing, but tooke them to be but slanderous reports, rai∣sed vp by the Hugonots, and therefore lightly regarded them: but still counte∣nanced the Guyses and their adherents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sediti∣ous practises of the Guyses</NOTE> who hauing gotten the King to ioyne with them, &amp; to yeeld to their requests, they hired the Monks and Friers to stir vp the people to their seditious ceremonies, shriuings and priuate conferences, to bande with them and the rest of the Leagues, and to persecute those of the Religion with fire and sword, and to roote them and theirs out of the territo∣ries of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>They caused sundrie infamous Libels to be spread abroad, and gaue out that the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> and the Protestant Princes had sworne to roote out the Ca∣tholike faith, and to depriue them of the Romish Church of all honour, digni∣tie and authoritie: that the murther at <HI>Paris</HI> should be reuenged, and that three of the principall Burgesses of euerie Citie and towne, should be put to death in reuenge of the saide murther. These with many other notorious vntruths were openly declared in their pulpets wherewith the common sort were mightily enraged against the Protestants, and desired nothing more then their vtter sub∣uersion and ouerthrow. The Guyses hauing likewise obtained good store of Spanish pistolets, corrupted diuers great personages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin∣ning of the seauenth ci∣uill warres, called the warres of the Leaguers.</NOTE> and had hired sundrie Captaines to take their parts. Hauing laide this foundation, and prouided all necessaries that could be deuised for the rest of their building, about the fourth of March, 1585. <MILESTONE N="1585"/> they brake foorth and shewed themselues openly, seising vpon sundrie the kings Townes, Cities, and fortresses, supposing (indeede) that the rest would ioyne with them and take their parts: but things falling out contra∣rie to their expectation, they were forced to plucke in their heads for a while, and to attend some better oportunitie: and that so much the rather for that the K. the better sort of the Nobilitie, and the courts of Parliament, opposed them∣selues against their proceedings, declaring them Rebelles, and willing all the gouernours of Townes and prouinces to apprehende them, and to see them punished as seditious persons, and perturbers of the State.</P>
<P>This audacious action seemed very odious in the eyes of many: which the Guyses perceiuing, they drew in the Cardinall of <HI>Burbon</HI> by sundrie fine deui∣ses, to ioyn with them, whose credit and countenance serued their turnes in ma∣ny great attempts. And because sundrie of the Kings Councellers were either the Guyses creatures, or by some one way or other deuoted vnto them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king be∣trayed by his Councell.</NOTE> the king was neuer duly enformed of the danger of the League: for they told him that it was nothing but an inconsiderate zeale of some few, who fearing the in∣nouation of Religion, were growne somewhat passionate, and sought for no∣thing indeed but to maintain the people in their obedience to the holy church, who if hee should but once frowne vppon them, they would all come and fal downe at his maiesties feete, and vowe their goods, their liues, and whatsoe∣uer meanes they had to doo his maiestie seruice, and therefore hee neede not feare them who were so good and deuout Catholikes, but rather had cause to animate them in their Religious proceedings, considering that they opposed themselues against none but such as were tearmed Hugonots, the kings sworne enemies, and such as had beene the occasion of all those miseries which had
<PB N="112" REF="60"/> continued in <HI>France</HI> for so many yeeres.</P>
<P>The King was brought into such a securitie of his estate by this wicked Councell, that he did not onely reiect such aduertisements as were sent to him from time to time, both from the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> Duke <HI>Cassimer,</HI> and other Princes, touching the monstrous conspiration of the Leaguers: but also as one that knew not what hee did, hee made great preparation against them of the reformed Religion, and suffered the Leaguers in the meane time to grow and fortifie themselues at their owne pleasures, vntill they were become so migh∣ty, that they thought themselues able inough, if neede were, to go through with theyr intended course, whosoeuer shoulde say nay. Which was no sooner effected, but that they sette the Kings Councellers on the sodaine to enfourme the king of the great power and puissance of the Leaguers: howe that quite besides their expectations there was an vniuersall con∣sent of all his good subiects, to restore the Catholike Religion, that great numbers of his Nobilitie and cheefest Citties highly commended the zeale of the Leaguers, and were resolued in theyr defence: and therfore that it were good for the king, considering the time, not to make any resemblance to call any of them to account for any of theyr actions, least he should giue some suspicion that hee was a fauorer of the heretikes, which might breed a grudg∣ing in the hearts of his people, wherby some commotions might rise to the im∣minent perill of his royall person, and the extreme danger of the whole state.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King maketh peace with the Lea∣guers.</NOTE>The king beeing maruailously amazed with these and such like remonstrati∣ons, thought it best to make peace with them, and to countenance them as his best subiects. They were glad that they had brought him to that passe: and now seeing they had found him so submisse, they meant to make further tryall of his courtesie, and therevppon they required that all their former actions might be ratified by the kings authoritie, as good and lawful, and done for his seruice, and that whatsoeuer had passed in preiudice of the Leaguers, should be reuo∣ked as wrongfull and vniust, and for that they sawe the king was willing to gratifie their smal requests, they were bold to proceed further, &amp; to intreat him, that the Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Maine,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Aumaile,</HI> the Cardinall of <HI>Guyse,</HI> the Lord <HI>Brissac,</HI> the Lord <HI>Antragnes,</HI> the Lord <HI>Chastre,</HI> and the rest of the principall Leaguers might haue the gouernement of sundrie the stron∣gest places of the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lea∣guers require to be made gouernours of the principall holds in France.</NOTE> as of the Cittadell of <HI>Metz,</HI> the Castle of <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, Rhemes,</HI> the strongest holds of <HI>Picardy, Orleans, Caen, Aniou, Bourges, Lyons,</HI> and many o∣thers of like importance. They further perswaded with him to proclaime open warres against the Protestants, &amp; to declare the king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and all others who had beene infected with heresie (as they tearmed it) to be for euer vncapable of any office in <HI>France,</HI> and that they should packe out of the Countrey with all speede: and for the better countenancing of all theyr proceedings against these great States, they procured Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> to excom∣municate them, thereby to make them more odious with the people.</P>
<P>As soone as they had gotten in a manner whatsoeuer they desired, and had made themselues as good maisters as the King, they with sundrie and most cunning deuises gayned great multitudes to ioyne with them, and e∣uerie man eyther for feare or for loue, was foorthwith at their will and
<PB N="113" REF="60"/> commande. They mustered great forces, and gathered mightie armies, to inuade the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> and the rest of the Protestants, who seeing them∣selues abandoned of their king, and exposed to the furie of their mercilesse enemies, stood vpon the defensiue, and resisted the rage of the League as well as they could.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> growing strong, determined to besiege <HI>Brouage,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde be∣siegeth Brou∣age.</NOTE> which was kept by the Lord Saint <HI>Luc</HI> for the Leaguers: where, after hee had spent some time in gayning many of the principall forts, he departed towards <HI>An∣giers,</HI> leauing al his footmen to continue the siege: and albeit the Prince vsed great expedition, labouring with all speede to releeue those who had taken the Castle of <HI>Angiers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince goeth to∣wards An∣giers.</NOTE> yet could hee not come time inough, for by reason that Cap∣taine <HI>Rochmort,</HI> who had surprised the saide Castle, was slaine with a shot out of the Towne as hee was leaning in his chamber window, the Castle was rende∣red again vpon composition, &amp; made sure for the League, as it was afore time. The Prince beeing ignorant hereof, passed the Loyre with all his troups, which were some eight hundred horse, and almost a thousand and two hundred har∣quebuziers on horsebacke, conducted by the Lord of <HI>Nemours, Lauall, Trimo∣uille, Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lay,</HI> Saint <HI>Gelais, Aubigny, Ouches, Rohan Touche, Flesche,</HI> and sundrie o∣thers. The Lord <HI>Clermont</HI> had likewise gathered a great companie of horse, and encamped himselfe with the Prince neere vnto <HI>Angiers.</HI> These companies ap∣proching the Towne, expected some signall from the Castle, whereby they might vnderstand that it still held for the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> but they were certi∣fied that the saide Castle was yeelded the day before into the handes of their e∣nemies, and therefore that it was lost labour to stay there any longer. Which newes greeued the Prince exceedingly, &amp; made him with the rest of his coun∣cell, to fall to consultation, how they might safely get backe ouer the Loyre, and free themselues out of that danger which then appeared before their eies: and for that they knewe well inough that both the kings forces and the Lea∣guers were vp in all quarters, and hasted by all possible meanes to encounter them, they retyred towards the Loyre with a purpose to returne the same way they came. The Lord <HI>Lauell</HI> beeing the formost, got ouer without any danger: but before the comming of the Prince, all the passages were seised by the ene∣mie, and the prince was aduertised by many messengers, that either hee must resolue to open his way by the sword, or else to hazard himselfe at al aduenture through the Countrey of <HI>Beause.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince approching the danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great distresse of the Prince and the rest of the Prote∣stants that were with him.</NOTE> and thinking that in either of these there was but hard choyse, called a Councell: but by reason of the diuersitie of opi∣nions it was long before any thing could be concluded: at length it was agreed to passe through <HI>Beause.</HI> Then euery man prepared himselfe towardes that de∣sperate iourney, and marching toward <HI>Luche</HI> in <HI>Aniou,</HI> purposed there to passe ouer the Loyre vpon the Bridge: but the Riuer was so risen, that there was no passage without imminent perill. From thence therefore they went to <HI>Lude,</HI> and so to <HI>Prillay, Vandeloyre,</HI> &amp; S. <HI>Arnol,</HI> where they heard newes that the Duke of <HI>Espernon</HI> and the Mareschall <HI>Biron</HI> were at <HI>Boneuall</HI> in <HI>Beausse,</HI> with great for∣ces, readie to fight with the dismayed multitude: that the Duke <HI>De Mayne,</HI> as on the other side of the Loyre neere vnto <HI>Bloy,</HI> readie to cut off such as should
<PB N="114" REF="61"/> fortune to passe that way, and that all the Countrey was full of strong garrisons attending with great deuotion to make a pray of the Prince, and that handfull of men which did accompanie him, so that it seemed the further they went the neerer they approched their destruction and hauing with their long and la∣borious marches wearied themselues and tired their horses, they did vtterly dispaire of any good successe. In this great agony they iourneyed on, and eue∣rie day receiued more vncomfortable newes then other, wherewith many sup∣posing that all was lost, secretly disbanded from the grosse of the Armie, and repaired to such friendes as they had in the Countrey.</P>
<P>The Prince and the rest of the Nobilitie were wonderfully perplexed, and knew not what course to take: at length they resolued to diuide themselues in∣to seuerall companies, some going one way and some another: the Lord <HI>Rohan</HI> with many Gentlemen in his retinew, went towards <HI>Britaine,</HI> Saint <HI>Gelais</HI> went towards <HI>Vandosme,</HI> the Prince, the Lords of <HI>Trimouille</HI> and <HI>Auantigny</HI> with some of their principall seruants, betooke them to their fortune as well as the rest, and hasted to get into some place of greater securitie. The laborious and tedious trauaile of this noble Prince, his wearisome courses, his long Caualca∣dos, his great and perilous dangers hee escaped before he gat to that Iland of <HI>Gernsy,</HI> would require a long discourse, &amp; were sufficient for a whole volume. As soone as the cheefetaines were thus dispersed, the common souldiers were quickly scattered, some tooke their way towards <HI>Orleance</HI> some towards <HI>No∣mandy,</HI> and some towards <HI>Mayne,</HI> and to bee short, euerie man went which way hee liked best, trauailing in exceeding great feare, hauing as they ima∣gined, neither meanes to escape nor force to resist, but were readie euerie mi∣nute to fall into the hands of those who did wholly pursue them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of Conde with the cheefest of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> troupes arriued at Rochell much about one time.</NOTE> and thirsted for nothing more then for their bloud: but when all hope failed, God did mi∣arculously deliuer them, and so deli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered them in theyr iourneyes, that hauing auoyded a million of more then apparent perils, they all arriued at length at <HI>Ro∣chell,</HI> and that much about one time, to the exceeding comfort of themselues, and the wonder of all <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>The king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> knowing that all this was doone by the procurement of the League and the Popish Clergie, seised likewise vppon all the Landes, and goods of such as were either Leaguers or fauourers of that factious and rebellious multitude. The seuere proclamations made by the king against those of the Reformed Churches, wrought many lamentable effects in the Land. Some who made profession of the Gospel recanted, and turned to Poperie, and because they would not bee suspected on any dissimulation, they became earnest persecutors of their poore brethren. Others hid them∣selues in secret corners and liued most miserably and in great wants.

<P>The Duke <HI>de Maine</HI> did all this while what hee could to any the Prote∣stants, and to gayne as many Citties and townes (through very secrecie) as hee could to ioyne with the League, and to make that faction strong against the King, by seducing his subiects vnder the colour of maintaining the Ca∣tholike Religion. Which beeing suspected by sundrie his followers, they disbanded themselues, and some for want of pay refused to serue any longer.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Maine</HI> by reason of these vnexpected crosses, was not able to make head any longer, and therefore wrote to the <HI>Guyse</HI> his brother in what bad tearmes things stood, who fearing that if there were not new prouision, that his brother the Duke <HI>de Maine,</HI> would come shortly to ruyne, and bee vtterly ouerthrowne, aduised the king to make foure seuerall Armies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure newe armies ap∣pointed to inuade the Protestants.</NOTE> and to inuade the protestants in diuerse places at once, which (sayde hee) was the onely way to weaken them, considering that their forces should bee seuered and disioyned.</P>
<P>This pollicie was no sooner allowed as the best, but the Mareschall <HI>Biron</HI> was appointed to go into <HI>Xainctoigne,</HI> the Duke <HI>Ioyeuse</HI> into <HI>Languedocke,</HI> the Lord <HI>Foynse</HI> his sonne into <HI>Auergne,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Espernon</HI> into <HI>Pro∣uence.

<P>The king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> was foorthwith certified of this preparation, which made him fortifie such places as were of importance as strongly as hee could, and vnderstanding that the Mareschall <HI>Biron</HI> intended to besiege <HI>Browage,</HI> with a power of one thousand &amp; two hundred horse &amp; foure thousand footmen, he did so carefully prouide for the defence therof, that after that <HI>Biron</HI> had bin long

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He French King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1588</HI> The army of the Germains commaunded by the Duke of Bonillon.</NOTE> and Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> were all this while verie busie in prouiding of all necessarie meanes to withstande the Germaines, who still came on forwardes. Their armie con∣sisted of fiue thousand Ruttars, fiue thousand Lancequenets, sixteene thousand Switzers, with whom were ioyned foure thousand French harquebuziers, and three hundred French horse. The Lord <HI>Mouy</HI> brought also two thousand French harquebuziers on horsebacke, the Lord <HI>Villeneufe</HI> one thousand, and the Lorde <HI>Louers</HI> one thousand. The Lord <HI>Chastillon</HI> likewise ioined with them, with one thousand fiue hundred harquebuziers, and two hundred horses. The whole number came to some thirtie fiue thousand: besides the companies brought by the Prince of <HI>Contie.</HI> They had sixteene peeces of great Ordinance, with store of all warlike munition. The general of all these, was the Duke of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> who commaunded as Lieutenant for the King of <HI>Nauarre.</HI></P>
<P>This mightie and puyssant armie was the terrour of the League, and the hope of the Protestants, but the expectation of both was disappoynted: for after that the Germaines had marched through <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and were gotten in∣to <HI>Fraunce</HI> as farre as <HI>Lancy</HI> in <HI>Masconois,</HI> where by reason that manie principall Captaines were corrupted with money and fayre promises, and the rest suffe∣red great wants, they concluded to returne backe: so that hauing made their capitulation, and gotten theyr Passeportes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundry of the Germaine Captains cor∣rup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by mo¦ny caused the whole armie to retire. The death of the duke of Bonillon.</NOTE> euerie man made all the speede home that might bee, loden with miserie, shame, and dishonour, with the losse of many Ensignes and Cornets, besides their chiefest leaders and commaun∣ders. The Duke of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> generall of that armie, with the Lord <HI>Clerebant</HI> and <HI>Van,</HI> being not able to draw them forwards by any perswasion, returned to <HI>Ge∣neua,</HI> where they died shortly after: The Count <HI>de La Marke,</HI> brother to the duke of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> was deceased long before at a place called <HI>Loyne.</HI> Great numbers of this dispersed armie were inuaded by their enemies, and slaine in their passage homewards, contrarie to the promise which had beene made vnto them by the Catholiques. The Colonels and Captaines of the Switzers, the chiefe authours of the dissolution of that Armie, were seuerely punished by their <HI>Segneuries,</HI> so that this whole armie was maruellously afflicted, and euerie one was scour∣ged after one sort or other: and hauing spent and spoyled infinitely, did nothing but worke their owne calamitie and ouerthrow.</P>
<P>The King vndoubtedly had taken maruellous care to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uer this mightie puyssaunce, and by cunning handling of the matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guises slaunder the King.</NOTE> had brought them to this extreame passe, that vnder the colour of a Passeport, hee exposed them to the butcherie, and rage of their enemies. And although that by reason of
<PB N="120" REF="64"/> this politique dealing, he deserued high commendation: yet the <HI>Guise</HI> so hand∣led the matter, that all redownded to his further discredite, and caused his sub∣iects to speake worse of him then at anie time before. For the <HI>Guise</HI> had caused it to bee bruited abroad, that not onely the King had willingly suffered the Ger∣maines to escape, contrarie to the counsaile and aduice of the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> but also had giuen them the meanes to retyre in safetie, some into <HI>Germanie,</HI> and others into <HI>Languedocke,</HI> there to ioyne with the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and so to con∣tinue further troubles in the lande, to the great and intollerable harme of the good Catholiques, and the encouraging of Heretikes, and such as were ene∣mies to holy Chuch.</P>
<P>When the Friers and Iesuits in <HI>Paris,</HI> and other principall cities were possessed with these newes, they brake forth into very seditious speeches, openly exclay∣ming against the King, and extolling the wisdome, prowesse &amp; noble acts of the duke of <HI>Guise:</HI> whereby they procured him much fauor among the multitude that knew nothing, but what they heard by the Leaguers, and their fauorites, which made them think, that the King had killed his thousand, but the <HI>Guise</HI> his ten thousand. All which treacherous dealings tended to no other end but this: either to make the French beleeue that the K. was not indowed with such noble and heroycall vertues, as were requisite for him that should gouerne so mightie and puissant a nation, or else that he was a notorious dissembler, a maintainer of Heretikes, &amp; a secret enemy to the Catholikes. And then what should they doo with such a King? let thē make choise of another more valiant, more wise, more prouident, more religious, &amp; a more stout defender of holy Church: and who should that be, but the <HI>Guise,</HI> who for the zeale, courage, valour, and singuler dexteritie in the mannaging of matters of estate, was not onely superior to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The leaguers attempt a∣gainst the yong duches of Bonillon.</NOTE> but the paragon of all Europe.</P>
<P>The leaguers being assured of the death of the duke of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> and that hee had left his sister Madame <HI>Charlate de la Marke,</HI> a yong and tender Ladie, heyre to all his soueraigne segneurie, and principalitie of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> thought it their best to let the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> alone for a time, at whose handes there was little to bee gotten, vnlesse they payed deare for it, and to enterprise somewhat a∣agaynst this desolate Ladie, and either by hooke or by crooke (as wee vse to say) to get the Dukedome into their possession. VVhereupon the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> vsed all the cunning hee coulde, to match his sonne the Prince <HI>Ien∣uill</HI> with her: and the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> was as earnest a suter for his sonne, called <HI>Marthuis de Pont,</HI> and Lorde <HI>Vaudemont.</HI> But neither of them being able by all their deuises, to winne that Ladies fauour, they thought it best to ioyne together, and to compell her to match according to their lykings. With this resolution they entered the Dukedome of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> with a great power, burning, wasting, killing, murthering, rauishing, and committing all o∣ther horrible and detestable villanies that coulde bee imagined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The crueltie of the lea∣guers against the dukedom of Bonillon.</NOTE> and besieged the sayde Ladie, and her two principall Townes, <HI>Sedan</HI> and <HI>Iamets:</HI> where they continued a long tyme, spent much Treasure, and lost most of theyr men, and in the ende, with shame and dishonour, (beeing well beaten at a womans hand, by the valiant conduct of the Lord <HI>Necuile,</HI>) were glad to giue ouer, and returne home.</P>
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>
<P>Whilest the dukedom of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> was vexed and tormented with these trou∣blesome sutors, the principal leagers assembled at <HI>Nancie</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> where there was a great consultation helde, how they might aduance themselues, and ouer∣thow the King, against whose person and state they had for a long time bout all their endeuors. There they agreed to present certain articles to the king, which they would haue him agree vnto: and those were such as tended to the vtter de∣struction of the King, and the auncient Nobilitie of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and the safetie of themselues. First, they requested the King to ioyne more openly with the League, and to put all such as they dislyked out of their offices:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The petitions of the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue to the king.</NOTE> To cause the Councell of <HI>Trent</HI> to bee proclaymed throughout all his Dominions: To establish the Spanish inquisition: To put such Castels and strong Townes into their handes, as they should name vnto him: That hee shoulde sende an armie into <HI>Lorraine,</HI> vpon the borders of <HI>G rmanie,</HI> to let the entrie of strangers into the land, and for the maintenance thereof, should cause all the goods of those, whome they tearmed Heretikes or fauourers of Heretikes, to bee solde, and the money to bee deliuered into theyr handes. That the Catholiques shoulde pay the tenth of their reuenewes for the same purpose: and that the surplussage shoulde bee to pay the most needfull debts of the principall Lea∣guers, and that the life of no Heretike prisoner, shoulde be spared, vnlesse hee would abiure, and put in good securitie to liue Catholiquely hereafter, and to giue all his goods, or the iust valew of them, which hee hath then in his pos∣session, to the supporting of the League, and to binde himselfe to serue three yeares, wheresoeuer he should be commaunded.</P>
<P>The King did allowe of such of these Articles as did any way concerne the suppression of the reformed Religion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king re∣fuseth to grant all the petitions of the league.</NOTE> but considering that the rest did wonderfull derogate from his Crowne and dignitie, and that they tended directlie to the weakening of himselfe, and the strengthening of the league, of which, for a long tyme, hee had verie hardly conceyued, hee would not bee enduced to condiscend vnto them, by anie manner of meanes or entreatie whatsoeuer.</P>
<P>Now as the Leaguers laboured openly by these and such like deuises, to weaken the King, so they practised secretly to destroy the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> knowing that if they were once ridde of them, it woulde bee an easie matter to accomplish the rest. Heerevpon they set on worke certaine wicked and diuellish persons, to bring these two great Princes to their deaths. And assuring themselues that this detestable deuise woulde take effect, they caused it on a suddaine to bee bruited all ouer the Realme of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> that <HI>Na∣uarre</HI> and <HI>Conde</HI> were both dead. But by Gods good prouidence, <HI>Nauarre</HI> esca∣ped that daunger, and tooke no harme.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> by the treacherous and villaynous dealing of some of his housholde seruaunts, and amongest others, of one <HI>Brillant,</HI> and a page,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prince of Conde poy∣soned.</NOTE> (two such as he had greatly fauoured, and bestowed many benefites vpon) was poisoned the third day of March, in the yere of our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great commendatiō of the prince of Conde.</NOTE> one thousand fiue hū∣dred eightie and eight, and died within two dayes after, at Saint <HI>Iean d' Angely.</HI> Whose death was greatly lamented of all good men, for that hee was wise, valiant, zealous in religion, true harted to his Prince, a louer of his country, and
<PB N="122" REF="65"/> an irreconciliable enemie to the perturbers of the state, and to all such as hee knewe to be aduersaries to God, to the King, and to the Crowne of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Guises</HI> and the rest of the leaguers, reioysed not a little at this newes: for nowe they thought they were gotten one steppe higher, and had greater hope to oppresse the Protestants then before: who they knewe were migh∣tily weakened with this losse. And for that they supposed that in this conser∣uation of mens mindes, they had oportunitie to attempt something, which might still aduaunce their affaires, they thought good that the Lorde <HI>Lauerdin,</HI> who had scaped a scowring at the battaile of <HI>Coutras,</HI> should assaile <HI>Marans,</HI> a place of very great importaunce, and if it were possible to make it sure for the league.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Lauerdin</HI> applied his businesse so diligently, that he gayned the sayd Island of <HI>Marans</HI> in a short time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marans gained by the Lord Lauer∣din.</NOTE> by reason that the Protestants, being amased (as it were) with the vnexpected death of the Prince, did not prouide timelie enough for the fortifying thereof, with such store of men and munition, as was necessarie.</P>
<P>Albeit that the King was glad, that the Lord <HI>Lauerdin</HI> had gotten <HI>Marans,</HI> yet he liked not that it should be kept by the Lord <HI>Cluseaux,</HI> whom he knewe to bee a fauourer of the League: but there was no remedie, he must beare with the time, being indeede not able to doe as hee would, for the most part of his Councell, and those of the chiefest were leagers, and the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> the head of those monsters, had caused such infamous rumours to be raysed of the Kings actions, and by secret practises had so disgraced him among his subiects, that he was almost growne into contempt among the communaltie, and was imputed no bodie in comparison of the <HI>Guise.</HI> This opinion the King would gladly haue rooted out, and was verie desirous to gaine their good willes and affections, if possibly he might. The better to effect this, he thought best to proclaime wars afresh against the Protestants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King prepareth to go into Poictou a∣gainst the Protestants.</NOTE> and to rayse a great power, and to go in person in∣to <HI>Poictou,</HI> agaynst the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and all his confederates, that so by some famous exploits against those of the reformed religion, hee might regaine the loue and liking of his lost subiects.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> who knew that he had stollen away the peoples hearts from the King, thought it now good time to discouer his secrete meaning more openly, and presuming of his fauourers at Court, and the good wil of the coun∣trey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guise determineth to seise vpon Paris, and to take the King.</NOTE> concludeth to get <HI>Paris,</HI> to seise vpon the king either aliue or dead, to kill as many princes of the blood, and other officers of the crown as he could lay hands vpon, and by fine force to set the diadem of <HI>France</HI> vpon his owne head. Now that he might be the more assured to accomplish all this, he wrote secret letters to all his chiefe friends and followers, to meete him at <HI>Paris,</HI> as spedily as they might. And for that the King should not be able to withstand him, he had set the duke of <HI>Aumaile</HI> to warre against sundry townes and cities in <HI>Picardy,</HI> and had gi∣uen order that others should attempt as much in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and other places: knowing that the king would send thither his principall forces to keepe those countries in his obedience, and then he might with more facilitie execute his intended purpose.</P>
<P>Vpon these aduertisements of the <HI>Guise</HI> to his associates, there repayred

<P>Not long after his arriuall, he went very confidently to see the king, and with all humble reuerence with his knee to the ground, saluted him: but the king being highly despleased for that his comming, contrary to his commandement, gaue him a frowning countenance. The <HI>Guyse</HI> stayed not long at Court but re∣turned to his house in the Citie: immediatly after, the King being duely enfor∣med of the great number of strangers that were in the same Cittie, and that it was verie likely that they remained there for some dangerous exploit, caused twelue companies of French men and Switzers to bee distributed into sundrie places to keepe all quiet and in their due obedience.

<PB N="124" REF="66"/> went after him as fast as they could, some on horsebacke, and some on foote, making as good shift as they could vpon so short warning: wherein wee may note a maruailous strange alteration and vicissitude in the state of this great Prince, who hauing beene so mightie a monarke, and a king of two such noble and puissant countreyes as were <HI>Polonia</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> a commander ouer so many great and honourable personages, and had ruled such an infinite multitude of all sorts, was now driuen out of his owne house, and out of his cheefest Citie, and forced to flie before him who was his vassaile and subiect, to his intollera∣ble greefe and vexation, leauing his treasure and whatsoeuer precious things he had, to be a pray for his enemies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guyse</HI> vnderstanding that the king was escaped, and had auoyded his bloudy fingers, was maruailously greeued, and cursed his ouersight, knowing that hee should neuer haue the like oportunitie againe to effect his purpose, and fearing that the King would seeke to be reuenged of so great an indignitie offered to his person, thought that hee would prouide the meanes as wel as he could, to defende himself and his: &amp; therfore he seised vpon the Kings arsemall, and vpon his treasor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guyse seiseth vppon the Kings treasor.</NOTE> whereof hee brought to his owne house aboue seauen hundred thousand Crownes, which hee laide vp as an earnest for the rest. Then did he forthwith alter the pollicie of the Citie, remoouing <HI>Perrense</HI> the prouost of the Merchants from his office, and the rest of the cheefest officers which he knew to be affectionate to the king, and placed such as were the most factious &amp; seditious Leaguers in their roumes: he wrote also sundry letters to his friēds abroad, and to the principall Townes such as he knew to bee deuoted to him, requiring them to ioyne with him, and to be in a readinesse when hee should haue neede, and caused it to be bruted, that all that which had passed at <HI>Paris</HI> was not against the king, but to defend the Cittie which was in danger to bee spoyled by strangers, and that the king by the counsell of the Duke of <HI>Espernon,</HI> who had (said he) intelligence with the King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> and the Heretikes, had caused sundrie gibbets to be set vp in seueral places of the Citie, to hang diuers Cittizens and to spoyle their houses, thereby to gather money, and to warre against the Leaguers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guyse seeketh to co∣uer his rebel∣lious action.</NOTE>When the <HI>Guyse</HI> had taken the course to assure himselfe by all the deuises hee could, hee wrote letters to the king, seeking to disguyse all this action, and to perswade him, that hee had no euill meaning against his maiestie, but had al∣waies beene and still remained his most dutifull subiect, and had in this tumul∣tuous stirre, happened at <HI>Paris,</HI> shewed how hee respected the King and all his seruants, in that hee had taken so great prayes euen with the danger of his life to saue sundrie his officers, his Captaines and Souldiers, and so farre forth as possibly he might, to keep the people from murther and blouds<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, which was then so likely to haue fallen out, and that to the great and irreperable harme of the Kings best affected subiects. After the alleaging of these and ma∣ny other arguments to proue his fidelitie, he besought the king to be his graci∣ous Lord, and to account of him as his most faithfull and loyall s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>biect, and for that hee had a guiltie conscience, hee was continually in feare, least the King would at one time or other bee reuenged, howsoeuer peraduenture for the time hee might dissemble the matter, and shew him a fayre countenance, and

Such was his demeanor, and so cunningly hee handled the matter, that she was woon to be a mediator for him, and to assay to bring him againe into the kings fauor.</P>
<P>The king reposing a maruailous confidence in his mother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen mother re∣concileth the Guyse to the King.</NOTE> who had be∣witched him with an opinion of her loue and naturall affection towards him, suffered himselfe to be ruled by her aduice, notwithstanding all the perswa∣sions of the Catholikes that were about him, who exclaimed against the <HI>Guy∣ses</HI> and their proude and rebellious enterprises, and required the king to ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e condigne punishment, proffering him their seruice, their liues, theyr goods, and whatsoeuer meanes they had for the accomplishment thereof. The king thanked them for their good willes, but resoluing to make a peace, sent them home againe, and would not follow their counsels. After much going and comming on both sides, the reconciliation was made, &amp; the K. &amp; the Leaguers became good friendes, and intended to bend all their forces against the Prote∣stants. Wherupon two mighty armies were prepared, the one for <HI>Guyen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two armies sent against the Prote∣stants.</NOTE> com∣manded by the Duke of <HI>Neuers,</HI> &amp; the other for <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> vnder the leading of the Duke <HI>de Maine.</HI> All these troublous stirs being now ended, &amp; the K. and the Leaguers beeing made friends, it was thought good to call an assembly of the state to reforme the pollicie of the Land, and to take some finer course for the prosecuting of the warres against the Hugonots, and to that ende the king sent his writs to summon all prouinces, Cities, and townes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Parli∣ament was appointed to begin the <HI>15.</HI> of Au∣gust, yet af∣terward it was deferred vntill the ninth of Oc∣tober follow∣ing.</NOTE> to send their deputies to <HI>Bloys,</HI> prouided alwaies that they were good Catholiks, and such as neither had fauour, nor were any waies suspected to fauour the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> nor his as∣sociats, and the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> and the rest of the Leaguers so handled the mat∣ter in the meane time, that not any one man in a maner was chosen to be sent to that assembly, but such as they were assured did either openly or secretly fauor their proceedings.</P>
<P>At this great Parleament there was much adoo and many things talked of, but especially of the Edict of <HI>Reunion,</HI> made the one and twentie of Iuly, which tended to the establishing of Poperie, the rooting out of Heresie, and the dis∣inheriting of the Princes of the bloud, prouoking the king with many bitter words &amp; vehemēt exhortations, to embrew his hāds in the bloud of the saints, and with fire and sword to roote them out of <HI>France.</HI> All which was assented vnto by the king and his three estates, &amp; enacted as a fundamentall law of the land, which they all swore to see inuiolably kept, and obserued in al the kings dominions, to the vttermost of their powers.</P>
<P>The king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> was quickly aduertised of whatsoeuer had passed at <HI>Bloys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣stants assem∣ble at Rochel</NOTE> and therfore assembled all his principall friends &amp; followers at <HI>Rochel,</HI> the 16. of Nouember following, whither likewise all the reformed churches sent theyr deputies: where they resolued vppon the defensiue, and the meanes how to withstand their enemies. The king continued at <HI>Bloys</HI> all this while, and albeit hee shewed a faire countenance to the <HI>Guyse,</HI> yet in heart hee loued him not, for that indignitie which was offered him at <HI>Paris,</HI> besides many other sau∣cie and audacious Pranks which hee plaide since, did breed a reuenging minde in the K. which he meant to shew more apparantly assoone as any oportunity was offered. Now as it vsually falleth out betweene late reconciled enemies,
<PB N="126" REF="67"/> each still suspected other, and many tarres <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell out betweene their friendes and followers, which bred sundrie sturres and hurleburlies in the Court: but there were two especially which gaue the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>larum to the Courtiers, and made euerie man to stand vpon his guard. The first quarrell arose among the Pages and lackies, some holding with the Burbons, and some with the Leaguers, wherewith the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> was so affrighted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sodain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vprares at Court.</NOTE> that hee ran into his chamber, barred the doores, and kept himselfe as close as he could.

<P>About the middle of December, the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> shewed himselfe more disobedient then at any time before, and a great contemner of the king and his authoritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guyse a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ter of murthe∣rers and Re∣bels.</NOTE> in maintaining a number of Ruffians, murtherers, factious &amp; sedi∣tious persons, and such as raised a rebellion in August last, and had attempted the killing of the Duke of <HI>Espernan</HI> at <HI>Engolesme.</HI> These were lodged in the Court, and flocked about the <HI>Guyse,</HI> and were so countenanced by him, that no Magistrate durst say a word to them: besides, the king being daily enformed of many trech erous practises against his person and estate, called al his Nobles, and willed them to sweare, that they should neuer attempt any thing against him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guyse refuseth to take his oath for the pre∣seruation of the King.</NOTE> the Duke most disloyally refused, and said in his presence, that he would not take such an oath, and if hee did any thing otherwise then he ought, there were good lawes to punish him, spare him not no other answere could bee gottten at his hands, and fearing that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing would be reuenged as well for this as for other notorious contempts, as also considering that all the drifts of his councellers were so discouered, that there was no way to hide them anie longer, and therefore that now with all speede hee must put them in executi∣on, hee called a Councell of his most trusty friends, as <HI>Lewis</HI> Cardinall of <HI>Guyse</HI> his brother, the Archbishop of <HI>Lyons,</HI> and some fewe others, in which it was concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guyse and his asso∣ciats vow to kill the king.</NOTE> that the king must needes bee dispatched out of hand, and that all delaies were dangerous: and therefore the twentie foure of that moneth was appointed for that tragical execution, binding themselues to see the same per∣formed with a solemne oath.</P>
<P>Thus was this great french king discouered of a very auncient and noble race, honoured for a long time of his owne subiects, and reuerenced of his neighbour Princes, condemned to die by the hands of most disloyall traytors, who had all their aduauncement by him and his predecessors.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hough the King knew not of this sentence of death which was pronounced against him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King resolueth to kill the Guyse.</NOTE> yet the olde and new iniuries offered vnto him by the <HI>Guyse,</HI> did sufficiently exasperate him, and made him watch all opportunitie to seeke his reuenge, and assoone as euer he could to be ridde of so desperate a traytor. This deter∣mination of the king could not be kept so secret, but that the <HI>Guyse</HI> hauing many friends about the king, who suspected some such thing, aduertised the Duke the two and twenty of December, by laying a little bill vnder his napkin, wher∣in was written: <HI>Looke to your selfe for some are about to play a shrewd play with you.</HI> Hee perusing the writing, wrote this answere: <HI>They dare not,</HI> and so threw it vnder the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able. The same day the king receiued diuers aduertisements of this horrible conspiracie of the <HI>Guyse</HI> against his person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aduer∣tisements of the Duke of Maine and Aumaile to the King, touching the attempt of the Guyse.</NOTE> and especially from the Duke <HI>de Maine,</HI> who sent <HI>Alphonso Corse</HI> to him with this message. <HI>That it was an easie matter to carrie beades about, and to put on a counterfeit shew of holinesse, but hee was sure that his brother had a dangerous enterprise in hand against his Maiestie, which he knew not certainely when hee would put in execution, but hee was well assured that the time was not farre off, and that hee doubted least his warning should come too late.</HI> And aduised him in these words, <HI>That his Maiestie should beware of a desperate and fu∣rious mind.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Aumaile</HI> sent likewise the duchesse his Wife to giue the King to vnderstand, <HI>That there was great danger towards his person, and that the con∣spirators were vpon the poynt of execution.</HI> The king had also intercepted manie letters, by which hee did euidently perceiue as much, and how that the Guy∣ses had sworne his death and destruction, and disinhereting of the royall bloud of <HI>France</HI> in the houses of <HI>Valoys</HI> and <HI>Burbons,</HI> and to sette vppe the house of <HI>Lorraine.</HI></P>
<P>All these remonstrances made the king bestirre him, and to deuise some spee∣die Course for the preseruation of his owne life. Wherupon he got the keyes of the Castle, doubled his guards, and appointed a strong watch in the Town, with commaundement not to open the gates without his speciall lisence: all which was doone in the night, without the knowledge of the <HI>Guyse,</HI> and cal∣ling vnto him some seauen or eight of those fiue and fortie pensioners which daily attended on his person, hee reuealed vnto them his purpose, requiring theyr ayde and assistance, who receiued most willingly their seruice, with promise to execute his will, and to doo as his Maiestie had directed them.</P>
<P>The next morning the Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> the Cardinall his brother, the Archbi∣shop of <HI>Lyons</HI> with the Mareschall of <HI>Haultmont</HI> were assembled in the chamber neere vnto the king, and readie to sit in councell howe and in what manner it were best to commit their detestable parricide. The king hauing disposed of all things in the best manner that hee could deuise, sent a Gentleman to call
<PB N="124" REF="68"/> the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> to come and speake with him, who comming forth, and see∣ing the Guards more carefully disposed then was accustomed, hauing a guiltie conscience, beganne to suspect, and (as oftentimes the minde of man vppon the instant of so great aduentures presageth that which afterward ensueth) so at this present the Dukes hart fainted, and his colour charged, &amp; as one fearing some imminent perill, hee was readie to swound: hee had sent his Page for a handkercheffe, in one of the corners whereof his secretarie named <HI>Pellicart</HI> had knit vp a little written bill, containing a warning to get him away with all speede, or else he were but dead. But this handkercheffe was intercepted with the remembrance, as the Page was comming vppe, and neuer came to his handes.</P>
<P>The Duke in going through a narrow passage to the King, encreased his mis∣trust, and was about to returne, but still hee went forwards into the Kings vt∣ter chamber, where seeing the Lord <HI>Loiguake</HI> fitting vpon a chest, whom of all other he most hated, for that he had beene long perswaded that the same Lord determined to kill him, hee set his hand to his sword with a purpose to set vp∣pon the sayde <HI>Loiguake:</HI> but by reason hee did weare his Cloake Scarft wise, he was so troubled, that he could not draw it past halfe way out of the sheath: they who were appoynted for his execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of Francis D. of Guyse.</NOTE> seeing him enterprise such an au∣dacious act and that at the kings chamber doore, preuented him and slew him at that instant.</P>
<P>The noyse was such in this tragicall execution, that the Cardinall entred into a mistrust, and made hast to get forth, but he was stayed by a Gentleman of the Scottish guard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of the Cardi¦nall of Guise</NOTE> who had commandement to arrest him, and not long af∣ter by reason of his former treasons and his presumptuous behauiour at that present, mingled with some threatning speeches, hee was strangled in the same placce where hee was taken prisoner. The Archbishop rushed foorth in great furie, and saide hee would helpe the Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> but hee was quickly cooled and clapt vp in prison, though afterwarde released vppon his submission and acknowledgement of his offence. The Cardinall of <HI>Burbon,</HI> the Prince <HI>Ieuuille</HI> sonne to the Duke of <HI>Guyse,</HI> the Mareschall <HI>D'Albenfe,</HI> with many other pertakers in this treason, were apprehended and committed to safe keeping, and likewise <HI>Pellicart</HI> secretarie to the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> with all his papers and writings, whereby all the secret Councelles of the Guyses and the rest of the Leaguers, as well of Princes and Nobles as of the Clergie, Towne, and Cities, were manifested and discouered.</P>
<P>The fame of this execution was foorthwith spread abroade in the Towne, albeit the Castle gates were shut, which made all such as had guiltie con∣sciences to packe from <HI>Bloys</HI> as speedily as euer did the Protestants from the suburbs of Saint <HI>Germaines</HI> on <HI>Bartholmew day,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guy∣sards flie from Bloys.</NOTE> and to seeke to shift for them∣selues some other where.</P>
<P>Thus were the Leaguers wonderfully crossed in their designements, and many who the day before thought it an honour to bee called Guysards and were readie to challenge to the Combate, such as reputed them Royalles were now altered on the sodaine, and cast in a newe mould, esteeming all that factious multitude worse then theeues and murtherers.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1589"/> <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He King thought good to aduertise all his subiects of that which had happened at <HI>Blois,</HI> and for that purpose wrote di∣uerse Letters to his seuerall gouernors of his prouinces, duly enforming them of al these occurrences: and sent to the assem∣bly of the States, to let them vnderstande, that it was his pleasure, that they should still continue: and that he was ful∣ly determined to followe their reasonable counsailes in all things: but they by little and little slyding away one after another, got them home into their Countryes: and by spreading of most accursed and damnable rumours, deprauing the Kings fact with many hyperbolicall speeches, which they amplified with sundry lying reasons, and defamatorie libels, tearming this execution by the name of the massacre committed at <HI>Blois,</HI> caused an vniuer∣sall rebellion of all those Townes, Cities, and Prouinces, which had reiected the Gospel in former tymes.

With this resolution hee left <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> and hasted into <HI>Burgundie,</HI> and <HI>Champaigne,</HI> taking with him such strength and power as hee could get, and making sure as manie places as hee coulde come by, prepared to make warre agaynst the king.</P>

Most of the greatest, ry∣chest, and strongest Cityes, as <HI>Orleance, Roan, Amiens, Aniou, Lyons, Abe∣uille, Remes, Tholous,</HI> and manie others, followed the example of the Parisians,
<PB N="130" REF="69"/> and conspiring with the rest of the Leaguers, imprisoned the Kings friendes, seyzed vpon his strong holdes, robbed him of his treasure, and vsed him in all outragious and rebellious maner.</P>
<P>The King vnderstanding of all these seditious sturres, sought by faire meanes and in gentle maner, to reduce them to their obedience, sending out his proclai∣mations to pardon whatsoeuer was past, and to burie it in the graue of obli∣uion, so that they woulde lay downe their Armes, and liue peaceablie vn∣der his authoritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seditious diuinitie of the Sorbo∣nists.</NOTE> as in dutie they were bound: but they made no reckoning of the Kinges clemencie, but tearmed it cowardlinesse, as though hee were afrayed of their forces, beeing animated by the Sorbonists, and their Doctours in Theologie, who had resolued that they were set free from theyr oath of o∣bedience, and former allegiaunce made vnto <HI>Henrie</HI> the thirde.

<P>The king had often and very seriously disswaded them from this seditious course, and with all lenitie sought to reduce them to their former obedience: but considering that he preuailed nothing by gentlenesse, and clemency, but ra∣ther that the people waxed worse &amp; worse, he therfore now determined to take a sharper course, and by force to bring them vnder his obedience, but fearing his owne weaknesse, and want of sufficient power to bring his purposes to passe for that he was, as it were cōpassed about with his enemies, not knowing what
<PB N="131" REF="69"/> to doo, or whome to trust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king maketh peace with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Nauarre,</NOTE> perceyuing that the most of those who were a∣bout him, were fauorers of the rebels, hee was content to follow the aduice of his most trustie councellors, and to make peace with the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and to vse his counsal and forces for his iust and lawfull defence: and the rather for that the Duke <HI>de Maine</HI> approched verie neare vnto him, with a great and puissant ar∣mie. Thus was the king for the safetie of his person, forced to cast himselfe into the armes of him, whom for manie yeares hee had reputed for his mortall ene∣mie, and glad to seeke to be preserued by such an one, whose destruction he had sought with all extremitie.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> being aduertised of the Kings intent, and solicited by sundry messengers to come to his ayde with all expedition, called his Nobles and Captaines, and gathered all his forces together, and passing ouer the <HI>Loyre</HI> at <HI>Samnur,</HI> went towards the King, who was greatly distressed at <HI>Toures,</HI> and in imminent perill, to bee oppressed by the Leaguers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meeting of the King of France, &amp; the King of Nauarre.</NOTE> The King vnderstan∣ding of his approach, the thirtie of Aprill sent the Mareschall <HI>Haultmont,</HI> ac∣companied with a great number of the Nobilitie, to desire him to come to <HI>Ple∣sis de Tours:</HI> where hee with all his Court staid for him.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> readily obeyed, passing ouer the bridge of Saint <HI>Sa∣phorin,</HI> where hee left all his forces in battaile array, and went towardes the King, whom hee sound staying for him in the Parke of <HI>Plessis.</HI> There was such a concourse of people, and so great a throng, that the two Kings were forced to stay aboue halfe a quarter of an houre, stretching and holding out their hands before they could embrace one another: so great was the prease, and such a multitude were slocked togither, to beholde this ioyfull and blessed meeting. The kind embracings and louing salutations betweene these two Potentates, did euidently declare their inward ioy &amp; contentation. The reioy∣sing of all sorts was incredible: nothing was heard for the space of halfe an houre but God saue the King: a voyce which had not beene heard neare the Court in more then foure Moneths before. And reiterating their ioyfull accla∣mations, they ceased not but cryed out, God saue the Kings, God saue the King, and the King of <HI>Nauarre.</HI></P>
<P>Here wee may see a straunge and maruailous alteration on the sudden: for these two Princes which had beene so bitter enemies, each hauing for a long time pursued other by cruell and bloodie warres, are now reconciled, and are become louing and kind friends. And the king, who not long before stoode in daunger, either to be murthered, or else to be deliuered into the hands of those, who thirsted for nothing more then for his blood, is now freed from all feare, and restored to his former libertie: and is fortifyed by the arryuall of this Prince and Armie, which did both countenaunce his authoritie, and encou∣rage his friendes, and so daunted his enemyes, that the Duke <HI>de Maine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke de Maine hasteth to Paris.</NOTE> was glad to giue ouer his siege before <HI>Chasteaurenault,</HI> and so retire to <HI>Paris</HI> with all speede.</P>
<P>The two kings sate often in councell about their affaires, deuising of the best means to prosecute their warres for their most aduantage. The king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> made many roades into the Countrie, to the great domage and hurt of the Leaguers, and so scoured the coast that no enemie durst once appeare in sight.
<PB N="132" REF="70"/> In the meane while the king receiued certaine Regiments of Switzers, and help came from all parts of his Realme: so that his armie dayly encreased in number, fame and power.

<P>The king seeing their obstinacy, followed his course, and knowing the Ci∣tie to bee very populous, and nothing well prouided for so many moneths, de∣termined to take all the passages, and to blocke in the Parisians so sure, that they should come by no victuals, making choyse to vanquish them rather by famin then by the sword, as the safest way to punish his enimies, and to saue his friends.

<P>When the Duke <HI>da Maine</HI> who was still attending vppon the Duke of <HI>Par∣ma,</HI> was aduertised of the great and extreme penury that was among the Pa∣risians, as also of the vprores and murtherings of the people, hee wrote letters

Nowe as the Leaguers within the town begā to be punished with many miseries, &amp; the famin daily encreased to the destruction of many so penury and want of necessaries began to creepe in among the kings souldiers, and by reason it was in the extreme of the Winter, many perished with cold, and great numbers fel into very sore &amp; greeuous dis∣eases: notwithstanding, the siege was still continued, and all the politike deuises that might be put in practise to gaine the citie.

The King sought all the opportunitie that might be to fight with the Duke, and offered many skirmishes to drawe him there∣to, but hee knowing fortune to bee very inconstant, and in the warres e∣specially to bee most wauering and vncertayne, vtterly refused to hazard all vppon a Battaile, and vnderstanding that there was some scarcitie
<PB N="143" REF="75"/> in the kings campe, and that it was impossible that so great a multitude shoulde bee long kept togither in a Countrey so exceedingly wasted, where there were no meanes to relieue their wants, kept himselfe close, and sought to wearie his enemies by his long delaies.</P>
<P>The K. daily braued the Spaniards in the face, &amp; dared them by many indig∣nities to come to handy strokes: which made the Duke resolue to do somwhat, albeit he were sickly and most vnwilling to fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke would not bee drawne to an entire fight.</NOTE> supposing that if hee shoulde not stirre vpon so many prouocations, his enemies would waxe more couragi∣ous, and himselfe with all his Spaniards should lose much of their wonted ho∣nor &amp; reputation. Whereupon he determined to encounter with the kings for∣ces, and to make some triall of the courage and resolution of his enemies: yet so warily, that he would be sure not to bring himselfe and his souldiers to a set bat∣tell, but by some light conflict to maintain his honor: and by a Spanish brauado, to make the world beleeue, that hee did but little esteeme of the king, and all his forces. Whereupon euery thing being in a readinesse, and hauing encouraged his troupes with sundry perswasions, the signall was no sooner giuen, but there began a sharpe and cruel fight, which hastened the death of many braue and va∣liant souldiers. But the Duke espying the Kings side to be too strong, and that his men were put to the worse, withdrewe his troupes within their intrench∣ments, hauing lost the yong Lord of <HI>Chastres,</HI> and many other of great recko∣ning and account. The dukes horse was shot through with a bullet. The Count <HI>Horratio, Scipio,</HI> and <HI>Hanniball Bentiuolio,</HI> with many others were sore wounded and in daunger of their liues. The Duke not liking to trie the quarell any more by force, fell to his old politike practises,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The duke de Maine en∣treth Roan.</NOTE> and laboured by all possible meanes to get away away from the king without any further fighting. Wherfore leauing a garrison of some 500 Spaniards, French and Wallons in <HI>Caudebecke,</HI> and sending the Duke <HI>de Maine</HI> with 3000. Leaguers into <HI>Roan,</HI> hee reposing himselfe for a while within the Citie, at length marched away, as strongly and as closely as he could towarde <HI>Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The D. of Parma mar∣cheth toward Paris.</NOTE> there to refresh them after so long and tedious trauailes: as also to make tryall what store of Crownes might be gotten to satisfie his gree∣die Souldiers. The King pursued him, and following him in the taile, wat∣ched to skirmish with him vpon euerie aduauntage. But seeing hee coulde not effect that, which hee so earnestly affected, which was to drawe him to an entyre fight: hee caused all his troupes to turne heade, and ledde them before <HI>Caudebecke,</HI> which he foorthwith recouered from the Leaguers, and leauing a strong garrison to defende the Riuer, he retyred to <HI>Deepe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King goeth to Deepe.</NOTE> giuing leaue to the greatest part of his army to go refresh themselues in more fertile and commodi∣ous Countreys.</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Roan</HI> deliuered out of the hands of the King, by the comming of the duke to the great encouragement of the Leaguers, who seeing the Kinges fortune to frowne, began to triumph, and to reioyce exceedingly for this their vnexpected reliefe: and the rather for that this their good hap was seconded by diuerse other fortunate exploits in other places: for the Duke <HI>Ioyense</HI> ouerthrew certaine of the Kinges troupes before <HI>Lautrech,</HI> as they went to surprise the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d towne, being betrayd by some of those, who had promised them to bee a meanes to let them enter without anie empeachment. But they vsing this
<PB N="144" REF="76"/> as a stratagem to entrap the Kings souldiours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The leaguers ouerthrow sundry of the Kings forces.</NOTE> enformed the Duke of all theyr proceedings: who as soone as hee had intelligence thereof, gathered a strong power, and lying in ambush by the way as they s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould passe, suddenly set vpon them, and slue three or foure hundred, and tooke 200. prisoners: among whom were <HI>Monsieur de Violet, de Godius,</HI> &amp; sundry others of very good account. Three hundred fled to a castell not farre off, called <HI>la Trappe,</HI> which was forth∣with besieged by the said Duke, and the leaguers: they who were within the ca∣stell valiantly defended the place for a while, induring some thirtie or fortie Ca∣non shot at length considering their want of necessaries, &amp; how they were not able to maintaine themselues as they desired, they yeelded, hauing lost <HI>Colaun: bieres, Tanieuse, L'estolies, Raueleus, Bertrand, Deluan, Biense, de Lucques, La Brosse, Les∣pinac,</HI> and many other chieftains and commanders. <HI>La Barry, Portale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, Pibrac,</HI> besides, sundry gentlemen were taken prisoners, and well neare two hundred common souldiers. About the same time Duke <HI>Mercury</HI> likewise ouerthrew the power of the prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> &amp; the prince <HI>D' Ombes</HI> in <HI>Britany:</HI> and hauing taken ten field peeces frō them, slue many of their brauest and valiantest men, as <HI>Mem∣braise, Rochpot, Picheres,</HI> with some others, preuailing mightily in those quarters, and reducing sundry townes vnder the obedience of the seditious league. Thus did the Kings affaires begin to go backward, and many townes who were wa∣uering before, did nowe wholy abandon the King, and ioyne with the rebels. Sundry of the nobilitie, who were popishly affected, and therefore glad of the Kings bad successe, reuolted, and secretly conueyed themselues away, either to the enemy, or into their owne countries, and by their bad example, drew on in∣finite numbers to take the same course, forsaking their lawfull prince when hee stood in greatest need of their seruice, exposing that noble kingdome to the bar∣barous villanie of that viperous broode, who neuer cease gnawing out of the bowels of her, that should be their dearest and best beloued mother.</P>
<P>The King wanting sufficient power to stop these wicked proceedings, was forced to suffer the rebels to range at large, and to get many of his townes, both in <HI>Normandy, Britany, Prouince,</HI> and <HI>Dauphiny:</HI> They took likewise <HI>Espernon:</HI> wher∣in they found great store of wine, corne, &amp; other necessaries for the wars. These fortunate exploits so encouraged that rebellious route, and so puffed them vp with the pride of their owne forces, that they vtterly refused to bow their necks vnder the yoake of obedience: or to admit of any other gouernment then such as pleased thēselues. The king was loath to loose <HI>Espernon,</HI> being a towne of ve∣rie good importance, and therfore drew all his forces to the siege therof, where the Mareschall <HI>Biron</HI> was slaine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mareschall Biron slaine.</NOTE> with a shot from the wall, while hee was verie busie in viewing the army, &amp; in giuing order for the planting of the siege Yea, and the king himself was in great perill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The daunger of the King.</NOTE> hauing his horse killed vnder him with the same bullet, wherewith the Mareschall was slaine before. Duke <HI>Mercurie</HI> in the meane time tooke <HI>Manus</HI> in <HI>Britain,</HI> and the duke <HI>de Maine</HI> recouered <HI>Caude∣becke,</HI> and cleared all the riuer frō <HI>New-hauen</HI> vp to <HI>Roan.</HI> The D. of <HI>Nemours,</HI> go∣uernor of <HI>Lions,</HI> took <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Valence,</HI> and by that means cōmanded the riuer of <HI>Rhodanus.</HI> Now were the Germains who came into <HI>France</HI> in 91. desirous to returne home: so that taking their leaue of the French K. they marched toward <HI>Germany</HI> as fast as they could: but by reason they were not so many, nor so strong
<PB N="145" REF="76"/> as when they came first into <HI>France,</HI> they were desirous to passe rather by leaue then by force, and therefore they thought it conuenient to send to the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> for to obtaine License of him, that they might quietly passe through the Dukedom of <HI>Luxemburge,</HI> who readily condiscēded therto, vpon condition that they should not rifle the Countrey as they went, but should trauaile in peace∣able manner, and pay for whatsoeuer they tooke. Thus this great and mightie Army which had in conceite deuoured halfe <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ger∣maines re∣turne home.</NOTE> and at theyr comming had opened their way by fine force, returned home without dooing of anie great matter, and were driuen to aske leaue and to sue to their enimies for their pasport, such and so strange an alteration ensued in a short space.</P>
<P>The Leaguers beeing drunken with this prosperous successe, began to con∣sult about the election of a new King, and to that ende the Duke of <HI>Ferta,</HI> and the Cardinall of <HI>Sens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lea∣guers con∣sult about a new King.</NOTE> the Popes <HI>Nuntio</HI> were sent to <HI>Paris</HI> to bee present as assistants in this waightie businesse, as well to aide with their aduise and counsell, as to perswade with sundrie great states, who as yet were not fully resolued in this poynt, neyther whether they shoulde assent to so wicked and desperate proceedings.</P>
<P>Now albeit that the rebellious multitude had prospered for a long time, and were growen in a maner to the ful period of their desires, hauing effected ma∣ny things greatly tending to the countenancing of their affaires, in so much as that they had gayned the strongest &amp; richest cities, with infinit numbers of tur∣bulent and seditious heades to ioyne hand in hand with them, and to take parte in these their wicked and desperate attempts: yet, as it alwaies falleth out a∣mong such a confused and brainesicke rable, each mistrusted other, and being often admonished by the secret warnings of their owne consciences how dam∣nable a course they had runne, as also considering the intollerable seruitude wherto they were likely to bring themselues and their posteritie if they should longer submit themselues to their Spanish protector, and likewise seri∣ously pondering the kings estate, which was still supported by the cheefe Prin∣ces of the bloud, the ancient and most honourable Nobilitie of <HI>France,</HI> fauored by a number of valiant and wise personages, and countenanced by sundrie mightie Princes abroade, so that it still seemed to bee impossible to bring their purposes to passe, but rather that they should hazard their owne estates, their liues and liberties, yea, and in fine the whold kingdome, by calling in the Spa∣niards their olde and ancient enemies, who sought for nothing more then for the spoyle of the <HI>Flower de Lis.</HI> All these reasons with many other beeing well weighed, they supposed it to bee their best, to reconcile themselues to theyr king, of whole readie inclination to peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lea∣guers seeke for peace.</NOTE> though it were with hard conditi∣ons, they nothing doubted: wherupon they first priuily practised with sundry of the Papists which followed the king, whereof there were no small number, and hauing by their meanes made as it were an entrie vnto their pretensed pur∣pose, they sent their deputies to treate of a peace for three moneths, wherto the king assented in Iuly 1593. and afterwards continued the same for two monethes more, <HI>videlicet,</HI> vnto the ende of the moneth of December following: in all which time there was nothing doone, otherwise then the sending of sundrie messages each to other, with continual practising to draw the king to the liking
<PB N="146" REF="77"/> of Poperie: wherein there was such paines taken, and so farre humane polli∣cie preuailed, that this noble and famous Prince who had for the space of foure or fiue and twentie yeeres so valiantly and fortunately de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended the Gospell, and that with the hazard and perill of his owne life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. en∣clineth to Popery.</NOTE> freely exposing his royall person, his treasor, his friendes, and all other meanes whatsoeuer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the main∣tenance thereof, beganne to waxe calme in the defence of his profession, and to encline to that false and superstitious Religion of <HI>Rome,</HI> to the high displea∣sure of almightie God, the great dishonour of his princely Maiestie, and to the extreme greefe and astonishment of all the Protestants. Thus this noble and renowned Monarke, the hope (as it were) of al that fauored Gods truth, whom God had beautified with so many excellent graces and notable vertues, as cou∣rage, wisedom, zeale and constancy in so many apparant dangers, &amp; had made him the protecter and comforter of his afflicted church in <HI>France,</HI> had deliuered him out of the hands of all his enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.8</NOTE> and had giuen him his Lords house (as the Prophet speaketh) and if that had beene too little, would haue giuen him much more, making his proudest enemies to stoupe before h m, and to the admiration and wonderment of all men continually protected him in despight of all those who sought his ruine and ouerthrow, is another argument of the mutabilitie and interchangeable estate of all things in the world, and that not onely the heauens, the earth, the sea, the beasts of the field, the fishes in the wa∣ters, and the soules of the ayre are ful of varietie and change, but likewise king∣domes, countreyes, and commonwealths, Cities, and townes, all estates and conditions, of men high and low, rich and poore, wise and foolish, Prince and people, are full of change and alteration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundry prin¦cipall Cities of France returne to the King.</NOTE>In Ianuarie and Februarie immediatly folowing the Kings so apparant incli∣nation to Poperie, most of the principall Cities of <HI>France</HI> which had with so notorious obstinacy for a long while shaken off the yoake of their obedience, beganne to bee reclaimed, and as it were on the sodaine to bee arranged on the kings side, &amp; <HI>Meaux, Lyons, Orleance, Bourges, Ponto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se,</HI> with many other townes of speciall monument &amp; account opened their gates and willingly receiued the kings garrisons, crying <HI>Vine Henry</HI> 4. <HI>roy de France &amp; de Nauarre,</HI> expelling the Spaniards and hispaniolised French, shewing great forwardnesse to withstande the outragious proceedings of the furious and desperate Leaguers.</P>
<P>The king had no sooner reduced these strong Townes vnder his obedience, hauing by this meanes mightily strengthned himselfe and weakened his ene∣mies, but that hee was forthwith aduised by the Princes of his bloud, the dukes and peeres of <HI>France,</HI> the officers of his Crowne, the Lords of his Councel, and the most no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able personages of his courts of Parliamēts, to frame himself to his corona ion and annoynting, and that in such maner as all other kings his prede∣cessors had done before him.
