<HEAD>THE GENERALL OF GREAT BRITAINE.
CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE State of euery Kingdome well managed by prudent gouernment, seemes to me
to represent a Humane Body, guided by the soueraigntie of the <HI>Reasonable Soule:</HI>
the Country and Land it selfe representing the one, the Actions and State-affaires
the other. Sith therefore the excellencies of the whole are but vnperfectly laid o∣pen,
where either of these Parts is defectiue, our intendment is to take a view as well
of the outward Body and Lineaments of the now-flourishing British Monarchy
(the Ilands) Kingdomes and Prouinces thereof in actuall possession, (for with others, no lesse
iustly claimed in the Continent, we meddle not) which shall be the content of our first or <HI>Choro∣graphicall
Tome,</HI> containing the foure first Bookes of this our <HI>Theater:</HI> as also of its successiue go∣uernment
and vitall actions of State, which shall be our second or <HI>Historicall Tome,</HI> containing the
fiue last Bookes. And here first we will (by example of the best Anatomists) propose to the view
the <HI>whole Body</HI> and <HI>Monarchy</HI> intire (as farre as conueniently we could comprise it) and after will
dissect and lay open the particular Members, Veynes, and Ioynts, (I meane the Shires, Riuers,
Cities, and Townes) with such things as shall occurre most worthy our regard, and most behoue∣full
for our vse.</P>
<P>(2) The Iland of <HI>Great Britaine</HI> (which with her adioyning Isles is here first presented) contai∣neth
the Kingdomes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is of many accounted the greatest Island in the
<HI>World,</HI> though <HI>Iustus Lypsius</HI> giues that prayse to <HI>Cuba</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> as the Orientall Nauigatores doe
vnto <HI>Sumatra</HI> (taken for <HI>Ptolomees Taprobana)</HI> or to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> the Island of S. <HI>Laurence,</HI> both which
are neere vnto, or vnder the Equinoctiall line; In which we will not contend; as pleasing our selues

with her other prayses greater then her <HI>Greatnes;</HI> yet with this honour also, that it was (without que∣stion)
the greatest Island of the <HI>Romane World,</HI> and for any thing yet certainly knowne, of all the rest.
Concerning whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ositure in respect of <HI>Heauen, Lueretius</HI> (the first of the Latine Writers that names
<HI>Britaine)</HI> seemeth to place it in the same Parallel with <HI>Pontus,</HI> where he saith:
<Q><L>Nam quid Britannum coelum differre putamus, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<Q><L>What differs Britaines heauen from that of Nile?</L>
<L>Or Pontus welkin, from Gadz warmer Isle?</L></Q>
In which, by a certaine crosse comparison, he opposeth two likes against two vnlikes, <HI>Britaine</HI> and
<HI>Pontus</HI> against <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Gads.</HI> But to seeke into profound Antiquitie, rather then present practise,
for matters, in which <HI>Vse makes perfectnesse,</HI> were to affect the giuing light by shadowes, rather then by
Sunne-shine.</P>
<P>(3) It is by experience found to lie included from the degree fiftie, and thirtie scruples of La∣titude,
and for Longitude extended from the 13. degree, and 20. minutes, vnto the 22. and 50. mi∣nutes,
according to the obseruation of <HI>Mercator.</HI> It hath <HI>Britaine, Normandy,</HI> and other parts of
<HI>France</HI> vpon the South, the <HI>Lower Germany, Denmarke,</HI> and <HI>Norway</HI> vpon the East; the Isles of <HI>Ork∣ney</HI>
and the <HI>Deucaledonian Sea,</HI> vpon the North; the <HI>Hebrides</HI> vpon the West, and from it all other I∣lands
and Ilets, which doe scatteredly inuiron it, and shelter themselues (as it were) vnder the sha∣dow
of <HI>Great Albion</HI> (another name of this famous Iland) are also accounted Britannish, and are
therefore here described altogether.</P>
<P>(4) <HI>Britaine</HI> thus seated in the Ocean hath her prayses, not onely in the present sense, and vse of
her commodities, but also in those honorable Eulogies, which the learnedst of <HI>Antiquaries</HI> hath col∣lected
out of the noblest Authors, that he scarce seemeth to haue left any gleanings: neither will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
transplant them out of his flourishing Gardens, but as necessitie compels, sith nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
or other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> said.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
(5) That <HI>Britaine</HI> therefore is the Seas <HI>High Admirall,</HI> is famously knowne: and the <HI>Fortunate
Island</HI> supposed by some, as <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Anesbury</HI> doth shew: whose ayre is more temperate (saith <HI>Cae∣sar)</HI>
then <HI>France;</HI> whose Soile bringeth forth all graine in abundance, saith <HI>Tacitus;</HI> whose Seas pro∣duce
orient Pearle, saith <HI>Suetonius;</HI> whose Fields are the seat of a Summer Queene, saith <HI>Orpheus;</HI>
her wildest parts free from wilde beasts, saith the ancient <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gyricke,</HI> and her chiefe Citie worthily
named <HI>Augusta,</HI> as saith <HI>Ammianus:</HI> So as we may truely say with the royall <HI>Psalmist, Our lines are
fallen in pleasant places, yea we haue a faire inheritance.</HI> Which whatsoeuer by the goodnesse of God,
and industry of man it is now, yet our English <HI>Poet</HI> hath truely described vnto vs the first face there∣of,
thus;
<Q><L>The Land which warre-like Britaines now possesse</L>
<L>And therein haue their mightie Empire raisde,</L>
<L>In ancient times was saluage Wildernesse,</L>
<L>Vnpeopled, vnmanur'd, vnprou'd, vnpraisde.</L></Q></P>
<P>(6) And albeit the Ocean doth at this present thrust it selfe betweene <HI>Doue,</HI> and <HI>Callis,</HI> diuiding
them with a deepe and vast entrenchment; so that <HI>Britaine</HI> thereby is of a supposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made an
Iland: yet diuers haue stifly held, that once it was ioyned by an arme of land to the Continent of
<HI>Gallia.</HI> To which opinion <HI>Spencer</HI> farther alluding, thus closeth his Stanza.</P>
<Q><L>Ne was it Iland then, ne was it paisde</L>
<L>Amid the Ocean waues, ne was it sought</L>
<L>Of Merchants farre, for profits thererem praisde,</L>
<L>But was all desolate, and of some thought</L>
<L>By Sea to haue beene from the Celticke Mainland brought.</L></Q>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as a matter meerly coniecturall (because it is not plaine that there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Ilands nor hils
<PB REF="6"/>
before <HI>Noahs</HI> floud) I leaue at large: <HI>Virgill</HI> surely (of all <HI>Poets</HI> the most learned) when describing
the Shield which <HI>Vulcan</HI> forged (in <HI>Virgils</HI> braine) for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> he cals the <HI>Morini</HI> (people about <HI>Cal∣lis)
the outmost men,</HI> doth onely meane that they were Westward, the furthest Inhabitants vpon the
Continent, signifying withall that <HI>Britaine</HI> as being an Iland, lay out of the world: but yet not out
of the knowledge of men, for the Commodities thereof inuited the famous Greeke Colonies of
Merchants, which dwelt at <HI>Massilia</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> to venture hither, as hath beene well obserued out of
<HI>Strabo.</HI></P>
<P>(7) And as <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> was the first Romane which euer gaue an attempt to conquer it, so will
we close its prayses with a late Epigram, concerning the outward face of the Isle, and the motiue
of <HI>Caesars</HI> comming.</P>

<P><PB REF="7"/>
(8) The diuision of <HI>Britaine</HI> concerning the gouernment and Territories thereof; at such time
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ceaser</HI> here arriued, doth not sufficiently appeare. <HI>Caesar</HI> himselfe makes so sparing mention there∣in,
that we haue little cause to beleeue <HI>Florus,</HI> where he makes <HI>Lauie</HI> say, that after <HI>Caesar</HI> had slaine
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> multitude of <HI>Britaines, he subdued the residue of the Ile,</HI> but rather with exquisite <HI>Hora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> that
he did not at all touch them, as the word <HI>intactus</HI> doth in him purport.</P>
<P>(9) Kings they were, and therefore that diuision which was here in <HI>Caesars</HI> time, was into <HI>King∣domes;</HI>
the old names of whole Nations, as also the knowledge of their seuerall abodes, hidden vn∣der
the rabbish of so many ages, haue of late with infinite labours and exquisite iudgement, beene
probably restored and abounded; yet that no mans expectation and desire be too much frustrated,
reason wils that we briefly set forth such diuisions of the Land, as many repute not ancient onely,
but authenticke.</P>
<P>(10) Our seeming ancient Historians begin it at <HI>Brute,</HI> who to euery of his three sonnes gaue a
part, called presently after their names; as <HI>Loegria</HI> to <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rme</HI> his eldest sonne: <HI>Cambria</HI> to <HI>Camber</HI>
his second sonne; and <HI>Albama</HI> to <HI>Albanist</HI> his third sonne: And doubtlesse, if there had beene more
Nations of fame in this Iland, <HI>Brute</HI> should haue had more sonnes fathered on him: which conceit
some ascribe to <HI>Monmouth,</HI> holding that before him it was neuer so diuided.</P>
<P>(11) <HI>Ptolemie</HI> naming <HI>Britaine</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> and the <HI>Lesse,</HI> hath beene by some mistaken, as so diui∣ding
this Iland into two parts; but his proportion and distance from the <HI>Aequator,</HI> compared with
his Geographicall description will euince, that he calleth this our Iland <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> and <HI>Ireland
Britaine the Lesse.</HI></P>
<P>(12) Howbeit some later doe make indeed the South and more Champion to be called <HI>Great
Britaine,</HI> and the North more Mountainous, <HI>Britaine the Lesse;</HI> whose Inhabitants anciently were
distinguished into the <HI>Maiatae,</HI> and <HI>Caledonij,</HI> and now by the <HI>Scots</HI> are into <HI>Heghlandmen</HI> and <HI>Law∣landmen.</HI>
<PB REF="7"/>
But that <HI>Northerne</HI> clime being more piercing for the <HI>Romans</HI> constitutions, and <HI>lesse profi∣table
or fruitfull,</HI> they set their bounds not farre from <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> and altogether neglected the o∣ther
parts more Northward.</P>
<P>(13) This neerer part of <HI>Britaine</HI> they then diuided into two parts; for the more Southerne tract,
together with <HI>Wales, Dio</HI> termeth the <HI>Higher,</HI> and that more Northward the <HI>Lower,</HI> as by the seate
of their Legions doth appeare; for the second <HI>Legion Augusta</HI> (which kept at <HI>Caerleon</HI> in <HI>South-Wales)</HI>
and the twentieth called <HI>Victrix</HI> (which remained at <HI>Chester)</HI> he placeth in the <HI>Higher Britaine:</HI> but the
sixt <HI>Legion</HI> surnamed also <HI>Victrix,</HI> resident at <HI>Yorke,</HI> serued (as he writeth) in the <HI>Lower Britain;</HI> which
diuision, as seemeth, was made by <HI>Seuerus</HI> the Emperour, who hauing vanquished <HI>Albinus,</HI> Generall
of the <HI>Britaines,</HI> and reduced their State vnder his obedience, diuided the gouernment thereof into
two Prouinces, and placed two Prefects ouer the same.</P>
<P>(14) After this againe the <HI>Romanes</HI> did apportion <HI>Britaine</HI> into three parts, whose limits our <HI>great
Antiquary</HI> assigneth by the ancient <HI>Archiepiscopall</HI> Seates, grounding his coniecture on the saying of
Pope <HI>Lucius,</HI> who affirmes that the Ecclesiasticall Iurisdictions of the Christians, accorded with the
precincts of the Romane Magistrates, &amp; that their Archbishops had their Sees in those Cities where∣in
their Presidents abode: so that the ancient Seates of the three Archbishops here, being <HI>London</HI> in
the East, <HI>Caerleon</HI> in the West, and <HI>Yorke</HI> in the North; <HI>Londons</HI> Diocesse (as seemeth) made <HI>Britaine
prima; Caerleon, Britaine secunda;</HI> and <HI>Yorke, Maxima Caesariensis.</HI></P>
<P>(15) But in the next age, when the power of their Presidents began to grow ouer-great, they a∣gaine
diuided <HI>Britaine</HI> into fiue parts, adding the three former <HI>Valentia</HI> and <HI>Flauia Caesarie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis:</HI> the
first of which two seemeth to haue beene the Northerly part of <HI>Maxima Casarie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis,</HI> recouered from
the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> by <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Generall, vnder <HI>Valence</HI> the Emperour, and in honour of him,
named <HI>Valentia:</HI> and <HI>Flauia</HI> may be coniectured to receiue the name from <HI>Flauius</HI> the Emperour
(sonne of <HI>Theodosius)</HI> for that we reade not of the name <HI>Britaine Flauia,</HI> before his time.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
(16) So these fiue partitions had their limits assigned after this manner: <HI>Britaine prima</HI> contained
those coasts that lay betwixt <HI>Thamesis,</HI> the <HI>Seuerne,</HI> and the <HI>British Sea: Britaine secunda</HI> extended from
<HI>Seuerne</HI> vnto the <HI>Irish</HI> Seas, containing the Country that we now call <HI>Wales: Flauia Caesariensis,</HI> was
that which lay betwixt the Riuers <HI>Humber</HI> and <HI>Tyne:</HI> and <HI>Valentia</HI> from the said Riuer, and <HI>Picts wall</HI>
reached vnto the Rampire neere <HI>Edenburgh</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the farthest part that the <HI>Romanes</HI> possessed
when this diuision was in vse. For the seuerall people inhabiting all those parts, with their ancient
Names &amp; Borders (whether designed by the <HI>Romans,</HI> or the old <HI>Britaines)</HI> together with our moderne
<HI>Names</HI> and <HI>Shires,</HI> answerable to each of them: we will referre you to the Tables thereof elsewhere.</P>
<P>(17) This whole Prouince of <HI>Britaine,</HI> as in our History shall appeare, was highly esteemed of the
Emperours themselues, assuming as a glorious surname <HI>Britanicus:</HI> comming thither in person o∣uer
those dangerous and scarce knowne Seas; here marrying, liuing, and dying; enacting here Lawes
for the whole Empire, &amp; giuing to those Captaines that serued here, many Ensignes of great honor;
yea <HI>Claudius</HI> gaue <HI>Plantius</HI> (the first Prefect of that Prouince) the right hand, as he accompanyed
him in his Triumph: and his owne Triumph of <HI>Britaine</HI> was set out with such magnificence, that the
Prouinces brought in golden Crownes of great waight, the Gouernours commanded to attend, and
the very Capt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines permitted to be present at the same: A Nauall Coronet was fixed vpon apinna∣cle
of his Pallace, Arches and Trophees were raysed in <HI>Rome,</HI> and himselfe on his aged knees moun∣ted
the staires into the Capitoll, supported by his two sonnes in Law: so great a ioy conceiued he in
himselfe for the Conquest of some small portion of <HI>Britaine.</HI></P>
<P>(18) How the <HI>Romans</HI> found it, held it, and left it, as times ripened and rottened their successe, with
the Names, the Inhabitants, Manners &amp; Resisters, I leaue to be pursued in the following Histories:
and will onely now shew thee these three Kingdomes, that are (in present) the chiefe Bodies of
<HI>Great Britaines Monarchie;</HI> two of which <HI>(Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland)</HI> shall in their due places haue their
farther and more particular Descriptions.

<P>THE <HI>Saxons</HI> glory now neere to expire, by his appointment who holdeth both times and
Kingdomes in his all ordering hand; their owne Swords being the Instruments, and the
<HI>Danes</HI> the maules that beat their beautifull Diadem into pieces; the <HI>Normans,</HI> a stirring Na∣tion,
(neyther expected, nor much feared) vnder the leading of <HI>William</HI> their Duke, and en∣couragement
of the <HI>Romane</HI> Bishop (an vsuall promoter here of broken titles) made hither
sodainly into <HI>England,</HI> who in one onely battell, with the title of his sword and slaughter or <HI>Herold,</HI> set
the Emperiall Crowne thereof vpon his owne head: which no sooner was done, but the <HI>English</HI> went
downe, and the <HI>Normans</HI> lording it, became <HI>Owners of those Cities which themselues neuer built; possessed
those Vineyards which they neuer planted; dranke of those Wells which they neuer had digged; and inhabitted
those houses, filled with riches, for which they neuer had laboured:</HI> for they found it to be as <HI>the land
whereupon the Lord set his eye, euen from the beginning to the end of the yeare:</HI> not onely <HI>drinking water
of the raine of heauen,</HI> but hauing also <HI>riuers of waters and fountaines in her valleyes, and without all scar∣sitie,
whose stones are yron, and out of whose mountaines is digged brasse.</HI> This made them more resolute
at first to settle themselues in this fairest and fruitfullest part of the Iland; the Conquerour vsing all
policie both Martiall and Ciuill, to plant his posteritie here for euer. How he found the Land go∣uerned
we shewed in the <HI>Heptarchy;</HI> but his restlesse thoughts were not contented with conquering
the Nation and their Land, vnlesse he also ouercame their very <HI>Customes, Lawes,</HI> and <HI>Language.</HI></P>
<P>(2) Touching the distribution of the Kingdome, whereas other Kings before him made vse of
it, chiefly for the good of the people, and better ministring of Iustice, he made vse of it, to know the
wealth of his Subiects, and to enrich his Coffers: for <HI>he caused a description to be made of all England,</HI>
<PB REF="9"/>
how much land euery one of his Barons possessed, how many Knights fees, how many Plow. lands, how ma∣ny
in villenage, how many head of beasts, yea how much money euery man from the greatest, to the
least did possesse, and what rents might be made of entry mans <HI>possession,</HI> the Booke of which inquisition
(yet in the Exchequer) was called <HI>Domesday,</HI> for the generalitie of that Iudgement on all the Land:
Whereunto we may adde his other distribution of this Land (worse then any former) when <HI>thrusting
the English out of their possessions, he distributed their inheritances to his Souldiers; yet so, that all should be
held of the King, as of the onely true Lord and possessor.</HI></P>
<P>(3) For the Lawes by which he meant to gouerne, he held one excellent rule and purpose, which
was, that <HI>a People ought to be ruled by Lawes written and certaine:</HI> for otherwise new Iudges would
still bring new Iudgements: and therefore he caused <HI>twelue to be chosen out of euery Countie, which
should on their oath, without inclining one way or other, neither adding nor detracting, open vnto him all
their ancient Lawes and Customes.</HI> By whose relation vnderstanding that three sorts of Lawes former∣ly
were in the Land, <HI>Merchenlage, West Saxonlage, Danelage;</HI> he had preferred these last, (himselfe
and people being anciently deriued from those Northerne people) had not all the Barons beway∣ling
to the King, <HI>how grieuous it was for a Land to be iudged by those Lawes which they vnderstood not,
altered his resolute purpose:</HI> yet in bringing in the strange formes of <HI>Norman</HI> Processe, and pleading in
the <HI>French</HI> tongue (which continued till <HI>Edward</HI> the thirds time,) that grieuance was but slenderly
preuented. So likewise did he much alter the old Courts of Iustice, where these Lawes should be
ministred: but whereas the ancient Kings of <HI>England,</HI> according to <HI>Moses</HI> his example, sate in person
in the seate of Iustice, to right the greater affayres of their Subiects, as <HI>William La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bert</HI> sheweth in
King <HI>Alfred, Edgar, Canutus, &amp;c.</HI> and proues out of the Kings Oath, out of <HI>Bracton, Britaine, Saxon
Lawes, &amp;c.</HI> King <HI>William</HI> not onely continued this; but besides erected some other Courts of Iu∣stice,
as the Exchequer, and certaine Courts and Sessions to be held foure times euery yeare: ap∣pointing
<PB REF="10"/>
both Iudges (some to heare causes, others to whom appeales should be made, but none
from them) and also <HI>Prefects to looke to good orders.</HI> Those last <HI>Polydor</HI> calleth <HI>Iustices of Peace;</HI> but
their institution seemes to be farre later: and no lesse is his errour on the other side, in saying the
Conquerour first instituted Sheriffes, and the tryall by twelue men, which were both ancienter.</P>
<P>(4) And because the Conquerour, for honour of Bishops, caused them to remoue from small

<P>(5) To speake nothing of these twentie-eight Flamins the Priests of Idolatry, and the three
Arch-Flamins, whose seates were at <HI>London, Caerlion,</HI> and <HI>Yorke;</HI> all of them conuerted by King <HI>Lu∣cius</HI>
into Christian Bishops Sees: let vs onely insist vpon the three last, by the same King appointed
to be Metropolitanes ouer the rest; among whom <HI>London</HI> is said to be chiefe: whose first Christian
Arch-bishop was <HI>Thean,</HI> the builder of S. <HI>Peters</HI> Church in <HI>Cornehill</HI> for his <HI>Cathedrall,</HI> as by an ancient
Table there lately hanging, was affirmed, and tradition to this day doth hold. Our <HI>British</HI> Histori∣ans
doe bring a succession of fifteene Arch-bishops, to haue sate from his time vnto the comming of
the <HI>Saxons,</HI> whose last was <HI>Vodius,</HI> slaine by King <HI>Vortiger,</HI> for reprehending his heathenish marriage
with <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> the Daugher of <HI>Hengist.</HI> At what time began the misery of the Land, and of holy Reli∣gion,
<PB REF="16"/>
both which they layd wast vnder their prophane feete: vntill <HI>Ethelbert</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> the first Chri∣stian
<HI>Saxon</HI> King, aduanced Christainitie, &amp; <HI>Augustine</HI> to the Arch-bishopricke of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> when
<HI>London</HI> vnder <HI>Melitus</HI> became subiect to that See.</P>
<P>(6) At <HI>Caerlion</HI> vpon <HI>Vske,</HI> in the time of great <HI>Arthur,</HI> sate <HI>Dubritius,</HI> a man excellently learned,
and of an holy conuersation: he had sate Bishop of <HI>Landaffe</HI> a long time, and with <HI>Germanus</HI> and <HI>Lu∣pus,</HI>
two <HI>French</HI> Bishops greatly impugned the Pelagian Heresie, infecting at that time the Iland ve∣ry
farre, whose fame and integritie was such, that he was made Arch-bishop of all <HI>Wales:</HI> but growne
very old, he resigned the same vnto <HI>Dauia</HI> his Disciple, a man of greater birth, but greater austeritie
of life, who by consent of King, <HI>Arthur,</HI> remoued his Arch-bishops See vnto <HI>Meneuia,</HI> a place very
solitary and meete for meditation: the miracles of the man, (which are said to be many) changed
both the name of the place into his owne, and robbed <HI>Caerlion</HI> of her Archiepiscopall seate: This
See of S <HI>Dauids,</HI> (as in an ancient Register belonging to that Church is recorded) had seauen Bi∣shops
Suffraganes subiect vnto it which were <HI>Exceter, Bathe. He eford, Landaffe, Bangor, S. Asaph,</HI>
and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes</HI> in <HI>Ireland:</HI> notwithstanding, eyther for want of Pall, carried into <HI>Britanny</HI> by Arch-bi∣shop
<HI>Sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son,</HI> in a dangerous infection of sicknesse, either by pouertie or negligence, it lost that Iu∣risdiction,
and in the dayes of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, became subiect to the See of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>(7) <HI>Yorke</HI> hath had better successe then eyther of the former, in retayning her originall honour,
though much impaired in her circuit, challenging to haue beene some time Metropolitane ouer all
the Bishops in <HI>Scotland:</HI> and although it was made equall in honour and power with <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by
Pope <HI>Gregory,</HI> as <HI>Beda</HI> relateth; and had twelue Suffragan Bishoprickes that owed obedience, onely
foure now acknowledge <HI>Yorke</HI> their Metropolitane, but <HI>Canterbury</HI> the Superiour: for <HI>William</HI> the
Conquerour thinking it dangerous to haue two in like authoritie, least the one should set on his
Crowne, and the other strike it off, left <HI>Yorke</HI> to be a Primate, but <HI>Canterbury</HI> onely the Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of
all <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="16"/>
(8) The <HI>Lichfield</HI> was made an Archiepiscopall See by Pope <HI>Hadrian</HI> the first, at the suit of <HI>Offa,</HI>
the great King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> is manifested by <HI>Mathew</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> vnto whose Iurisdiction were as∣signed
the Bishoprickes of <HI>Winchester, Hereford, Leicester, Sidnacester, Helm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am,</HI> and <HI>Dunwich,</HI> and
whose first and last bishop was <HI>Aldwin.</HI> That <HI>Winchester</HI> also had intended an Archiepiscopall
Pall, the same Author recordeth, when <HI>Henry Bloys,</HI> of the bloud royall, greatly contended with the
Arch bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> for superioritie, vnder the pretence of being Cardinall <HI>de latere;</HI> to him
an Archiepiscopall Pall was sent, with power and authoritie ouer seauen Churches, but he dying be∣fore
that the designe was done, the See of <HI>Winchester</HI> remained in subiection to <HI>Canterbury.</HI> And that
(long before) the See of <HI>Dorchester</HI> by <HI>Oxford,</HI> had the Iurisdiction of an Arch-bishop, is apparant
by those Prouinces that were vnder his Diocesse, which were <HI>Winchester, Oxford, Lincolne, Salisbury,
B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estow, Wells, Lichfield, Chester,</HI> and <HI>Excester;</HI> and the first Bishop of this great circuit, <HI>Berinu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> was
called the Apostle and Bishop of the West-<HI>Saxons:</HI> which in his next successor was diuided into two
parts, <HI>Winchester</HI> and <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and not long after into <HI>Lichfield, Sidnacester,</HI> and <HI>Legecester;</HI> and
lastly, the See remoued from <HI>Dorchester</HI> to <HI>Lincolne,</HI> as now it is And thus farre for the diuision of
this Realme, both Politicke and Ecclesiasticke, as it hath stood and stands at this day.</P>
<P>(9) But the whole Ilands diuision, by most certaine Record was anciently made, when <HI>Iulius
Agric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la</HI> drew a trench or fortification vpon that narrow space of ground betwixt <HI>Edenbrough Frith,</HI>
and <HI>Dunbretton Bay,</HI> making the Southerne part a Prouince vnto the Romane Empire. Afterwards
<HI>Hadrian</HI> the Emperour seeing perhaps the Prouince too spacious to be well gouerned without great
expense, drew backe these limits almost fourescore miles shotter, euen to the mouth of the Riuer
<HI>Tyne,</HI> whence he fortified with a wall of admirable worke vnto <HI>Carlile,</HI> which stood the Lands bor∣der,
while it stood as a <HI>Romane</HI> Prouince: yet the conquering <HI>Saxons</HI> did spread againe ouer those
bounds, and (as seemeth) enlarged their gouernment to that first Tract, as by this inscription in
a Stone Crosse, standing vpon a Bridge ouer the water of <HI>Frith,</HI> appeareth.</P>
<Q><PB REF="17"/>
<L>I am a free March as Passengers may ken,</L>
<L>To Scots, to Britaines, and to Englishmen.</L></Q>
<P>(10) But afterward <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and <HI>Malcolme</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> falling to an a∣greement
for their limits, arreared a Crosse vpon Stanemore, where on the one side the portraiture
and Armes of the King of <HI>England</HI> was sculptured, and of the King of <HI>Scots</HI> on the other (a piece
whereof is yet remaining there neere to the Spittle) thence called the Rev-Crosse, there erected
to be a Meare-stone to either Kingdome. His successors also abolished the two partitions in the
West, whereby the <HI>Welsh</HI> became one Nation and Kingdome with the <HI>English</HI> It is also said that
King <HI>Stephen</HI> to purchase friendship with the <HI>Scottish Nation,</HI> gaue vnto their King the Countie of
<HI>Cumberland</HI> who with it held both <HI>Westmorland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland;</HI> but as <HI>Newbrigensis</HI> writeth,
he restored them to King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, wisely considering his great power and right to those
parts.</P>
<P>(11) The last knowne borders were from the <HI>Sulway</HI> in the West bay, along the Cheuiot hills,
vnto the water of <HI>Tweed</HI> by <HI>Barwicke</HI> in the East, no maintaine which, on each part many Lawes
haue beene made, and many inrodes, robberies, and fewdes practised; all which by the hand of God
is now cut off, and by the rightfull succession of King IAMES our Soueraigne, who hath bro∣ken
downe the partition of this great Island, and made the extreames of two Kingdomes, the very
midst of his great vnited Empire.

CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>KENT, the first Prouince appearing in the South of this Kingdome, is bounded vpon the
North with the famous Riuer <HI>Thamisis:</HI> on the East with the <HI>Germane Ocean:</HI> on the South
with <HI>Sussex</HI> and the narrow Seas: and vpon the West and <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Surrey.</HI> The length
thereof extended from <HI>Langley</HI> in the West, vnto <HI>Ramsgate</HI> Eastward in the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> is
about 53. English miles. From <HI>Rother</HI> in the South, vnto the Isle of <HI>Graine</HI> Northward, the
bredth is not much aboue 26. and the whole circumference about 160. miles.</P>
<P>(2) Informe it somewhat resembleth the head of a hammer or Battle-axe, and lyeth corner-wise
into the Sea: by <HI>Strabo, Caesar, Diadorus,</HI> and <HI>Ptolemie,</HI> called <HI>Cantium,</HI> of <HI>Cant</HI> or <HI>Angle</HI> or
<HI>Corner:</HI> either of <HI>Caine</HI> a <HI>British</HI> word, which signifieth <HI>Bushes</HI> or <HI>Woods,</HI> whereof that Countie in those
former times was plentifully stored.</P>
<P>(3) The ayre, though not very cleere, because of the vapours arising from the Sea, and Riuer:
that enuiron the same, is both wholesome and temperate, as seated neerest to the <HI>Equino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticall,</HI> and the
furthest from the <HI>North Pole,</HI> not touched with cold as the other parts of the Land are.</P>
<P>(4) The soile towards the East is vneuen, rising into little hils, the West more leuell and woody,
in all places fruitfull, and in plentie equals any other of the Realme, yea, and in some things hath
the best esteeme: as in Broad-clothes, Fruits, and feedings for Cattell. Onely Mines (except Iron)
are wanting: all things else deliuered with a prodigall heart and liberall hand</P>

the death of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and surrender of King <HI>Iohn</HI> therein hapning.</P>
<P>(6) A conceit is, that <HI>Goodwin Sands</HI> were sunke for the sinnes of himselfe and his sonnes.
Shelues indeed that dangerously lye on the North east of this Countie, and are much feared of all
<HI>Nauigators.</HI> These formerly had beene firme ground, but by a sodaine inundation of the Sea were
swallowed vp, as at the same time a great part of <HI>Flanders</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries</HI> were: and the like
also at the same time befell in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as <HI>Hector Boetius</HI> their <HI>Historiographer</HI> writeth A like accident
hapned in the yeare 1586 the fourth day of <HI>August,</HI> in this Countie, at <HI>Mottingham,</HI> a Towne eight
miles from <HI>London,</HI> sodainly the ground began to sinke, and three great Elmes thereon growing,
were carryed so deepe into the bowels of the earth, that no part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could any more be seene,
the hole left in compasse fourescore yards about, and a line of fiftie fadomes plummed into it doth

<P>(7) The Kentish people in <HI>Caesars</HI> time were accounted the ciuillest among the <HI>Britaines:</HI> and
as yet esteeme themselues the freest Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cts of the <HI>English,</HI> not conquered, but compounded with
by the <HI>Normans:</HI> and herein glory, that their King and Commons of all the <HI>Saxons</HI> were the first
Christians, conuerted in <HI>Anno</HI> 596. yea, and long before that time also <HI>Kent</HI> receiued the faith: for it
is recorded that <HI>Lucius</HI> the first Christian <HI>British</HI> King in this Iland, built a Church to the name and
seruice of Christ, within the Castle of <HI>Douer,</HI> endowing it with the Tolle of the same Hauen.</P>
<P>(8) This Countie is enriched with two Cities and Bishops Sees, strengthened with 27. Ca∣stles,
graced with 8. of his Majesties most Princely Houses, traded with 24. Market-Townes, and
<PB REF="19"/>
beautified with many stately and gorgeous buildings The chiefest Citie thereof, the Metropolitan
and Arch bishops See, is <HI>Canterbury,</HI> built (as our <HI>British Historians</HI> report) 900. yeares before the
birth of Christ; by <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntington,</HI> called <HI>Caier Kent,</HI> wherein (as M. <HI>Lambard</HI> saith) was e∣rected
the first Schoole of professed Arts and Sciences, and the same a patterne vnto <HI>Sigibert</HI> King
of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> for his foundation at <HI>Cambridge:</HI> notwithstanding by the computation of time,
this <HI>Sigibert</HI> was slaine by <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> thirtie yeares before that <HI>Theodore</HI> the <HI>Grecian</HI> was
Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who is said to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ector of that Academie. But certaine it is, that <HI>Aust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
the Monke had made this Citie famous before that time, by the conuersion of these <HI>Saxons</HI> vnto
Christianitie, and in building a most magnificent Church to Gods seruice, wherein eight of their
Kings haue beene interred, but all their Monuments since ouer shadowed by the height of <HI>Beckets</HI>
Tombe, that for glory, wealth, and superstitious worships, equalized the <HI>Pyramides</HI> of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gypt,</HI> or

<P>(6) The place of most account in this Shire is <HI>Chichester,</HI> by the <HI>Britaines</HI> called <HI>Caercei,</HI> a Citie
beautifull and large, and very well walled about, first built by <HI>Cissa</HI> the second King of the <HI>South-Saxons,</HI>
wherein his Royall palace was kept. And when King <HI>William</HI> the First had enacted that
<HI>Bishops Seas</HI> should be translated out of small Townes vnto places of greater resort, the Residence
of the Bishop (vntill then held at <HI>Selsey)</HI> was remoued to this Citie, where Bishop <HI>Raulfe</HI> began a
most goodly Cathedrall Church: but before it was fully finished, by a sudden mischance of fire
was quite consumed. Yet the same Bishop, with the helping liberalitie of King <HI>Henry</HI> the First, be∣gan
it againe, and saw it wholly finished; whose beautie and greatnesse her fatall enemy still en∣uying,
againe cast downe in the dayes of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, and by her raging flames consu∣med
the buildings both of it and the Bishops Palace adioyning, which <HI>Seffrid</HI> the second Bishop
of that name reedified and built a new. And now to augment the honour of this place, the Citie
hath borne the Title of an <HI>Earledome;</HI> whereof they of <HI>Arundell</HI> were sometimes so stiled. Whose
Gradustion for Latitude, is remoued from the Equator vnto the degree fiftie, fiftie fiue minutes;
and for Longitude, obseruing the same point in the West, whence <HI>Mercator</HI> hath measured, are
twentie degrees.</P>

where King <HI>Athelstan</HI> appointed the mintage of his Moneyes, and <HI>William de Warron</HI> built a strong
Castle, whereunto the disloyall <HI>Barons</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third in warlike manner resorted, and
fought a great Battle against their owne Soueraigne and his sonne, wherein the King had his Horse
slaine vnder him, <HI>Richard,</HI> King of the <HI>Romans</HI> surprised and taken in a Wind-mill, and Prince <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
deliuered vnto them vpon vnequall conditions of peace. But a greater Battle was fought at

his <HI>Conquerour</HI> by losing of his life, among sixtie seuen thousand nine hundred seuentie-foure Eng∣lish

<P>(8) But places of other note in this Shire are these: from <HI>Basham,</HI> Earle <HI>Harold</HI> taking the Sea
for his delight, in a small Boat, was driuen vpon the Coast of <HI>Normandie,</HI> where by Duke <HI>William</HI> he
was retained, till he had sworne to make him King after <HI>Edward Confessors</HI> death; which oath being

<P>(9) The commodities of this Prouince are many and diuers, both in <HI>Corne, Cattle, Woods, Iron,</HI>

is one hundred and twelue miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Heauens breathing ayre in this Shire is most sweet and delectable, so that for the same
cause many royall Palaces of our Princes are therein seated, and the Countrey better stored with
game then with graine, insomuch that this Countie is by some men compared vnto a home-spunne

when the Land was left to the will of Inuaders, the <HI>South-Saxons</HI> vnder <HI>Ella</HI> here erected
their Kingdome, which with the first was raised, and soonest found end. From them no doubt the

many Princely Houses, yea and fiue of his Majesties, so magnificently built, that of some she may
well say, no Shire hath none such, as is <HI>None-such</HI> indeed. And were not <HI>Richmond</HI> a fatall place of

Emperour, and intirely beloued wife to King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second; the most wise Prince King <HI>Henry</HI>

<P>(6) At <HI>Merton</HI> likewise <HI>Kenulph</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> came to his vntimely end: and at <HI>Lam∣beth</HI>

of keeping the publike Records of the Realme. In the ciuill warres of <HI>Maud</HI> and <HI>Stephen,</HI> this Citie
was sore sacked, but againe receiuing breath, was by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third appointed the place for

in forme Circular, and wall within wall, the foundation vpon a hill so topped, that it cannot
be ascended but by staires, carrying a goodly prospect both by Land and Sea, and in the East with∣out
the walles a goodly Church sometimes stood, called S <HI>Maries,</HI> which was pulled downe, for
that it gaue the <HI>French</HI> direction of course, who with fire had greatly endangered the Towne: in

<HEAD>VVIGHT ILAND.
CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>VVIGHT ILAND was in times past named by the <HI>Romans Vecta, Vectis,</HI> and <HI>Vecte∣sis,</HI>
by the <HI>Britaines, Guyth,</HI> and in these dayes vsually called by vs, <HI>The Ile of Wight.</HI>
It belongeth to the Countrie of <HI>South-hampton,</HI> and lyeth out in length ouer against
the midst of it South-ward. It is encompassed round with the <HI>British.</HI> Seas, and
seuered from the Maine land. that it may seeme to haue beene conjoyned to it,
and thereof it is thought the <HI>Brittish</HI> name <HI>(Guyth)</HI> hath beene giuen vnto it, which betokeneth
separation, euen as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being broken off and cut from <HI>Italy,</HI> got the name from <HI>Secando</HI> (which
signifieth cutting.)</P>
<P>(2) The forme of this Isle is long, and in the middest farre more wide then at eyther end: from
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ile in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Castle in the West it stretcheth out in length 20. miles, and in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Northward, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Southward 12. miles. The whole in circum∣ference
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>(3) The ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is commended both for health and delight, whereof the first is witnessed by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> continuance of the Inhabitants in the state of then bodies before they be decayed, and the o∣ther
for quantitie giues place to no neighbouring Country.</P>
<P>(4) The ground (to say nothing of the Sea, which is exceeding full of fish) consisteth of soile
very fruitfull; yet the husbandmans labour deserues to be thankfully remembred, by whose paines
and industry it doth not onely supply it selfe, but affords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orne to be carryed forth to others.
The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and is plenteously stored with Cattle and Graine, and breeds euery where store of Conies,
<PB REF="29"/>
Hares, Patridges and Phesants, pleasant for medow, pasturage, and Parkes; so that nothing is
wanting that may suffice man. The middest yeelds plentie of pasture; and forrage for Sheepe;
whose wooll the Clothiers esteeme the best; next vnto that of <HI>Leinster</HI> and <HI>Cotteswold:</HI> If you cast
your eyes towards the North, it is all ouer garnished with Meadowes, Pastures, and Woods: If to∣wards
the South side, it lyeth (in a manner) wholy bedecked with Cornefields enclosed, where at
each end the Sea doth so incroach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t selfe. that it maketh almost two Ilands besides, namely, <HI>Fresh∣water
Isle,</HI> which looketh to the West, and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nbridge isle</HI> answering it to the East.</P>
<P>(5) The Commodities of the whole chiefly consist of Cattle, Sea fowle, Fish, and Corne,
whereof it hath sufficient: Woods are not here very plentifull; for that it is onely stored with one
little Forrest; yet the Country of <HI>Hamshire</HI> for vicinitie of Site, is a friendly neighbour in that be∣halfe;
so (as it were being tyed together in affinitie) they are alwayes readie, and propense to adde
to each others wants and defects by a mutuall supply.</P>
<P>(6) The ancient Inhabitants of this Iland were the <HI>Belga,</HI> spoken of in the seuerall Prouinces
of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>merset-shire, Wilt-shire,</HI> and <HI>Hamshire.</HI> Such as did then possesse it were called <HI>Lords of the Isle of
wight,</HI> till it fell into the Kings hands, by <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger</HI> (Sonne to <HI>William Fits Osburne,</HI> slaine in the warre
of <HI>Flanders)</HI> that was driuen into exile. And <HI>Henry</HI> the first King of <HI>England</HI> gaue it vnto <HI>Richard
Riduers,</HI> with the see or Inheritance of the Towne of <HI>Christs-Church,</HI> where (at in all other places)
he built certaine Fortrestes.</P>
<P>(7) The principall Market-Towne in the Isle is <HI>Newport,</HI> called in times past <HI>Medena,</HI> and <HI>No∣vus
Burgus de Meden;</HI> that is, <HI>the new Burgh of Meden,</HI> whereof the whole Countrey is diuided into
East-<HI>Meden,</HI> and West <HI>Meden.</HI> A Towne well seated, and much frequented; vnto whose Burgesles
his Majestie hath lately granted the choyse of a Major, who with his Brethren, doe gouerne accor∣dingly.
It is populous with Inhabitants, hauing an entrance into the Isle from the Hauen, and a
<PB REF="30"/>
passage for Vessels of small burden vnto the Key. Not farre from it is the Castle <HI>Caresbrooke,</HI> whose
founder is said to haue beene <HI>Whitgar</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and from him called <HI>White-Garesburgh:</HI> but now
made shorter for easier pronunciation; the graduation whereof for Latitude is in the degree 50.
36. minutes: and her Longitude in 19. 4. minutes, where, formerly hath stood a Priory, and at
<HI>Quarre</HI> a Nunnery; a necessary neighbour to those Penitentiaries. And yet in their merry mood,
the Inhabitants of this Iland doe boast, that they were happier then their neighbour Countries,
for that they neuer had Monke that euer wore hood, Lawyers that cauilled, nor Foxes that were
craftie.</P>
<P>(8) It is reported, that in the yeare of mans saluation, 1176. and twentie-three of King <HI>Henry</HI>
the second, that in this Iland it rained a showre of bloud, which continued for the space of 2 houres
together to the great wonder and amazement of the people that beheld it with feare.</P>
<P>(9) This Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> is fortified both by Art and Nature: for besides the strength of Artifici∣all
Forts and Blocke-houses (wherewith it is well furnished) it wants not the assistance of naturall
Fences, as being enriched with a continuall ridge and range of craggy Cliffes and Rockes, and
Bankes very dangerous for Saylers, as the <HI>Needles,</HI> so called by reason of their sharpnesse: The
<HI>Shingles, Mixon, Brambles, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>(10) <HI>Vespasian</HI> was the first that brought it to the subiection of the <HI>Romaenes,</HI> whilest he serued
as a priuate person vnder <HI>Claudius Caesar.</HI> And <HI>Cerdic</HI> was the first <HI>English Saxon</HI> that subdued it, who
granting it vnto <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffe</HI> and <HI>Whitgar,</HI> they joyntly together slew (almost) all the <HI>Brittish</HI> Inhabi∣tants
(being but few of them, there remaining) in the Towne aforesaid, called of his Name <HI>Whit∣garesburgh.
Wolpher</HI> King of the <HI>Merciam</HI> reduced this Iland afterwards vnder his obedience, and
at that time when he became God-father to <HI>Edelwalch</HI> King of the <HI>South-Saxons,</HI> and answered for
him at his Baptisme; he assigned it ouer vnto him, with the Prouince also of the <HI>Menuari.</HI> But when
<PB REF="30"/>
<HI>Edelwalch</HI> was slaine, and <HI>Aruandus</HI> the petty King of the Iland was made away, <HI>Coedwalla</HI> King of
the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> annexed it to his Dominion, and in a tragicall and lamentable Massacre put to the
sword (almost) euery mothers childe of the in-borne Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The thing that is best worthy note and obseruation is this, That Bishop <HI>Wilfrid</HI> was the first that
instructed the Inhabitants of this Iland in Christian Religion, and brought them from Idolatrous
Superstition, with the which (vnto that time) they were obscurely blinded.</P>
<P>For Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, this Countrey belongeth to the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and for Ci∣uill
gouernment to the Countie of <HI>South-hampton.</HI> It is fortified with the strength of sixe Castles,
traded with three Market-Townes, and hath 36. Parish-Churches planted in it.

<HEAD>DORCESTER-SHIRE.
CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>DORCESTER, from her ancient people DVROTRIGES, is most likely to haue receiued
that name: by the <HI>Britaines</HI> called DVVRGVVEIR, lyeth bounded vpon the North-side
with <HI>Somerset</HI> and <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt-shire;</HI> vpon the West with <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>shire,</HI> and some part with <HI>Somerset;</HI>
vpon the East altogether with <HI>Hampshire:</HI> and her South part is wholly bounded with the
<HI>British Seas.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme growes wider from the West, and spreads her selfe the broadest in the midst,
where it extends to twentie-foure miles, but in length is no lesse then fortie-foure: the whole in
Circumference about, is one hundred and fiftie miles.</P>
<P>(3) The ayre is good, and of an healthfull constitution: the soyle is fat, affording many com∣modities,
and the Countrey most pleasant in her situation: for the In-land is watered with many
sweet and fresh running Springs, which taking passage thorow the plaine Vallies, doe lastly in a lo∣uing
manner vnite themselues together, and of their many branches make many bigge bodied
streames: neither doth the Sea deny them entrance, but helpeth rather to fill vp their Bankes,
whereby Vessels of burden discharge their rich Treasures, and her selfe with open hand distributeth
her gifts all along the South of this Shore.</P>
<P>(4) Anciently it was possest by the <HI>Durotriges,</HI> whom <HI>Ptolemie</HI> placeth along in this Tract, who
being subdued by the <HI>Romans,</HI> yeelded them roome, and vnwilling subiection. After them the <HI>Sax∣ons</HI>
set foot in these parts, whereof <HI>Portland</HI> seemeth from that <HI>Port</HI> to take name, who in this place
arriued in <HI>Anno</HI> 703. and did sorely infest and annoy all the South Tract. And at <HI>Bindon</HI> before him
<PB REF="32"/>
<HI>Kinegillus</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> in the yeare of Christ 614. in a doubtfull and dangerous Battle
vanquished the <HI>Britaines</HI> Neither were the <HI>Saxons</HI> so surely herein seated, but that the <HI>Danes</HI> sought
to defeat them thereof: for twice these bold <HI>Rouers</HI> landed at <HI>Chartmouth,</HI> the first was in <HI>Anno</HI> 831.
and raigne of King <HI>Egbert;</HI> and the other eight yeares after, when <HI>Ethelwulfe</HI> was King: in both
which they went away <HI>Victors.</HI> Yet when the <HI>Iron-side</HI> wore the <HI>English Diademe,</HI> and these fierce
people sought to plucke it from his <HI>Helmet,</HI> he met them at <HI>Pen ham</HI> in <HI>Gillingham Forrest,</HI> and with
a small power obtained a great victory, causing their King <HI>Canute</HI> with discourage to retire.</P>
<P>(5) Commodities arising in this Countie are chiefly <HI>Wools</HI> and <HI>Woods</HI> in her North, where the
<HI>Forrests</HI> are stored with the one, and the pleasant greene Hilles with the other. The inner part is o∣uer-spread
both with <HI>Corne</HI> and <HI>Grasse,</HI> and the Sea yeeldeth the <HI>Isidis Plocamos,</HI> a Shrub growing
not vnlike the <HI>Corrall</HI> without any leafe; besides her other gifts, turning all to great gaine: which
the more is made manifest by the many Market. Townes in this Shire, whereof <HI>Dorchester</HI> is the
chiefe, in <HI>Antonius</HI> his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> termed <HI>Durnouaria,</HI> situated vpon the South side of <HI>Frome,</HI> and

some part yet standeth, especially vpon the West and South sides, and the Tract and Trench most
apparent in a Quadrant-wise almost meeteth the Riuer, containing in circuit one thousand and se∣uen
hundred pases, but were cast downe by the <HI>Danes,</HI> whose tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pling feete destroyed all things
wheresoeuer they came, and hands here razed the Trenches <HI>Mandbury</HI> and <HI>Poundbury,</HI> theseales of
their Siege, and signes of times miserie. About three hundred pases Southward from hence, stan∣deth
an old Fortification of Earth, trenched about, and mounted aboue the ordinary plaine, thirtie
pases, containing some fiue Acres of ground; wherein (at my there-being) plentie of <HI>Corne</HI> grew.
This the Inhabitants call <HI>The Maiden-Castle,</HI> hauing entrance thereunto onely vpon the East and
<PB REF="32"/>
West This is thought to haue beene a Summer-Campe or Station of the <HI>Romans,</HI> when their <HI>Gar∣risons</HI>
kept the Frontiers of this Prouince.</P>
<P>The gouernment of this City is yearely committed to two <HI>Bailiffes,</HI> elected out of eight <HI>Magistrates</HI>
or <HI>Aldermen,</HI> a <HI>Recorder, Towr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Clerke,</HI> and two <HI>Sergeants</HI> attending them: whence the North-pole
is eleuated 50. degrees 48. minutes in Latitude, and for Longitude is remooued from the first
West-point vnto the Meridian of 18. degrees.</P>
<P>(6) Other places also are memorable through the actions therein happening, or antiquities
there yet remaining: such is <HI>Badbury,</HI> now nothing but a <HI>Trench</HI> and decayed <HI>Castle,</HI> hardly seene,
though sometimes it was the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>West-Saxons Kings.</HI> Such also is <HI>Cerne,</HI> where <HI>Augustine</HI> the
English Apostle brake downe the <HI>Altars</HI> and <HI>Idols</HI> of the <HI>Saxons God</HI> HELL, whom they deuoutly
honoured as the onely conseruer of their health. <HI>Shaftesbury</HI> also, wherein one <HI>Aquila</HI> (whether
a <HI>Man</HI> or <HI>Eagle</HI> I know not) by our <HI>Historians</HI> report, is said to haue prophecied the future times of
this our Empire, and that after the raignes of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Norman▪</HI> it should againe returne vnto
the gouernment of the <HI>British Kings.</HI> But with such vaine predictions our Nation is more then once
taxed by <HI>Philip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> Writer. In this Citie <HI>Edward</HI> the sonne of great <HI>Edgar,</HI>

seated in the Ile of <HI>Purbeck,</HI> by his Step-mother <HI>Aelfrith,</HI> to make way for her sonne to enioy his
Crowne: in repentance whereof, and to pacifie Heauen for his bloud, she built the <HI>Monasteries</HI> of
<HI>Ambresbury</HI> and <HI>Whorwell,</HI> in the Countie of <HI>Wilt-shire</HI> and <HI>South-Hamton.</HI> In the former of which
with great penitency she spent the rest of her life.</P>
<P>(7) As vpon the like occasion the Monastery of <HI>Middleton</HI> was laied in this Shire by King <HI>E∣thelstan</HI>
to appease the <HI>Ghost</HI> of <HI>Edwine</HI> his innocent brother, and to expiate the sinne of his owne

<HEAD>DEVON-SHIRE.
CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>DEVON-SHIRE, by the <HI>Cornish Britaines</HI> called <HI>Deuinan;</HI> and by contraction of the vulgar
<HI>Denshire,</HI> is not deriued from the <HI>Danes,</HI> as some would haue it, but from the people <HI>Dan∣monij,</HI>
the same we will speake of in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and whom <HI>Ptolemie</HI> hath seated in these Westerne
Borders.</P>
<P>(2) The West of this County is bounded altogether by the Riuer <HI>Tamar:</HI> the East is held
in with the verge of <HI>Somerset-shire:</HI> and the North and South sides are washed wholy with the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
and <HI>Severne Seas:</HI> Betwixt whose shoares from <HI>Cunshere</HI> in the North, vnto <HI>Salcombe Hauen</HI> en∣tering
in at the South, are fiftie fiue miles: and from the <HI>Hartland Point</HI> West, to <HI>Thorncombe</HI> East,
are fiftie foure: the whole Circumference about two hundred and two miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Ayre is sharpe, healthfull and good: the Soile is hilly, wooddy and fruitfull, yet so as
the hand of the Manurer must neuer be idle, nor the purse of the Farmer neuer fast shut, especially
of them that are farre from the Sea, whence they fetch a sand with charge and much trauell, which
being spread vpon the face of the earth, bettereth the leannesse thereof for graine, and giueth life to
the Glebe with great efficacy.</P>
<P>(4) As <HI>Cornwall,</HI> so this hath the same commodities that arise from the Seas: and being more in∣landed
hath more commodious Hauens for Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppings entercourse, among whom <HI>Totnes</HI> is famous
for <HI>Brutes</HI> first entrance, if <HI>Geffry</HI> say true, or if <HI>Hau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llan</HI> the Poet tooke not a Poeticall libertie, when
speaking of <HI>Brute,</HI> he wrote thus:
<Q><L>The Gods did guide his sayle and course: the winds were at command:</L>
<L>And <HI>Totnes</HI> was the happie shoare where first he came on land.</L></Q>
<PB REF="34"/>
But with more credit and lamentable euent, the <HI>Danes</HI> at <HI>Teigne-mouth</HI> first entred for the inuasion
of this Land, about the yeare of Christ 787. vnto whom <HI>Brightrik</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> sent the
<HI>Steward</HI> of his house to know their intents, whom resistantly they slew: yet were they forced backe
to their Ships by the Inhabitants, though long they stayed not, but eagerly pursued their begun en∣terprises▪</P>
<P>With more happie successe hath <HI>Plimouth</HI> set forth the purchasers of same, and stopped the en∣trance
of <HI>Englands</HI> Inuaders, as in the Raigne of that eternized Queene, the mirrour of Princes,
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> of euerlasting memory: for from this Port Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> that potent man at Sea, set∣ting
forth <HI>Anno</HI> 1577 in the space of two yeares and ten moneths did compasse the circle of the
earth by Sea. And the Lord <HI>Charles Howard, Englands</HI> high Admirall, did not onely from hence
impeach the entrance of the proud inuincible <HI>Spanish Nauy,</HI> intending inuasion and subuersion of
State, but with his Bullets so signed their passage; that their sides did well shew in whose hands they
had beene, as seales of their owne shame, and his high honour.</P>
<P>(5) The commodities of this Shire consist much in Wools and Clothings, where the best and
finest Kersies are made in the Land Corne is most plenteous in the fruitfull Vallies, and Cattle
spreading vpon the topped Hils; Sea Fish and Fowle exceedingly abundant. Veynes of Lead, yea
and some of Siluer in this Shire are found: and the Load-stone (not the least for vse and esteeme)
from the Rocks vpon <HI>Dart-more</HI> hath beene taken Many fresh Springs doe bubble from the Hils in
this Prouince, which with a longing desire of Socretie search out their passage, till they meete and
conjoyne in the Vallies, and gathering still strength with more branches, lastly grow bodyed able
to beare Ships into the Land, and to lodge them of great burthen in their Bosomes or Fals: where∣of

Father in God <HI>William</HI> now Bishop of the <HI>Diocesse</HI> with great cost hath repaired; whom I may not
name without a most thankfull remembrance for the great benefits receiued by his carefull proui∣dence
toward me and mine. This Citie was so strong and so well stored of <HI>Britaines,</HI> that they held
out against the <HI>Saxons</HI> for 465. yeares after their first entrance, and was not absolutely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vntill
<HI>Athelstan</HI> became Monarch of the whole, who then peopled it with his <HI>Saxons,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
beautie thereof with many faire buildings: but in the times of the <HI>Danish</HI> desolations this Citie with
the rest, felt their destroying hands; for in the yeare 875. it was by them fore afflicted, spoyled, and
shaken, and that most grieuously by <HI>Swane</HI> in the yeare of Christ Iesus 1003. who razed it downe
from East to West, so that scarcely had it gotten breath before <HI>William</HI> the bastard of <HI>Normandy be∣sieged</HI>
it, against whom the Citizens with great manhood serued, till a part of the wall fell downe
of it selfe, and that by the hand of Gods prouidence, saith mine Author: since when it hath beene
<PB REF="35"/>
three times besieged, and with valiant resistance euer defended. The first was by <HI>Hugh Courtney,</HI>
Earle of <HI>Deuenshire,</HI> in the Ciuill broyles betwixt <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Yorke:</HI> then by <HI>Perbin Warbeck,</HI> that
counterfeited <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Yorke:</HI> and lastly, by the <HI>Cornish</HI> Rebels, wherein although the Citizens
were grieuously pinched with scarsitie, yet continued they their faithfull allegeance vnto King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the sixt; and at this day flourisheth in tranquillitie and wealth, being gouerned by a Major,
twentie-foure Brethren, with a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and other Officers their Attendants.
This Cities graduation is set in the degree of Latitude from the North-Pole 50. and 45. scruples:
and for Longitude from the West, to the degree 16. and 25. scruples. Neither is <HI>Ioseph</HI> that excel∣lent

<P>(7) Places memorable in this Countie remaining for signes of Battles, or other antiquities are
these: vpon <HI>Exmore</HI> certaine Monuments of Anticke-worke are erected, which are stones pitched in
order, some triangle-wise, and some in round compasse: these no doubt were trophies of victories
there obtained, eyther by the <HI>Romans, Saxons,</HI> or <HI>Danes,</HI> and with <HI>Danish</HI> letters one of them is in∣scribed,
giuing direction to such as should trauell that way. <HI>Hublestowe</HI> likewise neere vnto the

the <HI>English</HI> in diuers parts of the Land: but lastly was there encountred with, and slaine by this
Shires Inhabitants, and vnder a heape of copped stones interred, and the Banner <HI>Reasen</HI> there and

<HEAD>CORNWALL.
CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>CORNWALL (as <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> affirmeth) is so named partly from the forme,
and partly from her people: for shooting it selfe into the Sea like a <HI>Horne</HI> (which the <HI>Bri∣taines</HI>

then to recouer health. The spring is not so early as in the more Easterne parts; yet the Sum∣mer
with a temperate heat recompenceth his slow fostering of the fruits, with their most kindly
ripening. The Autumne bringeth a somewhat late haruest: and the Winter, by reason of the Seas
warme breath, maketh the cold milder then else-where. Notwithstanding that Countrey is much
subiect to stormy blasts, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e violence hath freedome from the open waues, to beat vpon the dwel∣lers

<P>(3) The Soile for the most part is lifted vp into many hilles, parted a sunder with narrow and
short vallies, and a shallow earth doth couer their out-side, which by a <HI>Sea-weede</HI> called <HI>Orewood,</HI> and

<HEAD>SVMMERSET-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>SVVMMERSET-SHIRE is both a rich and spacious Countrey, hauing the <HI>Seuerne Sea</HI> beating
vpon it on the North-side, the South part bordering vpon <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Dorset shires,</HI> the West
confined with <HI>Deuon-shire,</HI> and the East and North-East vpon <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and <HI>Gloucester-shire.</HI>
It tooke the name of <HI>Sommerton</HI> (sometime the chiefe Towne of this Shire) whence in the
ancient Historian <HI>Asserius,</HI> this Countie is called <HI>Sommertunensis,</HI> that is, <HI>Sommertun-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is large, bearing it selfe still wider as it stretcheth into the middle part
thereof, and containes in length from <HI>Brackley</HI> neere vnto <HI>Frome-Selwood</HI> Eastward, to <HI>Oure</HI> in the
West, Miles 55. In breadth from <HI>Porshut point</HI> in the North, to <HI>Chard</HI> Southward, is somewhat a∣boue
fortie miles. The whole circumference is about 204. miles.</P>
<P>(3) The ayre is milde and pleasing, and for the most part subiect to such temperate dispositions
as the Sommer-season affordeth, whence some haue erroniously conceited, that the Region borrow∣ed
her name from the nature of her Clime: yet how delightefull so euer it is in the time of Sommer,
with change of the season it may well change her pleasing name, and borrow some Winterly deno∣mination;
so full of wet, so myrie and moorish it is; in so much as the Inhabitants can hardly tra∣uell
to and fro without their great encumbrance.</P>
<P>(4) Howbeit they passe ouer this with all patience, knowing their ensuing seasonable profits
farre to exceede any present detriments and displeasures: for as it is foule, so it is fruitfull, which
makes them comfort themselues with this Prouerbe, that <HI>What is worst for the Rider, is best for the
Abider:</HI> the Soyle and Globe thereof being very fertile, and euery side garnished with Pastures and
<PB REF="40"/>
delightfull Meadowes, and beautified with Mannor houses both many and fayre; and (in a word)
hath euery thing in it to content the purse, the heart, the eye, at home: and sufficient Ports to giue
entertainment to commodities from abroad.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants that possessed this Prouince were the <HI>Belgae,</HI> who spread themselues
farre and wide, as well here as in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and the inner parts of <HI>Hamshire:</HI> who being branched
from the <HI>Germans,</HI> conferred the names of those places from whence they came, vpon these their
seats where they resided.</P>
<P>(6) The generall profits of this Prouince are Corne and Cattle, wherewith it is so plentifully
stored, as it may challenge any neighbouring Country for the quantitie to make shew of Cattle so
fat, or Graine so rich. Some places are peculiarly enriched by Lead-mines, as <HI>Mindiphiis,</HI> (perchance
so called of the deepe Mynes) by <HI>Leiland</HI> aptly tearmed <HI>Minerarij, Minerall-hils,</HI> which yeeld plenty
of Lead, the most Merchantable Commoditie that is in <HI>England,</HI> and vented into all parts of the
world Some are beautified with Diamons, as S <HI>Vincent Rocke,</HI> whereof there is great plentie, and
so bright of colour, as they might equalize <HI>Indian</HI> Diamonds, if they had their hardnesse yet being
so many and so common, they are lesse sought after or commended</P>
<P>(7) This Country is famoused by three Cities, <HI>Bath, Wels,</HI> and <HI>Bristow</HI> The first takes name
of the hot Bathes, which <HI>Antonine</HI> called <HI>Aqua Solis, The waters of of the Sunne; Stephanus, Badiza;</HI> we
at this day <HI>Bathe,</HI> and the Latinists <HI>Bathonia:</HI> a place of continuall concourse for persons of all de∣grees,
and almost of all diseases, (whence it was sometimes called <HI>Ak<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man cester)</HI> who by diuine pro∣uidence
doe very often finde reliefe there, the Springs thereof by reason of their Minerall and sul∣phurous
passage, being of such exceeding power and medicinable heat, as that they cure and con∣quer
the rebellious stubbornnesse of corrupt humors, in respect of which admirable vertues, some
haue fabled, that they were first conuayed by Magicke Art. To testifie the antiquitie of this place,
<PB REF="41"/>
m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Images and Romane Inscriptions are found in the walles, which can now be hardly read,
they are so worne and eaten into by age. <HI>Wels</HI> (as <HI>Leiland</HI> reporteth) was sometimes called <HI>Theodo∣rodunum,</HI>
but from whence it had that denomination he makes no mention: The name it now bea∣reth
is taken (as some thinke) from the Riuer there, which King <HI>Kinewulph</HI> in his Charter <HI>An</HI> 766.
calleth <HI>Welwe,</HI> or (as others) from the <HI>Wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or <HI>Springs</HI> which there breake forth, and whereupon that
See (vnder whose Iurisdiction is also the Citie of <HI>Bath)</HI> hath beene anciently called <HI>Pontanensis Ec∣clesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
the <HI>Fountaine-Church:</HI> where the <HI>Cathedrall</HI> built by King <HI>Inas</HI> to the memory of S. <HI>Andrew,</HI>
is very beautifull and richly endowed. The Citie is likewise well replenished both with Inhabitants
and seemly buildings. Whose gouernment is managed by a Major yearely elected, a Recorder, and
seuen Maisters, hauing the assistance of sixteene Burgesses, a Towne-Clerke, and two Sergeants at
Mace. Whose Latitude is 51. 20. minutes, and Longitude 17. 31. minutes. <HI>Bristow</HI> is not so anci∣ent,
as it is faire and well seated: The beautie of it being such, as for the bignesse thereof, it scarce
giues place to any Citie of <HI>England,</HI> and doth worthily deserue the <HI>Saxon</HI> name <HI>Bright-stad:</HI> whose
pleasantnesse is the more, by reason that the Riuer <HI>Auon</HI> scowres through the midst of it, which to∣gether
with the benefit of <HI>Sewes</HI> vnder all the streets, cleares the Citie of all noysome filth and vn∣cleannesse.
It is not wholly seated in this Countie of <HI>Sommerset,</HI> but one part thereof in <HI>Gloucester∣shire</HI>
but because it is an entire Countie of it selfe, it denyes subiection vnto eyther, hauing for its
owne gouernment both a Bishop, with a well furnished Colledge, and a Major, with a competent
assistance of Aldermen, and other Officers for Ciuill affaires.</P>
<P>(8) This Prouince hath beene the Theater of many Tragicall euents and bloudy Battels: the
<HI>Danes</HI> did grieuously afflict <HI>Porlock</HI> by cruell Piracies, in the yeare eight hundred eight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sixe. Yet
neere vnto <HI>Pen</HI> a little village <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eighbouring vpon <HI>North Cadbury, Edmund,</HI> surnamed <HI>Iron-side,</HI> gaue
them a notable soyle, as he was pursuing <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tus</HI> from place to place, for vsurping the <HI>Crowne</HI> of
<PB REF="41"/>
<HI>England.</HI> And <HI>Keniwalth</HI> (a <HI>West-Saxon)</HI> in the same place had such a day against the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritaines,</HI> that
they euer after stood in awe of the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> prowesse. <HI>Marianus</HI> relateth that not farre from
<HI>Bridge-water</HI> as the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es</HI> were stragling abroad, <HI>Ealstan</HI> Bishop of <HI>Sherbourne</HI> did so foyle their
Forces in the yeare 845 as their minds were much discomfited, and their powers vtterly disabled.
<HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius</HI> also writeth, that King <HI>Arthur</HI> did so defeat the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> in a battell at <HI>Cadbury,</HI> that it
deserued to be made perpetuously memorable. Neither is <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Badonicus</HI> (now <HI>Bannesdowne)</HI> lesse
famous for <HI>Arthurs</HI> victories. And King <HI>Elfred</HI> in another battell not farre from hence gaue the <HI>Danes</HI>
such an ouerthrow, as he forced them to submission, and induced <HI>Godrus</HI> their King to become a
Christian, himselfe being God-father to him at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ont. So happie is this <HI>Region,</HI> and so behol∣ding
to Nature and Art for her strengths and fortifications, as she hath alwayes beeene able to defend
her selfe, and offend her enemies.</P>
<P>(9) Neither hath it beene lesse honoured with beauteous houses consecrated to Religion: such
was that of <HI>Black-Charons</HI> at <HI>Barelinch</HI> in the first limit of this Shire Westward: and King <HI>Athelstan</HI>
built a Monastery in an Iland called <HI>Muchelney</HI> (that is to say) the <HI>great Iland,</HI> which is betweene
the Riuers <HI>Iuel</HI> and <HI>Pedred,</HI> running together, where the defaced walles and ruines thereof are yet to
be seene King <HI>Henry</HI> the third also erected a Nunnery at <HI>Witham,</HI> which was afterwards the first
house of the <HI>Carthusian</HI> Monkes in <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n</HI> not far off was the second. But aboue all other
for antiquitie, glory, and beautie was the Abbey of <HI>Glaste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bury,</HI> whose beginning is fetcht euen from
<HI>Ioseph</HI> of <HI>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>athea,</HI> which <HI>Deni</HI> Bishop of S. <HI>Dauids</HI> repaired, being fallen to ruine, and King <HI>Inas</HI>
lastly builded a fayre and stately Church in this Monastery, though it be now made euen with the
ground, the ruines onely shewing how great and magnificant a Seat it hath anciently beene; which
seuerall houses were thus beautified by bounteous Princes, for religious purposes, and to retire the
mind from worldly seruices, though blinded times and guides diuerted them to superstitious and
lewd abuses.</P>
<P><PB REF="42"/>
(10) Other memorable places are these, <HI>Camal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> a very steepe hill hard to be ascended which
appeares to haue beene a worke of the <HI>Romans</HI> by diuers Coynes digd vp there, on the top whereof
are seene the lineaments of a large and ancient Castle, which the Inhabitants report to haue beene
the Palace of King <HI>Arthur. Ilchester,</HI> which at the comming of the <HI>Normans</HI> was so populou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that it
had in it an hundred and seuen Burges<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and it appeares to be of great antiquitie by the Romane
<HI>Caesars</HI> Coynes, oftentimes sound there. The Church yard of <HI>Aualonia</HI> or <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re King
<HI>Arthurs</HI> Sepulcher was searcht for by the command of King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, which was found
vnder a stone, with an Inscription vpon it fastned, almost nine foote in the ground. Also <HI>Dunstere,</HI>
where (as is reported) a great Lady obtained of her husband so much Pasture ground in common
by the Towne side, for the good and benefit of the Inhabitants, as she was able in a whole day to
goe about bare-foote.</P>
<P>This Countie is diuided into 42. Hundreds for the disposing of businesse needfull to the State
thereof, wherein are placed 33. Market-Townes, fit for buying and selling, and other affayres of
Commerce. It is fortified with foure Castles, and planted with 385. Parishes, for concourse of di∣uine
seruice.

<HEAD>VVILT-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>VVILT-SHIRE, is enclosed vpon the Northwith <HI>Glocester-shire,</HI> vpon the East is
bounded with <HI>Bark-shire,</HI> vpon the South with <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Hampshire,</HI> and vpon the
West is confronted against partly by <HI>Glocester,</HI> and the rest by <HI>Somerset shires.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s both long and broad; for from <HI>Inglesham</HI> vpon <HI>Tha∣misis</HI>
in the North, to <HI>Burgat Damarum</HI> in the South, are thirtie nine miles: the
broadest part is from <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>termer</HI> Eastward, to the <HI>Shire-stones</HI> in the West, being twentie nine; the
whole in Circumference is one hundred thirtie nine miles.</P>
<P>(3) For Ayre, it is seated in a temperate Climate, both sweet, pleasant, and wholesome; and for
soile (saith <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Sarisbury) is exceeding fertile and plentifull, yea, and that with va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ietie.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The Northerne part which they call <HI>North Wilt shire,</HI> riseth vp into delectable hilles, attired
with large Woods, and watered with cleare Riuers, whereof <HI>Isis</HI> is one, which soone becommeth the
most famous in the Land. The South part is more euen, yeelding abundently grasse and corne;
and is made the more fruitfull by the Riuers <HI>Wily, Adder,</HI> and <HI>Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> The midst of this Countie is
most plaine, and thereby is knowne and commonly called <HI>Salesbury</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and lie so leuall indeed,
that it doth limit the <HI>Horizon:</HI> or hardly can a man see from the one side to the other. These <HI>Plaines</HI>
grase an infinite number of sheepe, whose fleeces and flesh bring in an yearely reuenew to their ow∣ners.</P>
<P>(5) Anciently this Countie was possessed by the <HI>Belga,</HI> who are seated by <HI>Ptolemie</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,
Somerset shire,</HI> and in this Tract; and they (as it seemeth by <HI>Casar)</HI> were of the <HI>Belga</HI> in <HI>Gaul</HI> These
<PB REF="43"/>
(as some hold) were subdued by <HI>Vespasian,</HI> Lieutenant of the second Legion under <HI>Claudius,</HI> when
the foundations of his future greatnesse were in these parts first laid by his many Victories ouer the
<HI>Britaines.</HI> And herein surely the <HI>Romans</HI> seated; for besides <HI>Yan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sburie Trench,</HI> by Tradition held to
be his, in many other Forts in this Shire the Tract of their footing hath beene left, and the stam∣ped
Coines of their Emperours found, an apparent testimony of their abode.</P>
<P>(6) After them the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> made it a part of their Kingdome, whole border was <HI>Auon,</HI> as
witnesseth <HI>Athelward,</HI> though the <HI>Mercians</HI> many times encroched vpon them, whereby many great
Battles, as <HI>Malmesbury</HI> tels vs, betwixt them were fought, when in the young yeares of their <HI>Heptar∣chie</HI>
each sought to enlarge his, by the lessening of the next: but growne vnto more ripenesse, they
assigned their limits by a great and long ditch crossing thorow the middest of these <HI>Plaines,</HI> which
for the wonder thereof is supposed by the vulgar to be the worke of the <HI>Deuill,</HI> and is called of all,
<HI>Wansdike,</HI> vndoubtedly of <HI>Woden,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> Ancestor and great reputed God, where a little village
yet standeth, and retaineth to name <HI>Wodens-burg</HI> At this place, in <HI>Anno 590. Ceaulin</HI> the <HI>West-Sax∣on,</HI>
receiued such a foyle of the <HI>Britaines</HI> and his Countrey-men, that he was forced to forsake his
Kingdome, and to end his dayes in exile, becomming a pittifull spectacle euen vnto his enemies.
And in this place <HI>Ina</HI> the <HI>West-Saxon</HI> joyned Battle with <HI>Ceolred</HI> the <HI>Mercian,</HI> whence both of them
departed with equall losse. The like was at <HI>Bradford</HI> by <HI>Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lwach</HI> and <HI>Cuthred;</HI> at <HI>Wilton,</HI> betwixt
<HI>Egbert</HI> and <HI>Beornwolfe;</HI> at <HI>Edindon,</HI> where King <HI>Elfred</HI> was vanquisher of the <HI>Danes;</HI> and at <HI>Wilton,</HI>
where the <HI>Danes</HI> wonne the day against him. With as bloudy successe, though not happening by
sword, was the issue of that Synod assembled at <HI>Colne,</HI> a small Towne in this Countie, in the yeare
of Christ Iesus 977 where being hotly debating for the single life, and against the marriages of the
<HI>Clergie,</HI> what wanted by the Word to proue their diuorce, was supplyed by a Stratagem, and that ve∣ry
bloudy; for suddenly the maine timber brake, and downe fell the floore with the Nobles and
<PB REF="44"/>
Prelates, the Gentlemen and Commons, whereby a great number were hurt, and many more slaine;
onely <HI>Dunstan</HI> the President and mouth for the Monkes, escaped vntouched, the Ioist whereon his
Chaire stood remaining most firme: which confirmed the sentence of their separations, whom God
had conioyned, and became the fall and snare of much incontinencie in both sexes.</P>
<P>(7) The chiefest Citie of this Shire is <HI>Salesburie,</HI> remoued from a higher, but a farre more con∣uenient
place; whose want of water was not so great in the mother, as is supplied and replenished in
the daughter, euery street almost hauing a Riuer running thorow her middest; and for sumptuous
and delicate buildings, is inferiour to none. The Cathedrall, a most rich magnificent Church, was
begun by <HI>Richard Poore, Bishop,</HI> and with fortie yeares continuante was raised to her perfect beau∣tie:
wherein are as many windowes as there are dayes in the yeare, as many cast pillars of Marble,
as there are houres in the yeare, and as many gates for entrance as there are moneths in the yeare.
Neither doth this Citie retaine true honour to her selfe, but imparteth hers, and receiueth honour
from others, who are intituled <HI>Earles of Salesburie,</HI> whereof eight noble Families haue beene digni∣fied
since the <HI>Normans C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quest.</HI> This Cities situation is in the degree of Latitude 51. 10 minutes,
and from the first West point obserued by <HI>Mercator,</HI> 18 Degrees, and 31. minutes of Longi∣tude.</P>
<P>(8) Ouer this, old <HI>Salesburie</HI> sheweth it selfe, where <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k</HI> ouercame the <HI>Britaines,</HI> and where
<HI>Canutus</HI> the <HI>Dane</HI> did great dammage by fire. This formerly had beene the Seat of the <HI>Romans:</HI> as
likewise was <HI>Lecham,</HI> as by their Coines digged vp is apparant: so were <HI>Brokenbridge</HI> and <HI>Cosham,</HI>
the Courts of the <HI>Saxon Kings</HI> But <HI>Fortune</HI> long since hath turned her face from all these, as lately
she did from many ancient and religious foundations planted in this Prouince, whereof <HI>Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esbu∣rie</HI>
was the most famous I will not with <HI>Monmouth</HI> auouch the foundation thereof vnto <HI>Mulmutius,</HI>
<PB REF="44"/>
but by true Records from <HI>Maidulph</HI> a <HI>Scot,</HI> a man of great learning, that therein built a <HI>Cell,</HI> and lead
an <HI>Hermits</HI> life, whereof <HI>Beda</HI> calleth it the Citie of <HI>Maidulph,</HI> and we by contraction, <HI>Malmesburie,
Adelme</HI> his Disciple and Successor, built here a faire Monastery, which <HI>Athelstan</HI> the Monarch rich∣ly
endowed, and left his body after death there to rest. Neither hath any graced this more then <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
her Monke, in recording to posterities the Chronicles of our Land, concerning both the
Church and Common-weale, wherein himselfe liued and wrote those Histories.</P>
<P>(9) <HI>Ambresburie</HI> for repute did second this, built by <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fritha,</HI> King <HI>Edgar</HI> his wife, to expiate the
sinne of murder which she committed vpon yong <HI>Edward</HI> her sonne in law, that hers might be King.
In this place Queene <HI>Eleanor,</HI> widow to King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, renounced all royall pompe, and de∣uoted
her selfe vnto God in the habit of a Nunne. Other places erected for pietie, were at <HI>Salesbu∣rie,
Lacock, Stanley, Wilton, Luichurch, Farnleg, Bradstole, Briopune,</HI> and <HI>Brombore.</HI> These grafts growne
to full greatnesse, were cut downe by the Pruiner, least the cankers thereof should infect the whole
body (as by them was alledged) and their Reuenewes bestowed vpon farre better vses, both for
the bringing vp of youth, and the maintenance of estate.</P>
<P>(10) With eight strong Castles this Countie hath beene guarded; in nineteene Market-Townes
her commodities are traded: into twentie-nine Hundreds for businesse is diuided, and in them are
seated three hundred and foure Parish-Churches.

<P>(2) The forme of this Shire doth somewhat resemble a <HI>Sandall</HI> for a mans foot, lying long-wise
from East to West, in which part she is broadest, the middle most narrow, and then spreading wi∣der
like to the heele: though for her rich endowments and stately magnificence, it may be well ac∣counted
the heart of the whole.</P>
<P>(3) The length thereof from <HI>Inglesham</HI> in the West, to old <HI>Windsor</HI> in the East, extendeth vnto

the whole in Circumference, about one hundred and twentie miles.</P>
<P>(4) The Ayre is temperate, sweet, and delightfull, and prospect for pleasure inferiour to none;
the Soile is plenteous of corne, especially in the Vale of <HI>White-horse,</HI> that yeeldeth yearely an admira∣ble

<P>(7) A Castle and Towne of greater strength and antiquitie was <HI>Wallingford,</HI> by <HI>Antonie</HI> and
<HI>Ptolemie</HI> called <HI>Galtena,</HI> the chiefest Citie of the <HI>Attribatians,</HI> whose large circuit, and strong forti∣fications,
shew plainly, that it was a place of the <HI>Romans</HI> abode, and since in a conceiued safetie hath
<PB REF="46"/>
made many very bold, especially when the sparkes of <HI>Englands</HI> ciuill dissentions were forced to flame
in case of the <HI>Crowne</HI> betwixt <HI>Maud</HI> the Empresse and King <HI>Stephen,</HI> whither her selfe and associates
resorted as their surest defence.</P>
<P>(8) But of farre greater magnificence and state is the Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> a most Princely Palace
and Mansion of his Maiestie. I will not with <HI>Ieffrey</HI> affirme it to be built by King <HI>Arthur,</HI> but with
better authoritie say, it was so thirsted after by the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> that by a composition with the Abbat
of <HI>Westminster,</HI> whose then it was, he made it to be the Kings Possession, as a Place besides the plea∣sures,
very commodious to entertaine the King In this Castle that victorious Prince King <HI>Edward</HI>
the third was borne; and herein after he had subdued the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> held he at one and the
same time, as his Prisoners, <HI>Iohn</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Dauid</HI> King of <HI>Scotland</HI> Neither was it euer
graced with greater Maiestie then by the institution of the most honourable Order of the Garter,
a signall Ornament of Martiall Prowesse: the inuention thereof some ascribe to be from a Garter
falling from his Queene, or rather from <HI>Ioan</HI> Countesse of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> a Lady of an incomparable
beautie, as she danced before him, whereat the by-standers sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, he gaue the impresse to checke
all euill conceits, and in golden Letters imbelished the Garter with this French Posie, HONI
SOIT QVI MALY PENSE. And yet that worthy <HI>Clarenceaux</HI> alledging the booke of the first
institution, findes the inuention to be more ancient, as when King <HI>Richard</HI> the first warred against
the <HI>Turkes, Saracens, Cypres,</HI> and <HI>Acon,</HI> he girt the legs of certaine choise Knights with a tache of lea∣ther,
which promised a future glory to the wearers. The most Princely Chappell thereof is graced
with the bodies of those two great Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt, and <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, whom the whole
Kingdome was too little to containo, the one of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the other of <HI>Yorke,</HI> where they rest now
vnited in one mould, with a branch of both those Houses, euen King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, who there ly∣eth
also interred, and rests in the Lord.</P>
<P><PB REF="47"/>
(9) Other places of note in this Shire are <HI>Sinodum</HI> in the North, and <HI>Watham</HI> in the East, both
of them places of the <HI>Romans</HI> residence, as by their monyes these oftentimes found appeareth. Nei∣ther
was <HI>Sunning</HI> the least in this Tract, that had beene the Seat of eight Bishops before the See was
translated thence vnto <HI>Shirburne,</HI> or that to <HI>Salisbury▪ Wantage</HI> also is not wanting of honour, in
bringing to life that learned and most valiant King <HI>Ealfred,</HI> the scourge of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and great <HI>Mo∣narch</HI>
of the <HI>English.</HI> And <HI>Finchhamsted</HI> for wonder inferiour to none, where (as our Writers doe
witnesse) that in the yeare, a thousand one hundred, a Well boyled vp with streames of bloud, and
fifteene dayes together continued that <HI>Spring,</HI> whose waters made red all others where they came,
to the great amazement of the beholders.</P>
<P>(10) The riches and sweet seats that this Country affordeth, made many deuout persons to shew
their deuotions vnto true pietie, in erecting places for Gods diuine seruice, and their exemptions
from all worldly businesse: such were <HI>Abington, Redding, Bysham, Bromehall, Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey, Hamme,</HI> and
<HI>Wallingford,</HI> whose <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tarie</HI> abusing the intents of their Founders, ouerthrew both their owne Or∣ders
and places of professions; all which were dissolued by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and giuen the King to
dispose at his will.</P>
<P>This Shires diuision is into twentie Hundreds, and hath beene strengthened with six strong Ca∣stles,
is yet graced with three of his Maiesties most Princely Houses, and traded with twelue Market
Townes, and is replenished with one hundred and fortie Parishes.

<P>MIDDLESEX, so called in regard of the situation, as seated betwixt the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> and

<P>(2) The length thereof extended from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the East, to <HI>Morehall</HI> vpon <HI>Colne</HI> in the West,
is by measure nineteene English miles; and from <HI>South</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the North, to his Majesties Man∣nour
of <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> in the South, are little aboue sixteene miles, the whole Circumference ex∣tending
to ninetie miles</P>
<P>(3) In fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e it is almost square, for ayre passing temperate, for soile abundantly fertile, and for
pasturage and graine of all kindes yeelding the best, so that the Wheat of this Countie hath serued
a long time for the manch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to our Princes Table.</P>
<P>(4) It lyeth seated in a vale most wholesome and rich hauing some hils also, and them of good

<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to <HI>Caesar,</HI> were the <HI>Trinobants,</HI> whom he nameth to be the
most puissant in the Iland; whose chiefe Citie and State yeelding him subiection, made the whole,
with lesse losse to the <HI>Romans,</HI> to beare the yoke of their owne bondage, and to come in vnder
termes of truce. But when their forces in these parts were spent, and the Empire shaken by intestine
<PB REF="48"/>
warres, the <HI>Saxons</HI> setting their eyes vpon so faire a soile, made their footing as sure herein; which
lastly with <HI>Hartford</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> was the portion of the <HI>East-Saxons</HI> Kingdome.</P>
<P>(6) Fiue Princely Houses, inheritable to the <HI>English</HI> Crowne, are seated in this Shire, which are,
<HI>Enfield, Hanworth, White-hall,</HI> S. <HI>Iames,</HI> and <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> a Citie rather in shew then the Palace of
a Prince, and for stately <HI>Port</HI> and gorgeous building, not inferiour to any in <HI>Europe.</HI> At <HI>Thistleworth</HI>
once stood the Palace of <HI>Richard</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> Earle of <HI>Cornewall,</HI> which the <HI>Lond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner</HI> in a

built and pleasantly seated, as the like in the like circuit are no where else to be found.
Neere vnto <HI>Thamesis</HI> entrance into this Countie, is kept the remembrance of <HI>Caesars</HI> entrance ouer

<HI>Cedars</HI> among other trees, being the seat of the <HI>British Kings,</HI> the chamber of the <HI>English,</HI> the modell
of the Land, and the Mart of the world: for thither are brought the silke of <HI>Asia,</HI> the spices from <HI>A∣frica,</HI>
the Balmes from <HI>Grecia,</HI> and the riches of both the <HI>Indies</HI> East and West: no Citie standing so
long in same, nor any for diuine and politicke gouernment may with her be compared Her walls
were first set by great <HI>Constantine</HI> the first <HI>Christian Emperour,</HI> at the suit of his mother, Qu: <HI>Helen,</HI>
reared with rough stone and <HI>British</HI> Bricke three English miles in compasse: thorow which are now

made seauen most faire gates, besides three other passages for entrance. Along the <HI>Thamesis,</HI> this wall
at first ranged and with two gates opened, the one <HI>Doure-gate,</HI> now <HI>Dowgate,</HI> and the other <HI>Billins∣gate,</HI>
a receptacle for Ships. In the midst of this wall was set a mile-marke (as the like was in <HI>Rome)</HI>
from whence were measured their stations, for carriage or otherwise; the same as yet standeth, and
hath beene long knowne by the name of <HI>London Stone.</HI> Vpon the East of this Citie, the Church of
S. <HI>Peters</HI> is thought to be the Cathedrall of <HI>Restitus,</HI> the Christians Bishops See, who liued in the
raigne of Great <HI>Constantine;</HI> but since S. <HI>Pauls</HI> in the West part, from the Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> assu∣med
that dignitie, whose greatnesse doth exceed any other at this day, and spires so high that twice
it hath beene consumed by lightning from heauen. Besides this Cathedrall, God is honoured in
one hundred twentie one Churches more in this Citie: that is, ninetie six within the wals; sixteene
without, but within the Liberties; and nine more in her Suburbs; and in <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z. Stephens</HI> time, thir∣teene
Conuents of religious Orders. It is diuided into 26 Wards, gouerned by so many graue <HI>Al∣dermen,</HI>
a <HI>Lord Maior,</HI> and two <HI>Sherifs,</HI> the yearely choice whereof was granted them by Patent from
King <HI>Iohn;</HI> in whose time also a Bridge of stone was made ouer <HI>Thames,</HI> vpon nineteene Arches, for
length, breadth, beautie, and building, the like againe not found in the world.</P>
<P>(8) This <HI>London</HI> (as it were) disdaning bondage, hath set her selfe on each side, far without the
walls, and hath lefther West-gate in the midst, from whence with continuall buildings (still affec∣ting
greatnesse) she hath continued her streets vnto a Kings Palace, and ioyned a second Citie to
her selfe, famous for the Seat and Sepulchre of our Kings; and for the Gates of Iustice, that termely
there are opened, onely once a Bishops See, whose title died with the man. No walls are set about
this Citie, and those of <HI>London</HI> are left, to shew rather what it was, then what it is: Whose Citizens,
as the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> did, doe impute their strength in their men, and not in their wals, how strong
toeuer. Or else for their multitude, cannot be circulated, but (as another <HI>Ierusalem)</HI> is inhabited
<PB REF="49"/>
without walls, as <HI>Zachary</HI> said. The wealth of this Citie (as <HI>Isay</HI> once spake of <HI>Nilus)</HI> growes from
the Reuenewes and haruest of her South-bounding <HI>Thames;</HI> whose traffique for merchandizing, is
like that of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> whereof <HI>Ezekiel</HI> speakes, and stands in abundance of Siluer, Iron, Tinne, and
Lead, &amp;c. And from <HI>London</HI> her channell is nauigable, straitned along with medowing borders,
vntill she taketh her full libertie in the <HI>German</HI> Seas. Vpon this <HI>Thamesis</HI> the Ships of <HI>Tharsis</HI> seeme
to ride, and the Nauy, that rightly is termed the <HI>Lady</HI> of the Sea, spreads her saile. Whence twice
with luckie successe hath beene accomplished, the compassing of the vniuersall Globe. This Riuer,
<HI>Canutus,</HI> laying siege against <HI>London,</HI> sought by digging to diuert, and before him the <HI>Danes</HI> had done
great harmes in this Citie, yet was their State recouered by King <HI>Elfred,</HI> and the Riuer kept her olde
course, notwithstanding that cost. In the times of the <HI>Normans,</HI> some ciuill broiles haue beene at∣tempted
in this Citie, as in the dayes of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> whereinto his Barons entred, and the Tower
yeelded vnto <HI>Lewis.</HI> And againe, <HI>Wat Tyler</HI> herein committed outragious cruelties, but was wor∣thily
struck downe by the <HI>Maior</HI> and slaine in <HI>Smithfield.</HI> This Cities graduation for Latitude is the

<HEAD>ESSEX.
CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>ESSEX, by the <HI>Normans exsessa,</HI> and by the vulgar <HI>Essex;</HI> is a Countie large in compasse, very
populous, and nothing inferiour to the best of the Land.</P>
<P>(2) The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orme thereof is somewhat Circular, excepting the East part, which shooteth her
selfe with many Promontories into the Sea; and from <HI>Horsey Iland</HI> to <HI>Haidon</HI> in the West,
(the broadest part of the Shire) are by measure fortie miles; and the length from <HI>East-Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
vpon <HI>Thamesis</HI> in the South, to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urmere</HI> vpon the Riuer <HI>Stow</HI> in the North, are thirtie-fiue miles;
the whole in Circumference one hundred fortie sixe miles.</P>
<P>(3) It lyeth bounded vpon the North, with <HI>Suffolke</HI> and <HI>Cambridge-Shires,</HI> vpon the West with
<HI>Hertford</HI> and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> vpon the South by <HI>Thamesis</HI> is parted from <HI>Kent,</HI> and the East-side thereof
is altogether washed with the <HI>German Sea.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The ayre is temperate and pleasant onely towards the waters somewhat aguish: the soile is
rich and fruitfull, though in some places sandy and barren; yet so that it neuer frustrates the husband∣mans
hopes, or fils not the hands of her haruest-labourers: but in some part so fertile, that after three
yeares glebe of Saffron, the Land for 18. more, will yeeld plentie of Barley, without either dung or
other fatning earth</P>
<P>(5) Her ancient Inhabitants knowne to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> were by <HI>Caesar</HI> called the <HI>Trinobants,</HI> of
whom in the former <HI>Chapter</HI> we haue spoken, and in our <HI>History</HI> shall speake more at large. But this
name perished with the age of the Empire, the <HI>Saxons</HI> presently framed a new; and with <HI>Hertford</HI> and
<HI>Middlesex</HI> made it their <HI>East-Saxons</HI> Kingdome, vntill that <HI>Egbert</HI> brought this and the whole into
an entire and absolute Monarchy: the <HI>Daues</HI> after them laid so sore for this Prouince, that at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eam∣fleet</HI>
<PB REF="51"/>
and <HI>Hauenet</HI> (now <HI>Shobery)</HI> they fortified most strongly; and at <HI>Barklow,</HI> (besides the hils moun∣ted
for their burials) the <HI>Danewort</HI> with her red beryes, so plentifully grow, that it is held and ac∣counted
to spring from the bloud of the <HI>Danes</HI> which in that place was spilt, and the hearb as yet is
called from them the <HI>Danes-bloud;</HI> neither yet were they quelled to surcease that quarrell; but at <HI>Ash∣downe</HI>
abode the <HI>Iron-side</HI> in fight, wherein so much bloud of the <HI>English</HI> was spilt, that <HI>Canutus</HI> their
King in remorse conscience, built a Church in the place, to pacifie God for the sinnes of his peo∣ple:
But when the <HI>Normans</HI> had got the garland of the whole, many of their Nobles there seated them∣selues,
whose posterities since, both there and else-where, are spread further abroad in the Realme.</P>
<P>(6) The Commodities that this Shire yeeldeth, are many and great, as of Woods, Corne, Cat∣tle,
Fish, Forests, and Saffron; which last groweth with such gaine and increase vpon her North
parts, that from a split cloue much like vnto Garlicke, a white blewish Flower shortly springeth,
from whence fillets of Saffron are gathered before the Sunne, and dryed, are sold as spice with great
gaine. From the Ilands <HI>Canuey, Mersey, Horsey, Northly, Osey, Wallot,</HI> and <HI>Foulnesse,</HI> great store of
Fish and Fowle are daily gotten: and so from their Cattle haue they continuall increase, which men
and boyes milke; as well the Ewe as the Kine; whereof they make great and thicke Cheese, sold a∣broad
in the Land, and much thereof transported into other Countries. Their Oysters which we
call <HI>Walfleete,</HI> the best in esteeme, and are thought from <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e</HI> to haue beene serued in the <HI>Romans</HI>
Kitchins. But least we should exceed measure in commending, or the people repose their trust in the
soyle; behold what God can doe, to frustrate both in a moment, and that by his meanest creatures:
for in our age and remembrance, the yeare of Christ 1581. an Army of <HI>Mice</HI> so ouer ranne the
Marshes in <HI>Dengey Hundred,</HI> neere vnto <HI>South-minster</HI> in this Countie, that they shore the grasse to
the very roots, and so tainted the same with their venemous teeth, that a great Murraine fell vpon
the Cattle which grased thereon, to the great losse of their owners.</P>
<P><PB REF="51"/>
(7) The chiefest Citie for account at this day, in this Shire, is <HI>Colchester,</HI> built by <HI>Coilus</HI> the <HI>Brit∣ish</HI>
Prince, one hundred twentie-foure yeares after the birth of our <HI>Sauiour Christi</HI> (if he of <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mouth</HI>
say true) wherein his sonne <HI>Lucius, Helena,</HI> and <HI>Constantine,</HI> the first Christian <HI>King, Empresse,</HI> and
<HI>Emperour</HI> in the world, were borne: which made <HI>Necham</HI> for <HI>Consiantine</HI> to sing as he did.</P>
<Q><L>From <HI>Colchester</HI> there rose a Starre,</L>
<L>The Rayes whereof gaue glorious light</L>
<L>Throughout the world in climates farre,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Constantine, Romes</HI> Emperour bright.</L></Q>
<P>And the <HI>Romanes</HI> to the great honour of <HI>Helena</HI> inscribed her, <HI>Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssima Venerabilis Augusta.</HI> But
of these we shall be occasioned to speake more hereafter. This Citie is situated vpon the South of
the Riuer <HI>Coln;</HI> from whence it hath the name, and is walled about, raised vpon a high Trench of
earth, though now much decayed, hauing six gates of entrance, and three posternes in the West wall,
besides nine Watch-Towers for defence, and containeth in compasse 1980 paces; wherein stand
eight faire Churches, and two other without the walls, for Gods diuine seruice: S <HI>Tenants</HI> and the
<HI>Blacke Fryers</HI> decayed in the Suburbs; <HI>Mary Magdalins,</HI> the <HI>Nunnery,</HI> S <HI>Iohns,</HI> and the <HI>Cruched Fry∣ers,</HI>
all suppressed: within towards the East is mounted an old Castle, and elder ruines vpon a trench
containing two Acres of ground, whereas yet may be seene the prouident care they had against all
ensuing assaults.</P>
<P>The trade of this Towne standeth chiefly in making of Cloth and Baies, with Saies, and other
like Stuffes daily inuented; and is gouerned by two Bailiffes, twelue Aldermen, all wearing Scarlet;
a Recorder, a Towne-Clerke, and foure Sergeants at Mace. Whose position for Latitude is in the

<P><PB REF="52"/>
(8) Places of antiquitie and memorable note in this Countie, I obserue the most famous to be
<HI>Camalodumum,</HI> by vs <HI>Maldon,</HI> which was the Royall Seat of <HI>Cunobel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> King of the <HI>Trino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antes,</HI> as by
his money therein minted appeareth, about the time of our <HI>Sauiours</HI> birth: which Citie afterwards
<HI>Claudius</HI> wonne from the <HI>Britaines,</HI> and therein placed a Colony of Souldiers, which were called
<HI>Victricensis.</HI> This Citie Queene <HI>Boduo,</HI> in reuenge of her wrongs, raced to the ground, what time
she stirred their people against <HI>Nero,</HI> with the slaughter of seuentie thousand of the <HI>Romanes.</HI> Of some
later and lesser account was <HI>Ithanchester,</HI> now S. <HI>Peters</HI> vpon the wall, where the <HI>Forteuses</HI> with their
Captaine kept, towards the declination of the <HI>Romane Empire.</HI> In the East Promontory of this Coun∣tie,
in the Raigne of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, the teeth of a Giant were found (if they were not of an <HI>E∣lephant)</HI>
of a marueilous size (saith <HI>Raph Coggeshall)</HI> and not farre thence, in the raigne of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
more bones to the like wonder were digged vp.</P>
<P>(9) I purposely omit the message of a Pilgrim from S. <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> by whom he sent a Ring to
King <HI>Edward Confessor;</HI> for which cause his house tooke the name <HI>Hauering:</HI> seeing the Monkes of
those times made no great daintie daily to forge matter for their owne aduantage: who in this Shire

of destruction, when the rest of such foundations fell vnder the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ile of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, who
with <HI>Hezekiah</HI> brake downe all these Brazen Serpents.</P>
<P>(10) This Shire is diuided into 20. Hundreds, wherein are seated 21 Market-Townes, 5. Ca∣ttles,

CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>SVFFOLKE, in regard of them which were seated in <HI>Norfolke,</HI> is a Country most plenteous and
pleasant for habitation. It is separated from <HI>Norfolke,</HI> by the Riuers of the lesser <HI>Ouse,</HI> and <HI>Waue∣ney,</HI>
whose heads meet almost in the midst of her Verge, and that very neere together: the one
taking course <HI>East,</HI> and the other full <HI>West,</HI> vpon which part <HI>Cambridge-shire</HI> doth wholly con∣front.
The South side is seuered by <HI>Stoure</HI> from <HI>Essex,</HI> and the East together washed with the

<P>(2) The Ayre is good, sweet, and delectable, and in some parts, of some of our best Physitians,
held to be the best in the Land: the Soile is rich, fruitfull, and with all things well replenished; in a

<P>(4) Anciently this part of the <HI>Iland</HI> was possessed by the <HI>Iceni,</HI> who as it seemeth by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> ioy∣ned
in Amitie with the <HI>Romans, a mightie people</HI> (saith he) <HI>and neuer shaken with warres</HI> before the

<HI>Romans;</HI> and in a Battle against them, <HI>M. Ostorius</HI> the sonne of the <HI>Generall,</HI> wonne great honour in
sauing of a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens life; so ready were they to giue and receiue Honours to themselues, but
sleightly to passe ouer, and to smoother farre greater exployts of the <HI>Britaines:</HI> which notwithstan∣ding
<PB REF="53"/>
long in these parts they could not doe; for the wrongs of the <HI>Icenians</HI> growing intolerable, who
by the <HI>Romane</HI> Souldiers were put out of their rightfull possessions, their Princes accounted no bet∣ter
then Slaues, and their Queene whipped in most ignominious manner; vnder <HI>Boduo</HI> they wrought
their reuenge, as in the History (Christ assisting) shall be further related.</P>
<P>Next to these <HI>Icenians,</HI> were the <HI>Saxons</HI> that got their footing into these parts, and of them, this
with <HI>Norfolke, Cambridge shire,</HI> and the <HI>Ile</HI> of <HI>Ely,</HI> was made their <HI>East-Angles</HI> Kingdome; though
as it seemeth euer in subiection either to the <HI>Mercians,</HI> or to the Kings of <HI>Kent</HI> whose off-spring en∣ding
in S <HI>Edmund</HI> the Martyr, after the <HI>Danes</HI> had laid it most desolate, <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder subdued
it vnto his <HI>West-Saxons</HI> Monarchy: and that likewise ending in King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, many
Noble <HI>Normans</HI> got their possessions in these parts, whose off-spring are plenteously replenished in
this Shire to this day.</P>
<P>(5) The commodities of this Shire are many and great, whereof the chiefest consisteth in Corne,
in Cattle, Cloth, Pasturage, Woods, Sea-fish and Fowle; and as <HI>Abbo Floricensis</HI> hath depainted,

begun by King <HI>Canute,</HI> much affrighted with the seeming appearance of that Martyrs Ghost, who
to expiate the Sacrilegious impietie of his Father <HI>Suenus,</HI> enriched the place with many endowments,

<P>As strange, but most true, was a crop of Pease, that without tillage or sowing grew in the Rockes,

was in the Land: there in <HI>August</HI> were gathered aboue one hundred Quarters, and in blossoming re∣mained

<HEAD>NORTHFOLKE.
CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>NORTHFOLKE is an Iland inclining to an ouall forme, closed on the South part with the
Riuers of <HI>Waueney</HI> and the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sser <HI>Ouse,</HI> which diuides it from <HI>Suffolke.</HI> On the East and
North with the <HI>Germane Ocean;</HI> on the West toward <HI>Cambridge-shire,</HI> with some branches
of the greater <HI>Ouse;</HI> toward <HI>Lincolne-shire</HI> with that part of the <HI>neue</HI> which passeth from <HI>Wis∣bitch</HI>
into the <HI>Washes.</HI></P>
<P>It containeth in length (from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> to <HI>Wisbitch)</HI> about fiftie miles▪ In breadth (from <HI>Thet∣ford</HI>
to <HI>Wels)</HI> about thirtie. The whole Circuit is about two hundred fortie two miles.</P>
<P>The Name ariseth from the situation of the people, who being the Norther-most of the King∣dome
of <HI>East-Angles,</HI> are therefore called the <HI>Northfolke,</HI> as the Souther-most of the <HI>Southfolke▪</HI></P>
<P>The Ayre is sharpe and piercing, especially in the Champion, and neere the Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore it de∣laieth

degree of Latitude.</P>
<P>The So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e diuers: about the Townes commonly good; as Clay; Chalke, or sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earth, well wate∣red,
and with some wood: vpward to the Heaths naked, dry, and barren: <HI>Marsland</HI> and <HI>Flegg</HI> excee∣ding
rich; but <HI>Marsland</HI> properly for Pastere, <HI>Flegg</HI> for Corne.</P>
<P>(2) The parts from <HI>Thetford</HI> to <HI>Buruham,</HI> and thence Westward, as also along the Coast, be
counted <HI>Champion:</HI> the rest (as better furnished with woods) <HI>Woodland.</HI> The <HI>Champion</HI> aboundeth
with Corne, Sheepe, and Conies, and here in the barren Heaths (as the prouidence of our Ancestors
hath of old disposed them) are very profitable. For on them principally lie our <HI>Fould courses,</HI> called
<PB REF="56"/>
of the <HI>Saxons</HI> (whose institution they therefore seeme to be) <HI>Paldyoeun,</HI> that is, <HI>Libertie of fold or foul∣dage.</HI>
These Heaths by the Compasture of the sheepe (which we call <HI>Tath:)</HI> are made so rich with
Corne, that when they fall to be sowne, they commonly match the fruitfullest grounds in other
Countries and laid againe, doe long after yeeld a sweeter and more plentifull feed for sheepe: so
that each of them maintaine other, and are the chiefest wealth of our Country. The <HI>Woodland</HI> (fitter
for grasse) is maintained chiefly by feeding of Cattell, yet well stored with Corne and Sheepe.</P>
<P>The Coast is fortunate in Fish▪ and hath many good Harbours, whereof <HI>Lenn</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth</HI> be the
mother-ports, and of great traffique: <HI>Wels</HI> and <HI>Blakeney</HI> next in estimation.</P>
<P>The whole Countie aboundeth with Riuers and pleasant Springs, of which the <HI>Ouse</HI> is chiefest,
by whose plentifull branches, the Isle of <HI>Fly,</HI> the Townes and Shires of <HI>Cambridge, Humington,</HI> and
the Countie of <HI>Suffolke</HI> vent and receiue Commodities. The next is <HI>Hierus</HI> or <HI>Yere,</HI> passing from
<HI>Norwich</HI> to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> where it receiueth the <HI>Bure</HI> comming from <HI>Aylsham,</HI> both of them of great
seruice for water-carriages, but very notable for their plenty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for some one man out of an hold

busness of Fish at one draught. The <HI>Waueney</HI> and the lesser <HI>Ouse</HI> are also Nauigable and of great
vse. The residue I omit.</P>
<P>(3) I he people were anciently called ICENI, as they also of <HI>Suffolke, Cambridge-shire,</HI> and
<HI>Huntington-shire,</HI> and supposed to be of them whom <HI>Caesar</HI> nameth <HI>Cenimagni; Ptolemie, Simeni;</HI> some
<HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gens.</HI> Their manners were likely to be as the rest of the <HI>Britaines,</HI> barbarous at those times, as ap∣peareth
by <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> Neither can I otherwise commend their Successors the <HI>Saxons:</HI> for so
also their owne Countryman <HI>Ethelwerd</HI> termeth them. Since the entry of the <HI>Normans,</HI> they haue
beene accounted ciuill and ingenious, apt to good Letters, adorning Religion with more Churches
and Monasteries, then any Shire of <HI>England,</HI> and the Lawes and Seats of Iustice (for many ages)
<PB REF="57"/>
with some excellent men; from whom most of our chiefe Families, and some of the greatest Nobi∣lity
of the Kingdome, haue taken aduancement And herein is <HI>Northfolke</HI> fortunate, that as <HI>Crete</HI> boa∣sted
of an hundred Cities, so may she of an hundred Families of Gentlemen, neuer yet attainted of
high Treason. How the gouernment of this Country was about <HI>Caesars</HI> time, is vncertaine, but (a∣greeable
no doubt to the rest of the <HI>Britaines)</HI> vnder some peculiar <HI>Toparch</HI> or <HI>Regulus,</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> ter∣meth
him. The latter <HI>Romans</HI> held it by two <HI>Garrisons,</HI> one at <HI>Gariannum</HI> neere <HI>Yarmouth;</HI> the other
at <HI>Branedunum,</HI> now called <HI>Brancastre,</HI> both of horse, and commanded by the <HI>Comes Maritims Tractus,</HI>
as <HI>Marcellinus</HI> calleth him, termed after <HI>Comes Littoris Saexonici</HI> Vpon the entry of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> this
Countie with <HI>Suffolke</HI> fell in the portion of the <HI>Angles,</HI> and about the yeare fiue hundred sixtie one,
were together erected into a Kingdome by <HI>Vffa,</HI> of whom the succeeding Kings were tituled <HI>Vffines.</HI>
But hauing suffred many Tempests of <HI>Fortune,</HI> it was in the yeare 870. vtterly wasted and extinct by
<HI>Hungar</HI> and <HI>Hubba</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> who ouerthrew the vertuous King <HI>Edmund</HI> about <HI>Thetford,</HI> and after
martyred him at S. <HI>Edmundsbury.</HI> Yet they did not long enioy it: for King <HI>Edward</HI> shortly recoue∣red
it from them, and annexed it to his other Kingdomes. The <HI>Danes</HI> notwithstanding inhabited a∣bundantly
in these parts, so that many of our Townes were founded by them, and a great part of
our people and Gentry are risen out of their bloud.</P>
<P>(4) This Kingdome of <HI>East-Angles</HI> was after allotted to an Earledome of that name by <HI>Willi∣am
the Conquerour,</HI> who made <HI>Radulph</HI> a <HI>Britaine,</HI> marying his kinswoman, Earle thereof; but gaue
the greatest parts of this Countie about <HI>Wimondham, Keninghall, Lenn, Buruham, Fulmerstone,</HI> &amp;c. to
<HI>W. de Albany, Pincernae,</HI> and <HI>W de Warranna Forrestario,</HI> who to strengthen themselues (according to
the vse of that time) with the homage and seruice of many tenants, diuided large portions of the
same amongst their friends and followers; so that most of the Manours and Lands in the parts a∣foresaid,
were in those dayes either mediately or immediately holden of one of them. And as <HI>North∣folke</HI>
<PB REF="57"/>
and <HI>Suffolke</HI> were first vnited in a Kingdome, then in an Earledome, so they continued vnited
in the <HI>Sheriffe-wicke</HI> till about the fifteenth yeare of Queene <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>(5) The Townes here are commonly well built, and populous; three of them being of that
worth and qualitie, as no one Shire of <HI>England</HI> hath the like, <HI>Norwich, Lenn,</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth:</HI> to which
for ancient reputation (as hauing beene a seat of the Kings of <HI>East-Angles)</HI> I may adde <HI>Thetford,</HI>
knowne to <HI>Antonius, Ptolemie,</HI> and elder ages, by the name of <HI>Sitemagus,</HI> when the other three were
yet in their infancie, and of no esteeme: for I accept not the Relations of the Antiquitie and State of

CHAPTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>CAMBRIDGE-SHIRE, lyeth bounded vpon the North with <HI>Lincolneshire</HI> and <HI>Northfolke;</HI>
vpon the East with <HI>Norfolke</HI> and <HI>Suffolke;</HI> vpon the South with <HI>Hartford-shire</HI> and <HI>Essex;</HI> and
vpon the West with <HI>Bedford</HI> and <HI>Huntington shires.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Prouince is not large, nor for ayre greatly to be liked, hauing the Fennes so
spread vpon her North, that they infect the ayre far into the rest: From whose furthest point
vnto <HI>Royston</HI> in the South, are thirtie-fiue miles; but in the broadest is not fully twentie: the whole
in Circumference, traced by the compasse of her many indents, one hundred twentie and eight
miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Soile doth differ both in ayre and commodities; the Fenny surcharged with waters:
the South is Champion, and yeeldeth <HI>Corne</HI> in abundance, with <HI>Meadowing. Pastures</HI> vpon both the
sides of the Riuer <HI>Came,</HI> which diuides that part of the Shire in the midst, vpon whose <HI>East-bancks</HI>
the <HI>Muses</HI> haue built their most sacred <HI>Seat,</HI> where with plenteous increase they haue continued for
these many hundred yeares.</P>
<P>(4) For from ancient <HI>Grantcester, Camboritum</HI> by <HI>Antonine,</HI> now famous <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the other
brest and <HI>Nurse-mother</HI> of all pious literature, haue flowed full steames of the learned <HI>Sciences</HI> into
all other parts of this Land, and else-where: ancient indeed, if their <HI>Story</HI> be rightly writ, that will
haue it built by <HI>Cantaber</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> three hundred seauenty fiue yeares before the birth of our <HI>Saui∣our,</HI>
who thither first brought and planted the <HI>Muses.</HI> This Citie <HI>Grantcester</HI> by the tyranny of time
lost both her owne beautie and her professed <HI>Athenian Students,</HI> so that in <HI>Bedaes</HI> dayes, seauen hun∣dred
yeares after the Word became flesh, it is described to lye a little desolate Citie, and as yet re∣taineth
the name, without any memory of circuit by wals.</P>
<P><PB REF="60"/>
Of this Citie, in the yeare of <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> 141. as the Monke of <HI>Barton</HI> doth report, nine Scholars
receiued their <HI>Baptisme,</HI> and became Preachers of the Gospell among the <HI>Britaines;</HI> which (as he
saith)
happened in the Raigne of <HI>Hadriant</HI> the Emperour. But when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Stors, His<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes</HI> and <HI>Sax∣ons</HI>
had laid all things waste, and with their sauage swords cut out the leaues of all ciuill learning,
this as the rest yeelded to destruction, and so lay forlorne till the <HI>Saxons</HI> themselues became likewise
ciuill; when <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gebert</HI> the first <HI>Christian King</HI> of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> from the example of <HI>France,</HI> whither
he had beene banished, built <HI>Schooies</HI> in his Kingdome, and here at <HI>Grancester</HI> the chiefe, recalling
thither the Professors of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> as the Story recordeth, and Traditions doe hold.</P>
<P>But afterwards, as it seemeth, their increase being straightned, the <HI>Students</HI> complained (as the
Prophets did to <HI>Elisha)</HI> that the place was too little for them to dwell in, therefore inlarging more
North-ward, seated themselues neere vnto the <HI>Bridge,</HI> whereupon the place began to be called <HI>Grant∣bridge,</HI>
though others from the crooked Riuer <HI>Came</HI> will haue it named <HI>Cambridge.</HI> This place
(though sacred and exempted from <HI>Mars,</HI> as <HI>Sylla</HI> once spake; when he spared <HI>Athens,)</HI> the <HI>Danes</HI>
in their destructions regarded no whit, wherein they often wintered after their spoyles, and left the
scatres of their sauage sores euer behinde them. And in the yeare 1010 when <HI>Suen</HI> in his fiercenesse
bare downe all before him, this place was no place for <HI>Scholars</HI> to be in: <HI>Warres</HI> loud <HI>Alarums</HI> ill
consorting the <HI>Muses</HI> milde Harmonies. Yet when the <HI>Normans</HI> had got the <HI>Garland</HI> on their heads,
and these <HI>Danish stormes</HI> turned into <HI>Sun-shine dayes, Gislebert</HI> the <HI>Monke,</HI> with <HI>Odo, Terricus,</HI> and <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI>
all three of the like <HI>Monasticall Profession,</HI> in the Raigne of King <HI>Henry</HI> the First, resorted vnto
this place, and in a publike <HI>Barne</HI> read the <HI>Lectures</HI> of <HI>Grammar, Logicke,</HI> and <HI>Rhetoricke,</HI> and <HI>Gislebert
Diuinitie</HI> vpon the Sabbath and Festiuall dayes. <HI>From this little fountaine</HI> (saith <HI>Peter Blessensis) grew
a great Riuer, which made all</HI> England <HI>fruitfull, by the many Masters &amp; Teachers proceeding out of</HI> Cam∣bridge,
<HI>as out of a holy Paradise of God.</HI> The first <HI>Colledge</HI> therein endowed with Possessions was <HI>Peter∣house,</HI>
<PB REF="61"/>
built by <HI>Hugh Balsham</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> in the yeare of Grace, 1284. whose godly example many
others followed, so that at this day there are sixteene most stately <HI>Colledges</HI> and <HI>Hals,</HI> for building,
beautie, endowments, and store of <HI>Students</HI> so replenished, that vnlesse it be in her other Sister <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI>
the like are not found in all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But at what time it was made an <HI>Vniuersitie,</HI> let <HI>Robert de Remyngton</HI> tell you for me. <HI>Do the Raigne</HI>
(saith he) <HI>of King</HI> Edward <HI>the first, Grantbridge, of a Schoole, by the Court of Rome, was made an Vni∣uersitie,
such as Oxford is.</HI> Lastly, the <HI>Meridian Line</HI> cutting the <HI>Zenith</HI> ouer this Citie, is distant from
the furthest West-poynt, according to <HI>Mercator,</HI> 20 degrees, 50 scruples, and the <HI>Arch</HI> of the same
<HI>Meridian,</HI> lying betweene the <HI>Aequator</HI> and <HI>Verticall point,</HI> is 52. degrees, 20 scruples.</P>
<P>(5) Another Citie formerly in great fame is <HI>Elie,</HI> had in account for the repute and holinesse of
<HI>Votary Nunnes</HI> there residing; built first by <HI>Audrey</HI> wife to one <HI>Tombret</HI> a <HI>Prince</HI> in this <HI>Prouince,</HI>
who had this place as a part of her Dowry: she hauing departed from her second Husband <HI>Egbert</HI>
King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> deuoted her selfe to the seruice of God, and built here a <HI>Monastery,</HI> where∣of
she became the first <HI>Abbesse.</HI> This in the <HI>Danish</HI> desolations was destroyed, but soone after reedi∣fied
by <HI>Ethelwold</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> who stored it with <HI>Monkes;</HI> vnto whom King <HI>Edgar</HI> granted
the iurisdiction ouer foure Hundreds and a halfe, within these Fennes and the <HI>East-Angles</HI> limits,
which to this day are called <HI>The Liberties of S. Audrey,</HI> after whose example many <HI>Nobles</HI> so enriched
it with large <HI>Renexewes,</HI> that as <HI>Malmesbury</HI> saith, <HI>the Abbat thereof laid vp yeerely in his owne Coffers
a thousand and foure hundred pounds</HI> And of latter times the <HI>Monkes</HI> thereof became so wealthy, that
their old decayed Church they renued with new and most stately buildings, which is now the <HI>Ca∣thedrall</HI>
of the <HI>Diocesse,</HI> and for beautie giueth place to no other in the Land Eight other foundations
set apart from secular vse in this <HI>Prouince,</HI> were at <HI>Thorney, Charteres, Denny, Elsey, Beach, Barnwell,
Swasey,</HI> and <HI>Shengey,</HI> all which in the dayes of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight came to the period of their sur∣passing
wealth, and left their Lands to the dispose of his Will.</P>
<P><PB REF="61"/>
(6) The generall commoditie of this Shire is <HI>Corne,</HI> which in the South, and Champion-part
doth abundantly grow, as also <HI>Saffron,</HI> a very rich Spice. Some <HI>Woods</HI> there are, and <HI>Pasture</HI> both
pleasant and profitable. The North part thereof is Fenny, but withall fruitfull, whereof <HI>Henry</HI> of
<HI>Huntington</HI> and <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malinesbury</HI> thus doe write: <HI>This Fenny Country is passing rich and plente∣ous,
yea, and beautifull also to behold, whereiwis so great store of fish, that strangers doe wonder, and water-fowle
so cheape, that fiue men may therewith be satisfied with lesse then an halfe-penny.</HI></P>
<P>(7) Places of ancient note in this Shire are these, the <HI>Erminstreet way,</HI> which vpon the lower
West parts of this County, thorow <HI>Roisen,</HI> runneth forthright vnto <HI>Huntingdon.</HI> And from <HI>Reach</HI> a

which for the wonder receiued thereat, is of the vulgar called <HI>The Deu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ditch,</HI> being
in truth made for a defence against the <HI>Mercians</HI> by the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> whose Kingdome it inuerged.

<P>(4) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> that held in this Shire, were part of the

three miles together on foot in the very depth of her Channell; and backward, the waters swelled
vnto a great height: which was obserued by the judicious, to foretell some vnkinde diuision that
shortly should arise.</P>
<P>(6) This Countie, among the common calamities of the Land, when it lay trampied vnder the

themselues with the first to <HI>Caesar</HI> vnder the <HI>Romanes</HI> subiection, whose ouer-worne Empire ending
in <HI>Britaine,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> by strong hand attained this Prouince, and made it a part of their <HI>Mercian
Kingdome:</HI> yet was it first subdued vnto them by <HI>Cherdike</HI> the <HI>West-Saxon,</HI> whose memory is in part
continued in the Towne <HI>Chersey,</HI> vpon the West of this Countie, where in a sharpe and bloudy bat∣tle

that weight of greatnesse they had so grasped, gaue place to their conquerours, who did many harmes
in this Prouince: for in the yeare 914. the <HI>Danes</HI> furiously raged as farre as <HI>Brenwood,</HI> where they
destroyed the City <HI>Burgh,</HI> the ancient seat of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> afterwards a royall house of King <HI>Edward</HI>
the <HI>Confessor,</HI> which they vtterly destroyed.</P>
<P>(5) The Shire-Towne <HI>Buckingham,</HI> fruitfully seated vpon the Riuer <HI>Ouse,</HI> was fortified with a
Rampire, and Sconses on both bankes, by King <HI>Edward</HI> the elder, saith <HI>Marianus</HI> the Scotish Wri∣ter;
where in the heart of the Towne hath stood a strong Castle, mounted vpon a high hill, which
long since was brought to the period of her estate, now nothing remaining besides the signes, that
there she had stood. The Riuer circulates this Towne on euery side, that onely on the North ex∣cepted,
ouer which three faire stone-bridges lead, and into which the springs of a Well run, called
S. <HI>Rumalds,</HI> a child-saint borne at <HI>Kings-Sutton,</HI> canonized, and in the Church of this Towne en∣shrined,

in memory of <HI>Eleanor</HI> his dead Queene, as he did in euery place where her Corps rested, from <HI>Herd∣by</HI>
in <HI>Lincolne-shire,</HI> till it was receiued and buried at <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>

vnto all good gifts (a speciall glory) is the Riuer <HI>Seuerne,</HI> then which there is not any in all the Land, for
<PB REF="72"/>
Channell broader, for Streame swifter, or for Fish better stored. There is in it a daily rage and fury of wa∣ters,
which I know not whether I may call a Gulfe or Whirle-pole of waues, raising vp the sands from the
bottome, winding and driuing them vpon heapes: sometimes ouerflowing her bankes, ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth a great way
vpon the face of her bordering grounds, and againe retyreth as a Conquerour into the vsuall Channell. Vn∣happy
is the Vessell which it taketh full vpon the side: but the Water-men well ware thereof, when they see
that Hydra comming, turne the Vessell vpon it, and cut thorow the midst of it, whereby they checke and a∣uoyd
her violence and danger.</P>
<P>(4) The ancient people that possessed this Prouince, were the DOBVNI, who spread them∣selues
further into <HI>Oxford shire.</HI> But betwixt the <HI>Seuerne</HI> and <HI>Wye</HI> were seated part of SILVRES,
or Inhabitants of <HI>South Wales.</HI> And vpon what ground I know not, let <HI>Lawyers</HI> dispute it, the In∣habitants
in some part of this Shire enioy a priuate custome to this day, that the Goods and Lands
of <HI>Condemned Persons</HI> fall vnto the Crowne but onely for a yeare and a day, and then returne to the
next heires, contrary to the custome of all <HI>England</HI> besides▪</P>
<P>(5) The general Commodities of this Shire, are <HI>Corne, Iron,</HI> and <HI>Wools,</HI> all passing fine, besides
<HI>Pasturage, Fruits,</HI> and <HI>Woods,</HI> which last are much lessened by making of <HI>Iron,</HI> the onely bane of <HI>Oke,
Elme,</HI> and <HI>Beech.</HI></P>
<P>(6) These, with all other prouisions are traded thorow twenty fiue <HI>Market-Townes</HI> in this Coun∣ty,
whereof two are Cities of no small import: the first is <HI>Glocester,</HI> from whom the Shire taketh
name, seated vpon <HI>Seuerne,</HI> neere the middest of this Shire, by <HI>Antonine</HI> the Emperour called <HI>Gleu∣um,</HI>
built first by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and set as it were vpon the necke of the <HI>Silures,</HI> to yoake them, where
their Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion called <HI>Colonia Gleuum,</HI> lay. It hath beene walled about (excepting that part that is
defended by the Riuer) the ruines whereof in many places appeare; and some part yet standing,
doth well witnesse their strength. This City was first won from the <HI>Britaines</HI> by <HI>Cheulin</HI> the first King
<PB REF="73"/>
of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> about the yeare of Christ, 570. and afterwards vnder the <HI>Mercians</HI> it flourished
with great honour, where <HI>Of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> by the sufferance of <HI>Ethelred</HI> of <HI>Mercia,</HI>
founded a most stately <HI>Monastery</HI> of <HI>Nunnes,</HI> whereof <HI>Kineburgh, Eadburgh,</HI> and <HI>Eue,</HI> Queenes of
the <HI>Mercians,</HI> were <HI>Prioresses</HI> successiuely each after other.</P>
<P>(7) <HI>Edelsted</HI> a most renowned Lady, sister to King <HI>Edward</HI> the elder, in this Citie built a faire
Church, wherein her selfe was interred; which being ouerthrowne by the <HI>Danes,</HI> was afterwards re∣built,
and made the Cathedrall of that See, dedicated vnto the honour of S. <HI>Peter.</HI> In this Church
the vnfortunate Prince, King <HI>Edward</HI> the second, vnder a Monument of <HI>Alablaster</HI> doth lye; who be∣ing
murdered at <HI>Barkley Castle,</HI> by the crueltie of <HI>French Isabel</HI> his wife, was there intombed And not

the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> lyeth in a painted woodden <HI>Tombe</HI> in the middest of the <HI>Quire;</HI> whose eyes were
pluckt out in <HI>Cardiffe Castle,</HI> wherein he was kept prisoner twenty six yeares, with all contumelious
indignities, vntill through extreame anguish he ended his life. And before any of these, in this Citie
say our <HI>British Historians,</HI> the body of <HI>Lucius</HI> our first Christian King was interred: and before his
dayes the <HI>Britaines Aruiragus.</HI></P>
<P>The graduation of this County I obserue from this Citie, whence the Pole is eleuated in the de∣gree
of Latitude 52 and 14. minutes, and in Longitude from the West, 18. and 5. minutes.</P>
<P>(8) The other Citie is <HI>Pristow,</HI> fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, but not very ancient, built vpon the Riuers <HI>Auon</HI> and
<HI>Froome,</HI> for trade of Merchandize a second <HI>London,</HI> and for beautie and account next vnto <HI>Yorke.</HI>
This Citie standeth partly in this Countie, and partly in <HI>Sommerset shire:</HI> but being a Countie of it

wherein the Consular Port or wayes of the <HI>Romans</HI> met and crossed each other. This Citie was
wonne from the <HI>Britaines</HI> by <HI>Cheulin</HI> first King of the <HI>West-Saxons:</HI> afterwards it was possessed by
the <HI>Mercians;</HI> and lastly, by the <HI>Danes</HI> vnder <HI>Gurmund</HI> (the former no doubt mistaken for him) where∣in
a rable of them kept the space of a yeare, <HI>Anno</HI> 879. and neuer since inhabited, according to the
circuit of her walles.</P>
<P>(10) Places of memorable note are these: the <HI>Iland Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey</HI> neere vnto <HI>Glocester,</HI> wherein <HI>Edmund
Iron-side</HI> the <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Canutus</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> after many battles and bloud, fought in single Combat
hand to hand alone, vntill they compounded for the Kingdomes partition: <HI>Barkley Castle,</HI> where
King <HI>Edward</HI> the second was thorow his fundament runne into his bowels with a red burning Spit:
<HI>Tewkesbury</HI> the fatall period of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt his gouernment, and the wound of the <HI>Lanca∣strian</HI>

<HI>Henry,</HI> had his braines dashed out in a most shamefull manner, the Queene his mother taken priso∣ner,
and most of their fauorites slaine and beheaded. And at <HI>Alderley,</HI> a little Towne standing eight
miles from the <HI>Seuerne,</HI> vpon the hilles to this day are found <HI>Cockles, Periwincles,</HI> and <HI>Oysters</HI> of solid
stone, which whether they haue beene Shel-fish and liuing creatures, or else the sports of <HI>Nature</HI> in
her workes, let the <HI>Naturall Philosophers</HI> dispute of and judge.</P>
<P>(11) The places of pietie, set apart from other worldly Seruices, and dedicated to religious v∣ses
by the deuotions of Princes, erected in this Shire, were <HI>Tewkesbury, Deorhust, Glocester, Minching,
Barkley, Kinswood, Circester, Winchcombe,</HI> and <HI>Hales;</HI> which last was built with great cost by <HI>Richard</HI>
Earle of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> wherein himselfe, and his <HI>Dutchesse</HI> were interred. Their son
Earle <HI>Edmund</HI> brought out of <HI>Germany</HI> the bloud of <HI>Hales,</HI> supposed and said to be part of that which
<PB REF="74"/>
Christ shed vpon his Crosse. In this place with great confluence and deuotions of Pilgrimage it
was sought to and worshipped, till time proued it a meere counterfeit, when the glorious light of the

<P>HEREFORD-SHIRE, (formerly accounted within the limits of <HI>Wales)</HI> lyeth circulated

part with the <HI>Hatterall Hilles</HI> is diuided from <HI>Brecknok;</HI> and the rest confined with <HI>Radnor∣shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Counties Climate is most healthfull and temperate, and Soyle so fertile for Corne
and Cattle, that no place in <HI>England</HI> yeeldeth more or better conditioned: sweet Riuers running as
veynes in the body, doe make the Corne bearing grounds in some of her parts rightly to be tear∣med
the <HI>Gilden Vale:</HI> and for Waters, Wooll, and Wheate, doth contend with <HI>Nilus, Colchos,</HI> and <HI>E∣gypt:</HI>
such are <HI>Lemster, Irchenfeild,</HI> the bankes of <HI>Wye, Luge,</HI> and <HI>Frome.</HI></P>
<P>(3) The ancient people knowne to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> (whose power they well felt before they could
subdue them) were the <HI>Silures,</HI> placed by <HI>Ptolemie</HI> in this tract, and branched further into <HI>Radnor,
Brecknok, Monmouth,</HI> and <HI>Glamorgan-shires,</HI> at this day by vs called <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and by the <HI>Welsh De∣beubarth.</HI>
Their Originall, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> coniectureth by their site, coloured countenances and curled
haire, was out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and as both he and <HI>Plinie</HI> describes them, were fierce, valiant, and impatient
of seruitude, which well they shewed vnder <HI>Cara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cus</HI> their Captaine, and nine yeares scourge to
the <HI>Roman</HI> assaulters, for whose onely Conquest (and that made by treachery) the Victor in <HI>Rome</HI>
triumphed with more then a vsuall Aspect; and with so equall an hand bare the Scoale of Resistance,
that their owne Writers euermore terme it a dangerous Warre. For the Legion of <HI>Marius Valens</HI>
<PB REF="75"/>
they put to flight, and that with such hauock of the Associates, that <HI>Osterius</HI> the Lieutenant of <HI>Bri∣taine</HI>
for very griefe gaue vp his ghost: and <HI>Veranius</HI> vnder <HI>Nero</HI> assaulted them in vaine. But when
<HI>Vespasian</HI> was <HI>Emperour,</HI> and expert Souldiers imployed in euery Prouince, <HI>Iulius Frontinus</HI> subdued
these <HI>Silures</HI> vnto the <HI>Romans,</HI> where continually some of their Legions afterward kept, till all was
abandoned in <HI>Valentinians</HI> time.</P>
<P>(4) The <HI>Saxons</HI> then made themselues Lords of this Land, and this Prouince a part of their
<HI>Mercians</HI> Kingdome; yea, and <HI>Sutton</HI> the Court of great <HI>Offa</HI> their King.</P>
<P>(5) But <HI>Hereford</HI> after, raised of the ruines of old <HI>Ariconium</HI> (now <HI>Kenchester,</HI> shaken in pieces
by a violent Earth quake) grew to great fame, through a conceiued sanctity by the buriall of <HI>Ethel∣bert</HI>
King of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> slaine at <HI>Sutton</HI> by <HI>Offa,</HI> at what time he came thither to haue espoused to
his Daughter; whose graue was first made at <HI>Marden,</HI> but afterwards canonized and remoued to
this Citie, when in honour of him was built the Cathedrall Church by <HI>Milfrid,</HI> a pettie King of
that Country, which <HI>Gruffith</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Algar</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> rebelling against
King <HI>Edward Confessor,</HI> consumed with fire; but by Bishop <HI>Remesiu</HI> was restored at now it is, at what
time the Towne was walled, and is so remaining in good repaire, hauing sixe Gates for entrance,
and fifteen Watch-towers for defence, extending in compasse to fifteen hundred paces: and whence
the <HI>North-Pole</HI> is obserued to be raised 52. degrees, 17. minutes in Latitude, and is set from the first
point of the <HI>West</HI> in Longitude, 17. degrees and 30. minutes; being yearely gouerned by a Maior,
chosen out of one and thirtie Citizens, which are commonly called the Election, and he euer after
is knowne for an Alderman, and clothed in Scarlet, whereof foure of the eldest are Iustices of Peace,
graced with a Sword-bearer, a Recorder, a Towne-Clerke, and foure Sergeants with Mace.</P>
<P>The greatest glory that this Citie receiued, was in King <HI>Athelstans</HI> dayes; where (as <HI>Malmesbury</HI>
doth report) he caused the Lords of <HI>Wales</HI> by way of Tribute, to pay yearely (besides Hawkes and
<PB REF="76"/>
Hounds) twenty pound of Gold, and three hundred pound of Siluer by waight; but how that was
performed and continued I finde not.</P>
<P>(6) Things of rare note in this Shire are said to be, <HI>Bone well,</HI> a Spring not farre from <HI>Richards
Castle,</HI> wherein are continually found little Fishes bones, but not a sinne seene; and being wholly
cleansed thereof, will notwithstanding haue againe the like, whether naturally produced, or in veynes
thither brought, no man knoweth.</P>
<P>(7) But more admirable was the worke of the Omnipotent, euen in our owne remembrances,
and yeare of Christ Iesus 1571. when the <HI>Mareley hill</HI> in the East of this Shire, rouzed it selfe out
of a dead sleepe, with a roaring noise remoued from the placewhere it stood, and for three dayes to∣gether
trauelled from her first site, to the great amazement and feare of the beholders. It began to
journey vpon the seuenth day of <HI>February,</HI> being <HI>Saturday,</HI> at sixe of the Clocke at night, and by
seauen in the next morning had gone fortie paces, carrying with it Sheepe in their coates, hedge∣rowes,
and trees; whereof some were ouer-turned, and some that stood vpon the plaine, are firmely
growing vpon the hill, those that were East, were turned West; and those in the West <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> set in the
East: in which remoue it ouerthrew <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nasten Chappell,</HI> and turned two high-wayes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hundred

A∣cres,
which opening it selfe with Rockes and all, bare the earth before it for foure hundred yards
space without any stay, leauing that which was Pasturage in place of the Tillage, and the Tillage
ouerspread with Pasturage. Lastly, ouerwhelming her lower parts, mounted to an hill of twelue fa∣domes
high, and there rested her selfe after three dayes trauell: remaining his marke, that so laid
hand vpon this Rocke, whose power hath poysed the Hils in his Ballance.</P>
<P>(8) Religious Houses built by the deuotions of Princes, and stored with <HI>Votaries</HI> and reuenewes
for life, were in this Shire no lesse then thirteene, most sweetly seated in the places as followeth: at
<PB REF="76"/>
both the <HI>Herefords, Barron, Ewayot, Clifford, Mone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, Acornebury, Lemster, Linbroke, Peterchurch,
Kilpek, Dore,</HI> and <HI>Wiggemore:</HI> and suspected of hypocrisie, were called in question by King <HI>Henry</HI> the
eight, and so strictly pursued, that some faults were apparant, whereby they were laid open to the
generall Deluge of the Time, whose streame bare downe the walles of all those foundations, car∣rying
away the Shrines of the dead, and defacing the Libraries of their ancient Records.</P>
<P>(9) This Countie before the Conquest being accounted in <HI>Wales,</HI> was then strengthened with
Forts against the <HI>English:</HI> and being once made a Prounce to <HI>England,</HI> was fortified with Castles
against the <HI>Welsh,</HI> wherein we finde no lesse then twentie eight, though many of them now are rui∣nated

<HEAD>VVORCESTER-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXV.</HEAD>
<P>VVORCESTER-SHIRE, is a Countie both rich and populour, and lyeth circu∣lated
vpon the <HI>North</HI> with <HI>Stafford</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vpon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>East</HI> with <HI>Warwicke</HI> and <HI>Oxford∣shires;</HI>
vpon the <HI>South</HI> with <HI>Glacester</HI> shire, and the <HI>West</HI> by <HI>Maluerne Hils</HI> is parted
from <HI>Hereford shire:</HI> the rest lyeth confronted vpon and in part diuided from
<HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op-shire</HI> by the Riuer <HI>Dowles.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is triangle, but not of equall proportion; for from North to South are
thirtie two miles, from South to North-West twenty two, and from thence to her North-East point
are twenty eight: the whole in Circumference is one hundred and twentie miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Ayre in this Shire is of a fauourable temperature, that giues an appetite for labour, diet,
and rest: the Soyle is fertile, and to me seemed inferiour to notice other in this Land: for besides the
abundance of Corne in euery place spread, the Woods and Pasturage in her hils and plaines, sweet
Riuers that water the vallies below, and Cattle that couer the tops of higher ground; the Fields,
Hedge-rowes, and High-wayes are beset with fruitfull Peare-trees, that yeeld great pleasure to sight,
and commodious vse: for with their iuyce they make a bastard kinde of Wine, called <HI>Perry,</HI> which
is both pleasant and good in taste. Many <HI>Salt Springs</HI> also this County affordeth; yea, and more
then are commonly in vse: such with the <HI>Germans,</HI> our ancient Predecessors, were esteemed most
sacred and holy; so that (as <HI>Tacitus</HI> writeth) to such they wontedly resoted to supplicate their <HI>Gods</HI>
with their deuout prayers, as to places neerest the heauens, and therefore the sooner to be heard.
And <HI>Poets</HI> in their faynings will haue the <HI>Nymphs</HI> residence in shady greene groues, and bankes of
<PB REF="78"/>
sweet Springs: if so, then (as <HI>Hellicon)</HI> this County affords both: such are the Forrests of <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> and
<HI>Feckenham,</HI> the great woods of <HI>Norton,</HI> and most faire Chase of <HI>Maluerne.</HI> And for waters, to witnesse
what I say, is the <HI>Seuera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that cuts this Shire in the midst, <HI>Teme, Salwarp,</HI> and <HI>Auon,</HI> all of them ma∣king
fruitfull their passage, and stored with Fish of most delicious taste.</P>
<P>(4) The ancient people, possessors of this Shire, were the CORNAVII, inhabitants of <HI>Chesse-shire,
Shrop-shire, Stafford,</HI> and <HI>Warwicke-shires,</HI> subdued by the <HI>Romanes</HI> in <HI>Claudius Caesars</HI> time, and
after their departure, made a portion of the <HI>Mercian-Saxons</HI> Kingdome, and in <HI>Bedaes</HI> time were cal∣led
the <HI>Wicij,</HI> whereof it may be this Shire had the name: vnlesse you will haue it from the <HI>Salt-Pits,</HI>
which in old <HI>English</HI> are named <HI>Wiches;</HI> or from the famous Forrest of <HI>Wyre.</HI> Howsoeuer, true it is
that the County doth hold the name from her chiefe Citie <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>(5) Which is most pleasantly seated, passing well frequented, and very richly inhabited. This
was the <HI>Branouium,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Antouine</HI> and <HI>Ptolemie,</HI> called by the <HI>Britaines, Caer-Wrangon;</HI> by
<HI>Ninius, Caer-Cuorcon;</HI> and by the <HI>Latines, Vigornia.</HI> This Citie is seated vpon the East banke of <HI>Se∣uerne,</HI>
and from the same is walled in triangle-wise about, extending in circuit one thousand sixe
hundred and fiftie paces: thorow which seauen Gates enter, with fiue other Watch Towers for
defence. It is thought the <HI>Romanes</HI> built this to restraine the <HI>Bertaines</HI> that held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beyond <HI>Seutr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI>
This Citie by <HI>Hardy Canute</HI> in the yeare of Christ 1041. was sorely endangered, and set on fire, and
the Citizens slaine almost euery one, for that they had killed his Collector of the <HI>Danish Tribute:</HI>
yet it was presently repaired and peopled, <HI>with many Burgesses. and for fifteene Hides discharged it selfe
to the Conquerour;</HI> as in his <HI>Doomesdayes</HI> is to be seene. But in the yeare 1113. a sodaine fire happe∣ned,
no man knew how, which burnt the Castle and Cathedrall Church. Likewise in the ciuill
hroyles of King <HI>Stephen</HI> it was twice lighted into a flame, and the later laid it hopelesse of recouery.
Notwithstanding from those dead Ashes a new <HI>Phenix</HI> arose, and her building raised in a more
<PB REF="78"/>
stately proportion, especially the Cathedrall dedicated to S. <HI>Mary,</HI> first laid by Bishop <HI>Sexwolfe,</HI>
in <HI>Anno</HI> 680 since when it hath beene augmented almost to the Riuer: In the midst of whose Quire,
from his many turmoiles, resteth the body of King <HI>Iohn</HI> (the great with-stander of the <HI>Popes</HI> procee∣dings)
vnder a Monument of white Marble, in Princely Vestures, with his portraiture thereon ac∣cording
to life. And in the South-side of the same Quire lyeth intombed Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> the eldest
Sonne to King <HI>Henry</HI> the seauenth, his Monument is all blacke Iette, without remembrance of him
by Picture.</P>
<P>This City is gouerned by two Bailiffes, two Aldermen, two Chamberlaines, and two Constables,
yearely elected out of twentie-foure Burgesses clothed in Scarlet, assisted with fortie-eight other
<HI>Citizens,</HI> whom they call their <HI>Common Counsellors,</HI> clad in Purple, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and
fiue Sergeants with Mace their Attendants Whose Geographichall Position is distant in Longitude
from the West-Meridian 18. degrees, 10. scruples, hauing the North-Pole cleuated in Latitude
52. degrees, and 32. scruples.</P>
<P>(6) Places of further note for memorable antiquitie, is <HI>Vpton,</HI> of great account in the <HI>Romane</HI>
time, wheresome of their Legions kept, as witnesse their Monies there often found: the admirable
Ditch vpon <HI>Maluerne hils,</HI> drawne by <HI>Gilbert Clare,</HI> Earle of <HI>Glocester,</HI> to diuide his Lands from the
Church of <HI>Worcester:</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> our <HI>Augustines Oke,</HI> where he the <HI>English</HI> Apostle met with the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Bishops for the vniforme celebration of <HI>Easter,</HI> from whence both parts departed with discon∣tented
minds, after many hot word and thwarting disputes.</P>

<HEAD>VVARWICKE-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>VVARVVICKE-SHIRE, (so called from her Shire-Towne) is bounded vpon the
<HI>North</HI> with the Countie of <HI>Stafford;</HI> vpon the <HI>East,</HI> with <HI>Watling-street-way</HI> is par∣ted
from <HI>Leicester shire,</HI> and the rest bordered vpon by <HI>Northampton shire:</HI> the <HI>South</HI>
part is butted by <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Glocester shires;</HI> and all her <HI>West</HI> with the Countie of
<HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is not much vnlike to a <HI>Scallop shell,</HI> growing from her Westerne head,
and spreading her body wider, with many indents. The length thereof from <HI>Newton</HI> in the North,
to <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ug Compton</HI> in the South, are miles thirtie and three: and the broadest part of this Shire, is from
<HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>well grange</HI> in the West, vnto <HI>Hill morton</HI> in the East, distant asunder twentie fiue miles; the whole
in Circumference, about one hundred thirtie and fiue miles.</P>
<P>(3) This Shire is sited neere vnto the heart of all <HI>England,</HI> and therefore participates with her
in the best both for ayre and soyle, wanting nothing for profit or pleasure for man. The <HI>South</HI> part
from <HI>Auon</HI> (that runneth thorow the midst of this Countie) is called the <HI>Feldon,</HI> as more champion
and tractable to be stirred for Corne, which yearely yeeldeth such plentifull haruest, that the hus∣bandman
sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th in beholding his paines, and the medowing pastures with their greene mantles so
imbrodred with flowers, that from <HI>Edg-hill</HI> we may behold another <HI>Eden,</HI> as <HI>Lot</HI> did the <HI>Plaine</HI> of
<HI>Iordon,</HI> before that <HI>Sodome</HI> fell. The <HI>Woodland</HI> lyeth vpon the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Auon,</HI> so called in regard of
the plentie of <HI>Woods;</HI> which now are much thinner by the making of <HI>Iron,</HI> and the soile more chur∣lish
to yeeld to the <HI>Plough.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="80"/>
(4) The ancient people that possessed this <HI>Prouince,</HI> are by <HI>Ptolemies</HI> description called the <HI>Cor∣na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ij,</HI>
wherein after were seated the <HI>Mercian-Saxons,</HI> a part of whose <HI>Kingdome</HI> it was, and greatly
sought after by the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> whose King <HI>Cuthred,</HI> about the yeare of Christ Iesus 749 in Battle
slew <HI>Ethelbald</HI> at <HI>Seckington</HI> neere vnto <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>worth.</HI> And not farre from thence, King <HI>Edward</HI> the 4.
as vnfortunately sought against that stout make-King, <HI>Richard Neuil</HI> Earle of <HI>Warwicke:</HI> neere vnto
which, vpon <HI>Blacklow-hill, Pierce Gaueston</HI> (that proud and new-raised Earle of <HI>Cornwall)</HI> was be∣headed
by <HI>Guy</HI> Earle of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> assisted with the Earles of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Hereford.</HI> And surely, by
the testimony of <HI>Iohn Rosse,</HI> and others, this County hath beene better replenished with people; who
maketh complaint of whole Towneships depopulations, altogether laid waste by a puissant Armie
of feeding sheepe.</P>
<P>(5) Notwithstanding, many faire Townes it hath, and some of them matchable to the most of
<HI>England.</HI> The chiefe thereof is <HI>Couentree,</HI> a Citie both stately for building, and walled for defence:
whose Citizens hauing highly offended their first Lord <HI>Leofricke,</HI> had their priuiledges infringed,
and themselues oppressed with many hauie Tributes; whose wife Lady <HI>Godina</HI> pitying their estates,
vnceslantly sued for their peace, and that with such importunacie, as hardly could be said whether
was greater, his hatred, or her loue: at last ouercome with her continuall intercessions, he granted
her suir, vpon an vnciuill, and (as he thought) an vnacceptable condition which was, that she should
ride naked thorow the face of the Citie, and that openly at high noone-day. This notwithstanding
she thankfully accepted, and performed the act accordingly enioyned: for this Lady <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> strip∣ping
her selfe of all rich attire, let loose the treffes of her faire haire, which on euery side so couered
her nakednesse, that no part of her body was vnciuill to sight; whereby she redeemed the former free∣domes,
and remission of such heauie <HI>Tributes.</HI> Whose memory I wish may remaine honourable in
that <HI>Citie</HI> for euer, and her pitie followed by such possessing <HI>Ladies.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="81"/>
This <HI>Citie</HI> had grant to choose their yearely <HI>Magistrates,</HI> a <HI>Maior</HI> and two <HI>Bailiffes,</HI> and to build
about and embattle a wall, by King <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. whom <HI>Henry</HI> the 6. corporated a <HI>Countie</HI> of it selfe,
and changed the names of their <HI>Bailifs</HI> into <HI>Sherifs:</HI> and the wals then were built as they now stand;
thorow which open 13 <HI>gates</HI> for entrance, besides 18. other <HI>Towers</HI> thereon for defence. At <HI>Gofford-gate</HI>
in the <HI>East</HI> hangeth the <HI>shield-bene</HI> of a <HI>wild Bore,</HI> farre bigger then the greatest <HI>Oxe-bone:</HI> with
whose snout the great pit called <HI>Swanswell</HI> was turned vp, and was slaine by the famous <HI>Guy,</HI> if we
will beleeue report.</P>
<P>Next vnto this Citie, in account and commerce, is <HI>Warroicke,</HI> vpon the <HI>North-west banke</HI>
of <HI>Auon,</HI> built by <HI>Gurgunstus,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,</HI> as <HI>Iohn Rosse, Monke</HI> of the place, saith, 375. yeares
before the birth of Christ: by <HI>Ninius</HI> called <HI>Caer-Guaruic</HI> and <HI>Caer-Leon;</HI> and by learned <HI>Cambden</HI>
judged to be PRAESIDIVM, the <HI>Romane Garrisons Towne.</HI> The situation of this place is most plea∣sant,
vpon a hill rising from the <HI>Riuer,</HI> ouer which is a strong and faire <HI>Stone bridge,</HI> and her sharpe
streame vpon the Towne side checked with a most sumptuous and stately <HI>Castle,</HI> the decayes where∣of,
with great cost and curious buildings, the right worthy <HI>Knight</HI> Sir <HI>Foulke Greuil</HI> (in whose person
shineth all true vertue and high nobilitie) hath repaired: whose merits to me ward I doe acknow∣ledge,
in setting this hand free from the daily imployments of a manuall trade, and giuing it full li∣bertie
thus to expresse the inclination of my minde, himselfe being the <HI>Procurer</HI> of my present e∣state.</P>
<P>It seemeth this Towne hath beene walled about, as appeareth by the <HI>Trench</HI> in some places seene,
and two very faire <HI>Gates,</HI> whose passages are hewed out of the <HI>Rocke,</HI> as all other into the Towne
are: ouer whom two beautifull <HI>Chappels</HI> are built; that towards the <HI>East</HI> called S <HI>Peters,</HI> and that on
the <HI>South-west,</HI> S <HI>Iames.</HI></P>
<P>Two faire Churches are therein seated, called S. <HI>Maries</HI> and S. <HI>Nicholas:</HI> but these in, and about
<PB REF="81"/>
the Towne suppressed, S. <HI>Laurence,</HI> S. <HI>Michaels, Iohn Baptist,</HI> and <HI>Iohn of Ierusalem,</HI> beside the <HI>Nunne∣ry</HI>
in the North of the Towne: whose <HI>North Pole</HI> is eleuated in Latitude 52. degrees, 45 minutes,
and is seated from the first point in the West of Longitude, 18 degrees and 45 minutes, being yeare∣ly
gouerned by a <HI>Bailiffe,</HI> twelue <HI>Brethren,</HI> twentie foure <HI>Burgesses</HI> for <HI>Common Counsell,</HI> a <HI>Recorder,</HI> a

<P>(7) Places of most memorable note obserued in this <HI>Shire,</HI> are <HI>Shugbury,</HI> where the precious
stone <HI>Astroites</HI> is found: <HI>Of-Church,</HI> which was the <HI>Palace</HI> of great <HI>Offa</HI> the <HI>Mercian,</HI> and the buriall-place
of S. <HI>Fremund</HI> his sonne: <HI>Chesterton,</HI> where the famous <HI>Fosse-way</HI> is seene. At <HI>Leamington,</HI> so far

after many painefull exploits atchieued, retired, and vnknowne, lead an <HI>Hermits</HI> life, and was lastly
there buried.</P>
<P>(8) The chiefest Commodities in this <HI>Countie</HI> growing, are <HI>Corne,</HI> whereof the <HI>Red Horse Vale</HI>
yeeldeth most abundantly; <HI>Woolls</HI> in great plentie; <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> though the producer of the one
will be the destruction of the other. Such honourable Families as haue beene dignified with the
<HI>Earledome</HI> of this <HI>Shire-Townes</HI> name since the <HI>Normans Conquest,</HI> in the great <HI>Map</HI> it selfe are inserted,
and by their seuerall names expressed.</P>
<P>This County is strengthned with eight strong <HI>Castles,</HI> traded with fifteene <HI>Market-Townes,</HI> inriched
with many faire buildings, and by the deuotion of many <HI>Nobles,</HI> had many foundations of religious
<HI>Monasteries</HI> therein laid. The chiefest were at <HI>Stoneley, Warwicke, Thellisford, Roxhall, Balshall, K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>g∣worth,

Couentree, Combe, Nun-eaton, Asley, Atherston,</HI> and <HI>Pollesworth;</HI> all which came to their period
in the raigne of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, when their rich Reuenewes were alienated to his vse, and those
stately buildings either ouer-turned or bestowed vpon his Courtiers: but yet to Gods glory, and
his diuine seruice, one hundred fiftie eight Parish-Churches therein remaine, dispersedly seated in

<HEAD>NORTHAMPTON-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>NORTHAMPTON-SHIRE, situated neere vnto the middest of <HI>England,</HI> lyeth separtted
vpon the North from <HI>Lincoln-shire</HI> by the Riuer <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land;</HI> from <HI>Hammington-shire</HI> on the East
is parted by the water <HI>Nene:</HI> her South is bounded with <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Oxford shires,</HI> and
the West from <HI>Warwicke</HI> with <HI>Watling-street-way, Auon,</HI> and <HI>Weland,</HI> is diuided from <HI>Lei∣cester-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme of this Countie is large and narrow, broadest in the South-west; and thence
shooting still lesser like vnto a Horne, nor not much vnlike to the forme of <HI>Cornwall:</HI> and from the
entrance of <HI>Cherwell</HI> into this Shire, vnto the fall of <HI>Weland</HI> and <HI>Nene</HI> neere vnto <HI>Crowland,</HI> are by
measure fortie sixe miles; and the broadest part is from <HI>Ouse</HI> vnto <HI>Auon,</HI> which is not fully twentie
miles: the whole in circumference one hundred and nineteene miles▪</P>
<P>(3) The aire is good, temperate, and healthfull: the soile is champion, rich, and fruitfull, and
so plenteously peopled, that from some Ascents, thirtie Parish-Churches, and many more Wind-milles
at one view may be seene: notwithstanding the simple and gentle sheepe, of all creatures the
most harmelesse, are now become so rauenous, that they begin to deuoure men, waste fields, and
depopulate houses, if not whole Towne-ships, as one merily hath written.</P>
<P>(4) The antient people knowne to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and recorded by <HI>Ptolemie,</HI> were the <HI>Coritani,</HI> who
possessed this Country, and were branched further thorow <HI>Leicester, Lincolne, Nottingham, Rutland,</HI>
and <HI>Darbie-shires:</HI> these ioyning with the <HI>Irenians,</HI> with them were fettered with the chaines of sub∣iection,
when for <HI>Claudius, Publius Ostrius Scapula</HI> entred his Lieutenantship in <HI>Britaine,</HI> and in
<PB REF="83"/>
battle subdued all betwixt the Riuers <HI>Nene</HI> and <HI>Sabrina.</HI> But when the <HI>Romans</HI> were content to let
goe that which so long was desired, and had cost so much in the getting, the <HI>Saxons,</HI> a most warlike
Nation put into these parts, and made it a portion of their <HI>Mercian Kingdome:</HI> but their gouernment
also growne out of date, the <HI>Normans</HI> seated themselues in these faire possessions, the branches of
whole Stemmes are spread abroad in these parts, most fruitfull and faire.</P>
<P>(5) Commodities arising in this Shire, are chiefly gotten by tillage and plough, whereby corne
so plentifully aboundeth, that in no other Countie is found more, or so much: the pastures and
woods are filled with Cattle, and euery where sheepe loaden with their fleeces of wooll.</P>
<P>(6) The chiefe Towne in this Shire is <HI>Northampton,</HI> whereof the Countie taketh name, which
for circuit, beautie, and building, may be ranked with the most of the Cities of our Land. It is sea∣ted
at the meeting and confluence of two Riuers, the greater whereof beareth to name <HI>Nen.</HI> This
Towne hath beene built all of stone, as by many foundations remaining to this day is seene, and is
walled about both strong and high, excepting the West, which is defended by a Riuer parted into
many streames. In the depredations of the <HI>Danes, Suen</HI> their King set this Towne on fire, and after∣wards
it was sorely assulted by the disobedient <HI>Barons</HI> of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> who named themselues, <HI>The
Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ie of God:</HI> But the loyaltie of this Towne stood nothing so sure vnto King <HI>Henry</HI> his sonne,
whence the <HI>Barons</HI> with displayed Banners sounded the Battle against their Soueraigne. And yet af∣ter
this a woefull Field of <HI>Englands</HI> ciuill diuision was fought, whence <HI>Richard Neuil</HI> the stout Earle
of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> lead away prisoner that vnfortunate man King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. Vpon the West part of
this Towne standeth a large Castle, mounted vpon an hill, whose aged countenance well sheweth
the beautie that she hath borne, and whose gaping chinkes doe daily threaten the downefall of her
walles. To this vpon the South the Townes wall adioyneth, and in a round circuit meeteth the
Riuer in the North, extending in compasse two thousand one hundred and twentie pases: whose
<PB REF="84"/>
fire so pleased the Students of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> that thither they remoued themselues vpon the Kings War∣rant,
in minde to haue made it on an Vniuersitie: from whence the North-pole is eleuated 52. degrees
36. scruples for Latitude, and in Longitude is remoued from the West 19 degrees and 40 scruples;
being yearely gouerned by a Maior, two Bailiffes, twelue Magistrates, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke,
a Common Counsell of fortie eight Burgesses, with fiue Sergeants to execute businesse.</P>
<P>(7) But the deuotions of the <HI>Saxon-Kings</HI> made <HI>Peterborow</HI> more famous, formerly called <HI>Med∣deswell,</HI>
where <HI>Wolphere</HI> King of <HI>Mercia</HI> began a most stately Monastery to the honour of S. <HI>Peter,</HI>
for satisfaction of the bloud of his two sonnes, whom he had murdered in case of Christianitie:
but himselfe being for the like made away by his mother, his brother <HI>Penda</HI> continued the worke,
with the assistance of his brother <HI>Ethelred,</HI> and two sisters, <HI>Kineburga</HI> and <HI>Kineswith.</HI> This among
the <HI>Danish Desobutions</HI> was cast downe, yet was it againe restored to greater beautie by <HI>Ethelwold</HI> Bi∣shop
of <HI>Winchester,</HI> with the helpe of King <HI>Edgar,</HI> and of <HI>Adulph</HI> his Chancellour, who vpon pricke
of Conscience, that in bed with his wife had ouerlaid and smoothered an Infant their onely sonne,
laid all his wealth vpon the reedifying of the place, and then became <HI>Abbot</HI> thereof himselfe. The
Cathedrall is most beautifull and magnificall, where, in the Quire lie interred two vnfortunate
Queenes: on the North side <HI>Katharine Dewager</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> the repudiate wife of King <HI>Henry</HI> the

<HEAD>RVTLAND-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>RVTLAND-SHIRE, the least of any County in this Realme, is circulated vpon the North
with <HI>Lincolne-shire;</HI> vpon the East and South, by the Riuer <HI>Weland</HI> is parted from <HI>Northamp∣ton
shire;</HI> and the West is altogether held in with <HI>Leicester-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is round, and no larger in compasse then a light horse-man can ea∣sily
ride about in a day▪ vpon which occasion some will haue the Shire named of one <HI>Rut,</HI>
that so rode. But others from the rednesse of the Soile, will haue it called <HI>Rutland,</HI> and so the old <HI>En∣glish-Saxons</HI>
called it, for that <HI>Roet</HI> and <HI>Rut</HI> is in their tongue <HI>Red</HI> with vs, and may very well giue the
name to this Prouince, seeing the earth doth staine the wooll of her sheepe into a reddish colour.
Neither is it strange, that the staine of the soyle giues names vnto places, and that very many: for
haue we not in <HI>Chesse-shire</HI> the <HI>Red Rocke,</HI> in <HI>Lancashire</HI> the <HI>Red Banke,</HI> and in <HI>Wales, Rutland Castle?</HI>
To speake nothing of that famous <HI>Red Sea</HI> which shooteth into the Land betwixt <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI>
which gaue backe her waters for the <HI>Israelites</HI> to passe on foote: all of them named from the colour
of the Soile.</P>
<P>(3) The longest part of this Shire is from <HI>Caldecot</HI> in the South vpon the Riuer <HI>Ey,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>Thistle∣ton</HI>
a small Village seated in the North, not fully twelue miles: and from <HI>Timwell</HI> East-ward, to
<HI>Wissenden</HI> in the West, her broadest extant, is hardly nine: the whole circumference about fortie
miles.</P>
<P>(4) The ayre is good both for health and delight, subiect to neither extremity of heat nor cold,
nor is greatly troubled with foggy mists.</P>
<P><PB REF="92"/>
The Soile is rich, and for Corne and tillage giues place vnto none. Woods there are plentie, and
many of them imparked, hills feeding heards of Neate, and flockes of sheepe; Vallies besprinkled
with many sweet Springs; Graine in abundance, and Pastures not wanting: in a word, all things
ministred to the content of life, with a liberall heart and open hand Onely this is obiected, that
the Circuit is not great.</P>
<P>(5) The draught whereof, that I may acknowledge my dutie and his right, I receiued at the
hands of the right Honourable <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord <HI>Harrington, Baron</HI> of <HI>Exton,</HI> done by himselfe in his yon∣ger
yeares.</P>
<P>Neere vnto his house <HI>Burley,</HI> standeth <HI>Okham</HI> a faire Market-Towne, which Lordship the said
<HI>Baron</HI> enioyeth, with a Royaltie somewhat extraordinary, which is this: If any Noble by birth
come within the precinct of the same Lordship, he shall forfeit as an homage a shooe from the horse
whereon he rideth, vnlesse he redeeme it at a price with money In witnesse whereof, there are ma∣ny
Horse-shooes nayled vpon the Shire-Hall doore, some of large size and ancient fashion, others
new, and of our present Nobilitie; whose names are thereupon stamped as followeth:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Henry Hastings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Roger Rutland.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Edward L. Russell, Earle of Bedford.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Raphe L. Euwer of Parram.</ITEM>

<ITEM>L. Willoughby.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. L. Wharton.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord Shandois.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Besides many others without names.</P>
<P>That such homage was his due, the said Lord himselfe told me; and at that instant a suit depen∣ded
in Law against the <HI>Eirle of Lincolne,</HI> who refused to forfeit the penaltie, or to pay his sine.</P>
<P>(6) Her ancient Inhabitants knowne to the <HI>Romones,</HI> and mentioned in <HI>Ptolemit,</HI> were the <HI>Cori∣tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
and by him branched thorow <HI>Leicester, Lincolne, Nottingham, Darby-shire</HI> and this; who with
the <HI>Icemans</HI> were subdued by <HI>P. Ostorius</HI> vnder the yoke of <HI>Claudius</HI> the <HI>Roman Emperour:</HI> and at their
departure, by conquest the <HI>Saxons</HI> made it a Prounce vnto their <HI>Mercian Kingdome,</HI> whose fortunes
likewise comming to a full period, the <HI>Normans</HI> annexed it vnder their Crowne.</P>
<P>(7) This Countie King <HI>Edward Confessor</HI> bequeathed by his Testament vnto Queene <HI>Eadgith</HI>
his wife, and after her decease vnto his Monastery at <HI>Westminster,</HI> which <HI>William the Conquerour</HI> can∣celled
and made voyd, bestowing the Lands vpon others, the Tithes and the Church vnto those
Monkes▪</P>
<P>That the <HI>Ferrers</HI> here first seated, besides the credit of Writers, the Horse-shooe whose badge then
it was, doth witnesse; where in the Castle, and now the Shire-hall, right ouer the Seat of the
<PB REF="93"/>
Iudge, a Horse-shooe of iron curiously wrought, containing fiue foot and a halfe in length, and the
bredth thereto proportionably is fixed. The Castle hath beene strong, but now is decayed, the
Church faire, and the Towne spacious; whose degree of Longitude is 19. 46. scruples, and the
North poles eleuation in Latitude 53. degrees and 7. minutes.</P>
<P>(8) Let it not seeme offen siue, that I (to fill vp this little Shire,) haue inserted the seate of a
Towne not sited in this County: for besides the conueniency of place, the circuit and beautie, but
especially it being for a time an Vniuersitie, did moue much; yea, and the first in this Iland, if <HI>Iohn
Hardings</HI> Author faile him not, that will haue <HI>Bladud</HI> to bring from <HI>Athens</HI> certaine <HI>Philosophers,</HI>
whom here he seated, and made publike profession of the Liberall Sciences, where (as he saith) a
great number of Scholars studied the Arts, and so continued an Vniuersitie vnto the comming of
<HI>Augustine,</HI> at which time the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> interdicted it; for certaine Heresies sprung vp among
the <HI>Britaines</HI> and <HI>Saxons.</HI> But most true it is, that in the Raigne of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, vpon de∣bate
falling betwixt the Southerne and Northerne Students at <HI>Oxford,</HI> many Schoole-men with∣drew
themselues hither, and a while professed, and named a Colledge, according to one in <HI>Oxford,
Brasen-nose,</HI> which retaineth that name vnto this day. This was so great a skarre vnto the other,
that when they were recalled by Proclamation to <HI>Oxford,</HI> it was prouided by Oath, <HI>that no Stu∣dent
in Oxford should publikely professeor reade the Arts at Stanford, to the preiudice of Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>(9) As this Shire is the least in circuit, so is it with the fewest Market-Townes replenished ha∣uing
onely two. And from Societies that seed vpon the labours of others, was this Land the freest:
for besides <HI>Rihall,</HI> where <HI>Tibba</HI> the <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lconers</HI> Goddesse was worshipped for a Saint, when Supersti∣tion
had well-neere put Gods true honour out of place, I finde very few; neither with more Castles
strengthened then that at <HI>Okham,</HI> whose ruines shew that a Castle hath beene there.</P>
<P>Diuided it is into fiue Hundreds, and therein are planted fortie eight Parish-Churches.

<HEAD>LEICESTER-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>LEICESTER-SHIRE, lying bordered vpon the North with <HI>Nottingham-shire;</HI> vpon the
East, with <HI>Lincolne</HI> and <HI>Rutland;</HI> vpon the South with <HI>Northampton shire;</HI> and vpon the West
with <HI>Watling-street-way</HI> is parted from <HI>Warwick-shire;</HI> the rest being bounded with the con∣sines
of <HI>Darby,</HI> is a Country Champion, abounding in corne, but spary of woods, especially in
the South and East parts, which are supplyed with pit-coales plenteously gotten in the North
of this Prouince, and with abundance of Cattle bred in the hilles beyond the Riuer <HI>Wreak,</HI> which is
nothing so well inhabited as the rest.</P>
<P>(2) The Ayre is gentle, milde, and temperate, and giueth appetite both to labour and rest:
wholesome it is, and draweth mans life to a long age, and that much without sicknesse; at <HI>Carleton</HI>
onely some defect of pronunciation appeareth in their speech.</P>
<P>(3) The soile thus consisting, the commodities are raised accordingly of Corne, Cattle, and
Coales; and in the Rockes neere <HI>Beuer</HI> are sometimes found the <HI>Astroites,</HI> the Starre-like precious
Stone.</P>
<P>(4) The ancient people that inhabited this Countie, were the <HI>Coritani,</HI> who were spread further
into other Shires, but after that the <HI>Romans</HI> had left the Land to it selfe, this with many more fell
to be vnder the possession and gouernment of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and their Kings, from whom the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
enioyeth it at this day.</P>
<P>(5) In Circular-wise (almost) the compasse of this Shire is drawne indifferently spacious, but
not very thicke of Inclosures, being from <HI>East</HI> to West in the broadest part not fully 30. miles, and
<PB REF="94"/>
from North to South but 24. the whole circumference about 196. miles; whose principall Citie is
set, as the Center, almost in the midst; from whom the Pole is eleuated 53. degrees and 4 minutes
in Latitude, and for Longitude, 19. degrees, 22. minutes.</P>
<P>(6) From this Towne the Shire hath the name, though the name of her selfe is diuersly written,
as <HI>Legecestria, Legora, Legeo-cester:</HI> by <HI>Ninius, Caer-Lerion;</HI> by <HI>Mathew</HI> of <HI>Westminister</HI> (if we doe
not mistake him) <HI>Wirall;</HI> and now lastly, <HI>Leicester:</HI> ancient enough if King <HI>Leir</HI> was her builder,
eight hundred fortie and foure yeares before the birth of our Sauiour, wherein he placed a Flamine
to serue in the Temple of <HI>Ianus,</HI> by himselfe there erected, and where he was buried, if <HI>Ieffery ap Ar∣thur</HI>
say true: but now certaine it is, that <HI>Ethelred</HI> the <HI>Mercian</HI> Monarch made it an Episcopall See,
in the yeare of Christ Iesus 680. wherein <HI>Sexwulph</HI> of his election became the first Bishop: which
shortly after was thence translated, and therewith the beautie of the Towne began to decay; vpon
whose desolations that erectifying Lady <HI>Edelsted</HI> cast her eyes of compassion, and both reedified the
buildings, and compassed it about with a strong wall, where, in short time the Cities trade so increa∣sed,
that <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> in his lesser Story reporteth as followeth; <HI>Lege-cester</HI> (saith he) <HI>is a right
wealthy Citie, and notably defended; and had the wall a sure foundation, were inferiour to no Citie what∣soeuer.</HI>
But this pride of prosperitie long lasted not vnder the <HI>Normans,</HI> for it was sore oppressed with
a world of calamities, when <HI>Robert Bossu</HI> the Crouch-backe Earle of that <HI>Prouince,</HI> rebelled against
his Soueraigne Lord King <HI>Henry</HI> the second: whereof heare the same Author <HI>Paris</HI> speake: <HI>Through
the obstinate stubbornesse of Earle</HI> Robert (saith he) <HI>the noble Citie</HI> Leicester <HI>was besieged and throwne
downe by King</HI> Henry, <HI>and the wall that seemed indissoluble, was vtterly raced, euen to the ground.</HI>
The peeces of whose fragments so fallen downe, remained in his dayes like to hard rockes, through
the strength of the Morter cementing whole lumpes together: and at the Kings command the Citie
was set on fire and burnt, the Castle raced, and a heauit imposition laid vpon the Citizens, who with
<PB REF="95"/>
great summes of money bought their owne Banishments: but were so vsed in their departure, that
for extreame feare many of them tooke Sanctuary, both at S. <HI>Edmunds</HI> and S. <HI>Albanes.</HI> In repen∣tance
of these mischiefes, the Author thereof, <HI>Earle Robert,</HI> built the Monastery of S. <HI>Mary de Prae∣tis,</HI>
wherein himselfe became a Canon regular, and for fifteene yeares continuance in sad laments
serued God in continuall prayers. With the like deuotion, <HI>Henry</HI> the first Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> built
an Hospitall for an hundred and ten poore people, with a Collegiate Church, a Deane, twelue Ca∣nons
Prebendaries, as many Vicars, sufficiently prouided for with reuenewes; wherein himselfe
lyeth buryed: and it was the greatest ornament of that Citie, vntil the hand of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8.
lay ouer-heaiue vpon all the like foundations, and laid their aspired tops at his owne feete.</P>
<P>The fortunes of another <HI>Crouch-backe</HI> (King <HI>Richard</HI> the V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>per) were no lesse remarkable in
this Citie then the former <HI>Robert</HI> was, both of them in like degree of dishonourable course of <HI>life,</HI>
though of disterent <HI>issue</HI> at their deaths, the one dying penitent and of deuout esteeme; the other
leauing the stench of Tyranny to all following ages; who from this Citie setting forth in one day
with great pompe, and in Battle aray, to keepe the Crowne sure vpon his owne Helmet, in a sore
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> field, yeelded both it and his life, vnto the head and hands of <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Richmond</HI> his Con∣querour:
and the next day was brought backe, like a Hogge, naked and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and with contempt,
without teares <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> buried in the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y-Fryers</HI> of this Citie; whose suppression hath suppressed
the plot place of his graue, and onely the stone-chest wherein he was laid (a drinking trough now
for horses in a common In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e) retaineth the memory of that great Monarchs Funerall: and so did
a stone in the Church and Chappell of S. <HI>Maries,</HI> inclose the corpse of the proud and pontificall
Cardinall <HI>Wolsey,</HI> who had prepared for himselfe, as was said, a farre more richer Monument.</P>
<P>(7) Otherplaces worthy of remembrance in this Shire were these: In the West, where a high
Crosse was erected, in former times stood the faire Citie <HI>Cleycester,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> BENONNES,
<PB REF="95"/>
where their Legions lay, and where their two principall wayes crossed each other, as the Inhabi∣tants
report; <HI>Loughborrow</HI> in the North-verge, was (as <HI>Marianus</HI> affirmeth) taken from the <HI>Bri∣taines</HI>
by <HI>Cuthwolfe</HI> their King, about the yeare of <HI>Christ</HI> 572.</P>
<P>At <HI>Redmore,</HI> neere <HI>Bosworth,</HI> Westward in this Countie, the Kingdome of <HI>England</HI> lay in hazard
of one Battle, when King <HI>Richards</HI> Field was fought, where the Land at once was freed from a Ty∣rant
and a wicked Vsurper. Neither may we passe <HI>Lutterworth,</HI> as the least in account, where the fa∣mous
<HI>Iohn Wickliffe, Englands</HI> Morning-starre, dispersed the clouds of all Papisticall darknesse, by
preaching the Gospell in that his charge; and stile of his pen, so piercing in power, that the man of
Sinne euer since hath beene better knowne to the world.</P>
<P>(8) Religious houses by Princes erected, and by them deuoted to God and his seruice, the chie∣fest
in this Shire were at <HI>Leicester, Grace-Dieu, Kerby Bellers,</HI> and at <HI>Burton</HI> a Spittle for <HI>Lazers,</HI> a dis∣ease
then newly approched in this Land; for the erection whereof a common contribution was ga∣thered
thorow the Realme: the Patients in this place were not so much deformed in skin, as the o∣ther
were in the defects for the soule; whose skirts being turned vp to the sight of the world, their
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes were discouered, and those houses dissolued, that had long maintained such Idolatrous
sinnes.</P>
<P>(9) This Shires diuision is into six Hundreds, and in them are seated twelue Market-Townes
for commerce, and containeth in her circuit two hundred Parish-Churches.

<P>THe County of <HI>Lincolne,</HI> by the <HI>Normans</HI> called <HI>Nicolshire,</HI> is consined on the North with <HI>Hum∣ber,</HI>
on the East with the <HI>German Ocean,</HI> vpon the South is parted from <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Nor∣thampton-shire</HI>
by the Riuer <HI>Nyne;</HI> and on the West from <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>York-shires</HI> by <HI>Dun</HI>
and <HI>Trent.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The length of this Prouince extended from <HI>Barton</HI> vpon <HI>Humber</HI> in the North, vnto
<HI>Stanford</HI> vpon the Riuer <HI>Nyne</HI> in the South, are miles by our <HI>English</HI> measure fiftie fiue, and the
bredth thereof from <HI>Newton</HI> in the West, stretched vnto <HI>Wintbory</HI> vpon her East Sea containeth thir∣tie
fiue. The whole in circumference about one hundred and eightie miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Ayre vpon the East and South part is both thicke and foggy, by reason of the Fennes
and vnsolute grounds, but therewithall very moderate and pleasing. Her graduation being remoued
from the Aequator to the degree of 53. and the windes that are sent of her still working Seas, doe
disperse those vapours from all power of hurt.</P>
<P>(4) The forme of this County doth somewhat resemble the body of a Lute, whose East coasts
lye bowe-like into the <HI>German Ocean,</HI> all along pestered with inlets of salt waters and sands, which
are neither firme nor safe for trauellers, as those in the South proued vnto King <HI>Iohn</HI> who mat∣ching
North-ward from <HI>Northfolke,</HI> against his disloyall Barons, vpon those washes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

of the yeare, hath beene taken in nets, in <HI>August,</HI> at one draught, aboue three thousand Mallards,
and other Fowles of the like kinde.</P>
<P>(6) The Shires commodities consist chiefly in Corne, Cattle, Fish, Fowle, Flax and Alabla∣ster;
as also in a Plaister much esteemed of by the <HI>Romans</HI> for their workes of Imagery; and where∣of
<HI>Plinie</HI> in his <HI>Naturall History</HI> maketh mention. And the <HI>Astroites,</HI> a precious stone, Star-like, poin∣ted
with fiue beames or rayes, anciently esteemed for their vertue in victories, vpon the South-west
of this County neere <HI>Beuer</HI> are found: not farre thence in our Fathers memory, at <HI>Harlaxton</HI> was
ploughed vp a brasen vessell, wherein was inclosed a golden Helmet of an ancient fashion, set with
precious stones, which was presented to <HI>Kathren</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> Wife and Dowager to King <HI>Henry</HI> the

<P>(7) This Shire triumpheth in the births of <HI>Beauclerke,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, whom <HI>Selby</HI> brought
forth, and of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, at <HI>Bullingbrooke</HI> borne: but may as iustly lament for the death
of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> herein poysoned by <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>non</HI> a Monke of <HI>Swynsted Abbey;</HI> and of Queene <HI>Eleanor,</HI> wife

<HI>Bullingbrooke,</HI> his birth place, ended her life.</P>
<P>(8) Trade and commerce for prouision of life is vented thorow thirtie one Market-Townes
in this Shire, whereof <HI>Lincolne</HI> the Counties namer is chiefe, by <HI>Ptolemie</HI> and <HI>Antonine</HI> called <HI>Lin∣dum,</HI>
by <HI>Beda Linde-collma,</HI> and by the <HI>Normans, Nichol.</HI> Very ancient it is, and hath beene more mag∣nificall,
as by her many ouerturned ruines doth appeare, and farre more populous, as by <HI>Demesdayes</HI>
Booke is seene, where it is recorded that this Citie contained a thousand and seauen Mansions, and
nine hundred Burgesses, with twelue Lage-men, hauing Sac and Soc. And in the <HI>Normans</HI> time, saith
<HI>Malmesbury,</HI> it was one of the best peopled Cities of <HI>England,</HI> being a place for trafficke of Merchan∣dize
<PB REF="97"/>
for all commerce by Land or Sea. Herein King <HI>Edward</HI> the third ordained his Staple for the
Mart of Wools, Leather, and Lead; and no lesse then fiftie Parish. Churches did beautifie the same:
but now containeth onely fifteene besides the Cathedrall. Some ruines yet remaines both of <HI>Frie∣ries</HI>
and <HI>Nunneries,</HI> who lye now buried in their owne ashes, and the Citie conquered not by warre,
but by time and very age: and yet hath she not escaped the calamitie of sword, as in the time of the
<HI>Saxons;</HI> whence <HI>Arthur</HI> enforced their Host: the like also did <HI>Edmund</HI> to the destroying <HI>Danes;</HI> and
by the <HI>Normans</HI> it suffered some dammage, where King <HI>Stephen</HI> was vanquished and taken prisoner;
and againe, by the third <HI>Henry,</HI> that assaulted and wan it from his rebellious <HI>Barons.</HI> By fire likewise
it was fore defaced, wherein not onely the buildings were consumed, but withall many men and wo∣men
in the violence thereof perished: as also by an Earth-quake her foundation was much weake∣ned
and shaken, wherein the faire Cathedrall Church, dedicated to the Virgin of Virgins, was rent
in peeces. The gouernment of this Citie is committed yearely to a Maior, tow Sheriffes, twelue
Aldermen in Scarlet, a Sword, a Hat of Estate, a Recorder, Sword-bearer, and foure Sergeants with
Maces: whose situation on a sleepe hill standeth, for Longitude in the degree 20. 10. scruples, the

is seperated from <HI>Darby-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) For forme long and Ouall-wise, doubling in length twice her bredth, whose extreames

whose circumference draweth much vpon one hundred and ten miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Ayre is good, wholesome and delectable: the Soile is rich, sandy and clayie, as by the
names of that Counties diuisions may appeare: and surely for Corne and Grasse so fruitfull, that it
secondeth any other in the Realme: and for Water, Woods, and Canell Coales abundantly sto∣red.</P>

In the West neere <HI>Worksop</HI> groweth plentie of <HI>Liquorice,</HI> very delicious and good.</P>

was fought by <HI>Iohn De-la-Pole</HI> Earle of <HI>Lincolne,</HI> which <HI>Richard</HI> the Vsurper had declared his heire ap∣parant;

<P>(6) Trade and commerce for the Counties prouision is frequented in eight Market-Townes
in this Shire, whereof <HI>Nottingham</HI> is both the greatest and best: a Towne seated most pleasant and

Rockes: as also in that hill are dwelling houses, with winding staires, windowes, chimneys, and
roome aboue roome, wrought all out of the solide Rocke. The Castle is strong, and was kept by
the <HI>Danes</HI> against <HI>Burthred, Ethelred,</HI> and <HI>Elfred,</HI> the <HI>Mercian,</HI> and <HI>West-Saxon</HI> Kings, who together
laid their siege against it: and for the further strength of the Towne, King <HI>Edward,</HI> surnamed the

thence the foundation may be perceiued to the North; where in the midst of the way ranging with

<P>(2) It is in forme somewhat triangle, though not of any equall distance, growing from
her narrow South-point still wider, and in the North is at the broadest: for from <HI>Stretton</HI>
neere the head of <HI>Mese,</HI> to <HI>New-Chapell</HI> seated neere the head of <HI>Derwent,</HI> the two extreames from

<P>(3) The ayre is good and very healthfull: the sile is rich, especially in her South and East

<P>The ancient people that possessed these parts in the times of the <HI>Romans</HI> assaults, were the

(7) <HI>Little-Chester</HI> (by the <HI>Romish Mony</HI> there daily found) seemeth to haue beene ancient, and

where <HI>Ethelbald</HI> the ninth King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and fifteenth Monarch of the <HI>Englishmen,</HI> slaine at

<P>(8) Things of stranger note are the hot Water-springs, bursting forth of the ground at <HI>Buxton,</HI>
where out of the Rocke within the compasse of eight yards, nine springs arise, eight of them warme,

paces off, receiue another hot spring from a Well, inclosed with foure flat stones, called Saint
<HI>Annes;</HI> neere vnto which, another very cold spring bubled vp. The report goeth among the by∣dwellers,
that great cures by these waters haue beene done: but daily experience sheweth, that they
are good for the stomacke and sinewes, and very pleasant to bathe the body in. Not farre thence
is <HI>Elden hole,</HI> whereof strange things haue beene told, and this is confidently affirmed, the waters that
trickle from the top of that Caue (which indeed is very spacious, but of a low and narrow entrance)
doe congeale into stone, and hang as ickles in the roofe. Some of them were shewed at my being
there, which like vnto such as the frost congealeth, were hollow within, and grew Taper-wise to∣wards
their points, very white, and somewhat Crystall-like. And seauen miles thence, vpon a moun∣ted

which is commonly called <HI>The Deuils Arse in the Peake,</HI> whereof <HI>Geruase</HI> of <HI>Tilbury</HI> hath told

<HI>Temd,</HI> where (in remembrance of him) the place is yet called <HI>Caer-Caradoc,</HI> a Fort of his, wonne by
<HI>P. Ostorius</HI> Lieutenant of the <HI>Romans,</HI> about the yeare of grace 53. The <HI>Cornauji</HI> were feared vpon
the North of <HI>Scuerne,</HI> and branched into other Counties, of whom we haue said.</P>
<P>(6) But when the strength of the <HI>Romans</HI> was too weake to support their owne Empire, and <HI>Bri∣taine</HI>
emptied of her Souldiers to resist, the <HI>Saxons</HI> set foot in this most faire soile, and made it a part
of their <HI>Mercian Kingdome:</HI> their line likewise issued to the last period, and the <HI>Normans</HI> beginning
where these <HI>Saxons</HI> left, the <HI>Welshmen</HI> tooke aduantage of all present occasions, and brake ouer <HI>Se∣uerne</HI>
vnto the Riuer <HI>Dee;</HI> to recouer which, the <HI>Normans</HI> first Kings often affayed, and <HI>Henry</HI> the
second with such danger of life, that at the siege of <HI>Bridge-north</HI> he had beene slaine, had not Sir
<HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bert Syncler</HI> receiued the arrow aimed at him, in stepping betwixt that Shaft and his Soueraigne,
and therewith was shot thorow vnto death. In the like danger stood <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who
in the strait siege of <HI>Ludlow,</HI> begirt by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> had beene plucked from his saddle with an iron
hooke from the wall, had not <HI>Stephen</HI> presently rescued him, <HI>Anno</HI> 1139.</P>
<P>(7) This then being the <HI>Marches</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> was sore afflicted by bloudy broiles,
which caused many of their Townes to be strongly walled, and thirtie two Castles to be strongly
built: lastly, into this Countie the most wise King <HI>Henry</HI> the seauenth sent his eldest sonne Prince
<HI>Arthur,</HI> to be resident at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> where that faire Castle became a most famous Princes Court.
And here King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight ordained the Counsell of the <HI>Marches,</HI> consisting of a Lord Presi∣dent,
<PB REF="106"/>
as many Counsellers as the Prince shall please, a Secretary, an Atturney, a Soliciter, and
foure Iustices of the Counties in <HI>Wales,</HI> in whose Court were pleaded the causes depending and
tearmely tried for the most part in presence of that honourable President.</P>
<P>(8) But the Shire-Towne <HI>Shrewesburie,</HI> for circuit, trade, and wealth, doth farre exceed this,
and is inferiour to few of our Cities; her buildings faire, her streets many and large, her Citizens
rich, her trade for the most part in the staple commodities of Cloth and Freeses; her wals strong,
and of a large compasse, extending to seauenteene hundred pases about, besides another Bulwarke
ranging from the Castle, downe vnto, and in part along the side of <HI>Seuerne:</HI> thorow which there are
three entrances into the Towne, East &amp; West ouer by two faire stone-bridges with Towers, Gates,
and Barres, and the third into the North, no lesse strong then them, ouer which is mounted a large
Castle, whose gaping chinkes doe doubtlesse threaten her fall. This Towne is gouerned by two
Bailiffes, yearely elected out of twentie-foure Burgesses, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and Cham∣berlaine,
with three Sergeants at Mace: the Pole being raised hence from the degrees of Latitude
53. 16. minutes, and from West in Longitude 17. degrees 27. minutes.</P>
<P>(9) Yea, and ancienter Cities haue beene set in this Shire: such was <HI>Roxalter,</HI> or <HI>Wroxcester,</HI> low∣er
vpon <HI>Seuerne,</HI> that had beene <HI>Vricomum</HI> the chiefest Citie of the <HI>Cornauij; Vsoconia,</HI> now <HI>Okenyate,</HI>
neere vnto the <HI>Wrekin:</HI> and vnder <HI>Red-Castle</HI> the ruines of a Citie, whom the vulgar report to haue
beene famous in <HI>Arthurs</HI> dayes: but the peeces of <HI>Romish Coines</HI> in these three doe well assure vs that
therein their Legions lodged; as many other Trenches are signes of warre and of bloud. But as
swords haue beene stirring in most parts of this Prouince, so Beads haue beene bid for the preser∣uation
of the whole, and places erected for the maintenance of Votaries, in whom at that time was
imputed great holinesse: in <HI>Shrewesbury</HI> many, at <HI>Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere, Stowe, Dudley, Bromefeld, Wigmore, Ha∣mond,
<PB REF="107"/>
Lyleshill, Bildas, Bishops-castle,</HI> and <HI>Wenloke,</HI> (where in the Raigne of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; was
likewise a rich Mine of Copper.) But the same blasts that blew downe the buds of such plants,
scattered also the fruits from these faire trees, which neuer since bare the like, nor is likely any more
to doe.</P>
<P>That onely which is rare in this Prouince, is a Well at <HI>Pichford</HI> in a priuate mans yard, where∣upon
floteth a thicke skum of liquid <HI>Bitumen,</HI> which being cleare off to day, will gather the like a∣gaine
on the morrw: not much vnlike to the Lake in the Land of <HI>Iewry.</HI></P>
<P>This Shire is diuided into fifteene Hundreds, wherein are seated foureteene Market-Townes;

<HEAD>The Countie Palatine of CHESTER.
CHAPTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>CHESSE-SHIRE; the Countie <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Chester,</HI> is parted vpon the North from <HI>Lanca-shire</HI>
with the Riuer <HI>Mercy;</HI> vpon the East by <HI>Mercey, Goit,</HI> and the <HI>Dane,</HI> is separated from
<HI>Darby</HI> and <HI>Stafford-shires;</HI> vpon the South toucheth the Counties of <HI>Shrop-shire</HI> and <HI>Flint;</HI>
and vpon the West with <HI>Dee</HI> is parted from <HI>Denbigh shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme of this Countie doth much resemble the right wing of an <HI>Eagle,</HI> spreading
it selfe from <HI>Wirall,</HI> and as it were with her pinion, or first feather, toucheth <HI>Yorke shire,</HI> betwixt
which extreames, in following the windings of the Shires diuder from East to West, are 47. miles:
and from North to South twentie-sixe miles. The whole circumference about one hundred fortie
two miles.</P>
<P>(3) If the affection to my naturall producer blind not the judgement of this my suruey, for aire
and soile it equale the best, and farre exceeds her neighbours the next Counties: for although the
Climate be cold, and toucheth the degree of Latitude 54. yet the warmth from the <HI>Irish Seas</HI> mel∣teth
the Snow, and dissolueth the Ice sooner there then in those parts that are further off; and so
wholesome for life, that the Inhabitants generally attaine to many yeares.</P>
<P>(4) The Soile is fat, fruitfull, and rich, yeelding abundantly both profit and pleasures for man.
The Champion grounds make glad the hearts of their Tillers: the Meadowes imbrodered with
diuers sweet smelling flowers; and the Pasture makes the Kines vdders to strout to the paile, from
whom and wherein the best <HI>Cheese</HI> of all <HI>Europe</HI> is made.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants were the CORNAVII, who with <HI>Warwicke-shire, Worcester-shire,
<PB REF="108"/>
Stafford-shire,</HI> and <HI>Shrop-shire,</HI> spread themselues further into this Countie, as in <HI>Ptolemie</HI> is placed;
and the <HI>Cangi</HI> likewise if they be the <HI>Ceangi,</HI> whose remembrance was found vpon the shore of this
Shire, on the surface of certaine pieces of Lead, in this manner inscribed; IMP. DOMIT. AVO.
GER. DE CEANG. These <HI>Cangi</HI> were subdued by <HI>P. Ostorius Seapula,</HI> immediately before his
great victory against <HI>Caractacus,</HI> where, in the mouth of <HI>Deua</HI> he built a <HI>Fortresse</HI> at the backe of the
<HI>Ordouices,</HI> to restraine their power, which was great in those parts, in the raigne of <HI>Vespasian</HI> the
Emperour. But after the departure of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> this Prouince became a portion of the <HI>Saxon
Mercians</HI> Kingdome: notwithstanding (saith <HI>Ran Higden)</HI> the Citie it selfe was hold by the <HI>Britaines</HI>
vntill all fell into the Monarchy of <HI>Egbert.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of the dispositions of the since Inhabitants heare</HI> Lucian <HI>the</HI> Monke <HI>(who liued presently after the
Conquest) spake;</HI> They are found <HI>(saith he)</HI> to differ from the rest of the English, partly better, and
partly equall. In feasting they are friendly, at meat chearefull, in entertainement liberall, soone angry, and
soone pacified, lauish in words, impatient of seruitude, mercifull to the afflicted, compassionate to the poore,
kinde to their kindred, spary of labour, void of disimulation, not greedie meating, and far from dangerous
practises.</P>
<P>And let me adde thus much, which <HI>Lucian</HI> could not; namely, that this Shire hath neuer beene
stained with the blot of rebellion, but euer stood true to their King and his Crowne: whose loyal∣tie
<HI>Richard</HI> the second so farre found and esteemed, that he held his person most safe among them,
and by authoritie of Parliament made the Countie to be a <HI>Principalitie,</HI> and stiled himselfe <HI>Prince of
Chester.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the third gaue it to his eldest sonne Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> against whom <HI>Lewlyn</HI> Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI> gathered a mightie Band, and with them did the Conntie much harme, euen vnto the Cities
gates. With the like scarre-fires it had oft times beene affrighted, which they lastly defenced with
<PB REF="109"/>
a Wall made of the <HI>Welsh-mens</HI> heads, on the South side of <HI>Dee</HI> in <HI>Hanbridge.</HI></P>
<P>The Shire may well be said to be a <HI>Seed-plot of Gentilitie,</HI> and the producer of many most ancient
and worthy Families: neither hath any brought more men of valour into the <HI>Field,</HI> then <HI>Chesse-shire</HI>
hath done, who by a generall speech, are to this day called <HI>The Chiefe of men:</HI> and for <HI>Natures</HI> endow∣ments
(besides their noblenesse of mindes) may compare with any other Nation in the world:
their limmes straight and well-composed, their complexions faire, with a chearefull countenance;
and the Women for grace, feature, and beautie, inferiour vnto none.</P>
<P>(6) The Commodities of this Prouince (by the report of <HI>Ranulphus</HI> the Monke of <HI>Chester)</HI> are
chiefly <HI>Corne, Cattle, Fish, Fowle, Salt, Mines, Metals, Meares,</HI> and <HI>Riuers,</HI> whereof the bankes of <HI>Dee</HI>
in her West, and the <HI>Vale Royall</HI> in her midst, for fruitfulnesse of pasturage equals any other in the
Land, either in graine from the Cow.</P>
<P>(7) These, with all other prouision for life, are traded thorow thirteene Market-Townes in this
Shire, whereof <HI>Chester</HI> is the fairest, from whom the Shire hath the name. A Citie raised from the
Fort of <HI>Ostorius,</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Britaine</HI> for <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperour, whither the twentieth Legion
(named <HI>Victrix)</HI> were sent by <HI>Galba</HI> to restraine the <HI>Britaines:</HI> but growne themselues out of order,
<HI>Iulius Agricola</HI> was appointed their Generall by <HI>Vespafian,</HI> as appeareth by Monies then minted, and
there found; and from them (no doubt) by the <HI>Britaines</HI> the place was called <HI>Caer Legion,</HI> by <HI>Ptole∣mie,

<P>Ouer <HI>Deua</HI> or <HI>Dee</HI> a faire stone-bridge leadeth, built vpon eight Arches, at either end whereof

built, with foure faire Gates, opening into the foure windes, besides three Posternes, and seauen
<PB REF="109"/>
Watch-Towers, extending in compasse one thousand nine hundred and fortie paces.</P>
<P>On the South of this Citie is mounted a strong and stately Castle, round in forme, and the base
Court likewise inclosed with a circular wall. In the North is the Minister, first built by Earle <HI>Leofrike</HI>
to the honour of S. <HI>Werburga</HI> the Virgin, and after most sumptuously repaired by <HI>Hugh</HI> the first Earle
of <HI>Chester</HI> of the <HI>Normans,</HI> now the Cathedrall of the Bishops See. Therein lyeth interred (as report
doth relate) the body of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, Emperour of <HI>Almane,</HI> who leauing his Imperiall Estate,
lead lastly therein an <HI>Hermites</HI> life.</P>
<P>This Citie hath formerly beene sore defaced; first by <HI>Egfrid</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> where he
slew twelue hundred Christian Monkes, resorted thither from <HI>Bangor</HI> to pray. Againe by the <HI>Danes</HI>
it was sore defaced, when their destroying feete had trampled downe the beautie of the Land. But
was againe rebuilt by <HI>Edelfleada</HI> the <HI>Mercian Lady,</HI> who in this Countie, and Forrest of <HI>Delamer,</HI>
built two fine Cities, nothing of them now remaining, besides the <HI>Chamber</HI> in the <HI>Forrest.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chester</HI> in the dayes of King <HI>Edgar</HI> was in most flourishing estate, wherein he had the homage of
eight other Kings, who rowed his <HI>Barge</HI> from S. <HI>Iohns</HI> to his Pallace, himselfe holding the Helme,
as their supreme.</P>
<P>This Citie was made a County incorporate of it selfe by King <HI>Henry</HI> the seauenth, and is yeare∣ly
gouerned by a <HI>Mator,</HI> with Sword and Mace borne before him in State, two <HI>Sheriffes,</HI> twentie∣foure
<HI>Aldermen,</HI> a <HI>Recorder,</HI> a <HI>Towne-Clerke,</HI> and a <HI>Sergeant of Peace,</HI> foure <HI>Sergeants,</HI> and sixe
<HI>Yeomen.</HI></P>
<P>It hath beene accounted the Key into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and great pitie it is that the Port should decay as it
daily doth, the Sea being stopped to scoure the Riuer by a Causey that thwarteth <HI>Dee</HI> at her bridge.
Within the wals of this Citie are eight Parish-Churches, S. <HI>Iohns</HI> the greater and lesser: in the <HI>Sub∣urbs</HI>
are the <HI>White Fryers, Blacke-Fryers,</HI> and <HI>Nunnery</HI> now suppressed, From which Citie the Pole
<PB REF="110"/>
is eleuated vnto the degree 53. 58. minutes of Latitude, and from the first point of the West in
Longitude vnto the 17. degree and 18. minutes.</P>
<P>(8) The Earledome whereof was possessed from the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> till it fell lastly to the <HI>Crowne,</HI>
the last of whom (though not with the least hopes) is <HI>Prince Henry,</HI> who to the Titles of <HI>Prince of
Wales,</HI> and <HI>Duke of Cornwall,</HI> hath by Succession and right of Inheritance, the <HI>Earledome of Chester</HI>
annexed to his other most happy Stiles: Vpon whose person I pray that the Angels of <HI>Iacobs</HI> God
may euer attend; to his great glory, and <HI>Great Britaines</HI> happinesse.</P>
<P>(9) If I should vrge credit vnto the report of certaine Trees, floating in <HI>Bagmere,</HI> onely against
the deaths of the Heyres of the <HI>Breretons</HI> thereby seated, and after to sinke vntill the next like occasi∣on:

<P>THE Countie Palatine of <HI>Lancaster</HI> (famous for the foure <HI>Henries,</HI> the fourth, fift, sixt, and
seauenth, Kings of <HI>England,</HI> deriued from <HI>Iohn of Gaunt</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster)</HI> is vpon the South
confined and parted by the Riuer <HI>Merscy,</HI> from the Countie Palatine of <HI>Chester;</HI> the faire
Countie of <HI>Darby-shire</HI> bordering vpon the East; the large Country of <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> together

called <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Hebernicum</HI> embracing her vpon the West.</P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is long, for it is so inclosed betweene <HI>Yorke shire</HI> on the East side, and
the <HI>Irish Sea</HI> on the West, that where it boundeth vpon <HI>Cheshire</HI> on the South-side, it is broader, and
by little and little more Northward it goeth (confining vpon <HI>Westmerland)</HI> the more narrow it

and vnknowne deseases.</P>
<P>(4) The Soile for the generalitie is not very fruitfull, yet it produceth such numbers of Cattle,
of such large proportion, and such goodly heads, and hornes, as the whole Kingdome of <HI>Spaine</HI>
doth scarce the like▪ It is a Country replenished with all necessaries for the vse of man, yeelding
without any great labour, the commoditie of Corne, Flaxe, Grasse, Coales, and such like. The
<PB REF="111"/>
Sea also adding her blessing to the Land, that the people of that Prouince want nothing that serues
either for the sustenance of nature, or the safetie of appetite▪ They are plentifully furnished with all
sorts of Fish, Flesh, and Fowles. Their principall fuell is Coale and Turffe, which they haue in
great abundance, the Gentlemen reseruing their woods very carefully, as a beautie and principall
ornament to their Mannors and houses. And though it be farre from <HI>London</HI> (the capitall Citie of
this Kingdome) yet doth it euery yeare furnish her and many other parts of the Land besides, with
many thousands of Cattle (bred in this Country) giuing thereby and otherwayes a firme testimo∣ny
to the world, of the blessed abundance that it hath pleased God to enrich this noble Dukedome
withall.</P>
<P>(5) This Counties ancient Inhabitants were the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> of whom there is more mention in
the description of <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> who by <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperour were brought vnder the <HI>Roman</HI> subiecti∣on,
that so held and made it their Seat, secured by their Garrisons, as hath beene gathered as well
by many inscriptions found in walles and ancient monuments fixed in stones, as by certaine Altars
erected in fauour of their Emperours. After the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> brought it vnder their protecti∣on,
and held it for a part of their <HI>Northumbrian</HI> Kingdome, till it was first made subiugate to the
inuasion of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and then conquered by the victorious <HI>Normans,</HI> whose posterities from thence
are branched further into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>(6) Places of antiquitie or memorable note are these: the Towne of <HI>Manchester</HI> (so famous, as
well for the Market-place, Church, and Colledge, as for the resort vnto it for clothing) was called
<HI>Mancunium</HI> by <HI>Antonine</HI> the Emperour, and was made a Fort and Station of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Riblechester</HI> (which taketh the name from <HI>Rhibell,</HI> a little Riuer neere <HI>Clithero)</HI> though it be a small
Towne, yet by tradition hath beene called the richest Towne in Christendome, and reported to
haue beene the Seat of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which the many Monuments of their Antiquities, Statues, pee∣ces
<PB REF="112"/>
of Coine, and other seuerall inscription, digd vp from time to time by the Inhabitants, may
giue vs sufficient perswasion to beleeue.</P>
<P>But the Shire-Towne is <HI>Lancaster,</HI> more pleasant in situation, then rich of Inhabitants, built on
the South of the Riuer <HI>Lon,</HI> and is the same <HI>Longouicum,</HI> where (as we finde in the <HI>Notice Prouinces)</HI>
a company of the <HI>Longo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icarians</HI> vnder the Lieutenant Generall of <HI>Britaine</HI> lay. The beautie of this
Towne is in the Church, Castle, and Bridge: her streets many, and stretched farre in length. Vnto
this Towne King <HI>Edward</HI> the third granted a Maior and two Bailiffes, which to this day are elected
out of twelue Brethren, assisted by twentie-foure Burgesses, by whom it is yearely gouerned, with
the supply of two Chamberlaines, a Recorder, Towne-Clerke, and two Sergeants at Mace. The
eleuation of who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Pole is in the degree of Latitude 54 and 58. scruples, and her Longitude remo∣ued
from the first West <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vnto the degree 17 and 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. scruples.</P>
<P>(7) This Country in diuers places suffereth the force of many flowing Tides of the Sea, by
which (after a sort) it doth violently rent asunder one part of the Shire from the other: as in <HI>Four∣nesse,</HI>
where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> displeased that the short should from thence shoot a maine way into
the West, hath not obstinately ceased from time to time to flash and mangle it, and with his fell ir∣ruptions
and boysterous Tides to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oure it.</P>
<P>Another thing there is, not vnworthy to be recommended to memory, that in this Shire, not far
from <HI>Fournesse Fell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> the greatest standing water in all <HI>England</HI> (called <HI>Winander-Mere)</HI> lieth, stret∣ched
out for the space of ten miles, of wonderfull depth, and all paued with stone in the bottome:
and along the Sea-side in many places may be seene heapes of sand, vpon which the people powre
water, vntill it recouer a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> humour, which they afterwards boile with Turffes, till it become
white salt.</P>
<P>(8) This Country, as it is thus on the one side freed by the naturall resistance of the Sea from
<PB REF="112"/>
the force of Inuasions, so is it strengthned on the other by many Castles and fortified places, that
take away the opportunitie of making Roades and Incursions in the Country. And as it was with
the first that felt the fury of the <HI>Saxons</HI> crueltie, so was it the last and longest that was subdued vnder
the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> Monarchie.</P>
<P>(9) In this Prouince our noble <HI>Arthur</HI> (who died laden with many trophics of honour) is re∣ported
by <HI>Ninius</HI> to haue put the <HI>Saxons</HI> to flight in a memorable battle neere <HI>Duglasse,</HI> a little Brooke
not farre from the Towne of <HI>Wiggin.</HI> But the attempts of warre, as they are seuerall, so they are vn∣certaine:
for they made not Duke <HI>Wade</HI> happy in his successe, but returned him an vnfortunate vn∣terpriser
in the Battle which he gaue to <HI>Arduiph</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> at <HI>Billangho,</HI> in the yeare
798 So were the euents vncertaine in the <HI>Ciuill Warres</HI> of <HI>Yorke</HI> and <HI>Lancaster:</HI> for by them was bred
and brought forth that bloudy diuision and fatall strife of the Noble Houses, that with variable suc∣cesse
to both parties (for many yeares together) molested the peace and quiet of the Land, and de∣filed

one Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> twelue Dukes, one Marques, eighteene Earles, one Vicount, and three

CHAPTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>AS the courses and confluents of great Riuers are for the most part fresh in memory, though
their heads and fountaines lie commonly vnknowne: so the latter knowledge of great Re∣gions,
are not traduced to obliuion, though perhaps their first originals be obscure, by rea∣son
of Antiquitie, and the many reuolutions of times and ages▪ In the delineation there∣fore
of this great Prouince of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> I will not insist vpon the narration of matters neere
vnto vs; but succinctly run ouer such as are more remote; yet neither so sparingly, as I may seeme
to diminish from the dignitie of so worthy a Country; nor so prodigally, as to spend time in the
superfluous praising of that which neuer any (as yet) dispraised. And although perhaps it may seeme
a labour vnnecessary, to make relation of ancient remembrances, either of the Name or Nature of
this Nation, especially looking into the difference of Time it selfe (which in euery age bringeth
forth diuerse effects) and the dispositions of men, that for the most part take lesse pleasure in them,
then in divulging the occurrents of their owne times: yet I hold it not vnfit to begin there, from
whence the first certaine direction is giuen to proceede; for (euen of these ancient things) there may
be good vse made, eitherby imitation, or way of comparison, as neither the repetition, nor the re∣petition
thereof shall be accounted impertinent.</P>
<P>(2) You shall therefore vnderstand: That the Countie of <HI>Yorke</HI> was in the <HI>Saxon</HI> tongue called
<HI>Ebona-yeyne,</HI> and now commonly <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> farre greater and more numerous in the Circuit of her
miles, then any Shire of <HI>England.</HI> Shee is much bound to the singular loue and motherly ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Na∣ture,
in placing her vnder so temperate a clime, that in euery measure she is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.
<PB REF="115"/>
If one part of her be stony, and a sandy barren ground: another is fertile and richly adorned with
Corne-fields. If you here finde it naked, and destitute of Woods, you shall see it there shadowed
with Forrests full of trees, that haue very thicke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, sending forth many fruitfull and profitable
branches. If one place of it be Moorish, Mirie, and vnpleasant; another makes a free tender of de∣light,
and presents it selfe to the eye, full of beautie and contentiue varietie.</P>
<P>(3) The Bishopricke of <HI>Durham</HI> fronts her on the North-side, and is seperated by a continued
course of the Riuer <HI>Tees</HI> The <HI>Germaine Sea</HI> lieth sore vpon her Bast side, beating the shores with her
boisterous waues and billowes. The West part is bounded with <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and <HI>Westmerland.</HI> The
South-side hath <HI>Cheshire</HI> and <HI>Darbishire</HI> (friendly Neighbours vnto her) with the which she is first
inclosed: then with <HI>Nottingham</HI> and with <HI>Lincolne-shires:</HI> after diuided with that famous Arme of the
Sea <HI>Humber:</HI> Into which all the Riuers that water this Country, emptie themselues, and pay their
ordinary Tributes, as into the common receptacle and store-house of <HI>Neptune,</HI> for all the watery Pen∣sions
of this Prouince.</P>
<P>(4) This whole Shire (being of it selfe so spatious) for the more easie and better ordering of her
ciuill gouernment, is diuided into three parts: which according to three quarters of the world, are
called <HI>The West-Riding, The East-Riding,</HI> and <HI>The North-Riding. West-Riding</HI> is for a good space com∣passed
with the Riuer <HI>Ouse,</HI> with the bounds of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and with the South limits of the Shire, and
beareth towards the West and South. <HI>East-Riding</HI> bends it selfe to the Ocean, with the which, and
with the Riuer <HI>Derment</HI> she is inclosed, and lookes into that part where the Sunne rising, and shew∣ing
forth his beames, makes the world both glad and glorious in his brightnesse <HI>North-Riding</HI> ex∣tends
it selfe <HI>Northward,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in as it were, with the Riuer <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Derwent,</HI> and a long race of the
Riuer <HI>Ouse</HI> The length of this Shire, extended from <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thill</HI> in the South, to the mouth of <HI>Tees</HI> in
the North, are neere vnto seauentie miles, the breadth from <HI>Flambrough-head</HI> to <HI>Horn-castle</HI> vpon the
<PB REF="115"/>
Riuer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is fourescore miles; the whole Circumference is three hundred and eight miles.</P>
<P>(5) The Soile of this County for the generalitie is reasonable fertile, and yeelds sufficiency of
Corne and Cattle within it selfe. One part whereof is particularly made famous by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
Stone, out of which the stones newly hewen be very soft, but seasoned with winde and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
themselues doe naturally become exceeding hard and solide. Another, by a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where∣of
it consisteth, which being burnt, and conueyed into the other parts of the Country, which are
hilly and some what cold, serue to manure and enrich their Corne-fields.</P>
<P>(6) That the <HI>Romans</HI> flourishing in military prowesse, made their seuerall stations in this Coun∣try,
is made manifest by their Monuments, by many Inscriptions fastned in the Walles of Churches,
by many Columnes engrauen with <HI>Roman</HI> work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> found lying in Church-yards, by many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Al∣tars
digd vp that were erected (as it should seeme) to their Tutelar Gods (for they had locall and
peculiar Topicke Gods, whom they honoured as Keepers and Guardians of some particular places
of the Country) as also by a kinde of Brickes which they vsed: for the <HI>Romans</HI> in time of peace, to
auoid and withstand idlenesse, (as an enemy to vertuous and valorous enterprises) still exercised
their Legions and Cohorts in casting of ditches, making of High-wayes, building of Bridges, and
making of Brickes, which hauing sithence bin found, and from time to time digd out of the ground,
proue the Antiquitie of the place by the <HI>Romane</HI> Inscriptions vpon them.</P>
<P>(7) No lesse argument of the pietie hereof, are the many Monasteries, Abbyes and Religious
houses that haue beene placed in this Country; which whilest they retained their owne state and
magnificence, were great ornaments vnto it: but since their dissolution, and that the teeth of Time
(which deuours all things) haue eaten into them, they are become like dead carkasses, leauing one∣ly
some poore ruines and remaines aliue, as reliques to posteritie, to shew of what beautie and mag∣nitude
they haue beene. Such was the Abbey of <HI>Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y,</HI> founded by Lady <HI>Hilda,</HI> daughter of the
<PB REF="116"/>
grand-childe vnto King <HI>Edwine.</HI> Such was the Abbey built by <HI>Bolcon,</HI> which is now so razed and laid
Ieuell with the earth, as that at this time it affords no appearance of the former dignitie. Such was
<HI>Kirkstall</HI> Abbey, of no small account in time past, founded in the yeare of <HI>Christ</HI> 1147. Such was the
renowned Abbey called S. <HI>Maries</HI> in <HI>Yorke,</HI> built and endowed with rich liuings by <HI>Alan</HI> the third
Earle of little <HI>Britaine</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> but since conuerted into the Princes house, and is called <HI>The
Mannour.</HI> Such the wealthy Abbey of <HI>Fountaines,</HI> built by <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urstin</HI> Arch bishop of <HI>Yorke</HI> Such was
the famous Monastery founded in the Primitiue Church of the <HI>East-Saxons,</HI> by <HI>Wilfrid</HI> Arch-bishop
of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and enlarged (being fallen downe and decayed) by <HI>Odo</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> Such
was <HI>Drax,</HI> a religious house of <HI>Chanons.</HI> Such that faire Abbey built by King <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour
at <HI>Silby</HI> (where his Sonne <HI>Henry</HI> the first was borne) in memory of Saint <HI>German,</HI> who happily con∣futed
that contagious <HI>Pelagian</HI> Heresie, which oftentimes grew to Serpentine head in <HI>Britaine.</HI></P>
<P>These places for Religion erected, with many more within this Prouinciall Circuit, and conse∣crated
vnto holy purposes, shew the antiquitie, and how they haue beene sought vnto by confluences
of Pilgrimes in their manner of deuotions: The midst of which superstitious obscurities, are since
cleared by the pure light of the Gospell reuealed, and the skirts of Idolatry vnfolded to her owne
shame and ignominie: And they made subiect to the dissolution of Times, seruing onely as antique
Monuments and remembrances to the memory of succeeding Ages.</P>
<P>(8) Many places of this Prouince are famoused as well by Name, being naturally fortunate in
their situation, as for some other accidentall happinesse befallen vnto them. <HI>Hallifax,</HI> famous, as
well for that <HI>Iohannes defacro Besco,</HI> Author of the Sphere, was borne there, and for the Law it hath
against stealing, and for the greatnesse of the Parish, which reckoneth in it eleuen Chappels, where∣of
two be Parish-Chappels, and in them to the number of twelue thousand people.</P>
<P>In former times it was called <HI>Horton,</HI> and touching the alteration of the name, this prety story is
<PB REF="116"/>
related of it: namely, That a Clerke (for so they call him) being farre in loue with a maid, and by
no meanes either of long prayses or large promises, able to gaine like affection at her hands, when he
saw his hopes frustrate, and that he was not like to haue his purpose of her, turned his loue into rage,
and cut off the maides head, which being afterwards hung vpon an Ewe tree, common people coun∣ted
it as an hallowed relique till it was rotten: And afterwards (such was the credulitie of that time)
it maintained the opinion of reuerence and Religion still: for the people resorted thither on pilgri∣mage,
and perswaded themselues, that the little veynes that spread out betweene the Barke and Bo∣dy
of the Ewe tree like fine threds, were the very haires of the maids head. Hereupon it was called
by this name <HI>Haligfax,</HI> or <HI>Haly-fax,</HI> that is, <HI>Holy-Hayre.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pomfret</HI> is famous for the Site, as being seated in a place so pleasant, that it brings forth <HI>Liquori<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>
and great plentie of <HI>Skiriworts,</HI> but it is infamous for the murther and bloudshed of Princes: The
Castle whereof was built by <HI>Hildebert Lacy,</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> to whom <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour gaue this
Towne, after <HI>Alrick</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> was thrust out of it.</P>
<P>(9) But I will forbeare to be prolixe or tedious in the particular memoration of places in a Pro∣uince
so spatious, and onely make a compendious relation of <HI>Yorke,</HI> the second Citie of <HI>England,</HI> in
Latine called <HI>Eboracum</HI> and <HI>Eburacum,</HI> by <HI>Ptolemy, Brigantium</HI> (the chiefe Citie of the <HI>Brigants)</HI> by
<HI>Ninius, Caer Ebrauc,</HI> by the <HI>Britaines, Caer Effro<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> The <HI>British</HI> History reports that it tooke the name
of <HI>Ebrauc</HI> that founded it; but some others are of opinion, that <HI>Eburacum</HI> hath no other deriuation
then from the Riuer <HI>Ouse</HI> running thorow it: It ouer-masters all the other places of this Country
for fairenesse, and is a singular ornament &amp; safegard to all the North parts. A pleasant place, large,
and full of magnificence, rich, populous, and not onely strengthened with fortifications, but ador∣ned
with beautifull buildings, as well priuate as publike. For the greater dignitie thereof it was made
an Episcopall See by <HI>Constantius,</HI> and a Metropolitane Citie by a <HI>Pall</HI> sent vnto it from <HI>Homorius.
<PB REF="117"/>
Egbert</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> who flourished about the yeare seauen hundred fortie, erected in it a
most famous Library. <HI>Richard</HI> the third repaired the Castle thereof being ruinous, and King <HI>Henry</HI>
the eight appointed a Counsell in the same, to decide and determine all the causes and Controuer∣sies
of the North parts, according to equitie and conscience: which Counsell consisteth of a Lord
President, certaine Counsellers at the Princes pleasure, a Secretarie, and other Vnder-Officers.</P>
<P>The originall of this Citie cannot be fetcht out but from the <HI>romanes,</HI> seeing the <HI>Britaines</HI> before
the <HI>Romanes</HI> came, had no other Townes then Woods fenced with Trenches and Rampiers, as <HI>Cae∣sar</HI>
and <HI>Strabo</HI> doe testifie. And that it was a Colony of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> appeares both by the authoritie
of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and <HI>Antonine,</HI> and by many ancient Inscriptions that haue beene found there. In this Ci∣tie
the Emperour <HI>Seuerus</HI> had his Palace, and here gaue vp his last breath; which ministers occasi∣on
to shew the ancient custome of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> in the military manner of their burials.</P>
<P>His body was caried forth here by the Souldiers to the Funerall fire, and committed to the flames,
honoured with the Iusts and Turnaments both of the Souldiers and of his owne sonnes: His ashes
bestowed in a little golden pot or vessel of the Prophyrat stone, were carryed to <HI>Rome,</HI> and shrined
there in the monument of the <HI>Antoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> In this Citie (as <HI>Spartian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> maketh mention) was the
Temple of the Goddesse <HI>Bellona;</HI> to which <HI>Seuerus</HI> (being come thither purposing to offer sacrifice)
was erroneously led by a rusticall <HI>Augur.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Fl Velerius Constantinus,</HI> surnamed <HI>Chlorus</HI> (an Emperour of excellent vertue and Christian
pietie) ended his life, and was Defied as appeares by ancient Coines: and his sonne <HI>Constantine</HI> be∣ing
present at his Fathers death, forthwith proclaimed Emperour; from whence it may be gathered
of what great estimation <HI>Yorke</HI> was in those dayes, when the <HI>Romane</HI> Emperours Court was held in it.
This Citie flourished a long time vnder the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> Dominion, till the <HI>Danes</HI> like a mightie
storme, thundring from out the North-East, destroyed it, and distained it with the bloud of many
<PB REF="117"/>
slaughtered persons, and wan it from <HI>Osbright</HI> and <HI>Flla</HI> Kings of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who were both
slaine in their pursuite of the <HI>Danes:</HI> which <HI>Alcuine</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>Egelred</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI>
seemed to pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age before, when he said; <HI>What signifieth that raining downe of bloud in S.</HI> Peters <HI>Church
of</HI> Yorke, <HI>euen in a faire day, and descending in so violent and threatning a manner from the top of the roofe?
may it not be thought that bloud is comming vpon the Land from the North parts?</HI></P>
<P>Howbeit, <HI>At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stane</HI> recouered it from the <HI>Danish</HI> subiection, and quite ouerthrew the Castle, with
the which they had fortified it; yet was it not (for all this) so freed from warres, but that it was
subiect to the Times fatally next following. Neuerthelesse, in the <HI>Conquerours</HI> time when (after
many woefull ouerthrowes and troublesome stormes) it had a pleasant calme of ensuing peace, it
rose againe of it selfe, and flourished afresh, hauing still the helping hand both of Nobility and Gen∣try,
to recouer the former dignitie, and bring it to the perfection it hath: The Citizens fenced it
round with new wals, and many towers and bulwarkes, and ordaining good and wholesome lawes
for the gouernment of the same. Which at this day are executed at the command of a Lord Maior,
who hath the assistance of twelue Aldermen, many Chamberlaines, a Recorder, a Towne-Clerke,
sixe Sergeants at Mace, and two Esquires, which are, a Sword-bearer, and the Common Sergeant,
who with a great Mace goeth on the left hand of the Sword. The Longitude of this Citie, accor∣ding
to <HI>Mercators</HI> account, is 19. degrees, and 35. scruples: the Latitude 54. degrees and fortie
scruples.</P>
<P>(10) Many occurrents present themselues with sufficient matter of enlargement to this discourse,
yet none of more worthy consequence then were those seuerall Battles, fought within the compasse
of this Countie; wherein Fortune had her pleasure as well as in the proofe of her loue, as in the pur∣suit
of her tyranny; sometime sending the fruits of sweet peace vnto her, and otherwhiles suffering
her to taste the sowrenesse of warre.</P>
<P><PB REF="118"/>
At <HI>Conishorough</HI> (in the <HI>Britaine</HI> tongue <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aer Conan)</HI> was a great battle fought by <HI>Hengist,</HI> Captaine
of the <HI>English-Saxons,</HI> after he had retyred himselfe thither for his safetie, his men being fled and
scattered, and himselfe discomsited by <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>relius Ambrosius;</HI> yet within few dayes after he brought
forth his men to battell against the <HI>Britaines</HI> that pursued him, where the field was bloudy both to
him and his; for many of his men were cut in pieces, and he himselfe had his head chopt off, as the
<HI>British</HI> History saith; which the Chronicles of the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> deny, reporting that he dyed in
peace, being surcharged and ouer-worne with the troublesome toyles and trauels of warre.</P>
<P>Neere vnto <HI>Kirkstall, Oswie</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> put <HI>Penda</HI> the <HI>Mercian</HI> to flight: the place
wherein the Battle was ioyned, the Writers call <HI>Winwid Field,</HI> giuing it the name by the victory. And
the little Region about it (in times past called by an old name <HI>Elmet)</HI> was conquered by <HI>Eadwin</HI>
King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Aela,</HI> after he had expelled <HI>Cereticus</HI> a <HI>British</HI> King, in the
yeare of Christ, 620.</P>
<P>At <HI>Casterford</HI> (called by <HI>Antonine Legeolium</HI> and <HI>Legetium)</HI> the Citizens of <HI>Yorke</HI> slew many of King
<HI>Ethelreds</HI> Army, and had a great hand against him, in so much as he that before state in his throne of
Maiestie, was on a sodaine daunted, and ready to offer submission.</P>
<P>But the most worthy of memory, was that Field fought on <HI>Pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Sunday,</HI> 1461. in the quarrell of
<HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Yorke,</HI> where <HI>England</HI> neuer saw more puissant Forces both of Gentry and Nobilitie:
for there were in the field at one time (partakers on both sides) to the number of one hundred thou∣sand
fighting men. When the fight had continued doubtfull a great part of the day, the <HI>Lancastrians</HI>
not able longer to abide the violence of their enemies, turned backe and fled amaine, and such as
took part with <HI>Yorke,</HI> followed them so hotly in chase, and kild such a number of Noble and Gen∣tlemen,
that thirtie thousand <HI>Englishmen</HI> were that day left dead in the field.</P>
<P>(11) Let vs now loose the point of this compasse, and saile into some other parts of this Prouince,
<PB REF="118"/>
to finde out matter of other memorable moment▪ Vnder <HI>Knansbrough</HI> there is a Well called <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ping-well,</HI>
in which the waters spring not out of the veynes of the earth, but distill and trickle downe
from the rockes that hang ouer it: It is of this vertue and efficacie, that it turnes wood into stone:
for what wood soeuer is put into it, will be shortly couered ouer with a stony barke, and be turned
into stone, as hath beene often obserued.</P>
<P>At <HI>Giggleswicke</HI> also about a mile from <HI>Settle</HI> (a Market-Towne) there are certaine small springs
not distant a quaits cast from one another: the middlemost of which doth at euery quarter of an
houre ebbe and flow about the height of a quarter of a yard when it is highest, and at the ebbe fal∣leth
so low, that it is not an inch deepe with water. Of no lesse worthinesse to be remembred is S.
<HI>Wilfrids</HI> Needle, a place very famous in times past for the narrow hole in the close vaulted roome
vnder the ground, by which womens honesties were wont to be tryed: for such as were chaste passe
through with much facilitie; but as many as had plaid false, were miraculously held fast, and could
not creepe through. <HI>Beleeue if you list.</HI></P>
<P>The credible report of a Lampe found burning (euen in our Fathers remembrance, when Abbeyes
were pulled downe and suppressed) in the Sepulchre of <HI>constantius,</HI> within a certaine vault or little
Chappell vnder the ground, wherein he was supposed to haue beene buried, might beget much won∣der
and admiration, but that <HI>L. Zius</HI> confirmeth that in ancient times they had a custome to preserue
light in Sepulchres, by an artificiall resoluing of gold into a liquid and farry substance, which should
continue bruning a long time, and for many ages together.</P>
<P>(12) This <HI>Yorkeshire</HI> picture I will draw to no more length, least I be condemned with the <HI>So∣phister,</HI>
for insisting in the praise of <HI>Hercules,</HI> when no man opposed himselfe in his discommendati∣on.
This Country of it selfe is so beautifull in her owne naturall colours, that (without much helpe)
she presents delightfull varieties both to the fight and other senses.

these Coales haue both the like smell and operation of <HI>Bitumen:</HI> for being sprinkled with water, they

<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants knowne vnto <HI>Ptolemie,</HI> were the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> of whom we haue spo∣ken
in the Generall of <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> they being subdued by the <HI>romans;</HI> after whom the <HI>Saxons</HI> made it
a part of their <HI>Northumberlands Kingdom;</HI> at first a Prouince belonging to the <HI>Deirians,</HI> and enioyed
by <HI>Ella</HI> their first King; afterwards inuaded by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and lastly possessed by the <HI>Normans:</HI> whose
site being so neere vnto <HI>Scotland,</HI> hath many times felt their fury, and hath beene as a Buckler be∣twixt
them and the <HI>English;</HI> for which cause, the Inhabitants haue certaine freedomes, and are not
charged with seruice as other Counties are, so that this with <HI>Westmorland, Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI>
are not diuided into hundreds in those Parliament Rolles whence I had the rest: which want
I must leaue for others to supply.</P>
<P>(6) Ouer this Countie, the Bishops thereof haue had the Royalties of Princes, and the Inhabi∣tants
haue pleaded priuiledge not to passe in seruice of warre ouer the Riuer of <HI>Tees</HI> or <HI>Tyne;</HI> whose
charge (as they haue alledged) was to keepe and defend the corps of S <HI>Cuthbert</HI> their great ado∣red
Saint, and therefore they termed themselues, <HI>The holy-werk-folkes.</HI> And the repute of this <HI>Cuth∣bert</HI>
and his supposed defence against the <HI>Scots</HI> was such, that our <HI>English</HI> Kings in great deuotion
haue gone in pilgrimage to visit his Tombe, and haue giuen many large possessions to his Church:
such were King <HI>Egfred, Aelfred,</HI> and <HI>Guthrun</HI> the <HI>Dane, Edward</HI> and <HI>Athelstan</HI> Monarch of <HI>England,</HI>
and zealous <HI>Cannte,</HI> the greatest of all, who came thither bare-footed, and at <HI>Cuthberts</HI> Tombe both
augmented and confirmed their Liberties. This Saint then, of nothing made <HI>Durham</HI> become great,
and <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> of a <HI>Bishopricke</HI> made it a <HI>County Palatine:</HI> at that time <HI>William Careleph,</HI>
<PB REF="120"/>
Bishop of the Diocesse, pulled downe the old Church which <HI>Aldwin</HI> had built, and with sumptuous
cost laid the foundations of a new, wherein S. <HI>Cuthberts</HI> Shrine in the vacancy of the Bishops, was
the Keeper of the Castle-keyes.</P>
<P>In the West of this Church, and place called <HI>Gallile,</HI> the Marble Tombe of venerable <HI>Beda</HI> re∣maineth,
who was borne at <HI>Iaerro</HI> in this Countie, and became a <HI>Monke</HI> at <HI>Weremouth,</HI> whose paine∣full
indust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and light of learning in those times of darknesse are wonderfull, as the volumes which
he wrote doe well declare. And had the idle Monkes of <HI>England</HI> imployed their times after his exam∣ple,
their Founders expectations had not beene frustrate, nor those foundations so easily ouertur∣ned.
But the reuenge of sinne euer following the actions of sinnes, dissolued first the largenesse of
this Counties liberties, vnder the raigne of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First, and since hath shaken to peices
those places herein erected, vnder the raigne of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight: such were <HI>Durham, Sherborne,
Stayndr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, Iarro, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eremouth,</HI> and <HI>Egleton;</HI> all which felt the reward of their idlenesse, and wrath of
him that is jealous of his owne honour.</P>
<P>(7) <HI>Things of rare note obserued in this Shire are three pits of a wonderfull depth, commonly
called the</HI> Hell-Kettles, <HI>which are adioyning neere vnto</HI> Darlington, <HI>whose waters are some what warme.
These are thought to come of an Earth-quake, which happened in the yeare of Grace 1179. whereof
the</HI> Chrenicle <HI>of</HI> Tin-mouth <HI>maketh mention, whose record is this:</HI> On Christmas day, at Oxe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall in the
Territorie of Darlington, within the Bishopricke of Durham, the ground heaued vp aloft, like vnto an high

a noise, that it made all the neighbour dwellers sore afraid: and the earth swallowed it vp, and made in
the same place a deepe pit, which is there to be seene for a testimonie vnto this day.</P>
<P>(8) Of no lesse admiration are certaine stones lying within the Riuer <HI>Weere,</HI> at <HI>Butterbre</HI> neere
<HI>Durham;</HI> from whose sides at the Ebbe and low water in the Summer, issueth a certaine salt reddish

<HEAD>VVESTMORLAND:
CHAPTER XL.</HEAD>
<P>VVESTMORLAND, by some late Latine Writers is c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled <HI>Westmaria,</HI> and <HI>Westmor∣landia,</HI>
by some later <HI>Westmoria,</HI> and in our English Tongue <HI>Westmorland</HI> It came
to be thus named in our language by the situation, which in euery part is so plen∣teously
full of Moores and high hils, teaching one to another, that <HI>Westmorland</HI>
(with vs) is nothing else but a Westerne moorish Country. Hauing on the West
and North-side <HI>Cumberland,</HI> on the South-part <HI>Lanca-shire,</HI> on the East-side <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> and the Bi∣shopricke
of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The length thereof extended from <HI>Burton</HI> in her South, to <HI>Kirkland</HI> in her North-part is 30.
miles: the broadest part from East to West, is from the Riuer <HI>Eden</HI> to <HI>Dunbal rase-stones,</HI> containing
24. miles, the whole circumference about 112. miles.</P>
<P>(3) The forme thereof is somewhat long and narrow: the Aire sharpe and piercing, purging
it selfe from the trouble of grosse foggy mists and vapours, by reason of which the people of this Pro∣uince
are not acquainted with strange diseases or imperfections of body, but liue long, and are health∣full,
and attaine to the number of many yeares.</P>
<P>(4) The Soile for the most part of it, is but barren, and can hardly be brought to any fruitful∣nesse
by the industry and painfull labour of the husbandman, being so full of infertile places, which
the Northern <HI>Englishmen</HI> call Moores: yet the more Southerly part is not reported to be so sterile,
but more fruitfull in the vallies, though contained in a narrow roome, betweene the Riuer <HI>Lone,</HI> and
<HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ander mear,</HI> and it is all termed by one name. The Barony of <HI>Kendale</HI> or <HI>Candale,</HI> that is, the dale
by <HI>Can,</HI> taking the name of the Riuer <HI>Can</HI> that runs through it.</P>
<P><PB REF="122"/>
(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> mentioned in the seuerall
Counties of <HI>Yorke, Lancaster,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>(6) It is not commended either for plentie of Corne or Cattle, being neither stored with ara∣ble
grounds to bring forth the one, nor pasturage to breed vp the other: the principall profit that
the people of this Prouince raise vnto themselues, is by cloathing.</P>
<P>(7) The chiefest place of which is <HI>Kandale</HI> or <HI>Kendale,</HI> called also <HI>Kirkeby Kendale,</HI> standing on
the banke of the Riuer <HI>Can.</HI> This Towne is of great trade and resort, and for the diligent and in∣dustrious
practise of making cloath so excels the rest, that in regard thereof it carrieth a superemi∣nent
name aboue them, and hath great vent &amp; trashque for her wollen cloaths through all the parts
of <HI>England.</HI> It challengeth not much glory for Antiquitie; onely this it accounteth a great credit,
that it hath dignified three Earles with the title thereof, as <HI>Iohn</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> whom <HI>Henry</HI> the
Fift (being his brother) aduanced to that honour, <HI>Iohn</HI> Duke of <HI>Sommerset,</HI> and <HI>Iohn de Foix,</HI> whom
King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt preferred to that dignitie for his honourable and trusty seruices done in the
<HI>French</HI> warres. It is a place of very ciuill and orderly gouernment, the which is mannaged by an <HI>Al∣derman,</HI>
chosen euery yeare out of his twelue Brethren, who are all distinguished and notified from
the rest by the wearing of purple garments The Alderman and his Senior Brother are alwayes
Iustices of Peace and Quorum. There are in it a Towne-Clerke, a Recorder, two Sergeants at
Mace, and two Chamberlaines. By Mathematicall obseruation the site of this Towne is in the de∣gree
of Longitude 17. 30. scruples, from the first West point, and the Pole eleuated in Latitude to
the degree 55. and 15. minutes</P>
<P>(8) Places of memorable note for Antiquitie are <HI>Vertera,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Antonine</HI> the Empe∣rour;
and <HI>Aballaba,</HI> which we contractly call <HI>Apelby.</HI> In the one, the Northerne <HI>English</HI> conspired
against <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour</HI> in the beginning of the <HI>Norman</HI> gouernment. In the other, the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣an
<PB REF="123"/>
Maures</HI> kept a station in the time of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> and their high streete is yet apparently to be
seene by the ridges thereof which lead by <HI>Apelby</HI> to a place called <HI>Brouonacum,</HI> mentioned in the
Booke of Prouinciall notices. The antique pieces of <HI>Romane</HI> Coyne other whiles digd vp hereabouts,
and some Inscriptions not long since found, shew of what continuance they haue beene: although
Time, which deuouteth all things, hath so fed vpon their carkasses many ages together, as it hath
almost consumed both houses and Inhabitants. For <HI>Apelby</HI> now is bare both of people and building;
and were it not for the antiquitie that makes it the more esteemable, in whose Castle the Assises
are commonly kept, it would be little better in account then a village <HI>Verterae</HI> is long since decay∣ed,
and the name of it changed into <HI>Burgh:</HI> for it is commonly named <HI>Burgh</HI> vnder <HI>Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emore.</HI> In
which, it is said, a <HI>Romane</HI> Captaine made his abode with a band of <HI>Directores,</HI> in the declining age
of the <HI>Romane</HI> Empire. These two places <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Newborough</HI> calleth Princely Holds, and wri∣teth
that <HI>William</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> a little before he himselfe was taken prisoner at <HI>Alnewicke,</HI> surprized
them on a sodaine, but King <HI>Iohn</HI> recouered them after, and liberally bestowed them vpon <HI>Robert
V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pont,</HI> for his many worthy seruices.</P>
<P>(9) There is mention made but of one religious house that hath beene in all this Country, and
that was a little Monastery seated neere vnto the Riuer Lod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, built by <HI>Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as</HI> the sonne of <HI>Gospa∣tricke,</HI>
the sonne of <HI>Orms:</HI> where there is a fountaine or spring that ebbes and flowes many times a
day, and it is thought that some notable Act of Atchieuement hath beene performed there, for that
there be huge stones in forme of Pyramides, some nine foot high, and fourteene foot thicke, ranged
for a mile in length directly in a row, and equally distant, which might seeme to haue beene there
purposely pitc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in memory thereof: but what that Act was is not now knowne, but quite worne
out of remembrance by times iniurie.</P>
<P>(10) Other matters worthy obseruation are onely these: That at <HI>Amboglana,</HI> now called <HI>Am∣ble-side,</HI>
<PB REF="123"/>
neere the vpper corner of <HI>Winander mear,</HI> there appeares at this day the ruines of an ancient
Citie, which by the <HI>British-Brickes,</HI> by <HI>Romane-money</HI> oftentimes found there, by <HI>High-wayes</HI> paued
leading vnto it, and other likelihoods, seemes to haue beene a worke of the <HI>Romanes:</HI> The Fortresse
thereof so long fenced with a ditch and rampire, that it tooke vp in length one hundred thirtie two
Ells, and in bredth eight. There are also neere <HI>Kendale</HI> in the Riuer <HI>Can,</HI> two <HI>Catadupae</HI> or <HI>Waterfals,</HI>
where the waters descend with such a forcible downefall, that it compels a mightie noyse to be
heard, which the neighbour Inhabitants make such vse of, as they stand them in as good stead as
Prognostications: for when that which standeth North from them soundeth more cleare, and with
a louder eccho in their eares, they certainly looke for faire weather to follow: But when that on the
South doth the like, they expect foggy mists and showres of raine.</P>
<P>(11) This Prouince is traded with foure Market-Townes, fortified with the strength of seuen

CHAPTER XLI.</HEAD>
<P>CVMBERLAND, the furthest North-west Prouince in this Realme of <HI>England,</HI> confron∣teth
vpon the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is diuided from that Kingdome partly by the Riuer <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir∣so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
then crossing <HI>Eske,</HI> by a tract thorow <HI>Solome-Mosse,</HI> vntill it come to the <HI>Solwaye Frith,</HI>
by <HI>Ptolemie</HI> called the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Baye.</HI> The North-west part is neighboured by <HI>Northumberland,</HI>
more East-ward with <HI>Westmerland,</HI> the South with <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and the West is wholly washed
with the <HI>Irish Seas.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme whereof is long and narrow, pointing wedge-like into the South, which part is
altogether pestred with copped-hilles, and therefore hath the name of <HI>Cop-land.</HI> The middle is more
leuell, and better inhabited, yeelding sufficient for the sustenance of man: but the North is wilde
and solitary, combred with hilles, as <HI>Copland</HI> is.</P>
<P>(3) The ayre is piercing, and of a sharpe temperature, and would be more biting, were it not
that those high hilles breake off the Northerne stormes, and cold falling snowes.</P>
<P>(4) Notwithstanding, rich is this Prouince, and with great varieties thereof is replenished: the
hilles, though rough, yet smile vpon their beholders, spread with sheepe and cattle, the vallies sto∣red
with grasse and corne sufficient: the Sea affordeth great store of fish, the land ouer-spread with
varietie of fowles, and the Riuers feed a kinde of Muskle that bringeth forth Pearle, where in the
mouth of the <HI>Irt,</HI> as they lie gaping and sucking in dew, the Country people gather and sell to the
<HI>Lapidaries,</HI> to their owne little, and the buyers great gaine. But the <HI>Mines Royall</HI> of <HI>Copper,</HI> whereof
this Country yeeldeth much, is for vse the richest of all: the place is at <HI>Keswick</HI> and <HI>Newland,</HI> where
<PB REF="124"/>
likewise the <HI>Blacke Lead</HI> is gotten, whose plentie maketh it of no great esteeme; otherwise a commo∣ditie
that could hardly be missed.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants knowne to the <HI>Romans,</HI> were the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> whom <HI>Ptolemie</HI> disper∣seth
into <HI>Westmorland, Richmond, Durham, York-shire,</HI> and <HI>Lanca-shire.</HI> But when the <HI>Saxons</HI> had o∣uer
borne the <HI>Britaines,</HI> and forced them out of the best, to seeke their resting among the vast Moun∣taines,
these by them were entred into, where they held play with those enemies maugre their force,
and from them, as <HI>Mariama</HI> doth witnesse, the Land was called <HI>Cumber,</HI> of those <HI>Kumbri</HI> the <HI>Bri∣taines.</HI>
But when the State of the <HI>Saxons</HI> was fore shaken by the <HI>Danes,</HI> this <HI>Cumberland</HI> was accounted
a Kingdome it selfe; for so the Flower-gatherer of <HI>Westminster</HI> recordeth: <HI>King</HI> Edmund (saith he)
<HI>with the helpe of Leoline Prince of South-Wales, wasted all Cumberland, and hauing put out the eyes of the
two sonnes of Dunmail King of that Prouince, granted that Kingdome vnto Molcolm King of Scots,</HI> whereof
their eldest sonnes became Prefects. This Prouince, King <HI>Stephen,</HI> to purchase fauour with the <HI>Scots,</HI>
what time he stood in most need of ayd, confirmed by gift vnder their Crowne; which <HI>Henry</HI> the
second notwithstanding made claime vnto and got, as <HI>Newbrigensis</HI> writeth, and laid it againe in
the Marches of <HI>England:</HI> since when, many bickerings betwixt these Nations herein haue hapned,
but none so sore against the <HI>Scotish</HI> side, as was that at <HI>Sallome-Mosse,</HI> where their Nobilitie disdai∣ning
their Generall <HI>Oliuer Sinclere,</HI> gaue ouer the Battle, and yeelded themselues to the <HI>English;</HI>
which dishonour pier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed so deeply into the heart of King <HI>Iames</HI> the fift, that for griefe thereof he
shortly after died.</P>
<P>(6) Many memorable Antiquities remaine and haue beene found in this County: for it being
the Confines of the <HI>Romans Possessions,</HI> was continually secured by their <HI>Garrisons,</HI> where remaine a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HI>Moresby, Old Carleil, Pap-castle</HI> along the Wall, and in many other places, their ruines remaine, with
altars, and Inscriptions of their Captaines and Colonies, whereof many haue beene found, and
more as yet lie hid.</P>
<P>(7) The chiefest Citie in this Shire is <HI>Carlile,</HI> pleasantly seated betwixt the Riuers <HI>Eden, Petterell,</HI>
and <HI>Caud,</HI> by the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>Luguvallum;</HI> by <HI>Beda, Luell;</HI> by <HI>Ptolemy, Leucopibia;</HI> by <HI>Nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Caer-Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lid;</HI>
and by vs <HI>Carlile.</HI> This Citie flourishing vnder the <HI>Romans,</HI> at their departure, by the furious
outrages of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> was deiected, yet in the dayes of <HI>Egfrid</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was
walled about: but againe defaced by the ouer-running <HI>Danes,</HI> lay buried in her owne ashes the space
of two hundred yeares; vpon whose ruines at length <HI>Rufus</HI> set his compassionate eye, and built there
the Castle, planting a Colony of <HI>Flemings</HI> to secure the Coasts from the <HI>Scots,</HI> but vpon better ad∣uisement
remoued them into <HI>Wales.</HI> After him, <HI>Henry</HI> his brother and successour ordained this Citie
for an Episcopall See: whose site is placed in the degree of Longitude from the first West part 17.
and 2. scruples, and the Pole thence eleuated from the degree of Latitude 55. and 56. scruples.</P>
<P>(8) West from hence, at <HI>Burgh</HI> vpon the sand, was the fatall end of our famous Monarch King
<HI>Edward</HI> the first, who there leauing his warres vnfinished against <HI>Scotland,</HI> left his troubles, and soone
missed life, to his vntimely and soone lamented death.</P>
<P>(9) And at <HI>Salkelds</HI> vpon the Riuer <HI>Eden,</HI> a Monument of seuentie seuen stones, each of them
ten foot high aboue ground, and one of them at the entrance fifteene, as a Trophie of Victory was
erected. These are by the By-dwellers called <HI>Long Megge and her daughters.</HI></P>
<P>(10) This County, as it stood in the fronts of assaults, so was it strengthned with twentie-fiue
Castles, and preserued with the prayers (as then was thought) of the <HI>Votaries</HI> in the houses erected
at <HI>Carlile, Lenecoft, Wetherall, Holm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Daker,</HI> and <HI>Saint Bees.</HI> These with others were dissolued by

King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, and their reuenewes shadowed vnder his Crowne: but the Prouince being
freed from charge of subsidie, is not therefore diuided into Hundreds in the Parlament Rowles,
whence we haue taken the diuisions of the rest: onely this is obserued, that therein are seated nine
Market-Townes, fiftie eight Parish-Churches, besides many other Chappels of ease.

<P>(3) The Ayre must needs be subtile and piercing, for that the Northernly parts are most expo∣sed

<HI>Tyne,</HI> where, by the great diligence and industrious paines of good husbandry, that part is become
very fruitfull.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country, mentioned by <HI>Ptolemie,</HI> were called OTTALI∣NI,
OTTADENI, and OTTADINI, which by an easie alteration (as M. <HI>Cambden</HI> saith) if it
<PB REF="127"/>
had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene called OTTATINI, signifying, about the Riuer <HI>Tyne,</HI> or on the further side of <HI>Tyne</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this people were planted) there would haue beene much consonance both with the name of
the Inhabitants, and the Position and Site of the Prouince.</P>
<P>(6) The chiefest commoditie that enricheth this Countie, are those Stones <HI>Linthancraces,</HI> which
we call Sea-coales, whereof there is such plentie and abundance digged vp, as they doe not onely
returne a great gaine to the Inhabitants, but procure also much pleasure and profit to others.</P>
<P>(7) No place of this Prouince vents forth so many of these Sea-coales into other regions as
<HI>Newcastle</HI> doth, being the very eye of all the Townes in this County: for it doth not onely mini∣ster
reliefe (by such prouision) to all other parts of <HI>England,</HI> but doth also farnish the wants of for∣raine
Countries with her plentie. By meanes of this and the intercourse of traffique which it hath,
the place is growne ex<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeding rich and populous. Before the <HI>Conquest</HI> it was called <HI>Monk-chester:</HI>
hauing beene (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>) in the possession of <HI>Monkes:</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> being added, which signifies
a bulwarke or place of defence, shewes that in ancient time it had beene a place of Fortification.</P>
<P>(8) After the <HI>Conquest</HI> it got the name of <HI>Newcastle▪</HI> by the new Castle which <HI>Robert</HI> the Sonne
of <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour</HI> built there, out of the ground. What it was called in old time is not
knowne, yet some are of opinion, that it may be thought to haue beene <HI>Gatrosentum</HI> for that <HI>Gates∣head,</HI>
the suburbe (as it were) of the same, expresseth in the owne proper signification that <HI>British</HI>
name, <HI>Gatrosentum</HI> It is now most enobled both by the Hauen (which <HI>Tyne</HI> maketh) of that no∣table
depth, that it beareth very tall Ships, and is able to defend them against stormes and tempests.
As also by many fauours and honours wherewith it hath beene dignified by p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces: for <HI>Richard</HI> the
second, granted that a Sword should be carried before the Maior, and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt made it a Coun∣ty
consisting of a Corporation within it selfe. It is adorned with foure Churches, and fortified with
strong wals that haue eight gates. It is distant from the first West line 21 degrees and 30 minutes,
<PB REF="127"/>
and from the Equinoctiall liue towards the North-pole thirtie-foure degrees and fiftie-seaven mi∣nutes.</P>
<P>(9) The vtmost Towne in <HI>England,</HI> and the strongest hold in all <HI>Britaine,</HI> is <HI>Barwicke.</HI> From
whence it had the name is not certainely made knowne. Some fetch it from <HI>Berengarius,</HI> a Duke
(neuer read of:) Howsoeuer, this is better to be said then trusted: and whence soeuer it hath the
name, it is seated betweene two mightie Kingdomes, shooting farre into the Sea, with the which,
and the Riuer <HI>Tweed,</HI> it is almost encompassed: and whensoeuer any discord fell betweene the two
Nations, this place was the first thing they tooke care of. It hath endured the brunts of diuers in∣roades
and incursions, and beene oftentimes both possessed and repossessed of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Eng∣lish:</HI>
But since it was reduced vnder the command of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, our Kings haue from time
to time so strengthened it with new workes and fortifications, as they cut off all hopes of winning
it. The Gouernour of this Towne is also Warden of the East Marches against <HI>scotland.</HI> The Lon∣gitude
of it according to Mathematicall obseruation, is 21. degrees and 43. minutes: the Latitude
55. degrees and 48. minutes.</P>
<P>(10) The Inhabitants of this County are a warlike people, and excellent light horsemen, and are
made fierce and hard by the seuerall encounters of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and not much vnlike them in neither,
betwixt whom in this County, many Battles haue beene fought, and the successes oftentimes waued
through very doubtfully, the victory sometimes falling to the <HI>scots,</HI> sometimes to the <HI>English.</HI> At
<HI>Otterburne</HI> was one, in which three or foure times it stood doubtfully indifferent, till in the end the
<HI>Scots</HI> got the vpper hand of the <HI>English:</HI> Howbeit, their glory was not made so illustrious by this
Conquest, but that it was as much darkened by the foile they receiued at <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wicke,</HI> where <HI>William</HI>
King of <HI>Scots,</HI> was taken and presented prisoner to <HI>Henry</HI> the second. As also by that Battell at <HI>Brum∣ridge,</HI>
where King <HI>Athelstan</HI> fought a pitcht field against <HI>Anlafe</HI> the <HI>Dane, Constantine</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI>

and <HI>Eugenius</HI> King of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and that with such fortunate successe, as it hath left matter suffi∣cient
to fill the pennes of Historians. <HI>Flodden</HI> field also, memorable in the death of <HI>Iames</HI> the fourth,
King of <HI>Scots,</HI> who was there slaine, and his Army ouerthrowne in a sharpe fight, as he displayed his
Banner (in great hope) against <HI>England,</HI> when King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight lay at the siege of <HI>Turnay</HI> in
<HI>France</HI></P>
<P>(11) Other Battles in this Countie haue beene, as that at <HI>Hexam</HI> (called by <HI>Bede, Hangustald)</HI>
wherein <HI>Iohn Neuill, Marquesse Montacute,</HI> encountred the Leaders of the <HI>Lancastrian</HI> faction with
much courage, and with greater successe put them to flight, for which he was made Earle of <HI>Nor∣thumberland</HI>
by <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth As also that at <HI>Dilston</HI> (by <HI>Bede</HI> called <HI>Diuelshur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,)</HI> where <HI>Os∣wald</HI>
hauing the faith of Christ for his defence and armour, slew <HI>Cedwall</HI> the <HI>Britaine</HI> in a set battell,
himselfe straight-wayes becomming a professed Christian, and causing his people to be instructed
in Christian Religion.</P>
<P>(12) Many memorable antiquities are found in this Country along the wall, and in other places:
As pieces of Coyne, Inscriptions, broken and vnperfect Altars, &amp;c. (the ruines of the wall yet to be
seene:) but none that deserues more to be remembred then <HI>Wall-Towne</HI> (by <HI>Bede</HI> called <HI>Ad Muru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)</HI>
for that <HI>Segebert</HI> King of the <HI>East-Saxons</HI> was in it baptized in the Christian Faith by the hands of
<HI>Paulinus:</HI> and <HI>Halyston,</HI> where the same <HI>Paulinus</HI> is said to haue baptized many thousands into the
Faith of Christ, in the Primitiue Church of the <HI>English</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>(13) <HI>Busy-gap</HI> is a place infamous for robbing and theeuing, and is therefore rather remembred
as a cautiatory note for such as haue cause to trauell that way, then for any proper matter of worth
it hath, that merits place with other parts of this Prouince.</P>
<P>Other matters of obseruation are onely these, that North <HI>Tyne</HI> (running through the <HI>Wall)</HI>
waters two Dales, which breed notable light horse-men, and both of them haue their hils (hard by)
<PB REF="129"/>
so boggy, and standing with water on the top, that no horsemen are able to ride through them,
and yet (which is wonderfull) there be many great heapes of Stones (called <HI>Lawes)</HI> which the
neighbouring people are verily perswaded were cast vp and laid together in old time, in remem∣brance
of some that were slaine there. There is also a martiall kinde of men which lie out, vp and
downe in little Cottages (called by them <HI>Sheals</HI> and <HI>Shealings)</HI> from Aprill to August, in scattering
fashion, summering (as they terme it) their Cattle, and these are such a sort of people as were the
ancient <HI>Nomades.</HI> The last, not least, matter of note is this, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Morpeth</HI> set their
owne Towne on fire in the yeare of Christ 1215. in the spight they bare to King <HI>Iohn,</HI> for that he
and his <HI>Rutars</HI> ouer-ranne these Countries.</P>
<P>This County hath fiue Market-Townes in it for her trade of buying and selling, 26. Castles for
her strength and fortification, and 460. Parish-Churches for diuine seruice.

<HI>Scotland,</HI> South-ward vpon the Ile of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> East-ward vpon part of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-shire,</HI> and
West-ward vpon the Coast of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme is long and narrow: for from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the <HI>Mull-hils,</HI> where it is longest, it
onely stretcheth it selfe to twentie nine miles; but from the widest part, which is from <HI>Peele-Castle</HI>
to <HI>Douglas-point,</HI> are scarce nine; the whole compasse about, is fourescore and two miles.</P>
<P>(3) The ayre is so cold and sharpe, being bordering vpon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parts, and for her
shelter hauing but a wall of water. They haue few woods; onely they light sometimes vpon so subter∣ranean
trees buried vnder the ground, by digging vp the earth for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lammie kinde of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which
they vse for fuell.</P>
<P>(4) The soile is reasonable fruitfull both for Cattle, Fish, and Corne; yet it rather commen∣deth
the paines of the people then the goodnesse of the ground; for by the industry of the Inhabi∣tants
it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeldeth sufficiency of euery thing for it selfe, and sendeth good store into other Countries.
It hath fields (by good manuring) plenteous of Barley and Wheat, but especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and from
hence it comes that the people eate most of all Oaten-bread. It beares abundance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and
Flaxe, and is full of mightie flockes of sheepe and other Cattell: yet are they smaller in body then
we haue in <HI>England,</HI> and are much like to the Cattle in <HI>Ireland</HI> that are neighbouring vpon it.</P>
<P><PB REF="131"/>
(5) This commoditie makes this Iland more happie then we are here: for the people are there
free from vnnecessary commencements of Suites, from long and dilatory Pleas, and from friuolous
feeing of Lawyers No Iudge or Clerks of the Court take there any penny for drawing Instruments,
or making of Processes All Controuersies are there determined by certaine Iudges, without wri∣tings
or other charges, and them they call <HI>Deemsters,</HI> and chuse forth among themselues, If any com∣plaint
be made to the Magistrate for wrongs eyther done or suffred, he presently taketh vp a stone,
and fixeth his marke vpon it, and so deliuereth it vnto the partie plaintiffe, by vertue of which he
both cals his aduersary to appearance, and to produce his witnesses. If the case fall out to be more
litigious, and of greater consequence then can easily be ended, it is then referred to twelue men,
whom they terme <HI>The Keyes of the Iland.</HI> Another happinesse enricheth this Iland, namely the securi∣tie
and gouernment thereof, as being defended from neighbour enemies by Souldiers that are prest
and ready; for on the South-side of the Ile stands <HI>Bala-Curi</HI> (the Bishops chiefe place of residence)
and the <HI>Pyle,</HI> and a <HI>Block-house</HI> standing in a little Iland, where there is a cōtinuall Garrison of Soul∣diers.
And it is so well managed for matter of rule and ciuill discipline, that tuery man there posses∣seth
his owne in peace and safetie. No man liues in dread or danger of losing what he hath. Men
are not there inclined to robbing or theeuing, or licentious liuing.</P>
<P>(6) The Inhabitants of this Iland are for the most part religious, and louing to their Pastors,
to whom they doe much reuerence and respect, frequenting daily to diuine Seruice, without diui∣sion
in the Church or innouation in the Common-weale. The wealthier sort, and such as hold the
fairest possessions, doe imitate the people of <HI>Lanca-shire,</HI> both in their honest carriage and good
house-keeping. Howbeit, the common sort of people both in their language and manners, come
nighest vnto the <HI>Irish,</HI> although they somewhat rellish and fauour of the qualities of the <HI>Norwegi∣ans.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="131"/>
(7) Things not worthy to be buryed in the graue of obliuion are, that this Iland in the midst
thereof riseth vp with hils, standing very thicke; amongst which the highest is called <HI>Sceafull,</HI> from
whence vpon a cleare and faire day, a man may easily see three Kingdomes at once; that is, <HI>Scotland,
England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> This Ile prohibits the customary manner ofbegging from doore to doore,
detesting the disorders, as well Ciuill as Ecclesiasticall of neighbour Nations. And last, not least,
that deserues to be committed to memory, is, that the women of this Country, wheresoeuer they
goe out of their doores, gird themselues about with the winding-sheete that they purpose to be bu∣ried
in, to shew themselues mindfull of their mortalitie: and such of them as are at any time con∣demned
to dye, are sowed within a sacke, and flung from a rocke into the Sea.</P>
<P>(8) The whole Isle is diuided into two parts, South and North, whereof the one resembleth the
<HI>Scotish</HI> in speech, the other the <HI>Irish.</HI> It is defended by two Castles, and hath seauenteene Parishes,
fiue Market-Townes, and many Villages.</P>

<P>IT is here very pertinent to the purpose, to insert a small History of this Iland, that the atchieuements
heretofore had, may not be vtterly buryed, although they are waxen very old, and almost torne from
remembrance by the teeth of Time. It is confessed by all, that the <HI>Britaines</HI> held this Iland, as they did
all <HI>Britaine.</HI> But when the Nations from the North ouerflowed those South parts, like violent tempests,
it became subiect to the <HI>Scots.</HI> Afterwards, the <HI>Norwegians</HI> who did most hurt from the Northerne
Sea by their manifold robberies, made this Iland and the <HI>Hebrides</HI> to be their baunt, and erected Lords and

<HEAD>A Chronicle of the Kings of MAN.</HEAD>
<P>ANno Dom. 1065. <HI>Edward,</HI> of blessed memory, King of <HI>England,</HI> departed this life, and <HI>Ha∣rald</HI>
the Sonne of <HI>Godwyn</HI> succeeded him in the Kingdome: against whom <HI>Harald Harfager</HI>
(King of <HI>Norway)</HI> came into the field, and fought a Battle at <HI>Stainford-bridge:</HI> but the
<HI>English</HI> obtaining the victory, put them all to flight. Out of which chase <HI>Godred,</HI> surnamed
<HI>Crovan,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Harald the blacke</HI> of <HI>Iseland,</HI> came vnto <HI>Godred</HI> the sonne of <HI>Syrric,</HI> who
Raigned then in <HI>Man,</HI> and honourably receiued him.</P>
<P>(2) The same yeare <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Bastard</HI> Conquered <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Godred</HI> the son of <HI>Syrric</HI> died,
his sonne <HI>Fingal</HI> succeeding him.</P>
<P><PB REF="132"/>
(3) An. 1066. <HI>Godred Crovan</HI> assembled a great Fleet, and came to <HI>Man,</HI> and sought with the
people of the Land, but receiued the worst, and was ouercome.</P>
<P>The second time renewing his Forces and his Fleet, he failed into <HI>Man,</HI> and ioyned Battle with
the <HI>Manksmen,</HI> but was vanquished as before, and driuen out of the field. Howbeit, what he could
not at first bring to passe with power in those two seuerall onsers, he afterward effected by policie.
For the third time gathering a great multitude together, he arriued by night in the hauen called <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sey,</HI>
and hid three hundred men in a Wood, which stood vpon the hanging hollow brow of an hill
called <HI>Sceafull.</HI> The Sunne being risen, the <HI>Manksmen</HI> put their people in order of Battle, and with
a violent charge encountred with <HI>Godred.</HI> The fight was hot for a time, and stood in a doubtfull
suspence, till those three hundred men starting out of the Ambush behinde their backes, began to
foile the <HI>Manksmen,</HI> put them to the worst, and forced them to flie. Who seeing themselues thus dis∣comfited,
and finding no place of refuge left them to escape, with pitifull lamentation submitted
themselues vnto <HI>Godred,</HI> and besought him not to put to the sword such poore remainder of them as
was left aliue. <HI>Godred</HI> hauing compassion on their calamities, (for he had beene nursed for a time
and brought vp among them) sounded a retreat, and prohibited his Host any longer perfuie. He be∣ing
thus possessed of the <HI>Ile of Man,</HI> dyed in the Iland that is called <HI>Ile,</HI> when he had raigned sixteene
yeares. He left behinde him three sonnes, <HI>Lagman, Harald,</HI> and <HI>Olaue.</HI></P>
<P>(4) <HI>Lagman</HI> the eldest, taking vpon him the Kingdome, raigned seauen yeares. His brother <HI>Ha∣rald</HI>
rebelled against him a great while; but at length was taken prisoner by <HI>Lagman,</HI> who caused
his members of generation to be cut off, and his eyes to be put out of his head, which crueltie this
<HI>Lagman</HI> afterwards repenting, gaue ouer the Kingdome of his owne accord, and wearing the badge
of the Lords Crosse, tooke a iourney to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> in which he dyed.</P>
<P>(5) An 1075. all the Lords and Nobles of the Iland<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearing of the death of <HI>Lagman,</HI> dispatched
<PB REF="133"/>
Ambassadours to <HI>Murecard O-brien,</HI> King of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and requested that he would send some worthy
and industrious man of the Bloud Royall to be their King, till <HI>Olaue</HI> the sonne of <HI>Godred</HI> came to
full age. The King yeelding to their request, sent one <HI>Dopnald</HI> the sonne of <HI>Tade,</HI> and charged him
to gouerne the Kingdome (which by right belonged to another,) with lenitie and gentlenesse.
But after be was come to the Crowne, forgetting, or not weighing the charge that his Lord and Ma∣ster
had giuen him, swayed his place with great tyranny, committing many outrages and cruelties,
and so raigned three yeares: till all the Princes of the Ilands agreeing together, rose vp against him,
and made him flie into <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>(6) An. Dom. 1111. <HI>Olaue</HI> the sonne of <HI>Godred Crouan</HI> aforesaid, began his raigne, and raigned
fortie yeares a peaceable Prince. He tooke to wife <HI>Affrica,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Fergus</HI> of <HI>Gal-way,</HI> of
whom he begat <HI>Godred.</HI> By his Concubines he had <HI>Raignald, Lagman,</HI> and <HI>Harald,</HI> besides many
daughters, whereof one was married to <HI>Summerled,</HI> Prince of <HI>Herergaidel,</HI> who caused the ruine of
the Kings of the Ilands. On her he begat foure sonnes, <HI>Dulgal, Raignald, Engus,</HI> and <HI>Olaue.</HI></P>
<P>(7) An. Dom. 1144 <HI>Godred</HI> the sonne of <HI>Olaue,</HI> was created King of <HI>Man,</HI> and raigned thiritie
yeares. In the third yeare of his raigne the people of <HI>Dublin</HI> sent for him, and made him their King.
Which <HI>Mure-card</HI> King of <HI>Ireland</HI> maligning, raised warre, and sent <HI>Osibeley</HI> his halfe brother by
the mothers side with 3000. men at Armes to <HI>Dublin,</HI> who by <HI>Godred</HI> and the <HI>Dublinians</HI> was slaine,
and the rest all put to flight. These atchieuements made, <HI>Godred</HI> returned to <HI>Man,</HI> and began to vse
tyranny, turning the Noblemen out of their inheritances. Whereupon one called <HI>Thorfin (vtters</HI>
sonne) being mightier then the rest, came to <HI>Summerled,</HI> and made <HI>Dulgal (Summerleds</HI> sonne)
King of the Ilands: whereof <HI>Godred</HI> hauing intelligence, prepared a Nauie of 80. Shippes to meet
<HI>Summerled.</HI> And in the yeare 1156. there was a Battle fought at Sea on Twelfth day at night, and
many slaine on both sides But the next day they grew to a pacification, and diuided the Kingdome
<PB REF="133"/>
of the Ilands among themselues. This was the cause of the ouerthrow of the Kingdome of the
Iles.</P>
<P>(8) Ann 1158. <HI>Summerled</HI> came to <HI>Man,</HI> with a fleet of fiftie three saile, put <HI>Godred</HI> to flight,
and wasted the Iland. <HI>Godred</HI> vpon this crossed ouer to <HI>Norway</HI> for ayde against <HI>Summerled.</HI> But
<HI>Summerled</HI> in the meane time arriuing at <HI>Rhinfrin,</HI> and hauing gathered together: fleet of 160 ships,
couerting to subdue all <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the rust iudgement of God, was vanquished by a few, and both
himselfe and his sonne slaine, with an infinite number of people.</P>
<P>(9) The fourth day after, <HI>Raignald,</HI> began to raigne, but <HI>Godred</HI> comming vpon him out of
<HI>Norway</HI> with a great multitude of Armed men, tooke his brother <HI>Raignald,</HI> and be rest him both of
his eyes and genitall members. On the fourth Ides of <HI>Nouember,</HI> An. Dom. 1187. <HI>Godred</HI> King of
the Ilands dyed, and his body was translated to the <HI>Ile of Ely▪</HI> He left behinde him three sonnes,
<HI>Raignald, Olaue,</HI> and <HI>Yuar.</HI> He ordained in his life time that <HI>Olaue</HI> should succeed him, because he
onely was borne legitimate. But the people of <HI>Man</HI> seeing him to be scarce ten yeares old, sent for
<HI>Raignald,</HI> and made him their King. I his caused great diuision, and many turbulent attempts be∣tweene
the two Brethren for the space of thirtie eight yeares; which had no end, till at a place cal∣led
<HI>Tnigualla</HI> there was a battle strucke betweene them, wherein <HI>Olaue</HI> had the victory, and <HI>Raignald</HI>
was slaine. The Monkes of <HI>Russin</HI> translated his body vnto the Abbey of S. <HI>Mary de Fournes,</HI> and
there interred it in a place which himselfe had chosen for that purpose.</P>
<P>(10) An. 1230. <HI>Olaue</HI> and <HI>Godred Don</HI> (who was <HI>Raignalds</HI> sonne) with the <HI>Norwegians</HI> came
to <HI>Man,</HI> and diuided the Kingdome among themselues. <HI>Olaue</HI> held <HI>Man,</HI> and <HI>Godred</HI> being gone vn∣to
the Ilands, was slaine in the Ile <HI>Lodhus</HI> So <HI>Olaue</HI> obtained the Kingdome of the Isses. He dyed

<P>(14) In the yeare 1252. <HI>Magnus,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Olaue,</HI> came to <HI>Man</HI> and was made King. The next

<P>(16) In the yeare 1266. the Kingdome of the Ilands was translated, by reason of <HI>Alexander</HI>
King of <HI>Scots,</HI> who had gotten into his hands the Westerne Ilands, and brought the <HI>Ile of Man</HI> vn∣der

Crowne thereof vnto <HI>William Scroope</HI> for a great summe of money But he being beheaded for high
Treason, and his goods confiscate, it came into the hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, King of <HI>England,</HI>

<HEAD>HOLY ILAND.
CHAPTER XLV.</HEAD>
<P>THis Iland is called <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> by the Riuer <HI>Lied</HI> that is opposite vnto it on the Coast of
<HI>Northumberland. Beda</HI> termeth it a <HI>Deiny Iland.</HI> The <HI>Britaine</HI> name it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, for that
it twice euery day suffreth an extraordinary inundation and ouer-flowing of the Ocean in
manner of an Iland, which twice likewise makes it continent to the Land, and returning vn∣to
her watrie habitation, layes the Shoare bare againe, as before. It is called in English,
<HI>Holy-Iland,</HI> for that in ancient times many <HI>Monkes</HI> haue beene accustomed to retire themselues thi∣ther,
and to make it their receptacle for solitude: hauing on the West and South, <HI>Northumberland,</HI>
and more South-Eastward the Iland <HI>Farne.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme of it is long and narrow, the West side narrower then the East, and are both
conioyned by a very small spang of land that is left vnto Comes. The South is much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then
the rest It is from East to West, about two thousand two hundred and fiftie pases; and from North
to South, twelue hundred and fiftie pases; so that the circumference cannot be great.</P>
<P>(3) The ayre is not very good either for health or delight, as being seated on those parts that
are subiect to extremitie of cold, and greatly troubled with vapours and toggy mists that arise from
the Seas.</P>
<P>(4) The soile cannot be rich, being rockie and full of stones, and vnfit for Corne and T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>age.
It is neither commended for hils to seed sheepe, nor pastures to fit Cattle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
replenished with sweet springs, or running riuellets, onely one excepted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> standing
pond. The onely thing this Iland yeeldeth, is a stand accomodate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and fow∣ling.</P>
<P><PB REF="136"/>
(5) Notwithstanding, this is very worthy of note concerning the same, which <HI>Alcun</HI> wrote in
an Epistle to <HI>Egelred</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> namely, that it was a place more venerable then all
the places of <HI>Britaine,</HI> and that after the departure of S. <HI>Paulinus</HI> from <HI>Yorke,</HI> there Christian Reli∣gion
began in their Nation, though afterwards it there felt the first beginning of misery and cala∣mitie,
being left to the spoyle of Pagans and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>oants.</P>
<P>(6) It is also remembred of this Iland, that sometimes there hath beene in it an Episcopall See,
which <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dan</HI> the <HI>Scot</HI> instituted (being called thither to Preach the Christian Faith to the people of
<HI>Northumberland)</HI> being thus delighted with the solitary situation thereof, as a most fit place for re∣tire.
But afterwards when the <HI>Danes</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isled and robbed all the Sea-Coasts, the Episcopall See was
translated to <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>(7) This Iland so small in account either for compasse or Commoditie, and so vnpeopled and
vnprofitable, cannot be numerous in Townes and Villages. It hath in it onely one Towne, with a
Church and a Castle, vnder which there is a commodious Hauen, defended with a Block-house, si∣tuate
vpon in hill towards the South-East.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FARNEILE.</HEAD>
<P>THis Ile South-eastward seuen miles from <HI>Holy Iland,</HI> sheweth it selfe distant almost two miles
from <HI>Bambrough</HI> Castle. On the West and South it beareth vpon <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and on
the North-east-side it hath other smaller Ilands adioyning to it, as <HI>Widopens</HI> &amp; <HI>Staple Iland,</HI>
which lie two miles off <HI>Bronsinan,</HI> and two lesser then these, which are called the <HI>Wambes.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme of this Ile is round, and no larger in compasse then may easily be ridden
<PB REF="136"/>
in one halfe of a day. The bredth of it is but fiue miles, and the length no more. The whole circum∣ference
extends it selfe no further then to fifteene miles.</P>
<P>(3) The ayre is very vnwholesome, and subiect both to many <HI>Dysenteries</HI> and other diseases,
by reason of the mistie fogges and exhalations that are thereunto drawne vp from the Ocean. It is
many times troubled with vnusuall tempests of windes, with boisterous fury of stormy raines, and
with seuerall and vncouth rages of the Sea.</P>
<P>(4) The soile cannot be fertile, being encircled about with craggy clifts; neither hath it in it
much matter either of pleasure or profit. It can neither defend it selfe from cold, lacking fuell, as
Wood, Coale, Turffes, &amp;c. nor from famine, wanting food, as Corne, Pastures, Cattle, &amp;c. The best
commoditie it yeelds, is Fish and Fowle.</P>
<P>(5) This thing neuerthelesse is worthy to be remembred of it, which <HI>Beda</HI> (writing of the life of
<HI>Cuthbert</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> that <HI>Tutelar Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron</HI> of the <HI>Northerne Englishmen)</HI> reporteth, namely,
that in this Ile he built a Citie fitting his gouernment, and erected certaine houses in the same; the
whole building standing almost round in compasse, and reaching the space of foure or fiue pearches.
The wall about it he made higher then a mans height, to with-hold and keepe in the want on lasciui∣ousnesse
both of his thoughts and eyes, and to eleuate the whole intention of his minde vp to hea∣uenly
desires, that he might wholly giue himselfe to the seruice of God. But these are all made the
ruines of time, as sithence many other Monuments haue beene, of worthy antiquitie.</P>
<P>(6) I cannot report that there are now many houses standing in it, much lesse Townes or Vil∣lages.
Onely this, that it hath a Tower or place of Fortification belonging vnto it, placed well-neere
in the middle part of the Ile.</P>

<HEAD>GARNSEY.</HEAD>
<P>THis <HI>Iland</HI> lieth about fiue leagues Northwest from <HI>Iersey,</HI> and is compassed (like to her neigh∣bour)
with the <HI>British Sea.</HI> It lieth in length from <HI>Plymouth</HI> bay South-west, to <HI>Lancrosse de
Ancke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Northeast, thirteene miles: in bredth from S. <HI>Martins point</HI> Southeast, to the <HI>Howe</HI>
Northwest nine miles; and is in circuit thirtie sixe miles. The Emperour <HI>Antonine</HI> hauing
the rule and domination of <HI>France</HI> (at that time called <HI>Gaule,</HI> from whence the word <HI>Gallia</HI>
is deriued) did name this Iland <HI>Sarnia,</HI> which afterward by the change of Times and corruption of
Languages, was long since (and is at this day) called <HI>Garnsey.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Ile in forme and fashion standeth in the Sea, much like to a Parke that is incompassed
round about with a Pale of Rockes, being very defensible vnto the Iland from the attempting inno∣uation
of enemies.</P>
<P>(3) The Aire and Climate of this Ile hath little or no difference in temper or qualitie from that
of <HI>Iersey.</HI> And this deserues to be remembred of it; that in this Ile is neither Toade, Snake, Adder,
or any other venemous creature, and the other hath great plentie.</P>
<P>(4) It standeth for the most part vpon a rocke, very high in many places from the Sea. Neuer∣thelesse
the Soile is very fruitfull, yeelding forth great plentie of grasse for their Sheepe and other
Cattell, which they haue to serue all vses▪ Their fields in the Summer time are so naturally garni∣shed
with flowers of all sorts, that a man (being there) might conceit himselfe to be in a pleasant
artificiall garden.</P>
<P>(5) The Inhabitants are not so much giuen to tillage as they of <HI>Iersey,</HI> though the soile be as
fruitfull. They haue of late taken great delight in planting and setting of trees of all sorts, and espe∣cially
of Apples, by reason whereof they make much Cider. Their commodities are alike, and their
helpes from the Sea no lesse, or rather more.</P>
<P><PB REF="137"/>
(6) In this Ile are many great steepe Rocks, among which is found a hard stone called by the
<HI>Frenchmen Smyris,</HI> which we terme <HI>Emerill.</HI> This stone is seruiceable for many purposes, and many
Trades, as Glasiers, &amp;c. but especially for the Goldsmiths and Lapidaries, to cut their precious
stones.</P>
<P>(7) It hath a head of Land vpon the North part thereof, the passage into which is so narrow,
that a man would thinke that at euery Tyde (the Sea beating strongly on both sides) it were in a
continuall danger to be sundred from the other part of the Ile. This place is called S. <HI>Michaelin the
Vale,</HI> where (in former times) stood a Priory, or a Couent of religious persons, the ruines where∣of
are at this day to be seene.</P>
<P>(8) The gouernment of this Ile, in nature and forme resembles the other of <HI>Iersey,</HI> of whom
shall be said. The people in their Originall and Language alike also, but in their customes and
conditions they come neerer the ciuill fashions of the <HI>English.</HI> Other matters of moment I finde
not worthy to be recorded.</P>
<P>It hath ten Parishes, and one Market-Towne, being also a Hauen, and is called S. <HI>Peters Port,</HI>
built close by the <HI>Peere,</HI> and <HI>Castle Cornet.</HI></P>

<HEAD>IERSEY.</HEAD>
<P>THe two Ilands <HI>Iersey</HI> and <HI>Garnsey,</HI> being the onely remaines of the Dukedome of <HI>Norman∣die,</HI>
that in former times many yeares together was in the possession, and vnder the command
of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> annexing thereunto a large Territory and glorious title to the
Crowne, are both seated in the Sea called <HI>Mare Britannicum,</HI> the Ocean parting them a good
distant asunder, and are now both adiuncts, and within the circuit of <HI>Hampshire.</HI> For the first
(being the Isle of <HI>Iersey)</HI> it lyeth vpon the <HI>British Sea,</HI> hauing on the North parts the coasts of
<HI>Hampshire,</HI> and on the South the Country of <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Iland is long, not much vnlike the fashion of an Egge. It containes in length from
<HI>Sentwon Poole</HI> vpon the West, to <HI>Mount Orguil</HI> Castle on the East, ten miles, and in bredth from <HI>Du∣bon
point</HI> to <HI>Plymount-bay</HI> six miles: the whole circuit of the Iland being thirtie eight miles▪ It is di∣stant
from a little Iland called <HI>Alderney,</HI> about foure leagues. It was in old time called <HI>Caesaria;</HI> whe∣ther
from <HI>Iulius Octanius,</HI> or any the other <HI>Caesars</HI> that followed, is vnknowne. But the <HI>French-men</HI>
haue by corruption of speech long time called it <HI>Iersey.</HI></P>
<P>(3) It is a very delightsome and healthfull Iland, and giueth a pleasant aspect vnto the Seas.
It lyeth Southward not farre from a craggie ridge of rocks, which is much feared of the Mariners,
and makes the passage that way very dangerous, howbeit it serues for a forcible defence against Pi∣rats,
or any strangers that attempt inuasion, and they are termed <HI>Casquets.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The Soile is very fertile, bringing forth store of Corne and Cattle, but especially of sheepe,
that are of reasonable bignesse, the most of them bearing foure hornes a peece: Their wooll very fine
and white, of which the Inhabitants make their Iersey stockings, which are ordinarily to be had in
most parts of <HI>England,</HI> and yeeld a great commoditie vnto the Iland.</P>
<P>(5) The first originall of the Inhabitants sprung either from the <HI>Normans,</HI> or <HI>Britaines,</HI> or both.
<PB REF="138"/>
They speake <HI>French,</HI> though after a corrupt manner, and haue continued their names, language, cu∣stomes,
and Country, without any, or little intermixture, these many hundred yeares, hauing beene
vnder the jurisdiction of the <HI>English</HI> euer since the vntimely and vnnaturall death of <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of
<HI>Normandie,</HI> eldest sonne to <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour.</HI></P>
<P>(6) The people of this Country liue very pleasantly, as well by the profits of the Land, as the
helpes and furtherances of the Sea, that yeelds vnto them (and especially in Summer season) great
store of fish, but principally Conger and Lobsters, the greatest and fattest vpon the coast of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
Wood is very scant, for their best fuell is Turffe: some Coale they haue brought vnto them,
but it is very deare; straw, furre, and ferne seruing their ordinary vses. The middle part of the Iland
hath many prety Hils rising in it, yeelding a delightfull obiect vnto the vallies, that receiue from
one another a mutuall pleasure.</P>
<P>(7) The Gouernour of the Ile is the Captaine thereof, who appointeth certaine Officers vn∣der
him: the principall of whom, carrieth the name and title of a Bailiffe, that in ciuill causes hath
the assistance of twelue Iurats to determine of differences, and minister Iustice: in criminall mat∣ters
seuen: in matters of reason and conscience, fiue. Their twelue are chosen out of the twelue Pa∣rishes:
so that no man goeth further to complaine, then to his owne Iurate in ordinary Controuer∣sies;
but matters of moment and difficultie are determined before the Bailiffe in a generall mee∣ting.</P>
<P>(8) This Ile hath two little Ilands adiacent; the one S. <HI>Albons,</HI> the other <HI>Hillary Iland.</HI> It hath
twelue Parishes, and foure Castles. No other Monuments of name or note.

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF WALES.
CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>ANtiquitie hath auouched, that the whole Isle of <HI>Britaine</HI> was diuided into three parts▪ The
first and fairest lay contained within the <HI>French</HI> Seas, the Riuers of <HI>Seuerne, Dee,</HI> and <HI>Hum∣ber,</HI>
called then <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oyger,</HI> which name yet it retaineth in <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh;</HI> in <HI>English</HI> called <HI>England.</HI>
The second part occupied all the land Northward from <HI>Humber,</HI> to the <HI>Orkney</HI> Sea, called
by the <HI>Latines, Mare Caledonium,</HI> or <HI>Deucaledonium,</HI> now famously knowne by the name of
<HI>Scotland.</HI> The third part was this, lying betwixt the <HI>Irish</HI> Seas, the Riuers <HI>Seuerne</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> and was
called <HI>Cambria,</HI> which name doth yet continue with them, though we, the <HI>English,</HI> call it <HI>Wales,</HI> as the
people <HI>Welshmen,</HI> which is <HI>strange</HI> and <HI>strangers;</HI> for so at this day the dwellers of <HI>Tyroll</HI> in the high∣er
<HI>Germany,</HI> whence our <HI>Saxons</HI> are said to haue come, doe name the <HI>Italian</HI> (their next neighbour)
a <HI>Welshman,</HI> and his language <HI>Welsh.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This opinion <HI>Verstegan</HI> doth altogether contradict, rather iudging by the ancient <HI>Tentonicks</HI>
tongue, which the <HI>Germans</HI> spake, and wherein the <HI>G.</HI> is pronounced for <HI>W.</HI> that these <HI>Saxons</HI> called
them <HI>Gallish</HI> from the <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les,</HI> whence their originall proceeded, rather then <HI>Wallish</HI> from strangers:
which he thinketh could not be, considering their habitations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o neere vnto them; and that the like
was in vse, he proueth by the words of <HI>French, Gardian</HI> for <HI>Wardian, Corangalles</HI> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yea,
and <HI>Galles</HI> for <HI>Wales,</HI> calling our most famous <HI>Edward,</HI> Prince of <HI>Galles,</HI> not Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> inso∣much
that the County of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> bordering along vpon the <HI>Germans,</HI> was of them called <HI>Gallia

and all because of the language or lineage of the <HI>Gaules.</HI> Neither do the meere Natiues of <HI>Wales</HI>
know any other name of their Country then <HI>Cambria,</HI> of themselues, then <HI>Cambri</HI> or <HI>Cumri,</HI> or of their
language then <HI>Cambraoc.</HI> But leauing this opinion free to his affection, we will proceed▪</P>
<P>(3) <HI>Wales</HI> therefore being anciently bounded as before, the <HI>Saxons</HI> did afterwards win by force
from the <HI>Britaines,</HI> all the plaine and champion Country ouer the Riuer <HI>Dee;</HI> and especially <HI>Offa</HI>
King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> made their limits straiter, by making a ditch of great bredth &amp; depth, to be a Meere

It is plentifull of Cattle, Fish, and Fowle, as also of Corne: and is diuided in the middest with the
Riuer <HI>Clwyd,</HI> to which run a number of other Riuers from the hilles. In this part is <HI>Dyffryn Clwyd,</HI>
the fairest Valley within <HI>Wales,</HI> containing eighteene miles in length, and seauen in breadth. In
which is the Towne and Castle of <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> neere vnto the Sea; and not farre thence, S. <HI>Assaph,</HI> an
Episcopall seat, betweene the Riuers <HI>Clwyd</HI> and <HI>Elwy.</HI> Herein stands the faire Towne and goodly
Castle of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> situated vpon a Rocke, the greatest Market-Towne of <HI>North-Wales:</HI> and from
thence is seene the Towne and Castle of <HI>Ruthyn,</HI> faire for prospect, and fruitfull for site. This part of

<P>This may suffice, for the description of that which in old time was called <HI>Gwyneth</HI> and <HI>Powys.</HI></P>
<P>(15) It now remaineth that we describe the last kingdome of <HI>Wales,</HI> called <HI>Demetia, Deheubarth,</HI>
or the <HI>Talaith</HI> of <HI>Dineuowr,</HI> which although it was the greatest, yet was it not the best, because it

which is the chiefest See in <HI>Wales: Fiscard,</HI> called <HI>Aberwayn:</HI> and <HI>Newport,</HI> named <HI>Tresdreth.</HI></P>
<P>(18) The third part was <HI>Caermarden-shire,</HI> which is a Country accounted the strongest part of
all <HI>South-Wales:</HI> as that which is full of high Mountaines, great Woods, and faire Riuers.</P>
<P>(19) The fourth, called <HI>Morganwe,</HI> now <HI>Glamorgan-shire,</HI> hath on the South, the <HI>Seuerne</HI> Sea,
which diuideth it from <HI>Deuonshire</HI> and <HI>Cornewall:</HI> vpon the West and North-west, <HI>Carmarden-shire:</HI>

the Riuer <HI>Seuerne</HI> vpon the South and South-east.</P>
<P>(21) The last is <HI>Brecknock-shire,</HI> for the most part full of Mountaines, Woods, and Riuers.
This Country is both great and large, being full of faire plaines and vallyes for Corne: it hath
plentie of the thicke Woods, Forrests, and Parkes. It is full also of cleere and deepe Riuers, of which

the South and West shooting farre into the <HI>Irish Seas,</HI> is with the same altoge∣ther

<P>(2) The forme thereof is longer then it is broad; for from S: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> South-point to <HI>Car∣digan-bridge</HI>
in the North, are twentie-sixe miles; the Easterne <HI>Landenie</HI> to S. <HI>Dauids</HI> point in the
West, are twentie miles; the whole in circumference is nintie three miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Aire is passing temperate, by the report of <HI>Giraldus,</HI> who confirmeth his reason from
the site of <HI>Ireland,</HI> against which it butteth, and so neere adioyned, that King <HI>Rufus</HI> thought it possi∣ble
to make a Bridge of his Shippes ouer the Sea, whereby he might passe to <HI>Ireland</HI> on foot.</P>
<P>(4) <HI>Anciently it was possessed by the</HI> Demetia, <HI>further branched into</HI> Cardigan <HI>and</HI> Caermarden-shires,
<HI>as in that County hath beene said, and in the</HI> Saxons Conquest <HI>and</HI> Heptarchte, <HI>by the</HI> Britaines
<HI>forced into those parts for refuge, whither</HI> Henry <HI>the first, and third of the</HI> Normans <HI>King, sent cer∣taine</HI>
Flemings <HI>(whose Country was ouer-whelmed with the breaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Seas) to inhabite
the maritine Tract called</HI> Rosse, <HI>lying West vpon the Riuer</HI> Dougledye. Thess Dutchmen <HI>(saith</HI> Gi∣raldus)
were a strong and stout Nation, inured to Warres, and accustomed to seeke gaine by Clothing, Traf∣fique,
and Tillage, and euer readie for the Field to fight it out: <HI>adding withall, that</HI> they were most loyall
to the English, and most faithfull to the English-men. <HI>Whereupon</HI> Malmesbury <HI>writeth thus:</HI> Many a
time did King <HI>William Rufus</HI> assaile the Welsh, but euer in vaine: which is to be wondred at, considering
<PB REF="144"/>
his other fortunate successe. But <HI>(saith he)</HI> it may be the vneuennesse of the ground, and sharpnesse of the
aire, that maintained their courage, and impeached his valour: which to redresse, King <HI>Henry</HI> his brother
found meanes; for those Flemings, who in regard of his mothers kindred by the fathers side, sorely pestred
and endammaged the English, he sent into Wales, both to purge and disburden his owne Kingdome, and to
quell and keepe backe the courage of his enemies. <HI>These men here seated, deceiued not his expectation,
but so carried themselues in his quarrell, that they seldome communicated with their neighbours,
so that to this day they speake not the Language, and the Country is yet called</HI> Little England beyond
Wales.</P>
<P>(5) The commodities of this Shire are Corne, Cattle, Sea-Fish, and Fowle, and in <HI>Giraldus</HI>
his dayes of saleable Wines, the Hauens being so commodious for Ships arriuage: such is that at
<HI>Tenby,</HI> and <HI>Milford,</HI> an Hauen of such capacitie, that sixteene Creekes, fiue Bayes, and thirteene
Roades, knowne all by seuerall names, are therein contained, where <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Richmond,</HI> of most

vsurping Tyrant.</P>
<P>(6) Neere vnto this is <HI>Pembroke</HI> the Shire-Towne seated, more ancient in shew then it is in
yeares, and more houses without Inhabitants, then I saw in any one Citie thorowout my suruey.
It is walled long-wise, and them but indifferent for repaire, containing in circuit eight hundred and
fourescore pases, hauing three Gates of passage, and at the West end a large Castle, and locked-cau∣sey,
that leads ouer the water to the decayed Priory of <HI>Monton.</HI> The site of this Towne is in the de∣gree
of Longitude, as <HI>Mercator</HI> doth measure, 14. and 55. minutes, and the eleuation from the
North-pole in the degree of Latitude 52.</P>
<P>(7) A Citie as barren is old <HI>Saint Dauids,</HI> neither clad with Woods, nor garnished with Riuers,
nor beautified with Fields, nor adorned vvith Meadowes, but lieth alwayes open both to winde and

whose Monument (as the <HI>Prebends</HI> told me) spared their Church from other defacements,
when all went downe vnder the hammers of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight. About this is a faire wall, and
the Bishops Palace all of free stone, a goodly house I assure you, and of great receit, whose vncoue∣red
tops cause the curious workes in the walles daily to weepe, and them to feare their downefall ere

<P>(8) But <HI>Monton</HI> the <HI>Priorie,</HI> and S. <HI>Dogmels,</HI> places of deuout pietie erected in this Countie,
found not the like fauour, when the commission of their dissolutions came downe against them, and

<P>(2) The forme thereof is in proportion triangle, euery side almost containing a like di∣stance:
for from West to North are twentie miles; from North to South, twenty two miles;
and from South to West are twentie foure miles: the whole in circumference extending to foure∣score

<P>(3) The Aire thereof is sharpe and cold (as most of <HI>Wales</HI> is) for that the snow lyeth and la∣steth
long vnmelted vnder those shadowing high Hils and ouer-hanging Rockes.</P>
<P>(4) The Soile is hungry, though not barren, and that in the East and South the best: the other
parts are rough and churlish, and hardly bettered by painfull labour; so that the riches of the North

<P>Places most worthy of note in this Shire, are as ensueth: The first is <HI>Radnor,</HI> from whom the

along the West of the Towne, whereon a wall of stone was once raised, as by the remaines in many
places appeareth. This <HI>Trench</HI> doth likewise inuerge her West side so farre as the <HI>Riuer,</HI> but after is

the site of that Towne, the Aldermen or chiefe Seniors thereof regarding my paines, with
friendly and courteous entertainments at my departure, no lesse then eight of them, that had beene
Bailiffes of the Towne, came to visit me; where they reported vpon their credit and trials, that
from the top of that hill, in the <HI>Welsh</HI> called <HI>Mounch-denny,</HI> or <HI>Cadier Arthur,</HI> they had oftentimes
cast from them, and downe the North-East Rocke, their Cloakes, Hats, and Staues, which not∣withstanding
would neuer fall, but were with the aire and winde still returned backe, and blowne vp:
neither, said they, will any thing descend from that Cliffe being so cast, vnlesse it be stone or some
metalline substance: affirming the cause to be the Clouds, which are seene to racke much lower

on the South from <HI>Caermarden-shire:</HI> the West is wholly washed with the <HI>Irish Sea.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is horne-like, bowing compasse, long and narrow, and growing
wider still towards the North: so that from <HI>Cardigan,</HI> the Shire-Towne and vttermost point: in the

<HI>Carwen</HI> in the East, to <HI>Aberysthwyth</HI> on her West, the broadest part in the Shire, are onely fifteene:
the whole in circumference is one hundred and three miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Aire is open and somewhat piercing; the soyle is hillie, and <HI>(Wales</HI>-like) vneuen: yet
more plaine and champion towards the Sea, then in the East or North of the Land. For besides
that great and high hill called <HI>Plinil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on,</HI> a continuall range of lesser doth shoote along, yeelding in

But this creature in these parts a long time hath not beene seene, whose roome we may well say the

this policie: He bendeth himselfe backward, and taketh his taile in his mouth, and with all his
strength vnloosing his circle on the sudden (as a lath let goe) mounteth vp before the fall of the
streame; whereupon such water-falles are called the <HI>Salmons leape:</HI> and in these Riuers many such

<HI>Caerdid,</HI> the <HI>English Caerdiffe,</HI> which <HI>Fitz-Haimon</HI> fortified with a Wall and Castle, in the raigne of

thrust out <HI>Iestine</HI> from his lawfull possession. This Towne he made his owne Seat and Court of
Iustice, enioyning his Consorts to giue ayde to this honour, and to hold their portions in vassallage
of him. Strong was the Castle, as by the trust therein reposed may well appeare, where the youngest
brother <HI>Beautlark</HI> kept captiue the eldest <HI>Curthose,</HI> both of them sonnes to the Conquerour, the space
of twentie sixe yeares. This Castle is large, and in good repaire, whence the Towne-wall went
both South and East to the Riuers side, thorow which, foure Gates enter into the foure windes, and
containe in compasse nine hundred and twentie pases; and along the Riuer (a sure defence) vpon
her West side, three hundred more; so that the Towne containeth in circuit twelue hundred and
fourescore pases. But as the <HI>Taue</HI> is a friend to the Towne, in making a Key for arriuage of shipping;
so is she a foe to S. <HI>Maries</HI> Church in the South, with vndermining her foundations, and threatning

<P>(7) More Westward from hence, vpon the Riuer <HI>Ogmore,</HI> and neere vnto <HI>Newton,</HI> in a sandie

where at the flowing and fulnesse of the Sea, can hardly any water be gotten; but at the ebbe and
fall of tyde it walloweth vp amaine. The cause may be, as <HI>Polybius</HI> reports of the like at <HI>Cadys;
Wherein the windie ayre, when it is depriued of his wonted issues, forcibly returneth, shutting and stopping
vp the passages and veines of the Spring, whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> waters are kept in. But contrariwise, when the sur∣face

<P>(2) The forme thereof is Scallop-wise, both long and broad, shooting her North point to

<P>(3) The ayre is very wholesome and pleasant, yet bleake enough, as exposed to the windes on
all sides, and the high hilles, wherewith it is in many places enuitoned, long retaining the congealed
snow. The tops whereof, in the Summer time, are the haruest-mens Almanacks, by the rising of
certaine vapours thereon in the mornings, and foreshew a faire day ensuing.</P>
<P>(4) The soyle is but barren towards the West part: yet the middle, where it lieth flat in a valley,
is most fertile. The East side, when it is once past the valley, findeth Nature to be a very sparing nig∣gard
of her sauours: but next vnto <HI>Dee</HI> it feeleth a more liberall extent of her blessings. The West
part is but here and there inhabited, and mounteth vp more then the other with bare and hungry
hilles: yet the leanesse of the soyle (where the hils settle any thing flatting) hath beene now a
good while begun to be ouercome by the diligent paines and carefull industry of the husbandmen;
<PB REF="161"/>
for they paring away the vpper coat of the earth into certaine Turffes, with a broad kinde of spade,
pile them vp artificially on heapes, and fire them, so as being turned into ashes, and throwne vpon

place, and tooke heart euen of the soyle it selfe: for they continued longest free from the yoke both
of <HI>Roman,</HI> and also of <HI>English</HI> dominion. They were not subdued by the <HI>Romans,</HI> before the dayes
of the Emperor <HI>Domitian</HI> (for then <HI>Iulius Agricola</HI> conquered almost the whole Nation) nor brought
vnder the command of the <HI>English,</HI> before the raigne of King <HI>Edward</HI> the first; but liued a long time
in a lawlesse kinde of libertie, as bearing themselues bold vpon their owne magnanimitie, and the
strength of the Country.</P>
<P>(6) The Mountaines of this County yeeld sufficiency of Neat, Sheepe, and Goats. The Val∣lies
in most places are very plenteous of Corne, especially Eastward on this side, betwixt the Riuers
of <HI>Alen</HI> and <HI>Dee;</HI> but the more Westerly part is heathy, and altogether barren. The heart of the
Shire shewes it selfe beneath the hilles, in a beautifull and pleasant Vale, reaching seauenteene miles
in length from South to North, and fiue miles, or thereabouts, in bredth, and lieth open onely to∣ward
the Sea. It is enuironed on euery side with high hilles, amongst which, the highest is <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llenlly,</HI>
on the top whereof is a warlike Fense with Trench and Rampier, and a little fountaine of cleare wa∣ter.
From these hilles, the Riuer <HI>Cluyd</HI> resorts vnto this Vale, and from the very spring-head (in∣creased
with beckes and brookes) doth part it in twaine, running thorow the midst of it; whereof
in ancient time it was named <HI>Strat Cluyd:</HI> for <HI>Mariam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> maketh mention of a King of the <HI>Strat Cluyd</HI>

<P><PB REF="162"/>
This thing is worthy obseruation, as a matter memorable, both for admiration and antiquitie,
that in the Parish of <HI>Llan-sanan</HI> within this Country, there is a place compasse cut out of the maine
rocke by mans hand, in the side of a stony hill, wherein there be foure and twentie seats to sit in,
some lesse, some bigger, where children and young men, comming to seeke their Cattell, vse to sit,
and to haue their sports. And at this day they commonly call it <HI>Arthurs round Table.</HI></P>
<P>(7) <HI>Henry Lacy</HI> Earle of <HI>Lincolne,</HI> obtaining <HI>Denbigh</HI> by the grant of King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, after
the conuiction and beheading of <HI>Dauid</HI> brother of <HI>Llewellin</HI> for high Treason, was the first that for∣tified
it with a wall about, not large in circuit, but very strong, and on the South-side with a faire
Castle, strengthned with many high Towers. But he gaue it ouer, and left the worke vnfinished,
conceiuing griefe (as a sorrowfull father) that his onely sonne came to vntimely death, and was
drowned in the Well thereof: The fame of this Towne spreads it selfe farre for repute, as being
reckoned the most beautifull place in all <HI>North-Wales:</HI> and it is of no lesse report, for the Castle ad∣iunct
vnto it is impregnable for fortification. And this strange accident happning there in the yeare
1575▪ deserues not to be omitted, being left as a continuall remembrance of Gods mercifull proui∣dence
and preseruation at that time: that whereby reason of great Earth-quakes, many people were
put into great feare, and had much harme done vnto them both within and without their ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, in
the Cities of <HI>Yorke, Worcester, Glocester, Bristow, Hertford,</HI> and in other Countries adiacent, yet in the

hindrance at all either done or receiued. The gouernment of this Towne is managed by two Alder∣men,
and two Bailiffes, who are yearely elected out of twentie fiue burgestes, that are their assistants.
It hath one Recorder, one Towne-Clerke, and two Sergeants at Mace: and by obseruation of the

<HEAD>FLINT-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>FLINT-SHIRE, stretching out in length, broad at one end, and narrow at another, is not
much vnlike in fashion to a wedge, a peece of which is cut off by the meeting of <HI>Cheshire</HI> and
<HI>Denbigh-shire,</HI> South-East in distance some foure miles. It borders East-ward with part of <HI>Che∣shire,</HI>
from whence it is guarded in length with the Riuer <HI>Dee</HI> vnto the North, which parteth
<HI>Worrall</HI> and <HI>Flint-shire,</HI> till you come to a little Iland called <HI>Hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bree.</HI> Northward it is bounded
with the <HI>Virgiuian</HI> Sea: on the West, a little Riuer, called <HI>Cluyd,</HI> parteth her and <HI>Denbigh-shire</HI> asun∣der:
and on the South altogether by <HI>Shrop-shire▪</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Country is nothing mountainous, as other parts of <HI>Wales</HI> are, but rising gently all along
the Riuer of <HI>Dee,</HI> makes a faire shew and prospect of her selfe to euery eye that beholds her, as well
vpon the Riuer, being in most places thereabouts foure or fiue miles broad, as vpon the other side
thereof, being a part of <HI>Cheshire.</HI></P>
<P>(3) The Aire is healthfull and temperate, without any foggie clouds or fennie vapours, sauing
that sometimes there ariseth from the Sea, and the Riuer <HI>Dee,</HI> certaine thicke and smoky-seeming
mists, which neuerthelesse are not found hurtfull to the Inhabitants, who in this part liue long and
healthfully.</P>
<P>(4) The Clime is somewhat colder there then in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> by reason of the Sea, and the Riuer
that engirts the better part of her; by which, the Northerne windes being long carried vpon the
waters, blow the more cold; and that side of the Country vpward, that lieth shoaring vnto the top,
hauing neither shelter nor defence, receiueth them in their full power, and is naturally a Bulwarke
<PB REF="163"/>
from their violence vnto her bordering neighbours, that maketh the snow to lie much longer there
then on the other side of the Riuer.</P>
<P>(5) The Soile bringeth forth plentie both of Corne and Grasse, as also great store of Cattle,
but they be little. To supply which defect, they haue more by much in their numbers then in o∣ther
places where they be bigger. Great store of Fish they take in the Riuer of <HI>Dee,</HI> but little from
the Sea, by reason they haue no Hauens or Creekes for boats. No great store of woods either there
or in any other part of <HI>Wales</HI> are found, it hauing beene a generall plague vnto all the Country euer
since the head-strong rebellions of their Princes and great men against the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> that
(in time) tooke away the principall helpes of their Innouations, by cutting downe their woods,
whereof in this Shire there hath heretofore beene great plentie. Fruits are scarce, but milke, butter,
and cheese plentie, as also store of hony, of the which they make a pleasant wine, in colour like (in
taste not much vnlike) vnto Muskadine, which they call <HI>Mathegli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Yea, and in the dayes of <HI>Giral∣dus
Cambrensis,</HI> neere the place now called <HI>Holy-well,</HI> was a rich Mine of Siluer, in seeking after which,
men pierced and pried into the very bowels of the earth.</P>
<P>(6) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>Ordouices,</HI> a sturdie people against the
<HI>Romans,</HI> but now most kinde and gentle towards the <HI>English,</HI> and indeede make much of all stran∣gers,
except they be crossed, and then they are the contrary.</P>
<P>(7) Places of defence are the Castles of <HI>Flint, Hawarden,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Harden, Treer, Rudland, Mold,
Yowley,</HI> and <HI>Hope:</HI> of which, <HI>Flint</HI> and <HI>Harden</HI> are the two principall. The Castle of <HI>Flint,</HI> famous for
the benefit it receiued from two Kings, and for the refuge and reliefe it gaue vnto the third. It was
founded by <HI>Henry</HI> the second, finished by <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and long after gaue harbour and enter∣tainment
to that noble, but vnfortunate Prince, <HI>Richard</HI> the second, comming out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> being
within her walles a free and absolute King, but no sooner without, but taken prisoner by <HI>Henry Bul∣lingbrooke,</HI>
<PB REF="164"/>
Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> losing at that time his libertie, and not long after his life. This standeth
in the graduation of Latitude 53. 55. minutes, in Longitude 17.</P>
<P>For the Castle of <HI>Hawarden,</HI> no record remaines of the first founder, but that it was held a long
time by the Stewards of the Earles of <HI>Chester.</HI> Howbeit, their resistances did not so generally consist
in the strength of their Castles and Fortifications, as in their Mountaines and Hils, which in times
of danger serued as naturall Bulwarkes and Defences vnto them against the force of enemies. As
was that which standeth in a certaine strait set about with woods, neere vnto the Riuer, <HI>Alen,</HI> called
<HI>Coles-hull,</HI> that is, <HI>Coles-hill,</HI> where the <HI>English,</HI> by reason of their disordered multitude, not ranged
close in good array, lost the field, and were defeated, when King <HI>Henry</HI> the second had made as great
preparation as might be to giue battle vnto the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and the very Kings Standard was forsaken by
<HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Essex,</HI> who was Standard-bearer to the Kings of <HI>England</HI> in right of inheritance.</P>
<P>(8) This Country hath many shallow riuers in it, but none of fame and note, but <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Cluyde.</HI>
Howbeit, there is a Spring not farre from <HI>Rudland Castle,</HI> of great report and antiquitie, which is
termed <HI>Fons Sacer,</HI> in English, <HI>Holy-Well,</HI> and is also commonly called S. <HI>Winefrids Well;</HI> of whom an∣tiquitie
thus reporteth: That <HI>Winefrid</HI> a Christian Virgin, very faire and vertuous, was doated vpon
by a young lustfull Prince or Lord of the Country, who not long able to rule his head-strong af∣fections,
hauing many times in vaine attempted and tryed her chastitie both by rich gifts and large
promises, could not by any meanes obtaine his desires; he therefore (in a place of aduantage) sud∣denly
surprized and rauished her weake (yet resisting) body. After the deed done, the cruell Ty∣rant,
to stop her cries and acclamations, slew her, and cut off her head: out of which place did sud∣denly
arise a Spring that continueth to this day, carrying from the Fountaine such a forcible streame
and current, as the like is not found in Christendome. Ouer the head of the Spring there is built a
Chappell of free stone, with Pillars curiously wrought and engraued, in the Chancell whereof, and
<PB REF="164"/>
glasse window, the picture of the Virgin is drawne, together with the memoriall of her life and death.
To this Fountaine Pilgrims are accustomed to repaire in their zealous, but blind deuotion; and
diuers others resort to bathe in, holding firmely that the water is of much vertue.</P>
<P>There be many red stones in the bottome of this Well, and much greene mosse growing vpon
the sides: the superstition of the people holding that those red spots in the stones were drops of the
Ladies bloud, which all the water in the Spring can neuer wash away; and that the mosse about the
wall was her haire, which though some of it be giuen to euery stranger that comes, yet it neuer wa∣steth.
But howsoeuer this be carried for truth by the tradition of time, the mosse it selfe smels ex∣ceeding
sweet.</P>
<P>There is also hard by <HI>Kilken</HI> (a small village) within this Countie, a little Well of no great note,
that at certaine times riseth and falleth, after the manner of Sea-tydes.</P>
<P>(9) In the South part of this Country, diuided from the rest, is a place (in some written Cop∣pies
of <HI>Antonine,</HI> called <HI>Bouium)</HI> which we now terme <HI>Banchor,</HI> first a Citie, and afterwards a Mona∣stery
of famous memory, and the first that is read of in the world: wherein (as <HI>Beda</HI> saith) were a great
number of Monkes, and them diuided into seauen Companies, euery one hauing his seuerall Ruler
assigned. None of these Companies had lesse then three hundred persons deuoted to prayer, and
to get liuing by their owne labour, for themselues and the poore: although it hath long since beene
vtterly ruinate, so as now there is scarce seene the face and outward shew of a dead Citie or Mona∣stery.
It hath onely the names of two Gates remaining, one standing a mile distant from another,
and betwixt which the Riuer <HI>Dee</HI> now runneth, where are often times found many pieces of <HI>Romane</HI>
Coyne, and other tokens of antiquitie. But of these shall be more mention made in the following
History.</P>
<P>Another like Monastry, but of lesser account, stood in the Vale beneath <HI>Varis</HI> (a little Citie pla∣ced
<PB REF="165"/>
the <HI>Romans</HI> in the confines of this Shire and <HI>Deabigh-shire)</HI> and vpon the Ranke of <HI>Elwy</HI> and

the <HI>Historiographers, Asphensis.</HI> It is more famouse for antiquitie, then for building o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brauery: for
about the yeare 560 <HI>Kentigein</HI> Bishop of <HI>Glas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> being fled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> placed here a Bi∣shops

300. that were vnlearned, gaue themselues to husbandrie, and to worke within the Monastery; the
rest to prayer and meditations. When he returned into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he ordained <HI>Asaph,</HI> a godly and
vpright man, to be gouernous ouer this Monastery, of whom it tooke the name, and is called <HI>Saint
Asaphs.</HI></P>
<P>Another Monastry of great account was at <HI>Basingwarke</HI> in this County, neere vnto which began
that admirable Ditch drawne thence vnto the mouth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by King <HI>Offa,</HI> the Tract whereof I
haue expressed thorow this Shire, and will further speake thereof in the following History.</P>

Market-Towne, and twentie eight Parishes, in which there is a continuall celebration of diuine Ser∣uice.

<HEAD>ANGLESEY.
CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>ANGLESEY was in the time of the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>Mona,</HI> by the <HI>Britaines Mon,</HI> and <HI>Tir-Mon,</HI>
(that is) the Land of <HI>Mon,</HI> of the ancient <HI>English-Saxons Moneg:</HI> And at last, after the <HI>Eng∣lishmen</HI>
had by their sharpe and seuerall assaults brought it vnder their rules, and became
Lords thereof, it was termed <HI>Anglesey,</HI> as one would say, <HI>The Englishmens Iland.</HI></P>
<P>(2) For, an <HI>Iland</HI> it is, albeit it be seuered from the Continent of <HI>Britaine,</HI> but with a small
and narrow streight of the riuer <HI>Menai,</HI> and on all other parts beaten vpon with the surging and trou∣blous
<HI>Irish Sea,</HI> in which it lyeth somewhat square-wise, not much different in length and breadth;
being, where it reacheth out in length, from <HI>Beau-marish</HI> Eastward, to the vtmost Promontory
West-ward, which we call <HI>Holy-head,</HI> twentie miles; and in breadth from <HI>Llanbaderik</HI> North-ward,
to the point of <HI>Menai</HI> South-ward, seauenteene miles; the whole circuit or circumference amounting
towards seauentie miles.</P>
<P>(3) The aire is reasonable gratefull and healthfull, and not generally subiect to diseases, excep∣ting
certaine Agues at some times, which are occasioned by the sogs and misty exhalations, which
arise from the Sea called <HI>Mare Virginium,</HI> with the which this Ile is encompassed.</P>
<P>(4) The Commodities that commend (or rather beautifie) this Country, are in Corne and
Cattle, wherewith it not onely enricheth it selfe exceedingly, but sendeth out great prouision there∣of
to others to supply their defects, and although the ground may seeme dry and stony, or vnplea∣sant
and nothing sightly, wherein for the outward qualitie it resembleth some other parts of <HI>Wales,</HI>
that are not so fruitfull, yet for the inward bounties of nature, it is farre vnlike: for aboue all the
<PB REF="166"/>
Coasts of <HI>Wales</HI> it is most plentifull of Wheat, insomuch as by <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> report, they are
wont to say in <HI>Welsh,</HI> by way of a Prouerbe, <HI>Mon Mam Combry,</HI> which is to say, <HI>Mon</HI> is the mother
of <HI>Wales;</HI> for that when other Countries haruest failes round about, or their prouision is exhaust and
drawne dry, this alone, like a prouident and full-brested mother, is able to sustaine the rest Where∣unto
Nature most prouidently hath added another benefit seruiceable and necessary to the former,
in that the Country produceth also those kinde of stones which are called <HI>Mol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res,</HI> is of all other
fittest to make <HI>Mill-stones</HI> or <HI>Grind-stones.</HI> In some places also it yeeldeth an earth of <HI>Alumino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> qua∣litie,
out of which some not long since began to make <HI>Alom</HI> and <HI>Coperose,</HI> who (like vnflesht Souldi∣ers)
gaue ouer their enterprise without further hope, because at first they saw it not answere their
ouer-hastie expectations.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ices,</HI> mentioned before in the pre∣cedent
Prouinces of <HI>Denbigh-shire, Flint-shire,</HI> and <HI>Carnaruon-shire.</HI> And this very Iland was that
ancient, and so much enobled seate of the <HI>British Druyds,</HI> who so amated the Army of <HI>Romane</HI> in∣uaders,
as <HI>Tacitus</HI> reports, and as else-where we haue related in the sixt Booke and seauenth Chapter
of our ensuing History.</P>
<P>(6) This Nation was attempted first by <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>linus Suetonius</HI> in the raigne of <HI>Nero,</HI> but brought
vnder the <HI>Romane</HI> Empire by <HI>Iulius Agricola.</HI> When the Empire of the <HI>Romanes</HI> in <HI>Britaine</HI> began to
decline and goe downeward, some out of <HI>Ireland</HI> entred into this Isle by stealth, and nestled them∣selues
there, as may be gathered by certaine mounts of earth entrenched about, and yet to be seene,
which they call the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh mens Cottages:</HI> as also by a place named of the <HI>Irish-men, yn Hieriey Gwidid,</HI>
who did there (as is recorded) put the <HI>Britaines</HI> to flight, vnder the leading of <HI>Sinigus.</HI> The <HI>Norwe∣gians</HI>
also were often infestuous to this Iland; but King <HI>Ethelreds</HI> Fleet, hauing in the yeare 1000.
scowred the Seas round about this Isle, far exceeded all both <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Norwegian</HI> depopulations, for
they wasted the Country in all hostile manner.</P>

Earle of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> through with an Arrow, and departed after he had ransacked the Iland. It was
afterwards grieuously infested by the <HI>Englishmen,</HI> who neuer gaue ouer from time to time to inuade
it, vntill in the raigne of King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, it was wholly brought vnder his subiection.</P>
<P>(8) The principall Towne in this Isle is <HI>Beaumarish,</HI> which the said King <HI>Edward</HI> the first built
in the East side thereof, and for the faire situation, though in a Morish place, gaue it the name which
it now beareth, whereas in times past it was called <HI>Bonouer;</HI> which he also fortified with a goodly
Castle.</P>
<P>(9) The Maior is the chiefest Magistrate of the Towno, who is yearely chosen, and hath the
assistance and helpe of two Bailiffes, two Sergeants at Mace, and one Towne-Clerke: by whose
carefull diligence the affaires of this Towne are orderly managed and commanded: whose Latitude
is 54. and Longitude 15. 45. minutes.</P>
<P>(10) Not far from hence is <HI>Lhaanuais,</HI> in times past a faire religious house of the <HI>Friars Minors,</HI>
which although it be now in a manner raced out of memory, yet antiquitie maketh mention that it
hath beene of great regard among the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> who haue shewed themselues very bounti∣full
Patrons vnto that Couent, both in respect of the sanctimonious life of such as conuersed there,
as also because there the bodies of very eminent persons, as the daughter of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> the sonne of
a King of the <HI>Danes,</HI> as likewise of many great Lords, Knights, and Squires, were enterred, that were
slaine in the warres against the <HI>Welsh,</HI> in the time of many illustrious Kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CAERNARVON-SHIRE.
CHAPTER XIIII.</HEAD>
<P>CAERNARVON-SHIRE, in <HI>Welsh, Sire Caer-ar-von,</HI> so called because it is iust ouer a∣gainst
<HI>Anglesey,</HI> (which the <HI>Britaines</HI> call <HI>Mon,)</HI> and in composition was termed also <HI>Snow∣den-Forrest,</HI>
before <HI>Wales</HI> was laid into Shires; the North-side whereof and the West butteth
vpon the <HI>Irish Sea,</HI> the South-side is inclosed with <HI>Merioneth,</HI> and the East with <HI>Denbigh-shires,</HI>
from which it is seuered by the Riuer <HI>Conwey.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is much like a wedge, long and narrow toward the South, and growing
still wider towards the North: so that from <HI>Penenkel-point</HI> South-ward, to <HI>Orms-head-point</HI> North∣ward,
are fortie miles, from the Riuer <HI>Conwey</HI> Eastward, to the Riuer <HI>Llenoy</HI> Westward, miles twen∣tie:
and the whole circumference one hundred and ten miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Aire is sharpe and piercing, by reason that the Country hath not naturall prouision to
ensconce her selfe against the extremitie of winds and weather: but especially as may be thought,
through the continuance of the Snow on the hils, which also exclude the Suns aspect and warmth.</P>
<P>(4) The soile cannot be much commended for the fertilitie, except those parts of the Sea-coasts,
which lye on the West towards <HI>Ireland:</HI> but for the heart of this Shire, it is altogether mountainous,
as if Nature had a purpose here, by rearing vp these craggy hils so thicke together, strongly to com∣pact
the ioynts of this our Iland, and to frame the Inland part thereof for a fit place of refuge to the
<HI>Britaines,</HI> against those times of aduersitie which afterward did fall vpon them; for no Army though
neuer so strongly, or scarce any Trauellers, though neuer so lightly appointed, can finde passage a∣mong
those so many rough and hard Rockes, so many Vales and Pooles here and there, crossing

<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>Ordouices,</HI> of whom we haue sufficiently
spoken in the description of the former Prouinces; neither need I insist either vpon the pleasures or
profits that this Country yeeldeth, by reason of the great affinity it hath both of Climate and Com∣modities
with <HI>Denbigh-shire</HI> and <HI>Flint-shire</HI> before mentioned But this beyond the other in some pla∣ces
breeds certaine <HI>Shel-fishes,</HI> which being conceiued by an heauenly dew bring forth Pearles, in
ancient times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of then now they are.</P>
<P>(6) Touching places of note, that Citie is very ancient which the Emperour <HI>Antonine</HI> calleth
<HI>Segontium,</HI> taking name of a Riuer running by, which at this day is called <HI>Seront:</HI> some reliques of
the walls whereof doe yet appeare, neere vnto a little Church consecrated to the honour of <HI>Saint
Publicius.</HI> This Citie <HI>Ninius</HI> calleth <HI>Caer Custenith,</HI> which some interpret the Citie of <HI>Constantine.</HI>
Indeed <HI>Mathew Westminster</HI> saith (how true I know not) that <HI>Anno</HI> 1283. here was found the body
of <HI>Constantius</HI> (Father to great <HI>Constantine)</HI> which King <HI>Edward</HI> the first caused to be sumptuously
bestowed in the Church of the new Citie, which he raised out of the ruines of the old, and is now
called <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>naruon,</HI> which giueth name to this whole Shire. The Towne it selfe yeeldeth a most
<PB REF="170"/>
excellent prospect towards the Sea, and is incompassed (in a manner) round with the wals of the
Castle: so as we may say, it is a Citie within a Castle, which taketh vp the whole West-side of it:
and great pitie it is, that so famous a worke should not be perpetuous, or euer become the ruine of
time, which is much feared, for the mercilesse vnderminings of the Sea, that with her daily and for∣cible
irruptions neuer ceaseth to wash away the foundations of the Key. The people of this Towne
are well approued for courte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie, and also Ciuill gouernment, which is administred by the Constable
of the Castle (who is euer Maior by Patent) hauing the assistance of one <HI>Alderman,</HI> two <HI>Bailiffes,</HI>
two <HI>Sergeants</HI> at <HI>Mace,</HI> and one <HI>Towne-Clerke.</HI> The Townesmen doe not a little glory that King
<HI>Edward</HI> the second was borne there, in a Tower of the Castle called <HI>Eagle-Tower,</HI> and surnamed
of <HI>Caer-nar-uon,</HI> he being the first Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> line. The site of this Towne accor∣ding
to Mathematicall obseruation is in the degree of Longitude 15. and 50. scruples from the first
West-point, and the Pole eleuated in Latitude 53. and 50.</P>
<P><HI>Bangor</HI> the Bishops See, though it be now but a small Towne, yet it was in time past so large,
that for the greatnesse thereof it was called <HI>Banchor Vaur,</HI> that is, <HI>Great Banchor;</HI> which <HI>Hugh</HI> Earle
of <HI>Chester</HI> fortified with a Castle: But it hath beene long since vtterly ruinated and laid leuell with
the ground, in so much as there is not any footing to be found, or other monuments left thereof, al∣though
they haue beene sought with all diligent enquiry. This Bishops See hath within the Dioces
ninetie six Parishes. But the ancient Church which was consecrated vnto <HI>Daniel,</HI> sometime Bishop
thereof, was defaced and set on fire by that notorious Rebell <HI>Owen Glendowerdwy,</HI> who had a pur∣pose
also to destroy all the Cities of <HI>Wales,</HI> for that they stood for the King of <HI>England.</HI> And though
the same Church was since repaired about the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the seauenth, yet hath it scarce
recouered the resemblance of her former dignitie.</P>

The Riuer <HI>Conwey</HI> (which limitteth this Shire on the East-side) is in <HI>Ptolemy</HI> by corruption or
ignorance of Transcribers called <HI>Toisonius,</HI> in stead of <HI>Cononius,</HI> whence <HI>Canonium</HI> (a Towne men∣tioned

a couert remembrance thereof in the new name of a poore Village, standing among the rubbish
thereof, called <HI>Caer-hean,</HI> (that is) The ancient Citie: Out of the spoyle whereof King <HI>Edward</HI>
the first, built a new Towne at the Riuers mouth, termed thereupon <HI>Aber-Conwey:</HI> (that is) the
mouth of <HI>Conwey,</HI> which being formerly fortified by <HI>Hugh</HI> of <HI>Chester,</HI> and strongly situate and fenced
both with wals &amp; a faire Castle by the Riuers side, deserues rather the name of a Citie then a Towne,
if it were more populous and traffiqued with Inhabitants Neither must I here forget <HI>Newin,</HI> though
but a small Market-Towne, for that it pleased the English Nobles <HI>Anno</HI> 1284 to honour it and the
memory of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> with triumphant celebritie, after they had subdued the rebellious Ring∣leaders
of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>(7) Other matters of memorable note this Country affordeth not much, vnlesse perhaps this;
That iust ouer against the Riuer <HI>Conwey,</HI> where it iflueth into the Sea, there sometimes stood an anci∣ent
Citie named <HI>Diganwey,</HI> which many yeares agoe was consumed by lightning, and so made vtter∣ly
desolate, as many other monuments haue beene, of ancient and worthy memory. As likewise
that in the Poole <HI>Lin-Peris,</HI> there is a kinde of Fish called there <HI>Torco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> hauing a red belly, no where

<HEAD>SCOTLANDS GENERALL DESCRIPTION.
CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>SCOTLAND, the second Kingdome of <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> and the North part of the Iland,
hath on the East the <HI>Germane Ocean,</HI> on the North, the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> and <HI>Deucalidon Sea,</HI> the West
affronted with <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the South hath the Riuer <HI>Tweed,</HI> the <HI>Cheuiot Hils,</HI> and the adiacent
Tract, reaching to the <HI>Sulway</HI> Sands, whereby it is separated from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Kingdome is faire and spacious, and from these South-borders spreadeth it selfe
wide into the East and West, till againe it contracts it selfe narrower vnto the Northerne Promon∣tories:
furnished with all things befitting a famous Kingdome; both for Ayre and Soyle, Riuers,
Woods, Mountaines, Fish, Fowle, and Cattle, and Corne so plenteous, that it supplyeth therewith
other Countryes in their want. The people thereof are of good feature, strong of body, and of cou∣ragious
minde, and in warres so venturous, that scarce any seruice of note hath beene performed,
but that they were with the first and last in the field. Their Nobilitie and Gentry are very studious
of learning, and all ciuill knowledge; for which end they not onely frequent the three Vniuersities
of their owne Kingdome (S. <HI>Andrewes, Glasco,</HI> and <HI>Edenbrough,</HI> the Nurseries of Pietie, and Man∣sions
of the sacred <HI>Muses)</HI> but also much addict themselues to trauell into forraine Countries.</P>
<P>(3) The Counties contained in this Kingdome are many, and euery where bestrewed with Ci∣ties,
Towne, and Borrowes, as is that of <HI>England:</HI> and, as <HI>England,</HI> I entended to describe it, had I
not beene happily preuented by a learned Gentleman of that Nation, who hath most exactly be∣gun,

and gone through the greatest difficulties thereof; to build vpon whose foundations, I hold it
iniurious: and am so farre from any ambition to preuent his noble purposes, that I heartily with all
happie furtherances thereto, with a longing desire to see, by his industrious labours, another <HI>Scene</HI>
added to the perfecting of the <HI>Theatre of Britaines glory.</HI></P>
<P>(4) Yet, in the meane while, lest I should seeme too difectiue in my intendments, let me with∣out
offence (in this third, though short Booke) giue onely a generall view of that Kingdome, vpon
obseruations from others; which to accomplish by mine owne suruey (if others should hap to faile,
and my crazy-aged-body will giue leaue) is my chiefe desire; knowing the Iland furnished with
many worthy remembrances, appertaining both vnto them and vs, whom God now hath set vnder
one Crowne: and the rather, for that their more Southerne people are from the same Originall
with vs the <HI>English,</HI> being both alike the <HI>Saxon</HI> branches: as also, that the <HI>Picts</HI> anciently inhabiting
part of that Kingdome, were the inborne <HI>Britaines,</HI> and such as thither fled to auoid the <HI>Romane</HI> serui∣tude:
whose names began first to be distinguished vnder <HI>Dioclesian</HI> the Emperour, when they were
termed <HI>Picts</HI> for painting their bodies, like the <HI>Britaines,</HI> as such <HI>Flauius Vigetius:</HI> which is more
strengthened, for that the Northerne <HI>Britaines</HI> conuerted by Saint <HI>Columb,</HI> are called <HI>Britaine
Picts.</HI></P>
<P>(5) But the <HI>Highland-men</HI> (the naturall <HI>Scot</HI> indeed) are supposed to descend from the <HI>Scythi∣ans,</HI>
who with the <HI>Getes</HI> infesting <HI>Ireland,</HI> left both their Issue there, and their manners, apparant in
the <HI>Wild-Irish</HI> euen to this day: And from <HI>Scithae</HI> (as is thought) the name of <HI>Scot</HI> grew; for so the
<HI>Netherlanders</HI> by <HI>Scutten</HI> expresse indifferently the <HI>Scythian</HI> or <HI>Scot:</HI> so <HI>Gildas</HI> calleth the <HI>Irish-Bri∣taines,
Scythians:</HI> so King <HI>Elfeed</HI> in translating the Historie of <HI>Orosius,</HI> turneth <HI>Scotos</HI> into <HI>Scyttan:</HI>
and so saith <HI>Walsingham,</HI> from one and the same originall, <HI>Scythae, Scytici, Scotae, Scotici,</HI> take their
names, as from <HI>Getae, Getici, Gothi, Gothici</HI> haue done.

(6) Their manner were alike, saith <HI>Diodorus, Siculus,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> and their garments not much
different, as by <HI>Sidonius Apollinaris</HI> may be gathered, where he seemeth rather to describe the mo∣derne
<HI>Wild-Irish,</HI> then the antike <HI>Gete.</HI> Notwithstanding this Nations Originall by some hath beene
deriued from <HI>Scota,</HI> the supposed Daughter of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> King <HI>Pharoah,</HI> that nourished <HI>Moses,</HI> af∣terwards
married vnto <HI>Gaithelus,</HI> the son of <HI>Cecrops,</HI> (Founder of <HI>Athens)</HI> who first seating in <HI>Spaine,</HI>
passed thence into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and lastly into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where his Wife <HI>Scota</HI> gaue <HI>Name</HI> to the <HI>Nation;</HI>

<HI>Scythians,</HI> were the builders (as he saith) of the Citie <HI>Susanna</HI> in <HI>Spaine▪</HI> And how from <HI>Spaine</HI> they
possessed themselues of <HI>Ireland,</HI> (at the time when the Kingdome of <HI>Iulah</HI> flourished,) <HI>Ninius</HI> the
Disciple of <HI>Eluodugus</HI> doth tell, and their owne Histories of <HI>Nemethus</HI> and <HI>Delas,</HI> besides <HI>Cisnerus</HI> and
others, doe shew; who were first knowne by the name of <HI>Scots,</HI> as is gathered out of <HI>Prophyry</HI> (alled∣ged
by S. <HI>Ierome)</HI> in the raigne of <HI>Aurelianus</HI> the Emperour. <HI>Gildas</HI> calleth them the <HI>Irish-Spoilers:
Giraldus, A Scotish Nation, descended from Ireland:</HI> which in regard of them by <HI>Eginbardus</HI> is termed
<HI>The Ile of Scots:</HI> by <HI>Beda, The Ile inhabited by the Scots;</HI> and by other Historians, <HI>Scotland the great;</HI>
as their seate in <HI>Britaine</HI> was called <HI>Scotland the lesse.</HI></P>
<P>(8) These, when the <HI>Romane Empire</HI> was farre in the wane, burst into <HI>Britaine</HI> vnder <HI>Reuda</HI> their
Captaine, who entring amitie with the <HI>Picts,</HI> possessed the North part of the Iland, and assisted them
against the <HI>Britaines,</HI> then ready to fall, when the <HI>Romanes</HI> were gone. But these afterward entertaining
dissentions amongst themselues, put the hazard of their estates on the tryall and chance of one dayes
battle, fought betwixt them in the yeare of Saluation, 740. Wherein the <HI>Picts</HI> not onely lost their

<P>Amongst the things worthy of note of Antiquitie in this Kingdome, most memorable was that
Fortification drawne from <HI>Abercorne</HI> vpon the <HI>Frith</HI> of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> vnto <HI>Aleluya,</HI> how <HI>Dunbritton,</HI>
opening vpon the West Sea, where <HI>Iulius Agricola</HI> set the limit of the <HI>Romane</HI> Empire; past which,
saith <HI>Tacitus,</HI> there was no other bounds of <HI>Britaine</HI> to be sought for: and that here the second Le∣gion
<HI>Augusta,</HI> and the 20. Legion <HI>Victrix,</HI> built a part of the Wall, certaine Inscriptions there dig∣ged
vp, and reserued at <HI>Dunloyr</HI> and <HI>Cader,</HI> doe witnesse: as also an ancient coped monument of an
high and round compasse, which, as some thinke, was a Temple consecrated vnto the God <HI>Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>:</HI>
others, a <HI>Trophey</HI> raised by <HI>Carausius,</HI> who fortified this Wall with seauen Castles, as <HI>Ninius</HI> doth
declare.</P>
<P>(12) At this place began the great and darke Wood <HI>Caled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia,</HI> famous for the wilde white Buls
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="176"/>

<PB REF="177"/>
that therein were bred whose Manes were Lion like, thicke and cuuled, of nature fierce and cruell,
and so hatefull to mankinde, that they abhorred whatsoeuer was by them handled or breathed vpon:
these Woods stretched farre and wide with many turnings, darke shades, and dreadfull dens, and so
famous in the <HI>Romane</HI> Writers, that they often vsed that name for all <HI>Britaine;</HI> whose Inhabitants
were the last in this Iland, that yeelded their neckes to the yoake of subiection, is shall appeare in our
following Story.</P>
<P>(13) <HI>Ninian</HI> a <HI>Britaine</HI> is recorded to haue conuerted the <HI>South-Ficts</HI> vnto the Faith of Christ
in the raigne of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the younger, and the Church in <HI>Galloway</HI> bearing his name doth witnes
it: so likewise in the same age <HI>Palladius</HI> sent from Pope <HI>Coelestine,</HI> became an Apostle vnto the <HI>Scots,</HI>
whose reliques lay enshrined at <HI>Fordo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in <HI>Mernis,</HI> as was verily supposed: but that Christianitie had
beene formerly planted in this vttermost Prouince, is testified by <HI>Tertuilian,</HI> in saying the <HI>Britaines</HI>
had embraced the faith farther then the <HI>Romans</HI> had power to follow or persecute them, whereupon
<HI>Peter</HI> Monke of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Spaine,</HI> concludeth their conuersion to be more ancient then the Southerne
<HI>Britaines.</HI></P>
<P>(14) But touching things obseruable for the present, surely admirable is the report of the plenty
of Cattle, Fish, and Fowle there abiding: their Neat but little, yet many in number: Fish so plenti∣full
that men in some places (for delight) on horse-backe hunt <HI>Salmons</HI> with Speares: and a certaine
Fowle, which some call <HI>Soland-Geese,</HI> spreading so thicke in the ayre, that they euen darken the Suns
light; of whose flesh, feathers and oyle, the Inhabitants in some parts make great vse and gaine; yea,
and euen of fishes brought by them, abundant prouision for diet, as also of the stickes (brought to
make their nests) plentifull prouision for fuell.</P>
<P>(15) With these, as of wonders I might speake of the natures of those two famous Loughes,
<HI>Lomund</HI> and <HI>Nessa,</HI> the latter whereof neuer freezeth in Winter, though neuer so extreame, and the

<PB REF="178"/>
waters of the other most raging in the fairest and calmest weather, wherein also floateth an Iland
that remoueth from place to place, as the winde forceth her spongeous and vnfastned body. In <HI>Bu∣quhan</HI>
vpon the banket of <HI>Ratra</HI> is a Well, whose trickling drops turne (in Piramidy-wise) into hard
stone, and another neere <HI>Edenbrough</HI> that floateth with <HI>Bitumen.</HI> In <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Done,</HI> besides the admi∣red
plenty of <HI>Salmons,</HI> is found a Shell-fish, called the <HI>Horse-mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ll,</HI> wherein Pearles are engaendred,
most precious for Physicke, and some of them so Orient, that they giue not place to the choisest.</P>
<P>(16) No lesse strange then any the fore-mentioned waters, but more lamentable is the remem∣brance
of the great in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndation, happing by the sodaine rising of <HI>Tay.</HI> which bare away the Walles
and Towne of <HI>Berth,</HI> and with it the Cradle and yong sonne of King <HI>William</HI> into the Sea, wherein the
Royall Insant with many others perished, the King and his Courtiers hardly escaping the danger
with life. The ruine of this Towne raised another more famous, and more commodiously seated,
euen <HI>Perth,</HI> since called Saint <HI>Iohns-Towne.</HI></P>
<P>(17) Ilands and Ilets yeelding both beautie and subiection to this <HI>Scotish</HI> Kingdome, are the
<HI>Westerne,</HI> the <HI>Orknayes,</HI> and the <HI>Shetlands,</HI> reckoned to be aboue three hundred in number; the Inha∣bitants
for the most part vsing the frugalitie of the ancient <HI>Scot.</HI></P>
<P>(18) The <HI>Westerne</HI> lying scattered in the <HI>Deucalidoman</HI> Sea, were anciently ruled by a King of
their owne, whose maintenance was out of their common Coffers, and the Regall Authoritie ne∣uer
continued in line all succession, for (to preuent that) their Kings were not permitted to haue
wiues of their owne, but might by their Lawes accompany with other mens: as the like Law was in
the other parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the Virginitie of all new wiues, should be the Landlords prey, till
King <HI>Malcolme</HI> enacted, that halfe a marke should be paid for redemption. The residence of those
fore-mentioned Kings, was chiefly in <HI>Ila, Bunals,</HI> and <HI>Iona,</HI> now <HI>Columbkill,</HI> where (as <HI>Donald Munr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
who trauelled through these Ilands reporteth) are three Tombes, hauing the seuerall Inscriptions
of the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and of <HI>Norway.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="178"/>
(19) Among these <HI>Westerne</HI> Ilands, the <HI>Hebrides, Skie, Mula, Ila,</HI> and <HI>Arran,</HI> are the greatest:
All of them plentifull of Corne, Woods, Salmons and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errings, as others of Conies Deere, Hor∣ses,
and Sheepe, where in some they are wilde, and in others without any owners; but the people vn∣ciuill,
and lacking Religion, they rather liue rudely in state of necessitie, then as Lords of these por∣tions
which God hath allotted them; and with a sufferable ease, ignorant of ambition, enioy those
contentments, which some others (though they no great summe) doe more laboriously attaine vn∣to
by the precepts of Philosopie: for, feeding themselues with competencie without any excesse,
they returne all the ouer-plus vnto their Lords, as doe the Inhabitants of <HI>Hirta</HI> and <HI>Rona;</HI> but alas,
Religion not knowne among them, these penurious vertues are rather the curses of <HI>Cham,</HI> then the
followings of Christ, who forbids vs <HI>to be too carefull for the morrow.</HI></P>
<P>(20) The Iles of <HI>Orkenay</HI> vpon the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> lying in a most raging and tempestuous
Sea, are about three and thirtie in number, whereof thirteene are inhabited, and the other repleni∣shed
with Cattle: in these are no venomous Serpents, nor other vgly vermin; the aire sharpe and
healthfull, and the soile apt to beare onely Oats and Barley, but not a sticke of wood: among these,
<HI>Pomonia</HI> is the greatest, accounted and called the Maine-land, affording sixe Minerals of Lead and
Tinne, and in her chiefe Towne a Bishops See: wherein are seated twelue Parish-Churches, one of
them very magnificent for so remote a Country.</P>
<P>(21) Of all the <HI>Romanes, Iulius Agricola</HI> first discouered the <HI>Orkenays;</HI> yea, and subdued them,
if we will beleeue <HI>Tacitus:</HI> but <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> that wrote thirtie yeares before him, doth mention
them, and <HI>Iuuenal</HI> in <HI>Hadrians</HI> time after him, tels vs the <HI>Romanes</HI> had won them; and lastly, <HI>Claudian</HI>
nameth <HI>Saxons</HI> that were slaine in them and so doth <HI>Ninius</HI> name <HI>Octha</HI> and <HI>Ebissus, Saxon</HI> Com∣manders,
who in their rouing Pinnaces wasted the <HI>Orknays.</HI> These Ilands <HI>Donald Bane</HI> the vsurper of
the <HI>Scotish</HI> Crowne, gaue to the King of <HI>Norway</HI> for his assistance, and by the <HI>Norwegians</HI> were they

held the space of an hundred and sixtie yeares, vntill that <HI>Alexander</HI> the third King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with
sword and composition got them from <HI>Magnus</HI> the fourth, King of <HI>Norway,</HI> which afterward King
<HI>Haquin</HI> confirmed vnto King <HI>Robert Bruce:</HI> but lastly, <HI>Christian</HI> the first, King of <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Den∣marke,</HI>
vtterly renounced all his right to those Ilands, when he gaue his daughter in marriage vnto
King <HI>Iames</HI> the third, which deed was further ratified by the Pope, who openeth the way to the pos∣session
of Kingdomes with his owne key.</P>
<P>(22) More North, and further then this Chart could well expresse, lie the Isles of <HI>Shetland,</HI> of
some thought to be <HI>Thule,</HI> and by the Commenter vpon <HI>Horace,</HI> the <HI>Fortunate Iland,</HI> where as <HI>Tzetz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
fabuleth, the soules of good men are ferryed into those <HI>Elizia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> fields that euer grow greene, and
whence <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> could hardly be drawne, as <HI>Muretus</HI> hath written: but their fictions intended
onely that the vertuous soules of the dead passed the vttermost bounds of earthly abode, and attai∣ned
to an ouer-pleasing repose, and euer-flourishing happinesse; which whether they horrowed from
the description of Paradise, (taken both for a faire Garden and the soules happy rest) I cannot de∣fine;
but sure they would not haue made those fields alwayes greene, if they had seene how they lye
euer couered with Ice and Snow, being in the 63. degree of Latitude, as <HI>Ptolemie</HI> hath placed it,
where (for the most part) is a continuall Winter: but for proofe that this was the <HI>Thule,</HI> besides
<HI>Ptolemies</HI> Positure, <HI>Saxo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grammaticus</HI> betwixt <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> hath placed it; and <HI>Solin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> two

<HEAD>IRELAND DESCRIBED.
CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THe Traditions of time haue deliuered vnto vs diuers names, whereby this famous Iland is
recorded to haue beene called: yet none of more faire probabilitie, then that of <HI>Orpheus, A∣ristotle</HI>
and <HI>Claudian,</HI> by whom it is named <HI>Ierna:</HI> by <HI>Iuuenal</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> called <HI>Iuuerna:</HI> by <HI>Dio∣dorus
Siculus, Iris:</HI> by <HI>Martian</HI> of <HI>Heraclea, Ioyepnia:</HI> by <HI>Eustachius, Oyernia,</HI> and <HI>Bernia</HI> by
the natiue Inhabitants, <HI>Eryn:</HI> by the <HI>Britaines, Yuerdon:</HI> the <HI>Welsh-Bards</HI> in their Ballads,
<HI>Tiruolas Totidanan,</HI> and <HI>Banno:</HI> and by the <HI>English, Ireland.</HI> But from whence these diuersities were de∣riued,
arise many opinions. Doubtlesse it is, that <HI>Hibernia, Iuuerna,</HI> and <HI>Ouernia,</HI> came from <HI>Ierna,</HI>
spoken of by <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pheus</HI> and <HI>Aristotle;</HI> and the same <HI>Ierna,</HI> as also <HI>Iris, Iuerdhon,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> from <HI>Erin,</HI>
the terme that the Inhabitants now vse. From this <HI>Erin</HI> therefore (a word proper to the Nation)
the originall is most likely to be deduced.</P>
<P>(2) Some deriue <HI>Hiber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a</HI> from <HI>Hiberno tempore,</HI> that is, from the winter season; some from <HI>Hi∣berus</HI>
a <HI>Spaniard;</HI> some from a Duke named <HI>Irnalph;</HI> some againe from the ancient Riuer <HI>Iberus,</HI> and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from <HI>Hiere,</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> word, which signifieth the west, or a westerne coast, whence <HI>Erin</HI> may also
seeme to setch the deriuation: for it lieth furthest Westward of any Region in all <HI>Europe.</HI> As also for
that the Riuer running in the most remote west-part of this Iland, is in <HI>Ptolemy</HI> called <HI>Iernus:</HI> like as
the furthest Westerne Promontory in <HI>Spaine,</HI> from whence our <HI>Irish</HI> men came, is by <HI>Strabo</HI> called
<PB REF="180"/>
<HI>Ierne,</HI> and the Riuer next vnto it, by <HI>Mela, Ierna:</HI> yea, and <HI>Spaine</HI> it selfe, for the Westerne situation,
is called <HI>Hesperia:</HI> the West-Cape of <HI>Africke, Hesperium;</HI> and in <HI>Germany, Westrich</HI> and <HI>Westphale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
from their position haue their names. <HI>Postelius</HI> (a man that rather followed his owne fancy, then
the iudgement of others) fetcheth the originall of <HI>Ireland</HI> from the <HI>Hebrewes,</HI> as if <HI>Irin</HI> should be as
much as <HI>Iurin,</HI> that is, the <HI>Iewes</HI> land: which opinion I hold no better then those that would haue it
from the Winter-like stormes, although vpon euery winde the aire is cold there.</P>
<P>(3) <HI>Festus Auienus,</HI> in that little booke which he entituled <HI>Ora maritima</HI> calleth <HI>Ireland, Sacram
Insulam,</HI> that is, the holy Iland: to which opinion the people are soone drawne, by reason of the
many Saints that the Iland is said to produce, and the blessed soile that affords no venomous crea∣tures
to retaine life. It is thought that <HI>Plutarch</HI> meant <HI>Ireland</HI> by his <HI>Ogygia,</HI> for her great antiquitie;
and of latter times by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sidore</HI> and <HI>Bede</HI> it was called <HI>Scots</HI> of those <HI>Scots</HI> that inhabited it: and that
thence the name of <HI>Scotland,</HI> together with the <HI>Scots</HI> themselues, came into <HI>Britaine.</HI></P>
<P>(4) For largenesse and circuit, in times past, this Iland challenged the third place in ranke of
all the Iles of the then knowne world: for thus haue Geographers left vs, that the <HI>Indian Taproba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
for greatnesse was the first, the Ile of <HI>Britaine</HI> the next, and this of <HI>Ireland</HI> the third: and for that cause
doth <HI>Ptolemy</HI> call it the little <HI>Britaine.</HI> But how soeuer <HI>Strabo</HI> hath extended the bredth, as broad as
the length, and others haue formed it in shape like an egge, yet latter dimensions haue found it farre
otherwise, twice longer then broad, and may be compared to the forelegge of a Beare, if the <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile</HI>
breed no offence. Whose East-side hath on it that tempestuous Sea that cutteth her channell betwixt
<HI>England</HI> and this <HI>Ireland:</HI> the West is washed with the Westerne Ocean; the North with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Caledonian;</HI> and the South with the <HI>Vergiuian Sea.</HI></P>
<P>(5) The aire of this Iland is delectable and wholesome, though neither so cleere nor sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
<PB REF="181"/>
of <HI>England,</HI> which (as <HI>Mela</HI> saith) is nothing fauourable for the ripening of Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: but so
gratefull to the ground, that it causeth grasse to grow abund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntly, not onely fresh and long, but
withall very sweet for all Cattle, and in Winter is more subiect to winde then snow: and that I may
vse the words of <HI>Giraldus, It is of all Countries most temperate, neither forcing the Inhabitants to seeke
shade from the frying heat of Cancer, nor the chilling cold of Capricorne to driue them to the fire:</HI> but at all
seasons most milde, betwixt a sufferable cold, and gentle warme heat.</P>
<P>(6) The soile (saith <HI>Cambrensis)</HI> is vneuen, wooddy, wilde, waterish and boggy, so full of Loghs
and Meeres, that great ponds of water are found vpon the high Mountaines. These indeed make the
places somewhat dangerous vnto all new commers, by breeding of rheums dyssenteries and fluxes,
whose vsuall remedie is <HI>Vskebah,</HI> a wholesome <HI>Aqua vita,</HI> that drieth more, and enflameth lesse,
then many other hot confections.</P>
<P>(7) The Commodities of this Kingdome chiefly consist in Cattle, whose feed is so sweet and so
ranke, that they will soone graze to a surfet, if they may be suffered to feed as they will. Their sheepe
are many, but beare not the best wooll, which twice are shorne within one yeare. Of these they make
Mantles, Caddowes, and Couerle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, vented from thence into forraine Countries. Their Hobbies
likewise are of great esteeme, and are answerable to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ennets of <HI>Spaine.</HI> Bees are there in such a∣bundance,
that hony is found in holes of old trees, and in rests of the rockes. No annoyance of hurt∣full
Snake or venomous creatures; and to speake all in a word, nothing wanting for profit or plea∣sure:
for so much doth <HI>Giraldus</HI> affirme, in saying, that <HI>Nature had cast into this Westerne Kingdome of
Zephyrus a more gracious eye then was ordinary.</HI></P>
<P>(8) Touching the originall peopling of this faire Iland, if we will beleeue their records, they
make antiquitie it selfe but young vnto themselues, affirming the damsell <HI>Caesarea,</HI> and niece vnto
<PB REF="181"/>
<HI>Noah,</HI> to haue found it out before the Floud; and that three hundred yeares after; when <HI>Ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hets</HI> po∣steritie
tooke into these West-parts of the world, one <HI>Barthela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> of his progeny, a <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ythian</HI> by birth,
encouraged by the late successe of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rod</HI> (who now had intruded vpon the Monarchy of <HI>Syria)</HI>
wandred so farre West, that <HI>Fortune</HI> at last cast him and his people vpon the coast of <HI>Ireland.</HI> There
he setled with his three sonnes, <HI>Languinna, Salarus,</HI> and <HI>Ruthurgus,</HI> who searching through euery
creeke and corner of the Land, left their owne names by three notable places, <HI>Langui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Stragrus,</HI>
and Mount <HI>Salanga,</HI> which the reuolution of times hath since called by other names, as S. <HI>Dominick∣hill,
Ruthurgi,</HI> and <HI>Stag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI> Vnder the gouernment of these three sonnes, and their off-spring, this
land was kept about three hundred yeares; at which time there arriued also in <HI>Ireland</HI> a Giant-like
kinde of people of <HI>Nimrods</HI> race, who in bodily shape exceeded the proportion of vsuallmen, vsing
their strengths to winne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and to oppreste with rapine and violence. These growing to
numbers, accounted it neces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary to preuent dominion, lest the curse of slauery (prophecied by <HI>Noah)</HI>
should light vpon them: to preuent the which, they set vp a King of their owne; then quarrels bred
daily, either parties purposing to hold their interest by their swords: against whom, lastly a battle was
fought, and an infinite company of Giants slaine▪ when also died most of those of the posteritie of
<HI>Iapheth,</HI> leauing them of <HI>Cham</HI> Lords of Iland.</P>
<P>(9) Whereupon <HI>Nemethus</HI> a <HI>Scythian,</HI> with his foure sonnes, arriued in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and by strong
hand seated themselues among these Grants; where for two hundred and sixtie yeares they kept, but
then no longer able to hold out against them, they left their standings, and departed the land.</P>
<P>(10) Soone after, the fiue sonnes of <HI>Dela,</HI> descended from the said <HI>Nemethus,</HI> came into these coasts,
and with manly prowes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e droue these miscreants out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whereby the seed of <HI>Cham</HI> was vtterly
expelled, &amp; these of <HI>Iapheth</HI> diuided the land into fiue parts, whereof they became themselues Kings:
<PB REF="182"/>
but falling at variance, gaue aduantage vnto others, among whom the BRITAINES set in
a foot.</P>
<P>(11) But to make this Iland more famous, certaine Historians haue fetched their Kings from
most vncertaine Records, as namely from <HI>Gaothel</HI> the <HI>Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Scotia</HI> (the daughter of King <HI>Pha∣rao,</HI>
and nourisher of <HI>Moses)</HI> his wife: who at that time, when <HI>Israel</HI> were in <HI>Egypt,</HI> with a Colony
came into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and after into <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he was made King, and in honour of his Queene,
the land named <HI>Scotia,</HI> from whom also the Inhabitants tooke name: his posteritie increasing in the
parts of <HI>Spaine,</HI> where first they had seated, in proces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of time sought further aduentures vnder the
foure sonnes of <HI>Milesius</HI> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> whose names were <HI>Hibernus, Hermion, Euer,</HI> and <HI>Eri∣mon.</HI></P>
<P>(12) These, by the direction sufferance, and assistance of <HI>Gurguntius,</HI> King of the <HI>Britaines,</HI> after
that <HI>Ireland</HI> had beene very much dispeopled by a contagious pestilence, seated themselues, and from
the eldest, <HI>Hiberius,</HI> called the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>and <HI>Hibernia,</HI> as some are of opinion: these diuided the whole into
fiue Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nces, famously knowne by the names of <HI>Mounster, Leinster, Connaught, Vlster,</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath</HI>
in their midst: and from these the present <HI>Irish</HI> repute themselues to come. Yet surely, as I make no
question, but that this Iland became inhabited euen of old time, when mankinde againe ouer-spred
the face of the earth, so doubt I not, but that our <HI>Britaines</HI> pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed thereinto themselues, such infinite
number of words in the <HI>Irish</HI> language yet in vse, such ancient names of Waters, Isles, Mountaines,
and places, meerely <HI>British</HI> words, yet remaining, and the testimony of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acitus,</HI> who saith, that their
manners were fashioned to the <HI>Britaines,</HI> inforceth so much; and <HI>Ptolemy</HI> before him, calleth that I∣land
by the name of <HI>little Britaine:</HI> all which shew a former interest for <HI>Ireland,</HI> then that which by
conquest vnder <HI>Henry</HI> the second was made.</P>
<P><PB REF="182"/>
(13) That it euer was subiect to the <HI>Romans,</HI> is doubtfull, though <HI>Agricola</HI> did wish it, and <HI>Taci∣tus</HI>
held most necessary: yea, and in the diuision of their Empire, <HI>Ireland,</HI> with <HI>Britaine</HI> and <HI>Thule,</HI> fell
vnto <HI>Constantine</HI> the sonne of <HI>Constantine</HI> the great; yet their manners vnreclaimed, and barbarisme
retained long after those dayes, doe witnesse no such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sowne, to be in that plot. But when
<HI>Romes</HI> great Empire began to grow lesse, the <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>Scythians</HI> grew mightie in <HI>Ireland:</HI> and as <HI>Oros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>
writeth, that Island was wholly inhabited by the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation in the dayes of <HI>Honorius,</HI> and <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dius,</HI>
the Emperours: whose warres and slaughter, <HI>Claudian</HI> doth lightly touch in this his Verse.</P>
<Q><L>Scotorum cumulos fleuit glacialis Ierne.</L></Q>
<Q><L>The frozen Ireland wept to see, her Scots all slaine on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apes to be.</L></Q>
<P>(14) <HI>As these for the most part, by the testimony of</HI> Ninius, <HI>were the ancient Inhabitants, so by
other ancient Writers, their customes and manners are thus set forth:</HI> Strabo <HI>saith,</HI> The Inhabitants
of <HI>Ireland</HI> are more rude then the <HI>Britaines,</HI> they feed vpon the flesh of men, yea, and thinke it a point of worth
to eat their dead parents: want only they accompany with women, making no difference of other mens wiues,
their owne sisters, nor of their naturall mothers: but of these things <HI>(saith he)</HI> we haue no certaine witnesse
of sufficient credit. Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ponius Mela <HI>recordeth, that</HI> the <HI>Irish</HI> are vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iuill, ignorant of vertues, and void
of religion: <HI>And</HI> Solinus <HI>affirmeth, that</HI> after victory they drinke the bloud of the slaine, and besmeare their
owne faces therewith; so giuen to warre, that the mother at the birth of a man-childe, feedeth the first meat
into her infants mouth, vpon the point of her husbands sword, and with he at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enish imprecations, wisheth that
it may die no otherwise then in warre or by sword.</P>
<P>(15) But from these ancient and barbarous manners, let vs come to the conditions of their mid∣dle
time; whom <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> describeth as followeth: <HI>The Irish</HI> (saith he) are a strong and bold
<PB REF="183"/>
<HI>people, martiall and prodigall in warre, nimble, stout, and haughtie of heart; carelesse of life, but greedie of
glory; courteous to strangers, constant in loue, light of beliefe, impatient of iniurie, giuen to fleshly lusts, and
in enmitie implacable.</HI> At the baptizing of their Infants, their manner was, not to dip their right armes
into the water, that so (as they thought) they might giue a more deepe and incurable blow; neuer
calling them by the names of their Parents whilest they liued together, but at their death tooke it
vpon them. Their women nursed not the children they bare; and they that nursed others, did affect
and loue them much more then their owne.</P>
<P>(16) So much were they giuen to fantasticall conceits, that they held it very ominous to giue
their neighbours fire vpon <HI>May-day:</HI> to eat an old egge, endangered the death of their horse: and be∣fore
they cast in their seed, they send salt into the field: to hang vp the shelles in the roofe, was a
preseruatiue of the chickens from the kite: to set vp greene boughes at their doores in the Moneth
of May, increased their kines milke; and to spit vpon Cattle, they held it good against Witchery,
whereof <HI>Ireland</HI> was full.</P>
<P>(17) Superstitious Idolatry among the wilde <HI>Irish</HI> was common, yeelding diuine honour vnto
the Moone after the change, vnto whom they both bowed their knees, and made supplications; and
with a loud voice would thus speake vnto that Planet: <HI>Wee pray thee leaue vs in as good estate as thou
foundst vs.</HI> Wolues they did make their Godsibs, terming them <HI>Chari Christ,</HI> and so thought them∣selues
preserued from their hurts: the hoofes of dead horses they accounted and held sacred: about
childrens necks they hung the beginning of Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> Gospell, a crooked naile of an horse-shooe,
or a peece of a Wolues skinne; and both the sucking-childe and nurse were girt with girdles finely
plated of womans haire; so farre they wandred into the wayes of errour, in making these armes the
strength of their healths.</P>
<P>(18) Their wiues were many, by reason of diuorcements, and their maids married at twelue
<PB REF="183"/>
yeares of age, whose customes were to send to their louers, bracelets plated, and curiously wrought of
their owne haire; so farre following <HI>Venus</HI> in the knots of these a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urements. The men wore linnen
shirts exceedingly large, stained with Saffron, the sleeues wide, and hanging to their knees, strait and
short trustes plated thicke in the skirts, their breeches close to the thighes, a short skeine hanging
point downe before, and a mantle most times cast ouer their heads. The women wore their haire
plated in curious manner, hanging downe their backes and shoulders, from vnder soulden wreathes
of fine linnen, rolled about their heads, rather loading the wearer, then delighting the beholder:
for as the one was most seemely, so the other was vnsightly: their neckes were hung with chaines
and carkaneths, their armes wreathed with many bracelets, and ouer their side-garments the shagge
rugge mantles purfled with a deepe Fringe of diuers colours, both sexes accounting idlenes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e their
onely libertie, and ease their greatest riches.</P>
<P>(19) In warres they were forward, and fought with battle-axes, whose bearers were called <HI>Gal∣loglasses,</HI>
the common Souldier but lightly armed, who serued with darts and sharpe skeines; their
Trumpet was a Bagge-pipe, and word for encounter, <HI>Pharroh;</HI> which at the first onset with great
acclamation they vttered, and he that did not, was taken into the ayre, and carried into the vale of
<HI>Kerr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> where transformed (as they did beleeue) he remained vntill he was hunted with Hounds
from thence to his home.</P>
<P>(20) For the dying and dead they hired women to mourne, who expostulated with the sicke,
why he would die; and dead, at his Funerall such out-cries were made, such clapping of hands, such
howlings, and gestures, that one would thinke their sorrowes vnrecouerable, holding the opinion
of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> for the soules departed.</P>
<P>(21) Their dyet in necessitie was slender, feeding vpon water-cresses, rootes, mushromes, sham∣rogh,
butter tempered with oat-meale, milke, whey, yea, and raw flesh, the bloud being crushed out:
<PB REF="184"/>
their vse was also to let their kine bloud, which standing a while, and comming to a ielly, with but∣ter
they did eat, as a very good dish.</P>
<P>(22) That the Gospell of Christ should be preached in <HI>Ireland</HI> by <HI>Iames</HI> the Apostle, I will not
affirme, though <HI>Vincentius</HI> hath said it: neither will I, with the <HI>Scots,</HI> bring the Ilands conuersion from
a Christian woman, who (as their Historians doe auouch) first instructed the Queene, and the
Queene her husband, and he againe his Subiects, till all became Christians. But most true it is, that
the <HI>Scots</HI> first receiued the doctrine of Christ in this Kingdome of <HI>Ireland;</HI> for thus writeth <HI>Prosper:
Coelestin Pope of Rome sent his Archdeacon Palladius into Britaine to withstand the Pelagian heresie, who at
one time did driue out these enemies of grace, and ordained a Bishop among the Scots, whereby that barba∣rous
Nation embraced Christianitie.</HI> Yet <HI>Ninius</HI> reporteth, that <HI>Palladius</HI> did nothing in neither, being
taken away by vntimely death: but that S. <HI>Patricke,</HI> borne at <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burne</HI> in <HI>Cluedsdale,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Cal∣phurus,</HI>
by the sister of S. <HI>Martin,</HI> was the first Apostle for <HI>Ireland,</HI> who sowed his heauenly seede
with such plentifull increase, that the soile it selfe shortly was called <HI>Sanctorum Patria, the Country of
Saints:</HI> for whose Sepulchre after his death rose as great variance, as was for <HI>Homer</HI> amongst them
of <HI>Greece:</HI> they of <HI>Downe</HI> challenged his graue to be with them, vpon certaine Verses written on a
Tombe, which ascribes <HI>Patricke, Briget,</HI> and <HI>Columbe</HI> to be buried therein: they of <HI>Armagh</HI> lay claime
by the warrant of S. <HI>Bernard,</HI> who saith, that <HI>Patricke in his life time there ruled, and after death there
rested. Glascenbury</HI> in <HI>England</HI> by ancient records will haue his bodie interred with them; and <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
auoucheth his birth to be at <HI>Glasco,</HI> and bones to rest at <HI>Kirk-Patricke</HI> with them: of such reue∣rent
esteeme was this <HI>Irish</HI> Apostle.</P>
<P>(23) This <HI>Patricke</HI> in his youth had beene taken captiue by the <HI>Irish</HI> Pirats, and for sixe yeares
continuance serued <HI>Mac<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uain</HI> as his slaue, and keeper of his swine: in which deiected condition, so
desirous he was of the Lands saluation, that in his dreames he thought the Infants vnborne cryed
<PB REF="184"/>
vnto him for Baptisme; and redeeming himselfe thence for a peece of gold found in the field, which
a swine had turned vp, in his aged yeares came backe againe into <HI>Ireland,</HI> preached the Gospell, con∣uerted
the people, and lastly became Archbishop of <HI>Armagh.</HI> Of whose miracles and Purgatorie,
I leaue others to speake; that are more credulous in the one, and haue better leisure to relate the o∣ther,

<HEAD>THE PROVINCE OF MOVNSTER.
CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THis Prouince, called in <HI>Irish, Mown;</HI> in a more ordinary construction of speech, <HI>Wown;</HI> in
<HI>Latine, Momonia;</HI> and in <HI>English, Mounster;</HI> lieth open South ward to the <HI>Verginian Sea:</HI>
North-ward it affronteth part of <HI>Connaught:</HI> The East is neighboured by <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster:</HI> and the
West is altogether washed with the West Ocean.</P>
<P>(2) The length thereof extended from <HI>Ballatimore</HI>-Bay in her South, vnto the Bay of <HI>Gal∣way</HI>
in her North, are about nintie miles. Her broadest part from East to West, is from <HI>Waterford-Hauen</HI>
to <HI>Feriter Hauen,</HI> and containeth an hundred miles. The whole circumference, by following
the prometaries and indents, are aboue fiue hundred and fortie miles.</P>
<P>(3) The forme thereof is quadrant or foure-square. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> milde and temperate, neither too
chilling cold, not too scorching hot. The soyle in some parts is hilly, looking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with wooddy,
wilde, and solitary mountaines: yet the vallies below are garnished with Corne-fields. And gene∣rally,
all, both pleasant for fight, and fertile for soile.</P>
<P>(4) This Prouince is at this day diuided into two parts that is, the West-<HI>Mounster,</HI> and the
South-<HI>Mounster.</HI> The West-<HI>Mounster</HI> was inhabited i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Velabri,</HI> and the

(by <HI>Orosius)</HI> to haue dwelt in that part of the Country, where it lyeth outmost Westward, and pas∣sing
towards the <HI>Cantabrian</HI> Ocean, looketh a farre off to <HI>Gallitia</HI> in <HI>Spaine.</HI> The <HI>Luceni</HI> of <HI>Ireland</HI>
(who seeme to haue deriued their name and originall from the <HI>Lucen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> of <HI>Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tia,</HI> and of whom there
still remaine some reliques in the Barony of <HI>Lyxno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>)</HI> are supposed to haue bin seated in those parts
that lie neighbouring vpon the banke of the Riuer <HI>Shemon.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="186"/>
(5) The generall Commodities of this Prouince, are Corne, Cattle, Wood, Wooll, and Fish.
The last whereof, it affords in euery place plenty &amp; abundance of all sorts. But none so well knowne
for the store of Herrings that are taken there, as is the Promontory called <HI>Eraugh,</HI> that lies betweene
<HI>Bantre</HI> and <HI>Ballatimore</HI> Bay, whereunto euery yeare a great Fleet of <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> resort
(euen in the middest of Winter) to fish also for Cods.</P>
<P>(6) The principall Citie of the Prouince is <HI>Limericke,</HI> which the <HI>Irish</HI> call <HI>Loumeagh,</HI> compassed
about with the famous Riuer <HI>Shennon,</HI> by the parting of the Channell. This is a Bishops See, and the
very Mart-Towne of <HI>Mounster.</HI> It was first wonne by <HI>Reymond le Grosse</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> afterwards
burnt by <HI>Duncnald</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> petty King of <HI>Thuetmond.</HI> Then in processe of time, <HI>Philip Breos</HI> an <HI>Eng∣lishman</HI>
was infeoffed in it, and King <HI>Iohn</HI> fortified it with a Castle, which he caused therein to be
built. In this Castle certaine Hostages making their abode in the yeare 1332 grew (as is reported)
so full of pride and insolency, that they flew the Constable thereof, and seized the Castle into their
owne hands. But the resolute Citizens, that could neither brooke nor beare with such barbareus
crueltie, did in reuenge then shew such manly courage and viuacitie, as they soone after recouered
the Castle againe, repaying the Hostages in such hostile manner, as that they put them all to the
sword without partialitie. The position of this Towne is by <HI>Mercator</HI> placed for Latitude 53. de∣grees
20. minutes; and for Longitude, 9. degrees and 34. minutes. Neere vnto the Riuer that <HI>Pto∣lemy</HI>
calleth <HI>Daucona,</HI> and <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> (by the alteration of some few letters) nameth <HI>Saura∣nus</HI>
and <HI>Sauarenus,</HI> which issueth out of <HI>Muskerey</HI> Mountaines, is seated the Citie <HI>Corke,</HI> graced also
with another Episcopall dignitie (and with the Bishops See of <HI>Clon</HI> annexed vnto it) which <HI>Giraldus</HI>
calleth <HI>Corragia,</HI> the <HI>Englishmen Corke,</HI> &amp; the natiue Inhabitants of the Country <HI>Coreach.</HI> This Towne
is so beset on euery side with neighbouring molesters, as that they are still constrained to keepe
watch and ward, as if there lay continuall siege against it. The Citizens of this place are all linkt
<PB REF="186"/>
together in some one or other degree of affinitie, for that they dare not match their daughters in
marriage into the Country, but make contracts of matrimony one with another among themselues.
In this place, that holy and religious man <HI>Briock</HI> is said to haue his birth and breeding, who flourished
among the <HI>Gaules</HI> in that fruitfull age of Christianitie, and from whom the Diocesse of <HI>Sanbr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>och</HI> in
<HI>Britaine Armorua,</HI> commonly called S▪ <HI>Brieu,</HI> had the denomination.</P>
<P>(7) The Citie which the <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Britaines</HI> call <HI>Porthlargy,</HI> and the <HI>English, Waterford,</HI> though it
be last in place, yet is it not least in account, as being the second Citie of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well for the
conuenience and commodiousnesse of the Hauen, that affords such necessary aptitude for trade and
traffique, as also for the faithfull loyaltie which it hath alwayes shewed to the Imperiall Crowne of
<HI>England:</HI> for euer since it was wonne by <HI>Richard</HI> Earle of <HI>Pembrook<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> it still performed the obedience
and peaceable offices of dutie and seruice vnto the <HI>English,</HI> as they continued their course in the con∣quest
of <HI>Ireland:</HI> whence it is that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> haue from time to time endowed it with
many large Franchises and Liberties, which King <HI>Henry</HI> the seauenth did both augment and con∣firme.</P>
<P>(8) Although since the time of S. <HI>Patricke,</HI> Christianitie was neuer extinct in this Country, yet
the gouernment being haled into contrary factions, the Nobility lawles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and the multitude wilfull,
it hath come to passe, that Religion hath waxed (with the temporall common sort) more cold and
feeble, being most of them very irreligious, and addicted wholly to superstitious obseruations: for in
some parts of this Prouince, some are of opinion, that certaine men are yearely turned into Wolues,
and made Wolfe-men. Though this hath beene constantly affirmed by such as thinke their censures
worthy to passe for currant and credible; yet let vs suppose that happily they be possessed with the
disease and maladie that the Physicians call Lycanthropy, which begetteth and engendreth such like
phantasies through the malicious humours of Melancholy: and so oftentimes men imagine them∣selues
<PB REF="187"/>
to be turned and transformed into formes which they are not. Some againe embrace another
ridiculous opinion, and perswade themselues, that he who in the barbarous acclamation and outcry
of the Souldiers, which they vse with great forcing and straining of their voices, when they ioyne
battaile, doth not howte and make a noise as the rest doe, is suddenly caught from the ground, and
carried as it were flying in the ayre, out of any Country of <HI>Ireland,</HI> into some desert vallies, where he
feedeth vpon grasse, drinketh water, hath some vse of reason, but not of speech, is ignorant of the
present condition he stands in, whether good or bad: yet at length shall be brought to his own home,
being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aught with the helpe of Hounds and Hunters. Great pitie that the foule fiend and father of
darknesse, should so grieuously seduce this people with misbeliefe, and that these errours be not cha∣sed
away with the truth of Christian Religion, whereby as they carry much grace in their counte∣nances,
they may also not be void of the inward grace of their soules and vnderstanding.</P>
<P>(9) This Prouince hath beene fore wasted in the rebellions of <HI>Desmond,</HI> to whose ayde Pope
<HI>Gregory</HI> the thirteenth, and <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> sent certaine companies of <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
who arriued not farre from <HI>Dingle,</HI> fortified themselues, &amp; gaue it the name of <HI>Fort de Ore,</HI> founding
loud threats against the whole Country. But <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ur</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Grey,</HI> Lord Deputie of <HI>Ireland,</HI> at the
first onset decided their quarrell, by sheathing his sword in their bowels: and <HI>Desmond</HI> fearefully fly∣ing
into the woods, was by a Souldier cut shorter by the head. And againe, when the Kingdome of
<HI>Ireland</HI> lay bleeding, and put almost to the hazard of the last cast, <HI>Don Iohn D' Aquila,</HI> with 8. thou∣sand
<HI>Spaniards</HI> (vpon confidence of the excommunications of <HI>Pius</HI> the fift, <HI>Gregory</HI> the thirteenth,
&amp; <HI>Clement</HI> the eight, <HI>Popes,</HI> all of them discharging their curses like vnto thunder bolts against Queene
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> of blessed memory) landed neere vnto <HI>Kinsale</HI> presuming that the rebellions of <HI>Tyrone</HI> had
turned the hearts of the <HI>Irish</HI> for <HI>Rome:</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Blunt</HI> Lord <HI>Montioy,</HI> in the depth of Winter, and
with his tired Souldiers, so d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nted their <HI>Spanish</HI> hearts, that with one victory he repressed their
bragging boldnesse, and recouered the <HI>Irish</HI> that were ready to reuolt.</P>
<P><PB REF="187"/>
(10) God hath oftentimes shewed his tender loue and affection to this people, in laying his fa∣therly
chastisements and afflictions vpon them, sometimes by windes, sometimes by famine and
dearth, and sometimes againe by opening his hand of plenty into their laps to conuert them to him∣selfe,
and to diuert their hearts from superstitions. In the yeare 1330 about the Feast of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, there be an such a dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e in this Country, by the abundance of raine and the inun∣dation
of waters (which continued vntill <HI>Michaelmas</HI> following) that a Cranoc of Wheat was sold
for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, a Cranoc of Oats for eight shillings, a Cranoc of Pease, Beanes, and Barley for
as much. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the same yeare were so mightie, that many were hurt, and many slaine outright
by the fall of houses that was forced by the violence of the same. The like whereof were neuer seene
in <HI>Ireland.</HI> In the yeare 1317 there was such a dearth of Corne and other victuals, that a Cranoc of
Wheat was sold for twentie three shillings. And many Housholders, that before time had sustained
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a great number, were this yeare driuen to beg, and many famished. In the time of which
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mine, the mercy of God so disposed, that vpon the 27. day of Iune, in the yeare 1331▪ there came
to land such a mightie multitude of great Sea-fishes (that is) <HI>Thursheds,</HI> such as in many ages past
had neuer beene seene, that the people were much comforted in this distresse, and receiued great re∣liefe
and sustenance by the same.</P>
<P>(11) Places of Rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion in this Country, were the two Abbies at <HI>Yoghall,</HI> called the <HI>North-Ab∣bey</HI>
and <HI>South-Abbey:</HI> The two Abbies at <HI>Limericke,</HI> S. <HI>Francis</HI> Abbey, and S <HI>Dominicke</HI> Abbey:
The two Abbies at <HI>Corke,</HI> the Abbey of the Ile, and S. <HI>Frances</HI> Abbey: and the famous Abbey (in
times past) of the holy Crosse which hath had many priuiledges and liberties granted vnto it, in ho∣nour
of a peece of <HI>Christs Crosse,</HI> that was (as they say) sometimes preserued there. Thus were Chri∣stians
perswaded in ancient times▪ And it is a wonder in what Troopes and Assemblies people doe
(euen yet) conflow thither vpon deuotion, as vnto a place of holinesse and sanct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; so firmely are
<PB REF="188"/>
they settled in the Religion of their Fore-fathers, which hath beene increased beyond all measure
by the negligent care of their Teachers, who should instruct their ignorance, and labour to reduce
them from the errors they perseuere in.</P>
<P>This Prouince is gouerned by a Lord President, who hath one assistant, twelue learned Lawyers,
and a Secretary to keepe it in dutie and obedience. It was in times past diuided into many parts,
as <HI>Towoun,</HI> that is, <HI>North-Mounster; Deswoun,</HI> that is, <HI>South-Mounster; Hierwoun,</HI> that is, <HI>West-Moun∣ster;
Mean-woun,</HI> that is, <HI>Middle Monaster;</HI> and <HI>Vrwoun,</HI> that is, the Front of <HI>Mounster.</HI> But at this
day it is distinguished into these Counties; <HI>Kerry, Desmond, Limericke, Tipperary, Holycrosse, Water∣ford,
and Corke:</HI> which County in times past had beene a Kingdome, containing with it <HI>Desmond</HI>
also: for so in the Grant giuen by King <HI>Henry</HI> the second vnto <HI>Robert Fitz-Stephen,</HI> and to <HI>Miles de
Cogan,</HI> it is called in these words: <HI>Know yee that I haue granted the whole Kingdome of Corke, excepting
the Citie and Cantred of the Oustmans, to hold for them and their heires, of me and Iohn my sonne, by the ser∣uice

with fiue strong Castles, traded with sixe Market-Townes, and diuided as followeth.

CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THis Country, the Natiues call <HI>Leighnigh,</HI> the <HI>Britaines Lein;</HI> in <HI>Latine, Lagenia;</HI> in the anci∣ent
liues of the Saints, <HI>Lagen;</HI> and in <HI>English, Leinster.</HI> It lieth Eastward along <HI>Hibernicum</HI>
Sea: on <HI>Connaught</HI> side Westward it is bounded with the Riuer <HI>Shanon;</HI> the North with the
Territorie of <HI>Louth,</HI> and the South with part of the Prouince of <HI>Mounster.</HI> This Country
butteth vpon <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Mounster</HI> and <HI>Connaught</HI> doe vpon <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is triangle, and sides not much vnequall, from her South-East vnto the
West-point about 80. miles, from thence to her North-West about 70. miles, and her East Coast a∣long
the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea-shore, eightie miles: the circumference vpon two hundred and seauentie miles.</P>
<P>(3) The aire is cleare and gentle, mixt with a temperate disposition, yeelding neither extremitie
of heat or cold, according to the seasonable times of the yeare, and the naturall condition of the
Continent. The soile is generally fruitfull, plentifull both in fish and flesh, and in other victuals,
as butter, cheese, and mile. It is fertile in Corne, Cattle, and pasture grounds, and would be much
more, if the husbandman did but apply his industry, to which he is inuited by the commodiousnesse
of the Country. It is well watered with Riuers, and for the most part well woodded, except the
Countie of <HI>Diuelin,</HI> which complaines much of that want, being so destitute of wood, that they are
compelled to vse a clammie kinde of fat turffe for their fuell, or Sea-coale brought out of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The Inhabitants of these parts in <HI>Ptolemies</HI> dayes were the <HI>Brigantes, Mena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, Cauci,</HI> and <HI>Bla∣in;</HI>
from which <HI>Blani</HI> may seeme to be deriued and contracted the latter and moderne names of this
Country, <HI>Lein, Leighnigh,</HI> and <HI>Leinster.</HI> The <HI>Mena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> (as the name doth after a sort imply) came from
<PB REF="189"/>
the <HI>Menapians,</HI> a Nation in <HI>Low Germany,</HI> that dwelt by the Sea-Coasts. These <HI>Brigantes,</HI> ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed also
<HI>Birgantes, Florianus del Campo</HI> (a <HI>Spaniard)</HI> labours to fetch from the <HI>Brigants</HI> of his owne Country,
of whom an ancient Citie in <HI>Spaine</HI> (called <HI>Brigantia)</HI> tooke the name. But they may seeme rather
to deriue their denomination from the Riuer <HI>Birgus,</HI> about which they inhabited; for to this the ve∣ry
name is almost sufficient to perswade vs.</P>
<P>(5) The commodities of this Country doe chiefly consist in Cattle, Sea-fowle, and Fish. It
breeds many excellent good horses, called <HI>Irish Hobbies,</HI> which haue not the same pace that other
horses haue in their course, but a soft and round amble, setting very easily.</P>
<P>(6) This Country hath in it three Riuers of note, termed in old time the three sisters, <HI>Shour,
Neor,</HI> and <HI>Barraeo,</HI> which issue out of the huge Mountaine (called by <HI>Giraldus, Bladina Montes)</HI> as
out of their mothers wombe, and from their rising tops descending with a downefall into seuerall
Channels, before they emptie themselues into the Ocean, ioyne hand in hand all together in a mu∣tuall
league and combination.</P>
<P>(7) Places very dangerous for shipping are certaine fiats and shallowes in the Sea, that lie ouer
against Holy-point, which the Marriners call the <HI>Grounds.</HI> Also the shelues of sand that lie a great
way in length opposite to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which ouer-looketh them into the Sea from the top of an high
hill adioyning.</P>
<P>(8) In this Prouince are placed many faire and wealthy Townes, as <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> which for a Bur∣rough-Towne
excels all the midland Burroughs in this Iland. <HI>Kildare,</HI> which is adorned with an E∣piscopall
See, and much graced in the first infancy of the <HI>Irish</HI> Church, by reason of Saint <HI>Bridgid</HI> a
venerable Virgin, had in great account and estimation for her virginitie and deuotion, as who was
the Disciple of S. <HI>Patricke</HI> of so great fame, renowne, and antiquite: Also <HI>Weisford</HI> (a name giuen
vnto it by these <HI>Germans,</HI> whom the <HI>Irish</HI> terme <HI>Oustmans)</HI> a Towne though inferiour to some, yet as
<PB REF="190"/>
memorable as any, for that it became the first Colony of the <HI>English,</HI> and did first submit it selfe vnto
their protection, being assaulted by <HI>Fitz Stephen,</HI> a Captaine worthily made famous for his valour
and magnanimitie.</P>
<P>(9) But the Citie which fame may iustly celebrate alone, beyond all the Cities or Townes in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> is that which we call <HI>Diuelin, Ptole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie Eblana,</HI> the <HI>Latinists Dublinium,</HI> and <HI>Dublinia;</HI> the <HI>West-Britaines,
Dinas Dulm;</HI> the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> in times past, <HI>Duplin;</HI> and the <HI>Irish, Balacleigh,</HI> that is, the
Towne vpon hurdles: for it is reported that the place being fennish and moorish, when it first began
to be builded, the foundation was laid vpon hurdles.</P>
<P>(10) That it is ancient, is perswaded by the authoritie of <HI>Ptol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mie.</HI> That it was grieuously rent
and dismembred in the tamultuous warres of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and brought afterwards vnder the sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecti∣on
of <HI>Eadgar</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> (which his Charter also confirmeth, wherein he calleth it the noble
Citie of <HI>Ireland)</HI> is written by <HI>Saxo Grammaticus.</HI> That it was built by <HI>Harold</HI> of <HI>Norway,</HI> which
may seeme to be <HI>Harold Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ager,</HI> when he had brought the greatest part of <HI>Ireland</HI> into an awfull

streights and commotions.</P>
<P>(11) This is the royall seat of <HI>Ireland,</HI> strong in her munition, beautifull in her buildings, and
(for the quantitie) matchable to many other Cities, frequent for trafficke and intercourse of Mer∣chants▪
In the East Suburbs, <HI>Henry</HI> the second, King of <HI>England</HI> (as <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ueden</HI> reporteth) caused a roy∣all
Pallace to be erected: and <HI>Henry Loundres,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Diuelin,</HI> built a Store-house about the
<PB REF="190"/>
yeare of Christ 1220. Not farre from it is the beautifull Colledge consecrated vnto the name of the
holy Trinitie, which Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of famous memory dignified with the priuiledges of an V∣niuersitie.
The Church of S. <HI>Patricke</HI> being much enlarged by King <HI>Iohn,</HI> was by <HI>Iohn Comin</HI> Archbi∣shop
of <HI>Dublin,</HI> borne at <HI>Euesham</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> first ordained to be a Church of Prebends in the yeare
1191. It doth at this day maintaine a Deane, a Chanter, a Chancellor, a Treasurer, two Archdea∣cons,
and twentie two Prebendaries.</P>
<P>This Citie in times past, for the due administration of Ciuill Gouernment, had a Prouost for the
chiefe Magistrate. But in the yeare of mans redemption 1409 King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth granted them
libertie to chuse euery yeare a Maior and two Bailistes, and that the Maior should haue a gilt sword
carried before him for euer. And King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixt (to heape more honour vpon this place)
changed the two Bailiffes afterwards into Sheriffes: so that there is not any thing here wanting that
may serue to make the estate of a Citie most flourishing.</P>
<P>(12) As the people of this County doe about the neighbouring parts of <HI>Diuelin</HI> come neerest
vnto the ciuill conditions and orderly subiection of the <HI>English:</HI> so in places farther off they are more
tumultuous, being at deadly feuds amongst themselues, committing oft times Man-slaughter one
vpon another, and working their owne mischiefes by mutuall wrongs: for so the <HI>Irish</HI> of <HI>Leinster</HI> wa∣sted
<HI>Leinster</HI> with many Townes in the same Prouince in the yeare 1294. And in the yeare 1301.
the men of <HI>Leinster</HI> in like manner raised a warre in the winter season, setting on fire the Towne of
<HI>Wyk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lo, Rathdon,</HI> and others, working their owne plague and punishment by burning vp their suste∣nance,
and losing their Castle by depredation.</P>
<P>(13) Matter of obseruation, and no lesse admiration among them, is the Giants dance, com∣monly
so called, and so much talked of, which <HI>Merlin</HI> is said by Art Magicke to haue translated out
of this Territorie vnto <HI>Salisburie</HI> Plaine: which how true it is, I leaue to the vaine beleeuers of mi∣racles,
and to the credulous obseruers of antiquitie.</P>
<P><PB REF="191"/>
(14) In this County haue beene erected many famous Monasteries, Abbies, and religious hou∣ses,
consecrated to deuout and holy purposes: As the Monastery of Saint <HI>Maries</HI> of <HI>Oustmanby,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded for preaching Friers, vnto which of late dayes the Iudiciall Courts of the Kingdome haue
beene translated: also the magnificent Abbey called S. <HI>Thomas</HI> Court at <HI>Dublin,</HI> builded and endow∣ed

of the murther of <HI>Thomas</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> Likewise <HI>Tiutern</HI> Monastery, or the notable

<HEAD>THE PROVINCE OF CONNAVGHT.
CHAPTER IIII.</HEAD>
<P>THis Prouince named by <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis, Conachtia,</HI> and <HI>Conacia,</HI> by the <HI>Irish, Conaughty,</HI>
and by <HI>English-men, Connaught:</HI> is bounded East-ward, with part of the County of <HI>Leinster;</HI>
North-ward, with part of <HI>Vlster;</HI> West-ward, with the West-maine Ocean; and on the South,
it is confined with a part of the Prouince of <HI>Mounster,</HI> closed in with the Riuer <HI>Sbennon,</HI> and
butting against the Kingdome of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is long, and towards the North and South ends, thinne and narrow;
but as it growes towards the middle, from either part it waxeth still bigger and bigger: extending in
length from the Riuer <HI>Shennon</HI> in her South, to <HI>Enis Kelling</HI> in her North, 126. miles, and the broadest
part is from <HI>Tromer</HI> in her East, to <HI>Barragh-Bay</HI> in her West, containing about fourescore miles.
The whole in circuit and compasse is aboue foure hundred miles.</P>
<P>(3) The aire is not altogether so pure and cleare, as in the other Prouinces of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by reason
of certaine moist places (couered ouer with grasse) which of their softnesse are vsually termed
Boghes, both dangerous, and full of vaporous and foggie mists.</P>
<P>(4) This County as it is diuided into seuerall portions, so is euery portion seuerally commended
for the soile, according to the seasonable times of the yeare. <HI>Twomond</HI> or the County <HI>Clare,</HI> is said to
be a Country so conueniently situated, that either from the Sea or Soile there can be nothin wisht
for more, then what it doth naturally afford of it selfe, were but the industry of the Inhabitants an∣swerable
to the rest. <HI>Galway</HI> is a land very thankfull to the painefull husbandman, and no lesse com∣modious
and profitable to the Shepheard. <HI>Maio,</HI> in the <HI>Roman Prouinciall</HI> called <HI>Mageo,</HI> is repleni∣shed
<PB REF="192"/>
both with pleasure and fertility, abundantly rich in Cattle, Deere, Hawkes, and plenty of Hony.
<HI>Slego</HI> (coasting vpon the Sea) is a plenteous Country for feeding and raising of Cattle. <HI>Le-Trim</HI> (a
place rising vp throughout with hilles) is so full of ranke grasse and forrage, that (as <HI>Solinus</HI> repor∣teth)
if Cattle were not kept sometimes from grasing, their fulnesse would endanger them. And
<HI>Rosco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en</HI> is a Territory, for the most part plaine and fruitfull, feeding many Heards of Cattle, and
with meane husbandry and tillage, yeelding plentie of Corne, As euery particular part is thus seue∣rally
profitable by in-bred commodities; so is it no lesse commended (in the generalitie) for the
many accomodate and fit Bayes, Creekes, and nauigable Riuers, lying vpon her Sea-coasts, that
after a sort inuite and prouoke the Inhabitants to nauigation.</P>
<P>(5) Such as in ancient time made their abode and habitations in this Prouince, were the GAN∣GANI,
who were also called CONCANI, AVTERI, and NAGNATAE. As the <HI>Luceni</HI> (that
were next neighbours vnto them) came from the <HI>Luceniji</HI> (in <HI>Spaine)</HI> so those <HI>Gangam</HI> and <HI>Coneani</HI>
may seeme also to haue fetcht their deriuation from the <HI>Concan</HI> (Nation of the selfe-same Coun∣try)
both by the affinitie of name, and vicinitie of place. In <HI>Strabo,</HI> according to the diuersitie of
reading, the same people are named <HI>Coniaci</HI> and <HI>Conisci:</HI> and <HI>Silius</HI> testifieth them at the first to haue
beene <HI>Scythians,</HI> and to haue vsed ordinarily to drinke horses bloud (a thing nothing strange among
the wilde <HI>Irish</HI> euen of late dayes.) And some may also happily suppose that the <HI>Irish</HI> name <HI>Conaugh∣ty,</HI>
was compounded of <HI>Concani</HI> and <HI>Nagnatae.</HI> Howsoeuer, it is sure that these were the ancient Inha∣bitants
of this Country, as is to be seene in <HI>Ptolemie.</HI></P>
<P>(6) The principall Citie of this Prouince, and which may worthily be accounted the third in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> is <HI>Galway,</HI> in <HI>Irish, Galliue,</HI> built in manner much like to a Tower. It is dignified with a Bi∣shops
See, and is much frequented with Merchants, by reason whereof, and the benefit of the Road
and Hauen, it is gainfull to the Inhabitants through traffique and exchange of rich commodities,
<PB REF="193"/>
both by Sea and Iland. Not farre from which, neere the West shoare that lies indented with small
in-lets and out lets in a row, are the Ilands called <HI>Arran,</HI> of which many a foolish fable goes, as if
they were the Ilands of the liuing, wherein none died at any time, or were subiect to moralitie;
which is as supersitious an obseruation, as that vsed in some other corners of the Country, where
the people leaue the right armes of their Infants males vnch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stned (as they terme it) to the end
that at any time afterwards, they might giue a more deadly and vngracious blow when they strike:
which things doe not onely shew how palpably they are carried away by traditious obscurities, but
doe also intimate how full their hearts be of inueterate reuenge.</P>
<P>(7) This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouince presents no matter more worthy of memory, then the battle of <HI>Knoe-toe</HI>
(that is) <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull of axes,</HI> vnder which, the greatest rabble of Rebels, that were euer seene before in
<HI>Ireland</HI> (raised and gathered together by the Arch-Rebels of that time, <HI>William Burk O Brien, Mac-Nomare,</HI>
and <HI>O-Carrol)</HI> were after a bloudy ouerthrow discomfited and put to flight by the noble
seruice of <HI>Girald F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>z-G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rald</HI> Earle of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ildare▪</HI> And the suppression of certaine <HI>Irish</HI> (the posteritie
of <HI>Mac-William)</HI> who vsurping a tyrannie in these parts, raged sometimes vpon themselues, with
mutuall iniuries, and oppressed the poore people a long time with extorting, pilling, and spoiling;
so as they left scarce one house in the Country vnrifled, or vnrased; but were bridled and repressed
(euen in our remebrance) by the seueritie and resolution of the Commissioner of those their
vniust doings, would be a meanes to draw the people away from the due obedience to their Prince:
such therefore as refused to obey the lawes, and sided with the tumultuous, with all care and dili∣gence
he soone scattered, forcing their Forts, and driuing them into woods and lurking holes (for
troubling the blessed estate of tranquilitie) till the Lord Deputie, who tooke pitie of them, vpon
their humble supplication, commanded by his missiues, that they should be receiued vpon tearmes
<PB REF="193"/>
of peace. But they being a stiffenecked people, tooke armes againe, entred a-fresh into actuall re∣bellion,
draue away booties, made foule vprores, and vpon faire promises procured the aid of the
<HI>Scottish</HI> Ilanders, from out of the <HI>Hebrides:</HI> whereupon the Gouernour assembled an Armie, and
pursued them with such powerfull violence through the Woods and Forrests, that after sixe or sea∣uen
weekes, being grieuously hunger-bitten, they submitted themselues in all humilitie. The Auxi∣liarie
Forces also of the <HI>Scots,</HI> he by day and night affronted so neere, and followed so hardly, that
he put them to flight, after he had killed and drowned about three thousand of them in the Riuer
<HI>Moin.</HI></P>
<P>(8) About the yeare 1316. there was such a great slaughter made of the <HI>Irish</HI> in this Prouince
of <HI>Connaught,</HI> through a quarrell that arose there betweene two Lords or Princes, that there were
slaine on both sides about foure thousand men; and so great a tribulation at that time came vpon
the people, that they did deuoure and eat one another, so as of 10000. there remained not aboue
200. liuing. And it is reported for truth, that the people were then so hunger-starued, that in
Church-yards they tooke the dead bodies out of their graues, and in their sculs boiled the flesh, and
fed vpon it: yea, and that women did eat their owne children. Thus appeared the ire and anger of
God, in punishing their sinnes, and seeking their conuersion.</P>
<P>(9) Places memorable, are, <HI>Inis Ceath,</HI> well knowne by the Monastery of <HI>Colman</HI> (a deuout Saint)
founded for <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Englishmen;</HI> and <HI>Inis Bouind,</HI> which <HI>Bede</HI> calleth, <HI>White Calse Isle.</HI> Also <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI>
a Monastery built (as <HI>Bede</HI> writeth) for thirtie men of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. Likewise the Barony of
<HI>Boile,</HI> vnder <HI>Carlew</HI> hilles, where in times past was a famous Abbey built, together with the Abbey
of <HI>Beatitude,</HI> in the yeare of grace 1152: These Abbeyes and Monasteries erected at the first for re∣ligious
seruices, and through ignorance and other obseurities diuerted since vnto superstitious vses,
are now made the ruines of time.</P>

nine Market-Townes, and diuided as ensueth.

<HEAD>THE PROVINCE OF VLSTER.
CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THis Prouince, called by our <HI>Welsh-Britaines Vltw,</HI> in <HI>Irish Cui Guilly,</HI> in <HI>Latine Vltonia,</HI> and <HI>V∣lidia,</HI>
in <HI>English V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sier;</HI> on the North is diuided by a narrow Sea from <HI>Scotland;</HI> South-ward
it extends it selfe to <HI>Connagh</HI> and <HI>Leinster;</HI> the East part lieth vpon the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea; and the West
part is continually beaten with the boisterous rage of the maine West Ocean. This Pro∣uince
and furthest part of <HI>Ireland,</HI> affronteth the <HI>Scotish Ilands,</HI> which are called the <HI>Hebrides,</HI>
and are scattered in the Seas betweene both Kingdomes; whose Inhabitants at this day is the <HI>Irish-Scot,</HI>
successour of the old <HI>Scythian.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is round, reaching in length from <HI>Coldagh</HI>-Hauen in her North, to <HI>Kil∣more</HI>
in her South, neere an hundred miles; and in bredth from <HI>Black-Abbey</HI> in her East, to <HI>Calebegh</HI>
point in her West, one hundred thirtie and odde miles: The whole in circumference, about foure
hundred and twentie miles.</P>
<P>(3) This Country seldome feeleth any vnseasonable extremities, the quicke and flexible windes
cooling the heat of Summer, and soft and gentle showers mollifie the hardnesse of the Winter.
Briefly, the frozen nor torrid Zone haue not here any vsurpation; the clouds in the aire very sweet
and pleasant, yea, and when they are most impure, are not vnwholesome, nor of long continuance,
the rough windes holding them in continuall agitation.</P>
<P>(4) This equall temperature causeth the ground to bring forth great store of seuerall Trees,
both fit for building, and bearing of fruit; plentifull of grasse for the feeding of Cattle, and is a∣bundantly
furnished with Horses, Sheepe and Oxen; the Riuers likewise pay double tribute, deepe
enough to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arry Vessels either for pleasure or profit, and Fish great store, both for their owne vses,
<PB REF="195"/>
and commoditie of others. <HI>Salmons</HI> in some Riuers of this County abound more in number then
in any Riuer of <HI>Europe.</HI> To speake (in generall) though in some places it be somewhat barren,
troubled with <HI>Loughes, Lakes,</HI> and thicke Woods, yet is it euery where fresh, and full of Cattle and
forrage, ready at all times to answer the husbandmans paines. But nature is there so little behol∣ding
to Art or Industry, that the various shew vpon bankes, the shady groues, the greene meadowes,
hanging hilles, and fields fit for Corne, (if they were manured) doe seeme to be angry with their
Inhabitants for suffering all to grow wild and harbarous, through their owne negligence.</P>
<P>(5) This Country in <HI>Ptolemies</HI> dayes was wholly possessed by the <HI>Volutij, Darni, Robogdji,</HI> and <HI>Er∣dini,</HI>
who branched and spred themselues into the seuerall parts that Island.</P>
<P>(6) The people of this Prouince were accustomed in controuersies and solemne protestations,
to sweare by S. <HI>Patrickes Staffe,</HI> which oath they feared more to breake, then if they had sworne by
the holy <HI>Euangelist▪</HI> Their ancient custome in making their King, was this: A white Cow was taken,
which the King must kill, and seeth the same in water whole, then must he bathe himselfe therein
starke naked; and sitting in the Cawdron wherein it was sod, accompanied with his people round
about him, he and they vsed to eat the flesh and drinke the broath wherein he sate, without cup, or
dish, or vse of hand. How farre these prescriptions and customes were different from the conformi∣ties
of other ciuill Monarchies, we may well perceiue by these and other like obseruations of those
grosse times, and as yet they are more barbarous then is any other part of the Island besides.</P>
<P>(7) Historians relating of <HI>Ireland,</HI> tell of seuerall Islands in the seuerall Prouinces: some full of
Angels, some full of Deuils; some for male onely, some for female; some where none may liue,
some where none can die; and such effects of trees, stones, and waters, that a man (but of easie con∣ceit)
may well esteeme them as heedlesse as vncertaine. So also S. <HI>Patrickes</HI> Purgatorie (a thing of
much note in the Tract of this Prouince) is a vault or narrow caue in the ground, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB REF="196"/>
(called <HI>Erne Liffer)</HI> much spoken of, by reason of (I wot not what) fearefull walking spirits and
dreadfull apparitions, (or rather some religious horrour) which (as some ridiculously dreame)
was digd by <HI>Vlysses</HI> when he went downe to parley with those in hell. This is the caue which the
Inhabitants in these dayes call <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llanu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Frugadory,</HI> that is, <HI>The Isle of Purgatory,</HI> and S. <HI>Patricks Par∣gatory:</HI>
for some persons, lesse deuout then credulous, affirme that S. <HI>Patricke</HI> (or rather <HI>Patricius
Secundus</HI> an holy Abbot of that name) labouring the conuersion of the people of this Prouince,
and much inforcing the life to come, they replied contemptuously vnto him, that vnlesse they saw
proofes of those joyes and paines he preached, they would not lose the possession of their present
pleasures, in hope or feare of things to come, they wist not when Whereupon (as they say) he ob∣tained
at Gods hands by earnest prayer, that the punishments and torments which the godlesse are
to suffer after this life, might be there presented to the eye, that so he might more easily root out the
sinnes and Heathenish errours, that stucke so fast in the hearts of the <HI>Irish.</HI> But touching the credit
hereof (although common fame, and some records doe vtter it) I neither will vrge the beliefe,
nor regard, seeing it is no Article of our Creed.</P>
<P>(8) Matters memorable within this Prouince are these: first, that the Bishops of <HI>Ireland</HI> were
wont to be consecrated by the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in regard of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which they had
in this Country; vntill such time as <HI>Iohn Pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> a Cardinall was sent thither from Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Eugenius</HI>
the fourth, to reforme Ecclesiasticall discipline in this <HI>Iland,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that
there were translations, and pluralities of Bishops, according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and pleasure of the Metro∣politane▪
Also that the <HI>Irish-men</HI> were accustomed to leaue and forsake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wedded wiues at their
owne free willes, whereof <HI>Lanfrancke</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> complained vnto <HI>Theraelua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> a King
of <HI>Ireland.</HI> And had not this Nation beene corrupted with this vice, euen vnto these our dayes;
both the right of lineall succession had beene more certaine among them, and the Gentry and
<PB REF="196"/>
Comminaltie had not in such cruelties imbrued themselues, with such effusion of their owne kin∣dreds
bloud, about their inheritances and legitimation.</P>
<P>(9) The principall place in this Tract is <HI>Armagh,</HI> neere vnto the Riuer <HI>Kalin,</HI> which (albeit it
maketh a poore shew) is the <HI>Archiepiscopall See</HI> and <HI>Metropolitane</HI> of the whole Island. Before Saint
<HI>Patricke</HI> had built there a faire Citie, for site, forme, quantitie, and compasse, modelled out (as he
saith) by the appointment and direction of Angels, this place was named <HI>Drumfalrch;</HI> the <HI>Irish</HI> tell
much that it receiued the name of Queene <HI>Armacha:</HI> but the better opinions are, that it is the same
which <HI>Bede</HI> calleth <HI>Dearmach,</HI> and out of the <HI>Scotish</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> language interpreteth it, <HI>The Field of
Oakes.</HI> Here (as S. <HI>Bernard</HI> writeth) S. <HI>Patricke</HI> the Apostle of <HI>Ireland</HI> ruled in his life time, and
rested after death: in honor of whom it was of such venerable estimation in old time, that not one∣ly
Bishops and Priests, but Kings also and Princes were (in generall) subiect to the Metropolitane
thereof in all obedience, and to his gouernment alone. Among the Archbishops of this Prouince,
S. <HI>Malachy</HI> is famoused, who first prohibited Priests marriage in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and (as S. <HI>Bernard</HI> saith,
who wrote his life at large) borrowed no more of the natiue barbarousnesse of that Country, then
<HI>Sea-fishes</HI> doe saltnesse of the Seas. Also <HI>Richard Fitz Ralf</HI> (commonly called <HI>Armachanus)</HI> is of
famous memory, who turning the edge of his stile, about the yeare 1355. began to oppose his opi∣nion
against the Order of <HI>Mendicant Friers,</HI> as detesting in Christians such voluntary begging. The
chiefe Fort in this Tract is <HI>Enis Kelling,</HI> defended by the Rebels in the yeare 1593 and wonne by
<HI>Dowdall</HI> a most valiant Captaine: neere vnto which is a great downfall of water, termed <HI>The Salmon
Leape:</HI> of which there is a common speech currant among the Inhabitants, that it was once firme
ground very populous and well husbanded with tillage; till it was suddenly ouer flowne with wa∣ters,
and turned into a Lake, for some filthy abominable acts of the people against Nature com∣mitted
with beasts.</P>
<P><PB REF="197"/>
(10) The places of Religion, sequestred from other worldly seruices, and consecrated to holy
purposes, erected in this Prouince, were: The Abbey which sheweth it selfe at <HI>Donegal:</HI> The Mona∣stery
of <HI>Derie,</HI> where the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebell <HI>Shane O-N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al</HI> receiued such an ouerthrow (by <HI>Edward Randolph,</HI>
renowned for his seruice in the behalfe of his Country) that he could neuer after recouer the losse he
sustained at that time: The Monastery neere vnto the Riuer <HI>Laffer:</HI> The famous Monastery at the
Bay of <HI>Knockfergus,</HI> of the same institution, name, and order, as was that ancient Abbey in <HI>England,</HI>
neere vnto <HI>Chester,</HI> called <HI>Danchor:</HI> Also <HI>Mellifont</HI> Abbey, founded by <HI>Donald</HI> a King of <HI>Vriel,</HI> and
much commended by S <HI>Bernard:</HI> And lastly, the most renowned Monastery, built at <HI>Armagh</HI> in the
yeare of our Saluation 610. out of which very many Monasteries were afterwards propagate both
in <HI>Britaine</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> These places were farre and neere frequented and sought vnto by great con∣fluences
of <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> till Time proued their deuotions to be erronious, and the pure light of the word
