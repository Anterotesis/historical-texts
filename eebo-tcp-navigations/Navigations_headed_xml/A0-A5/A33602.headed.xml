<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had finished the following Book, I was not long to de∣termin under whose Patronage I should make it publick; your Lord∣ship's Extraordinry Knowledge in all the <HI>British</HI> Antiquities, especially that Part which relates to the <HI>Welch,</HI>
<PB REF="3"/> justly claiming what I now make bold to offer to your Favour. For it seems to be as Natural a Design of a Dedication, to present one's La∣bours to the greatest Judge, as to him who is the greatest Encourager of his Writings; and if so, my Lord, this single Reason would sufficiently ju∣stify me from any Presumption, in submitting the following Papers to your Lordship's Protection. But where the Obligation is corroborated by an equal Engagement; and since your Lordship has been pleased to encourage and promote the Design before it came to any Growth, I hope, I may safely present now in its perfect Strength and Vigor, what you were then pleased to receive in its Infancy.</P>
<P>The History of our Country, my Lord, has been so much neglected, that there seems a very great Neces∣sity of reviving, what to the gene∣rality of the Kingdom, is almost lost;
<PB REF="3"/> and there are too many, otherwise very Learned Persons, nay, some of our own Nation, who are so great Strangers to this Subject, that they are almost ignorant, that there is such a History in being. We have hopes indeed, that from your Lordship's Excelling Knowledge in the <HI>Welch</HI> History, and other <HI>British</HI> Antiqui∣ties, with those Curious Collections, you have with great Labour made towards that Matter, and from others now Travelling the same good Way; we may expect, that the World shall receive such Information relating to our Country, that they who have hitherto despised our History, will be ready to Light that Candle which they now purposely extinguish, and ignorantly undervalue. In the mean time, if by the following History, I can revive the Memories of the seve∣ral Princes therein contained, which in the <HI>English</HI> Histories, are either to∣tally omitted, or but partially inter∣woven,
<PB REF="4"/> and render our History more generally Known, I have my Aim; and especially, since I gain the Op∣portunity of Acknowledging my self,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE History of the <HI>Britains,</HI> may not improperly be distinguished into two Pe∣riods; the former comprehending the interval from <HI>Brute</HI> to <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> whilst the <HI>Britains</HI> are thought to have enjoyed a general Possession of the whole Island; the other contain∣ing the Memoirs and Transactions of the <HI>Bri∣tains,</HI> under their several Princes, after their re∣cession to that part of the Island, since called <HI>Wales.</HI> The former of these has been generally accounted of late, absolutely false and unhistori∣cal; and 'tis undoubtedly concluded that all the Passages in <HI>Geoffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> (the only remaining Monument of the Affairs of the an∣tient <HI>Britains</HI>) which are not consonant to, and agreeable with the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians that speak of <HI>Britain,</HI> are absolutely fabulous and unsincere. The History of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> has indeed met with better fortune, and the Author <HI>Cara∣doc</HI> of <HI>Lhancarvan</HI> is accounted just and au∣thentick; so that there need no other Apology for the following Work, than that it is for the best part the genuine History of that Author. But be∣cause the History of <HI>Wales</HI> has no small depen∣dance upon, and relation to the History of the an∣tient <HI>Britains</HI> published by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> I think it
<PB REF="5"/> necessary to make some general reflection, in rela∣tion to the Truth and Authority of that Copy.</P>
<P>And here in the first place, I must take no∣tice of two sorts of Opinions, most widely repug∣nant, and as I may say, diametrically opposite to each other; and both in my opinion, equally de∣viating from the right apprehension of the mat∣ter in debate. The one, perfectly rejecting the whole foundation and process of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Hi∣story, will not believe so much as one passage re∣lating to the antient <HI>Britains,</HI> but what is deli∣vered by <HI>Roman</HI> Writers; as if nothing remark∣able could happen in <HI>Britain,</HI> but what must needs fall under their special Cognizance and Ob∣servation. The other, without any allowance to the Age when these <HI>British</HI> Affairs were trans∣acted, (not to mention the utmost Antiquity of some part of this History, cotemporary with which, nothing is certain among the more civilized <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>) will believe the whole Frame, and all the Circumstances of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s History, be they never so ridiculous and extravagant. But not to insist on so bigotted an Opinion, as to think that the <HI>British</HI> History is universally true, and altogether authentick; I will confine my self to the examination of the other Extream, to see whe∣ther that History published by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> be so absolutely fabulous as is frequently represented, and generally believed. Now they who discredit this History, either wholly attribute the Frame and Invention of it to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> or else granting him to be a faithful Translator, assure themselves that the Copy he received was fictitious, and perfectly owing to the unwarrantable Forgeries of the fa∣bulous Monks. So that the subject of my present enquiries, will naturally fall under those two
<PB REF="5"/> Disquisitions; <HI>1.</HI> Whether <HI>Geoffrey</HI> be the real Contriver and Composer of this History? And <HI>2ly,</HI> Supposing him to be innocent of this Suspi∣cion, whether the History published by him, be perfectly fabulous, and in all respects a Monkish Legend?</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> As to what relates to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> though me∣thinks there need no greater Argument to evi∣dence his Innocency from so suspected an Impo∣sture, as his being the Contriver of this History, than that be professedly owns the receipt of the <HI>British</HI> Manuscript from <HI>Walter,</HI> Arch Deacon of <HI>Oxford;</HI> yet because the Prejudice of some Men oftentimes obscures their Understanding, in things otherwise very clear and open, it will be requisite to dwell somewhat more particularly up∣on that Subject: or if the World be once per∣swaded, that the whole Invention is owing to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> and that there was no such Account of the <HI>Britains</HI> in being, before he published his, History; the whole series of <HI>British</HI> Affairs not mentioned in the Writings of the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, and all that long continued Succession of <HI>British</HI> Kings for so many Ages, must of necessity be ac∣counted fabulous, and a perfect Legend. But be∣fore that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> should be so unreasonably at∣tainted of such notorious Forgery, and his Histo∣ry be so generally condemned; one might expect that such evident Proofs could be produced to evince so absolute a Position, as to render it past all Dispute and Contradiction. For to charge any one with Insincerity, for no other reason, than because it is the common Vogue and Sentiment of the World, is in my opinion a greater Argument of Partiality and Prejudice, than of solid and ju∣dicious Reasoning.</P>
<PB REF="6"/>
<P>Now the greatest reason that I can think of, why the <HI>British</HI> History is attributed to the in∣vention of <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> is, that almost upon its first appearance in the World, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>New∣borough</HI> and <HI>Geraldus Cambrensis</HI> exclaim a∣gainst it, and seem to lay the whole Imposture to the charge of <HI>Geoffrey.</HI> The words of <HI>Newbo∣rough</HI> are these; <HI>At contra quidem</HI> (speaking before of <HI>Gildas) nostris temporibus pro ex∣piandis his Britonum maculis scriptor emersit, ridicula de iisdem figmenta contexens, eosque longè supra virtutem Macedonum &amp; Roma∣norum impudenti vanitate attollens. Gau∣fridus hic dictus est, Agnomen habens Arturi, pro eo quod fabulas de Arturo ex priscis Bri∣tonum figmentis sumptas, &amp; ex proprio au∣ctas per superductum Latini sermonis Colo∣rem, honesto historiæ nomine palliavit. Qui etiam majori ausu, cujusdam Merlini divina∣tiones fallacissimas, quibus utique de proprio plurimum adjecit, dum eas in Latinum trans∣funderet, tanquam Authenicas, &amp; immobili veritate subnixas prophetias vulgavit.</HI></P>
<P>From this Passage it is apprehended, that <HI>New∣borough</HI> thought that the <HI>British</HI> History was solely owing to the Contrivance and Invention of <HI>Geoffrey;</HI> whereas nothing is more evident, than that the only thing he lays to <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s charge, is, that he augmented, and of his own head made Additions to the Copy he received. And seeing that <HI>Newborough</HI> expresly mentions <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s translating into Latin, some antient Figments of the <HI>Britains</HI> concerning King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and unwarrantably adding to the same; it is ma∣nifestly apparent, that be never took <HI>Geoffrey</HI> to be the Contriver of the whole of what he pub∣lished,
<PB REF="6"/> otherwise it is hardly conceivable, that such an inveterate Enemy of that History, would conceal any thing that might derogate from the Truth and Authority of it. Besides, <HI>Newborough</HI> throughout his whole Preface, wherein be endea∣vours to invallidate, and render the <HI>British</HI> Hi∣story fabulous, chiefly insists upon the Life of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and the Prophecies of <HI>Merlyn;</HI> not a word of <HI>Brutus</HI> and his <HI>Trojans,</HI> which, thô <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince accounted as notorious a piece of Romance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s any at all; it seems he had Faith to swallow. Indeed, the Passages in King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Life, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Prophecies of <HI>Merlyn</HI> tending much to the same purpose, were too great and extravagant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be credited by him, (who by his Character of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, seems to have bore but very slender Affe∣ction towards the <HI>Welch</HI>) by reason that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erogated much from the Fame and Valour of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Saxons;</HI> so that I am afraid, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dium which <HI>Newborough</HI> bore to <HI>Geoffrey</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd his History, depended more upon National Honour and Reputation, than the Truth and Sin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erity of History. For surely he could never be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> warmly exasperated against a fabulous History, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad he but the Candor to consult his own, unless here had been some other motive to raise and fo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent his Passion. As to the scurrilous Language <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e casts upon the <HI>British</HI> History, and his un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annerly treatment of the Translator; he therein <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpresses his Ignorance and Malice, rather than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Love and Regard to Truth and Ingenuity, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or who but an ignorant and an unskilful Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nder, would confidently assert the <HI>Britains</HI> never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d any Metropolitans or Archbishops, and would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oduce this as an invincible Argument for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lsity of the <HI>British</HI> History; whereas it is no∣toriously
<PB REF="7" MS="y"/> manifest, that the <HI>Britains</HI> had their Arch∣bishops long before the arrival of <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk, whom <HI>Newborough</HI> pretends to have been the first who underwent that Dignity in this Island. But as his Arguments against <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s History are weak and invalid, and his whole Preface more an Invective than a Confutation, so his Credit should be rejected and undervalued, for charging another History with falshood, when his own seems wholly interwoven with ridiculous Legends and Monkish Fictions.</P>
<P>But be the occasion of <HI>Newborough</HI>'s dislike of the <HI>British</HI> History what it will, 'tis evident, that nothing can be concluded from the above quoted Passage, more than that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> made Additions to the <HI>British</HI> Copy be received of the Archdeacon of <HI>Oxford.</HI> And this is no more than what may ea∣sily and safely be granted; for the Life of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and the Prophecies of <HI>Merlyn,</HI> the main Subjects of <HI>Newborough</HI>'s Discontent, may proba∣bly be inserted into the History by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> at least they were augmented, and several Traditions were added by him. <HI>Bale,</HI> assures us, that he writ the Life of King <HI>Arthur</HI> in a distinct Treatise and himself owns in the Preface to his fourth Book, which comprehends the Prophecies of <HI>Merlyn,</HI> that upon the Request of <HI>Alexander</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> he had translated <HI>Merlyn</HI>'s Prophecies out of <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> into <HI>Latin,</HI> before the <HI>British</HI> Copy came to his Hands. Now, when <HI>Geoffrey</HI> had received the Manuscript from the Archdeacon, and was engaged in translating it into <HI>Latin,</HI> 'tis no strange matter to imagine, that as occasion required, he might am∣plify, and add to it, out of his former Tracts. F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it is obvious to suppose, that the several things con∣cerning <HI>Arthur</HI> and <HI>Merlyn,</HI> might be preserue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="7"/> in the Island of great <HI>Britain,</HI> which were long ago obsolete among the <HI>Britains</HI> of <HI>Armorica,</HI> from whence the <HI>British</HI> Copy is said to have been brought over.</P>
<P>But supposing that <HI>Newborough</HI> had attributed the whole Frame of the <HI>British</HI> History to <HI>Geof∣frey,</HI> which is evident he does not, his Authority cannot ballance with far more authentic Historians, such as <HI>H. Huntington, R. Hovedon, Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> and others, but more particularly <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> who in express Terms, calls <HI>Geoffrey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad Ann. <HI>1151.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The Faithful Translator of the</HI> British <HI>History.</HI> And seeing then, that it was in those times ap∣prehended to be an antient Manuscript, and none of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Contrivance, when the Cheat might he best discovered, and there wanted not good Incli∣nations to detect so notorious a Forgery; how in these latter times, it could be so luckily found out, that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> was the sole Inventor and Composer of the History, I cannot possibly divine.</P>
<P>The other Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camb. <HI>Descript. Cap.</HI> 7.</NOTE> why <HI>Geoffrey</HI> is thought to be the Author of the <HI>British</HI> History, is grounded upon a Passage in <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis,</HI> who speaking of the Etymology of <HI>Wales,</HI> rejects the Denomination of it from either Duke <HI>Wallo,</HI> or Queen <HI>Wendolen, sicut fabulosa Galfredi Arturi mentitur Historia.</HI> Now this is thought an invicible Argument against <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> and a palpable detection of his insincerity, since <HI>Giraldus,</HI> his own Country-man strikes at him, and accuses him of Forgery; whereas upon nicer examination, we may easily discover how that <HI>Gi∣raldus</HI> quarrels only with the History which <HI>Geof∣frey</HI> published, and which upon that account bore his Name. For had <HI>Giraldus</HI> though it to be only a Contrivance of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s, had he suspected that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> falsly pretended to have received an
<PB REF="8"/> antient <HI>British</HI> Manuscript, and by that means to have imposed upon the World; Can it be supposed that upon so plain Conviction of falshood, he would believe and give Credit to an History, which he was satisfied was altogether a Fable? But on the con∣trary, we find him assenting to the Story of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and the division of the Island betwixt his three Sons; and in short, excepting in this one place, he expresses himself to be an absolute Votary of the <HI>British</HI> History, whence 'tis evident, he apprehended <HI>Geoffrey</HI> to be no more than a faithful Translator of an antient <HI>British</HI> Copy.</P>
<P>I need not take notice of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> because that by the best account, he is supposed to have been dead before <HI>Geoffrey</HI> published his Hi∣story, and consequently he could never see it; so that this Expression in him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> I.</NOTE> <HI>Hic est Arthurus de quo Britonum Nuge hodicque delirant,</HI> must likely refer to the then present Traditions and Accounts of the <HI>Welch</HI> concerning King <HI>Arthur,</HI> which proba∣bly might be too great and extravagant. For 'tis certain that a traditional Account of any Person or Action, the farther it recedes from the Spring and Original, the more corrupt and imperfect it still pro∣ceeds; and like a Ball of Snow, it gathers and aug∣ments in its journey; so that it may be reasonably supposed, that the vulgar Account which the <HI>Welch</HI> in <HI>Malmsbury</HI>'s time delivered of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> was too far incredible and surprising.</P>
<P>But since the Reasons produced for proving <HI>Geof∣frey</HI> to be the Author of the <HI>British</HI> History, seem not to be satisfactory and evincing; let us see whether the contrary assertion can be more reason∣ably maintained. And first, 'tis manifest that <HI>Geof∣frey</HI> could not be the total Inventor of the <HI>British</HI> History, by reason that several things, and some of
<PB REF="8"/> the most material Passages therein contained, are agreeable with the Histories of <HI>Gildas</HI> and <HI>Nen∣nius,</HI> the Poetical Fragments of <HI>Taliessyn,</HI> not to mention the <HI>Saxon</HI> Manuscript,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notes up∣on <HI>Bede.</HI></NOTE> quoted by Mr. <HI>Whee∣lock,</HI> and other Authors far more antient than <HI>Geof∣frey.</HI> 'Tis owned indeed <HI>Geoffrey</HI> might borrow the ground and Plat-form of his Romance from <HI>Merlyn</HI> or <HI>Taliessyn,</HI> or rather from <HI>Nennius,</HI> in whose Writings there is some slight Account of the <HI>Britains</HI> being descended from the <HI>Trojans;</HI> but the superstructure is all his own, who living in an ignorant Age, and well knowing he could not well be disproved, took the Liberty to make what Inven∣tion he pleased, and then recommended it to the World, for a true, undoubted History. But not∣withstanding all this concession, I think there is as little reason to attribute the Frame and Compo∣sition of this History to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> as there can be, to think him Contriver of the Ground and Plot of it. For it seems to me very unaccountable, that if <HI>Geoffrey</HI> was to invent and compose this History, why in this account of the Transactions betwixt the <HI>Britains</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> he should so widely disagree with, and deviate from the Writings of the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians. For certainly, nothing could add more Authority to a Fable, than exactly to fol∣low the steps of creditable Authors, in those things they both had occasion to treat of. This in all pro∣bability, would not only render that part of the Hi∣story unsuspicious, but likewise Credit and Autho∣rize the rest, of which there was no account in <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Authors. And this disagreement betwixt the <HI>British</HI> History, and the Writings of the Roman Historians, tho' frequently produced to overthrow the Authority of it, induces me to believe, not only that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> was not the Author, but likewise that the
<PB REF="9"/> Manuscript was antient, and much elder than the time, in which it was first made publick.</P>
<P>But besides, <HI>Geoffrey</HI> dedicates his Translation to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> Son to King <HI>Henry</HI> the First, which in all likelihood he would never have ventured to do, had the Original been of his own Contrivance, for fear least that the Cheat being dis∣covered, he should be found, to put upon a Person of Eminent Quality, with whom the <HI>British</HI> History was then in great Esteem. For to him it is that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> owns the Receipt of this Manuscript from the Archdeacon of <HI>Oxford,</HI> which he affirms to be very antient, and by his Request was persuaded to translate it into the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue. It was a very easie matter for the Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> to find out <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Integrity, by enquiring of the Archdeacon (who by all Accounts is reckoned his co-temporary) whether he had delivered such an antient <HI>British</HI> Copy into <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s hands, and whether the Tran∣slation justly answered the Original. These Enquiries were natural, upon the publication of any new Hi∣story, which made such considerable noise and cla∣mour in the World, and which gave such an Ac∣count of the antient <HI>Britains,</HI> as was never before thought or heard of among the <HI>English</HI> Nation. And supposing the Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> to have omitted these Enquiries, yet it is scarce conceivable, but that in case of so open a Forgery, the Archdeacon would discover the Cheat, unless it can be thought that he was privy to, and had a hand in the Contrivance. But he was so far from detecting <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Impo∣sture, that he himself owns too, to have translated the <HI>British</HI> History first into <HI>Latin,</HI> and then in his latter days, to <HI>British</HI> again from the <HI>Latin,</HI> as may he still seen in the <HI>Archives</HI> of <HI>Jesus</HI>-College Li∣brary. Now if there be any heed to, or dependance upon
<PB REF="9"/> this, if it be true, that the Archdeacon did tran∣slate, and consequently allow of this History, it ap∣pears very evident to me, that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> can be in no wise the Author or Contriver of it.</P>
<P>But that <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Glocester</HI> took a fancy to <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Translation, more upon the account that his Father had lately subdued the <HI>Welch,</HI> and therefore seemed to add to his Father's Glory, than that he did credit and believe the History, does not seem to be so true and evincing. For wherein could the publication of this History contribute to the advance∣ment of his Father's Name? Was it because he had Conquered a People, whose Ancestors appeared by this History, to be formerly Valiant and War∣like? This was performed by others before him, and I can conceive no great addition to any Man's Fame, to Conquer a handful of People with a numerous Army, tho' their Fore-fathers had been Stout and Victorious. This is surely too slight a Pretence for the reception of the <HI>British</HI> History by the Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and too weak an Argument to destroy the Truth and Authority of it. 'Tis certain, that it took exceeding well in the World at that time, nor was it opposed till after <HI>Robert</HI>'s Death, when <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Newborough</HI> more out of Malice and Discontent, than any Love he bore to Truth, began to charge both the Original and Translator with insincerity. I cannot see, upon the whole, the least Reason, why the Contrivance and Invention of this History should he attributed to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> or that the Authority of it depends any way upon him, more than the Fide∣lity of his Translation. I shall therefore conclude this Subject with the Character bestowed upon <HI>Geof∣frey,</HI> and the History by him published by <HI>Ponticus Virunnius,</HI> who flourished in the Year <HI>1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>90.</HI> a Man of great Reading, and excellent Learning of his time, who did not think it lost Labour to draw an Epitome of the <HI>British</HI> History: <HI>Giraldus</HI> (says
<PB REF="10"/> he) <HI>Historicus egregius &amp; Cardinalis, magnæ vir auctoritatis apud Robertum Claudiocestriæ Ducem, Henrici Regis filium, ac patriæ suae cu∣riosissimus Fautor, ex summâ Philosophiâ atque Archivis, Historiam antiquissimam continuâ serie ab ipsis Trojanis collectam transtulit. Verissimas esse Britannorum Historias arguit Regum Occiden∣talium consuetudo; quæ erat, secum semper habere eos, qui veritate præcipua eorum gesta notarent.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> But supposing <HI>Geoffrey</HI> to be innocent from this suspected Imposture, and that he did no more than faithfully translate a <HI>British</HI> Manuscript he received of the Archdeacon; it may be farther ob∣jected, that seeing it abounds with so many unwar∣rantable matters of fact, and so extravagant Fables and Prodigies, it appears extreamly suspicious, and sensibly smells of a Monkish production. For how is it possible, you will say, that any Account, ex∣cepting what is found in the <HI>Roman</HI> Histories, could be had of the <HI>Britains,</HI> and that not only before, but even after their subjection to the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> since there is much reason to doubt, whe∣ther the <HI>Britains,</HI> as well as other unlattered Na∣tions, had any means to convey any Knowledge to Posterity, for want of the Art of Writing? For if the Affairs and Transactions of the <HI>Britains</HI> were only handed down by Tradition, and they had no other way or method to preserve their Memories, then certainly all Pretences to antient Records, and con∣sequently to this <HI>British</HI> Manuscript, supposed to have been translated by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> must of necessity be vain and groundless.</P>
<P>And thus it is supposed, that the <HI>Britains</HI> had no Writing among them, neither before nor after the <HI>Roman</HI> Conquest; whence it follows, that there is no true nor certain account of any matter translated among them, but what is recorded in <HI>Roman</HI> Hi∣stories. But tho' this be frequently insinuated, yet I
<PB REF="10"/> think, the contrary can with greater ease and per∣spicuity, be made to appear. As to the <HI>Britains</HI> having no Writing among them, during their sub∣jection to the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the contrary is so evident and notorious, that I conceive it lost time to go about to disprove it. 'Tis sufficient to lay down the Words of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> an Author of un∣shaken Reputation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vita A∣gric.</NOTE> <HI>Jam verò Principum filios liberalibus Artibus erudire, &amp; ingenia Britanno∣rum studiis Gallorum ante<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erre, &amp; qui modò linguam Romanorum abnuebant, eloquentiam concupiscerent.

And can we imagine, that among so many Able and Learned Persons, as the <HI>Britains</HI> must in reason be, when educated in the <HI>Roman</HI> way, and owned to be very tractable in their Edu∣cation, not one should prove so affectionate to his Country, as to note down the State and Transaction<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it? Certainly, if they learne all the Civilities and Sciences of the <HI>Romans,</HI> History was not so slight and trivial a subject of their Industry, as to be undervalued; and I know not where they could better employ their Skill, than in Writing the Hi∣story of their Native Country. It was natural for them being once civilized, to enquire into the Origine and Antiquity of their Nation, the State and Con∣dition of their Country before the <HI>Roman</HI> Conquest, and having made the best search they could, whether by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral or written Tradition into these Enquiries, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould in all reason, according to the Custom and
<PB REF="11"/> manner of the <HI>Romans,</HI> commit all to Writing.</P>
<P>But allowing the <HI>Britains</HI> to haue learnt the Art of Writing from the <HI>Romans,</HI> after their subjection to the Empire, yet 'tis certain they had no such thing among them, before the discovery of this Island by <HI>Julius Cæsar,</HI> and consequently, that all the former Part of the <HI>British</HI> History which precides that E∣poch, must be false and fictitious. And that this is no precarious Objection, a Passage <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Cæsar</HI>'s Commentaries is produced to strengthen it, which in my Opinion, evidently proves the contrary. The Words of <HI>Cæsar</HI> are these:<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Bell. Gall. <HI>Lib.</HI> VI.</NOTE> <HI>Magnum ibi nume∣rum</HI> (speaking of the <HI>Druids) versuum ediscere dicuntur, itaque annoe nonnulli viceno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in disci∣plina permanent; neque fas esse existimant ca literis mandare, c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m in reliquis ferè rebus, pub∣licis-privatisque rationibus, Graecis literis utuntur.</HI> Why any one from hence should conclude, that the Superstition of those antient Philosophers the <HI>Druids,</HI> forbad the <HI>Britains</HI> to commit to Writing the Trans∣actions of their Country, much more that they had no Writing at all among them, does I confess, very far exceed my comprehension. <HI>Cæsar,</HI> truly does intimate, that the Doctrine and Mysteries of their Religion, the <HI>Druids</HI> did not think fit to commit to Writing but in all Matters besides, whether pri∣vate or publick (among which History, may be rea∣sonably accounted) they used the <HI>Greek</HI> Characters for so I understand those words, <HI>Graecis literis u∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tur.</HI> For it may not be supposed that all publick and private Affairs of the <HI>Britains</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nslated in <HI>Greek,</HI> when they had a different Language of their own, and which in all reason must be th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> common Tongue of the Country; but only that when the <HI>Britains</HI> had occasion to put any thing in Wri∣ting they used the <HI>Grecian</HI> Character, which pro∣bably was the only Letter, they then were acquainted with. But to confirm this matter the more, <HI>Cæsar</HI>
<PB REF="11"/> makes mention of the like Custom among the <HI>Gauls; In castris Helvetiorum tabulae repertee sunt literis Graecis confectae.</HI> Now if he concluded from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. I.</NOTE> that the <HI>Gauls</HI> (for the <HI>Helvetians</HI> were a <HI>Gaulish</HI> People) made use of the <HI>Greek</HI> Language, rather than the <HI>Grecian</HI> Characters; I would fain be in∣formed, why <HI>Cæsar</HI> should write in <HI>Greek</HI> to Quintus Cicero, <HI>Ne interceptâ Epistolâ suâ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. V.</NOTE> <HI>à Gallis consilia noscerentur;</HI> lest that his Letter being intercepted, all his measures and martial In∣trigues, be discovered by the <HI>Gauls.</HI> Certainly, if he had known (as well he might, in case the <HI>Hel∣vetians</HI> understood, and writ in <HI>Greek</HI>) that the <HI>Gauls</HI> were not ignorant of the <HI>Greek</HI> Language, he would not make use of so mean a stratagem to conceal his Counsels. But suppose it be acknowledged that the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Britains</HI> used, not only the <HI>Greek</HI> Characters, but the Language too (one of which must be allowed) 'tis evident that they had the Art and use of Writing, before <HI>Cæsar</HI> made any Inva∣sion to either Country, and consequently the <HI>Britains</HI> might have some written memorials of their Country, which might be afterwards easily handed down to Posterity. For it seems to me very strange, that Men of such reputed Learning and Knowledge, and so well versed in the Mysteries of Philosophy, as the <HI>Druids</HI> are acknowledged to have been, should be ignorant of so necessary and useful a Qualification, as Writing. And since 'tis affirmed, that their Re∣ligions Superstitions were interdicted to be committed to Writing, we may rationally conclude, by the Rule of contrariety, that all other things besides their Re∣ligion, were allowed to be written, and consequent∣ly, that they had the Art and Ʋse of Writing a∣mong them.</P>
<P>But supposing the <HI>Britains</HI> to have recorded the Transactions of their Country, both before and after be <HI>Roman</HI> Conquest, yet when the <HI>Saxons</HI> prevail∣ed
<PB REF="12"/> in the Island, all the Monuments and Writings of the antient <HI>Britains</HI> were utterly lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> so that this pretended History of the <HI>Britains,</HI> must be mo∣dern and fabulous, built upon vulgar and uncer∣tain Traditions. For how was it possible that any one could write a true and a faithful Account of the antient <HI>Britains,</HI> and be so particular in the Transactions of those times, whenas there was not the least Light to guide him to the Knowledge of those obscure Ages. This is expresly acknowledged by <HI>Gildas,</HI> who lived long before <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> and openly declares, that all the Records and Monuments of his Country were lost in his time; and that in writing those small Fragments of the History of <HI>Britain,</HI> he was forced to abstract his Materials out of the Writings of Foreigners.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excid.

<P>I shall here by the by, observe the levity of <HI>Aylet Sames</HI>'s Objection against the History of <HI>Brute;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Britan. <HI>p.</HI> 158.</NOTE> namely, because <HI>Gildas</HI> makes no mention of <HI>Brute</HI> and his <HI>Trojans,</HI> he concludes that the <HI>British</HI> History must be a real Fiction; whereas <HI>Gildos</HI> in this place manifestly declares his design only of wri∣ting the History of the <HI>Britains,</HI> during their sub∣jection to the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. But as to this pas∣sage in <HI>Gildas,</HI> if in his time, there were no re∣mains of his Ancestors left in writing; I would fain learn upon what Ground and Authority, he could so positively assert that the <HI>Britains</HI> from their first Plantation in this Island, were proud and irre∣ligious,
<PB REF="12"/> and their Kings cruel and tyrannical. For a little before the above quoted passage, he says of Britain, <HI>Hæc erecta Cervice &amp; mente ex quo inhabitata est, nunc Deo, interdum Civibus, nonnunquam etiam transmarinis Regibus ingra∣ta consurgit.</HI> And a little after, <HI>Tacens vetu∣stos immanium Tyrannorum annos, qui in aliis pofitis regionibus vulgati sunt.</HI> Here he passes his Judgment very liberally upon the State and Condition of <HI>Britain</HI> from all Antiquity; and yet by and by, be confesses, that he had no guide to direct him to the Knowledge of those times he so freely censures; so that if he had not the Spirit of Divination, he may falter in his conjectures, or else he was guided by some <HI>British</HI> Light, of which he was not willing to own the perusal.</P>
<P>But allowing that <HI>Gildas,</HI> in composing that small Fragment of the <HI>British</HI> History, received no Light from any <HI>British</HI> Record, but was constrained to borrow out of the Writings of Foreigners; it con∣cludes no farther, than that he had not the good Fortune to meet with <HI>British</HI> Manuscripts, not that there were none really remaining in <HI>Britain.</HI> And farther, supposing that in <HI>Gildas</HI> his time, there were no remains of the antient <HI>Britains</HI> left in this Island, but were all utterly lost; yet according to <HI>Gildas</HI> his own acknowledgment, and upon the <HI>Saxons</HI> prevailing in the Country, they might be carried over by the exuled <HI>Britains</HI> to <HI>Armories,</HI> from whence the Archdeacon of <HI>Oxford</HI> is said to have brought over the <HI>British</HI> Copy be delivered to <HI>Geoffrey.</HI> But if there was no written Account of the former State of <HI>Britain,</HI> in the Age of <HI>Gil∣das,</HI> how comes it to pass, that any such thing should be discovered and brought to light in succeed∣ing Ages. And not to insist upon the Authority of the <HI>British</HI> Manuscript translated by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> we have good reason to presume, that the antient <HI>Britains</HI>
<PB REF="13"/> before <HI>Gildas</HI> had hath Ecclesiastical and Civil Hi∣stories of their Country.</P>
<P>As to the former, <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de,</HI> whose Authority I pre∣sume, will not be questioned, expresly affirmed it. For in his Preface to his <HI>Ecclesiastical History,</HI> he says, <HI>A principio itaque Voluminis hujus, usque ad tempus quo Gens Anglorum fidem Christi percepit, ex priorum maxime scriptis hinc inde collectis, ea quæ promemoramus, didiscimus.</HI> Here <HI>Bede</HI> plainly declares, that in Writing a Church History of <HI>Britain,</HI> he extracted all his matter, before the conversion of the <HI>Saxons</HI> to Chri∣stianity, out of antient Authors. But who can these former Writers be? Surely they were not <HI>Saxons,</HI> for we read of no <HI>Saxon</HI> Writer before <HI>Bede;</HI> besides, that several things contained in this Hi∣story, were translated before the Landing of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and as to the Ecclesiastical part, betwixt the arrival and the conuersion of the <HI>Saxons</HI> to Christianity that cannot be extracted out of their Writings. For in the first place they were no Christians, and it is very unreasonable to suppose, that they would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the History of a Church, of which they were at that time very fatal and implacable. Euen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s; not to question, whether the <HI>Saxons</HI> before their Conuersion had any Writing or Learning at all among them. For though it be pretended, that the <HI>Irish,</HI> who use the same manner of Writing, borrowed their Characters from the <HI>Saxons;</HI> yet 'tis extremely suspitious, that these received them from the <HI>Irish,</HI> if not ra∣ther from the <HI>Britains.</HI> As to the former, it is well known, that during the Disturbances betwixt the <HI>Britains</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> here in <HI>Britain,</HI> the In∣cursions of the <HI>Goths, Vandals,</HI> and other Nor∣thern Nations into other Countries; all the Learn∣ing of these Western Parts of the World, fled into <HI>Ireland,</HI> which for a considerable time remained
<PB REF="13"/> to be the Nursery of Learning and learned Men.</P>
<P>And that the <HI>Saxons,</HI> long after their Conver∣sion to Christianity, retired to <HI>Ireland</HI> for this pur∣pose, we have the Testimony of their antient and most authentick Historian; so that, I think,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bed. Hist. Eccl. lib. 3. chap. 27.</NOTE> 'tis no Presumption to suspect, that as the <HI>Saxons</HI> borrowed their Learning from the <HI>Irish,</HI> they might for the same reason, receive their Characters and form of writing from them. But 'tis again to be doubted, whether both the <HI>Saxons</HI> and the <HI>Irish</HI> did not primarily derive their Characters from the <HI>Britains:</HI> For though the British Language <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he now writ in a different Character from the <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Saxon,</HI> yet upon antient <HI>British</HI> Mo∣numents and Inscriptions, most of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Let∣ters, different from the present <HI>Roman</HI> Alphabet, are plainly to be seen. Nor was this Character originally <HI>British,</HI> the same being used in the first Age of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Re Di∣plo. p. 345.</NOTE> if we can lay any stress on <HI>Julius Cesar</HI>'s Will and Testament, re∣presented by <HI>Mabillon.</HI> But farther yet; if the <HI>Irish</HI> Character be originally <HI>Saxon,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> must either bring it along with them from <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> or else they must have invented it after their arrival and settlement in <HI>Britain:</HI> If the first, it may seem wonderful, how it came to be quite lost and forgotten in all parts of <HI>Germany;</HI> unlese we can suppose, that it was limited only to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and that they to a Man came and settled in this Island: For no body can be ig∣norant, that not only the <HI>Germans,</HI> but the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> too, use the <HI>Latine</HI> Cha∣racter; which, if we suppose them to have but lately borrowed, yet in all probability, their for∣mer Letter was <HI>Gothick</HI> or <HI>Runick,</HI> to which the <HI>Saxon</HI> bears no great resemblance. But if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t be said, that the <HI>Saxons</HI> invented this Chara∣cter after their coming to <HI>Britain;</HI> I cannot well
<PB REF="14"/> conceive, why they should put themselves to such un∣necessary trouble, when with far greater ease and facility they might copy and borrow from the <HI>Bri∣tains;</HI> unless the odium betwixt both Nations made them scorn to ape and imitate an Enemy. But be it so, that the <HI>Saxons</HI> invented this Character in <HI>Britain;</HI> it will follow, that they had no Letters nor Learning before they came over; and consequent∣ly, that these Authors which <HI>Bede</HI> mentions to have transcribed out of, could not be <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>As to the civil part of the <HI>British</HI> History, that the Transactions of State were recorded, and that Copies thereof came to the hands of Posterity, we have the express Testimony of <HI>Nennius,</HI> who flou∣rished about Three Hundred Years after <HI>Gildas</HI> For in his Preface to his History of the <HI>Britains,</HI> he openly declares, that he compos'd his History, <HI>Partim majorum Traditionibus, partim Scri∣ptis, partim etiam Monumentis veterum Bri∣tanniae Incolarum.</HI> Here <HI>Nennius</HI> says, that he partly extracted his History out of the Writings of the Antient <HI>Britains.</HI> And what could these Writings be? Certainly, they were not the Works of <HI>Gildas,</HI> the only <HI>British</HI> Author we read of before <HI>Nennius;</HI> upon the account that the History of <HI>Nennius</HI> is much larger, and far more com∣plete than that of <HI>Gildas;</HI> this latter, besides the Names of a few <HI>British</HI> Kings, having left no∣thing Historical to Posteritty; the main, it seems of his design being to rail, and to inveigh against his Countrey, to which he had taken some Dis∣pleasure. From whence then else could <HI>Nennius</HI> extract the Materials of his History? Why, 'tis reasonable to suppose, that from some <HI>British</HI> Re∣cords, which possibly might be recovered since the time of <HI>Gildas;</HI> And if then, why might not more be discovered since <HI>Nennius,</HI> and that delivered to <HI>Geoffrey</HI> by the Arch-Deacon of <HI>Oxon,</HI> be one?</P>
<PB REF="14"/>
<P>But besides, That the <HI>Britains</HI> kept Memorials of their Transactions, we may rationally gather from the Constitution and Profession of the <HI>Bards. Diodorus Siculus</HI> says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; The <HI>Bards</HI> singing to an Instrument like a Harp, re∣peat the Praises and Commendations of some, the Faults and Dispraises of others. And in like manner <HI>Marcellinus;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Bardi quidem fortia virocum illustrium facta heroicis composita ver∣sibus, cum dulcibus lyræ modulis cantitarunt.</HI> And above the rest <HI>Lucan;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pharsal. lib. 1.</NOTE>
<Q><L>Vos quoque qui fortes Animas, belloque peremptas</L>
<L>Landious in longum vates emittitis aevum,</L>
<L>Plutima securi fudistis Carmina Bardi.</L></Q></P>
<P>But that the <HI>Bards</HI> did not only commit to memory the famous Deeds of their Princes and Heroes, and so recite and repeat them upon oc∣casions; but also that they wrote down and re∣corded what they repeated, we have the ample Testimony of <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambr. Descrip. cap. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Hoc etiam mild notandum videtur, quòd Bardi Cambren∣ses, &amp; Cantatores seu Recitatores, genealo∣giam habent Prædictorum Principum in libris eorum antiquis &amp; authenticis, sed tamen Cam∣brice scriptam, eandémque memoriter tenent à Roderico Magno usque ad Belinum mag∣num, &amp; inde usque ad Silvium, Ascanium, &amp; Æneam; &amp; ab Æneâ usque ad Adam, Generationem linealiter producunt.</HI></P>
<P>Now that the Genealogies here mentioned by <HI>Giraldus,</HI> were not only a bare account of the several Descents and Successions of the <HI>British</HI> Kings, but also some Memorials of their Lives and Actions, may be easily gathered from the above∣said Manners and Customs of the <HI>Bards.</HI> And seeing these <HI>Bards</HI> did preserve not only in Memory but in Writing too, the lineal Succession
<PB REF="15"/> and most famous Transactions of their Kings; I see no reason why the History of <HI>Geoffrey</HI> may not, as to a great part of it, pretend to greater Authority than is generally attributed to it. And if it be objected, that the <HI>Bards,</HI> by a Poetical Liberty out did the Truth of History, in the Praises of those Princes they were to celebrate; yet thus far it may reasonably be acknowledged, that the Names and Succession of the several Kings are real, and consequently that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> could never be the Inventer of so large a List of Nick-Names, as he is generally thought to be. For it is very pro∣bable, that the History of the <HI>Britains</HI> transla∣ted by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> was composed partly out of these Genealogies peculiar to the <HI>Bards,</HI> and partly out of any other Records and Monuments of the <HI>Britains;</HI> both which I have shewn to have been preserved, and used among them antiently.</P>
<P>But to descend to the particulars of this Histo∣ry, the first and most suspicious Relation, is that of the landing of <HI>Brute</HI> with a Colony of <HI>Tro∣jans,</HI> the several Crosses and Encounters he sustain∣ed in his Voyage; and then of this Island receiv∣ing its Name from him. Should we indeed re∣flect upon the particular Circumstances of this Sto∣ry, we might upon good reason be satisfied of the Vanity and falseness of them; but therefore to conclude, that because the Building is suspicious, the Foundation consequently must be fabulous, and a perfect Contrivance; does, I think, deserve some better Examination: For if we do but reflect upon the contemporary Histories of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> those more polite and literate Nations, we may with equal pretence of Reason affirm, that there is no foundation for any matter of Fact be∣fore the Olympiads; or that the relation of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s coming to <HI>Italy,</HI> and all that History, to the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> are altogether groundless and
<PB REF="15"/> impertinent, because they are intermixt with Fa∣bles and impossibilities. <HI>Livy</HI> assures us, that all the Transactions before the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> are rather owing to Poetical Fancy and Extra∣vagancies, than to any true and certain Matter of Fact; and therefore be declin'd to give either his Assent or Dissent, to any thing related of those Times:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Praefat.</NOTE> <HI>Quæ ante conditam condendamve Ur∣bem, poeticis magis decora fabulis, quam in∣corruptis rerum gestarum monumentis tradun∣tur, ea nec affirmare, nec refellere in animo est.</HI> And <HI>Plutarch</HI> goes farther, and tells us, that the Original and Etymology of <HI>Rome,</HI> that famous City, so well known afterwards over all the World, could not be agreed upon among the di∣versity of Authors, and consequently must be very ob∣scure and uncertain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vita Rom.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>But for all their own Historians do allow that the History of those Times are fabulous and un∣certain; yet there are none that question the being of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and that the <HI>Romans</HI> were descen∣ded from him. The like may be urged for the History of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and the landing of the <HI>Trojans</HI> in this Island; that though many particular Cir∣cumstances are fabulous, and entirely poetical, yet it does not thence necessarily follow, that there is no manner of ground or foundation for such a Relation. Neither is it sufficient Conviction, to urge, that the very being of <HI>Brute</HI> is all a Fi∣ction, by reason that the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians make no mention of such a Person to be the Son of <HI>Sil∣vius;</HI> because, that through the whole Succession from <HI>Aeneas</HI> to <HI>Romulus,</HI> the Histories of those Times take notice only of the Son that was to suc∣ceed; it being unreasonable to suppose, that all the Kings of <HI>Latium</HI> during that period, should be∣get
<PB REF="16"/> each of them, but one Son. And there∣fore, what by the obscurity of those Ages, and what by bearing regard only to the Line of Suc∣cession, many collateral Princes escaped the Cog∣nizance of future Historians. Nor is it enough to affirm, that the History of <HI>Brute</HI> is but lately known and discovered to the World, whereas the fabulous <HI>Roman</HI> History has been recorded from Antiquity; because, that though we are not cer∣tain that the <HI>British</HI> History has been handed down to Posterity in Writing; yet we are sure, that it was an antient Tradition, long before <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s publishing of it; and one should think, that an antient National Tradition, might require a stricter Examination, than hastily to throw it aside, as fabulous and of no Consequence.</P>
<P>But the Question is not, Whether the <HI>British</HI> History, as related by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> be, as to all the Circumstances of it, true and real Matter of Fact; for that, no Man, I presume, can reasona∣bly maintain; but whether there be any ground or foundation of Truth couched under these Poe∣tical and fabulous Narratives. Now the first thing we meet with in the <HI>British</HI> History, is, an Account of <HI>Brutus</HI> his Pedigree, how he was descended from the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and having acciden∣tally slain his Father <HI>Silvius,</HI> how he was forced to flee into <HI>Greece,</HI> whence, after several Scuf∣fles with <HI>Pendrasus,</HI> a petty Prince of that Coun∣try, he thought fit to retire, and to seek his For∣tune by Sea. But he had not wandered long, when he met with <HI>Corinaeus,</HI> with another Par∣ty of desolate <HI>Trojans,</HI> with whom having joyn∣ed his Forces, he followed the Counsel of the Oracle, and at last arrives in this Island, from him afterwards called <HI>Britain.</HI> Now as to the particular Circumstances related in the Life of <HI>Brutus,</HI> they may properly be placed in the same
<PB REF="16"/> Class with <HI>Homer</HI>'s account of the Travels of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Description of <HI>Aeneas</HI> his Ad∣venture to <HI>Italy;</HI> that is to say, that they are Poe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ical Fictions, and perfectly consonant to the humour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f that fabulous Age. But the Question in hand will be, whether there be any probability for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>round of this Story, that <HI>Brute</HI> should bring over a Colony of <HI>Trojans,</HI> and seat himself in this Island. Now what is most materially urged against it, is the Novelty of this Discourse, that none of the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians make the least mention of such a Person as <HI>Brutus;</HI> and that <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who seem to have enquired more narrowly into the Original of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Britains,</HI> found no such Tradition in their time; otherwise in giving their opinion whence the <HI>Bri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ains</HI> were derived, they would never have omit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed such an antient National Tradition, of their being descended from the <HI>Trojans.</HI> Besides, that <HI>Gildas,</HI> who was a <HI>Britain,</HI> takes no notice of such a Tradition, which in all probability be would ne∣ver have omitted, had there been such an account of their Origine in his time.</P>
<P>As to what is objected against the Antiquity of this Tradition, is certainly very erroneous; for 'tis so far from being first known to the World, at the publication of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s History, that <HI>Nennius,</HI> long before that time, and <HI>Merlyn,</HI> much antienter then he, speak of the <HI>Britains</HI> being descended from <HI>Troy.</HI> Nay the <HI>Saxons</HI> themselves before <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> were not unacquainted with this Tradition, as plain∣ly appears, from the antient <HI>Saxon</HI> Poet, mention'd by Mr. <HI>Wheelock,</HI> whom he thus translates;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notes on <HI>Bede.</HI></NOTE>

<P>That <HI>Gildas</HI> should make no mention of this <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Tradition, is no great wonder, and as little to the purpose, to invallidate the Antiquity of it; for we must not regard the Intent and Purport of <HI>Gil∣das</HI>'s Writing, which was not to give an account of the History and Antiquity of the <HI>Britains,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much as to inveigh against the Prophaneness and licentiousness of the Age; wherein his Zeal and Passion carried him so far, that he did not spare ei∣ther Princes or the greatest Persons; and therefore he might well omit to give an account of the Ori∣gine of the <HI>Britains,</HI> seeing it was remote from, and exclusive of his purpose. <HI>Cesar</HI> indeed seems to have been somewhat more inquisitive about the antient State and Descent of those People he invaded; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his stay in <HI>Britain</HI> was so short, and his knowledg of the Country so defective, being he had no Com∣munication with the Ireland <HI>Britains,</HI> whom he own himself to be the antient Inhabitants, that it can b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no great wonder he should be ignorant of this Tra∣dition: for if this curious Person had had the oppor∣tunity of a free Conversation with the <HI>Britains,</HI> he would in all likelyhood have left a large Discovery of their Manners and Customs, and given a more perfect Description of <HI>Britain;</HI> which at that time would have been a very acceptable Performance, to all the Persons of Learning and Curiosity in <HI>Rome,</HI> who as yet had but very shallow knowledg of the Island. Or if we suppose that he made the strictest enquiry about the state of the <HI>Britains,</HI> which he might probably have learnt from <HI>Mandubratius</HI> the Son of <HI>Imanuentius,</HI> King of the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> who for fear of <HI>Cassibelan,</HI> had come over to him to <HI>Gaul,</HI> and sided with him during the <HI>British</HI> Wars 'tis very possible he might be ignorant that the <HI>Bri∣tains</HI> were descended from the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and that to
<PB REF="17"/> be an antient and a current Tradition among them.</P>
<P><HI>Tacitus</HI> was never in <HI>Britain,</HI> but from the rela∣tion of his Father in Law, <HI>Julius Agricola,</HI> and others, he made a Guest, that from the different Shapes and Colour, they were descended from different Nations; some from <HI>Germany,</HI> some from <HI>Gaul,</HI> and others from <HI>Spain;</HI> but yet, as to the Primitive <HI>Britains,</HI> those who seemed to be the antient Inhabitants of the <HI>Island,</HI> he concludes after the usual Pagan manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In vita Agric.</NOTE> <HI>Britanniam qui mortales initio coluerint, Indigenae an Adve∣cti, ut inter Barbaros parum compertum.</HI> The <HI>Bri∣tains,</HI> indeed, in <HI>Tacitus</HI> his time, were well known to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and consequently these latter might have been easily instructed, as to what knowledg the <HI>Britains</HI> had of their Antiquity; but it does not there∣fore necessarily follow, that because this Historian does not mention any such Tradition, there was none really among them; because possibly he might never have heard of it; or if he did, he might have omitted insert∣ing of it in his History: For what he has delivered re∣lating to the Antiquity of the <HI>Britains,</HI> was but contin∣gent to his purpose, the whole scope of his design being to describe the Actions of his Father in Law, during his Lieutenancy in this Island; and therefore was not at all wonderful, that he has given but a slight and an imperfect account of what he never design'd to make a narrow inspection into. Besides, if we suppose him to have made a diligent enquiry into the matter, and to have mind to know the antient State and Origine of the <HI>Britains;</HI> yet since he wanted the opportunity of con∣versing with them, having been never in <HI>Britain;</HI> and none of the <HI>Britains</HI> that we know of, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing at <HI>Rome,</HI> o <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept those who from their youth were educated there, and cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quently were in all probability ignorant of the Traditions of their own Country; he might very well at such a distinct have been never made acquainted with such a National Tradition, which for all that might have been current and prevailing among the <HI>Britain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB REF="18"/> themselves. As to other Roman Historians, who have writ of the Antiquity and Primitive State of <HI>Rome,</HI> that they have made no mention of any such Person as <HI>Brutus</HI> the Son of <HI>Sylvius;</HI> I have already observed, is not of that force as to overthrow this Tra∣dition, by reason that, from <HI>Aeneas</HI> down to <HI>Romu∣lus,</HI> there is regard only had to the Line of Succession, and those only recorded who succeeded in the Throne.</P>
<P>Let us consider now, in the next place, what proba∣ble Reasons may be assigned to vindicate this supposed <HI>Trojan</HI> Origin from an utter Fiction; and whether the History of <HI>Brutus</HI> have any probable dependance up∣on some real Foundation. And not to insist on the An∣tiquity of this Tradition, nor the Authority of the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> History published by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> nothing gives grea∣ter Confirmation to assert some real Foundation for this supposed Fable, than the near Alliance and Affinity betwixt the <HI>Britains</HI> and the <HI>Grecians.</HI> All Learned Men allow that the <HI>Greek</HI> was the antient Language of the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and that their Customs were not much different; and whoever will compare the Manners, Religion and Customs of the <HI>Britiains</HI> with those of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> will easily discover a palpable Conformity betwixt both Nations, but more especially in the Lan∣guage; in which, as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> says, <HI>Maximum est disputationis firmamentum &amp; certissimum ori∣ginis gentium argumentum. Qui enim</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he goes on) <HI>linguae societate conjuncti sunt, originis etiam Communione fuisse conjunctos, homo opinor ne∣mo inficiabitur.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not, at present, trouble the Reader with a par∣ticular annumeration of that Affinity; but will refer him to Sir <HI>John Price</HI>'s <HI>Defen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io Historiae Britanni∣cae,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sheringham</HI>'s Treatise <HI>De G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntis An∣glorum Origine.</HI> Now, since there is such demonstra∣ble Affinity betwixt the <HI>Britains</HI> and the <HI>Grecians</HI> in all these respects; we must either suppose, with Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> that they are of the same Origin, at least
<PB REF="18"/> that a Colony of either <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Trojans</HI> came over to this Island; or else, that the <HI>Britains</HI> had Corre∣spondence, Traffick and Communication with the <HI>Gre∣cians.</HI> Now, that the <HI>Grecians</HI> had no knowledge of the <HI>Britains</HI> till very late, may be gather'd from hence, that even the Name of <HI>Britain</HI> is not so much as men∣tioned by any <HI>Greek</HI> Author before <HI>Polybius,</HI> who liv'd less than two hundred years before the <HI>Roman</HI> Invasion, and by him but just named, as betokening a very remote and distant Country, wherein indeed it was reported that there was plenty of Tin. Nay, <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> was so far unknown to the Eastern parts of the World, long after this, that even <HI>Cæsar</HI> himself, when he intended an Invasion, was perfectly ignorant of the State of the Island; and tho he made what Enquiry he could of the <HI>British</HI> Merchants in <HI>Gaul,</HI> yet for all that, as he says himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bell. Gall. Lib. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Ne{que} quanta esset Infulæ magni∣tudo, ne{que} quæ aut quantæ Nationes incolerent, ne{que} quem usum belli haberent, aut quibus institu∣tis uterentur, ne{que} qui essent ad majorum navium idonei portus, reperire poterat:</HI> and therefore he was forced to send <HI>Cajus Volusenus</HI> before him, to search into the State and Condition of the Island. Such Stran∣gers were the <HI>Romans</HI> at this time to the Isle of <HI>Bri∣tain.</HI> And can it be supposed, that the <HI>Grecians</HI> had a better knowledg of it, since, in all probability, if they had had a Commerce with the <HI>Britains,</HI> the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were Masters of the Sea long before this, would have quickly discovered their Merchandizing; which if as profitable as is imagined, they were no such Enemies to Gain but they would share in the Booty. At least, had the <HI>Grecians</HI> had any Correspondence with the <HI>Britains,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> would in all probability have known it, and consequently they must needs have received better Intelligence of the Island than what they seem to have had at <HI>Cæsar</HI>'s Landing. But <HI>Dion Cassius</HI> seems to put this matter out of dispute, and gives as a very plain account of what knowledge the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>
<PB REF="19" MS="y"/> had of this Island, which I will set down in the Latin Translation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 39.</NOTE> <HI>Primis Græcorum Romanorúm{que} ne esse quidem Britanniam compertum fuit, posterio∣res in controversiam adduxerunt, continens ea ter∣ra, an verò insula esset; multá{que} de utra{que} opinio∣ne conscripta sunt ab iis, qui certi quidem nil no∣verant (quippe qui nec vidissent, nec ab <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndigenis qualis esset accepissent) sed conjecturis tantum, quantum vel otii vel studii singulis aderat uteren∣tur.</HI> And the antient Poet, in <HI>Eustathius</HI> upon <HI>Diony∣sius,</HI> reckoning up the greatest Islands of the World in his time, makes no mention of <HI>Britain,</HI> which shews it was not then known. And that <HI>Britain</HI> was the antient <HI>Cassiterides</HI> of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> from whence they re∣ceived their Tin, is altogether uncertain; for <HI>Herodo∣tus,</HI> making mention of those Islands of <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> fairly declares he knew not where they were; which cannot well be supposed, if the <HI>Grecian</HI> Merchants traded thither in his time; it being rational to imagin that, in treating of any Country, such a Learned Hi∣storian would endeavour to get the best intelligence he possibly could; and Learning being at the highest pitch in <HI>Greece</HI> at this time, 'tis very strange we had not a better account of this Island, which is supposed to be so well known to those who had a constant Trafick here. But indeed, all Authors who have mentioned these <HI>Cas∣siterides</HI> do not seem to have known where they were si∣tuated, only <HI>Dionysius,</HI> in his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, makes them plainly to be the same with the <HI>Hesperides,</HI> those Islands lying in the <HI>Atlantick Ocean,</HI> far enough from <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> concerning which the Poets have invented so many Fables.</P>

<P>But admitting the <HI>Grecians</HI> to have been ignorant of any such Place as <HI>Britain,</HI> and that there never
<PB REF="19"/> was, any Traffic or Communication betwixt these two Nations; yet since the <HI>Gauls</HI> spoke <HI>Greek,</HI> it is not very improbable but that the <HI>Britains</HI> might borrow from them. That the <HI>Gauls</HI> used the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, we have the Testimony of <HI>Cæsar;</HI> and it is very certain, that all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Learning flourished at <HI>Marseils,</HI> which was an antient and famous Ʋniversity, and is very much celebrated by all almost, both <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Writers. And by this means, it may be reason∣ably concluded, how the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Gaulish Druids</HI> became acquainted with the <HI>Grecian</HI> Philosophy, which being as to all the different Sects and Opinions of it, taught at <HI>Marseils,</HI> the <HI>Druids</HI> more particularly ad∣hered to the <HI>Pythagorean,</HI> to which the <HI>Druid</HI> Philo∣sophy hears a very near resemblance, both as to the Do∣ctrine of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the Transmigration of the Soul, and the rest of their Mystical <HI>Cabala,</HI> which they so superstitiously kept secret and close from the People.</P>
<P>But in opposition to this, it may be with greater cer∣tainty urged, that neither the <HI>Gaulish</HI> nor <HI>British Druids</HI> had any Correspondence with the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and consequently could not borrow their Philosophical Mysteries from them. For if <HI>Cæsar</HI> may be believed, <HI>The Art and Learning of the</HI> Druids <HI>was first found out in</HI> Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. VI.</NOTE> <HI>and from thence is thought to be brought into</HI> Gaul; <HI>and at this time,</HI> as he goes on, <HI>such as will attain to the perfect knowledge of that Discipline, do for the most part tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el thi∣ther to learn it.</HI> Now if this be true, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Druids</HI> were the Inventors of this kind of Learn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g, and that the <HI>Gauls</HI> came over hither to be instructed in the Way and Method of it; I can see no reason, why they should have any communication with the <HI>Grecian</HI> Academy at <HI>Marseils,</HI> much less that they borrowed it from the Disciples of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> especially since they accounted their Mysteries so Sacred, that they would communicate them to none, besides those of their own Order. Nay, it may be better questioned, whe∣ther
<PB REF="20"/> <HI>Diuidism</HI> be not much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntienter than <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and antecedent to that <HI>Aera,</HI> when the <HI>Grecians</HI> began to Philosophize. And for the same reason, that the <HI>Druids</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> did not derive their Philosophy from <HI>Marseils,</HI> it will follow, that they could not borrow their Language; for if we suppose, which is the most we can, that the <HI>Gauls</HI> had some communication with those <HI>Grecians,</HI> and upon that account that their Lan∣guage was in some measure mingled with the <HI>Greek;</HI> yet in their travel to <HI>Britain,</HI> they came not to commu∣nicate, but to borrow; and 'tis not likely that the <HI>Bri∣tains</HI> should be affected with the Language of those who came to learn of them. Besides, of all the number of <HI>Gaulish</HI> Words collected by <HI>Cambden,</HI> which agree with the <HI>British,</HI> few or none seem to be of <HI>Greek</HI> De∣rivation; so it is highly improbable, as for as we can see into this Matter, that the <HI>Gauls</HI> should ever com∣municate the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue to the <HI>Britains.</HI> And therefore, since this difficulty cannot be removed by any other way, it is not unreasonable to suspect, that there is some real Foundation lodged in the Ruins of the Story of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and that the Truth is disfigured by the boundless accession of Poetical Invention.</P>
<P>I should tire the Reader, and exceed the just bounds of what I at first proposed, if I should take a particular view of the <HI>British</HI> History published by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> and therefore I shall now only take notice of the Life of King <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> where the History of <HI>Wales</HI> begins, and where a palpable Mistake, I may call it Forgery, has been committed by one side or another. For the very same things, which the <HI>British</HI> History relate of <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> Writers attribute to <HI>Ceadwalla</HI> King of the West <HI>Saxons,</HI> how he was driven by a Famine out of his Do∣minions, came afterwards to <HI>Rome,</HI> and was received by Pope <HI>Sergius,</HI> with other particulars too tedious here to relate. But that which seems to charge the Fault upon <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> or whoever else was the Author of the <HI>British</HI> History, is, that <HI>Bede</HI> an Author of established Credit,
<PB REF="20"/> and one who lived near those times, says that it was the West <HI>Saxon</HI> King <HI>Ceadwalla</HI> that went to <HI>Rome</HI> in Pope <HI>Sergius</HI>'s time. But then on the other side, it is hardly conceivable, supposing the <HI>British</HI> History a perfect Contrivance, that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> or any other should be so grosly over seen, as to borrow the Transaction of a real King, and one so well known, to make up the Life of a fictitious one cotemporary with him. <HI>Bede</HI>'s Reputation was too firm, to be shaken by an upstart History, and there∣fore it cannot well be supposed that the Author of the <HI>British</HI> History was so unwary, in case he designed a Cheat, as to let himself open to so easy a detection of Forgery. All then that can be said, is, that the agree∣ableness of the Names and time that these two Princes lived in, and possibly their both going to <HI>Rome,</HI> which was not unusual in those days, might without any design of putting upon the World, make a confusion in their Histo∣ries. But whether the Life of <HI>Cadwalader</HI> be a Fable, the Reader is at his own liberty to judge; it being pre∣fixed to the History of <HI>Wales,</HI> not as it is more Authen∣tick, or any way of greater certainty than the rest of <HI>Geof∣frey</HI>'s History, but only because the Author <HI>Caradoc</HI> of <HI>Lhangarfan,</HI> began his continuace of the <HI>British</HI> Hi¦story with it.</P>
<P>This <HI>Caradoo</HI> of <HI>Lhangaifan,</HI> an Author of un∣doubted Integrity, was cotemporary with <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> who taking his rise from the place where the <HI>British</HI> History concluded, made a continuation of it thro' the Reigns of several of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> till the Year <HI>1157.</HI> a∣bout which time he flourished. After him, all things of moment that happened in <HI>Wales,</HI> were kept and recorded in the Abbies of <HI>Conwey</HI> in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Ystrat∣flur</HI> in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> where the Princes and Noblemen of <HI>Wales</HI> were buried, as appears by the Testimony of <HI>Gutryn Owen,</HI> who lived in the time of <HI>Edward IV.</HI> and writ the most exact and perfect Copy of the same. All the most notable Occurrences being thus Registred in these Abbies, were most generally compared together every third
<PB REF="21"/> Year, when the <HI>Beirdh</HI> or <HI>Bards</HI> belonging to these two Houses went their ordinary Visitations, which was called <HI>Clera.</HI> And this continued until the Year <HI>1270.</HI> a little before the Death of the last Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> who was slain at <HI>Buelht. Humphrey Lloyd</HI> Gent. who flourished in the Reign of <HI>Henry VIII.</HI> and one greatly skill'd in the <HI>British</HI> Antiqui∣ties, continued this History to the Death of Prince <HI>Lhewelyn;</HI> and afterwards having translated the whole into <HI>English</HI> Lan∣guage, had designed to commit it to the Press. But his Death prevented what he purposed, and stopped the publica∣tion of this History for a long time after, until <HI>David Powel</HI> D. D. in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> having met with <HI>Humphrey Lloyd</HI>'s Transtation, collected what he could out of <HI>English</HI> Historians, which he added by way of Annotati∣ons, and so published it in the Year <HI>1584.</HI> This being the sole History of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the only Edition of this History, I was moved to prepare it for another Im∣pression by a new modelling the Language, making the Body of the History intire, without troubling the Reader to see the same thing by way of Annotation, Dr. <HI>Powel</HI>'s Notes being for the greatest part but a repetition of the same matter of Fact out of the <HI>English</HI> Historians, with what other Improve∣ments could be made. The Additions which I made to the former History, I chiefly, took out of the Notes of that late great Antiquarian Mr. <HI>Robert Vaughan</HI> of <HI>Hengwrt;</HI> by whose help also I have corrected, supplyed and continued the Chronology. Sir <HI>John Price</HI>'s Description of <HI>Wales</HI> will pretty well answer the Geographical part of this History, til we shall be able to recover and fix several of those places whose <HI>Names</HI> are only left to us at present, which we have great hopes, will be successfully perfected, by the unwearied Labours of my ingenious Friend Mr. <HI>Edward Lhwyd,</HI> in his intended Etymological Dictionary. I have added by way of Appendix, the several Records belonging to this History, and chose rather to insert the Articles of Peace betwixt Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> and <HI>John Peckam</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> in the Original, with reference thereunto, than to insert all the Grievances which the <HI>Welch</HI> then made in the <HI>English</HI> Languge, which do not so bandsomly bear a Translation.</P>

Likewise the dwellers of <HI>Tyroll</HI> and other the higher Countries of <HI>Germany</HI> do Name the <HI>Italian</HI> their next Neighbour a <HI>Welch-man,</HI> and his Language <HI>Walsh.</HI> And this is an evident Proof, that they which harped upon a Queen <HI>Gwalaes,</HI> and of a Prince <HI>Wala</HI> (of whom nei∣ther <HI>British, Latin,</HI> nor <HI>English</HI> History maketh men∣tion) were foully deceived; and so likewise was a great Historiographer of late Days, which saith, that it was called <HI>Wallia, quasi Italia,</HI> because the rest of the <HI>Romans</HI> which remained in the Isle were driven thither. Neither is this any new invention, although <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> with an <HI>Italian</HI> brag doth glorify him∣self to be the first that espied it out, for divers an∣tient Writers do alledge the same cause of the Name of <HI>Wales,</HI> of whom <HI>Sylvester Gyraldus</HI> is one, who
<PB N="iii" REF="22"/> wrote in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, after the Conquest, before 380 years passed; which is an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vident Token, that the said <HI>Polydore</HI> did either ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er see nor read the antient Histories of this Realm, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r dissembleth the same to the Advancement and Praise of himself and his Country; which to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earned and indifferent Reader shall appear to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly occasion he took that work in hand, for all his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook redoundeth only to the Praise and Honour of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Romans</HI> as well Spiritual as Temporal, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lase forth their Acts and Deeds within this Realm: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd upon the other part doth either openly slander, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r else privily extenuate, or shamefully deny the mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial prowess and noble Acts, as well of <HI>Saxons, Danes,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>Normans,</HI> as of the <HI>Britains,</HI> all Inhabiters of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sle. Which thing he that lift to prove, let him read <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd confer <HI>Cæsar</HI>'s Commentaries, <HI>Cornelius Tacitus, Herodianus,</HI> and other antient Writers, as well in <HI>Latin</HI> as in <HI>Greek,</HI> with his Work. As for the anti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent Writers of the <HI>British</HI> History, as the <HI>British</HI> Chronicle, the History of <HI>Gildas, Ponticus Vorunnius,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea the Golden Work of <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> Monk of St. <HI>Alban,</HI> which wrote from <HI>William Bastard,</HI> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast years of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; I dare well say he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever saw them, they be in divers places to be had, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that the truth may be easily proved. To make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n end I say, that he being first a Stranger born, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso ignorant as well in the Histories of this Realm, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f those Tongues and Languages wherein the same were written, could never set forth the true and per∣fect Chronicle of the same. But he having a good Grace, and a pleasant Stile in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, and finding himself in a Country where every Man either <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acked Knowledge or Spirit to set forth the History of their own Country, took this Enterprise in hand, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir great shame, and no less dispraise, because he a blind Leader shall draw a great Number of undiscreet and rash Followers, as well Geographers and Cosmo∣graphers, as Chroniclers and Historiographers, to the Hark Pit of Ignorance, where I leave them at this time, remitting the Reader to the Apology of Sir <HI>John
<PB N="iv" REF="23"/> Price</HI> Knight and his <HI>British</HI> History, written by him of purpose, against the envious Reports, and slande∣rous Taints of the said <HI>Polydore,</HI> where he shall see a great number of his Errors confuted at large. And to return to my former matter of the Name of <HI>Wales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wales.</NOTE> which Name to be given of late by a strange Nation may be otherwise proved: for the <HI>Welch-men</HI> them∣selves do not understand what these words <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Welch</HI> do signify, nor know any other Name of thee Country or themselves but <HI>Cambry,</HI> nor of their Lan∣guage but <HI>Cambraec,</HI> which is as much to say as <HI>Camber</HI>'s Language or Speech, So likewise they know not what <HI>England</HI> or <HI>English</HI> meaneth, but common¦ly they, call the Country <HI>Lhoyger,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Men <HI>Saison,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rino. A Saxon.</NOTE> and the <HI>English</HI> Tongue <HI>Saisonace.</HI> Which is an evident token that this is the same Language which the <HI>Britains</HI> spake at the beginning; for the Works of <HI>Merdhyn</HI> and of <HI>Taliessin,</HI> who wrote above 1000 years past, are almost the same words which they use at this day, or at the least easy to be understood o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every one which knoweth perfectly the <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue especially in <HI>North Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Beside this, where at this day, there do remain three remnants of the <HI>Britains,</HI> divided every one from other with the Seas, which are in <HI>Wales, Corn∣wall</HI> (called in <HI>British Cerniw</HI>) and little <HI>Britain</HI> yet almost all the particular words of these three People are all one, although in pronunciation and Writing of the Sentences they differ somewhat, which is no marvel, seeing that the pronunciation in one Realm is often so diverse, that the one can scarce understand the other. But it is rather a wonder, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Welch-men</HI> being separated from the <HI>Cornish,</HI> wel nigh these 900 years, and the <HI>Britains</HI> from either of them 290 years before that, and having smal Traffick or Concourse together since that time, have still kept their own <HI>British</HI> Tongue. They are not therefore to be credited, which deny the <HI>Welch</HI> to be the old <HI>British</HI> Tongue. And here I cannot pass over what one of these fine Chroniclers wrote of late, of the Name of <HI>Britain,</HI> affirming that it should be so
<PB N="v" REF="23"/> called of <HI>Britanie</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> as the Elder of that Name. But surely he had either never seen <HI>Ptolomy</HI> nor <HI>Cæsar,</HI> nor any other antient Writer, or read them with small Judgment and Memory. For there he might have learned, that when this Land was called <HI>Britain,</HI> the other was called <HI>Armorica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rob. Cae∣nal. lib. <HI>2.</HI> Per. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> and how in <HI>Maximus</HI>'s time, <HI>Conan Meriadoc</HI> was the first that gave it that Name, and inhabited it with <HI>Britains</HI> out of this Isle. Other derivations of these words <HI>Britannia</HI> and <HI>Albion,</HI> out of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> I am ashamed to rehearse; for unto such Errors do they commonly fall, that either puffed up with vain-glory of their own Wits, or pinched with despite and envy at other Men's Works, or blinded with Igorance, do go about to write and set forth any History or Chro∣nicle. But passing over this matter until another time, I will return to the Description of <HI>Wales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mears &amp; bounds of <HI>Wales.</HI></NOTE> which (as I said) was of old time compassed almost about with the <HI>Irish</HI> Seas, and the Rivers <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Severn,</HI> although afterwards the <HI>Saxons</HI> wan by force from the <HI>Britains</HI> all the plain and champion Country o∣ver the Rivers, and specially <HI>Offa</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> who made a Ditch of great breadth and depth, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mear betwixt his Kingdom and <HI>Wales,</HI> which Ditch began at the River <HI>Dee,</HI> by <HI>Bassingwerk,</HI> be∣tween <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> and ran along the Hills sides to the <HI>South</HI> Sea, a little below <HI>Bristol,</HI> reaching above a hundred Miles in length, and is in many places to be seen at this day, bearing the Name of <HI>Clawdh Offa,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Offa</HI>'s Ditch, and the Country between it and <HI>England</HI> is commonly called in <HI>Welch, Y Mars,</HI> although the great part of it be now inhabited by <HI>Welch</HI>-men, namely in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> which yet keepeth the antient limits to the River <HI>Dee,</HI> and in some places over it. Other (as <HI>Sylvester Giraldus</HI>) make the River <HI>Wy,</HI> called in <HI>Welch Gwy,</HI> to be the Mear between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> part, called <HI>South-Wales,</HI> who measureth the breadth of <HI>Wales,</HI> from <HI>Salow</HI> or <HI>Willoweford,</HI> called <HI>Rhyd yr helig</HI> upon <HI>Wy,</HI> to St. <HI>Davids</HI> in <HI>Menevia</HI> 100 Miles, and the length from <HI>Caerlheon</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="24"/> upon <HI>Ysc</HI> in <HI>Gwentland,</HI> to <HI>Holybead,</HI> called <HI>Caergybi</HI> in <HI>Anglesey,</HI> in <HI>Welch,</HI> called <HI>Môn,</HI> above 100. Miles and these be the common Mears at this day, altho' the <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue is commonly used and spoken in <HI>England,</HI> beyond these old Mears a great way, as in <HI>Hereford-shire, Glocester-shire,</HI> and a part of <HI>Shrop∣shire.</HI> And thus for the general Description of <HI>Wales,</HI> which afterward about the Year of Christ 870. <HI>Ro∣dericus Magnus,</HI> King of <HI>Wales,</HI> divided into three Territories which they called Kingdoms, which re∣mained until of late days.</P>
<P>These three were <HI>Gwynedh,</HI> in English <HI>North-Wales, Deheubarth,</HI> in English <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Powys</HI>-Land; in every of the which he ordained a Princely Seat or Court for the Prince to remain at, most commonly, as in <HI>Gwynedh</HI> (which some old Writers call <HI>Venedo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> for <HI>Gwynethia) Aberffraw</HI> in the Islle of <HI>Môn</HI> or <HI>An∣glesey.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aberf∣fraw.</NOTE> In <HI>Deheubarth,</HI> called in <HI>Latin</HI> Demetia, <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦mardyn,</HI> from whence it was afterward removed to <HI>Dynefowr,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dyne∣fowr.

And first of <HI>North-Wales</HI> as the chiefest part, which he gave his Eldest Son, ordaining that either of the other two should pay him yearly 200 <HI>l.</HI> of Tribute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">North-Wales.</NOTE> as it appeareth in the Laws of <HI>Howel Dha,</HI> which are to be had in <HI>Welch,</HI> and also in <HI>Latin.</HI> Therefore <HI>Gwynedh</HI> (called <HI>North-Wales</HI>) had upon the <HI>North</HI>-side the Sea, from the River <HI>Dee</HI> at <HI>Basing-werke</HI> to <HI>Aberdyfi,</HI> and upon the <HI>West</HI> and <HI>South-West</HI> the River <HI>Dyfi,</HI> which divideth it from <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and in some places from <HI>Powys</HI>-Land. And on the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>East,</HI> it is divided from <HI>Powys,</HI> sometimes with Mountains, and sometimes with Rivers, till is come to the River <HI>Dee,</HI> again. This Land was of old time divided to four parts, of which the chiefest was <HI>Môn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Môn.</NOTE> in <HI>English</HI> called <HI>Anglesey,</HI> where the Prince's
<PB N="vii" REF="24"/> chief House was at <HI>Aberffraw,</HI> which is an Island se∣parated from the main Land, with an Arm of the Sea called <HI>Maenai,</HI> and had in it self three Cantreds or Hundreds, which were subdivided to six Comots, as Cantref <HI>Aberffraw</HI> to Comot <HI>Lhion,</HI> and Comot <HI>Malhera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th,</HI> Cantref <HI>Cemais,</HI> to the Comots <HI>Talibo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI> and <HI>Twr Celyn;</HI> Cantref <HI>Rossyr</HI> to the Comots <HI>Tyndaethwy</HI> and <HI>Maenai.</HI> And at this day there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Town in that Isle called <HI>Bewmoris,</HI> and a com∣mon Passage to <HI>Ireland</HI> at <HI>Caergybi,</HI> called in <HI>English, Holyhead.</HI> But here I cannot wink at that notable Error of <HI>Polydor,</HI> which (after his accustomed fa∣shion) denieth this Isle to be called <HI>Môna,</HI> but <HI>An∣glesia,</HI> or <HI>Anglorum Insula,</HI> because it is called in English <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and giveth this Name <HI>Môna</HI> to <HI>Man,</HI> and so hath lost the Names of both Isles: which igno∣rance and forgetfulness might be forgiven him, if he had not drawn a great number to this Error with him, which in their Charters do daily wrong Name these Isles, which may be easily proved. First, be∣cause the Inhabitants of the Isle do know none other Name but <HI>Môn;</HI> and it is called through all <HI>Wales, Tir Môn,</HI> that is to say, the Land of <HI>Môn,</HI> unto this day. So that neither by memory of Man, neither by any Monument in Writing in the <HI>British</HI> Tongue can it appear, that ever it had any other Name but <HI>Môn,</HI> yet there be manifest Monuments for these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>000 years. It is also grown to a Proverb through <HI>Wales,</HI> for the fertility of the ground, <HI>Môn mam Gymry,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is to say, <HI>Môn</HI> Mother of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>The antient History of <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> (which be like Age had beaten out of <HI>Polydor</HI>'s Head) saith, that the Souldiers of <HI>Paulinus Suetonius,</HI> and afterward of <HI>Julius Agricola,</HI> after they had passed thro' <HI>North-Wales,</HI> then came over against <HI>Môna,</HI> where they did swim over an Arm of the Sea of 200 paces, and so by force won the Isle. Now whether it is more reasonable thus to swim over 200 paces, or 20 miles? I know there is no Man that believeth <HI>Polydor</HI> in this point; I see all Men therefore judge the rest. As for that which he saith of the great Woods, it is nothing;
<PB N="viii" REF="25"/> for both the <HI>Romans,</HI> and after when the Christian Faith took place in this Realm, the Christians did fall and root them out, for the Idolatry and absur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Religion which was used there; that the King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Man</HI> sent for Timber to <HI>Môn;</HI> read the Life of <HI>Hug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> which also is evident by the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Beeches and other Trees found in the Earth at these days. His other reason is, because it is called <HI>Angle∣sey</HI> in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue: so is <HI>Lhoyger</HI> England and <HI>Cambry</HI> Wales; Are those therefore the old Names? No surely. And what if the Inhabitan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> called it so? (as they did not) had it not a Nam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before the <HI>Angles</HI> won it? Yes, I warrant you, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had forgotten that. Now to the Name of <HI>Man,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was ever, or at the least these 1000 years named i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> British <HI>Manaw,</HI> of which cometh the <HI>English</HI> Name <HI>Man.</HI> The Inhabitants thereof call it so, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nation about it did ever call it <HI>Môn,</HI> no nor any Writer but <HI>Polydor,</HI> which was too young a God father to name so old a Child. For <HI>Gildas</HI> who wrote above 900 years passed, whose Writings <HI>Polydor</HI> ne¦ver saw, but untruly Fathers upon him his own de∣vise; <HI>Giraldus</HI> in his Description of <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Henr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the Second, and <HI>Henry Huntington,</HI> do plainly ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Man</HI> in Latin <HI>Eub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia,</HI> adding thereto either <HI>Man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> or <HI>Man,</HI> for the better understanding of the Name.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF WALES.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, under <HI>Valen∣tinian the Younger,</HI> began to decline, and became sensibly unable to repress the perpetual Incursions of the <HI>Goths, Huns, Vandals,</HI> and other barbarous Invaders; it was found necessary to abandon the remotest Parts of that unwieldy Body, and to recal the <HI>Roman</HI> Forces that defended them, the better to secure the Inward, and the Provinces most exposed to the Depredations of the <HI>Barbarians.</HI> And in this Exigency of the <HI>Roman</HI> Af∣fairs, <HI>Britain,</HI> as lying far remote from the Heart of the Empire, was deprived of the <HI>Roman</HI> Garrisons; which, being transported into <HI>Gaul</HI> upon more urgent Occasions, left it naked and exposed to the inveterate Cruelty of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts:</HI> for no sooner had they understood of the <HI>Romans</HI> Departure out of <HI>Britain,</HI> and that the <HI>Britains</HI> were to expect no further Help from the Empire; but they descend in greater Num∣ber than formerly, and with greater Courage and Ex∣pectation, being how rid of the Fear they entertained of the <HI>Roman</HI> Legions, who always used to hinder their
<PB N="2" REF="34"/> Progress, and to prevent their Incursions into the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Province. The <HI>Britains</HI> perceiving their antient and implacable Enemies to fall upon them, and finding themselves far too weak to repel their Endless Deva∣stations; with a lamentable Narrative of their own Miseries, and the cruel Oppressions of their Enemies, they sent over to <HI>Gaul,</HI> imploring Aid of <HI>Aetius</HI> Praefect of that Province; who, being moved with the de∣plorable Condition of the <HI>Britains,</HI> dispatch'd over a Legion under the Command of <HI>Gallio,</HI> which unexpe∣ctedly surprising the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> forced them, with great Loss and Destruction, to retire over the Seas or Friths to their own Habitations. Then helping then to build a Wall of Stone cross the Land, for a Bul∣wark against any future Irruptions; the <HI>Romans,</HI> at their Departure, told them, they could not any more undertake such dangerous Expeditions for their De∣fence, and therefore admonished them to take Arms and like Men vindicate their Country, their Wives Children and Liberties from the Injuries of their bar∣barous Enemies.</P>
<P>But as soon as the <HI>Roman</HI> Legion was transporte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into <HI>Gaul,</HI> back return the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots;</HI> and, ha∣ving by a desperate Assault passed the Wall, pursue the <HI>Britains</HI> with a more dreadful and bloody Slaugh∣ter than formerly.

<PB N="3" REF="34"/> their Enemies should be gratefully and satisfactorily Rewarded.</P>
<P>The Reason that the <HI>British</HI> Nation was at this time so weak and impotent, and so manifestly unable to withstand these barbarous Enemies, who were far inferiour as to extent of Countrey, and probably in number of People, may in great measure be attri∣buted to the Ease and Quietness the <HI>Britains</HI> enjoy'd under the <HI>Roman</HI> Government. For whilst the <HI>Roman</HI> Legions continued in <HI>Britain,</HI> they ever undertook the Security and Preservation of it; so that the <HI>Britains</HI> heretofore were little concerned at the Incursions of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> depending wholly upon the Strength and Valour of the <HI>Romans,</HI> insomuch, that within a while, they fell into a fit of Luxury and Ef∣feminacy, and quickly forgot that Martial Prowness, and Military Conduct which their Ancestors so Fa∣mously excelled in. For after their intire Subjection to the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, they had little or no Opportu∣nity to Experience their Valour, excepting in some home-bred Commotions, excited by the aspiring Am∣bition of some <HI>male</HI>-contented General, which were quickly compos'd and reduced to nothing. And after the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> grew Formidable, and durst ven∣ture to make Incursions into the <HI>Roman</HI> Province, the <HI>Britains</HI> were the least concerned in Opposing them, leaving that to the Care and Vigilancy of the <HI>Roman</HI> Garrisons. And this Easiness and Supinity of the <HI>Bri∣tains,</HI> may not be untruly attributed to the Policy of the <HI>Roman</HI> Constitution: For when the <HI>Britains</HI> were brought subject to the Empire, the first thing the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> effected towards the Confirmation of their Obe∣dience, was to take the Sword out of their Hands. They were sensible how Bold and Valorous the <HI>Bri∣tains</HI> naturally were, how <HI>unlike</HI> to submit their Necks to a Foreign Yoke, and therefore they found it im∣practicable to obtain a quiet Possession of this Pro∣vince, as long as the <HI>Britains</HI> had Power and Oppor∣tunity to Oppose them. This Course they found very effectual, and when they had once lulled them asleep, they were not over solicitous to rouse and awaken them.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="35"/>
<P>The <HI>Britains</HI> also might possibly be too much taken with this sedentary and unactive Life; and as long as they lived Secure under the Protection of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, they little feared their Countrey would be∣come a Prey to any barbarous Nation. No one would have imagined that that Glorious Empire would be so soon crushed to pieces, which could not otherwise be effected, than by the insupportable pres∣sure of its own Weight. This apprehension of the Greatness and Strength of the <HI>Romans,</HI> made the <HI>Bri∣tains</HI> probably less solicitous of enabling themselves to Defend their Countrey, not thinking they would ever forsake and relinquish the Province of <HI>Britain.</HI> But to their Sorrow they experienc'd the contrary, the Affairs of the Empire elsewhere requiring the Help of the <HI>British</HI> Legions, so that they were left exposed to the Cruelties of the <HI>Northern</HI> Invaders, having not as yet recovered any Power or Conduct to oppose them. For had not the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> come on so forcibly at first, but had given time to the <HI>Britains</HI> to shake off that Lethargy they had for many Years been bu∣ried in, and to renew their Antient Discipline and Vi∣gour, there had been no need of calling in the <HI>Saxons,</HI> seeing they would in all probability been able to Main∣tain their Ground against any Opposition, and likely had been in Possession of their whole Countrey to this time. But next to the Decree of Heaven, the Ruin of the <HI>British</HI> Nation must be attributed to its too much Luxury and Effeminacy, and to the universal Lapse of the Nobility and People into an aversion of an Mili∣tary Action and Martial Discipline. For tho' a con∣tinued Peace be in it self desirable, yet oftentimes no∣thing tends more to the future Ruin and Downfal of a Nation. For Peace begets in Men generally a habit of Looseness and Debauchery, is the occasion of many notorious Extravagancies and vitious Practises, which weakens their Hands, and cools their Courage and Greatness of Mind, so that in case of any open Dan∣ger, they are uncapable to Defend their Countrey, and unfit to Oppose the Common Enemy. Scarce any Kingdom or Nation was subverted, but the Ruin of
<PB N="5" REF="35"/> it was usher'd in by these means; witness the <HI>As∣syrian</HI> under <HI>Sardanapalus,</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> under <HI>Darius,</HI> and the <HI>Egyptian</HI> under <HI>Cleopatra;</HI> so that it was most prudently urged by a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator, that <HI>Carthage</HI> might not be demolished, lest that for want of an Enemy abroad, the Valour of the <HI>Romans</HI> might de∣generate, and their Conduct be forgotten. Had the <HI>Britains</HI> had the Fortune to be continually in action, and not exchanged their Courage and Discipline for Ease and Laziness, they had had no reason to dread the Incursions of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> nor any need of the Aid and Assistance of a foreign Nation; but the condition of their Affairs then required it, and Help must be had, or else their Countrey must una∣voidably become a Prey to those Northern Invaders.</P>
<P>To prevent therefore and repel their Violence, King <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtigern</HI> held a Council of his Great Men and Nobles, where it was concluded to be most advanta∣geous to the <HI>Britains,</HI> to invite the <HI>Saxons</HI> out of <HI>Germany</HI> to their aid, who in all probability would gladly embrace the opportunity, by reason that their own Countrey was grown too scanty for their super∣fluous Numbers. This Message of the <HI>Britains,</HI> how∣ever originally delivered, is by an antient <HI>Saxon</HI> Wri∣ter repeated in this manner; <HI>Most noble</HI> Saxons, <HI>the miserable</HI> Britains, <HI>shatter'd and quite worn out by the frequent Incursions of their Enemies, upon the news of your many signal Victories, have sent us to you, humbly requesting that you would assist them at this juncture. A Land large and spacious, abounding with all manner of Necessaries, they give up entirely to your disposal. Hitherto we have lived happily under the Government and Protection of the</HI> Romans; <HI>next to the</HI> Romans <HI>we know none of greater Valour than your selves, and therefore in your Arms do now seek refuge. Let but that Courage and those Arms make us Conquerors, and we shall refuse no Service you shall please to impose.</HI> To this Message the <HI>Saxons</HI> returned this short An∣swer: <HI>Assure your selves, the</HI> Saxons <HI>will be true Friends to the</HI> Britains, <HI>and as such, shall be always ready both to relieve their Necessities, and to advance their Interest.</HI></P>
<PB N="6" REF="36"/>
<P>The <HI>Saxons</HI> being thus happily courted to what themselves had a thousand times wish'd for, arriv'd soon after in <HI>Britain,</HI> in three Gallies, called in their own Language <HI>Kiules,</HI> under the Conduct of two Brethren <HI>Hengist</HI> and <HI>Horsa.</HI> Being honourably received by the King, and affectionately treated by the People, <HI>their Faith</HI> was given of both sides; the <HI>Saxons</HI> sti∣pulating to defend the <HI>Britains</HI> Countrey, and the <HI>Britains</HI> to give the <HI>Saxons</HI> a satisfactory Reward for all the Pains and Dangers they should undergo upon their account. At first the <HI>Saxons</HI> shewed themselves very diligent in their Employment, and successfully repell'd the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts;</HI> who being probably igno∣rant of the landing of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and fearing no oppo∣sition, boldly advanc'd to the Heart of the Countrey. But when the <HI>Saxons</HI> became better acquainted with the Island, and happily discovered the Weakness and Inability of the <HI>Britains;</HI> under pretence that their Pay was not answerable to their Service and Deserts, they quarrelled with the <HI>Britains,</HI> and instead of sup∣porting them according to Oath, entered into a League with their Enemies the <HI>Scots.</HI> Moreover, <HI>Hengist</HI> per∣ceiving with whom he had to do, sent over to acquaint his Countreymen with the Beauty and Fertility of the Island, the Infirmity and Effeminacy of the Inhabi∣tants; inviting them to be Sharers of his future Suc∣cess and Expectations. To his Invitation they readily comply, and sailing over in great Numbers, they thought to take possession of that Countrey, which Fortune promised should be their own: But they must fight for it first; the <HI>Britains</HI> being resolved to the last to defend themselves and their Country against these treacherous Practices of the <HI>Saxons;</HI> and if possible, to drive them to their primitive Habitations. For when the <HI>Britains</HI> became sensible of the undermining aim of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> how they secretly endeavoured the total extirpation of the <HI>British</HI> Nation, they pre∣sently betook themselves to their Swords, and in a short time became signally famous for their Valour and Conduct. This the <HI>Saxons</HI> afterwards grievously felt, though the total recovery of <HI>Britain</HI> proved im∣practicable
<PB N="7" REF="36"/> for want of Power; the <HI>Saxons</HI> having by Massacres and other treacherous means, most un∣mercifully lessened the Force and Number of the <HI>Bri∣tains.</HI> King <HI>Vortigern</HI> loved his Ease too well to ob∣serve their Practices; and besides, became so <HI>foolishly enamour'd</HI> with the Daughter of <HI>Hengist,</HI> which pur∣posely was laid to intrap him, that the <HI>Saxon</HI> upon the strength of their Marriage began to carve for him∣self, and during <HI>Vortigern</HI>'s Reign, laid so firm a Foun∣dation for the <HI>Saxon</HI> Conquest, that the succeeding <HI>British</HI> Kings; tho' famously valiant, could never un∣dermine it. This Sottishness of his Father, young <HI>Vortimer</HI> could not at length endure; to see himself and his Country so openly and shamefully imposed up∣on by Strangers; and therefore he resolved to take the <HI>British</HI> Government upon himself, and to endeavour the universal Expulsion of the <HI>Saxons.</HI> With him the <HI>British</HI> Nobility willingly joyn, and after several fa∣mous Victories over the <HI>Saxons,</HI> he was unhappily poy∣soned by a <HI>Saxon</HI> Lady. After him the <HI>Britains</HI> brave∣ly defended themselves against the prevailing Greatness of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> under these valiant Princes, <HI>Aurelius Ambrosius, Ʋter Pendragon, Arthur, Constantine</HI> II. <HI>Aurelius Conanus, Vortiper,</HI> and <HI>Maelgon.</HI> To him suc∣ceeded <HI>Careticus;</HI> in whose time the <HI>Saxons</HI> aspiring to a total Conquest of <HI>Britain,</HI> invited over one <HI>Gur∣mundus,</HI> a <HI>Norwegian</HI> Pyrate, who had lately signali∣zed himself in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and obtain'd a Conquest over that Kingdom. Him they employ to march against <HI>Careticus,</HI> who being overcome and vanquished by him, the <HI>Britains</HI> were forced, some to retire beyond the Rivers <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> some to <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and the rest to <HI>Little Britain</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> The <HI>British</HI> Affairs were now brought very low, and their Government reduced within a very narrow compass; so that the Title of the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> can be but superficially attributed to the succeeding Princes, <HI>Cadwan, Cad∣wallan,</HI> and <HI>Cadwalader.</HI></P>

<P>But after that <HI>Cadwalader</HI> had continued some time with <HI>Alan,</HI> the Plague being abated in <HI>Britain</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urposed to return, and if possible, to recover that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art of his Kingdom which the <HI>Saxons</HI> were now in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ossession of. He received frequent Intelligence of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Number and Increase, how they fairly bid for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Conquest of that Country, which had been go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erned by <HI>British</HI> Kings for the space of 1827. Years. This troubled him exceedingly, and tho he had lit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le hopes of prevailing by the Strength and Num∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of his Forces, yet he made the best preparation that the Opportunity would permit, and dispatched his Fleet for the transportation of his Army, which
<PB N="10" REF="38"/> consisted partly of his own Subjects, and partly of such Succours as he received from <HI>Alan.</HI> Whilst he vigorously prosecuted this Design, and was ready to strike sail for Britain; his Voyage was prevented by a Message from Heaven; which counselled him to lay aside the thoughts of recovering his Kingdom, because it was already decreed above, that the <HI>Bri∣tains</HI> should no longer enjoy the Government of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> till the Prophesie of <HI>Merlyn Ambrose</HI> was fulfil∣led. And instead of a Voyage to <HI>Britain,</HI> he is or∣dered to take his Journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he should receive Holy Orders at the hands of Pope <HI>Sergius,</HI> and instead of recovering the <HI>British</HI> Crown, have his own Crown shaved off, and be initiated into the Order of the Monks. Whether this Vision was sig∣nified to him in a Dream, or by the impositious Illu∣sion of some wicked Spirit; or whether it may be a phantastical Conceit of his own, being a Man of a mild and easie temper, wearied with Troubles and Miseries, is very dubious: Only this is certain, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he never returned again to <HI>Britain,</HI> after he had gone over to <HI>Alan.</HI> But <HI>Cadwaladar</HI> had no sooner receiv∣ed this Vision, but immediately he relates the whole to his Friend <HI>Alan,</HI> who presently consults all his pro∣phetical Books, chiefly the famous Works of the two <HI>Merlins, Ambrose</HI> and <HI>Silvester:</HI> The first is said to be begotten on a Spirit, and born in the Town of <HI>Car∣marthen,</HI> whence he received the Name of <HI>Merli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and to flourish in the Reign of King <HI>Vortigern.</HI> The latter called <HI>Caledonius,</HI> from the Forest <HI>Caledon</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Silvester</HI> or <HI>Merlyn Wylbt,</HI> by reason he fell mad, and lived desolately after that he had seen a monstrous shape in the Air, prophesied in the time of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and far more full and intelligible than the former. Both these were in great Reverence and Reputation among the <HI>Britains,</HI> and their Works very religiously preserved, and upon any considerable occasion most venerably consulted. They were of o∣pinion, that nothing could escape their Knowledg; and that no Accident of moment or revolution could happen, which they did not foretel, and was to be

<PB N="20" REF="43"/> vexed the <HI>Saxons,</HI> frequently practised the same; and entering their Countrey by stealth, they killed and destroyed all before them; and driving their Cattel beyond the River, ravaged and laid waste the whole Countrey. <HI>Offa</HI> King of <HI>Mercia</HI> not being able to endure these daily Incursions and Depredations of the <HI>Welch,</HI> entered into a League with the rest of the <HI>Sa∣xon</HI> Kings, to bend their whole Force against the <HI>Welch;</HI> who having raised a very strong and numerous Army, passed the <HI>Severn</HI> into <HI>Wales.</HI> The <HI>Welch</HI> be∣ing far too weak to oppose and encounter so great an Army, quitted the even and plain Countrey, lying upon the Banks of <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Wye,</HI> and retired to the Mountains and Rocks, where they knew they could be most safe from the inveterate and revenge∣ful Arms of the <HI>Saxons.</HI> But as soon as the <HI>Saxons</HI> decamped, being not able to effect any thing against them in these strong and natural Fortifications, the <HI>Welch</HI> still made In-roads into their Territories, and seldom returned without some considerable Booty and Advantage. The <HI>Saxons</HI> were heartily nettled at these bo-peeping Ravagers, and would compliment them still to their Holes, but durst not pursue them further, for fear they should be entrapp'd by such as defended the Streights and Passages into the Rocks. King <HI>Offa</HI> perceiving that he could effect nothing by these Measures, annexed the Country about <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Wye</HI> to his Kingdom of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and planted the same with <HI>Saxons.</HI> And for a farther security against the endless Invasions of the <HI>Welch,</HI> he made a deep Ditch, extending from one Sea to the other, called <HI>Clawd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Offa,</HI> or <HI>Offa</HI>'s Dike; upon which account, the Royal Seat of the Princes of <HI>Powys</HI> was translated from <HI>Pengwern,</HI> now <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> to <HI>Mathraval</HI> in <HI>Montg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣meryshire.</HI></P>

This Custom of <HI>Gavelkind</HI> has been the occasion of the Ruin and Diminution of the Estates of all the antient Nobility in <HI>Wales;</HI> which being endlesly divided between the several Sons of the same Family, were at length reduced to nothing.

<P>THE <HI>Welch</HI> had often sorrowfully felt the unna∣tural Effects of inward Seditions, and of being governed by several Princes, which were now una∣voidably to be renewed by reason of <HI>Roderic</HI>'s impru∣dent Division of his Dominions between his three Sons. For the several Principalities being united in him, it was certainly the most politick means for the preser∣vation of the Countrey from the inveterate Fury of the <HI>English,</HI> to compose the inward Differences which would otherwise happen, by perpetuating the whole Government of <HI>Wales</HI> in one Prince. For it was impossible effectually to oppose the Common Enemy by separate Armies, and where a different Interest interfered, as if the Safety of the same Countrey, and the Honor of the same Prince were unanimously regarded. This was the unhappiness of the antient <HI>Britains</HI> when the <HI>Romans</HI> invaded their Countrey; domestick Broils and inward Dissentions being sown<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> among themselves, they could not agree to unite their Powers, and jointly to oppose the Common E∣nemy; so that <HI>Tacitus</HI> wisely concludes, <HI>dum singu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pugnant universi vincuntur.</HI> There are few Nation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but have experienced the folly of being rent into several Portions, and the downfal of that grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Body the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, may not be absurdly at∣tributed to <HI>Constantine</HI>'s dividing of it between hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sons. But the <HI>Welch</HI> at this time presently felt the unhappiness of it; <HI>Cadelh</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales</HI> be∣ing dissatisfied with his Portion, and desirous to feed his Ambition with larger Territories, could not spare his Brother <HI>Merfyn</HI>'s Countrey, but must needs forci∣bly dispossess him of his lawful Inheritance, and so involve the <HI>Welch</HI> in a Civil War.</P>

<P>But the Succession of the Princes of <HI>Wales</HI> pro∣ceeds in <HI>Anarawd</HI> the eldest Son of <HI>Roderic,</HI> who began his Reign over <HI>North-Wales,</HI> in the Year 877.<MILESTONE N="877" UNIT="A.D."/> At that time <HI>Rollo</HI> with a numerous Army of <HI>Normans</HI> descended into <HI>France,</HI> and possessed themselves of the Countrey of <HI>Neustria,</HI> which from them has since re∣ceived the Name of <HI>Normandy.</HI> But the treache∣rous <HI>Danes</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who had retired to the City of <HI>Exeter,</HI> quickly violated the Capitulation which they had lately sworn to observe, and upon that ac∣count were so warmly pursued by King <HI>Alfred,</HI> that they gladly delivered up Hostages for the perfor∣mance of the Articles formerly agreed upon be∣tween them. But it was not their Intention to keep them long, for the next Year they again broke lose, possessed themselves of all the Countrey upon the North-side of <HI>Thames,</HI> and passing the River, put the <HI>English</HI> to flight, and made themselves Masters of <HI>Chippenham</HI> in <HI>West-Sax.</HI> But their whole Army did not succeed so well, for <HI>Alfred</HI> meeting with a Party of them, slew their Captain and took their Standard, which the <HI>Danes</HI> called <HI>Raven.</HI> After this he vanquished them again at <HI>Edendown,</HI> where after that the <HI>Danes</HI> had given Hostages for their peaceable beha∣viour; <HI>Godrun</HI> their Commander received the Chri∣stian Faith, and so reigned in <HI>East-Angle.</HI> But this opportunity seemed to threaten a great Storm upon <HI>Wales;</HI> for besides the Death of <HI>Aedan</HI> the Son of <MILESTONE N="878" UNIT="A.D."/> <HI>Melht,</HI> a Noble-man of the Countrey, the Articles of Composition between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Danes,</HI> occasioned these last to join their Power with the People of <HI>Mercia</HI> to Fight against the <HI>Welch,</HI> between whom a severe Battel was fought at <HI>Conwey,</HI> where∣in the <HI>Welch</HI> obtained a very signal Victory, which was called <HI>Dial Rodri,</HI> or the Revenge of the Death of Prince <HI>Roderic.</HI> The Reason why the <HI>Mercians</HI> were so irreconcilably enraged against the <HI>Welch</HI> at this time, was this. After the Death of <HI>Roderic the Great,</HI> the Northern <HI>Britains</HI> of <HI>Stratelwyd</HI> and <HI>Cum∣berland</HI> were mightily infested and weakened thro' the daily Incursions of the <HI>Danes, Saxons</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="53"/> insomuch that as many of them as would not submit their Necks to the Yoke were forced to quit their Countrey, and to seek for more quiet Habitations. Therefore towards the beginning of <HI>Anarawd</HI>'s Reign, several of them came to <HI>Gwyneth</HI> under the Conduct of one <HI>Hoberet,</HI> whose distressed Condition the Prince commiserating, granted them all the Countrey be∣twixt <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Conwey</HI> to seat themselves in, in case they could drive out the <HI>Saxons</HI> who had lately pos∣sessed themselves of it. The <HI>Britains</HI> having returned their thanks to <HI>Anarawd</HI> presently fell to work, and Necessity giving edge to their Valour, they easily dispossessed the <HI>Saxons</HI> who were not as yet warm in their Seats. For some time they continued peaceably in this part of <HI>Wales;</HI> but <HI>Eadred</HI> Duke of <HI>Mercia,</HI> called by the <HI>Welch Edryd Wallthîr,</HI> not being able any longer to bear such an ignominious ejection, made great Preparations for the re-gaining of the said Countrey. But the Northern <HI>Britains,</HI> who had set∣tled themselves there, having intelligence of his De∣sign, for the better security of their Cattel and other Effects, removed them beyond the River <HI>Conwey,</HI> Prince <HI>Anarawd</HI> in the mean time was not idle, but drawing together all the Strength he could raise, en∣camped his Army near the Town of <HI>Conwey</HI> at a place called <HI>Cymryt,</HI> where himself and his Men having made gallant Resistance against the pressing Efforts of the <HI>Saxons;</HI> obtained a very compleat Victory. This Battel was by some called <HI>Gwaeth Cymryt Conwey,</HI> by reason that it was fought in the Township of <HI>Cym∣ryt</HI> near <HI>Conwey.</HI> But Prince <HI>Anarawd</HI> would have it called <HI>Dial Rodri,</HI> because he had there revenged the Death of his Father <HI>Rodri.</HI> In this Battel <HI>Tadwal Rodri</HI>'s Son received a wound in the Knee, which made him be denominated <HI>Tudwal Glôff</HI> ever after; but for his signal Service in this Action his Brethren bestowed up∣on him <HI>Ʋchelogoed Gwynedd.</HI> But the <HI>Britains</HI> pursuing their Victory, chased the <HI>Saxons</HI> quite out of <HI>Wales</HI> into <HI>Mercia,</HI> where having burnt and destroyed the Borders, they returned home laden with rich Spoils, and so took possession of the Country betwixt <HI>Chester</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="53"/> and <HI>Conwey,</HI> which for a long time after they peace∣ably enjoyed. But <HI>Anarawd</HI> to express his thankfulness to God for this great Victory, gave very considerable Lands and Possessions to the Collegiate Churches of <HI>Bangor</HI> and <HI>Clynnoc Vawr</HI> in <HI>Arfon.</HI> After this, those <HI>Danes</HI> that lay at <HI>Fulhenham</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> crossed the Sea to <HI>France,</HI> and passing to <HI>Paris</HI> along the River <HI>Seyn,</HI> spoiled the Country thereabouts, and vanquish∣ed the <HI>French</HI> that came against them; but in their return towards the Sea-Coast, they were met with by the <HI>Britains</HI> of <HI>Armorica,</HI> who slew the greatest part of them, and the rest confusedly endeavouring to escape to their Ships, were all drowned. One should think that the several Misfortunes the <HI>Danes</HI> sustained, first at <HI>Sandwich,</HI> then by King <HI>Alfred,</HI> and now in <HI>France,</HI> would have quite drained their Num∣ber, and utterly have rid <HI>Britain</HI> from so trouble∣some an Enemy. But like ill Weeds, the more you root them, the faster they will grow; the <HI>Danes</HI> were still supplied from abroad, and if an Army was vanquished here, another was sure to come in their room. This the <HI>Welch</HI> found too true, for not long after this famous Defeat by the <HI>Armorican Britains,</HI> the <HI>Danes</HI> not able to venture upon these, were re∣solved to revenge themselves upon their Friends of <HI>Wales,</HI> and therefore landing in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> they cruelly harassed and destroyed the Country. Nor is it strange to consider from whence such a wonder∣ful Number of <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> could come. For the Kingdom of <HI>Denmark</HI> had under it, not only <HI>Denmark,</HI> which is a small Country divided by the Sea into <HI>Insulas</HI> and <HI>Peninsulas,</HI> as that which joins up∣on <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Holsatia,</HI> called <HI>Cymbrica Chersonesus,</HI> with the Islands of <HI>Zealand</HI> and <HI>Finnen,</HI> but also <HI>Nor∣may</HI> and the large Country of <HI>Sweden,</HI> reaching to <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and almost to the <HI>North-Pole</HI> This Coun∣try being then scarce known to the World, did of a sudden pour out such a multitude of People, which like a sudden Storm unexpectedly over-ran all <HI>Europe,</HI> with a great part of the Country of <HI>Africa.</HI> From hence proceeded these <HI>Danes</HI> who annoyed <HI>England;</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="54"/> And the <HI>Normans,</HI> who conquer'd <HI>France;</HI> both Na∣tions being originally derived from the same Stock.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="890" UNIT="A.D."/> The <HI>Danes</HI> had not appeared in <HI>England</HI> for some time, and therefore are now resolved to take so sure a footing, as they cannot easily be repulsed. Two Hundred and Fifty Sail being landed at <HI>Lymene</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> hard by the great Forest of <HI>Andreslege,</HI> they built the Castle of <HI>Auldre</HI> or <HI>Apledore.</HI> The same time <HI>Hasting</HI> with a Fleet of Eighty Sail ventured to the <HI>Thames</HI> mouth, and built the Castle of <HI>Mydlton;</HI> ha∣ving first made an Oath to King <HI>Alfred,</HI> not to molest him or any of his Subjects: But having built the Ca∣stle of <HI>Beamfleet,</HI> he thought himself to have obtain'd so great a Strength, that there was no necessity of ob∣serving the Oath lately sworn to King <HI>Alfred,</HI> and therefore invaded the Country round about him. But he soon found his Mistake, and was forced to betake himself back to his Castle, which was quickly pulled down upon his Head, and his Wife and two Sons ta∣ken Prisoners; who being christened, were again re∣stored to their Father. Upon this <HI>Hasting</HI> and his <HI>Danes</HI> departed from <HI>England,</HI> and made their way for <HI>France;</HI> where laying siege to the City of <HI>Limo∣gis,</HI> and despairing of a speedy surrender of it, betook himself to his usual way of dealing sinistrously, and devised this Trick to win the Town. He feigned himself to be dangerously sick, and sent to the Bishop, and the Consul of the City, desiring of them most ear∣nestly, that he might be admitted to the Christian Faith, and be baptized before his departure out of this World. The Bishop and Consul suspecting no De∣ceit, were very glad, not only to be delivered from the present danger of being besieged, but also to win so great a Person to the Congregation of Christ. Whereupon a firm Peace being concluded betwixt both Nations, <HI>Hasting</HI> is baptized, the Bishop and Consul being his Godfathers; which being ended, he was carried back by his Soldiers to his Ships, in a very infirm condition, as he outwardly pretended. About midnight he caused himself with his Arms about him to be laid on a Bier, and commanded his
<PB N="41" REF="54"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldiers to carry their Weapons with them under <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir Coats, and so to be ready when he should give <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em the word. The next day, all things being in readiness, he was solemnly brought by his Soldiers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith great Clamour and counterfeit Mourning, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terr'd in the chief Church of the City; where the shop and Consul, accompanied with all the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nourable Members of the Town, came to honour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Funeral. But when the Bishop had made himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ady to bury the Body, and all the Citizens being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Church, up starts <HI>Hasting</HI> with his Sword <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>awn, and killing first the Bishop and the Consul, af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rwards fell in with his armed Soldiers upon the na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed People, putting all to the Sword, and sparing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either Age, Sex, nor Infirmity.

<P>Whilst <HI>Howel Dha</HI> is thus regulating the Cu∣stoms, and meliorating the Laws and Constitutions of <HI>Wales; Aulafe</HI> and <HI>Regnald</HI> Kings of the <HI>Danes</HI> forci∣bly entered the Country of King <HI>Edmund,</HI> who be∣ing vexed with their incessant Hostility, gathered his Forces together, and (as some say) by the help of <HI>Lhewelyn ap Sitsylht,</HI> who was afterwards Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> followed them to <HI>Northumberland;</HI> and ha∣ving overcome them in a pitch'd Battel, utterly cha∣sed them out of his Kingdom, and remained a whole Year in those Parts, to regulate and bring that Coun∣try to some quiet order. But finding it impractica∣ble to reduce the Inhabitants of <HI>Cumberland</HI> to any peaceable Constitution, having spoiled and wasted the Country, he gave it up to <HI>Malcolme</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon condition that he should send him Succours in <MILESTONE N="942" UNIT="A.D."/> his Wars, whenever demanded of him. In the mean time the <HI>Welch</HI> had but little occasion to rejoyce; <HI>Hu∣bert</HI> Bishop of S. <HI>Davids, Marclois</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> <MILESTONE N="944" UNIT="A.D."/> and <HI>Ʋssa</HI> the Son of <HI>Lhafyr</HI> being dead: And shortly after the <HI>English</HI> entering into <HI>Wales</HI> with a very strong Army, put the Country into a great consternation; but being satisfied with the Destruction and Spoil of <HI>Strat Clwyd,</HI> they returned home without doing any more Mischief. The same time <HI>Conan</HI> the Son of <HI>Elis</HI> was like to be treacherously put to death by Poyson; and <HI>Everus</HI> Bishop of S. <HI>Davids</HI> dyed. The
<PB N="53" REF="60"/> next Year <HI>Edmund</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> was unluckily slain upon S. <HI>Augustines</HI> day; but the manner of his Death is variously delivered; some say, that disco∣vering a noted Thief who was out-law'd, sitting among his Guests, being transported with Indigna∣tion against so confident a Villain, ran upon him ve∣ry furiously, who expecting nothing less than Death, thought to dye not unrevenged, and therefore with a short Dagger gave the King a mortal Wound in the Breast. Others report, that as the King would have rescued a Servant of his from an Officer who had ar∣rested him, he was unwittingly and unhappily slain by the same. But however his Death happened, he lies buried at <HI>Glastenbury;</HI> in whose place his Brother <HI>Edred</HI> was crowned King of <HI>England,</HI> who no sooner had entered upon his Government, but he made an Expedition against <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> which being subdued, he received Fealty and Homage by Oath of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> which they did not long observe. Shortly after <HI>Howel Dha,</HI> after a <MILESTONE N="948" UNIT="A.D."/> long and peaceable Reign over <HI>Wales,</HI> dyed, much la∣mented and bewailed of all his Subjects, being a Prince of a religious and a virtuous inclination, and one that ever regarded the Welfare and Prosperity of his Peo∣ple. He left Issue behind him, <HI>Owen, Run, Roderic,</HI> and <HI>Edwyn,</HI> betwixt whom and the Sons of <HI>Edwal Foel,</HI> late Prince of <HI>North Wales,</HI> great Wars and Commotions arose afterwards about the chief Rule and Government of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>But the Sons of <HI>Howel Dha,</HI> as some Writers record, were these, <HI>viz.

Indeed, they had been wrong∣fully kept out of the Government of <HI>North Wales</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Howel;</HI> in whose time the reco∣very of their own was impracticable, by reason that for his Moderation and other good Qualities, he had attracted to himself the universal Love of all the <HI>Welch.</HI> But now, he being gone, they are resolved to revenge the Injury received by him upon his Sons; and upon a
<PB N="55" REF="61"/> small pretence, endeavour to reduce the whole Coun∣try of <HI>Wales</HI> to their own subjection. <HI>Ievaf</HI> and <HI>Ia∣go</HI> were indeed descended from the elder branch; but since <HI>Roderic</HI> the great conferred the Principality of <HI>South Wales</HI> upon his yonger Son <HI>Cadelh,</HI> the Father of <HI>Howel Dha,</HI> it was but just his Sons should enjoy what was legally descended to them by their Father: But Ambition seldom gives place to Equity; and there∣fore, right or wrong, <HI>Ievaf</HI> and <HI>Iago</HI> must have a touch for <HI>South-Wales,</HI> which they enter with a great Army; and being opposed, they obtained a very op∣portune Victory over <HI>Owen</HI> and his Brethren the Sons of <HI>Howel,</HI> at the Hills of <HI>Carno.</HI> The next Year the <MILESTONE N="950" UNIT="A.D."/> two Brothers entred twice into <HI>South-Wales,</HI> destroyed and wasted <HI>Dyfet,</HI> and slew <HI>Dwnwalhon</HI> Lord of the Countrey. Shortly after which, <HI>Roderic</HI> the third <MILESTONE N="951" UNIT="A.D."/> Son of <HI>Howel Dha</HI> dyed. But his Brethren perceiving the Folly of standing only upon the defensive, mu∣ster'd <MILESTONE N="952" UNIT="A.D."/> all their Forces together, and entering <HI>North-Wales,</HI> marched as far as <HI>Lhanrwst</HI> upon the River <HI>Conwy;</HI> where <HI>Ievaf</HI> and <HI>Iago</HI> met them. A very cruel Battel ensued upon this, and a very great number were slain on both sides, among whom were <HI>Anarawd</HI> the Son of <HI>Gwyriad,</HI> the Son of <HI>Roderic</HI> the Great; and <HI>Edwyn</HI> the Son of <HI>Howel Dha.</HI> But the Victory plainly favoured the Brothers <HI>Ievaf</HI> and <HI>Iago;</HI> so that the Princes of <HI>South-Wales</HI> were obliged to re∣tire to <HI>Cardiganshire,</HI> whither they were warmly pur∣sued, and that Country cruelly harrass'd with Fire and Sword.

<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Northumbrians</HI> having lately sworn Allegiance to King <HI>Edred,</HI> he was scarce returned to his own Country, but <HI>Aulafe,</HI> with a great Army, landed in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and was with much rejoy∣cing received by the Inhabitants. But before he could secure himself in the Government, he was shamefully banished the Country; and so the <HI>Northumbrians</HI> ele∣cted one <HI>Hircius,</HI> the Son of <HI>Harold</HI> for their King. But to shew the Inconstancy of an unsettled Multitude,
<PB N="56" REF="62"/> they soon grew weary of <HI>Hircius,</HI> and after Three Years space expelled him, and voluntarily submitted themselves to <HI>Edred,</HI> who after he had reigned eight Years, dyed, and was buried at <HI>Winchester.</HI> To him succeeded <HI>Edwin</HI> the Son of <HI>Edmund,</HI> a Man so im∣moderately given to Venety, that he forcibly married another Man's Wife; for which, and other Irregulari∣ties, his Subjects, after four Years reign, set up his Brother <HI>Edgar,</HI> who was crowned in his stead; with <MILESTONE N="958" UNIT="A.D."/> grief of which, he soon ended his days. The Sum∣mer, that same Year, proved so immoderately hot, that it caused a very dismal Plague in the following Spring, which swept away a great number of People; before which, <HI>Gwgan</HI> the Son of <HI>Gwyriad</HI> the Son of <HI>Roderie</HI> dyed.

<P><HI>IAgo ap Edwal</HI> being killed, <HI>Gruffydh ap Lhewelyn</HI> was received with loud Acclamations, and joy∣fully saluted Prince of <HI>North-Wales;</HI> who treading in his Father's steps, behaved himself in his Government with that Prudence and Conduct, that he manfully defended his Country from the frequent Invasions of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Danes:</HI> For he was scarce settled in his Throne, when these inveterate Enemies of the <HI>Welch</HI> entered in an hostile manner into <HI>Wales,</HI> and advanced as far as <HI>Crosford</HI> upon the <HI>Severn,</HI> where <HI>Gruffydh</HI> met them, and forced them shamefully to fly,
<PB N="85" REF="77"/> and retire back to their own Country. From thence <HI>Gruffydh</HI> passed to <HI>Lhanbadarn Vawr</HI> in <HI>Cardiganshire,</HI> which he laid in Ashes; and afterwards marched through all the Country of <HI>South Wales,</HI> receiving of the People Oaths of Fidelity and Subjection to him. In the mean time, <HI>Howel ap Edwyn</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales</HI> fled to <HI>Edwyn</HI> Brother to <HI>Leofric</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> and prevailed with him to come with an Army con∣sisting of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> to his aid against <HI>Gruf∣fydh,</HI> who meeting his Enemies in the Field, easily overcame them, <HI>Edwyn</HI> being slain upon the spot, and <HI>Howel</HI> forced to preserve his Life by flight. After which Victory, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> having reduced all the Country of <HI>Wales</HI> to subjection, returned again to <HI>North Wales.</HI> But <HI>Howel</HI> as soon as he could recover himself, and <MILESTONE N="1039" UNIT="A.D."/> recruit his Army, entred again into <HI>South-Wales,</HI> in∣tending the recovery of that Principality, which he was now so well assur'd of, that he brought his Wife with him to the Field, to let her see how easily he could conquer and overcome Prince <HI>Gruffydh.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too great an assurance of Victory seldom proves pros∣perous, which <HI>Howel</HI> presently experienced; for <HI>Gruf∣fydh</HI> meeting with him at <HI>Pencadair,</HI> gave him so warm an Entertainment, that he was forced presently to take his Heels, which however could not so well secure him, but that he was narrowly pursued, and his Wife who was to be entertained with the Conquest of <HI>Gruf∣fydh,</HI> on the contrary, saw her self taken Prisoner by him, and forced to comply so far to his humour, as to be his Concubine.</P>
<P>The same time <HI>Harold</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> died, and was succeeded by his Brother <HI>Hardycnute,</HI> a Prince very famous for Hospitality, and a great lover of good Chear, having his Table covered four times a day, with great plenty and variety of Dishes, with other Superfluities for all Comers.

This Message by no means pleased Earl <HI>Godwyn,</HI> a Man of great sway now in <HI>England;</HI> who knowing <HI>Alfred</HI> to be a person of
<PB N="86" REF="78"/> greater spirit than to permit him to domineer as he pleased, endeavoured all he could to dissuade the <HI>En∣glish</HI> from sending for <HI>Alfred.</HI> He shewed them how dangerous it was to permit a warlike Nation to take root in their Country, and how well <HI>Alfred</HI> was ac∣companied with <HI>Normans,</HI> to whom he had promised the chief Places and Rule of the Kingdom; by which and other like Insinuations he so disgusted the <HI>English</HI> Nobility against the <HI>Normans,</HI> that to diminish their number, they put every tenth Man to death. But seeing this was not sufficient, they acted the same part over again, and tythed them the second time; and being highly enraged against the <HI>Normans,</HI> they lead <HI>Alfred,</HI> who had brought them over, from <HI>Gilford,</HI> where this Execution was committed, to <HI>Gillingham,</HI> where ha∣ving put out his Eyes, they removed him to <HI>Ely,</HI> and there at length pitifully murthered him. Then they sent for <HI>Edward</HI> out of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and made him King, who according to his promise to Earl <HI>Godwyn,</HI> married <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Daughter <HI>Edith,</HI> a Lady much commended not only for Beauty, Modesty, and other feminine Quali∣fications, but also beyond what is requisite for a Wo∣man, Learning. But King <HI>Edward</HI> did not deal so fa∣vourably with her Brother <HI>Swane,</HI> Son to Earl <HI>Godwyn,</HI> who upon some Distaste was banished <HI>England,</HI> and thereupon forced to betake himself to <HI>Baldwyn</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> by whom he was very honourably received.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1041" UNIT="A.D."/> These Troubles and Revolutions in <HI>England</HI> were succeeded by others of no less consequence in <HI>Wales.</HI> For <HI>Howel,</HI> not brooking to be kept so shamefully out of his Kingdom, returns again the third time into <HI>South-Wales,</HI> where he had not continued long, but a great number of Strangers landed in the West of <HI>Wales,</HI> and advancing farther into the Country, pil∣laged and destroyed all places they came to <HI>Howel,</HI> tho desirous to reserve his Army to fight with Prince <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> yet could not behold his Country so misera∣bly wasted and over-run by Strangers; and thinking moreover, that by so charitable an Action he should win the universal Love of the <HI>South-Wales</HI> Men, drew up his Forces against them, and overtaking them at
<PB N="87" REF="78"/> <HI>Pwll Fynach,</HI> forced them with much loss, to retire to their Ships; which Action was call'd in <HI>Welch, Gwaith Pwll Fynach.</HI> At the same time <HI>Conan</HI> the Son of <HI>Iago ap Edwal,</HI> who was forced for fear of Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> to flee to <HI>Ireland,</HI> with the Forces of <HI>Alfred</HI> King of <HI>Dublin,</HI> whose Daugher named <HI>Ra∣nulph</HI> he had married, landed in <HI>North-Wales;</HI> and having by some treacherous Stratagem taken <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> triumphantly carried him Prisoner towards his Ships. This unhappy accident being discovered, and publick∣ly known, the <HI>North Wales</HI> Men did rise on a sudden, and so unexpectedly overtook the <HI>Irish,</HI> that they ea∣sily recover'd their Prince, and drove his Enemies with great slaughter to their Ships; who, without any far∣ther consultation, were glad to strike sail with <HI>Conan</HI> for <HI>Ireland.</HI> And now <HI>Wales,</HI> both North and South, is free from all foreign Invasion, and <HI>Howel,</HI> as yet too weak to dispute his Title with <HI>Gruffydh;</HI> so that <MILESTONE N="1042" UNIT="A.D."/> the next Year could be subject to no great Action, in which nothing happen'd remarkable, saving the death of <HI>Howel</HI> the Son of <HI>Owen</HI> Lord of <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> a Man of great Quality and Esteem in <HI>Wales.</HI> But as <MILESTONE N="1043" UNIT="A.D."/> soon as <HI>Howel</HI> could call in his <HI>Danes,</HI> to whom he added all the Forces he could raise in <HI>South-Wales;</HI> he intended presently to march against Prince <HI>Gruffydh.</HI> But he being aware aforehand to what end those Le∣vies were designed, prepared against the ensuing storm; and to avert the War from his own Country, marched courageously to <HI>South Wales,</HI> not fearing to face an Enemy whom he had shamefully vanquished twice already. Both Armies being joyned, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> easily overcame, and pursued <HI>Howel</HI> as far as the Spring-Head of the River <HI>Towy,</HI> where after a long and a bloody Fight, <HI>Howel</HI> was at last slain, and his Army so universally routed, that few escaped with their Lives. But though <HI>Howel</HI> was dead, yet there re∣mained still more Pretenders to the Principality of <HI>South-Wales;</HI> so that <HI>Gruffydh</HI> was in no great pro∣spect to enjoy the same peaceably: For as soon as it was published that <HI>Howel</HI>'s Army was defeated, and himself slain; <HI>Rytherch</HI> and <HI>Rhys</HI> the Sons of <HI>Rytherch
<PB N="88" REF="79"/> ap Iestyn</HI> put in their claim to <HI>South-Wales</HI> in right of their Father, who had once enjoyed the Sovereignty of that Country. And in order to the recovery of the same, they drew together a great Army, consist∣ing partly of Strangers and partly of such as they could raise in <HI>Gwentland</HI> and <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> and marched to fight with <HI>Gruffydh.</HI> The Prince according to his usual manner detracted no time, but animating and solacing his Soldiers with the remembrance of their former Victories and Conquests, bid the Enemies bat∣tel, which proved so very bloody and terrible, that nothing could part them beside the darkness of the Night. This Battel so tired and tamed both Armies, that neither was very desirous of another Engagement, and so one being unwilling to set upon the other, they both agreed to return to their own Habitations. The same time <HI>Joseph</HI> Bishop of <HI>Teilo</HI> or <HI>Llandaf</HI> died at <HI>Rome.</HI> But both Armies being separated, Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> enjoyed a quiet and unmolested Possession of all <HI>Wales</HI> for about Two Years; after which, the Gentry of <HI>Ystrad Towy</HI> treacherously slew 140 of the choice of his Army, which he took in so high an in∣dignation, that to revenge their death he destroyed all <HI>Dyfed</HI> and <HI>Ystrad Towy.</HI></P>
<P>About the same time, <HI>Lothen</HI> and <HI>Hyrling</HI> two <HI>Da∣nish</HI> Pyrats, with a great number of <HI>Danes,</HI> landed at <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and having plundered the Town, return∣ed again to their Ships, and sailed for <HI>Holland,</HI> where they sold the Booty they had taken, and then return∣ed to their own Country. Shortly afterwards Earl <HI>Swayn</HI> came out of <HI>Denmark</HI> with Eight Ships, and returned to <HI>England,</HI> and coming to his Fathers House at <HI>Pevenese,</HI> humbly requested of him, and his Brothers <HI>Harold</HI> and <HI>Tostie,</HI> to endeavour his reconciliation with the King. Earl <HI>Beorned</HI> too promised to intercede for him, and going to <HI>Swayn</HI>'s Fleet to sail to <HI>Sandwich,</HI> where the King then lay, he was by the way most treacherously and ungratefully murthered, and his Bo∣dy cast upon the shoar, which lay there exposed, till his Friends heating of the Fact, came and carried it to <HI>Winchester,</HI> and buried it by the Body of King <HI>Cnute,

<P><MILESTONE N="1066" UNIT="A.D."/> The year following, King <HI>Edward</HI> died, and was buried at <HI>Westminster,</HI> being the last King of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Blood before the Conquest that Governed the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> which from <HI>Cerdic</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> had continued 544, and from <HI>Egbert</HI> the first Monarch, 171 Years. <HI>Edward</HI> being dead, the next debate was about an Election of a Successor, <HI>Edgar Edeling</HI> being set up by some, as lawful Heir to the Crown, which <HI>Harold</HI> as being a Person of greater Power and Authority in the Kingdom, much wealthier and better befriended, presently thwarted, and brought Matters so cunningly about, that him∣self was chosen King, without any regard observed to the Oath and Promise he had formerly made to <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy.</HI> Duke <HI>William</HI> upon notice of <HI>Harold</HI>'s advancement, how that he had ac∣cepted of the Crown of <HI>England</HI> contrary to the Articles between them, convened together his No∣bles, and laid before them the several Wrongs and Affronts be had received at the Hands of <HI>Harold,</HI> as the Death of his Cosin <HI>Alfred,</HI> the Banishment of Archbishop <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl <HI>Odan</HI> and all the <HI>Normans,</HI> and lastly the Breach of his Oath and Promise.

Duke <HI>William</HI>'s Pretence seemed plausible enough to the <HI>Norman</HI> Nobility, but the Difficulty of the Under∣taking
<PB N="99" REF="84"/> and the Danger of this Expedition was some∣thing perplexive, and made them less inclinable to encourage so precipitous an Undertaking; which they the more disliked upon the persuasion of <HI>William Fitzosbert</HI> the Duke's Sewer, whom they pitched upon to deliver their thoughts as to the Expedition, unto the Duke. But he instead of disswading him from this Voyage, politickly declared that himself with all his Power were ready to live and die with him in this Expedition, which the rest hearing, could not but offer the Duke their Service in the same manner; and so all things were prepared for an Invasion of <HI>England.</HI> In the mean while <HI>Tosty</HI> full of Indigna∣tion at his Brother's advancement to the Crown, en∣tered the River <HI>Humber</HI> with forty Sail, but meeting with Earl <HI>Edwyn</HI> who came to oppose him, he was forced after a considerable Encounter to bear off, and secure himself by flight. But meeting with <HI>Harold</HI> King of <HI>Norway</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI> com∣ing for <HI>England</HI> with 300 Sail, he joined his Forces with <HI>Harold,</HI> and so both together entring the <HI>Humber,</HI> they landed their Army and marched to <HI>York,</HI> where the Earls <HI>Edwyn</HI> and <HI>Marcher</HI> unsuccessfully gave them Battel. Having pillaged and destroyed that City, they passed on to <HI>Stamford</HI>-Bridge, and there met with King <HI>Harold,</HI> who with a well disciplined Army was come to stop their farther carreer. After a long and a terrible Fight, and much blood-shed on both sides, the <HI>Norwegians</HI> began at last to give back, which the <HI>English</HI> perceiving, sell on so manfully, that few or none escaped with their Lives, <HI>Harold</HI> and <HI>Tosty</HI> being also slain upon the spot. One of the <HI>Norwegians</HI> is deservedly recorded for his incompa∣rable Exploits performed in this Battel, who with in∣credible Valour maintaining the Bridge against the whole Strength of the <HI>English</HI> Army for above an hour with his single Resistance delayed their Victo∣ry, and having slain a great number of his Enemies, he seemed invincible, till in the end, no one daring to grapple with him fairly, he was run through with a Spear from under the Bridge, and so by his fall, a

The Duke dividing his Army into five Batta∣lions, made a long harangue to his Soldiers, wherein he repeated and commended the Noble Acts of their Ancestors the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Norwegians,</HI> who had perpe∣tually vanquished the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and other Nations, as many as they had to do with; how that themselves being well Horsed and Armed, were now to engage with a People void of both, who had no other Defence to trust to than the nimbleness and swiftness of their Heels.

But the King upon his return from <HI>Normandy,</HI> presently marched to the <HI>North,</HI> and having sufficiently revenged himself upon the Inhabitants, by wasting and destroying their Country, chased <HI>Edgar</HI> to <HI>Scotland</HI> again.

Whereupon <HI>Richard Fitzscrope</HI> Governor of the Castle of <HI>Here∣ford,</HI> with the Forces under his Command so bitterly gauled him, by wasting and consuming his Lands, and carrying off the Goods of his Tenants, that he was compelled to desire Aid of <HI>Blethyn</HI> and <HI>Rywalhon</HI> Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> by whose help, to recompence the Loss he had received, he passed into <HI>Hereford,</HI> and after that he had over-run and pillaged the Country to <HI>Wyebridge,</HI> returned back with exceeding great Booty.

There fell

<P>The Lordship of <HI>Glamorgan</HI> reaches in length 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Miles, even from <HI>Rymny-Bridge</HI> to the East, to <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Conan</HI> Westward; and in breadth from <HI>Aberth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> otherwise <HI>Aberdaon</HI> on the South-part, to the Con∣fines of <HI>Brecnockshire</HI> above <HI>Morleys</HI> Castle, 22 Miles This being a Royal Lordship, the Lords thereof ow∣ing no other Subjection than Obedience only to the Crown, assumed to themselves all the Priviledges of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> regal Court, excepting only the pardoning of Crimi∣nals in case of Treason. And not only <HI>Glamorgan</HI> but the several petty Lordships of which it consisted namely, <HI>Sengennyth, Myscyn, Ruthin, Lhanbleth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Tir Iarlh, Glyn Rothney, Avan, Neth, Coyty, Talava</HI> and <HI>Lantuit</HI> or <HI>Boviarton;</HI> exercised the same Prive¦lege of <HI>Jura Regalia,</HI> with this difference only, that in case of wrong Judgment in these Courts, appe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> might be made in the County-Court of <HI>Glamorgan</HI> which being superiour to the rest, had power to re∣verse any Judgment given in them. Within th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lordship were 18 Castles, and 36 Knights Fees, besides the Town and Castle of <HI>Kynfig,</HI> the Town of <HI>Cowbridge</HI> or <HI>Pont Vaen,</HI> and the Town and Castle of <HI>Caerdàf;</HI> in the latter of which the Lord of <HI>Gla∣morgan</HI> chiefly resided, wherein the County-Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="115" REF="93"/> was monthly kept. The annual Revenue of this Lord∣ship amounted to a Thousand Marks; whereof Four Hundred was allowed for the Fees and Sallary of the several Officers belonging to the same. This Lord∣ship of <HI>Glamorgan Robert Fitzhamon</HI> kept to himself; and the others he distributed between his several Fol∣lowers; namely, to <HI>William de Londres</HI> he gave the Castle and Mannor of <HI>Ogmore;</HI> to <HI>Richard Greenfield</HI> the Lordship of <HI>Neth;</HI> to <HI>Paine Turberville</HI> that of <HI>Coyty;</HI> to <HI>Robert S Quintine Lhan Blechyan;</HI> to <HI>Richard Syward Talavan;</HI> to <HI>Gilbert Humfrevile</HI> the Castle and Mannor of <HI>Penmarc;</HI> to <HI>Reginald Sully</HI> the Castle and Mannor of <HI>Sully;</HI> to <HI>Roger Berkrolles</HI> that of <HI>East Or∣chard;</HI> to <HI>Peter le Scor</HI> that of <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erton;</HI> to <HI>John Fle∣ming</HI> that of S. <HI>George;</HI> to <HI>John S.

<P>But about the same time that <HI>Robert Fitzhamon</HI> took the Lordship of <HI>Glamorgan, Barnard Newmarch</HI> a Nobleman likewise of <HI>Normandy,</HI> obtained by Con∣quest the Lordship of <HI>Brecknock;</HI> and <HI>Henry de New∣burgh</HI> Son to <HI>Roger de Bellemont,</HI> by the Conquerour made Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Country of <HI>Gower.</HI> But <HI>Barnard Newmarch</HI> gave the People of <HI>Wales</HI> some small Satisfaction and Content, by marrying <HI>Nest,</HI> the Daughter also of <HI>Nest,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Lhewelyn ap Gruffydh</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> by whom he had Issue, a Son called <HI>Mahael.</HI> This worthy Gentleman being legally to succeed his Father in the Lordship of <HI>Breck∣nock,</HI> was afterwards disinherited by the Malice and Baseness of his own unnatural Mother. The occa∣sion was thus, <HI>Nest</HI> happening to fall in admiration of a certain Knight, with whom she had more than ordinary Familiarity, even beyond what she exprest to her own Husband; <HI>Mahael</HI> perceiving her dissolute
<PB N="116" REF="94"/> and loose Behaviour, counselled her to take care of her Fame and Reputation, and to leave off that scan∣dalous Liberty which she took; and afterwards meeting casually her Gallant coming from her, fought and grievously wounded him. Upon this, <HI>Nest</HI> to be revenged upon her Son, went to <HI>Henry</HI> the First King of <HI>England,</HI> and in his presence took her corporal Oath, that her Son <HI>Mahael</HI> was illegiti∣mate, and not begot by <HI>Barnard Newmarch</HI> her Hus∣band, but another Person; by virtue of which Oath, or rather Perjury, <HI>Mahael</HI> was disinherited, and his Sister, whom her Mother attested to be legiti∣mate, was bestowed by the King upon <HI>Milo,</HI> the Son of <HI>Walter Constable,</HI> afterward Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> who in right of his Wife enjoyed the whole estate of <HI>Bar∣nard Newmarch</HI> Lord of <HI>Brecnock.</HI> Of this <HI>Milo</HI> it is reported, that telling King <HI>Henry</HI> of a strange Acci∣dent which had occurred to him by <HI>Lhyn Savathan</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> where the Birds upon the Pond at the passing by of <HI>Gruffydh</HI> the Son of <HI>Rhys ap Theodor,</HI> seemed by their chirping to be in a manner overjoy'd; The King replyed, It was not so wonderful; for al∣though, says he, we have violently and injuriously oppressed that Nation, yet it is manifestly known, that they are the lawful and original Inheritors of that Country.</P>
<P>But whilst the <HI>Normans</HI> were thus carving for themselves in <HI>Glamorgan</HI> and <HI>Brecnock, Cadogan ap Blethyn ap Confyn</HI> towards the end of <HI>April,</HI> entered into <HI>Dyved,</HI> and having ravaged and destroyed the Country, returned back. But within Eight Weeks after, there succeeded him a more fatal Enemy; for the <HI>Normans</HI> landing in <HI>Dyved</HI> and <HI>Cardigan,</HI> began to fortifie themselves in Castles and other strong pla∣ces, and to inhabit the Country upon the Sea-shoar, which before was not in their possession. Indeed the <HI>Normans</HI> having by the connivance of the Conquerour already got into their hands all the best Estates in <HI>England,</HI> began now to spy out the Commodities of <HI>Wales;</HI> and perceiving moreover how bravely <HI>Robert Fitzhamon</HI> and <HI>Barnard Newmarch</HI> had sped there,
<PB N="117" REF="94"/> thought they might as well expect the like fortune. Wherefore having obtained a Grant from King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> (who readily consented to their Request, because by this means he killed two Birds with one Stone, procured to himself their utmost Service upon occasion, and withal provided for them without any Charge to himself) they came to <HI>Wales,</HI> and so entered upon the Estates appointed them by the King, which they held of him by Knight-service, having first done Homage and sworn Fealty for the same. <HI>Roger Montgomery</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> did Homage for the Lordships of <HI>Powis</HI> and <HI>Card gan; Hugh Lupus</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> for <HI>Tegengl</HI> and <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fonioc,</HI> together with all the Land lying upon the Sea shoar to the River <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nwey; Arnulph</HI> a younger Son of <HI>Roger Montgomery</HI> for <HI>Dyved; Barnard Newmarch</HI> for <HI>Brecnock; Ralph Mortimer</HI> for <HI>Eluel; Hugh de Lacy</HI> for the Land of <HI>Ewyas; Eustace Omer</HI> for <HI>Mold</HI> and <HI>Hapredale;</HI> and several others did the like Homage for other Lands. But <HI>Roger Montgomery,</HI> who by the Conquerour was created Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> entered in an hostile manner into <HI>Powys-land,</HI> and having won the Castle and Town of <HI>Baldwyn,</HI> fortified it in his own right, and called it <HI>Montgomery</HI> after his own Name. King <HI>William</HI> of <HI>England</HI> was now in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and busily engaged in a War against his Brother <HI>Robert;</HI> by the advan∣tage of whose absence, <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Cadogan ap Blethyn,</HI> who now rul∣ed in <HI>South Wales,</HI> with joynt Forces entered into <HI>Cardigan</HI> and slew a great number of <HI>Normans,</HI> whose Pride and excessive Cruelties towards the <HI>Welch,</HI> were altogether intolerable. But after sufficient execu∣tion there, being returned home, the <HI>Normans</HI> sent for more Aid from <HI>England;</HI> which being arrived, they thought to make a private in-road into <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and so to be revenged upon the <HI>Welch.</HI> But their Design being happily discovered to <HI>Cadogan,</HI> he drew up his Forces to meet them, and then unexpe∣ctedly setting upon them in the Forest of <HI>Yspys,</HI> after a very warm Resistment of the <HI>Normans</HI> side, for∣ced them to retire by slight, and then triumphantly
<PB N="118" REF="95"/> marching through <HI>Cardigan</HI> and <HI>Dyved,</HI> he destroyed all the Castles and Fortifications in the Country, be∣sides <HI>Pembrock</HI> and <HI>Rydcors,</HI> which proved too strong, and impregnable.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1093" UNIT="A.D."/> The next Year the <HI>Normans</HI> who inhabited the Country of <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> fell upon and destroyed the Countries of <HI>Gwyr, Kidwely:</HI> and <HI>Ys<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>âd Tywy,</HI> which they harrassed in such a cruel manner, that they left them bare of any People to inhabit. And to increase, as it was thought, the Miseries of the <HI>Welch,</HI> King <HI>William Rufus</HI> being informed of the great slaughter which <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan,</HI> and the Sons of <HI>Blethyn ap Confyn</HI> had lately committed upon the <HI>English,</HI> as well within <HI>Cheshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire,</HI> and <HI>He∣refordshire,</HI> as within <HI>Wales;</HI> entered the Country at <HI>Montgomery,</HI> which place the <HI>Welch</HI> having sometime since demolished, King <HI>William</HI> lately rebuilt. But the <HI>Welch</HI> kept all the Passages through the Woods and Rivers, and all other Streights so close, that the King could effect nothing considerable against them; and therefore when he perceived that his labour was but lost, in continuing in those Parts, he forthwith decamped, and returned with no great Honour back to <HI>England.</HI> But this retreat of King <HI>William</HI> was not altogether so favourable to the Interest of the <MILESTONE N="1094" UNIT="A.D."/><HI>Welch,</HI> as the death of <HI>William Fitz-Baldwyn,</HI> who was Owner of the Castle of <HI>Rydcors,</HI> and did the greatest mischief and hurt to the <HI>South-Wales</HI> Men of any other. He being dead, the Garrison of <HI>Rydcors</HI> which was wont to keep the <HI>Welch</HI> in continual a we, forsook that place, and by that means gave op∣portunity to the Inhabitants of <HI>Gwyr, Brecnock, Gwent,</HI> and <HI>Gwentlhwe,</HI> to shake off that intolerable Yoak the <HI>Normans</HI> forced upon them, who after they had rob'd them of their Lands, kept them in perpetual subje∣ction. But now <HI>William Fitz-Baldwyn</HI> being dead, and the Garrison of <HI>Rydcors</HI> scatter'd, they ventur'd to lay violent hands upon the <HI>Normans,</HI> who thought themselves free from all fear; and prevailed so suc∣cessfully, that they drove them all out of the Coun∣trey, and recover'd their own antient Estates. But
<PB N="119" REF="95"/> the <HI>Normans</HI> liked that Country so well, that they were resolved not to be so easily befooled out of what they had with a great deal of Pains and Dan∣ger once possessed; and therefore having drawn a great number of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> to their aid, they were desirous to venture another touch with the <HI>Welch,</HI> and to return, if possible, to their once ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uir'd Habitations. But the <HI>Welch</HI> so abhorr'd their Pride and tyrannical Dominion over them when they were Masters, that they were resolved not to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e subject to such Tyrants again; and therefore they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldly met them at a place called <HI>Celly Iarfawc,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et upon them so manfully, the very apprehension of Servitude whetting their Spirits, that they put them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o flight with great slaughter, and drove them out of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Country. The <HI>Normans</HI> however were not so ab∣solutely routed with this Overthrow, but like a Fly in the night which destroys it self in the Candle, they must needs covet their own Distruction; their gree∣diness egging them on to venture with few what was not practicable to be effected by many. Therefore they came as far as <HI>Brecnock,</HI> with this absolute <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow and Resolution, not to leave one living thing remaining in that Country. But they fell short of their Policy, the People of the Country being remov∣ed to a narrow Streight, to expect their passing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough; whither the <HI>Normans</HI> being advanced, they fell upon them, and killed a great number of them. About the same time, <HI>Roger Montgomery</HI> Earl of <HI>Salop</HI> and <HI>Arundel, William Fitzeustace</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester, Arnold de Harecourt,</HI> and <HI>Neal le Vicount,</HI> were slain by the <HI>Welch</HI> between <HI>Caerdàf</HI> and <HI>Brecnock;</HI> and <HI>Walter Eureux</HI> Earl of <HI>Sarum, Rosmer,</HI> and <HI>Manti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake; Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Gourney,</HI> were wounded, who afterwards dyed in <HI>Normandy.</HI> The <HI>Normans</HI> find∣ing that they continually lost ground, thought it not advisable to stay any longer; and therefore having placed sufficient Garrisons in those Castles which they had formerly built, they returned with what speed they could to <HI>England.</HI> But all the haste they did make, could not secure them from the Fury of
<PB N="120" REF="96"/> the <HI>Welch;</HI> for <HI>Gruffydh</HI> and <HI>Ifor,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Ed∣nerth ap Cadogan,</HI> expected them privately at a place called <HI>Aberlhech,</HI> where falling unexpectedly upon them; they slew the greatest part of their number, the rest narrowly escaping safe to <HI>England.</HI> But the <HI>Norman</HI> Garrisons which were left behind, de∣fended themselves with a great deal of Bravery, till at last, finding no prospect of Relief, they were forced for their own safety to deliver them up to the <HI>Welch,</HI> who, from that time, became again Pro∣prietors of those Places which the <HI>Normans</HI> had dis∣possess'd them from. And this encouraged the <HI>Welch</HI> to undertake other things against the <HI>English;</HI> for immediately after this, certain of the Nobility of <HI>North-Wales, Ʋchthed</HI> the Son of <HI>Edwyn ap Grono</HI> by name, together with <HI>Howel ap Grono,</HI> and the So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <HI>Cadogan ap Blethyn</HI> of <HI>Powys-land,</HI> passed by <HI>Car∣digan</HI> into <HI>Dyved</HI> (which Country King <HI>William</HI> had given to <HI>Arnulph</HI> Son to <HI>Roger Montgomery,</HI> who had built thereon the Castle of <HI>Pembrock,</HI> and appointed <HI>Gerald de Windsore</HI> Governour of the same) and de∣stroying all the Country with Fire and Sword, ex∣cepting <HI>Pembrock</HI> Castle, which was impregnable, they returned home with a great deal of Booty.

<P><MILESTONE N="1100" UNIT="A.D."/> About two Years after, a Rebellion broke out in <HI>England; Robert de Belesmo,</HI> the Son of <HI>Roger de Montgomery</HI> Earl of <HI>Salop,</HI> and <HI>Arnulph</HI> his Brother Earl of <HI>Pembrock,</HI> took up Arms against King <HI>Henry;</HI> which he being informed of, sent them a very gra∣cious Message to come before him, and declare their Grievances, and the reason of their rising up in Arms against his Majesty. But the Earls instead of ap∣pearing in Person, sent him flight and frivolous Ex∣cuses, and in the mean while made all necessary Pre∣parations for the War, both by raising of Forces, and
<PB N="123" REF="98"/> fortifying their Castles and strong Holds. And to strengthen themselves the more, they sent rich Pre∣sents, and made large Promises to <HI>Iorwerth, Cado∣gan,</HI> and <HI>Meredith,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Blethyn ap Confyn;</HI> for to bring them to their side. <HI>Robert</HI> fortified four Castles, namely, <HI>Arundel, Tekinhil, Shrewsbury,</HI> and <HI>Brugge;</HI> which last, by reason that <HI>Robert</HI> built it with∣out the consent of the King, was the chief occasion of this War; and <HI>Arnulph</HI> fortified his Castle at <HI>Pem∣brock.</HI> After this, they entered in an hostile manner into the Territories of the King of <HI>England,</HI> wasting and destroying all before them. And to augment their strength, <HI>Arnulph</HI> sent <HI>Gerald</HI> his Steward, to <HI>Mur∣kart</HI> King of <HI>Ireland,</HI> desiring his Daughter in Wed∣lock; which was easily granted, with the Promise too of great Succours and large Supplies. King <HI>Henry,</HI> to put a stop to their bold Adventures, march∣ed in person against them; and laying siege to the Ca∣stle of <HI>Arundel,</HI> wan it without any great Opposi∣tion; and quickly afterwards the Castle of <HI>Tekinhill;</HI> but that of <HI>Brugge,</HI> by reason of the scituation of the place, and the depth of the Ditch about it, seemed to require longer time and harder service; and there∣fore King <HI>Henry</HI> was advised to send privately to <HI>Iorwerth ap Blethyn,</HI> promising him great Rewards if he forsook the Earl's part, and came over to him; urging to him, what Mischief <HI>Roger,</HI> Earl <HI>Robert</HI>'s Father, and his Brother <HI>Hugh,</HI> had continually done to the <HI>Welch-Men.</HI> And to make him the more willing to accept of his Proposals, he promised to give him all such Lands as the Earl and his Brother had in <HI>Wales,</HI> without either Tribute or Homage; which was a part of <HI>Powys, Cardigan,</HI> and half <HI>Dyfed;</HI> the other part being in the possession of <HI>William Fitz-Baldwyn. Iorwerth</HI> receiving these Offers, accepted of them very gladly, and then coming to the King, he sent all his Forces to Earl <HI>Robert</HI>'s Lands, who ha∣ving received very strict Orders, destroyed without Mercy every thing they met with; and what made the Spoil the greater, Earl <HI>Robert</HI> upon his rebelling against King <HI>Henry,</HI> had caused his People to con∣vey
<PB N="124" REF="99"/> all their Goods to <HI>Wales,</HI> for fear of the <HI>English;</HI> not thinking how his Father's Memory sounded a∣mong the <HI>Welch.</HI> But when the News of <HI>Ior∣werth</HI>'s Revolt reached the Ears of the Earl, <HI>Ca∣dogan</HI> and <HI>Meredith, Iorwerth</HI>'s Brothers; their Spirits began to faint, as despairing any longer to oppose the King, since <HI>Iorwerth,</HI> who was the Per∣son of greatest strength in <HI>Wales,</HI> had left and for∣saken them. <HI>Arnulph</HI> was gone to <HI>Ireland</HI> to fetch home his Wife, and to bring over what succour his Father in Law, King <HI>Murkart,</HI> could afford to send him; but he not coming in time, some other Method was to be tryed, how to get some Aid against the <HI>English.</HI> A little before this Rebellion broke out, <HI>Magnus, Harold</HI>'s Son, landed the second time in the Isle of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and being kindly received by <HI>Gruf∣fydh ap Conan,</HI> he had leave to cut down what Tim∣ber he had need for; and so returning to the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> which he had got by Conquest, he built there three Castles, and then sent to <HI>Ireland</HI> to have the Daughter of <HI>Murkart</HI> in marriage to his Son, which being obtained, he created him King of <HI>Man.</HI> Earl <HI>Robert</HI> hearing this, sent to <HI>Magnus</HI> for Aid against King <HI>Henry;</HI> but receiving none, he thought it now high time to look to his own Safety; and therefore he sent to the King, requesting that he might quiet∣ly depart the Kingdom, in case he should lay down his Arms; which the King having granted, he sail'd to <HI>Normandy.</HI> And then King <HI>Henry</HI> sent an Ex∣press to his Brother <HI>Arnulph,</HI> requiring him either to follow his Brother out of the Kingdom, or to de∣liver himself up to his Mercy; and so <HI>Arnulph</HI> went over also for <HI>Normandy.</HI> When the King was re∣turned to <HI>London, Iorwerth</HI> took his Brother <HI>Meredith</HI> Prisoner, and committed him to the King's custody; his other Brother <HI>Cadogan</HI> having reconciled himself beforehand, to whom <HI>Iorwerth</HI> gave <HI>Cardigan,</HI> with a part of <HI>Powys.</HI> Then <HI>Iorwerth</HI> went to <HI>London,</HI> to put the King in mind of his Promise, and the Ser∣vice he had done him against Earl <HI>Robert;</HI> but the King finding now all matters at quiet, was deaf
<PB N="125" REF="99"/> to all such Remembrances, and instead of promising what he had once voluntarily proposed, against all Rules of Equity and Gratitude, he took away <HI>Dy∣fed</HI> from <HI>Iorwerth,</HI> and gave it to a Knight of his own, called <HI>Saer;</HI> and <HI>Stratywy Cydwely,</HI> and <HI>Gwyr</HI> he bestowed upon <HI>Howel ap Grono,</HI> and sent <HI>Iorwerth</HI> away more empty than he came: Nor was this suf∣ficient Reward for his former Services; but the next Year King <HI>Henry</HI> must send some of his Coun∣sel to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and cite <HI>Iorwerth</HI> to appear there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. <HI>1101.</HI></NOTE> under pretence of consulting about the King's Busi∣ness and Affairs in those Parts. But the Plot was laid deeper; and when without any suspicion of Treachery he made his appearance, he was surprizedly attainted of High-Treason, and then contrary to all Right and Justice actually condemn'd to perpetual Imprisonment; the true reason of this unparallel'd Severity being, the King feared his Strength, and was apprehensive that he would revenge the Wrong and Affront he received at his hands. And indeed, well had he reason to fear that, when he so ungrate∣fully treated him, whose Service he had experienced to be so greatly advantagious to him. But the Po∣licy of Princes is unaccountable; and whether to value an eminent Person for his Service, or to fear him for his Greatness, is a Subject that frequently disturbs their most settled Considerations. But the Noblemen that were at this time sent by the King to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> were <HI>Richard de Belmersh,</HI> who being chief Agent about <HI>Roger Montgomery</HI> Earl of <HI>Salop,</HI> was preferred to the Bishoprick of <HI>London,</HI> and af∣terwards appointed by this King, to be Warden of the Marches, and Governour of the County of <HI>Salop.</HI> With him were joyned in company, <HI>Walter Constable,</HI> the Father of <HI>Milo,</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Rayner</HI> the King's Lieutenant in the County of <HI>Salop.</HI> About this time, as <HI>Bale</HI> writes, the Church of <HI>Menevia</HI> or S. <HI>Davids,</HI> began to be subject to the See of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> being always afore the Metropolitan Church of all <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<PB N="126" REF="100"/>
<P><MILESTONE N="1102" UNIT="A.D."/> Shortly after this, <HI>Owen ap Edwyn,</HI> who had been Author of no small Mischief and Disturbance to the <HI>Welch,</HI> in moving the <HI>English</HI> against his natural Prince, and Son in Law <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan,</HI> depart∣ed this Life, after a tedious and miserable Sickness; of which he was so much the less pityed, by how much he had proved an Enemy and a Traytor to his native Country. He was the Son of <HI>Grono,</HI> by his Wife <HI>Edelflede</HI> the Widow of <HI>Edmund,</HI> surnamed <HI>Ironside,</HI> King of <HI>England;</HI> and had the Title of <HI>Tegengl;</HI> though the <HI>English,</HI> when they had com∣pelled <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> to flee to <HI>Ireland</HI> for safety, constituted him Prince of all <HI>North-Wales.</HI> After his death, <HI>Richard Fitz-Baldwyn</HI> laid siege to, and took the Castle of <HI>Rydcors,</HI> and forcibly drove <HI>Howel ap Grono,</HI> to whom King <HI>Henry</HI> had committed the custody of it, out of the Country. But <HI>Howel</HI> quick∣ly returned, and with a high Spirit of Revenge, be∣gan to destroy and burn whatsoever he could meet with, and then meeting a Party of the <HI>Normans</HI> in their return homewards, he fell upon the flank of them with a very considerable slaughter; and so brought all the Country to his subjection, excepting some few Garrisons and Castles which would not surrender to him. The same time King <HI>Henry</HI> took away from <HI>Saer</HI> the Government of <HI>Dyfed,</HI> which formerly was <HI>Iorwerth ap Blethyn</HI>'s, and bestowed it upon <HI>Gerald,</HI> who had been some time Earl <HI>Arnulph</HI>'s Steward in those Parts; and therefore by reason of his know∣ledg of the Country, was in all probability best able to take upon him the Management of it. But the <HI>Normans</HI> in <HI>Rydcors</HI> Castle being sensible that they were not able to effect any thing against <HI>Howel ap Grono</HI> in open Field, after their accustomed manner, began to put that in execution by Treachery, which they could not compass by force of Arms. And how to make <HI>Howel</HI> a Sacrifice to those <HI>Normans</HI> he had lately slain, they could find no safer way than by corrupting one <HI>Gwgan ap Meyric,</HI> a Man in great Favour and Esteem with <HI>Howel,</HI> upon the account chiefly that one of his Children was nursed by <HI>Gwgan</HI>'s
<PB N="127" REF="100"/> Wife. This ungrateful Villain, to carry on his wick∣ed Intrigue the more unsuspected, gave <HI>Howel</HI> a very earnest invitation to his House to a Merriment, where, without any suspicion of Treachery, being come, he was welcomed with all the seeming Affection and Kindness imaginable. But no sooner was he settled,<MILESTONE N="1103" UNIT="A.D."/> but <HI>Gwgan</HI> gave notice thereof to the <HI>Norman</HI> Garri∣sons; and therefore by break of day they entered the Town, and coming about the House where <HI>Howel</HI> lay in Bed, they presently gave a great shout. <HI>Howel</HI> hearing the noise, suspected something of Mischief, and therefore leaping in all haste out of Bed, he made to his Weapons, but could not find them, by reason that <HI>Gwgan</HI> had conveyed them away whilst he was asleep. And now being assured of Treachery in the case, and finding that his Men had fled for their Lives, he endeavour'd all he could to make his escape; but <HI>Gwgan</HI> and his Company were too quick for him; and so being secured, they strangled him, and deliver'd his Body to the <HI>Normans,</HI> who having cut off his Head, convey'd it to the Castle of <HI>Rydcors.</HI> This most villainous Murther, so barbarously commit∣ted upon the King's Lieutenant, was not in the least taken notice of; for King <HI>Henry</HI> was so unreasona∣bly prejudiced in favour of the <HI>Normans,</HI> that whate∣ver Misdemeanour, be it of never so high a nature, was by them committed, it was presently winked at, and let fall to the ground; whereas, if the <HI>Welch</HI> trespassed but against the least injunction of the King's Laws, they were most severely punished: which was the cause that they afterwards stood up against the King in their own defence, being by experience assured, that he minded nothing more than their utter Destruction.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>Anselm,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> convened a Synod at <HI>London,</HI> wherein among other Injunctions then decreed, the Celibacy of the Clergy was enjoyned; Marriage being before ever allowed of in <HI>Britain,</HI> to them in Holy Orders. But this new Injunction created a great deal of Heat and Animosities among the Clergy, some approving of it
<PB N="128" REF="101"/> as reasonable and orthodoxical; others condemning it, as an innovation, and contrary to the plain Letter of Scripture. But during these Disputes between the Clergy, King <HI>Henry</HI> being now in the Fifth Year of his Reign, sailed over with a great Army into <HI>Normandy</HI> where his Brother <HI>Robert,</HI> together with <HI>Robert de Belesmo, Arnulph,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Mor∣taign,</HI> gave him battel; but the King having obtain∣ed the Victory, took the Duke his Brother, with <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Mortaign,</HI> Prisoners; and carrying them into <HI>England,</HI> he caused first his Brother <HI>Robert</HI>'s Eyes to be plucked out, and then condemned them <MILESTONE N="1104" UNIT="A.D."/> both to perpetual imprisonment in the Castle of <HI>Car∣dyff.</HI> About the same time <HI>Meyric</HI> and <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Trahaern ap Caradoc</HI> were both slain by the means of <HI>Owen ap Cadogan ap Blethyn;</HI> whose Un∣cle <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> who had been Prisoner for a long time in <HI>England,</HI> now brake open the Prison, wherein he was very narrowly confined; and return∣ing to his own Country, had his Estate restored, which afterwards he quietly enjoyed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1105" UNIT="A.D."/> The next Year a very dismal and calamitous Ac∣cident happening in the Low-Countries, proved ve∣ry incommodious and prejudicial to the <HI>Welch;</HI> for a great part of <HI>Flanders</HI> being drowned by the over∣flowing of the Sea, the Inhabitants were compell d to seek for some other Country to dwell in, their own being now covered with Water. And there∣fore a great many being come over to <HI>England,</HI> they requested of King <HI>Henry</HI> to assign them some part of his Kingdom which was empty and void of Inha∣bitants, where they might settle and plant themselves. The King taking advantage of this charitable oppor∣tunity, and being in a manner assured, that these <HI>Flemings</HI> would be a considerable Thorn in the side of the <HI>Welch,</HI> bestowed upon them very liberally what was not justly in his power to give; and ap∣pointed them the Country of <HI>Ros,</HI> in <HI>Dyfed</HI> or <HI>West-Wales,</HI> where they continue to this day. But <HI>Gerald</HI> the King's Lieutenant in those Parts, was resolved to be afore-hand with them, and rebuilt the Castle of
<PB N="129" REF="101"/> <HI>Pembrock,</HI> in a place called <HI>Congarth Fechan;</HI> whither he removed his Family and all his Goods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. <HI>1106.</HI></NOTE> But here a very unfortunate accident happened to him; for <HI>Cadwgan ap Blethyn</HI> having prepared a sumptuous Feast in the <HI>Christmas,</HI> invited all the Lords to his Country-House in <HI>Dyfed,</HI> and among the rest his Son <HI>Owen,</HI> who lived in <HI>Powys.</HI> This young Gentleman being at his Father's House, and hearing <HI>Nest</HI> the Wife of <HI>Gerald</HI> universally praised for her incomparable Beauty, was so smitten with the rumour that went abroad of her, that by all means he must see the Lady, who was by all so much admired. And forasmuch as <HI>Gwladys,</HI> Wife to <HI>Rhys ap Theodore,</HI> and Mother to <HI>Nest,</HI> was the Daughter of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>walhon ap Confyn,</HI> Cosin-German to <HI>Cadwgan</HI> his Father; under pretence of Friendship and Relation, he made bold to pay her a Visit. But finding the truth far to surpass the Fame that went of her, he returned home so inflam'd with her Charms, that not being able to keep the Mastery over himself, he went back again the very same night, and being attended by a company of wild, head-strong Youths, they privily entered into the Castle, and encompas∣sing the Chamber about, where <HI>Gerald</HI> and his Wife lay, they set the House on fire. <HI>Gerald</HI> hearing a noise, would fain go out to know the meaning of such unseasonable Disturbance; but his Wife fearing some Treachery, persuaded him to make as private an E∣scape as he could; and then pulling up a Board in the Privy, let him go that way. Then returning to her Chamber, she would fain assure those notorious Youths, that there was no body besides her self and Children there; but this being not satifactory, they forcibly broke in, and having searched every the most private Corner, and not finding <HI>Gerald,</HI> they took his Wife and two Sons, with a Son and a Daughter born by a Concubine, and carried them away to <HI>Powys;</HI> ha∣ving first set fire to the Castle, and destroyed the Country as they went along. <HI>Cadwgan, Owen</HI>'s Fa∣ther, hearing of what outragious Crime his Son had committed, was exceedingly concerned and sorry, chiefly because hereby he was like to incur King
<PB N="130" REF="102"/> <HI>Henry</HI>'s great Displeasure; and therefore he went with all speed to <HI>Powys,</HI> and desired his Son with all In∣treaties, to send home to <HI>Gerald</HI> his Wife and Chil∣dren, with whatever else he had taken away from him. But <HI>Owen</HI> was so amorously inexorable with re∣spect to the Woman, that he would by no means part with her; however, upon her request he was wil∣ling to restore <HI>Gerald</HI> his Children back again, which forthwith he performed. But when <HI>Richard</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> whom King <HI>Henry</HI> had constituted War∣den of the Marches, being now at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> heard of this, he sent for <HI>Ithel</HI> and <HI>Madoc</HI> the Sons of <HI>Ryryd ap Blethyn,</HI> Persons of great Power and Interest in <HI>Wales,</HI> promising them very considerable Reward, be∣sides the Government of the whole Country, in case they could bring <HI>Owen</HI> and his Father <HI>Cadwgan</HI> either dead or alive, to him, that he might revenge that hainous Affront which they had done to the King of <HI>England.</HI> With them he joyned <HI>Lhywarch</HI> the Son of <HI>Trahaern ap Caradoc,</HI> whose two Brethren <HI>Owen</HI> had slain, and <HI>Ʋchtryd</HI> the Son of <HI>Edwyn;</HI> which Four un∣dertook to answer effectually the Bishop's Proposal to them. But when they had united their Forces, and began in an hostile manner to destroy the Country as they passed along; <HI>Ʋchtryd</HI> sent private notice before him, requiring all who were any way desirous of their own Safety, to come to him; because no Quarters was to be given to any that was found in the Country. The People being thus so opportunely forewarned, began to bethink with themselves how they might best avoid so eminent a danger; and thereupon some fled to <HI>Arustly,</HI> others to <HI>Melienyth,</HI> some to <HI>Stradty∣wy,</HI> and some to <HI>Dyfed;</HI> but in this latter place they met with very cold welcom; for <HI>Gerald,</HI> who was then very busie in exercising Revenge upon that Coun∣try, falling in among them, cut off a considerable number of them. The like fate befel them who esca∣ped to <HI>Arustly</HI> and <HI>Melienyth;</HI> for <HI>Walter</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hereford</HI> having raised an Army in defence of the Town of <HI>Caermyrdhyn,</HI> before he could come thither, accidentally met with these stragling Fugitives, and
<PB N="131" REF="102"/> knowing what Country they belonged to, without any further Ceremony, he fell upon them, and put most of them to the Sword. But they who fled to <HI>Stradtywy,</HI> were gently received by <HI>Meredith ap Ry∣therch,</HI> and such as resorted to <HI>Ʋchtryd,</HI> were kindly entertained by him; and so he marched with the rest of his Confederates to <HI>Rydcors</HI> Castle; it being the general opinion, that it was best to enter the Country by Night, and to take <HI>Cadwgan</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> his Son by surprize. But <HI>Ʋchtryd</HI> reflecting upon the Difficulty of the Country, and how easily they might be en∣trapp'd by an Ambuscade, dissuaded them from any such nocturnal Undertakings; and told them, that it was far more advisable to enter the Country in good order, when the light gave the Soldiers opportunity to keep and observe their ranks. But whilst they were thus considering of the most effectual way to carry on their purpose, <HI>Owen</HI> got a Ship at <HI>Aberdyfi,</HI> bound for <HI>Ireland;</HI> and escaping thither, avoided the nar∣row search that was the following day made for them. But when neither Father nor Son could be found, all the fault was laid upon <HI>Ʋchtryd,</HI> who had dissuaded them from falling upon the Castle unexpectedly; and there∣fore all they could do, since their escape, was to burn and destroy the Country; which they did effectually, excepting the two Sanctuaries of <HI>Lhanpadarn</HI> and <HI>Lhandewi Brefi;</HI> out of which however they took se∣veral Persons who had escaped thither, and carried them away Prisoners to their several Countries. But <HI>Owen,</HI> with them who were accessary to the burning of <HI>Rydcors</HI> Castle, being fled into <HI>Ireland,</HI> desired the Umbrage and Protection of King <HI>Murcart;</HI> who re∣ceived him very gladly, upon the account of their for∣mer acquaintance; for <HI>Owen,</HI> during the War be∣twixt the Earls of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Chester,</HI> and the <HI>Welch,</HI> had fled to King <HI>Murcart,</HI> and brought him very rich Presents from <HI>Wales. Cadwgan</HI> all this while lay pri∣vately in <HI>Powys;</HI> but thinking it impossible to conti∣nue there long undiscovered, he adjudged it his wiser way to send to King <HI>Henry,</HI> and to declare his Inno∣cency and Abhorrence of that Fact which his Son had
<PB N="132" REF="103"/> committed. The King was easily persuaded that the old Man was guiltless, and wholly ignorant of his Son's Crime; and therefore he gave him permission to remain in the Country, and to enjoy the Town and Lands he received by his Wife, who was the Daughter of a <HI>Norman</HI> Lord, called <HI>Pygot de Say.</HI> But his Lands in <HI>Powys</HI> were otherwise distributed; for his Nephews <HI>Madoc</HI> and <HI>Ithel,</HI> finding what Cir∣cumstances their Uncle <HI>Cadwgan</HI> lay under, upon the account of his Son <HI>Owen;</HI> they divided betwixt them∣selves such Lands as he and his Son possessed in <HI>Powys,</HI> though afterwards they could never agree about the equal distribution of it. To counter-ballance this, <HI>Cadwgan</HI> made such Friends to the King of <HI>England,</HI> that upon paying the Fine of 100 <HI>l.</HI> he had a grant of all his Lands in <HI>Cardigan,</HI> and a power to recall all the Inhabitants, who had rubb'd off upon the publication of the King's late Order, That no <HI>Welch∣man</HI> or <HI>Norman</HI> should dwell in <HI>Cardigan.</HI> Upon in∣formation of this grant to <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> several of them that retired to <HI>Ireland</HI> returned again privately to <HI>Wales,</HI> and lurkingly remained with their Friends; but <HI>Owen</HI> durst not appear in <HI>Cardigan,</HI> by reason that his Father had received that Country from King <HI>Hen∣ry,</HI> upon condition that he would never entertain or receive his Son, nor by any means succour him either with Men or Money. Nevertheless, <HI>Owen</HI> came to <HI>Powys,</HI> and would fain be reconciled to the King, and make an Attonement for his late Misdemeanour; but he could find no body that would venture to speak in his behalf, nor make the King acquainted with his desire and willingness, to submit. And thus being hopeless and full of Despair, he could not possibly di∣vine which way to turn himself; till at last, a very unexpected opportunity offered him means and occa∣sion to oppose the <HI>English.</HI> The matter was this, there happened a Difference betwixt <HI>Madoc ap R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ryd</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> Lieutenant of the Marches of <HI>Wales,</HI> about certain <HI>English</HI> Felons, who being under the Protection of <HI>Madoc,</HI> he would not re∣store at the Bishop's request. The Bishop being much
<PB N="133" REF="103"/> offended at <HI>Madawc</HI>'s denyal, threatned him very se∣verely; and therefore to make all possible Preparations against an ensuing storm, <HI>Madawc</HI> sent to <HI>Owen,</HI> who heretofore was his greatest Enemy, desiring his help against the Bishop; and by this means being reconci∣led, they took their mutual Oaths not to betray each other, and that neither should make a separate Agree∣ment with the <HI>English,</HI> without the Knowledg and Approbation of the other. And so uniting their Power, they spoiled and ravaged all the Country about them, destroying whatever they could meet with which belonged to those they had no kindness or affection for, without the least distinction of <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Welch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Iorwerth ap Blethyn</HI> had been very unjustly detain'd <MILESTONE N="1107" UNIT="A.D."/> in Prison all this time; and now King <HI>Henry</HI> calling to mind what Hardship he laboured under, and that he committed him to custody upon no pretence of Reason, sent to know of him, what he was willing to pay for his Liberty. <HI>Iorwerth</HI> being now almost ready to sink under a fatigue of so long Imprison∣ment, was glad to give any thing he was able, to ob∣tain that which he had so long in vain hoped for; and therefore he promised either 300 <HI>l. in specie,</HI> or to the value of it in Cattel and Horses; for the pay∣ment of which, <HI>Iorwerth</HI> and <HI>Ithel</HI> the Sons of his Brother <HI>Ryryd</HI> were deliver'd for Pledges. Then the King released him out of Prison, and restored him all his Lands which were taken from him; and of the due for his Liberty, the King bestowed 10 <HI>l.</HI> upon <HI>Henry, Cadwgan</HI>'s Son by the Daughter of <HI>Pygot de Say</HI> the <HI>Norman. Owen</HI> and <HI>Madawc</HI> all this while committed all the wast and destruction possible, and cruelly annoyed both the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Normans;</HI> and always withdrew and retired to <HI>Iorwerth</HI>'s Estate, which so troubled him, by reason of the King's strict Orders, not to permit <HI>Owen</HI> to come to his or <HI>Ca∣dwgan</HI>'s Territories, that at length he sent to them this positive and peremptory Rebuke; <Q REND="margQuotes">Since it hath pleas∣ed God to place us in the midst of our Enemies, and to deliver us into their hands; and hath so far weakened us, as that we are not able to do any thing

Being chased out hence, they made In-roads into <HI>Ʋchtryd</HI>'s Country in <HI>Merionythshire;</HI> but <HI>Ʋchtryd</HI>'s Sons, being then in <HI>Cyveilioc,</HI> hearing of it, they sent to the People of the Country, with positive Orders to oppose and resist any offer they would make to enter the Countrey. The People, tho wanting a skilful Commander, were resolv'd to do as much as lay in their power; and so meeting with them by the way, they set upon them so furiously, that <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Ma∣dawc,</HI> tho after a brave Defence, were forced to bear back, and to take the heels; <HI>Owen</HI> to <HI>Cardigan</HI> to his Father <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> and <HI>Madawc</HI> to <HI>Powys.</HI> Yet all this Misfortune could not suppress the restless Spirit of <HI>Owen;</HI> for as soon as he could rally together his scat∣ter'd Troops, he made divers In-roads into <HI>Dyfed,</HI> and carrying away several Persons to the Ships, that they came in from <HI>Ireland;</HI> he first ransom'd them, and then listing them under his own Command, made such addition to his Army, that he ventur'd to set upon a Town in <HI>Dyfed</HI> belonging to the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and having rased it to the ground, he returned to <HI>Cardi∣gan;</HI> having no regard to what Inconveniency might befall his Father from the King of <HI>England,</HI> upon this account; which a little afterwards unhappily fell out. For it happen'd that some of <HI>Owen</HI>'s Men having had intelligence, that a certain Bishop called <HI>William de
<PB N="135" REF="104"/> Brabant,</HI> was upon his Journey through that Country to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> laid wait for his coming; who without any apprehension of Treachery, passing through the Country, was unexpectedly slain, he and all his Retinue. <HI>Iorwerth</HI> and <HI>Cadwgan</HI> were then at Court, to speak with King <HI>Henry,</HI> concerning certain Business of their own; but whilst they discoursed the King, in comes a <HI>Fleming,</HI> that was a Brother to the deceased Bishop, and with a very loud Exclamation, complained how that <HI>Owen, Cadwgan</HI>'s Son, had slain his Brother and the rest of his Company; and that he was succour'd and entertained in <HI>Cadwgan</HI>'s Country. King <HI>Henry</HI> hearing this, was wrathfully displeased at such cruel Barbarity, that a Person of that Quality and Profession should be so treacherously murther'd; and therefore he asked <HI>Cadwgan</HI> what he could say to the matter; who answered, that what had so unhap∣pily fell out, was done without the least of his know∣ledg or approbation, and therefore desired his Majesty to impute all the Blame and Guilt of that unfortunate Action to his Son <HI>Owen.</HI> But King <HI>Henry</HI> was so far from being satisfied with this Reply, that he told <HI>Ca∣dwgan</HI> in a violent passion, That since he could not keep his Son so, but that he was aided and continual∣ly entertained in his Country, he would bestow it up∣on another Person, who was better able and more willing to keep him out; and would allow him a Maintenance upon his own proper Charges, upon these Conditions, That he should not enter into <HI>Wales</HI> any more, without his farther Orders; and so grant∣ing him Twenty Days for the ordering his Affairs, he gave him liberty to retire to any part of his Domini∣ons, excepting <HI>Wales.</HI> When <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Madawc</HI> were informed how <HI>Cadwgan</HI> was treated by the King of <HI>England,</HI> and that <HI>Cardigan,</HI> which was their chiefest place of refuge, was to be given to another Person, they thought that their Condition by this time was de∣sperate, and that they had not better stay any longer in <HI>Britain;</HI> and therefore with all speed they took shipping for <HI>Ireland,</HI> where they were sure to be ho∣nourably entertained by King <HI>Murkart.</HI> Then King
<PB N="136" REF="105"/> <HI>Henry</HI> sent for <HI>Gilbert Strongbow,</HI> Earl of <HI>Strygill,</HI> a Per∣son of noted Worth and Valour, and one who had often sued to the King for to grant him some Lands in <HI>Wales,</HI> and bestowed upon him all the Lands and Inheritance of <HI>Cadwgan ap Blethyn,</HI> in case he could conquer and bring the Country under. <HI>Gil∣bert</HI> very thankfully accepted of the Proposal, and ha∣ving drawn together all the Forces he was able to raise, he passed to <HI>Wales,</HI> and being come to <HI>Cardigan,</HI> without the least Trouble or Opposition, he reduced the whole Country to his Subjection. The first thing he did, was the best he could to secure himself in this new-purchased Inheritance; in order to which, he erected two Castles, one upon the Frontiers of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> upon the Mouth of the River <HI>Ystwyth,</HI> a Mile distant from <HI>Lhanbadarn;</HI> the other towards <HI>Dyfed,</HI> upon the River <HI>Teifi,</HI> at a place called <HI>Dyngerant;</HI> where, as some think, <HI>Roger Montgomery</HI> had some∣time before laid the Foundation of <HI>Cilgarran</HI> Castle. <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Madawc</HI> were all this while in <HI>Ireland;</HI> but this latter being at length tired with the Country, and not willing to endure the Manners and Customs of the <HI>Irish,</HI> came over for <HI>Wales,</HI> and passed to the Coun∣try of his Uncle <HI>Iorwerth. Iorwerth</HI> being acquainted with his arrival, was fearful to suffer the same Fate with his Brother <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> by winking at his being there; and therefore without any regard to Relation or Consanguinity, he presently issued out a Proclama∣tion, forbidding any of his Subjects under a great Pe∣nalty to receive him, but that they should account him an open Enemy to their Country, and endeavour all they could to secure him, and to bring him Priso∣ner before him. When <HI>Madawc</HI> understood this, how that his Person was in continual danger whil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he re∣mained there; having drawn to him all the Out-laws and Villains in the Country, he kept in the Rocks and Mountains, devising all the ways and means he could to be revenged upon <HI>Iorwerth;</HI> and so made a private League and Agreement with <HI>Lhywarch ap Trahaern.</HI> who for a long time had been a mortal Enemy of <HI>Ior∣werths.</HI> These two Associates, having intelligence
<PB N="137" REF="105"/> that <HI>Iorwerth</HI> lay one night at <HI>Caereineon,</HI> gathered all their strength, and came and encompassed the House at Midnight; which when <HI>Iorwerth</HI>'s Servants perceived, they arose and defended the House with all the Might they could; but the Assailants at last putting the House on fire, they were glad, as many as could, to escape through the Flames; the greatest part being forced to yield, either to the Enemies Sword, or the more conquering Fire. <HI>Iorwerth</HI> seeing no remedy, but that he must undergo the same Fate as his Men had done, chose rather to dye in the presence of his Enemies, with his Sword in his Hand, than to com∣mit his Life to the cowardly Flames; and therefore rushing out with great Violence, he was received up∣on the points of the Enemies Spears, and so being tos∣sed into the Fire, he miserably perished by a double death. As soon as King <HI>Henry</HI> heard of his Death, he sent for <HI>Cadwgan</HI> to him, and gave him all his Bro∣ther's Estate, being <HI>Powys-land;</HI> and promising his Son <HI>Owen</HI> his Pardon, upon condition he would de∣mean himself quietly and loyally hereafter, willed him to send for him back from <HI>Ireland.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> also about this time, married his natural Son <HI>Robert</HI> to <HI>Mabil</HI> Daughter and sole Heir to <HI>Robert Fiz-hamon</HI> Lord of <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> in whose Right this <HI>Robert</HI> became Lord of <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> being before by the King created E. of <HI>Glocester;</HI> by whom the Castle of <HI>Cardaf</HI> was built.</P>
<P>But <HI>Madawc</HI> finding the matter nothing mended, and that his other Uncle <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> who lay under the same Obligation to the King of <HI>England,</HI> ruled the Country, hid himself in the most private and in∣accessible places, watching only an opportunity to commit the like Fact upon <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> and to murder him by one treacherous way or another. And this he effected in a little time; for <HI>Cadwgan</HI> having reduced the Country to some sort of Settlement and Quietness, and restored the Courts of Judicature, where he sate in person to administer Justice; came with the rest of the Elders of the Country to <HI>Trallwng,</HI> now <HI>Pool;</HI> and having begun to build a Castle, he thought to make that the constant Seat of his Habitation. <HI>Madawc</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="106"/> understanding his Design, laid in ambush for him in his way to <HI>Trallwng;</HI> and as <HI>Cadwgan</HI> unconcernedly passed by, without the least suscicion of Treachery, he suddenly set upon him, and slew him, without al∣lowing him any time either to fight or escape. Then he sent presently a message to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> the King's Lieutenant in the Marches, to put him in mind of his former Promises to him, when he chased <HI>Owen</HI> out of the Country; because that the Bishop bearing an inveterate Enmity to <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> and his Son <HI>Owen,</HI> granted <HI>Madawc</HI> such Lands, as his Brother <HI>Ithel</HI> was possessed of. But <HI>Meredith ap Ble∣thyn,</HI> being informed of the death of both his Brothers, went in all hast to the King, desiring of him the Lands of <HI>Iorwerth</HI> in <HI>Powys,</HI> which he had lately granted to <HI>Cadwgan;</HI> which the King granted him, till such time as <HI>Owen</HI> should return from <HI>Ireland. Owen</HI> did not stay long before he came over; and then going to King <HI>Henry,</HI> he was honourably received, and had all his Fathers Estate restored to him; whereupon, in gratitude of this signal Favour, he voluntarily promis∣ed to pay the King a considerable Fine, for the due payment of which, he gave very responsible Pledges. <HI>Madawc</HI> finding himself alone to be left in the lurch, and that he had no seeming Power to bear Head against the King, thought it also his wisest way to make what Reconciliation he could; and therefore he offered the King a very great Fine, if he should peaceably enjoy his former Estate, promising withal, never to molest or disturb any one that was subject to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> willing to bring all matters to a settled condition, readily granted his Request, and conferred upon him all he could reasonably ask for; only with this Proviso, that upon his peril he should provide for the Relations of them whom he had so basely murthered.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1109" UNIT="A.D."/> And thus all matters being brought to a peaceable conclusion in <HI>Wales;</HI> the next Year, <HI>Robert de Belesmo,</HI> who had been one of the chief Instruments of these <HI>Welch</HI> Disturbances, in that great Rebellion, which himself, with <HI>Roger de Montgomery,</HI> Earl of <HI>Salop,</HI> and
<PB N="139" REF="106"/> his Brother <HI>Arnulph</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> had raised against the King; was taken Prisoner by King <HI>Henry</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and committed to perpetual Imprison∣ment in <HI>Warham</HI>-Castle. The Year following, <HI>Mere∣dith <MILESTONE N="1110" UNIT="A.D."/> ap Blethyn</HI> detached a considerable Party of his Men, to make Incursions into the Country of <HI>Lhywarch ap Trahaern ap Gwyn,</HI> who was an inveterate Enemy of himself and <HI>Owen;</HI> by reason that by his Aid and Instigation, <HI>Madawc</HI> was encouraged to kill his Un∣cles <HI>Iorwerth</HI> and <HI>Cadwgan.</HI> These Men as they passed through <HI>Madawc</HI>'s Country, met a Person in the night∣time who belonged to <HI>Madawc;</HI> who being asked where his Master was, after some pretence of igno∣rance, at last through fear confessed, that he was not far from that place. Therefore lying quietly there all Night, by break of day they arose to look out their Game; and unexpectedly surpizing <HI>Madawc,</HI> they flew a great number of his Men, and took himself Prisoner; and so carrying him to their Lord, they deliver'd him up, as the greatest Honour of their Ex∣pedition. <HI>Meredith</HI> was not a little proud of his Pri∣soner, and therefore to ingratiate himself the more with his Nephew <HI>Owen,</HI> he committed him to safe Custody, till he was sent for; who coming thither streight, <HI>Meredith</HI> delivered <HI>Madawc</HI> up to him. <HI>Owen,</HI> though he had the greatest reason for the most cruel Revenge, by reason that both his Father and Uncle were basely murthered by this <HI>Madawc,</HI> would not put him to death, remembring the intimate Friendship and Oaths that had passed betwixt them; but howe∣ver, to secure him from any future Mischief he might practise, he pulled out his Eyes, and then set him at liberty. But least he should be capable of any Re∣venge, by reason of his Estate and Strength in the Country, <HI>Meredith</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> thought fit to divide his Lands betwixt them; which were, <HI>Caernarvon, Aber∣hiw,</HI> with the third part of <HI>Deuthwfyr.</HI></P>
<P>These home-bread Disturbances being pretty well abated, a greater storm arose from abroad; for the <MILESTONE N="1111" UNIT="A.D."/> next Year, King <HI>Henry</HI> prepared a mighty Army to en∣ter into <HI>Wales,</HI> being provoked thereto by the request
<PB N="140" REF="107"/> of those who enjoyed a great part of the Welchmens Lands, but would not be satisfied till they got all. For <HI>Gilbert Strongbow</HI> Earl of <HI>Strygill,</HI> upon whom the King had bestowed <HI>Cardigan,</HI> made great Com∣plaints of <HI>Owen ap Cadwgan,</HI> declaring how that he received and entertained such Persons as spoiled and robbed in his Country; and <HI>Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> made the like of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> how that his Subjects and the Men of <HI>Grono ap Owen ap Edwyn</HI> Lord of <HI>Tegengl,</HI> unreproved, wasted, and burnt the Country of <HI>Cheshire;</HI> and to aggravate the mat∣ter the more, he added farther, that <HI>Gruffydh</HI> neither owed any Service, nor paid any Tribute to the King. Upon these Complaints, King <HI>Henry</HI> was so cruelly en∣raged, that he swore he would not leave one living Creature remaining in <HI>North-Wales</HI> and <HI>Powys-land;</HI> but having extirpated utterly the present Race of Peo∣ple, he would plant a Colony of new Inhabitants. And then dividing his Army into three parts, he deliver'd one to the conduct of the Earl of <HI>Strygill,</HI> to go against <HI>South-Wales,</HI> which comprehended the whole Power of the fourth part of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Cornwal:</HI> The next Battel was designed against <HI>North-Wales,</HI> in which was all the strength of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the North, and was commanded by <HI>Alexander</HI> King of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester:</HI> the Third the King led him∣self against <HI>Powys,</HI> wherein was contained the whole strength of the middle part of <HI>England. Meredith ap Blethyn</HI> hearing of these mighty Preparations, and be∣ing informed that this vast Army was design'd against <HI>Wales,</HI> was quickly apprehensive that the <HI>Welch</HI> were not able to make any great Defence; and therefore thought it his safest way to provide for himself before∣hand; and so coming to the King, yielded himself up to his Mercy. But <HI>Owen</HI> fearing to commit himself to those whom he knew so greedily to covet his Estate, and whom he was assured were far more desirous to dispossess the <HI>Welch</HI> of their Lands, than any other way to punish them for former Crimes and Miscar∣riages, fled to <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> to <HI>North-Wales.</HI> Up∣on that, King <HI>Henry</HI> converted his whole Force that
<PB N="141" REF="107"/> way, and came himself as far as <HI>Murcastelh,</HI> and the <HI>Scotch</HI> King to <HI>Pennant Bachwy;</HI> but the People flying to the Mountains, carried with them all the Cattel and Provision they had; so that the <HI>English</HI> could not follow them, and as many as attempted to come at them, were either slain or wounded in the streights. But <HI>Alexander</HI> King of the <HI>Scots</HI> finding that nothing could possibly be effected against the <HI>Welch,</HI> as long as they kept the Rocks and Mountains, sent to Prince <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> advising him to submit himself to the King, promising him all his Interest to obtain an honourable Peace. But the Prince was too well acquainted with <HI>English</HI> Promises, and therefore refused his Proposals; and so King <HI>Henry</HI> being very unwilling to return with∣out doing something in this Expedition, sent to <HI>Owen</HI> to forsake the Prince, who was not able to defend himself, but was ready to strike a Peace with the <HI>Scot∣tish</HI> King and the Earl of <HI>Chester.</HI> But this cunning In∣sinuation would not take effect; for <HI>Owen</HI> was for his life as distrustful of King <HI>Henry</HI> as Prince <HI>Gruffydh;</HI> and therefore he would hearken to no Intreaties for re∣volting from him, who had all this while afforded him Refuge, till at length his Uncle <HI>Meredith,</HI> an old in∣sinuating Politician, persuaded him, with much a do, not to forsake the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Proposals, who offered him all his Lands without Tribute, in case he would come to his side; and therefore <HI>Meredith</HI> ad∣vised him instantly to accept of his offer, before Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> made a Peace with the King, which if it was once done, he would be glad upon any score to purchase the King's Mercy. <HI>Owen</HI> being prevailed up∣on by such Arguments, came to the King, who re∣ceived him very gratiously, and told him, that because he believed his Promise, he would not only perform that, but likewise exalt him above any of his Kindred, and grant him his Lands free from any payment of Tribute. Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> perceiving how that <HI>Owen</HI> had submitted to the King, thought it also his wisest way to sue for Peace; and so promising the King a great Sum of Money, a Peace was then actually agreed upon, and confirmed; which the King of
<PB N="142" REF="108"/> <HI>England</HI> was the more ready to consent to, because he found it impossible to do him any hurt, whilst he con∣tinued encamped in that place. Some affirm, that the submission as well of Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> as <HI>Owen,</HI> was pro∣cured by the Policy of <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Chester;</HI> this last working with <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> and assuring him that <HI>Owen</HI> had made his Peace with the King before any such thing was in agitation, so that the Prince yielding somewhat to the Earl's Request, if <HI>Owen</HI> had gone contrary to his Oath, which they had mutually taken, not to make any Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> without one anothers Knowledge, seemed to incline to a Peace. On the other hand, <HI>Meredith</HI> going in Person to his Nephew <HI>Owen,</HI> affirmed for Truth, that the Prince and the Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> were actually agreed, and that the Prince was on his Jour∣ney to the King to make his Submission. And in the mean while <HI>Meredith</HI> took especial care that all Messengers betwixt the Prince and <HI>Owen</HI> should be intercepted, and by that means <HI>Owen</HI> wilfully sub∣mitted himself to the King.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> having thus finished and brought to an end all his Business in <HI>Wales,</HI> calling <HI>Owen</HI> to him, told him, that in case he would go over with him to <HI>Normandy,</HI> and there be faithful to him, he would upon his return confirm all his Promises upon him; and so <HI>Owen</HI> accepting of the King's Offer, went with him to <HI>Normandy,</HI> where he behaved himself so gal∣lantly, that he was made a Knight; and after his re∣turn <MILESTONE N="1112" UNIT="A.D."/> the Year following, he had all his Lands and E∣state confirmed unto him. About the same time <HI>Griffri</HI> Bishop of St. <HI>Davids</HI> died, and King <HI>Henry</HI> ap∣pointed to succeed him one <HI>Barnard</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> much against the Good-will and Inclination of the <HI>Welch,</HI> who before this time were ever used to Elect their own Bishop. And this Year the rumour of <HI>Gruffydh</HI> Son to <HI>Rhys ap Theodore</HI> was spread throughout <HI>South-Wales,</HI> who, as the report went, for fear of the King had been from a Child brought up in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and having come over about two Years afore, past his time privately among his Relations, particularly
<PB N="143" REF="108"/> with <HI>Gerald</HI> Steward of <HI>Pembroke</HI> his Brother-in-Law. And now the noise of a new Prince being spread a∣broad, it came at last to the Ears of the King of <HI>England,</HI> that a certain Person appeared in <HI>Wales,</HI> who pretended to be the Son of <HI>Rhys ap Theodore</HI> late Prince of <HI>South Wales,</HI> and laid Claim to that Prin∣cipality, which was now in the King's Hands. King <HI>Henry</HI> being somewhat concerned with such a Report, and fearing lest that this new Starter should create him some greater trouble, he thought to nip him in the bud, and sent down Orders to apprehend him. But <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> being aware of the Traps laid against him, sent to <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> desiring his Assistance, and that he might have Liberty to remain safe in his Country, which <HI>Gruffydh</HI> for his Father's account, readily granted, and treated him honourably. A little after, his Brother <HI>Howel</HI> who was imprisoned by <HI>Ardulph</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> in the Castle of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> where he had remained for a great while, made his escape and fled to his Brother, then with <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> in <HI>North-Wales.</HI> But King <HI>Henry</HI> being informed that <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> and his Brother <HI>Howel</HI> were enter∣tained by the Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> sent very smooth Letters to <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan,</HI> desiring to speak with him, who being come, he received him with all the Tokens of Honor and Friendship, and bestowed upon him very rich Presents, just after the <HI>Norman</HI> Policy, who usually make very much of those whom they design afterwards to be serviceable to them. After some time's general Discourse, King <HI>Henry</HI> came at length to the main Point, and promised the Prince even Mountains of Gold, in case he would send <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> or his Head to him, which the Prince overcome by such fair Words and large Promises, promised to perform, and so returned joyfully home, big with the expectation of his future Reward. But some who wished better to <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> and his Brother <HI>Howel,</HI> presently suspected the occasion of the King's Message, and therefore they advised them to withdraw themselves privately for some time, till
<PB N="144" REF="109"/> Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI>'s mind be better understood, and whether he had made any agreement with the King of <HI>England</HI> to betray them to him. As soon as the Prince was returned to his Palace at <HI>Aberffraw,</HI> he presently enquired for <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> and learning in a little time where he was, he sent a Troop of Horse to re-call him to his Court; but <HI>Gruffydh</HI> hear∣ing of their approach, with all speed made his escape to the Church of <HI>Aberdaron,</HI> and took Sanctuary there. But Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> was so resolute to make his Promise good to the King of <HI>England,</HI> that with∣out any respect to the Religious place he had esca∣ped too, commanded the same Messengers to return, and to bring him away by Force, which the Clergy of the Country unanimously withstood, protesting that they would not see the Liberties of the Church in the least infringed. And whilst the Clergy and the Prince's Officers were thus at debate, that same night, some who had Compassion upon the young Prince, and seeing how greedily his Life was thirsted for, conveyed him away out of <HI>North-Wales</HI> to <HI>Straywy</HI> in <HI>South-Wales.</HI> And so being delivered from the treacherous and more dishonourable Practices of the Prince of <HI>North Wales,</HI> he was forced for the De∣fence of his own Life, to bid open Defiance to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and thereupon having raised all the Forces which the shortness of the opportunity would permit, he made War upon the <HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Nor∣mans.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1113" UNIT="A.D."/> The next year, he laid Siege to the Castle which stood over-against <HI>Arberth,</HI> and winning the same, made it plain with the Ground, and from thence marched to <HI>Lhanymdhyfry</HI> Castle, belonging to <HI>Ri∣chard de Pwns,</HI> upon whom the King had bestowed <HI>Cantref Bychan,</HI> but the Garrison commanded by <HI>Meredith ap Rytherch ap Caradoc,</HI> so manfully de∣fended it, that <HI>Gruffydh</HI> after killing only some few of the Besieged, and burning the Out-works, was forced to remove with no small Loss of his own Men. Finding this place impregnable, he came before <HI>Abertawy</HI>-Castle, which was built by <HI>Henry Beaumont</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="109"/> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> but this proving too strong to be quickly surrendered, after he had burnt some of the outward Buildings, he returned to <HI>Stratywy,</HI> burning and destroying all the Country as he went along. And now his Fame being spread abroad thro' all the Country, all the wild and head-strong Youth, and they whose Fortunes were desperate, resorted unto him from all Parts, by which means being waxed Strong and Numerous, he made in Roads into <HI>Ros</HI> and <HI>Dyfed,</HI> spoiling and destroying the Coun∣try before him. The <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Flemings</HI> were cruelly enraged with these continual Depredations, and how to remedy this Mischief, was not easily de∣termined; but after long Consultation, they thought it the best way to call together such <HI>Welch</HI> Lords as were Friends to the King of <HI>England,</HI> such were <HI>Owen ap Rhytherch,</HI> and <HI>Rhytherch ap Theodore,</HI> with his Sons <HI>Meredith</HI> and <HI>Owen,</HI> whose Mother was <HI>Heynyth</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Blethyn ap Confyn,</HI> and <HI>Owen ap Caradoc</HI> the Son of <HI>Gwenlhian</HI> another Daughter of <HI>Blethyn,</HI> and <HI>Meredith ap Rhytherch.</HI> These protesting their Loyalty and Fidelity to King <HI>Henry</HI> were desired to defend the King's Castle of <HI>Carmardhyn,</HI> and that by turns; <HI>Owen ap Caradoc</HI> the first Fortnight, and then by succession by <HI>Rhytherch ap Theodore</HI> and <HI>Mered th ap Rhytherch. Owen</HI> undertook the Defence of <HI>Car∣mardhyn</HI> Castle for the time required of him, and <HI>Blethyn ap Gadifor</HI> had committed to him the Go∣vernment of <HI>Abercomyn,</HI> or <HI>Abercorran</HI>-Castle, which appertained to <HI>Robert Courtmain.</HI> But for all these Preparations, <HI>Gruffydh ap R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys</HI> had a wishful Eye upon <HI>Carmardhyn</HI> and therefore he sent out some Spies to learn the Strength and Condition of the Town, who bringing him a very kind and hopeful Account, he decamped by Night, and rushing sudden∣ly into the Town, ordered his Men to make a great shout, thereby to strike a great Terror into those within. <HI>Owen ap Caradoc</HI> the Governour, being sur∣prized with such an unexpected uproar, made all possible haste to the place where he had heard the shouting, and thinking that his Men were at his
<PB N="146" REF="110"/> Heels, fell in among the Enemy; but having none to support him, his Men being all fled, he was after a manful Defence cut in pieces, and so the Town be∣ing taken, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> burnt every thing to the ground, excepting the Castle, which was also sore defaced. And then returning with a great deal of Spoil and Booty to his usual residence at <HI>Stratywy;</HI> his Forces were considerably increased by the accession of many stout young Men, who came to him from all Quar∣ters, and thought that Fortune so prospered his Arms, that no body was able to stand before him. After this he marched to <HI>Gwyr,</HI> but <HI>William de Londres</HI> thinking it impossible to stand before him, forsook the Castle with all his Men in all haste, so that when <HI>Gruffydh</HI> was come thither, he found a great deal of Cattel and Spoil, and none to own them, and there∣fore having burnt down the Castle, he carried away every thing of Value in the Country. When the <HI>Cardigan-shire</HI> Men heard how fortunately he suc∣ceeded in all his Attempts, and being extreamly fearful, lest his next Expedition should be against them, sent to him, desiring him, as being their near Relation and Country man, to take upon him the Rule and Government over them. <HI>Gruffydh</HI> willing∣ly accepted of their Offer, and coming thither, was joyfully received by the Chief Men in the Country, who were <HI>Cadifor ap Grono, Howel ap Dinerth,</HI> and <HI>Trahaern ap Ithel,</HI> which three Persons had forsaken <HI>Dyfed,</HI> by reason that it was so thwacked with <HI>Nor∣mans, Flemings</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Men. Nor was <HI>Cardigan</HI> free from Strangers, who pretended to sway and rule the Country, but the People bearing in mind the continual Wrong and Oppression they received from them, bore an inveterate hatred to them, and were very glad to be delivered from their insolent and imperious Oppressours. For King <HI>Henry</HI> what by Force and Banishment of those that stood up stiff for their Liberty, and what by corrupting of those that were wavering, had brought all that Country to his subjection, and bestowed what Lands he thought fit upon his <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Norman</HI> Favourites. But not∣withstanding
<PB N="147" REF="110"/> the Strength of the <HI>English</HI> in this Coun∣try, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> was not a whit cast down, but boldly coming on to <HI>Cardigan Iscoed,</HI> he laid Siege to a Fort that Earl <HI>Gilbert</HI> and the <HI>Flemings</HI> had built at a place called <HI>Blaen Porth Gwythan.</HI> After divers Assaults, and the killing of several of the besieged, with the loss only of one of his Men, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> took the place, and rasing it to the ground, brought all the Country thereabouts to subjection. This Action proved very fatal to the <HI>English,</HI> for immediately upon this, they began to forsake their Houses and Habitations, as thinking it too hot for them to stay any longer in the Country, and so the <HI>Welch</HI> burnt and destroyed as far as <HI>Penwedic</HI> all the Houses of those Strangers whom Earl <HI>Gilbert</HI> had brought with him. Then <HI>Gruffydh</HI> besieged the Castle of <HI>Stradpythylh</HI> which belonged to <HI>Ralph</HI> Earl <HI>Gilbert</HI>'s Steward, and having made himself Master of it, he put all the Garrison to the Sword. Removing from thence, he incamped at <HI>Glasgryg</HI> a mile from <HI>Lhanbadarn,</HI> purposing to Besiege <HI>Aberystwith</HI>-Castle next morning, but for want of Provision necessary for his Army, he was forced to make bold with some Cattel which grazed within the Limits of the Sanctuary. And here it may be observed, that not only Men enjoyed the Privilege of these Sanctuaries, but also Cattel and Horses, and whatever else lived within the Liberties of them. But the day following, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> marched disorderly towards the Castle, being apprehensive of no great opposition, by reason that he was ignorant of the number of the Garrison, and so encamping upon an opposite Hill, which was divided from the Castle by a River, with a Bridge over it, he called a Council to determin with what Engines they might with best Success play against it, and so make a ge∣neral, Assault. The <HI>Normans</HI> observing their Dis∣order, very cunningly sent out some of their Archers to skirmish with them, and so by little and little to entice them to the Bridge, where some of the best armed Horse-men were ready to issue out upon them. The <HI>Welch</HI> not thinking the Garrison to be
<PB N="148" REF="111"/> so strong, approached near the Bridg, still skirmishing with the <HI>Normans,</HI> who pretended to give ground; but when they came very near, out sallies one on horse back, who would fain pass the Bridg; but be∣ing received upon the points of their Spears, he began to flag, and as he endeavoured to return, he fell off his Horse, and so the <HI>Welch</HI> pursued him over the Bridg. The <HI>Englishmen</HI> seeing this, fled towards the Castle, and the <HI>Welch</HI> with all speed followed them to the top of the Hill; but whilst they thought that the day was their own, up rises a Party of Horse which lay in ambuscade under the Hill, and standing be∣twixt the <HI>Welch</HI> and the Bridg, prevented any Suc∣cour to come to them. And the <HI>Welch</HI> being thus hemm'd in betwixt both Parties, the former recoil∣ing with greater strength, were so unmercifully cut off, that scarce one Man was left living. When the rest of the <HI>Welch</HI> Army, that staid on the other side of the River, saw what number the Garrison con∣tained, and that they were strong beyond their expe∣ctation, presently decamped, and with all speed de∣parted out of the Country.</P>
<P>When King <HI>Henry</HI> was informed of all the Mis∣chief and Cruelties that <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> had com∣mitted among his Subjects in <HI>Wales,</HI> he sent for <HI>Owen ap Cadwgan,</HI> desiring him and <HI>Lhywarch ap Trahaern</HI> to use all the effectual Method possible to take or kill the Arch Rebel <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> promising very speedily to send his Son <HI>Robert</HI> with an Army to <HI>Wales</HI> for that purpose. <HI>Owen</HI> being very proud that the King put such Confidence in him, encouraged his Men to be now so industrious to merit the King's Favour, as they had been formerly to deserve his Displeasure; and so joyning his Forces with <HI>Lhywarch,</HI> they both marched to meet Prince <HI>Robert</HI> at <HI>Stratywy,</HI> where they supposed <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> had hid himself in the Woods. When they were come to the Frontiers of the Country, they made a Vow, that they would let neither Man, Woman, or Child escape alive; which so affrighted the People of the Country, that all made what shift they could to save their Lives,
<PB N="149" REF="111"/> some by fleeing to the Woods and Mountains, and some by getting into the King's Castles, from whence they had come but a little before. Then <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Lhywarch</HI> separated with distinct Parties to scour the Woods, which about <HI>Stratywy</HI> are very desertous; and <HI>Owen</HI> having entred with an Hundred Men, presently discovered the tract of Men and Cattel, and follow'd their Foot-steps so close, that within a little while he overtook them; and having slain a great many of them, and put the rest to flight, he carried away all their Cattel back to his Army. But whilst <HI>Owen</HI> was busie in searching the Woods, <HI>Gerald</HI> Steward of <HI>Pembrock,</HI> who with a great Power of <HI>Flemings</HI> was upon his march to joyn the King's Son, met with them who fled from <HI>Owen;</HI> who desiring help of <HI>Gerald,</HI> de∣clared how <HI>Owen</HI> had forcibly drove them out, slain a great many of their Companions, and spoiled them of all their Goods. <HI>Gerald</HI> and his <HI>Flemings</HI> understan∣ding that <HI>Owen</HI> was so nigh with such a small number of Men, thought he had now very convenient oppor∣tunity to be revenged of him upon the account of his Wife; and therefore to make sure Work with him, he pursued him close into the Woods. <HI>Owen</HI> being fore-warned by his Men that a great number follow∣ed him, and advised to make all speed to get away, was deaf to all such Counsels, as thinking that they of whom his Men were so much afraid of, were the King's Friends, and therefore their Integrity need not be questioned, since they all had respect to the same common Cause. But he found, that a private Quar∣rel is sometime more regarded than the publick Good; and therefore when <HI>Gerald</HI> was advanced within bow∣shot, he greeted him with a Volloy of Arrows, to shew how great a Friend he was; but <HI>Owen,</HI> tho persuaded to flee, was so little terrified at such an un∣welcom Salutation, that tho' the Enemy were Seven to One, yet he told them, that they were but <HI>Flemings,</HI> and such as always trembled at the hearing of his Name. And then falling on with a great deal of Courage, he was at the first On-let struck with an Arrow into the Heart, of which Wound he presently
<PB N="150" REF="112"/> dyed; which when his Men saw, they all fled, and brought word to <HI>Lhywarch</HI> and the rest of their Fel∣lows of what had happen'd; and so suspecting the King's Army, seeing they could not be trusted in their Service, they all returned to their respective Countries. <HI>Owen</HI> being in this manner unhappily slain, his Brethren divided his Lands betwixt them; excepting <HI>Caereneon,</HI> which properly belonged to <HI>Ma∣dawc ap Ryryd ap Blethyn;</HI> and which he had forcibly taken away from his Uncle <HI>Meredith.</HI> His Father <HI>Ca∣dwgan</HI> had several Children by different Women; and besides himself, he had Issue <HI>Madawc</HI> by <HI>Gwen∣lhian</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan; Eineon</HI> by <HI>Sanna</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Dyfnwal; Morgan,</HI> by <HI>Efelhiw</HI> or <HI>Elhiw</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Cadifor ap Colhoyn</HI> Lord of <HI>Dyfed; Henry</HI> and <HI>Gruffydh</HI> were by the Daughter of the Lord <HI>Pigot</HI> his wedded Wife; <HI>Meredith</HI> by <HI>Eu∣ruron Hoedliw;</HI> and himself by <HI>Inerth</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Edwyn.</HI> But a while afterwards, <HI>Eineon ap Cadw∣gan</HI> and <HI>Gruffydh ap Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> besieged the Castle of <HI>Cymmer</HI> in <HI>Merionythshire,</HI> which was lately built by <HI>Ʋchtryd ap Edwyn;</HI> for <HI>Cadwgan</HI> had bestowed upon <HI>Ʋchtryd</HI> his Cofin-German <HI>Merionyth</HI> and <HI>Cyfeilioc,</HI> upon condition, that in all Cases he should appear his Friend, and his Sons after him; contrary to which Promise he bore no manner of re∣gard to <HI>Cadwgan</HI>'s Children after <HI>Owen</HI>'s death; but to strengthen himself the better, he erected this Castle of <HI>Cymmer,</HI> which very much displeased many of <HI>Ca∣dwgan</HI>'s Sons. And therefore <HI>Eineon</HI> and <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> to make <HI>Ʋchtryd</HI> sensible of his Error in despising of them, furiously set upon <HI>Cymmer</HI> Castle, and having slain divers of the Garrison, the rest surrender'd themselves; and so taking possession of it, they divided the Coun∣try betwixt them; <HI>Mowdhwy Cyfyeilioc</HI> and half <HI>Penlhyn</HI> to <HI>Gruffydh ap Meredith;</HI> and the other half of <HI>Pen∣thyn</HI> with all <HI>Merionyth</HI> to <HI>Eineon.</HI></P>
<P>The next Year King <HI>Henry</HI> failed with a great Ar∣my into <HI>Normandy,</HI> against the <HI>French</HI> King, who with the Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI> and others, went about to make <HI>William</HI> the Son of <HI>Robert Curthoise</HI> Duke of
<PB N="151" REF="112"/> <HI>Normandy;</HI> but at the appearance of the King of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> they all scatter'd, and laid aside their intended Design. About the same time <HI>Gilbert Strongbow</HI> Earl of <HI>Strigill,</HI> to whom King <HI>Henry</HI> had given all <HI>Cardi∣gan,</HI> departed this Life, after a long Fit of a Consum∣ption; much to the Joy and Satisfaction of the <HI>Welch,</HI> who were in great measure displeased, that they should be deprived of their own natural Lord <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> from whom this Country was taken away, and be forced to serve and be subject to a Stranger, whose Kindness they had no great reason to expect. But the Year fol∣lowing,<MILESTONE N="1115" UNIT="A.D."/> an irreconcilable Quarrel happen'd betwixt <HI>Howel ap Ithel</HI> Lord of <HI>Ros</HI> and <HI>Ryfonioc,</HI> now <HI>Den∣bigh-land,</HI> and <HI>Riryd</HI> and <HI>Lhywarch</HI> the Sons of <HI>Owen ap Edwyn.</HI> And when they could not otherwise agree, they broke out into open War; and thereupon <HI>Howel</HI> sent to <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> and to <HI>Eineon</HI> and <HI>Ma∣dawc, Cadwgan</HI>'s Sons; who came down from <HI>Merio∣nyth</HI> with a Party of Four Hundred well-disciplin'd Men, and encamped in <HI>Dyffryn Clwyd. Riryd</HI> and <HI>Lhywarch</HI> on the other hand, de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red the Assistance of their Cosins the Sons of <HI>Ʋchtryd;</HI> and so both Ar∣mies meeting in the Vale of <HI>Clwyd,</HI> they fell to Blows with a great deal of Spirit and Alacrity, and after a te∣dious and a bloody Fight, <HI>Lhywarch, Owen ap Edwyn</HI>'s Son, was at last slain, and with him <HI>Iorwerth</HI> the Son of <HI>Nudh,</HI> a noble and a valorous Person; and <HI>Riryd</HI> was forced to make his Escape by flight. But though <HI>Howel</HI> obtained the Victory, yet he did not long sur∣vive his slain Enemies; for having received a despe∣rate Wound in the Action, dyed of it within Fourty Days; and then <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> and the Sons of <HI>Cadwgan</HI> finding it dangerous to stay longer there, for fear of some <HI>French,</HI> who lay garrisoned in <HI>Chester,</HI> returned home with all speed.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> was still in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and about this <MILESTONE N="1116" UNIT="A.D."/> time, a very great Battel was fought betwixt him, and the <HI>French</HI> King, who was shamefully vanquished and overthrown, and had a great number of his Nobles taken Prisoners. But as King <HI>Henry</HI> returned the fol∣lowing <MILESTONE N="11 7." UNIT="A.D."/> Year for <HI>England,</HI> one of the Ships happened,
<PB N="152" REF="113"/> by the negligence of the Pilot, to be cast away, wherein perished the King's two Sons, <HI>William</HI> who was legitimate, and Heir apparent to the Crown, and <HI>Richard</HI> his base Son; together with his Daughter and Neece, and several others of his Nobility, to the number in all of 150 Persons. This unparallel'd Loss of so many Kindred and Friends did not perplex his Mind so long, but that within a short time, he be∣gan to solace and raise his drooping Spirits with the thoughts of a new Wife; and having married <HI>Ade∣lice</HI> <MILESTONE N="1118" UNIT="A.D."/> the Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Lovain,</HI> he purposed to go against <HI>Wales,</HI> and having prepared his Forces, he led them in person to <HI>Powys-land.</HI> When <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn</HI> and <HI>Eineon, Madawc</HI> and <HI>Morgan,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Cadwgan</HI> and Lords of the Country heard of it, they sent to <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> Prince of <HI>North Wales,</HI> de∣siring some help at his hands; who flatly refused, as∣suring them, that because he was at peace with the King of <HI>England,</HI> he could neither with Honour nor Safety send them any Succour, nor permit them to come within his Dominions. The Lords of <HI>Powys</HI> re∣ceiving this unwelcom Answer, and having now no manner of hopes of any Aid, were resolved however to defend themselves as well as they could; and there∣fore they thought it the most effectual means to annoy the Enemy, and to keep them from entering into the Country, was to observe and defend the Streights, by which the Enemy must of necessity pass. Neither were they out in their Policy; for it happened that the King himself, with a small number, advanced to one of these narrow Passages, the rest of the Army, by reason of their Carriages, having taken some compass about; which the <HI>Welch</HI> perceiving, presently poured a Shower of Arrows upon them, and the advantage of the ground giving help to their Execution, they slew and wounded a great many of the <HI>English.</HI> The King himself was struck in the Breast, but for all that the Arrow could not hurt him, by reason of his Armour; yet he was so terrified with this unexpected Conflict, and considering with himself, that he must receive se∣veral such Brushes before he could advance to the plain
<PB N="153" REF="113"/> Country; and what was above all, being sensible that by such rash Misfortune he might lose all the Honour and Fame which he had before obtained, sent a Mes∣sage to parly with them who kept the Passage, and with all assurance of Safety, to desire them to come to the King. The <HI>Welch</HI> being come, and question'd how they had such Confidence to oppose the King, and to put his Life in so much danger; made Answer, that they belonged to <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> and accor∣ding to their Master's Orders they were resolved to keep the Passage, or to dye upon the spot. The King finding them so resolute, desired them to go to <HI>Mere∣dith,</HI> and propose to him an agreement of Peace, which he and his Cosins the Sons of <HI>Cadwgan</HI> accep∣ted of; and promised to pay the King 10000 Head of Cattel, in Retribution for former Offences. And so King <HI>Henry</HI> leaving all things in a peaceable and quiet posture in <HI>Wales,</HI> and appointing the Lord <HI>Fitz-Warren</HI> Warden or Lieutenant of the Marches, re∣turned to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But when a foreign Enemy was removed out of the Country, the <HI>Welch</HI> could never forbear quarrelling <MILESTONE N="1120" UNIT="A.D."/> with each other; for <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys ap Theodore,</HI> who had been now for some time quiet, fell upon <HI>Gruffydh ap Sulhaern,</HI> and for what reason not disco∣vered, treacherously slew him. But the next Year <MILESTONE N="1121" UNIT="A.D."/> there happened another occasion of Disturbances and falling out among the <HI>Welch;</HI> for <HI>Eineon</HI> the Son of <HI>Cadwgan</HI> dying, left all his share of <HI>Powys</HI> and <HI>Merio∣nyth</HI> to his Brother <HI>Meredith.</HI> But his Uncle <HI>Mere∣dith ap Blethyn,</HI> thinking that these Lands more pro∣perly belonged to him, ejected his Nephew <HI>Meredith</HI> to whom his Brother <HI>Eineon</HI> had left them, and took possession of them himself. And what augmented these Differences, King <HI>Henry</HI> set now at liberty <HI>Ithel ap Riryd ap Blethyn, Meredith</HI>'s Nephew, who had been for a long time detained in Prison; who coming to his own Country, was in expectation to enjoy his Estate, which, upon his being put in custody, his Re∣lations had divided betwixt them; of which, the greatest share fell to his Uncle <HI>Meredith.</HI> But when
<PB N="154" REF="114"/> <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> was informed, how that <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> contrary to all Justice, had taken away by force the Lands of his Nephew <HI>Meredith ap Cadw∣gan,</HI> he sent his Sons <HI>Cadwalhon</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> with an Ar∣my into <HI>Merionyth,</HI> who conquering and bringing to subjection all the Country, carryed away the chief of the People, and all the Cattle to <HI>Lhyn.</HI> And at the same time the Sons of <HI>Cadwgan</HI> entered into the Lands of <HI>Lhywarch ap Trahaern,</HI> and cruelly wasted and de∣stroyed it, by reason that he had countenanced the Do∣ings of their Uncle <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn.</HI> But these in∣ward Clashings and Animosities concerning Estates and Titles, were seconded by most unnatural Bloodshed and unparallell'd Cruelties; for <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> when he found that his Nephew <HI>Meredith ap Cadwgan</HI> was assisted by the Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and that it <MILESTONE N="1122" UNIT="A.D."/> was impracticable to keep <HI>Merionyth</HI> from him, he was resolved to practice that upon his Nephew, which he had failed to effect upon another. And therefore lest his other Nephew <HI>Ithel ap Riryd</HI> should meet with the like Help and Encouragement to recover those Lands, which during his Imprisonment were taken away from him, of which his Uncle actually enjoyed a considerable share; <HI>Meredith</HI> thought it his wisest way to prevent all manner of Disputes, by sending <HI>Ithel</HI> out of the World, which upon mature Delibe∣ration he treacherously effected. Nor was this the only Murther committed at this time; for <HI>Cadwalhon</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> exceeded him far, and slew his three Uncles, <HI>Grono, Riryd,</HI> and <HI>Meilyr</HI> the Sons of <HI>Owen ap Edwyn;</HI> but which was most unna∣tural of all, <HI>Morgan ap Cadwgan</HI> with his own hands killed his Brother <HI>Meredith;</HI> a Crime most execrable, tho he did afterwards repent of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1124" UNIT="A.D."/> Not long after this, <HI>Gruffyth ap Rhys,</HI> by the false and invidious Accusations of the <HI>Normans,</HI> was dis∣possessed of all the Lands which King <HI>Henry</HI> had for∣merly granted him, and which he had for a considera∣ble time peaceably enjoyed. And towards the end of the same Year dyed <HI>Daniel ap Sulgien</HI> Bishop of S. <HI>Davids,</HI> and Archdeacon of <HI>Powys,</HI> a Man of ex∣traordinary
<PB N="155" REF="114"/> Piety and Learning, and one who made it his continual Employment to endeavour to work a Reconciliation betwixt <HI>North-Wales</HI> and <HI>Powys,</HI> which in his time were at perpetual Variance and Enmity with one another. The next Year dyed likewise <MILESTONE N="1125" UNIT="A.D."/> <HI>Gruffydh</HI> the Son of <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn;</HI> and about the same time <HI>Owen ap Cadwgan</HI> having got into his hands <HI>Meredith ap Lhywarch,</HI> delivered him to <HI>Pain Fitz-John,</HI> to be kept safe Prisoner in the Castle of <HI>Bridg∣north.</HI> The reason of this was, because <HI>Meredith</HI> had slain <HI>Meyric</HI> his Cosin-German, and very barbarously had pulled out the Eyes of two more of his Cosins, the Sons of <HI>Griffri.</HI> This cruel and inhuman Custom of plucking out the Eyes of such as they hated or fear∣ed, was too frequently practised in <HI>Wales;</HI> for the <MILESTONE N="1126" UNIT="A.D."/> following Year <HI>Ievaf</HI> the Son of <HI>Owen</HI> served two of his Brethren after this unnatural manner, and thinking that too little, passed a Sentence of perpetual Banish∣ment upon them. A little after, his Brother <HI>Lhewe∣lyn ap Owen</HI> slew <HI>Iorwerth ap Lhywarch;</HI> but all this Mischief practised by these two Brothers <HI>Ievaf</HI> and <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> turned at last upon themselves; for their Uncle <HI>Meredith ap Blethin</HI> being apprehensive that his two Nephews were a considerable Rub in his way, and if they trooped off, that all their Estate would of right fall to him; slew <HI>Ievaf</HI> out-right, and having pluck'd out <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>'s Eyes, castrated him, for fear he should beget any Children to inherit his Lands af∣ter him. These no doubt were implacable Times, when for the least Offence, nay sometime Suspicion, Murther was so openly and incorrigibly committed; which must of necessity be attributed to this one Prin∣ciple, That so many petty States having equal Power and Authority in their own Territories, and being subject to none but the King of <HI>England,</HI> still endea∣voured to out-vie and over-top each other. And so, nearness of Relation giving way to Ambition, they never regarded those of the same Blood, so that themselves might add to their strength, and increase their Estate by their Fall; and for this reason <HI>Meyric</HI> slew <HI>Lhywarch,</HI> and his Son <HI>Madawc</HI> his own Cosins;
<PB N="156" REF="115"/> but before he could make any Advantage of their Death, he was himself served after the same manner. But the only Person who afterwards repented of such a foul Crime, was <HI>Morgan ap Cadwgan,</HI> who being severely troubled in mind for the Murther he had lately committed upon his Brother <HI>Meredith,</HI> took a Journey to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to expiate for his Crime, and in his return from thence, dyed in the Isle of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> But this treacherous way of private murdering those by whom they were offended, could not be forgot a∣mong the <HI>Welch;</HI> for <HI>Eineon</HI> the Son of <HI>Owen ap Ed∣wyn</HI> <MILESTONE N="1129" UNIT="A.D."/> calling to mind how that <HI>Cadwalhon</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> had basely slain three of his Brothers, and taking the opportunity of his being at <HI>Nanhewdwy,</HI> assisted by <HI>Cadwgan ap Grono ap Edwyn,</HI> set upon him, and slew him. About the same time, that great U∣surper <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn ap Confyn,</HI> who by most unnatural and most hellish Practices, had got the Lands of all his Brothers and Nephews, and by that means was become a Man of the greatest strength and sway in <HI>Powys,</HI> dyed of a severe Fit of Sickness, which reduced him to that apprehension of his for∣mer Miscarriages, that he endured Penance for the expiation of former Guilts.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1134" UNIT="A.D."/> In the Year 1134. till which time nothing of mo∣ment was transacted in <HI>Wales, Henry</HI> the first of that Name, King of <HI>England,</HI> dyed in <HI>Normandy</HI> in the Month of <HI>October;</HI> after whom <HI>Stephen</HI> Earl of <HI>Bu∣loign</HI> Son to the Earl of <HI>Bloys,</HI> his Sisters Son, by the means of <HI>Hugh Bygod,</HI> was crowned King by the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> all the Nobility of <HI>England</HI> consenting thereunto; though contrary to a former Oath they had taken to <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress. The first thing that employed his Thoughts after his ac∣cession to the Government, was against <HI>David</HI> King of the <HI>Scots;</HI> who taking advantage of this new Re∣volution in <HI>England,</HI> by some treacherous means or other, got the Towns of <HI>Carlisle</HI> and <HI>Newcastle</HI> into his hands. But King <HI>Stephen,</HI> tho scarcely settled in his Throne, presently marched towards the North; of whose coming <HI>David</HI> being assured, and fearing

But having succeeded so well in this Expedition, they could not rest satisfied, till they had rid the whole Country from the intolerable Pride and Oppression of the <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Flemings;</HI> and therefore returning the same Year to <HI>Cardigan</HI> with 6000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, well disciplined and experienced Soldiers; and being joyned by <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> and <HI>Howel ap Meredith</HI> of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> with his Sons, and <HI>Madawc ap Ednerth;</HI> they over-ran the Country, as far as <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> restoring all the former Inhabitants to their proper Inheritances, and discarding all such Strangers as the late Earl of <HI>Strygil</HI> had placed in the Country. But when <HI>Stephen,</HI> who was Gover∣nour of <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> saw that, he called to him <HI>Robert Fitz-Martyn,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gerald,</HI> and <HI>William Fitz-John,</HI> with all the strength of the <HI>Normans, Flemings,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> or the Marches; and meeting with the <HI>Welch</HI> betwixt <HI>Aber Ned</HI> and <HI>Aber Dyfi,</HI> gave
<PB N="158" REF="116"/> them battel. But after a very sore and Bloody En∣counter, the <HI>English</HI> began to give ground, and ac∣cording to their usual manner, trusting too much to the strength of their Towns and Fortifications, be∣gan to look how to save themselves that way. But the <HI>Welch</HI> pressed upon 'em so hard, that they killed above 3000 Men, besides several that were drowned and taken Prisoners. This Victory being so happily obtained, <HI>Cadwalader</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> over-ran the whole Country, forcing all the <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Flemings</HI> to depart the Country with all speed, and placing in their room those miserable <HI>Welch,</HI> who had been so long deprived and kept from their own Estates; and after they had weeded the Country of those insatiable Caterpillars, they returned to <HI>North Wales,</HI> laden with very rich Spoils and acceptable Plunder. The King of <HI>England</HI> was not in a condition to take notice to what Extremities his Subjects were reduced to in <HI>Wales,</HI> by reason that his own Nobles of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> were risen in Arms against him; the reason of which Tumult among the Nobility was occasioned by a fallacious Report that went about of the King's Death, who lay then sick of a Lethargy. They that bore him no good Will, verified the Rumour as much as they could, and stirred up the common People in behalf of the Empress; whereas on the other hand the King's Friends betook themselves to Castles and strong Holds for fear of the Empress, and among o∣thers <HI>Hugh Bigod</HI> secured the Castle of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and after that he was assured that the King was well a∣gain, he was loth to deliver the same out of his pos∣session, <MILESTONE N="1136" UNIT="A.D."/> unless it were to the King's own hands. But during these Commotions and Troubles in <HI>England, Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> Son to <HI>Rhys ap Theodore,</HI> the right Heir to the Principality of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> dyed, leaving Issue behind him a Son called <HI>Rhys,</HI> commonly known by the Name of Lord <HI>Rhys,</HI> by <HI>Gwenlhian</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan,</HI> who by some is said to have poisoned her Husband. Towards the end of the same Year dyed likewise <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> after he had reigned 57 Years; to

He had Issue by <HI>Angharad</HI> the Daugh∣ter of <HI>Owen ap Edwyn,</HI> three Sons, namely, <HI>Owen, Cadwalader,</HI> and <HI>Cadwalhon,</HI> and five Daughters, <HI>Mar∣ret, Susanna, Ranulht, Agnes,</HI> and <HI>Gwenlhian:</HI> and by a Concubine <HI>Iago, Ascain, Edwal</HI> Abbot of <HI>Pen∣mon, Dolhing,</HI> and <HI>Elen,</HI> who was married to <HI>Hova ap Ithel Felyn</HI> of <HI>Yal.</HI> There were several good and wholsom Laws and Statutes enacted in his time; and among the rest, he reformed the great Disorders of the <HI>Welch</HI> Minstrels, which were then grown to great Abuse. Of these there were three sorts in <HI>Wales;</HI> the first were called <HI>Beirdh,</HI> who composed several Songs and Odes of various Measures, wherein the Poet's Skill was not only required, but also a natural Endowment, or a Vein which the Latins term <HI>furor Poeticus.</HI> These likewise kept the Records of all Gentlemens Arms and Pedegrees, and were principal∣ly esteemed among all the Degrees of the <HI>Welch</HI> Po∣ets. The next were such as plaid upon Musical In∣struments, chiefly the Harp and the Crowd; which Musick <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> first brought over into <HI>Wales;</HI> who being born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and descended by his Mothers side of <HI>Irish</HI> Parents, brought with him from thence several skilful Musicians, who invented almost all the Instruments as were afterwards plaid upon in <HI>Wales.</HI> The last sort were called <HI>Atcaneaid,</HI> whose Business it was to sing to the Instrument plaid upon by another. Each of these, by the same Statute, had their several Reward and Encouragement allotted to them; their Life and Behaviour was to be spotless and unblameable, otherwise their Punishment was ve∣ry severe and rigid, every one having Authority to pu∣nish and correct them, even to the Deprivation of all they had. They were also interdicted and forbidden to enter any Man's House, or to compose any Song of any one, without the special leave and warrant of the Party concerned; with many other Ordinances rela∣ting to the like purpose.</P>

<P>AFter the death of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan,</HI> his eldest Son <HI>Owen,</HI> surnamed <HI>Gwynedh,</HI> succeeded in the Principality of <HI>North Wales;</HI> who no sooner had entered upon the Government, but together with the rest of his Brethren, he made an Expedition in∣to <HI>South-Wales;</HI> and having demolished and over∣thrown the Castles of <HI>Stradmeyric, Stephan,</HI> and <HI>Hum∣ffreys,</HI> and laid in Ashes the Town of <HI>Caermardhyn,</HI> he returned home with no less Honor than Booty and Plunder. About the same time, <HI>John,</HI> Arch-Deacon of <HI>Lhanbaran</HI> departed this Life, a Man of singular Piety and strictness of Life, who for his ri∣gid Zeal in Religion and Virtue, was thought wor∣thy to be canonized, and to be counted among the number of the Saints. This Year likewise King <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> passed over to <HI>Normandy,</HI> and having concluded a Peace with the <HI>French</HI> King, and the Duke of <HI>An∣jou,</HI> returned back to <HI>England</HI> without any further delay. But the following Spring gave opportunity for greater Undertakings; <HI>David,</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> up∣on the King of <HI>England</HI>'s going to <HI>France</HI> last Sum∣mer, had entered the Borders of <HI>England,</HI> and con∣tinued to make considerable Wast and Havock in that part of the Country. Whereupon King <HI>Stephen,</HI> to rid his Country and his Subjects from so dange∣rous an Enemy, marched with an Army towards the <HI>North,</HI> whose coming the King of <HI>Scots</HI> hearing of, he relinquished the Borders of <HI>England,</HI> and re∣tired to his own Country. But that would not sa∣tisfie King <HI>Stephen,</HI> who desired to be further re∣venged for the unpardonable Hostilities committed by the <HI>Scots</HI> in his Country; and therefore pursuing the <HI>Scots</HI> to their own Country, he harassed and laid wast all the South part of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="117"/> But the King's absence animated several of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Nobility to rebel; to which purpose they for∣tified every one their Castles and strong Holds: <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> those of <HI>Leeds</HI> and <HI>Bristol; Ralph Lunel, Cari; William Fitz-Allen, Shrewsbury; Paganellus, Ludlow; William de Moyun, Dunester; Robert de Nichol, Warham; Eustace Fitz-John, Mer∣ton;</HI> and <HI>Walklyn, Dover.</HI> But for all these mighty Preparations, the King in a short time became Ma∣ster of them all; some he won by assault, others upon fair Promises and advantageous Conditions were surrendred up, and some he got by treacherous and under-hand Contrivances. The <HI>Scots</HI> thought to make good advantage of these Commotions in <HI>England;</HI> and thereupon, as soon as they heard that some of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility were in actual Rebellion against the King, they entered into the Borders, and began, as they thought, without any apprehension of Opposi∣tion, to ravage and lay waste the Country before 'em. But <HI>William,</HI> Earl of <HI>Albemarle; William Pyppell,</HI> Earl of <HI>Nottingham; Walter Espec</HI> and <HI>Gilbert La∣cy,</HI> gathered together all the Forces they could raise in the North; and being animated and encouraged by the eloquent and pressing Oration of <HI>Ralph,</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Orkneys,</HI> which he delivered in the audience of the whole Army, they set upon the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Al∣merton</HI> with such unanimous Courage, that after a very great slaughter of his Men, King <HI>David</HI> was glad to escape with his Life by flight. After this, King <HI>Stephen</HI> seized to his own use the Castles of <HI>Ludlow</HI> and <HI>Leeds,</HI> and pressed the Bishops of <HI>Salis∣bury</HI> and <HI>Lincoln</HI> so hard, that to prevent their pe∣rishing by Famine, they were constrained to surren∣der; the former the Castles of <HI>Vises</HI> and <HI>Shirburn;</HI> the latter those of <HI>Newark upon Trent</HI> and <HI>Sleeford.</HI> This did not a little augment the King's strength against the ensuing Storm; for in the Summer this Year, <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress, Daughter and Heir to King <HI>Henry,</HI> to whom King <HI>Stephen,</HI> with all the Nobility of <HI>England,</HI> had sworn Allegiance, landed at <HI>Arundel,</HI> with her Brother <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="118"/> and was there honourably received by <HI>William de Albineto,</HI> who was lately married to Queen <HI>Adeliz,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Widow, with whom he received the Earldom of <HI>Arundel</HI> in Dowry. But as soon as King <HI>Stephen</HI> heard of her landing, he marched with all possible speed to <HI>Arundel,</HI> and laid siege to the Castle; but finding it upon tryal impregnable, he raised the siege, and by that means suffered the Empress and her Brother to escape to <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1138" UNIT="A.D."/> The next Year an unlucky Accident fell out in <HI>Wales; Cynric,</HI> one of Prince <HI>Owen</HI>'s Sons, having by some means or other disgusted <HI>Madawc ap Mere∣dith ap Blethyn ap Confyn,</HI> a Person of considerable Esteem and Estate in the Country, was, with his con∣nivance set upon and slain by his Men. But the Af∣fairs of <HI>England</HI> this Year, afforded greater rarity of action; King <HI>Stephen</HI> with a formidable Army laid siege to the City of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> to the relief of which, <HI>Ranulph,</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> and <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> marched with their Forces. But before they could arrive, the Town was taken; whereupon they drew up their Forces in order to give the King battel, who on the other side, was as ready to receive them. King <HI>Stephen</HI> drew up his Forces in three Battels, the first being led by the Earls of <HI>Britain, Mellent, Nor∣folk, Hampton,</HI> and <HI>Warren;</HI> the second by the Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Ypres;</HI> and the third by the King himself, assisted by <HI>Baldwyn Fitz-Gilbert,</HI> with several others of his Nobility. Of the Ene∣mies side, the disinherited Barons had the first place; the Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> with a considerable Party of <HI>Welchmen,</HI> far better couraged than armed, led the second; and the Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> the third Battel. After a hot and bloody Dispute of both sides, the Victory at length favoured the Barons, King <HI>Stephen</HI> being first taken Prisoner, and a little after the Queen, together with <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Ypres,</HI> and <HI>Bryan Fitz-Count.</HI> But within a while after <HI>William Martell</HI> and <HI>Geffrey de Mandeville</HI> gathered together some fresh Forces, and fought the Empress and her Brother at <HI>Winche∣ster,</HI> and having put the Empress to flight, took Earl
<PB N="163" REF="118"/> <HI>Robert</HI> Prisoner, for exchange of whom, the King was set at liberty. The next Year King <HI>Stephen</HI> would <MILESTONE N="1139" UNIT="A.D."/> try the other Adventure, and received a second Over∣throw at <HI>Wilton;</HI> which however did not so much discourage him, but that he laid so close a siege to the Empress at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that she was glad to make her escape to <HI>Wallingford.</HI> The same Year dyed <HI>Ma∣dawc ap Ednerth,</HI> a Person of great Quality and Note in <HI>Wales;</HI> and <HI>Meredith ap Howel,</HI> a Man of no mean Esteem, was slain by the Sons of <HI>Blethyn ap Gwyn.</HI></P>
<P>For the two succeeding Years nothing remarkable <MILESTONE N="1140" UNIT="A.D."/> passed in <HI>Wales;</HI> excepting that this Year <HI>Howel ap Meredith ap Rhytherch</HI> of <HI>Cantref Rychan,</HI> and <HI>Rhys ap Howel</HI> were cowardly slain by the Treachery and perfidious Practices of the <HI>Flemings;</HI> and the next <MILESTONE N="1141" UNIT="A.D."/> Year <HI>Howel ap Meredith ap Blethyn</HI> was basely mur∣thered by his own Men; at which time, <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>Cadwgan</HI> the Sons of <HI>Madawc ap Ednerth,</HI> upon some unhappy Quarrel, did kill each other. But <MILESTONE N="1142" UNIT="A.D."/> shortly after this, an irreconcilable Difference fell out betwixt <HI>Anarawd</HI> Son to <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and his Father in Law <HI>Cadwalader</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan,</HI> and Brother to Prince <HI>Owen Gwynedh;</HI> which from Words quickly pro∣ceeded to Blows. In this Scuffle <HI>Anarawd</HI> was un∣happily slain; which so exasperated Prince <HI>Owen</HI> against his Brother <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> that together with his Son <HI>Howel,</HI> he marched with an army into his Brothers Country, and after a considerable Waste and Destruction, burnt to the ground the Castle of <HI>Aberystwyth. Cadwalader,</HI> upon the News of Prince <HI>Owen</HI>'s approach, withdrew himself and fled to <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> where having hired a great number of <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> for Two Thousand Marks, under the Com∣mand of <HI>Octer,</HI> and the Sons of <HI>Turkel</HI> and <HI>Cherulf,</HI> he struck sail for <HI>Wales,</HI> and landed at <HI>Abermenay</HI> in <HI>Carnarvonshire.</HI> The Prince, to protract no time, marched with all speed to prevent their farther pro∣gress into the Country; and both Armies being come in view of each other, a Peace was happily
<PB N="164" REF="119"/> concluded betwixt the two Brothers. The <HI>Irish</HI> un∣derstanding this, and how that their coming over was like to prove but a Fool's Errant to them, they surprized and secured <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> till their Wages and Arrears were paid; who, to obtain his Liberty, deliver'd to them two thousand Heads of Cattel, be∣sides many Prisoners, and other Booty, which they had taken in the Country. But as soon as the Prince was informed that his Brother <HI>Cadwalader</HI> was set loose, without any farther demur upon the case, he fell in upon the <HI>Irish,</HI> and having slain a very con∣siderable number of them, recovered all the Booty they purposed to ship off, and forced as many as could escape, to return with great loss, and a grea∣ter shame back to <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Normans</HI> sped far better in <HI>Wales; Hugh</HI> Son to <HI>Radulph</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> having fortified his Castle of <HI>Cymaron,</HI> set upon and won the Country of <HI>Melienyth</HI> a second time; and the Castle of <HI>Clun</HI> being fortified by another Lord, all <HI>Eluel</HI> became subject to the <HI>Normans.</HI> The same time King <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> took <HI>Geffry Mandeville</HI> Prisoner at S. <HI>Albans,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> by the slip of his Horse was like to be drowned in the River. But the Earl of <HI>Mandeville,</HI> to obtain his liberty, delivered up to the King the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> with the Castles of <HI>Walden</HI> and <HI>Plassey,</HI> which reduced him to that con∣dition, that he was forced to live upon the Plunder and Spoil of Abbies and other religious Houses, till at length he was slain in a Skirmish against the King, and his Son banished the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The next Year a Skirmish happened betwixt <HI>Hugh <MILESTONE N="1144" UNIT="A.D."/> de Mortimer</HI> and <HI>Rhys ap Howel,</HI> wherein the latter was taken Prisoner, with many others of his Ac∣complices, who were all committed to Prison by the <HI>English.</HI> But it fared much better with <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>Conan</HI> the Sons of Prince <HI>Owen,</HI> who having raised an Army against the <HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> gain'd a considerable Victory at <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> and having placed a Garrison in the Town, returned home with great Honour, and much Booty. About the same time,
<PB N="165" REF="119"/> <HI>Sulien ap Rhythmarch,</HI> one of the Colledg of <HI>Lhan∣badarn,</HI> and a Person of great Reading and extensive Learning, departed this Life. Shortly after, <HI>Gilbert</HI> Earl of <HI>Clare,</HI> came with a great number of Forces to <HI>Dyfed,</HI> and built the Castle of <HI>Caermardhyn,</HI> and the Castle of the Sons of <HI>Ʋchtryd. Hugh Morti∣mer</HI><MILESTONE N="1145" UNIT="A.D."/> likewise slew <HI>Meyric ap Madawc ap Riryd ap Bleddu,</HI> and <HI>Meredic ap Madawc ap Ednerth.</HI> And so far it went of the side of the <HI>English;</HI> but now the <HI>Welch</HI> begin to gain ground; <HI>Cadelh</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruf∣fydh ap Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South Wales,</HI> laid siege to the Castle of <HI>Dynefowr,</HI> belonging to Earl <HI>Gilbert,</HI> which being surrender'd up, <HI>Cadelh,</HI> assisted by his Brethren <HI>Meredith</HI> and <HI>Rhys,</HI> brought his Army before the Ca∣stle of <HI>Caermardhyn,</HI> which after a short siege yiel∣ded in like manner, reserving only this one Condition, that the Garison should not be put to the Sword. From thence he marched to <HI>Lhanstephan,</HI> and set be∣fore the Castle; to the Relief of which the <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Flemings</HI> coming with their Forces, were shame∣fully vanquished and overcome, and so the Castle was easily deliver'd up to the <HI>Welch.</HI> But the <HI>Normans</HI> were so cruelly nettled at this, that they muster'd up all the Forces they could possibly draw together out of the neighbouring Countries, and unexpectedly sur∣rounded the Castle, intending by all possible means to recover the same. But the Governour, <HI>Meredith ap Gruffydh,</HI> a Man of great Years, and no less Expe∣rience, so animated and encouraged the besieged, that when the <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Flemings</HI> ventured to scale the Walls, they were bear back with such Vi∣gour, and Loss of their side, that at length they were compell'd to raise the Siege, and leave the <HI>Welch</HI> in possession of the Castle.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, <HI>Run</HI> the Son of Prince <HI>Owen</HI> of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> a Youth of excellent hopes, and in∣comparable Qualifications, dyed, whose Death his Father took so much to heart, that for some time he seemed to be past all Comfort, being faln into such a melancholy Disposition, that he was diverted with nothing but Retirement. But an Accident fell
<PB N="166" REF="120"/> out, which rouz'd him out of this lethargical Fit of Sorrow and Discontent; the Castle of <HI>Mould</HI> was so very strong and well garrison'd by the <HI>English,</HI> that it mightily annoyed the Country thereabouts, and had been frequently besieged, but could never be taken. Prince <HI>Owen</HI> at this time levied an Army and laid close siege to it; and the Garison for several as∣saults behaved it self so manfully, that the place seem∣ed impregnable and invincible. But the Presence and Example of Prince <HI>Owen</HI> so encouraged his Men, that they fell on with all possible Vigour and Might, and at last forced their entrance into the Castle. Ha∣ving put a great number of the Garrison to the Sword, and taken the rest Prisoners, the Castle was rased to the ground; and this fortunate Attempt so pleased the Prince, that he forgot all Sorrow for his Son, and returned to his usual Temper and accustomed Merri∣ments. At the same time, King <HI>Stephen</HI> of <HI>England</HI> obtained a remarkable Victory over his Enemies at <HI>Farendon;</HI> and although the ensuing Year <HI>Rondel</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> and he were reconciled, yet he thought it more adviseable to detain him Prisoner, though contrary to his promise, until such time as the Earl would deliver up the Castle of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> with all the Forts and places of strength in his custody.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1146" UNIT="A.D."/> The next Year, <HI>Cadelh, Meredith,</HI> and <HI>Rhys,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys ap Theodor,</HI> brought an Ar∣my before the Castle of <HI>Gwys;</HI> but finding themselves too weak to master it, they desired <HI>Howel,</HI> Son to Prince <HI>Owen Gwynedh,</HI> a Person famously remarkable for martial Endowments, to come to their assistance. <HI>Howel,</HI> who was ever very desirous to signalize him∣self, and to evidence his Valour to the World, rea∣dily consented to their Request; and having drawn his Forces together, marched directly towards <HI>Gwys,</HI> where being arrived, he was joyfully received, and honourably entertain'd by such Lords as desired his help. Having viewed the Strength and Fortification of the Castle, he found it was impracticable to take the place, without the Walls could be destroyed; and therefore he gave orders, that certain battering
<PB N="167" REF="120"/> Engines should be provided, whilst the rest should gaul and molest the besieged, by throwing of great Stones into the Castle. The Enemies perceiving what irresistible Preparations the Besiegers contrived, thought it to no purpose to withstand their Fury; and therefore to do that voluntarily which must be done by compulsion, they presently yielded up the Castle. Shortly after this a great Difference happen'd betwixt the Sons of Prince <HI>Owen, Howel,</HI> and <HI>Conan,</HI> and their Uncle <HI>Cadwalader;</HI> whereupon the former entered with an Army into the Country of <HI>Merionyth,</HI> and committed great Wastes and Hostilities there, inso∣much that the Inhabitants flock'd into Sanctuaries to save their Lives. But the young Lords finding what fearful and unstable condition the People were in, and the better to draw them to their side, issued out their Proclamation, assuring that all who would fa∣vour their Country, should not only enjoy their Lives, but their former Liberty and accustomed Priviledges; upon the publication of which Edict, the People re∣turned to their own Habitations. Having by this Stratagem brought all the Country under their own Pleasure and good Will, they lead their Army be∣fore the Castle of <HI>Cynfael,</HI> belonging to <HI>Cadwala∣der,</HI> which he had built and strongly fortified. The government of this Castle <HI>Cadwalader</HI> had commit∣ted to <HI>Merfyn,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Tygwyn,</HI> or the <HI>White-House;</HI> who being summoned to surrender, by the Brothers <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>Conan,</HI> did not only refuse, but defied their utmost Efforts upon the place. The Lords finding they could do no good by Threats and Menaces, judged it more convenient to make use of the other Extream; and therefore promised the Abbot a very high Reward, if he would deliver the Castle into their hands. But all proved to no effect, the Abbot being a Person of more Honesty and greater Honour, than to be corrupted to betray his Trust; told them flatly, That he would not de∣ceive his Masters expectation, and therefore would choose rather to dye with Honour, than to live with Shame. The Lords finding him inexorable, and withal
<PB N="168" REF="121"/> being vexed, that a Church-man should put such a stop to their fortunate Proceedings, made such a vi∣gorous Assault upon the Castle, that after they had pulled down some part of the Walls, they entred in by force, and ravaged so furiously, that they killed and wounded the whole Garrison, the <HI>Abbot</HI> only e∣scaping, who by the help of some of his Friends in <HI>Howel</HI>'s Army, got away safe. Towards the close of this Year, several Persons of Note departed this Life, among whom were <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and <HI>Gilbert</HI> Earl of <HI>Clare,</HI> as also <HI>Ʋchthryd</HI> Bishop of <HI>Llandaf,</HI> a Man of great Piety and Learning, in whose See succeeded <HI>Nicholas ab Gurgant.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1147" UNIT="A.D."/> The following Year also died <HI>Bernard</HI> Bishop of St. <HI>Davids,</HI> and was succeeded by <HI>David Fitzgerald,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1148" UNIT="A.D."/> then Archdeacon of <HI>Cardigan.</HI> Sometime after Prince <HI>Owen Gwynedh</HI> built a Castle in <HI>Yale,</HI> called <HI>Castelh y Rodwyth;</HI> and his Brother <HI>Cadwalader</HI> built another at <HI>Lhanrystid,</HI> and bestowed his part of <HI>Cardigan</HI> upon his Son <HI>Cadwgan.</HI> Also <HI>Madoc</HI> the Son of <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn</HI> founded the Castle of <HI>Oswestry,</HI> and gave his Nephews <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Meyric</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gruffydh ap Meredith</HI> his share of <HI>Cyfeilioc.</HI></P>

But it fared better with his Brother <HI>Howel,</HI> who having made his Uncle <HI>Cadwalader</HI> his Prisoner, reduced all his Country, together with his Castle subject to himself. In <HI>South-Wales,</HI> some Business of moment happened this Year; <HI>Cadelh</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> having fortified the Castle of <HI>Car∣mardhyn,</HI> marched with his Army towards <HI>Cydwely,</HI> wasted and destroyed the whole Country, and be∣ing returned home, joyned his Army with his Bro∣thers <HI>Meredith</HI> and <HI>Rhys,</HI> who entring into the Coun∣try of <HI>Cardigan,</HI> won that part called <HI>Is Aeron.</HI> This was succeeded by an Action of greater Importance in <HI>North-Wales;</HI> some irreconcilable Difference arising betwixt Prince <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Rondel</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="121"/> quickly broke out into open War. The Earl made all the possible Preparations the opportunity would permit, and drew together a considerable Army from all parts of <HI>England</HI> and which strengthened and incouraged him the more, he was joyned by <HI>Madoc ap Meredith</HI> Prince of <HI>Powys,</HI> who disdaining to hold his Lands of Prince <HI>Owen Gwynedh,</HI> chose rather to side with, and abet his Enemies. The Prince on the other hand was not backward in his Preparations, and perceiving the Enemy to come upon him, thought it not advisable to suffer him to advance too far into the Country, but to stop and prevent his Carreer before he should take too firm a footing in his Domi∣nions. To this end he marched with his whole Power as far as <HI>Counsylht,</HI> with full Resolution to give the Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> Battel, which the <HI>English</HI> were glad of, as thinking themselves far more nu∣merous, and much better Armed and Disciplined than the <HI>Welch.</HI> But both Armies having joyned Battel, they quickly faltered in their expectation of un∣doubted Success, and finding the <HI>Welch</HI> to press so irresistibly severe upon them, they thought it wiser to retire, and endeavour to save themselves by flight. But the <HI>Welch</HI> pursued them so hard, that few e∣scaped without being either slain or taken Prisoners, and they some of the Chief Commanders, who thro' the fleetness of their Horses, avoided the Fury of their pursuers.</P>
<P>The next Year, the Scene of Action removed to <MILESTONE N="1150" UNIT="A.D."/> <HI>South-Wales, Cadelh, Meredith</HI> and <HI>Rhys,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> being entred with an Army into <HI>Cardigan,</HI> wan all the Country from <HI>Howel</HI> the Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> Son, except∣ing the Castle of <HI>Lhanfihangel</HI> in <HI>Pengwern.</HI> The Siege of <HI>Lhanrystyd</HI> Castle proved so difficult and unmanagable, that the young Lords of <HI>South-Wales</HI> lost a great part of their bravest Souldiers before it, which so troubled and vexed them, that when they got possession of the Castle, they put all the Garrison to the Sword. From thence they marched to <HI>Ystrat∣merric</HI> Castle, which after they had won, manned
<PB N="170" REF="122"/> and re-fortified, they disbanded their Forces, and re∣turned home. But <HI>Cadelh</HI> the eldest of the Brothers, was upon the point of receiving his last Blow by treachery at home, which he had escaped from the Enemies abroad. For some of the Inhabitants of <HI>Tenbigh</HI> in <HI>Pembroke shire,</HI> having conceived some displeasure and hatred against <HI>Cadelh,</HI> were resolved to revenge themselves, and to lay a Trap for his Life; and having observed what pleasure he took in Hunting, were resolved to execute their Plot, whilst he was hot and eager at his Sport. Observing there∣fore one day how he went a Hunting with only a few Companions, they placed themselves in an am∣buscade, and when the Game came that way, they unexpectedly set upon the unarmed Sports-men, and having easily made all the rest fly away, they wound∣ed <HI>Cadelh</HI> so cruelly, that he narrowly escaped their hands alive; who making shift to get home, lay for a long time dangerously ill, and with great difficulty at length recovered his Life. Upon this, his Bro∣thers <HI>Meredith</HI> and <HI>Rhys</HI> passed with an Army into <HI>Gwyr,</HI> and having burnt and destroyed the Country thereabouts, they besieged and took the Castle of <HI>Aberlhychwr,</HI> but finding they could not keep it, they rased it to the Ground, and after that, returned home with great Booty to <HI>Dynefawr,</HI> and repaired the For∣tifications of the Castle there. About the same time also, <HI>Howel,</HI> Prince <HI>Owen Gwynedh</HI>'s Son, fortified <HI>Humphry</HI>'s Castle in the Valley of <HI>Caletwr.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1151" UNIT="A.D."/> But the following Year, Prince <HI>Owen</HI> did a very barbarous Action to <HI>Cunetha,</HI> his Brother <HI>Cadwalhon</HI>'s Son, for fearing lest that this young Man should lay claim to any part of his Estate as his Father's right, he first pulled out his Eyes, and afterwards castrated him, for fear he should beget any Children, who might some time or other renew their claim and right to <HI>Cadwalhon</HI>'s Estate. This inhuman severity was succeeded by another of no small remark; <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> Son to <HI>Madoc ap Meredith</HI> having watched a convenient Opportunity, set upon, and slew <HI>Stephen</HI> the Son of <HI>Baldwin.</HI> But <HI>Cadwalader</HI> Prince <HI>Owen</HI>'s
<PB N="171" REF="122"/> Brother after a tedious Imprisonment which he had sustained thro' the Malice and Rancour of his Nephew <HI>Howel,</HI> at length made his escape, and flying to the Isle of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> brought a considerable part of that Island under his subjection. But Prince <HI>Owen</HI> hear∣ing how that his Brother had got loose from custody, and that he was in actual possession of a great part of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> he presently dispatched an Army over, which proving too formidable to <HI>Cadwalader</HI>'s Party, he was constrained to escape to <HI>England,</HI> and to de∣sire Succor from his Wife's Relations, who was the Daughter of <HI>Gilbert</HI> Earl of <HI>Clare.</HI> This Year <HI>Galfrede Arthur,</HI> commonly called <HI>Geffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> was made Bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> and at the same time <HI>Simon</HI> Archdeacon of <HI>Cyfeilioc,</HI> a Man of great Worth and Esteem in his Country died.</P>
<P>But the Year following, <HI>Meredith</HI> and <HI>Rhys</HI> the Sons <MILESTONE N="1152" UNIT="A.D."/> of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> laid Siege to <HI>Penwedic</HI> Castle, which belonged to <HI>Howel</HI> Prince <HI>Owen</HI>'s Son, and after great pains and considerable loss of Men of their side, at last made themselves Masters of it. From thence they marched by Night to <HI>Tenby,</HI> and unexpectedly falling upon the Castle, of which one <HI>William Fitzgerald</HI> was Governor, they scaled the Walls before the Garrison were aware of any Danger, and so possessing themselves of the Ca∣stle, they fell foul upon the Garrison, in Revenge of the Mischief they had done, and further designed to their Brother <HI>Cadelh.</HI> For <HI>Cadelh</HI> at this time was gone upon a Pilgrimage, and during his absence had committed his whole Inheritance and all other con∣cerns in <HI>Wales,</HI> to the Care of his Brethren <HI>Meredith</HI> and <HI>Rhys.</HI> But after the taking <HI>Tenby</HI>-Castle, they divided their Army into two Parties, with one of which, <HI>Rhys</HI> marched to <HI>Ystratcongen,</HI> and after great havock and waste committed there, he passed to <HI>Cy∣feilioc,</HI> which fared in like manner with <HI>Ystratcongen. Meredith</HI> with the other Party sat before <HI>Aberavan</HI>-Castle, and after a short Siege won and got possession of it, and then returned home with very consider∣able Booty, and many rich Spoils. About the same
<PB N="172" REF="123"/> time <HI>Rondel</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> who had lived in conti∣nual Enmity and frequent Hostility with Prince <HI>Owen</HI> of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> departed this Life, leaving his Son <HI>Hugh</HI> to enjoy both his Titles and Estate in <HI>England,</HI> and to prosecute the Feuds and Hostilities against the <HI>Welch.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1153" UNIT="A.D."/> And shortly after died <HI>Meredith</HI> Son to <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> who was Lord of <HI>Cardigan Ystratywy</HI> and <HI>Dyfed,</HI> being not passed the Twenty Fifth Year of his Age, a Person of incomparable Va∣lor and Audacity, and in all his Warlike Attempts and Atchievements very Fortunate. He was pre∣sently followed by <HI>Geoffrey</HI> Bishop of <HI>Llandaf,</HI> a Man as Famous for Learning and a good Life, as the o∣ther was for Masculine Bravery and Martial Prowess. In <HI>England</HI> the face of things looked very lowring, <HI>Henry</HI> Surnamed <HI>Shortmantel,</HI> the Empress Son, land∣ed in <HI>England,</HI> and in his progress thro' the Country took several Castles, among which were <HI>Malmesbury, Wallingford</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> But his Fury was quick∣ly appeased by the Death of <HI>Eustace</HI> King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Son, so that the sole obstacle for his succeeding to the Crown, being now removed, he willingly concluded a Peace with King <HI>Stephen,</HI> permitting him to enjoy the Crown peaceably for his life, upon Condition <MILESTONE N="1154" UNIT="A.D"/> that himself was declared his Successor. But King <HI>Stephen</HI> did not long survive this Treaty, and then <HI>Henry Plantagenet,</HI> the Empress Son, was Crowned in <MILESTONE N="1155" UNIT="A.D."/> his stead. Towards the beginning of King <HI>Henry</HI>'s reign, <HI>Rhys Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> King of <HI>South Wales,</HI> upon apprehension that <HI>Owen Gwynedh</HI> had raised an Army for the Conquest of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> drew toge∣ther all his Strength, and marched to <HI>Aberdyfi</HI> to face the Enemy upon their own Borders. But finding the Rumor to be false, and that the Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> had no such Design in hand, having built a Castle at <HI>Aberdyfi,</HI> which might defend the Frontiers from any future Design of his Country, he returned back without attempting any thing farther. At the same time, <HI>Madoc ap Meredith</HI> built a Castle at <HI>Cae∣reneon</HI> near <HI>Cymer,</HI> and then <HI>Eglwys Fair</HI> in <HI>Myfot,</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="123"/> was founded. About this time also, <HI>Meyric</HI> Nephew to Prince <HI>Madoc ap Meredith</HI> made his escape out of Prison, wherein he had been detained by his Uncle for a considerable time.</P>
<P>The same Year King <HI>Henry</HI> being displeased with the <HI>Flemings</HI> whom his Predecessor King <HI>Stephen</HI> had brought over into <HI>England,</HI> issued out a Proclama∣tion, charging the greatest part of them to depart his Dominions, and to retire to their Country-men in <HI>West-Wales,</HI> where his Grandfather <HI>Henry</HI> the First the <HI>Bastard</HI>'s Son had planted them. And thus that part of <HI>Wales</HI> called <HI>Pembroke-shire,</HI> was over-run with these Strangers, who being better befriended by the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> than the <HI>Welch</HI> could well ex∣pect to be, made sure footing in that Country, where they have ever since continued firm. It was the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Policy of those times to accept of any oppor∣tunity to curb and keep under the <HI>Welch,</HI> whom they experienced to be none of the safest Neighbours, and therefore the Kings of <HI>England</HI> did grant any Lands and Privileges in <HI>Wales</HI> to any that would accept of them, which honestly they had no Power to bestow.</P>
<P>But this was not enough in detriment to the <HI>Welch,</HI><MILESTONE N="1156" UNIT="A.D."/> for the Year following, King <HI>Henry</HI> raised a very great Army which he gathered from all parts of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> with purpose to subdue all <HI>North-Wales,</HI> being principally moved hereto, by the instigation of <HI>Cad∣walader</HI> the Prince's Brother, whom <HI>Owen Gwynedh,</HI> for what Reasons not known, deprived of his Estate, and banished the Country. Also <HI>Madoc ap Meredith</HI> Prince of <HI>Powis,</HI> who maligned the Liberty and Pri∣viledge of the Princes of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> who owned subjection to no other than the King of <HI>England,</HI> whereas those of <HI>Powis</HI> were obliged to do homage to the Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> did joyntly consent to this Invitation. The King of <HI>England</HI> accepting of their Proposals, led his Army to <HI>West-Chester,</HI> and encamped upon the Marsh called <HI>Saltney,</HI> in <HI>Welch, Morfa-Caer-Lleon.</HI> Prince <HI>Owen</HI> all this while was not ignorant of this intended Invasion, and therefore
<PB N="174" REF="124"/> having made all possible Preparations to confront the Enemy, he marched his Army to the Frontiers of <HI>England,</HI> and encamping at <HI>Basingwerk,</HI> resolved to give the <HI>English</HI> Battel. King <HI>Henry</HI> understanding of the Prince's Resolution, detached some of the chiefest Troops out of the Main-body, under the command of several Earls and other Lords, and sent them towards the Prince's Camp. But after they had advanced some little way, and were passing thro' a Wood, called <HI>Coed-Eulo, David</HI> and <HI>Conan</HI> Prince <HI>Owen</HI>'s Sons, unexpectedly set upon them, and what by the advantage of the Ground, and the sud∣deness of the Action, the <HI>English</HI> were born down with a great Slaughter, and those who survived, nar∣rowly escaped to the King's Camp. This was a very unwelcome beginning to King <HI>Henry;</HI> but however, in order to prosper better hereafter, he thought it ad∣visable to decamp from <HI>Saltney,</HI> and to rank his Troops along the Sea-Coast, thinking thereby to get betwixt Prince <HI>Owen</HI> and his Country, which if he could effect, he was sure to reduce the <HI>Welch</HI> to a very great inconveniency. But the Prince fore∣seeing the Danger of this, retired with his Army to a place called <HI>Cîl Owen,</HI> that is, <HI>Owen</HI>'s Retreat, which when King <HI>Henry</HI> perceived, he let fall his De∣sign,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> and came to <HI>Ruthlan. W. Parnus</HI> writes, that in this Expedition against the <HI>Welch,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> was in great danger of his Life, in passing thro' a strait at <HI>Counsylth</HI> near <HI>Flint,</HI> where <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who by inheritance enjoyed the Office of bearing the Standard of <HI>England,</HI> being over-charged by the Enemy, cast down the same and fled. This acci∣dent so incouraged the <HI>Welch,</HI> that they bore on so violently, that the King himself narrowly escaped, having of his Party <HI>Eustace Fitz-John</HI> and <HI>Rob. Curcie,</HI> two valiant Knights, together with several others of his Nobility and Gentry slain in the Action.</P>
<P>After this Prince <HI>Owen</HI> decamped from <HI>Cîl Owen,</HI> and intrenched himself upon <HI>Bryn y Pin,</HI> where lit∣tle of moment passed betwixt the two Armies, only some slight Skirmishes happened frequently. King
<PB N="175" REF="124"/> <HI>Henry</HI> in the mean time fortified the Castle of <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> and during his stay there, <HI>Madoc ap Meredith</HI> Prince of <HI>Powis,</HI> sailed with the <HI>English</HI> Fleet to <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and having put some Men on shoar, they burnt two Churches, and ravaged part of the Country about. But they paid very dear for it, for all the Strength of the Island being met together, they set upon them in their return to their Ships, and cut them off in such a manner, that not one remained to bring Tidings to the Fleet of what had befel them. But they on Board quickly perceived what had happened, and therefore thought it not very safe harbouring upon that Coast, but judging it more advisable to weigh Anchor, they presently set Sail for <HI>Chester;</HI> when they were arrived thither, they found that a Peace was actually concluded betwixt King <HI>Henry</HI> and Prince <HI>Owen</HI> upon these Articles; That <HI>Cadwalader</HI> should have all his Lands restored to him, and he re∣ceived to the Favour and Friendship of his Brother. Then King <HI>Henry</HI> leaving the Castles of <HI>Ruthlan</HI> and <HI>Basingwerk</HI> well manned and fortified, and having near the latter founded a Publick Structure for the Order of Knights Templars, returned to <HI>England.</HI> But the troubles of <HI>Wales</HI> did not end with him, for <HI>Iorwerdh Goch ap Meredith</HI> who had taken part with the King of <HI>England</HI> during this War, laid Siege to the Castle of <HI>Yale,</HI> which was built by Prince <HI>Owen,</HI> and making himself Master of it, rased it to the ground.</P>
<P>The next Year commenced with a very unfortu∣nate <MILESTONE N="1157" UNIT="A.D."/> Action, <HI>Ifor ap Meyric</HI> having long before cast a very wishful Eye upon the Land and Estate of <HI>Morgan ab Owen,</HI> was now resolved to put in exe∣cution what he had before contrived; and as Co∣vetousness seldom bears any regard to Vertue or Honor, he treacherously set upon him, and slew him; and with him fell <HI>Gurgan ap Rhys,</HI> the most Famous <HI>British</HI> Poet of his time. <HI>Morgan</HI>'s Estate <HI>Ifor</HI> bestowed upon his Brother <HI>Iorwerth,</HI> who about the same time got also possession of the Town of <HI>Caer-Lheon.</HI> But these inward and home-bread Di∣sturbances
<PB N="176" REF="125"/> were quickly mitigated by a general Peace which was presently after this concluded betwixt the King of <HI>England</HI> and all the Princes and Lords of <HI>Wales, Rhys ab Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales</HI> only excepted. For this Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> who probably would not rely too far upon the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Fidelity, refused to consent to a Peace; but however, to secure himself the best he could from the <HI>English,</HI> whom he had no small reason to be afraid of, he thought it his best Prudence to issue out his Orders, commanding his Subjects to remove their Cattel and other Effects to the Wilderness of <HI>Tywy,</HI> where they were like to remain securest from the Eyes and reach of the Enemies. But he had not continued there long, when he received a more po∣sitive Express from King <HI>Henry,</HI> commanding him to appear forthwith at his Court, and to accept of the Proposals of Peace, before the joynt Forces of <HI>En∣gland</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> were sent to fetch him up. Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> having received such a threatning Message, thought it now high time to repent of what he had afore so rashly resolved upon, and therefore after long Consultation, he judged it his wisest way to accept of the King's Proposals and to appear at Court. There it was agreed upon, that <HI>Rhys,</HI> whose Lands heretofore lay scattered about, and were intermixed with other Per∣son's Estate, should enjoy <HI>Cantref Mawr,</HI> and any o∣ther Cantref which the King should be pleased to be∣stow upon him. But contrary to this Article, the King assigned him several Lordships and other Lands far remote from each other, and particularly inter∣mixed them with the Estates of <HI>English-men,</HI> whom he was sure would be a watch and a curb to all the motions of Prince <HI>Rhys.</HI> This was indeed a very po∣litick Contrivance or King <HI>Henry</HI> to keep under the high and restless Spirit of <HI>Rhys;</HI> but the Justice of the Action does not so evidently appear in breaking one of the chiefest Articles of the Peace, and chopping and bestowing that which was not justly in his Power to give. But 'tis manifestly apparent that the <HI>English</HI> of these times were mainly concerned right
<PB N="177" REF="125"/> or wrong to oppress and keep under the <HI>Welch</HI> of whose mortal hatred to subjection they had so fre∣quently and so cruelly felt. Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> was not at all ignorant of these wrongful and deceitful Deal∣ings of King <HI>Henry,</HI> but knowing himself to be un∣able to redress these Grievances, he thought it more advisible for a time to live quietly with a little than rashly to hazard all. But in a short time, he had op∣portunity either to demand redress from the King, or else to endeavour it himself by Force of Arms. For as soon as <HI>Roger</HI> Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> was informed of the distribution which the King of <HI>England</HI> had grant∣ed to Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> he came to King <HI>Henry,</HI> request∣ing of his Majesty, that he would grant him such Lands in <HI>Wales,</HI> as he could win by force of Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The King readily complied with his Request, being always very forward to grant any thing which seem∣ed to curb and discommode the <HI>Welch,</HI> and there∣fore the Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> marched with a great Army into <HI>Cardigan,</HI> and having fortified the Castles of <HI>Ystrat-Meyric, Humphrey, Dyfi, Dynerth</HI> and <HI>Lhanrhy∣styd,</HI> he made several Incursions into the Country. In the same manner, <HI>Walter Clyfford</HI> who was Gover∣nour of <HI>Lhanymdhyfri</HI> Castle, made in-roads into the Territories of Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> and after he had slain se∣veral of the <HI>Welch,</HI> and made great waste in the Country, returned with considerable Booty.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> as he was unable to bear these out∣rages, so he was resolved either to have immediate redress, or else to proclaim open War against the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> and therefore he sent an Express to King <HI>Henry,</HI> complaining of the Hostilities which his Subjects the Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> and <HI>Walter Clifford</HI> had committed in in his Country. But finding the King to put him still off with only smooth Words and fair Promises, and that he always winked at the Faults of the <HI>En∣glish</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> without any farther Consultation about the Matter, he laid Siege to the Castle of <HI>Lhan∣ymdhyfri,</HI> and in short time made himself Matter of it. Also <HI>Eineon</HI> the Son of <HI>Anarawd, Rhy</HI>'s Brother's Son, and a Person of great Valor, being desirous to
<PB N="178" REF="126"/> free his Country from that miserable servitude they now groaned under, and judging withal that his Uncle was now discharged from the Oath he had lately sworn to the King of <HI>England,</HI> sat before the Castle of <HI>Humphrey,</HI> and having forcibly made his entrance into it, he put all the Garrison to the Sword, where he found a great number of Horses and Armour, e∣nough to arm a considerable Body of Men And whilst <HI>Eineon</HI> was thus engaged at <HI>Humphrey</HI>'s Castle, Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> perceiving that he could not enjoy any part of his Inheritance but what he afterwards got by the Sword, drew all his Power together and en∣tred <HI>Cardigan,</HI> where like a most violent Torrent, he over-run the Country, that he left not one Castle standing of those which his Enemies had fortified, and so brought all the Country to his subjection, King <HI>Henry</HI> being sore offended at the progress which Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> so suddenly made against him, returned with a great Army into <HI>South-Wales,</HI> but finding it to no purpose to attempt any thing against the Prince, he thought it more advisable to permit him to enjoy all that he had gotten, and only to take Hostages for his observing of Peace during his absence out of the Kingdom, which Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> promising to do, he forthwith returned to <HI>England,</HI> and soon after went for <HI>Normandy,</HI> where he concluded a Peace with the <HI>French</HI> King.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1158" UNIT="A.D."/> But the Year following, Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> of <HI>South-Wales</HI> without any respect to his promise to King <HI>Henry</HI> last Year, led his Forces to <HI>Dyfed,</HI> and destroyed all the Castles that the <HI>Normans</HI> had fortified in that Coun∣try, and then laid Siege to <HI>Caermardhyn.</HI> But <HI>Reynold</HI> Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the King's base Son, being informed of it, called together the Earl of <HI>Clare,</HI> his Bro∣ther-in-Law <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> Prince <HI>Owen</HI> of <HI>North-Wales</HI>'s Brother, <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>Conan Owen</HI>'s Sons, with two Earls more, who with their joynt Forces march∣ed to raise the Siege. But Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> was wiser than to abide their coming, and therefore upon the first intimation of such great Opposition, he retired to the Mountains called <HI>Cefn Rester,</HI> and there en∣camped,
<PB N="179" REF="126"/> being sufficiently secure from any Enemy, by the natural Fortification of the place. The Con∣federate Army lay at <HI>Dynwylhîr;</HI> and there built a Castle, but finding no news or tidings of Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> they returned home without effecting any thing of Note. King <HI>Henry</HI> was still in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and there made War against the Earl of St. <HI>Giles,</HI> for the City and Earldom of <HI>Tholouse.</HI></P>
<P>Towards the beginning of this Year, <HI>Madoc ap Meredith ap Blethyn</HI> Prince of <HI>Powis</HI> died at <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> whence his Body was honourably conveyed to <HI>Powis,</HI> and buried at <HI>Myfod.</HI> He was a Prince very much affected to Piety and Religion, very cha∣ritable to the necessitous, and good to the distressed; but his great Fault was, that he stickled too hard for the Interest of the <HI>English,</HI> and was always in Confe∣deracy with King <HI>Henry</HI> against the good Success of his Native Country. He had Issue by his Wife <HI>Su∣sanna,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> three Sons, <HI>Gruffydh Maylor, Owen</HI> and <HI>Elis,</HI> and a Daughter named <HI>Marred.</HI> He had also three natural Sons, <HI>Owen Brogynton, Cynwric Efelh,</HI> and <HI>Eineon Efelh,</HI> who tho' base born, yet according to the Custom of <HI>Wales,</HI> co-inherited with their Bre∣thren who were legitimate.</P>
<P>And here it will not be amiss, once for all, to give a particular account of the Principality, afterwards the Lordships of <HI>Powis,</HI> how it came to be di∣vided into many shares and portions, and by that means became so irrecoverably broken and weaken∣ed, that it was made subject to the <HI>Normans</HI> before the rest of <HI>Wales.</HI> For <HI>Powis</HI> before King <HI>Offa</HI>'s time, reached Eastward to the Rivers of <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> in a right Line from the end of <HI>Broxen</HI> Hills to <HI>Salop,</HI> and comprehended all the Country between the <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Severn,</HI> which was antiently the Estate of <HI>Broch∣wel Yscithroc,</HI> of whom mention is made before. But after the making of <HI>Offa</HI>'s dike, <HI>Powis</HI> was con∣tracted into a narrower compass, the plain Country toward <HI>Salop</HI> being inhabited by <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> so that the length of it reached North-East, from

Owen Madawc</HI> had to his Portion <HI>Me∣chain-Is-Coed,</HI> and had Issue <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> and <HI>Owen Fy∣chan.</HI> But <HI>Gruffydh Maelor</HI> the eldest Son, Lord of <HI>Bromfield,</HI> had to his part, both the <HI>Maelors</HI> with <HI>Moch∣nant-is-Raydar,</HI> and married <HI>Angharad</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Owen Gwynedh</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> by whom he had Issue one Son named <HI>Madawc,</HI> who held his Fa∣ther's Inheritance intirely, and left it so to his only Son <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> who was called, Lord of <HI>Dînas Brân,</HI> because he lived in that Castle: He married <HI>Emma</HI> the Daughter <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> by whom he had Issue <HI>Madawc, Lhewelyn, Gruffydh</HI> and <HI>Owen.</HI> This <HI>Gruffydh ap Madawc</HI> took part with King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the First against the Prince of <HI>North-Wales;</HI> and therefore for fear of the said Prince, he was forced to keep himself secure within his Ca∣stle of <HI>Dinas Brân,</HI> which being situated upon the summity of a very steep Hill, seemed impregnable to all the daring Efforts, that could be used against it. After his death, <HI>Edward</HI> the first dealt very unkind∣ly with his Children who were of Age to manage

But Earl <HI>Warren</HI> and <HI>Roger Mortimer,</HI> forgetting what signal Service <HI>Gruffydh ap Madoc</HI> had performed for the King, guarded their new Possessions with such caution and strictness, that they took especial care they should never return to any of the Posterity of the legal Proprietor; and therefore having obtained the King's Patent, they began to secure themselves in the said Lordships. <HI>John</HI> Earl <HI>Warren</HI> began to build <HI>Holt</HI>-Castle, which was finished by his Son <HI>William,</HI> and so the Lordships of <HI>Bromfield</HI> and <HI>Yale</HI> continued in the name of the Earls of <HI>Warren</HI> for three Descents, <HI>viz.

<PB N="184" REF="129"/>
<P>This <HI>John Charleton</HI> Lord <HI>Powys,</HI> being aided and supported by the King of <HI>England,</HI> quickly broke all their Measures; and having taken <HI>Lhewelyn, John,</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> his Wives Uncles, he put them in safe custody, in the Kings Castle of <HI>Harlech;</HI> and then obtained a Writ from the King to the Sheriff of <HI>Shrop∣shire,</HI> and to Sir <HI>Roger Mortimer,</HI> Lord of <HI>Chirkland,</HI> and Justice of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> for the Apprehension of <HI>Gruffydh Fychan,</HI> with his Sons in Law, Sir <HI>Roger Chamber</HI> and <HI>Hugh Montgomery,</HI> who were then in actual Hostility against him and his Wife <HI>Hawys.</HI> But <HI>Gruffydh Fychan</HI> and his Accomplices suspecting their own Strength, and having lost <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> their main support, thought it most advi∣sable to submit themselves to the King's Pleasure, touching the Difference betwixt them and <HI>Hawys;</HI> who finding upon record, how that <HI>Gruffydh ap Me∣redith,</HI> Ancestor to the said <HI>Hawys,</HI> upon his Submis∣sion to King <HI>Henry</HI> the First, became Subject to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and thereupon was created Baron of <HI>Powys,</HI> which Barony he and his Posterity had ever since held <HI>in capite</HI> from the King; was of opinion, that <HI>Hawys</HI> had more Right to her Fathers Posses∣sions now in their hands, than any pretence they could lay to her Estate. But to make a final deter∣mination of this matter, and to compose the Diffe∣rence more amicably betwixt them; it was agreed, that <HI>Hawys</HI> should enjoy her Inheritance in Fee-Sim∣ple to her and her Heirs for ever, after the Tenure of <HI>England;</HI> and that her Uncles <HI>Lhewelyn, John, Da∣vid,</HI> and <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> should quietly enjoy their Por∣tion, and the same to descend to their Heir Males perpetually; but in default of such Heir Males, the same was to descend to <HI>Hawys</HI> and her Heirs. But <HI>William</HI> Lord of <HI>Mowdhwy,</HI> the Fourth Brother, called otherwise <HI>Wilcock Mowdhwy,</HI> because he did not joyn with the rest against <HI>Hawys,</HI> had all his Lands confirmed to him, and to all his Heirs, both Male and Female for ever.

<P>About the same time that the Prince of <HI>Powys</HI> dyed, <HI>Cadwalhon ap Madawc ap Ednerth,</HI> who had been for some considerable time at variance with his Bro∣ther <HI>Eineon Clyd,</HI> was taken Prisoner by him; who deliver'd him up to <HI>Owen</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales.</HI> But the Prince being willing to gratifie the King of <HI>England,</HI> whose Interest <HI>Cadwalhon</HI> has as much as in him lay opposed, sent him to the King's Officers to be imprisoned at <HI>Winchester;</HI> from whence he quick∣ly found a way to escape: And by the advice of the rest of his Brethren, he returned home to his Coun∣try. King <HI>Henry</HI> continued all this while in <HI>Nor∣mandy,</HI> and during his stay there, a Match was con∣cluded upon betwixt his Son <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter to <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France.</HI> But this new alliance could not prevent these two Monarchs from <MILESTONE N="1160" UNIT="A.D."/> falling at variance with each other, which happened the Year following; and thereupon King <HI>Henry</HI> mar∣ched with his Army to <HI>Gascoyne,</HI> to quell certain Re∣bels, who upon first notice of this Breach between both Kings, were up in Arms against the <HI>English.</HI> But the next Year, a Peace was again concluded, and so all things returned to their former state of <MILESTONE N="1161" UNIT="A.D."/> Amity and Quietness.

The People of the Country perceiving these Devastations of the <HI>North-Wales</HI> Men, came together to the num∣ber of 300 Men, offering their Service to their na∣tural

<P><MILESTONE N="1162" UNIT="A.D."/> The Year following, the like thing happened; <HI>Owen</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Meredith,</HI> commonly called <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc o Wynedh,</HI> together with <HI>Owen ap Madawc ap Meredith,</HI> and <HI>Meredith ap Howel,</HI> set upon <HI>Carrechofa</HI> Castle near <HI>Oswestry,</HI> and having over-power'd the Garison, committed great Waste and Destruction therein. But about the same time, a pleasant passage happened in <HI>England; Robert Mount∣ford</HI> and <HI>Henry de Essex,</HI> who had both fought against the <HI>Welch</HI> upon the Marches, and both run, began now to impeach each other, as being the first occa∣sion of flying. The Dispute was to be tryed by Combat, in which being engaged, <HI>Henry</HI> was over∣come; and for his false accusing of <HI>Robert,</HI> he was sentenced to have his Estate forfeited, and then ha∣ving his Crown shorn, he was entered a Monk at <HI>Redding.</HI> Within a little after, King <HI>Henry</HI> calling to mind what Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> had committed during his absence out of the Kingdom, drew up a great Army against <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and having marched as far as <HI>Pencadyr</HI> near <HI>Brecknock, Rhys</HI> met him, and did his Homage; and having delivered up Hostages for his future Behaviour, stopp'd the King's farther progress, so that thence he returned to <HI>England.</HI> But after the King's departure, two very unlucky Accidents happened in <HI>Wales; Eineon</HI> the Son of <HI>Anarawd ap Gruffydh,</HI> Nephew to Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> being villainously murthered in his Bed by his own Servant, called <HI>Walter ap Lhywarch;</HI> as also <HI>Cadwgan ap Meredith</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="131"/> in like manner, by one <HI>Walter ap Riccart.</HI> But the loss of his Nephew, Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> made up, by posses∣sing himself of that large Country called <HI>Cantref Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Dynefowr,</HI> which he after∣wards enjoyed. Of men of Learning there dyed this Year, <HI>Cadifor ap Daniel,</HI> Archdeacon of <HI>Cardigan;</HI> and <HI>Henry ap Arthen,</HI> the greatest Scholar that had flourished in <HI>Wales</HI> for many Years.</P>
<P>The next Year, a total Rupture broke forth be∣twixt <MILESTONE N="1163" UNIT="A.D."/> the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welch;</HI> Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> a Man of an active and uncontroulable Spirit, being now experimentally sensible he could never carry on the Greatness and Grandeur of his Quality, with such lands as the King of <HI>England</HI> had allotted him, made an Invasion into the Lordship of <HI>Roger de Acre</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester;</HI> being moved thereto in a great measure, by reason that his Nephew <HI>Anarawd ap Gruf∣fydh</HI> was murthered by his motive and instigation. Being advanced with a strong Army into the Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI>'s Estate, without any great opposition he took <HI>Aberheidol</HI> Castle, with those belonging to the Sons of <HI>Wyhyaon;</HI> all which he rased to the ground. Thence he marched to <HI>Cardigan,</HI> bringing all that Country under his subjection; and from thence he marched against the <HI>Flemings,</HI> whose Country he cruelly harassed with Fire and Sword. The rest of the Estates of <HI>Wales,</HI> perceiving Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> to pros∣per so successfully against the <HI>English,</HI> thought they might equally succeed, and shake off the <HI>English</HI> Yoke, which so unreasonably oppressed them. And there∣fore they unanimously agreed to cast off their Subje∣ction to the <HI>English,</HI> whose Tyranny they could no longer bear, and to put over them Princes of their own Nation, whose Superiority they could better to∣lerate. And so this Year concluded with making suitable Preparations for the following Campaign.<MILESTONE N="1164" UNIT="A.D."/></P>
<P>And therefore as soon as the time of year for action was advanced, <HI>David</HI> Son of <HI>Owen</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> fell upon <HI>Flintshire,</HI> which pertained to the King of <HI>England;</HI> and carrying off all the People and Cattel with him, brought them to <HI>Dyffryn Clwyd,</HI> other∣wise

On the other side, Prince <HI>Owen</HI> and his Brother <HI>Cad∣walader,</HI> with all the strength of <HI>North-Wales;</HI> Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> with those of <HI>South-Wales; Owen Cyfeilioc</HI> and <HI>Madawc ap Meredith</HI> with all the Power of <HI>Powys;</HI> the two Sons of <HI>Madawc ap Ednerth,</HI> with the Peo∣ple living betwixt the Rivers of <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Wye,</HI> met together, and pitched their Camp at <HI>Corwen</HI> in <HI>Edeyrneon,</HI> intending unanimously to defend their Country against the King of <HI>England.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> understanding that they were so near, was very desirous to come to Battel; and to that end he removed to the Banks of the River <HI>Ceireoc,</HI> causing all the Woods thereabouts to be cut down, for fear of any Ambushment lurking therein, and for a more clear prospect of the Enemy. But some of the <HI>Welch</HI> took advantage of this opportunity, who being well acquainted with the Passage, without the knowledg of their Officers, fell upon the King's Guard, where all the Pike-men were posted; and after a hot Skir∣mish, several were slain on both sides. But in fine, the King wan the passage, and so marched on to the Mountain of <HI>Berwyn,</HI> where he lay sometime without any Hostility on either side, both Armies standing in fear of each other. The <HI>English</HI> kept the open Plains,
<PB N="191" REF="132"/> and were afraid to be entrapp'd in the Streights and narrow Passages; and the <HI>Welch</HI> on the other hand watched the Advantage of the place, and observed the <HI>English</HI> so narrowly, that neither Forage or Vi∣ctuals could pass to the King's Camp. And what augmented the misery of the <HI>English</HI> Army, there happened to fall such a Rain, that mightily disturbed their Encampment, in so much that the Soldiers could scarcely stand, for the disadvantage of those slippery Hills. But in the end King <HI>Henry</HI> was forced to de∣camp, and after a very considerable loss of Men and Ammunition, besides the great Charges of this Expe∣dition, was compell'd to return back to <HI>England.</HI> But to express the great dissatisfaction he entertained of this Enterprize, in a great fury he plucked out the Eyes of the Hostages, which he had some time afore received from the <HI>Welch;</HI> which were <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Cad∣walhon</HI> the Sons of <HI>Owen</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Cynric</HI> and <HI>Meredith</HI> the Sons of <HI>Rhys</HI> of <HI>South-Wales.</HI> Some write, that in assailing of a Bridg, the King was in no small danger of his Life; one of the <HI>Welch</HI> ha∣ving aimed directly at him, was like to pierce him through the Body, had not <HI>Hubert de Clare,</HI> Constable of <HI>Colchester,</HI> who perceived the Arrow a coming, thrust himself betwixt the King and it, though to the loss of his own Life.</P>
<P>But though King <HI>Henry</HI> was shamefully forced to return to <HI>England,</HI> yet he did not give over the thoughts of subduing the <HI>Welch;</HI> and therefore after a long Consultation, he made a third Expedition into <HI>Wales,</HI> conveying his Army by Sea, as far as <HI>Chester.</HI> There he staid for some time, till all his Fleet, as well those Ships that he had hired out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as his own, were all arrived. But when they were all come to∣gether, and got safely to <HI>Chester,</HI> his mind was alter∣ed; and instead of a design against <HI>Wales,</HI> he unex∣pectedly dismissed his whole Army. Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> was glad of this opportunity, and therefore withdrawing his Forces from the Confederate Army, he marched to the Siege of <HI>Aberteifi</HI> Castle, which being surren∣dred to him, he rased to the ground. From thence
<PB N="192" REF="133"/> he got before <HI>Cilgerran,</HI> which he used after the same manner, and therein took Prisoner <HI>Robert</HI> the Son of <HI>Stephen</HI> his Cosin-German, who was the Son of <HI>Nest</HI> his Aunt, who after the death of <HI>Gerald,</HI> had married <HI>Stephen</HI> Constable. The joy of these happy Successes on the part of the <HI>Welch,</HI> was somewhat clouded by the death of <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> Son of <HI>Owen</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> a Person of great Worth, and exceedingly well beloved of all his Country.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1165" UNIT="A.D."/> And now the <HI>Welch</HI> being something secure from any Invasion from the <HI>English;</HI> there rose up another Enemy to create them Disturbance; the <HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> finding the <HI>English</HI> to fail in their At∣tempt against the <HI>Welch,</HI> thought they might with better success quell and subdue them. And therefore they came to <HI>West-Wales</HI> with a great Army, and laid siege to the Castle of <HI>Cilgerran,</HI> which <HI>Rhys</HI> had lately fortified; but after two different Assaults, they were manfully beat back, and forced to depart home again. But what the <HI>Flemings</HI> could not effect against the <HI>Welch</HI> in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> the <HI>Welch</HI> easily brought about against the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>North-Wales;</HI> for Prince <HI>Owen</HI> having besieged <HI>Basingwerk</HI> Castle, then in the possession of the King of <HI>England,</HI> without much time spent, made himself Master of it. But it was always the misfortune of the <HI>Welch,</HI> that when they found themselves secure from any Enemy abroad, they were sure to quarrel and fall out at home; though in∣deed it could not be well otherwise expected, where so many petty States endeavoured still to surmount and out-vie one another. And now when all things went very successfully of their sides, in opposition to the <HI>English;</HI> two ambitious Persons began to kindle a Flame in their own bosoms; <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Maredith</HI> Lord of <HI>Powys,</HI> and <HI>Owen Fychan</HI> second Son to <HI>Madawc ap Meredith,</HI> forcibly dispossessed <HI>Iorwerth Goch</HI> of his Estate in <HI>Powys,</HI> which they divided betwixt themselves; <HI>Mochnant Ʋwch Ray∣adr</HI> to <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc,</HI> and <HI>Mochnant is Rayadr</HI> to <HI>Owen Fychan.</HI></P>
<PB N="193" REF="133"/>
<P>But the rest of the Princes of <HI>Wales</HI> could not brook this Injury done to <HI>Iorwerth Goch;</HI> and there∣fore <MILESTONE N="1166" UNIT="A.D."/> <HI>Owen</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> with his Brother <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> and <HI>Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> went with an Army into <HI>Powys</HI> against <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc,</HI> and having chased him out of the Country, they bestowed <HI>Caereneon</HI> upon <HI>Owen Fychan,</HI> to hold it of Prince <HI>Owen;</HI> and <HI>Rhys</HI> had <HI>Walwern,</HI> by reason that it lay near his own Territories. But within a while after, <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc</HI> returned with a numerous band of <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> and <HI>English</HI> along with him, and laid siege to the Castle of <HI>Caereneon,</HI> which he burnt to the ground. But the loss of this place was made up by the taking of <HI>Ruthlan</HI> Castle, which <HI>Owen, Rhys,</HI> and <HI>Cadwala∣der</HI> joyntly besieged; and which was so strongly for∣tified, and so manfully defended, that it cost them three Months before they could make themselves Masters of the place.

He was a wise and a valourous Prince, ever fortunate and victorious in all his Undertakings, insomuch, as he never undertook any Design but what he accomplish∣ed.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>David ap Owen.</HEAD>
<P>PRince <HI>Owen Gwynedh</HI> being dead, the Succession was of right to descend to his eldest legitimate Son, <HI>Iorwerth Drwyndwn,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Edward</HI> with the broken Nose; but by reason of that Ble∣mish upon his Face, he was laid aside as unfit to take upon him the Government of <HI>North-Wales.</HI> Therefore his younger Brothers began every one to aspire, in hopes of succeeding their Father; but <MILESTONE N="1170" UNIT="A.D."/><HI>Howel,</HI> who was of all the eldest, but base born, be∣gotten of an <HI>Irish</HI> Woman, finding they could not agree, stept in himself, and took upon him the Go∣vernment. But <HI>David,</HI> who was legitimately born, could not brook that a Bastard should ascend his Fa∣thers
<PB N="195" REF="134"/> Throne; and therefore he made all the Prepara∣tions possible to pull him down. <HI>Howel</HI> on the other hand was as resolute to maintain his ground, and was not willing so quickly to deliver up, what he had not very long got possession of; and so both Brothers meeting together in the Field, were resolved to try their Title by the point of the Sword. The Battel had not lasted long, but <HI>Howel</HI> was slain; and then <HI>David</HI> was unanimously proclaimed and saluted Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> which Principality he enjoyed with∣out any Molestation, till <HI>Lhewelyn, Iorwerth Druryn∣dwn</HI>'s Son came of age, as will hereafter appear. But <HI>Madawc,</HI> another of <HI>Owen Gwynedh</HI>'s Sons, find∣ing how his Brothers contended for the Principality, and that his native Country was like to be turmoil'd in a Civil War, did think it his better Prudence to try his Fortune abroad; and therefore leaving <HI>North-Wales</HI> in a very unsettled condition, sailed with a small Fleet of Ships which he had rigg'd and man'd for that purpose, to the Westward; and leaving <HI>Ire∣land</HI> upon the <HI>North,</HI> he came at length to an un∣known Country, where most things appeared to him new and uncustomary, and the manner of the Natives far different from what he had seen in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Country, says the learned <HI>H. Lhoyd,</HI> must of necessi∣ty be some part of that vast tract of ground, of which the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> since <HI>Hanno</HI>'s time, boast themselves to be the first Discoverers; and which by order of Cos∣mography, seems to be some part of <HI>Nova Hispania</HI> or <HI>Florida:</HI> whereby it is manifest, that this Country was discovered by the <HI>Britains,</HI> long before either <HI>Columbus</HI> or <HI>Americus Vesputius</HI> sailed thither. But concerning <HI>Madawc</HI>'s Voyage to this Country, and afterwards his return from thence; there be many fabulous Stories and idle Tales invented by the Vul∣gar, who are sure never to diminish from what they hear, but will add to and increase any Fable as far as their Invention will prompt them. However says the same Author, it is certain that <HI>Madawc</HI> arrived in this Country, and after he had viewed the Fertility and Pleasantness of it, he thought it expedient to invite
<PB N="196" REF="135"/> more of his Countrymen out of <HI>Britain;</HI> and there∣fore leaving most of those he had brought with him already behind, he returned for <HI>Wales.</HI> Being ar∣rived there, he began to acquaint his Friends with what a fair and extensive Land he had met with, void of any Inhabitants, whilst they employed all their Skill to supplant one another, only for a ragged Portion of Rocks and Mountains; and therefore he would persuade them to change their present state of Danger and continual Clashings for a more quiet Being of Ease and Enjoyment. And so having got a considerable Number of <HI>Welch</HI> together, he bid his final adieu to his Native Country, and sailed with Ten Ships back to them he had left behind. It is therefore to be supposed, says our Authour, that <HI>Ma∣dawc</HI> and his People inhabited part of that Country, since called <HI>Florida,</HI> by reason that it appears from <HI>Francis Loves,</HI> an Author of no small Reputation, that in <HI>Acusanus</HI> and other places, the People ho∣noured and worshipped the Cross; whence it may be naturally concluded, that Christians had been there before the coming of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and who these Christians might be, unless it were this Colony of <HI>Madawcs,</HI> cannot be easily imagined. But by rea∣son that the <HI>Welch</HI> who came over, were not many, they intermixt in a few Years with the Natives of the Country, and so following their Manners and using their Language, they became at length undi∣stinguishable from the Barbarians. But the Country which <HI>Madawc</HI> landed in is by the learned Dr. <HI>Powel</HI> supposed to be part <HI>Mexico;</HI> for which Conjecture he lays down these following Reasons; First, as it is recorded in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Chronicles of the Conquest of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> the Inhabitants and Natives of that Country affirm by Tradition, that their Rulers de∣scended from a strange Nation, which came thither from a strange Country; as it was confessed by King <HI>Montezeuma,</HI> in a Speech at his Submission to the King of <HI>Castile,</HI> before <HI>Hernando Cortez</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> General. And then the <HI>British</HI> Words and Names of Places used in that Country, even at this day do
<PB N="197" REF="135"/> undoubtedly argue the same; as when they speak and confabulate together, they use this <HI>British</HI> Word <HI>Gwrando,</HI> which signifies to hearken or listen; and a certain Bird with a white Head, they call <HI>Fengwyn,</HI> which signifies the same in <HI>Welch.</HI> But for a more complete confirmation of this, the Island of <HI>Corroeso,</HI> the Cape of <HI>Bryton,</HI> the River of <HI>Gwyndor,</HI> and the white Rock of <HI>Pengwyn,</HI> which are all <HI>British</HI> Words do manifestly shew, that it was that Country which <HI>Madawe</HI> and his People inhabited.</P>
<P>As soon as the Troubles of <HI>North-Wales</HI> were o∣ver, and Prince <HI>David</HI> securely settled in his Throne,<MILESTONE N="1171" UNIT="A.D."/> the Storm fell presently upon <HI>Powys:</HI> For <HI>Owen Cy∣feilioc</HI> the Lord of that Country, had always, as much as in him lay, opposed the Interest and Advantage of <HI>Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South Wales;</HI> upon which account Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> came with a great Army against <HI>Powys,</HI> and having subdued <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc</HI> his Enemy, he was for all that so favourable to him, that upon his deli∣vering him Pledges for his future Behaviour, he pre∣sently departed out of <HI>Powys,</HI> and returned with much Honour to <HI>South Wales.</HI> And now all the States of <HI>Britain</HI> being at perfect Rest and Amity with one another, the whole Tide and Scene of Action re∣turned to <HI>Ireland;</HI> for <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> having called together all his Nobility, began to consult about the <HI>Irish</HI> Expedition, which had already been deter∣mined to be taken in hand. To this Consultation there came some Messengers from <HI>Richard Strongbow</HI> Earl of <HI>Strigule</HI> Marshal of <HI>England,</HI> to deliver up to the Kings hands the City of <HI>Dublyn,</HI> the Town of <HI>Waterford,</HI> with all such Towns and Castles as he got in right of his Wife; whereupon the King restored to him all his Lands both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> and created him Lord Steward of <HI>Ireland.</HI> For this Earl of <HI>Strigule</HI> had lately, without the King's Per∣mission, gone over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had married the Daughter of <HI>Dermott</HI> King of <HI>Dublyn;</HI> which King <HI>Henry</HI> took in such an indignation, that he presently seized upon all his Lands in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Normandy.</HI> Therefore the King having now some footing in <HI>Ireland,</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="136"/> the Expedition was unanimously concluded upon; and so the King set upon his Journey, and coming towards <HI>Wales,</HI> he was received by Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> whose Sub∣mission the King liked so well, that he presently con∣firmed to him all his Lands in <HI>South-Wales.</HI> To re∣turn the King's Favour <HI>Rhys</HI> promised his Majesty 300 Horses and 4000 Oxen toward the Conquest of <HI>Ireland;</HI> for the sure payment of which, he delivered Fourteen Pledges. Then King <HI>Henry</HI> marching for∣ward, came to <HI>Caeriheon</HI> upon <HI>Ʋske,</HI> and entering the Town, he dispossessed the right Owner <HI>Iorwerth ap Owen ap Caradoc,</HI> and kept it for his own proper use, placing a Garrison of his own Men therein. But <HI>Ior∣werth</HI> was not so easie-mouth'd, as to be so unreasona∣bly curb'd by the King; and therefore departing in a great fury from the King's presence, he called to him his two Sons <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Howel,</HI> whom he had by <HI>Ang∣harad</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Ʋchtryd</HI> Bishop of <HI>Llandaf,</HI> and his Sisters Son <HI>Morgan ap Sitsylht ap Dyfnwal;</HI> and bringing together all the Forces they were able, upon the King's departure they entered the Country, and committing all the Waste and Destruction as they came along, they at last came before <HI>Caerlheon,</HI> which when they took, they used in the like manner, spoiling and destroying whatever they could meet with; so that nothing escaped their Fury, excepting the Castle, which they could not win. The King was in the mean time upon his Journey to <HI>Pembroke,</HI> where being accompa∣nied by Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> he gave him a grant of all <HI>Cardi∣gan, Ystratywy, Arustly,</HI> and <HI>Eluel;</HI> in Recompence of all the Civilities and Honour he paid him. And so <HI>Rhys</HI> returned to <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> a Town he had lately won from the Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and there having pre∣pared his Present, about the beginning of <HI>October</HI> he returned again to <HI>Pembrock,</HI> having ordered Eighty Six Horses to follow him; which being presented to the King, he accepted of Thirty Six of the choicest, and returned the rest with great Thanks. The same day King <HI>Henry</HI> went to S. <HI>Davids,</HI> and after he had of∣fered to the Memory of that Saint, he dined with the Bishop, who was the Son of <HI>Gerald,</HI> Cosin-German
<PB N="199" REF="136"/> to <HI>Rhys;</HI> whither <HI>Richard Strongbow</HI> Earl of <HI>Strygile</HI> came from <HI>Ireland</HI> to confer with the King. Within a while after, King <HI>Henry</HI> being entertained by <HI>Rhys</HI> at the <HI>White-House,</HI> restored to him his Son <HI>Howel,</HI> who had been for a considerable time detained as a Pledg, and appointed him a certain day for payment of his Tribute, at which time, all the rest of the Pledges should be set at liberty. The day following, being the next after the Feast of S. <HI>Luke,</HI> the King went on board, and the Wind blowing very favoura∣bly, set sail for <HI>Ireland;</HI> and being safely arrived up∣on those Coasts, he landed at <HI>Dublyn;</HI> where he rest∣ed for that whole Winter, in order to make greater Preparations against the following Campaign.</P>
<P>But the change of the Air and Climate occasion'd such a raging Distemper and Infection among the Sol∣diers, that to prevent the perishing of his whole Ar∣my,<MILESTONE N="1172" UNIT="A.D."/> the King was forced to return with what speed he could back for <HI>England;</HI> and so having shipp'd off all his Army and Effects, he loosed Anchor, and land∣ed in <HI>Wales</HI> in the Passion Week next Year, and com∣ing to <HI>Pembrock,</HI> he stayed there on <HI>Easter-day,</HI> and then proceeded upon his Journey towards <HI>England. Rhys</HI> hearing of the King's return, was very officious to pay him his Devotion, and would gladly feign to be one of the first who should welcome him over; and so meeting with him at <HI>Talacharn,</HI> he expressed all the Ceremonies of Duty and Allegiance. Then the King passed on, and as he came from <HI>Caerdyf</HI> by the new Ca∣stle upon <HI>Ʋsk,</HI> meaning to leave <HI>Wales</HI> in a peaceable condition, he sent for <HI>Iorwerth ap Owen ap Caradoc,</HI> who was the only Person in open Enmity against him, and that upon very just ground, willing him to come and treat about a Peace, and assuring him of a safe Conduct for himself, his Sons, and all the rest of his Associates. <HI>Iorwerth</HI> was willing to accept of the Pro∣posal, and thereupon set forward to meet the King, having sent an Express to his Son <HI>Owen,</HI> a valourous young Gentleman, to meet him by the way. <HI>Owen,</HI> according to his Fathers Orders set forward on his Journey, with a small retinue, without any thing of
<PB N="200" REF="137"/> Arms or Weapons of War, as thinking it Folly to clog himself with such needless Carriage, when the King had promised a safe Conduct. But he did not find it so safe; for as he passed the new Castle upon <HI>Ʋske,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI>'s Men, who were garrison'd therein, laid in wait for him as he came along, and setting cowardly upon him, slew him, with most of his Company. But some few escaped to acquaint his Father <HI>Iorwerth</HI> of such a treacherous Action; who hearing that his Son was so basely murthered, contra∣ry to the King's absolute promise of a safe Passage; without any farther consultation about the matter, presently returned home with <HI>Howel</HI> his Son, and all his Friends, and would no longer put any trust or con∣fidence in any thing that the King of <HI>England,</HI> or any of his Subjects, promised to do. But on the other side, to avenge the Death of his Son, who was so cowardly cut off; he presently raised all the Forces that himself and the rest of his Friends were able to do; and so entering into <HI>England,</HI> he destroyed with Fire and Sword all the Country, to the Gates of <HI>Here∣ford</HI> and <HI>Glocester.</HI> But the King was so intent upon his return, that he seemed to take no great notice of what <HI>Iorwerth</HI> was doing; and therefore having by Commission constituted Lord <HI>Rhys</HI> Chief Justice of all <HI>South-Wales,</HI> he forthwith took his Journey to <HI>Nor∣mandy.</HI> About this time dyed <HI>Cadwalader ap Gruffydh,</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan,</HI> sometime Prince of <HI>North-Wales;</HI> who by his Wife, <HI>Alice</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Richard Clare</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> had Issue, <HI>Cunetha, Radulph,</HI> and <HI>Richard;</HI> and by other Women, <HI>Cad∣fan, Cadwalader, Eineon, Meredith Goch,</HI> and <HI>Cad∣walhon.</HI> Towards the end of this Year <HI>Sitsylht ap Dyfn∣wal</HI> and <HI>Iefan ap Sitsylht ap Riryd,</HI> surprized the Castle of <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> which belonged to the King of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and having made themselves Masters of it, they took the whole Garrison Prisoners.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1173" UNIT="A.D."/> But the following Year, there happened a very great difference, and a falling out betwixt King <HI>Henry</HI> and his Son of the same Name; this latter being upholded by the Queen his Mother, his Brothers <HI>Geffrey</HI> and
<PB N="201" REF="137"/> <HI>Richard,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King, the Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> to∣gether with the Earl of <HI>Chester, William Patrick</HI> with several other valiant Knights and Gentlemen. But the old King having a stout and a faithful Army, consist∣ing of <HI>Almanes</HI> and <HI>Brabanters,</HI> was not in the least dismay'd or discourag'd at such a seeming Storm; and which made him more bold and adventurous, he was joyned by a strong Party of <HI>Welchmen,</HI> which Lord <HI>Rhys</HI> had sent him, under the command of his Son <HI>Howel.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> overthrew his Enemies in divers Encounters, and having either killed or taken Prison∣ers most of them who were rose up against him, he ea∣sily dissipated the Cloud which at first seemed so black and threatning. <HI>Iorwerth ap Owen</HI> was not very sory to see the <HI>English</HI> clash, and fall into civil Dissentions among themselves; and therefore taking advantage of such a seasonable opportunity, he drew his Army against <HI>Caerlheon,</HI> which stood out very stifly against him. But after many warm Disputes of both sides, <HI>Iorwerth</HI> at length prevailed, and entering the Town by force, he took most of the Inhabitants Prisoners; and then lay∣ing siege to the Castle, it was surrender'd up in ex∣change for the Prisoners he had taken in the Town. <HI>Howel</HI> his Son, at the same time was busie in <HI>Gwent îs Coed;</HI> and having reduced all that Country, excepting the Castle, to subjection, he took Pledges of the In∣habitants, to be true and faithful to him, and to with∣draw their Allegiance from the King of <HI>England.</HI> At the same time, something of action passed in <HI>North-Wales;</HI> for <HI>David ap Owen Gwynedh</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> bringing an Army over the River <HI>Menai</HI> into <HI>Anglesey</HI> against his Brother <HI>Maelgon,</HI> who kept that Island from him; forced him to make his escape to <HI>Ireland;</HI> in his return from whence the following Year, he was accidentally discovered and seized upon, and then by his Brothers orders committed to close Prison. Prince <HI>David</HI> having brought the Isle of <HI>Ang∣lesey</HI> to its pristine state of subjection to him, was re∣solved to move all manner of Obstacles which might at any time for the future endanger its falling off from him; and these he judged to be his own next Rela∣tions,
<PB N="202" REF="138"/>
<MILESTONE N="1174" UNIT="A.D."/> and therefore he expell'd and banish'd all his Brethren and Cosins out of his Territories of <HI>North-Wales.</HI> But before this Sentence was put in execu∣tion, his Brother <HI>Conan</HI> dyed, and so escaped the Ig∣nominy of being banished his native Country, for no other reason, but the Jealousie of an ambitious Bro∣ther.</P>
<P>About the same time, <HI>Howel</HI> the Son of <HI>Iorwerth ap Owen</HI> of <HI>Caerlheon,</HI> took Prisoner his Uncle <HI>Owen Pen∣carn,</HI> who was right Heir of <HI>Caerlheon</HI> and <HI>Gwent;</HI> and now having him secure, and to prevent his get∣ting any Children to inherit those places which him∣self was next Heir to, he first pulled out his Eyes, and then very inhumanly cut off his Testicles. But Ven∣geance did not permit such a base Action to go unpu∣nished; for upon the <HI>Saturday</HI> following, a great Ar∣my of <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Englishmen</HI> came unexpectedly before the Town, and wan both it and the Castle, notwithstanding all the Opposition which <HI>Howel</HI> and his Father <HI>Iorwerth</HI> made; though this last was not privy to his Sons Action. About the same time King <HI>Henry</HI> came over to <HI>England,</HI> a little after whose arri∣val, <HI>William</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Roger de Moubray</HI> were taken Prisoners at <HI>Alnewike</HI> by the Barons of the North, as they came to destroy the Northern part of the Country in the Quarrel of the young King. But old King <HI>Henry</HI> having committed them to the safe custody of the Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> and received <HI>Hugh Bygod</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> to his Mercy, returned to <HI>Nor∣mandy</HI> with a very considerable Army of <HI>Welchmen,</HI> which <HI>David</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> had sent him; in return of which, he gave him his Sister <HI>Emme</HI> in Mar∣riage. When he was arrived in <HI>Normandy,</HI> he sent a Detachment of the <HI>Welch</HI> to cut off some Provisions which were going to the Enemies Camp; but in the mean time, the <HI>French</HI> King came to a Treaty of Peace, which was shortly afterwards concluded upon; so that all the Brethren, who had all this time maintained such an unnatural Rebellion against their Father, were forced to beg the old King's Forgiveness and Pardon for all their former Misdemeanours. <HI>David</HI> Prince of
<PB N="203" REF="138"/> <HI>North-Wales</HI> began to grow very bold and assuming, by reason of his new Alliance with the King of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> and nothing would serve his turn, but he must put his Brother <HI>Roderic</HI> in Prison, and secure him with Fetters, for no other account, than because he demand∣od his share of his Fathers Lands. It was the custom of <HI>Wales,</HI> as is said before, to make an equal division of the Father's Inheritance between all the Children; and therefore <HI>David</HI> had no colour of Reason or Pretence to deal so severely with his Brother; unless it were to verifie that Proverb; <HI>Might overcomes Right.</HI> But though Prince <HI>David</HI> might depend much upon his Af∣finity with the King of <HI>England;</HI> yet <HI>Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales</HI> gained his Favour and Countenance the more, by reason that he let slip no opportunity to fur∣ther the King's Interest and Affairs in <HI>Wales,</HI> and by that means was a very necessary and useful Instrument to keep under the <HI>Welch,</HI> and to promote the surer Settlement of the <HI>English</HI> in the Country. Not that he bore any Love or Affection to either King <HI>Henry</HI> or his Subjects; but because he was sufficiently reward∣ed for former Services, and was still in expectation of receiving more Favours at the King's hands, he was re∣solved to play the Politician so far, as to have regard to his own Interest, more than the Good of his native Country. And what did ingratiate him to King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> most of all, upon the Feast of S. <HI>James</HI> he brought all such Lords of <HI>South-Wales</HI> as were at Enmity with the King, to do him Homage at <HI>Glocester;</HI> namely, <HI>Cadwalhon ap Madawc</HI> of <HI>Melyenyth,</HI> his Cosin-Ger∣man; <HI>Eineon Clyt</HI> of <HI>Eluel,</HI> and <HI>Eineon ap Rhys</HI> of <HI>Gwer∣thrynion,</HI> his Sons in Law; <HI>Morgan ap Caradoc ap Ie∣styn</HI> of <HI>Glamorgan; Gruffydh ap Ifor ap Meiric</HI> of <HI>Sen∣gennyth,</HI> and <HI>Sitsylht ap Dyfnwal</HI> of <HI>Higher Gwent,</HI> all three his Brothers in Law, who had married his Si∣sters; together with <HI>Iorwerth ap Owen</HI> of <HI>Caerlheon.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> was so well pleased with this Stratagem of <HI>Rhys,</HI> that notwithstanding these Persons had been his implacable Enemies, he readily granted them their Pardon, and received them to Favour; and restored to <HI>Iorwerth ap Owen</HI> the Town and Castle of <HI>Caerlheon,</HI> which he had unjustly taken from him.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1175" UNIT="A.D."/> This Reconciliation betwixt King <HI>Henry</HI> and these <HI>Welch</HI> Lords, some of the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> took ad∣vantage of, and more particularly <HI>William de Bruce</HI> Lord of <HI>Brecnock,</HI> who having for a long time a great longing to <HI>Gwentland,</HI> could not bring about his De∣sign, by reason that <HI>Sitsylht ap Dyfnwal,</HI> the Person of greatest sway and Power in the Country, was an in∣veterate Enemy to all the <HI>English.</HI> But being now reconciled to the King, <HI>William de Bruce,</HI> under pre∣tence of congratulating this new Peace and Agreement betwixt the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welch,</HI> invited <HI>Sitsylht</HI> and <HI>Geffrey</HI> his Son, with several others of the Persons of chiefest note in <HI>Gwentland,</HI> to a Feast in his Castle of <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> which by composition he had lately re∣ceived from them. <HI>Sitsylht,</HI> with the rest, came ac∣cording to appointment, and without the least suspi∣cion of any treasonable Designs; but after they had been civilly entertained for some time, <HI>William Bruce</HI> to move a Quarrel against them, began at last to pro∣pound certain Articles to them, to be by them kept and performed; and among other unreasonable Con∣ditions, they were to swear, that none of them should at any time carry with them Bow or Sword.

But whilst these things passed in <HI>South-Wales, Rode∣ric, David</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI>'s Brother, made his escape by some means or other out of Prison, and fleeing to <HI>Anglesey,</HI> he was receiv'd and acknowledg'd by all the Country t'other side the River <HI>Conwey,</HI> for their Lord and Prince; which they were the more willing to do, by reason that they conceived an utter Abhorrence of Prince <HI>David,</HI> who contrary to all Rules of Equity, and almost Nature, had disinherit∣ed all his Brethren and Cosins; as boldly relying upon his Affinity and Relation to the King of <HI>England.</HI> But <HI>David</HI> perceiving the Storm to grow very violent, and that the Country did numerously flock and adhere to his Brother <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> thought it his best way to stay a while, till the Storm was abated; and so retired over the River <HI>Conwey</HI> Towards the end of this Year, <HI>Cadelh</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> and Brother to Lord <HI>Rhys,</HI> after a tedious fit of Sickness, and taken upon him the Monkish Order, departed this Life, whose Body was very honourably enterred at <HI>Stratflur.</HI></P>
<P>In the Spring of the following Year, dyed also <HI>Da∣vid <MILESTONE N="1176" UNIT="A.D."/> Fitz Gerald</HI> Bishop of <HI>Menevia,</HI> or S. <HI>Davids,</HI> whose See was supplyed by one <HI>Piers,</HI> being nominat∣ed thereunto by the King of <HI>England.</HI> But what hap∣pened most remarkable this Year; the Lord <HI>Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South Wales</HI> made a very great Feast at <HI>Christmas</HI> in his Castle of <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> which he caused to be pro∣claimed through all <HI>Britain, Ireland,</HI> and the Islands adjacent, some considerable time before; and accor∣ding to their Invitation, many Hundreds of <HI>English, Normans,</HI> and others coming to <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> were very honourably received, and courteously entertained by Prince <HI>Rhys.</HI> But among other tokens of their Wel∣come and Entertainment, <HI>Rhys</HI> caused all the Bards or Poets throughout all <HI>Wales</HI> to come thither; and for a better Diversion to the Company, he provided Chairs to be set in the Hall, in which the Bards being seated, they were to answer each other in Rhyme; and those
<PB N="206" REF="140"/> that acquitted themselves most handsomly, and over∣came the rest, were promised great Rewards and rich Presents. In this poetical Disceptation, the <HI>North-Wales</HI> Bards obtained the Victory, with the Applause and Approbation of the whole Company; and among the Professors of Musick, between whom there was <MILESTONE N="1177" UNIT="A.D."/> no small Strife, Prince <HI>Rhys</HI>'s own Servants were ac∣counted the most expert. But for all this civil and obliging Treatment of Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> the <HI>Normans</HI> upon the Marches fell to their accustomed manner of trea∣cherous way-laying, and privately assaulting the harm∣less and undesigning <HI>Welch;</HI> and therefore <HI>Eineon Clyt Rhys</HI> his Son in Law, and <HI>Morgan ap Meredith,</HI> falling into the Net which the <HI>Normans</HI> had deceitfully laid for them, were treacherously murthered. Therefore to keep the <HI>Normans</HI> under greater fear and awe for the future, Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> built a Castle at <HI>Rhayadr Gwy,</HI> being a place where the River <HI>Wye</HI> falls with a very great Noise and Precipitation down a great Rock. <MILESTONE N="1178" UNIT="A.D."/> But this Castle was like to stand him in a double stead; for it was not long after he had perfectly finished it, that the Sons of <HI>Conan ap Owen Gwynedh</HI> made War against him; but finding upon tryal that their Design against <HI>Rhys</HI> was impracticable, they thought it more advisable to retire back to <HI>North-Wales.</HI></P>

This Year the Sepulchre of that famous and noble <HI>British</HI> King <HI>Ar∣thur,</HI> with his Wife <HI>Gwenhofar</HI> (by the means of some <HI>Welch</HI> Bard, whom King <HI>Henry</HI> had heard at <HI>Pembrock</HI> relate in a Song the worthy and mighty Acts of that great Prince, and the place where he was buried) was found in the Isle of <HI>Afalon,</HI> without the Abbey of <HI>Glastenbury;</HI> their Bodies being laid in a hollow El∣der Tree, buried Fifteen Foot in the Earth. The Bones of King <HI>Arthur</HI> were of marvelous and almost
<PB N="207" REF="140"/> incredible bigness, having ten Wounds in the Skull, whereof one being considerably larger than the rest, seemed to be his Death-Blow; and the Queens Hair seemed to the sight to be fair and yellow, but when touch'd, crumbled presently to Dust. Over the Bones was laid a Stone, with a Cross of Lead, upon the lower side of which Stone were engraven these words:

<P><HI>Here lies buried the famous King</HI> ARTHUR <HI>in the Isle of</HI> Afalon.</P></Q></P>
<P>No Action of moment had passed in <HI>Wales</HI> this long time, and the <HI>Welch</HI> were in perfect Amity and Concord with the King of <HI>England;</HI> but some un∣lucky Accident fell out at last to dissolve this happy <MILESTONE N="1182" UNIT="A.D."/> Union and Agreement. One <HI>Ranulph de Poer,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> or rather as <HI>Giraldus Cambren∣sis</HI> observes, of <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> being a cruel and unrea∣sonable Oppressor of the <HI>Welch,</HI> put the Lord of <HI>Gwentland</HI> to death; in revenge of whom, a certain young Person of that Country, set upon <HI>Ranulph</HI> with several other Gentlemen his Companions, and slew them to a Man. King <HI>Henry</HI> was implacably enrag'd at this News, and so cruelly incensed, that he pre∣sently raised and drew together all his Power, and came to <HI>Worcester,</HI> intending to march forward to <HI>Wales,</HI> and to invade the Enemies Country. But the Lord <HI>Rhys ap Gruffydh,</HI> a subtile and a politick Prince, thinking it impossible to withstand the <HI>English</HI> Army, and fearing the King's Puissance, which he perceived to be so implacably bent against the <HI>Welch,</HI> went in person to <HI>Worcester,</HI> and swearing Fealty to the King, became his perpetual Liege-Man; and for the due ob∣servance of this Contract, he promised to send his Sons and Nephews for Pledges. But when he would have persuaded them to answer his request, the young Men considering with themselves, how former Pledges had not been very genteely treated by the <HI>English,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="141"/> refused to go; and so the whole matter rested for that time. What became of the matter afterwards we know not; but probable it is, that King <HI>Henry</HI> re∣turned to <HI>England</HI> satisfied with <HI>Rhys</HI>'s Submission; for we hear no more of his coming to <HI>Wales.</HI> And so the Country remained quiet and undisturbed for a long time; till at length the <HI>Welch</HI> began to fall to their wonted Method of killing and murdering one another. <MILESTONE N="1186" UNIT="A.D."/><HI>Cadwalader</HI> Prince <HI>Rhys</HI>'s Son was privately murdered in <HI>West-Wales,</HI> and buried in the <HI>Ty Gwyn.</HI> And the Year following, <HI>Owen Fychan</HI> the Son of <HI>Madawe <MILESTONE N="1187" UNIT="A.D."/> ap Meredith,</HI> was slain by night in the Castle of <HI>Car∣rergova</HI> near <HI>Oswestry,</HI> by <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> and <HI>Cadwalhon</HI> the Sons of <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc.</HI> But what was most unna∣tural of all, <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> whose Father <HI>Cadwalhon ap Gruf∣fydh ap Conan</HI> was lately murdered by the <HI>Englishmen,</HI> was taken by his own Brothers, who very barbarously put out his Eyes. About the same time, <HI>Baldwyn,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> being attended by <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis,</HI> took a Progress into <HI>Wales,</HI> being the first Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> that visited that Country; whose Authority the Clergy of <HI>Wales</HI> in vain opposed, though they stifly alledged the Liberties and Privi∣ledges of their Metropolitan Church of S. <HI>Davids.</HI> In this Visitation, described by <HI>Giraldus</HI> in his <HI>Itinerarium Cambriae,</HI> he persuaded many of the Nobility of <HI>Wales</HI> to go to the <HI>Holy Land</HI> against those prevailing Enemies of Christianity, the <HI>Saracens;</HI> to whose prevailing Greatness, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> it self was now in great danger <MILESTONE N="1188" UNIT="A.D."/> to become subject. The Archbishop having left the Country, <HI>Maelgon</HI> the Son of Lord <HI>Rhys</HI> brought all his Power against <HI>Tenbigh,</HI> and having by force made himself Master of it, burnt the whole Town to the ground, and so carried away very considerable Spoil. He was a Person of such civil Behaviour and easie Ac∣cess, of so comly Personage, and Honesty in all his Actions, that he attracted the most earnest Love and Affection of all his Friends; by which means he be∣came very terrible and formidable to his Enemies, es∣pecially the <HI>Flemings,</HI> of whom he obtained divers Victories and Conquests.</P>

<P>The next Year, being the Year of Christ 1189.<MILESTONE N="1189" UNIT="A.D."/> <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, surnamed <HI>Courtmantel,</HI> King of <HI>England</HI> dyed, and was buried at <HI>Fonteverard;</HI> after whom, his Son <HI>Richard,</HI> called <HI>Curdelyon,</HI> was by the unanimous consent of all the Peers and Nobility of <HI>England,</HI> crowned in his place. Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> being thus deprived of his greatest Friend, thought it his wisest way to make the best provision he could for himself, by enlarging his Dominions, and extending the Bounds of his present Territories; and therefore having raised all the Strength he could, he wan the Castles of <HI>Seynclere, Abercorran,</HI> and <HI>Lhanstephan;</HI> and having taken and committed to Prison <HI>Maelgwn</HI> his Son, who was the greatest Thorn in his Side, as one that was most passionately beloved by the <HI>South-Wales</HI> Men, he brought the whole Country to his sub∣jection. Then he built the Castle of <HI>Cydwely;</HI> but <MILESTONE N="1190" UNIT="A.D."/> what took away from him the Joy of all this good For∣tune, he lost his Daughter <HI>Gwenlhian,</HI> a Woman of such incomparable Beauty, and exceeding in all femi∣nine Qualifications, that she was accounted the fairest and best accomplished Lady in all the Country.

His Father Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> was not so troubled at his being broke out, and that he had got his liberty, as to give over the Conquest, which all this while he had gone so furiously on with; but laying siege to <HI>Lhanhayaden</HI> Castle, he took it with∣out any great Opposition, and brought all the Coun∣try about to his subjection. And what favoured him more in his Attempts against the <HI>English,</HI> King <HI>Richard</HI> <MILESTONE N="1193" UNIT="A.D."/> having most bravely signalized himself against the Infi∣dels, in his return home through <HI>Austria,</HI> was taken Prisoner by Duke <HI>Leopold,</HI> who presented him to the Emperour <HI>Henry,</HI> who demanded 200000 Marks for his Ransom; laying to his charge, that he had spoil∣ed and plundered the Island of <HI>Sicily</HI> in his Voyage to the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> And as <HI>Rhys</HI> took the advantage of King <HI>Richard</HI>'s absence to subject <HI>South-Wales;</HI> so <HI>Ro∣deric</HI> Brother to <HI>David</HI> Prince of <HI>North Wales,</HI> made use of <HI>Gothrike</HI>'s the King of <HI>Man</HI>'s help, to get the Principality of <HI>North-Wales</HI> to himself, and eject his Brother. And therefore entring into <HI>Angl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sey,</HI> he quickly reduced the whole Island to his subjection. But he did not enjoy it long; for before the Year was over, the Sons of his Brother <HI>Conan</HI> came with an Ar∣my against him, and forcing him, together with the King of <HI>Man</HI> to fly the Island, they took present Pos∣session of it themselves. And while these things were done in <HI>North Wales, Maelgon,</HI> Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> of <HI>South-Wales</HI> his Son, who was lately escaped from Prison, besieged <HI>Ystratmeyric</HI> Castle, and after some small Oppo∣sition,
<PB N="211" REF="142"/> got it into his own hands upon <HI>Christmas</HI> night; which encouraged him to farther Attempts. And at the same time, his Brother <HI>Howel,</HI> surnamed <HI>Says,</HI> or the <HI>Englishman,</HI> by reason that he had served for some time under the King of <HI>England,</HI> another Son of Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> got by surprize the Castle of <HI>Gwys,</HI> and having secured <HI>Philip de Gwys</HI> the Owner, with his Wife and two Sons, he made them all Prisoners of War. Then the two Brothers <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>Maelgon</HI> joyned their For∣ces; but fearing that they had more Castles than what they were able to defend, they thought it convenient to rase <HI>Lhanhayaden</HI> Castle; which the <HI>Flemings</HI> ha∣ving notice of, they gathered all their Power together, and coming to <HI>Lhanhayaden</HI> at the day appointed, they unexpectedly set upon the <HI>Welch,</HI> and slew a great number of them. But notwitstanding this sudden and unhappy accident, they thought it necessary to de∣stroy the Castle; and so coming to <HI>Lhanhayaden</HI> the second time, they rased it to the ground, without any Molestation from, or appearance of any Enemy to di∣sturb them. But when <HI>Anarawd,</HI> another Son of Pr <HI>Rhys,</HI> saw how prosperously his Brothers succeed∣ed, he thought to make himself as rich as they, and by a shorter and an easier Method: And therefore ha∣ving under a smooth pretence of Friendship and Love got his Brothers <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>Madawc</HI> in private; being moved with Ambition and Covetousness to enjoy their Estates, he first made them Prisoners, and then very unnaturally pulled out their Eyes. But <HI>Maelgon</HI> esca∣ped this Snare, and hearing what a foul Action was committed, he promised his Brother <HI>Anarawd</HI> the Ca∣stle of <HI>Ystratmeyric,</HI> for the Liberty and Releasment of his two Brothers, which <HI>Anarawd</HI> granted. But 'tis <MILESTONE N="1194" UNIT="A.D."/> no wonder that those Brothers could be unnatural and cruel to one another, who could joyn and agree to re∣bel against their Father; and now Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> having rebuilt the Castle of <HI>Rhayadr Gwy,</HI> was laid wait for, and taken Prisoner by his own Sons, who were afraid, that in case their Father had them once in his power, he would severely revenge their cruel and unnatural Deed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But <HI>Howel</HI> proved more kind and dutiful than

<P>But whilst these unhappy Differences, and unna∣tural Clashings betwixt Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> and his Sons, continue and rage in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> a new revolution of Affairs happened in <HI>North-Wales.</HI> Prince <HI>David</HI> had now enjoyed the Sceptre of <HI>North-Wales</HI> for above Twenty Four Years; and one would think, that so long a Possession would secure him in his Throne, that it could not be very easie to pull him down. But Possession is not always the surest Card, which proved very true in Prince <HI>David</HI>'s case at this time; for <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> the Son of <HI>Iorwerth Drwyndwn,</HI> who was the eldest Son of <HI>Owen Gwynedh</HI> Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> being now arrived to Years of maturity, and having Sense enough to understand what a just Title and Claim he had to the Principality of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> of which his Uncle <HI>David</HI> had so unjustly kept him out; he thought it high time to endeavour to recover what was lawfully his own, which howe∣ver he was well persuaded his Uncle <HI>David</HI> would never easily part with. And therefore being well assured that the justness of his Title would never mount him up to the Throne, without he had an Army at his heels to help him on; he called toge∣ther all his Friends and Relations by his Mothers side, who was <HI>Marred</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Madawc ap Meredith</HI> Prince of <HI>Powys,</HI> and having drawn to his side his Cosins the Sons of <HI>Conan ap Owen Gwynedh▪</HI> and <HI>Rhodri ap Owen,</HI> he came into <HI>North Wa es,</HI> proclaiming how against all Justice his Uncle <HI>David</HI> had first disinherited his Father <HI>Iorwerth,</HI> and then
<PB N="213" REF="143"/> had kept the Government from him who was the right Heir. And though his Father <HI>Iorwerth</HI> had been incapable of taking upon him the Government by reason of some Infirmity; yet there was no rea∣son that his Fathers Weakness should exclude and turn him out; and therefore, being now sensible of what he was not capable to understand in his youth, he laid claim to the Principality, which was justly his own. But there was no great need of conjur∣ing to understand his Claim, nor of much Rhetorick to persuade the People to own him for their Prince; whose Affection was cooled, and almost worn off from <HI>David,</HI> ever since he had dealt so unnatural∣ly with his Brothers, whom after he had deprived of their Estates, he banished out of the Country. And therefore before <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> could expect to have any sure footing, the whole Country of <HI>North-Wales</HI> was at his devotion, excepting only Three Castles, which <HI>David,</HI> by the help of the <HI>English,</HI> in whom, by reason of his Affinity with the late King <HI>Henry,</HI> he depended much upon, kept to himself. And thus <HI>David</HI> being deprived of almost all that he for∣merly possessed; we shall reckon him no more a∣mong the Princes of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> but restore the Principality to the true Heir <HI>Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth.</HI></P>

<P><HI>LHewelyn ap Iorwerth</HI> the Son of <HI>Owen Gwynedh,</HI> having thus successfully carried on his just Claim to the Dominion of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and being quietly settled in the Government of it, <HI>Roger Mor∣timer</HI><MILESTONE N="1195" UNIT="A.D."/> marches with a strong Body to <HI>Melyenith,</HI> and built the Castle of <HI>Cymaron,</HI> whereby he re∣duced that Country to his subjection, and forced thence the two Sons of <HI>Cadwalh n ap Madawc</HI> that were Governours thereof. About this time <HI>Rhys</HI> and
<PB N="214" REF="144"/> <HI>Meredith</HI> (two valiant but undutiful) Sons of Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> having got together a Body of hot headed da∣ring Soldiers, came before <HI>Dynefawr,</HI> and took the Castle that was garrison'd by their Fathers Men: Hence they proceeded to <HI>Cantre-Fychan,</HI> where the Country civily received them, and surrender'd up the Castle to them. At this their Father was justly incensed, and therefore to put a stop to their far∣ther Proceedings, he endeavoured by all means to take them, which not long after happened; for their Adherents now began to be touched with the Sense as well of their Treason against, as of their Allegi∣ance due to their lawful Lord Prince <HI>Rhys;</HI> and therefore to attone for their past Faults, and to pro∣cure his future Favour, they betrayed their rebellious Leaders to their offended Father, who immediatly committed them to safe custody.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1196" UNIT="A.D."/> The ensuing Year Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> levies a great Army, whose first Attempt was upon the Town and Castle of <HI>Caermadthyn,</HI> both which he took in a short time and destroyed, and then returned with considerable Booty. Not long after he led the said Army to the Marches, and invested the Castle of <HI>Clun,</HI> which was not so easily taken as the former; for this cost him a long Siege, and many a fierce Assault; and therefore to be revenged of it, when he took it he laid it in Ashes; thence he proceeded to the Ca∣stle of <HI>Radnor,</HI> which he likewise wan; but imme∣diately after it cost him a bloody Battel; for he was no sooner Master of the Castle, but <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> and <HI>Hugh de Say</HI> came with a numerous and well-disciplin'd Army, consisting of <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> to the relief of it. Whereupon Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> thinking it not his best course to confine his Men within the Walls, led 'em up into a Champion Ground hard by, and there, like a valiant Prince, resolved to give his Enemies Battel, though they had much the advantage of him; for his Men were nei∣ther so well armed, nor so much accustomed to Bat∣tel as the others were; however their Courage made amends for their Arms, and their Leaders Prudence
<PB N="215" REF="144"/> and Conduct supply'd the Defects of their Disci∣pline; for they chose rather to die honourably in the Defence of their Country than shamefully to sur∣vive the Loss of it; and therefore they attack'd their Enemies so valiantly, that they were not long able to withstand their Force, but quitted the Field in great Disorder, leaving a great number of their Men behind them slain upon the spot: and Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> pursued them so warmly, that they were glad of the shelter of the Night to protect them from his Fury. After this Victory, he besieged the Castle of <HI>Payne</HI> in <HI>Elfel,</HI> which he easily took, and kept in his own hands, till <HI>William de Bruce,</HI> the Owner there∣of, came to him, and humbly desired Peace of him, which he granted him, and withal deliver'd him up his Castle again. Not long after, the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> (whom King <HI>Richard</HI> had substituted his Lieutenant in <HI>England</HI>) marches with a powerful Army towards <HI>Wales,</HI> and besieges the Castle of <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> at the Pool; but the Garrison made such a vigorous Defence, that he lost a great many of his Men, and all his A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>empts proved ineffectual; therefore he sent for some Pyoneers, whom he or∣dered to undermine the Walls; which when the besieged understood, they bethought of securing themselves on the most honourable Terms they could; they were not willing to put themselves to the ha∣zard of a Battel, for their Enemies were thrice their Number; therefore they proposed to surrender up the Castle, on condition they should carry off all their Arms along with them: Which Offer the Archbi∣shop accepted of, and so permitted the Garrison to march out quietly. Then fortifying the Castle for the King's use, and putting a strong Garrison in it for its defence, he returned again to <HI>England.</HI> But <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> was not so willing to part from his Ca∣stle, as never to attempt the Recovery of it; there∣fore as soon as he understood that the Archbishop was gone back, he immediately besieged it, and shortly after received it on the same Terms that his Men had deliver'd it up, and afterwards kept it for his own use.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="145"/>
<P><MILESTONE N="1197" UNIT="A.D."/> The following Year there broke out a terrible Plague, which spread over all <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and carried off a great number of the Nobility, be∣sides common People. This Year likewise dyed the valiant <HI>Rhys,</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> the only Stay and Defence of that part of <HI>Wales;</HI> for he it was that got them their Liberty, and secured it to them. He often very readily exposed his own Life for the defence of theirs and their Country; generally he got the better of his Enemies, and at last either brought them entirely under his Subjection, or for∣ced them to quit their Country. He was no less illustrious for his virtuous Endowments, than for his Valour and Extraction; so that it was with good reason that the <HI>British</HI> Bards and others wrote so honourably of him, and so mightily deplored his Death.</P>
<P>To this Prince were born many Sons and Daugh∣ters, whereof his elder Son <HI>Gruffydh</HI> succeeded him; the others were <HI>Cadwalhon, Maelgon, Meredith,</HI> and <HI>Rhys.</HI> Of his Daughters, one called <HI>Gwenthtan</HI> was married to <HI>Ednyfed Fycha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Ancestor to <HI>Owen Tudor</HI> that married <HI>Kitharine</HI> Queen-Dowager to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth: And the rest were very well match'd with some of the Nobility of the Country. Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> being settled in the Government of his Country, did not long enjoy it peaceably; for his troublesom Brother <HI>Maelgon</HI> thought it now a fit time to endeavour the recovery of the Inheritance his Father had deprived him of. To this purpose he makes a League with <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> the Son of <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc,</HI> Lord of <HI>Powys,</HI> and by their joynt Interest got together a considerable Body of Men, where∣with they surprized Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> at <HI>Aberystwyth,</HI> whom, after they had slain a great many of his Men, they took Prisoner. Thus <HI>Maelgon</HI> effectually ac∣complished his Design in the recovery of the Castle, and the whole Country of <HI>Cardigan.</HI> His unfortu∣nate Brother he committed to the custody of his spite∣ful Confederate <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> who immediately out of Malice deliver'd him up to the Mercy of his in∣veterate
<PB N="217" REF="145"/> Enemies the <HI>English.</HI> After this <HI>Gwenwyn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yn</HI> having got together an Army entered <HI>Arustly,</HI> and brought it to his subjection.</P>
<P><HI>David ap Owen,</HI> whom Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> had for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to quit his Usurpation of the Principality of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> had hitherto lived quietly and peacea∣bly, not so much out of kindness to his Nephew, as because he knew not how to redress himself; but now having got a great Army of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welch,</HI> he used his utmost Efforts to recover his Principality. Whereupon Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> who was the right Heir, and in possession of it, came on boldly to meet him, and gave him battel, wherein he shamefully routed his Army, and took his Uncle <HI>David</HI> Prisoner, whom he delivered into safe custody, whereby he secured to himself and his Country Peace and Quietness. Towards the close of this Year <HI>Owen Cyfeilioc</HI> Lord of the higher <HI>Powys</HI> departed this Life, and left his Estate to <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> his Son; after whom that part of <HI>Powys</HI> was called <HI>Powys-Wenwynwyn,</HI> to distinguish it from the other called <HI>Powys Fadoc</HI> the Inheritance of the Lords of <HI>Bromfield.</HI> Much about this time <HI>Trahaern Fychan,</HI> a Man of great Power and Autho∣rity in the County of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> was suddenly seized upon as he was going to <HI>Llancors</HI> to confer about some business with <HI>William de Bruce</HI> Lord thereof, and by an Order of the Lords, tyed to an Horse Tail and dragged through the Streets of <HI>Brecknock</HI> to the Gal∣lows, where he was beheaded, and his Body hung up by the Feet for three Days. Which Barbarity in∣flicted upon him for no known just Cause, so fright∣ned his Brothers Wife and Children, that they fled their Country for fear of the same Usage. The <MILESTONE N="1198" UNIT="A.D."/> Year following <HI>Maelgon,</HI> who had before routed his Brother Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI>'s Army, and taken him Pri∣soner, begins now to enlarge his Territories, and takes in his Brothers Castles of <HI>Aberteifi</HI> and <HI>Ystratmeyric.</HI> Also the youngest Son of Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> about this time recovered the Castle of <HI>Dynefowr</HI> from the <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<PB N="218" REF="146"/>
<P>The same Summer <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> took up a resolution of attempting to extend <HI>Wales</HI> to its antient Limits; and for this purpose he raises a powerful Army, with which he first designs to be avenged of <HI>William de Bruce</HI> for the inhuman Death of his Cosin <HI>Trahaern Fychan,</HI> and therefore he besiegeth his Castle of <HI>Payn</HI> in <HI>Elfel,</HI> where he makes a Protestation, that as soon as he had taken it, for a farther satisfaction to his Re∣venge, he would unmercifully ravage the whole Coun∣try as far as <HI>Severn.</HI> But these mighty Menaces were soon blown over; for he had neither Battering En∣gins nor Pioneers, so that he was forced to lay before the Castle for three Weeks without effecting any thing; whereby the Murtherers had time enough to apply themselves to <HI>England</HI> for Succours, which they obtained. For upon this <HI>Geoffrey Fitz-Peter,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England</HI> levies a considerable Army, to which he joyns all the Lords Marchers, and comes in all hast to the Relief of the place, where he meets <HI>Gwenwynwyn;</HI> with whom, before he would hazard a Battel, he was desirous to have a Treaty of Peace, to which <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> and his Adherents would in no wise hearken or condescend, but returned in answer, that their business there was to be revenged of old In∣juries done them. Hereupon the <HI>English</HI> Lords resol∣ved to enlarge Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> whom they knew to be an inveterate Enemy of <HI>Gwenwyn∣wyn,</HI> as he that delivered him up to their hands; and likewise to be a Man of great Authority in his Coun∣try, therefore they rightly concluded he might be more serviceable to them when at liberty than under confinement, wherein they were not disappointed; for he immediately got together a strong Body of his Countrymen, and joyning with the <HI>English,</HI> ad∣vanced towards the Castle, where they furiously at∣tack'd <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> who made no less vigorous de∣fence; hereupon there ensued a bloody Battel, with a great slaughter on both sides, but at length the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> got the Victory, and <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> lost a great number of common Soldiers (if we believe <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> 3700 Men) besides a great many of his best
<PB N="219" REF="146"/> Commanders, among whom were <HI>Anarawd,</HI> Son of <HI>Eineon, Owen ap Cadwalhon, Richard ap Iestyn,</HI> and <HI>Robert ap Howel. Meredith ap Conan</HI> was likewise taken Prisoner, with many more. After this the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> returned home triumphantly, and requited Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI>'s Service with a perfect Liberty, who imme∣diately, partly by his own Force, partly by the Af∣fection of his People, repossessed himself of all his Dominions, save the Castles of <HI>Aberteifi</HI> and <HI>Ystratmey∣rie,</HI> which his usurping Brother <HI>Maelgon,</HI> by the As∣sistance of <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> had, during his Confinement by the <HI>English,</HI> taken from him, and still unjustly de∣tained. Hereupon, some of Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI>'s prime Nobility and Clergy came to him, and offered him their Endeavours of reconciling him to his Brother, and made him so apprehensive of his just Displeasure at him, that he took a solemn Oath before them, that in case his Brother would give him Hostages for the security of his own Person, he would deliver him up his Castle of <HI>Aberteifi</HI> by a day appointed; which Proposals Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> accepted of, and accordingly sent him his Demands: But it was the least of <HI>Mael∣gon</HI>'s intention to make good his part, or else he was very unconstant in his resolution; for he had no sooner received the Hostages, but instead of delivering up the Castle, he fortifies it, and puts in a Garrison for his own use, and commits the Hostages to the cu∣stody of <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI>'s mortal Ene∣my; but not long after, their Innocency procured them an opportunity of an Escape.</P>
<P>In the Year 1199 <HI>Maelgon</HI> still pursuing his Ha∣tred <MILESTONE N="1199" UNIT="A.D."/> of his Brother Prince <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> gets an Army, wherewith he besiegeth his Castle of <HI>Dynerth,</HI> which he was Master of in a short time, and then put all the Garrison to the Sword. But about the same time Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> in lieu of this, wan the Castle of <HI>Cilgerran,</HI> and strongly fortified it. This Year <HI>Richard</HI> the First of <HI>England,</HI> as he was besieging the Castle of <HI>Chalons</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> was shot from the Walls with an Arrow, whereof he not long after dyed, and left his Kingdom to his Brother <HI>John,</HI> who thereupon was
<PB N="220" REF="147"/> with great Solemnity crown'd at <HI>Westminster.</HI> But he could not expect to enjoy this Kingdom peace∣ably; for his elder Brother <HI>Geoffry Plantagenet</HI> had left a Son behind him named <HI>Arthur,</HI> whose Right the Crown of <HI>England</HI> was by lineal descent; which now therefore he justly lays claim to, and by the assistance of King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>France</HI> (who espoused his Quarrel) endeavours to recover. But before Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> had made sufficient Preparations to car∣ry on his Design, he was unexpectedly set upon by his Uncle, his Army routed, and he himself taken Pri∣soner, and committed to safe custody; not long after which, he dyed, and so King <HI>John</HI> was rid of his Competitor.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1200" UNIT="A.D."/> The following Year <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan ap Owen Gwynedh</HI> dyed, and was buried in a Monk's Cawl in the Abby of <HI>Conway,</HI> which way of burying was ve∣ry much practised (especially by the better sort) in those days; for the Monks and Friers had deluded the People into a strong Conceit of the Merits of it, and had firmly persuaded them it was highly condu∣cing to their future Happiness to be thus interr'd. But this Superstition, together with the Propagators of it, they had lately received from <HI>England:</HI> For the first Abby or Monastery we read of in <HI>Wales,</HI> since the Destruction of that famous House of <HI>Bangor,</HI> which favour'd of <HI>Romish</HI> Dregs, was the <HI>Ty-Gwyn</HI> built in the Year 1146. after which they mightily increased and spread over all the Country; and now the Foun∣tain Head began to be corrupted; for the Clergy maintained a Doctrin which their Ancestors abhorr'd, as may easily be gathered from the Writings of that worthy Divine <HI>Ambrosius Telesinus,</HI> who flourished in the Year 540. when the Christian Faith (which we suppose to be deliver'd at the Isle of <HI>Afalon</HI> by <HI>Jo∣seph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI>) flowed in this Land in a pure and uncorrupted Stream, before it was infected and polluted by that proud and blood-thirsty Monk <HI>Au∣gustine.</HI> I say, he then wrote and left behind him as his own Opinion, and the Opinion of those days these following Verses:
<Q><PB N="221" REF="147"/>
<L>Gwae'r offeiriad byd</L>

<L>Rhae bleidhie Rhufeniaid</L>
<L>A'i ffon gnwppa.</L></Q></P>
<P>From whence it is apparent, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was then corrupt, and that the <HI>British</HI> Chur∣ches persevered in the primitive and truly Apostolical Profession of Christianity, as it was at first planted in the Island; and that no <HI>Roman</HI> Innovations had crept in among them, which afterwards mightily increased, when they were once introduced by <HI>Augustin</HI> the Monk.</P>
<P>This Year likewise we find the spiteful and turbu∣lent <HI>Maelgon,</HI> choosing rather to persist still in his Re∣bellion, than to return to his Allegiance, and to prefer a small Lucre to the Love and Safety of his Country. For now finding that the Castle of <HI>Aberteifi</HI> was not tenable by his own Power and Force, yet rather than deliver it up to his Brother Prince <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> and there∣by procure his Favour, he chose to sell it to his bitter Enemies the <HI>English,</HI> for an inconsiderable Sum of Money, whereby he opened them a free passage into all <HI>Wales;</HI> this being reckoned one of its chief De∣fences and Bulwarks. About this time <HI>Madawc</HI> Son of <HI>Gruffydh Maylor</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield</HI> built the Abby of <HI>Lanegwest,</HI> commonly known by the <HI>English</HI> by the Name of <HI>Vale Crucii.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1201. the valiant <HI>Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth</HI><MILESTONE N="1201" UNIT="A.D."/> Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> banished out of his Territories his Cosin <HI>Meredith</HI> the Son of <HI>Conan ap Owen Gwynedh,</HI> whom he suspected of treasonable Practices, and there∣fore confiscated his Lands which were the <HI>Cantref</HI> of <HI>Lhyn</HI> and <HI>Efyonyth.</HI> Much about the same time <HI>Me∣redith</HI> the Son of Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> was slain at <HI>Car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wilhion</HI> by Treason, whereupon his elder Brother <HI>Gruffydh</HI> possessed himself of his Castle in <HI>Lhanymdhyfri</HI> and all his Lands. This <HI>Gruffydh</HI> was a valiant and dis∣creet Prince, and one that was like to bring all <HI>South-Wales</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="148"/> to good order and Obedience; for in all things he trod in his Fathers steps, and made it his business to succeed him as well in his Valour and vertuous En∣dowments, as in his Government. But the vast hopes conceived of him soon proved abortive; for in the en∣suing <MILESTONE N="1202" UNIT="A.D."/> Year, on S. <HI>James</HI>'s day he dyed, to the great Grief and Loss of his Country, and shortly after was buried at <HI>Ystratflur</HI> with great Pomp and Solemnity. He left behind him for a Successor a Son called <HI>Rhys,</HI> which <HI>Maud</HI> the Daughter of <HI>William de Bruce</HI> had bore him. The following Year some of the <HI>Welch</HI> Nobility marched with an Army towards the Castle of <HI>Gwerthrynion,</HI> which belonged to <HI>Roger Mortimer,</HI> and after a short Siege, they took it and levell'd it with the ground.</P>
<P>This Year <HI>Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth</HI> calling to mind his Estate and Title, and how all the <HI>Welch</HI> Princes were obliged both by the Laws of <HI>Roderic</HI> the Great, and those of <HI>Howel Dha</HI> to acknowledg the King or Prince of <HI>North-Wales</HI> for their Sovereign Lord, and to do Homage to him for their Dominions: Yet not∣withstanding that they knew this to be their duty, and that they formerly had readily performed it; yet because of late Years his Predecessors had neglected to call them to their Duty, they now began to ima∣gin themselves exempted from it; and some thought themselves accountable to no superiour Prince; others denyed Subjection to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> and held their Dominions of the King of <HI>England.</HI> To put a stop therefore to the further growth of this Contempt, and to assert his own Right, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> summons all the <HI>Welch</HI> Lords, who for the most part appeared▪ and swore Allegiance to him. But <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> Lord of <HI>Powys</HI> neither came to this meeting, nor would own the Princes Supremacy: Which Stubborness and Disobedience the Prince acquainted his Lords with, whereupon they delivered their Opinion, that it was but reasonable, that <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> should be compell'd to his Duty, or else forfeit his Estate: This all the Lords consented to, but <HI>Elis ap Madawc,</HI> who was an intimate Friend of <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> and therefore
<PB N="223" REF="148"/> would not consent to the enacting any thing that might be prejudicial to him, but broke off from the Meeting much dissatisfied with their Proceedings. Notwithstanding which, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> pursuant to the Advice of the rest of his Lords, raises an Ar∣my, and marches towards <HI>Powys;</HI> but before he made any use of it, he was by the Mediation of some learn∣ed and able Men reconciled to <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> and so <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> became his dutiful Subject, which he confirmed both by Oath and Writing; and indeed it was not without good reason, that Prince <HI>Lhewe∣lyn</HI> used all the caution imaginable to bind this Man; for he had sworn Allegiance before to the King of <HI>England. Lhewelyn</HI> having thus subjected <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> he thought it now convenient to shew likewise some Marks of his Resentments against his Adherent <HI>Elis ap Madawc,</HI> and therefore he strips him of all his Lands; whereupon <HI>Elis</HI> fled the Country, but not long after, yielding himself to the Prince's Mercy, he received of him the Castle of <HI>Crogen,</HI> and Seven Town∣ships besides. And now having mentioned <HI>Crogen,</HI> it will not be improper to step a little out of the way, and here take notice of the reason why the <HI>English</HI> formerly, when they had a mind to reproach the <HI>Welch,</HI> called them <HI>Crogens.</HI> The first occasion of it was this, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second in his Expedition against the <HI>Welch</HI> to the Mountains of <HI>Berwin,</HI> lay a while at <HI>Os∣westre,</HI> during which time he detached a number of his Men to try the Passages into <HI>Wales,</HI> who as they would have passed <HI>Offa</HI>'s Ditch at the Castle of <HI>Crogen,</HI> at which place there was a narrow way through the same Ditch, which appears now very deep through all that Country, and bears its old Name; these Men, I say, as they would have passed this Streight, were met by a Party of <HI>Welch,</HI> and a great many of them strain and buried in that Ditch, as appears by their Graves there to be seen; and the Name of the Streight imports as much, being called in <HI>Welch Adwy'r bedhaw▪</HI> The <HI>English</HI> therefore bearing in mind this Slaughter, when ever they got any of the <HI>Welch</HI> into their Clutches, upbraided them with
<PB N="224" REF="149"/> the Name of <HI>Crogen,</HI> intimating thereby that they should expect no more Favour or Mercy at their hands, than they shew'd them in the Skirmish. But this word which at first was rather a Badg of Reputation than Disgrace to the <HI>Welch,</HI> came afterwards to be used in a bad Sense, and only then applyed when they designed to reproach and abuse them. But to return to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> whom we find returning home after he had successfully asserted his Sovereignty over all <HI>Wales,</HI> and set all things in good order: And by the way he fortifies the Castle of <HI>Bala</HI> in <HI>Penlhyn.</HI> About this time <HI>Rhys</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> the right Prince of <HI>South-Wales</HI> took the Castle of <HI>Lha∣nymdhyfry</HI> upon <HI>Michaelmas</HI>-day. This Year <HI>Lhewe∣lyn</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> took to Wife <HI>Joan</HI> the Daughter of King <HI>John,</HI> which <HI>Agatha</HI> Daughter of <HI>Robert Fer∣rers</HI> Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> bore him, with whom he gave the Prince for a Dowry the Lordship of <HI>Elsmere</HI> in the Marches of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1203" UNIT="A.D."/> Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> whom we mentioned the Year before to have taken the Castle of <HI>Lhanymdhyfri,</HI> wins like∣wise the Castle of <HI>Llangadoc,</HI> and puts a Garrison therein; but he enjoyed neither of them long; for shortly after, his Unkle <HI>Maelgon,</HI> with his Friend <HI>Gwenwynwyn,</HI> levied a powerful Army, and with it besieged and took the Castle of <HI>Lhanymdhyfri;</HI> thence they removed to <HI>Lhangadoc,</HI> and wan the Castle like∣wise, upon this Condition, that the Garrison be per∣mitted to march out quietly. When they had taken these two Castles, they went to <HI>Dinerth,</HI> where <HI>Mael∣gon</HI> finished the Castle he had formerly begun there. This Year likewise Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> set at liberty his Uncle <HI>David ap Owen Gwynedh,</HI> who made but a sorry return to this Kindness; for instead of living peaceably at home, and enjoying that Liberty that was granted him, he flees to <HI>England,</HI> and there gets an Army, wherewith he attempts to restore himself to his antient Estate of <HI>North-Wales;</HI> but he missed his Mark; for his prudent Nephew immediately met him on his March, and gave him a shameful Over-throw, wherewith <HI>David</HI> was so mightily disheartened, that
<PB N="225" REF="149"/> he presently returned for <HI>England,</HI> and shortly after died for meer sorrow. The next Year <HI>Howel,</HI> a blind <MILESTONE N="1204" UNIT="A.D."/> Son of Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> was slain at <HI>Camaes</HI> by his Bro∣ther <HI>Maelgon</HI>'s Men, and buried just by his Brother <HI>Gruffydh</HI> at <HI>Ystratflur.</HI> But notwithwanding that, <HI>Maelgon</HI> in those days usurped all the Rule and Go∣vernment of <HI>South-Wales;</HI> yet his Brother <HI>Gruffydh</HI>'s Sons, <HI>Rhys</HI> and his Brethren, wan from him the chief Defence of all that Country, to wit, the Castles of <HI>Dynefowr</HI> and <HI>Lhanymdhyfri.</HI> About this time <HI>William Marshal,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrock,</HI> besieged the Castle of <HI>Cilgerran,</HI> and took it; and not long after, <HI>Maelgon</HI><MILESTONE N="1205" UNIT="A.D."/> hired an <HI>Irishman</HI> to kill <HI>Gadifor ap Griffri;</HI> after which horrid Fact, <HI>Maelgon</HI> seized upon his Four Sons, and put them to death; these were forward promi∣sing young Gentlemen, and descended from a Noble Stock; for their Mother <HI>Susanna</HI> was a Daughter of the said <HI>Howel ap Rhys,</HI> by a Daughter of <HI>Madawc ap Meredith</HI> Prince of <HI>Powys.</HI> In the Year 1206. <HI>Ma∣elgon</HI><MILESTONE N="1206" UNIT="A.D."/> built a Castle at <HI>Abereneon.</HI> At which time there was such abundance of Fish seen at <HI>Aberystwyth,</HI> that the like number was never known to have come there in the memory of Man before.<MILESTONE N="1207" UNIT="A.D."/></P>
<P>This Year the King of <HI>England</HI> banished the Realm <HI>William de Bruce</HI> and his Wife, on the account of a Grudg that he bore his Son, and then seized upon all his Lands; whereupon, <HI>William</HI> with his Wife and Son fled to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and there continued for some time. And this Hardship he now underwent was the less pitied, because he exercised the great Power he had in the Marches of <HI>Wales</HI> with extreme Cruelty and Injustice. The same Year <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> came to <HI>Shrews∣bury</HI> to speak with the King's Council, where he was detained Prisoner: Whereupon Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> con∣quered all his Country, took all his Towns and Ca∣stles, and garrison'd them for his own use. This Ex∣pedition of Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> mightily alarm'd the usurping <HI>Maelgon,</HI> and the more, because he had in∣telligence that <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> was on his march towards <HI>South-Wales;</HI> therefore he now puts himself in the best posture he could to receive him; but finding
<PB N="226" REF="150"/> himself not able to abide the Prince's coming, and to withstand his Forces, he demolisheth his Castles of <HI>Aberystwyth, Ystratmeyric,</HI> and <HI>Dinerth,</HI> which before he had fortified. Notwithstanding which, the Prince comes to <HI>Aberystwyth,</HI> and rebuildeth the Castle and puts a Garrison therein; after this he seized upon the <HI>Cantref</HI> of <HI>Penwedic</HI> and the Land betwixt <HI>Dyfi</HI> and <HI>Aeron</HI> which he gave to <HI>Maelgon</HI>'s Nephews the Sons of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> and then returned home with great Joy and Triumph. Not long after <HI>Rhys Fychan,</HI> Son to Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> besieged the Castle of <HI>Lhangadoc,</HI> and took it, contrary to the Promise and League he had made with his Nephews, forgetting likewise how freely and readily they had administred to him in his necessity; therefore to be avenged of this Ingratitude and breach of promise, <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> no sooner heard of it, but they furiously attack'd the Castle, and took it by assault, and put to the Sword, or took Prisoners all the Garrison, and then burnt the Castle to the ground.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1209" UNIT="A.D."/> This Year King <HI>John</HI> levied a powerful Army with which he made a Voyage to <HI>Ireland;</HI> but as he was on the Borders of <HI>Wales</HI> on his Journey thitherwards, there was a Criminal brought before him who had murther'd a Priest. The Officer desired to know the King's Pleasure, how he would have the Delinquent punished; but the King, instead of ordering any Pu∣nishment to be inflicted upon him suitable to the hei∣nousness of his Crime, discharged him with a <HI>Well done</HI> thou good Servant, thou hast slain mine Enemy; for such he reckon'd the Clergy of those days who were very ill-affected to his usurped arbitrary Govern∣ment, and therefore he slightly regarded any Injuries that were done them, nay, thought those did him good service who did them wrong. He had not been long in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but he got into his clutches the unfortunate <HI>William de Bruce</HI> the younger, and his Mother <HI>Mawd de Saint Valerike,</HI> whom we have mentioned afore to have quitted <HI>England</HI> for fear of him, and to have fled here for shelter. Upon his return to <HI>England</HI> he brought these in triumph along with him, and com∣mitted
<PB N="227" REF="150"/> them to <HI>Windsor</HI>-Castle, where, by his Orders, not long after they were inhumanly famished. The reason of King <HI>John</HI>'s Displeasure against <HI>William de Bruce</HI> Lord of <HI>Brecnock,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 303.</NOTE> <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> delivers, to be this; When the Pope had excommunicated the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> the King, to prevent any Incon∣veniences that might ensue thereupon, took Pledges of such of his Nobles as he thought were disaffected to him, and would be like, if occasion offered, to countenance and promote a Rebellion. Amongst o∣thers, he sends Messengers to <HI>William de Bruce</HI> to de∣mand his Sons for Pledges, to whom <HI>Mawd, de Bruce</HI>'s Wife, being the readier speaker, answered, (though what she said was no less her Husband's Sentiment than her own) Thar the King, who had proved so base a Guardian to his Nephew Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> whom instead of setting in, he deprived of his Right, should have none of her Children. This Answer the Mes∣sengers deliver'd to the King, whereat he was highly displeased, that he ordered some Soldiers should be sent to seize this Lord, but he having timely intelli∣gence of this Order, fled into <HI>Ireland</HI> with his Wife and Children, where now his Wife <HI>Mawd,</HI> with her Son, were unfortunately taken by King <HI>John,</HI> but he himself escaped, and fled into <HI>France,</HI> where not long after he dyed.</P>
<P>This Year the Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> rebuilt the Castle of <HI>Dyganwy,</HI> situate on the Sea-shore, East of the River <HI>Conway,</HI> which Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> had before demolish∣ed. He likewise fortifies the Castle of <HI>Treffynon</HI> or S. <HI>Wenefrid.</HI> Upon this <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> enters into the Earl's Land, which when he had ravaged sufficiently, he returns home with considerable Booty. About this time <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> Son to Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> fearing lest Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> should fall upon him for the wrong he had done to his Nephews, whom he, Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn,</HI> stifly defended in their right; made his Appli∣cation to the King of <HI>England,</HI> who readily granted him what Succours he desired; and with these he besieged the Castle of <HI>Lhanymdhyfri;</HI> the Garrison for some time made a vigorous defence, but having
<PB N="228" REF="151"/> no hopes of any Relief, they thought it their wisest course to Capitulate, and so they desired they might march out with their Arms, Bag and Baggage, and all that belonged to them, which was granted them. About this time likewise <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> was set at Li∣berty, whom the King had hitherto detained Prisoner, and withal lends him some Forces to attempt the re∣covery of his Country which Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> had seized upon during his Imprisonment; and tho' by his own Strength he was not able to cope with the Prince, yet by this Assistance granted him by the King, he soon re-possess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself of his Dominions. This Success of <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> encouraged <HI>Maelgon</HI> like∣wise to endeavour the recovery of that part of his Country which the Prince had taken from him in the same Expedition. Now he makes his application to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and swears Allegiance to him. Hereupon the King grants him a considerable Army as well <HI>English</HI> as <HI>Normans;</HI> to these he joyns what Forces he could raise in <HI>Wales,</HI> and then contrary to the Oath and Agreement he had made with his Ne∣phews <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Owen,</HI> he in a hostile manner enters their Country, when he was come to <HI>Cantred Penwe∣dic,</HI> he encamped at <HI>Cilcenny</HI> where he staid some time to take measures for the better accomplishment of his Designs; by this time his Nephews had got together about 300 chosen well disciplined Men, but with so small a Number durst not oppose their Uncle's numerous Army in open Field; therefore they were to endeavour to overthrow those by a Stratagem which they could not do by main force. Herein they proved very successful, for coming as near their Ene∣mies as they could without being discovered, they sent out their Spies that Night for Intelligence, who brought back the good News, that all was quiet in <HI>Maelgon</HI>'s Camp, and that they kept no strict Watch, being not aware of an approaching Enemy. This Intelligence mightily encouraged the Brothers to pro∣secute their Designs, and now they march as si∣lently as they can towards their Enemies Camp, where they met with no opposition, being not dis∣covered
<PB N="229" REF="151"/> because all were fast asleep. When they were advanced as they thought as far as <HI>Maelgon</HI>'s Tent, they furiously fell on, and slew a great number of his Men afore they awak'd; the rest being frightened with the noise and shouts of their Enemies, and with∣al thinking their Numbers to be far greater than it was, were glad to make use of the darkness of the Night to quit the Field, only <HI>Maelgon</HI>'s Guard vali∣antly kept their Post, and defended their Lord till he had time and opportunity to escape. But <HI>Maelgon</HI>'s Army suffered very much in this Action, his Ne∣phew <HI>Conan ap Howel</HI> with his Chief Counsellor <HI>Gruf∣fydh ap Cadwgan</HI> were both taken Prisoners, and <HI>Eineon ap Caradoc</HI> with a great number more were slain upon the spot. About the same time <HI>Gilbert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> fortified the Castle of <HI>Buelht,</HI> where a little before he had lost a considerable number of his Men, by reason that the place was not very strong and tenable. And towards the conclusion of this year, <HI>Mallt</HI> or <HI>Mawd de Bruce,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> departed this Life, and was interred by her Husband in a Monk's Coul in <HI>Ystratflur.</HI></P>
<P>But the following Year a great Storm threatened <MILESTONE N="1210" UNIT="A.D."/> <HI>North-Wales,</HI> by reason that the <HI>Marchers</HI> made fre∣quent and grievous Complaints to King <HI>John,</HI> how that Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> perpetually molested their Coun∣try, slew their Men, and committed all the waste and destruction possible as he passed along. The King hearing of such intolerable Depredations continually exercised by the <HI>North-Wales</HI> Men, thought it high time to redress his Subjects, and therefore he raised a mighty Army throughout all <HI>England▪</HI> and called to him all the Lords and Princes of <HI>Wales</HI> as held their Lands and Patents from him, as <HI>Howel ap Gruf∣fydh ap Conan ap Owen Gwynedh,</HI> whom Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> had banished out of <HI>North-Wales; Madoc ap Gruffydh Maylor</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield, Chirke</HI> and <HI>Yale, Meredith ap Rotpert</HI> Lord of <HI>Cydewen, Gwenwynwyn</HI> Lord of <HI>Powys, Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Rhys</HI> the Sons of Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> and Governours of <HI>South Wales.</HI> With this for∣midable Army he came to <HI>Chester,</HI> intending to enter
<PB N="230" REF="152"/> into <HI>North-Wales</HI> by that way, and being fully re∣solved to execute the severest Vengeance upon the Inhabitants, and not to let one living Soul re∣main alive throughout the whole Country. But Matters of this nature are easier resolved upon, than accomplished; Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> was no sooner in∣formed of these mighty preparations against him, comprehending the whole Strength of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, and what was worst of all, being assisted by his own Country-men, but he issued forth his Or∣ders, commanding all his Subjects of the In-land Counties of <HI>Denbigh</HI> and <HI>Flint,</HI> together with them of the Island of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> to remove for a time all their Cattel and other Effects to <HI>Snowden</HI>-Hills, where they were sure to remain securest from their Enemies. But King <HI>John</HI> marched his Army along the Sea-Coast to <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> and there passing the River <HI>Clwyd,</HI> he came to the Castle of <HI>Teganwy,</HI> where he encamped for some time to refresh and recreate his Army, which by reason of the long Marches they made, was in a great measure weary and fatigued. But what the more augmented their misery, <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> getting behind them, cut off all their hopes of Pro∣vision from <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Welch</HI> by the Advantage of being acquainted with the straits and narrow Pas∣sages, cut off all that straggled from the <HI>English</HI> Camp, so that in time, they were glad to take up with Horse-flesh, and any thing were it never so mean, which might till up their greedy and empty Stomachs. At last King <HI>John</HI> finding no other Remedy, and perceiving it impossible to continue longer there so hungry and fainty, thought it his wisest way to march for <HI>England</HI> and leave the <HI>Welch</HI> to themselves, and so he decamped in a great fury, leaving <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> to bury that great number of Dead, which had starved in this successless Expedition. But to recover the Honour he had now lost, he was resolved to try another touch with the <HI>Welch,</HI> but possibly not with the same con∣fidence and assurance of Victory. And therefore returning to <HI>Wales</HI> in the next <HI>August,</HI> he entred with such another terrible Army of <HI>English,</HI> and was as∣sisted
<PB N="231" REF="152"/> by the same <HI>Welch</HI> Lords, at <HI>Blanchmonastery,</HI> now <HI>Oswestry,</HI> being in the Lordship of <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>William Fitzalan.</HI> In this Expedition, King <HI>John</HI> passing the River <HI>Conwey,</HI> and encamping at the other side towards <HI>Snowden</HI>-Hills, sent part of his Army conducted by Guides who were acquainted with the Country, to burn <HI>Bangor,</HI> which they effectually did; and taking <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pert</HI> Bishop of that See out of Church, they carried him Prisoner to the <HI>English</HI> Camp, where he continued for some time, till he obtained his Ran∣som for a present of two hundred <HI>Hawks.</HI> But Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> finding the whole Strength of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> and almost <HI>Wales</HI> to fight against him, and judging it impossible for himself alone, to withstand so great a multitude, thought it his best way to en∣deavour to find out some method or other, to recon∣cile himself to the King. And no better measures could possibly be thought of, than to send <HI>Joan</HI> his Wife, King <HI>John</HI>'s Daughter, to intreat with her Fa∣ther about a Peace, and a cessation of all Hostilities; who being a prudent, sly Woman, so prevailed upon the King, that he granted Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> her Hus∣band, a safe Conduct to come to him, and to re∣new the former Peace and Amity that was betwixt them. And so <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> having done Homage, pro∣mised the King towards his Expences in this Expe∣dition, 20000 Head of Cattel and forty <HI>Horses,</HI> and what was more than all, he granted all the in-land Countries of <HI>Wales,</HI> with the Appurtenances, to him and his Heirs for ever. And then King <HI>John</HI> having received better Success in this, than the former Ex∣pedition, returned to <HI>England</HI> in great Triumph, ha∣ving subdued all <HI>Wales,</HI> excepting that part which <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> still kept and maintained against the <HI>English.</HI> But having no leisure to march against them himself at his depar∣ture out of the Country, he gave strict charge to <HI>Foulke</HI> Vicount of <HI>Caerdyff,</HI> Warden of the Marches, a cruel Tyrant, tho' well beloved and favoured by the King, to take an Army with him, and so joyn∣ing with <HI>Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Rhys Fychan,</HI> to compel the
<PB N="232" REF="153"/> Sons of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> to acknowledge him for their Sovereign, and to do him Homage. <HI>Foulke</HI> having received so positive a Command, presently raised his Forces, and calling <HI>Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Rhys,</HI> came to the <HI>Cantref</HI> of <HI>Penwedic;</HI> which when the young Lords <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> heard of, and being assured that this Blow was levelled against them, which they knew they were not able to bear, before the Stroak was struck, they sent to <HI>Foulke</HI> to sue for Peace, and a safe Conduct for them to pass to the Court of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> This being granted, they came to <HI>London,</HI> and making their submission to the King, and requesting his Pardon for all former Misdemeanors, they gave up all pretence to their Lands betwixt <HI>Aeron</HI> and <HI>Dyfi;</HI> and so paying their Homage, they were dis∣missed very graciously. But <HI>Foulke</HI> before his depar∣ture out of the Country, fortified the Castle of <HI>Aberystwyth,</HI> and placing a strong Garrison therein, kept it to the King's use. But <HI>Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Rhys Fy∣chan,</HI> a couple of head-strong, inconstant People, quick∣ly repented them of the Peace they had made with the King of <HI>England,</HI> and thereupon, without the least reason or provocation, they laid Siege to <HI>Abery∣stwyth</HI> Castle, and with much ado having made them∣selves Masters of it, they destroyed those Fortifica∣tions which <HI>Foulke</HI> had lately erected, and defaced the Castle to the ground. But they paid sawce for this another way, for as soon as <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> had heard that their Uncles had broken and violated the King's Peace, they made in-roads into <HI>Isaeron,</HI> which was <HI>Maelgon</HI>'s Country, and having slain a considerable number of his Men, among whom was one brave and lusty Youth called <HI>Bachglâs,</HI> they re∣turned with very rich Booty.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1211" UNIT="A.D."/><HI>Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> were quickly followed by the <HI>North-Wales</HI> Men in their revolt from the King of <HI>England,</HI> for Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> being not able to en∣dure any longer the tyranny and oppreission which the King's Garrisons exercised in his Country; called together <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> from <HI>Powys, Maelgon ap Rhys</HI> from <HI>South-Wales, Madoc ap Gruffydh Maylor</HI> from
<PB N="233" REF="153"/> <HI>Bromfield,</HI> and <HI>Meredith ap Rotpert</HI> from <HI>Cydewen,</HI> and plainly declared before them the Pride and insolency of the <HI>English,</HI> and how that they who were always used to have a Prince of their own Nation, were now by their own wilfulness and neglect become subject to Strangers. However, it was not too late to re∣cover their antient Liberty, and if they did but una∣nimously agree among themselves, they might easily cast off that Yoke which was so intolerably burder∣some to them. Then the Lords being sensible of the truth and reasonableness of what Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> de∣livered, and being conscious to themselves that their present slavery and subjection to the <HI>English,</HI> was wholly owing to their own fear and cowardise, swore fealty to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> and swore to be true and faithful to him, and to stick by each other to the ut∣most of their Lives and Fortunes. And so joyning their Forces together, they took all the Castles in <HI>North-Wales</HI> which were in the hands of the <HI>English,</HI> excepting <HI>Ruthlan</HI> and <HI>Dyganwy;</HI> and then going to <HI>Powys,</HI> they laid Siege to the Castle which <HI>Robert Ʋspont</HI> had built at <HI>Mathrafal.</HI> But King <HI>John</HI> be∣ing informed how the <HI>Welch</HI> had conspired against him, and that they had taken and sezied upon almost all his Castles in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and how that they were now in actual besiegement of <HI>Mathrafal,</HI> presently drew up his Army, and coming to <HI>Mathrafal,</HI> quick∣ly raised the Siege, and to prevent the <HI>Welch</HI> from coming any more against it, he burnt it to the ground and so returned to <HI>England,</HI> having no time to stay any longer in <HI>Wales,</HI> by reason of the Diffe∣rences that happened betwixt him and his Nobility. But being afterwards at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and hearing how that Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> cruelly harrassed and destroyed the Marches, he caused all the <HI>Welch</HI> Pledges which he had received the last year to be hanged, among whom were <HI>Howel</HI> the Son of <HI>Cadwalhon,</HI> and <HI>Madoc</HI> the Son of <HI>Maelgon,</HI> with many others of the Nobilities Sons, to the number of Twenty Eight. And about the same time <HI>Robert Vepont</HI> caused <HI>Rhys</HI> the Son of <HI>Maelgon</HI> to be hanged at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> being a Youth
<PB N="234" REF="154"/> of about seventeen years of age, and so cruelly mur∣dered the innocent Child to revenge the Crimes and Offences committed by his Father and others. But tho' King <HI>John</HI> was so severe to the <HI>Welch,</HI> yet the Princess of <HI>North-Wales</HI> was more dutiful and fa∣vourable to him, for whilst he staid at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> she sent him an Express, declaring how that the Ba∣rons had entred into a Conspiracy with the <HI>French</HI> King against him, and that this latter was a prepa∣ring and raising an Army to come over to <HI>England,</HI> upon pretence that the King was a Rebel, and bid open Defiance to the Holy Church, in as much as he would not condescend nor yield to the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI>'s Request. And in confirmation of all this, she told him that <HI>Robert Fitzwalter, Eustace de Vescy</HI> and <HI>Stephen Redell,</HI> were secretly fled into <HI>France,</HI> to pro∣mote and carry on this intrigue. And that this de∣sign against King <HI>John</HI> was no feigned surmise, the next <MILESTONE N="1212" UNIT="A.D."/> year Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the Third detached one of his Nuncio's to <HI>Wales,</HI> who absolved Prince <HI>Lhewelyn, Gwenwynwyn</HI> and <HI>Maelgon</HI> from their Oaths of Al∣legiance to King <HI>John,</HI> and withal gave them a strict command under the penalty of Excommunication, to molest and annoy him with all their Endeavours, as an open Enemy to the Church of God. Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> you may be sure, was not in the least trou∣bled at this, for now he gained the fittest opportu∣nity imaginable, to restore such Lands as he had for∣merly much against his mind delivered up to the King, being the in-land Country of <HI>Denbigh</HI> and <HI>Flint,</HI> which <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> at this time repossessed himself of. And well it was, he was so quick, for within a little while after, King <HI>John</HI> by the persuasions of <HI>Pandulph</HI> the Pope's Legate, granted his Holiness all his Request, and so obtained Absolution at <HI>Pandulph</HI>'s hands, and upon performance of his Promises, an as∣surance of a releasement from that Ecclesiastical Bull, which had so formidably roared against him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1213" UNIT="A.D."/><HI>South-Wales</HI> had now been quiet for a considerable time, and they that used to be commonly very tur∣bulent and contentious, were now pretty easy and
<PB N="235" REF="154"/> amicable. But it was impossible that such a peace∣able Course of Life should hold long, where In∣justice and Oppression had so much Liberty, and where People were wrongfully kept out of their just and rightful Inheritance. And this was the occasion of the breach of that quietness, which for the two or three years last past they had so satisfactorily en∣joyed. For <HI>Rhys</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> who was right Heir to Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> finding he could have no share of his Father's Estate, but that his Uncles forcibly kept all from him, thought it his best way to make his Case known to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and to desire a remedy and redress from him. King <HI>John</HI> in compassion of the young Man's hard Condition, sent to his Deputy <HI>Foulke</HI> Vicount of <HI>Caerdyff</HI> War∣den of the Marches, and to the Steward of <HI>Hereford,</HI> commanding them to take away all <HI>Ystratywy</HI> from <HI>Rhys Fychan,</HI> by some called <HI>Rhys Gryg,</HI> unless he would permit his Nephews to enjoy <HI>Lhanymdhyfry</HI>-Castle, with all the Lands and Priviledges thereunto belonging. <HI>Foulke</HI> having received such Orders from his Master the King of <HI>England,</HI> sent to acquaint <HI>Rhys</HI> of the Proposals, and so demand of him whe∣ther or no he would deliver up <HI>Lhanymdhyfry</HI> to his Nephews, according to the Kin'gs Command; who returned answer, that he did not know of any such Obligation due from him to the King of <HI>England,</HI> as to part with his Lands at his Command, and therefore assured him peremptorily and in plain terms, that he would not willingly part with one foot of what he was in present possession of. <HI>Foulke</HI> therefore having received this resolute Answer, was likewise as resolute to get that by force which he could not obtain by fair means; and so having raised a great Army, he marched to <HI>Talhwynelgain</HI> to meet with young <HI>Rhys,</HI> who was to come thither with all the Forces he could raise in <HI>Brecknock;</HI> and from thence they marched in three Battles towards <HI>Dynefawr,</HI> the first being com∣manded by young <HI>Rhys,</HI> the second by <HI>Foulke</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> Brother to <HI>Rhys</HI> led the third. <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> was not in the least dismayed at their Number, but
<PB N="236" REF="155"/> thinking it more advisable to meet them in the Field, rather than suffer them to block him up at <HI>Dynefawr,</HI> came out very boldly, and gave them Battel, but after a warm Engagement on both sides, <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> in the end got the worse, and after a loss of a great number of his Men, he was glad at last to make his escape by flight. And so retiring to <HI>Dynefawr,</HI> he doubled the Garrison of that place, but thinking the Town of <HI>Lhandeilo-fawr</HI> not to be Tenable, he burnt it to the Ground, and then kept himself private in the Woods and other desart places. But young <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Foulke</HI> laid Siege to <HI>Dynefawr,</HI> and in the first Assault came on so fiercely, that they forced the Garrison to retire to the Castle, which for some time they de∣fended very manfully. But the besiegers began to play so violently with their battering Engines, and to undermine the Wall in such a manner, that the Governour after a short defence began to Capitulate, giving three Pledges for security, that if they received no Relief by the morrow at Noon, the Castle should be surrendred up, conditionally that the Garrison should march out with all the Tokens of Honour, and carry their Arms and all other Implements of War along with them. No Relief being arrived, the Castle the next day was accordingly surrendred, and all the Articles of the Capitulation observed; and so young <HI>Rhys</HI> being possessed of <HI>Dynefawr,</HI> in a little time afterward, brought all <HI>Cantref-fawr</HI> to his subjection. When <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> was sensible how the stream run violently against him, he thought it his wisest way to remove his Wife and Children, and all his other Effects, to his Brother <HI>Maelgon</HI>'s Country, and so leaving <HI>Lhanymdhyfry</HI> Castle well manned and fortified, he departed towards <HI>Aberystwyth.</HI> But as soon as <HI>Foulke</HI> was returned to the Marches, young <HI>Rhys</HI> came with an Army consisting of <HI>Welch</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> before <HI>Lhanymdhyfry,</HI> intending to besiege that place, but before they were encamped before the Town, the Governour thought it his best way to surrender, upon Condition only, that the Garri∣son should depart away with their Lives. And short∣ly
<PB N="237" REF="155"/> afterwards, <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> was taken at <HI>Caermar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dhyn,</HI> and committed to the King's Prison, and so all the Disturbances and Troubles of <HI>South-Wales</HI> came to a peaceable issue. But it was not so in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> for Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> being desirous to rid his Country from the insupportable Tyranny and Op∣pression of the <HI>English</HI> Garrisons, laid Siege to the Castles of <HI>Dyganwy</HI> and <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> the only places now remaining in the hands of the <HI>English,</HI> which he took without any great opposition, and so freed his Country from any Title or Pretence the King of <HI>England</HI> might claim in <HI>North-Wales.</HI> King <HI>John</HI> in∣deed was engaged another way, and consequently in no good Condition to help himself, for having re∣pented of all the indignities and stubborness he ex∣pressed against Pope <HI>Innocent;</HI> at this time he received Penance at the hands of the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to attone for all the severities he had practised against the Church. And to restore him∣self the more to his Holiness Favour, he made the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> Tributary to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to be holden of the Pope, in paying him the summ of 1000 Marks yearly for ever; and withal recalled and restored to their former Preferments and Places all such as had been banished, or had vo∣luntarily fled the Kingdom upon the account of their strict adherence and submission to the Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all, for the next year King <HI>John</HI> with <MILESTONE N="1215" UNIT="A.D."/> two of his Nobility, the Earls of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Derby,</HI> was resolved upon a Voyage to the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> but was unfortunately prevented of his Journey, by the Rebellion of his Barons, which now broke forth vio∣lently by reason that the King would not grant them some antient Laws and Priviledges, such as their fore-Fathers always enjoyed. Therefore the Barons en∣tered into a Confederacy with Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> desiring him to make what Diversion he could on his part, which they were resolved to do on theirs; and so having raised an Army, they ap∣pointed <HI>Robert Fitzwalter</HI> their General. Coming to
<PB N="238" REF="156"/> <HI>Bedford,</HI> they were honourably received into the Ca∣stle by <HI>William Beauchamp,</HI> and from thence march∣ing to <HI>London,</HI> they were entertained with all the Expressions and Tokens of Joy. King <HI>John</HI> per∣ceiving how powerful they were like to prove, and how that the Country did in a great measure fa∣vour their Cause, thought it his wisest way to nip them in the bud, and to fall upon them before they grew too strong; and therefore having levied his Forces, he marched together with <HI>William Marshall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> towards the Castle of <HI>Rochester.</HI> Being arrived there, he laid close Siege to the Castle, but the Governour <HI>William de Abbineto</HI> so bravely defended it, that it could hardly be taken after three Months Siege, but at length the King's Men bore on so violently, that they took it by a Storm, where be∣sides <HI>William de Abbineto,</HI> the King took several of the Barons Prisoners. This was an ill beginning to the Design of the Confederates, and what did not add a little to their Misfortune, the Pope presently issues out his Bull of Excommunication against <HI>Lhewe∣lyn</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and all the <HI>English</HI> Barons as made War against King <HI>John,</HI> who was under the protection of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> But Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> did not regard his threatning Anathemas, and therefore having raised an Army, he came to <HI>Shrews∣bury,</HI> which was delivered up to him without any re∣sistance. And whilst <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> remained there, <HI>Giles de Bruce</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hereford,</HI> one of the chief of this Conspiracy, sent his Brother <HI>Reynold</HI> to <HI>Brecnock</HI> whom all the People readily ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for their Lord; and so without the least grumbling or opposition he received the Castles of <HI>Abergefenny</HI> and <HI>Pencelhy,</HI> the <HI>Castelh Gwyn,</HI> or the White Castle, together with <HI>Grosmont</HI> Castle and the Island of <HI>Cynuric.</HI> But when the Bishop came thither in Person, he had the Castles of <HI>Aberhondhy, Hay, Buelht,</HI> and <HI>Blaenlhyfny,</HI> delivered up to him; but thinking he had enough himself, and being rather desirous to secure his Interest, and to strengthen his Party in the Country, than to heap more upon his own shoulders than he was well able
<PB N="239" REF="156"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o support, he bestowed <HI>Payn</HI> Castle, <HI>Clune</HI> and all <HI>Eluel</HI> upon <HI>Walter Fychan,</HI> the Son of <HI>Eineon Clyd.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, young <HI>Rhys</HI> the Son of <HI>Gruffydh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p Rhys,</HI> and his Uncle <HI>Maelgon</HI> were reconciled and made Friends, and so coming both to <HI>Dyfed,</HI> they de∣stroyed <HI>Arberth</HI> and <HI>Maenclochoc</HI> Castles, and recover∣ed all such Lands as formerly belonged to them, ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epting <HI>Cemais.</HI> But <HI>Rhys</HI>'s Brothers <HI>Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> went to <HI>North-Wales</HI> and did Homage and Feal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> whilst their Brother Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> marched forward to <HI>Cydwely,</HI> and having rased the Castles of <HI>Carnwylheon</HI> and <HI>Lhy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hwr,</HI> brought all the Country about under his subjection. But this was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot enough to satisfy the ambitious humour of that young Prince, for having once tasted the pleasure of Victory, and the taking and demolishing of Towns, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was resolved to prosecute his Conquest whilst For∣tune seemed to favour his Undertakings; and there∣fore he lead his Army against <HI>Talybont</HI> Castle, which belonged to <HI>Hugh de Miles,</HI> and forcing his entrance into the same, he put a great number of the Garri∣son to the Sword. The next day he marched to <HI>Sen∣gennyth</HI> Castle, but the Garrison which kept it, think∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng it fruitless and to no purpose to oppose him, burnt the place, and departed to <HI>Ystymlhwynarth.</HI> But he fol∣lowed them at the Heels, and the next day took it, and rased it to the ground, and over-ran the Coun∣try in such a violent manner, that in three days time, he became Master of all the Castles and Fortresses in all <HI>Gowerland</HI> and <HI>Morgannwe,</HI> and so returned home with great Victory and Triumph. At the same time <HI>Rhyt Fychan,</HI> otherwise <HI>Rhys Gryg,</HI> young Prince <HI>Rhys</HI>'s Uncle, obtained his Liberty from the King of <HI>England,</HI> leaving his Son with two more for Pledges for his modest and peaceable Behaviour towards his Sub∣jects, whom at other times he was wont to molest and oppress. About this time the Abbots of <HI>Tal y Llecheu</HI> and <HI>Tuy Gwyn,</HI> were consecrated Bishops, the former of St. <HI>Davids,</HI> and the other of <HI>Bangor.</HI> But the Bishop of <HI>Hereford</HI> who seemed to be the most violently inclined against King <HI>John,</HI> and was other∣wise
<PB N="240" REF="157"/> unwilling to part with what he had got in <HI>Wales's</HI> could not for all that refuse the Injunction of the Pope, by whose express Command he was constrain∣ed to make Peace with the King, which being con∣cluded, in his return homeward, he died at <HI>Gloce∣ster,</HI> leaving his Estate to his Brother <HI>Reginald,</HI> who had married the Daughter of Prince <HI>Lhewelyn.</HI></P>
<P>But for all that, <HI>Giles de Bruce</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hereford</HI> was fallen off, and reconciled to King <HI>John,</HI> yet Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> did not think it convenient to follow his Ex∣ample, and therefore with his whole Army he march∣ed against <HI>Carmardhyn,</HI> and took the Castle in five days, having rased it to the ground, he successively laid Siege to the Castles of <HI>Lhanstephan,</HI> St. <HI>Cleare,</HI> and <HI>Talacharn,</HI> which he used after the same manner. From thence he went to <HI>Cardigan,</HI> and winning <HI>Emlyn</HI> Castle, he subdued <HI>Cemaes,</HI> and then laying Siege to <HI>Trefdraeth</HI> Castle, in <HI>English</HI> called <HI>Newport,</HI> he quick∣ly took it, and afterwards rased it to the ground. His next Design was upon <HI>Aberteifi</HI> and <HI>Cilgerra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Castles, but the Garrisons which defended them, find∣ing it to no purpose to wait his coming, and so to withstand all his Attempts against those places volun∣tarily surrendred, and by that means prevented all the Mischief, which in opposing him, would in all probability unavoidably attend them. And so Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> having successfully over-run and subdued all <HI>Carmardhyn</HI> and <HI>Cardigan,</HI> triumphantly returned to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> being attended by several of the <HI>Welch</HI> Nobility, such as <HI>Howel ap Gruffydh ap Conan, Lhe∣welyn ap Meredith, Gwenwynwyn</HI> Lord of <HI>Powys, Me∣redith ap Rotpert, Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> the Sons of Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> of <HI>South Wales, Rhys</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> together with all the Power of <HI>Madoc ap Gruffydh Maylor</HI> Lord of <HI>Brom∣field.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1216" UNIT="A.D."/> But the next year Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> returned to <HI>A∣berteifi</HI> to compose a Difference, which since his de∣parture, had happened betwixt <HI>Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Rhys Fychan,</HI> Prince <HI>Rhys</HI>'s Sons on the one side, and <HI>Rhys</HI> and <HI>Owen, Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI>'s Sons on the other.
<PB N="241" REF="157"/> Therefore to make up this Quarrel, and to reduce all Matters to a quiet and amicable issue, Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> made an equal distribution of <HI>South-Wales</HI> be∣twixt them, allotting to <HI>Maelg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> three Cantrefs in <HI>Dyfed,</HI> viz. <HI>Gwarthaf, Penlhwynoc, Cemaes,</HI> and <HI>Emlyn</HI> with <HI>Cilgerran</HI> Castle; to young <HI>Rhys,</HI> two Castles in <HI>Ystratywy, Hiruryn</HI> and <HI>Maelhaen, Maenor Bydfey,</HI> with the Castle of <HI>Lhanymdhyfry,</HI> and two in <HI>Cardigan Gwy∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yth</HI> and <HI>Mabwyneon.</HI> His Brother <HI>Owen</HI> had to his share the Castles of <HI>Aberteifi</HI> and <HI>Nant yr Arian,</HI> with three Cantress in <HI>Cardigan;</HI> and <HI>Rhys Fychan,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Rhys Gryc,</HI> had <HI>Dynefawr</HI> Castle, the <HI>Cantref Mawr,</HI> the <HI>Cantref Bychan,</HI> excepting <HI>Hiruryn</HI> and <HI>Midhfey,</HI> together with the Comotes of <HI>Cydwely</HI> and <HI>Carnwylhion.</HI> This Division being accomplished to every one's Satisfaction, and all the Lords of <HI>South-Wales</HI> being amicably reconciled, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> took his Journey for <HI>North-Wales;</HI> but he had not advanced very far, when News was brought him that <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> Lord of <HI>Powys</HI> was revolted, and was become again the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Subject. This unwelcome News struck very deep in the Prince's Mind, by reason that <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> was a Man of great Power and Strength in the Country, and went a great way to repel the Incursions of the <HI>English</HI> up∣on the Marches, which now he being gone off, could not, he feared, be so well effected. But however, to make the best of a bad Market, he endeavoured to take him off from the <HI>English,</HI> and to restore him to his former Allegiance due to himself as his Natural Prince; and to that end, he sent to him some Bishops and Abbots to put him in mind of his Oath and Pro∣mise, how that he with the rest of the Lords of <HI>Wales,</HI> had obliged himself to oppose the <HI>English</HI> to the ut∣most of his Power; and had delivered Pledges for the sure performance of what he had then by Oath en∣gaged in; and lest he should have forgot what he had then promised, he was desired to read his own hand Writing, whereby it was apparent that he had very unjustly violated both his Oath and Promise. But all the Rhetorick the Bishops could make use of,
<PB N="242" REF="158"/> was not of force enough to work <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> to re∣conciliation with the Prince, and an aversion to the King of <HI>England;</HI> and therefore seeing nothing would do, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> was resolved to make him inca∣pable of serving the <HI>English,</HI> and so entring <HI>Powys</HI> with a strong Army, he subdued the whole Country to himself, <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> being forced to fly for Succor to the Earl of <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst these things passed in <HI>Wales, Lewis</HI> the <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>France</HI> being invited by the <HI>English</HI> Barons against King <HI>John,</HI> landed in the Island of <HI>Thanet,</HI> and marching forward to <HI>London,</HI> he there received Homage of all the Barons, that were in actual War against the King. And then setting forward to <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> where King <HI>John</HI> then lay, he took in his way the Castles of <HI>Rygat, Guildford</HI> and <HI>Farnham,</HI> and coming to <HI>Winchester,</HI> had the Town presently surrendred to him. King <HI>John</HI> did not think fit to abide his coming, but removing to <HI>Hereford,</HI> in the Marches of <HI>Wales,</HI> he sent to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> and <HI>Reynold Bruce,</HI> desiring their Friendship, and imploring their Aid aad Assistance against the <HI>French.</HI> But they refusing to hearken to his Proposals, he destroyed <HI>Radnor</HI> and <HI>Hay</HI> Castles, and marching forward to <HI>Oswestry,</HI> which belonged to <HI>John Fitzalan,</HI> he burnt it to the ground, and then departed towards the <HI>North.</HI> But after that he had settled his Affairs there, and ap∣pointed Governours in all the Towns and Places of Strength; whilst he was making all necessary Prepa∣rations at <HI>Newark</HI> to confront the Barons, he fell sick, and in a short time died, and was buried at <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>After his Death his Son <HI>Henry</HI> was by several of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility proclaimed King, and in a little while, most of the Barons, who upon their hatred to King <HI>John,</HI> had maintained an open War against him, came in, and owned their Allegiance to his Son <HI>Henry,</HI> tho contrary to their Oath to <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Dau∣phine.</HI> <MILESTONE N="1217" UNIT="A.D."/> But what was most pernicious to the <HI>Welch, Reynald de Bruce</HI> who had all this while maintained a Confederacy with Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> his Father-in-Law
<PB N="243" REF="158"/> against King <HI>John,</HI> underhand made his Peace with King <HI>Henry.</HI> But he suffered severely for his Trea∣chery; for young <HI>Rhys,</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> his Nephew by his Sister, seeing that he in whom they put their great∣est Confidence, had deceitfully forsaken them, came upon him with all their Power, and took from him all <HI>Buelht,</HI> excepting only the Castle. Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> was presently made acquainted with <HI>Bruce</HI>'s re∣volt, but as soon as he was informed that his Son-in-Law was gone over to the King of <HI>England,</HI> he went in great fury to <HI>Brecknoc,</HI> and laying Siege to the Town of <HI>Aberhondhy,</HI> he was with much ado prevail∣ed upon by young <HI>Rhys</HI> to raise the Siege for the summ of a Hundred Marks; and then crossing the Mountanous part of <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> called the <HI>Black Mountains,</HI> where his Carriages suffered very much, he came to <HI>Gwyr,</HI> and encamping at <HI>Lhangruc, Rey∣nald Bruce</HI> with six Knights in his Company, came to meet him, desiring his Pardon for his passed Of∣fence, assuring him that for the future, he would be true and faithful to him, and would to his endeavour assist him against the King of <HI>England.</HI> Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> was too good natured to reject his submission, and so did not only receive him to his Favour, but bestowed upon him also the Castle of <HI>Senghennyth,</HI> which <HI>Reynald</HI> committed to the Custody of <HI>Rhys Fy∣chan.</HI> Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> having settled all things in good Order in <HI>Gwyr,</HI> marched to <HI>Dyfed,</HI> and being at <HI>Cefn Cynwarchan,</HI> the <HI>Flemings</HI> sent their Agents to him to desire Peace, which the Prince, by reason that they always adhered to the <HI>English</HI> Interest, would not grant them. And so young <HI>Rhys</HI> having the first Man passed the River <HI>Cledeu</HI> to Storm the Town, <HI>Iorwerth</HI> Bishop of St. <HI>Davids,</HI> with the rest of his Clergy came to the Prince to intreat for a Peace for the <HI>Flemings,</HI> which after a long debate, was granted, and concluded upon these Terms; First, That all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhabitants of <HI>Rhôs,</HI> and the Coun∣try of <HI>Pembroke</HI> should from thence forward swear Allegiance to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> and ever after ac∣knowledge his Sovereignty. Secondly, That towards
<PB N="244" REF="159"/> the defraying of his Charges in this Expedition, they should pay one Thousand Marks to be deliver∣ed to him before the ensuing Feast of St. <HI>Michael.</HI> Thirdly, That for the sure performance of these Ar∣ticles they should deliver up Twenty Hostages, who were to be some of the most Principal Persons in their Country. Then Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> having now brought all <HI>Wales</HI> subject to himself, and put Mat∣ters in a settled posture in <HI>South Wales,</HI> returned to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> having purchased very considerable Honour and Esteem for his Martial Achievements in this Expedition.</P>
<P>And now all Matters of Differences being adjusted, and the <HI>Welch</HI> in good hopes of a durable Freedom from all Troubles and Hostilities; another Accident unhappily fell out to cross their Expectation. <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Dauphin</HI> perceiving the <HI>English</HI> Barons to slight and forsake him, concluded a Peace with King <HI>Henry,</HI> and returned to <HI>France;</HI> and then the Barons, the King promising to answer all their Request, and to redress their Grievances, made their submission, without including the <HI>Welch</HI> in their Articles. They had all this while gladly embraced the Friendship and Aid of the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> but now upon their Reconciliation to the King, thinking they had no farther need of him, they very basely forsook him, who had been the principal Support and Suc∣cour of their Cause. And not only so, but they conspired together to convert their Arms against <HI>Wales,</HI> thinking they could without any breach of Equity or Conscience, take away the Lands of the <HI>Welch,</HI> to make addition to what some of them had already unjustly possessed themselves of. <HI>William Marshall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> opened the Scene, and com∣ing unexpectedly upon the <HI>Welch,</HI> took the Town of <HI>Caerlheon.</HI> But he got nothing by this, for <HI>Rhys Fy∣chan</HI> perceiving what he would fain be at, ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <HI>Sen∣ghennyth</HI> Castle, and all the rest in his Custody in that Country, and banishing the <HI>English</HI> with their Wives and Children, divided the Country betwixt <MILESTONE N="1218" UNIT="A.D."/> the <HI>Welch,</HI> who kept sure possession of it. Prince
<PB N="245" REF="159"/> <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> also finding those to become his Foes, who had but lately courted his Friendship, and fearing lest that the <HI>English</HI> being now in Arms should make any Attempt upon his Castles, augmented the Garri∣sons of <HI>Carmardhyn</HI> and <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> to make them ca∣pable of withstanding the <HI>English,</HI> in case they should come against them. But tho' the <HI>Welch</HI> and <HI>English</HI> were at open Variance and in actual Hostility one against another, yet young <HI>Rhys</HI> with Prince <HI>Lhewe∣lyn</HI>'s approbation and consent, thought it advisable to go and do Homage to the King of <HI>England,</HI> for his Lands in <HI>Wales.</HI> This might be thought a matter of Supererogation, to make courtship to one who was declared Enemy to all the <HI>Welch,</HI> and one that would not in all probability, suffer him to enjoy a quiet pos∣session of his Estate, in case he had Ability and Op∣portunity to eject him. But the <HI>Welch</HI> Interest was <MILESTONE N="1219" UNIT="A.D."/> in a great measure augmented by a new Alliance with some of the most powerful among the <HI>English; Rhys Gryc,</HI> Prince <HI>Rhys</HI>'s Son, being married to the Earl of <HI>Clare</HI>'s Daughter; and <HI>Marret,</HI> Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI>'s Daughter, to <HI>John Bruce.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> had quickly an occasion to <MILESTONE N="1220" UNIT="A.D."/> experience his Power, for the <HI>Flemings</HI> in <HI>Dyfed,</HI> who had lately sworn Allegiance to him, began now to repent of what they had but a little time ago gladly submitted to, and contrary to their Oaths, and the League they had sworn to observe, they fell upon <HI>Aberteifi</HI> Castle, which they took. Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> being highly displeased with the treacherous practices of these perjured <HI>Flemings,</HI> marched with all speed to <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> and having recovered the Castle, which he afterwards rased, he put all the Garrison to the Sword. <HI>Gwys</HI> was served in the same manner, and the Town of <HI>Haverford</HI> was burnt to the ground, and over-running <HI>Rhos</HI> and <HI>Daugledhau,</HI> he committed a lamentable Destruction throughout the whole Coun∣try. This the <HI>Flemings</HI> received as the due reward of their sinistrous Dealing, which made them quickly apprehensive of their folly, and their imprudent Be∣haviour towards the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and therefore
<PB N="246" REF="160"/> being sorrowfully sensible how unable they were to put a stop to his farther progress by force of Arms, they made Overtures for Cessation of all Hostilities till the <HI>May</HI> following, which being granted them up∣on strict Conditions, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> returned to <HI>North-Wales.</HI> In the mean time some <HI>Welch</HI> Lords besieged <HI>Buelht</HI> Castle, which was in the possession of <HI>Reynald Bruce,</HI> but before they could take it, King <HI>Henry</HI> brought an Army to the Marches and raised the Siege, and then marching forward to <HI>Montgomery,</HI> built a new Castle in that Town.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1221" UNIT="A.D."/> The next year an unhappy dissention fell out be∣twixt Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> and his Son <HI>Gruffydh</HI> this lat∣ter having kept himself in possession of the Cantref of <HI>Merionyth,</HI> contrary to the Consent and well-liking of his Father. The Prince therefore having now no great matter of moment abroad, was resolved to curb the Insolency of his Son, and therefore sent to him to command his appearance, and to wish him to deliver up the Cantref quietly, lest he should be forced to take it violently out of his Hands. <HI>Gruf∣fydh</HI> was not in the least dismayed at his threat∣nings, but being resolved to keep what at present he enjoyed, would neither go to his Father, nor de∣liver up the Cantref to him. The Prince being en∣raged that he should be so slighted by his Son, made a vehement Protestation, that he would be severely revenged both of him and all his accomplices; and therefore coming to <HI>Merionyth</HI> with a great Army, was resolved to drive his Son out of the Country. But <HI>Gruffydh</HI> made all possible preparations to op∣pose his Father, and drew up his Forces to give him Battel, but when both Armies were ready to joyn, the Differences betwixt th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m was happily composed, and <HI>Gruffydh</HI> prevailed upon to make his submis∣sion to his Father. But the Prince, tho' he forgave his Son his Offence, and received him to favour, would not however, permit him to enjoy <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ionyth</HI> and <HI>Ardydwy;</HI> but taking them away from him, and building a Castle in the latter, returned home. But he had not continued long at his Palace a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Aber∣ffraw,</HI>
<PB N="247" REF="160"/> when another occasion called him abroad; for young <HI>Rhys</HI> being disappointed of <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> which in the division of <HI>South Wales</HI> was allotted to his share, forsook the Prince, and put himself under the prote∣ction of <HI>Willam Marshal</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrock.</HI> Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> hearing this, marched in great haste to <HI>Abe∣rystwyth,</HI> and being desirous to punish <HI>Rhys</HI> for his de∣sertion from his Allegiance due to him, seized to his own use that Castle, together with all the Demain and Lands belonging to it. When <HI>Rhys</HI> understood what the Prince had done, he presently made his Complaint to the King of <HI>England,</HI> who coming to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and sending for Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> adjust∣ed matters so betwixt them, that the Prince promised to treat with <HI>Rhys</HI> for <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> after the same man∣ner as he had done with <HI>Maelgon</HI> for <HI>Caermardhyn.</HI> And towards the close of the Year, <HI>John Bruce,</HI> Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>'s Son in Law, obtained leave to for∣tifie <HI>Senghennyth</HI> Castle, which in right to the Prince's grant to <HI>Raynald Bruce,</HI> belonged to him. But young <HI>Rhys</HI> did not long survive the Agreement betwixt him and Prince <HI>Lhewelyn;</HI> for he dyed the following <MILESTONE N="1222" UNIT="A.D."/> Year, and was buried at <HI>Ystratflur;</HI> after whose death, the Prince divided his Estate betwixt his Bro∣ther <HI>Owen</HI> and his Uncle <HI>Maelgon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Marshal</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrock</HI> was now in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and very busie in prosecuting the War against the King of <HI>England's</HI> Enemies in that Kingdom; the opportunity of whose absence Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> taking advantage of, won the Castles of <HI>Aberteifi</HI> and <HI>Caermardhyn,</HI> belonging to the Earl; and put∣ting both the Garrisons to the Sword, placed in their room a strong Party of his own Men. But when the Earl was informed of what the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> had done, he presently left <HI>Ireland,</HI> and landed at S. <HI>Da∣vids</HI> with a great Army, and having recovered his Castles, he treated the <HI>Welch</HI> after the same manner, as Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> had used his Garrisons, and pas∣sing forward into the Prince's Country, destroyed all before him as he went along. The Prince under∣standing how violently he came forward, sent his
<PB N="248" REF="161"/> Son <HI>Gruffydh</HI> with a considerable Body of Men to check his Fury; who coming to <HI>Cydwely,</HI> and re∣ceiving intelligence that the Magistrates of that place, had a private design to betray him to the Enemy, he put the whole Town in Flames, and burnt it to the ground, without sparing either Churches, or o∣ther Religious Houses. The Earl of <HI>Pembrock</HI> had passed the River <HI>Tywy</HI> at <HI>Caermardhyn,</HI> where <HI>Gruf∣fydh</HI> met him, and gave him battel; but the Victory proved so uncertain, that the Night was forced to part them; and so the <HI>English</HI> retired over the River. <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> writes, that the Earl obtained a very signal Victory, and that of the <HI>Welch</HI> there were Nine Thousand slain and taken; though the <HI>Welch</HI> Ac∣count, which in this case is in all likelihood the best, makes the whole Army of the <HI>Welch</HI> to consist but of that number. But both Armies having layn for certain Days in that posture, and the River <HI>Tywy</HI> being betwixt them; <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> by reason that Provision began to grow scarce in his Camp, return∣ed back; and then the Earl decamped, and march∣ed to <HI>Cilgerran,</HI> where he began to build a very strong Castle. But before he could have time to fi∣nish it, he received an Express from the King, with orders to come to him; and so he went by Sea to <HI>London,</HI> leaving his Army at <HI>Cilgerran,</HI> to continue the Work which he had begun. Shortly after, the King, together with the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> came to <HI>Ludlow,</HI> and sending for Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> thither, they had good hopes to adjust all Differences, and to make an amicable Composition betwixt him and the Earl. But when this could not be effected, both Parties sticking close to their private Interest; the Earl being assisted by the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> and <HI>Hen∣ry Pyggot</HI> Lord of <HI>Ewyas,</HI> designed to pass by Land to <HI>Pembrock;</HI> but his purpose being discovered to the Prince, he detached his Son to secure the Pas∣sage of <HI>Carnwylhion,</HI> and came in person to <HI>Mabe∣dryd;</HI> which when the Earl understood, finding it dangerous to prosecute his Design any further, he re∣turned to <HI>England;</HI> and then the Prince marched to
<PB N="249" REF="161"/> <HI>North-Wales.</HI> The next Action that passed in <HI>Wales,</HI><MILESTONE N="1227" UNIT="A.D."/> was somewhat rare, and not redounding much to the Credit and Esteem of the <HI>Welch;</HI> for <HI>Rhys Fychan,</HI> having by some sinistrous means or other, taken his Father <HI>Rhys Gryc,</HI> contrary to all filial Affection and Duty, detained him Prisoner, and would not set him at liberty, till he had delivered up <HI>Lhanymdhyfri</HI> Ca∣stle to him. About the same time, <HI>Meredith,</HI> Arch∣deacon of <HI>Cardigan,</HI> Prince <HI>Rhys</HI>'s Son, departed this Life, and was honourably interred at S. <HI>Davids,</HI> by his Father.</P>
<P>But a while after, a great Storm threatned the <MILESTONE N="1228" UNIT="A.D."/> <HI>Welch;</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> having raised a great Army, was resolved to make a violent Prosecution of the Earl of <HI>Pembrock</HI>'s Quarrel, against the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and if possible, to make all that Country, for ever subject to the Crown of <HI>England;</HI> and so being advanced into the Marches, he encamped at <HI>Ceri.</HI> Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> on the other hand, being informed of these mighty Preparations in <HI>England,</HI> and understanding that they were intended against him, did use all the Endeavours possible, to make a vigorous Resistance; and having drawn together all the Forces he was able to levy, thought it his wisest way to meet the <HI>English</HI> upon the Marches, and not to permit the Enemy to enter his Country. Both Armies being come in sight of each other, frequent Skirmishes happened betwixt 'em; but one day, almost the whole Armies engaged, and after a vigorous Attack of both sides, the <HI>English</HI> at last got the worst, and were forced to retire, having a great many Men slain and taken Prisoners. Among the lat∣ter, was <HI>William Bruce, Reynald</HI>'s Son, who offered for his Ransom all <HI>Buelht,</HI> together with a considera∣ble Sum of Money, which the Prince would not ac∣cept of. But King <HI>Henry</HI> finding that his Army was worsted in this Rencounter, thought it best to make Peace with the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> which being con∣cluded, <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> came to the King, and having paid him all other Respects, besides that of Submission and Allegiance, he returned in great Honour to <HI>North-Wales.</HI> But this Action is somewhat otherwise laid
<PB N="250" REF="162"/> down by <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> who writes, that this Skir∣mish betwixt the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welch</HI> happened upon an other account; for the Garrison of <HI>Montgomery</HI> issuing out of the Castle, to enlarge a certain Passage leading through a Wood, where the <HI>Welch</HI> were wont to rob and kill all Passengers; began to fell the Tim∣ber, and cut down all the Bushes which lessened the Road, thereby to make the Passage more clear and se∣cure. The <HI>Welch</HI> receiving intelligence of this, came presently upon him in great Numbers, and surprizing the Enemies, being busie at their Labour, forced as many as could escape, to betake themselves for refuge into the Castle, which afterwards, having first cast a deep Trench about it, they smartly invested. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bert de Burgh,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England,</HI> and Owner of the Castle, having notice of this, sent presently to King <HI>Henry,</HI> desiring his speedy help against the <HI>Welch,</HI> who thereupon came in Person with part of his Army, and raised the Siege. Then, the rest of his Forces be∣ing arrived, he marched into the Wood, which was Five Miles in length, and by reason of the thickness of the growth impassable; and for an easie passage through it, caused it to be burnt down. After that, he led his Army farther into the Country, and coming to an Abby called <HI>Cridia,</HI> which the <HI>Welch</HI> were wont to take for refuge, he caused it to be burnt down; but finding it a very convenient place for a Fortress, he granted leave to <HI>Hubert de Burgh</HI> to build a Castle there. But whilst the Work was going on, the <HI>Welch-men</HI> gauled the <HI>English,</HI> and skirmished with them frequently, so that many were slain on both sides; but at last <HI>William Bruce,</HI> with many others that went abroad to fetch Provision, was intercepted by the <HI>Welch,</HI> and taken Prisoner, and most of his Compa∣ny were slain, among whom, one who was knighted a few days before, seeing some of his Fellows in great danger, rushed boldly into the midst of his Enemies, and after a manful defence, bravely lost his Life. Several of King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Men were corrupted by Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> and upon that account took no great pains to repulse the Enemy; which when the King perceiv∣ed,
<PB N="251" REF="162"/> and finding withal the Provision was grown ve∣ry scarce in his Camp, he was forced to conclude a dishonourable Peace with the <HI>Welch,</HI> consenting to demolish that Castle, which with so great an Expence both of Men and Mony was now almost finished, upon his own Charges, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> paying only Three Thousand Pounds towards it. Then both Armies se∣parated, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> marching to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and the King leaving <HI>William Bruce</HI> Prisoner with the <HI>Welch,</HI> returned to <HI>England</HI> having purchased no small Discredit in this Expedition.</P>
<P><HI>William Bruce</HI> was brought to <HI>Wales,</HI> and there had <MILESTONE N="1230" UNIT="A.D."/> an honourable Confinement in the Prince his Palace; but he had not continued there very long, when he began to be suspected of being too familiar with the Princess, King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Sister; and as the report went, was take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the very act of Adultery; for which the Prince caused him to be hanged forthwith. About the same time, <HI>Lhewelyn, Maelgon</HI>'s Son dyed in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and was buried at <HI>Conwey;</HI> and <HI>Maelgon,</HI> Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> his Son in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and was buried in <HI>Ystrat∣flur;</HI> whose Estate descended to his Son <HI>Maelgon.</HI> And a little after, <HI>William Marshall,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pem∣brock</HI><MILESTONE N="1231" UNIT="A.D."/> dyed, one that ever entertained an inveterate Enmity to the <HI>Welch,</HI> and upon whose account King <HI>Henry</HI> had chiefly brought his Army into <HI>Wales.</HI> He was succeeded both in his Title and Estate by his Bro∣ther <HI>Richard,</HI> who was much more favourably enclin∣ed towards the <HI>Welch,</HI> and never attempted any thing against them. But the King of <HI>England</HI> was resolved to retrieve the Honour he had lost in the late Expedi∣tion against the <HI>Welch;</HI> and therefore being returned from <HI>France,</HI> whither he had made a Descent, to re∣cover what his Father had lost in that Kingdom, he came to <HI>Wales;</HI> and having remained some time in the Marches, he returned again to <HI>England,</HI> leaving his Army under the command of <HI>Hubert Burgh,</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> to defend the Marches against any in-road which the <HI>Welch</HI> might attempt. And he had not remained there long, when he received Intelligence, that a Party of <HI>Welch</HI> had entered the Marches near
<PB N="252" REF="163"/> <HI>Montgomery,</HI> whom he forthwith pursued, and setting upon them surprizedly, he put a great number of them to the Sword. Prince <HI>Lhewylyn</HI> hearing this, came in Person with a great Army to the Marches, and fitting before <HI>Montgomery</HI> Castle, he forced <HI>Hubert</HI> to withdraw, and then making himself Master of the place, he burnt it to the ground, and put the Garri∣son to the Sword; the like Fate attended the Ca∣stles of <HI>Radnor, Aberhondhy, Rhayadr Gwy, Caerlheon, Neth,</HI> and <HI>Cydwely;</HI> though <HI>Caerlheon</HI> held out very stubbornly, and the Prince had several of his Men destroyed before the Place. King <HI>Henry</HI> being in∣formed of what miserable Desolation the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> so successfully committed upon his Subjects in these Countries, had him presently excommunicated; and then coming to <HI>Hereford</HI> with a mighty Army, he detached the greatest part of it, with a great number of his Nobility to <HI>Wales.</HI> These by the direction of a Fryar of <HI>Cymer,</HI> unexpectedly as they thought, fell upon a Party of <HI>Welch;</HI> who at the first Encounter seemed to fly, till they had allured the <HI>English</HI> to pursue them to a place where a greater Party of <HI>Welch</HI> lay in ambuscade; who rushing of a sudden upon the <HI>English,</HI> put them in such a confu∣sion, that the greatest part of them was cut off. The King being sensible, that this was a treacherous Insi∣nuation of the Friar, was resolved to be revenged, by burning the Abby of <HI>Cymer;</HI> but the Prior, for Three Hundred Marks, prevented it; and so the King returned to <HI>England,</HI> having effected nothing in this Expedition, besides the building of <HI>Mawd</HI> Castle. In the mean time, <HI>Maelgon</HI> Son of <HI>Maelgon ap Rhys</HI> laid siege to <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> and having by force got entry into the Town, he put all the Inhabitants to the Sword, then destroyed all before him to the Castle Gates, which were so strongly fortified, that it seemed al∣most impracticable to take it in any short time. But <HI>Maelgon,</HI> being joyned by his Cosin <HI>Owen, Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI>'s Son, was resolved to try the utmost that could be effected; and therefore taking with him some of Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>'s most experienced Officers,
<PB N="253" REF="163"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brake down the Bridg upon the River <HI>Teifi,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen investing the Castle more closely, he so batter'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd undermin'd it, that he became in a little time Master of it.</P>
<P>The Year following, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> made a De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cent <MILESTONE N="1232" UNIT="A.D."/> upon <HI>England,</HI> and having committed very con∣siderable Waste and Destruction upon the Borders, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturned to <HI>North-Wales</HI> with a rich Booty both of Men and Cattel. King <HI>Henry,</HI> to correct the <HI>Welch</HI> for these grievous Devastations, and to prevent their further Incursions into <HI>England,</HI> demanded a very great Subsidy of his Subjects to carry on the War against the <HI>Welch;</HI> which being granted him, he made all possible Preparations for his Expedition to <HI>Wales.</HI> In the mean time, <HI>Randulph</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> dyed, and was succeeded in that Honour by <HI>John</HI> his Sisters Son, who was afterwards married to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>'s Daughter. But the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> be∣ing in expectation of King <HI>Henry</HI>'s coming thither, began to repair and fortifie their Castles; and particu∣larly, <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwal</HI> rebuilt <HI>Radnor</HI> Castle,<MILESTONE N="1233" UNIT="A.D."/> which the Prince had lately destroyed. Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> was sufficiently sensible, that the King of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> intended an Invasion, and therefore to be before-hand with him, he came with an Army to <HI>Brecknock</HI> destroyed all the Towns and Castles throughout the Country, excepting <HI>Brecknock</HI> Castle, which held out so manfully, that after a Months sitting before it, he was at last constrained to raise the Siege. In his re∣turn to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> he burnt the Town of <HI>Clûn,</HI> recover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all that Country called <HI>Dyffryn Tefeidiat,</HI> in the possession of <HI>John Fitz-Alan,</HI> destroyed <HI>Red</HI> Castle in <HI>Powys,</HI> and burnt <HI>Oswestry.</HI> But what happened very fortunately to the <HI>Welch; Richard Marshal</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> being faln at variance with King <HI>Henry,</HI> took part with Prince <HI>Lhewelyn;</HI> with whom joyned <HI>Hubert de Burgh,</HI> who had lately made his escape out of the Castle of <HI>Devizes,</HI> where the King, upon some Articles of Information brought against him, had committed him to Prison. But the Earl of <HI>Pembrock,</HI> attended by <HI>Owen ap Gruffydh ap Rhys,</HI> came to S. <HI>Da∣vids;</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="164"/> and being very glad of an opportunity to re∣venge himself upon the King, slew every one tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> owned any Dependance upon the Crown of <HI>England▪ Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Rhys Gryc,</HI> with all the Forces of Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> quickly joyned the Earl; who in their march through the Country, took the Castles of <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dyff, Abergevenny, Pencelhy, Blaenlhefyni,</HI> and <HI>Bwlch y Ddinas,</HI> which all, excepting <HI>Cardyff,</HI> they burnt to the ground. The King receiving intelligence, that the Earl of <HI>Pembrock</HI> had entered into a Confederacy with the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and that he was now i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> open Hostility against his Subjects in that Country, gathered a very formidable Army, consisting, besides <HI>English,</HI> of <HI>Flemings, Normans,</HI> and <HI>Gascoigns;</HI> and coming to <HI>Wales,</HI> he encamped at <HI>Grosmont,</HI> where the Earl, with the <HI>Welch</HI> Army met him. But when the <HI>English</HI> would have endeavoured to advance fur∣ther into the Country, the <HI>Welch</HI> opposed them, and so a Battel ensued, wherein the <HI>English</HI> lost Five Hundred Horse, besides a far greater number of their Infantry. The <HI>Welch</HI> having gained a considerable Victory in this Action, the King was advised to with∣draw his Forces, for fear lest that the <HI>Welch</HI> should a∣gain set upon them, and so sustain a greater Loss; which Counsel the King willingly hearkened unto, and so he returned for <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> being withdrawn, the Earl likewise decamped, and marched to <HI>Caermardhyn,</HI> which he besieged; but after Three Months in vain Assault, the Garrison most bravely de∣fending the place; and the <HI>English</HI> Fleet having thrown in new Provisions, he thought it most advise∣able to raise the Siege. Shortly after, <HI>Rhys Gryc,</HI> Son to Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> dyed at <HI>Lhandeilo Fawr,</HI> and was ho∣nourably interr'd by his Father at S. <HI>Davids.</HI> About the same time, <HI>Maelgon Fychan, Maelgon ap Rhys</HI> his Son, finished <HI>Trefilan</HI> Castle, which was begun in his Fathers time.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1234" UNIT="A.D."/> King <HI>Henry</HI> was not willing to hazard any more Campaigns in <HI>Wales,</HI> and therefore he appointed <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> a great Soldier, and General of the <HI>English</HI> Forces, Warden of the Marches of <HI>Wales,</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="164"/> who thinking to get to himself an eternal Name in conquering the <HI>Welch,</HI> raised all the Power he could; and imagining that the <HI>Welch</HI> could not be privy to his purpose, he apprehended he could fall upon the Earl-Marshal unexpected. But in this, he was to his sor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, most widely mistaken; for the Earl having re∣ceived private intimation of his Design, hid himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a certain Wood, by which the <HI>English</HI> were to march; and when they were come so far, the <HI>Welch</HI> of a sudden gave a great shout, and leaping out of the place they had absconded themselves in, they fell <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the <HI>English,</HI> being unprovided, and putting their whole Army to flight, they slew an infinite number both of the <HI>English</HI> and their Auxiliaries. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> himself made his escape by flight; but the Earl-Marshal entering his Country, destroyed it with Fire and Sword. And what added to the Misery of the <HI>English,</HI> Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> in the Week after <HI>Epi∣phany,</HI> joyning the Earl-Marshal, made an Incursion into the King's Territories, destroying all before them, from the Confines of <HI>Wales</HI> to <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> a great part of which they laid in Ashes. King <HI>Henry</HI> was all this while with the Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI> at <HI>Gloce∣ster,</HI> and for want of sufficient Power or Courage to confront the Enemy, durst not take the Field; of which being at length perfectly ashamed, he remov∣ed to <HI>Winchester,</HI> leaving the Marches naked to the mercy of the Enemy. And now, there being no apprehension of fear from the <HI>English,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Pembrock,</HI> by the Counsel of <HI>Geoffrey de Marisco,</HI> transported his Army into <HI>Ireland,</HI> thinking to obtain a Conquest in that Kingdom; but in the first Encoun∣ter with the <HI>Irish,</HI> he was unfortunately slain through the Treachery of his own Men: And so his Estate and Title descended to his Brother <HI>Gilbert.</HI></P>
<P>But King <HI>Henry</HI> finding it impracticable to force the <HI>Welch</HI> to a Submission, and being in a great mea∣sure weary of continual Wars and incessant Hostili∣ties, thought it his best Prudence to make some ho∣nourable Agreement with the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and therefore he deputed <HI>Edmund</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="165"/> the Bishops of <HI>Rochester, Coventry</HI> and <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and <HI>Chester,</HI> to treat with Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> about a Peace. When the King came to meet with them in their return from this Negotiation, being at <HI>Woodstock,</HI> he was certified of the death of the Earl of <HI>Pembrock</HI> which he took so much to heart, that he presently melted into Tears, being afflicted for the death of so great a Person, whom he openly declared had not left his Second in all his Kingdom. Going from thence to <HI>Glocester,</HI> he met with the Archbishop and Bishops▪ who delivered to him the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> the Appendix.</NOTE> Form of the Treaty of Peace with Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> which he would not conclude, unless upon this condition; That all the <HI>English</HI> Nobility who were confederated with him, and by evil Counsel were exil'd, should be recalled, and restored to the King's Favour. The Archbishop further acquainted his Majesty, with what Difficulty he had brought the matter to this conclusion, being sometimes forced to add Threatnings on the King's behalf, with his Clergy; to which Menaces the Prince is said to have answered, That he bore more regard to the King's Charity and Piety, than he did fear his Arms, or dread his Clergy. But the King, who was very desirous of a Peace, readily consented to what the Prince required; and therefore he issued out his Letters, recalling all the Nobles who were out-law'd, or otherwise exil'd, requiring them to appear at <HI>Glo∣cester,</HI> upon <HI>Sunday</HI> next before <HI>Ascension day,</HI> where they should receive their Pardons, and be restored to their Estates, which the King had taken into his own hands.</P>
<P>The Peace being thus concluded betwixt the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Welch,</HI> Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> set his Son <HI>Gruffydh</HI> at liberty, whom for his disobedient and restless Hu∣mour he had detained in close Prison for the space of Six Years. About the same time, <HI>Cadwalhon ap Maelgon</HI> of <HI>Melienydh,</HI> departed this Life, who was quickly follow'd by <HI>Owen, Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI>'s Son, a Person of great Worth, and exceedingly beloved, and <MILESTONE N="1235" UNIT="A.D."/> was buried at <HI>Ystratflur,</HI> by his Brother <HI>Rhys.</HI> And the Year following dyed <HI>Owen ap Meredith ap Rotpert</HI>

About the same time also dyed <HI>John Scot,</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> without any Issue, upon which account the King seized that Earldom into his own hands. <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> was the first that enjoyed this Honour, who coming over to <HI>England</HI> with the Conquerour, was by him created Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> and Sword-bearer of <HI>England; Habendum &amp; tenendum dictum comitatum Cestriae, sibi &amp; haeredibus suis, ita liberè ad gladium, sicut ipse Rex totam tenebat Angliam ad coronam:</HI> To have and to hold the said County of <HI>Chester,</HI> to him and his Heirs by right of the Sword, so freely and securely as the King held the Realm of <HI>England</HI> in the right of the Crown. After Five De∣scents, <HI>Randulph Bohun</HI> came to be Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> who was Uncle to this <HI>John,</HI> the last Earl. This <HI>Randulph</HI> had several Encounters with Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn,</HI> and was in continual agitation against him; but once more particularly, meeting with the Prince, and being sensible of his Inability to withstand him, he was obliged to retire for Refuge to the Castle of <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> which the Prince presently besieged. <HI>Ran∣dulph</HI> perceiving himself to be in danger, sent to <HI>Ro∣ger Lacy,</HI> Constable of <HI>Chester,</HI> requesting him to raise what strength he could possible, and come to succour him in this Extremity. Wherefore <HI>Lacy</HI> having re∣ceived this Express, called to him presently all his
<PB N="258" REF="166"/> Friends, desiring them to make all the Endeavours imaginable to rescue the Earl from that imminent Danger which so severely threatned him: At whose request, <HI>Ralph Dutton,</HI> his Son in Law, a valorous Youth, assembled together all the Players and Musi∣cians, and such as then, being Fair-time, had met to make merry; and presenting them to the Constable, he forthwith marched to <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> raised the Siege, and delivered the Earl from all his fear. In recom∣pence of this Service, the Earl granted the Constable several Freedoms and Priviledges; and to <HI>Dutton</HI> the ruling and ordering all Players and Musicians within the said Country, to be enjoyed by his Heirs for ever.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1238" UNIT="A.D."/> In the Year 1238. Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> being discom∣posed in Body, called unto him all the Lords and Ba∣rons of <HI>Wales</HI> to <HI>Ystratflur,</HI> where each of them swore to remain true and faithful Subjects, and did Homage to <HI>David, Lhewelyn</HI>'s Son, whom he had named to succeed him. <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> writes, that Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> being impotent by reason of a Palsie, and sore disquieted by his Son <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> sent Embassadours to the King of <HI>England,</HI> signifying to him, that for as much as he could not expect to live long, by reason of his Age, he was desirous to lead the remainder of his days in Peace and Tranquility; and therefore now purposed to submit himself to the Government and Protection of the King, and would hold his Lands of him; promising withal, that whenever the King should stand in need of his help, he would serve him both with Men and Money, to the utmost of his power. The Bishops of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> were sent Mediators in this behalf, though some of the Nobility of <HI>Wales</HI> openly and peremptorily withstood it, and upon no condition whatsoever would accept of such a Peace. But <HI>David</HI> being declared Succes∣sor to the Principality, began to plague his Brother <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> who though elder, was yet base-born; and took from him <HI>Arustly, Ceri, Cyfeilioc, Mowdhwy, Moch∣nant,</HI> and <HI>Careneon;</HI> and let him only enjoy the <HI>Can∣tref</HI> of <HI>Lhyn.</HI> But a little afterwards he dispossessed him of all, and contrary to his Oath to the Bishop
<PB N="259" REF="166"/> of <HI>Bangor,</HI> in whose protection <HI>Gruffydh</HI> then remain∣ed, took him Prisoner; having upon promise of no Violence, obtained to speak with him, and sent him to <HI>Cricieth</HI> Castle. But whilst these two Brothers continued to entertain an irreconcilable Odium one to another, their Father, Prince <HI>Lewelyn ap Iorwerth,</HI><MILESTONE N="1240" UNIT="A.D."/> to the great Grief and Dissatisfaction of all the <HI>Welch,</HI> departed this Life, and was very honourably interred in the Abby of <HI>Conwey,</HI> after he had reigned Six and Fifty Years. He was a Prince of great Courage and Audacity, and had no less Prudence in contriving, than Boldness in executing any martial Adventure; he was a great Support to the <HI>Welch,</HI> and no less a Plague to the <HI>English;</HI> he made very considerable Conquests upon the Borders, and extended the Fron∣tiers of <HI>Wales,</HI> much beyond their former Limits. He had Issue by his only Wife <HI>Joan,</HI> Daughter to King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> one Son called <HI>David,</HI> who after∣wards succeeded in the Principality of <HI>Wales;</HI> and a Daughter named <HI>Gladys,</HI> who was married to Sir <HI>Ralph Mortimer.</HI> He had also a base Son, named <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> whom his Brother <HI>David</HI> kept a close Prisoner to his dying day.</P>

<P>PRince <HI>Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth</HI> being deceased, his only legitimate Son <HI>David,</HI> whom all the Ba∣rons of <HI>Wales</HI> had, as is said, in his Fathers Life∣time sworn to obey, legally succeeded in the Go∣verment; wherein being actually confirmed, he went to the King of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Glocester,</HI> and there did him Homage<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ap∣pendix.</HI></NOTE> for his Principality. Then all the Barons, both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welch</HI> who held any Lands in <HI>Wales,</HI> in like manner did Homage and Fealty for the same. But the <HI>English</HI> could not long refrain from their wonted Hostilities towards the <HI>Welch;</HI> and there∣upon
<PB N="260" REF="167"/> <HI>Gilbert Marshal,</HI> taking advantage of this Re∣volution, before Matters were throughly settled, brought an Army before the Castle of <HI>Aberteifi,</HI> which being delivered up to him, he fortified with a strong Garrison. Prince <HI>David</HI> was as yet too weak to ap∣pear in the Field; and indeed the more, by reason that several of his Nobility and others, could not affe∣ctionately love him, for that unnatural Spleen he shew'd to his Brother <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> whom, for no visible reason, he detained in close custody. But above the rest, <HI>Richard,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> stormed at the Prince, and finding that he violated his Promise, in setting his Brother at liberty, whom, under pretence of an ami∣cable Consultation he had fraudulently seized upon in the Bishop's presence, without more ado excommuni∣cated him; and then retiring to <HI>England,</HI> made a ve∣ry querimonious relation of the whole matter to the King, desiring him to release <HI>Gruffydh</HI> out of Prison, before the Rumour of so heinous a Fact should reach the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and so reflect upon his Majesty's Reputation. King <HI>Henry</HI> thereupon sent to his Ne∣phew, Prince <HI>David,</HI> blaming him highly for such a treacherous Action, and dealing so severely with his Brother; and then earnestly requested him to deliver <HI>Gruffydh</HI> out of custody, both to save himself from perpetual Defamation, and to deserve an Absolution from the severe Sentence pronounced against him, But <HI>David</HI> absolutely refused to comply to the King's desire, assuring him, that <HI>Wales</HI> could never enjoy a peaceable time, as long as his Brother <HI>Gruffydh</HI> had his liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Gruffydh</HI> being acquainted with his Brothers Reso∣lution, and thinking that thereby he had unavoidably displeased the King of <HI>England,</HI> privately sent to King <HI>Henry,</HI> assuring him, that if by Force he would deli∣ver him out of Prison, he would not only hold his Lands for ever from him, but also pay him the yearly Acknowledgment of Three Hundred Marks; offering both to give his corporal Oath, and to deliver up suf∣ficient Pledges for the performance of it; and with∣all to assist the King with all his Power in bringing in
<PB N="261" REF="167"/> the rest of the <HI>Welch</HI> to his subjection. Moreover, <HI>Gruffydh ap Madawc,</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield,</HI> positively as∣sured the King, that in case he would lead an Army into <HI>Wales,</HI> to revenge the Falsity and injurious Pra∣ctices of <HI>David,</HI> he would give him all possible Aid and Assistance. Indeed, King <HI>Henry,</HI> besides this so∣lemn Invitation, had no weak Pretence to come to <HI>Wales;</HI> for <HI>Richard,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> a fiery Man, had prosecuted the matter so warmly at <HI>Rome,</HI> that he obtained of the Pope also to excommunicate <HI>David,</HI> which Excommunication being denounced against him, his Lands were pretendedly forfeited But the King being chiefly allured with the Promises of the <HI>Welch</HI> in the behalf of <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> levied a very formi∣dable Army to lead to <HI>Wales;</HI> strictly commanding by Proclamation, all the <HI>English,</HI> who owed him any Martial-Service, to repair armed to <HI>Glocester,</HI> by the beginning of <HI>Autumn.</HI> This Rendezvouz being ac∣cordingly performed, the King came thither in per∣son at the time appointed, and having regulated his Troops, and put all Matters in convenient order, he marched to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> where he remained Fifteen Days to refresh his Army. During his stay there seve∣ral of the Nobility became Suitors unto him on behalf of <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> whose Condition they desired he would commiserate; among whom were, <HI>Ralph</HI> Lord <HI>Mor∣timer</HI> of <HI>Wigmore, Walter Clifford, Roger de Monte Alto,</HI> Steward of <HI>Chester, Maelgon ap Maelgon, Mere∣dith ap Rotpert</HI> Lord of <HI>Cydewen, Gruffydh ap Madawc</HI> of <HI>Bromfield, Howel</HI> and <HI>Meredith</HI> the Sons of <HI>Conan ap Owen Gwynedh,</HI> and <HI>Gruffydh ap Gwenwynwyn</HI> Lord of <HI>Powys.</HI> These Noblemen prevailed so far with King <HI>Henry,</HI> that a League was concluded be∣tween him and <HI>Senena</HI> the Wife of <HI>Gruffydh.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ap∣pendix.</HI></NOTE> For the performance of these Articles, the aforesaid No∣blemen offered to be Securities, and bound themselves by their several Writings. But as if all things had conspired together against Prince <HI>David,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ap∣pendix.</HI></NOTE> several Per∣sons that had been at continual variance and enmity among themselves to this time, were now, by reason that they equally favoured <HI>Gruffydh</HI>'s Cause, made
<PB N="662" REF="168"/> Friends among one another: <HI>Morgan ap Howel</HI> Lord of <HI>Cery,</HI> made his Reconciliation to Sir <HI>Ralph Morti∣mer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ap∣pendix.</HI></NOTE> and his Submission to King <HI>Henry,</HI> in a very so∣lemn manner: In the same form several others of the Nobility submitted to the King; as, <HI>Owen ap Howel, Maelgon ap Maelgon, Meredith ap Meredith, Howel ap Cadwalhon,</HI> and <HI>Cadwalhon ap Howel. David</HI> finding himself thus relinquished by the greatest part of his Nobility, and particularly by <HI>Gruffydh ap Madawc,</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield,</HI> whom he chiefly feared, by rea∣son of his great Wisdom and Power, and that he was much esteemed by the King of <HI>England,</HI> could not easily conclude how to carry himself in this perplexi∣ty of Affairs. But in fine, considering with himself what a puissant Army King <HI>Henry</HI> brought against him, and how himself was considerably weakened by the defection of his Subjects, he thought it most ad∣viseable to truckle to the King; and therefore with all speed sent him his Submission.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ap∣pendix.</HI></NOTE>Prince <HI>David</HI> having given a plenary Submission to the King, desired, that being his Nephew, and the lawful Heir and Successor of his Father Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn,</HI> he should enjoy the Principality of <HI>Wales,</HI> ra∣ther than <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> who was illegitimate, and in no wise related to the King; assuring him further, that the War would never be at an end, if he was set at liberty. King <HI>Henry</HI> knowing well the truth of all this, and withal being assured that <HI>Gruffydh</HI> was not only valiant himself, but had likewise very powerful Abettors and Promoters of his Cause, was very in∣clinable to assent to <HI>David</HI>'s Request, and to pre∣vent any farther Troubles, willingly granted it. Therefore <HI>David</HI> in a while after sent his Brother <HI>Gruffydh</HI> to the King, together with the Pledges pro∣mised for the performance of the Articles lately agreed upon; who were all sent to the Tower of <HI>London</HI> to be kept in safe custody; <HI>Gruffydh</HI> being allowed a Noble a day to provide himself with Necessaries. Shortly after, <HI>David</HI> came himself to <HI>London,</HI> and after he had done his Homage, and sworn Fealty to the King of <HI>England,</HI> returned to <HI>Wales,</HI> being ho∣nourably
<PB N="263" REF="168"/> and peaceably dismissed. But as soon as <HI>Gruffydh</HI> found out King <HI>Henry</HI>'s mind, and that it was the least part of his design to set him at liber∣ty, having flatly denyed the Bishop of <HI>Bangor</HI> his request therein; he began to set his Brains a working, and to devise a means whereby he might make his escape out of the Tower. Whereupon, having one night deceived his Keepers, he let himself down from the top of the Building, by a Line which he had composed out of the Sheets and Hangings of the Room; which being too weak to bear his weight, being a heavy corpulent Person, let him down head∣long to the ground; by the greatness of which Fall he was crushed to pieces, and so presently expired. King <HI>Henry</HI> being informed of this unhappy Acci∣dent, severely punished the Officers for their inexcu∣sable Carelesness; and ordered that his Son, who was kept Prisoner with him in the Tower, should be more narrowly observed.</P>
<P>After this King <HI>Henry</HI> fortified the Castle of <HI>Dyserth</HI> in <HI>Flintshire;</HI> and for their passed Service, or rather to oblige them to the like after, granted to <HI>Gruffydh ap Gwenwynwyn</HI> all his Estate in <HI>Powys,</HI> and to the Sons of <HI>Conan ap Owen Gwynedh</HI> their Lands in <HI>Me∣rionyth.</HI> And the next Year <HI>Maelgon Fychan</HI> fortifyed <MILESTONE N="1242" UNIT="A.D."/> the Castle of <HI>Garthgrugyn, John de Mynoc</HI> the Castle of <HI>Buelht,</HI> and <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> that of <HI>Melyenyth.</HI> But all these Preparations were not to no purpose; for the following Year early, King <HI>Henry</HI> came with <MILESTONE N="1243" UNIT="A.D."/> an Army into <HI>Wales,</HI> and began very unreasonably to molest the <HI>Welch,</HI> and without any just pretence for∣cibly to seize upon their Lands and Estates. Indeed, after the death of <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> he had a mind no longer to keep his Promise to <HI>David,</HI> and therefore entitled his eldest Son <HI>Edward</HI> to the Principality of <HI>Wales,</HI> whom he thought to oblige the <HI>Welch</HI> to obey. But Prince <HI>David</HI> understanding his design, levyed all his Power for the defence of his just Right; yet finding himself unable to withstand the Army of the <HI>English,</HI> purposed to effect that by Policy which he could not attain by Force. He sent therefore to the Pope,
<PB N="264" REF="169"/> complaining how that King <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>England</HI> com∣pelled him unjustly to hold his Lands of him, and that upon no legal pretence he seized the Estates of the <HI>Welch</HI> at his pleasure; telling him moreover, that Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> his Father had left him and the Prin∣cipality of <HI>Wales</HI> to the Protection of the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> to which he was willing to pay the yearly Sum of Five Hundred Marks, obliging himself and his Suc∣cessors by Oath, for the due performance of this Pay∣ment. The Pope (you may be sure) gladly accep∣ted of the Offer, and thereupon gave commission to the two Abbots of <HI>Aberconwey</HI> and <HI>Cymer,</HI> to absolve <HI>David</HI> from his Oath of Allegiance to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and having enquired into the whole Estate of the Quarrel, to transmit an account of it to him. The Abbots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ap∣pend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x.</HI></NOTE> according to their Commission, directed a very positive <HI>Mandat</HI> to the King of <HI>England.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> admiring the strange Presumption and Confidence of these Abbots, or more the unsatiable Avarice and Greediness of the Pope, sent also to <HI>Rome;</HI> and with a greater Sum of Money, easily ad∣justed all matters; his Holyness being very desirous to make the best advantage of both Parties.</P>
<P>But Prince <HI>David</HI> finding that the Pope minded his own Gain, more than to justifie his Complaints a∣gainst the King of <HI>England,</HI> thought it to no pur∣pose to rely upon his Faith, but judged it more ad∣visable to vindicate himself by force of Arms. Ha∣ving therefore gathered his Forces together, (being now reconciled to, and followed by all the Nobility of <HI>Wales,</HI> excepting <HI>Gruffydh ap Gwenwynwyn</HI> and <HI>Morgan ap Howel,</HI> who also shortly after submitted to him) he drew up his Army to the Marches, intend∣ing to be revenged upon the Earls of <HI>Clare</HI> and <HI>He∣reford, John de Monmouth, Roger de Monte Alto,</HI> and others, who injured and oppressed his People; with whom he fought divers times, and with various suc∣cess. <MILESTONE N="1245" UNIT="A.D."/> But in the <HI>Lent</HI>-time next Year, the <HI>Marchers</HI> and the <HI>Welch</HI> met near <HI>Montgomery,</HI> between whom was fought a very severe Battel; the Governour of that Castle being General of the <HI>English,</HI> and having

<P>But concerning this Expedition to <HI>Wales,</HI> and the continuance of the <HI>English</HI> Army therein, a certain Person in the Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

But in their return back, our Soldiers being too covetous and greedy of Plunder, among other sacrilegious and profane Actions, spoiled the Abbey of <HI>Aberconwey,</HI> and burnt all the Books and other choice Utensils belonging to it. The <HI>Welch</HI> being distracted at these irreligious Pra∣ctices, got together in great number, and in a de∣sperate manner setting upon the <HI>English,</HI> killing a great number of them, and following the rest to the Water-side, forced as many as could not make their escape into the Boats, to commit themselves to the mercy of the Waves. Those they took Pri∣soners they thought to reserve for exchange; but hearing how we put some of their captive Nobi∣lity to death, they altered their minds, and in a revengeful manner scattered their dilacerated Car∣casses along the surface of the Water. In this Conflict, we lost a considerable number of our Men, and chiefly those under the Command of

In the mean time Sir <HI>Walter Bisset</HI> stout∣ly defended the Ship till Midnight, when the Tide returned; whereupon the <HI>Welch,</HI> who assailed us of all sides, were forced to withdraw, being much concerned that we had so happily escaped their hands.</Q> The Cargo of this Ship, were Three Hun∣dred Hogsheads of Wine, with a plenty of other Provision for the Army, which at that time it stood in very great need of. But the next Morning, when the Sea was returned, the <HI>Welch</HI> came mer∣rily down again to the Ship, thinking to surprize our Men; but as Luck would have it, they had at full Sea the Night before relinquished the Ship, and returned safe to the Camp. The Enemy missing of our Men, set upon the Cargo of the Ship, carryed away all the Wine and other Provisions; and then when the Sea began to slow, they put Fire to the Vessel, and returned to the rest of the Army. And thus we lay incamped in great Misery and Di∣stress for want of Necessaries, exposed to great and frequent Dangers, and in great fear of the private Assaults and sudden Incursions of our Enemies. Oftentimes we set upon and assailed the <HI>Welch,</HI> and in one Conflict we carried away a Hundred Head of Cattel, which very triumphantly we convey∣ed to our Camp. For the scarcity of Provision was then so great, that there remained but one Hogshead of Wine in the whole Army; a Bushel of Corn being sold for Twenty Shillings; a fed Ox for Three or Four Marks; and a Hen for Eight Pence; so that there happened a very lamentable Mortality both of Man and Horse, for want of necessary Sustenance of Life.</P>

<P>But <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> was not satisfied with the loss of <HI>Buelht,</HI> and therefore was resolved to try ro recover it; to which end, he went to the King of <HI>England,</HI> of whom he obtained a very strong Army, com∣manded by one <HI>Stephen Bacon,</HI> which being sent by Sea, landed at <HI>Caermardhyn</HI> in the <HI>Whitsun</HI>-Week.

But as soon as he was arrived, great Complaints were exhibited to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> against <HI>Jeffrey Langley</HI> Lieutenant to <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> who without any regard to Equity and Conscience, most wrongfully oppressed the Inhabitants of <HI>Wales</HI> under his Jurisdiction.

Upon this the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land</HI> sent to <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> requiring him to cease from Ho∣stility, and after that unmerciful manner to devour, and forcibly to take away other Mens Estates. The Prince was not over sollicitous to hearken to their Request, but finding the time of the year very sea∣sonable for Action against the <HI>English,</HI> he divided his Army into two Battles, each of these consisting of 1500 Foot and 500 Horse, with which he purposed to enlarge his Conquest. <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> to prevent the Blow which so desperately hung over his Head, sent over for Succors from <HI>Ireland,</HI> of whose coming Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> being certified, manned out a Fleet to intercept them, which meeting with the <HI>Irish</HI> at Sea, after a sharp Dispute, forced them to return back with loss. King <HI>Henry</HI> being acquaint∣ed with the miscarriage of the <HI>Irish,</HI> resolved to come in Person against the <HI>Welch,</HI> and having drawn together the whole Strength of <HI>England,</HI> even from St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Mount in <HI>Cornwal</HI> to the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> marched with his Son <HI>Edward</HI> in a great Rage to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and without any opposition advanced as far as <HI>Teganwy.</HI> But the Prince had stopped his farther Progress, and prevented any long stay he could make in <HI>Wales,</HI> having before hand caused all
<PB N="275" REF="174"/> manner of Provision and Forrage to be carried over the River, and then securing the strait and narrow Passages whereby the <HI>English</HI> might get on farther into the Country, the Army was in a short time so mor∣tally fatigued, that the King for want of necessary Subsistance was forced to retire in haste to <HI>England</HI> with considerable loss.</P>
<P>The Prince after that sending for all the Forces in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> came to the Marches, where <HI>Gruffydh</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield</HI> finding that the King of <HI>England</HI> was not able to defend his Estate yielded himself up, and then passing to <HI>Powys,</HI> he banished <HI>Gruffydh ap Gwenwynwyn,</HI> and took all the Lands in the Country into his Hands.

But within a while after, it sat at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where King <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> his Son took a Solemn Oath to observe the Laws and Sta∣tutes of the Realm, and the same being tendred to <HI>Guy</HI> and <HI>William</HI> the King's Brothers, and to <HI>Henry</HI> Son to the King of <HI>Almain,</HI> and to Earl <HI>Warren,</HI> they refused to take it and so departed. In this Par∣liament
<PB N="277" REF="175"/> the Lords of <HI>Wales</HI> fairly proffered to be try∣ed by the Laws for any Offence they had unjustly commirted against the King, which was mainly op∣posed by <HI>Edward,</HI> who caused one <HI>Patrick de Canton</HI> (to whom the Lordship of <HI>Cydwely</HI> was given, in case he could win and keep the same) to be sent to <HI>Caer∣mardhyn</HI> as Lieutenant for the King, with whom <HI>Me∣redith ap Rhys</HI> was joyned in Commission.

But <HI>Patrick</HI> meaning no such thing, laid an ambuscade for the <HI>Welch,</HI> who coming honest∣ly forward, were by the way villanously set upon by the <HI>English,</HI> and a great many slain; but those that happily escaped, calling up the Country, present∣ly gave chase to <HI>Patrick</HI> and his Accomplices, who being at length overtaken▪ were almost all put to the Sword.

<P>There being no hopes of a Peace, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI><MILESTONE N="1260" UNIT="A.D."/> early next year appeared in the Field, and passed to <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and first fell foul upon Sir <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger Mor∣timer,</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="176"/> who contrary to his Oath, maintained the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Quarrel. Having forcibly dispossessed him of all <HI>Buelht,</HI> and without any opposition taken the Castle, where was found a plentiful Magazine, he marched thro' all <HI>South-Wales,</HI> confirming his Con∣quest, and afterwards returned to his Palace at <HI>Aber,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1261" UNIT="A.D."/> betwixt <HI>Bangor</HI> and <HI>Conwey.</HI> The year following, <MILESTONE N="1262" UNIT="A.D."/><HI>Owen ap Meredith</HI> Lord of <HI>Cydewen</HI> died. But the next Summer was somewhat more noted for Action, a party of Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>'s Men took by surprise the Castle of <HI>Melienyth</HI> belonging to Sir <HI>Roger Mor∣timer▪</HI> and having put the rest of the Garrison to the Sword, they took <HI>Howel ap Meyric</HI> the Governour with his Wife and Children Prisoners; and after that, the Castle was demolished by the Prince's Order.

The Prince upon the ac∣count of Relation and near Consanguinity betwixt them, and withal because he would not be so mean spirited as to fall upon an Enemy, who had no power to resist him, let him safely depart with his Forces, and then passing on himself to <HI>Brecknock</HI> at the request of the People of that Country, who swore Fidelity unto him; so passed on and returned to <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th-Wales.</HI> And now being Confederate with the Barons against King <HI>Henry,</HI> he was resolved to practise something in the prejudice of the <HI>English,</HI> and so set upon the Earldom of <HI>Chester,</HI> destroyed the Castles of <HI>Tygann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> and <HI>Diserth</HI> belonging to <HI>Edward,</HI> who coming thi∣ther, was yet not able to prevent the Mischief done <MILESTONE N="1263" UNIT="A.D."/> to him by the <HI>Welch.</HI> The next year <HI>John Strange Junior,</HI> Constable of <HI>Montgomery</HI> with a great Num∣ber of Marchers, came a little before <HI>Easter</HI> by night, thro' <HI>Ceri</HI> to <HI>Cydewen,</HI> intending to surprise the Castle, which when the People of the Country understood, they gathered together, and setting upon them, slew 200 of his Men, but <HI>Strange</HI> with a few got safely back.</P>

<P>Within a while after, the Marchers and the <HI>Welch</HI> met again near a place called <HI>Clun,</HI> where a hot En∣gagement happened between them, in which the <HI>Welch</HI> were worsted, and had a great Number of their Men slain. After this, nothing remarkable fell out for a considerable time, unless it were, that <HI>David</HI> being released out of Prison by Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> his Brother, most ungratefully forsook him, and with all his might, sided with his Enemies the <HI>English;</HI> also <HI>Gruffydh ap Gwenwynwyn</HI> having taken the Castle of <HI>Mold,</HI> demolished it to the ground. During this quiet and unactive interval in <HI>Wales, Meredith ap Owen,</HI> the main Support and Defender of <HI>South-Wales</HI> died, to the great disadvantage of the Affairs of that Coun∣try. And now indeed, the <HI>Welch</HI> were like to be <MILESTONE N="1268" UNIT="A.D."/> made sensible of the Loss of so considerable a Person, for King <HI>Henry</HI> was resolved once more to lead an Army into <HI>Wales,</HI> and to see if he could have better Success than he had hitherto against the <HI>Welch.</HI> But when he was prepared to undertake this Expedition, <HI>Ottobonus</HI> Pope <HI>Clement</HI>'s Legate in <HI>England,</HI> interposed and mediated a Peace, which was concluded upon at the Castle of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> wherein it was articled, that Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> should give the King 30000 Marks, and the King was to grant the Prince a Char∣ter, from thenceforth to receive Homage and Fealty of all the Nobility and Barons of <HI>Wales,</HI> besides one, so that they could hold their Lands of no other but himself, and from thence forward he was to be law∣fully stiled Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> This Charter being ra∣tified and confirmed as well by the Authority of the Pope, as the King's Seal; Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> desisted from any farther Acts of Hostility, and punctually observed all the Articles of Agreement betwixt him and King <HI>Henry,</HI> so that nothing more was out∣ragiously transacted between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welch,</HI> during the remainder of this King's reign. Within that space, died <HI>Grono ap Ednyfed Fychan,</HI> one of the Chief Lords of the Prince's Council, and shortly after him, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield,</HI> who lies buried at <HI>Vale-Crucis.</HI></P>

<P><HI>WE would have your Lordships to understand, that whereas formerly most terrible and incessant Wars were continually managed betwixt</HI> Henry <HI>King of</HI> England <HI>and our self; the same were at last composed, and all matters of Differences were adjusted by the means of his Excellency Cardinal</HI> Ottobonus <HI>the Pope's Legate, who having drawn the Articles and Conditions of the Peace agre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon, they were signed and swore to, not only by the K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, but also the Prince his Son, now King of</HI> England. <HI>Among these Articles were comprehended, that we and our Successors should hold of the King and his Successor the Principality of</HI> Wales, <HI>so that all the</HI> Welch <HI>Lords, one Baron excepted, should hold their Baronies and Estates</HI> in Capite <HI>of us, and should pay their Homage and Fealty for the same to us; we in like manner doing Homage to the King of</HI> England <HI>and his Successors. And besides, that the King and his Successors should never offer to receive and entertain any of our Enemies, nor any such of our own Subjects as were lawfully banished and excluded our Dominions of</HI> Wales, <HI>nor by any means defend and up∣hold such against us. Contrary to which Articles, King</HI> Edward <HI>has forcibly seized upon the Estates of certain Barons of</HI> Wales, <HI>of which they and their Ancestors have been immemorably possessed of, and detains a Barony, which by the form of Peace should have been delivered to us; and moreover, has hitherto entertained</HI> David
<PB N="282" REF="178"/> ap Gruffydh <HI>our Brother, and</HI> Gruffydh ap Gwen∣wynwyn, <HI>with several others of our Enemies who are Out-laws and Fugitives of our Country. And tho' we have often exhibited our Grievances and Complaints a∣gainst them, for destroying and pillaging our Country, yet we could never obtain of the King any relief or redress for the several Wrongs and Injuries we re∣ceived at their hands; but on the contrary they still persist to commit wastes and other outrages in our Do∣minions. And for all this, he summons us to do him Homage at a place which is altogether dangerous to our Person, where our inveterate Enemies, and which is worse, our own unnatural Subjects, bear the greatest sway and respect w th the King. And tho' we have alledged several Reasons to the King and his Council, why the place by him assigned, is n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t safe and indif∣ferent for us to come, and desire him to appoint ano∣ther, whereto we might with more safety resort, or else that he would send Commissioners to receive our Oath and Homage, till he could more opportunely receive them in Person; yet he would not assent to our just and reasonable Request, nor be satisfied with the Rea∣sons we exhibited for our non-appearance. Therefore we desire your Lordships earnestly to weigh the dismal effects that will happen to the Subjects both of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Wales <HI>upon the breach of the Articles of Peace, and that you would be pleased to inform the King of the sad Consequence of another War, which can no way be prevented, but by using us according to the Condi∣tions of the former Peace, which for our part, we will in no measure transgress. But if the King will not hearken to your Counsel, we hope that you will h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld us excused, if the Nation be disquieted and troubled there∣upon, which as much as in us lieth we endeavour to prevent.</HI></P>

<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> would admit of no Excuse, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearken to any manner of Reason in the case, but was unmercifully enraged, and conceived an unpar∣donable displeasure against Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> which yet he thought convenient to conceal and dissemble

Indeed, he could never abide <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce the time that he was vanquished and put to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight by him at the Marches, so that the chief Cause <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f King <HI>Edward</HI>'s anger, originally proceeded from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> point of Honor, which this refusal of Homage <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rved sufficiently to increase. But to prosecute his Revenge, which upon this score is in Princes very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erce and unforgetful, in a short time he came to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hester,</HI> meaning to recover by force what he could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot obtain by fair means.

<P>Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> hearing of this, and finding his own Subjects to forsake him, but more especially be∣ing desirous to recover his espouse the Lady <HI>Eleanor,</HI> thought it likewise advisable to submit, and therefore sued to King <HI>Edward</HI> for a Peace, who granted it, but upon very severe Conditions upon <HI>Lhewelyns</HI> side. The Agreement consisted of ten Articles, which were, 1. That the Prince should set at liberty all manner of Prisoners, that upon the King's Account were de∣tained in Custody. 2. That for the King's favour and good will, he should pay 50000 Marks▪ to be re∣ceived at the King's pleasure. 3. That these four Cantreds or Hundreds, <HI>viz. Cantref Ros</HI> where the King's Castle of <HI>Teganwy</HI> stands; <HI>Ryfonioc,</HI> where <HI>Denbigh; Tegengl,</HI> where <HI>Ruthlan; Dyffryn Clwyd,</HI> where <HI>Rhuthyn</HI> stands, should remain in the King's hands. 4. That the Lords Marchers should quietly enjoy all the Lands they had conquered within <HI>Wales,</HI> excepting in the Isle of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> which was wholly granted to the Prince. 5. That in consideration of this Island, the Prince should pay 5000 Marks in hand, with the reserve of a 1000 Marks yearly to be∣gin at <HI>Michaelmas;</HI> and in case the Prince died with∣out Issue, the whole Island should return to the King. 6. That the Prince should come every year to <HI>England</HI> to pay his Homage to the King for all his Lands. 7. That all the Barons of <HI>Wales,</HI> excepting five in <HI>Snowden,</HI> should hold their Lands and Estates of the King, and no other. 8. That the Title of Prince should remain only for his Life, and not descend to his Successors, and after his Death, the five Lords of <HI>Snowden</HI> should hold their Lands only from the King. 9. That for the performance of these Articles, the Prince should deliver up for Hostages ten Persons of the best Quality in the Country, without imprison∣ing, disinheriting, and any time of redemption de∣termined. And farther, that the King should chuse Twenty Persons within <HI>North-Wales,</HI> who besides the Prince, should take their Oaths for the due perfor∣mance of these Articles, and in case the Prince should swerve and recede from them, and upon admonition
<PB N="285" REF="179"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereof not repent, they should forsake him, and be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome his Enemies. 10. The Prince was obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffer his Brethren quietly to enjoy their Lands in <HI>Wales,</HI> whereof <HI>David</HI> for his Service was dubbed Knight by the King, and had the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI>'s Widow given him in Matrimony, and with her as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Portion, the Castle of <HI>Denbigh</HI> in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides a 1000 Pounds in Lands.

<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> having imposed these severe and un∣merciful Conditions upon Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> and for a better security for the performance of them, built a Castle at <HI>Aberystwyth,</HI> returned very honourably into <HI>England;</HI> upon whose arrival, the People wil∣lingly granted him a Subsidy of the Twentieth part of their Estates towards his Charges in this War. But it seems very probable that Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> submitted to these intolerable Conditions, more up∣on the account of his Amours, and to regain the Lady <HI>Eleanora</HI> out of the King of <HI>England</HI>'s hand, than that he was apprehensive of any considerable Danger he might receive by the <HI>English</HI> Troops. For it is hardly conceivable, that a Prince of such notorious Conduct and Valour, would so easily ac∣cept of such hard Terms, and in a measure deliver up his Principality, when there was no necessity so to do, without resisting an Enemy, whom he had frequently overcome, and forced to retire back with greater inequality than the <HI>English</HI> had at present over him. But the force of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove worked Won∣ders, and in this case▪ proved mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t irresistible, which to obtain, <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> did not think hard to forfeit his proper Right to his inveterate Enemies, and for ever to exclude his Posterity from succeed∣ing in their lawful Inheritance. The next year <MILESTONE N="1273" UNIT="A.D."/> therefore, he had his Wish accomplished, and was married to <HI>Eleanora</HI> at <HI>Worcester,</HI> the King and Queen, with all the Nobility and Persons of Quality in <HI>England,</HI> honouring the Wedding with their p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣sence.</P>

At the same time, <HI>Rhys ap Maelgon</HI> and <HI>Gruffydh ap Meredith ap Owen,</HI> with other Lords of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> took from the <HI>English</HI> the Castle of <HI>Aberystwyth,</HI> with divers others in that Country, and spoiled all the People thereabouts, who owned subjection to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> In the mean while, <HI>John Peckham</HI> Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> perceiving how matters were like to proceed between the King and the Prince, and how the Kingdom was effectually involved in a War, of his own proper motion came to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> to endeavour a re-submission from him and his Bro∣ther <HI>David</HI> to King <HI>Edward,</HI> and so to put a stop to any farther Hostilities.</P>
<PB N="287" REF="180"/>
<P>But he sent before-hand to the Prince and Peo∣ple of <HI>Wales,</HI> intimating to them, <Q REND="margQuotes">That for the Love he bore to the <HI>Welch</HI> Nation, he under∣took this Arbitration, without the knowledg, and contrary to the King's liking; and therefore ear∣nestly desired, that they would submit to a Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> which himself would endeavour to bring to pass. And because he could make no long continuance in those Parts, he wished them to consider, how that if he should be forced to depart before any thing was brought to a con∣clusion, they could hardly find another who would so heartily espouse their Cause; and farther threat∣ned, that in case they contemned and derided his Endeavours, he would not only instigate the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Army, now greatly strengthned and increased, to fall upon them, but also signifie their Stubborn∣ness to the Court and Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> who e∣steemed and honoured <HI>England,</HI> beyond any other Kingdom in the World. Moreover, he much la∣mented to hear of the excessive Cruelty of the <HI>Welch,</HI> even beyond that of the <HI>Saracens</HI> and other Infidels, who never refused to permit Slaves and Captives to be ransomed; which the <HI>Welch</HI> were so far from practising, that even some time they slew those for whose Redemption they received Money. And whereas they were wont to esteem and reverence holy and ecclesiastical Persons, they are now so far degenerated from Devotion and Sanctity, that nothing is more acceptable to them than War and Sedition, which they had now great need to forsake and repent of. Lastly, he proposed, that they would signifie to him, where∣in, and what Laws and Constitutions of theirs was violated by the <HI>English,</HI> and by what means a firm and a lasting Peace might be esta∣blished; which, if they rejected, they must ex∣pect to incur the Decree and Censure of the Church, as well as endure the violent In-roads and Depredations of a powerful Army.</Q> To these, partly Admonitions, and partly Threatnings of the
<PB N="288" REF="181"/> Archbishop, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> returned an Answer; <Q REND="margQuotes">That he humbly thanked his Grace for the Pains and Trouble he undertook in his and his Subjects behalf; and more particularly, because he would venture to come to <HI>Wales,</HI> contrary to the plea∣sure and good liking of the King. And as for concluding a Peace with him, he would not have his Grace be ignorant, that with all readiness he was willing to submit to it, upon condition that the King would duly and sincerely observe the same. And though he would be glad of his lon∣ger <MILESTONE N="1201" UNIT="A.D."/> continuance in <HI>Wales,</HI> yet he hoped that no Obstructions would happen of his side, why a Peace (which of all things he most desired) might not be forthwith concluded, and rather by his Graces procuring than any others; so that there would be no farther need of acquainting the Pope with his Obstinacy, nor moving the King of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> to use any Force against him. And though the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> be under the immediate Protection of the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet, when his Ho∣liness comes to understand of the great and unsuf∣ferable Wrongs done to him by the <HI>English;</HI> how the Articles of Peace were broken, Churches and all other religious Houses in <HI>Wales</HI> were burn∣ed down and destroyed, and religious Persons un∣christianly murthered, he hoped he would rather pity and lament his Condition, than with addition of Punishment increase and augment his Sorrow. Neither shall the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> be any wise disquieted and molested by his means, in case the Peace be religiously observed towards him and his Subjects. But who they are, that delight them∣selves with War and Bloodshed, manifestly ap∣pears by their Actions and Behaviour; the <HI>We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch</HI> being glad to live quietly upon their own, if they might be permitted by the <HI>English,</HI> who coming to the Country, utterly destroy whatever comes in their way, without regard either to Sex, Age, or religious places. But he was extreme sorry that any one should be slain, having paid his R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>; the
<PB N="289" REF="181"/> Author of which unworthy Action he did not pretend to maintain, but would inflict upon him his condign Punishment, in case he could be got out of the Woods and Desarts, where as an Outlaw, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he lives undiscovered. But as to com∣mencing a War in a Season inconvenient, he pro∣tested he knew nothing of that till now; yet those that did so, do solemnly attest that to be the only measure they had to save themselves, and that they had no other security for their Lives and Fortunes, than to keep themselves in Arms. Concerning his Sins and Trespasses against God, with the assistance of his Grace, he would endea∣vour to repent of; neither should the War be willingly continued by him, in case he might save himself harmless; but before he would be unjustly dispossessed of his legal Propriety, he thought it but reasonable, by all possible measures to defend himself. And he was very willing, upon due Exa∣mination of the Trespasses committed, to make Satisfaction and Retribution of all Wrongs com∣mitted by him and his Subjects; so that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> would observe the same of their side; and like∣wise was ready to conclude a Peace, which he thought was impossible to be established, as long as the <HI>English</HI> had no regard to Articles, and still oppress his People with new and unwarrantable Exactions. Therefore seeing his Subjects were un∣christianly abused by the King's Officers, and all his Country most tyrannically harassed, he saw no reason why the <HI>English,</HI> upon any fault of his side, should threaten to bring a formidable Army to his Country, nor the Church pretend to censure him; seeing also, he was very willing upon the afore∣said Conditions, to submit to a Peace. And lastly, he desired his Grace, that he would not give the more credit to his Enemies, because they were near his Person, and could deliver their Complaints frequently, and by word of mouth; for they who made no conscience of oppressing, would not in all probability, stick to defame, and make false Ac∣cusations;
<PB N="290" REF="182"/> and therefore his Grace would make a better Estimation of the whole matter, by examin∣ing their Actions, rather than believing their Words.</Q></P>
<P>Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> having to this purpose replyed in general to the Archbishops Articles, presented him with a Copy of the several Grievances, which him∣self and others of his Subjects had wrongfully and unjustly received at the hands of the <HI>English.</HI> And these, though somewhat tedious, are thought neces∣sary to be particularly inserted in the Appendix, by reason that they demonstrably vindicate the <HI>Welch</HI> Nation, from the unreasonable Aspersions which the <HI>English</HI> of these times cast upon it. For, the breach of Peace, and the occasion of those dismal Disturban∣ces in the Kingdom, are, by the <HI>English</HI> Writers of those times, wholly attributed to the restless and rebellious Humour and unconstant Temper of the <HI>Welch▪</HI> Whereas, had they looked at home, they might have found the Original of all these Troubles, to have proceeded from the intolerable Extortions and insupportable Oppressions of their own Nation. For whoever considers these unmerciful Grievances, and the manifold Wrongs the <HI>Welch</HI> endured, it can∣not in reason be expected, but that they would endea∣vour to vindicate themselves, and repel Force by Force. For, had the <HI>English</HI> the liberty of dispossessing them wrongfully of their proper Inheritance and Estates, and it was not lawful for the <HI>Welch</HI> to endeavour the defending and keeping their own? And must they be reckoned disobedient, and Promoters of Se∣dition, upon the account that they would not be trampled under, and enslaved by the <HI>English?</HI> These Measures were too hard and intolerable, and scarce allowable in an Infidel Nation; to oppress, (and what in them lay) eradicate a People, for no other reason, than because they were weaker and more helpless than themselves; and then, what is worse, to accuse them of being Authors of Sedition, be∣cause they would not suffer themselves to be peace∣ably enslaved, but endeavoured to vindicate their Right by main Force. But it is highly probable,
<PB N="291" REF="182"/> that King <HI>Edward</HI> had no inclination to observe, what Articles of Agreement soever were concluded upon; and therefore encouraged his Deputies in the Marches and inland Country of <HI>Wales,</HI> in all their Oppressions and sinistrous Dealings towards the <HI>Welch.</HI> This was the best Method, and the most expedient Means to reduce the Country of <HI>Wales</HI> to subjection to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> which the King had long ago intentionally effected: And to accuse the <HI>Welch</HI> of not observing the Conditions of Peace, was a specious Pretence to bring that a∣ctually to pass, and to lead an Army into the Coun∣try. But whaever the <HI>English</HI> might pretend, 'tis evi∣dent the <HI>Welch</HI> had the greater occasion to complain,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> the Appendix.</NOTE> as appears from the Grievances committed as well against the Prince himself, as others of his Subjects.</P>
<P>The Archbishop having read over these Grievances, and finding the <HI>Welch</HI> to be upon good reason guilt∣less of that severe Character, which by the malici∣ous Insinuations of the <HI>English,</HI> he had conceived of them, went to King <HI>Edward;</HI> requesting him to take into consideration the unjust Wrongs and Inju∣ries done to the <HI>Welch;</HI> which if he would not re∣dress, at least he might excuse them from any breach of Obedience to him, seeing they had so just a rea∣son for what they did. The King replyed, That he willingly forgave them, and would make reasonable Satisfaction for any Wrong done; so that they had free access to declare their Greivances before him; and then might safely depart, in case it would ap∣pear just and lawful they should. The Archbishop upon this thought he had obtained his purpose, and therefore, without any stay, posted it to <HI>Snowden,</HI> where the Prince and his Brother <HI>David</HI> resided; and having acquainted them with the King's mind, ear∣nestly desired that they, and the rest of the Nobility of <HI>Wales,</HI> would submit themselves, and by him be introduced to the King's presence. Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> after some times Conference and Debate, declared that he was ready to submit to the King, with the reserve only of two particulars; namely, his Consci∣ence,
<PB N="292" REF="183"/> whereby he was obliged to regard the Safety and Liberties of his People; and then the decency of his own State and Quality. But the King under∣standing by the Archbishop, how that the Prince stood upon Terms, positively refused to consent to any more Treaty of Peace, than that he should sim∣ply submit, without any farther Conditions. The Archbishop had experience enough, that the <HI>Welch</HI> would never agree to such Proposals; and therefore desired of his Majesty, that he would give him leave, with the rest of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility present, to confer and conclude upon the matter; which be∣ing granted, they unanimously resolved upon the fol∣lowing Articles, and sent them to the Prince by <HI>John Wallensis,</HI> Bishop of S. <HI>Davids.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>The King will have no Treaty of the four Can∣treds, and other Lands which he has bestow∣ed upon his Nobles; nor of the Isle of</HI> Ang∣lesey.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>In case the Tenants of the four Cantreds sub∣mit themselves, the King purposeth to deal kindly and honourably with them; which we are sufficiently satisfied of, and will, what in us lyes, endeavour to further.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>We will do the like touching Prince</HI> Lhewelyn, <HI>concerning whom we can return no other An∣swer, than that he must barely submit him∣self to the King, without hopes of any other Conditions.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These were the publick Articles agreed upon by the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, and sent to Prince <HI>Lhewelyn;</HI> besides which, they sent some private Measures of Agreement, relating both to him and his Brother <HI>Da∣vid;</HI> promising, that in case he would submit, and put the King in quiet possession of <HI>Snowden,</HI> his Ma∣jesty would bestow an <HI>English</HI> County upon him, with the yearly Revenue of a Thousand Pound Ster∣ling. And moreover, his Daughter should be pro∣vided for, suitable to her Birth and Quality, and all
<PB N="293" REF="183"/> his Subjects according to their Estate and Condi∣tion; and in case he should have Male Issue by a second Wife, the aforesaid County and a Thousand Pound should remain to his Posterity for ever. As for <HI>David</HI> the Prince's Brother, if he would consent to go to the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> upon condition not to re∣turn but upon the King's Pleasure, all things should be honourably prepared for his Journey with respect to his Quality; and his Child maintain'd and pro∣vided for by the King. To these the Archbishop added his Threats; That in case they did not com∣ply, and submit themselves to the King's Mercy, there were very severe and imminent Dangers hang∣ing over their Heads; a formidable Army was ready to make an inroad into their Country, which would not only gaul and oppress them, but in all proba∣bility totally eradicate the whole Nation: Besides which, they were to expect the severest Censure and Punishment of the Church.</P>
<P>But all this could not force so unlimited a Sub∣mission from the Prince, but that he would stick up∣on some certain Conditions; and therefore by Let∣ter he acquainted the Archbishop, <Q REND="margQuotes">That he was with all willingness desirous to submit himself to the King; but withal, that he could not do it but in such a manner as was safe and honest for him. And because the Form of Submission contained in the Articles sent to him, were by himself and his Council thought pernicious and illegal for him to consent to as tending rather to the Destruction, than the Security of himself and his Subjects, he could in no wise agree to it; and in case himself should be willing, the rest of his Nobility and People would never admit of it, as knowing for certain the Mis∣chief and Inconveniency that would ensue thereby. Therefore he desired his Lordship, that for a Con∣firmation of an honest and a durable Peace, which he had all this while earnestly laboured for, he would manage Matters circumspectly, and with due regard to the following Articles. For it was much more honourable for the King, and far more
<PB N="294" REF="184"/> consonant to Reason, that he should hold his Lands in the Country where he was born and dwelt in, than that by dispossessing of him, his Estate should be bestowed upon Strangers.</Q> With this was sent the general Answer of the <HI>Welch</HI> to the Archbishop's Articles, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Though the King would not consent to treat of the four Cantreds, nor of the Isle of <HI>Anglesey;</HI> yet unless these be comprehended in the Treaty, the Prince's Council will not conclude a Peace; by rea∣son that these Cantreds have ever, since the time of <HI>Camber</HI> the Son of <HI>Brutus,</HI> properly and legally be∣longed to the Princes of <HI>Wales;</HI> besides the Confir∣mation which the present Prince obtained by the Consent of the King and his Father, at the Treaty before Cardinal <HI>Ottobonus</HI> the Pope's Legate, whose Letters Patents do still appear. And more, the Ju∣stice of the thing it self is plainly evident, that it is more reasonable for our Heirs to hold the said Can∣treds for Money, and other Services due to the King, than that Strangers enjoy the same, who will forci∣bly abuse and oppress the People.</P>
<P N="2">2. All the Tenants of the Cantreds of <HI>Wales</HI> do unanimously declare, that they dare not submit them∣selves to the King's Pleasure; by reason that he ne∣ver from the beginning took care to observe either Covenant, Oath, or any other Grant to the Prince and his People; and because his Subjects have no re∣gard to Religion, but most cruelly and unchristianly tyranize over Churches and religious Persons; and then, for that we do not understand our selves any way obliged thereunto, seeing we be the Princes Tenants, who is willing to pay the King all usual and accustomed Services.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to what is required, that the Prince should simply commit himself to the King's Will, we all de∣clare, that for the aforesaid Reasons, none of us dare come, neither will we permit our Prince to come to him upon those Conditions.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="295" REF="184"/>4. That some of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility will endea∣vour to procure a provision of a Thousand Pounds a Year in <HI>England;</HI> we would let them know, that we can accept of no such Pension; because it is procured for no other end, than that the Prince being disinherited, themselves may obtain his Lands in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Prince cannot in honesty resign his pater∣nal Inheritance, which has for many Ages been en∣joyed by his Predecessours, and accept of other Lands among the <HI>English,</HI> of whose Customs and Language he is ignorant; and upon that score, may at length be fraudulently deprived of all, by his malicious and inveterate Enemies.</P>
<P N="6">6. Seeing the King intends to deprive him of his antient Inheritance in <HI>Wales,</HI> where the Land is more barren and untilled; it is not very probable that he will bestow upon him, a more fruitful and an a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Estate in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. As to the Clause, that the Prince should give the King a perpetual Possession of <HI>Snowden;</HI> we only affirm, that seeing <HI>Snowden</HI> essentially belongs to the Principality of <HI>Wales,</HI> which the Prince and his Pre∣decessors have enjoyed since <HI>Brute,</HI> the Prince's Coun∣cil will not permit him to renounce it, and accept another Estate in <HI>England,</HI> to which he has not equal Right.</P>
<P N="8">8. The People of <HI>Snowden</HI> declare, That though the Prince should give the King possession of it, they would never own, and pay Submission to Strangers; for in so doing, they would bring upon themselves the same Misery, that the People of the Four Can∣treds have for a long time groaned under; being most rudely handled and unjustly oppressed by the King's Officers; as wofully appears by their several Grievances.</P>
<P N="9">9. As for <HI>David,</HI> the Prince's Brother, we see no reason, why against his Will he should be compell'd to take a Journey to the <HI>Holy-Land;</HI> which if he happens to undertake hereafter upon the account of Religion, it is no cause that his Issue should be disin∣herited, but rather encouraged.</P>
<PB N="296" REF="185"/>
<P>Now seeing neither the Prince nor any of his Sub∣jects upon any account whatsoever, have moved and begun this War, but only defended themselves, their Properties, Laws, and Liberties, from the Encroach∣ments of other Persons; and since the <HI>English,</HI> for either Malice or Covetousness to obtain our Estates, have unjustly occasioned all these Troubles and Broils in the Kingdom, we are assured that our Defence is just and lawful, and therein depend upon the Aid and Assistance of Heaven; which will be most cruel∣ly revenged upon our sacrilegious and inhumane Ene∣mies, who have left no manner of Enormities, in relation to God and Man, uncommitted. Therefore your Grace would more justly threaten your Eccle∣siastical Censures, against the Authors and Abettors of such unparallell'd Villanies, than the innocent Suf∣ferers. And besides, we much admire, that you should advise us to part with our own Estates, and to live among our Enemies; as if, when we cannot peaceably enjoy what is our own unquestionable Right, we might expect to have quiet possession of another Mans: And though, as you say, it be hard to live in War and perpetual Danger; yet much harder it is, to be utterly destroyed and reduced to nothing; especially, when we seek but the Defence of our own Liberties from the insatiable Ambition of our Enemies. And seeing your Grace has pro∣mised to fulminate Sentence against all them that ei∣ther for Malice or Profit would hinder and obstruct the Peace; it is evident who in this respect are Trans∣gressors and Delinquents; the fear and apprehension of Imprisonment and Ejection out of our Estates, the sense of Oppression and tyrannical Government, have∣ing compell'd us to take up Arms for the security of our Lives and Fortunes. Therefore as the <HI>English</HI> are not disposessed of their Estates, for their Offences against the King, so we are willing to be punished, or make other Satisfaction for our Crimes, without being disinherited; and as to the breach of the Peace, 'tis notorious that they were the Authors, who ne∣ver regarded either Promise or Covenant, never
<PB N="297" REF="185"/> made Amends for Trespasses, nor Remedy for our Complaints.</P>
<P>When the Archbishop saw there was no likelihood of a Mediation, and that a Peace was impossible to be concluded as long as the <HI>Welch</HI> stuck upon Con∣ditions; he presently relinquished his pretended Af∣fection towards them, and denounced a Sentence of Excommunication against the Prince and all his Ad∣herents. It was a subject of no little wonder, that a Person of so reputed a Sanctity, who esteemed the several Grievances done to the <HI>Welch</HI> to be intoler∣able, should now condemn them for refusal of unli∣mited Submission to the King of <HI>England;</HI> whereas he had already owned it to be unreasonable. But this ecclesiastical Censure was only a Prologue to a more melancholy Scene; King <HI>Edward</HI> immediately upon it, sending an Army by Sea to <HI>Anglesey,</HI> with∣out any great Opposition, conquered the Island, and without any Mercy, put all that withstood him to the Sword. From thence designing to pass over to the Continent, he caused a Bridg of Boats covered with Planks to be built over the <HI>Menay</HI> (being an Arm of the Sea which parteth the Isle from the main Land) at a place called <HI>Moel y don,</HI> not far from <HI>Bangor,</HI> where the Water is narrowest. The Bridg being fi∣nished, which was so broad as that Threescore Men might pass in a breast, <HI>William Latimer,</HI> with a strong Party of the best experienced Soldiers, and Sir <HI>Lucas Thany,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Gascoigns</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whereof a great number served the King, passed o∣ver, but could discover no sign, or any the least inti∣mation of an Enemy. But as soon as the Tide be∣gan to appear, and the Sea had overflown beside the Bridg, down come the <HI>Welch</HI> fiercely out of the Mountains, and setting upon the disheartned <HI>English,</HI> killed or drowned their whole number, excepting <HI>La∣timer,</HI> who by the swimming of his Horse got safe to the Bridg In this Action, several worthy Soldiers of the <HI>English</HI> side were lost; among whom were Sir <HI>Lu∣cas Thany, Robert Clifford,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Lyndsey,</HI> two Brothers of <HI>Robert Burnel</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bath,</HI> with many
<PB N="298" REF="186"/> others; in all to the number of Thirteen Knights, Se∣venteen young Gentlemen, and Two Hundred com∣mon Soldiers. A little after, or as some say afore, an∣other Engagement passed between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Welch,</HI> wherein the former lost Fourteen Colours, the Lords <HI>Audley</HI> and <HI>Clifford</HI> the younger being slain, and the King himself forced to retreat for safety to the Ca∣stle of <HI>Hope.</HI></P>
<P>And while these things passed in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> and Sir <HI>Edmund Mortimer</HI> acted vi∣gorously with their Forces in <HI>South-Wales;</HI> and fight∣ing the <HI>Welch</HI> at <HI>Lhandeilo Fawr,</HI> overthrew them, with the loss of no considerable Person, saving <HI>Wil∣liam de Valence</HI> the King's Cosin-German, and Four Knights besides. Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> was all this while in <HI>Cardigan,</HI> a wasting and destroying all the Coun∣try, and principally the Lands of <HI>Rhys ap Meredith,</HI> who very unnaturally held with the King of <HI>England</HI> in all these Wars. But being at length tired with Action, with a few Men privately separated himself from his Army, and came to <HI>Buelht,</HI> thinking to ease and respit himself there undiscovered. But coming to the River <HI>Wye,</HI> he met with <HI>Edmund Mortimer</HI> and <HI>John Gifford,</HI> with a considerable Party of the People of that Country, which <HI>Mortimer</HI> was Lord of. But neither Party venturing to assail the other, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> with one only Servant retired to a private Grove in a neighbouring Valley, there to consult with certain Lords of the Country, who had appointed to meet him. In the mean time <HI>Mortimer</HI> descends from the Hill, with intention to fall upon <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>'s Men; which they perceiving, betook themselves to the Bridg called <HI>Pont Orewyn,</HI> and manfully defended the Pas∣sage he was to cross. <HI>Mortimer</HI> could effect nothing against them, till he had gained the Bridg, the River being unpassable; and to force them to quit it, seem∣ed altogether impracticable. But at last, the River was discovered to be fordable a little below, and so <HI>Helias Walwyn</HI> was detached with a Party through the River, who unexpectedly falling upon the backs of the Defendants, easily forced them to leave the
<PB N="299" REF="186"/> Bridg, and save themselves by flight. Prince <HI>Lhe∣welyn</HI> all this while in vain expected the Lords of <HI>Buelht,</HI> and in fine continued to wait so long, till <HI>Mortimer</HI> having passed over the Bridg, surrounded the Wood he was in with armed Men. The Prince perceiving himself to be betrayed, thought to make his escape to his Men; but the <HI>English</HI> so closely pur∣sued him, that before he could come in, one <HI>Adam Francton,</HI> not knowing who he was, run him through with his Sword, being unarmed. The <HI>Welch</HI> still ex∣pected the arrival of their Prince, and though but a few in number, so gallantly maintained their ground, that in spight of the far greater number of the <HI>English,</HI> they were at length with much ado put to flight. The Battel being over, <HI>Francton</HI> returned to plunder his dead; but perceiving him to be the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> he thought himself to have obtained a suffi∣cient Prize, and thereupon presently chopt off his Head, and sent it to King <HI>Edward</HI> at <HI>Conwey,</HI> who very joyfully caused it to be placed upon the highest Pinacle of the Tower of <HI>London.</HI> And thus fell this worthy Prince, the greatest, though the last of the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Blood, betrayed most basely by the Lords of <HI>Buelht,</HI> and being dead, most unworthily dealt with by the King of <HI>England;</HI> who contrary to all Presi∣dents, treated a lawful Prince like a Traytor, and ex∣posed his crowned Head to the Derision of the Mul∣titude.</P>
<P>Not long after, <HI>David</HI> the Prince's Brother was delivered up by the <HI>Welch</HI> themselves, and in a Par∣liament for that purpose assembled at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> was condemned to dye; his Head to be sent to accompa∣ny his Brothers upon the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and his four Quarters to the four Cities of <HI>Bristol, North∣hampton, York,</HI> and <HI>Winchester.</HI> Then the King for the easier keeping the <HI>Welch</HI> in due subjection, built Two strong Castles in <HI>North Wales;</HI> the one at <HI>Con∣wey</HI> and the other at <HI>Caernarvon▪</HI> There was none that now stood out besides <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> of <HI>Ystratywy;</HI> and he, finding <HI>David</HI> was gone, and himself like to do nothing to purpose, fairly yielded himself up to
<PB N="300" REF="187"/> the Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> who by the King's Orders committed him Prisoner to the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> and so all the Country of <HI>Wales</HI> became ever since subject to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>PRince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> and his Brother <HI>David</HI> being so basely taken off, and leaving no body to lay any specious Claim to the Principality of <HI>Wales;</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> by a Statute made at <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> incorporated and annexed it to the Crown of <HI>England;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno</HI> 12. <HI>Edw.</HI> I.</NOTE> consti∣tuting several new and wholsom Laws; as concern∣ing the Division of <HI>Wales</HI> into several Counties, the Form and Manner of Writs, and Proceedings in Try∣als, with many others not very unlike the Laws and Constitutions of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. But all this could never win the Affection of the <HI>Welch</HI> toward him; who by no means would own him as their Sovereign, unless he would condescend and agree to live and reign among them. They had not forgot the cruel Oppressions and intolerable Insolencies o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>English</HI> Officers; and therefore they flatly told him, they would never yield Obedience to any other, than a Prince of their own Nation, of their own Language, and whose Life and Conversation was spotless and unblameable, King <HI>Edward</HI> perceiving the <HI>Welch</HI> to be resolute and inflexible, and absolutely bent against any other Prince, than one of their own Country, happily thought of this politick, though dangerous Expedient. Queen <HI>Eleanor</HI> was now quick with Child, and ready to be delivered; and though the Season was very severe, it being the depth of Win∣ter, the King sent for her from <HI>England,</HI> and remov'd her to <HI>Caernarvon</HI> Castle, the place design'd for her to

<P>WE Your Majesty's most Dutiful and Loyal Sub∣jects, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses in Parliament Assembled; Humbly lay before Your Majesty. That whereas there is a Grant passing to <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and his Heirs, of the Manners of <HI>Denbigh, Bromfield,</HI> and <HI>Yale,</HI> and di∣vers other Lands in the Principality of <HI>Wales;</HI> to∣gether with several Estates of Inheritance, enjoyed by many of Your Majesty's Subjects by Virtue of Antient Grants from the Crown:</P>
<P>That the said Mannors, with the large and exten∣sive Royalties, Powers, and Jurisdictions to the same belonging, are of great Concern to Your Majesty and the Crown of this Realm: And that the same have been usually Annex'd to the Principality of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Settled on the Princes of <HI>Wales</HI> for their Support: And that a great number of Your Majesty's Subjects, in those Parts, hold their Estates by Royal Tenure, under great and valuable Compositions, Rents, Royal-Pay∣ments, and Services to the Crown and Princes of <HI>Wales;</HI> and have by such Tenure great Dependance on Your Ma∣jesty and the Crown of <HI>England;</HI> and have enjoyed great Privileges and Advantages with their Estates, under such Tenure.</P>
<P>We therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty, to put a stop to the Passing this Grant to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> of the said Mannors and Lands; and that the same may not be disposed from the Crown, but by Consent of Parliament: For that such Grant, is in Diminution of the Honour and Interest of the Crown, by placing in a Subject, such large and extensive Royal∣ties, Powers, and Jurisdictions, which ought only to be in the Crown; and will Sever that Dependance, which so great a Number of Your Majesty's Subjects, in those Parts, have on Your Majesty and the Crown, by reason of their Tenure; and may be to their great Oppression in those Rights which they have purchased, and hither∣to enjoyed with their Estates: And also, on Occasion of
<PB N="304" REF="189"/> great Vexation to many of Your Majesty's Subjects, who have long had the absolute Inheritance of several Lands (comprehended in the said Grant to the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI>) by Antient Grants from the Crown.</P>

<P>The Lordship of <HI>Ruthyn</HI> continued in the posses∣sion of the <HI>Grays,</HI> till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. when <HI>George Grey</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Ruthyn,</HI> upon some Bargain, passed the same over to the King, since which it has been in the possession of some of the Earls of <HI>Warwick</HI> and afterwards came to the <HI>Mid∣dletons</HI> of <HI>Chirk</HI> Castle in the County of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> where it still continues; being now enjoyed by the Right Worshipful Sir <HI>Richard Middleton,</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P>But besides <HI>Henry Lacy</HI> and <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> several other Gentlemen of Quality, came at this time with King <HI>Edward</HI> to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> who in some time be∣came to be Men of great Possessions and Sway in the Country, whose Posterity enjoy the same to this time. But he that expected to fare best in the di∣stribution of these Lordships and Estates in <HI>Wales,</HI> was one <HI>Rhys ap Meredith,</HI> a <HI>Welch</HI> Man, and one that, contrary to the Allegiance sworn to his Prince, and his Duty to his Native Country, had served the King of <HI>England</HI> in all these Wars, and done the greatest hurt of any Man to the Interest of Prince <HI>Lhewelyn.</HI> For these great Services done to King <HI>Edward, Rhys</HI> expected no less than to be promoted
<PB N="305" REF="189"/> to the highest Preferments; whom the King after the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Overthrow, first dubbed Knight, and afterwards fed him with fair Words and great Promises.</P>
<P>But when he, and all his Neighbours and Coun∣trymen had submitted themselves to the Government of the King of <HI>England;</HI> it happened that the Lord <HI>Pain Tiptost,</HI> Warden of the King's Castles which joyned to <HI>Rhys</HI>'s Country, and the Lord <HI>Alan Pluck∣net,</HI> the King's Steward in <HI>Wales,</HI> cited Sir <HI>Rhys ap Meredith,</HI> with all the rest of the Country, to the King's Court; which he refusing to do, alledging his antient Priviledges and Liberties, together with the King's Promises to him, the foresaid Officers pro∣ceeded against him according to Law. Whereupon <MILESTONE N="1289" UNIT="A.D."/> Sir <HI>Rhys</HI> being greatly vexed to be thus served by those whole Interest he had all this while so warmly espou∣sed, thought to be revenged of <HI>Pain Tiptost,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>English.</HI> And to that end, having drawn together some of his Tenants and Countrymen, he fell upon the said <HI>Pain Tiptost;</HI> between whom se∣veral Skirmishes afterwards happened, and several Men were slain on both sides. King <HI>Edward</HI> was now at <HI>Arragon,</HI> to compose the Difference betwixt the Kings of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and <HI>Naples;</HI> but being in∣formed of the Disturbances which had happened in <HI>Wales,</HI> betwixt his Ministers there, and Sir <HI>Rhys ap Meredith;</HI> he writ to this latter, requiring him to keep the Peace, till his return; at what time he would redress all Grievances, and reduce Matters to a good and reasonable Order. But Sir <HI>Rhys</HI> have∣ing already waited sufficiently upon the King's Pro∣mises, and being now in a good condition to offend his Enemies by force of Arms, would not give over the Enterprize he saw so promising, but marching with his Forces to his Enemies Lands, burnt and spoiled several Towns belonging to the <HI>English.</HI> Up∣on this, the King sent to the Earl of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> whom he had appointed his Deputy during his absence, to march with an Army into <HI>Wales,</HI> to repress the In∣solencies, and to prevent any farther disorderly At∣tempts
<PB N="306" REF="190"/> of the <HI>Welch.</HI> The Earl accordingly prepared an Army and went against Sir <HI>Rhys</HI>'s, whose Army he quickly dispersed, and overthrew his Castle of <HI>Dre∣folan,</HI> but not without the loss of some of his Chief Men. For as they besieged and undermined the said Castle, the <HI>Walls</HI> unexpectedly fell down, by which unlucky Accident, several of the <HI>English</HI> were oppres∣sed and bruised to Death, among whom were the Lord <HI>Strafford,</HI> and the Lord <HI>William de Monchency.</HI> But within a while after, <HI>Robert Tiptost</HI> Lord Deputy of <HI>Wales,</HI> raised a very powerful Army against Sir <HI>Rhys,</HI> and after a slaughter of 4000 of the <HI>Welch,</HI> took him Prisoner, who the <HI>Michaelmas</HI> following, at the King's going to <HI>Scotland,</HI> was condemned and executed at <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1293" UNIT="A.D."/> But the Death of Sir <HI>Rhys</HI> did not put a final pe∣riod to all the Quarrels betwixt the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welch,</HI> for in a short time after, there happened a new occasion for the <HI>Welch</HI> to murmur against, and upbraid the Government of the <HI>English</HI> over them. King <HI>Edward</HI> was now in actual Enmity and War with the King of <HI>France,</HI> for the carrying on of which, he wanted a liberal Subsidy and Supply from his Sub∣jects. This Tax was with a great deal of passion and reluctancy levied in divers places of the King∣dom, but more especially in <HI>Wales,</HI> the <HI>Welch</HI> being never acquainted with such large Contributions be∣fore, <MILESTONE N="1294" UNIT="A.D."/> violently stormed and exclaimed against it. But not being satisfied with villifying the King's Com∣mand, they took their own Captain <HI>Roger de Puelesdon,</HI> who was appointed Collector of the said Subsidy, and hanged him up, together with divers others who a∣betted the collecting of the Tax. Then <HI>West-Wales</HI> Men chose <HI>Maelgon Fychan</HI> for their Captain, and so entring into <HI>Caermardhyn</HI> and <HI>Pembroke-shires,</HI> they cruelly harassed all the Lands that belonged to the <HI>English,</HI> and then returned laden with considerable Booty. The <HI>Glamorgan-shire</HI> Men, and they towards the <HI>South</HI> Parts, chose one <HI>Morgan</HI> for their Leader, and set upon the Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> whom they forced to make his escape out of the Country; and so <HI>Mor∣gan</HI>
<PB N="307" REF="190"/> was put in possession of those Lands which the Ancestors of the Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> had forcibly taken away from <HI>Morgan</HI>'s fore-Fathers. On the other side, the <HI>North-Wales</HI> Men set up one <HI>Madoc,</HI> related to the last <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> slain at <HI>Buelht,</HI> who having drawn to∣gether a great Number of Men, came to <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> and setting upon the <HI>English,</HI> who in great multitudes had then resorted thither to a Fair, slew a great many, and afterwards spoiled and ransacked the whole Town. King <HI>Edward</HI> being acquainted with these different Insurrections and Rebellions in <HI>Wales,</HI> and desirous to quell the Pride and Stubborness of the <HI>Welch,</HI> but most of all to revenge the Death of his great favourite <HI>Roger de Pulesdon,</HI> recalled his Brother <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and <HI>Henry Lacy</HI> Earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> who with a consider∣able Army were ready to embark for <HI>Gascoign,</HI> and countermanded them into <HI>Wales.</HI> Being arrived there, they passed quietly forward, till they came to <HI>Den∣bigh,</HI> and as soon as they drew near unto the Castle, upon St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s day the <HI>Welch</HI> with great Fury and Courage faced them, and joyning Battels, forced them back with a very considerable loss. <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> says, (but upon what Authority is not known) that the <HI>Welch</HI> obtained this Victory rather upon the account that the <HI>English</HI> Army was hired with such Money as had been wrongfully taken out of the Ab∣bies and other Religious places, so that it was a Judg∣ment from above, more than the Force of the <HI>Welch,</HI> that overcame the <HI>English</HI> Army. But be the cause of it what it will, 'tis certain the <HI>English</HI> were van∣quished, upon which account King <HI>Edward</HI> came in Person to <HI>Wales,</HI> and kept his <HI>Christmas</HI> at <HI>Aberconwey,</HI> where <HI>Robert Winchelsey</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> be∣ing returned from <HI>Rome,</HI> came to him, and having done Homage, returned honourably again to <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> But as the King advanced farther into the Country, having but one part of his Army with him, the <HI>Welch</HI> set upon and took most of his Carriages, which contained a great quantity of Victuals and Provision, so that the King with all his followers were
<PB N="308" REF="191"/> constrained to endure a great deal of hardships, in so much that at last Water mixed with Honey, and very course and ordinary Bread with the saltest Meat, were accounted the greatest Delicacies for his Maje∣sty's own Table. But their misery was like to be greater, had not the other part of the Army come in time because the <HI>Welch</HI> had encompassed the King round, in hopes to reduce him to the utmost distress, by reason that the Water was so risen, that the rest of the Army could not get to him. But the Water within some time after abating, the remainder of the Army came in, whereupon the <HI>Welch</HI> presently retired, and made their escape. One thing is very remark∣able of King <HI>Edward</HI> during his distress at <HI>Snowden,</HI> that when the Army was reduced to very great extre∣mity, a small quantity of Wine was found, which they thought to reserve for the King's own use. But he to prevent any discontent, which might thereupon be raised in his Souldiers, absolutely refused to taste thereof, telling them. <HI>That in time of Necessity all things should be common, and as he was the Cause and Author of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Distress, he would not be preferred be∣fore them in his Diet.</HI></P>
<P>But whilst the King remained in <HI>Snowden,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> being informed that a great Number of <HI>Welch</HI> were assembled, and had lodged themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a certain Valley betwixt two Woods, chose out a Troop of Horse, together with some Cross-Bows and Archers, and set upon them in the Night time. The <HI>Welch</HI> being thus surprised, and unexpectedly en∣compassed about by their Enemies, made the best they could to oppose them, and so pitching their Spears in the ground, and directing the points towards their Enemies, endeavoured by such means to keep off the Horse. But the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> having or∣dered his Battel so, as that between every two Horse there stood a Cross-Bow, so gauled the <HI>Welch</HI> with the shot of the quarrels, that the Spear-men fell apace, and then the Horse breaking easily in upon the rest, bare them down with so great a slaughter, as the <HI>Welch</HI> had never received before. After this, King
<PB N="309" REF="191"/> <HI>Edward</HI> to prevent any more rebellious attempts of the <HI>Welch,</HI> cut down all the Woods in <HI>Wales,</HI> where∣in, in any time of Danger, they were wont to hide and save themselves. And for a farther security, he repaired and fortified all the Castles and places of Strength in <HI>Wales,</HI> and built the Castle of <HI>Bewmoris</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> and so having put all things in a settled posture, and punished those that had been the occasion of the Death of <HI>Roger de Pulesdon,</HI> he re∣turned with his Army into <HI>England.</HI> But as soon as the King had left the <HI>Welch, Madoc,</HI> who, as it is said before, was chosen Captain by the <HI>North-Wales</HI> Men, gathered some Forces together, and came to <HI>Oswestry,</HI> which presently yielded to him. And then meeting with the Lord <HI>Strange</HI> near <HI>Knookine,</HI> who with a Detachment of the <HI>Marchers</HI> came to oppose him, gave him Battel, vanquished his Forces, and miserably ra∣vaged his Country. The like Success he obtained a second time against the <HI>Marchers,</HI> but at last they brought together a very great Number of Men, and met <HI>Madoc</HI> marching towards <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewsbury,</HI> upon the Hills of <HI>Cefn Digolh,</HI> not far from <HI>Camrs</HI> Castle, where after a bloody Fight on both sides, <HI>Madoc</HI> was taken Prisoner, and his Army vanquished and put to flight. Then he was sent to <HI>London,</HI> and there sen∣tenced to remain in perpetual Imprisonment in the <HI>Tower,</HI> tho' others affirm, that <HI>Madoc</HI> was never taken, but that after several Adventures and severe Conflicts, whereby the <HI>Welch</HI> were reduced to great extremi∣ties, he came in, and submitted himself to the King, who received him upon Condition he would not de∣sist to pursue <HI>Morgan</HI> Captain of the <HI>Glamorgan-shire</HI> Men, till he brought him Prisoner before him. <HI>Ma∣doc</HI> having performed this, and the whole Country being peaceable and undisturbed, several Hostages from the Chiefest Nobility of <HI>Wales</HI> for their order∣ly and quiet behaviour were delivered to the King, who disposed of them into divers Castles in <HI>England,</HI> where they continued in safe Custody till the end of the War, which was presently-commenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

<P>But for all that these Letters passed betwixt them, whether by reason that <HI>Bruce</HI>'s Terms were conceived unreasonable, nothing however was concluded upon, and the whole Treaty came to nothing. But Sir <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> tho' without any hopes of assistance from the <HI>Scots,</HI> would not lay aside what he had once un∣dertaken, and therefore having gathered all the For∣ces he could, desperately set upon, and almost in an instant over-ran all <HI>North-Wales</HI> and the <HI>Marches,</HI> sei∣sing upon all the Castles and Strong-holds thro' the Country. But all to no purpose, for as the most violent stream is quickly over, so Sir <HI>Gruffydh</HI>'s Army was presently spent, and then being met with by a strong Detachment of <HI>English,</HI> his Party was easily discomfited, and himself taken Prisoner.</P>
<P>The same Year being the 15th. of the reign of King <MILESTONE N="1322" UNIT="A.D."/> <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, his eldest Son <HI>Edward</HI> born at <HI>Windsor,</HI> in a Parliament holden at <HI>York,</HI> was created Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Duke of <HI>Aquitaine,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Chester.</HI> This Prince succeeded his Father in the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, one of the greatest and most powerful Mo∣narchs that ever sat upon the <HI>English</HI> Throne.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> born at <HI>Woodstock,</HI> eldest Son and Heir to <MILESTONE N="1343" UNIT="A.D."/> King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, was created Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> upon the 12th. day of <HI>May</HI> in the 17th. year of his Father's reign, being then about fourteen years of
<PB N="314" REF="194"/> age. He was a Prince of incomparable Qualifica∣tions, but so signally Famous in Martial Affairs, that upon the account of the several Actions he was en∣gaged in, he received the Name of <HI>Black-Prince.</HI> He took <HI>John</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King Prisoner at the Battel of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> and shamefully vanquished the <HI>French</HI> Army in the Battel of <HI>Cressy.</HI> He did not live to en∣joy the Crown, but died one year before his Father, in the Forty Sixth Year of his Age; no Prince was in his life-time better beloved, and after his Death more lamented by the <HI>English</HI> Nation, who had he lived to sit upon the Helm, no one doubted but that he would have exceeded as to all Qualifications, the most glorious Renown of the greatest of his Ance∣stors.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, lived Sir <HI>Tudor Vaughan ap Grono,</HI> descended lineally from <HI>Ednyfed Vaughan,</HI> a Person as to Estate, Power and Interest, one of the Chiefest in <HI>North Wales.</HI> Upon some motive, either of Ambition or Fancy, he assumed to himself the Honor of Knighthood, requiring all People to call and stile him Sir <HI>Tudor ap Grono,</HI> as if he did prognosticate and fore-see, that out of his Loyns should arise those that should have Power to confer that Honor. King <HI>Edward</HI> being informed of such unparallell'd Presumption, sent for Sir <HI>Tudor,</HI> and asked him, <HI>With what Confidence he durst invade his Prerogative, by assuming the degree of Knighthood, without his Authority.</HI> Sir <HI>Tudor</HI> replied, <HI>That by the Laws and Constitution of King</HI> Arthur, <HI>he had the Li∣berty of taking upon himself that Title, in regard he had those three Qualifications, which whosoever was endued with, could by those Laws claim the Honor of a Knight.</HI> 1. <HI>He was a Gentleman.</HI> 2. <HI>He had a sufficient Estate.</HI> And 3. <HI>He was Valiant and Ad∣venturous;</HI> adding this withal, <HI>If my Valour and Har∣diness be doubted of, loe here I throw down my Glove, and for due proof of my Courage, I am ready to Fight with any Man, whatever he be.</HI> The King apppro∣ving and liking well the Man's forwardness and reso∣lution, was easily persuaded to confirm the Honor of
<PB N="315" REF="194"/> Knighthood upon him. From this Sir <HI>Tudor</HI> lineally descended <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh King of <HI>England,</HI> who was the Son of <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Son of Sir <HI>Owen Tudor,</HI> Son to <HI>Meredith,</HI> the Son of this Sir <HI>Tudor ap Gono.</HI></P>
<P>After the Death of the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> his Son <HI>Richard</HI> born at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> being but Ten Years of age, was created Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> at <HI>Havering</HI> at <HI>Bowre,</HI> on the 20th. day of <HI>November,</HI> and in the <MILESTONE N="1377" UNIT="A.D."/> 50th. Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, his Grandfather's reign, whom he succeeded in the Crown of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> born at <HI>Monmouth,</HI> Son and Heir to <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth King of <HI>England,</HI> upon the 15th. of <HI>October,</HI> in the 1st. Year of his Father's reign, was created Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> who succeeded his Father in the <HI>English</HI> Crown by the Name of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>Richard</HI> the Second reigned, one <HI>Owen ap Gruffydh Fychan,</HI> descended of a younger Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Madoc</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield,</HI> was not a lit∣tle Famous. This <HI>Owen</HI> had his Education in one of the <HI>Inns-of-Court,</HI> where he became <HI>Barister</HI> at Law, and afterwards in very great Favour and Credit served King <HI>Richard,</HI> and continued with him at <HI>Flint</HI> Castle, till at length the King was taken by <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster.</HI> Betwixt this <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Reginald</HI> Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Rhuthyn,</HI> there happened no small Dif∣ference touching a Common lying between the Lord∣ship of <HI>Rhuthyn,</HI> whereof <HI>Reginald</HI> was Owner, and the Lordship of <HI>Glyndowrdwy</HI> in the possession of <HI>Owen,</HI> whence he borrowed the Name of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> Du∣ring the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, <HI>Owen</HI> as being a Courtier, and in no mean esteem with the King, did over-power <HI>Reginald,</HI> who was neither so well be∣friended at Court, nor beloved in the Country as <HI>Owen</HI> was. But after King <HI>Richard</HI>'s deposal, the Scene was altered, and <HI>Reginald</HI> as then better be∣friended than <HI>Owen,</HI> entred upon the Common▪ which occasioned <HI>Owen</HI> in the first Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth to make his Complaint in Parliament against him,
<PB N="316" REF="195"/> for thus divesting him of his Right. No redress be∣ing found, the Bishop of St. <HI>Asaph</HI> wished the Lords to take care, that by thus slighting his Complaint, they did not irritate and provoke the <HI>Welch</HI> to an Insurre∣ction, to which some of the Lords replied, <HI>That they did not fear those rascally bare-fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted People. Glyndwr</HI> therefore perceiving how his Petition was slighted in Parliament, and finding no other method to redress himself, having several Friends and Fol∣lowers, put himself in Arms against <HI>Reginald,</HI> and meeting him in the Field, overcame and took him pri∣soner, and spoiled his Lordship of <HI>Rhuthyn.</HI> Upon this many resorted to him from all parts of <HI>Wales,</HI> some thinking him to be in as great Favour now, as in King <HI>Richard</HI>'s days, others putting in his head, that now the time was come when the <HI>Britains</HI> by his means might again recover the Honor and Liber∣ties of their Ancestors. But <HI>Reginald</HI> being thus kept prisoner, and very severely handled by <HI>Owen,</HI> to ter∣rify him into compliance with him in his rebellious Actings, and not permitted to have his Liberty, un∣der Ten Thousand Marks for his Ransom, whereof Six Thousand to be paid upon the Feast of St. <HI>Martyn,</HI> in the 4th. Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and to deliver up his eldest Son with some other Persons of Qua∣lity as Hostages for the remainder; the King at the humble sute of <HI>Reginald,</HI> seeing no other way for his enlargement, gave way thereto, authorizing Sir <HI>Wil∣liam de Roos,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard de Grey,</HI> Sir <HI>William de Wil∣lughby,</HI> Sir <HI>William le Zouche,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh Huls,</HI> as also, <HI>John Harvey, William Vaus, John Lee, John Langford, Thomas Payne,</HI> and <HI>John Elnestow,</HI> to treat with <HI>Owen</HI> and his Council, and to conclude in what they should conceive most expedient and necessary to be done for his redemption. Whereupon they consenting to give the sum demanded by <HI>Glyndwr</HI> for his deliverance, the King gave License to <HI>Robert Braybroke</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> as also to Sir <HI>Gerard Braybroke</HI> the Father, and Sir <HI>Gerard</HI> the Son, then Feoffees of divers Lordships for this <HI>Reginald,</HI> to sell the Mannor of <HI>Hertelegh</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> towards the raising of that
<PB N="317" REF="195"/> Money. And for the better enabling him to pay so great a Fine, the King was pleased to grant, that whereas it was enacted, that such Persons who were owners of Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and did not there reside, should for such their neglect, forfeit two parts of the Profits of them to the King; that notwithstanding this Act, he should forfeit nothing for non-residence there, during the term of six years next ensuing.</P>
<P>This good Success over the Lord <HI>Gray,</HI> together with the numerous resort of the <HI>Welch</HI> to him, and the favourable interpretations of the Prophecies of <HI>Merdhyn,</HI> which some construed very advantagi∣oussy, made the swelling mind of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> over∣flow its Banks, and gave him some hopes of restoring this Island back to the <HI>Britains.</HI> Wherefore he set upon the Earl of <HI>March,</HI> who met him with a nu∣merous party of <HI>Hereford-shire</HI> Men, but when they came to close, the <HI>Welch</HI>-men proved too powerful, and having killed above a Thousand Men of the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> they took the Earl of <HI>March</HI> Prisoner. King <HI>Henry</HI> upon this was frequently requested to Ransom the Earl, but to no purpose; for whether by reason that <HI>Mortimer</HI> had a juster Title to the Crown than himself, he being the next Heir in Blood after King <HI>Richard,</HI> who was as yet living, or because of some other private <HI>odium,</HI> the King would never hearken to his Redemp∣tion, alledging that he wilfully threw himself into the hands of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> But about the midst of <HI>August,</HI> to correct the presumptuous Attempts of the <HI>Welch,</HI> the King went in Person with a great Army into <HI>Wales;</HI> but by reason of extraordinary excess of wea∣ther, which some attributed to the Magic of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> he was glad to return safe.</P>
<P>But the Earl of <HI>March</HI> perceiving that he was not like to obtain his Liberty by King <HI>Henry</HI>'s means, whether out of compliance, by reason of his tedious Captivity, or Affection to the young Lady, he agreed to take part with <HI>Owen</HI> against the King of <HI>England,</HI> and to marry his Daughter; with them joyned the Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and his Brother the Earl of <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI> with his Son the valiant Lord <HI>Percy,</HI> who
<PB N="318" REF="196"/> conspiring to depose the King of <HI>England,</HI> in the House of the Archdeacon of <HI>Bangor,</HI> by their Deputies di∣vided the Realm amongst them, causing a tripartite Indenture to be made, and to be sealed with every one's Seal; by which Covenant all that Country ly∣ing betwixt the <HI>Severn</HI> and the <HI>Trent, Southward,</HI> was assigned to the Earl of <HI>March;</HI> all <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Lands beyond the <HI>Severn, Westward,</HI> were appointed <HI>Glyndwr;</HI> and all from the <HI>Trent, Northward,</HI> to the Lord <HI>Percy.</HI> This was done (as some said) thro' a foolish Credit they gave to a vain Prophecy, as tho' King <HI>Henry</HI> was the execrable Moldwarp, and they three the Dragon, the Lion, and the Wolf which should pull him down, and distribute his Kingdom among themselves. After that they exhibited Articles of their Grievances to King <HI>Henry,</HI> and divulged their Rea∣sons for taking up Arms; at length they marched with all their Power towards <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> to fight the King, depending mainly upon the arrival of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> and his <HI>Welch-men.</HI> But the matter was gone so far, that whether he came in or no, they must fight, and so both Armies being joyned, the King's Party prevailed, young <HI>Percy</HI> being slain upon the spot, and <HI>Douglas,</HI> besides most of the <HI>English</HI> of Quality, who with a Party of <HI>Scotch</HI> had come to the Aid of the Confederates, was taken Prisoner, but afterwards honourably set at Liberty by the Intercession of the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> In the mean time the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was a marching forward with a great Party from the <HI>North,</HI> but the King having settled Matters about <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> coming to <HI>York,</HI> and sending to him to lay down his Arms, he vo∣luntarily submitted and dismissed his Forces. Then the King returning from <HI>York-shire,</HI> determined to pass over to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> to chastise the presump∣tuous Practices of the immorigerous <HI>Welch,</HI> who after his departure from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> had made in-Roads into the Marches, and done much hurt to his <HI>English</HI> Subjects. But other Business of greater Consequence intervening, he detached his Son the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who took the Castle of <HI>Aberystwyth,</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="196"/> which was quickly again retaken by <HI>Owen Glyndwr,</HI> who thrust into it a strong Garrison of <HI>Welch.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Battel of <HI>Huske</HI> sought upon the fifteenth of <HI>March,</HI> the <HI>Welch</HI> received a very considerable Blow from the Prince's Men, <HI>Glyndwr</HI>'s Son being taken Prisoner, besides Fifteen Hundred more taken and slain. After this, we hear little of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> ex∣cepting that he continued and persisted to vex and plague the <HI>English</HI> upon the Marches, to the tenth year of King <HI>Henry</HI>'s reign, when he miserably ended his life; being as <HI>Holingshed</HI> reporteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holins.</NOTE> towards his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter days driven to that extremity, that despairing of all comfort, he fled and lurked in Caves and other the most solitary places, fearing to shew his face to any Creature, till at length being starved for hun∣ger and lack of sustenance, he miserably ended his life.</P>
<P>But these rebellious Practices of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> highly exasperated King <HI>Henry</HI> against the <HI>Welch,</HI> insomuch that several rigorous and unmerciful Laws were enacted, relating to <HI>Wales,</HI> which in effect destroyed all the Liberties of the <HI>Welch</HI> Subject. They were made incapable of purchasing any Lands, or to be elected Members of any County or Burrough, and to undertake any Office, whether Civil or Military in any Town incorporated. If any Suit at Law happened betwixt an <HI>English</HI> Man and a <HI>Welch</HI> Man, the former could not be convicted, but by the Sentence of an <HI>English</HI> Judge, and the Ver∣dict of an <HI>English</HI> Jury; besides, that any <HI>En∣glish</HI> Man who married a <HI>Welch</HI> Woman, was thereby forthwith disfranchised from all the Liber∣ties of an <HI>English</HI> Subject. It was farther enact∣ed, that no <HI>Welch</HI> Man should be in possession of any Castle, or other place of Strength, and that no Victuals or Armour should be brought into <HI>Wales,</HI> without a special Warrant from the King or his Council; and farther, that no <HI>Welch</HI> Man was capable of undertaking the Office of Justice, Chamberlain, Sheriff or any other place of Trust in any part of <HI>Wales,</HI> notwithstanding any Patent
<PB N="320" REF="197"/> or License heretofore given to the contrary. These, with many others most rigorous and unjust Laws, particularly that forbidding any <HI>Welch</HI> Man to bring up his Children to Learning, or to bind them Ap∣prentices to any Trade or Occupation, were enacted by the King against the <HI>Welch;</HI> so that nothing could cool his displeasure, but that a whole Nation should be wrongfully oppressed, for the fault and miscarriage of one Person. But one might think, that this was no politick method to secure a Nation in its Allegiance, which upon lighter Affronts was used to defend its Priviledges; and therefore we may well attribute the quiet disposition of the <HI>Welch</HI> towards this time, to the moderation of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, who within a little time succeeded his Father in the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Co-temporary with <HI>Glyndwr</HI> was Sir <HI>David Gam,</HI> so called by reason he had but one Eye▪ the Son of <HI>Lhewelyn ap Howel Vaughan</HI> of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> by <HI>Mawd</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Iefan ap Rhys ap Ifor</HI> of <HI>Eluel.</HI> He was a great stickler for the Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and for that reason became mortal Enemy to <HI>Glyn∣dwr,</HI> who having his Education, as is said before, at one of the Inns of Court, got to be preferred to the service of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, who, as <HI>Walsingham</HI> says, made him his <HI>Scutifer,</HI> or Shield-bearer. But being informed that his Master <HI>Richard</HI> was deposed and murdered, and withal being pro∣voked by several Wrongs and Affronts done him by his Neighbour the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Rhuthyn,</HI> whom King <HI>Henry</HI> greatly countenanced, and look∣ing upon <HI>Henry</HI> as an Usurper, he caused himself to be proclaimed Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> And for a better grace of the matter, he feigned himself to be descended by a Daughter from <HI>Lhewelyn ap Gruffydh</HI> the last Prince; whereas in truth, he came Pater∣nally but from a younger Brother of the House of <HI>Powys.</HI> But as Ambition has no moderation, so <HI>Glyndwr</HI> for a time acted the part of a Prince, and summoned a Parliament to meet at <HI>Machynlleth,</HI> whither the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Wales</HI> ap∣peared,
<PB N="321" REF="197"/> and among the rest Sir <HI>David Gam,</HI> but not upon the same design with the rest, having an intention in this meeting to murder <HI>Glyndyfwr.</HI> But the Plot being discovered, and Sir <HI>David</HI> secured, he had liked to undergo present Execution, had not <HI>Glyndyfwr</HI>'s best Friends, and the greatest Upholders of his Cause, pleaded in his behalf, by whose in∣tercession he was prevailed with to grant Sir <HI>David</HI> both his Life and Liberty, upon condition he would ever after continue True and Loyal to him. Sir <HI>David</HI> promised very loudly, but with the reserva∣tion never to perform; for as soon as he came to his own Country, where he was a Person of very considerable Sway and Interest, he did exceedingly annoy and molest those that any way favoured or adhered to <HI>Glyndyfwr.</HI> While Sir <HI>David</HI> lay in Pri∣son at <HI>Machynlleth,</HI> for his attempt against <HI>Owen</HI>'s Life, this <HI>Englyn</HI> was made upon him.</P>

<P>But <HI>Glyndyfwr</HI> receiving information, how that Sir <HI>David Gam,</HI> contrary to the Promise he had made at his releasement, endeavoured all he could to de∣stroy his Interest among the <HI>Welch,</HI> entred the Marches, and among other tokens of his Indigna∣tion, burned the House of Sir <HI>David,</HI> and as the report goes, calling to him one of Sir <HI>David</HI>'s Te∣nants, spake to him thus merrily in Verse,
<Q><L>O Gweli di wr côch Cam</L>
<L>Yn ymofyn y Girnigwen</L>
<L>Dywed ei bôd hi Tan y Lan</L>

<PB N="322" REF="198"/> he lived for the most part at Court, till the Death of <HI>Glyndyfwr.</HI></P>
<P>When King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth went with an Army to <HI>France</HI> against the <HI>French</HI> King, Sir <HI>David Gam</HI> brought into his service a numerous Party of Stout and Valorous <HI>Welch</HI>-Men, who upon all occasions expressed their Courage and Resolution. In the Battel of <HI>Agincourt,</HI> News being brought to the King that the <HI>French</HI> Army was advancing to∣wards him, and that they were exceeding nume∣rous, he detached Captain <HI>Gam</HI> to observe their motion, and review their number. The Captain having narrowly eyed the <HI>French,</HI> found them twice to exceed the <HI>English,</HI> but not being in the least d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unted at such a multitude, he returned to the King, who enquiring of him what the Number of the <HI>French</HI> might be, he made answer, <HI>An't please you my Liege, they are enough to be killed, enough to run away, and enough to be taken Prisoners.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> was well pleased, and much encouraged with this resolute and undaunted answer of Sir <HI>David</HI>'s, whose Tongue did not express more Valor than his Hinds performed. For in the heat of Battel, the King's Person being in danger, Sir <HI>David</HI> charged the Enemy with that eagerness and masculine Bra∣very, that they were glad to give ground, and so secured the King, tho' with the loss of much Blood, and also his Life, himself and his Son-in-Law <HI>Roger Vaughan,</HI> and his Kinsman <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter Llwyd</HI> of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> having received their mortal Wounds in that encounter. When the King heard of their Condition, how that they were past all hopes of recovery, he came to them, and in recompence of their good Services, Knighted them all three in the Field, where they soon after died; and so ended the Life, but not the Fame of the signally Va∣liant Sir <HI>David Gam.</HI></P>

When the Day was lost at <HI>Tewksbury,</HI> this young Prince thought to make his escape by flight, but being unfortunately taken, and brought to the presence of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, who then sat upon the Helm, made such resolute and unexpected Replies, that he put the King to such a passion, that he smote him on the Mouth with his Gauntlet; and then his Brother <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> the Crouch-back, ran him into the Heart with his Dagget.</P>
<P><HI>Edward,</HI> born in the Sanctuary at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the eldest Son of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, was, after his Fathers Expulsion out of <HI>England,</HI> in the Fourty Ninth Year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, created Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> in the Eleventh Year of his Fathers Reign. Upon the death of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, this young Prince being then at <HI>Ludlow</HI> in the <HI>Marches</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> was presently sent for to <HI>London,</HI> and proclaimed King of <HI>England,</HI> but never liv'd to be crowned; for his Uncle <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> who was appointed his Protector, most vi∣lainously made him away, together with his Brother the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> and afterwards was himself pro∣claimed and crowned King.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, in his Wars against <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, was very much assisted by the <HI>Welch;</HI> in re∣compence of which Service, he design'd to reform Matters so in <HI>Wales,</HI> as that intolerable Oppression which they had hitherto endured, should be regulat∣ed and taken off. And to that end, he meant to establish a Court within the said Principality, and constituted <HI>John</HI> Bishop of <HI>Worcester</HI> President of the Prince's Council in the <HI>Marches;</HI> who, together with <HI>Anthony</HI> Earl of <HI>Rivers,</HI> sat in the Town-Hall of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and constituted certain Ordinances for
<PB N="324" REF="199"/> the publick Good and Tranquility of that place. But the matter proceeded no farther; for the Trou∣bles and Disquietness of his Kingdom, coming heavy upon him, and the shortness of his Reign after his Establishment not permitting, he was forced to leave that to others, which himself thought once to bring about.</P>
<P><HI>Edward,</HI> born at <HI>Middleham</HI> near <HI>Richmond</HI> in the County of <HI>York</HI> the only Son of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, was at Ten Years of Age created by his Fa∣ther Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and dyed soon after.</P>
<P><HI>Arthur,</HI> the eldest Son of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, born at <HI>Winchester,</HI> was in the Seventh Year of his Fathers Reign created Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> About the Fifteenth Year of his Age, being then newly married to <HI>Katherine</HI> the Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> he was sent by his Father into <HI>Wales,</HI> that by his presence he might keep that Country in better awe. With him King <HI>Henry</HI> sent Dr. <HI>William Smith,</HI> afterwards made Bi∣shop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wokins</HI> p. 789.</NOTE> as President of his Council; toge∣ther with Sir <HI>Richard Pool,</HI> his Chamberlain, Sir <HI>Hen∣ry Vernon,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Crofts,</HI> Sir <HI>David Philip,</HI> Sir <HI>William Ʋdal,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Englefield,</HI> Sir <HI>Peter New∣ton,</HI> and others, to be his Counsellors and Directors in his management of Affairs. But the Prince had not continu'd long there, but he fell sick at his Ca∣stle at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> of which Indisposition he shortly af∣ter dyed, and was buried with great Solemnity in the Cathedral Church of <HI>Worcester.</HI> But the creating of his Brother <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in his stead, was deferred for about the space of a Month, to discover whether the Lady <HI>Katherine</HI> was got with Child by Prince <HI>Arthur.</HI> But when it appeared for certain, she had not conceived; on the 18th day of <HI>February,</HI> in the Nineteenth Year of his Father, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Reign, <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> was created Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, being by his Grandfather <HI>Owen Tudor</HI> descended out of <HI>Wales,</HI> and having suf∣ficiently experienced the Affection of the <HI>Welch</HI> to∣wards him; first, of those, who upon his first land∣ing,
<PB N="325" REF="199"/> opportunely joyned him under Sir <HI>Rhys ap Thomas;</HI> and then of those, who under the command of Sir <HI>William Stanley,</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield, Yale,</HI> and <HI>Chirk∣land,</HI> aided him in <HI>Bosworth</HI>-Field; could not in Ho∣nour and Equity, but bear some regard to the mise∣rable state and condition of the <HI>Welch,</HI> under the <HI>English</HI> Government. And therefore this prudent Prince, finding the Calamities of the <HI>Welch</HI> to be in∣supportable, and seeing what grievous and unmerciful Laws were enacted against them by his Predecessours, he took occasion to redress and reform the same, and granted to the <HI>Welch</HI> a Charter of Liberty and Im∣munity, whereby they were released from the cruel Oppression, which since their Subjection to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Government, they had most cruelly sustained. And seeing the Birth and Quality of his Grandfather <HI>Owen Tudor</HI> was called in question, and that he was by many upbraided of being of a mean and ignoble Parentage; King <HI>Henry</HI> directed a Commission to the Abbot of <HI>Lhan Egwest,</HI> Dr. <HI>Owen Pool</HI> Canon of <HI>He∣reford,</HI> and <HI>John King</HI> Herald at Arms, to make in∣quisition concerning the Pedigree of the said <HI>Owen;</HI> who coming to <HI>Wales,</HI> made a diligent enquiry into this matter; and by the assistance of Sir <HI>John Leyaf, Guttyn Owen Bardh, Gruffydh ap Lhewelyn ap Efan Fychan,</HI> and others, in the consultation of the <HI>British</HI> Books of Pedegrees, they drew up an exact Genealo∣gy of <HI>Owen Tudor,</HI> which upon their return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd.</NOTE> they pre∣sented to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Edward,</HI> Son to <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, by the Lady <HI>Jane Seymour,</HI> his third Wife, was born at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> on the 12th of <HI>October;</HI> and upon the 18th. of the said Month, was created Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Duke of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, had already abrogated those unreasonable and intollerable Laws, which the former Kings of <HI>England,</HI> particularly <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, had made against the <HI>Welch;</HI> and now, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, willing to make a plenary Reformation of what his Father had wisely begun, thought it necessary towards the Good and Tranqui∣lity
<PB N="326" REF="200"/> of both Nations, to make the <HI>Welch</HI> subject to the same Laws, and the same Government with the <HI>English.</HI> He understood that the usual Hostilities and Depredations were still continued and kept up by both sides upon the Borders; and though his Fa∣ther had eased the Yoak of the <HI>Welch,</HI> yet he per∣ceived, that it did contribute but little towards the disannulling of that inveterate and implacable Envy and Animosity which raged in the Marches. There∣fore to remedy this, otherwise unavoidable, Distem∣per, he concluded that it was the only effectual Me∣thod, to incorporate the <HI>Welch</HI> with the <HI>English;</HI> that they being subject to the same Laws, might e∣qually <MILESTONE N="1536" UNIT="A.D."/> fear the Violation of them. And according∣ly, in the Twenty Seventh Year of his Reign, an Act of Parliament passed to that purpose, which to∣gether with another Act in the Thirty Fifth of his Reign, made a plenary Incorporation of the <HI>Welch</HI> with the <HI>English,</HI> which Union has had that blessed Effect, that it has dispelled all those unnatural Diffe∣rences which heretofore were so rife and irreconcilable.</P>
<P>When the Reformation was first established in <HI>Wales,</HI> it was a mighty Inconveniency to the vulgar People, such as were unacquainted with the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, that the Bible was not translated into their native Language. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was quickly ap∣prehensive of the Inconveniency which the <HI>Welch</HI> in∣curred, for the want of such a Translation; and there∣fore, <MILESTONE N="1566" UNIT="A.D."/> in the Eighth Year of her Reign, an Act of Parliament was passed, whereby the Bishops of <HI>He∣reford,</HI> S. <HI>Davids,</HI> S. <HI>Asaph, Bangor,</HI> and <HI>Landaff,</HI> were ordered to take care that the Bible containing the Old and New Testament, with the Book of Common-Prayer, and Administration of the Sacra∣ments, be truly and exactly translated into the <HI>British</HI> or <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue, and that the same so translated, being by them perused and approved, be printed to such a number at least; as that every Cathedral, Col∣legiate and Parish-Church and Chappel of ease with∣in the said Diocess where that Tongue is vulgarly spoken, might be supplyed before the First of <HI>March,
<PB N="327" REF="200"/> Anno</HI> 1566. And from that time forward, the <HI>Welch</HI> Divine Service should be used in the <HI>British</HI> Tongue, in all places throughout those Diocesses, where the <HI>Welch</HI> is commonly spoke, after the same manner as it was used in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue; and that the Charge of procuring the said Bible and Common-Prayer, should equally depend betwixt the Parson and the Parish; the former being obliged to pay one half of the Expence; and that the Price of the Book should be set by the foresaid Bishops, or by Three of them at the least. But this Act of Parliament was not punctually observed; for the Old Testament was wholly omitted, and only the New, with the Book of Common-Prayer and Administration of the Sacra∣ments, then translated, which Translation was chief∣ly owing to <HI>Richard</HI> Bishop of S. <HI>Davids,</HI> who was assisted by <HI>William Salusbury,</HI> a Perfect Critick in the <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue, and one excellently conversant in all <HI>British</HI> Antiquities. But in the Year 1588. Dr. <HI>Wil∣liam Morgan,</HI> first Bishop of <HI>Landaff,</HI> and then of S. <HI>Asaph,</HI> undertook the Translation of the whole Bi∣ble; and by the help of the Bishops of S. <HI>Asaph</HI> and <HI>Bangor, Gabriel Goodman</HI> Dean of <HI>Westminster, David Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> D.D. <HI>Edmund Price</HI> Archdeacon of <HI>Merionyth,</HI> and <HI>Richard Va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghan,</HI> he effectually finished it. This was of singular Profit and Advantage to the <HI>Welch,</HI> to have the whole Scripture read and perused in their own native Tongue; by which means they received a clearer demonstration of the Corruptions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> when they saw many of their Prin∣ciples apparently contradicting, and others not very firmly founded upon the Holy Scriptures. And on the other hand they perceived the Necessity and Advan∣tage of the Reformation, they easily discovered that the whole Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> was sound and orthodox, and that they were now happi∣ly delivered from that Popish Slavery which their Forefathers ignorantly adored; and therefore being convinced of the Truth of their Religion, they be∣came, and continued generally, very strict Adherents and firm Observers of the Doctrine and Discipline of this Church.</P>
<PB N="328" REF="201"/>
<P>And here by the bye, I cannot but observe what a reverend Writer has lately insinuated, relating to the Christian Religion planted in <HI>Wales.</HI> For that Learn∣ed Person in his Funeral Sermon upon Mr. <HI>Gouge,</HI> would fain induce the World to believe, that Chri∣stianity was very corrupt and imperfect among the <HI>Welch,</HI> before it was purifyed by that, whom he terms Apostolical Man. Whereas it is notoriously evident, that since the Reformation was setled in that Country, and the Bible, with the Book of Com∣mon-Prayer, translated into the <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue, no place has been more exact, in keeping to the strict Rubrick and Constitution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both as to the Substance and Form of Worship. But what may more truly be attributed to Mr. <HI>Gouge,</HI> is that since his Travels into <HI>Wales,</HI> and the propagating of his Doctrine among the ignorant of that Country, Presbytery, which before had scarce taken root, has daily increased, and grown to a Head.</P>
<P><HI>Henry,</HI> eldest Son of King <HI>James</HI> the First, being arrived to the Age of Seventeen Years, was created Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> on the 30th. of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 1610, but he dying of a malignant Feaver, about Two Years after; his Brother <HI>Charles</HI> being Fifteen Years of Age, was created Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in his room, <HI>Anno</HI> 1615. For joy of this new Creation, the Town of <HI>Ludlow,</HI> and City of <HI>London,</HI> performed very great Triumphs; and the more to honour this Solemnity, the King made Twenty Five Knights of the Bath, all Lords or Barons Sons; and the Inns of Court, to express their Joy, elected out of their Body Forty choice Gentlemen, to perform solemn Justs and Bar∣ryers.</P>
<P><HI>Charles,</HI> eldest Son of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, by <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> Daughter to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth of <HI>France,</HI> was born <HI>May</HI> 29. 1630. and afterwards created Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Since the happy Incorporation of the <HI>Welch</HI> with the <HI>English,</HI> the History of both Nations, as well as the People is united; and therefore I shall not re∣peat that which is so copiously and frequenty deli∣vered
<PB N="329" REF="201"/> by the <HI>English</HI> Historians; but shall conclude with Dr. <HI>Heylyn. That since the</HI> Welch <HI>have been in∣corporated with the</HI> English, <HI>they have shewed themselves most loyal, hearty, and affectionate Subjects of the State; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ordially devoted to their King, and zealous in Defence <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their Laws, Liberties, and Religion, as well as any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the best of their Fellow-Subjects.</HI></P>

<P>REveredissimo Patri in Christo Domino J. De gratia Cantuariensi Archiepiscopo totius An∣gliae Primati, suus humilis &amp; devotus filius Leolinus Princeps Walliae, Dominus Snaudon, salutem &amp; filia∣lem dilectionem cum omnimoda reverentia, subjectio∣ne &amp; honore, sanctæ paternitati vestræ pro labore vobis quasi intolerabile quem assumpsistis ad præsens pro dilectione quam erga nos &amp; nostram nationem geritis, omni qua possumus devotione regratiantes vo∣bis assurgimus; &amp; eo amplius quod contra Domini re∣gis voluntatem venistis prout nobis intimastis. Cæ∣terum quod nos rogastis ut ad pacem Domini regis veniamus, scire debet vestra sanctitas quod ad hoc prompti sumus, dummodo idem dominus rex pacem de∣bitam &amp; veram nobis &amp; nostris velit observare. Ad hoc licet gauderemus de mora vestra facienda in Wallia, tamen per nos non eritis impediti quin pax fiat, quantum in nobis est, quam optamus per vestram industriam magis quam alicujus alterius roborari. Et speramus nec per Dei gratiam erit opportunum propter nostram pertinaciam aliquid scribere Domino Papæ. Nec vestras paternas preces ac graves labores sper∣nemus, sed eas amplectimur omni cordis affectu ut tenemur. Nec erit opus quod Dominus Rex aggra∣vet contra nos manum, cum prompti sumus sibi obe∣dire juribus nostris &amp; legibus nobis ut præmittatur re∣servatis.</P>
<P>Et licet regnum Angliæ sit Curiæ Romanæ specia∣liter subjectum &amp; dilectum, tamen cum Dominus Pa∣pa, necnon &amp; Curia Romana audiverint quanta no∣bis per Anglicos mala sunt illata, videlicet quod pax prius formata non fuit nobis servata nec pacta; de∣inde devastationes, combustiones, &amp; Ecclesiasticarum personarum interfectiones, sacerdotum videlicet &amp; in∣clusorum, &amp; aliarum religiosarum personarum passim mulierum &amp; infantium suggentium ubera &amp; in utero portantium, combustiones etiam hospitalium &amp; aliarum domorum religiosarum, homicidiorum in cœmiteriis, Ecclesiis, &amp; super Altaria, &amp; aliorum sacrilegiorum &amp; flagiciorum auditu etiam horribilium, auditu Pagano∣rum
<PB N="366" REF="220"/> sicut expressius in aliis rotulis conscripta vobis transmittimus inspicienda.</P>
<P>Speramus imprimis, quod vestra pia &amp; sancta pa∣ternitas clementer nobis compatietur, nec non &amp; Cu∣ria supra dicta, nec per nos regnum Angliæ vacillabit, dum, ut promissum est, pax debita nobis fiat &amp; ser∣vetur. Qui vero sanguinis effusione delectantur ma∣nifestum est factis. Nam Anglici hactenus nulli se∣xui vel aetati seu languori pepercerunt, nulla Eccle∣siae vel loco sacro detulerunt, qualia vel consimilia Wallenses non fecerunt. Super eo autem quod unus redemptus fuit interfectus, multum dolemus, nec oc∣cisorem manu tenemus, sed in sylvis uti latro vagatur. De eo vero quod inceperunt guerram aliqui in tem∣pore indebito, illud ignoravimus usque post factum, &amp; tamen ipsi asserunt quod nisi eo tempore hoc fe∣cissent mortes &amp; captiones eis imminebunt, nec au∣debunt in domibus residere, nec nisi armati incedere, &amp; sic præ timore tali tempore id fecerunt. De eis verò quae fecimus contra Dominum, ut veri Chri∣stiani per Dei gratiam pœnitebimus, nec erit ex par∣te nostra quod bellum continuetur, dum sumus in∣demnes ut debemus. Ne tamen exhæredemur &amp; pas∣sim occidemur, oportet nos defendere ut valemus. Cum verò injuria &amp; damna hinc inde considerentur &amp; ponderentur parati sumus emendare pro viribus quæ ex parte nostra sunt commissa, dum de praedictis injuriis &amp; damnis nobis factis &amp; aliis emenda nobis fiat. Et ad pacem firmandam &amp; stabiliendam simi∣liter sumus prompti debitis modis.</P>
<P>Quando tamen regales chartæ &amp; pacta inita nobis non servatur, sicut nec hucusque sunt observata, non potest pax stabiliri, nec quando novæ exactiones &amp; inauditæ contra nos &amp; nostros omni die adveniunt. Vobis autem transmittimus in rotulis damna nobis illata &amp; fœdera non servata secundum formam pacis prius factam. Quod verò guerravimus quasi necessi∣tas nos cogebat; Nam nos &amp; omnes Wallenses era∣mus adeo oppressi &amp; suppeditati &amp; spoliati &amp; in ser∣vitutem redacti per regales Justicianos &amp; Ballivos con∣tra formam pacis &amp; omnem justiciam amplius quam
<PB N="367" REF="220"/> si Saraceni essemus vel Judæi, sicut credimus &amp; sæpe denunciavimus Domino Regi nec aliquam emendam habere potuimus. Sed semper mittebantur justiciarii &amp; ballivi ferociores &amp; crudeliores, &amp; quando illi erant saturati per suas injustas exactiones, alii de no∣vo mittebantur ad populum excoriandum in tantum quod populus mallebat mori quam vivere. Nec opor∣tet militiam ampliorem convocare, vel contra nos mo∣veri Sacerdotium dum nobis fiat pax &amp; servetur mo∣dis debitis ut superius est expressum. Nec debitis san∣cte pater omnibus verbis credere nostrorum adversario∣rum; sicut enim nos factis oppresserunt &amp; opprimunt, ita &amp; vobis diffamant, nobis imponentes quæ volunt.</P>
<P>Ipsi enim vobis sunt præsentes &amp; nos absentes, ipsi opprimentes &amp; nos oppressi. Et ideò propter Deum fidem eis in omnibus non exhibeatis, sed facta potius examinetis. Valeat sanctitas vestra ad regimen Eccle∣siae per tempora longa.</P>
<P><HI>Primus Articulus</HI> est talis, Cum in forma pacis sic contineatur ut sequitur. Si vero idem Leolinus jus vendicaverit in aliquibus terris quas alii præter di∣ctum dominum Regem occupaverint extra quatuor Cantredos prædictos, pleniariam sibi justitiam exhibe∣bit præsatus dominus Rex secundum leges &amp; consue∣tudines partium illarum in quibus terræ illæ consistunt: qui Articulus non fuit observatus super terris Arwyst∣ley &amp; inter Dyvy &amp; ductus fluviorum, pro eo quod cum Dominus Leolinus dictas terras vendicasset co∣ram Domino Rege apud Ruthlan, &amp; Rex sibi con∣cessisset causam examinare secundum leges &amp; consue∣tudines Walliae ac advocati pretium fuissent introdu∣cti coram Rege ut judicarent de dictis terris secun∣dum leges Wallicanas; parte rea comparente &amp; re∣spondente adeo quod eo die deberet finaliter termi∣nari ex præfixione Domini Regis qui apud Glover∣niam existens diem prædictum partibus assignavit, li∣cet sæpius in diversis locis coram justiciariis fuisset dicta causa examinata, &amp; terræ ipsæ essent in pura Wallia. Nec unquam judicata fuit super eis nisi se∣cundum leges Wallicanas; Nec Dominus Rex posset
<PB N="368" REF="221"/> vel deberet prorogare nisi secundum leg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Walliæ: Diem tamen ipsum motu proprio prorogavit &amp; contra leges antedictas, &amp; ad ultimo fuit vocatus ad loca va∣ria ad quae non debuit evocari, nec justitiam obtinere potuit, nisi secundum leges Angliæ contra illud quod in dicto Articulo continetur. Et idem factum fuit coram justiciariis apud Montgomery, cum partes es∣sent in judicio constitutæ &amp; firmatæ, &amp; dies datus ad sententiam audiendam, diem prorogaverunt leges me∣moratas. Demum apud Londinum post multos labo∣res &amp; expensas varias Rex ipse justitiam sibi denega∣vit, nisi vellet secundum leges Angliæ subire judicium in causa memorata.</P>
<P><HI>Secundus Articulus</HI> non servatus est talis. Et omnes transgressiones injuriæ &amp; excelsus hinc inde factæ pœ∣nitus remittuntur usque in diem hodiernum. Iste Ar∣ticulus non fuit observatus quia Dominus Reginaldus de Grey statim cum fuit factus Justiciarius, movit va∣rias quæstiones &amp; innumerabiles contra homines de Tegengl, &amp; nos super transgressis quæ factæ fuerunt in tempore Domini Henrici Regis, &amp; dicti Domini Leolini dum Dominum in partibus illis obtinebat un∣de dicti homines multum timentes non audebant i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> domibus suis permanere.</P>
<P><HI>Tertius Articulus,</HI> Ubi dictus Rys Vachan filius <HI>Nefi</HI> filii Maelgon cum terra quam nunc tenet &amp; cum post pacem initam fuit spoliatus de terra de Gene∣verglyn, quam tunc tenebat cum hominibus &amp; Ave∣riis eorundem.</P>
<P><HI>Quartus Articulus,</HI> Item concedit Dominus Rex quod omnes terras tenentes in quatuor Cantredis, &amp; in aliis terris quas Dominus Rex retinet in manu sua, teneant eas adeo libere &amp; pleniarie sicut ante gue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ram tenere consueverint, &amp; eisdem libertatibus &amp; consuetudinibus gaudeant quibus prius gaudere sole∣bant, &amp; cum contra istum Articulum dictus Reginal∣dus consuetudines varias de novo introduxit, &amp; hoc contra pacis formam supradictam.</P>

<PB N="369" REF="221"/> Marchiæ de his quae emergunt in Marchia, &amp; secun∣dum leges Walliæ de rebus contentiosis quæ in Wal∣lia orientur. Contra istum Articulum venit Dominus Rex mittendo Justiciarios usque ad Montgomery, qui ibidem judicare præsumpserunt homines dicti Leolini, <HI>vindictam</HI> ponendo super illos contra leges Walliæ, cum hoc vel aliud simile nunquam factum fuisset ibidem temporibus retroactis, quosdam incar∣cerando, alios in exilium mittendo, cum ipse idem Princeps paratus esset de eisdem hominibus suis ex∣hibere justitiæ complementum omnibus quærelantibus de eisdem.</P>
<P>Item <HI>Sextus Articulus.</HI> Item cum sit contentum in dicta pacis forma, quod Griffinus Vachan homa∣gium faceret Domino Regi, de terra, de Yâl, &amp; principi de terra de Edeyrnahu Justiciarii Domini in∣troduxerunt in totam terram prædictam de Edeyrna∣hu cujus cognitio causae ad Principem pertinebat sim∣pliciter, &amp; non ad illos Justiciarios; &amp; tamen pro bo∣no pacis princeps hoc tolerabat cum ipse Princeps pa∣ratus esset eidem Dominae super hoc justitiam exhi∣bere.</P>
<P><HI>Septimus Articulus,</HI> ubi dicitur &amp; licet idem Prin∣ceps se nostræ ut dictum est supposuerit voluntati, nos tamen concedimus &amp; volumus quod voluntas no∣stra ..... ultra dictos Articulos se in aliquo non extendant. Contra istum Articulum exigebatur Au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um ad opus Reginæ in qualibet solutione facta Regi¦cum .....

Item cum invitâsset Dominus Rex dictum Principem adfectum Wiggor∣niensem verbis blandissimis promittendo ei quod daret tunc consanguineam suam sibi in uxorem, &amp; multis di∣taret honoribus; Nihilominus cum illuc venisset in die desponsationis, ante missam petiit Dominus Rex unam literam consignari à Principe continentem inter cæ∣tera, quod idem Princeps nullum omnino honorem in terra sua teneret contra Regis voluntatem, vel manu teneret ex quo possit contingere quod omnes fideles Principis ab eo commoverentur. Quam quidem lite∣ram sibi sigillatam tradidit, computans per metum qui cadere posset in constantem virum, cum tamen in for∣ma pacis, ut praemissum est, contineatur quod nihil ab eo deberet exigi, ultra quod in dicta forma conti∣netur.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> Cum secundum eandem pacis formam consue∣tudines eidem Principi confirmentur quibus usus fue∣rat ab antiquo; ac idem Princeps &amp; Antecessores sui, ex consuetudine diutina &amp; obtenta bona de naufra∣giis in terris suis provenientia consueverant recipere, &amp; in suos usus convertere ad libitum: Justiciarius Cestrensis <HI>namium</HI> recepit super Principem pro bonis quæ recepit de naufragiis ante guerram contra dictam pacis formam per quam hinc inde erant remissa, &amp; contra consuetudines ante dictas. Dato etiam quod hoc esset foris factum <HI>namium</HI> recepit tale, videlicet quindecem libratas mellis &amp; plures equos ac homines suos incarceravit, &amp; hoc ex propriis bonis Principis antedicti. Preterea, accipit scaphas de Banweys quæ venerant apud Liverpol cum mercandiis per mercato∣res, &amp; eas numquam deliberavit donec pecuniam pro eis accepit quantum volebat.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> Cum quidam homines de Geneurglyn quædam bona abstulissent ab aliis vicinis suis de Geneu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glyn, dum essent in Dominio Principis de Merpyreton homi∣nes Regis de Llanbadarn prœdam fecerunt, &amp; acce∣perunt de terra Principis de Merpyreton, &amp; cum ho∣mines sui venissent illuc ad quærendum quare dictam p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ædam receperant, unum de eis interfecerunt, &amp;
<PB N="371" REF="222"/> alios vulnera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erunt, &amp; quosdam incarceraverunt. Et cum in dicta pacis forma contineatur quod in Marchia deberent emendari quae in Marchia committebantur, tamen dicti homines Regis homines Principis audire noluerunt alibi quam in Castro de Llanbadarn, &amp; hoc contra pacis formam antedictam, super quo hactenus nullam justitiam habere potuerunt. In istis Articulis injuriatus Dominus Rex Principi &amp; suis, &amp; etiam in multis aliis: Et licet Princeps tam per se quam per suos petivisset saepius à Domino Rege quod pacis for∣mam supradictam erga se &amp; suos faceret observari, in nullo tamen extitit observata sed omni die de novo Justiciarii &amp; Ballivi Domini Regis in partibus illis in∣jurias injuriis, &amp; varia gravamina cumulaverunt; pro∣pter quod mirum non debet videri alicui si Princeps præfatus assensum præstitit illis qui guerrare cœperunt, cum in his fides quam in animam Domini Regis sibi Dominus Robertus Tibetot juraverat in nullo servaba∣tur, &amp; maxima &amp; principaliter cum Princeps fuisser præmunitus à personis fide dignis quod Princeps fo∣ret à Rege capiendus in suo primo accessu apud Ruth∣lan, &amp; etiam fuisset captus si Rex illuc accessisset post Natale sicut proposuerat.</P>
<P>Nec gravamina &amp; alia quasi innumerabilia, sancte Pater, considerantes, nobis affectu paterno compacia∣mini, &amp; pro salute animæ Domini Regis, &amp; nostræ, &amp; etiam multorum aliorum, ad pacem bonam utrius∣que populi laboretis fructuosè.</P>
<P>Cum Dominus David primo venisset ad Dominum Edwardum tunc Comitem Cestriæ, ac homagium si∣bi fecisset, idem Dominus Edwardus eidem Davidi duas Cantredas, videlicet de dyffryn-Clwyd &amp; Cywo∣nant cum omnibus suis pertinentiis dedit plenarie, &amp; literas suas patentes super hoc fieri fecit, tandem etiam donationem eidem invocavit, postquam creatus est in Regem, &amp; etiam illum Davidem in possessionem illa∣rum Cantredarum induxit corporalem.</P>

Et licet dictus Do∣minus David petivisset multoties quod injuriose contra eundem non procederetur in dicto comitatu, pro eo quod ibidem respondere nullatenus tenebatur super villis prædictis quæ sitæ erant in Wallia, sed potius tractaretur, hoc sibi plane denegavit.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> Idem Justiciarius Cestriensis in gravamen di∣cti Domini Davidis nemus suum de Lleweni &amp; Syl∣vas suas de Hope fecit succidi tam per villanos de Ruthlan, quam per alios, cum idem Justiciarius in ter∣ris prædicti Domini Davidis nullam omnino haberet jurisdictionem, &amp; non contenti quod <HI>meremium</HI> ibi∣dem quærerent ad ædificia exigenda tam apud Rode∣lanum quam alibi in patria, sed nemus destruendo <HI>meremium</HI> ibidem sectum ad vendendum in Hyber∣niam transtulerunt.</P>

Post varios autem tractatus respondit princeps; quod paratus erat voluntati regiæ se supponere duobus præ∣suppositis, salva scilicet conscientia sua qua populo suo assistere tenebatur; salva etiam condescentia status fui. Quæ cum Archiepiscopus retulisset Domino Regi, respondit Dominus Rex quod nullum alium de pace volebat cum Principe ac subditis suis habere tracta∣tum, nisi quod ipsi supponerent se in omnibus regiæ voluntati: Et cum constaret Archiepiscopo Wallenses nullo modo velle se regiæ voluntati supponere, nisi præcite in forma eis tolerabili &amp; accepta, tractatum habuit ex permissione Domini Regis cum magnatibus tunc præsentibus, qui omnes consenserunt in Articu∣los infra scriptos, quos per fratrem Johannem Wal∣lensem inscriptos principi &amp; suis Archiepiscopus desti∣navit.</P>
<P><HI>Primo.</HI> Quod Dominus Rex de quatuor Cantredis &amp; terris ab eo datis, Magnatibus suis nullum vult ha∣bere tractatum, nec etiam de Insula Anglesey.</P>
<P><HI>Idem.</HI> De tenentibus eorum Cantredorum si ad suam pacem venerint, proponit facere prout condecet Regiam Majestatem, credimus tamen quod aget cum eis misericorditer si ad pacem venerint, &amp; ad hoc proponimus una cum cæteris amicis efficaciter laborare, sperantes efficaciter exaudiri.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> De facto Domini Lewelini nullum potuimus aliud habere responsum nisi quod simpliciter &amp; absolute conformet ad Domini Regis voluntatem; ut credimus firmiter quod Dominus Rex cum eo aget miserecor∣diter, &amp; ad hoc intendimus cum totis viribus laborare cum cæteris amicis exaudiendis ut confidimus cum effectu.</P>
<P><HI>Primo.</HI> Quod proceres hanc formam gratiæ regiæ conceperunt; ut videlicet Domino Lewelino se Regiæ gratiæ submittente, provideatur ei per Regem hono∣rifice
<PB N="390" REF="232"/> in mille libratis sterlingorum de aliquo honori∣fico comitatu, in aliquo loco Angliæ; ita tamen quod prædictus Lewelinus ponat Dominum Regem in <HI>Seysina</HI> Snaudonum absolute, perpetue &amp; quiete. Et ipse Rex filiæ Principis secundum condicestiam sui proprii San∣guinis providebit, &amp; ad hoc sperant se posse Regis ani∣mum inclinare.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Si contingat Lewelinum ducere uxorem &amp; habere de ea puellam masculam, intendunt impe∣trare Proceres à Domino Rege, ut proles illa succe∣dat perpetuo haereditario Lewelini in terra masculo∣rum liberorum videlicet Comitatu.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> De populo Principi immediate subjecto tam in Snaudon quam alibi providebitur secundum Deum p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out complete saluti ejusdem populi &amp; honori; &amp; ad hoc est Regia clementia satis prona, populo deside∣rans consolabiliter providere.</P>
<P><HI>Primò.</HI> Quod si ad honorem Dei &amp; suum juxta crucis assumptæ debitum velit in terræ sanctæ subsi∣dium proficisci, providebitur ei honorifice secundum condescentiam Status sui, ita tamen quod non redeat nisi per Regiam clementiam vocatus: Rogabimus etiam Dominum Regem, &amp; speramus efficaciter ex∣audiri, ut provideat proli suæ.</P>
<P>His omnibus motu nostro subjungimus Wallensi∣bus omnia pericula imminere longe gravius quam eis diximus oraculo vivæ vocis; scribimus dura valde sed longe durius est obrui vi &amp; armis, &amp; in fine totaliter extirpari, quoniam omni die pericula nobis imminen∣tia aggravantur.</P>

<P>SAncte Pater, sicut vosmet consuluistis, ad gratiam Regiam parati sumus venire sub forma tamen nobis secura &amp; honesta: Sed quia fotma contenta in Articulis nobis missis minime secura est &amp; honesta prout nobis &amp; consilio nostro videtur; &amp; de qua multum admirantur omnes audientes, eo quod plus tendit ad destructionem &amp; ruinam populi nostri ac nostram, quam ad nostram honestatem &amp; securitatem, nullo modo permittet consilium nostrum nos in ea con∣sentire si vellemus; alii quoque Nobiles &amp; populus nobis subjectus nullo modo consentirent in eandem ob indubitatam destructionem &amp; dissipationem quæ inde eis possent evenire.</P>
<P>Tamen supplicamus vestræ sanctæ parternitati qua∣tenus ad reformationem pacis debitæ, honestæ, &amp; se∣cutæ, ob quam tot labores assumpsistis, proinde labo∣retis, collationem habentes ad Articulos quos vobis mittimus in scriptis: Honorabilius enim est &amp; rationi magis consonum ut de Domino Rege teneamus terras in quibus jus habemus, quam nos exhæredare &amp; eas tradere alienis. Datum apud Garthcelyn.</P>
<P><HI>Primo.</HI> Quod licet Dominus Rex de quatuor Can∣tredis &amp; aliis terris ab eo datis magnatibus suis, ac de Insula Anglesey nullum voluerit habere tractatùm, tamen consilium Principis non permittit, si contingat aliquam pacem fieri, quin tractetur de premissis; eo quod isti Cantredi sunt de puro Principis tenemento, in quibus merum jus habuerunt Principes &amp; præde∣cessores sui à temporibus Cambri filii Bruti, tum quia sunt de principatu, cujus confirmationem Princeps

<P>Dicunt etiam comiter omnes tenentes de omnibus Cantredis Walliæ quod non sunt ausi venire ad volun∣tatem Regis, ut de eis disponat secundum Regiam Ma∣jestatem.</P>
<P><HI>Primo.</HI> Quod Dominus Rex nec pacta, nec jura∣menta, nec Chartas servavit ab initio versus Domi∣num suum Principem &amp; ipsos,</P>
<P><HI>Secundo.</HI> Quia regales in Ecclesias &amp; Ecclesia∣sticas personas inivit crudelissimam tyrannidem.</P>
<P><HI>Tertio.</HI> Quod non tenentur ad prædicta, cum sint homines Principis qui etiam paratus est de dictis te∣nementis Domino Regi obedire per servitia consueta. Ad id quod dicit quod Princeps veniet simpliciter &amp; absolute ad voluntatem Domini Regis: Respon∣detur quod cum nulli de dictis Cantredis ausi sint venire ad talem voluntatem propter causas prædictas, nec comitas eorum permittat Principem venire ad di∣ctam voluntatem modo prædicto.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Quod proceres regni procurent ut Domino Principi provideatur in mille libratis in aliquo loco Angliæ; dicatur quod illam provisionem non debet acceptare cum sit procurata per dictos proceres, qui nituntur ad exhæreditationem Principis, ut habeant terras suas in Wallia. Item idem princeps non tene∣tur dimittere hæreditatem suam &amp; progenitorum suo∣rum in Wallia à tempore Bruti, &amp; etiam sibi confir∣matam per Romanæ sedis Legatum, ut dictum est; &amp; terram in Anglia acceptare, unde linguam, mores &amp; leges ac consuetudines ignorat; ubi possent etiam sibi quædam malitiori imponi ex odio inveterato à vici∣nis Anglicis quibus terra illa privaretur in perpe∣tuum.</P>
<PB N="393" REF="233"/>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Ex quo Rex proponit privare Principem sua pristina hæreditate, non videtur probabile quod Rex permitteret ei habere terram in Anglia ubi nul∣lum jus videtur habere. Et si etiam non permittere∣tur Principi terra sterilis &amp; inculta jure hæreditario ab antiquo &amp; debita in Wallia; nullatenus permitteretur eidem in Anglia terra fertilis culta &amp; habundans.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Quod dictus Princeps ponat Dominum Re∣gem in <HI>Seysino</HI> Snawdon absolute, perpetue &amp; quiete: Dicatur quod cum Snawdon sit de appendiciis princi∣patus Walliæ, quem ipse &amp; antecessores sui tenuerunt à tempore Bruti, ut dictum est; consilium suum non permittit eum renuntiare dicto loco, &amp; locum nimis sibi debitum in Anglia receptare.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> Populus Snawdon dicit, quod licet Princeps vellet dare Regi <HI>Seysinam</HI> eorundem, ipsi tamen nol∣lent homagium facere alicui extraneo, cujus linguam, mores, legesque penitus ignorant. Quia sic posset contingere eos in perpetuum captivari, ac crudeliter tractari, sicut alii Cantredi circumquaque per Balli∣vos Regis ac alios regales alias tractati fuerunt, cru∣delius quam Saraceni; prout patet in rotulis quos vo∣bis, miserunt sancte pater. Ista sunt dicenda pro Da∣vide fratre Principis. Quod cum voluerit terram sanctam adire hoc faciet voluntarie &amp; ex voto pro Deo non pro homine, unde invitus non peregrinabitur Deo dante; Qui coacta servitia Deo novit displicere. Et si contingat ipsum in posterum terram sanctam adire bona ductus voluntate, non propter hoc deberent ipse &amp; hæredes sui in perpetuum exhæreditari; immò potius præmium obtinere. Præterea quia Princeps, &amp; sui causa odii, ad aliquos concipiendi, vel lucri captandi non moverunt guerram alienas terras in∣vadendo; sed suam propriam hæreditatem jura li∣bertatesque, necnon suorum defendendo; Dominus∣que Rex &amp; sui odio inveterato, &amp; causa lucrandi ter∣ras nostras guerram fecit: Credimus in hoc justam guerram nos fovere, &amp; speramus in hac Deum nos velle juvare, ac in Ecclesiarum devastatores divinam ultionem convertere, qui Ecclesias funditus destruxe∣runt ac combusserunt, sacra ex eis rapuerunt, Sacer∣dotes,
<PB N="394" REF="234"/> Clericos religiosos, claudos, surdos, mutos, in∣santes, ubera lactentes, ac debiles &amp; miserabiles perso∣nas, ut usque sexu occiderunt; &amp; alia enormia per∣petrarunt, sicut in dictis rotulis vobis transmissis conti∣neatur: Unde absit à sancta paternitate vestra senten∣tiam aliquam fulminare in alios quam in illos qui præ∣dicta perpetrârunt. Nos enim qui regalibus prædicta passi fuimus, speramus à vobis super præmissis paternum solatium, &amp; remedium obtinere; &amp; in prædictos sa∣crilegos eorumque fautores, qui nullo super his privi∣legio defenduntur, animadvertere; ne præ defectu dignæ correctionis seu ultionis in eos exercendo prædi∣cta mala in perpetuum per alios trahantur in exemplum.</P>
<P>Mirantur etiam quamplures in terra nostra, quod consuluistis nobis dimittere terram nostram propriam, &amp; alienam adire inter hostes nostros comersando; quia ex quo non possumus pacem habere in terra quæ no∣stra est ipso jure nostro, minime poterimus in aliena terra inter hostes nostros pacifice conservari: Et licet durum sit in guerra &amp; insidiis vitam ducere; durius ta∣men est funditus destrui, &amp; ad nihilum, nisi Deus a∣vertat, deduci populum Christianum qui nihil aliud quærit nisi sua jura defendere; Unde necessitas ad hoc nos cogit, &amp; inimicorum cupiditas non offendit; &amp; vos, sancte pater, coram nobis dixistis, quod vos sententia∣stis in omnes qui impediunt pacem causa odii vel lucri; sed manifestum est qui sunt illi qui guerrant istis causis.</P>
<P>Timor enim mortis, &amp; incarcerationis, vel perpe∣tuæ exhæreditationis, nulla observatio fœderum pa∣ctorum vel chartarum, tyrannica dominatio, vel multa alia consimilia cogunt nos esse in guerris; &amp; hoc Deo &amp; vobis ostendimus, &amp; petimus à vobis paternum ad∣jutorium, ut patet in literis nostris.</P>
<P>Ad hoc multi alii in regno Angliæ offenderunt Re∣gem &amp; tamen nullos exhæredavit in perpetuum, ut dicitur; unde si aliqui ex nostris ipsum offenderunt injuste, dignum est ut satisfaciant prout possint sine exhæredatione; &amp; sicut in vobis confidimus, supplica∣mus quod ad hoc laboretis sancte pater: Nam etsi nobis imponatur quod fregimus pacem, tamen illi ve∣rius fregerunt qui nullum fœdus vel pactum nobis ser∣vaverunt;
