<HEAD>¶ To the ryght woor∣shypfull, and hys synguler good Mayster, Mayster Thomas Steuckley Esquire, hys obedi∣dient seruaunt George North wysheth pros∣perous health, wyth encrease of muche worship.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>L aūcient Historiographers (my singuler good Mayster) for theyr difficult trauayl, merite most hye laud, whose famous woorkes re∣ueleth to our memory the secrete doinges of tyme past: and also bewrayeth to tyme pre∣sent, the vnknowen actes of oure Elders. For although by y<SUP>e</SUP> course of Nature, their bodies are kylled: yet lyueth theyr good or euyll deedes, in the euerlastyng report of let¦ters. Amonge these none deserueth more praise, nor worthy of more veneracion, then the most noble writer Sebastian Moūster: whose large labour greatlye surmounteth the doynges of any other. Thys Mounster both compendiously &amp; briefely (and yet elo∣quently and truly) entreateth, not onely of one, &amp; hys own natural soyle: but generally
<PB REF="3"/>of al Nacions, the situacion of their Coun∣tries, the maners of theyr people, wyth the ryghtes and vsages of their Princes. In whose volume it was my fortune to reade the description of Swedlande, Gothland, &amp; Finland. And findyng these Countries to be so large and fruitefull, theyr Kynges so noble and auncient, &amp; theyr people so migh∣ty and valiaunt. Consideryng the vertue of Princes to be a myrrour to looke on, &amp; their vices a terrour to thynke on, &amp; also for that swyft Fame hath published the reporte of these people vnto vs: I thoughte meete to reduce the same hystorye into our vulgare tounge, thoughe not so copiouslye and elo∣quentlye as any learned myght haue done. The situacion and naturall lying of theyr great and large Countries, the rytches, fer¦tillitye and fruitfulnes of the same, wyth theyr noble &amp; notable Cities, I haue brief∣ly ouerpassed. The old estate and auncient raygne of theyr Kinges, with theyr diuers and sundrye alteracions, sometyme by the Danes, sometyme by the Norwayes, and sometyme by deuision among them selues.
<PB REF="3"/>I haue in few words collected. But the hor¦rible and cruel tyranny of the second Chri∣stiern kyng of Denmarke, against the Swe¦cians, and hys iust reward for the same, the poleticke attaining of King Gostaue to the crowne, hys triumphant Coronacion, hys prudent gouernyng, with the vertuous pro¦uidyng for the education &amp; learned instruc∣tion of the moste noble Eric nowe Kyng of Swecia, I haue most amply declared. Ga∣thering the report hereof out of sundry Aut¦thors, as Iohn Magnus, Archbishoppe of Vpsalen, Saxus Grammaticus, and Seba¦stian Mounster, whose authoritye I haue chieflye folowed. Proferynge the same (to your worshyp) as the fruites of my trauail in your absence: acknowledging herewith∣al the remembraunce of my seruiceable deu∣ty and good wil to your Mastership, whose large &amp; ample benefites I haue not seldome tymes receyued, with your fauorable good∣nes, not onely to me, but also to euerye one, whose nede you knew to want your reliefe.

Besydes these your liberalities, your own trauel in foreyne &amp; straungenacions wyth the per∣fect vnderstandyng, &amp; almost natural spea∣kyng of theyr languages: importeth you to be as trym a Courtier, as you are knowen to be a worthy Soldiour. I woulde dilate your seueral vertues, but I feare to incurre your displeasure thereby, whose eares enui∣eth the hearing of your own praise, &amp; whose tounge thundreth oute the good fame of o∣thers. Also some sclaunderous Sicophāts would saye my pen dyd flowe rather wyth affection and flattery, then wyth troth and veritye. But to suche (as neuer learned to speake wel) I answer (that besides the part of a Seruaunt) I haue wayed more your inward natural inclinacion, then your out∣warde franke doynges, althoughe they are sufficient wytnesses wyth me of thys my reporte. Most humblye desiryng you to ac∣cept in good part thys my vnlearned labor, that I haue vnder the defence of your good¦nes
<PB REF="4"/>putin publycke prynt, whyche if it bee thankfully taken, may encourage me here∣after to attempt larger workes, whereby I truste as well to profyt my Countrye, as to content my selfe. Wyshinge the prosperous successe of Fortune to cal you to your harts desyre, wyth the fruitfull continuaunce of helth betwene you and my Mystres, whose goodnes both I and myne haue oftē tymes aboundauntly tasted, to whom I wysh lyke prosperitye. Whose mynde is frayted wyth a nomber of sober vertues.</P>

<P>Now for this traiterous conspiracy against the Swe¦cians, whose counsel was most woorst, that was best a∣lowed, &amp; whose tale tended to most tirannye, that was best lyked. For amonge all their diuelishe deuises thys

<P>This was thought by the whole consent &amp; societye of thys facinorous assemblye, to be the chiefe and perfecte meane for the vtter decay of the whole countrye.

<HEAD>¶ The descripcion of Finland, after the auc∣thoritie of Seba. Mounster.</HEAD>
<P>FInlande is called a fayre Countrye, because it is more plesaunter then Swecia. Plini seemeth to name it Finnonia, of the bowing arme or bosome of the sea Finnonicus. It is so large a Countrye, that it once was called a kyngdome, but now it hath onely the title of a Dukedome. The Sclauous in this passed age did inhabite there, whych nacion vsed the Grecian lan∣guage, so long as Moschus was Lorde ouer them. But now it is vnder the crown of Swecia, and doth vse the rites and ceremonies of the Western Churche. Muche wyne is transported thither, out of Spayne, by the sea Balthic, which the people of the Country much desy∣reth, onely to exhillerat their myndes. The inhabitants professed Christe after the Swecians, vnder Eric then king of Swecia. This Country doth excell Swedia, in corne and grain, both for plenty and goodnes, because it is for the most part playne, and not so fenny nor hylly as
<PB REF="27"/>Swecia is. There be trym townes in Finland, as Gu∣sta, a towne fortified for the warres, Abo their Byshops sea, Rasbing, Viburg, Karelia a Dukedome. Abo is not far distant from Vplandia, Viburg is situated at the ex¦treme borders and farthest boundes of all Fynlande, towards and against the Russes and Muschouites. It is the chiefe and principal place where theyr Soldiours and Garisous do lye, that defendes and kepes those peo¦ple from inuadyng the Countrye. It is also a Marte towne of great trafficke, whereunto the Ruthines doo often frequent. They saye that the Northe pole dothe ryse ouer this town, aboue the horisont <HI>.61.</HI> degrees and a halfe, and they nomber the length to be <HI>.78.</HI> They ac∣count the degrees of Stockeholme to be in breadth <HI>.61.</HI> and in length <HI>.64.</HI> The Finnons haue continual warres wyth the Muscouites in the arme or bosome of the sea Finnonicus: vsyng in Summer the ayde of Shyppes, and in Mynter they combat vpon the Ise. Howe popu∣lous was this Country and others lying aboute it, ma∣nye great and wyse men doo wytnes, as Methodius, Martir, Iordanus, Gothus, and Paulus Diaconus, the which Aucthors do wryte that this people dyd swarme out lyke Bees. And they call these Northe Regions the Store house or Garnar of Nacions, and chief∣lye of them are proce∣ded these names folowing.</P>

<P>The Inhabitantes of Fynland do speake twoo sun∣dry languages.
