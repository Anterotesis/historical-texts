<HEAD>From <HI>Rome</HI> Octob. <HI>18.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WEe told you before in our Newes, prin∣ted <HI>Nouember</HI> 7. That the Cardinall <HI>Lu∣douici</HI> had purchased the Dutchy of <HI>Zaragola,</HI> of the Duke of that place, for 800000. Crownes, which is againe confirmed by letters from <HI>Rome, October</HI> 18. and there is added, that after the Cardinall had gone through with his pur∣chase, that the Pope himselfe went from <HI>Frescati</HI> to see it. At this <HI>Frescati</HI> the Pope had most delicate and admirable deuices of Waterworkes, as forced Foun∣taines, Springs, Conduits, and the like, the most cu∣rious in the world.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Rome</HI> the same day.</HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Messina</HI> in <HI>Sicilia</HI> wee heare, That the Prince <HI>Philiberto</HI> hath sent a Galleon, with eight hundred <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> in it, towards <HI>Vado,</HI> for the State of <HI>Millan:</HI> But the people of <HI>Medena</HI> and <HI>Parmegia</HI> are vp in Armes, to stay the passage of any Warlike Bands, that should be brought that way; seeing that the great Duke of <HI>Tuscanie</HI> will send Forces to the ayde of the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> who feareth an inuasion from the Duke of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> because there is an Allyance betweene these two Dukes; the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> hauing marryed the Empe∣rours Sister, and the Emperour hauing lately marryed the Duke of <HI>Mantua's</HI> Daughter.</P>
<P>In <HI>Salerno</HI> in <HI>Sicilia,</HI> the great Marchants, <HI>Varnest</HI> and <HI>Como</HI> are broken for 60000 Crownes, and <HI>Iohn Baptista</HI> for 80000.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Venice,</HI> Octob. <HI>22.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Marcus Antonius de Dominis,</HI> the late Archbishop of <HI>Spalato,</HI> hauing lyen at <HI>Antwerpe</HI> some whiles, passed from thence homewards: and about the 20 of Octo∣ber was safely gotten to <HI>Millan</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> whence hee goes directly towards <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<HEAD>From <HI>Constantinople,</HI> Octob. <HI>3.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Letters from thence report these particulars following.</P>
<P>First, That there was arriued there an Embassadour out of <HI>Poland,</HI> who came with a stately trayne of an hundred followers. His Errand was, for confirmation of the League, and continuation of the Peace, in the Reigne of this present Sultan <HI>Mustapha;</HI> which was after the end of the late Warres, made betweene his King, and the former Sultan <HI>Osman.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That the purpose of making Warres against the King of <HI>Persia</HI> holds still: but that the preparations haue beene much hindered, and there haue fallen out many difficulties, which crosse the Tur∣kish intentions: The chiefe of which was, That hee hauing committed most of the preparations vnto the Bashaw of <HI>Babylon,</HI> because his Gouernment lyes next vnto <HI>Persia;</HI> the Natiues and Subiects of <HI>Babylon</HI> had before made their Bashaw to disobey the Great Turkes Commaunds in that point: And when hee since seemed willing to obey his Lord and Master, the <HI>Babylonians</HI> haue taken and burnt their Bashaw and <HI>Mufti</HI> (the <HI>Mufti</HI> being their chiefe Priest or Pope of the Mahometan Religion) and haue since chosen to themselues new Gouernours; whom, if the Grand Seignior shall offer to disturbe, or displace, they re∣solue to defend themselues against him, and to put themselues, for the more securitie, vnder the protec∣tion of the <HI>Sophi,</HI> or King of <HI>Persia;</HI> who, for some
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> differences in Religion, is still, and now especially, the mortallest and powerfullest Enemy that the Great Turke hath.</P>
<P>This is also confirmed by other Letters, which came by the way of <HI>Venice:</HI> which affirme also, That the Re∣bellion in <HI>Babylon</HI> is most certaine; and that the Ba∣shaw there (I take it, they meane the new Bashaw of the Peoples chusing) holds great correspondencie with the King of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, these disturbances in the Easterne parts of the Turkish Empire, were also much encreased by a Sedition in <HI>Egypt:</HI> Which Countrey also beeing vn∣der the Turkish Dominion, refused to accept of their new Bashaw, and made a most furious Faction against him; so that the whole Countrey was also ready to reuolt: but by the perswasion of the former Bashaw, then going out of his Office, the common people were something appeased, and entertayned their new Go∣uernour.</P>
<P>And thus you see the distractions of this huge and vaste Turkish Empire; which begins to change their Obedience, with the Murther of their former Prince: Which Seditions in the people, no doubt will be ea∣gerly apprehended by the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> who could willingly see euery one of the Bashawes (like the Captaines after <HI>Alexanders</HI> death) catch a share for himselfe, that so hee might be too strong for any one of them single; and at last, whilest they fight with him seuerally, hee might ouercome them all gene∣rally.</P>
</DIV1>

<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>From Algier, Octob. <HI>5.</HI></HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Algiers</HI> the Letters come by the way of <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> whence they write; that the two famous En∣glish Pyrats, Captaine <HI>Ward,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Sampson,</HI> and diuers others of their crew, are lately dead of the plague, which is extremely rife in many parts of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Algiers</HI> againe they write, that the Ambas∣sador of the States of the Low Countryes Doctor <HI>Pinacker,</HI> had so well sped himselfe in his ambassage, that he had obtained an agreement betwixt those of <HI>Algier,</HI> and the vnited Prouinces; and that hee had gotten libertie for diuers of his Countrimen, whom the Pyrats of <HI>Algier</HI> had taken at Sea, and made Gal∣ley-slaues of, which he hauing obtained here, went for the same purpose towards <HI>Thunis,</HI> to discharge those Dutchmen, who were there held either in the Prisons, or in the Galleys.</P>
<P>From <HI>Algier</HI> againe they write, that the Pyrats had 42. saile at sea, excellently well prouided: And that some of them had lately brought in a most rich Prize to <HI>Algier,</HI> which was a Spanish Carrick bound from <HI>Lisbone</HI> in <HI>Portugall,</HI> for the East Indies; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣in were found diuers Chests of money, of Gold and Siluer, &amp;c. And they brought in also another Spa∣nish Galleon, with 16. brasse and many yron peeces of Ordnance, manned also with 250. Souldiers and Sailers, and besides both these, they had gotten 4. other ships also.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>From Marsilia, Octob. <HI>27.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Some of the Galleys of <HI>Algiers</HI> haue done great hurt to ours hereabouts, and haue nere to <HI>Tarracona</HI> taken a Spanish vessell comming from <HI>Botri,</HI> and a∣nother from <HI>Marsilia,</HI> both richly laden; but the Ma∣riners saued themselues by getting a-shoare: But whiles the Pyrats were pillaging the Ships, certaine Spanish Galleys came and rescued them out of their hands.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Rome, Octob. <HI>18.</HI></HEAD>
<P>By the way of <HI>Rome</HI> also the newes comes from <HI>Algiers,</HI> that the Turkish Pyrates there haue lately taken a ship, comming from <HI>Noua Hispania,</HI> wherein were to the value of 20000. Crownes, and 200. men which were found aboard of her, were all made slaues.</P>
<P>Thus you heare, that though <HI>Ward</HI> and <HI>Sampson,</HI> be dead, yet the Turkes haue Pyrates and Rouers enough to trouble all the Merchants that trade that way.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Venice, Octob. <HI>28.</HI></HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Madrid</HI> in <HI>Spaine</HI> we heare, that the Duke <HI>de Alua,</HI> is departed the 20. of the last moneth towards <HI>Barcellona,</HI> to take vpon him the Viceroyes place, o∣uer the Kingdome of <HI>Naples.</HI> And that there are some Commissioners of the Kings priuie Counsell appointed to examine the Duke of <HI>Ossuna,</HI> vpon di∣uers particulars: This Duke <HI>de Ossuna,</HI> was the for∣mer
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> Viceroy of <HI>Naples,</HI> and for some misdemeanors brought in disfauour with the King of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>Hence also they write, that the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Master of the lease, or of the kings game, is declared Viceroy, or Lord Deputie of <HI>Barcellona,</HI> and Gouer∣nour of <HI>Millaine.</HI> Further they write, that the Duke of <HI>Pasterona</HI> is made Lord Chamberlaine of <HI>Spaine.</HI> And that the Count of <HI>Monteri</HI> was to haue an Am∣bassage towards <HI>Rome,</HI> with the entertainment of 30000. Crownes of yearely pension during that seruice.</P>
<P>There is also newes, that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath giuen the City of <HI>Matera</HI> vnto <HI>Don Gonzales de Cor∣dua,</HI> with the title of Prince, or Duke, as hee shall please to like best of.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Genoa, Octob. <HI>29.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Here are arriued 7. Galleys of the Duke <HI>de Oria,</HI> and 4. others belonging to our Common-wealth of <HI>Genoa,</HI> with the Duke <HI>de Alua,</HI> who is landed at <HI>Nis∣sa:</HI> from whence he dispatcht a Post to the Gouer∣nour of <HI>Millaine,</HI> desiring him to meet him at <HI>Final</HI> to conferre there together: But the Gouernour an∣swered him, that hee had yet receiued no order from <HI>Spaine</HI> to leaue <HI>Millaine.</HI> The said Galleyes haue brought a Million of Royalls of 8. out of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>From Leverno, Octob. <HI>30.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The good shippe called <HI>San Pietro</HI> is here arriued from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with very rich lading, and also the ship called <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> from <HI>Algiers,</HI> which a∣mongst other commodities, hath brought also two small bales of Diamonds.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Vienna, Octob. <HI>26.</HI></HEAD>
<P>On Saturday morning the <HI>Persian</HI> Ambassador comming hither, had Audience the next Sunday, his message is, to continue the league with his Emperiall Maiestie, which the father to this present King of <HI>Persia</HI> so much desired: It seemes this King purpo∣ses to make himselfe gracious with the Christians, and to giue certaine Christians of the Greeke religi∣on, freedome of conscience.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Breslaw in Silesia, Octob. <HI>27.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Plague is still so great and raging in the lower <HI>Hungary,</HI> that whole villages dye all vp of it.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Franckford. Nouemb. <HI>12.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We haue lately made mention of the surren∣dring vp of the Castle of <HI>Manheim</HI> to the Empe∣rour, which being performed, the Garrison marched out thence betwixt nine and eleuen a clocke in the
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> forenoone, hauing 10 Companies of English, and 14 Companies of Dutch, but yet nothing neere whole and full Companies. There were found in the Castle 5000 malter or sacks of corne, and 300 Fuder or Tuns of wine, and 52 peeces of Cannon; but as for powder, and such other prouision, nothing at all, for the besieged had bestowed that vpon their enemies before.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Franckford. Nouemb. <HI>18.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The siege of <HI>Franckendale</HI> yet continues, for they in the Towne being indifferently well prouided, purpose not to giue it ouer too suddenly, without honourable conditions. The Enemie hath not much dry ground to entrench himselfe vpon, so that the besieged care not much for him, vntill the hard frost comes, when the Enemie may both lye dry, and haue firme ground to draw his Ordnance, if the siege lasts so long, which is expected to be raised be∣fore that time.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Hamborough, Nouemb. <HI>12.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Since our last newes printed <HI>Nouemb.</HI> 21. wherein we told you of the resolute holding out of the siege of <HI>Glatz;</HI> we haue heard since, that that strong towne is surrendred to the Emperour, by the young Count of <HI>Tourne,</HI> who before so brauely defended it: But the particulars we yet haue not: Only thus much from <HI>Hamborough,</HI> that the young Count was
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> there arriued, with intention to goe into <HI>Holland,</HI> and that he was enforct to giue it vp for want of powder. But of this, the next faire winde, will (we hope) bring vs the particulars. In the meane time, you may please to obserue this, that the two strong peeces of <HI>Glatz</HI> and <HI>Manheim,</HI> were much about a time giuen ouer, not for want of valour, but for want of powder.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From the Dyet of Regenspurg.</HEAD>
<P>Here are also some letters in <HI>London,</HI> which re∣late, that the Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath inuaded the Count of <HI>Embdens</HI> country, vpon this quarrell (as it is thought) that he maintayned ten Companies for three months space in <HI>Spinolaes</HI> Armie, against the States and the Prince of <HI>Orange:</HI> And that the Marquesse <HI>Spinola</HI> hath sent vp forces to inuade the Duke of <HI>Holsteins</HI> country.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From Amsterdam, Nouemb. <HI>18.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (who we told you before in our last Newes, was gone vp) is now they say gone to take in <HI>Lingen,</HI> which Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had a farre off blocked vp before. That which may make this passe for truth is, for that <HI>Lingen</HI> (as we told you) was sometimes the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> owne inheritance, which he now desires much to recouer. The Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> is now got into <HI>Embden-land:</HI> He is thought to haue neere 10000 horse. He de∣manded,
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> as they say, 200000 Rixe Dollars, and two principall Townes (the very keyes of the country) of the Count of <HI>Emden,</HI> in satisfaction to the States, whose enemies hee had ayded. Whereupon the Count fled with his houshold furniture, towards the Bishop of <HI>Bremens</HI> country, and sent his two daugh∣ters to the towne of <HI>Embden</HI> to be there in more safetie.</P>
<P>It is confirmed, that the Count of <HI>Anholt,</HI> who hath beene the Bishop of <HI>Cullens</HI> Generall, hath had his towne of <HI>Anholt</HI> taken from him by Count <HI>Mansfield.</HI> The country comes in so fast to Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> that he cannot entertaine them all, but is faine to thanke and dismisse diuers.</P>
<P>The money which should pay those 16000, which the Colonel <HI>Kniphowsen</HI> is gone to leuie for the Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> in <HI>Bremenland, Wesphalia,</HI> and <HI>Brunswick,</HI> is made ouer to <HI>Embden</HI> by the States of the Vnited Prouinces; where it lyes ready for them.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Brunswick</HI> was conueyed vp towards Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> by the Count <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Nassaw</HI> his horse: which peraduenture were those 30 Cor∣nets, or some of them, which we in our last Newes told you of, that Count <HI>Henry</HI> had at <HI>Schencksconse.</HI></P>
<P>We haue here in <HI>London</HI> heard it againe repor∣ted, that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> and <HI>Henry Vandenberg</HI> haue had some bickering, wherein <HI>Mansfield</HI> had much the better: but for that we wonder, how that
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> should go on so quietly into <HI>Emb∣den-land,</HI> and why the Count should flie, if <HI>Henry Vandenberg</HI> were so neere; as also for that we haue heard no further of <HI>Henry Vandenbergs</HI> march that way, vnlesse it be he that is gone into the Duke of <HI>Holsteins</HI> country; we will not report this as a cer∣tainty, till we see better authoritie for it, in the Low Dutch relations.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>From the Hague the <HI>26</HI> of Nouemb. <HI>1622.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Newes here is, That the Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> is with his forces in the County of <HI>Embden,</HI> ransacking the country: And that the Bishop of <HI>Collen,</HI> and others, raise also forces to doe the like, meaning to reuenge themselues vpon the Duke of <HI>Holsteins</HI> country, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is also ready with 12000 men to march vpwards.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>From Duynkercke, the first of Nouember.</HEAD>
<P>Our valiant and famous Captaine <HI>Whitbok</HI> is here deceased the six and twentieth of <HI>Octob.,</HI> those that employed him haue lost much by his death, in the iudgement of the whole world: for he was a valiant and wary Captaine. Hee was buried with great state and pompe. <HI>Burgundy</HI> was drawne be∣hinde him, his Corpes were wrapped vp, in the ha∣bite of a Frier Predicant: the Hearse was followed by an hundred Muskettiers, who gaue him three vollies before the Church at his buriall. Hee hath left behinde him a Brother of his, who is likewise a very valiant Captaine.</P>
<P>Concerning the tyranny of the Reformed Bro∣thers (so the <HI>Dunkirkers</HI> here, call the <HI>Hollanders</HI> who professe the Reformed Religion) vpon those of Captaine <HI>Michael Iacobs</HI> Ship of <HI>Ostend,</HI> whom they fisht and gate out of the water, to hang them, it will breed ill bloud, for wee are aduised from <HI>Brussels,</HI> that the seuenty <HI>Rotterdammers</HI> and <HI>Em∣huyseners,</HI> which are here in prison, must cast Dice for their liues, to make vp two and twenty out of them all, to be hanged; which are iust so many as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> hanged of ours. And our Princesse the Archduchesse shewes her selfe very mercifull, seeing shee will haue but number for number put to death; and not all of these, which are here im∣prisoned.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nauie, seeing it is not arri∣ued here with the last good winde, we thinke that it is returned backe againe.</P>
