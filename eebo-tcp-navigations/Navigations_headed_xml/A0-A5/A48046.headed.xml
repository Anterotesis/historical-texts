<HEAD>A LETTER FROM AN OFFICER Belonging to the ORDNANCE On BOARD the FLEET Lying in the BAY before the ISLE of <HI>MAN,</HI> Giving an ACCOUNT of the Duke of <HI>Schom∣berg</HI>'s Arrival and Landing of the FORCES under his Command at <HI>Carrick Fergus</HI> IN IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P><HI>From the ISLE of</HI> MAN August 15th.</P>
<P>YEsterday seven Night, we arrived at the Camp that was formed near <HI>Highlake</HI> in Order to be Transported for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and last <HI>Saturday</HI> we shipt our Stores and Pro∣visions that we brought with us, as also two hundred and fifty draught Horses, belonging to our Train of Artillery; after which we went on Board our selves. On <HI>Monday</HI> mor∣ning very early the Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> our General, with Lieu∣tenant General <HI>Solmes,</HI> set Sail, having embarqued two days before, the Wind being fair at East, with four Frigats, and
<PB REF="2"/>about seventy or eighty Sail of other Ships, on board which there were about twelve hundred Land Souldiers for the Irish Expedition; having given Orders that the Vessels on which the Artillery, Provisions and Victuals were shipp'd, should make what haste they could after them under the Convoy of three Frigates, that were left to accompany us, and joyn him in this Bay; about eight of the Clock that morning, which was some hours after the General had been under sail, we set sail, and the Wind continuing fair, we came on <HI>Tuesday</HI> mor∣ning to an Anchor in this place, being about forty and four sail in all; it was no small surprise to us, that after we had safely, and with what haste we could come to the place of Rende∣vouz to find no tidings of our General, nor meet with any Orders from him, there being no body left to direct us what we should do, or what Course we should steer; however we were resolved to stay until we heard from his Grace, which we had the good luck to do this Morning by the <HI>Antelope</HI> Frigat, who sail'd out of <HI>Highlake</HI> with the General, and brought us Orders from his Excellency to sail with all possible speed from hence, and to come and joyn him in the <HI>Lough</HI> of <HI>Car∣rick Fergus,</HI> where the Captain said he had left him, landing the Forces in the Country on <HI>Antrim-side.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain tells us, that the General having fair wind did not think it needful to put in and come to Anchor in this Place being resolv'd to make the best of it, and proceed on his way, and farther tells us that the Town of <HI>Carrick Fergus</HI> was not all burnt down, but only some Fort, or Castle that was on a Rock that was blown up. Thus Major General <HI>Macarty</HI> was certainly wounded and taken Prisoner by the <HI>Inneskilling</HI> Men who had given a very great defeat to the Irish Army, as they were endeavouring to retire from the North, after the Relief of <HI>London Derry,</HI> and that it was credibly reported in those Parts, that there was hardly a Body of five hundred Irish together in all the North Counties of that Kingdom.</P>
