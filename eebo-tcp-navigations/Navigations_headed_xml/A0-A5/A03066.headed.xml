<HEAD>TRAVELS BEGUN Anno 1626. DE∣SCRIBING DIVERS parts of <HI>Africk,</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> the Great; but principally the two famous Monarchies, the <HI>Mogull</HI> and <HI>Persian.</HI> THE FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LL things are the more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indu∣ction.</NOTE> most things the better for Addition. In honour and wealth no fault is found with encrease; full meales &amp; full pleasures too; brim-full have no guard upon them. The fuller the better: If the husbandry bestowed up∣on this Book hath improv'd the soile, since you view'd it last, the Lyme was yours and charge of bringing; the spreading only belongs to mee as your day-labourer.</P>
<P>To improve on your incouragement, is for your credit, my delight; both our benefits. The gale you late so favourably lent me spred my affection, and againe lancht me into another Ocean. And,
<Q>Turpe mihi abire domo, vacuum{que} redire est.</Q></P>
<P>I know my new Relations must endure the touch; yea, and the handling too. So should all Books: But in this Age it fares with Books as with French toyes, faire to the eyes, well coverd with your empty Gallants, who take the people with the out-side bravery; Give me good Lynings.</P>
<P>My minde is like my habit, plaine; and my expressions (I hope so) too. If my new thoughts have added to your bottom, I know you will unwinde gent∣ly for feare of ravelling, and tie a knot where the thread breaks. But if I have made no Topographic mistakes, I feare no other deviations.</P>
<P>The first (the fruits of youth and haste) came abortive into your hands; and fail'd not of respective welcome. Yet in so cold, so nipping a Zone, more cloathing may be accepted of, and which I have woven with some toyle, but
<PB N="2" REF="7" MS="y"/>
very willingly, hoping it may discover more maturity. I formerly obeyed my friends, who thought the first too short; this then may prove the happier, since I have laboured to give them a ready acknowledgement. Let my errors therefore reflect on them, and impale me in your favour, for peradventure I may give boldnesse to your Factors, to fetch exotique rarities in a new divisi∣on of the world, and in assuring their Barques to bring you home, what may prove worthy your sight and mony. But this lucky gale will suffer no longer complement.</P>
<P>The relation of our Sea-voyage, is first enjoyned me.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1626.</NOTE>VPon Good-Friday, we took ship at <HI>Dover,</HI> having six great &amp; well-man'd ships along with us. In few houres coasting close by the Ile of <HI>Wight</HI> (call'd so from <HI>Gwydh</HI> a Brittish word signifying, seene at distance; <HI>Vectis</HI> in <HI>Pliny, Vecta</HI> in <HI>Eutropius;</HI>) where, a sudden and violent gust assaulted us; which, after an houres rage, spent it selfe, and blew us the third day (double solem∣niz'd by being the feasts of Mother and Sonne) upon the Lizards point or lands end of <HI>England,</HI> the utmost promontory of <HI>Cornwall;</HI> and from whence, to the extreamest cape of <HI>Afrique,</HI> wee compute our longitude, and not from the <HI>Azores</HI> the first Meridian.</P>
<P>The wind blew faire, so as the seven and twentieth day wee entred the Spa∣nish Ocean, the coast of <HI>Biscay</HI> neighbouring us. Ere long, we descried seven tall ships, whom reputing enemies, we bore up to speake with, but they pro∣ved friends, Hollanders out of the Levant, who drunk our healths as they past, by a roring Culverin; and we vomited out a like eccho of thunder, plow∣ing up the liquid Seas in merrinesse, till the nine and twentieth day made us the sport of Danger, dancing upon the raging billowes, <HI>Aeolus</HI> from his iron whistle blustering melancholly tunes, a good while heaven and sea seeming undivided. To which Tune <HI>Horace, Od.</HI> 3. <HI>lib.</HI> 1.</P>

</LG>
<P>Violence has no permanence; in thirty houres, the quarell 'twixt wind and sea was ended, and joy in a serene sky reanimated us, so as wee ended March in chase of a Turkish Pirat, whom with top-gallant top-sailes we pur∣sued 6 houres, but (to our griefe) he out-sailed us. The first of April we cut our passage into the vast <HI>Atlantick Ocean,</HI> by <HI>Arabs</HI> call'd <HI>Magribana,</HI> as saith <HI>Marmolius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Atlantic Ocean.</NOTE> (nam'd from <HI>Atlas Maurus,</HI> (brother to the star-gazer <HI>Prometheus</HI>) from whom two famous Mounts, one in <HI>Mauritania,</HI> th'other in <HI>Lybia,</HI> are de∣nominate.) Long we had not been in these seas, but another <HI>Barbarian</HI> Sally man of Warre came up to us, sculking all night in hope to board the first hee saw divided; at day break we found the villaine, who, loath to parlee in fire and shot, fled amaine and left us; who swum so well, that the third of April at <HI>Titans</HI> first blush we got sight of <HI>Porto Santo,</HI> a holy Port, (call'd <HI>Cerne</HI> in
<PB N="3" REF="7" MS="y"/>
<HI>Ptolomy</HI>) commanded by the superstitious Spaniard, and of <HI>Madaera</HI> (or Ile of Wood) from the <HI>Canaries</HI> 300 miles; the first, discovered by <HI>Perestrellus, anno</HI> 1419. 5398 undiscovered; given him upon condition he would people it, which he found difficult, the Conies in such numbers resisting and undermining him. The other the same yeere by <HI>Gonzalvo Zarco</HI> from incouragement of <HI>Henry,</HI> sonne to King <HI>Iohn</HI> the first, of <HI>Portugall.</HI> The holy Port has five and twenty miles compasse, notable in Wheat, Ry, Rice, Oxen, Sheep, Bores, Conies. <HI>Sanguis Draconûm,</HI> Fruits, Flowers, and Grapes, at 8 leagues distance thus re∣specting us.</P>

<P>And because we have <HI>nilnisi pontus et Aer</HI> to observe upon, let us theorize a little upon the Mathematiques. The Inhabitants within this Zone (the torrid) we are now in, are call'd <HI>Amphiscij,</HI> in respect they cast their shadowes both wayes according as the Sunne is in declination, and <HI>Ascij</HI> or shadowlesse, when <HI>Sol</HI>-is Zenith, from which point when it fleets either North or South the shadow ever darts contrarily, as falls out when ever the gnomon or coela∣ted body is interposed. The <HI>periscij</HI> have their shadow circulating, their meridionall shadowes having no existence from the vertice, but oblique and extended to the plaine of the terrestriall Horizon, glomerating the gnomon or body opacous; these sort of people freezing within the polar circles (of like distance from the pole, the Tropicks are from the Aequinoctiall) the pole being their vertex, and Aequator (90 degrees) their direct Horizon. The <HI>Hete∣roscij</HI> are such as live in the temperate Zone, whose shadowes at noone day turne but one way. And this the Mathematicks teach us, that the <HI>Heteroscij</HI> comprehend 41 parellells, the <HI>Amphiscij</HI> seven, the <HI>Periscij</HI> (those in the fro∣zen Zone) halfe the yeare. With these, goe others as they stand compara∣tively, the <HI>Periaeci, Antoeci, Antichthones.</HI> The first being such as dwell in two opposite points of a like circle, one from the other a semicircle or 180 de∣grees, so they be numbred after lesser parellells. The <HI>Antoeci</HI> are also opposite, but vary neither in Meridian nor aequidistance from the Horizon, respecting either Hemisphere.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antipodes</HI> are such as be feet to feet, a precise straight line passing tho∣row the Center from one side to another: differing frō the <HI>Periaeci</HI> by degrees of a smaller circle, whence we observe, that such as be to us <HI>Periaeci,</HI> be <HI>Antoeci</HI> to our <HI>Antichthones,</HI> each inverted to other in a perfect contrary. Nor doubt wee that there be, <HI>Antipodes,</HI> (the vaile of stupid ignorance being rent away) the <HI>sphericity</HI> of the world, and that every place in the earth (tho op∣posite) is habitable, now so well knowne as nothing seemes more familiar. Not∣withstanding, it was not so of old, when <HI>Boniface</HI> Bishop of <HI>Mentz</HI> (a Clerke well learned in that blockish age) was excommunicated by Pope <HI>Zachary, Anno</HI> 745. for maintaining such a paradox, yea was sentenc'd to be burnt for a heretick except hee had re canted: the holy Father bringing in Saint <HI>Augustin</HI> against it in his 16. book <HI>de civit.

<P>And from this Table, or from <HI>Herberts</HI> mount (a Piramid adjoyning, like the Sugar loafe, another hill so named) we see Cape <HI>Falso</HI> S. and by E. ten leagues; either of these great Promontories are divided by a Bay, but inconvenient to ride in: the distance of each Cape is 10 miles from North to South; either side environed with mountaines so lofty as seeme to penetrate the middle region with their aspiring foreheads, where they find sufficient moysture to coole their ambition: another river cal'd <HI>Iaquelina,</HI> streames upon the N. side of the roade, halfe a league from our Tents (under King <HI>Iames</HI> his mount we usually pitch them) broader than our <HI>rio dulce:</HI> but by a low course and too long sporting with the briny Ocean it tasts brackish and insalubrious; it is foordable without boate or Elephant, and gives variety of Shell-fish, as Tortoises, Limpits, Mussels, Cockels, Crabs, Rock-fish, and Mullets, Cra∣fish, Thornback, Gudgeon, Eeeles, &amp;c. The Earth abounds with roots, herbs and grasse aromatique, redolent and beneficiall: such as I took notice of, I may dare to name; Agrimony, Mynt, Calamint, Betony, Plantain, Ribwort, Spinage, Sorell, Scabious, Holy Thistle, and (of which beware) Coliquintida: all the yeer long, nature roabing the fruitfull earth with her choisest Tapistry, <HI>Flora</HI> seeming to dresse her selfe with artlesse Garlands; <HI>Alcinoe</HI> and <HI>Tempe</HI> serving as Emblems to this Elysium. <HI>Quamvis enim montosa appareat, &amp; col∣libus multis distincta, interim tamen multis vallibus, silvis, pratisque decorata est, gramina &amp; flores suavissimè olentes, magna copia producit.

<P>The Mountaines, without doubt, abound with Marquisate and all rich Mi∣neralls, which for want of search are yet undilucidated: the chiefe refresh∣ment we get here is water, bunch-backt Buffolos and Sheep, not of <HI>Iasons</HI> race; these in leiw of wooll, have haire parti-coloured, long leg'd, leane bo∣died, not caus'd by want of pasture, rather from too high feeding, or from restlesse moving with their tripping Masters. But, the land exuberates in many other Animalls. Lyons, (which usually steale Beefe out of the water when Ships are here, fire or a lighted match only scaring thē) Dromidaries, Antilopes, Apes, Baboons, (venerious ones) Zebrae, Wolves, Foxes, Iackalls, Doggs, Cats, and others; and in birds, as Estriches, Vultures, Cranes, and Passe flemingoes, whose feathers (equallizing the birds of Paradise) are rich crimson and pure white so amiably commixed, that above others it inticed my pains to present it you, which shall terminate our curiosity touching the earth, &amp; commence an Anatomy lecture of the most savage (of all savage) inhabitants.</P>

<P>The Cape of <HI>good Hope</HI> elevates the Antartick-Pole foure and thirty de∣grees 3 minutes; has longitude from the Meridian of the Lyzard 28 degrees, and Westerly variation, one degree, and about forty minutes: distant from <HI>England</HI> about 6600 miles English; (or 2200 leagues, which at Sea we usually reckon by) from Saint <HI>Helena S.E.</HI> 600 leagues; from <HI>Iava major</HI> 1850 leagues; from <HI>Surat</HI> 1800.

his losse of 1200000 men imploy'd to make the red and mid-land Sea as one) incouraged the Phoenicians (then, proud of their Art in Navigation) to sur∣round <HI>Afrique,</HI> which to please him but more for glory, they undertook, and in three yeares effected. But sure, so excellent an adventure (if it had beene so) could not have escaped the busie pens of the Aegyptians and Greeks, who for want of true matter, invented a thousand Fables. The first threfore we can ho∣nour (as sayes <HI>Osorius</HI>) is, <HI>Vasco de Gama</HI> or <HI>Bartolo de Dios, Lusitanians, anno</HI> 1497. from <HI>Adam</HI> 5467. by importunity of that excellent Prince, <HI>Iohn</HI> 2. coast∣ing hither and so into the Orient.</P>
<P>The Country is rich and fruitfull in her womb, but owned by an accursed Progeny of <HI>Cham,</HI> who differ in nothing from bruit beasts save forme; a peo∣ple by some call'd (metonimically) <HI>Caffarrs</HI> or Atheists; Anarchy confounds order, no Prince of power or policie awing them: each Canton commanded by a Captaine, not chosen by voice but as force urges it. Captain <HI>Fitz-Her∣bert</HI> some yeares since ceremoniously devoted the Title to our King, in a me∣moriall new naming two little rising Mounts 'twixt the Sea and Sugar loafe, King <HI>Iames</HI> and Prince <HI>Charles</HI> their Mounts, (our now dread Soveraigne;) Give we an exact <HI>Idaea</HI> of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The People described.</NOTE>Their colour is ugly black, are strongly limbd, desperate, crafty, and inju∣rious. Their heads are long; their haire, woolly and crispt, no apparell in any place shewing more variety. Some shave one side and leave the other long and curled. Another cuts all away, a little tuft atop, excepted; a third (think∣ing his invention best) shaves here and there, the bald scull appearing in many places; and othersome, (not unlike Occasion) shave away all save a lock be∣fore, of no use, save ornament. Such as have tufts, or haire, plait brasse but∣tons, spurre-rowells, pieces of pewter, or what else the mirthfull Sayler ex∣change for Beefe, Mutton, Woodsorrell, Oestrich egge-shells, little Tor∣toises, &amp;c. their eares are long, made longer by ponderous Bables they hang there, some using links of brasse, of iron, others have glasse-beads, chains, blew stones, bullets, or Oyster-shells. And such as cannot reach to such jewells (rather than be without) have singles of Deare, beaks of birds, Doggs or Cats stones, Egg-shells, or the like: their noses are flat, crusht so in their infancie; great lips, description cannot make them greater; quick crafty eyes; and about their necks (in imitation of the Dutch <HI>Commandores</HI> chaines) have guts and raw-puddings, serving both for food and complement, eating and speaking both together. Yet of late they have got hoopes of iron, and long links of brasse, grasse wreathes, or greasie thongs of stinking leather. Their armes are loaden with voluntary shackles of iron, Jvory, rusty brasse, or musty copper. The rest of their bodies are naked, save that a thong or girdle of raw leather circles them, a square peece (like the back of a Glove) is fastned to it, serving to cover their <HI>pudenda.</HI> But I cannot commend their modesty, the women (upon receipt of any thing) returning her gratitude by discovering her shame, a curtesie taught them by some ill-bred Boore, our men I hope have more civility. The grand Seigniors among them have better cloathing; a nasty un∣tand hide or skin of a Lyon, Leopard, Calfe, Baboon, or Sheep (the haire in∣verted) is as a roabe put about their shoulders reaching to their waste, thighes and legges never covered, their feet fastned to a broad peece of leather, tied by a little strap, resembling the Roman <HI>crepidula,</HI> not alwayes worne; their

hands for the most part hold them, not that they feare to weare them out, but that their feet may have their liberty to steale, which with their toes they can doe most daintily, all the while looking you in the face as if they knew not how to deceive any. Most of the men are Semi-Eunuchs, one stone ever be∣ing tane away by the Nurse, either to dististinguish them from ordinary men, or that Mistresse <HI>Venus</HI> allure them not from <HI>Pallas.</HI> The women also excise themselves, not from a Notion of religion but as an ornament: Both sex, hi∣deously cut, and gash, and pink in sundry works, their browes, nose, cheeks, armes, brest, back, belly, thighes and legges in <HI>Acherontick</HI> order: in a word, are so deformed, that if they had studied to become antick, they might be praised for invention.</P>
<P><HI>Antrae lares, dumeta thoros, caenacula rupes;</HI> They have no houses, Caves and holes they delight to dwell in, or Lyons dennes, unfurnished, but per∣fum'd I warrant you, a whole Tribe commonly keeping together, equally vil∣lanous, coupling without distinction, the name of wife or brother unknowne among these incestuous Troglodites: feeding, sleeping, speaking all together without order or law; in the night sleeping round a fire, a Centinell regarding the Lyons their adversaries, 'twixt whom is such hate and stratagems, <HI>Vivitur ex rapto</HI> that one eat other, the Lyon suddenly tearing some of them, and they other times trayning the Lyons over cover'd pits, which catches them, and so retaliating; slaying and eating them to day, who perhaps were Sepulchres to their friends or parents the day before. Other times they dawb and rub their skinne with grease and coale, and so indent it, drying them in the Sunne, by that trick becomming Monsters to all civill eyes that look them upon.</P>
<P>By what I have said, you may imagine their pallats are not very delicate. <HI>Solinus</HI> calls the tawny <HI>Africans, Agriophagi</HI> (or Panther and Lyon-eaters) we now call them <HI>Icthio</HI> and <HI>Anthropophagi,</HI> a degree more barbarous than the Lyons, of whom 'tis said, <HI>Mortuorum cadavera non gustant; quod vivit, corri∣piunt et ex comedunt.</HI> But these Savages eat men alive or dead, as in both kinds many poore men have lamentably made experience of. Which whē they faile of, dead Whales, Seales, Pengwins, grease or raw Puddings diet them. Safety is scarce among themselves, for when the frost of old age benums their vigour, unapting them to provide their owne food, they either eat them, or leave them destitute of defence upon some Mountain, pittied by none, where famine kills them, or the ravening Lions.</P>

<P>To draw to an end, (lest <HI>Mindus</HI> gates be opened) many beasts we got here for refreshment, such and the good sallads and baths quickly recuring above 300 of our men (till their landing) nigh dead of the scurvie. <HI>Anno</HI> 1600 Sir <HI>Iames Lancaster</HI> had 1000 Sheep and 50 Oxen for Trifles. Wee had no want, and might have had more but for a trick the Hollanders put upon our Nation; riding here with our Colours out, and killing some of the people when they had got their ends, that at our arrivall wee might be the baselier used; they traine their cattell to such obedience, as with a Call or Whistle (impossible to be counterfeited) a great Heard will follow them like dogges, and being sold, with a like Call will as readily runne after them, to the purchasers costly mirth and admiration; a deceit so long so unjustly acted, that now (to prevent them) our men upon delivery of each beast, either kill it quickly, or fasten their hornes with cords to stakes plac'd here of purpose: and to say truly, by the friendship and good dealing our men use to them <HI>(Nomen amicitiae barbara cor∣da movet)</HI> our esteeme among them is more gratious than of Portugall, Dane, or Flemmin.</P>
<P>Their Art in Warre is guided by disorder, their weapon no other than a Javelin headed with iron, and directed by some feathers, which they take off and on at pleasure; some quarrels happend (by some mens indiscretion) twixt us and them, and I know a dozen Musquets will chase 1000, at every discharge falling downe as thunder-struck. Yet let me advise our Men to avoid need∣lesse bravadoes, and not contemne them from their indefensive nakednesse, or by a supercilious conceit of their owne weapons and field practises. <HI>Exem∣pla docent.

The three and twentieth of <HI>Iuly</HI> the wind got up, inraging the restlesse Ocean; one surging wave (I well remember) striking us so pat upon our broad side, as forced our Ship in despight of her helme (then close by the Lee) to turne about above 5 points in the compasse, the noyse not inferiour to a Cannon; insomuch, our Captaine cryed out we had struck upon a rock, but his error quickly appea∣red (after so great a thunder) the wave flashing upon our decks so much salt water as soundly washt us all; the storme continuing till the eight and twen∣tieth day, when veering into a milder quarter (our course E.

<P>Of fruits we will select but three, such as may merit our acceptance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plan∣tain fruit.</NOTE>The Plantaine (for taste and odour second to none in <HI>Mohelia</HI>) is a fruit so good and vailed with so broad a leafe that <HI>Goropius</HI> (if he be worht be∣leeving) perswades us, <HI>Adam</HI> offended in eating it, and with these leaves made his transgression manifest; and that also, which was brought <HI>Moses</HI> out of the Holy Land: by the Arabians it is called <HI>Musa-mawm, Pican</HI> by the In∣dians: they hang in great clusters, their shape is long and round, not unlike a Soffage; the rind peels off, the fruit is gold-yellow, relisht like a Windsor Peare; good for urine, but bad for fluxes, cold crude stomacks, and dis∣senteries.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="20" MS="y"/>The Coco (an excellent fruit) is cover'd with a thick rynd; both together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coco.</NOTE> equall in bignesse to a Cabbage: the shell is like the skull of man, or rather a Deaths head; eyes, nose and mouth, being easily discerned; <HI>intus vita!</HI> with∣in, we find better than the out-side promised; a quart of Ambrosie, coloured like new white Wine, but farre more aromatick tasted; the meat or kernell cleaves to the shell, and is not easily parted; above an inch thick, better relisht than our Philberts, and enough to satiate the appetite of two reasonable men. It has other excellencies, The Tree (which is straight and lofty, not branch∣ing save at the very top, where it spreads in beautifying plumes, the Nuts like pendants or pearles adorning them) is good for timber, or Canooes, Masts, Anchors: the leaves for Tents or thatching; the rynd for Sailes, Mattresses, Cables and Linnen; the shell for furniture; the meat for victualling: rare blessings!

<P>The Toddy Tree is not unlike the Date or Palmeto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Toddy.</NOTE> the Wine is got by pearcing and putting a Iar or Pitcher under, that the liquor may distill into it, at the very top it has a pith or marrow, which being boyl'd is like a Colli-flower, but the taking that part is as if another Tree should be eradicated, the soule therein consisting; these (as the Dates) thrive not nor fructifie, except the flowring male and female be united. The Toddy is like Whay in colour, in taste and quality like Rhenish wine, at first draught uncouthly relisht, but every draught tasts better and better, and will easily inebriate; a little makes men merry; too much makes them mad; extreame is mortall: in the mor∣ning tis laxative; in the eve costive; at midnight dangerous. Of this or the Coco, <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> write thus: <HI>Ex quibus, panem, mel, vinum, acetum &amp; vestitum conficiunt.</HI> To end, these are bought without much charges; thirty Orenges or Lemons for a sheet of paper: for two sheets tenne Coco Nuts: an Ox for a ryall of eight: a Goat for six pence. They have no Ships, nor Boats, save such as are hewed out of one stump or tree, capable to receive three Fishermen in faire weather; and if they sink, their swimming helps them: but though of no use with us, yet for rarity sake I give thee the shape better to be imagined.</P>

<P>The Inhabitants are true black, the Sunne twice every yeare darting his fiery rayes perpendicular amongst them; by profession they are Christians; converted the third yeare after our Saviours passion, by the Aethiopian Eu∣nuch some say; some say by St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle of the <HI>Orient:</HI> their Chur∣ches are built in forme of the Crosse, like ours: kept sweet and neat, without seats and images: they have a Patriarch, whom they reverence; and other of the Clergy to whom they duly pay Tythes; their Feasts and Fasts like ours; the seniority are much regarded, humility commanded and commended; se∣cond Marriages are not allowed, except they had no children, use the crosse in Baptisme, the other Sacrament in both kinds, and being dead, lament not, but involve them in cleane linnen, and so bury them that they looke towards Jerusalem.</P>
<P><HI>Aden</HI> (now, so neere us) seemes to invite a small relation; It has 12 degrees 35 min. North, var. West. 19 degrees: <HI>Madaena</HI> of old, <HI>Adana</HI> in <HI>Calistus, Adedi</HI> and <HI>Achanis</HI> in <HI>Eupolemus:</HI> opposed to <HI>Azana,</HI> in the Arabian shoare, but snatcht <HI>anno</HI> 1458. from the Arabs by the Turks, a ragged obscure sort of Lo∣custs till then, then swarming and mounting towards <HI>Trepizond.</HI></P>
<P>The road or Bay is none of the safest, in the change flowing eight foot wa∣ter; a S.E. and N.W. Moone makes a full sea there; from <HI>Bab-mandel</HI> 18 leagues; from <HI>Moha</HI> (old <HI>Beronice</HI> or <HI>Moco</HI> rather, a Towne in <HI>Arabia Petrea</HI> after <HI>Ptol.</HI>) two and thirty. <HI>Aden</HI> is seated low, sulphuriously shaded by a high barren Mountaine; whose brazen front scorching the miserable Towne, yeelds a perfect character of <HI>Turkish</HI> basenesse. It is a Peninsule, and a good way (to get breath) thrusts it selfe into the blushing Sea; big in circuit, but has not many houses, nor those curious; their outsides discovering a discontented slavery, the inside shewes poverty and wretchednesse. A Castle it has set neer the sea, not to be entred but by a long narrow dissected path or trench; the Castle is very strong and lofty, strengthned by so many rampiers and bulwarks, stored with so many roring Cannons, as if <HI>Mars</HI> dwelt there, or that it kept a Mammon of treasure, having in truth nothing but iron bullets, armour, and miserable raggamuffians to defend it: the red Sea (on whose bancks 'tis sea∣ted) borrowes not the name from colour, rather from sand, which on the shoare and from the bottome has (when <HI>Apollo</HI> visits the <HI>Antipodes</HI>) a ruddy reflection: shall I tell you the severall names it has; some say 'tis called red, from <HI>Erethreus</HI> sonne of <HI>Perseus</HI> and <HI>Andromida,</HI> a Prince (in the worlds ado∣lescency) much regarded, from whose name (as the <HI>Aegean</HI> and <HI>Icarian</HI>) the

<P>October 18 we had the wind pretty faire. Our observation that day being 17 degrees, our longitude 19 from <HI>Mohelia;</HI> the wind less'ned, and weather grew flaming hot; no Stove or Sudatory exceeding it: it made us very faint, yet having past through as bad, it seemed lesse torment to us. But <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Persian Merchant (whose father <HI>Hodgee Suare</HI> died in London the yeare before) could hold out no longer, a Feaver drawing him through the path of death;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahomet converted.</NOTE> a happy man, if (throwing away the raggs of Mawmetry) hee roab'd his soule with true faith in Christ; they say he call'd upon him, twice happy man, if unfaignedly: At his putting into the Sea, the Captain honour'd his fu∣neral with the sky rending clamour of foure Culverin shot, leaving his carcasse to the mercy of the Sea and Fish, a sure treasurie till the resurrection.</P>
<P>The six and twentieth of <HI>October</HI> we found we were got North from the Aequinoctiall 19 degrees 40 minutes and longitude from <HI>Mohelia</HI> 20 degrees, our stearage at that time South East, the Sea pacifique, the wind moderate, but heat offensive: where also we had such shoales of flying fishies as dark∣ned the glorious Sunne by their interposing multitude; a fish most excellent

<P>The seventeenth of November, to our comfort we descried (<HI>terra ter ex optata</HI>) the coast of <HI>India;</HI> in fifteene degrees latitude, and 32 of longitude (the ill weather having driven us to Lee-ward many leagues) that very place where <HI>Goa</HI> (<HI>Barigaza</HI> of old) is seated; the bravest, best defended Citie in the Orient; the Magazeen, refuge, seat of Justice, of the insolent and gold-thirsty Portugall. The Citie is not visible to such as Navigate in the Ocean, being built three houres journey within the land, in <HI>Tilsoare,</HI> an Ile of 30 miles cir∣cuit, surrounded by a river streaming from the mighty mountaine <HI>Bellaguate. Goa,</HI> is compast with a strong and beautifull wall, proud in her aspiring Tur∣rets, dreadfull in many sorts of tormenting Cannons: her strength and beauty begun from the Decan Emperours, <HI>Zabaym</HI> and <HI>Idalcan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goa.</NOTE> from whom <HI>anno</HI> 1509 <HI>Albuquerque</HI> conquer'd it, but agrandiz'd from the Lusitanian; the great Buzzar (or Market) is in center of the Towne, richly built, pleasant and ca∣pacious. The other streets are (after the Indian mode) narrow and nasty; the buildings in generall, are spatious and comly; dark within, tarrassed and sutable to the seasons: 'tis watered with a delicious streame, which (by bene∣volence of the ayre) refreshes the fields, forcing <HI>Flora</HI> to dismantle; the gar∣dens be also fill'd with variety of sweet and eye-pleasing flowers: the whole Ile abounds with grasse, corne, groves, cattell, fruits, and such sence ravishing delights a reasonable man can require: above 20 little Townes are seene in this 30 miles compasse. In <HI>Goa</HI> is nothing more observable than the fortifica∣tions, the Viceroy and Archbishops Pallaces, and the Churches: Field peeces here are numbred above 300; the Pallaces are strong, of good stone, furnisht within with rich Arras and painting: the Churches of best rank are, that de∣dicated to the blessed Virgin Mother of God, (in which, is kept the bones and skull of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle, holy Reliques brought 50 yeares agoe from <HI>Meliapore</HI> by <HI>Emanuel Frias</HI> at command of <HI>Iohn,</HI> successour to <HI>Emanuel,</HI> Kings of Portugall.) St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> St. <HI>Dominie,</HI> St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> St. <HI>Savior,</HI> and others; in which, are prest downe the bones of restlesse <HI>Albuquerque,</HI> buried in the yeare 1516; of <HI>d' Acugnia,</HI> of <HI>Don Francisco,</HI> and that late canonized <HI>Chyna</HI> St. <HI>Fran∣cis Shyvier</HI> the Navarrean Jesuit, who died <HI>anno</HI> 1552. 4 <HI>December,</HI> aged 55, and rubricated by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> 15. 12 <HI>March</HI> 1622, when many more were Sainted.</P>
<P>We hasted hence towards <HI>Swally,</HI> judging the worst past, the Indian shoare all our way in view us, and the sea every where 20 leagues from land an∣chorable: But, sure all peace comes from above, and mans heart abounds with vanity; for upon a sudden, the element grew dreadfull, the wind to rore, the sea sublime and wrathfull, for three dayes space raging incessantly with such
<PB N="34" REF="23" MS="y"/>
fury, that we verily beleeved a Tuffon or Herocane was begun, a Tempest of 30 dayes continuance, so terrible that houses and trees are like dust afore it, many great ships having beene blowne a shoare and shattered; once in nine yeares it uses to thunder among them, presag'd by birds, and beasts who three or foure dayes before it bluster, cry out and runne under ground for shelter, as if an overture of all the world were ensuing: But praised be God wee were deceived, we mist a Tuffon, but not a second disadventure, this storme forcing a Mallabar Junck, a Pirat in view of us; our Ordnance could not reach them, though the longest Saker we had vomited the fire of defiance at them, where∣by we were forced (in way of honour) to chase her with Barges mann'd with fifty Musquetiers: But, <HI>Vela damus, quamvis remige Navis eat.</HI> We made too much haste in boarding her, being entertain'd with such store of Fire-works and Granados, a volley of cruell shafts; in a word, we were opposed with so much desperate courage that after small hurt to them, wee retreated with shame, the better halfe slaine, hurt, and scalded, our ships all the while being made an unwilling Theater of this Affront, the wind forbidding them to retaliate.</P>
<P>The 22 of <HI>November</HI> the wind abated, and wee found ground at forty fa∣domes, many Snakes swimming about our ships, which (with the waters chan∣ging colour) assured us we were neere the shoare (the last storme had puzled us) and soone after we discerned land in 19 degrees 35 minutes latitude, and 29 in longitude, which by its towring height we knew to be <HI>Dabul,</HI> and then St. <HI>Iohn de vacas,</HI> a Towne subject to the Portugall, at the South end especi∣ally mounting in an ambitious piramid of Natures work, named <HI>Saint Valen∣tin's peake,</HI> the land continuing high from thence to <HI>Gundavee,</HI> a hill six leagues short of <HI>Swalley</HI> road, a round hillock and bay of importance unto Mariners.</P>

<P>The seven and twentieth day of <HI>November,</HI> we hal'd an <HI>Indian</HI> piscadoro abord us, never was Antick better habited; he told us of many enemies, but we were fearelesse; after long toyle tiding up with streame anchors, every sixt houre weighing and dropping, in short time we got to <HI>Choul,</HI> and then against <HI>Daman,</HI> a lovely towne lorded by the <HI>Portugalls,</HI> and conspicuous to passengers; at the North end it has a Castle large, strong and daring; the materiall is good white chalky stone, flanckt with Ordnance and mounted high to play at advantage; At the South end we perceived a faire Church, with white battlements a top, the houses of like stone, strong and beautifull, 3 other Temples affoording joy and pleasure to the heart and eye. The nine and twentieth day we got neere the barre at <HI>Swalley,</HI> and there cast Anchor, because wee perceiv'd 13 saile of great ships, and knew not whether they were friends or enemies: the last day of <HI>November</HI> we adventured over the Barre, 'twixt two boas, in 4 fadome water, a hundred paces asunder, set there to manifest the passage, either side without being very dangerous: the Ships
<PB N="35" REF="23" MS="y"/>
at Anchor proved our friends, 6 <HI>English,</HI> and 7 <HI>Dutch,</HI> the most of them 1000 Tunne: those of our Nation were good men of Warre. The <HI>Palsgrave, Ex∣change,</HI> the <HI>William,</HI> the <HI>Blessing,</HI> &amp;c. each of which (to do them right) feasted our Lord Ambassadors with hearty welcome: we rode in 5 fadome (others in 9) twixt the sholds and continent.</P>
<P>The same day we came to an Anchor in <HI>Swalley</HI> roade, <HI>Nogdi-Ally-beg</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> Ambassador (Sir <HI>Robert Sherley's</HI> Antagonist) dyed; having desperate∣ly poisoned himselfe; for 4 dayes, eating only <HI>Ophium:</HI> the <HI>Mary</HI> (where he dyed) gave him eleven great Ordnance, whose thundring Ecchoes solem∣niz'd his carrying ashoare: his sonne <HI>Ebrahim-chan</HI> got him conveighed to <HI>Surrat</HI> (10 miles thence) where they intombed him, not a stones cast from <HI>Tom Coryats</HI> grave, knowne but by two poore stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. Cory∣ats grave.</NOTE> there resting till the resurrection.</P>
<P>Doubtlesse, <HI>Nogdibeg</HI> had a guilty conscience, hee had very basely mis∣behav'd himselfe in <HI>England,</HI> and feared the extreame rigour of <HI>Abbas</HI> a just (but too severe) Master, at no time to bee jested with in money matters or reputation; so as neither his past good service, alliance at Court, skill in armes, nor brave aspect, could animate his defence, assured of most horrid torture: Other mens sufferings upon lesse cause made his seeme more unpar∣donable: in the yeere 1612. a <HI>Persian</HI> Ambassador at <HI>Constantinople</HI> (for assen∣ting to such Articles 'twixt his Master and the Grand <HI>Seignior,</HI> as seem'd ad∣vantagious to him, but odious to the <HI>Persian</HI> Monarck) was upon his returne, beheaded at <HI>Cazbyn</HI> by command of his inraged Master: the conditions were indeed dishonourable, That the Prince of <HI>Persia</HI> should arrogate no other Title but Bashaw of <HI>Tauris:</HI> that the <HI>Persian</HI> should pay tribute for <HI>Gheylan,</HI> yeerly 400 bal's of silk: that the <HI>Cadi</HI> of <HI>Tauris</HI> should bee of the <HI>Turkes</HI> Election, &amp;c. which <HI>Abbas</HI> kickt back to <HI>Achmat</HI> with great indignation. <HI>Tamas∣coolibeg</HI> also came into his mind, who dyed miserably (tho once second in <HI>Persia</HI>) upon spleene ill grounded by the King; and of <HI>Turkish</HI> barbarisme, not a few exemplaries. <HI>Ebrahim Bassa, Cycala, Synon Bassa</HI> and <HI>Nassuf,</HI> each of them in their times sitting at the Sterne, guiding as they listed the <HI>Turkish</HI> greatnesse, yet ere death cald for them, they were cald for, by precipitating ends, such as made the remembrance of their passed glory, relish the sowrer &amp; more deformed: and <HI>Nogdibeg,</HI> (as we heard the King protest) if he had not prevented it, should first have beene hackt in peeces, and then in the open market place burnt with dogs turds, a perfume not fetcht from <HI>Arabia,</HI> a staine indeleble, branding with shame all his posterity. Returne we to the roade againe.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="24"/>
we had tidings of <HI>Sultan Curroon's</HI> Coronation at <HI>Agra, Anno</HI> 1627. whose history we will prosecute, after we have view'd the Towne, which may well challenge a particular description.</P>
<P>SVRRAT, (perhaps so cald by the <HI>Surae,</HI> whom <HI>Pliny</HI> places here,) is that old <HI>Muziris</HI> named by <HI>Ptol.</HI> if my judgement deceive me not: nor am I ig∣norant, <HI>Choul</HI> and <HI>Onor</HI> are imagin'd it by <HI>Molelius</HI> and <HI>Ramusius;</HI> a Town at this day great, famous, rich, &amp; populous: nor ayre nor soyle agree with strangers; the one inflamed by the torridnesse of the Zone, the other sandy and sulphu∣reous; the Artick Pole is here elevated one and twenty degrees, three min. subject in <HI>Iune</HI> to become <HI>Nadyr</HI> to the burning Sunne, thence to <HI>September</HI> the clouds showring continually an insalubrious moysture, the wind and thunder so commixing, that no place in the world seemes more unhealthy, all the other 8 moneths either parching or freezing. <HI>Surat</HI> is accounted the third best Towne in the <HI>Gujurat</HI> Kingdome, <HI>Amadavad</HI> &amp; <HI>Cambaya</HI> excelling her; from the first removed foure from the other two good dayes journey, all now adding lustre to the <HI>Moguls</HI> rich replendent Diadem. Whether <HI>Gusurat</HI> comply with the Greekidiom <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or from <HI>Gezurat</HI> in <HI>Arabick</HI> an Ile, I question not; a Province it is so usefull to the <HI>Mogull,</HI> that his annuall tribute out of this one shire amounts (as Marchants say) to 150 Tunne of gold. <HI>Su∣rat</HI> is at this day not very strong, neither in scite nor Ordnance; a 100. yeere agoe <HI>Antonio Siverio</HI> a <HI>Portuguise</HI> with 200 men enter'd it, sackt and burnt it; a 1000 would now find it a hard enterprise. It was after that subjected to <HI>Ecbar Anno Dom.</HI> 1566. of the <HI>Hegira</HI> 946. by valour of <HI>Chan Azem,</HI> whose care defeated the confederacy of <HI>Mirza-chan, Hussan, Mirza Mahomet, Chan Goga</HI> and other conspirators. <HI>Surat</HI> is now in a quiet government, watered with a sweet river named <HI>Tappee</HI> (or <HI>Tindy</HI>) as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Windsor</HI> which arising out of the <HI>Decan</HI> Mountaines, glides thorow <HI>Brampore</HI> (220 miles distant thence) and in many <HI>Maeanders</HI> runnes by <HI>Surat,</HI> and after 20 miles playing to and fro, a league from <HI>Swalley</HI> road wanders into the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean. 'Tis circled with a mud-wall, a Castle of stone is strongly built at the South-West side, the river washing it; planted with great Ordnance and other shot; awed by a Garrison, who make dainty to admit a stranger to see their fortifi∣cations or parapets; The West opens into the <HI>Buzzar</HI> thorow a faire gate of stone, where toll-gatherers are ever ready to search and exact sound tribute for the great <HI>Mogull</HI> their Master: the <HI>Medon</HI> is of no great beauty, nor do the shops give splendor; the crafty <HI>Banuyan</HI> desiring rather to be rich indeed then so accounted. The houses are indifferently beautifull; some are of carv'd wood, others of bricks dryed in the Sunne, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> houses at the North end excelling the other for space and furniture; the Suburbs also have 3 posterns, pointing out 3 severall wayes; one to <HI>Variaw</HI> and to <HI>Cambaya;</HI> a second to <HI>Brampore;</HI> the third to <HI>Nansary</HI> ten course thence, whence the road is to <HI>Gundavee,</HI> to <HI>Balsac,</HI> and to <HI>Daman</HI> upon the Ocean. The Towne affoords no Monuments, no Mosques worth the taking notice of: the <HI>English</HI> garden without the Towne has pretty walks, sweet flowers and a water-worke, but scarce commendable: Only adjoyning <HI>Nancery</HI> gate, I saw a Tanck or Magazen of water, a brave work and worthy the noting: It is of good free stone, circling in above 100 sides and angles; eight and twenty Ells twixt every angle, in compasse very neere a thousand paces. It diminishes

its largnesse gradatim by 16 degrees or steps towards the bottome, of most use to receive a great quantity of raine water, to quench the flagrant thirst of the Sunne-burnt <HI>Indians:</HI> the river by this, seemes somewhat unwholsome, if good neither for drink nor navigation, what serves it for, save to mundifie the idolatrous <HI>Banuyan</HI> and superstitious <HI>Mahometans:</HI> the <HI>Bannyans</HI> are the grea∣ter number here, but the <HI>Moores</HI> command them: they have a native lan∣guage of their owne, but the <HI>Persian</HI> tongue is understood by most, and is most courtly. The <HI>Indian</HI> Mahometans, are a crafty, cowardly sort of peo∣ple, (most of the great men being either <HI>Rashbootes</HI> or <HI>Persians</HI>) yet love to go arm'd all day with sword and buckler, bow, arrowes, and daggers, as if they stood in danger of some enemies: their habit is a quilted coat of Calico, tyed under the left arme, a small shash upon their head, large stockings and some∣times sandalls: in an ordinary garbe are thus resembled.</P>

<P>The <HI>Bannyans</HI> (or <HI>Vanyans</HI>) are tawny of complexion, faire spoken, crafty, and above measure superstitious; they let their haire grow long, their head is covered with a small wreath or shash for the most part white; their habit, a long coat or vest of white quilted Callico of the Dalmatick sort; their shooes are variable in colour and fashion; some checkerd and ingraled in ele∣gant order, wrought to each mans ingenious fancy; with out latchets, sharp and turning up at the toe, thin sol'd, high heeld, surrounded with steele, fast and durable: The women are whiter than the men, yet want the san∣guine mixture to adorne them, which they supply by Art, there being found the best vermilion: they weare their haire long and disheveled; part obscu∣red by a fine thin Lawne, by whose transparency it seemes more lovely; their eares, noses, armes, and legs, are loaden with many voluntary rings and fetters of Brasse, Gold and Ivory; their behaviour is silently modest, but full gorg'd with libidinous fantasies and distempers. Marriage is so honored, that they contract at 7 commonly, and at 10 yeeres old are often parents: but if an infant die ere he be married, the parents of him that dyed procure some virgin or other (to whom they give some <HI>Dynaes</HI> of Gold in lieu of Ioyn∣cture) to be his bed-fellow one night, to avoid the reproachfull proverb, <HI>he dyed unmarried.</HI></P>

<P>Poligamy is odious among them, in which respect they cease not to villi∣fie <HI>Mahomitans</HI> as people of an impure soule, and stuft with turpitude; yea, in this they paralell the Antick <HI>Romans,</HI> who (as <HI>Tacitus, Marcellin,</HI> and <HI>Ter∣tullian</HI> tell us) so hated Digamy (both in enjoying two wives at one time, and being twice married) as no Holocaust was ever offred, no holy fire lookt unto by such, nor such as issued from such parents. Their Funeralls are of the old stamp (recorded by <HI>Curtius</HI>) sacring the corps to ashes in a holy fire, compounded of all sorts of costly woods and Aromatick spices: the wife also (in expectation to enjoy her husband 'mongst incomparable pleasures) inve∣lops her dainty body with the mercilesse flames, for which kindnesse she ob∣taines a living memory. Their Priests are called <HI>Bramyni</HI> or <HI>Brachmani;</HI> such as in old times from their quality, were nam'd <HI>Gymno-sophi,</HI> as <HI>Porphirius</HI> the great Platonist in his 4. <HI>lib. de abstinen. ab esu carnium,</HI> dictates concerning them, and thus: If by descent he continued constant to his study and con∣templation, he then attained great Aestimation, and the title <HI>Brachman:</HI>

Their imaginatiō flew beyond nature, beleiving that this Fabrick of the inferiour world was created of nothing, and made sphericall, yet subject to dissolution; that it had an efficient cause, it being unable to forme it selfe, and that that cause is the commander of nature. Our byrth to be no other, then a quick conception, perfected by death, which is the true Nativity of the soule, and entrance to immortality. A Tenent however oppugned by the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> yet by these <HI>Bramyns</HI> from the Tradition of the <HI>Phenix,</HI> observation of corne, and the like, was so maintained that from hence arose that magnanimity of <HI>Calanus</HI> the <HI>Bramyn,</HI> who to injoy it burnt himselfe in sight of <HI>Alexander.</HI> But, how they have (by over∣ture of their wits and country,) forgot these and broacht new opinions, more fantastick and rediculous. I shall gleane a little out of that their masse of confusion, and dedicate it to your attent patience.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of the Banny∣ans.</NOTE>The <HI>Bannyan</HI> religion at this day, is of these Tenents. That the whole frame or body of the world had a beginning, created by a God of immense power, eternall and provident: that after he had made man, to associate him created woman to simpathize in similitude of body, and disposition. These be named <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parcouty,</HI> a coople so innnocent, and contented, that they had no ill thoughts, but fed only upon herbs and fruits, not touch∣ing ought had bloud or life in it. From this chast couple sprung two couple of boyes, the Embleams of the foure complexions, <HI>Brammon, Cuttery, Shuddery,</HI> and <HI>Wise.</HI> Of different constitutions. <HI>Bramon</HI> melancholy, <HI>Cuttery</HI> chollerick, <HI>Shudddery</HI> flegmatick; and <HI>Wise</HI> sanguin: Each affecting his se∣verall calling. The first a Priest, the second a Warrior, the third a Mer∣chant, the last a Pesant.</P>
<P><HI>Brammon</HI> the Priest (from whom the <HI>Brahman</HI> have their title, and not from <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Keturah,</HI> as <HI>Postellus</HI> thinketh) was commanded (sayes their <HI>Shaster</HI> or booke of lawes) to travell East to finde a wife; it being re∣vealed to him, that God had formed foure women for him and his brethren, on whom to propagate; (for the reason they had no sisters to generate upon, was, because so pure and holy a race as they, should not discend from filthy Incest.) After long and tedious pilgrimage and much prayer, he espies his long lookt for Virgin, cloathed with naked innocence, her face yellow like gold, her hayre and eyes black, of a compleat stature, who without much courting he won and marryed: this Lady <HI>Savatree</HI> proved the mother of a holy generation. <HI>Cuttery</HI> was sent west to find his mate, his sword in's hand, habited after his nature, all the while fretting for want of resistance, and that his patience was so long trod upon: at length, he espies a farre off one comming towards him, aequally inflamed with impatience; without much complement, they forthwith assailed each other, with such fury, and so much bravery, that the first dayes fight the victory was not to be decided; next day, they renew their courage, giving and receiving wounds
<PB N="41" REF="26"/>
insensibly, till in conclusion <HI>Cuttery</HI> grapled, and seiz'd <HI>Toddicastree</HI> by the tresses of her haire, but instead of subjecting her, is (by the fresh out breaking of her beauty) captivated; yet after submission and repentance for his rage against such an earthly Angell, shee is reconcil'd, and from them the West swarmed with a generation of Radiaes and Souldiers. <HI>Shuddery</HI> the third sonne of <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parcouty,</HI> travell North in equall hope to find his Mi∣stresse; farre he went and many strange adventures passed thorow and saw, wit∣nesse that rock of Diamonds he alight on, many of which (as any other Mer∣chant would have done) he carried along with him, enamoured of their lustre and sparkling excellencies: till at last he also met <HI>Visagundah,</HI> whom he soone woone, being of a tractable sweet nature and condition, (as be all the <HI>Bannyan</HI> daughters descended from her) and of her begot so many sonnes, that the North quickly became pregnant and inhabited. Now come we to <HI>Wyse</HI> (the simplest of Sir <HI>Pourous</HI> sonnes) a man of much plaine honesty and comport∣ment. Southward goes hee, having strange intelligence that his female was thereabouts, whom (after he had passed seven Seas (the breadth and way is concealed in the <HI>Shaster</HI>) and built him a faire Mansion, whither <HI>Iejunogundah</HI> (his future wife) came to admire so rare a structure; he saw her, &amp; not knowing how to court her, is o'recome with Loves passion; but long time is rejected and thought basely of, till (by divine providence) shee is mollified and made to yeeld, upon condition, hee should build many Pagods or Idols for Gods worship, and adore pictures under greene Trees and under Arbours, which to this day, his posterity observe ceremoniously. Thus from these two the South was filled with mechanick men, and such as practize tillage and husbandry.</P>
<P>When these foure young men had spent some yeares in those contrary quarters of the world, whither Fate had directed them. All foure becam equal∣ly mindfull of their first home, desirous to visit their aged parents, not onely to propagate there also, and furnish that Meditallium of the earth, but also to recount their memorable fortunes and adventures. After much circumstance and toile they arrived at the place from whence they came, each of them at∣tended by a troope of their owne younglins: tis in vaine to decipher the joy and mutuall embraces twixt them and their aged Parents, revived by this good hap from the benumming Frost of old age; as also the reciprocall kindnesse and love amongst the 4 Travellers, a dull sense may easily comprehend, it was without all mixture of discōtent or malady. Notwithstanding, to shew, no <HI>sum∣mum bonum</HI> can be had in this life, in processe of time (the issue of these foure multiplying) the world began to lose her virgin purity and candor; discord, pride, and rapine mingling amongst them, whereby all brotherly love was layd aside, and no appearance now but of violence &amp; voluptuousnesse: <HI>Bramon</HI> growes idle and carelesse in his devotion. <HI>Cuttery</HI> becomes insolent and aspi∣ring, regarding neither the venerable advice &amp; admonition of his Parents, nor the dignity of <HI>Bramon</HI> his elder brother. <HI>Shuddery</HI> also invents deceit, not re∣garding justice nor equity, but delights in cheating his other brethren. <HI>Wyse</HI> also growes unthrift in a good conscience, banishing his innate honesty to en∣tertaine ryot: For which, his cruell brother <HI>Cuttery</HI> domineeres and makes an Asse of him, imposing such taxes and burdens on that silly Countryman, that <HI>Wyse</HI> is now the object of casheered ryot, and the abject of his Lordly brother; who also picks a quarell with <HI>Shuddery,</HI> and admits not of any recon∣ciliation,
<PB N="42" REF="27"/>
till the poore Merchant had satisfied his Avarice with halfe his store; so that such hate and feare grew amongst 'em, that all their Designes are in∣volv'd in a dark Chaos of confusion. But though deceit, ryot, and tyrannie sway a while, an all-seeing Majesty sits above, who in his owne time retaliates in the extremity of justice. And so it now hapned: for upon a sudden, when they were most busied in their villany and least dreame of account, God roab's himselfe with clouds and flashes terrour, whereat the seas multiply their noise, and swell so formidably, that they threaten an universall deluge and destru∣ction: In the interim the amazed people are confounded with such horrible cracks of thunder, and such thick flashes of flame and lightning, that the en∣trailes of the earth seemed to gaspe and quake with terrour and feare: which done, in a moment the sea breaks ore her bounds, and sweepes away in eter∣nall darknesse and silence all creatures on the earth, purging away that nasty smell of their late wickednesse and pollution.</P>
<P>But God who delights in Mercy, and grieves at any mans confusion, repents him of his severity, and resolves againe to furnish the earth with a new gene∣ration of men repleat with more purity, mercy and perfection. To which end he descends, and upon a very high mountaine call'd <HI>Meropurbateé</HI> commands <HI>Bremaw</HI> to rise up, who (though till then not created) obeyed and worshipped his Maker. In like sort at two other calls, came up <HI>Vistney</HI> and <HI>Kuddery,</HI> who performed equall obeysance. <HI>Bremaw</HI> (to avoyd sloath) has power to create all other creatures. <HI>Vistney</HI> has order given to preserve them; and <HI>Rud∣dery</HI> has strength to massacre and be Gods executioner by way of death, plague, famine, diseases, warre, or the like. And according to this appointment, these three new created Lords performe and regard their particular affaires, to each of them a set period of time being alotted to live on earth. <HI>Bremaw</HI> at the end of the second Age in a fiery chariot was elevated. <HI>Vistney</HI> stayes double his time and then departs, leaving the issue to <HI>Ruddery,</HI> (at the end of three times so long commorance) to destroy the world, and to translate the soules of good men into a garden of most ravishing delights and glory. But ere this were ac∣complished, It is fit to acquaint you that how <HI>Bremaw</HI> came to furnish the earth with more Inhabitants. The <HI>Shaster</HI> or their Cabalisticall <HI>Thalmud</HI> tells us, that as <HI>Bremaw</HI> was ruminating how to act it, suddenly he fell into a trance, and upon recovery felt his body troubled beyond measure, purporting some im∣mediate chance or alteration. Nor did his thoughts deceive him; for loe, forthwith his body begun to swell, yea so great anguish to afflict him, that in all points it resembled a womans travaile, and indeed it had Analogie, in that his bowels began to extend more and more and his dolour to encrease, till (af∣ter much toyle) the second swellings found vent, broke, and deliver'd their burthen, two faire Twins, one of each sex whom hee needed not to give suck unto, in that by like miracle they immediatly grew up to a perfect stature, fur∣nisht with language, and many symptomes of education; <HI>Bremaw</HI> the Parent named them <HI>Manaw</HI> and <HI>Ceteroupa,</HI> whom after hee had blessed, he sent East to the great mountaine <HI>Mounder purvool,</HI> where strait way Mistresse <HI>Ceteroupa</HI> brought forth three sonnes and so many daughters: The Boyes she call'd, <HI>Pri∣auretta, Outanapautha,</HI> and <HI>Soomeraut.</HI> The Girles <HI>Cammah, Sounerettaw,</HI> and <HI>Sumboo:</HI> The eldest sonne and daughter went West to a huge mountaine <HI>Se∣gund.</HI> The two seconds North, to <HI>Bipola:</HI> The two last of each sex to <HI>Suparr,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="27"/>
where they so generated, that they quickly peopled each their quarter. Which done, God perceiving the hearts of men enclined to vice and all sorts of vile∣nesse, to give them directions how to live vertuously and avoyd temptation, he left heaven a while and alighted on the high Mount <HI>Meropurbatee,</HI> whither he call'd <HI>Bremaw,</HI> to whom hee spake many things out of a dusky dark cloud or mist, now and than flashing some glimpses of his Majesty, acquainting him why he destroy'd the first world, their sinnes provoking him, and how desi∣rous he was, never to doe so againe: and to that end deliver'd <HI>Bremaw</HI> a Book (the <HI>Shaster</HI> by name) fill'd with excellent stories, divided into three Tracts, dedicated to the three great Casts or Tribes: the first containing Morall pre∣cepts: the second, the ceremonies of their Worship: the third, a division of them into three, with peculiar notes and instructions to each Cast or Tribe.</P>
<P>Their Morall law (read and taught them by <HI>Bremaw</HI> out of the <HI>Shaster</HI>) has eight commandements.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thou shalt not kill nor destroy any living creature, for thou and it are both my creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2. Thou shalt not sinne in any of thy five senses: thy eyes not beholding vanity: thy eares to be stopt in hearing evill: thy tongue not to utter any fil∣thinesse: thy pallat hating wine, flesh, and all other vive things: thy hands ab∣horring things defiled.</P>
<P N="3">3. Thou shalt duly performe the set times of devotion, praying, washing, elevating, prostrating, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thou shalt not lie nor dissemble.</P>
<P N="5">5. Thou shalt not be hard hearted, but helpfull to others.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thou shalt not oppresse nor tyrannize.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thou shalt observe certaine Festivalls and fasting dayes:</P>
<P N="8">8. Thou shalt not steale.</P>
<P>These eight precepts are sub-divided into foure: each of the foure old Casts retaining them. <HI>Bramon</HI> and <HI>Shuddery,. i.e.</HI> the <HI>Braminy</HI> and <HI>Bannyan</HI> are tyed to most severe and strict observance in the decorum of their worship. <HI>Cuttery</HI> and <HI>Wyse. i.e.</HI> the Justice and Labourer agree in theirs. From whence the Priest and Merchants (appropriating the first and second to themselves) are more superstitious, than the two other Casts of Souldiers and Mechanicks, who assume a great liberty in meats and wine. Notwithstanding, all of them beleeve the Metempsychosis of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> whose conceits we will parallel by and by with these Bannyans. In this place drawing your judgement to a re∣membrance of what is already related: wherein, we may perceive the delusi∣on Sathan charmes them with, whose custome it has ever been to erect to him∣selfe worship and Idolatry in some things (to make 'em more authenticall) co∣hering with the Story of our Bible, and in imitation of the Jewes: and that this <HI>Cabala</HI> or <HI>Shaster</HI> of the Bannyans is a depraved Story of the Bible, either obtain'd by some Jewes, such time as <HI>Solomon</HI> traded to <HI>Ophyr</HI> (neere these parts) or from the father of lyes, who peradventure did dictate it for his ser∣vants. For in the <HI>Shaster,</HI> speaking of the Creation of the world out of a <HI>Chaos,</HI> and forming of <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parcoutee</HI> successively: who is so blind that sees not the making of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve:</HI> the other of the Creation (delivered by <HI>Moses</HI>) shadowed in't: the universall deluge and destruction of mankind pointing out that of <HI>Noah?</HI> By <HI>Bremaws</HI> receiving the Law from God (in a dark cloud and

lightning) upon the high Mount <HI>Meropurbatee,</HI> 'tis doubtlesse from <HI>Moses</HI> his being on <HI>Mount Syna</HI> in <HI>Arabya,</HI> where was given the Decalogue for the Is∣raelites instruction. And in <HI>Bremaws</HI> departure from earth to heaven, is meant the translation of <HI>Elias.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bannyans</HI> are commanded (as in most hot Countries in all other Pagan Religious is observed) to wash often. First, dawbing their naked bodies with dirt and mud (the Embleam of sinne) then, diving three times in the water, their faces to the East, shaking a few graines of Rice as a Thanksgiving to that element for purging them: A three-fold ducking and tripartite thred is hung at three holes in a stone about the neck, the Rice fixed in their forehead each morne in an unguent of red paint, is a Symbol of Baptisme: Their turning to the East, in memory of the judgement and creation, and to adore the Sun and Moone, in that they take them to be Gods eyes, full of purity, heat and nurture. But this their attending the blushing Sunne at his arising, the eleva∣tion of their hands, murmurs, plashing the water in Magick order, diving, wri∣thing and acting other promiscuous foperies, heare them condemned by a neighbour of theirs <HI>Iob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iob</HI> 31, 26.7, 8.</NOTE> that patient Edomite. <HI>If I beheld the Sunne when it shined, or the Moone walking in brightnesse, and my heart hath been secretly inti∣ced, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: this also were an iniquity to be punished by the Iudge, for I should thereby have denied the God which is above.</HI> And by the Psalmist, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 44 41.</NOTE> <HI>If wee have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any strange god, shall not God (who knowes the secrets of the heart) search it out?</HI></P>
<P>But above all, their horrid Idolatry to Pagods (or Images of deformed de∣vils) is most observable: Placed in Chappels most commonly built under the Bannyan Trees (or that which <HI>Linschot</HI> call'd <HI>Arbor de Rays</HI> or tree of roots, Sir <HI>Wal. Ral.</HI> improperly <HI>Ficus Indicus</HI>) a tree of such repute amongst 'em, that they hold it impiety to abuse it, either in breaking a branch or otherwise, but contrarily adorne it with Streamers of silk and ribbons of all colours. The Pagods are of sundry sorts and resemblances, in such shape as Satan visibly ap∣peares unto them: ugly faced, long black haire, gogl'd eyes, wide mouth, a forked beard, hornes and stradling, mishapen and horrible, after the old filthy forme of <HI>Pan</HI> and <HI>Priapus.</HI></P>
<P>Under these holy Trees they sit and actuate their Idolatrous devotion: there they pay their Tythes and Offrings, there receive the sacred unction and sprinklings of sundry colour'd powders: there they performe their ceremo∣nies, which they denotate by the wooden sound of a little Bell: there they repeat their Orizons, make Processions, ring their Bells, sing and performe ma∣ny mysteries; yea, so numerous grew their Idoll Temples, that (till the Mus∣sulmen mixt among them) each Village had its severall Pagods, and many to this day are standing. The chiefe in <HI>Industan</HI> is at <HI>Variaw</HI> neere <HI>Surrat,</HI> at <HI>Ni∣gracut</HI> where the Dewry is seel'd and paved with gold, yeerely visited by 1000 Bannyans, who in way of devotion cut out part of their tongues as a holy sa∣crifice, and whereby to speake the Sibboleth better ever after: at <HI>Bannaras</HI> upon <HI>Ganges,</HI> at <HI>Ecbarpore,</HI> at <HI>Iallamexa, Elabass, Sibah,</HI> and many other places. Other parts of their Religion consists in invocating holy men famoused for many vertues. In Warres (the Cutterys or Radieas onely) call upon <HI>Bemo∣hem:</HI> the rich upon <HI>Mycasser;</HI> the poore upon <HI>Syer:</HI> the labourers upon
<PB N="45" REF="28"/>
<HI>Gunner:</HI> the married, upon <HI>Hurmount,</HI> &amp;c. Moreover, they effect Pilgrima∣ges to rivers, especially <HI>Gonga (Ganges)</HI> more venerable then any other, in that they say <HI>Bremaw</HI> frequented it, and that it has (at <HI>Siba</HI> where it springs out of a rock) a head in forme of a Cow their beloved Idol: wherein they Wash oft, and thereby suppose themselves purified from sinne (and durt:) and in requitall enrich her womb with Gold and Jewels, hoping to thrive the better, especi∣ally when they die to have their mouthes madefied with a drop of that water of the terrestriall Paradise.</P>
<P>In Baptisme, the Priests children and Marchants (that is to say Bramins and Bannyans) anoynt with Oyle, and clense by water. The other prophaner sort, the men of warre and manifactures have onely water, with the point of a pen opposed to their forehead, as wishing that God will write good things there, to which the company say <HI>Amen.</HI> Their Marriages (as I have said) are at seven yeares old, and if any die unmarried, they conclude him in <HI>limbo:</HI> so that oft times they marry them, when dead, afore they be buried: the Marri∣age ceremonies are not many nor frivolous; the Boy riding about the Towne attended with all the little ones that can ride, roab'd with Jewels, Scarfes, &amp;c. one day. And the Mayden Bride the next with a like trayne of dainty virgins no lesse richly attired, the Bride and her Husband knowne from the rest by their Crownes and Coronets, celebrated by many Kettle Drummes, Trum∣pets, Pageants, and the like; the Bride has no money Portion, they hold it contemptible: onely some Jewels and Dinaes of gold, such as they that day are attired with. I dare not say those Dinaes are those <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Marriage gifts mentioned by <HI>Homer</HI> 9 Ilyad, <HI>Suydas,</HI> &amp;c. The Wedding is thus, a fire is interpos'd, intimating the purity and heat of their affections: a silken string circles both their bodies as the Hyerogliphic or bond of Wedlock; then a linnen cloath is put betwixt them, in token that till then they were unknowne to one another in nakednesse. This done, the Bramyn blesses them, prayes that she may prove as gentle and fruitfull as a Cow, the cloath is torne away, the string untyed, and they are one anothers ever after. Also they never marry out of their owne Casts or Tribe: as Bramins the daughters of <HI>Bramyns:</HI> Cutterys, the daughters of <HI>Cutterys:</HI> Shudderys <HI>Shudderys;</HI> and <HI>Wyses</HI> not onely so, but also compere in their owne Trades: as Taylers, the daughters of Taylers: Barbers, Barbers daughters &amp;c.</P>
<P>In sicknesse they call upon <HI>Marrawn</HI> (an Epithite of God) expressing mercy. If they perceive he is going the way of all flesh, then they expand his hand, and moysten it with holy water, the water of <HI>Ganges:</HI> when he is dead they wash the carcasse and carry it silently to the water side, where they utter two or three words to that element, then burne his body in sweet wood or spices, which as earth mixes with the corps, and throwing the ashes into the River, they think they have given every Element his peculiar due, and so depart home well satisfied forthwith. The Priests present his sonne the roll of his deceased fore-fathers, and bid him fulfill the ceremoniall law of deploring for ten dayes, neither using his wife, laughing, eating <HI>Opium</HI> nor <HI>Betele,</HI> put∣ting on no cleane cloathes nor oyle on's head, but that day moneth for that yeare ever after make a feast, and pay a complementall visit to that River, that drunk his Fathers ashes. Oft times the wife (to expresse her love) incenerates her selfe at that time her Husbands body was incendiated. They affect no se∣cond
<PB N="46" REF="29"/>
marriages, the <HI>Raieaes</HI> and <HI>Wyses</HI> excepted. Now the reason why they burne their dead, is either in imitation of those recorded by the Prophet <HI>Amos</HI> 6.10. or in way of pitty and piety, lest the enemy should offer it villany; or if buried, it would stink (an improper thing in a Bannyan) and so putrifie the grasse and make Kine unhealthy: besides, out of their carcasses would issue wormes, who would starve when the dead body was consumed, a sinne un∣pardonable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Braminy</HI> or Priests (to speake in common) are of 82 Casts or Tribes, the <HI>Vertaes</HI> are of higher note and fewer: their habit is a girdle of an Anti∣lops skinne tied about their middle, a thong of the same hide from the necke to the left arme, and elsewhere naked; some of them weare a threefold thred from the right shoulder to the left arme as a badge of their profession and in memory of the 3 sonnes of the second creation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cutteries</HI> are more prophane; men of warre, shedders of blood, flesh-eaters, and libidinous; they are for the greater part called Rajas or Kings; have six and thirty Casts among themselves, from some of which none of them but is descended: of these, are the Tribes of <HI>Dodepuchaes,</HI> some <HI>Chaw∣ah,</HI> some <HI>Solenkees,</HI> some <HI>Vaggelaes,</HI> and some <HI>Paramors;</HI> of long times owners of <HI>Indostant,</HI> till <HI>Aladin,</HI> a <HI>patan,</HI> King of <HI>Delly,</HI> wrested <HI>Guzzarat</HI> from them, and since then, most is taken away by the issue of <HI>Tamerlange:</HI> at this day they call themselves <HI>Rashpootes</HI> (or sonnes of Kings) and live law∣lesse to the Moores, the chiefe of which at this day are <HI>Rana Radgee Mardout, Radga Surmul-gee, Raia Berumshaw, Mahobet-chan, Radia Barmulgee, Radgea Ramnagar, Radgea Iooh', Iessingh, Tzettersing,</HI> and <HI>Mansuigh, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Shudderyes or Bannyans are Merchants, and (contrary to their name, which significs harmlesse) are the most crafty people throughout <HI>India.</HI> Full of flegmatick feare and superstition: they are indeed very mercifull, grieving to see other people so hard-hearted to feed upon fish, flesh, Raddish, and such things as have life or any resemblance. They will not kill a Louse, Flea, or Kakaroch, or the like for 1000 pound; but contrariwise buy their liberty of such Saylers as of necessity must crush them: yea, they have Hospitalls for old, lame, sick, or starved creatures, birds, beasts, Cats, Rats, or the like, and have no worse men to oversee them than the <HI>Pushelans,</HI> the greatest and best respected sorts of Brammins of all Casts whatsoever: they are of <HI>Pythagora's</HI> do∣ctrinating, not only in beleeving the Metempsychosis of the soule of each man into a beast: as for example, the soule of a drunkard and Epicure into a Swine, the lustfull and incestuous into Goats and Dogs; the dissemblers into Apes, Crocodiles, and Foxes: the lazie into Beares, the wrathfull into Tygers, the proud into Lyons, the bloud thirsty into Wolves, Ounces, Snakes; the per∣jur'd into Toads, and the like: but the soules of good men, abstemious, pitti∣full and courteous, into Kine, Buffalaes, Sheepe, Storks, Doves, Turtles, &amp;c.

<P><PB N="47" REF="29"/>The last Sect or Cast of Gentiles are the <HI>Wises,</HI> a name albeit derived from <HI>Wise</HI> the youngest sonne of <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parcootee,</HI> yet in their tongue pro∣perly signifying a labouring man: these be of two sorts, the <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Coolee;</HI> the first agreeing with the <HI>Bannyan</HI> in abstinence, the other not forbearing to eat any manducable creature; the purer sort are subdevided into 36 Casts or Families.</P>
<P>The conclusion is, that all these 4 Casts in time grew so impious and un∣thankfull, that God commanded <HI>Ruddery</HI> to command a blast of wind to sweep away this wretched generation, which accordingly he did; that tem∣pest raging so violently that the mountaines and rocks were hurled to and fro like dust or tennis-balls, the seas out of their course, yea <HI>Ganges</HI> out of her holy channell, wherein all (save a few honest men and women left to reple∣nish) perished; this was the second confusion. Soone after, God gave them a King, propagate from the seed of the <HI>Bramyns</HI> cald <HI>Ducerat,</HI> who begat <HI>Ram,</HI> a King so famous for piety and high attempts, that to this day his name is ex∣ceedingly honoured, so that when they say <HI>Ram Rame,</HI> 'tis as if they should say, <HI>all good betide you.</HI></P>
<P>But to shew the imbecillity of mans nature, his weak condition and frailty: in processe of time the world again grew abominable and treacherous: so that <HI>Ruddery</HI> commands the earth to open and swallow down quick those ungodly wretches; a few excepted, who the third time peopled the earth with humane inhabitants, and then (as <HI>Bremaw</HI> had formerly) <HI>Vistney</HI> the mediator of mer∣cy ascended into heaven, leaving cruell <HI>Ruddery</HI> to over rule this age of Iron, at the end of which he also shall be rapt into paradise: these 4 ages they call <HI>Curtain, Duauper, Tetrajoo</HI> and <HI>Kolee.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the last Iudgement, they hold it shall be more dreadfull than the other; the Moone to look blood red, the Sunne to shed his light like purling brimstone, an universall flashing of fire, with loudest thundring; then a flammy rednesse will orespread the heavens, and the 4 Elements (of which the world consists) shall maintaine a dreadfull fight so long, so fiercely one against another, that at last all shall be revolved into a dark confusion: the soules of such as were good men, <HI>Ruddery</HI> will transport to heaven, the wicked perish; but the bodies of both rise no more, being too incredulous of the resurrection.</P>
<P>Now albeit these people in a continued series of wilfulnesse and ignorance beleeve that their <HI>Shaster</HI> or <HI>Cabala</HI> was immediately from God, yet that it is wholly grounded upon tradition, and parched out of many Histories, Iewish and Gentilisme, I have already shewed what is in imitation of the holy Scrip∣ture and from the rule and practise of other Nations: and we may adde, that their burning the dead, is borrowed from the 6 of <HI>Amos</HI> 10. their marriage after death from <HI>Cerinthus</HI> and <HI>Marcyon,</HI> old hereticks who used to baptize after death in case they were not pre-baptiz'd; the thred tripartite hung about their neck is a misterious denotation of the Trinity; rice and painting in their forehead is not only as a symbole of Baptisme, but in imitation of the Starre <HI>Rempham</HI> fixed in the brow of the Idoll <HI>Moloch,</HI> or of <HI>Iul. Caesar,</HI> who had one in his forehead as an embleme of immortality. And also, let us see in how many things they concurre with the rules of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> (to this day famous among them).

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of the Persaes.</NOTE>Into <HI>India</HI> I say these <HI>Persees</HI> came, (such time as <HI>Omar</HI> the second <HI>Chaliph</HI> after <HI>Mabumet</HI> had subjected <HI>Persia</HI>) in 5 <HI>Iuncks</HI> from <HI>Iasquez</HI> sayling to <HI>Surrat,</HI> where after some treaty with the <HI>Raieas</HI> and <HI>Bannyans</HI> they got entertain∣ment and leave to exercise their owne religion. A religion deduced from the raigne of <HI>Gustaph</HI> King of <HI>Persia Anno Mundi</HI> 3500, and before our Sa∣viours Incarnation 500 yeeres, written in their <HI>Zundavastaw</HI> (or law Booke) in this manner.</P>
<P>Such time as <HI>Gustasp</HI> (the 14 King of <HI>Persia</HI> from <HI>Kuyomarraz,</HI> by some, thought <HI>Naah</HI>) swayed the Imperiall Scepter of that famous Monarchy: It chanced that <HI>Espintaman</HI> and <HI>Dodoo</HI> two poore people, man and wife, <HI>Chynaes</HI> by nation, lived long together in a good report, but without Fortunes bles∣sings, in estate or children: howbeit, at <HI>Dodooes</HI> earnest request, a sonne was given her who in his conception promised (by some rare and fearfull dreames the mother hatched) great matters, not only to the astonishment of his sim∣ple parents but amazement of the <HI>China</HI> King, who (out of jealousie and dis∣position to credit any report) sought to prevent all events by killing or poy∣soning him: but (to shew a superior power swayes us and never misses to ac∣complish its designes tho by man never so much oppugned) nothing could do him harme; for fearing his parents ruine, and to ease the King of his feares, they all consent to give <HI>China</HI> a farewell, and seek a securer abode in a region more remote, and where they might more freely meditate.</P>
<P>Farre they travelled, saw many rare things, past over many great rivers on foot, for <HI>Zertoost</HI> (so was this young prophet named) turned them by a trick that he had into solid Ice, and after thawed them at his pleasure and many rare adventures found, (all which are to be left out, in that religion is the marke we shoot at) not staying long in any place till they arrived in <HI>Persia,</HI> where they rested and intended to settle: <HI>Zertoost</HI> (as all good men use to doe) spent most of his time in meditation; and on a time especially, obser∣ving the disorder of mens living, sorrow overcame him, and a desire to re∣forme

them totally possessed him: but finding the place he was in not solitary enough or fit for revelations, away he goes, not resting till he came into a dark valley, surrounded and obscured by two lofty mountaines, there he inge∣minates his silent murmures, with dejected eyes, erected hands, and knees bended, when loe, a glorious Angell, whose face was more coruscant than the Sunne, salutes him thus, Hayle, <HI>Zertoost,</HI> a man of God, what wouldst thou? he strait answers; The presence of God, to receive his will, to instruct my nation: his prayer is granted, his body purged; his eyes sealed; till being past the Element of fire and higher orbes, he is presented afore the supreame Majesty, arrayed with such refulgent glory, that (till he had Angells eyes put into his head) he could not gaze on such a daz'ling excellency: there, he re∣ceived his lawes (no place but heaven will serve to fetch Philosophy, as <HI>La∣ertius</HI> writes of <HI>Socrates</HI>) uttered by the Almighty (whose words were in∣compast with flames of fire:) such lawes, such secrets, as some of them are not fit to be promulgated. Being upon his departure, he desires of God, that he might live so long as the world indured, that in that protract hee might the easier make all people on the earth imbrace his doctrine: God pitties his simplicity and in a mirrour shewes him the alteration of times, the villany of Lucifer, the misery of man, and many other rarities such as quite altred his first desires; so that, when he had worshipped, he takes his Zundavastaw or Book in 's left hand, and some celestiall Fire in 's right, and by <HI>Baha∣man Vmshauspan</HI> the foresaid Angell (who cleft the Ayre with his gol∣den wings) is set downe in that same valley where the spirit found him.</P>
<P><HI>Zertoost</HI> (by this time a man of great experience) armes himselfe against all disasters and temptations, and bidding his Hermitage farewell, travells home∣ward, to publish his law and joy his too long afflicted parents: Satan (who all this while lookt asquint at <HI>Zertoosts</HI> determinations) intends to seduce him, and after a short excuse for his rude intrusion, protests himselfe his unfained friend, assuring him the Angell had deluded him; that God hated his novell indeavors; that if he had loved him, he had not so soone so willingly parted with him, that his denying him to live till the day of doome, argued Gods neglect of him; that his travaile to reclaime the world was in vaine, mens minds so doated upon freedome and vanity; that his booke was stuft with lies, and in publishing it great shame and perill should betide him: that his fire, was a mercilesse Element, rediculous and of small use in those hot regi∣ons. And in conclusion, if he would reject these and depend on him, hee would furnish him with all delights, honours and pleasures possible, give him power to do strange things, whereby hee should bee worshipped for a God, which if he refused he was a foole and unworthy his charity.</P>
<P><HI>Zertoost</HI> soone saw that tempter was no better nor worse than <HI>Lucifer:</HI> he bad him avoid, and call to mind to his addition of terror, how by his ambiti∣ous impiety he had lost heaven, and how meere malice made him desirous to draw all other into like damnation: he also told him how that booke he so scoft at should condemne him, that fire torture him and all such black mouth'd lyers and detracters as himselfe; whereat the Fiend was horribly affrighted and left him: the divell is no sooner gone, but on goes <HI>Zertoost</HI> and at length arrived where he found his parents who (you doubt not of) received him glad∣ly; to whom he imparted his passed fortunes and intended occasions. <HI>Dodoo</HI>

his mother (that good old woman) imagines it a sinne unpardonable, that so excellent a young prophet (as she thought her sonne) should be longer con∣cealed from the world; yea grew so transported, that she thought all men wicked blockheads that could not find it out without her babling it: but see∣ing them dull, to them she goes and without longer circumstance tells them the whole story of her sonnes conception, her dreams, his piety, his enthu∣siasticks, revelations, visions, the excellency of his booke, his authority to command all men to believe and obey his lawes and ordinances. The people admire and blazon it, so that in short time <HI>Gustasp</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> King had notice of it, who desiring to see the man and know the truth, sends for him, is so well sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied and instructed, that he forthwith wavered in his owne religion, judging <HI>Zertoosts</HI> better and more plausible; insomuch, as his owne Priest became dejected, and invented all wayes possible to reclaime him; and to ef∣fect it, bribes <HI>Zertoosts</HI> servants to convey under his bed the bones of dead men and dead dogs carkasses, things most hatefull to the <HI>Persians,</HI> possessing the King that this stranger was a banisht man, a man of a most impure conver∣sation, witnesse the stuffing of the bed he slept upon: the King is brought to view that nasty deceit, abominates him, and for his reward shuts him in a loathsome dungeon, but this misery of his endured not long; for the King, ha∣ving a horse of great account deadly ill, proposes great rewards to any could recover him; many desired it, but none durst undertake it, fearing the pe∣nalty, till <HI>Zertoost</HI> heard it who administers a potion and recovers him: an act so acceptable to <HI>Gustasp</HI> that he receives the poore prophet into grace again, wherby he had the way to discover the Kings priests knavery and to illustrate his owne integrity; yea, a means whereby to publish his owne doctrine, and by some miracles intermixt to have it credited.</P>
<P>It chanced that the King (either stimulated by his Churchmen, or judg∣ing <HI>Zertoost</HI> able to do any thing) calls for him, professing his propensity to be of his religion, and which he and all his would entertaine, upon condition <HI>Zertoost</HI> would grant him 4 things: the first, that he might never die; the se∣cond, that hee might ascend heaven and come downe againe without hurt as often as hee listed; the third, that hee might know what God had done, did, and intended; the fourth, that his body might bee in∣vulnerable.</P>
<P><HI>Zertoost</HI> is somewhat thunder-struck with these demands: But perceiving it otherwise impossible to have his Dogmataes believed, hee tells the King, that for one man to have all those properties was to make him a God, more than a man; that the King should choose any one for himselfe, and the other 3 things be given any other three men he pleasd to nominate: 'tis accepted, and <HI>Gustasp</HI> makes the second his choice, that he might ascend and descend at pleasure; to know the secrets of heaven was granted the Kings Churchman, the better thereby to governe; to live for ever, is confer'd upon <HI>Pischiton</HI> (the Kings eldest sonne) who they say lives yet upon <HI>Damoan's</HI> high moun∣taine guarded by 30 immortall men, to forbid all others the entrance, lest by footing that holy ground they should also live for ever; and to be free in battell or otherwise from hurt or torment was granted to <HI>Espandiar</HI> the Kings youngest sonne; after which the <HI>Zundavastaw</HI> is opened, the new broacht doctrine read and generally accepted on.</P>

<P>The <HI>Zertoost</HI> is also of three parts; pointing at 3 sorts of men; the Lay∣men, Clergy, and Archbishop; to every of them it directs an increase of commandements; to the first sort 5, to the second 11, to the third 13; the com∣pendium of which we will only manifest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Behedins</HI> or Lay-mens 5 precepts be these.</P>
<P N="1">1. To cherish modesty and shame fastnesse: a vertue deterring all sorts of ugly vices and concupiscence, as pride, revenge, theft, adultery, drunken∣nesse, and perfidy. The 2, to cherish feare. 3. To use premeditation in what they are to do; that if bad, reject it; if good, to act it. 4. Each dayes first object to be a memento of Gods love to urge our gratitude. 5. To pray daily to the Sunne, and nightly to the Moone, as the only 2 great lamps and wit∣nesses, and most opposite to the divell who delights in darknesse.</P>
<P>The 11, given the <HI>Herboods, Daroos</HI> or Priests to practise, are these (the other also of the <HI>Behedin</HI> they observe). 1. To be constant in that forme of worship set downe precisely in the <HI>Zundevastaw.</HI> 2. Not to covet what belongs to any other man. 3. To abhorre lyes. 4. Not to be worldly minded. 5. To learne the <HI>Zundavastaw</HI> by rote. 6. To keep himselfe free from all manner of pollu∣tion. 7. To forgive all sorts of injuries. 8. To teach the Laity how to pray and convene in adoration. 9. To license Matrimony. 10. To be frequent at Church. 11. Vpon paine of fire eternall, to beleeve in no other law, neither to adde nor to diminish it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Distoore</HI> or <HI>Pope</HI> (never but one at once) has 13, and as hee per∣cedes the rest in dignity, so is his life most strict and observable; he performes not onely his owne but the two former Tables also. 1.

He must do every thing having relation to himselfe with his owne hands, as planting, sowing, cooking, &amp;c. 3. That hee duly receive his Tith or the Tenth of what the Layety are possessers of. 4. That hee avoid pompe and vaine-glory, but ra∣ther with his great income do acts of charity. 5. That his house so con∣joyne the Church, as hee may be there oft and go and come without being much seene or taken notice of. 6. That his washings be more frequent than others, his food purer, and that he refraine his wives company during her pollution. 7. That he not only be perfect in the <HI>Zertoost (a capite ad calcem)</HI> as is the <HI>Herbood,</HI> but also be of greatest knowledge in the other parts, as Iudiciall and Naturall Philosophy. 8. That his dyet be very moderate. 9. That he feare none but God. 10. That he tell every man (how great soever) of his offences. 11. That he distinguish twixt good and counterfeit visions or fancies, and give right judgement. 12 That whensoever God reveales or communicates his goodnesse or glory to him in nightly visions, he admire his mercy and keep them secret. 13.

<P>They are tollerated all sorts of meat; but (in obedience to the Mahomitan and Bannyan 'mongst whom they live) refraine Beefe and Hog flesh: they seldome feed together, lest they might participate one anothers impurity: each has his owne cap; and if any of his owne Cast chance to use it, hee washes it three times, and forbeares it a good while after: they observe six solemne Fe∣stivalls annually; the first call'd <HI>Meduserum,</HI> kept the 15 of <HI>Fere</HI> or <HI>February;</HI> 2. <HI>Petusahan,</HI> on the 26 of <HI>Sheruar</HI> or <HI>Aprill;</HI> 3. <HI>Yatrum,</HI> on the 26 of <HI>Mahar</HI> or <HI>May;</HI> 4. <HI>Medearum,</HI> on the 16 of <HI>Deh</HI> or <HI>August,</HI> 5. <HI>Homespetamadum,</HI> on the 30 of <HI>Spindamud</HI> or <HI>October;</HI> 6. <HI>Medusan,</HI> on the 11 of <HI>Adebese</HI> or <HI>Decem∣ber;</HI> all of them in memory of the Creation and monethly benefits.

<P>Their Marriages in briefe are thus: distinguisht into five orders. 1. <HI>Shaulan,</HI> or a marrying of two young children agreed on by each parents, but unknown to the children; the vertue being, that if either die they goe to heaven. 2. <HI>Chockerson,</HI> a second marriage. 3. <HI>Codesherahasan,</HI> when the woman is her owne chooser. 4. <HI>Ecksan,</HI> when a dead body (not being married before) is married. 5. <HI>Ceterson,</HI> when having no sonnes, he adopts his daughters son, &amp;c. the Coremony this: at midnight the Daroo or Priest enters the house, (they wed not in Churches) finds the two parties (to be married) upon a bed toge∣ther; opposite to each other stands two Churchmen with Ryce in their hands (the Emblem of fruitfulnesse:) then first, one laying his fore-finger on the Brides forehead, he asks if she be willing to take that man to be her Husband, who saying yea: the like rite and question is by the other Priest done to the man; the Bridegroome makes a promise to infeoff her in a certaine number of Dynaes: she replyes, she and all she has is his; the Priests then scatter the Ryce upon their heads and pray, that they may multiply as Ryce; the wo∣mans parents give the Dowry, and eight dayes are spent in joviality and com∣plement.</P>
<P>Their Funeralls are these: They put the dead body into a winding sheet, all the way his kindred beat themselves but in great silence till they come within 50 or 100 paces of the buriall place: where the Herbood or Priest meets them (observing ten foot distance) attired in a yellow scarfe and a thin Turbant: the Necesselars or bearers carry the corps upon an iron Beere (wood is forbidden, in that it is sacred to the fire) to a little Shed or Furnace, where (so soone as some mistique Antiques are acted) they hoyse it up to the top of a round stone building, twelve foot high and 80 in circuit: the entrance is only at the N. E. side, where through a small grate or hole they conveigh the car∣casse into a common Monument, the good men into one, the bad into another; tis flat above, wholy open, plaistered with smooth white loame, hard and smooth like that of Paris; in the midst thereof is a hole descending to the bot∣tome, made to let in the putrifaction issuing from the melted bodies, which are there-upon layd naked in two rowes, exposed to the Sunnes flaming rage,

and mercilesse appetite of ravening Vultures, who commonly are fed by these carcases, tearing the raw flesh asunder, and deforming it in an ugly sort; so that the abominable stink of those unburied bodies (in some places 300) is so loath∣some and strong, that (did not a desire to see strange sights allure a Traveller) they would prove worse seene than spoken of; Nor doe the Persees delight that any stranger should goe op to view them.</P>

<HEAD>The History of the great Mogull.</HEAD>
<P>LEt us now into <HI>Industan,</HI> and by the best helps and enquiries we can make, weave the variable History of the great Mogulls; their pedegree; their descent from <HI>Tartary:</HI> their severall conquests and successe in <HI>Indya;</HI> with other most remarkable occurrents hapning there, these last 50 yeares: also the description of such Cities, Provinces, and Forts as either enrich or support that glorious Empire: the knowing which may peradventure (I doubt it not) finde gratious acceptance amongst the more ingenuous, who know that man is the compendium of the world, and admirable in his Designes, which yet are crost by the awfull finger of God, when men intend that which thwarts his providence. Nor can you lend your eares to any nobler part of the Uni∣verse, which for spatiousnesse, abundance of faire Townes, numberlesse Inha∣bitants, infinite treasure, mines, food and all sorts of Merchandizes, exceeds all Kings and Potentates in the Mahometan world: his vast (but well com∣pacted) Monarchy, extending East and West to the Bengalan Gulph and <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean.

Howbeit, out of this prodigious rent, goes yearely many great payments: to his Leiftenants of Provinces, and Vmbraves of Townes and Forts; having also in continuall pay three hundred thousand Horse, and 2000 Elephants, fed with Donna or Poulse boil'd with Butter and unrefined Sugar; to these onely, his Fiscall or Treasurer yearely giving out above forty milli∣ons of crownes; his continuall warres are no lesse chargeable.</P>
<P>The pedigree of these <HI>Mogulls</HI> is thus upon their owne seales blazoned. 1. <HI>Aben-Emyr-Temir-Saheb-Queran</HI> (i.e. <HI>Tamberlane,</HI> great Prince of the foure quarters of the world:) 2. <HI>Aben-Miram-Sha:</HI> 3. <HI>Aben Mirza Sultan Mohum∣med:</HI> 4. <HI>Aben Sultan Abusaid:</HI> 5. <HI>Aben mirza-Emir-sha:</HI> 6. <HI>Aben Baber-potshaugh:</HI> 7. <HI>Aben Homayon potshaw:</HI> 8, <HI>Aben Ecbar,</HI> cald also <HI>Abdul fetta ghelaladyn Ma∣humed Achbar:</HI> 9. <HI>Shaw Selim</HI> or <HI>Aben Almozapher Nordin Iangheer potshaugh Gazi:</HI> 10. <HI>Sultan Curroon</HI> or <HI>Shaw Iehan,</HI> now cald <HI>Sultan potshaugh Bedin Mohumet.</HI></P>
<P>They have a larger genealogy; from <HI>Cingis-chan</HI> a Prince of <HI>Tartary</HI> (whom some have feigned) sonne of <HI>Babur,</HI> sonne of <HI>Portan,</HI> of <HI>Philcan,</HI> of <HI>Phonama,</HI> of <HI>Bizanbeg,</HI> of <HI>Shaw-dub-chan,</HI> of <HI>Tomincan,</HI> of <HI>Bubacan,</HI> sonne of <HI>Buzamer</HI> all of them brave men as story warrants us.</P>
<P><HI>Cingis-chan</HI> (as <HI>Haithon</HI> and others say, his contemporaries) was at first by profession a Vulcan or Black-smith, by condition a good honest simple man: but the influence of heaven new moulded him, in little time in stead of his hammer, putting into his hands the Globe and Scepter: his ambitious thoughts begun from the frequent incouragements a man in white Armour (mounted upon a white phantasma) gave him, promising his helpe, and stimu∣lating his courage, tells the vision to some chiefe hoords or cantons, who give credit to his destiny and make him their generall; he shewes quickly how his grosse mettall was refined by a better fire, with a troop of Mogli (one of the 7 hoords) marching South subduing as farre as mount <HI>Belgian,</HI> part of <HI>Imaus,</HI> at this day cald <HI>Nigrakott,</HI> and <HI>Copizat</HI> by the <HI>Indians;</HI> there the sea stopt his carriere, but he prostrates himselfe and 9 times over fumbles out his prayers: the effect followes; the hill clove asunder, the sea parts in two and yeelds them 9 foot safe passage: but being upon the continent he hammers out his way with rusty iron, doing such marvellous feates of Armes as to a good faith seemes wonderfull. I shall as briefly as may be trace his posterity to <HI>Tamber∣lane:</HI> for from his grand-sonnes, we must borrow our maine history.</P>

<P>This young Prince (by such an accident mounted to the Imperiall great∣nesse) perceives the eyes of all about him inflam'd with envy, and threatning his expulsion, inraged by the villany of some that whisperd out his guilt in the last infants death: so that (albeit hee was armd with integrity and a just Title) he contracts for his defence with some confining potentates, and gave them the honour and command of severall provinces of his Empire upon condition they would hold of him in chiefe, and be ready upon all occasions to defend him; To <HI>Rablay-cawn</HI> he gave <HI>Ketoachotan</HI> and the royall City <HI>Cam∣baleck:</HI> to <HI>Vlakuc-cawn</HI> (his brother,) <HI>Persia, Chusistan,</HI> and <HI>Cherman:</HI> and to <HI>Chun-cawn, Gaznehen:</HI> but ere hee had occasion to try the malice and incon∣stancy of his men or chance of warre, death summond him away, <HI>Anno</HI> 1260 but not before hee had nominated <HI>Vlacuk-cawn</HI> for Emperour; who proved of another spirit, his best delight being to dance in Armour to <HI>Bellonaes</HI> Trumpe, and to defend his owne in despight of all his adversaries by his owne vertue, without secundary props or other allyances: he first quiets his dome∣stick broyles composing peace at home, then magnifies his excellencies in for∣raine parts, in circling and adding to the lustre of his dyadem, <HI>Babylon,</HI> a great part of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and in <HI>Syria, Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Damascus;</HI> all which, during his life he kept in subjection and loyalty, and ruled with much magnificence, to the yeer 1270. when, (by the extremity of his disease finding death at hand) hee calls his 3 sonnes afore him, exhorts them to unity, divides his lands among them, dyes, and at <HI>Meragah</HI> 15 farsangs from <HI>Tauris</HI> was solemnly buried. <HI>Hab∣kay-cawn</HI> the eldest, had the provinces of <HI>Hyerac, Mozendram,</HI> and <HI>Korazan;</HI> (comprehending <HI>Medya, Parthya, Hyrcania, Bactria, and Sogdiana.</HI>) To <HI>Hya-Shawmet, Aro</HI> &amp; <HI>Adarbayon</HI> (part of <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Iberia</HI> comprizing <HI>Salmas, Coy, Nazivan, Maraga</HI> and <HI>Merent,</HI> Cities of quality.)

but amongst the Innocent bath'd his sword in blood, so that hee became hatefull to his owne, and stimulated the Parthian to revenge, by whom in a battell hee is overcome, and by <HI>Argon-chan</HI> upbraided with his cruelty, yea to compensate the like measure, is cruelly tormented, his belly ript open, and his guts given to the doggs. To <HI>Tangador</HI> (the inveterate Ene∣mie of all Christians) succeeds his brother <HI>Giviatoc-chan,</HI> who in the fourth yeare of his reigne perisht by <HI>Balduc-chan</HI> his Uncle, who also after five yeares rule died issue-lesse. <HI>Badu</HI> sonne of <HI>Targahe</HI> youngest sonne to <HI>Vla∣cuk-chan,</HI> by assent of all that Nation succeeding in the throne of great∣nesse, whose affections he answered with so much respect, clemency, and care, that never any before him was more belov'd and honored: howbeit, when he openly profest himselfe to be a Christian, the peoples regard drew back, and many treasons (fomented by Satan) were hatched against him, so that at last he was slaine (or rather martyr'd) by <HI>Gazun-chan,</HI> Co∣zen to <HI>Tangador,</HI> who had small cause to bragge of his treachery, or time to surfet of his glory; for, by the permissive hand of God, in <HI>Cazbyn,</HI> when he lest suspected treason, hee is wounded to death by his owne houshold-servants <HI>Anno</HI> 1305, and of the <HI>Hegira</HI> 685, and lay long time unburied.</P>
<P>His brother <HI>Aliaptu Abuzayd</HI> (or <HI>Mahumet ben Argon</HI>) by many attempts and shewes of valour purchased the restlesse Diadem: to whom, followed <HI>Hoharo-mirza,</HI> or <HI>Abusaid Bahador-chan anno</HI> 1337, who consumed his life in venerous exercises: so that for want of issue, the Kingdome became a Theater of many troubles, no lesse than 30 at one time contending for the Soveraignty: whereby the distressed people were compelled to look for help from home: And none more safe to trust to, than the Lord of <HI>Sa∣merchand, Tamberlayne,</HI> much famoused for his justice and victories, against the Sarmatique Tartar, <HI>Praecopense,</HI> and <HI>Chynaeses.</HI> Him they invocate by many presents of their love, and a letter fill'd with hideous complaints, describing their miseries, the confusion of their Kingdome, and insuffer∣able pride of the thirty competitors. The <HI>Scythic</HI> Emperour promises his best ayde, and with fifty thousand horse forthwith enters <HI>Persia,</HI> without doing any hurt, save against the Tyrants, all whom he persecuted with such fury, that in three moneths (by the industry of the Inhabitants) they are all taken and made to quaffe their farewell in the bitter cup of tormenting Death: for which, the people urged <HI>Tamberlayne</HI> to accept the Diadem, and to establish it by all meanes possible in his posterity. But after seven and twenty yeeres most honourable and succesfull government (in that time captivating the great Turk <HI>Bajazet,</HI> whom hee brought away in an iron Cage, subduing all <HI>Asia;</HI> yea, in eight yeares conquering more King∣domes and Provinces than the Romans did in eight hundred:) this Mo∣narch of the <HI>Asiatique</HI> world is subjected by imperious Death, &amp; intombed <HI>anno</HI> 1405, of the <HI>Heg.</HI> 785. at <HI>Anzar</HI> in <HI>Cathayo:</HI> leaving his sonnes and grand children to inherit his victories: <HI>Ioon-gwyr, Hameth-cheque, Myram∣sha,</HI> and <HI>Mirza-sharock,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Soutochio</HI> and <HI>Letrochio;</HI> of which, <HI>Ioon gwir</HI> died (three yeares before his father,) in <HI>Palestine,</HI> leaving two sonnes <HI>Mamet Sultan,</HI> and <HI>Pyr-Mahomet;</HI> which <HI>Pir Mahomet</HI> was by his Grandsire placed in <HI>Gaznehen</HI> and <HI>Industan,</HI> where he ruled till <HI>Pir Ally</HI> slew him villanously. <HI>Hameth Chec</HI> was slaine in <HI>Laurestan,</HI> some say in his fa∣thers

<P>This also is remarkable (the story of it is painted in <HI>Lohor</HI> palace) that king <HI>Badur</HI> thirsting after the conquest of <HI>Indya,</HI> disguises himselfe and thirty Noble men in his company in the habit of Kalenders or Friers, as if they were upon a Rummery or pilgrimage.

The shape is semilunary, like <HI>London:</HI> the streets long and narrow, and nasty; of seven miles continuance: in part 'tis wall'd about, the ditch the remainder, which too oft smels infectiously.

<P><HI>Radgee Rana</HI> the most potent and noble Prince of <HI>Indya,</HI> at this time lost his strong and stately Castle <HI>Chyttor,</HI> by treason of <HI>Zimet Padsha</HI> his substi∣tute, not content therewith, till he had made many inroades into <HI>Gujurat</HI> in contempt of the Moguls forces. <HI>Echar</HI> is glad of the occasion, hasting with fifty thousand horse to be revenged. Some months he spent in besie∣ging it, but so fruitlesly, that he attempts the conquest by stratagem, under∣mining the Fort, and to the admiration and terrour of the besieged, blowes it up with powder, causing such a breach as himselfe and twenty thousand men immediatly entred pel-mel with such haste &amp; fury, that <HI>Zimet</HI> the re∣bell perceiving treaty of no value, gathering in one his Family, consum'd himselfe and them in flames, to prevent the tortures provided for him by <HI>Ecbar,</HI> and <HI>Mardout</HI> his enraged Master. In this sort this famous Fort is ta∣ken, which <HI>Aladin</HI> by twelve yeares siege could doe no hurt to. A victory so great and valuable, that <HI>Eckbar</HI> causes it be exprest in sculpture, and for a Trophy placed in <HI>Agra</HI> as a wonder. Hee had no time to surfet of this victory, receiving letters from <HI>Rajea Bagwander</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Lahore,</HI> that <HI>Mirza Mamet Hagee</HI> his brother with thirty thousand horse out of <HI>Kabul,</HI> had attempted to prey upon <HI>Lahore: Ecbar</HI> delayes no time, but with his Army presents himselfe so suddenly to the Enemie, that without any re∣sistance or stay <HI>Mahomet</HI> flyes away, leaving his men and camp to the rage of <HI>Ecbars</HI> company.</P>
<P>This occasion drew the King to view all advantagious places of defence, which hee both bettered by his care, and gave them in charge to such hee trusted. He also takes a survay of <HI>Pang-Ob,</HI> out of which he is called by let∣ters from his mother in <HI>Agra,</HI> assuring him of the rebellion of <HI>Badur-kawn Ally-Kooli-Kawn</HI> and <HI>Zemaen,</HI> sent that spring against the <HI>Patanians,</HI> whom in <HI>Doab</HI> they put to flight, at <HI>Sambel</HI> also, and at <HI>Lachnoun</HI> got a greater vi∣ctory, and three weekes after, at <HI>Ioonpore</HI> utterly defeated them, subduing to the Mogul all such Provinces as lie ingirt 'twixt <HI>Ganges</HI> and <HI>Tsatsa,</HI> con∣quests of so great note, that they grew efflated beyond measure, conceiting all <HI>Indostan</HI> under like hazard, and which they resolved to make tryall of.

<P>Whiles things were in this sort digesting, newes comes to King <HI>Ecbar</HI> (then in <HI>Fettipore</HI>) that a great rebellion was begun in <HI>Gujurat</HI> by <HI>Ebra∣him Hossen, Mirza-cawn, Mahomet Hossen</HI> and <HI>Ioon-cawn,</HI> who had most audaciously forraged as farre as <HI>Baroch</HI> and were marching to <HI>Amadavad,</HI> hoping with his troopes of Theeves and Coolyes to make a prey of that Emperiall City.</P>

Yet, the Prince is not so simple, but that hee discovers his Fa∣thers subtilties, so that after three weekes vaine attempt to sack the Castle, he forsakes the Citie, and with twenty thousand horse moves back againe, with a full determination to bid <HI>Iangheer</HI> battell. It happened, that hee pitcht one night, where <HI>Mortosa-Kawn</HI> with six hundred horse (hearing of <HI>Gushrooes</HI> comming) was ambushed; without any parlee, <HI>Mortosa</HI> falls upon him, but such was the premeditated care <HI>Hussan</HI> had of the place and fight, that in two houres space their Enemies were shrewdly beaten, and <HI>Sha-Chelyal</HI> the Captaine slaine; so that had not <HI>Godgee Meleck</HI> with the Kings standard entred, proclaiming with great out-cries that the great Mogull was at hand, the Kings side had wholly perished: but of such terrour was the Kings approach (past <HI>Sultanpore</HI>) that <HI>Abdul Rajea</HI> the Princes Ensigne-bearer most basely threw it away and fled; and by his dastardly example all the Army, most of them being by the rustick time-serving people chast and knockt downe, and all the baggage seized on. The King in memory of this deliverance and victory erects there, at <HI>Tziekerry i.e.</HI> a place of hunting, a stately Castle, and new names the place (which I have formerly descri∣bed) <HI>Fettipore,</HI> that is, a Paradise. <HI>Fettipore,</HI> if the water had bin good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fettipore.</NOTE> by this time had triumphed over all the Cities in <HI>Indya:</HI> 'tis wall'd about, and to the N.N.W. discovers a lake or fish-pond five miles over. The N.E. has a faire Buzzar five hundred paces long, and well paved, built on all sides with pleasant Mansions: at one end is the Moguls house, and a <HI>Mohol</HI> most excellently framed: the other side is glorious in a Mosque ascended by thirty steps barr'd with a brave gate, in all so observable, that it is scarce equall'd throughout <HI>Indya:</HI> the top is full of Piramyds, the court within six times bigger than the <HI>Royall Exchange</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> singularly paved with free stone, the Iles are large and paved, the columns of one stone high &amp; beau∣tifull, and affronting this gate is a most sumptuous Monument, covered with paint and Oyster pearle shells, proud in the Kalender there buried. The miserable Prince (accompanied with <HI>Hassenbeg, Abdul-Radgee,</HI> and <HI>Chan Badashaw</HI>) scarce lookes behind him till they attaine <HI>Lahore,</HI> where <HI>Radgee</HI> stayes; but <HI>Sultan Gushroo</HI> with <HI>Badasha</HI> crosse the <HI>Ravee,</HI> and labour

to arrive with safety at <HI>Rantas</HI> a Castle inexpugnable: but bad fortune fol∣lowes them; for, passing the river <HI>Tzenob,</HI> by the trecherous watermen they are brought into the power of <HI>Cassem-chawns</HI> sonnes (then besieging the Castle) who without delay &amp; mercy speedily convay them to <HI>Iangheer,</HI> by that time past <HI>Latir</HI> a floud seven dayes travell thence. The King overjoyed with this good hap, returns to <HI>Lahore,</HI> and by the way puts to death many Vmbraves the Princes followers. The Prince was committed to the cu∣stody of <HI>Zemanaebeg</HI> (called after, <HI>Mahobet-chan, i. e.</HI> beloved Lord;) <HI>Hassenbeg, Bedasha,</HI> and <HI>Abdul Radgee</HI> are first publiquely disgrac't, and then imprisoned.</P>
<P>Whether some Noblemen reputed <HI>Iangheer</HI> tyrannicall, or that they thought <HI>Gushroo</HI> had better title to the Empire, or that meere envie caused it, is uncertaine; but one of these so wrought, that one night some prime men of quality watching the Prince, agreed upon a conspiracie to take away the Mogulls life upon the high mountaines as he passed to <HI>Cabul,</HI> and to place <HI>Gushroo</HI> in his roome; the Traytors were <HI>Mirza Cherieff</HI> (brother of <HI>Assaph chan</HI>) <HI>Mirza Mouradyn</HI> his Cozen, <HI>Mirza Petulla, Mirza Shaf∣fenbeg, Hollabeg,</HI> and <HI>Murdoph-chan. Iangheer</HI> suspecting no treachery pas∣ses on, but by good fortune is so attended, that they could by no meanes effect their villany. In the interim, <HI>Ethaman Doulet</HI> the Treasurer is ac∣cus'd by one of his slaves to have converted to his owne use, and for th'in∣couragement of Traytors, 500000 roopees out of the Mogulls Trea∣sury; that, and the newes of <HI>Cheer Affenchan (Ethaman Doulets</HI> sonne in law) his trecherous murther of <HI>Cotopdy Mamet-chan Goga</HI> (Liefetenant of <HI>Bengala</HI> neere <HI>Radgee Mahal,</HI> (albeit <HI>Affenchann</HI> the Turk therefore was al∣so slaine by <HI>Gessadine</HI> and <HI>Kisswer-Chawn,</HI> brother and sonne to the Liefete∣nant, his Mother and Wife most basely abused) yet these reflected so much upon <HI>Doulet,</HI> that he is not only put from his place, but also his estate con∣fiscated and himselfe in <HI>Dianet-Chans</HI> house, to his owne great griefe and the astonishment of all <HI>Industan,</HI> imprisoned.</P>
<P>But greater was <HI>Iangheers</HI> feare and choler, when by the open and reso∣lute defiance of <HI>Godgee Vehes</HI> hee is acquainted with the late named conspi∣racie, by men of power, such as he never injured, and as had relation to be neere him in all occasions; he is much confounded at it, but by <HI>Myrza Vm∣braves</HI> advice, throwes off all abject feare, and without more dispute or delay commands them all to execution, onely <HI>Ethaman Danlet</HI> at the re∣quest of his Keeper is pardoned (upon promise of 200000 roopees to the King and him for his life) but led back to prison most disgracefully. After which, he returnes (from <HI>Cabul</HI>) unto <HI>Lahore,</HI> and in the way remembring the danger he had escaped, and that <HI>Gushroo</HI> his sonne was partly causer, he commands his sonnes eyes by juice of Aeck to be forsetted, but the poy∣son is more mercifull, leaving one eye a little illuminated. <HI>Chan Asem</HI> also (<HI>Gushroo's</HI> Father in law) is clad in loathsome raggs and brought into the <HI>Guzelchan,</HI> where every Vmbrave is commanded to spet in his beard and face, is then fetterd, manacled, and led to prison, where two full yeares he remained, till by mediation of his wives he is delivered.</P>

The Jesuits named them <HI>Philippo, Carlo,</HI> and <HI>Henrico:</HI> most men thought them undone, but God knows they were bettered. That yeare also they baptised another Grandson of <HI>Ecbars</HI> by name of <HI>Don Edoard.</HI> This yeare 1019. and of our account 1609. <HI>Mirza Ombrave</HI> became apoplectique, and made incapable of his office: <HI>T'zalam-chan</HI> also in <HI>Cotopdy's</HI> place is made Viceroy of <HI>Bengala,</HI> and commanded to send up as prisoners, <HI>Affen-chans</HI> family; which hee did accordingly. In the way, the young Widdow <HI>Meher-Metzia</HI> (<HI>Daulets</HI> daughter and sister to <HI>Asseph-chan</HI>) was affronted by a Wizard who told her many stories of her insuing greatnesse, which after hapned: for they were no sooner arriv'd at <HI>Agray</HI> (whither <HI>Iangheer</HI> was also come) but are most kindly welcomed by <HI>Rockya Sultanna</HI> the mother Queene: and, one day being led into the Mahal with her little Girle, <HI>Iangheer</HI> accidentally lifts up her vayle, and discovers so rare and forceable a beauty, that thenceforward she is the sum of all he contemplates: hee studies now how to advance <HI>Doulet</HI> her de∣jected Father, the better to ingratiate himselfe into the affection of his faire Goddesse; hee forgets his state, and privatly each eve passes by boat to <HI>Ethaman Doulets</HI> house, and all night consumes himselfe and pretious time in wanton lookes and amorous dalliances: but to enjoy her everlastingly, at length commands <HI>Godzee Abdul Hossen</HI> to request <HI>Dawlets</HI> good will in his daughter, for hee meant to marry her; <HI>Hossen</HI> admires it, and layes be∣fore him the indignity he offers so great a Majesty; but <HI>Iangheer</HI> (now <HI>Cu∣pids</HI> slave) is deafe and blind; in choller bids him goe, or stay eternally. He speeds away and uses small perswasions: for <HI>Ethaman Dawlet</HI> (by this mi∣racle rapt from his discontented Orbe) after some profession of his base∣nesse, condiscends: and <HI>Meher Metsya</HI> is forthwith espoused with all solem∣nity, her name changed into <HI>Noursha begem</HI> (or <HI>Nor-mahal</HI>) <HI>i.e.</HI> light or glory of the Court, her Father is advanced above all other Umbraves, her brother <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> and most of her generation with th'addition of honors, wealth, or command exceedingly graced and established: and in this sun-shine of happinesse and content <HI>Iangheer</HI> spends some yeares without regarding ought save <HI>Cupids</HI> Currantoes.</P>

<P><HI>Cawn-Iehan</HI> (during these broiles) wayting all occasions of conquest in <HI>Decan,</HI> by discord and envie of some Umbraves in the Army, finds his suc∣cesse worse and worse against <HI>Melec Amber.</HI> He knowes no remedy with∣out acquainting the Mogull, and entreating one of his sonnes to come thi∣ther, by whose greatnesse the Army might be better ordered. After some consideration, he sends <HI>Sultan Perwees</HI> and <HI>Radjea Ramdas</HI> who from <HI>Bram∣pore</HI> sends <HI>Chan Iehan, Radgee Ramdas,</HI> and <HI>Mansingh</HI> with an Army to <HI>Ballagate,</HI> where they send defiance to <HI>Melec,</HI> and ere long expect him: but <HI>Iangheer</HI> fearing the forces of <HI>Decan</HI> speeds <HI>Chan Asem</HI> with foure thou∣sand men more, and removes his Lescar to <HI>Asmeer,</HI> a place convenient for hunting: <HI>Chan Asem</HI> is no sooner come to <HI>Brampore,</HI> but entreats <HI>Ganganna</HI> (Lieutenant of <HI>Khoor</HI>) to joyne with him, and so hastens towards <HI>Bellagu∣ate,</HI> then in all 100000 men, 600 Elephants, and 12000 Camells, yea of such fame, grew this expedition, that ere they departed <HI>Cuncam</HI> they were 600000. With these huge Troops, <HI>Abdul-chan</HI> penetrates into the heart of <HI>Decan:</HI> no resistance is made by men in field, Towns, or Cittadells, so that in <HI>Beder, Aurdenagar, Gentfro</HI> and as farre as <HI>Kerchy</HI> (the seat Royall) they marcht victoriously; burning, spoiling, and imprisoning; Villages, Temples, and Inhabitants not to be counted. The <HI>Decan</HI> King (struck with feare &amp; astonisht at their numbers) flies too and fro, nor resting any where, till he came to <HI>Daultabat,</HI> (ten miles from <HI>Kerky</HI>) a Castle reputed im∣pregnable.

<P><PB N="80" REF="46"/><HI>Iangheer</HI> is over joyed with so much good Fortune; and (to relish it the better) solaces himselfe in his sonne <HI>Perwees</HI> Gardens beyond the river. <HI>Ethaman Dowlet</HI> (Queene <HI>Normals</HI> Father) dyed at that time; his great estate is by the King given to his daughter and <HI>Assaph-cawn,</HI> but his Office is confer'd upon <HI>Godgee Abdul Hossen. Curroon</HI> also (who sate as Em∣perour in his owne ambition) with a greedy eye respects the Diadem; but perceives his imprisoned Brother interposing in the way: but such is the violence and magicke of pride and tyranny, that it runs on not caring how, though masqued with never so much deformity: he feignes himselfe sick; (his disease is horrible) nothing can recover him save his eldest Bro∣thers death; <HI>Ganganna</HI> is of his infernall councell, who applauds his hu∣mour, and promises his recovery; he presently acquaints some <HI>Mancebdars</HI> in the exployt, of all which rascall troope <HI>Reza</HI> (or <HI>Rajea Bandor</HI>) a very villain, is quickest of apprehension and least scrupulous; <HI>Curroon</HI> (as if he knew nothing) is conveighed out of <HI>Brampore</HI> to better his health; whiles that incarnate Divell at an unseasonable houre in the night knocks at <HI>Gou∣shroo's</HI> chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.D.</HI> 1620. <HI>A. heg.</HI> 1000.</NOTE> who (as awakened out of a fearfull dream) starts up and de∣mands his errant; the villain replyes, he came from the <HI>Mogul</HI> his Father, with order for his delivery. The miserable Prince (affrighted with his Ravens voyce, and suspecting treason) desires him to stay till the morne: the villain (without further parlee, perceiving no entrance by entreaty) breaks open his doore, grapples with the amazed Prince, gets him downe and strangles him: that done, he layes him in his bed, locks the doore, and trots away as if the Prince dyed of some imposthume, and hee had done nothing. <HI>Curroon</HI> has quick newes of his Brothers death, and in∣wardly rejoyces; but ere Sun-rise, his afflicted wife (<HI>Cawn Azems</HI> daugh∣ter) goes to visit him; where finding him speechlesse, and (by his contus'd face) murdered; never did poore wretch shed more teares, or shew more passion; by tearing her faire hayre, deforming her sweet face so fiercely, so amazedly, that her Father and all his family heare her, and see it to their griefe and admiration. But when they see the cause also, they wonder not, none of them forbearing to expresse their sorrow after severall modes, without moderation. All <HI>Brampore</HI> rings of this Treason, suspects the author, and curses him; but <HI>Curroon,</HI> (cloath'd with deceipt) comes thither, falls upon the corps, and expresses so much sorrow, that many durst have sworne that he was innocent. After two dayes ceremony, they bury him, and <HI>Curroon</HI> writes his Father word of his brothers sudden death (concealing the occasion.) <HI>Iangheer</HI> weeps, and afterwards growes mad with rage, suspecting some violence; but not knowing upon the sud∣den how to discover it, he feeds upon melancholy and discontent, writes back a letter of reproofe and threats to <HI>Curroon</HI> and his Umbraves, swea∣ring revenge when they least suspected it; commands the body to be digd up, and brought with solemne state to <HI>Elabasse,</HI> where hee interres him in his Mothers monument; sends for <HI>Chan Asem</HI> and his afflicted daughter, comforts them, and takes them for his constant companions; to <HI>Sultan Bullochy</HI> or <HI>B'lochy</HI> his grandson (sonne to Prince <HI>Gushrooe</HI>) he intailes the Imperiall Crowne, gives him the command of ten thousand horse, and by <HI>Chan Asem</HI> his Grandsire (of the blood royall of <HI>Tartary</HI>) to be educated.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="46"/><HI>Curroon,</HI> by his Fathers love to <HI>Sultan Bullochy,</HI> perceives himselfe dis∣regarded, and thenceforth (not caring to please him) flies out into rebel∣lion. And <HI>Abdul-chan</HI> (winding his aymes) without leave taking, forsakes the Army and packs to <HI>Kalpi</HI> to his government, but by the Mogull (who was still desirous to continue the <HI>Decan</HI> warres) is rebuked and made to re∣turne. Yet ere long he is revoked, for at that time <HI>Abbas</HI> King of <HI>Persia</HI> with 30000 men besieges <HI>Kandahor,</HI> pretending it a member of his Em∣pire. The Citie was defended by <HI>Azief-chan,</HI> a Captaine of great valour and honesty, who for sixteene dayes kept it in despight of the Persian, but perceiving his Company too weake if they entred, hee writes to <HI>Iangheer,</HI> desiring speedy assistance.</P>
<P><HI>Iangheer</HI> is neerely touched with his distresse, and promises him imme∣diate succour; so that, posting to <HI>Lahore,</HI> he convocates his Vmbraves for advice and help, and first, commands <HI>Chan Iehan</HI> (then Liefetenant of <HI>Mul∣than,</HI> adjoyning <HI>Kandahar</HI>) with such force as he had in readinesse to haste thither, the Enemy in the interim attempting day and night the entrance, whiles <HI>Iangheer</HI> the great Mogull, ruminates whom to make his Generall; at last, by his owne assent and choise of all his Vmbraves, hee fixes upon <HI>Abdul-chan,</HI> by that, by <HI>Curroons</HI> leave againe returned. This famous Cap∣taine readily accepts the charge, speeds to <HI>Lahore,</HI> and is imbraced with such sudden joy by the Mogull, that hee presently contracts his faire grand daughter (<HI>D'haen Shaws</HI> child) to <HI>Mirza-chawn, Abdul-chawns</HI> eldest sonne, and so with fifteene thousand choise Cavalry, and one hundred Elephants, (five thousand of which hee himselfe brought with him) makes haste to give battell to the victorious Persian. But ere hee could attaine thither, <HI>Iangheer</HI> (having notice that the Persians were too strong to be beaten, and had vowed the conquest) by letters commands <HI>Azief-chan</HI> to surrender it unto the Enemy, but he, doubting they were counterfeit, holds out, till by a Mine, a great part of the wall is blown up, and <HI>Abbas</HI> is entring; which when <HI>Azieph-chan</HI> saw, hee mediates their yeelding it up, upon condition they might depart safely with their baggage. <HI>Abbas</HI> (who onely aymed at the Citie) condiscends, has it given him, wherein hee places <HI>Ally-Koli-cawn</HI> and returnes to <HI>Spahawn,</HI> whiles <HI>Assuph</HI> and <HI>Abdul-chan</HI> easily goe back to <HI>Lahore,</HI> where with welcome, by <HI>Iangheer</HI> they are entertained.</P>
<P>CANDAHOR has Artick elevation foure and thirty degrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Candahor.</NOTE> and longi∣tude from the first Meridian 98 degrees. The Province (South) is reasonable fruitfull, and redundant in all good things, yet by reason of so many Car∣ravans passing, and repassing from <HI>Lahore</HI> to <HI>Persia,</HI> all sort of provision is very deere, and the passage (in regard of many rascall troopes of <HI>Puttans, Agwans</HI> and <HI>Coolyes,</HI> which like the inhospitable Arabs prey upon all <HI>Caffi∣laes</HI>) chargeable and dangerous. The Citie is not very spatious, but strong; made defensive by many helps of nature and industry; to the South and East it is surrounded with an advantagious wall, to the West and North with high and precipitious mountaines. The Suburbs also (tho not well defended) are large, adding to the Citty, beauty and wealth; nothing want∣ing save good water, which there &amp; all the way to <HI>Spahawn</HI> is brackish, and the earth for most part barren and uncomfortable.</P>
<P><HI>Iangheer,</HI> by the crafty perswasion of <HI>Assaph-chawn,</HI> sends him with pe∣remptory

command to the Castle-keeper of <HI>Agra,</HI> that without delay hee should transferre the treasure thence to <HI>Lahore,</HI> where hee then was (and resol'd to be of long time) abiding. It was a message of much wonder to <HI>Ethamat-chan,</HI> considering the strength where it was kept, his owne ho∣nesty, the danger of convaying so great a masse of gold and silver, a journey so long, so chargeable, and dangerous. These and many other perswasions hee used to <HI>Assaph kawn,</HI> but in vaine, had they beene trebled. So that on the one side, haste, threats, and the Mogulls command is urged; on the other, delay, disswasions, and diverting <HI>Iangheers</HI> meaning to another sense is objected on either part so violently, that from words, blowes became their uncivill moderatours. But in that exercise <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> (for all his greatnesse) found himselfe weakest, finding the Eunuchs Guard so strong, and <HI>Ethabar-chan</HI> Provost of <HI>Agray</HI> to second him: so that, he craves their pardon, and after some toyle, by many dissimulations at length wins them to his purpose. But, whiles the Eunuchs are preparing for the journey, this deceitfull man with all speed posts away a swift Zantell (or Footman) to his sonne in law <HI>Curroon</HI> (then upon the confines of <HI>Decan</HI>) advising his speed, and to ambush 'twixt <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Delly</HI> for his Fathers Treasure.

<PB N="83" REF="47"/>
unloads the Camels of their pretious burthens, convaies it in again, fortifies the Castle, and sends quickly to <HI>Iangheer</HI> of his sonnes trayterous intenti∣on, who is astonisht above measure, and presently sends every way for assi∣stance, to <HI>Sultan Perwees</HI> out of <HI>Pathan,</HI> to <HI>Chan-Iehan</HI> out of <HI>Multhan,</HI> and for <HI>Mahobet-chan</HI> out of <HI>Kabull;</HI> whiles <HI>Curroon</HI> (perceiving he was discove∣red) with his whole Army divided amongst severall Captaines, <HI>Ganganna, Rustan-chan, Radgee Bickermanse, Mirza-Darab, Sayet-chan, Mahomet Tack∣jeck, Tsossally,</HI> &amp;c. shew themselves in front of <HI>Agray,</HI> making a bravado, as if the conquest were easie and no way doubled of. But the two Eunuchs keepe close in their defended Sconces, whiles <HI>Radgee Bickermanse</HI> at <HI>Cur∣roons</HI> intreaty, begins the churlish play, followed by <HI>Byrambeg, Rustanchan, Wazir-chan</HI> and <HI>Darab,</HI> whose onset tho it was full of gallant force and fury, yet <HI>Ethabar-Chan,</HI> desirous to sacrifice his best endeavours to expresse his loyalty retaliates such entertainment, that after three houres triall, having lost five hundred men, without any prevailing they retreat, well beaten and ashamed; so that (converting their power upon a more hopefull way) they draw back and fall a rifling the houses of such Vmbraves as were like∣ly to have booty. <HI>Byrambeg</HI> begins with the house of <HI>Mirza Abdull, Chan Azems</HI> sonne, but finds such hot and unexpected welcome that hee was forc't out, not without amazement. Howbeit, <HI>Radgee Bickermanse</HI> entred with better fortune <HI>Assaph-chans</HI> (which in this tumult found no excep∣tion) out of which they drew twenty leck of roopees; <HI>Rustan-chan</HI> out of <HI>Lascar-chans</HI> 16 leck, and <HI>Darab</HI> from <HI>Nouradyn Cooly's,</HI> ten; In all, about threescore leck of roopees, after which base theft, (as if they had done wonders) with great triumph they returned to <HI>Fettipore.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Curroon,</HI> after three weekes stay about <HI>Fettipore;</HI> finding it impossible by force or subtilty to obtain the treasure, and no more prey in those parts, resolves to march back and give his Father battell, whom hee heard (from <HI>Assaph-chawn</HI>) was comming. To which end, after double allowance to each souldier, and protestations of his kind remembrances, hee retreats to∣wards <HI>Delly,</HI> in five dayes attaining <HI>Pherrybaud</HI> ten course from <HI>Delly,</HI> at such time as <HI>Iangheer</HI> with his Army pitcht three course from the Towne, and seven from <HI>Curroons</HI> trenches.</P>
<P>Very early next morne, <HI>Curroon</HI> (longing to graspe the Diadem) com∣mands <HI>Radgee Byckermanse</HI> to begin the fight with eight thousand horse, against whom, <HI>Iangheer</HI> the great Mogull opposes <HI>Mahobet-chan, Abdul-Chan, Ethabar chan, Assaph-cawn, Godgee Abdel Hussan, Zadoc-chan, Immirza Mamet, Radgee Bertsingh, Tzeer-chan, Seberdeest-chan,</HI> and other principall Vmbraves; by advice of <HI>Mahobet-chan</HI> dividing the whole Army into three. One part to himselfe and <HI>Radgee Bertsingh,</HI> a second to <HI>Sultan Sheryar</HI> his yongest sonne and <HI>Mahomet-chan,</HI> the third to <HI>Abdul-chan</HI> and <HI>Zadoc-chawn:</HI> to all whom hee used many perswasions to fight bravely and with discre∣tion, as against exquisite warriours, most of which had beene in many con∣flicts; yet such was the justice of the cause, &amp; each mans particular interest, that he knew they needed no exasperating. Then to each Commander (as they were entring combat) he sent some small token of his zeale, as re∣membrances of his love and ingagements upon his victory of great prefer∣ment: <HI>Zaber-deest-chan</HI> in the first place (carrying <HI>Abdulchan</HI> his Masters

present) by mischance falls among five hundred light horse of <HI>Curroons</HI> and perishes. <HI>Bickermanse</HI> with his large troop of horse, charges <HI>Bertsingh</HI> and the <HI>Moguls</HI> quarter so furiously, that many parted with their lives to expresse their loyalty. Whiles <HI>Ganganna</HI> and <HI>Curroon</HI> enter pelmell a∣gainst <HI>Mahobet-cawn,</HI> and <HI>Rustan-cawn</HI> with <HI>T'sossally</HI> upon <HI>Abdul-cawn,</HI> all which were Captaines of such valour and experience, and the armies on either side so irritate for honour and benefit, that for three houres the battell continued with rage, each part fighting so bravely, that no advan∣tage could be discovered, till victory at last inclines to <HI>Curroon,</HI> when <HI>Rad∣jea Byckermanse</HI> after a terrible slaughter of the <HI>Moguls</HI> squadron, in des∣pight of his guard, enters sternly (dyde in blood) <HI>Iangheers</HI> royall Tent, and arrested him as his prisoner, but he had scarcely meditated the greatnesse and excellency of his prize, when grim death directs the battle axe of a Mancebdar then in presence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Radjea Bic∣kermanse <HI>slaine,</HI></NOTE> which fell so sore, so sure, that downe hee fell, with a curse breathing out his unwilling soule, and such terror into the hearts of his followers, that without any remembrance of their con∣quest, they all fled, and gave the <HI>Moguls</HI> part fresh advantage to re-inforce the victory.</P>
<P><HI>Curroon</HI> amazedly perceives upon the sudden his overthrow, and by and by has the reason of it. He does all hee can to alter their cowardize; he perswades, threats, opposes, and cries aloud that he was living, yea a hundred Captaines as good as <HI>Byckermanse</HI> were in the Army: but in vaine, for such was their preposterous feare and disorder, that he sees it impossi∣ble to revoke them: so that (vollying one a thousand curses, expressing all symptomes of rage and frenzie) he rides to and fro, not knowing whi∣ther he had better here put a period (by his death) to all future misfor∣tune, or to fly and hope for better afterwards: at last, by <HI>Ganganna's</HI> advice he hasts away, but leaves his men and treasure to the mercy of his enemies, and after long and swift flight with few of his freinds, attaines the desolate and high Mountaines of <HI>Mewat,</HI> in whose solitary rocks hee ruminates his misery and the justice of God upon his high rebellion.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Perwees</HI> with a glad heart meets his victorious Father at <HI>Balzol;</HI> after which the Seralios are freed, and the Castle gates opened, as fearlesse of any more opposall. And now, the old <HI>Mogul</HI> cheeres up his late droo∣ping spirits, and solaces himselfe with <HI>Noormal,</HI> the light of his eyes, and the best object of his devotion: his delight and jocundities gave a faire occasion to <HI>Assaph-cawn,</HI> and <HI>Ganganna,</HI> to mediate a reconciliation for <HI>Curroon;</HI> and which the old man also inclined to; so that; from <HI>Asmeer,</HI> letters of peace and pardon are dispacht unto the rebellious Prince; who reads them with no small joy, and prepares for his submission: with <HI>Ganganna, Abdul cawn, Darab cawn, Beyram beg,</HI> and other Umbraves of quality, hee descends the Mountaines of <HI>Mewat,</HI> and through <HI>Bassawer, Hambyer</HI> and <HI>Lael-sod</HI> (unable to forbeare piltring all the way) at last hee came to <HI>Azmeer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Curroon</HI> it pardoned, but rebells afresh.</NOTE> where he throws himselfe at's Fathers feet, and upon his repentance and oath never more to fly out, is pardoned: but his submis∣sion (as by the sequell) appeared counterfeit, and upon this occasion.</P>
<P>So soone as <HI>Rajea Bickermanse</HI> was slaine, <HI>Curroon</HI> in his place made <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> Governor of <HI>Gusurat, Amadavad</HI> and <HI>Cambaya. Abdul-cawn,</HI>

though glad of so high preferment delays his journey; both in regard of his desire to see <HI>Curroon</HI> freed from his troubles, and to enjoy the command and gain he every day got in <HI>Curroons</HI> depredations: and obteyning leave to stay a while, he sends his Eunuch <HI>Baffadur-cawn</HI> as his deputy to repre∣sent his person, and to prepare things the better against his comming. The Eunuch in good equipage travels thither-ward, and by the inhabitants of <HI>Amadabat</HI> is received with much state and ceremonie; but, beholding himselfe mounted so high, incircled with such rayes of Majesty, &amp; roabed with so much honour, his former vassalage is forgotten, and his genius so transcendently efflated with pride and ambition, that he beholds his equals with disdaine and anger, his inferiors with a squint and supercilious eye of scorne and tyranny: yet, such as knew his feathers were but borrowed, and that his glory was but the reflect of him hee counterfeited, gave him occasion to understand himselfe, by affronts, neglect and undervaluing him; especially <HI>Nadab-Tsaffi-chan</HI> the <HI>Moguls</HI> Chancellor, who by intrea∣ty and threats sought to reforme him, but by such meanes more exaspe∣rated; so that after many base and contumelious usages, hee is forced (to save his life) out of the City, but so inraged, that he vowes requitall: hee hasts to <HI>Nazar-cawn</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Patan</HI> and <HI>Baban-cawn</HI> of <HI>Chapperbenniz,</HI> whom by his complaints (and affront offered as he pretended to the <HI>Mogul</HI> their Master) hee inflames with fury; by this advantage also perceiving a way to defy <HI>Curroon</HI> their inveterate adversary: for hearing the Eunuch had not above five hundred horse, they presently prepare, and advance to <HI>Amadavad</HI> with a thousand horse and five Elephants, and (by leave of some that hated the Eunuch) enter the Cicy, and commit what villany they please, force the Castle, and imprison <HI>Baffador-cawn</HI> the Eunuch, with his branded associates <HI>Mirza Madary, Motzab-cawn</HI> and <HI>Mamet-Hassen</HI> the Cambayan Podestate, whom they disgrace, and depart at pleasure, lea∣ving the City satisfied, and the Country full of amazement. But ere long, <HI>Curroon</HI> has notice of it, and (finding it a plot to dishonour him) swells with rage, thunders out his discontent, and straight way breaks out into rebellion. But <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> scoffes at this accident, as unworthy <HI>Cur∣roons</HI> impatience and his trouble, their Antagonists being but three, one of them a pallid Lawyer; the other two, Merchants of small wealth or reputation.</P>
<P>Yet knowing satisfaction would not be had without a combat, and that <HI>Saffi-cawn</HI> might not too long feed upon their misery, hee convocates all his Umbraves, <HI>Amet-cawn,</HI> (Governour of <HI>Brodera</HI>) <HI>T'zalibeg, Rustan Ba∣dor, Mamet-hossen, Mercon-beg, Zerdzie-cawn, Matzael-cawn</HI> and others; to each of whom he relates the Princes dishonour and his owne griefe, not that hee feared such meane enemies, but that herein hee saw the fire of more wrath and discord a kindling; which by the constancy and valour of these his friends hee doubted not to extinguish. They heare him, un∣derstand, and professe their loyalty: yea unanimously with seven thou∣sand choyce horse make haste to chastise <HI>Saffi-chan</HI> &amp; his associates: foure∣teene hundred thousand roopees are disburst by <HI>Abdul-cawn,</HI> to increase his army with ten thousand infantery; so that now hee makes sure to pu∣nish, yea to extirpate the very memory of his enemies: indeed, many

swell themselves with empty conceits and fancies, and by a foolish admi∣ration of their own power and bravery, judge all attempts, though chargd with never so much danger, inferiour to their worth and fortune; but tne event oftentimes discovers their shallow imaginations, and makes them ridiculous. We see it so in this <HI>Abdul-cawn,</HI> a man of great power, credit, and experience; yet at this time so whirld, yea so efflated with pride and scorne, that (by too much security and contempt of those hee was to grapple with) hee prepares his owne ruine. From <HI>Mandou</HI> with his Army, in five dayes hee comes to <HI>Brodera,</HI> and hasts thence to <HI>Wasset,</HI> judging all <HI>Gujurat</HI> affrighted at his comming; but <HI>Saffi-cawn</HI> and his were nothing troubled at it; no, although <HI>Sultan-Bullochy</HI> and <HI>Cawn-Azem</HI> were then at <HI>Tseroy</HI> a good way distant, nor that he wanted (the nerves of war) mony, and the people were (though his was the <HI>Moguls</HI> cause) neutrall and indifferent; but rather, inspir'd with new courage and pollicy, throwes off all apparition of feare, and (to adde somewhat to his treasury and pay) forrages such Townes as refused to contribute, forces the Exchequer, and spoyles that rich and glorious throne or state, <HI>Sultan Curroon</HI> had late∣ly set up in <HI>Amadavad,</HI> as an addition and monument of his glory; with this and his other helps he entertaines an Army of twenty thousand horse, five hundred Musketiers, thirty Elephants for warre; and (by Proclama∣tion, that all his provision was in defence of <HI>Iangheers</HI> prerogatives) above twenty Umbraves of quality, <HI>Mirza Cassen, Immirza Mockym, Radgea Cal∣licawn, Radgee Doola, Commel-cawn, Gokeldas, Phereez-cawn, Tzedchan, Tzed Iacob</HI> &amp;c. associate him, to <HI>Kanckry,</HI> where hee incampt, and thence to <HI>Assempore;</HI> where hearing of <HI>Abdul-cawns</HI> comming, hee arose and came to <HI>Boubentalow,</HI> six course from <HI>Amadavad;</HI> where in a valiant posture, hee attended the comming of his enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> at <HI>Anamogery</HI> receives intelligence of their incamping; in scornfull sort he tels the messenger he was comming, and upon his owne company lookes so merrily that they all condemn'd him of too much con∣fidence, but (loath he should perceive any want of valour in them) they equall his haste, and couragiously march to <HI>Nyriaed,</HI> and so to <HI>Momodabad,</HI> but six course from the Enemy: there, <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> by assent of his other Vmbraves command <HI>Motzab-cawn</HI> to prison, and shackles him; (upon some intelligence passing twixt him and <HI>Saffin-cawn</HI> his enemy) and next day with his sonne <HI>Godgee Sultan</HI> upon an Elephant are sent to <HI>Mando</HI> to receive their tryall. The ensuing morne hee moves towards <HI>Kavise</HI> and there hearing how strong the Enemy was (his opinion somewhat altered) he travels to <HI>Baroch</HI> thinking to assaile them in the reare, but in vaine, for they discovered him; so that next day he resolved to encounter them in a maine battell, and accordingly at that time divides his Army into three; one, to <HI>Amet-cawn</HI> and <HI>Tzalibeg;</HI> another to <HI>Tzardi-cawn, Maxatbeg</HI> and <HI>Mamet-Cooly;</HI> and the last to himselfe: and in this equipage, the whole Camp removed to <HI>Zietelpore</HI> and <HI>Phettibeg;</HI> where <HI>Nahar-cawn,</HI> his five sonnes, and two sonnes in law, <HI>Karamamet-cawn</HI> and <HI>Kamamet-cawn,</HI> with three thousand horse, begin the fight, and charge so hotly upon <HI>Abdul-cawns</HI> troops, that they made them retire and lose their ground of advan∣tage; besides, they playd so fiercely on them with their Muskets, that
<PB N="87" REF="49"/>
they disordered <HI>Abdul-cawns</HI> best cavalry, and by wounding their best Ele∣phant, forced him to turne and execute his wrath upon his own company.</P>
<P><HI>Curroons</HI> chiefe Captaine sees the perill, and knowes no way for pre∣vention, save by a challenge to a single combat with <HI>Nahar-cawn</HI> that was so valiant. The old man is so full of heat and fury that he accepts it, and with his Lance carreers so bravely, that <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> smarts in the Arme; but the old man wounded in the head had perished, had not his sonnes then made proofe of their utmost valour and obedience: howbeit by this expression; three of them wel-nigh sacrific'd their lives, not sorry if they had terminated in so happie an occasion; but <HI>Kamamet</HI> was slaine, and the residue so discouraged, that but for <HI>Delawer-cawn</HI> (who reanima∣ted them) they had fled and left <HI>Abdul</HI> victorious.</P>
<P>Whiles these were bandying for glory in the field of Mars, <HI>Tzed-cawn</HI> and <HI>T'zed-Iacup</HI> give a brave charge upon <HI>Tzalibeg</HI> and <HI>Amet-cawn;</HI> where after mutuall giving and receiving blowes <HI>Tzalibeg</HI> descends first a degree of misery by being unhorst by his adversaries Elephant, and by <HI>Tzed-cawn</HI> forc't to a deadly dormitorie. <HI>Amet-cawn</HI> (also adventring further than discretion warranted) is taken by <HI>Radjea Doola</HI> and beheaded: so is <HI>Tzalibeg,</HI> and both, sent to <HI>Saffinchan</HI> as a reall trophy and testimoniall of their victory. The death of these great men so afflicted the whole Armie, (that throwing away all hopes of conquest) each man fled which way his fancie directed him, <HI>Tzaitsi-chan</HI> Governour of <HI>Brodera</HI> excepted, who thought it too great a blemish to his honour to turne taile, having five hundred horse and three Elephants as yet lusty and couragious; but what could his opppsition do? when <HI>Saffin-cawn</HI> in person with his victori∣ous troops affronted him; to contend were madnesse, and therefore up∣on intreatie, yeelds, and has faire quarter gives him; but his example could work but little with <HI>Ma'met-Cooly</HI> his sonne, for hee (imagining his Father had done cowardly) with forty horse and one Elephant flies to <HI>Ab∣dul-cawn,</HI> who received little joy in such an untimely expression, being burthened with sorrow and disgrace, but bids him (do as he did) flie, to avoyd the swift rage and pursuit of the Enemy. In the flight, <HI>Motsaib-cawn</HI> is brought back to <HI>Saffin-cawn,</HI> and <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> (by unexpected on∣sets of the <HI>Coolies</HI> and high-way roagues, as also by intollerable tempests, amazed, beaten, and discouraged) hastens to <HI>Baroch;</HI> next day to <HI>Surrat;</HI> and after eight daies refreshment, and some fresh companie, to <HI>Brampore;</HI> to attend <HI>Curroons</HI> command, and make provision for reparation of his honour, never till then so notoriously blemished.</P>

<HI>Curroon</HI> was travelled. They give <HI>Iangheer</HI> notice of their good fortune, and hee celebrates it with no lesse joy, than as if hee had triumpht over a dangerous enemy. But behold, this faire Sun-shine of content is inve∣loped with an unexpected cloud of storme and danger. <HI>I'hen Thouz</HI> an <HI>Ouzbeg</HI> Tartar (of long time watching some fit occasion to forrage the <HI>Moguls</HI> Territories, by <HI>Curroons</HI> unquietnesse spies it,) with thirty thou∣sand horse overruns <HI>Chabul,</HI> perpetrating all sorts of spoyle and mischefe. <HI>Iangheer,</HI> exclaimes and rages violently, but so soone as hee had given vent to this his swelling passion, he sends post to <HI>Zaed-cawn</HI> (son to <HI>Mahobet-cawn</HI>) Viceroy of <HI>Bange,</HI> to retaliate him: this young Gallant delaies not, but with twenty thousand horse interposes 'twixt the Citie and <HI>Tartarr,</HI> gives him so furious a charge, that <HI>Ihen Thouz</HI> is afraid to suffer it, by base flight leaving his honour, halfe his men, and store of wealth to <HI>Zaed-cawn,</HI> and by his joviall troopes to be rifled: after which, they enter <HI>Tartary,</HI> and as farre as <HI>Gassany,</HI> burne, spoyle, and make havock of what they meet with, returning with great wealth and many Elephants to <HI>Ka∣bul,</HI> where with all acclamations of joy they are welcomed, and by <HI>Iang∣heer</HI> so accepted of, that he sends <HI>Zaed-cawn</HI> many thanks, and adds to his former troopes 5000 as an augmentation of more honor and benefit.</P>
<P>This cloud once over-blowne, the Horizon appeares more glorious, and <HI>Iangheer</HI> contemplates in what part to enjoy with his beloved <HI>Noor-mahall</HI> most pleasure. <HI>Cassimeer</HI> at length gets the preheminence: It a∣bounds with variety of choyce sports, but the progresse was long and re∣mote from most places whence in those active times hee was to receive in∣telligences; howbeit, delight swaied him against all objections, giving <HI>Curroon</HI> (by that distance) so faire an advantage, that with all speed (sen∣ding his Umbraves word to follow him) hee forsakes <HI>Decan,</HI> and through <HI>Gulcunda</HI> and <HI>Orixa,</HI> speeds into <HI>Bangala,</HI> yea with foure thousand horse, and three hundred Elephants passes the solitary deserts and so sud∣denly presents his forces afore <HI>Dehaka,</HI> that <HI>Abrahim-cawn,</HI> governing that Province (blasted with amazement) flies away first to <HI>Bannaras,</HI> then to <HI>Meslipatan,</HI> and knowes not where to rest securely: whiles <HI>Curroon</HI> smiles at it, &amp; without stay or let, commands his treasure; with mony and faire words so bewitching most of the Umbraves of that fruitfull Country, that they immediatly came to do him service with horse, mony, &amp; armory.</P>
<P>Overjoyed with such good hap, this daring Prince breaks into <HI>Purop,</HI> flashing (as to the other) such terrour into the eyes and heart of <HI>Makolidis∣chan</HI> the Governour, that without any show of manhood or pollicie hee posts to <HI>Elabass</HI> to acquaint <HI>Rustan</HI> the Captaine with his danger, by whom (in stead of thanks) he is soundly rated, and for his cowardize imprisoned.</P>
<P><HI>Curroon</HI> heares of it: but so long as hee continues prosperous, hee re∣gards no mans misery, but rather by such, increases his activity; passing his Army over <HI>Ganges,</HI> he aymes at <HI>Kerry</HI> not doubting of the conquest; but by the way at <HI>Radgee Mahal</HI> is with such fury assaulted by <HI>Ebraim-chan</HI> (by this time reincouraged, and here ambuscadoed with six thousand horse) that little wanted of foiling him, had not <HI>Abdul-chan</HI> (behind with best part of his Army) hastily brought up his troope, and by 3 houres skirmish reco∣vered him, after three thousand were slaine of <HI>Curroons</HI> party, and foure thousand of <HI>Ebrahims,</HI> who also lost his life by his too great avarice amongst

<P><HI>Perwees</HI> heares of <HI>Curroons</HI> extravagancies, and intends to curb him: he commits <HI>Brampore</HI> to <HI>Rustan-chan</HI> and <HI>Laskar-kawn;</HI> and with 50000 horse aymes with long toyle at <HI>Elebasse,</HI> and entring <HI>Lala Bersinghs</HI> territories, <HI>Lala</HI> meets him with 7000 horse, and gives him a Present of 3 leck of roopees.</P>

<P><HI>Hasser,</HI> (five courses from <HI>Brampore</HI> as you passe to <HI>Agray,</HI> the strong∣est, and in all advantages the best defended Castle through <HI>Chandis</HI>) is built upon the top of a most high and precipitious Mountaine, wall'd by Nature, and capable to feed and lodge forty thousand horse: within, are springs of wholsome water, by vertue whereof the people are infi∣nitly inriched; the earth also is excellently fruitfull in hearbs and corne and what else is requirable for defence or pleasure: upon all sides are mounted great Ordinance of brasse, about six hundred, here placed by the last King of <HI>Gusurat:</HI> but one discommodity is commixed, making all the other delights relish unseasonably; Wormes ingendring in the legges and thighs of such as drinke the water; but lately noted; and which on∣ly gave <HI>Ecbar</HI> conquest of this Castle, otherwise inexpugnable.</P>
<P><HI>Iangheer</HI> the great <HI>Mogul</HI> rejoyces at the severall victories his son <HI>Per∣wees</HI> and <HI>Mahobet-cawn</HI> are crowned with: and to expresse how well hee took it, observing the valour &amp; loyalty of <HI>Ganna-zied-cawn,</HI> (lately made Viceroy of <HI>Kabul</HI>) calls him to Court, expresses his good will in variety of complements, and more then so, addes five thousand horse to his com∣mand, and under seale makes him Governour of <HI>Bengala,</HI> of all the Pro∣vinces of <HI>Indostan</HI> most famous, rich, and populous: <HI>Bengala,</HI> is a Province in <HI>India,</HI> spacious, noble, and fruitfull; peopled with Mahometans and Idolaters, addict to Mars and Merchandize: reasonable in shape and co∣lour: well cloathed, extreamly lustfull; jealous, crafty, and suspicious: the ground is redundant in good Townes, Castles, fruits, flowers, corn, &amp;c. mellowed by <HI>Ganges,</HI> which in two great branches flowes thorow her, and 200 miles asunder, at 23 degrees, commixes with the Ocean.</P>
<P><HI>Normal</HI> and <HI>Assaph-cawn</HI> cast a squint eye upon <HI>Ganna-zied-cawns,</HI> new glory, wishing fit occasion to eclipse it; and only for that he was son to <HI>Mahobet;</HI> no other reason caused it: they are no trewands in the schoole of mischiefe, and in the first place, to plot more mischievously, and af∣front <HI>Mahobet</HI> (whose miseries are now broaching) they get the old <HI>Mogul</HI> to command <HI>Mahobet</HI> without delay, to send <HI>Ganganna</HI> the Captaine, un∣to <HI>Agra, Meza-Arebdestoa-cawn</HI> (one of <HI>Normals</HI> creatures) delivers the message, and <HI>Mahobet</HI> (loth to shew any example of disobedience, though he knew <HI>langheer</HI> abused, and this a meere plot of his confusion) lets him go, who forth with begins to chatter and spit his utmost malice against <HI>Ma∣hobet,</HI> exhibiting many false complaints, and incensing as much as possible the old <HI>Mogul</HI> against his innocent Champion: that hee had most unjustly put to death his sonne and others of his kindred, out of malice; yea, after he had voluntarily left <HI>Curroon</HI> to serve in the Kings Armie. These ac∣cusations wrought somewhat in the credulous jealousie and weaknesse of the old <HI>Mogul;</HI> but more, when from the seeds of haste and distrust sown by <HI>Ganna</HI> in the heart of <HI>Perwee,</HI> by his letter he intreats his Father to call <HI>Mahobet,</HI> a detractor of his glory, and ambtious to ingulph the Monarchy. This so confirmes the <HI>Mogul,</HI> that without more dispute or memory of
<PB N="95" REF="53"/>
his former services, he beleeves <HI>Gangannas</HI> reports no longer malicious, but presently condemnes him of pride and ingratitude, gives his com∣mand to <HI>Cawn Iehan,</HI> and commands him home to receive his deservings. <HI>Frau de perit virtus, Mahobet</HI> admires the villany of <HI>Ganganna,</HI> and <HI>Noor∣mall;</HI> and thinkes (by the purity of his owne conscience) it is impossible his Master should really beleeve such imputations; till remembring his dotage upon <HI>Normal</HI> and her inveterate spleen, hee grants it; but resolves to take another course till time might delucidate his innocency; and therefore as his love and dutie bound him, hee goes to Prince <HI>Perwees</HI> to bid farewell; but when hee perceived him so strangely altered, so coy and stately, it welnigh struck him dead with sorrow and amazement (an excellent sympathy and union, till <HI>Ganganna</HI> dissolv'd it, having beene till then betwixt 'em:) so that with a sad heart, and tormented eyes, he leaves the Camp, but carries along with him the hearts and courages of all the Army. From <HI>Brampore</HI> hee goes; many guesse, but none (no not himselfe) knowes whither his fortune led him: at length by advice of his best friends (that assured him if hee went to Court, hee should at least bee branded with the name of Traytor) hee travels to his Castle of <HI>Ran∣tampore,</HI> resolving to purge his honour by letter and proofe to <HI>Iangheer,</HI> and to safegard himselfe from the spite of <HI>Normal</HI> and all his enemies.</P>
<P>The discord of <HI>Peiwees, Mahobet,</HI> and <HI>Normal,</HI> sounds sweetly in <HI>Cur∣roons</HI> eares; hoping by the confusion of them all, to ground stedfastly his owne ambitious practises: and perceiving his old Father so taken with fan∣tasmes and apparitions of love, he resolves to practise deceit, and in the <HI>Moguls</HI> weaknesse to fix the strength of his conspiracies: he presents him by <HI>Godgee Iehan</HI> (a crafty man, and Tutor to his two sonnes) a letter neat∣ly pend, but dictating nothing save hypocrisie and submission: hee knew also the greedy appetite of his Father after gold and rarities, and there∣fore addes a pishcash of rare coignes, a hundred choise Elephants, and some portraits hee borrowed from the Portugals. They are all well taken; his sonnes respected, and word is sent him from <HI>Assaph-cawn</HI> of hopes to re-ingraft him. In the meane time, <HI>Madoffer-cawn</HI> at <HI>Lahore</HI> receives the government or Provostship of <HI>Agra,</HI> from <HI>Cassem-cawns</HI> pride, who was placed there upon his marriage which <HI>Movissan-begem</HI> sister to the Queen, but is so impatiently digested by that ambitious woman, that shee ceast not till she had got him re-established.</P>
<P>Six yeares past, <HI>viz.</HI> 1618. and of the Heg. 998. I told you, how <HI>Iangheer</HI> at request of <HI>Assaph-cawn</HI> took his eldest son <HI>Gushroo</HI> from <HI>Anna-Rha-Radia</HI> &amp; <HI>Chan Iehan,</HI> delivering him to <HI>Curroon,</HI> who finding him a stumbling block to the Imperiall Crowne, by <HI>Radgee Bandor</HI> gets him removed: at that same time were committed to that Fratricide, <HI>Sha Hossen</HI> and <HI>Ethymor</HI> (sonnes to <HI>D' haen Shaw</HI> his brother who died of drink at <HI>Brampore</HI>) whom because hee saw towardly, and apt to revenge their Fathers untimely death, hee was desirous to send them in that bloody bath, to sudden de∣struction; but he durst not perpetrate such apparant butchery, perceaving all mens eyes and expectations after them, and the death of their Father and Uncle, not a little murmured at: so that he had no other way to pre∣vent their power and anticipate their claime unto the Empire, but by get∣ting

them instructed in the faith of our blessed Saviour Christ, and to bee baptized; by that trick out of the <HI>Alchoran,</HI> making them incapable of so great an earthly Monarchy, but heyres of a better; for, <HI>virtus locum habet inter astra.</HI> After this, he ever led them with him to keep them the strict∣lier, till such time as he was vanquisht at <HI>Elabas</HI> by <HI>Rustan-cawn:</HI> for then <HI>Ethamore</HI> escapes to <HI>Perwees,</HI> and thence to <HI>Labore</HI> where his Vncle en∣tertaines him gladly, and marries him to <HI>B'har Bannoo Begem</HI> his daughter: and at <HI>Curroons</HI> next flight from <HI>Brampore, Hussen</HI> also flies to <HI>Radgee Rustang,</HI> and thence to his brother, where hee lived safely and more honoured.</P>

The message is so tart and sent to one (then whom none more) impatient of injuries, that hee returnes his Master the <HI>Mogul</HI> this reply, he was ready (as a thousand times former∣ly) to spend his life and goods to do him service, but would never stoope to the lure of his inveterate enemies; he was ready to account the reason, but upon condition hee might bee free from the tallons of his rammage foes, whom he saw ready to prey upon him: with this answer the Post re∣turnes, with newes also, that <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> (either weary of such vagaries, or that hee saw the winde of <HI>Curroons</HI> good fortune averse, or doubting his former envie might undo him) for some of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abdul cawn <HI>leaves</HI> Cur∣roons <HI>party.</HI></NOTE> or all, flies from <HI>Curroon,</HI> and by <HI>Cown Iehan</HI> at <HI>Brampore</HI> with <HI>Perwees</HI> is joyfully wel∣comed.</P>
<P><HI>Iangheer</HI> wonders at <HI>Mahobet-cawns</HI> presumption, but <HI>Mahobet</HI> no lesse admires his ingratitude. But after much perswasion of his kindred &amp; friends about him, hee assumes fresh courage, and attended by five thousand vo∣luntary Rashboots, issues from his Castle, and through <HI>Rassanwer</HI> journeyes to <HI>Lahore,</HI> resolving to make his owne defence to <HI>Iangheer,</HI> then removing to <HI>Kabul,</HI> or dy in doing it. The Queene and <HI>Assaph-cawn</HI> have notice of his intent, but fearing his force, and that (if hee had any private discourse with <HI>Iangheer</HI>) hee would re-ingratiate himselfe, they make the Mogull set to his seale to what they had indited, the command being that <HI>Mahobet</HI> should come in person, attended only with some few of his choyce friends to cleare his infamy: but hee smels their craft, and in his place, sends his sonne in law to make his excuse, and to treat upon surer tearmes than if he had gone in person: with a willing heart this young Gallant undertakes it, and at his first entrance into the <HI>Lescar</HI> (without ever seeing the Mo∣gul) hee is made to dismount his Elephant by the Queenes order, is dis∣roabed of his bravery, and clad in nasty ragges; is after that most mise∣rably chabuck't, or beat upon the soles of his feet with canes or rattans, bare-headed (the greatest shame possible) set backward upon a carrion Iade, with kettle-Drums led through the Army, and made a scoffe to all that rascall multitude; overjoyed, they had this good occasion to mani∣fest their hate upon the Idea of <HI>Mahobet-cawn</HI> and to delight the Em∣presse.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="54"/><HI>Mahobet-cawn</HI> is quickly certified of his sons disgrace, and that <HI>Iangheer</HI> knew it not; he questions not who, the whole Country blaming <HI>Normall</HI> and <HI>Ganganna</HI> for such barbarisme: in it, hee sees their hate and his owne misery, if he had harkened to their oaths for safety to come weakly ac∣companied: and now (more than ever, discovering the Queenes ambi∣tion to advance her sonne, and <HI>Assaph-cawn, Curroon,</HI> guarding themselves with a constant Army of thirty thousand horse, violently seazing the Mo∣guls treasure, and in all affaires abusing his authority and greatnesse, with other indignities apparant to all the Empire) he incourages himselfe, not regarding the hatefull epethite they branded him with in their Proclama∣tion; his innocency to <HI>Iangheer</HI> and zeale to <HI>Bullochy</HI> (next heire undoubted to the Crowne) re-animating him; so that after he had sent his old Master the Mogul a short, but pithy Apologie of his contempt, and portrayed the villany they offered his sonne; he surveighs his Army, gives strict com∣mand to offer no violence to <HI>Iangheer</HI> or his Tent, and with twenty thousand valiant Rashboots passes on to finde out <HI>Normalls</HI> Army and the <HI>Lescar,</HI> at that time consisting of above 50000 men: by accident part at that instant went by, led by <HI>Eradet-cawn;</HI> and the residue passed the river <HI>Phat,</HI> conducted by <HI>Godgee Abdul Hussan,</HI> in hope to finde <HI>Mahobets</HI> Army unprepared, but in vaine; for that experienced warrior knew hee should want no stratagems to destroy him, and therefore slept the Lions sleepe, with the eyes of prevention alwayes open; and now finding the advan∣tage his, gives the word unto his Camp, and with an undaunted heart charges <HI>Eradet</HI> first, and circles his troops with such speed and order, that in lesse than two houres (ere <HI>Abdul Hussan</HI> got over all his men) hee not only disordered, but slew above six thousand men, filling the residue with such feare, that each fled for his owne safety; but unluckily; the flood without mercy swollowed most of them, both dangers equally so confoun∣ding them, that with gastly lookes and loud outcries, such as escaped made knowne the horror of their conflict; so that the other part of <HI>Normalls</HI> Army stood still; till by <HI>Assaph-cawn, Abdul Hussen,</HI> and other Umbraves, they are cheered up, and prepare to encounter the rebells, who with <HI>Mahobet</HI> their Generall were come in front, and with victory in their fore∣heads (regarding neither their greatnesse nor multitude) rush couragiously on their adversaries, for five houres giving and receiving blowes, each side equally heated with rage, and inflamed with desire of conquest. The Queenes Army were fresh and excellently fitted, but by the overthrow of <HI>Eradet</HI> their companion not a little amazed; <HI>Mahobets</HI> men, though come from farre, yet of a more warlike constitution, and led by a second Mars, were hopefull of mighty gaine and glory; so that in the end, <HI>Normalls</HI> side gave back, well beaten, and unable any longer to abide the heavie strokes of their Iron adversaries; <HI>Assaph-cawn</HI> flies up and downe like a distracted man; upbraiding, intreating, and using all meanes possible to re-incourage them; but feare had slaine them, the Rashboots swords had flasht too much terror amongst them to revive againe; so that with a sad heart, upon his Arabian Courser he flies away, with <HI>Mirza Abontila</HI> his sonne, to a Castle not farre distant thence, but by accident are espied and chased by <HI>Mirsa Byrewer</HI> (<HI>Mahobets</HI> third sonne) and are forced out, and shackled in silver

fetters, are also brought to <HI>Attack</HI> and there kept, whiles <HI>Mahobet-cawn</HI> and his Army galloping in the Aire of good fortune beat downe the Queenes forces, at that time more willing to die than fight; so that with∣out more let, they proclaime themselves Lords of <HI>India,</HI> and prey upon infinite riches of all sorts in the Lescar now scattered and triumphed over. The old Mogul (not scared with <HI>Belloma</HI> brazen noyse and clangot) was found sleeping, yea luld in Morpheus golden bed, till by <HI>Mahobet-cawn</HI> hee is awaked and assured of his welfare; upon a stately Elephant they conveighed him to <HI>Attack,</HI> leaving slaine behind him twelve thousand men, and many Umbraves of note, <HI>Mirza Cassem, Radgee Doola Abdul-Gallec, Abdul Samet, Mirchan, Godgee Shawarchan</HI> and others: and taken prisoners, <HI>Iangheer,</HI> Queene <HI>Normall, Assaph-cawn, Mirza Abontila</HI> his son, <HI>Sultan Bullochy, Sultan Sheriar, Sha Ethimore, Sha Hossen, Eradet-cawn Mokendaschan, Mocrib-cawn,</HI> and <HI>Molena Mahomet;</HI> all which, to the amaze∣ment of the world, are led prisoners to <HI>Kabull</HI> to expect the pleasure of their conquerour. Now, is <HI>Mahobet-cawn</HI> elevated upon the majestick chariot of command and glory: yet resolves in no sort to derogate from the splendor of his Master, his only aime being to cleare his honour from scandall, and to retaliate his enemies what in his friends hee had for∣merly suffered. <HI>Normall</HI> (now clouded with shame and misery) is brought forth, and by the monster multitude exclaimed on; so that by assent of <HI>Mahobet</HI> and many other Umbraves she is censur'd to be beheaded. Not till then did shee perceive the thorny path shee had too long walked in, nor meditated upon the mutability of Fortune, nor till then could she frame her ambitious heart to feare or servitude. But seeing no remedy, she armes her selfe with patience, and craves a farewell of her Lord, to whom after much ado she is admitted, where she prostrates her selfe cloa∣thed in so much sorrow &amp; repentance, that <HI>Iangheer</HI> melts into compassion, and intreats <HI>Mahobet</HI> for her freedome. The request seemes grievous unto <HI>Mahobet,</HI> but loath in any thing to discontent him, or shew disloyalty, hee condiscends, <HI>Normall</HI> is pardoned and set at liberty, and becomes more in∣raged by this his lenity and complement: the residue of the royall priso∣ners are used with all respect and noblenesse; <HI>Eradet,</HI> and <HI>Molena Mahomet</HI> excepted, who by too much rigor are inraged and <HI>Molena</HI> died, <HI>Zadoc-cawn</HI> sped best, for before the fight (upon some occasion iarring with his brother <HI>Assph-cawn,</HI>) he fled to <HI>Mahobet,</HI> and is for his service made Vice∣roy of <HI>Lahore,</HI> and <HI>Cassem-cawn</HI> (by mediation of <HI>Moweza-begem</HI> his wife, sister to the Queene) restored to his government of <HI>Agray,</HI> and <HI>Ma∣daffor-cawn</HI> displaced; so that now, <HI>Mahobet</HI> swayes <HI>Indus'tan,</HI> till by vi∣cissitude of time hee decayes, and all things are redacted to better order and existence.</P>
<P><HI>Curroon,</HI> is at this time in <HI>Decan</HI> lurking till hee might espie some good advantage to recover his lost fame, and once more shake off the dis∣honourable Title of a Rebellious exile: but when newes is brought him from <HI>Assaph-cawn,</HI> of the almost incredible change the Empire had, and with what a dismall vayle it was then inveloped, his Father and Fatherin∣law being in such base subjection, <HI>Sultan Bulloch</HI> and Prince <HI>Daniels</HI> sonnes imprisoned, and his owne two sonnes with <HI>Godghee Iehan</HI> their governour

<P><HI>Melec Amber,</HI> so soone as <HI>Curroon</HI> was parted, (to get affection from <HI>Per∣wees</HI> also) gives liberty without treaty or ransome to <HI>Laskar-chan, Ebre∣hem-Hossen</HI> and <HI>Mirza Manout-sher,</HI> and with a convoy leaves them at <HI>Brampore.</HI> The same moneth <HI>Mahobet-chan</HI> received 26 leck of roopees from <HI>Channazeid-chan</HI> his sonne vice-roy of <HI>Bengala,</HI> which he extracted as annuall rent out of <HI>Pattana, Soughtar, Banaras, Sonargan,</HI> and <HI>Chatigan,</HI> rich and well peopled Citties upon <HI>Ganges;</HI> as also out of <HI>Sondiva</HI> (an isle 20 leagues from <HI>Catigan</HI>) than which is none more fruitfull in India. <HI>Ian∣gheer</HI> also removing from <HI>Chabull</HI> to <HI>Lahore,</HI> by <HI>Nomalls</HI> perswasion condescends to the slaughter of such Rashboots as <HI>Mahobet</HI> had mixed
<PB N="100" REF="56"/>
with his own guard; and after that to destroy <HI>Mahobet,</HI> ere he received any supply of men from his kinsmen <HI>Chan-Alem</HI> and <HI>Radgee-Rustang</HI> then comming towards him: and for her part, to second him and leave no∣thing undone or unattempted that might conduce to the execution of such great designes, she empties all her husbands coffers, and hyres men from all places to serve her; so that <HI>Ouripargan</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Bassowere</HI> brings her 5000 horse, <HI>Godgee-Tzera</HI> 3000, <HI>Madoffer-chan</HI> 12000, and of her owne 19000 more: hoping also that <HI>Faedi-chan</HI> (fled from the battell of <HI>Atteck</HI> into the deserts of <HI>Thombel</HI> to <HI>Radgee Ghomanoo</HI>) would associate her: but he was so affraid of <HI>Mahobets</HI> fierce encounters, that he would no more of them; but went to <HI>Perwees</HI> at <HI>Brampore,</HI> to whom (by a com∣mendatory letter from <HI>Rajea-Bertzingh</HI>) he is welcome. <HI>Mahobet-chan</HI> (ignorant of <HI>Iangheers</HI> confederacy) has notice of the Queens pro∣ject and forces, and is not amated; but with a constant bravery goes on to fight with her. In the way (at his Masters request) he uses <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> and his sonne with more respect than formerly. <HI>Normall</HI> also hastens to∣wards him, having sent her sonne <HI>Sheryar</HI> to <HI>Labore</HI> with 8000 horse to secure that Imperiall city against <HI>Mahobet.</HI> In his passage, by great good hap he chances upon <HI>Sultan Bullochy</HI> and the two christned Princes, whom he rescued; and got so privately and with such haste into <HI>Lahore,</HI> that without resistance most of the Rashboots were cut off, and the castle mann'd with the Queens Army. <HI>Iangheer</HI> also, rowsed out of his long sleep playes his part; for being come to <HI>Rheed</HI> within 8 myles of <HI>Normall</HI> and her Army, (and having at all tymes the freedome of hunting, hank∣ing, and such like pastime, he makes it his advantage) escapes, and is joy∣fully welcomed by the Queen, who (crying out <HI>Mombarick</HI>) impales him in her armes, and cryes for joy; then, gives present order to march on to assaile the Traytors.</P>
<P><HI>Mahobet-chan</HI> (like all other motions, when at highest, descend) quickly knowes of <HI>Iangheers</HI> flight, and is not so grieved at his being gone, as in the manner, intending never to withhold him longer than he fancied: yet the revolt of 5000 of his men did not a little trouble him: howbeit, per∣ceiving his enemyes were approaching, and that it was no fit tyme to dwell upon circumstances, he apparrells himselfe in a rich and tryed coat of mayle, and with his shield and speare spurs up in view of the Moguls <HI>Lescar;</HI> where, by all signes he perceives the Mogulls affection estranged; he sighes at it, and returnes, orders his army, and after a short Oration goes on in front to begin the combat. Ere the Battell be∣gan, <HI>Balant-chan</HI> affronts him with a peremptory Message from the King, to this effect; that if he desired to be thought loyall, he should expresse it by releasing <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> and the other Umbraves whom he kept impri∣soned; by whose mediation he might peradventure obteine pardon for such his high rebellion: <HI>Mahobet-chan</HI> knowes it was <HI>Normalls</HI> device, yet loth in any thing to distate the King, sends him a protest of his zeale and loyalty, and that so soon as he came to the river <HI>Behed,</HI> his desires should be accomplished: so, he arises, and at the place presigned, calls for <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> and his sonne; shewes him he had power to confound him, but his vertue swayed him to another end; which sayd, he not only pulls away
<PB N="101" REF="56"/>
his markes of servitude, but vests him with rich and princely roabes, mounts him upon his best courser, girds him with a pretious blade, and with a convoy of eight hundred horse presents him to Court, his farewell onely poynting to remember him. <HI>Iangheer</HI> receives him with teares of love, but <HI>Normall</HI> with supercilious looks and words of disdaine, upbraiding him with cowardize that durst not attend her tyme or depend upon her power to force him from a rebell she both scornd and hated. <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> laments her lunacy, but is affraid to contrary her; yet both in good will and private discourse at any tyme with the King, he speaks well of <HI>Mahobet</HI> and labours his reconciliation.</P>
<P>The affaires of <HI>Industant</HI> subject to this variety, possesses all mens minds with astonishment. Whiles <HI>Iangheer</HI> and his beloved <HI>Amazon</HI> with the <HI>Lescar</HI> passe on to <HI>Lahore</HI> to advise with <HI>Sheriar,</HI> and to reduce all Majesty (too long divellicated) to the proper station: But what pleasure can the contemplation of her reviving glory afford her, so long as <HI>Mahobet</HI> her mortall Enemie lives unpunished? shee knowes not why shee is intituled sole Empresse of best parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> Commandresse of so much men and trea∣sure, so long as <HI>Mahobet</HI> an obscure Rashboote dares eclipse her splendor, and travell too and fro unresisted, guarded with such applause and popu∣larity: shee ruminates a thousand severall sorts of revenge, but by too much choise knowes not which to fasten on: the surest and most honou∣rable is by warre, and thereupon calls <HI>Amet-chan,</HI> (<HI>Brahim-chans</HI> cozen) <HI>Zeffer-chan, Nouradin-Cooly, Anna Rha Radia, Emyrchan, Mircomyr, Immir∣za Rustan,</HI> and other Nobles, desiring them to hasten <HI>Mahobets</HI> destruction, an imployment wherein they should finde a gratefull remuneration. Each man promises his best endeavour, and with fifteene thousand horse goe joyntly on to attempt it: in the first place (hearing of some treasure his sonne <HI>Zaedchan</HI> had sent him out of <HI>Bengala</HI>) they ambush neere <HI>Cheban-Chebaed</HI> (a Castle of strength) and break out upon the Rashboots that then were no more but eight hundred valiant men, who sold their money at a deere rate, two thousand of <HI>Normalls</HI> men giving their lives for it and for her ambition; but by their multitude were at last defeated, and most of them slaughtered; leaving 26 lack or 2600000 rupees to their avarice, which was brought to <HI>Lahore,</HI> and there some part given for salary, the rest was coffered.</P>
<P><HI>Ganganna,</HI> (<HI>Chan-Channa</HI> some men call him, by this time recovered) by bribery and great braggs is made Generall of <HI>Normalls</HI> Forces. <HI>Mahobet-chan</HI> is not troubled at it; but the revolt of his wild sonne <HI>Byrewer</HI> afflicts him sadly. This young Gallant had no sooner triumphed over <HI>Assaph-can,</HI> whom he delivered to his Father (as is spoken of) but with three thousand horse (his Father had made him Coronell of) hee is intreated to assaile <HI>Radgea Tzettersingh</HI> at <HI>Nornon</HI> his Enemy; but not regarding his Fathers instruction, turnes another way by <HI>Bengor</HI> to force his Fathers Castle of <HI>Rantipore,</HI> but in vaine, for <HI>Motzaibchan</HI> the Captaine suspecting him, fools him with faire words, and breakes his forces; and <HI>Beyrewer</HI> flying thence, is by <HI>Ray Ruttang</HI> at <HI>Bondy</HI> taken and imprisoned.</P>

of <HI>Curroon,</HI> and his late adversity; yea, gives his lascivious mind full scope, and involves himselfe with the effeminate roabes of sloth and wantonnesse: but in the plenitude of those his joyes, the glory of his estate growes cloudy, and his motion whirles into a malignant Orbe, by the dis∣consolate Newes hee receives from <HI>Brampore</HI> of his beloved sonnes death. His eyes grow dim, his heart turnes leady, and all conceits of pleasure re∣lish unsavourie when the departure of <HI>Perwees</HI> objects it selfe, and those hopes and comforts he had in him, seeme fantasticall. <HI>Goushroo</HI> and <HI>Sha Da∣niel</HI> are dead; <HI>Perwees</HI> is now no more: <HI>Sha Ethimore</HI> and <HI>Hussen</HI> his grand children made Christians: <HI>Bullochy</HI> is a child: <HI>Sheriare</HI> a foole, and <HI>Cur∣roon</HI> the very eye-sore of his conceptions; a rebell, wilde, proud, greedy, treacherous, and deceitfull: himselfe was old, and at his death the Empire subject to innovation or domestick consumption: in these and such like do∣lorous cogitations <HI>Iangheer</HI> spends the weary minutes of his life, till death <HI>ultima poena</HI> (as they call it) summons him in few moneths after to the resignation of his life and Empire: Whiles <HI>Maehobet Chawn</HI> chawes the af∣flicting newes also of Prince <HI>Perwees</HI> his death. 'Twixt whom (forgetting <HI>Gangannas</HI> trechery) was most exact friendship and sympathie. He sees (in him) the privation of all his joyes, the hopes he had in his suceession anni∣hilated, and the ambition of <HI>Normall</HI> and <HI>Assaph Cawn</HI> (suspected to have poysoned him) ingendring to a monstrous height; so that bidding farewell to the world and all other society and imployments, he contracts himselfe to privacie and solitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahobet-cawn</HI> turnes Eremite.</NOTE> feeding upon contemplation of what had past, and the lubricity of terrestriall pleasures, vaine-glory, and other vanities: he forsakes his strong and delightfull Castle <HI>Rantampore,</HI> and through <HI>Zia∣lor</HI> comes to <HI>Radgee Zirmol,</HI> and under licence fixes at <HI>Zirmol</HI> where hee anchorites.</P>
<P>But <HI>Curroones</HI> ayre swells with Chymaeraes, now more than ever af∣fecting the Empire, none but children interposing him: hee knew his Fa∣thers affection was easily recovered, and <HI>Assaph Kawn</HI> his restlesse projector carefull to state him in the chaire of Majesty: so that, arm'd with confi∣dence and accompanied with forty Elephants and fifteene hundred horse∣men he leaves <HI>Baker, Chytor, Tutta;</HI> and through <HI>Tesel, Chobager,</HI> and <HI>Ec∣clisser,</HI> comes to <HI>Masser Thormet</HI> in <HI>Decan,</HI> where <HI>Melec</HI> receives him with all joy, and adds to his troopes foure thousand horse with promise of forty thousand more to assist him upon any good occasion.</P>
<P>CHYTOR (in mid-way 'twixt <HI>Brampore</HI> and <HI>Adsmeer</HI>) is yet a Citie, just∣ly clayming precedencie for antiquity amongst all the Cities of <HI>Indya.</HI> It was formerly called <HI>Taxila,</HI> and that <HI>Metropolis</HI> whence King <HI>Porus</HI> issued against great <HI>Alexander; Ranna Radgee Mardoot</HI> lineally descended from him, of late yeeres and (till by intreaty of <HI>Sultan Curroon Anno</HI> 1614. he came to <HI>Agra,</HI> and in slight sort did some obeysance) here soveraignizing and in <HI>Oodipore,</HI> The Citie is at this day but meanly beautifull, three miles in compasse, not a third part of what was formerly. Time and war have fur∣row'd her, not onely disroabing her of her bravery in buildings where men inhabited, but in huge Temples of Idolatry, the ruines of above a hundred (once lofty in fastidious Turrets) to this day remaining, of stone; strong, good, white, and well polisht, rare and observable; now inhabited by

At that time, <HI>Iacont-cawn</HI> an Umbrave of great wealth, honour and experience, commanding eight thousand horse to serve <HI>Curroon,</HI> by many affronts without cause put upon him by <HI>Mirzaladin Melecks</HI> sonne, is inflamed with rage, and flies to <HI>Chan Ie∣han</HI> Generall of Prince <HI>Perwee's</HI> Army at <HI>Brampore,</HI> who receives him with joy, and by his exaspiration, with foure hundred Elephants and forty thousand horse make haste to <HI>Bellagate</HI> (the widdow and child of <HI>Sultan Perwees</HI> being committed to the care of <HI>Lescarcawn,</HI>) where they use all extremities of warre, spoyling, burning, and captiviting all they had a minde; to and by rare chance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abdul cawn <HI>disgrac't.</HI></NOTE> intercepting some letters from <HI>Godgee Hes∣sary,</HI> they discover <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> (whom some call <HI>Abdulla-cawn</HI>) (the wea∣thercock of those times) his intent, to turne from the Kings party and re∣tvtue to <HI>Curroon:</HI> hee is convicted, his estate confiscate, his honour re∣verst, himselfe manacled, cald the darling of inconstancy, and upon an Elephant in disgracefull sort from the Army sent to <HI>Brampore,</HI> where by <HI>Lascar-cawn</HI> hee is imprisoned. This done, they enter <HI>Decan</HI> with all speed, and pierce most fortunatly into the mid'st of <HI>Melecks</HI> Kingdome, doing what they pleased without opposition; so that after six weekes hostility, they returne loaden with abundance of wealth, and over-joyed with their easie victory. But (when they thought themselves most sure) <HI>Melec</HI> presents himselfe in an advantagious place with eighty thousand men, incircling them on the one side, &amp; the stupendious hills on the other, so that surrounded with amazement, and clad with black ragges of discon∣tent, they incamp; not daring to hazard the fight, or by stratagem break out to hazard their deliverance; but in that miserable sort are lockt up, the <HI>Decan</HI> at on time offending them, till by famine finding no pleasure in their riches (where no meat on sure tearmes was to bee purchased) they were constrained to parle and submit, assured only of their lives, stript out of all their wealth and bravery, returning with more shame than they had honour formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Iangheer</HI> the great Mogull, has advertisement of this variable successe, but knowes not how to alter it; nor cares hee much, the death of <HI>Perwees</HI> so possesses him: yet, <HI>Normall</HI> ceases not to pursue her revenge against <HI>Maho∣bet;</HI> and finding him so hard to be dealt withall, begins will <HI>Channa-zeid-cawn</HI> his valiant sonne, whom sheere calls home and places <HI>Mocrib-cawn</HI> in his command, over five thousand horse and twelve thousand men; but he had small joy of his greatnes, for in lesse than three weekes being there, by accident (sailing over <HI>Ganges</HI>) the boat is over-turned, he drowned, and <HI>Fedi-cawn</HI> is made Viceroy of <HI>Bengala</HI> and <HI>Malacca</HI> after him: during

These he accepts most cheerefully, and scorning to be behind in courtesie, returnes her and her Lord, five hundred Dromidaries, swift and beautifull, a thousand horses of an excellent good shape and breed; some porcellan and other Chyna rarities: the Ambassador also presents the Mogull a double of such, 2000 horses, a thousand Dromidares, some sword blades, and other gifts of value, so great, that the report went, ne∣ver any Ambassador came so richly furnished, was better entertained, or went away more satisfied: Never let any Ambassador think himselfe wel∣come to any Asiatick Prince, that brings nothing for a present, save com∣plement, for not any Native dare petition, either the Mogull, or any of his great ones, without a present.</P>
<P>Yet is not <HI>Normall</HI> suited with content, so long as <HI>Mahobet</HI> made fru∣strate her vowes to have him ruined: her power seems small, her indea∣vours idle, seeing (as she thought) his ease was in contempt of her; so that her thoughts project, her dreames fancie severall waies for his destructi∣on: it gladded her in part to see his sonne <HI>Zeid-cawn</HI> out of imployment, and at Court (by such as adored her) scorn'd and confronted, howbeit, by <HI>Assaphs</HI> meane <HI>Iangheer</HI> affects him; yea <HI>Normall</HI> (had not the over∣flowing hate she bore his Father hindred her) had doubtlesse become amo∣rous, and made him in Cupids Court, <HI>Iangheers</HI> competitor; but spight ore swayes her, and revenge predominates; she calls <HI>Amir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han, Nouradri Cooly,</HI> and <HI>Hemyr beg</HI> her minions, to whom she discovers her desires, and intreats their diligence: they obey, and promise their care and faithful∣nesse, and with fifteene thousand horse advance to fight with him (whiles <HI>Normall</HI> and the King journey to <HI>Cassimeer</HI>) his <HI>ne plus ultra:</HI> and <HI>Assaph-cawn</HI> (mindfull of <HI>Mahobets</HI> kindnesse to him, loth so brave a man should perish for the lust and malice of a woman, and especially by his advantage to draw him to <HI>Curroon</HI>) by a swift: and trusty messenger, sends him a gra∣cious letter discovering his sisters wrath and resolution, and sollicits young <HI>Rana Radgee</HI> to further him.</P>

<P>But long this good Prince injoyes not his soverainty: for, <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> seeing all as he desired, speeds away a sure post with letters to <HI>Curroon,</HI> who made such haste, that in 14 dayes he runne 2500 of our myles, to <HI>Daita,</HI> (8 course from <HI>Necanpore</HI> and from <HI>Brodera</HI> or <HI>Radjepore</HI> 120 to the East.) in <HI>Decan,</HI> there finding him overjoyed with such good newes, and send∣ing his excuse to <HI>Melec-Amber</HI> the <HI>Decan</HI> King, hasts on with <HI>Mahobet-chan, Zulpheckar-chan,</HI> and 7000 other rashboots, and mancibdars through <HI>Guzurat</HI> to <HI>Amadavad,</HI> where by <HI>Saffin-chan</HI> he is welcomed: there hee slept not long, for making <HI>Agra</HI> the object of his race, he bids farewell to <HI>Saffin-chan,</HI> and with a greater troope (feeding them with great promises when he had the crowne) in three weeks travell comes to <HI>Agra,</HI> where he claymes the Imperiall Title, and is by his owne favorites proclaymed King, by name of <HI>Pot Shaw-Iehan:</HI> then giving notice to his Father in law <HI>Azaph-chan</HI> how farre and with what successe he had travelled, as also, that so long as <HI>Sultan Bulloch</HI> was living his owne greatnesse was but coun∣terfeit; <HI>Assaph-chan,</HI> flesht in former homicides, and not caring how, so he could fixe the Dyadem on <HI>Curroon</HI> at that tyme tottering, he makes

<HI>Radgee Bandor</HI> of his counsell, who forthwith without examination of right or wrong posts to <HI>Lahore,</HI> and with <HI>Assaph-chans</HI> keyes, enters the hummum or Bath where the innocent Princes were, and with a horrid speed and infernall cruelty strangles them all, to lead <HI>Curroon</HI> through such a bloody path unto the crowne.</P>
<P>In this miserable sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.M.</HI> 5598 <HI>A. D.</HI> 1628 <HI>A. H.</HI> 1008</NOTE> dyed young <HI>Bulloch</HI> but three moneths Emperour of <HI>Industant</HI> or great Mogul; in that massacre accompanying him, <HI>Sultan Sheryar, Sha-Ethimore</HI> and <HI>Sha-Hossen</HI> (the baptised sonnes of Prince <HI>Daniel</HI>) two sonnes of <HI>Sultan Perwees,</HI> two sonnes of <HI>Sultan Morad</HI> or <HI>A∣murath;</HI> all whose carcasses were without any respect buried in a garden in <HI>Lahore</HI> neere the entrayls of <HI>Iangheer:</HI> but their heads (as an assurance of their death) sent to <HI>Curroon,</HI> to glut his eyes (by so horrid a Spectacle) with infernall ambition.</P>
<P>The murther of the royall blood of <HI>Industand</HI> being known to <HI>Chan-Iehan, Zied-chan</HI>-and other Umbraves, they are orechardged with amaze∣ment and feare: they see <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> guilty, but want power to question him, especially (by inquisition) hearing it was <HI>Curroons</HI> commandement▪ they heap up a thousand maledictions on their heads and crave vengeance from above to recompence them. <HI>Curroon</HI> peceives the Empire storming at him, but his incantations quickly quiets them. And now after much toyle (having through the Ocean of inconstancy arrived at the port of greatnesse and ease as he thought) he gives order for his solemne coronation: which accordingly by a generall assembly of the great Umbraves, and Nobles of his Empire is performed; by second proclamation assuming the Name of <HI>Sultan-Sha-Bedyn-Mahumet.</HI> Then he orders the affaires of his Monar∣chy, placing and displacing at his pleasure; the Seraglio of his father is shut up: <HI>Normall</HI> and her three daughters are confined stricktly; <HI>Assaph-chan</HI> is made second in the Empyre; and next him <HI>Mahobet-chan; Abdul-chan</HI> is released; <HI>Channa-ziedchan</HI> is made viceroy of <HI>Bengala</HI> againe. Am∣bassadours from <HI>Persia, Arabia, Tartaria,</HI> and <HI>Decan</HI> come and joy him in his greatnesse. Divers <HI>Radgees,</HI> as <HI>Radgee-kessing</HI> from <HI>Nagor, Chan-Azem</HI> from <HI>Azimeer,</HI> the puissant <HI>Radgees Mainsingh, Tzettersingh,</HI> and <HI>Ghessingh,</HI> from <HI>Fettipore</HI> with 50000 horse move with great and solemne state to <HI>Agray;</HI> whither after (six weeks) came <HI>Assaph-chan, Zadoch-chan, Eradet-chan, Rustan-chan, Saffin-chan</HI> and <HI>Mirgomley:</HI> to all whom he gave thanks for ther severall Favours, remitting and putting in oblivion all offences and insults during his rebellion. After which, he proclaymes a Iubile ce∣lebrated by all men there, with all sports and delights possible!</P>
<P>Thus has <HI>Curroon</HI> (through a sea of blood) attayned the highest port and dignity of the eastern world, surrounded with delights, and guarded by a power (in his conceiving) unresistable; but these sinnes he makes nothing of, have apparantly in these our tymes drawn downe the heavy Iudgments of God almighty: both, in taking his beloved wife away the week of his inauguration, since when he has made his daughter (by that dead Lady) his wife; incest of so high a nature that that yeare his whole Empire was so wounded with Gods arrowes of plague, pestilence and Fa∣mine, this thousand yeares before never so terrible.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1634 1014</NOTE> The sword also seemes to threaten him, the Persians having snatched from him <HI>Kermaen</HI>

of old) to <HI>Iasques;</HI> a place hatefull to <HI>Mirza Bahadin</HI> the fourteenth King after him, that for most quiet removed <HI>An. D.</HI> 1312 of the <HI>Heg.</HI> 692 to this Ile and from that <HI>Harmuz</HI> (part of <HI>Maceta</HI>) twelve leagues from <HI>Kostack</HI> where his predecessors dwelt, so named it. From which time to this it was ever disturbed: first by <HI>Ioonsha</HI> the Persian King slaine by <HI>Vsan Cassan,</HI> who for pearles broke through <HI>Lar</HI> and forced <HI>Melec Nazomadin</HI> into Arabia, and againe recoverd by <HI>Mirza-codbadin</HI> 5 yeares after, <HI>viz. An.</HI> 1488; but long slept not so, for <HI>An.</HI> 1507 <HI>Alfonsus Albuquerq</HI> the Portuguise (after much adoe) subjected it to <HI>Emanuel</HI> his Master, suffering <HI>Zedfadin</HI> to enjoy the Title, and a pension of fifteene hundred crownes, but all command to him∣selfe, himselfe <HI>de facto</HI> King; and lastly by <HI>Emangoly-chan</HI> the Arch-Duke of <HI>Shyraz,</HI> by help of the English it was taken <HI>An.</HI> 1622, and by them dela∣pidat and depopulated. Let us view it as it was and is.</P>
<P>The Altitude of the pole here, is 27 degrees: and though it be with∣out the torrid zone, yet what by the sulphur of the earth, and oblique re∣flex of the burning Sun, for foure moneths (from May to September) no place in the world is more hot or scalding; it is the custome here to sleep in beds of rayne water, which is not very coole neither, all day naked: the City had a faire Bazzar, many Churches, and Frieries, brave Magazeens, stately houses, and as gallant a castle as any other in Orient; the castle is yet in good strength and repayre; the rest, levelled with the ground; of which I cannot say, <HI>Nunc seges ubi Troja fuit,</HI> the soile being uncapable of corne or other graine: at that end against <HI>Dozar</HI> (and the great <HI>Bannyan</HI> tree in the continent) the City was built; where the sea is so narrow that a Cannon may easily spit over: the whole Ile exceeds not fifteene myles compasse: it is the most barren ground in the world, neither tree nor spring of good water could we find in it. It has salt, silver shining sand, and mine∣ralls of sulphur; has nothing else worth the looking on: And yet from the advantagious standing, the laborious Portugal made it the staple and glory of the world; secured indeed by many naturall props, on all sides com∣manding Iles and townes to furnish her: <HI>Larac</HI> (<HI>Azgillia</HI> of old) <HI>Kishmy</HI> (by some cald <HI>Quexome</HI> or <HI>Broict</HI>) <HI>Keys</HI> or <HI>Queys</HI> Ile, <HI>Angen, Andreve</HI> (or <HI>de los pasharos</HI>) <HI>Kargh, Baharem</HI> (<HI>Icara</HI> in Pliny) <HI>Dozaro, Iasques,</HI> and <HI>Kostack</HI> in <HI>Margastan</HI> (now <HI>Mogestan</HI>) vicinating them. So as to the eye of man no place could be more offensive and defensive, garrisons of Portu∣galls ever lying in these Ilands; and yet, when the God of Nature had decreed a ruine, it could not be withstood, but was in some regard mira∣culously effected, and at such a tyme as they least suspected it.</P>
<P>But to doe her all the favour I can: let us remember such Princes as have honourd her: <HI>Sha-Mahomet</HI> is the first I find, who in the 80 yeare of the <HI>Heg:</HI> Of Christ 700, left his seat at <HI>Aman</HI> in Arabia, and sat downe at <HI>Calciat</HI> upon the shoare, but disliking it, removed to <HI>Costac</HI> in <HI>Mogestan</HI> (six and twenty leagues from <HI>Iasques</HI>) and there built a city which he cald <HI>Ormuz,</HI> and from whence part of Arabia took name; to him succceded <HI>Soli∣man,</HI> to him <HI>Izachan,</HI> to who <HI>Mahobet</HI> 2, <HI>Shawran-shaw,</HI> (who bequeathed the crowne to his Nephew) <HI>Emer-sha-bedin-Molong,</HI> whose daughter and heire married <HI>Seyfadin Aben-Ezer</HI> sonne to <HI>Ally-shaw</HI> Lord of <HI>Keys</HI> Iland: the crown (they wanting issue) then came to <HI>Sha-Bedin Mahomet</HI> his

cozen: to whom followed <HI>Rocnadin Mamut, Hamets</HI> son, who dying <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1278 left the rule to his Infant sonne, <HI>Seidfadin-Nocerat,</HI> who was slaine by his brother <HI>Morad</HI> or <HI>Masad</HI> eleaven yeares after, and he forc't to flie into <HI>Kermaen</HI> by his brothers servant <HI>Mir Bahadin: Mir Bahadin Ayaz</HI> or <HI>Ben-Seyfin Ben-Cabadin</HI> is forced to flie, unable to resist the Turks <HI>Morad</HI> brought against him, so with many of his friends (such as hated the Ty∣rant) removed to <HI>Kishny,</HI> but not liking the place, rises thence and sits down at this Ile <HI>Gerun</HI> (or wood) where he built, fortified (and from the others name) namd it <HI>Ormuz;</HI> in the yeare 1312, of the <HI>Heg.</HI> 692 and to him a man of noble extraction, <HI>Emir-Azadin-gurdan-shaw;</HI> to him his sonne <HI>Mabare-zadin-babron-sha,</HI> a brave Prince, but fell by the axe of treachery, <HI>Mir-sha-Bedin-Issuff</HI> stroke him with; who also fell by the late Princes youngest brother, <HI>Mirza-Codbadin</HI> was he cald, infortunately banisht by his cozen <HI>Melec-Nozamedin,</HI> at whose death <HI>Cobadin</HI> returnd and swayd the Ormou∣sian Scepter, and at his death left all to <HI>Paca-Turansha</HI> a victorious Prince yet by death <HI>An.</HI> 1488 conquered; to him <HI>Mozad-sha Bedin,</HI> to him <HI>Salger-sha,</HI> to him <HI>Shawez,</HI> and to him <HI>Safadin</HI> or <HI>Zedfadin</HI> 2, subdued by <HI>Albuquerq, An.</HI> 1507 and by him cruelly strangled: <HI>Nordino, Codjeature,</HI> and <HI>De lam-sha</HI> attempted the soverainty, but <HI>Mahomet</HI> the right heire was crowned King; he dying, his sonne <HI>Seyd-Mahomet-sha</HI> was called King, who <HI>Anno</HI> 1622 was subdued by the English and Persians, and at this day lives a pri∣soner at <HI>Shyraz.</HI> The Persian now is soveraine.</P>
<P>The particular Acts and passages in taking this famous Citie, is thus (for some mens better satisfaction) remembred.</P>
<P>At command of <HI>Shaw Abbas</HI> the Persian Monarch, <HI>Emangoly-chawn</HI> (chiefe Lord and Governour of those Territories that conjoyne the gulph of <HI>Persia</HI>) descends with nine thousand men, at such a time as he was confi∣dent to meet the English Fleet, resolv'd to further them in revenge of those many tyrannies they had endured by the braving Portugall: The Condi∣tions betwixt them, under hand and seale were these: 1. The Castle of <HI>Ormus</HI> (in case it were won) with all the Ordnance and Amunition to ac∣crue to the English. 2. The Persians were to build another Castle in the Ile at their owne cost, when and where they pleased. 3. The spoile to be equally devided. 4. The Christian prisoners to be disposed of by the English; the Pagans by the Persians. 5. The Persians to allow for halfe the charges of victualls, wages, shott, powder, &amp;c. 6. And the English to be custome free in <HI>Bander-gum-broon</HI> for ever. The Captaines of best note in the Pagan Army under the Duke of <HI>Shyraz,</HI> were <HI>Alliculybeg, Pollotbeg, Shakulibeg, Shareearee, Mahomet Sultan</HI> and <HI>Alybeg</HI> King of the Port: these with the rest of their Army encamped before <HI>Bander-gom-broon:</HI> and two dayes after <HI>viz.</HI> the twentieth of Ianuary 1622. with small difficulty be∣came Masters of the Port. Upon which the Duke and the English Cap∣taines, <HI>Weddall, Blyth,</HI> and <HI>Woodcock</HI> agreed upon an immediate battery, and instantly played upon the Castle with a dozen peeces of Cannon for five houres, but gave them small hopes of sudden conquest: yet that neither pusillanimity nor doubt might be seene amongst them, the ninth of Fe∣bruary the English transported three thousand Persians in two Frigots lately taken, and two hundred Persian Boats good for little other service: these, so soone as they were landed, having formerly made Sconces or
<PB N="116" REF="64"/>
Trenches for their men, and Bulwarks for the great Ordnance to play on, very furiously they made towards <HI>Ormus</HI> thinking to meet no great oppo∣sall; but the Portugalls though they let them land and passe quietly into the Towne, with equall resolution stopt the current of their fury, at first encounter from their barracadoes defended with shott and pike, slaying above three hundred, and with their Ordnance beat them back with more haste and amazednesse than their approach had courage: in this disorder a Flancker by mischance was blowne up, but the warre continued: little hurt accruing to either party, till the 24 of February, on which day the English advanced towards the Castle, (under which was riding the Portu∣gall Armado) and in despight of the Castle and best defence their Fleet could make, being then but five Gallyons and twenty Frigots, set fire on the Saint <HI>Pedro</HI> of one thousand five hundred Tun, and Admirall of their Armado: which mischance, the rest of the Spanish Fleet with no small sor∣row apprehended, and finding no repaire, to prevent more mischiefe and danger, cut the Cables, and in that flaming posture let her drive whither winde and tyde commanded her: the English saw her too hot to meddle with, and knew she could enrich the adventurer with no other booty, but <HI>Bellonaes</HI> furniture, so downe she went towards <HI>Larack,</HI> in the way a rabble of Arabians and Persians boorded her, &amp; like Iackhalls with hunger starved fury and avarice tore her asunder: that rapine, being no lesse base and out∣ragious than the fire which two houres had assaulted her:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 17. 1627.</NOTE> the seaven∣teenth of March the Persians (to dispatch and shew they were not idle) gave fire to a Mine stuft with forty barrells of powder, which blew up a great part of the wall, through which breach the enraged Portugalls im∣mediatly sallyed &amp; maintain'd the fight above one houre against the ama∣zed Persian, who had drawne out a mayne Battalion, but when the Trum∣pets sounded, <HI>Acha</HI> recovered sense and magnanimity, going on so coura∣giously, that the most slow and hindmost discovered plainly a full scorne of death, and powerfull desire of honourable execution: for nine houres this conflict continued with great fury, so that in fine the defendants were forced to retreat, advis'd to it as well by pollicie as need: for, the heated Persian supposing themselves victors, with great bravery begun to mount and enter the Citie in many quarters, at which the Portugalls were very joyfull, throwing on them such and so many Granadoes and burning fire∣balls, powder-pots, and scalding Lead, that the assailants in despight of their vowes and bravadoes were forced to retreat, and could not prevent a thousand of their men from perishing: which misery, when <HI>Shaculibeg</HI> at full had viewed, couragiously followed by two hundred men, hee past through the fury of those affrighting fires and took one of their Flanckers, but could not hold above halfe an houre, they were so outragiously fryed and tormented with shewers of flames of Lead and Sulphur, and in des∣cending were beaten off by fifty Haydalgoes, who for three houres affron∣ted them, repell'd them, and retyred crown'd with conquest. This enter∣tainment so cool'd their bravery, that for five dayes they did nothing but contemplate the valour and dexterity of their adversaries. But, the three and twentieth day assum'd more hopes, when they beheld the fight be∣twixt the English and them; our Cannon from the shore, playing so hotly
<PB N="117" REF="64"/>
and battring their fortifications so soundly, that at length making the ships their object (after a great mutilation of shrowds and masts) they sunk the Vice &amp; reare Admirall of <HI>Ru-Fryero's</HI> Fleet: by that, utterly losing their late hopes and ostentation of marine command and excellencie. March 28 necessity humble them (plague, famine, and fluxes raging in the City) so as five dayes after, two wel-bred Gentlemen, well attended, with great gravity mounted in a faire equipage to the Enemies Camp; they were usherd in by some Coozelbashes of <HI>Shaculybegs</HI> Regiment, and after small comple∣ment, begun to treat of peace, and that there might be a cessation of Armes, which favour if the Duke would grant, they were ready to acknowledge it, and for retribution to present him two hundred thousand Tomayns in hand, with good assurance of an annuall tribute of 140000 Ryalls, (which as afterwards they confessed was spoken in hypocrisie) the Captaine dis∣misses them, and appoints next day for answer, acquaints the Generall, who (wanting money) accepts their motion of peace, so they would depose five hundred thousand (amounting with us almost to two millions of pounds) and pay yeerely to the King of <HI>Persia</HI> hundred thousand: the Portugalls return'd him an answer, they were in no such distresse, to buy any favour so dishonourably, and that greedinesse so overwhelmed them, they assured, a fift part of that proportion should never buy their ablest benefits. After that, they mediated a reconciliation twixt the English and them, putting them in minde, how they were Christians, and by many reciprocall favours of old (when <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gant</HI> invaded them) and later times by allyances, prevalent enough to beget good will in noble spirits. If they had injured them, they were now sorry, and ready to satisfie in any punishment of paine or purse, their Kings were at that instant good friends, and how could such hostility be defended or answerd by law of Nations or Religion. These and the like were sent them, but whether the behavi∣our of the <HI>Fidalgo</HI> displeased our Sea men, or that they understood them not, or saw themselves so farre ingaged, that with reputation they could not desist, or that it was uttered with a faigned humility, or the like, I know not; the Messenger departed not well satisfied. And two dayes after, saw apparently signes of confusion and revenge: a hideous noise of hellish thunder amazing them, caus'd by the English their blowing up two seve∣rall Mynes, which gave open prospect into the Citie; but the hearts of the assaylants durst not travell with their sight, all their senses the last time were so confounded and disabled: so that very poorely they onely be∣came spectators, and gave new courage to the dying Portugall: all of them halfe dead, with fluxes, thirst, (the three pits in the Citie exhausted) fa∣mine or pestilence. The fourteenth day, a ship full of Moores from <HI>Kish∣mee,</HI> arrived at <HI>Ormus</HI> to help the Portugalls; perceiving themselves inter∣cepted, they returned back, thinking to land at some better quarter: the Persian Generall, swore they should receive no dammage by his Army, to which when they foolishly gave beliefe to, fourscore of their heads were forthwith struck off, and the rest inchayned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ormuzians</HI> languishing thus long under so many sorts of afflictions, every houre hoped for delivery from <HI>Ru-Friero,</HI> but he failed them. The seventeenth day another breach was made by giving fire to sixty barrels of
<PB N="118" REF="65"/>
powder, through which the Moores entred in huge swarmes, but were beat back by eighteene Gentlemen without the Bulwark; howbeit, next day they re-entred and possessed it. The eighteenth of Aprill, two famisht renegadoes stole thence into the Camp of their Adversaries, and being brought before the Duke, confest the willingnesse of their departure, told him their expectation of supplies, together with their present miseries; assuring him, they could not endure long, death raging more furiously within the City, than the greatest forces they could oppose them with. At that report, the reanimated <HI>Persian</HI> againe beseiges her, intending the next breach to enter pellmell amongst them: which when the <HI>Portugall</HI> saw, and no safety any way appearing; the three and twentieth day (know∣ing no faith in the Mahomitans) they yeelded the Castle, and their trea∣sure unto the English; only craving of them that they might receive their lives, and be conveyed safely to <HI>Muskat</HI> in <HI>Arabia:</HI> the English assent, and very nobly transported three thousand of them, and entended like favour to the rest; but the envious <HI>Persian</HI> suddenly intercepted above three hundred <HI>Arabs</HI> halfe Christians, and <HI>Portugals:</HI> whom without par∣ley or any signe of pitty, contrarie to their oath and honour, they behead∣ed; and sent their heads to <HI>Gombroon</HI> for a Trophae, and as an assured signal of their conquest and blameworthy fury. After this, by unanime assent, the Magazeens of armour, victualls and treasure were sealed up with the signets of both Nations: the interim was imployed in massacring of more than halfe dead men, violating women, polluting Temples, and defacing verie brave and gallant houses; during which, an unworthie English man (contrarie to the order) breaks into a forbidden Monasterie stuft with riches, and in his returne is discried by the ratling of his burthensome sa∣criledge; at which the Persians flie to the Duke, and by consent break asunder everie thing was valuable, (the English all that time dreaming of no such accident) bus when it was known, much discourse intervened on both sides, but the Pagans accounted words but ayre, and seeing their de∣signes accomplished, made the fury and anger of the English meere pro∣vocatives of scorne and laughter: the Enlish had no more than twentie thousand pounds paid them for their service. The brasse Ordnance in the Castle and Rampires were divided, some say they were three hundred, others as many moe: Howbeit, our men say there were only fifty three great brasse peeces mounted, foure brasse cannon, six brasse demicannon, sixteen cannon pedroes of brasse, and one of iron, 9 culverin of brasse, two demiculverin of brasse, three of iron, ten brasse bases, seven brasse bastels, some basilisks of 22 foot long, and nintie two brasse peeces unmounted; which I the rather name, in that the Portugalls bragge they had small de∣fence, and few Ordnance; with either of which if they had beene fur∣nished, <HI>Ormus</HI> had never beene triumphed over. Those belonging to the Persian were transported to other Cittadells, to <HI>Gombroon, Larr, Shyraz, Hispahan,</HI> and <HI>Babylon.</HI> The King of <HI>Ormus, Seid Mahumet shaw,</HI> was made prisoner to the <HI>Persian,</HI> and at this day is at <HI>Shyraz</HI> under an allow∣ance of five markes a day; his other pension (during his prosperity paid him by the Portugalls) amounted yeerely to a hundred and forty thou∣sand ryalls. The Town at this day is wholly ruinous, the Castle excepted,
<PB N="119" REF="65"/>
which aspect keepes her former beauty, strength, and greatnesse, and is owned by the Persian.</P>
<P>As for the common Mariners, they found enough to throw away; by that little they got, shewing their luxurie, nothing but <HI>Alea, vina, Venus,</HI> in the ascendant of their devotion. Captain <HI>Woodcocks</HI> luck was best and worst; by rare chance he lighted upon a Frigot that was stealing away, loden with Pearles and inestimable treasure, above a Million of royalls for his part only; but what joy had he in that fading pelfe? pure clay is gold, who then so mad to make the earth his Idol? Whether poore (too rich) <HI>Woodcock</HI> minded more his tempting Mammon than the stearage of his ship, who can tell? but many felt by sad experience that the Whale his ship sunck close by Swally barre, the name neither of bird nor fish availing against the arrow of death, the mercilesse elements yeelding them no comfort: such catastrophes have ambition and too much greedinesse. For, but for too much pride (the Portugall upon all occasions braving the English) <HI>Ormus</HI> had stood; and but for too much avarice, who knows but the Whale might have swam still in the Ocean of security.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE tenth of Ianuary, Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> at our Ambassadors request, entred <HI>Gumbrown</HI> to acquaint the Sultan with his arrivall, and to demand such en∣tertainment and necessaries as befitted his excellen∣cy and Travaile to the Persian Court, though no lesse distant than the Caspian sea. It did not relish right to the covetous Sultan; but upon sight of his Phirman or letter of Command, he dissembled his humour, protesting he was transported with joy that so happy an occa∣sion was hapned, as well to expresse himselfe an obedient slave to <HI>Shaw-Abbas,</HI> as that the Towne should be honoured by so noble a stranger; sor∣ry onely he was so ill fitted to shew his humanity, his Lordships so sudden landing preventing the pomp he aymed him. Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> returned his complement and forthwith invited my Lord Ambassador ashoare, who as readily accepted it. At his issuing from the ship, Captaine <HI>Browne</HI> (whom I name to honour him) thundred out his farewell by a hundred great Shot, whose Ecchoes not onely made <HI>Gombroon</HI> to tremble, but seemed to rend the higher regions with their bellowings. Wrapt in smoak and flame, we landed safely, tho Neptune made us dance upon his liquid billowes and with his salt breath seasoned the Epicinia or intended Tri∣umphs. At his landing the Cannons from the Castle and Cittadell vomit∣ed out their fiery choller, ten tymes roring out their wrathfull clamours, to our delight and terrour of the Pagans, who of all noyses most hate artifi∣ciall Thunder. The Sultan and <HI>Shawbander</HI> handed him out of his Bardge, and mounted him upon a stately Arabian Courser; the stirrops were of pure gold, the saddle (a Morocco sort) was most richly imbrodered with silver. All his followers had also such as pleased them. In this equi∣page, attended by his owne gentlemen, some sea Captaines, the English Agent Master <HI>Burt</HI> and two hundred <HI>Coozell-bashawes,</HI> we moved slowly towards the Sultans Pallace, all the way passing through a ranck, or file of

Archers and Musquetiers on either side doubled, and being alighted, usherd him into his Apollo; where upon rich carpets was plac't a neat and costly Banquet, store of <HI>Shyraz</HI> Wine, and choyce Violls from the ships; all which, with his protestations of welcome, (<HI>Hoshomody Suffowardy</HI> still dropping out of his mouth) gave us undoubted knowledge that either he was a grand hypocrite, or extreamely fearefull a complaint should be made to the great Duke of <HI>Shyraz</HI> against him of his past neglect; all which we gave a favourable interpretation unto: let us now into and about the towne, to see if ought will present it selfe a welcome object.</P>
<P>GVMBROVVN (or <HI>Gomroon</HI> as some pronounce it) is by most Per∣sians <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> cald <HI>Bander</HI> or the Port Towne: seated upon the gulph, in the <HI>Carmanian</HI> desert (part whereof is now cald <HI>Larr</HI>) or in <HI>Kermoen</HI> as the Persians call it; albeit my fancie prompts me, that it is rather in <HI>Chu∣sistan, Shushan</HI> being so small a way removed from it. Some (but I com∣mend them not) write it <HI>Gamrou,</HI> others <HI>Gomrow,</HI> and other-some <HI>Cum∣meroon.</HI> The Artique pole mounts here to seven and twenty degrees and nine minutes. A Towne it is of no Antiquity, rising daily out of the ruines of late glorious (now most wretched) <HI>Ormus,</HI> an houres journey thence.</P>
<P>I was told, that it had not twelve houses twelfve yeares ago; at this day encreased to a thousand: but how can I credit it, since one <HI>Newbery</HI> our country-man entitles it a Town at his being here, which was in the yeare 1581. Yet old it cannot be, since all agree the Portugals first founded it; after <HI>Ormous</HI> doubtlesse, and where the Castle was begun but in <HI>Anno</HI> 1513 by <HI>Albuquerq'</HI> the Portugall. <HI>Gumbroon</HI> is from <HI>Ormus</HI> nine english myles: it also viewes Arabia about sixteene leagues west, for there the Gulph is narrowest. It was forced from the Portugall in the yeare 1612 by <HI>Ally-Reec</HI> the <HI>Shyrazian,</HI> and is now compleatly governed by the Persian. It is in compasse about two myles, the earth is sandy, without gardens, springs, or grasse: from March to October so hot, as the Natives flie away to <HI>Larr</HI> and other Townes where Date trees shadow them against the ever burning Sunne, and ground or sand that scalds like hottest embers: a great Mountayne (reckned twenty miles distant, but by its height seemes not eight) anticipates the coole North-wind, which to other parts breaths sweetly and refreshes them. The houses are of Sunne-dried bricks, thick &amp; sollid; within, are without much furniture; without simple to look upon. The windowes are large and trellised, made to open when any Favonius murmurs among them. The tops are tarrassed, made both to walk &amp; sleep upon, so Carpets be spred to soften them. In the Summer season when few ships ride here, they sleep in troughs or beds fild with water. The Buzzar is very ordinary: tis covered atop to keep out the searching beames of the scortching Sunne; where under is sold Wine, Arack, Sher∣bet, Thlummery, and many other things to the eye and belly necessary. The entrance into the Sultans house, is at the East side of the Market place. His, the Shabanders, English, and Duch (distinguisht by their Flags or En∣signes, displayed by <HI>Aeolus</HI> atop their houses) are all are worth the entring in or my noting: of best note, are two Castles, at the North and South ends of the Towne, spatious and defensive; adorn'd with good Battlements and
<PB N="122" REF="67" MS="y"/>
Platformes to play their uselesse Cannons on. Fourescore brasse Peeces are planted here, and are part of those they got from <HI>Ormus Anno</HI> 1622; two hundred more being sent up to <HI>Larr, Spahawn</HI> and <HI>Babylon</HI>) of small ter∣rour, if no better Gunners exercise them. Whiles ships ride here, <HI>Gum∣broon</HI> is a garrison foure hundred horse and foot attend their Gene∣rall; but dare not fight against the Sonne, all summer billeting where they can find food and shelter. In winter you may find here, Merchants of sundry Nations; English, Ducth, Persians, Indians, Arabs, Armenians, Turks, Iewes, and others. The most common commodities here, are belly food; Wine, Rack, Sherbet, Rosewater, Sugar, Almonds, Dates, Pomgra∣nats, Figs, Currans, Orenges, Lemmons, Pomecitrons, Mirabolans, Ap∣ples, Peares, Quinces, and Flowers, in great variety. As also, Goates, Hens, egges (two yeare old,) Ryce, &amp;c. most of which are sold by the crafty, faire spoken <HI>Bannyans,</HI> who swarme through all parts of Asia. They will readily trade or prattle with Christian, Turk, Iew, or Gentile, but have no good fellowship, for they hate to eat or drink with any save of their owne casts and religion; rice, plaintains, and some fruits they eat, drink water or sherbet (which is faire water, rosewater, sugar and juyce of Lemons put together): but for flesh, eggs, or such roots, as raddish and the like, resembling blood or wine, not one bitt would they eat, though you would give the poorest knave amongst them, a thousand pound; they are troubled with <HI>Pythagoras</HI> dreames, doubting thereby they might eat up the soules of their friends or parents; which transmigration of soules <HI>Tibullus</HI> elegantly thus detects to his Mistresse.</P>

<P>Some Sudatories (cald here Hummums,) some Mosques, some Syna∣gogues and Sanhedrins are here; but those so obscure, that the eye can scarce direct us to them. Most remarkable is the great <HI>Banayan</HI> Tree, a league East from the Towne, and opposite to <HI>Ormus</HI> Castle: a Tree (or rather twenty Trees, the boughs rooting and springing up a whole aker together rounded within and shaded in forme of a Theater, two hundred and nine paces about as I measured and wherein, or under, may ambush very secretly three hundred horse: some call it the arched Fig tree, some <HI>Arbor de Rays,</HI> (a tree of Roots) others <HI>de Goa:</HI> namd by us the <HI>Bannyan</HI> Tree, from their adorning and adoring it with ribbons and streamers of va∣ricoloured Taffata, a goodly Diety! such a one as <HI>Pliny</HI> observd long since in his Travayles amongst 'em. <HI>Haec fuere Numinûm Templa, priscoque ritu, etiam nunc simplicia rura Deo praecellentem Arborem dicant.</HI> Here under

also, they have a temple, supported on one side by the body of the tree, un∣seen to such as are without the branches; in which (for I adventured in) are three of the most deformed Pagods or Idols imaginable; invocated by the Bannyan in memoriall of <HI>Cuttery, shuddery,</HI> and <HI>Wyse,</HI> their three dei∣fied predecessors; kept by an old doting Braminy, who for above three∣score yeeres in this irreligious place has most wickedly sacrifizd his soule to <HI>Belzebub;</HI> for many yeeres hee had all the Pagods offerings, part being the virginity of the Brides (at ten yeeres commonly) which since he can∣not actuate, he is not asham'd (as I was told) to contract with Travellers, who in an infernall disguise reap the unripe and unholy Holocausts.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants (I exclude strange Merchants) are Olive-coloured, white onely in their teeth: their apparell is a shash above, a Shuddero or linnen about their waists, and else-where naked. They cut their skin,

with such like gingadoes, some which are looking-glasses to admire them∣selves (rare beauties) in; their armes and legges are laden with voluntary shackles of brasse and Ivory: in their noses they put their most pretious Jewels; brouches of gold, set with Garnats, Emralds, Turquoises, and like stones of value: and with it, other round Rings headed with ragged pearle, such as with their intollerable impudence makes me say, they are the most nasty, pocky Whores you shall find in any place, and who very fitly comply with <HI>Ovids</HI> remedy of love.</P>
<P>To concomitate those carrion women, take notice of those troopes of Jackalls, which here more than any other where rally themselves, not only each night committing burglary in the Town, but commonly they teare the dead out of their graves, and with a vulture appetite devoure their carcasses; all the while ululating and in offensive noises barking and ecchoing out their sacriledge. Wee made good sport to hunt them with doggs and swords, but they are too many to be banisht, too unruly to be conquered. I take them for those the Romans call'd <HI>Crocutae,</HI> the Greeks <HI>Alopecidae,</HI> or <HI>Lyciscae</HI> (<HI>Multum latrante Lycisca</HI>) and are either an unnaturall mixture of a Bitch and Fox, or doggs from <HI>Europe;</HI> by diver∣sity of ayre and soile varying in <HI>specie</HI> from what they were formerly; observ'd in other things; the Indian Ounces, what be they but extract from Cats of <HI>Europe?</HI> Spanish doggs, in new <HI>Spaine,</HI> in the second litter doe they not become Wolves? good Melons being also transplanted in∣to a base and barren ground, turne quickly to ordinary Cowcumbers.</P>
<P>Fourteene dayes are past since we entred <HI>Gombroon;</HI> the place has no such Magick to perswade us to inhabit here. Our end is travell, why stay we then? sure, wee were stayed three dayes by the Sultans superstition, who upon casting the Dice, if the chance prov'd right, would let us goe; if wrong, <HI>nigro carbone notatus.</HI> The foure and twentieth day the Die was right, and wee were mounted; our little Carravan consisted of twelve horse and 29 Camells: the English Agent and other of our owne, and some Dutch Merchants attended our Ambassadour a league out of the Towne; where, the Sultan met us, who (well pleas'd with the Piscash or Present our Ambassador had given him) payed us all a hundred <HI>Sallams</HI> and <HI>Tesselams:</HI> that is, God speed you well, God keepe you. And lifting up his eyes to heaven, his hands to his breast, and bending almost unto his stirrop, once more bad farewell &amp; so returned. His men &amp; he all the way back played at <HI>Giochi di Canni,</HI> darting at one another very dexterously. Wee heard the King was solacing at the Caspian Sea, whither now wee are travelling. Till then let us keepe an <HI>Ephemerides</HI> or day-journey. The first night (from <HI>Gumbroon</HI>) wee rode to <HI>Bandally,</HI> sixteene English miles (and most part along the gulph) or to compute it in the Persian tongue, five farsangs and a halfe; a farsang (<HI>Pliny</HI> calls it a <HI>parasang</HI> which containes thirty stades or foure Italian miles) is three of ours, or a Dutch league; in names only different. At <HI>Band Ally</HI> we found a neat <HI>Carravans-raw</HI> or <HI>Inne,</HI> the Turks call them <HI>Imareths,</HI> the Indians <HI>Sarrays;</HI> built by mens charity, to give all civill passengers a resting place <HI>gratis;</HI> to keepe them from the injury of theeves, beasts, weather, &amp;c: for, through all <HI>Asia</HI> we find no other receptories, nor provision save what we carry along,
<PB N="125" REF="68" MS="y"/>
and Kitchin utensils to dresse it in; also wee have our water usually in Tancks or Store-houses, some made long, some round, pav'd below; above, archt and plaistered; fill'd by the beneficiall raynes (springs are rarely found) which albeit the clouds seldome here distill their happy moisture, they somtimes breake, and then in churlish sort diffude to some purpose; for, falling in Cattaracts they quickly fill their gaping Jarrs and Cesterns. Next night wee got to <HI>Gacheen,</HI> five farsangs further; the third night to <HI>Cowrestan,</HI> seven; next, to <HI>Tanghy-Dolon</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> a narrow way) praise-worthy in her Lodge or Carravans-raw, but especially in the sweet Crystallin water wee found there. It issues from a mighty mountain three miles East thence, and in an <HI>Aquae-duct</HI> sports wantonly to this Tanck, whose over plus is received (by another Pipe laid in an artificiall way cut mar∣vellously through the bottome of an adjoyning rockie hill) into a large Pond; which, richly mellowes all the Vally (resembling <HI>Tempe</HI>) and Town call'd <HI>Dolon,</HI> surrounded with studpendious hills on every side, so per∣pendicular, as with few men may bee made impregnable; a solitary place it is, but exceeding pleasant; when from the hill tops wee dazell our sights in view of that sandy, stony, sterill Desert. That dayes journey was foure farsangs.</P>
<P>Our next daies travell was to <HI>Whormoot,</HI> eleven farsangs (thirty three miles) where we found a black pavillion; in it three old Arabians; who, out of their Alcoran ingeminated a dolefull requiem to their Brothers carcasse, over which they sat; their lookes were clouded with pathetick sadnesse; their cheekes bedewed with briny teares, intending (after the Jewish mode, <HI>Septem ad luctum</HI>) to solemnise his farewell seven daies, singing, sighing, weeping.</P>

But, though the savour bee so base, the sapor is so excellent, that no meat, no sauce, no vessell pleases the Guzurats pallat, save what relishes of it. Next night we got to <HI>Our-mangell,</HI> five: and next day to <HI>Larr;</HI> two miles short of which old City, the <HI>Cawzy, Calantar</HI> and other of the prime Citizens welcomed us with wine and other adjuncts of complement. Wee had not rode halfe a mile further, when, loe an antick Persian out of a Poetick rapture, clamored out a song of welcome: the Epilog was resounded upon kettle Drums, Timbrells, and Barbarrous Jingle-jangling instruments; a homely <HI>Venus</HI> attired like a <HI>Bacchanell,</HI> attended by many other morisdancers, begun to caper and frisk their best lavoltoes; every limb strove to exceed each other, the Bells, brasse Cimbals, kettle musick and whistles, storming such a Phrygick discord, that to consort we might squeak'out.</P>

<P>LARR, is a City and Province in <HI>Persia;</HI> on the North limited with <HI>Parc</HI> or <HI>Pharsistan;</HI> on the East with <HI>Carmoan</HI> or <HI>Carmania;</HI> has the Per∣sian gulph to the South; and to the West, <HI>Chusistan</HI> or <HI>Susiana;</HI> a region a thousand miles in circuit: barren and flaming hot, full of sand, stones, a few Date trees, Mines, and sulphur.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Lar</HI> is in the navell of <HI>Larestan,</HI> and raises the North pole seven and twenty degrees and forty minutes; some have more, twenty eight degrees and thirtie minutes, in longitude from the cape Meridian ninty degrees: a very old City it is; if call'd <HI>Laodicaea</HI> by <HI>Antiochus,</HI> as <HI>Pine∣tus</HI> thinkes, (in <HI>Phrygia</HI> and <HI>Coelosyria</HI> were Townes of the same name in <HI>Ptolomy</HI>) <HI>Procopolis</HI> by another Greek; <HI>Corrha</HI> after that, and now <HI>Lar</HI> (or <HI>Laar</HI> as some pronounce it) a name given her foure hundred yeeres ago by <HI>Laarge-beg,</HI> sonne of <HI>Phiroe,</HI> and grandsonne to <HI>Pilaes,</HI> after whom ruled <HI>Gorgion Melec</HI> (of whom their <HI>Cabala</HI> feigns wonders) to whom fol∣lowed eighteen Kings, of whom <HI>Ebrahim-cawn</HI> was last, subjected (<HI>Anno</HI> hegirae 985. of ours 1605) by a stratagem <HI>Emangoli-cawn</HI> Duke of <HI>Shy∣raz</HI> overthrew him by, to satiate the hungry ambition of <HI>Abbas</HI> his Master, and (which is rare considering the great poverty of his Country) for the Kings part loaded away with treasure seven hundred Cammells. The captiv'd King <HI>Ebrahim</HI> had his life and a noble pension promist him, hee enjoyed them but awhile, an unexpected sword of death betraying his hopes, without which the Dyadem sat not right upon the head of <HI>Shaw-Abbas</HI> the soveraigne,</P>
<P>Nine dayes we staid in <HI>Larr;</HI> a shame it were, if in so long time we had noted nothing. <HI>Lar</HI> is from <HI>Gumbroon</HI> seven small dayes riding; from <HI>Shyraz</HI> foureteene, from <HI>Babylon</HI> twenty: a very poore Towne it is, as being parcht with the scalding Sun, defaced by rage of warre, and thrown down by many fearfull Earth-quakes. <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1400, it shook ter∣ribly, and made five hundred houses prostrate to its Tiranny. <HI>Anno</HI> 1593. of their account 973. she boasted of five thousand houses; but see how vain: is the pride of man: that very yeere, the earth sweld with such a dreadfull tympany, that in venting it selfe, it made all <HI>Larr</HI> to quake; and in fine, would not be supprest, but by the weight of three thousand houses turned topsi-turvie, quashing to death three thousand men in their de∣struction. The old Castle also on the East side of the Towne (it owes its foundation to <HI>Georgean Melec</HI>) though built atop a solid rock, groand in a like affrighting downfall: and to me it seemed strange, a City so strong∣ly, so surely founded, should be so subject to such unnaturall commotions. Whither it be (as <HI>Democritus</HI> dreamt) from the gaping Sun-torne earth quaffing in too greedily too much water, and (like a glutted drunkard)

overcharging her caverns, vomits it up in a forcible and discontented mo∣tion; or whether (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> teaches) from vapors ingendred in the bowels of the earth, and loth to bee imprisoned in a wrong orb, rends its passage by a viperous horrid motion: or whether from subterranean fires, the ayre inflamed upon sulphur, or such exuberances of nature, I dare not conclude, but leave such theories to those that study Meteors. Let us therefore see what <HI>Larr</HI> now is.</P>
<P><HI>Larr,</HI> the Metropolis of this Province, is not wald about; in that, Art is needlesse, the lofty rocks on East and North so naturally defend her: besides, a brave Castle at the North quarter (mounted upon an imperious hill) not only threatens an enemy, but awes the Towne in a frownig posture: the ascent is narrow and steep: the Castle of good stone: the walls are furnisht with usefull battlements: whereon are mounted twelve brasse cannon pedroes, and two basilisks (the spoiles of <HI>Ormus:</HI>) within the Castle wall are raisd a hundred houses, stored with men, most part soldatts, who have there a gallant Armory able to furnish with Lance, Bow, and Gun, three thousand men: it is a fort without, of a stately frame: within, is no lesse commendable: the <HI>Buzzar</HI> is also a gallant fabrick; the materiall is good chalkie stone; long, strong, and beautifull: a quadrant I cannot call it, the sides are so unequall: tis cover'd atop, archt, and (in piazza sort) a kinde of Burse; wherein each shop showes ware of severall qualities: the Alley from North to South, is 170 of my paces; from East to West, a hundred and sixty; the ovall in center is about a hundred and ninty: a building (to speak of the Asiaticks) in some hundreds of miles, scarce to be parrelled. Neere this <HI>Buzzar</HI> are coyned the Larrees, a fa∣mous sort of money, shap'd like a long Date stone, the Kings name stampt upon pure silver, in our money valuing ten pence.</P>
<P>The Mosques here bee not many; one especiall Mosque (or Deer) it has, round (either shadowing out Aeternity, or from a patterne of the <HI>Alca∣ba</HI> the holy Temple in Mecca, whose shape they say <HI>Abraham</HI> had from heaven) in some part varnisht with Arabick letters, and painted knots, gar∣nisht in other parts with Mosaick fancies: tis low, and without glasse win∣dowes, wodden trellizes (excellently cut after their invention) supplying them: the entrance is through a brazen gate, neer which is hung a Mirrour whether to admire their tallow faces in, or internal deformities, I know not: some lamps it also has, for use and ornament: some Prophets rest their bones here, take one for all. <HI>Emeer-Ally-zedday-ameer,</HI> a long-namd-long-bon'd (if his grave bee right) long since rotten Prophet; the older Prophet, the fresher profit; zeale and charity oft times worship antiquity: but how can I credit them that he was a Mahometan; they say (if that will not please, they sweare) hee died a thousand five hundred yeeres ago, six hundred yeeres before <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and yet a Mussulman: their faith admits no questions nor answers, or if it did, wee will not trouble it: For I see variety of good fruit close by, to which I have a better appetite; here are the fairest Dates (Dactills in Latin from their finger like shape) Orenges, Lemons, &amp; Pomcitrons you find in <HI>Persia;</HI> if those will not please, you buy here at easie rates, Goats, Hens, Rice, Rach, and Aquavitae: but for their water (wee drest our meat with it, the people drink it) they call it
<PB N="128" REF="70"/>
Ob-baroon which in the language of <HI>Persia</HI> signifies rain-water: but with farre more reason I may call it <HI>Aqua-Mortis;</HI> death seeming to bubble in it. A base qualified water it is; whether that their Tancks or Magazeens are ill made, or nastily kept, and by that the water is corrupted; or whe∣ther the raine of it selfe is insalubrious and loathsome I cannot tell; but both it may bee makes it so bad as it is; so unsapory, so ill to the gust, as worse water for taste, and especially for property can scarce be relished: as little of it came in my belly as could be borrowed from extremity of thirst; and I suppose I had good reason to forbeare it: for, it causes Catarrhs, breeds sore eyes, ulcerates the guts, and which is more terrible than the raest, it ingenders small long worms in the legges of such as use to drink it; and, which sort of vermin is not more loathsome to look upon, than painfull to the itching disease of them that breed 'em; by no potion, no unguent, to bee remedied: they have no other way to destroy them, save by rowling them about a pin or peg, not unlike the treble of a Theorbo; the most danger being this, that if in the screwing the worme chance to break, it makes them very dolefull Musick, for it endangers the leg, apt to gangreen and (but by lancing) hardly curable. The water is the natu∣rall cause of this strange malady: and seemes to mee to bring the venome from the region where tis generated; for, commonly the clouds here at <HI>Larr</HI> are undigested (as in the Tornadoes I have formerly spoken of) and unagitated by the wind; Nor do the clouds distill their raine in drops as is usuall in colder regions, but in whole and violent irruptions; dange∣rous both in the fall, and no lesse hurtfull in the using.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are most part naked and merit as naked a relation: they are a mixture of Jewes and Mahomitans: both of them, a swarthy de∣formed generation: for generally in this City they are blear-eyd, rotten tooth'd, and mangy legd: the violent heat and poysonous waters causes it: the habit of the greater part of them is only a wreath of Callico tyed about their heads; their mid-parts are circled with a Zone of vari-colo∣red plad, and have Sandalls upon their feet, elsewhere being naked: some indeed have shashes of silke and gold, tulipanted about their heads; they roab themselves in coats or Cabays of Satten, and especially inrich their fin∣gers with rings of silver set with Turqueises or Cornelians, and in which they affect to have ingraven their owne name, or some selected posie out of the Alcoran: upon their thumb they commonly weare a ring of horne which makes the arrowes go off strong and easily: their crooked swords also afford them no small delight, the blades being exceeding good, the hilts no lesse valuable; for they are of gold: In this City should bee a river and that not a small one, if our Geographick Maps were true; but they erre egregiously, for here not only is no river, but also none else is to bee found in a hundred miles travell, go which way you will: for both by in∣quiring of many Persians &amp; our own experience in further travell, I could neither heare of nor see any neerer us than <HI>Tabb,</HI> famous in her sepa∣rating <HI>Susiana</HI> from <HI>Carmania;</HI> and from <HI>Larr,</HI> westward about 5 small daies journey hence: or that other of <HI>Cyre,</HI> over which we rode twixt <HI>Shyraz</HI> and old <HI>Persepolis:</HI> some small brooks wee rode over; but rivers no man must dare to call them, since none of them in bredth or depth exceed 3 foot.</P>

These Jewes (or Jehuds as the Persians call them) are a remnant of those foure Tribes, <HI>Salmanassar</HI> son to <HI>Tyglath Pilezer</HI> the Assyrian King forc't from <HI>Samaria Anno Mundi</HI> 3220. placing them in <HI>Hala, Hara</HI> and <HI>Ghabor</HI> (by the river <HI>Gozan</HI>) Cities of the Medes: the Towne (I do but imagine so) is named from <HI>Iaarim</HI> a memo∣rable Towne in <HI>Canaan:</HI> they have some Sinagogues, but no high Priests; the Mosaicall Law they have wonderfully corrupted: they are to this day a hardharted subtle people; very cowardly, rich, but odious to all other religions: most remarkable, is a precious liquor or Mummy growing here, Mumnaky-koobas they call it, a liquor which none dare take, for all is carefully lookt to for the King. It distills (in June only) from the top of those stupendious Mountaines, every yeere about five ounces: a moist redolent gumme it is, soveraign against all sorts of poyson; and (if we may beleeve them) a Catholicon for all wounds and most diseases: when other Princes send this King presents of gold, pearle, or other costly devices; he sends them back, a little of this Balsome, as a full remuneration. These Mountaines are famosed in story; After <HI>Alexander</HI> had preyed and sacri∣ficed in <HI>Susa</HI> (betrayd by <HI>Abulites</HI> a time-serving Satrapa) he led his wanton Army towards <HI>Persepolis;</HI> his neerest passage was over these hills of <HI>Ia∣arown</HI> (in those dayes cald <HI>Pilae Persidis</HI> and <HI>Susaidae</HI>) where to his amaze∣ment, he was so beaten by <HI>Ariobarzanes</HI> a Martialist and his small company, that (contrary to the pace and honour of the worlds Monarch) he was constrain'd to retreat apace, and shamefully to avoyd that thundering storme of stones and arrowes.</P>
<P>The eleventh of February we left <HI>Larr, Codges-Obdruzy</HI> the Governor furnished us (to <HI>Shyraz</HI>) with Mules, very poore ones; the Asses they return'd upon: no matter. Mules are Emblems of sobriety; our Harbinger (or Mammandore in Persian) was an honest Cozelbash, and would be sure, (hopefull of some reward, and because his part lay therein) at every place where we made our Manzeel or rest, to provide us good lodging, and such meat as the country would affoord us: by vertue of his authority do∣mineering over the wretched Rusticks more than pleased us; he would proffer them a little mony for what he liked; if they refused to take it, he took it then by force, and Alla Soldado payd them in big words and basti∣nadoes: in miserable slavery the pesants live; a soldiers life is here the most honourable and safest. The first night we pitcht our Tents not far from <HI>Larr,</HI> but were stopt next day by an immoderate flood of raine, that made the earth so slippery, as our Cammells glib-hoofes could not foot it; the raine falls seldome here, but when it comes, they both feele and heare it: some times it raises such a Deluge as sweeps men and houses away; six yeeres ago (in this place) a Caravan of two thousand Camels perisht by the fury of it. The foureteenth day wee rode to <HI>Deachow</HI> (or <HI>Techoo</HI>) which signifies a Towne under a hill; where we see many prettie Tombs, not any without his grave-stone and an Arabick memoriall. The Alcoran commands that none be buried in Cities, for feare the noysome Carcasses

infect the living, but in a Gemitery nigh the most publique highway; that by viewing the Sepulchers of the dead (the Romans did the like, the Ae∣gyptians had them in their banquetting houses) they might contemplate their mortality. A mile from this Towne we view'd threescore black Pa∣villions; black without; within full of female beauties: the Persians call them Vloches; the Arabs, Kabilai; the Turq'stans and Armenians, Taiphae; the Tartars, Hoords; the Antients, Nomades; of whom the Poet thus:

<P>Vertue, the Trophy of a refin'd ambition, is purchased by embracing the excellent and wholsome Notions of an humble soule, of a well-temper'd spirit, whose heavenly radiance respects no other object with delight save vertue, from which pure streame flowes Moderation, to whose excellen∣cie (next to spirituall sacrifice) wee may safely devote our best endevours. So apt to every immodest Act, is mans corrupt disposition, that to enjoy sensuality he conceits vertue (though never so gorgeously arrayed) foule and deformed: till moderation force him to a strict account, and discover how much he erred, in preferring intemperance before the transcendent qualities of a vertuous life: and from whence, when we contemplate the contented life and poverty of these Vloches, needs must wee condemne our selves of lothsome ryot. For, how free from unseasonable care, pale Envie, affrighting Tumult, and nasty surfet doe these enjoy themselves; happy Conquerors! how mutually doe they accord, how joyfully satiate Nature, in what is requirable.

<P>To returne; so soone as <HI>Phoebus</HI> had runne thrice fifteene degrees in our Hemisphere, we mounted our melancholly Mules, and made our next Manzeel at <HI>Berry.</HI> Nothing was observable in the way, save a huge thick wall, of great length and height, cut by infinite toyle out of the sollid rock, to safeguard the <HI>Larians</HI> from the <HI>Shyrazians, Larr</HI> in that place termi∣nating.</P>
<P><HI>Berry</HI> is a small Village; it promises much at distance, but when there, deludes the expectation: yet is it famous through the Persian Territories, both from the prerogatives an ancient learned Syet endued it with, con∣firmed by all succeeding Princes; and from an Arabick Schoole, distin∣guisht into classes, of the civill Law, Astrologie, Physick, and such as leads to <HI>Mecca:</HI> commendable in their Pythagorean silence, learning to discourse by wincks, nods, and such dumb notions; for babling is in all Arabick Schooles wonderously hated: they also observe two rules especially, obe∣dience, and moving the body too &amp; fro in reading: adjoyning this Schoole,

is a Deer or Mosquit, a venerable place, chiefly by being a Dormitory to their greatest Doctor <HI>Emawm-zeddey-a meer-a maddy-Ally,</HI> a Prophets sonne, and allyed to holy <HI>Ally;</HI> in this grave enjoying (say they) eight hun∣dred yeeres rest; a great antiquity. His Tomb is rais'd foure foot from the pavement, is eight foot long, covered with a white fine linnen cloth; the Tomb-stones are carved and painted with knots and poesies of Arabick; neere him are fixt two Lances to memorize his quondam profession, and some Ensignes not of ordinarie invention: Vpon his Coffin lie a set of goodly Beads, to help his devout memorie, and which to this day retaine their Masters vertue of working miracles. Atop the Chappell is a globe (or steele mirrour) pendant, wherein these Linx-eyed people view the deformity of their sinnes. They also shewed us a square stone pearced and hung neere the wall, a rare stone, a relique most notorious! the Prophet used to burthen the backs of impenitent sinners with it, telling them their impiety made it seeme heavie, a waight so ponderous as made them take the right path to be quit of it. A little pot comes next to our description, holding a soveraigne unguent made eight hundred yeeres since, oft us'd, and never exhausted: and is not only good to help sore eyes, but a <HI>Panacea</HI> against all diseases; to crowne all, his booke (no Alfurcan of devotion) is layd upon his carcasse; any body is suffered to see it a far off, but to touch it is counted a presumption, the impure breath of man peradventure infe∣cting it: in stormes and crosses they finde remedy with only naming it: the Church is neatly matted, a Mosque of so much holinesse, that none must enter with boots or shooes on: such as want issues (I meane not in their leggs) health, wealth, friends, or the like, upon their offring shall have satisfaction. The Oracle (the Priest) never cheats them. <HI>Sed non ego credulus illis:</HI> and with that I bid <HI>Berry</HI> farewell.</P>
<P>Next night wee got to <HI>Bannarow.</HI> The last Towne feasted us with Tra∣ditions, this with good cheare, musick, three kettle drummes, and six dumb Musquets. The ruines of an ancient Castle (demolisht lately by the Persian) shewes its ribs, through which the coole ayre blowes, seldome failing from the top of that stupendious Mountaine: one side of the Castle wall is anatomized to the Town, the other to the stony Desart. Next night we lay in <HI>Goyeme,</HI> bragging in a thousand rotten houses. After we had re∣pos'd an houre, a Hocus-pocus affronted us, and performed rare tricks of Activity. I remember some of them. He trod upon two slicing hooked Semiters with his bare feet, then layd his naked back upon them, suffering a heavie Anvill to be layd on his belly, and two men to hammer out foure horshooes on it very forceably. That trick ended, he thrust his armes and thighes thorow with many Arrowes and Lances; then, by meere strength of his block-head he lift up a yard from the ground a great stone, weighing six hundred pound, and (as if hee had done nothing) knit his haire to an old Goats head, and with a scornfull pull tore it asunder, at that crying out <HI>Allough-whoddaw i.e.</HI> God help him; the standers by with a loud yell, ap∣plauded him: we gave him particular thanks, and told him he was a pret∣tie fellow. But what was hee? to speake of <HI>Marius</HI> (one of the thirty Ty∣rants) who with one of his fingers could overthrow a loaded Wayne: or of <HI>Polydamas,</HI> who with one hand would hold a wild Bull by his hinder
<PB N="132" REF="72" MS="y"/>
legg, and in despight of his best force stop him, as <HI>Cael. Rhod.</HI> and <HI>Treb. Pollio</HI> have it. But in remembring these, I had almost forgot to tell you, that in <HI>Goyeom,</HI> is fairely intombed one <HI>Melec Mahomet,</HI> famous for fomenting the authority of his Master <HI>Mahomet,</HI> when the Saracens begun to canvasse it.</P>
<P>Next night we lost one another by a carelesse associating, and had a mi∣serable lodging in that vast and barren wildernesse: affording no grasse, no trees, no water, but stones and sand in great abundance, Ostriches, Storks, and Pellicans her sole Inhabitants. I beleeve the earth has worne <HI>Flora's</HI> livery; but, by the parching rage of Warre, or continued heat of the fla∣ming Sunne becomes thus miserably desart, or rather from the just wrath of Almighty God, <HI>who</HI> (as King <HI>David</HI> sings) <HI>makes a fruitfull land barren, for the ungodlinesse of them that dwell therein.</HI> Next day wee quested in search of our Carravan, and with much trouble recovered it: that night also pitching in the Desart, were welcom'd by such a sudden storm of rain, thunder, and lightning, as made our cheare more wretched, imprisoning us also in our Tents. Next day, wee had the weather comfortable, the sight of a few Date and Mastick tree, refreshing us; confuting <HI>Coriats</HI> con∣ceit, that Mastick is found no where but in <HI>Syo.</HI> By the way we tooke no∣tice of an od-devis'd Tomb (it inhum'd a harmlesse Shepheard) hung to and fro with threds tripartite (it may be, shadowing out the Trinity) each thred beautified with party-coloured wooll, at each end a Puppet to pro∣tect it, some Cypresses were added to condecorate and to revive the old Idoll ceremony.</P>

<P>The next (the two and twenty of February) by the way we had some sport in dislodging a wild Bore, but neither shot nor dogs reaching him we made <HI>Cut-bobbo</HI> our <HI>manzeil; Mohack</HI> our next (in which are buried <HI>Ma∣homet, Hodge, Izmael,</HI> and <HI>Ally,</HI> foure great <HI>Mussulmannish</HI> Doctors, in∣tombd here 400 yeares ago, resorted to with no small reverence.) Next day to <HI>Coughton,</HI> to <HI>Vnghea</HI> next, thence to <HI>Moyechaw,</HI> next day to <HI>Pully-pot-shaw</HI> (leaving <HI>Bobbaw-hodgee</HI> on our left hand) next night pitching a farsangh short of <HI>Shiraz;</HI> where we expected a ceremonious entrance: but seeing none came out to meet us, our Ambassadour (who was ever jealous of his honour) sent his <HI>Mammandar</HI> to the Governour, (the great Duke was hauking fifty myles thence, of purpose absent,) to demand fresh horses and a befitting welcome. The <HI>Daraguad</HI> in person came to dissem∣ble, first excusing his Lord the Duke, who would go neer to kill him for not acquainting him with this excellent Advantage to manifest his inte∣grity unto our Nation, in comparison of whom all other in the world were odious. In a word (perceiving our haste) he humby beseecht his Lordship to practize but three dayes patience, till the great Duke might honour his entrance, and display his radiance; a favour of a double reflex, in that it would infinitely content their Governour, and accumulate an incomparable splendor and triumph to his entrance, closing his hypocrisie with an if not, he was then prest to usher his Lordship to his lodging.
<PB N="133" REF="72"/>
The Ambassador easily descryed him to be a <HI>Synon,</HI> sent meerly to betray his credulity: so as perceiving no remedy, the twilight helping his silent passage (<HI>Apollo</HI> had already drencht his fiery tramels in maddame <HI>Thetis</HI> lapp, <HI>Cynthia</HI> also lookt pale, as displeasd with so much knavery) we joggd leasurely on upon our Portugall Trumpetters, who (so soone as they wind∣ed the smoak and ayre of this excellent Citty,) spared the Persians a labour in their brasse pans, hoboyes and such Phrygick Musique, sometimes bray∣ing out, at other tymes ecchoing to one another in their Mymallonian Cornets, as if some Orgies to <HI>Liber Pater</HI> had been solemnizing: in so much as many ran out of doores, others fired their flambeauxes to know the cause and glut their wonder. After long circling we arrivd at <HI>Shock-Ally-Begs</HI> Pallace (the Dukes substitute) where our Lord was wearied with a prolix Apologie, and then made to taste a Banquet of dainties. After which they convoyd us to <HI>Ally-chan,</HI> a neat house at the East end of the City, belonging to the King, incompast with as brave Gardens and as spa∣cious as most in <HI>Asia.</HI> And now the vexation is past, why do we make it an indignity, as if Nocturnall entries had not equall lustre with the day; the Artificiall light we had (for ought you know) might eclipse the splen∣dor of the starry firmament. <HI>Holofernes</HI> chose the night to make a tri∣umphant entrance into <HI>Damas.</HI> Proud <HI>Antiochus</HI> took the same time into <HI>Hierusalem, Augustulus</HI> into <HI>Rome,</HI> and haughty <HI>Sapores,</HI> into this very City. Let us now triffle no longer, but view the City.</P>
<P>SHERAZZ (so they pronounce it) the pleasantest of Asiatique Cities, is removed from the Aequator nine and twenty degrees, forty minutes, and in longitude 88 degrees. By <HI>Ben Ionas</HI> (500 yeares ago) cald <HI>Syaphaz,</HI> by <HI>Corn. de Iudaeis Sitas</HI> and <HI>Sivas,</HI> by <HI>Osorius Xiraz,</HI> by <HI>Raleigh Siras,</HI> by <HI>Stephanus Cyrecbatha,</HI> by <HI>Coelius Ciropolis,</HI> a frivolous conceit, since all old Topographers place it and the river <HI>Cyrus</HI> in <HI>Hyrcania</HI> in the latitude of thirty nine degrees and a halfe: and of longitude eighty three degrees, five and forty minutes. And of that name is one in <HI>Media</HI> as <HI>Ptol.</HI> in <HI>Sogdi∣ana</HI> one neere <HI>Iaxartes</HI> as <HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> in <HI>India</HI> one, as <HI>Aelianus,</HI> a river also so called in <HI>Armenia</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> notes, but none, in <HI>Persia</HI> a <HI>Ciropolis.</HI> This name <HI>Sheraz</HI> (as I conjecture) is a derivative from <HI>Sheer</HI> (milk in the Per∣sian language) or <HI>Sherab</HI> a grape, no part of the orient shewing better or richer wine; from like reason, that <HI>Aleppo</HI> takes name from <HI>Halip</HI> milke, (and not from <HI>Alepius</HI> Leiftenant to <HI>Iulian</HI> as some dreame of) many other Townes in <HI>Persia</HI> denominating themselves from what they are abundant in, as <HI>Whormoote</HI> (a Towne of Dates.) <HI>Deachow</HI> (a hilly Towne) <HI>De-gar∣dow</HI> (a walnut Towne,) <HI>Baze-bakow, Periscow, Cutbobbaw</HI> &amp;c. or from <HI>Syra∣ses</HI> the <HI>incolae</HI> of old, as <HI>Poliaenus</HI> has it in his 8 <HI>lib. de Semiramide.</HI> Or if greek Synonymaes would carrie it, I might borrow the name from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>catena;</HI> or more properly <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>per aestum.</HI> But affectation is discommendable.</P>
<P>For albeit she be raysed from the ruines of <HI>Persepolis,</HI> that does not styg∣matize her with an upstart name, two thousand yeares being past since it was burned. I may therefore reject the peoples Cronicle, alluding her first founder to be <HI>Iamshed</HI> fift King of <HI>Persia,</HI> after whom ruld <HI>Chedorlao∣mer,</HI> not long from <HI>Noah.

<P><HI>Shiraz</HI> is distant from <HI>Ormus,</HI> one hundred and eight farsangs or three hun∣dred and foure and twenty myles English. From <HI>Larr</HI> one hundred eightie six miles, from <HI>Babylon</HI> three hundred, from <HI>Spahawn</HI> two hundred two and twenty, from the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea six hundred, from <HI>Cazbyn</HI> foure hundred and eighty six, from <HI>Periscow</HI> foure hundred and forty, from <HI>Candahor</HI> three hundred and sixtie, from <HI>Yezd</HI> two hundred and ninteeen, from <HI>Faza</HI> sixty miles English. The Antient dwellers hereabouts are named <HI>Artiatae, Tapiri, Cartii,</HI> and <HI>Orebatii.</HI> Masqued in <HI>Pare, Fure, Fares,</HI> and <HI>Farsistan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shyraz,</HI> at this day is the second City for magnificence in the Monar∣chy of <HI>Persia;</HI> watered by <HI>Bindamyr</HI> (or <HI>Bradamyr</HI>) a sweet river that drawes her descent from the <HI>Tapirian</HI> Mountaines, and after two hundred miles circling in many wanton meanders, commixing with <HI>Choaspes</HI> (now <HI>Tab</HI>) and <HI>Vlay,</HI> with them not farre from <HI>Valdac</HI> (old <HI>Shushan</HI>) lose them∣selves in the Gulph and promiscuously thence into the vast Indian Ocean.</P>
<P>It shewes some walls built by <HI>Vsan Cassan,</HI> but seems to scorne a limit∣ed bondage. It stretches from South-east to North-west, three miles; and not much lesse the other way; the compasse nine myles or there abouts: is pleasantly seated in the North-west end of a spacious plaine, twenty miles long, and six broad; circumvolved with stupendious hills, under one of which this Towne is placed. Defended by Nature, inricht by trade, by Art made lovely; the Vineyards, Gardens, Cypresses, Sudatories, and Temples, ravish the eye and smell, in every part sweet and delightfull.</P>
<P>Here Art magick was first hatched. Here <HI>Nimrod</HI> (after <HI>Babells</HI> confusion) lived and was buried. Here <HI>Cyrus</HI> (the most excellent of hea∣then Princes) was borne, and (all but his head) intombed. Here the great <HI>Macedonian</HI> glutted his Ambition and Bacchisme. Here the first <HI>Sybilla</HI> sung our Saviours incarnation. Hence the <HI>Magi</HI> are thought to have set forth towards <HI>Bethleem,</HI> and here a series of two hundred Kings have swayd their Scepters.</P>
<P>The houses here are of Sun-burnt-bricks, hard and durable: not very lofty; flat and tarrassed above, Belconies and the windowes curiously and largely trellized: within, spread with rich carpets; little other furniture

other where is noted. Sultan <HI>Shock-Allybegs</HI> house (where the first night we were banqueted) is inferiour to few; his dining roome was high and round and spacious. The archt roofe and side walls imbost with gold, and wrought into Imagery; so shadowed, that it was hard to judge whether imbost, inscult, or painted. The windowes were of painted glasse, the floore spred with curious Carpets. None are without their gardens, forrests rather of high Chenaers and Cypresses.</P>
<P>Fifteen Mosques professe their bravery, round (after the holy <HI>Alkaba</HI> in <HI>Mecca</HI>) til'd without, and pargetted with azure stones resembling Tur∣quoises; lined within, with pure black polisht Marble; the tops dignified by many double guilded crescents or spires which gallantly reverberate <HI>Apollo's</HI> yellow flames in a rich and delightfull splendor. Two are especially note-worthy in their Antick steeples and Mosaick curiosity. The one is square, fifty foot high in the body, leaded in some part, covered with gold and blue; the walls varnisht and wrought with knots and poesies, vast and unfurnisht (or unfinisht) within; above, spiring in two columns or pillars of wood round, cut and garnisht with great bravery, very neer as high as <HI>Paules</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> The (other) rather resembling a royall Carvans-raw) is quadrangular; the superficies of Arabique invention, imbost with gold, flagd with porphyre, painted with azure, garnished in many od mazes, and made resplendent at some solemnities by a thousand Lamps and Torches.</P>
<P>The other Mosques are not so excellent, nor yet so base as not to invite the busie eye, regarding novelties. What they want in Architecture, they supply in reliques, venerably accounted of for intombing the rotten car∣casses of some Alcorannish Doctors, whose hypocrisie have got such repute with those superstitious Ideots, that their Priests are fat, their Tombes in∣richt by superfluity of Zeale, no cost, no paines thought enough to manifest the integrity of (impious) devotion. Some sepulchers are framd of Marble, pure and shining. Others of wood, cut into Antique carving, others expresse the painters Art, and others the Sculpters skill in brasse, in plate and costly mettall. Where Art is defective, Nature (out of the treasures of darknesse) has dignified them. In one place, <HI>Shaw-meer-Ally-Hamzy</HI> a prophetique Mahomitan rests his bones, seven hundred yeares since ferried by <HI>Charon</HI> into <HI>Acheron</HI> for doating upon his deceitfull <HI>Alcaron.</HI> Threescore paces long I found the Mosque he is buried in, and in breadth just so many. In another, sleeps <HI>Sandant-Emyr-amahow</HI> contemporary with <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and equally holy; with many moe, who are like to sleep till the Trumpet raise them. Upon many of these Mosques the Storks have pyld their nests. A bird (as of the Aegyptians, so) of these people, divinely estemated.</P>

Nothing so much troubles her as want of water, yet some it has, and might have more, were the Cittisens somewhat more industrious; a gallant river (<HI>Cirus</HI> of old) for two were so named) streaming sweetly not fifteen miles thence, in the way to old <HI>Persepolis.</HI></P>
<P>At the <HI>Nowrouz</HI> or spring, the Gardens are opened for all to walk in. The women for fourteene dayes have liberty to walk, and when loose (like birds infranschisd) lose themselves in a labyrinth of wanton sports. The men also, some riding, some sitting, some walking, are all in one tune, for drinking, singing, playing, till the bottles prove empty, songs spent, and strings break, or that <HI>Morpheus</HI> lay his Caduceus over them. In all my life I never saw people more jocund, and lesse quarelsome.

<P>This brave man is a Georgian by discent, a Muslulman by profession, a Time-server for preferment: is one of those foure Tetrarchs, that under <HI>Abbas</HI> rule the Empire: his Territories reach every way welnigh six hun∣dred miles, and affoord him the Titles of Arck-Duke of <HI>Shyraz,</HI> Sultan of <HI>Larr</HI> and <HI>Iaarown,</HI> Lord of <HI>Ormus, Maqueroon, Kermoen, Chusistan, Si∣gestan</HI> and <HI>Farsistan,</HI> Prince of the gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI> and Iles there; the great Beglerbeg, commander of twelve Sultans, fifty thousand horse, slave to

<HI>Shaw-Abbas,</HI> protector of Musselmen, flower of courtesy, second in glory, Nutmeg of comfort, and Rose of delight.</P>
<P>Hee is of a miraculous descent for noblenesse (as honour goes in these parts) his father and grand-father being Dukes afore him; and which is no lesse admirable, is priviledg'd from degradation by oath from <HI>Abbas:</HI> up∣on this occasion: <HI>Aliculican</HI> his father was victorious in many pitcht bat∣tells against <HI>Turk</HI> and <HI>Tartar,</HI> adding no small lustre to <HI>Mahomet Codoban∣daes</HI> Diadem: most memorably, when (by command of <HI>Amurath</HI>) the sawcy Basha of <HI>Rhyvan</HI> with fifteene hundred musquets breath'd defiance against <HI>Morad</HI> the <HI>Chielfall</HI> governor in <HI>Armenia,</HI> for daring to side with <HI>Ismael</HI> in that famous overthrow they gave the insolent Turks, <HI>Anno</HI> 1514 in the <HI>Calderan</HI> plains. <HI>Morad</HI> thus suddenly assaulted, sends a timerous excuse, which rather inrages the Bassa, implacable till <HI>Morad</HI> had glutted his greedie appetite with burnisht gold, two thousand pound comman∣ding him thence to <HI>Nassivan</HI> (old <HI>Artaxata</HI>) by that time hungry againe. <HI>Alicolichan</HI> (<HI>Shaw Mahomets</HI> Lieftenant in <HI>Georgia</HI>) rates <HI>Morad,</HI> &amp; vows to make the Turk to eat cold Iron, meat the <HI>Basha</HI> car'd not for, but by <HI>Ally-cu∣licans</HI> fierce charge with a gallant troop of six thousand horse, made him returne his bribe, and flie as if the Devill had beene in his guts, without more prating over <HI>Anti Taurus</HI> (calld <HI>Mezis Taur</HI>) scarce thinking him∣selfe safe in any place, whiles the valiant <HI>Georgian</HI> extracted a treble summe from <HI>Morad</HI> for his levity, returning a triumphant victor to the Court, recompenced with the <HI>Sheraz</HI> Dukedome and his sonne after him, who has prov'd no lesse fortunate in <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> his field-services, having quieted <HI>Georgia,</HI> subdued <HI>Larr,</HI> part of <HI>Arabia, Diarbec,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ormus.</HI> All which it seemes is now forgotten, the young <HI>Sha-Soffy</HI> first cutting off his sonnes head the young <HI>Beglerbeg,</HI> and when the great Duke was singing to him∣selfe, <HI>Tutum me copia fecit. Anno</HI> 1632, had such another trick serv'd him, his greatnesse pressing him to destruction. But though he be dead, his ban∣quet and respect to us must not bee forgotten, <HI>Ingrato homine terra pejus nil creat;</HI> sayes <HI>Ausonius.</HI></P>
<P>At our being here, he had absented himselfe of purpose: and albeit Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> took the paines to ride to him, and tell him his error, hee answered; It was no dishonour for any man (his Master excepted) to stay his leasure: but if our Lord Ambassador had had his guard and other furniture, wee had gone away without his Licence. After six dayes at∣tendance his Greatnesse was pleasd to visit <HI>Sheraz,</HI> followed by two thousand horse, &amp; most unmanerly took his ease two dayes after, without any respect or note taking of the Ambassador. At length, he sent a gentle∣man to bid him come and visit him, returning with this answer, hee was weary having come a great journey, and that his businesse was to see his Master, hee knew not him. The Duke storms to be so slighted, but durst not affront him, (knowing the King had commanded his whole Kingdome to honour and bid him heartily welcome) so after some pause, sent word he meant next day to visit him; but faild in his promise, his sonne the Beglerbeg (eighteene yeere old) being sent to excuse him. Next day, our Ambassador sent word by <HI>Shoc-Ally-beg</HI> to the Dukes sonne, his visit should be retaliated. <HI>Emangoly-cawn</HI> is angry no more respect was had of him,
<PB N="138" REF="75"/>
wondring what kind of people wee were, since his owne in a sort adored him. But see how subtilly they intrapt him; for he was no sooner aligh∣ted at the Dukes Pallace, but by <HI>Shoc-Ally-beg</HI> is welcomed, and by him ushered (our Lord knew not whither) into a long gallery, rich in beauties, plate, carpets, and other furniture, where (like a Statua) the Duke himselfe at the very end sat crosse-legd, not moving one jot till the Ambassador was at him; when (as if he had beene afrighted) hee skipt up, and bad him welcome; vouchsafeing also (upon knowledge that we were gentlemen) to imbrace us, and provide us a banquet. So after two houres merriment departed, invited to returne next day to a more solemne welcome. Next day being come, wee were ushered by a Sultan thorw two great courts into a rich and stately banqueting house, a large open roome, supported with twenty richly guilded pillars, the roofe imbost with flaming gold, the ground spread with rich carpets of silke and gold, a state at one end of crimson satten, thick imbroydered with pearles and gold, under which hee was to in-throne himselfe; one side most excellently depicted his <HI>Ormus</HI> Trophyes; no cost, no Art left out to do it to the life; their incamp∣ing upon the shoare, their assaults, scaladoes, and entrance; the massacre of the Ormousians, some beheaded, some cheyn'd, some their heads ser∣ving for girdles: as also the English ships and sea skirmishes, without whose help it never had beene gained, and the like so well painted.</P>

<P>And when the greene and crimson scaenes of silke were drawne, from this <HI>Apollo,</HI> wee lookt into a great square court, which at this occasion was round beset with the prime men of the City: and into another court, where I think I told five hundred Plebeyans, invited to illustrate the Dukes magnificence.</P>
<P>Before the proud Duke meant to display his radiance: my Lord Am∣bassador was seated on the left side of the state (you may note if you please, that all <HI>Asia</HI> over, the left hand as the sword hand, is most honorable) upon the other side sat the discontented Prince of <HI>Tartary;</HI> at my Lords left hand was seated the <HI>Beglerbeg,</HI> and next him the captive King of <HI>Or∣mus.</HI> Next to the <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince sat <HI>Threbis-cawn</HI> a disconsolate Prince of <HI>Georgia,</HI> a brave warrior, a constant Christian: opposite to the state Sir <HI>Robert</HI> seated himselfe: and with us were placed the two Princes of <HI>Or∣mus,</HI> and some Sultans. The rest of the great banquetting roome was fild with men of especiall note, Sultans; rich Merchants, and Cooselbashaes: young Ganimeds arrayed in cloth of gold, went up and downe with fla∣gons of pure gold to powre out wine to such as noded for it: upon the car∣pets were spread fine coloured pintado Table cloaths, forty ells long; broad thin pancakes six one upon another served for trenchers, neere which were scattered wodden spoons, whose handles were almost a yard long; the spoone it selfe so thick, so wide, as requir'd a right spatious mouth for entertainment: The feast begins: it was compounded of a hundred sorts of pelo and candid dried meats; as also of Dates, Peares,
<PB N="139" REF="75"/>
and Peaches curiously conserved, such I took best notice of (I meane as pleasd me best) were Iaacks, Myrabolans, Duroyens, Pistachoes, Almonds, Apricocks, Quinces, Cherries, and the rest I leave to the confectioner to inquire after. It seemes we are so infatuated with our banquet and wine, that the Duke is not taken notice of, pray pardon: he is not yet come, that when our bellies are full, our eyes may have the better leisure to surveigh his greatnesse. The feast being ended, the vulgar multitude strove to rend the sky with <HI>Yough Ally-Whoddaw-Bashat, i.e. Ally</HI> and God bee thanked: the Eccho was as a watch-word to the ambitious Duke that hee might en∣ter: his way was made by thirty gallant young gentlemen vested in crim∣son satten; their Tulipants were of silk and silver wreath'd about with cheynes of gold, of Pearle, of Rubies, Turquoises, and Emeralds: all of them were girded with rich swords and imbroydered scabards; they had Hawkes upon their fists, each hood valuing a hundred pound. To these succeeded their Lord, the Arch-Duke of <HI>Sheraz:</HI> his coat was of blew sat∣ten richly imbroydered with silver, upon which he wore a Vest or Roab of great length, so glorious to the eye, so thick powdered with Orientall glittering Gemms, as made the ground of it invisible, the price invalu∣able: his Turbant was of pure fine silke and gold, be studded wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h pearle and Carbuncles; his scabbard was set all over with Rubies, Pearles, and Emralds; his Sandalls resembled the bespangled Firmament. To this Idoll, all the people of his religion sacrifiz'd a hundred Sizaedaes, and Tes∣salems, bowing and knocking their cocks-combs against the ground: Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> also sizaedaed very formally, and in a cup of pure gold drunk his Graces health, and then put it in his pocket; paying him home with this complement; That after so mean a person as himselfe had breath'd in it, it was impiety to offer it him: the Duke accepts it as good coyne, and perceiving our Ambassador very sad, darted him a smile, drunk his Masters health, bad him and his heartily welcome, and so went in againe: our Lord Ambassador also scarce well pleased at the Dukes proud carri∣age, dissembled it; and after reciprocall Sallams or bendings (none but a few Coselbashaws attending him to his horse) departed:</P>
<P>Well may this grand Duke buy his renowne at those high rates, his rents being bruited so great, so wonderfull: hee has (say Merchants) foure hundred thousand Tomans a yeere (a Toman is five marks sterling) but out of this hee payes wages yeerely to fifty thousand horsemen: his plate and jewels is valued at three hundred thousand pounds, some say three Millions, and is pretty well descried by that New-yeeres gift hee sent the King (upon <HI>Meloembeg</HI> the Fiscalls prompting) three yeeres since: <HI>viz:</HI> fifty great flagons of pure gold, seventy two of refined silver: in <HI>Larrees</HI> foure hundred sixty five thousand floryns: the whole, loading three hun∣dred and fifty cozel-bash Camels, a valuable present: and for which the King (as a Symbole of his gratitude) remunerates the Duke with fifty gal∣lant Arabian Coursers, six change of rich garments, a sword, and (of more value than the rest) the assurance of his health and dignity.</P>
<P>This Duke here and in other Seralios (or Harams, as the Persians term them) has above three hundred Concubines; Mawmetry commending it: there is no other way in these Pagan countries to distinguish one mans
<PB N="140" REF="76" MS="y"/>
greatnesse from another, save by exceeding in their females: hee hunts elsewhere, other sports serving as a provocation to base venery: nor do they refraine more manly exercises; chasing the Lion, hunting the Tygre, dislodging the Bore, unkennelling the Iackall, and the like; at which so∣lemne sports he besets whole countries with above twenty thousand men, who serve to rouze all kind of savage game, and when the whole heard are in battelled upon some spacious Mountaine, impales it with a huge Toyle of wyre and cord stak't with wood (six hundred Cammels load) and so either dart them from without the raile, or venture in, and (by drawing a crosse line) single what beast they please to fight with.</P>
<P>Two dayes after the great feast, the Duke with a gallant traine of thirty Sultans and Cooselbashaws came galloping to <HI>Ally-cawn,</HI> (so is the house named we lodged at;) and albeit he endeavoured to assault us with a sudden visit, yet such was the excellent fore-sight and vivacity of our Ambassador, attending all occasions of advantage; that at his alighting, he found a choice shade for his recreation, chambers neatly furnisht, from his Balcony look∣ing into a most fragrant &amp; pleasant garden, where the Paphyan cipresses, &amp; other rare trees in their aparel, repeld the guilded rayes of wanton <HI>Phaeton:</HI> here the facetious Duke incampt and all his company; resolv'd to incoun∣ter the utmost fury of his owne strong wine, and our English chymick wa∣ters: three houres the fight continued hot, charging one another with equall valour; many stout bottles and flagons were emptied and buried, but by strange stratagem revived afresh, thundring so fierce a storme in the Dukes braines, that hee sell back and had undone himselfe, had not my Lord Ambassador by great chance upheld and horst him: the rest percei∣ving their Generall so strangely vanquisht, sound a retreat, and study how to untwist their braines from out that magick labyrinth: Mr. <HI>Stodart</HI> of Caernarvan, a bold Britton, and Mr.<HI>Emery</HI> playd <HI>Bóotes:</HI> Next day the Duke made his excuse, and returnd his thanks in a Present of twelve brave horses, with bridles and saddles suting them; by which it seemes all of them were pleas'd and the Ambassador (who without such an entertain∣ment had never pleas'd them, though infinitly contrary to his temper) was crownd with th' applause of a noble, discreet, liberall, and well fasho∣ned Gentleman. After many other ceremonies of welcome (in which time, piscashes and gifts were not left out) we had leave to set on towards the Court; I call it leave, the Duke was so unwilling to part with us: wee were bravely mounted, furnisht with fresh Cammells and Asinegoes, able to endure the brunt of travell.</P>
<P>Six and twenty dayes wee consumed in <HI>Sheraz,</HI> forced to so long com∣morance by the merry Duke; and on Lady day in Lent, departed thence for <HI>Spahawn</HI> the Persian Metropolis. But I cannot ride farre, till I cele∣brate my <HI>vale-dictum</HI> in this Charistery.</P>

<P>But ere we go further, suffer me to trouble you with such Monarchs as have ruled <HI>Persia,</HI> I will only give you later Kings, such as had their seat royall in <HI>Sheraz,</HI> begunne 700 yeeres ago, and but lately ended: The first, is <HI>Abuzvez Deilamshaw</HI> (injuriously suppos'd a fisherman, from his use of Navigation, as was <HI>Tamberlan</HI> a shepheard from the Tartarrs vagrancy:) this (<HI>Deylamshaw</HI> sirnamed <HI>Boia</HI> (or <HI>Moheia</HI> rather, from fish a calumny) had three sonnes; <HI>Ally, Hushan, Achmet.

Dom.</HI> 940, heg. 320. <HI>Hussan</HI> by death of his elder brother, was Lord of <HI>Parc, Hery, Hierac,</HI> and <HI>Corasan; Acmet</HI> had <HI>Kerman</HI> and <HI>Macron.</HI> To <HI>Hussan</HI> succeeded a stranger <HI>Zedday-Mohee</HI> by name, brought in by <HI>Mustapha</HI> the Ba∣bylonian Calyph; to whom succeeded <HI>Eyna-duddaule</HI> that had no issue. So <HI>Rocnadaul</HI> (<HI>Hussans</HI> sonne) got possession of his fathers seigniories, and dy∣ed <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 980. heg. 360. dividing first his crowne lands amongst his three sonnes; <HI>Sherfa-daule, Shamsdaules,</HI> and <HI>Bahao-daules.</HI> The eldest had <HI>Shyraztan, Larestan</HI> and <HI>Kerman:</HI> the second, <HI>Hierac</HI> and <HI>Diarbec:</HI> the youngest had <HI>Gerioom</HI> and <HI>Taburstan, Sherfadaule</HI> dyed issules <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 990. heg. 370. the second brother inherited; but the envie of traitors gave him small joy, for hee was buried not long after his Coronation; whereby the seigniory came to <HI>Bahao-daules</HI> the youngest sonne of King <HI>Rocknadaule. Bahaodaule</HI> governed twelve yeeres very succesfully, and at's death commanded his eldest son <HI>Sultandaule</HI> to succeed him: this Prince was train'd up in field exercises from his cradle, and by his valour much in∣larged his Empire, yet could not defend himselfe from <HI>Hocem Masharaf∣daule</HI> his restlesse brother, till by agreement the Kingdome was divided: to <HI>Sultandaule, Farsistan,</HI> and <HI>Aywaz:</HI> to <HI>Hocen, Hyerakeyn.</HI> At that time <HI>Gelal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>daul</HI> their brother was invested with the Caliph-ship of <HI>Bagdat Anno Domini</HI> 1021. heg. 401. and <HI>Sultan-daul</HI> at last dyes, and is <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1025. buried in <HI>Shyraz</HI> with great solemnity. <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> his sonne ruled

after him: but perceives the Crowne to totter, yea, to fall off by the un∣naturall practises of <HI>Syarfuddaul</HI> (call'd also <HI>Abul-favar</HI>) his traiterous Uncle; forced thereby to fly to <HI>Gelaladaul</HI> his other Uncle the late made Kaliph, who is glad of this occasion, having long lookt with a squint eye of ambition upon his Nephews Diadem: but dissembing it, with a brave Army he descends from <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and with ease dethrones <HI>Abul-favar,</HI> but mounts himselfe into the throne to <HI>Abdul-cawns</HI> amazement, who to save his life flies into <HI>Arabia:</HI> whiles <HI>Mahomet Gaznehy</HI> from <HI>Hindostant</HI> falls upon <HI>Ayrac</HI> and <HI>Shervan,</HI> but is repeld most shamefully into <HI>Sablestan, Parc</HI> at that instant being miserably trod under-foot by the Turquemen and Deylamans: ere long <HI>Abul-favor</HI> gets so highly into the Calyphs fa∣vour that hee is confirmed in his former title, but in the way death cut off his claime, leaving <HI>Abdul-cawn</HI> the banisht Prince his right, who upon this faire advantage returnes, and is joyfully welcomed: but surfetting of too much joy, hee lived not long after it; for, commending his body to the earth, he gave the royalty to <HI>Aben-melec-Rahim</HI> his sonne, who dyed <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1054. heg. 434. without issue, and in whom (after a race of fif∣teene Kings) took end the <HI>Moheyan</HI> pedegree.</P>
<P>To him succeeded <HI>Abumansor,</HI> who pretended himselfe true sonne of <HI>Gelaladaul</HI> the Caliph: he took to wife <HI>Danta</HI> daughter of <HI>Toshalbeg,</HI> and dyed (after five yeeres greatnesse) in <HI>Kermoen,</HI> and lyes buried at <HI>Hur∣kawn</HI> not farre from <HI>Iasquis:</HI> he had five sonnes by that Lady, <HI>Abumansor∣phulad-sotun, Chozroe-pheruz, Abu-becr, Abuzeddai,</HI> and <HI>Aboally-kay-koz∣rao. Abumansor</HI> inlarged <HI>Shyraz,</HI> and did his best to make it strong and beautifull; but whiles he busied his fancie at home, he looks not abroad, such time his ambitious brother <HI>Cosroe-pheruz</HI> gripes him, and takes unjust possession of his Territories: but revenge pursues him, for being invited to <HI>Bagdat</HI> to see his sick grandsire <HI>Toshalbeg;</HI> for his cruelty to his brother, he is put into a loathsome prison, where famine and stench made an end of him. But this could not terrifie <HI>Abuzedday</HI> the fourth brother from intruding into <HI>Abumansors</HI> right: albeit, his injured brother had escaped and gathered a resolute Army, who so stoutly stood his friends that <HI>Zedday</HI> is slaine and his associates banished. It seemes <HI>Abumansor</HI> was borne to an iron destiny, unable at his second returne, to safegard himselfe from <HI>Fazele</HI> his Liefetenant, that unawares detrudes him into a deadly prison, adorning his rascall browes with his Masters Diadem: <HI>Aboally</HI> will none of that, he takes a happy advantage, and pulls it from <HI>Fazel's</HI> brows and crownes him with one (better becomming Traitors) of flaming iron. <HI>Aboally</HI> after hee had soveraniz'd seven yeeres, is arrested by grim death <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1100. heg. 480. and for want of issue the Scepter falls to <HI>Mahummed Abutalip Togrulbeg,</HI> sonne of <HI>Michael,</HI> sonne of <HI>Salgucius,</HI> sonne of <HI>Didacus,</HI> a Tur∣queman.</P>
<P>In the Salgucian family it continued till <HI>Mahummed Abul-casen</HI> dyed <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1220. heg. 600. without any issue.

<P>Let us now (what pace you please) to <HI>Perse-polis,</HI> not much out of the road: but were it a thousand times further, it merits our paines to view it; being indeed the only bravo Antique-Monument (not in Persia alone) but through all the Orient.</P>
<P>PERSEPOLIS, (first call'd <HI>Elamis</HI> from <HI>Elam</HI> sonne of <HI>Sem</HI> sonne of <HI>Noah</HI>) was built (enlarg'd rather) by <HI>Sosarmus</HI> a Median Dynast, third from <HI>Arbaces</HI> that put a period (by death of <HI>Sardanapalus</HI>) to the Assyrian Monarchy, begun by <HI>Belus</HI> (<HI>Nymrod</HI> and <HI>Iupiter</HI>) and in a glorious successi∣on of one and forty Emperours commanding the world, till <HI>Arbaces</HI> sub∣jected Babylon. By <HI>Cambyses</HI> (sonne to <HI>Cyrus</HI> the magnificent) it was most beautified, and from him to <HI>Darius Codomanus</HI> continued Empresse of <HI>Asia</HI> two hundred &amp; thirty yeares in a line of thirteen Monarchs, till <HI>Alexander</HI> by conquest of all <HI>Asia</HI> made prostrate also this glorious Citie, betrayed by <HI>Teredates,</HI> and demolisht by vehement perswasion of <HI>Thais</HI> an Athenian harlot, who (in revenge of <HI>Xerxe's</HI> expedition into Greece) never gave over exasperating the giddy Macedonian, till shee saw it flaming; an act so unworthy <HI>Alexander</HI> as hee sought to quench it with his teares. A Citie so excellent, that <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> intitle it the richest and most lovely Citie under the Sunne. A high and stately Tower it had, circled with a triple Wall: sixteene cubits high the first, adorn'd with battlements; the second was two and thirty; the third of threescore cubits high, of delicate polisht Marble, entred by many gates of burnisht brasse. To the East rose amiably a hill of foure Akers, in which (in state∣ly Mausoleums) were intombed the Monarchs of the world. Many rare and admirable buildings it had, amongst which, the glorious Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> (mother to that at <HI>Ephesus</HI>) by <HI>Iosephus</HI> report was at that time the most exquisite for Art &amp; material in the world. The stones were of richest Marble and Porphire, the roofe of refined gold. A bayt <HI>Antiochus</HI> the ava∣ritious Atheist long had nibled at, but could not swallow it, as he had done Jerusalems, whence sacrilegiously he ravisht ten tunne of gold. The Pa∣lace royall here, was cut out of the marble rock, above two miles about; the roofe and casements were of Gold, Silver, Amber, &amp; Ivory. The State within, was of gold and orientall glittering gems, in one roome an artifi∣ciall Vine (presented by <HI>Pythius</HI>) the stalk pure gold, the clusters of pearls and carbuncles; his bolster was valued at five thousand Talents of gold, his footstoole worth three thousand; such, as (after the unruly Greeks had pillag'd three dayes) gave the Macedonian Victor for his part, 120000 Talents, or 72 millions of crownes, a masse of gold: yet very possible, if it be true old Histories report (<HI>Herodotus</HI> is one) how that at that time, the Monarchs of Persia (besides the Tribute of other Kingdomes) had yeerely
<PB N="144" REF="78"/>
out of Indya three hundred and threescore Talents of gold. Easily then might the Greek load away (as story sayes) three thousand Mules, with two and thirty millions and 750000 pounds in coyne, though in that ado∣lescency of the world, one would wonder so much treasure was found. But we may beleeve it, since sacred writ tells us that in <HI>Solomons</HI> reigne, in Jerusalem gold and silver was as common as stones. Also <HI>Xenophon,</HI> that when <HI>Cyrus</HI> descended into Asia the lesse, hee brought back no lesse than 125 millions of pounds. But why stand we gaping at these prodigious sums. <HI>Pauper enim non est, cui rerum suppetit usus.</HI> These sparkling Diamonds, what are they but Mammons eyes; this Chaos of gold, but refined clay. What Magick then to make Idolaters. For my part (by Gods help) I in∣tend rather to admire the Anatomy of this glorious ruine, which <HI>Don Garzia de Silva Figuroa</HI> (Ambassador <HI>Anno</HI> 1619 to <HI>Abbas</HI> from <HI>Philip</HI> the third) calls it the only Monument of the world, without Imposture; yea farre exceeding (sayes he) all other miracles in the world, wee can either heare or see at this day. Miserable in my poore description.</P>
<P>The ribs or ruines of <HI>Persepolis</HI> are at this day call'd <HI>Chil-Manor</HI> or <HI>Che∣hel-Manor</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> forty Towers) in the idiom of Persia: and might more properly have said <HI>Hashtot-Manor,</HI> or eighty Towers, for so many are easily told two yards out of the ground; and if from so many pillars as are perfect and lofty, then may they say <HI>Nouzda-Manor</HI> or nineteene Towers, at this day no more standing, one excepted at the East below, above a bow shot thence. The whole Basis is cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by incredible toyle, out of the solid marble rock, twice the compasse of <HI>Wyndsor</HI> Castle, ascended by fourescore and fifteene easie staires, dissected from the durable black Marble, so broad that a dozen horse may goe abreast: the perpendicular is two and twenty Geometric feet, and where the staires are not, the rock is precipitious. Neere the highest step, is the entrance into the Palace; the breadth is visi∣ble, in despight of flame and weather: on one side the gate stands a monstrous great Elephant, on the other a Rhinoceros; the distance is about twenty foot, the portraicts are out of the shining Marble, ten yards high either of them, fixt and perpetuall: a few paces thence, are of like work, bulk and matter two gallant Towers, and (to finish the Porters Lodge) neere them is an other ruine, a Pegasus an invention of the Sculptor to il∣lustrate his Art: and being past this portall, the Apollo opens, a faire even ground, deplorable in many ruines, a hundred white Marble pillars, whole and broken dignifying this once most excellent structure. Upon many of these white Marble pillars the Storks have builded them their nests, where the rage of winde and weather is more offensive to them than any dread they have of the people who inhabit neere them: in all unseasonable stormy or cold weather they forsake the Region and fly where the Sunne can comfort them: the Persians have many superstitious stories concern∣ing 'em, and suppose them (as else-where I have noted) the Emblems of piety and gratitude. The Pillars which are at this day standing, (but seeme to groane under the tyrannie of Time) are twixt fifteene &amp; twenty cubits high, &amp; rise beautifully in forty squares or concave parallels; every square has three full inches; whereby the circuit may be gathered: most excel∣lent is the matter, most elegant the work, and no lesse commendable, the
<PB N="145" REF="78"/>
order and shape how they are placed: in posture, in shew, to this day ad∣mirable; but when they stood in lustre and perfection, were else-where scarce imitable. From the ordinary standing, we easily enjoyed a most de∣lightfull prospect: but in the summity or advantage a brave Horizon of thirty miles unlimitted Plains every way gave it selfe to this Emperial Pal∣lace, as seeming to submit it selfe in a happy lowlinesse.</P>

<P>In part of this great roome (not farre from the portall) in a mirrour of polisht marble, wee noted above a dozen lynes of strange characters, very
<PB N="146" REF="79"/>
faire and apparent to the eye, but so mysticall, so odly framed, as no Hie∣rogliphick, no other deep conceit can be more difficultly fancied, more ad∣verse to the intellect. These consisting of Figures, obelisk, triangular, and pyramidall, yet in such Simmetry and order as cannot well be called barba∣rous. Some resemblance, I thought some words had of the Antick Greek, shadowing out <HI>Ahashuerus Theos.</HI> And though it have small concordance with the Hebrew, Greek, or Latine letter, yet questionlesse to the In∣venter it was well knowne; and peradventure may conceale some excel∣lent matter, though to this day wrapt up in the dim leafes of envious ob∣scuritie.</P>
<P>Adjoyning this, is another square roome, from angle to angle ninety paces, in circuit three hundred and threescore paces: beautified with eight dores, foure of them are six paces broad; the other foure, three a peece: all eight severally composd of seven great polisht Marbles fixt one upon another; each of those stones are foure yards logn, five quarters high, most excellently ingraven with Images of Lyons, Gryffins, Tigres, and Bulls: and in other places (for the wals are durable) Battailes, Heca∣tombs, Triumphs, Olympick games, and the like, in very rare Sculpture and proportion. Above each doore is ingraven the Idea of a Majestique Monarch; his roabe is long, a <HI>Tiara</HI> or <HI>Mithra</HI> on his head, his hayre very long and curled; in one hand he holds a Globe, in the other his Scepter, a garbe and session never used by Persian Princes. The silly inhabitants (who made no accompt of it till of late) name him, <HI>Iamshet,</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sampson,</HI> and <HI>Salomon,</HI> a wonder they leave out <HI>Rustan</HI> their <HI>Hercules,</HI> and as easie for invention. A third chamber conjoynes the last we spoke of, this (if they lie not that told us so) was a Gynecie or Nursery; it has foure un∣equall angles, two sides are sixtie; the other two, seventy of my largest paces. From that we issued into a fourth roome, two sides are twenty, the other two, thirty paces. The walls are very eminent in this chamber, of black shining Marble, in many places so bright and jetty, as we could easily view our reflex, no steel mirror comparing with it. In most parts the walls are cut into Gygantive Images, illustrated with Gold, to this day permanent. Somewhat further, over heaps of stones of valewable portraictures, we mount towards the most lofty part of this Pallace, where we saw the resemblances of a devout King, adoring his three Dietyes, the Sunne, the Fire, a Serpent, all which are cut upon the perpendicu∣lar Mountaine. The other side of this high hill is a precipice, downe which is no descending. But whether this Fabrick was <HI>Ionick, Dorick,</HI> or <HI>Corinthiack,</HI> in the perfection, I cannot determine, the ruines forbid a positive judgement. But such at this day it is, that a ready Lymmer in three moneths space can hardly (to do it well) depict out all her excellencies. Pitty it is, it is not done, the barbarous people every day defacing it and cleaving it asunder for grave-stones and benches to sit upon. Five miles West from <HI>Chehel-manor</HI> is also a gallant Monument, a Giant cut into a monstruous proportion, whom the illiterate Persians say was <HI>Rustan,</HI> and from him cald <HI>Nocta-Rustan.</HI> I rather judge it the Image of great <HI>Alex∣ander,</HI> who had a desire, that after ages might think him more than a man, and his men more than Monsters, as appeared in his conceit to make
<PB N="147" REF="79" MS="y"/>
many Armors, bigg enough for three men, and scatter them in <HI>India</HI> that the people might not dare to rebell, lest those Poliphems came to lash them.</P>
<P>Neere <HI>Chilmanor</HI> is <HI>Mardash</HI> (corruptly by the Spaniard cald <HI>Margate∣an</HI>) a Towne of two hundred houses, the people so superstitious that such houses as we came in they perfumd and ayr'd (some were happily fired) for that we were not Mussulmen. From this place to <HI>Sheraz</HI> are ten far∣sangs; interposd by some craggy hills and a pleasant river (<HI>Rhogomana</HI> of old) over which is a bridge, the best till then we saw in <HI>Persia.</HI> This river is by <HI>Quintus Curtius lib.</HI> 5. and <HI>Strabo lib.</HI> 15. named <HI>Araxis</HI> (<HI>Cho-Araxes</HI> is a fitter name) streaming (sayes he) twentie furlongs from <HI>Persepolis.</HI> Another of that name, so often mentioned by <HI>Ptol. Mela, Plutarch,</HI> and <HI>Lucan,</HI> is in <HI>Armenia,</HI> and indeed divides it from <HI>Medya,</HI> at this day cald <HI>Arash</HI>) and very famous.</P>
<P>After two dayes stay in view of old <HI>Persepolis,</HI> the eight and twentieth day we took horse, and that night rid foure and twentie miles to a Town cald <HI>Moy own;</HI> in midway twixt which two Townes, we noted a high im∣pregnable mount, at whose top, stood desperately a Castle so fortified by Nature and industrie, as may be thought impregnable. A late rebel∣lious Sultan (weary of slavery) man'd it against his Prince victorious <HI>Ab∣bas,</HI> who (to terrifie others by his example) came in person to chastise him. But such was the precipitious height where the Castle stood, and the narrow entrance so bravely defended, that in six moneths siege hee could see no signe of victory. Loth he is to leave it so, and what strata∣gem to take, cannot imagin. A great reward he promises to any would ef∣fect it. Valour is invalidable. Art Magique perpetrates it. An old wi∣zard covetous of so much money promises the Divells best, and according∣ly, by his infernall spells so possest with threats and phantasmaes the wretched Sultan, that upon the witches assurance of pardon he descends, the block rewards him. But <HI>Abbas</HI> acknowledges the Inchanter had me∣rited his price and grudgingly gave it him. The foolish man so doates upon his gold, that he sees not danger. The King repents the losse of it, and knowes no way to recover it but by sending him to Satan without his head, the reason of his Justice was for his Sorcery. A quality at other times he commended deeply, but now abhorred it: a pretty pollicy. To re∣turne.</P>
<P><HI>Moyown,</HI> is delightfully seated; enricht with sweet water, excel∣lent Wine, much wood, and Natures Carpets. It properly belongs to the highly reverenced Prophet <HI>Izmael,</HI> whose tombe <HI>Emoom-Izmael</HI> is here seen, by liberality of many Kings, and great men not a little honoured: to∣wards its maintenance (and the Priests) the Towne gives yearly twelve thousand mawnd-shaw of Rice, and foure thousand of Barley. Next night we lodgd (slept I cannot say) in <HI>O-jone,</HI> a village of thirty Families, all of them Prophets or Prophets children. We ever found least profit, where Prophets dwelt, no wine nor grapes allowd to grow amongst them; not that wine is bad, but out of a Tradition they have, that it is the blood of those Gyants that warr'd against the Gods. Next day we rode over most craggy, steep, and terrible high hills, and at night made <HI>Tartang</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="80"/>
our <HI>Manzeil;</HI> a small Towne, only famous in a high Sepulcher, clothd with violet coloured velvet, under which is buried a great Uncle of the Kings. Next night to <HI>Assepose,</HI> notable only in an old mud Castle, sometimes a garrison; in and about which, are fourty thousand Georgians and Sarcasshes, by profession Christians; by quality, Captives; a people much honouring Saint <HI>George</HI> the Cappadocian Bishop their converter. They differ from Mahomitans (not in habit, but) in their gray eyes and long white hayre (<HI>Albani ab albo crine</HI>) after the mode of Antick Gallants, recorded by <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Lucian,</HI> tissued with fillets of gold or sil∣ver. If any of these turne Mahomitan, they are preferd beyond vulgar mer∣rit. Poore soules, hearing that we were Christians, they flockt about us, yea wept to see us. Not much distant hence, is <HI>Thymar,</HI> memorable if <HI>Byzar</HI> erre not, in a brave and Antient Monument, by some Hebrew characters supposd the buryall place of <HI>Bathsheba,</HI> Mother of King <HI>Salomon:</HI> tis cald <HI>Musqued-Zulzimen,</HI> i.e. <HI>Solomons</HI> Chappell; a place if truly so, worthy the seeing. Next night we lay in <HI>Whoomgesh,</HI> next in <HI>Cuzcuzat,</HI> next day to <HI>Bazeba-chow,</HI> and next to <HI>Degardow,</HI> eight leagues from which place, (and neerer <HI>Tezdycaus</HI>) we rode over a steepe Mountaine of black shining Marble, (and where are Quarries of Serpentine and Porphyre, if the earth were lookt into) the descent was so percipicious, that but by ragged steps and those not a little dangerous, was no riding downe: howbeit downe we got, and that night rode to <HI>Gumbazellello</HI> (famous in a <HI>Carvans-raw</HI> and the best wheat bread in <HI>Persia;</HI>) next night to <HI>Yezdecawz</HI> a Towne built in the bottome of a valley, sunck downe in mid a great plaine, whereby it is scarce to be found, did not a Castle point it out, raisd by <HI>Yezdgyrd</HI> a Persian King above the Towne, and where is a very stately <HI>Carravans-raw,</HI> the best from thence to <HI>Bander</HI> on the Gulph of <HI>Persia.</HI> Next day (through <HI>De-Moxalbeg</HI>) we got to <HI>Amno-baut</HI> (by some cald <HI>Boyall</HI>) a village of thirty families, all of them a postat Georgians, inclosd, to exclude their shame, by a high, strong, round wall raisd with battlements, resembling a Castle; commanded by <HI>Daut</HI> (or <HI>David</HI>) <HI>Chawn</HI> (brother to the Duke of <HI>Sheraz</HI>) an Apostate, for which he was made an Eparch, and honourd with three silly temporary Tittles, bought with losse of an eternall Crowne of hap∣pinesse: he has here a pretty <HI>Carvan-sraw</HI> and Summer houses for his owne delight, wherein are five neat roomes curiously painted in Imagery and imbost with gold; his Gardens are also sweet and prettily contrivd into grotts, mazes, vollieres, and the like, equall to that of <HI>Aladeul'</HI> at <HI>Ca∣ramit</HI> for his Assassinates; but nasty and deformed if compard with Para∣dize: from <HI>Amno-baut</HI> we rode next day to <HI>Commeshaw,</HI> a Towne boasting in a thousand houses and much Antiquitie. It may be either that same Towne which <HI>Pliny</HI> cald <HI>Parodana,</HI> or that <HI>Ore-batys</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy:</HI> Sir <HI>Ro∣bert Sherley</HI> was once her Governour, under that wicked parricide <HI>Con∣standel chawn;</HI> but it seems they bore small love to either of their memo∣ries, neither vouchsafing to bid us welcome (as most Townes did we hitherto past through, although I have omitted to speak their ceremo∣nies) nor a lodging, a base respect to so noble a passenger. At this place <HI>Persia</HI> is limited, and where <HI>Ayrac</HI> (or <HI>Parthya</HI>) takes her beginning: <HI>Chi∣raef, Gardon-achow, Nowbengan, Kazeron, Pherushabad, Estacher, Nabandi∣oem,</HI>

are reckned Townes in <HI>Farsistan,</HI> I have but named them. But that you may the better go along with us; and especially in that the latest Maps of <HI>Persia</HI> are so erronious, both in rivers, the scituation of places, and their true names (for to say truly, none of them have five right names;) I have therefore inserted this of the Persian Empyre; in which, neither the po∣sition of Places are false, nor names of Townes fictitious or borrowed:</P>

<P>Next day we got to <HI>Moyeor;</HI> agrandiz'd by a thousand families; but none of their houses compare with their dove-houses for neat and curious out∣sides: they have some excuse for it; some of them are descended (not
<PB N="150" REF="81" MS="y"/>
from <HI>Columba Noae</HI> but) from those holy Pigeons, who fed at <HI>Mahomets</HI> eare and advanced his reputation not a little, perswading the simple peo∣ple they brought him newes from some (bad) Angels, concerning their happinesse. Next night we were usherd to <HI>Spawhawnet</HI> by a servant of <HI>Me∣loyembegs</HI> the Kings Fiscall who intreated the Ambassadors to repose a day or two there, till <HI>Spahawn</HI> had fitted it selfe for a solemne intertainment: where whiles we repose we may remember, that most of those <HI>Manzeils</HI> we have past from <HI>Chehelmanor</HI> to his place, are twixt twenty and thirtie miles asunder. The whole distance is somewhat above two hundred miles, as I computed them.</P>
<P>The tenth of Aprill wee set out from <HI>Spahawnet</HI> a village six miles South from <HI>Spahawn:</HI> when we had gone a farsang (three miles,) we were stayed by the way to taste a banquet in a spacious garden of the Kings, whither the English Agent and such other Christian Merchants as were in <HI>Spahawn</HI> came out to attend our Lord Ambassador: a mile neerer the Citie, the Visier, the Sultan of <HI>Spahawn, Meloyembeg</HI> and <HI>Hodge-nazar</HI> the Armenian Prince with foure thousand horse and innumerable foot, came to bid us a happy entrance: the fields two miles from the towne were re∣plenisht with vulgar men, women and childen; the <HI>Bannyans</HI> like caterpil∣lers swarmd about us; all together, in a volley of thundering acclamations cried out <HI>Hoshomody, Suffowardy,</HI> the better sort <HI>Hoshgaldom</HI> i.e. welcome, heartily welcome: forty kettle Drums, Fifes, Tabrets Tymbrels, dancing wenches, Hocus Pocusses, and other Anticks past my numbring inobled the ceremony: the bridge was full of women on both sides, many of them in faire deportment unmasqued their faces. The first place we alighted at was the <HI>Conna-potshaugh,</HI> the Kings Pallace, placed at the West side of the Medan or great Market: there the Noble men kneeled downe, and <HI>tessalemd,</HI> three times kissing the Kings threshold, and as many times knock∣ing their heads against the ground in an awfull obeysance: Sir <HI>Robert Sher∣ley</HI> sizedaed also and contented them; a Coselbash ended the ceremo∣ny in a panegyrick to this purpose: That the Fame and excellency of <HI>Shaw-Abbas</HI> was so great as had attracted a great Prince and other Gentlemen from the extreamest Angle of the world, to see whether fame had been partiall in his magnificence: no wonder, since his radiant beames spread themselves over all the Universe: that done, some bottles of good Wine were lavisht out, after which with a continued clamour of the Plebeyans, we were conducted to a brave house of the Kings, at the South-East end of the City, through which, a deep broad water had its course into the <HI>Sindery.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth day after our being in <HI>Spahawn,</HI> the English Agent banquet∣ed our Lord Ambassador, and shewed us a rich and hearty welcome: to agrandize it, at night a Tanck of water was beset with lighted Tapers, ar∣tificially uniting the two contrary Elements; squibs also and other fire∣works, that made all the City gaze and gape with wonder. Next day <HI>Hodge∣nazar</HI> was visited at his house in <HI>Ielphea;</HI> a Christian he professes himselfe, but (I must be bold to tell him) his house is furnisht with such beastly pi∣ctures, as no way relish of honest or Christian invention: amongst our other
<PB N="151" REF="81"/>
cates, we had a rosted pig, a meat to Jew and Persian infinitely offen∣sive: the Wine flagons and Bowles here, were of purest gold. I desire to speak a little of these Armenians, that the rest of our Travailes may be woven with more ease and fewer mixtures.</P>
<P>These Armenians are cald also <HI>Ielphelyns</HI> from the City they dwell in here, nam'd from their Metropole neere <HI>Ararat.</HI> In habit they differ not from the Persians, but live in equall freedome: they professe Christ, and account Saint <HI>George</HI> their Patron, from whom some think <HI>Georgia</HI> takes name, and not from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Husbandmen; they and the Georgians are habited alike: this is their greatest difference, that the Georgians excell in warre, the Armenians in merchandize: this Image may well represent them both.</P>

It is divided into <HI>major &amp; minor:</HI> the greater is confind by <HI>Tartary</HI> to the North, by <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Assyria</HI> to the South: the West and East with the <HI>Euxin</HI> and <HI>Caspian</HI> seas: It includes <HI>Colchis, Albania, Georgia, Iberia, &amp;c.</HI> obscured in other barbarous names, as <HI>Zuria, Goweria, Mengrellia, Turq'mania, Cara-culia. Gurgee, Haloen,</HI> and <HI>Sarlochya</HI> (from <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI>) and to which place, the ten Tribes were brought by <HI>Salma∣nasser</HI> the <HI>Assyrian.</HI></P>
<P>They have two Patriarchs or Protomists; one at <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> the other at <HI>Syna</HI> in <HI>Arabia;</HI> sometimes they reside at <HI>Sis</HI> neer <HI>Tharsus</HI> or at <HI>Ecmea∣zin</HI> neer <HI>Rhivan,</HI> or <HI>Ervan</HI> in <HI>Shervan. Antioch</HI> their old Sea they dare not chalenge. They have the three first generall Councells in great honour, study the Latin tongue, (rare in <HI>Asia</HI>); they have twelve titular Bishops, three hundred some say; poore, but no way despicable. They have the old and new Testaments in their mother tongue; the Letany also, part of which, is every Lords day read and expounded in the Churches: they ad∣minister the Lords Supper in both kinds, Bread and Wine; and deny a reall presence; they allow but our two Sacraments: Baptisme they celebrate after the Eutichyan sort, as <HI>Iacobus</HI> (father of the <HI>Iacobites</HI>) and <HI>Iohannes Philipponus Anno Dom.</HI> 550 mis-taught them: the proselit gentiles or Mo∣humedans in the fore-head with a burning crosse, others they baptise with two fingers, and signe the Infant with the crosse, as glorying in that hyerogliphick the Jews and Mussulmen esteeme so ignominiously of: are also great lovers of Tradition: they pray not for the dead, imagining that till the generall day of doom they are without joy or torture. Five Sabbaths in every yeare they abstaine from flesh, fish, cheese, and butter; in memory of those five Ages, wherein their barbarous forefathers used to immolate their children unto the old red Dragon: all wednesdayes and fridayes also in the yeare except from Easter to Ascention they fast pre∣cisely: and no other Christians are such strict Lent-observers: for they re∣frayne their wives that time; and from flesh, fish, milk, egges, butter; those forty dayes feeding only upon oyle, bread, honey, water, dates, cowcumbers, melons, herbs, and the like. At other times they eat hogs flesh. Before the three great Festivalls, they fast twelve dayes: they mar∣ry betimes at nine or twelve yeers: the Layety are permitted to wed twice the Ecclesiastiques but once: trigamy to all is hatefull. The Presbitry are much honoured. Images in their Churches they detest, but at home have pictures of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Priapus.</HI> The crosse they regard, but worship not, beleeve not purgatory▪ their Temples are but meanely beautifull. Obedience and respect to the better and elder sort is much practisd. They punish theft and adultery severely. In some things they are but refind Ido∣laters: as in some burialls, they lead about the Church an unspotted Lambe with much solemnity; they then sacrifice, divide and give each there a bitt to eat; as a Simbol, or superstitious bond, obliging one another in love and charity: to mee it seems they derive this custome from that of the Hebrews, who used to divide a calfe, as <HI>Moses</HI> records in 15. <HI>Gen.</HI> 9. and as <HI>Ieremie</HI> notes in the 34 <HI>Ch.</HI> 18.19. verses. On good Friday they represent the passion and buriall of our Saviour: during which, they weep and ingeminate their ejaculations. On Easter they intimate the resurre∣ction
<PB N="153" REF="82"/>
by a representative body, using all that morning the old salute of joy; He is risen indeed: an Angelicall note they call it. That day they celebrate with great Feasts, the Mahomitans nor Iews not daring to min∣gle among them; The King allowes them that priviledge. They fast upon the Nativity of our Saviour. The Iesuits labour to knit them into <HI>Rome;</HI> but in vaine: they stand much upon their Antiquity, and name two hun∣dred grave and learned Bishops since their conversion, many of which were noble Martyrs or witnesses: the report of an envious <HI>Doeg</HI> that they had submitted to <HI>Rome,</HI> agnising the Pope their head, made <HI>Abbas</HI> storme and not to be pacified, till a thousand of them were made headlesse: up∣on which the rest implore help and revenge from the Turk, raising a bloody scean of ensuing Troubles. Some say that <HI>Lodovic Grangier</HI> a Ie∣suite lately crost the black sea into <HI>Mengrellia,</HI> where <HI>Threbis-chawn</HI> en∣treated him gently and by his charity they are much purged from super∣stition: which if so, I wonder that his name is of no more fame amongst them.</P>

three hundred yeere ago it was called <HI>Dura;</HI> but whether in that <HI>Dura</HI> the haughty Assyrian erected his golden Colosse, I finde it not. <HI>Hecatom∣pylos</HI> is the next name it had; recorded by <HI>Apollodorus, Polibius, Ptolomy,</HI> and <HI>Pliny, lib.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 8. so denominated from her hundred gates; whereby we may imagine her in those dayes great and stately; and though in <HI>Alexan∣ders</HI> conquest <HI>Curtius</HI> name her not, it seemes she then varied into that Greekish nomenclation: and of this name we have a story, that <HI>Demetrius Nycanor</HI> (<HI>Sotors</HI> sonne) thirsting after <HI>Syria</HI> and Jerusalem, was (upon his trecherous killing <HI>Antiochus, Alexanders</HI> sonne, to make the conquest easier) affronted by <HI>Tryphon</HI> Lieftenant of <HI>Syria,</HI> and forced to flie to <HI>Ar∣baces</HI> the Persian King for succour, who being acquainted with his unna∣turall ambition, not only denied him the law of hospitality, but sent him prisoner to <HI>Hecatompylon,</HI> where he was fettered; till upon submission and promise of more obedience hee was releast, and by <HI>Arbaces</HI> reseated in his owne Dominions.</P>

From whence the name <HI>Spawhawn</HI> derives it selfe, is not knowne unto the Natives (I askt it them) how then shall wee get intelligence? tis a thing for certainty impossible, yet will I venture a conjecture that it is either that old Town <HI>Spada,</HI> where Eunuches were first gelded, or from a compound of <HI>Aspa</HI> (a horse) and <HI>Chawna</HI> (a house, or stable, or the like) <HI>Spawhawn per Aphe∣resin &amp; Syncopen</HI> euphonically contracted; the rather conjectured, in that the Hypodrome (the body of the great <HI>Mydan</HI>) was an old famous place, for view of horses: if that content not. I must ingeniously confesse, I think this City was never named <HI>Hecatompylon:</HI> such a one I know there was famoused in many Authors: but by observing the position 37 degrees 50 minutes in <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> I take <HI>Coom</HI> or <HI>Cazbyn</HI> to bee the relict of it: the rather, in that <HI>Ptolomy, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> in their Geography, place <HI>Aspa</HI> in <HI>Parthia,</HI> in 36 deg.; a name from whence <HI>Aspahawn</HI> may credibly have been deduced: besides, the lat. is more agreeable: or peradventure from <HI>Aspadana</HI> which they place in 33 deg. <HI>Spawhawns</HI> latitude.</P>

<P>Speak we now of the magnificence: wee have told you how the story of <HI>ben-Abivakez</HI> a thousand yeeres ago, cals her a great City, but gives us no better description, <HI>Ben-Ionas</HI> (who sayes he saw it foure hundred seventy six yeeres ago) affoords her twelve miles compasse, rich, and populous. <HI>Man∣devel, A.D.</HI> 1300 (which is above 300 yeeres since) saies that in his time she was a noble City. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1474, <HI>Ioseph Barbarus</HI> was here (<HI>Vsan Cassan</HI> reign∣ing) and hee describes <HI>Spahawn</HI> to bee a great and famous City, peopled with 1500000 soules, the Towne and Suburbs ten miles in compasse. <HI>Rab∣bi Benjamin</HI> and <HI>Contarenus</HI> the Venetian Ambass. 80 yeere ago, relate that then shee had 20 Italian miles in circuit, and <HI>Lemius</HI> the Portuguise sent by <HI>Albuquerq</HI> to <HI>Sha-Ismael, An. Dom.</HI> 1513. reports her glorious.</P>
<P>I shall now more largely, and truly acquaint you with her present stan∣ding. <HI>Spawhawn,</HI> Metropolis of the Persian Monarchy, is seated in the Parthian Territory now cal'd <HI>Ayrack,</HI> &amp; as Umbelic to that spacious bodie at this day awed by the Persian Scepter: from the Persian gulph removed a hundred seventie nine farsangs, (of English miles five hundred thirtie seven,) from the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea a hundred and twenty farsangs (three hundred and sixty miles;) from <HI>Shyraz</HI> two hundred twenty two miles, from <HI>Babylon</HI> foure hundred and fifty, from <HI>Candahor</HI> eight hundred and seventie, from <HI>Cazbyn</HI> 270. In compasse at this day nine English miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circuit.</NOTE> including seventy thousand houses, and of soules above two hundred thousand, com∣pos'd (besides Natives) of English, Duch, Portuguiz', Pole, Muscovit, In∣dian, Arabian, Armenian, Georgian, Turk, Jew, and others, drawne thi∣ther by the magnetick power of gaine and novelty: many things here are memorable; which for order sake I will present you thus divided. The Mydan, Mosques, Hummums, Gates, Pallaces, Gardens, Monuments, and <HI>Ielphey</HI> the City adjoyning.</P>
<P>Let me lead you into the Mydan, into the which ere I can bring you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">River.</NOTE> we passe over a well-built Bridge of stone, supported by five and thirty pillars, through which the Syndery (or Zindaren) from the Acrocerau∣nian Mountaines streames gently; spreading in rainie seasons here welnigh so broad as the Thames at <HI>London,</HI> but nothing so navigable; in Summer

her Channells being discovered. The Mydan or great Market, is without doubt the most spacious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mydan.</NOTE> pleasant, and Aromatick Market in the Vni∣verse; a thousand paces from North to South, the other way above two hundred, resembling our Exchange, or the place Royall in <HI>Paris,</HI> but six times larger: the building is of Brick, well made, and in delightfull man∣ner fabricated; the whole Mydan joyntly continued: the inside is full of shops, each shop full of ware, archt above (and in a Cupolo) atop tarras∣wise framed, and with plaister (like that of <HI>Paris</HI>) cemented. This My∣dan being the noblest part, is so placed in the heart of this triumphant City. The Kings Pallace (or Chonna-Potshaugh) conjoynes the West side of the Mydan, possessing a large quantity backwards, but juts not to the street further than the other buildings, nor to the street side gives any magnifick front or state, her best bravery being in the trimme, pargetted and pain∣ted with blew and gold, in mosaick or antick sort, interlac't with posies of Arabick, either savoring of ostentation (they deifie their Kings) or for instruction from the Alcoran; within, the roomes are archt, enlighten'd by curious trellizes, the roofe imbost above with red, white, blew, and gold, the sides with sports and painted Images; the ground spread with rich and curious carpets of silke and gold, without other furniture. Tar∣rassed above, garnisht with a Pharoe over-topping many Mosques, and ex∣cellent for view and breathing. The wildernesse behinde, is fild with ayery Citizens, priviledg'd from hurt or affrights, and for which they returne their thankfull notes in a more swift melodious consort, than if they were in the exactest vollyere in the Vniverse.</P>
<P>The North Ile in the Medan, shews eight or nine spacious archt rooms, hung with Lamps and latten Candlesticks, which being lighted, gives a curious splendor. Thither the Potshaw and others go to see pastimes of tumbling, dancing girls, and painted Catamites, that damned sinne being tolerated by the Alcoran. The furthest end North is appropriate for Mynts; the first day silver, gold the second, next day brasse. Not farre thence are victualling shops, wherein, to feed the helpfull belly, after the busie eye and painfull feet are satiated.</P>
<P>Afore the Kings doore, and within the Hippodrome, lye unmounted one and thirty Demicannons of brasse, and twelve iron Culverins, brought hither (by some late over-throw they gave the Portugall or Turk) from <HI>Ormus</HI> or <HI>Babylon.</HI> Opposite to this Pallace is a faire Mosque, but that at the South end (of all others) most excellent; the outside stone, not form'd to the Crosse (the hyerogliphic of our salvation) as ours bee; but round, either from the Talmud, figuring out Aeternity, or from the Alcaba in <HI>Mecca,</HI> the shape whereof was reveal'd to <HI>Abraham</HI> from heaven, pat∣tern'd from that, <HI>Adam</HI> (sayes their Alcoran) reard in Paradise: within 'tis distinguisht into Iles, the wals lined 15 geometrick foot high from the sole with white well polisht Marble; without pews or seats: in center is a state∣ly Tanck; and at the portall another, octanguler, fild with cristall streams which is first forced to glide round the inside the Medan through a stone channell six foot deep, and six in bredth, which after a pleasant drilling murmur, flowes into this Tanck (or watery Magazeen) whence it is suckt out by subterranean passages into many private houses and gardens.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hummums.</NOTE>The Hummums or Sudatories in this Citie are many and very beauti∣full; quadrated some, but most be globous.

The last, a <HI>Seralio,</HI> fa∣mous for pretious treasure and as valuable beauties, of which (being dan∣gerous to inquire or view) wee will speake in silence; the Castle is very large, well wall'd and deeply moated: arm'd with some brazen peeces, but better defended by a troop of leane fac't, beardlesse, memberlesse Eunuchs, who like so many angry Sagittaries guard their Ladies. The bat∣tlements are pleasant to looke on, but no doubt the Horyzontall plaine which is easily discovered from thirty rising Turrets there, yeelds most pleasure.</P>

call it Paradize: all whose excellencies we will joyne in one at the South-West end of <HI>Spawhawn, Nazer-jareeb</HI> by name, a garden famoused deser∣vedly over all this Monarchy.</P>
<P>If you go from the Medan, you passe by <HI>Cherbaugh,</HI> through an even delicate street two miles long at the least, most part of the way wall'd on both sides, bestrew'd with Moholls or Summer houses, but more remark∣able in that abundance of greene, broad, spreading, Chenore trees, yeel∣ding shade, and incomparable order and beauty; the garden (or rather fruit Forrest) of <HI>Nazerjareeb</HI> is circled with a stately wall about three miles in compasse, entred by three gates strong and elegantly shaped. From North to South it gave mee a thausand paces, from East to West seven hundred, from one end to the other easily discovered, by reason a faire open Ally (like that in <HI>Fountain b'leau</HI>) runs along in parellell, distinguisht into nine Ascents, each surmounting other a large foot, each distance smooth and even. In center, is a spatious Tanck, made into twelve equal sides, each side or square is five foot, fild, and round set with pipes of lead which (after the Italick sort) spouts out the liquid element in variety of conceits and postures; that sort of pastime continuing thence to the North gate, where is rais'd a pile of pleasure, antickly garnisht without; within, divided into foure or six chambers; the lower, is set out with Tancks of rich white Marble, and fumes out a coole breese, by quaffing up so much chrystaline water as makes it bubble thither by a constreyned mo∣tion, cut by incredible toyle thorow the Coronian Mountaine.</P>
<P>The higher roomes are garnisht with variety of landskips, and repre∣sents their way of sporting, hawking, fishing, riding, shooting, wrastling, courting, and other fancies; the roofe or seeling is inricht with beaten gold, imbost with azure. But, what seemd to mee most excellent, was the view we enjoyed from her Tarrasses, which affoorded us a dainty pro∣spect of most part of the City; which, (save at <HI>Rustans</HI> Tombe, upon a hill two miles thence) elsewhere cannot be obteyned. This garden is replenisht with trees of all sorts; for medicine, for shade, for fruit: all so greene, so sweet, so pleasant, as may well be term'd a <HI>compendium</HI> of sense-ravishing delights, or King <HI>Abbas</HI> his Paradise.</P>

distant, nothing memorable, save an old Castle in the way, which, by <HI>Cyn∣thia's</HI> palenesse, we could hardly discover. From <HI>Bawt</HI> wee got by break of day to <HI>Obigarmy,</HI> both of them houses of the Kings, who has at every twelve miles end a severall Lodge betwixt <HI>Spawhawn</HI> and the Caspian Sea like these, and wherein our Ambassadour had the honour to repose. And now we are past the danger; let me tell it you. Most part of the last night wee crost a miserable inhospitable sandie Desart, ten long miles broad, in length a hundred: where we beheld mountaines of loose sand, accumula∣ted by the winds fury in such heaps as upon any great wind the tract is lost, and passengers (too oft) involv'd and stifled by that impetuous mercilesse Tyrant, yea Camels, Horses, Mules, or other beasts, though strong, swift and steady, perish without mercy: Albeit the King (to do as much as may be for prevention) has rais'd at every 3 miles end a Castle, but by the un∣stable foundation, is in March &amp; September in despight of their best props yeerely peece-meale torne asunder, without any remaines of their late standing. This our last nights travell was thirty miles. Next night wee rode one and twenty miles to <HI>Suffedaw,</HI> an old rotten weather-beaten Inn or Carravans-raw, and placed in part of an unsociable Desart. Our next nights lodging was at <HI>Syacow</HI> ten farsangs (or parassangs as <HI>Pliny</HI> calls them) thirty miles English, notable in her Carravans-raw, built from the ground of good free stone, white and polisht, and was the first building of that ma∣teriall I saw in eight hundred miles riding; a word of our last nights jour∣ney. The most part of the night we rode upon a causey broad enough for ten horse abreast, built by incredible labour and expence over a most dreadfull Desart, eeven and affoording a plaine Horizon of boggy loose ground, cover'd a top, a yards depth with pure salt, as white as snow; a mi∣serable passage, for if either the wind force the salt abroad like dust, or that by any accident Horse or Camell mistake the way, the quaggy bogg up∣holds them not, but suffers them to sinck past all recoverie; a passage more feared, from some forlorne hopes that pillage passengers; God be blest, wee escaped this, but not another, little lesse formidable; for wee had no sooner past the salt Desart, but of necessity wee must climb over and about hills, so high and glomerating, as if <HI>Olympus</HI> had beene cut out into Deda∣lian labyrinths. From <HI>Syacow</HI> wee rode next night 22 miles, most part was over other salt vast Desarts wherein thousands have perished, and would yet, did not a like large deepe grounded causey secure the passage: And here we pitcht our Tents, old god <HI>Terminus</HI> in this place limitting <HI>Parthya</HI> from further branching North, from whose high tops looke wee back and memorize her that was once Mistresse of <HI>Asya,</HI> and formidable to the Roman Emperours. In the Scythick tongue shee meanes a stranger, (as <HI>Iustin</HI> in his twelfth book) given by the rude Tartar, as to us the name Welch, by the barbarous Saxon. The Parthyan Diadem was once garnisht with two and twenty Kingdomes, encircling most part of <HI>Asya.</HI> From which lustre shee fell; but after long eclipse, by vertue of the Sophyan stemme, has recover'd a great part of her former bravery. Tis now call'd <HI>Hyerac,</HI> sirnam'd <HI>Agemy,</HI> to distinguish it from that including <HI>Babylon.</HI> Her old Shires were <HI>Rhagaea, Apamea, Tapira, Choama, Araciana, Semina,</HI> and <HI>Mizia;</HI> her mountaines, <HI>Orontes, Abicoronii, Mardoranii,</HI> and <HI>Parchoatri;</HI> not

eight hundred miles in circuit, hilly and barren, yet breeding men both wise and valiant.</P>
<P>Next night (<HI>Diana</HI> running cheerfully through her Zodiac) wee rode eighteene long miles to <HI>Gezz</HI> a pretty Lodge belonging to the King: the greater part of this nights journey was through the bottoms of transected <HI>Taurus,</HI> whose stupendious forehead wets it selfe in the ayery middle re∣gion: the fretum or lane is abut forty yards broad, even below, and be∣strew'd with pibbles; either side is wall'd with an amazing hill, higher than to reach up at twice shooting, and for eight miles so continues, agreeing with the relation <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Solinus</HI> make of it: a prodigious pas∣sage, whether by Art or Nature questionable: I allude it unto Nature (Gods hand-maid.) But if it bee the same which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Caspiae portae; Bertius, Caspiarum Claustra; Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy, Pilae Caspiae, Mediae vel Zagriae;</HI> and <HI>Zarzaeae</HI> by <HI>Dio. Siculus;</HI> I then grant <HI>Semyramys</HI> (who did what she could to eternize her name) effected it, and from her was call'd <HI>Pilae Semyramidae,</HI> as <HI>Niger</HI> has it. Howbeit, the Persians appropriate it to <HI>Mortys-Ally;</HI> who with his slicing Shamsheer for the ease of his people made it; a sword after their Cabala a hundred cubits long; and where∣with at one blow he beheaded ten (or as some say, a hundred) thousand Christians: of no credit, in that <HI>Pliny</HI> (ere <HI>Mortis-Ally</HI> was horne) thus writes of it, <HI>Ruptura est Montis longitudine octo mill: pass: angustissima,</HI> &amp;c. But though they ratifie their story of <HI>Ally</HI> with an oath, from mee they get no other beliefe concerning it than this. <HI>Hanc fabulam longi temporis mendacia finxit.</HI></P>
<P>Of more certainty is this, a Persian in our company told me. That a dozen yeeres ago, a valiant thiefe with five hundred horse and three hun∣dred Musquets defended this narrow roade against all passengers; none pas∣sing nor re-passing without Tribute. The King of <HI>Larry-Ioon,</HI> and other mountaneers frown'd at his sawsinesse, and threatned his banishment; but such stormes made good musick to his eares: <HI>Abbas</HI> growes cholerick to bee so bearded by an ordinary fellow, and scornes to honour his over∣throw by an Army: for knowing he had many Cavalleers about him, he doubted not by their courages to fetter him: he moves it and proposes a reward: but they had heard the thiefe was of incomparable fortitude and dexterity; so as by long silence <HI>Abbas</HI> findes their feare, and grows pale at it: yet ere hee could give his rage a vent, a bold Armenian under-takes it: the King embraces him, and breaths fresh courage into the hardy Chri∣stian, who excellently mounted, singles out the gladded thiefe, that doub∣ted not to master so faire a beast with small opposall. It was his custome to give good play; usually commanding his company to look on, if one or lesse than five entred the strait; such high confidence had he in his va∣lour and dexterity; in short space they met, but parlee in <HI>Mars</HI> his language; the Armenian (in all points fitted for a sterne encounter) fol∣lowed his blowes with such skill and fury, that after long fight and much bloodshed on either party, upon close hee made death a passage: a victory so irksome to his men (whose lives depended on his safety) that like robd Beares they fell upon the victor Armenian, who had doubtlesse there ex∣pired, had not an Ambush of many brave Coosel-bashaes broke out and
<PB N="166" REF="89"/>
relieved him; by whose sudden assault the wretched theeves were quick∣ly sacrifiz'd unto their Master. The Christian returnes to Court crown'd with a glorious Laurell. <HI>Abbas</HI> addes to his lustre and gives him a brave command, so insupportable to the weak soule of this too-strong Cham∣pion, that to content the King and ground his standing, he renyes his pro∣fession, though an Ocean of teares shed by his beloved countrymen sought to wast him from the Alcoran. But see the end of such Apostacy. Al∣beit the King had cause to hug him in his bosome, so excellent and fortu∣nate prov'd he against the Tartarrs; yet jealosie (rather divine vengeance) so stung old <HI>Abbas</HI> that without any triall or acquainting any man with his reason, hee commands <HI>Lolla-beg</HI> to cut his head off, such time as hee was singing a lullaby to his good fortune.</P>
<P>Our next nights manzeil was at <HI>Halvary</HI> (eighteene miles from <HI>Gezz</HI>) a well built Towne it is, and pleasantly seated, the earth being mellowed by a sweet rivolet, that purls from the tops of <HI>Taurus,</HI> from whose ver∣tue the ground is richly appareld in greene, and requites the painfull hus∣bandman with a happy acknoledgement of Olives, Walnuts, Rice, Wheat, and Wood in great abundance: bidding a sad farewell to that healthy Village, the next night we rode 20 miles to <HI>Periscow i.e.</HI> a broken Moun∣tain: a Town somtimes honoured with the Kings residence; not that the beauty of his house (but ordinary) allures him, choyse hawking, Phesants and other game more delighting him here than any other part of <HI>Parthia.</HI> The Pole is here elevated six and thirty degrees: the Towne is refresht with chrystallin water, sweet and advantagious to the earth and her inha∣bitants: tis built upon the brow of a high (well woodded) divided hill, whose top has beene crown'd with a vast Castle, but now by age or warre (the canckerwormes of all temporaries) is moath-eaten, her ribbs onely appeare, expressing desolation and famine. One <HI>Mahummed</HI> commands the Towne, and keepes the sword and skale, but is I feare dame <HI>Astreas</HI> corrupted servant: no marvell if in a discontented humour shee has left the earth, in <HI>Persia</HI> (especially in <HI>Periscow</HI>) Justice is so odly ballanced. At our entrance into this Towne, (to extort a bribe from the Ambassador) he hangd one Persian, cut off anothers nose, and mutilated a third man, to shew his authority more than otherwise; their fault was, for stealing a trifle of two shillings value from a footman serving the English Agent: another was ready to bee trust up, but a message was sent to my Lord Ambassador, that if hee pleas'd to beg his life it should be granted him: my Lord Ambassador very gladly ransom'd him with somewhat more than a meere complement. Complaint was also made against a Farmour for thrashing a whore against her will; Monsieur <HI>Radamanth</HI> bids geld him, and to hang his stones at her eares as two pendants, the gulph of <HI>Persia</HI> afforded none so pretious: the poore wrench humbly beseecht him to spare his usefull parts, so did his astonisht wife, so as after much medi∣ation of friends and thirty pounds fyne, upon promise to grinde in his owne mill ever after, all is husht, and each part satisfied. But each man cried out, a severe Censor is this <HI>Daraguod.</HI> I read that the barbarous Gaules had such a custome, <HI>si furaverit quod valet</HI> 40 <HI>denar. aut moecha∣bitur, vel castretur &amp;c.</HI> But here many times they have such tricks

<P>After two dayes repose in <HI>Periscow,</HI> we jogd on; the Court then being little more than a hundred miles from us. Our first nights journey from <HI>Periscow,</HI> was to <HI>Gheer,</HI> foure and twenty long miles, and tedious: some part was over terrible hills, other part through whistling dales; in both which we were so weather-beaten with a raging storme of wind and haile bred in <HI>Tartary,</HI> and forc't over the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea (which from hence if the season had permitted wee might have seene) that it not onely tooke away our sight and hearing, but threatned our braines; for in despight of our best skill and closing one with another, it separated us; insomuch as we had hardly recovered our companies, had not the melodious noyse of the braying Mules, and jingling of the Cammells bells revoked, yea untwisted us out of these <HI>Caspian</HI> or <HI>Zagrian</HI> straits; through which, when neither Sunne, nor Moone, nor Starre befriends, whosoever hereafter travell, let them (if they would prevent precipitious falls) borrow <HI>Theseus</HI> his thred, or be content to wander in endlesse labyrinths. From <HI>Gheer</HI> wee rode next night foure and twenty miles, to a small Village whose name I have infortunatly lost: the Frogs (the Bul-bulls or Philomels of this mar∣rish place) it may be were the causers of it, assembled in such troopes, and chirping such lothsome tunes, that we wisht <HI>Iupiter</HI> had been to give them another King: for

To <HI>Aliavarr,</HI> one and twenty miles from the Town of Frogs we rode next night: a very sweet and pleasant place in water, wood, and store of Phe∣sants; a bird in these Hyrcanian Towns, and neere the river <HI>Phasis</HI> in <HI>Men∣grellya</HI> (<HI>Cholcos</HI> of old) originally breeding: <HI>Iason</HI> and his Argonauts first made them knowne to Greece, when hence he forc't their Sheep, bearing fleeces of gold, or gold-meriting fleeces. Next night we got to <HI>Necaw,</HI> five and twenty miles from <HI>Alliavar,</HI> observable in the Kings house, and that the common Mansions and Churches here, differ not in shape from ours of the poorer sort in <HI>England.</HI> Next night wee got into <HI>Asharaff;</HI> a Citie upon the <HI>Mare Caspium.</HI> The Emperour of <HI>Persia</HI> was here, and had long expected the Ambassadour; unwilling to remove hence, till he came, that he might see the extent of his Empire, and lest wee should report in <HI>Europe</HI> that there was no grasse (nor grace) in <HI>Persia.</HI> The Sultan of the Towne and fifty Coselbashaes brought us into <HI>Asharaff,</HI> and usher'd us to our lodg∣ing; I may say us, for the ceremony befitted not so great a person as an Ambassador.</P>
<P>ASHARAFF (or <HI>Ahasuraff,</HI> I dare not say frō <HI>Ahasuerus</HI>) is 2 long miles from the Caspian Sea. It is seated low, and many salt Marishes circum∣volve her; is but meanly watered; no other but a small spring trickling
<PB N="168" REF="90" MS="y"/>
from the Taurisian Mountains drils in two branches thorow it, the broader of which is not five yards over. The ground is reasonable fat, but inculti∣vated: the greater part of her Inhabitants ploughing in <HI>campo martio.</HI> I judge two thousand Families live in this Towne, and no doubt encreases daily, the King having but of late affected this place, his Pallace but newly finished, and <HI>Farrabant</HI> the Hyrcan Metropolis but five miles West remo∣ved hence, where the seat Royall has beene kept for many Ages. <HI>Abasse∣baut</HI> also, two miles hence, surpasses for a curious Summer house, excells all his other houses for a delicate view, Imagery, Hummum, Water-works, and a Forrest stored with game of all sorts: it I say, attracts the King, who (where ever hee stayes long) makes great Cities of small Villages. The Buzzar here is but ordinarie; the Mosques are not to be admired, the Kings Pallace is vast, and notable only in her Gardens: the building itselfe is confusedly divided into three or foure Mohols or banquetting houses, great and gorgeously painted; which, were they united might better de∣light the eye, and cause the Architect to be commended. I will speak more of it at the Ambassadors audience.</P>
<P>The pole Artick is here elevated eight and thirty degrees, seventeene minutes; it is due North from <HI>Spahawn,</HI> as wee observed in our star-light travell, (for the dayes are raging hot, and not to be travell'd in or jeasted with) <HI>Arcturus</HI> was ever just before us: from <HI>Ormus</HI> to this place are a thou∣sand English miles: from <HI>Spahawn,</HI> three hundred and fifty, or there-abouts; as reckoned.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Am∣bassador has Audience.</NOTE>But before I give you a survay of <HI>Hircania,</HI> let mee present an essay of my Lord Ambassadours audience and entertainment. After foure dayes rest, the King (or Emperour, Potshaw they call him) was pleas'd, without long warning to assigne him his day of audience. It was the five and twen∣tieth of May, our Sabbath, and the fag-end of their Ramazen or Lent; ad∣vantageous to the Pot-shaugh, for it spared him the charge of a royall Ban∣quet. My Lord Ambassadour had Sir <HI>Sobert Sherley</HI> in his company, and seven or eight other English Gentlemen, his followers: good reason it was some Sultan or other should have convoy'd and shewed him the way; (the Court being a quarter of a mile distant from our house) but it seemes they wanted breeding, or, that some other mysterie was in it: for, no other than a footman from <HI>Mahomet-Ally-beg</HI> proffer'd a complement, every way so course that the Ambassador had no patience to digest it, save by equall contempt to inculcate in the Persian mode, and send him thanklesse back againe. To the Court at length wee got, no noise, no admirers, saw wee there neither; by which we presumed, the Towne knew not of our going thither, which I wonder at, since <HI>Abbas</HI> of all sorts of honours counted to have strangers at his Court, the highest. At our alighting, an ordinarie Of∣ficer bad us <HI>Hosh-galdom</HI> and usher'd us into a little Court <HI>du guard,</HI> that stood in the center of a spatious Court: in it was no other furniture save a few Persian Carpets spread about a pretty white marble Tanck or Pond fill'd with water: here we all stayed, and for two houres space junketted upon <HI>Pelo</HI> and wine, nothing so good in taste as the materiall they were served in, the flaggons, cups, dishes, plates and covers, being of pure beaten gold; thence, wee were led by many Sultans, thorow a spatious and fra∣grant
<PB N="169" REF="90"/>
Garden which was curious to the eye, and delicate to the smell; to another Summer house, rich in gold imbosments and painting; but farre more excellent in a free and royall prospect; for from the Tarrasses wee viewed the Caspian Sea one way, and another way the tops of <HI>Taurus.</HI> The ground chambers were large, quadrangular, archt and richly guilded above and ont her sides; below, spread with most valuable Carpets of silk and gold: in center were Tancks full of crystallin water (an element of no meane account in these torrid habitations;) round about the Tancks were placed (<HI>pomparum fercula</HI>) Goblets, Flagons, Cesternes, and other Stand∣ards of pure massie gold, some of which were fill'd with Perfumes, other some with Rosewater, with Wine some, and others with choisest flowers: and after wee had rested so long as wee might at full feed our hungry eyes with that food of ostentation, wee were brought thence into ano∣ther square large upper Chamber, where the roofe was formed into an Artificiall Element, many golden Planets attracting the wandring eye to help their motion. The ground was cover'd with richer Carpets than the other were, the Tanck was larger, the materia more rich in Iaspar, and porphyr; the silver purling streame was forced up into another Region, yet seem'd to bubble wantonly here as in her proper center: this sea of rich stone, so deepe and so capatious seem'd an Ocean rather, where the spoiles of shipwracks were conjur'd out to please the appetite of Mydas or god Mammon: so much gold, in vessels, for use and ostentation, being set for us to looke upon, that some Merchants there, adjudg'd it worth twenty millions of pounds sterlin: another watery Magazeen there was, circled with a wall of gold and richest Iemms: no flagons, cups, nor other there, but what were very thick and cover'd with Rubies, Diamonds, Pearles, Emralds, Turquoises, Iacinths, &amp;c. The Chamber was gallery wise, the seeling garnisht with Poetique fancies, gold, and choisest colours; all which seem'd to strive whether Art or Nature should be to a judicious eye more valuable: one <HI>Iohn</HI> a Dutchman, who had long serv'd the King celebrated his skill, to the astonishment of the Persians and his owne advantage: the ground in this roome also was over-layd with such Carpets as befitted the Monarch of <HI>Persia:</HI> round all the roome were placed tacite Mirzaes, Chawns, Sultans, and Beglerbegs, above threescore; who like so many in∣animate Statues sat crosse-legg'd; and joyned their bumms to the ground, their backs to the wall, their eyes to a constant object; not daring to speak one to another, sneeze, cough, spet, or the like, it being held in the Pot∣shaws presence a sinne of too great presumption; In breach of any them fearing his spleen, who (as <HI>Caesar</HI> told <HI>Metellus</HI>) could by the fulgur of his eye dart them dead, sooner then speak the word to have them killed: the Ganimed Boyes in vests of gold, rich bespangled Turbants and choise san∣dalls, their curl'd haires dangling about their shoulders, rolling eyes, and vermillion cheeks, with Flagons of most glorious mettall, went up and downe, and proffered the delight of Bacchus to such would relish it. At the upper end (and surmounting the rest, so much as two or three white silken shags would elevate) sat the Pot-shaw or Emperor of Persia, <HI>Abbas;</HI> more belov'd at home, more famous abroad, more formidable to his Ene∣mies, than any of his predicessours. His Grandeur was this, (circled with
<PB N="170" REF="91"/>
such a world of wealth) to cloath himselfe that day in a plaine red callico coat quilted with cotten: as if he should have said, we might see his digni∣ty consisted in his parts and prudence, not <HI>(furtivis coloribus)</HI> to steale re∣spect by borrowed colours or rich embroderies: crosse-leg'd hee sat: his Shash or Turbant was white and bungie; his waist was girded with a thong of leather, the scaberd of his sword was red, the hilt of gold, the blade for∣med like a hemi-cicle, and doubtlesse well tempered: the Courtiers <HI>(Regis ad exemplum)</HI> were but ordinarily attired. My Lord Ambassador by his In∣terpretor (or <HI>Callimachee</HI> as the Persians name it) quickly acquainted <HI>Shaw Abbas</HI> why hee had undertaken so great a journey; to congratulate his good successe against the common enemy of Christendome, the Turk; to agrandize the traffick of raw silke, and other Persian staple merchan∣dizes; to see Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> purge his honour from those scandalous imputations <HI>Nogdi-Ally-beg</HI> his late Ambassador had blemisht him with; and, that perpetuall amity might be continued 'twixt the two famous Mo∣narks of <HI>Great Brittayn</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pot-shaugh</HI> rose up; and in the Turkish Tongue gave him a gratious answer. To the first, that the Turks were a base people compared with the generous minds and vertue of the Persians; in fifteene battells he had given them ample proofe of their magnanimity, and that no people in the world were to him so odious and offensive. He wisht unity amongst all Christian Princes, the Ottomans grounding their conquests meerely from their discord: which if otherwise, they would readily retreat to <HI>Tarta∣ry.</HI> Concerning Trade, the King of <HI>Great Brittayn,</HI> should if he so pleasd have yearely ten thousand bales of silk delivered him at <HI>Ormus</HI> every Ianu∣ary, and for payment would accept of so many thousand Clothes as would equall in value his raw silks; which as he knew the silk was a farre greater quantity then he could use in his owne Dominions, so were the clothes to him; but he would hazard the venting them by his Merchants, to serve the Tartars, Arabs, Georgians, and Muscovians. And by this, neither we nor he should have any need to traffique or correspond with <HI>Turkie.</HI> It would infinitely redound to his honour and content; for hereby he shoul'd disappoynt the grand Seignior of his yearly customes which he is forct to pay, when his carravans go to <HI>Aleppo</HI> or other parts of <HI>Turkie</HI> to deliver the silk, to the Venetian, Genoan, French, or other European Merchants; and an unexpressable torment and vexation to his heart and soule it must needs be, to see the whole band of <HI>Ianizaryes</HI> maintained meerly out of those his customes. What was this? but to cherish thorns to prick his eyes, or to make the swords of his inveterate Enemies sharp and fitted for his destruction. Concerning <HI>Sherley</HI> he had been long of his acquaintance and done more for him, than any of his native subjects; that if <HI>Nog-dibeg</HI> had layd aspersions unjustly on him, he should have decent satisfaction. It argued indeed <HI>Nogdibeg</HI> was guilty of some heynous cryme, in that he rather choose to kill himselfe, than stand to his purgation from so impar∣tiall a Justice: in some sort he presag'd my rigor, for if he had come, by my head (an oath of no small force) I had cut him in as many peeces as there are dayes in a yeare, and burnt them in the open market with stinck∣ing dogs turds. But touching a perpetuall league of true friendship, with
<PB N="171" REF="91"/>
the Monarch of <HI>Great Brittayne</HI> your Master, I embrace it most heartily and wish them accurst that go about to eclipse it. And you are truly wel∣come (speaking to my Lord Ambassador) that have done me that ho∣nour, none of my famous Predicessors ever had before me: for as you are the first Ambassador ever came hither out of your Nation, so I ac∣count your Master the first of the worshippers of Iesus, and of you in a higher respect than any other Ambassadors: which said, <HI>Abbas</HI> sat downe againe. And whereas all Mahomitans sizeda, or knock their heads against the ground and kisse his foot or garment; most friendly he puld our Am∣bassador downe, seated him close to his side, smiling to see he could not sitt (after the Asiatique sort) crosse-legd: and calling for a bowle of Wine, drunk his Masters health, at which the Ambassador uncoverd his head; and to complement beyond all expectation, the <HI>Pot-shaugh</HI> puld of his Turbant; by discovering his bald head symbolizing his Affection: and after an houres merriment departed. But by what meanes the current of the Kings good will became diverted afterwards I cannot divine. I could afterwards perceive that Mahomitan Princes are terrible crafty or mysteriously politicious: for from that day till we got <HI>Cazbyn,</HI> neither was our Ambassador feasted at Court, neither saw he the King, nor did any other Sultan invite, or come to visite him: we partly found the cause, <HI>Mahomet-Allybeg</HI> was by bribery made our enemy; a Persian lately ad∣vanc't from a base beginning, and for his neat faculty in diving into all mens doings, acquainting the <HI>Potshaw</HI> who grumble, who are contented; by such his parasitick facetiousnesse has ingrost his favour from all others, insomuch as all things passe through this impure conveighance; for whom he loves the King honours, such as he hates the King crushes all to peeces. So that to have his good opinion, each great man out-vies others by guifts and such lincks of corrupt esteeme, insomuch that his An∣nuall commings in, are bruited sevenscore thousand pounds sterling. And well may be, since <HI>Myter-beg</HI> (the overseer of the Kings Harams or Se∣ralios) has a hundred thousand pound yearly, if it be true, some here assured me. <HI>Sors nostra humilior!</HI> poore <HI>Tamer-begs</HI> house at the North end of the Towne imprisond us twelve long dayes and nights, (so long the Court stayd, after we got thither;) where the Sunne darted his outragious beames so full upon us, that no part of the burning Zone could broile more than did <HI>Asharaffe</HI> at that present: but the Sunne did not more torment us all the day time, than those innumerable swarmes of Gnats, Mus-ke-toes, and such like excrements, stung and pesterd us each night; they biting us, we thrashing them like mad folks. Notwithstanding, some better use I desire to make of this time, than in spider-catching: and in the first place commemorate we the Kings justice, (Tiranny I may rather call it) for which, he is famoused above all other Mahomitan Emperors: that by view of others miseries, ours may appeare but reall flea-bitings.</P>
<P>A poore distressed wretch, upon some businesse bestowed a long and tedious pilgrimage from <HI>Cabull</HI> in <HI>India</HI> to this miserable place; where ere he knew how the successe would be, rested his weary limbs upon a field carpet, chosing to refresh himselfe rather upon the coole grasse than be tormented by the mercilesse vermin within the Towne: but poore
<PB N="172" REF="92"/>
man he fell <HI>á malo in pejus,</HI> for snorting in a climacterick houre, the same time the King set forth to hunt and many Nobles after him, his pamperd jade winded and startled at him, the King examines not the cause but sent an eternall Arrow of sleep into the poore mans heart, jeasting as (<HI>Iphi∣crates</HI> did when hee slew his sleepy Centinel) I did the man no wrong, I found him sleeping, and asleep I left him: a comfortlesse complement: poore wretch! happy only in this, <HI>Aeneae magni dextra cecidit!</HI> the Courti∣ers also (as the Negroes in <HI>Manicongo</HI> do, who when their Captain receives a hurt by warre or accident, sympathize by voluntary mayming themselves in the like part) to applaud his justice, made him their common marke; killing him a hundred times over, if so many lives could have beene for∣feited: but how highly soever they extoll their King, I preferre those ancient pagans before him, who out of Natures poetry could sing, <HI>Nulla unquam de morte hominis cunctatio longa est.</HI> A Soldats wife (or concubin if you please to call her) having fed too high, in a lustfull bravado petiti∣ond the King for help, her good man proving too weak to conquer her: a dangerous impudence! the King finds it to reflect upon himselfe, (old at that time, and Master of foure thousand Concubines) he promises her a present satisfaction: he calls his Physitians, and when Phlebotomy was held too meane a remedy, they give an Assinego an ophiat lustfull potion, which inrages the beast, who by a forced connexion, basely glutted her; but in the end banisht her life also. A needy souldier, drawes up a cata∣logue of his good services and closes it in want, humbly intreating favour and some stipend from his god of warre for such and such good services. <HI>In bello non bis peccatur:</HI> for, for his saucinesse he is almost drubd (with ma∣ny terrible bastinadoes on the soles of his feet) to death; and (imitating <HI>Pyso</HI> the cruell Judge in <HI>Seneca, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 16.) examines who it was that writ it: the Clarke apologizes, the King quarrells at his scurvie writing; and that hee should never write worse, makes his hand to bee cut off; giving the poore wretch just cause to ingeminate: <HI>Oh! quam vellem nescirem literas.</HI></P>
<P>Two needy knaves were brought into the Divan, and condemn'd for stealing: many grievous tants the <HI>Pot-shaw</HI> leveld at them, assuring them they deserved death for daring to come so neere his Court, so lousie and so ragged: they confesse they therefore stole, to wrap themselves in better cloathing. <HI>Abbas</HI> is not satisfied with any reason: hee commands two new vests bee brought and to apparell them; but winding sheets had beene more proper; for the executioner forthwith drag'd them away, and upon two sticks most cruelly stak'd them upon their fundaments. Such, and such other was his inhumane pastime during our stay at the <HI>Cas∣pian</HI> sea, enough on such a subject; by the foot of <HI>Hercules</HI> the whole bo∣dy is discerned: for if I should summe up his variety of tortures; his men, men-eating hags of hell; his caniball hounds, his Capigi and their death twanging bowstrings, his ripping mens guts and the like; what could be the effect but an odious remembrance: and such is the hard-hear∣tednesse of Mahomitans, a wicked people for cruell inventions: the ten∣der mercies of the wicked are cruelties: a good man is mercifull to his beast; but nor beast nor men, are here commiserated. And, albeit no∣thing
<PB N="173" REF="92"/>
be more commendable in Princes than Justice, (for it is that that makes them gods) yet clemency is no lesse honourable. <HI>Tully</HI> a heathen could affirme it, in his oration to <HI>Caesar</HI> for the life of <HI>Lygarius:</HI> Thy cle∣mency (O <HI>Caesar</HI>) is most excellent, yea more honourable than thy other vertues: Fortune hath made thee great, Nature advanc't thee higher in thy inclination unto mercy. Nor can they well bee separated. A Prince (exalted above others in dignity and Title) is tyed to an impartiall way, neither hating nor fearing any, but rewarding and punishing as cause re∣quireth; without which, contempt or confusion followeth. But to these of <HI>Abbas</HI> I cannot give the glorious Attribute of Justice: since, if the pu∣nishment exceed the fault, it then degenerates into cruelty: a vice, odi∣ous to God, (the Father and fountaine of mercy:) to men, by imitating their deformities; conceiting any Act, though never so unnaturall (if moul∣ded after such a pattern) good and commendable. And heathen Po∣tentates swerving from the rule of divine Justice, pamper the corrupt ha∣bit and disposition of their minds, out of a monstrous appetite and opini∣on that they are above all law, and may every way inebriate their lust, by sportfull tyranny: such were the inhumane games in the Roman Amphy∣theators: such was the barbarisme, <HI>Xerxes</HI> (as <HI>Xenophon</HI> notes) practiz'd on <HI>Masistes</HI> his brother, &amp; other Satrapaes; such in <HI>Dejoces</HI> (father to <HI>Phraortes</HI>) who utterly exterminated the Persian generosity: such in most Mahume∣dans at this day governing: I cannot chuse but adde the miserable Tra∣gedy of his sonne, the memory whereof is recent through most of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abbas,</HI> by divers Paramours had divers children; many of which hee educated with great cost, care, and experience. Of most hope, fame, and vertue; where <HI>Ismael, Sophy-mirza, Codobanda-Sultan,</HI> and <HI>Emangoly;</HI> foure brave young Princes; the two first, begot on <HI>Gordina</HI> daughter of <HI>Simon-cawn;</HI> the later two, of <HI>Martha</HI> daughter of <HI>Scander-mirza:</HI> both Georgians, both Christians: the first Lady was brought thence by <HI>Kurchi∣ki-cawn;</HI> the other by <HI>Shaw-Tamas-Coolibeg;</HI> both Persians, both favo∣rites: all of them so deare to <HI>Abbas,</HI> that it seemed hee then had got the Elixar of earthly happinesse: his wives were so incomparably beautifull; his favorites so exactly faithfull; his sonnes so lively the characters of his person, policy and courage: reciprocally joying the aged King, and over∣joying the warlike Persians. But it is commonly observed that as the most excellent things fade, perish, and alter soonest: so this admirable candor and perfection in these youthfull Princes quickly vanished, <HI>Saturn</HI> acting it. <HI>Ismael</HI> (when by reason of his innate delight in Armes and many quick signes of magnanimity, the Asiatick world gazed and admired him) in a black infernall cloud of poyson went down to an untimely grave at nine∣teene, in the Meridian of his splendor. <HI>Soffy-mirza,</HI> dogd by a like ad∣verse destiny, though elevated at first for revealing a conspiracy, was in the end, at equall yeeres throwne downe and crusht to death, after the dumb <HI>Capigi</HI> had got a hatefull victory, meere jealosie in the King commanding it. <HI>Emanguly,</HI> ere his popular applause could hatch his ruine, upon confe∣rence with a witch that hee saw (by the Almuten of his nativity) short life attended him, growes fearfull of his Syres inconstancy, and in a deep
<PB N="174" REF="93"/>
disconsolate melancholy evaporates his sad spirits, leaving the expectation of hazard and soveraignty to <HI>Codobanda Sultan,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Soffee,</HI> who (made wise by his brothers miseries) so exquisitly behaved himselfe, in duty to his King, in a pleasing distance to the people; that <HI>Abbas</HI> doates, the peo∣ple celebrate, and an uncontroulable good Fortune seemes to dandle him, Affability, bounty, loyalty, courage, and experience in Armes, at home, abroad, the Persian Monarchy, Turk, Arab, Mogul, and Tartar, admiring, fearing, and commending him in severall Eulogies and acclamations: his owne, left nothing unsaid or uninvented that might honour him; his ene∣mies without giving their thoughts the lye, could not but idolize him: who for all that, (not like our common spirits, efflated by every vulgar breath, upon every act, deifie themselves, and conceit all great addi∣tions of honour under their merits) stood immovable, sorry he grew so popular; modestly chiding them for flattery, condemned himselfe of hypocrisy by suffring his victories to bee so guilded, since what he had or did was but a reflex of his Fathers vertue, which he doubted might suffer an eclipse by his accumulations. Oh! how execrable is this marrow fret∣ting scab of jealousie and envie? it converts that reason which only makes us Men, without any regard of justice, into brutishnesse; yea to exceed in cruelty the most unreasonable, most violent creatures! Is not <HI>Abbas</HI> a King, a Father? does clemency belong to any attribute so properly? Is not <HI>Soffee-Sultan-mirza</HI> a Prince, his sonne? on whom can he more justly conferre his love? in whom should vertue rather dwell? where can there be a better center? poore Prince! the path he treads to adde lustre to his Fathers Diadem, to do his Country good, to be accounted commendable; betrayes his steps, and intices him to an affrighting precipice: the more he labours to delight his Father, it serves as fuell to an unjust jealousie; the more hee dignifies his countries honour, the more applause the people crowne him with; and <HI>Abbas</HI> feares his popularity: yea so farre cherishes dishonourable thoughts, so much degenerates from paternall piety, that without all pitty or regard of justice (which makes Kings more beautifull and glorious than when circled with a Tyrants sparkling Diadem) hee ru∣minates his speedy destruction. During these his cabinet machinations, the harmelesse Prince brandishes his steele in proud <HI>Arabia,</HI> but after many conquests, himselfe becomes captivated. An Arabian Princesse of good re∣port, great beauty (in such bodies usually are impaled the fairest soules) and other excellent indowments fettered him: but by his bravery and worth quickly redeem'd himselfe and vanquisht her. Such magick has love, such magnetick power is in vertue. By this Lady he had (in few yeeres) two children, <HI>Soffy</HI> and <HI>Fatyma:</HI> no lesse loved by their Syre, than beloved, doated on by the Grandsyre <HI>Abbas;</HI> a strange affection, to distinguish so unnaturally; to separate where nature had so strongly joyned, to hate the graft, and have the fruit endeared to him. But that his hate might flow more currantly and lesse suspected, hee lookes one way and shoots ano∣ther; seekes to inrage by abusing him hee lov'd most dearly, <HI>Magar</HI> an <HI>Arab,</HI> the Princes Tutor, a sober, faithfull, and valiant servant. <HI>Abbas</HI> calls for him, and in leiu of applause or rewarding him for his sonnes noble education, he lends him a sterne frowne, accuses him of pride, and charges
<PB N="175" REF="93"/>
him that hee had bewitcht the Prince with base ambition. <HI>Magar</HI> sees not the venome prepared for him; and therefore in an humble, but confi∣dent excuse, seekes to quiet him; but the better hee apologuiz'd in his owne behalfe, and the clearer hee made the Mirzaes loyalty appeare, the more hee exasperates the King, the higher his rage inflamed: so that first hee amazes him with a volley of rigorous defamations, and in that maze gives the signe, a dreadfull signe: for forthwith the Capigies break out and strangle him. An unparaleld barbarisme! an act so unbeseeming that fa∣mous King, as amongst the common sort to this day it is not credited: but, Fames brazen shrill-mouth'd Trump sounds it abroad, and ere long the Prince (then in action against the Tartar) has notice of his Syres injustice: hee leaves the Camp, and after many signalls of sorrow, beseeches the King hee may know the reason of it: who flashes him this thundring rea∣son, for thy rebellion; he calls heaven to witnesse his integrity and obedi∣ence, but <HI>Abbas</HI> provokes him further, to intrap and have some colour to satisfie the world in his destruction. The Prince madded with heat and passion, imagines hee saw <HI>Magar</HI> a strangling; and in that extasie unsheaths his sword, vowing to rescue him: the King sorrowes not at his distraction, but at this advantage (upon some faire termes disarming him) calls him in∣to another roome, and (pretending he was not very well) goes out, com∣manding seven big-bon'd villanies, deafe and dumbe, through a trap doore to issue upon him, arm'd with bloody minds and deadly bow-strings: their habit and weapons bewray their cruelty, they needed no other interpre∣tors: the Prince admires the cause, and if oratory or other submissive signes of entreaty could have gotten remorse or delay from these hell∣hounds, but till he knew the ground of this unnaturall project, he had af∣foorded it: but, assured they were inexorable, with an incomparable rage and suddennesse he flies upon them, now one, then another receiving such horrid blowes, that (ere they could fasten on him, or insnare him with their ghastly twanging bowstrings) hee sent three of them to the Divell; and long time defended himselfe, offending those blood-hounds with ad∣mirable courage and dexterity, insomuch that had hee mastered any wea∣pon, hee had doubtlesse saved himselfe; but wanting it, his breath failed, and longer his valour could not nourish him, for, <HI>facile est vincere non re∣pugnantem:</HI> so that at last thay fastened their noozes on him, who now was as a dead man; for all which, the villains had triumpht in his further tor∣tures, had not the King prevented it, commanding them to pinnion him, and (before hee could recover his sences) to draw a flaming steele afore his eyes, and so to blind him; forbidding him the sight of what hee loved ever after; wife, babes, friends, soldiers, or <HI>Magars</HI> carcasse: And by this impiety, <HI>Asia</HI> lost her fairest jewell, <HI>Persia</HI> her Crown of honour, and <HI>Mars</HI> his darling.</P>
<P>The losse of so brave a Prince is quickly rumord: All <HI>Persia</HI> mourns, and in many threnodies sing his farewell: his Army swells with passion, but seeing no remedy, by a forced silence murmur their imprecations: the Prince, when he perceived his undoing (the eye of reason lent him such a sight) falls frantick; hee curses his birth, his fame, his loyalty, his cruell parent; and by many contumatious threats, vowes his destruction: but
<PB N="176" REF="94"/>
<HI>vana sine viribus ira;</HI> he findes his revenge impossible; but at that conceit roares hidiously, and is not to be comforted, till <HI>Suliman-mirza, Curchi∣ki-cawn</HI> and other his kinsmen and quondam favorits, flockt about him, and by their miserable examples dictated patience; for none there but in some measure had swolne big with the Kings infusion in their times, and by like jealousie were crusht downe, mutilated, and damnd to perpetuall imprisonment. In those discontented times, <HI>Abbas</HI> kept his Orb, moving like another <HI>Saturn:</HI> now he imagines his Crowne fixt closely to his head, his seat steddy, every way free from stormes and other accidentall causes that might disturb his quiet: he swum hourely in an ocean of delight, and relisht it: but nothing so much inchanted him, as young <HI>Fatyma;</HI> no other Syren was melodious in song, or delicate in feature, save pretty <HI>Fatyma;</HI> if any stood in feare, he is pacified by <HI>Fatyma;</HI> Court and Kingdome admired his love, but joyed at it; for by this Lady they found a way to expell his rage, and how to pleasure him; the prisoners also by this <HI>Fatyma</HI> got some livelyhood; for want of which, they were oft times welnigh famished; none (but shee) daring to mediate: and thus by this good infant gained they what formerly they pined for, food and comfort. But what joy findes the blinded Prince, since hee cannot participate: revenge delights him more, that word as musick pleases the infernall fancie of this melancho∣ly <HI>Mirza,</HI> not caring how detestable, so <HI>Abbas</HI> suffered. The Divell inspires new rage, and blowes the coales of (more than cruell) assassination: for albeit he loved <HI>Fatima,</HI> yet hearing how his Father doated on her, that be∣gets his hate, yea hatches the innocents confusion. Oh! in him behold the savage and transcendent cruelty of cursed man: revenge had plung'd him headlong into a whirle-poole of unnaturall barbarisme; insomuch, as when the pious child came (in an unluckie houre) to bring him comfort, and by all symptoms of duty to expatiate her obedience; the wretch graspes her, &amp; in a lymphatick fury whirles her neck about, unable to un∣twist her selfe from his strong and wrathfull hands, miserable <HI>Fatima</HI> ex∣piring by her hellish Father: and in her, the joy of parents, delight of <HI>Abbas,</HI> candor of <HI>Persia,</HI> and comfort of the distressed, vanishing. The amazed Princesse his wife cries out his sight deceived him, that it was <HI>Fatyma,</HI> little dreaming that he therefore martyr'd her, because <HI>Fatyma.</HI> And, as if that had not beene enough, (to prevent the King of a successor) hearing young <HI>Soffees</HI> voyce, dolorously crying out for <HI>Fatima,</HI> wingd with rage he gropes for him, but by the Princesses interposing, the boy escapt, or else had lost (what he now victoriously enjoyes) the Monarchy of <HI>Persia.</HI> When <HI>Abbas</HI> heard her Tragedy, he growes so outragiously passionate, that many feared he would become his owne executioner. But, when hee had drencht his sorrow in a sea of salt teares, hee moderates his spleen, and revives upon hopes of punishment, and vowes to retaliate him in the height of cruel∣ty: but, receives so terrible a reply from the distracted Prince, who had return'd a million of dismall curses, that he is stupified with amazement: And to end the Catastrophe, after he had tyred out two dayes with much impatience, the third, hee put a period to his loathed life, by quaffing up a cup of deadly poyson: the King shewing needlesse mercy in his solemne buriall. The sad Princesse mewed her selfe up from sight of man; but since
<PB N="177" REF="94"/>
her sonnes comming to the Crowne, whether hee have made her sociable or no I know not: <HI>Abbas</HI> dyed just at our departure. Let us now to ano∣ther subject, and in a briefe description survey the pleasures of <HI>Hyrcania,</HI> which we have partly relished, and are now enclosed in.</P>
<P>HYRCANIA (whether denominated from her fruitfulnesse in Goats, or from <HI>Harcoon</HI> in the Scythic tongue importing solitarinesse, or from <HI>Hadora</HI> as <HI>Montanus</HI> call'd her, I dare not determine;) is now call'd <HI>Mo∣zendram</HI> (a derivative I think from <HI>Mandagarsis</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy</HI>) and <HI>Kabonkara:</HI> by some (whose fancies I approve not of) this Province is call'd <HI>Karizath, Corca, Girgia, Caspia, Steana, Casson,</HI> and <HI>Diurgument,</HI> relatives meerly, of invention; the North is limited by the Caspian sea, the East with <HI>Sa∣gathy</HI> or <HI>Bactria,</HI> the South with Mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> the West with <HI>Medya</HI> and <HI>Armenia. Hyrcania</HI> is most part (a great part wee travelled) woody and champaign; watered with many sweet and spatious (but not navigable) rivers; such be <HI>Araxis,</HI> (descending sayes <HI>Ptolomy</HI> from <HI>Sacapen</HI> or <HI>Sadu∣cen</HI>) <HI>Cyrus, Obsel, Connack, Mazaeras, Bundama, Hydero,</HI> (from the Desarts of <HI>Lop</HI>) <HI>Aragus,</HI> (falsly said to descend from the Molossians) and others, which from the Taurisian Mountains stream violently, and after they have mellowed the humyd earth in many divided branches, wander into the <HI>Mare Caspium:</HI> at this day it abounds with many sorts of beasts, birds, fruits, fish, and villages: Sheep, Buffoloes, Camells, Asses, Goats, Horses, Cowes, Antilopes, red and fallow Deer; with Silkwormes also, and Phe∣sants, Partrich, Quaile, Woodcock, Pellican, Heron, Pouts, Thrush, Hens, Philomels; and in fruits of most sorts; with fishes also, as Trowt, Pike, Carp, Sturgeon, Conger, Lamprey, Tuneys, Gudgeon, Thornback, Cockles, Oysters, Mussells, Crabs, Limpits, Dog-fish, and Cackrell; most of these the Caspian sea affoorded us: and (which we will sequestere from others) with Lyons, Wolves, Wild-catts, Bores, Scorpions, and Tygers, supposed to nurse the people, as sung the Poet
<Q><L><HI>Them with their duggs the Hyrcan Tygres fed.</HI></L>
<L>Hyrcanaeque admorunt ubera Tygres,</L></Q>
Gnatts, Flyes, and Snakes (to our sad remembrances) in insufficient num∣bers. Townes of old were, <HI>Talebrota, Sarramanna, Adrapsa, Sorba, As∣murna, Tapen, Carta,</HI> and <HI>Mauzoca;</HI> lost by protract of consuming time, or from new names as new Inhabitants have succeeded here; at this day are these, <HI>Farrabaut, Asharaff, Periscow, Omoall, Barfrushdea Chacoporo, Caban, Baezd, Darabgier, Gengee, Shamaky, Erez, Bachu, Byldith,</HI> and <HI>Derbent;</HI> flou∣rishing with people, famoused by trade, and admired in her plenty.</P>
<P>The Hircanians are but lately civilized, no longer than since <HI>Shaw-Abbas</HI> in despight of their resistance came amongst them: but how may we cre∣dit the Persians (for 'twas they that told it us) in that at this day, they ex∣cell the Persians, for husbandry, trade in raw silks, and other imployments; such as has made them rich, and famous; yea happy, till the Persian Soul∣diers intermingled &amp; suckt their hony from them: The Hyrcan language is understood by every Persian. Their habit resembles the Irish troozes: upon their heads they weare Piramidall caps of cloth lined with delicate sheeps wooll: the vulgar Hyrcanian take thus represented.</P>

<P>They are generally affable, merry, curious in rarities, and nothing jealous aftet the manner of other Mahomitans: we must not beleeve the merry re∣ports the Persians told us of their virgin curtesies: of old, they thought to have forbad the valiant Greek desired entrance, by twisting one tree to another, (as did our Abbat of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Albons</HI> against the Normans) but hee that had diffected <HI>Gordions</HI> knot (though mysticall,) with equall pollicie subjugated these Hyrcanians.</P>
<P>Upon Whitson-monday wee left <HI>Asharaff;</HI> the King at that same time journeyed into <HI>Medya</HI> to <HI>Casbyn:</HI> our Travells were different, hee went by <HI>Periscow,</HI> but sent us by <HI>Larry-Ioon,</HI> that we might have the better view of those his richest Provinces: this night we lay in <HI>Farrabaut,</HI> a Citie five miles distant from <HI>Asharaff,</HI> late spoken of.</P>
<P>FARRABAVT (or rather <HI>Farrag-baut,</HI> from King <HI>Farrag-zed</HI> (<HI>baut</HI> is garden, <HI>Zed</HI> is sonne,) successor to <HI>Shezyr</HI> sonne of <HI>Iezan Zeddah,</HI> and pre∣decessour to <HI>Tezdgird</HI> the Hyrcanian King slaine by the Romans in the yeere of our Lord God 595. five and twenty yeeres before the hegira or

Tis watered by a fresh streame, forty paces broad; which ari∣sing in mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> bubbles downe, and at this Town incorporates with the briny Caspian: in place of solyd walls, it is ingirt with liquid moats or trenches, planted with willowes and other trees, which give both shade and ornament: the houses differ from the common mode of <HI>Persia;</HI> they be without Tarrasses or flat tops, and resemble ours in <HI>England</HI> rather, in shape, in windowes, and in tyling; the whole Towne brags of three thou∣sand families; of most Note, are the two <HI>Buzzarrs,</HI> equally spatious, neat and beautifull; many choice and fragrant Gardens also condecorate her, which together make a combined beauty though seeming separate: but, more notable than the rest, is a sumptuous Pallace of the Emperours; at the North side of the Citie, whose balconyes view, whose Gardens extend to the <HI>Mare Caspium.</HI> It has two large Courts (comparable to <HI>Fountain bleaus</HI>) either of which expresse an elaborat Art in the skilfull gardiner; paild they are in many shapes, the ground is forced into pretty knots, the spreading Elms, Chenores, and Sicamores surrounding and commixing so pleasantly, so artificially, that from each chamber the prospect is amiable, the eye and smell contending who should surfet soonest of variety. The house is low; but each chamber, high &amp; capacious; rich in work, cōmend∣able in uniformity; we could not enter with our shooes on (a cōmon Assia∣tick trick at meales &amp; houres of devotion; the Romans also used it, as <HI>Terence</HI> in his <HI>Heautont: Accurrunt servi soleas detrahunt, &amp;c.</HI>) some are square, some gallery-wise, but all are arched: three were especially rich and love∣ly; whose sides were set with Mirrors or Looking-glasses; and whose tops or seeling, were gloriously imbost with flaming gold; the casements were of large square Muscovian glasse, cemented with gold; the ground was over-spread with crimson velvet, some stuft with Down; others with mat∣teresses of azure coloured velvet; coverd with Calzoons of bodkin or cloth of beaten gold: and in Winter the Pot-shaugh sleepes either in sheets of costly Sables, or of delicate shagg or sheep wooll of Corasan: in those gallaries of Mirrors the King has sundry representations of venereous gambolls, his Concubines studying by amorous postures to illure his favor, to glut his fancie: the other chambers are richly furnisht, the walls var∣nisht &amp; painted in oyle, but by an uncivill pencil, the genius of some goatish <HI>Apelles;</HI> such Lavaltoes of the Persian <HI>Iupiter</HI> are there, such immodest po∣stures of men and women, nay of Paederastyes, as makes the modest eye swell with shame, the curious smell winde nothing from those artificiall flowers, save loathsome invention. Let us goe cent the Caspyan ayre, and taste the unruly waves, compared with the quiet houses, sweet and whol∣some. The first object are those prams or ships, wherein the Moscovite sailes downe <HI>Volga</HI> (70 mouth'd <HI>Volga,</HI> issuing from the Hyperborean and Rhyphaean hills) and from <HI>Astra-can</HI> (in six and forty degrees) crosse over the Caspian sea, and at this Port or <HI>Demir-cape</HI> (in 40 degrees 20 minutes)
<PB N="180" REF="96"/>
ride at anchor, till they have loaded away raw silks, exchang'd for Sables, usually in March, in Iuly returning; with a good winde they crosse the sea in 8 dayes, though by adverse stormes Sir <HI>Anthony Sherley</HI> was fourescore: these vessells (resembling our old Corraghs, recorded by <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Lucan</HI>) are without ordinance, the Sea is free of Pyrats: they are sowed with hemp and cord (made of the husk of Cocoes,) and have little iron work; the Marriners are as meanly furnist with skill or use of Compasse. Here also we saw many Canoos, of one peece of wood hewd out of some grown Oke (<HI>Hyrcania</HI> has store, yet little used) capable to receive eight men in faire weather without much danger.</P>
<P>The Caspian Sea (call'd by the Persians <HI>Deriob-Mozendram,</HI> by the Arabs as all other Ponds, <HI>Bobar corsun</HI>) is brackish, and very turbulent, yet land∣lock on every side; the <HI>Hyrcanian, Armenian Russ,</HI> and <HI>Tartar</HI> circum∣volving her: nor has shee commerce with any other sea, except it be sub∣terranean with the <HI>Euxine.</HI> They are three hundred miles asunder, yet may admit so vast an intercourse, if wee consider the like (though not so much) in other places: as in <HI>Zioberis,</HI> which springs from <HI>Taurus,</HI> and after thirty miles concealment under ground, againe discovers it selfe and com∣mixing with <HI>Rhodago,</HI> in one streame, wander into the <HI>Caspian;</HI> great <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> at <HI>Aristotles</HI> request made triall by two Oxen, who confirmed it: as also in <HI>Niger</HI> an <HI>Afrique</HI> river, and others in other places. Some vent or other it has questionlesse, otherwise it would overflow or putrifie; for it receives many great and navigable rivers, as <HI>Volga, Araxis, Cyrus, Connack, Obsel, Rhodago, Mazaeras, Hydero, Aragus, Phasis, Ilment, Sirto, Chesel, Oxus, Edel, Rha,</HI> (some call <HI>Volga</HI> so) <HI>Iehun, Habyn,</HI> &amp;c. by many <HI>ostiums</HI> swelling her womb or concave channell.

<P>Foure dayes wee spent in easie journeys upon this remote shoare; the first night wee got to <HI>Chacoporo,</HI> a big Towne; twelve long miles West from <HI>Farrabat,</HI> and upon which, the sea oftentimes beats outragiously: a river, a stones cast over refreshes her, but (if they told us the truth) is not alwayes potable; for one month every yeer it tasts brackish.

<P><HI>Hyrcania</HI> is a continued Forrest, and of all the trees I saw, none excee∣ded the Mulberies, for numberlesse numbers, none more notable for use; ten, yea thirty miles spreading in them: the berries if white, refresht our bellies, the colour our eyes, the leaves our observation. In every Village and Cottage wee might behold sheds fild with industrious people, and in∣riching silk-worms, seaming the seminary of that valuable Fly, so accoun∣ted of through all the world, so advantageous to the Persian Emperour; who from hence (besides those many rich Carpets of silk and gold, silk, silk and silver yeerely woven for their owne uses) extracts an annuall quantity of raw silke, seven thousand six hundred Batmans (or bales I think) expor∣ted through Turkie into Europe, to his great benefit. The silk-worme (as in quality, so in diversity of shape) varies from other wormes: her first generation arising from a small round black sperme (like Gunpowder or Musturd-seed) which by moderate heat increases to an inch, assuming (at first) the shape of a palmer worme, from which resemblance in six months she two times changes: her common food are leaves and boughs of trees; but of all other, the white Mulbery most delights her, strewed dayly all over thier sheds, kept sweet, and warme, and cleanly. Having satiated their usefull appetites, they forthwith become enemy to idlenesse, sur∣cease their creeping, and with their excretiated vertue intwine them∣selves, in some sort making their lawne both winding-sheet and Sepulcher. The silke co-operates with such colours as be laid afore them, white, yel∣low, greene, and sandy. And albeit they be involved, yet are they visible to the eye, such is the transparency of their excrement. Their exterior part, is a pale gold commixt with lemon, rough and hayry. The interior more hard and form ovated, the better to inhume th'included Fly. Whose task being ended, the silken cods or balls are straightway spread afore
<PB N="182" REF="97"/>
Apolloes corruscant rayes, by whose radiant candor the distressed worme is broyld to death; not unlike a glorious miser faelicitating his death, so it be in contemplation of his rich idolatry. And by this expansion the silk becomes much finer and purer, than if shee were suffered from her owne notion to issue forth and break her habitacle: After this the silke cods are thrown into a large caldron, fild with water, and made meanly hot; then, with a penetrated cane the people stir thē about, at once drawing the slimy silke from as many as his instrument can lay hold upon, or convene in ad∣vantage; lastly with a wheele they are turned round; it attracts the silk, and leaves (nothing worth the getting) indivellicated. But that they affoord hony, yeeld wax, build nests, and are a sort of spyder, <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> may conjecture so, but experience derides their supposition. By this time we are got to <HI>Omoall</HI> a City as well known as any other in <HI>Mozendram.</HI></P>
<P>OMOALL, (of old, <HI>Zarama</HI> I imagin) is thought to bee that <HI>Na∣borca</HI> or <HI>Naborea,</HI> where the Oracle of dreames was so much famoused. It is built under the North side of the imperious Mountaine <HI>Taurus;</HI> of such Grandeur, that three thousand Families inhabit in her, of severall countries and languages, Armenians, Georgeans, Hyrcans, Persians, Jewes, Curdies, and Muscovians, who make a Babel of seven tongues amongst them. The place is fruitfull, and blest in present prosperity and antick greatnesse, the ruines compleating the report of her being once Metropo∣lis; the houses at this day are not builded in the meanest fashion, glorying above the rest, in an old but strong and stately Castle, second to none about her; which, besides the well composed Architecture (affoording no small pleasure to the eye) is observable in a deep trench fild with water, of good defence against the pilfering and rodomantadoes of the adjoyn∣ing Taurisians: commendable also in some sweet gardens usefull and de∣lectable: within the Towne and neere the Castle, is a famous Mosque, honoured by foure hundred and foure and forty Princes and Prophets of that Kingdome intombed there, whose Sepulchers raise admiration in the beholders; that especially of <HI>Meer Agowmadeen</HI> is famous, to whose shrine are daily offered serious devotion. As I entred, I found twenty reverent and well apparelled Arabians in a round, close by the Princes Dormitory, with each an Arabic Alcoran before him; out of which, with great modesty and good musick they chanted a dolefull requiem to his ghost; in which they were so serious, that notwithstanding I came sudden∣ly amongst them, and in such a habit as others admired, they sung on and in a Dorick sweetnesse continued till they had finisht that their Threno∣dy; which ended, they arose and bad me heartily welcome, readily poyn∣ting out the rarities of their Temple. Thence, I went to the river side (over which upon a Bridge we rode the night before) hoping to shade my selfe (from outrageous Phaeton) under some Poplars there abounding; but quickly left the place againe: for 7 or eight beautious (but not bashful) Damosells (like so many Dorids) sprung suddenly out from the water, to admire my cloaths, never regarding they were naked; some my hat, my hayre others, other-some thought my spurres an antick. I wondred no lesse at their immodesty, and left them with a frowne, dictating their base carriage and my impatience. And till by inquiry I saw it came from a
<PB N="183" REF="97"/>
greedy novelty, I thought them Layesians: but it seem'd I erred; for when the men (such time as <HI>Phoebus</HI> mounts in his meridian) go to sleep, the women then enjoy the river and coole their heat, in both kinds too much abounding there. Their habit is only a smock of transparent lawne, wrought at hands, neck, and skirt, with an imbroydery of silk and gold; the men are cloathed like the other Hyrcanians. From <HI>Omoall</HI> we travel∣led to <HI>Larry-Iohn</HI> or <HI>Ioon;</HI> (I cannot tell if that <HI>Ionaca</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy</HI>) thirty miles thence; at which place the Kingdome of <HI>Hyrcania</HI> takes end and Mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> or <HI>Taur-achow</HI> beginning. <HI>Taurus</HI> (sayes <HI>Dion. Alexan.</HI>) <HI>Totius Orbis terrarum maximus, sic dictus quod instar Tauri elato capite ince∣dit, &amp;c.</HI> But <HI>Eustathius</HI> thus, <HI>Veteres omnia grandia &amp; robusta Tauros vocavere, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Our journey lay sometimes through inhospitable straits, other times over most stupendious hills; the bredth from one side to another about fifty English miles, from <HI>Omoall</HI> to <HI>Damoan;</HI> the length fifteene hundred: towring in a hedge of hills from <HI>Armenia</HI> to the furthest part of <HI>Indya:</HI> and after two dayes painfull climbing got so high, that wee might see the middle region under us, and we involved in chill exhalations. <HI>Taurus, Mons omnium maximus,</HI> sayes <HI>Aristotle;</HI> yet the sublime height did not dis∣aminate us, as did the danger of descending, the path was so uneven and craggy; yea, the rocks so unskilfully cut out for a passage; that great heed must be taken in the treading or a terrible precipice into a bottomlesse lake indangers us; in one hill for three miles together the way was carved (by some unskilfull workman) in the mid-part of a most horrible aspiring perpendicular Mountaine, the lane in some places a yard, in some but halfe a yard in breadth, so as if by accident two horsemen meet, I could not see how both could have safe passage, nor is it higher than ones head if mounted; a wretched passage! for whiles I was sometimes looking at the wonderfull height above us, and anon casting my sight downwards into that dark Abisse, a rock bending ill-favoredly into the narrow way struck me such a blow, as for a great while I was astonied, and happily delivered from a downfall; a rock, demanding an uncivell tribute from all carelesse passengers. At length wee got safe out of that formidable path of death into the broad and lofty Mountaines, from whence the lying Greekes be∣held <HI>Prometheus</HI> (sonne of <HI>Iapeth</HI> by <HI>Asia</HI> his wife and brother to <HI>Atlas</HI>) cheyned to these rocks, his heart gnawed by a Vultur, for daring (though <HI>Pallas</HI> helpt him up) to steale celestiall flames from <HI>Apollo's</HI> Chariot wheeles, to inspire life into his Images. The mythology is this, from these high Mountaines <HI>Prometheus</HI> first studied and observed the firmamen∣tall motion, the acronicall rising and setting of the Stars and other bodies celestiall, the causes of Meteors, eclipses, and other hidden rarities of nature.</P>

<P>But more usefull to our intellect, is the long time famous'd Mountaine <HI>Albors,</HI> neere this place; infamous in the Pyreē or Temple of Idolatrous Fyre, which has never gone out for fifty Ages. <HI>Strabo</HI> in his fifteen and <HI>Procopius</HI> in his second book of the warrs and jarrs in <HI>Persia</HI> remember it: <HI>Ben-Ionas</HI> also, a vagabond Jew records it. Within the Fane (round and low) is an Altar elevated five steps from the ground: afore this Altar is a Trench or ditch, wherein the Fyre-god is placed; a fire not as is other elementall fire, fed by cumbustibles; but of that, <HI>Prometheus</HI> stole from <HI>Don-Phoebus</HI> Cart-wheeles, or which <HI>Zertoost</HI> their Law-giver stole from heaven, (a cabala of equall truth, and chuse you which likes you best) and is, no doubt in imitation of the Jewish fire which <HI>Moses</HI> comman∣ded should never bee extinguisht or prophan'd, 6 <HI>Levit.</HI> 13, the Devill ever frameing his worship (to make it better accounted of) after the best patterne. In this Tophet, they commonly immolated their little children, and somtimes men of more yeers than discretion, thinking by this volunta∣ry to purchase an (iron) crowne, of (hellish) martyrdome. After he had vow'd himselfe to bee a sacrifice, his friends in great troopes, and with no lesse joy flockt about him; clapping him on the shoulders with this greeting. Hayle, blessed man! When? when wilt thou burne thy impure carcasse, to have it purg'd &amp; made glorious in Paradize? he appoints a day, and they prepare towards the ceremony: the time being come, they as∣semble at his gate; &amp; he issues crown'd with garlands; they mount him upon a Mule, (for after hee has vow'd, hee must no more honour the profane earth with his foot-steps) the <HI>Iesop</HI> annoints him with a hallowed oyle, and after many loving farewells, he incinerates in flame to ashes. Ere his chil∣dren depart, or musick cease roaring, the Priest having consulted with the Devill, tells them their duty; bids them sanctifie themselves, and provide a costly banquet against such a day, when their fathers ghost means to visit them: they leap for joy, and think each houre a day till the time accom∣plishes. At last old Satan comes, that subtle lyar, and in their fathers shape or phantasme, enters amongst them, and at some distance deludes their eyes, and readily satisfies their curiosities; they inquire how Paradize con∣tents him; hee replies, by prospect it is a garden of such delights as are ineffable, but as yet cannot possesse it. They aske why? he tells them, because his will is unperformed; they aske who he left it with, the Priest produces it: the tenor is of one note, his goods must be divided into three, the Altar one, the Priests another, his children a third: without which spell the ghost affrights them ever after.

Here also, upon <HI>Quequits</HI> high hill are some reliques of the furious Gyantesse <HI>Lamasaque,</HI> and of <HI>Arneost</HI> her husband, a Gyant of monstrous shape and proportion: I have forgotten how many score of cubits hee was high, but arm'd hee was (if you will beleeve the Persians) with two hornes as big as the tusks of an Elephant; his eyes were terrible big, his taile like to a Cows, but in fight as powerfull as was that club of <HI>Hercules:</HI> This great theife and his wife were both slaine by Saint <HI>Ham-sha Honcoir</HI> such another souldier as was Saint <HI>Romayn</HI> at <HI>Rohan.</HI> But leaving these <HI>ignes fatui,</HI> let mee draw your eyes to our ensuing journeys: After many laborious steps wee got to a Village called <HI>Ryna,</HI> twelve miles short of <HI>Damoan;</HI> where wee beheld a Castle, so built upon the best advantages of Art and Nature, that it seemes impregnable: above, it wants no ground fitted for ease and warre, sweet gardens fild with fruits and flowers, made happy in a rivolet of pure water springing there, and thence delightful∣ly streaming in many oblique meanders into the bottome.</P>
<P>In this place, five and twenty yeere ago, lived one <HI>Meleck Bahaman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Late cōquest of Mount-Taurus.</NOTE> who like a second <HI>Pluto</HI> commanded many hills and dales in <HI>Gelack</HI> and <HI>Taurus;</HI> a King, albeit confined to the middle region, most commonly for∣ced with great cost and care to uphold his dignity against Tartar and Per∣sian his great cost and quarrelsome neighbours: yet such was his good fortune, policy, valour, and mutuall love twixt him and his subjects, that though often invaded, he stood secure, yea, lived to heare the ruine of many, his late enemies; his only aime tending to preserve what his predecessors had justly made him heyre unto, and that his gray hayres might go in peace to an eternall dormitory. Thus thought <HI>Bahaman,</HI> and added his endeavors to compleat his thoughts. But <HI>Abbas</HI> the ambitious Persian, returning from the conquest of <HI>Mozendram</HI> (forcing <HI>Shalley-mirza</HI> sonne of King <HI>Ab∣dalla-cawn</HI> to become his pentioner) looks up upon <HI>Taurus</HI> which seemed to threaten his undaunted heart, and vowes to bee no longer bearded by that mountanous King, taking his Motto out of <HI>Tacitus, id aequius quod va∣lidius;</HI> charging him also that from his lofty dwelling hee peered into his two Kingdomes <HI>Medya</HI> and <HI>Mozendram,</HI> by that advantage ransacking his Townes, robbing his <HI>Carravans,</HI> illuring his wormes, anticipating his progresse to the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and diverting many rivers into other sources; which springing upon <HI>Taurus,</HI> stream'd gallantly into <HI>Hyrcania</HI> &amp; <HI>Shervan,</HI> without whose felicitating, those Provinces became barren and barbarous. <HI>Meleck Bahaman</HI> readily answers <HI>Abbas,</HI> and finds his drift, comparing him to that fable of the Wolfe who drinking at the spring-head, quarrelled with the silly Lambe for troubling his draught by quenching his flagrant thirst at the stream below. Whiles <HI>Abbas</HI> in an impatient delay resolves to try the chance of war, appointing <HI>Methiculibeg</HI> with an army of Coo∣sel-bashawes to perfect his designes, and not to descend thence without victory.</P>
<P>It could not be so secretly intended, but aged <HI>Bahaman</HI> has intelligence of his immediate purposes. At first it troubled him, in that his gray haires were more propense to ease than tumult. Yet, lest his subjects from his
<PB N="188" REF="100"/>
example might be discouraged, he throwes away his dull thoughts, and as a common father provides for safety, in armes and victualls furnishing his large Cittadell for many yeares siege, yea, omitting nothing that might in∣title him a carefull and expert Souldier. In each defensive place he plants a Garrison, and makes every part naked and comfortlesse where the Ene∣mie might march, that in nothing he might be advantagious to the Persian. That done, he mews himselfe, his Queene, two sonnes, and ten thousand able men in his defended Castle, not fearing any thing they could attempt against him. The Persian generall with thirty thousand men mount up∣wards and at their first ascent, find the way so tedious, made more dange∣rous by many dismall showres of Darts and stones thundering on them, that they grumbled at such stratagems, and would needs tumble downe againe, till <HI>Methiculibeg</HI> by many promises of reward, and exposing his owne head in the front of danger drew them up, and after some petty skir∣mishes, incampt himselfe before this Castle; where he was told, the King and victory was included. When they had long viewd this inaccessible fortresse, they halfe dispaired of subduing it. Such was the height of that Castle, and such the perpendicular ascent, two excellent defences Art and Nature had inricht it with. Some Attempts he made, invalidable; to shoot their Arrowes at it, was one with ayming at the Moone. Small shott they had and many Lances, but of small force to batter rocks; so that after ma∣ny tedious bravadoes (wherein the Persian had stones for payment) the Generall, finding force not valuable, turnes Matchiavillian. He summons them above to parlee with him; which granted, he assaults them with ma∣ny protestations of truce and friendship. And that hee might the better shadow truth, presents the aged King with choise Tulipants, Shamsheers, Pearles, and other guilded baits, meane enough to angle for a Kingdome, intreating him to descend and taste a banquet: solemnly swearing by <HI>Mor∣tus Ally,</HI> the head of <HI>Shaw Abbas,</HI> by Paradise, by eight transparent Orbs, and other panym attestations, that he should have royall quarter, come and goe as pleased him; no other reason inducing his invitation, than a hearty good will hee bore him, and hopes of agreement upon parlee. The peace∣full King, unused to deceit and warres rotten stratagems, swallowes the tempting hook, and is credulous they had no perfidy. His wife and sonnes disswade, adding fresh examples of their hypocrisie. But neither those nor the teares his men shed to beg his stay, vowing their constancie to the last man, could divert his destiny: but downe he goes and findes the Crocodile below ready to embrace him with teares of joy: but after a short banquet, gives him an iron bed; regarding neither vow, honour, nor ingagement. <HI>Bahaman</HI> too late repents his dotage. The Pagan Generall thinks all his owne now, and therefore sends his sonne a message of intreaty upon a Speares point, that if they wisht their fathers safety, an end of warre, truce with <HI>Abbas,</HI> and new Grandeur to their fortunes, they should come down; all which by obstinacie would be forfeited and denied them, yea prove a basis of perpetuall trouble, and a common monumentall shame unto po∣sterity.</P>
<P>Nature, enriches man with reason; Time, with knowledge and expe∣rience. Hence, the two gallant youths, regardlesse of the rodomantadoes
<PB N="189" REF="100"/>
of the fastidious Pagan, commix discretion and pollicy, throw downe this choking answer, They would beleeve hee was an honest man and condis∣cend to any reason, so the King might have his liberty to come up againe; otherwise he might count them Ideots, the villany and perjury to their fa∣ther being so fresh amongst them: from equall reason, they might de∣mand the Castle and Crowne, as them by whom those things subsisted; other satisfaction they would not give so vile a miscreant, this excepted, That the King of <HI>Persia's</HI> ill-grounded ambition would never prosper; that though of long time he had politely avoyded the Epithite of a Tyrant, this would rub afresh his former injustice, yea anatomize him so clearely, that all <HI>Asya</HI> would account him odious: that all the world might tax him of dishonourable avarice, who commanding over many fruitfull Provinces, could not rest contented, without subjugating a Nation never wronging him; a King whose Ante-cessors had for more ages govern'd <HI>Larry-Iohn,</HI> than <HI>Izmaels</HI> posterity had done <HI>Persia;</HI> a Country so cold and barren, that of more than Title he could not any way better himselfe: an unholy ostentation.</P>
<P><HI>Sua retinere privatae Domus, de alienis certare regia laus est,</HI> sayes <HI>Taci∣tus;</HI> private men do well to think their owne enough, great ones think all too little for their ambition. <HI>Abbas</HI> must not be circumscrib'd, the General remembers it. So that retorting him this lawlesse title, <HI>Ius mihi objectas, accincto gladio?</HI> without more plea; invites them, from their consoli∣dated cloud, to view their Fathers head off: they resolutely bid him do as pleased him, and to call to minde, murther is inexpiable in their Alcoran. <HI>Methiculibeg</HI> has torne his foxes skin with overstreching it, seeing this de∣vice prove ayre, &amp; knows no way now to blow them up, himselfe is so fine∣ly undermined. But giving his rage a vent, in heat of fury he againe assaul∣ted them, they retaliate his hate with such dexterity that many Coosel∣bashes expir'd their last, and so many others were bruis'd, that they begun a common mutiny, protesting to returne whiles possible, upbray∣ding the Generall, that he knew not how to use a victory, that <HI>Bahaman</HI> was theirs, Mount <HI>Taurus</HI> theirs, and doubted not, but they would do ho∣mage if the <HI>Shaw</HI> would so honour him, that with more credit and gaine they could oppose the <HI>Turk</HI> or <HI>Indyan.</HI> The Generall is plung'd into a deadly Dylemma. If he could infuse patience and make them stay, hee knew not how to mount the Castle; if he returned without full conquest, he knew his head should off; <HI>Ferrat-cawn, Oliverdi-cawn, Kurchichy-cawn,</HI> and other brave Captaines for like faults, being that yeere beheaded. Hee machinates at length another triall; he releases <HI>Bahaman,</HI> upon his knees beseeches pardon: vowing he us'd this seeming discourtesie, but to try his excellent temper; that his leave to go back was granted him, either to go or stay as pleased him; that <HI>Abbas</HI> his Master had sent for him, and that he should depart more joyfully, could he but be so happy to see his sons, whom for valour and policy he admired above all mortall creatures, that if any Articles and Truce might reciprocally bee signed to, oh! what content it would affoord, and fetter him in a thousand slavish ingagements. <HI>Bahaman,</HI> is over-joyed at this Syren, never did musick to his dull eares sound more melodiously; some Magick spell sure had infatuated him; he
<PB N="190" REF="101" MS="y"/>
beleeves the Persian, and gives a Sardonick smile to think how blest hee was in this attonement: he dictates a pathetick letter, and is permitted to shew his joy at a distance to his sonnes. A nefarious messenger delivers it and bewitches the well-nigh distracted Princes with such piscashes and pre∣sents of worth, that accepting them, and joying at the easie Articles, they consult and (fearing to irritate so Potent a neighbour to further mischiefe, the Queene also provoking them downe, contrary to the soldiers who presag'd by many submissive diswasions their ruine) downe they go, rely∣ing on the perfidy of the Generall; who sounds for joy, and carries them to their endeared Father, twixt whom was shewed love and obedience in the height of both; the Generall presents them a solemne banquet, but death attended them. For when these three were blessing their good destiny, smiling in a mutuall consent of love, the Generall gives the signe, and at one instant three Coosel-bashes standing by, with their slicing Se∣miters whipt off their heads, all three at one moment made immortall; and ere this villany was spread abroad, by vertue of their seales, they made the men above descend and yeeld the Castle, some receiving mercy, some destruction. By that detested policy yoaking in slavery, this late thought indomitable Nation; such was the miserable end of <HI>Meleq' Bahaman</HI> and two hopefull Princes, forgetfull of warres subtleties: and how <HI>Aladeule</HI> their neighbour King of <HI>Anti-Taurus</HI> for playing fast and loose with <HI>Selim</HI> first Emperour of <HI>Turqs,</HI> by equall credulity gave a like issue to his life and Kingdome. Opposit to this Castle is erected the Sepulcher of <HI>Ba∣hamans</HI> beloved Queene, in the high-way as wee passed: tis of foure equi∣lateralls, elevated eight yards high; the materiall is of stone, well squar'd and plaster'd with white, very apparant and comely.</P>
<P>A long mile from this Sepulcher and higher up into the Aire, is the high peak of <HI>Damoan</HI> (by <HI>Strabo</HI> in his 11. <HI>lib.</HI> call'd <HI>Iasonia,</HI>) whose top (shaped like a Pyramid) surmounts all the other parts of <HI>Taurus;</HI> up which defa∣tigating hill we crambled with no small difficulty, and from whence wee could discover the Caspian Sea, eightscore long miles distant thence; 'tis above compos'd of sulphur, which causes it to sparkle each night like <HI>Aetna;</HI> a pleasant object to the eye, but is so offensive to the smell, that it requires a nosegay of Garlick in the ascending; hence, most part of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Chaldaea</HI> has their brimstone: the reason why we rode up was out of curi∣osity, to see the baths so generally resorted to, so excellently famous. Three are incircled with strong stone-walls and two are open. The first are for those of quality, the other in common: and hither in August, peo∣ple flock apace from remote parts, decrepit and diseased in mighty mul∣titudes.</P>

<P>Now, whether this hill take denomination from <HI>Damoan,</HI> five farsangs thence, or the Towne from it I cannot argue; but from the signification <HI>a Second plantation,</HI> the Jewes have a Cabala that <HI>Noahs</HI> Ark rested here;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Noahs <HI>Ark.</HI></NOTE> not only from the super-eminency of the hill, but Vines and Zone fitting a seminary better than any part of the Armenian mountains. Besides, this hill where <HI>Taurus</HI> rises up higher than elsewhere, is part of <HI>Paropamisa,</HI> &amp; where <HI>Becanus</HI> places the Ark, denying that <HI>Ararat</HI> is in <HI>Armenia,</HI> though <HI>Hayton</HI> to make it be beleeved, calls it <HI>Aremnoē.</HI> But how improbable so ere that be, this seemes more congruous, that at this Towne of <HI>Damoan</HI> and mountaines about it, the Idolatrous Tribes removed by <HI>Salmanasser,</HI> were here seated; those especially of <HI>Dan, Zebulon, Assur,</HI> and <HI>Nepthaly;</HI> the other of <HI>Ruben, Gad,</HI> and halfe <HI>Manasses,</HI> by <HI>Tiglath Pillesar</HI> about <HI>Lar, Iaarown,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Chusistan.</HI> For albeit <HI>Ptolomy</HI> makes <HI>Gozana</HI> (in his 6. <HI>lib.</HI> 18. <HI>chap.</HI>) a branch of <HI>Oxus,</HI> in above 40 degrees: and at <HI>Ha∣ra,</HI> and <HI>Hala,</HI> and <HI>Ghabor</HI> Cities of <HI>Medya,</HI> neere the river <HI>Gozan</HI> sacred story saies they were placed by the Assyrian; it cannot be that <HI>Gozan</HI> mixes with <HI>Oxus,</HI> since no part of <HI>Medya</HI> is within three hundred miles of it. <HI>Gozan</HI> then is in <HI>Medya;</HI> and seeing that <HI>Araxis</HI> waters <HI>Armenia</HI> from <HI>Ara∣rat,</HI> and runnes into the West side of the Caspian sea; this river here of a great bredth streaming from <HI>Taurus</HI> both into <HI>Medya</HI> and <HI>Hyrcania</HI> (cut in many small rivolets by the people to draw her many wayes) must needs be <HI>Gozan,</HI> and the Jewes inhabiting here for many ages confirme my con∣jecture, saying also that they were brought hither captives, and here have rested during many overtures and changes of the Persian Monarchy.</P>
<P>East of <HI>Damoans</HI> high peak is a Towne call'd <HI>Nova,</HI> in it a hundred fami∣lies. A young man (sonne to <HI>Hodge-Suare</HI> the Persian Merchant that dyed in <HI>London, Anno Domini</HI> 1625, and brother to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> whom we buried at sea) hearing of our passing by, accompanied with all his loving kindred, came to invite us to his home; he was apparelled in a long robe of cloth of gold, his head was wreath'd with a huge Shash or Tulipant of silk and gold, he bestowed a banquet and hearty welcome, with an invitation of longer time: but after mutuall thanks and ceremony, we return'd a long farewell, and thence hastned towards <HI>Damoan:</HI> where, as wee descended a steep hill, wee past by a large black Tent, stuft with above thirty antick women, &amp; as many men; I thought they had been solemnizing their Tau∣rilia and Boalia, but it prov'd a wedding; the bride was of ten yeeres, the groome of thirty; she a <HI>Venus,</HI> he a <HI>Vulcan:</HI> many bride-maids came out to admire at us, wee staid awhile no lesse wondring at them: their faces, hands, and feet were painted in divers formes of birds, beasts, castles, and flowers, resembling our predecessors in <HI>Brittaine</HI> in <HI>Caesars</HI> time; their
<PB N="192" REF="102" MS="y"/>
leggs were chain'd with voluntarie fetters of brasse and silver, which in their Morisco Pastorall made them appeare more excellent in that sport than any description of the Arcadian Sheepheardesses; wee gave them a a small offering and so left them, that night making <HI>Damoan</HI> our Manzeil or Lodging.</P>
<P><HI>Damoan,</HI> (whether the relict of <HI>Ghabor</HI> or <HI>Halah</HI> is incertaine; but by the Jewes (in these parts call'd <HI>Iehuds</HI>) their long captivity and abode here, seemes to be one of them) is a Town well known unto the Persians; some write it <HI>Damawan,</HI> but erroneously. The North Pole is elevated at this place, six and thirty degrees, twenty minutes; longitude 88. It is in∣cluded by the skirt of <HI>Taurus,</HI> in the <HI>Kaboncharion</HI> Province (part of <HI>Ghe∣lack</HI>) and the limit of <HI>Medya,</HI> North; a Towne pretty well watered, a branch of <HI>Gozan</HI> refreshes her: peopled most part with Jewes, who in this place are two hundred Families: The Buzzar is built aloft, and scarce worth the climbing to, except it be to buy wine and fruit, which is had here in plenty and at easie prices. Two dayes wee stay'd in <HI>Domoan</HI> to re∣creat our wearied bodies; on the thirteenth of June we departed thence, and that day rode to <HI>Bomaheem,</HI> five and twenty miles from <HI>Damoan.</HI></P>
<P>And now we are in <HI>Medya,</HI> a word of her; it takes name either from <HI>Me∣deus</HI> sonne to <HI>Iason</HI> and <HI>Medaea,</HI> th'infortunate daughter of King <HI>Aeta;</HI> or from <HI>Madai</HI> third sonne of <HI>Iaphet</HI> sonne of <HI>Noah:</HI> on the North it has mount <HI>Taurus;</HI> has <HI>Parthia</HI> South; confin'd by <HI>Bactria</HI> to the East; West by <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Assyria. Media</HI> was anciently divided into two (as <HI>Trogus, Adephius, Strabo,</HI> and others witnesse,) <HI>Atropatia,</HI> (<HI>Tropataena</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy, Atropataena</HI> in <HI>Pliny,</HI> from <HI>Atropatus</HI> one of <HI>Alexanders</HI> men) and <HI>Azarka</HI> or <HI>Sheervan</HI> i. e. milky Plain.</P>
<P>At this day tis sub-divided into <HI>Gheylan</HI> (<HI>Gheylae</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy, Caddufia</HI> in <HI>Pliny</HI>) <HI>Deylan, Vaaz-pracan,</HI> and <HI>Thezican,</HI> those are <HI>Atropatia;</HI> in which we might include part of <HI>Armenia. Sheirvan</HI> has <HI>Aderbayon, Harran, Sul∣tavia,</HI> and <HI>Tabriztan.</HI> A rich and puissant Country it was in the worlds In∣fancie; but whether by the consuming hand of warre or Gods justice, in revenge of so many holy Christians <HI>Chozroë</HI> massacred, I cannot say; this I can, that it is a barren and miserable soile, compared with the Phoenix of <HI>Iles</HI> great <HI>Brittain,</HI> who in her selfe exceeds the best compacted plea∣sures of these Asiatique Provinces. It has beene fruitfull you may say, if Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the second had good information out of <HI>Strabo. lib.</HI> 11. an Hip∣pobotos or horse pasture here nourishing fiftie thousand breeders; but little grasse is to be found at this day over most part of the Persian Monar∣chy; as you may see, if you please to journey thither. But in stead of them, as many Camells abound here in sandie Desarts, and crop the boughes of trees or shrubs such as they meet with: a beast, albeit generally known, yet may have a small memoriall. The Dromodarie and it are of one descent, but varie according to the Countrie they breed in: in <HI>Bactria</HI> (where of old were reckoned a thousand Cities) and <HI>Persia</HI> they have but one gib or bunch, the Arabian is doubled. The males in one moneth every yeare burne with too much heat, and grow foaming frantick towards copulation, yet in that distraction cannot be brought to commit incest, nor will they goe any whither without their consort: the females are not so cholerick;
<PB N="193" REF="102"/>
they couple backward, goe great ten moneths, commonly have but one young one at one birth, which they suckle two yeares apart from compa∣nie, not loosing their milk till a second conception: They live threescore yeares, labour much, feed little; refraine drink three dayes, but then quench their thirst immeasurably: their milk is cordiall, their flesh ranck and lean, yet in <HI>Asia</HI> preferr'd before Beefe, Veale, Pork, in that <HI>Mahomet's</HI> Alcaron or <HI>Ozmon's</HI> Parady, licentiats it.</P>
<P>This Kingdome was first conquered by <HI>Semeramys;</HI> some say by her simple husband <HI>Nynus, Anno mundi</HI> 1900. <HI>Ninus</HI> was sonne of <HI>Belus</HI> (dei∣fied by names of <HI>Bel, Baal,</HI> and <HI>Iupiter Babylonicus;</HI>) sonne of <HI>Nymrod</HI> (call'd <HI>Mars</HI> by some, by others <HI>Saturne</HI>) sixt sonne of <HI>Cush, Chams</HI> eldest sonne, the cursed brat of <HI>Noah:</HI> or thus, <HI>Noah</HI> had <HI>Cham,</HI> father of <HI>Cush</HI> (begot some say in the Ark) father of <HI>Nymrod</HI> who begat <HI>Baladan,</HI> father to <HI>Berodac</HI> pre∣decessour to <HI>Nabuchadnezar,</HI> father of <HI>Evel-Merodach,</HI> father of <HI>Bel-shazzer,</HI> who (as <HI>Daniel</HI> fore-told) was the last of that Assyrian pedegree, <HI>Darius Medus</HI> supplanting him, <HI>Anno M.</HI> 3426. by some call'd <HI>Cyaxares secundus,</HI> whose daughter and heire was married to <HI>Cyrus</HI> the Fortunate, who by slaughter of <HI>Astiages</HI> became sole Monarch of <HI>Persia.</HI> Since when, it has groaned under twenty changes, but wee will not speak them here; for by this time we are hous'd in <HI>Tyroan.</HI></P>
<P>TYROAN, by her continued greatnesse and Antiquity seemes to be that <HI>Rhazunda,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> It is seated in the midst of a faire large Plain; which albeit it be invironed with hills of stupendious height in most parts at good distance, yet some wayes it affoords a delicate Horizon. The ayre here is fresh and sweet in the morning and towards Sunset, but in the Sunnes perpendicular glances, wee found it hot and ra∣ging: the houses are of white bricks, hardned in the Sunne; above three thousand houses are numbred in <HI>Tyroan;</HI> of which, the Dukes &amp; Buzzar are the fairest and most observable; yet neither so excellent as to beget won∣der: the Market is divided, some part thereof is open and some arched: a sweet rivolet playes wantonly in two streames through the Towne, fer∣tilitating the Groves and Gardens, who for such a favour returne a thank∣full Tribute to the Gardiner: adjoyning the Citie, the King has a spatious Garden, succinct with a great Towring wall of mud, as much in circuit as is the Citie: The house wherein we lodged overtopped all the other, and from whose highest Tarrasse (early one morne) I tooke a dainty prospect both of Towne and Country; every house top was spread with Carpets, whereon each night slept the Master of the house and his Seralio; some (I easily perceived) had three, some six women about them, wrapt in lin∣nen; the curiosity (or rashnesse rather) might have cost me deerely, the penalty being no lesse than to shoot an Arrow into his braines that dares to doe it. The Carravans lodge here, exceeds the Mosque; the men in this Towne are proud, the women lovely, both are curious in novelties; but the jealousie of the men confines the temper of the weaker sexes; yet by that little they adventured at, we might see, <HI>Vetitis rebus gliscit volun∣tas.</HI> One <HI>Zenal-chan</HI> is the Sultan of this Citie, a man of no worth in our opinion: he had been Ambassador from <HI>Shaw-Abbas</HI> to <HI>Rodulph</HI> the second, German Emperour; but his late imployment, his favour with <HI>Abbas,</HI> his

wealth, his vexation for <HI>Nogdi-beg</HI> his Cozen; made him so proud, so dis∣courteous, that albeit the Ambassadour sent to visit him, hee return'd no thanks, he took no notice of his being there. The pole Artick is elevated in <HI>Tyroan,</HI> thirty five degrees, forty minutes: fourescore in longitude. From <HI>Tyroan</HI> we rode to a Village call'd <HI>Charah,</HI> a base inhospitable place; it affoorded us no sustenance, but torment, so much as the scalding sands and frying Sunne could operate, as in too great measure we had experi∣ence of: From hence to <HI>Taurys</HI> is two dayes riding.

It was fifteene Ita∣lian miles about (sayes <HI>Strabo.</HI>) The walls were strong and stately, seventy cubits high and fifty broad, beautified with many loftie Turrets and battle∣ments: within, were numbred many great and excellent Pallaces; that which <HI>Daniel</HI> built (the <HI>Mausoleum</HI> afterwards of the Median Kings) was most magnificent, and which remained undemolisht in <HI>Iosephus</HI> his time, and some whiles after: That, built by <HI>Darius</HI> was no lesse memorable: most part whereof was of Cedar wood, the roofe studded and plaited with burnisht gold; of both which nothing now remaines save memory and ashes. I can hardly say memorie, since it is become a question whether <HI>Tauryz</HI> be old <HI>Ecbatan;</HI> and whether it be in <HI>Media</HI> or no. If to be under <HI>Baronta,</HI> (<HI>Diodorus, Polybius,</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> call it <HI>Orontes,</HI>) if to be in 36 de∣grees 50 minutes, if to have the ruines of <HI>Tobyas</HI> his grave, if to be the bu∣riall place of Kings, if to be the Metropolis time out of mind, if to be the Citie from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> N. E. foure hundred forsangs can make it <HI>Ecbatan;</HI> or if the authority of <HI>Ananias, Petrus de la valle, Leunclavius, Teixera,</HI> and of <HI>Ortelius</HI> will serve, let it then be <HI>Ecbatan</HI> and in <HI>Medya. Ptolomy's</HI> con∣ceit of <HI>Tabryz</HI> (mistaken in the <HI>Tau,</HI> a <HI>Gamma</HI> printed erroniously for it) to be in <HI>Assyria,</HI> by <HI>Cedrenus</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> by <HI>Chalcondyles</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> by <HI>Niger</HI> in <HI>Pers-Armenia,</HI> or by <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> in <HI>Parthya;</HI> what were these con∣jectures but from the Monarchique Arch-Titles, as <HI>Assyrian, Armenian,</HI> or <HI>Parthyan</HI> as they swayed then; and chiefly from the mistake, how <HI>Armenia</HI> is devided; part of <HI>Armenia major</HI> extending South of <HI>Araxis</HI> into <HI>Atro∣patia,</HI> a part of <HI>Medya;</HI> and from whence the name <HI>Pers-Armeniae</HI> is com∣pounded: for by <HI>Abulfeda, Vlughbeg,</HI> and others, the latitude of <HI>Taurys</HI> complies with <HI>Ecbatan.</HI></P>
<P>At this day <HI>Tabryz</HI> is great, and well peopled: traded to from farre, al∣beit it keepes a Garrison. It is compast with a mud wall, five miles about: the houses are flat a top: their materiall Sunne-dried Bricks: the Buzzar large, the Gardens lovely: that to the South-East planted by King <HI>Tamas</HI> was famous, but the Turks horses have lately grazed there. It wants wa∣ter in the greatest measure, yet of that is not wholy destitute. What it lacks in that, fire and flame supplies it; the Sunne, warres rage, and civill broyles having more than sufficiently parched her. To passe by the mu∣tations of the Empire, the Turks first passage six hundred yeares since, <HI>Tamberlayns</HI> rage and the like, remember we those two deadly factions the <HI>Envicaydarlai</HI> and <HI>Namidlai</HI> for three hundred yeares persecuting one ano∣ther with implacable wrath, drawing into their quarrell nine other Pro∣vinces, who grew so hatefull amongst themselves, that not only this Citie but <HI>Medya</HI> &amp; <HI>Armenia</HI> were therby half depopulated: the Gibelyns nor Ro∣ses outmatched them. They made an easie entrance to any invader. <HI>Selym</HI> the grand Signieur first espies it, and to become an eye-sore to <HI>Tamas</HI> sonne

And <HI>Anno</HI> 1530. <HI>Soly∣man</HI> seconded it with so much furie, that it flam'd many dayes, the insa∣tiate Turks pillaging without mercie, and turning topsie-turvie all they met with, and into a Chaos those elaborat walks and gardens <HI>Shaw-Tah∣mas</HI> so much gloried in. It reviv'd againe, and againe is made prostrate to <HI>Ebrahim Bassa's</HI> luxurie, sent by <HI>Solyman</HI> at the villanous instigation of <HI>Vle∣mus</HI> a Persian Traytor, and brother in law to the King. At which time <HI>An∣no</HI> 1534. <HI>Heg.</HI> 914. the greedie Turks new ransackt it. But <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1585. <HI>Heg.</HI> 965. it groaned under most affliction, when <HI>Ozman</HI> the wrathfull Bassa and slave to <HI>Amurat</HI> the third, subdued it, and perpetrated all sorts of hostile crueltie: till thirtie yeares after, by that incomparable Pagan Prince <HI>Emyr-hamze-myrza</HI> elder brother to <HI>Shaw Abbas</HI> it was regained, rebuilt and fortified against the future insolence of those Barbarians. <HI>Tau∣rys</HI> is distant from <HI>Cazbyn</HI> seven dayes easie journey; from the <HI>Mare Caspi∣um</HI> as many; from <HI>Araz</HI> six; from <HI>Derbent</HI> eight, from <HI>Spahawn</HI> seven∣teene, from <HI>Shyraz</HI> thirty, from <HI>Ormus</HI> fifty, and from <HI>Babylon</HI> thirty.</P>
<P>Next night we made our Manzeill at <HI>Sangurrabaut,</HI> a Town consisting of an hundred Cottages. In this place we buried a civill Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Welflit</HI> our comrade, under a broad spreading Chenoar tree, and fixt a brazen scrole over him, which spoke his Name and Nation.</P>

<P>Next night we slept in the open fields under a bespangled Canopie the Firmament; and next in <HI>Shaw-De,</HI> i.e. the Kings Towne, his Purgatorie ra∣ther; if a conspiracie of loose &amp; scalding sand, the burning Sun, and filthie Cottages can make one: the houses there, differ nothing in shape nor closenesse from Ovens; the people all day bake themselves in them; a people so discourteous, that our miserie nothing afflicted them; from that hatefull Towne we hasted, and next night got into <HI>Casbyn.</HI></P>
<P>CAZBYN, (or <HI>Kazvyn</HI> after the lisp of <HI>Persia</HI>) is that same City known to the ancient Topo-graphers by name of <HI>Arsacia,</HI> from <HI>Arsaces</HI> the valiant Persian <HI>Anno Mundi</HI> 3720. from whom the ensuing Kings were stil'd <HI>Arsacidae;</HI> two hundred and fifty yeeres before the th'incarnation of our Savior Christ: and is accounted the first that made <HI>Medya</HI> an Empire, in despight of proud <HI>Seleuchus</HI> son to the great Monarch of <HI>Syria, Antiochus</HI> sirnamed <HI>Theos.</HI> By command of <HI>Nycanor</HI> it was afterwards call'd <HI>Euro∣pus,</HI> and lost that name too when it bended under the next conquest. It is likely this was that <HI>Rages</HI> (a City in <HI>Medya</HI> as appeares in <HI>Tobit</HI>) whither the Angell went from <HI>Ecbatan</HI> to receive the ten Talents (of our money two thousand pounds) <HI>Tobias</HI> was to have from <HI>Gabael</HI> sonne to <HI>Gabrias</HI> his kinsman. I am not ignorant, that some imagine <HI>Edissa</HI> in <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> to be it; but that is most unlikely, for then what businesse had they from <HI>Ninivy</HI> to go to <HI>Ecbatan</HI> (in the way no doubt, or not farre deviat to <HI>Rages</HI>) a contrary way leading to <HI>Edissa</HI> twixt <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates:</HI> besides, it is said in the Apocrypha, that <HI>Rages</HI> was in <HI>Medya, Edissa</HI> is not; and no
<PB N="197" REF="104"/>
part of <HI>Medya</HI> is neerer than a thousand miles from the holy City, but <HI>Edissa</HI> not five hundred. Whence the word <HI>Cazbyn</HI> is fetcht I could not learne; I suppose from <HI>Cowz-van i.e.</HI> a vale of barley; as <HI>Sheir-van</HI> a plain of milke, &amp;c. or from King <HI>Cazvan</HI> as they call <HI>Acembeg</HI> the Armenian; or that it is the relict of <HI>Casbira,</HI> an old City in <HI>Strabo</HI> placed here: for if I should deduce it from <HI>Chazbi</HI> as the 70 Interpreters translate it in <HI>Gen.</HI> 38.5. it would relish of too much antiquity. The signification of <HI>Exile</HI> is un∣known by interpretation or occasion to the inhabitants, except the broa∣cher of that conceit had recourse to the idiom of the old Parthians. The North pole is in this famous City elevated 36 deg. and 15 min. long. 85 degrees 30 minutes: by King <HI>Tamas</HI> (sonne of <HI>Ismael</HI>) made the Metro∣lis of this Monarchy, the better to affront the intruding Ottomans; the Kingdome it stands in, is <HI>Medya;</HI> the Province <HI>Sheirvan,</HI> that part call'd <HI>Deylan:</HI> from <HI>Tabryz</HI> a hundred and eighty miles; from <HI>Hamadan</HI> (the sepulture of Queen <HI>Ester</HI> &amp; <HI>Mordecay</HI>) a hundred &amp; ten; from <HI>Sultany</HI> (the residence of six Sultans) ninety; from <HI>Ardavyl</HI> (the Seigniory of the Aba∣sians) eighty; from <HI>Gheylan</HI> seventy; from <HI>Farabaut</HI> two hundred; from <HI>Sa∣marchand</HI> five hundred; from <HI>Ormus</HI> eight hundred; from <HI>Babilon</HI> five hundred; from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> a thousand; from <HI>Spahawn</HI> two hundred and se∣venty; from <HI>Shyraz</HI> foure hundred and ninety; from <HI>Kandahar</HI> five hundred and fifty miles English, or thereupon.</P>
<P>It is at this day for multitude of buildings and inhabitants the chiefe in <HI>Medya,</HI> and equall for other grandeur to any other City in the Persian Em∣pire, <HI>Spawhawn</HI> excepted. It is seated in a faire even plaine, no hill of note in thirty miles compasse overlooking her; a champaigne yeelding graine and grapes, but little wood saw I growing any where. It has a small streame flowing from <HI>Abonda</HI> (<HI>Baronta</HI> of old) which gives the thirsty drink; and mellowes the gardens: from whence by its refreshment and the peoples industry, they have abundance of fruits and roots and in varieties. I think the reason why wee saw no great rivers in any place, is from their forcing it into many sluces, to bring it by subterranian passa∣ges, to such Townes as have none but by derivative, in so much, that if <HI>Indus, Euphrates,</HI> and <HI>Ganges</HI> were amongst them (I meane where the Country is most peopled) doubtlesse they would make them kisse the sea in five hundred ostiums or branches. Such fruits as I remember, were Grapes, Orenges, Lymes, Lemons, Pomcytrons, Musk and water Mel∣lons, Plums, Cherryes, Peaches, Apricocks, Figgs, Gooseberries, Peares, Apples, Pistachoes, Filberds, Hasel-Nuts, Wallnuts, Almonds, and ex∣cellent Pomgranads, Dates, but such as came from <HI>Laristan. Casbyn</HI> is circled with a complementall wall, of no force in any adversity; the com∣passe is about 7 miles; the families are twenty thousand, people about two hundred thousand, nourisht by the Ayre, and a few roots and rice, such dyet as best complies with such torrid regions. The <HI>Buzzars</HI> here are large and pleasant, but inferiour to some about her. The <HI>Mydan</HI> is uniform and beautifull, the Kings Pallace and Haram are nigh the great Market, low, of raw-bricks, varnisht after the notion of Paynim painting, in blew, red, and yellow tinctures, commixt with Arabiq knots &amp; letters, azure &amp; gold; the windowes are spatious, trellized and neatly carved; within, of usuall
<PB N="198" REF="105"/>
splendor; neere his gate, is a great Tanck or Magazyn of water made at the common charge at our being here. The Hummums (or sweating pla∣ces) are many, resplendent in the azure pargetting and tyling wherewith they are ceruleated; the vulgar buildings content the inhabitants, but to a busie eye yeeld small wonder or amazement: the gardens are best to view and smell to, but compared with those in <HI>Spahawn</HI> and <HI>Shyraz,</HI> prove but ordinary and lesse fruitfull. The Mosq's, or superstitious houses, are not two thirds so many as <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Persia</HI> computed long ago, above six hundred. Nor those so fastidious in Pyramidall aspirings, nor curious in Architecture, nor inside glory as in many lesser Towns obeying <HI>Mahomet.</HI> I cannot inlarge her praises, save that in Spring and Autumne I beleeve it may be a temperate and inticing climat: but Sommer and Winter are ex∣treame in contraries; <HI>Apollo</HI> frying them with his oblique flaming glan∣ces, and <HI>Hyems</HI> no lesse benumming them with his icycles.</P>
<P>Here we met the Pot-shaw again, who got into <HI>Casbyn</HI> two dayes afore us. At which time, forty Cammells entred loaden with Tobacco out of <HI>Indya,</HI> the owners and drivers being ignorant that any such prohibition had gone out, to forbid the using it; (the King sometimes commanding and restrayning three or foure times every yeere, to shew his Monarchic power, and as the humor taketh him,) an ill spirit directed them, for <HI>Mamet-Ally-beg</HI> the pernitious Favorite (wanting his piscash it seemes, ex∣asperates <HI>Abbas,</HI> and he forth-with payes the men unwelcome wages; com∣manding an Officer to crop off their eares, and to benose them; offering to his angry Justice, the forty Cammells burthen of Tutoon or Tobacco, by making a great deep hole the pipe, which being inflam'd, in a black va∣por gave the Citizens gratis two whole dayes and nights infernall incense. Let me give you somewhat to memorise <HI>Casbyn,</HI> wherein have been acted many Tragick scenes, in their times very terrible.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> the purblind King of <HI>Persia</HI> and Syre to <HI>Shaw-Abbas,</HI> of him∣selfe was peaceable and mercifull; but could rest never the quieter for such a temper. <HI>Morad</HI> the third, and sonne to <HI>Selym</HI> that arch-Atheist, and Emperour of Turq's (who call'd himselfe God of the Earth, and com∣mander of the whole World) squinted still upon the Easterne Monarchs, and found none a greater eye-sore and rub to his conquests than <HI>Mahomet</HI> and <HI>Persia:</HI> many attempts he made to subject it, but of no force, the hap∣py influence of destiny so safeguarded it, Nature it selfe laboured to op∣pugne that rebell of Nature.</P>
<P>But let us first look back to see what stormes were rais'd, what incanta∣tions ingendred, ere he could make the tottering Dyadem sit close; <HI>Tamas-Shaw</HI> (sonne to <HI>Ismael-Sophy</HI> the Jewes reputed Messias, till by the just hand of God, they found him crueller than <HI>Tytus</HI>) by a Georgian Lady (they are the rarest in the Orient) had twelve sonnes, <HI>Mahomet, Ismael, Aydar-cawn, Solyman, Emangoly, Mamut-Ally, Mustapha, Ally-cawn, Amet-cawn, Ebrahym, Hamze,</HI> and <HI>Izma-cawn;</HI> the daughters are seldom reckned, yet one of them a Virago, <HI>Periacon-Conna</HI> by name plaid her part, and rather than do as other women, spin or bee imprisoned, shee chose to practice Armes, and to revive the infamy, yea in every thing to imitate <HI>Semyramis.</HI> King <HI>Tamas</HI> was scarce dead (hastned some thinke before
<PB N="199" REF="105"/>
his time) when <HI>Ayder</HI> his third sonne took advantage of his brethrens ab∣sence: <HI>Mahomet</HI> he jeered at, as unworthy the crowne by reason of his imperfection; hee could not see to fight, to discerne, to governe. <HI>Ismael</HI> was abroad upon some imployment, and therefore <HI>Periacon-Conna</HI> encou∣raging, he graspt the Scepter and impald his browes with his Fathers Di∣adem, his brothers right, his owne confusion: for he had not swayed full foure dayes, when <HI>Sahamel-cawn</HI> (his insinuating Uncle) most audatiously struck off the crowne, and (to adde presumption) made the losse of his head satisfie his too hasty ambition. <HI>Zenall-cawn</HI> his friend grumbles at it, but had not power to question him. <HI>Periacon-Conna</HI> finding her ingage∣ment past to <HI>Ayder,</HI> shewes her selfe a right woman in her constancy: for without any revenge of <HI>Ayders</HI> death or sorrowing to his grave, she trans∣fers her love to <HI>Ismael,</HI> who by her foot-post has notice of his brothers ill-end and favour of the Sultans towards him. Ambition lends him wings, so that he quickly arrives at <HI>Casbyn,</HI> and by men of note is joyfully welcom∣ed, by the monster multitude saluted King. His conscience accuses him of intrusion, but checks him not to make such a construction as Law and Nature required from him: he resolves to rule, and to cut off such rubbs as made the way unsafe to mount upon: his brothers had no title to it, (I meane, none but <HI>Mahomet</HI>) yet the name affrights him: 8 innocent Prin∣ces were slaine to quench his infernall inflammation, regarding neither grace, his Fathers soule, the perfume of that name, the name of Tyrant, justice, nor the peoples mutability, who by that cruelty begun to hate him, and to wish the right heyre in his lawfull royalties. <HI>Mahomet</HI> also begins to stirre, if not for the crowne, at least to free himselfe from his brothers blood-thirstinesse; but he no sooner practis'd to bee active, when the peo∣ple ground their loyalty and affection on him, and in great troopes flock about him, vowing to have him King in <HI>Casbyn,</HI> or in the attemp to sacri∣fice themselves. Whiles <HI>Ismael</HI> growes odious to God and Man: for, see∣ing the vulgar sort and others fall away, in a high contempt of them, and to ruine all, he confederates with the Turq, intending to betray the honor of his crowne, and to shade himselfe under their greatnesse; yea to vex his owne, and to ingratiate the Turks the more, apostatizes, proclaiming the error of the Persian reformation, crying out that <HI>Ally</HI> was no body, compared to <HI>Mahomets</HI> three successors, and the like frantick impostures; which how subtlely so ere hee cloakt, his tricks deceived him; for one night (a dismall night to him) his sister weather-cock and foure inraged Sultans, <HI>Chalyle, Emyr, Mohummed,</HI> and <HI>Curchy-cawn</HI> entred his bed-cham∣ber in womens apparell, where <HI>Ismael</HI> thinking to coole his lascivious ap∣petite, was by those Amazons strangled in a cord of silke, foming out his infected spirit, unable to resist the fury of those conspirators, and disheart∣ned when hee saw his sister one of them. <HI>Casbyn</HI> was clouded with shame and amazement, but cleares up when <HI>Mahomet</HI> enters circled with the re∣fulgent Diadem. <HI>Periacon-conna</HI> dreames not of an account: but <HI>Maho∣met,</HI> acquainted with her turbulent and variable nature, commands <HI>Salmas∣mirza</HI> to arrest her with the axe of death, which accordingly hee executes, and sends her Gorgons head, the hayre dishevelling upon a speares poynt as a symboll of his obedience unto the King: her complices upon the ter∣rour

But <HI>Mahomet</HI> is not yet secure, for the Tattars (allyed to the Turk) in revenge upon <HI>Mosen∣dram,</HI> violate and commit all kinds of rage and turpitude, hoping when they had joynd with <HI>Osman-bassa</HI> (left by <HI>Mustapha</HI>) to over-runne all <HI>Me∣dya</HI> without opposall: but they reckned without their host, for <HI>Arez beg</HI> with ten thousand gallant Persians surprise the Tattars with such haste and dexterity, that they routed a great part of the Army, and had return'd crown'd with a most happy conquest, had not <HI>Abdel-chery</HI> the Generall us'd a stratagem, who with some selected companies entring upon the backs of the halfe tyred Persians, by great clamours made them beleeve <HI>Osman</HI> was come; and by that, turn'd the fortune of the day, eclips'd by that interposi∣tion, and made to dy there in an honourable conquest, the cheife Captain <HI>Arezbeg,</HI> unhorst, imprisoned, and at <HI>Sumachy</HI> most basely hang'd, to give the terrified Tattars fresh incouragement.</P>

<P>In <HI>Derbent,</HI> the strong Castle <HI>Kastow</HI> is most observable, pleasant and every way advantagious: that wall also which runnes thence to <HI>Tephlys</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> built by <HI>Alexander</HI> the great (upon like occasion <HI>Offa</HI> drew his ditch to terminate the valiant <HI>Brittans</HI>) call'd also <HI>Caucasiae vel Iberiae portae,</HI> is one of the wonders of <HI>Asia;</HI> but at this day moath-eaten by iron tooth'd Time and warres inconsiderate furie: returne againe.</P>

that the <HI>Tattar</HI> finds himselfe double fettered: but after much parlee and fight they tooke truce and grew so co-united, that the Sultans in <HI>Casbyn</HI> took notice of it; but neither regarding her Majestie nor his youth, forget∣ting also that the King intended to make him his sonne in law (no disho∣nour, being the great <HI>Cams</HI> brother) all these neglected, they broke in, at such an unluckie time as they were acting some inchastity; a sight so odi∣ous to the jealous Sultans, that they first made him an Eunuch, and after that slew them both; concluding so, <HI>Anno Heg.</HI> 958. the end and tryumphs of the Praecopensian Tartar.</P>
<P>After some stay in <HI>Cazbeen,</HI> our Ambassador to swiften his dispatch, vi∣sited the Load-starre of <HI>Persia,</HI> the grand Favorite <HI>Mahomet Ally-beg;</HI> who entertain'd him with a loftie look, and wisht him to trust his secrets to his Cabinet, wherein the mysteries of the whole state was lockt, the King shewing himselfe unwilling to be further troubled. The Ambassadour might in any other place than <HI>Persia</HI> have return'd him the Lye; but per∣ceiving no remedy, and desiring to haste home, imparted so much as hee saw necessarie. Touching Sir <HI>Robert Sherley,</HI> hee was to expect no other satisfaction; his enemie was dead, and at the Caspian sea the King had suffi∣ciently honoured him: but to speak truly, the Pot-shaugh had then no af∣fection to him, when by reason of his age hee was disabled to doe him fur∣ther service; adding (but out of an Enemies mouth) that all his Ambassies and messages to the Princes of Christendome were frivolous and counter∣feit: But when our Ambassadour objected, he was in person there to justi∣fie his authority, that he had the Kings Letter of credence to testifie, sign'd and stampt by the <HI>Shaugh</HI> himselfe; and that it had beene a ridiculous pre∣sumption in <HI>Sherley</HI> to have dared to contest with <HI>Abbas</HI> to his face, if hee had beene an Impostor; the Favorite had not wherewith to answer, save that so our Ambassador pleas'd to lend him that Phirman Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> had brought in his defence, hee would returne it him next day, with his Masters speach concerning it.</P>
<P>A vexation it must needs be to my Lord Ambassadour, to treat in this uncivill sort by a malicious proxy: necessitie forced it. Three dayes passed, ere <HI>Mahomet-Ally-beg</HI> would vouchsafe to returne the Letter, or give that satisfaction he had promised; at length he came and told the Ambassadour that the King had lookt upon it, had denied it to be his, and in a great rage had burnt it; wishing Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> would depart his Kingdome, be∣cause (old, and as hee thought) troublesom. It was in vaine to chalenge the pragmatique Pagan in point of honour, nor knew he any recourse by justice to ease himselfe. We all were verily perswaded, he never shew'd it to the King, nor had any way enquired of him concerning it. The truth is, he had beene brib'd, but by whom, is unnecessarie to speak of, it may be wee did but conjecture it; yet no doubt, <HI>Abbas</HI> was hereby too much de∣famed; his justice, and discretion, and courage would have proceeded otherwise: besides, his protestation against <HI>Nogdibeg</HI> (as wee have noted) and <HI>Ebrahym Chan</HI> his sonne, not daring to shew himselfe in Court, till <HI>Synall Chan</HI> mediated his peace, (not that he, but his Father had offended) made it as apparant as the Sunne, that there was jugling: the truth is, Sir <HI>Robert Sherley's</HI> old age and disability to serve the Persian,

made them sleight and cashier his pension; even then when hee most ex∣pected thanks and other acknowledgements. But, such is the weak na∣ture of man, especially when they trust too much upon worldly Princes or any arme of flesh, that God is angry: for thereby we rely too strongly upon secondarie helps, and contemne in some sort, Gods gracious provi∣dence: hence came those discontents, nay that arrow of Death that arre∣sted him; the 13 of July (and in lesse than a fortnight after our entring <HI>Casbyn</HI>) he gave this miserable &amp; fickle world an <HI>ultimum vale</HI> in his great clymacterick: and (wanting a fitter place of buriall) we intombed him un∣der the threshold of his owne house in this Citie, without much ceremo∣nie. Hee was brother to two active Gentlemen Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> and Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Sherleys:</HI> a family not needing hyperboles. Hee was the greatest tra∣veller in his time, and no man had eaten more salt than he, none had more relisht the mutabilities of Fortune. He had a heart as free as any man: his patience was more Philosophicall than his Intellect, having small acquain∣tance with the Muses: many Cities he saw, many hills climb'd over, and tasted of many severall waters; yet <HI>Athens, Parnassus, Hippocrene</HI> were strangers to him, his Notion prompted him to other imployments: hee had tasted of sundry Princes favours: by <HI>Rodulph</HI> the second hee was created a Palatine of the Empire; and by Pope <HI>Paul.</HI> 3. an Earle of the sa∣cred Pallace of <HI>Lateran;</HI> from whom he had power to legitimate the In∣dians; and from the Persian Monarch had enricht himselfe by many me∣riting services: but obtained least (as <HI>Scipio, Caesar, Bellisarius,</HI> &amp;c.) when he best deserved, and most expected it. Ranck mee with those that honour him: and in that he wants the guilded trophees and hyeroglyphicks of ho∣nour to illustrate his wretched Sepulchre (his vertue can out-brave those bubbles of vanitie, <HI>Facta ducis vivunt:</HI> and till some will doe it better) ac∣cept this <HI>Vltima amoris expressio,</HI> from him, who so long traveld with him, that so much honour'd him.</P>

<P>Nor can it seeme impertinent, if I add somwhat to the deserving Memo∣rie of his Wife, that thrice worthy and undaunted Lady, <HI>Teresia;</HI> to this day constant to our company. The Country shee first drew breath in, is <HI>Cyrcashia,</HI> that which <HI>Pomp. Mela</HI> called <HI>Sargacia;</HI> upon <HI>Palus Maeotis</HI> (ad∣joyning <HI>Georgia</HI>) &amp; 'twixt the black and Caspian seas. Her birth was Christi∣an; her degree Noble: by accident she was mewd in the Haram of <HI>Persia,</HI> (10000 more he never sees:) was of no kin to the King, but by his benevo∣lence
<PB N="204" REF="108" MS="y"/>
bestowed on this man she so long liv'd with, she so much cherished.</P>
<P>At what time her beloved Lord lay dead, and she halfe dead through a long dissentery, to comfort her (after the fashion of <HI>Persia</HI>) one <HI>Iohn</HI> a Dutch man, a Jew, a Painter; regarding neither her sex, her faith, her melancholly; complots with <HI>Mamet-Ally-beg</HI> to undoe her, by pretending a deepe engagement her husband was in to one <HI>Crole</HI> a Flemmin, &amp; (know∣ing hee was dead) bad her ask him if it were not true; if hee denied it, it should be forfeited. She might have pay'd them by like Sophistry, that if he would affirme it, she would pay it them. But, they haste to the Cawsee or Justice to attach her goods, and a faithfull honest Gentleman of our company has quick notice of it, Mr. <HI>Robert Hedges</HI> by name, who hastens to her house and perswades her to make quick conveyance: at which, the amazed Lady tears the Sattin quilt she lay upon, and with her feeble hands shewes that pathetique vertue a stronger could not well have bettered; and taking thence a Cabinet, some Jewells and rich Jems, intreats that worthy Gentleman to safegard them, till the danger was gone: he readily obeyes, and is no sooner out of doores, when <HI>Iohn</HI> the Boor enters with supercilious looks, attended by some Pagan Sergeants, who (without much talk to her, or pitty to her distresse) rifled about, broke-ope her Chests, and carried away what was valuable or vendible; some rich Vests, costly Tarbants, and a Dagger of great price; but finding no Jewells (such they had seene him weare, and the Oestrich Feather also, which they had wooried in their Ostrich appetite) they grew madded with shame, and made her Horses, Camells, and Asses beare them company, not caring if the Lady starved. The Gentleman, so soone as the skie was cleare, re∣turn'd, and besides his words of comfort, gladded her heart in delivering her her Jewels againe, of double value by that conquest: without which good hap, I am perswaded her other fortune reacht not to fifty pound: a small revenue for so brave a Lady; and especially usefull is money in those uncharitable Regions, where women are made slaves to libidinous Pa∣gans: but God provided better for her, and (beyond our expectation) has placed her in <HI>Rome,</HI> where I heare shee now most happily enjoyes her selfe.</P>
<P>Like discontents, long conflict with flames of Adversity, and foureteene dayes consuming of a deadly flux (it may be eating too much fruit, or suck∣ing in too much chil ayre on <HI>Taurus</HI> caused it) brought that religious Gen∣tleman Sir <HI>Dodmore Cotton</HI> the Ambassador, in the vigour of his age, to an immortall home: the 23 of July (14 dayes after Sir <HI>Sobert Sherley</HI>) he bad us <HI>Adieu;</HI> our duty commanding us to see him buried in the best sort wee could. A dormitory we obtained in <HI>Cazbyn</HI> amongst the Armenian graves, who also with their Priests assisted the holy ceremonie: his horse (which was led before) had a black velvet Saddle on his back: his Coffin wee co∣vered with a crimson satten quilt (black they account not of) lyned with purple Taffata; upon the horse were lay'd, his Bible, Sword, and Hatt: Mr. <HI>Hedges,</HI> Mr. <HI>Stodoart,</HI> Mr. <HI>Emmery,</HI> Mr. <HI>Molam, Dick</HI> th'Interpreter, and such others of his followers as were healthy, attended the Corps; &amp; Doctor <HI>Goch</HI> a reverent Gentleman, buried him: where hee rests peaceably till the resurrection: And, although his singular vertue and memorie cannot

perish <HI>(evehit ad Aethera virtus)</HI> yet I wish with all my heart, hee had a Monument; some more eminent memoriall. He was I assure you, <HI>vivum omnis virtutis exemplar;</HI> and I wish I could better expresse my love, than by decking his herse with this impolisht Epicaedium.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>So, after thirty dayes stay in <HI>Cazbyn,</HI> about the midst of July wee de∣parted. But ere we go farre, let us bid farewell to <HI>Mahomet-Ally-beg</HI> our
<PB N="206" REF="109"/>
small friend; and according to his worth let others know him. His birth∣place is <HI>Parthia</HI> (from <HI>Parah</HI> to fructifie,) his Almuten was calculated, the aspects found happy; If from a Costermonger to bee next the King may be call'd happy: and in him the matchavillyan motto was approved, a dram of good fortune is better than a pound of vertue. In that happy minute of all minutes, <HI>Abbas</HI> by accident cast his eye upon him; a magick infusion it had it seemes, for from the Apple-basket, he is roab'd in gold, and quickly made the Magnet of <HI>Persia;</HI> his yeerely revenue at our be∣ing there, I heard by many men estimated a hundred and forty thousand pounds sterlin: and well may bee, not any Mirza, Cawn, Sultan, nor Beg∣lerbeg that depended upon the Pot-shaughs smiles, but in an awfull com∣plement, made him their Anchor by some annuall piscash, bribe, or other: his presence was very comly, and taking; of a sweet countenance, made amiable by many complementall smiles: hee is of a big full body; large eyes and nose; and huge mustachoes: was at this time aged forty, a third part of which hee had beene Fortunes minion. But no sooner was old <HI>Abbas</HI> by bold death struck from the helme of <HI>Persia;</HI> and young <HI>Soffy</HI> his Grand-sonne made the royall Stear-man, but his supercilious glances grew humbled, yea, his dazeling splendor (eclipst in the setting of his Master) becomes quickly darkned: his late pride and avarice heaped all mens con∣tempt upon him, in so much as none now but dares to brand him with becoming Epethites; yea, his estate so vast that it threatned to presse him to eternal cōfusion. Of all others, the Shyrazian Dynast darted him frowns of death; but <HI>(non semper feriet, quodcun{que} minabitur arcus)</HI> a black mist of unexpected destruction fuming from young <HI>Soffees</HI> browes (of the right pedegree) sends poore <HI>Emangoly</HI> to an untimely grave, and the Beglerbeg his gallant sonne to beare him company: neither to be descended of loyall and Princely Syres; to have <HI>Abbas</HI> his oath of safety; to be Protector of <HI>Persia</HI> during the nonage of the Infant King; to have famoused the crown by many heroick services; nor to bee <HI>Emangoly-cawn,</HI> could repell the deadly shaft of jealosie: but in the Meridian of his course and glory, in the extreame of his hopes, and when so long a farewell was least thought on; hee and his are hewed downe; prophesied of by that Satyric Poet. <HI>Ad generum Cereris sine caede &amp; vulnere pauci discendunt Tyranni,</HI> his great pride, his infamous cruelty at <HI>Ormus</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> crying out for justice against him. Whiles <HI>Mahomet-Ally-beg</HI> shakes off his raggs of dis∣content, and a fresh ingratiates himselfe; at this day moving in a spheare of content and purest mettall. A word of <HI>Shaugh-Abbas</HI> also.</P>
<P><HI>Abbas</HI> the Persian Emperour, was of low stature, (a Gyant in policy) his aspect quick, his eyes small and flaming, and without any <HI>palpebrae</HI> or hayre over them: he had a low forehead; a high and hawked nose; a sharp chin; and after the mode of <HI>Persia,</HI> beardlesse; his mustachoes were exceeding long, and thick, and turned downwards. He was born in the yeere of <HI>Mahomet</HI> 938, King of <HI>Hery</HI> 50 yeeres, Emperour of <HI>Persia</HI> &amp;c 43; dyed aged 70; in the yeere of our accompt 1628, of their <HI>Aera</HI> 1008, in <HI>Cazbeen.</HI> His heart, his bowells, his carcasse, were parted and bu∣ried in <HI>Ally-Mosched</HI> (neere <HI>Cufa,</HI>) in <HI>Cazbyn,</HI> in <HI>Ardaveel,</HI> at <HI>Coom</HI> some say, few know the certainty.</P>

<P>The Easterne Monarchs at this day continue the custome of their an∣tient predicessors; who from time to time delighted more in Epethites of vertue, than in any Titles of Kingdomes or Provinces. They accoun∣ted it an effeminate vain-glory to stuffe their letters, or when they sent their Ambassadors abroad to forraine Potentates to guild their greatnesse by accumulation of Names: and in which respect, the German Emperor got little in that late Letter he sent to <HI>Abbas,</HI> the beginning of which was so fild with Titles and members of his Empire, that after hee had heard halfe a dozen of them read, he had no patience to stay the reading of the rest, but departed in anger; as finding those no way materiall to his bu∣sinesse.

<P>COOM, (in the latitude of 34 degrees 40 minutes) is a City of good note, in <HI>Parthia;</HI> placed in the mid-way 'twixt those two royall Cities, <HI>Cazbyn</HI> and <HI>Spawhawn.</HI> It is scituate in an ample and faire sandy plain, and yeelds every way an exact horizon. <HI>Coom,</HI> gives place to no other Towne in <HI>Persia</HI> for antiquity; the ruines appearing at this day, gaine some be∣leife in the inhabitants, whose common saying is, it was once compara∣ble to <HI>Babylon.</HI> She has varied into many severall names: the first I meet with is <HI>Gauna,</HI> it may bee that which some call <HI>Guriana;</HI> erroniously if so, since <HI>Guriana</HI> has 37 degrees; and <HI>Coom</HI> not 35. <HI>Arbacta</HI> after that (from <HI>Arbaces,</HI> who in the yeere after <HI>Adam</HI> 3146 tore asunder the Assyrian Dyadem, by overture of that monster <HI>Sardanapalus</HI> the thirty sixt Monarch of the world from <HI>Ninus</HI>) but by <HI>Diodore</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy, Coama:</HI> And by her latitude and antiquity, seemes to me to have beene <HI>Hecatompylon,</HI> rather than <HI>Spawhawn,</HI> whose old name was <HI>Aspa,</HI> and from which shee never wholly varied; and at this day (the latitude somewhat differing) chang∣ing no lesse in the ill pronunciation of divers men; <HI>Coim</HI> some call it, <HI>Kom</HI> and <HI>Kome</HI> others: the people there name it <HI>Koom.</HI> A pleasant, fruitfull, and salubrious place it is, I can assure you: shaken with no great winds, clouded with no moist foggs, nor so much parcht by flaming <HI>Sol,</HI> but can finde coole refrigerating breezes breathing favourably each morne and evening to refresh it. In the Sunnes ambition it has excellent houses to lenifie his beams, and umbrellaes in their orchards to shade and taste their delicious fruits in, in this City infinity abounding, (owing their mellow∣ing to a sweet rivolet, that streams in a silver current from tke <HI>Coronian</HI> or <HI>Acro-cerawnian</HI> hills,) and grapes also, good and in plenty; excellent Pomgranads, Mellons of both kinds, Pomcytrons, Apricocks, Plums, Peaches, Peares, Pistachoes, Almonds, Apples, Quinces, Cherryes, Figs, wall-Nuts, small-Nuts, Berryes, and the best Wheat-bread in <HI>Persia, Gum∣bazellello</HI> excepted: the Peach or <HI>Malae Persica</HI> is had here; a fruit and leafe so much resembling mans heart and tongue, that the Aegyptick Preists dedicated it unto their greatest Goddesse <HI>Isis</HI> as the truest Hyerogliphick or symbol of unfained affection. <HI>Coom</HI> has two thousand houses, most of them of more than common structure; well-built, well-form'd, well fur∣nished; the streets are spatious, the <HI>Buzzar</HI> beautifull, the Mosque is fa∣mous; made venerable, and richly adorn'd by enshrining the rotten car∣casse of once amiable <HI>Fatyma, Mortis-Ally's</HI> wife, and sole heyre to <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> the Prophet of all Moorish Mussulmen.

From <HI>Coom</HI> we rode to <HI>Zenzen;</HI> and thence to <HI>Cashan,</HI> a gallant Citie; from <HI>Coom</HI> six and thirty miles: the way was easie and plaine, but somewhat sandie.</P>
<P>CASHAN, (where the Artique elevation is 34 degrees, 7 minutes: longit. 86 deg.) is the second Towne in <HI>Parthya</HI> for all sorts of praises; <HI>Spawhawn</HI> is her Metropolis, whence shee is distant North, sixty English miles; and from <HI>Cazbyn</HI> South two hundred and ten, or there-abouts. Whence the name derives it selfe, the illiterat Cashanians could not tell; wee must therefore search the dim leaves of Time oblitterated by obli∣vion. I know not whether it be that old <HI>Ambrodax</HI> in many old Authors famoused; the position not name makes mee guesse it. I once thought it was <HI>Ctesiphon,</HI> the best seat of the <HI>Arsacidae;</HI> but I now perceive <HI>Ptolomy</HI> states that Towne 'twixt <HI>Seleucia</HI> and <HI>Babylon:</HI> more probably it may be that <HI>Tigranocerta</HI> recorded by <HI>Straho</HI> in his <HI>Chorography,</HI> than that <HI>Saway</HI> is it, after <HI>Bonacciolus.</HI> The name <HI>Cashan</HI> I imagine is borrowed either from <HI>Cushan,</HI> in the Syriack signifying heat or blacknesse: or from <HI>Cassan-Mirza</HI> sonne to <HI>Hocen</HI> sonne of <HI>Ally:</HI> or from <HI>Shaw-Cashan</HI> (sonne to <HI>Axan</HI> begot by <HI>Tangrolipix Anno Heg.</HI> 582 of our account 1202,) subjected by the great <HI>Cham:</HI> or (which best pleases me) from <HI>Vsan-Cashan</HI> the Armenian (<HI>Acen</HI> or <HI>Cassan-beg</HI> some call him) who in the yeare of our Lord 1470, of <HI>Ma∣homets</HI> hegira or flight from <HI>Mecca</HI> 850, vanquisht <HI>Malaoncres</HI> (call'd <HI>Ab∣dulla</HI> also) the last of <HI>Tamerlangs</HI> Progeny ruling <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cashan</HI> at this day, is a great and lovely Citie; well seated, well built, well peopled: over-topt by no hill, unseasoned by no marishes, watered by no great streame; which augments the heat, chiefly when <HI>Sol</HI> resides in <HI>Cancer:</HI> which rages there in no lesse violence is <HI>Scorpio;</HI> not that in the Zodiack; but reall stinging Scorpions, which in great numbers in∣gender here. It is a little Serpent (a finger long) but of great terror in the sting, inflaming such they prick with their invenom'd Arrow so highly that some die, none avoyd madnesse a whole day; and as it was said of another <HI>Vna eadem{que} manus fert vulnus opem{que}:</HI> so to such as are stung by Scorpions is no such remedy as by the oyle of Scorpions to be cured.</P>

<P><HI>Cashan</HI> is not lesse than <HI>York</HI> or <HI>Norwich,</HI> above foure thousand families are accounted in her: the houses are fairely built, the streets be large and comly; the Mosqus and Hummums are curiously painted and ceruleated, with a feigned Turquoise: the Buzzar is spatious and uniforme; furnished with Silks, Damasks, rich Carpets, Sattens, and cloth of gold; no part of the Persian Monarchy shewes better, or more variety, nor a people more exactly industrious. The gardens, and fruits, and corne, are by the ele∣borat Tymariots made to fructifie, and being cultivated retribute a gainfull acknowledgement. The Carravans-raw in this Citie is an inimitable (if not so, an unparaleld) Arch Fabrick, by many degrees preceding all Car∣ravans-raws in <HI>Persia;</HI> for this is able to lodge the Court of the greatest Potentate in <HI>Asia:</HI> but built by <HI>Abbas</HI> for Travellers to repose in <HI>gratis,</HI> to shew the world hee joyed in some act of charity: the whole building is grounded with Marble, six foot high; the residue is brick are fied in the Sunne, varnisht and coloured with knots and fancies of Arabick characters, in azure, red, and white, in oyle, after the common mode of <HI>Persia.</HI> It is a perfect quadrant; each angle is from one another two hundred paces, the whole eight hundred: in the umbelique or mid-part of this spatious Court is a quadrangular Tanck or Pond fill'd (by an Aquae-duct) with chrystallin water: this royall Inne, is also circum-volv'd with such fragrant and spati∣ous gardens as rather exceed than want to display the founders magnifi∣cence: more, I have not to denotate, save that many severall conjectures, by many severall learned men and Antiquaries, have passed, whence the <HI>Magi</HI> or wise men came, that presented our blessed Saviour with their of∣frings, and were without doubt the first fruits, and called of the Gentiles: and albeit call'd <HI>Magi</HI> (or deeply read in Nature) yet no question, they were illuminated and wayted the accomplishment of that Prophesie of <HI>Balaam,</HI> in 24 <HI>Num,</HI> 17. <HI>There shall come a Starre out of Iacob and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab and destroy the chil∣dren of Seth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Magi of Persia.</NOTE> They gathered, I say, more from this of their Prophet than any of their own Astrologick observations. That they were Gentiles is apparant; that they came from the East undeniable: but from what Citie or Province, very disputable; though not very necessary. The word <HI>Ma∣gus</HI> is most proper to <HI>Persia; Persia</HI> is East from <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> And many are of opinion they came from hence or <HI>Shushan,</HI> where then flourisht a famous Academy. The people here have such a Tradition, that hence went those three wise men or Kings, which some say were intomb'd in <HI>Cullen:</HI> but few are of this opinion: Some say they came from <HI>Saba</HI> or <HI>Sheba</HI> in <HI>Sabea</HI> or <HI>Arabia,</HI> from <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> South; deceiv'd in <HI>Cush, Aethiops,</HI> but first in <HI>Araby.</HI> From <HI>Babylon</HI> some think they came; from <HI>Shushan</HI> some sup∣pose; from <HI>Ormus</HI> some guesse, as likely as it was Paradise: from <HI>Ceyloon,</HI> from <HI>Tabropan,</HI> from any place, no matter where; since the sacred pen∣men have beene silent in it. But if you please to trust a Frier, Frier <HI>Odoric</HI> of <HI>Friuli</HI> by name, <HI>Cashan</HI> was it. Yet I tie not my beliefe to such imper∣tinencies.

The name <HI>Magi</HI> therefore was a peculiar Epethite in <HI>Persia,</HI> in old times given to such as were learned: such as in other Languages and Nations are called Idiots, Phylosophers, Gymnosophists, Brachmans, Chaldaeans, Druides, and Bardhs; all of them excellently studious in Natures best parts and ver∣tues. <HI>Magus</HI> (sayes <HI>Suidas</HI>) is a derivative from <HI>Magusaeus,</HI> a relative to <HI>Ma∣gog</HI> son of <HI>Iapheth,</HI> son of <HI>Noah.

Wee will confine her into <HI>Babylon:</HI> where shee erected two inimitable Pallaces; one, was at the East end, th'orher, at the West; the first extended thirty, the other sixty furlongs; both were im∣mured with walls of stupendious height and architecture; but excelling those, she built another in the heart or center of <HI>Babylon,</HI> which she de∣dicated to <HI>Cush</HI> or <HI>Iupiter Belus;</HI> the shape whereof was of foure equila∣teralls or sides; from every angle were one thousand, in all foure thou∣sand paces: 'twas circled with a thick and towring wall; entred by foure gates of polisht brasse: in midst, was elevated a strong and stately Tower, upon which, eight other Towers rose one upon another, farre above the middle region: whence (from a continued serenity of the sky) the Priests or Caldaean Astrologers precisely markt the planetary motions (and if pos∣sible, to heare their rowling harmony;) for being above the clouds, they delighted to regard the exact light and magnitude of the Starres; their heliacall, acronicall, matutine, and vespertine motions, rising and falling; <HI>Apollo's</HI> progresse, the constellations; aspects, influences, and the like: and at the top of all, a Turret inricht with three great golden Images or Sta∣tuas, representing <HI>Iupiter, Ops,</HI> and <HI>Iuno,</HI> i. e. her father in law, her husband <HI>Ninny,</HI> and her selfe; continuing there in divine esteeme for many ages; and whereto (sayes <HI>Herodatus</HI>) in way of sacrifice, was yeerly consumed a hundred thousand Talents in franc-incense: till <HI>Cyrus An.

The bridge resembles that at <HI>Rohan</HI> in Normandyl; it has a plain &amp; easie passage over 30 long boats, concatenated and made to separate at pleasure. The Mosque is builded in the West side; large, round, and very pleasantly rais'd of white free-stone, brought from <HI>Mosul</HI> (old <HI>Ninivy.</HI>) The Sultans house adjoynes the great market; it is large but low:

and neere it are some brasse peeces the Turks left there against their will: a little Chappell also, <HI>Panch-Ally</HI> by name, is note-worthy; memorable in the impression of five fingers, <HI>Mortis Ally</HI> by a trick that he had made in the solid stone there. The <HI>Coho</HI> house is a house of good fellowship; in the evening many Mussulmen assemble to sip a sort of Stigian liquour; a black, thick, bitter potion, brewed out of Bunchie or Bunnu berries; more reputed of, in that it increases <HI>Venus,</HI> and purges melancholy: but most of all, from a tradition they have that <HI>Mahomet</HI> sipt no other sort of drink, save this which was first invented and brewed by <HI>Gabryel:</HI> in the Coho house they also inebriate their braines with Aracc and Tobacco. The Buzzar in <HI>Bagdat</HI> is square, and comely. The Gardens are sweet and love∣ly; all put together, shew no more artificiall strength, wealth nor brave∣ry than do many neighbouring and late up-start Townes about her. Twelve miles lower is seene a grosse confused Mount; by some thought the rubbish of <HI>Nimrods</HI> Tower: slimy bricks and mortar may be digd out of it.

<P>SHVSHAN, is every where famoused.

It is spoken of in the 1. <HI>ch.</HI> of <HI>Hester:</HI> That there, <HI>Ahashuerus An. Mun.</HI> 3500. feasted his Liefetenants over a hundred twenty and seven Provinces, a hundred and eighty dayes with great cost and triumph. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> also remember it to bee in <HI>Elam, Persia:</HI> and notwithstanding the many mutations and miseries it had from many avaritious Tyrants, yet was it able to smile upon <HI>Alexander,</HI> when hee extracted thence to pay his Sol∣dats and fill his bags with fifty thousand Talents in Bullyon, and nine Mil∣lions in coyned Gold: and well may bee, since <HI>Cassiodore</HI> in his 7. <HI>lib.</HI> 15. <HI>Epist:</HI> reports for truth, that <HI>Memnon</HI> (sonne to <HI>Tithon,</HI> and reckned by some, first founder) so gloried in his work that hee cemented the stones with gold; which made <HI>Aristagoras</HI> cry out to his men of warre, that if they could but master it, each poore knave there might then compare with <HI>Iove</HI> for riches and bravery.</P>
<P>Some wrangle about the name <HI>Shushan,</HI> and its signification. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> interprets it from her plenty in Lillyes; but whence hee fetcht it I cannot tell; the Arabic nor Persian have no such meaning: as well I may say

from <HI>Suzan</HI> or <HI>Shuzan</HI> in the Persic tongue a needle or a glasse-bottle. But such Synonimaes may not carry it.

<P><HI>PARADISE,</HI> or the terrestriall Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> (<HI>Hogea-del-Holan</HI> the Indians name it) (<HI>Gan-Eden</HI> the Hebre wes call it) wherein God placed <HI>Adam,</HI> is much controverted; and where it was, as much doubted of: some making it an Allegorie, others a locall place. Strange it is to confider the variety. Some say it was in the middle Region of the ayre, whence they will draw the foure great streames that water Paradise. Some place it in the mountaines of the Moone (in <HI>Aethyop</HI> whence <HI>Nilus</HI> springs,) other∣some in the circle of the Moone, some others under the circle, and that thence the foure rivers flow gliding under many large deepe Seas, and so into Paradise. Some think the 4 rivers signifie 4 cardinall vertues; the word Paradise, a metaphor of delight; mans fall, the banishment; the torryd Zone, the fierie sword; and such other fanatick fancies as made the brain∣sick Hermians and Seleucians sweare there never was a Paradise: whose phantasmaes I value not, in that the more judicious affirme there was, varying meerely in the place.

For, knowing wine was strictly forbidden me, shee presents me in an Agony of thirst, a Violl full of old strong intoxicating wine, which relisht curiously, and I powred downe without wit or measure: but (as it had beene so much ophium) it quickly banisht my vitall sences, and put mee for foure and twenty houres into a deadly trance, and in that time (had not a friend resisted) I had beene bu∣ried. But by Gods great mercie, this desperate Potion recovered me. For after I had disgorg'd abundantly, I fell into a sound sleepe (not having done so a moneth formerly, the people admiring such a recovery) so that by benefit of that little rest and binding quality of the wine, I grew every day better and stronger: but my desperate Doctresse (whiles my other servant wept over mee) like an old Hagg, opened my Truncks and robd me of all my linnen and some moneys. I would not pursue her, for then she had died for it. I will therfore say with <HI>David</HI> 71 <HI>Psal.

daughter to <HI>Acrisius,</HI> or from analogie with the Chaldee tongue, imply∣ing a horses hoofe, a hooked nose, or a division, I will not argue. But the Greeks not content with any of them, intitled it <HI>Panchaya</HI> and <HI>Cephoēne;</HI> in memory of their Countryman <HI>Cepheus</HI> (after King of part of <HI>Aethiope</HI>) bro∣ther of <HI>Cadmus, Agenor's</HI> famous children. This same <HI>Cepheus</HI> was father of <HI>Andromeda,</HI> wife to <HI>Perseus,</HI> parents of <HI>Perses</HI> the renowned Archer, living in the world before the building of <HI>Rome</HI> twelve hundred and seventy yeares. <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> some have also named her, and <HI>Magusaea</HI> too, but from whence arising needs no interpreter. Such time as <HI>Achemaenes</HI> son to <HI>Aegeus</HI> King of <HI>Athens</HI> ruled, it got an Achemaenian denomination, as <HI>Lucan, Herodotus, Suidas, Cedrenus,</HI> and others have it: after which race it was new named <HI>Arsaca,</HI> from <HI>Arsaces</HI> the Heroick Parthian not long af∣ter the Incarnation, <HI>Artea</HI> after that, by the Inhabitants importing a noble Country, and from whence many brave Princes assumed names, as <HI>Ar∣taxerxes, Artabanus, Artaphernes, Artaspes,</HI> &amp;c.

From <HI>Candahor</HI> (equi-distant with <HI>Oxus</HI> in <HI>Bactria</HI>) to <HI>Babylon,</HI> East and West, it stretches foure hundred and forty farsangs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent of the Empire.</NOTE> or of English, a thousand three hundred and twenty miles, in seventy dayes usually travelled: and from <HI>Giulphall</HI> (or <HI>Ielphy</HI> neere <HI>Van</HI> in <HI>Georgia</HI>) to Cape <HI>Gwader</HI> in 25 degrees, the furthest part of <HI>Gedrosia</HI> or <HI>Macron</HI> on <HI>Indus,</HI> North and South, foure hundred ninety and six farsangs, or a thousand foure hundred eighty and eight English miles; in eighty dayes commonly journeyed: from which we may compute, the circuit is not lesse than foure thousand miles. The North and East is most part fruitfull in grasse, in corne, in fruit; the South and West (except where rivolets are) sandy, mountanous, sterile, and inhospitable: the vehement

heat scorches the earth and makes it barren; and from whence, the soyle yeelds no exhalations, the mother of clouds, and consequently wants rain to madifie: but in stead of it, God has blest them with frequent breeses.</P>
<P>But how miserable so ere it seemes to others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings revenue.</NOTE> the Persian King makes many happy harvests; filling every yeere his insatiate coffers with above three hundred and fifty seven thousand Tomans (a Toman is five markes sterlin,) in our money, 1190000 pound sterlin: a great revenue, the more to be admired at, since he extracts it from raw silke, customs and cotton; not thinking any way meane or dishonourable that brings in money. So thought <HI>Abbas;</HI> and thence deriv'd that unkinkly trade of sending into the market, his dayly presents of fruits and flowers (for without some piscash was no saluting him,) a kind of thrist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His dome∣stick pollicy.</NOTE> he not only boasted of (I imagin as <HI>Ageslaus</HI> did of his polt-foot) but seemed to complain of the too great nici∣ty of other Kings. And no doubt, if all the Potentates of the earth were inquired after, none would parallell this late old Monach of <HI>Persia</HI> for startagems in good husbandry, (for so, to respect the man, we had best call it.) He could finely dart his wonder upon such &amp; such a Town by report or letter confessing his amazement at sight of some great Elephant, or Tower of gold he heard they had acted: they dare not reason against it, they know the meaning; and in pure gold get such a present; if rich and heavy, then tis dainty work, though never so disordered: if otherwise, then no way praised. Ninety wall'd Townes are under his command (the Villages are above forty thousand) none of which escape his policy; for though they practice nothing lesse than gold-smiths work and imagery, yet hee salutes them with a false report, desiring to see experimentally, whether fame had not beene a niggard in their elevation: they embrace the comple∣ment, and returne him in pure gold the Icon of an Elephant, Cammell, or Dromedary: some a Pegasus, a Cesterne or Bath some send to gaine his love, and some a Babel; or representation of such a great Citie as they know will take him, by comparison: considering which, I lesse admire that vast treasure of Mammonisme, commonly taken out for ostentation at the receit of Ambassadors or Travellers of note; such as in <HI>Mosendram</HI> our eyes were glutted with. In warre, no Asiatick Prince was master of more Art or sure experience; at home, his Genius travaili'd with no fewer fan∣cies, none withou its certaine end to agrandise his treasurie. A Merchant I may also call him, having many thousand factors, frugall and skilfull under him, all which hee sends through the wide universe with each his stock of money, or silke, or carpets to make money of: some of them returne in three, in five some, none exceeds seven yeeres to give their ac∣count, to the Kings infinite advantage: if they have loytered, or acciden∣tally lost, and returne meane profits, they had as good behang'd, hee is so incredulous and wrathfull: but when they come home multiplyed, and with increase, &amp; to his liking, he rewards them with large thanks, a woman from his Haram, a horse, a sword, a Tulipant; but after a small repose packs them abroad againe, re-assuring them of his good affection, and that after such a voyage they shall end their motion in a happie rest, (but seldome does it, till death or diseases force him to it) that they and theirs shall enjoy such necessary summes as conduce to make them fortunate; but in event

Besides, by that law of <HI>Persia,</HI> hee makes himselfe heyre to all that dye, puts the young ones to some way of life, warre, or merchandize; none daring to call his title into question: hee also expects annuall presents from all men of quality; take notice of one mans offring a yeere or two before our being in <HI>Persia:</HI> the Duke of <HI>Sherazz</HI> was hee that sent it: foure hundred sixty and five thousand florens coyned; forty and nine goblets of good gold; seventy two refined silver, and so much of other valuable rarities, as in all, burthen'd three hundred Camells: a gallant present, a sure medicine to expell his melancholy. But this might all be tollerated, were <HI>Astraea</HI> any where adored: but contrarily, abhorred bribery aad corruption in Justice, renders so brave a Prince too much dis∣tempered.</P>

troublesome to one, formidable to the other, to neither convenient, to none honourable. No part of their body is allowed hayre, the upper lip excepted, which growes very long and thick, they turne it downward; the oyle <HI>Dowae,</HI> but thrice applyed annihilates that excrement ever after. The meaner sort reserve a lock in mid their head, of double use, <HI>Mahomet</HI> by that, distinguishing them from other sectaries; and by helpe of it the easier to attaine Paradize: we heare it, they surely beleeve it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habit</NOTE> Their eyes are black, their foreheads high, their noses hooked; about their heads they wreath great rowles of Callico, of silke and gold, higher, more beau∣tifull, and not so bungie as the Turkish Turbants; they call them Shashes, in past times (especially those worne by Kings) Cydarims or Tyaraes, with us call'd Mithers, a little fash or gold fringe hangs downe behinde, the <HI>Arab</HI> taught it them, and serves to distinguish of what quality. The King turnes the contrary side of his Shash forwards, in no other garb diffring from others: in Triumphs and great dayes I have seene them circle their Tulipants with ropes of great orient pearles, with chaines of Rubies, Tur∣quoises and other Stones. The Asiaticks weare no bands, they are the at∣tire of peace (not dwelling there,) their habit or out-side garment is usu∣ally of Callico, stitcht with Silke, quilted with Cotten; the better sort have them of party-coloured silkes, of Satten some, of rich gold, and fil∣ver chamlets others, and some of bod-kin and richest cloth of gold, figu∣red: variety in work and colours pleases them beyond measure, and serve as Emblems of joyes in Paradize: black is not knowne among them, they call it dismall, a type of hell, and unlunluckinesse. Their sleeves are straight and long (to varie from their enemies the Turq' who have them wide and short;) the vest or coat reaches down to their calves, &amp; beares round; their waists are girt with towells of silke and gold above eight yards long, those and the Shashes discover (as they transcend and descend in value) the dignitie of those that weare them. The Dukes have them woven with gold, the Merchants and Cosel-bashes of silver, of silke and wooll, men of inferior quality: next their skin, they weare smocks of cotton, demi∣shirts in length, for colour resembling Scotch plad or Barbars aprons; their breeches are like the Irish trooze, hose and stockings sow'd together: the stocking falls not alwayes into their shooes, from the anckle down giving to the eye two inches naked: their shooes are of good leather and well sowed, but have no latchets; and are of what colour you can fanfie: they are commonly sharp at the toe, and turne upwards; the heeles are high and small, and shod with iron, or nales ingrailed. And this I noted, they do not so much wed themselves to these iron hemi-cycles for thrift or ease, or lasting; (they seldome journey far, or go swiftly) as to tread in a venerable path of antiquity.

Gloves are of no esteeme amongst them; nor rings of gold; of silver they have many: not that gold is lesse valuable (in other things most used) but because <HI>Mahomet</HI> forsooth had his of silver; left to <HI>Ozman</HI> as a legacie, and charm'd with many singular properties: none have their rings of iron, except slaves, and those of baser sort; a mettall they account and call a proper symboll of unnaturall slaverie. They paint their hands into a red or tawnie colour, which both cooles the liver, and in warre makes them (they say) victorious: their nailes are particoloured, white and vermillion; and why so I cannot say, unlesse in imitation of King <HI>Cyrus;</HI> who in augmentation of honour, commanded his Heroes to tincture their nailes and faces with vermillion, serving both to distin∣guish them from the vulgar sort, and (as did our warlike Brittains) in fight to shew more terrible. Their rings are sometimes set with Agats and let∣ters of Arabic conteyning either some spell, their names, or else some fragment of the Alcoran: not one amongst a thousand warriors knowes the benefit or use of letters; the Mullayes and Clergy ingrosse that Art, who when they write do it kneeling; either that that posture is easier, or that what they dictate in that sort, is supposed holy: nor use they goose∣quills, but reeds or canes of great assize and thicknesse; in that they imi∣tate the Antients: their paper is very glossie and varie-coloured, well prest; and the rarer in that their materialls are not raggs or skins, but cot∣ton wooll, course, and requiring much toyle to perfect it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Armes.</NOTE>They seldome go without their swords (shamsheers they call them) form'd like a Crescent, of pure mettall, broad, nd sharper than any rasor; nor do they value them, unlesse at one blow they can cut in two an Afi∣nego; the hilts are without ward, of gold, of steele, of wood; the scab∣bards are well made, of Camells hide, on solemne dayes covered with velvit embroydered with gold and stones of price: they seldome ride abroad without bow and arrow; the quiver and case wrought and cut ingeniously; the bow is short, and (not unlike a crosse bow) bended; and albeit some thinke incomparable in mischiefe to a gun, yet the time has beene they have got with that (as we in <HI>France</HI>) in many parts of <HI>Asia</HI> most memorable battels; as when <HI>Crassus</HI> lost his life, <HI>Valerian</HI> and others, occasioning those dirgees of the Roman Poets, <HI>Terga coversi metuenda Parthi:</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI> thus, <HI>Gens fuit &amp; terris &amp; equis &amp; tuta sagittis, &amp;c.</HI> at this day of no credit in archerie, unlesse they can in a full carreer cleave an Orenge hanging in a string athwart the Hippo-drome, and (when past the mark) with another ready arrow as surely hit the rest, turning (in his

To shew they are servants to dame <HI>Flora</HI> (in her dayes, a good one) they illustrate their armes and hands, their leggs and feet, with painted flowers and birds, and in a naked garb dance every limb about them a Per∣sian Antick, elaboratly making their bells and Cymballs and Timbrells eccho their turnings. Their habit (not unlike themselves) is loose and gaudie, reaching to their mid-leg; of cloth of gold, of satten some, of tissued stuffs or costly inbroyderie. This wanton kind of creature is of no religion, except what the last Monach of <HI>Assyria</HI> (whose Motto was <HI>ede, bibe, lude,</HI>) preached to his Epicures. These look dangerously, drink and stink (of perfumes I meane) horrible strongly; laugh immeasurably, and covet greedily mens soules, moneys, and reputation; scorning all ho∣nest women, and upbraiding them, with the Epethites of slaves, rejected, unsociable, melancholy, and unworthie their speaking to: and it is true at this day what <HI>Trogus Pomp.</HI> observed long ago concerning them, <HI>Parthi Vxoribus &amp; foeminis non convivia tantum virorum, sed etiam conspectu inter dicebant &amp;c.</HI></P>

But when <HI>Mahomet</HI> had insnar'd their soules, and yoakt their necks under Saracenic bondage, the other were rejected as impertinent to this new conquest, advancing as a Symbol of more ex∣cellencie and mystery in their banner, <HI>Mercury,</HI> a Crescent <HI>Luna</HI> with this impreza <HI>Totum dum impleat orbem:</HI> alluding (both in bodie and soule) to an universall command; but how unfitly and meanly borrowed by the French may easily appeare to such as go to <HI>Fountain-b'leau,</HI> where this heathen device is in every hall iterated. But <HI>Mahomets</HI> prediction failed him, when that memorable Saint of <HI>Ardaveil, Gunet,</HI> both obliterated many fundamentall texts of the Alcoran, and invented a new Ensigne in honour of his successor, <HI>viz. Venus,</HI> a Lyon couchant <HI>Sol,</HI> the Sun orient in his face, of the same: minted also in their brasse meddalls (and as a tye of amity) accepted of by the great Mogull, and some other Princes in <HI>In∣dya.</HI> The Cawns, Beglerbegs, Sultans, Agaes, Soldagars, and Coosel-bashes indeed beare no Armes; not that they are intituled slaves, but from their ignorance in pedegrees and heraldrie: and in regard no honour there is hereditarie: but this I can say truly; they are of very humane and noble natures, civill, mercifull, and liberall; yea differ in their ingenuity and love to any Gentleman (that is a stranger) as much from the Turks and their brazen barbarism, as gold is in comparison from iron: for the Persians distinguish degrees amongst themselves, and of other Nations honor high birth and qualitie in any man, yea and give him respect agreeable to his meriting, without any inquirie of his religion. Let us go a little further.</P>
<P>In old times they were Idolaters, such as the Gowers be now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The old Per∣sians.</NOTE> the Per∣sees a sect in <HI>Indya,</HI> the Pegouans, &amp;c. but by converse with Greeks and Ro∣mans abolisht their celestiall worship, and (as <HI>Strabo</HI> relates) received De∣monomanie, continued till <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The transparent Firmament they called <HI>Iupiter,</HI> the <HI>primum mobile</HI> of other gods, him they feared: but, <HI>Apollo</HI> (the Sonne, or <HI>Mithra</HI> as they term'd him) they doated on, and de∣dicated to him many gallant Temples, attiring him with many Epethites of honour, health and gentlenesse: a good opinion then, and not yet can∣celled; as yet memorizing his image in the stamp and coat Armor of their Emperours. The Moone no doubt had due respect and adoration amongst them, supposing her espoused to <HI>Apollo. Venus</HI> had equall reverence: the Earth also, the Water, Ayre, and Fire, wanted not the names of Dieties, especially the Fire and Water. <HI>Zertoost</HI> their Law-giver (in imitation of <HI>Moses</HI>) charged them to keepe a perpetuall fire, not to bee fed with com∣mon cumbustibles, nor to be kindled or inflamed with prophane Ayre, but such as came from the beames of that glorious eye of heaven the Sunne, lightning, flints, or the like. The water also by no means was to be corrup∣ted with dead carkasses, durt, urine, raggs, or what shewed sordiditie or na∣stinesse. They loved images but indifferently; usually actuating their ho∣ly rites, in groves, in mounts, and conspicuous places. Their marriages were commonly celebrated in the spring, such time as <HI>Phoebus</HI> makes the <HI>Aequinoctium;</HI> the Bridegroome the first day juncketting on nothing

save apples and Camels marrow, a dyet proper for that dayes festivall. Po∣ligamy they liked of, the King giving the example, and honouring them with most applause and gratuities who prov'd Fathers of most children. They seldome saw their Infants till past foure yeeres old, from which age to twenty, they learnt to ride, shoot, jaculate, and to speak the truth; as also, to fare meanely, lodge hard, to watch, to till the earth, and to bee content with small things. The old men went plaine; the young mens habit was rich, but in nothing so notable as when their armes and legs were fettered with voluntary lincks and chaines of burnisht gold, whose fulgor they adored from its conformitie with the Sunne: in warre their attire was steely or mailed work, curiously concatenated, their breast-plates skald, their Targets of Oxe hides, large and round, their cap (or helmet) was a Tyara of linen multiplicated; their Armes were darts, bowes, swords, and axes; all which in admirable equipage and order, through long practice they could manage gallantly. Their meales (the great mens tables I in∣vite you to) were splendid in rich furniture &amp; dishes of gold; but in meats, verie ordinary, and sparing, <HI>Bacchus</HI> their countriman taught them the Art of drunkennesse (<HI>Noah</HI> some imagine him, of whom a moderne wri∣ter sayes boldly. <HI>Omnia vero Bacchanalia eorumque ritus a Noae ebrietate originem habent, &amp;c.</HI> followed greedily by these epedemic drunkards, delighted in with no small redundancie; insomuch that (like the Duch at this day) no matter of moment past currant and with applause save what relisht of Bacchisme; yea, their frequent consultations and private bar∣gaines (we too much ape them) were rarely ratified, unlesse negotiated, and consolidated in froath and drunkennesse: Their complements were heartie and not various; to equalls, affoording imbraces; to superiours, bowing the head and knee, to this houre continued without much al∣teration: the rest I offer not, this in my conceit sufficing to parallell the moderne customes, and to set them off with better lustre.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Persi∣ans at this day.</NOTE>The religion of the Persians at this day, I have fitted by it selfe with∣out commixture. Speak wee of other observations.

<P>In peace, they are not alwayes idle; solacing their active bodies in sun∣dry sorts of warlike exercises. They cannot dance, except as <HI>Pirrhus</HI> taught the Epyrots. They love to hunt and chase the Stagg, the Antilope, Gazal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exercises.</NOTE> Tyger, Bore, Goat, Hare, Fox, Jackall, Woolfe, and the like, abounding there. In which pastimes they have singular skill, courage and dexterity; in Bow, Dart, Scemiter, Gun, and Javelin. Their Harquebuz is longer than ours, but thinner and not so good for service. They can use that very well, but detest the trouble of the Cannon, and such field peeces as require car∣riage. They have good Greyhounds not unlike the Irish, apt to encoun∣ter any Lyon. They have Spaniells also but not so good as their Hawkes may challenge. They have many excellent Eyeries of Eagles, Lannars, Goshawkes, and Hobbies: their best Falcons are out of <HI>Russia</HI> and other Scythick Provinces; they fly them at choise game; commonly at Hares, Jackalls, Partrich, Phesant, Herne, Pellican, Poot, Estrich, &amp;c. Their Lures, Jesses, Varvills, &amp; Hoods, are richly set with stones of great price &amp; lustre. The vulgar sort delight in Morice dancing, wrastling, assaulting, bandying, Ram and Cock-fighting; wherein they spend much time: but value not their money to see Boyes dance, or Lavoltoes upon the rope, wherein they are very excellent.</P>
<P>Their Physitians are great admirers of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Physicians.</NOTE> and doat so much there∣upon, that they make that oft-times the first causer which indeed is but in∣strumentall or secundarie: morall men they are, and humane in language and garbe, both which beget esteeme and honor from all that know them: and did not avarice (a vice predominating there, and by occasion of sick∣nesse in me full dearly exemplified) and Magick studies too far sway them, I could value them above the rest; however as they are, they passe for a generation usefull and exquisite. They have degrees transcending one

another in Title, as their skill and Seniority merits. The Doctors are nam'd <HI>Haekeems</HI> (it may be radically from the Hebrew word <HI>Hachajim,</HI> that is, a life-preserver) <HI>Mulaii</HI> in the Arabick. Mountebanks or Im∣posters are nick-nam'd <HI>Shitan-Tabib,</HI> i.e. the Devills Chirurgion. They are Masters of much knowledge and ignore not the Mathematiques. Many Arabick Writers have flourisht in those parts, most of whose Bookes they read and practise by, namely <HI>Galen, Averroys, Hippocrates, Alfarabius, Avy∣cenna, Ben-Isaack, Abu-Ally, Mahummed-Abdilla, Ben-Eladib, Abu-becr, Rhazis, Algazzallys',</HI> and <HI>Albumazar.</HI> In Geography <HI>Abul-foeda</HI> and <HI>Alphra∣ganus,</HI> from whom they better their discourse, and by such Lectures be∣come admirable. Nor want they the knowledge of herbs, drugs, and gums, the Mydan in <HI>Spahawn</HI> abounding in singular variety, and than which, no place in the world can more aptly be termed a Panacaea, a Catholicon, of herbs, of drugs; a Magazein 'gainst all diseases: having also no lesse choice of delicious fruits, rare gums and aromatique odours. This I observed, that to such of us as had fluxes they gave Sloes, Ryce, Cynomon, Pomgranad, Barbaries; to purge melancholy, Alloës, Senna, Rhuparb; for phlegme Turbith; for colds &amp; sweatings, oyles of Beaver, of Leopards, of Jackalls, <HI>herba maris,</HI> our Ladies Rose, &amp;c. Which I note to shew you they have some skill and resembling Europaean prescriptions. Howbeit, sweating in Sudatories is the Epidemic Physick there, most us'd, of least charge and very usefull; insomuch that some Cities have above threescore hummums or baths: some say three hundred. Phlebotomy is but little us'd; not that it is bad, not perhaps because <HI>Galen</HI> and the other old Naturalists ne∣ver us'd it.</P>
<P>They desire rather to tread in an antick path of ignorance, then by any new invention or wholsome study to wrong the judgements of their pre∣dicessors: because forsooth <HI>Eventus varios res nova semper habet.</HI> And hence it is (as I imagine) that they continue their maimed calculations, out of a blind conceit that antiquity commanded them; for they compute their yeares only by the Moone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lame cal∣culations.</NOTE> not by that course and motion of the Sun; affirming, that the firmament or eighth heaven finishes its revolution in two and thirty yeares; which is false: his diurnall motion from East to West compleating it selfe in foure and twentie houres; his other from West to East, but one degree in a hundred yeares; such is the violence of the first mover. Notwithstanding, it may be they meane the heaven of <HI>Saturne</HI> adjoyning it, (whose revolution comes neere their time) finishing its journey from West to East in 30 yeares. And thus, their Lunarie ac∣count is subject to no small errour, reckning from the Autumnall Aequi∣nox 12 Moones, the number of dayes in a whole yeare 353. Our Solar computation exceeding theirs twelve dayes at least, every yeare; where∣by it comes to passe, that 30 of our yeares make 31 of theirs; whence, the difference arises 'twixt us and them in their Aera or Hegyrath, and doubt∣lesse by protract, will cause much more confusion.</P>
<P>Such as practise manufactures, are meanly reputed of; but they live oft-times verie plentifully and more securely from the jealous eye of the King than doe many great ones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inferior sort of Persians.</NOTE> who oft deceive their thoughts that they are happier.

their owne, such is the rapine and pride of the great Begs of the Country; nay, every petrie Cosel-bash dares domineere over them. Yet upon too much abuse the Causee will yeeld them favourable justice.</P>
<P>Generally, the Persians are facetious, harmlesse in discourse, not very inquisitive of exotique alterations, seldome transgressing this demand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disposition.</NOTE> if such and such a Country have good wine, faire women, swift horses, and sharp weapons: choosing rather to fatten themselves by a contented No∣tion, than by curious inquisition to perplex their other recreations. Few of them know how to read, <HI>Bellona</HI> trayning them up in iron dances; but honour such as have it: the Church-men, Clerks, and Santos, attracting them. Some skill they have in Musick; the Dorick and Phrygick, a soft and loftie sort of Consort. But above all, Poetry lulls them, that Genius seeming properly to delight it selfe amongst them. Mimographers I needs must call them, their common Ballads resounding out the acts of <HI>Mars</HI> and his Mistresse, to which two Saints they vow their life and best devotion: <HI>Elgazzuly, Ibnul Farid,</HI> and <HI>Elfargani</HI> first taught it them: and how lame so ere the verses are, their gracefull chanting and quavering (after the French ayre) gives it to the eare, sound and harmonious. And, albeit the men af∣fect not to dance themselves, yet dancing is much esteemed there: the Ganimeds and Layesians (wanton Boyes and Girles) foot it most admirably and in order: I may call them Mymallonian dances; the bells, brasse ar∣molets, silver fetters, and the like recording <HI>Bacchus.</HI> They are in this pra∣ctise so elaborate, that each limb and member seemes to emulate, yea, to contend who may expresse the most taking motion; their hands, eyes, bums, gesticulating severally, swimming round, &amp; cōforming themselves to a Dorique stilnesse, the Ganimeds with incanting voices &amp; extorted bodies simpathizing; nothing but poesie, mirth, wine, &amp; admiration condominating. But were this all, 'twere more excusable; for (though each has his seve∣rall Seralio) these whores seldome goe without their wages: and in a higher degree of perfect basenesse, these Paederasts (by Hellish permission and the Alcurran) affect those painted, antick roab'd Youths or Cata∣mites in a Sodomitic way (not till then compleating the Roman proverb <HI>Persicos odi Puer apparatus;</HI>) a vice so detestable, so damnable, so unnaturall as forces hell to shew its uglinesse before its season.

<P>The honest women never shew their faces, eclipsing (by a large white sheet, the note of innocence and chastnesse, which wholy vailes them) those Beauties which no doubt are not without splendour. No man da∣ring to praise anothers wife; such is their irefull jealousie, and such praise commonly dishonours them.</P>
<P>A word of their circumcision, wedding and burialls: Circumcision is so necessarie, that without it none can call himselfe a Mussulman.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circum∣cision.</NOTE> Both men and women use it; the men for Paradise, the women for honours sake, or <HI>Ben-sidi-Ally</HI> lyes who so paraphrases of it: from nine to fifteen the Fe∣males may; the Males at <HI>Izmaels</HI> age (whom they imagine was <HI>Abrahams</HI> best beloved) are enjoyned it; ere twelve hoping he may be able to speake his Profession.

To work they straightway goe: one holds his knee; a second, disroabs him; a third, holds his hands; others by some triviall conceit strive to win his thoughts, to extenuate his insuing tor∣ment. The Priest (having muttered his orizons) dilates the praepuce and in a trice (with his silver scissers) circumcises him, applies a healing powder of salt, Date-stones, and cotton-wooll; the standers by to joy his initia∣tion into Mawmetry throw downe their <HI>Munera Natalitia,</HI> and salute him by that canonick name of <HI>Mussulman.</HI> If the ceremonie be at home, they then provide a solemne banquet; ere which be done, the Boy enters well attended, is uncloath'd afore them all and circumciz'd; and in comme∣moration of such a benefit (imitating <HI>Abraham</HI> when <HI>Isaac</HI> was weaned) continue a feast three dayes together; at the end whereof, the child is led about in state, bath'd and purg'd from all sorts of sinnes; has a Turbant of white silk put on his head, and all the way as hee returnes is saluted with acclamations. But such an apostat rascall as to swill in luxurie the more, or to roabe himselve with some title or advancement (forgetting that for a base and momentanie applause or pleasure they disroabe their soule of everlasting happinesse, such as runnes paralell with the lines of Eter∣nitie) are brought before the Caddi, who upon his assent leads him into the Mosq' and without much stirre is cut and marked for a Mahomitan (or child of perdition;) which done, that devill incarnate to witnesse his rebellion, spurnes with his accursed feet the Crosse, the hyerogliphick of our salvation: which in the primitive and purest age was of such honour amongst the Christians, as not only they used it in baptisme, but upon their foreheads to despight the Jewes and Heathens, and to glory in that thing the more, they so branded them with as a calumnie. I hate super∣stition in my heart, but that so holy an example should be derided is mi∣serable and to be pittied. To returne; the Renegado in token of more defiance spets thrice at it (making him beleeve, Christ never suffered, but <HI>Iudas</HI> did) and then is to exult in this Battalogue <HI>La la, La-illah, Hyllulla, Allough, aybyr, Mahumed resul-Allough:</HI> God is first, and next him is <HI>Ma∣humet;</HI> he then elates his finger as denying a Trinity, and three Mussul∣men dart three staves three times towards heaven, which ere any touch the ground hee is new-named, then led slowly upon an Asse about the Citie, that every one there may note him for a Denizin, a Beleever and Proselite to <HI>Mahumet.</HI> But (praised be God) I never heard of any Euro∣paean

<P>Their weddings have not much variety to dwell upon; observe there∣fore that Poli-gamie is tolerable; <HI>Mahomet</HI> to excuse his owne infirmity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriages.</NOTE> and borrowing it from the Romans, honours such most as have most wives, and beget most children: to furnish the Emperour with souldiers for defence, Paradize with Saints, and to resound the meritorious praises of great <HI>Mahomet:</HI> the Deruisse an order of begging Frier excepted, who from a transcendent conceit of their owne purity, abhor matrimony, but suppose Sodomy and Natures blackest villanies no sinne, or sins pardona∣ble; producing <HI>Mahomet</HI> their prototype or example, who both by pre∣cept and custome warranted it: but I have tyed your chast eares too long to so impure a subject. Such therefore as dare wed (they need not feare in <HI>Asia,</HI> the women in those parts never predominate) they provide a sum of mony and buy her good-will, her parents being no further charged than to bathe and purifie her. They marry more from report than knowledge, the friends of either party commonly commending, perswading, and ef∣fecting it. The day appointed being come, the Bride is vailed with a fine lawne of callico, her armes and hands are only naked: they mount her bravely, and a great troop of friends and kin accompany her to Church, in the mid-way being met with an equall number of friends, all together agrandizing the ceremonie; after a joynt assent of him and her, they alight and enter the Mosque, where the <HI>Mulay</HI> takes the protest of their good liking; she demanding three things (as did the Jewish women of old,) bed-right, food, and cloathing: their Fathers also speak themselves conten∣ted; the Priest circles them with a sacred cord, conjoynes their hands, takes a reciprocall oath, and calls <HI>Mahomet</HI> to witnesse: the Caddy inrolls their names, the houre, day, month, and yeere of their nuptialls, and with an <HI>Eugè</HI> dismisses them. The first day vapors away in Tobacco, feasts, and other ordinary feastivalls, the men and women being severed: at night, the Bride enters a stove, and is soundly washt and perfum'd, that her degree may the better appeare, and her person be more accepted of: next night they bathe together, and seven dayes after; in which time if hee discover her to be no Virgin, she is return'd to her parents with no small dishonour; otherwise is kept till death part them. The Alcoran allowes incestuous mariages, pretending that thereby true love is better contracted, and lon∣ger conserved in families: in case also the man be weary of her, or that she is barren, he acquaints the Mulay with his distemper, who eases him upon his giving her a dowry; after which, it may be hee will require her againe, and if she agree, are secondly married; yea, five, six, seven times rejecting and revoking, as hate or lust can stimulate: by that disorder, love vanish∣ing, jealousie budding, rage advancing, clamours roaring; and by which, many times the Fathers neither know their own Children, nor they their parents.</P>
<P>Their Burialls revive some ceremonies of old; us'd amongst Jewes and Gentiles: At his farewell to the world, the next of kin closes his eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burialls.</NOTE> as did <HI>Ioseph</HI> in the 46 of <HI>Genesis:</HI> and <HI>Telemachus</HI> in <HI>Ovid, Ille meos ocu∣los comprimat, ille tuos:</HI> they then wash him with cleane water (as was <HI>Tabitha, Acts</HI> 9.) and carrie him to his grave with admirable silence, a gesture

well-becomming Funeralls; they lodge the Carcasse where none lay for∣merly: supposing it a vile part to disturb the dead, whom in the grave they think sensible of torment: they place his head towards <HI>Medyna</HI> and (after the old mode, <HI>septem ad Luctum, septem ad convivium</HI>) for seven dayes, his next of kinne watches to keep the evill Angell from his Tomb; during which, he incessantly warbles out his Elegiac Threnodies, as the last expres∣sion of love he can shew him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other buri∣alls.</NOTE> Others are thus buried: In the first place, go those of his own blood and family, next them his slaves and other do∣mestic varlets naked to their waist, the rest in troozes: who to expresse their zeale the better, burne and scratch their armes and breasts, cutting their flesh, and printing circles, (a trick borrowed from the rebellious Jewes, and prohibited by <HI>Moses.

Next them are ranckt fifty young Gallants, whose shoulders are made to beare some texts taken out of the Alcoran; mixing with them selected Eulogies which they sing and ingeminate. Next these, follow a hundred or two hundred men of note, each holding the cord that drawes the Corps or Hearse: on every side throng the multitude; some bearing in their hands Lawrel or Cypresse boughs, others Coronets of flowers, fruits, or what best befits the season: some semi-naked horsemen play along, and oft times to demonstrate their love, spare not to wound themselves: and in the last place go the <HI>Preficae</HI> or women hyred to weep, to howle, to teare their periwiggs, to smell to onyons <HI>(hinc illae Lacrymae)</HI> and to do such impostures as did the antick Romans noted in <HI>Livy;</HI> and Jewes as <HI>Ieremy</HI> speaks, 9.17. In this Decorum they march slowly, and with great silence: but at his Dormitory ululate <HI>Lala-Hillulla,</HI> there uncloathing, and mundifying the carcasse, his sins there∣by also vanishing: they anoynt him with odours and pretious unguents, and so wrapt in fine linnen they burie him in the earth, and place his head towards <HI>Arabia;</HI> his face looking up to heauen (I note it in regard they put the other sex, their faces downwards,) his armes spread, as prepar'd to imbrace <HI>Mahomet:</HI> above him, they fix two stones, at's head and feet; which in Arabiq' characters ingrav'd and colour'd, denotates his name, quality, religion, and time of buriall: there they leave him, but give not over twice every day to come and sing his Requiem, beseeching <HI>Mahomet</HI> to suc∣cour him against his bad Angells, of whom they nourish this opinion. That so soone as any Mussulman is inhumed, forthwith <HI>Muengar</HI> and <HI>Quarequar</HI> two ougly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Legend of bad Angells.</NOTE> huge, black, and furious Devills do assaile him; the one being arm'd with an iron club, th'other with a hook of flaming brasse: in that terrible sort they view the Carcasse, and in as imperious sort command him to lift up his head, to fall prostrate upon his knees, and beg his soule, till then departed: the dead bodie revives and entertaines his soule again, and faile not both together to accompt their life, and how they have profest <HI>Don Mahomet:</HI> If it appeare his life was morally good, the two Devills ter∣ribly affrighted flie away and give way to two good Angels (apparreled in pure white silke) to comfort him; to the day of doome not budging from him, nor seeming wearie nor unwilling to protect him. But in case his life prov'd bad or repugnant to Mahometry; then without all pit∣ty or respect, the black-fac't Caco-Daemon with the iron club hits him so
<PB N="239" REF="125"/>
pat, so fiercely on the head, as by its fury and force thumps him ten yards deep into the ground: but there hee sleepes not long; for immediatly the other spitefull helhound with the flaming hook pulls him up againe: in that horrid sort tormenting that miserable Mahomitan, till <HI>Mahomet</HI> calls a generall Parliament; where, in one place of his Alcoran hee pro∣mises to save them all, but in another (forgetting his promise it seemes) appoints them all to passe over a narrow Bridge (he calls it the Bridge of judgement) each man carrying his sinnes in a bagg behinde him; but in passing over, such as have heavie loads, the bridge breaks, and they all fall into hell; such as have lesse weight, into purgatory, &amp;c. as I shall di∣sport you with in his Alcoram.</P>
<P>The Persians at this day, when ere they receive a mandat or other letter from the King or wherein his name is used,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reverence to their King.</NOTE> give it no small reve∣rence; they bow their bodies at the receiving it, kisse it in divers places, &amp; then open it: Such is their transcendent opinion of his Majesty, that they repute no lesse of him, than of old times they did of their Elementall Gods; they swear usually by his name, <HI>Sha-ambashy</HI> or <HI>Serry-shaw i.e.</HI> by the Kings head, and is of no lesse force to beget beleife than if they ratified a truth by <HI>Serry-Mortis-Ally, i.e. Mortis Alli's</HI> head, a Prophet than whom they think non greater: or by putting a finger to their eye, and saying chash, the King sees; then (though the story bee never so paradoxicall) if you please, you may beleeve them: yea, in most conceits they parallell <HI>Abbas</HI> with <HI>Mahomet;</HI> in every prayer desiring his content and increase of life, though by the losse of theirs it were augmented:
<Q><L><HI>By losse of ours, the Gods increase your life.</HI></L>
<L>De nostris annis tibi Iupiter augeat annos▪</L></Q>
acknowledging their happinesse from him, and entitling (not without much pride too) their lives, wives, and estates, by him wholly to be dispo∣sed of: they imagine hee knowes their thoughts; and when in his pre∣sence, never speak, cough, spit, or looke upon him, least the fulgor of his aspect might peradventure prove no lesse formidable than the Trisulk of <HI>Iupiter:</HI> they register (now, as of old) his acts and apophthegms, in Cae∣dar Tablets, gum'd with Cynabre, and seldome write his name but in characters of gold, upon paper of excellent glosse and finenesse, varied in∣to azure, vermillion, yellow, and other colours; in a word reputing him the true reptesentator of <HI>Ally</HI> and his glorie, whose perfections they com∣pare to Amber, Nutmegs, Roses, Flowers, and Odours; <HI>Animate Dei Imago in terris,</HI> and (with <HI>Homer</HI>) The best beloved sonne of <HI>Iove.</HI></P>
<P>We were yet abroad; now let me entertaine you in their houses, the cost what ere it be, you shall be welcome to; if it agree not with your ap∣petite I cannot help it, the countrie will afford no better: first satiate your eyes, and note their furniture, and remember that brave man who by <HI>Alcydes</HI> foot found out his monstrous big dimension. A pan, a platter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dyet,</NOTE> and a carpet is the epitomè of all their domestic utensills: their dyet is soone dreft, soone eaten, soone digested, and soone described: their table is the solid ground, cover'd with some sort of carpet, over which they spread pintado cloths; afore each man they lay five or six thin cakes of wheat, or pancakes: every one his spoone also, very memorable woodden spoones;
<PB N="240" REF="126"/>
their handles being well-nigh a yard long, the spoone it selfe so vast, as my mouth could seldome master it, though I gaped extreamly to welcome it: they seldome go beyond Pelo, but in that dish expresse they think a wit∣tie invention, setting before you fortie dishes, call'd by fortie names as Pelo, Chelo, Kishmy-pelo, &amp;c. albeit indeed it differ but thus; all are of ryce, mutton, and hens boyl'd together; some have butter, some have none; some have fruit, some have none; some have turmerack &amp; saffron, some have none; some have onyons and garlick, some have none; some have almonds and raisins, some have none; and so <HI>ad infinitum:</HI> making us also beleeve they make us gallant cheere and great varietie, though the ingredients bee one, diffring only in colour or complement; some comming to the Table as black as a coale, some as white as a curd; others (that you may know their Cooks are wittie) be yellow, greene, blew, red, or as they fan∣cie: and wot you forsooth why Rice is so generally eaten &amp; so valuable? not that it exceeds wheat or other graine in goodnesse, finenesse, round∣nesse or the like; but from a most reverent tradition delivered by their grand Annalist <HI>Iacob-ben-siet-Ally,</HI> a right Cabalist. And this it is? On a time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Legend of Rice.</NOTE> <HI>Mahomet</HI> being earnest in his prayers was accidentally conveighed into Paradize, where being very earnest in beholding its rare varieties, at length hee cast his eyes upon the glorious Throne of the Almighty; and (perceiving the Lord to turne about) fearing he should bee severely whipt for such presumption, blushes for shame, and sweats with terror; but loth to have it seene, wipes off his brow the pretious sweat with his first finger, and threw it out of Paradise: it was not lost, for, forthwith dividing it selfe into six drops, all of them became miraculous creatures: the first drop became a fragrant Rose (therefore is rose-water so much used there, and in honor of the Rose an Annuall feast solemnized:) the second, a grain of Ryce, (a holy graine:) the other foure, foure famous Doctors, who (ha∣ving <HI>Pallas</HI> for their sister) helpt <HI>Mahomet</HI> to compile his holy Alcoran. You have not tasted all yet; sallads, a charrs, and hard egs, parti-coloured; and therefore hard, that their stomack be not too soone emptied: the mut∣ton there is sweet, but fat only in the taile, the weight commonly pon∣derizing above twentie pounds, sometimes the Carcasse: Camell, Goat, and Pheasant are also manducable; the countrie yeelds, the Law allowes it: contrary to Beefe, Veale, Swines-flesh, Hare, &amp; Buffols, prohibited by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> either to collogue with Jewes, or that his owne pallat detested them. Camells flesh they sell commonly in the Buzzars roasted upon scu∣ets or cut in mammocks and carbonadode, three or foure spits valuing two pence. Bad pastery men they are, they put a lamb whole into a kinde of oven, and take it out as black as a cole; they say (I dare not second it) it tasts curiously; it may bee so, but I feare scarce well: well it may bee to a famisht martialist, not so in banquets. The poore are not so voluptuous: they content themselves with drie ryce, herbs, roots, fruit, lentills, and a meat resembling thlummery: Dates also preserved in sirrup commixt with butter-milk, is pretious food and physicall. But, to memorize their Cheese and Butter will make your mouths water at it; I ironize: in good earnest the cheese is the worst any ever tasted of, both that it wants Art and ma∣terialls: tis drie, and blew, and hard; ill to the eye, bad to the taste,
<PB N="241" REF="126"/>
naught for digestion; of an unsaporie taste, rough, and in a month shewes no moysture: the worst is towards the Gulph; the best in <HI>Mozendram;</HI> neither of them praise worthie. Will you taste their butter? first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Butter.</NOTE> inquire how they make it: I enquired of some there, they say they sometimes take what is generated in the Guspans (or sheeps tailes) it saves them chur∣ning: others, boyle the cream soundly in a raw skin'd leather-bag, full of hayres and unsalted: this sort will keep fresh (sweet I say not) six months, in that poynt commendable; but when wee drew our knives thorow it, a thousand sluts haires were then discovered, therein abominable; yet they commend it, we no way condiscended: their liquour may perhaps better delight you; tis faire water, sugar, rose-water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drink.</NOTE> and juyce of Le∣mons mixt, call'd Sherbets or Zerbet, wholsome and potable: they drink wine (coloured like a pale Claret,) <HI>Arac</HI> or <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> Tobacco, (suckt through water (that it inebriate not) by long canes or pipes issuing from a round vessell,) and above all the rest, Coho or Copha: by Turk and Arab calld Caphe and Cahua: a drink imitating that in the Stigian lake, black, thick, and better; destrain'd from Bunchy, Bunnu, or Bay berries; whol∣some they say, if hot, for it expells melancholy, purges choler, begets mirth, and an excellent concoction; but not so much regarded for those good properties, as from a Romance that it was invented &amp; brew'd by <HI>Ga∣briel</HI> (what <HI>Gab.</HI> we despute not of) to restore the decayed radical moysture of kind hearted <HI>Mahomet;</HI> who (as he speaks himselfe to his inimitable glo∣ry) never drunk it, but immediatly by vertue thereof made it a matter of nothing to unhorse forty men, and in <HI>Venus</HI> Camp (with more than a Herculean fortitude) to bring under forty women. <HI>Opium</HI> (the juyce of Poppie) is of epidemick use there also, good if taken moderatly; bad, nay mortall if beyond measure; they chaw it much, it helps catarrhs, cowardise, and the epilepsie; strengthens <HI>Venus,</HI> and which is admirable, the Foot-posts by continuall chawing it, runne sleeping day and night in a constant dreame or giddinesse, seeing, but not knowing whom they meet, though well acquainted, and misse not their intended places; by a strange efficacie expulsing the tedious thoughts of travell, and rarely de∣ceiving the poore body of its seasonable rest and lodging. I have devi∣ated, this was discourse at dinner, not yet ended.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meales.</NOTE> They commonly eat in earth or porceline, not valuing silver (the King by such an Article of of their Faith, the neatlier attracting it to his own Table;) they have an∣other reason (very ridiculous,) that <HI>Mahomet</HI> at his stealing into hell disco∣vered the Devills at dinner, and served in silver; earthen ware was holier, and therefore better for all kind of Mussulmen. In feeding they use not knives, nor count they it luckie to imploy but one finger or two; three or foure is injoyned them from tradition. Nor do they cut their bread but break or rend it: equally fictitious; the storie lying thus; that <HI>Ozman</HI> in his parody assures them, The Devil (<HI>Shitan</HI> they call him) ever diets so: a palinody they might sing, knew they how <HI>Ozman</HI> borrow'd it from the Jewes, who ever us'd to break their bread; and from <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in his description of the Persians: but they owe all to miracle, deriding Historie.</P>
<P>At meales they are the merriest men that may be: no people in the world have better stomacks, drinke more, or more affect voracity: yet
<PB N="242" REF="127"/>
are harmlesly merry; a mixture of meat, and drink, and mirth, excellently becomming them:
<Q>Qui canit arte canit, qui bibit arte bibat:</Q>
and then are joviall in a high degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Complement</NOTE> when women (Curtezans I meane, custome anticipates the honest sort) accompany them. They admire their breeding (to us they seemed barbarous;) especially when in an exact com∣plement, out of squallid wantonnesse they would overcharge their wide mouthes with pelo or other meat, and by an affected laughter take occasion to exonerate their chaps, and throw the overplus into the dish againe whence first they had it; and as a symbol of intire good will (sir reverence) offer you, to eat what they had chewed formerly: to make an end, having soak't their hussinees or water baggs, the wine bottles are then emptied; they sit long and drink soundly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drink.</NOTE> condemning that precept in the Alcoran as an idle toy, a lie invented by <HI>Osman</HI> That it is Giants blood, yea, of those we call <HI>Theomachi,</HI> or who fought against the Gods; the Turks forbeare to drink it from that prohibition: the Persians laugh them to scorne, and by this have brought them to a favourable opinion of grapes and wine. But the Persians in this are commendable; they never quarell in their cups, yet such usually irritates: nor compell they any to sit longer than hee please (arising without any excuse,) nor drink they one unto another; a prejudicat conceit tis in any man to think all brains alike in such more than beastly exercises; a base custome, too much abus'd in this Age of corrup∣tion; forgetting that <HI>Minos</HI> an old Heathen strictly forbad it the Cre∣tans, as <HI>Plato</HI> warrants in his Dialogues. But these, compar'd with those of old are without resemblance. These are homely, those full of excesse and braverie. <HI>Dyon</HI> and <HI>Ctesias</HI> assure us that in old times the Persian Mo∣narchs made many feasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feasts.</NOTE> &amp; usually invited fifteen thousand men; in every entertainment expending foure hundred Talents, amounting in our mo∣ney to two hundred and forty thousand crownes: at private feasts when forty or fifty were received and no more (as <HI>Ephipius Olynthius</HI> records,) each supper stood him in a hundred Mynaes of gold, each mina or dina, in our money valuing six and twenty shillings and eight pence: pretty in that juvenility of time (for we say <HI>plures opes nunc sunt, &amp;c</HI>) yet credible when we consider the vast revenue of the Persian Empire in those dayes extract∣ing Tribute from many Nations; For, what accrued out of those twentie Provinces, was not lesse than forty thousand and five hundred Attique or Euboick Talents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crowne re∣venue.</NOTE> in our summes forty hundred thousand crowns or there abouts: therfore might they easily lavish out such prodigious expences. Out of <HI>Indya</HI> also they yearely received three hundred and threescore Talents of gold. The crowne revenue at this day is little lesse, (albeit the juris∣diction royall be not halfe so spatious) and amounts to mighty summes: <HI>Ta∣hamas Anno Dom.</HI> 1560 received eight millions of crownes, gathered from fifty Sultans who farm'd his in-comes; besides an annuall present or tribute of 20000 crownes <HI>Leventhibeg</HI> a <HI>Georgian</HI> Prince, never fail'd to send him: and 12000 horse the Curdyes 'twixt the two Seas also eased him of pay∣ment: and <HI>Abbas</HI> at this day from silk, tribute, and exactions, receives yeare∣ly above nine millions: foureteene millions and 280000 florins some say, 357000 Tomans in Persian money, in ours 1190000 pound sterlin: And
<PB N="243" REF="127"/>
though the ground (by a continued flaming of the Sun) be barren in grasse, trees, or the like, yet it hinders not that her womb is rich and uberous: for besides her store of rarest marble, the earth from her concave bosome, oft-times discovers many rich mineralls and stones of lustre, Jacynths, Jasper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Myneralls.</NOTE> Chrysolites, Onix, Turquoises, Serpentine, and Granats: the Pezars and Pearles (than which no part of the whole world has better) also no lesse valuable. Of old, the Persian hills have been famoused for Mynes of gold. <HI>Plautus</HI> in <HI>Sticho</HI> remembers it,

<L><HI>Which (if the proverb lie not) are of gold.</HI></L>

But whether they have any now or no I know not. Thus having done with this of old; record we the coynes at this day used:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coynes.</NOTE> the Abbassee is in our money sixteene pence; Larree ten pence; Mamoodee eight pence; Shahee foure pence; Saddee two pence; Bistee two pence; double Coz∣beg one penny; single Cozbeg one halfe penny; Fluces are ten to a Coz∣beg: the gold coynes are Sultanyes, Duraes, &amp;c. but few seene; all but the Cozbegs and Fluces being pure silver, the other brasse, and currant all o're his Monarchy.</P>
<P>I have else-where described the buildings in <HI>Persia:</HI> a word of their beds and other customes, Their beds are generally, Cotts of two foot height,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beds.</NOTE> or foure posts strengthened with girthweb; a shagg or yopangee atop; of double use, serving as an Vmbrella abroad, at home a Coverlet: in Sum∣mer their Slaves attend about them; some to waft and to beget coole ayre, others to scare away the Gnats and such like buzzing vermin.</P>
<P>The men account it no small shame to urine standing, but call such dogs rather than Mussulmen; we beleeve them: they mundifie their genitors after it, and to that end have Slaves every where attending them with Ewers of silver to cleanse pollution: they hate to see men walk: such they think mad; a madder thing to see them ride tho not a stones-cast journey.</P>
<P>Their horses are of the Arabian breed, bodied like Jennets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horses.</NOTE> but farre more swift and couragious: they curb their fierie mettall with sharp cut∣ting bitts, a ring of iron also helping them; their bridles are long and stud∣ded with gold: of such mettall are their pummells and stirrops; their saddles are usually of velvet; high &amp; close, like the Morocco sort: the trees are curiously painted: those they borrow from the Tartar, are hard, and small, and close; sure, but not so easie. They are generally fat and in good liking, albeit their fare be meane and slender; a little bagg fill'd with bar∣ley and chopt straw hung about their heads, is both livery and manger; they strictly tie them to a proportion, more or lesse breeding death or dis∣eases. The Mules are no lesse valuable; of better service where the passage is sandy, desart or mountanous. Men use Horses and Asses to ride upon;

women never, but upon Camells; every Camell loaded with two Cages (or Cajuaes as they call them) holds two women; of wood, coverd with scarlet commonly, low, and not suffering them to stand upright, but lesse grievous in that for most part all sorts sit, &amp; cannot endure long standing: when any mans Haram travels, they are guarded with leane-fac't Eunuchs without weapons to offend women, but arm'd with bowes &amp; swords to de∣fend thē against any bold or curious opposer: upon sight of any of them, all travellers fly out of the way, albeit they be the best men in <HI>Persia;</HI> to make good the custom, and to prevent such mischiefe as jealousie drawes too oft along with it, enflaming there as quickly as in any other part of <HI>Asia:</HI> where we will finish our domestick view; and turne our eyes upon other objects: their Language first; next, their Religion; and (as a farewell) end all in a compendium of her Emperors.</P>

<HEAD>The Religion of the Persians.</HEAD>
<P>THE Persian Religion at this day varies not from the Turks in any particle of the Alcoran; and yet they account one the other He∣reticks, and are no lesse zealous and divided in their profession, than wee and the Papalins: a devision begun <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1400, by a Syet of <HI>Ar∣doveil</HI> (a Citie in <HI>Media;</HI>) the better to advance the Sophyan Title to the Crowne, derived from <HI>Mortis Ally</HI> their famous predecessor, cosen and sonne in law to <HI>Mahumet:</HI> which <HI>Ally,</HI> albeit hee had just right to sit as Kalyph at <HI>Mecca</HI> next to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> yet in his despight, three other men stept up before him; and during their lives kept him in slaverie, and with∣stood him. These three, <HI>Abuboker, Omer,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ozman,</HI> are by the Turks most venerably accounted of; but by the Persians (as appeares by their cursing them in a prayer made by <HI>Syet Gunet</HI>) as impostors, doggs, and hereticks; whereby is sown such mortall hatred betwixt these two potent Monarchs that (to Europs good) they abominate each other with implacable hatred.</P>
<P>MAHOMET, (sonne of <HI>Abdar</HI> a Pagan, and <HI>Emma</HI> a Jew) was borne at <HI>Iathreb</HI> (or <HI>Itrarip, Iezrab</HI> in <HI>Postellus,</HI> now <HI>Medyna</HI>) in <HI>Arabia,</HI> the yeere from the Creation 4544, of Christ our blessed Lord and Saviour 574: <HI>Iu∣stinian</HI> at that time commanding the Roman Empire, and <HI>Cozrhoes</HI> (father to <HI>Hormizda</HI>) the Persians.</P>
<P>His parents being mean and poore, he was forced to serve an appren∣tiship, and with much patience served <HI>Zayed-ben-Hartah</HI> a rich and famous Merchant; who dying, left his servant so good a legacie, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was thought worthy any woman in <HI>Mecca:</HI> but by reason of those inces∣sant broyles commenc't by <HI>Cozrhoe</HI> and inflamed by the Romans, Traffick decayed, and most men danc't to the shrill brazen sound of <HI>Bellonaes</HI> mu∣sick; <HI>Mahomet</HI> amongst the rest serving for pay first with <HI>Heraclius,</HI> and then the Persian; not caring much who was victor, so he was on the safest side, by both their confusion to plot some way or other to advance himselfe, both in a terrhen dignity and as a Deity: nor did he erre in his prediction; for what by his great estate and good fortune in the warres, he soone threw off the qualitie of a common man, and got a companie; yea at length an Armie of so many Tattars and Arabians, that he dared to assault the infeebled Christians, and became victor; yea, by stratagem (mingling with the credulous and gladded Persians) upon a watch-word cut asunder and confounded the Persian Armie. Which done, hee blusht not to extoll himselfe to all his troops, deciphering the misery of <HI>Persia</HI> and horror of <HI>Roman</HI> bondage; acquainting them also with the great dis∣cord 'mongst Christians; of that inhumane villanie perpetrated upon <HI>Mau∣ritius</HI> by <HI>Phocas</HI> (then Emperour) his detested servant, and of Pope <HI>Boni∣face's</HI> usurpation of the title of Universall Bishop; contrary to the good will of all the World, and what Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the great had lately bran∣ded <HI>Iohn</HI> the Constantinopolitan Patriack with, as the Antichrist; in that sixtie six good Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>Lynus</HI> (seven yeeres after the passi∣on) to that Pope then teaching, never desired it. That hee himselfe was
<PB N="252" REF="132"/>
ordained from the begining of the world to eclipse the pride of that Pope, to instruct the world in a better and more plausible way than either <HI>Moses</HI> did the Jewes, or <HI>Christ</HI> the Christians; that hee was the Comforter pro∣mised (yet sayes that he came to give his Law by the sword and not by mi∣racles) and to advance the Arabians name and dignitie above all other Kingdomes in the Universe. The amazed Savages admire his boldnesse, and (though some thought basely of him) most part hoping hee could ef∣fect his promises, give credit to him and atttend his revelations.</P>
<P>But ere he could finish his new moulded work, the inraged Persian sud∣denly steales among them and in memory of their late kindnesse, retaliates them so fiercely, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> (to save his life) posts away, leaving the rest to the mercilesse furie of the Persian.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> with a sad heart arrives safely in <HI>Mecca</HI> (<HI>Mocura</HI> and <HI>Muny∣chiates</HI> in old writers, the Arabian Metropolis:) but when he cals to mind his miserable estate, by this last defeat being cheated of his moneys and men, yea such men as hee had prepar'd to help forwards his ambition, hee consumes in the meditation, and by his faint-heartednesse and constant vexing had doubtlesse made Death his executioner, had not Satan physicke him.</P>
<P>Some safer way he intends to take, than in <HI>Mars</HI> his rugged fields, so full of cost and blood-shed. And therefore in the first place, to solace his un∣quiet spirits &amp; inrich himselfe, he laies seige to <HI>Chodaige</HI> or <HI>Aediga</HI> a woman of great wealth and worship, by some thought Queene of <HI>Corasan;</HI> whom after a few amorous assaults he won, and of her begot three sonnes and foure daughters, named <HI>Ebrahim, Tajeb,</HI> and <HI>Taher</HI> (all three dying young) <HI>Fatyma</HI> and <HI>Zaynab</HI> (both married to <HI>Mortis Ally;</HI>) <HI>Om-Kalthom</HI> and <HI>Rachya,</HI> wives to old <HI>Abuboker. Mahomets</HI> stomack grew weak, and one sort of meat begun to loath him, <HI>Chodaige</HI> was stale, and others fancied him: he therefore purpos'd in his Law (then in hatching) to allow all sorts of car∣nall liberty: and to incourage them by his example, solemnly (as <HI>Ben Ca∣sen</HI> a writer of his beleife sayes) espoused <HI>Aysce</HI> the beloved child of his sonne in law <HI>Abubocher:</HI> a child (though <HI>Mahomets</HI> wife) I well may call her, at that time not exceeding six yeeres old; yet so pliable to the de∣lights of her wanton husband, that hee calls her his best beloved, and dictates a whole chapter to her praises; so that for her affection to him, her courtesie to others, her witty conceits, her skil in history and language, she is intituled Mother of the Faithfull; and (contrarie to his tenet in his Alcoran) in whose grave (hoping there also to imbrace her) <HI>Mahomet</HI> desired to be buried, as was by old <HI>Abubocher</HI> afterwards performed</P>
<P>His third wife was <HI>Miriam</HI> (or <HI>Mamrya</HI>) of whom he begot <HI>Ebrahim Cas∣sen,</HI> who at the age of six months, by the arrow of grim death was directed the inevitable way of his brethren. <HI>Zaynab</HI> (the repudiate of <HI>Ben-Har∣tah Mahomets</HI> master) was <HI>Mahomets</HI> fourth and last wife (concubines hee had above a hundred, but in any Author I find not named) a Lady of singular perfection, and so credulous of his feigned visions (and that his epilepsie was caus'd by an Angells glory, oft conferring with him) that by all Mahomitans she is also named a second Mother of Mussulmen or true beleevers.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="132"/>These his bosome friends, and other his bed fellowes, together which taught birds to feed at his eare, and beasts by practize directed, blazond his holinesse, and put all <HI>Arabia</HI> into a confused wonder: and having by the Devills prompting, and the help of <HI>Sergius</HI> an Italian (a neast of un∣cleannesse, a Monck, a Sabellian, a discontented wretch for missing world∣ly preferment at <HI>Byzanth,</HI>) and of <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Antioch</HI> (an infamous Nesto∣rian) finisht his Alcoran in the yeere of our blessed Lord God 620. and of <HI>Mahomets</HI> age 46. which so transported him, that to <HI>Mecca</HI> hee goes, intending to divulge it, and where hee hoped to have it easily credited; but therin his prediction faild him, for so soon as they perceived his ground of innovation (formerly acquainted with his birth, breeding, and subtle∣ty they banish him, and but for his wives kindred had crusht him and his Cockatrice egge, but then in hatching. <HI>Mahomet</HI> (involud with more per∣plexity now than ever) is at his wits end, once resolving to burne his book and fall to trading: but <HI>Sergius</HI> moderates, telling him, a designe of so great consequence must needs bee attended with persecution and many other circumstances. The halfe dead Prophet revives upon this incou∣ragement, and quickly apprehends this affliction propitious to his me∣mory; so that to <HI>Iathreb</HI> hee goes, and for two yeeres secludes himselfe from much company; till having finisht his plot, and commanding the ac∣compt of all his sectaries to begin from his late flight out of <HI>Mecca,</HI> he again adventures, and by bribery, magick, and other meanes attracted ma∣ny followers, and in seven yeeres after is received in <HI>Mecca:</HI> from this accursed root branching out so many sects as in short time infected and shaded all the Orient, in an eclipse of fearfull darknesse.</P>

<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> (whose name Arabically signifies Deceit, and many times <HI>Conveniunt rebus nomina saepe fuis;</HI> affoording also the number 666 the marke of Antichrist,) having accomplisht his desires, and runne his race, is summond to appeare before the Lord of all flesh, the God Omnipo∣tent, Omniscient, and Judge of all mens actions; where (no doubt) he re∣ceived a just judgement for his impiety. This was in his great clymacteric 63, of the <HI>Hegira</HI> 17, and of our Saviour 637, ordaining <HI>Ally</HI> to succeed him, and his Carcasse to be placed in <HI>Aisces</HI> grave in <HI>Iathrip</HI> which <HI>per Antono∣masiam</HI> he new named <HI>Medina Talnabi;</HI> it or <HI>Mecca,</HI> in my opinion, being that <HI>Munichyates</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> but I rather think <HI>Mecca</HI> it, because I read that <HI>Medina</HI> (or <HI>Iathrep</HI>) was built <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 364. by <HI>Aadhuddaule</HI> then King of <HI>Babylon:</HI> and by <HI>Osman</HI> allegorically call'd <HI>El-haramain,</HI> and by others <HI>De-A'salem</HI> i.e. a holy place or Town of mercy, none daring in the garb or language of a soldyer tread East, West, North, or South, nigher than six one way, twelve, eighteene, and twenty foure miles the other; upon paine of death and eternall displeasure. Speak we now a little of his fabulous Alcoran, or <HI>Sunna,</HI> i.e. the Book of truth, or a Legend for the faithfull: stuft with obsceannesse, lyes, miracles, visions, morall and natu∣rall Philosophy; such trash as may powerfully provoke the silliest student to a height of laughter. The proem this; That it was sent from God by <HI>Gabryel</HI> the holy Angell to <HI>Mortis Ally;</HI> but hee mistaking the man, gave it to <HI>Mahomet;</HI> whom when God saw replenisht with equall vertue, the Angell was not blamed, but the guift confirmed and made irrevocable.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="133"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Alco∣ran.</NOTE>To begin then; The Alcoran or Bible (by them call'd <HI>Kurrawn</HI> and <HI>Alesalem</HI> i.e. the law of peace, or Alcacan i.e. Judgement, as it was digested by <HI>Ozman</HI> fifteen yeeres after the death of <HI>Mahomet</HI>) is in volume twice so big as the Psalmes of <HI>David;</HI> divided into a hundred and foureteene Azoaraes or Chapters, put by <HI>Ozman</HI> into a poore kind of rythme, unplea∣sant to the eare, unlesse well ordered: It is not a continued tract of de∣votion or direction, but of his owne life, the Art of warre, the use of peace, Rhetorick, Numbers, the Zodiack, the Earth, and a mishmash out of <HI>Applis</HI> (or <HI>Aristotle</HI>) grosly and confusedly handled. His mother instructed him in the Jewish Rites or Talmud: and <HI>Sergius</HI> in the Gospell: where∣by, in the seventy one Azoara of <HI>Nohha,</HI> and in the tenth of <HI>Iunys,</HI> hee re∣cords the Historie of <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Ionas;</HI> and in other chapters, of <HI>Enoch, Abraham, Ioseph, Moses, Elias,</HI> and <HI>David;</HI> whose songs call'd <HI>Zebur-Dahood</HI> or the Psalmes of <HI>David,</HI> and the <HI>Teurat Moissah</HI> or <HI>pentateuch</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> he extolls most vehemently. The <HI>Ingil</HI> also (or Gospell of Saint <HI>Luke</HI>) he sets out at large in the fourth Azoara of <HI>Anneza,</HI> and in the fifth of <HI>Al∣meyda,</HI> naming Christ, the Messiah, <HI>Rooth-noor Alloh,</HI> and <HI>Hazret, i.e.</HI> Mes∣sias, the Spirit or word and light of God, holy Jesus: not omitting his bo∣dily ascention into heaven in sight of his twelve Apostles, seventy Disci∣ples, and five hundred men. Yet denyes him be to the sonne of God, but that the Virgin conceiv'd by smelling to a Rose presented her by <HI>Gabriel;</HI> and that he was borne out of her breasts. Also that he was not crucified, but <HI>Iudas</HI> or some other wicked theife; Christ being separated from them by a cloud that covered him and came from heaven. And thence it is, the Crosse is so rediculous amongst them; they say also that hee was the most holy, chast, and powerfull Saint that ever converst on earth: and that (in the second Azoara of <HI>Albacara</HI> in the Alcoran) <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> shall save the Jewes and Christians at the day of Doome: and yet in the next chap∣ter of <HI>Amram</HI> (forgetting what hee had said) protests that no soule shall ever bee saved but by his Alcoran, hee being sent into the world to mode∣rate the strictnesse of the Gospell, as Christ did the severity of the Law ce∣remoniall; varying also from what in the twelfth Assuratto hee com∣mands, that they should bee held in equall repute with the Alcoran; run∣ning thus: The holy and mercifull God, first sentt he ceremoniall Law, and then the Gospell to direct all men in the right path, and lastly the Al∣coran, a faithfull Book, and for your instruction. No man therefore that is truly religious, dare to undervalue the old Law and: Gospell, but to practize it no lesse than what is commanded in the Alcoran. From whence it is, that they reverence the holy Sepulchre, visit Saints Tombs, and ho∣nour the memorie of our Saviour; abhorring the Jewes of all creatures. Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> Baptist also hee speaks modestly of, and of the blessed Virgin with singular reverence: saying in the nineteenth Azoara to this purpose, Hayle <HI>Mary,</HI> thou art blessed, yea in puritie and holinesse excelling all other women; the meditation of Gods lawes was ever in thy heart, therfore he hath selected thee, refined thee, and made thee his happiest dwel∣ling; thou art full of knowledge and mercie; free from pollution, hatred or ambition: yea, thou the Virgin Mother of the great Prophet Jesus, art only of woman-kind most lovely and perfect in the sight of the Al∣mighty,

&amp;c. Which I name, not that his Book is any way more valuable, (the end considered, which was his plot for Apostasie) but that the Devill and <HI>Sergius</HI> who helpt him, could not blaspheame, nor bee suffered to de∣rogate from their Majesty; and to whom we say in the words of our Savi∣our to the Demoniack, hold thy peace; and <HI>ex ore tuo laus sordet.</HI> The residue of the Book consists of Heresiarchyes against our blessed Saviour; with <HI>Arrius</HI> it denies the Divinity; with <HI>Sabellius</HI> the Trinity; with <HI>Macedonius</HI> the holy Ghost proceeding; with <HI>Manicheus</HI> the death of Christ; and such like errours as to them and Satan seemed plausible. In the 32 Azoara, hee commands that no man be so impious to question any particle of his Law, nor to dispute about it; and yet in another chapter confesses that tis full of lyes.</P>

<P N="2">2 Comman. <HI>'Tis neither good nor just that any Mussulman live unmar∣ried; lest the professors of the Alcoran</HI> (<HI>or</HI> Mahomet) <HI>be thereby diminished.</HI></P>
<P>Whence it arises that <HI>Poligamy</HI> is tolerated; yea, that such are thought the most honourable and brave men who super-abound in wives and con∣cubines. The chast Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> in the Azoara of <HI>Bacara</HI> boasts much of his owne delight and singularity therein; and that he had strength at most times to satiate the lust of forty women. In that chapter of <HI>Attahrim</HI> he also confesses that he oft had violated his faith and troth; but, it grie∣ved him not, in that hee had received pardon from God; and had to wit∣nesse it, his good friends <HI>Rachel</HI> and <HI>Gabryel,</HI> two holy Angels.</P>
<P>But who sees not, that in this precept of his (like a polite Machiavillian) he had respect to the naturall disposition of the Arabians, pleas'd with free∣dome and voluptuousnesse, rather than to any vertue: not caring how, so by any magick he could yoak them to obedience, and affectation of his Alcoran.</P>
<P N="3">3 Comman. <HI>It behooves all Mussulmen to bee charitable; and to hate contention.</HI></P>
<P>From this command, issues most good to Travellers; for whereas Innes are not to be had in heathen countries, stately buildings (call'd <HI>Imarets</HI> in <HI>Turkie; Carravans-raws</HI> in <HI>Persia; Serrays</HI> in <HI>Indya</HI>) are purposedly built and open for all commers, never questioning their Country, businesse, nor religion; the roomes are sweet and well kept, the stables be convenient; and not any is to pay ought, in that twas founded from the charity of some Mahomitans; who have beene knowne to spend in one of those common receptories fifteene thousand pound sterling: such are in <HI>Shyraz, Cashan, &amp;c.</HI> they also erect Hospitalls for lame men and diseased: yea, for aged, starved, or hurt birds, beasts, and such like creatures.</P>

<P>Which, they carefully accomplish; and with such regard that when the Muyezin is heard to cry aloud from the Mosque they fall to prayer, though then busied in prophane talk, drinking, drabbing, or the like. And in praying, to help their memorie use Beads, stop their eares, and shut their eyes, lest any thing might divert them in their zealous Orizons; which they actuate in a quiet and silent murmur, bending, prostrating, and kissing the ground or some relique of holy earth brought from <HI>Medina,</HI> the Haram or Alcaba, two holy Chappels in <HI>Mecca,</HI> erected (sayes the Alco∣ran) by <HI>Abraham</HI> from the true Idea of that which <HI>Adam</HI> built in Paradize; albeit some hold that he stayed there not above a day, &amp; carried by Angels into heaven at the generall Deluge: in every <HI>El-fata</HI> or prayer sizedaing or kissing the earth at each Epethite or name of God and <HI>Mahomet:</HI> and after they have battologuiz'd Ilalay-lala, they iterate another to this ef∣fect following.</P>

<P>And though this be the most usuall, yet they are not without other set formes of prayer, compiled by <HI>Osman</HI> in his Parody, (for, in the 17 Azoara <HI>Mahomet</HI> confesses that he could neither read nor write) and by that famous <HI>Almotannabby,</HI> who fell in his learned conceits to make his Name more venerable than <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Their Elfataes are either for the safety of their Kings, a happy issue, the welfare of their Country, thanks that they are Mussulmen, Bosarmen, or true beleevers, and the like: five times in foure and twenty houres praying (or rather balbutiating) orderly. The houres are, day-breake, noone, three in the afternoone, sunne-set, and at mid∣night: recorded by these titles.<HI>Ashaera, Magreb, Adelesher, Kalamath,</HI> and <HI>Erketh;</HI> Arabically thus, <HI>Dahour, Lashour, Mogrub, Sallit &amp; Sabaha L'hair.</HI> The first houre, is acted by foure Tessalems or prostrations and two pray∣ers; 2. by ten times kissing the earth and five El-fataes; 3. houre requires eight grovelings, and foure ejaculations; 4. has five Sizedaes and three orations; and the last houre for a farwell has fifteen tesselems and eight re∣petitions: after that houre to day breake tis held an ungodly thing to in∣vocate. The Persians since their reformation, think it enough to pray thrice in foure and twenty houres; at <HI>sob, dor, &amp; magareb</HI> Arabick words, and which signifie morning, noonee, and night.

<P N="5">5. Command. <HI>See thou observe yeerely a Month Lent, a Byram, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Lent or <HI>Ramdam</HI> (call'd also <HI>Ramadan, Ramazan,</HI> and <HI>Ramulan</HI>) be∣gins commonly at the Sunnes entrance into <HI>Aries, Libra</HI> other times, no time certaine; and is an imitation of our Lent, or rather the forty dayes <HI>Moses</HI> was in <HI>Horeb,</HI> and by some said in memory of <HI>Mahomets</HI> forty dayes hiding himselfe in the Desart, flying from the rage of <HI>Mecca's</HI> Inhabitants, and that in that moneth he divulg'd the Alcoran: but most likely (as in the 47 <HI>Azora</HI> of himselfe, and 25, in which he treats of the excellencie of the Alfurcan) from his blasphemous lie that he was so long in the sixt heaven call'd <HI>Alahal,</HI> where this Anthropomorphite sayes hee had the honour to shake hands with the Almighty (which he sayes were 70 times colder than Ice;) and that being upon th'earth, to make the people credit him, he com∣manded the Moone to descend; halfe of which he put into his own sleeve, and the other halfe serv'd as a zone or girdle to <HI>Mortis Ally:</HI> and to their like amazement, after so rare a complement peec't it, and placed it in the same Orbe whence first he drew it.</P>
<P>During this Ramdam, all the day long they abstaine from all sorts of vi∣ands or refection, he being counted the veriest heretique in the world dare ryot it. But, <HI>Don Phoebus</HI> is no sooner inveloped with his dark mantle the earths interposition, and Dame <HI>Cynthia</HI> arrayed with brightnesse in their Hemisphere, then they gormundize and let loose the reines of their un∣bridled appetite, Epicurising in all kindes of delights to be invented, or pleasures possible: <HI>Prosper's</HI> saying, That to fast from sinne, is the best fast; is here ridiculous. So soone as the nine and twentieth day is past (for though the Alcoran command forty, yet by those of the late reformation, it was limited to one Moone) they begin the Byram (as we doe Easter) and continue their merriment and sports till the third day be ended; the two dayes after the Byram, are commonly call'd <HI>Chutsi-baaram,</HI> &amp; <HI>Char-bahram</HI> (or <HI>Byram.</HI>) The last houre of the last festivall many vow a zealous pil∣grimage to their Prophets Sepulchre (not magnetically attracted, nor in∣tombed in an iron coffin as some report, but laid under a faire marble, po∣lisht and ingraved with Arabique sentences out of the Elesalem.) But in the way, wallow in all kind of swinish turpitude, villany, and lothsomnesse; yet no where persecuted, being palliated with a Pilgrims coat and hypo∣critique sanctity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buccarie</HI> they solemnize in November or <HI>Chodad-maw</HI> (by Turks <HI>Silcade,</HI> by <HI>Arabs Rabiel owl</HI>) in commemoration of the Ram sacrificed by <HI>Abraham</HI> such time as <HI>Izmael</HI> (they say) should have beene killed.</P>
<P>Many other Festivalls they celebrate. The <HI>Oud Hussan, Nowrouz, Imamy, Caddyer-Ally, Iedt-Ousant, Auwpatsian;</HI> the <HI>Sophyan,</HI> the <HI>Roses, Daffadil∣lies, &amp;c.</HI></P>

they thought to have extirpt <HI>Ally's</HI> root, yet by divine providence S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Az∣mully</HI> brancht secretly, <HI>Anno Hegirae</HI> 90. and from him this Siet of <HI>Ardoveil,</HI> reviver of the Sophian dignitie. For the Syet not onely sleighted the Turkish opinion of <HI>Mahomets</HI> three successours <HI>Abubocher</HI> and the rest, but cursed all such as honor them; yea, and foure other great Hodgees or Doctors of the Alcoran, contemporarie friends and helpers of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> those foure (if I be not deceiv'd) whom <HI>Mahomet</HI> (in a feare for his pre∣sumption beholding God in Paradize) wip't from the sweat of his brow, and by divine myracle metamorphiz'd into foure learned men, thus named, <HI>Achmet Sembelim, Abu-hamet, Melec-zeddah,</HI> and <HI>Sheck Vaffaim:</HI> a tenet so offensive and exasperating to the Turks, that of late the Muphti condem∣ning an innocent Persian, swore a great oath, he thought it a better act and a more meritorious sacrifice to kill one Persian, than seventy Christians. But to our Storie.</P>
<P>All agree that <HI>Hussan</HI> was slaine trecherously by <HI>Chuse</HI> a slave to <HI>Mnavi. Mavi</HI> was an Actor, they therefore punish him yearely (though rotten 1000 yeares since.) First, framing a deformed Image, his face blackt, his nose pierc't with a Dart, and clad in straw: which done, they hurrie it through the streets in a hurly-burly of thousands of people, who when they have dragd it enough within the City, hale it to some rising hill with∣out, wher to all mens view they elevate this (supposed living) Caytiffe. The Caddy bawles out a pathetique Oration to this purpose, That after much search, <HI>Ally</HI> had directed them where to apprehend this Traytor, unwor∣thy the least pittie or procrastination: this being that same villaine who slew <HI>Hussan</HI> and his sons (<HI>Ceresin</HI> only escaping:) that every good man is bound in conscience to curse him, yea to help to torment him in the vilest manner possible.</P>
<P>In shew of joy and assent they unanimously sing <HI>Epicinia</HI> (a song of victo∣rie and crie aloud, <HI>Yough Ally,</HI> yea strive to rend the clouds with their ceaselesse clamours. At a set time they cease roring, and fire is given to a trayne of Gunpowder which sets divers squibs a fire, and at length dissi∣pates and blowes up the detested Syrian, by a hideous noise making the ayre eccho at his smokie Funerall. <HI>Hussans</HI> ghost now sleepes quietly; each Persian commends one anothers zeal; haste home, &amp; spend that night in merriment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nowrouz</HI> is in imitation of our New-yeares day; but they begin (af∣ter the old manner) in March, such time as Phoebus in his equall shine to either Pole, makes the Aequinoctium. A festivall of jovialitie, for one pray∣er preying upon varietie of wanton pleasures; the Talismanni piping now to <HI>Bacchus, Ceres,</HI> and Madam <HI>Venus.</HI> For, I have observ'd, that in manie parts for 11 months in the yeare we could see verie few women, and those vailed; but impossible in the streets or gardens to converse with anie with∣out danger: yet these twelve dayes of the Nowrouz all places were full of them, yea their naked faces openly discovered; frisking in amorous po∣stures, and drawing the eye by a forced Magique. Gifts also and recipro∣call presents are retorted up &amp; down; with garments of silk &amp; gold, horses, fruits, and piscashes of other sorts; nothing but riding the great horse, drinking, cock-fighting, fortune-telling, singing, courting, and the like
<PB N="261" REF="135"/>
observed to the last minute of that Festivall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Imamy</HI> has some dependance on the <HI>Buckaree.</HI> This a Camell, that a Ram; that for <HI>Ismael,</HI> this for <HI>Mahomet.</HI> In November, the Meccan Protomist sends a sanctified Camell by an adopted sonne (sometimes natu∣rall) who is welcom'd to <HI>Spahawn</HI> by many thousand Mussulmen, who shew th'extream of joy for so holy a Present. After they have tried &amp; tired their voices, the Hodgee from an exalted place acquaints them with the cause of his long journey, perswades them to a thankfull remembrance, and blesses them. The zealous multitude without anie respect of men or danger, throng about the Beast, who is no sooner in the field where Death arrests him, but that they fall upon him, and pluck off his haires with an ad∣mirable dexteritie, keeping them as sanctimonious reliques, praevalent against sudden death (though manie die in the assault, and thousands re∣turne maymed) hunger, thirst, povertie, and the like. After which, the tormented Camell is by the Hodgee againe signed for a sacrifice. The Darroguode, first transfixes his Javelin. The Visier beheads him, and gives it the King. The carkasse is torne peece-meale by the foole-hardie mul∣titude; so greedie to obtaine this charme of long life and plentie, that im∣mortalitie and the place where meat and drinke is needlesse, oft praeci∣pitates them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caddier Ally</HI> is for <HI>Ally's</HI> victorie over the three old Caytiffs of <HI>Mecca</HI> by death (not <HI>Ally</HI>) conquered; and his joy in heaven: which after some threnodies many prayers are muttered, songs chanted, and almes be∣stowed: the King being at most charge, the greatest honor reflecting him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iedt Ousant</HI> is from a Cabala, that <HI>Housant</HI> was lost in a terrible great wildernesse, where thirst killed him. Nine dayes they wander up and downe (shaving all that while neither head, nor beard, nor seeming joy∣full) incessantly crying out <HI>Hussan Hussan</HI> in a melancholy note, so long so fiercely, that many can neither howle longer, nor for a moneths space re∣cover their voyces.</P>
<P>The tenth day they find an imaginarie <HI>Hussan,</HI> that <HI>Nunquem{que} satis quae∣situs Adonis,</HI> whom they eccho forth in Stentorian clamors, till they bring him to his grave; where they let him sleepe quietly till the next yeares zeale fetch him out (<HI>Semper enim perdunt semper &amp; inveniunt</HI>) and force him againe to concomitate their merry devotion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Auwptpatsion</HI> (or Owdt-baptsion) is from <HI>Mahomets</HI> baptisme by cursed <HI>Sergius:</HI> and seemes to deride our customes, to make their circum∣cision lovelier. A rascall troop of circumcis'd Mahomitans assemble, and (after the Darroguod has put a period to his rustick Oration) promiscu∣ously besprinkle one anothers faces, then soile their flesh with durt and filth, the great ones many times to please the King acting among them; Lastly, they cleanse themselves with purer water, supposing all contami∣nated deformitie washt off, and their bodies wholsomer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sophian,</HI> is a solemnitie of fasting, feasting, and praying for the pro∣speritie of their King, of the Sophian pedegree.</P>
<P>The feast of <HI>Roses</HI> and <HI>Daffadillies</HI> is begun by a Procession of holy men, at the first budding of those sweet flowers, and for thirtie dayes is ce∣lebrated with all manner of sports, and recreations to be imagined; conti∣nued

<P>The Alcorar is a miscellany of other prodigious things. It tracts in the 33, that <HI>Dagial</HI> or <HI>Shytan,</HI> i. e. the Devill, shall be saved by <HI>Mahomet:</HI> &amp; in the 72 Azoara, that all Elgehenni or infernall ghosts shall after I know not how many yeares bee freed. The other Azoaraes of his <HI>Kurrawn</HI> are of Arithmetick, fights, dangers, truth, falshood, tyranny, warre, peace, pro∣phesie, &amp;c. The 85 Azoara treats of the Zodiac; the 90 of the Sunne; the 91, 92, 93, of the Moon, of night, of morn; the 113, of the Firmament; but is Philosophy of such coursenesse that I may well say, <HI>Discum potius quam Philosophum:</HI> for how can it well be otherwise, since in his 17 Azoara, hee confesses that hee could neither read nor write; but that all his learning was super-naturall. In one chapter hee is bold to say, that <HI>Solomon</HI> was a great Magician, and that hee learnt it from <HI>Marot</HI> and <HI>Arot,</HI> two great black Devills: with more reason we may say, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was skild in that infernall wisdome, if halfe of those miracles bee true hee re∣cords of himselfe; one is this: In a great assembly of Arabian Pagans, he pointed at the Moone with his thumb and long finger; it seemes it knew his mind, for the Moone immediatly clove asunder, and in two peeces fell upon the hill of <HI>Mecca,</HI> on which hee at that time stood: <HI>Mahomet</HI> with a peece of his linsey-wolsey coat patcht it and made it whole againe; and after it had also (say the Persians) circumvolved <HI>Mortis Ally</HI> in way of imbrace or complement, it re-ascended, and from that day became the badge or coat armour of all Bosarmen. In another, hee assures his Pro∣selites, that <HI>Mecca, Medina,</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem</HI> be holy Cities, built by <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradize, but fram'd in heaven: &amp; thence it is, that <HI>Ierusalem</HI> is by Turks as well as Christians, honoured: foure Cities sprung out of hell at the birth of <HI>Mahomet</HI> (at which, time all Idolls fell, and <HI>Lucifer</HI> was throwne into hell, so deep into that abisse, as hee was some yeeres ere he could get up againe) the names of those devillish Townes are (as pleases <HI>Mahomet</HI> to say) <HI>Elmedin</HI> in <HI>Caldea, Antioch</HI> in <HI>Syria, Vastat</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and <HI>Eh-beram</HI> in <HI>Armenia:</HI> Places, it seemes which had refused him and his learned Do∣ctrine.</P>
<P>But lend your eares a while and listen to the most serious subject of his Alcoran. In the 47 Azoara, he records hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pilgrimage into the highest heavens; where he saw rare things, and thence brought a certain descrip∣tion of the severall Spheares, Heavens, Hells, and Paradises: as also of
<PB N="263" REF="136"/>
Angells, and Saints; of judgement, the resurrection, joy and paine, &amp;c. of which I will afford you a compendium for Mussulmen to beleeve, for us to laugh at. One eve (as <HI>Mahomet</HI> was sporting privatly in's chamber at <HI>Mecca,</HI> with <HI>Aysce</HI> his young wife) <HI>Gabryel</HI> (<HI>Seraphyel</HI> the Persians call him, the same that fosterd <HI>Mahomet</HI> and <HI>Ally</HI> three yeares, and was perad∣venture such a <HI>Malus Genius</HI> as haunted <HI>Brutus</HI>) in a flash of fire entred their bed-chamber, and saluted <HI>Mahomet</HI> with this message: Haile thou beloved man! I come to fetch thee: the God whom thou so zealously worshippest, desires to see thee at his owne station. <HI>Mahomet</HI> rejoyces, and going to mount upon the Angells wings (of which hee had seventy p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire) is hindred: he asks which way he should take towards heaven, the Angel shewes him a huge Asse, <HI>Albarack</HI> by name, and bids him mount upon him; which <HI>Mahomet</HI> essaying could not doe, till hee had prayed for him. From <HI>Mecca</HI> hee posted (in the twinckling of an eye, for <HI>Barack</HI> at foure steps had done it) to <HI>Hierusalem:</HI> there, the Angell dismounted him, and took him into his owne protection. In few minutes <HI>Mahomet</HI> ascended heaven, and was let in by <HI>Gabryel</HI> the Porter there. From one heaven to another is a travell of five hundred yeares; howbeit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heaven</NOTE> <HI>Mahomet</HI> glanc't through the seven in a moment. In all which Orbs hee saw many strange things; but first take notice what mettall the Orbs are made of. The first is of refined silver, and wherein all the glittering starres are fixt with chains of burnisht brasse: in this heaven he saw a Cock so great that stand∣ing upon the Moon, his cox-comb reacht into the imperiall heaven, many millions of miles altitude: every time that this Cock crowed, all other Chanticlears upon earth, re-ecchoed him. The second heaven is of gold, such gold as has beene seven times tried in the fire. The third is of pearle; in this heaven hee saw innumerable troops of Saints and Angells; each of them saluted him by his name, and he prayed for them. Amongst the rest he took notice of <HI>Adam, Enoch, Abraham, Samuel, David, Salomon,</HI> &amp;c. all whom he knew by revelation; and of which, some he taxed, others hee commended as occasion served him. The fourth heaven, is of Smaragd, and where he saw infinite companies of other Angells who made a mighty noise and incessantly praised God: and well they might make a noise, for (sayes <HI>Mahomet</HI>) every Angell there, was a thousand times bigger than the globe of the earth; and each had ten thousand heads; every head, three∣score and ten thousand tongues; and every tongue praised God in seven hundred thousand severall languages: amongst them, he noted one espe∣cially, <HI>Phatyr,</HI> or the Angell of Mercie; a creature of that vast frame that every step he trod was twelve times more than the distance is twixt both the Poles. <HI>Mahomet</HI> inquired of him why he wept so fiercely; the Angell replied, that it was out of his compassion to see the deplorable estate and vanity of man. This is that same Angell that has the Holy Quill or pen in keeping; a pen of orient Pearle; so long, that an excellent Arabian Cour∣ser in five hundred yeeres continuall galloping, can hardly reach to the further end of it: with this pen, God registers all things past, present, and to come; the Inck he writes with, is pure Light; the Character so miste∣rious, that none but he and <HI>Seraphael</HI> can understand it. All the hundred and foure holy Books are written by this Quill; <HI>viz.</HI> those ten which <HI>Adam</HI>
<PB N="264" REF="137"/>
received; <HI>Seth</HI> had fifty; <HI>Edris</HI> (or <HI>Enoch</HI>) thirty; and <HI>Abraham</HI> had the rest: it also writ <HI>Moses</HI> his Law, <HI>Davids</HI> Psalmes; Christs Gospell, and <HI>Ma∣homets</HI> Alcoran. The fifth heaven was of Diamonds: where hee saw a mighty Angell, and of all others the wisest: hee had as many heads and tongues and voyces as any two others had in the inferior Orbe; and had the keeping of that Book, wherein all men in the world have their names written: he did nothing but turne over the leaves and blot out one name or another, for by that (as by the arrow of death) they died suddenly. The sixth was of Turquoisse; the Seventh of Alahal; (some interpret it fire; others, pure light or breath congealed.) All these circumvove one another like Pearles or Onyous; but herein is the miracle, they be trans∣lucent and yet of mettalls: a rare Philosophy! above all, is the heaven of heavens, full of light and silence: immense, and within which, all other bodies are comprised, but it incomprehended: there <HI>Mahomet</HI> saw the throne of God, rich beyond expression: very great also, for it was supported by seven Angells, each of them so wonderfully great, that a Faulcon if he were to flie a thousand yeeres incessant flight, could scarce go so far, as is the distance of one eye from another: about the Throne hung foureteene candles, everlastingly burning: the length of every of those candles (as <HI>Mahomet</HI> measured) was from one end to another as much space as a good horse can ride in five hundred yeeres: there hee saw the Almighty, who bad him welcome, and laid his hand upon <HI>Mahomets</HI> face: his hands (sayes this blasphemous deluder) were a thousand times colder than Ice: for all which, <HI>Mahomet</HI> in shame of his owne basenesse, blusht for shame, and swet with feare; but with his long finger hee swept away the sweat from his brow, and threw it into Paradise: rare sweat! Each drop (he notes them to be six) turn'd into some rare thing or other: one drop into a Rose, another into a graine of Rice; the other foure into foure learned men, <HI>Ac'met, Sembelin, Abuhamed, Melec-zed,</HI> and <HI>Seh-vaffin;</HI> After hee had sufficiently instructed himselfe in many mysteries, and was assured of Gods favour, he descended with his Alcoran: but how he got it enter∣tained, how notoriously it has blasted the earth and poysoned most parts and Iles of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africk;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Angells.</NOTE> it requires another place, to have it spoken: here only let us note the mad conceits he fancies of Angells, the last judg∣ment, Paradize, hell, &amp;c. Angells are either good or bad; both are sub∣ject to death: the good, because they consist of flame, an Element; to sin, because <HI>Lucifer</HI> an Angell, by ambition was expulst Paradise. The bad An∣gells are imprisoned in Doggs, Swyne, Toades, Wolves, Beares, Tigres, &amp;. After the day of Doom they shall be tormented in hell some millions of yeers; but must in the end by vertue of <HI>Mahomets</HI> law be delivered.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Day of Doome.</NOTE>The great and generall Judgement is as certaine as the day of Death, and will happen suddenly, such time as all the world is wrapt in a carelesse security: the Angells know not the time, till <HI>Mahomet</HI> point it out by a great and fearfull Duell twixt death and him, whom in the end hee makes to fly away; but by that combat becomes so inraged, that he destroyes all living creatures in the world suddenly; for new arming himselfe in flam∣ing brasse, in each quarter of the world hee sounds his dreadfull Trumpet, whose affrighting clangor not only makes men, beasts, fishies, birds, and
<PB N="265" REF="137"/>
like creatures dy, but the Angells also give over living; and lastly, <HI>Adriel</HI> himselfe, whom God commanded to follow the rest in the inevi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le path, by wrapping his iron wings about him, and strangling himselfe with such a dreadfull noyse, as is scarce imaginable.</P>
<P>After this ensues a terrible and universall Earth-quake, followed by a violent shower of purling brimstone, which must devoure all grasse, trees, and vegitable Creatures; yea the Pallaces of the proudest Tyrants: and turne topsi-turvie, the earth, water, and other elements into a confused lump. Forty dayes it must rest in a disordered Chaos; in which time, Almighty God shall grasp it in his fist, and (beholding it) say to this effect. Where are now the haughty Princes, the cruell Tyrants, lacivious wan∣tons, and greedy earth-wormes of the earth? which said; he will for for∣ty dayes and nights space incessantly raine downe a gentle shower of mer∣cy, and by a gratious breath reduce the world into a most glorious estate: after that, hee will call up <HI>Seraphyel,</HI> and bid him take his Trumpet in his hand: the Trumpet is of purest gold, and above five hundred yeeres tra∣vell from one end to another: at the first sound will ensue a revivification of Angells and Men: at the second, the Angells re-assume their glorious roabs, and men their naked flesh againe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudgement.</NOTE> <HI>Michael</HI> the Arch-Angell (per∣ceiving the Tribunall rais'd upon a high mount in <HI>Iehosaphats</HI> vale) he ap∣proaches with his mighty ballance, and poyses every man their good and bad deeds in either cale: such whose good deeds out ballance their evill actions, are put upon the right hand, the other on the left: after that, they are loaden with their sinnes packt up in a satchell and hung about their necks; in this sort they passe (upon a narrow and weak Bridge) over Hell; such as have few sinnes get oversafely; those that be heavie laden breake the Bridge and fall into hell: at the otherside stands <HI>Mahomet</HI> in the shape of a Ram, and in his deepe and monstrous fleece lodges all his Sectaries, whom after long travell he brings to some gap or other he finds in Para∣dise; and skiping in, disburthens himselfe, and shakes them out; at that in∣stant assuming new formes, more lovely, more strong, and every way more excellent; with eyes as big as the whole earth, and with eye-browes big∣ger and more beautifull than the Rain-bow. Let the Alcoran tell you what Hell is, and what is Paradise. Hell is in the Umbelic or navell of the world; circled with a huge thick wall of attractive Adamant:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hell.</NOTE> tis entred by 7 gates of flaming brasse; divided into many severall cells or dungeons: some are more loathsome and fuller of torment than others be; and lodge such soules as have more highly sinned: some caves bee so deep that in a thousand yeeres, a milstone cannot find the bottom of it; in whose descent are sharp swords and pikes placed purposely to cut and torture the soules that move there: some places be abisse or without any bottome; so full of oyle and brimstone that it is ever flaming, and so terrible, that the De∣vills howle, and scritch, and rage there beyond measure: other prisons be full of Toads, Serpents, and all noysome and horrid creatures imagi∣nable: the damned eat nothing there save the forbidden fruit; which being in their guts inflames like sulphur, and makes them roare for anger. Some rivers be full of Crocodiles: others so cold as makes them gnash &amp; chatter: howbeit, these paines of hell must not abide for ever, for after each soule

has suffered so many thousand of yeares as the sinnes amount unto they have committed, <HI>Mahomet</HI> will deliver them (and the Devills also;) first changing their affrighting shapes into shapes more tollerable, &amp; then bring∣ing them to <HI>Alcanzar,</HI> (a streame flowing out of Paradise) they must coole their extreame heat, and wash away their black-scorcht mummies, and varie into a moist flesh, whiter than the driven snow, and thence-forth sing <HI>Lala hillullaes</HI> unto <HI>Mahomet.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Paradise.</NOTE> Paradise is a place of as much delight, as <HI>Mahomets</HI> carnall rapture was able to imagine: he is incertaine of the locall place (it seemes hee forgot to aske Gabryell) but supposes it shall be upon the earth after the day of Doome is past, and all deformity removed: (till then the soules and bodies of men sleep in their graves, but sensible of joy and torment.) Paradise (sayes the Alcoran) is so many miles about as there be moats or atoms in the Sunne: It is inclosed with a wall of nine∣ty times refined gold; ten thousand miles high, and in thicknesse about three thousand: It has also seven gates to enter in at (seven is a mysterie;) of Carbuncle or purest Rubie is the first gate; the other six be of Pearle, of Emrald, of Turquoyse, of Hiacinth, of Smarag'd, and of Amarist; some∣what reflecting upon the spheares. It is divided into seven spacious Gar∣dens, and those are sub-divided into seventy times seven severall places of delight; each of them fill'd with Inhabitants, Musick, Wines, and all sensuall pleasures possible: all have coole refreshing rivolets of Chrystall, and trilling over pibbles of sweetest Amber: curious Summer-houses it al∣so has, shaded with trees, ever fruitfull and verdant: in center of that plea∣sant fancie, is a tree (a high and spreading tree) higher than all the moun∣taines of the world, were they heapt one upon another; and so broad that all Paradise is shaded by it; the trunck or bole of this rare plant is of Dia∣mond; the leaves be of Ophyrian gold; the boughes of jet: each leafe is wraught into an antick shape, very delightfull; and most admirable in this; on one side is growing in letters of light, the name of God; on the other side the name of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Foure streames gush out of it, in severall quartets; they be of purest water, of milk, of coho, of honey; and empty themselves into <HI>Alchansar,</HI> whence this mixture of <HI>Nepenthé</HI> flowes into other parts of Paradise: there are also Aromatick flowers, such as ravish both eye and smell; birds also or aëry Quiristers; the meanest of which as far excell our Nightingalls, as they the Ravens: the ayre is a compound of sense-ravishing odours: the Mahometans (Christians, Jewes, nor Gentiles, have not such glory) are ever young and lustfull, a hundred times bigger and more frolick than ere was <HI>Mahomet:</HI> The women are severed from the men; not that they are kept from them (for <HI>Gabriell</HI> never away to let them in) but that by such restraint they may become more transcen∣dently delightfull the women have such visages as <HI>Aisce</HI> had (<HI>Mahomets</HI> best beloved;) their haires be threds of gold, their eyes of Diamonds as big as the Moone: their lips of cherries, their teeth of pearle, their toagues of rubyes: their cheekes of corrall, their noses of Jasper, their foreheads of saphyre: round-fac't, sweet, amorous, and mercifull: In this Paradise there is a Table of Diamond, seven hundred thousand dayes journey long; along which, are chayres of gold and pearle to feast upon.

To end; <HI>Gabryel</HI> the porter of Paradise has seventy thousand keyes which pertaine to his office; every key is seven thousand miles long; by which you may imagine the doores are no pigmie ones: in a word, had not <HI>Mahomet</HI> Confest hee had writ three parts of foure, false lyes in this his Legend; we would have concluded him, Notorious.

But let none think that Syetts was the first Schisme amongst them: for <HI>Ozman</HI> being dead, <HI>Ibnul</HI> adds more Commentaries to infeeble <HI>Ozmans:</HI> and after him, one <HI>Ibnu Abel-hasen</HI> of <HI>Balsora An. H.</HI> 88. a notable subtil man; for by his austere life and eloquence, he not only nullified the Melchian credit, but <HI>Ibnul</HI> also in comparison of him was counted sottish: At his death they Sainted him: but trusting to tradition (for they could never prevaile with <HI>Hassen</HI> eternize himselfe by writing) his Disciples differ in many doctrines; so farre, that blowes made a party of times in case of dif∣ference: not could they agree in any point, till <HI>Elharu-Ibnu-esed</HI> of <HI>Baby∣lon</HI> did his best in many comments to reconcile them, and make cano∣nicall <HI>Elhesin's</HI> Paragraphs.

About this time the Roman Monarchy in the West took end. <HI>Chozrhoe</HI> of all the Tyrants of <HI>Persia</HI> was most wicked and desperate: hee first concluded peace for 110 yeeres with <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Roman Emperour; but quickly broke it, and to the utmost of his power inraged them: 'twould bee end∣lesse to speak his restlesse motion, his barbarisme, his hypocrisy.

He consumed the great and stately Temple dedicated to St. <HI>Michael</HI> the Arch-Angell: and accompted it no sacriledge to rob other Churches: hee besieged <HI>Sergiropolis,</HI> but is forced thence dishonourably: he attempts the spoile of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> but hearing that <HI>Bellisarius</HI> (in his time the most rich and wretchedly poore of men) was approaching, hee renues his league with the Romans: but purposes not long to keepe it; for next yeere hee forrages <HI>Armenia,</HI> and <HI>Phoenicia.

Nos auream Crucem lapill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distinctam ad ejus Templum missuros, &amp;c. una cum Cruce quam Instinian Imp. ad Templum ejus misit, &amp; quam Cosrhoes Rex Regum, &amp;c. filius Cabadi nostri proavi, &amp;c. advehit, &amp;c. ad Aedem Sancti Sirgii mittendum curavimus, &amp;c.</HI> as you may find at large memorized by <HI>Baronius.</HI> A Dish of gold also he dedicated with this inscription, <HI>Ego Cos∣roes Rex Regum, &amp;c. haec in Disco inscribenda curavimus, non ut spectentur ab hominibus &amp;c.</HI> Nay, he went further in his hypocrisie: hee gave out to indeare the Christians (his owne hated him) that he affected to be a Chri∣stian: but how politique so ere he was, his Queene <HI>Cesarca</HI> found him a dissembler. Shee (good Lady) to espouse Christ, fled to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and there received baptisme most joyfully: <HI>Cosrhoes</HI> followed her with 60000 men, and when he saw she was not to be recovered without he would be∣come a Christian, he also was baptized and all such as followed him; to the amazement of the Asiatique world: as P. <HI>Diaconus</HI> has it in his 4 <HI>lib.</HI> 16 <HI>ch.</HI> In <HI>Victor</HI> also and in <HI>Iohn</HI> Abbot of <HI>Biclar,</HI> as is extant in his Epistle in these words, <HI>In his ergo temporibus quibus Deus omnipotens prostrato ve∣ternosae heresis veneno, pacem suae restituit Ecclesiae, Imp. Persarum Christi fi∣dem suscipiens, &amp;c.</HI> But of speak of his Apostasie, his crueltie against the Christians, and other barbarismes he afterwards perpetrated, would rather require a volume than to be confin'd to so small a narration as I intend to all of them. For so soone as he heard of the massacre of <HI>Mauritius,</HI> his wife and children, by <HI>Phocas</HI> a Captaine in his Armie; and of the arrogance of <HI>Boniface</HI> the Romish Bishop, who at that time assumed the title of univer∣sall Bishop, he rejects <HI>Lilius</HI> the Roman Ambass. &amp; Apostatises; yea vowes to sacrifice himselfe in <HI>Mauritius</HI> his quarell, or be revenged on that villa∣nous <HI>Phocas:</HI> and thence-forward he revives his Pagan titles; in all his let∣ters and proclamations beginning thus, <HI>Cosrhoes King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Ruler of princes, Salvation of men,</HI> &amp;c. By such his blasphemie he hoped to assure his owne he was once more a Pagan. <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 603 with an Armie of 100000 men he entred <HI>Syria;</HI> there, in <HI>Palestine</HI> and <HI>Phenicia</HI> doing all the mischiefe imaginable. All the lesser <HI>Asia</HI> parched in his inflamed furie: hee harried the poore Christians as farre as <HI>Chalcedon:</HI> takes <HI>Capessa</HI> and <HI>Edyssa. Anno Dom.</HI> 612 hee heares of the untimely deaths of <HI>Narses</HI> and <HI>Phocas</HI> his enemies, beheaded by <HI>Heraclius</HI> the Emperour. That yeare
<PB N="277" REF="143"/>
also he sackt <HI>Apamea, Cesaria, Cappadocia, &amp;c.</HI> but at <HI>Antioch</HI> is overjoyed with a victorie he obtain'd against the Christians: This encouraged him to over-runne <HI>Palestyne, Ierusalem</HI> also, where hee derided <HI>Zacharius</HI> the Pa∣triarch and transferd the Crosse thence to <HI>Shyraz</HI> in <HI>Persia:</HI> hee subdued <HI>Aegipt</HI> also, <HI>Alexandriae,</HI> and <HI>Lybia;</HI> and made the blackt fac't Aethiopians admire his frenzie. The Roman Empire had reason to be affrighted, when they felt his wrath in <HI>Anatolia,</HI> chiefly in <HI>Ancyra</HI> the Galatian Metropolis. 'Tis reported that in that out-breaking he slew 300000 Christians; agran∣diz'd by the Jewes who followed him, and payd readie money for many Christians, whom without mercie they slaughtered. <HI>Heraclius</HI> sent 70 Roman Gentlemen to mediate Peace; <HI>Saes</HI> the Persian Generall threa∣tens them as spies, and barbarously beat them back againe. <HI>Heraclius</HI> is so impatient at that high indignitie, as with a good number of men he fought with <HI>Saes</HI> and gets the victorie: <HI>Saes</HI> for his payment is by <HI>Cosrhoes</HI> com∣mand flayed alive, and <HI>Sarbaeras</HI> made Generall. <HI>Heraclius</HI> Winterd in the Pontique Regions, <HI>Sarbaras</HI> with a monstrous Armie passes through <HI>Cili∣cia,</HI> and one Moone-shine night assayled the Romans whom he thought to have found unprepared: but by that haste lost 50000 of his men, and gave a brave encouragement to the Christians. <HI>Cosrhoe</HI> next yeare sent <HI>Sarna∣bassa</HI> to trie his fortunes.</P>
<P><HI>Heraclius</HI> requires a truce, but <HI>Cosrhoes</HI> vowes revenge, and never to rest vexing the Christians. And to that end sends <HI>Sathyn</HI> into <HI>Trepizond,</HI> but at <HI>Azotus, Heraeclius</HI> affronted him, and had the victorie. At <HI>Gazacot, Cozrhoes</HI> dares the Roman Emperour with an Armie of 50000 Persians: never was battell better fought nor more doubtfully; but at length the Persians flie away, yea <HI>Cosrhoes</HI> upon a swift Arabian Courser posts to <HI>Theobatman,</HI> hoping there if any where to finde safetie. But such was the generall hate he had plunged himselfe into, that he distrusts that Santua∣rie. <HI>Heraclius</HI> resolves to ferrit him, but <HI>Cosrhoes</HI> hearing of his approach, thinks it more safe to flie away than looke for help from that helplesse Deity. <HI>Heraclius</HI> when he had throughly searched that idolatrous place and could not find him, is sorrie; but rejoyces againe that his Deastri were there to execute his wrath on. The people, some he slew, the rest he ba∣nished: the Flamens he sacrificed to their Idoll, the Pyree he incinerated, and made other common fire be commixt with that they boasted they had from heaven, and together made it consume the whole Citie into ashes: at <HI>Gazacot</HI> also hee did the like where was another Pyree infinitly resorted to by those Idolaters. An abomination taught them by <HI>Zertoost</HI> in King <HI>Gustasps</HI> time, and seemes to mee either that which <HI>Moses</HI> forbad the Israelites, that they should not let their seed (or children) passe through the fire to <HI>Moloch</HI> (which some think was a brazen hollow heated Statua) or as the Sepharuites practis'd, of whom 'tis said, that they burnt their chil∣dren in the fire to <HI>Adrammeleck</HI> and <HI>Anammelec,</HI> the Gods of <HI>Sephervaim,</HI> as is in <HI>Levit.</HI> 18.21. and in the 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 17.17. and 31. and concerning which Idolatry we read in <HI>Lucian, Strabo lib.</HI> 15. <HI>Procopius lib.</HI> 2. <HI>de bello Persico, Aga∣thias lib.</HI> 2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst other things which <HI>Heraclius</HI> found there in that Temple de∣dicated to the Sun, was one Deaster or image of <HI>Cosrhoes,</HI> which the people
<PB N="278" REF="144"/>
worshipped: the frame was round, resembling heaven; his head was wreathed with the Sun; the rayes spread themselves to the umbelique or navell of the image: on one side was the Sun againe depicted, on th'other the Moone and Starres, his brother and sisters; and under his feet, the An∣gels with Crownes and Scepters, attending him: bat albeit the work was rare and the materiall of refined gold; yet did the good Emperour throw, it into the fire to incorporate it with his Diety. <HI>Cosrhoes</HI> by this had ga∣thered a fresh Armie out of <HI>Hyrcarnia,</HI> and bids <HI>Shae-Rablecca</HI> to forrage <HI>Al∣bania:</HI> but they stood so excellently upon their defence that <HI>Rablacca</HI> re∣turnes till <HI>Sarbaras</HI> with new forces forc't him back; and much hurt questi∣onlesse had they done had not <HI>Heraclius</HI> speedily entred and rooted them both in one day, yet neither knowing it. <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Prophet was in <HI>He∣racliu's</HI> Armie till now: and about this time begins the Hegyra or flight of that false Prophet from <HI>Mecca,</HI> whose people threatned to kill him for his innovation and doctrine. <HI>Anna Dom.</HI> 622 and of the Emperours reigne 13, <HI>Sarbaras</HI> past his Armie over <HI>Euphrates</HI> of purpose to trie the fortune of warre with <HI>Heraclius:</HI> who so soone as hee knew his intent gave him rea∣son to repent his arrogance: the good Emperour himselfe discharging his duty so excellently &amp; with such excellent courage, that <HI>Sarbaras</HI> upon view of it cryed out thus to <HI>Cosma</HI> his Companion, O <HI>Cosmal</HI> seest thou with what courage the Emperour fights? certainly hee alone is able to vanquish all our multitudes. That Winter the Emperour marched to <HI>Sebastia,</HI> and crossing the river <HI>Halys</HI> made <HI>Paphlagonia</HI> his rendezvous. But <HI>Cosrhoe</HI> swels with passion, and combines with Lucifer, that by diabolicall Witchcraft he might vex the miserable Christians, against whom hee raged with all sorts of cruelty: and ere he gave a farewell to this world, once more ventures a battell with the Romans: 150000 men he musters up, and divides them in three; to <HI>Sayn</HI> one part, to <HI>Serbaras</HI> another, to himselfe the rest: ima∣gining by some or all of these to doe wonders. <HI>Sayn</HI> with his 50000 went against the Emperour. <HI>Sarbaras</HI> with his 50000 marcht to <HI>Constantinople:</HI> and <HI>Cosrhoe</HI> stayes upon the frontiers. <HI>Heraclius</HI> divides his also into three; the one to hasten into <HI>Thrace,</HI> the other to bestow a Camisado upon <HI>Sayns</HI> Quarter, the last hee led himselfe into the Lazic Territories: to which place the Gazarrs (a sort of Turk) came to serve him: <HI>Theodore</HI> in small time rais'd <HI>Sayns</HI> Armie, his Chrysolocae; assisted by hayle from heaven, so direfully thundring on them, that all men there, saw that God fought for them. <HI>Sayn</HI> was a slaine in that battell; but in stead of a decent buriall, the Persian Tyrant array'd his carcasse in raggs, persumed him with dogs turds, and slasht his sencesse trunck into a thousand peeces. That yeare the Gazarrs (to gratifie <HI>Heraclius</HI>) under conduct of <HI>Ziebit</HI> broke through the Caspian straits, and did the Persians much mischiefe, and to the Roman Armie exprest no small affection. <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 626 <HI>Sarbaras</HI> with infinit troopes entred <HI>Thrace,</HI> pillg'd <HI>Calcedon,</HI> a towne built by <HI>Iason</HI> and <HI>Ar∣gias,</HI> much traded to, in view of <HI>Bysanth</HI> and upon the <HI>Bospherus.</HI> After that, they layd siege to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and for ten dayes, incessantly laboured to enter it: but such was the excellent courage of the Christians, such her naturall defence, that the Persians could not prevaile; but upon notice that <HI>Heraclius</HI> was approching, they rais'd their siege &amp; retreated shamfully.
<PB N="279" REF="144"/>
<HI>Anno</HI> 628. the Roman Emperour entred <HI>Armenia,</HI> and in a long fought battell obtained a mervailous great victorie. After which, hee demolisht <HI>Ctesiphon,</HI> and pursued <HI>Cosrhoe:</HI> who when he heard that <HI>Sarbaras</HI> had sped but ill in <HI>Thrace,</HI> and had re-delivered <HI>Caloedon</HI> to the Christians, inflamed with passion he sends a villain an Assassinate to murther him: but by strange hap the Emperors sonne had notice of it and acquaints the Generall; who by this ingratitude of <HI>Cosrhoe</HI> begun to raise a dangerous rebellion. <HI>Cos∣rhoes</HI> when he saw things succeeded thus infortunatly, in anguish of soule breath'd out his spirit: a Fever first, and then a Flux so taking him, that after he had reigned 50 yeares, upon his death-bed he nominated, as King his sonne <HI>Mardesae</HI> begot of <HI>Syra</HI> his Queene; who ere hee could set the Crowne on's head, was slaine by <HI>Syroes</HI> his brother, yea before his fathers face: an act so horryd that <HI>Cosrhoe</HI> bitterly curses him; but <HI>Syroes</HI> (the most bloudie viper that ever liv'd) heaps greater sinnes upon his head, by commanding some villains to shoot him to death: at that instant his loathed soule call'd to mind his like cruelty to <HI>Hormisda</HI> his father, and acknow∣ledged that God was just to his retaliation.</P>
<P>So soone as <HI>Heraclius</HI> heard of <HI>Cosrhoes</HI> death, he imagines all his quar∣rells ended: that yeare therefore he travell'd to the holy Citie, and pre∣sented <HI>Zacharyas</HI> the then Patriarch with the Crosse of Christ, found by Saint <HI>Helena</HI> (a Brittanish Lady) 3 May 326. and ravisht thence by <HI>Cosrhoes</HI> as I lately remembered. His triumphant entring thither was the 17 of Sep∣tember 628: the same yeare that <HI>Boniface</HI> published to the world his Ca∣tholique Supremacie; and in which, <HI>Mahomet</HI> divulg'd his Alcoran.</P>
<P><HI>Syroes</HI> (by <HI>Teixerae</HI> call'd <HI>Chobad-Xirvihé,</HI> in the Tarich or Annal of Time, <HI>Scyrviah</HI>) in the sixth yeare of his reigne was slaine by <HI>Sarbaras. Sarbaras</HI> is by the Persians call'd <HI>Shawryr;</HI> by <HI>Shicard, Shiribar:</HI> in the third moneth of his reigne he slew <HI>Ardohyr ben Xirviah,</HI> right heire to the Crowne: eight moneths after that, is himselfe slaine by <HI>Ioen-sha</HI> or <HI>Shyn-Shaw,</HI> Lord of part of <HI>Taurus.</HI> The successours to this man are uncertainly delivered. The Roman Authors from him to the conquest of <HI>Mahomet</HI> rec∣kon three Kings of <HI>Persia.</HI> The Arabs 6. The Persians 5. The Tarich 4. Teishera 7. The Armenians 11. How can I therefore reconcile them? The most plausible is this. That <HI>Ioon-sha</HI> at the end of three moneths was banisht by <HI>Tuwan</HI> or <HI>Turan Doct</HI> naturall daughter to <HI>Cosrhoe.</HI> She had as bad a fate; at the end of sixteene moneths shee was poysoned and dyed, much lamented: to her followed to <HI>Iazan-Zeddahs,</HI> by the Tarich call'd <HI>Ian-ku-kar-connah;</HI> by <HI>Elmacyn, Gaescan-zedda;</HI> who ruled nine months: to him succeeded <HI>Azurmy Doct</HI> (<HI>Cosrhoes</HI> youngest daughter) who after sixteene moneths dyed; and left <HI>Shezir</HI> (or <HI>Kezir</HI>) to suceed her: who also at the end of six weeks was slaine by <HI>Phorog-Zeddah</HI> (or <HI>Shyriar</HI> as some call him) who after like time, dyed of poyson; and <HI>Yesdgyrd</HI> followed, who was forth∣with made away by <HI>Bornarym,</HI> and he by <HI>Hormisdas;</HI> the last of those 12 vanishing Turrets, <HI>Cosrhoe</HI> saw in a perplexed vision one night after he had beene admiring <HI>Aristotle.</HI> The Period of <HI>Pesia's</HI> command was now ac∣complished. Such time as <HI>Hormisda</HI> after five yeares rule (ten some say; others six;) was slaine by <HI>Omar</HI> the 2 Calyph after <HI>Mahomet:</HI> at which time <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> (whose life and acts I have already spoken of) was borne in <HI>Arabia petrea, Anno Dem.</HI> 574. in the yeare 620 was banisht <HI>Mecca:</HI> and in the yeare 637. May 3 and at the age of 63 dyed, and was buried in <HI>Medina</HI> (<HI>Munichiates</HI> formerly) now call'd <HI>Tal-nabi.</HI> i.e. the Citie of Gods Pro∣phet. From him to <HI>Abbas</HI> I intend to runne over cursarily: and to reject all circumstances.</P>
<P>To <HI>Mahomet</HI> succeeded <HI>Ebubokar, Abdalla Eubochar</HI> some name him. In the great Clymactick yeare he also dyed; suspected to be poysoned: he sat as King of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Caliph,</HI> but two yeares. <HI>Omar</HI> succeeded him. Hee is called <HI>Howmar</HI> and <HI>Homer,</HI> and was sonne to <HI>Kattab-Faruques,</HI> a wealthy Merchant. <HI>Ally</HI> the Persian and sonne in law to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> was by this rest∣lesse <HI>Kalyph</HI> not a little persecuted in his quarell: hee sackt <HI>Bashra</HI> an Ara∣bian Citie, wall'd by <HI>Muslyn;</HI> and as an over-flowing turrent, rusht as farre as <HI>Gabata,</HI> monstrously tyrannizing in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Aegipt;</HI> after that hee ru∣ines <HI>Palestine</HI> and <HI>Iberia,</HI> and as an unluckie comet blazes in <HI>Assyria,</HI> where he full gorg'd his furie. At <HI>Bagdat</HI> hee intends to meditate, but commands <HI>Mavi</HI> to sack <HI>Damascus,</HI> and encourages other his grand Captaines to doe their best to propagate the Alcoran in all Nations. <HI>Rustan beg</HI> with 15000 horse enters <HI>Cusistan,</HI> but at the siege of <HI>Escair-Mecron</HI> is slaine: and in the Armaie <HI>Moses</HI> sirnam'd <HI>Ashar</HI> governed. This wild Arab forced the Citie, and made <HI>Ahawaz, Sabur, Arckan, Cownrestan, Iaarown,</HI> and <HI>Laar</HI> become Mahomitans, and to enroll themselves <HI>Omars</HI> Tributaries. <HI>Habu Obed-ben-Masudh</HI> also with 13000 horse subjected <HI>Irack,</HI> wall'd <HI>Rastack,</HI> and of a poore Towne made it a brave Citie, but new-named it <HI>Kufa</HI> or <HI>Kalufa ô∣phrat,</HI> since then the place of Coronation for the Kings of <HI>Persia:</HI> 'tis 40 miles from <HI>Babylon,</HI> and conjoynes <HI>Mosqued-Ally</HI> the buriall place of <HI>Mor∣tis-Ally</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP>. King, and Prophet to the Persians.</P>
<P><HI>Habu-Obed</HI> next yeare subdued <HI>Wasit</HI> upon <HI>Dig lat;</HI> a Towne agrandiz'd by <HI>Abdal Melq' Anno Dom.</HI> 705. <HI>Heg.</HI> 85. <HI>Elsheer</HI> he also attempted; but in the triall lost 5000 men, <HI>Obed</HI> was slaine and the Saracens rooted. <HI>Omar</HI> reani∣mates his men, and perswades them that the Elsherians overcame them by Art Magique: which also hee knew how to practise. They hope the best and returne to <HI>El-sheyr,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Siet-Bep Abi-Vaker,</HI> who had such luck through <HI>Omars</HI> skill, that <HI>Elsbeyr</HI> was forced to feele his tortures. At <HI>Elcadisia</HI> (a frontier Towne) he slew 25000 Persians, and at <HI>Galula, Spa-hawn,</HI> and <HI>Yezd,</HI> at severall times made <HI>Yezdgirdfly;</HI> who had no com∣fort left him, when he beheld how fortunatly <HI>Omar</HI> himselfe subjected <HI>Cu∣sistan, Parc, Carman,</HI> and <HI>Iraack;</HI> and in <HI>Maqueroon, Iaaroon, Aedgan, Dea∣cow, Lar, Shyraz,</HI> and <HI>Moyoon,</HI> had made all men there sweare themselves true Mussulmen. <HI>Yesdgird</HI> dyes, and <HI>Hormisda</HI> labours to repell the Sara∣cens; but in vaine: an uncontroulable Decree hastned this long slavery and change of <HI>Persia.</HI> 15000 men with himselfe hee sacrific'd as a farwell ende∣vour to his Country. <HI>Omar</HI> also six moneths after this battell was slaine trecherously by a varlet; and in the <HI>Alcaba</HI> in <HI>Mecca</HI> neere to <HI>Ebubocar</HI> bu∣ried. <HI>Ozman</HI> (in despight of <HI>Ally</HI>) succeeded him. <HI>Omar</HI> sat <HI>Kalyph</HI> twelve yeares; ths man ten, and foure months in the Pontificacie. By <HI>Hucba</HI> his
<PB N="281" REF="145"/>
field Marshall he subdued divers parts of <HI>Afrique,</HI> viz. <HI>Mumydia, Mauritania, Lybia,</HI> and as far as <HI>Carthage. Mavi,</HI> Sultan of <HI>Damasco,</HI> also over-ran <HI>Syria, Aegypt,</HI> and in a 1000 Gallyfoists transfer'd such a swarme of Saracens into <HI>Cyprus,</HI> that upon their entry they seemed enough to cover it: there they sackt <HI>Constantia</HI> (or <HI>Ceraunia,</HI> a City built by <HI>Cyrus</HI>) and thence fell upon the <HI>Rhodes,</HI> where they perpetrated all possible villany: &amp; amongst other spoyles they dimolisht that Colossus which was built by <HI>Chares</HI> of <HI>Lyndus,</HI> scholler to <HI>Lysippus</HI> in 12 yeeres. It was 80 cubits high, the thomb as big as a large man, the leggs stood on either side the river, so wide and spatious, that thereunder might sayle a large vessell: in the one hand it held a ja∣velin, which it raised to the East: on its breast was a mirror, wherein those that dwelt far within the Ile might descry Ships sayling at a great distance. This wonder of the world, and which cost 300 Talents, <HI>Mavi</HI> sold to <HI>Emisi∣sa</HI> a Jew for 200 pounds sterlin: who with the brasse of it loded away 930 Camells. In that Ile he also defaced 100 other Colosses and of costly Mo∣numents 73000. During this, <HI>Heraclius</HI> dyed, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 640, after 30 yeeres rule, and in's place <HI>Heracl; Constantinus</HI> succeeded, who in the 7 month of his Empire was poysoned by <HI>Martina</HI> his step-Dome, and <HI>Hera∣clionas</HI> her soone advanced: but were forthwith both of them exiled by the people, their noses and tongues cut out; and <HI>Constans</HI> saluted Empe∣rour in his place.</P>
<P><HI>Osman</HI> by this time had finisht his Paraphrase upon the Alcoran, and di∣gested it into 7 small books, subdivided into 114 chapters. It hapned that by some chance or other he lost a Ring of gold which <HI>Mahomet</HI> left him, and which was to discend to every succeeding Calyph; no paines, no ma∣gick could recover it: he conceales the losse, and made one of silver, em∣bowelling a Motto or Symbol, to this purpose; <HI>O Pertinaces, O Poeniten∣tes:</HI> from which patterne, all Mahomitans to this day weare their Rings of silver.</P>
<P><HI>Osman's</HI> mind fancies new conquests, and under a pretext of charity; to teach those purblind Nations the lesson how to attaine Paradise. <HI>India</HI> in those dayes was rich and well peopled: to any would undertake the im∣ployment he gives a thousand benediction. <HI>Abdall-ben-Emyr</HI> accepts the hazards, &amp; with 30000 horse hasts thitherward; but by new commands from <HI>Osman</HI> who had considered how long a businesse 'twould bee to subdue <HI>India,</HI> he directs his course towards <HI>Tartary. Aria</HI> hee easily subjugated, <HI>Corasan, Maurenahar, Gasuehen;</HI> and took the Cities of <HI>Nizabur, Thalecan,</HI> and <HI>Tocharistan;</HI> yea all <HI>Dilemon</HI> to <HI>Balk,</HI> and as farre as <HI>Iehun</HI> and <HI>Ardoc</HI> would give leave; rivers beyond <HI>Oxus.</HI> But <HI>Osman</HI> how victorious so ere he was abroad, dyed miserably at home of poyson; which he suckt volun∣tarily, rather than be slain by the inraged multitude: in the 88 yeere of his age, of his Calyphship 5 yeeres &amp; 8 months, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 655. <HI>Heg.</HI> 35. and in his place long-lurking <HI>Ally</HI> is saluted King and Calyph: whose reign was full of misery; for <HI>Mavi</HI> stormes at <HI>Osmans</HI> fall, and with 100000 men enters <HI>Arabia</HI> to depose <HI>Ally,</HI> but in th'incouoter lost 10000 men; howbeit at the second tryall <HI>Ally</HI> lost the day, his life, his Empire. Of the Aegyptians were slaine 15000: of Saracens 20000: and by which victory <HI>Mavi</HI> or <HI>Mnavias</HI> was re-saluted King. <HI>Mortis-Ally</HI> dyed aged 63, and was

buried neere to <HI>Cufe</HI> upon <HI>Euphrates;</HI> at <HI>Mosqued</HI> or <HI>Massad-Ally, Karb-Ally,</HI> some have mis-called it. <HI>Mortis-Ally</HI> left a Ring, with which the Persi∣an Kings wed their Kingdome: it's Motto is (say the <HI>Molai</HI>) <HI>Corde Sin∣cero Deum veneror:</HI> by the Persians he is sometimes call'd <HI>Emir-el me∣munni, i.e.</HI> Prince of the feithfull.

<HI>Syet Gunet</HI> his sonne, by the excellent report his Syre had honoured him with, not only inheriting his fathers repute, but so popularly beloved, that he suddenly hatches the ambitious thoughts how to dispossesse <HI>Ioon-Sha</HI> of the Empire. Hee attempts it divers wayes, but finds none so sure as by making a Schisme in their Religion: he therefore dictates a new <HI>Currawn,</HI> wherein he villified &amp; accurst the three successours to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and mag∣nified <HI>Mortis Ally:</HI> adding this, That he was lineally frō him descended. <HI>Ioon-Sha</HI> espies his drift and seeks to kill him: But he (doubting no lesse) avoyds it; and flies into <HI>Armenia,</HI> where <HI>Vsan Cassan</HI> entertained him with all respect possible, and to make it more apparant bestowes his daughter, <HI>Martha</HI> (<HI>Ka∣daijon Katun</HI> the (Persians call her upon <HI>Despyna</HI> daughter, to <HI>Calo-Ioannes</HI> Emperour of <HI>Trepisond</HI>) upon <HI>Aydar</HI> his sonne: on whom he begot two sonnes, <HI>Ally-Sha</HI> sirnamed <HI>Sulyman,</HI> and <HI>Sha-Ismael.

<P><HI>Bajazet</HI> the Turk squints at <HI>Ismaels</HI> greatnesse, having formerly in his appetite devoured <HI>Persia.</HI> But such was <HI>Isamel's</HI> high courage &amp; vertue, that he not only resisted the utmost furie of <HI>Bajazeth,</HI> but also made the Tar∣tars and Indians tremble at his fortune. The Persians honoured him, the Armenians loved him, but the Jewes deified and assured him hee was the Messias they so long wayted for: but <HI>Ismaels</HI> severity towards them upon that blasphemie, made them quickly recant, and rather think him a second <HI>Vespasian.</HI> Ere I goe further, let mee speake a word of his sirname <HI>Sophy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ismael</HI> at his Coronation proclaim'd himselfe King of <HI>Persia</HI> name of <HI>Pot-Shaw-Ismael-Sophy.</HI> Whence that word <HI>Sophy</HI> was borrowed, is much controverted. Whether it be from the Armenian idiom, signifying wooll, of which the Shashes are made that enobled his new order. Whether the name was from <HI>Sophy</HI> his Grandsire, or from the Greek word <HI>Sophos</HI> im∣posed upon <HI>Aydar</HI> at his conquest of <HI>Trepizond</HI> by the Greeks there, I know not. Since then many have called the Kings of <HI>Persia, Sophy's:</HI> but I see no proper reason for it; since <HI>Ismaels</HI> sonne, grand great grand sons Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> never continued that name, till this that now reignes, whose name indeed is <HI>Soffee,</HI> but casuall.</P>

Which done, he hasts back to <HI>Yezd,</HI> hearing that <HI>Mahomet</HI> had besieged it: he quickly rais'd the siege and bur∣ned <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And after hee had compounded some differences 'twixt himselfe and <HI>Morod-sha,</HI> brother to <HI>Alvan; Anno Dom.</HI> 1507. <HI>Heg.</HI> 887, hee journeyed to <HI>Shyraz</HI> where he was solemnly crowned: but next day put to death 30000 men, such as were either guilty of his Fathers death, or had taken part with <HI>Morod</HI> against him.

That yeere hee entertained <HI>Lemius</HI> (the Portugall Agent) at <HI>Cashan;</HI> who was led into the Army by <HI>Mirza Abucaca</HI> the field Marshall: the which <HI>Lemius</HI> reported to <HI>Albuquerq,</HI> that <HI>Ismael</HI> had 350000 Paviilions pitcht there, and in the field 130000 men. That yeere <HI>Bajazeth</HI> was poysonned by a Jew, and in his Place <HI>Selym</HI> his younger son, made Emperor of <HI>Turquy.</HI> That yeere, <HI>Morad</HI> sonne to Sultan <HI>Ac'mat, Bajazeths</HI> eldest sonne, fled to <HI>Ismael</HI> fot safety; and <HI>Aladyn</HI> his brother, to <HI>Campson Gaurus</HI> Sultan of <HI>Aegypt:</HI> where both were welcomed. <HI>Selym</HI> prepares to fetch them thence: but <HI>Ismael</HI> irri∣tates his vexation; and incourages <HI>Morad</HI> with 10000 horse (promising to second him by <HI>Vstref-oglan</HI> with 20000 more) to forrage <HI>Turquy:</HI> ac∣cordingly <HI>Morad</HI> past through <HI>Armenia</HI> the lesse, and in <HI>Cappadocia</HI> shewed himselfe an adversarie. <HI>Chendemus</HI> with great forces opposes him: who upon notice of his Uncles approach, fell back to <HI>Vstref,</HI> and both of them to <HI>Anti-Taurus,</HI> where <HI>Aladules</HI> quietly suffered him to passe the Moun∣taines into <HI>Armenia;</HI> whither they knew ere-long the Grand-Senior would hunt after them. <HI>Selym</HI> commands his whole forces to follow him into <HI>Persia: Chendemus</HI> for diswading him slaine; but <HI>Ebrahim Bass's</HI> ad∣vice after long march into <HI>Armenia,</HI> he got; where in the Calderan plains was fought 'twixt the Turk and Persian a most memorable battell: <HI>Ismael</HI> with 30000 Persians for 16 houres maintaining the fight with <HI>Selymus</HI> and

300000 Turks; and where (if the Turquish Artillery bad not disordered and affrighted the Persian horse) the Persian had gloriously triumphed: but as it was, for one Persian 10 Turks were slaine; and neither of them obtained conquest: the horror of it such, that the Turkish Ann∣alls call that dayes fight, The day of Doom. <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1515. <HI>Heg.</HI> 895, <HI>Selym</HI> returnd with new forces into <HI>Armenia,</HI> but by the way strangled <HI>Aladeules</HI> be Mountanous King: <HI>Ismael</HI> leaves <HI>Synal-beg</HI> to pursue his con∣quest of <HI>Mosendram,</HI> and with 30000 horse, attended <HI>Selym</HI> at <HI>Tabriz:</HI> but <HI>Selym</HI> diverts his first thoughts, and at an unexpected houre enters <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and by the slaughter of the Sultan <HI>Campson</HI> (betrayed by <HI>Cajer∣beg</HI> Sultan of <HI>Aleppo</HI>) conquered it and gave end to that order of <HI>Mama∣lucks</HI> which from Sultan <HI>Saladyne</HI> who lived <HI>Anno Heg.</HI> 896. had continu∣ed with much fame and excellencie: <HI>Tomambeyus</HI> sought to have restored it, but <HI>Selym</HI> made his life the price of it.</P>
<P><HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1514. <HI>Hegaria</HI> 894. <HI>Sha-Tamas</HI> was born, who succeeded <HI>Ismael</HI> in the Empire; in 5 yeeres after, he had also <HI>Hel-cawn, Som-Mirza,</HI> and <HI>Bacram-cawn:</HI> some call them, <HI>Elias, Sormiza,</HI> and <HI>Barhon-cawn.

Anno Domini</HI> 1525. <HI>Heg.</HI> 965. <HI>Ismael</HI> also dyed; in the 40 of his age, and his reigne, 20 yeeres.</P>
<P><HI>Ismael's</HI> foure soones did what they could to ruine the Empire, by one anothers ruine: <HI>Hel-cawn</HI> especially: who to effect it, syded with the Tur∣kish Emperour. <HI>Vlembeg</HI> also (who had married their sister) laboured it. But albeit <HI>Solyman</HI> did his best by his owne forces and by their treasons, yet such was his ill luck, that (excepting <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Tabryz</HI>) they got no∣thing but sad experience: for <HI>Tamas</HI> upon notice of the Turkish entry, leaves <HI>Kazien Bassa</HI> and <HI>Corasan</HI> (which he then had beseiged) and hasts to <HI>Cashyn:</HI> the Turks so soone as they had rifled <HI>Tabryz,</HI> retreat; but are so assailed in the rear by <HI>Delementhes,</HI> still as they marched, that they could not preuent the losse of 40 Cannon, 3 Sansacks, 800 Janisaries, and of Asaps or common men above 20000: a victorie so plausible. that to this day upon the 3 and 10 of Ardabehish or October, tis with many signalls of joy solemnized: 4 yeeres after, as <HI>Morod</HI> had done to <HI>Ismael,</HI> so <HI>Bajazet Solymans</HI> sonne fled to <HI>Tamas;</HI> to save his life, willing to part with his hopes of a Monarchy: his rebellions and injuries to his father and brother had beene many and notable; so as <HI>Hassan Bassa</HI> comes to <HI>Casbyn,</HI> and upon assuring <HI>Tamas</HI> that <HI>Bajazeth</HI> came purposely to kill him, that infortunate Prince was by that old villaine strangled, and his 4 sonnes also; <HI>Homer, Morad, Selymus,</HI> and <HI>Mahomet. Solyman</HI> next yeere enters <HI>Persia</HI> with 150000 men. <HI>Tamas</HI> affrighted with their great ordnance, hyres 5000 Portugalls from <HI>Ormus</HI> and <HI>Indya,</HI> who brought 20 Cannon along with them, and by whose helps the Turks were vanquished. That yeere <HI>Tamas</HI> eatf ed the <HI>Ouz begs</HI> country and retorned victorious: and next into <HI>Cabul;</HI> whence he thought to have gone to <HI>Lahore;</HI> but upon newes that <HI>Mustapha</HI> (<HI>Solymans</HI> eldest sonne and brother to <HI>Bajazeth,</HI> lately at <HI>Casbyn</HI> strangled) was fled from his Father to him from succour, he returnes and welcomes him, willing any way to agrandize discord amonst the <HI>Ottomans. Solyman</HI> in person with 80000 men followes him, in every place hee came that lo∣ved

the Persian, perpetrating all sort of savage cruelty. At <HI>Erez, Tamas</HI> fought with <HI>Solyman,</HI> but with worse successe than formerly neere <HI>Bagdat:</HI> for 1000 Persians were slaine, and 20000 Turks; but by their numbers the Persians were forced to leave the field; which when <HI>Mustapha</HI> saw, fled to his Father and beseeches (for <HI>Roxalana</HI> his Mothers sake) par∣don: but it would not be; his Father forthwith made him to be strangled.</P>
<P><HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1576. <HI>Heg.</HI> 956. King <HI>Tamas</HI> dyed at <HI>Cazbyn,</HI> aged 68; ha∣ving reigned 50 yeeres; and left his eldest sonne <HI>Mahomet</HI> to succeed him: hee had in all, 12 sonnes and 3 daughters; <HI>Maomet, Ismael, Aydar, Sulyman, Emangoly, Morad, Mustapha, Ally, Hamed, Ebrahim, Hamzé,</HI> and <HI>Izma cawn. Ismael</HI> during his stay at <HI>Cohac</HI> complots with <HI>Peria-Conconna</HI> and <HI>Sahamal-can;</HI> by whose help hee strangled <HI>Aydar,</HI> and beheaded 8 o∣ther of his brethren: hopefull also to meet with <HI>Mahomet:</HI> who being fled to <HI>Georgia</HI> finds such friends that ere long he returned with 12000 horse, Curds and Georgians, by whose service, and the valour of <HI>Leventhy∣beg,</HI> he arrives at <HI>Spahawn;</HI> where he had newes of <HI>Ismaels death,</HI> slain in his bed by <HI>Periaconconna</HI> and 4 Sultans, who entred habited like women, <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1577. The same yeere that <HI>Ismael</HI> was thus slain, <HI>Peria-Concanna</HI> was also made away by <HI>Salmas-Mirza,</HI> at the command of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> (call'd <HI>Codobanda</HI> by the Turks) had many sonnes: <HI>Ismael, Mustapha, Mir-can, Guynet, Sophy, &amp;c. Ismael</HI> was famisht to death <HI>Cay∣kahe</HI> Castle neere <HI>Tabriz,</HI> by meanes of <HI>Massombeg</HI> the favorite: the rest of his sonnes dyed untimely. He had also 3 sonnes begot of <HI>Ioon-Conna</HI> Princesse of <HI>Heri</HI> and <HI>Corassan: Emyr-Hamzé mirza,</HI> Sultan <HI>Aydar,</HI> and <HI>Abbas. Emyr-hamze-mirza,</HI> was the most famous, active, and, beloved Prince that ever to this day lived in <HI>Persia.</HI> When he commanded, they thought nothing impossible: the Turks, the Indyan, the Arab, and Tartar feared him; with 40000 horse hee vanquisht 200000 Turks neere <HI>Van,</HI> and cleared <HI>Armenia</HI> of those Locusts. After that, with 30000 Persians and Ouzbeghians hee over-threw them at <HI>Erez,</HI> and obteyned a most glorious victory. Two yeeres after, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1580. <HI>Heg.</HI> 960 at <HI>Bagdat</HI> he beat the Turks; at that time of Persians being slaine 10000, but of Turks 70000. Next yeere, he opposed the Tartar neere to <HI>Sumachy</HI> and slew 20000 of their men: and that same month of the Turks led by <HI>Mustapha Bassa</HI> 100000: but with losse of above 40000 of his owne men. <HI>An. Dom</HI> 1584. <HI>Heg.</HI> 964. neere <HI>Van</HI> againe, he slew above 20000 Turks: and with his own hands slew the Sultan of <HI>Caramit,</HI> the Generall; the Basha of <HI>Trebizond,</HI> and 5 Sanzacks. At <HI>Sancazan</HI> the insuing spring, he also beat <HI>Osman</HI> the Basha (who dyed to think of it) and slew above 23000 other Turks. At <HI>Tephlis</HI> he vanquisht <HI>Sycala</HI> the famous Basha, and slew 30000 of his Turks; the Prince losing 9000 Persians: but by that victory regained <HI>Tabriz, Babylon,</HI> and all other such places as King <HI>Tamas</HI> had <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1537. <HI>Heg.</HI> 917, lost to <HI>Solyman.</HI> Next yeere he took <HI>Derbent</HI> from the Turk, and neere to <HI>Tephlys</HI> with 20000 horse, scattered and slew 80000 Turks: so dismall to <HI>Amurath,</HI> that rather than see his face <HI>Musta∣pha</HI> by voluntary poyson at the age of 78 gave up the ghost, and <HI>Acmat</HI> the renouned Ennuch resolv'd to beg rather than to see <HI>Persia</HI> againe. But
<PB N="290" REF="150"/>
<HI>Synon Bassa</HI> was so puft up with his late conquests (at <HI>Cyprus, Malta,</HI> and, <HI>Aegypt</HI>) that he threatens his payment; and to that end with 100000 men he entred <HI>Georgia,</HI> sackt <HI>Tephlys,</HI> and in <HI>Shervan</HI> did many mischiefes: but plague and famine puisuing him, the Prince of <HI>Persia</HI> ere the Tartar could joyne with <HI>Synon</HI> bad him battell at <HI>Carse</HI> in the Turq'men confines and beat him, but two dayes after lost 5000 men more, and was forced back to <HI>Trepizond:</HI> But at length, what enemies abroad could not effect, at home his brother <HI>Abbas</HI> perpetrated by poyson: insomuch as in the vigor of his age, and hopes of further conquest, this gallant Prince goes down not aged 30; and of such force with purblind <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that in few dayes after hee expired: <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1585. <HI>Heg.</HI> 965. after 8 yeeres reigne, and at <HI>Ardaveel</HI> by his father was some part buried.</P>
<P><HI>Abbas</HI> had much adoe to quiet the distemper of the Persians, such hate they bore him for his cruelty. At <HI>Casbyn</HI> hee found most welcome: they had considered the other two were irrevocable, &amp; that it concerned them to have some expert man to defend them from the Turk, who almost eve∣ry day from <HI>Tabriz</HI> affronted them. <HI>Spahawn</HI> indeed paid deerely for her rebellion. The first yeere of his reigne <HI>Amurath</HI> the Turkish Emperour sent his Ambassador to <HI>Abbas,</HI> to command him (If he desired peace) to send him his sonne <HI>Ismael</HI> as a hostage: the Ambassador had better have stayed at home, for albeit hee escaped with his life, yet hee was mise∣rably bastinadoed. Enraged by that message hee besieged <HI>Tabriz,</HI> and easily forced the Turks thence, as also out of <HI>Van</HI> and all <HI>Armenia:</HI> two yeeres after he beat them out of <HI>Balsorac</HI> and <HI>Bagdat;</HI> yea made <HI>Dyarbec</HI> and <HI>Iaziry</HI> too hot for them. By <HI>Curchiki-can</HI> he subdued <HI>Ghey-lan;</HI> by <HI>Ta∣mas-coolibeg, Mozendram;</HI> by <HI>Ferrat-chan, Candahar;</HI> and by <HI>Lolla-beg</HI> and <HI>Emangloy-cawn, Larr, Cusistan, Carman, Macron,</HI> and part of <HI>Iazirey</HI> or <HI>Arabia:</HI> yea to this last over-throw at <HI>Babylon,</HI> he gave successively to <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> 3, <HI>Acmat, Osman, Mustapha,</HI> and <HI>Amurath,</HI> all of them Grand Seig∣niors, above 20 other severall over-throwes; most of which the Turks conceale, and thence it is that we have them not recorded in our Turkish Histories.</P>
<P>About this time, <HI>Abbas</HI> became inraged against the Georgians: and up∣on this occasion.</P>
<P><HI>Scander,</HI> lake King of <HI>Georgia</HI> (a Countrey confyning <HI>palus Meotis,</HI> 'twixt the Euxin and Caspian seas) by a Sarcashi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Lady had 3 hopefull sonnes; <HI>Scander-cawn, Thre-beg,</HI> and <HI>Constandell:</HI> all borne Chistians; but for preferment the two last named became Bosarmen or circumcised. <HI>Thre-beg</HI> serv'd the Turk; <HI>Constandell,</HI> the Persian. <HI>Constandell</HI> was natu∣rally deforned, but of such an active spirit, that his bodily imperfections were not noted: yet his hatefull ambition rendred him more than mon∣strous. It hapned that <HI>Abbas</HI> vowed some revenge upon the Turk; and to that end gave order to <HI>Ally-cawn</HI> to trouble them. <HI>Constandell</HI> per∣ceives the occasion right to attempt his hellish resolutions, and therefore after long suit got to be joyned in Commission with the Persian Generall. Through <HI>Georgia</HI> they go: where <HI>Costandell</HI> under a pretext of Duty vi∣sits his sad Parents, who (upon his protest that his Apostasy was counter∣feit) joyfully welcomed him: but forgetting that, and all other tyes of
<PB N="291" REF="150"/>
Nature, next night at a solemn banquet caus'd them to be murdered: and till the Georgians saluted him by the name of King, perpetrated all sorts of villanies possible. But how secure soere hee stood in his owne fancie, the dreadfull Justice of an impartiall God retaliated him: the rest of his life proving to this hellish Assassinate infinitly miserable; for first, neere <HI>Sumachan, Cycala's</HI> sonne the Turkish Generall, wounded him in the arme, and by that forfeited the victory to the Persian. That same night he was also assaulted in his tent by his inraged Country-men; who in his place, (for at the first alarme he escaped) cut a Catamite in peeces, his ac∣cursed bed-fellow: and albeit hee so farre exasperated the Persian to re∣venge, that he brought the whole Army into <HI>Georgia,</HI> resolving there to act unparellel'd tragedies; yet was hee over-reacht in his stratagems: for upon parlee with the Queen (his late brothers wife) he was shot to death, at a private signall given by that Amazon to some Musqueteers, ambushed of purpose 'twixt both the Armies. A just punishment for such a viper.</P>

<L>—Nec enim lex justior ulla est</L>
<L>Quam necis artisicis, arte petire sua,</L>
</LG>
<P>But <HI>Abbas</HI> (glad of all advantages to spoyle and conquer) takes the affront as done in his despight, in that <HI>Constandell</HI> was his subject and a Ma∣hometan; and therefore studies their destruction: but such good reasons <HI>Ally-cawn</HI> gave him to the contrary, that hee alters his first intents, and seekes by conferring his best love upon young <HI>Temerisk</HI> their Infant King to oblige their affection: and accordingly returned him into <HI>Georgia</HI> roy∣ally attended, yea made him bee crowned King in <HI>Georgia,</HI> with all cere∣mony requirable. But long these Halcyon dayes endured not; for the Grand Seniors Ambassador at <HI>Spahawn</HI> laboured by all wayes how to sepe∣rate this their Union; &amp; by deceit effected it: First wispering in <HI>Temerisks</HI> eares that <HI>Abbas</HI> hated him; and then made <HI>Abbas</HI> beleeve that <HI>Temerisk</HI> was an undoubted creature of the Grand Seniors: so that (upon <HI>Temerisks</HI> deniall to come to <HI>Abbas</HI>) he enters <HI>Georgia</HI> with 30000 horse, where <HI>Lol∣la-beg,</HI> at his Masters command, made fire and sword equally tyrannicall. <HI>Temerisk</HI> was forced to the Turk, from whom he got such forces, that hee re-entred <HI>Georgia,</HI> and slew the Persique Garrisons, yea forraged beyond <HI>Tephlys</HI> into <HI>Medya:</HI> which so inraged <HI>Abbas</HI> that from <HI>Mosendram</HI> he issued with a greater Army than formerly, and in <HI>Georgia</HI> made a more terrible execution: firing their Churches, houses, and Mulberry-trees; destroy∣ing their silk-wormes, and massacring young and old, without mercy. But so soone as <HI>Abbas</HI> was gone, <HI>Temerisk</HI> re-possessed his desolate Countrey; and by a stratagem of <HI>Morad-cawns,</HI> in some sort requited the Persian: for <HI>Morad</HI> like another <HI>Zopyrus,</HI> deformes his face, flies to <HI>Cazbyn,</HI> and is welcomed: pretends that <HI>Temerisk</HI> had so mutilated him; and that hee resolved to betray him to the Persian. <HI>Abhas</HI> beleeves him, and sends 12 famous Dukes and an Army along with him: but being upon the Geor∣gian Confines, and knowing that the Persians were fearelesse of danger, he issues at midnight from his owne quarter upon them with 500 volun∣tary Georgians (whom hee had appointed should accidentally proffer
<PB N="292" REF="151"/>
their services) with such hideous clamours, that 11 of those Dukes and 700 men were slaine; the rest so terribly affrighted, that they rather chose to dye any other death than hazard any more adventures amongst those Christians. Since which, <HI>Abbas</HI> (by meditation of his Cosel-bashaws, who are most of them Georgians) has firmed a sure friendship with the Geor∣gians.</P>
<P>If I should but memorise his severall victories against the Tartar, Geor∣gian, Mogull, and Arabian; It would be enough to make a Book volumi∣nous. But I promised to weave no circumstances: for if that could have beene accepted of, I had here also spoke his journey and warres of <HI>Arme∣nia;</HI> and his tragick acts against his own children: which in regard I have elsewhere glanced at, I have here pretermitted purposely; this only be re∣membred; That <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> dyed <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1628. <HI>Heg.</HI> 1008. aged 70, having ruled the Persian Empire 43 yeeres; and was buried, part at <HI>Caz∣byn,</HI> part at <HI>Ardaveel,</HI> in the Chappell where are intombed his famous and warlike Progenitors: And albeit in the infancy of his reigne he had beene Tyrannicall, yet such was the Majesty of his aspect, his courage, policy, wis∣dome, &amp; good fortune in all his wars, that never any Prince before him was better beloved, and every way by all Symptoms of Duty and respect, more honoured. His Care to administer Justice; his Zeale to Strangers, whom he ever much regarded, and gave all safety and priviledges to; it beeing his usuall phrase, that Strangers added especially to the lustre of his Court, more than any Domestiq' magnificence; his Labour to increase Com∣merce with other Nations; his Incouragement to Souldiers; his Indul∣gence to Merchants of his owne Nation; and in a word, his great Know∣ledge in History and Philosophy, not only made him to bee adored by his owne, but admired at by Travellers; especially when with him they com∣pared other Emperours and Princes of <HI>Asia,</HI> who suck with delight their native ignorance: and thence it was that <HI>Abbas</HI> went to his grave, with such generall lamentation as made it known that he was their Father, Pro∣tector, and Emperour.</P>
<P>In his place was <HI>Sha-Soffy</HI> (<HI>Abbas</HI> his Grand-sonne) saluted King; whose fathers death and his brothers I have elsewhere remembred.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Sha-Soffy</HI> I will say little, save that since his being King (albeit very young) hee has vanquisht the Turks 4 times: albeit twice the Grand-Seignior was in person to fight with him. Many of his Nobles hee has be∣headed: but in these things argues his just discent from <HI>Ally:</HI> and is as like∣ly as any that reigned before him, to advance the Monarchy of <HI>Persia;</HI> and every way to make it rich, and famous.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Et's now abroad againe: and see what Obser∣vations wee can make in the Ilands circum∣jacing Orientall <HI>Indya:</HI> than which, the world has none richer, pleasanter, or every way more excellent. To encompasse it, we must to Sea againe; for, without such helps there is but little travelling.</P>
<P><HI>Apr.</HI> 13. We took ship at <HI>Swalley:</HI> when, being three or foure leagues off at Sea, the wind came faire and made the liquid bil∣lowes swell so advantagiously, that next day wee lost sight of many pretty marittim Townes, at this day owned by the Portu∣gall: namely <HI>Gundavee, Daman,</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Iohn de Vacas, Chowl, Dabul, &amp;c.</HI> most of them subjected by <HI>Don Albuquerq'</HI> about the yeare after th'incarnation of our Saviour 1512; <HI>Dabul</HI> (<HI>Dunga</HI> of old) excepted, which yeelded to the mercie of <HI>Symon Andradius</HI> Governour of <HI>Choul;</HI> from whom 'twas rapt by the Decanees, but by that made a Basis of greater calamity. For, <HI>Al∣meyda</HI> some few yeares after by stratagem recovered and burnt it to the ground: but by command of the <HI>Goan Vice-roy</HI> 'twas repaired, repopula∣ted, and stood victorious; till Captaine <HI>Hall</HI> (if I mistake not the mans name) about nine yeeres agoe forced it; and made th'insulting Portugall know, how their bravadoes, to the English were no way formidable.</P>
<P>The South point of DABUL has Artick Elevation 17 deg. 35 minuts; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dabul.</NOTE> variation West, 15 degrees 34 minuts. It once obeyed the Monarch of <HI>Decan;</HI> but at this day the Lusitanian.

The Towne it selfe is beautifull to such as view it at distance: the houses are low &amp; thick, and tarras't at the top; serving both to lenifie the scorch∣ing flames of wanton <HI>Phaeton,</HI> and to resist the quick and subtill rage of <HI>Hyem's</HI> icyles: an old Castle and a few Temples or Monasteries are all

she boasts of, the Buzzar or Forum is but ordinarie, the streets narrow are: nor is her mart now notable; <HI>Surat</HI> and <HI>Cambya</HI> to the North; <HI>Goa</HI> and <HI>Calicuth</HI> to the South so much eclipsing her; that she condoles with other her disconsolate neighbours, and acknowledges a secret destinie &amp; change in Townes as well as other temporaries.</P>
<P>CHOUL (in <HI>Ptolmyes</HI> dayes call'd <HI>Comane,</HI> if <HI>Castaldus</HI> guesse right) is subject to like varietie: it is removed from the Aequi-noctiall 18 degrees 30 minuts North: and was ravisht from the Emperiall Dyadem of <HI>Decan</HI> (or <HI>Decanory</HI>) by <HI>Almeyda</HI> that ambitious Portugall in the yeare of our re∣demption 1507, and in which (to perpetuate his Conquest) hee erected a gallant Fort or Bulwark, &amp; planted it with Cannon: a Castle also no lesse fortified; so terrible to the Indyans, as they have forborne to make them rore, doubting the very clamour may undoe them. The Inhabitants are a few melancholy but lustfull Portugalls, and some peacefull crafty Ban∣nyans: it affoords naught else to be spoken on in this place. The Expedition bearing up to speak with us, both ships fell foule (to speak in <HI>Neptunes</HI> lan∣guage) or thwart one anothers houlses; by which mischance her bole∣sprit gave our mizzen shrouds a churlish kisse; but by a happy gale parted without farther inconvenience. After five dayes sayle wee were Na∣dyr to the Sunne, at that instant in our Verticé or Zenyth; his decli∣nation then being just fifteene degrees; and we close by the Ile incyrcling <HI>Goa,</HI> a gallant Citie, the Metropole and seat of the Spanish Viceroy and Archbishop, the Citie I have formerly described: haste wee therefore to other places. The wind was favourable a while; but ere long becalmed, whereby the ayre inflam'd, and Sea gave a fierie reflection; to sweat and live like Salamanders was no novel thing with us to suffer bravely all mu∣tations; <HI>Coelum non animum,</HI> was a verified Motto, and serv'd in generall to comfort us. The three and twentieth of Aprill we got to <HI>Mangalore</HI> a Citie obeying the <HI>Mallabar,</HI> in whose road wee found thirty or forty Fri∣gads of <HI>Mallabar</HI> men of warre, who durst not insult upon their numbers, but choose rather to avoyd, and accordingly all together hoist saile towards <HI>Goa;</HI> one onely miscarrying, suffering a while the <HI>Ionas</HI> her Barge to do∣mineere, but after variable strife by rowing and augmenting canvasse got away, with some short in her side, and many wounded. That same night we came to an anchor in <HI>Mount Elly</HI> or <HI>Delyns</HI> bay, a Towne and Port ac∣knowledging vassalage to the Mallabar: wee rode in nine fadoms, not above three neerer the shore. Gladly wee would have landed, but durst not be too prodigall of our beliefe; they seemed willing, wee knew them treacherous; but seeing wee had discoverd their villany, they ventur'd aboard our ships, they knew us mercifull: they fill'd their Canoes with Coco's, Mangoes, Jacks, greene Pepper, Caravance or Indyan Pease, Buf∣falls, Flesh, Henns, Eggs, and other things, sold us not at very easie prices; but (what principally vext us) also made us pay for every tun of water a Ry∣all or foure shillings foure pence: and though they hand plenty of it, yet grudg'd exceedingly to shew us any curtesie in that common element, in fringing by that their barbarisme, the law of Nature and Nations; one of their owne religion (but more morall) shall accuse them.</P>

<P>And that we have such variety of choyce fruits, suffer a little entertain∣ment; the banquet is seasonable in these paralells: but first perfume the place with <HI>Calambuco</HI> wood (a <HI>lignum vitae,</HI>) and to imitate the Aegyptians, place we a deaths-head, as an object of mortality.</P>
<P>The Bannyans in these parts are as superstitious as any other where, and arrogate as much vainglorious ceremony in their Funeralls: transcending in cost and curiosity as the Carcasse differ'd ere-while from others in Estate and Quality: the richer sort have redolent gums, or aromatick odours of <HI>Arabia</HI> incendiated or put to flames, wherein the dead body is laid, in∣volv'd in linnen pure white, sweet, and delicate; or in Taffataes of trans∣parent finenesse: of all sorts of wood they affect that called <HI>Aquila,</HI> and the older kind nam'd <HI>Calamba;</HI> or <HI>Calambuca;</HI> trees, rare, sweet, and pretious; of admirable height and evennesse, found commonly in the lofty Moun∣taine of <HI>Chaemoys</HI> in <HI>Cochyn-chyna;</HI> and which, these people sell at exces∣sive rates; both in regard the Bannians delight to have it in their Obsequies, as that the Japonians so much valew it. They imagine no pillow whol∣somer, no thing more efficacious for health, than that to sleep upon. They extreamly hate such as have doun or what their heads may sink into; both, for that it heats the blood, and pertubs the fancy: you now may view your fruits asore you. I will select the rarest, and first present a short description: here are faire and juycy Lemons, Pappaes; Coco's, Bananas, or Plaintains, sweet and delicious: the Orenges may tempt a tast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orenges.</NOTE> they are succulent and dainty, of so curious a relish as affects the eater beyond mea∣sure, and offer the rynd no lesse pleasant than the juyce, both which seeme to have dulcity &amp; acrimony mixt together. The Bannana's is no lesse dain∣ty: the tree mounts not high, but spreads in a most gracefull posture: the fruit is long, not unlike a Sossage in shape, in tast most excellent:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plantans</NOTE> they ripen though you crop them immaturely; and from a dark-greene, mellow into a flaming yellow: the rynd peeles off very easily; the fruit put into your mouth, dissolves and yeelds a most incomparable relish; the Windsor or Pome-crittien are to it farre inferiour.</P>
<P>The Jack or Giack growes upon a hyer tree, uneasie to bee ascended:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iiack.</NOTE> the Jack for shew and quantity resembles a Pompeon; without; 'tis a gold yellow, commixt with veins; within, is soft and tender; full of golden co∣loured cloves, each full of kernells, not unlike a great French Bean, some∣what more globous: all of them comprise abone or stone not manduca∣ble, except being boyld the Buffols eat it: the fruit is somewhat unplea∣sant at first gust, the heat and rarenesse causes it: 'tis glutinous and clam∣my in the mouth, but of double benefit in the stomack, being restorative, and good for the back; but of singular use against that French disease, they brought from the hot warres at <HI>Naples;</HI> whither the lustfull Spaniard brought it, with his Idol-gold from ravisht <HI>Indya.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="154" MS="y"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ananas.</NOTE>The Ananas is not inferiour to the Jack in bulk, in roundnesse; yet is the plant or parent it spung from no way equall: it arises from no seed nor sowing, but from a root like to an Artichoak: at maturity they shew themselves, and affect not above two foot height, the better and with lesse labour to inrich the gatherer: without, 'tis armed with a moystlesse rynd, hard and skalee; within, is wholsome and pleasant: and though a little seeme to satiate the appetite, yet experience teaches us the stomack co∣vets it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duroyen.</NOTE> and admits an easie digestion. The Duroyen somewhat resem∣bles the Jack: the shape is round, the out-side bravery no way parellells the intrinsique vertue: at first opening it gives a smell not unlike a rotten Onyon, to many seeming odious and offensive: the meat is whitish, divided into a dozen cells or partitions, fild with stones as big as Chez-nuts, white and cordiall: in <HI>Malacca,</HI> and <HI>Iava</HI> they abound, &amp; are worth the inquiring after: a fruit, nutritive and dainty; yea, without an hyperbole may well bee called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arecca.</NOTE> an Epitomè of all the best and rarest fruits throughout the O∣ryent. Arec and Betele also is here much used. The Arecca tree aspires in height like to a Caedar, but rather simulates the Palmëto. It is a fuzzy con∣cave substance, decorated at the very top with plumes, wherein the fruit hangs in clusters: 'tis shaped like a Wall-nut and of like bignesse; white within, not easily penetrated; has no taste, smell, nor sapor: they never eat it alone, but wrap it in a leafe of Betel, and chaw it in many severall mor∣sells: some (as I have noted amongst the Mohelyans) adde to it a kind of Lyme of Oyster-shells; all which together, cures the chollick, removes melancholy, kills wormes, helps <HI>Venus,</HI> purges the maw, and prevents hunger.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Elly</HI> is in 12 deg. latitude; in 55 deg. 30 min. longitude; variation 13 deg. as eminent in precipitious hills as any other part of <HI>Indya,</HI> and limits the two rich and populous Kingdomes, <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Mallabar.</HI> To me it gave this resemblance, as wee rode before it: where ere wee weighed anchor,

an unhappy accident hapned; and thus: On the five and twentieth day, at the point of the Bay we saw a Junck of about seventy Tunnes: fraught with merchandize, bound for <HI>Acheen,</HI> a mart Towne in the Ile <HI>Sumatra:</HI> neere her skulkt a <HI>Mallabar</HI> Pirat, with a full intent to board her when she was off at Sea; and out of our view, hopefull of a booty: the poore Junck perceiving the danger, chose rather to put her selfe into our mercy, than hazard the rapine of that Frigat; but her fortun was little bettered; for, the

boarding her with her Barge tow'd her to our <HI>Admirall,</HI> and (after short consultation) agreed she was a prize, good &amp; warrantable; riches too oft cause causelesse destruction; for doubtlesse had it bin poore,it had escaped; but the great store of Cotton, Opium, Onyons, and somewhat under the Cotton (of most value) made them be adjudged Slaves; eighty able fel∣lowes receiving the brand of hatefull villanage. The <HI>Ionasses</HI> men, not content with so much wealth and conquest, unworthily and without cause fell upon those disarmed Negroes and beat them cruelly; a wretched va∣lour to actuate in rage where they knew was no resistance; but rather than suffer so much insolence, threescore of those wretches threw themselves headlong into the Sea, desiring rather to expose their carcasses to such a hazard though therby their lives were terminated, than by such cruelty, or a lingring slaverie to be in a perpetuall torture: and albeit it seemed sport to many insolent Saylers, in me I assure you, it bred compassion, to see so many miserable Infidells throw themselves downe-right into hell; at that instant in stead of rest beginning an endlesse unquietnesse: the Canoos from the shore sav'd some of them; those our Boats saved were not joy∣full; seeming more willing to be drowned than be sold to the Banta∣neses, who proffer 50 Ryalls for one man, but shew them no mercie to their dying day. That night we had terrible weather, many furious gusts commixt with thunder, raine and lightning assaulting us; wee admired it, but such as live so neere the Sun say, That weather there is usuall. Thence we sayled due South, and that evening past by <HI>Cananor,</HI> in view of us: by <HI>Montingue,</HI> by <HI>Onor</HI> and <HI>Batticala</HI> next day; and then by <HI>Mangalor</HI> (<HI>Mandagara</HI> of old,) <HI>Calicut, Cochyn, Crancanore</HI> (in 10 degr. 12 minutes) <HI>Coulam, Brin Iohn,</HI> to Cape <HI>Comery,</HI> the utmost promontory of <HI>Mallabar,</HI> in seven degrees and a halfe, North; var. 14 degr: by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> called <HI>Cory;</HI> by <HI>Strabo, Conomancina;</HI> by <HI>Pliny, Calasca; Comar</HI> by <HI>Arrhyan;</HI> by other ancient Cosmographers <HI>Calligicum</HI> and <HI>Calingon:</HI> at this day by the Inha∣bitants, <HI>Tuttan-Cory;</HI> where, ere we passe further, wee will essay the cu∣stome, habit, and superstition of the Mallabars, with such as mix among them; but differ in descent, garb, and religion: this serving as our caveat there, and in other places.</P>

<P>I Account so farre <HI>Mallabar,</HI> as is included 'twixt Cape <HI>Comry</HI> and twelve degrees North, neere about <HI>Batticala;</HI> foure hundred miles in length, in breadth no where above a hundred; yet so populous, that the Samoryn or King of <HI>Callicut</HI> is at any time able to affront the <HI>Narsingan, Decan,</HI> or <HI>Gulcundan</HI> Kings (his borderers) with 200000 men: his Country is green and full of all delights, cattell, corne, fruit, cotton, silkwormes, and other merchandizes; store of strong Townes, safe Harbours (not inferiour to those at <HI>Goa, Choul, Dabul, Swally,</HI> or at <HI>Danda-ragea-poree</HI>) as <HI>Coulam, Co∣chyn, Calycut, Mangalore, &amp;c.</HI> and to say truth the Ocean it selfe 40 leagues

<P><HI>Mallabar</HI> is subdevided into many Toparchyes, all obeying the Samo∣reen, a naked Negro, but as proud as Lucifer; swarthy and tyrannicall:
<PB N="301" REF="155"/>
the Nayroes are his Lords; a sort of Mamaluck; they live by the sweat of other mens browes, lust wholy masters them; they goe no whither but are as well armed as if friends &amp; enemies had no difference. <HI>Maffaeus,</HI> improperly imagines them a kind of Braminy, to no sort of people more unlike; the Bramyns being men of peace; the Nayro, ever quarelling: their armes are clad with Armolets of silver, or Ivorie; they walk no whither without sword and target; and have such a superstitious conceit of their owne merit and temper above other men, that wheresoere they meet a vulgar fellow, they clamour <HI>Nayro,</HI> vibrate and clash their sword and shield together, and so passe without opposall; but that no poore man dare looke them in the face or come within fifty paces of them, <HI>Thevet, Vertoman,</HI> and <HI>M. P. Venetus</HI> have so reported I know; but either the cu∣stomes have altered, or I must call the one a deceitfull Monk, and the other two too credulous Travellers.</P>
<P>The extent of <HI>Mallabar</HI> I have given you. The people generally are big limb'd, strong, cole black, and weare their haire (more like wooll than haire) long, and curled; about their heads they wreath a small but curi∣ous sort of lynnen wrought with gold and silk: their waist is circled with a peece of Callico, which makes them modest ; from the thigh downward, and from their middle upwards, are surely naked. The vulgar sort weare about their waist a parti-coloured Plad (like Barbars Aprons) and pinck their skin in many places. The women (such as credit <HI>Mahomet</HI>) vaile them∣selves like other Indyans: such as affect gentilisme covet nakednessce: their greatest ornament and pride is in their eares and noses; they suppose them most brave, most courtly, who can teare or dilacerate their eares widest (which they effect by many ponderous bables they hang there,) and ring their snouts with silver, brasse, or Ivorie: their armes and leggs also are chained richly. The Ethnique marriages want not superstition: where God is not knowne, the devill invelopes and traines them up in mystique darknesse: one same ceremonie is observed by King and Pesant. Whoever marries, he enjoyes not the first nights embraces with his Bride; a vene∣rable custome transferres all maydenheads unto the Braminy, who (to shew their obedience to the law) accept the motion and first season her; it betides happinesse ever after: they suppose the ground richer, the crop excellenter, which receives such holy seed; and promises such future Har∣vests of contentednesse: no marvell then, to see a Priest enter where hee pleases, discourse when and where he will, the good man joying at their privacie; since they are in apparition terrhene Idolls: But, which is more than marvellous, the King not knowing whether his children be of his be∣getting; to make sure work, conferres the Empire on his sisters issue; assu∣red it seemes that shee is of his blood, and they of his by consequence: a very simple Sophistry, grounded upon custome more than reason.</P>
<P>The men, what they want in Sciences, supply by a surpassing courage and pollicie; the Portugals at their first intrenching on their shore, thought them silly, because unlearned; easie to be overcome, because covered with an indefensive nakednesse: but both conceits deceived them: they found (by sad experience) Nature had instructed them in their owne de∣fence, and that no Cannon nor iron is so violently dangerous as revenge

precipitated, exasperated by contempt and where furie rageth: howbeit, by long warres, they are growne expert and orderly: yea know how to play with Cannons, have as great store of Harquebuzes, and are as well ac∣quainted with the force of powder, as we or any other Nation: in all fights, they also use bow and arrow, darts and targets, granads and variety of fire-works; of which they have such store, that they proffered us as much and of what sorts we would, so we returned them money. Their Country abounds with mineralls and stones of lustre: no part is without abundance of fruits and provision: generally (especially by the Sea) tis woody and mountanous. We will a-shore at <HI>Callicut</HI> the Metropolis.</P>
<P>CALLICVT (ten leagues from that place wee tooke our prize) is thought to be that Towne <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls <HI>Canthapis,</HI> a Citie in 23 deg. an er∣ror broacht by <HI>Niger</HI> and <HI>Bertius.</HI> It was above a thousand yeares ago call'd <HI>Callicaris:</HI> was then knowne, but now is famous; and had beene of more trade and excellence, had she prosperd against the continuall bravadoes of the Portugall: who when they fail'd to conquer her, (did with her as <HI>Se∣leuchus</HI> did with <HI>Babylon</HI>) transferr'd their trade to other Townes, and di∣verted her Merchants to other places; whereby in small time it became halfe desolate. It declines from the Aequator towards the North-Pole, eleven degrees: and from its standing in the burning Zone must needs be hot, if not sulphureous: the earth is but meanly fruitfull in grasse, <HI>Apollo</HI> eats it up; but, her gardens by industry and help of some brooks are green, spatious, and redundant in variety of choise fruits. The Citie it selfe is large, but of no beauty: the houses are low, and thick, and dark: the har∣bour is a pretty way distant from the Town, and but indifferent to anchor in: it shewes two great Forts, built <HI>Anno</HI> 1515 by the Portuguise; unfor∣tified and in a sort raized by the Mallabar; the <HI>Samoreen</HI> or Emperour in this place usually abiding: a Prince of great power and awe: black as the devill, and as treacherous: is also of his religion, and makes him heire to all his offrings. Many deformed Pagatho's are here worsshipped: they say they adore not the Idolls, but the Deumos they represent, and who sometimes enter and Oraculize: the Chappel where the grand <HI>Caco-Deumo</HI> sits is un∣covered, and about three yards high; the wooden entrance is ingraven with infernall shapes: within, their beloved <HI>Priapus</HI> is imperiously in∣throniz'd upon a brazen Mount: they advance his head with a resplendent Dyadem, from whence issue foure great Rams hornes, denotating some especiall mysterie: his eyes squint, his mouth opens like a Port-cullice, and from thence branch foure monstrous tusks; his nose is flat; his beard like the Sunnes rayes, of an affrighting aspect; his hands are like the clawes of a Vulture; his thighes and legs, strong and hayrie; his feet and taile re∣semble a Monkeys: which put together, renders the devill wickedly de∣formed, and the idolaters beyond all measure grosse Demonomists: Other Temples have other Pagods; ugly, all: yet all differ in invention: some of them are painted or smeered black; others red: some bright; others de∣vouring soules; hell fictitiously tormenting white ones: These Gods of theirs are of the old stamp: they seeme to threaten and to take notice of mens offrings: but what They cannot doe, their Baalyms effectuate. Each morne, the Priest (a Jogue) perfumes and washes them: it seemes the De∣vill
<PB N="303" REF="156"/>
ever pollutes and leaves a base smell behind him: he departs not with∣out a benediction; humbly he prostrates his corps and has it granted him. Every new Moone they solemnly sacrifice a live Cock as a Symbol of lust and courage; in themselves predominating; the Priest is pontifically atty∣red in pure fine Lawne, arm'd with a sharp long silver knife, his armes and leggs garnisht after the Morisco mode with bells, round silver plates and other jangling trifles: after he has bravely sacrific'd the yeelding Cock, he fills his hands with Ryce, goes retrograde, not daring to looke on any other object save his Idoll; till being come neere an Acherontique lake, he then turnes, there embowells his offring, advancing his hands some set times above his head, and so returnes crown'd with applause and blessed in other mens opinions. The Samoryn eats not till it be first offred, and so ac∣knowledges his food sent him from the <HI>Deumo,</HI> i. e. by the devills permis∣sion: what he leaves, is not for the poore; the Crowes expect it: good reason too, They think them the Devils serviteurs. The people to this day retaine some commendable customes amongst 'em: they commonly ex∣change their Wives one for anothers, nor seeme the women angry at it; Poligamy is sufferable: but in this they differ from other libidinous Law∣givers; as the men have many wives, so one woman may here have many husbands: the issue is bequeathed as she nominates.</P>
<P>COVVLAM is a Towne and Province (call'd <HI>Sopatpa</HI> in <HI>Arrhyan</HI>) in 9 degrees North, and included in the <HI>Travanzorian</HI> Kingdome. Once it obeyed the <HI>Narsingan</HI> Monarch; once the <HI>Mallabar;</HI> at this day, neither. 200 yeares agoe, the Towne was rich, and great, and populous; traded to by many Indyans, augmented by the Samoryn, and able to number a hun∣dred thousand inhabitants: of such value was the scituation for trade, se∣curity for anchorage, and fidelity of the Coolamites. But now, whither her glasse is runne, the period of her excellence out-runne; or that <HI>Cal∣licut</HI> first, and then <HI>Goa</HI> have attracted her custome and resort, I cannot say; this I may: at this day shee is vailed with a sable habit, desolate and disconsolate; shee contemplates the mutability of Times, and other's dis∣asters; and then comparing them with her owne, sees they conclude in a like Center.</P>
<P>And albeit I have in many places memoriz'd the Bannyans; here al∣so I may name them, where they swarme in multitudes, and suck in the sweetnesse of gaine, by an immeasurrble thirst and industry; but (<HI>Sic vos non vobis</HI>) it is ravisht from them by Drones, the lawlesse Moores and Gentiles, who Lord it over them. Alas! the Bannyan is no swaggerer, no royster: he hates domineering and fighting, yea will suffer himselfe to be fleec't by any man, rather than shed blood by any unhappy contention: they love no tumult, no innovation; but wish that all men were of their mind; that is to say, courteous in behaviour, temperate in passion, mode∣rate in apparell, abstemious in dyet; humble, mercifull, and so innocent, as not to undoe the silliest vermin: doubting that if they should destroy any living thing, thereby they might dispossesse their parents or deare friends of a peacefull Mansion; but by eating such, may peradventure devoure the soules of such as once were dearest to them. <HI>Ovids</HI> conceit is partly for them.</P>

<P>In both <HI>Asiaes</HI> the Gospell was throughly preached: but now the subtle∣ty of Satan, and that carnall law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> have infected these soule-sick Nations: for all which, Christ has his flock there, which though at this time scattered, yet in due time shall be gathered, and made one blessed company. In <HI>Persia</HI> are many thousand Christians; in <HI>India</HI> a no lesse multitude; compared indeed to other Idolaters, but a hand-full: yet that does not discourage them: 'tis better go to heaven alone, than to hell with an innumerable multitude: <HI>Arnobius</HI> of old times could say <HI>Nationibus cunctis nos sumus Christiani.</HI> In many marittim Townes of <HI>India,</HI> that name is honoured. In <HI>Meliapore, Narsinga, Coolan, Gucurran, Curigan, Bipur, Tanor, Battacala, Onor, Cranganor, Goa,</HI> and other places are Chri∣stians: yea, in many Indian Iles some are numbered: among Mahomitans they have freedome of conscience from that <HI>Azoara</HI> in the Alcoran, That none are to be diswaded from the religion they suckt from their cradle: amongst Panyms, from that rule of Nature; Use others, as thou would'st others should use thee. The Christians in these parts differ in some things from us and the Papacie; yet retaine many principles of the Orthodox and Catholick doctrine: Lets enter their Temples. Their Churches are low and but poorely furnished; their vassalage will reach no further: whether from their subjection, or that (so the Temples of their bodies bee reple∣nisht with vertue) the excellency of buildings conferre not holinesse, I know not: neat they are, and sweetly kept; matted, without seats, and in∣steed of Images have some select and usefull texts of holy Writ obviously writ or painted. They assemble and haste to Church each Lords day with great alacrity: at their entring they shut their eyes and contemplate the holinesse of the place, the exercise they come about, and their owne un∣worthinesse: as they kneele, they look towards the Altar or Table, neere which the Bishop or Preist is seated, whom they salute with a low and humble reverence; who returnes his blessing by the up-lifting of his hands
<PB N="305" REF="157" MS="y"/>
and eyes: at a set houre they begin prayers, above two houres seldome continuing: first they have a short generall confession, which they follow the Priest in, and assent in an unanim Amen: then followes an Exposition of some part or text of holy Scripture: during which, their attention, dejected lookes, and silence is admirable: they sing an hymne, and at par∣ting out of Church, re-salute the Minister; who ceases not (till all be gone out) to elate his hands and blesse them. When they are come home they read a chapter in either Testament, both which they suppose they have in∣corrupt after the Originalls, and translated for them by Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle and patron of the Orient: they have it also in the Chaldy; but none save the Clergie understand it: every first Sonday in the Month, the Priest reads a Sermon out of an old Homily, writ (as they say) by the Apostle or some of his Disciples: they Baptise commonly at the 40 day, if the Parents do no sooner desire it, they first signe the Infant on the fore∣head with the Crosse, and then wash it all over with water: the Sacra∣ment of the Lords holy Supper they administer in both kinds; the Commu∣nicants receive it (reverently) kneeling: they observe two dayes strict preparation, during which they eat no flesh, revell not, accompanie with no women: in the Church they confesse their sinnes and demerits with great reluctancy: They marry as wee do: the Clergie marry but once; the Layety but twice; widdowes if they marry before the yeere be expi∣red (after which their husbands dyed) are ill reported of, and hazard their joyncture: none (save for adultery) have lycence to part till death sever them. In sicknesse the Priest is sent for to comfort them, and to give the Eucharist, if it bee heartily desired: that done, they take farwell of their wife, and children, and all others; and so rid themselves of carnall distracti∣ons; which too oft hinder the desired meditation, of the misery of world∣lings; and by a holy contemplation of the ineffable joyes of heaven, strive to mitigate the pangs of their disease, yea the grim aspect of approaching Death; and the survivers rather joy than mourne as they solemnize his fu∣neral: they first wash, then wrap the Corps in clean linnen; &amp; a few selected friends concomitate it to the grave, wherein they place it looking (not East, but) West towards <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> five dayes after that they visit his Fami∣ly. They feast and fast as we: their Lent or abstinence from flesh and the like, begins each spring, and is strictly observed fortie dayes, without ban∣quet or bravery: their yeare is Soli-genian: our three cheefe Feastivalls they celebrate, in July they commemorate the martyrdome of Saint <HI>Thomas:</HI> they have many Patriarchs or Protomists, the cheife resides at a house built upon a high mountaine, nine miles from <HI>Cranganor.</HI> Since the Portugalls traded <HI>Indya</HI> they have shaven their heads: the Layicks pay <HI>De∣cimae</HI> or Tythes willingly: they affect justice, truth, peace, humility, obe∣dience, &amp;c. and acknowledge Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> (some the Eunuch of <HI>Arabia,</HI> converted by <HI>Philip</HI>) their Tutelary Saint, and Patron. They beleeve no Purgatory.</P>

<P><HI>ZEyloon</HI> (or <HI>Ceylon,</HI>) one of those five Iles <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls <HI>Barussae,</HI> was not innominate to the Antients.

It is limitted from 8 to 11 deg. of latit. North; the length is about 70 leagues; breadth 40, and circuit 250 or thereabouts: an Ile famous in some old con∣jectures, as that Paradise was here; &amp; that K. <HI>Salomon</HI> had hence his obrize gold or gold of <HI>Ophyr;</HI> but I beleeve neither, in regard most writers fix the ruines of the one in <HI>Mesopotamia;</HI> and the other rather in <HI>Pegu, Iava,</HI> &amp; those wealthy places. The most memorable is this, That <HI>Meleck</HI> (or <HI>Melchior</HI>) <HI>Pyramal,</HI> King of this Iland is thought one of those wise-men (premonisht by that prophesy of <HI>Balaam</HI> the Edomite in <HI>Num.</HI> 24. 17.) that brought (as to a King, a Priest, a Prophet,) Gold, Frank-insence, and Myrrh, unto our blessed Saviour; foretold also by the Persian Sybill, and by a new made Starre guided by the finger of God, miraculously directed: and who at his returne made knowne the mystery of Gods Incarnation, for mans redemption; &amp; by his laborious teaching made many Proselites; some to this day by tradition memorising him, and reteining somewhat of Chri∣stian knowledge, though the greatest part bee Apostats; and drunk with abominable demonomy and superstition. But whether <HI>Melchyor</HI> returned (upon Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> his arrivall) and with the other two came into <HI>Europe,</HI> and whether those three buried in <HI>Cullen</HI> be fictitious or no; it is not per∣tinent to a Travellers curiosity to insist upon. But this is obvious in Histo∣ry, That <HI>Candaces</HI> Noble Eunuch, baptised by <HI>Philip,</HI> left her service to preach Christ; whom very fruitfully he made knowne to many parts of <HI>Araby</HI> and sundry Iles; as <HI>Socotora,</HI> this, and <HI>Tabrobane,</HI> or <HI>Sumatra;</HI> as <HI>Dorotheus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Tyre,</HI> in the dayes of the great and godly <HI>Constan∣tine</HI> witnesseth.</P>
<P>The honour of the first Christian European discoverie, we owe to <HI>Lau∣rentius</HI> sonne of the brave <HI>Almeyda</HI> the Portugall Generall, about the yeare 1500: not altering the name from what the Natives named it.

But the King (more rich than crafty) to shew how little hee regarded the losse of so much uselesse barks of Trees, and (I know no other reason) to set a better edge upon the monstrous appetite of the leane faced Portugall, invites them to see him walk upon a Tarrass, arrayed in an imbrodered coat thick powderd with gold, Smaragds, Pearle and Diamond all together darting out rayes of a most wonderfull delight and luster: to which (albeit <HI>Phoebus</HI> did his best to encrease the splendour,) yet (as if that wanted glory) 500 Flam∣beauxes were put is flames to make this miserable Prince seeme able to strike men dead with his dazeling glory.

The people be blackish, blockish, and unapt for studie or exercise: Heat (which here predominates) debelitates their appetite, and invites them to too much ease (the Mother of luxurie;) a small, thin, but very fine Shuddery or vaile of Lawne is drawne afore their secret parts; their head also has a small wreath, the rest is exposed to view and weather. They want no gold, stones of value, nor such things as the Merchant co∣vets; but they prize them as we doe Trifles. Any religion is tolerable: so that some praise <HI>Mahomet,</HI> some a Dog, others a Crocodile, and some love senselesse Pagods. The Banyan wives here have more freedome to burn themselves to ashes at the Funerall of their husbands, than where the Moores have command; so that in this Coast the custome is usuall.

She goes attended with a mighty company; some for love, most for No∣velty. The Priest all the way describes the rare joyes she is going to; she grants a modest smile, trips on, and upon sight of the flame, seemes trans∣ported beyond measure; she sees the carcasse of her Husband layd upon a pyle of pretious wood, and when the fire begins to embrace him, like a mad Lover shee bids Farwell to her Parents, children, and friends, and wil∣lingly incorporates her selfe with fire; which quickly makes them one, and nothing; nothing extant save fame, flame, and ashes.

Howbeit, the Devill so wrought (by Gods permission) that some apost atizd and inraged the multitude, so that in a common furie they both suffered, the one was shot to death, the other brayned, and both crowned with glorious martyrdome, thirty yeares after our Saviours passion. And, however <HI>Abdias Babylonicus</HI> (who writ that after their deaths they appeared and preached againe their former do∣ctrine,) may seeme doubtfull, this is certaine that in Memory of their cru∣ell ingatitude, the divine justice hath marked their posterities, (as some Jewes say the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin</HI> are to this day, who of all others were most fierce against our Saviour of the Tribe of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Iudah</HI>) so these have one leg as big againe in the calfe as is the other. Notwithstanding the peoples rage, the two noble Martyrs had each his sepulcher, and to this day was a receptory of many native and other holy Christians; till about fiftie yeares since, their skulls and bones were brought a way and (as ho∣ly relicks) at this day kept in the Virgins church in <HI>Ioa</HI>) by command of <HI>Iohn</HI> 3 of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who sent <HI>Emanuel Frias</HI> (guided by <HI>Alphonsus Sousae</HI>) to that purpose.</P>
<P>Many strange reports I could give yee out of Spanish reporters, But I am not enjoyned to beleeve them. What is very observable and with warrant, I may.

I read also, that in the yeare of our Lord 1277, <HI>Myrangee</HI> an Atheist conquerd <HI>Narsinga</HI> and beyond this City, a man full of rapine and other impietie; yea so base∣ly opinionated of this relique and Tradition that havihg one yeare abun∣dance of ryce and other graine, and roome enough to hoord it in, in a con∣temning way and bravery no place would please him to put it save the holy Chappell, where prayers were incessantly made by many religious Christians. They intreat him to refraine, by all submissive meanes, but it spurs him on to a greater height of profanenesse, yea is infinitely glad it vexes them, by this supposing himselfe to be thought a God (a Devill ra∣ther) and to be worshipped. But see Gods power and favour in it; that night, in an affrighting dreame or vision he sees the old Apostle approach∣ing him in wrathfull and discontented way threatning to punish him for his ungodlinesse, and with an Iron whip proffers to lash the relenting King, who suddenly is a waked and as soone beseeching the Christians to pray for him, helping himselfe to purge the house of God and satisfying for his sacriledge.

<HEAD>Of Narsinga.</HEAD>
<P>NARSlNGA, is a Noble part of <HI>India</HI> where some would have <HI>Chormandell</HI> to terminate, but I like it not. <HI>Narsinga</HI> is famous all over <HI>Asia:</HI> confined by <HI>Mallabar, Gulcunda, Bengala</HI> (<HI>Baracura</HI> of old,) and the Ocean. The King so rich, that he despises his Neighbours: so powerfull in Men, Armes, and Ammunition; that hee values neither Mogul, Decan, Samoryn, nor Peguan. His Kingdomes are defended by loyall slaves, and many naturall advantages; full of all things requisite, for use, and plea∣sure: as faire Townes, strong Forts, pleasant fields, and choisest Mineralls; abounding in rivers, hills, dales, corne, cattell, fruit, &amp;c. so that with good cause he is reputed as absolute a Monark as any other in <HI>India.</HI> The Banny∣ans swarm like Locusts here; the Bramyns are no where more reputed of: the Temples indeed in their structures boast of no great bravery, but are proud within; reteyning many rich and massy Idolls, shaped and com∣manded by the Devil for his service and their devotion.</P>
<P>BISNAGAR (<HI>Modura</HI> of old, <HI>Arcati</HI> saies <HI>Castaldus</HI>) is the second Citie in <HI>Narsinga</HI> for grandeur and braverie; being circled with a wall of foure miles compasse, and as well fortefied: well built, and no lesse wealthy. Some Churches it has, remarkable for shape &amp; ornament; but in their gen∣tilisme base and immodest, yea unworthy the relation. The Port or Haven is good to anchor in: the Citie well frequented by European ships and Iunks from <HI>Malacca, Pegu, Cambogia, Cochyu-Chyna, Chyna, Iapan, Phyllip∣pinae,</HI> the <HI>Moluccae, Borneo, Iava, Sumatra, Zeiloon,</HI> and many parts of <HI>In∣dia, Arabia, Persia,</HI> and like places.</P>
<P>When any Traveller comes to his Court, he shall have fitting entertain∣ment: and is many times invited by the King, the better to shew his fine cloaths, which to shew ourselves thankfull we will report to other nati∣ons; being thick set with stones and gems of infinite valew and wonderfull lustre; which when he is roabed with (for the resemblance they have with the Son, which they worship) he is adored: his Court is full of Majesty, his guard being a thousand pensioners: he affects poligamy, and therefore writes himselfe husband of a thousand women; many of them having him all his life in such esteeme, that at his Death they make his flaming Grave their consuming Sepulcher.</P>
<P>MESVLIPATAN, commonly pronounc't by contraction <HI>Mestipa∣tan,</HI> is subject to the Gulcundan King, and removed from the Equinoctiall 16 degr. and a halfe, North; seated in the skirt of the <HI>Bengalan</HI> Ocean. The whole province admits a mixture of severall Idolatries; in most parts the <HI>Saracius</HI> and <HI>Bannyans</HI> being the greatest number. <HI>Mahomet</HI> was bla∣sted among them by a Colony of Persians conducted hither in the 28 yeare of the <HI>Aegyra</HI> and of our account 648 by <HI>Abdall Ben Hemyr</HI> a man of no smal reckoning with <HI>Ozman</HI> the then <HI>Calyph</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> &amp; <HI>Mecca,</HI> since when their off-spring have here inhabited. The town it selfe cannot be famosed either for bulk, beauty, or pleasure. 50 yeares agoe by a raging mortality

and Famin being well nigh depopulated. The streets are few, and narrow; the houses low and unfurnished; the fields and gardens parcht by flaming <HI>Phaeton,</HI> which here rages from March to Iuly; from thence to Novem∣ber the wind and raine as incessantly disturbing them: so as of twelve months, they have but foure from November to March salubrious and moderate: howbeit by reason of the English residence here, of late traf∣ficking for callicoes, rice, and the like, it begins to flourish, and is not to be doubted unlesse the unquiet and deceitfull humour of the people distaste the English and force their removall to adjacent places as <HI>Armagun</HI> and <HI>Polycat,</HI> where they may sit downe with more ease, lesse charge and choyser merchandizes.</P>
<P>Hence remove your chast eyes and eares to an unchast Towne, though <HI>Casta</HI> by name; a Towne infamous in cursed demonomy and wantonnesse. The Mosques have Idols in them, shewing art in sculpture very commen∣dable, but hatefull in the stinck of their devotion. The common shapes of Pagods here resemble beastly <HI>Priapus</HI> and <HI>Pan</HI> (as is described by <HI>Servius</HI> in <HI>Aegloc</HI> 2 <HI>Virgil</HI>) having great eyes, flat nose, wide mouth, foure great hornes, a long beard shaped like beames or radiance of he Sun, clawes for hands, and crooked legd, all over deformed.</P>
<P><HI>Nil sine Numine</HI> is old. Here we see <HI>Nil nisi Numen.</HI> The Devill pleasing them in varietie and not caring how nor in what shape it be, so he be ser∣ved. Some imagins a cow above all creatures worth his adoration. Others regard the Sunne, Moon, Starres, as heavenly soules and helpers: and other some the refreshing streames, shading trees, and the like; whereby I may fitly paralell them with what <HI>Tacitus</HI> speaks of the <HI>Celtes</HI> our neigh∣bours. <HI>Multa simulacra, multum peregrinae superstitionis vestigim ibi vi∣dere liceat.</HI> They have many solemne Festivalls. In some of them they fasten sick or needy-men (made stupid by too much zeale) to a hook or en∣gine, which being hoist to elevate him with the Pagod, the blood trick∣ling from his wounded shoulders <HI>(excessit medicina modum)</HI> is preserved by the Priest; &amp; at his discent (as a meritorious sacrifice) dasht against a Tree: and after he has (in most submissive sort) intreated the divell to accept his offring, returnes fild with joy and applause and hopes to thrive the better ever after. They Offer in the night, first making the streets bright as day by a multitude of lights, then stuffing their hands and bags with ryce, they glo∣merate and wind in dances; in every corner (wher a puppit-god sits) throw∣ing ryce and fruits; but being once out of the magick ring, haste away; not daring to looke back lest the Devill should teare them for this their gra∣titude.</P>
<P>They use not common burialls; in that the Carcaffe is placed in a deep cave, long and narrow; or betwixt two walls built so of purpose; and wherein the foolish widdow immures her self; never after speaking to any, but expecting death by the arrow of Famine, of all other the most formi∣dable and insufferable.</P>
<P>Their Habits are best part nakednesse, the zone excuses cloathing. They delight in fishing, and to sport upon the water, in boates or curricurries thus shaped.</P>

<P>PATANIA, (<HI>Perimula</HI> of old, at this day a well-known Citie in the <HI>Ben∣galan</HI> or <HI>Argaric</HI> gulph, and <HI>extra Gangem</HI>) elevates the Pole Artick, about 7 degrees; and is scituate in midst of those two famous Ports, <HI>Ma∣lacca</HI> and <HI>Syam.</HI> The government is Monarchicall; the Kings derive themselves from a Gentile King of <HI>Delly;</HI> who when he had subdued <HI>Pa∣tania,</HI> left his sonne <HI>Gingee</HI> his Prorex here; and from whom the late Queene and this Prince are truly branched. The Mogull oft threatens to dethrone him; yey he sits close and keeps his owne; especially safe∣guarded by interposing <HI>Ganges,</HI> and some small but usefull I'lets where he advantagiously fortefies. The Towne is strong, and best defended by 12 peeces of great brasse Ordnance; one of them (a Basilisco) is twenty six foot long, well proportioned in bore and squaring. Some Temples of Idolatry <HI>Patania</HI> shews, furnisht with wooden gods for politheisme; but more note-worthy in some antick Monumēts of former Kings.</P>
<P>The people are black, and go with the most part of their bodies naked: they take great delight in eating of Betle and Opium, and love Areck (or strong liquor) exceedingly: they usually eat in plates of gold. They fre∣quently speak three Languages, the <HI>Malay, Siam,</HI> and that of <HI>Chyna:</HI> Their writing differs, one which is the <HI>Malay,</HI> from the right hand to the left, as the Hebrews; another, which is the <HI>Syam,</HI> from the left to the right, as

we; a third, which is the <HI>China,</HI> right downe and bending no way: all three very usuall and affected by the industrious.</P>
<P>They are part Moores, and part Gentiles: the one so worship God; as the other do Pa-Gods or Idolls.</P>
<P>They are hospitable to such strangers as from desire of novely or gain, reside amongst them: neither do they enquire of what Countrie they be, what their Businesse, nor Religion. The men of note transcend in cur∣tesie; for at any mans arrivall, they blush not to proffer their Daugh∣ters or Neeces to be their bed-fellowes; yea to concomitate them at bed and board during his stay; the price for such a favour not equalling so high a complement: but that, were it lesse; too much in my opinion for such Pandars and base prostitutes. At the end of the prefixed time the woman returnes home well pleas'd; so far from shame or losse, that they rather accompt her honoured; and fit for preferment: But 'tis dangerous to be wanton elsewhere; jealousie on either side inflaming into rage, which seldome dyes without one or anothers destruction: I cannot but cry out upon them, and adjudge them in the civil sorrow of one of their Religion, but more temperance; who could sigh out, at sight of such absurdities, <HI>Oh miserum! cui peccare liceat.</HI> Adultery they punish rigidly; Fornication is more tollerable. The young women are carelesly frolick, and feare∣lesly merry; the married, melancholy and strictly observed: idlenesse and heat provokes them to inchastity. The men are also effeminate; yea wallow in all kind of turpitude and sensuality: their females are often in their sight; the grape commoves them to wickednesse; they delight their gust and pallat with choysest wines, waters, Rack, Ryce, and fruits, both succulent and restorative; and which make <HI>Venus</HI> predominate: but by this their intemperance they abreviate their dayes; few exceeding sixty yeeres: an old age, if you contemplate their lust (Deaths best harbinger,) and the Zone they sweat in; bad, both; both, intemperate.</P>

<P>SIAM, (calld <HI>Sobanna</HI> formerly; a Citie and Kingdome so denominated; declining North from the Aequinoctiall 14 deg.) is famous for power, wealth, and many sorts of excellencies: a great part of <HI>Pegu, Braama,</HI> and <HI>Cambogia</HI> are tributary to him; <HI>Patania</HI> also, <HI>Iamohay, Odjea,</HI> and many other Territories watered by <HI>Ganges</HI> acknowledge him: his power is great, usually warring with 1000 Elephants and, 200000 men. The Zone is hot, the men black, and in such torrid places, little cloathing is required: a Cambolin of pure lawn of a sad colour, trebled on and about their naked shoulders: some tye a leather skin about their neck; and (as a badge of de∣votion) gird their middles with a leathern thong, and hold a Sumbrero or Umbrella in their hands to lenefie the flaming Sun; but weare no Sandals, that the scorching sands may so mortifie, that the <HI>Tallapoi,</HI> may be thought a wonder.

But to see a Virgin here, at virgins yeeres, is as a black Swan, in regard, in green yeers they give the too forward maids a virulent drink; whose vertue (vyce rather) is by a strange efficacy to distend their muliebria so capaci∣ously that Bels and rope ring too too easily: and which is worst (dull memo∣ry compels us write it) the women here are not ashamed (the better to al∣lure men from sodomitry) to go naked to the middle, where with a fine trāsparent cobweb-lawn they are so covered, that by a base device tis made to open as they go; so that any impure ayre gives all to mens immodest viewes, denudating those parts, which every modest eye most scornes; each honest thought most hates to see and think upon. The Boyes paint them∣selves with a celestiall colour from top to toe, and as an augmentation of beauty, cut, gash, and pinck their naked skins; which in mine (contrary∣ing their) opinion, rather breeds horror than affectation in any Traveller; the men affect perfumes, and practize complement.</P>

<P>I have told you the best of <HI>Pegu;</HI> the worst is also memorable: In lesse than a hundred yeeres ago, the Peguan Monark was farre more powerfull and formidable than at this present: his Dyadem then sparkled with a gal∣lent lustre; twelve wealthy Kingdomes at that time acknowledged <HI>Pegu</HI> their Soveraigne: Some of those Provinces are well knowne to us, as <HI>Sy∣am, Auva, Kavelan, Barmaw, Iangomer, Tangram, Cablan, Lawran, Melio∣talk, &amp;c.</HI> out of which, hee yeerely extracted as tribute-money two Millions of crownes; and had a Million of men to serve him at all occasi∣ons; but this hardly could content him, for by a two losty conceit of his Monachick greatnesse; he grew efflated, and to contemne others as too base to fix his eyes upon; Tyranny succeeded his pride, and decadence or destruction of his Empire: Tyranny, for the Auvan King when he found no priviledge by being Uncle to the Emperour of <HI>Pegu,</HI> nor that he was his loyall subject; he swells with rage, and breaks asunder his silver yoak of hated servitude: howeit, ere hee could ripen his designes, the Peguan has notice, and so suddenly arrests him, that in amazement he acknowleges his fault, and begs his mercy: but the Peguan King forthwith beheads him, and (to terrifie others by his example) makes no difference 'twixt no∣cent and innocent; his wife, his children, and forty other whom he most respected concomitating the miserable Auvan King in that sad Tragedy. It was terrible Justice no doubt, but rather exasperated others to new re∣bellions; the most incenst and greatest in power was the Siam King, who seeing his owne incertaine standing, (any occasion breeding jealousie, and
<PB N="320" REF="165"/>
the least jealousie bringing death from his conquerour) hee suddenly breaks out, and with all the forces he could make by money or promises (ere the Peguan was return'd from <HI>Auva</HI>) in short time enters <HI>Pegu,</HI> and ap∣parantly made knowne his high rebellion: the Peguan threatens terrible things, and to effect them opposes the Siamite with an Armie of nine hun∣dred thousand fighting men; but that world of men could not contrarie the decree of a more powerfull King; for such was the confused haste he made, precipitated by furie, such the hate, his crueltie had defam'd him with, and such the affright his uncles <HI>Malus Genius</HI> (as <HI>Caesars</HI> did <HI>Brutus</HI>) every where opposed him with, that in three houres fight his monstrous multi∣tude turne raile and willingly yeeld themselves a prey to the inraged axe of war, chosing rather to dy, than any way to increase the Paguan's pride; so as the Siamite triumphs, &amp; the Peguan hastens back to raise more men to trie a second fortune: The Siamite (not willing to ingage himselfe too far) returnes; the Peguan is almost there as soone as he, all the way burning and destroying all he met with: the <HI>Siam</HI> King armes himselfe with the Foxes skin; he refused to fight, not that he feared, but that he knew an easier way whereby: to assure his conquest; the <HI>Pegu</HI> darts many fiery defiances, calls him rebell, coward, and what not; not dreaming of his stratagems: for ere hee could leave his trenches the swift and mighty river <HI>Suhan</HI> (<HI>Mean</HI> some call it) sweld desperately, broke ore her bancks, and flasht so violent into the <HI>Peguan</HI> army, that for want of boates and others helpes, above seven hundred thousand perished, the rest were as bad as dead; feare and famine so overwhelmed them; this river every yeere (like <HI>Nilus</HI>) over∣flowes, and supplies their want of raine; so mellowing the earth as it com∣pares with <HI>Aegypt</HI> for plenty, and with any other part of <HI>Indya</HI> for rarities: the next yeere the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> seconded his fight, but was compensated with no better fortune, we may say with worse; in that his sonne in this triall by too much valour lost his life, and of 500000 not a third got safe back to <HI>Martavan.</HI> And which was worse than that, by these perpetuall brawles of warre, his coffers were emptied; his Cities impoverisht by want of trade; and his Kingdome in a sort depopulated by losse of so many men: these prov'd not motives of pittie to the other late subjected Ter∣ritories, but provocatives rather to unsetter themselves (as <HI>Siam</HI>) had done from unnaturall thraldome; so that the King of <HI>Bramaw,</HI> the viceroy of <HI>Tangu,</HI> and of <HI>Rachan</HI> (a Province twixt <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Bengala</HI>) confederate; and whiles the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> was hatching more prodigies at <HI>Martavan,</HI> they steale into <HI>Pegu</HI> with a resolute Army, destroying such as the late famine had spared, but though they found few people, and lesse food, yet got they riches incredible; out of <HI>Pegu</HI> the Citie as much treasure as loaded 2000 Camells; and as a period of that designe not only made the wretched King crownlesse, but crowned their conquest with his life, his wife, and three sonnes sorrowfully accompaying him: <HI>Arrakan</HI> and the other two disagreeing about the spoyle, were beaten home by the Bramaan King; hee enjy'd it but a while, the Siamite entring so furi∣ously, that hee also packt home and left <HI>Syam</HI> the victorie; who since then, upon a marriage twixt one of the royall family of <HI>Pegu</HI> and his daugther, has quit his claime; and gives way to have both Citie and

<HEAD>Of Java major.</HEAD>
<P>IAVA the greater, is an Ile nigh the <HI>Bengalan</HI> Sea, declining seven (some observe nine) degr. 40 minutes towards the Antartick Pole from the Equinoctiall; and in the 120 degrees of longitude. From East to West it stretches one hundred and fifty leagues, or of english miles foure hundred and fifty; from North to South nintie leagues, or two hundred and seventie miles: the midland is for the most part mountainous and ill peopled; the marittim low, and populous: the first is windy, but conducing to health; the latter marish, and insalubrious.</P>
<P>It is full of small villages, and inhabitants: the sea coast (by reason of trade for pepper) has Townes well built, most wealthy, and best defend∣ed: upon the North side, and to the N.E. especially, are <HI>Bantam, Palam∣ban, Iackatra</HI> (new named <HI>Batavia</HI> by the Duch; but formerly <HI>Sunda-Ca∣lapa</HI> by the Inhabitants,) <HI>Iaparra, Tuban, Iortan, Greecy, Chyringin, Sere∣baya</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Bantam</HI> is under Antartick declination or latitude, 6 degr. 20 minutes, and of westerly variation 3 degrees: the biggest Citie in the Iland; ownd by the Natives, built well nigh two miles long, distinguisht into a Buzzar; the <HI>Pengrans</HI> Pallace, a few streets, and at the furthest end the Cheneses live together in low built dwellings. Of it selfe it affords nothing save ryce, pepper, and cotten woll: though indeed, pepper for the greatest part is brought hither by the crafty but infinitely industrious Chyney men, who each <HI>Ianuary</HI> anchor here, and unload their Iuncks or Prawes from <HI>Iamby, Borneo, Malacca,</HI> and diversother places; making <HI>Bantam</HI> their Maga∣zen or Beehive, out of which they furnish the English &amp; other merchants. These Chyneses are men of peace, voluptuous, venereous, costly in their sports, great gamesters, and in trading over subtle for young Chri∣stian merchants: oft-times they are so wedded to dicing, that after they have lost their whole estate, wife and Children are stak't and parted with; yet in little time by gleaning here and there, he will be able to redeeme them; if not, at the day, they are sold in the market.</P>
<P>The lavan Kings are five, (Viceroys I might better call them;) foure of them are subordinate to the <HI>Mattaran's</HI> command, who is able to bring unto the field 200000 desperate slaves, black, but valiant: they have small order or pollicy in warre; yet dare attempt any thing, they are so forward. The climate burnes so fiercely, that little apparell pleases them; most, goe most part naked: they use lances, darts, arrowes, and shields; but their sole braverie is in their crizes; a weapon, commonly two foot long, broad, waved, sharp edgd, and small pointed; but (against the lawes of Nature, and honour) basely poisoned: the hilt or handle is usually of wood or horne, (some have them of gold, silver, and Ivory) cut into the crooked shape or figure of a deformed Pagod; yet were they a thousand times more ugly, these savages would dare to adore them; especially, in that they aske the Idoll on their creast pardon, after they have perpetrated homycide or such like villany; a trick us'd by <HI>Lewes</HI>

But these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avans are drunck in their demonomy; they the more earnestly imbrace it, by how much their poysoned natures abhorre honesty. They trade in murthers, adulterie, thests, rapine, deceit, and all kinds of knave∣ries: Magique also, and Astrologie delights them: a study their Priests are execellent in, and in which Satan instructs them; the better to oblige their gratitude, and to worship him as the <HI>Apollo</HI> of knowledge; which wee inculcate, and abominate, yea say with <HI>Isaiah, Is there any God be∣sides the Lord (Iehovah)? yea, there is no God, we know not any:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. <HI>44.</HI></NOTE> <HI>hee maketh the diviners mad, hee turneth the wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish.

But in the Lord shall all true beleevers bee justified and shall glory.</HI></P>
<P>These people know better how to swim than navigate; yet are not ig∣norant in sea affaires, nor want they vessels to doe mischiefe in. Their chiefe delight is hunting Tygres, Ounces, and such beasts as give chase and resistance; They know <HI>Mahomet</HI> in some parts of the Ile, who as an infectious ayre is suckt by many people of remote Ilands. Friendly they are to English men and delight to serve them, especially since the Duch forced <HI>Iacatra</HI> from them, betwixt whom is such mortall vari∣ance that fifteen ryalls (is given by either) as a reward for each prisoner dead or alive, either people can take nor is there ever hope of true Amity with Barbarians. The Oran-kays or best sort of people here, are lasie, sociable, but not to bee too much trusted: they suppose them∣selves descended from <HI>Chyna;</HI> in a Iunck 700 yeares ago forced hither by Tuffon or tempest. They are proud, and weare their hayre pretty long, and about their crispes wreath a valuable Shash or Tulipant; go naked to to the wast, where they gird them with a parti-coloured plad or mantle, falling no longer than the knees; and are impatient if any of∣fer to touch their heads. The ordinary food had here (not at easie rates) is ryce, wheat, pinange, betele, ophium, goates, egs, hens, coquos, plaintains, jacks, and rack-a-pee so cald <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; which drunck immo∣derately, accilerates Death; but temperately, exhilirates the heart, cures fluxes, kill wormes and helps digestion. To conclude.</P>
<P>Whence this great and noble Ile is called <HI>Iava,</HI> I confesse my ignorance. I dare not say from <HI>Iavan</HI> (<HI>Iaphets</HI> sonne) grandson of <HI>Noah;</HI> in that most agree, he planted <HI>Greece.</HI> But by reason his own brother <HI>Tharsis</HI> peopled these parts, why might he not from his brothers name (to eternize his me∣mory) borrow the denomination. Nothing else save Pepper presents it∣selfe in this Ile, worthy our nothing: Pepper is sowne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepper.</NOTE> and in the growth supported by poles or canes, about which it entwines and duplicates with many embraces, till by maturity it gets the shape and strength of a bushy, round, and pleasant tree. The pepper hangs foure inches in length, and one about, in many clusters; each yeelding fifty or sixtie cornes, full, round and fragrant; the smooth is best accounted of.</P>
<P>The Cotton (more common in <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Guzurat</HI>) is no lesse memo∣rable and usefull. The tree is slender, streight, a yard high, and like a bryer;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cotter.</NOTE>
<PB N="326" REF="168"/>
at the top it expands into many severall branches; each, charg'd with ma∣ny balls or cods conteining the Bumbast or Cotton: the shape is round, and equall in bignesse to a Walnut: at maturity the cod opens, &amp; discloses her treasure; but being cropt, is put in an entire heap, and with flayles or such like usefull (though churlish) instruments is forced out; and by the enriched owner cheerefully gathered.</P>
<P>The Malayan Tongue sounds well, and may prove harmony to the in∣genious observer; in these parts no lesse musicall &amp; epedemic, than is (with us, and others) the Latine, Arabique, and Sclavonian.</P>

<P>CELEBES, by some is cald <HI>Makasser</HI> Ile, from her best Citie so cal∣led: a place for quantitie and quality no way despicable; stretching from the Equator 6 degrees South: ovall formed, two hundred miles long at lest; well peopled, but with bad people; no place ingendring greater Demonomists, well agreeing with the old name <HI>Ptol.</HI> gave them <HI>Anthro∣pophagorum regio. Mahomet</HI> is not unknowne among them, but by him, <HI>a malo in pejus:</HI> for though he teach them, there is one and but one God; yet seeing Iesus Christ is unknowne there, what does this their know∣ledge, but make them more capable of torment, than if they had been far more barbarous. From <HI>Macasser</HI> to <HI>Cambyna</HI> W. N. W. are foure and twentie leagues; to <HI>Nossaseres</HI> eightie.</P>
<P>The Ile is fruitfull, though under the most frying part of the burning Zone. The Son yeelds them day and heat enough; but Night, their com∣plexion: the habit they weare, differs not from their grandfather <HI>Adams,</HI> a few fig or plaintan leaves tide about their middles, being elsewhere naked: the better sort (to varie from the vulgar) are tulipanted, and shirt their coleblack skins with a pure white cloth, which does not leni∣fie the scortching sonne, but serves for complementall difference. The women are Gods creatures, but have adulterated his holy stampe, by not only deforming their face and body, but by that vile lubricitie, their soules are spotted with. Impudence goes here unmasked: It is no novel∣tie for them to open the sack they goe in, and intice a stranger to conco∣mitate; her honesty was lost before, but now she ferries two to <HI>Bara∣thrum:</HI> if his body (by that voyage) leak not to death, the Tobacco she proffers him will operate it; for such is their damned Art in horrid venom, that these Syrens can sing safety to themselves, and by the same pipe and weed smoak him to death; a trick they will be perfect in, though the Di∣vell owne them for it. <HI>Pythagoras</HI> made the wantons of <HI>Crotona</HI> modest and the men moderate: <HI>lam qui corrigat, alter erit.</HI> And which is no lesse infernall; the men use long canes or truncks (cald Sempitans) out of which they can (&amp; use it) blow a little pricking quill, which if it draw the lest drop of blood from any part of the body, it makes him (though the strongest man living) die immediately; some venoms operate in an houre, others in a moment; the veynes and body (by the virulencie of that poyson) cor∣rupting and rotting presently, to any mans terrour and amazement, and feare to live where such abominations predominate. You cannot chuse but think this a hell upon earth, though at our first approach upon sight of so goodly an Iland, we thought it better than <HI>Elysium:</HI> but remembring

South 20 min. easterly from the last: both of them more rich in stones and spices than some greater Iles about them: leave we also <HI>Conio</HI> and <HI>Serran</HI> unspoken of; not that they are unworthy, but because we hast to the <HI>Moluccae,</HI> in view now, and where wee meane to rest a while.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Molucco Jles.</HEAD>
<P>THey are numbred five. <HI>Molucco. Gillolo. Ternate. Tidore.</HI> and <HI>Ma∣chan</HI> (where <HI>Magellan</HI> after his long voyage <HI>Anno</HI> 1520 lost his life by treachery of these barbarians.) The English were the first that ever trad∣ed to these Iles of any Christians: and most of them have acknowledg'd our King their Sovereigne: but by the Duch it seemes our men are now thrust out, as if all <HI>India</HI> were theirs by title from the Creation.</P>
<P>Of these <HI>Gillolo</HI> is greatest; but in Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs, Ginger, Pepper, Oyle, Aloes, and Honey, all of them alike plentifull. All or most of these, have the Equinoctiall for their Zenyth, and by those diurnall showres, and breezes which faile them not, and <HI>Apolloes</HI> commorance, the the fruits ripen sooner, the earth smells more aromaticall, and the Ayre seemes more nutritive than in other places. Let us rest a little upon some fruit descriptions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloves.</NOTE>The Clove tree differs in proportion according to the place it receives vigor in: some being comparable to the Bay, others to Box or such like trees of humble stature; 'tis, most part of the yeere green and pleasant, having leaves long and small, distending into many branches: It blossmes early, and becomes exceeding inconstant in complexion; from a virgin white palliating other colours: in the morne a pale green, in the meridian a distempered red, &amp; sleepes in blacknesse. The Cloves manifest themselves at the utmost end of all the branches in great plenty; and in their grow∣ing evaporate such sense ravishing odours, as if a compendium of Natures sweetest gums and delicacies were extracted and here uunited: they are thrice yeerly pruined, and gratefully retort a treble vintage: and though but perfected in 3 yeares, yet must be counted an advantage; for Physiti∣ans tell us, they are hot and drie in the third degree, corroborate the sto∣mack, and benefit concoction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nutmeg.</NOTE>The Nutmegg (or great Nut) like those trees most famous for their ex∣ellencies, is not very lofty in its heigth, scarce so proper as the Cherrie; by some, resembled to the Peach, with which it varies in forme of leafe and graine, affecting more assize and compasse. The Nut is cloathed with a defensive husk like those of baser quality, but at full ripenesse disroabs it selfe, and discovers her naked purity the Mace, which chastely intwines (with a vermilliion blush or colour) her endeared fruit and sister, both of them breathing out most pleasing smells and perfumes: the Mace in few dayes (like choisest beauties) by <HI>Apolloes</HI> wanton flames becom's tawny and unlike her former braverie: yet in that dissent, best pleases the rustick gatherer.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="170"/>Neere the <HI>Molucco's,</HI> and neerer the Antartique, wee see many other Iles, noble in esteeme, and rich in qualitie: but, for that more than bar∣barous basenesse our miserable Country-men suffered by the Dutch, we have no pleasure to stand upon any thing save recitall; such are <HI>Amboyna,</HI> (placed 'twixt <HI>Banda</HI> and <HI>Molucso:</HI>) <HI>Banda,</HI> (in 4, degrees 30 minutes, and (from <HI>Amboyna</HI> 24 leagues:) <HI>Puloway,</HI> (from <HI>Banda</HI> 3 leagues:) <HI>Puloreen,</HI> (from <HI>Puloway</HI> W.N.W.) <HI>Lantore,</HI> (the greatest of the Iles of <HI>Banda:</HI>) <HI>Ba∣tan: Labatacka, Nero, Ticobassa, Cumber, Salame,</HI> and others: all of them, especially <HI>Puloway</HI> and <HI>Puloreen,</HI> seeming continued wildernesses of Nut∣megs and Clove-trees, Pepper, Vines, and Olives. These two last named commerced first with our Merchants, and contracted a perpetuall Amity and Fealty to our King; but in despight of them and us, the uncivill Dutch (whom for their braving humours here, pride, hate, and bloody execu∣tion of our innocent men at <HI>Amboyna</HI> and other places in <HI>India,</HI> I cannot name with patience) have banisht our Merchants, and entitle themselves Lords of most of <HI>Banda</HI> Ilands, caring neither what right the Tarnatensian nor <HI>Banda</HI> Kings have over them.</P>

<HEAD>Of Borneo.</HEAD>
<P>BORNEO, or <HI>insula bonae fortunoe</HI> in <HI>Ptol.</HI> is Nadyr to the Aequator; and resembles an ovall shield; the major part inclining North: Antartick elevation not mounting above 3 degrees; Artick, to 7 and odde minutes: &amp; owes her first discovery (by any Christian European) to one <HI>de Bren,</HI> who in the yeere of our blessed Lord 1523. anchored here. It groanes at this day, (for the most part) under Spanish bondage; who in any place where gold or other treasure is to bee had, cease not till they can master it; va∣lewing neither soule nor body of any Inhabitant, (save for their lust) with the least weight of that too much soule-confounding creature. But let us consider! <HI>Nulla Coelum reparabile gaza.</HI></P>
<P>It has many Villages and people; but the one are poore in their ma∣teriall; the other more wretched in their infernall Religion, and late taught Idolatry: both, no way valewable; did not those mynes of Gold and Dyamonds, and some other merchandises; as, Bezarrs, Musk, Am∣ber, Lignum Aloes, Sanguis Draconûm, Wax, Rice, and Rattans or Canes make her most magneticall. Her marittim Townes and Ports exceed not for number, but <HI>Peu &amp; bon. Socodania,</HI> (in 1 deg. 35 minutes South, from <HI>Bantam</HI> N. E. 160 leagues) and <HI>Bemermassin;</HI> Little, but good, if such thou interpret. Safety and Satiety.</P>
<P>We are landed in so good a place, that wee will rest our wearied feet awhile, and entertaine your curiosity with a few viands; friends (though simple food) to infeobled Nature. Bezar, Lignum Aloes, Musk, Civit, Benjamin, and Amber.</P>
<P><HI>Bezar,</HI> or (as the Persians call it) <HI>Pezar,</HI> is of two sorts; generated in <HI>Persia</HI> and both the Indyes: the American is worse than be these of <HI>Asia</HI> and the Orient. The shape also is various; some resembling a plum, some
<PB N="332" REF="171"/>
a Date-stone, others like Egges of Doves, some like Cheznuts, and Goats kidnies; all agree in this, they are blunt ended: they are no lesse incon∣stant and divers in colour; some being red, pale-greene some, other-some of a dark yellow, and some sky-coloured: the last are best, these consist∣ing of many skales (like Unions and Onions) circumvolving one the other, and in which. Nature has exprest farre more excellency, than Arts best in∣genuity or perfection: for, each inferior skale (not unlike the glorious Orbes inverted) yeelds fresher beauty, and more celestiall splendor than the former: each skale diminishing &amp; being of more vertue, as the Bezar is in tenuity or crassitude. Many are counterfeit. They try them thus, either by pearcing them with hot bodkins; or after they have wayd them, to steep them in cold water foure houres; and if it crack not, tis not feyned: to know it good, they then, wipe it, and ballance it againe; observing, if it weigh never so little above the first weight, 'tis base and despicable. Note also, that <HI>Borneo</HI> Bezars are not halfe so valewable as <HI>Persia's.</HI></P>
<P>Lignum Aloes, from diversity of Countries, varie in their Nomenclati∣ons. The Javans and Malayans name it, Garroo: Indians and Portuguizes, D' Aquillha, the Chinae, and Cochinchinae, Calamba: fram'd of large round sticks, of a cloody graine, commixt with ashy veines; no lesse pleasant to the eye, than to the hand ponderous: the relish or taste proves bitter, in its language telling you, It would be burned; for, hot coales of Fyre no sooner touch it, but it incendiates, and (to the honour of its owne Fune∣rall solemnity) expires and breaths out an odor so aromatick and comfor∣able, that no other is used by the Indians, Malayans, Siamites, Peguans; Cambogians, and Borneans, when they incinerate the Carcasses of their most honoured Parents.</P>
<P>Musk, is either yellow, browne, or black: the first is best, last is basest: the choysest yellow shews a deep Amber complection (not unlike Spike∣nard) cloathed with a reasonable moist skin, sweating out some bristly hayres, without stones, lead, or like adulterate mixtures; of so strong a smell as seemes offensive; but tasted, penetrates a strong braine by its fra∣gor: sweet spices dead it; and put in the mouth, if it suddenly dissolve, or in the hand if it be long a melting; those trialls discover it for bad and imperfect.</P>
<P>Civit, is diversified in colour also: deep yellow (I have beene told) is best, the worst is white, gerasie and sophisticat: how beit, the new is pale, and soone after groweth yellowish.</P>
<P>Benjamin, by the Malayans call'd Menyan; by other Indians Benyan: is either pure cleare white, or yellow, streaked or coloured; the gum issues from a tree high, small, and furnished with fruitlesse branches; the leaves are not unlike the Olive: <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Siam</HI> yeelds the best; <HI>Arabia</HI> very good; that from <HI>Sumatra, Priaman</HI> and <HI>Barrouse,</HI> course, and had: better lik'd of at <HI>Iava,</HI> than in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Amber, is of so many formes; grey, browne, white, black: grey is best; black is worst; the other two are indifferent. The best sort of grey is pure, interlac't with ashie veines, not subject to sinck; and got (as Mer∣chants informe us) in <HI>Soffala, Magadoxa, Mombassa, Mosambique, Madagas∣car Mohelia, Melinde,</HI> other parts of <HI>Afrique:</HI> found there at incertain

We have Corrall, Amber, Emrald, Calcedon, Pearle, Onix, Sardonix, Sardis, Bezar, Hematist, and Turquoise from <HI>Arabia. Indostan,</HI> and <HI>Persia:</HI> Pearles, Berills, Saphyres, and Adamants from <HI>Zeyloon:</HI> Jasper, Cornelion, Agat, Heliotrope, Jacinth, and Chrysolite from <HI>Mallabar, Narsinga,</HI> and <HI>Cochin-chyna.</HI> Diamonds from <HI>Borneo,</HI> and <HI>Gulkundah:</HI> Gold, Silver, Rubies, Saphyre, Granats, Topaz, Emrald, Smargd, Espinells, Cats-eyes, and Porcellan, from <HI>Pegu, Siam, Bengala, Sumatra, Iapan,</HI> and <HI>Chyna:</HI> enough to make a poore man rich, and rich men miserable.</P>
<P>Let us now to Sea againe, and by a N. N. E. course in few houres view <HI>Mindanao,</HI> an Ile (as big as <HI>Cicely</HI>) branching from 6, to above 9 degrees North. North of it, and neighbouring, are the Phillippinae, so named from King <HI>Phillip 2,</HI> by <HI>Lopez, de Legaspi</HI> who first discovered and planted there <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1565. Iles for the greatest part namelesse and number∣lesse; all of them wounded by avaritious men, and branded under Spanish servitude: of these, the best and greatest in <HI>Luconia,</HI> under 14 degrees North latitude; from whence in a direct azumoth West, is <HI>Cambogia</HI> a rich part of the Asiatique Continent. North of <HI>Luconiae,</HI> are <HI>Shyma</HI> and <HI>Shycoca</HI> knowne(by costly neighbourhood) to <HI>Chyna</HI> and <HI>Iapan,</HI> as is <HI>Co∣rea</HI> also; a long narrow peninsule, famous in the scite, but infamous in her Pagan inhabitants; said to bee more subtle, cruell, and indomitable than be the Chyneses.</P>

<P>IAPAN, unlesse <HI>Mercators</HI> fancie be true that it was <HI>Aurea Chersonesus,</HI> was questionlesse unknowne to old Geographers: howbeit, the Name <HI>Chryse</HI> is given it by <HI>Niger; Zipangri,</HI> by <HI>M.

<P>The primier discovery wee give to <HI>Motus, Peshotus,</HI> and <HI>Zeymorus,</HI> ba∣nisht Portugals; who in the yeere 1542. were cast upon this Ile by storm and accident. Whether it bee an Ile or no, is disputable: such as make it one, give it in length 600, in bredth, 190 miles English: for my part, I hold it questionable. The most Southerly part is removed from the line 32 deg. the best Townes and Ports of strength and trade are <HI>Meacco, Ozacca, Tenze, Fyrando, Fuccate</HI> (or <HI>Falcate</HI>) <HI>Sacay, Cratez, Tenkeday, Oringaw, Vo∣suquis, Machma, &amp;c.</HI> Of these, <HI>Meacco</HI> (a mediterran City) is call'd the Me∣troplis, <HI>Surunga</HI> next, and next it <HI>Ozacca,</HI> honoured with the Court som∣times till of late <HI>viz.</HI> 1615. a rebellious fire subverted and incinerated not it only, but many other Townes in that wealthy Province. <HI>Meacco</HI> is as big as <HI>Florence,</HI> but not so beautifull: proud in a sweet and spatious river, in many low, but comly houses; and memorable in abundance of stately Temples or Fotiquees full of guilded Mannad'as or Idolls; to which (above all other Nations) the Japonians are most addicted; the Jesuits
<PB N="334" REF="172"/>
industries &amp; seminaries there producing small growth; instead of a happy harvest reaping scorne and catholique apostasre: Neither their grave as∣pect, nor subtte sophistry; neither their many miracles there, nor their collegiat bravery, having that force to make them thought other than fe∣ditious, vain-glorious, and avaricious: such is the reward of Hipocrisie; in shew seeming desirous to do others good, in truth ayming at their uni∣versality, gaine, and hope of Conquest.</P>
<P>The government is Monarchicall: above threescore petty Kings do ho∣mage, and prostrate their massy Coronets to be encircled, and to illustrate the Emperiall Diadem; from whose frowne, a punishment and affliction worse than common death usually is darted: such is his power, his awe; such their vassalage, their opinion of their Governors. The Country is most part mountanous; but full of floods, trees, corne, grasse, and mine∣ralls: every way presents Villages, swarming with heithen Inhabitants: the North and East parts of <HI>Iapan</HI> are lesse peopled than the South and West; and those much more savage and barbarous; cruell, trecherous, idle, lascivious, and awed by no Law, nor any way industrious. The old Roman way of execution is here usually suffered; they fasten malefactors to Crosses with foure nailes; whether in hate to the Jesuits, or of Antique custome I am not certaine; but sure it is, the punishment is full of torture and ignominious: the Civill Japonians are vallant, curteous, complemen∣tall, and great affectors of novelties; but beyond measure jealous, crafty, and revengefull, if injured; yea divelish, if exasperated. They would, but cannot deny themselves discended out of <HI>China,</HI> banisht upon a heedlesse rebellion six hundred yeeres ago; in memory of which, they hate one another mortally, no quarter being given to either Nation at any time, nor cease the Ilanders to rob and piratize the Chyneses at all advantages; at home also in their prayers abhominating them, and in all complements and ceremonies varying from one another to expatiate their wrath and unnaturall distempers. In any slight suspect or accusation, the very chil∣dren are so jealous of their reputations, that in case you lose a trifle and say to one of them; syrrah I beleeve you have stolen it? without any pause the boy will immediatly cut off a joynt from one finger or ano∣ther; and say Sir, if you say true, I wish my finger may never heale againe: murder, theft, treason, and adultery, are punisht with death; either cru∣cified, or beheadded with a Cuttan; an Indian sword which slices easily.</P>
<P>Towns of note and strength are <HI>Ozacca</HI> (80 leagues from <HI>Bungo</HI>) a Port Towne of good note, and neare the Sea; strong and beautifull: in no∣thing more famous nor observable than in the royall Castle, varnished, ty∣led, and burnisht over with flaming gold; rich and majesticall: form'd of the best shape, of excellent stone; the walls, every where twenty foot thick, finely fram'd, well polisht, curiously cemented, pleasant, and du∣rable: circled with deep trenches full of water; and for entrance and de∣fence shewes above a dozen iron Gatest, and drawing Bridges.</P>
<P>It has formerly succoured many Kings, and secur'd them from the pur∣suit and heat of Rebels; in this as memorable, 'twas of late yeeres made the prison of <HI>Goja-zamma</HI> Prince of <HI>Tanzey</HI> and eldest Sonne of <HI>Tiquazamma</HI> the late victorious Emperour; whose Father <HI>Faxiba-zamma</HI> subjected all
<PB N="335" REF="172"/>
the petty Princes of <HI>Iapan;</HI> and made them by oath and pledge agnise him and his their Soveraignes: <HI>Coja-zamma</HI> upon his Fathers sudden death was as suddenly seiz'd upon by <HI>Ogosho-zamma</HI> one of the three Protectors, and by him compelled to betroath his daughter; and for portion was if thrust, and for ever damned to this hatefull Prison. Against <HI>Ozacca,</HI> on the other side the river is seated <HI>Sucay</HI> a Towne well traded to by Christians: <HI>Edoo</HI> is well wall'd and peopled: 15 leagues thence is <HI>Oringoo</HI> a Towne af∣fording good refreshment and excellent harbouring or anchorage. <HI>Fy∣rando</HI> (300 leagues thence, to coast thither,) is a Chersonesse and elevates the Artick Pole 33 degrees, 30 minutes: var. East 2 degrees 50 minutes: where and at <HI>Fuccate</HI> the English had a residence or factory.</P>
<P><HI>Fucate</HI> or <HI>Fulcate</HI> is pretty sweet Towne, well watered, and ownes a strong and defensive Castle or Fortresse: a Forrest of loftie Pines and spreading Sycomores for three miles space environs it; with other Groves of force against the scorching Sun; delightfull to the eye, yea more grate∣full than any other object: but (which renders them ingrate and basely idolatrous) under those greene trees, and in many small but richly tyl'd Temples or Fotiques, they adore <HI>Pan</HI> and <HI>Priapus,</HI> yea Satan himselfe in his ugliest resemblances: for where the Country is most inhabited and garnisht with most variety of trees, grasse, corne, &amp;c. (as, 'twixt <HI>Edoo</HI> and <HI>Suringa</HI>) there are erected most Fotiques, there the people are most idolatrous.</P>
<P>In <HI>Meacco</HI> are 70 Temples, wherein they number 3333 Chamaetirae or little guilded Devils, to which they give divine respect: they call them <HI>Mannadaes:</HI> But more notable than the rest is that in <HI>Meacco;</HI> not unlike the Rhodyan Colossus, huge &amp; wonderfull. This was built by <HI>Tyco-zamma,</HI> and without much paine and cost was not finished: 'tis of Oricalke or guilded Copper; its posture is fitting in a Chaire 70 foot high, and 80 broad: his head is capable to support fifteene men, who may stand toge∣ther without preasing: his thumb is forty inches about; and his other limbs proportionable. This is the grand <HI>Pagotha:</HI> the other are <HI>Dii mi∣nores,</HI> or of lesse adoration. No lesse notable is the Monument adjoyning, in a Cloister within the principall Fotique of <HI>Meacco,</HI> where are gallantly interred (but to their ignominie) the eares &amp; noses of 3000 Coreans, a base, theevish people, vicinating &amp; infesting the Japonians. At <HI>Dabys</HI> is another Mannada no lesse infamous and resorted to: this Devill (or Molech) is of concave copper, vast, thick, and double guilded: its height is foure and twenty foot, and would be more but that they have form'd it kneeling, his buttocks resting upon his leggs after the usuall mode of the Easterne Pa∣gans: his armes are safe stretcht to the utmost; and at solemne times is inflam'd within, and sacrific'd unto by offering him a child, which in's embraces is fride to death in an infernall torture. But of more note is another at <HI>Ten∣chedy</HI> East thence, where Sathan visibly playes th'Impostor. The Fo∣tique is of rare structure, and daily served by a multitude of hellish Priests or Bonzees; not admitted to attend there, except they be young, well shap't, and as strong in venerie as was <HI>Hercules,</HI> Every new Moon they so∣lemnly betroth unto the Devill a Damosell, whose Parents account the ceremonie happie and honourable: if any be more faire or singular than

another, shee is selected, by the lustfull Priests devoted, and brought into the Temple, and placed right against the Mamada or Idoll: the roome is first made glorious with Lamps of burnisht gold, and a preparation by in∣cendiating <HI>Lignum vitae,</HI> or other gums and perfumes, such as be curious and costly: by and by the Lamps extinguish by myracle, and in a grosse darknesse the Prince of darknesse approaches and abuses her; so shee imagines, and the rather credited, in that the Devill leaves behind him certaine scales like those of fishes, an argument of no phantasma: but, by this hellish conjunction they swell not, unlesse the Bonzee second it: Sa∣than is no sooner gone, but she is saluted by the Bonzees, who ravish her with songs and pleasant musique; which ended, shee acquaints them with her fortune, and resolves them in such questions, as she by their instruction propounded to the Devill, and he had satisfied her in: shee issues with ap∣plause, and ever after is reputed holy and honourable: many other things I could present you from tradition, but I avoyd (as much as may be) to in∣sert incertainties: from hence therefore faile wee West and land in <HI>Chyna,</HI> where though the travaile be difficult, yet suffer me to glean a little, though it but expresse my industrie and care to offer you the truest Novelties.</P>

<P>CHINA, is the most Easterly part of <HI>Asia.</HI> A Kingdome, both great and wealthie: famous also, but scarce discovered. Their jealousie and discourtesie to strangers (they suffer any to enter, none to returne,) chiefly causes it.</P>
<P>It is subject to many severall names: scarce any two strange people ac∣cord in one Nomenclation: and no wonder, since amongst themselves they affect variety: the Kings new naming the whole Kingdome at their Coronation, as they fancie it.</P>
<P><HI>Ptolomy</HI> long agoe call'd it <HI>Sinarum Regio:</HI> other Geographers, <HI>Seres:</HI> the Moores in <HI>Industant,</HI> call it <HI>Cathayo:</HI> the Arabians, <HI>T'synin:</HI> the Sya∣mites, <HI>Cyn:</HI> the Malayans, <HI>Tabenzo:</HI> the Japonites, <HI>Thau,</HI> and <HI>T'syn:</HI> the Tattarrs, <HI>Ham: Alhacen, Tangis: Paulus Venetus, Mangi:</HI> the Inhabitants (if <HI>Perera, Riccius,</HI> and <HI>Trigautius</HI> say true) <HI>Tamen;</HI> and themselves <HI>Tame∣gines.</HI> But how various soe're that be; this is not uncertaine: that it is a very spatious Monarchie: for it extends from 17 deg. to 43, of North La∣titude: and to the South, <HI>Cantam;</HI> to the North, <HI>Pequin;</HI> two royall Ci∣ties, seeme to terminate it. But thus confined: On the East, it has the Sea of <HI>Iapan</HI> (<HI>Corea</HI> is part of <HI>China,</HI> no Ile, but to the North conjoyned with the Continent:) On the West, the Desarts of <HI>Industant;</HI> On the North, the Tattars: On the South, the <HI>Phillipinae</HI> Iles; and the South West ad∣joyneth to <HI>Cochyn-China,</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> with part of <HI>Siam.</HI> All agree that it is square; and that from any one side to another is 1500 English miles: the circuit above 4000. the Country is generally champaign, &amp; fruitfull; full of sweet and navigable rivers; and which are no lesse inhabited than the Villages and Cities be: of which, <HI>China</HI> has no fewer than 600 Cities; 2000 wall'd Townes; 4000 unwalled; 1000 Castles; and of Villages scarce to be numbred: and many they had need to be, since they give
<PB N="337" REF="173"/>
lodging to above threescore millions of men and boyes, besides women; which be not inrolled. The whole Empire is divided into fifteene great Provinces: governed by so many Quon-fu and Lausia; who have their Tutans, and Chyans, or Deputies under them. Each of those Provinces has a Metropolis: full of people; fairely built; and very spatious. But every way more excellent than the rest, are these foure, <HI>Paquin</HI> by some called <HI>Pasquin: Nanquin</HI> or <HI>Nanton: Cantam</HI> or <HI>Canton:</HI> and <HI>Quinsay,</HI> by them called <HI>Ham-ceu:</HI> of which foure, at this day <HI>Paquin</HI> is chiefe or Em∣periall.</P>
<P>PAQVIN elevates the North Pole 41 degr. 15 minutes; and by late Geographers is accounted that same Citie which some call <HI>Cambalu</HI> water∣ed by <HI>Polisanga;</HI> and <HI>China</HI> then must bee <HI>Cathaya:</HI> yea (if <HI>Pantoja,</HI> and <HI>Di Canti</HI> say true) the <HI>Chyna</HI> Monarch is that same great <HI>Cam,</HI> which <HI>M. P. Ve∣netus</HI> and <HI>Mandevile</HI> afore him have famoused. The Citie <HI>Pequin</HI> is que∣stionlesse the most spatious, and best peopled in <HI>Asia,</HI> if not in the world: since it has 30 Duch leagues (ninety English miles) circumference: it includes many stately buildings; and Mausoleas; 24000 are numbered of the Mandarins Sepulchers; the meanest of which, is not without beauty: and a no lesse number of little guilded Chappells, beside 3800 Temples devoted to Idolatry. It has as many Gates &amp; Posterns as be dayes in a yeer: sixscore Buzzars or Market-places: above a thousand Bridges of stone: and such water as is every where potable. This City is not above a hundred miles from that marvellous wall, which <HI>Crisnagol</HI> their King (<HI>Zaintzon</HI> the 117 King some say) built 1000 yeeres ago, to keep out the invading Tartarr: a wall 1200 miles long; six fathoms high; twelve yards thick; and such as was seven and twenty yeeres erecting, by a continued labour of 750000 men.</P>
<P>NANQVIN (the second Citie for grandeur and bravery, till of late,) was the <HI>China</HI> Metropolis. It elevates the Artick Pole 32 degr. and is di∣stant from the Sea 8 leagues or there abouts. The City is 12 leagues a∣bout; circled with three strong walls and ditches: the Kings Pallace is glorious and vast; the other buildings many (for 200000 are reckned) but meanly beautifull: the Temples are above a thousand: the streets fayre; the people industrious: from <HI>Paquin</HI> removed East, six hundred miles English: most part of the way is navigable.</P>
<P>CANTAM is at the South end of <HI>China,</HI> in 17 deg. a Towne both rich and spatious: our Ships came almost in view of it: from it to <HI>Paquin</HI> is two months travell.</P>
<P>QVINZAY or <HI>Ham-ceu</HI> borders <HI>Cochin-China:</HI> of old, the greatest, at this day the most admirable for variety of antick rarities in the Orient.</P>
<P>These bee the most noted, but many other great and populous Cities this great Empire conteineth: generally of one shape and alike governed: None be without their Meani or Temples fild with Deastri or Idols. The Countrey is generally champaign and fruitfull; the husbandmans care and paines make it to fructifie and repay its thanks in various tribute: each Pro∣vince there is well watered: and few of those rivers but abound in fish, which the Chyneses not only banquet on, but on Frogs, Snakes, Rats, Dogs, Hogs, and such food as many other Nations abhominate: they fish with Cormorants.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="174"/>The people are Olive coloured; more black or white as they vary from the Aequinoctiall: they weare their haire very long, and fillited; their eyes are commonly black; their noses little; their eyes small; their beards deformedly thin; and nailes often times as long as their fingers, serving as a mark to distinguish the Gentry by. The better sort are habited in silke and a sleight sort of satten; the meaner, in black cloth made of cotton: their coats or vests are long and quilted; made to tye under the left arme after the usuall garb of <HI>Asia;</HI> their sleeves are also very long, and at the wrist very strait: their shoes are many times of such stuffe as bee their coats; and soaled with cloth or callicoes: some have them richly imbroy∣dered. The greatest variety amongst them is in their head attire: some knit their hayre in cawles of silk, of horse-hayre some, and some with fillets of gold or silver: others weare high caps or felts made of fine twigs, round, and commixt with silk of divers colours; and other-some an antick sort of hat, high crown'd, round, one halfe without brim, and tawny coloured. The women are commonly modest, and differ not in ap∣parell; in that a like vaile of white linnen wholly couers them; shewing nothing but their polt-feet, which from their infancy are straitned; so as to make them alla mode, many of them are maymed.</P>
<P>They tollerate Polligamy, and Sodomy; yea, what else their lustfull idle natures can dictate to please their effeminacies. They are generally crafty, proud, lasie, jealous, complementall, and voluptuous. Musick, Po∣etry, Painting, and Stage-plaies delight them exceedingly: they care not what they spend in luxury and fire-works: they eat in porcellane; and have their dyet in many but small dishes; their meat minc't, and which they take up with two sticks of bone or Jvory; but some have their nailes so long as may excuse them; for to touch their mouths or meat with fingers is held absurd and impious: their drinck is commonly hot, and by its tast and colour seemes to be such a Coho potion as they drinck in <HI>Persia;</HI> they drinck oft and little. The Louthya's are served on the knee, and much re∣garded; they all sit upon stooles and eat on Tables. And albeit no Nation in the world is more idle and gluttenous; yet are no beggars to be found there; if he be young and beg, the whip rewards him; if old or lame, or blind, the Hospitall releeves him. Murder they punish with death; theft and adultery commonly with the strappado: their Justice is severe and impartiall; their prisons, strong; their executions, beheading; or star∣ving them. The Mandarins are honoured; the Chyam's reverenced; the King adored: no Subject nor Ambassador ever sees or speaks with him, (save his children and Eunuchs) except by petition. They suffer Ambassa∣dors (or others) to enter <HI>China</HI> so they bring presents of valew; otherwise they suspect them as spies and no way honour them. The Chynaes are curious in novelties: and love to see strange Arts; which they also delight∣fully practise: few of them but has skill in some thing; either in tillage, making <HI>China</HI> dishes or porcellane, to paint, sing, or play well: the Mathe∣maticks they affect, &amp; the civill Laws: they use not letters but Characters, or Hyerogliphicks, of which they have above 40000: they write neither to the right hand nor to the left, as the Latin and Hebrews did; but right downe and simmetrically: they write with pencills made of horse hayre,
<PB N="339" REF="174"/>
such as they also paint with: their language is most part of monosyllables: they be generally Poets and Musicians: affected with Rhetorick and Di∣vination. The Schollers and Merchants in this republique are much more honoured than the Souldiers bee: and some reason they have for it, They are so cowardly, lasie, and tyrannicall. No people in the world more ho∣nour their King than do the Chynaes: they suppose him too glorious for them to look upon; they obey his will in every thing; they fill his Ex∣chequor yeerely with above a hundred millions of crownes; they call him The undaunted Emperour, and great Lord of the whole World; Son of the Sun; and beauty of the whole Earth.</P>
<P>No people whatsoever, expresse more filiall respect unto their Parents than the Chyneses do: they obey them at all times, and every where: they do nothing to displease them: they marry not without their assent: their childrens Names are at their disposing: they honour them, bee they never so meane; releeve them, bee they never so poore; at their death, expresse all symptoms possible of their loyalty and duty: and sel∣dome mourne lesse (in white linnen, as did the Jewes) than two or three yeeres; the longer they mourne, they think they the better expresse af∣fection.</P>
<P>They arrogate all sorts of excellencies whether in Art or Science, as peculiar to their Nation: they think their Speech the most sweet and rhe∣toricall of any in the world: what other people have, they judge deduct∣ed and borrowed from their transcendent Notions. They say they are the most ancient and immixt people in the Universe; and borrow nothing of any other Nation. They say they first invented Letters (or Characters,) Guns, Painting, Tillage, and Navigation: yet in none of these (for all their brags) can they parallell us of <HI>Europe.</HI> For their antiquity, I deny not but they may have continued their plantation and without much mixture (admirable if so, for the Tartarrs and Siamits have oft over-runne them) since the first seminary, begunne by <HI>Sem</HI> in those parts: yet may others in that point compare with them; I might nominate the Bryttains: for I re∣gard not their Lies and Histories of such Kings as reigned, or such Con∣quests as the Chyneses obteined (long before the birth of Time) a hun∣dred thousand yeeres ago; unlesse wee qualifie it by the example of the Arcadians, whose yeare had but ninety dayes; of the Massagers, who had fifteen yeeres, or of the Aegyptians who had twelve yeeres in one of ours; following the course of the Moone, and not the revolution of the Sunne, nor regarding the <HI>Dies intercalares:</HI> an error, most of the Orientall Eth∣niques are plunged in. Their letters are not so succinct as ours: their Hieroglyphicks come short of the Aegyptians. Their Guns are not so serviceable: they have them not above a span long; so that they rather resemble Pistols than Guns: nor are their bore nor squaring so good as ours; so strong, so near, so mathematicall. Their painting is of good co∣lours; but their designing farre short of our invention: they draw the postures filthily, and shadow meanly; which doubtlesse in painting makes the perfection. Their husbandry is without Art or Reason: the graine is good, the soyle rich, the Zone moderate; and yet their corne is neither so various, so good, nor so certaine, as be our Harvests. Their Na∣vigation
<PB N="340" REF="175"/>
is lame: they build many ships; but without beauty, or service: nor have they much skill in sayling, their Logarithms and Mathematick instruments to take the height of the Sun by failing them: their Compasse also is defective; for they have but eight or twelve points at most to di∣stinguish by: nor is the Magnet (till of late) acquainted with them: for all which, they say they see with two eyes; we with one; and that all o∣ther people be more than purblind in sottish ignorance.</P>
<P>They delight excessively in all sorts of games, and voluptuousnesse: they can play at chesse, irish, passage, in and in, hazard; and not only play great games, but when they have lost, care not though they stake their wives and children; whom if they lose, they part with till they can ad∣vance so much money as they were staked for. They are very hospitable one to another, and have so sure a faith of the Resurrection that they some∣times lend money to be repayed them in the world to come. Inter-Iudes, Masqs, Fire-workes, and such devices wonderfully take them: nor valew they what money they expend in such sport, so their expectation bee not deluded. Their houses are meanly built, and as badly furnished. Their Meani or Temples have no such grandeur, nor beauty, as in a Countrey so peacefull, so rich, and amongst a people so studious, so superstitious, might be chalenged: but though their outsides bee but ordinary, yet bee they many times lined with excellent good Marble, Prophyre and Ser∣pentine.</P>
<P>They celebrate their Natalitia or Birth-daies with great solemnity: for fifteene dayes they rejoyce and play; and each night gormundise up∣on choice fruits, wines, and cates, with no small voracity. The New yeere, which they begin in March, is no lesse illustrated: at that time every man reares up his Pageant, and beautifies his door with paper Arches, and Ima∣ges, and all the night long makes them visible by store of Lantherns.</P>
<P>Their Weddings have equal Ceremony: greater or lesser after the qua∣lity of the Deceased. When any Chyna dies, they wash him every where, perfume him next, and then apparrell him: they put his best cloaths on, and hate to let his head be naked: that done, they seat him in his chayre, and make him sit as if hee were not dead but living. At a set time his wife enters the roome; she first does him respect, kisses him, and takes her farewell by expressing so much love and sorrow as is possible: at her departure she takes her lodging, and her children next enter; where they kneele and kisse his hands, yea sympathise, and strive to out-vie each o∣ther in their ejaculations, and such outward notions of sorrow and piety as is imaginable; beating their breasts, and powring out teares in abun∣dance: next to them his kindred do their parts, and then his friends and other acquaintance: the third day they coffin him, in most pretious wood; cover it with a costly cloth, and over it place his Image: for fifteen dayes the corps rest so; each day having a Table spread with dainty meats, but nightly the Priests eat it and burne Incense, &amp; offer an expiatory Sacrifice: when they carry it to the grave (which is neither within any Town nor Citie) they have women that do accompany it, purposely hyred to howle, to teare their hayre, and to move others to compassion: sometimes upon his coffin they place divers pictures of dead men, whom they intreat to
<PB N="341" REF="175" MS="y"/>
shew him the best way to Paradise: that done, his wife and children for some dayes seclude themselves from sight of men: and when they go a∣broad, go dolorously habited: they put course sack-cloth next their skin; have their cloaths made long and plain; and for three yeeres scarce laugh, or seeme to joy in any thing: but contrariwise indeavour to the utmost of their power to agrandise their Duty by a continued lamentation, absti∣nence from publique feasts, and pastimes: yea in all their letters, instead of their Names subscribe themselves Such a ones disobedient and unworthy Child, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But for all this, the Devill has too great a soveraignty over them: most of their Colledges and Temples expressing by one or other invention, their infernall wisdome, and familiarity with that old Magician; to whom they devote many enthusiastick boyes, who with their long spread haire, prostrate themselves afore the Mannada or Idoll; and suddenly as if some Hag had terrified them, start up and vibrate their swords, kept there of purpose: whiles the Idolaters with dejected lookes note their antick po∣stures, and cease not to warble out a soft Doriq' sort of musick, not de∣parting till the vaticinating youths pronounce somewhat, poynting at his Worship and their Obedience.</P>
<P>But we have saild too far. Tis high time to look homewards. Yet not till we have bid farewell to <HI>Asia:</HI> into which when others adventure, let this Motto be remembred.</P>

<P>How delightfull &amp; how magical the excellencies &amp; riches of the Orient are, yet <HI>Ovid's Nescio qua natale Solum, &amp;c.</HI> was my song and blest mee in my succesfull wishes: so that upon the seventh of June (after long saile, some stormes, and much patience,) we againe described land: it bore N.N.W. from us, but at <HI>Tytans</HI> first blush the ensuing morning, we were assured it was <HI>Digarroys,</HI> a small Ile, about fifty miles about, and in 20 degrees South latitude: there we anchored not, wee knew <HI>Moritius</HI> was but 90 leagues distant thence; the course W.N.W. a more hospitable place, and where we expected better welcome and refreshment.</P>
<P><HI>Digarroys</HI> (as Sea-men tell us) was first discovered by the Portuguise: but except some Welsh-man had the honour of naming it, I know not whence calld <HI>Dygarroys,</HI> for <HI>Digarrad</HI> in the British dialect fitly com∣plies with it, An Ile so Desolate: desolate I mean in humane Inhabitants; other things 'tis Uberous in, as Wood, (choyce and store) Tortoises, Do∣dos, and other Fowle rare &amp; serviceable. To our view, it gave it selfe not very high at 6 leag. distance: and this remember, that at the South-West-end are Syrtes or shoalds long and very dangerous.

<P>MAURITIUS (an Ile scituate within the burning Zone, not farre from the Tropick of <HI>Capricorne</HI>) has twenty degrees, five minutes Antarcick latitude; longitude from the Meridian of Cape <HI>Comoryn,</HI> twenty degrees and as many minutes; variation, foure and twenty degrees and nineteene minutes: In what part of the World, questionable; participa∣ting both with <HI>America,</HI> in respect of that vast South Ocean; as bending towards the Asiatique Seas, washing <HI>India, Iava,</HI> and other Iles; and with <HI>Afrique</HI> also, if you ranck her with that Empresse of Iles, <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which seemes to shadow her, and from whose Easterne banks shee is removed above a hundred leagues or three hundred English miles: But, however doubtfull to which three it appertaines; of this I nothing doubt; that, for variety of Gods temporall blessings no part of the Universe obscures it. I will not satisfie you by report of others, but by being an eye-witnesse in part, and partly expert in the rest, I may without much hyperbolizing, af∣firme the whole scarce to be parelleld.

This also remembred, that in the yeare 1505, when <HI>Franciscus Almeyda,</HI> of all the Portugalls the most excellent in conquest and discoverie, subjected many marittim parts of <HI>Aegi-symba</HI> or South-<HI>Afrique,</HI> in <HI>Quiloa, Mombazza, Melindé, Mozambyc,</HI> &amp;c Hee reports that there and in some Iles (I suppose this one,) where hee erected Forts and Castles of defence, he found Crosses and other symbolls of Christianitie: whereby (as <HI>Osorius</HI> in his 4. <HI>lib.</HI>) hee was sure Christ had beene served there, and therefore would not esteeme himselfe of any of those parts, The first Christian discoverer.</P>
<P><HI>Mauritius</HI> is an Ile abounding with all good things requisite for mans use, and require-able for the Zone 'tis placed in: the land (especially where it respects the Sea) is high and mountainous: the shape somewhat round; the circuit not much above a hundred English miles: the greatest extent is from the North East to South-West: every where sweet &amp; flourishing. It procreates a healthie ayre; the blooming fragrant trees both lenifie the scalding heat such time as <HI>Don-Phoebus</HI> wantonizes with the Goat; and fan the gentle Breezes wasted from the <HI>Noto-Zephirus,</HI> such time as <HI>Sol</HI> re∣sides in <HI>Cancer.</HI> And here I should set a full point to her commendations, did that ignorant opinion of our home-bred Seniors discourage me, af∣firming positively that the Torrid Zone was un-inhabitable: a conceit sometime predominating; but now that mist of error is dispell'd, the vaile removed, and experience advanced: wee see it yearely, and plainly, that no place 'twixt the two Poles is more habitable, more young, more excel∣lent. I grant; the Zone is twice every yeare subject to the Sunnes ex∣treamest Candor, that the ayre enflames, and that clouds doe not there so usually as else-where in colder Regions generate: but, two Winters they also have, they want not clouds; (for, the benevolent heaven daily diffudes a gentle shower, whereby the earths siccity is mollified and made most ube∣rous,) the ayre also is lenified by a constant breez or favonius which breaths sweetly every day towards Sun-set, and so refrigerates, that no distempe∣rature is perceived, no not when <HI>Apollo</HI> dimits his perpendicular rayes and divests himselfe in his most ardent splendour: yea, when the Dog-starre rages, the people in this Zone find the ayre salubrious: the ground also in

most places is enricht with delicious sleepe-charming streames, which by their infusion not only fructifie the solid earth, but also by a harmonious progresse affoord an unresistable magique to ease and meditation: the in∣finite store of loftie and spreading trees, all the yeare condecorated with such verdant beautie and fragrancie; their boughes never unapparrelled from their Summer liverie; the ground ever spread with Natures choisest tapestrie; the sap never exiled into the melancholy earth by Winters fri∣giditie; yea, the mirthfull Sunne (the provoker and reviver of decayed Nature) is ever pleased to re-enforce a continued vigour and activitie; so as an Epitome of all delight and plenty seeme contracted here, and to display it selfe in her exact content, health, and braverie, Such as some have fabled of Elizium.

And as that body is best compounded which pertakes indifferently of all the Elements; for either to want or superabound, begets defect: so, to be blest in all, this place (humane societie excepted) is abortive in none. For, water is here in plenty; nor is its goodnesse and sweetnesse excell'd by plentie; but, as it gently drills it selfe from the stupendious rocks; so it trickles along the pleasant valleyes, as it were besotted at the delightfull murmur it liveth in: in some places it spreads into Meanders, till (too se∣cure in its owne mildnesse) it commixes, and is ingulpht by that vast and brinie Ocean. It also abounds in divers sorts of Trees: some, good for tim∣ber; others for food; all for use. I cannot tell you the halfe of them, I want names to speake, and Art to describe them by. There, is store of Box (as they first appeare, so I remember them) whose growth and green∣nesse affoords profit and delight: here is also great store of Ebony, of all sorts; black, red, white, and yellow: the tree is high, small and straight, the out-side is covered with bark; the in-side lyned with Ebony: black is the best, and good for maay noble uses; for frames of pictures, Mathema∣tique instruments, Chess' and playing tables, bowles, &amp;c. so rich, so valu∣able, that few yeares passe but either Dutch or French Ships came to this Ile of purpose to load away with nothing else but Ebony: than which, no wood is better; than which, no Ile in the world has more, more sorts, or lesse chargeable: and if <HI>Virgil's</HI> conceit may carry it, we may conclude this Ile a member of East <HI>India.</HI>

I could hardly beget passages. The Palmeto is a remarkable Tree and most beneficiall to Travellers: 'tis like the Coco or Date in growth, save that her boughes are large and rounder: the Palmeto is long, and straight, and round, and soft; without leafe, bough, or branch, save at the very top; and those are few, and greene, and sedgie: under the branch appeare certaine codded seeds: both trees (male and female) blossome, but the shee is only fruitfull; and not so neither, unlesse a flowring branch of the male tree be yearely innoculated or incorporated, that by a commixture of seed the fe∣male may fructifie; no miracle in Nature: the leaves serve for many uses; wee made them cover our Tents, to shade us from the Sun and the sere∣nes which fall nightly, and are dangerous: at the top of the Palmeto tree is a soft pith, in which consists the soule or vergetative vertue, for being cut out the tree dyes; the pith is in bignesse like a small Cabbage, in taste like a Nut, but boyld eats like a Colli-flory. Of more value is the Palmeto wine; it is must or sweet, pleasant and nourishing; in colour and taste not unlike new Muskadine. It is intoxicating, but cold in the digestion; it pur∣ges and helps obstructions, kills wormes, and let stand two dayes in the Sun, becomes good vinegar. The wine is thus gathered: we peirce or cut small holes in three or foure trees that grow together; the sap or liquor effudes presently, and all the holes or vessells are quickly filled: impatience for∣bids to bring wooden barrycoes thither, our bellies were prepared to re∣ceive it; by help of a Cane or Quill we suck and suck againe, from one tree to another, two or three trees in lesse than an houre repletiating the gree∣diest appetites, though they bowze their bellies full.</P>

<P>For indeed, such is the life and pleasure of this Ambrosia, that (I often noted it) wee were no sooner parted from these trees (no not three yards space) but divers birds, as Parrats, Kites, Thrushes, &amp;c. and Lizards (here abounding, and not a little curious in their shape and colours) would speed to suck the distilling Nectar.</P>
<P>Divers other Trees here are, various in their shape and nature: one, out of curiosity I bit and tasted of, but for halfe an houre it so malignantly wrongd my mouth and lips, as if Vitriol had beene imbrued with Sulphur: it procreates nothing that is greene or good, destitute of shade and beauty, wholy naked, without leafe or flower; the bole or body is soft and pene∣trable, such as a Musquet bullet can make way thorough though the Tree be of five yards circuit; the softnesse of it invited my knife to carve my name in, and which, it as easily performed, as with a stick you can write in sand; I have no name for it. Nor for another very frequent there, but by its likenesse the same which the barbarous Africans at <HI>Sierra-leon</HI> call <HI>O'gou,</HI> with which they invenome their Darts and Shafts: the Tree is not high nor bungie; the branches spread to a great length, and beare many Cods (not unlike the Indian Beanes) arm'd with many sharp prickles: by such a defence one would think the fruit or kernell valuable, but it decei∣ved us; the fruit (or kernell hid within those Cods) is round, scarce so big as a Doves egge; the shell, and colour very like a Bezar stone; hard to crack, but crackt it may be; within, it has a Nut, tasted like an Acorne, the quality (if not the same) little better than poyson. Many other rare
<PB N="347" REF="178"/>
Trees there are; some, like unto Pines; like Ashes, some; some, Box; some like to Cypresses. The fruits are also variable, some like Pine-Apples, like Artichoakes some, others like Plums, and Nuts, and Berries: whose seve∣rall names or vertues, my small skill in that Theory apprehends not. This I tooke notice of, that what the Birds eat not, the Tortoyses doe eat; and what the Tortoyses refuse to eat, the Hoggs devoure: so, as by one or other, all is tasted of. Againe, as this noble Ile is prodigall in her water and wood, so shee corresponds in what else a fruitfull Parent labours in: not only boasting in that variety, but in feathered creatures also; yea, in the rarenesse of that variety: I will but name some of them; you shall lick them to perfection. The Dodo comes first to our description: here, and in <HI>Dygarrois</HI> (and no where else, that ever I could see or heare of) is gene∣rated the Dodo (a Portuguize name it is, and has reference to her simple∣nes,) a Bird which for shape and rarenesse might be call'd a Phoenix (wer't in <HI>Arabia:</HI>) her body is round and extreame fat, her slow pace begets that corpulencie; few of them weigh lesse than fifty pound: better to the eye than stomack: greasie appetites may perhaps commend them, but to the indifferently curious, nourishment, but prove offensive. Let's take her picture: her visage darts forth melancholy, as sensible of Natures injurie in framing so great and massie a body to be directed by such small and com∣plementall wings, as are unable to hoise her from the ground, serving only to prove her a Bird; which otherwise might be doubted of: her head is va∣riously drest, the one halfe hooded with downy blackish feathers; the other, perfectly naked; of a whitish hue, as if a transparent Lawne had co∣vered it: her bill is very howked and bends downwards, the thrill or breathing place is in the midst of it; from which part to the end, the co∣lour is a light greene mixt with a pale yellow; her eyes be round and small, and bright as Diamonds; her cloathing is of finest Downe, such as you see in Goslins: her trayne is (like a <HI>China</HI> beard) of three or foure short feathers; her legs thick, and black, and strong; her tallons or pounces sharp, her stomack fiery hot, so as stones and iron are easily digested in it; in that and shape, not a little resembling the <HI>Africk</HI> Oestriches: but so much, as for their more certain difference I dare to give thee (with two others) her representation.</P>

<P>Here are also as great variety of fish, as in any other part of the world, I thinck: such as wee took and tasted of I noted. The Man-atee or Cow-fish was best and rarest; for taste and shape equally can appose both feeder and beholder. They use both elements; those very fins which steare them in the Sea, serve as stilts on shore to creep along, and to support them; their paps also in their land travels do befriend them: and though a fish, yet differ little from Veale in tast, save that it is somewhat waterish; the ribs and entralls resemble a Cows, so do their face, and thence have their denomination: for doubtlesse the land has not that creature which the watery citizens resemble not. This fish is of a great length, and swims but slowly; they affect shoald waters, and to be neare the shoare to graze on; <HI>Andrew Evans</HI> our honest Captaine, struck one of them with a Trident or Fis-gigg, and (here in this Bay) leapt upon her, wounding her above fifty times with his steletto, but ere hee got the victory, she crusht him by incir∣cling him with her taile, enraged by sharp pangs of death, so that his con∣quest was dearly bought; for though at that present he spat blood without feeling other torture, yet so mortall was his bruise, that he bade this world farewell, within three weekes after; as in my description of <HI>Saint Helena</HI> is remembred. The head of this fish is like an Elephant (save that the pro∣boscis is wanting:) but to a Cow most liken her: her eyes are very small; her bulk, about three yards long; and in bredth halfe so much: 'tis fa∣moused for a gentle fish; yea in their love to the visage of a man, are ranckt with Dolphins: most certaine and most valewable is the stone con∣solidated in their heads: for, being pounded, put in wine, &amp; drunck fasting, it is (as are the brains of Sharks, some call them Tuberons) most soveraigne against the stone and collick: questionlesse of more prise than his other six great teeth, which yet to him are farre more usefull.</P>
<P>Give mee leave to name what fish wee took, 'twill ease my memory: Dolphins, Bonetates, Albicores, Cavalloes, Whale, Porpice, Grampasse, (or <HI>Sus-marinus,</HI>) Mullet, Bream, Tench, Trout, Soles, Flounders, Tor∣toyses, Eeles, Pikes, Sharkes, Crabs, Lobsters, Oysters, Crafish, Cuttle-fish, Rock-fish, Limpits, and a speckled Toad-fish or poyson fish, as the Sea-men from experience named it: This came first to net and was eaten

too greedily by the heedles Sailers; an error which cost some their lives, others their sences; a deere rate, a bad reckning: It is not unlike a Tench, but farre more black, meazled, and deformedly painted. Other strange made Fishes we had there, who met with some strange stomacks, who in a dangerous curiosity would needs tast them: some of them had the shape of Hedg-hogs, of Cats some: some were bungy, others bristly and trian∣guler; such as <HI>Gorraeus</HI> calls <HI>Lepus marinus,</HI> of which and the rest this caveat may be inserted.</P>

<P>Moreover, this Ile affoords us Goats, Hogs, Beeves, and land Tortoi∣ses: so great, as suffer two men with ease to sit upon them; so strong, as they can carry them: yea (in Portugall reports,) fifteene men have alto∣gether stood on one of them: Sailers affect to eat them; but are better meat for Hogs, in my opinion: they make pretty sport, but are odious food; and so are their Rats, Bats, and Monkeys: most of which usefull and unusefull creatures were first brought hither (men say) by the Portu∣gall to refresh them in their returne from <HI>India,</HI> but at this day dare nei∣ther anchor there (searing the Eaglish and Dutch,) nor owne their first∣lings. The Birds, had here at no charge and little labour, are Hens, Bats, Herns, &amp;c. The Hens flock together twenty and forty in a company; if you catch one, take all: the surest way is to shew them a red cloth; that colour exasperates their spleen, they shew it by flying out-ragiously at it; and when wee struck downe one, the residue budgd not one jot till all were vanquished: they eat like parcht Piggs if you roast them. The Herons also through a long continued security (ignorant of the deceits of men, and unused to the villany of powder) are as easily gotten: wee have come in shot of six, and when wee had killd one, the other took not wing but suffered us to shoot and take them all, one after another; neither know∣ing nor valuing danger, but quicken destruction to themselves by a strange condoling their late dead associates. All sorts of fish are easily taken. The Bats are innumerable, and admirable in their bignesse: Some of them are not lesse than Gos-haukes: Sea-men case them like Rabbets, but (if my stomack deceive me not) worse meat cannot be tasted of: a fierce ilfavo∣red

<P>A day afore wee parted thence, wee took a Fish, an Eagle-fish I ima∣gin'd it: the eyes were five quarters asunder: from one fin end to ano∣ther, were above foure yards: its mouth and teeth resembled a Port-cul∣lice; a long small taile it had: a creature (take it altogether) rather made to wonder at, than to juncket on.</P>

A word now of the Soyle it selfe.</P>
<P>The Ile has many good places to anchor in: two are well knowne; the one, at the North-West side, which beares the forme of a Hemi-cicle, and elevates the Pole Antartique, 19 degrees, and 30 minutes: the other, at the South-East is directly opposite, and in 20 degrees, 15 minutes; in lon∣gitude from Cape <HI>Comryn</HI> the utmost promontory of <HI>India,</HI> 20 degrees, 20 minutes: and from the Lizard the extreamest part of England, 99. both Bayes seeme land-lockt, the ground is oazy, the depth in 5, 10, 15, or 20 fadoms, as the Sea-man best affects: No where dangerous. The Soile it selfe; is stony and troublesome towards the shoare; howbeit the in∣land parts are fat, and pleasant, full of shadowing trees, and drilling rivo∣lets, reciprocally benevolent, equally delightfull to the eye and taste: some few places excepted; which either storming at the aspiring height of some adjacent Mountaines, or efflated in their owne noise, descend so violently that they become Cataracts in their violent and precipitious
<PB N="351" REF="180"/>
fluxes: but, though the eare be angry at it, the other sences derive much happinesse; for hereby the earth is mellowed and made fruitfull, which otherwise would bee too full of stones and sand; yet such is the richnesse of it, as rather commands us wonder at, than describe it. Amber-grease is often found flooting about this Iland: how generated, whether in the Whale, or froth of Seas, or other wise, is yet doubted of. Corall, white and pleasant to look upon, grows here in abunda-ce: but how that stincking weed Tobacco came thither I know not: whether by Art or Nature que∣stionable. To conclude, this pleasantest of Asiatick Iles is un-inhabited, unlesse you please to intitle Beasts and Birds Inhabitants: those live here without dread of Lyon, Tygre, Wolfe, Fox, Dog, or such offensive crea∣tures; and have it upon this condition, to pay a gracefull Tith or Tribute to such ships as famine or foule weather direct to ride here: a fit place for Sir <HI>Thomas Moore</HI> to have seated his Utopia in. But his conceits were for∣ged: this merits the best of people.</P>
<P>If I have stood too long in her description, excuse it in the surpassing delight I took in it, such as without <HI>Circe's</HI> spells had a magick force To wish wee dwelt there. But home we must; the wind blew faire, the Sea was calme and all our company fully refreshed. So, aboard wee went, and in three houres saile lost sight of that Elisium; wishing such an Optick glasse as every where would shew it us: but our strong imaginations repre∣sent it.</P>
<P>The fift day we descried land; it bore South-West from us: by its height, shape, and position, wee knew 'twas that our Captaines called Englands Forrest: next day we attained it. The name was <HI>Anno</HI> 1613. imposed by Captaine <HI>Castleton</HI> Commander of the Pearle (a ship I meane:) some say the errant Potugall first saw it, and by Seignior <HI>Mascarenas</HI> from his owne name was denominated: yet other-some go further and call it <HI>Pulo-puar,</HI> an Indian name, but by whom or when, darkly writ in the mistique Cha∣racter of Oblivion. The Ile has above fifty English miles circuit: the South Pole is elevated in that place, 20 degrees, and 55 minutes, South from the Aequator: in longitude from <HI>Mauritius</HI> 1 degree and a halfe: (but distant thence, seven and thirty Duch leagues:) and variation of the Compasse 23 degrees: an Ile exceeding lofty, made fying her aspiring fore∣head within the middle Region: every where greene, and ever florish∣ing; pleasantly apparelled in various liveries; especially in store of trees, branching gallantly, and mounting to a rare sublimity. It had no Creature in it, save birds; till our Captaine landed some Hogs and Goats of both kinds, that by a happy multiplication and encrease the future Passenger might be releeved and blesse the Planter. It wants not water, sweet and plentifull: the fresh streams are Magazeins of watry Citizens, such as sport themselves in that liquid Element: 'twere prolixity to name halfe of them; the Eeles are notable; many there be, and most weigh thirty pounds; not odious in their corpulency, for to the tast they render themselves sweet, moist, and excellent: the birds are many, rare, but most of them such as are spoken of in the <HI>Mauritius.</HI></P>
<P>We must to Sea againe, but not without a gratefull farewell to those

healthy and well-plac't Ilands, prepossest with a felicitated memoriall, yea enricht with so great choice, such plenty of victualls, that the vast and churlish Ocean became lesse distastfull to us; contemplating the jocune exercises and pleasures we were so late possessors of.</P>
<P>In few dayes (by benefit of propitious windes) we lancht farre into the <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> the Antartick constellations more visibly discovering them∣selves, and to approach our Zenyth. But, long those happy Favonii con∣tinued not: the wind veered into other (our contrary) quarters; the Skie ore-spread with black and lowring clowds, the Sea roar'd and labour'd in many dreadfull tumors, threatning spight, and no small danger: for seaven whole dayes and nights the Tempest raged, and forced us all that while to lye by the Lee (to speake Sea language) no saile but the mizzen daring to oppose, the rest made prostrate to a sencelesse furie: howbeit, the old song <HI>Venit post multos una serena Dies</HI> revived us, by a continued patience begetting freedome and victory.</P>
<P>For many hundred miles we had nothing bat Sea and Ayre to feast our sights with: somwhat bettered by many shoales of fish every where con∣comitating us, now and then by too much greedinesse proffering them∣selves to the deceitfull bait of the cunning Marriner. In this vacancie, I may remember; <HI>Aristotle</HI> 2 <HI>lib. Meteor</HI> is of opinion, that no great blasts of wind blow from the South; meaning, that the burning Zone is without much raine, and clouds, such as conduce to exhalation and vapours: or, that before they can exceed the Tropicks, and enter the temperate Zone, the Sunnes vehement and continued heat and rays dispell, annihilate, and make them unforceable. Doubtlesse he retracted; for who sees not, that <HI>Phoebus</HI> in his attractive power (so, the matter be alike) equally co-operates towards a generation of wind and raine in his progresse unto either Tro∣pick. Experience, the Mistresse of Knowledge taught it us; we found it so: for from the South many gusts and stormes assailed us. <HI>Ovid</HI> in his 4 <HI>lib. de Ponto</HI> is of <HI>Aristotles</HI> opinion (to be granted in our Hemispheare.)</P>

<P>After threescore and ten dayes further saile, wee came in view of Saint <HI>Helena,</HI> (so long were wee with faire winds 'twixt that Ile and the <HI>Mauri∣tius;</HI>) a very little Ile and strangely founded. The spatious Ocean bel∣lowes on every side so fretfully, as it might feare an inundation, had not the extraordinarie height, but chiefly a Supreame providence (which hath set the Sea its bounds) safe-guarded it. It has no neighbour Iles, neither great nor small; but seemes equally removed from those two famous Ports <HI>Rio Grandi</HI> and Cape <HI>Negro;</HI> the one in <HI>Brazelia,</HI> th'other in <HI>Congo:</HI> in <HI>America</HI> the first; in <HI>Africk</HI> the last: both, in one elevation, and in the same parallel with Saint <HI>Helena:</HI> from that in <HI>America,</HI> distant above 400 leagues; from this in <HI>Africk</HI> 300. But let us a shoare, and search what she aboundeth in.</P>

<HEAD>Of Helena.</HEAD>
<P>SAINT HELENA is an Ile, &amp; was in-nominate till <HI>Iohn de Nova</HI> gave it one, in the yeare after th'incarnation of our Saviour Christ 1502: and so named, for that he discovered it (in this returne from <HI>India</HI> to <HI>Lisbon</HI>) the third of May; a day consecrated to the memory of <HI>Helena</HI> the Empresse: She that first found the Crosse, she that was the most religious of Ladies in her time, she that was mother to the first Christian Emperour, great <HI>Con∣stantine:</HI> both of them glorious to the world; <HI>Brittans</HI> both; both bright Jems of this our Nation.</P>
<P>S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Helena</HI> is removed South from the Aequator sixteene degrees: has longitude from the utmost promontory of South <HI>Africk,</HI> two and twenty degrees: the needle varies there, five degrees and thirteene minutes From the lands end of <HI>England</HI> is distant 1500 leagues, or 4500 English miles: From the Cape of <HI>Good hope</HI> 580 leagues, or 1740 miles. From <HI>Mada∣gascar</HI> 1000 leagues, or 3000 miles. From <HI>Surat</HI> 2200 leagues, or 6600 miles. And from <HI>Bantam</HI> in <HI>Iava</HI> 2300 leagues, or 6900 miles, or there∣abouts. The Ile has this front in that Bay which takes name from the Chappell, nigh which we anchored.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

To what part of th'inhabited world it appertaines, is doubtfull; the vast Aethiopique Ocean so largely circles it. To <HI>Afer</HI> I imagine (because its neerest to that Continent,) rather than <HI>Vesputius.</HI> The Ile is small; it exceeds not thirty English miles in circumference: excessive high; it wraps its head for the most part in the clouds, where it opens its wide mouth, and gulps down sufficient moisture to coole its heat, and fatten it: and but for that affinity it has with the middle Region which invelops it with a chil-cold Tulipant, the extreame heat wanton <HI>Phaeton</HI> darts con∣stantly in that Zone, yea twice every yeare perpendicularly upon this Ile when hee is Zenith, would doubtlesse incinerate, and make the entralls enflame (for it has Sulphur) like another <HI>Vesuvius.</HI> The land (I told you) is very high, but not more eminent in its height, than the Sea (close by the Ile) is admirable in the depth; so deepe that it admits ill anchoring (a place, N.W. from the channell where is riding at 20 fadoms, excepted;) where∣by,
<PB N="354" REF="182"/>
Marriners are forced to carry their anchors a shoare, if they would ride securely: and with good cause too; for, by reason of the abisse, I could hardly discerne any flux or reflux, as if wee had beene neere no land, but rather in the body of the Sea, where neither ebb nor flow can be disco∣vered: the salt water indeed continually plashes and froaths with rage to see it selfe to suddenly resisted; but, the moist breath usually vapring in or upon the Seas occasions it, and makes it turbulent.</P>
<P>The Ile is hard to be ascended; not that the passage is craggie, but pre∣cipitious: the Sailers Proverb of it is, A man may choose whither he will break his heart going up, or his neck in comming down; a merry jeast, but let them choose it. Once up, no place yeelds a more delightfull object. It is even and plaine above, swelling no where to a deformed rising; cloath'd with sweet grasse, long and curious; every where it gives a large prospect and horizon into the Ocean. The Springs above are sweet, but below are brackish; the reason is, they participate (in their drilling discent) of the salt hills, through which it cuts a passage; salt both by their owne compo∣sition, and the salt breath the Sea perpetually evaporates. There are but two rivolets in that Ile: the one bubbles down into the Chappell, th'other into the Lemmon Vallyes. They take their names frō a Lemon tree whence it arises, and an old Chappell built at the very bottome by the Spaniard <HI>Anno</HI> 1571, and delapidated by the Dutch; a place once intended for Gods glory, but by malice of rude man made ruinous and a prophane nest of un∣cleane avarice. The ruines of a little Towne demolisht lately shew them∣selves, and serve to testifie a like Fate makes men and Villages dye, Death and destruction makes both mortall and miserable. Some say the Spanish King subverted it, in that it became an unlawfull Magazein of Sea-mens Traffick, turning and returning out of both the Indyes: thereby losing his tribute in too apparent measure. It is but lately made sociable: the world is but beginning there; no Monuments, no Antique rarities are there found. You see all, if you looke upon the shatterd ribs of an old weather beaten Carrique, and some broken peeces of great Ordnance left there against the Owners good liking, and serve now in stead of Anchors. The Ile is desolate of reasonable Inhabitants: Hoggs and Goats dwell there: they agree well-favouredly, and multiply in mighty numbers; happy in their ease and safety, till ships arrive there to banish hunger: wee got also other good refreshment; Phesants, Powts, Quailes, Henns, Partrich; and (which were as acceptable) divers sorts of grasse &amp; roots, Wood-sorrell, three-leav'd-grasse, Basil, Parsly, Mints, Spinage, Fennel, Annys, Radish, Mustard-seed, Tobacco, and some others, which by a willing hand, directed by an ingenious eye, may soone be gathered: brought hither, and here sowne by <HI>Fernandus Lupius</HI> an honest Portugall, in the yeare of our Lord 1509. whose Country-men at this day dare hardly land there to over-see their Seminary, or owne their labours; lest the English or Hollander in the churlish language of a Cannon question them. <HI>Anno</HI> 1588 <HI>Candish</HI> our Country-man landed here in his circum-navigating the earth: I name him in this respect; he reports, he found here store of Lemmons, Orenges, Pomgranads, Pomcitrons, Figgs, Dates &amp;c. but now are none of these fruits growing there that I could see or heare of, a Lemmon tree excepted;
<PB N="355" REF="182" MS="y"/>
to conclude, here wee buried in the old Chappell our honest Captaine <HI>Andrew Evans:</HI> his deaths wound (as I have told you) was given him by a fish at the <HI>Mauritius.</HI></P>
<P>Saint <HI>Hellena</HI> was a pleasant place, but bad for us to stay too long in: after six dayes commorance, wee paid our reckning in a hearty Farwell, and by benefit of a happy gale cut swiftly the yeelding billowes in a North∣west course; whereby, on the sixteenth of October wee made our selves Nadyr to the Sunne, at that time in his Progresse towards the Antartique Tropick: our latitude was 13 deg. and 13 min: the third day after that we got sight of <HI>Ascention Ile,</HI> nam'd so by <HI>Iohn de Nova</HI> in the yeare 1502: 'tis removed South from the Equinoctiall Circle seven degrees, 40 minutes: in circuit it is 30 English miles; from S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Hellens</HI> Ile removed seven hundred and twenty: little in it save wood and water, observable.</P>
<P>On the seven and twentieth day we crost under the Aequator; whence, to nine degrees North latitude wee were pesterd with continuall Torna∣thes; a variable weather, compos'd of lowd blasts, stinking showers, and terrible thunders. The eleventh of November we were parallel to <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> and with the GORGADES, Isles famoused by antient Poets, who say, that the three Gorgons, <HI>Medusa, Stenia,</HI> and <HI>Euryale,</HI> the daughters of of King <HI>Phorcys Neptunes</HI> sonne here lived, and by the transcendent ex∣cellencie of their beauties (their yellow haires curling like Snakes, and deshevelling about their naked shoulders) turn'd the beholders into a stu∣pid admiration, and by <HI>Perseus</HI> his report of that their faculty gave Poets some ground whereon to build their fiction. Leaving those, wee steered Westward, and past by many parts of the New found world (as some men call it) <HI>Guiana, Florida, Virginia, Nova Anglia,</HI> (parts of <HI>Norumbega</HI>) and the gulph of <HI>Mexico:</HI> where I have seated my selfe a while, and will de∣fraud the Reader of some patience, by travelling to find out the first Disco∣verer: a Question not a little controverted.</P>

<P>ALbeit I have formerly in a line or two vindicated the honour of our Country, lost in the greater part by protract of malitious time, and wane of well-willers to defend it; I desire to speak more largely here, and give you the ground of my conjecture, That <HI>Madoc</HI> (sonne of <HI>Owyn Gwy∣neth</HI>) discovered the Westerne world now call'd <HI>America,</HI> three hundred and odd yeares before <HI>Columbus:</HI> not to detract from that mans worth, but that the truth may prevaile, and the memory of our Heroick Country-man revive; having gaspt too long in hatefull ignorance and oblivion: for, if analogie of language and authority of good Authors may be credited, it may peradventure be accepted of, yea amongst Critticks gaine entertain∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="183"/>In the first place it may be asked whence <HI>Madock's</HI> resolution came. I answer. From an innate desire to travell, and to avoid domestique broiles he put that in action which some old prophetique sayings gave him light and encouraged him in. 'Tis very like he had read <HI>Plato</HI> (for what part of the world has ever more affected learning than the <HI>Britians</HI>) who in his Dialogue 'twixt <HI>Tymeus</HI> and <HI>Cricius,</HI> discourses of a great vast Ile, West from the Atlantique Ocean, and named ATLAS: as bigg as <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> put together. Some Humination hee had also out of <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Theophrastus</HI> their Books of Rarities writ two thousand yeares agoe, re∣lating how some Merchants passing thorow the Straits of <HI>Gibralter,</HI> were by tempest driven whither wind and Sea compelled them, so farre West that they finally discried land, but un inhabited: It may be 'twas some of the <HI>Azores:</HI> but what ere it was, it proved a Magnet of encouragement to illure future Ages to discover Westward, and doubtlesse was a prime cause of finding out the Westerne Continent. <HI>Hanno</HI> also is supposed to have landed there. Questionlessed he adventured farre (far in regard they had no Compasse to returne by) into the Atlantique Seas; but which way he sail'd is disputable: West, some say: some say, Southward. <HI>Pomponius Mele</HI> and <HI>Lampridus</HI> affirme the land was South from <HI>Carthage</HI> hee discove∣red; if South, then no part of the West-Indies: the Canary Iles perhaps, the <HI>Atlantiades,</HI> the <HI>Gorgades, Ascention,</HI> or Saint <HI>Helens;</HI> who though they carry not the Epithite of Great, yet the Novelty considered, and the Distance, the word great may be affected. Some (but I beleeve them not) carry him to <HI>Madagascar:</HI> if that, hee discovered a great Ile indeed; But then sure he would have found out the Red Sea (not comparable to the dangers he had past, in doubling Cape <HI>Tormentoso</HI>) and made his journey home, lesse dangerous. <HI>Virgil</HI> the best of Latine Poets, from some vari∣cinating Notion seemes to point at it, in the 6. <HI>lib.

<P><HI>Madoc</HI> from these lights discerned it: And least any may thinck the man to whon we erect a Trophy of so great honour, an obscure or illite∣rate man, not worth a memory; let's in a line or two speak his discent and quality, and then the particulars of his vovage.</P>
<P>He was brother to Prince <HI>David,</HI> sonnes of that famous <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who for above thirty yeeres governed wisely, with great courage and good fortune: his Father was <HI>Gruffith ap Conan</HI> that did ho∣mage for some lands in <HI>England,</HI> to <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour at S. <HI>Davids:</HI> and descended lineally from King <HI>Rodri</HI> Mawr (or <HI>Roderic</HI> the great) glo∣rious in many, conflicts and victories against the savage <HI>Saxon;</HI> in those foure great battells especially, at <HI>Berthem, Bangelu, Monegid,</HI> and <HI>Anglesea,</HI> in the yeere from <HI>Adam</HI> 4820: from the nativity of our Blessed Saviour 846. such time as <HI>Burchred</HI> King of <HI>Mercia, Athelwolfe</HI> King of the West-Saysses, <HI>Meiric</HI> and other valiant Princes by sad tryall found him fortunate: which suffice to illustrate <HI>Madock's</HI> quality, every way exceeding honourable.</P>
<P>It followes why they put to Sea upon discovery. The Annalls of those times (to this day happily preserved) tell us, That so soone as <HI>Owen Gwy∣nedd</HI> (or <HI>Venedotia</HI>) was dead; the custome of Gavelkind (which has con∣founded <HI>Wales</HI>) became a Subject of implacable hate amongst his sonnes, <HI>Iorwerth</HI> (or <HI>Edward,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Dwryndwn,</HI> from his broken nose) <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>David;</HI> whose peculiar, ambition banisht all generall kinds of love due amongst friends and brethren. <HI>Iorwerth,</HI> albeit he was eldest, was held incapable of the Crowne in respect of his lamenesse and other deformi∣ties: <HI>Howel</HI> also was thought unworthy by reason his Mother was an Irish Lady, with which Nation they had then some difference: <HI>David</HI> had least right by law of Nature and Nations, being youngest; howbeit, by his comly personage, his skill in Armes, but principally by marrying <HI>Emma Plantaginet,</HI> sister to King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, hee got the Scepter into his hands, and swayed it as best liked him: yet the Crowne tottered upon his head, till in a victory against his brethren wherein <HI>Hoell</HI> was slaine, hee fitted it better and fastned it. But a supream power and Justice would not establish it against right and reason, for so soone as <HI>Llewellyn</HI> (<HI>Iorwerths</HI> sonne and right heyre) was capable to grasp it, hee drew many of <HI>Davids</HI> men to his party (such is the vulgars levity) promising them great matters; and ayded by <HI>Howell ap Meredith</HI> and <HI>Conan ap Owen</HI> his active kinsmen, <HI>David</HI> unwillingly descends from his Princely Seat, and <HI>Llewellyn</HI> is seated <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1194; not without much blood-shed and distraction of the wisest.</P>

(for nothing more destroyes a Nation than division:) and that his advice nor propositions of peace were harkned to, but rather by such good of∣fices made himselfe the object of their furie; he thence-forth studies his owne preservation, but sees no part of his native home-glance any happi∣nesse, but every where horror and destruction: his genius therefore prompts him to adventures, yea to hast aboard: in some remote place or other to establish his present state and future happinesse; no shew of feare, no improbability in reason, no peradventures any whit disaminating his well-temper'd spirit, to Sea therfore he meant to go and prepares speedily: for at that instant hee saw that Prophetique song penned by <HI>Ambrose Te∣leyssen</HI> a noble Bardh fulfilled; writ in the yeere 490, such time as <HI>Aurelius Ambrosius,</HI> brother to <HI>Vther-pen-Dragon</HI> arrived here (from <HI>Armorica</HI>) to re∣venge them upon the uncivill Saxons: the Bardh vaticinating that when they fell to Idolatry, to discord, or to admit strange people among them, that then the Brittish glory should be Eclipsed.</P>

day in danger: all things therefore being fitted, he put to Sea without bid∣ding his kindred farewell, least too much love or hate might have with∣drawne him. The yeere he set forth in, was from <HI>Adam</HI> 5140. from <HI>Christ</HI> 1170. the wind and sea seemed to favour him (Omens of good fortune:) so as, after some patience and weeks saile due West, hee descried land, a land where he found store of good victualls, sweet water, fresh ayre, gold, (and which was best) where they were a good whiles healthfull: such, as over-whelmed him with joy, but moderated when he considered how Almighty God was alike powerfull and gratious in all places: his exile now turned into comfort. In leiw of ingeminating his owne misery, hee joyes himselfe, and sees his brothers most unhappy Princes; who so eagerly emulated one anothers greatnesse: a Territory causing it, which compa∣red which this, God had directed him to, was but as a handfull of earth, and which he had had possession of without opposition or bloodshed. Here <HI>Madoc</HI> planted (in <HI>Florida</HI> or <HI>Canada,</HI> some part of <HI>Mexico</HI>) rais'd some fortificati∣ons for defence, left a hundred and twenty men (I follow the old Copie, in this Storie) and directly by Gods providence (the best compasse) and benefit of the Pole starre after long saile arrived safely at home; where, hee recounted his mervailous succesfull voyage, the fruitfulnesse of the soile, the simplicity of the Savages, the great wealth abounding there, and facility of Conquest: a discourse that fill'd them with joy and admiration; and whereby hee drew many willing minds to returne with him. In ten good Barques, loaded with all necessary provisions they advanced back, and most fortunately re-attained the same place they hoped for. Great re∣joycing was among them at that their happinesse, but no lesse sorrow fol∣lowed: for, being come to the Plantation, they found few of those they left there, living: caused by too much eating, the indisposition or Novel∣ty of that ayre arid climate, (which though never so excellent, yet causes sicknesse and alteration in new Inhabitants) by some trecherie of the Bar∣barians. <HI>Madoc</HI> digested it with a Christian fortitude and patience, and forth-with bettered the Colony, by help of <HI>Eneon</HI> and <HI>Edwall</HI> his brothers Contriving every thing with so good order, that they were secure from any Enemie, and had all things conducing to ease, plenty, and contented∣nesse: they threw away the too indulgent thoughts of their Native homes, by this reason, that if they died there, they were in the same distance from heaven, and had as easie a journey thither: what most afflicted them was the breach of promise, many of their friends had made but not performed. The cause was not in them, but in the overture of that state turn'd topsie∣turvie by the <HI>Brittaine</HI> Princes, and totally by the indiscretion of that un∣happy Prince <HI>Lluellyn ap Gryffith,</HI> (lately married to <HI>Eleoner,</HI> daughter of <HI>Monteford</HI> the bold Earle of <HI>Lecester</HI> and <HI>Eleoner</HI> daughter of King <HI>Iohn</HI>) which <HI>Gruffyth</HI> was slaine <HI>Anno</HI> 1282 at <HI>Buelht</HI> by <HI>Franckton</HI> an English∣man in an unmanly fashion. So that <HI>Madoc</HI> and his Company returned no more, nor did the Welsh saile thither afterward, whereby one of another in small time were in some sort forgotten and never remembred.</P>
<P>But although <HI>Madoc</HI> and his Cambrian crew are dead and their memo∣ry moath-eaten; yet the foot-steeps and reliques of their former living there are to be traced; and such, as deserve to be revived clearly: the lan∣guage

they left there, the religion they taught the Savages, manifested it; otherwise how come those many Brittish words (not much altred from the dialect) amongst the Mexicans? whence had they the use of Beads, of Crucifixes, of Reliques &amp;c? all which the Spaniards (as we tcad in <HI>Lopez de Gomera</HI> and others) confesse they found amongst the Canibals, and those of <HI>Acusano,</HI> and <HI>Culhuacan</HI> at their first landing in <HI>America.</HI> Yea, some tra∣dition and reports amongst the Mexicans, that (about the time that <HI>Madoc</HI> was there) a strange people came thither in Corraughs or Ships, who taught them some knowledge of God, and by whose examples they became more civill and industrious: testified by <HI>Columbus, Franciscus Lopez, Coz∣tezo, Postellus</HI> and other Castilians of quality; that of <HI>Fernando Cortez,</HI> (<HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1519 Ambassador and Generall for <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabell</HI>) is also remarkable. In some discourse betwixt him and <HI>Mutezuma</HI> (second sonne of <HI>Antzol,</HI> and Father of <HI>Quabutimoc</HI> last King of <HI>Mexico,</HI>) the Ambassador observing the Indians to have many ceremonies the Spaniards used, demanded of the King who first instructed them, who answered <HI>Cor∣tez;</HI> That many yeeres ago a strange Nation landed there, a civill people, and from examples of piety they received them; but how they were cal∣led, or whence they came he could not satisfie him. Another time, in an Oration of thanks which <HI>Mutezuma</HI> returned them for some favours, hee thus told them. One chiefe cause of my especiall affection to your Nati∣on is this, I have many times heard my Father say, hee heard his Grandsire seriously affirme (out of a continued tradition) That not many Descents above him, his Progenitors came thither as strangers by accident, in com∣pany of a Noble man, who abode there a while and then departed, but left many of his people behind him; and that upon his returne, most of those he left, died: and that from him or some of them they thought they themselves discended. A speech agreeing with our Narration: and that this people were Welsh rather than Spaniards, or others, the Records of this voyage writ by many Bardhs and Genealogists confirme it; memoriz'd also by those learned Poets <HI>Cynwric op Grono</HI> and <HI>Guten Owen</HI> (who lived in <HI>Edward</HI> the fourths time) and by Sir <HI>Meredith ap Reese</HI> a valiant and lear∣ned man, living in the yeare 1477. and of <HI>Madoc</HI> in this Eulogie.

proofes of what I wish were generally allowed of. Nor is it a phantasie of yesterday, many worthy men of late and antient times have revived it: such are <HI>Cynwrie ap Grono, Meredith ap Rhyce, Guten Owen, Lloyd, Powell, Pris, Hackluit, Bronghton, Purchas, Davys,</HI> &amp;c. Enough to satisfie the wel∣willers of truth; too mush foe Zollists and such as delight in opposition. This, no doubt had it beene so deservedly knowne and Catholiquely be∣eeved as it merited; then had not <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> (a man in truth, honourable and idustrious) <HI>Americus Vespusius, Magellan,</HI> nor others ca∣ried along with them all the honour in so great an enterprise: Nor had Prince <HI>Madoc</HI> beene defrauded of his memory, nor our Kings of their just right and Title to the West Indyes (a secret fate as it were miraculously renuing their claime by <HI>Columbus</HI> his proffering the discoverie and wealth of those Countries to our King <HI>H.</HI> 7.) nor then had his Holinesse, nor his Catholique Majestie had that plea nor immediate Interest grounded upon the Genoans discovery, as many Jesuits and State-politiques have so ve∣hemently, so late disputed for. Farre be it from me or any honest man to detract <HI>Columbus,</HI> or to derogate from his deserved glory: It may be his discovery was (as <HI>Madocks</HI> was) meerely from his owne skill, genius, and magnanimity, without knowledge of <HI>Madocks</HI> former being there, or of en∣couragement from old conjectures: his greatest reason I know, was that so much of the 360 degrees could scarce be Ocean &amp; that he might as well discover Westward as the Portugalls had done East to the other Indies. But this I would withall have also granted; That this his voyage was after the other (of our Country-man) three hundred and two &amp; twenty yeares; and that the Spaniards have not so much right to those Countries (I meane of <HI>America</HI>) as our King has; so long as they arrogate their claime from a primier discovery.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> was borne at <HI>Gugureo</HI> (at <HI>Nervi</HI> some say) not far from <HI>Genoa:</HI> a man of a modest nature, studious, and well read in the Mathematiques: and of that, chiefly in Navigation: His first encouragement of going West upon discovery, grew (as say the Spaniards) from his perusing an Ephe∣merides writ by a Spanish Mariner, who had beene forced into the West Indies by tempest, and died at <HI>Columbus</HI> his house upon his arrivall: this is a Spanish lye, invented meerely to derogate from his worth, and that an Italian should not master so much glory. Whither <HI>Columbus</HI> had any illu∣mination from old Poets, or that he had seene or heard of <HI>Madocks</HI> journey Westward, who knowes: for, what Nation formerly knew not the acts of English-men better than themselves: otherwise, <HI>Polidore Virgil</HI> that craf∣tie Monck had not andertooke to illustrate (to his and our shame) the English Cronologie, nor <HI>Verstegan</HI> (alias <HI>Rowley</HI>) dar'd to make us all Teu∣tonicks; from both which wee suck to many egregious falshoods. <HI>Co∣lumbus</HI> armed with much confidence, sends his brother to our King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, the wisest in his time and most noble, if too much avarice had not swayed him: whose ill hap it was to slight the Messenger and his Mes∣sage, from his incredulous heart and the poverty of <HI>Columbus,</HI> who in his passage had been imprisoned by Rescalls, and nakedly (after much intreaty) delivered. Upon the Kings refusall, he desired the French King to Patro∣nize it, but hee (hearing that King <HI>Henry</HI> had refused) derided him; who
<PB N="362" REF="186" MS="y"/>
had beene for ever discouraged, had not <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Spanish King (af∣ter long suit) accepted of the motion, and trusted him with two hundred men in two small Ships, at the earnest snit of <HI>Iohn Perez de Marchena,</HI> at that time Rector of the Monasterie of <HI>Rabida,</HI> a great Mecenas to industri∣ous men: with which, after threescore dayessaile, much impatience, and no lesse stirre to quiet the discontented Spaniards, <HI>Columbus</HI> descried land, that part call'd <HI>Guanahami,</HI> but by <HI>Colon</HI> new nam'd Saint <HI>Salvador,</HI> a part of <HI>Mexico,</HI> (very neere where <HI>Madoc</HI> had first landed;) a discovery no lesse joying them, than as if thereby they had got the Conquest and Em∣pire of all the world: a Prize so worthy, that from that yeare 1492 to this, they have brought home no lesse gold and silver, than all <HI>Europe</HI> enjoyed formerly. <HI>Columbus</HI> died in the yeare 1506, in his fourth returne out of the Indyes.
