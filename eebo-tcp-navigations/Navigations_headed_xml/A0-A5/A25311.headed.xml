<HEAD>THE AMOURS OF THE Sultana of <HI>Barbary.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The First Part.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>CMAT</HI> (the Grand Signior) who succeed∣ed <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. was the best-made Man in his whole Empire. He was tall, had a goodly Meen, full of Majesty and Grandeur; his Eyes were black, large, and roll'd with a sparkling Fire: The Air of his Face was noble and commanding.
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y"/>and whenever he spoke, it softned in∣to a thousand Sweetnesses; His Soul was much more agreeable than his Person, though it was a receiv'd opi∣nion, it was not to his Quality he owed the number of those that called him the goodliest Man that had been formed. He was exactly made for a great Lover and a fine Gentleman; his Success amongst the Ladies made it evident, and the care he took to make his Court to the fair Sex had been seldom in vain.</P>
<P><HI>Indamora,</HI> by him created Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> had found how to fix his Heart; for though he had continued some years amorous of the fair <HI>Ho∣mira,</HI> to whom he gave the Title of Sultana, yet had a thousand Passions intervened, and she was constrained to suffer Rivals; yet she retained the Sovereignity, and the great <HI>Acmat</HI> held himself obliged to be constant to none but her; till Time, which perfects all things, let him see that <HI>Homira</HI> did not deserve so much from him, and that <HI>Amurath,</HI> a private
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>Gentleman, but beautiful as an Angel; possest the favourable Inclinations of that Sultana, whilest the Sultan had nothing but her Person, and that too but in part.</P>
<P>She was tall, and had an unexpres∣sible Grandeur accompanied all she did; her Eyes were beyond the power of being defined, her whole Features admirable, and one of the finest made Faces that had perhaps ever been seen. She deserved the Epithet of a great Beauty, and exceeded what is pro∣perly called so.</P>
<P>'Tis a truth, she had loved the Sul∣tan before he was so; but Ambition, which was her predominant Passion, (whilest she yet set some bounds to her Luxury) did not permit her to tell it him; but as soon as Destiny had determined the Fate of <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. and that <HI>Acmat</HI> was actual Possessor of the Ottoman Empire, she made appear that the first day he could call the Scepter his, she became his also.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P><HI>Acmat</HI> very well saw he owed the Possession of the Person of <HI>Homira</HI> (though not to her Inclinations) to his Crowns; and though he was ac∣customed never to let those niceties disturb him, yet he could have wisht she had not let the World see she gave the Monarch what she denied the Lo∣ver, since it carried this disadvantage with it, an encouragement to all that adored her. It was very well seen her transporting desires to please her self; she was extream sensual, and sacrifi∣ced all things to Pleasure; her Am∣bition was crowned, and all she en∣deavours is to persuade the Grand Signior of her tenderness, and to gra∣tifie her Inclinations.</P>
<P>But that Restraint which she for some years had put upon them, on purpose to secure the Esteem of the Sultan, she began to grow weary of; and she abandoned her self to almost all the vast number that adored her.</P>
<P>The Sultan, who passionately lov'd her, passed over Faults too gross for any to continue in his favour that had
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y"/>been guilty of them, and was, beyond her expectation, (infinitely beyond her deserts) indulgent, would be∣lieve nothing to her disadvantage, and if he at all minded her of her ill conduct, it was after a manner so obliging as if he believed she could do nothing that deserved reproving.</P>
<P>It was much about this time when the young <HI>Amurath</HI> came to Court. He had received from the Sultan that extream Grace, to kiss the Hand of the Sultana Queen; he came to her Appartments in the <HI>Seraglio</HI> in order to it. The Queen was not yet come into the Chamber of Presence. <HI>Ho∣mira</HI> attended her there; and when the young <HI>Amurath</HI> appeared, she presently had designs upon his Heart. As for what concerned him, he was wholly amazed to see a Woman so perfectly beautiful as <HI>Homira:</HI> She was dress'd gloriously, and in so at∣tractive a manner, that <HI>Amurath,</HI> ha∣stily advancing, fell before her on his Knees, and treated her as if he had believed her the Sultana Queen,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>(by the Majesty of her Meen.) This so very well satisfied <HI>Homira</HI>'s humour, that she was going to say something very obliging to him, when that the Sultana Queen entring prevented her: She withdrew from the presence; and <HI>Amurath</HI> (when he came to Court, came with a design to establish an in∣terest there,) followed her as soon as he had ended his Court to the Sulta∣na Queen.</P>
<P>This mistake made a great noise, and was much for <HI>Amurath</HI>'s Advan∣tage, <HI>Homira</HI> not much valuing a dis∣creet Lover, but a passionate and a brave: 'tis true, he ran the risque of the Sultan's displeasure, but he was of opinion he ought to do no less, before he could be called to the pos∣session of so beautiful a Princess as <HI>Homira.</HI> He believed Writing to her was what he ought to do, and in that Consideration he sent her this Letter.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5" MS="y"/>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>IF the Mistake I made was for my disadvantage, consider, if you please, fair</HI> Homira, <HI>if you are not a Queen, 'tis an Injustice done to your Merit; ac∣cuse cruel Fortune, and not</HI> Amurath, <HI>who, were it in his power, would not de∣lay making what he then believed you. Let me conjure you, fair Sultana, to permit me speak with you this Evening at your own Appartments; for never was there one more adored you, (or more passionately desired you to live with me as if you were assured of it) than</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Amurath.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Considering the Fame <HI>Homira</HI> had in the world, this Letter was not writ with too much precaution; but she was of a great Quality (having mar∣ried a very noble Turk) before she had the Title of Sultana, which her being Mistress to the Grand Signior acquired her, had she been less kind she had certainly been just to her Mo∣narch; but her inclinations were fa∣vourable,
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>and her Ruin inevitable. She received the Letter with an un∣expressible Joy, and with her accu∣stomed manner of Writing when she designs to oblige, she made this return.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>YOur mistake was for me too glorious, and too advantagious to you to ex∣pect any thing besides Acknowledgment; you were not formed ever to be disappoint∣ed in any thing you desire: The Sultan leaves me at</HI> 10 <HI>a Clock; I will then ex∣pect you, to assure you, nor your Conduct nor your Person has displeased</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Homira.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Amurath</HI> failed not to be at the Assignation at the pointed hour; he found the Sultana as meltingly kind as she had been to a great many others, but <HI>Amurath</HI> is more happy than all; she will abandon those she before treated favourably, and will give her self up entirely to her Sultan and her dear <HI>Amurath.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="6" MS="y"/>
<P>Whilest <HI>Homira</HI> had thus dispo∣sed of her self, <HI>Mustapha,</HI> Brother to the Sultan, (matchless for Valour and Conduct) returned from gaining a glorious Victory. His Success was a∣lone derived from his Governing; and never was a great Prince a bet∣ter Soldier: He had early all the ex∣perience of a brave General, and ne∣ver could the great <HI>Acmat</HI> commit the Sasety and the Glory of his Em∣pires to a better Manager. Success constantly followed all his Designs, and it was said of him <HI>He was the best of Soldiers and the best of Subjects;</HI> nor did his warlike humour render him unfit for other things, he was a great Courtier and a great States∣man. <HI>Homira</HI> believed it her Interest to make him hers; she employed all her Cunning to effect it, and though at first she only designed him her Friend, she at length (maugre her Passion for <HI>Amurath,</HI> and common Policy) resolved him her Lover. It was impossible for her to fail, when she endeavoured any thing of that na∣ture;
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>yet the Prince was easily ore∣come with an opinion of her Love to him, and her dazling Charms: He took her to his Arms, and suffered himself to bury there the reflection of the Crime he committed in injuring a Brother such as <HI>Acmat</HI> (and in such a sensible manner.) In all probabi∣lity <HI>Mustapha</HI> had ever loved her, had he not learned by some what a Repu∣tation she had. His Inclinations are virtuous, and he could not endure to see himself fond of a Woman that de∣served rather Contempt. He lost his steem for her, and was seeking for some Pretext to break with her with∣out her seeing he desired it: He be∣lieved it was best the Quarrel should begin on her part, but whilest he is at a loss how to give her an occasion of it, as if undesignedly, there was an accident fell out that ever after made her his Enemy.</P>
<P>He was once in her Cabinet, and caressing her with all the sweetness imaginable, and on the point of re∣ceiving some testimonies of her Pas∣sion,
<PB N="11" REF="7" MS="y"/>when the Sultan entred. <HI>Mu∣stapha</HI> was surprized, and in a confu∣sed manner retired. <HI>Aomat</HI> was ex∣treamly disordered: He did not ex∣pect to find a Rival in the Prince his Brother; he said little to the Sulta∣na, but retired ill-humoured and irre∣solved.</P>
<P><HI>Mustapha</HI> saw his Ruin inevitable, but endeavours must be used to pre∣vent it, if possible: Either the Prince or the Sultana must be disgraced. It was easy to be resolved who ought to suffer. <HI>Mustapha</HI> hated an ill Action, and yet unwilling as he was to sacri∣fice <HI>Homira,</HI> he acknowledged her un∣worthy a place in the Sultan's esteem, (how then one so large as she possest in his heart?) He calls to his aid <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa, Grand Visier, who had raised <HI>Homira</HI> to what she was; the Title of Sultana was given at his Desire; she had promised him her Favours if he could procure it for her. He was passionately in Love, and did what she commanded; she is the
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>Sultana <HI>Homira,</HI> but very treacherous; she denies to reward his Love and his Care, contemns him, and in a word uses him so, that from her passionate Lover he became her most mortal E∣nemy. <HI>Amurath</HI> had been brought to Court by him, with a design to ruin this ungrateful: He had placed Spies on all her Actions, and was extream∣ly pleased, he could save <HI>Mustapha</HI> from ruin by exposing her. He bids the Prince endeavour his own safety; that if he were so fatally generous as to offer his own Life for ransoming a faithless Womans, after such a Sa∣crifice she would but triumph over his Weakness. In short, he disposes the Prince to a Preservation of him∣self. He was once informed by the Grand visier, that <HI>Amurath</HI> was then with <HI>Homira, Mahomet</HI> Bassa tells him, that he ought not to neglect so favourable an opportunity of reconciling himself to the Sul∣tan: <HI>Mustapha</HI> goes then to the great <HI>Acmat,</HI> lets him see how ill he did to disgrace him for an in∣famous
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>Woman, and pursuing that Point, brought the Grand Signior to listen to him at length, and fol∣lowing that Advantage, with ano∣ther, made him pass to the Sulta∣na's Lodgings, where <HI>Amurath</HI> was found with <HI>Homira,</HI> in a place the Sultan allowed none besides him∣self to be in.</P>
<P>She being thus discovered, cast her self at the feet of her injured Mo∣narch, but he was too sensibly touched at her perfidiousness, to be moved at any thing she could say or do: He left her drowned in despair, in anger and Grief, he carried <HI>Mustapha</HI> with him from her Apartments, and began there to acquiesce with the Prince, and blame himself for loving an infamous Woman, and one that abandoned her self to all sorts of Criminal and Scan∣dalous Passions; his Resentments ter∣minated in having no more esteem for <HI>Homira,</HI> and in disgracing <HI>Amu∣rath.</HI></P>
<PB N="14" REF="9" MS="y"/>
<P>The Grand Visier was revenged on the Sultana <HI>Homira,</HI> the Sultan has left loving her, and, to all appearance, has intirely abandoned her, but he was not assured he should do so for ever; <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa was acquainted perfect∣ly with his Humour, he forgets Inju∣ries the soonest of any Man alive, and might, perhaps, in favour of <HI>Homira,</HI> lose the Remembrance of her Infamy. But <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa will prevent that by all the ways can be thought on, there is a very fair Christian Slave ta∣ken, he ransoms her, and places her with the Sultana Queen, in a Station so advantageous for his Designs, that as often as the Sultan came out of that side, he must of necessity see her; she was of a good Stature, finely shaped, prettily turn'd and Gentile, her Face little, but all over Charms, fine sweet Eyes, a pretty Mouth, good Teeth, and an Air so peculiar to herself, that tho' Detraction had very little to say of the rest, yet that engaged beyond all things, so innocently sweet, so guiltless of Cunning and design, and
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>yet none has more than she, that the Sultan would often say, she was a Miracle in nature; he loses his Li∣berty as soon as he sees her; he em∣ploys <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa to tell her of the Conquest, and that she might be as∣sured the Ottoman Emperor was rea∣dy to lay his Crowns at her Feet, (as great a Monarch as he was,) if she commanded it.</P>
<P>The Grand Visier was full of Joy at the Success that attended his Designs; he will know the History, and the Qua∣lity, the Merit, as well as the Beauty, of his Captive, before he puts his In∣terest with hers; not but the Sultan's Approbation and Passion for her was enough to secure him; but he will know if he finds her ready to follow all he shall advise, if she will, then he is the absolute Monarch of the Sultan, since it was the Humour of that Mo∣narch to let himself be govern'd by the Woman he loves, the Grand Vi∣sier believes it necessary for his De∣signs, that he should be acquainted
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>with the Life of <HI>Indamora,</HI> (for so was the fair Christian call'd,) she had confusedly related to him some of the particulars when he first ransomed her, but that does not satisfie, he goes to her then, conjures her to give him that Satisfaction, since he assured her it was for both their Interests, he should be ignorant of nothing that concerned her; after some Excuses and Denials, she assents, and gives him this following Relation.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="17" REF="10" MS="y"/>
<HEAD><HI>The History of</HI> Indamora.</HEAD>
<P>YOu persuade me, my Lord, by so powerful a way, that I must resolve to make you acquainted with all my Weaknesses: To begin then, I am the Daughter of a <HI>German,</HI> my Father was more obliged to the Gifts of Nature, than those of Fortune; however, he was a good Gentleman, and lived esteemed by all, his Humour retired, and we, in complaisance to it, shared his Solitude with him: I will not tell you I was naturally pleas∣ed with it, but since I saw no way to get my self out of it, I acquiesced.</P>
<P>I had not long lived in an Age ca∣pable of distinguishing things of such a nature, when I became in Love with <HI>Alcander,</HI> one of the most Illustrious of the Kingdom, and Son to the Em∣peror's Sister, who had married her self to one of her Brothers Subjects; her unfortunate Marriage was never
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>forgiven her, but oppress'd with the fatal Anger of his Imperial Majesty: She died full of Royal Grief and Sor∣row, in Travail with <HI>Alcander;</HI> him she had espoused loved her too ten∣derly to survive her long, but, after having mourned her loss, he followed her in a very little time. <HI>Alcander</HI> be∣ing thus left to the Mercy of an in∣censed King, was, in all appearance, to run a most deplorable Fortune; but the Emperor's Anger being dead with his Sister, the Princess, ordered a great Care should be taken of the Royal Orphan, and gave command to have him brought up and educated as his own Son, loaded him with Titles, and, as soon as he was capable of them, he gave him great Employs. I am going to tell you how it was I first saw him, which was almost admirable in a Life so retired, so free from Court as mine: He was a fine Man, well shaped, of a good height, when I first knew him, which was when he was very young, his Soul was extreme Amorous, had a great share of Inconstancy; but where
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>he loved, it was with the greatest fer∣vency imaginable; the Emperor was Hunting one day in a Wood joyning our House, which was seated very com∣modious for that sort of Diversion, <HI>Alcander</HI> was then with him, and ha∣ving seen me at a great Window I had thrown open for the better seeing the Court pass; he seem'd not displeased with me, but alighting from his Horse hastily, he caused himself to be con∣ducted by my Servants to the place where I was; 'tis not easie to define the Surprize this Action gave me; however, I was infinitely charmed with his good Meen, his Wit, and his Address; he found my Inclinations did not agree with that sort of Life, he talk'd tenderly, I was in an Age wherein I believed all that fell from his inchanting Tongue was true; I be∣gan to feel a Passion for him, and, af∣ter he had a thousand times sighed for my sake in one hour, I was sensible of a pleasing Fire he had inspired me with; I gave way for him to endea∣vour the bringing me to Court, which
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>he conjured me to agree to; and, when he retired, after a many Protestations of Admiration, <HI>he bad me be assured, I had in him not only a great Friend, but a great Lover:</HI> This Confession drew some Blushes from me. But the fol∣lowing day he came again to visit me, then it was I lost my Liberty, for in that fatal hour I made no difficulty to own I loved him; I valued not to be discreet, there is no such thing in Love, but I made it all the Business of my Life to be ever telling him my Passion. I saw all his Actions with Pleasure, there was an agreeable Inchantment in them, I repined not at the freedom I had lost, nor to have been as great as Heaven is high, would have been unacquainted with him again. It was thus agreeably I passed some of my Life; nor envied I Monarchs in my re∣tirement, when e're <HI>Alcander</HI> shared it with me; but as the place I lived in was so distant from the Court, that <HI>Alcander</HI>'s Attendance on the Empe∣ror prevented him from seeing me as often as he desired, he placed me with
<PB N="21" REF="12" MS="y"/>the Archdutchess his Imperial Maje∣sties Daughter; I was with her in a very glorious Station, and though in a place where all sorts of Diversion were in use, I esteemed it but as it gave me the greater Liberty to see <HI>Al∣cander;</HI> and, to often assure him of my Passion, I writ it to him, I told it to him in a Language tender and mo∣ving; I easily believed all this would satisfie him, but when he had seen to what a height my Passion soared, and that he was dearer a thousand times to me than I had ever been to him, he triumph'd over my Weak∣ness, and, losing all manner of Re∣spect, by the opinion he had I could deny him nothing, he courted me for my undoing; I received the first cruel Proposals of my ruin with a terrible Emotion, and with such Disdain, that <HI>Alcander</HI> durst not urge me further; but the following day sent me this Letter.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>YOU are certainly the falsest of all Wo∣men; How is it you tell me you Love me, and yet use me as if I was the remotest Man in all your Kindness? Is it your part to pretend to Virtue, and I know not what fantastical</HI> Chimera's, <HI>and at the same moment tell me you know how to Love well? Ah!</HI> Indamora, <HI>change these barbarous Sentiments, and assure your self I will never see you again, whilst you continue in them: I had much rather live for ever from you, without hope, than live for ever with you, and not dare to tell you, you must consider nor endeavour nothing, but how to please the Man you say has all your Tenderness.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>I swooned at the reading of this Letter, and was just recovered as <HI>Al∣cander</HI> entered; he flew to me, and, receiving me in his Arms, he whisper∣ed so many fatal, poysoning, charming Things, that I had no longer the power to be angry with him; he pro∣tested he could not see me, and not desire to be the happiest Man Breath∣ing,
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>when it was in the Power of a Woman, that loved him, to make him so: I know not, Love is an unaccounta∣ble Madness, I dreaded, of all things, the never seeing him more, it was that Consideration vanquish'd me, (and, oh Gods!) in that fatal moment I pro∣mised and appointed him the following day, he seem'd transported at the Grant, he bless'd the Heavens, the Gods and me, and retired with so much Joy, that the Pleasure I took in pleasing him, surmounted all my other Fears; and I, in short, resolved to make him that happy Man he said, though at the expence of my own Ease, and the Joy of my coming Life; I ve∣ry well saw I gave him what I should eternally repent of, but those in Love have no Consideration, but what is agreeable to that Passion; but though I had abandoned all the Care of my self, the Gods retained theirs for me, and saved my Honour then, from dy∣ing in the Arms of <HI>Alcander.</HI> I was to attend that night the Archdutchess to a great Ball the Empress made, af∣ter
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>it was ended, and that the Compa∣ny began to be more chosen, the Prince told her Imperial Majesty a Story to divert her, so like that I had with <HI>Al∣cander,</HI> that I knew not what to do to hide my Confusion; it was of one of the Women of Quality, and the Em∣peror's youngest Son; the Prince had ruined and exposed her, and very bar∣barously suffered the Prince of <HI>Germa∣ny</HI> his Brother, to divert the Empress with the recital of the Amour; the Lady was so extremely condemn'd by all that were present, that I then took Resolutions quite contrary to those before; I saw, (by a kind of Mira∣cle,) how much a Woman's Honor and Virtue ought to be esteemed above all things, and in the Assurance I could ever continue in the same Opinion, I writ this Note to <HI>Alcander.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>The Archdutchess has commanded me to attend her to morrow at the same time I appointed you; there is no Denials to be made her, it is not after that manner she must be treated. Adieu, and believe I Love you above every thing, but the de∣sire I have to make you happy.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>
<P>I was constrained to use Dissimula∣tion; I was really meritorious of pity; I loved <HI>Alcander,</HI> and could not live without telling it him; I believed I could ever pretend Business, and by that continue my self dear to him, since it should appear wholly out of my Power to gratifie him: Had I been less in Love, I should have taken Re∣solutions very different from these; I would have learn'd him a design I had then entertained, of never seeing him again, if I could not do it without pre∣judicing my Honor and Virtue; but I, all Passion, could not bear a Separati∣on so cruel, but lull'd him on with false hopes, and promised him all, without a design to perform any thing.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander</HI> believed nothing of my Ex∣cuse, and thought I had only broke my Promise, because I had no mind to keep it; he would, however, come to the Lodgings of the Archdutchess, where he was satisfied I was gone; we met in the great Antichamber, <HI>How do you use me!</HI> said he softly to me; <HI>you Love me little, or Duty had not thus
<PB N="26" REF="15" MS="y"/>prevailed; you see me here by the Orders of my Princess.</HI> Replied I unconcernedly, <HI>But are you not satisfied I attend her when she commands it; you take little Care,</HI> persued I, <HI>of any but your self; Do not you see, if I had disobeyed, the reason I should have had for it would have been inquired into; and in a Court, like this, a great deal of Pre∣caution sometimes avails but little; those in my Circumstances cannot be careful enough. Ah!</HI> interrupted <HI>Alcander,</HI> with a profound Sigh, <HI>You talk as if you did not Love me; I very well see with how much Faithlesness you have used me; it is not my Fault, if I am re∣venged, nor can you be angry at it.</HI> He retired here, with a gloomy Melan∣choly; and I, quitting the Apart∣ments of the Archdutchess, came to my own, sunk in Grief and in despair; I put my self to Bed, had it given out I was ill, and accordingly I was visited on the morrow; amongst those that came to see me, the Chief of the Religious made one, by that place he had the Title of a Prince; he was
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>not at all made for Ecclesiastical Af∣fairs, but it being one of the greatest Place in the Kingdom, the Emperor bestowed it on <HI>Tiridate Agustus,</HI> ex∣tremely in his Favour; this Prince ha∣ving Authority from the Place, he possessed, to do almost any thing, staid till the rest of the Company was all retired, and throwing himself on his Knees by my Bed, he proceeded thus, <HI>You ought not to wonder, fair</HI> Indamora, <HI>at the Confession of my Passion; I am on the point of making you; I have very long loved you, but I very well knew, the un∣grateful</HI> Alcander <HI>had alone all your Ten∣derness, and, in a word, the Possession of your Heart. Yes, Madam, I am now encouraged, since he no longer merits any thing, but scorn and contempt from you: He has, like a Villain, given me all your Letters, with a Command to tell you, he is no longer yours; and that all the Fa∣vour ever he desires of you, is to burn those you have of his, that the World might not be a Witness of his Passion, for an un∣grateful and a faithless Woman. But,</HI> continued the Prince, seeing me all in
<PB N="28" REF="16"/>Tears, <HI>'tis he alone is the ingrateful and perfidious; I esteem you too much, to let you persevere in an Engagement with one so undeserving and barbarous; and,</HI> con∣tinuing with a great Sigh, and an extraordinary emotion of Passion, <HI>had it been to</HI> Agustus <HI>the Divine</HI> Indamora <HI>had given those Favours, there should no∣thing have exacted a Confession from him, I know better what is due to my God and my Fair,</HI> &amp;c. He accompanied these last words with so many Marks of a great Passion, that I, enraged with <HI>Alcander,</HI> and pleased with the Person and the Tenderness of the Prince, suffered him to continue; he believed my si∣lence was advance enough, and took so much Incouragement from it, as to ask for himself what I had denied <HI>Al∣cander;</HI> I was so enraged at that Faith∣less Man, that I believed I could re∣venge my self no way so perfectly, as by favouring <HI>Agustus</HI> beyond him; it was this consideration made me give the Prince whatever he could desire; 'tis very true, I had in my Arms a Man infinitely agreeable, so made to charm
<PB N="29" REF="16"/>a Woman's Heart, that none, but I, could have denied him mine, but the hour was not yet come that he should possess that. I still loved <HI>Alcander,</HI> and must look on him as the cause of all my Ruin; it was, to be revenged on him, that I abandoned my Honor, and suffered my self to be undone by a Man I then only esteem'd; 'tis true, had I never seen <HI>Alcander,</HI> I should have loved <HI>Agustus,</HI> but the Prince had no∣thing of my Tenderness, though he possess'd, and, in a word, enjoy'd me.</P>
<P>It was thus we lived for some time, I continued my feigned Indisposition, and the Prince augmented his Passion, and his Care, for me; he very well saw he had not yet my Love, he used all his Address to gain it; I made all he did agreeable to me, and began to see, I should be ungrateful, if I conti∣nued to deny him my Heart; what I had done in an opinion it would en∣rage <HI>Alcander,</HI> I, too late, found proved quite contrary; and if I will believe a Letter with his Name, which
<PB N="30" REF="17"/>I received, you shall see by it he was pleased with my favouring the Prince.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>Could you imagin, inconstant, faith∣less,</HI> Indamora, <HI>that I ever took your De∣nials for a Virtue? No, the event has let me see, nothing is impossible; the Prince, after I had acquainted him with my just Quarrel against you, confess'd himself in Love; I have a great deal of Friendship, and very easily promised him my Assistance, I gave him all your Letters, bid him employ them to his best Advantage, and, in short, endeavour to be more happy than I could be. You know the rest, Madam, I have only to assure you, I am extremly satisfied at the good Fortune of my Friend, and conjure you to believe, that I am so.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>I gave this Letter to the Prince to read, and, extremly enraged at the discovering to his Friend my favouring of him, commanded him to retire, and see me no more, till I could be reconciled to him; I removed from the Court, for some short time, under pretext of change of Air; I took up a Resolution of never believing, what a Man could say again, but resolved,
<PB N="31" REF="17"/>with my self, to use them all as ill as they had done me, and return'd full of the designs; but I cannot tell, how I altered; the Prince had often writ to assure me of his Passion, and im∣plore my Pardon; I was really dis∣pleased with him, but the extreme Graces of his Soul, and his Person, inclined me to some pity for him, and, at length, to a sense of Tenderness; I pardoned him, and transported him with it, he certainly loved me, for ne∣ver was one more fuller of Joy, to be reconciled to me, and I stedfastly be∣lieved, had not the Law forbid him to the contrary, I should have become his Wife. Mean time I saw <HI>Alcander</HI> in publick Places, and it grew very difficult for me judge, which I loved best, the Prince or him; I found I could live without his Conversation, which before I could never have be∣lieved; his sullen Humor was one of his greatest Graces, and gloomy and Melancholy as he was, when I appear∣ed, served as no disadvantage to him.</P>
<P><HI>Tiridate Agustus</HI> was, by the Empe∣ror,
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>commanded from Court about some private Business, that employ'd him two months; he deplored his Ab∣sence from me very often in his Let∣ters, which were always writ in a Style so tender and moving, that I was almost as much charmed with them, as with his Person.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander</HI> could yet see by my Acti∣ons, which I did not at all manage, that the Love I had for him was only abated, not extinct, he began to find, how much he was to blame in being so ca∣pricious, he would endeavour to again obtain my Pardon, he believed it no longer so difficult to possess, what I had before denied him, the Prince had conquered me, and <HI>Alcander</HI> did not doubt Success; he knows the greatest Art consisted in a Reconciliation, he considers my Passion for him, as a pow∣erful step, he will make use of it, and follows me one Evening into a close green Arbor in the Gardens, joyning the Archdutchess's Apartment; as soon as he was entered, he threw him∣self at my Feet, and, hiding his Face
<PB N="31" REF="18"/>out of Shame and Respect, he pro∣tested he should never dare to look on me again, till I gave him some assu∣rance by my Pardon; I saw at my Feet a Man, I loved, melting into Tender∣ness and Sorrow, for having offended me; had I followed the Laws of Pas∣sion, I had forgiven him, but when I had more cruel Reflections, and that I thought I was obliged to consider him as no other but as one that had inhumanly betray'd me, and been ac∣cessary to my ruin, I rose up, with some Emotions of Anger, in a Reso∣lution of quitting the Arbor; but oh, Heavens! how weak are those in Love, I sunk into his Arms, and could not have strength enough to retire, I gave him my Pardon e're he could again ask it of me; he seem'd transported at the Favour, he denied that cruel. Letter I received from him, and, as a Testi∣mony to the contrary, assured me, he had ever loved me; he maliciously told me, it could proceed from none but the Prince, who had certainly the design in it, to prevent my Reconci∣liation
<PB N="34" REF="19"/>with <HI>Alcander</HI> again; this was to me so probable, that it incensed me against <HI>Agustus,</HI> I accused him of the Crime, and, in one of my Letters, commanded him not to endeavour the justifying himself, that I was well as∣sured all he could do would be impos∣sible; and, in short, bid him to see me no more; he obey'd my Orders, too fatally in this Letter, but he has acquitted himself of that unjust Sus∣picion, too cruelly; he loved me more than Life, or Glory; what I had writ had reduced him to despair; he was acquainted with the Reconciliation of <HI>Alcander</HI> with me, and, not doubting whence my Anger proceeded, was resolved, maugre the strictness of the Laws then in force, to fight this trea∣cherous; in short, he return'd privately to Court, and challenged <HI>Alcander,</HI> and kill'd him fairly in a Duel; this Action made a great noise, the Prince meritted death by the Laws, and, had not the Emperor been indulgent, he had certainly suffered it, but he is par∣doned by a Reprieve, and the Sentence
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>of death repealed for an eternal Ba∣nishment: <HI>Agustus</HI> was permitted to see the Emperor before he went, to render him his Acknowledgment for sparing his Life, when he had so much deserved death: He had no mind to see me, on the contrary, he shunn'd coming to the Archdutchess's, to take his leave before he went into Banish∣ment, which he did as soon as the ap∣pointed time was come for his leaving <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>So fantastical was my destiny, I be∣came passionately in Love with this Prince, after I had lost all hopes of ever seeing him again; though <HI>Alcan∣der</HI> had reconciled himself again to me, and that he died in a time he was extremely favoured, yet the Bravery and the great Passion of his Murderer, had made me not grieve at his death, since he fell by so gallant a hand, and though it was for my sake, I consider'd he was Criminal, and that the Prince was innocent; the Letter was <HI>Alcan∣der</HI>'s, he is base, he charges <HI>Agustus</HI> with it; <HI>Agustus</HI>'s Resentments of the
<PB N="36" REF="20"/>Perjury has charmed me, I infinitely esteem'd him before, but now he has a greater share in my Heart than ever <HI>Alcander</HI> retained, he merits it more, and though I know it is an impossible thing for me ever to hope the seeing of him again, to assure him of it; I cannot deny the Sentiments of my Heart from doing Justice to his great Merit.</P>
<P>This fatal Accident rendered <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and more particularly the Court, disagreeable to me, since it was so to my Fortune: And whil'st I am thus drown'd in a melancholy sorrow, and having lost all hope, of ever seeing the Prince more, I am hurried, with all the Sentiments of Joy, to a probabi∣lity great as my Love, of being, in some time, with him; he had retired himself to <HI>Russia,</HI> and the great Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> who was nearly related to the Emperor, and had made some continuance in his Court, was upon the point of returning, she had taken a fancy to me, and begg'd of the Archdutchess, that she would allow
<PB N="37" REF="20"/>me to pass, into the Quality of one of of the Maids of Honour, that attended her, and to return with her to <HI>Muscovy;</HI> I was unexpressibly pleased at this Turn, and I did not at all doubt, but that my better Fortune would, in some short time, conduct me to the Prince <HI>Tiridate Agustus.</HI></P>
<P>It was with a magnificent Splendor, that we left <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Emperor, the Empress, the Princes, and the Prin∣cesses, together with the whole Court, accompanied the great Dutchess Dowager three Leagues from the City, and did not then leave her with∣out all the regret imaginable, and as so fine a Princess, as she was, did de∣serve.</P>
<P>The Archdutchess recommended me tenderly to the Care of the great Dutchess, and was pleased to express an agreeable sorrow for parting with me.</P>
<P>We accomplish'd our Journy to <HI>Po∣land</HI> very happily, where the great Dutchess was resolved to make some short stay, being obliged to it by the
<PB N="38" REF="21"/>Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> nothing could be more Glorious than the Reception we had there; the King is a gallant Prince, and had ordered every thing so splen∣didly, that the great Dutchess Dow∣ager was extremely satisfied with his manner of treating her; nothing was seen here but the most Gallant Diver∣sions, and the Business of the King, the Queen, and the whole Court, was, how to render every thing agreeable.</P>
<P>But in the mid'st of all these Diver∣sions, I found they were none to me, what the Prince <HI>Agustus</HI> had done just before, had rendered me averse to every thing of such a nature; his Re∣sentments of my Proceedings mortally afflicted me, and altogether rendered my Thoughts nothing but perpetual Inquietudes, so that, in short, not able to support such a world of Grief, I fell into a violent Fever, which, how∣ever, was not lasting, yet the whole Court despaired, at first, of my Life, and I saw the great Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Muscovy</HI> enter into my Chamber all in Tears; <HI>I must leave you,</HI> Indamora,
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>said she to me, <HI>which is a powerful Con∣tribution to my sorrow, for, assure your self, there are very few things in this world more dear to me than you; but I have just received an Express from</HI> Mus∣covy, <HI>That the Great Duke is fallen ex∣tremely ill, and we have reason to fear the consequence; all things are making ready for my departure, and I have borrowed this moment from my sorrow, to tell you my self of this misfortune, 'tis with all the Grief in the World, that I see you not able to continue our Journy together; I am constrained to leave you, and, it is true, I leave you very ill, dear</HI> Indamora, <HI>but the Great Duke is so too, I have seen you, and it's absolutely necessary that I hasten to see him; I leave with you my Physicians, part of my Retinue, and some of my Guards, to con∣duct you to</HI> Muscovy, <HI>as soon as you shall be in a condition to reassume your Journy; they have Orders to obey you, as they would do me, and to take the same Care of you. Adieu,</HI> says she, <HI>once more, dear</HI> Indamora, <HI>and,</HI> in kissing me, <HI>I do not despair of seeing you within
<PB N="38" REF="22"/>these few days, as well as I desire you should be, which, assure your self, is as well as possible, in that I love you beyond expression.</HI></P>
<P>She departed that moment, and I from that moment began to recover, I used now, which I neglected before, my own Endeavours to get well again, the thoughts, that I should suddenly see the Prince <HI>Tiridate,</HI> was a powerful Inducement, and when I considered, that the sooner my Health returned, the sooner I should see him again, I did every thing that could be done effectual; and, in short, I saw my self, in ten days, perfectly recover'd, and free from all manner of pain, but that of Love; and nothing retarded my Journy, but a languishing weak∣ness, which would not permit me yet to indure so great a Fatigue.</P>
<P>But as every thing is cured by time, so, within a few days, I saw my self in a condition to travel, I began then my Journy to <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but what avails it to have surmounted one misfortune, since it was but to fall into a greater;
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>or who can avoid the capriciousness of Fortune, when she designs we shall be eternally unhappy, all our endea∣vours to the contrary are ineffectual, for, being upon the Borders of <HI>Poland,</HI> I suddenly saw my self a Prisoner, my Guards, and all that made any Re∣sistance, were immediately cut in pices, they being more than ten times surpass'd in number, the rest with me, and six other German Ladies (that came with the Great Dutchess Dow∣ager of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and stay'd with me, by her desire, till my recovery,) were made Captives, the Turks, that con∣tinually make Incursions into <HI>Poland,</HI> were, unhappily for us, come down then, and we, being met by a Party of them, taken Prisoners.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express my Grief, to see my self a Prisoner, to a Nation I then believed the most barbarous in the world, their Customs were so different from ours, that I fancied I could never pass one hour of my Slavery agreeably; and to add to that Anguish, the thoughts of losing the
<PB N="42" REF="23"/>sight of <HI>Tiridate Agustus,</HI> for perhaps my whole Life, rendered me melan∣choly as the Grave, and I, a thousand times, wish'd to have died in <HI>Poland,</HI> rather than to have fallen into the Slavery of those Barbarians.</P>
<P>They presently resolved us for the <HI>Seraglio</HI> of the Grand Signior, in assurance of a great Ransom for us, and of me in particular, whom they treated very unlike an ordinary Captive, for the chief of the Turks, who had the Title of a Bassa, became passionately in love with me; and, as there was a Guard for his Person, he became so careless of it, as to charge them with my Safety, and abandoned his own Preservation for the Care of mine; he sighed a thousand times to me, I could understand no other Lan∣guage, which mortally afflicted him, he took Care though to remedy that, and had me, with much difficulty, instructed in the Arabick; very per∣fectly.</P>
<P>He was well-made, passionate, and brave; he one day acquainted me with
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>his Resolutions of making me his Wise, and, I think, his Love, together with my despair, would have at length made me agree to it, had not his Murther put a fatal period to all de∣signs of that nature, for when we were first made Prisoners, he had promised to the rest of his Party, that the Prize should be equally divided amongst them, his Passion to me constrained him to be false to his Promise, and all the rest of us, but the German Ladies, being sold, he absolutely refused to his People, that we should share the same destiny, which in∣spired them with Resolutions so bar∣barous as to murther him, one day, as he was at Dinner, which they did with very little Resistance, his Guards, as I said before, being with me, so that the brave Man fell, after having received 13 Wounds; and kill'd 5 with his own Hands, of those barbarous Villains, that as∣sassinated him so cruelly.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="24"/>
<P>After that Murder, they came to me, and the next day, together with the six German Ladies, they sold us to those that ingaged to bring us to the Seraglio, where after a world of fatigue, grief and despair, we arri∣ved. Death had not one happy Dart to throw at me, but abandoned me to a more cruel Fortune, and suffer'd me to come safe to the Seraglio under the conduct of those <HI>Barbarians,</HI> with more security than I could pass into <HI>Moscovy</HI> under the Guard of my own People. You ransomed me, and pla∣ced me with the Sultana Queen. It is impossible to express to you the tor∣ture I suffer at the unhappiness of my Love, and the miserable Fate of the unfortunate Bassa, but I am diverted from this by the Passion of the great <HI>Acmat,</HI> your Sultan; for I had not continued long in the Seraglio, ere I could see I did not displease him: He would somtimes give me languish∣ing and burning looks. Two nights since, when he was in the Sultana Queen's Apartment, and that he had
<PB N="45" REF="24" MS="y"/>charmed us all by his fine Wit, he gave Orders that the Court should end, and all retire; he was obeyed, though not without Reluctancy, because he had such a winning Conversation; he will however conduct the Sultana Queen to her Chamber of Repose, (to which she always retired after she was left alone;) I followed, bearing her Train, and as the Sultan quitted her hand, he seized mine with some emotion, and pressing it with ardour, he assured me, that none alive had more love and more tenderness for me than he, and that the Grand Visier, whom he was infinitely obliged to for Ransoming me, and placing me in the Seraglio, should attend when I should please to order, and in some sort as∣sure me, what a capable Monarch he was to satisfie Love and Glory when he had Inclination enough to indea∣vour it. <HI>It is a Truth,</HI> replyed the Grand Vizier, <HI>That I have those Or∣ders from the Sultan; I do not at all doubt but that you have Wit enough to make your advantage of the favourable
<PB N="46" REF="25" MS="y"/>Sentiments he has for you; Is it not bet∣ter to live gloriously, full of splendor and magnificence, (as you will then do, if you are wise) than continue a miserable Sla. very? You must flatter the Sultan in an Opinion you love him, it will not fail of pleasing him, which if once you can be so happy as to do, there is nothing in the whole Ottoman Empire but will be dis∣posed of as you shall advise. The Sultan lets himself be governed by the Woman he loves, accounting it his greatest Glory to be capable of so violent Passions of Ten∣derness. I am your Friend, and you may be satisfied I will continue so, if (as I do not at all question it) you will permit me to advise you in what I believe requi∣site. Indamora</HI> assured him she would, nay conjured him to command her in any thing, and he should be obeyed. <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa was so satisfied with her, that he was resolved not to defer the Happiness of the Sultan any lon∣ger than that day. <HI>Acmat,</HI> proceed∣ed the Visier, <HI>is impatient of Delays, he loves very ardently, but his Passions are of no continuance if he find no Returns;
<PB N="47" REF="25"/>he cannot take pains to gain a heart, if his Person, his Crowns, and his Merit, cannot be of force enough to do it, he lets himself loose from the desire of possessing what he then sighs for, and searches for those that will be more easily conquered, and in that passion buries the Remembrance of his other. He is the most constant man alive after he is assured he is beloved; and when he comes to that height, where there is nothing more to desire, he loves the most, and if any thing has power to make him inconstant, it must be the fault of her he loves, and not his natural Tem∣per. The Sultana</HI> Homira <HI>possest him a considerable time, and lost him not but by her own ill conduct and Luxury. It is your fault if you are not happy; all delay is of dangerous Consequence; he is a great Monarch, amorous, and not pleased when without a Mistress. Let us then hasten his Happiness and your Grandeur: You shall come to the Grand Visier's Palace to night, my Wife shall fetch you; the Sul∣tan shall be there also, and if you have Address enough to improve the advan∣tage, you will be more great than all your
<PB N="48" REF="26"/>Ambition could ever pretend to, or aspire at.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Acmat</HI> in the mean time waited with impatience for the Return of the Vi∣sier; he hopes all, and will fain per∣suade himself he has nothing to fear; <HI>Homira</HI> is forgotten, and nothing thought on but the beautiful <HI>Indamo∣ra.</HI> He no sooner saw <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa return, but coming up to him with a thousand different Sentiments, <HI>Is the fair Christian,</HI> says he, <HI>as flexible as she is charming, or is she as inexorable as I am amorous; give life to thy Monarch, and assure him the later is impossible.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Visier believing the Bles∣sing would be more valued with good management, would not tell him how it was resolved he should be happy that night, but bowing low (as the custom is) Indamora <HI>cannot, maugre all her modesty, but acknowledge how de∣serving, how obliging a Monarch is the great</HI> Acmat; <HI>she must be more than mor∣tal if she does not at length do Justice to your Merit and your Passion. I have as∣sured her of the favourable Inclinations
<PB N="49" REF="26"/>you have for her, and on my Soul, my Lord, she has sense, and is a Woman; she will not let me resolve you if she de∣signs to do as you command: She has ex∣prest a Desire to see you herself, which I have engaged shall be to night, at an Entertainment I have made on purpose, where, if I can Prophesie, your happiness is to begin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Acmat</HI> was so sensibly pleased at what the Grand Visier said, that he exprest it in a number of obliging words, and as a mark of his grati∣tude, will force him to receive a Pre∣sent of an immense Value; he longs for Night, and has not Patience to stay till then; he goes two hours be∣fore to the Palace of the Grand Vi∣sier, where <HI>Indamora</HI> was already come. 'Tis impossible to express his agreea∣ble Surprize when he saw her, yes, he forgot he was the Ottoman Empe∣ror, but hastening to her with all the Passion of Desire, he threw himself at her Feet, and imbracing her Knees, <HI>It is the greatest glory to</HI> Acmat <HI>ever the Gods could give him,</HI> syas he, <HI>that
<PB N="50" REF="27"/>they allow me such a charming Destiny as to lay Crowns at the Feet of the fairest of Women: More than half the World is but as you shall order it, and the most po∣tent Empire under the Heavens was ne∣ver worth esteeming till</HI> Indamora, <HI>the killing charming</HI> Indamora, <HI>governed it; you are absolute here, act in it as you please, for my part, I have but too glorious a de∣stiny in obeying. What a Satisfaction will it be to me, to make you as well the Envy as the Admiration of all. I am perfectly happy,</HI> pursued he with greater emotion of Passion; <HI>I flatter my self you are here to reward the Love of the greatest of Monarchs and the greatest of Slaves, in one Adorer. If I was obliged to</HI> Mahomet <HI>for making me the first, what ought I to render to</HI> Indamora <HI>for making me the later of these? But you are all Felicity, and everlasting laughing Love lives for ever with you. See at your feet a Lover full of Languishments, of Expe∣ctation and Desire; come learn from him what none but Love and he can teach; come to my Arms, and dye and languish there.</HI> He paused here, and seeing <HI>In∣damora</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="27"/>silent, he rose up all in despair, and anxious as he was, cryed, <HI>Ah! Gods, how have I flatter'd my self? I am scorned, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spised, and all my Life made for ever unhappy. Indamora</HI> was van∣quished by this Action, she falls into the Sultan's Arms, and declining her head on his breast, <HI>Heaven is my Wit∣ness, Sir,</HI> replied she, <HI>how much you are mistaken, and Heaven does know be∣sides I love you more than Honour, Duty, and (Oh! (ye immortal Powers, let me add without a fear of being blasted by your angry Vengeance) than all Religion too. I hasten on my own undoing, I court my Ruin, and persuade my Virtue to ab∣scond; I banish Honour, that Idol of the World, that bane of Love, and teach my Duty to be satisfied with the specious Ar∣guments of Power and you; and to assure you more, I give my Vows of being only yours, and let this Protestation, whenever I revoke, be then my greatest Curse, as now it perfects all my Happiness. Be calm, my Conscience at this Promise which I make, and let me be persuaded, while I languish in my Monarch's Arms, I am
<PB N="52" REF="28"/>happy still, without Remorse or Fears that that Eternity of Bliss is unallowed.</HI> She accompanied these words with moving accents of Passion, with some despon∣dency, and a constrained Resolution, which the Sultan easily saw, and to assure her, lavisht away such Protesta∣tions as would have fired the World, so full of Passion that <HI>Indamora</HI> could not be any longer unmoved. 'Tis said, the Grand Visier prophesied right; certain it is he is loaded with Oblige∣ments in return of that one of his, in bringing her to the Seraglio, and more in favour, if possible, than e∣ver.</P>
<P><HI>Acmat,</HI> who was the most amorous of all Princes, and who had Gran∣deur enough to maintain those Incli∣nations, now indulged himself. <HI>Inda∣mora</HI> had for him a thousand Charms; and contrary to that wretched custom which makes the Grand Signior's Pas∣sion the sole Reward of her he savou∣red, and that they were confined to a Seraglio, without the Liberty to see any but the Sultan and the Eunuchs
<PB N="53" REF="28"/>that attended him; I say, contrary to this observed Custom, <HI>Acmat</HI> gave the Title of <HI>Sultana of Barbary</HI> to <HI>Inda∣mora,</HI> and restrained her in nothing but in the Point of Amour and Gal∣lantry. None of his Predecessors had ever indulged the fair Sex so much as he. The Sultana Queen had a great Liberty allowed her: He was much condemned for his tendency to the Women, and his very Enemies ac∣knowledged he had no other weak∣ness: He derived, they said, his de∣sires of Peace from the desire he had to possess them, and that Women ren∣dred him the merciful Prince he was; it was Women they said made him desire to live in ease; and in order to it he had made Peace with the Ger∣man Emperor, and neglected to make use of those Advantages the ill po∣sture of Affairs in <HI>Hungary</HI> presented him with since the Conquest of <HI>Maho∣met</HI> III. <HI>Acmat</HI> was very brave, and had given Proof of his Valour when but a Prince; there was none que∣stioned his Courage, and he believed
<PB N="54" REF="29"/>it was enough to have once acted like a great, a valiant and experienced Soldier, that the World was satisfi'd he durst, which was enough to justi∣fie a Prince desirous of Peace, which he always preferr'd before War when he could with Honour.</P>
<P>The Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> had studied all his Weaknesses, and was perfectly ac∣quainted with his Inclinations. Jea∣lousie was never apt to disturb him, which she easily saw, and procured first for her self, and then for the Sultana Queen, that Liberty they pos∣sest. Gallantry reigned here inces∣santly, and all manner of Pleasures, with a great deal of Luxury, which notwithstanding was believ'd to please the Sultan, since he never reproved it. It was this Licentiousness ruined <HI>Homira;</HI> she fell at last into a habitual Debauchery, and was a principal Ad∣vancer, being the great Example of all the Liberties taken by Women of Quality. Love and Intrigue was no more so secretly confined to the Walls of the Seraglio, and if People were
<PB N="55" REF="29"/>discreet, it was what they were not at all obliged to be.</P>
<P>Never was an Ottoman Emperor before of such Inclinations; he had a great Soul charmed with Pleasures, and ever went in search of them; he believed the greatest terminated in the Arms of the fair Sex. <HI>It was,</HI> he would say, <HI>a great Injustice that the most perfect Blessings of human Life should be denied a Liberty which served but to make the contrary Sex more hap∣py.</HI> These Sentiments were prejudi∣cial to our Monarch; for all he had loved were debauched by them to be false to him, but they served as great advantages towards the Conquering the Hearts of those that loved to please themselves in Variety, and ha∣ted Restraint.</P>
<P>The new Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who remembred what had been advised her by the Grand Visier, failed not to as∣sure the Sultan of his great Merit, <HI>and as for her, she had loved him had he not been so great a Monarch.</HI> This Caress had the desired success; the Sultan
<PB N="56" REF="30"/>was charmed with her appearance of Sensibility, and continues to give her Protestations of his tenderness, as∣signed her the fairest Apartments in the Seraglio, ordered the Furniture to be much more glorious than the Sultany Queens, which in effect it in∣finitely was; gave her a Retinue suita∣ble to so much Grandeur, and an im∣mense Revenue to support all.</P>
<P>The Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who was extream pretty, easily became so much Glory; she was to act a part whereto the greatest Cunning in the World was required, and which with good management would be the most ad∣vantagious to her. The Sultana <HI>Ho∣mira</HI> had possest the Sultan beyond Example, yet this was no encourage∣ment to <HI>Indamora;</HI> she might believe the more of Constancy he had ex∣pressed, the less he had reserved. The Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> had advantages which <HI>Indamora</HI> could not pretend to, a lofty and an excellent Beauty, a Soul, which had it not been prostitute to her Li∣centious Inclinations, could not have
<PB N="57" REF="30" MS="y"/>been converst with without infusing Respect, Grandeur was inseparable from all her Actions, and one needed but to see her to be inspired with an awe. She was by much the finest Wo∣man that had been ever seen in <HI>Turky,</HI> and perhaps in the whole World, and once adored by the Sultan, who had been brought by her to do a thing beyond President in the Ottoman Em∣pire.</P>
<P>The good Conduct, and the Cun∣ning of <HI>Indamora,</HI> her Air of Innocence, her extreme Prettiness, her affable Humour, her diverting Wit, and, in a word, a thousand other Charms, fix'd the Sultan's Affections even to a miracle; he would spend whole days with her, call'd her his Friend, and, in short, let himself be absolutely governed by her, the whole Ottoman Empire was as she pleased to have it, all the great Offices are disposed as she desires; <HI>Germany</HI> is much advantaged by the ascendant she has in <HI>Turky,</HI> and she employs all her Arts to continue the Peace, which the natural Inclina∣tion
<PB N="58" REF="31" MS="y"/>of <HI>Acmat</HI> was inclined enough to observe.</P>
<P>But while she lives some considera∣ble time in all these Glories, and that Ambition is satisfied, how will she ac∣quit what she owes to Love? 'Tis true, she loved the Prince <HI>Agustus</HI> above all things, but she endeavours to lose the thoughts of him, in con∣sidering the little probability there was for her ever to see him again.</P>
<P>But she is infinitely alarm'd by his coming to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and all her Tenderness presents it self to her me∣mory, she sees him so amiable, so passionate, and, in a word, so deser∣ving of her Heart.</P>
<P>After <HI>Indamora</HI> had assured her self of the Affections of the Grand Sig∣nior, and that she was almost absolute in <HI>Turky,</HI> she commands the Liberty of those Ladies that were taken with her, orders two Gallies for their Con∣voy, and, in a word, gives them power to return, which they did ac∣cordingly. The Great Dutchess Dowager, who loved <HI>Indamora</HI> ten∣derly,
<PB N="59" REF="31" MS="y"/>was well pleased to hear she had escaped with Life, though it was for a wretched Slavery, she would ransom her, but when she hears again in how glorious a Station she was, she believes it vain for her to indeavour it.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Agustus,</HI> who, as we have observed, retired to <HI>Russia,</HI> learn∣ed the Captivity of <HI>Indamora,</HI> and, after a thousand. Resolutions, very different from one another, he resolves for a Journy to <HI>Turky,</HI> the distance does not at all startle him, it is no∣thing to a Man so passionately in Love as he; but first he will see, if <HI>Acmat</HI> will give him Protection, the Grand Signior, who was the most merciful Monarch under the Heavens, takes a pity on the distressed, and, commise∣rating the exil'd Prince, he returns him assured Promises of Protection, and that he shall not be obliged to tear for his Religion.</P>
<P>This satisfies the Amorous Prince, he is again going to see that dear In∣chantress, that has already ruined his
<PB N="60" REF="32"/>Fortune and his Repose, he comes to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and once adventures to the Apartments of this Princess, he surprizes her, she expects not to see him, <HI>Acmat</HI> had told her nothing of his designs in resolving to come there, she will not believe it can be he; <HI>Has my Sorrow so wholly altered me,</HI> says he, kneeling to her, <HI>that the treacherous</HI> Indamora <HI>does not know the unfortunate</HI> Agustus: <HI>All that I wonder at is, that I am yet living, for, 'tis a Truth, I have enough to kill me, if a violent Grief and Despair can do it; for, how can you be∣lieve the Amorous</HI> Tiridate <HI>can see, without suffering the extremity of Hor∣ror, the Divine</HI> Indamora <HI>in the Arms of another, of a Rival, happy beyond all, and of such a Rival, of whom we can make no Advantage by knowing it is he? That is the bless'd Man! Yes,</HI> continued he, seeing her surprized, <HI>it is the unfortu∣nate</HI> Agustus, <HI>is now dying at your Feet; and who, for a violent Passion for the most ungrateful of all Women, was re∣duced to the Extremity of Vengeance; you made me this miserable, offend my God
<PB N="61" REF="32"/>and my Emperor, by murthering a happy, and a base ingrateful Rival, who, did he live again, should hear it ecchoed by the wrong'd</HI> Agustus: <HI>He did not at all me∣rit the least of your ingaging Favours. Yes,</HI> persued he, <HI>it is for you I am ba∣nished from my Country, doom'd to an inglorious exile; and, oh horror! meet in it that killing fatal sight, of seeing you in anothers Arms; but how,</HI> said he, more calmly, and raising himself up, <HI>could I expect other from the faithless, treache∣rous,</HI> Indamora.</P>
<P>At this Discourse <HI>Indamora</HI> appear∣ed surpriz'd, and, swooning in his Arms, could utter but confusedly, <HI>My God, and my Agustus;</HI> 'tis true, the manner of her wonder was kind, but the Prince was not satisfied with that, he durst not believe her Amazement had in it any thing of tender, but it was not a time to make such Reflecti∣ons as these, he employ'd his whole Endeavours for her Recovery, and had just effected it, when Notice was given of the Sultan's approach, she had not leisure to clear her self from the
<PB N="62" REF="33"/>Imputation the Prince had charged her with, all she could say was, <HI>to bid him meet her on the morrow, in the Even∣ing, in one of the covered Walks in the Garden of the</HI> Seraglio, for <HI>Acmat</HI> imme∣diately entered the Chamber she was in, as <HI>Agustus</HI> had quitted it by ano∣ther door.</P>
<P>The Sultan appear'd disordered, and ill-humour'd, very contrary to his usual Temper, <HI>Indamora</HI> trembled for her Lover, and for her self, she began to fear he had seen that Prince, and though he was not accustomed to be jealous of so much, yet she knew not what could discompose him, be∣sides, she approach'd him tremblingly, and with such innocent Instruction, that it was not in the Power of <HI>Acmat</HI> to conceal from her the occasion of his Disorder, he complained to her of <HI>Mustapha,</HI> (Yes, says he,) <HI>that ingrate∣ful Prince, not contented with that un∣paralell'd Example I have given him of my Mercy, in saving his Life, endeavours, how he may render mine as uneasie as possible: Was it not enough to allow him
<PB N="63" REF="33" MS="y"/>once the Liberty of pleasing his Inclinations, by a Marriage contrary to mine, but he must again repeat the very same Crime? We must not suffer this from one we have set down our Successor, but endeavour, by our Authority, to crush this Design: Yes, it is resolved, and if he disobey, we will not any longer consider him as our Brother.</HI> He then ordered the Captain of his Guard to bring <HI>Mustapha</HI> to him, as soon as he should be found, which, in effect, they did; the Sultan, who very seldom in his whole life-time had been transported with a violent Anger, no sooner saw the Prince, than that he softened all into Reproaches of Tenderness; <HI>Ought you,</HI> said he, <HI>to have used yours, and the Worlds, Emperor, nay, more, your Brother, after this manner; and by a Marriage with</HI> Zayda, <HI>the Daughter of</HI> Mahomet <HI>Bassa, our Grand Visier, whom our mere Grace has raised to what he is: Ah!</HI> Mustapha, <HI>you make an end of ruining the Repose of</HI> Acmat <HI>by these cruel Resolves; you force him to do a thing very contrary to his Inclinations, he desires to comply with all
<PB N="64" REF="34" MS="y"/>yours, but this is what we can never allow. How,</HI> said the Prince, after the Sultan had done speaking, <HI>Is it possible I should abuse so much Tenderness?</HI> He then prostrated himself at the Feet of the Grand <HI>Acmat,</HI> begg'd a Re∣mission of his Sin, and renounced all his Passion, and all the Designs and Desires he had of possessing <HI>Zayda,</HI> since he saw it could not be without ruining himself; the Sultan was ap∣peased, and the Conversasion ended, in an express Command for <HI>Mastapha to marry the Daughter of the King of</HI> Tunis, <HI>who would, in a very little time, be at</HI> Constantinople, <HI>in order for the Accomplishment of the Marriage, which was already concluded on.</HI></P>
<P>We are now to return to the Sultana <HI>Homira,</HI> who retired her self after her Disgrace, but hearing the Grand Visier has placed a fair Christian in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> with a design of ren∣dering <HI>Acmat</HI> in Love with her, and that he has found the desired success, that she is created Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and that the Grand Visier is more
<PB N="65" REF="34"/>than ever favoured by this turn of Fortune; she will come again to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> to see what ought to be done, she puts in practice all her acquir'd Languishments, again to render the Sultan sensible, and to divert his Passion for <HI>Indamora;</HI> she attempts it by a thousand Artifices, contrary to the extreme Haughtiness of her Spirit; but nothing she can do avails any thing, she sees 'tis requi∣site for her to dissemble, nothing can be effected without it; she will be re∣venged on the Prince, and on the Visier, by other means, since she has failed on the tender part; <HI>Mustapha</HI> had been the occasion of her Disgrace, but it was by the Assistance of <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa, since he was not powerful enough to do it alone; and it was this later had made an end of ruining (by the fair Eyes of the charming Cap∣tive <HI>Indamora,</HI>) the repose of <HI>Homira.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Homira</HI> resents more than her Disgrace, she must be revenged on the Grand Visier, whatever it costs her; she enquired, and finds <HI>Mustapha</HI> con∣tracted
<PB N="66" REF="35"/>to <HI>Zayda,</HI> Relique of a Noble Turk, and Son to <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa; she believes this discovery of force enough to ruin all, and, animated by a desire of revenge, on her most inveterate Enemies, she goes to the Grand Sig∣nior, casts her self at his Feet, makes him apprehend, how zealous she is for his Interests, and his Glory, and re∣lates to him all she had learn'd of <HI>Mu∣stapha,</HI> with Aggravations on <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa's Ambitious Crimes.</P>
<P><HI>Homira</HI> did not consider she had to deal with the mildest Prince under the Heavens, and one that delighted in any thing rather than Cruelty; but she flatters her self, by some Promises, that the great <HI>Acmat</HI> had made her, of sensibly revenging the Injury that was done him; but as he was the mer∣cifullest, so was he the forgetfullest, of all Men, and did not remember what he had said to her, but alone re∣flected on what had been told him by <HI>Homira.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as he had quitted her, he came to the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI>'s Apart∣ments,
<PB N="67" REF="35"/>where he put an end (as we have observed,) to this important Affair, by the natural Sweetness of his Temper, and the Compliance of <HI>Mustapha.</HI></P>
<P>This did not at all please <HI>Homira,</HI> she was almost wild with despair; she had proposed to her self no less than the deaths of <HI>Mustapha</HI> and the Grand Visier, nay, she let her hopes have a loose, and believed she should cer∣tainly regain the Affections of the Sultan, when <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa was once removed, since it was he instructed <HI>Indamora</HI> in all things necessary for the preservation of the Grand Signior's Passion; but when she saw in what the Anger of the Sultan terminated, and that all his Promises to her were for∣got, she believes that she knew not enough of the Intrigue; <HI>Zayda,</HI> she was assured, could satisfie her in every thing, if she had a mind to it; it was not yet known, that it had been <HI>Ho∣mira</HI> had made the discovery to the Sultan, so she believes she may flatter <HI>Zayda</HI> into Compliance, she was the
<PB N="68" REF="36"/>more induced to it because she knew <HI>Zayda</HI> was of an extreme haughty Spi∣rit, insupportable when she was dis∣pleased, and, in a word, full of Re∣sentments when she was so sensibly in∣jured; <HI>Homira</HI> was of opinion, the Humour of this Lady was the most like her own, as the posture of Affairs stood then; she made her a Visit, and found her in a very good Humour for her designs, reproaching the Prince, who had just left her, of Inconstancy, of Perjury, and, in a word, of all manner of ill; the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> in∣dulged her in an opinion of her Wrongs, wept with her, pretended Commiseration for her Misfortunes, and, in effect, obtained her desire, which was an account of the Ingage∣ment, which <HI>Zayda</HI> thus related to her.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Amours of</HI> Mustapha <HI>and</HI> Zayda.</HEAD>
<P>IT was at a House of the Grand Visiers, two days Journy from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that this ungrateful Prince, the perjured <HI>Mustapha,</HI> first address'd to me; he had been Hunting in the adjoyning Woods, and was come to sup with my Father, who was ever a real Admirer of this Prince, who did then appear to me infinitely agreeable, his Flattery, if any thing that could be said, could give me a good opinion of my self, did effect it; and though I never loved him, I had Ambition enough to persuade him to an Assurance I did, and all his address to me that night I made agreeable; however, early the following day, he set forward to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and would carry my Father with him; who, after he had furnish'd all things for my Re∣ception,
<PB N="70" REF="37"/>where, as Glorious as if I had already been Sultana, he sent for me to come to him; you may easily believe I obeyed without Reluctancy, I had the hopes of a Crown Glittering in my Eyes, and though I was extreme young, I had a haughty Ambition with me, that surmounted all things, and I resolved to sacrifice all to satisfie this imperious charming Passion.</P>
<P>I arrived at <HI>Constantinople</HI> with all the Joy imaginable; I carress'd my Father, to make him continue a Di∣version so favourable to my best Incli∣nations; he was full of the Design of making me Great, indeavoured it with as much Affection, as if I had been nearer to him than the Wife of his deceased Son. I found in his Palace Glory enough, to have satisfied the most immense Ambition; and, per∣haps, had not I entertained hopes of being one day Sultana Queen, so much Glory as I saw there, would have sa∣tiated my Desires of it, not that I loved the Man that was to make me Great, but I loved the Greatness, and
<PB N="71" REF="37"/>was resolved to be grateful to the Author of it.</P>
<P>I was one day in a fine Chamber of State in the Grand Visier's Palace, drest in all the richest Glory of the <HI>East,</HI> and in a humour of being flat∣ter'd, when I saw the Prince introdu∣ced by my Father enter it: I would have gone away out of a Modesty and Respect, had not the Grand Visier commanded my Stay, who being im∣mediately called to the Grand Signior, left the Prince alone with me. Then it was indeed I would have retired, had not the Prince absolutely resol∣ved to hinder me. <HI>Ah, too charming</HI> Zayda, said he languishingly, <HI>why are you thus inexorable? Do not you yet know how fervently I adore you?</HI> This Dis∣course was more than I thought I ought to have heard without being displeased. <HI>Ah! my Lord,</HI> replied I, <HI>you take little Care of the Honour of an unfortunate Woman, neither do you confi∣der what you oblige me to suffer.</HI> This Discourse, accompanied with some necessary Tears, drew from the passio∣nate
<PB N="72" REF="38"/><HI>Mustapha</HI> some Religious Prote∣stations; He assured me that none knew where he was, That he had left the Seraglio privately, and conducted by the Grand Visier, had come to his Palace wholly unattended. This sa∣tisfied, since nothing is indiscreet but what is known. I then permitted him to adore, flatter and protest, without interrupting him. I believe I did ne∣ver more deserve to be admired, and that if <HI>Zayda</HI> could look well, it was that day: I did think he render'd me but that was my due, and that my Heart deserved more Homage than my Eyes. I assured him, That my Ascendant was Glory, and that I had as much Passion for him as I was ca∣pable of entertaining for any one; that it was as fervent as Ambition would permit it to be, and that he that could ever move my tenderness must flatter my hopes, and approve of the most ambitious Desires under the Heavens, and seek also to gra∣tifie them.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="38"/>
<P>The Prince seem'd transported at this Confession, he rendered Thanks to our great Prophet, for shewing a a way to please the charming <HI>Zayda;</HI> and assured me, it was my fault if I was not one day Sultana Queen.</P>
<P>He then retired, and my Father entered some moments after, to whom I gave an exact Account of all that had been said; the Grand Visier was well pleased at my Conduct, and, after having given me some necessary In∣structions, he ordered me to prepare my self for going to the <HI>Seraglio</HI> that night, to pay my Homage to the Sul∣tana Queen; which, in effect, I did; there was then in the Presence the young <HI>Amurath,</HI> who had been dis∣graced for some considerable time, and was but that hour reconciled to the merciful Sultan; the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> blush'd at this Discourse, but <HI>Zayda</HI> continuing, left her no room to re∣flect.</P>
<P>The Gallant <HI>Amurath</HI> was, in my opinion, the most lovely of all Men; I gazed intemperately on him, and, in
<PB N="74" REF="39"/>a word, gazed away my Liberty; I often met his charming Eyes, mine ever went in search of them, and I left the <HI>Seraglio</HI> passionately in Love; I was generally observed I did every thing that night with a Distraction, so uncommon to me, and took so lit∣tle care to manage my self, that it was apparent enough I was become really in Love with <HI>Amurath;</HI> he was told it, and, half of that opinion, resolved to appear sensible, and to write me a Declaration of Love, which he con∣veyed unperceived into my Glove. The following night, when I return'd to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> he was then more than before (by my manner of Carriage,) confirmed in an opinion he was not indifferent to me, he resolved not to lose my favourable Inclinations, for want of Addresses; and when I call'd for my Gloves, and my <HI>Barnus,</HI> he who waited behind presented me with them, but with so much amaze and trembling, that I was going to give a publick Demonstration of my Passion (by a loud Cry,) to call some Assi∣stance
<PB N="75" REF="39"/>to him, but his recovering him∣self from that surprize diverted me, but though I did not give that Authen∣tick Testimony, my Lips were Har∣bingers of my Passion; and I did not quit <HI>Amurath</HI> without telling him, in dumb show, he could not be unhappy; when I went to draw on my Glove, and found the Letter there, I, unper∣ceived, put it up, till I came to the Grand Visier's Palace, and to my own Apartments, where I opened it, and read thus;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD><HI>Amurath</HI> to the Charming <HI>Zayda.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I <HI>Am favoured, Madam, more than ever any was; I am to dye, but it is with adoring you so much as I do. Ah! Have I not too glorious a Destiny, and ought I not to boast of it? See how dan∣gerously fair you are; ah! too charming</HI> Zayda, <HI>the irresistible Power of your Eyes have made me guilty of Temerity: It cannot but be confessed,</HI> Amurath <HI>does of all Men most adore you; he is presumptu∣ous, but he is extreme Amorous; I know
<PB N="76" REF="40"/>my ambitious Passion merits all Punish∣ment, for sinning so high, as to raise all my Love, and all my Adorations, to the finest Woman under the Heavens; but there is no mean when one loves you, it must be with as much ardency as is felt in the Heart of</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Amurath.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I was infinitely pleased with this Letter, I loved as much as he, and never had so much Joy as in the read∣ing of it; but I must not let that Joy appear, 'tis not after that manner we must carry our selves, we must seem angry when we are not, so, in short, displeased at the only thing that pleases us best, so fantastical is the Custom of our Sex.</P>
<P><HI>Mustapha</HI> was just entered the Cham∣ber as I had put up the Letter, he found me in a Humor so good, and so pleased, that he knew not what to be∣lieve, but, fired with the common Report of my being in Love with <HI>A∣murath,</HI> he reproached me, but so re∣spectfully,
<PB N="77" REF="40"/>and with such a melancholy Sorrow, that I could not then but con∣demn the wildness of my Inclinations, and my Passions; I endeavoured to calm him, by demanding of him, <HI>If it were possible to entertain two Passions, for two several Persons, at the same indi∣vidual time.</HI> This satisfied his Jea∣lousie, he would be appeased, because he saw I desired it; but yet, he ex∣acts this killing Resolution of me, <HI>To go no more to the</HI> Seraglio, <HI>till he per∣mitted me;</HI> this was a thing so averse to my Inclinations, that I knew not, surprized as I was, how to answer him. <HI>If you love me, as you persuade me,</HI> said he, <HI>this will be an easie De∣monstration of your Sincerity; but if, on the contrary, you have your Liberty—And ah! What is it I do here, with one that makes no Returns to my Passion? I had much rather never see you, as I must do, if I am indifferent to you, than adore and expose my self here, only to flatter and satisfie the Vanity of an Ambitious Wo∣man.</HI></P>
<PB N="78" REF="41"/>
<P>By what the Prince had then said, I very easily guess'd, what measures I was to take; I dissembled my Inclina∣tions, and would sacrifice my Love to my Ambition, I did, without much difficulty, persuade him, he was dear to me; he demanded again, as a Te∣stimony of my Passion, the same thing my surprize made me silent to before; <HI>I gave him my word, of my not going to the</HI> Seraglio <HI>till he assented to it;</HI> he is satisfied, and retires so, but leaves me tossed by a tumultuous sort of Disquiets, Glory and Love are the Disputes, but the God must yield, and Ambition was the most Powerful; I was govern'd by that ascendant, not without terrible Disquiets, it cost me Tears and Inquietudes, I call'd the Prince tyrannical and unjust, and had I not been obliged to keep those mea∣sures with him I did, on the hopes of a Crown, I should have taken pleasure in opposing the Man, that was so ab∣solutely indifferent to me; before I had seen and loved <HI>Amurath, Mustapha</HI> was agreeable to me, but he had lost him∣self
<PB N="79" REF="41"/>by his Jealousie, and it was for the Crown on the Head of the Sulta∣na Queen, I dissembled my Inclinati∣ons, the constraint I suffered, had I had no other merit, deserved it, and he was unjust, to the highest degree, in denying it me.</P>
<P>The Grand Visier, (who, you know, Madam, is the wittiest Man in the whole Ottoman Empire,) no sooner learnt from me, that the Prince loved well enough to be jealous, than that he went to him, and, falling insensibly to talk of me, <HI>Mustapha</HI> declared his opinion, <HI>That he believed he should love me for ever; Mahomet</HI> Bassa persuing the Discourse, represented to him, how disadvantageous such a Passion must be for any Woman, that was but the Daughter of a Subject; <HI>I am infi∣nitely sorry, my Lord,</HI> (says the Grand Visier,) <HI>that I am forced to desire you to forbear your Visits to</HI> Zayda, <HI>though they have hitherto, in our opinion, been private, I am to assure you, we were mistaken, judg then, my Lord, how disadvantageous this must be for her, she is young, and a very
<PB N="80" REF="42"/>little thing ruins her Honor, the way you take is not at all consistent to her Repu∣tation, which runs a great risque in the World, unless, my Lord, you design what is death in us, almost but to wish. It is in your own Power, if you will chuse to see</HI> Zayda <HI>yours, or never see her more— Ah!</HI> said the Prince hastily, interrupting him, <HI>Name not such a Hell of Horror to me, I will marry her,— I will run the risque of the Sultan's Dis∣pleasure, any thing rather than lose her. But were I capable, my Lord,</HI> (reply'd the Grand Visier, bowing low,) <HI>to advise you in it, it should be to resolve against it; the Great</HI> Acmat, <HI>though he is the most merciful of all Princes, yet, find∣ing himself so sensibly injured, may pass to a Resolution of revenging the little Re∣spect that will be shew'd him by such an Action; he hardly forgave you your first Marriage, and will undoubtedly punish your second, if it be of the same nature.</HI> He then again press'd him to quit me, but not with a design, I believe, that the Prince should follow his advice; he would not hear of that, he appeared
<PB N="81" REF="42"/>extreme Amorous, and when the Grand Visier proposed it a third time, he commanded him, on pain of his Displeasure, to say no more of it.</P>
<P>I saw the Prince every day for some time longer; I kept my word, and did not go to the Seraglio; <HI>Amurath</HI> be∣lieved I had been displeased at his Declaration of Love, and that I had taken that way to punish him: He came once to see the Grand Visier, and I, who was walking in the Palace Gardens, had not the Power to say any thing to him: in short, I was so agitated by Passion, by Desire, and by Fear of <HI>Mustapha,</HI> that I swooned in the Arms of my Women, and was carried to my Apartment ere <HI>Amu∣rath</HI> could possibly speak to me. He believed, whatever had been told him to the contrary, that my Fainting was a testimony of my Aversion, since such extraordinary Disorders are es∣sential to it; he believed me angry with him, and altogether he was as discomposed as I; he sought to obtain my Pardon for his crime, and em∣ployed
<PB N="82" REF="43"/>the Daughter of the Aga of the Janisaries to effect it. <HI>In short,</HI> said I to that Lady, <HI>I give to you what none besides could have exacted from me.</HI> Amurath <HI>shall have his Pardon, condi∣tionally he never return again with the same Presumption, as to dare to love me. Amurath</HI> refused these Offers, and as∣sured me by the Aga of the Janisa∣ries's Daughter, he had rather submit to all the cruel effects of my Anger. In a word, I was constrained by my own Inclinations, and the Ladies Im∣portunities, to pardon him on his own Conditions, and give Leave for him to love me.</P>
<P><HI>Mustapha</HI> was ignorant of all this, and after he had continued his Visits to me four or five days longer, the Grand-Visier, maugre the Prince's Commands, would oblige him to quit me incessantly, or resolve on some∣thing. The Prince hearkened to the Reasons he alledged, and was really so far transported with a desire, I be∣lieve, of ridiculing me, as that very day to be contracted to me. I was
<PB N="83" REF="43"/>pleased with so much Glory; I thought I had but one step more to make to sa∣tisfie my Ambition, which would then be bounded. <HI>Mustapha</HI> came the fol∣lowing day again, to assure me of his Resolutions of making me his Wife. I carest him more than usual, and while I was thus flattering my self, the Grand Signior's Captain of his Guard came with express Orders to bring <HI>Mustapha</HI> to the Sultan, at the Apartments of the Sultana of <HI>Barba∣ry,</HI> where he then was, The Prince durst not disobey, but assured me, in quitting the Chamber, <HI>Nor</HI> Acmat <HI>nor Heaven could ever make him false to me, or relinquish the holy Vows and Protesta∣tions he had so lately made me.</HI></P>
<P>But, Oh Heavens! cried out the wronged <HI>Zayda,</HI> how unjust, and how treacherous he was; As soon as he had quitted the Sultan, he caused himself to be again conducted where I was; I wonder how the Traytor, the per∣fidious Ingrate, durst ever look on me again: He fell on his Knees before me, and with a feigned Sorrow, and
<PB N="84" REF="44"/>a Passion pauled with Duty, learnt me the Commands of <HI>Acmat,</HI> and how that he must resolve to obey them. He was beginning to deplore his Misfortunes, when I, all enraged with a violent despair, was searching for a Dagger I usually carried with me, to have stabbed to the heart the most Criminal of men; and it would certainly have been a Pleasure unex∣pressible, for me to have glutted my Eyes and my Rage in the Bloud of a Villain, for nothing else can atone for all his Perjuries.</P>
<P>My Poinyard, by a deplorable ill fate, was not then with me, which the more enraged me, and altogether so opprest me with a fatal Weight, that quite blinded with the violence of an angry Passion, I sunk down on the floor. <HI>Mustapha</HI> would have rai∣sed me, but I abhorred him too much to see him near me, unless it had been in my power to have then given him Death. <HI>Ah, Villain,</HI> said I, <HI>if thou wilt continue to torment me, thou need∣est but to tarry here; I was curst the first
<PB N="85" REF="44"/>moment that I saw thee, and have ever since remained so.</HI></P>
<P>He endeavoured then to clear him∣self as much as possibly he could, pro∣tested he still loved me, and that no∣thing but a prevention of an inevita∣ble Ruin of me, the Grand Visier, and himself, could have forced him to do so ill an Act. <HI>Thou oughtest,</HI> said I, <HI>to have let us perished all together, ra∣ther than to have been perjured, to have made the unjust Sultan perish, to let the whole World be ruined, rather than have treated me thus, but since thou wert of so base a Temper as to prefer an inglorious Life before a glorious Ruin, thou oughtest to expiate thy Crime by thy Death, and though thou didst not love well enough, to have died to have been just to that Passion. Be just at least to thy Honour, and die for thy Perjuries; go, and never let me see thee more.</HI> I turned from him then, and he left me, after ha∣ving said, <HI>You are mad, I am unhappy, and I must be gone.</HI> I was reflecting (persued <HI>Zayda</HI>) on all I had done for a Crown, how I had sacrificed my
<PB N="86" REF="45"/>Love to the Hopes of it, and how I was disappointed, when you enter'd. And thus I have given you an account of this Engagement, and of the Per∣juries of the most undeserving of Men.</P>
<P>Thus did <HI>Zayda</HI> finish her Relation. The Sultana <HI>Homira,</HI> in another time, would have died with Rage at the Confession she made her of her being in Love with <HI>Amurath;</HI> but he had used the Sultana too barbarously to merit any thing of Tender from her: He had exposed her Letters, and base∣ly rendred her as ill Offices as possi∣bly, though it was by her he made himself first considerable.</P>
<P><HI>Homira</HI> had learnt the whole De∣spair of <HI>Zayda;</HI> she valued nothing now she saw her hopes baffled, her Ambition ruined, and all her great expectations vanisht. The Sultana, though she had heard particulars, could draw nothing advantagious to her designs of ruining <HI>Mustapha</HI> and the Grand Visier; she saw she had all
<PB N="87" REF="45"/>the Revenge this Rancountre could give her, and since she failed of mur∣dering ought but their Repose, she triumphed in doing that; though it is a truth, she had done <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bas∣sa and the fair <HI>Zayda</HI> the most sensible Injury; and perhaps this later would have rather she had robb'd her of her Life, than a Crown, which in all ap∣pearance had been hers, had not the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> discovered to the Grand Signior their Engagements. <HI>Zayda</HI> did not know how much she was obliged to her, but when she helpt her to rail at the Prince, be∣lieved her the greatest of her friends, and used her accordingly. The trea∣cherous Sultana, after her Caress, be∣lieved she would receive any Advice she gave her, and first conjured her to be her friend, as she was sincerely hers, feign'd her Anger to <HI>Mustapha</HI> to all the height imaginable, and would fain persuade her to the Reso∣lutions of some way or other to give him the Death he deserved. Her Dissimulation terminated in this; but
<PB N="88" REF="46"/><HI>Zayda,</HI> who had no manner of Incli∣nation for the Prince, and who, since she had failed of murdering him the first time, altered her Resolutions; She considered his Death could not place the Crown she had lost upon her head, and was resolved to lose the thoughts of him, and to retire from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> assisted by the ad∣vice of the Grand Visier, who was sensibly displeased, but durst not ap∣pear so. She will dissemble, and try, if, in the Arms of <HI>Amurath,</HI> she could find some Tranquility after this un∣expected Misfortune.</P>

<HEAD>THE AMOURS OF THE Sultana of <HI>Barbary.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Second Part.</HEAD>
<P>THE Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> during all these Trans∣actions, was reflecting of the Assignation she had given the Prince <HI>Tiridate;</HI> the Sultan left her late that night, so that it was already morning, when <HI>Indamora</HI> came into the Gardens, agi∣tated by a number of Disquiets and
<PB N="90" REF="47"/>Fears, she would hear, what he would say to her, she would clear her self to him, and yet she does not know for what reason; she begins to fancy she loves him more than she does any, she desires he should believe, not Love but Interest made her what she then was; she apprehended a Passion for the amiable <HI>Agustus</HI> would ruin her, and yet she has not Power to suppress it; it was <HI>Tiridate</HI> had first taught her, how to love well, and it was he, that had, ever since (maugre her Passion for <HI>Alcander,</HI>) been very dear to her, and, further, it was he, that had been content, for her, to suffer an inglori∣ous Exile, and though it was a hard Banishment, kindly meant, since it reprieved him from an ignominions Death, yet it was what lost him all his Fame, and all his Friends; the fair Sultana was sensible of this, and though she had had no concern for him, Gra∣titude would make her acknowledge her self obliged, for perhaps there was not a Man in the World, would do so much for the Love of her; she was
<PB N="91" REF="47"/>not at all displeased with the Murthe∣rer of <HI>Alcander,</HI> because in the Person of <HI>Tiridate.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince had all these Advantages on his side, the fair Sultana had an amorous Soul, a Receptacle of Ten∣derness, and, in a word, she knew not how to be cruel to a Man she had been so intimately acquainted with, yet the Fate of <HI>Homira</HI> was a restraint to her for some moments, and but for some moments; she considered her Indiscre∣tion lost the Sultan more than her Li∣centiousness, she was not discreet, with∣out which, a Woman is in a deplora∣ble Condition.</P>
<P>The Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> was assured she wanted no cunning, nor an ascen∣dant over the Great <HI>Acmat,</HI> to hinder him from seeing and believing what she did not give leave to, and perhaps she had some Apprehensions of <HI>Tiridate,</HI> should she be more cruel now, than in the Emperor's Court, he had Letters of hers, and, in short, it was in his Power to make a misunderstanding be∣tween the Sultan and her, notwith∣standing
<PB N="92" REF="48"/>her boasted power over him; agitated, I say, by all these different Reflections, she entred the Gardens of the Seraglio, and immediately pas∣sed to the covered Walks, where she expects to find the Religious Prince, not considering the Custom of the place, which permitted none (but those of the Seraglio, the Sultan and the chief Gardiner) upon pain of death, to tarry there after night. However she goes, she comes, she looks about, she enters all the Grottoes, and at length, in one of the most re∣tir'd ones, she sees a Woman alone, wrapt up in her Barnus, supinely laid on one of the Banks, and reading a Letter by the help of the Moon, which lent her light enough.</P>
<P>The fair Sultana, disappointed as she was of seeing <HI>Tiridate</HI> resolved to amuse herself with the discovery of that person that was so closely con∣ceal'd under a Barnus. She entred the Grotto with Caution, and obli∣ged the other to look round her, by taking that Letter from her. <HI>Inda∣mora</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="48"/>had long since been above what ever any but the Qeeen Sultaness could say to her, and if she dreaded any thing besides, it was the Malice of <HI>Ho∣mira;</HI> she prepared to read the Let∣ter; but how was she surprized to see there the name of <HI>Tiridate Agustus?</HI> she testified her Amazement by a loud Cry, and addrest her self (after ha∣ving thrown the Letter from her) to embrace the other she had taken it from: She believed it could be no other but the Religious Prince under that Disguise; <HI>how ingenious is Love, my</HI> Agustus! says she, <HI>and how am I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o ask thy Pardon for making thee wait thus long. The Sultan had but just left me as I entred these Gardens, where I had al∣most lost all hope of seeing thee; he exacts all ones time, and one can find almost none to give to love.</HI> She ended here, and wondered the supposed <HI>Tiridate</HI> made her no Returns, but stoopt to take up the Letter, which when he had done, he infinitely surprized her, by owning himself to be the Grand Signior under the Disguise of a Woman Slave. <HI>In∣damora,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="49"/>at this Confession, knew not what excuse to make; she believed her silence would plead best, and to pre∣vent her from saying any thing, she swooned, but immediately recovered at the Assurance given her by him that held her, he was not the Sultan, but <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa; she is raised by this Assurance, and laught with him at that fear she expressed by his Fallacy. Had it been any other but the Grand Visier, she had been undoubtedly ruined by what she had said; but he it was to whom she was obliged for all her Grandeur, and one whom she had made acquainted with all her weak∣nesses. She amazedly required of him the reason of his Disguise, and by what means that Letter had come into his hands, which she saw was addrest to her self, and which the Grand Vi∣sier read thus to her,</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>You are certainly too full of Guilt, and too conscious of it, to dare endeavour the clearing your self; How is it, that you have ordered me to attend you to night in
<PB N="95" REF="49"/>the covered Walks of the Garden of the</HI> Seraglio, <HI>and then not to come! Consider with your self, what a faithless inconstant Woman you are, though I possess neither the Rank, nor the Merit, of the Sultan, a great deal more is due to my Love; what he has done for the Sultana of</HI> Barbary, <HI>has not at all injured his Glory or his Pow∣er; but what</HI> Tiridate <HI>has done for the fair inconstant</HI> Indamora, <HI>has ruined all he had dear in this World: Consider this, (unjust Princess!) and know, that, maugre all what you have done, I still adore you, and am come to</HI> Constantino∣ple <HI>to receive your Orders, how I shall dis∣pose of my self, since my Life and Death are but what you please to command 'em; yet, assure your self, I can never suffer to live, and not possess (as formerly I did,) all that the Heavenly</HI> Indamora <HI>can call hers.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>After the reading of this Letter, which cost the fair Sultana some Blushes, she again conjured the Grand Visier to satisfie her when he receiv'd it, and from whom; Why he was dis∣guised
<PB N="96" REF="50"/>so? And, Why he was so care∣less of his Safety, as to pass a night in the Garden of the <HI>Seraglio?</HI> To all which <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa answered by this following Relation.</P>
<P>I had no sooner heard, says the Visier, that it was a Revenge of <HI>Homi∣ra,</HI> that <HI>Mustapha</HI>'s Engagement, with <HI>Zayda,</HI> was made known to the Sultan, than I resolved to let her understand, by some Act, how I resented the ill effects of her inverate malice; the Love I had had formerly for her, no longer disquieted me, and if she was dear to me one hour, I hated her the next as much, for her unjust Usage of me, and all her Perjuries; she denied, after her Promise, to give to me what a thousand others possess'd; this, at first, was an unconsolable Affliction, but time, which conquers all Resent∣ments, of what nature soever, taught me not to value, and at length, to de∣spise, the Weaknesses of this unjust Sultaness; <HI>Morat,</HI> the chief Gardener, who is one of the greatest of my Friends, received my Orders, to make
<PB N="97" REF="50"/>his Addresses to her, and, when en∣joy'd, to expose her; this was, I thought, the greatest Revenge I could have, in that low Condition she was in; 'tis true, it was by my designs she became so, but she had sensibly injured me since her disgrace, and I must again revenge it: <HI>Morat</HI> made an effectual Address, enjoy'd her, and, in a word, received another Assignation (in the remotest <HI>Grotto</HI> in the covered Walks of the Garden of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI>) for this Night; he was to be, as you see me now, in the Dress of a Slave, for the more Security; the Grand Gardener (who held not himself so obliged, by the Sultana's Favours, as to neglect what he owed to me,) failed not to learn me all that he knew. It was then that I found my Passion for her not ex∣tinct, and yet I hated her to the death, I thought it would be an infinite of Pleasure to me, to take <HI>Morat</HI>'s place, and, by consequence, possess what she treacherously refused me; it was to me the highest Satisfaction in the World, to think, how she would resent this
<PB N="98" REF="51"/>Affront, after I should disabuse her, when, in the room of the Grand Gar∣dener, she should find the Grand Vi∣sier, her most mortal Enemy; this (I say,) flattered my Love, and my Re∣venge, so much, that I put on the Slaves Dress, and, conducted by <HI>Mo∣rat,</HI> (who no longer valued the Sul∣tana, since he had received from her all he could expect,) I entered the Gardens, and passed with silence to the covered Walks, I presently discovered the beautiful <HI>Homira</HI> advancing to∣wards an Eunuch, that, as I have since apprehended, waited there, by the Order of the Christian Prince, for your arrival; however it were, the Sultana, who was also disguised, ap∣proached the Eunuch, that attended there, made him believe she came from the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> with Orders to receive the Letter, which the Slave, without any farther Examination, put into her hands; I presently apprehend∣ed some ill designs, from that inraged Spirit, and, quitting <HI>Morat,</HI> who re∣tired at the first sight of her, doubled
<PB N="99" REF="51"/>my pace, and was got up to her, be∣fore she had opened the Letter; <HI>We are likely, my dear,</HI> said she to me, in believing me to be the chief Gardener, <HI>to make some Discoveries, here was, not long since, one of your Sex, though not so very much disguised as you, that put this Letter into the hands of an Eunuch, to de∣liver to the Sultana of</HI> Barbary; <HI>thou knowest, my dear, what Reasons I have to hate her, I easily got it from the Slave:</HI> She then gave it to me to read; you may imagin the Joy I had to see it in my hands; we entered the Grotto, she would oblige me to let her hear what was in the Letter, I easily diverted her from it, I pretended the Passion I had for her, was too ardent to amuse the Heavenly Moments (which I bought with the hazard of my Life,) in Trifles, like those; (I told her,) that there was enough of other time, to give to things of that nature, and that Love would have reason to be angry, at me his glorious Favourite, if I lavish'd away the hasty happy hour, in such an unpardonable idle manner.</P>
<PB N="100" REF="52"/>
<P>'Tis easie for you to divine, con∣tinued the Visier, with a Smile, (and looking fixedly on <HI>Indamora,</HI>) how we entertained one another, she believed me <HI>Morat,</HI> and I fancied her the <HI>Ho∣mira</HI> I had once loved, above the hopes of a blessed Eternity: In short, I pos∣sess'd what I had so long sigh'd for, and what she had so unjustly denied me, maugre my transporting desires of Revenge, I was forced to recollect all that could animate it, to be proof against this seducing Charmer; and I put a perfect violence on my Inclina∣tions, by constraining my self to do a cruel Action, after so pleasing and so extastick a one, yet such was my Fate, I must triumph, or must be triumphed over, 'tis easie to resolve, which was the Choice I made, for when I had been this happy Man, for two hours, and had very often given, and received, Testimonies of a great and reciprocal Passion, I barbarously confessed my self to be <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa; certainly, all I could have contrived, in my whole Life, of Cruel, had not been so ill re∣ceived
<PB N="101" REF="52"/>by her, as this last Action of mine, yet she continued some time very calm, and confessed, that not my Embraces had disgusted her, but my former conduct to her, which was so base, that she should eternally re∣member, and eternally endeavour to revenge; she caress'd me for the Let∣ter, which, when she saw I was re∣solved not to give her, she flew out into an extreme violent Passion, she threatned me with death, which she assured me she was resolved should be my Fate, for she would instantly inform the Grand Signior of my coming to that sacred place, in such an hour, and an hundred other ridiculous Cla∣mors, which I put an end to, by an∣swering her, <HI>Morat should suffer what∣ever the Sultan ordained me of Punish∣ment; Nay,</HI> persued I, <HI>either change your Resolution of discovering to</HI> Acmat <HI>my Crime, and your own Debauchery, or this ador'd Grand Gardener shall this hour be expiring by Poysons, or my Scimitan, or shall be strangled by Mutes: Consider, how you can bear this, and take your
<PB N="102" REF="53"/>measures accordingly.</HI> These Threats had their desired Success, the Sultana retired, very much inraged at my man∣ner of Revenge, and the more so, in that she durst not complain of me, with∣out hazarding the Life of her dear <HI>Morat.</HI> You entered some moments after, the Letter you have, by a kind of Miracle; had <HI>Homira</HI> seen it, no∣thing could have preuented your ruin, have a care how you carry your self, she will certainly have an account of all your Conduct, which will be rendered as criminal as her Wit and Malice can make it; perhaps she will too inform the Sultan of a Letter I had for you, and render us both suspected; he loyes you well enough to be jealous, (though none before could ever make him so;) the Sultaness <HI>Homira</HI> was an infamous Woman, and disgraced, because the Honour of <HI>Acmat</HI> required she should be so; he forgave her other Faults as Criminal, though not as publick as her favouring <HI>Amurath,</HI> and would not himself see, what the rest of the World easily discern'd; <HI>Tiridate</HI> and <HI>Homira</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="53"/>may ruin <HI>Indamora</HI> with the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, that <HI>Amurath</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa ru∣ined her; act then with Caution, and remember, when you have once lost the Sultan, all Endeavours will be in vain, to make him again love you; an Example of this we have in <HI>Homira,</HI> she is, beyond comparison, beautiful, so made to Charm, that it was almost a Miracle (great as her own Compo∣ser,) to think, how <HI>Acmat,</HI> of the Tem∣per he is, could ever cease from loving her, yet, nothing is more certain, than that he has: He cannot love <HI>Indamora</HI> more than he did <HI>Homira;</HI> you may, perhaps, have her Destiny, but all En∣deavours must be used to hinder that fatal Curse, banish <HI>Agustus</HI> from your Heart, for as long as he reigns there, you will not fail of being unhappy; Monarchs, like <HI>Acmat,</HI> when they give a whole Heart, expect a suitable re∣turn, and, as in Empire, so in Love, we can admit of no Compe∣titors.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="54"/>
<P>This I very well know (my Lord) replied the Sultana; but my auspici∣ous Stars have inspired me with an un∣fortunate Passion for <HI>Tiridate,</HI> before I ever knew the Sultan; I have, before now, assured you of my Passion for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; but when you placed me with the Sultana Queen, that did not disturb me so very much, I did not believe I should ever see him again, and am yet to learn how it comes that he is pro∣tected here, in this Court. Possbly I had not consented to please my Am∣bition, had I ever had any hope of be∣ing happy again in my Love; but the Object of it had, for me, suffered a Banishment, and retired to a place, where I could never have come, after my being taken and made a Slave in <HI>Turky.</HI> But, my Lord, pursued the fair Sultana, with some great Sighs, and a Torrent of Tears, <HI>I love the Prince, and cannot cease from doing it, maugre all what you, my own Reason, or the whole World, can say to the contrary; and perhaps I had rather share his Banish∣ment with him, than never see him again.
<PB N="105" REF="54"/>I first gave him my Honour, when I had no Love for him, and sure, my Lord, now I have, 'tis not to be expected I should treat him worse than than: Ah! it is too cruel a Destiny, my capricious Fates will hurry me to a thousand things, but all my Resolves terminate in loving him eter∣nally; and in this you must acquiesce, all our Sex has some weakness, this is mine, pity it then, (my Lord) and assist an un∣fortunate Woman, whose Good wholly de∣pends on your Management.</HI> I would not ask this from you, were I not as∣sured it is your Interest I should live in the Favour of the Grand Signior; and further, (my Lord) you have hi∣therto protected and assisted me, leave me not now, in the greatest moment of my life. I would, without your aid, leave the Seraglio, confess my Passion to the Sultan for <HI>Tiridate A∣gustus,</HI> and declare to him the desire I should have of passing my whole life with him, remote from every thing but Love; but I flatter my self, that with your assistance, and by the As∣cendent I have over <HI>Acmat,</HI> I may con∣tinue
<PB N="106" REF="55"/>as I am. I have some Ambition with me, the Sultan gratifies it, and I must acknowledge it, though he is a Monarch very indifferent to me; and I know not what I could be capable of doing against him, should he make my life uneasie by disturbing my love. To prevent it, I must endeavour to preserve my selfe, in his Opinion, as guiltless of persidiousness as I am now in it.</P>
<P>She stopt here, to make room for the Returns of the Grand Visier, who represented to her all she had to fear from that manner of Conduct, the Life of the Christian Religious, and her own; (but those are things which Love renders but little persuasive, and we very often hazard them to satisfie the humours of the God.) <HI>Mahomet</HI> Bassa at least persuaded the Sultana to carry her self with more Caution than usual, and to pretend more Passion and Tenderness for <HI>Acmat</HI> than ever. Af∣ter this the Grand Visier retired, the day began to break, and to tarry lon∣ger
<PB N="107" REF="55"/>would be hazardous, if he were known.</P>
<P>The fair Sultana was agitated by unexpressible Disquiets; she returned to the Seraglio, and with a Resolu∣tion to write to the Religious Prince, which she did, but then she knows not how to have it safely delivered to him. What the Grand Visier had said to her, alarmed her; she had reason to apprehend all things from <HI>Homira,</HI> who, upon very good Considerations, she could not believe any thing but ill Of∣fices could proceed from.</P>
<P>She must then use as much precau∣tion as could be consistent with her Love for the Prince, that being dearer to her than her Ambition; she belie∣ved <HI>Acmat</HI> was secure in the Opinion of her sincerity, her truth, and the Protestations she had made him, and that more than suspicions would be ne∣cessary to ruin her, it was her fault if Indiscretion did it; she has a thousand Designs forming for the Conveyance of this Letter she had writ; she knows not whom to trust, she fears all things
<PB N="108" REF="56"/>from every one in the Seraglio. <HI>Acmat</HI> was the most beloved by his Subjects of any Prince under the Heavens; all that had the Grace to approach him were charmed with his easie Conversa∣tion, in which he always exprest a∣bundance of Wit; and for those that were not permitted to be so nearly serviceable, they were retained by a thousand Liberalities He was the most Generous of all men, and never in his life denied any thing that was asked him, though it was the same thing by several persons; he gave it to all, and let them agree whose it were. All those in the Seraglio seem∣ed so devoted to his particular Inter∣est, that it was an emulation amongst them who should serve him most, even in indifferent things; and whatever was newly acted or said, was instantly recounted to him. The Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> was not to learn this; she once resolved to take her self Eunuch's Ha∣bit, and pass to the Apartment of <HI>Ti∣ridate</HI> under that Disguise; but all her people being affected, as I have obser∣ved,
<PB N="109" REF="56"/>she found none in whom she might place a Confidence; her Dis∣guise was not possible to be assumed so privately as none was to know of it, and she does not see where to find that one, so that by consequence she could not tell how to escape Censure and Ruin. She must then quit that Reso∣lution, and resolve on somthing more possible; she has greater designs than the Delivery of a Letter; that is but an imperfect Happiness: She then tears that she writ, resolves on another Stratagem. She feigns herself all on a sudden desperately ill, commands the Sultan to be told of it in such a man∣ner as should express the greatest dan∣ger. <HI>Acmat</HI> lov'd her beyond his Em∣pires, and flies with all the haste and terror of a passionate Lover, who would see his Mistress before she left the World. <HI>Indamora</HI> was assured of his Approach, and prepared to receive him in a condition the most moving of all, by terrible Swoonings and Con∣vulsions, that <HI>Acmat,</HI> all desperate at her appearance of so eminent danger,
<PB N="110" REF="57"/>gave a very loud Cry; this she pre∣tends to hear, and, as if raised by it from a deep Lethargy which her faint∣ings had left her in, she called those about her, Barbarous, in disturbing that Repose she was going to find in Death. <HI>Acmat,</HI> at her pronouncing that name, fell on his Knees by her Bed, and conjured her not to think yet of any thing but Life: She turn∣ed to the Sultan, and with that little Force that was left her, endeavour'd to raise him from the Ground, and made him sit by her on the Bed: Then she ordered all in the Room to retire, and addrest herself thus to him, in a very low Voice,</P>
<P><HI>You and Heaven, Sir, are sensible with how much Faithfulness I have loved you, and how much I was beloved again; I see my self possess a Rank which would satisfie the most immense Ambition: But, Ah! my dear Sultan,</HI> added she with tenderness, <HI>it was not to gratifie that D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire I became what I am; it was to sa∣tisfie a more refin'd Passion; you inspir'd me with too tender Sentiments to deny
<PB N="111" REF="57"/>yours and my own happiness; but, Oh! how have I served my God by this grati∣fying my Criminal Passions? I must dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Sir, and be accountable for all my weak∣nesses; nay, my Sin is more, I am so ob∣stinate that I cannot repent of what gave us so much Pleasure as our Engagements; I call Heaven to Witness, they bounded all my Felicities and all my Ambition, my Wishes and Desires of satisfying Love and Glory were there terminated: But in the Condition I am in now, 'tis requisite, I banish the memory of that Happiness, and apply my self after the Pursuit of a more durable, though not a more transporting one, of another nature. In all appearance, I have not many hours to survive this, in which I speak to you.</HI> Here she lost her Voice again, and swooned in the Arms of the Sultan: He called the Attendants to her Aid, and yet suf∣fered none to touch her; he fancied that Service, which was requisite to be rendred her, ought to be accom∣plished by none but himself; he then chaffed her, prest her in his Arms, sigh'd, wept, and in short, commit∣ted
<PB N="112" REF="58"/>a thousand Extravagancies, which were notwithstanding pardonable in a Lover. In such extremity of An∣guish, <HI>Ah! too lovely, and too dear</HI> In∣damora, (would he cry, all trans∣ported with despair) <HI>you must not leave your Monarch thus, but I shall shortly follow; my Life is inseparable with hers; Hear me,</HI> Mahomet, <HI>and if thou hast a design to continue me thy Friend, restore me to Life and Health my dear Sultana. Indamora</HI> would now rise from her Swoon, she believed she had remained long enough in it, so that fetching two great Sighs, she opened her Eyes with a dead Languor, and, in a Mo∣ment after, closed 'em again. <HI>Acmat</HI> was not able to suffer this cruelty; he repeated his Outcry, and snatched her with great violence nearer him, as if by that Action he designed to hinder her from expiring. This gave her a good Pretence; she seemed startled at this emotion, and opening her Eyes, she clos'd 'em no more again for that time. The Sultan, transported at so pleasing an Object, ordered the At∣tendants
<PB N="113" REF="58"/>Absence, till he should call them again; and turning to her with symptoms of joy for her Recovery, which did not however last long; for asking of her, <HI>How she was now,</HI> and receiving no Answer, absolutely be∣lieved she was Speechless; he was now despairing, and in a very little of be∣ing in earnest, what she feign'd.</P>
<P>But all this had not effected what she aimed at; she thinks it's now time to begin, so that raising her head with an apparent Constraint, and in fainter Accents than before, with Interruptions and Tears, she pro∣ceeds thus to the Grand Signior. I must now (Sir,) take my farewel of this World, or to speak more pro∣perly of you, you being alone in the Room of all things to me; but as my time, (which I very well perceive is short) so must my Discourse be; I must employ some of my hasty mo∣ments to the reconciling my self to my God, whom I have every way offend∣ed. I know you love me, above your Crowns, above your own Life; and
<PB N="114" REF="59"/>I flatter my self, were it possible to save mine, by the loss of yours, you would not fail to give me that Sacri∣fice. <HI>Acmat</HI> having assur'd her with passionate Asseverations, of the cer∣tainty of what she said, she proceeded thus: But as that could not fail of killing me with Grief and Sorrow, so I should not suffer it, this I say to as∣sure you I know how dear I am to you; all I have now to recommend to your care, is the preservation of your own Person; next, Sir, I bear my loss with patience, the good. Gods will send another in my room, to possess the Affection, I could never merit, and she shall be as dear to you, as I am now. Ah! That is impossible, re∣plied he, with a transporting sorrow. Well, my (dear Prince) continued she, since you say so, I will believe; but remember what I shall tell you, Deny not your self all the Diversions possible, I flatter my self, my Death may some sort make 'em necessary, since the only way, to expel a great Melancholy (such as yours) is by
<PB N="115" REF="59"/>Pleasures. And next, Oh Heavens! cried she, as if torn with extremity of anguish, retire, and let me not die more full of torture by seeing, what a world of pain, my death will cost you; Ah, my dear Prince, fare∣well. Here she gave way, for the Sultan to lament her in the tenderest manner of regret. You love me, says she, (just as if expiring) convince me of it, in Death; and as the last, and greatest service, you can render to a Woman so dear to you, take some care of my everlasting Welfare, send to me the Prince <HI>Tiridate Agu∣stus,</HI> he is of my Religion, we were acquainted in the Emperors Court, I hear he is now in yours, I cannot die, but despairing, if I do not see him, 'tis necessary for my Eternal Happi∣ness, I receive from him Absolution; 'tis long since, you allowed my Reli∣gion, you have now no room for won∣der, at a desire, so consistent with it.</P>
<P><HI>Acmat</HI> believing Obedience was tho greatest Testimony of his Affection, went to the Anti-Chamber, where
<PB N="116" REF="60"/>the Attendants were in waiting, and ordered one of the Eunuchs to fly to the Holy Christian Prince, and to com∣mand him instantly to come to the dy∣ing Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> (to whom, af∣ter these words given,) he return'd, she said no more, pretended to be faln into a deep Lethargy, he kneel'd by her, kiss'd her a thousand times, and uttered all, that a violent Sorrow, and a great Passion, could inspire, shed a torrent of Tears upon her Face, and flattered himself, (by the heat he found there,) she was not yet expiring: It is almost a Miracle, how the Sultana could deceive him, as she did; but the Bed-Chamber was wholly darkened, and he the most Amorous, and blind∣est, of all Princes.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Agustus</HI> having received those Orders from the Ottoman Em∣peror, was divided, if he should obey, (since the cruel Disappointment the night before,) but his Charity, and his Religion, (as it ought,) surmount∣ed all particular Considerations, and he followed the Eunuch to her Apart∣ments;
<PB N="117" REF="60"/>the Sultan retired at the sight of him, and caused himself to be con∣ducted to his own, where he passed his time the most deplorably imaginable; it is easie to imagin, the Sultana con∣tinued not long in that appearance of danger, when she saw none present but her dear Prince, (for whom she had feign'd as she did,) he approach∣ed the Bed with some amaze, <HI>The Great God is Just</HI> (said he,) <HI>to punish so im∣mediately thy Perjuries to me! but this is not a time to upbraid you, 'tis convenient, for your eternal repose, you repent of them. But is it possible,</HI> cry'd he, some mo∣ments after, <HI>that</HI> Indamora, <HI>that Charm∣ing Creature, should be so near leaving this World; 'tis absurd to believe, so great a Miracle in Nature should cease to be, so early.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You prophesie right,</HI> return'd she, in raising her Head, <HI>and</HI> Indamora <HI>is not yet to leave this World, and her unjust</HI> Tiridate, <HI>for whom I have feigned this Indisposition. Do not you see I love you, I abandon my Sultan to assure you of it, and it is with some Difficulty, I have ob∣tained
<PB N="118" REF="61"/>your Presence here. Ah!</HI> inter∣rupted he her, <HI>I am convinced, maugre all the former Appearances to the contrary: But,</HI> persued he a moment after, <HI>Why did you disappoint me in the Garden? And, Why did not you answer my Letter, I sent you? Indamora</HI> satisfied him of the Letter, recounted to him all that had happened in the Garden of the <HI>Serag∣lio,</HI> the preceding night, and further assured him, that she recall'd and re∣pented of all her Cruelty to him, in the Court of the German Emperor; that she forgave him the Death of <HI>Al∣cander,</HI> since it was for the Love of her; and, in short, all his unjust Suspicions of her too.</P>
<P>The Prince had nothing now to doubt, but, made the most bless'd of all Men, had leisure to give, and re∣ceive, Protestations of an inviolable Fidelity, and to compose their Quar∣rel, in a Charming manner.</P>
<P>He assured her, that it was for the Love of her, that he came to <HI>Constan∣tinople;</HI> learnt her the Sorrow of the Great Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="61"/>when she had heard of her being made a Slave, and press'd her to take some measures for the seeing one ano∣ther for the future; it was impossible for him to visit her again, unsuspected. <HI>Indamora</HI>'s Malady was represented as a violent Poyson, and of consequence, since it was not to kill, she must reco∣ver as soon as her pretended Distem∣per required.</P>
<P>The fair Sultaness demanded some time to consider of what was to be done for their mutual repose, and as∣sured him, she would find out some way, to give him Notice, when she had resolved what ought to be done; the Prince kiss'd her Hand, as a Pledge of his eternal Passion, and left her to go tell the Sultan something to satisfie him; he found him thrown on his Bed, drown'd in Tears and in despair; none, not the Grand Visier, so extremely in his Favour, was permitted to speak to him, a gloomy silence fill'd the whole Apartment; all the Eunuchs, Slaves, and Guards, had Orders not to let any enter, the Prince though found
<PB N="120" REF="62"/>it not difficult, for one of the Atten∣dants telling the Great <HI>Acmat,</HI> that the Prince <HI>Agustus</HI> was returned from the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and implored Permission to speak to him; he was presently introduced, <HI>Acmat</HI> advanced to him very hastily, and, in expressive Language, enquired News of her, and <HI>Tiridate,</HI> with abundance of Gravity, gave him this Return.</P>
<P><HI>It was some time, Sir, after I entered, ere I could possibly bring her to say any thing to me; 'till, at length, recovering from that Lethargy, wherein you left her, she discoursed me much to her Satisfaction, but in such intolerable Pains, and so weak a Voice, that I could not believe her destin'd to live an hour: Amid'st all her terrible Agonies, she often named you very tender∣ly, she sighed, when she repeated the Name of the Sultan, and appeared to have no other regret, in her quitting this World, but as she left you behind her. Twice whil'st I was by her Bed, I believed her expiring, but the Physicians say now, there is no manner of danger, they knew not at the first what ailed her, but the horrid
<PB N="121" REF="62"/>pains she suffered, her Agonies, her Swoon∣ings and her Convulsions, has assured them she has been poisoned; but her Youth and Vigour has master'd the height of it: She is put to rest, and with great hopes of Re∣covery, the extremity being already past, and we hope, most of the greatest dan∣ger:</HI></P>
<P>The Sultan was so sensibly pleas'd with this Relation, that from that Moment he began to treat the Prince in an extraordinary manner; he en∣quired of him a thousand little things, would force him to stay with him, <HI>That we may</HI> (says the great <HI>Acmat) both together visit the dear</HI> Indamora, <HI>when she shall awake.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis apparent, he had no Inclina∣tions to Jealousie, not but that the most barbarous man would have ceas'd to have been so in that point, having seen the fair Sultana in that deplora∣ble Condition the Grand Signior left her in. He attended with impatience till she should rise from her Sleep, which she really did not in two hours after the Physicians had been with
<PB N="122" REF="63"/>her, and delivered their Opinions, (as the Prince <HI>Agustus</HI> had recourted them to the Sultan) who all impa∣tient to be personally assured of her Recovery, passed to her Apartments. The Moment he was told, she awoke, it is beyond being desined the extreme Passion he exprest, the joy and plea∣sure he took in seeing her freed from her pretended Malady. The Prince, (Jealous to Madness of so much Ar∣dour,) could not but silently upbraid the unjust Sultaness for being false to a Monarch so accomplisht and so well made, as <HI>Acmat;</HI> but as it was in his advantage, he did not suffer that Reflection to disturb him long. He wish'd himself out of the Seraglio; he continued there in intolerable Dis∣quiets; 'tis true, the Grand Signior brought him again to the Chamber of <HI>Indamora,</HI> but he had not the liber∣ty to speak to that dear Princess, the Sultan so wholly applied himself to her, none could be heard besides; he pleas'd himself with recounting to her all that her appearance of danger had
<PB N="123" REF="63"/>made him suffer, learnt her the Cares, the Sighs, the Tears he shed for her, and in short, was two hours by her Bed on his Knees, and would not be persuaded to rise, but amused the time with, <HI>I love; I feard for you; I could not survive you;</HI> and a hundred other things of the same nature.</P>
<P>The Prince, during all these foole∣ries, was impatient enough; he con∣sider'd he was there but as a Witness to a thousand Transports of his Rival; but he had no reason to complain; he had been more happy not long before, and if any had reason to be dissatisfied, it was the Sultan, <HI>Indamora</HI> was only grateful to this later, and she passio∣nately loved the former.</P>
<P>After two hours, the Prince <HI>Tiri∣date</HI> was call'd to share the Conver∣sation with the Sultan and Sultana; he charm'd all with his pleasing Wit; and <HI>Acmat</HI> would often say, <HI>He regret∣ted nothing so much, as his having not been intimately acquainted before then with a Prince of his merit.</HI> This was a Grace to the amorous <HI>Tiridate,</HI> and
<PB N="124" REF="64"/>he saw every moment how much the Grand Signior favoured him, who, when he quitted the Apartment of <HI>Indamora,</HI> which could not be done without Reluctancy, being obliged to visit the Sultana Queen, he carried him with him, to present him to her, to do his Homage there.</P>
<P>The Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> was then in the Presence. <HI>Agustus</HI> had never before seen her, (nor none so beautiful as she) he was dazled with a thousand Graces, peculiar to her Divine Com∣posure, her goodly Meen, and though she had lost much of what she was, when the Mrs. of the Sultan, yet she failed not of drawing from the Prince <HI>Agustus</HI> some fighs: He was wholly confounded when she first appeared, and it was of excellent use to him, the recollecting all his Love, and all the Beauties of <HI>Indamora,</HI> to resist the Power of <HI>Homira</HI>'s. However it was, he was not Conquer'd, but retired with the Sultan only in Admiration of her.</P>
<PB N="125" REF="64"/>
<P>The Grand Signior had very well observed the Change of <HI>Tiridate</HI> when the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> appeared; he heard some tender sighs, which he believed could proceed from nothing but Ado∣ration: Nothing could give this Mo∣narch more Joy than <HI>Agustus</HI>'s Passion for <HI>Homira;</HI> he had no longer any Interest in her. though he still admi∣red her; he asked <HI>Tiridate</HI>'s opinion of her, who answered so confusedly, that the great <HI>Acmat</HI> fell a laughing: this raised the Prince from his Con∣templations, and gave him a sense of his Remisness; he would excuse him∣self to the Sultan: <HI>No, no,</HI> (said that Monarch) <HI>it needs not that; I have my self more than Adored</HI> Homira; <HI>all that see her, see her with concern, and I should wonder if you, whose Soul is amorous and great, desponded.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince, who found it not a∣gainst his Inclinations, and who be∣lieved that this pretended Passion would wholly engage the Sultan from any Jealousie of him and <HI>Indamora,</HI> an∣swered so as made the Ottoman Em∣peror
<PB N="126" REF="65"/>believe he had divined rightly, and that the Prince was sensibly affe∣cted with the Sultana <HI>Homira.</HI></P>
<P>They were passing through a great Gallery, that divides the Womens A∣partments from the Sultan's, when a Slave vail'd came up to the Prince, de∣livered him a Letter, and retired with Precipitation.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior, who was the best bred man, and the most compli∣sant, in the World, gave leave for the Prince to read it there: <HI>Who knows,</HI> says the Sultan, agreeably smiling, <HI>it may be of moment, and the Lady that sends it to you may be impatient of a Re∣turn.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tiridate</HI> trembled for <HI>Indamora,</HI> and for himself, he believed it was from her, and should he open it before the Sultan, he must observe a Civility that could not be dispensed with; <HI>Acmat</HI> must see it: The Prince then chose rather to suspend his Curiosity, and to tell the Sultan, <HI>He knew better what Respects were to be paid him, than to treat him after that manner, though he
<PB N="127" REF="65"/>was so indulgent to permit him more than he durst make advantage of.</HI></P>
<P>The Sultan wanted not Compre∣hension to divine the cause that the Prince would not open the Letter, af∣ter what he had said to him; and though he might have commanded it, he chose rather to oblige <HI>Tiridate,</HI> and remain himself unsatisfied: He rallied him for the Gallantry as must of ne∣cessity be in the Billet, since it came from the Seraglio; <HI>You are a happy man, Prince,</HI> says the Sultan, <HI>you are no sooner seen than Engagements of heart follow; some of the Women you saw on the Queens side are certainly charmed, and from thence we are not at all to doubt but this Letter proceeds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Agustus</HI> was confounded what An∣swer to make, when the Sultan, who saw the Pain he was in, very obli∣gingly order'd some of the Eunuchs to conduct him out of the Seraglio; <HI>Go, go,</HI> says <HI>Acmat, and see what Love has done for you; I expect you will be so just as to allow me some share in your Confi∣dence; I think I ought to be told some∣thing
<PB N="128" REF="66"/>of this Amour, since it was I that conducted you to the Queen Sultaness's Apartment, from whence, as I said to you before, this Billet is certainly come.</HI> Nor was he deceived; for the impa∣tient Prince was yet advanced no far∣ther than the Limits of the Womens Apartments, when he tore open the Letter, and found this Language;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>WHen you shall know, as I do not at all doubt to assure you, con∣vincingly of it, what Love has done for you, you will perhaps have reason not to think your self altogether unhappy; see what it is to have a strong Passion, one needs to see you but once, (as I have done) to be inspir'd with one; Care is taken to put the way of returning these Obliging Sentiments wholly in your Power, take an implicit Faith, you need but Love well enough, to come to morrow in the Even∣ing, (disguised like a Woman Slave) to the Grotto in the Labyrinth, in the Gar∣dens of the Seraglio, and you will be happy enough, if Love and the</HI> Sultana Homira <HI>can make you so.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<PB N="129" REF="66"/>
<P><HI>Agustus</HI> knew not whether he ought to be satisfied at his good for∣tune, he strongly admired <HI>Homira,</HI> but then his Charming Intelligence, with <HI>Indamora,</HI> represented it self to him, whereas the other was a Lover in common, unconstant, a lightness of Humour unexpressible, however ex∣tream Beautiful, and the Prince was not insensible, he believed it no in∣justice at all, to his passion for <HI>In∣damora,</HI> (since she was a president to him, in living with the <HI>Sultan</HI> in the Quality she did) if he amused himself some times with <HI>Homira,</HI> conditionally he reserved his Heart for the <HI>Sultana</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> but his last Resolution is to be guided by the command of the <HI>Sultan,</HI> since it was in a thing so ab∣solutely indifferent to his Passions, though not to his Pleasures, he re∣turned then, under the conduct of the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> to the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> As soon as the <HI>Sultan</HI> saw him, <HI>Are you come Prince</HI> (said he) <HI>to give me some man∣ner of light into a Mystery, which I would fain fancy my self concerned in,
<PB N="130" REF="67"/>since you are interess'd in it.</HI> The Prince did in return to these Obligements, give him the Letter, bowing low, and an assurance the whole was to be car∣ried on as he pleased to order it. The Sultan had but just read the Letter, when (he cried out) Ah, Prince, you are a happy Man, I prophesied right, you must follow your Inclinations, and your better Fortune, you have con∣fessed to me <HI>Homira</HI> does not displease you, and that <HI>Sultaness</HI> has given a Testimony of her Tenderness for you, we will this moment go to <HI>Indamora,</HI> you shall along with me, and relate to her this Adventure, possibly it may di∣vert her, one tastes no true pleasure in any thing till one imparts it, and receives the approbation of our Friends, and in a more extraordinary manner, those we love so well, as I do the Sultana of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tiridate</HI> would have been very well pleased, to have been excused, from doing what the Sultan had then pro∣posed, but in consideration that <HI>Inda∣mora</HI> could not love him less, for <HI>Ho∣mira</HI>'s
<PB N="131" REF="67"/>weakness, he resolv'd to follow the great <HI>Acmat</HI> to her Apartments, which in effect he did, some moments after.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sultana</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> not at all be∣lieving the <HI>Sultan</HI> would have return'd so soon, quitted her Chamber, and de∣scended the Gardens to walk: <HI>Acmat</HI> could not possibly believe it, till he was confirmed by her return; she used some slight pretence, which however satisfied the <HI>Sultan,</HI> desiring nothing beyond her health, he did perfectly drown all manner of reflection in a great joy, for the return of it, ex∣press his satisfaction in the tenderest of Languages; from that he passed to a Relation of the Amour of <HI>Homira,</HI> and all along represented <HI>Tiridate A∣gustus</HI> in Love with that Sultana. <HI>In∣damora</HI> chang'd colour very often at what had been told her, but the pre∣tence of indisposition took off all man∣ner of suspition, and gave her a plau∣sible excuse; she endeavour'd to ap∣pear pleas'd at the good fortune of the Prince, and press'd him to declare
<PB N="132" REF="68"/>what he had resolv'd on, the cruel, or the tender, part; But pursu'd she a moment after, I forget you are in Love, Prince, and I do ill to suspect you of Barbarity. I am in Love indeed, Madam, (replied he) my Chains are glorious, she whose Captive I am, and for whom I wear 'em, is so fair, that she is secure of the Conquest; I am flatter'd by her, she is not insensible, and I see nothing that can hinder me from loving her eternally; I have a passionate inclination for constancy, and think that vertue, above all others. She you love then, Prince, will be of necessity happy, (returned the fair Sultana) very well knowing <HI>Agustus</HI> spake of her self, but take heed lest I may one day accuse you, remember before whom you give your self such a marvellous Commendation, I assure you, if ever we are satisfied of your inconstancy, I will be with the first that shall upbraid you of it, I must de∣fend our Sex (Sir) continued she, ad∣dressing to the Sultan. The Prince will by his Actions, (replied <HI>Acmat</HI>)
<PB N="133" REF="68"/>(not at all suspecting they talk'd of themselves) and by his perseverance I do not question, take the part of ours better then all that can be said; to begin, he shall be at the Assignation, and my dear <HI>Sultana,</HI> since I see you dare this very day, wherein we all feared for you, venture to the Gra∣den, you shall be there with me to morrow night, to see how the Prince will manage his disguise, he has my leave to go, and perhaps we shall find a great deal of diversion in the Ad∣venture.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sultana</HI> at first resolv'd not to go there, but considering the thoughts of her being in the Garden, would possibly be an awe to inconstancy in <HI>Tiridate,</HI> she gave the <HI>Sultan</HI> an Assu∣rance of her Obedience to all his Commands, who retired some mo∣ments after with the Prince.</P>
<P><HI>Indamora</HI> had now leisure to reflect on all she had learnt, she is sensibly af∣flicted at it, she lov'd the Prince <HI>A∣gustus</HI> more than ever she had done, and abhorr'd the <HI>Sultan</HI> for promot∣ing
<PB N="134" REF="69"/>an Amour which could not be for her advantage, and she was within little of taking resolutions to revenge it on him; she fears <HI>Tiridate</HI> could not be insensible to the most beautiful of all Women, melting into tenderness for him, but if her Charms could not move him to a return, she dreads the assistance of Gratitude, (which is in∣separable from a Gallant-Man) add to all this a more prevailing Circum∣stance, he is obliged to feign a Passion, or else the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> will be dis∣abused in an opinion of his concern for the <HI>Sultana Homira;</HI> but to pre∣vent, if possible, all these cruel Appre∣hensions, she resolves to write to the Prince; The way of conveying it was no longer so difficult, he had been thrice in her Apartments that day, and once without the <HI>Sultan,</HI> she be∣lieved none of her Slaves, her Eunuchs, Women of Guards, would make any reflection, should she write to him; which she did in this manner.</P>

<P>The Letter was given in charge to a faithful Eunuch, (with express Or∣ders to deliver it into the Hands of the Prince and none other) mean time she busied her self in a thousand re∣flections, she lov'd the Prince even to the committing Crimes for his sake, and she then took Resolutions, to make any serve her that could conduce to the better fortune of this Passion, but

<P>The <HI>Sultana Homira</HI> after the Ad∣venture of <HI>Mahomet Bassa</HI> in the Gar∣dens, was transported with Rage, with design of Revenge, and yet she is not
<PB N="137" REF="70"/>displeased to find him still a Lover, yet that shall not save him from Ruin, she wants only power, and not incli∣nations, or he had not liv'd till then, to triumph over her in such a sensible manner: Nothing more offends a haughty Beauty, than to find the Man that one hates, be in a possibility of boasting of the same Favours, we give to those that are beloved: This she re∣gretted, and whilst bufie in contriving a Revenge, she let self reflect on that Billet the Eunuch had orders to deli∣ver to the <HI>Sultana</HI> of <HI>Barbary;</HI> she fancies something advantageous for her designs could be gather'd from it, she saw <HI>Indamora</HI> was no longer what she had made the whole Seraglio be∣lieve her, that she receiv'd Letters, and in short, that it was easie to ruin her.</P>
<P>She had all these Reflections in the Garden of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> ere she return∣ed to her Apartments, which she did, as incensed as she could possibly be, against a Man she so much esteem'd, under the Disguise of <HI>Morat</HI> the Grand
<PB N="138" REF="71"/>Gardener; and will see, if she can ruin the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and by that blow, put the Grand Visier from some of the Favour he retained: She begins with a Resolution of sounding the Inclinations of <HI>Indamera,</HI> she be∣lieves them of the nature of her own, since they were of the same Sex; there wants nothing then, but to know whom she Graces, that must be satisfied by <HI>Zelida,</HI> (her chief Slave,) she sends for her, makes her believe, her ruin was inevitable, that <HI>Indamora</HI> would fall, and involve her in her Misfor∣tunes, that it was her best course to take care of her self, since the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> would not do it for her; that the only means was, to acquaint the Sultan with her Mistress's Iutrigues, which he would certainly know, by those that were wiser than she should be, if she neglected that opportunity of making her Fortune for ever: But, how was <HI>Homira</HI> disappointed, when the Slave assured her, she never saw <HI>Indamera</HI> commit the least Weakness, in Advantage of any Man; but re∣tired,
<PB N="139" REF="71"/>with a Promise to the Sultana, of observing her more narrowly, for the time to come, than she had yet done; which, too satally, she did, and the same day return'd to <HI>Homira,</HI> with an account of all that had pas'd in <HI>Indamora</HI>'s Cham∣ber; during her Indisposition, <HI>Zelida</HI> had concealed her self behind a Cano∣py, over a State in the great Cabi∣net joyning the Chamber the Sultana lay in, from whence, unperceived, and with abundance of ease, she saw all that was done, she recounted the Sul∣tan's despair, her Swoonings, her Passion for the Religious Prince, and all she said and did of tender to him. <HI>Homira</HI> was pleased at this good For∣tune, but there is something that stays her, from yielding to her passionate Desires of Revenge; her own Incli∣nation, which was become tender, surmounted it; she had heard <HI>Tiridate Agustus</HI> was a since Prince, his Chara∣cter was very Glorious, she would yet see him before she ruined him, which she must of necessity do, if the Ingage∣ment between him and the fair Sulta∣na
<PB N="140" REF="72"/>of <HI>Barbary</HI> was related to the Grand Signior; she bids <HI>Zelida</HI> look for some Letters, telling the Slave, that what∣ever they could say, without Authen∣tick Testimonies to authorise it, would be of no use, and that they should themselves be the Persons exposed; this she does to divert <HI>Zelida,</HI> whom she had no mind should yet learn the Sultan any thing of the Prince <HI>Agustus, Homira</HI> knew not, if she should like him yet, or no, if her Inclinations are favourable, after seeing of him, he shall be saved; or, on the contrary, ruined with the Sultana of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P>See then, on what a slender thing the Life of <HI>Agustus</HI> depended; but it was his own Fault, he was not happy, the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> was charmed with him at the Queen Sultana's Apart∣ments, where, as has been related, the Sultan carried him: She writ that Letter (which he received in the Presence of the Great <HI>Acmat,</HI>) with a design of gaining an opportunity of entertaining him singly; she was not accustomed to be cruel, and without
<PB N="141" REF="72"/>the Inclination she had for <HI>Tiridate,</HI> the desire she had of Revenge, would have made her endeavour to oblige the Prince, as powerfully as she could, she will use all her Arts, to make him quit <HI>Indamora</HI> for her, without which they shall both fall; she will now be∣come more nice than ever, she thinks of ingaging the Heart, and will not be satisfied without the intire Possession of it, she cannot support the thought of sharing with <HI>Indamora,</HI> whom she mor∣tally hated, and whom she does not question but to ruin, if once deserted by the Prince: She is impatient to know the success of her Billet, <HI>Zelida</HI> had delivered it, and return'd to give her an account, that she had obey'd her Orders, (though not without terrible Apprehensions of the Sultan;) from thence the Slave passed to the Lodgings of the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> where the Sultan and the Prince <HI>Tiridate</HI> were al∣ready come, <HI>Zelida</HI> absconds her self, as before, and with the same ease heard all that was said; the Letter of the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> was read aloud by <HI>In∣damora,</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="73"/>and those Resolutions taken as has been before related; all which <HI>Zelida</HI> very perfectly remembered, the Slave had store of Sense, she had been placed by <HI>Acmat</HI> in the Service of the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and was very true to his Interest; it was from <HI>Homira</HI>'s Discourse she took a resolution to ob∣serve the Conduct of <HI>Indamora,</HI> which, if criminal, she believed it her Duty, to (at once,) let the Sultan see, how faithful she was, and, how undeserving of his Heart and Favours the Sultana rendered her self; she saw her write a Letter, and heard the Orders she gave the Eunuch, she contrives, how she might read it, but the diligence of the Slave, that had it in charge, prevented her, so that all she could possibly effect, was to secure the Answer, which she did thus.</P>
<P><HI>Zelida</HI> had the charge of the War∣drobe, and, as <HI>Indamora</HI> had left the Letter, it was easie to get it, she had loosed her self to be put to Bed, some short time after receiving it, <HI>Zelida</HI> be∣ing very diligent, waited so effectu∣ally,
<PB N="143" REF="73"/>that the Robes the Sultana wore that day, (and which the Letter was in,) were immediately put into her hands, she retired with it to the Sul∣tana <HI>Homira;</HI> 'tis beyond expression the Passion of this Princess, at the reading it; <HI>Ah, Traytor!</HI> (says she,) <HI>Perjured Villain! Unhappy</HI> Homira— <HI>but I will be revenged— And yet,</HI> (per∣sued she, a moment after,) <HI>Who knows, and, who dare trust, Appearances; not∣withstanding this Letter, this Prince, per∣haps, loves me, and it is writ but to sa∣tisfie the Sultana of</HI> Barbary, <HI>he can do no less, we must appease her — To morrow will put a Period to all these Disputes, and then I shall see, which it is he loves.</HI> With these Reflections and Irresolu∣tions, she pass'd the night, and the following day, 'till the hour came of the Assignation; she failed not to ren∣der her self at the <HI>Grotto</HI> of the Laby∣rinth, much sooner than <HI>Agustus</HI> did, and had thrown her self on one of the Seats of Turf, and, leaning her Head upon her Arm, scarce raised it up when the Prince entered, disguised,
<PB N="144" REF="74"/>like a Woman Slave, the Sultana re∣solved yet to dissemble, ('till it should be of use to her,) she having seen the Letter he had writ to <HI>Indamora.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Homira</HI> believed, she had already made Advances enough, she would now dissemble a Modesty, very unne∣cessary, after what Incouragement she had given, and took a Pleasure in per∣plexing him, which she did, by not speaking, or, pretending to know him, at first; he was surprised at this Usage, and let fall some words, as expressed his mistake, and his Fear of displeasing her, by his Intrusion, and was going to use that pretext for retiring; this put an end to all the Comedy in Play, she hastily rose, and reiterating, <HI>Stay, Stay;</HI> and after his return, <HI>Ah, Prince,</HI> (crys she,) <HI>Must one do all ones self? And, Are you stupid? What has Respect to do with Love? — Agustus</HI> knew not what to answer her, he repented him of the Promise he had made to <HI>Inda∣mora,</HI> and wished he had not obeyed the Sultana's Orders, by coming to the Gardens, where he had nothing to do,
<PB N="145" REF="74"/>but to hear himself reproved, up∣braided, and railed at.</P>
<P><HI>Homira</HI> seeing him muse so much, divined the Cause, and no longer slat∣tering her self, that he loved her, in a languishing despair, she let her self sink into his Arms, <HI>Ah, ingrateful</HI> (says she, with some great sighs,) <HI>Must</HI> Homira <HI>be then treated after this manner? Why do you torture me thus, by a scornful Silence?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tiridate,</HI> at that Action of hers, felt a remorse for his Cruelty, and ha∣ving in his Arms a Woman of the most Beauty, that had been ever pos∣sess'd by any, found it not in his Power, to continue that restraint to his Desires; he spoke tenderly to her, excused his Silence, and bid her attri∣bute it to his great Passion for her; press'd her in his Arms, (where she lay,) sighed a thousand times to her, the most passionate of Transports, and was at the point of being very faithless to the Promise he had made <HI>Indamora.</HI></P>
<PB N="146" REF="75"/>
<P>The Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> seeing <HI>Tiridate</HI> no longer insensible, was first resolved to see, if he would sacrifice <HI>Indamora</HI> to her, before she favoured him, and using some very obliging Reproaches to him, at length exposed the Letter he had writ to the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and, in a more serious Air, read it to him; after she had done, she rose from him, and taking still more Cold∣ness, mingled with some Rage, See there, says she, has not <HI>Homira</HI> all the reason in the World, to revenge the Injury thou dost her? Oughtest thou, Barbarian, to have exposed me, and the truest of Passions, to the scorn of that Sultaness? Nothing thou can'st do can merit a Pardon. Ingrateful Prince, (persued she, drying some Tears that fell from her fine Eyes,) What wilt thou say to excuse this, so cruel a Crime? But (interrupted the Prince,) and kneeling before her, Do not you see you have such an Ascen∣dant over me, as to make me break through all the Oppositions, the Vows, and the Resolutions, made in this fa∣tal
<PB N="147" REF="75"/>Letter, to your Arms? Yes, says <HI>Homira,</HI> more calmly, (and with some Tenderness,) I do see it, and am plea∣sed enough at it; there is one thing you must do, to attone for your Sin to me, 'tis wholly in your Power to deface as much as the remembrance of it, yield to me the Interest the Sul∣tana of <HI>Barbary</HI> has in thee, assist me to ruin her, and then you may be happy, in the Possession of a Princess, who tenderly loves you.</P>
<P>The Prince rose from before her, (where he was kneeling,) very coldly, 'tis true, she had pleased him, as a Mistress, that one is not obliged to be constant to, and for whom we will do very little, beyond loving them when we are with them; yet, after what she had said of <HI>Indamora,</HI> he looked on her with Contempt and Indignation, and though he knew ve∣ry well, that (for his Preservation,) he ought to dissemble with her, yet she had startled him, by so cruel a Proposition, that it was not in his Power to answer her any thing; she
<PB N="148" REF="76"/>knew what to attribute his silence to, and, becoming extremely incensed against him, she lost, in a moment, all the Tenderness she had for him, to give place to the Emotions of Anger and revenge, she pass'd from a warm Passion to a violent hatred, and (as a Testimony of it,) she stamp'd fu∣riously; You shall both dye, (says she,) <HI>Homira</HI> will have it so; you shall know what it is to scorn a Woman, haughty, like me, and one that can revenge her self; I will instantly inform the abused Sultan of your guilty commerce with <HI>Indamcra,</HI> he is this moment in the Gardens, as I am assured, and if he does not order thy Death, he will be more merciful than thou deservest. At the end of this she hastily ran out of the Labyrinth, <HI>Agustus</HI> persued her, to throw himself at her Feet, and to endeavour to mitigate her Anger; she had reason for it, and he could not much condemn her; he resolved to dissemble with her, and to make her a Sacrifice, to appease her, of his Pas∣sion to <HI>Indamcra;</HI> this he would do to
<PB N="149" REF="76"/>Appearance, any thing rather than see his dear Sultana expire, (by the Orders of the Sultan,) for his sake, he will then feign, and flatter the Pride, the Revenge, and Passion of <HI>Homira,</HI> but it is to prevent the ruin and death of himself, and his Charm∣ing <HI>Indamora.</HI></P>
<P>He look'd, he ran, he searched, he goes, he comes, but all in vain, she was lost in the Labyrinth, and the Prince, being utterly unacquainted with it, despaired of finding her, and growing extremely weary with seek∣ing, he threw himself down, (on the border of a little Rivulet, at the En∣trance of a retired <HI>Grotto,</HI> he had not been there long, agitated with all the Horrors of despair, than that he is seized behind, he startled at the Acti∣on, and was more surprized, when he saw it was the Sultan, that held him, he did not doubt, but that he was their to dye, and that <HI>Homira</HI> had conduct∣ed <HI>Acmat</HI> there, to give him the death which she threatened him with; he was at a loss, how to speak to the Grand
<PB N="150" REF="77"/>Signior, in such a Conjuncture, when that Monarch banish'd all his Fears, (by a Charming Smile peculiar to him,) <HI>Where have you left the Sultana</HI> Homira? (says he,) <HI>If I mistake not, this manner of Carriage is not at all obliging to a Princess of her Sentiments. Agustus</HI> was reassured, by what the Sultan had said, and taking an Air that expressed his Resentments; <HI>Ah, (Sir,)</HI> return'd he, <HI>You have exposed me; I know not the man∣ner, how Love was made in</HI> Turky, <HI>I believed it the same as in</HI> Germany, <HI>where, after receiving such a Letter,</HI> (<HI>as I did from</HI> Homira,) <HI>we expected all should be given, and, if we stay'd to ask it, it is only to save the Blushes of the fair one, not that those Formalities are neces∣sary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But I am yet to learn, what is to be done with the Ladies in</HI> Turky, <HI>what Court, what Address, to charm: The Sultana</HI> Homira <HI>laughed at me, ridi∣culed me, and, in a word, is fled from me, I persued her, 'till I had no longer any hopes of finding her; and see too plain∣ly, I serve only to divert you, and that
<PB N="151" REF="77"/>fantastical Sultaness; but 'tis very well I am capable of doing that. Acmat</HI> smiled all the while as <HI>Agustus</HI> was talking to him, and seeing him appear so concerned, made him laugh more than ever; but that pass'd, He ex∣amined the Prince seriously, the occa∣casion of <HI>Homira</HI>'s Flight, after the tender Letter she had writ; <HI>Tiridate</HI> would be more and more in a pet, at what the Sultan said; <HI>You laugh, (Sir,)</HI> replied he, <HI>and you inquire into a thing, which you already understand much better than I, and you must give me leave to think, you press me, only, that you believe it more diverting recounted by him, that ought not to be without Resentment, but I am ready to give you that Satisfaction. Homira,</HI> amid'st all my Protestations of Love, would shew, how well she could act a part enjoyn'd her; she pre∣tends then to be jealous of me and the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> (whom I have not seen but once since my arrival to <HI>Turky,</HI>) protests it is true, and that I am be∣loved again; and she left me, as she said, in order to find you, that my
<PB N="152" REF="78"/>death should immediately follow the Discovery. This ramble, as the Sul∣tan believed it, delivered in the Dress and Anger the Prince was in, made <HI>Acmat</HI> laugh more than ever he had done. <HI>To satisfie you,</HI> (said that Mo∣narch,) <HI>I will my self go search the Gar∣dens, and bring the Sultana</HI> Homira <HI>to you, and we will endeavour to make you Friends; you shall go into this</HI> Grotto, <HI>where</HI> Indamora <HI>is alone, and entertain her with the Relation of this nights Ad∣venture, while I shall do as I promised.</HI> Homira <HI>may then indeed, (Sir,)</HI> return'd Agustus, <HI>pretend some colour for her Jea∣lousie. Oh, ridiculous!</HI> (replied the Sultan,) <HI>Do as I command, I am assured of</HI> Indamora; <HI>and, as for</HI> Homira, <HI>I will go this moment, and bring that Sulta∣ness to you, as I said.</HI></P>
<P>Whil'st the Grand Signior was in persuit of <HI>Homira,</HI> the Prince entered the <HI>Grotto,</HI> where <HI>Indamora</HI> was, he had just leisure to assure her he had been constant, learnt her what they had to fear from <HI>Homira,</HI> the Letter she had, and the design, and the de∣sire,
<PB N="153" REF="78"/>she express'd to ruin them; at the end of this hasty Relation, <HI>Aomat</HI> entered the <HI>Grotto</HI> alone; <HI>I have found</HI> Homira, says he, <HI>but it is impossible for me to persuade her to come hither, she still persists in the same Story, and has given me the greatest Satisfaction of Laughing extremely at her ridiculous ramble; she is Obstinacy it self; tells me, that your dan∣gerous Malady yesterday was all feign'd, that it was only to favour</HI> Tiridate A∣gustus, <HI>and more, as impertinent as this.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis very necessary, Sir, replied the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> I clear my self from that Aspersion; the Sultaness thinks all her Sex of her own Inclina∣tions, because the Religious cannot escape her Conquest; she believes, (and she has perhaps some reason,) that I would no more scruple to have a Gallant Intrigue with the Prince <HI>Ti∣ridate,</HI> than she with the Mufty; but ah! all Religons will not allow it, <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> differ in nothing more, than in that point; when we ingage our selves once, it is for ever,
<PB N="154" REF="79"/>and though nothing can be more ar∣dent and constant, than our Loves, yet do we not proceed to Poysonings, and Death; the Sultan apprehends the occasion the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> said this from, she had insinuated to him her Fears, that was grounded on Cir∣cumstances convincing, of <HI>Hemira</HI>'s inveterate malice; she believed (she said,) and not without reason, that the Poyson, she had taken, proceeded from her, and I am not to wonder at this last effect of her Malice, (persued <HI>Inda∣mora;</HI>) and, ah! Sir, should you suffer these Outrages so near the Throne, it is time for the unhappy Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> to retire her self, when she is no longer loved; for what can be more cruel, than your unjust Suspitions; and if <HI>Homira,</HI> by rendering me cul∣pable, can advance her own Interest, how cruel Apprehensions ought I to have, she will pause at nothing to ruin me, and to regain your Heart, give it her then, Sir, if I no longer merit it, I had much rather be unhappy, than render you so; Is your Passion for
<PB N="155" REF="79"/>me dead? Or, Is it become so lan∣guid, that you can possibly calmly hear my Innocence, and my best Acti∣ons, aspersed with the blackest of Ca∣lumnies, and not shew your Resent∣ments? Good Heavens! How unhap∣py is <HI>Indamora,</HI> in losing her dear Sul∣tan, so tenderly, a showre of Tears succeeded; it was a long time before she could be appeased, the Great <HI>Ac∣mat</HI> endeavoured it very unsuccess∣fully, 'till he protested to her, he would never believe to her disadvan∣tage, whatever <HI>Homira</HI> could say; I have more than once fear'd for you, says he, and that haughty Spirit can∣not bear Injuries without revenging them; it is possible the Poyson that you took, and which had almost cost me my Life, was the effect of her ma∣licious Humor, but we know what Reasons she has to hate you, and her Resentments must be pardoned, since they have such a motive.</P>
<P>After this, they retired out of the Gardens, the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> had actually related to the Sultan all she
<PB N="156" REF="80"/>knew of the Intrigue of <HI>Indamora</HI> and <HI>Agustus,</HI> but the Relation that that Prince had before made to <HI>Acmat,</HI> hin∣dered her designs from taking effect, he believed her fantastically mad, and used her accordingly, by ridiculing all she said; <HI>No, (Sir,)</HI> says she, <HI>you will never believe, though you should find her in the Arms of the Religious, which is easie enough to be seen. Good Heavens!</HI> (persued she,) <HI>How could I love that ingrateful Prince, that sacrifices me to</HI> Indamora. This last Expression made an end of ruining her designs, the Sul∣tan believed, he had then found the rise of all her Extravagancies, and that it was Jealousie disordered her, and that <HI>Agustus</HI> having given the Letter she had written to <HI>Indamora,</HI> had created all these <HI>Chimera</HI>'s. Thus he returns, (as has been observed, af∣ter pitying the distracted Sultana, (as he call'd her,) and all the Absurdities she had been guilty of: This made an end of inraging <HI>Homira,</HI> she saw the Sultan was so prepossess'd to the con∣trary, that she deferred giving him
<PB N="157" REF="80"/>the Letter <HI>Agustus</HI> had sent to the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> she assured her self, if she should shew it him, he would scarcely read it, and, at best, believe it a thing feign'd on purpose, to give credit to all what she had said, which <HI>Tiridate</HI> had address enough to improve, by disowning he had ever writ it, and the Sultan who so passionately desired to find the sair <HI>Indamora</HI> innocent, would not indea∣vour to disapprove him, this <HI>Homira</HI> sees, her rage had left her sense e∣nough to give the success the Letter should find to <HI>Zelida,</HI> to order most advantageous, and she is going to in∣struct her, in the part she is to Act, for the ruin of the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and the Prince <HI>Tiridate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zelida,</HI> fully persuaded of the faith∣lessness of <HI>Indamora,</HI> prepared to dis∣charge her Conscience, by telling the Grand Signior all she knew, <HI>Homira</HI> animated her the most she could, re∣turned her the Letter, Iearnt her the unsuccessfulness of the discovery she had made, and, in short, concluded,
<PB N="158" REF="81"/>that a great deal of Cunning would be necessary to convince the Sultan of a truth obvious to all the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and that it would be more discreet for <HI>Zelida</HI> to defer yet some five days longer the Relation of that they had resolved on; that mean time, they should perhaps make some other dis∣coveries, but if they failed of that, <HI>Zelida</HI> said she did not at all question but that the Sultan would believe one that had been ever so just to him, as she had been.</P>
<P>The Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> was become deplorably Melancholy, and after what the Prince had related to her in the Garden of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> she began to consider to what unhappiness her trans∣porting Passion for him did expose her, yet she cannot repent of what she had done, she loves too ardently for such a weakness; on the contrary she will add to her Favours, her Tenderness con∣quers her Ambition, and she resolves with her self, that it is better to live retired and happy, than the most glo∣ricus Princess in the World, to suffer
<PB N="159" REF="81"/>such inquietude and constraints as she did, she casts her self then at the Sul∣tans Feet, begs his leave for her to re∣tire from the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and from <HI>Turky,</HI> pretends Religion and Remorse of Conscience, her late dreadful Malady, which had given her a prospect of Death, and of an Everlasting Estate, and said she should employ the re∣mainder of her Life, to attain a Blest Eternity, and that the Ingagements she was in with him were not at all con∣sistent with it; that it was very true, it was the greatest Temporal Felicity she could have, but then her Eternal Happiness was sacrific'd to him; And, added she, I will never believe you love me, if you can so easily for some short moments of Satisfactions, and those of so Criminal a Nature, doom your <HI>Indamora</HI> to an Everlasting rest of Tor∣ments; Remember I have hitherto neglected all reflections of this nature, and suffer'd all my remorse of Con∣science to be calm'd by your Love, but my late miraculous preservation has awakned me, and let me see, I cannot
<PB N="160" REF="82"/>continue in the same station, without appearing highly Criminal to my God; My Religion has suffered all manner of persecution for my Love, and I may say, it has even dy'd in your Arms, it is time then for me to alter so deadly and so charming a manner of living; And, Oh Gods! (added she, as if transported) Why were we born with Inclinations proper to distinguish and affect the Pleasures of this Life, and not have the liberty of Soul (given us) to enjoy 'em, without such endless Rewards of Torment? I would fain persuade my self, there are none of these things to fear, but my babling Conscience cries alowd against all these Endeavours, and in a moment crushes my Objections into nothing, and as∣sures me too fatally of the certainty of it; You your self, nor all your Love (call'd to your aid) could not boast of more Eloquence, (towards the con∣suting of these Truths) than I have suggested (by favour of those Inter∣vals, I would forcibly allow my self to snatch from Religion) to the advan∣tage
<PB N="161" REF="82"/>of you, (Sir) and to the advan∣tage of our Passion; but alas, must I pronounce the Sentence of my own Death, death of Love and Joy? Ah! 'tis too cruel a destiny, unhappy <HI>Indamo∣ra,</HI> in that she must obey; Oh, never, never, cry'd the <HI>Sultan,</HI> taking her in his Arms, Would you destroy (not only the Repose) but Life of <HI>Acmat?</HI> You take the way that will certainly do it, and if the sacrifice of it can be pleasing, bring me Poysons, offer me Poniards, or whatever way you com∣mand for dying, and you shall be sa∣tisfied, that it is necessary for me to ex∣pire by one of them, 'ere quit the pos∣session of you; It is a truth, that per∣haps this Action will be accounted Bar∣barous, but who is it that the Otto∣man Emperor can fear, but <HI>Indamora,</HI> that Charming Cruelty; Ah, what is it you cause me of <HI>torture,</HI> I am greatly miserable, it is not out of sentiments of Religion, but your aversion to me, that you would leave me, how vastly unfortunate I am, but though I were assur'd you no longer lov'd me, yet
<PB N="162" REF="83"/>should not that be of any advantage to you, you should see what a wretched <HI>Monarch,</HI> and in love like me, were ca∣pable of, I would not be unhappy a∣lone, I would detain you in the <HI>Sera∣glio,</HI> and constrain you to Embrace a Monarch indifferent to you, while I shall share your Afflictions, by consi∣dering that I am so; Let me then once forget the tenderness of a <HI>Lover,</HI> and assume to me the Majesty of a <HI>King,</HI> by assuring you, I will hear no more of any thing of such a cruel nature, 'tis altogether in vain ever to reassume your Desires, and be satisfied Love has render'd it impossible for me to live without you. This restraint serves to make the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> hate the Love, and the Person, of the Grand Signior, and after that what Crimes is not she capable of committing, she endeavours secretly to escape, and with her dear <HI>Agustus</HI> to retire into some part of the World, where they might uncontrouledly be happy in their Love, but she finds it impossible for her to fly, and then began to take more fatal Resolutions.</P>

<P><HI>Acmat</HI> fearing she should endeavour her escape (for Conscience sake) af∣ter he had denied her her liberty, he put the ways of it so wholly out of her power, and yet not as immediately proceeding from him, but as a thing barely customary, that she must sus∣pend that design, he had sent her some moments after the refusal of her li∣berty, immense Presents, and a Letter all tenderness, which you may see here.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>'TIs impossible for me, my dear</HI> Sul∣tana, <HI>to know, how it is that I came to love you so tenderly as I do, ah you are more charming than ever yet I saw any, and I know no torment either in this Life, or that to come, which I would not joyfully submit to, for the possessing you an hour; Your Conversation, your Person, your Humour, and in fine a thousand other Charms, are anvaluable, and when the mo∣ment comes, that I am at any time hurried from you, I would give all that I had dear besides, to continue with you, though per∣haps I have passed a great many hours there, but ever my heart remains behind,
<PB N="164" REF="84"/>and when distant from you, I appear but as the shadow of</HI> Acmat, <HI>let this and</HI> Mahomet <HI>be my witness, how tender you are to me; satisfie your self, my dearest</HI> Sultana, <HI>my Cares and my Empires shall be sacrificed to you, ah, why have you de∣manded the only thing I could refuse you? Why do not you ask the Crown on the Head of the</HI> Sultana Queen, <HI>rather than what you did? it would not have been so diffi∣cult for me to have seen you obeyed, I would be content to hazard my Glory, the Love of my Subjects, and, in short, my Crowns, to please you, but this is too cruel a fate, see how vastly great my Passion is, regulate yours by it, and do not repine, at the hap∣piness of your Sultan.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>After this, he visited her again; she had learnt, That it was best to dissem∣ble her Rage and her Aversion, and that without it she could I not be able to effect any thing considerable, so that it was not difficult for the great <HI>Acmat</HI> to reconcile her in appearance to his Love; he is so well satisfied with it, that nothing could make him more,
<PB N="165" REF="84"/>and he leaves her with greater Testi∣monies of his Passion, than ever he had yet done.</P>
<P>But the fatal time was now come, that <HI>Zelida</HI> was to make those Disco∣veries to <HI>Acmat. Agustus</HI> (that amo∣rous Prelate) had not seen <HI>Indamora</HI> since the night in the Garden of the Seraglio, which was an Age in Love, and which render'd her impatient, and confirm'd her in the Resolves of Sacrificing all things to her love for him. <HI>Zelida</HI> had no more testimony of their Commercce than before; but with that she adventures to the Sultan, prostrates her self at his feet, (as the custom of those Slaves is,) gave him a full account of what <HI>Homira</HI> had be∣fore confusedly related to him, put the Letter of the Christian Prince in∣to his hands, and retired.</P>
<P>The Sultan read it with an infinite surprize, he weigh'd all Circumstan∣ces, and could conclude nothing; he endeavoured to clear the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and his Passion inspir'd him with Eloquence in her Defence; but
<PB N="166" REF="85"/>then he would say her desire of quit∣ting the Seraglio was a Proof of her Indifferencie to him, and <HI>Zelida</HI>'s Words, when she recounted <HI>Indamo∣ra</HI>'s Indisposition, disturb'd him more than all. Says that Slave, <HI>I will not tell your Highness she feigned, I am not sure of that, but this I am very certain of, she treated the Prelate very different from what you expected; and had I not known to the contrary, I should have believed it</HI> Acmat, <HI>and no other, especially a Reli∣gious Prince.</HI> This, and the Letter he had, and which was found by <HI>Zelida</HI> in the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI>'s Robes, confus'd him; he did not at all suspect the Fidelity of that Slave, however he will have the Opinion of <HI>Mahomet Bassa;</HI> some of the Eunuchs are sent in search of him, whom they return with. <HI>Acmat</HI> bids him be just and free with him, (as he was his Monarch and his Friend) and advise him in what he should believe, and what he ought to do. He then read the Letter, and recounted all to him, and in short re∣ceived his Opinion, <HI>That there was no∣thing
<PB N="167" REF="85"/>in it, and that the Sultana</HI> Homi∣ra <HI>had bribed the Slave to act as she did.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Signior was enclined e∣nough to believe this; but consider∣ing the Grand Visier was the greatest Friend the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> had in <HI>Turky,</HI> he sent him away without re∣solving on any thing.</P>
<P>The Grand Visier was no sooner out of the Seraglio, than that he sends for his Daughter to him, (who was returned to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and had e∣spoused <HI>Amurath.) Mahomet Bassa</HI> commands her to go to the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and give her an account of all, and to advise her to throw her self at the Sultan's Feet, tell of <HI>A∣gustus</HI>'s Love to her, and make a false Confession of her Cruelty, her Reso∣lutions of not returning his Passion, and an Order she must desire from the great <HI>Acmat</HI> for his Banishment, as a Reward for his Presumption. <HI>She must not consider her Love for the Prince</HI> (says the Grand Visier) <HI>any farther than it shall be necessary to save his Life: They
<PB N="168" REF="86"/>must both die, if she does not take that Course I advise her to.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zayda</HI> fail'd not of obeying the Orders of <HI>Mahomet Bassa,</HI> and in short dispos'd the Sultaness <HI>Indamora</HI> to make that Relation to the Emperour. She hastens then to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Apartment, agitated by a thousand Fears; and had not a thousand things diverted her from so horrid a Resolution, she would have Ponyarded him, rather than make a Confession of that nature. How∣ever she comes, casts herself at his Feet, covers her Face with a Vail, sheds a torrent of tears, confesses the Presumption of the Prince <HI>Agustus,</HI> his Writing to her in a manner so arro∣gant, her Grief for losing the Letter before the <HI>Sultan</HI> had seen it, and in a word, her desires of having him Ba∣nished; nothing else, she said, could satisfie her, or atone for his Crimes.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the improbability of this Relation of her Cruelty, (since the Letter <HI>Acmat</HI> had of <HI>Tiridate</HI>'s was writ in a different style) yet the <HI>Sul∣tan,</HI> who loved her tenderly, and all
<PB N="169" REF="86"/>easie as he was to those Impressions, he took her up from the ground, spake such tender things to her, as none but one so much in Love as he could, af∣ter a suspicion of that nature; howe∣ver he lost for some Moments all man∣ner of Reflection, and abandoned him∣self entirely to a great Joy, which was the more sensible since it succeeded such cruel Apprehensions; and whether he wholly believed her or no, yet certain it is he assured her he did: He return'd her the Letter of Prince <HI>Tiridate,</HI> recounted to her all that had been told him, caresses her more than ever, conducted her back to her Apart∣ment, and assured her, <HI>He had not quitted her so soon, but that he was going to put her Orders in execution for the ba∣nishing that ingrateful Prince;</HI> which he immediately did, and caused the oc∣casion of it to be made publick.</P>
<P>The Prince was transported with Despair and Rage at this accident; he came to <HI>Zayda,</HI> threw all the Letters he had received from <HI>Indamora</HI> to her, and desired she would do him that Justice to expose them to the abused
<PB N="170" REF="87"/>Sultan, especially the last he had re∣ceived from her, since their Interview in the Grotto, which he obliged <HI>Zay∣da</HI> to read; it was thus.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>WHat a cruel Storm have we esca∣ped? I cannot counsel you to love me less, but advise you, for both our Safeties, to be more discreet. What a Joy is it to me, to think my dear Prince, who has a Soul the most amorous of all, could be insensible near so charming a Woman as the Sultana</HI> Homira; <HI>she allarm'd my hopes, and gave me nothing but Fears. I laugh now at my Credulity; I did ill to distrust you, (my dearest</HI> Tiridate) <HI>for∣give my weakness, I will not ask you to pitty it: I have too glorious a Destiny to merit so much from you: You know what I require, preserve your Heart and your Love entire for me; I do it for you, and when I see the Sultan near me, I always wish it the Prince</HI> Agustus, <HI>and cease not from incessantly making Vows in your Favour.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>See there, says the Prince, detesting <HI>Indamora</HI>'s Crimes, (and after <HI>Zayda</HI> had read it) see how she deserves to be treated. <HI>Zayda</HI> used her Endea∣vours
<PB N="171" REF="87"/>to calm him, and it was with much difficulty she persuaded him to continue at the Grand Visier's Palace, till she should return from the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> where she was going.</P>
<P>The Interests of <HI>Indamora</HI> were too near hers, to neglect serving her in this point; she came then to the <HI>Sul∣tana</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who was drowned in rage; nothing (she said) but the life of the <HI>Sultan,</HI> should satisfie her: Her Designs of Revenge (she added) were noble, and she would, for once, be greatly cruel. <HI>Zayda</HI> did not much reflect on what she heard, she only minded the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> how much her Friend she was, restor'd her the Letters, and in this served the Prince <HI>Agustus</HI> better than by obeying his Orders; <HI>Indamora</HI> immediately threw 'em to the flames, tenderly Em∣braced <HI>Zayda,</HI> and yielded to go to the Grand Visiers Palace with her, there to see the unfortunate <HI>Agustus;</HI> she hated her self for what she had done, and the Sultan much more for it; she wept to <HI>Tiridate,</HI> calm'd his rage, by as∣suring him, that nothing but to save
<PB N="172" REF="88"/>him from expiring, by the Orders of the unjust <HI>Sultan,</HI> could have made her guilty of such a sin; she assures him she will attone for it by an action worthy her Love, and that she was going to endeavour, by one blow, to attain to her own Liberty, and share his Banishment with him. Mean time, till she should be able to effect what she had promised, he must submit to the Orders that had been given for his Exile; that he should retire him∣self to <HI>Italy,</HI> till she should order his Return. As for her, she said, after her departure from <HI>Turky,</HI> she would go to <HI>Germany,</HI> and to the Emperor's Court, and use all her endeavours for his Return from that Exile, or if she should not be able to effect it, she would however end her Life with him, since nothing but Death was of force enough to extinguish the Passion she had for him. <HI>Agustus</HI> returned this tenderness; and after having given reciprocally their Vows of Loving for ever, they prepared to leave one another, but with so many transports of Sorrow, Grief and Passion, that they were not
<PB N="173" REF="88"/>capable of speaking; and the Prince, who was hurried away by his cruel Destiny, left the <HI>Sultana</HI> swooning in the Arms of <HI>Zayda,</HI> to whom he ren∣der'd a thousand Expressions of Gra∣titude, and left <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Tur∣ky,</HI> with an inconceivable Regret.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sultana</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> (after her Recovery from her Swoon) learnt the Departure of the Prince with a vexatious Sorrow; but she must dry her Tears, and prepare for her Re∣turn to the <HI>Seraglio:</HI> She will be fatal∣ly revenged, but not yet, she has not an opportunity of doing it without Noise; she is constrained (to take off all suspicion) to render her Acknow∣ledgments to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> for banishing <HI>Agustus;</HI> she is also forc'd to dissemble more than ever; she appears gay when she is mortally afflicted, and tender to the Sultan, while she is searching for a way to be reveng'd on him. She be∣comes cruel, and, Oh, Horror! at last resolves on the most barbarous of Mur∣ders; her Resentments have a fatal ter∣mination, and her Rage suggested to her, that nothing but his Death could
<PB N="174" REF="89"/>repair the Injuries he had done her, and render her again happy in her Love; she did not reflect on the Great∣ness of her Crime, (her dear Prelate had Power to absolve her of it,) and those in Love never believe that thing a Sin, which is so highly serviceable to their Passion.</P>
<P>The Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> (mean time,) was full enough of Rage, to see how <HI>Indamora</HI> had prevented her designs, but she has address to pass over her regret, she resolves now no more to endeavour the revenging her self, since she has so continually failed in it, but she will invert all to a design of grati∣fying her tender Inclinations, and that she will care for nothing beyond ma∣king new Conquests; and she does not now seem to be sorry, the Grand Vi∣sier had the last Revenge, since she saw by it his Love for her was not ex∣tinguish'd, and those of a passionate Character, had very seldom an ill Re∣ception from her in the end.</P>
<P>But whil'st she has thus disposed of her self, and that the whole Ottoman Empire enjoy'd a Tranquility beyond
<PB N="175" REF="89"/>all Example, the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> will disturb it; and having got a slow Poyson, she conveys it into a Glass where the Sultan was to drink, he sup∣ped with her that fatal Night, and whil'st he is more admired than ever by all the World, he falls by the ex∣treme malice of a Woman, and a Woman so dear to him; he drank the Poyson, and returned very well to his own Apartment, and does not feel the effects of it 'till the following day, then it was that he was torn with ex∣tremity of Torture, and that all the Court despaired of his Life, but he linguered yet some few days longer; there was none, that durst say, he was poysoned, and if any suspected it, they did not make their opinion publick, it passed for a dreadful Malady, which he had before been afflicted with, and he died (in the opinion of all,) of that Distemper.</P>
<P>During his Sickness, he express'd a tender regret for parting with his dear Sultana, (as he would call her,) but his great Weakness, and the publick Affairs, together with that of his Soul, so em∣ploy'd
<PB N="176" REF="90"/>his hasty time, that he saw the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> but very seldom.</P>
<P>By his Death <HI>Mustapha</HI> was Grand Signior, (a thing never before known in <HI>Turky,</HI>) the Brothers being always Slain, but <HI>Acmat</HI> having no Children, and being one of the best of Princes, preserved him to succeed him; and at his quitting the World, he tenderly required from his Kindness, a Prote∣ction for the Sultana of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mustapha</HI> (now the Sultan,) had not long possess'd the Crowns and Title, then that his Nephew <HI>Osmen</HI> re∣bels against him; but that being not my Business, I must pass it over to come to the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> she mourned strictly for <HI>Acmat,</HI> and was very well pleased, that she was no man∣ner of way suspected (nor, in a word, any else,) for the murdering of him.</P>
<P>After her first mourning, she implo∣red, and received, Permission of <HI>Musta∣pha</HI> to retire from <HI>Turky;</HI> which, in effect, she did, not long after, with those de∣signs which we have already related, in her Orders to the Prince <HI>Tiridate Agustus</HI> at his departure from <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
