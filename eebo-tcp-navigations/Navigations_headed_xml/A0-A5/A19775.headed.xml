<HEAD>THE VIEVV OF FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>AESAR in his Commentaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caesar Com. lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE> deui∣deth the people of Gaule, into <HI>Belgi, Celtae,</HI> and <HI>Aquitani,</HI> parted the one from the other by the two Riuers of <HI>Seine</HI> and <HI>Garond:</HI> the <HI>Aquitani</HI> from the <HI>Celtae</HI> by the <HI>Garond</HI>: the <HI>Belgi</HI> from the <HI>Celtae</HI> by the <HI>Seine,</HI> and these betweene the two Riuers. According to which diuision,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. Commi∣nes.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Philip de Commines</HI> boun∣deth France with two Seas, the Ocean and Mediterra∣nean; with two Mountaynes, the Alpes and Pireneis, and with one Riuer, the Rheine.</P>
<P>If I should follow the direction of these two most approued authorities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Limits.</HI></NOTE> I must be forced to discourse of such Princes, as are interessed in this large compasse, as namely, the <HI>Spanish King,</HI> the <HI>States of the low Countries,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Sauoy</HI> and <HI>Lorraine,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> himselfe, the little City of <HI>Geneua,</HI> and others: but I onely purpose to take a view of that which is directly vnder the Crowne of France at this day, and thereof to giue a superficiall relation.</P>
<P>France then is seated vnder a very temperate and wholesome Clymate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. Commi∣nes.</HI></NOTE> <HI>En tout le monde il n'y a Region mieux situèe que celle de la France, car nous y tenons de region chaude et aussi de la froid</HI>: There is no Countrey in the world better scituate then that of France: for it partici∣pateth of the Clymate both hote and cold. It is in length from <HI>Bologne</HI> to <HI>Marseilles,</HI> two hundred leagues (after the rate of three English miles a league) and in breadth from <HI>Mount S. Bernard,</HI> to <HI>S. Iohn de Luze,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabinet du Roy▪</HI></NOTE> as
<PB REF="3"/>
much; for it is holden by some Authours to be of fi∣gure, quadrate: which notwithstanding <HI>Bodin</HI> deny∣eth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. lib.</HI> 6. <HI>La Noüe.</HI></NOTE> avowing it to be in forme of a Lozenge, with whom <HI>La Noüe</HI> consenteth, measuring it thus: From <HI>Calais</HI> (for now <HI>Calais</HI> is French) to <HI>Narbone,</HI> North and South, is two hundred leagues: from <HI>Rochell</HI> to <HI>Lions,</HI> West and East, is one hundred and twenty leagues: From <HI>Mets</HI> to <HI>Bayonne</HI> Northeast and Southwest, two hundred leagues; and from <HI>Morley</HI> in <HI>Bretagny,</HI> to <HI>Antibe</HI> in <HI>Prouence,</HI> Northwest and Southeast, as much. True it is, that many places within this compasse are holden, but not of the King, as <HI>Auignon,</HI> and what else the Pope hath: <HI>Toul, Verdun,</HI> and <HI>Mets,</HI> of the Empire: <HI>Cambray,</HI> of the house of Austrich, in like case of Protection, as <HI>Constance</HI> in Swisserland, <HI>Vtrich</HI> in the lowe Countries, and <HI>Vienna</HI> in Austria: and as <HI>Lucca</HI> and <HI>Genoüa</HI> in Italy, protected by the King of Spayne. So doe <HI>Lorraine</HI> also and <HI>Sauoy</HI> hold of the Empire. As contrarily, there be places out of this circuit, which not∣withstanding hold of this Crowne in right, and owe him fealty and homage; as the Spanyard for the Coun∣ties of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Artois,</HI> which he hath euer since the time of <HI>Frauncis</HI> the first, denied to render.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pro∣uinces.</HI></NOTE>THe diuers Prouinces of the Countrey are very many: the chiefe are these; <HI>Picardy, Normandy, Ile of France, Beausse, Bretagne, Aniowe, Maine, Poic∣towe, Lymosin, Xantonge, Champaigne, Berry, Sologne, Au∣uergne, Niuernois, Lyonnois, Charrolois, Bourbonois, Daul∣pheine, Prouence, Languedocke, Tourraine, and Burgundy.</HI> All which are particularly set downe in Mappes, as also in the Booke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Guide.</HI></NOTE> called The French Guide, where he
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
vndertaketh to resemble eche Countrie to some other thing, as <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> to a horse shooe; <HI>Picardy,</HI> to a Neats toung; and such like: which are but idle and dispropor∣tioned comparisons, as one may well obserue, that seeth these Countries in the Card.</P>
<P>But the thing of best note in each of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cōmo∣dities.</HI></NOTE> is their singular Commodities and fruits, wherewith they are blessed for the sustenance of the Inhabiter: Insomuch that as they say of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> that it is the Garden of Italy: so may we truly say of France, that it is the Gar∣den of Europe. <HI>Picardy, Normandy</HI> and <HI>Languedocke,</HI> goodly Countries of Corne, as any in Christendome, all the Inland Countries, full of Wine, fruits &amp; graine: in some, great store of wood; in others, of flaxe; in o∣thers, Mines of salt, in others, of Iron: Insomuch as one sayth, <HI>Toutes choses necessaires à la vie humaine y regor∣gent en telle abondance, que seulement du bled, du vin, du sel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Noüe.</HI></NOTE> <HI>et du pastel, qui se transporte es païs estrangers, il y entre en contr'eschange annuellement, plus de douze millions de liures</HI>: All things necessary for mans life ouerflow there in such abundance, that in counterchange only of the Corne, Wine, Salt &amp; Woad, transported into forreine Coun∣tries, there is yeerely brought into France twelue hun∣dred thousand pounds sterling. And another no lesse approued, and as well practised in the State of France, sayth, <HI>Les sources du sel, du vin, et du bled, sont inespuisables:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bod. li.</HI> 6.</NOTE> The Springs of Salt, Wine and Corne, are not to bee drawne dry. In which place, he complayneth, that the Kings of France were wont in times past to helpe their neede with sales of Wood, which are now of late yeeres so spoyled, as France shall shortly be forced to haue their lard frō other coūtries, as also wood to build
<PB REF="4"/>
and burne: a complaynt which I haue often heard in England. Other Prouinces haue also their especiall Commodities, wherein they excell their neighbours: as in <HI>Lymosin,</HI> the best Beeues; about <HI>Orleans,</HI> the best Wines; in <HI>Auuergne,</HI> the best Swyne; in <HI>Berry,</HI> the best Muttons, where there is such store, as thereof they haue a Prouerbe, when they would taxe a fellow for his no∣table lying, that tells of a greater number then the truth, they say, <HI>Il n'y a tant de Moutons en Berry</HI>: As one would say, Fye, there be not so many sheepe in Berry. They partake with vs also in sea commodities:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bod. con∣tra Mala∣test.</HI></NOTE> as vpon the coast of <HI>Picardy,</HI> where the shore is sandy, they haue store of flat fish: vpon the coast of <HI>Normandy</HI> &amp; <HI>Guyen,</HI> where it is rocky, fish of the Rocke (as the French call them) and vpon the coast of <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> where it is mud∣dy, store of round fish, as Lamprey, Conger, Haddock; so likewise in diuers seasons, diuers other sorts, as Mac∣kerels in the end of the Spring, and <HI>Maquerelles</HI> (Bawds) at all times, Herrings in the beginning of Autumne, as we haue in England, &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bod. con∣tra Mal.</HI></NOTE><HI>Bodin</HI> will needs take vpon him, being no more per∣tinent to his matter, then it is heere, to shew the reason why in old time among the most delicate &amp; toothsome Trencher-men of the ancient Romanes, they alwayes feasted with Fish: because (sayth hee) it is neyther so mezzeld as Porke; nor scabd as Mutton; nor ranke as Goat; nor dropsy as Lambe; nor impostumate as Beefe; nor subiect to the falling sicknesse, as Quayles and Tur∣ky-Cocks; nor to inflammations, as Capons; nor to lice as Pigeons: and yet the friand French-man, as well as we, neuer eats it, but on <HI>maigre dayes</HI> (fasting dayes) and then also by compulsion of the Lawes. But by his
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
leaue, I suppose, they in old time did it vpon a vaine∣glorious prodigalitie, not for any licorousnes; for <HI>Sar∣danapalus</HI> neuer made his great banquets of Fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iustin.</HI></NOTE> but when he was farthest from Sea: and <HI>Aesope</HI> the Tra∣gicke, that spent 15000. crownes at a feast, bestowed it all in birdes tongues, as of Linnets, Nightingales, and such others as had beene taught to sing, that the price might be the greater. Giue me for all this the good old Bishop of <HI>Toledo</HI> his Capon, who vpon a fasting day would needs make the companie at table beleeue, that by the force of certaine wordes of consecration, he had transsubstantiate this fat Fowle into fish, and that there onely remained the outward forme,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poggio.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Poggio</HI> the Flo∣rentine reports of him.</P>
<P>This Country must needs be wel stored with fish; for besides the benefit of the sea, the lakes and ponds be∣longing only to the Clergie, which at the most haue but one third of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabinet du Roy.</HI></NOTE> are reported to be 135. thou∣sand.</P>
<P>The riuers also of France are so many,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Boterus Relations.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Boterus</HI> reporteth of the Queene Mother, she should say heere were more then in all Christendome; but we hold her for no good Cosmographer; shee had her other quali∣ties, which shall not be forgotten in their fit place. True it is, that the riuers here are many, and very faire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Riuers.</HI></NOTE> and so fitly seruing one the other, &amp; al the whole, as it seemeth, na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, in the framing of our bodies, did not shew more wonderfull prouidence, in disposing veines and arteries throughout the bodie, for their apt conuey∣ance of the blood and spirit, from the liuer and heart, to each part thereof, then shee hath shewed in the pla∣cing of these waters, for the transporting of all her com∣modities
<PB REF="5"/>
to all her seuerall Prouinces. Of all those, these are the principall; the <HI>Seine,</HI> vpon which standeth the Citie of <HI>Paris, Rouen,</HI> and many other. It hath his head a little aboue <HI>Chatillon</HI> in the northwest of <HI>Lingonois,</HI> and receyueth nine Riuers of name; whereof the <HI>Yonne,</HI> the <HI>Marne,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Oyse</HI> are nauigable, that is, doe carrie boats with sayle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Some,</HI> whereupon standeth the Citie of <HI>Amyens, Abbeuile,</HI> and many other: It hath his head aboue <HI>S. Quentin,</HI> diuideth <HI>Picardie</HI> from <HI>Artois,</HI> and receyueth eight lesser Riuers. The <HI>Loire</HI> hath standing vpon it the Cities of <HI>Orleans, Nantes,</HI> and many other: his head is in <HI>Auuergne,</HI> it parteth the middle of France, his course is almost two hundred Leagues, it recey∣ueth 72. Riuers, whereof the chiefe are <HI>Allier, Cher, Mayne, Creuse, Vienne,</HI> all nauigable. The <HI>Garond,</HI> vp∣on which standeth <HI>Bourdeaux, Thoulouse,</HI> and other Ci∣ties: it hath his head in the <HI>Pyreney</HI> mountaines, it diui∣deth <HI>Languedocke</HI> from <HI>Gascoine,</HI> it receyueth sixteene riuers, whereof <HI>Iarne, Lot, Bayze, Dordonne,</HI> and <HI>Lisle</HI> are chiefest.</P>
<P>And lastly, the <HI>Rhosne,</HI> vpon which standeth the Citie of <HI>Lions, Auignon,</HI> and diuers others: it hath his head in the mountaines <HI>Alpes,</HI> deuideth <HI>Sauoy</HI> from <HI>Lyonnois,</HI> and <HI>Dolpheine</HI> from <HI>Languedocke,</HI> it receyueth thirteene riuers, whereof the <HI>Soane,</HI> the <HI>Doue, Ledra,</HI> and <HI>Durance</HI> are the chiefest.</P>
<P>All the other Riuers carrie their streames into the Ocean, <HI>Some</HI> at <HI>Saint Vallery, Seine</HI> at <HI>Newhauen, Loyre</HI> beneath <HI>Nantes,</HI> and <HI>Garond</HI> at <HI>Blay:</HI> onely the Riuer of <HI>Rhosne</HI> payeth his tribute to the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> at <HI>Arles.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5" MS="y"/>The <HI>Seine</HI> is counted the richest,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Boterus Relations.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Rhosne</HI> the swif∣test, the <HI>Garond</HI> the greatest, the <HI>Loyre</HI> the sweetest, for the difference which <HI>Boterus</HI> makes of them, where he omits the <HI>Garond,</HI> and makes the <HI>Soane</HI> a principall Ri∣uer, is generally reiected.</P>
<P>When we rightly consider the happie fruitfulnesse of this soyle, and the exceeding benefit of these riuers, I know not what wee should say is wanting, vnlesse yee will say, <HI>Animus, qui his vtatur, deest,</HI> wit to vse them:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Terentius.</HI></NOTE> for in deede the French hath these eight and thirtie yeeres abused them with their ciuill and intestine warres. Doe but conceyt in your imagination the faire Townes of Italy heere seated, and in them, the English Nation planted: and in my opinion, ye haue the right Idea of <HI>Platoes</HI> happy State: <HI>O vtinam! O si!</HI></P>
<P>But I must remember one inconuenience and dis∣commodity it hath.</P>
<P>I haue heard some poore Countrey-man say, He loues not to haue his house too neere a Lawyer. It should seeme they bee ill Neighbours; and it may be that <HI>Themistocles</HI> roued at some such matter, when hee caused the Sergeant to cry in publike place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plutarch. in Them.</HI></NOTE> that besides all the good properties which his Farme had, that hee set to sale, <HI>Qu'il auoit bon voisin:</HI> That he had a good neighbour.</P>
<P>This is the mischiefe, that faire France hath a∣bout her so many bad neyghbours, as <HI>Lorraine, Sauoy,</HI> and <HI>Spayne,</HI> of whose good affection to this Countrey, wee may say with the Poet, <HI>Vnum cognoris, omnes noris</HI>: Knowe one, and knowe them all: Neyther of them wish her better then other,
<PB REF="6"/>
as hath well appeared in the late ciuill warres, wherein eche thought to haue had his share, howsoeuer (now) they loue no Grapes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hauēs and Ports. La Guide.</HI></NOTE>The Ports and passages into France, where Custome is payd to the King, were in times past more then they be now: the names of them at this present, are these: In <HI>Picardy, Calais, Bologne,</HI> S. <HI>Vallery.</HI> In <HI>Norman∣dy, Diepe, Le Haure de Grace, Honnefleux, Caen, Cherbrouge.</HI> In <HI>Bretaigne, S. Malo, S. Brieu, Brest, Quimpercorentine, Vannes, Nants.</HI> In <HI>Poictowe, Lusson, les sables d'Olonne.</HI> In <HI>Rochellois, Rochelle.</HI> In <HI>Xantogne, Zoubisse.</HI> In <HI>Guyenne, Bourdeux, Blay, Bayonne.</HI> In <HI>Languedocke, Narbonne, Agde, Beucaire, Maugueil.</HI> In <HI>Prouence, Arles, Marseilles, Fransts.</HI> In <HI>Lionnois, Lions.</HI> In <HI>Burgogne, Ausonne, Lan∣gres.</HI> In <HI>Champagne, Chaumont, Chalons, Trois.</HI> In the Territory <HI>Metzin, Metz, Toul, Verdun.</HI> In all, thirty seuen: Of all these, <HI>Lions</HI> is reputed to be the most ad∣uantageous to the Kings Finances, as being the key for all silks, clothes of gold and siluer, and other marchan∣dise whatsoeuer, which come or goe from <HI>Italy, Swisser∣land,</HI> and all those Southeast Countreyes, into France, which are brought to this Towne by the two faire Ri∣uers of <HI>Rhosne</HI> and <HI>Soan</HI>: the one comming from <HI>Sauoy,</HI> the other from <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and heere meeting: where, by the way, me thinks, I may fitly compare these two Waters, to two great Princes of these two great Countries, comming to be maried at this great City, which within the walles is within ten Toyses as large as Paris. In which allusion, I make the <HI>Rhosne</HI> (which in the French toung is of the masculine gender) the Sa∣uoyard Prince; and the <HI>Soane,</HI> which is likewise in this language, the feminine, the Princesse of Burgundy;
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/>
which conceit is the better warranted, because <HI>le Rhosne</HI> is a very swift and furious Riuer, which well agreeth with the nature and condition of the man; and <HI>la Sona,</HI> a still and sweet water, which rightly symbolizeth with the quality of a woman.</P>
<P>I would our Poet,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spencer.</HI></NOTE> that made a marriage betweene the <HI>Medun</HI> and <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Rochester,</HI> had the handling of this matter; for it becomes a Poeme better then a Rela∣tion.</P>
<P>For profit, next to <HI>Lions,</HI> are <HI>Bourdeaux, Rochell, Mar∣seilles, Nantes</HI> &amp; <HI>Newhauen:</HI> But for capability of ship∣ping, I haue heard that <HI>Brest</HI> excelleth; and for strength, <HI>Calais,</HI> especially as it is now lately fortified by the Spa∣nyard, which was not let long since to bee called,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines cap.</HI> 50.</NOTE> <HI>La plus belle Capitainezie du monde, au moins de la Chrestiente</HI>: The goodlyest gouernment in the world, at least in Christendome.</P>
<P>There are requisite in all Ports, to make them perfit, these foure things:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lipsius.</HI></NOTE> 1. <HI>Magnarum &amp; multarum Nauiū capabilitas.</HI> 2. <HI>Nauibus tutissima statio.</HI> 3. <HI>Ad hostilem vim coercendam habilitas.</HI> 4. <HI>Mercatorum frequentatio:</HI> 1. Roome to receiue many and great Ships. 2. Safe ri∣ding. 3. Facility of repelling forraine force. 4. Con∣course of Marchants. The most of these French Ports haue all foure properties, except onely the last, which in the time of these ciuill broyles, haue discontinued: and except that we will also graunt, that <HI>Calais</HI> fayles in the first.</P>
<P>The Cities in France (if ye will count none Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cities. Bodin. li.</HI> 5</NOTE> but where is a Bishops Sea, are onely one hundred &amp; foure. There be so many Archbishops and Bishops in all, as shall in more fit place be shewed: But after the
<PB REF="7"/>
French rekoning, calling euery <HI>Ville,</HI> a City, which is not eyther a Burgade, or a Village, we shall finde that their number is infinite, and indeed vncertaine, as is also the number of the townes in generall. Some say, there bee one million and seuen hundred thousand: but they are of all wise men reprooued. Others say, sixe hundred thousand; but this is also too great to be true. The <HI>Ca∣binet</HI> rateth them at one hundred thirty two thousand of Parish Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabinet.</HI></NOTE> Hamlets and Villages of all sorts. <HI>Bodin</HI> sayth, there be twenty seuen thousand and foure hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. li.</HI> 6</NOTE> counting only euery City for a Parish: which will very neere agree with that of the <HI>Cabinet</HI>; and there∣fore I embrace it as the truest.</P>
<P>By the reckoning before set downe of two hundred leagues square (which France almost yeeldeth) we must compute, that here is in all forty thousand leagues in square, and in euery league, fiue thousand Arpens of ground, which in all amounteth to two hundred milli∣ons of Arpens: which summe being deuided by the number of the Parishes, sheweth, that one with another, eche Village hath one thousand, fiue hundred and fifteene Arpens, which measure is bigger then our Acre.</P>
<P>Wee may, if wee will, abstract a third, because <HI>Bodin</HI> will not admit France to be square, but as a Lozenge: For in matter of such generality as this, men doe alwayes set downe suppositions, not cer∣taynties.</P>
<P>Of all these Cities and great Townes, I will o∣mit to speake in particular (though a Stranger must very precisely obserue whatsoeuer he sees in his tra∣uayle) affying in <HI>La Noue</HI> his censure, for their ma∣ner
<PB REF="7" MS="y"/>
of Fortification.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Noüe.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sion veut</HI> (sayth hee) <HI>regarder par toute la France, ie cuyde qu'on n'y trouuera, horsmis quel∣ques chasteux, aucune ville qui soit à demy parfaite, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lon les regles des ingenieures</HI>: If a man will looke throughout all France, I thinke that (some Castles excepted) hee shall not finde any Towne halfe perfectly fortifyed, ac∣cording to the rules of Ingeners.</P>
<P>Onely I must adde, that since his time, which is now aboue twenty yeeres, many Townes also haue bettered their maner of fortifying: amongst which, none more (by report) then that of <HI>Rochell</HI>: and lately, that of <HI>Amiens,</HI> of which wee might last yeere, while the Spanyard held it, say (as is sayd of <HI>De∣celea,</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Athens</HI>) which <HI>Alcibiades</HI> counselled the Lacedemonians, to take and fortify, namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plutarch. in Alc.</HI></NOTE> that it did <HI>consumet et mettre a bas la puissance de la France, autant et plus que nulle autre chose:</HI> Con∣sume and bring low the power of France, as much as any thing else whatsoeuer: And that it kept and scowred all the passages from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Rouen,</HI> like that other from <HI>Athens</HI> to <HI>Eleusina.</HI></P>
<P>But as the losse of this Towne wounded the whole body of France, so the regayning of it, was not onely the healing of the hurt receyued (wher∣in it was better then the <HI>Pelias Hasta</HI>) but also the ray∣sing of it to these happy tearmes, wherein it now stands.</P>
<P>This Towne would giue mee good occasion to speake of the last yeeres siege, the Cardinalles comming, and the Cittyes yeelding, with ma∣ny other accidents very memorable and worthy the recounting; wherein I had rather spend an howres
<PB REF="8"/>
time in talking, then any Paper in writing; for that, to pen it, asketh the iudgement of a Soldier, of which ho∣nour I am most vnworthy: Neyther will I also spend time in the discoursing of other Cities, which we haue seene heere in France, as of their situation, building, wealth and fortification, saue onely of <HI>Paris,</HI> because the French say, this is a world, no City.</P>
<P>After that, I will breefly relate of the Castles in France, and of some reasons why it is preiudiciall to the quiet of a State, to haue many of them, except they all belong to the Prince, who ought to haue of them in his frontier places, and Lymitrophes (as they call them) and vpon Cities which are strong to keepe thē in awe, not else; and as that of S. <HI>Katherines,</HI> which you sawe at <HI>Rouen,</HI> now rased: and then I will end the first branch of this Relation, namely, of the Topography of this Countrey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paris.</HI></NOTE>The City of <HI>Paris,</HI> seated in a very fruitful and plea∣sant part of the <HI>Ile of France,</HI> vpon the Riuer of <HI>Sein,</HI> is by the same deuided into three parts: that on the North towards S. <HI>Denis,</HI> is called the <HI>Burge</HI>: that on the South toward the Fauxbourges of S. <HI>Germaines,</HI> is called the <HI>Vniuersity,</HI> and that in the little Ile, which the Riuer there makes, by deuiding it selfe, is called the <HI>Ville.</HI></P>
<P>This part, no doubt, is the most ancient; for saith my Authour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caesar Com. li.</HI> 7.</NOTE> <HI>Lutece est vne ville des Parisiens, assisse en vne Isle de Seine</HI>: Lutecia is a City of the Parisians, seated in an Ile of the Seine. We may distinguish it thus: into <HI>Transequana, Cifequana,</HI> and <HI>Interamnis</HI>: The part beyond the <HI>Seine</HI>: that on this side the <HI>Seine,</HI> and that in the Ile encompast with the Riuer. It is reputed not onely the capitall City of France, but also the grea∣test
<PB REF="8" MS="y"/>
in all <HI>Europe.</HI> It is about the walls, some ten Eng∣lish miles: these are not very thicke, the want whereof is recompenced with the depth of the ditch, and good∣nes of the Rampart, which is thicke and defensible, saue on the South side, which, no doubt, is the weakest part of the Towne, on which side it is reported, that the L. <HI>Willoughby</HI> offred the King in foure dayes to enter, at such time as he besieged it. Wherevnto the King con∣descended not by the counsell of the olde Marshall <HI>Bi∣ron,</HI> who told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M. Biron.</HI></NOTE> It was no policy to take the Bird naked, when he may haue her feathers and all. On the other side, especially towards the East, it is very well fortified with Bulwarke and Ditch, fayre and moderne, <HI>Les Rampars furent faictes es portes</HI> S. <HI>Antoine,</HI> S. <HI>Michel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Antiq. Par.</HI></NOTE> <HI>et</HI> S. <HI>Iaques et ailleurs,</HI> 1544. The Ramparts of the Gates S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> S. <HI>Michel,</HI> and S. <HI>Iames,</HI> and else∣where, were made 1544.</P>
<P>This Bastile of S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> was built (some say) by the English; and indeed it is somewhat like those peeces which they haue built elsewhere in France, as namely, that at <HI>Rouen:</HI> howbeit, I read in <HI>Vigner</HI> his Cronicle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vigner. hist. bib.</HI></NOTE> that it was builded by a Preuost of <HI>Paris,</HI> in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the third of England, at what time our Kings began their first clayme, and had as yet nothing to doe in this City.</P>
<P>Some other monuments I purpose to speake of, with their Founders, by the example of <HI>Plutarch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Peri.</HI></NOTE> who in his discourse of <HI>Athens,</HI> particularizeth in this maner: <HI>Pantheon Hecatompedon,</HI> built by <HI>Ictinus</HI> and <HI>Callicraditas,</HI> the Chappell of <HI>Eleusine,</HI> by <HI>Coraebus</HI>: the <HI>Lanterne,</HI> by <HI>Xenocles:</HI> the <HI>Theater,</HI> or the <HI>Odeon,</HI> by <HI>Pericles</HI>: the Port <HI>Pyraeum,</HI> by <HI>Muesicles,</HI> and the <HI>Pallaedium of Pallas,</HI> by
<PB REF="9"/>
<HI>Phidias.</HI> So in this Towne, the <HI>Chastelet</HI> was built by <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostata: the <HI>Vniuersity</HI> was founded by <HI>Char∣lemagne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haillan. li.</HI> 1.</NOTE> Anno, 800. who also erected those of <HI>Bologna</HI> and <HI>Padoa.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Nostre Dame</HI> (Our Lady) was foun∣ded Anno, 1257. where are these verses following en∣grauen, to shew the greatnesse of it:
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq. Par.</NOTE>Si tu veux sçauoir comme est ample</L>

<P>If you would know the greatnesse of the great Church of our Lady, the roofe thereof is 17. fathom high, it is 24. fathom broad, 65. fathom long, the two Steeples are 34. fathom high aboue the Church, and al founded vpon piles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hostel de la ville</HI> (The Towne-House) was fini∣shed by <HI>Francis</HI> 1. Anno. 1533. with this inscription o∣uer the Gate, S.P.E.P. that is, <HI>Senatui, Populo, Equitibus∣que Parisiensibus piè de se meritis, Franciscus primus Franco∣rum Rex potentissimus, has aedes a fundamentis extruendas mandauit, accurauit, condendisque publicè consiliis et admi∣nistrandae Reip. dicauit, anno vt supra:</HI></P>
<P>For his wel-deseruing Senate, people &amp; Burghers of <HI>Paris, Francis</HI> the 1. most puissant King of France, com∣manded this house to be built from the foundation, and finished it, &amp; dedicated it to the calling of the Common Coūcell, and gouerning the Citie, in the yere aforesaid.</P>
<P><PB REF="9" MS="y"/>This is, as ye would say, the Guild Hall of the towne. The <HI>Hostel Dieu</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> was augmented and finished in 1535. by <HI>Antoine de Prat,</HI> Chancelor in this City, his pourtreict with <HI>Francis</HI> 1. is vpon the dore as ye enter. This is (as we call it at London) the Hospitall. The <HI>Pa∣lai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e de Paris</HI> was built by <HI>Philip le Bel,</HI> 1283. purposing it should haue bin his mansion house; but since, it hath bene disposed into diuers Courts, for the execution of Iustice, iust like <HI>Westminster Hall,</HI> which likewise at first was purposed for the Kings Palace.</P>
<P>Here you haue such a shew of Wares in fashion, but not in worth, as ye haue at the <HI>Exchange.</HI> Heere is a Chappell of the S. <HI>Esprit,</HI> built by S. <HI>Lewes,</HI> 1242. Here are all the seuen Chambers of the Court of Parliament (which was first instituted by <HI>Charles Martel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haillan. lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE> father to King <HI>Pepin, anno</HI> 720.) but of them all, the great Cham∣ber of <HI>Paris</HI> is most magnificently beautified and ador∣ned by <HI>Lewes</HI> the twelfth. At the entry, is a Lion cow∣chant, with his tayle betweene his legges, to signify, that all persons, how high soeuer, are subiect to that Court.</P>
<P>The Chamber also of Comptes, built by this <HI>Lewes,</HI> is a very fayre roome; at the entry whereof are fiue por∣treicts with their Mots. The first is <HI>Temperance,</HI> with a Diall and Spectacle: Her word, <HI>Mihi spreta voluptas</HI>: I despise pleasure. Secondly, <HI>Prudence,</HI> with a looking Glasse, and a Siue: her word, <HI>Consilijs rerum specutor:</HI> I prye into the Counsell of things. <HI>Iustice,</HI> with a Ballance and a sword: her Mot, <HI>Sua cui{que} ministro</HI>: I giue to euery man his owne. <HI>Fortitude,</HI> with a Tower in one arme, and a Serpent in the other:
<PB REF="10"/>
her word, <HI>Me dolor atque metus fugiunt,</HI> Both payne and feare auoyde me. And lastly, <HI>Lewes</HI> the King, with a Scepter in one hand, and holding Iustice by the other, and this written for his word,
<Q><L>Quatuor has Comites foueo, coelestia dona,</L>
<L>Innocuae pacis prospera Sceptra gerens:</L>
<L>My happie Scepter in calme peace doth flourish,</L>
<L>While I these heauen-bred sisters 4. do nourish.</L></Q></P>
<P>To speake particularly of all other the buildings and Courts of this Palace, as the Chamber of the Treasurer, the Table of Marble, the Courtes of Aides, and such like, were to be too tedious.</P>
<P>The buildings of this Citie are of stone, very fayre, high, and vniforme, throughout the towne, onely vpon the Port <HI>N. Dame,</HI> Our Ladies Bridge, which is, as it were, their Cheapeside: their building is of brickbat, all alike notwithstanding; the fayrest Fabricke in the towne (and worthily) is the Kings Castle or Palace of the <HI>Louure</HI> at the west: It is in forme quadrangulare, the south and west quarters are new and Princelike, the o∣ther two very antique and prisonlike. They were puld downe by <HI>Francis.</HI> 1. and begun to be rebuilt, but fini∣shed by <HI>Henry the second,</HI> with this inscription, <HI>Henricus</HI> 2. <HI>Rex Christianissimus, vetustate collapsum aedificium refigere coepit.</HI> The most Christian King <HI>Henry</HI> the 2. began to repaire this time-ruined edifice.</P>
<P>From this Palace, the King is building a Galery, which runnes along the riuer East and West, and his purpose is, it shall passe ouer the towne ditch with an Arch, and so cōtinue to the <HI>Twilleries,</HI> which is at least sixe hūdred paces, and so both these buildings shall bee vnited into one: which, if euer it be done, will bee the greatest and
<PB REF="10" MS="y"/>
goodliest Palace of <HI>Europe</HI>: This Gallery is very curi∣ously wrought with Flowers de luce, curious knots, branches, and such like deuice, cut in stone; and in eue∣ry place this word of the Kings, <HI>Duo protegit vnus.</HI> Which I suppose, implyeth, One God maintaynes the two Kingdomes of France and Nauarre.</P>
<P>The building of the <HI>Twilleries,</HI> begun by the <HI>Q. Mo∣ther</HI> (which is also a stately work) is now in the finishing: for this <HI>Queene Mother</HI> began many things, but fini∣shed none (except mischiefes) witnesse this present house of the <HI>Twilleries,</HI> and that other at S. <HI>Maur</HI> some two leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> whither, ye remember, we went to kisse the young Prince of <HI>Condies</HI> hand, which then tolde vs was morgaged to her <HI>creanciers</HI> (creditors) for 25. thousand Crownes, and now stands vnperfited.</P>
<P>The next house in state, both for the beautie of the building, and deuice in the Gardens, is that of <HI>Monsieur Gondy,</HI> an Italian, whose father came into France with <HI>Katherine de Medices,</HI> and was here by her aduanced. There be other very many and very stately buildings, as that of <HI>Mons. Sansuë, Mons. de Monpensier, de Neuers,</HI> and infinite others, whereof especially towardes the East end this towne is full, in so much as ye may say of the French Noblesse, as is elsewhere said of the <HI>Agrigen∣tines, They build, as if they should liue euer, and feede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI></NOTE> <HI>as if they should dye to morrow.</HI> But among all these, there is none (sayth this Author) that exceed more then the Lawyers, <HI>Les gens de Iustice (et sur tout les Tresoriers) ont augmente aux seigneurs l' ardeur de bastir:</HI> The Lawyers, and especially the Officers of the Kings money, haue enflamed in the Nobilitie the desire of building.</P>
<P>I haue heard a tale of a President of Parliament,
<PB REF="11"/>
whose friends comming on a time to see him at his new house, began exceedingly to commend it, as in∣deed it deserued, as well for the rarenesse of the work∣manship, as the goodnesse of the Stone, Timber, Marble, and such like. No (quoth he) ye mistake the stuffe whereof it is made: this house is onely built, <HI>de testes des fols:</HI> of fooles heads. I thinke many of our newe buildings in England, are made of the same stuffe.</P>
<P>Ye must note, it is not yet one hundred yeeres since this stately kind of building (or I should rather say, beau∣tifull; for still the most stately is the most ancient) came first in request.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Noüe.</HI></NOTE> <HI>La Noüe</HI> sayth, <HI>Il n'y a gueres plus de soixants ans que l'architecture a este restablié en France et au parauant on se logoit asses grossierement:</HI> It is not much more then threescore yeeres since Architecture was reestablished in France, and before that time, men were housed but homely. Hee there seemes to com∣mend it, as a great grace to his Countrey: Marry, saith he, <HI>Si on co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te aussi combien telles magnificensez ont enuoyé de gens au bissae, on dira que la marchandise est bien chere</HI>: If we reckon withall how many such magnificence hath sent to the we may say, tis very deare marchā∣dize. I am for my part, of Frier <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Antomaure</HI> his mind, who seeing in a great Palace such stately Halls, such goodly Galleries,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rablais</HI></NOTE> such fayre Chambers, such well contriued Offices: and on the other side, the Kit∣chin so leane, the Chimneyes so cold, and the Cellars so dry, <HI>Vn beau Chasteu dit-il a faire de belles promenades, et me c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rez mes dens a ieun a la Napolitaine</HI>: A faire Ca∣stle (said he) to walke faire turnes in, and picke my teeth fasting after the Neapolitane fashion.</P>
<P><PB REF="11" MS="y"/>The Vniuersities, wherein in times past were wont to bee (by report) aboue thirty thousand of all sorts, are now by reason of the warres, reduced to a fourth part, and many of these children, such as our petty schooles in the Countries are furnished withall. The streets both in the City, Vniuersity, and Suburbs, are very faire, straight, and long very many of them; the shops thick, but nothing so full of wares, nor so rich as they of Lon∣don, in comparison whereof, these seeme rather Ped∣lers then otherwise: But for number, I suppose, there be three for two of those.</P>
<P>The Faulxbourges are round about the City, ruined and vtterly desolate, except those of Saynt <HI>Germaynes,</HI> which was very fayrely builded, and was very neere as great as the faire Towne of <HI>Cam∣bridge.</HI></P>
<P>The benefit of this Towne is very great, which it hath by the Riuer, as by which all the Commo∣dities of the Countrey are conueyed: Wherevpon <HI>Monsieur d' Argenton</HI> reports of it, <HI>C'est la ville,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>And he there reports, that for twenty moneths that he was Prisoner, he saw such an infinite company of Boates passe and repasse, as but that he was an eye-witnesse, he would haue thought incredible, which he also after proues by the mayntenance of the three Armies of the three Dukes of <HI>Burgundy, Guyenne,</HI> and <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> which consisted of an hundred thou∣sand men, against the Cittie of <HI>Paris,</HI> wherein

The Sea floweth no neerer this City, then <HI>Pont de Larche,</HI> some 25. leagues off.</P>
<P>Some say, this Towne was builded in the times of <HI>Amasias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Annales de France.</HI></NOTE> King of Iuda, by some reliques of the Tro∣ian warre, and that it was called <HI>Lutece</HI> (a Luto) because the soyle in this place is very fatte, which is of such na∣ture, as ye cannot wel get it out, it doth so staine: where∣of they haue a By-word, <HI>Il gaste comme la fange de Paris:</HI> It stayneth like the durt of Paris. Other say, it was cal∣led <HI>Paris</HI> of (<HI>Parresia</HI>) a Greeke word, which signifieth (saith this Authour) <HI>hardiesse ou ferocite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem.</HI></NOTE> valour or fierce∣nesse, alleadging this verse,

And the Franks called themselues Parrisians, which signifieth valiant. And by this Etymologie would inferre, that the French is a warlike Nation. But he is much mistaken in the word; for it signifieth onely a boldnes or liberty of speach: which whether they better deserue, or to be accounted valiant, you shall see, when I come to speake of the Frenchmans humour and nature in generall. As for
<PB REF="12" MS="y"/>
the nature of the people of this Towne, their Histories taxe it of infinite mutinies and Seditions, matchable to the two most rebellious Townes of Europe, <HI>Liege</HI> and <HI>Gant</HI>; and yet this last is praysed in one thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hail. li.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>Qu à la personne de leur Prince ils ne touchent iamais</HI>: That they neuer harme their Princes Person: Whereof the Bar∣ricades make <HI>Paris</HI> vnworthy.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hail. li.</HI> 3.</NOTE> And <HI>du Haillan</HI> sayth of them, whē they stood fast to <HI>Lewes</HI> the eleuenth against the three Dukes abouenamed: <HI>Iamais les Parrisiens ne tindrent vn bon parti, n'y ne firent rien qui vallut, que ceste fois-la</HI>: The Parrisians neuer held good side, nor neuer shewed any honesty but then onely. But I can reade no such matter in <HI>Commines</HI>; for I well remember, that euen then diuers of the chiefe of the Towne had prac∣tized secretly with the enemy, and were vpon tearmes of concluding, when by the Kings wisdome they were preuented.</P>
<P>The Armes of this City were giuen them, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1190. by <HI>Philip le Bel,</HI> who creating them a Preuost and Escheuins (like Office as our Maior and Aldermen) <HI>Leur donnoit les armoiries, de guelues a vne nauire d'argent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Antiq.

<P>Ye shall heare the French brag, that their City hath bene besieged a hundred times by the enemy, and yet was neuer taken since <HI>Caesars</HI> time. The reason whereof one of their best Writers giues,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. lib.</HI> 5.</NOTE> Because (sayth he) it is very weake, and therefore alwayes compoundeth.</P>
<P>I compare <HI>Paris</HI> with <HI>London,</HI> thus: This is the grea∣ter, the fairer built, and the better scituate: ours is the richer, the more populous, the more ancient: For I
<PB REF="13"/>
hold antiquitie to be a great honour as well to great ci∣ties,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Castles</HI></NOTE> as to great Families. Besides the Cities and Ports of France, well fortified, there be also infinite numbers of Castles and Cittadels (which the people alwaies call, <HI>Nids de Tyrans,</HI> the nests of Tyrants, and the Prince he calles them <HI>Chastivillains.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem. l.</HI> 6.</NOTE>) Of the Castels the number is therefore most great, and as vncertaine, by reason that euery Noble mans house of any age, is built in de∣fensible maner, as you haue diuers times alreadie ob∣serued. An example of one for many hundreds, ye may take that of <HI>Roch-fort</HI> belonging to the <HI>Seigneur de la Tremouuille,</HI> which in these Ciuill wars endured a siege &amp; 5000. Canon shot, &amp; yet was not takē. It is iudged by the wisest, that in great kingdomes, such as France, no places should be fortified but the frontiers: after the ex∣ample of Nature, who armeth the heads and heeles of Beasts, but neuer the Bowels nor middle part. For in∣deede the strength of a Countrey consists not in wal∣led townes, but in the vnited hearts of the people, as <HI>Brutus</HI> proueth in <HI>Liuie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iunius Brutus. Tit. Liuius l.</HI> 1. <HI>Dion. Hal∣licar. l.</HI> 5. <HI>Plaut.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Dionysius Halicarnasseus</HI>: to which purpose the Poet also saith, Where there is con∣cord among citizens, <HI>Pulchrè munitam esse vrbem arbi∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or:</HI> I thinke that Towne excellently fortified. But where discord reigneth, <HI>centuplex murus vrbi non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffi∣cit:</HI> An hundreth fold wall is not sufficient. Where∣of it commeth, that Histories report of the Tartarians, Aethiopians, and Arabians, that they haue no fortified places: and it is sayd of <HI>Preste Iehan</HI> the great king in Affricke, that he hath but one in all his Empire: and we in England, except frontier places, haue none but his Maiesties.</P>
<P>The reasons against them are these: It makes the
<PB REF="13" MS="y"/>
inhabitants cowards:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plutarch. in Licurg</HI></NOTE> and therefore <HI>Licurgus</HI> forbad the walling and fortifying of <HI>Lacedemon.</HI> Secondly, lest the enemy being entred, the Countrey should stay and possesse himselfe, of some of these places, whereas other∣wise, he onely forrageth and harrieth the Countrey, and away againe. Therefore <HI>Iohn Maria della Rouere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Guicci∣ard.</HI> l. 4.</NOTE> Duke of <HI>Vrbin,</HI> rased downe all his Castles (finding him∣selfe too weake to resist his enemie) and retired to <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> assuring himself, that <HI>Duke Valentionis</HI> could not stay there long, where there was no place to be kept: which iudgement of his, the euent well prou'd. For this cause also, they of <HI>Genoa,</HI> after the battell of <HI>Pauia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 5.</NOTE> where the French King was taken prisoner, hauing got the French Garison out of the <HI>Lauterne,</HI> ruined it to the very foun∣dation.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Ti∣moleon.</HI></NOTE> So did they of <HI>Siracuse</HI> cause the Cittadell of <HI>Arradine</HI>; the only refuge of the tyrant <HI>Dionisius.</HI> Lastly, they giue occasions to the possessors, to rebell and v∣surpe, whereof, both all histories, and among these our owne (where, if I be not mistaken, in King <HI>Stephens</HI> time were rased eleuen hundred Castles) and these fortie yeeres troubles in France do testifie.</P>
<P>There be some reasons for the hauing of these fortified places, which I doe not conceiue so good as these, except onely I should graunt them their Capitall Citie to bee fortified, and none else.</P>
<P>For <HI>Bodin</HI> thinkes it great madnesse in a Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 6</NOTE> to suffer his people to haue strong Townes, (e∣specially as here in France, where they will haue no Garison, but of their owne Citizens: the effect whereof was well seene in the losse of <HI>Amiens</HI>) except
<PB REF="14"/>
the King haue therein a Cittadell to bridle them. A∣gainst which, many Cities in this Countrey pretend Priuiledges, as that of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and some haue bought the Cittadell of the King, to the intent to demolish it, as they of <HI>Lions</HI>; such eye-sores they bee heere in France. In such a Countrey as Italy, where there bee diuers Princes, fortified Townes are more needfull, where notwithstanding ye shall note, that no great <HI>Sig∣nore</HI> is euer made Captayne of the Cittadell, nor hath any league with the Gouernour, whome they there call The <HI>Podesta,</HI> and therefore euery yere also these Offices are changed throughout the State of Venice, which at this day, is the most perfect Optimacy in the world; and the rather, because though the State be Aristocra∣ticall, yet the execution of the Gouernment is mixt, Offices being conferred, both vpon the one sort and o∣ther of the Citizens, which makes that perfit har∣mony,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pla. de rep. lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> whereof the diuine Philosopher so much spea∣keth.</P>
<P>You must vnderstand, that heere in France, all In∣habitants of Cities, are lyable to the common charges of the fortification of their City, reparations of brid∣ges, fountaines, highwayes, and such like. And because the richer sort should not leuy the money, and then keepe it to themselues, or employ as the list, they must giue information to the Chaunceller,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hail. li.</HI> 3.</NOTE> of the necessity of the Leuy, and procure Letters Patents for the same, by authority whereof they gather the money, and vse it, yeelding after to the Kings Procureur their ac∣count.</P>
<P>And for their Watch and Ward, it goes by course, as in the Citie of <HI>Embden,</HI> and diuers other in those
<PB REF="14" MS="y"/>
Low Countries. As for Castles, the <HI>Seigneur,</HI> or Cap∣taine may not force Vassall (<HI>faire leguet,</HI> To watch and ward) except in frontier places,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ordon. ch.</HI> 6.</NOTE> vpon forfayting of their estates.</P>
<P>After this generall Suruey of the Countrey it selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Go∣uern∣ment.</HI></NOTE> we must obserue something of the Gouernment, where∣in I will not trouble you, with fetching their first Pede∣gree from beyond the Moone, as many of their Histo∣ries labour, nor by disputing the matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Strabo.</HI></NOTE> whether it bee true or no, that they came from <HI>Troy,</HI> into the Marishes of <HI>Maeotis,</HI> whence, after some small abode, they were chased by the Romane Emperour, into <HI>Bauaria,</HI> and af∣ter into Frankland, in Germany.</P>
<P>It shall suffice, that from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carion.</HI></NOTE> this people came in∣to France, wherein all writers agree: For after the decli∣nation of the Romane Empire, when the <HI>Ostrog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thes</HI> conquered Italy, the <HI>Visig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thes,</HI> Spayne; and the <HI>Van∣dalles</HI> Affricke: then did the <HI>Burgondiens,</HI> and <HI>Franconi∣ens</HI> diuide this Countrey betweene them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. li.</HI> 1 <HI>de l'estat.</HI></NOTE> conquering it vpon the olde niquilines, the <HI>Gaules,</HI> who from <HI>Caesars</HI> time, till then, had not tasted the force of a forrayne power.</P>
<P>The Gouernement was vnder Dukes, till the yeere 420. when as <HI>Pharamond</HI> caused himselfe to be entitu∣led King. In this race it remained till 751. when <HI>Pepin</HI> suppressed his M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Chilpericke</HI> and vsurped. His line la∣sted till 988. when <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> gaue the checke to the succession of <HI>Charlemagnes</HI> line (who was <HI>Pepins</HI> sonne) and inuested himselfe with the Diademe. From him it hath lineally descended by heires males to the house of <HI>Valois,</HI> and for want of issue male in them, is now come to the house of <HI>Burbon.</HI> In this space of time, you must
<PB REF="15"/>
obserue the three ages of France▪ Her child-hood, till <HI>Pepin</HI>: her manhood, till <HI>Capet</HI>: her olde age, till now. For in the first age, the Kings were like children, content to be taught by others in matters of Religion, (as then ye may note, that <HI>Clouis</HI> receiued the faith, and was bapti∣zed) as also in matter of policy, they were content that others should beare the whole sway, and rule them al∣so, such were the <HI>Maieurs de Palais,</HI> whereof <HI>Pepin</HI> was one that vsurped.</P>
<P>In their manhood they did like men, conquer king∣domes, relieue distressed Christians, ouercome Sara∣cenes &amp; Infidels, defend the Church against all assayles, as ye may perceiue by the History of <HI>Charles</HI> the great, and his successors.</P>
<P>And lastly now, in her old age she grew wise, erected Courts for iustice, made lawes and ordinances, to go∣uerne her inhabitants, wherein no Countrey in Europe hath excelled her: for so sayth my Author, <HI>Il n'y a contré au monde ou la iustice soit mieux establit▪</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë</HI></NOTE> <HI>qu'n la nostre▪</HI> There is no Countrey in the world, where Iustice is better established, then ours: which is true (but with this addition of a later writer,) <HI>s'ilny en auoit tant et trop: et s'ils estoient iustement exercez</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. l.</HI> 3.</NOTE> If the Officers thereof were not too too many, &amp; if their places were rightl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> executed.</P>
<P>This was the reason why many wise men of the world did imagine, that this Feuer of the league, which was entred at <HI>Peronne,</HI> some 20. yeres since, against France, would haue shakē the State, from a Monarchy, to an Aristocracy, considering, that in age nothing is more dangerous; and besides, it was now her climacte∣tical yere of Gouernmēt (for this is the 63. King) though
<PB REF="15" MS="y"/>
this be but a curious and ill grounded conceit, as also that other of the pourtreicts of the Kings, in the Palace at <HI>Paris,</HI> where, because all the voyde places be fulfilled, they would needes coniecture, forsooth, or rather con∣clude, that there should be no moe Kings. But this is but an idle dreame, and presupposition: for in the Cathe∣drall Church of <HI>Sienna</HI> in Italy, all the roomes for the <HI>Popes,</HI> are filled vp long ago, euer since the time of <HI>Mar∣tin</HI> the 5. and yet notwithstanding, that Sea of <HI>Rome</HI> stil hath a <HI>Pope.</HI> But <HI>Du Haillan</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. l.</HI> 1.</NOTE> that as vertue was the cause that this State rose frō the ground of her base be∣ginning, to this height; so Fortune hath beene the cause that she is not falne frō that high pitch, to her first low∣nesse: For he can see no reason of her standing, conside∣ring these ciuill warres, the difference of Religion, the ambition of houses, the conspiracies and reuoltes of the people, the true causes of falling: Therefore hee con∣cludes, <HI>La bonne Fortune nous a plus serui,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> <HI>que nostre ver∣tu:</HI> Good fortune hath helped vs, more then our owne vertue. But without so much talking of the good <HI>Geni∣us</HI> and <HI>bon-heur,</HI> good hap of France, hee should haue as∣scribed the first cause to God, and the next to her Maie∣stie: but this French is euer a thankelesse peo∣ple.</P>
<P>I must not force this Relation with many notes, of things here happening in former ages; it is both imper∣tinent, and tedious, onely I would wish you note, that in 482. the Christian Faith was here receiued, and in the yeere 800. the Romane Empire hither transla∣ted.</P>
<P>Concerning the Countrey of France, the State is a Monarchy, the gouernement is mixt: for the authority
<PB REF="16"/>
of <HI>Maieurs, Escheuins, Consuls, Iureurs, &amp;c.</HI> is Democra∣ticall: the Paires, the Counsels, the Parliaments, the Chambers of Counts, the Generalities, &amp;c. are Ari∣stocraticall. The calling of assemblies, giuing of Offi∣ces, sending Embassages, concluding of Treaties, par∣doning of offences, ennobling of Families, legitima∣tion of bastards, coyning of moneys, and diuers other, to the number of 24. are meerely Regall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haillan. lib.</HI> 3.</NOTE> called of the French, <HI>Droicts Royaux.</HI></P>
<P>And sure it is, that no Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> is a more per∣fect Monarch then he: for besides all these priuiledges named, as we say of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> that it hath the prerogatiue to bee appealed vnto, from all other Courts, which they call the (<HI>Dernier ressort,</HI> the last ap∣peale) so is it likewise true, that the King himselfe hath the meere and absolute authoritie ouer this. For though no Edict or Proclamation, no Warre or Peace which he makes, bee good, without the consent and <HI>Arrest</HI> as (they call it) of this Court: Yet true it is, that when he, sending to them for their confirmation and ratifying thereof, if at first they refuse, &amp; send <HI>Deleguez,</HI> Deputies, to his Maiestie to informe him of their reasons, and humble sute to reuoke the same, he returnes them vpon paine of his displeasure and depriuation of their Offices, to confirme it. <HI>Sic volo sic iubeo,</HI> Such is my pleasure, and absolute commandement.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lawes.</HI></NOTE>As touching the <HI>Lawes</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> we must know, that most of thē are grounded on the Ciuil Law of the Em∣peror: but so, as this State euer protesteth against thē, so far as they be good and equall: insomuch as in former times it was ordeined,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haillan. lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> that he which alledged any Law of <HI>Iustinian,</HI> should lose his head.

force, some are fundamentall, as they call them, and im∣mortall, such as, nor King, nor assembly can abrogate: others are temporall, <HI>Quemadmodum ex his legibus, quae non in tempus sed perpetuae vtilitatis causa in aeternum latae sunt, nullam abrogari fateor, nisi quam aut vsus coarguit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plato lib.</HI> 4 <HI>de leg.</HI></NOTE> <HI>aut st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus aliquis reip. inutilem facit: Sic quas tempora aliqua <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>siderant leges, mortales (vt ita dicam) &amp; ipsis temporibus mutabiles esse video</HI>: I confesse, none of those Lawes which are not <HI>Temporary,</HI> but established as eternall for the vniuersall good, are euer abrogated (such onely ex∣cepted as either vse findes hurtfull, or some state of the Commonwealth makes vnprofitable) so I see, that those Lawes that are applied to particular times &amp; occasions, are mortall (as I may call them) and change times with change. And therefore one saith, <HI>Quae in pace latae sunt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">L.

<P>Of the first sort I will onely remember you of two examples: the Law Salique, and that of Appennages. As for the first, they would needes make the world be∣leeue that it is of great antiquitie, wherewith they very wrongfully tromped the heires of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, of their enioying this Crowne of <HI>France,</HI> which to them is rightly descended by his Mother, and whose claime is still good, were the English sword well whetted to cut the Labels of this Law. Of which <HI>Haillan</HI> himselfe con∣fesseth, that before the time of <HI>Philip le Long,</HI> 1321.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haillan. lib</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>Iamais auparauant on n'en auoit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y parler, la faisant (en ce
<PB REF="17"/>
temps la) approuuer partous les Seigneurs du royaume, les <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns par promesser, les autres par force et par menaces</HI>: The Law Salique was neuer heard tell of before this Kings time, who caused it to bee ratified by all the Nobles of his Kingdome, some by faire promises, and others by force and threates. Hereupon they haue their prouerbe, <HI>Le royaume de France ne peut tomber de Lance en quenouille.</HI> The Kingdome of France cannot fall from the Lance to the Distaffe.</P>
<P>Some say, it is called Salique, of the <HI>Saliens,</HI> a people anciently inhabiting about the Ryuer of <HI>Rhein</HI>: but the likelyest is, that it comes of the two words, wherwith i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> begins (<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aliqua</HI>) and which are often repeated there∣in, as in many of our processes vpon some word there∣in vsed they take their names, as a <HI>Scire facias, a Nisi prius, a Latitat.</HI></P>
<P>Touching that of Appennages, which is also a Law of great consequent for the Crowne (for by this th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Domayne cannot bee aliened, and by the other, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crowne cannot fall into the hands of strangers.) You must note, that this Law imports, that the yōger sonnes of the King cannot haue partage with the Elder, which till the time of <HI>Charelemagne</HI> (when this was made) they might,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ch. m. ord.</HI></NOTE> they must onely haue <HI>Appennage sans propri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te.</HI> By which Charter of Appennage is giuen all pro∣fits arising of the said <HI>Apannes,</HI> as Domaine, the hun∣dreth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. li.</HI> 3</NOTE> rents, rights of <HI>Seigneurie, parties casuelles, lots, sales, hommages, right of vassallage,</HI> Forrests, ponds, ry∣uers, iurisdictions, patronages of Churches, prouisions, and nomination of Chappels, goods of Main-mort, fifts of Lands sold, and all other profites and commodities whatsoeuer, to returne to the Crowne, for want of
<PB REF="17" MS="y"/>
heire male: But the leuying of taxes and aydes, the minting of money, and all other things of regality re∣serued. Some are so curious to deriue this word from the Greekes, of <HI>Apan, totum,</HI> and <HI>Agnon, sanctum</HI>: Be∣cause, forsooth, the French returning from the holy Land by Greece, saw there the like course vsed, which they brought home with them. Others say, it comes of <HI>Pain,</HI> bread, because it was for their sustenance: much like the Lawe of the olde Romanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Nu. Pom.</HI></NOTE> for the mainte∣nance of their daughters, to whome they allowed a yeerely pension out of their lands. But others say, it is deriued from the Almaigne word (<HI>Abannage</HI>) which signifies a portion excluded from the rest, that, because they haue this particular allowance, they can make no claime to any other of the Princes states. This Ap∣pennage hath often beene so great, as it hath bred ma∣ny inconueniences; as that of the Duchie of <HI>Burgondie,</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, to his brother <HI>Philip,</HI> which did of∣ten after, much preiudice the Crowne of <HI>France.</HI> And that of the Duchie of <HI>Normandie,</HI> by <HI>Lewes</HI> the eleuenth, to his brother, which was after changed for <HI>Guyenne,</HI> and that againe for <HI>Champagne,</HI> and againe at last for <HI>Ber∣ry,</HI> whereabout were great troubles, for many yeeres in <HI>France,</HI> as by the Historie appeares.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines</HI></NOTE> Oftentimes also the yonger brothers are content to take yeerely pensi∣ons, and quite their said Duchies or Counties holden in Appennage.</P>
<P>Concerning the other sort of Lawes, in this Realme they are infinite, which argueth (<HI>a consequente</HI>) that they be ill kept: for <HI>gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas</HI>: and (<HI>ab Antecedente</HI>) that the people of this Countrey haue beene ill enclined: for <HI>euill maners cause good lawes.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="18"/>These French lawes are too full of preambles, pro∣cesses, interims, and prouisoes, as by all their ordinan∣ces &amp; edicts appeareth, <HI>Nihil mihi frigidius videtur, quam lex cum prologo:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sen. Epist.</HI></NOTE> <HI>iubeat lex, non suadeat</HI>: There is nothing (me thinks) colder, then a Law with a Prologue. Let a Lawe commaund, and not perswade. Of all these Lawes I will onely name you this one, <HI>Que la minorite du Roy soit assisteé d' vn Conceit esleu par les Estats de France, auquel les Princes du sang doiuent tenir le premier lieu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dern. troub.</HI></NOTE> <HI>et les estrangers esolus</HI>: That the minoritie of the King shal be assisted with a Councel, chosen by the States of France, wherein the Princes of the blood ought to holde the first place, and strangers to be excluded: which was en∣acted at <HI>Toures,</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> 8. anno. 1484. I tell you of this, as of the true source and spring of all these late ciuil warres, because the Cadets of Lorraine by insinuation with the young Kings, <HI>Frances</HI> the second, and <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, vnder the fauour of the <HI>Q. Mother,</HI> tooke vpon them to manage all publike matters at their owne pleasure, and thrust out the first Princes of the bloud of the house of <HI>Burbon.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Nauarre</HI> and <HI>Condie,</HI> the Princes of this family, assisted by many of the Frēch Noblesse, embarqued themselues in the action of refor∣ming such an abuse, and displacing the <HI>Guysard</HI> out of this authoritie, tooke it vpon themselues, to whome it rightly belonged.</P>
<P>Of these ciuill broyles, I meane by way of digression somewhat to speake,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A digres∣sion to the Ciuill Warres. Der. troub.</HI></NOTE> to giue you better taste thereof, as also to see in what miserable tearmes, this present King found the State, of whome, by order of this relation, I am next to remember: <HI>La France a souffert s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt guerres, et a veusix edicts de pacification, en leursguerres ciuiles</HI>: France,
<PB REF="18" MS="y"/>
in these ciuill broyles, hath suffred seuen warres, and seene sixe Edicts of Pacification. The first was in sixty three, at <HI>Paris</HI>: the second, in sixty seuen, at <HI>Longemeau</HI>: the third in seuenty, at <HI>Paris</HI>: the fourth in seuenty sixe, at <HI>Ienuile</HI> (when first began the League at <HI>Peronne</HI>:) the fift, at <HI>Poicters</HI> in seuenty seuen: the sixt in eighty one. Not one of these Proclamations which was not brokē, &amp; new flames of warre kindled; the imputation where∣of, the French Writers lay most vpon the <HI>Q. Mother</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill.</HI> 1.</NOTE> by whom she is compared to <HI>Fredegunde</HI> &amp; <HI>Brunhalt,</HI> two damnable Queenes of France, and the Firebrands of their time.</P>
<P>She came from the Family of the <HI>Medices</HI> in <HI>Florence,</HI> in which City ye may note, that in three seuerall yeres (but not much distant) were borne three seuerall Mon∣sters: <HI>Alexander Medices,</HI> that spoyled <HI>Florence</HI> of her liberty, the fairest City in Italy: This woman, that ru∣ined France, the fairest Kingdome of Europe: And <HI>Machiauell,</HI> that poysoned Europe, the fayrest part of the world.</P>
<P>She bare too great loue to her old friends of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and too little to her young sonnes of <HI>Valois:</HI> her hate was too hote to the reformed Religiō, and her care too cold to reforme the State: She had too much wit for a woman, and too little honesty for a Queene: for where one is without the other, a little is too much.</P>
<P>Next her, are charged, the <HI>Cadets</HI> of Lorraine, in three ages, the Grandfather, the father &amp; child, and al of their houses: for he that will rightly compare the times, shall find,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines</HI></NOTE> that the drift of the Count S. <HI>Paul</HI> in <HI>Lewes</HI> the 11. time, was al one with this of the <HI>Guises</HI> in these late trou∣bles; namely, for that the warres only maintayned them
<PB REF="19"/>
in their greatnesse, and forced the King to stand in need of them, whereas the peace might be much preiudiciall to them, and bring them to their accounts, for many matters ill carried in their charges. Hereupon the <HI>Count</HI> set on his King, to enbarke himselfe in a warre, against so great an enemy, as the Duke of <HI>Burgogne</HI>: and these euen forced their Master, to war vpon his owne Subiects, a∣gainst so good a cause as true Religion. And as he desired nothing lesse, then that the Duke should condescend to his Maiestie, and so make a peace: so did these only wish, that they of the Religion might still stand stiffe in their profession. Likely also it is, that at the first, they did not so much as dreame of obtayning the Crowne, as hauing foure Princes, of the house of <HI>Valois,</HI> al yong, besides the house of <HI>Burbon,</HI> standing in their way: But when these, one after another, died, and the times grew so fauoura∣ble, through their popular carriage (the onely signe of an ambitious mind) as that all the eyes of France were bent vpō them, then they raysed their thoughts, as high, as the highest place, and the rather, because the Religi∣on of the next Prince of the bloud (who should bee ser∣ued before them) was so contrary to the general liking of the French State. Their only cause, they said, was Re∣ligion:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill.</HI> 1.</NOTE> but true it is, that <HI>Haillan</HI> saith, that Religion is only the cloke and pretext, <HI>selon les esprits des païs, ou selon les menees et practiques des grands, qui donnent cette opinion aux peuples</HI>: According to the humors of the country, or the driftes and practises of the <HI>Grandies,</HI> who possesse the people with that opinion.</P>
<P>And in another place, <HI>Diuisions sont comme fata∣les à la France, et entre les causes qui l' ont trouble toutes les fois qu'il à este la diuision de grands, a este la premiere et la
<PB REF="19" MS="y"/>
principale et tousiours couuerte du nom du bien publique, et de la Religion</HI>: Diuisions haue beene (as it were) fatall to France, and of all the causes of her trouble at any time, the diuision among the <HI>Grandies</HI> hath euer beene the first and principall, and alwayes cloaked with the name of the publike good and Religion.</P>
<P>The onely patterne and Mirrour, whome the last Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> folowed in these his dangerous deseignes for the obtaining of the Crowne, was <HI>Pepin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Annal. Fran.</HI></NOTE> who to de∣pose his Master, and to preferre himselfe, found no way more compendious, then to professe himselfe the Pro∣tectour of the Church, and Rooter out of heresies. For which good seruice, the <HI>Romish Church</HI> inuested him with the Crowne of <HI>France,</HI> and hee gaue them many Territories in <HI>Italy</HI>; both, large caruers of that which was not their owne. But the vsurpation was most vn∣iust, as also the attempt it selfe, howsoeuer they shadow it with the colour of Religion.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Cori.</HI></NOTE> For <HI>Nulla iusta causa vi∣deri potest, contra Remp. arma capiendi</HI>: No cause of taking armes against the State can seeme truely iust.</P>
<P>It is a pitifull spectacle, to see a happie State brought to ruine by the diuision of her great ones: but when it is wrought by such of the Nobilitie as are newly infran∣chised, and ennobled with all preferments, who were but lately strangers, it is much more lamentable and also insupportable. The three great States of <HI>England, Spaine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollinshed Turquet Histo. de Spag.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>France,</HI> can instance herein, and giue you examples of <HI>Piers Gauestone, Aluaro de Luna,</HI> and this house of <HI>Lor∣raine.</HI> These are they, of whom all the late writers com∣plaine.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>Les François esloient lois</HI> (speaking of former times) <HI>vrays François, n'auoyent point succéle laict de Lor∣raine, qui donne les humeurs de toutes les sortes de Trahisons</HI>:

The French were then true French, they had not yet sucked the milke of <HI>Lorrayne,</HI> which breedes humors fit for all sorts of treasons.</P>
<P>And as it is sayd of <HI>Lalain</HI> a gallant Gentleman in <HI>Commines</HI> his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Estoit d'une race, dont pens'en est trouue, qui n'ayent esté vaillans, &amp; quasi touts morts en seruant leurs Seigneurs en la guerre:</HI> He was of a race, whereof few can be found that haue not bene valiant, and almost all of them slaine in the warres in their Princes seruice.</P>
<P>So may we say of these, that it hath bin a valiant race, and most of them haue dyed in the warres, but with this difference, that it hath still beene against the good of their Countrey, howsoeuer they couered their trea∣sons with the vaile of <HI>bien publique</HI>: publique good: as one saith of the Duke of Guyenne and Bretagne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem. cap.</HI> 20.</NOTE> <HI>Mais en fin le bien publique estoit conuerti en bien particulier</HI>: But in the end, the publique good was turned to priuate profit.</P>
<P>The chiefest supporter of these Guisards, and that still gaue oyle to the fire of this rebellion, was the King of Spaine, who, (the comparison of the State of France with the game of Primero saith) that he stood by and looked on, following that Machiauellian maxime, or lesson, which he had learned of the other <HI>Philippe</HI> of Macedon, to suffer them to ruyne one another, as did the Cities of Greece, and then himselfe to take the ad∣uantage, and winne all; for it is no question if Guise had wonne the game, but this would haue had the rest. He had this aduantage also, while they were to∣gether by the eares, to be in quiet himselfe: for so saith the principle in the Mathematickes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Du Fay.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ce qui faict mouuoir altruy, est necessairement tousiours en repos</HI>: That which

giues motion to other things, must needes it selfe be in rest.</P>
<P>The third cause I impute (especially of the later troubles) to the timorous nature and pusillanimity of Henry the 3. <HI>Ce qui donne volunté et moyens aux hommes de grands Esprits de conspirer contre leurs princes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>et d' at∣tenter à l' vsurpation de la coronne, est l'imbecillite et la nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tise d'iceux Princes</HI>: That which giues both will and meanes to men of great Spirits, to conspire against their Princes, &amp; attempt the vsurping of their Crowns, is the weakenesse and worthlessenesse of the Princes themselues. For in his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines</HI></NOTE> the Crowne of France was like the daughter and heire of Burgogne: and the poore King, like the crafty Duke, made euery wooer and suter that she had, beleeue that he should speede: the King, for feare lest by these corriuals hee should be brought lower; the Duke, in hope by intertaining them all, to haue their aydes to raise himselfe higher. Marry, neither of them would gladly, while they liued, that this faire daughter should be married.</P>
<P>It is a dangerous thing in a State,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill.</HI> 3.</NOTE> when the King dare not punish the ambitious desseignes of his Sub∣iect: <HI>Voyla le mal-heur d'vn siecle miserable &amp; iniuste, de cognoistre l' iniustice, &amp; ne l'oser dire; n'y en faire la puni∣tion: voila comment les Princes souuent cognoissent le mal &amp; iugeans au contraire, donnent l' absolution, estans à cela con∣traincts par le temps: aux que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s le plus souuent par leur in∣iustice ils donnent cette licence, &amp; apres en reçoyuent les pre∣miers, le mal:</HI> Behold the mischiefe of a miserable and vniust time; to discerne the offence, and not to dare take notice thereof, nor punish it.

<P>This emboldened the <HI>Guise</HI> to driue his King out of <HI>Paris,</HI> whence (they say) to saue his life, he fled in his doublet and hose, and one boote off for haste: so that now was verified the prophesie of Fran. 1.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poet. Fran.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>In this attempt he so farre engaged himselfe, and so irreconcileably incurred the kings hate, as he must ei∣ther be <HI>Roy ou ruyné, Caesar aut nullus, Corona aut Cadauer.</HI> Wherein he was much mistaken, to thinke againe to winne his good opinion, and by this meanes to expect a better houre.

In <HI>Solons</HI> time there were first the <HI>Cilo∣nians</HI> &amp; the <HI>Banditi,</HI> and after one of these was extinct, there arose a diuision of three heads: they of the plaines would haue an Optimacy; they of the mountaines, a Democracy, and they of the seacoast, a mixt State. So in the Duke of <HI>Guises</HI> time, there was a diuision of Catholikes and Protestants: but after his death, the
<PB REF="21" MS="y"/>
monster grew to haue foure heads. The <HI>Royaux</HI>: the <HI>Huguenots</HI>: the <HI>Ligueurs</HI>: the <HI>Confrers du petit Cordon</HI>: these last were a fraternity, who had cōspired to bring in the Spaniard, their chiefe head were the <HI>Seize</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> (A Councell of 16. the most seditious Burgers of the Towne) who strangled M. <HI>Brisson</HI> a President of the Parliament, the rarest man of his time, and two other Lawyers, the one an Aduocate, the other a Procuror: of these the Duke <HI>de Mayenne</HI> hanged foure for their labour. Ech of these had diuerse driftes: The <HI>Royaux</HI> were for the King, and then for the extirpation of the Religion. The <HI>Huguenots</HI> were likewise for the King, and then for the libertie of their conscience. The <HI>Leaguers,</HI> for the ruine of the King, and house of <HI>Burbon,</HI> and then for the reducing of the land to an Aristocracy, which they meant to share among themselues: The <HI>Confrerie</HI> were against the King, for his title; against the Protestants, for their Religion; against the <HI>Leaguers,</HI> for their partage: and like Traitours falsly hearted, or Frenchmen truly Spaniolized, complotted only how to bring in their Patron &amp; Benefactor the King of Spaine. See here the many-headed Hidra that rauaged al ouer France.

But such was the necessitie of the times: <HI>Sic fuit in fatis,</HI> So did the Fates ordeine. But these gayners were those that betted by; for the chiefe Gamesters had their heeles blowne vp: the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> stabbed at <HI>Bloies</HI>; the Cardinall strangled in the Castle: the Duke of <HI>Par∣ma,</HI> poysoned at <HI>Arras:</HI> the Duke <HI>Ioyense,</HI> slayne at <HI>Coutras</HI>: the Duke <HI>de Mayenne</HI> ruyned at <HI>Iuery:</HI> the Duke <HI>de Mercaeure,</HI> come in this March, who

Durfé</HI> charged him, that he loued not France, but sought by all meanes possible to disturbe the State thereof: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ush, sir, saith he, you are deceiued, <HI>l' ayme mieux le bien du royaume que vous ne pensez,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines.</HI></NOTE> <HI>car pour vn roy qu'il y a ie y en voudroy si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>: I wish better to the Kingdom then you imagine, for one King that there is nowe, I would there were halfe a dozen. All these, forsooth, a∣greed, that the Common-wealth was sicke and out of temper, &amp; ech one pretended with his Phisicke to cure her. The D. of <HI>Guise,</HI> to ease the paine which was at the hart, ment (as he doth, that giues the best remedy for the tooth-ake, to pull them all out) to strike off the head: To which purpose, at the Barucadoes of <HI>Paris,</HI> hee had the King fast in the Castle of the <HI>Louure,</HI> but yet most vn∣wisely, hauing the bird in the cage, let him flye away.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cardinall,</HI> that should by his calling haue mini∣stred the most gentle and lenitiue kind of Phisicke, and if it had beene possible, haue cured France with good counsell, &amp; prescribing a good diet, ministred nothing, but corrasiues, and bitter pilles of disdaine among the Nobles.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> like a Doctor of good practise, brings with him a whole shop ful of Phisicke, inough to purge all France, hee applieth his receipt of the Low-Countrey Souldiers, to ease her of her malady: but the weake stomacke of this Countrey could not brooke so
<PB REF="23" MS="y"/>
strong an <HI>ingrediens,</HI> and therefore shee vomited them out againe, before they had done the deed. The Duke <HI>Ioyeuse</HI> like a desperate young Doctor, that would get credit in his trade, vpon his first patient, by putting all to the hazard, without vsing any preparatiues, or obserua∣tion of criticke dayes, giues the potion, before <HI>Monsieur Matignon</HI> could come at him, who came with other good phisicke to assist him in this practise: but at that time, they say, that <HI>Mars,</HI> a maleuolent Planet, was retro∣grade in <HI>Aries,</HI> or entring into <HI>Taurus</HI>: and so it should seeme: for one of the King of <HI>Nauarres</HI> troupes, called <HI>Monsr. Taurin</HI> (as they say) gaue him a Pistolade in the head. <HI>Ioyeuse</HI> was not so precipitate, to breake the Im∣postume before it was ripe, but the Duke <HI>de Mayenne</HI> was as much a dreamer to forslow the occasion: for whē his brother <HI>Guise</HI> was stabbed, and all the great Cities reuol∣ted to him (Ioe, then was she sicke at the hart) he should then haue plyed, to haue applyed his medicines: but then had he his Phisicke to seeke: And after, when the party was pretily recouered, &amp; began to refuse Phisick, (hauing a little relished the wholesome diet of good counsell) then comes he in such haste, that hee brake his bottels by the way, and so was a loser by the bargayne.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Monsieur de Mercaeure,</HI> hee playd the good Kitchin Doctor, of whome <HI>Rablais</HI> speaketh,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rabl. l.</HI> 2.</NOTE> who gaue his patient the necke and bones to tyre vpon, and kept the wings himselfe: for he left them all France, tyred and tewed, as bare as a birdes bone, and kept Bre∣taigne, one of the fattest wings of the Countrey, to himselfe, purposing to haue entituled him∣selfe Duke thereof. But these were all pretended Phisi∣cians: the poore King <HI>Henry</HI> the third ment wel indeed,
<PB REF="24"/>
but wanted skill, who found by experience, after hee had slaine the <HI>Guise,</HI> and left the rest of his house (that were then in action) how dangerous a thing it is, in matter of execution to doe it to the halfe, and that in ministring phisicke, a violent potion is not so dange∣rous, as one that is too weake, which onely stirreth the humors, and is not able to expell them. Among so many Phisicians, we must needes haue one woman to looke to the patient: this was the <HI>Queene Mother,</HI> of whom and her Sonne <HI>Charles</HI> 9. that consented to the Massacre of <HI>Paris,</HI> we may say with the Poet:
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vergil. Eglog.</NOTE>Crudelis mater magis an puer improbus ille?</L>
<L>Improbus ille puer, crudelis tu quoque mater:</L></Q>

<L>The cruell Mother, or her wicked Sonne?</L>
<L>A wicked Sonne was he,</L>
<L>A cruell Mother she.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Queene, who, with the two other Queenes, with whom she is before compared, may be called the <HI>Alecto, Tesiphone,</HI> and <HI>Megera,</HI> the three Furies of France, in stead of being a Nurse, and cherisher of her Infants and family, which shee should haue bene by all law of reason, became a Stepdame, as shee was by nature, being an Italian: Who for more (as it is thought) then honest loue to the Guisard Doctors, de∣sired still to haue her people kept lowe and sickely, that they might be aduanced by their practise. These were they that left France in such pitifull taking, vnder a false pretext of reformation of the State; as we might well say of it, as is said of the abandoned French <HI>Con∣stable</HI> in <HI>Lewes</HI> 11. his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines</HI></NOTE> <HI>Il ne sçauoit à quel Saint se vouěr, se tenoit comme pour perdu:</HI> He knew not to what

<P>But leauing <HI>France</HI> for a while, in this grieuous sick∣nesse (till the <HI>Hercules</HI> that now reignes, conquered this monstrous <HI>Hidra,</HI> and like a skilfull <HI>Esculapius,</HI> recouered her of this pestilent feuer) ye may obserue this one <HI>Epi∣phonema</HI> heere necessarily imployed, namely, That <HI>Di∣uision in an Estate, is the most compendious way to her downe∣fall: Discordia res magnae dilabuntur:</HI> By discord great matters melt away to nothing: as hath well appeared by this great State of <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>That diuision was the onely cause, why we not one∣ly lost all we had in France, but also the meanes to re∣couer all which wee ought to haue had: for in those times France her selfe also was miserably distracted, &amp; brought to so lowe an ebbe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines Cap.</HI> 27.</NOTE> as one sayth, <HI>Dieu fit ce bien en ce temps-lae, que les gueres &amp; diuisions d' Angleterre esloyent encores en nature les vns contre les autres</HI>: So may they now thanke God and our late Queene, <HI>The Nurse of Peace, and refuge of the afflicted,</HI> who (as is sayd of the great Earle of <HI>Warwicke,</HI> That he thought it as great an honour to make a King, as to be a King) to cancell with the Speares poynt the forged law of the <HI>Saliens,</HI> tooke not such oportunity, but raysed the afflicted lownesse of the desolate King of <HI>Diepe,</HI> to the peaceable possessi∣on of the great Realme of France.</P>
<P>But it is a thing euer obserued in great States and Kingdomes, that they neuer rise to any greatnesse, except in their rising they meet with many lets, and are sometimes euen brought to such lowe tearmes, as they are thought past all hope; as <HI>Athens,</HI> by the <HI>Persians</HI>; and <HI>Rome</HI> by the <HI>Gaules:</HI> the like is to be said of great Princes; as of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth of Eng∣land,

This office he now executes in his quiet reigne; that other he vsed in time of the ciuill warres, when as alwayes they of the Kings part sent for his aide to the suppression of the Leaguers, though after that done, they cared not for him. So saith <HI>Plutarch</HI> of <HI>The∣mistocles, Les Atheniens n'y honoroyent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plu.

<P>This King then, of whom now by course I am to relate, is about 48. yeeres of age, his stature small, his haire almost all white, or rather grisled, his colour fresh and youthfull, his nature stirring and full of life,
<PB REF="26"/>
like a true French man. One of his owne people de∣scribeth him thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Du Fay.</HI></NOTE> <HI>De son naturel il est si extremement vif et actif qu' à quoy qu'-il s' adonne, il s' y met tout entier ne fai∣sant tamais gueres qu' vne seule chose à la fois.

To ioyne a tedious deliberation with an earnest and pressing affayre, he cannot endure: Hee executes and deliberates both together. But in Coun∣cels that require tract of time, to say the truth, hee hath neede of helpe. He hath an admirable sharpnesse of wit. In affayres of Iustice, of his Reuenues, forrayne Nego∣tiations, Dispatches, and gouernment of the State, hee credites others, and meddles little himselfe.</P>
<P>He sayth there farther, that though by his Phisiogno∣my, his fashion &amp; maner of behauiour, ye would iudge him leger and inconstant, yet is no man more firmely constant then he. He confesseth it were hard for him, not to be sparing, considering the profuse and lauish spoyle that his predecessor made before him: yet to salue the matter, he makes this difference, <HI>That the other gaue much to few, this giues a little to many.</HI> If you remem∣ber when we saw him play at dice, here in <HI>Orleans,</HI> with his Noblesse, he would euer tell his money very precise∣ly, before he gaue it backe againe.</P>
<P><PB REF="26" MS="y"/>I will not spare in this discourse (which is onely for your selfe priuate) to speake the trueth, though of a King: we are here in a Country, where ye daily heare his owne Subiects speake of him more liberally.</P>
<P>And besides, his Maiestie hath generally this com∣mendation, which is very laudable in a Prince, he can endure that any man should tell him the truth, though of himselfe. Which I will interpret to wisedome, though perhaps some will impute it to a facility of na∣ture. Concerning this thriftie vertue then of sparing, we must note that he is a very good mesuager. <HI>Il fait d' argent auec ses dens</HI>: He makes money with his teeth, saith the Frenchman, meaning his sparing of great and superfluous expence at his table. And for his giftes, wee may call him by an <HI>Antiphrasis,</HI> as <HI>Plutarch</HI> sayth they vsed to call <HI>Antigonus</HI> in scorne <HI>(doson)</HI> that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Pau.

<P>For my part, I thinke he giues S. P. Q. R. not <HI>Sena∣tui populo{que} Romano:</HI> that is, to all sorts of people but <HI>Si Peu Que Rien,</HI> so little, as scarse any at all.

Saith he, <HI>M. de la Chastre vous a liguez, qu'il vous desligue</HI>: M. <HI>de la Chastre</HI> hath tide you, let him vntye you. At his being at the siege of <HI>Amiens,</HI> a∣mongst others of the Noblesse, which he summoned to that seruice, he sent also for the <HI>Count Soissons,</HI> a Prince of the bloud, &amp; one of the rarest Gentlemen of France, to whom the King giues (as is said) 5000. Crowns pensiō. The <HI>Count,</HI> at that time discontented, returned the King answere, that he was a poore Gent. &amp; wanted meanes to come to that seruice, as became one of his birth &amp; place, being a Prince of the bloud, &amp; Peere of France: he ther∣fore most humbly craued pardon, and that hee would
<PB REF="28"/>
pray for his Maiesties prosperous successe, which was all he could doe. Well, saith the King, <HI>Dautaut que les prieres ne seruent point sans ieusne, il faut qu' il ieusne de la pension de ses</HI> 5000. <HI>escus:</HI> Seeing prayer is not acceptable without fasting, my couzin shall hereafter fast from his pension of fiue thousand Crownes.</P>
<P>After the death of the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> when almost all France had reuolted from the late King, &amp; like a poore (<HI>Roy d' Iuidot</HI>) as the French prouerbe is, he was chased of them of the League, from all places of France, to <HI>Toures,</HI> and was there, as it were besieged of <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Mayenne</HI>: After that this King present came thither with his small forces, to the distressed Kings suc∣cour, the King of France, whose name was also <HI>Henry,</HI> would needes perswade <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> with those small forces, which they both had, to march out of the Towne, and encounter the Dukes forces, who were double the number. <HI>Sirs</HI> (saith hee) <HI>ne hazardons point vn double Henry contre vn Carolus:</HI> Let vs not play a double Henry, against a Carolus: (that, is a peece of gold, of 14 shillings, and this, a peece of brasse onely of 10. deniers.) For his valour and princelike courage, it is such, to say truly, as neuer any of his Predecessors, Kings of France, were matchable to him, who, for the space of almost thirty yeeres, hath, as one would say, neuer beene vnarmed, without his foote in the stirrop, and his lance in the rest, hath beene himselfe in person, the formost in all perils, and last out of the field: A Prince not long in the resoluing, but once resolued, quicke to performe, and himselfe alwayes, one in the executiō; though perhaps some wil taxe this hazarding of his owne person, as a matter of imputation, and bet∣ter
<PB REF="28" MS="y"/>
befitting a young Prince of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> then a great King of France. For as I read,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Ep.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Epamin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndas</HI> was fined for hauing beene too forward, &amp; seruing without good armour, after a great victory, which he had vpon the <HI>Lacedemonians.</HI></P>
<P>This forwardnesse indeed is most honourable, and prayse worthy in all Nobilitie, and Commaunders whatsoeuer, excepting onely the chiefe. <HI>Iphicrates</HI> an <HI>Athenian</HI> Captayne, sayd, the <HI>Vant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urrers,</HI> resembled the hands, the <HI>Gensdarmes,</HI> the feet, the <HI>Batallion</HI> on foot, the brest, and the <HI>Generall,</HI> the head: which (saith hee) must best be armed, and carefullest bee garded. And therefore, the answere of <HI>Callicratidas</HI> is disliked, who, when it was tolde him, that in the battell hee was ready to giue the enemy, he should haue great care of his own person, for that the Sacrifices had foreshewd some dan∣ger: <HI>Sparte dit il ne depend pas d' vn homme seul: Sparta</HI> depends not vpon one man alone.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut.

<L>Did shrowd him safe, and make him bold.</L></Q></P>
<P>And the lawes of <HI>Greece</HI> punished that Souldier, that threw away his buckler. But I will end this discourse with the answere of <HI>Timotheus,</HI> to <HI>Chares,</HI> a Generall, tal∣king of his many woundes of the body, and hackes in his shield; and I (quoth he) quite contrary, am ashamed of this, that when I besieged <HI>Samos,</HI> I came so neere the walles, that an arrowe from the Towne lighted hard by me: For that <HI>Ie m' estois trop aduance en ieune homme,
<PB REF="29"/>
&amp; hazarde plus temerairement, qu'il ne conuenoit à Chef d'v∣ne si grosse armée:</HI> I went too farre, like a forward yong fellow, and hazzarded my selfe more rashly, then be∣came the Generall of so great an Army. For the chiefe Commaunder is the moity of the whole force.</P>
<P>When one told <HI>Antigonus,</HI> that the enemy had more shipping then he, at the Ile of <HI>Andros: Et moy dit-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l ponz combien de vaisseux conte tu?</HI> I pray you, for how many ships count you me?</P>
<P>If then one Generall be in stead of many ships at sea; and many troopes at land, it behoueth he be carefull to keepe those forces well (that is, him selfe) if he will doe his Countrey good seruice. You must note therefore, that there is no man so great by birth, or Noble, whom it well becommeth not to be as valiant and forward as the best, euen though hee were a King: and indeed the greater hee is, the more his honour is engaged to be valiant; prouided alwayes, that hee bee not the chiefe Commaunder of the Army. As the King of Boheme dyed in the field,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vigner. hib. hist.</HI></NOTE> on the French Kings side, fighting against the English in France, with more honour, then the French King <HI>Francis</HI> the first, at <HI>Pauie</HI> in Italy, where, by his too great forwardnesse, hee was taken Prisoner.</P>
<P>Therefore it is that one saith, <HI>Vn bon &amp; saye Gene∣ral doit mourir de vieilesse</HI>: A good and discreet Ge∣nerall should dye of age.</P>
<P>But to returne to the King. Hee is naturally very af∣fable and familiar, and more (we strangers thinke) then fits the Maiesty of a great King of France. But it is the fashion of this Countrey of France (as <HI>Bodin</HI> sayth) though he seeme much to misse-like it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. li.</HI> 4</NOTE> and preferreth
<PB REF="29" MS="y"/>
the fashion of England, Suedon and Poland, where the Princes haue more Maiesty and reuerence among their subiects: For as <HI>Plutarch</HI> sayth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut.

<P>Whereof you may haue two very fit examples here in France; of <HI>Lewes,</HI> the 11. and <HI>Frances</HI> the 1. without seeking further.</P>
<P>King <HI>Lewes</HI> would haue his sonne <HI>Charles</HI> learne no Latine, forsooth, but onely this sentence, <HI>Qui nescit dis∣simulare, nescit regnare,</HI> He that knowes not how to dis∣semble, knowes not how to raigne. Hereupon all the Court began to despise learning, and to say, that Latine was for a Priest, not for a Gentleman: And that it was learning ynough for a Nobleman, if hee could write his owne name, yea, and I haue heard of an Admirall of France, that could not do that neither.</P>
<P>The second example is, of <HI>Frances</HI> the first, who cut his hayre short, because of a hurt hee had in his head: and presently all the Court and Noblesse fol∣lowed that fashion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bod. li.</HI> 4.</NOTE> cutting (sayth <HI>Bodin</HI>) their long lockes, <HI>qu' estoit l' ancienne marque de beaute, et de la No∣blesse</HI>▪ Which was the ancient badge of beauty, and Nobilitie. Which olde fashion, I doubt not but they had from the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> whose youth were all of them commaunded to weare long locks, because (saith their Law-maker) <HI>Les cheueux renaent ceux qui sont be∣aux encore plus beaux,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut.

<P>The carriage of a Prince, though it bee a naturall de∣fect, and disgraceful, is oftentimes imitated of the Cour∣tiers by affectation. <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> held their heads awry vpon the one shoulder, and both their Courts followed, <HI>Tel Maistre, tel vallet</HI>:

Like Master, like man. You see, in that thing wherein you would most be instructed, I am least able to satisfie you, by reason we haue not seene the Court at all, saue onely two dayes, while it staid here at <HI>Orleans.</HI> Howbeit, out of that which I there saw, which I haue heard of o∣thers, and read in Authors, I will aduenture to relate, concerning the Officers of this Court;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Offi∣cers of Court.</HI></NOTE> for as for other great Offices, as of <HI>Constable, Admirall, Marshal, Grand M.</HI> of the <HI>Eauës</HI> and <HI>Forrests, Grand M.</HI> of the <HI>Artillery,</HI> and others, I shall speake of them, when I come to relate of the Kings Forces ingenerall, to which place these Offices especially appertayne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Grand M<SUP>r</SUP>. of France</HI>: Great Master. <HI>Hail. li.</HI> 3.</NOTE>The first Office then of Court, is that of the <HI>Grand Maistre,</HI> Great Master, which in elder times was called <HI>Comte de Palais,</HI> Earle of the Palace, and after changed into the name of <HI>Grand Seneschal,</HI> and now lastly into <HI>Grand Maistre.</HI> The <HI>Count Soissons,</HI> youngest Son to <HI>Lewes</HI> of <HI>Burbon,</HI> Prince of <HI>Condie,</HI> doth now enioy this place. It was not long since, in the house <HI>Memorency</HI>: but the French King, to fauor the D. of <HI>Guise,</HI> vpon whom he be∣stowed the place, caused the other to quit it. It is his of∣fice, to iudge of matters of difference, betweene other Offices of Court. He had also the charge to giue the word to the Gard, to keepe the keyes of the Kings pri∣uate lodging &amp; to determine in disputes amōg Princes, that followed the Court, for their lodgings. In assēblies he sitteth right before the K. a stayre lower, as you read in the <HI>Dern. Trobl. Grand Boutellier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Der troub. lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> or <HI>Eschançon,</HI> Great Butler or Taster, was in former times, a great Office in the Kings house, they had place in the Courts of Iu∣stice, as Peeres.

<P>The Office of <HI>grand Chambellan,</HI> great Chamberlayn, was long in the house of <HI>Tankeruile</HI>▪ he lay at the Kings feet, when the Queene was not there. His priuiledges are now nothing so many as in times past. Those which were then called <HI>Chambellans,</HI> Chamberlaines, are now <HI>Gentils-hommes de la Chambre,</HI> Gentlemen of the Cham∣ber. The office of <HI>grand Escuier,</HI> great Esquier, is not very ancient, though now it be very Honourable, and is the same that M. of the Horse is in the Court of England: for it is taken out of the Constables office, to whom it properly appertained, &amp; thereof he had his name, <HI>Cone∣stable, quasi Comes stabuli,</HI> Count of the stable. It was first instituted in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> 7. In the K. entrance in∣to the City, he carries the Sword sheathed before him, The cloth of Estate carried ouer the King by the Maior and Sheriffes, belongs to his Fee. No man may be the Kings Spur-maker, <HI>Mareschall,</HI> and such like Officer, but he must haue it of him, as also all other inferiour offices belonging to the stables. He had in times past, the com∣maund ouer stages of Post-horses: but now the Con∣treroller, generall of the sayd Posts, hath it. This Office is now exercised by <HI>Monsieur de Thermes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Maistre d' Hostel</HI>: Master or Ste∣ward of the Kings house.</NOTE> <HI>Seigneur de Bel∣legarde,</HI> a gallant Gentleman, and one of the finest Courtiers of France.

<PB REF="37"/>
For a marke of his authoritie, hee carries a Truncheon tipt at both ends with Siluer and gilt, and marcheth before the Sewer, when the Kings dinner comes to the Table.</P>
<P>No Sergeant can arrest any of the Kings house, with∣out their leaue. They serue quarterly: they were wont to bee but foure, but now I haue heard it credibly said, they bee 80. in name, but all of these doe not execute the Office.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Grand Preuost de France, &amp;c.</HI> Great Prouest of France &amp;c. <HI>Haill. l.</HI> 3. <HI>Grand Faucon∣nier et grand Venneur.</HI> Great Faulco∣ner, and great Hunt. <HI>Gentils hommes de sa gard</HI> Gentle∣men of the Kings Gard.</NOTE> The <HI>Grand Preuost de France et del hostel du Roy,</HI> Great Prouost of France, and of the Kings house, so called, since <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth: for before, hee was called, <HI>Roy des ribauds,</HI> King of the Raskals: His Office is to stickle among the Seruants, Pages, Lacqueis, and <HI>Fil∣les de ioye</HI> (Punkes or pleasant sinners) which follow the Court, and to punish all offences in these people.</P>
<P>I should haue named before these last, as a place more honourable, the Office of <HI>Grand Fauconnier,</HI> and <HI>Grand Venneur,</HI> Great Faulconer, and great Hunt, who haue authoritie ouer all Officers of chase. They of the Kings chamber, are either <HI>Gentils-hommes de la Chambre,</HI> Gentlemen of the Chamber, of whom I spake before, or <HI>Vallets de la Chambre,</HI> Groomes of the Chamber, which are but base Groomes and <HI>Roturiers,</HI> yeomen.</P>

There is also a Gard of <HI>Swisse,</HI> at∣tired in particoloured Cloth, drawne out with Silke,
<PB REF="37" MS="y"/>
after their Countrey fashion: these follow the Court alwayes on foot, the other on horse. Where, by the way yee may obserue, that the reason of the entertaine∣ment of <HI>Scots</HI> in the Kings Gard, is (as one saith) be∣cause they were <HI>Anciens ennemys des Anglois,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comment. de l' Estat.</HI></NOTE> Ancient ene∣mies to the English: and euer since the house of <HI>Aust∣rich</HI> matched with that of <HI>Burgogne,</HI> the King hath had also his Gard of <HI>Swisses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines cap.</HI> 119.</NOTE> <HI>Ennemys hereditaires de la mai∣son d' Austriche,</HI> Hereditarie enemies of the house of Austria.</P>

I will there∣fore proceede to speake of the order of France, which was instituted by <HI>Henrie</HI> the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His or∣der.</HI></NOTE> Anno 1579. and is called, <HI>L'ordre du S.

Whereby yee may note, that none of the Nobilitie of the Religion are of this or∣der, neither was this King himselfe of it, till 94. when being crowned at <HI>Chartres,</HI> he tooke it vpon him.</P>
<P>Among many other statutes of this order, this is one, That none are capable thereof, except he can proue his
<PB REF="38"/>
Nobilitie, by three descents, from the Fathers side. You haue many in France, that are called <HI>Cheualliers des ordres dur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI>: Knights of the Kings orders: that is, both of the order of Saint <HI>Esprit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Saint Michael Antiq. Par.</HI></NOTE> and Saint <HI>Michael</HI> also. The or∣der of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> was instituted by <HI>Lewes</HI> the 11. in the yere 1469. the statutes whereof are comprised in 98. Articles; amongst which this is one, That there should neuer be aboue thirty sixe of the order. But saith <HI>La Nouë,</HI> this Article was so ill obserued, that at one time there haue bin 300. whereof 100. shortly after, by reason of the great charges, and trayne they kept, were forced (as he there saith) <HI>Serrer le colier dans leurs coffres</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë.

<P>You must note▪ that of S. <HI>Michaels</HI> order, there were 2. sortes, <HI>du grand ordre, et du petit</HI>: the great and the small order: Those wore a coller of Massie gold; these onely a Ribbon of silke.

<HI>Garter,</HI> which by the confession of all writers, maintay∣neth still his ancient glory) the order of the Starre, I say, growing too common, and therefore the Princes, and nobler sort, disdayning to weare it, it was bestowed vp∣on the <HI>(Archers du guel)</HI> who still weare it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. l.</HI> 3.</NOTE> the Nobility hauing long since quitted it.

<P>Besides these foure forenamed orders, which haue beene instituted by Kings, I reade also of two others in France, which had their erection by Princes of the bloud, and were onely taken by Knights of their par∣tie.</P>
<P>The order of the <HI>Porc-espic,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Porcespi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> rased by the Duke of <HI>Orle∣ans,</HI> in enuy of the order of his enemy, the Duke of <HI>Bur∣gogne.</HI></P>
<P>The order of the <HI>Croissante,</HI> or Halfe-Moone, by the Duke of <HI>Aniowe,</HI> anno,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Croissan∣te.</HI></NOTE> 1464. with this Mot <HI>(Los)</HI> as who would say, <HI>Los en croissant,</HI> Prayse by encreasing.

His Habillement was a Mantle of Crymo∣sin Veluet, and a white Veluet Cap.</P>
<P>It is not much impertinent, here also to obserue, what orders haue bene erected in other Countries: whereof, the most Noble &amp; renowmed order of S. <HI>George</HI> of Eng∣land, is the chiefest, &amp; therefore first to be remembred.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Saint George.</HI></NOTE></P>

matter to relate. I will end this discourse of Orders of knighthood, with this one obseruation, that is, that in times past, there were (as with vs) Knights, which not∣withstanding, were not of the Order. Of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tillet. re∣cueil.</HI></NOTE> were three sortes, <HI>Cheualliers Bannerets, Cheualliers Bachelers,</HI> and <HI>Cheualliers Escuyers</HI>: Knights Bannerets, Knights Batchelers, and Knights Esquires, or Armor-bearers. The first had twise as much pension as the second, and they twise as much as the third.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Forces.</HI></NOTE> It followeth I speake of his Forces, as well horse as foote, of which this Coun∣trey is very well furnished, and indeede vanteth (and I thinke worthily) to be the best and greatest <HI>Gensdarme∣rie</HI> of any Realme in Christendome: but on the other side, their foote haue no reputation; insomuch as the last yere before <HI>Amyens,</HI> we should heare the <HI>Spaniard</HI> within the Towne, speake ouer the walles to our Eng∣lish Souldiers in their Trenches, after we had saued the Kings Canon, from which the French were shame∣fully beaten by them within sallying out vpon them:</P>
<P><Q>You are tall Souldiers (say they) and we honour you much, not thinking any foote to come neere vs in repu∣tation but you, and therefore, when you of the <HI>English</HI> come downe to the Trenches, wee double our Gard, and looke for blowes: but as for these base and vnwor∣thie <HI>French,</HI> when they come, wee make accompt wee haue nothing to doe that day, but play at Cardes, or sleepe vpon our Rampart. Of both these Forces of horse and foote of France, you are to note this which followeth.</Q></P>
<P>It is reported of the great Turke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paul. Io∣uius.</HI></NOTE> that when hee con∣quereth any Prouince or Countrey, hee diuideth the Lands vpon his horsemen to each his portion, with an
<PB REF="40"/>
exemption of paying either rent, taxe, or tallage what∣soeuer: onely they are bound to serue the <HI>Grand Signore,</HI> (Great Turke) with a proportion of horse at their owne charge, and in their owne person in his warres, except either age or sicknesse hinder, which are the two onely excuses admitted.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin li.</HI> 5</NOTE> These are called his <HI>Timars</HI>: of like nature as are the <HI>Calasyres</HI> of <HI>Egypt.</HI> You shall finde this that <HI>Iouius</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë.</HI></NOTE> confirmed by <HI>La Nouë</HI> speaking of <HI>Greece, Ou</HI> (saith he) <HI>ils tirent leurs meilleurs hommes de guerre sur leurs terres conquises, qu' ils leur departent, à la charge de se tenir en squepage, pour venir seruir au mandement de grand Seigneur:</HI> From whence hee draweth his best men of warre, dwelling vpon the conquered Lands which hee diuideth among them, vpon condition that they shall alwayes be readie to serue at the commandement of the great <HI>Turke.</HI></P>
<P>So did the Kings of <HI>France</HI> in former times bestowe vpon Gentlemen, diuers lands and possessions, freeing them likewise from taxes and aides, vpon condition to haue their personall seruice in time of neede. These lands were called (<HI>Feifs</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill.</HI> 3.</NOTE>) instituted before <HI>Charlemagne</HI> his time, but till then, they were giuen only for life (as at this day are those of the <HI>Turkes</HI>:) but since, they bee he∣reditary. The word <HI>Feif,</HI> hath his Etymologie of (<HI>Foy</HI>) Faith: signifying lands giuen by the King to his Nobi∣litie or men of desert,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ordonn.</HI></NOTE> with <HI>Haulte et basse iustice,</HI> with an acknowledgement of fealtie and homage, and ser∣uice of the King in his warres at their owne charge. Some <HI>Feif</HI> was bound to finde a man at armes: some an Archer, some the third, and some the fourth of a man at armes, according to the quantitie of land hee held. He that had land from the valew of fiue to sixe hundred
<PB REF="40" MS="y"/>
<HI>Liures</HI> rent (that is from fiftie to sixtie pound sterling) was bound to finde,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ord.

But they that had lesse then three or foure hundred, had a lesse proportion of charge. There be foure exceptions where a man is not bound to serue in person: If he bee sicke, if aged, if he beare some Office, if hee keepe some Frontier place or other Castle of the Kings; for in this case hee may send another.</P>

<P>They are bound, vpon forfeiture of their <HI>(Feif)</HI> to serue three moneths within the Land, and fortie dayes without, not counting the dayes of marching. You must obserue, that as the <HI>Seigneurs</HI> holde their (<HI>Feif</HI>) of the King in <HI>Haute iustice,</HI> so other Gentlemen hold of them in <HI>Basse iustice,</HI> vpon charge to follow these <HI>Seig∣neurs</HI> at all times to the warres.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hail. li.</HI> 3.</NOTE> For <HI>Le feif est la chose par l' acceptation de la quelle ceux qui le tiennent sont tenuz du serment de fidelité enuers leurs Seigneurs.</HI> The <HI>Feif</HI> is the thing, by the acceptation whereof, they that hold it, are bound in oath and fidelitie to their Lordes:
<PB REF="41"/>
And therefore are called their <HI>Vassals</HI> of <HI>(Wessos)</HI> the old Gaule word, which signifieth valiant: for to such were the Fiefes giuen. As for (<HI>serfs,</HI> slaues or villaines) these are domestike, and serue vpon baser condition, for wages and victuals. There is also the (Subiect) that is, the poore paisant that laboureth and tilleth the <HI>(fiefs)</HI> and therefore yee shall heare <HI>Monsieur le</HI> Gentleman speake of <HI>ses terres, ses hommes,</HI> and <HI>ses subiects</HI>: His lands, his men, and his Subiects: and yet himselfe is vassall to the Seigneur, that holdes in <HI>haute iustice.</HI> But ye may note, that no word of seruice whatsoeuer in this dis∣course, doth preiudice the libertie naturall of the vas∣sall. The <HI>Subiect,</HI> nor <HI>serf,</HI> villaine, are bound to goe to the warres, but onely the vassall. The mustering and gathering together of these forces, is called the <HI>Ban,</HI> and <HI>Arrier-ban,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Confer. des Ord.</HI></NOTE> of the Alman words <HI>(Here) exercitus:</HI> An armie: and <HI>(ban) conuocatio</HI>: A calling together. This <HI>Ban</HI> and <HI>Arrierban</HI> consisted anciently of twelue, sometimes fifteene thousand <HI>Gensdarmes</HI>: But after the corruption thereof, when the <HI>fiefs</HI> came to be in the hands of vnable and vnwoorthy men, the Kings of <HI>France</HI> were forced of later times, to erect the <HI>Gens∣darmes des ordonnances:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Gens-d'armes</HI></NOTE> The Gens-d'armes, or men at Armes of his Ordinances, in <HI>Charles</HI> 7. time. For ye must consider, that there haue beene foure principall causes of the ouerthrowe of this <HI>Ban</HI> and <HI>Arrierban.</HI> The first was the gifts to the Clergie, who it is reported haue the sixt part of these <HI>fiefs</HI> in their hands, and con∣tribute nothing to the warres: for as one sayeth, <HI>Ils ne veulent rien perdre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. l.</HI> 3</NOTE> <HI>rien payer, rien contribuer pour leur garde, &amp; neantmoins veulent estre gardez:</HI> They will lose nothing, pay nothing, contribute nothing toward
<PB REF="41" MS="y"/>
their garding, &amp; yet notwithstāding they will be garded. The next was the voyages to the <HI>Holy land:</HI> for whē one had made a vow to go thither, to serue against the <HI>Sa∣racens,</HI> &amp; Infidels, he sold his Fief, to furnish him for that purpose. The third was the warres with the English, wherein by force they lost them. The last cause is the sales of them to all sortes of people, without excep∣tion, as to the Lawyer, the Yeoman, and any other vn∣able person whatsoeuer, that will buy them: which till <HI>Ch.</HI> 7. they might not do. Yee see then, how necessary it was, this olde institution being corrupted and quite decayed, to erect a new: which they called <HI>Les gensdar∣mes des ordonnances</HI>: because at their first erection, there were diuers lawes and ordinances made for them to obserue, which who so brake, was surely punished. They were at first only 1500. But after, they were in∣creased to a hundred Companies, and giuen to diuers Princes of the bloud, and Nobles of France, to conduct and commaund, with an honourable pension: In these Companies should be 6000. (for in some there is 100. in others but 50.) howbeit, it is thought, in each com∣pany there wants some, for the benefit of the Officers, and that in truth, there be not aboue foure thousand in all. For the maintenance of this <HI>Gensdarmerie,</HI> there is a taxe yerely leuyed vpon the people throughout all France, called the <HI>Taille.</HI></P>

To which hee might adde three or foure thousand Reysters, &amp; one hundred Ensignes of French foot, and fourty Ensignes of his good confederates, the Swissers, and yet mayntaine his other frontiers sufficiently manned.</P>
<P>So that yee may conclude, that foure thousand men at Armes, well complete, and with a propor∣tion of light Horse and foote answerable, sheweth the whole Flower, Beauty, and force of France.
<PB REF="43"/>
Howsoeuer the Author of the Cabinet confidently a∣uoweth, that there may easily bee mustred, and main∣tayned fourescore and odde thousand horse of one sort and other, that is, Lance and light horse. But I feare mee, we may say of them, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> sayth of the No∣blesse of <HI>Athens,</HI> hauing vsurped vpon the Democratie of that City:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Al∣cib.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ils estoyent que quattre cens, et toutesfois se fai∣soient appeller les cinq mille:</HI> They were indeed but 400. and yet caused themselues to be stiled, The fiue thou∣sand. So I feare me, hee reckoneth after the Athenian rate, ten for one.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabinet du Roy.</HI></NOTE>The Cabinets reason is this: There be in France fif∣tie thousand Gentlemen that are able to beare Armes: for (sayth he) rate this proportion at a Gentlemā in eche league, by the measure of France (where are forty thou∣sand in square) and it wanteth but a fift. Howbeit, sayth hee, in some Countries, ye shall haue thirty or forty, within the compasse of one league, besides their children. Out of these, if the King would, hee might compose a <HI>Gendarmery</HI> of 8000. men at Armes, and 16000. Archers: which bodie of 24000. Gentlemen, would represent in the field 60000. horse. Hee might also haue a <HI>cauallerie Legiere,</HI> of foure or fiue thousand Gentlemen. He might also furnish the <HI>Ban</HI> and <HI>Ari∣erban,</HI> according to the olde fashion, with twelue or fif∣teene thousand Gentlemen. And yet might hee haue besides all this, foure or fiue thousand for the State of his Court, and gouernment of his Prouinces. This is his computation. But you shall see it proued, when wee come to speake of the Nobilitie of France, that it is ex∣ceedingly shortned in number, and decayed in estate, and therefore nothing able to come neere this number.
<PB REF="43" MS="y"/>
As good a consequent it were to say, that because yee haue two or three millions of men in England, able to fight, that therefore our State can bring so many into the field: without considering the prouision of Armes, and all other things necessary. But this Cabinet was made by one of the Religion, that was transported out of him∣selfe, by the heate of his zeale, and hate to the temporall liuings of the Church: Whose proiects and driftes are much like those of the <HI>Supplication of Beggars</HI> (a booke made in King <HI>Henry</HI> the eights dayes) where he frameth in his fancy an <HI>Vtopia</HI> and felicitie, not to be hoped in France, building Castles in the ayre, and concluding, that if it would please the King to aliene the Church temporall liuings, and vnite them to the Domaine, <HI>nihil est dictu facilius:</HI> (a thing easily sayd, but not easily done) that ouer and besides the forces of fourescore thousand horse abouesaid, hee might also maintayne an Infan∣tery of the French Gentlemen of twelue thousand. I∣tem, another of the populare, of forty eight thousand. And lastly, yet another Infantery legionaire of 48. thou∣sand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Supplication</HI> was answered by Sir <HI>Thomas Moore</HI> his booke, called The <HI>Pitifull complaint of the puling soules in Purgatory:</HI> How well I knowe not, but of this I am sure, that if such a number of horse and foote should ei∣ther bee maintayned vpon the Church liuing, or vpon the poore people (vpon whome all these charges of the <HI>Gend'armes</HI> lyeth, here would bee many more puling soules, and pitifull complayntes in France, then are Sir <HI>Thomas Moores</HI> Purgatory.</P>
<P>It then remaines, that we hold our selues to the iudge∣ment of <HI>La Nouë,</HI> afore set downe, who also confesseth,
<PB REF="44"/>
that in <HI>Charles</HI> the sixt his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë.</HI></NOTE> there were in the fielde, twentie two thousand Lances, but since the <HI>Gendar∣merie</HI> was instituted, were neuer but once at <HI>Valenci∣ennes</HI> aboue ten thousand.

<P>There is yet one thing you must note, why the French haue quit their Lances, and serue al with the Pi∣stol, whereof yee shall read somewhat in <HI>La Nouë,</HI> and heare more of others by discourse, but nothing of mee by writing: for I dare not deale, <HI>Vltra crepidam,</HI> in a matter I vnderstand not fully.</P>

<PB REF="47"/>
to the end the people might be the more encouraged, and fight more valiantly: and this they learned of the English. And it is no questiō, but if some of the French Nobilitie would doe so, it would much confirme their foote, by the example of their valour and abiding, and recouer that reputation, which now their foote haue lost in the world. Neither do I thinke this the least rea∣son, why our Ancestors haue wonne so many battelles vpon them, namely, for that wee euer haue had men of Noble houses, to lead &amp; serue on foot with our forces. A notable cause to confirme and assure the vnsteady headinesse of a multitude.</P>
<P>And for the opinion that the world hath of our foot, ye shall obserue what the same writer elsewhere sayth, <HI>Bonnes gens de pied,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI></NOTE> <HI>et meilleurs que leurs voisins, comme nous pourrions auiourd' huy dire les Anglois et les Suisses</HI>: They be good foote, and better then their neighbours, as wee may say now adayes of the English and Swissers.</P>
<P>And in another place, where hee opineth of the ma∣ner of seruice, he sayth: <HI>Mon aduis est, que la souueraine chose du monde es battaille sont les Archers, et la fleurdes Ar∣chers sont les Anglois</HI>: My opinion is, that in battels, Ar∣chers are the weight that turnes the ballance, and of Ar∣chers, the English are the flower: where he likewise dis∣courseth, how daungerous a thing it is to abide a battel, except your foote be much the better: which in my o∣pinion was no little cause why the French King fought not with the Cardinall this last yere 97. before <HI>Amiens,</HI> because the enemies foote were holden in number eighteene thousand (though I hardly thinke they were so many) a number full as great as the French, and the Souldier farre better, they being all French, except some
<PB REF="47" MS="y"/>
three thousand English, and Swissers, and theirs the choyse men of all his Garrisons, &amp; experienced Soldiers in those Low Countries. For true it is, that the Kings <HI>Gensd'armes</HI> were two for one, and holden also much the better men, aswell because there was in a maner all the Nobilitie &amp; Flower of France, as also that they had the aduantage in the maner of weapon, for that the French serueth with the Pistoll, &amp; the Spanyard still holds him to his Lance. But I make no question, that the conside∣ration of the oddes on foote, was not the chiefe cause why we fought not that day: for we had a goodly fayre Field, and playne as might be possible, as also large: a singular aduantage for him which is strongest in horse: So had we the winde and Sunne in our backes, which are holden no small helpes.</P>
<P>But this was the reason: the King thought it no poli∣cy to play all his Rest at once, where he might haue lost more at one game, then hee had got in eight yeeres: hee had no reason, but to make the Card that was now going, a Bridge of Gold (as the Prouerbe is) considering, that by this meanes hee should gayne the Towne of <HI>Amiens,</HI> reassure other Cities that then stoode wauering, and recouer his reputation in the world, which by the losse of that Towne was much disputed.</P>
<P>Of this somewhat hath beene sayde before: I therefore leaue to speake further thereof, as also of the French forces, or seruice in warres, with the onely remembrance of a French mans reason, who thought himselfe no small wise man, that would needes proue that the French seruice, and Souldier also, was bet∣ter then the English: Because (sayth he) wee haue
<PB REF="48"/>
more old Captaynes in France, then you in England. Much like the reason of <HI>Rablais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rablais.</HI></NOTE> who would needes proue, that drunkennesse was better for the body then Phisike, because there were more old drunkards, then old Phisicians.</P>
<P>It now remayneth I speake of his Expence, which chiefly consisteth in these two things before spoken of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Expēce</HI></NOTE> namely, his Court and his Forces: wherein it is very hard to relate an exact proportion, considering not onely the varietie and difference of writers, but also the vncertainty of the numbers of Pensionai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, or pro∣uisioned: And lastly, the change and alteration of their allowance, not continuing alwayes the same. How∣beit, that which is most commonly reported, and see∣meth neerest the truth, is this: The maintenance of fiue Regiments of foote, at sixe Crownes the moneth, commeth to foure hundred sixtie eight thousand Crownes the yere, besides the pension of 5. Collonels, at two thousand Crownes a peece; thirty Captaynes at one thousand pension a man; as many Lieutenants at fiue hundred, and Ensignes at three hundred the peece; which is in all seuenty foure thousand: which added to the first summe, makes the whole charge of these Regi∣ments, yerely to amount to the summe of fiue hundred forty two thousand Crownes. This proportion diffe∣reth not much from that of <HI>Bodin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bod. lib.</HI> 5.</NOTE> where he sayth, The King might maintayne in ordinary twenty thousand foote, at the rate of three millions, and fiue hundred thousand <HI>liures,</HI> which if you reduce to Crownes, and to one number of sixe thousand foote, commeth to a lesse rate then that other, namely, to foure hūdred eight thousand, three hundred thirty three Crownes: but I
<PB REF="48" MS="y"/>
think, that former is neerer the truth. For the allowance of his <HI>Gensd'armes,</HI> which are reckoned at sixe thousand, as is before said (though in truth there be but foure) for he payeth thus many, I follow the proportion of them that say, that 51750. crownes, is the ordinary allowance for one company of a hundred yerely: for where are sixe thousand men at Armes in the field, are eighteene thousand horse in all. After this rate then of the hun∣dred before set downe, the whole <HI>Gensd'armery</HI> amoun∣teth to 3105000. crownes.</P>
<P>For the expence of his Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t du Roy. But I doubt of this Au∣thours report, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> you shall heare it to be thus rated: The Table of the King, and those of the Gentlemen of the Chamber, at 112000. crownes: for his <HI>menus plaisirs,</HI> petty pleasures, a thousand crownes a day in all 165000. (But this was a proportion for the last King, who was a great giuer.) For the <HI>grand</HI> and <HI>petite Escuyrie,</HI> great and little Stable, 190000. For the Constable, 24000. For the <HI>grand Maistre,</HI> great Ma∣ster, 20000. For the Mareshals of France, 18000. a∣peece, when they were but foure; for now it is a Title onely, without either pension or commaund, saue on∣ly in the foure chiefe. For the Admirall, 15000. for the <HI>grand Veneur,</HI> great Hunt, 16000. For the Gouer∣nours of his Prouinces in all, 188000. For the Gentle∣men of his Chamber, their pension 1200. crownes a∣peece, in all sixe hundred thousand. For the Captaines of his Gards, <HI>à cheual,</HI> on Horse, two thousand apeece. For their Lieutenants, eight hundred. For two thou∣sand Swisse of his Gard, ten crownes a month, 24840. For all other domesticall Officers, one hundred thou∣sand. For Heraults, sixe thousand. For Mareshals of lodgings and Fourriers, 4600. For Preuost Marshals
<PB REF="49"/>
of Prouinces, a thousand a peece, in all twentie foure thousand. For twentie foure hundred Archers to at∣tend these Preuosts in the execution of their Office, seuen hundred and twentie thousand Crownes. For his Ambassadours in diuers Countreyes, two hundred and fiftie thousand. For his Officers of Finances, Trea∣surers, Receiuers, Controlers, and such other like Of∣fices through France, an infinite &amp; incredible summe: As also for such numbers of horse and foote as the Ca∣binet setteth downe, besides these <HI>Gensdarmes</HI> and Regi∣ments, which yee heare prouided for, and in the Kings pay.</P>
<P>But yee must obserue, that of all these Court charges and others here beforemencioned (except those of his Forces) yee are not to make any ground as of a trueth: they being onely the supposed charges, set downe by this said Authour, who for his errors in other matters, hath also lost his credit in this.</P>
<P>Howbeit, I thought good to remember them, that yee might thereby haue some vnderstanding of the dif∣ference of those Offices, and how one exceedeth ano∣ther, as well in pension and benefit, as in precedents and honour.</P>
<P>To speake either particularly of the Court expenses, or generally what they be certaine, I cannot, not hauing heard any thing thereof, but onely that it is supposed, the charge of the Kings house, is fiue hundred Crownes a day. But sure it is, that these late Warres haue forced the Crowne of France to be at infinite charge: for yee shall read in <HI>La Nouë,</HI> that aboue twenty yeres since, <HI>Nos roys ont dependu aux guerres ciuiles soinant dix millions d'or.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë.</HI></NOTE> Our Kings haue spent in the ciuill Warres, sixtie milli∣ons
<PB REF="49" MS="y"/>
of Crownes. And it is said that <HI>Monsieur Gobelin, Treasorer d' Espurgne,</HI> Treasorer of the Exchequer, pas∣sed his accompts this last yeere, for twentie one milli∣ons <HI>d' or,</HI> of Crownes: so deare was the recouering of <HI>Amiens</HI>: for no question, there was his greatest expence, (except the pay of Financers wages.)</P>
<P>What then hath bene the expence in these eight and thirtie yeeres space of the Ciuill warres, may easily bee coniectured to be infinit, considering withall the lauish prodigalitie, and immeasureable spending of the Prin∣ces, especially of the last: who some let not to say, that hee left the state engaged by one meanes and other; as namely, the sale of his Aides,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Dets.</HI></NOTE> the alienation of his Do∣maine, and money taken vp to vsurie, not much lesse then two hundred millions of Crownes in debt.</P>
<P>So that wee may say, this King findes France, after <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as <HI>Vespasian</HI> found the Empire after <HI>Nero,</HI> and <HI>Caligula,</HI> whereof the one had giuen away fiue and fiftie millions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 6.</NOTE> and the other had spent sixtie seuen in one yeere. Whereupon he pro∣testeth in open Senate, <HI>Quadringenties millies.</HI> i. 1000. <HI>mill. opus esse vt resp▪ stare possit.</HI> But no maruaile, though the Crowne of France grew farre into debt, conside∣ring that euen before these Ciuill warres, when was no such necessitie of expence, <HI>Henry</HI> the second ought more in 12. yeeres, saith <HI>Bodin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 3.</NOTE> then his predecessors had leuied vpon France in forty yeres before by all meanes.</P>
<P>And the Chancellour auoweth to the Court of Par∣liament, in <HI>Francis</HI> the second his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Com. de l' estat.</HI></NOTE> that the King could not quit his debts, which his Grand-father and Father left him in, in ten yeres: Which debts, <HI>Bodin</HI> in particular proueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 6.</NOTE> to bee about the summe of fortie
<PB REF="50"/>
three millions, which in the same place hee setteth down, namely, 2312610. <HI>De prests gratuits,</HI> (of loanes or priuy Seales, <HI>Dont il ne payoiet point d' interest,</HI> 15926555. for which hee payed interest: and 775979. which he was yet owing in arrerages, of the vsance behinde to be paide. Besides, to the <HI>Duke of Ferrara,</HI> and other debts for marriages, to the summe of 8514592. Besides other debts to particular Marchants, of 1564787. As also the summe of 14961778. for which his Aides, Domaine, and Gabelle of Salt was engaged. And lastly, 3000000. which he ought to the <HI>Hostell de Paris,</HI> to the Chamber or Towne-house of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>But the beginning of all this is imputed to <HI>Francis</HI> the first, who hauing in his Coffers, one million, and seuen hundred thousand Crownes in ready money, would notwithstanding take vp great imprests of mo∣ney at great vsance, to enable himselfe to goe through with his warres in <HI>Italy.</HI> A course very ill taken: and (if we may compare great things with small) much like to a couetous and greedie-minded man, who will venter vpon a purchase of his neighbours land, before he bee well prouided for such a purpose, but taketh vp money to loane, which so eateth into him, as he is at last forced not onely to sell his new purchase, but his ancient in∣heritance also.</P>
<P>For by these great interests, a Prince is brought to one of these two extremities, either vtterly to ouer∣throw his Domaine and Finances, whereof the Kings of <HI>France</HI> are good examples: or else to play Bankrupt and pay no body, as now of late the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath done, with the Marchants of <HI>Genoa, Florence, Ausburghe,</HI> and almost all the Bankes in <HI>Christendome</HI>: insomuch as
<PB REF="50" MS="y"/>
the last yeere, when I was in Italy, ye should heare them say in derision, that the King of Spayne had made more ill faces vpon the Exchange, in one day, then <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> the famous Paynter and Caruer, had euer made good faces in all his life.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> learned this kind of borrowing, of <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, his father, who at one time was indebted fiftie millions, for which his Domaynes, and Reuenues of <HI>Naples,</HI> and <HI>Millaine</HI> were morgaged, and once also in twenty yeres discharged all his debts on this fashion. And surely so they may, and yet the Creditors bee no losers (so vnreasonable is the interest they take) inso∣much, as the King of Spayne payeth thirty, or forty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. li.</HI> 3</NOTE> at the least, in the hundred, for all the money hee hath of the <HI>Genoueses,</HI> before his Souldiers receiue it in the Low Countries.</P>
<P>The French Kings, not being able to crye quittance with their <HI>Creanciers</HI> (Creditors) in like maner, but run∣ning on further, and further, these fortie yeeres, as ha∣uing great troubles, and by consequent great charges, and little or no benefit by their Finances, and ayds (by reason of the former alienation) wherewith to defray thē: It must needes be thought, that now the Crowne of France is infinitely indebted, but whether to the summe of two hundred millions or no (though it be ge∣nerally reported) I dare not say.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur Bretagne,</HI> in <HI>Charles</HI> 9. anno, 1562. in his <HI>Harangue</HI> (Oration) for the third estate at the assembly of Saint <HI>Germaine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Com. de l' estat.</HI></NOTE> after many wayes disputed how to pay that Kings debts, concludes this as the best: The temporall liuings of the Church (sayth hee) are foure millions of rent, yeerely: this sold, would amount to
<PB REF="51"/>
one hundred and twentie millions. Of these, forty eight millions may be put in sure hands, to interest, for the Clergie, which would yeerely yeeld them their foure millions, <HI>à denier douze,</HI> at 8. and one third of eight in the hundred, as commonly they let in France. Then would remaine for the King seuenty two millions: wherewith forty two millions hee might pay his debts, and redeeme his Domaine and Finances morgaged: And with the thirtie that remayne, he might fortifie his frontiers, entertayne his Garrisons, encrease his <HI>Ban</HI> and <HI>Arrierban,</HI> and furnish himselfe with Shipping. If in those dayes, so wise a Counseller, as was any in the land, could not deuise possibly how to pay the Kings debtes, without selling the Church lands, you may imagine it will be a hard matter, to deuise how to discharge them now, that they bee growne fiue times so great, as then they were. For all his Domayne is morgaged, as be∣fore is sayd, or at least the greater part, and (as <HI>La Nouë</HI> sayth) that is engaged for 15. millions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë.</HI></NOTE> which is worth 50.</P>
<P>His rents of his Aydes are also gone: for they are engaged to each Generallity in France, as of <HI>Paris, Rou∣en, Caen, &amp;c.</HI> to the number of one &amp; twenty of them, and each hath his portion therein: which would be too tedious to set downe in particular. His Offices are all sold, and many thousand erected, ouer and besides the ordinarie, and money also made of them. His poore people are already with these ciuill Warres so spoyled, and impouerished, as there is almost nothing to be had.</P>
<P>I see not therefore, but we should say of this King, as the <HI>Recueil de l' estat de France</HI> saith of the Duke of <HI>Sa∣uoy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Recueil.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Quant-à son argent, pour faire bonne chere en sa maison
<PB REF="51" MS="y"/>
il y en a assez, mais pour faire me si grande guerre, non</HI>: As touching his money, hee hath enough to make good chea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at home, but not to maintayne so great a warre. So hee, to make merry with his friends, in this merry time of peace, hath money enough: <HI>mais pour payer vne si grande summe, non:</HI> But not to pay so great a summe of debtes.</P>
<P>It now remayneth to speake of his Entrade, or Re∣uenue: For a Prince cannot haue peace without war, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> warre without men, nor men without money,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Reue∣nue.</HI></NOTE> nor money without meanes: nor are there any meanes but these, viz.

Second∣ly, Conquests. Thirdly, Giftes of his friends. Fourthly, Pension of his Confederates. Fiftly, Traffike. Sixtly, Im∣positions vpon Marchandise, brought in, or carried out. Seuenthly, Impositions vpon his Subiects. And yet one other, which the Kings of France haue lately in∣uented to helpe, when all other fayled, which is, Eight∣ly, the sales of Offices, more dangerous and preiudici∣all to the State, then any other.</P>
<P>Of these 8. meanes I wil giue you particular obserua∣tions, and then conclude, what is generally holden to be the whole Reuenue of the Crowne of France, by all these meanes.</P>
<P>First, the Domayne is, as it were,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Do∣maine.</HI></NOTE> the Dowre which the State brings to the King her Husband, for her tuiti∣on, defence, and maintenance: And therefore one saith, <HI>n' est au Roy ains à la Coronne</HI>: Belongs not to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. l.</HI> 3.</NOTE> but to the Crowne.</P>
<P><PB REF="52"/>There are 2. sorts of Domaines, First, the rent which the King holds in his hands, of the Feifes giuen for ser∣uice: Secondly, that which is vnited and incorporate to the Crowne. The rights of the Domaine are these: <HI>Rents, Fifts, payments at alienations, tributes, peages, toll,</HI> of whatsoeuer enters or comes out of Cities, woods, forrests, and diuers other.</P>
<P>This is the most ancient and most lawfull ground and foundation of Finances: For yee shall obserue in <HI>Liuy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Liuy li.</HI> 1.</NOTE> that at the first there were in the territorie of <HI>Rome,</HI> onely eighteene thousand Acres of land, whereof one third was for the Church and sacrifices, another for the Resp. and the rest for particular men. This is also confir∣med by <HI>Dionisius Halicarnasseus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dion. Hali. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Plinie.</HI></NOTE> who liued with Master <HI>Varro,</HI> the true Register of the Romane antiquities, as <HI>Bodin</HI> cals him. A Citizen of Rome had but two Acres, but after the expulsion of <HI>Tarquinius,</HI> they had 7. apiece. This diuision among the <HI>Romanes,</HI> was deriued from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who did diuide their whole land into three parts:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diod li.</HI> 2.</NOTE> One for the Church, another for the King, and the third for the Calasyres.</P>
<P>That is Domaine, which belongeth to the Crowne: First, either by Possession, time out of mind: Or second∣ly, by Reunion, for want of heires males, as the Appen∣nages when they returne: Thirdly, or by Confusion, for want of such as can make iust claime, much like our concealed lands in England: Or lastly, by Confiscati∣on of offenders inheritances.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comment. de l' Estat.</HI></NOTE>Of this last sort wee reade, that in the time of <HI>Saint Lewes,</HI> there were confisked to the Domaine, the Coun∣ties of <HI>Dreax, Bray, Fortyonne,</HI> and <HI>Monstreuil, Langue∣docke, Guyenne, Aniowe, Maine, Turraine, Auuergne</HI>:
<PB REF="52" MS="y"/>
And after, in the time of <HI>Philip,</HI> the Duchy of <HI>Alençon,</HI> the Counties of <HI>Perche, Perigort, Poutieu, La Marche An∣goulesme,</HI> &amp; Marquisate of <HI>Saluzzes.</HI> But <HI>Bodin</HI> saith, most of this came to the Crowne by force: <HI>La sieur de la ser∣re</HI>: He saith, it came by way of exchange or purchase. But the Author of the Comentaries, of the estate of the Religion, and policie of France, is of the first opini∣on. Thus great was the Domayne in former times, that of it selfe, without oppressing the people with Imposi∣tions, it was sufficient to maintayne the State and great∣nesse of the Kings of France, but it is now vtterly wasted.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dern. troubl.</HI></NOTE> <HI>On sçait bien que le Domaine qui seul entretenoit la splendeur et le lustre de l' estat Royal, n' est tel qu'il estoit de temps du regne des roys Loys,</HI> 11. <HI>Ch.</HI> 8. <HI>et.

The continuance of our warrs, hath caused it to be engaged in many hands, in such sort, that there is neede of more then fifteene or 16. thousand pound Sterling, to redeeme that which is worth aboue 5. millions of poundes. And <HI>Bodin</HI> saith, that almost all the Counties, Baronies, and Seigneu∣ries of the Domaine, are aliened for the ninth or tenth part of that they be worth. Yee must obserue, that the lands of the Domaine are not alienable, but in two ca∣ses. 1. <HI>Pour l' Apennage des freres.</HI> 2. <HI>Pour les guerres.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. l.</HI> 3.</NOTE> 1. For the Apēnage of the Kings brother. 2. For the warres: &amp; these must be cōfirmed by the Arrest of the Parliament.
<PB REF="53"/>
For in all other cases, all Lawyers and Historiens of France agree, that it is inalienable, and many Arrests haue beene made of late yeeres to confirme it. I haue read, that the <HI>Charta magna</HI> of England saith, the Kings when they are crowned, take an othe, not to aliene it: so doe they heere in France. And there is no prescription of time, to make such sales or alienations good, but that they may bee recouered and repurchased, whensoeuer the Crowne is able.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Cato Cens.</HI></NOTE>To this purpose <HI>Plutarch</HI> sayth well, <HI>Men cannot prescribe against God, nor particulars against the Respub∣lique.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Con∣quest.</HI></NOTE>2. Concerning the second meanes of raysing mony by Conquests, the present state of France can yeeld no example, it hath bene long on the losing hand: but ye shall read, that the Turke dayly, when hee conquereth a Prouince or Countrey, giues the Lands to such as shal serue him in the Warres, whom he sendeth thither as it were Colonies, to enioy eche one his portion of some foure and twenty Acres of our measure, or as o∣ther reckon, thirty. He giues them also Wheat to seed their land, vpon condition to pay him halfe the fruits of the seuenth yeere, and halfe of the twelfth: and when the party dies, his goods goe to the Turke: so that the <HI>parties casuelles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parties Casuelles in France, is onely sale of Offices.</HI></NOTE> casualties (as they heere call them) is a great reuenue to him.</P>
<P>So the Spanyard hath sent of his people into <HI>Peru,</HI> there to inhabit (much like this course the Turke takes) and from thence yerely receyueth to the value of two millions, that is, the fift of such Gold and siluer, and o∣ther commodities, as are there found.</P>
<P N="3">3. For the third meanes, it is now out of season: it
<PB REF="53" MS="y"/>
was vsed in that good olde world, when <HI>on se mouchoit sur le manche:</HI> Men wiped their nose on their sleeue, (as the French man sayes:) for now Princes are so farre from giuing, as they hardly pay that they owe.</P>
<P>Of these gifts yee shall reade in <HI>Polibius, Florus,</HI> and o∣thers: As of the King of Aegypt, who sent to the Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> when it was distressed by <HI>Hanniball,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Liuy. l.</HI> 38</NOTE> the summe of 400000. Crownes. And <HI>Hieron</HI> of <HI>Sicili</HI> sent them a Crowne of gold, of three hundred poundes weight. They of <HI>Rhodes</HI> had an olde ruinous Colosse fell downe, which stood hard by the Key, and in the fall brake three or foure Shippes: to repayre which losse, the King of Egypt sent them 1800000. Crownes in gold, besides a great quantity of siluer, and three thousand <HI>muyds</HI> of wheate: <HI>Hieron</HI> sent them 60000. Crownes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Polib. l.</HI> 4.</NOTE> So did <HI>Pto∣lemey</HI> send great gifts to them of <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> And ye shall reade of sixe kingdoms giuen to the Romanes, by testa∣ment: and the Dutchy of <HI>Guelderland</HI> giuen to the Duke of <HI>Burgogne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines.</HI></NOTE> not much aboue an hundred yeeres since.</P>
<P N="4">4 The fourth meanes also of Pension, which Princes haue vpon some consideration of their Allies,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pension</HI></NOTE> helpeth the French Kings Cosers nothing at all: for they ra∣ther giue then take: As for example, to diuers cantons of the <HI>Swisses,</HI> to whome at first they payd not aboue one hundred and twentie thousand <HI>liures</HI> yeerely: but for these fifty yeeres, they neuer pay lesse the yere, then two millions. For sayth <HI>Commines, Lewes</HI> 11. entred league with the <HI>Swisses,</HI> and they into his Pension: to whom he yeerely gaue fortie thousand Flourins, where∣of twentie to the Cities, and twentie to particular men, vpon condition to haue a certayne proportion of their
<PB REF="54"/>
forces to serue him in his Warres vpon all occasions. An aduantagious alliance for the Swisse in my opini∣on, who by this meanes enrich themselues, cleare their Countrey of many idle and bad members, and lastly, breede good Souldiers, to serue themselues vpon need, at another mans cost. The <HI>Turke</HI> hath also a pension of the <HI>Emperour</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. li.</HI> 5</NOTE> for certaine Lands he holdeth in <HI>Hungarie:</HI> which he notwithstanding vanteth to be a Tribute. Many examples might bee alleadged of this kinde, as of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedone,</HI> that by pensions got all <HI>Greece</HI> partial on his side:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Ly∣sander.</HI></NOTE> and the Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> by pen∣sion, got euer the Forces of <HI>Asia</HI> diuerted.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Traf∣ficke.</HI></NOTE>5 The fift, which is of Trafficke, auaileth nothing the French Kings: for they holde it heere a base and sordid kind of profession for a Gentleman, much more for a King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. li.</HI> 6</NOTE> to trade by Marchandize. And by the Lawes of <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> hee loseth the quali∣tie of a Nobleman, that doth trafficke. The Law <HI>Clodia</HI> forbad a <HI>Romane</HI> Senatour to trade, or haue Shippe of burthen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iuy li.</HI> 21.</NOTE> <HI>Quaestus omnis patribus indecorus visus est</HI>: The Senatours esteemed any kinde of trade or trafficke vn∣worthy of their ranke. And the <HI>Emperours</HI> Law forbad all Gentlemen and Churchmen to vse it.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these Lawes, and the disparage∣ment that it brings to Nobilitie (for saith <HI>Tully,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cice. offic.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Merca∣tores sunt sordidum genus hominum,</HI> Marchants are a base kinde of people) yet so sweete is the sauour of gaine, that many haue vsed this as no small meanes to encrease their Finances. The great Duke of <HI>Tuscaine</HI> present, gaines infinitely this way, and the more by his most vnlawfull and tyrannous Monopolies: for hee com∣monly buyeth vp all the graine of his owne Countrie,
<PB REF="54" MS="y"/>
at his owne price: yea, and that which commeth from other places also, and then sendeth out a <HI>Bando</HI> or Pro∣clamation, that no man shall sell any Corne through∣out his State, till his owne be solde, forcing also all Ba∣kers and other people to buy thereof. This maner of en∣grossing <HI>Alphonsus</HI> of <HI>Arragon</HI> also vsed, by the testimo∣nie of <HI>Bodin.</HI> The Kings of <HI>Portugall</HI> also, and the <HI>Seig∣noria</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> haue bene great traders by Marchandise, but it hath beene in an honester fashion, at Sea, and not to the grinding of their poore Subiects. The Nobilitie also of <HI>Italy,</HI> in all Cities (except <HI>Naples</HI>) holde it no dis∣honour to trafficke in grosse, as yee shall generally ob∣serue when yee come into that Countrie.</P>
<P N="6">6 The sixt meanes of raising money vpon all wares and Marchandise,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Impost vpon Marchan∣dise.</HI></NOTE> that come in &amp; goe out of the Coun∣trie, is the most ancient and best agreeing with reason, and vsed by all Princes in the world. The late troubles haue made the benefit hereof very small to the Crowne of France, for these many yeeres past. The particulars comprised vnder this branch, are these: <HI>Le haut passage, ou Domaine foraine,</HI> and <HI>La traicte foraine.</HI> Customes in∣ward, and outward:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. li.</HI> 5</NOTE> By these the Prince is to haue Impost, <HI>Cinq pour cent,</HI> fiue in the hundred: so much iust had the <HI>Romanes, Teste Cicerone in Praetura Siciliensi,</HI> As <HI>Cicero</HI> witnesseth in his Pretorship of <HI>Sicilia.</HI> The <HI>Turke</HI> takes, <HI>Dix <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our cent,</HI> Ten in the hundred of the stranger, and <HI>cinq,</HI> fiue, of the Subiect: the <HI>French</HI> quite contrary.

<P>This is like the Gabel vpon all maner of foode, which the Princes take of their Subiects through <HI>Italy,</HI> or the Assise vpon bread and beere which the <HI>States</HI> haue in the Low countryes▪ a grieuance, whereof we smart not in England, as also we are free frō many other burthens, which the people of these Countries are forced to beare: and yet yee shall heare our people (therefore ig∣norant of their owne happinesse, which they enioy vn∣der the blessed Gouernement of our gracious Soue∣raigne, because they knew not the miseries of others) murmure and grudge at the payment of a Taxe or Sub∣sidie, as a matter insupportable, which, in comparison of the impositions laide vpon others, is a matter of no∣thing.</P>
<P>Touching the Gabell of Salt (which is also compri∣sed vnder this head) Some say it was first erected by <HI>Philippe le Long</HI>: Others by <HI>Philip de Valois,</HI> 1328. True it is, that the ordinance of <HI>Francis</HI> the first, 1541. sets downe an impost of twentie foure <HI>Liures</HI> vpon euery <HI>Muy</HI>: And in the yeere 1543. an ordinance was made for Gabell, to be taken vpon all Sea-fish salted. And in 1544. it was ordained, that all Salt should bee sold and distributed into the <HI>Magazines,</HI> or Storehouses of euery
<PB REF="55" MS="y"/>
seuerall generalitie. The benefit of this one commodi∣tie, hath beene very commodious to the Crowne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dern. trou.</HI></NOTE> till the yere eightie one, whē the King was forced for want of money to let it out to others: whereby he lost, as is in my Authour prooued, eight hundred thirtie sixe thou∣sand Crownes yeerely. Here is also a kinde of taxe, cal∣led the <HI>Equiuallent,</HI> that is, an imposition laide vpon some persons and places (but not generally) to haue li∣bertie to buy and sell Salt, and to be exempt from the <HI>Magazines.</HI></P>
<P>The Impost of Wine is laide vpon all, without ex∣ception or exemption whatsoeuer, it is the twentieth part to the King: besides all other rights, as of Billots, entring into Cities, passages by land or ryuer, and such like: Besides, a later imposition of fiue <HI>Sols</HI> vpon euery <HI>Muy,</HI> leuied by <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth 1561.</P>
<P>Concerning the (<HI>Traicte foraine</HI>) it is of like nature with the Aides, saue that it is leuiable vpon more parti∣cular sorts of Marchandise: besides, the Aides is an Im∣post vpon things spent in the Land: and the <HI>Traicte for∣raine,</HI> is of such commodities as are transported out: As of Wheate, Rie, Barley, Oates, Wine, Vineger, Veriuice, Cidre, Beefes, Muttons, Veales, Lambes, Swine, Horses, Lard, Bacon, Tallow, Oyle, Cheese, Fish of all sortes, Drougs of all sorts, Mettals of all sortes, Silkes and clothes of all sorts, Leather of all sorts; and finally all o∣ther marchandise, as Fruites, Parchment, Paper, Glasse, Wood, Roopes, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7 The seuenth ground or foundation of Finances,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Impositi∣on vpon the Sub∣iect.</HI></NOTE> is the <HI>Imposition</HI> vpon the Subiect: that is, not vpon the Wares or commodities, but vpon the persons them∣selues, according to their abilitie, and it is much like the
<PB REF="56"/>
leuying of the taxe and subsidie in England, where eue∣ry one payeth rateably to the lands and goods he posses∣seth. And therefore <HI>Haillan</HI> iudgeth well, to say, they bee neither personall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hail. l.</HI> 3.</NOTE> nor reall, but mixt, <HI>imposées au lieu du domicile, ayant esgard à tousles biens du taillable, en quelque part qu' ils soyent assis et posez</HI>: Assessed in the place of their dwelling, according to all the goods of the partie asses∣sed, in what part soeuer they lye or abide.</P>
<P>These (<HI>tailles</HI>) were first raysed by Saint <HI>Lewes</HI> (but by way of extraordinary Subsidie.) <HI>Charles</HI> the 7. made them ordinary for the maintenance of his <HI>Gendarmerie.</HI> And whereas at first they were neuer leuyed but by consent of the three States, and to endure but while the warre lasted, he made them perpetuall. Therefore saith one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. li.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>Ce qu'estoit accordè par grace, est depuis venu patrimoni∣al et hereditaire aux roys</HI>: That which was at first yeelded of fauour, is become since patrimoniall and hereditarie to our Kings. (But this is a common course, I thinke there is no countrey in <HI>Europe</HI> but can giue instances therof.) There is yet to be obserued, that these <HI>tailles</HI> are onely lyable vpon the <HI>Plat païs</HI> (the County) all Cities are exempt, as also all Officers of the Kings house, all Counsellors, Lawyers, and Officers of Courtes of Par∣liament, all the Nobilitie, the <HI>Gensdarmes,</HI> the Officers of warre, the Graduates of Vniuersities, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The (<HI>taillon</HI>) is another imposition, raised by <HI>Henrie,</HI> 2. anno, 1549. which was to amend the wages of the <HI>gens∣darmes,</HI> who by reason of the smalnesse of their pay, lay vpon the poore villages, and ate them vp; for the ease whereof this imposition was deuised, which also lyeth vpon the poore Countrey-man: whereby at first hee was somewhat eased: But now all is peruerted; the
<PB REF="56" MS="y"/>
poore is still oppressed, and yet he payeth still both <HI>taille</HI> and <HI>taillon.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, there is the <HI>sold,</HI> or pay of 50000. foote, which ye may remember were erected by <HI>Lewes</HI> the eleuenth, in eight legions, sixe thousand to a legion, which with their Officers, come about this number. To maintaine these Legions, there was a taxe leuyed vpon all sortes of persons priuiledged in the (<HI>taille</HI>) but onely the Nobles. (There are also the <HI>Decymes</HI> (Tenthes) leuyed vpon the Church.) For the leuying of the <HI>taille, taillon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem. li.</HI> 3</NOTE> and <HI>sold de</HI> 50000. <HI>gens a pied,</HI> wages of 50000. foote. Ye must note, that the King sends his Letters Patentes by Commissio∣ners, to the Treasurers of each Generalitie: these, accor∣ding to the summe, rate each Election, (this is, as yee would say, a hundred in a shire, or a Bailywike) and then send to these Elections, to haue the said summe gathered in their seuerall Townes, and Hamlets, according as they be rated.</P>
<P>So doe they to the <HI>Maieures, Consuls, Escheuins,</HI> and chiefe Officers of euery City, that are lyable to any of these payments, who rating euery man according to his abilitie, giue these Rolles to certayne Collectors to gather it vp: These are bound to bring it quarterly to the Receiuers. These carry it to the Receiuers gene∣rall, in the same <HI>species</HI> that they receiued it: and from them to haue an Acquittance, after the Ac∣counts haue beene perused by the Controler gene∣rall.</P>
<P>And these are all the meanes, by which Princes rayse their Finances, whereof yee see some, nothing to pertayne to the French King, but to others; and some to him onely, not to others.</P>
<P N="8"><PB REF="57"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sale of Offices</HI></NOTE>8 There yet remayneth one other meanes (though extraordinary) to a Prince, to get money, which the ne∣cessities of the times, and the want of other meanes, haue forced the French Kings of late yeeres to vse. This is the vent or sales of Offices, a very dangerous &amp; hurtfull Marchandize, both for the Prince and subiect. This Lesson (sayth <HI>Bodin</HI>) the French Kings first learned of the Popes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 6.</NOTE> with whom it is still as familiar, as olde, to sell Bishopricks, liuings, &amp; Ecclesiasticall promotions. A course,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dern. troub.</HI></NOTE> saith one <HI>de grāde consequence &amp; tres-perilleuse, mais couuerte de necessité:</HI> of great and dangerous con∣sequence, but cloked with necessity. It is indeed thrice dangerous, because sales of offices cause sales of Iustice: for what these Purchasers pay in grosse, they must needs get in retayle, forgetting what was sayd to <HI>Sopho∣cles,</HI> the Gouernour of <HI>Athens, Il faut qu'vn Gouerneur ait non seulement les mains nettes, mais les yeur aussi</HI>: A Go∣uernour must not onely haue his hands cleane, but his eyes also.

For these, by selling Iustice, and rob∣bing the poore of their right, giue the fatherlesse and oppressed Widdowe iust cause to complayne, and of wearing that mourning robe that <HI>Plutarch</HI> speakes of.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Lewes,</HI> among many other good Lawes, and reuocation of diuers impositions extraordinary, made also an Edict against the sale of Offices. And it is re∣ported of <HI>Alexander Seuerus</HI>▪<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. l.</HI> 3</NOTE> that he should say when one offered a peece of money for a certayne Office, <HI>Non patiar mercatores potestatum</HI>: I will suffer none to traffique Offices.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spartian.</HI></NOTE> Therefore sayth the Athenian Orator
<PB REF="57" MS="y"/>
to <HI>Timar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus, That the liues, not the Purses of them that stoode for Offices, were to be looked into.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Demosthe∣nes.</HI></NOTE> And yee shall reade in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> that he which anciently stoode for an Office in <HI>Rome,</HI> was to shew himselfe certaine dayes before the Election, in the <HI>Forum</HI> or open streetes, apparelled in a thinne Robe, that through the same, the people might see the wounds he had had in the Warres for his Countries seruice, and thereafter as he had deserued,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plu. Cori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> to choose him. And lest any man should by briberie, corruption, or any such indirect and vnlawfull way, seeke to get any Office or Authoritie, these olde <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> made many good and wholesome Lawes, against such maner of proceedings (which they called <HI>Ambi∣tus</HI>) i. an Ambicious seeking of preferment. This the <HI>Lex Petilia</HI> forbad:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. li.</HI> 5</NOTE> The <HI>Lex Calphurnia</HI> declared them that were detected of any such course, to be vncapable of that Office for euer.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cicer. pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Muraen.</HI></NOTE> And the <HI>Lex Tullia</HI> banished them that were conuinced (<HI>Ambitus</HI>) for ten yeeres: so hatefull were such purchases in those dayes.</P>
<P>And in the time of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turquet. hist Sp.</HI></NOTE> they had the like law in Spaine, against the buying of any Office, whether of Warre or Iustice: <HI>Que vse quedam vender ny trocar, of∣ficios de Alcaldid, ny Algnaziladgo, ny Regimiento, ny vientes quatria, ny fid executoria, ny iuraderia.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you may obserue, how hurtfull soeuer it be to Common-wealths, and how much so euer forbidden, yet that necessitie oftentimes forceth Princes, to that which is most losse to themselues. <HI>La pauuretè quelques fois contraint le Roy de casser bonnes loix pour subuenir à se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affaires: et depuis qu' vne fois on a faict ceste ouuerture il est presqu' impossible d' y remedier:</HI> Pouertie sometimes con∣straineth
<PB REF="58"/>
the King to breake good Lawes, to helpe his affaires, and when once this hole is made in the Lawes, it is almost impossible to keepe it.</P>
<P>It is a strange thing to consider, and incredible to be∣leeue, what infinite masses of money haue bene made heere in <HI>France</HI> by these sales, where there is not that Collector, Cōtroller, Treasurer, Sergeant, or subalterne Office whatsoeuer, but he hath bought it of the Prince, and at no small rate: for I haue heard it credibly repor∣ted, and yee shall reade also in late writers, that these Offices are bought in <HI>France</HI> at a dearer rate then our Lands in <HI>England</HI> of twentie yeeres purchase. Yee must obserue they haue them for terme of life, and after, to returne to the King who is againe to sell them. A man in his sicknes, or in danger of death, or vpon any neede whatsoeuer, may sell this his Office, or resigne it to his Sonne or friend whatsoeuer: which sale is good, if the party liue fortie daies after the sale or resignation is con∣firmed, otherwise not. Now we are to consider, what Entrade or Reuenew, the French King yeerely maketh by any or all of the meanes abouesaid.</P>
<P>The estate of the Finances, Domaine, and al in <HI>Charles</HI> the sixt time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 6.</NOTE> Anno 1449. was but 1400000. <HI>Liures.

<P><PB REF="58" MS="y"/>But yee may obserue, that this summe is of late yeres growne much greater, (by two thirds) as is generally beleeued: for whereas in those dayes, some three or fourescore yeeres, since the ordinarie summe was fif∣teene millions of <HI>Francs</HI> or <HI>Liures,</HI> it is now so many of Crownes. And <HI>Monsieur Riuault,</HI> Treasurer to the Duke of <HI>Mayenne,</HI> shamed not some eight yeres since to say, that his Master had improued the Realme of France to a better rent, then any Prince had done beforetimes: For saith he,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Muheustro et Mana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI></NOTE> <HI>Au lieu qu' il ne vallait que dix huict ou vingt millions, il en vaut auiour d'huy cinquante</HI>: Whereas it was woorth but eighteene or twentie thousand pound sterling, it is now woorth fiue millions sterling.</P>
<P>And another saith, that onely by the sales of Offices in twentie yeeres space,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dern. troub.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Le Roy en a tire cent trent et neuf millions</HI>: The King hath raysed one hundred thirtie and nine millions, which is after the rate of seuen millions the yeere. So that it is probably to be inferred, that the Reuenewes are at lest fifteene millions of Crownes; wherein all late writers agree: Neither must we thinke, that men are mistaken, by counting Crownes for <HI>Liures</HI> (considering that <HI>Bodin,</HI> and <HI>La Nouë,</HI> and most elder writers speake onely of <HI>Liures,</HI> not of Crownes.) For the maner of Accompt of France, is by especiall ordinance commaunded to bee made by Crownes, and that of <HI>Liures</HI> to cease: So that whensoeuer yee reade in the Stories of France, of any summe of thousands, millions, or such like, without naming either <HI>francs</HI> or Crownes: you are to respect the times when it was written: for if it was aboue twentie yeeres past, they meane <HI>Liures</HI> or <HI>Francs</HI>: if of latter yeres then twentie, it is alwayes to be

vnderstoode they speake of Crownes: this rule will not faile you.</P>
<P>Hauing briefely spoken of his <HI>Entrade,</HI> and sufficient∣ly of the meanes by which he raiseth it, as especially by the last, which is not the least: namely, the sales of Offices, which are now bestowed, not vpon them which can execute them best, but such as can giue the most; of whome we may say, as <HI>Commines</HI> of them of his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines.</HI></NOTE> presently after the Battell of <HI>Montlherry, Tel perdoit ses offices et estats pour s' en estre fuy, et furent donnes à autres qui auoyent fuy dix lieües plus loing:</HI> Some lost their Offi∣ces and estates for running away, the which were be∣stowed vpon others, that ranne ten leagues further: So these Offices were taken from them that pilled the peo∣ple much, and bestowed vpon others that pill them ten times more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Officers of his Fi∣nances.</HI></NOTE>Hauing, I say, spoken sufficiently of these, it remai∣neth I keepe the same course I haue done hitherto: that is, after the relation of the Court, to reckon vp the Of∣ficers of Court, and after the discourse of his Forces, to speake of his Officers of warre: So here likewise after mention made of his Finances and Reuenewes, to re∣member his Financers and Officers, vsed for the Col∣lection, keeping and disposing of the same. Of which officers, we may say, as the Philosopher sayes of wiues, that they be <HI>Mala necessaria</HI>: Necessarie euils. And as he saith of them, The lesse of euils is the best: so say we of these, The fewer the better. But when wee reade, that the olde <HI>Romanes</HI> had of these but one in a Prouince, you shall obserue heere in some Prouince not so fewe as one thousand.</P>
<P><PB REF="59" MS="y"/>The chiefe of these is the <HI>Treasurer d'Espargne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Treasu∣rer d' Es∣pargne. Treas. de parties casuelles. Treas. generaux. Treas. de menus pl.</HI></NOTE> of the Exchequer, instituted in <HI>Francis</HI> the first his time, in place of the Receyuer generall. There is also another Treasurer of the <HI>parties casuelles,</HI> Casualties. The third sort are the Treasurers <HI>generaux des Finances,</HI> whom also they call Treasurers of France; (for as for the Treasurers ordinary and extraordinary of the Warres, we haue al∣ready spoke of them in the relation of his forces, and of the Treasurer <HI>de menus plaisirs,</HI> of his petty pleasures, when we spoke of his Court.) The number of these Treasurers generall, as also of all other Officers of Fi∣nances, ye may partly conceaue by the number of Ge∣neralities which are in France, and the seuerall Offices of eche one of these.</P>
<P>Of these Generalities are twenty &amp; one in all <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Generali∣ties.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Paris, Rouen, Caen, Nantes, Toures, Burges, Poictiers, Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Tholouse, Montpellier, Aix, Grenoble, Lion, Ryon, Dyon, Cha∣alons, Amyens, Orleans, Soissons, Lymoges, Moulin.</HI></P>
<P>In eche of these Generalities are diuers Elections,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Elections</HI></NOTE> that is, diuers places for the Receipt of the Finances: As in that of <HI>Orleans</HI> are eleuen Elections, in the rest some more, and some lesse, to the number of 170. in al.</P>
<P>In euery Generality are ten Treasurers;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Receiuers.</HI></NOTE> three Recei∣uers generall of the Finances; three Receyuers generall of the <HI>Taillon</HI>; one Receiuer generall of the <HI>Dismes</HI>; two Receyuers generall of the Woods: And for euery Re∣ceiuer, so many Controlers generall:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Contro∣lers.</HI></NOTE> two Treasurers generall of the extraordinary of the Warre, for the payment of Garrisons and Souldiers in time of Warre.</P>
<P>Besides all these generall Officers, there are also in eche particular Election, three Receyuers of the <HI>Taille,</HI>
<PB REF="60"/>
three of the Aides, two of the <HI>Taillon,</HI> &amp; as many Con∣trolers, besides all other inferior Officers. If then there be thus many in one Election onely, ye may iudge the infinite number in all France, vpon which they lye, as thicke as the Grassehoppers in Aegypt.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chamber of Ac∣counts.</HI></NOTE>I must here also remember the Chamber of Ac∣counts, the chiefe Court of the Finances: wherein are foure Presidents, twelue Masters, eighteene Auditors, foure Correctors, one Procuror generall, one aduocate, one greffier, sixe huissiers, or Sergeants, and other infe∣rior Officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 5.</NOTE> to the number (as <HI>Bodin</HI> sayth) of two hun∣dred, besides seruants (and it is likely, the number is not lessened since his time.)</P>
<P>In conclusion, the Officers here, and of other places, are so exceeding many, as a President of this Court shewed the Estates of France, in the assembly at <HI>Blois,</HI> that of the <HI>Escu,</HI> sixe shillings, which was payd by the Subiect, there came but a <HI>teston,</HI> 1. shilling 8. pence to the Kings Cofers.</P>
<P>Many motions haue beene made, from time to time, for the redresse hereof, but the faction of Financers is so strong, and the summe so huge, which the King owes them, that it is remedilesse.</P>
<P>The Court of Aides also is as full of Offices, as that o∣ther.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Court of Aides. Haill. l.</HI> 4</NOTE> These Finances (saith one) <HI>ont esté brouillées, alte∣rées, changées, et reduictes en art si obscure, que peu de gens y entendent, ou peuuent y entendre, s' ils ne sont nourrys en la Ca∣balle, de ceux qui l'ont obscurcie:</HI> haue bene so shuffled, alte∣red, changed, and reduced into so obscure an Arte, that very few either do, or can vnderstand it, except they haue bene brought vp in their Cabale that haue obscu∣red it.

<P>Howbeit, hauing now wound my selfe out of the la∣borsome Laborinth thereof, directed by the clew of the best writers, and most iudicious Informers, that as yet I could meete withall, I will proceede to relate of the rest, and first of the Kings Coyne, for that ye know these Financers are neuer without money: and next that, I will remember the Administration of Iustice, and so by consequent speake of the Courts, Iudges, Lawyers, and such like, who, of all people in the world, hunt after it with greatest greedinesse.</P>
<P>The Coynes of France, are either of Gold, Siluer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Coyne.</HI></NOTE> or Brasse. In those of Gold I must be better instructed my selfe, for I know not but the Crowne, which is of three or foure sorts, whereof that of the Sunne is the best, and the halfe Crowne. Those of Siluer are these, the <HI>Liure</HI> or <HI>Franc,</HI> which is 2. shillings sterling: The <HI>quart d' escu,</HI> which is 1. shilling, 6. pence. The <HI>Teston,</HI> which is halfe a <HI>soubs</HI> lesse: The peece of tenne <HI>soubs,</HI> which is 1. shilling sterling: the halfe <HI>quardescu,</HI> the halfe <HI>teston,</HI> and the peece of fiue <HI>soubs,</HI> that is sixe pence sterling. Those of Brasse, is the peece of sixe Blanks, which is three pence: that of three blankes, three halfe pence. The <HI>soubs</HI> of 12. <HI>deniers</HI>: the <HI>liard</HI> of foure <HI>deniers,</HI> the <HI>double,</HI> of two: and lastly, the <HI>denier</HI> it selfe, whereof tenne make 1. peny ster∣ling. This baser and smaller kinde of money, hath not beene vsed in France, but since the beginning of the ci∣uill warres. The <HI>Teston</HI> is the best siluer. It is a general and a true complaint, that the Coyne is much lesse in France, then it hath beene, and that there is the better
<PB REF="61"/>
halfe of French Crownes gone out of the land within these twenty yeres: whereof is no maruell, considering that marchandise hath almost lien dead, the Countrey vnfruitfull, because vntilled, and many troups of for∣rayne Soldiers, especially of Swisses and Reisters, heere all the while payd.</P>
<P>Howsoeuer it decrease in France, true it is that <HI>Bodin</HI> sayth, that it increaseth generally in all these West coun∣tries of the world; as also that they haue lesse and lesse in the East parts:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Strabo.</HI></NOTE> For so he reporteth out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> that in former times the Kings of Egypt raysed yeerely vpon their people seuen millions and a halfe.

But in these Countries, as yee see by this Realme of France, the Reuenues still grow greater and greater: of this the abundance of money is no little cause: So is it also the cause, that the prices of all wares are growne, not that things are now more scarce, or people more plentifull, which some will needs perswade themselues to beleeue.</P>

And anno, 1587. an assembly called at <HI>Blois,</HI> for the reformation of the State, &amp; punish∣ment of diuers abuses in Magistrates (as the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> pretended) and for the deposing of the King, as some thought that he entended: others say, that he had here plotted to kill the King, and that the King had but the start of the Duke one day: for if he had deferred the death of the <HI>Guise</HI> till the next day, the lot had fallen vp∣on himselfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. du Fay.</HI></NOTE> There is a very iudicious late writer, who discoursing of this assembly at <HI>Blois,</HI> where the three E∣states excepted against the Kings ill Gouernment, com∣playneth, that of late they are growne too insolent in their demaunds.

For in former times, the Kings contenting themselues with their Domaine, and impost of such wares, as came in, or went out of the land, (the two most ancient, and most iust grounds of Finances) were not accustomed to leuy and impose vpon their Subiects any taxe whatsoeuer, without the consent of the three States, thus assembled.

<P>Of these Courts of Parliament, ye haue eight in France. That of <HI>Paris,</HI> the most ancient &amp; highest in pre∣eminence, which at first was ambulatory (as they call it) &amp; euer followed the K. Court, whither soeuer it wēt: but

<P>The Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> consists of seuen Cham∣bers: the <HI>Grande chambre,</HI> and fiue others of Enquests: and the <HI>Tournelles,</HI> which is the Chamber for the crimi∣nall causes, as the other sixe be for the ciuill. It is cal∣led the <HI>Tournelles,</HI> because the Iudges of the other Chambers sit there by turnes, euery three moneths: the reason whereof <HI>Bodin</HI> giues,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 4.</NOTE> that it might not alter
<PB REF="63" MS="y"/>
the naturall inclination of the Iudges, and make them more cruell, by being alwayes exercised in matter of condemnations, and executions. There bee of this Court, of Presidents, Councellors, Cheualliers of ho∣nour, Procureurs, Aduocates, Clerkes, Sergeants, and o∣ther Officers of all sortes, not so few as two hundred.</P>
<P>Besides this Court, there are also other Courtes for the administration of Iustice, in this Citie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Courts of Chatellets</HI></NOTE> as the <HI>Chatel∣let</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> with a Lieutenant ciuill, and another crimi∣nall, and the <HI>Hostel de Paris,</HI> with a Preuost, and other in∣feriour Officers, which is, as ye would say, the Guild Hall of the Citie. So haue ye throughout the Realme certayne places, (as all Cities in generall) where there be <HI>Chatellets</HI> (like our places of Assise) and in them a Lieu∣tenant, ciuill and criminall, to iudge and determine all causes, reall, or personall, and here many Lawyers and Procurers (as are our Councellors at law, &amp; Atturnies) who pleade before these Lieutenants, and Preuosts, and certaine Councellors, which are the Iudges in these Courts, whereof the number is incredible in France. Insomuch as ye may well say of them, as is said of <HI>Sienna, There be more readers, then auditors: so here be more Pleaders thē Clients.</HI> This <HI>Chiquanerie</HI> (pettifogging) &amp; multiplici∣tie of pleaders, came first from the Popes Court, when his Seate was at <HI>Auignon</HI> (as my Author saith) who in the same place calles these Aduocates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. l.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>les Sourris de Pa∣lais</HI>: The Mice of the Palace.

the Collicke (saith he) finding a worse deuill then him∣selfe rumbling in his belly, as there was no stirre with the collericke Marchant, till he was bound.</P>
<P>The processes and sutes in these Courts throughout France, are innumerable, wherein wee come nothing neere them; and yet there is no want of these in Eng∣land: for I haue heard of 340. <HI>Nisi prius</HI> betweene par∣ties tryed at one Assise in Norff. (as many I thinke, as in halfe England besides.) But these are only twice in the yeere, that causes are tried at Assizes in our Countrey, whereas heere they are tried euery day in the yere, that is not festiuall: So that it is not much vnlikely, that here are as many Processes in seuen yeres, as haue beene in England since the Conquest.</P>

<P>There is also the Court of the <HI>Eauës et Forests,</HI> kept at the Table of Marble in the Palaice, and infinit others, which to speake particularly of, would be very tedious, and not very necessary. I will here onely remember you
<PB REF="64" MS="y"/>
of the two Counsels, which I must confesse, not to haue their due place: for I should haue spoken of them next after the Court of Parliament, or if ye will, next after the Assemblie.</P>
<P>The chiefe of these, as being alwayes about the King, is the <HI>Conseil priué,</HI> or <HI>des affaires</HI>: Priuy Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Priuy Councell.</HI></NOTE> or Councell of affaires: of these Counsellors (amōg which are his foure Secretaries) he calleth certaine euery mor∣ning at his rising, to whome he communicates apart his principal and most importing affaires, where are read all letters which come from other Princes, and such like publike businesse, &amp; after a conclusiō what is to be done, the dispatch thereof is committed to the Secretaries.</P>
<P>The other, is the <HI>Grand Conseil,</HI> or <HI>Conseil d' Estat</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Grand Conseil.</HI></NOTE> Great Councell, or Councell of Estate: which at first was, as it were, a mēber of the Parliament, &amp; cōsisted of the Prin∣ces of the Bloud, &amp; Nobility, hauing only to deale in the matters of the policy general of France, or of wars, or of the enacting &amp; publishing of Edicts. But the factiō of <HI>Or∣leans</HI> &amp; <HI>Burgundy,</HI> caused it to be changed to a choyse nū∣ber of Counsellors, prouisioned of 1000. crownes pen∣sion a peece yerely. Of this Counsel the Chancellor is chief, for neither the King himself, nor any Prince of the Bloud comes there. This is the Court, of which the Frenchman saith, euery time it is holden, it costs the K. 1000. crownes a day. And now, saith <HI>Haillan,</HI> hee cannot keep thē so cheape, so infinite is the nūber of thē grown. Where he also cōplaines, that this <HI>Conseil d' Estat,</HI> which was wont only to determine publike affaires, as the esta∣blishmēt of Iustice, the Reglemēt of Finances, &amp; redres∣sing of cōmon grieuāces, is now so charged with priuate contentions, as the glory thereof is much diminished.</P>

<P>Secretary is the next Office, who at first were called Clerkes. Some old Writers call them <HI>Tôn aporretôn Grammateast. Suetonius</HI> calles them <HI>Ab Epistolis</HI> or <HI>Ema∣nuenses.</HI> They are eyther of the Finances (which haue their place among the Officers of the Finances, before remembred) or of <HI>Affaires,</HI> which we here speake of: Of these are foure, which are called the principall, <HI>Mon∣sieur Villeroy, Monsieur Geuure, Monsieur de Fresne,</HI> and <HI>Monsieur de Beaulieu.</HI></P>

<P><PB REF="65" MS="y"/>The Gouernours of Cities were in olde time called Dukes, and they of Prouinces, Counts.

<P>This opinion <HI>Bodin</HI> seemes to allowe: But it is rather thought to be true, that the <HI>Comment de l'estat</HI> saith, who of the two hundred millions of Arpens, allowes the Church forty seuen millions, which by particulars of their Vineyards, Meddowes, Arable, Pastures, and Heathes, with their woods, is there set downe: which

<P>Some say, they had the name of <HI>Huguenots,</HI> of the words wherewith they began their Oration, when they prote∣sted against the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which began thus, <HI>Huc nos venimus, &amp;c.</HI> Hither we are come, &amp;c. As they say, the <HI>Wallons</HI> were called of these words, <HI>ou allons nous</HI>? whither go we? when they were driuen out of their owne coun∣try, asking one another whither they should go. But this is not so likely as that of them, who say, that in <HI>Toures</HI> where they first began, there is one of the Gates, called <HI>Hugoes Port,</HI> out of which they of the Religion vsed to passe into the fields, to make their prayers in their pri∣uate assemblies: whereupon they had first the name: for, that one <HI>Hugo</HI> should be the first of that opinion, is ge∣nerally reiected.</P>
<P>I shall not need to say in this place, that this difference in Religion, of these <HI>Catholicks,</HI> and <HI>Huguenots,</HI> is cleere from the slaunder which many lay vpon them, they be∣ing the occasion of all these late troubles in France: for it hath beene sufficiently already proued, that the ambi∣tion of the house of <HI>Guise,</HI> and the parts-taking with them, and those other of <HI>Burbon,</HI> is guilty thereof.</P>
<P>As for Religion, it hath onely beene the cloke, and shaddowe of their ambitious pretences, without the which, they could neuer haue insinuated them∣selues so farre into the hearts of the people, who are alwayes the <HI>gros de la bataille:</HI> The maine Battell: and without whome the Nobilitie may well quarrell, but they cannot fight.</P>

<P>And sure, if there be difference in Nobilitie, as there must needes bee, because the causes bee different; for some are ennobled by their valour and Martiall know∣ledge, and others by their Offices and prudence in the manage of matters of Estate: I see no reason, but that these last should be holden the more noble Nobilitie, if I may so say: alwayes giuing the first place to them that are of Noble houses by Race.</P>
<P>For of all these three sorts, the French writers speake, when they say: <HI>Ily a difference des Nobles</HI>: 1. <HI>Les vns par race,</HI> 2. <HI>Les autres par annoblissement:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cuias de feud.</HI></NOTE> <HI>et deux sortes d' anno∣blissement: les vns sont annob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is par lettres deu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment verefies en la Cour de Parlement, les autres par <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e moyen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es offices dont ils sont pourueus.</HI> There is a difference of Nobles: The first, by Race: The second, by ennobling: and of Ennobling there are two sorts: One, by Patent duely prooued in the Court of Parliament: The other, by meanes of Offices to which they are aduanced.</P>

<Q><L>Resolue I cannot whether he,</L>

<P>Iust the same with that other verse of <HI>Homer.</HI> And our most worthy English,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir Philip Sydney.</HI></NOTE> not Poet (though he well de∣serue the title) but Captayne and Scholler, both excel∣lent, and titles which better become the noblenesse of his heart and house, of whome the world hath the good name, and all Soldiers the losse: he, I say, when hee would commend his Arcadian Gallant to the full, and yet in few words, sayth, that <HI>he durst and knew</HI>: which well symbolizeth with those former commendations of others, and compriseth all requisit vertues in a Gen∣tleman: for if he haue not valour to dare, and wisdome to know how and when, he wanteth one of the princi∣pall supporters of his honour.</P>
<P>The former of these, is, as it were, hereditary to ma∣ny Noble houses, &amp; continueth therein many descents; but the other is not naturall; it is gotten by studie and

exercise, by reading bookes, and seeing of Countries, and therein curiously obseruing what yee see. So then, if by this your trauell, you adde knowledge and vnder∣standing to that other vertue, which is hereditary to your house, you shall resemble those your Ance∣stors, by whome it hath beene raised to this greatnesse, and be most vnlike this French Nobilitie (that this may not seeme a digression) of whome, for the most part, we may say,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut.

<P>And sure, it is a lamentable case, or at least, misbesee∣ming, in a goodly Countrey, and full of Nobilitie, that the State should be gouerned, and all matters managed by them of the <HI>robbalonga,</HI> Aduocates and Procureurs, and Penne &amp; Inkehorne Gentlemen, and the Noblesse themselues for want of learning, not to haue imploy∣ment.

<P>The occasion of this French humour, so much to esteeme Armes, and nothing at all to regard learning, or it may be oftentimes to contemne both, is imputed

For, that propertie of slownesse, I must needes confesse, no way is due to the French.</P>
<P>He hath besides this libertie of speaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their hearke∣ning after▪ newes. Caesar.

<P>This vice of his, <HI>Caesar</HI> taxeth in another place, where he saith, <HI>Temeritas, quae maximè illi hominum generi con∣uenit, vt leuem auditionem habeant pro re comperta</HI>: It is a rashnesse familiar with that sort of people, to take a light heare-say, for an assured truth.</P>
<P>Concerning the French diet, it is, to keepe no diet: for they feede at all times,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their ma¦ner of Diet.</HI></NOTE> there being among them ve∣ry few, which besides their ordinary of dinner and sup∣per, do not <HI>gouster,</HI> as they call it, and make collations, three or foure times the day, a thing as vsuall with the women as men, whome ye shall see in open streetes be∣fore their dores, eate and drinke together.

<P>But wee may pay <HI>Commines</HI> with his owne coyne, and reply, that a Frenchman of all other (except the Dutch) hath least cause to taxe vs of drinking: for we may see by many of their noses, what pottage they loue; and they haue among them, a Prouerbe of their Priests (whom it worse beseemeth then a Soldier) when they will note a matter of difficulty, <HI>Il y a plus de difficulté, qu' a tirer vn Prestre de village de la Tauerne</HI>: Tis a har∣der matter, then to draw a Countrey Priest from the Tauerne.</P>

<P>The French fashion (as you see dayly) is to larde all meats, whose prouision ordinary is not so plentifull as ours, nor his table so well furnished: howbeit, in ban∣quets they farre exceed vs; for he is as <HI>friand</HI> (licourish) as the Trencher-men of <HI>Media,</HI> or <HI>Aesope</HI> the Tragedi∣an, who spent fifteene thousand Crownes at one feast, in the toungs of Birds onely.

<P>As for the poore <HI>Paisant,</HI> he fareth very hardly, and feedeth most vpon bread and fruits, but yet hee may comfort himselfe with this, that though his fare be no∣thing so good, as the ploughmans, and poore Artificers in England, yet is it much better then that of the <HI>villan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in Italy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Building.</HI></NOTE>Of the French building, I haue spoken before in the Relation of <HI>Paris,</HI> both that it is lately growne to bee more magnificent, then it was in former times, and that many thereby haue much weakened their e∣state.</P>
<P>You may therefore obserue, that as I there sayd, the City of <HI>Paris</HI> was better built then that of <HI>London</HI>: so are in generall, all the Cities and villages in France, fai∣rer then ours in England, comparing the one with the other: which the fairer they were, the more miserable spectacle doe they yeeld to vs now, to see them in many places defaced and ruined.</P>
<P>As for the maner of building heere, how beautifull soeuer it bee to the eye, the Offices and roomes, mee
<PB REF="76" MS="y"/>
thinks, are not so well contriued as ours, to the vse. One thing there is, by which they are much beautified, namely, the blewish kinde of Tyle, which heere they haue in great quantity, the which is very hard, and therefore durable; and very thinne and light, and there∣fore not so burthensome to a house, as is our Tyle in England.</P>
<P>Concerning the Frenchmans Apparell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Apparell.</HI></NOTE> if ye wel ob∣serue that of the Citizen, both men and women, it is very seemly and decent: that of the <HI>Paisant,</HI> very poore, all whose apparell for the most part, is of lynnen: As for that of the Noblesse, ye shall heare what <HI>La Nouë</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Les despenses de la Noblesse en leurs habits sont excessiues, &amp; fort riches:</HI> The Noblesse in their expence in apparell, are excessiue and very rich. And yet, mee thinkes, no∣thing so rich and costly as ours; the only excesse where∣of, is the greatest preiudice and hindrance to the Common wealth, and publike benefite of our coun∣trey.</P>
<P>This Authour reprooueth two things in the French apparrell. First, that euery Gallant forsooth, must haue many suits at once, and change often in the yeere: and therefore (sayth hee) if in the Court they spie one in a sute of the last yeres making, they scoffingly say,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nous le cognoissons bien, il ne nous mordra pas, c'est vn fruit suranné</HI>: We know him well enough, he wil not hurt vs, hee's an Apple of the last yeere.</P>
<P>The second thing he dislikes, is this, that <HI>De deux ans en deux ans les façons changent</HI>: Euery two yere the fashi∣on changeth. And heereof it commeth, that when ye see all other Nations paynted in the proper habit of their Countrey, the French man is alwayes pictured
<PB REF="77"/>
with a paire of sheeres in his hand, to signify, that hee hath no peculiar habit of his own, nor contenteth him∣selfe long with the habit of any other, but according to his cappriccious humour, deuiseth daily new fashions.</P>
<P>This variety of fashions a man may well note in the Fripperies of <HI>Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë.</HI></NOTE> whereof sayth <HI>la Nouë,</HI> if one would make a purtreict in a table, <HI>rien ne se pourrit voir plus plai∣sant</HI>: It would bee the most sportfull thing that may bee.</P>
<P>I am now by order to speake of his <HI>Exercises,</HI> where∣in,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their ex∣ercises.</HI></NOTE> me thinks, the Frenchman is very immoderate, espe∣cially in those which are somewhat violent; for ye may remember, ye haue seene them play Sets at Tennise in the heat of Summer, &amp; height of the day, when others were scarce able to stirre out of dores. This immode∣rate play in this vnseasonable time, together with their intemperate drinking and feeding, is the onely cause, that heere ye see them generally itchy &amp; scabbed, some of them in so foule a sort, as they are vnfit for any honest table.</P>
<P>Among all the exercises of France, I preferre none before the <HI>Palle-maille,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Palle-maille.</HI></NOTE> both because it is a Gentleman-like sport, not violent, and yeelds good occasion and opportunity of discourse, as they walke from the one marke to the other. I maruell, among many more A∣pish and foolish toyes, which wee haue brought out of France, that wee haue not brought this sport also into England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shooting in the Peece,</HI></NOTE>Concerning their shooting with the Crossebowe, it is vsed, but not very commonly. Once in a yere, there is in each city a shooting with the Peece at a Popingay of wood, set vpon some high steeple (as also they doe
<PB REF="77" MS="y"/>
in many places of Germany.) He that hitteth it downe, is called the King for that yere, and is free from all taxe: besides, he is allowed twenty crownes towards the ma∣king of a Collation for the rest of the shooters. And if it happen, that three yeres together he carry the Prize, he is free from all taxe and imposition whatsoeuer, all his life after.</P>
<P>This custome, no question, is very laudable, whose end tendeth much to a publike benefit: for by this prac∣tise and emulation, he groweth more ready and perfit in the vse of his Peece, and so more able and fit to do his Countrey seruice. And I suppose, if in times past wee had had like Prizes for the long Bow (the ancient glory of our English seruice) we had not so soone quit the ex∣ercise thereof, nor degenerate so farre from ancient cu∣stome. So doe I thinke, that in these dayes, wherein the Peece is onely prized, if wee had this fashion of France and Germany in England, to reward him in euery place that should best deserue therein, that our Countrey∣man would grow more perfit &amp; expert in the vse there∣of, at whose vnaptnesse and aukwardnesse in their first trayning, before they come to haue serued some time, I haue often maruayled.</P>
<P>He hath also his sports of bowling, carding, dicing, and other vnlawful, and vnvseful games, whereof I will omit to speake, being too common both with them and vs.</P>
<P>As for the exercise of Tennis play,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tennis Play.</HI></NOTE> which I aboue re∣membred, it is more here vsed, then in all Christendome besides; whereof may witnesse the infinite number of Tennis Courts throughout the land, insomuch as yee cannot finde that little <HI>Burgade,</HI> or towne in France, that
<PB REF="78"/>
hath not one or moe of them. Here are, as you see, three∣score in <HI>Orleans,</HI> and I know not how many hundred there be in <HI>Paris:</HI> but of this I am sure, that if there were in other places the like proportion, ye should haue two Tennis Courts, for euery one Church through France. Me thinks it is also strange, how apt they be here to play well, that ye would thinke they were borne with Rac∣kets in their hands, euen the children themselues ma∣nage them so well, and some of their women also, as we obserued at <HI>Blois.</HI></P>
<P>There is this one great abuse in this exercise, that the Magistrates do suffer euery poore Citizen, and Artifi∣cer to play thereat, who spendeth that on the Holyday, at Tennis, which hee got the whole weeke, for the kee∣ping of his poore family. A thing more hurtfull then our Ale-houses in England, though the one and the o∣ther be bad ynough. And of this I dare assure you, that of this sort of poore people, there be more Tennis Play∣ers in France, then Ale-drinkers, or Malt-wormes (as they call them) with vs.</P>
<P>You obserue here, that their Balles are of cloth, which fashion they haue held this seuen yeeres: before which time they were of lether, like ours. Much more might be said of this exercise, but I will not reade you a Lec∣ture in the Schoole of Tennis, whom I confesse the bet∣ter Scholler.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dancing.</HI></NOTE>Neither should I speake of Dancing (for my dancing dayes are done) to you that are a Master in the Arte: (like <HI>Phormio</HI> the Rhetoritian, to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> of the warres) saue onely, that I presume, yee will giue mee leaue, for methodes sake, hauing vndertaken to speake of the French exercises, not to omit that of Dauncing, where∣in
<PB REF="78" MS="y"/>
they most delight, and is most generally vsed of all o∣thers. And I am perswaded, were it not for this, that they of the Reformed Religion, may not Dance, being an exercise against which their strait-laced Ministers much inueigh, that there had long since many of the Catholikes turned to their side: so much are they all in generall addicted hereunto. For yee shall not onely see the <HI>Damoiselles</HI> (Gentlewomen) and them of the bet∣ter sort, but euery poore <HI>Chapperonnieze</HI> (draggletayle) e∣uen to the Coblers daughter, that can Dance with good measure, &amp; Arte, all your <HI>Quarantes, Leualties, Bransles,</HI> &amp; other Dances whatsoeuer: notsomuch but the <HI>Chambri∣ere</HI> (Chamber-maid) and poore Citizens wife, Dance v∣sually in the Citie streets, in a round, like our countrey lasses on their towne greene, about the May-pole, ma∣king musick of their own voices, without any instrumēt. And rather then faile, the old women themselues, both Gentle &amp; base, who haue moe toes then teeth, and these that are left, leaping in their heads, like Iacks in Virgi∣nals, will beare their part. This argueth (I will not say a lightnes &amp; immodesty in behauiour) but a stirring spi∣rit, &amp; liuelynesse in the French nature: whereof also the Musicke and songs they haue, is no small argument:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Musicke</HI></NOTE> For there is not almost a tune in all France, which is not <HI>Io∣nicke,</HI> or <HI>Lydian,</HI> of fiue or seuen tunes: a note forbid∣den youth by <HI>Plato,</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> because,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bod. l.</HI> 4. <HI>rep.</HI></NOTE> sayth <HI>Bo∣din,</HI> it hath <HI>Grande force et puissance d' amollir et lascher les caeurs des hommes:</HI> Great force and power to soften and effeminate mens minds. The tune <HI>Doricke,</HI> which is more graue musicke, and was commaunded for the singing of Psalmes in the Primitiue Church,

their inconstant and stirring humor cannot brooke by any meanes.</P>
<P>It remaineth, I speake of their <HI>Language,</HI> of whome the <HI>Italian</HI> hath a prouerbe:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their Language</HI></NOTE> <HI>I Francesi nen parlane, ceme scriuene, nen cantane, ceme netane, nen pensane, ceme dicene</HI>: The French neither pronounce as they write, nor sing as they pricke, nor thinke as they speake. In which first point, they differ from the <HI>Latine, Italian, Spanish, Greeke,</HI> who fully pronounce euery letter in the word: where∣as the French, to make his speech more smooth, and <HI>ceu∣lante</HI> (as hee termes it) leaues out very many of his con∣sonants, whereby it now is growne almost as sweete a tongue to the eare, as the <HI>Italian</HI> or <HI>Greeke</HI>: which two, by reason of the many vowels, are questionlesse the most delicate languages of the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Suetonius.</HI></NOTE>It is written of <HI>Augustus</HI> the Emperour, that he ob∣serued no Orthography, but wrote alwayes as he spake, which fashion begins now to be vsed by late writers: as ye may obserue in many of their late impressions: a thing vtterly condemned by them of best iudgement: for saith one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ludo.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. li.</HI> 3.</NOTE>Much agreeing with this, is that of <HI>Haillan,</HI> where
<PB REF="79"/>
speaking of the battell of <HI>Agincourt,</HI> he saith, <HI>Les Anglois nous ont souuent vaincuz en batailles, mais nous les auons vain∣cuz en nos traictez de paix: tant be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es et subtiles sont nos pa∣roles, et pleines de mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardises</HI>: The English haue often o∣uercome vs in battels, but wee haue ouercome them in our Treaties of peace, so faire and subtil are our words, and so full of entising delicacy. Whereby it should seeme, it is a winning and perswading language. But this is onely the opinion of themselues, who are dotingly more in loue with their owne tongue, then with any o∣ther: which is the reason, that yee haue now almost all Histories, Greeke, and Latine, translated into French, yea, and the Artes also: insomuch as now the Gentle∣man readeth these things in his owne language onely: a course in my opinion most preiudicial to all good lear∣ning.</P>
<P>There is one reason, me thinks, aboue all other, why the Frenchman affects to haue his tongue delicate and smooth, namely, for that rather then hee will lose the nigardise thereof, contrary to all rules of Grammar, and all other tongues, he obserueth no gender, where it may hinder the sweetnesse of the pronunciation (an Italian fault this, to take the Masculine for the Feminine: the more beast he.)</P>
<P>It remaineth (this French tongue being no Mother tongue of it self) that we obserue of what other tongues it borroweth. <HI>Caesar</HI> saith, <HI>Galli literis Graecis v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebantur</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caes.

<P><PB REF="80"/>Howsoeuer the letter be changed, true it is, that they haue heere many words deriued from the Greeke, and agree very much also therewith in the phrase and ma∣ner of speaking. And therefore, as <HI>Lu. Regius</HI> sayth well of our English,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lud. Re∣gius.</HI></NOTE> that it is compounded of the French &amp; Almaine: so iudgeth he rightly of the French, that it is the daughter of the Latine and Greeke: for, as for that which it hath common with the Italian, both in word and phrase (which is very much) the Italian, no questiō, had it from hence, this French being the more ancient Language: and this nation hauing left in Italy, with the memory of many great victories, the vse also of many of their words, as by all Historie appeareth, without which, at this day the Italian could not serue himself of his owne.</P>
<P>True it is, that now of late, the French, especially in the Court, haue gotten many of theirs in vse, for a grace forsooth, not of necessity; wherein they much resemble vs of England, who (they say) send diuers skinnes into other countries, which those people vse to their necessi∣ty, and make toyes and bables of the tayles, which they returne backe againe to vs, at as great a rate, as they bought the whole.</P>
<P>Concerning the difference betweene the language vsed at this day, and that of former times, ye are to ob∣serue, that all things in this world haue their begin∣nings, growings, perfection, corruption and alteration: As maners of liuing, formes of gouernment, abrogati∣on of Lawes, change of Militarie seruice, new-fangle∣nesse of habit, new fashion of building, diuersities of Armour, new inuentions of instruments, &amp;c. And of all these, none more subiect to change, then Language,
<PB REF="80"/>
nor no language in the world more then this of the French.</P>
<P>For as <HI>Polibius</HI> sayeth of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> that when they should conclude a Peace, after the second <HI>Punicke</HI> warre with them of <HI>Carthage,</HI> that they could not reade the Articles of the first, so much was the Character: And as <HI>Liuie</HI> saith of the song which the <HI>Sabin</HI> Priestes vsed in their sacrifice, that they were so olde Latine, they could not be vnderstoode: And as wee may say of our <HI>English,</HI> that it very much differeth from that of <HI>Chaucers</HI> time: so saith <HI>Lu.

<P>If you aske me what Authours of the French I most approoue?

And in another place, <HI>Cum intelligeret Caesar omnes fere Gallos nouis rebus studere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caes.

<P>To conclude, if yee will rightly knowe the nature &amp; humor of the ancient <HI>Gaules,</HI> ye must read the sixt of these Commentaries, and you shal obserue how strange it is, that though all other things in the world are sub∣iect to change, yet the same <HI>naturel</HI> of lightnesse and in∣constancy still remaines in the French. This is aptly shewed by <HI>Haillan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haill. li.</HI> 3.</NOTE> in his description of <HI>Lewes</HI> the ele∣uenth: <HI>Auoit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l vne chose? soudain ill auoit affection d' vne autre: estaut vehement, actif et impatient:</HI> If hee had one thing, hee straight casts his affection to another, being
<PB REF="81"/>
violent, busy-headed and impatient.</P>
<P>To this accordeth another of their owne writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>In matter of warre. Com. cap.</HI> 44.</NOTE> <HI>La condition de la France est telle, que s' il n' y a debat par de∣hors contre les grands, il faut qu' ell' eust auec ses domesticques, et que son esprit ne peut estre en repos</HI>: Such is the condition of France, that if shee haue no Warres abroad against powerfull neighbours, shee must haue broyles at home among her owne Subiects, and her working spirits can neuer remaine long quiet. And therefore <HI>Tacitus</HI> calles them, <HI>Leuissima hominum genera</HI>: The most fickle kinde of men; sudden to begin and more sudden to ende, ap∣ter to apprehend the action, then comprehend the cause, ready to lay hold, not able to hold fast: as by the making and reuoking of so many Edicts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dern. troub. Guicciard lib.</HI> 5.</NOTE> against the <HI>Re∣formed Religion</HI> in so fewe yeeres, by the winning and losing of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Millaine</HI> in so short time, and by many other their actions appeareth.</P>
<P>For yee must obserue of the French, that he entreth a Countrie like thunder, and vanisheth out againe like smoke: hee resembleth the Waspe, who after the first stroke, loseth her sting, and can hurt no more.</P>
<P>He sheweth this his lightnesse and inconstancie, not onely in matters of seruice and warre, (whereof I haue before made mention) but also euen in other his actions and carriages: But in nothing more, then in his fami∣liaritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. <HI>In in∣tertay∣ning of friendship</HI></NOTE> with whome a stranger cannot so soone bee off his horse, but he will be acquainted; nor so soone in his Chamber, but the other like an Ape will bee on his shoulder: and as suddenly and without cause yee shall lose him also. A childish humour, to bee wonne with as little as an Apple, and lost with lesse then a Nut: Quite contrarie to the nature of the <HI>Italian,</HI> of whome
<PB REF="82"/>
yee shall in your trauell shortly obserue, that he is of too sullen and retired a fashion, &amp; a <HI>loup-garou</HI> (as the French man calles him) wherein I would haue you obserue the vertue of the English man (for vertue is a mediocrity betweene two extremes) who is neyther so childishly and Apishly familiar, as the French; nor so scornefully and Cynically solitary as the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4. <HI>In ma∣naging a quarrell.</HI></NOTE>So are we in matter of duell and priuate quarrell, in a meane, me thinks, betweene these two Nations: for we are neither so deuillishly mindfull of reuenge, as to tar∣ry seuen or ten yeres for an opportunity vpon our ene∣my, as doeth the Italian: nor so inconsideratly hasty, as we must needs eyther fight to day, or be friends to mor∣row, as doth the French. Hereat <HI>Rablais</HI> scoffingly glan∣ceth, where he telleth a tale of a <HI>Gascoigne,</HI> that hauing lost his money, would needs in the heat of his choller fight with any man that bore head: and for want of an enemy fell asleepe. By that time he was waking, comes mee another <HI>Rhodomonte,</HI> and vpon like cause of losse, would haue this fellow by the eares: but then the edge of this other was off. In conclusion (sayth <HI>Rablais</HI>) they went both to the Tauerne, and there for want of mo∣ney which they had lost at Dice, drunke themselues friends vpon their swords, without farther medi∣ation, or troubling of others to take vp the quarrell.</P>
<P>Of the French carriage and manage of a quarrell, how childish and ridiculous it is, ye haue already seene two or three examples, wherein the parties haue ney∣ther shewed iudgement, to know their owne right, nor valor to reuenge their wrong: whereas the English Gentleman, with mature deliberation disputeth how farre his honour is ingaged, by the iniury offered,
<PB REF="82"/>
and iudiciously determineth his maner of satisfaction, according to the quality of the offence: which done, hee presently embarqueth himselfe into the action, ac∣cording to the prescription of the olde rule, <HI>Postquam consulueris, maturè opus est facto</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salust.</HI></NOTE> Wise resolutions should be speedily executed.</P>
<P>I will heere remember you of one other instance more, wherein our Countreymen keepe the golden meane, betweene the two extremes of defect and ex∣cesse, and wherein these two Nations of Italy and France are culpable, and heere worthily to be taxed.</P>
<P>We may say of the Italian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. <HI>In Go∣uerning his wife. Plut. Themist.</HI></NOTE> who maketh his house his wiues prison, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> sayth of the Persians, <HI>Sont de nature estrangement &amp; cruellement ialouzes des femmes, non seulement de celles qu'ils ont espousées, mais aussi de leurs es∣claues: &amp; de leurs concubines, lesquelles ils gardent si estroit∣tement que personne ne les void iamais dehors, ains demeurent tousiours renfermées en leurs maisons</HI>: They are by nature strangely and cruelly iealous of their women, not onely of their wiues, but also of their slaues and Concubines, whom they gard so straitly, that they are neuer seene a∣broad, but remayne alwayes locked vp in their houses: Whereas the French liberty on the other side is too much: for here a man hath many occasions offred vp∣on any small entrance, to come acquainted; and vpon euery least acquaintance, to enter, where he may come to her house, accōpany her arme in arme in the streets, court her in all places, &amp; at all seasons, without imputa∣tion. Wherein, me thinks, the French maried man doth as <HI>Plutarch</HI> reports of <HI>Pericles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. Pericl.</HI></NOTE> <HI>take away the walles &amp; fen∣ces of his orchards &amp; gardens, to th'end euery man might freely enter and gather fruit at his pleasure.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="83"/>No maruell then, the bridle being left in their owne hands, though sometimes they be saddled, &amp; their hus∣bands know not. You may obserue therefore, that in this matter of wedlocke also, the English vse is better then either the Italian or French.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6. <HI>In apt∣nesse to scoffe.</HI></NOTE>It is also naturall to the French, to be a great scoffer; for men of light and vnsteadie braines, haue common∣ly sudden and sharpe conceites. Hereto also their lan∣guage well agreeth, as being currant and full of pro∣uerbes; to which purpose I will remember you of two answeres, not long since made by two Frenchmen, with one of which you are well acquainted, wherein also you may obserue, how little esteeme they hold of the <HI>Romane</HI> Religion in heart, though they make pro∣fession thereof in shew.</P>
<P>The one of these being very sicke, &amp;, as was thought, in danger of death, his ghostly father comes to him with his <HI>Corpus domini,</HI> and tels him, that hearing of the extremitie wherein he was, he had brought him his <HI>Sa∣uiour,</HI> to comfort him before his departure. The sicke Gentleman withdrawing the Curtaine, and seeing there the fat lubberly Frier with the <HI>Oast</HI> in his hand, answereth, I know it is our <HI>Sauiour</HI>; he comes to me as he went to Ierusalem, <HI>C' est vn asne qui le porte:</HI> He is carried by an Asse.</P>
<P>The other Gentleman vpon like danger of sicknesse, hauing the Frier come to him to instruct him in the Faith, and after, to giue him the <HI>Oast,</HI> and then the ex∣treme vnction (it was on a Friday) tolde him that hee must beleeue, that this <HI>Corpus domini</HI> which he brought, was the very reall flesh, blood and bone of our Saui∣our. Which after the sicke man had freely confessed, the
<PB REF="83"/>
Frier offered it him to receyue for his comfort. Nay, quoth the other, <HI>Vous m'excuseré, car ie ne mange point de chair le vendredi</HI>: You shall excuse me, for I eate no flesh on Fridayes. So that yee see the French will rather lose his god, then his good iest.</P>
<P>The French humour also (sayth one) <HI>est incompatible auec patience &amp; modestie</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bolde.</HI></NOTE> cannot away with patience &amp; modesty. And therefore another sayth of him, that he is as shamefast and modest, <HI>comme vn Page de la Cour</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë. Plut. Alcib.</HI></NOTE> as a Page of the Court. Or as <HI>Hiperbolus,</HI> who, <HI>Plutarch</HI> saith, for his boldnesse and saucy impudency, was the only Subiect in his time for all Satyricks and Comme∣dians to worke vpon.</P>
<P>He is also such a one, as <HI>Theophrastus</HI> calles, <HI>Duscherès,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vncleanly Theoph.

This is hee that comes to the Tennis Court, throwes his P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse full of coyne at the line, which giueth a sound, as if there were no lesse then thirtie or fourtie Crownes, when as sometimes by mischance, we haue discouered that it was nothing, but Paper, and a fewe Sols, and doubles of Brasse, that made it so swell, in all, scarce eighteene pence sterling.</P>

Such a one was the gallant, of whome yee tolde me this other day, who in the middest of his discourse with you and other Gen∣tlemen, suddenly turnes backe to his Lackie, Fetch me, saith he, my <HI>Horologe,</HI> Clocke, it lies in my lodging in such or such a place, neere such or such a Iewell.

To speake thus particularly of all his seuerall humours and customes, would bee very prolixe, and not much necessarie: I wil only referre you to the fourth of <HI>Tullies Rhetorickes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rhet. ad Herren.

<P>I will onely speake of his impatience and precipitati∣on in deliberations of Warre or Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hastie to conclude a Peace.</HI></NOTE> and such other

affayres of greatest importance, and so end. To this ef∣fect <HI>Bodin</HI> saith of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 5</NOTE> <HI>Le naturel du François est si soudain &amp; actif, qu'il quitte ce qu'on demande, annuyé des allées &amp; ve∣nuës, &amp; de longueurs propres à l' Espagnol</HI>: The French is of so sudden &amp; busy a disposition, that he quickly yeelds to that a man demands, being soone tired with messages to &amp; fro, and other delayes peculiar to the Spanyard.

<P><PB REF="85"/>By this haste of theirs, they lost more, saith <HI>Bodin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. l.</HI> 5.</NOTE> by one Treatie at <HI>Cambrey,</HI> Anno 1559. to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> then he had before got of the <HI>French</HI> in fortie yeeres by Warre.</P>
<P>And I see no reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of this peace of Fra. and Sp. in</HI> 98.</NOTE> but this present Peace which the <HI>French</HI> hath made, is as aduātageous to the <HI>Spanish</HI> State, as was that other, considering <HI>it is as great a gaine to saue that we are like to lose, as to get that from another, which is not our owne.</HI> For as it is truely said of the Spanish King, that hee hath not got vpon the French (money by victories, but victories by money:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut.

<Q><L>Our State, which witlesse force made wayne,</L>

<P>For that this nation will rather yeeld the enemie what he demandeth, then bee troubled with long deliberati∣on: a thing so contrarie to his nature, as nothing more.</P>
<P>You may obserue by the course of later Histories, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> purpose was to deale with France,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. Alcib.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Al∣cibiades</HI> said, the <HI>Athenians</HI> would deale by them of <HI>Pa∣trae</HI>: They will eate you out by litle and little. To which purpose, in all these late ciuill Warres, King <HI>Philip</HI> play∣ed the Fire-brand, like the Priests of <HI>Mars,</HI> who,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin l.</HI> 4.</NOTE> when two Armies were met, threw fire betweene them for a signall of battell, to set them together, and then retired themselues from the danger. He set the <HI>Popes</HI> on also to kindle this fire, who were but Barkers, and could not bite; their leaden Buls did but butt; they could not hurt;
<PB REF="86"/>
abler to curse then to kill: whose force is like that of a Whet-stone,
<Q><L>Which though it sharpnesse lacke,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. Peri.</NOTE>Yet yron sharpe can make.</L></Q></P>
<P>But when hee saw that little England (which is to Spaine, as <HI>Alcibiades</HI> said, the Ile Aegina was to Athens, <HI>Vne paille en l'ail,</HI> a mote in his eye) did trump in his way, and crosse his dessignes: and when as hee considered, that (as <HI>Henry</HI> the second of France, was the only cause of hindering his father <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, from vsurping vp∣on all <HI>Germanie,</HI> for which cause hee is called in their publike writings, <HI>The Protector of the Empire, and deliuerer of the Princes:</HI>) So her Maiestie, by defending the oppres∣sed, and withstanding his Forces, deserueth the Title of <HI>Protectrix of France, and deliuerer of the Estates</HI>: Hee was then content to motion a Peace, and like a false friend, when he could doe no more hurt, to shake hands. Here∣vpon he did capitulate to render <HI>Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, Durlens, Ardres, Blauet,</HI> and other places conquered or surprised vpon the French. A course, no question, wisely taken by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> considering the termes wherein hee stoode; the want of money hee had, the credit hee had lost in all Bankes, the decrepit age wherein he was, and lastly, the sudden and incredible good fortunes of the French King and State, after so many yeres of miserie and losse. As for the French, what could he haue done, more dis∣honourable to himselfe, or profitable to his enemies, or preiudiciall to his late Allies? what lesse agreeing with the time, with his cause, with his oath, then to yeeld to this peace? But it hath bene an old tricke of the French, to obserue neither promise, nor oath, as <HI>Clouis</HI> the first saith, <HI>Haill. lib.</HI> 1. Wee may say of their purpose, as

<HI>Plutarch</HI> of <HI>Lisanders: Children are deceiued with chance▪</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut.

But let the French take heede there come not a day of payment for this, who are so hastie to abandon their friends, and make peace with their foes, onely vpon a foolish <HI>naturel</HI> of theirs, to desire change, and to enioy their present ease and pleasure, not foreseeing future daungers: like Schoole-boyes, who care not, so they may play to day, though they be britcht to morrow. When the Dukes of <HI>Burgondie, Berrie,</HI> and <HI>Bretaine,</HI> were combined a∣gainst <HI>Lewes</HI> the 11. of France (as were lately England, France, and States against Spaine) the counsell of <HI>Fran∣cis Zforce</HI> to the King, was, for the present, to agree to all things they desired, and after (saith hee) in short time, ye shall haue occasion when they are disleagued, to deale with them one by one. And we may well say of this King present,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commines cap.</HI> 24.</NOTE> as the Count <HI>Charollois</HI> feared of the Duke of <HI>Berrie</HI> the French Kings brother: That he was a likely man to be soone drawen to agree, &amp; leaue vs in the mire: forgetting the olde sentence:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI></NOTE> It is the true signe of the approching ruine of a Countrey, when those that should holde together, diuide them∣selues, and abandon one another.

It is true therefore, that <HI>Commines</HI> saith, There was neuer so plentifull a mariage feast, but some went without their dinners. Wherein, me thinks, we haue great wrong, to beare a burden with them in their
<PB REF="87"/>
Warres, and not to partake with them in the benefit of their Peace. <HI>Maximilian</HI> the first Emperour said, hee made Peace for no other end with <HI>Lewes</HI> the twelfth, but to be reuenged of seuenteene wrongs he had done him. The King present, by the policie of this age, and law <HI>Talionis,</HI> might say and doe the like to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> not for seuenteene wrongs, but for seuenteene yeeres wrongs hee hath receiued: which when hee shall haue done, it is but quittance, and the other shall be but iust∣ly serued:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bod. lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> for saith <HI>Bodin, He which is falsly dealt with, ha∣uing himselfe first played false, hath no cause to complaine.</HI> And surely, the French must againe shortly bee doing, with him or some other, or at least one with another at home: he will soone be as wearie of Peace, as he is now of warre.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Nouë</HI></NOTE> <HI>La nation Françoise est insolent en pain, impatiente de demurer long temps en la maison</HI>: The French nation is insolent in Peace, &amp; impatient of tarrying long at home.</P>
