<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I first resolved to publish these Pa∣pers, I could not be long in suspense to whom to Dedi∣cate them: They contain a short Account of our Own <HI>British Island,</HI> and I know not better at whose Feet chiefly to prostrate them, than where I found the brave, old, he∣roick, <HI>English</HI> Spirit most eminent∣ly Predominant.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>'Tis the unhappy <HI>Genius</HI> of some Grandees in this Age to affect no∣thing, but what either appears in a Foreign Dress, or comes fraught with new and unheard-of Rarities from abroad, as if our <HI>English</HI> Soil was so barren in its Productions, that it could not afford any thing to divert the Curious; or it was altogether not worth the while to Contemplate herein the wonderful Works of Nature, because they are nearer to our own Doors.</P>
<P>And yet, as it is not very easie to discover many other Countries, where Nature hath been more dif∣fusive of her choisest Blessings than in our Own; so likewise to point out any one Place, where she hath beeen more liberal in dispersing va∣rious and delightful Objects, than within the Confines of this flourish∣ing Monarchy, a Scheme of which I take here the boldness to present to your Honour.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>Upon which account I could have wish'd that I had Pourtray'd the Features in a more exact con∣formity to the first Lineaments of Nature; but however it may mis∣carry in the Draught, perhaps there may be something which may not prove altogether Indivertive, when your vacant Hours from greater and more important Affairs in the Government, in one of the highest Orbs of which Your experienc'd Wisdom and Integrity have most deservedly placed You, will give You leave to cast some few glances on it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I confess I ought justly to Apo∣logize for prefixing Your Great Name before so mean a Trifle, whose late signal Service to the An∣cient and Worthy Corporation and Port of <HI>Dover,</HI> will alone perpetuate it to succeeding Generations.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>But when again I consider Your great Candour and Goodness, Your generous Temper and obliging De∣portment, with which You are wont to Proselyte all who have the Honour of Your Acquaintance, I am apt to Flatter my self, that You will please to Pardon this bold Ad∣dress, and look upon it only, as in∣deed it is, a sincere Testimony for me, how ready and officious I am to express my Gratitude for the manifold Favours conferr'd upon,</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT will not, I presume, be thought a∣miss to acquaint the Reader, that these Papers had in all probability lain long buried in Dust and Obscurity, had not some false Copies, which by chance came lately to the true Author's notice, stole Clandestinely into the World under the specious Title of Mr. <HI>Roger's Three Years Travels over</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Wales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are indeed so unadvisedly patch'd toge∣ther, so wretchedly Curtail'd, so horribly Im∣perfect, and abominably Erroneous, that the right Author was obliged in his own Vin∣dication to publish from his own true Ma∣nuscript, which hath been formerly, and of late, perused by the Hands of some Learn∣ed Men, a more Authentick Copy. And though he cannot as yet discover this my∣sterious
<PB REF="5"/>
Cheat, which has for some time walked in Darkness, yet to discourage for the future all such unbecoming mercenary Attempts, he resolved at last with himself, by a more correct Edition, to expose the Plagiarism and Dishonesty of such vile Pul∣troons, and scandalous Undertakers, which have appeared with such open and brazen∣faced Effrontery.</P>
<P>And though indeed they have put on what false Disguise they can to Cheat the World, and set off the Book with the most plausible Varnishes, that thereby they might the better recommend it to the Reader, yet there doth appear throughout the whole Series of it such horrible Blunders, and im∣pardonable Mistakes, such silly Shiftings and Turnings both of Things and Places, such crude Apologies for its Brevity, and in short, such a shameful Contexture of Ig∣norance and Impudence closely link'd toge∣ther by that unlearned Fry. To give but one notorious Instance here for all, their placing, <HI>Page 99.</HI> the Seven Wonders of the <HI>Peak</HI> in <HI>Lancashire</HI> instead of <HI>Darby∣shire;</HI> though there are divers other as gross Errours, if it be worth while to rake into them, as their false Transcribing or leaving out quite divers proper Names of great Significancy; as also what chiefly re∣lated to the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, that as such un∣comely
<PB REF="5"/>
Features will easily discover the Spu∣riousness of the Brood, so no Pen can be sharp enough to expose the Disingenuity and Baseness of such a viperous Genera∣tion.</P>
<P>Now such a seasonable Advertisement as this is, being sufficient to caution the un∣wary Reader against all other previous Edi∣tions, will become as just an Apology for the present Publication of these ensuing Papers, which if so useful and diverting (as the World is told) under a false Vizor, will now prove, it is to be hoped, more pleasing and acceptable in their own true, native Co∣lours.</P>
<P>For they will here meet with a more full and accurate Description, though not of every individual Town and Place of Note within the Dominions of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> yet with a true and impartial Account of most Cities and Towns Corporate, with their famous Cathedrals and other eminent Stru∣ctures; of the most remarkable Havens and Rivers, of divers curious Caves, Wells and Mines, with many other divertive Pas∣sages, and historical Relations, with seve∣ral ancient Inscriptions, Epitaphs and Ob∣servations, which were yet never taken no∣tice of by any <HI>English</HI> Topographer, which be∣ing some Years ago Penned for the use of Two Young Gentlemen, Sons to Mr. <HI>Van-Acker,</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>
formerly an eminent Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> whom the Author had the happiness to ac∣company in these Travels, is now again Re∣vised to make it the more consummate and inviting.</P>
<P>So that whosoever is disposed to Travel Abroad, or to see, which indeed is most necessary first, and acquaint himself with the Rarities of Nature at Home, may know hereby in what Parts of our Island to find them; and for those who having already vi∣sited remoter Regions, are so strangely en∣ravished with the prospect of Foreign Va∣rieties, that they are hardly brought to be∣lieve any thing in their own Native Soil equal to such Discoveries as they have made in other Countries; this may be sufficient to inform them, That there is not any thing worth our Wonder Abroad, whereof Nature hath not written a Copy in our own Island: And it cannot be too frequently observed, that as <HI>Italy</HI> has <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Grotto, and the <HI>Sybil</HI>'s Cave by <HI>Puteoli,</HI> so <HI>England</HI> hath <HI>Ochy-Hole</HI> by <HI>Wells,</HI> and <HI>Pool</HI>'s by <HI>Bux¦ton</HI>: We have <HI>Baiae</HI> at the <HI>Bath,</HI> the <HI>Alps</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> the <HI>Spaw</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire, As∣phaltites</HI> at <HI>Pitchford</HI> in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> the <HI>Pyramids</HI> at <HI>Stonehenge,</HI> Pearls of <HI>Per∣sia</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and Diamonds of <HI>India</HI> at St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock. Besides, we have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of ancient and famous Castles and
<PB REF="6"/>
Garrisons, Fortresses and Bulwarks, Ram∣pires and Trenches; where as great Sieges have been made, as remarkable Battels fought, and as noble Atchievements per∣formed as in any other Places in <HI>Europe,</HI> which have been eminent for the Seats of War; to which if we add divers <HI>Roman</HI> High-ways and Causeys, with various Coins and Medals of great Antiquity, variously dispersed about the Kingdom, it will not stoop to any neighbouring Nation for such admirable Curiosities.</P>
<P>So that since <HI>England</HI> is not destitute of those many taking Things, which all Travel∣lers so passionately admire Abroad, it is very incongruous to pretend to be acquaint∣ed with other Countries, and to be Strangers to their own, which is an Epitome of all other; and which upon all these, as well as other Accounts, may very justly claim and challenge, as a due Debt, all those glorious Elogies which both Ancient and Modern Writers have conferred upon it.</P>
<P>And having thus briefly declar'd the main Design and Scope of this Narrative, I shall neither Complement my Reader into its ac∣ceptance, nor trouble my self to make any Harangue in Apologizing for its Contri∣vance; for as for all Candid Persons, I que∣stion not but their Censures will be as favour∣able as their Humours ingenuous: And as
<PB REF="7"/>
for such snarling Criticks, and carping <HI>Mo∣mus</HI>'s of the Age, who can sooner find a Fault than mend it, I am sure most comple∣mental Apologies will never work in them Candour or good Nature; I shall therefore endeavour to Arm my self against all their Cavils, with the excellent Advice of the wise Moralist <HI>Mimnermus,</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q></P>
<P>In English thus,
<Q><L>Attempt brave things, then set your Heart at rest,</L>
<L>Let not the sensless Mob disturb your Breast:</L>
<L>If some speak ill on purpose for to teaze you,</L>
<L>Others will speak the best, and let that please you.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF Mr. <HI>BROME'S</HI> Three Years TRAVELS OVER <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>A Narrative of his first Journey.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the Spring had rendred the Roads passable, and the Country was a fit∣ting Entertainment for Travellers, the Gentlemen, whose Names I have given my self the Honour of Inserting in the Title, were pleased to take me for their Compa∣nion, in order to have a View of those Places, which were under the same Government with the City from whence they set out, and which it was
<PB REF="8"/>
not Improper to be acquainted with before they made a Visit to Nations more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote. And since it is but natural for the Inhabitants of other Coun∣tries to be as inquisitive after our Scituation and Establishment, as we are after Theirs; we could not but endeavour to provide our selves with an <HI>Answer,</HI> by the Knowledge of our own Country's Constitution, before we had occasion to ask <HI>Que∣stons</HI> in Relation to those of others.</P>
<P>As these were the Reasons which occasion'd our Journey, so we took a time in which it was agree∣able to make one. The Season of the year push'd us forward, and the delights which it afforded were motives enough to persuade us to take leave of the Glorious City of <HI>London,</HI> which is <HI>Caput Gentis,</HI> and an Epitome of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Middle∣sex.</NOTE>We took our Journey through <HI>Middlesex,</HI> a Country famous for its goodly Edifices, as well wisely compacted together upon the pleasant Banks of <HI>Thames</HI>; as likewise for divers stately and magni∣ficent Palaces dispersed in several other parts there∣of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uxbridge</NOTE> to <HI>Ʋxbridge,</HI> anciently <HI>Woxbridge,</HI> seated on the <HI>Colne,</HI> which parts it from <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> a Town Built of late times, well stored with Inns, and of a considerable length. This was the place famous in the Year 1644. for a Treaty held be∣twixt King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and the Parliament, where after several Debates by Commissioners on both sides, the Treaty of Peace was unhappily broken off, and ended in a Deluge of Blood, which speedily over-ran this whole Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucks.</NOTE>From <HI>Ʋxbridge,</HI> we came into the County of <HI>Bucks,</HI> which might possibly receive its Denomi∣nation from its Fertility in Beech-Trees, there being a Province in <HI>Germany</HI> called <HI>Buchonia</HI> for that very reason: 'Tis a Country rich in Pasture, and so convenient for Grazing, that the Inhabi∣tants thereof do very much addict themselves to that Employment, receiving great Advantages by
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
the Vicinity of <HI>London,</HI> where the Markets are very Encouraging, the Prices being high, and the Returns considerable.</P>
<P>Passing through <HI>Beconsfield,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Becons∣field <HI>and</HI> Wickam.</NOTE> a Town better known, in that it was formerly part of the Inheri∣tance belonging to the Noble Family of the <HI>Schu∣damore</HI>'s, than for any thing at present of greater Consequence, we arrived at <HI>Wickam</HI> or <HI>Wicomb,</HI> situated above a pleasant Valley, by which runs along a little Rivolet, and perhaps from this situ∣ation it took its Name; for <HI>Combe,</HI> saith the Great Antiquary Mr. <HI>Somner,</HI> in his Saxon Dictionary, is a Valley enclosed on either side with Hills; and <HI>Wick,</HI> saith the same Author, is the turning, win∣ding, or hollowness of Water-banks, or the cur∣ving reach of a River: 'Tis a Town for large∣ness and buildings, not much inferiour to any throughout the Shire; and hath a Mayor and Al∣dermen to govern and support it; and is a place very much celebrated for the abundance of Bone-Lace usually made here, which brings no small Advantage and Profit to its Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Having refresh'd our selves a while here, we set forward for <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxford∣shire.</NOTE> which being once entred into, we could not sufficiently enough admire the pleasantness of the Soil; for there it is that <HI>Ceres</HI> bestows her Gifts most liberally upon the laborious Husbandman; there it is the Meadows are garni∣shed with <HI>Flora</HI>'s curious Embellishments; and the great variety of Plants allure and invite the indu∣strious Herbalist into a more strict Enquiry of their Names, Natures, and Properties: There it is where the Hills adorned with shady Woods, af∣ford most delightsome Bowers to wearied Students, whilst the Silver-stream'd Rivers with their gentle Murmurs nimbly coursing along by the humble Valleys, do whet their Fancies, and scrue up their Inventions to the highest pitch. To confer upon them suitable Encomiums; What more plea∣sant than <HI>Isis,</HI> afterward called <HI>Thamisis,</HI> which
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
runs along the South-side, and then branching it self out in several Veins gives heart to the Ea∣stern part of the County, till by a continued Cir∣culation like that of the Blood, after several Win∣dings, and Maeandrous Flexures, it lodgeth at last again within it self? What can be more diverting than the River <HI>Cherwell,</HI> which being well reple∣nished with numerous Shoals of Fish, after it hath for a time parted this County from <HI>Northampton∣shire,</HI> passeth through the midst of it, and divides it as it were into two equal Portions? In fine, Na∣ture hath here so generously scatter'd all her Lar∣gesses, either for Pleasure or Profit, that she cer∣tainly at first designed it as a Glorious Seat for the Muses, and a fruitful Colony for <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Chil∣dren; and therefore we now find here one of the Eyes of this Nation, which is the Renowned <HI>Ox∣ford.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxford.</NOTE><HI>Oxford,</HI> q. <HI>Bovis Vadum,</HI> a Ford for Oxen to pass over, as the <HI>Thracian Bosphorus</HI> is called by the Germans <HI>Ochenfurt.</HI> It was anciently called <HI>Bello∣situm</HI> for its healthy Air, and commodious Situ∣ation betwixt two Rivers, and is so ancient a City as to fetch its Original from the time of the <HI>Bri∣taine,</HI> so large, to contain 13 Parish Churches, besides the Cathedral so well adorned with private goodly Structures, as well as with divers magni∣ficent Colleges and Halls, that it must needs be al∣lowed to be one of the most beautiful and stately Cities in <HI>England:</HI> it is supposed by Antiquaries, to have been a place for publick Studies before the Reign of that learned Saxon King <HI>Alfred,</HI> who very much augmented it out of his Princely Favour, and Love to Learning and Religion, and it justly glories in the Ancient and Royal Foundation of <HI>Ʋniversity</HI>-College, founded by the aforesaid King <HI>Alfred,</HI> about the year 872.; afterward re-edified by <HI>William</HI> Archdeacon of <HI>Durham,</HI> or as others write, by <HI>William,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour; In the curious
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
Fabrick of <HI>New</HI>-College, built by <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> in <HI>Richard</HI> II's time; In the Magnificence of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> e∣rected by Cardinal <HI>Woolsey,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and in Twenty two stately Colleges and Halls besides. To wave the curious Fabrick of the Schools, the admirable Structure of the <HI>Theatre,</HI> built at the sole Cost and Charges of the most Re∣verend Father in God, <HI>Gilbert,</HI> late Lord Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>; the famous <HI>Bodleian</HI> Libra∣ry, which for a Collection of choice Books, and rare Manuscripts is not much inferiour to that of the <HI>Vatican</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> The <HI>Musaeum</HI> erected at the Charge of the University, for the Improvement of Experimental Knowledge: The publick Physick Garden, replenished with the choicest Plants, and surrounded with a strong Stone-Wall, at the Ex∣pence of his Grace the present Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> to∣gether with all the Customs, Privileges, Offices, and Dignities, which are already Elegantly set forth by the Ingenious Author of the <HI>Present State of England:</HI> I shall only observe, that the most Puissant King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. erected here first a Bi∣shop's See, and Endowed it, as we are informed, out of the Lands belonging to the dissolved Mo∣nasteries of <HI>Abington</HI> and <HI>Osney</HI>; and for further Ornaments to the University, and Encouragement of Learning, through the Munificence of that Prince, and divers other Benefactors, there have been since added divers professors of several Arts and Sciences, to instruct the younger Pupils in their Minority, and to make them fit Instruments for the Service of Church and State.</P>
<P>From hence we moved forward to <HI>Burford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burford.</NOTE> a Town in this County of good Note for its Anti∣quity, situated very pleasantly on the side of a rising Hill: It was formerly called <HI>Berghford,</HI> or <HI>Bregforde,</HI> saith my Learned Friend, Mr. <HI>White Kennet,</HI> in his Parochial Antiquities of <HI>Oxford∣shire</HI>; and as he further informs us, A Synod was
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
here Convened, at which were present the two Kings <HI>Etheldred</HI> and <HI>Berthwald, Theodore,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury, Sexwolph,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Litch∣field, Bosel,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and <HI>Aldhelm,</HI> af∣terward Bishop of <HI>Sherborn,</HI> then only Priest and Abbot of <HI>Malmsbury</HI>; which said <HI>Aldhelm,</HI> at the Command of this Synod, wrote a Book against the Errour of the <HI>British</HI> Christians, in the Obser∣vation of <HI>Easter,</HI> and other different Rites where∣in they disturbed the Peace of the Church; the reading of which Book reclaim'd many of those <HI>Britains</HI> who were under the West-<HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>After this, 'tis storied further, That about the year 752. <HI>Cuthred</HI> King of the West-<HI>Saxons,</HI> when he was no longer able to bear the Severe Tributes, and Exactions of <HI>Aethelbald,</HI> King of the <HI>Merci∣ans,</HI> who did most cruelly oppress him, and began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suck the very Blood and Marrow of his Sub∣jects, came into the Field against him, and in a pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d Battle at <HI>Beorgford,</HI> saith the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chro∣nicle, published by the Learned Mr. <HI>Gibson,</HI> rou∣ted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tally, taking from him his Banners, on which was painted a golden Dragon, and so eased and freed himself and his Subjects from that Tri∣butary Vassalage: The Memory whereof has con∣tinued for several Ages in the Custom used here of making a Dragon, and carrying it about the Town solemnly on <HI>Midsummer</HI>-Eve, with the ad∣dition of a Giant to it; the reason of which lat∣ter Practice is not so easily discovered, saith the Ingenious Dr. <HI>Plot,</HI> in his Natural History of <HI>Ox∣fordshire.</HI></P>
<P>Having once passed from this place, we soon arrived within the Limits of <HI>Glocestershire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glocester∣shire.</NOTE> in the Eastern parts swelled up into Hills, called <HI>Cots∣wold,</HI> which Feed innumerable Flocks of Sheep, the Wool whereof is much praised for its fineness; the middle parts consist of a fertile Plain, watered by the <HI>Severn</HI>: and the Western part, where lies the Forest of <HI>Dean,</HI> is much covered with Woods:
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
'Tis a Country happy in the Enjoyment of all things that are necessary for the Use and Service of Man; the very Lanes and Hedges being well-lined with Apple, and Pear-Trees; and the Vales, which in <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI>'s time, were filled with Vineyards, are now turn'd into Orchards, which yield plenty of Sider. The Towns and Villages stand mostly thick together, and so it is po∣pulous; the Houses numerous, and so 'tis sociable; the Churches fair and magnificent, and so 'tis ho∣nourable: But that which is one of the greatest Blessings of all, is the Noble River <HI>Severn,</HI> than which there is not any River in all this Island for its Channel broader, for Stream swifter, for va∣riety of Fish better stored, though sometimes it overflows its Banks; and when it hath roved a great way upon the Land, retires back again in Triumph as a victorious Conquerour.</P>
<P>This River <HI>Severn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Severn.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Sabrina,</HI> was so called from <HI>Sabrine,</HI> a fair Lady, concerning whom there goes this Story. <HI>Locrine,</HI> the Eldest Son of <HI>Brutus,</HI> who came first into <HI>Britain,</HI> and from whom, some Writers are of Opinion, our Country received its Denomination, took to Wife <HI>Guendoline,</HI> Daugh∣ter to <HI>Corineus</HI> Duke of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the Companion of that Noble <HI>Trojan</HI>; but notwithstanding this, he kept a very beautiful Mistress, whose Name was <HI>Estrilde,</HI> and by her had a Daughter, which he named <HI>Sabrine,</HI> whereupon he grew so enamou∣red of her, that after the Death of his Father-in-law <HI>Corineus,</HI> he put away his Wife, and Married this Lady; at which Act his Wife was so extream∣ly netled, that she immediately repairs into <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> makes her Complaint among her Friends, and Relations, and having gathered a great Pow∣er to revenge her Injury, she fought with her hus∣band <HI>Locrine</HI> at New-<HI>Troy,</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> and there slew him: After this, to execute her Revenge still in the highest degree, she took the Lady <HI>Estrilde,</HI> with her fair Daughter <HI>Sabrina,</HI> and drowned them both in this River.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11"/>Travelling over this delightsome Region, the first place of any Remark we arrived at, was <HI>Ci∣rencester,</HI> alias <HI>Circiter</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cirence∣ster.</HI> It was cal∣led by the <HI>Britains Kaerceri Rudborn</HI>'s Hist. of <HI>Winche∣ster.</HI></NOTE>; which the River <HI>Corinus,</HI> or <HI>Churne</HI> rising among the Wolds passeth by and giveth it its Name: It appears to have been a place of great Antiquity and Renown, from the old Roman Coins and Medals, and divers Marble Engraven Stones, which have been digged up hereabouts: Nay, a Judicious An∣tiquary Mr. <HI>Kennet</HI> has observed, That this place seems to have been as well the first, as the greatest of the <HI>Roman</HI> Stations, which the <HI>Bri∣tains</HI> had before made a place of Strength, and Confluence: That this <HI>Corinium</HI> is by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> Recorded, as the Metropolis, or Chief City of the <HI>Dobuni</HI>; and was after called <HI>Corinium Do∣hunorum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>British</HI> Chronicles tell us further, That this Town was burnt down, being set on Fire by a company of Sparrows, through an Invention de∣vised by one <HI>Gurmund.</HI> Certain it is, the Inhabi∣tants shew a Mount below the Town; which they Report this <HI>Gurmund</HI> cast up, which they corrupt∣ly call <HI>Grismund</HI>'s Tower:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gris∣mund<HI>'s Tower.</HI></NOTE> It was a long time sub∣ject to the West-<HI>Saxons</HI>; afterward the <HI>Mercians</HI> got it into their Possession, where it continued till the Establishment of the <HI>English</HI> Monarchy, under which it sustained very great Calamities, by the Incursion of the <HI>Danes</HI>: and 'tis probable, that <HI>Gur∣mon</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> whom some Historiographers call <HI>Guthrus</HI> and <HI>Gurmundus,</HI> was a great Instrument to augment its Troubles and Oppressions: However, there are still some Remains to be seen of old Rui∣nated Walls, and of an Abby built, as some con∣jecture, by the <HI>Saxons</HI>; afterward much repaired, or rather rebuilt by King <HI>Henry</HI> I: 'Tis now beau∣tified with a very handsome Church, having a high Spired Steeple, and hath once a Week a Market, and has formerly been Enriched with the Trade of Clothing, though that with many
<PB N="9" REF="11" MS="y"/>
other Privileges and Immunities they enjoyed, are now impaired and gone to decay.</P>
<P>From hence coursing over the Wolds, we came to the top of <HI>Burlipp</HI>-Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burlipp-<HI>Hill.</HI></NOTE> where we had a Pro∣spect of a very pleasant Vale; the Hill is craggy, steep, and high, from which descending by de∣grees, and passing through a Way which was for∣merly paved with Stone, and was undoubtedly one of the <HI>Roman</HI> high Ways, which here crossed one another, we came to <HI>Glocester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glocester.</NOTE> called by An∣tiquaries, <HI>Caer Gloyn,</HI> which took its Name either of <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperour, or of the Beauty and Brightness thereof, which the <HI>Britains</HI> call Gloyn, though others call it <HI>Kaerclan.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a City well Seated, and as well Inhabited, and of a considerable Trade, by reason of the Ri∣ver <HI>Severn,</HI> over which it has a fair Bridge, and being Navigable, Boats of great Burden come up to the Key side, loaded with several Commodities. 'Tis governed by a Mayor and Aldermen, and is adorned with 12 Parish Churches besides the Cathedral: And for the Strength of the Place, it was formerly on the Landside encompassed with a strong Wall, the standing Remains whereof shew what Force they have been of: On the Southside it had a strong Castle of square Stone now fall'n to Ruine. <HI>Craulin</HI> King of the West-<HI>Saxons</HI> Conquered this City from the <HI>Britains</HI> a∣bout the year 570; and 300 years after it fell into the Hands of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who miserably de∣faced it.</P>
<P>Soon after this <HI>Aldred,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> built the Cathedral, to which belongs now a Dean and Six Prebendaries and it hath been much enlar∣ged by the Charity of good Benefactors, <HI>John Hanly</HI> and <HI>Thomas Early</HI> adding to it the Chapel of the <HI>Virgin Mary; N.

<HI>Steeple:</HI> As for the Southside, it was repaired by the Free Offerings of the Inhabitants at the Se∣pulchre of <HI>Edward</HI> II. who lieth here Interred un∣der a Monument of Alabaster; and in the Quire, under a wooden-painted Tomb, lies <HI>Robert,</HI> the Eldest Son of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, who was deprived both of his Life and Kingdom, by his Younger Brother <HI>Henry</HI> I. having his Eyes first put out at <HI>Cardiff</HI>-Castle; and died thereafter 26 years Imprisonment.</P>
<P>Here likewise is the Monument of <HI>Lucius,</HI> who is said to have been the first Christian King in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>: Now, though by Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> in his Tra∣vels we are told, That there is a famous Chapel Erected to him, as their Great Apostle, near <HI>Coir,</HI> a Town of the <HI>Grisons,</HI> for the great Service he did to them, in working their Conversion; yet 'tis most probable that he lies Interred here: But how he came at first to be instructed in the Chri∣stian Faith, we have the most probable Account given us by the most Learned Bishop <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> in his Antiquities of the <HI>British</HI> Churches, which is this: That King <HI>Lucius</HI> hearing of the Christian Doctrine, either by the old <HI>British</HI> Christians, such as <HI>Eluanus</HI> and <HI>Meduinus</HI> are supposed to have been; or by some of <HI>M. Aurelius</HI> his Soldiers coming hi∣ther, after the great Deliverance of the <HI>Roman</HI> Ar∣my by the Prayers of the Christians, which had then lately happen'd, and occasion'd great Dis∣course every where. The Emperour himself, as <HI>Ter∣tullian</HI> saith, giving the Account of it in his own Letters, might upon this be very desirous to inform himself thoroughly about this Religion; and there being then frequent Entercourse betwixt <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> by reason of the Colonies that were set∣led, and the Governours and Soldiers passing to and fro, he might send <HI>Eluanus</HI> and <HI>Meduinus</HI> to be fully instructed in this Religion, and either the same Persons alone, or two others with them (called <HI>Fag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us</HI> and <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ianus</HI> commonly) coming

into <HI>Britain,</HI> might have so great Success, as to Baptize King <HI>Lucius,</HI> and many others, and there∣by inlarge the Christian Church here.</P>
<P>But to return from what we have made a little Digression, the Pillars of this Church are of an extraordinary Thickness, not to be Parallel'd in any Church of <HI>England</HI>: But that which makes it most Remarkable, is a curious piece of Archi∣tecture at the East-end of the Quire, called, <HI>The Whispering Place</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Whis∣pering Place.</NOTE> 'tis an Arch in the form of a Semi∣circle, 30 yards in Circuit, and so rare a Contri∣vance, that if any Person stand at one end of it, and Whisper never so softly, he that lays his Ear to the other end, will discover distinctly the Words he speaks.</P>

<P>A C D E F B is the Passage of the Voice, or Whispering Place; at A and B do the two Persons stand that Whisper to each other. At D, the middle of the Passage, is a Door and Entrance in∣to a Chapel, with Window-Cases on each side of the Door; and to my best Remembrance, there are one or two Places open upward in the Roof of the passage; from whence it is the Opinion of Mr. <HI>Childrey,</HI> in his <HI>Britannia Baconica,</HI> when he has occasion to speak of this Place, that the Chapel standing so in the middle, much conduceth to the conveying of the Sound so entirely, which is hel∣ped
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
by the open places of the Roof before-men∣tioned, for they help to draw in the Voice, which else would not so well enter into that narrow Pas∣sage, but reverberate back into that broad open place before the Whispering Entry; and the Rea∣son upon which he grounds his Opinion, that the Chapel doth a great part of the Work is this, Because, saith he, we see in Viols, Lutes, and o∣ther Musical Instruments, there are Holes cut in∣to the Belly of the Instrument just under the play∣ing or striking place, which we find by Experi∣ence, do much augment the Noise of the Notes, and make them more Audible.</P>
<P>But this being only a Conjecture, I shall leave it to be further discuss'd by those who delight in such kind of Speculation, and proceed to <HI>Lassing∣ton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Astroites at <HI>Lassing∣ton.</HI></NOTE> a little Village near <HI>Gloucester,</HI> where are found many Astroites, or Star-stones, being about the breadth of a silver Penny, but the thickness of half a Crown, flat, and pointed like a Star, or Mullet in Heraldry, only the Points of them are not sharp, but a little roundish, and of a greyish Colour, and on both sides curiously graved, (as it were by Art) as if there were a little Mullet within the great one: Being put into Vinegar, they have a Motion like the Astroites in <HI>Germany,</HI> which the Learned <HI>Cambden</HI> speaks of; and are more fully described by Mr. <HI>Childrey</HI> in his Natural Rarities of <HI>Gloucestershire.</HI></P>
<P>Having diverted our selves at <HI>Gloucester,</HI> we steer'd our Course for <HI>Tewksbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tewks∣bury.</NOTE> a Market-Town of a great Trade for Cloth, Mustard-Seed, but more especially for Stockings, of which the Townsmen every <HI>Saturday</HI> buy great Quantities from the Neighbouring Inhabitants: 'Tis situa∣ted among three pleasant Rivers; <HI>Severn</HI> on the one side enricheth it, and on the other <HI>Avon,</HI> and another small Rivolet which comes from the East; over each whereof stand Bridges which give En∣trance into it.

Nor is it of less Fame for the Memorable Battle fought here in 1471 be∣tween the House of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> which bloody day decided for that time, that great Con∣troversie, and left the Crown to the former.</P>
<P>In the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. there is a Story Recorded, of a <HI>Jew</HI> that lived in this Town, how that falling into a Jakes, or Privy, on the Jewish <HI>Sabbath,</HI> or <HI>Saturday,</HI> would by no means, out of Reverence to that Day, suffer any one to come and rescue him out of that Noisome place; where∣upon <HI>Richard,</HI> then Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> having some Intelligence of his refractary Sullenness, gave a strict charge, that no one should dare to take him out on the <HI>Sunday,</HI> for the Reverence of that Day; and so the poor Circumcised Wretch perished in that loathsome Dungeon through his own Folly.</P>
<P>Our abode at this place was but short, for we hasted into the Confines of <HI>Worcestershire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Worce∣stershire.</NOTE> which we found a very healthful and plentiful Country: In one part it is of Note for its Cheese, in most for its Perry, which is a very pleasant Liquor, made of the Juice of Pears, growing here in abundance in the Hedges; 'tis likewise full of Salt-Pits, and hath formerly been admired for abundance of Salt-Springs, which have been very oft discovered in this County: But that which makes it most Re∣nown'd, is the River <HI>Severn,</HI> which Streams along the Country, which as also the River <HI>Avon,</HI> is well replenished with divers sorts of Fish; but more particularly seem'd to be design'd on pur∣pose by Nature, as Stews and Ponds, for the Pre∣servation of Lampreys, a Fish of great esteem in that County, and sent far and near as a very great
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
Present throughout divers parts of <HI>England</HI>; they are called Lampreys from the <HI>Latin</HI> word <HI>Lampe∣tra,</HI> as if they had their Denomination from lick∣ing of Rocks, they are like Eels, slippery and blackish; however, on their Bellies they are of a blewish colour; in the Spring they are most whol∣som and sweet, for in the Summer the inner Nerve, which is to them instead of a Backbone, waxeth too hard for Concoction: Naturalists observe, that these Fish receive, and let in Water at seven Holes, for that they have no Gills which are any way visible; the <HI>Romans</HI> always thought this a very noble Dish, and when any Person of Quality de∣sired a sumptuous Feast, he would be sure to be provided with these; and the <HI>Italians</HI> at this day are very much delighted with them, and conse∣quently by their Cookery, make them exceeding delicate to the Taste, for they take a Lamprey, and killing it in Malmsey, close the Mouth with a Nutmeg, and fill all the Holes with as many Cloves, then they roll it up, and put Filberd, Nut-Kernels stamp'd, crums of Bread, Oyl, Malmsey, and Spices to it, and so they boil it with great care, and then turn it over a soft gentle Fire of Coals in a Frying-pan.</P>
<P>The first place we came to which was Remark∣able in this County was <HI>Worcester</HI> it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worce∣ster.</NOTE> where the River <HI>Severn,</HI> which in other parts of the County runs along in a swift Current, glides on here more softly with a gentle Stream, admiring as it were, this City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This City was called by the <HI>Bri∣tains Ka∣erkoran∣gon.

Cloth, by which the Inhabitants become Wealthy and Creditable: The Houses are neat and well built, the Streets clean and well paved, the Churches in number many, in Order and Beauty excellent, especially the Cathedral, in which are divers small Pillars all of pure Marble, which stand in Rows, and do uphold that vast Bulk and Fabrick, some∣what strange to see the Body larger than the Sup∣porters, and that so small Props should be able to bear up so great a Weight: This Church, say some Historians, was first built by <HI>Ethelred,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> tho' others by Bishop <HI>Sexwolph</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bosel</HI> was the first Bi∣shop here, say the An∣nals of <HI>Worce∣cester.

Nevertheless, was attended with the same ill Fortune and Success, which was at that time his chief Attendants; and having but a small Army in comparison of the numberless number of Rebels that were poured in upon him, was totally defeated at this City, several of his Nobles Slain and took Prisoners, the rest forced to fly for their Lives, and himself constrain'd to make his E∣scape as privately as he could, and to betake him∣self into a Wood in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> where hiding himself in the shady Boughs of a well-spread Oak, he found more Pity and Security from Trees and Woods, than from some of his own unnatural and bloody Subjects: However, this City is now again restored to its Lustre, and like the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> being revived out of its own Ashes, is raised up to its Prestine Splendour and Magnificence.</P>
<P>Having sufficiently satisfied our selves with the Varieties of that City, we came into the Confines of the Eastern part of <HI>Herefordshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hereford∣shire.</NOTE> which appear∣ed very Rocky and Mountainous at the first; but having passed those Rocky parts, we began to find the Country more pleasant to the Eye; for we discovered it to be a Fertile Soil, the Valleys thick with Corn, and the Meadows abounding with Grass, and well watered with Rivers, the Hills covered with Sheep, and the Hedges full of Apple-Trees, which bear a sort of Fruit called Red∣streaks, of which they make the best Syder in <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> In a word, we found it according to the u∣sual Report, which is made of it, to yield to no Country in this Nation, for three W. W. W, Wheat, Wool, and Water, to which formerly might have been added Wood, but that the Iron Works have since destroyed it very much, and made it become less plentiful.</P>
<P>Passing through <HI>Bramyard,</HI> a small Market-Town of no great Consequence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mereford.</NOTE> we came to <HI>He∣reford,</HI> the chief City of this County, which is situated almost in the middle of it, and watered
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
by two pleasant Rivers, <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Lugg,</HI> which by their happy Union not far from this place advance her Felicity, and enrich her Soil: Antiquaries are of Opinion, That this City had its Rise from <HI>A∣riconium,</HI> which hath at this day no manner of Form of a Town, as having been thrown down by an Earthquake, only some do imagine it to have stood in a place which they now call <HI>Kenche∣ster,</HI> three Miles distant from this City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kenche∣ster.</NOTE> and they do build their Conjectures from the Ruines of old Walls, which are there Conspicuous; as like∣wise from some four-square paving Tiles, and thick Bricks, as well as several <HI>Roman</HI> Coins dig∣ged up thereabouts, though now the place which they mention is all over-grown with Shrubs, Bushes, and Brambles: We observed, when we went to visit this place, three or four Receptacles in an old piece of Ruin'd Wall, in which the Owners had found some Urns, which argues the place to have been of great Antiquity; however, her Sister <HI>Hereford,</HI> which is now become Beauti∣ful by the others Decay, justly claims the Pre-emi∣nence above all other Places within this County: She is thought first to have shown her Head under the <HI>Saxon</HI> Heptarchy, and is supposed to have re∣ceived great Helps and Increase by Religion; and the Martyrdom of <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> King of the East <HI>Angles,</HI> who, when he Courted the Daughter of <HI>Offa,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> was treacherously put to Death by <HI>Quendred, Offa</HI>'s Wife: Hereupon, being Registred as a Martyr, he had a Church built, and Dedicated to him by <HI>Milfrid</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> A. D. 825. which after the Esta∣blishment of a Bishop's See in it, grew to great Wealth and Honour through the Devout and Pi∣ous Liberality of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and then of the West-<HI>Saxons,</HI> and is thought never to have suffer∣ed any Misfortune, untill <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor's time, when <HI>Griffith,</HI> Prince of South-<HI>Wales,</HI> and <HI>Algarus,</HI> having raised a Rebellion against King

<HI>Edward,</HI> and led away Captive <HI>Leofgarus,</HI> the Bi∣shop, sacked the City, and burnt the Cathedral Afterward the <HI>Normans</HI> at the East End of the Church, by the River <HI>Wye,</HI> built a strong Castle, Fortified the City with a Wall; and by the Trench near the Castle is a very fine Spring, call'd St. <HI>E∣thelbert</HI>'s Well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Ethel∣bert</HI>'s Well.</NOTE> famous formerly for Miracles, to which, no question, but in that Superstitious Age, there was a great Resort of the Lame and the Blind, with their Vows, and their Offerings; the Sanctity of Waters being such a Devout Fancy a∣mong our Ancestors, as has been truly observed by that Indefatigable Searcher into Antiquity, the Ingenious Mr. <HI>White Kennet,</HI> that after Ages were forced to restrain the horrid Superstition of Well-Worship, by a Canon in a Council under <HI>Edgar,</HI> and after this too by some other Episcopal Injunctions.</P>
<P>Within this City are four Parish Churches, and Bishop <HI>Reinelme,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> I. founded the Cathedral that now is, being a beau∣tiful and magnificent Structure, adorned with di∣vers Monuments of ancient Prelates, and Abbots: To this adjoyns divers Houses, for the Dignitaries of the Church, and a College for 12 Vicars, who live after an Academical way under a <HI>Praefectus,</HI> who presides over them, and supplies them with all Necessaries, to encourage their Attendance up∣on all Divine Offices: So ready were our Ance∣stors to promote Learning, and advance such Per∣sons whose quick and acute Parts were eclipsed un∣der mean and slender Fortunes.</P>
<P>The City is govern'd by a Mayor, (who is An∣nually sworn upon <HI>Michaelmas</HI>-Day) 12 Alder∣men, a Recorder, and divers Common-Council Men; and by their Charter have Privileges for particular Companies and Societies amongst them∣selves, who have several distinct Halls and Petty-Laws Enacted, for regulating and ordering their Affairs in Trade: It hath three Markets a Week,
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>
in which there is plenty of Corn, and all other sorts of Provisions: And finally, it is observable, That in the late <HI>Civil Wars</HI> it was never taken by the Rebels; and though the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army came a∣gainst it, yet they found such hot Service without, by the playing of the Ordinance from within, that they were forced at last to Retreat Ingloriously.</P>
<P>Not far distant from this City stands an ancient House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rotheras.</NOTE> belonging formerly to the Family of the <HI>Bodenhams,</HI> since in the Possession of the Heirs of Mr. <HI>Van-Acker,</HI> which is one of the most delight∣ful and sweetest Seats in all this part of the Coun∣ty, having a spacious Park before it, the River <HI>Wye</HI> behind it, pleasant Meadows on the one side, and fruitful Tillage on the other, and having had such great plenty of Apple-Trees belonging to it, as we were credibly inform'd by those that knew it, that take but one Apple from each Tree, and it would make a Hogshead of Sider; and the Country People there have a Proverb, which goes currant amongst them, <HI>Every one cannot live at</HI> Ro∣theras, it having formerly been a place of too profuse Hospitality.</P>
<P>Having spent some time at <HI>Hereford,</HI> and being now upon the Borders of <HI>Wales,</HI> we resolved to make a visit to some parts of that Country: To this purpose we Travelled into <HI>Monmouthshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon∣mouth∣shire.</NOTE> in some places very Fruitful, and in others as Bar∣ren, though Nature supplies those Defects, by gi∣ving the Inhabitants great plenty of Iron, which proves to them a very advantageous Commodity.</P>
<P>We found the ways near <HI>Monmouth</HI> very hard and rugged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon∣mouth.</NOTE> and that Town to be environ'd with Hills on all sides, the Ruins of its Wall and Castle argue its great Antiquity; it hath a fair Church and Market-place, with a Hall for the Assizes and Sessions; 'tis govern'd by a Mayor, Recorder, and Aldermen, and the Inhabitants do generally speak both the <HI>Welsh</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Tongue: They told us there of great Immunities and Privi∣leges

granted to them by the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI>; but for nothing is it so much Renown'd, as in that it was the Native place of <HI>Henry</HI> V. that dreadful Scourge of the <HI>French,</HI> and glorious Pil∣lar of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, who Conquer'd <HI>Charles</HI> VI.

<P>After we were pass'd this Town, we found the Ways still more troublesom and uneasie, and were entertained with no other Objects, but what the stony Rocks, and dangerous Cliffs, the towring Mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vast high Mountains in <HI>Wales.</HI></NOTE> and craggy Precipices did afford us, being covered with Flocks of Sheep, or Herds of Goats, or Multitudes of Oxen, which they call Runts.

<P>That <HI>Cardiganshire</HI> being a Hilly Maritime Country, was not formerly planted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardigan∣shire.</NOTE> or garnish∣ed with Cities, may be gathered from that Speech of their Prince <HI>Caratacus,</HI> who being taken Priso∣ner by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and carried to <HI>Rome</HI>; when he had throughly viewed the Magnificence of that City, <HI>What mean you,</HI> saith he, <HI>when you have such stately Buildings of your own, to covet such poor and mean Cottages as ours are?</HI></P>

At the first discovery made by these Storms, the Trees we speak of, lay so thick, that the whole Shoar seem'd nothing but a lopped Grove, from whence may be gathered, that the Sea hath overflow'd much Land on this Coast, as it hath done upon the Shoars of many other Countries bordering upon the Sea, which is to be imputed to the Ignorance of former Ages, who had not those excellent Arts and Ways to re∣press the Fury of the Sea, which have been since discover'd.</P>

from this, as well as from the other, since both were equally uncomfortable, by reason of their deprivation from the least glimmerings of light, and consequently had the same Circumstances to beget both horrour and astonishment: however we pluck'd up our Spirits, and crept in one after another, as fast as we could conveniently.</P>
<P>The Cave, as we went along, was parted into several kind of Rooms; the names whereof our Guides informed us to be thus: The first was the Kitchen, in which by the Door sticks out a large mass of the Rock, which they tell us was the Por∣ter's Head formerly the Keeper of this Cave; it seems to bear that kind of resemblance, and tho' by that is a Stone which they call the Tomb-stone, under which they report that he lies interred, and his Dog hard by him too, metamorphos'd into the same lapideous Substance, yet their Transfor∣mations are not so strange and wonderful, though perhaps something too fabulous to be given credit to, as the variety the Rock affords into which they are incorporated, part of it glistering like Silver, and part like Diamonds, and both appear∣ing very pleasant to the Eye. A little farther on the Right Hand is another piece of the Rock, that bears the resemblance of a Bell; and on the Left, of a Vessel, which they term a <HI>Ceave,</HI> in which the Beer of an old Sorceress (Cousin to the famous <HI>Circe,</HI> Lady Governess of this dismal Cave) used to be work'd in.

first view black and sooty, but inwardly seems to be a Statue of Alabaster, by reason of its whiteness, though it is most probably the product of Nature, not of Art, because the place is very unfit and un∣suitable for any Artist to exercise his Skill in, it being very oft so low, that it is impossible here and there for any one to stand upright in it, and therefore it was that we were enforced frequently to stoop, and buckle almost double, for fear of dashing our Heads against the Rock, until we came to some Steps we were to descend, where the descent likewise was tedious and frightful; for on the Right Hand the Rock hung over us very low and sloping, and on the Left a Rivolet which, with a pretty loud noise, glides along the Cave, made us cautious in our Steps, till at last we came Sweating into another Room, which is called the Hall; and here at first sight we were en∣tertained with as great a Rarity as Nature hath in all her Store-Houses: 'Tis a Cistern almost square, about six Foot each way, and of a considerable depth, always brimful of Water, supplied by the drops which continually fall from above, and yet never runs over: and the reason is this, because as the Water increaseth, so doth the Cistern too, and both of them had then been observed, within the space of Twenty Years, to have received a conside∣rable augmentation; which is the more probable, because the Water is of a petrefying nature; and if any thing be cast into it, in a short time it disco∣vers this secret quality by an outward incrustation of that which is thrown in. The drops which hang above are like congealed Icecles, as clear as Crystal, some of which falling down into the Water grow harder in substance, though they ap∣pear pretty pellucid. Round about this Hall hang four Stones resembling four Flitches of Bacon, for the outside is blackish, and the inside white. In this place the Daughter of the old Sorceress hath took up her residence, and appears to your Eye
<PB N="35" REF="24"/>
like a Statue of a Woman big with Child; she is of a different colour from her Mother, being much more dusky. But nothing is more pretty to behold than those which they call the Organ-Pipes, placed upon one side of the Rock, and are very like to those we have in our Churches, some being of bigger, and some of lesser dimensions; in the middle of a good reasonable thickness, though at the ends sharp and slender. After some more difficulties in our Passage, and no less dangerous than before, we came into another part of the Cave, more strange than any we had yet seen: 'Tis a place which they call the Dancing-Room, so well contrived and arched above, that Nature hath here wrought what Art can never be able to attain: If you look up, the variety of Colours which are there to be seen by the light of the Can∣dles, and the checquered Configurations of the Rock, which is now very high above your Head, will both feast your Eyes and refresh your Body, which by that time is sufficiently wearied by the tediousness as well as the trouble of the Passage; for there is so great a glistering, such a lustre as it were of Silver and Precious Stones about you, that you would be ready to mistake your self, and think that you were in the Palace of some great Monarch of the World, and not in the subterra∣neous Caverns of the Earth. If you look down, there you will find no stony, hard, rugged tract to perplex you, but a fine, even, sandy Floor to divert you; and indeed it was beyond expecta∣tion, that we who had beheld before nothing but such craggy Stones and dangerous Passages, should at last arrive in so spacious and delightful a Place: They told us it was not unusual for the Gentlemen and Ladies in those Parts to bring Musick and Dance here, the Musick, by reason of the Eccho, making a Melody more sweet than ordinary. We paused and breathed a little here, delighting our selves as well with it, as also with the resemblance
<PB N="36" REF="25"/>
of a Chimney, which we took really to be one, it being of that Fashion, and having in it a kind of black moist matter, which, if you touch, it will stick to your Fingers and black them like Soot, and yet no Fire was ever known to be there. But we were not as yet satisfied, though we were near half a Mileunder Ground in a dismal Grotto, but went on farther to a place termed the Cellar, that is curiously Vaulted; and 'tis very usual to carry Bottles of Wine, and drink there upon a Stone Table, which is formed out of the Rock. In this place lies a huge Massy Stone, which they call the Great Gun; the nature of which is this, take it but up in your Hands, and let it fall down to the Ground, and a great Gun cannot give a louder report: We tried this experiment thrice, but we thought the Rock we were under would have rent in Pieces about our Ears, yet they who were half way in the Cave, or at the Mouth of it, or above it, heard no noise at all; this we found experimentally true, for one of the Gentlemen who entred in with us, being beat out with the difficulty of the Tracts, staid about the middle-way, and when we returned back to him, he assured us, that where he stood he had heard nothing of a noise. But at length, at the end of the Cellar, after we had gone down lower some few Steps, a Rivolet there was that gave a period to our Progress; it was pretty deep, and as clear as Crystal, the Water extream cold, but very pleasant to the Palate, and runs along the Cave sometimes in a small, and sometimes in a larger Current, where taking up some of the congealed Matter that lies at the bot∣tom of it, we found it very hard, of a dusky co∣lour, and of a round consistency, just as if a little company of Hailstones were cemented and joined together, and the River running along under Ground, tho' its Head from whence it first springs, like that of the <HI>Nile</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> is not as yet plain∣ly discovered, and conveying it self at last out of
<PB N="37" REF="25"/>
the Cave sets, as they say, Thirty Mills on work, after it comes into the adjacent Country.</P>
<P>When we were got thus far, almost a Mile under Ground, as our Guides told us, we began to consider how we should return, and get out safe again from this place of Horrour and Dark∣ness to the Regions of Light, being afraid to find the same Difficulties we had encountred with in our entrance. But though the place was some∣thing resembling an infernal Abyss, and our Pas∣sage into it proved so troublesom and irksom, yet we came back without any toil, or rather with great facility and pleasure, notwithstanding it is impossible to find out the way without a Guide, there being so many windings and turnings; nor could the Guides themselves ever extricate them∣selves out of this darksom Labyrinth, but by the light of Candles, whereby they are enabled to steer their Course. However at last we made a shift to creep up again to the top of the Rock, just as merry <HI>Lucian</HI> tells us old <HI>Menippus</HI> did out from a hole in <HI>Lebadia,</HI> after he returned from Hell, and had ended his Discourses with the Ghosts below, and went back to the place where we first dismounted, and left our Horses to graze with the neighbouring Shepherds.</P>
<P>After we had got breath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bath.</NOTE> and were a little re∣cruited, we mounted again, and rode away for <HI>Bath,</HI> which by several old Writers is called <HI>Aca∣mannum, Akemancester,</HI> from the old Roman way called <HI>Akemanstreet-way</HI>; which, say Antiquaries, took its name from them that being full of Aches and Achings, made it their way to this place for ease of their Pains. We could not discover it, un∣til we came just upon it, lying low, and on all sides surrounded with Hills, out of which issue forth many Springs of a wonderful virtue, though some of them are very Sulphureous and unplea∣sant to the Taste. It is watered with the <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it has a Stone-Bridge, and is environed
<PB N="38" REF="26"/>
with a Wall, commodious for its Market-place, and handsomly adorned with three Churches, one whereof is very large and spatious, built in the form of a Cathedral, the Steeple is four-square, and hath a Ring of tunable Bells, and the Quire is grac'd with a small but sweet Organ: And in it are erected several ancient and stately Monu∣ments of Persons of great Quality, and of some Bishops of this See, who have been most noble Be∣nefactors to it. 'Tis govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen, and the Assizes are generally kept there in the Summer time: But that which is most remarkable, and causeth a concourse not only of the Nobility and Gentry, but of the Commonalty too from all parts of the Nation hither, are the Baths, which are not inferiour to any whatever in <HI>Europe:</HI> The Waters herein are hot, of a blue∣ish Colour, strong scent, and send forth thin Va∣pours; and as, without question, they have strengthened many weak and feeble Limbs, so do they cure divers Diseases, which are incident and destructive to humane Nature, by causing Men to Sweat either more or less proportionably to their Distempers. There are four or five which are principally in request, one Triangular, and called the <HI>Cross-Bath,</HI> from the Cross that stood formerly in the midst of it; 'tis about twenty-five Foot long, and as broad at one end, the heat of it gentler than the rest, because it has fewer Springs. Whilst we continued in the Town, we were presented by the Serjeant of this Bath with a piece of Earth, which was digged up here at the loss of a Spring; it smelt like Sulphur, and burnt like Soot. We saw likewise a piece of an Elm-Tree, which was digged up at the same time, together with the Skull of a Woman taken up then too, which are supposed to have lain there many Years before the Bath was so enclosed. The Orders are strict and regular, and Persons of the greatest Quality prefer to bathe here, and to drink
<PB N="39" REF="26"/>
the Water hereof with Limona Sugar, rather than of the other. Hard by this stands the Hot <HI>Bath,</HI> not much frequented save by those who have quite lost the use of their Limbs, the Water hereof being much hotter than the rest. Not far from this is that which they call the <HI>Leper</HI>'s <HI>Bath,</HI> which is be∣liev'd to be very efficacious against that loathsom Disease, and an Hospital or Spittle, built by <HI>Reginald,</HI> Bp. of <HI>Bath,</HI> for the use of poor, aged, decrepit People. About the middle of the Town, nearer to the great Church, are the King and Queen's <HI>Baths,</HI> divided only by a Wall; the last having no Spring in it, but receiving the Water from the King's <HI>Bath,</HI> which is about 60 Foot square, and has in the middle of it many hot Springs that make its heat the greater: Each of these two <HI>Baths</HI> have a Pump to pump Water upon the Diseased; and I have observed some Persons who have been troubled with great Pains in their Heads, or other parts of their Body, have suffered very great quantities of this scalding Water to be poured on them by their Guides. Hereabouts, formerly, was found an ancient Statue of <HI>Hercules</HI> amongst other great Mo∣numents of Antiquity, holding a Serpent in his Hand, which was discover'd in the Ruines of an ancient Temple, perhaps that which was here Consecrated to <HI>Minerva,</HI> and it might be thought very convenient, that he being the Tu∣telary Patriot of such places, and having so fre∣quently exposed himself to hard Labours, and manifold Dangers, might now and then ease, and refresh his wearied Limbs by such Purgations, as the <HI>Bath</HI> could afford him. In this, and other <HI>Baths,</HI> hang divers Crutches of lame and decrepit Persons, which they left behind them as Trophies of their Recovery, being perfectly cured of their Lameness and Infirmity, and restor'd again to their former Health and Strength. There is still one behind, which is call'd the Horse-<HI>Bath,</HI> which is said to be as effectual for the cure of lame and
<PB N="40" REF="27"/>
foundred Horses, and the removal of some other Distempers, which are incident to those kind of Animals.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wiltshire.</NOTE>Having pass'd away some few days very plea∣santly in this Town, we set forward for <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> a County healthy, pleasant, and fruitful; the Nor∣thern part of it is Hilly, and hath formerly been shaded with thick Woods, and well watered with wholsom Springs; the Southern part is plain and open, very convenient for feeding great Flocks of Sheep, and through the middle of it, from East to West, a great large Ditch runs across, call'd <HI>Wanedike,</HI> the Banks whereof, as the Vulgar will have it, were thrown up by the Devil on a <HI>Wed∣nesday:</HI> But the Learned Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> is of Opi∣nion, That it was made by the West-<HI>Saxons,</HI> for a Boundary to their Kingdom against the <HI>Merci∣ans</HI>: We travelled over some of these wide and large Plains for near twenty Miles, untill we ar∣rived at a place call'd <HI>Stonehenge,</HI> some four or five Miles distant from <HI>Salisbury.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stone∣henge.</NOTE>It is call'd by ancient Historiographers, <HI>Chorea Gigantum,</HI> from its Magnitude, and contains with∣in the Circumference of three hundred Foot, a rude and indigested Mass of vast large Stones, rough, and of a grey Colour, 25 Foot in length, 10 in breadth, and 8 in thickness: they look as if they were hewn square, and are joyn'd two and two together, and every couple hath a third Stone lying across, which is fasten'd by Tenons that enter into Morraises, not closed with any Mortar; it ap∣pears as if they had been set in three Ranks go∣ing round as Circles one within another, whereof the uttermost and largest contain in compass about three hundred Foot, but the other Ranks are decay'd, and some of them being fall'n down to the Ground, as it is something difficult to compute their Num∣ber, so if they be rubbed, or scraped, and Wa∣ter thrown upon the Scrapings, they will (say some) heal any green Wound, or old Sore. It is
<PB N="41" REF="27"/>
very strange to think how such vast Bulks should happen in this place, whenas there are no other kind of Stones even of smaller Dimensions near, or about it, therefore some not irrationally con∣jecture that they are not Natural, or had their first growth here, but were Artificially cemented into that hard and durable Substance from some large Congeries of Sand, and other unctuous Matter mixt together; Just as there hath been visible at <HI>Rome,</HI> Cisterns made of Sand and Chalk so artifi∣cially and closely conjoyn'd, that they have pass'd for the Product of Nature, and not of Art, and therefore it is not an improbable Conjecture, which is made by the Author of the History of <HI>Alchester,</HI> Publish'd amongst other Parochial Antiquities of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> by the Industrious Mr. <HI>Kennet,</HI> that they are not, as some Fable, Giants Stones fetch'd from <HI>Mount-Karel</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by <HI>Merlyn's</HI> Art, that Renowned Magician, but might be made out of that Cliff over-against old <HI>Sarum,</HI> the colour of which Clay they still represent; and being scra∣ped with a Knife, a Man may discern this Clay cemented with some other glewy Substance, as Plaister of <HI>Paris</HI> and such like, Erected not in Me∣mory of those Nobles, whose Tombs in heaps of Earth appear still thereabouts, slain treacherously by <HI>Hengist,</HI> when he call'd, his Son-in-law <HI>Gourti∣gern,</HI> and the <HI>Britains</HI> to feast there; but for a Tro∣phy of some Memorable Victory thereabouts ob∣tain'd, as <HI>Necham</HI> the Poet saith, by <HI>Ʋter Pendra∣gon</HI>; or as others, by <HI>Arthur</HI> the Valiant, and to that seems the ancient <HI>Bard Theliesinus</HI> to allude: But <HI>Necham</HI>'s Verse is this:

<P><PB N="42" REF="28"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salisbury.</NOTE>From hence we rode to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> or <HI>Sarisbury,</HI> which some derive from <HI>Caesar</HI>'s <HI>Burg,</HI> and in our way beheld the place where formerly old <HI>Wilton,</HI> the Metropolis of this County, stood which had then upon its Gates, in honour to the <HI>Romans,</HI> a black Spread-Eagle: It was also call'd <HI>Willey,</HI> or <HI>Ellandun,</HI> that is, <HI>Elen</HI>'s Town: for here, or at <HI>Chloren,</HI> or at old <HI>Sarum,</HI> saith the <HI>Al∣chester</HI> Historian, being, before Guns were inven∣ted, an invincible hold, St. <HI>Helen,</HI> at her return out of <HI>Wales,</HI> did remain as well for her better Safety; as also to be near the South-Seas, to ex∣pect daily News and Tydings from <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour in the East Parts; as also from his Sons, her Nephews, who were in the Western. 'Tis si∣tuated (saith <HI>Cambden</HI>) where the two Rivers, <HI>Willeybrook,</HI> and <HI>Adderbourn</HI> meet: and here it was that <HI>Egbert</HI> King of the West-<HI>Saxons</HI> in the year 823, fought the second Battle against <HI>Beor∣wulphus</HI> the <HI>Mercian,</HI> so bloody on both sides, that the River <HI>Avon</HI> was dyed red with the Blood of the Slain: And in the year 871, <HI>Alfred</HI> having maintain'd a long Fight against the <HI>Danes,</HI> up∣on the first onset had Success, but was at last quite Routed, his Forces defeated, and himself forced to fly to save his own Life. In the <HI>Saxon</HI> Reign it mightily flourish'd, and <HI>Edgar</HI> building there a <HI>Nunnery,</HI> made his Daughter <HI>Editha,</HI> Lady Governess thereof, afterwards being long exposed to the Fury of <HI>Suenus</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> who was its mor∣tal Enemy, and deserted by the Bishops, who were its main support, it went to decay, and al∣most return'd again into its first Principles of No∣thing; and so <HI>Sorbiodunum,</HI> or old <HI>Salisbury</HI> then, and since new <HI>Salisbury,</HI> which hath sprang from that, have quite extinguish'd its Primitive Lustre and Glory. Old <HI>Salisbury</HI> was seated upon a Hill, expos'd much to Winds and Storms, very dry, barren and uncomfortable, by reason of the great defect of Water throughout the whole City, tho'
<PB N="43" REF="28"/>
it was well fortify'd, as appears still by some re∣maining pieces of old Walls. <HI>Kinricus</HI> the <HI>Saxon;</HI> in the year 553 first sack'd, and took it, being very fortunate in all his Enterprises he undertook against the <HI>Britains</HI>; and in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Senior, <HI>Osmund,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Sherborne,</HI> Transla∣ted the See hither, and built a Cathedral Church, though <HI>Suenus</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> not long after having ta∣ken and burnt the City, that likewise underwent the same fatal Calamity, and were both levell'd with the Ground, till both of them were raised a∣gain in <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour's time; for after that he had made his Progress throughout <HI>England,</HI> he at last summoned all the three Orders of the Na∣tion to meet here, and take the Oaths of Allegi∣ance to him: But after this, in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> I. the Citizens being oppress'd by the in∣solency of the Soldiers, and very much incommo∣ded by a continual want of Water, resolv'd to free themselves from these Inconveniencies, by transplanting themselves into another Soil, which they unanimously agreed upon, and seated them∣selves about a Mile from this place, in a more plea∣sant Valley, where the Flowry Meads, and Chry∣stal streamed Rivers gave them a more chearful Welcome, and endearing Entertainment. After the Plantation of this new Colony, <HI>Richard Pore</HI> first Bishop of <HI>Chichester,</HI> and then of this place, did likewise transplant the Cathedral from that barren dry place, in which it was first Erected near to the old Castle of the Earls of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and built it at last in a more pleasant Soil, and by the Advice and Contrivance of the most excellent and ingenious Artificers, not only Natives, but Fo∣reigners, whom he drew hither by his large Re∣wards, he raised it to that Splendour and Magnifi∣cence, that it now vies both for Stateliness and Workmanship, with the most noted Cathedrals throughout the whole Kingdom. The Steeple is built in form of a Pyramid, very high, and as the
<PB N="44" REF="29"/>
<HI>Pole-Star</HI> directs the <HI>Pilot</HI> at Sea, so doth this Spire direct the wandring Traveller over the Plain, dis∣covering its lofty Head near the distance of twenty Miles; but the Admirableness of the Structure consists in this, That it hath as many Pillars as there are Hours in the Year, and these not so closed, but you may see the Interstices betwixt them, and shake some that are of a lesser size; as many Win∣dows as there are Days in the Year, and these very Artificially adorn'd, and curiously painted to Ad∣miration; and as many Gates as there are Months, all which are thus comprised in an ingenious Copy of Verses:
<Q><L>Mira canam, Soles quot continet Annus, in unà</L>

<L>So many Windows in one Church we see.</L>
<L>So many Marble Pillars there appear,</L>
<L>As there are Hours throughout the Fleeting Year.</L>
<L>So many Gates as Moons one Year doth view,</L>
<L>Strange Tale to tell, yet not so strange as true.</L></Q>
And as the Church was then Re-edify'd, so was the City much enlarg'd, by which means since its Houses are grown stately; its <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> for the use of the Mayor and Aldermen is beautiful; its Churches are many and glorious; its Streets, by reason of divers Rivolets, convey'd in Chan∣nels through the midst of them sweet and cleanly; its Gardens delightful, and fragrant, and nothing wanting to please and gratifie either the Eye or Palate.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="29"/>From hence we coursed over the Plains directly to <HI>Winchester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Winche∣ster.</NOTE> which by Antiquaries has been call'd <HI>Venta Belgarum,</HI> as <HI>Bristol</HI> was <HI>Venta Simenorum</HI>; and amongst the <HI>Britains</HI> it had the Name likewise of <HI>Caer-Guent:</HI> It was of great Repute amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> and no less famous in the time of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and flourished as greatly under the Power of the <HI>Normans,</HI> till once or twice both Fire and Sword in an envious Emulation strove together to deface it; but it is grown again since very fair and populous, large and stately, is computed within the Walls to be about a Mile in length, is pleasant∣ly seated in a Vale betwixt two Hills, and hath six Gates which give Entrance into the City, tho' it was much defaced in the late <HI>Civil Wars</HI>; as like∣wise the Castle which formerly hath been accoun∣ted altogether impregnable. This is the Castle that <HI>Mawd</HI> the Empress having held out, after she had taken it, a considerable time against King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and after by a close Siege being in great danger to be Re-taken, fearing by that means to fall into her Enemies Hand, she secured her self by this cun∣ning Stratagem; she commanded it should be given out for a Truth, that she was certainly dead; and upon this order'd her self to be carried out upon a Bier, as if she had been so indeed, and by this means provided for her own safety. Upon the Wall hereof hangs the Round Table so much talk∣ed of by the Vulgar, and call'd King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Round Table; whether this can justly claim so great Antiquity, as is attributed to it, I shall not under∣take to determine; yet certain it is, that these very Tables are of a long standing, for formerly, after Justs and Turnaments, when there happen'd to be any great Entertainments amongst the valiant Champions of the Nation, it was usual for all such to sit round them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Whar∣tons Angl.

It was always held in great Veneration by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> because divers of their Kings were Interr'd in it, and was call'd by them the old Monastery, to distinguish it from the new one founded by <HI>Alured,</HI> in which he placed a Fraternity of <HI>Presby∣ters,</HI> who it seems, by a great Miracle of the Cross speaking, and disapproving their Order, were all expell'd from thence by <HI>Dunstan,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who substituted <HI>Monks</HI> in their Room: These Monasteries were joyn'd so near to one ano∣ther, that it did often create a Disturbance at their Devotions, and hence arose great Feuds and Con∣tentions amongst the Brethren: besides a great Cur∣rent of Water running from the Western Gate of the City in divers Channels to this new Monastery, did stagnate, and so caus'd the Air to be foggy and unwholsom.

Here is one thing yet further not to be pass'd by in Silence, That when King <HI>Alfred</HI> di∣vided his Kingdom into Counties, Hundreds, and Tythings, he had an Inquisition taken and dige∣sted into a Register, call'd <HI>Dome-boc,</HI> which was reposited in the Church of <HI>Winchester,</HI> thence call'd <HI>Codex Wintoniensis,</HI> a Model afterward followed by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, in his <HI>Domes-Day</HI> Book, which Mr. <HI>Kennet</HI> observes was for some time kept in the same Church.</P>
<P>But to return again into our Discourse relating to the City, we find it not only to have attain'd a great Eminency for its Religious Houses, for its pleasant Gardens, for its Brooks and Meadows, for its publick and private Edifices, for its great

Hall, wherein the Assizes are usually held for the County of <HI>Southampton,</HI> not to be parallell'd for length and breadth by any throughout this Nation, except <HI>Westminster,</HI> but likewise for the true and exact Rules of Equity and Justice, which are fol∣low'd and prescrib'd by its chief Magistrates and Governours, and before we take our leaves of it, we shall add for a Conclusion, that as in the time of <HI>Athelstane</HI> King of the West-<HI>Saxons,</HI> that Invin∣cible Hero, <HI>Guy</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> is reported, in a single Combat, to have slain <HI>Colobraild,</HI> the <HI>Danish</HI> Giant in <HI>Hide-Mead</HI> near this City; so <HI>Waltheof,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> being beheaded here with∣out the Walls, in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Con∣querour, is observ'd as the very first Example of Beheading in this Island.</P>
<P>Having took a sufficient Prospect of the great Curiosities of this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Surrey,</NOTE> we advanc'd forward in∣to <HI>Surrey,</HI> q. d. South-<HI>Rey,</HI> from its Situation on the Southside of the <HI>Thames,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> calling that <HI>Rey</HI> which we term a River. The Skirts of this County are noted for their Fruitfulness; and the middle parts for their Barrenness, which has occasion'd the saying, <HI>That</HI> Surrey <HI>is like a course piece of Cloth with a fine List</HI>: However, in point of Health, the middle parts have the advantage, besides the Pleasure they yield by their <HI>Downs</HI> in Hunting and Horse-Races. 'Tis adorn'd is most places with very stately Palaces of Gentlemen and Merchants, who by reason of the Parks well stor'd with Deer, and the Rivers replenished with Fish, have no Divertisement wanting to recreate their Bodies, and gratifie their Senses.</P>
<P>The first Town of Note we ariv'd at here was <HI>Farnham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Farnham,</NOTE> receiving its Denomination very proba∣bly from the great quantity of <HI>Fern</HI> which grows thereabouts. 'Tis a Town of no very large Extent, but situated in a wholsom Soil, and a pleasant Air; and for its further Accommodation, hath the con∣veniencies of a Market for those Commodities
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>
which the Inhabitants mostly want: Here it was, that in the year 894, saith the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, King <HI>Alfred</HI> routed a great Army of the <HI>Danes,</HI> with a small Party, taking from them a conside∣rable Booty, and putting them to flight to the Ri∣ver <HI>Colne</HI> in <HI>Essex:</HI> After this, when King <HI>Stephen</HI> gave a general Toleration for building Castles and Fortresses, <HI>Henry</HI> his Brother, then Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> built for himself in this place a magnificent Castle, but proving in length a Nursery and Re∣ceptacle for Sedition and Rebellion, King <HI>Henry</HI> III. quite demolish'd and pull'd it down, though af∣terwards it was again Re-edified by the Bishops of <HI>Winchester,</HI> to whom it peculiarly belongs, and is at present a glorious Seat for the Prelates of that See.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Guilford.</NOTE>Passing from hence through <HI>Guilford,</HI> a Town of good Note, seated on the River <HI>Wey,</HI> consist∣ing of three Parishes well frequented, and full of fair Inns, we observ'd here still the Ruines of a large old Castle near the River, and have since learnt, That the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings had formerly a Roy∣al Mansion here, in whose times it was a place of a greater Extent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kingston.</NOTE>Coming after this to <HI>Kingston,</HI> a Market-Town of good Resort, we were inform'd, that it went anciently by the Name of <HI>Moreford,</HI> but after that, chang'd its Name to <HI>Kingston,</HI> when it had the Honour to become a place for the Coronation of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Monarchs; <HI>Athelstan, Edwin,</HI> and <HI>Ethel∣red,</HI> being here Crown'd Kings upon an open Stage in the Market-place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rich∣mond.</NOTE>And now we began to draw near to our Jour∣nies end; but calling in at <HI>Richmond,</HI> heretofore call'd <HI>Sheen,</HI> we found it still a Town of a consi∣derable Account, though perhaps no less in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. who, when he had lived sufficiently both to Glory and Nature, died at this very place. King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. gave it the Name of <HI>Richmond,</HI> from the Title he bore before
<PB N="51" REF="32"/>
he obtain'd the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and ended his Life here, as did after him (here likewise) the most Glorious and Puissant Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>From hence pacing along by the Noble River <HI>Thames,</HI> which is on both sides of it wonderfully graced with many pleasant Towns and Villages, we arriv'd again in safety at the Renown'd Metro∣polis of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF Mr. <HI>BROME'S</HI> Three Years TRAVELS, OVER <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Narrative of his second Journey.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER some few days respite and abode in <HI>London,</HI> we began a new Progress, and passing through <HI>Newington, Totnam-High-Cross,</HI> and <HI>Edmington,</HI> Towns of good Note, by reason of divers Gentlemen, Merchants, and rich Citizens that inhabit there, we came to <HI>Waltham</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> of which County I shall have occasion to speak more fully hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Waltham</HI> was of old a small Village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Waltham <HI>in</HI> Essex.</NOTE> or rather a desolate place beset with Woods and Briars, which one <HI>Tovius</HI> in the declination of the <HI>Saxon</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="35"/>
Empire, a great Courtier, and a very wealthy and potent Man, first Founded, and planted there a Colony of some sixtysix Men; afterwards he de∣ceasing, <HI>Athelstan</HI> his Son was deprived of his Patri∣mony, and <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor bestowed it up∣on <HI>Harold,</HI> a great Favourite of his, who, having taken possession of it, constituted in it a Church of Secular Canons, and Dedicating it to the Honour of the Holy Cross, made his Vows here in hopes of a Victory, when he went to fight against <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> the Conqueror; but <HI>Harold</HI> being slain, and his Army quite routed by the <HI>Normans,</HI> his Body was beg'd by his Mother, of the <HI>Norman</HI> Duke, and buried in this place. After this, the same Ab∣by, in the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> II. was by the King's Command much enlarged, and Regular Canons placed there to the number of Twenty-four, and Dedicated to the Holy Cross and St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> saith the most Ingenious Mr. <HI>Tanner,</HI> in his <HI>Notitia Monastica. Richard</HI> I. still more augmented it, and so did King <HI>Henry</HI> III. with Fairs and Markets, ap∣pointing one Fair in the year to last for seven days together.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hartford∣shire.</NOTE>We staid not long here, and therefore were pre∣sently in <HI>Hartfordshire,</HI> a County every where a∣bounding with fertile Fields, sat Pastures, shady Groves, and pleasant Rivolets; and the first Town here of any Remark, which presented it self to our View, was <HI>Ware,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ware.</NOTE> which was built, say Anti∣quaries, by <HI>Edward</HI> the Senior, King of the West-<HI>Saxons,</HI> about the year 914. 'Tis watered by the River <HI>Ley,</HI> and hath a great Market for all sorts of Grain; it is populous, and well inhabited by per∣sons of very good Quality and lying in the great Road to <HI>London,</HI> frequented constantly by per∣sons of all degrees; and although <HI>Hartford</HI> be the Eye of the County, 'tis now inferiour to this place, since all Passages for Carriages being there ob∣structed during the Barons Wars, were here freely opened to the great Advantage of this Town:
<PB N="57" REF="35"/>
But the most remarkable thing in <HI>Ware</HI> is the New River, or Aquaeduct, convey'd above 20 Miles together in a continued Channel from this place to <HI>Islington,</HI> from whence the Water thereof is disper∣sed in Pipes laid along in the Ground for that pur∣pose into abundance of Streets, Lanes, Courts, and Alleys of the City and Suburbs of <HI>London</HI>; the happy Contrivance whereof all the Citizens have daily Experience, and ought to Immortalize the Name of their Inventor, Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton,</HI> who bestow'd this most excellent Gift upon them, and consummated this good Work so useful and beneficial to the City at his own proper Cost and Charges.</P>
<P>We lay here one Night in the company of some Friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pucke∣ridge <HI>and</HI> Barkway.</NOTE> who came along hither with us for their Diversion; but the next Morning taking a solemn farewell of them, we set forward on our Journey, and passing thro' <HI>Puckeridge,</HI> and <HI>Barkway,</HI> Towns of good Hospitality and Entertainment for Stran∣gers, we were quickly arriv'd within the Precincts of <HI>Cambridgeshire.</HI></P>
<P>This is an extream pleasant open Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cam∣bridge∣shire.</NOTE> and a place of such Variety and Plenty, that fruitful <HI>Geres</HI> with a smiling Countenance, invites the In∣dustrious Peasant to behold with Joy the Fruits of his Labour, whilst she crowns his Industry with a plentiful Harvest; and as if the Earth strove not to be behind hand with him in conferring other Lar∣gesses, she in divers places makes some Annual Ad∣ditions of another Crop, by adorning the Fields with large Productions of Saffron, by which great Profits do continually arise: Besides, here it is that the green Banks of murmuring Rivers, and sunny Hills bedeck'd with diversity of Plants and Simples, call forth the Students from their musing Cells, and teach them Theory as well as Practice, by diving into their Natures, contemplating their Signatures, and considering their Qualities and various Effects. In a word, here is nothing
<PB N="58" REF="36"/>
wanting for Profit or Delight; and though the Northern parts of the County towards the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> lying somewhat low, are moist and Fenny, yet that Defect is abundantly supply'd by the Plen∣ty of Cattle, Fish, and Fowl bred in those Fenns, and which makes the Air more healthy, the gentle Gales which are frequently stirring, drive away all thick Mists and Fogs which in some parts most annoy it; and by this means it is become a fit Seat for the Muses to inhabit, and we have no reason to complain of the Soil, since our Wise Ancestors thought it good and convenient to plant a Colony of Learned Men here, and place one of the Eyes of our Nation in this spot of Ground, the famous and most glorious University of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> which we could not in Honour pass by without a Visit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cam∣bridge.</NOTE><HI>Cambridge</HI> was formerly call'd by the <HI>Britains, Kaergrant,</HI> and <HI>Grantbridge,</HI> from a fair large Bridge made over the River <HI>Grant,</HI> which is now call'd <HI>Cam,</HI> from whence the Town it self receives its Name: It is increased much by the Ruines of <HI>Grantchester,</HI> sometimes a famous City situated a little above a Mile from this place, and the Castle that is beyond the River, the Ruines of which are still to be seen, was built, as ancient Records te∣stifie, in the first year of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror; and in the fifth year of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> in the year of our Lord, 1092, a Nobleman of the <HI>Norman</HI> Blood, nam'd <HI>Picot,</HI> a <HI>Vice-comes,</HI> or <HI>Sheriff,</HI> at the request of <HI>Hugolin</HI> his Wife, founded a Church, and Dedicated it unto St. <HI>Giles</HI> near to this Castle, placing in it a Convent of six black Canons, which was twenty years after remov'd to <HI>Barnwell,</HI> a Vil∣lage near a Mile distant from this place, by <HI>Pain Reverell,</HI> where he built a Priory to the Honour of St. <HI>Giles,</HI> and St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and endow'd it with Re∣venues for the maintainance of thirty Canons of St. <HI>Austin</HI>'s Order: As Mr. <HI>Tanner</HI> informs us.</P>
<P>As to the Antiquity of the University of <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> if any Credit may be given to King <HI>Ar∣thur's
<PB N="59" REF="36"/>
Diploma,</HI> which says, That King <HI>Lucius</HI> was converted by the preaching of the Doctors of <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> for which reason he gave Privileges to that University, which were after confirm'd by King <HI>Arthur</HI>; or if the <HI>Bull</HI> of Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> the First, may be allow'd Authentick, which bearing date, <HI>Feb.</HI> 20: <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 624. makes mention of the Privileges granted to the University of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> by Pope <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> and takes notice of Doctors and Scholars Resident there at that time, Why then as it is truly observ'd by our most Learned Bi∣shop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> in his Antiquities of the <HI>British</HI> Churches: This is a sufficient Proof to all that re∣lie on the Pope's Authority, that in the time of King <HI>Lucius,</HI> and <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> there might be a sufficient number of Learned Men in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to have instructed King <HI>Lucius</HI> in the Christian Faith; and that it is not improbable that <HI>Eluanus</HI> and <HI>Medwinus</HI> might be of that number, especially considering that <HI>Camboritum,</HI> or as many Copies have it, <HI>Camboricum,</HI> was a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, and mention'd amongst the best Copies among the 28 Cities of <HI>Britain,</HI> and that the <HI>Roman</HI> Colonies had their Schools of Learning, wherein the several Professors of Arts and Sciences did instruct both the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>British</HI> Youth. But what ever Fa∣vours the <HI>Romans</HI> were pleased to confer upon this place, 'tis certain, it met afterwards with very great Encouragement from divers other Bene∣factors; and by the Countenance of <HI>Segebert,</HI> King of the East-Angles, and other <HI>Saxon</HI> Princes, it held up its Head in a flourishing Condition, till about the year 1100, as the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle in∣forms us. The cruel and merciless <HI>Danes</HI> laid all waste before them, and <HI>Swene</HI> their King with Fire and Sword, burnt this place to the Ground, con∣trary to what we read of the <HI>Roman</HI> Captain <HI>Sylla,</HI> who, though otherwise as furious as a Tyger, or a Lion; yet when he raged in <HI>Greece,</HI> spared the much celebrated <HI>Athens</HI> for <HI>Minerva</HI>'s sake:
<PB N="60" REF="37"/>
Yet, nevertheless, when these Storms were once blown over, in the time of the <HI>Normans</HI> Learning, began to peep out again, and seeing all was clear and quiet, sprouted up a fresh, recruiting it self by degrees, till at last, in progress of time, it re∣turn'd to its Primitive State, and flourish'd more vigorously than ever it did before: For in the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> I. for his Learning, sirnam'd <HI>Beauclere,</HI> it began again to be new modell'd into an University; and hereupon Religious Houses and Halls were immediately erected, and they have ever since been increasing to the number of Six∣teen, namely, Twelve Magnificent Colleges, and four famous Halls, where the Buildings are so U∣niform, the Chapels so Stately, the Privileges so Great, the Government so Regular, the Orders so Strict, the Ceremonies so Decorous, and the Pre∣ferments so Honourable, that in all the <HI>European</HI> Countries, no, nor perhaps in all the Nations of the World can we find out one University, except∣ing that of <HI>Oxford,</HI> so richly endow'd, so famous and renown'd for its Structures, so admirable for its Discipline, and so courted and address'd to for its most Polite Learning: So that when <HI>Erasmus</HI> was pleased to give us a Strain of his Eloquence, in Decyphering both their Characters, he doth it but in such a Style as is very suitable to the Sub∣ject, and the Elogy is no less than what they justly deserve. I have before this, saith he, been ex∣treamly well satisfy'd, and have exceedingly re∣joyced, that <HI>England</HI> hath constantly been fur∣nish'd with Men, who have been as Eminent for their Parts, as Learning: But now I begin to en∣vy her Felicity, (had he lived now in our days, he would still have had greater reason for this Harangue) by reason that she is now so enrich'd with all kind of Literature, that by taking the Commendation thereof from other Regions, she doth marvellously obscure and eclipse their Glory, and yet this Commendation is not only due to
<PB N="61" REF="37"/>
<HI>England</HI> at this present time, for it is well known for divers years past, to have flourish'd with per∣sons of deep and profound Learning: The Uni∣versities prove this to be true, which have for their Antiquity and Worthiness contended with, and outstripped the most ancient and celebrated Academies, that ever were planted in the Christi∣an World.</P>
<P>It might now be expected that I should further exspatiate into a more particular Description of these Famous and Ample Colleges, and give an exact Portraiture of the large and spatious Qua∣drangle of <HI>Trinity-College,</HI> so excellently contriv'd, and admirably surrounded with a curious Pile of Buildings, which was at first founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.: Of the noble Fabrick of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, founded by <HI>Margaret,</HI> Countess of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Darby,</HI> both which Colleges have of late years been so extreamly beautify'd and enlarg'd: Of <HI>Corpus-Christi,</HI> or <HI>Bennet-College,</HI> founded by <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> whose Library is so famous for its divers ancient Manuscripts, as well as from the great Honour it daily receives from His Grace, the present Lord Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who was formerly a Learned Fellow, and still conti∣nues the greatest Glory of it: Of that unimitable Piece of Architecture in <HI>King</HI>'s-<HI>College</HI> Chapel, founded by that Heroick Prince, King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. Of the Publick Schools of the University, which have been of so ancient a continuance, that there is no mention, when, or how they began: Of the Publick Library, which though it be not so spa∣cious and glorious as the <HI>Vatican,</HI> or <HI>Bodleian,</HI> yet it is so well stock'd with all kind of Divine and Humane Writers, that there is not sufficient Room for all the Manuscripts, and choice Books which are daily given to it, especially if that Order be strictly observ'd, of which I have been credibly inform'd, That a Copy of every Book which is printed in <HI>England,</HI> be by the Printer presented to it.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="38"/>I might insist further on the laudable Modes and Customs which are duly observ'd in this Renown'd University, of the large Privileges and Immunities, which have been ever granted to it, of the ho∣nourable Degrees in Divinity, Law, and Physick, which are here annually conferr'd, of the great Encouragements which are daily given to all such Persons who have been most Exemplary for their Piety and Learning; for which Reason, un∣doubtedly, three great and eminent Persons, the Pious and Humble, Dr. <HI>Sancroft,</HI> the Florid and Rational Preacher, Dr. <HI>Tillotson,</HI> and our present Incomparable Archbishop, whose Stations were all of them first fix'd in this place, have been suc∣cessively advanced in this our present Age, to the Archiepiscopal See of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>But since this would take up a Volume, and re∣quire a much more Polite Pen to accomplish, I shall only crave leave out of a due Honour and Gratitude to <HI>Christ's-College,</HI> of which I had once the happiness to be a Member, to give a more par∣ticular Account of that Society.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's-College.</NOTE><HI>Christ's-College</HI> was first began by K. <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and after his Decease, by the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Countess of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Darby,</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>John,</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and Mother to King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in the place where the College of God's House had stood in the Preacher's Street (founded by Mr. <HI>Will. Bringham,</HI> Parson of St. <HI>John Zachary</HI> in <HI>London</HI>) which College, because it ne∣ver came to perfection, she obtain'd of the said King, her Son, his Charter, to increase the num∣ber of Students, Translating it according to her Pleasure and Discretion. After she had com∣pleated this stately Fabrick, making it Quadran∣gular, and very Uniform; the next thing she ac∣complish'd was the planting in it a Colony of Re∣ligious Men, whom she desired should be all devo∣ted to the Service of God, and Study of Divinity, and their number to be Twelve Fellows under the
<PB N="63" REF="38"/>
Government of a Master. After this, for the better encouraging of Learning, and the enstating of this her College in a flourishing Condition, she gave several Scholarships for the maintenance of poor Students, the number of which to be about Sixty, as preparatives to the better Promotions that might attend their Industry: And that Reli∣gion and Learning might be inseparable Associates she built likewise a Chapel, in which all the Members should meet twice a day, and join una∣nimously in their Devotions, in which there is placed a tunable Organ, for the better promoting of fervent Piety. And because Discipline is ne∣cessary in Bodies Spiritual as well as Civil, for those whose Natures might be so base and disinge∣nuous, as that Rewards could not move or incite them to Virtue, she found out the more rough and harsh ways to enforce them, by inflicting such Penalties, as the very Shame thereof might be Spurs and Goads to their future Reformation; These were all comprized in a Book of Statutes, according to the Rule whereof all Persons, here to be admitted Members, are sworn to square and regulate their Actions. After all things were set∣led in this admirable <HI>Decorum,</HI> this matchless Lady lived for some time in the Buildings her self, which she had designed for the use of the Master, and at her Hours of leisure wrought such curious Work in Hangings with her Needle, some of which are still preserved in the College to this day, that she seems to have been equal to <HI>Minerva</HI> her self, and to have monopoliz'd all Arts as well as Sciences in her Brains, making her Hands as well as Head to give Demonstration of her admirable Perfections, King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, whether by hearing some superstitious Abuses that were put upon the Col∣lege, the Master and the Fellows having by some vain Persons been called Christ and his Twelve Apostles, or whether rather being willing to fol∣low the good Example of this most vertuous Lady,
<PB N="64" REF="39"/>
added another Fellowship, and so made the num∣ber to be Thirteen. And since that by the Muni∣ficence of divers other well-disposed Benefactors, there have been several Donaries conferred upon it both in Exhibitions and Scholar-ship: In pro∣cess of time the House being replenished with Stu∣dents, and so throng'd that the College not be∣ing large enough to receive them all, they were forced to take up Lodgings in the Town. Upon this Consideration to remove all such Inconveni∣encies, and preserve it in a flourishing Condition, divers Persons of Quality of the Black as well as Scarlet Robe, gave large Contributions for the enlarging of it; and by their Liberality there was some Years ago erected a new and far more noble Fabrick than the other, called the New-Building, four Stories high, built of Free-stone, and adorn∣ed with curious Embellishments in the Front, in the midst whereof is a small arch'd Cloyster, and through that a Passage into the Orchard; in which are pleasant Walks, shady Arbours, and secret Re∣cesses for the Fellows to retire to in Summer time: So ready and careful were our Noble Ancestors to gratifie the Muses in every respect, and to suffer them to lack nothing either for Improvement or De∣light. And indeed it hath been the main care and aim of such Persons, who have been admitted Masters or Fellows, by their great Improvements in all sort of Learning, to answer those ends and designs for which they were admitted. And, not to mention several Persons deceased, who having received their first Rudiments here, became after∣ward great Luminaries in the Church, and Co∣lumns in the State: His Grace the present Arch-Bishop of <HI>York</HI> is a sufficient Testimony of this, whose great Learning and exemplary Piety add now at this time no less a Lustre to the Church, than it doth likewise still to this College, where he was formerly a most accomplish'd Member. And as for the present Master, the Worthy Dr. <HI>Covil,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="39"/>
my most Honoured Friend, whom all ingenious Travellers highly court, and all the Learned just∣ly admire; with the rest of the Reverend Fellows, who are now of that Society, there cannot possi∣bly in any respect be greater Ornaments to a Col∣lege, which ever hath had the Honour to enjoy such worthy Persons. For, not to look farther back than a very few Years ago, when this Itinerary was first drawn up, here was a Learned Knot of Professors all concentred in this place, which was not then ob∣servable in any other College besides; the Learn∣ed Dr. <HI>Cudworth,</HI> then Master, was publick Hebrew Professor; the Reverend Dr. <HI>Widdrington,</HI> my Honoured Tutour, from being Publick Orator was made <HI>Margaret Professor</HI>; Dr. <HI>Luke</HI> was Ara∣bick Professor: To whom may be added the Learned Dr. <HI>Henry More,</HI> whom his Philosophical Writings did sufficiently render worthy of that Title. As for what concerns the particular Go∣vernment of the College, we have annually two of the Fellows elected Deans of the Chapel, whose Office is to see that constant Attendance and good Orders be there observed, and due Penalties in∣flicted upon all who presume to absent themselves from Divine Service; and likewise four Readers, one to read Hebrew, two to read Greek Lectures, and one to hear, moderate, and determine all Logical and Philosphical Disputations in Term-time: And for other Offices subservient to these; there is a Manciple, Cook, Butler, Porter, Gar∣diner, with other subordinate Servants for the use of the College.</P>
<P>And thus I have set down a Breviate of the Modes and Orders of this House, from whence it will be easie and natural to guess at the Customs and Constitutions which are in use in all other Colleges, by this short Epitome which hath been given here of this.</P>
<P>But before I take leave of this most flourishing College, I must not forget the Munificence of

some late great Benefactors, who by their generous Liberality to it have erected to themselves a more lasting and durable Monument than the Pyramids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> or the Coloss at <HI>Rhodes</HI>; The one was the Right Reverend and Learned Dr. <HI>Ward,</HI> the late Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who hath founded here four new Scholarships of Ten Pounds a piece <HI>per Annum</HI>; The other Noble Benefactors were the Honourable Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> Brother to the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> sometime Ambassador in <HI>Turkey</HI>; and Sir <HI>Thomas Bayns,</HI> a Physician, his Companion and Fellow-Traveller, sometime here a Student, who at their Death added to the College two more considerable Fellowships and Scholarships, for the due encouragement of Learning, and lie interred in the Chapel, as a signal Testimony of that in∣dissoluble Love and Affection they had always even to the very last, for this Learned Society.</P>
<P>As far the Town of <HI>Cambridge</HI> it self, it is go∣verned by a Mayor, who at the entrance into his Office takes a solemn Oath before the Vice-Chan∣cellor to observe and conserve the Privileges, Li∣berties and Customs of the University; and as the Assizes for the County are for the most part kept here, so 'tis observable that one High Sheriff serves for both the Counties of <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Hunting∣don,</HI> which borders upon it. The chief Market every Saturday supplies it well with Corn, and plenty of other Provision: But nothing is more re∣markable nor advantageous to it, than the great Fair annually kept within a Mile of it in <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI> called by the name of <HI>Sturbridge</HI> Fair;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stur∣bridge-Fair.</NOTE> from whence it received its denomination is uncertain, but this is most certain, that of all Fairs or pub∣lick Marts in <HI>England</HI> 'tis supposed the largest, and best stored with all kind of Wares and Commo∣dities, which the <HI>Londoners</HI> take special care to im∣port hither. When you are within the Limits, you would rather be ready to imagine your self in some great Town, by the variety of Shops and

multiplicity of Booths, than in a wide open Field. Now those Booths are always built for the time in which it lasts, which is about a Fortnight: Nei∣ther are you presented with Booths only upon the Land, but with Booths upon the Water too, there being particular contrivances in their Boats upon the River, which runs hard by this place, for Rooms and secret Retirements, all covered a∣bove for the conveniency of Strangers which re∣sort thither; and indeed here is always a great concourse of People from all parts of the Na∣tion.</P>
<P>Not far from this place appears aloft a certain ridge of Hills called <HI>Hog-magog-Hills,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hog-ma∣gog Hills.</NOTE> fortified of old by the <HI>Danes,</HI> when they infested these Parts, with a threefold Trench, some part whereof is still to be seen.</P>
<P>Having paid our Devoirs, and taken a review of that which affords so great Variety, we at last took our farewell, and bidding it adieu we betook our selves into its Neighbouring County of <HI>Hun∣tingdon</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting∣donshire.</NOTE> 'tis a fruitful Country both for Corn and Grass; towards the East it is waterish and fenny, and hath formerly been well beset with Woods. In the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second it had a large Forest, which he destroyed, con∣verting it to other uses: 'Tis watered by the plea∣sant Rivers <HI>Avon</HI> and <HI>Ouse,</HI> which render it very fertile.</P>
<P>The first Village we arrived at in this County was <HI>Fenny-Stanton,</HI> but found nothing observable till we came to <HI>Godmanchester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Godman∣chester.</NOTE> a great Country Town, and of as great a Name for Tillage, situ∣ate in an open Ground, of a light Mould, and bending for the Sun. Here have been observed more stout and lusty Husbandmen, and more Ploughs agoing, than in any Town besides in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> for they make their boast, that they have in former times receiv'd the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> as they passed it their Progress this way, with Ninescore
<PB N="68" REF="41"/>
Ploughs, brought forth in a rustical kind of Pomp for a gallant Show. Soon after King <HI>James</HI> the First came into <HI>England,</HI> the Bayliffs of this Town presented him with Seventy Teem of Horses all traced to fair new Ploughs, of which when His Majesty demanded the reason, he was answered, That it was their ancient Custom, whensoever any King of <HI>England</HI> passed through their Town so to present him; besides they added, That they held their Lands by that Tenure, being the King's Tenants. His Majesty took it well, and bad them make good use of their Ploughs, being glad he was Landlord of so many good Husband∣men in one Town.</P>
<P>Antiquaries do affirm it to have been formerly a flourishing City, and not only the old <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, which have been digged up here, do at∣test its Antiquity, but its ancient denomination too: It was formerly called <HI>Duroliponte,</HI> corruptly for <HI>Durosiponte,</HI> which in the British Language sig∣nifies a Bridge over the River <HI>Ouse</HI>; but this Name being antiquated in the <HI>Saxons</HI> time, it began to be called <HI>Gormoncester</HI> by <HI>Gormon</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> for King <HI>Alfred</HI> having conquer'd the <HI>Danes,</HI> who had made an Invasion into these Parts, reduced them at last to these Conditions, either forthwith to give him Pledges that they would immediately depart this Land, or else that they would embrace the Christian Religion, which latter Proposal be∣ing made choice of, <HI>Guthrus</HI> or <HI>Gormundus</HI> the <HI>Da∣nish</HI> King with Thirty more of his Nobility was Baptiz'd into the Christian Faith, and their Prince adopted by <HI>Alfred</HI> for his Son, who changing his Name to <HI>Athelstan</HI> appointed him his Station here, and committed the Provinces of the <HI>East-Angles</HI> and <HI>Northumbers</HI> to his peculiar Charge: And if it be likewise allowed that one <HI>Machutus</HI> was here Bishop, when it was called <HI>Gumica∣strum, hou! quantum mutatur!</HI> 'Tis certainly now reduced to a poor and despicable Condition, to

what it could then glory of in former Genera∣tions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting∣don.</NOTE><HI>Huntingdon</HI> is about a Mile distant from this place, and is the chief Town of the County, situ∣ate upon the River <HI>Ouse,</HI> over which stands a Bridge made of Stone, which gives entrance in∣to it; the Houses are fair, and the Streets large; 'tis adorn'd with Four Churches, and had former∣ly a Benedictine Nunnery dedicated to St. <HI>James,</HI> saith the <HI>Notitia Monastica,</HI> and a Priory of Black Canons founded about the Year 1140, to the ho∣nour of St. <HI>Mary,</HI> by <HI>Eustace de Luvetot</HI>; some of the Ruins whereof are still to be seen. Near the River, upon a high Hill, stands the remains of a Castle, which was built about the Year of Christ 917, by <HI>Edward</HI> the Senior: Afterwards <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> waging War against King <HI>Stephen,</HI> upon the account of <HI>Mawd</HI> the Empress, who was his Neice, this was surrendred upon some certain Conditions to the <HI>Scots</HI> King, who did exceeding∣ly beautifie and strengthen it, by making strong Rampires and Fortifications about it, but <HI>Henry</HI> the Second finding it in process of time a Cage on∣ly for Rebels and Ringleaders of Sedition, at last quite demolished it; and from the top of this Hill is a very pleasant Prospect for the space of some Miles. The Town, which is supposed to have been the Daughter of <HI>Godmanchester,</HI> is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen, and the Assizes are held here twice a Year for the Shire, and wants no kind of Provision to entertain Travellers, who much resort hither out of the Northern Parts, the great Road to the City of <HI>London</HI> lying through it.</P>
<P>In this Town in the Year 1599 was that Usur∣per and Religious Cheat <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> born and educated, whom tho' we have some just Reasons to curse in his very Name, and detest his Memo∣ry as odious and execrable, yet since prosperous Successes of the most cruel Tyrants makes others

inquisitive after those Persons, which they did so fortunately attend; it will not be amiss to tell the World, that this place gave him his first being, who, exceeding <HI>Nero</HI> in Cruelty, de∣stroyed his Father and Mother too, the Father of his Country, and his Country likewise, be∣ing a Murderer of the one, and a Plague to the other; who was of so unparallell'd and base a temper of Mind from his Cradle to his Grave, that nothing could stay with him, or be pleasing to him long, but what even carried the World before it, Confusion and Ruine.</P>
<P>From hence we passed directly into the pleasant County of <HI>Northampton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">North∣ampton∣shire.</NOTE> where the Air is tempe∣rate, the Soil rich, fruitful and Champaign, and having less waste Ground than any other County, withal so populous and well replenished with Towns, that in many places 20 or 30 Steeples present themselves at one view; nor is there per∣haps a County, which within that compass of Ground, can shew more Noblemens and Gentle∣mens Seats: For in all the dispersed Villages of this Country it is observed, that there are fixed several bright and coruscant Luminaries shining in this Orb, of whose influence the Peasantry are continually sensible, feeling divers good Effects and enlivening Operations from their Vicinity. For whilst the Noblemen and Persons of Supe∣riour Ranks transplant themselves hither, and fix in this Soil, the Commonalty are quickly invigo∣rated with the warmth which they communicate, whilst all Trades flourish more by those Encourage∣ments they afford them, and the poor Tenant is en∣abled thro' their Assistance to discharge all Rents with greater Improvement, both to their Landlords and themselves, they being like the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> which put all the other Orbs into a continued mo∣tion, or the Wheels in a Machine, which make the whole Engine move very regularly, which otherwise would be altogether useless and unser∣uisable.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="42"/><HI>Thrapston</HI> is Twelve Miles distant from <HI>Hun∣tingdon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thrap∣ston-</NOTE> which being the first Market Town we arrived at here, well stored with Inns, and reple∣nished with all sorts of Grain, we went from thence to another Town called <HI>Kettering,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kettering</NOTE> which has been of much more Note than its Neighbours, by reason of a handsom Cross formerly beautified with divers Images of Christ and his Apostles, very curiously and artificially carved. And the next place of consequence is <HI>Higham-Ferries,</HI> the excellent Ornament of which place was formerly <HI>Henry Chicheley,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who built <HI>All-Souls</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and another here (<HI>Temp.

<P>But that which is the Ornament of the County is <HI>Northampton</HI> it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">North∣ampton.</NOTE> a Town pleasantly seated on the River <HI>Nen,</HI> where it meets with two Rivulets, one North and the other South. This Town, as many others, fell under the Fury of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who burnt it to Ashes. In the Reign of King <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> the Abby of St. <HI>Mary de Pratis</HI> for Cluniac Nuns was Founded here by <HI>Simon de Senilitz</HI> II. Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI>: And an Abby of Black Ca∣nons was built to the Honour of St. <HI>James.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the First was a good Benefactor, keep∣ing his Court here in <HI>Lent,</HI> as the <HI>Saxon Annals</HI> tell us, in the Year 1106, and again at <HI>Easter</HI> in the Year 1122; but in the Reign of King <HI>John</HI> it suffered exceedingly by the Barons Wars. In his Successor <HI>Henry</HI> the Third's time, the Students of <HI>Cambridge</HI> are reported to have removed hither by the King's Warrant, in order to settle the U∣niversity here, where <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth had the fate to be overthrown, and taken Prisoner by his Rival for the Crown, <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth. In the Year 1675, <HI>Sept.</HI> 3. this Town was reduced to Ashes by a general Conflagration, but by the As∣sistance

and Contributions of Charitable People, it is once more restored to greater Magnificenco and Beauty, than it ever yet before enjoyed; 'tis govern'd by a Mayor, and is the place where the County Gaol and Assizes are generally held.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War∣wickshire.</NOTE>Our next Remove was into <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> which, as it is situated almost in the very Heart of the Kingdom, is very free from the frequent Vapours, that annoy many other places, and therefore is justly celebrated for its Health as well as Fruitful∣ness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwick.</NOTE><HI>Warwick</HI> is the principal Town of the whole Shire, it stands on the West side of the River <HI>Avon,</HI> over which it hath a strong Stone-Bridge, and consists of two Parishes; 'tis seated in a dry and a fertile Soil, having the benefit of rich and plea∣sant Meadows on the South part, with lofty Groves, and spacious Thickets of Woodland on the North; the Town has not long since suffer'd extreamly by Fire; but 'tis to be hoped it will in a little time, return again to its ancient Splendour and Renown; the chief Beauty of it is its Castle, the Seat, in times past, of the Earls of <HI>Warwick,</HI> mounted aloft upon a steep and a craggy Rock. The Collegiate Church of St. <HI>Mary</HI> was endow'd by <HI>Roger,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> A.

Stream, runs not far from thence into the <HI>A∣von.</HI> It is a City very commodiously Seated, large, sweet, and neat, was formerly fortified with a very strong Wall, and is set out and adorn∣ed with right goodly Houses, amongst which there rise up on high, two spacious Churches, no∣ted for their Loftiness, and the Cross for its Work∣manship, standing one hard by the other, and matched (as it were) as Concurrents, one Con∣secrated to the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> the other to St. <HI>Mi∣chael,</HI> a Town that injoys a good Inland Trade by the Cloth here made, and vended, which makes it Populous and Rich; the same is a Bishop's See joyn'd with <HI>Litchfield,</HI> to which it was united by <HI>Hugo Novant,</HI> about the latter end of the Twelfth Century. <HI>Leofrick,</HI> Earl of <HI>Mercia,</HI> about the year 1050, built an Abby here for black Monks, to the Honour of the Blessed Virgin. <HI>Rob. de Limesie,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> removed his Seat hi∣ther, (Temp. <HI>Hen.</HI> 1.) one of whose Successors expell'd the Monks, and placed Secular Canons in their Room, A. D. 1191. but seven years after the Monks were restored. The same <HI>Leofrick,</HI> the first Lord of this City, being much offended, and angry with the Citizens, oppressed them with most heavy Tributes, which he would remit up∣on no other Condition, at the earnest Suit of his Wife <HI>Godina,</HI> unless she would her self ride on Horseback Naked through the greatest and most inhabited Street of the City, which she did in∣deed, being covered only with her fair long Hair: Also a Proclamation was Published, Command∣ing all People to keep close within their Houses, to shut their Doors and Windows, and no Person, on Pain of Death, to appear in that Street where she Rode, nor so much as to look into it, whether out of a Window, or otherwise: Upon which, as she was Riding along Naked, one Man more cu∣rious than ordinary, ventures to peep out of a Garret Window, and being immediately disco∣ver'd,

was apprehended and hang'd; as by the Effigies of a Man doth appear, that is continually kept up for a Memorandum, in a full proportion looking out of a Garret Window, and call'd by the Inhabitants, <HI>Peeping Jack.</HI> And thus did she free her Citizens of <HI>Coventry</HI> from any such further rigorous Payments.</P>

That part which lies on the Southside of the Water, is much the greater, and divided into several Streets. It hath been, doubtless, a place of very great Anti∣quity, for we read, That <HI>Oswy,</HI> King of the <HI>Northumbers,</HI> A. D. 656, built a Cathedral-Church, and placed here a Bishop, (call'd <HI>Dui∣ma</HI>) for the Kingdom of <HI>Mercia</HI>; and the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Angl. Sacr Pars pri∣ma, <HI>p.</HI> 423.</NOTE> That in the year 716, <HI>Ceolred</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians</HI> died, and was buried in this place. King <HI>Ossa,</HI> about A.

<PB N="75" REF="44"/>
restored and augmented the Chapter; and now this City, and <HI>Coventry</HI> with it, make up but one Diocess under a double Name, which came to pass after the same manner, and much about the same time as <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI> were joyn'd together into one Bishoprick. When this Town in the late un∣happy <HI>Civil Wars</HI> fell into a state of Suffering, the Cathedral at that time was a Fellow-sharer with it, and through the insatiable Malice of some ill Wishers to it, it became a Sacrifice to their merci∣less Fury; but since the happy Restauration, through the indefatigable Zeal, and boundless Charity of Bishop <HI>Hacket,</HI> and other noble and generous Benefactors, it has began again to revive out of its own Ashes, and to retrieve its Primitive Splendour and Beauty, mounting up aloft with three Pyramids of Stone, which make a lovely shew; and for elegant and proportionable Build∣ings, will in due time, it is to be hoped, equal some other Cathedrals.</P>
<P>The next County we visited, was <HI>Leicestershire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leicester∣shire.</NOTE> which, though in very many parts is deep and Miry, yet the richness of the Soil doth sufficient∣ly compensate for the unpleasantness of the Roads, which is generally fruitful with all sorts of Grain, especially Pease and Beans, of which there are so great Stacks, that they cover the Fields with their infinite Numbers, and what is wanting in Wood, is supply'd by their Coal-Mines, which they have in great abundance.</P>

<PB N="76" REF="45"/>
been a Bishop See, about the year 680, and that <HI>Sexwulphus</HI> was first installed in the Episcopal Chair, at the Command of <HI>Ethelred,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> which continued not long; in 914. <HI>Ethelfleda,</HI> a noble and discreet Lady, Rebuilt it, and surrounded it with Walls; after which, in the time of the <HI>Normans,</HI> it flourished exceedingly, and Temp. <HI>Henry</HI> I. <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> foun∣ded a College of a Dean, and Twelve Prebenda∣ries, the Church of St. <HI>Marys the less,</HI> in the Castle. But Crouch-back <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl hereof, having raised a Rebellion against King <HI>Henry</HI> II. the Town was Besieged, and taken, and the Castle quite dismant∣led; hard by which there is a fair, though anci∣ent Hospital, in the Chapel whereof, <HI>Henry,</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> his Son, the first Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> lie Interr'd, which Duke being very A∣ged, and willing to give some visible Testimony of his Charity, built this Hospital for the use and Maintainance of divers poor, aged decrepit Per∣sons of both Sexes; and on the other side amongst those flowry Meadows, which the River <HI>Soar</HI> en∣richeth with its bubling Streams, <HI>Robert Bossu,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> built an Abby of Canons Regular of St. <HI>Austin</HI>'s Order to the Honour of the Assump∣tion of the Blessed Virgin, of which Order, by the consent of his Wife <HI>Amicia,</HI> he became him∣self the chief Canon, and lived in this place Fif∣teen years a Monk, as hoping to atone for some of his former Crimes, by taking upon him this Religious Habit. Here <HI>Richard</HI> III. was obscurely Interr'd, after that fatal Battle at <HI>Bosworth</HI> before∣mention'd, and so was the great Cardinal <HI>Woolsey,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. Reign.

<P>Not far from hence is <HI>Carleton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carleton.</NOTE> of which we were told, that most Persons that are born there, whether it be by a peculiar property of the Soil, or of the Water, or else by some other secret O∣peration of Nature, have an ill favoured untu∣nable, and harsh manner of Speech, fetching their words with very much ado, deep from out of the Throat, with a certain kind of wharling, the Letter R being very irksome and troublesome to them to pronounce.</P>
<P>Having rested at <HI>Leicester</HI> one Night, and made

a visit to some Friends and Relations, who were seated in this place, the next day we took our leaves both of them and that place, and began a further Progress into the County, and having rode four or five Miles further, we came to ano∣ther Market-Town, call'd <HI>Mount-Sorrel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount-Sorrel.</NOTE> so called from a high Mount situated in the middle of the Town.

<P>Four Miles further, is another Market-Town, call'd <HI>Loughborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Loughbo∣rough.</NOTE> some will have this to be the Village that <HI>Cuthwulphus</HI> took from the <HI>Britains,</HI> a∣bout the year 571, for the <HI>Saxon</HI> Name <HI>Lygean∣burh</HI> is of very near Affinity to it; but the Opini∣on of my Learned Friend, Mr. <HI>Gibson,</HI> seems much more probable, who, in his Explication of this place, at the end of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, tells us, that it rather seems to point at <HI>Leighton,</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> for after <HI>Cuthwulphus</HI> had taken <HI>Ly∣geanburh,</HI> he is reported likewise to have taken <HI>Egelesburgh,</HI> i. e. <HI>Alisbury,</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> and <HI>Bennington,</HI> now <HI>Bensington,</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and that the Road leads directly from <HI>Leighton</HI> to <HI>Alis∣bury,</HI>

and so to <HI>Bensington</HI>; but 'tis very improba∣ble that <HI>Cuthwulphus</HI> should so order his Marches to pass from <HI>Loughborough</HI> to <HI>Alisbury,</HI> and yet take no other place in all that long March of his betwixt those two places, which are so far distant from one another: This hath been formerly reputed the second Town in this County, both for its fair Buildings, and the pleasantness of its Situation, being near unto the Forest of <HI>Charnwood,</HI> and se∣veral shady Woods, and delightful Groves that lie about it, but of late Years this hath likewise undergone great Calamities from the sudden irrup∣tions of Fire, and hath been almost quite destroy∣ed by this merciless Element.</P>
<P>And here again having been generously enter∣tain'd by some particular Friends in these Parts, after some returns of Thanks for their great civi∣lity and kindness, we quickly arrived within the County of <HI>Nottingham.</HI></P>
<P>And because according to the great Orator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notting∣hamshire.</NOTE> <HI>Non nobis solum nati sed Patriae,</HI> every one is obliged to be serviceable to his Country proportionable to his Abilities, and every one hath a natural Propen∣sion to love that Native Soil, which first gave him a Being, I cannot but in Duty pay some acknow∣ledgments of the Benefits I have received herein, both for my Nativity, and first Rudiments of E∣ducation: And indeed, I may justly say, without any partiality, that it is a Province not much in∣ferior to any in <HI>England,</HI> being divided into two Parts, the one whereof is called the Sand, the o∣ther the Clay, but both sufficiently productive of all things necessary for Mankind. If we will take the pains to course over the Valleys, we shall find the Earth groaning under the heavy burdens of bountiful <HI>Ceres,</HI> and the Fields and Meadows in a careful contest which should appear most trim and glorious. If we will range the Woods and Fo∣rests, we shall hear such Melodies by the mutual reciprocation of Birds and Trees, that one would
<PB N="80" REF="47"/>
think they had got the knack of speaking, and <HI>Do∣dona</HI>'s pratling Groves were become visible to us: If we be so curious to dig into the Entrails of the Earth, and take a view of her hidden Treasures, we shall find several Minerals to gratifie our Cu∣riosity, several great Quarries of Stone, divers Mines of Coal to provide us with Fuel against the blustring Storms of Winter. If we be taken with the gentle Streams of Brooks and Rivers, <HI>Trent</HI> will not be wanting to satisfie our Desires, and will afford us, as is reported, thirty kinds of Fish to please our Palates. As for the Towns and Vil∣lages they are well inhabited with industrious Tradesmen and laborious Peasants, and so 'tis po∣pulous, the Edifices of Nobles and Gentlemen are thick and spacious, and so 'tis Honourable; the Churches fair and Uniform, and so 'tis glorious; and in fine, the Air clear and serene, and so 'tis salubrious. And to begin with that Town, which being the principal of all, gives a Denomination to the whole County, even that alone will be suf∣ficient to set forth, and demonstrate the great Lu∣stre and Symmetry of all the other Parts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Notting∣ham, <HI>by the</HI> Bri∣tains <HI>call∣ed</HI> Caer-Snotyn∣ham.</NOTE><HI>Nottingham</HI> is built upon a Rock, and is envi∣ron'd with Rocks on one side, which are washed by the crooked Windings of a commodious River, hath a fair Park of the Duke of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s ad∣joining to it, with <HI>Sherwood</HI> Forest bordering upon it. The Streets are large and well paved, the Market-place handsom and convenient, the Chur∣ches spacious and usefully contrived, and the Houses high and stately, they are for the most part built with Brick, but some of them are rare pieces, as well for Structure as Design; and in short, the whole front of their Fabrick is beauti∣fied with Sculptures, and glistering Balconies, the Inhabitants being very curious in the new Modes and Draughts of Architecture. The Castle which is on the West-side of the Town being si∣tuated upon an exceeding high Rock, did former∣ly
<PB N="81" REF="47"/>
for strength, prospect and stateliness, challenge the precedency of most Castles in the Kingdom. And here the <HI>Danes</HI> held out a very long Siege against three Kings united against them. For in the Year 868, <HI>Buthred</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians</HI> sent Ambassadors to <HI>Aethelred</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> and <HI>Alfred</HI> his Brother to crave their Aid and As∣sistance against the <HI>Danish</HI> Army, which they ac∣cordingly obtained, for the two Brothers muster∣ing up a considerable Army arrived in the King∣dom of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and made no stop till they came to <HI>Snotenghaham,</HI> now <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and when the Pagans confiding in their Fortress refused to give Battel, and the Christians had then no Engines to batter or rase the Walls, the <HI>Mercians</HI> were en∣forced to conclude a Peace with the Pagans, and the two Brothers to return home ingloriously with∣out doing any feats. After this, saith the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, in the Year 942, the most Valiant and Puissant King <HI>Edmund</HI> not only rescued this place out of its <HI>Danish</HI> Bondage, but four other Cities, <HI>Lincoln</HI> and <HI>Leicester, Stamford</HI> and <HI>Darby,</HI> were by the same victorious Hand delivered from the Shackles and Oppressions of those most bloody Infidels. In process of time King <HI>Edward</HI> the Se∣nior strengthened it with Walls; and a new Ca∣stle was built by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth enlarged it with various dwelling Houses for Commanders and Soldiers, and in the Rock upon which the Castle stands are several small Cottages hewn out of it, in which at pre∣sent dwell divers poor People: And it is report∣ed that it was never taken until by a subtil Stra∣tagem it was surprized by <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Darby</HI> in the Barons Wars, who having once got this soon entred the Town, and then used the Townsmen according to his pleasure. Though I find too in the Life of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> that <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glou∣cester</HI> invaded this Town with a great Power, and when most of the Townsmen were slain or burnt
<PB N="82" REF="48"/>
in the Churches, whither they fled for Refuge. There is a Story of one of them, which was richer than the rest, that being forced to return to his own House by the Soldiers that had taken him, to shew them where his Treasure lay, he bringing them into a Cellar, whilst they were bu∣sie in breaking open Locks and Coffers, convey'd himself away, and shutting the Doors after him set fire on the House, and so the Soldiers, being 30 in number, perished in the Flames, which catching hold of other Buildings joining to it, al∣most burnt up the whole Town. But that which makes this Castle most signally remarkable, was the discovery of the secret Amours of <HI>Roger Mor∣timer</HI> Earl of <HI>March,</HI> and the Imprisonment of <HI>David Bruce</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> the Relation of which I shall set down as briefly as I can.</P>
<P>After King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second had been Depo∣sed and Murthered by the Contrivances and Plots of his own Wife Queen <HI>Isabella,</HI> and King <HI>Edward</HI> her Son had Reigned about Four Years, a Parlia∣ment was called at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> where this <HI>Roger Mortimer,</HI> who was the Queen's most especial Fa∣vourite, was in such Glory and Renown, that it was beyond all Comparison; none so much Lord Paramount as the Earl of <HI>March,</HI> none appears in so great an Equipage, and attended with so ho∣nourable a Retinue as the Earl of <HI>March,</HI> so that the King's Train was inferiour to his, and his Ma∣jesty's Glory eclipsed by the Pomp and Grandeur of one of his Nobles; for he very often would presume to go foremost with his own Officers, and was so exceeding proud and haughty, as to make all Persons cringe and do as great Homage to him as to Majesty it self: Nay he undertook to order and dispose of all Persons and Affairs ac∣cording to his own Will and Pleasure; and here∣upon he one day rebuked the Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the King's Cousin, for presuming to appoint Lodgings for certain Noblemen near the Court
<PB N="83" REF="48"/>
without his particular License and Assignation, and having dislodged the Earl with some other Persons of very great Quality, and removed them a Mile out of Town: He did by this means so in∣cense the Nobility against him, that they began to pry more narrowly into his Actions, and being enraged to see his Pride and his Usurpation of such great Prerogatives, they unanimously Libelled a∣gainst him, and gave it out amongst the People; that this <HI>Mortimer</HI> was the Queen's Gallant, and the King's Master, and sought by all means he possibly could to destroy the Royal Blood, and Usurp the Crown, which report did so work upon some of the King's most trusty Friends, that they got <HI>Robert Holland,</HI> who had a long time been Governour of the Castle, and knew well all the secret Corners therein, to swear Secrecy to them, and Fidelity to the King, and accordingly to assist them in those Designs they had in hand: Whereupon one Night King <HI>Edward</HI> lying with∣out the Castle, both he and his Friends were brought by Torch-light through a secret Place under the ground, beginning afar off from the said Castle ('tis the Vault which is still call'd <HI>Mortimer</HI>'s Hole) till they came even to the Queen's Cham∣ber, which by chance they found open, being Arm'd with naked Swords in they rush'd, leaving the King in the same posture at the Door; when they had entred into the Privy-Chamber, they found the Earl of <HI>March</HI> undressed, ready to go to Bed to the Queen; but they crossed his Design, and cooled his Courage, halling him away im∣mediately by force, upon which the Queen cried out in French, <HI>Good Son, take Pity of Gentle</HI> Mor∣timer, suspecting her Son to have been in the Company: The Keys of the Castle were present∣ly called for, and every Place with all the Furni∣ture committed into the King's Hands, and <HI>Mor∣timer</HI> was forthwith sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> who being Tryed by his Peers, Arraign'd and found Guilty,
<PB N="84" REF="49"/>
was hang'd upon the common Gallows two Days and two Nights.</P>
<P>The Articles that were brought against him were divers, though his too great Familiarity with the Queen, his unpardonable Treachery to the King, and his secret Services to <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> were the chief, having burnt the very Charters by which the <HI>Scotch</HI> King stood obliged to do Ho∣mage to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and thereupon en∣sued a great War betwixt them; for King <HI>David</HI> being spurred on by the <HI>French</HI> King invaded <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and having made a great Inroad into the Northern Counties, spoiling and burning all Pla∣ces as he came along; at length at <HI>Durham</HI> his Army was routed, and himself taken Prisoner; being first sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> afterwards committed to this Castle, where during his Confinement he engraved upon the Walls of his Apartment the History of our Blessed Saviour's Death and Passion, some of the Relicts of which are still there to be seen. After Eleven Years Imprisonment he was restored again to his Kingdom, by paying a good Ransom for his Liberty; but before he returned, he was one of the Four Kings that was nobly treated by <HI>Henry Picard,</HI> a Vintner, then Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and the King of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> together with <HI>Edward</HI> the Black Prince, all bearing him Company at the same Table. This was about the Year 1358.</P>
<P>But before I leave this Town, I cannot but take notice of one thing more memorable in our Age, this being the first place where King <HI>Charles</HI> the First set up his Royal Standard against the Rebels in the late unhappy Wars; and when the King's Forces were forced to leave it, the Castle was then quite demolished, but of late it hath been curiously rebuilt, beautified and furnished by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="49"/>Having pleasured our selves with the Antiquities of this Town, we took Horse and went to visit the Well and ancient Chair of <HI>Robin Hood,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Robin Hood</HI>'s Well and Chair in <HI>Sherwood</HI> Forest.</NOTE> which is not far from hence, within the Forest of <HI>Sher∣wood:</HI> Being placed in the Chair, we had a Cap, which they say was his, very formally put upon our Heads, and having perform'd the usual Cere∣monies befitting so great a Solemnity, we receiv'd the freedom of the Chair, and were incorporated into the Society of that Renowned Brotherhood. But that we may not receive such Privileges with∣out an honourable mentioning of the Persons that left them to Posterity, know we must that the Patent was bequeathed to the inferiour Rangers of this Forest by <HI>Robin Hood</HI> and Little <HI>John,</HI> honourable Personages indeed, being the chief Lords of some most Renowned Robbers in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, who descended from good Families, as some averr, but having wasted their Estates, betook themselves afterward to such profligate Courses. This same <HI>Robin Hood</HI> entertained One hundred tall Men, all good Ar∣chers, with the Spoil he daily made himself Ma∣ster of, upon whom Four hundred, though very well accoutred to give Battel, durst scarce make an Onset: He suffered no Woman to be violated, oppressed, or any ways molested, poor Mens Goods he spared, and did relieve the necessitous very liberally with what he got from rich Carls and Misers, he killed none willfully, and by this means he did for a long time keep up the Order of his Knight Errants, till King <HI>Richard</HI> issuing out a Proclamation to apprehend him, it happened that he fell sick at a certain <HI>Benedictine</HI> Nunnery in <HI>York∣shire,</HI> called <HI>Kirkeley,</HI> (built by <HI>Reynerus Flandrensis</HI> to the Honour of the Blessed Virgin) where being desirous to be let Blood, he was betrayed, and made bleed to Death.</P>
<P>Having for some short time pleased our selves with our new Fraternity, we equipped again for
<PB N="86" REF="50"/>
a Journey, and proceeded to find out new Ad∣ventures.</P>
<P>We travelled over the wide and desolate Forest of <HI>Sherwood</HI> for several Miles together, but met with no place of any Note till we arrived at <HI>Al∣fretton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alfret∣ton.</NOTE> a Town within the Precincts of <HI>Darby∣shire</HI>; 'tis a Market-Town, and of considerable Antiquity, being supposed first to have shewn its Head in the time of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and to have re∣ceived its primary rise from the Noble and He∣roick King <HI>Alfred.</HI> The Inhabitants here, as in divers other places of this County, make a sort of Liquor which they call Ale, which is very strong and nappy, which as it hath been the old drink of <HI>England,</HI> coming from the <HI>Danish</HI> word <HI>Oela,</HI> so questionless in it self it is a very wholesom and sound sort of Drink, and therefore however it plea∣sed a Poet in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, thus to descant on it:
<Q><L>Nescio quid monstrum Stygiae conforme paludi</L>
<L>Cervisiam plerique vocant, nil spissius illa</L>
<L>Dum bibitur, nil clarius est dum mingitur, ergo</L>
<L>Constat quod multas feces in ventre relinquit.</L></Q></P>
<P>In <HI>English</HI> thus;
<Q><L>Of this strange Drink, so like the <HI>Stygian</HI> Lake</L>
<L>Men call it Ale, I know not what to make;</L>
<L>Folk drink it thick, and piss it very thin,</L>
<L>Therefore much Dregs must needs remain within.</L></Q></P>
<P>I think it not amiss to invert a little his Stan∣za's in the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> the Third, thus,
<Q><L>Nescio quid Stygiae monstrum conforme paludi</L>
<L>Cervisiam plerique vocant, nil spissius unquam</L>
<L>Quam caput illius qui sic depinxerat, unde</L>
<L>Constat quod saeces, quia non epota, reliquit.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="50"/>In <HI>English</HI> again thus;
<Q><L>They that will have our Ale so like the Lake</L>
<L>Of <HI>Styx,</HI> I know not what of them to make;</L>
<L>Their Skulls are thick, nor can be rinsed clear</L>
<L>If Ale ben't drank, but dregs will still appear.</L></Q></P>
<P>After a little pause we rode on two or three Miles further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Darby∣shire.</NOTE> till we came into the edge of those wide and dangerous Moors, which extend many Miles both in length and breadth throughout this County, where being several Bogs and dangerous Rocks, which do much annoy the Roads that lie through them, and the Roads themselves very cross and irksom to Strangers, we resolved to take a Guide to conduct us safe over them; and the Guide we happened to make choice of was a plain but sensible Peasant, going homeward with his Cart loaded with Stones; the poor Man rea∣dily complied with our Proposals, whereupon taking a Horse out of his own Team, and leaving the rest to graze thereabouts till his return, our Pilot began to steer forward: As we rode along we became very inquisitive after the nature of the Soil, and the modes of the Country, of which our Guide gave us the best account which he could. The Country, saith he, Eastward is fruitful and pleasant, abounding with all sorts of Grain, but more particularly with Barley, which makes ma∣ny of the Inhabitants considerable Maltsters; but the Western, into which we are now entring, and is commonly called the <HI>Peak,</HI> is Mountainous, as you see, and Rocky, though Nature makes a sufficient amends for the Barrenness of the Soil by her hidden Treasures, which are here frequently discovered. Its length from North to South is about 30 Miles, and its breadth about 20, and the Moors, upon which we now are, are of an un∣known Longitude running along, they say, to the very Borders of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and having divers Names
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>
answerable to the places through which they are extended, out of which divers Rivolets have like∣wise their Source and Original, who pay all their little Tributes to the more noble River of <HI>Trent,</HI> which receiving all their petty Homages, makes at last an acknowledgment of its Royalty to the Ocean. The River <HI>Derwent</HI> divides the County into two Portions, and in that part, which you are now going to view, you will meet with very strange and wonderful Curiosities.</P>
<P>As for we poor Folk that live here about these <HI>Moors,</HI> and in these parts, we make a shift to live, but it is hardly, and if any eat their Bread in the sweat of their Brows it is we; and we seem to be in a continual quarrel with the Earth, that first gave us a Being, for we are continually opening her Veins, and for Anger, eating even into her very Bowels; some of us are employed in the Quarrys for Mill, and Whet-stones, and in some places to dig Marble and Alabaster out of the Earth: Others are set to look for Antimony, or to dig for Leaden Oar, and after with great diffi∣culty, sometimes, with the loss of their Limbs, they have got it up from the Mines, they are for∣ced to hazard the rest by their indefatigable La∣bour, before they can melt, and shape it into Pigs and Sows. Others you will meet with, who by the blackness and grimness of their Visage, you would imagine to have come out lately from some of the Infernal Regions, these are they who work in the Coal-Mines, who, indeed, one would think, by reason of the darkness and dismalness of the Abyss in which they work, should thereby be frequently put in mind of the more dreadful Abyss, even of Hell it self; but they, as well as most other Mi∣ners, as they are excluded often from the least Glimmerings of Lights so they are not terrified with any approaching Shades of Darkness, which makes them generally such insensate Wretches as they are.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="51"/>The Character this Man gave us of these Inha∣bitants, was as strange and uncommon, and he had just ended his Discourse, when we Rode by a piece of Ground, which was all inclosed with Stone: We asked him the meaning of it, standing so a∣lone without any other Inclosures near it, who replied, that it was customary to inclose some of their Grounds after this manner, Wood and Bu∣shes here to make Hedges with, being a very scarce Commodity, and yet that all Hunters who there pursued their Game never baulked them in the least, but made their way over them with great facility, which the next day we found true, for meeting some Gentlemen in a warm Chase after a Hare, we observ'd them to Course nimbly with their light Gennets in those places, where we durst scarce Trot, and at last poor Puss to be∣come the Prey of the unwearied Pursuers. Ha∣ving pass'd this Inclosure, we came to the top of a high Hill, where lighting, and walking down by reason of the steepness of the Descent, at the bottom we found a little Village; and being thus safely got off from the Moors, we took leave of our Guide, and riding two Miles further, we ar∣riv'd at last at our designed Stage.</P>
<P>And took up our Inn at <HI>Bakewell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bakewell.</NOTE> which was made a Borough by <HI>Edward</HI> the Senior; it was called by the <HI>Saxons, Badecanwylla,</HI> in whose Neighbourhood, saith the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, in the year 924, King <HI>Edward</HI> Commanded a City to be built, and a Cittadel for the Defence of it 'Tis a Market-Town much resorted to by the Inhabitants of the <HI>Peak,</HI> (which by the <HI>Saxons</HI> was formerly called <HI>Peaclond</HI>) and found it a place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven Won∣ders of the <HI>Peak.</HI></NOTE> from whence we might very appositely ac∣complish those designs we had proposed to our selves, of viewing the seven Wonders, which are here so famous, whereupon fitting our selves again with a Guide, we set out for the prospect of such celebrated Varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="52"/>When we were got about two Miles from that Town, we observed upon the top of a Hill, a particular piece of Ground, which was of a strange Nature, as our Guide inform'd us. It was a Field, on which, for the most part, there was very good Grass, which, within the space of a Month, would either Fat, or kill any Horse that was put into it. As we Rode on, we found our first Pilot's Description in most points truly verifi∣ed, for we met divers Horses loaden with Lead and Coals, and were frequently surrounded as well with plenty of Leaden Mines, as Quarrys of Stone, and Coals, till at last we arrived at the Castle in the <HI>Peak,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle in the <HI>Peak.</HI></NOTE> which is eight or nine Miles from <HI>Bakewell</HI>; 'tis of great Antiquity by its Ru∣ines, and seems to have been impregnable by its Situation upon a high and dangerous Rock, which is so steep, and craggy, that there appears but one way, by which there is any access to it.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the Hill, which is near two Miles in the Descent, by reason of its steepness and frequent windings, stands a Village, call'd <HI>Castleton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Castleton.</NOTE> sufficiently noted for that wide subterra∣neous Cavern, known commonly by the Name of the <HI>Devil's Arse</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Devils Arse.</NOTE> it runs under this Hill upon which the Castle stands, and at its Entrance is large and capacious, though the further you go in, the more narrow it is, and contracted: Within the Mouth of it are several small Cottagers, who dwell in little clay Tenements erected therein; the top whereof is of a very great height, and appears to the Eye, as if it was Arched above, and Che∣quer'd with diversity of coloured Stones: At our Entrance, the poor People were ready to attend us with Candles and Lanthorns, and by their Con∣duct we ventured in, though it belonged to <HI>Satan</HI>'s Territories. After we were got a little way with∣in it, we found it very dark and slippery, by rea∣son of a great Current of Water, which runs a∣long the Cave, and were often forced to stoop, be∣cause
<PB N="91" REF="52"/>
the further we proceeded, the Rock hung down more low and sloping; We passed still on, till at length we were stop'd by the Water, which at that time being deeper than ordinary, and bub∣ling up apace in the Cave, cry'd, a <HI>Ne Ʋltra</HI> to us, though, as they say, 'tis usual, not only to wade over this with great facility, but another Current likewise, which runs along the Cave some ten or twelve yards distant from this to a third, which is impassible. The Story of the Shepherd, which pass'd over all, and at last came out into a fair delightful Field, savours too much of a Ro∣mance, to be credited; however, 'tis supposed, could all these Waters be once pass'd over, there might be made some new Discoveries, though I confess I should be extream loath, were it to pur∣chase the Fame of a <HI>Drake,</HI> or a <HI>Frobisher,</HI> to seek out a New found Land in so dismal a place, which both by its Name and Nature, hath so near a Relation to the Diabolical Regions.</P>
<P>Having made our Retreat from this <HI>Stygian</HI> Lake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mam-Tor.</NOTE> and being safely return'd through the De∣vils Posteriors, our <HI>Exit</HI> was as welcome as our Visit irksome, and we proceeded to take a view of the second thing, which deservedly merits the Name of Wonderful. 'Tis a high and steep Cliff, call'd <HI>Mam-Tor,</HI> from the top whereof, the Sand, though the Air be never so calm and serene, doth continually tricle down Night and Day: The Sight of which put us in mind of that Hill, where poor <HI>Sisyphus</HI> was allotted to Punishment, of row∣ling up a Stone which immediately tumbled down again, and so wearied the Wretch out in an endless Labour; and this bearing some little re∣semblance to that, by the frequent rumbling down of the Stones from above, which falling down from the Precipice with a very great Noise, do of∣ten astonish and afright the poor Neighbouring In∣habitants, made us a little stand off at a distance, believing our Curiosity would not countervail
<PB N="92" REF="53"/>
the Hazards we might run, or the Damage we might receive by our too near Approaches: On the Top hereof ariseth a Spring, which in some places streams along the Cliff, but affords nothing of Variety, save that it hath its source about that high Mountain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spring that Ebbs and Flows. The Mar∣ble Stones.</NOTE>The third Wonder we found as strange, which was the Spring that Ebbs and Flows like the Sea; and the fourth, which is called the Marble Stones, by their orderly disposition into several Rows, seem rather to have been the contrivance of Art, than of Nature, but that we ought not to derogate in any wise from that unimitable Parent, whose Productions are for the most part so rare and un∣accountable.</P>
<P>Not far distant from these, the fifth Wonder presented it self to us, known by the Name of <HI>Elden-Hole,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elden-Hole.</NOTE> 'tis reputed a bottomless Abyss, and could never yet be fathomed by any Art of Man; the Mouth of it is very wide and craggy, but the inward Recesses contracted and intricate. The Story of the Rustick that was let down with Ropes and Candles, to give an account of this Avernal Pit, and by his diving too far into the Bowels of the Earth, was drawn up Senseless, did too truly verifie that Poetick Aphorism, <HI>Coelum &amp; Tartarum ipsum petimus stultitiâ,</HI> and paid dear, by the loss of his Life, for his boldness and presumption, and we are as much in the Dark, concerning its Nature, as we were before: But though we can∣not give a positive Account of its immense Pro∣fundity, yet we may negatively conclude too, that it is not that which some represent it to be, a place where the blustering Winds Rendezvouze and Muster, for the Experiment will not hold good, That if a Cloth be trown in, it will be ross'd up again by the inpetuous Blasts from with∣in; neither did we perceive, but all was very whist and still during the time we staid by it, only, if we threw into it a Stone of any bigness, when we
<PB N="93" REF="53"/>
laid our Ears down close to the side of the Pit, the Ratling which it made by its fall, would be very distinct and audible for a long time toge∣ther, until it was got beyond our sphear of hear∣ing.</P>
<P>Passing from this, we rode on two or three Miles further, to <HI>Buxton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Buxton-<HI>Well.</HI></NOTE> a Village very Emi∣nent, in the <HI>Peak,</HI> for the sixth Wonder it glories in, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Hot Well.</HI> 'Tis inclosed in a fair Stone-Building, erected by the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and the Water, by its Operation, being of a near Affinity with that in the Cross-Bath, draws hither in the Summer, a great Concourse of People, of all Ages and Degrees, here being Lodgings pre∣pared on purpose, proportionable to their Quali∣ty, or Condition. The Fountain daily purging it self, runs away in a continued Current into the adjacent Meadows, and adds a reeking colour to the other Waters with which it unites its Tepid Streams. Not far distant from this, was formerly two Springs of a contrary Nature, the one hot, and the other cold, but the Partition betwixt them being small, and no care taken to preserve them, when we were at the place, the hot one seem'd then to be most predominant.</P>
<P>Here is often very good Company, amongst whom we gathered up a brief account of some o∣ther remarkable Places, which at that time we had not an opportunity to view. They assured us, That <HI>Darby,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Darby, Quarn∣don, Ked∣laston, Stanley, <HI>&amp;</HI> Wirks∣worth <HI>Springs.</HI></NOTE> the chief Town of the County was large, and fair, populous, and rich, consisting of five Parishes, and driving a very considerable Trade; that <HI>Quarndon</HI> Springs near that Town, are much of the Nature of <HI>Tunbridge-Wells,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and the <HI>Spaws</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> as strong of the Mineral, and as effectual in Operation; that <HI>Kedlaston</HI> Well is said to be singular in curing old Ulcers, and even Leprosie it self; that <HI>Stanley</HI> Springs are much like <HI>Quarndon,</HI> but not altoge∣ther so strong of the Mineral; and that near

<HI>Wirksworth,</HI> another Market Town in this Coun∣ty, are two Springs, the one warm and the o∣ther cold, and so near each other, that one may put one hand in the cold, and the other in the warm.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pool's-Hole.</NOTE>Not far from <HI>Buxton</HI> is the 7th and last Wonder, which is called <HI>Pool's-Hole,</HI> 'tis a hollow Cave un∣der a high Rock, bearing some kind of resem∣blance to <HI>Ochy-Hole,</HI> which I have before described, but no way so remarkable for so many amazing Varieties: Who that <HI>Pool</HI> was from whom it re∣ceived its denomination, whether some Hermite, that in this close Cell resolved to live an Ancho∣rite's Life, which by his Bed-Chamber here may not seem improbable, or what Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> that was, which they tell you betook her self private∣ly to this Grotto, as a safe <HI>Asylum</HI> or Sanctuary, I shall by no means undertake to determine; but sure I am, that the nature of this Cave is not much different from that I now mentioned, for there are some Shapes and Figures of Animals here, as of a Lion and a Dog, and there are some colours of the Stones within not much unlike to those in the other; besides the Water which runs along it in a small current doth petrefie, and the modes ob∣served both at our entrance and return are the same; for you go in with Guides and Lights, and when we came out we were met by some poor Woman, who live near to it, with Water and Herbs to purifie and cleanse our selves from any filth or dirt we might have contracted by creeping along that darksom Cavern.</P>
<P>But he that desires any further Satisfaction a∣bout these Seven Wonders let him have recourse to an ingenious Poem called <HI>Mirabilia Pecci,</HI> which was wrote some Years ago by the famous Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI> who had the honour to live sometimes in the Noble Family of the then Earl, now Duke of <HI>Devonshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chattes∣worth.</NOTE> who has now such a glorious Seat in the <HI>Peak,</HI> called <HI>Chattesworth,</HI> that it may be justly reputed the Eighth Wonder.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="54"/>When we had sufficiently-feasted our Eyes with these most admirable Rarities, and refreshed our selves a while after some few troublesom Fatigues, we mounted again, and made the best of our way thro' <HI>Ashbourn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ashbourn</NOTE> another Market-Town of a conside∣rable Trade to <HI>Ʋtcester,</HI> or <HI>Ʋtoxeter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Utcester.</NOTE> which being within the Limits of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> is situated upon the River <HI>Dove</HI> amongst verdant Meadows, and consequently rich in Pasture and Castle. Histo∣rians tell us, that <HI>Ʋlferus</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> residing at his Castle of <HI>Ʋlfercester,</HI> contractly <HI>Ʋlcester,</HI> and understanding that his Son <HI>Ʋlfade</HI> had carried his Brother <HI>Ruffus,</HI> under a pretended colour of Hunt∣ing, to St. <HI>Chad,</HI> a famous Father of the Church in those days, and that they were both instructed and baptized into the Christian Faith by the per∣suasion of <HI>Werebode</HI> a great Favourite of his, goes immediately to the Oratory of this Holy Man, where finding both his Sons in a devout Contem∣plation, he kills them immediately with his own Hand, whereupon <HI>Ermenhelde</HI> his Queen, and their Mother, entombed them in a Sepulchre of Stone, and in process of time caused a Church of Stone to be erected over them, which place was afterward called <HI>Stones,</HI> by reason of the many Stones that were brought hither by devout People in order for this sacred Structure. After this <HI>Ʋlfer,</HI> being extreamly dissatisfied with this inhumane Action, and repenting heartily for his barbarous Butchery, did himself turn Christian, and to shew his Zeal for the Christian Cause destroyed the Pagan Temples, burnt their Idols, and erected divers Churches and Religious Houses in their stead.</P>
<P>As we travelled along we found this County of a healthy Air and pleasant Soil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stafford∣shire.</NOTE> though North∣ward it appears more hilly and barren; in some parts it is full of Woods, in others it abounds with Coal and Iron, and so great was formerly the number of Parks and Warrens here, that most

Gentlemens Seats were accommodated with both. Its principal Rivers are the <HI>Dove,</HI> which so en∣richeth the Ground, that the adjacent Meadows are noted for yielding, as some will have it, the sweetest Mutton in <HI>England</HI>; and the famous <HI>Trent,</HI> which runs along thro' the middle of the County, being commonly reputed the third River in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> receives its Denomination, either say some, because there are Thirty Rivolets which run into it, or Thirty sorts of Fish that swim within its Streams; nay others go so far as positively to as∣sert what the <HI>Hungarians</HI> do of their River <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> that two Parts are Water, and the third Fish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stafford.</NOTE><HI>Stafford</HI> is about ten Miles from <HI>Ʋtcester,</HI> of great Antiquity, and hath gone under divers Names; it was at first built by <HI>Edward</HI> the Senior, under the name of <HI>Betheny,</HI> where one <HI>Berteline,</HI> that was afterward Canoniz'd for a Saint for his great Piety, led an Hermites Life; afterward <HI>Statford,</HI> and now <HI>Stafford.</HI> The noble Lady <HI>Elfleda,</HI> Wife to <HI>Ethelred</HI> Duke of <HI>Mercia,</HI> was very liberal in her Contributions in order to its Repairs, as she was likewise to divers other eminent Cities, who had suffered by the <HI>Danes</HI>: 'Tis situated in a fair Soil and a sweet Air, on the Banks of the River <HI>Sowe,</HI> with a Bridge over it; 'tis adorn'd with two Churches, one whereof is very large and spacious, and a Free-School, beautified with a large and uniform Market-Place, in which is a House where the Assizes are held for the County; the Streets are clean and well paved, the Buildings of Stone and Slate, and some of the Structures are very modish and beautiful. King <HI>John</HI> made it a Cor∣poration, and <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth confirmed and en∣larged the Charter. Here was a Priory of <HI>Black Canons</HI> built by <HI>Rich. Peche,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Litchfield, A.

<PB N="97" REF="55"/>
belonging heretofore to the Barons of <HI>Stafford,</HI> but in our late unhappy Broils it underwent the same Fate which divers other Castles did then undergo.</P>
<P>Whilst we were resident in this place, we had some notice that the great <HI>Asylum,</HI> which preser∣ved his Sacred Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> Second, was not far from this place; whereupon being then a little impatient to behold that unparallell'd San∣ctuary, we went from hence to <HI>Long Birch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Long-Birch.</NOTE> a pleasant Seat situate about eight or nine Miles from <HI>Stafford,</HI> and as then finding no convenient Opportunity to finish some particular Business which we had there to dispatch, we rode on till we came at last to that noted Wood, where that famous Oak stood in which his Majesty was preserved;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Royal Oak.</NOTE> we found it paled in with high Pales, which were beset with Spikes of Iron to keep off all Sons of Violence from offering it any harm. 'Tis true, a little before his Majesty's Restauration the whole Wood being felled, the top of this with the up∣per Branches were all then lopt off, but the Body of it did then remain very firm and entire, and was ordered to be preserved to future Genera∣tions.</P>
<P>Not far from that Wood stands a House called the <HI>White Lady</HI>'s,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> White Lady<HI>'s</HI></NOTE> belonging to the <HI>Penderels,</HI> who though but at first of a mean Extraction and For∣tune, yet could never be bribed to betray their Sovereign, who for some time lay thereabouts concealed amongst them: And indeed all things did so strangely concur to his Majesty's Protecti∣on, that Providence seem'd to have laid a golden Link of Causes on purpose to be instrumental to his glorious Preservation; thus tho the Oak stood by the common High-way which led through the Wood, and the bloody Sons of <HI>Mars</HI> rode under the very Boughs of it, whilst the King was there present, though the Persons, who at first had pro∣vided him that Sanctuary, being poor and indi∣gent,
<PB N="98" REF="56"/>
might have been wrought upon to betray their Trust, and rather balanced that way by the great Rewards that were then promised, and Ma∣jesty being then at a very low Ebb, a Royal As∣surance of some future remembrance might have then passed for a very unsuitable and insignificant Obligation to Fidelity, and though those grand Secrets being committed to some of the other Sex might have been in danger to have slipped thro' such chinky crannies, yet all went well, not the least discovery was made of any thing, and im∣partial Justice and Loyal Piety did never more visibly appear in the Cottages of the Country, than when Rural Swains became Protectors of their injured Sovereign, and Majesty was shrouded safely under a Peasant's Weeds.</P>
<P>We retired from hence to a Village called <HI>Tonge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tonge.</NOTE> about 3 Miles farther within the Limits of <HI>Shrop∣shire,</HI> which receives its Name from an old ruinated Castle belonging to the Family of the <HI>Pierpoints</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isabel</HI> the Wife of <HI>Fulk Pen∣bridge,</HI> Kt.

and the Men which are at work seem to be in no happier a Condition than they who dig at the Mines, or tug at the Galleys; for they work Night and Day after so indefatigable a manner, that the very Heat preys upon their Bodies, and shortens their Days; the place was soon too hot for us, and the noise too troublesom, and there∣fore we journeyed on to visit more of the Coun∣ty.</P>
<P>The Country appear'd to us no less pleasant than its Neighbours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shrop∣shire.</NOTE> and is of a wholesom and temperate Air, affording Health to the Inhabi∣tants at all Seasons of the Year, this was sufficient∣ly verified in old <HI>Thomas Parr</HI> of <HI>Alderbury,</HI> who lived 152 Years, and saw no less than ten Reigns; he was born here in 1483, in the Reign of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the Fourth, and died in 1635, and lies bu∣ried at <HI>Westminster:</HI> The Soil is generally fer∣tile, standing most upon a reddish Clay, and yields plenty of Pit-Coals and Iron, and has ever been in great repute for its populous Towns and Castles; for bordering upon <HI>Wales</HI> the Noblemen here and Persons of Quality were very sollicitous to preserve themselves secure against any Incur∣sions of the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and hereupon they fortified their Houses to prevent all Dangers; and this dividing <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Wales</HI> was call'd the <HI>Marches,</HI> for the defence of which the Lords here and Gen∣tlemen have enjoy'd formerly very great Privileges and Immunities, but since the Union of these two Kingdoms, as all Hostilities have ceased, so their ancient Rights and Privileges are not now so much insisted on.</P>
<P>Here are found in divers parts of this County several large Elms and other Trees under Ground, which have been supposed to lie there ever since the General Deluge; they are so dry, that being slit into small shivers they burn like Candles, and are made use of sometimes by the poorer sort instead of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="57"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shrews∣bury.</NOTE>In the midst of the County upon the Banks of the <HI>Severne,</HI> is seated upon a Hill the famous City of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> by the <HI>Britains</HI> named <HI>Caerpengren,</HI> by the <HI>Saxons</HI> called <HI>Scrobbesbirig,</HI> and by the <HI>Nor∣mans Sloppesbury</HI> and <HI>Salop</HI>; 'tis almost surrounded with the River, and strengthened with a large and broad Wall, where in some places two or three may walk abreast; and upon that part of it which looks towards <HI>Wales,</HI> stands the Water-House, in which is a Well many fathoms deep, from which the Water, drawn up there by Horses in great Buckets, is conveyed by Pipes into all parts of the City, there being convenient steps contrived from the bottom of the Ground to the top of the Well, for the Beasts to go forward and backward from their accustom'd Labours. <HI>Roger Montgomery</HI> in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, built on the North-side of it a strong Castle, and founded here <HI>A.

As to the neatness of its Streets and Buildings it yields to few other Cities in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>; and for publick Devotion it has five Parish Churches, two of which are beautified with lofty Spires; the City is governed by a Mayor, Re∣corder and two Sheriffs, who live generally in great Repute and Grandeur; and the three Mar∣ket-Days, which are here every Week, cause a very great Concourse both of the <HI>Welsh</HI> and other Persons, and occasions a considerable Trade in this place. Near to which a sharp Battel was fought <HI>A.

<P><PB N="101" REF="57"/>But I must not omit to speak of one thing more, that in the Year 1551, the Sweating-Sickness, which destroyed so many, breaking forth first here dispersed it self at length over the whole Nation.</P>
<P>Passing from hence we rode through <HI>Stretton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stretton.</NOTE> ten Miles distant from this City, and there being three of them which join close to one another, <HI>Little-Stretton, Church-Stretton,</HI> and <HI>All-Stretton,</HI> the middlemost being a Market Town is of great∣est Note.</P>
<P>But finding here nothing to detain us, we made no stop till we arrived at <HI>Ludlow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ludlow.</NOTE> the chief Town in this County; 'tis of greater Antiquity than Beauty, situated by the River <HI>Corve,</HI> defended by a Wall and Castle, both built by <HI>Roger</HI> Earl of <HI>Montgomery.</HI> When <HI>Robert de Belasme,</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and Son to <HI>Montgomery,</HI> was taken Pri∣soner in his Rebellion against <HI>Henry</HI> the First, the King then seised it; after this it was given away from the Crown by <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, and came into the Possession of the <HI>Lacys,</HI> from thence to the <HI>Mortimers,</HI> and at last it became the Inheritance of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> and by this means be∣ginning to come into great Repute, the Inhabi∣tants erected here a very stately Church, so that in a little time it excelled all its Neighbourhood; Kenry <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth instituting here the Coun∣cil of the <HI>Marches.</HI> Here was Young <HI>Edward</HI> the Fifth at the Death of his Father, and here died Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> eldest Son of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, both being sent hither by their Fathers for the same end, <HI>viz.</HI> by their Presence to satisfie and keep in order the unruly <HI>Welsh.</HI></P>
<P>But before I leave this County, I must not for∣get <HI>Pitchford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pitch∣ford.</NOTE> a Village very eminent for its Well of Pitch, which though it be scumm'd off returns again, and swims aloft upon the Surface of the Water. <HI>Cambden</HI> is of Opinion, that it is rather a Bituminous kind of Matter, such as is in the Lake <HI>Asphaltites</HI> in <HI>Palestine,</HI> or in a Fountain by

the Hill <HI>Agragas</HI> in <HI>Sicily</HI>; however the Inhabi∣tants are said to make the same use of it, which they do of Pitch, but whether like that in <HI>Jewry</HI> it hath the same Balsamick Virtues of drawing out Corruption, or healing Wounds or is of any efficacy against the Falling-Sickness, I have yet met with none who have made any Experi∣ment.</P>
<P>Coming again within the Confines of <HI>Hereford∣shire,</HI> near to <HI>Richard's-Castle,</HI> Nature, which is never more curious than in her Water-Works, presented us with an exceeding great Rarity, 'tis a Well called <HI>Bone-Well,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bone-Well.</NOTE> upon the Surface of which are still bubbling up several little Bones of <HI>Fishes,</HI> and when those which appear above are taken away, others do immediately succeed in their room.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lempster.</NOTE>We passed from hence to <HI>Lempster,</HI> a Town of great Antiquity; for here, saith the <HI>Notitia Mo∣nastica, Merwald</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians</HI> first built a Nunnery about <HI>A. D.</HI> 800. which was destroyed in the <HI>Danish</HI> Wars; after that here was a College of Prebendaries, until King <HI>Henry</HI> the first annex∣ed their Lands to the Abby of <HI>Reading,</HI> and so it became a Cell of <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monks to that Abby, being dedicated to St. <HI>James</HI>; some are of Opi∣nion that it received its name from <HI>Linum,</HI> Flax or Hemp, which were wont to grow here in great abundance; others from <HI>Lana,</HI> Wooll, because it is supposed to have the best Wooll, known by the name of <HI>Lempster</HI> Ore, which as it makes the finest Cloth in <HI>England,</HI> so doth its Wheat the purest Bread; hence it is grown Proverbial among the Inhabitants, <HI>For</HI> Lempster <HI>Bread and</HI> Weobley <HI>Beer, none can come near.</HI> The Town is situated in a pleasant Valley, and is governed by a Bayliff and Aldermen, and adorned with a handsom Hall for the dispatching of all publick Affairs.</P>
<P>Our next remove was again to <HI>Hereford,</HI> where amongst other Varieties we were entertained withal in the City, there are near to it some Re∣mains

of Antiquity, which then we had an op∣portunity more particularly to view, namely <HI>Sutton</HI> Walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sutton</HI> Walls.</NOTE> near to the Village of <HI>Marden,</HI> which are the Ruins of some ancient great Building, in all probability supposed to be the Mansion-House of <HI>Offa,</HI> when <HI>Kenchester</HI> flourished, or at least when <HI>Hereford</HI> was but in its Infancy: This <HI>Offa</HI> being King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and having in∣veigled <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of the <HI>East-Angles</HI> into his Palace, under colour and pretence of bestow∣ing his Daughter upon him in Marriage, by the advice of his ambitious Wife, in hopes to suc∣ceed him in his Kingdom, basely and treacherous∣ly caused his Head to be striken off by one <HI>Grim∣bert</HI> his Servant, and his Body being Buried upon the Banks of the River <HI>Lugg</HI> was afterward re∣moved to <HI>Hereford,</HI> and over it was Built the present stately Cathedral.</P>
<P>Hard by <HI>Lidbury,</HI> another Market Town of this County, near to the place where the Rivers <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Lugg</HI> unite, is a Hill called <HI>Marckley-Hill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marckley <HI>Hill near</HI> Lidbury.</NOTE> ce∣lebrated by our Historians for its wonderful Tra∣vel <HI>Feb.</HI> 7. 1571. for about six a Clock in the Evening on a sudden as it were rouzed out of a dull Lethargy, it moved with a roaring noise from the place where it stood, and by seven the next Morning had gone about 200 Foot, and so conti∣nued its Travels for 3 days together, to the great Horror and Astonishment of all the Neighbouring Inhabitants; whereupon <HI>Kynaston</HI> Chapel, Trees, Hedges and Sheep Folds fell down, and, which adds much to the Wonder, two High-Ways were turned about 300 Foot from their former Paths, the East parts to the West, and the West to the East, Pasturage being left in the place of Tillage, and this in the place of Pasturage.</P>

<P>From hence, Travelling again through <HI>Glocester,</HI> we arrived at <HI>Fairford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairford.</NOTE> a Market Town, formerly of good account for its curious Church Windows, in which was pourtrayed the History of the Bible in painted Glass; until they were defaced by the malicious Hands of those, who, being all Defor∣mity themselves, could not endure to see God wor∣shipped in the Beauty of Holiness.</P>
<P>After we were gone from this place, we were quickly got within the Precincts of <HI>Berkshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Berkshire.</NOTE> a County pleasant and fertile, watered with the River <HI>Isis,</HI> adorned with woody Hills, and thick Groves, and fruitful Valleys, whereof that which is called the <HI>Vale of White Horse</HI> is extreamly de∣lightful, and Nature compensates the Barrenness of the Soil in one place by her manifold Gifts she bestows upon it in another.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Faring∣don.</NOTE><HI>Farringdon</HI> was the first Town of Note we ar∣rived at, called in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle <HI>Fearndune,</HI> where about the Year 925 King <HI>Edward</HI> the Se∣nior died; which tho' situated upon a stony Soil, yet is now as famous for its great Market, as it was formerly for its impregnable Fortress, erected here by <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> against King <HI>Ste∣phen,</HI> which the King, though with the loss of a great number of his Soldiers, at last by his con∣tinued Assaults and Batteries took and utterly de∣molished.

And turned the High-way hither to make a shorter Passage, it began to be populous, and much frequented, and hath ever since been re∣puted the principal Town in the County: The Inhabitants are generally Maltsters (Barley be∣ing here a valuable Commodity) and great Cock-Masters too, for which little fierce Crea∣tures they make frequent Matches: The Magi∣strates by their Vigilancy and Care do keep up the Corporation in great Honour and Request, and the Mayor and Aldermen are diligent and circum∣spect in the discharge of their Offices, and for the more great and weighty Matters, which are above their Sphere, the Judges when they come

their Circuit, and keep the Assizes here for the County, do ease them of that trouble, by giving a final Determination of all.</P>
<P>When we had rode about five Miles further, we came within the limits of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> to a Town called <HI>Dorchester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dorche∣ster.</NOTE> built at first by <HI>Birinus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Caer-Dor,</HI> which <HI>Bede</HI> calls <HI>Dorcinia,</HI> and <HI>Leland Hydropolis,</HI> taking its name of the Waters it stands upon, sometimes Walled about and Castled, but all now ruined and gone, a round Hill there still ap∣pearing. Here, as we are told in the History of <HI>Allchester,</HI> the Superstitious ensuing Ages built <HI>Birinus</HI> a Shrine, teaching them that had any Cattel amiss to creep to that Shrine for help, such Blindness possessed them then, that they laid the Commandments of God aside to follow their own Traditions, and yet so blind are their Posterity, that they praise their Doings. That this was a Colony of the <HI>Romans</HI> is very evident from their various Coins and Medals bearing their Stamp, which have been found hereabouts, and it is as certain that formerly it was a Bishop's See, which <HI>Birinus</HI> the Grand Apostle of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> pla∣ced here; for in the Year 635, by the Preaching of this Holy Man, King <HI>Kinegilsus</HI> and all his Peo∣ple received the Christian Faith, to whom <HI>Os∣wald</HI> King of the <HI>Northumbers</HI> was God Father at the Font, whereupon a Bishop's See was here fixed. But besides <HI>Kinegilsus</HI> he Baptized after that <HI>Guicheline</HI> his Son too, and after him <HI>Cuthred</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> about the Year 639. He is said to have instituted Secular Canons in his Cathedral Church, who continued till in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen, Alexander</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> converted them to Canons Regular. Upon the Death of <HI>Ed∣ward, Aethelstan</HI> his eldest Son succeeded, and du∣ring his whole Reign guarded these Parts from all disturbance of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who in <HI>January</HI> 938 held here a Council, as the Learned Mr. <HI>Kennet</HI> informs us, <HI>In Civitate celeberrima quae Dornacestre

<P>The next Town of Note, which was obvious in the Road, was <HI>Henley,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henley.</NOTE> to which the River <HI>Thames,</HI> after it hath fetch'd a great Compass, doth at last approach; 'tis taken for a most ancient <HI>British</HI> Town, from <HI>Hen</HI> old, and <HI>Lhey</HI> a place; and, as <HI>Cambden</HI> and Dr. <HI>Plot</HI> suppose, was the head Town of the People called <HI>Ancalites,</HI> who submitted to <HI>Caesar:</HI> The Inhabitants are generally Barge-Men, and by carrying away much Corn and good store of Wood, of which there is great plen∣ty in the adjacent Villages, in their Barges to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> do enrich the Neighbourhood, and pick out to themselves a very comfortable Subsistence.</P>
<P>After a little respite we proceeded on to <HI>Maiden-head,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Maiden-head.</NOTE> which, they say, was thus denominated from the superstitious Adoration given to a <HI>British</HI> Maid, being one of the Eleven Thousand, which by the Conduct of St. <HI>Ʋrsula</HI> returning home from <HI>Rome,</HI> were all Martyr'd at <HI>Cologne</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> by the Tyrant <HI>Attila,</HI> that most cruel Scourge to the Christians: 'Tis of no long Date or Standing, for within this Hundred Years the Passage over the River was at a place called <HI>Babham's-End,</HI> but after that a strong Bridge of Wood was once here erected, it began to draw Strangers to it apace, and to outshine and excel its Neighbour <HI>Bray,</HI> which being now ancient gives its Name to the whole Hundred, 'tis not unlikely that the <HI>Bibroci</HI>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Windsor.</NOTE>In this Hundred is <HI>Windsor,</HI> where we arrived towards the declining of the Day: This place was given away by <HI>Edward the Confessor</HI> from the Crown to the Church of <HI>Westminster,</HI> but <HI>William the Con∣queror</HI> taking a great Affection to it, by reason of its pleasant Situation, made an exchange with the Abbot of <HI>Westminster</HI> for some other Lands in the room of this, and so it returned to the Crown again; the Palace here, to which the King and Court do resort in Summer time, is inferiour to none for Sight and Pleasantness, for Beauty and Magnificence throughout his Majesty's Dominions, and perhaps for curious Painting exceeds at this time all other Palaces in the Kingdom, being the admi∣red Workmanship of Unimitable Seignior <HI>Verrio</HI>; in the Front lies a pleasant Vale, garnished with Corn-fields, flourishing with green Meadows, deck'd with melodious Woods, and water'd with the gentle Streams of the noble River <HI>Thames</HI>; be∣hind it is a pleasant Prospect of a delightful Fo∣rest, design'd on purpose by Nature for Sport and Recreation, while she so liberally stocks it with numerous Herds of Deer lurking amongst the sha∣dy Thickets. In fine, 'tis such an <HI>Elysium</HI> for Pleasure and Delight, that our Kings and Princes have always chose to retire hither for their Diver∣sion; and <HI>Charles</HI> the Second was so taken with it, that he yearly kept his Court here in the Sum∣mer time.

<PB N="109" REF="61"/>
Born in this Town, for <HI>Henry</HI> the First had before erected it, fortifying the same with strong Walls and Trenches; he founded also a Chantry for Eight Priests, neither endowed nor incorporate, but maintained by an Annual Pension out of the Exchequer; but <HI>Edward</HI> the Third founded this College for a <HI>Custos,</HI> Twelve Secular Canons, Thirteen Priests or Vicars, Four Clerks, Six Cho∣risters, Twenty-six Alms-Knights, besides other Officers to the Honour of St. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor and St. <HI>George.</HI> In the Chapel lie interr'd two of our Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth and <HI>Charles</HI> the First; and to this Castle was committed Prisoners, <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. This Castle stands upon a <HI>Hill,</HI> with a stately and spacious Terrace before it, and it hath a very magnificent Church dedicated by <HI>Edward</HI> the Third to St. <HI>George,</HI> but brought to that present Splendor and Beauty, with which it is now illustrated, by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, and Sir <HI>Reginald Bray.</HI> Who this St. <HI>George</HI> was we have now mentioned, Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> in his Travels gives us the best account, That he was a <HI>Cappado∣cian,</HI> advanced in the Wars to the Dignity of a Tribune, who afterward became a Soldier of Christ, and is said in <HI>Lydda</HI> to have suffered Mar∣tyrdom under <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> where stands a Temple built to his Honour, as they say, by a King of <HI>England,</HI> which Church the <HI>Greeks</HI> have the Cu∣stody of, and do shew a Skull therein, which they affirm to be St. <HI>George</HI>'s. On this St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, which is <HI>April</HI> 23. King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, that he might give to true Chivalry that Honour and ample Reward it deserves, constituted first the most noble Order of the Garter, appointing a select number of Twenty-six Persons of Honour to wear a blue Garter on their left Leg, with this Motto in <HI>French,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Evil be to him that evil thinks.</NOTE> <HI>Hony soit qui maly pense,</HI> and these he call'd Knights of the Garter: Of this Order are and have been the most Puissant and Renown'd Princes

<P>On one side of the Church stand the Houses of the Dean and Prebendaries, who are Twelve in number; and on the other side, an House not un∣like the <HI>Graecian Prytaneum,</HI> for the comfortable Maintenance of Twenty-six poor Knights, who being all clad in long purple Gowns, bearing the Badge of the Cross upon them, are daily to be present, Morning and Night, at Divine Ser∣vice.</P>
<P>Betwixt the two Courts ariseth up a high Mount, on which is set a round Tower, and hard by it riseth another lofty Pinnacle, called <HI>Win∣chester Tower,</HI> of <HI>William Wickam</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> whom King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third made Over∣seer of this Work, when he Built the Castle. There is a Rumour of a certain Inscription that was engraven by this <HI>Wickam</HI> upon the inner part of the Wall, after the finishing of the Tower, in these Words, <HI>This made Wickam</HI>; which bear∣ing a dubious meaning, some of the Courtiers, that were his Enemies, represented them in such a sense to the King, as if he had arrogated to him∣self all the Glory and Magnificence of the Stru∣cture, and so had eclipsed the King's Honour, at which the King being incensed, and rebuking him for the Fact, he replied, That he did not mean that he had made the Castle, but that the
<PB N="112" REF="63"/>
Castle had made him, having raised him from a mean and low Condition to the King's Favour, and thereby to great Wealth and Dignity.</P>
<P>But before I leave this Bishop, I cannot omit one very remarkable Story which I find Record∣ed of him by <HI>John de Pontoys,</HI> in his History of the Bishops of <HI>Winchester</HI>; how this Renowned Prelate discovered a notorious Cheat to <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, put upon him by his own Queen <HI>Phi∣lippa</HI>; for that <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> who then went for his Son, was never Born of that Queen, but was really Supposititious, which she still con∣cealed for fear of the King's Anger; but after∣ward, a little before her Death, she declared the whole Truth to this Bishop, and command∣ed him to tell the King the whole Matter, when he should find the most convenient Opportu∣nity. <HI>Mr.</HI> Wharton's <HI>Anglia Sacra, pars prima</HI> p. 318.</P>

<P>Having satisfied our Curiosities with these plea∣sant Prospects, we took our Farewell of the Mu∣ses <HI>Athenaeum,</HI> as well as <HI>Mars</HI> his Cittadel, and crossing again the River arrived at <HI>Colebrook,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cole∣brook.</NOTE> three or four Miles distant from this place, so called from the River <HI>Cole,</HI> which gently glides along through <HI>Bucks</HI> and <HI>Middlesex</HI>; 'tis parted into several Chan∣nels, over which stand as many Bridges, and by the several partitions of its Streams it encompasseth several little pretty Islands, into which the <HI>Danes</HI> fled about the Year 894. whither King <HI>Alfred</HI> pursued them, and endeavoured what he could to annoy them, till at last for want of Provision he was enforced to quit that most advantageous Post.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF Mr. <HI>BROME'S</HI> Three Years TRAVELS, OVER <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Narrative of his Third Journey.</HEAD>
<P>WE diverted our selves for some little time in the City, but the Pleasures therein growing nauseating and irk∣som, and the Rural Diversions more pleasing and delightful, we resolved to undertake once more a Pilgrimage of a greater extent, than any we had done before; and the Vernal Season, which then began to attire the Country in all its bravery, did as mightily conduce to quicken our Resolutions in steering our Course about the Maritime Coasts of our Native Soil, as in taking
<PB N="115" REF="64"/>
a view of that further part of the Continent, to which before we had made no access.</P>
<P>Hereupon equipping our selves, like provident Pilgrims, with all things requisite for so great a Journey, we set forward, and having some Friends which accompanied us in our way, our first Remove was into the County of <HI>Essex,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Essex.</NOTE> a Country of as great Variety as Delight, of a considerable compass and very fruitful; 'tis full of Woods and shady Groves, enriched with all kind of Grain, abounds with Saffron, and is stocked with great Herds of Kine and Hogs; hereupon the Rusticks have great plenty of Dairies, and make Cheeses massy and ponderous; the Gentry generally are courtly and affable, and the Commonalty for the most part pretty well refined; but for them who live in the Hundreds (as they call that part of the County which lying more low and flat, and near to the Sea, is full of Marshes and Bogs) they are Persons of so abject and sordid a Temper, that they seem almost to have undergone poor <HI>Nebu∣chadnezzar</HI>'s Fate, and by conversing continually with the Beasts to have learn'd their Manners.</P>
<P><HI>Rumford</HI> was our first Stage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rumford.</NOTE> about ten Miles from <HI>London,</HI> renowned for its great Market for all manner of Cattle, but more especially celebra∣ted for its Hogs and Calves. After a little stop in this place, we passed on through <HI>Burntwood</HI> and <HI>In∣gerstone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnt∣wood <HI>and</HI> Inger∣stone.</NOTE> Towns of no great Note, save one for its Free-School, and both for their Markets and Ho∣spitable Inns, to <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> a Town twenty-five Miles from the City, where we took up our Quarters for one Night.</P>
<P>This Town stands in the Heart of the County,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chelms∣ford.</NOTE> being formerly called <HI>Chelmerford</HI>; 'tis situate be∣twixt two Rivers which meet here, <HI>viz. Chelmer</HI> from the East, and another from the South, the name whereof, if it be <HI>Can,</HI> as some would have it, we have no reason to doubt it was <HI>Old Cano∣nium,</HI> which <HI>Cambden</HI> tells us stood anciently in
<PB N="116" REF="65"/>
this place; it was of old very famous for a small Religious House erected by <HI>Malcolme</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and for its Church-Windows (having the History of Christ and the Escutcheons of its noble Benefactors painted in them) which were batter'd down by the Instigated Rabble in the late Rebel∣lion; but that which now renders it most Re∣nowned, is not only the Assizes, which are held here twice a Year for the County, but likewise its great Market for Corn, which the <HI>Londoners</HI> co∣ming down every Week take away in great quantities; and the Vicinity of the Nobility and Gentry, which lying round about it, do very much enhance its Glory, as well as promote its Trade.</P>
<P>But the Allurements of this place were too weak to detain us any longer than the Morning; for no sooner did we discern the modest Blushes upon <HI>Aurora</HI>'s Cheeks, but we prepared our selves for the Farewel of our Friends, where mutually embracing each other, with some passionate Ex∣pressions of Kindness at our departure, we left them to return to the City, and they with a gale of good Wishes speeded us forward on our Journey.</P>
<P>No sooner were they departed from us, but a Cloud of Sorrow overspread our Countenance, and, as if we had suffered an Eclipse of Friend∣ship upon our Souls by their Separation from our Bodies, we began to think that of all Evils which are incident to Humanity, there is none that equals Privation, upon which account we became for a while a little discomposed in our Thoughts, till <HI>Witham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Witham.</NOTE> another Market Town about five Miles distant from <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> Built, as is suppo∣sed, by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Senior, presented us with some other Scenes of Pleasure and Diversion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colche∣ster.</NOTE>However our main drift being for <HI>Colchester,</HI> we hastned to that place, which was formerly called <HI>Kaer-Colden</HI> by the <HI>Britains</HI>; but whether it took its Name from <HI>Colonia,</HI> a Colony of the
<PB N="117" REF="65"/>
<HI>Romans</HI> being here planted, or from the River <HI>Colne,</HI> 'tis not much material to enquire; the se∣veral Coins, which have been digged up here, bearing all the <HI>Roman</HI> stamp, do evince its Anti∣quity; and whether <HI>Lucius, Helena,</HI> and <HI>Constan∣tine,</HI> the first Christian King, Empress, and Em∣peror in the World, were Born here or no, sure I am, that the Inhabitants speak great things of her Father King <HI>Coel,</HI> who built the Castle, (tho' others will have it Built by <HI>Edward,</HI> Son of King <HI>Alfred</HI>) and the Walls of the Town, having ere∣cted a Statue for him in the midst of it, which they preserve with great Reverence to perpetuate his Memory: And 'tis as certain, that in remem∣brance of the Cross which his Daughter found here, they give for their Arms a Cross engrailed betwixt two Crowns. It suffered much of old from the Fury of the <HI>East-Saxons</HI> about the Year 921, as the <HI>Saxon Chronicle</HI> informs us, who ha∣ving taken it by Storm put all to the Sword, ex∣cept a few, who by stealth crept away, and saved themselves by flight, and destroyed all its For∣tresses, and threw down its Walls; but King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the Confessor came and Fortified it again, and having repaired all its Breaches, and streng∣thened it with a Garison, it began by degrees to recover its Losses, and retrieve its ancient Splendor and Comeliness; for, being pleasantly seated upon the Brow of a Hill, which extends its self from East to West, it quickly drew to it numerous Shoals of Inhabitants, whereby its Buildings were en∣larged, and its Churches encreased to the number of 15 within the Walls, and 1 without, besides 2 Religious Houses, an Abby built here <HI>A. D.</HI> 1096. by <HI>Eudo,</HI> Steward to King <HI>Henry</HI> I. to the Honour of St. <HI>John</HI> Baptist, for the use of the <HI>Benedictine Monks,</HI> the first of that Order which was erected in <HI>England</HI>; and another Priory, saith the <HI>No∣titia Monastica,</HI> Founded <HI>A.

and dedicated to St. <HI>Botolph</HI> and St. <HI>Julian.</HI></P>
<P>In the late unhappy Civil Wars it had its share of Calamities, for being close Besieged by their Enemies, the Royalists within behaved themselves so bravely, that they could neither take it by Violence, nor enforce it to a surrender, till having block'd up all Avenues whereby the least Provision might be conveyed to them within, they were reduced to such Exigency and Want, Hunger exercising its Tyranny within the Walls, with no less rigour than the Enemy did without, that they were com∣pelled by one Enemy to Surrender to another, and to fall by the Sword, rather than die by Hunger: Nor were the Royalists more famous for their Va∣lour and Bravery, than the adverse Party was infa∣mous for their Baseness and Treachery; for ha∣ving got possession of the Town, they did not on∣ly exercise the utmost Rigour and Severity upon the weaker sort, who could make no Resistance, but even in cold Blood, did they barbarously Mur∣der Sir <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> and Sir <HI>George Lisle,</HI> Persons of great Integrity and undaunted Courage; who be∣came Victorious to their Malice, being cruelly shot to Death by the Sanguinary Hands of the Inso∣lent Soldiers in the Castle-yard; on which Spot of Ground, where they fell down dead, there hath never since, as is reported, sprouted up any Grass, as there was wont to do, the very Ground it self, it seems ever since being clad with mourning Weeds, and the Grass, as it were dreading such execrable Murders, retires and hides it self within the Bowels of the Earth: But tho' just <HI>Nemesis</HI> designs perhaps that plat, as a Monument of infamy to succeeding generations, yet doth a Vault prepared for the Fa∣mily of Sir <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> secure both his own and Fellow-sufferers Body from any farther Attempts of the Sons of Violence; and being wrapped in Lead they lie in that Church, which was next to his own House, and was formerly a fair and Sumptuous Structure, but was ruinated by his Ene∣mies,
<PB N="119" REF="66"/>
who hated the House for the Masters sake, and were so maliciously incensed against all that had relation to that Noble Family, that they sa∣crilegiously violated the Tombs of the Lady <HI>Lucas</HI> and <HI>Killigrew</HI> in the Church adjoyning, and inhu∣manely used their dead Bodies dismembring, and disjoynting their very Trunks, and wearing their Hair in their Hats by way of Triumph.</P>
<P>The Castle is now quite demolished, and gone to decay, and though they shew'd us a Brazen-Gate, which gives entrance, as they say, to a Vault fifteen Miles under-ground, yet the Stories they multiply concerning both, are so Roman∣tickly idle and extravagant, that there is little cre∣dit to be given to any Relations concerning them: As for the Town it is very Rich and Populous, and there are Merchants of considerable Estates, and great Traders who inhabit it; The chief Ma∣nufacture of the Place is Stuff and Bays, which are from thence transported into divers parts of the World, and there being a Colony of <HI>Dutchmen</HI> planted here, they are industrious in keeping up the Trade; nor is it less Famous for its Oysters, which by the general Vogue of most Persons are reputed the best in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We betook our selves from hence into its Neigh∣bouring County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> which is divided into too Parts called High and Low <HI>Suffolk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suffolk.</NOTE> the former of which is Miry and Dirty, the other more Plea∣sant and Delightful, but both are of a fat and fertile Soil, the Air is here Wholesome and counted proper for Consumptive people; the Country abounds in Rye, Pease, and Hemp, feeds abundance of Sheep, and produceth great Store of Butter and Cheese; 'tis every where adorned with stately Pa∣laces and Magnificent Edifices, to which the Parks, Replenished with Game adjoyning, are very conducive to their Profit and Delight.</P>
<P>The first place of note we arrived at here, was <HI>Ipswich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ipswich.</NOTE> called by the Saxons <HI>Gippeswick,</HI> situate on
<PB N="120" REF="67"/>
the North side of the <HI>Stour,</HI> at the foot of a steep Hill, commodious for its haven, enriched by For∣reign commerce, replenished with Inhabitants, a∣dorned with several Magnificent Churches, and be∣ing united into a Corporation is governed by two Bayliffs, who have all other Ministers befitting their Grandeur to attend them: It has been for∣merly fortified with Rampires and Trenches, but to little purpose, it being incapable of Defence by its Situation, because commanded by hills on all sides, but the South, and South-east: So that the <HI>Danes</HI> did easily master it 991. who nine Years after reduced it in a manner to a heap of Ruines; in the <HI>Norman</HI> times it began to recover it self, in∣somuch that it consists at this time of divers Pa∣rishes, graced with many fair Buildings. The <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> built a Castle, which held out Stoutly against King <HI>Stephen,</HI> but was forced at last to Surrender, and is supposed by <HI>Cambden</HI> to have been demolish∣ed by <HI>Henry</HI> the Second: Here Landed the 3000 <HI>Flemmings</HI> called in by the Nobility against the said King <HI>Henry,</HI> when his Sons rebell'd against him; and 'tis very observable, that in the Civil Wars under the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the First, this Town stood clear of most of those Calamities which overspread and involved the rest of the Nation: The Streets are kept clean and well Pav'd, and in the midst of the Market-place, which is surround∣ed with rich Shops, Stands a curious Cross with the Essigies of the great and Impartial Goddess <HI>Astraea,</HI> bearing a pair of Scales in the one Hand, and a Sword in the other, a fit emblem to re∣mind the Magistrates of the exact measures they must use in the distribution of Justice, and with what Severity they must proceed in discounte∣manding all the contrary acts of Violence and Oppression. The Store-houses, which are kept for the Kings Ships, do much promote the Trade of the Town; and there is no small Ad∣vantage rebounds to it by the continual supply of
<PB N="121" REF="67"/>

<P>Before the Subversion of <HI>Monasteries</HI> it had its share of some such Religious Houses, and of a Magnificent College begun by Cardinal <HI>Woolsey,</HI> who receiving here his first Breath, though of a mean Extraction, being only a Butchers Son, did at last attain to such Dignity and Renown, as to surmount most Prelatical Grandees, that have been in this Nation before him; but as he was mounted up with admiration to the Hill of Ho∣nour, he did at last as suddenly tumble down head∣long from that dangerous Precipice, and though it might have been as truly said of him in one, as it was of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great in another Sense, <HI>Aestuat infaelix angusto limite Mundi,</HI> that this mi∣crocosm of our <HI>English</HI> Soil was too little and nar∣row for his large and boundless Thoughts, and ambitious Desires; yet behold, <HI>Sarcophago contentus,</HI> a little Urn contains all his Pomp and Grandeur, which extended it self from our <HI>British Island</HI> to the <HI>Popish Conclave</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and his dust appears of no finer mold, than those poor Creatures from whom at first he lineally descended.</P>
<P>After some respite in this Place, we pass'd on through <HI>Needham, Stow</HI> and <HI>Wulpit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Needham, Stow <HI>and</HI> Wulpit.</NOTE> Towns of lit∣tle Fame or Repute, but what accrues to them by their Markets, or the River <HI>Orwell,</HI> which enrich∣eth the Soil, to St. <HI>Edmunds-Bury,</HI> the Eye, and in∣deed the pleasant <HI>Elysium</HI> of the whole County.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Ed∣munds-Bury.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Town is call'd St. <HI>Edmunds-Bury</HI> from <HI>Edmund</HI> the Martyr, King of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> who for refusing to renounce the Christian Faith, was shot to Death by Arrows at <HI>Hoxon</HI> by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and was buried in this Place: It is further styled by <HI>Antiquaries Villa Faustini,</HI> and though it be not the same with the Poet <HI>Martial</HI>'s, which he so elegantly describes, yet it no ways falls short in any thing, which may render it amiable or de∣lightful; for 'tis Situated in a Pleasant Air, in a
<PB N="122" REF="68"/>
wholesom Soil, not in any part annoyed with noisom Fogs, or offensive Vapours, but so libe∣rally enriched by Nature with a contribution of all Varieties, which may illustrate and beautifie it, that it draws hither great numbers of Persons of Quality; and there is hardly to be met withal in any Town Corporate of our <HI>British</HI> Island a more noble Colony, or glorious Asterism of the Gentry, than is visibly shining in this renowned Sphere.</P>
<P>The Town it self hath been very famous for a large and stately Monastery, Founded by <HI>Canutus</HI> in Honour of St. <HI>Edmund,</HI> whom his Father <HI>Suenus</HI> had caused to be put to Death, to expiate which Murther, being affrighted with a Vision of St. <HI>Ed∣mund</HI>; he erected a curious Structure, beautifying it with costly Ornaments, enriching it with great Revenues, and offering his own Crown at the Martyr's Tomb. As the Incomes which the Monks hereby enjoyed were very considerable, so were the Privileges granted to them unspeakable, be∣ing under the Government of a Seneschal or Stew∣ard, who did not only govern them, but preside over the whole Town besides; by whose strict Order and Discipline the Townsmen were so awed and kept under, that in King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third's Reign, they rose up in Arms against the Monks, took away all their Gold and costly Habiliments, their Books, Charters, with the Assay of their Coins, Stamp, and all other things appertaining to their Mint, for which they were afterwards sharply punished and fined by the King, and en∣forced to cry <HI>Peccavi,</HI> and make a full Restitution of what they had so unjustly defaulked from them. After this Broil was over, it encreased again in such Wealth and Honour, great Offerings being daily made at St. <HI>Edmund</HI>'s Shrine, that it appear∣ed rather like a City than a Monastery, so many Gates it had for entrance, and many of them Brass, so many Towers, and above all a most glo∣rious
<PB N="123" REF="68"/>
Church; and thus it continued till the final Dissolution of it by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, since which there remains nothing now, but the Car∣cass of that ancient Structure; and yet even still by its Ruins it is easie to conjecture what a maje∣stick Fabrick it once was.</P>
<P>To this adjoins two large Churches of curious Architecture, dedicated the one to St. <HI>James,</HI> and the other to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and in that spacious Church Yard, in which they both stand, being only part∣ed by a decorous shady Walk of Trees, as the Assizes for the County are held at the further end of it, in a Court-House erected for that purpose, so there are divers Monuments dispersed all over it with various ancient inscriptions; but three Epi∣taphs in a more especial manner we did more par∣ticularly take notice of.</P>
<P>The first is an Epitaph upon <HI>Charles Granger,</HI> a Shooemaker, who died when he was almost Four∣score.</P>
<Q><L>Brave Hero, whose attempts in Martial Camp</L>
<L>Such radiant Lustre on your name instamp,</L>
<L>That now 'tis dubious which displays more light</L>
<L>T' our spacious Hemisphere, the Sun or it.</L>
<L>You dead, your Trophies live, and live to be</L>
<L>Sacred Monuments to all Posterity.</L>
<L>But unkind Fate, that cut the Thread so soon</L>
<L>Of hastned Life, not to its period spun.</L>
<L>But sublime Soul, that could no longer stay</L>
<L>On Earth, this humile Prison, than to pay</L>

<L>To King, to Country, and Religion;</L>
<L>Which paid, you soon took flight, exchanged soon</L>
<L>This dungeon Earth for a Celestial Throne.</L></Q>
<P>The second is upon <HI>Christopher Barret</HI>'s Tomb∣stone, a Youth, whose Elogy is this:
<Q>Puer boni ingenii: <HI>Or,</HI> Puer bono ingenio.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="69"/>The third is upon one <HI>Joan Kitchin.</HI></P>

<P>On the Front of that noble and spacious Gate, which leads into the Abbey, is a place called the <HI>Angel-Hill,</HI> very signal for its row of curious Buildings, most of which belong to Persons of Quality; and a little further in the <HI>North-Gate-street,</HI> besides several Houses of great Note and Eminency, stands the Free-School, being a new Structure erected of Brick, by the liberal Contri∣bution of well-disposed Benefactors: The ancient Station for the School was formerly in the <HI>East-Gate-street,</HI> and was Built and Endowed by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth with a generous Minerval for a Master and Usher, and four Exhibitions for four Scholars at their Transplantation to the Univer∣sity of <HI>Cambridge</HI>; but that being very inconve∣nient by reason of a little Rivolet, which running along by it, by whose muddy streams it was fre∣quently overflowed, and the School it self much impair'd and gone to decay, through the care and prudence of its Governors, who are Twelve in
<PB N="125" REF="69"/>
number, and the assistance of some other worthy Gentlemen within the Neighbourhood thereof, it was translated at last into a better Soil, and fixed in a more pleasant and convenient place.</P>
<P>On the Front of it stands the Statue of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and at the upper end of the School were placed his Royal Arms with this In∣scription,
<Q><L>Edwardus Sextus posuit, Virtutis Alumnus,</L>
<L>Gratis disce puer, Regia namque Schola est.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Master and Usher, who here preside, are Persons of no less Note than Learning, and by the great Concourse of Scholars which flock hither, and have come to this place from the remotest Parts of the Nation, 'tis easie to guess at the strict∣ness of their Discipline, and their admirable way of instructing Youth, which seems here to be Hereditary, there having of late been successively three Masters of great Worth and Honour, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dickenson,</HI> Dr. <HI>Stephens,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Leeds,</HI> the present Master, who hath sufficiently signalized his Name to Posterity by several useful and learn∣ed Books, he hath published, under the last of which I had the Happiness to receive the first Ru∣diments of my Education; nor can I mention his Name without the most profound Respect, nor when I think of his manifold Favours conferred upon me, refrain from breaking forth into a Poe∣tical Rapture with the sincerest Gratitude ima∣ginable,
<Q><L>—Dii, siqua pios respectant Numina, siquid</L>
<L>Ʋsquam justitiae est, aut mens sibi conscia recti,</L>

<P>Out of this Street lies a way up into a fair Champaign Heath, where the Walks are so plea∣sant, and the Air so sweet, that every gentle gale
<PB N="126" REF="70"/>
doth fan and clear the Blood from all gross and feculent Humours, and infusing a more than or∣dinary Agility and Briskness into the Spirits, keeps the Body constantly in an even and healthy <HI>Crasis</HI>; And indeed every where about the Town there are dispersed such variety of Delights for Recrea∣tion, so much Wit and Facetiousness for Diver∣sion, so much gentile Complaisance for Imitation, that 'tis no wonder to behold it so Populous and so Rich, so Gay and so Glorious, and every day to receive still greater addittaments of Wealth and Honour.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the particular Govern∣ment of the Town, 'tis under the Charge of an Alderman with Twelve Brethren, who are his Assistants, out of which the Chief Magistrate is annually elected, who have all things necessary to support their Grandeur: And for its constant sup∣plies of Provision, there is weekly a great Market of Corn and all other Commodities, to be service∣able to the Inhabitants; and for the farther pro∣moting of our <HI>English</HI> Manufactures, there are two great Fairs kept here every Year, wherein they may furnish themselves with what their Mar∣kets are not able to supply them.</P>
<P>Not far from this Town was that great Battel fought against King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, in which he overthrew <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> with his Rabble of <HI>Flemmings,</HI> the Earl himself and his Wife being taken Prisoners. And here was Born <HI>Richardus de Bury,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> the Governor of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the Third when young, and famous espe∣cially for a Work which he entituled <HI>Philobiblos,</HI> in the Preface of which he confesseth, <HI>Ecstatico quodam librorum amore potenter se abreptum</HI>; he was well acquainted with <HI>Petrarch</HI> the <HI>Italian,</HI> and other Learned Men of that Age: <HI>Bradwardin,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Richard Fitz-Ralph Armachanus, Walter Burleigh, Robert Halcot,</HI> and other famous Men of that Age, were his Chap∣lains.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="70"/>We diverted our selves a while with our Friends, whose Civility and Kindness was as generous as their Entertainments free and cordial, but though the Charms of this place were very strong and in∣viting, yet at last we were enforced unwillingly to break through these alluring Enchantments; and resolving again to seek out new Adventures, we passed from hence through <HI>Buddesdale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Buddes∣dale.</NOTE> a Mar∣ket Town of good Note, to a little Village called <HI>Scole,</HI> very famous for an Inn and Sign-Post, built by a Gentleman of this Country at a considerable Charge.</P>
<P>The House is of Brick, neat and uniform,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scole-<HI>Inn.</HI></NOTE> and hath great variety of Objects for Diversion; in the Porch, at the four Corners, stand the Statues of two Men playing on Wind-Musick, a Tapster filling out Drink, and a Tumbler shewing of Tricks; on the two side Posts, <HI>Hercules</HI> with his Club, and <HI>Sampson</HI> with his Jaw-bone; on the Front is the Figure of the Whale vomiting up <HI>Jonah</HI> out of his Mouth; and on the East side of the House the Statue of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> with an Anchor and an Olive Branch: But that which is most admirable, is the contrivance of the Sign-Post, which seems to contain an Epitome of <HI>O∣vid</HI>'s <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> in Effigie; on the top of it is an Astronomer looking through a Quadrant, and riding upon an Anchor, with the four Cardinal Virtues on each side of him; <HI>Fortitude</HI> with her Pillars, <HI>Temperance</HI> with a Cup pouring out Wine, <HI>Prudence</HI> with a Snake in her Right-hand, and Horn of Plenty in her Left; and <HI>Justice</HI> with a pair of Scales and a Sword. All along the Sign-Post stand several Images curiously carved and painted; the first represents a Huntsman equipped and accoutred with his Horn and green Jacket, as if he was then very hot upon his Chase; and next to him <HI>Actaeon</HI> transformed into a Stag, under which is this Inscription, <HI>Actaeon ego sum, Domi∣num cognoscite vestrum</HI>: The next is <HI>Diana,</HI> with a
<PB N="128" REF="71"/>
Half-Moon upon her Head, the Planets under her Feet, her Quiver in her Hand, and her Horn by her side, and before her is a Grey hound in a close pursuit after a Hair: After which stands old <HI>Time</HI> with an Hour-Glass on his Head, a Syth in his Left-Hand, a Prodigal Youth in his Right, and Death under his Feet, with this Inscription, <HI>Tempus edax rerum.</HI> In the middle hangs the Sign of the White Hart, ingeniously contrived into an Oval Figure, with two Angels and two Lions at each corner, under one of which are placed four naked Boys pressing of Grapes, and under the other a Tumbler shewing feats of Activity. On both sides are Coats of Arms of some of the chief Fami∣lies both in <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> with <HI>Bacchus</HI> sitting astride upon a Barrel, and holding two Bunches of Grapes in one hand, and a Cup of Wine in the other; The Effigies of a Triton riding upon the back of a Dolphin; and also of a Shepherd playing merrily upon his Rural Pipe; And last of all, on each side of the Post, which supports the whole Fabrick, stands three-headed <HI>Cerberus,</HI> the great Janitor of the Infernal Court; and grisle∣bearded <HI>Charon,</HI> with his Boat and Oars wafting a Wench over the <HI>Stygian</HI> Ferry.</P>
<P>And because I find a great Master of Wit and Poetry, Mr. <HI>Alexander Brome,</HI> exercising his Fan∣cy ingeniously upon this Subject, I shall borrow from his Book that elegant Poem, which was Print∣ed some years ago.</P>

And yet, notwithstanding such his vaunting Ha∣rangues, he was afterward forced to submit both that and himself to the Mercy of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second; and could not without great Sums of Money, and sufficient Pledges for his future Loy∣alty, obtain the Favour from him, that this Castle might not be demolished, when divers others un∣derwent the same Calamities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hales∣worth.</NOTE>From hence passing away through <HI>Halesworth</HI> (formerly called <HI>Healsworda,</HI> which was made a Market Town by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, at the request of Sir <HI>Rich.

<PB N="133" REF="73"/>
pronounced <HI>Sowlds-Bay,</HI> is chiefly made by the shooting forth of the <HI>Easton Ness,</HI> which lies North-East from it, and covers it from Northerly Winds. The commodiousness of Anchorage makes many Vessels lie near; by reason of which the Mariners become good Benefactors to it, and contribute ex∣ceedingly to its Trade and Commerce: 'Tis very famous for the many Rendezvouz's of our Royal Fleets, near to which the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have so frequently disputed their Maritime Privileges with Powder and Bullet, where their resolute Cou∣rage hath been so Renown'd amongst the neigh∣bouring Nations, that they have even trembled at their furious Onsets, as if every Broad-side had been a Thunder-clap from Heaven, which pre∣sently threatned their immediate Destruction; that though they became Victims to each other's Fury, yet memorable Trophies of their invin∣cible Valour will still remain to succeeding Gene∣rations.</P>
<P><HI>Lestoff,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lestoff.</NOTE> a little narrow Town, which stands upon the Sea, being the last Market Town we visited in this County, made us quickly a Passage for its neighbouring County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> which are parted by the Rivers <HI>Ouse</HI> and <HI>Wavency.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a Region of a large extent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Norfolk.</NOTE> and near the Sea is Champaign, and yields plenty of Corn, in other parts Woody or full of Heaths, well cover∣ed with Sheep and Conies; 'tis adorn'd with di∣vers curious Seats of the Nobility and Gentry; and as the Villages stand thick, so the Market-Towns are numerous; but that which is too Re∣markable, though in some few places the Chur∣ches appear very decorous and splendid, yet the generality of them are poor and mean Fabricks, being for the most part thatch'd, or covered with Straw or Reeds, and endowed with very small and inconsiderable Revenues; a thing not much for the Honour of our <HI>English</HI> Reformation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yarmouth</NOTE><HI>Yarmouth</HI> was the first Town of any Note which
<PB N="134" REF="74"/>
entertained us with a pleasant and divertive Pro∣spect; the Haven is as commodious as the Town beautiful, being fortified both by Art and Nature: For although it be environed almost round with Water, on the West-side with the River <HI>Yare</HI> (from whence it receives its Name) which hath a draw Bridge over it, and from other Parts with the Ocean, unless it be Northward, where there is firm Land, yet it is likewise inclosed with a very strong Wall, upon which, besides Towers, is cast up a Mount towards the East, and are planted several Pieces of Ordnance to defend the Town and command the Sea. There is but one Church, but that fair and lofty, adorned with a high spire Steeple, built at first by <HI>Herbert</HI> Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI>; but there are divers clean and spaci∣ous Streets, on each side of which are several rows of very uniform Buildings, inhabited by wealthy and gentile Persons.</P>
<P>That this Town is of no great standing, but re∣ceived its beginning from the Ruines of old <HI>Gari∣annonum,</HI> is the general vogue of all Antiquaries: And 'tis certain that <HI>Cerdick,</HI> a valiant <HI>Saxon</HI> Cap∣tain coming here to the place, which is still called <HI>Cerdick-shore,</HI> about the Year 895, as the <HI>Saxon Chronicle</HI> informs us, together with his Son <HI>Cyn∣rick</HI> and five Ships; and finding it much decayed, by reason the River <HI>Yare</HI> had diverted its Current another way, planted a Colony of <HI>Saxons</HI> in a moist and watery Ground upon the West-side of the River, which place he called <HI>Yarmouth</HI>; but the Inhabitants finding both the Air and Soil very prejudicial to them, transplanted themselves to the other side of the River, called from the same <HI>Cerdick, Cerdick-Sand,</HI> and built this new Town, which in a short time grew so potent and popu∣lous, that they strengthened it with a Wall, and were able to make up so strong a Body of Sea∣men, as would frequently make Incursions upon the Neighbourhood of <HI>Lestoff,</HI> and the adjacent

Cinque-Ports, against whom they had a particu∣lar Antipathy, because they were excluded by them from many advantageous Privileges, which their Ancestors had enjoyed: But these private Feuds did at last end by an express Order from the King, and their Courage was quelled by a sud∣den and fearful Pestilence, which in the space of one Year brought above Seven thousand Men and Women to their Graves, all which was faithfully Recorded in an ancient Chronographical Table, which formerly used to hang up in their Church; since which time, as their Grudges have ceased, so their Wealth hath encreased, and 'tis now a place of great Merchandize and Traffick, but especially renown'd for its Fishery of Herrings, of which, at the season, there is usually such plenty, that they do not only supply our own, but Fo∣reign Nations too, after they have been by their great care and industry dried and salted in parti∣cular Houses set apart for that purpose.</P>
<P>The Haven it self is capacious enough for Ves∣sels of great Burdens, and standing well for <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> affords a ready passage to it, and is a fre∣quent Shelter for the <HI>Newcastle</HI> Coal Fleet, when distressed by Weather; but the North-East Wind being subject frequently to annoy this Coast, and drive in the Sand and Beach in great heaps, the Townsmen are forced to be at a great Expence, by removing all such Obstacles to clear their Haven.</P>
<P>From this place we hastned to <HI>Norwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Norwich.</NOTE> which is the Metropolis of the County, situate at the in∣flux of the <HI>Winsder</HI> into the <HI>Yare,</HI> and sprung up out of the Ruins of <HI>Venta Icenorum,</HI> now called <HI>Ca∣stor,</HI> about three Miles distance from it, in which not many years since was found a great number of <HI>Roman</HI> Urns: And from <HI>Wic,</HI> which in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Tongue signifies a Castle, the Learned Mr. <HI>Gibson</HI> in his Explication of Places not improbably gues∣seth, that it might receive its denomination.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="75"/>This is one of the most Renowned Cities in our <HI>British</HI> Island, for whether we consider the Wealth of the Citizens, the number of Inhabitants, the great confluence of Foreigners, the stately Stru∣ctures, and beautiful Churches, the obliging de∣portment of the Gentry, and the laudable Indu∣stry of the Commonalty, they do all concur to illustrate and dignifie it; 'tis situated on the brow of a Hill, and environed with a Wall, upon which were placed divers Turrets, and Twelve Gates to give entrance into the Town, unless it be on the East side, where the River (after it hath with many windings watered the North part of the City, having four Bridges over it) is a de∣fence by reason of its deep Channel and high Banks; 'tis reputed a Mile and half in length, and half as much in breadth, drawing in it self at the South side, till it almost appear in the form of a Cone.</P>
<P>The great Damages it sustained, and Misfor∣tunes it was exposed to, when <HI>Sucnus</HI> the <HI>Dane</HI> with his Bloody Crew took his range in these Parts; and after that <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror had settled the <HI>British</HI> Crown upon his Head, were too dole∣ful and tragical a Story to relate: Nor were the Calamities it underwent less deplorable, when <HI>Hugh Bigod,</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> sided with Young Prince <HI>Henry</HI> against his Father, and, as 'tis suppo∣sed, re-edified the Castle which stands upon a high Hill, and was once thought impregnable, till <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Monsieur, by the assistance of the Seditious Barons, won it at last by Siege. And as if the Plague and the Sword had made a Con∣spiracy together, utterly to subvert and destroy it, the Pestilence in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, consumed no less than 57374, be∣sides Ecclesiastick Mendicants, and Dominicans: But after this, in succeeding Ages, it began again to flourish, whilst to recruit their strength, which was much impair'd, King <HI>Henry</HI> the First per∣mitted

the Citizens to Wall the City, and King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second gave them a Grant for the Transportation of Worsted, and to advance their Trade, which was extreamly eclipsed; King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth renewed their Charter, and con∣ferred on them the Honour to chuse every Year a Mayor, whereas by a former Order from King <HI>Stephen,</HI> they were only govern'd by Coroners and Bayliffs: And as if the Fates with no less eager∣ness designed their Felicity, than before they con∣sulted their Misery, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who flock'd over hither during the Bloody Inquisition of Duke <HI>Alva,</HI> have made it very opulent by the great Trade of Says, Bays, and other curious Stuffs, which here occasion a considerable Merchandize.</P>
<P>Here is an Hospital, where above an Hundred Men and Women are maintained; and <HI>A.

was provided that all Episcopal Sees should be translated from smaller Villages to more eminent Cities: But his next Successor to him, save one, <HI>Herbert Losing,</HI> settled it at last in <HI>Norwich, A.

This Church is a very stately and magnificent Structure, and famous not only for its Cross and Cloyster, but for the Roof likewise, which runs aloft over the Body of it, on which is pourtrayed to the Life the History of the Bible in divers little Images, curiously carved and adorned, from the Creation of the World to the Ascension of our Blessed Saviour, and the Descent of the Holy Ghost, with the perfect Fi∣gures and Resemblances of our Lord's Crucifixi∣on and Resurrection, and divers other Circum∣stances that attended him, both at his Nativity and Passion. And for the Encouragement of Pie∣ty and Learning, every Sunday Morning through∣out the Year there is a Sermon preached by such Ministers as the Bishop shall appoint, to each of which is presented Twenty Shillings left as a Le∣gacy to the Church for this Religious purpose, by one who had formerly been Mayor of this City.</P>

<PB N="141" REF="77"/>
do lighten here their Burdens, and are con∣veyed up the River by Lighters and Barges drawn along by Horses into divers parts of the adjacent Counties: 'Tis a large Town, surrounded with a deep Trench, and for the most part Walled; the Streets are well paved and kept clean, and 'tis di∣vided by two small Rivers, over which there are Fifteen Bridges. It is called <HI>Old Lyn,</HI> and <HI>Linnum Regis,</HI> i. e. <HI>King's Lyn,</HI> though before the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth it was called <HI>Bishop's Lyn,</HI> be∣cause the Ground it stands upon belonged to the Bishops of <HI>Norwich</HI>: There are five Churches (with a Free-School) to adorn it, the chief of which is a curious Fabrick dedicated to St. <HI>Mar∣garet,</HI> upon the top of which stands a large and stately Lanthorn, very admirable for its rare Workmanship; and here is once a Year, about <HI>February,</HI> held a great Mart for all sorts of Com∣modities, by which no small Benefit accrues to it. The Town is governed by a Mayor and Alder∣men, who have received great Favours and Pri∣vileges from their Sovereigns, but their chief and most munificent Benefactor was King <HI>John,</HI> who for the good Service they had done him in the defence of his Quarrel, not only presented them with his own Sword from his side (which is con∣tinually carried before the Mayor, whenever he pleaseth to appear in State) but likewise gave them a great Silver Cup gilt, for the use of the Corporation; which because they shew as a main Badge and Cognizance of Royal Favour to all Strangers and Foreigners of any Note or Repute, they seldom produce it, unless filled with Wine to drink His Majesty's, and Mr. Mayor's Healths, for which there is a generous Allowance propor∣tioned by the Town.</P>
<P>We rested here one Night, but the next Day being summoned away by the Tide, whose Mo∣tions we were enforced to wait on and observe, we Ferried over into <HI>Mersh-Land,</HI> and posted
<PB N="142" REF="78"/>
away for the <HI>Washes,</HI> through which we were to pass into the Frontiers of <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Wash∣es.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Washes</HI> are called by <HI>Ptolemy, Metaris Aestu∣arium,</HI> being a very large Arm, which every Tide and high Sea covers over with Water, but when the Sea Ebbs, and the Tide is gone, 'tis as easie to pass over them, as upon dry Ground, though not without some danger for Strangers, who are unacquainted with their Tracts and Channels, which King <HI>John</HI> found true by woful Experience; for, whilst for the more speed he journeyed this way, when he was engaged in the War against the disaffected Barons, his Men not aware of such Irruptions, the Waters unexspectedly broke in up∣on them, by which means he lost all his Carriage and Furniture: Hereupon, to prevent all such un∣welcom Dangers, we hired a Guide to ride before us, by whose conduct we nimbly tripped over those dangerous Plains, and arrived safe at last out of these troublesom Territories of <HI>Neptune</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> which is one of the grand Divisions in <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lincoln∣shire.</NOTE>This County is of a large extent, and in most places very fertile and rich in Cattel; it stretcheth out it self no less than Threescore Miles in length, and above Thirty in breadth, and is divided into three Portions, called by the Names of <HI>Holland, Kesteven</HI> and <HI>Lindsey.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Holland.</NOTE><HI>Holland</HI> (so called, as some would have it, from <HI>Hay,</HI> which our Ancestors broadly term <HI>Hoy,</HI> is divided likewise into two parts, the Higher and the Lower; the Lower is a very moist and wa∣tery Soil, troublesom for its deep Fens, annoyed frequently with Quagmires, which in Summer∣time are so soft and pliable, that they will shake under a Man's Feet, who will be ready to sink in∣to them, as he stands upon them; in that Season it is all over covered with Sheep, as in the Winter with Water, at which time there is such a vast plenty of Fish and Fowl, that many poor People
<PB N="143" REF="78"/>
thereabouts make a good Livelihood by catching of them.</P>
<P>But as the Incomes are great, and the Profits con∣siderable of most Persons who inhabit these Fens, so are there some Inconveniences which are no less intolerable; for their Cattle being commonly a good distance from their Houses, they are forc'd in the Winter, when they go either to Fodder or Milk them, to betake themselves to their little Boats which they call Skirries, carrying usually two a-piece, and may be compared to an <HI>Indian</HI> Canoo, and by these convey themselves from place to place, as occasion requires; and because their Ground lies very low and flat, and East-ward adjoins to the main Ocean, lest at any time it should be over∣flown by any sudden Inundations, as in stormy Weather it too frequently happens, they fence in their Lands with great Piles of Wood, and migh∣ty Banks well lined and ramm'd down against the Violence of the Waves, and are forced to keep Watches with great care and diligence, as against the Approaches of a most dangerous Enemy; and yet, notwithstanding all their vigilance and fore∣cast, they can scarce with the strongest Barri∣cadoes, they can prepare, defend themselves from the violent Incursions and Outrages of the Sea.</P>
<P>Here is great plenty of Flax and Hemp, and in all these Parts many thousands of Sheep are fatted for the slaughter, but of good Bread and Water, which are the staff of Life, as great a scarcity, for the Water is generally brackish and ill relished, and the Bread as little pleasing and toothsom, be∣ing made for the most part of Pease and Oats, which yet goes down as favourily with the Pea∣sants, as if it had been moulded of finer Flour. Nor are their Dormitories any more pleasing or delightful, for all the Summer long there are con∣tinually such swarms of stinging Gnats, and other troublesom Flies throughout all these Quarters, that a Stranger can find but a very unhospitable

Lodging and Reception amongst those little buz∣zing Misanthropical Animals. Being loth there∣fore to lie at the mercy of such Enemies, or to come within the reach of their Bloody Inquisi∣tion, we made all the haste we conveniently could their troublesom Territories to <HI>Boston,</HI> which lying within the Precincts of Higher <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> we hoped to find more safe and inoffen∣sive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Boston.</NOTE>This is a famous Town, situated upon the Ri∣ver <HI>Witham,</HI> more properly named <HI>Botolph</HI>'s Town, from a great Saint <HI>Botolph,</HI> who had here formerly a Monastery; 'tis a place of great Note and Re∣pute for Merchandize, for the Sea flowing up the River causeth a very commodious Haven, so that many times here lie a Fleet of Ships, which con∣vey down Goods hither from all Parts; and the Mart which is kept here yearly doth much enrich the Town with all sorts of Commodities: There are fair and beautiful Houses seated on both sides of the River, over which is built a wooden Bridge of a great height, for the more easie converse and entercourse of the Inhabitants: The Market-place is fair and large, and on Market Days well stored with all kind of Provisions; and the Church be∣ing a most curious and stately Fabrick, is chiefly remarkable for its towring Steeple, which hath as many steps in it, from the top to the bottom, as there are Days in the Year, and doth not only salute all Travellers at a great distance, but is a good Sea-mark and Direction to all Sailors.</P>
<P>And it seems the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Countess of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Darby</HI> (of whose great Munificence I have formerly spoken) had a great kindness and e∣steem for this place, for the <HI>Margaret</HI> Preacher from <HI>Cambridge</HI> doth usually once in two Years come hither to give the Inhabitants a Sermon, for which service there is a particular Salary left in Legacy by that Lady.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="79"/>And whatever Damages it sustained formerly by the sudden Incursion of some bold and inso∣lent Ruffians, who coming clad cunningly in the Habits and Garb of Monks and Friars, broke into Merchants Houses, and plundered and pillaged them, and set Fire to the Town in sundry places in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the First; (so that, as our <HI>Chronicles</HI> tell us, Gold and Silver which was melt∣ed in the Flames ran down in as rapid a stream, as the like and other Metals did at the Sacking of <HI>Corinth</HI>) yet it hath since retrieved its Wealth, and recovered its strength, for the Inhabitants ad∣dicting themselves either to Merchandize, or Grazing, or both, have reduced it to a very opu∣lent and flourishing Condition; and 'tis now go∣verned by a Mayor and Aldermen, by whose prudent Conduct and Government it may, in all probability, long continue in that prosperous Estate. In the Coat of Arms for the Corporation there are three Crowns, relating to the three King∣doms; the Crest a Ram lying upon a Wooll-Sack, the Ram signifying the great Sheep-walks in the Fens round about, and the Wool-Sack that it was a Staple Town; the Supporters of the Coat are two Maremaids, signifying that it was a Port Town.</P>
<P>Reposing our selves here one Night, the next Day we travelled further into the Country, and passing over some part of the Fens, we came with∣in the limits of the second part of the County, called <HI>Kesteven</HI> (where as the Air is far more sweet and wholesome, so the Soil is no less rich and fruit∣ful) to a small Market Town named <HI>Sleeford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleeford.</NOTE> of little account, except it be by reason of an anci∣ent Castle built formerly by <HI>Alexander</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> or a House which was erected by Sir <HI>John Hussey,</HI> who in King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's Days lost his Head: And from hence coming to <HI>Lindsey,</HI> the other part, which is a Champaign Heath Country, we arrived at <HI>Lincoln,</HI> the most

But however, after his Death the <HI>Saxons</HI> got possession of it, and fortified them∣selves on the South-side of the Hill, about which time <HI>Paulinus,</HI> having preached the Gospel in <HI>Lindsey,</HI> was the first, that converted <HI>Blecca,</HI> the Governour hereof, to the Christian Faith, and erected a Church all of Stone-work, some of the Ruines whereof remain to this Day.

<P>In the former Ages of the Church, the Pre∣cincts of this Diocess were of so large an extent, that the greatness hereof became even burdensom to it; hereupon they were contracted into a nar∣rower compass by some Princes of this Nation; and though King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second took out of this the Diocess of <HI>Ely,</HI> and King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth the Bishopricks of <HI>Peterborough</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> yet still it is reputed the greatest Diocess of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> both for Jurisdiction and number of Shires,

there being no less than six Counties, and One thou∣sand two hundred forty seven Parish Churches, as is generally computed, belonging to it.</P>
<P>As for the Town, though it flourished mightily for some Years together after the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest, by reason of a Staple for wooll, and other Com∣modities setled here by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third; yet it met still with some Calamities or other, which hindred its Growth, and eclipsed its Gran∣deur for it had its share of Sufferings, both by Fire and War in King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s days about which time, it seems, though the King had at first been conquered, and taken Prisoner, yet he afterward en∣tred into the City in Triumph with his Crown up∣on his Head, to break the Citizens of a superstiti∣ous Opinion they held, that no King could possi∣bly enter into that City after such a manner, but some great disaster or other would befal him; but neither did it then, or by the Barons wars after∣wards sustain half the damages, which of late Years it hath received from the devouring Hands of Time, who hath wrought its downfal, and from a rich and populous City hath reduced it al∣most to the lowest ebb of Fortune, and of Fifty Churches, which were all standing within one or two Centuries, hath scarce left Fifteen; so that the old Proverbial Rhymes (which go currant amongst them) seem so far to have something of verity in them:

<P>From this City we set forward for <HI>Barton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barton.</NOTE> a small Town Situate upon the River <HI>Humber,</HI> fa∣mous for the abundance of <HI>Puits, Godwits, Knots</HI> (which are a sort of Bird so called, say some, from <HI>Canute</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> who perhaps brought them hither first from <HI>Denmark,</HI>) and likewise for <HI>Dottrels</HI> a sim∣ple kind of Bird much given to imitation; these <HI>Dottrels,</HI> are caught by candle-light after this man∣ner: The Fowler stands before the Bird, and if he puts out an Arm, the Bird stretcheth out a Wing; if he hold out his Head, or set forward his Leg, the Bird doth the like, and imitates the Fowlers gesture so long, till coming nearer and nearer by degrees, at length throws his Net over him, and so takes him.</P>
<P>Here we met with a convenient Passage to Fer∣ry over into <HI>York-shire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">York-shire.</NOTE> whereupon we took the first opportunity of Wind and Tide, and sailed away for <HI>Hull,</HI> which is about a League from the place on the other side of the River.</P>
<P>This County is the greatest in extent, being part∣ed into three Divisions, which are called the <HI>West-Riding,</HI> the <HI>East-Riding,</HI> and <HI>North-Riding,</HI> amongst

which Providence hath so wisely distributed her Blessings, that what one wants the other enjoys, and makes a compensation for the Barrenness of one part by the Fruitfulness of the other; if in one place 'tis craggy, and mountainous, in ano∣ther 'tis as Rich in Corn, and Pasture; and where the Woods do not shade in Summer, and make some provision for its Inhabitants against the Winter, she provides other kind of Fuel for them within the Bowels of the Earth, and by dispersing such varieties all over it renders it a very grateful and delectable Country.</P>

<P>In the late Civil Wars the <HI>Hothams,</HI> being deputed Governors of this place, kept this Garri∣son for the Pretended Parliament's Service, nor could all the importunity of the King or his Friends prevail with them to surrender it to his Majesty, till at last too late recanting their Actions and giving their own Party some cause to suspect their fidelity towards them, and their inclinations to be more favourable to the Royal Party, Ven∣geance laid hold upon both Sir <HI>John</HI> and his Son, and being summoned up above, when they least thought of Death, were sentenc'd to die by their own Friends, who having set them on work pay'd

<P>This place of great consequence is now under the Government of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> and the Inhabitants are still great Traders to <HI>New∣foundland</HI> for Fish and Oil; and in their <HI>Trinity-House,</HI> which is an Hospital for poor and impo∣tent Persons, they shew a little Boat with the Ef∣figies of a Wild Man, who, they say, was found therein many Leagues off at Sea, with a huge Jaw bone of a mighty Whale, both which they brought with them from the Northern Seas.</P>
<P>After we had pleased our selves with the vari∣ous Diversions of this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beverly.</NOTE> we withdrew from hence to a neighbouring Town called <HI>Beverly,</HI> supposed by <HI>Cambden</HI> to be the <HI>Petuaria Parisiorum,</HI> and is about seven or eight Miles further into tho Country, where <HI>John de Beverly,</HI> first of <HI>Hexham,</HI> afterward Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> a Man of great Learning and Piety, having resigned up his Bi∣shoprick, came and ended his Life in Solitariness and Contemplation. The Memorial of this Holy Man was so reverend and sacred to many Kings of this Island, especially to King <HI>Athelstan,</HI> who ho∣noured him as his Tutelary Saint, after the great∣est Conquest he had obtained over the <HI>Danes,</HI> that for his sake they endowed it with great and sin∣gular Privileges and Immunities, which it seems <HI>Athelstan</HI> did afterward enlarge, who came hither and offered his Knife at his Tomb: For in the Church, which is an ancient and goodly Structure built Cathedral-wise, is still to be read this In∣scription, engraven upon the West end of the Quire in old Characters:

<P><PB N="153" REF="83"/>Nor were there only Privileges granted to the Town, but even Foreigners did reap great Benefit hereby, by reason of an <HI>Asylum</HI> or Sanctuary, which was appointed for Persons who had com∣mitted any capital Crime; for here formerly stood an old Chair of <HI>Stone,</HI> which by its description did declare as much:
<Q>Haeo sedes lapidea Freed-Stool dicitur, <HI>i. e.</HI> Pacis Cathedra, ad quam Reus fugiendo perveniens omnimodam habet Securitatem.</Q></P>
<P>That is,
<Q>This Chair of Stone is called <HI>Freed-Stool, that is,</HI> the Chair of Peace, unto which whatsoever Offender fleeth or cometh, hath all manner of Security.</Q></P>
<P>In this Church there are some Monuments of great Note, particularly those which are erected in Honour of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who was slain at <HI>Chivy Chase</HI> in the Conflict with Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI> and of his Lady the Countess, over whom is placed on one side the Image of our Saviour Bap∣tizing an Infant, and on the other two Angels with our Lord in the middle, one of which holds the Cross, the Nails and the Hammer, which were the cruel Instruments of his Bloody Cruci∣fixion.

<P>The conflux of Foreigners was not formerly more remarkable here to promote the Merchan∣dize of <HI>Rome,</HI> than it is now, by reason of great Fairs and Markets, which have been granted to the Town, and especially for the great Mart, which in the Month of <HI>May</HI> holds constantly a Fort∣hight, which causing all kinds of Commodities to be brought hither, is no less advantageous to the Town than commodious to the Neighbourhood, who by this means may provide themselves of all

Necessaries at a very reasonable Rate: And for the better Government of the Town, a Mayor was placed here by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which keeps the Town in a good Decorum and Order.</P>
<P>We removed our Quarters from this place to <HI>York,</HI> which being the Metropolis of the County, as well as the Ornament and Safe-guard of the Northern Regions, is but one days Journey remote from it.</P>

<P>The River <HI>Ouse</HI> flowing with a gentle Stream from the North, divides the City into two Parts, which yet are conjoined by a strong Stone Bridge, consisting of five Arches, one of which is of so large a size, that it contains twice the breadth of any of the other: And round the City stands a thick and spacious Wall; and as on the West side 'tis fortified with a Wall and River together, and a great Gate, which is called <HI>Mikel Bar,</HI> near to which is the Mount called the <HI>Old Bale,</HI> raised and designed for a Fort by <HI>William Melton,</HI> Arch-Bishop of this See; so on the East side, opposite to the Mount, stands an ancient Castle built by <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> which is environ'd with a strong Wall and a deep Mote, over which is a Draw-Bridge, which gives entrance into it; here is usually a small Garrison supplied by a Regiment of Soldiers, which Quarters about the City, and hath some great Guns and Ammunition suitable for the Defence of it.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="84"/>Here are now but Seventeen Parish Churches, though formerly there were Thirty; and towards the North-East stands the Cathedral dedicated to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> being one of the most magnificent and stately Fabricks in our native Soil, near to which is the Prince's House, called commonly the Man∣nor-House. This Church was first Founded by <HI>Paulinus,</HI> who converted <HI>Edwyn,</HI> King of the <HI>Northumbers,</HI> and his People to the Christian Faith, about the Year 626. It was then a mean Oratory built only of Wood, but, as we are in∣formed by the <HI>Saxon Chronicle,</HI> the King consti∣tuting <HI>Paulinus</HI> the first Bishop of this See, order∣ed him to build a more ample Structure of Stone, but he dying before the whole was finished, it was at last compleated by <HI>Oswald</HI>; afterward, accord∣ing to the various Successes and Conquests of the Nation, it flourished or decayed till the Reign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> when a sudden Fire breaking out in the City, amongst other great Buildings consu∣med this too; together with a noble Library founded at first here by <HI>Egbert</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> from whence <HI>Alcuinus,</HI> the Preceptor of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, and Founder of the University of <HI>Paris,</HI> borrowed those Lights which have since glittered there, a Library which was stiled by the Men of those Days the <HI>Cabinet of Arts,</HI> and <HI>Closet of all the Liberal Sciences.</HI> In this forlorn Condition it continued, and lay buried in its Ashes till the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, when <HI>John Roman,</HI> Treasurer of the Church, laid the Foundation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter">The <HI>Notitia Mona∣stica</HI> informs us, That <HI>Thomas</HI> the first <HI>Nor∣man</HI> Arch-Bishop, <HI>A.

<P>As for the Windows, which convey Light to the whole Fabrick, they are very admirable for their Workmanship, all the Panes of Glass being exquisitely painted and adorned with most curious Colours; and in the East Window is pourtray'd to the Life the History of the Bible in very lively Representations.</P>
<P>The Isles of the Church are large and spacious, the Pillars strong and uniform, and the whole Body adorned with the Monuments of several Persons of Quality and Renown, who have lived and died in these Parts; amongst which is interred Mr. <HI>Swinborn,</HI> the great Civilian, who wrote con∣cerning Wills and Testaments, on whose Tomb this Epitaph is engraved.</P>

<P>In the Vestry upon the left hand is a little Well of pure Water, called St. <HI>Peter's-Well</HI>; in the times of Popery supposed to have been of great Virtue and Efficacy in charming Evil Spirits, and curing of Diseases, but it may be his Holiness, since the Extirpation of his Papal Authority in these Parts, hath laid an interdict upon its healing Faculty, since which time it hath ceased, no doubt in Reverence to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successor, from any such miraculous Operations.</P>
<P>The first Original of this Church's Metropolita∣nism was from Pope <HI>Honorius,</HI> at which time it had not only a Superiority over Twelve Bishopricks in <HI>England,</HI> but its Primacy was dilated over all the Bishops of <HI>Scotland</HI> too; but in process of time <HI>Scotland</HI> having exempted it self from its Jurisdicti∣on, other places likewise did the same, so that there are only now left four Bishopricks which are subject to this See, namely, <HI>Durham, Carlisle, Chester,</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> or <HI>Sodor</HI> in the <HI>Isle of Man</HI>: In∣deed there was afterward several private Grudges, Heart-burnings, and Contests betwixt <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York</HI> touching Precedency, Appeals, and some Ecclesiastical Privileges, but by a Decree of Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> they were quelled, who ordained that the Church of <HI>York</HI> should be subject to <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> and obey the Constitutions of that Arch-Bishop as Primate of all <HI>Britain,</HI> in such things as appertain to the Christian Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="86"/>But to return again from the Church into the City, we find it to have been a place of great An∣tiquity; for it was not only famous for the Se∣pulture of <HI>Eadbryth,</HI> King of the <HI>Northumbers,</HI> a∣bout the Year 738, together with his Brother <HI>Eg∣bert,</HI> Arch-Bishop of this See; and long before that time, of two greater and more renowned Emperors, <HI>Severns</HI> and <HI>Constantius</HI>; but likewise in that <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, after the Death of his Father, was first here in this place saluted and proclaimed Emperor by the Soldiers, at which time it appears to have been in great Repute and Estimation, till the <HI>Romans</HI> deserting it, left it a Prey to the barbarous Nations, so that not only the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> did depopulate and spoil it, but afterward the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> as they got Possession, still Ransack'd and laid it Waste; so that about the Year 867, it grew so extreamly weak, through the grievous Oppression of the <HI>Danes,</HI> that <HI>Osbright</HI> and <HI>Ella</HI> broke easily through the Walls thereof, and encountring there the <HI>Danes,</HI> were both slain in the Battel, the <HI>Danes</HI> remaining Masters of the City, saith the <HI>Saxon Chronicle,</HI> tho they lost it at last to <HI>Athelstan,</HI> in the year 928. Nor found it kinder Usage from the merciless <HI>Nor∣mans,</HI> who treated it no better than its former Ene∣mies had done; so that even till after King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Days there was little left in it, by reason of so many Calamities that befel it, but a small poor shadow of a great Name; but at last after sundry bitter Blasts, and troublesom Storms, which had grievously shaken and afflicted it, a sweet gale of peaceful Days began to refresh and enliven it, and in the space of a few Years it hereby became a Wonder to it self, and a Miracle to others, by reason of its prosperous Condition, and ever since it hath increased in Honour and Wealth, in Grandeur and Power, till at last it attained to that height of Greatness in which it is now esta∣blished.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="86"/>We diverted our selves for some Days in this Ci∣ty, where during our abode we had the Honour to be invited to the Lord Mayors House, who treat∣ed us with all the Civility imaginable; where I cannot omit to observe by the way, that there are no Gentlemen more affable, and Courteous, more Hospitable and Generous, more Obliging in their deportment and hearty in their entertainments, to all Strangers and foreigners, than the generality of the Gentry, who are every where dispersed through these Northen Climates.</P>
<P>The great satisfaction we met withal here made us hope for no less in the rest of our Northern tra∣vels, and giving us encouragement for a further Progress,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malton.</NOTE> we set forward from <HI>York</HI> to <HI>Malton</HI> a Market Town notable for the great resort of Jockeys, who flock thither in abundance to the Fair, that is held there every Year for Horses, 'tis watred by the River <HI>Rhie,</HI> and well frequented for Corn, Fish, and Instruments of Husbandry; and here are still to be seen the ruines of an old Castle belonging formerly to the <HI>Ʋrscies,</HI> who were an∣cient Barons in these Parts: and in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen</HI> here was built by <HI>Eustace</HI> a <HI>Gilbertine</HI> Priory, dedicated to the Honour of the <HI>Blessed Virgin.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we steered towards the Sea Coast, and came to <HI>Scarborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scarbo∣rough.</NOTE> a Town very eminent for its Spaw-water and Castle, where <HI>Pierce Gavaston,</HI> the great favourite of King <HI>Edward,</HI> the Second, was placed by the King to secure him from the Ba∣rons, whom he had so extreamly incensed, from which notwithstanding he was by force drawn away, and immediately beheaded by their Com∣mand and Order.</P>
<P>The Castle is Situated upon a Rock, of a won∣derful height and bigness, which by reason of its steep and craggy Cliffs is almost inaccessible, extend∣ing it self into the Sea, wherewith it is encompas∣sed, excepting on that Side which opens to the
<PB N="160" REF="87"/>
West, on the top it hath a very fair, green, and large Plain, containing diverse Acres of Ground, with three fresh Springs, one of which comes out of a Rock, and a Mill to grind Corn in case of a Siege; in the strait passage which leads up to it stands a high Tower, and beneath the said Passage stands the Town, spreading two sides North and South, but the fore-part Westward which is fenced on the front with a Wall of its own; on the East fortified by the Castle, wherein a Garrison is kept, and on both sides watered by the Sea: The Town is not very large, but conveniently built of Stone and Slate, and well inhabited, and stands bending upon the Brow of the Hill, and served for a Landmark to Ships off at Sea, till it was so much defaced in the late Civil Wars: It has a commodious Key, and enjoys a pretty good Trade.</P>
<P>About half a Mile from the Town near to the Sea is the Spring which they call the Spaw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaw.</HI></NOTE> of a very Medicinal and purgative Nature; what are the particular qualities and Mineral principles of this Well I leave to Physicians <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Dr. <HI>Simpson</HI> on this Subject.</NOTE> and Naturalists to discuss; but sure I am but the effects of this Water have been strange and wonderful, and ma∣ny Persons who in the Summer time resort hither to Drink it, do find great benefit and advantage by it.</P>
<P>From hence the Shore indented and interlaced with Rocks, bendeth in as far as the River <HI>Teese,</HI> and by a large compass which it fetcheth, there is made a <HI>Bay</HI> about a Mile broad, which from the Famous Outlaw <HI>Robin-Hood</HI> is called <HI>Robin-Hoods Bay:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Robin-Hoods Bay.</NOTE> Here is a small Village, but the most cele∣brated for the Fishing Trade: In all these parts, for here are caught great quantities of all sorts of Fish in their Seasons, which not only supply <HI>York,</HI> but all the adjacent Country, and hard by the Shore is a little Hully (as they call it) which is much like a great Chest, bored full of Holes to let in the
<PB N="161" REF="87"/>
Sea, which at high Water always overflows it, where are kept vast quantities of Crabbs and Lobsters, which they put in and take out again all the Season, according to the quickness or slowness of their Markets.</P>
<P>Here and all along this Coast are great plenty of Herrings; which, coming hither in Shoals out of the Northen Seas the beginning of <HI>August,</HI> are caught until <HI>November,</HI> not only by our own Fish∣ermen, but by <HI>Dutchmen</HI> too: Afterward they dis∣perse themselves into the <HI>British</HI> Sea, where they continue till <HI>Christmas,</HI> and then betake themselves to the <HI>Irish</HI> Coast, and after they have coasted round about <HI>Britain,</HI> away they hie into the Nor∣thern Ocean, as to their own proper home, where having setled and rested themselves a while till <HI>June,</HI> they cast their Spawn and bring forth a young Frie, and then return hither in innumerable companies, and so march constantly about these Islands.</P>
<P>The great quantity of Fish, which is here ta∣ken, causeth as great a cheapness throughout all the neighbourhood, and indeed we found every thing so plentiful and cheap in these parts, that a five Shillings Ordinary in many other places of <HI>England,</HI> would hardly produce what Sixpence or to be sure Twelvepence would here.</P>
<P>Four Miles further lies <HI>Whitbay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitbay.</NOTE> called by the <HI>Saxons</HI> of old Streaneshalh and Streonesheal, which probably might be taken, as the Learned Mr. <HI>Gibson</HI> observes in his <HI>Glossary,</HI> from the <HI>Saxon</HI> word <HI>Heale,</HI> which Signifies a Palace or Hall: It was formerly remarkable for a Monastery founded by St. <HI>Hilda,</HI> about <HI>A.

It was destroyed by the <HI>Danes,</HI> but reedified for <HI>Benedictine Monks,</HI> by <HI>William de Per∣cy,</HI> to the Honour of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Hilda, A. D.</HI> 1067. The Town has a convenient Harbour, that can receive Ships of considerable Burdens, and is famous for some Stones scattered here and

there (so atificially) and yet naturally round, that one would think they had been turned into Shot for small Ordnance; which take and break by heating them red hot in the Fire, and then quenching them with cold Water, and when the crust is fallen off, you will find, Stones wrapped, and folded up together in a Wreath, looking just like Snakes, or Serpents; Nature, as one speaks, disporting her self with the production of such <HI>Phenomena,</HI> and being wearied with more serious Works, shapes and forms such things by way of Sport and Recreation: We were presented with several of divers dimensions, and one might be apt to think they were little petrified Snakes, only they are headless, and are covered over some of them with a bright shining Coat, though others again appear of a more dark and dusky Colour. But it would argue great credulity and Surperstiti∣ous to attribute their Transformations to the Pray∣ers of St. <HI>Hilda,</HI> as it would be Folly or Levity to ascribe to her Holiness the sudden and immature Death of certain Wild geese, which in the Win∣ter, when they change their Air, and seek out for fresh Rivers, that are not frozen in the Southern Parts, by flying over some certain Fields adjoyn∣ing to this place (as is reported) suddenly fall down dead to the Ground, whereas this may be caus'd by some malignant Vapours arising from this Soil, which become very noxious and destructive to them.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Whitbay</HI> stands a little Village by the Sea side called <HI>Leith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leith.</NOTE> very Famous for some Alum Mines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alum Mines.</NOTE> which belong to the Earl of <HI>Mul∣grave</HI> now Marquess of <HI>Normanby:</HI> Here are abun∣dance of Labourers employed in this Service to dig and hew this out of a high Rock, which hangs over into the Sea; this Mineral is of the colour of Slate, of which when they have got a good quantity together, they burn it as we do Lime, till it changeth to a more ruddy Colour,
<PB N="163" REF="88"/>
afterward they steep it in pits of Water, which are digg'd for that purpose, and when it hath lain there as many Hours as is convenient, they convey it away in certain Pipes laid along the Ground to a House below the Rock, where it is afterward boil'd and clarified, as we find it; the Charge is great, and the Trouble unspeakable before it can be purified or re∣fin'd, as it ought; but the great Revenues and Profits that do amount from it, sufficiently countervail all Expences, and other inconveniencies that attend it.</P>
<P>From hence, all along the Shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Ra∣rities on this Shore, by <HI>Mul∣grave-Ca∣stle.</HI></NOTE> are dispersed other strange and wonderful Varieties, for by <HI>Mulgrave-Castle</HI> is often found Jet, and upon the same Shore are discovered Stones, some yellow, some reddish, some with a rough cast crust over them of a Salt Nature, which by their smell and taste make a shew of Copperas, Nitre, and Brimstone; and not far from <HI>Huntcliff</HI> appear certain Rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunt∣cliff.</NOTE> about which the <HI>Seal-fishes</HI> meet together to sleep and sun themselves, and upon that Rock which is next the Shore, one of the <HI>Seals</HI> lies to keep Sentry, and as any man approach∣eth, he either throws down a large Stone, or tum∣bles himself into the Water with a great noise, as a signal for all the rest to wake and get into the Water; they are not afraid of Women, but on∣ly Men, and therefore they that do catch them, commonly put, on Woman's apparel, and they say, that when they are chased by Men, if they be destitute of Water, they will with their hind Feet fling back a cloud of Sand and Gravel in the Faces and Eyes of the pursuers; yea, and many times drive them away, making them by this means weary of their designs.</P>

<P>After we had travelled some few Miles from hence, we came in little time within the Liberties of the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishoprick of <HI>Dur∣ham.</HI></NOTE> a County very rich in its Mountains, which are inlayed with Iron, Lead and Coals, and very fruitful in its Valleys with Grass and Corn. It was formerly the Patri∣mony of St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> who being Bishop of <HI>Lindis∣ferne,</HI> and afterward Patron of the Church of <HI>Dur∣ham,</HI> led a Life of such wonderful Piety and Holi∣ness, that he was Canonized for a Saint, and In∣vocated by some of the Kings and Princes of this Nation, as their Tutelary Saint and Protector against the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> who formerly did grie∣vously infest these Parts, upon which account up∣on him and his Successors was not only conferred and setled all the County between the <HI>Tees</HI> and the <HI>Tine,</HI> while he lived, but after his Death came divers Princes and other Potentates with the greatest Devotion imaginable in Pilgrimage to visit his Body, and offered at his Shrine an inesti∣mable Mass of Treasure: To which many other great Privileges and Immunities being daily added at the coming in of the <HI>Norman</HI> Conqueror, the Bishop was reputed for a Count Palatine, and did ingrave upon his Seal an Armed Knight holding a naked Sword in one hand, and the Bishops Arms in the other: Nay, it was once adjudged in Law, that this Bishop was to have Forfeitures and Es∣cheats within the Liberties, as the King had without; in short, the Bishops hereof have had the Royalties of Princes, having their own Courts of Judicature both for Civil and Criminal Causes, and Coining their own Coins: But these Royal∣ties have been since taken off in a great measure, and reannexed to the Crown. However the Bi∣shop is still Earl of <HI>Sadberg,</HI> a place in this Bishop∣rick, and takes place in the Episcopal College next to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> but he is subordinate to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="90"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Darling∣ton.</NOTE>We took up our first Station at <HI>Darlington</HI> on the <HI>Skerne,</HI> over which it hath a Stone-Bridge: 'Tis a Market-Town of good resort, which <HI>Seir,</HI> an <HI>English-Saxon,</HI> the Son of <HI>Ʋlph,</HI> having obtain∣ed leave of King <HI>Ethelred,</HI> gave unto the Church of <HI>Durham,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Pudsey</HI> adorned it with a fair Church and other Edifices.

That these Pits have Passages under Ground was first experi∣mented, they say, by Bishop <HI>Tunstall,</HI> who, to satisfie his Curiosity herein, marked a Goose, and let her down into them, which very Goose he found afterwards in the River <HI>Tees,</HI> which runs along not far from this place.</P>

that are any way befitting so Sacred a place; and the Plate which was bestowed upon it, by him, for religious Uses was of a great value: Nor was his Charity confined at home, but dispersed and diffused it self as liberally abroad, having erected here an Alms-House, as he did likewise another at <HI>Durham</HI> for divers poor People, for whom he hath allotted a comfortable subsistence. He erect∣ed at <HI>Durham</HI> a Library very spacious and uniform, to which he bequeathed several Volumes of choice Books; he raised there a new Structure for the use of the Country, in which are held the Assizes and Sessions; he made the Castle, (formerly built by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror) which was quite gone to Ruin, very useful again, and magnificent; be∣sides all this, he gave some new Fellowships and Exhibitions to St. <HI>Peter's-College</HI> in <HI>Cambrige,</HI> where himself had been Master: He expended vast Sums of Money in publick Benevolences to the King, in redeeming Christian Captives at <HI>Algiers,</HI> in re∣lieving the distressed Loyal Subjects, and in many other publick and pious Uses: So that both the City and Country have sufficient reason gratefully to remember him, and to wish that such Prelates may continually succeed him, who may approve themselves such Worthy Fathers of the Church, such Noble Patrons to their Country, and such Glorious Pillars of Religion.</P>
<P>Some three or four Miles distance from this Place is <HI>Binchester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Binche∣ster.</NOTE> now a small Village of little repute, save for its relicts of old Walls and pieces of <HI>Roman</HI> Coin often digged up, here called <HI>Bin∣chester Pennies,</HI> by which it appears to have been formerly an eminent Station of the <HI>Romans,</HI> though now 'tis nothing but a rude heap of Rubbish: And about the same distance from <HI>Binchester</HI> stands <HI>Durham,</HI> the most flourishing and principal City of this Province.</P>
<P><HI>Durham</HI> is a City whose Situation is upon Hills and bottoms of Hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Durham.</NOTE> and all surrounded with

Hills, but the lower parts watered by the River <HI>Ware,</HI> which encircles the best part of it, and over which there are two Stone Bridges, so that it is a Peninsula, which <HI>Dunholme,</HI> a name by which it was formerly called, doth denote, for the <HI>Saxons</HI> called an Hill <HI>Dun,</HI> and a River-Island <HI>Holme,</HI> from whence the <HI>Latins</HI> have made <HI>Dunelmum,</HI> the <HI>Normans Duresme,</HI> and the Commonalty corruptly <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>The Town is pretty large, but of no great Beauty, nor seems to bear any considerable stamp of Antiquity, but to have received its first Ori∣ginal from the distressed Monks of <HI>Lindisferne,</HI> who being driven thence by the Fury of the <HI>Danes</HI> came hither with the Body of St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> which they preserved with great care, and honoured with the greatest Veneration imaginable; at which time the See being removed hither by Bishop <HI>Aldwin, A.

<P>Now how it came to pass that <HI>Bede</HI> obtain'd this Title of <HI>Venerabilis,</HI> the Learned Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> in his Geography gives us a very pleasant Relation, con∣cerning which, saith he, the Legend tells us, that being Blind, his Boy had Knavishly condu∣cted him to Preach to a heap of Stones, and that when he had ended his Sermon with <HI>Gloria Pa∣tri,</HI> the very Stones concluded and said, <HI>Amen, Amen, Venerabilis Beda.</HI> But others of the Monk∣ish Writers do assign this reason, and both true alike, that at his Death some unlearned Priest in∣tending to honour him with an Epitaph, had thus far blundred out a Verse, <HI>Hac sunt in fossa Bedae —Ossa,</HI> but because the Verse was yet imper∣fect, he went to Bed to consider of it, leaving a space betwixt the two last words thereof, which in the Morning he found fill'd up in a strange Cha∣racter with the word <HI>Venerabilis,</HI> and so he made his Verse, and <HI>Bede</HI> obtained his Title.</P>
<P>To this Church, which for decency in all pub∣lick Administrations, for Order of its Attendants, and Beauty of Ornaments gives place to none, being adorned with such curious Tapestry, and costly Plate, and rich Copes, and melodious Mu∣sick of all sorts, which as well captivates the Eyes, as enravisheth the Hearts of all devout and pious Christians, belong a Dean, two Arch-Deacons, and twelve Prebendaries, Men of great Learning and Worth, who have each a very convenient House allotted them in the College-Yard adjoin∣ing to the Cathedral, were, during their residence, which they keep by turns every Month; they

<P>After some respite and diversion in this City, we marched on to <HI>Chester upon the Street,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chester, <HI>on the</HI> Street, <HI>alias</HI> Cun∣cacester.</NOTE> a Village very venerable for its remains of Antiquity, for 'tis credibly believed to have been a Garrison of the <HI>Romans,</HI> where the first Wing of the <HI>Astures</HI> kept their Station: and it hath been famous for the Body of St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> brought hither, and kept obscurely by the Bishops of <HI>Lindisferne,</HI> who re∣tired to this place to secure themselves from the blustring Storms of the <HI>Danish</HI> Fury; in memory whereof when <HI>Aegelric,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> laid the Foundation of a new Church in that place, he found such a vast and rich Treasure buried in the Ground, as is supposed by the <HI>Romans,</HI> that growing exceedingly Rich and Wealthy, he re∣signed up his Bishoprick, and returned to <HI>Peter∣borough,</HI> where he had formerly been Abbot, and became a generous Benefactor to the Fen-Country thereabouts<NOTE PLACE="marg">Angl.

<P><PB N="171" REF="92"/>From hence the Road led us directly to <HI>Gates∣head,</HI> the utmost limits of this Province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gates∣head.</NOTE> which standing on the hither side of the River <HI>Tine,</HI> hath in all probability been a great Colony of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> and was called by the Latins <HI>Capreae Caput, i. e. Goats Head,</HI> by occasion of some Inn, as is generally conjectured, which had a Goats Head for a Sign, a thing not unusual in other places of the World. Certain it is, that all Historians name this place <HI>Capreae Caput,</HI> when they give us an account of the Tragical end of <HI>Walter</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> who being placed here by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, as his Substitute and Vice-gerent, became a victim to the Fury of the enraged Mul∣titude, and was slain in this place upon some great distast which they took to his Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>From <HI>Gateshead</HI> there is a large Stone-Bridge built over the <HI>Tine,</HI> a Town large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Newca∣stle <HI>upon</HI> Tine.</NOTE> populous and rich, and is the chief place for Trade in all the Northern Parts, being enobled by a notable Haven of so great a depth, that it receives Vessels of very considerable Burthens, and is so safe a Harbour, that all Ships find here a sure Ancho∣rage, without receiving any prejudice or damage by stress of Weather: The Towns stands high and low, part upon a Hill, and part in the bot∣tom of it near the River, the Streets upon the ascent are exceeding steep, the Houses most of Stone, some Timber, and a few of Brick; it consists of four large Parishes with as many Pa∣rish Churches, the principal whereof dedicated to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> stands very lofty on the top of the Hill, and looks more like a Cathedral, than a Parish Church, with a fair Steeple of curious Ar∣chitecture, besides which it is adorned with a con∣venient Market, a handsome Town-House, and an useful Key.</P>
<P>Through this Town went part of that Wall, which ran along from Sea to Sea, and was built
<PB N="172" REF="93"/>
by the <HI>Romans</HI> to defend the <HI>Britains</HI> against the violent Incursions and Depopulations of the <HI>Picts</HI>; and at <HI>Pandon-Gate</HI> there remains, as is thought, one of the Turrets of that Wall, differing much from the other Gates of the Town in shape and Workmanship: And though formerly it had the Name of <HI>Monks-Chester,</HI> yet after the Conquest, when <HI>Robert,</HI> Son to <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, had raised here a new Fort to keep off the <HI>Scots,</HI> it got the Name of <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tine,</HI> to distinguish it from <HI>Newcastle</HI> under <HI>Line</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire.</HI></P>
<P>In the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First, when the <HI>Scots</HI> came hither and infested these Parts, they took away Prisoner out of this Town a very opulent Person, who having ransom'd himself for a great Sum of Money, no sooner returned home but he began immediately to fortifie the Town, which the rest of the Inhabitants joining with him, in a short time they environed it with a strong and spacious Wall, since which time it hath not only been enabled much better to defend it self against all its Enemies, but is become a place so considerable for all Merchandize, that divers great Fleets of Ships go every Year laden from hence with many Chauldron of Coals, and return home in lieu of them other rich Commodities: And as its Commerce is great, so its Privileges are as renown'd, for our <HI>English</HI> Monarchs have ever afforded it all possible Encouragement, for <HI>Richard</HI> the Second made it a Corporation, and ordered a Sword to be carried before the Mayor, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth enlarged its Charter, by making it like∣wise a County Incorporate, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> still made more honourable Additions to it.</P>
<P>During our abode in this place we took a pair of Oars and went down in a Wherry to view <HI>Tinmouth</HI> Castle, which is about two Leagues from it.</P>
<P>As we passed along we found the River <HI>Tine</HI> very navigable and commodious, till we came to
<PB N="173" REF="93"/>
the Mouth, where it empties and disembogues it self into the Sea, and indeed 'tis there rocky and dan∣gerous, for there stands two Rocks opposite to each other, upon which if a Ship happen to touch, she is in danger of being quite lost, so that the Saylors are forced to steer carefully through this dangerous gulph, and if it be foul weather or Night, when they come near it, keep off at Sea, till a fair opportunity present it self for their passage.</P>
<P>Upon the Mouth of the River is situated the Castle, which commands the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tin∣mouth-<HI>Castle.</HI></NOTE> and defends the River; on the North and East side it can no way be stormed, by reason of a high Rock, which reaching forth into the Sea, doth render it inacces∣sible; and in the other parts 'tis of so excessive a height, and so well provided with great Guns and Ammunition, that a small handful of Men may be able to hold it out against the violent as∣saults of a very potent Enemy: upon which ac∣count <HI>Robert Mowbray,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> when he rebelled against King <HI>William Rufus,</HI> made choise of this place, as the most convenient Fortress to secure himself against the King's For∣ces; who notwithstanding besieged him so closely and blocked up all Avenues by which any Provisi∣on might be conveyed to him, that he was enfor∣ced to Steal away to a neighbouring Monastry of <HI>Benedictine Monks,</HI> founded by himself to the Ho∣nour of St. <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Oswyn,</HI> who, though an <HI>Asylum</HI> or Sanctuary for Delinquents, could not secure his Person from the Soldiers, who carried him away Captive to his injur'd Prince, from whom he received a just Reward of his Treach∣ery.</P>
<P>On the other side of the River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheals.</NOTE> almost opposite to the Castle, is <HI>Sheals,</HI> a village very eminent for its Salt-Pans, where great quantity of Salt is boil'd and made, and on the Banks on both sides are
<PB N="174" REF="94"/>
many convenient Houses for the Entertainment of Seamen and Habitation of Colliers: And as here usually most of the <HI>Newcastle</HI> Coal-fleet keep their Station, so not far from hence stands <HI>Jarrow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jarrow.</NOTE> for nothing so remarkable, as for being the Birth∣place of Venerable <HI>Bede.</HI></P>
<P>After we came ashore, we prepared for a fur∣ther progress into these Northern Climates, but travelling along we found the most fertile part of <HI>Northumberland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor∣thumber∣land.</NOTE> which borders upon the <HI>Time,</HI> to be left behind us, for that rest appeared very rough and barren; and as the Country is Mountainous, so the Inhabitants are generally Fierce and Hardy, participating in some measure of the nature of the Soil; and as they are Stout, so it seems they are long liv'd, as appears from a Story, which is rela∣ted of one Mr. <HI>Macklain,</HI> Parson of <HI>Lesbury,</HI> who died in the Year 1659. It seems that two Years before, in the Year 1657, he did renew his Youth, so that though for Forty Years before he could not read without spectacles, being then 116 Years old, he would read the smallest Print without them, and had his Hair, which he had lost, come again like a Childs, which puts me in Mind of an aged Dean, which had the like Renovation of Age, and when he died, had this Epitaph bestowed upon him by some barbarous Pen.</P>

The boundaries of this Wall were very large, extending even from Sea to Sea, and contained in length, as is probably computed, a∣bove Fourscore Miles; and he who is curious to know the direct tract thereof, let him consult <HI>Cambden</HI>'s <HI>Britannia,</HI> where he will find a very full and exact account of it.</P>
<P>But to return again on our way, coming to <HI>Morpeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Morpeth.</NOTE> a goodly Market-Town with a Castle, on the River <HI>Wensbech,</HI> lying in the great Road which leads to <HI>Scotland,</HI> we were here very gene∣rously entertained by some Friends, who conduct∣ed us afterward in the way towards <HI>Warkworth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hermi∣tage by <HI>Wark∣worth.</HI></NOTE> where having visited an ancient Hermitage by the River <HI>Coquet,</HI> made out of a Rock, in which is a litttle Chapel hewn out of it likewise, where the Stones do appear to be worn by the frequent Prostrations of some Superstitious Papists, who fre∣quently repair hither out of a pretended Zeal and Devotion; we rode away for <HI>Alnewick,</HI> which is a¦bout four Miles distance from this Religious Cell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alne∣wick.</NOTE></P>

After this, in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, the <HI>English</HI> Forces behaved themselves so bravely, that they took Prisoner <HI>William</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and pre∣sented him as a Captive to their Victorious Prince, having fortified this place with a strong Garrison; and in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth the <HI>Scots</HI> coming against it with another Army, were in hopes to have taken it, but the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Army retreating, as if they had deserted it, by that means discouraged the <HI>Scots</HI> from any fur∣ther Onsets, who supposing it to have been a Stra∣tagem of the <HI>English,</HI> and that they had only re∣treated <HI>Scythico more,</HI> the more easily to entrap them, very fairly left it to the possession of those Persons, in which at first they found it.</P>

<P>About a League from this Castle we saw <HI>Farne-Island,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Farne-Island.</NOTE> being a little spot of Land inclosed with the Ocean, and encircled about with craggy Cliffs, which render it almost every where inaccessible: Hither did St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> about the Year 676, retire from <HI>Lindisfarne</HI> for Devotion, desiring to sequester himself from the rest of the World, where for nine Years together he lived a very solitary and reli∣gious Life, till by the great importunity of King <HI>Eegfrid,</HI> and <HI>Trumwine,</HI> Bishop of the <HI>Picts,</HI> who came hither to him for that very intent and pur∣pose, he was at last persuaded to remove to <HI>Hex∣ham,</HI> where he succeeded Bishop <HI>Eata</HI> in that See: After two Years spent in this Bishoprick, this Holy Man foreseeing his Death approaching, be∣took himself again to this very Island, where in the space of two Months, through the Malignan∣cy of his Distemper, he at last breathed out his pious Soul on the 20th of <HI>March, A.

of which here the Fishermen make a considerable advantage, by selling them abroad to the Neigh∣bourhood; they are of all sizes and colours; we saw some that were much speckled, about the big∣ness of Hens Eggs, and some larger than the Eggs of our ordinary Turkeys and Geese, but both were no less pleasing and grateful to the Palate: As to the Air of this place, whatever it was for∣merly, it is now reputed very unhealthy, subject to the Dysentery or Bloody Flux, and other Dis∣eases, by reason of the frequent Fogs that happen here; and 'tis no less troubled with Tempests of Wind, Storms of Rain, and Rage of the Sea; the Soil is barren and good for little, but what is got∣ten from the Fowl, and the Fish which swim in shoals round about it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Berwick <HI>upon</HI> Tweed.</NOTE>We coasted on for <HI>Berwick,</HI> which is one of the strongest Holds in all <HI>Britain,</HI> and is almost envi∣roned with the Sea and the River <HI>Tweed</HI>; whence the Town took its name is not so well agreed up∣on, as that 'tis a large and populous Town, well Built, and strongly Fortified; 'tis situated betwixt the two great Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and hereupon was always the first place they took care of, whenever they began to be at open va∣riance with each other; and, according to the various and inconstant Successes ef each Nation, hath been held in possession by one, and some∣times kept under the power of the other. Before the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second we find little or no∣thing Recorded of it, for <HI>William</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> being taken Prisoner by the <HI>English,</HI> did first sur∣render it into King <HI>Henry</HI>'s hands upon condition, that unless by such a day he paid the Ransom that was demanded for his Liberty, it should always belong to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> hereupon the King built a Castle to strengthen it, all which was afterward released to the <HI>Scots</HI> by King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, upon the payment of that Money which before had been promised.

upon a great distast he took against the <HI>Northum∣bers,</HI> for doing homage to the <HI>Scotch</HI> King, won it again; and not many Years after, when <HI>Baliol</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> had violated his Oath, King <HI>Edward</HI> the First brought it under his Subjection, yet with∣in a while after, when the Fortune of the War began to smile upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> it was unawares surprized, but in a few days the <HI>English</HI> regained it; afterward, in that loose Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, it was betrayed to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and for a long time after it was in vain besieged by the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Forces, until King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, that most Puissant Prince, came thundering against it, and forced his entrance: Notwithstanding in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, the Castle was sur∣prized by certain <HI>Scotch</HI> Robbers, but they could not hold it long, for the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> in a few days dislodged them of their Fortress. Scarce seven Years were over passed, when the <HI>Scots</HI> re∣covered it again, not by force, but by Money, for which cause the aforesaid Earl was Impeached of High Treason, but he being a very politick Man, corrupted both their Faith and their Forti∣tude, and straitway restored it to the <HI>English</HI> Crown. A great while after, when <HI>England</HI> was embroiled in Civil Wars, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth flying into that Kingdom for refuge, surrendred it up into the hands of that King, to secure him his Life and Safety in that Country; but many Years were not expired before Sir <HI>Thomas Stanley</HI> did again reduce it under the command of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, but not without a great loss of his Men, and much Blood spilt about its Walls; since which our Kings have been still strengthen∣ing it with new Fortifications, especially Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who to the Terrour of the <HI>Scots</HI> and Safe-guard of this Nation, enclosed it about in a narrower compass within the old Wall, with a high Wall of Stone most strongly compacted, which she hath so forwarded again with a Couter∣scarp,

a Bank round about, with Mounts of Earth cast up on high, and open Terraces above-head, upon all which are planted a double tire of great Ordnance; that when the <HI>Scots</HI> entred <HI>England</HI> in 1640, they took <HI>Newcastle,</HI> but durst not at∣tempt <HI>Berwick.</HI> In this place is still maintained a constant Garrison of Soldiers, and the Guards which are placed at the foot of the Bridge which is built over the <HI>Tweed,</HI> do every Night pull up the Draw-Bridges, and lock up the Gates, which give entrance into the Town, so that there is no admission when once the day is gone.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tweed.</NOTE>All along the <HI>Tweed</HI> is notable Fishing for Sal∣mons, of which there is such great store and plenty in this River, that they take vast numbers at one draught, as we were credibly informed by the Fishermen of this place, who hire out the Fishery from the Lords of the River, and have each Man his Bounds set out and mark'd for him: The Salmon, which they catch, are dried, barrelled up, and transported beyond Seas, and are purcha∣sed at such easie and cheap Rates, that a Man may buy one of the largest for a Shilling, and boil it, and eat it while the Heart is yet alive, a thing which is frequently practised in this place; nay, they are so common about these Parts, that the Servants, as they say, do usually indent with their Masters, when they hire them, to feed them with this Fish only some Days in the Week, that they may not be nauseated by too often eating of it; but as for all other Provisions they are scarce enough here, and dearer than in any other parts of the North; so that he that first called <HI>Berwick</HI> the little Purga∣tory betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> by reason of the hard Usage and Exactions which are custo∣mary here, did confer upon it a very just and de∣served Title.</P>

<P>These Borders have been formerly of a far greater extent, reaching as far as <HI>Edinburgh-Frith</HI> and <HI>Dunbritton</HI> Northward, and taking in the Counties of <HI>Northumberland, Cumberland</HI> and <HI>West∣morland</HI> Southward; but since the <HI>Norman</HI> Con∣quest, they have been bounded by <HI>Tweed</HI> on the East, <HI>Solway</HI> on the West, and the <HI>Cheuiot</HI> Hills in the midst.</P>

<P>These are subdivided again according to their Civil Government into divers Seneschallies, or Sheriffdoms, which are commonly Hereditary, and the People, which inhabit each, are called <HI>High-landers</HI> and <HI>Low-landers</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Highlanders,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">High-landers.</NOTE> who inhabit the West part of the Country, in their Language, Habit and Man∣ners agree much with the Customs of the Wild <HI>Irish,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elgin.</NOTE> and their chief City is <HI>Elgin</HI> in the County of <HI>Murray,</HI> seated upon the Water of <HI>Lossy,</HI> for∣merly the Bishop of <HI>Murray</HI>'s Seat, with a Church sumptuosly built, but now gone to decay. They go habited in Mantles striped, or streaked with divers colours about their Shoulders, which they call <HI>Plodden,</HI> with a Coat girt close to their Bodies, and commonly are naked upon their Legs, but wear Sandals upon the Soles of their Feet, and their Women go clad much after the same Fashi∣on: They get their Living mostly by Hunting, Fishing, and Fowling; and when they go to War, the Armour wherewith they cover their Bodies, is a Morion or Bonnet of Iron, and an Ha∣bergeon, which comes down almost to their very Heels; their Weapons against their Enemies are Bows and Arrows, and they are generally reputed
<PB N="184" REF="99"/>
good Marks Men upon all occasions; their Ar∣rows for the most part are barbed or crooked, which once entred within the Body cannot well be drawn out again, unless the Wound be made wider; some of them fight with broad Swords and Axes, and in the room of a Drum make use of a Bag-pipe. They delight much in Musick, but chiefly in Harps and Clarishoes of their own Fashion, the strings of which are made of Brass-Wire, and the strings of their Harps with Sinews, which strings they strike either with their Nails growing long, or else with an Instrument ap∣pointed for that use: They take great delight to deck their Harps and Clarishoes with Silver and precious Stones; and poor ones that cannot at∣tain thereto deck them with Crystal: They sing some Verses very prettily put together, containing for the most part Praises of valiant Men, and there is not almost any other Argument of which their Rhimes are composed: They are great lovers of Tobacco, and a little Mundungo will make them at any time very serviceable and officious; and as they are mostly tall and strong, they are likewise so exceeding fleet, that some of them will make nothing of it to run many Miles in a day upon an Errand, and return back again with no less Expe∣dition.</P>

<HI>Feids,</HI> and were reduced by the Princely Care and Prudence of King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth. To this pur∣pose I have read a very remarkable Story in the Life of <HI>Robert</HI> the Third, King of <HI>Scots,</HI> how that a dangerous Feud falling out betwixt two great and populous Families in the North, <HI>Thomas Dun∣bar</HI> Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> and <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Craford</HI> were sent to reduce them, who, perceiving the great Mischief likely to attend their endeavours of a forcible reducement, contrived a more subtle way to quiet them; after a representation made to the Heads of those Clans, a part, of the danger of those mutual Feuds, and of the King's Wrath against both, they advise to conclude their Feuds, as the <HI>Horatii</HI> and <HI>Curatii</HI> did at <HI>Rome,</HI> by the choice not of three, but of three hundred on each side to fight, armed with Swords only, in the sight of the King and his Nobles, whereby the Victor should gain Honour, and the Vanquish'd Safety from further Punishment, and both regain his Majesty's Favour, whereof they gave them full assurance; the Proposition is embraced, on both sides of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Town Mounts raised, and Gal∣leries made for the accommodation of the Specta∣tors, the Combatants are chosen, and on the day appointed, together with a multitude of Beholders, all of them appear upon the place, only one through fear privately withdrew himself; this put some delay to the Encounter, the one Party look∣ing on it as a dishonour to fight with the other wanting one of their number, the other Party not finding one who would engage himself to make up the number, desire one of the Three hundred to be put aside, but of all that number not one could be enduced to withdraw, accounting it an indelible Disgrace to be shufled out of such a choice Company of valorous Men: At last an ordinary Trades-man tendreth his Service, desiring no greater Reward than one single piece of Gold in hand, as an honourable Badge of his Valour, and
<PB N="186" REF="100"/>
an Annuity of a small Sum for Life should he sur∣vive the Combat; his Demands are soon granted, and immediately beginneth the Conflict with as much fury as the height of Wrath, the insatiable desire of Honour, and the fear of Shame, more than the fear of Death, could produce, to the Horror and Amazement of the Spectators, whose Hearts tremble within them to see (as indeed it was a horrid Spectacle to behold) such a ruful sight of furious Men butchering one another; and observed it was by all, that of all the Combatants none shewed more, shall I call it Valour, than the Trades-man did, who had the good Fate to survive that dismal Day, and on the Conquering side too, whereof only ten besides himself outlived that Hour to partake with many ghastly Wounds the Honour of the Day; the Vanquished are kil∣led on the place all to one, who perceiving him∣self to be left alone, and being without Wounds, he skippeth into the River, by which means none of the surviving Victors being able to follow him, by reason of their Wounds, he makes a fair escape with his Life. Thus the Heads and most turbu∣lent of both Clans being cut off, their Retainers are soon persuaded to Peace, and so for many Years after live quiet enough. This Fight hap∣pened in the Year 1396.</P>
<P>The other Custom was that of Nature, that the like was scarce heard amongst the Heathens, and much less in Christendom, which did begin, as the <HI>Scotch</HI> Historians affirm, in the Reign of <HI>Ewen</HI> the Third, which <HI>Ewen</HI> being a Prince much ad∣dicted, or rather given up altogether to Lascivi∣ousness, made a Law that himself and his Succes∣sors should have the Maidenheads or first Night Lodging with any Woman, whose Husbands held Land immediately from the Crown, and the Lords and Gentlemen likewise of all those whose Husbands were their Tenants or Homagers; this was it seems the Knights Service which Men held

of her Hair, tho' I find by some we brought away with us, that in process of time it looseth all its sweetness.

But so far is the most Learned Bishop <HI>Stilling-fleet</HI> from giving any Cre∣dit to this Story, that he looks upon it only as an Invention of the Monks of <HI>Glassenbury</HI> to serve their Interests, by advancing the Reputation of their Monastery, and instead of <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arima∣thea,</HI> or <HI>Simon Zelotes,</HI> or <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s coming hither, he very rationally shews us, how St. <HI>Paul</HI> is rather to be looked upon as the first Founder of a Christian Church in <HI>Britain</HI>; and that there was Encouragement and Invitation enough for St. <HI>Paul</HI> to come hither, not only from the infinite num∣bers of People which <HI>Caesar</HI> saith were here in his time, but from the new Settlements that were dai∣ly making here by the <HI>Romans</HI> after the first Suc∣cess, which they had in the Time of <HI>Claudius,</HI> when divers Colonies were drawn over hither. Here was also the first Monastery in <HI>England,</HI> Founded by St. <HI>Patrick, A.

<P>From <HI>Glassenbury</HI> we rode to <HI>Taunton</HI> q. <HI>Thonton</HI> from the River <HI>Thone,</HI> which runneth through it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Taunton.</NOTE> a large, neat and Populous Town, pleasantly situated, beautified with fair Houses, and goodly Churches, and a spatious Market-place, enriched with fertile Mea∣dows, and adorned with curious Gardens and Or∣chards, 'tis mostly inhabited by Clothiers driving a good Trade in Cloath and Serges made here and in the adjacent parts; here was formerly an old Castle built by King <HI>Ina,</HI> which Queen <HI>Aethelburga</HI> de∣stroyed <HI>A.

<P>Passing through <HI>Wellington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Welling¦ton <HI>and</HI> Co∣lumpton <HI>in</HI> De∣vonshire.</NOTE> another Market Town in this County, the Road then led us to <HI>Columpton,</HI> a small market Town in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> which King <HI>Alfred</HI> by Will bequeathed to his younger Son.</P>
<P>In <HI>Devonshire</HI> the Air is sharp and wholesome, the Land if not in some places so fruitful, yet through the Husband-mans industry is made capa∣ble of good emprovement; its chief Commodi∣ties are Wool and Kersies, Sea Fish and Fowl, and the Western parts are stored with Tin and Lead Mines, and Load-stones have been found upon <HI>Dartmoor</HI> Rocks of good value and virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="124"/>The People of this Country are strong and well made, and as they have a peculiar sort of Food, which they call White-pots, so the Women have a peculiar sort of Garment, which they wear upon their Shoulders called Whittles, they are like Mantles with fringes about the edges, without which the common sort never ride to Market, nor appear in publick.</P>
<P>In diverse places of this County the ways are so Rocky and narrow, that 'tis not possible for Waggons to pass, so that the Country People are forced in Harvest time to carry home their Corn upon Horses, in Crooks made for that purpose, which creates no small Toil and Labour to them.</P>

<P>In the same quarter of the City stands the Cathe∣dral in the precincts of whose close were in ancient times three Religious Houses, as the Ingenious Mr. <HI>Tanner's Notitia Monastica</HI> doth inform us; the first was a Nunnery which is now the <HI>Deans</HI> House, the other was a House of Monks reported to have been built by King <HI>Ethelred</HI> about <HI>A.

and furnished by a Phisitian of this City; the Quire is curiously beautified and adorned especially with an excellent Organ, the Pipes whereof as they are of a much larger size, than any which ever we be∣held in any Cathedral besides, so likewise is its Mu∣sick no less sweet, and harmonious, and though this Church did through all its parts extreamly suffer in the late unhappy Civil Wars, yet it hath return∣ed to its primitive beauty, and order, since the return of King <HI>Charles</HI> the second; in this Church, as likewise in most of the other Churches and Church-yards of the City, the Graves, especially of the Wealthier sort, are paved all over on the inside with Bricks, and plaistered with white Lime, where after they have interred the Corps, all the company in general, who were invited to the Fu∣neral, return to the House of Mourning, from whence they came and there very ceremoniously take their leave of the party, by whom they were invited to perform these doleful obsequies.</P>
<P>On the West side of the City runs the River, over which is built a strong Stone Bridge with four Arches, and about the middle of the City is the Town Hall, where the Assizes and Sessions are held, it being both City and County of it self, in which hangs the Picture of the Royal Princess <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> Daughter to King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, who was Born here, and was given by her Royal Brother King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second to this City, which is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, two Sheriffs, and four and Twenty Aldermen, with all other Officers befitting the Dignity of so Honourable a place: The chief Trade of it con∣sists in Stuffs, and Kerseys, of which there are innumerable Packs sent away every Week for <HI>London,</HI> and other places, in lieu whereof all sorts of vendible Commodities are imported hither, here being a knot of very eminent Merchants.</P>

to the fury both of Fire and Sword, the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> had it in possession about the Reign of <HI>An∣toninus,</HI> and after them the <HI>East-Saxons</HI> in the Days of King <HI>Athelstan,</HI> from whom the <HI>Danes</HI> having forced it, <HI>Suenus</HI> raged here with Ruine and De∣struction, and scarce had it regained a little Strength and Beauty, when it felt the fury of the <HI>Norman</HI> Conqueror; after this it was besieged by <HI>Hugh Courtney,</HI> Earl of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> in the Civil Wars betwixt the two Houses of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Lanca∣ster</HI>; then by <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> that imaginary, counterfeit, and pretended Prince, who being a young Man of as mean a Family, as Condition, feigning himself to be <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> se∣cond Son of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, made strange Insurrections against <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh: af∣ter this it was pestered by the seditious Rebels of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> about the Year 1549, when although the Citizens were extreamly pinched with a great scarcity of all things, yet they kept the City with Courage and Fidelity, till <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Russel</HI> came to succour and relieve it: And again in the late miserable Confusions it was strictly besieged by the Parliamentarian Forces, at which time it is re∣ported by several Persons of good Credit and Re∣pute, that it being reduced to great extremities for want of Provision, an infite number of Larks came flying into the Town, and setled in a void green place within the Walls, where they were killed in great quantities by the besieged, and eaten.</P>
<P>We departed from hence to <HI>Newton-Bushel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Newton-Bushel.</NOTE> a Town well known in these Parts for its Market, and from thence to <HI>King's-ware,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's-ware.</NOTE> situated below a Hill upon the River <HI>Dart,</HI> and fortified with a Castle for the defence of Vessels, which lie dis∣persed hereabouts, where we ferried over to <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> opposite to it on the other side of the River.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="126"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dart∣mouth.</NOTE><HI>Dartmouth</HI> is situate upon the brow of an high Hill, being divided into three Streets, one rising above the other, to each of which is a gentle ascent gradually by Free-stone Steps contrived and laid there for that purpose: 'Tis enriched with a safe and commodious Haven, and is guarded with a strong Castle which commands the River, being placed aloft just at the very mouth or entrance into it. The great Trade of this Place is fishing to <HI>Newfound-land,</HI> in which there are employed a great many Ships every Year: Their Chief Ma∣gistrate is the Mayor, for which Office there was a Charter granted to the Town by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third; since which it hath been subject to di∣vers Changes and vicissitudes, and hath frequently couragiously held out against the <HI>French,</HI> who have endeavoured to destroy it, but especially in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, for Monsieur <HI>de Castle</HI> having by his Men of War Stopp'd all entercourse of Traffick in those Parts, and burnt <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and being come hither to serve this place after the same manner, met with some shrewd re∣pulses contrary to his expectation, and was by a company of Women, and Country People pre∣vented in his designs, and having all his Men cut off, was himself also slain by the Hands of such Boors, which he always had in the greatest Con∣tempt and derision.</P>
<P>One days visit here having satisfied our curiosity, the next gave us a sight of the renowned Town of <HI>Plimouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plimouth.</NOTE> so called from the River <HI>Plime</HI> that runs along by it: Here is one of the largest and most secure Havens in <HI>England,</HI> for before the ve∣ry mouth of it lies St. <HI>Nicholas Islands,</HI> strongly fortified both by Art, and Nature, and in the Ha∣ven are fortifications laid on both sides for the safe riding of Ships, and anoyance of Enemies: On the one side is Mount <HI>Batton,</HI> in which is a strong Garrison, having twelve Guns mounted upon its platforms, and on the other side the Cittadel,
<PB N="239" REF="126"/>
which may for Strength compare with most Pla∣ces in the Nation, commanding both the Sea and Town at pleasure; Without the Walls of the Cittadel runs a Trench, out of which was dig∣ed a certain kind of Marble, with which they were built, eleven foot thick at the bottom, and seven at the top, and about three quarters of a Mile in compass; upon the Walls are placed di∣vers Watch-Towers, and each of them are ador∣ned with a round Ball upon the top so curiously gilded, and painted with the King's Arms, that they make a glistering shew at a distance, and round about are placed between two, and three hundred pieces of Ordnance: there are two Gates, and as many Draw Bridges which gives entrance into the Castle, and upon the front are admirably carved the Arms of his Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, by which is placed his Royal Statue, with the Arms of the Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> who was then Governor thereof; within the Walls is the Gover∣nor's House, and divers Apartments for Soldiers, a Magazine for Ammunition, and a Store-House for Provisions, and for the Strength and conveni∣encies of this Fortress, which is almost impreg∣nable, the Town was much obliged to the excel∣lent Ingenuity of Sir <HI>Bernard De-Gum,</HI> then his Ma∣jesties Engineer.</P>
<P>The commodiousness of the Harbour often causeth a Fleet of Ships to ride here; so that though this place was formerly but a poor despica∣ble Village, 'tis now so replenished with Mari∣ners, frequented by Merchants, enriched by Traffick, that it seems to outvye some great Cities of this Kingdom, being made a Corporation by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, which consists of a Mayor twelve Aldermen, and twenty-four Common-Council Men, who have a stately <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> for their more solemn Conventions, and is adorned with two handsome Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="127"/>The story of the great Giant <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> who was here worsted by the famous Champion <HI>Cori∣naeus,</HI> and thrown headlong from the <HI>Haw,</HI> a Rock standing between the Town and the Ocean, hath a little too much of the Romance to gain Credit; but the magnificent House near to this Town, called Mount <HI>Edgecomb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mount</HI> Edge∣comb.</NOTE> adds so great a Lustre to these Western Parts, that <HI>Plimouth</HI> hath great rea∣son to be proud of its Vicinity: And, which is still farther observable, it was from this Town that Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> set Sail <HI>A. D.</HI> 1577, when he went that Voyage in which he sailed round the Terrestrial Globe; and it was out of this Haven that the <HI>English</HI> Fleet commanded by the Lord <HI>Howard,</HI> Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> was towed by Ropes <HI>A. D.</HI> 1588. to fight the <HI>Spanish Armada,</HI> unwisely called Invincible.</P>
<P>Being now upon the very Borders of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the unseasonableness of the Weather, which then happened, and the short time allotted for our re∣turn to <HI>Exeter,</HI> not permitting us to take a parti∣cular view of it, we made it our business to inform our selves concerning some of the most remarkable things in this utmost Region of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cornwall.</NOTE><HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Cornish</HI> Men are more active in Wrestling, and such like boisterous Exercises, than any other Shires in <HI>England,</HI> being also more brawny, stout, and able of Body. <HI>Ordulphus,</HI> a <HI>Devonshire</HI> Man, Son of <HI>Ordarus</HI> Earl of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> was such a strong Gigantick Person, that, if <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI> say true, he would break open any Bars of Gates, and stride ten Foot: <HI>John Bray,</HI> a <HI>Cornish</HI> Man, carried on his Back at one time a good way six Bushels of Wheaten Meal, and the Miller, a Lubber of Twenty-four Years of Age, upon the whole: And one <HI>John Roman,</HI> a thick, short Fellow, would carry at one time the whole Carcass of an Ox. There was also one <HI>Kiltor,</HI> who lying in <HI>Lanceston</HI>-Castle Green upon his Back, threw a Stone of some Pounds weight over the top
<PB N="241" REF="127"/>
of one of the highest Towers in that Castle. Which stoutness and goodly stature of this People <HI>Cambden</HI> reflecting on makes this Observation, That the Western People of most Countrys are the tallest and stoutest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cornish</HI> Men are very healthy and long lived, Eighty or Ninety Years of Age is ordinary, as we were told, in every place, and in most Per∣sons accompanied with an able use of the Body and Senses. One <HI>Polzew</HI> lived an 130 Years; a Kinsman of his 112; one <HI>Beaucamp</HI> 106; and one <HI>Brown,</HI> a Beggar, above 100; and in one Pa∣rish in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, there died in Four∣teen Weeks space four People, whose Years added together made 340: And to urge no more Ex∣amples, Mr. <HI>Chamond,</HI> who lived at <HI>Stratton</HI> in this County, was Uncle and Great Uncle to at least 300; the cause of which Healthiness and longevity is in all probability the rockiness and driness of the Country, which though it be for the most part environed with the Sea, yet it hath few Marshes or <HI>Ouzy</HI> Shores, but most Sandy, and withal the Air is cleansed by frequent Winds lying open to the Sea.</P>
<P>The Spring is later in <HI>Cornwall</HI> than in the East Parts of <HI>England,</HI> the Summer temperate, but Harvest late, especially in the middle of the Shire, where they seldom get in their Corn till <HI>Michael∣mas</HI>: The Winter is milder than elsewhere, for the Frost and Snow come very seldom, and ne∣ver stay long when they do come: But this Country is much subject to Storms, lying (as I said) open to the Sea, so that their Hedges are pared, and their Trees Dwarf-grown, and the hard Stones and Iron Bars of Windows are fretted with the Weather; one kind of these Storms they call a Flaw (and so indeed in some Countrys they call any Storm of Wind) which is a mighty Gale of Wind passing suddenly to the Shore with great violence.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="128"/>This Country is Hilly, which is one cause of the temperate Heat of the Summer, and the late∣ness of Harvest, even as its Maritime Situa∣tion is the cause of the gentleness of Winter; Hilly, I say, parted with short and narrow Val∣leys; the Earth is but shallow, underneath which is Rocks and Shelves, so that 'tis hard to be Till∣ed, and apt to be parched by a dry Summer: The middle of the Shire lies open, the Earth be∣ing of a blackish colour, and bears Heath and spiry Grass; there is but little Meadow Ground, but store of Pasture for Cattel and Sheep, and plen∣ty of Corn.</P>
<P>They have a Stone called <HI>Moor-stone,</HI> found upon Moors and wast Ground, which serves them in∣stead of Free-stone for Windows, Doors, and Chimneys, it is white with certain glimmering Sparkles: They have a Stone digged out of the Sea Cliffs of the colour of grey Marble, and ano∣ther Stone black as Jet, and out of the Inland Quarries they dig Free-stone: They have a Slate of three sorts, Blue, Sage-leaf coloured, and Grey, which last is the worst; and all these Slates are commonly found under another kind of Slate that they Wall with, when the depth hath brought the Workmen to the Water: They also make Lime of a kind of Marble-stone, either by burning a great quantity together with Furze, or with Coal in small Kilns, which is the cheaper way, but the first Lime is always the whitest.</P>
<P>For Metals they find Copper here in sundry Places, and the Ore is sometimes shipped off to be refined in <HI>VVales.</HI> And though <HI>Cicero</HI> will have none in <HI>Britain,</HI> yet Silver hath been found in this County in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the First and Third, who reaped good profit by it; nay, Tinners do now and then find little quantities of Gold, and sometimes Silver amongst the Tin Ore; but for the generality, the Metal that the Earth abounds with here is Tin, which they discover by certain
<PB N="243" REF="128"/>
Tin-stones, which are something round and smooth, lying on the Ground, which they call <HI>Shoad.</HI> In their Tin-works amongst the Rubbish they find sometimes Pick-Axes of Holm, Box, and Harts-horns, and sometimes little Tool-heads of Brass; and there was once found a Brass Coin of the Emperor <HI>Domitian</HI>'s in one of the Works, an Argument that the <HI>Romans</HI> wrought in those Tin-Mines in times past. <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> Brother to <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, was the first that began to make Ordinances for these Tin-Works, and afterward <HI>Edmund</HI> his Son granted a Charter and certain Liberties, and prescribed with∣al certain Laws concerning the same, which he ra∣tified and strengthned under his Seal, and imposed a Rent or Tribute upon Tin to be paid unto the Earls; these Liberties, Privileges, and Laws King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third afterward confirmed and augmented.</P>
<P>On <HI>Hengsten-Down,</HI> a little above <HI>Plimouth,</HI> are found <HI>Cornish</HI> Diamonds, wanting nothing but hardness to make them valuable, being of great Beauty, some of them as big as a Nut, and which is most admirable ready shaped and polished by Nature: and in some Places on the Sea Coasts there are Pearls found that breed in Oysters and Muscles, which, though they are great, are yet not very good; here is also sometimes Agat, and white Coral, as they report: It is likewise very famous for those little Fish which they call <HI>Pil∣chars,</HI> swarming in mighty great Shoals about the Shore from <HI>July</HI> to <HI>November,</HI> when being taken and garbaged, and salted and hanged up in smoak, they are in infinite numbers carried over into <HI>France, Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> where they are very welcom Com∣modities, and are called there <HI>Fumados.</HI></P>
<P>Taking our leave of these Parts, and returning by <HI>Ashburton,</HI> a noted Market Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ashburton.</NOTE> we came back to <HI>Exeter,</HI> where passing away the time with some Friends we met with there, till the Assizes
<PB N="244" REF="129"/>
were over, we departed for <HI>Honniton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Honni∣ton.</NOTE> a Town not unknown to such as travel into the West; from whence passing through <HI>Axminster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Axmin∣ster.</NOTE> called by the <HI>Saxons Exan-minster,</HI> from the River <HI>Axi,</HI> which runs by it, a place famous for the Tombs of some <HI>Saxon</HI> Princes, who were slain in the bloody Battel at <HI>Bennaburg,</HI> and translated hither, we came quick∣ly into <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dorset∣shire.</NOTE> a fertile County, well shaded with Woods, enriched with Pasture, and cover∣ed with innumerable Flocks of Sheep, where coasting along by the Sea side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lyme.</NOTE> <HI>Lyme</HI> was the first Place of Note which here appeared to us, to which there is a very troublesom access, by reason of its Situation under a high and steep Rock.</P>
<P>This Town, though it was formerly a poor Receptacle for Fisher-men, is of late Years redu∣ced to a more flourishing Condition; the Houses, which are built of Stone and covered with Slate, stand thick, and in that part which lies near to the Sea, they are sometimes washed ten or twelve Foot high, to the great damage of the lower Rooms. Here is a little kind of Harbour called the <HI>Cobb,</HI> which being sufficiently defended from the Violence of Wind and Weather with Rocks and high Trees which hang over it, doth cause many Vessels to put in hither for shelter. 'Tis a Corporation governed by a Mayor; but of late Years for nothing more famous, than that it was the landing Place of <HI>James</HI> the late Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI> who landing here with a few Forces out of <HI>Holland,</HI> was quickly defeated, and himself brought shortly after to a very Tragical end.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lewes.</NOTE>We proceeded on to <HI>Lewes</HI> which for frequency of People and its goodly Structure, is reputed the principal Town of the County, and there∣fore here generally the Assizes are held for this Countrey, if not at <HI>East-Greenstead,</HI> the remote∣ness of <HI>Chichester</HI> from the City of <HI>London</HI> being probably one reason why they are not kept there: This Town is seated upon a rising almost of eve∣ry side, but that it hath been Walled there are ap∣parent Symptoms. Southward it hath under it a great Suburb called <HI>Southover,</HI> and beyond the Ri∣ver another Eastward called <HI>Cliff,</HI> because 'tis un∣der a chalky Hill, and hath six Parishes well in∣habited.</P>
<P>In the time of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> when King <HI>Athelstan</HI> made a law for Coining of Money, he appoint∣ed two Coiners for this Place. <HI>VVilliam VVarren,</HI> the first Earl of <HI>Surrey,</HI> built a large Castle in the highest ground for the most part with Flint and Chalk, and in the bottom of <HI>Southover,</HI> A. D. 1078. he founded to the Memory of St. <HI>Pancrace</HI>
<PB N="259" REF="136"/>
an Abbey, which he replenished with <HI>Cluniack Monks,</HI> which since the dissolution fell into the possession of the Earls of <HI>Dorset.</HI></P>
<P>But most memorable is this place for a mortal and bloody Battel fought here between King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third and the Barons, in which the prospe∣rous beginning of the Battel on the Kings side was the overthrow of his Forces; for whilst Prince <HI>Edward</HI> his Son, breaking by force through cer∣tain of the Barons Troops, carelesly persued the Enemy over far, as making sure account of the Victory, the Barons having reinforced them∣selves and giving a fresh charge, so discomfited and put to Flight the Kings Army, that they constrain∣ed the King to accept of unequal conditions of peace, and to deliver up his Son with others whom they Demanded into their Hands A. D. 1264. See the Ingenious Mr. <HI>Kennet's Paroch. An∣tiq.</HI> p. 262.</P>
<P>We passed away from thence by <HI>Seaford,</HI> which is in the liberty of the <HI>Cinque-Ports,</HI> a small Fish∣ing Town built of Stone and Slate and defended with a convenient Fort, to <HI>Bourn</HI> a place very Famous for its Wheat-ears, which are a sort of Birds in Summer very palatable and delicious, and so Fat that they dissolve in the Mouth like Jelly: and this lead us through <HI>Pevensey</HI> Marsh, which hath formerly most undoubtedly been overflowed by the Sea, to the Town of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pevensey</HI> called by the <HI>Britains Cair-Pensa∣velcott,</HI> and by others <HI>Penvessel,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Twelve Miles further is <HI>Hastings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hastings.</NOTE> a Sea-Port of good antiquity, consisting of two Parishes, 'tis
<PB N="260" REF="137"/>
situated under very high Hills and Cliffs, is ex∣tended to a good length, and was formerly for∣tified with a strong Castle, the Ruines of which are as yet invisible, but now more conveniently strengthned with two useful Bulwarks, which command the Sea: In the Reign of King <HI>Athel∣stan</HI> here was a Mint-House; afterward it was ac∣counted the first of the Cinque-Ports, which with the Members belonging to it, <HI>viz. Seaford, Peven∣sey, Hodney, Bulver-Hyth, Winchelsea</HI> and <HI>Rye,</HI> which are called the two ancient Towns, were formerly bound to find one and twenty Men of War for the King's Service; thus it flourished long being inhabited by a warlike People, and skilful Sailors; and though the Peer is quite gone to decay, yet here are still an industrious Colony of Fishermen, who very much enrich the Town by their constant Fishery; 'tis governed by a Mayor and Aldermen, who by their prudent mea∣sures very regularly keep up the Grandeur of their Corporation: Here, or at <HI>Pevensey,</HI> was proba∣bly <HI>Anderida</HI> one of the ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Garrisons, as Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> conjectures. <HI>See</HI> Somner's Ro∣man <HI>Ports and Forts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>P.</HI> 104.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Win∣chelsea</HI> by its Name be∣tokens a waterish place seat∣ed in a Corner. I∣dem.

great earthen Walls and Banks, which are preserved and repaired with no small charge and Trouble.</P>
<P>In this Town were formerly three Parish Chur∣ches, dedicated to St. <HI>Leonard,</HI> St. <HI>Gyles,</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> tho' the latter alone, in which are some an∣cient Monuments to be seen, now serves the Town: in that of St. <HI>Leonard</HI> was formerly erected the Picture of St. <HI>Leonard,</HI> the Patron of the place, holding a Fan or <HI>Aeolus</HI> his Scepter in his Hand, which was moveable at the Pleasure of any that would turn it to such a point of the Compass, as best fitted the return of the Husband, or other Friend, whom they expected; and so after that was done, and an Offering made, for without Of∣ferings these Idols would be Idle, they promised to themselves the desired Wind both speedy and pros∣perous: This is likewise a Corporation, but yet a pitiful Spectacle of Poverty and Desertion.</P>
<P>Not many Miles from this Place is <HI>Battel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battel.</NOTE> where <HI>October</HI> 14. A. D. 1066 was fought the Bloody Battel betwixt King <HI>Harold</HI> and the <HI>Norman</HI> Duke, which proved so fatal to the <HI>English</HI> and successful to the <HI>Normans,</HI> for besides King <HI>Harold</HI> himself, who with an Arrow was Shot quite through the Head, there fell with him likewise upon the spot, as we are told by the most accurate Historian Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> who hath wrote the Life of <HI>William</HI> the Conqeror, no less than threescore Thousand Men, upon which he makes this obser∣vation, that nothing seems to show the greatness of <HI>England</HI> so much at this time, as that <HI>Harold</HI> should be able to assemble so mighty an Army to oppose this Invasion: which Ground, where this grand re-en∣counter was, hath been thought ever since to have worn the Conquerour's Livery, because, as they say, after Rain it always looks of a reddish Colour; though afterward this Prince to make some atone∣ment, as he thought, for the vast effusion of Blood which had been Spilt there, the next Year erected a Abby at this place to the Honour of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> and
<PB N="262" REF="138"/>
placed here a Covent of Benedictine Monks, to pray for their Souls who had fallen in the Battel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rye.</NOTE>Three Miles from <HI>Winchelsey</HI> is <HI>Rye,</HI> which stands on the very edge of this County towards <HI>Kent,</HI> and at the very fall of the <HI>Rother</HI> into the Sea. That it was formerly in great vogue, and well fortified by <HI>William Ipres</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent, Ipres</HI> Tow∣er, now the Prison, and the great Immunities and Privileges it had in common with the Cinque-Ports, may sufficiently demonstrate; but by rea∣son of <HI>Winchelsey</HI>'s Vicinity, or the Sea's retiring back, it was of little account till the other Place decayed, and that King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third began by walling it to make it more considerable than it was before; after which, though the Sea did for many Years extreamly befriend it, and a very convenient Haven lay open for Trade and Com∣merce, yet so inconstant is the Favour of that changeable Element, that it is now almost quite choaked up, and a passage hardly left for the smal∣lest sort of Vessels, and were it not for its Fishery, and the conveniency from hence of a ready Pas∣sage into <HI>Normandy,</HI> it is to be feared it would fall quickly under the same deplorable fate of its Neighbour, if some other Privileges from the Cor∣poration do not support and keep it up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kent.</NOTE>We Ferried over the <HI>Camber</HI> from <HI>Rye</HI> into <HI>Kent,</HI> which is divided into three several Por∣tions: the first is a Ridge of Hills that runs by <HI>Box∣ley, Detling, &amp;c.</HI> and is call'd <HI>Health without Wealth</HI>; the second is that which runs by <HI>Sutton, Boughton, Malherf, &amp;c.</HI> and is called <HI>Health and Wealth</HI>; the third by <HI>Tenterden,</HI> and is called <HI>Wealth without Health</HI>; Names very proper for them, and the reason is very plain why they are so, Nature ha∣ving so liberally apportioned her Blessings, that she compensates the defect of one by the colla∣tion of another, not suffering any peculiar Place to Monopolize all her Favours at once; but thus, if the <HI>VVeald</HI> be eminent for Wool, the Fame of
<PB N="263" REF="138"/>
East <HI>Kent</HI> shall be as great for Corn, and <HI>Tenham, Goddington,</HI> and <HI>Otham</HI> shall be no less cried up for Orchards; if <HI>Shepey</HI> or <HI>Reculver</HI> produce the best Wheat, <HI>Thanet</HI> shall bring forth as good crops of Barley; and if <HI>Cranbrook</HI> hath the Name for Beer, <HI>Tunbridge</HI> shall for Water. In fine, if either the fertility of the Soil, or the safe Roads and sure Harbours for Ships, or the broad Streams of a great navigable River, the noble River <HI>Thames,</HI> or the Vicinity of the vast and opulent City of <HI>London,</HI> can be any way contributive to advance its Prosperity, it must needs be one of the richest and most flourishing Provinces of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>As this Country was first subdued by the <HI>Romans</HI> under <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> not without great resistance, so was it by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who erected their first King∣dom here, and were the first of that Nation who embraced the Christian Faith; but the learned and judicious Antiquary Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> will by no means allow of the common Story that goes so vul∣garly amongst us, how the Commons of <HI>Kent</HI> con∣tinue their Privileges by means of a Composition entred with <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror at <HI>Swanscomb</HI>; No, under favour, saith he in his <HI>Treatise of Ga∣velkind, p.</HI> 62. we owe them not to that, or any such like specious Stratagem, or are beholding either to <HI>Stigand</HI> the Arch-Bishop, or <HI>Egelsines</HI> the Abbot's Policy to contrive, or to their, or our Country-mens Valour to compass their continu∣ance for us in such a way: But this Story was rai∣sed by <HI>Spot,</HI> St. <HI>Austin</HI>'s Chronicler at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> living under <HI>Edward</HI> the First, and only by him and such others as of later Times wrote after his Copy; for before him, and in that interim of more than 200 Years between the Conquest and the time he wrote, no published Story, no Chro∣nicle, no Record of any time, <HI>Kentish</HI> or other, may be found to warrant the Relation, a matter so remarkable, that if true, it was not likely to escape all our Historians Pens that were before
<PB N="264" REF="139"/>
him, especially about the Conquest. Nay, he adds farther from <HI>Gulielmus Pictaviensis,</HI> who was the Conqueror's own Chaplain, and wrote his Life, that the Conqueror, after his Victory near <HI>Hastings,</HI> made not first to <HI>London</HI> and then to <HI>Kent,</HI> but after setling his Affairs about <HI>Hastings,</HI> presently took his Journey towards <HI>Dover</HI> by the way of <HI>Romney,</HI> where having avenged himself of the savage kind of Inhabitants, for the slaughter of certain of his Men by some mistake landing at that Place, he thence advanced on to <HI>Dover,</HI> whi∣ther, though a numberless multitude of People had betaken themselves as to a Place by reason of the Castle inexpugnable, yet dismayed with the Con∣queror's approach, the Place with all readiness submitted to him, who after eight Days Fortifica∣tion of it marching from thence, at a Place not far from <HI>Dover</HI> the <HI>Kentish</HI> Men of their own ac∣cord came in unto him, sware Fealty to him, and gave him Hostages for performance. In fine, he calls it a mere Monkish Figment politickly devised (saith he) by a Monk, with a design to bring a perpetual Obligation on the <HI>Kentish</HI> Men to his own Abbey, as owing forsooth the continuance of their ancient Li∣berties partly to a <HI>quondam</HI> Abbot of that Place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kentish</HI> Men have a peculiar Exercise, es∣pecially in the Eastern Parts, which is no where else used in any other Country I believe but their own, 'tis called <HI>Stroke-Biass,</HI> and the manner of it is thus; In the Summer time one or two Parishes convening make choice of twenty, and sometimes more, of the best Runners which they can cull out in their Precincts, who send a Challenge to an equal number of Racers within the Liberties of two other Parishes to meet them at a set day upon some neighbouring Plain, which Challenge, if ac∣cepted, they repair to the Place appointed, whither also the Country resort in great numbers to behold the Match, where, having stripped themselves at the Goal to their Shirts and Drawers, they begin
<PB N="265" REF="139"/>
the Course, every one having in his Eye a parti∣cular Man at which he aims, but after several tra∣verses and courses on both sides, that side whose Legs are the nimblest to gain the first seven strokes from their Antagonists, carry the Day and win the Prize: Nor is this Game only appropriated to the Men, but in some Places the Maids have their set Matches too, and are as vigorous and active to obtain a Victory: And on a Plain near <HI>Chilham</HI> there is an annual Tie, as they call it, fixed in <HI>May</HI> for two young Men and two young Maids of the adjoining Hundreds to make a Trial of Skill, which can course the nimblest for a certain <HI>Stadium</HI> of 40 Rods, and the Person of both Sexes, whose Heels are the nimblest, is rewarded with Ten Pound each, there being a Yearly Pension setled for that Diversion.</P>
<P>As touching the more considerable Customs and Privileges of <HI>Kent,</HI> they have been so fully Dis∣coursed of by Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> in his Perambulation of <HI>Kent,</HI> and what was deficient in him supplied by the most accurate Pen of Mr. <HI>Kilburn</HI> and Mr. <HI>Philpott,</HI> that I shall wave them all as heterogene∣ous from my design, and betake my self rather to a short Survey of such Places which we visited in our Journey.</P>

unto <HI>Appledore</HI>) there cast Anchor, and de∣stroying a Fort or Castle, as old and imperfect as ill defended, built a new one, and kept their Ren∣dezvouz there.</P>
<P>In the Church (which is a fair Sea Mark for Mariners) is an old Inscription upon a Tomb∣stone, which speaks thus; <HI>Of your Charity pray for the Soul of</HI> Thomas Briggs, <HI>who died on the Feast of St.</HI> Leonard <HI>the Confessor, who died in the Year of our Lord</HI> 1442. <HI>and did make the Roof of this Church as far as</HI> 45 <HI>Copplings goeth, which doth cost</HI> 54 <HI>Marks.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Denge∣ness.</NOTE>From this Town runs a Promontory near two or three Miles into the Sea, at the end of which stands a Light House to give direction to Sailors in dark and stormy Nights, and near to that upon the Beach is a Well of excellent fresh Water, and in the utmost point of it, which is called <HI>Denge∣ness,</HI> for a Mile together did grow abundance of Holm-Trees amongst the Beach and Pebbles; near to which are to be seen an heap of greater Stones, which the Inhabitants call St. <HI>Crispin</HI> and <HI>Crispianus,</HI> whom they report to have been cast upon this Shore by Shipwrack, and from hence called into the glorious Company of Saints.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Old</HI> Rom∣ney.</NOTE>Two Miles farther in the Marsh stands <HI>Old Romney,</HI> which gives a denomination to the whole Marsh circumambient, where I shall only take notice from Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> in his <HI>Roman</HI> Ports, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that as this Port in Doomsday Book was formerly called <HI>Lamport,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lamport.</NOTE> and the Hundred wherein it lay the Hundred of <HI>Lamport,</HI> so the Eldest mention, that he found in <HI>Romney</HI> was in a Grant or Char∣ter of <HI>Plegmund</HI> the Arch-Bishop, A.

<P>In this Town are generally held all Publick Assemblies for the more speedy dispatch of the Cinque-Port Affairs, and are called the Brother∣hood and Guestling: Now a Brotherhood is an Assembly held by the Mayors, Bayliffs, Jurats, and Commons of the Cinque-Ports, and their Corporate Members jointly.</P>

<P>But though <HI>Hyth</HI> extracted all its Glory from those Places, yet so subject are Towns and Cities to Vicissitudes as well as Men, that it seems to be involved in the same Fate, and to decline into their perishing Condition, having of late Years suffer∣ed a great Eclipse of all its pristine Splendor, and every day more and more very sensibly decaying by the loss of its Haven, and the distance of the Sea, which hath almost withdrawn it self near a Mile from the Town.</P>
<P>The Town is situated upon the brow of an high stony craggy Hill, the lower part consisting of one long Street, which extends it self about half a
<PB N="270" REF="142"/>
Mile in length, and in the upper part are placed some few rows of Houses, together with the Church, an ancient Fabrick, which overlooks all the other Buildings, and discovers it self at a great distance at Sea, capacious enough to receive a greater Con∣gregation than with which it is usually frequented: But that which now more especially preserves still the Fame, and keeps up the repute of this poor languishing Port besides the two Hospitals of St. <HI>John</HI> and St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> the latter of which was Founded by <HI>Haymo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> who was Born here, is the Charnel-House adjoining to the Church, or the arched Vault under it, wherein are orderly piled up a great stack of dead Mens Bones and Skulls, which appear very white and solid, but how or by what means they were brought to this Place the Townsmen are altogether ig∣norant, and can give no account of the matter; probably the first occasion of them might be from what is related by <HI>Henry Knyghton, de Even∣tibus Angliae,</HI> lib. 3. p. 2503. How that in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, about the Year 1295, the then King of <HI>France</HI> sending about 300 Ships for an <HI>English</HI> Invasion, one of them more for∣ward than the rest came directly for <HI>Hyth,</HI> where landing their Men, the <HI>English</HI> who were there placed for the defence of that Port killed at that time 240 Men, all that whole Ships Crew, and afterward burnt the Ship out of which they land∣ed: Now after this slaughter these Mens Bones in all probability might be gather'd up and laid there, after which daily accessions of more might be made till they encreased to so vast a number as is still visible.</P>

<P>The Castle is within the Parish of <HI>Folkstone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Folkstone.</NOTE> a Town situated upon the brow of a Hill, about a Mile distant from it: 'Tis a Place of greater An∣tiquity than Beauty, especially if it be allowed, what is but reasonably suggested by that most Ce∣lebrated Antiquary Mr. <HI>Somner,</HI> and confirm'd by the most Judicious Bishop <HI>Stilling fleet,</HI> that this was the <HI>Lapis tituli</HI> of <HI>Nennius,</HI> or rather <HI>Lapis popu∣li,</HI> where <HI>Vortimer</HI> desired to be Buried (<HI>Scipio</HI> like) as a terrour to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> because of its lofty situ∣ation, and not as he would have it <HI>Stonar</HI> in <HI>Thanet,</HI> which lying in a low flat level, subject to Inundations, was a very improper place for such a daring project: it was formerly of a far great∣er extent than it now is, for there were then in it five Churches, four of which were long since by the assaults of the Enemies, and devastations of Men utterly dismantled, besides a Nunnery found∣ed by King <HI>Eadbald</HI> about A. D. 630. which was Destroyed during the Danish Wars: only that Church, which was erected by <HI>Nigellus de Munewell</HI> and devouted to St. <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Eanswith,</HI> hath been as yet too hard a morsel for the Teeth of time to consume.</P>
<P>That there was formerly an Harbour adjoyning to the Town made chiefly at the great charge of the Honourable Sir <HI>Basil Dixwel</HI> Baronet, the rui∣nous Skeleton of the demolished Peer, which is as yet visible, may be sufficient to evince; but though the Haven be quite lost, the Fishery is
<PB N="274" REF="144"/>
still kept up by a considerable Colony of Industri∣ous Fishermen, who take great quantities of Fish, which is every Week bought up and conveyed a∣way to <HI>London</HI> by the Rippers, as they are called, or taken in by Smacks which come hither for such lading, the quickness of which Trade makes the Town mightily encrease and grow more and more Populous as well as Rich by their Industry.</P>
<P>But before I leave this place I cannot but take notice that as that great Man of his time, <HI>John Salmon,</HI> Prior of <HI>Ely,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and Lord Chancellour of <HI>England,</HI> who being sent Embassadour by <HI>Edward</HI> the Second into <HI>France,</HI> at his return into <HI>England,</HI> sickned and dyed here <HI>Ju∣ly</HI> the 6th A.

<P>Near this Town upon the Cliffs we met with some Stones of diverse Shapes and Figures very strange and wonderful, some resemble a Muscle, but are a great deal bigger than they, others were like a Kernel of an Almond large and somwhat roundish, which are Streaked and crankled like a Cockle-shell, but of a more dusky colour; others we found somewhat bigger than a Hazlenut, and some much less, which are like a Cockle too but are as smooth and as black as Jet; some we disco∣vered
<PB N="275" REF="144"/>
which were wreath'd and intorted like Screws of smaller and larger dimensions, others which resemble Cock-spurs being sharp at the end and in every respect shaped like unto them, but as smooth and of the same colour with our ordi∣nary Flint-stone, others which are form'd like Quills cleer as Amber; some we observed whose lower parts seem to be effigiated into diverse little Feet, bearing a resemblance to those that are visible in some little creeping insects, others altogether resemble Snakes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter">See Mr <HI>John Ray</HI> Fellow of the Royal Society concerning Serpent Stones, and Petrified Shells.

Now tho' the solidity of all these Stones, without any Cavity which is visible amongst them, may be sufficient to convince any Man, that they are by no means pe∣trifications, but natural, and such as they were al∣ways from the Creation, though how they came to put on such strange and uncommon Figures is a secret not to be unravelled, yet certain∣ly since there are diverse real and natural Shells of Fishes too, which are to be found upon these Cliffs, as likewise have been gathered upon Mountains, particularly in <HI>Richmondshire</HI> before mentioned, far enough remote from the Sea, of diverse magni∣tudes, shapes, and colours, sure in all probabili∣ty the latter must needs have been left there upon the ebb of the Deluge, since otherwise there can hardly be any other satisfactory account given, how such Shells should happen to be carried to such Mountainous places.</P>
<P>From <HI>Folk-stone,</HI> for five or six Miles together, is a continued Chain of chalky Hills standing in a row hanging jointly one to another, about the middle whereof is a Catarackt of Water, which coming a great way, as is supposed, under Ground,

and falling down from the Cliffs speeds away to Sea going usually by the name of <HI>Lyddals Spout</HI>; and along these Cliffs grow abundance of that ex∣cellent sallad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lydal Spout.</NOTE> which they call Samphire.</P>
<P>These Cliffs, I say, continue without the least interruption till they are parted by <HI>Dover,</HI> which is seated betwixt two high Cliffs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dover.</NOTE> lying opposite to each other, on the one whereof stands the Castle, a place formerly of that strength and importance, that it is Styled by Antiquaries the Key and Lock, the Bar and Spar of <HI>England,</HI> and was ever repu∣ted so mightily conducive to the facilitating the Conquest of this Nation by getting it into Pos∣session, that <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> told his Son <HI>Lewis,</HI> that notwithstanding he had obtained many signal Victories in this Island, and won several Forts and strong holds therein, yet he had not one Foot in <HI>England,</HI> till he was Master of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle: Which though some are of Opinion, was founded by <HI>Arviragus</HI> a King of the <HI>Britains,</HI> yet Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> is very possitive against those, who would have it built by <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> whose abode in <HI>Britain</HI> was too short for so vast an undertaking; however whether the ancient Church belonging to this Castle was built by <HI>Lucius</HI> our first Christian King or not, Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> is again pretty well assu∣red that as here was formerly placed a <HI>Roman</HI> Gar∣rison, so the Square Tower in the middle between the Body and the Chancel, fitted with holes on all parts for speculation, was formerly a <HI>Roman Specula,</HI> or Watch-Tower, and he farther observes out of <HI>Tuine,</HI> that that which at this Day they call the <HI>Devils Drop,</HI> being a mouldring ruinous heap of Masonrey on the opposite Hill on the other side of the Town, was the remains of a <HI>Roman Pharos,</HI> or Structure of theirs, intended for the placing of Night lights to secure their Passage (otherwise very perillous) who should put into this Port by Night.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="145"/>On this Hill, in a Tenterected for that purpose, was that Noble Ceremony performed of Inaugura∣ting the Right Honourable <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Romney,</HI> into that great and Weighty Office of Constable of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque-Ports <HI>June</HI> 1. 1694, being there waited upon by the Barons, Mayors, Baliffs, and Jurats of the Cinque-Ports, two ancient Towns, and their Members, with diverse other Persons of great Quality, who attended that Solemnity.</P>
<P>Below the Castle is placed a strong Fort, and on the other Cliff opposite to it is erected another, both which Block-Houses are for the defence of the Haven or Peer, which of late Years hath been almost choaked and quite Stopped up by a huge quantity of Beach thrown into it by the Sea; however by reason of a ready and speedy passage to <HI>Callice</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> to which some will fain have <HI>England</HI> to have been formerly united by an <HI>Isthmus,</HI> there is daily in times of peace a great concourse of Foreigners who frequent it.</P>
<P>The Town being one of the Cinque-Ports, of which <HI>Folk-stone</HI> is a Limb, and governed by a Mayor and Jurats is of a good large extent, being above a Mile in length from <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Artclff Fort.</NOTE> <HI>Artcliff Fort</HI> to the farther end of <HI>Bigginstreet,</HI> but 'tis nothing so Po∣pulous, nor so well Inhabited as formerly: 'tis a∣dorned with two Churches and a commodious Market place, which is well replenished every Saturday with all necessary Provision, of which there is brought great supplies constantly out of the Country, and for the Victualling the Kings Ships, there is a large Store-House, from whence Provi∣sions are conveyed to the Navy: But I must not omit farther to observe that in this Town was for∣merly a House belonging to that ancient order of the Knights Templars, wherein was Sealed the submission, which King <HI>John</HI> made to <HI>Pandulphus</HI> the Popes Legate, wherein he yielded his Realm Tributary, and himself an obedientiary and vassal to the Bishop of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="146"/>The Cliffs beyond <HI>Dover</HI> being united are well stored with Samphire and reach almost as far as <HI>Walmer</HI> and <HI>Deal Castles</HI> which together with <HI>San∣down Castle</HI> were built by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walmer Deal and Sandown Castle.</NOTE> near to which upon a flat or even plain lying full against the Sea stands <HI>Deal,</HI> which of a small and poor Village is now become a place of great note and eminency: hereabouts it was where <HI>Julius Ce∣sar</HI> Landed, and though Mr. <HI>Somner,</HI> would have <HI>Dover</HI> to be the place, where he first attempted to arrive, yet saith the Accurate Mr. <HI>Kennet</HI> in his Life of Mr. <HI>Somner,</HI> it is otherwise Demonstrated from Astronomical computation by the very Inge∣nious Mr. <HI>E.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deal.</NOTE>The Town is called lower <HI>Deal</HI> to distinguish it from the upper part, which being the more anci∣ent lies about a Mile farther distant from the Sea, and that which hath been the sole cause of raising it, was the commodious Riding for Ships in the <HI>Downs,</HI> where Merchant Men making a stop both outward and homeward Bound, and taking in here many times a great part of their Provision have by degrees enstated it in a very prosperous condi∣tion: and indeed its buildings have of late Years been so considerably enlarged and its Trade pro∣moted by great Fleets of Ships, who here take in Pilots to carry them up the River Thames, that it hath almost quite eclipsed the splendour of <HI>Sand∣wich,</HI> which is three or four Miles distance from it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sand∣wich.</NOTE><HI>Sandwich,</HI> being another of the Cinque Ports, is on the North and West side fortified with Walls, and on the other side fenced with a Rampire, Bulwark and Ditch; it was called formerly <HI>Lun∣denwick,</HI> either from its being very populous, which the British word <HI>Lawn</HI> imports, or by rea∣son of the great Trade to and from <HI>London,</HI> or from some more peculiar interest the <HI>Londoners</HI> had

in this Place above all other Ports, but the name of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> saith Mr. <HI>Somner,</HI> occurs not in any coetaneous Writer or Writing, until the Year 979, when King <HI>Egelred</HI> granted it by that Name to the Monks of <HI>Canterbury</HI> for their Cloathing, which <HI>Canutus</HI> after his arrival restored again to the same Monks for their sustenance in Victuals, with the Addition of his Golden Crown and (what perhaps was of equal value in the estima∣tion of those Times) St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s Arm: It is supposed to have been the Daughter of <HI>Rutapis</HI> or <HI>Richborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Richbo∣rough.</NOTE> which was an eminent Fortress of the <HI>Romans</HI> hard by, and the first Presidentiary Station that Antiquity represents them to have erected within <HI>Britain</HI>; but like the Mother 'tis now very much gone to decay, for besides what it suffered from the <HI>French</HI> in the Reigns of King <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, after it was recovered again from its Sufferings, the Haven being choaked up by the Sand, and a great Ship belonging to Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the Fourth, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> sinking down at the very entrance into the <HI>Haven,</HI> hath ever since reduced it to so great Extremities, that the mischief, it is to be feared, now will prove utterly incurable; however, it is yet beautified with three Churches, and a Free School which was Built and Endowed by Sir <HI>Roger Manwood,</HI> Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer; and what at present chiefly makes for the Town is the <HI>Dutch</HI> Colony which is here setled.</P>
<P>Not far from hence lie those dangerous Sands so much dreaded by Sailors, called <HI>Goodwyn Sands,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goodwyn Sands.</NOTE> which though it is the common Opinion that they were Lands of the Earl of <HI>Goodwyn,</HI> swallowed up by the Sea about <HI>A.

<P>Over against <HI>Sandwich,</HI> on the other side of the River <HI>Stour,</HI> is <HI>Thanet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isle of <HI>Thanet.</HI></NOTE> a small but very fertile Island, where the chiefest Scenes both of War and Peace have been formerly laid, for as Mr. <HI>Phil∣pott</HI> observes, when <HI>Hengist</HI> arrived with his <HI>Saxons</HI> to support the harassed and afflicted <HI>Britains</HI> a∣gainst the Eruption of the <HI>Picts,</HI> he first landed in this Island, and when his Forces were broke by <HI>Vortimer</HI> at the Battel of <HI>Alresford,</HI> he made <HI>Thanet</HI> his retreat and shelter; when <HI>Austen</HI> the Monk arrived in <HI>England</HI> to disseminate the Chri∣stian Religion amongst the <HI>Saxons,</HI> he found his first Reception in this Island.

but so great and dismal Calamities did frequently attend it, that the Fury of the Elements seemed to enter into a Corrivalship or Competition with the Fury of Enemies for its Ruine, and the Fire and Sword were joint Confederates to destroy it; ne∣vertheless, maugre all these Casualties, by the Fa∣vour of Princes, and their Royal Munificence, it recovered all its Losses, and survives in Splendor. In the Year 1225, by the indulgent Bounty of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third it was invested with a Wall, and that this Fortification might be of the greater importance, it was secured or fenced with a Ditch; it was governed by a Port-Reeve until King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, in the second Year of his Reign, raised it to a higher Dignity, and decreed by his Royal Grant, that it should henceforth be under the Jurisdiction of a Mayor and Twelve Al∣dermen, and to this Monarch doth the City owe much of its present Felicity.</P>

maintained it, and that likewise from the Impressi∣ons of his Fury; since which time there hath been little of moment acted in this Place; tho it is worth taking notice of what Mr. <HI>Philpott</HI> hath observed farther concerning it, that there being much Land in this County held thereof, whose Tenure is per∣fectly Castle-guard, upon the day prefixed for the discharging the quit Rents relating to it, there is a Banner displayed and hung out (antiently it was on the Castle Wall) and all those who are Tenants to this Mannor, and are in default by their Non∣appearance, and do not discharge their accustoma∣ry Duties and Services, the penalty imposed upon their neglect is, that the return of every Tide of the adjacent River <HI>Medway,</HI> which finds them ab∣sent, doubles their Service or Quit-Rents.</P>
<P>The Cathedral, which the Bishoprick of <HI>Roche∣ster</HI> united to it, was founded and established by that pious Monarch <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of Kent, and the first Bishop to whom was entrusted the Pastoral Staff or Crosier by <HI>Austen</HI> the Apostle of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> was <HI>Justus,</HI> who being sent over hither as an Adju∣tant to <HI>Austen</HI> in the Propagation of Christianity, about the Year 601,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Angl. Sacr. Tom. 1. <HI>p.</HI> 329.</NOTE> was afterward ordained Bi∣shop of this See <HI>A. D.</HI> 604. much about that time that <HI>Mellitus</HI> was consecrated Bishop of <HI>London</HI>: The above-mentioned Prince not only assenting to his Consecration by his Presence, but likewise largely contributing to the support of the Person chosen and his Successors, by enriching them with great Possessions. This Cathedral was dedicated by <HI>Ethelbert</HI> to St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> as that which he built likewise at <HI>London</HI> was to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> but whatever the Piety of that Prince, and other Religious Per∣sons after him, did in former Ages contribute to its enlargement and beautifying, the late prevail∣ing Faction of some injurious Incendiaries, did in a few Months dispoil and almost abolish; and the Scars, which still remain in its Sacred Body, are too pregnant Symptoms to convince the World

what usage it received from those Sacrilegious <HI>Bou∣tefeus,</HI> whose great Triumphs would have been over its Ruins, and chiefest Glory to have laid its Honour in the Dust, had not he, who sets bounds to the tempestuous Ocean, limited their Fury, and rescued it from their Malice.</P>
<P>From <HI>Rochester</HI> the curious Stone-Bridge built over the River <HI>Medway</HI> by Sir <HI>Robert Knolles</HI> (which is one of the largest Bridges in <HI>England,</HI> being fix∣ed upon 21 Arches, and coped above with Iron Bars by Arch-Bishop <HI>Warham</HI>) leads us to <HI>Stroud,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stroud.</NOTE> a Place where the Knights Templars had former∣ly an eminent Mansion, and the Chappel of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> was improved to a Mother Church, and endowed, being divided by too great a distance from the Church of <HI>Frendsbury,</HI> to which it had been annexed, and which was supposed uncapable for so great a conflux of People, as began every day to multiply within the Liberties of <HI>Stroud.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Medway.</NOTE>The River <HI>Medway</HI> is carried into the Aestuary of <HI>Thames</HI> by two Mouths, the one whereof West∣ward, is called <HI>West-Swale,</HI> as the Eastern one which seems to have cut the Isle of <HI>Shepey</HI> from the Continent, <HI>East-Swale</HI>; but by <HI>Bede, Genlad</HI> and <HI>Yenlett:</HI> Now it is rather probable, that this was the <HI>Swalve</HI> mentioned by <HI>Birchington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 216.</NOTE> wherein <HI>Austen</HI> the Monk baptized Ten thousand Men, and not the <HI>Swale</HI> in <HI>Richmondshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 163.</NOTE> that being the River where <HI>Paulinus</HI> his great Friend and Coad∣jutor baptized the like number.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Island of Shepey.</NOTE>And now having made mention of the <HI>Isle of Shepey,</HI> I cannot but observe, that it was formerly very famous for two Religious Princesses, <HI>Sexbur∣ga</HI> and <HI>Hermenilda; Sexburga</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Anna</HI> the Seventh King of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> and his Wife <HI>Hereswyda,</HI> Sister to the Holy Abbess St. <HI>Hylda,</HI> was married to <HI>Erconbertus</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the Fifth Year of her Father's Reign; by whom she had two Sons, <HI>Egbert</HI> and <HI>Lotharius,</HI> and two Daugh∣ters <HI>Ermenilda</HI> and <HI>Erkengota: Sexburga,</HI> after her

Husband's Death, governed the Kingdom of <HI>Kent</HI> twenty-four Years, until her Son <HI>Egbert</HI> was grown up to be fit to undertake the Government, which having once committed to him, she laid aside her Royal Robes, and betaking her self to this Island, built here a Nunnery, <HI>A. D.</HI> 710. and endowed it liberally for Seventy-seven Nuns: Afterwards com∣mitting it to the care of her Daughter <HI>Ermenilda,</HI> she went into the Isle of <HI>Ely</HI> to her Sister <HI>Ethelreda,</HI> where after her Death she was Abbess of the same Nunnery, all this while living a very severe morti∣fied Life, and giving up her self wholly to Prayer and Devotion: Afterward the Nunnery being burnt by the <HI>Danes,</HI> it was re-ediffed by <HI>William</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> A. D. 1130. to the Honour of St. <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Sexburg.</HI></P>
<P>But on the 21th of <HI>September</HI> the Festival of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> our Journey began to draw near to an end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Graves∣end.</NOTE> for our last Stage being by <HI>Gravesend</HI> (a Town notorious as well for its Block-Houses opposite to each other, as the great conveniency of a Passage in Wherries every Tide up and down the River <HI>Thames</HI>) to <HI>Dartford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dartford.</NOTE> a Market Town of no small account for all sort of Grain, by reason of its Vicinity to the Grand <HI>Emporium</HI> of this Nation, we depart∣ed from thence to the City, and arrived again at <HI>London</HI> in great Health and Safety, after some months Circuit about the Maritime Coasts of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
