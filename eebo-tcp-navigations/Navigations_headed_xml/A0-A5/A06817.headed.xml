<HEAD><HI>The Preface.</HI> Heere beginneth a little treatise or booke named <HI>Iohn Maundeuile</HI> Knight, borne in England in the Towne of S. <HI>Albone,</HI> and speaketh of the wayes to Hierusalem, to Inde, and to the great Caane, and also to <HI>Prestor Iohns</HI> land, and to many other countries, and also of many meruailes that are in the holy land.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Orasmuch as the land ouer the Sea, that is to say, the holie land, that some call the land of Bihest, among all other lands is most worthie and soueraigne, for it is blessed, hallowed and sacred of the precious bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, in the which land it liked him to take flesh and bloud of the Virgin Marie, and to enuiron that land with his owne feete, and there he would do many mira∣cles, preach and teach the faith and the law of chri∣stian men, as vnto his children, and there he would suffer manie reproues and scornes for vs, and hee that was king of heauen and hell, of earth, of aire, of sea, and land, and of all things that are contained in them, would alonely be called king of that land, when hee said, <HI>Rex sum Iudaeorum,</HI> I am King of the Iewes: For at that time it was the land of Iewes, and that land he chose before all other lands, as the best and most worthie of vertues of all the world. And as the Philosopher saith: <HI>Virtus rerum in medio consistit,</HI> that is to say, the vertue of things is in the midst: and in that land hee would lead his life, and
<PB REF="3"/> suffer passion and death of the Iewes for vs, to saue and deliuer vs from the paines of hell, and from death without end, the which was ordained to vs for the sinne of our father <HI>Adam,</HI> and our owne sins also: for as for himselfe he had none euill done nor deserued, for he neuer thought ne did any euill, for he that was king of glory and of ioy might best in that place suffer death. For hee that will doe any thing that he will haue knowne openly, he will pro∣claime it openly, in the middle place of a towne or of a Citie, so that it may be knowne to all par∣ties of the citie. So he that was king of glorie and of all the world would suffer death for vs at Hieru∣salem, which is the midst of the world, so that it might be knowne to all nations of the world, how deare he bought man, that hee made him with his hands to his owne likenesse, for the great loue that he had to vs: Ah deare God, what loue hee had to his subiects, when hee that had done no trespasse would for his trespassours suffer death: for a more worthie cattel he might not haue set for vs, then his owne blessed body, and his owne precious bloud the which he suffered for vs, right well ought men to loue, worship, dread and serue such a Lord, &amp; praise such an holy land that brought forth a Lord of such fruite, through the which each man is saued, but if it be his owne default. This is that land prepared for an heritage to vs, and in that land would he die as seased, to leaue it to his children. For the which each good christian man that may and hath where∣with, should strength him for to conquere our right heritage &amp; purchase, out of the euill peoples hands,
<PB REF="3"/> for we are cleped christian men of Christ our father, and if we be the right children of Christ we ought to challenge the heritage that our father left vs, &amp; take it out of strange mens hands. But now Pride, Couetise, and Enuie, hath so inflamed the hearts of the Lords of the world, that they are more busie to disherite their neighbours, then to challenge or con∣quere their right heritage aforesaid. And the com∣mon people that would put their bodies and their cattell for to conquere our heritage, they may not do it without lords: for assembling of the people with∣out a chiefe Lord, is as a flock of sheepe without a shepheard, the which depart asunder, and wot not whither they shall go. But would God the worldly Lords were at a good accord, &amp; with other of their common people, would take this holy voyage ouer the sea, I trust well that within a little time our right heritage before said, should be reconciled and put into the hands of the right heirs of Iesu Christ.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as it is long time that there was any generall passage ouer the sea, &amp; that many men desire to heare speaking of the holy land, and haue thereof great solace and comfort.</P>
<P>Wherefore yee shall heare by me <HI>Iohn Maunde∣uile</HI> Knight, which was borne in England, in the towne of Saint Albones, and passed the sea in the yeare of our Lord Iesu Christ, a thousand iii. C. on the day of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> and there remained long time, and went through many lands, &amp; many pro∣uinces, kingdomes &amp; Iles, and haue passed through Turky, and through Armony, the little &amp; the great, through Tartary, Persia, Surry, Araby, Egypt
<PB REF="4"/> the high and the low, through Libia, Chalde, and a great part of Ethiope, through Amazony, through Inde the lesse &amp; the more, a great part, and through many other Iles which are about Inde, where ma∣ny people dwelleth of diuers lawes and shapes. Of the men of which lands &amp; Iles I shall speake more plainly: and I shall declare part of the things what they are when time shall be, after it may best come to my minde, and specially for them that will and are in purpose for to visite the holy citie of Hierusa∣lem, and the holy places that are thereabout, and I shall tell the way that they shall hold thether; for I haue many times passed and ridden it with good company, and with many Lords.</P>

<HEAD>Hee that will goe toward Hierusalem on horse, on foote, or by sea. Chap. j.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the name of God Almightie Hée that will tra∣uaile to <HI>Hierusalem</HI> may goe many waies, both by sea and by land, after the country that he commeth from: but thincke not I will tell all the Townes, Cities and castels that men shall go by, for then should I make too long a tale, but onely the most principall countries, cities and townes that men shall go by and through, to go the right way.</P>
<P>First, if a man come from the West side of the world, as England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and Norway, he may if hée will goe through Almaine and throughout the kingdome of Hungary, which King is a great lord and a mightie, and hold∣eth many lands and great, for he holdeth the land of Hungary, Sauoy, Camony, a great part of Bulgary, that men call the land of Bugres, and a great part of the kingdome of Russie, and that lasteth to the land of Milland, and marcheth on Ci∣prus, and men passe thus through the land of Hungary, and through the Citie that men call Cipanum, and through the ca∣stle of Nurburgh, &amp; by the Ile Torne, toward the end of Hun∣gary, and so by the riuer of Danubie, that is a full great riuer and goeth into Almaine, vnder the hils of Lumbardy, &amp; it ta∣keth into it fortie other riuers, and it runneth throughout Hungary, and through Cresses and Crochie, and goeth into the sea, so strongly and with so great might that the water is fresh thirty miles within the sea, &amp; afterward men goe to Belgraue and entreth into the land of Bugres, and there men passe a bridge of stone that is ouer the riuer of Morack, &amp; so men passe through the land of Pinseras and come to Gréece to the citie of Stermisse, and to the citie of Affinpane, that was sometime called Bradre the noble, and so the citie of Constantinople that was sometime called Bessalneron, and there dwelled common∣ly the Emperour of Gréece.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>At Constantinople is the best and the fayrest Church of the world, and it is of Saint <HI>Steuen.</HI> And before this Church is a guilt Image of <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperour and it is sitting vpon a horse and crowned, and it was wont to holde a round apple in his hand, and men say there, that it is a token that the Em∣perour hath lost a part of his lands, for the apple is fallen out of the Images hand: and also hée hath lost a great part of his Lordship For hée was wont to bée Emperour of Roome, of Gréece, and of all Asia the lesse, of Surry, and of the land of Iudea, in the which is Hierusalem, and of the land of Aegipt, of Percia and Arabia, but he hath lost all but Gréece, and that land he holdeth onely, men would put the apple in the Images hand, but it will not hold it. This apple betokeneth the Lord∣ship that he had ouer all the world, and the other hand he lift∣eth vp against the East, in token to menasse misdoers. This Image standeth vpon a piller of marble.</P>
<P>Likewise at Constantinople is the crosse of our Lord, and his coate without seame, the spunge and the réede with the which the Iewes gaue our Lord gall to drincke on the crosse, and there is one of the nailes that our Lord Iesu Christ was nailed with to the Crosse. Some men thinke that halfe the crosse of Christ is in Cipres in an Abbey of Monkes, that men

</FIGURE> call the hil of the holy crosse, but it is not so, for the crosse that is in Cipres is the Crosse on the which <HI>Dysmas</HI> the good théefe was hanged, but all men wot not that, and that is euill done, but for the getting of the offring they say that it is the crosse of our Lord, and yée shall vnderstand that the crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ was made of foure manner of trées, as it is con∣tained in this verse following.</P>
<P><HI>In Cruce sit Palma, Cedrus, &amp; Cypressus, Oliua.</HI></P>

<P>For the péece that went right vp from the earth vnto the head was of Cipres, and the péece that went ouerthwart to the which his hands were nailed, was of Palme, &amp; the stock that stood within the earth in the which they had made a morteys, was of Ceder, and the table aboue his head was a foote and a halfe long, on which the title was written, that was of Oliue, the Iewes made this crosse of these foure manner of trées, for they thought that our Lord should haue hanged as long as the crosse might last, therfore made they the foot of Ceder, for Ceder may not in the earth ne in water rot, they thought that the bo∣dy of Christ shold haue stoncken, they made the péece that went from the earth vpward of Cipres, so that the smell of his body should grieue no man that came by, and that ouerthwart was made of Palme, in signification of victorie. And the table of the title was made of Oliue, for it betokeneth peace, as the story of <HI>Noe</HI> witnesseth, when the Doue brought the branch of Oliue, that betokened peace made betwéene God and man.</P>
<P>And also you shall vnderstand that the Christian men that dwell ouer the Sea, say that the péece of the crosse that we call Cipres, was of the trée that <HI>Adam</HI> eate the apple off, and so they finde written, and they say also that their Scripture saith, that when <HI>Adam</HI> was sick he said to his son <HI>Seth,</HI> that hée should go to Paradise, and pray the Angel that kéepeth Paradise that he would send him oyle of the trée of mercy, for to annoynt him that hée might haue health, &amp; <HI>Seth</HI> went, but the Angell would not let him come in at the gate, but said vnto him, that he might not haue of the oyle of mercy, but he tooke him thrée carnels of the same trée that his father eate the apple off, and bad him as soone as his father was dead, that hée should put these carnels vnder his tongue &amp; burie him, and he did so, and of these thrée carnels sprang a trée as the Angel said, and when the trée bare fruit, then should <HI>Adam</HI> be made whole. And when <HI>Seth</HI> came againe and found his father dead, hée did with the carnels as the Angell commaunded him, of the which came thrée trées, whereof a Crosse was made that bare good fruit, that is to say, our Sauiour Iesu Christ, through whom <HI>Adam</HI> and all that came of him should be saued &amp; deliuered from euerlasting death,
<PB REF="6"/> but if it be their owne default. This holy crosse had the Iewes hid vnder the earth in the rock of the mount of Caluery, and it lay there two hundred yéeres and more, as they say, vnto the time that Saint <HI>Elene</HI> found it, the which saint <HI>Elene,</HI> was the daughter of <HI>Coel</HI> king of England, that then was called Bri∣taine, and after marryed to <HI>Constantius,</HI> first, Consull, and af∣ter Emperour of Rome, who had by her issue <HI>Constantine</HI> the great, borne in England, and afterward Emperour of Rome, which <HI>Constantine</HI> turned the name of Bezansium into Con∣stantinople, he réedified that Citie, &amp; made it the monarcal seat of all Europa, and Asia Minor: also ye shall vnderstand, that the Crosse of our Lord was in length viij. cubites and the péece that went ouerthwart was thrée cubuites and a halfe.</P>

<P>A part of the crowne of our Lord Iesu Christ wherwith he was crowned &amp; one of the nailes, &amp; the speare head, and many other reliques are in Fraunce at Paris in the chappell of the kings, and the crowne lyeth in a vessel of cristall wel dight and richly, for the French king bought these reliques sometime of the Iewes, to whom the Emperor had laid them to pledge for a great sum of gold. And although men say that this Crowne was of thornes, ye shall vnderstand that it was of Ioukes of the sea, which be white and pricketh as sharp as thornes, for
<PB REF="7"/> I haue séene and beheld many times that at Paris, and that at Constantinople, for they were both of one, &amp; made of Ioukes of the Sea. But men haue departed it in two parts, of the which one part is at Paris, and the other part at Constanti∣nople, and I haue a point thereof that séemeth a white thorne, and that was giuen me for a great friendship: For there are many of them broken &amp; fallen into the vessell, when they shew the crowne to great men or Lords that come thether. And yée shall vnderstand that our Lord in that night that hée was ta∣ken, hée was lead into a Garden, and there hée was examined sharply, and there the Iewes crowned him with a Crowne of Abbespine branches that grew in the same Garden, and set it on his head so fast, that the bloud ranne downe by many pla∣ces of his visage, necke and shoulders, and therefore hath the Abbespine many vertues, for hée that beareth a braunch of it a∣bout him, no thunder, nor no manner of tempest may hurt him, nor the house that it is in may no euill ghost come, nor in no place where it is. And in that same garden saint <HI>Peter</HI> denyed our Lord thrice, and afterward was our Lord lead before the Bishop &amp; Ministers of the Law into another garden of <HI>Anne,</HI> and there hée was examined, scourged, and crowned oft with a swée Thorne, that men call Harbareus that grew in the same Garden, and that hath many vertues. And afterward he was lead to a garden of <HI>Caiaphas</HI> and there he was crowned againe with Eglentine, &amp; after that hée was lead to a chamber of <HI>Pi∣late</HI> and there hée was crowned, and the Iewes set him in a chayre, and clad him in a mantell of purple. And then made they a crowne of Ioukes of the sea, and there they knéeled to him &amp; scorned him saying. <HI>Aue rex Iudeorum.</HI> That is to say, haile king of Iewes. And of this crowne, halfe is at Paris, and the other halfe at Constantinople, the which our sauiour Iesus Christ had on his head, when hée was nailed on the crosse. And the speares shaft hath the Emperour of Almaine, but the head which was put in his side is at Paris, they say, in the holy chap∣pell: and oft times saith the Emperour of Constantinople, that he hath the speares head, &amp; I haue séene it, but it is greater then that at Paris. Also at Constantinople lyeth saint <HI>Anne</HI> our la∣dies
<PB REF="7"/> mother, whom saint <HI>Elene</HI> caused to bée brought from Ie∣rusalem, and ther lieth also the body of saint <HI>Iohn Chrisostome</HI> that was Bishop of Constantinople. There lyeth also Saint <HI>Luke</HI> the Euangelist, for his bones were brought from Betha∣ny where he was buryed: and many other reliquies are there, and ther is of the vessel of stone, as it were marble, which men call Hidrius, that euermore droppeth water, &amp; filleth himselfe euery yeare once. And yée shall wit that Constantinople is a fayre citty and well walled, and it is thrée cornered, and there is an arme of the sea that men call Hellespon, &amp; some men call it the bunch of Constantinople, and some men call it the brach of saint <HI>George:</HI> and this water encloseth two parts of the ci∣tie, &amp; vpward to the sea vpon that water, was wont to bée the great citie of Troy in a faire plaine, but that citie was destroi∣ed by the Gréekes.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Bout Gréece be many Iles that men cal Calastre, Calcas, Settico, Thoysoria, Minona, Faxton, Mo∣lo, Carpate, and Lempne. And in this Ile is mount Athoes that passeth the clouds, and there are di∣uers speaches &amp; many countries that are obedient to the Em∣perour of Constantinople, that is to say, Turcoply, Pincy,
<PB REF="8"/> Narde, Comage, and many other, Thracy and Macedonie, of which <HI>Alexander</HI> was King. In this countrie was <HI>Aristotle</HI> borne, in a Citty that men cal Strageris, a little from the citty of Tragie, and at Strageris is <HI>Aristotle</HI> buried, and there is an Alter on his tombe, and there make they a great feast euery yeare as he were a Saint, and vpon his alter the Lords hold their great counsailes &amp; assembles, &amp; they thinck that through the inspiration of God and him, they should haue the better counsell. In this Countrie are right high hils, there is an hill that men call Olimphus, that parteth Macedonie and Thra∣cia, and is as high as the cloudes, and the other hill that men call Athoes is so high, that the shadow of him stretcheth vnto Olimphus, and it is néere lxxvij. mile betwéene, and aboue that hill is the ayre so cléere that men may féele no winde there, and therefore may no beast liue there the ayre is so dry, and men say in the country that Philosophers somtime went vp to these same hils and held to their noses a spounge wet with water for to haue ayre, for the ayre was so dry there, and aboue in the pouder of the hill they wrote letters with their fingers, and at the yeares end they came againe and found those letters which they had written the yéere before without any default, &amp; there∣fore it séemeth well that these hils passe the cloudes to the pure ayre. At Constantinople is the Emperours Pallaice which is faire and well dight, and therein is a place for iusting, and it is made about with stages that each man may well sée &amp; none grieue other, and vnder these stages are stables vauted for the Emperours horses, &amp; all the pillers of these stables are of mar∣ble. And within the Church of saint <HI>Sophie,</HI> an Emperor would haue laid the body of his Father when hée was dead, and as they made the graue they found a body in the earth, and vpon the body lay a great plate of fine gold, and thervpon was writ∣ten in Ebrew, Gréeke and Latin letters, that said thus. <HI>Iesus Christus nascetur de virgine Maria, &amp; ego credo in eum:</HI> That is to say, Iesu Christ shall be borne of the virgin <HI>Marie</HI> and I beléeue in him. And the date was that it lay in the earth two hundreth yéere béefore our Lord Iesu Christ was borne, and yet is that plate in the treasurie of the Church, &amp; men say that
<PB REF="8"/> it was <HI>Hermogenes</HI> the wise man And neuerthelesse, if it be so men of that Gréece bée Christians, yet they vary from our faith, for they say that the holy Ghost commeth not out of the son, but all onelie of the father, and they are not obedient to the Church of Roome, nor to the Pope, &amp; they say, that their Pa∣triarks haue as much power ouer the sea, as the Pope hath on this side the sea. And therefore Pope <HI>Iohn</HI> the xxij. sent letters to them, how Christian men should bée all one, and that they should be obedient to a Pope that is Christs Vicar on earth, to whom God gaue plaine power to binde and to assoyle, and therefore they should be obedient to him. And they sent him di∣uers aunsweres, and among other they said thus. <HI>Potentiam tuam summam circa subiectos tuos firmiter credimus. Superbi∣am tuam summā tollerare non possimus. Auaritiam tuam sum∣mam satiare non intendimus. Dominus tecū sit, Quia Dominus nobiscum est, Vale.</HI> That is to say. We beléeue well that thy power is great vpon thy subiects. We may not suffer thy pride. We are not in purpose to fulfill thy couetise, our Lord be with thée, for our Lord is with vs, Farewell. And other aunsweare might be not haue of them. And also they make their sacramēt of the Alter of therf bread, for our Lord made it of therf bread, when he made his maund, &amp; on sherthurs day make they their bread in tokening of the maund, and they dry it at the Sun &amp; kéepe it all the yeare, and giue it to sicke men in stead of Gods body. And they make but one vnction when they christen chil∣dren, and they annoint no sick men, and they say there is no purgatory, and soules shall haue neither ioy nor paine vntill the day of dome.</P>
<P>And they say that fornication is no deadly sin, but a kindly thing, and that men and women should wedde but once, and who so weddeth more then once, their children are bastards &amp; gotten in sinne, and their priests also are wedded, and they say that vsurie or simonie is no deadly sin, and they sell benefices of holy Church, and so did men of other places, &amp; it is great slaughter, for now is simonie king crowned in holy Church, God amend it when his wil is. And they say that in lent men should not sing Masse but on the Saterday &amp; on the Sunday,
<PB REF="9"/> and they fast not the Saterday no time in the yéere, but if it be Christmas or Easter euen. And they suffer no man that is on this side the Gréeke sea to sing at their Alters, and if it fall that they do through any hap, they wash their Alters as soone with∣out tarrying with holy water, and they say that there should be but one masse said at one Alter in a day.

Tartary is a full euill land, sandy and a little fruit bearing, for there groweth but little corne or fruite, but Beastes are there great plentie, and therefore eate they flesh without bread, and they sup the broth, and they drinck milcke of all manner of Beasts, they eate cats and all manner of wild beasts, as rats &amp; mice, and they haue little wood, and therefore they dresse their meat with horse doung, and other beast doung when it is dry.

And yée shall vn∣derstand that the Ise there is harder then it is here, and euery man hath a stew in his house, and therein they eate and do all things that them néedeth, and that is at the North part of the world, where it is commonly cold, for the Sun appeareth nor shineth but a little in that country, and that land is in some places so cold that there may no man dwell therin, and on the South side of the world it is in some places so hot that there can no man dwell, the Sunne giueth so great heate in those countries.</P>

<PB REF="36"/> hell, and that beléeue all Sarasins. And if a man aske of what Paradise they meane, they say it is a place of delights, where a man shall finde all manner of fruits at all times, and wa∣ters and riuers running with milke and hony, wine and fresh water, and they shall haue faire houses and good, as they haue deserued, and those houses are made of precious stones, gold, and siluer, and euery man shall haue ten wiues and maydens, and he shall euery day once haue to doe with them, and yet shal they still bée maydens. Also they speake often of the blessed virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and tell of the incarnation, that <HI>Mary</HI> was lear∣ned of Angels, and that <HI>Gabryel</HI> said to her that she was cho∣sen before all other from the beginning of the world, and that witnesseth well their booke: and <HI>Gabriell</HI> told her the incarna∣tion of Iesus Christ, and that she should conceiue and beare a childe, and they say that Christ was a holy Prophet in word and déede, and also méeke and right wise to all men, and one not any blame worthy: and they say that when the Angel told to her of the incarnation, she had great dread for shée was very young, and there was one in that Country that practised sor∣cery who was called <HI>Takina,</HI> that with inchauntments could make him like an Angell and he went often and lay with mai∣dens, and therefore was <HI>Mary</HI> the more afraid of the Angell, and thought in her minde that it had béene <HI>Takina</HI> who went to maydens, and shée charged him in the name of God to tell her if he were the same <HI>Takina,</HI> and the Angell bad her haue no dread, for hée was for certaine a true messenger of Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>Also their booke of Alkaron saith that shée had a childe vn∣der a Palme trée, then was shée greatly ashamed and wished her selfe dead, but as soone as her childe was borne, hée spake and comforted her saying, <HI>Ne timeas Maria.</HI> That is to say. Be not afraid <HI>Mary.</HI> And in many other places saith their booke Al∣karon, that Iesus Christ spake as soone as hée was borne, and the booke saith that Iesu Christ was sent of almightie God to bée ensample to all men, and that God shall Iudge all men, the good to heauen, and the wicked to hell, &amp; that Iesus Christ is the best Prophet of all other, and next to God, and that he

And their booke Alkaron speaketh of Iewes and saith, they are wicked people, for they will not beléeue that Iesus Christ is of God. Also they say that the Iewes speake falsely of our Lady and her sonne Iesus Christ, saying that they did not hang him on the Crosse, for Sarasins beléeue so néere our faith, that they are easily conuerted, when men preach the law of Iesus Christ, and they say that they know right wel by their Prophesite, that their law of Mahomet shall faile, as doth the Law of the Iewes, and that the law of Christians shall last to the worlds end. And if a man aske them wherein they beléeue, they say that they beléeue in God Almightie, that is the maker of heauen and earth, and all other things, and without him is nothing done, and at the day of Iudgement euery man shall bée rewarded after his deseruing, and that all things is trueth that Christ said by the mouthes of the Prophets.</P>

Moreouer where men speake of the Father, and the Sonne and the holy Ghost, they say that they are thrée persons but not one God, for their booke Alkaron speaketh not thereof, nor of the Trini∣tie, but they say that God spake or else he was dumbe, &amp; that God had a Ghost or else hée was not aliue, and they say Gods word hath great strength, and so saith their Alkaron, and they say that <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Moyses</HI> were greatly in fauour with
<PB REF="37"/> God, for they spake with him, and <HI>Mahomet</HI> was a right mes∣senger of God, and they haue many good articles of our faith, and some vnderstand the Scriptures, Prophets, Gospels, and the Bible, for they haue them written in their language, in their manner they know holy writ, but they vnderstand if not but after the letter, and so doe the Iewes, for they vnderstand it not but after their letter spiritually, and therefore saith Saint <HI>Paul, Litera occidit spiritus autem viuificat.</HI> That is to say, the letter killeth but the spirit quickneth, and the Sarasins say that the Iewes are wicked, for they kéepe not the Law of <HI>Moyses</HI> the which hée tooke to them, and also Christians are euill, for they kéepe not the commandements of the Gospels, that Iesu Christ sent vnto them, and therefore I shall tell you what the Souldan told mée vpon a day in his chamber shutting out all other men, as Lords, Knights and other: for hée would speake with mée in counsell, and then asked hée mée how Christians gouerned them in our country, and I answeared him and said, right well thanks bée to God, and hée said secretly nay, for hée said that our Priests made no force of Gods seruice: for they should giue good example to men to doe well, and they giue ill example, and therefore when the people should goe on the ho∣lidayes to Church to serue God, they goe to the Tauerne to sin in gluttony both day &amp; night, and eat and drink as beasts that wot not when they haue enough, and also Christians (he said) forced them to fight together, and one to beguile other, and they are so proud that they know not how they may cloth them, now short, now long, now strait, now wide, of all manner of fashions. They should bée simple, méeke and soft, and doe their almes as Iesus Christ did, in whom they beléeue, and hée sayd they are so couetouse, that for a little money they sell their chil∣dren, their sisters, and their wiues, and one taketh another mans wife and none kéepeth his promise to another, therefore said he, for their sins God hath giuen these lands to our hands, and not through our strength, but all for your sins. For wée wot well, that when that yée serue well your God, that he will helpe you, so that no men shall win of you if that yée serue your God as yée ought to doe, but while they liue so sinfully
<PB REF="38"/> as they doe, wée haue no dread on them, for their God shall not helpe them. And then I asked him how that hee knew the state of Christians in that manner, and hée sayd that he knew well both of Lords and commons, by his messengers which hée sent through all the countries as it were marchants with precious stones and other marchandise to know the manner of euery country. And then hée did call againe all the Lords into his chamber to vs, and then shewed hée vnto mée thrée persons that were great Lords of that country, who shewed vnto mée the manner of my country, and of all Christendome, as though they had béene men borne in the same parties, and they spake french right well and the Souldan also, and then I had great meruaile of this slaunder of our faith, and so they that should bée turned by our good examples to the faith of Iesus Christ, they are drawne away through our euill liuing, and therefore it is no wonder if that they call vs euill, for they say truth, but the Sarasins are true, for they kéepe truely the commaunde∣ments of their Alkaron.</P>

In this cittie lyeth Saint <HI>Athanasius,</HI> that was bishop of Alexandria, that made the Psalme <HI>Quicunque vult.</HI></P>
<P>This man was a great Doctor of Diuinitie, and of the Godhead, hée was accused vnto the Pope of Roome, that hée was an Heritike, and the Pope sent for him and put him in prison, and while hée was in that prison, he made this Psalme and sent it vnto the Pope, and said it that he were an Heritike, then was that Herisie, for that was his faith and his beliefe: and when the Pope saw that hée had said therein was all our faith, then anone hée did deliuer him out of prison, and hée com∣manded that Psalme to be said euery day at the beginning of of seruice, &amp; so hée held <HI>Athanasius</HI> for a good Christian, but hée would neuer after go to his Bishoprike, because they accused him of Heresie.

Then this faire Lady answered, and said vn∣to him, that hée was a foole, for hée wist not what hée asked, for hèe might not haue her, for hée should haue asked of her onely worldly things, and shée was not worldly. And the king said hée would naught else, and shée sayd, sith hée would aske naught else, shée would graunt him and all that came after him, thrée things, and said vnto him: Sir king, yée shall haue warre without peace, vnto the ninth degrée, and yée shal be in subiection vnto your enimies, and yée shall haue great néede of good cattell, and since that time all the Kings of Armonie haue béene in warre and néedful, and vnder tribute of the Sa∣rasins.

Now shall I tell of some lands, countries and Iles that are beyond the land of Cathay. Who so goeth from Cathay to Inde the high and the low, hée shall goe through a kingdome that men call Cadissen, and it is a great land, there groweth a manner of fruit as it were gourdes, and when it is ripe, men cut it a sunder, and they finde therein a beast as it were of flesh, and bone, &amp; blood, as it were a little lambe without wooll, and men eate the beast and fruit also, and sure it séemeth very strange. Neuerthelesse I sayd to them that I held that for no meruaile, for I said that in my country are trées that beare fruit that become birds fly∣ing &amp; they are good to eat, and that that falleth on the water li∣ueth, and that that falleth on the earth dyeth, and they meruai∣led much thereat. In this land and many other therabout, are trées that beare cloues, and nutmegs, and chanell, and many other spices, and there be vines that beare so great grapes that a strong man shall haue enough to beare a cluster of grapes. In that same land are the hils of Caspy that men call Vber, and enclosed within those hils are the Iewes of the x. kindes that men call <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> and they may come out on no side.

Here some men might aske, if there be a sea on one side, why goe they not out there, for thereto aun∣swere I that although it be called a sea, it is not a sea, but a poole standing among hils, and it is the greatest Poole of all the world, and though they go ouer that poole, yet they wot not where to ariue, for they can no speach but their owne. And yée shall vnderstand that these Iewes which dwel among the hils haue no law among them, and yet they pay tribute for their land to the Quéene of Armony: and sometime it is so that some of these Iewes goe ouer the hils, but many may not passe there together for the hils are so great and high. Neuerthelesse, men say in that country thereby that in the time of Antichrist they shall doe much harme to christian men, and therefore all the Iewes that dwell in diuers parts of the world learne for to speake Ebrew, for they hope that these Iewes that dwell
<PB REF="67"/> among the hils aforesaid shal come out of the hils and speake all Ebrew and nought else, and then shall these Iewes speake Ebrew to them and lead them into Christendome for to de∣stroy Christian men.

And if yée will know how they shall finde the passage out, as I haue vnder∣stood I shall tell you. In the time of Antichrist a Foxe shall make his denne in the same place where King <HI>Alexander</HI> did make the Gates, and hée shall dig in the earth so long till hée pierce it through and come among the Iewes, and when they sée the Foxe, they shall haue great meruaile of him, for they neuer saw such a beast, but other Beastes haue they among them many, and they shall chase this foxe and pursue him vn∣till that hée bée fled againe into his hole that he came from, and then shall they dig after him vntill they come to the gates that <HI>Alexander</HI> did make of great stones well dight with morter, then shall they breake these gates and they shall finde the way forth.</P>
