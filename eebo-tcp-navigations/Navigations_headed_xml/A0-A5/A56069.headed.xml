<P><HI>Hungary</HI> extendeth in length from <HI>Presburg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The length, &amp; breadth of it.</NOTE> along the <HI>Da∣now,</HI> to the borders of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> for the space of three hun∣dred <HI>English</HI> miles, &amp; one hundred and ninty of the same miles in breadth: The longest Summers Day in the Southern parts, is fifteen hours, and a half, and not above sixteen hours in the Northermost parts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Divi∣sion of it.</NOTE> <HI>Hungary</HI> is commonly divided into the <HI>Upper Hungary,</HI> and the <HI>Lower:</HI> The <HI>Ʋpper</HI> lies on the North of the River <HI>Danow,</HI> out of the bounds, and territories of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire: The <HI>Lower</HI> lies on the South of the <HI>Danow,</HI> and comprehends all <HI>Pannonia Inferior,</HI> and part of <HI>Superior,</HI> which were formerly two <HI>Roman</HI> Provinces.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ʋpper Hungary</HI> is subdivided (before the coming in of the <HI>Turks</HI>) into thirty two Counties, thar is to say, twenty four on the West side of <HI>Tibiscus</HI> (or the River <HI>Tisse</HI>) and eight on the East side of the same River. The <HI>Lower</HI> is divided into eighteen Counties, of which ten were between the <HI>Danow,</HI> and the River <HI>Dravus;</HI> and the other six between
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> the <HI>Danow,</HI> and the River <HI>Savus.</HI> But this Division, and the Subdivisions depending upon it, being, since the coming in of the <HI>Turks</HI> almost out of use, we will now look upon it as it stands divided for the present (or lately did) betwixt the Em∣peror, as King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> by a mixt Title of Descent, and Election, and the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> as Lord of the most part of it by Arms and Conquest, two parts of three at least being in his Possession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Towns in the Em∣perors Part.</NOTE>The chief places in the Emperors Part are, 1. <HI>Sabria,</HI> an∣ciently the chief City of <HI>Pannonia Superior,</HI> by the <HI>Hungarians</HI> called <HI>Kimarorubath,</HI> and by the Dutch, <HI>Leibnits.</HI> 2. <HI>Stri∣don,</HI> the Birth-place of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Jerome,</HI> one of the four chief Fa∣thers of the <HI>Latine</HI> Church, situate in the confines of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> commonly called <HI>Strigman.</HI> 3. <HI>A∣gria,</HI> a Bishops See. 4. <HI>Nitri,</HI> a Bishops See also, on the River <HI>Boch.</HI> 5. <HI>Sopran,</HI> on the Borders of <HI>Austria.</HI> 6. <HI>Komara,</HI> a strong piece, standing in an Island of the same name, made by the <HI>Danow.</HI> 7. <HI>Presburg</HI> on the edge of <HI>Austria,</HI> on the North side of that River, called by the <HI>Latines, Possonium:</HI> It's seated in a pleasant healthful Coun∣try on the River <HI>Lyet,</HI> which there falls into the <HI>Danow:</HI> in the Suburbs whereof, upon the top of an high Mountain, standeth a Stately Castle, the ordinary residence of the Em∣perors, as Kings of <HI>Hungary.</HI> For though it be a little City, and not very beautiful, yet being secured by the neighbor∣hood of <HI>Austria,</HI> it hath been made the Regal City of <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> since <HI>Buda</HI> was lost. Before the walls hereof died Count <HI>Dampier,</HI> one of the chief Commanders of the Emperor <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI> the second, in the wars of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Bohemia.</HI> 8. <HI>Gran,</HI> called <HI>Strigonium,</HI> which was taken by the <HI>Turks, Anno Christi</HI> 1534, and won again by the Christians 1595, at which time S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Arundel</HI> of <HI>Wardour</HI> Castle in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Tho.

For going privatly to view some places of advantage whereby to make a general assault, he fell into an Ambush of <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who suddenly set upon him, discomfitted his small Party, kill∣ed, first his Horse under him, and at last himself, having in that Skirmish received sixteen wounds. Here was also slain with him at the same time, <HI>Torquato,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Prince, Count <HI>Verdugo,</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Earl, and one of the <HI>Gouragas,</HI> of the house of <HI>Mantua.</HI> It is lately taken by the <HI>Turk.</HI> 11. <HI>Alten∣bourg.</HI> 12. <HI>Tockay,</HI> both of them strong by the natural site: and 13. <HI>Castel-Novo,</HI> made strong by Art.</P>
<P>Places of most Importance in the <HI>Turks</HI> possession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Towns in the <HI>Turks</HI> part.</NOTE> are 1. <HI>Buda,</HI> by the <HI>Dutch</HI> called <HI>Hoffen.</HI> This City is unevenly seated amongst Hills, on the South side of the <HI>Danow,</HI> but in the most fruitful part of all the Country; Its exceeding strongly fortified, and adorned with many fair buildings, both private and publick; and furnished with some Medicinal Baths, which owe much of their pomp, and sumptuousness to their New Masters, the <HI>Turks,</HI> who took it from the Chri∣stians, <HI>August</HI> 20. <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1526. <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent being present at the taking of it. Before that time, it was the seat Royal of the Kings of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the chief City of the Kingdom; As now it is the seat of the chief <HI>Bassa,</HI> or Lord Lieutenant for the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> 2. <HI>Abba
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> Regalis,</HI> by the <HI>Dutch</HI> called <HI>Stul-Weisenburg,</HI> situated be∣tween the <HI>Danow</HI> and the <HI>Dravus,</HI> strongly, but unwholsomly seated in the midst of an inaccessibile Marish, which is joyned to the firm land by three broad Causeys, blocked up at the ends with three great Bulworks. But notwithstanding its strong situation, it was taken by the <HI>Turks, Anno Christi</HI> 1543. Before which time, it was the usual place, both for the Coro∣nation, and Interment of the Kings of <HI>Hungary.</HI> 3. <HI>Volue,</HI> on the <HI>Danow,</HI> taken in the same year also. 4. <HI>Fiese-kirken,</HI> called in <HI>Latine Quin{que}, Ecclesiae,</HI> from five Churches in it. A Bishops See,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It was this last year bur∣ned down by Count <HI>Serini.</HI></NOTE> which was taken by the <HI>Turks, Anno Christi</HI> 1566. and gave them a great command upon the River <HI>Dravus,</HI> upon which it is seated. 5 <HI>Sirmisch,</HI> situated between the <HI>Danow</HI> and <HI>Savus,</HI> noted for yielding the best Wines, but it is a City otherwise of no estimation for the present, though formerly of the most account in all this Province, the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Pan∣nonia inferior:</HI> honoured with the presence and personal resi∣dence of many of the Emperors, and in those respects made the Stage of many great and memorable Actions. Here was held a Council against the <HI>Heretick Photinus,</HI> Bishop of this City, who held, that Christ had no existence of God the Father, till he was conceived, and born of the Virgin <HI>Mary, Anno Christi</HI> 356. 6. <HI>Zigeth,</HI> a strong Town, situate on a Marish ground on the North side of the River <HI>Dravus,</HI> which was taken by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1566, who there ended his Days. 7. <HI>Keresture;</HI> nigh unto which, in the year 1596 <HI>Mahomet</HI> the third gave unto the Christians so great an overthrow, that probably, if he had pursued his Victory, he had made a full Conquest of all <HI>Hun∣gary.</HI> 8. <HI>Mursa,</HI> upon the confluence of the <HI>Dravus,</HI> and the <HI>Danow.</HI> 9. <HI>Belgrade,</HI> on the confluence of the <HI>Savus</HI> and the <HI>Danow:</HI> called by the <HI>Dutch, Greek Wessenburg:</HI> Its called <HI>Belgrad</HI> from the beautiful situation of it. Its hemmed in on the North with the <HI>Danow,</HI> on the East with the <HI>Savus,</HI> on the other sides its defended with very strong Walls, deep Ditches, and impregnable Ramparts. It belonged anciently to the Despots of <HI>Servia,</HI> by whom it was consigned over to <HI>Sigis∣mund,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> as best able to keep it, the Despot
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> being satisfied with Lands and other Territories of a better value. Heretofore it was the Bulwork of Christendom against the <HI>Turks,</HI> who received before it many great, and notable re∣pulses, of which the most memorable were those of <HI>Amurath</HI> the second, and <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Great: It was taken at last (to the great loss, and shame of the Christian world, who relieved not the besieged in due time) by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1520.</P>
<P>On the North side of the Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> there is, 10 <HI>Pesth,</HI> over against <HI>Buda,</HI> on the River <HI>Danow.</HI> 11. <HI>Vaccia,</HI> on the same River, a Bishops See. 12. <HI>Colocza,</HI> an Archb shops See, on the same River also. 13. <HI>Zegedin,</HI> on the West side of the River <HI>Tibiscus.</HI> 14. <HI>Temeswar,</HI> on the East of that Ri∣ver towards <HI>Transylvania:</HI> which is the ordinary residence of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Bassa. 15. <HI>Gyula,</HI> a strong Town on the Bor∣ders of <HI>Transylavania,</HI> which was betrayed by <HI>Nicholas Keres∣ken,</HI> the Governor thereof, in the last year of <HI>Solyman,</HI> upon promise of a great reward: But <HI>Selimus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Solyman,</HI> caused him to be shut up in a Barrel, knocked full of nails, with the points inwards, and so to be tumbled up and down till he dyed most miserably. On the Barrel there was this In∣scription written: <HI>Here receive the reward of thy Covetousness and Treason:</HI> Gyula, <HI>thou soldest for Gold. If thou best not faithful to</HI> Maximilian, <HI>thy Natural Lord, neither wilt thou be true to me.</HI> 16. <HI>Singidon,</HI> on the South side of <HI>Gyula,</HI> betwixt which, and <HI>Belgrade</HI> are the Fields of <HI>Maxon,</HI> famous for the slaughter of fifty thousand <HI>Turks,</HI> slain here in Battel, under the prudent conduct of <HI>John Huniades:</HI> Anno 1456.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Hungary</HI> are strong of Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The qua∣lity of the People.</NOTE> but somewhat rude of behaviour, respecting neither the Liberall Arts, nor Mechanick Trades. The greatest aspersion is the name of a <HI>Coward,</HI> which cannot be wiped off, without the killing of a <HI>Turk,</HI> after which they are priviledged to wear a Feather, and by the number of their Feathers to shew how many <HI>Turks</HI> they have slain in Battel. They delight in Wars, &amp; like no Trade better, desiring rather to live upon other mens labors, then upon their own. They are extream covetous, yet they have rather a desire, then any Art to enrich themselves, per∣miting
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> the <HI>Dutch</HI> to ingross all their Trading, and to mannage such Commodities as their Country yields, which is the cause (seconded by the oppressions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Austrian</HI> Fa∣mily, under whom they are) that none of them rise to any considerable Wealth. And for such as have lands, they grow poorer every Day then other. For though the Females be ex∣cluded from inheriting their Fathers Possessions (to whom they give no Portion, but new clothes on their Wedding day) yet, seeing the Sons do equally share their Fathers estate a∣mongst them (as such who hold in <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> do here in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>) it must needs be, that by so many Divisions, and Sub∣divisions, the greatest Patrimony that is, will be brought to little. Both Sexes in their education are inured to hardship, being not suffered to lie in Beds till the night of their mar∣riage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarians</HI> at this day contemn ease, and pleasure, and live not in Towns but as strangers, with a design to be soon gone. Great men lodge their delights in their Gardens, and Baths, and care not for their Buildings, but desire to live at large. The Common People live in Cabins, and little lodg∣ings ill made.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habit.</NOTE>Their Garments are long and stately, their Womens Gar∣ments are straight, and cover them unto the neck; they wear upon their Gowns, long Cloaks, and they cover their Heads with Vails, or Linnen Cloth, and hide all but their eyes and nose; and most of them wear Pearls, and precious stones. Al∣so both men and women wear Buskins up to the calf of the Leg; they mourn a whole year for their Friends and Kins∣folks when they die, and sometimes two years; they shave their Beards, and leave nothing but their Must<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches, which are sometimes very long. They have a particular Language, which differs not much from the <HI>Bohemians:</HI> and they have also a perticular form of Letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scla∣vonian</HI> Language.</NOTE> yet most commonly they use the <HI>Roman</HI> Characters; they are very proud and haughty, strong in War, and are better Souldiers on Horseback th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n on Foot; they are very obedient to the Prince, and his Leiu∣tenants. In the parts adjoyning to <HI>Germany</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Lan∣guage is most used.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<P>The soil in <HI>Hungary</HI> is wonderful fruitful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their commodi∣ties.</NOTE> yielding Corn and Fruits in great abundance: The Grass in some places (as in the Isle of <HI>Comora</HI>) exceeds the heigth of a man, which doth breed such a number of Cattel, that this Country alone, is thought to be able to serve all <HI>Europe</HI> with flesh: they yearly send into <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Sclavonia</HI> eight thousand Oxen. They have Deer, Partridge, Pheasant in such superfluity that any man that will, may kill them. The other commodities of the Country are, store of Silver, Copper, Iron, Steel, Tin, Lead, Vitrial, which they send into divers Countries; Yea, and Gold, which they not onely find in Mines, but also in the Sand of some of their Rivers. There are also great store of Sheep, Stags, Fallow Deer, Goates, Hares, wild Boars, Wolves, Bears, and such like beasts: Besides Goshawkes, and many other Birds.</P>
<P>There is scarce any other Country that hath more and greater Rivers than <HI>Hungary,</HI> nor more Navigable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ri∣vers.</NOTE> nor better stored with Fish: There is the <HI>Danow,</HI> which, rising out of <HI>Nigra Sylva,</HI> or the <HI>Schwartzen-Wald,</HI> as the <HI>Germans</HI> call it, at a little Village of <HI>Schwaben,</HI> about two <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles from the Shoars of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> passeth through <HI>Schwaben, Bavaria, Au∣stria, Hungary,</HI> &amp;c. and runs by the Cities of <HI>Ulm, Regens∣berg, Passaw, Vienna, Rab, Buda,</HI> &amp;c <HI>Belgrade,</HI> beyond w<SUP>ch</SUP> it be∣ginneth to be called <HI>Ister,</HI> and receiving into its channel, from the long Tracts of the <HI>Alps,</HI> the <HI>Sarmatian,</HI> and <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains, above sixty Navigable Rivers, besides lesser Brooks, disgorgeth his full stomach out of seven Mouths into the lap of the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea: the whole length of his course being fifteen hundred Miles.

In the Territory of <HI>Zepus</HI> there are waters in which Wood is turned into Stone: and neer unto S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Martins</HI> Church, in the same place, there is a water which seems to boil, the which turns into stone, both above and under ground, and this Stone is almost like unto the <HI>Pumeise.</HI></P>
<P>In the Country of <HI>Zolie,</HI> there is a Gulf, or breach in the ground, which casts forth such a deadly stink as it kills the Birds that fly over it. Neer unto <HI>Javerin</HI> upon the Banks of the River <HI>Danow,</HI> towards the East, are to be seen, some re∣mainders of <HI>Trajans</HI> Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Trajans</HI> Bridge.</NOTE> built upon that River in <HI>Moesia,</HI> an admirable and memorable work, consisting of twenty Arches of square stone, which Arches were a hundred and fifty foot high, besides the foundation, and sixty foot broad, and each Arch was seventy foot wide. Its a thing to be admired by
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> what means, force, or Art they could build these several Pil∣lars in this deep and violent stream, and lay the foundations of so great a burden, the bottom of the River being so deep of mud, and there being no means to turn the course of the Water, he Arches above the Water were demolished by the command of <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperor, but the Piles stand still, for a Testimony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Posterity, that there was nothing impossible to the power and wealth of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>

<P>The Christian Faith was first planted here in the time of King <HI>Steven,</HI> surnamed the Saint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They re∣ceive the Christian Faith.</NOTE> being invited and perswaded thereunto by the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the second, who, upon this condition, gave to this <HI>Steven</HI> in marriage his Sister <HI>Gilla;</HI> and it was effected by the preaching and industry of <HI>Albert,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Prague.

But now, <HI>Mahumatism</HI> is much spread over a great part of it; by reason of those many places which the <HI>Turks</HI> hold in it.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Govern∣ment.</NOTE>The King of <HI>Hungary</HI> Governs his Realm chiefly by two Magistrates; yet in the Upper <HI>Hungary</HI> there used to be three Magistrates. The first Governs the Realm in the Kings Name. The chief Magistrate is the Palatine of the Realm, who is next unto the King, and Judges the King himself, if he be accused. He is chosen by the People, and his Office is not Hereditary. There is also the Judge of the Court, who is one of the ordi∣nary Judges of the Realm. Then the perpetual Chancellor, who is the Archbishop of <HI>Strigonium,</HI> the Primate of the King∣dom, and the Chief Secretary; His Office is to Annoint the King when he is chosen; and to Seal all Patents, and Privi∣ledges. There is also the Master of the Court, who must of ne∣cessity follow the King, and is his neerest Counsellor. There is also the Master of the Royal Tavernies, who hath the charge of Mines, and Saltpits, and doth Judge of causes which concern the Kings revenues in Towns, Burroughs, and Castles.</P>
<P>The second Magistrate is appointed for matters of Justice, and this Magistracy comprehends three Officers of very great authority, that is, the Vice Palatine of the Realm, the Per∣sonal Judge of the Presence, who holds the Kings place in Judgements, and is above all other Judges, and the Vice-Judge of the Court. The Inferior Officers are those, who are rather Executioners of Judgement than Magistrates; and there are two Protonotaries of the Personal Judge, one of the Vice-Palatine, and one of the Vice-Judge of the Court. All these are called Masters, and have joyned to them the Archbishop of <HI>Strigoniums</HI> Secretary, who is called <HI>Fiscall,</HI> besides twelve Assistants, and certain sworn Notaries.</P>
<P>Besides all these, there are the Kings Officers, as the Trea∣surer,
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> the High Chamberlain, and other Chamberlains; the Lord Steward of the Kings House, and other Masters of the Houshold; the Chief Cup-Bearer; Gentlemen Servants; Ushers, and many other Inferior Officers.</P>
<P>This Kingdom of <HI>Hungary</HI> hath ever been Elective,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Kingdom is Elective.</NOTE> and hath had special Priviledges indulged them by their former Kings. King <HI>Andrew</HI> gave Authority to his Prelates, Peers, and People, that without any imputation of disloyalty, they might contradict, oppose, and resist their King, if he did any thing in Violation of their Laws and Sanctions: as D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Heylin</HI> saith in his <HI>Geography.</HI> p. 189. But since the house of <HI>Au∣stria</HI> came to possess this Crown of <HI>Hungary,</HI> they have made their Government more absolute, and the People more ser∣vile, having lost much of their former Liberty, and Priviledges. For in their ancient Government, when as their Kings meant to undertake War, to conclude a Peace, or to alter any thing in the Government of the Commonwealth, their manner was to assemble the Barons, Bishops, and Gentlemen at a certain place, where, by the consent of the greater part, their Kings had power to confirm, abrogate, or make Laws; To denounce War, to conclude Peace, and to charge their Lands with Im∣positions, and Taxes according as necessity required; Which Assemblies are still in use, but the freedom thereof, is much retrenched, and impaired, there being now nothing propoun∣ded to these Assemblies by their new Governors, but to raise a Contribution of Mony to resist the <HI>Turk</HI> when he threatens any Invasion, to which demand, the Estates give their resolu∣tion by a certain Day.</P>
<P>They Judge according to Written Laws; but they have an∣other kind of deciding controversies which happen amongst them; For if the matter be difficult to end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial by Combate.</NOTE> they ordain that it shall be tryed by Combate betwixt the Parties, the which is performed in the presence of the King or his Lieutenant, and the victory is adjudged to the stronger; and he is judged Vi∣ctorious, that doth so amase his enemy at his first approach, as that he retires out of the Field, or being in combate, is so pursued, as that he is forced to abandon the place that is li∣mited to them. They that fight on Horseback, charge first with
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> their Lances, and then they fall to it with their Swords; and for such as fight on foot, they have their privy parts covered, and all the rest of their body is naked.</P>
<P>Only the males (as was said before) inherit; and if they die without Sons, the Daughters do not succeed, but the Lands of the deceased fall by <HI>Escheat</HI> to the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their strength.</NOTE>The forces of this Kingdom whilst it was entire, may best be Judged of, by those great Armies which they have brought in∣to the Field against the <HI>Turk:</HI> But now two parts of three of <HI>Hungary</HI> being subdued by the <HI>Turks,</HI> that which remains is not able to answer the proportion of former times.</P>
<P>The foot Souldiers are commonly but meanly armed; the defect whereof is rather to be imputed to Prince than to the People, who can but bring their Bodies (which is all they have) for the defence of their Country. Their Horsemen (which are called <HI>Heiducks</HI>) are maintained in a continual readiness, at the charge of the Nobility, and principal Gentry. These are Cousin-Germans to the <HI>Cossacques,</HI> almost as cruel, and mis∣chievous as they.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Re∣venues.</NOTE>The chief Revenues of this Kingdom come from the Silver Mines, out of which is yearly raised about a Million and an half of Guilders. But <HI>Maximilian</HI> the second, made it up two Millions by seizing on the Lands of the Cathedrall, and Collegiat Churches; and assigning annual Pensions to the Bi∣shops, Canons, and other Religious Persons: Most of which summes come cleerly to the Emperors Coffers; the Presidiary Souldiers being paid with Contribution Money, raised out of the Peoples purses; and the Lieutenant Generals Salary, which comes to thirty thousand Dollars by the year, is defrayed out of their purses also.</P>
<P>Not to speak any thing of the first Inhabitants of this King∣dom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> so many ages since extinct, we will come to the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> the last and Principal Actors upon the Stage of this Kingdom, and the givers of the present Name to it: be∣fore whose coming into it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Called formerly <HI>Pannonia.</HI></NOTE> it was called <HI>Pannonia.</HI> These <HI>Hungari</HI> were a <HI>Scythian</HI> People, first known in <HI>Europe</HI> by their acts in the time of the Emperor <HI>Arnulphus,</HI> when wandring in <HI>Sarmatia Europaea,</HI> they were by him called into this Coun∣try
<PB N="13" REF="8"/> to assist him against <HI>Suantobogius,</HI> King of the <HI>Moravians,</HI> from whom they took <HI>Transylvania,</HI> and so much of <HI>Hungary</HI> as lies on both sides of the River <HI>Tisse,</HI> inhabited at that time by the <HI>Sclaves,</HI> and some scattered remnants of the <HI>Avares,</HI> whom they killed, or forced to seek new habitations, planting them∣selves in those places which they took from them, which is now the Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> after which they passed the <HI>Danow</HI> and subdued <HI>Pannonia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An account of the Controversies which have happened in the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> since the Peace that was made with the <HI>Turks. Anno Christi 1605, to 1663.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The controversies which happened in <HI>Hungary,</HI> as well for Religion, as for the charges, and Commands in Armies, were the causes of many, and great mischiefs. For <HI>Botzkay Ist∣ham,</HI> Duke of <HI>Kismaria,</HI> and Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> revolted from the Emperor, having drawn many Noble men of <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> to joyn with him upon assurance of assistance from the <HI>Turk;</HI> Then did <HI>Botzkay</HI> take the field with great numbers of <HI>Heiducks,</HI> and made a Declaration against the Emperors Lieu∣tenants, which were four, who joyning their Forces together, went against <HI>Botzkay.</HI> When the Armies met, the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> both Horse and Foot yielded to <HI>Botzkay;</HI> The fight continu∣ed six hours, and the Imperialists were routed, <HI>Belliceuse,</HI> one of their Generals, fled, and the <HI>Germans,</HI> and <HI>Silesians</HI> were cut in pieces; <HI>Pets,</HI> and <HI>Pallas Lippay,</HI> were taken Prisoners, and <HI>Botzkay</HI> sent <HI>Pets,</HI> and some Ensigns to <HI>Herder Bassa,</HI> to shew his affection to the <HI>Turk:</HI> and <HI>Pallas Lippay</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="11"/> remained Lieutenant to <HI>Botzkay:</HI> and they published another Declaration, that they took up Arms for their Civil Liberties, and Consciences, and to hinder the Persecution of the Gospel.</P>
<P>Hereupon the <HI>Roman</HI> Clergy, &amp; Jesuites were forced to fly to <HI>Vienna;</HI> and the Citizens of <HI>Cassovia</HI> thrust the Priests and Clergy out of their Towns, and became Protestants of the <HI>Augustane</HI> Confession. <HI>Baste,</HI> the Emperors Lieutenant, pub∣lished a General Pardon in his Masters name, but it prevailed nothing; He also besieged <HI>Cassovia</HI> in vain, the Garison con∣sisting of six thousand men. Having raised his Siege, in his return, he took <HI>Epper,</HI> and some weaker places, upon condition to suffer them to enjoy their Religion according to the Confes∣sion of <HI>Ausbourg:</HI> But being pursued by <HI>Botzkay,</HI> he lost thirty Waggons laden with Silver, and store of Clothes that came from <HI>Vienna.</HI> This so amazed the neighbour places, that the <HI>Germans,</HI> and other Strangers were cut in pieces.</P>
<P>Then did <HI>Baste</HI> perswade <HI>Botzkay</HI> by his letters, to hearken to peace, and to draw the Emperors Subjects to their obedi∣ence: <HI>Botzkay</HI> answered, that he was content, upon condition that he should enjoy the Principality of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> and be the Emperors Lieutenant in <HI>Hungary.</HI> That the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Walloons</HI> should depart the Country: That the Souldiers should be paid; That the Protestants should not be molested in the exercise of their Religion: That <HI>Belliceuse</HI> (who was the cause of these troubles) should be delivered into his hands to do justice upon him; and that the Emperor should come in Person to the Estates at <HI>Ponson,</HI> and in the mean time the <HI>Germans</HI> should not stir out of the Garisons to plunder the Countrey.</P>
<P><HI>Baste</HI> seeing these demands so high, returned no answer.

<P>Then did <HI>Botzkay</HI> send Ambassadors to <HI>Vienna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace conclu∣ded.</NOTE> where at last a Peace was concluded in the year 1606, and the Moneth of <HI>September,</HI> which consisted of these six Articles.</P>

<P>The Bassa of <HI>Buda</HI> treated the Christians with great Magni∣ficence, giving to each of them rich Presents. There was great joy at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and in the Emperors Countries for this Peace.</P>
<P>But <HI>Botzkay</HI> dying shortly after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New troubles.</NOTE> caused great alterations in these Provinces; and the Peace was ill observed in <HI>Hungary</HI> by reason of the Roads that were made by the Imperialists and others; To prevent which, there was an Assembly called of all the Nobility of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Transylvania,</HI> who desired that their King might reside in <HI>Hungary,</HI> that his presence might suppress these combustions; and the Archduke <HI>Mat∣thias</HI> not coming within seven days, they made a Protestation against him for not coming, and so departed to their homes. The Noble men of Upper <HI>Hungary</HI> held another Assembly at <HI>Cassovia, October</HI> the 14<SUP>th</SUP>, where they resolved, that <HI>Hungary</HI> should not be divided from <HI>Transylvania.</HI> But the <HI>Heiducks</HI> being discontented notwithstanding these Assemblies, did not forbear their ravaging; they took divers Castles, and de∣clared themselves Friends to the <HI>Turk,</HI> and enemies to the <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI> and <HI>Walloons.</HI></P>
<P>Then came the Archduke <HI>Matthias</HI> to <HI>Presbourg;</HI> the Bi∣shop of <HI>Javerin,</HI> and all the Nobility were there to receive him. The Cardinal Archbishop of <HI>Gran</HI> arrived also, and <HI>Helias Hasky,</HI> with many Deputies from High <HI>Hungary;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parla∣ment.</NOTE> the Parla∣ment began, <HI>Jan.</HI> 23. 1608. The Cardinal and the Clergy would have moderated the Peace made with <HI>Botzkay,</HI> but <HI>He∣lias Hasky,</HI> with the Deputies of Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> opposed it, saying, that this Assembly was called onely to suppress the <HI>Heiducks;</HI> the Archdukes Deputies proposed that there might be a League Offensive, and Defensive; and some dis∣sention arose betwixt the Clergy and Nobles, but at last it was pacified, and concluded that they should not alter any thing in the peace made at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and that the said League should be made betwixt the Estates and the Country. As for the discontented <HI>Heiducks, Helias Hasky,</HI> and <HI>Turso</HI> under∣took
<PB N="22" REF="13"/> took to go to them, and either to pacifie them, or to proclaim War against them.</P>
<P>Then did the <HI>Archduke</HI> return to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he called an Assembly of the Estates and acquainted them wich what had been done at <HI>Presbourg,</HI> intreating them to provide mony in case the <HI>Heiducks</HI> did not lay down Arms; He also aspired to be King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and to further his designs, he resolved to settle peace, as well with the <HI>Heyducks</HI> as with the <HI>Turk;</HI> and <HI>Hasky</HI> and <HI>Turso</HI> so far prevailed with the <HI>Hyducks</HI> that fifteen Troops of them entred into their pay, and the rest were dispersed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣duke for∣ces the Emperor to make him King of <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE>Presently after did the Archduke raise an Army of twenty Thousand old Souldiers, with which he marched through <HI>Mo∣ravia</HI> into <HI>Bohemia</HI> towards the Emperor, his Brother, who was at <HI>Prague,</HI> and there he enforced him to resign the Crown of <HI>Hungary</HI> to him, and to discharge the <HI>Hungarians</HI> from their Oath, who should choose him King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And accord∣ingly the Crown of <HI>Hungary,</HI> with other marks of Royalty were sent out of <HI>Prague,</HI> and against they came, the Archduke put his Army into Battalia to receive them. There were brought to him the Sword of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> he Golden Ball, the Buskins, the Antique Roab, and the Royal Scepter; the Archduke, attended wich many Noble men, went forth to meet them. All the Ordinance was shot off thrice, and the Souldiers discharged their pieces as oft.</P>
<P>These things being thus dispatched, the Siege before <HI>Prague</HI> was raised, and the Archduke, dividing his Army into three parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He comes back to <HI>Vienna.</HI></NOTE> retired to <HI>Vienna;</HI> and when he came thither, the Inha∣bitants went forth to meet him <HI>July</HI> 14<SUP>th</SUP>, and made him an entry, as to their Soveraign Lord.</P>
<P>At the same time there came to <HI>Vienna</HI> an Ambassador from the <HI>Turk,</HI> sent by the Bassa of <HI>Buda,</HI> for a confirmation of the Peace, before concluded, and with rich Presents, <HI>Octob.</HI> 22. The Archduke parted from <HI>Vienna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes to <HI>Presbourg.</HI></NOTE> and came to <HI>Presbourg,</HI> were he was received with great Pomp by the Noble men of <HI>Hungary</HI> there being ten thousand men at Arms. <HI>Nov.</HI> 6. they presented to him the Articles, conformable to the Edict of Pacification made in the year 1606, whereof you have an account before.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>
<P>These Article being presented to King <HI>Matthias</HI> (for so now we must call him) he confirmed them, and chose <HI>Helias Hasky</HI> Palatine; and then was he Proclaimed King of <HI>Hun∣gary, Novemb.</HI> 14.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Coro∣nation.</NOTE> and upon the 19<SUP>th</SUP> Day he was Annointed and Crowned in S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Martins</HI> Church in <HI>Presburg,</HI> whereof these were the Ceremonies, which I have set down to please the Reader.</P>
<P>The Crown was brought upon a Royal Chariot from the Castle to the Church, with ten Ensigns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ce∣remonies of it.</NOTE> it being in a little Coffer covered with Cloath of Gold, and then put into the Vestry. Four of the Chief Senators, were at the four Corners of the Chariot, and the other Senators and Chief Noble men followed it. The King being attired after the <HI>Hungarian</HI> manner, mounted upon an Horse with a rich Caparison, and accompanied by his Brother, the Archduke, and many other Noble men of divers Nations, came unto the said Church, where having staid a little in the Vestry, two Bishops came to conduct him to the Altar, and before him there went ten Noblemen carrying the ten Ensigns, and five others followed them, whereof the first carried the Cross, the second the Pix, the third the Royal Sword, the fourth the Scepter, and the fifth, which was <HI>Helias Hasky,</HI> the Crown. Cardinal <HI>Fortgasi</HI> did the Office, being assisted by many Bishops and Prelates, who Annointed the King when the Mass began, and set the Crown upon his Head whilst the Gospel was reading, all the People crying with one voice, <HI>God save the King of</HI> Hungary.</P>
<P>Mass being ended, the King took the Royal Sword, which <HI>Colonita,</HI> the Marshal of <HI>Hungary</HI> held, and layd it thrice up∣on the Clergy in the form of a Cross: then received he the Communion at the hands of the said Cardinal: After which they cast a larges of Gold and Silver amongst the People. Which done, the King went by a Gallery from S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Martins</HI> Church to another called the <HI>Deschausses,</HI> where, after they had read the Gospel, he made two and twenty Knights; Then being attired in his Royal Ornaments, and the Crown upon his Head, he went to Horse, and was brought to a bank of Earth, which he leaped thrice over, and then he flourish∣ed his Sword thrice in the air in form of a Cross; which
<PB N="24" REF="14"/> done, he returned to the Castle where the Feast was pre∣pared.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> dis∣charged.</NOTE>The Ceremonies being over, he was forced to deprive the <HI>Germans</HI> of the Dignities, Charges, Estates, and Offices which they held in <HI>Hungary;</HI> and so having pacified the Country, and reduced under his Crown that which the Christians held there, he returned to <HI>Vienna.</HI> Thus in the space of seven Moneths he caused himself to be Crowned King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and to be acknowleged Archduke of <HI>Austria,</HI> and Marquess of <HI>Moravia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Botzkay,</HI> a little before his Death, declared <HI>Valentine Ha∣monnai,</HI> for Prince of <HI>Transylvania;</HI> But the <HI>Transylvanians</HI> (not pleased therewith) chose <HI>Sigismund Rakoczi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rakoczi</HI> Prince of <HI>Transyl∣vania.</HI></NOTE> who was very desirous to have evaded it; but they forced him to <HI>Clausen∣burg,</HI> and made him assume the Principality, the <HI>Turk</HI> also con∣senting and confirming him therein.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>Matthias,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> held a Diet at <HI>Cassovia,</HI> where <HI>Sigismund Rakoczi,</HI> as Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> did him Fealty, and soon after resigned the Principality to <HI>Gabriel Bathori,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He resigns to <HI>Bathori.</HI></NOTE> wherein he shewed his great modesty in de∣clining the Soveraignty, and transfering it to an other, when he was so beloved and honoured by the People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jesuits wicked∣ness.</NOTE>Shortly after (by the instigation of the Jesuites) <HI>Mat∣thias</HI> infringed and invaded the <HI>Hungarians</HI> liberties about their Religion; but the Electors of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and other Prote∣stant Princes arming themselves in their behalf, overruled <HI>Mat∣thias,</HI> whereby they were suffered to live in Peace.</P>
<P>Then did <HI>Radulo,</HI> the <HI>Vayvod</HI> of <HI>Walachia,</HI> refuse Homage to <HI>Bathori,</HI> whereupon he raised a very great Army, and it came to a Battel betwixt them, wherein <HI>Bathori</HI> was totally routed, and forced to fly into the Mountains. <HI>Matthias</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> taking advantage of this his overthrow, seized upon <HI>Clausenburge,</HI> and some other strong Holds that belonged to <HI>Bathori;</HI> yet shortly after, <HI>Bathori</HI> raising a new Army, beat the Kings General out of his Dominions, and forced him to hide himself in the Woods of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> after he had suffered very great extremities: yet <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> was by the Great <HI>Turk</HI> made Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> which so

<P><HI>Ferdinand,</HI> after his Coronation, being excited thereto by the Jesuites, brake the Articles of Peace made with <HI>Botzcai,</HI> and recalled the Jesuites in hatred to the Protestants; Present∣ly after also, the States of <HI>Bohemia</HI> being wronged by him in their liberties both Civil, and Religious,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Frederick,</HI> chosen King of <HI>Bohemia.</HI></NOTE> conferred the King∣dom upon <HI>Frederick,</HI> Prince Elector Palatine, the Issue whereof is so well known to all, that I need say nothing of it.</P>
<P><HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1624. <HI>Ferdinand Ernestus,</HI> the eldest Son of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the second, in his Fathers life time, was Crowned King of <HI>Hungary</HI> at <HI>Ovarum;</HI> and at the same time <HI>Bethlehem Gabor</HI> married <HI>Catherine,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>John Sigismund,</HI> Marquess of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> at <HI>Alba Julia;</HI> and 1626, <HI>Beth∣lem</HI> advanced with an Army into <HI>Hungary</HI> to joyn with Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Saxon Weymar;</HI> but hear∣ing that forty thousand <HI>Tartars,</HI> his Confederates, were slain in <HI>Poland,</HI> he made peace with <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and retreated into <HI>Transylvania,</HI> and not long after dyed;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gabor</HI> dies</NOTE> whereby all the places granted to him in <HI>Hungary,</HI> reverted to the King.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferdinand de Gratz</HI> dies.

The Protestants hereupon had recourse to <HI>Rakoczi,</HI> who was offended with the Emperor upon this account; There was found at <HI>Varadin</HI> in the Vault of <HI>Ladislaus,</HI> and <HI>Sigismund,</HI> some Treasure, together with a Crown, Scepter, and Jewels, one being a Diamond of a vast bigness that shone like a Torch, there being a curse added to any that should presume to meddle with them till some extream necessity should re∣quire it: These <HI>Ferdinand</HI> sent for, and <HI>Rakoczi</HI> refused to deliver them; Another thing that widened the difference was this; Some <HI>Hungarian</HI> Nobles turned Catholicks, and others that were such, got Lordships where the Protestant Reli∣gion was professed, and these took upon them to restrain them from the exercise of their Religion, and took their Churches from them, and placed Priests in them.</P>
<P>These irregularities <HI>Rakoczi</HI> complained of to the Emperor; desiring him to remove them, and to observe those immuni∣ties and priviledges which he, and the Estates had confirmed to the Protestants: and whereas the Emperor had caused three hundred of the Protestant Churches to be shut up, he desired that they might be restored to them: But the Emperor slight∣ed him, and put him off with delays: Hereupon <HI>Rakoczi</HI> pro∣claimed open War against the Emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rakoczi</HI> proclaims War a∣gainst the Emperor.</NOTE> raised an Army of seventy thousand, with which he invaded <HI>Hungary,</HI> publishing a <HI>Manifesto</HI> to justifie his proceedings: He took in divers Ca∣stles, and forced <HI>Cassovia</HI> to a surrender.</P>
<P>To stop his Progress, the Emperor sent an Army of twenty thousand men under Count <HI>Bucaine,</HI> but the <HI>Hungarians</HI> daily falling to <HI>Rakoczi,</HI> the other did little or nothing; In the mean

<P>The right successor of <HI>Rakoczi</HI> was <HI>Remini Janos,</HI> who was owned by many of the <HI>Transylvanians,</HI> but strongly opposed by <HI>Barckay,</HI> and the <HI>Turks.</HI> Yet <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1661, he fought with them at <HI>Thassabat,</HI> and made a great slaughter of them; but at last, being oppressed with numbers, he was for∣ced to leave the Country.</P>
<P>The Emperor perceiving that the <HI>Turks</HI> had a design upon <HI>Hungary,</HI> he raised an Army, sending part of it into <HI>Transyl∣vania,</HI> and at that time Count <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> raised a strong Fort over against <HI>Canisia,</HI> or <HI>Chanischa,</HI> naming it <HI>Serinswar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serinswar</HI> built.</NOTE> which so provoked the <HI>Turk</HI> that he demanded that the Fort should be demolished, that <HI>Serini</HI> should be pu∣nished, and <HI>Transylvania</HI> left to him: This made the Christians to understand his meaning and to look to them∣selves.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre∣parations of the <HI>Turk.</HI></NOTE>In the mean time the <HI>Turk</HI> raised a mighty Army, and pro∣vided an answerable proportion of Victuals, Ammunition, and Artillery; and the Emperor had in <HI>Hungary</HI> an Army of thirty eight thousand <HI>Germans,</HI> whom the <HI>Hungarians</HI> favored not by reason of their difference in Religion, so that by <HI>October,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Em∣perors Ar∣my moul∣ders away</NOTE> through want of accommodations, and by surfeits w<SUP>ch</SUP> they took through immoderate drinking of Wine, &amp; eating of Fruits, it mouldred almost to nothing; and being advanced as far as <HI>Clausenburg</HI> in <HI>Transylvania,</HI> they were distressed for want of Victuals and Forrage, and almost environed with their enemies: About this time <HI>Barckay</HI> fell into disgrace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> who preferred <HI>Apaffi</HI> to be Prince of <HI>Tran∣sylvania;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Apaffi</HI> made Prince of <HI>Transyl∣vania.</HI></NOTE> against whom <HI>Remini Janos</HI> opposed himself with eight thousand men, but he went daily to the worst, and the <HI>Germans</HI> were forced to retreat, which made him betake him∣self to places of more security.</P>
<P>Thus things continued till the year 1663, at which time the <HI>Turks</HI> did not only invade <HI>Transyvania</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> success in <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> but some of the Emperors Hereditary Countries also, &amp; in <HI>July</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> came into <HI>Hungary</HI> with an Army of above an hundred thousand men, at least an hundred great Guns, and all other provisions answerable.

<P>About the same time some <HI>Tartars,</HI> and others, forced away over the River <HI>Wargh,</HI> cutting in pieces such Christians as guar∣ded the pass, and so crossing the Mountains they went into <HI>Moravia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moravia</HI> plunder∣ed, and <HI>Austria.</HI></NOTE> where they plundered, and burnt Towns and Vil∣lages for ten days together, and then they passed into <HI>Austria,</HI> where also they made great spoil, and having laden them∣selves with Booty, they returned to the Camp at <HI>New∣hausel.</HI></P>
<P>Then did the <HI>Vizer,</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> make an attempt upon <HI>Serinswar,</HI> and another upon <HI>Clausenburg,</HI> but at both places they were repulsed:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serini</HI> in∣vades the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> and Count <HI>Serini</HI> in the mean time with an Army of <HI>Croats,</HI> and others, made an incursion into some of the <HI>Turks</HI> countries, where he did them much harm, and at his return was made <HI>Generalissimo</HI> of all the Emperors Forces, then rendevouzed at <HI>Presburg,</HI> under their former General <HI>Mon∣tecuculi:</HI> Towards which place the <HI>Vizier</HI> now advanced, gi∣ving out rumors that he ment to Attaque it. But such had been the care of <HI>Serini</HI> in furnishing of it, himself also being in it, that the <HI>Vizier,</HI> contenting himself with the taking in of some other Towns and places of lesser concernment, he made an Honourable retreat, and presently besieged <HI>Niutra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Niutra</HI> ta∣ken, and other pla∣ces by the <HI>Turk.</HI></NOTE> a very strong City, not far from <HI>Newhausel,</HI> which after a while, was surrendred to him upon Articles: which Victories, and his faithful performance of Covenants, made way for his successes elsewhere: For <HI>Tyrnaw,</HI> and some other Towns opened their Gates to him, upon his promise that they should enjoy their Religion, and Liberties without disturbance.</P>
<P>Then did he besiege <HI>Schinta,</HI> a very strong Fortress, but <HI>October</HI> being almost gone, and Winter coming on apace, he was forced to raise his siege, and to provide Winter Quarters for his Army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Visier</HI> retreats.</NOTE> He left four thousand men in <HI>Newhausel</HI> and fifteen hundred in <HI>Niutra,</HI> besides ten thousand others to be ready upon all emergencies; and to encrease the danger of the Imperialists, <HI>Apaffi,</HI> Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> declared himself an enemy to them, having a promise from the <HI>Great Turk</HI> of the

<P>From thence he marched to <HI>Nevigrad</HI> in Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> which after a stout, but short resistance, was surrendred to him: and though some Regiments were sent by the Emperor to secure the Mine-Towns, yet <HI>Apaffi</HI> took in <HI>Shomnitz, Crem∣nitz,</HI> and some other of them.</P>
<P>The Emperor himself went from <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Regenspurgh,</HI> where he had summoned a <HI>Diet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Diet at <HI>Ratisbone.</HI></NOTE> to consider with the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> how these evils might be prevented, leaving to Govern in his absence, the Archduke <HI>Charles Joseph</HI> his Brother, who, not long after, fell sick and died.</P>

<HEAD>The Description of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> with a Catalogue of the <HI>Vay∣vods,</HI> and Princes thereof.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TRansylvania</HI> is bounded on the East with <HI>Moldavia:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Transylva∣nia</HI> descri∣bed.</NOTE> On the West with the Upper <HI>Hungary:</HI> On the North with <HI>Russia Nigra,</HI> a Province of the King∣dom of <HI>Poland,</HI> from which it is separated by the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains: On the South with <HI>Rascia,</HI> and <HI>Walachia.</HI></P>
<P>It took its name from the great Woods lying betwixt it and <HI>Hungary,</HI> the <HI>Latine</HI> Name signifying the Countrey beyond the Woods. By the <HI>Dutch</HI> it's called <HI>Seber Burgen,</HI> from se∣ven Castles, or strong holds, that were anciently built in it, to defend the Frontiers.</P>
<P>It is environed round about with high Hills and Woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It's strong situation.</NOTE> as
<PB N="34" REF="19"/> with Walls, so that the passages into it are very difficult; by reason also of certain Rivers, and Brooks, amongst which there is the River of <HI>Alutha,</HI> where there is a strong Castle built, called <HI>Roteth,</HI> to defend the passage: And upon the Ri∣ver of <HI>Mariscus,</HI> there is another Fort, called <HI>Brosch.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣modities of it.</NOTE>The soil doth naturally abound with Wines, Corn, and Fruit, of which it yielded such plenty in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> that the Emperor <HI>Trajan</HI> caused a piece of mony to be coined, which had the Figure of <HI>Ceres,</HI> holding in one hand a <HI>Cornu-Copia,</HI> and in the other a plain <HI>Tablet,</HI> with this inscription, <HI>Abundantia Daciae.</HI> The abundance of <HI>Dacia.</HI> More parti∣cularly, besides the great plenty of Wheat, and most excel∣lent Wines, it yields great store of Cherries, Damascens, Mala∣cotoons, Musk-melons, not inferior to those of <HI>Italy.</HI> As also Centaury great store, and many other Medecinal Plants. Some Mines of Gold, and Silver they have, and many more of Iron, Brass, and Copper; and not a few Veins of Salt, and Sulphur. Of Cattle they have such abundance, that many times large Oxen are sold for a <HI>Floren,</HI> or half a Crown a piece. They have also a notable breed of Horses, which are exceeding swift, whose manes hang down to the ground: Not to say any thing of that variety of wild Beasts which they have in their Woods, and Forrests; and of all sorts of Fowl, both for food, and pleasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The qua∣lity of the People.</NOTE>The People are much of the same nature with the <HI>Hunga∣rians,</HI> to whom they have been of a long time subject, but somewhat more stubborn, and untractable; they speak the same Language that the <HI>Hungarians</HI> use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scla∣vonian</HI> language.</NOTE> with some dif∣ference in the <HI>Dialect</HI> onely. They were converted at the same time to the Christian Faith, and have the same forms of Ecclesiastical Government; and the same variety of Religi∣ons. In former times they used to read as the <HI>Jews</HI> do, from the right hand to the left: but of late, they con∣form herein to the Western Nations, from whom they are ge∣nerally descended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Original.</NOTE>It's evident that the People of this Country are the Progeny of the <HI>Saxons</HI> by their <HI>Saxon</HI> Language, yet in part retained: For we find that <HI>Charlemayne,</HI> like a Politick Conquerer, transplant∣ed
<PB N="35" REF="19"/> many of <HI>Saxons</HI> hither, that thereby he might weaken their strength at home, and by them fortifie the Bounds of his Em∣pire. There is also a Story cited by <HI>Verstigan</HI> to confirm it; Which is this,</P>
<P><HI>Halberstade</HI> was beyond credit, troubled with Rats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange story.</NOTE> which a Musician, which they called the <HI>Peed Piper,</HI> undertook for a great Mass of Money to destroy, which they agreed to. Here∣upon he tuned his Pipes, and all the Rats in the Town dancing after him, were drowned in the next River. This done, he ask∣ed his pay, which they denied him; Whereupon he strikes up a new fit of mirth, and all the children, both Males, and Fe∣males in the Town, followed him into the Hill <HI>Hamelen,</HI> which presently closed again. The Parents miss their children, but could never hear news of them (believe it who pleases) till now of late some have found them in <HI>Transylvania.</HI> This marvellous accident is said to have happened <HI>July</HI> 22. <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1376, Since which time, it's said, that the People of <HI>Halberstade</HI> permit not any Drum, Pipe, or other Instrument to be sounded in that street: and they established a Decree that in all writings of Contracts, and Bargains, after the Date of our Lord Christs Nativity, the date also of this their childrens transmigration should be added for the remembrance of it.</P>
<P>But though the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Saxons</HI> make up the main Body of the <HI>Transylvanians,</HI> yet, having been conquered by the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> they have received many of their Colonies amongst them; and in the Northern parts of <HI>Transylvania</HI> there remain still some of the old <HI>Scythians,</HI> whih were plant∣ed there by <HI>Attila.</HI> Out of all these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The po∣pulous∣ness of it.</NOTE> the Body of this Coun∣try is composed so strong and populous that they are able to raise an Army of ninety thousand men; and actually they did Arm six thousand Horse, and twelve thousand Foot for the Battel of <HI>Keresture; Anno Christi</HI> 1596. being more than all <HI>Hungary</HI> sent to that service by two thousand.</P>
<P>Chief Towns in <HI>Transylvania</HI> of the foundation of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>Saxons,</HI> are; 1. <HI>Hermansted,</HI> in <HI>Latine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Towns.</NOTE> <HI>Hermanopolis,</HI> situate on the River <HI>Cibin,</HI> so named from one <HI>Herman,</HI> who was the Founder of it.

<PB N="36" REF="20"/> to <HI>Vienna</HI> for strength or greatness. It's well fortified both by Art, and Nature: for it stands in a Moorish place, so that the access unto it is very difficult. 2. <HI>Cronstad,</HI> called in <HI>Latine Corona,</HI> by some <HI>Brassovia,</HI> by others <HI>Stephanopolis,</HI> which name was given to it by <HI>Stephen</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> who repaired, and beautified it. It's situate on the borders of <HI>Wallachia,</HI> amongst fruitful Mountains. It's adorned with a fair <HI>Library,</HI> a kind of University, and it's the most noted <HI>Empory,</HI> or Mart-Town in all this Country, unto which there is great resort, especially in the time of their publick Fairs, by <HI>Turks, Arabians, Greeks, Armenians, Polanders, Walachians,</HI> and other Nations. 3. <HI>Bistricium,</HI> called by the <HI>Dutch No∣ren:</HI> It receives it's name from the River <HI>Bistrice,</HI> which runs through it; It's so pleasant, and so sweet a Town, that there is no mire or durt to be seen in it at any time, or if there be, the People presently cause the River, by stoping of it, to swell over it's Banks, and so to cleanse the streets. 4. <HI>Mediesus</HI> (called by the <HI>Dutch, Meduish</HI>) so called, <HI>quasi Medius Consessus,</HI> because it's situate in the midst of the Country. It's a Town almost as neat a <HI>Bistrice.</HI> 5. <HI>Segoswaria,</HI> or <HI>Schesburg,</HI> which stands on the declivity of a Hill. 6. <HI>Zabesus,</HI> or <HI>Laiz,</HI> which was onee the chief Town of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> but now it's much de∣cayed. It's situate in a very deep Valley, well fenced with wa∣ters, and those waters full of Fish. 7. <HI>Clausenbourg;</HI> called in <HI>Latine, Claudionopolis</HI> from the Emperor <HI>Claudius</HI> the se∣cond, who re-edified it. At the first, it was a Colony of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> onely; But of late times the <HI>Hungarians</HI> coming in as Strangers, were at last priviledged as Citizens, and inhabit it together with them. The Town is well seated in the midst of a pleasant Plain, encompassed with a hand some wall, and beautified with Elegant buildings. 8. <HI>Alba Julia,</HI> called now <HI>Weisenberg.</HI> It's situate on a simall Brook called <HI>Oratas,</HI> whence it had it's Name. It's built on the side of a Hill neer the River <HI>Maruch,</HI> or <HI>Murse:</HI> It overlooks a large fruitful Plain. It was heretofore a Bishops See, and the ordena∣ry Residence of the Prince, or <HI>Vayvod</HI> of <HI>Transylvania:</HI> but of late it hath been a Garrison of <HI>Hungarian</HI> Souldiers, who held it for the Emperor, as King of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A famous story.</NOTE> About the year 1600, <HI>Ferdinand de Gratz,</HI> who was after∣wards Emperor, was Governour of <HI>Steirmark, Carinthia,</HI> and <HI>Carniola;</HI> He married <HI>Mariana,</HI> the daughter of <HI>William,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> which Lady was such a Jesuited Papist, that she would not enter into the limits of his Dominions until they were purged of Here ie, and Hereticks (as she called them) and till the Liberties granted to those of the <HI>Augustine Confes∣sion</HI> were taken away, which accordingly, the Arch-Duke (by the perswasion of the Jesuits) did abrogate, and by Oath obliged himself to the Pope, that he would severely prose∣cute all the Protestants which were within his Dominions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Papish cruelty, and inhu∣manity.</NOTE> and accordingly he either banished them, or Plundred, and Murthered them, which was prosecuted with such cruelty and inhumanity by his Popish Agents, that they blew up their very Churches with Gun-powder, and raged against the very bones of the Dead, not suffering them to lie quietly in their graves (which are common and allowed to all men) inso∣much as what the <HI>Turks</HI> had spared, was not spared by them. At the demolishing of their Churches in <HI>Gratz,</HI> they digged up the Body of <HI>William Zimmerman,</HI> an eminent Prote∣stant Minister of that place, and threw it into the Ri∣ver <HI>Mur.</HI></P>
<P>Against these outrages the Protestants pleaded the Treaty at <HI>Passaw,</HI> and challenged the Oath and Faith plighted to them by this Arch-Duke himself, by which (in the year 1581) he confirmed his Fathers agreement with the States, during which space of above eighteen years, he had received from them the Summe of nine hundred thousand <HI>Florens</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> is the price of their Liberty of Conscience; yet nothing would prevail to stop his violent proceedings against them.</P>
<P>But <HI>Ferdinands</HI> success was answerable to this Injustice;
<PB N="54" REF="29"/> For about this time he was engaged in the siege of <HI>Canysia,</HI> held by the <HI>Turks,</HI> wherein he was assisted by <HI>Aldobrand,</HI> the Popes Legate, with his <HI>Italian</HI> Forces; and by the advice of <HI>Sigismund,</HI> Count of <HI>Thurne,</HI> there were none suffered to be listed in their Army but <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, lest the pre∣sence of any Protestants should cause the enterprise to miscar∣ry. The Governour of <HI>Canysia</HI> at this time, was <HI>Hasanes,</HI> who with eight hundred men, and as many more from <HI>Zi∣geth,</HI> and <HI>Buda,</HI> that through the negligence of <HI>Orphus Gai∣lonius, Ferdinands</HI> General of the Ordinance, gat into the City, he defended it resolutely. This <HI>Orphus</HI> whilst he was busie in filling the ditches with wood from the adjoyning For∣rest, was shot with a Culverin bullet, and killed. The <HI>Turks</HI> made frequent, and vigorous Sallies wherein they killed many; and though the Emperor <HI>Matthias</HI> sent six thou∣sand men to assist and animate his Cousin, yet was the Siege spun out till Winter came, which with Frosts and Storms, en∣forced them to leave their Station (a thousand Horsemen being frozen to Death in one night:) They were also worn out with Snow, Hunger, Weariness, and Watching in attend∣ing the Active and Inductrious Enemy, so that they were faign with dishonour to raise their Siege, and that in such hast that they left all their Ordinance for a prey to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who presently after their departure, slew all their sick, and wounded Souldiers that they left in their Camp; and thus it pleased God to preserve the Protestants, whom they would not admit into their Army, and the blow fell upon them, who were the Persecutors of them.</P>
