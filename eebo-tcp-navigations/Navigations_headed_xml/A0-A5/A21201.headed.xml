yet y<SUP>•</SUP> ingratitude could not pull from me the affeccion and desire that I had to proffit and doe you good.

<PB REF="27"/>
vnto you, it is to be considered that this Iland first of al Ilādes receiued the light of Christes re∣ligion. For as stories testifie, it was <HI>prima prouinciarum quae amplexaest fidem Christi.</HI> For the Brittōs beīg first inhabitaūtes of this realme (not withstandyng the subiecci∣on of the Emperours, &amp; heathen Princes) dyd receyue Christes fayth from the Apostolike Sea vniuersally, &amp; not in partes as o∣ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">Englande of al Ilan des recey∣ued fyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>te the faith of Chryste.</NOTE> countryes, nor by one &amp; one as clockes encrease their houres by distinction of tymes, but al to∣gether at ones as it were in a moment.

of the Saxons being heathē m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, that they forsoke the darknes of heathen errours, &amp; enbraced the light of Christes religiō. So that within small space Idolatry and heathē supersticion was vtterlye abādoned ī this Ilād. This was a greate prerogatiue of nobilitie, wherof though the benefite be to be ascribed to god: yet the meane occasion of the same came from the Church of Rome. In y<SUP>e</SUP> faithe of whiche churche, we haue euer since continued and consented with the rest of the worlde in vni∣tye of religion. And to shew fur∣ther the feruent deuocion of the inhabitauntes of this Iland to∣wardes the Churche of Rome, We rede y<SUP>•</SUP> diuers Princes in the Saxons time with great trauell and expenses went personally to Rome, as <HI>Offa &amp; Adulpbus</HI> whiche thought it not inough to shew thē

same hath been to reliue vs in all our necessities. Nor I wil not re hearse the manifolde miseries and calamities, that this Realme hath suffred by swaruing from that vnitie.

Of al which matters I can say nomore but suche was the misery of the tyme. And see how farre forth this furie went. For those that liue vnder the Turke, may frely liue after their conscience, and so was it not lawfull here. Yf men examined wel vpon what groundes these Innouations began, they shall well finde, that the rote of thys, as of many other mischieffes, was avarice: And that the lust &amp; Carnal affeccion of one mā con∣founded all lawes, both deuine and humane.

all these deuises &amp; pollicies practised within thys Realme against the church of Rome, they neded not to haue loste you, but that they sought rather as frēdes to reconcile you, then as ene∣mies to enfeaste you.

deuised to disherit hir, and armed power prepared to destroye hir, yet she being a Uirgin, helples, naked and vnarmed, preuailed, &amp; had the victorye ouer tyrauntes, which is not to be ascribed to any pollici of mā, but to the almighty greate goodnes &amp; prouidence of God, to whome the honoure is to be geuen. And therfore it may be sayd: <HI>Da gloriam deo.</HI> For in mannes iudgemente, on her graces parte was nothinge in apparance, but dispayre. And yet for all these practises &amp; deuises of ill mē, here you se hir grace established in hir estate, being your lawful Quene and Gouernes, borne amonge you, whome God hathe appoin∣ted to reigne ouer you, for the re∣stitucion of true religion, and extirpacion of all erroures &amp; sec∣tes.

of religion, as it appereth by hys actes in Germany▪ yet happly by some secret iudgement of god he hath not atchiued the ende, with whom in my iourney hetherwar∣des I had conference touchinge my Legation, whereof when he had vnderstandinge, he shewed great apperaunce of most ernest ioye and gladnes: saying that it reioysed him no les, of there con∣cilemēt of this realme vnto chri∣stian vnitie, then that his sonne was placed by mariage in y<SUP>•</SUP> king dome.

For al power is of God ac∣cordyng to the saying. <HI>Non est potes∣tas nisi adeo.</HI> And therefore I con∣sider that all power being in god yet for the conseruacion of quiet &amp; godly life in the world, he hath deriued that power from aboue into two partes here in earthe:
<PB REF="33"/>
whiche is in the power Imperial<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two po¦wers in earth, the Ecclesias∣ticall po¦wer, and y<SUP>e</SUP> Imperial</NOTE> and ecclesiasticall. And these two powers, as they be seuerall and distinct, so haue they two seueral effectes and operacions. For se∣culer Princes, to whom the Tē∣porall swerde is committed, be ministers of god to execute ven∣geaunce vpon transgressours &amp; ill liuers, and to preserue the wel doers and innocentes from in∣iury and violence. Which power is represented in these two most excellence persons, the king and Quenes Magesties here preesēt who haue this power committed vnto theim Immediatlye from god, wythout any superioure in that behalfe.</P>
<P>The other power is of ministra∣cyon whyche is the power of the keies, and order in the Ecclesias∣tical state, which is by the autho∣ritie of gods word and examples

of the Apostles, and of all olde holy fathers from Christ hitherto attributed and geuen to the Apo∣stolike Sea of Rome, by speciall prerogatiue.

<P>And the moste holy Catholike fayth and true relygion of Christ whyche in Englande hath been thys long tyme behynde the post and in Captiuitie, is now, being delyuered and cummyng home agayne, of all bothe younge and olde, embraced, worshipped &amp; ho∣noured.

and perceauinge theym selues seduced and deceaued by suche meanes, are sory, and do hartlye repent, mynding faithfully from hensforth their fautes to amend. Amongest whome I can no les do (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y very good lorde) thenne numbre my selfe as one. For al∣thoughe I was neuer (praysed by god) associated with any which wer erronious, or suspected to be fautours and defendours of he∣reticall, and sinistrate opinions: but liuinge vnder silence during the two late kinges procedinges haue kept my selfe clere on euery side, Yet neuertheles, as oftē as I haue, &amp; do remēber w<SUP>e</SUP> my selfe how lasciuiously I liued in Eng lād these. xx. yeres, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> most part thereof haue followed the same trade of liberty &amp; voluptuous li∣uing as a great nūbre haue done: where

I myghte haue had endeuoured myselfe in the meane season, to vertuous learning and studye: I can no les doe, then lament▪ and be sory: yea and with all my hart to repente as others doe, Purpo∣singe (by Gods grace) with them to mend my most miserable, and synfull lyfe, and so to continew to my lyues ende.</P>
<P>In whiche doing I with those whiche haue thus offēded, &amp; they with me, may be assured, that our Sauiour Christ according vnto his owne infallible wordes, spo∣ken of one in the name of al sin∣ners, wil haue mercy, pity &amp; com∣passion on vs, saying: <HI>Nolo mortem peccatoris, sed magis ut cōuertatur et uiuat</HI></P>
<P>And thus England, and al we that dwel therein, accoumpt our selues not onely happy, yea and most happy, which from so many
<PB REF="43"/>
outragious stormes of errours, cares, and calamities, are thus called home agayne to the sure hauen and porte of the most holy Catholyke faythe: But also we do beleue with our very hartes, and do confesse with al our mou∣thes, that almighty God of hys deuine prouidēce hath preserued and kept. iii. persons, as lode▪star res and chiefe guydes, for the de∣fending, inbringinge, and resto∣ring of Englande thus to the v∣nitie of Christes churche.</P>
<P>The first is the Quenes ma∣iestie, who being from her infā∣cye a Uirgin, and immaculate from all spottes of heresies: it hath pleased God to defende hir, ayde hir, and saue her frō the hā∣des, power and might of her ene∣mies.

iye, whiche as roaryng Lions would haue deuoured her. The second is my lord Cardinal, who beyng an exile out of hys natiue countreth Englande, these xxi. yeares, for the two causes before mencioned, and in the meane season, so abhorred, so hated, and so detested as no man durst scars ones name him, whō the quenes magestie nowe hath restored to his bloud, and to the honor of his house. And the thirde is my lorde the Bishop of wynchester Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Chaunceller of England, against whom, from tyme to tyme suche sharpe snares haue been layed, and suche ordinaunce leueled, for that he fauored, and wold haue had to his power defended y<SUP>•</SUP> most holy Catholicke fayth that it is a wounder howe he, hathescaped, and speciallye at hys late being in London Toure.</P>
<P><PB REF="44"/>But suche are the woorkes of GOD the author of all good∣nesse, who alwayes when it plea∣seth him plucketh downe and de∣poseth the proude and hyghe minded, and defendeth and exal∣teth the humble, &amp; lowe of Spi∣rite. So that now all Christe ndō as well as Englande, doth con fesse that these forenamed iii. per sons haue been thus, throughe the prouidence of god moste hap ply defended, preserued, and kept frō their enemies hādes, aboue the expectacion and iudgement of all menne, for the restoring of Englande agayne to the vnitie of Christes religion. Whiche (no dout it is) shalbe to the glorye of God, the wealth of Englande, &amp; to the perpetuall peace, loue, and quietnes of this most noble, and hole yle of Britayn.</P>
<P>Other newes I haue none, but
<PB REF="45"/>
those newes, which most Ioiful∣ly reioyseth all Englande, That the Quenes magestie is concea∣ued with Childe whom our Lord long preserue, and send hir high∣nes a gracyous delyueraunce. And also that in Christmasse ho∣lydayes, the Prynce of Piemont arryued in Englande, and short∣ly after hym the prynce of Orēge whiche are very pryncely intrea∣ted with the king and Quenes Magesties. And beecause I thought youre lordeship woulde be somwhat desirous to knowe the stature and shape of this no∣ble prince the kynges magestie of Englande that nowe is, whō you haue not yet sene, I thought it not muche amysse to descrybe hys person by wryting that your mynde may conceaue that which your iye hath not seen. As for the quenes most excellent magesties

person whose person you haue so often tymes sene, I shall not greatly nede to depaīte vnto you: Understande therfore, that tou∣chyng hys highth, I can wel com∣pare<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kiges forme and stature.</NOTE> hym to Iohn Hume my lord of Iedwardes kinsman. Of vi∣sage, he is well fauored, with a brod forhead, &amp; gray iyes, streight nosed, and manly countenaūce. From the forhead to the point of hys chynne, hys face groweth smal: his pace is prīcely, and gate so straight and vpright, as he le∣seth no inche of his higthe, with a yeallowe head, and a yeallowe berde. And thus to conclude, he is so wel proporcioned of bodi, arme legge and euery other Limme to the same, as nature cannot work a more parfite paterne. And as I haue learned, of the age of. xxviii yeares. Whose maiesty I iudge to bee of a stoute stomake, preg∣naunt

witted and of most ientel nature.</P>
<P>I haue also sent your lordship certaine verses and adages writ ten with the hande of the Lorde Henry Stuarde, lorde Dernley, your nephew, which he wrot this tyme twelue moneth: I beinge with him then at Temple New∣some in Yorkshire. And what praise your Lordship may thinke him worthie, for this his toward∣nes in wrighting, beinge yet not fully. ix. yeares of age, The like praise is he worthye (suerlye) in his towardnes in the latin toūge and the frenche, and in sundrye other vertuous qualities: whom also, God and nature hath endu∣ed with a good wit, ientilnes, beutie and fauour. So yf it may please God to lend him long life, he shall proue a witty, vertuous,

And thustrusting that your good Lordship, of your accustomed hu∣manitie and ientilnes, wil accept thys my symple letter in good part, sent vnto you for this newe yeares gyfte, although it be rude and destitute of wit, lerning and eloquence, I most humbly besech the kyng of kynges, and lorde of lordes, long to preserue and kepe youre Reuerende Lordeship in health, wealth, and fortunate fe∣licitie, with a meri and mani new yeares.</P>
