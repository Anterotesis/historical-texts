<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN first His Majesty King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Second, was pleased to make Choice of me for Sur∣veying the Sea-Coast, I then, as in Duty bound (be∣ing a younger Brother) did acquaint you with it, and most humbly laid the Proposals before you; whereupon you were pleased not only to approve of them, but did most bountifully Advance towards the Charge of the WORK, which be∣ing now finished, with all Submission and Gratitude, I assume the boldness to present these Effects of my Seven Years Industry to your Protection and Patronage.</P>
<P>If at any Time there should be made new Discoveries of any Rocks or Shelves, that are not yet known; or that Sands shall change their Situation (as often they do) I shall be ready by your Advice and Commands (by God's Blessing) to make a further Progress in this Survey.</P>
<P>I could heartily wish that it might be so ordered by your Corporation, that all Masters of Ships, both using forreign and home Voyages, might be in∣couraged to bring you in their Journals, and a Person appointed to Inspect them, which would be a great Improvement of Navigation, by imparting their Observations and Discoveries of the true Form and Prospect of the Sea-Caost,
<PB REF="7"/> with all Harbours, Rivers, Bays, Islands, Creeks, Sands, and Rocks, and other dangerous Places, with the Settings and Flowings of Tydes, and Currants, with the Variation of the Compass; by which means, in a few years, we might have much more exact Sea-Charts and Maps; and for want of such a Method, we have lost many Excellent Discoveries, to the unaccountable loss of Navigation.</P>
<P>And that those Persons that make and sell Sea-Charts and Maps, were not allowed to alter them upon the single Report of Mariners, but with your Approbation, by which means our Sea-Charts would be more Correct, and the common Scandal of their badness removed, that God may prosper all your Generous and Charitable Ʋndertakings; which that they may always succeed the greatest Advantage possible of all their Majesties Subjects, is the constant hearty Wish and Prayer of</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER. <HI>To my Fellow Mariners of</HI> GREAT BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HIS most Excellent Majesty King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Second, who was a great Lover of the Noble Art of NAVIGATION, finding that there were no Sea-Charts or Maps of these Kingdoms but what were <HI>Dutch,</HI> and Copies from them, and those very erroneous, his Majesty out of his great Zeal for the better Improvement of Navigation, was pleas'd in the Year 1681. to give me the Command of a Yatch for the making this Survey; in which Service I spent Seven years time.</P>
<P>The Intent of this Survey is only to give Directions to Mariners to Sail alongst the Coast of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and how to carry a Ship into any Harbour, River, Port, Road, Bay, or Creek with safety, and how to avoid all Dangers known.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens, and that too frequently, that when Ships which have made long and dangerous Voyages, and are come home richly Laden, have been shipwrack't on their Native Coast, whereby both Merchants, Owners and Ma∣riners have been impoverish't. All our Neighbours will acknowledge that no Nation abounds more with skilful and experienced Seamen than our own, none meeting a Danger with more Courage or Bravery; none taking more Care, or use more Circumspection to prevent it, or are more laborious to overcome it: But we cannot expect that the Master and Mates of every Ship should be acquainted with all the Coasts and Harbours of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> into which they may be accidentally obliged to Enter. Sometimes it happens, that in long Voyages the Master and the most knowing Men die, and the Ship is brought into sight of Land by those who have skill enough to conduct the Ship at Sea, but are wholly un∣acquainted
<PB REF="8"/> with the Coasts and Harbours, or having but lit∣tle Knowledge, dare not trust to it; in such Cases, and to such Persons, this Survey will serve in the room of a Pilot.</P>
<P>As many Ships are lost by Ignorance and Negligence, as by stress of Weather, so a Master of a Ship hath a very great Charge, and ought to be a sober Man, as well as a skilful Ma∣riner: All helps of Art, Care, and Circumspection are to be used by him, that the Lives of Mariners (the most useful of their Majesties Subjects at this Juncture) and the For∣tunes of honest Merchants under his Care, may be preser∣ved. To supply the Defects of which, I have been Employed by their Majesties Predecessors, and Encouraged by Inge∣nious and Noble Benefactors; and as I have hitherto made it my Business to make those true Figures of our Coasts and Harbours so to serve my Country, I shall not be wanting to give them such Additions and Amendments as I shall find hereafter needful: Wishing you always happy and successful Voyages, and safe Returns, with Prosperity to the Nation and its Forces by Sea and Land, that as we have been hitherto, so we may even be at home Soveraigns of the Seas, and Umpiers of the Differences betwixt our Neighbours abroad, which as it is every good man's Wish, so is it the constant hearty Prayer of</P>

But where you find a Line drawn between two Figures, as in the Margent, which is used no where but at such places as there is not three Fathom at Low-water. As for Example; At the going into <HI>Rye,</HI> as you may see in the Chart, Number 8. there on the Bar you find the Figure 4 above the Line, which sheweth that there is four Fathom at High-water: Then under the Line there is the figure 1, which sheweth that there is but one Fathom at Low-water on a Spring Tide.</ITEM>

<HEAD>Dunginness.</HEAD>
<P>FRom the <HI>South Foreland</HI> to <HI>Dunginness,</HI> the Course South west by south six Leagues. <HI>Dunginness</HI> is a low Beachy-point, on which is a Light-house; this place is very bold, you may keep within nine and ten
<PB N="2" REF="10"/> Fathom of it close by the shoar. There is good Anchoring on the East side with a westerly wind, if the wind be contrary, and that you should turn to windward from <HI>Dover</HI> to the <HI>Ness,</HI> there lieth a Sand called the <HI>Riprap</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Riprap.</NOTE> in the <HI>Midway</HI> between <HI>Dover</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> shoar. The shoalest part of it beareth from <HI>Dover</HI> south, and south by east, and from <HI>Calis</HI> Cliffs west by south. It lyeth in length North east and south west, both ends pointing the <HI>English</HI> Coast in length about four Leagues, but very nar∣row; there is on it at Low-water fifteen foot. There lieth another small Sand be∣tween this and <HI>Dover,</HI> called the <HI>Gunman-Sand,</HI> where is but twelve foot at Low-water, and lieth from the <HI>South Foreland</HI> South about five or six miles, and is not above two miles over; it lieth North east and South west; you have five and six Fa∣them close to it all round, and twenty Fa∣thom between it and the <HI>Riprap.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>Rye.</HEAD>
<P>To the westward of <HI>Dunginness</HI> lieth <HI>Rye</HI> Harbour; it is a Bar-place, but the water riseth three and four Fathom. On the east side, going in, there are two white Beacons on the Beach, which you keep together till you bring the Leadings Marks together, then run in. When you are in the Harbour you will have no less than fifteen and sixteen foot at Low-water, as you may see in the Chart, Number 8. where the going in is so plainly demonstrated, that you need have no other Directions. As you Sail from <HI>Rye</HI> to <HI>Beachy,</HI> keep not near the shoar, when you come thwart of <HI>Pemsey;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pemsey</HI> Shoal.</NOTE> for there lieth a small Stone-bank on which is but eleven and twelve foot at Low-water. The Mark for it is <HI>Beachy</HI> North west, and <HI>Pemsey</HI> Castle North half east.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>Beachy-Head.</HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Dunginness</HI> to <HI>Beachy-Head</HI> the Course is West south west about nine Leagues. <HI>Beachy</HI> is a high steep white Chalk Cliff: To the westward of which lieth the seven white Chalkey Cliffs, called the <HI>Seven Cliffs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven Cliffs.</NOTE> and are very remarkable. Some say there lieth a Shoal right off of <HI>Beachy-Head,</HI> but I could not find it; however, it may be a small Spot, and hard to find, therefore the best way is not to come too near it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>Cuckmore Haven.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Cuckmore Haven</HI> lieth four miles to the westward of <HI>Beachy-Head,</HI> and is a Bar Har∣bour, not having above six foot at Low-water, and thirteen and fourteen at High-water. When you are in, you lie dry at Low-water. This place sometimes by storms is stopt up with the Beach, and by great Land-floods is opened again.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>New-Haven.</HEAD>
<P><HI>New-Haven</HI> is another small Bar-place, and lieth eight or nine miles to the westward of <HI>Beachy,</HI> only fit for small Vessels.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>Shorum.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Shorum</HI> lieth between six and seven Leagues to the westward of <HI>Beachy,</HI> and is a Bar-place; but better than <HI>Cuckmore</HI> and <HI>New-Haven:</HI> The Bar often shifts. There are Beacons to run in by: when you are in, there is nine foot at Low-water. Here are many good Ships built.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>Bright-Hempston.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Bright-Hempston</HI> is a Town that standeth by the Sea-side on a Beach. There are ma∣ny Vessels belong to it, which they heap up with Crabs on the dry Beach. This place lieth four miles to the eastward of <HI>Shorum.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>Arundel.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Arundel</HI> lieth ten Leagues to the west∣ward of <HI>Beachy,</HI> and four short Leagues to the westward of <HI>Shorum,</HI> and is a Tide-Haven: where at High-water and Half-flood Ships go in, keeping the West-side aboard; and being in, may there ride afloat. I might have said more of these Bar-Harbours, but I leave it to Coasters, and do not recommend it to Strangers, they being Harbours of little Trade or Resort.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>East-barrow-heads.</HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Beachy</HI> to the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> the Course is West south west eighteen Leagues. When you Sail from <HI>Beachy</HI> to the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> you must have a great care of the <HI>East-barrow-heads</HI> and the <HI>Owers;</HI> which lye seven Leagues to the Eastward of the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> and four Leagues from the shoar. The <HI>East barrow-head</HI> lieth from <HI>Arundel</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/> south by west four Leagues, on which is but ten foot at Low-water, and is about three miles in length south and north, and about two miles broad east and west. A mile north by east from this Bank lieth ano∣ther shoal called the <HI>Little East-barrow-head,</HI> and is about two miles in length north and south, and a mile broad, having but nine foot at Low-water, and beareth north west from <HI>Chichester</HI> Church-Spire, and two miles to the northward of these lye a small parcel of Rocks, call'd <HI>Kingman-Rocks,</HI> and lye four miles south by west from the going into <HI>Arundel.</HI> You have five Fathom between them and the shoar.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>Owers.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Owers</HI> lye south south east from <HI>Chi∣chester</HI> Spire, and four Leagues from the shoar, and about four long Leagues or five Leagues east from <HI>Bendridge</HI> Point on the <HI>Isle of Wight;</HI> there length is north east and south west, about three Leagues, and about three miles broad in the middle, and narrow at each end, and dry at Low-water. There lieth another shoal on the inside of this, the north end of it dries at Low-water: Be∣tween which and the shoar is another Shoal lying in length as the <HI>Owers</HI> do, called the <HI>Mixens,</HI> and lieth from <HI>Selsey</HI> Point about two miles south. There is a Channel between the <HI>Owers</HI> and the <HI>Mixens,</HI> but it being of no use but to those that are very well ac∣quainted, I will not give any Directions to Sail through them, nor within them. There lye some other Banks within them, which I forbear to speak of them. The only and chief end of my business is to give good Directions how to avoid these shoals, that have proved so fatal to many Ships. There are very good Marks to avoid them, if you keep <HI>Dunnose</HI> west, you run a good brith without them; there is twelve Fathom wa∣ter close to them; keep in eighteen Fathom and you will not be in any danger of them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Ships are lost on the <HI>Ow∣ers.</HI></NOTE> The great reason why so many Ships have fallen in on these Shoals, is the great In∣draught of the Tide setting strong into St. <HI>Helens</HI> eight hours or more; the latter part of the Flood sets into St. <HI>Helens.</HI> My ad∣vice is, That when you are near this place in the night time, or thick weather, to be very careful, and keep your Lead well: In little Wind or Calms you shall be drawn in here to admiration, by the strong In∣draught, which if you find, Anchor in time.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="waymark">
<HEAD>Chichester.</HEAD>
<P>To the eastward of the <HI>Owers</HI> is the going into <HI>Chichester,</HI> and very difficult; therefore I advise none but them that are acquainted to go in there without a Pilot.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="route">
<HEAD>Directions for Sailing into the East end of the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> called St. <HI>Helens.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COming from the Eastward, come no nearer the <HI>Owers</HI> then eighteen Fa∣thom water, and keep the <HI>Culver</HI> Cliff or <HI>Swan</HI> Cliff west north west, which is a high steep white Chalkey Cliff, as you may see in the making of the Lands, Number 35. and is two miles from <HI>Benbridge</HI> Point, which is the eastermost Point of the Island. Being come within a League of the <HI>Swan</HI> Cliff, or thereabouts, then steer in for St. <HI>Helens,</HI> and have a care of the Spit that lieth away to the eastward from <HI>Benbridge</HI> Point; when the <HI>Swan</HI> Cliff is hid behind <HI>Benbridge</HI> Point, then are you within it, as you may see in the Chart, Number 9. you may run over this Spit in five and 6 Fathom water. If you will Anchor in St. <HI>Helens</HI> Road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Helens</HI> Road.</NOTE> bring St. <HI>Helens</HI> Church west south west, and An∣chor in five, six, seven, or eight Fathom water. There is a small <HI>Owsey</HI> Bank in St. <HI>Helens</HI> Bay, which hath but fourteen foot at Low-water on it, and is called the <HI>Warner,</HI> which beareth N. E. from St. <HI>Helens</HI> Church. Being in St. <HI>Helens</HI> Road, and that you would go in for the <HI>Spithead,</HI> you will see a leading Mark, which is <HI>Gilkicker,</HI> a white Tower by the Sea-side and <HI>Stoke</HI>-Church, one in the other; but the best of the Chan∣nel, between the <HI>Horse</HI> and <HI>Nomans</HI> Land, is to keep the said Church just open to the southward of <HI>Gilkicker,</HI> and Anchor at the <HI>Spithead,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spithead.</NOTE> bring the small Village called <HI>Ryde</HI> by the Sea-side on the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> to bear west south west, and <HI>Gilkicker</HI> north west, then you may Anchor in the best of the Road, at the <HI>Spithead,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To An∣chor at the <HI>Spit∣head.</HI></NOTE> which is a very good Road, and clean Ground, where the Royal Navy many times ride. The <HI>Horse</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks for the <HI>Horse.</HI></NOTE> is hard Ground, and in some places not above seven foot water at Low-water; when the great white Patch on <HI>Portsmouth</HI> Down is on south <HI>Sea-Castle,</HI> then are you within it; keep <HI>Portsmouth</HI> Church-steeple on a small Re∣doubt which is like a Dove-house, and standeth on the East-side of <HI>Portsmouth:</HI> these two in one will carry you close by the
<PB N="4" REF="11"/> <HI>Horse</HI> in five and six Fathom water. The eastward part of this great Bank is called the <HI>Dean.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dean.</NOTE> When the Wind-mill on the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> beareth south west by west, then are you abreast the <HI>Buoy of the Horse.</HI></P>

<P>The Thwart-Mark for the Spit of <HI>Nomans Land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nomans Land.</NOTE> is to bring the Wind-mill on the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> between the south west and the south west by west, then will the said Mill be just over a square Field by the Water-side; which said Mill, if you keep sight of it, will carry you clear of <HI>Nomans Land;</HI> but if the Mill is hid by the Land, then will you run aground on the said Spit. This Mark will carry you up into <HI>Cowes</HI> Road: But for Anchoring in <HI>Stoaks-Bay,</HI> going up into <HI>Hamton</HI> water, or to Sail up to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> I refer you to the Chart, which is so plain, that there needs no Directions. If you have occasion to turn from St. <HI>Helens</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whento turn in∣to St. <HI>He∣lens.</HI></NOTE> into the <HI>Spithead,</HI> have a care of <HI>Nomans Land,</HI> which is steep too; you will have twelve Fathom, and next Cast a shoar; but on the <HI>Horse</HI> you may stand into eight or nine Fathom, and turn the Church a little open of each side of <HI>Gilkicker.</HI> There are several other Marks in the Chart, which I refer you to, that I will not mention, as being needless.

<P>Being in <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road, and that you would Sail out of the <HI>Needles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How to Sail out of the <HI>Needles.</HI></NOTE> steer away for <HI>Hurst Castle,</HI> which place is very steep; being past the Castle, steer away for the <HI>Needles,</HI> which are sharp white Rocks; gi∣ving a birth to some Rocks that lye off from the Island side, in the fair way between the Castle and the <HI>Needles,</HI> you must keep close to the <HI>Needles.</HI> The Tyde of Ebb setteth on the <HI>Shingles,</HI> which are hard Stones.

<HEAD>Directions for coming into the <HI>Chan∣nel</HI> between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> called the <HI>English Channel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Marriner having left the vast Ocean, and brought his Ship into Soundings near the Land, amongst Tydes or Streams, his Art now must be laid aside, and Pilottage taken in hand, the nearer the Land, the greater the danger, therefore your care ought to be the more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To be mindful of Tydes and Cour∣ses.</NOTE>Being in Tydes-ways, narrow Channels, Rocks and Sands, I hope the ingenious Ma∣riner will not take it amiss, in recommend∣ing this to your care, your Tydes, Courses, Soundings, and the goodness of your Com∣passes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To be mindful of your Compas∣ses, and how to order them.</NOTE>That you have a great care that no Iron be near the Compass, and that after long Voyages that the Compasses have been much used, they will grow dull, and yet the virtue of the Magnet holding good; but that which causeth the dulness, and the Compass being not quick in traversing, is caused by the Pin's point (on which the Compass stands) being worn blunt, therefore shar∣pen it with a Hone or fine Whet-stone with care and exactness. And this take for a certain Rule, that the light Card-Compas∣ses traverse best in fair weather, and the hea∣vy Card-Compass best in foul weather. I mean by the heavy Card-Compass that which is stiffned with <HI>Muscovy</HI> Glass, and a Plate of Steel which is touch'd by the Loadstone, instead of Steel-wyre, which is in the light ones. The heavy Card-Compasses are in brass Boxes, which are made to open to take the Card out at any time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tydes, with their S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>gs.</NOTE>The next thing that I recommend to your care, is the setting of the Tydes, which al∣tereth the course to the loss of many Ships, especially when you Sail close upon a Wind, then if the Tyde take you on the Weather∣bough, you shall fall much to Leeward of your Expectation; and if the Tyde take you on the Leebough, ir carries you to windward of your Expectation.</P>
<P>Coming out of the Ocean into the Soundings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depth of Water.</NOTE> which you may know by the water being discoloured, your best help is a good Observation of the Latitude. The next Consideration is your Depth of Wa∣ter, with the colour and quality of the Ground.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colour and Qua∣lity of the Ground.</NOTE> But as for the colour and quality of the Ground, I think it very uncertain, as I found by Experience lying becalm'd in the Soundings, when I very often heav'd the Lead, and did find one cast so different from another in quality, and still in the same depth of water, that I would not have any to trust to it; only this is generally obser∣ved, That the Ground to the southward on the <HI>French</HI> Coast is more gruffer, that is, the Sand is bigger or more gravelly, bigger shells and more variety, with a sort of sharp small things called Needles. West south west from <HI>Ʋshant</HI> eight or ten Leagues, you will have seventy four and seventy five Fa∣thom water, and four and five Leagues west from <HI>Ʋshant</HI> sixty eight and seventy Fa∣thom, west north west from <HI>Ʋshant</HI> eight or ten Leagues you will have seventy and se∣venty one Fathom, and four, five, or six Leagues of sixty six and sixty five Fathom.</P>
<P>North west from <HI>Ʋshant</HI> eight or ten Leagues seventy Fathom, and five Leagues north west sixty four and sixty five Fathom; North north west from <HI>Ʋshant</HI> about seven, eight, or ten Leagues, from sixty five to sixty eight Fathom, and four Leagues north north west sixty Fathom. North from <HI>Ʋ∣shant</HI> eight or ten Leagues, sixty four and sixty five; and from three Leagues to five Leagues north you will have sixty Fathom. In these Depths, Bearings, and Distances the Ground is white things like <HI>Hakes-teeth,</HI> and the Ground ruffer then on the <HI>English</HI> Coast. But, as I said before, that the quality of the Ground being so uncertain, I would not have any Persons to give any trust to it.</P>
<P>But on the Coast of <HI>England</HI> the Ground is finer in general; for five, six, and seven Leagues to the southward of <HI>Scilly,</HI> you will have from fifty to sixty Fathom water fine white Sand, with some red and black amongst it, and some times some small shells or pieces of shells, and at other times white Sand only.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The I∣slands of <HI>Scilly</HI> how far seen.</NOTE>Keep in the Latitude of forty nine de∣grees thirty minutes, or forty nine degrees thirty five minutes, or forty nine degrees forty minutes, till you have from sixty to fifty five Fathom water, more or less, as the Tydes may be high; for at <HI>Scilly</HI> and there∣abouts the Tyde riseth above three Fathom at Full and Change. I have seen the <HI>Light∣house</HI> of <HI>Scilly</HI> in the Latitude of forty nine degrees thirty five minutes, at which time the <HI>Light-house</HI> boar north by east about six or seven Leagues off, and at the same time had fifty eight Fathom water, fine Sand with black speckles, and pieces of shells. To the westward of <HI>Scilly</HI> the Ground is fine grey and white Sand, mingled with small black Sand and pieces of shells, and some∣times without black Sand and pieces of shells.</P>
<P>But if you are to the northward of <HI>Scilly</HI> then your Ground will be white Sand, and owsey Sand: when the Islands of <HI>Scilly</HI> bear south about five or six Leagues, you will have fifty three to fifty seven Fathom wa∣ter. You may see the Light of <HI>Scilly</HI> six and seven Leagues in the Night when it is clear weather.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A stream setting nine hours to the north∣ward.</NOTE>Many Ships have fell to the northward (into the <HI>Welch</HI> Channel or the <HI>Severn</HI>) contrary to their expectation; the cause of which is by a Stream setting nine hours from the north west to the north east, and but three hours to the southward: this Stream begins to set to the north west when it is half Ebb at <HI>Scilly,</HI> and endeth in the north east when it is high-water. This Stream beginneth six or seven Leagues to the west∣ward of <HI>Scilly,</HI> and four or five Leagues to to the southward of <HI>Scilly,</HI> and so between <HI>Scilly</HI> and the <HI>Lizard.</HI></P>
<P>Being to the southward of <HI>Scilly</HI> about the Latitude of forty nine degrees thirty minutes, or forty nine degrees thirty five mi∣nutes, or forty nine degrees forty minutes, and having from sixty to fifty five Fathom wa∣ter, you may keep away east in that Latitude, according as you have wind or weather, and in that depth. But when you have sailed about fifteen or twenty Leagues from sixty to fifty five or fifty two Fathom, then if the weather be clear you may steer norther∣ly for to make the Land. The <HI>Lizard</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lizard.</NOTE> North by east, about nine leagues you will have fifty five, fifty six, and fifty seven Fa∣thom water, then will you have pieces of shells of several colours, thin small slatty stones, and no sand; meeting with this Ground you may stand in to the northward into fifty Fathom. Being past the <HI>Lizard,</HI> if you keep without forty Fathom water, you need not fear the <HI>Eddy-stone:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eddy-stone</NOTE> you will have forty Fathom in the stream of the <HI>Eddy-stone;</HI> if you keep in thirty five Fa∣thom then are you within the <HI>Eddy-stone.</HI> There is thirty five Fathom between the <HI>Ramhead</HI> and the <HI>Eddy-stone.</HI></P>
<P>For the knowing of the Land when you see it, I refer you to the several makings of the Land in the sheet, Number 39. And the making of some Lands are put down in the Draughts of the Harbours; as the making of the Land of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> is put into the Draught of <HI>Dartmouth; Foy</HI> and <HI>Falmouth</HI> the like, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Being sure of your being past the <HI>Lizard,</HI> be sure to keep off from the <HI>French</HI> shoar, for fear of the Rocks called the <HI>Gaskets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gaskets.</NOTE> for when you are near them, the Tyde of Flood sets in amongst the Islands of <HI>Garnsey</HI> and <HI>Jersey:</HI> you will have deeper water near these Rocks, and gruffer Ground then on the <HI>English</HI> Coast. You may from the <HI>Start</HI> to <HI>Portland</HI> and the <HI>Wight,</HI> keep between forty and thirty Fathom water, or between thirty five and thirty, according as you go up the Channel.</P>
<P>When you come near the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isle of Wight.</NOTE> have a care of the Indraught that setteth strong both into the <HI>Needles</HI> and St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> as you may see in the Directions for sailing into the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> which hath drawn many Ships into <HI>Freshwater-Bay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Freshwa∣ter-Bay.</NOTE> and others on the <HI>Owers,</HI> which lye to the eastward of the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> as you may see in the Description of the <HI>Owers</HI> and <HI>East-Burrough-Heads;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Owers <HI>and</HI> East-Bur∣rough-heads.</NOTE> for the last half-flood, or the last quarter-flood, and all the Ebb, setteth into St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> which hath caused many Ships to run aground on the <HI>Owers,</HI> which lye to the eastward of the <HI>Isle of Wight.</HI> The De∣scription of which, and how to avoid them, and how to sail from the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> into the <HI>Downs,</HI> you may see in the Directions from the <HI>Downs</HI> to the <HI>Isle of Wight;</HI> only I would have you to observe, that if you stand over on the <HI>French</HI> Coast, that there is a Bank in the <HI>Fair-way</HI> between <HI>Dunginness</HI> and <HI>Bullin-Bay,</HI> which hath but thirteen Fathom on it, which in the Night may cause you to think that you are nearer the shoar than you are.</P>
