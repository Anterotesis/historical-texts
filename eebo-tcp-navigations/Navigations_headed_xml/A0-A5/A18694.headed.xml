<HEAD>A TRVE DISCOVRSE, WHEREIN IS set downe the wonderfull mercy of God, shewed to∣wardes the Christians, on the two and twentie of Iune. 1593. against the Turke, before Syssek in Croatia.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Pon the 14. day of Iune, that Chri∣stian enemie, and Common violator of peace <HI>Hassam Bassa</HI> of <HI>Bossna,</HI> with the rest of his Lordes and souldiers, to the nomber of thyrtie eight thou∣sand and two hundred, surprised the castle and towre of <HI>Trentschina,</HI> som∣times belonging to the Bishopricke of <HI>Agram.</HI></P>
<P>From thence, vppon the 15. following, he marched before <HI>Syssek,</HI> and played vpon it with his artillerie, vntill the eightenth day, with such force, that he ouer∣threw euen to the ground, the towre thereof, and two peeces of ordinance, together with the master gunners which were appointed, for among such field peeces as he there vsed, he had three in chief, which shot bollets of fortie, four and fortie, &amp; fiue and fortie pound weight.</P>
<P>Vpon this the borderers of the Empire, drawen thereunto partly by necessitie, and partly through de∣sire to relieue <HI>Syssek</HI> aforesaid, assembled their forces together ouer against <HI>Agram</HI> as namely <HI>Rupertus</HI> Ba∣ron of <HI>Eckhenberg</HI> generall of the field: <HI>Andrea Awer∣sperg</HI> chief commander in <HI>Croatia: Erdody Baan</HI> Lord of <HI>Carlstat</HI> in <HI>Windismarke,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Graswein,</HI> Co∣ronell of the horsemen of <HI>Styria</HI> and <HI>Carniola,</HI> and <HI>Mel∣chior</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> of <HI>Roderne</HI> Chieftaine of the Ruitters of <HI>Sylesia,</HI> to the number of fiue hundred the <HI>Kopprainitzers</HI> also, and the Estates of <HI>Windismarke</HI> were present likewise: who leauing two hundred footemen for the defence of <HI>Agram,</HI> and two hundred were for the Sconce (made vpon the bridge), marched forwarde in the name of God: &amp; about midnight (being the eightenth of Iune,) came before <HI>Syssek,</HI> to the number of foure thousand fiue hundred men.</P>
<P>Vpon the ninetenth following, the Turks assaulted it: but effectuated nothing, onely they lost some three score Turkes: at which instant, our men behaued themselues manfully.</P>
<P>Vpon the 20. day <HI>Bassa</HI> sent out three hundred men, to see if they could intercept any person, by whom they might be enformed of the state of our Campe: against whom the Baron of <HI>Ecke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berg</HI> made out some foure hundred horses, who presētly put the Turkes to flight, of whom, they slewe some, some other were takē priso∣ners, and brought home about some fortie horse.</P>
<P>Vpon the 21. day, there issued out agayne on th'other side of the water, some foure hundred of the enemy, likewise to learne and harken of our precee∣dings, who were in like manner beaten backe, and for∣ced to retire to their Campe.</P>
<P>Who because they could not passe the water, with conuenient speede, lost many of their companie, <HI>viz:</HI> two shippefulls in the water, which were drowned, at which time our men tooke two enseignes, and one <HI>Agga,</HI> or Coronell, (who had the leading of seuen en∣seignes).</P>
<P>Vpon the two and twentith of Iune, our men mar∣ched
<PB REF="3"/> neere <HI>Syssek</HI> &amp; entred the Islande, against whom, th'enemy presently made head: whose great power and force, when our men had perfectly viewed and ex∣amined, some were of opinion to make a retraitte, e∣steeming it, no point of wisedome to put themselues into such an apparant and manifest daunger. But the Baron of <HI>Eckenberg,</HI> with certaine other of the Lordes and Chiefe Commaunders, were of a contrary aduise, and thought it more conuenient (in Gods name) to try the fortune of the Battaile, especially, because the ne∣cessitie vrged, &amp; they of <HI>Syssek</HI> were not able one howre lōger to endure the siege. Besides, it was to be feared, lest th'enemy, in making their retraicte, would vn∣doubtedly set vpon them. Which aduise allowed and approued of the rest, they put themselues in order of battaile. The enemy did the like. And as <HI>Hassam Bassa</HI> of <HI>Bossna</HI> made head against our men, with some ten thousand horse and more, and was now entred the Is∣land and brought all his Ruitters before <HI>Syssek,</HI> he cau∣sed his Turkish footemen to be placed vpon th'other side of the Riuer (where a bridge was made of shippes) and the greater part of the Armie kept it selfe close in a Troupe.</P>
<P>The fight began about eleuē or twelue of the clock: And the L. <HI>Baan</HI> with his <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and the people of <HI>Windismarke</HI> gaue the first assault: who through the force and multitude of th'enemy, and namely of the <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> who were placed next the riuer, issued out vpon them so forcibly, that they were fayne to retire, who neuerthelesse were rescued and relieued by the Lord <HI>Graffen</HI> of <HI>Monte Kukulle,</HI> and the harquebusi∣ers of <HI>Carniola.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>Vpon th'other side the <HI>Koppreunitzers,</HI> they of <HI>Carle∣stat,</HI> the <HI>Stirians,</HI> and <HI>Carniolans,</HI> to the number of three hundred horse, brake vpon th'enemy: emongst whom was the L. Generall of <HI>Eckenberg,</HI> with the Lordes of <HI>Roderne</HI> and <HI>Silesian</HI> Ruitters, and the Cheefe Com∣maunders of the horse, who likewise made their fight.</P>
<P>Now as sone as the Turkes espied them, and found them by their manner of riding, to be of <HI>Carlstat,</HI> High Almaines, and of the Confines (for they were at the first persuaded, that they had beene, as in times past, but Boures and Pesants) they tooke their flight to∣wardes the Bridge, right ouer against their Leaguer on the other side of the Riuer of <HI>Kulpa:</HI> amongst whom our people brake in with a great fury. As soone as the <HI>Hassam Bassa</HI> espied this he ran in all hast to the Bridge made vpon the Riuer <HI>Kulpa,</HI> hoping there to make his people (who were now in Flight) presently to retourne to the Fight, but all in vaine: for there were about two Ensignes, or fiue hundred Turkes, which had allrea∣dy past the Bridge, vnto the Footemen there, and the rest endeuoured to follow with all their might and maine: who were intercepted by them of <HI>Carlstat</HI> and the <HI>Koppreunitzers,</HI> &amp; forced them to leaue the Bridge: And the Turkes, which were on the other shoare, la∣bored in the meane while to breake down the Bridge, whome our people with their shott forced to retire.</P>
<P>When the Turkes perceiued, that the Bridge was taken from them, they tooke the water, which at that tyme was great, and ranne so still, as if it had bene a standing lake. In which many a stately, worthy and renowned Turke and horse, lost his lyfe; for they no sooner entred it, but were presently drowned.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>Of all these Turkes, very fewe or none escaped the water, by reason of the shot which continually plaid vpon them, all that day and night.</P>
<P><HI>Hassam Bassa</HI> of <HI>Bossna,</HI> him selfe with certayne o∣ther <HI>Beegen, Aggen, Spahyen, Sayen,</HI> also other renow∣ned Turkes, were forced to take the water euen vn∣der <HI>Syssek,</HI> and were there drowned.</P>
<P>The high Almains would not take any Turke pri∣soner, but slewe them all: but they of <HI>Windesmarke,</HI> tooke some and brought them from thence.</P>
<P>The Turkes which were on thother syde of the wa∣ter greatly lamented, and entreated that if their <HI>Bassa</HI> were taken prisoner, they would not touch his life, but rather honorably entertaine him, for their Emperour would assuredly ransome him.</P>
<P>The Turkish Emperoures sisters sonne, called <HI>Me∣hemet Beeg,</HI> stretched forth his hand in the water (cra∣uinge as it were to be relieued) but he was presently slayne with a shott.</P>
<P>The bodyes of <HI>Bassa, Ernot Beeg: Rhustan Beeg: and Mehemet Beeg:</HI> who was cheefe Generall of the Tur∣kish Cauallerie, were taken out of the water, and the said <HI>Mehemet</HI> had his head presently strooke of.</P>
<P>The Almaine footemen, &amp; such as were vnder the conduct and leading of <HI>Ferdinand Werdners,</HI> were not present at this encounter: but were left behinde to guarde th'Artillery: who forced th'ennemie to leaue eight Field peeces vpon carriages (which were vnder the charge of the <HI>Kazianerins,</HI> and taken from vs by th'ennemy <HI>Anno</HI> 33. before <HI>Essek</HI>) and also certaine f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conetes, with thirty shippes of Victual: they tooke spoyle likewise of the whole Campe and riffled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>Thus hath almightie God wonderfully protected the christian soldiers (which in number were nothing comparable to those of the Turkes.</P>
