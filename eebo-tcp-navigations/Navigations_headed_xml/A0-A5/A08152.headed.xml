<HEAD>THE VVONDERFVLL PROCEEDINGS AND progresses of Count <HI>Mansfield in the</HI> PALATINATE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Must needs now remember the returne of the explorators of the Land of <HI>Ca∣naan,</HI> who terrified the people, with a report of Enachims and Giants, yron gates, and high Towers, strong walles, and impregnable Bulwarkes, great Ar∣mies, and formidable Soldiours, onely <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Ioshua</HI> opposed themselues with a contrary discouery of a plentifull Countrey, and large inheritance; for which the people had like to haue stoned them. Thus haue they dealt with the King of <HI>Bo∣hemia,</HI> euer since the losse of <HI>Prague,</HI> and <HI>Spinola's</HI> entring into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> geering and deriding his attempts, as if it were impossible to prosecute any enterprise against the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and withstand the King of Spaines Ar∣mies, with such auxiliary Princes, as depend vpon his So∣ueraignty: whereupon they haue not onely scorned his Election, but taught their tongues a lesson of defamation, and their hands a cunning of deciphering his weakenesse and temerity, in many calumnious Pictures, and scanda∣lous reports, neuer remembring <HI>Ahabs</HI> little cloude, and what an inundation of raine it grew vnto, nor the childrens of <HI>Israell</HI> making of Bricke in the Land of <HI>Goshen,</HI> and what
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>a glorious Nation they came vnto, nor the deridings of <HI>Sanbolet</HI> and <HI>Tobias,</HI> when they re-edified the Temple, and how they preuayled in despight of opposition: nor in a worde, how the Church of God for all the watchings of the Dragon in the Wildernesse, hath beene still delinered like that woman, and flourished in the end for all her hard beginnings, and outragious aduersaries; and why may not time bring foorth the like birth for the happy deliuerance of the Palatinate, and her Master, for all this thicke han∣ging cloud ouer her head, threatning a tempest of vtter destruction, and desolation.</P>
<P>But my meaning is, not to trouble you with repititions, or vnbinde the fardell of tumor, concerning former mat∣ters; wherein you shall finde her garment be-painted with many tongues on the outside, and as many hearts on the inside, to intimate thus much, that men will be talking ac∣cording to the disposition of their hearts: some like Pa∣pists, some like Polliticians, some like irreligious Neuters, some like Hispaniolized instruments, some like true Pro∣testants, and euery one as their fancy induceth: Nay, I will not speake a worde of former preparations, nor how the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> proued so good a Seruitour to the Emperour, that vpon his comming into the Palatinate, the Papists about <HI>Vdenhem,</HI> in the vpper part of the Bishoprick of <HI>Spires,</HI> made a Comedy of the lost King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> as they tearmed him, and vsed many vnseemely speeches a∣gainst him in that Interlude, with such vndecencies, that England it selfe escaped not their scandalous minortiues: but it passed not away with that succesfull jollity as they pretended, for the comming downe of Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> quickly stopped all their mouthes, and quenched the heat of these burning reproches; as for those vnsauory vntruths of making composition of agreement with the Emperour,
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>or Duke of <HI>Bauaria:</HI> there neuer was such a thought, nor motiue, either of reuolt from the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> or re∣conciliation to them, and therefore of him onely and his proceedings, according to the Poet: <HI>Arma virum{que} vno,</HI> I will now speake, and shew you by Gods grace the successe of his affaires, and then iudge your selues what possibility he stands in, and whether fairer dayes may come in the stead of tempestuous weather, yea, I make no question (according to another Poet:)</P>
<Q>Saepe premente Deo fert Deus alter opem.</Q>
<P>The 14 of October 1621. his Excellency, for so we must stile him: or Generall, with his whole Army came out of the vpper Palatinate toward <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>delberg,</HI> being eight Re∣giments of foote, containing 108. Companies, and 56. Cornets of Horse, somewhat weake, and wearyed with long Marches, yet were they 10000. strong by Pole: but hearing of the siege of <HI>Franckendale,</HI> they stayed not long there, as resoluing to raise it, and releeue the Countrey, to which they were the rather animated, because that Gene∣rall <HI>Vere</HI> sent Colonel <HI>Ouertrant</HI> out of <HI>Mainhem,</HI> with fixe Cornets of Horse, foure Demy Cannons, and two Pieces of sixe pound bullets vnto him, who were welcommed ac∣cordingly, and so his Excellency with 2000. in his owne Regiment. Colonell <HI>Mersen</HI> with 1200. Colonell <HI>Wald∣mans Hawsen</HI> with 2000. and part of a new Regiment vnder Colonell <HI>Bandshaw,</HI> being 1000. with foure Pieces more: besides those which Colonell <HI>Ouertrant</HI> brought, marched presently to <HI>Franckendale;</HI> but the Enemy hearing of his approach, disbandied themselues, and left the siege, reti∣ring toward <HI>Wormes:</HI> yet first possessing the Bridge, they had made right ouer against <HI>Steine.</HI></P>
<P>But this was not so couertly done, but they of <HI>Franc∣kendale</HI> had notice of the same, and made a braue Salley,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>wherein the English, whom Generall <HI>Vere</HI> had left in Ga∣rison, there performed their partes like honest men, and worthy Soldiers, for there were forty of the Enemy slaine, an Italian Captaine with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Ensigne taken prisoners, and many others ouertaken in the flight; by which occasion they were freed of the siege, and deliuered from the feare of vtter destruction: For although the Towne was well fortified and had many Bulwarkes and Trenches, which Generall <HI>Vere</HI> before his departure had ouerseene, and pre∣pared: yet were they not so perfected and warrantable, but such an Army, as the Spaniard had of 9000. at least, might in time either batter, or enforce, considering the Garison decayed, and prouision failed: but God was their protec∣tor, and as you haue heard, sent this supply to put new life into their courages, and relieue their distresses.</P>
<P>Now the siege of Franckendale was in this manner; the Enemy taking aduantage of Generall <HI>Veres</HI> retiring to Mainhem, came with 9000. before it, and for foure weekes continually battered the Bulwarks; but by reason he had not taken in any of the Sconses, nor dismantled the prin∣cipall out-works, he could not endamage the Towne it selfe. Nay: when he had valiantly and fortunately got in∣to the Counterscarfe, he was forced out againe with the losse of 100. men, and taught to know, that a stronger arme putteth out the strong man: yet not altogether dis∣heartned, as resolued, that Honour worketh vpon difficult attempts, he obtained a halfe Moone, from whence he was also fiered, and repulsed with the like losse: For when we perceiued, that they were Masters of the same, and in pos∣session of the Trenches, we presently made a Mine, which prospered so well, that we blew them into the ayre: For the Towne hauing a passage at the back of the halfe Moon after the fashion of rauelings, we did the better effect our
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>purpose, though the worke it selfe was quite defaced. There was also another halfe Moone somewhat lesse made vpon the ditches, which likewise the Enemy attempted; but belike hearing of the failing of the former, they de∣sisted, although they had made many brauadoes to assault euen the ditches themselues, wherein they might haue en∣dangered their whole Army: For they were so well de∣fended, that 3000. men could not surprise them, then had they the wall to come to, which must haue endangered them a great deale more: nay, if they had obtained the wall, which must be done with the like losse: there were many Scafferies behind, and a new wall begun to be made, which also would haue much endamaged them: so that by the iudgement of experienced Souldiers, and the successe of that, wherein they had beene engaged, considering they could not bring the Cannon to batter for the out-workes, this Army would questionlesse haue been consumed in ob∣taining this one place, and yet they might haue failed to. For in three weekes they lost 3000. men, and diuers per∣sons of account, besides great Officers and Captaines, whose bodies were embalmed and sent to Stein: but (God be thanked) to preuent our further feare, and vaine suppo∣ses of what might haue beene done on both sides, the com∣ming of Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> preuented all our accounts, and the Enemy departed within foure dayes toward Wormes, so that the Generall came not to Franckendale at all, but presently followed the Enemy to Wormes, and there en∣camped himselfe round about the 18. of October, whether repaired Generall <HI>Vere,</HI> &amp; some English Captaines, hauing leasure to treat of their affaires, &amp; send to Heidelberg, and other places both to comfort &amp; supply them: But the truth is, we determined to set vpon the Enemy at his Bridge, had we not found many inconueniences in the same.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>For as he lay betweene the Rhein and a Marsh, well in∣trenched and insconsed by Stein, wee could not come at him, or if you will, durst not set vpon him, because men were precious vnto vs, and many wants came vpon vs, be∣sides the time of yeere which threatned vs with vnseaso∣nable weather, the Countrey was also forraged, and the warres had looked vpon this flourishing Prouince, with as angry a countenance, as when she threatned to depopu∣late, and destroy a Countrey indeed: For both the Enemy and our selues must be here, and now supplied: Where∣vpon his Excellency about the 22. of October resolued to retire, and dispierce his Army, and so some went to Franc∣kendale: some returned with Generall <HI>Vere</HI> to Mainhem: both the Colonels <HI>Mersen, Bandsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w</HI> went to Heidelberg, and his Excellency himselfe departed to Mainhem, but ta∣ried not long, by reason of many inconueniences: so hee obscured his time, and passed ouer the Bridge into the Bishoprick of Spires, taking all places he came at, and ran∣sacking euery Town, wherein he determined not to recide except Vdenhem: from thence vnderstanding of the slen∣der guard of other places, he deuided his Army, sending some forces to Benshem, some to Heppenhem, and some to Weinhem, all which he quickly surprised, taking the spoile for his Souldiers, &amp; as quickly forsooke, when the Enemy approched, who indeede watched him very narrowly: Yet Colonell <HI>Tilley</HI> passed most industriously to Badenberg, &amp; there made a Bridge ouer the Necker, and raised a Sconse right against Neckerhausen, where he quartred himselfe, as his Excellency had done in other places, to the refreshing of his Souldiers, and enriching his Army.</P>
<P>Till this the Bauarians were at variance with the Spani∣ards, and some vnkindnesse arose about Precedency of places: For the Spanish Generall <HI>Don Cordona</HI> would not
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>giue place to the Bauarians, which Colonell <HI>Tilley</HI> challen∣ged, as lying neerest the Enemy, and skirmishing often with his Excellency, whereupon they fell to blowes, and that at last deuided them assunder: so the Bauarians going ouer Odenwald, tooke Mosbach, and Ederback on the Necker, and also Steinbach, and Schonam, which hee might doe with ease, considering Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> retur∣ned once againe to Mainhem about the 13. of Nouember, and so was this Bishoprick of Spieres tossed as it were be∣tweene two Seas, and ready to be swallowed of either: For both the Armies were needy, and the belly hauing no eares, nor eyes to discerne parties, called for meat, and en∣tertained all that came.</P>
<P>But what with the necessity of his affaires, &amp; the stirring∣nes of his spirit, his Excellency could not rest long in a place, &amp; so the 15 of Nouem went ouer the Bridge againe, taking in Dieteshen, which after 8. Cannon shot yeelded without resistance, wherein Duke <HI>Saxon Lowanbord</HI> stayed with his Regiment. From thence the 16. of Nouember, his Excellency took Keichweild Towne, and a Castle standing in a marsh by composition: for it should seeme both Cap∣taine and Souldiers (though for the most part Subiects of the Bishoprick of Spires) were well addicted to his Excel∣lency, and so yeelded without battery, making intercession to serue him, and so they were entertained, and remained amongst vs, &amp; the rather, because the Enemy was strong in these parts &amp; places, as lodging the chiefe Lieutenant Co∣lonell <HI>Lipp,</HI> vnder <HI>Graue Rheinhart van Solmes,</HI> with his Regi∣ment, and 2000. Horse vnder the <HI>Saxon Lowanbord,</HI> who were all dispiersed, for maintainance in the Countrey, and lay thus vpon aduantage to set forward the seruice.</P>
<P>The 18. of Nouember we marched toward Lunterbord, taking both the Castle and the Towne without resistance.
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>For the Inhabitants hearing of our approach, abandoned their dwellings, except 10. Burgers, and the Secretary of the State, who submitted themselues, and admitted of our preuailing: the rest of the people fled some houre be∣fore we came, whereby we found much Houshold-stuffe, apparell, and linnen; all which fell to the Souldiers, by his Excellencies appointment, who desiring rather money, then to be encombred with such vnportable stuffe, sold that for a Florine, which was worth tenne: for when peace and safe conduct was proclaimed to all, that would returne, and repossesse their houses, many came backe againe and redeemed their furniture at easie rates: so his Excellency made his chiefe quarter here, and grew so strong, that the Townes both of Wormes and Spiers, desired his Protecti∣on, and paid great summes of money, the one was granted, the other receiued; by whose example other Townes con∣discended likewise to contribution: For Landaw and Weisenburg, both rickes Townes; disbursed great sums: Haggenaw paid 5000. ricks dollers, and hath yeelded her selfe with the tender of all seruice, and the supply of his Excellencies wants, especially to send him Prouant and Munition, if he went to Lanterburg, yea all the places and people submitted themselues, and applauded his fidelity and endurances.</P>
<P>Inso much, that from the 18. of Nouember, to the 25. there assembled so great a number of Earles, Barons, Colonels, Captaines, and Gentlemen, besides the wonderfull con∣curse of people, that as it is one way incredible, so is it another way remarkable, that either the person or the cause should thriue so suddainely, and against all expectation: euery man offering his seruice to his Excellency, and euery thing giuing waie to his fortunes, and the successe of his enterprises, <HI>Don Court,</HI> a Baron of Loraine, hath mustred
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>600. Horse: Graue <HI>Cassimire van Lowestein</HI> 1000. Colonell <HI>Carleston</HI> 600. Horse, and to make the Companies com∣pleat both with Foot and Horse, Commissions were gran∣ted about the end of Nouember, to raise 6000. Foot more, whereof the most part are come already: so that in my con∣science, if multitudes of men will performe any exploit, here are men enough to ouer-runne a Kingdome; or if those men they haue may be paid and kept together, here are spi∣rits, that propose great matters to themselues, and as great seruice to their Generall. The Duke of Bulloigne propor∣tioneth 4000. Foot, and 1000. Horse. The Prince of Wit∣tenberg with diuers great States, and other Ricks Townes promise faire, and send his Excellency word, they haue al∣ready 8000. in Armes, and at the Spring will make them vp 15000. for the defence of the Palatinate; and as it should seeme, all the Princes of the Vnion, somewhat ashamed of their former retraction, will reassume new courages, and make a triall of new fortunes: so that by this computation, if we may flatter our selues with the hopes of promises, and coadiutements of men, such as the Romanes were wont to Auxiliary forces, and Presidiary Colonies, the King of Bohemia reckoning his own helps, may presume of 60000. men: but yet farre be it from presumption, because God worketh many times with lesser number greater workes, then either the recouery of the Palatinate, or Kingdome of Bohemia.</P>
<P>To this we may adde that Army which is already vnder the commands of <HI>Iohn George</HI> Marquesse of Iaggendorpe, and the Earle of Thorn, being at the least 16000. strong in Bohemia, and the Prouinces of Silesia and Morauia, for all the threatnings of the Duke of Saxony, and inconstancy of the Citizens of Prague, and why may I not name the Hun∣garians, and Transiluanians vnder <HI>Bethelem Gabor,</HI> who
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>questionlesse will not deale ingenerously with the King of Bohemia, but step in as a sharer in this recouery, and keepe all the contracts in despight of rumour, that will haue him at peace with the Emperour, or at least at truce in this time of his absence from Vienna, as is reported, that he is gone toward Italy about a marriage: But whether it be so or no, such be the Letters, such is the report, and euery man stands gazing on these preparations, as if they were to be∣hold some prodigious comet, falling onely into the scru∣ple of coniecture, what should be the issue of both. For my part I leaue all to the vnsearchable prouidence of God, and returne to the businesse in hand, which turneth me ouer to a new worke.</P>
<P>By the occasion of these warres, and dilacerating the peace and plenty of Countries, this goodly Prouince of the Palatinate had come into the hands of cruell vsurpers, and vnnaturall strangers, who haue respected nothing, but the present time, and supplying of wants, not caring what became of her hereafter, nor how deformed they made her for to welcome her owne parents: For they cut downe her Woods, euen before Franckendale, and other places, to preuent annoyance from the Enemy, who kept in the same as vnder shelter, and from thence made many sallyes vpon the people, and lay as it were in Ambuscado to surprise the Souldiers: they ouer-trampled her Vines, and made the hoofes of their Horses speake cruelly to the rootes: they digged vp her fields for Trenches and Bulwarks: they pul∣led downe their houses round about their Townes to raise rauelings and counterscarps, they oppressed the people, suffering no man to enioy his owne, nor to giue it away to whom they pleased: so that they which before in a manner liued securely without walls, and fortifications, are not now safe within walls, trenches, and the mounting of Can∣nons:
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>and this is the misery of discention, and the rage of Princes, who will not be pacified without mischiefe and reuenge, as is apparant all ouer Bohemia, and those Coun∣tries, where the Enemies haue come in with the sound of hostility: so that if any demand, why Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> be∣ing so strong, so well prouided, and befriended, doth not returne into the Palatinate, and either contriue the rendi∣tion, or prosecute the Enemies expulsion. I answer plainly: 1. The Souldiers loue the spoile better then pay, and so are kept together with the hopes of reward, and enriching themselues. 2. Secondly, the Palatinate being thus for∣raged, will not supply the wants of so great an Army. 3. Thirdly, they must be consumed against fortified tren∣ches and Sconses: For they will not come to a maine bat∣tell except they list. 4. Fourthly, treasure being wasted, he is not sure alwaies to pay them, and it is a rule in Mar∣tiall discipline, not to let the Souldier want, while he lieth in the field. 5. For all his Excellency be thus forward, yet is he subiect to direction, and expecteth more friends. 6. Last of all, to expulse the Spaniard &amp; Bauarian by force out of the Palatinate, must cost a great effusion of blood, and Princes that are good, would spare the liues of their Subiects, yea, of Christian Enemies as much as may be. But to returne where we left.</P>
<P>About the 21. of Nouember, the Enemy approched Dieteshen with 8000. horse and foot, and foure Peeces of Ordnance, notwithstanding Captaine <HI>Banbierg</HI> desisted from opposing or fighting with him, as pretending he had no such Commission, but only to stay for his Excellencies comming, who was resolued to encounter with him in∣deed, but the Enemy taried in no place, but rather retired backe, and so there was no hunting him in a depopulated Countrey. The 25. of Nouemb, his Excellency left Lan∣derberg,
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>leauing but one Company, as a Garison therein, and marched with all his forces toward Gernsham, and the next day toward Dieteshen, with foure Peeces of Ord∣nance of 15. pound bullet, where the Enemy and he skir∣mished: for though they retired about the 22. of Nouemb. yet they still houered here about, and resolued vpon any aduantage or opportunity to besiege the Towne, by which occasion when we found them here, we came to blowes: but their maine forces lay entrenched by a Marsh, and kept the fastnesse, so that we could neither enforce them, nor fight any set battaile: wherefore his Excellency loath to loose time in the euening, retired to Bernshem againe, whereby the Enemy had leasure to besiege Dieteshen, and so with nine dayes battery, and the losse of 200. men, he tooke it by composition, after we (as I said) had skirmished with them the 26. and 27. many times.</P>
<P>The 29. of Nouemb, the Burgomaster <HI>Nonnelts</HI> of Spiers was sent vnto his Excellency with gratification and assu∣rance, that they would take vp 1000. men, and giue them three moneths pay, and so send them well furnished to his Excellency, by which example the Townes of Landaw, Weisenburch, and Hagenaw haue done the like, according to proportion of Inhabitants: but <HI>Strasbourg</HI> hath beat vp the Drums for 4000. with her Villages, who are ready to come vnto vs: so that we encrease daily, and finde the Pro∣testants to their power, willing to supply vs with men, mo∣ney, and munition; whereupon we returned to Dieteshen againe, and repossessed the place, putting the Enemy out, and so left 300. men as a Garison in the same, which was done the 12. of Decemb. we did the like to Fridelshem, but that fell into the Enemies hand, as soone as we departed: For you must know, that these places are neither fortified, nor walled, but as the stronger forces possesse them, and
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>make them seruiceable to their vses.</P>
<P>The 16. of December wee marched from Bernshen to Hagenaw, and so to Wantzenaw by Strasburch, and at last tooke Elsaz-sauoren without any great hurt; but most chiefly we forraged the whole Bishoprick to the supplying our wants, and enriching the Souldiers. For when <HI>Stras∣burg</HI> vnderstood what was done, and that we were going away with the spoiles; they sent vnto vs, and redeemed the same with the disbursing of 200000. Ricks dollers; where∣by our Souldiers full of money and courage, cryed out for the Rhine, and the riuer of Maine: For we now mustered 16000. foot, and 6000. Horse, hauing honest and probable certificate, that the Bauarians and Spaniards were not 14000. and so stood in feare of his Excellencies comming vpon them, which no question he would haue done, like thunder, if they would any manner of way had endured the triall, but they had learnt the tricke of entrenching, and so expected the good houre of supplying their Armies both from Sauoy and Italy.</P>
<P>The 6. of Ianuary Monsieur <HI>Bonni Court,</HI> a Baron of Lo∣raine, came to Hagenaw to his Excellency with 600. horse and the Baron <HI>Bouo</HI> with 4000. foote, so that it should seeme his Excellency is much feared in Loraine: For ma∣ny of his Companies haue already tasted the fruits of the Countrey, and with reciprocall gentlenesse been welcom∣med amongst them, yea, it is certaine, that France her selfe suspects his approch, and the Protestants euery where pray for his successe, and comming amongst them, because it is rumoured, that the King of France hath taken the Sa∣crament to ouer-runne them all.</P>
<P>Thus is the mustring of Souldiers, and taking vp of men on all sides: for as his Excellency encreaseth his Company with the inhabitants of Loraine, who willingly suffer his
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>Muster-masters among them, and hath at least 1000. sub∣iects of Spiers likewise to attend his seruice: so doe the Ba∣uarians &amp; Spaniards seeke daily to augment their troopes, and besides great hopes out of Italy and Sauoy, haue the helpe and assistants of the Catholike Bishops, Princes, Gentlemen, and Townes: so that the Earle <HI>George van Low∣esten</HI> hath taken vp a Regiment of foote, and 600. horse, who all lye in and about Landaw. Colonell <HI>Tilley</HI> quarte∣reth with 500. men by and in Landeburg, &amp; hath his other troopes dispiersed in seuerall places: For some 14. dayes since, he tooke Wimphen, and as we heard many of Hei∣delberg retired themselues to Mainhem, being full of feare, that in the absence of Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> the Bauarians would come backe againe to Heidelberg it selfe, but wee hope it is too strong and well peopled for them, and they dare not as yet leaue the other places wherein they abide, naked and abandoned: besides, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> is not re∣tired so farre, but he can come againe vpon them to pre∣uent further mischiefe: for Captaine <HI>Cheuit</HI> lying in Diels∣berg about the end of December, tooke in a little Towne by the meanes of a playing Petard, and slew many of the Bauarians, spoiling and burning the place: yet did yet be∣long to our Colonell <HI>Landshat,</HI> who is a natiue of that Countrey.</P>
<P>In this manner are all these Countries turmoyled, and the people in Armes, so that his excellency groweth stron∣ger and stronger, and the Palatinate is much comforted, and expecteth a faire recouery: For in Heidelberg lyeth Colonell <HI>Mersen</HI> as Gouernour, and hath foure Compa∣nies in his Regiment; with him is ioyned Colonell <HI>Land∣shat</HI> with foure Companies, and two English Companies, who are well appointed, and the Generall <HI>Vere</HI> is very care∣full and industrious, that the Bauarians take him not at any
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>aduantage; whereupon Franckendale was also newly re∣lieued, so that there are now in it 12. Companies, besides, the Burgers and many hundreds of Pesants, who serue for Pyoners, and to set forward the workes: nay, they are so strong and cheerefull, that they sent a conuoy with diuers Gentlemen, and well appointed Companies of foot to conduct the Palsgraue Corne &amp; Wine out of Attenbergs: Schonauer and Niewhausen hoof, with other places, which belonged to his Royalties, to bring all safe to Francken∣dale: but they of Wormes denied vs passage, and shut their gates, keeping their Sconses against vs, because they pretended a treaty and capitulation with the Bauarians, and either durst not yeeld to our requests, or were indeed disaffected to vs in their hearts: whereupon Generall <HI>Vere</HI> not thinking it meete to endure such neutrality, or giue way to affronts, which might disparage his Honour; sent vs Commission to maleprise all the commodities, and Marchandize, that came from Wormes, and intercept the Wagons of all sorts, that passed and repassed too and from them; whereby we quickly tooke 100. Fats of Wine, much Corne, Horses, and many other commodities, teaching them a better lesson of friendlinesse and constancie: so that euer since they haue agreed, and bound themselues to be more seruiceable, and at that time bought out their Corne and Wine againe at reasonable rates, though with great losse to the Marchant, who in the bargain disbursed 1000. Dollers extraordinary, which were deuided amongst the Souldiers, who brought themselues and that they went for quietly to Franckendale.</P>
<P>After this, we grew bolder and bolder, and made diuers out-roades and in-roades into the Bishoprick of Spiers, where we obtained good booty, and faw the misery of these places, which were preyed vpon on all sides, and
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>made subiect to the vsurpation of strangers, who were not dainty to disrobe her of her best ornaments: For as I said before euen at Franckendale it selfe, we were enforced to cut downe the goodly Woods round about it, and many thousand trees in other places, because they serued only as a shelter for the Spaniards to lye in Ambuscado, and so breake vpon vs vnawares; or if you will lye continually shooting at vs to our great losse and hinderance, without any endemnity to themselues: but now God be thanked it is otherwise, though to the Countries damage and defa∣cing, and we are preparing for to raise out-works, and cast rafts and trenches, which will questionlesse put the Enemy to great losse and trouble to winne, and demolish, before he can come neere our Townes: and in this estate standeth the Palatinate it selfe at this houre, both our selues and the Enemy well fortified in euery place, and resolued, that if they come not to an orderly rendition, it will be now a matter of great difficulty, to put the possessors out of their holds and fortifications, especially if the Souldiers be well paid, and take notice of the Officers care to supply their wants: For although the Countrey be much forraged, yet for money prouision will come on all sides, and the ri∣uers can send downe their Boats and Punts from remoter places, with corne, cattell, wine, and other necessaries, as occasion shall serue.</P>
<P>While we thus busied our selues in the Palatinate, and lay watching one another to preuent the mischiefes, which might be taken vpon aduantages, his Excellency grew stronger and stronger, and had planted himselfe as it were in a new Countrey: whereupon the spirituality of Mentz, and the confines of Loraine, yea some say of Metts like∣wise, desired with one consent a truce for two moneths, ei∣ther expecting reliefe, which I know not from whence it
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>should come, or resoluing to buy out their peace, which is that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> desired, as knowing money to be the very sinewes of his strength, and binding cords to keepe all strongly together, or fearing his forces and protestations: For concerning the one, they saw apparantly, that as the Scriptures said of <HI>Iehu,</HI> he came or marched furiously: so did this Champion of Honor, whirle vp and downe their Countries with violence, and added forces to forces to firme himselfe the stronger. Concerning the other, seeing the Spaniards and Bauarians had led him the way, and taught him a lesson of intrusion, and vsurping another mans right; why should not he doe the like, paying them with their owne money, and prizing the ballances with their owne weights? nay, if they were so ready to rob and spoile the Protestants in the Palatinate? why should not hee be as willing and propence to forrage the Papists, wheresoeuer they recided, or he could finde them. These considerations made the Bishops and other Clergy men suspect their estates, and resolue to compound for their quietnesse: For as I said, they saw no forces ready either to oppose or expell the Mansfildians, as I may call them, nor could indeed coniecture, what would be the successe of these affaires, or whether this glorious Army would march, much lesse in what attempts it might be prospe∣rous. For they saw plainely the Bishoprick of Spiers was spoiled, and that the Towne it selfe had agreed with him, and in a manner promised, not to entertaine any Spanish Catisons, though <HI>Don Cordona</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Tilley</HI> impor∣tuned the same: yet for all this did the Bishop retire with certaine Cornets of Horse to Idenheim, where Monsieur <HI>Tilley</HI> was resident, and his Excellency perceiuing the Pa∣pists onely to temporise, was the vnwillinger to come to any composition with them, but would rather aduenture
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>on the spoile: but at last his resolution was to be contented with so much money ready paid.</P>
<P>You haue heard before, that there was some contro∣uersie betweene the Spaniards and Bauarians about points of honour, or (if you will) tumors of vaine-glory and am∣bition, which now burst out againe: For about the 7. of Ianuary, while the Bauarians were resolued to attempt some places: <HI>Don Cordoua</HI> against all expectation would endure the field no longer, nor hazard his Souldiers in the extremity of Winter, which now came vpon them, and so retired himselfe to Winter his troopes in better lodging; whereby wee had the more leasure to surprise such Mar∣chandize, as passed to and fro the Countrey: yea, his Ex∣cellency commanded the Rhine at Germshem, and had di∣uers Ships and Boats ready either to make a Bridge ouer the same, or to transport his Army and Prouision to such places, as he determined to lodge in: but he went pre∣sently as you heard into the Bishoprick of Mentz, and they of Strasburg gaue liberty to his Captaines to muster men, and take vp SOuldiers in his name, though the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> had sent an Ambassadour to diuers Townes by way of countermaund and prohibition: But alas! Ambas∣sies will doe no good, where men are Masters of the field, and Armies lye ready to prosecute any tyranny contradic∣ted, or in the heat of fury and reuenge: For such was the successe of Earle <HI>Mansfields</HI> affaires, that he tooke vp men in all places, and so went directly to Elsas, a Towne of great expectation: for although some two moneths be∣fore he had possession of the same, as he thought, hauing receiued some Souldiers into the Towne, whereby it was confidently giuen out, that Elsas, or Elsas Saueren was his owne, being a fortified place, subiect to the Archduke <HI>Leo∣paldus,</HI> who is Lord of that Countrey they call <HI>Alsatia,</HI> ly∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>betweene Switzerland and Mentz, arriuing by the Bi∣shoprick of Spiers, and the Palatinate, full of Riuers, and extraordinary commodities, and euery way conuenient for his Excellencies affaires: yet they reuolted againe, and put out all his garisons, standing firme for their owne Lord the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus:</HI> so that much exasperated against them, about the 17. of Ianuary, he sent most part of his Ar∣my either to besiege or surprise it, who in the march tooke all the Bishops Booers, with their Horses and Waggons, and made good booty.</P>
<P>But before I proceed any further, you must consider, that in all your Dutch Currantoes, this word <HI>Elsas</HI> is taken for the whole Countrey of <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> as much as for the Towne it selfe, and therefore may bring confusion to the Reader, that he supposeth sometimes the Country is taken, when it is but the Towne, and the Towne is taken, when he is onely marching in the Countrey. Another error ari∣seth from these Currantoes in confusion of time, by <HI>stilo nouo,</HI> yea by many antidates, and postdates, so that they place that first, which should be last, and that last, which had a passage of former time. Thirdly, that they build too much vpon heare-sayes and reports, and so trusting vnto various opinions, huddle all newes together, because they would be thought to know something. Last of all, your Dutch Letters haue a strange custome of partiality to set out the glory, and renowne of their owne Countrey-men, and scarce to mention either the English, or any other Nation, who are indeed the best Actors in such seruices: As for example, in the discription of the fiege of <HI>Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken∣dale,</HI> not an English-man in any Curranto, or Dutch Let∣ter is named: but onely Captaine <HI>Ouertrant,</HI> and such like, when yet the English deserued better then any Nation. Againe: in the gouernment of Heidelberg, onely the
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>Dutch Gouernour is commended, but the English are sparingly past ouer, with naming of two English Compa∣nies in the Towne: Nay, in the description of Mainhem it selfe, the Generall <HI>Vere</HI> is slightly charactered, when yet by commission from the King of Bohemia, he is the great Commaunder of the whole Countrey; and Count <HI>Mans∣field</HI> himselfe, while he is resident there, must acknowledge his authority. These thinges I thought good to certifie you of by way of transition, that you bee not altogether transported with Dutch newes, and partiality, nor con∣founded with transmutation of time and names, nor af∣frighted with any relation, which shall seeme to darken the glory of these affaires, or the hope of better successe in the Palatinate busines. But to auoyde all doubts, questi∣ons and oppositions, I haue (gentle Reader) for your sake composed this discourse, and in a plaine phrase, that you may rely vpon one truth, and teach your hearts a song of thankesgiuing to the God of truth, and battailes, that hath thus begun to bring matters about, against all expectation: and so to our businesse againe.</P>
<P>In Lotringhem the Spaniards Commissaries, as well as Earle <HI>Mansfields,</HI> met to take vp men, and muster Souldi∣ers, and were very iealous one of another, who should pre∣uaile in their greater numbers, how they sped I cannot tell, but we were pleased in our accounts: For although diuers went to Elnshisem to serue Duke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> with assurance that more would follow: yet we made a strong party, and marched forward with 16. peeces of Ordinance, &amp; leauing 300. men in Germersheim, tooke our way to Lanterbergh, where wee had a great skirmish, and lost some men, not without reciprocall damage to the Enemy: but before we passed from hence, newes came of the Spaniards comming to Germersheim, with resolution to make a ship Bridge
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>there, and that 600. Bauarian Souldiers were gone out vpon booty, whom we watched narrowly to catch in their returne, but we failed at this time, and were crossed againe with a new report, that the Towne of Spiers had entertained 1000. Souldiers to defend the same, as suspec∣ting we might come thither, and take them at some ad∣uantage: and thus were the Catholike Bishops likewise standing on their guards, and neither went abroad without a conuoy, nor slept in their Pallaces without Courts of guard; nay, the alarum went as farre as Cullein, and all places prepared to delend themselues: for the Papists per∣ceiued that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> resolued to draw the warre from the Palatinate, into the Bishops Countries, and were in great feare, that the young Duke of Brunswick with di∣uers Lords, in the behalfe of the King of Bohemia, would make a strong party on the other side of the Rhine, as well as Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had done on this side toward Loraine, and the borders of France.</P>
<P>The 20. of Ianuary, wee tooke in the Towne and free∣dome of Hagenaw, resoluing to quarter our selues there, and so remained quiet a while, till his Excellency resolued to prosecute the fiege of Elsas Saberen more throughly, supposing that, as the Archduke <HI>Deopoldus</HI> kept there his Court of Chancery, he had also beene there in person, but the truth was, he had not long since retired himselfe into the Valtolina. In briefe: after we had disarmed all the Souldiers that were in the Townes, we tooke, spoiled the lewes, and forraged the Countries, as turning our selues round about without any certaine passage forward, or backward. Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> sent Colonell <HI>Ouertrant</HI> as Ge∣nerall of this new Army, with 3000. foot, and 1000. Horse, seauen peeces of Cannon, some Petards, and many Pyo∣ners and Workmen, who seated themselues before the
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>Towne, making large quarters, and yet fortifying them∣selues after the custome of trenched Camps: the first thing they doe, was the summoning the place to the vse of Count <HI>Mansfield;</HI> the next thing they attempted, was the threat∣ning of the same, as farre as demolition, if they did not or∣derly surrender and compound for their quietnesse. They of the Towne demaunded three dayes respite: they of the Campe murmured at the delay, whereupon <HI>Onertrant</HI> sent a messenger to his Excellency to know his resolution; who remembring former grieuances, and exasperated for their first reuolt, sent 1000. men more with a seuere imposition, not to allow them three houres by way of disputing, except they determined at the time prefixed to yeeld indeed: for haue it he would, whatsoeuer it cost him. In the meane while all the Bishopricks were spoiled, and the Papists had not now so great a cause of ioy and triumph, as at the be∣ginning their ostentation shewed.</P>
<P>So that I will be bolde to say, neuer was such an alterati∣on: For though Prague is in possession of the Emperour, who hath wracked his rage vpon such he named Traytors, and the Palatinate is thus sorraged by the Bauarians and our Souldiers. Yet marke what followed, euen in a man∣ner the deuastation of all Germany, and the Papists euery where are set vpon by the Protestants, &amp; our Enemies op∣posed with as great Armies and forces: For how the Duke of Saxony is turmoiled in Silesia, and his owne Countrey is apparant, so that in my conscience he wisheth an end of the Warre. The Hungarians forrage euen Silesia it selfe, and spare none, who haue beene opposite to the King of Bohemia. <HI>Bethelem Gabor</HI> takes it ill, that the Emperour will raise Souldiers out of Poland to disturbe his friends, and so procured the Turke to send a Chause vnto him, to certifie his pleasure of misliking the same; and withall
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>watcheth Morauis, and those parts. Generall <HI>Ieggendorff</HI> followeth <HI>Don Baltaser</HI> at the heeles, and sent word to Count <HI>Mrnsfield,</HI> that if he would returne into Austria, now the Emperour was gone to Inspurg, they would or∣der the matter so to intercept his returning to Vienna. The young Duke of Brunswick hath plaid also his Masters prise against the Bishop of Haluerstat, who hath forsaken his Countrey to looke for shelter in other places: so that the Elector of Montz was compelled to fortifie Amenburg, and put a Bauarian Garison in the same: yea, such is the turmoile of these Countries, that no place is free of of dis∣turbance, nor person assured of his estate: For the Prince ELectors are so iealous of these affaires, that as farre as they durst, they called the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Hess in question, for permitting the Duke of Brunswick to come so farre and peaceably into his Countrey vnrefisted, and sought with∣all: but he neither denied it, nor they durst prosecute the matter. To conclude Prague it selfe, the Emperour ha∣uing banished all the Procostant Ministers, and proclai∣med them Traytors, who shall any way affist them, is ready to muteny, and the Garisons that keepe them in awe, su∣spect one another, and the reuolt of the place, if euer there come an Army before it.</P>
<P>While these things haue their seuerall passages in the remoter places, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> prosecuteth his determi∣nation against Elsas Saueren, and the whole Countrey of the Archduke <HI>Leopaldus,</HI> so that diuers Swiss haue offered him their seruice, and the Archduke is much molested to see such a fire raised against him: whereupon by the Bi∣shop of Strasburgs inticement, he sent three persons of re∣putation by the way of an Ambassie, that if he would leaue the Diocesse of Strasburg, and his Countrey vnmolested, he would restore the Veltolina againe, and make a perfect
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>peace with the Hesuetians. Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> replied, he must haue other composition, ere he desisted what was his owne, or knew he could make his owne, he would keepe vntill the Palatinate were restored, and the Bauarians and Spaniards departed, he would either diuert the Warre to other places, or enrich his Army out of other mens purses: as for the name of peace, it had an ill accent in these times, confidering their owne examples: For what did he any more then was taught him, and could he doe lesse, then set on foot some reuenge. If the Spaniards and Bauarians vn∣der the colour of the Emperours seruice, had set vpon the Palatinate, and Protestants there, the auncient inheritance of a religious Prince, and Elector of the Empire: why might not he for the seruice of the King of Bohemia i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other Countries, who were irreligious Papists, and held those Diabolicall positions of murthering, and deposing of Princes.</P>
<P>This answer was much displeasing to <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> but he saw no remedy. For to adde vnto his discontentment, the Switzers resolued not to admit of his gouernment, and so sent word to the Duke of Millane of the same, who could doe nothing without the King of Spaines resolutions: but they would not tarry his answer, but sought all the meanes they could to free themselues, and assist the Grizons for the recouery of the Valtolina againe: whereupon they certi∣fied Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> of all their affaires, who resolued to follow <HI>Leopoldus</HI> whether soeuer he went, and to presse him to make an end of the Warre, and that intrusion.</P>
<P>In the meane while, the Towne of Elsas is now befieged, and the three dayes they demaunded, expired, so they re∣so lued to fight it out, and sent word to the Castle of He genbart, standing vpon a very high rock, to annoy the Ar∣my as they could, which they did night and day: For the
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>Mansfildians lay within shot, and the Towne thought vp∣on nothing but rescue: but neither did the Artillery doe any great harme to the Army, nor could <HI>Leopoldus</HI> preuent the mischiefe which followed: For about the 27. of Ianua∣ry, the Army gaue a braue affault vpon the Towne, and with diuers batteries, and the losse of 400. men, with two principall Captaines, they tooke the same, as also Mours Menster, where were slaine 300: but in both they found sufficient riches, with 300. Tunne of Wine, and many thousand measures of Corne, but neither spoile, not rapes were committed: For vpon small payments their houses stood with their Houshold-stuffe and Vtensels vnstirred, and none were ransommed, but the honest Papists: For the Abbot and diuers others, were faine to flye, and dispierce themselues into Lotteringhen, and sundry places of secu∣rity: yet could not preuent great disbursements of mony, nor in a manner ransomming themselues: For the Mark∣graue of Tourlack tooke his Excellencies part, and got ma∣ny people and Souldiers to be retained in his Excellencies Army, which was mustred anew, and so he marched backe againe toward Loraine with all the Peeces, which he had at Hagenaw, who were faine to disburse 10000. ricks dol∣lers, to buy out their peace; yea, the Duke of Lottinghem himselfe came to a composition of 100000. ricks dollers, that he would paffe quietly without forraging his domini∣ons, which order he obserueth with all the places, that doe quietly surrender; as for those that oppose against him, ei∣ther Village or Towne he leaueth to the spoile of the Soul∣dier, and when they haue no spoile, he payeth them out of his treasury.</P>
<P>Now you must consider, that how euer Elsas Saueren was taken, yet there was a composition made, and condi∣tions of agreement ratified betweene them for the pay∣ment
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>of 300000. Ricks dollers, which were demanded the first of February, and for want of disbursing, much vnkind∣nesse and threatning followed: yet had they fine dayes lon∣ger respite: in which interim Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> retiring himselfe to Hagenaw, gaue the Army leaue to visite the Countrey, and such places where they might imagine any booty was to be gotten, or Enemy to be met withall: and so about the third of February 9. Cornets of Horfe passed Strasburag Bridge to intercept the Bauarians, who were gone vpon some designe to Swatwood: And vpon the fourth of-February many Companies went out another way, and burned foure of the Bishops Villages, watching the Markets, and taking many Bauarians prisoners, who lye vpon the Countrey; as well as themselues, and take one another at aduantage, as opportunity feiues their turnes. The fift of February the speech was, that the whole Army would rise and march forward to Hemses Heim, Brifac, and Friburg: but hearing that the Bauarians were going to new lodging, they desisted for that time, and did not meane to stirre, till they were assured where the Enemy would dispose of himselfe.</P>
<P>While these things were showne on the Stage of Varie∣ty, and all Christiandome stood looking on to behold, what scenes these seruants of Bellona would act: Letters both of gratification and direction came from the King of Denmark, and all that fauoured the cause of the Palatinate, wherein he had particular intelligence, that the Protestant Princes were resolued vpō an Army of their own, that is to say, to be paid at their owne charges, vnder the commaund of the Earle of Tourlach, and to that purpose <HI>Murterbergh</HI> taketh vp 3000. Foot, and 500. Horse: the Barrons <HI>Messairs de Bounoies,</HI> and <HI>Frandecount,</HI> two Regiments, the <HI>Marc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>graue</HI> of Baden, and Duke <HI>Weymaren</HI> 3000. Foot, and 500. Horse,
<PB N="27" REF="16"/>Duke <HI>Magnus</HI> 1000. foot, and 400. horse, <HI>Hemsteder</HI> 3000 foot, the <HI>Rheien Graf Oue</HI> 500. horse, <HI>Fleckensteine</HI> 600. horse, and <HI>Golstein</HI> 3000. foot, and 400. horse: all which with di∣uers others shall march vnder the standard of the Princes of the Vnion: For although they vnderstand of great pre∣parations from Sauoy, Naples, Millaine, Spaine, Poland, Austria, and the Princes combined vnto the Emperour and his seruice: yet they are assured that the Switzers haue leagued themselues, both Protestants and Papists to cast off the yoke of the Spanish gouernment, and to moue in their owne free Orbes, as they did before: yea, <HI>Leopald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> him∣selfe doth much repine at the Spaniards intrusion into the Valtolina, or any territories of the Grizons for the go∣uernment, did euer belong vnto a younger house of Au∣stria, and one of the Archdukes in former times lost his life about the same, and with much adoe it was obtained.</P>
<P>And thus much of Earle <HI>Mansfields</HI> proceedings, to the 12. of February last, whose comming downe into the Pa∣latinate, besides the running away so fortunately with his owne actions, hath made the passage the casier for Gene∣rall <HI>Veres</HI> care and diligence to fortifie such principall pla∣ces, as lay open before to the daring approches of a strong Enemy, and the fearefull batteries of a Cannon, or other stratagems of Warre: but now Heidelberg with many other Townes are well fortified, the passages haue Scon∣ses: the confines are garrisond, the riuers haue Bridges, which they can take away at their pleasure, and the very Boores, though labouring like Pyoners, returne to their Villages with the reputation of a Souldier: so that in my conscience, if <HI>Spinola</HI> himselfe were now to take possession into this Countrey, he would finde it more difficult, then he did, and whosoeuer may conceit by the same argu∣ment, that therefore the Bauarian and Spaniard, being
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>now fortified, will hardly be compulsed out without ren∣dition, or composition. I answer plainely, I thinke so to: For so I am assured the behalfe of the Bauarians, that they will hardly get any further places of account, then they haue: but if the Warre be diuerted to other Countries, as you saw, how the Romanes dealt with <HI>Anniball,</HI> to draw him to defend Carthage, that had been 17. yeares in Italy, and could not be startled from thence by force, or pollicy, then it may be these intruders will be glad to goe home againe to keepe their Countrey from the cruell Armes of deuastation: or if some thundring troopes come vpon them, with a well disciplined and gouerned Army, then may the stronger arme put out the strong man.</P>
<P>As for their obiection, that would commend the piety of the Enemy, in not ouer-running the Countrey at his first entrance into it. What hath hee done better then Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath done in many Countries? but I will answer more particularly; peraduenture he could not, af∣ter the Noble <HI>Vere</HI> came to intercept his forwardnes: per∣aduenture he was willing to taste of the Grapes and fruits many dayes, and then it had beene folly to haue made an vntimely Vintage, and deuoured all in one day. Perad∣uenture he was loath to goe too farre, for loosing himselfe in a Wood, or hazard his returne when he would, if such came behind him, as would make him leape ouer their Pikes, or peraduenture he had limitation, least by prouing too cruell, he might stop vp the gap of all piety and com∣miseration, if euer the wheele of Fortune would turne a∣bout, and leaue the triumpher himselfe in the hands of compassion, as in all ages and chances of Warre hath hap∣pened, where many a time the Sonne hath beene stabbed for his Fathers cruelty, &amp; the Generall reconciled, by find∣a noble aduersary. But here me thinks I am answered with
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>peremptorinesse, that these Countries haue such mighty aduersaries, that there is no possibility of extenuating their greatnesse, much lesse of bringing them to the barre of a new examination.</P>
<P>Be not too presumptuous, nor runne away so fast with ouer-confidence of any worldly stability: remember rather what <HI>Mordecay</HI> said to <HI>Hester:</HI> That if she did not goe in to the King for the preseruation of her people, God would raise some help another way to bring his purposes to passe: so say I of the Palatinate, when we runne away with an opinion of inuincible Armados, and for euitable Armies: the windes and weather may discipate the one, and very weake opposition, ouerthrow the other. For the God of windes and battailes, hath a trick to humble vs with hard beginnings at the first; that prosperity may be the better welcome, when it is hammered out (as it were) on the Anuill of toile, trauaile, wants, disgrace, contempt, and other fearefull endurances.</P>
