<HEAD>The Continuation of our Weekely NEWES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD><HI>From</HI> Lyons <HI>the</HI> 3. <HI>of</HI> Ianuary, 1631.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>VR King hath sent to <HI>Paris</HI> for his royall Or∣naments, either to hold his <HI>Entre</HI> at <HI>Nancy,</HI> or to visit his Majestie of <HI>Sweden.</HI> Some thinke it is for an Election of a <HI>Roman King.</HI> We thinke therefore his Majestie will not come to <HI>Paris</HI> againe, before he hath quite subdued the Dukedome of <HI>Lorraine.</HI> And it is certaine, that the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and other Ca∣tholique States, make earnest suite for assistance from his Ma∣jestie. And we thinke they will surely obtaine so much of him, that he will intercede with the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to vse no hostilitie against the Catholiques, and if he will be indu∣ced thereunto, we shall in time heare.</P>
<P>They be very busie in <HI>France</HI> in levying of Souldiers, and there be more commanded into <HI>Provence</HI> and <HI>Marselles,</HI> whence it appeareth, that the next Summer there will be some warre in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From <HI>Regensburg</HI> the <HI>4.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>Many people retire themselues from the vpper <HI>Palatinate</HI> hither; for that the Elector of <HI>Saxon</HI> is aboue eight thou∣sand strong about <HI>Eger:</HI> And certaine Commissioners are ar∣rived here, who place divers Souldiers along the river of <HI>Da∣nuby,</HI> and make their Quarters as farre as <HI>Passau,</HI> which the <HI>Bavarian</HI>-Countrymen much dislike. And many vnmarried men are pressed to the warres.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P>In the Land beyond the river of <HI>Ens,</HI> divers Imperiall Com∣panies of foote and horse are alreadie inquartered, and more expected. Wherefore the Boores there are very vnruly, and it is to be feared a Rebellion will arise among them.</P>
<P>Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> is returned from <HI>Amberg</HI> to <HI>Nordlingen,</HI> to gather his Souldiers, to what intent time will declare.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From <HI>Leipsich</HI> the <HI>5.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>Coronell <HI>Bannier</HI> vsed great force before <HI>Magdenburg,</HI> but the besieged defend themselues valiantly, in hope that <HI>Pappenheim</HI> (who already is arrived at <HI>Wolfenbutle</HI> with fif∣teene hundred men, and hath taken out of the Garrisons here and there about eight thousand men) would without fayle relieue them. Hee is marched already with divers Regi∣ments towards <HI>Halberstadt.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore the Duke of <HI>Weymar</HI> his Souldiers about <HI>Er∣ford</HI> doe rise to joyne themselues with Colonell <HI>Bannier.</HI> Also the Duke of <HI>Lunenberg</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Bremen,</HI> ga∣ther their Souldiers together, to ioyne with the sayd <HI>Bannier</HI> to prevent <HI>Pappenheim.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Hamburg</HI> we vnderstand, that thereabout are arri∣ved divers thousands of <HI>Swedes,</HI> who take their quarters a∣bout the river <HI>Elbe,</HI> and dayly expect more, and then will passe ouer the <HI>Elbe</HI> to besiege <HI>Staaden,</HI> and <HI>Boxtehut;</HI> To which purpose the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> hath gathered a great number of men, and the sayd Citties haue beene already de∣manded to surrender themselues. And so they intend to ridd the Bishoprick of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and land about the <HI>Weser,</HI> of the <HI>Imperialists.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Imperialists</HI> are not yet gone out of <HI>Wismar</HI> and <HI>Do∣mitz,</HI> the cause whereof is thought to be, that the Comissio∣ner they sent vnto Collonell <HI>Tieffenbach</HI> concerning their de∣parture is not yet returned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD><HI>From</HI> Franckford <HI>the</HI> 6. <HI>of</HI> Ianuary.</HEAD>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is yet (as we vnderstand) at <HI>Mentz</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> giveth daily audience vnto those Princes, Earles, and Ambas∣sadors that be there with him.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Franckford</HI> haue obtained of the King not onely that they may retaine their old Imperiall priviledges and Iu∣risdiction. But also Proclamations haue beene published by the King, to let all men know, that all and every Merchant of what Religion or Nation soever they be, which desire to traffique thither, may with their Merchandize at the time when the Mart is kept, or whensoever they shall trade thi∣ther, passe and repasse without any molestation. And his Ma∣jestie hath thereupon given especiall charge to the Officers and Souldiers not to hinder the same.</P>
<P>The spirituall Electors are yet levying Souldiers, and thrust themselues into the King of <HI>France</HI> his protection, and espe∣cially since there is a <HI>French</HI> Ambassadour with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who requested that his Majestie would restore vn∣to the spirituall Electors and Princes their Lands againe, and much insisted vpon the alliance betweene his King and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> But it seemes the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> doth not much regard it, and will neverthelesse not too soone re∣store those Countryes againe: And it may happen, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in recompence of his expences will detaine them and others the longer, for the better securitie of the <HI>Pro∣testants.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From <HI>Vienna</HI> the <HI>7.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>The Imperiall Army is now distributed into the hereditary possessions, although many complaints there haue bin made, yet all is referred vnto the Duke of <HI>Friedland;</HI> and most of the new levied Souldiers runne away, especially the <HI>Hunga∣rians,</HI> of which 16. Companies ranne away together at once, and haue done great hurt with pillaging in <HI>Moravia.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From <HI>Leipsich</HI> the <HI>7.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>It is here reported, as if Colonell <HI>Pappenheim</HI> (who is about eight thousand strong) should haue brought into <HI>Magden∣burg</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> an hundred men foote and horse, and aboue three hun∣dred Waggons with provision, but no man will giue credit vnto it, because Colonell <HI>Bannier</HI> lay neere vnto it with di∣verse of his Regiments, and the <HI>Weymarish</HI> Souldiers who being about 6000. lay about <HI>Erford,</HI> marched towards <HI>Fran∣conia,</HI> to joyne themselues with him.</P>
<P>Also the Landgraue of <HI>Hessen</HI> is arrived with his Army a∣bout the <HI>Weser</HI> to follow <HI>Pappenheim,</HI> and therefore it is thought, they will rather bring <HI>Pappenheim</HI> into the middle of them, then that hee should haue succoured <HI>Magden∣burg.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From <HI>Franckford</HI> the <HI>10</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> passed by this way yesterday towards <HI>Hanau</HI> to receiue his Queene (as is said) who is daily there expected, and hath not seene the King in 19. moneths.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Swedes</HI> haue taken <HI>Germersheim, Cronweisen, Speier,</HI> and divers places more, they speake also of <HI>Heydelberg,</HI> but it is not beleeved. The Marshall of the field <HI>Horne</HI> hath blockt vp <HI>Schorndorfe</HI> in the Dukedome of <HI>Wirtemberg:</HI> and the Boores there are in Armes about 8000. strong, to hinder the threatned Invasion of Colonell <HI>Altringer.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Forces are said to lie 7. miles from <HI>Strasburgh</HI> still, and we heare nothing of their marching.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Zaberne</HI> hath fortified himselfe strong∣ly, hath taken the Imperiall Souldiers into pay, that ran out of the Bishopricke of <HI>Mentz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From <HI>Naples,</HI> the <HI>6.</HI> of Ianuary.</HEAD>
<P>Vpon Tuesday morning about one of the clocke, being the 16. of <HI>December,</HI> the Mountaine of <HI>Soma</HI> about 6. miles from <HI>Naples</HI> brake forth into a very strange and marveilous burning, wōderfully astonishing the Inhabitants round about; and continued with great violence for the space of two daies covering, or rather burning the neighboring Townes round about with ashes therof: many both men women &amp; children burned, multitudes leaving their habitations, escaped onely with their liues, fleeing with their children to <HI>Naples</HI> for re∣fuge,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> where indeed those of this Citie haue not wonted to extend their Charitie towards the distressed in such abundant measure. The horses, oxen, sheep, &amp; other annimals left behind them, were all destroyed by the fires extremitie; the which evaporated forth most hideous noyse, much like Thunder, or the noyse of great Ordnance, which we of <HI>Naples</HI> heard as easily as if we had beene close by it. The force of this fire was such, that it sent forth pieces of the Mine weighing aboue an hundred weight two miles distant from the place. I spoke with them that out of curiositie went within 3. miles of the Mount, but such pieces fell neere vnto them, checking their hardinesse, that feare caused their retyre with great astonish∣ment.</P>
<P>But that which hath administred most terror, was the con∣tinuance of Earthquakes ever since the Mount began to burne the most violent were the first two dayes, which happened once in a quarter of an houre, which so far affrighted the <HI>Ne∣apolitants,</HI> that they greatly feared the sinking of the City, or the falling downe of their houses vpon their heads. Many therefore fled out of the City into other remote places, the Viceroy purposing to doe the like was prevented, because not thought fit of the Collaterall. Many through feare sought out vacant places, where they might repose themselues in their clothes in the night season, others building sheds of boards to shelter themselues: for the space of two houres the Levant windes, that is the East, blew the smoake towards the City, which much obscured the ayre, and the streets almost an inch thicke with ashes which came from the Mount: and if the wind had continued, it would haue driven, or caused all the people to haue fled out of the City; but a Ponnent wind that is a West hapned, thanked be God it hath not much annoyed the City, but hath burnt vp a great part of the Country. The ashes I am credibly informed extending to <HI>Burletta,</HI> which is aboue 60. English miles from the place: since the first two dayes the Earthquakes are not so frequent, neither so violent, but do still continue. Evident are the demonstrations of their humiliation. It were incredible to relate the number of their
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> processions, for their great and numberlesse transgressions; and that by the people of every condition, in divers manners. Some by the Viceroy and Nobilitie were performed in most solemne manner; so also by the Cardinall on his bare feete, with other of the Clergie: great quantity of men most grie∣vously whipping themselues vp and downe in token of their humilitie. Many were the men also that in pennitentiall ha∣bits went bare footed in their processions: so in like manner women with their haire hanging loose about their eares; and of these the greatest part were whores, which for number are more then a good many, being estimated to bee aboue 40. thousand (some are of opinion many more) thirty thousand are registred, and pay the <HI>Gabella.</HI> Their processions were day and night, grieveous and dolefull were their cryes in ge∣nerall. By the commaund of the Viceroy all shops were shut in for foure dayes, and every one to devote themselues to fa∣sting, praying, and pious actions: and that if any should be found in the house of a whore, to forfeit 2000. Duckets, and the whore to be whipt about the City, &amp; banished the King∣dome. Men not able to pay the penaltie, to be sent to the Gal∣lies; (as a thing most rare) the whores confesse themselues in great abundance, some retire into Monasteries, many con∣verted, and great hope of reformation expected. In fine the hill is much consumed, and continueth burning, the vent be∣ing much inlarged, and Earthquakes (God be thanked) ceased.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Regooza</HI> the <HI>17.</HI> of December.</HEAD>
<P>The 17. of this present in the morning was found here in <HI>Regooza,</HI> and the Territories thereof, ashes which covered all the ground over halfe an inch thicke, and had a burning-sent, and that day continued darkish, with some small raine, and about two of the clocke in the after-noone began to darken more and more, so that about halfe an houre after two it was as darke as midnight, which made all the people for feare flie into the Churches, where they remained till somewhat past three, for then it began to cleere, and suddenly appeared light againe. As yet we doe not heare whether it hath beene so in other parts hereabouts.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter written at <HI>Sultsbach</HI> the <HI>12.</HI> of <HI>Ianuary.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> arrived yesterday at <HI>Ambeg,</HI> accom∣panied by about 50. horses, hee came thither in his Coach from <HI>Newmarke.</HI> It is said there are following after him 2000. horse. With whom he intends to goe to <HI>Weyden.</HI> wherein there is already a great Garriso n thence to view the conveniency for forming therea∣bout of a Campe, and perhaps to visite the <HI>Saxonian</HI> forces that lye enquartered about <HI>Eger;</HI> To which end this very night the horse that lye hereabout have bin commanded to march towards <HI>Neustadt</HI> neare <HI>Weyden,</HI> to be mustered.</P>
<P>Generall <HI>Gallas,</HI> who doth now command some Im∣periall forces in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> lyeth at this time with his forces about <HI>Plau, Daus, Cladra, Darhaw</HI> and <HI>Heyd</HI> which is but one dayes journey from <HI>Weyden.</HI> There∣fore the <HI>Saxonian</HI> forces have need to be watchfull and ready when these guests shall come to visite them.</P>
<P>Among <HI>Tillyes</HI> forces, that lye in their winter quar∣ters in the Countrey called <HI>Ries</HI> and about <HI>Donawert,</HI> the plague beginnes to be very fierce. But yet we heare they are not so much affrighted thereby as they are onely by the name of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> of whose comming they cannot abide to heare.</P>
<P>The Maiestrate of <HI>VVeyden</HI> having kept in their custodie the keyes of their gates (although they have an Imperiall Garrison with them) have beene forced to deliver the same up unto Collonell <HI>Linloch,</HI> who commands the said garrison; But because it was feared the inhabitants will take it ill and perhaps undertake to beate the said garrison out, the keyes were restored backe againe to the Maiestrate: But to assure the feare∣full garrison, the burgers and inhabitants are this ve∣ry day to deliver up their armes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="report">
<HEAD>From Mentz the last of December.</HEAD>
<P>I forgot in my last to tell you, that there was found in the Castle of <HI>Konigstein</HI> (which as I told you former∣ly
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> was last weeke surrendred to Land-grave <HI>VVilliam</HI> of <HI>Hessen</HI>) such store of all sorts of Victualls, Muniti∣ons &amp; faire brasse pieces of Ordnance. That we cannot marvell enough that the garrison that was in it did de∣liver the same, since they had all manner of provisions of all necessaries both for mans sustenance and recrea∣tion, sufficient store for more then a whole yeare. On Christmas evening there arrived heere to the King, <HI>Palatine Augustus</HI> and Duke <HI>Adolph Frederic</HI> of <HI>Mec∣kelburg.</HI> And there are many other young Princes here Who for the most part take commissions to leavie forces for his said Maiesty. And verily the leavies doe very well goe on (as we understand from many brave and valorous Colonels) and there have also beene late∣ly given speciall Commissions unto some whom I may not as yet name here, to have generall Command over certaine forces this comming spring, at which time his Royall Maiesty hoping to bring into the field (be∣sides the army of the Elector of <HI>Saxen</HI> which is to consist aboue thirty thousand men) at the least three hundred Cornets and five hundred Ensignes, the en∣tertainment wherof you may thinke will amount to an exceeding, yea infinite expense: Seeing the Army which his Maiesty doth at this time maintaine, doth cost about 150. Millions of dollars a yeare.</P>

<HEAD>A letter written at <HI>Prague</HI> the <HI>25.</HI> of Decem∣ber, stil. vet.</HEAD>
<P>I would often haue written unto you, but that I know no letters could passe. Now understanding the posts are againe established, according to the former course, from hence to <HI>Dresden,</HI> I will againe returne to my wonted course and write unto you every week. And to make a beginning, you may be pleased to know,
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> That on the thirteenth of this present Moneth there arrived sevearll troopes of <HI>Crabats</HI> here before the gate called the gate of <HI>Wissenberg</HI> (or white-hill) and intended to surprise or take the Towne by force, whereupon three pieces of Ordnance (which is the to∣ken or warning of the enemies approach) being shot off. The Colonell Commander of the Towne, a Baron of <HI>Hofkirk,</HI> sent out some companies of horse which sell on the enemy, who quickly betooke himselfe to flight, leaving many dead and some prisoners behind them. The next day (the 14.) the enemy arrived a∣gaine in good earnest, having placed behind the Cra∣bats, about 1000. Musquetiers, and about 1000. Dra∣gons to flanke them. There the enemy approaching neare the Towne, found presently ready to receive him. The two Companies of horse of <HI>Arnheyms</HI> his guard, and some other troopes, who had placed some Musquetiers into some low ground. Now the said two horse Companies of <HI>Arnheym</HI> having met with the e∣nemy, turned quickly backe and fled, and the enemy pursuing them eagerly, passe neare the place, where the Musquetiers lying hidden, saluted them so suddenly, that a great many tumbled downe from their horses, and the rest began to flye backe; Whereupon the ene∣my with a reasonable Army appeared on the high ground, and made shew as if he intended to take the Towne by force. Then our forces were brought back into the Towne, and all things prepared for defence. Every one taking his appointed places both in the new Sconces and in the fortifications, and the Governour of the little Towne, being a Count of <HI>Solms</HI> caused two field pieces to be placed upon a high house in a Gar∣den, whereby he did so trouble some troupes of the e∣nemy that came neare; that seeing all was to with∣stand him, he made againe his retreat. Now when we saw that he was turning backe, our horse being ready
<PB N="13" REF="8"/> to fall out upon the enemies Reere, then presently the Iesuites began to ring the bels of their Church. Where∣upon the enemy had a mind to come againe on, but our Ordnance doing great harme amongst him, he wēt quite away; And the Governours and Magistrates ta∣king all possible and speedy paines to know the reason of the Iesuites ringing, they found out that the Iesu∣ites had had an intelligence and conspiracy with the enemy. Whereupon their Colledge being visited, there was found great provision of munition and of Armes, for many hundred men, which were ready to bee used both by the Iesuites themselves and others their friends, who endeavoured to make some troubles and would have made a great uprore, (had the enemy got∣ten one gate or any entry into <HI>Prague</HI>) to favour his designe, and to helpe to kill those within the Towne. Thus God having delivered us, and discovered their treason, there was presently on the very same day pub∣lished a prohibition that no Bell at all should more bee rung in the three Townes of <HI>Prague,</HI> and that none should be suffered to goe out or to come in, untill fur∣ther order.</P>
<P>On the 15. of this, there were put certaine compa∣nies of souldiers, as for Garrison into the two Colled∣ges of the Iesuites in <HI>Prague,</HI> the one whereof is built in the old Towne, and the other in the little Towne.</P>
<P>On the sixeteenth the Magistrates visited the sayd Colledge, and found many warlike provisions and Instruments. Whereupon it was consulted and con∣cluded they should bee sent out of the Towne yet that Evening: And indeed there were already divers Coaches and Waggons ready before their Col∣ledge, for the transport of those irreverend Fa∣thers and Traytors which I saw my selfe. —
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> But it was delayed untill the next morning. And so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>On the 17 very early executed, and all Iesuites sent away, so that now we are rid of that plague. Their Colledge of the little Town is now given unto and in the possession of the Carmelites, who dwelled before in the Dutch Church, given to them soone after the battell of <HI>Prague,</HI> and the Iesuites Colledge of old <HI>Prague</HI> sell to the share of the <HI>Franciscan</HI> Fryers, who are very well content of it.</P>
<P>Thursday last the Lord of <HI>Hofkirch</HI> caused the first Sermon to be preached againe in the Dutch Church of the old Towne, and after Sermon his Lordship and ma∣ny Noblemen, Officers and great multitude of people received the Communion.</P>
<P>The foresaid Count of <HI>Solms,</HI> being a very provident and wise man, caused the yce of the River of <HI>Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>da</HI> to be broken up, that there is no passage neyther for root nor for horse, he hath also caused some Ordnance to be placed upon the White Tower, which he hath caused to be mended, whereby we hope to withstand the enemy, and keepe the Towne.</P>
<P>The Boores are very resolute in the Country, and they discover and search out all such as are affected to∣wards the enemy, some they Dill, some they take Pri∣soners and bring them to be examined. Yesterday they brought a Prisoner who had tyed certaine Letters un∣der his privy parts, which Letters I know not what they contained, but the carrier is to be hangd.</P>
<P>Now we receive newes, that the Imperialists en∣deavouring to take <HI>Brande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> have beene well beaten for their labour by our Garrison that lyes there, con∣sisting onely of three hundred Musquetiers of the yel∣low Regiment.</P>
<P>Thus much for this time, the next Weeke I hope I shall send you yet better newes, but I wish to know whether or no you receive my Letters</P>
