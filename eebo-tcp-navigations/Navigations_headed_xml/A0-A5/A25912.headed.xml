<HEAD>THE FRENCH and SPANISH FLEET Arrived at Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>THe French-men having great and plenary intelligence of the Papists proceedings in <HI>Ireland,</HI> after long debate and private confe¦deracy concerning the same effect, they sent with∣out any intermission of longer time a Herauld of Armes to <HI>Tyrone</HI> (that Arch-rebell in <HI>Ireland</HI> cer∣tifying him, that if they were defective, or had any need of auxiliary assistance, they would instantly conjoyne with unanimity, and defend their party with constant puissance, Whereupon <HI>Tyrone</HI> grati∣ously returned an Answer, that he was much respe∣ctive towards them, and promised the uttermost of their intents, and indeavours to performe the best courtesie for their so gratious a Message con∣cerning the demolition of protestant Religion, and withall beseeched, and earnestly requested them to raise some sudden force, and to send a Navie with great expedition unto them, that they might fully subdue the whole kingdome of <HI>Ireland.</HI> This Em∣bassage being re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned, they (after mature, and seri∣ous
<PB REF="3"/><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>long and conected with a re∣gular aggregation the number of sixe thousand men of Arms to goe speedily into <HI>Ireland,</HI> with 9 ships fully loaden with Armes, Ammunition, and strong fortification for the same purpose and intent. And being thus provided for <HI>Ireland,</HI> they seemed to go on with great alacrity, untill they came to the full ohject of their unanimous expectation: where they were very nobly entertained, and with great favour and affectionate respection. Wherefore they being landed at the Port of <HI>Cavarre</HI> marched on still, un∣till they came beyond the <HI>Territories</HI> of that king∣dome to <HI>Armagh,</HI> where they began a promiscuous rnd tumultuous clamar among the people, slaying, and destroying whomsoever they could meet with, of what sect, degree, or Age soever.</P>
<P>When as they met with the Rebels, they had great and singular congratulation, who immediatly conducted them with great expedition to that fa∣mous, renowned, and honourable City of Dublin, who incontinently besieged the same, and most ty∣rannically assaulted, whensoever they met.</P>
<P>The said Castle of Dublin they intended to take the eighteenth day of December, and without any humane partiality they did put the poore prote∣stants to the intolerable miserie, and deplorable ca∣lamitie.</P>
<P>There was great and unexpected solemnity, tri∣umph, and celebration at the French fleet arrived in
<PB REF="3"/>the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> <HI>Territories</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who came to as∣sist the Rebels in so divellish and diabolicall a de∣signe, and to auxiliate then against the protestants, that professe the true and sincere purity of religi∣on: but I hope in Gods omnipotencie that all their plots will be emolished.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Spanish Fleet arrived in Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>SIR <HI>Patricke Devons</HI> collected a numerous mul∣titude out of <HI>Spaine</HI> to goe into <HI>Ireland,</HI> for the assistance of the said Papists there congregated, and plotting the utter subversion of true Christian religion.</P>
<P>He had under his command five thousand men in Armes, who came in a Navie into <HI>Ireland</HI> to the auxiliation of the rebels.</P>
<P>Where at their arrivall, Tyrone and his confede∣rats joyfully entertained him. The cause of their first commotion, and furious insurrection was this.</P>
<P>The Popes <HI>Nuntio</HI> transported such Newes into <HI>Spaine,</HI> that his supremacie was pleased to supplant the Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> and all their Adherents: and because they were Hereticks.
<PB REF="4"/>Therefore his Primacie wold vouchsafe to depose them all. After this Nuncio's message reported to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> he imposed, and committed all the subsequent to Sir <HI>Patrick Devons</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who immediately by the command of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> went under the conduct of 5000. souldiers, who ar∣riving at the Irish Coast were royally entertained by some of the chiefe of the Rebels.</P>
<P>They seemed to be very inhumane, and withall they tooke a private Oath among themselves, that whatsoever Protestant they should meer, or any inclining to the Protestant Religion, hee or they should be incontinently slaine without any partia∣lity at all, and he or they, or any of them that should deny the same shuld be expel'd as a traytor to their party. Thus they proceeded in their vnchristian and tyrannicall slaughter, putting all to the sword, that they could meet obviously of the Protestant religi∣on and profession.</P>
<P>We see therefore, and may apparently perceive how bloudily these rebels proceed in their cruelty and therefore we ought not to sleepe in the chaires of security, and suffer our poore Brethren to suffer there in great violation, and miserable calamity,</P>
<P>For securitie is the very doore that opens the ve∣ry plaine way to destruction. And I pray God whilst many of us doe thinke our selves safe on the sleeping beds of security, that the enemy doth not cut our throats.</P>
<P>While Esau prolonged the time, Jacob stole away his birth-right: And I pray God, while were
<PB REF="4"/>procraitinate and deferre the time in helping out <HI>Brethren</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that a forreine enemy doe not steale away the renowned Prerogative of this Kingdome, and so consequently it become a con∣quered Nation.</P>
<P>While the men in the holy Gospell slept, the Enemy sowed tares amongst the wheat, and I am sure while we neglect the proper time, many teares of Discord, and schismaticall dissention are sowne amongst us. But I hope that God, who heretofore have alwayes defended, and preserved this King∣dome of his singular mercy, and favourable omni∣potencie, will still defend the same for ever, to the propagation of his Truth and Gospell.</P>
