<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM ORTELL, COSMOGRAPHER TO PHILIP THE SECOND, LATE KING OF SPAINE, written first in Latine by <HI>Francis Sweert</HI> of Antwerpe, his familiar <HI>and louing friend, and now translated into English by</HI> W. B, <HI>as great a louer of his learning and vertues.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He stocke of the ORTELS flourished not long since, and liued in good state and credit at Auspurg in Bayern, (<HI>Augustam vindelicorum,</HI> the Latines called it.) From that family came WILLIAM ORTELL, who about the yere of our Lord 1460 left his natiue country, and seated himselfe in Antwerpe, (at that time one of the famousest Mart-townes of the world) where he did many notable things worthily deseruing great commendation: among which that is most memorable, that of his owne proper cost and charges he caused a goodly crosse of free stone to be set vp without the Emperours gate, in that place where the malefactours are vsually woont to be executed and put to death. Beneath this crosse, at the base or foot of the same, stood Mary and Iohn, and beside them, a little farther off, hung the two theeues; the one vpon the right hand and the other vpon the left, vpon their seuerall gibbets. This <HI>William</HI> died vpon the seuenth day of Ia∣nuary in the yeere of our Lord God 1511, and was buried in the cloisters of the Franciscane Friers in Antwerpe, leauing his sonne LEONARD ORTELL sole Executor, and heire, not only of his goods and substance, but also of his vertues and good qualities: For they report that he was a man so deuout and religious, that it was an hard matter to finde him from his booke, serious meditation on heauenly matters. This <HI>Leonard</HI> maried ANNA HER∣VVAYERS, and by her had issue two daughters, and one some named ABRAHAM, (whose life we heere pur∣pose to describe) borne vpon the second day of Aprill, in the yeere of our Lord God 1527. Hee was euen in his child-hood of singular towardnesse, great capacity and passing quicke conceit, and, that which is very strange in youth, hee was neuer giuen to the reading of any trifles or idle vanities. Wherefore his father purposing to make him a scholar, began first himselfe to instruct him priuatly at home in his owne house in the Latine and Greeke tongues: (For the old man was very learned in both these languages.) But see how these good purposes were soon crossed by the vntimely death of his most louing and kinde father! who departing this life, in the yeere of Christ 1535, left this his sonne to be further informed and taught abroade by strange schoolemasters, whose care and diligence to profit him, whatsoeuer their learning were, was nothing so great and painfull: notwithstanding euen vnder these he made such profit in the Artes and liberall Sciences, that he was not much inferiour to the best of his degree and time: For, as I said before, no vaine pleasure, or trifles, pastimes (which commonly are the ouerthrow of many yongue men) could euer with-draw him from his setled purpose, or alienate his minde from his booke. Yet his greatest delight and commendation consisted in the knowledge of the Mathematicall sciences, which for the most part he studied and practised without an instructor, or teacher, atteining, only by his owne paines and industrie, to the great admiration of others, euen to the vnderstanding of the greatest and deepest mysteries of the same. In the thirtieth yeare of his age, hauing many great matters in his head, and loathing to liue idly at home in his owne natiue country, he began to entertaine a conceipt of trauelling into diuers and sundry forreine parts and countries of the world. To Frankford vpon the Main, by reason of the great Marts or Faires, there held at two seuerall times euery yere, he went very often. In the yeere of our Lord 1575, he went with <HI>Iohn Viuian</HI> of Valence, a Marchant, but a great louer of learning, and <HI>Hierome Scoliers</HI> of Antwerp, to Leige, Trier; Tungren and Mentz: of which iourney and peregrination of theirs, there is at this day a booke of his exstant in print, wherein he hath lear∣nedly described the particulars obserued by them. In the yeere of Christ 1577, with <HI>Immanuël Demetrius</HI> of Ant∣werpe, hee trauelled beyond the Seas, into England and Ireland. Italy, that nource of great wits, that worker of strange woonders, that mother of reuerend antiquities and ancient monuments, hee visited thrise. The third time that he went thither, which was in the yeere 1578, he went in company of <HI>George Houfnayle</HI> of Antwerp, who was so excellent a painter that he was greatly esteemed and beloued of the illustrious princes, <HI>Albert</HI> and <HI>VVilliam,</HI> Dukes of Bayern: of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> Duke of Austrich; yea and of <HI>Rudolphus</HI> himselfe, at that time Emperour of the Germanes. But this his consort, to the great greefe of his friends and such as loued his singular qualities, left his life at Prage in Bohemia, vpon the thirteenth of Ianuary in the yeere of our Lord, 1600. This man was woorthy of longer life, if the Fates would respect men for their great parts and excellent vertues. But so it is, that Death, like as the sythe in Haruest, cutteth downe, without distinction, aswell the yongue as old. There was nothing either in Germanie or in France, that was woorth the seeing, that this our authour had not seene and viewed with a cen∣sorious and iudicious eie. At length, hauing ouercome so many tedious and toilsome trauels, he returned againe to Antwerpe his natiue soile. There and then he began to apply himselfe to benefit succedent ages, to write of
<PB REF="3"/> those countries by him viewed and seene, to set out in Charts and Mappes diuers places both of Sea and Land vn∣knowen to former ages, to describe the tracts and coasts of the East and West, South and North neuer spoken of nor touched by Ptolemey, Pliny, Strabo, Mela or any other historiographer whatsoeuer: and lastly to bend all his forces to the framing of that his THEATER, which now is beheld and read with such admiration and applause of all men: in which worke of his he was so generally well liked and approued of all, that Philip the Second, that renowmed King of Spaine, graced him with the honour and title of <HI>The Kings Cosmographer.</HI> He wrot also his GEOGRAPHICALL TREASVRE, a very learned and pleasant worke, in which the ancient names or appel∣lations, (yea and oft times the new, by which they are now called and knowen at this day,) of Mountaines, Hils, Promontories, Woods, Ilands, Hauens, People, Cities, Townes, Villages, Seas, Baies, Creekes, Straights, Riuers, &amp;c. are at one view instantly to be seene. Moreouer, out of ancient coines, for the benefit and delight of such as are louers and studious of antiquities, he set out The HEADS OF THE GODS AND GODDESSES, which afterward were illustrated with an historicall narration or discourse done by Francis Sweert the yonger. In the yeere of Christ 1596, he set forth THE IMAGE OF THE GOLDEN WORLD, that is, A treatise descri∣bing the life, Maners, Customes, Rites and Religion of the ancient Germans, collected and gathered out of diuers and sundry old writers of both languages. By these his labours and trauels he hath gotten and purchased vnto himselfe an immortall name and credit amongst the learned of all sorts. In company he was of an excellent dis∣creete cariage, passing courteous, merry and pleasant. Such was his singular humanity, that it was strange to see how he did winne and retaine the loue and fauour of all men wheresoeuer he became. His enemies he chose rather to ouercome with kindnesse, or to contemne them then to reuenge himselfe of their malice. He did so much hate vice, euen in his owne kindred, that he rather reuerenced vertue in his enemies and strangers. Vaine questions, and subtill disputations of diuinity, or matters of religion, as dangerous and pernicious, hee did alwaies greatly detest and abhorre. A deepe in-sight and sound iudgment in any kinde of matter, he preferred before glosing elo∣quence and quaint termes. Present aduersity and daungers he alwaies endured with more patience then feare of such as were comming on and neere at hand: and those which were bitter, more easily then such as were doubtfull and vncertaine of euent. He was a man which in his life time did set as little by himselfe as any man could: For he neuer set his minde much vpon the wealth of this world, or ought of those things in the same, hauing alwaies in memory that his learned poesie CONTEMNO ET ORNO, MENTE, MANV, <HI>I scorne and trimme, with minde, with hand.</HI> For surely this man was led with some heauenly spirit, which did so with-draw his minde from those earthly cogitations, that he neuer tooke any thing in his life more vnkindly then when he was drawne from his bookes, which he alwaies preferred before all other things in the world beside. These great learned men follow∣ing were his familiar friends, and such as he did greatly loue and reuerence. In Spain <HI>Benedictus Arias Montanus,</HI> that great linguist and graue Diuine; and the reuerend father <HI>Andrew Schotte,</HI> borne in Antwerp, a learned Iesuite. In Italy, <HI>Fuluius Vrsinus, Franciscus Superantius,</HI> and <HI>Iohannes Sambucus.</HI> In Germany, <HI>Gerard Mercator,</HI> that famous Cos∣mographer, <HI>Iames Monaw, Marke Velser, Ioachim Chamberlin, Ionas Grutterus</HI> of Antwerp, and <HI>Arnold Milius.</HI> In France, <HI>Petrus Pithoeus,</HI> and others. In the Low-countries, <HI>Iustus Lipsius, Laeuinus Tormencius, Nicolaus Rockoxius, Cornelius Pru∣nius, Balthasar Robianus, Ludouicus Perezius, Iohannes Brantius</HI> a ciuillian, recorder to the state of Antwerp, <HI>Iohannes Bo∣chius,</HI> secretarie to the same city, <HI>Francis Raphalengius, Christopher Plantine, Iohn Moret, Philip Gally, Otho Venius</HI> that famous painter, and <HI>Francis Sweert</HI> the yonger. In England, <HI>Humfrey Lloyd,</HI> the only learned courtiour of his time, and <HI>VVil∣liam Camden,</HI> now Clarenceux, the painfull and iudicious antiquary of our land. With all these and many other he was familiarly acquainted. To these he wrot often, and from these he often receiued most kinde and louing let∣ters. He was a great student of antiquities, and searcher out of rare and ancient things. He had at home in his house, Images, Statues, Coines of Gold, Siluer and copper both of the Greeks, Romans and others: Shelfishes brought from India and our Antipodes: Marble of all kinde of colours: Torteises shelles of such wonderfull big∣nesse, that tenne men, sitting round in a circle, might eate meat out of them at once: Others againe so little and narrow, that they were skarce so bigge as a pinnes head. His Library was so maruellously well stored with all sort of Bookes, that his house might iustly haue beene termed, A shoppe of all manner of good learning, vnto which men flocked from diuers places, like as in former times they did to Plato's Academy, or Aristotle's Lyceum. This <HI>Ernest</HI> and <HI>Albert,</HI> returning conquerour from the battaill at Hulsten, with other great Princes, and men of all sorts, came in troops to see and behold. While he was thus busied, and hauing now liued aboue threeskore and eleuen yeeres, he fell sicke in Iune in the yeere of our Lord 1598, and growing euery day worse and worse, at length, he yeelded to nature and died vpon the 28 day of the same moneth. The Physicians affirmed that he died of an vlcer of the reines, which Hippocrates writeth will hardly euer be cured in old men. He was of stature tall and slender; the haire of his head and beard was of a yealow colour. His eies were gray, and his forehead broad. He was very courteous and affable. In serious businesses he was very graue and sober, but without any shew of arrogant dis∣daine: in mirth and iesting he was as pleasant, yet with that moderation, that all was guided by the rules of Chri∣stian piety and modesty. This deceased bachelour, Anna Ortell, a virgine his sister, who liued not long after this her brother Abraham, (for she died in the yeere of Grace 1600) caused to be buried and intombed in Saint Mi∣chaëls, the Abby of the Praemonstratenses in Antwerp. He might well want the honour of a gorgeous and costly tombe, who by the generall consent of all men, had for his rare and singular vertues deserued an euerlasting fame and reputation. Francis Sweert, the yonger, gathered together the mournefull verses of those poets and friends of his, which did bewaile his death, set them foorth, and dedicated them to the State and citizens of Antwerp. Iustus Lipsius, at the instant request of his heires, and for a perpetuall memoriall of their constant loue and friendship wrote that Epitaph which is in capitall letters ingrauen vpon his tombe.</P>

<HEAD>ABRAHAM ORTE∣LIVS CITIZEN OF ANT∣werpe, and Geographer to Philip the second, King of Spaine, to the cour∣teous Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Eeing, that as I thinke, there is no man, gentle Reader, but knoweth what, and how great profit the knowledge of <HI>Histories</HI> doth bring to those which are serious students therein; I doe verily beleeue and perswade myselfe, that there is almost no man, be it that he haue made neuer so little an entrance into the same, and touched them neuer so lightly, that is ignorant how necessary, for the vnderstanding of them aright, the knowledge of <HI>GEOGRA∣PHY</HI> is, which, in that respect therefore is of some, and not without iust cause called <HI>The eye of History.</HI> For thou shalt meet with many things in the reading of Histories, (I will not say, almost all) which, except thou haue the knowledge of the countreys and places mentioned in them, cannot onely not bee well conceiued and vnderstood, but also oft-times they are cleane mistaken and otherwise vnderstood then they ought to bee: which thing commeth to passe in many discourses: but especially in the expeditions and voyages of great Kings, Captaines and Emperours: in the diuers and sundry shiftings of Nations from one place to another: and in the traueils and peregrinations of famous men, made into sundry countreys. But seeing that this is a matter which euen experience it selfe doeth teach vs to be true, there is no reason why I should stand long vp∣on the proofe of the same. This so necessary a knowledge of <HI>Geography,</HI> as many worthy and learned men haue testified, may very easily be learn'd out of <HI>Geographicall Chartes</HI> or Mappes. And when we haue acquainted our selues somewhat with the vse of these <HI>Tables</HI> or Mappes, or haue attained thereby to some reasonable knowledge of <HI>Geography,</HI> whatsoeuer we shall read, these <HI>Chartes</HI> being placed, as it were certaine glasses before our eyes, will the longer be kept in memory, and make the deeper impression in vs: by which meanes it commeth to passe, that now we do seeme to perceiue some fruit of that which we haue read. I omit here, that the reading of <HI>Histories</HI> doeth both seeme to be much more pleasant, and in deed so it is, when the Mappe being layed before our eyes, we may behold things done, or places where they were done, as if they were at this time present and in doing. For how much we are holpen, when as in the Holy Scripture, we read of the iourney of the Israëlites, which they made from <HI>Egypt,</HI> through the Red sea, and that same huge Wildernesse, into the Land of promise, when as looking vpon the Mappe of <HI>Palestina,</HI> we doe almost aswell see it as if we were there, I thinke any student in Diuini∣tie, or that History hath oft made triall. Which things being so, how much those which are students and louers of <HI>Histories</HI> are combred, hindred and stayd, yea, &amp; many times, euen while they are in their race and continued course, drawne backe, it is an easie matter to conceiue, when either the description of all countreys cannot be gotten, or if they may be gotten, they are dea∣rer then that euery mans money will reach and attaine vnto especially those that are but poore, or none of the wealthiest. For there are many that are much delighted with <HI>Geography</HI> or <HI>Chorography,</HI> and especially with Mappes or Tables con∣tayning the plotts and descriptions of Countreys, such as there are many now adayes extant and euery where to be sold: But because that either they haue not that, that should buy them: or if they haue so much as they are worth, yet they will not lay it out, they neglect them, neither do they any way satisfie themselues. Others there are who when they haue that which will buy them, would very willingly lay out the money, were it not that by reason of the narrownesse of the roomes and places, broad and large Mappes cannot so be opened or spread, that euery thing in them may easily and well be seene and discern'd. For, that I may speake that which is the trueth, those great and large <HI>Geographicall</HI> Maps or Chartes, which are folded or rowl'd vp, are not so commodious: nor, when any thing is peraduenture read in them, so easie to be look'd vpon. And he that will in or∣der hang them all along vpon a wall, had need haue not only a very large &amp; wide house, but euen a Princes gallery or spacious Theater. This I hauing oft made triall of, I began to bethinke my selfe, what meanes might be found to redresse these discom∣modities, which I haue spoken of, and either to make them somewhat lesse, or, if possibly it might bee, to take them all cleane away. And at length me thought it might be done by that meanes which we haue obserued and set downe in this our booke, to which I earnestly wish that euery student would affoord a place in his Library, amongst the rest of his bookes.</P>
<P>But that thou mayest the better vnderstand, what it is that wee haue done in this our Theater, and what it is that thou must exspect and looke for in the same; I thinke it not amisse in few wordes briefly here to declare vnto thee. First
<PB REF="4"/> my purpose was to represent vnto thy view whatsoeuer heretofore thou had'st, or new hast, in any <HI>Geographical</HI> or <HI>Choro∣graphicall</HI> Chartes here and there lately or long since set out that euer came to my handes, or were possibly to bee gotten for loue or money. Of all countreys whose descriptions are set out in <HI>Geographicall</HI> Tables, we haue selected one (for of some there are diuers) which in our iudgement seemed to bee the best and most exact: Which, notwithstanding that it were, by the first draught of the Authour somewhat large and broad, we haue brought into that small forme, as might agree with this our worke, and that the whole Mappe might be contein'd in one leafe: or, which sometime thou shalt obserue we haue done, as thou may'st see, that in one leafe many might bee contein'd and expressed: yet so as nothing, no neuer so small a thing, is either omitted or altered that was to bee found in the greater: except it be this, which oftentimes thou shalt finde, that the names of places and other things, which in the first Copies could hardly be read, in these our Mappes we haue so expressed, that they may perfectly be read of any man. And sometime, where occasion did serue, or need require, and the place would permit, vnto the moderne and vsuall names of certaine places, wee haue added the ancient names mentioned by old writers, but now vulgarly vnknowne. Which, as we doubt not, we haue done with the good-leaue and liking of the Authours themselues: so I hope it will be a thing very well pleasing to all such as are readers and students of old Histories and Antiquities. In those Mappes, which haue their Authours names written vpon them, we haue, as I said, altered nothing at all, excepting two or three of the Marine tracts of the <HI>Low-countreys,</HI> which the Sea hath much changed since the time that their descriptions were first set foorth: As for examples sake, in <HI>Flaunders,</HI> ouer against <HI>Zeland,</HI> not farre from the towne <HI>Wateruliet,</HI> where by the goodnesse and great benefit of Almighty God, long after that the description of this Countrey was first set out, the Maine-land was much enlarged and had gotten an aduantage of the Sea: wee there haue altered the forme of that Mappe, according as the place is found to be at this day. The description of which plot of ground we obteined of Master <HI>Marke Lau∣rine,</HI> the Lord and owner thereof, a braue gentleman, greatly renowmed both for the noble stocke from whence hee is descen∣ded, as also for his wisdome and great experience. But in other Mappes, which had no name of the Authour subscribed vnto them, we were somewhat more bold: for in these, in some places, at our discretion, where we thought good, wee haue al∣tered some-things, some-things we haue put out, and otherwhere, if it seemed to be necessary, we haue put in. Of some Coun∣treys also, that we might, as much as in vs did lye, make vp our iust number and fill vp our ranke, we haue made some Mappes of our owne, that there might as few Mappes be wanting as possibly might be. In the abridgement and bringing of those Mappes, which had as I said the names of the Authours added vnto them into a lesser forme, we haue vsed that faithfulnesse and diligence, that we hope to deserue thankes not onely of the Reader, but also euen of the Authours themselues, or at least we haue dealt so in them, that no man need be asham'd of these of ours whatsoeuer they be; yea he may aswell acknowledge and take this little one of ours, for his owne, as that greater one first set out by himselfe. For wee haue endeuoured to the vttermost of our power in this our worke, if it were possible, to deserue thankes of the Authours, if not, yet by no meanes to displease them: Not to follow or imitate that bad custome of some men in these our dayes, who, that they may seeme to the world to set foorth some new thing, doe nothing els but alter the workes and labours of other men, and oftentimes, out of those which are good, to select that which is not good, and to sell it commonly for the best: Sometimes by adding something at their pleasure, and in some places againe taking out and detracting something and withall either by concealing the right Authors names, or setting to their owne, or feyning a name of some one or other, they thinke to please the vulgar sort with nouelties, that that their worke may sell the better; and they may rake money together they care not how: For we were not mooued to vndertake this labour by any couetous desire of getting much by it, but euen of a willing and forward minde that wee had to helpe and further those that had a loue and affection to these studies, not any whit respecting the gayning of any vaine glory and commendation by other mens labours. For what need we to make new Mappes, when as the old Mappes of other men, now extant, would serue our turne? Some there are peraduenture, which will looke to finde in this our Theater more de∣scriptions of particular Countreys, (for euery man naturally, for the loue that he beareth to his natiue soile, would, I doubt not, wish that it were here seuerally described amongst the rest:) but let them know, that those which are here missing, are not left out and omitted, either by our negligence, or for that we were lothe to be at that cost and charges: but because that ei∣ther we neuer saw any such, or at leastwayes for that there neuer came any such to our hands. If there be any man, which either hath any such, or knoweth where there may be had, him we would earnestly entreate, that he would be the meanes to helpe vs vnto them, assuredly promising him, that we will, at our owne cost and charges, not without great thankes to him, and a most honourable mention of his name, cause them to be cut and imprinted apart and by themselues, that hereafter they may be inserted into this our Booke, either in their owne place, elsewhere, as any man shall like best.</P>
<P>Of the Order also by vs here obserued in the placing of these our Mappes, I thinke it not amisse, gentle Reader, to speake a word or two, and to acquaint thee with our purpose: that if peraduenture there be any man, which doeth thinke that they ought to haue bene placed otherwise, we may either satisfie him, if we may, or els excuse our selues, which is all, I thinke, that can be looked for at our hands. First of all, we present vnto thy view an <HI>Vniuersall Mappe</HI> of the whole world: Then, the foure quarters or principall parts of the same; to wit, <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America:</HI> in this following dame Na∣ture, in which alwayes before the parts can be, the whole, whereof they be the parts, must of necessitie first be. Next after these we haue put the seuerall and <HI>particular Countreys</HI> of these parts, beginning at the West part of the world, in this fol∣lowing <HI>Ptolemey</HI> the Prince of Geographers, and almost all others that haue written of this argument: And so the Pro∣uinces and <HI>particular countreys of America</HI> do first put foorth and shew themselues: next to these do follow the <HI>Brittish Iles,</HI> after them <HI>Spaine,</HI> and then <HI>France.</HI> From hence we passe to <HI>Germany:</HI> whose Countreys being after our maner dili∣gently surueyed, from <HI>Heluetia</HI> or <HI>Switzerland</HI> we passed ouer the Mountaines into <HI>Italy,</HI> which is the next countrey vnto it Eastward, purposing also to view all the Prouinces thereof seuerally. From thence we crossed the Sea and sayl'd into <HI>Greece.</HI> Whereupon going into <HI>Slauonia,</HI> we surueyed all the Countreys seuerally which do vulgarly speake the Slauonian
<PB REF="5"/> tongue, (to wit, <HI>Hungary, Transsyluania, Polonia, Scandia,</HI> and <HI>Russia.</HI>) Thus hauing finished <HI>Europe,</HI> we come vn∣to the <HI>Isthmus</HI> or Straight land, which is betweene the head of the Riuer <HI>Tanais</HI> and the North sea, which is in deed the bound of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia:</HI> from it we step into <HI>Asia.</HI> Which, after we haue a while beheld, we left, and so passed into <HI>Afri∣ca,</HI> by the Streights, or narrow piece of the Mainland, which runneth betweene the Bay of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the gulfe of <HI>Damiata, (Sirbonis lacus)</HI> made by the ouerflowing of the Midland-sea. From thence passing through <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Barbary</HI> wee came vnto the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> which we crossed, and at length came home againe to our owne natiue countrey from whence we first set foote; like vnto a trauailer or a Pilgrime, which hath viewed and trauailed through many and sundry seuerall Nations and Countreys, passing out of one into another, orderly as they lay and were situate one by another, ouer∣skipping none, at last returneth safely and ioyfully from whence he first set foorth.</P>
<P>Thus farre of the Mappes themselues: Now let vs speake a word or two of the backside of the same. Because we thought it would be a thing nothing pleasing to the Reader or Beholder, to see the backesides of the leaues altogether bare and empty we determined there to make a certaine briefe and short declaration and Historicall discourse of euery Mappe, in the same maner and order as we said we obserued in the Mappes themselues; omitting nor concealing any mans name, that we had oc∣casion to vse. Moreouer to these also we haue added a Table of the names of all the Authours, that euer wee knew or had; out of which, those that are so disposed, may fetch a more ample and larger discourse and description of the seuerall Countreys handled by them. Wherefore the students of <HI>Geography</HI> shall haue here, in the Authours thus named in order, and in the Catalogue of the Authours of the Geographicall Tables or Mappes, which we haue set before this our worke, and lastly in these Tables themselues, a certaine shoppe, as it were, furnished with all kinde of instruments necessarily required in such like businesse: out of which, if peraduenture there may seeme any thing wanting, in his iudgement, either to the finishing of any Booke of that argument, or more fuller descriptions of any Countreys whatsoeuer, very easily, or in deed without any la∣bour at all he may see, from whence it may by and by be fetched.</P>
<P>These things they are which I thought good to admonish the Reader of. It remaineth now, that wee doe entreate euery man, to take this our labour and entertaine it, with no other minde then it was by vs both begunne and finished, and at length set out and Imprinted. Farewell, and wish well to <HI>Francis Hogenberg, Ferdinand,</HI> and <HI>Ambrose Arsen,</HI> by whose skil∣full hands and extraordinary great paines and diligence almost all these Mappes were engrauen and cut.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE WHOLE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Map next ensuing containeth and representeth the portraiture of the whole earth, and of the maine Ocean that enuirons &amp; compasseth the same: all which earthly Globe the Ancients (who were not as then acquainted with the New world, not long since de∣scried) diuided into three parts; namely, <HI>Africa, Europe,</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> But since that discouery of <HI>America,</HI> the learned of our age haue made that a fourth part, and the huge Continent vnder the South pole, a fifth. <HI>Gerardus Mercator</HI> the Prince of moderne Geographers in his neuer-sufficiently-commended vniuersall Table or Map of the whole world, diuides this Circumference of the earth into three Continents: the first he calles that, which the Anci∣ents diuided into three parts, and from whence the holy Writ beares record, that mankinde had their first origi∣nall, &amp; first was seated: the second, is that which at this present is named <HI>America</HI> or the <HI>VVest Indies:</HI> for the third, he appoints the South maine, which some call <HI>Magellanica,</HI> as yet on very few coasts thorowly discouered. That this orbe or masse of the earthly Globe containes in circuit, where it is largest, 5400 German or 21600 Italian miles, antiquity hath taught, &amp; late Writers haue subscribed to their opinion. <HI>And these so manifold portions of earth</HI> (sayth <HI>Plinie</HI> in the 11. booke of his Naturall historie) <HI>yea rather, as some haue termed them, the pricke or center of the world (for so small is the earth in comparison of the whole frame of the world) this is the matter, this is the seat of our glorie. Here we enioy honours, here we exercise authoritie, here we hunt after riches, here men turmoile and tire themselues, here we moue and maintaine ciuill dissensions, and by mutuall slaughter make more roome vpon the earth. And to let passe the publike tumults of the world, this in which we force the borderers to giue place and remoue farther off, and where we incroch by stelth vpon our neighbors lands: as he that extends his lands &amp; lordships farthest, and cannot abide that any should seat themselues too neere his nose, How great, or rather how small a por∣tion of earth doth he enioy? Or when he hath glutted his auarice to the full, How little shall his dead carcase possesse?</HI> Thus far <HI>Plinie.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hy <HI>Europe</HI> should be so called, or who was the first Authour of this name, no man as yet hath found out; vnlesse (sayth <HI>Herodotus</HI> in his fourth booke) we should thinke that the whole region borrowed this name from <HI>Europa</HI> daughter to the King of <HI>Epyrus.</HI> This <HI>Plinie</HI> calleth the Nurse of the victorious and conquering people of all other nations of the world, most beautifull and farre surpassing the rest: and so it is some∣times compared to <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> not for his greatnesse and compasse, but for his might and power. Certaine it is, that this part, being most plentifully inhabited, is for multitude of nations inferiour to neither of the other. The North and Westerne sides hereof are bathed by the Ocean; the South coast is disioyned from <HI>Africa</HI> by the Mediterranean sea. Then Eastward by the Aegaean sea (now called <HI>Archipelago</HI>) by the Euxin sea (named at this present <HI>Mar Maggiore</HI>) by the lake of <HI>Maeotis</HI> (now termed <HI>Mar delle Zabacche</HI>) by the riuer Tanais (commonly called <HI>Don</HI>) and by the Isthmus or straight of the maine land, which is from the head or fountaine of this riuer directly vnto the North Ocean; it is diuided from <HI>Asia,</HI> according to the opinion of <HI>Glarean.</HI> And thus it beares the shape of a Peninsula (which signifies a place of the earth almost disioyned and cut from the Conti∣nent, and so well neere on euery side enuironed with waters) as in the Table it selfe is ma∣nifest. The head hereof <HI>Rome,</HI> was whilome conqueresse of the earth.</P>
<P>The regions thereof (as they are now called) are <HI>Spaine, France, Germanie, Italie, Sla∣uonia, Greece, Hungarie, Poland</HI> with <HI>Lithuania, Moscouia,</HI> or more significantly <HI>Russia;</HI> and that Peninsula which conteineth <HI>Norway, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Gotland.</HI> Among the Isles thereof the first place is due to <HI>Britany</HI> conteining <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> then followes <HI>Ireland, Groenland, Frisland,</HI> and <HI>Island:</HI> all situate in the maine Ocean. In the Mediter∣ran sea it hath <HI>Sicilia, Sardinia, Corsica, Candia, Maiorica, Minorica, Corfu, Negro∣pont;</HI> and others of lesse note, the particular names and situations whereof are to be seene in the Table.</P>
<P>This our <HI>Europe,</HI> besides the Roman Empire reuerenced of all the world, hath in all (if you adde those foureteene, which <HI>Damianus à Goes</HI> reckens vp only in <HI>Spaine</HI>) eight and twentie Christian Kingdomes: whereby you may estimate the worthinesse of this region. It is a place out of measure fruitfull: and the naturall disposition of his aire is ve∣ry temperate. For all kindes of Graine, for Wine, and abundance of Woods, it is infe∣rior to none, but comparable to the best of the others. It is so pleasant, and so beautified with stately Cities, Townes and Villages, that for the courage and valour of the people and seuerall nations, although it be lesse in quantitie and circuit, yet might it well be ac∣counted, and indeed of all ancient Writers hath it euer beene accounted superiour vnto the other parts of the World: most renowmed also hath it beene both in regard of the Macedonian Empire, and the great command and power of the Romans. The praises thereof you may reade in <HI>Strabo,</HI> who in his third booke, and seuen bookes fol∣lowing, hath most learnedly and excellently described it. Peruse also other ancient Ge∣ographers. Of late Writers, amongst other things by the way, <HI>Ʋolateranus, Sebastian Munster, Dominicus Niger, Georgius Rithaimerus,</HI> in their Geographies, haue en∣deuoured to paint it out in his colours. But <HI>Pius</HI> the second, <HI>Christopher Cella</HI> and <HI>An∣selmus</HI> his brother haue described it a part and by it selfe.</P>
<P>Diuers Iournals ouer all <HI>Europe</HI> in a maner, together with the distances of places, haue beene committed to writing by <HI>Cherubin Stella, John Herbacius,</HI> and <HI>George Mayerus.</HI> The like hath beene done by <HI>William Gratarolus</HI> in the end of his booke, which is entitled, <HI>De regimine iter agentium,</HI> or <HI>A direction for trauellers.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His the Ancients haue diuersly distinguished; but at this present it is diuided by <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> of <HI>A∣frica,</HI> into foure chiefe parts; <HI>Barbarie, Numidia, Libya,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Negros.</HI> BARBARIE, which is accounted the best, they circumscribe with the Atlantick &amp; Mediterranean seas; with mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> &amp; with the region of <HI>Barcha</HI> bordering vpon <HI>Aegypt.</HI> NVMIDIA, called by the inhabitants <HI>Biledulgerid,</HI> and abounding with Dates (for which cause the Arabians call it by no other name, but the Date-bearing region) is bounded Westward by the Atlantick Ocean; Northward by mount <HI>Atlas;</HI> it stretcheth East as farre as the citie <HI>Eloacat,</HI> which is an hundred miles distant from <HI>Aegypt;</HI> and the sandie Deserts of <HI>Libya</HI> embrace it on the South. LIBYA the third part, is named in the Arabian tongue <HI>Sarra,</HI> which word signifies a Desert. It beginnes East from <HI>Nilus,</HI> and thence runneth West as farre as the Atlantick sea; <HI>Numidia</HI> lies to the North of it, and the Land of <HI>Negros</HI> to the South. Now followeth the fourth part, which they call NIGRITARVM <HI>terra,</HI> either from the inhabitants, which are of a blacke colour, or from the riuer <HI>Niger,</HI> that runneth thorow the countrey. It is confined North by <HI>Libya;</HI> South by the Aethiopick Ocean; West by <HI>Gualata;</HI> and East by the Kingdome of <HI>Gaoga.</HI> And here we are to note, that according to this their diuision all <HI>Africa</HI> is included within the Mediterran, Atlantick, and Aethiopick seas and the riuer <HI>Nilus;</HI> wherefore <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Aethiopia</HI> are accounted parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> which we notwithstanding thinke more properly to belong to <HI>Africa:</HI> For the true <HI>Aethiopia</HI> containes at this day <HI>Presbyter Iohns</HI> Empire, which by all late Writers is ascribed to <HI>Africa.</HI> We therefore with <HI>Ptolemey</HI> iudge that it ought to be bounded by the Mediterran and Ocean seas, rather than by any riuer whatsoeuer; and so it hath the forme of a Peninsula, being ioyned to <HI>Asia</HI> by an Isthmos or small neck-land, which lies betweene the Mediterran sea and the gulfe of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The South part here∣of was vnknowen to our ancestours, till the yeere 1497, whereas <HI>Vasco de Gama</HI> first doubling the Cape <HI>de buona spe∣ranza</HI> or <HI>of good hope,</HI> and sailing about <HI>Africa,</HI> came to <HI>Calicut</HI> in <HI>East India.</HI> This Southern part by the Persians and Arabians is called <HI>Zanzibar.</HI></P>
<P>At the foresayd Cape of good hope the inhabitants are exceeding blacke; which we thought in no wise to omit, because all men suppose the cause of blacknesse to be heat, and the nearenesse of the Sunne; wheras here the Sunne scorcheth no more, than about the Streight of <HI>Magellan</HI> (if we measure the heat of the place, according to the positi∣on of the heauens and distance from the Equinoctiall line) where notwithstanding the people are reported to be maruellous white. But if we will needs ascribe this blacknesse to the scorching heat of the Sun, let vs consider, what makes the Spaniards and Italians looke so white, whenas they are equally distant from the Equinoctiall with the in∣habitants of the foresayd Cape; namely the one towards the South, and the other towards the North. <HI>Presbyter Iohns</HI> people are of a browne colour; in <HI>Zeilan</HI> and <HI>Malabar</HI> the inhabitants are coale blacke, yet all in one &amp; the same distance from the aequator, and vnder the very same parallele of the heauens. * And on the contrary, why did <HI>He∣rodotus</HI> and <HI>Pindarus</HI> describe such as inhabited the same climate with themselues, namely <HI>Colchis,</HI> to be of a blacke colour, and curled haire? <HI>Herodotus</HI> in his <HI>Thalia</HI> makes the Indians blacke like the Aethiopians: which the experi∣ence of our times confirmeth. I know <HI>Herodotus</HI> will haue the cause hereof to be the seed of the parents, which he sayth is not white, as that of other people, but blacke. To whom <HI>Postellus</HI> also subscribeth, and imputeth the origi∣nall of this blacknesse vnto <HI>Chams</HI> curse. Against which opinion I haue nothing to allege. Let the trueth of the mat∣ter rest vpon the authours credit. But this a man may thinke more strange; that in all <HI>America</HI> there were no blacke people found besides a few, only in one place called by them <HI>Quareca.</HI> What then is the efficient cause of this colour? Is it the drinesse of the heauen, or of the earth? Is it perhaps some hidden propertie of the soile? Or a kind of qua∣litie inherent to the nature of men? Or is it all these vnited in one? But these things we leaue to be considered by them, who do more curiously search into the secrets of nature.</P>
<P>This portion of the world is called by the Greeks <HI>Libya,</HI> and by the Latines <HI>Africa,</HI> because it is not molested with extremity of colde: or (if we may credit <HI>Iosephus</HI>) from <HI>Afer</HI> one of <HI>Abrahams</HI> posteritie. Another deriuation of the name you haue set downe by <HI>Iohn Leo in the beginning of his first booke of the Description of</HI> Africa, <HI>who deriueth it from the Ara∣bick theme</HI> Faraka, <HI>signifying to disioine or separate; because it is disioyned from</HI> Europe <HI>by the Mediterran sea; from</HI> Asia, <HI>as he saith, by the riuer</HI> Nilus, <HI>or rather as the best authours haue taught, by the Arabian gulfe called of the Greeks</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Mare rubrum <HI>the red sea: of the Hebrewes</HI> <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> iam-suff, mare algosum vel iuncosum <HI>the sedgie sea: of the Arabians the neere inhabitants</HI> Bahci 'lkulzom <HI>the sea alkulzom. Vpon the like reason doth</HI> Iul. Caesar Scaliger <HI>thinke that</HI> Sicilia <HI>was so called of</HI> Seco <HI>which sig∣nifieth,</HI> to cut, <HI>for that this Island was thought of the ancients to haue beene a portion cut from the maine Continent, and sometimes to haue beene ioined to</HI> Italie. <HI>Others, after their maner,</HI> nullo digno autore, nullo solido &amp; certo argumento, <HI>do fetch the name of</HI> Africa <HI>from</HI> Africus <HI>a king of blessed</HI> Arabia, <HI>whom they affirme to haue brought colonies hither and to haue first inhabited the same.</HI></P>
<P>The principall islands of this part (for here to expresse all by name, we thinke it not necessarie, because they are to be seene in the Table) are <HI>Madagascar,</HI> the <HI>Canaries,</HI> the isles of <HI>Cape verde,</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas</HI> island situate vnder the ae∣quinoctiall, which aboundeth with sugar.</P>
<P>Among the olde Writers none haue particularly described this region. But concerning the same reade <HI>Salust</HI> his <HI>Bellum Iugurthinum; Hanno</HI> his nauigation about <HI>Africa,</HI> in <HI>Arrianus;</HI> and <HI>Iambolus</HI> his voyage, in <HI>Diodorus Siculus;</HI> and likewise <HI>Herodotus</HI> his <HI>Melpomene. Barlaams</HI> narration of the inner <HI>Aethiopia</HI> or <HI>India</HI> is extant in the Augustan Librarie. Of late Writers reade <HI>Aloysius Cadamostus, Vasco de Gama, Francis Aluarez,</HI> who trauelled <HI>Aethiopia.</HI> But of all others <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> hath most exactly described it; and <HI>Ludouicus Marmolius;</HI> and <HI>Liuius Sanutus. Iohn Barros</HI> also pron iseth a volume of <HI>Africa.</HI> Concerning the riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> the greatest in all the world, you haue the letters of <HI>Iohn Baptista Ramusius</HI> and <HI>Ierom Fracastorius. Of</HI> Africa <HI>likewise you may reade at large in the second volume of</HI> M. Richard Hakluyts <HI>English voyages.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The New World, commonly called AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat all this Hemisphere or halfe-rundle (which is called <HI>America,</HI> and in regard of the large extension, <HI>The New world</HI>) should lie concealed from our ancestours, till the yeere of Christ 1492, at what time <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> a Genoway first discouered the same; is a matter surpassing the measure of human admiration. For considering both the diligence of ancient Geographers in describing the World, and the commodious opportunitie of most large Empires for the searching out of new Regions, then also the insatiable auarice of mankinde, leauing nothing vnattempted for the attaining of Golde and Siluer, wherewith these Countries incredibly abound; I haue often wondered, how it could so long haue beene hidden from our World. Some there are which suppose that this Continent was described by <HI>Plato</HI> vn∣der the name of <HI>Atlas:</HI> my selfe also am of opinion, that <HI>Plutarch</HI> speaking of the face in the bodie of the Moone, makes mention thereof vnder the name of a Maine continent. Some thinke that <HI>Seneca</HI> rauisht with a Poeticall furie, presaged the discouerie hereof in these Propheticall verses <HI>in the very end of the</HI> 2. <HI>Act. of</HI> Medea:</P>
<Q><L>—venient annis</L>
<L>Secula seris, quibus Oceanus</L>
<L>Vincula rerum laxet &amp; ingens</L>
<L>Pateat tellus, Typhis{que} nouos</L>
<L>Detegat Orbes,</L>
<L>Nec fit terris vltima Thyle.</L></Q>
<P>In English thus:</P>
<Q><L>Long hence those yeeres will come,</L>
<L>When th'Ocean shall dissolue</L>
<L>Natures fast bonds and barres.</L>
<L>Then shall huge lands appeare,</L>
<L><HI>Typhis</HI> shall then detect</L>
<L>New worlds; nor <HI>Thyle</HI> then</L>
<L>Shall bound the paths of men.</L></Q>
<P>Like to those Sibyllin verses, which (as <HI>Iacobus Nauarchus</HI> writeth) were found at the foot of the promontorie of the Moone (commonly called <HI>Rochan de Sinna</HI>) vpon the Ocean sea-shore, ingrauen vpon a foure-square pillar, in the time of <HI>Don Emmanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugall,</HI> to this or the like purpose:</P>

<P>Howbeit, that these verses are not ancient, but grauen in our times; nor part of <HI>Sibylles</HI> Prophesies, but counterfait; I was ad∣uertised (being in hand with the second edition of this my <HI>Theatrum</HI>) from <HI>Rome,</HI> by <HI>Caesar Orlando</HI> a Ciuilian, in his letters, out of some printed works of <HI>Gaspar Varerius,</HI> in which since that I my selfe haue read the same. And afterward I found it confirmed by <HI>Amil. Resende</HI> in his Antiquities of <HI>Portugale:</HI> namely, that in the time of <HI>Don Emmanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugale,</HI> one <HI>Hermes Caiado</HI> of the same countrey, caused them to be ingrauen and buried in the earth: and when he supposed that the marble began to corrupt with the moisture of the ground; pretending some cause of recreation, he inuites his friends to a countrey-house of his, neere vnto which this fained Prophesie lay hid. Wherefore being all set at meat, in comes his Bailiffe with newes, that his Labourers had by chance digged vp a stone engrauen with letters. They all immediatly runne forth, they reade it, they admire it, they highly esteeme it, and are ready to adore it, &amp;c. See how apt <HI>Caiado</HI> was to delude his friends. <HI>Marinaeus Siculus</HI> in his Chronicle of <HI>Spaine</HI> writes, that there was found in Gold-mines an ancient piece of coine with <HI>Augustus Caesars</HI> image vpon it, and for the more confirmation of the matter, that it was sent by the Archbishop of <HI>Consance</HI> to the Pope. But I am of opinion, that it was there lost by the same fa∣milie which first found it. <HI>Iosephus Acosta</HI> in his booke <HI>De Natura noui orbis</HI> indeuours by many reasons to proue, that this part of <HI>America</HI> was originally inhabited by certaine Indians, forced thither by tempestuous weather ouer the South sea which now they call <HI>Mare del Zur.</HI> But to me it seemes more probable, out of the historie of the two <HI>Zeni,</HI> gentlemen of <HI>Venice</HI> (which I haue put downe before the Table of the South sea, and before that of Scandia) that this New world many ages past was entred vpon by some islanders of <HI>Europe,</HI> as namely of <HI>Groenland, Island,</HI> and <HI>Frisland;</HI> being much neerer thereunto than the Indians, nor disioy∣ned thence (as appeares out of the Map) by an Ocean so huge, and to the Indians so vnnauigable. Also, what else may we conie∣cture to be signified by this word <HI>Norumbega</HI> (the name of a North region of <HI>America</HI>) but that from <HI>Norway,</HI> signifying a North land, some Colonie in times past hath hither beene transplanted? But why in mine opinion the maine Ocean was neuer sailed by ancient Nauigatours, I haue declared in my <HI>Thesaurus Geographicus,</HI> speaking of OPHIR.</P>
<P>All this part of the World, (except the North tract thereof, whose Coasts are not yet discouered) hath in these last times beene sailed round about. From North to South it stretcheth in forme of two Peninsulae or Demi-isles, which are seuered by a very nar∣row Isthmos or neck-land. The Northermost of the two conteineth <HI>New Spaine,</HI> the prouince of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the countrey of <HI>Florida</HI> and <HI>New-found-land.</HI> But the Southermost (which the Spaniards call <HI>Terra firma</HI>) containes <HI>Perú</HI> and <HI>Brasil.</HI> A description of all which regions the studious in Geography may reade in <HI>Leuinus Apolonius,</HI> in the Decads of <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> and in <HI>Maximilianus Transsiluanus,</HI> who writ all in Latine. Also to this purpose you haue many things worthy the obseruation in the Iesuites Epistles, and in <HI>Maffeius</HI> his story of the Indies. <HI>Postellus</HI> also promiseth Discourses of West-Indie-matters: and so doth <HI>Fredericus Furius Caeriolanus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The peaceable or the south sea, called by the Spaniards MAR DEL SVR.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His sea albeit vnknowen, yet was it not vnnamed by ancient writers: for <HI>Plinie</HI> calles it <HI>Ecum,</HI> and <HI>Orosius Orientale,</HI> that is, The East sea. <HI>Ptolemey</HI> falsly termes it SINVM MAGNVM, A great bay; whereas he should haue nam'd it MARE MAG∣NVM, A great sea. For of all the seas in the world it is the greatest and the widest. In <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> it is described vnder the name of <HI>Mare Cin, (that is, as I interpret it out of Nubiensis Arabs,</HI> Bahci'ltzni vel alkini, Mare Sinarum, <HI>The sea of China</HI>) and in <HI>Haithon Armenus</HI> (whom elswhere we more truly call <HI>Antonie Curchino</HI>) by the name of <HI>Mare Cathay.</HI> Well therefore might it be named by the ancient and middle-age writers; but neuer was it fully knowen and discouered, till <HI>Fernando Magel∣lan</HI> a Portugale sailed thereupon. Seene it was indeed, and as it were saluted in the yeere 1513, by <HI>Vasco Nunnez,</HI> from the coast of <HI>Perú.</HI> But <HI>Magellan</HI> in the yeere of our saluation 1520. hauing passed the streight by him found, and called after his owne name (which it hitherto retaineth, for euery common Mariner calles it The Streight of <HI>Magellan</HI>) with an heroick and Herculean courage entred this sea, which vncertaine it is, whether any shippe before his had euer stemmed. For meditating a voyage to the isles of the <HI>Moluccos,</HI> whereunto the Portugals vsually sailed from West to East; and intending to make thither a shorter cut from East to West, he came at length vnto them by this sea: in one of which isles called <HI>Machian,</HI> he was slaine in a skirmish. The course of his voyage was this: Departing from <HI>Siuil</HI> with fiue ships, whereof one being his owne, was called by a name of good presage <HI>Victoria,</HI> he came to the fortunate or <HI>Canary-isles;</HI> then to the <HI>Gorgones</HI> or <HI>Hesperides,</HI> now termed The isles of <HI>Cape verde;</HI> and thence to the Streight abouenamed: which when he had found and past thorow, he enters into this sea; where with a fresh and prosperous gale hauing sailed vpon the maine 40. dayes together, and beholding nothing but sea on all sides, and still the sea; when he had crossed the South tropick he descried two small barren and vnhabited isles: where notwithstanding, because they found good fishing, they staied two dayes &amp; then departed, calling them the Vnfortunate isles. Now, they are knowen by the name of <HI>Tuberones,</HI> and the isles of <HI>S. Peter.</HI> Then he proceeds on his nauigation, &amp; in the space of 3. moneths and 20. dayes, hauing sailed ouer this vast Ocean 2400. leagues, he attained at length to the Aequinoctiall, and thence to the desired <HI>Molucces.</HI> And because (as we haue said) he had for the most part a prosperous &amp; no tempestuous wind, he named this <HI>Pacificum</HI> or The peaceable sea, now called by the common Mariner, The South sea, or <HI>Mar del Sur.</HI> Those that haue written of the New world, say, that this sea about those vnfortunate isles, is most exceeding deepe, and that neere vnto the coast of <HI>Perú</HI> it yeeldeth pearles, and that there are in it 7449. isles, so that some in our times not vnfitly haue called the Western part thereof <HI>Archipelagus</HI> or A sea thicke set with isles: seeing this, like the Aegean sea (which is planted all ouer with the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> the <HI>Sporades,</HI> and many other islands, and is called in the Italian tongue <HI>Archipelago</HI>) is also with isles most nota∣bly replenished. In the bottome of this sea <HI>Francis Vlloa</HI> and <HI>Antonie Digafetta</HI> do report, that there growes a weed of 14. or 15. fathoms high within the water; and that it riseth out of the water to the height of some 4. or 5. fathom: so that sometimes you shall seeme not to saile thorow a sea, but rather thorow a greene medow. The place of <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his booke <HI>De Admirandis</HI> &amp;c. doth not much disagree from this; where he writes of the Phoenicians which inhabited <HI>Gady∣ra,</HI> that when they had sailed a while without the pillars of <HI>Hercules,</HI> they arriued at certeine regions abounding with weeds and slime, which were ouerflow∣ed with the tides of the sea. The very same affirmeth <HI>Iornandes</HI> in the beginning of his Getish history; where he writes, that none could saile thorow the O∣cean, being impassable in regard of weeds or turfs, and for that cause vnknowen. Yea <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Antigonus</HI> out of <HI>Megasthenes</HI> haue left recorded, that all the East Ocean growes full of woods. And that the sea neere <HI>Portugale</HI> should beare Okes laden with mast, <HI>Polybius</HI> reporteth in <HI>Athenaeus.</HI> Also, that the Bay-tree growes in the Red sea, the same authour affirmes vpon the credit of <HI>Pythagoras.</HI> Hereunto you may adde that of <HI>Theophrastus</HI> in his 4. booke of the history of Plants, <HI>cap.</HI> 7.8.9. and the testimony of <HI>Aelianus, lib,</HI> 13. <HI>de Animal. cap.</HI> 3. and <HI>Strabo, lib.</HI> 16. and <HI>Plinie, lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 103. <HI>lib.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 22. and <HI>lib.</HI> 13. <HI>cap.</HI> 25. and <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI> in his naturall questions concerning the face in the orbe of the Moone. All these are in some sort confirmed by <HI>Platoes</HI> fables or histories in his <HI>Timaeus</HI> concerning the isle <HI>Atlantis;</HI> whose sea he affirmes to be vnnauigable by reason of the slime or oaze remaining of the same isles inundation. But concerning the ship called <HI>La Victoria</HI> learne thus much: it is not sayd amisse: <HI>Bare names oft times things named doe resemble:</HI> Manifest it is by this ship, which vnder this happy name, the first voyage that euer she made, was the only ship that caried away the victory of sailing quite ouer the maine Ocean, for so many ages before. For departing from <HI>Spaine,</HI> by the Streight of <HI>Magellan,</HI> to the <HI>Moluccos,</HI> thence hauing doubled the Cape of <HI>Buona Esperança,</HI> and returned, whence she first put forth, she was the first of all ships and inall ages, that euer circumpassed the whole earth. The same ship made out of <HI>Spaine</HI> a second voyage as farre as <HI>S. Domingo</HI> and home againe. Thither also she made a third voyage; but in her returne she was quite lost; neither was it euer knowen what became of her. Anti∣quity would haue thought she had beene taken vp into the skies, and placed among the Constellations, like another <HI>Argo.</HI> Nor had this propheticall verse of the peerelesse Poet beene vnfitly alleged in her commendation: <HI>Then comes another</HI> Tiphys, <HI>another gold-fleeced</HI> Argo. Let <HI>Plinie</HI> now cease to maruell, that out of a small hemp-seed should grow that, which was of force to cary vp and downe the globe of [his] earth. We in our age haue seene with the very same thing this world of [ours, much greater than his] nauigated round about. Ours, I say: which that you may more perfectly vnderstand, do but compare the first Table of our Theatre with the first of our Parergon or By-worke, and you shall see the difference.</P>
<P>And here, I suppose, I shall not bestow my labour altogether in vaine, by adding certaine particulars not commonly knowen, concerning the first discouery hereof. Which by all our late Writers is not vnworthily ascribed to <HI>Christopher Columbus.</HI> For in the yere 1492, he was the first man that laid it open, &amp; made it knowen, and communicated the vse and benefit thereof to the Christian world. Howbeit I finde, that the North part of <HI>America</HI> (which lieth neerest vnto <HI>Europe,</HI> and to some of our European isles, namely, <HI>Groenland, Island,</HI> and <HI>Frisland;</HI> and is called <HI>Estotiland</HI>) was long since discouered by certaine Frislandish fishers, driuen by tempest vpon that coast: and afterward about the yere 1390, that it was reuisited anew by <HI>Antonie Zeno,</HI> a gentleman of <HI>Venice:</HI> and that by the authority of <HI>Zichmi,</HI> then King of the said isle of <HI>Frisland,</HI> a Prince in those times very valiant, and ouer all that sea, for his warres and victories most re∣nowmed. Concerning this his expedition there are extant in Italian certaine Collections or briefe extracts drawen by <HI>Francis Marcolino</HI> out of the letters of <HI>Nicolas</HI> and <HI>Antonie Zeno</HI> gentlemen of <HI>Venice,</HI> who liued in these parts. Out of which Collections I adde this that followes touching the description of this region. <HI>Estotiland</HI> (he saith) abounds with all things necessary for mankind. In the mids therof stands an exceeding high mountaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That you many bet∣ter vnder∣stand this relation, peruse our Table of <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Scan∣dia.</HI></NOTE> from whence issue foure riuers that water the whole country. The inhabitants are witty, and most expert in all kind of handicrafts. A language and letters they haue peculiar to them∣selues. Howbeit in this Kings Library there are certeine Latine books, no whit vnderstood by them, which might perhaps before that time be there left by some of their European neighbors that had traffique with them. They haue all kinds of mettall, but specially gold, wherewith they mightily abound. They exercise trade of merchandize with the people of <HI>Greenland;</HI> from whence they fetch hides, pitch, &amp; brimstone. The inhabitants say, that towards the South there are countries rich of gold, and replenisht with inhabitants. There are also many &amp; great woods; out of which they haue matter for the building of their ships and cities; whereof and of fortresses there are great numbers. Of the loadstones vse in nauigation they are vtterly ignorant. They also make mention of <HI>Drogeo,</HI> a region toward the South, inhabited by Canibals, and such as are delighted to eat mans flesh; for want whereof, they liue with fishing, which they very much vse. Beyond this there are large countries and another New world; but the inhabitants are barbarous, and go naked: howbeit against the cold of Win∣ter they arme themselues with beasts skinnes. These haue no kind of mettall: they liue by hunting. For weapons they vse long and sharp-pointed staues and bowes. They make warres one vpon another. Gouernours they haue, and lawes wherto they yeeld obedience. Southward of this place they liue in a more temperate climate, hauing cities and idol-temples, wherin they sacrifice liuing men, whose flesh they afterward deuoure. These haue the vse of gold and siluer. Thus much concerning this tract of land, out of the foresaid collections or extracts; wherein this also is worthy the obseruation, that euen then our Europe∣an Pilots by meanes of the loadstone sailed those seas. For I am of opinion, that there is not to be found in any history a more ancient testimony touching the foresayd vse of this stone. And these things I was the willinger to adioyne to this Table, because I see none of them that haue written the histories of the world so much as once mention this matter.</P>
<P>But concerning the loadstone or sea-compasse you are to vnderstand, that the first inuentour therof was <HI>Iohn Goia</HI> a citizen of <HI>Melfi,</HI> whom <HI>Alexander Sardus</HI> in his booke <HI>De inuentoribus rerum</HI> calleth <HI>Flauius Campanus.</HI> For so write the Italians, and so much is confirmed by <HI>Antonie Panormitanus</HI> in this one verse of his: <HI>First</HI> Melfi <HI>Sailors taught, the loadstone how to vse,</HI> and that in the yere of our Sauior 1300. This <HI>Melfi</HI> called <HI>Amalphis</HI> in Latine, is a towne situate vpon the sea-shore of <HI>Lucania. Goropius</HI> ascribes the finding out of this secret to our Danes or Dutchmen; being persuaded hereunto, because the names of the 32. winds written vpon the compasse, are by all Pilots and Mariners, be they French, Spaniards, or of what nation soeuer, expressed in the Dutch tongue: which I confesse to be true, if you except the Italians only: for they both write and speake of these winds in their owne mother-language. Howbeit seeing all our na∣uigatours of <HI>Europe,</HI> be they Spaniards, French, English, or Dutch, do expresse them in our language, I am verily of opinion, that as it was first found and vsed by the Amalfitans or Italians especially within their owne Mediterran sea: so was the knowledge therof from them deriued vnto our Netherlanders, and most of all to those of <HI>Bruges;</HI> whose city at that time (before all traff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>que was reduced to <HI>Antwerpe</HI>) was a famous mart-towne, and frequented by Italians, especi∣ally of <HI>Venice,</HI> as the foresaid <HI>Zeni</HI> report: and according to the testimony of <HI>Peter Quirini, Christopher Fiorouanti,</HI> and <HI>Nicolas Michele,</HI> who in this our Ocean suffered that horrible shipwracke which we reade of in the Italian volumes: witnesse also <HI>Lewis Cadamosta,</HI> who in his Epistles written about the yeere 1454, affirmes this city of <HI>Bruges</HI> to be a Mart inferiour to none else in all the North parts of the world. Wherefore, that the citizens of <HI>Bruges</HI> receiued the vs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the sea-compasse from the Italians, and out of Italian translated the names of the winds into their owne language, and that from them the other nations be∣fore mentioned borrowed this knowledge, I see not well, how it may be denied. Of the nature and admirable vertue of the loadstone you may reade many notable things in <HI>Liuius Sanutus</HI> his description of <HI>Africa,</HI> printed in Italian at <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>The isles or <HI>Salomon,</HI> which in this table you see described about <HI>Noua Guinea,</HI> were not long since discouered by <HI>Oliuer Mendanio,</HI> after he had conducted his fleet out of the part of <HI>Lima</HI> in <HI>Perú,</HI> &amp; had sailed ouer this huge Ocean: as I find recorded in <HI>Iosephus Acosta</HI> his 1. book &amp; 17. chapter <HI>De natura nouiorbis.</HI></P>

It is a region rich of siluer and golde: for it hath very many riuers yeelding sands or graines of perfect gold. Vpon the coast of this countrey are many commodious fishings for pearle. Salt lakes here are diuers, the water whereof through the heat of the Sunne is conuer∣ted into excellent salt. Here is great abundance of <HI>Cassia fistula,</HI> and a kind of fruit in the Mexican language called <HI>Cacao,</HI> somewhat resembling an Almond: which is with them very highly esteemed; for hereof they make a kinde of drinke, to their owne taste most delicate. The seas and riuers belonging to this countrey abound mightily with fish. Their riuers also breed Crocodiles, whose flesh is food to the inhabitants. In these places this creature is for the most part aboue twenty foot long. It is a countrey very mountainous and beset here and there with most lofty and cragged rocks. So great is the diuersity of languages in these regions, that one cannot vnderstand another without an Interpreter. The principall Colonies to be seene in this Table, which in <HI>New Spaine</HI> haue been planted by the Spaniards, are first <HI>Compostella,</HI> the seat of a Bishop, and of one of the Kings counsels. <HI>Colima,</HI> by another name called the city of the Purification. <HI>Guadalajara,</HI> a towne most fa∣mous, and head of the Kingdome of <HI>New Gallicia. Mechoacan,</HI> a Bishops sea also. <HI>Sacatula,</HI> the city of Angels, a mother-towne and a Bishoprick. <HI>Mexico,</HI> a Kingly city, or rather Queene of all the cities in the New world; situate vpon the banke of a lake, or rather of a fenne: yea the very ground-plot of this city is so fenny, that you cannot come thither, nor depart thence but ouer bridges and cawseys. The lake adioyning is salt, being six leagues long and fiue broad. Fishes it hath none, but very small ones; which more aptly may be called wormes than fishes: of whose putrefaction, which is there caused by the heat of Summer, the aire is some∣times so infected, that it is most vnholesome dwelling there: yet is it as much fre∣quented with inhabitants and merchants, as any mart-towne in <HI>Europe.</HI> It is a large city; for in compasse it containeth about three leagues. The other lake adioining to this, is fresh water, and very plentifull of fish; wherein also stand many townes. There are likewise a great number vpon the banks of either lake. In this city (as <HI>Ierome Giraua</HI> reporteth) there was by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third established the seat of an Archbishop, in the yeere 1547.</P>
<P>This citie was taken by the Spaniards 140 yeeres after the first foundation thereof; <HI>Montezuma</HI> at the same time being King, the ninth in number. A won∣der, how in so few yeeres it should grow to such largenesse and magnificence. The nature, situation, and customes of this citie and of the territory adiacent, who desires more perfectly to know, may reade the relations of <HI>Fernando Cortez.</HI> Ex∣tant they are in the volume intituled <HI>Nouus orbis;</HI> and in the volume of Nauiga∣tions printed at <HI>Ʋenice</HI> in Italian: but especially <HI>John Gonsaluo,</HI> who in his little booke of <HI>China</HI> hath a most large description of this region.

It is in all places beautified with thicke woods, with riuers and pooles of fresh wa∣ter: albeit there are lakes naturally salt. The woods breed vp Hogges and Kine in great plentie: the riuers sometimes yeeld graines of gold. It containes six colonies or townes of Spaniards: the principall whereof called <HI>Sant Jago,</HI> is the seat of a Bishop. But <HI>Hauana</HI> is the chiefe mart and hauen towne of all the Isle. Two wonderfull things <HI>Gonsaluo de Ouie∣do</HI> describes in this Isle: one, a valley extended betweene two mountaines some three Spanish miles in length: (the Ancients would haue named it, as in <HI>Gallia Narbonensi,</HI> now called <HI>Prouence, The stony field</HI>) which bringeth forth round stones in so great abun∣dance, that a man may lade whole shippes with them, being by nature framed so exactly round, that no Turner can amend them. The other is a mountaine not farre from the sea, whereout issueth a kind of Bitumen or Pitch in so great a quantity, that it runnes into the sea, and there floats farre and wide, according as it is carried by the waues or windes. This Pitch, they say, is very commodious for the calcking and braying of ships.</P>
<P>HISPANIOLA lies to the East of <HI>Cuba.</HI> This Isle by the first inhabitants was called <HI>Quisquaeia,</HI> afterwards <HI>Haiti,</HI> and <HI>Cipanga</HI> likewise. But the Spaniards name it <HI>Hi∣spaniola,</HI> and (of the principall city) <HI>San Domingo.</HI> The compasse hereof is 350 leagues. It is an Isle rich in Sugar, and it hath many Gold-mines. It is very strange that is reported concerning a little flie very common in this Island, called by the inhabitants <HI>Cucujo,</HI> and as big almost as one of the ioynts of a mans finger, hauing foure wings, two very thin, and the other two greater and harder, wherewith the thin ones are couered. This shineth in the night as glowe-wormes doe with vs. The force of this light is not only in his eyes, sparckling like fire, but also in his sides, so that by lifting vp his wings, he shines more fly∣ing, than when he lies still. By the naturall curtesie of this little creature, all their cham∣bers, they say, are so lightsome euen in the darkest nights, that a man may reade and write very plainly without the helpe of any other light. This light of theirs is augmented by their number; so that many will giue a greater light than a few. Whoso des res a larger de∣scription of these Islands, let him reade the history of the New world written by <HI>Jerome Benzo, Peter Martyr</HI> his Decads of Islands lately discouered, and other writers of <HI>America.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PERV.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Spaniards diuide the South part of <HI>America</HI> into fiue regions, namely, <HI>The golden Castilia, Popaian, Perú, Chili,</HI> and <HI>Brasil. Perú</HI> in times past before the Spaniards comming thither was much larger, vnder the gouernment of the Ingas, than at this present, as <HI>Giraua</HI> and o∣thers write. Now they confine it with <HI>Quito</HI> on the North, and with <HI>Puerto de Plata</HI> on the South. It was thus named from a riuer &amp; hauen named <HI>Perú.</HI> At this present they diuide it, according to the situation thereof, into three parts; into <HI>Sierras, Andes,</HI> and <HI>Plaines.</HI> The plaine countrey they call that which lieth next the sea; <HI>Sierras</HI> are the mountaines; and <HI>Andes</HI> a region beyond the mountaines toward the East.</P>
<P>The head-city of this countrey of <HI>Perú</HI> is <HI>Lima,</HI> otherwise called <HI>La ciadad de les Reges,</HI> where the Kings seat, and the Chancerie of the whole Kingdome remaines. Also it is the sea of an Archbishop, who vnder his iurisdiction hath these Bishopricks following; <HI>Quito, Cusco, Guamanga, Arequipa, Paz, Plata, Trugillo, Guanuco, Chacapoia, Puerto viejo, Guajaquil, Popajan, Charchi, S. Michael,</HI> and <HI>S. Francis.</HI></P>
<P>That this is the richest of golde of all the countreys in the world, besides many other, these few arguments do euidently demonstrate. <HI>Francis Xeres</HI> writeth, that in <HI>Cusco</HI> there were houses, whose pauement, walles &amp; roofes were couered quite ouer with plates of golde. <HI>Giraua</HI> reports, that the inhabitants of the prouince <HI>Ancerna</HI> go to warres all armed in gold from head to foot: their habergions, their brest-plates, their leg &amp; thigh harnesse, con∣sist wholly of gold. The same authour affirmes, that out of certeine gold-mines neere <HI>Quito</HI> is digged more gold than earth. Those that haue written the storie of King <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> do agree in this, that he offered so much golde to the Spaniards for his ransome, as the roome wherein he was prisoner would containe. It was two and twenty foot long, and seuenteene foot broad: this he offered to fill so high as he could reach vpon the wall with his longest finger; or if they thought better (marke also the infinite quantitie of siluer in this region) he offered to fill it twise with siluer euen to the very roofe. It is also recorded, that the Spaniards at their first entrance vpon this countrey, shod their horses with gold and siluer shoes.</P>
<P>This region in times past was gouerned by Ingas (which word signifieth Kings, or supreme Gouernours) of whom I finde this catalogue or pedegree in <HI>Simon Fernandez.</HI> The first was MANGOCAPA; him the Peruuians denie to haue been borne of a man, supposing that he was made out of a certaine rocke, which is to be seene nere <HI>Cusco.</HI> This man of his wife <HI>Mama Guaco</HI> begat a sonne named SICHEROCA. He being more warlike than his father, subdued many bordering nations, and enlarged the limits of his Empire. Of his wife <HI>Mama Cura</HI> he had issue LOCVCOPANGVE, the third Inga. This King thought it better to keepe that which his father had got, than with new conquests to augment his dominions. Being very aged he tooke to wife <HI>Mama Anauerque;</HI> which brought him forth a sonne, and successor, called MAYTACAPA. This successor of his ioyned the prouince of <HI>Cusco</HI> to his fathers Empire. Of his wife <HI>Mama Yacchidela</HI> he begat a sonne named CAPAC YVPANGVE who atchieued nothing worthy of memory. He had also by his wife <HI>Mama Cagna,</HI> a sonne called INGA RVCA. But neither did he in all his life any memorable act; saue that he tooke to wife <HI>Mama Micay,</HI> of whon he begat many sonnes; concerning one of which named <HI>Yaguar Guacinga Iupangue,</HI> they report this story: Being a childe of three moneths old, he was conueyed away by a certain Cacique to be murdred; but while they were consulting whe∣ther they should kill him, or no; it came to passe that drops of bloud trickled from the infants weeping eyes: which they expounding as a matter prodigious, surceased their intent of murdering him. In the meane time be∣ing found by a stranger, and restored to his father, he proued a most valiant and warlike Prince; insomuch that he subdued many bordering nations. He maried <HI>Mama Chiquia,</HI> of whom he had issue male VIRA COCHA, who succeeded him in his Empire, and inlarged it not a little. After him reigned PACHACOTI his sonne borne of his wife <HI>Mama Yunto Cayan.</HI> This Prince in martiall exploits surpassing all his ancestours, conquered di∣uers and sundry nations. He laid the first foundations of the Castle of <HI>Cusco.</HI> After death he left behind him for his heire TOPA INGA YVPANGVE begotten of his wife <HI>Mama Anabarque;</HI> who not only finished the castle that was founded by his father, but treading also in his warlike steps, he wan from his neighbours the kingdoms of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Quito,</HI> annexing the same to his crowne. These common high wayes most admirable to the world, from <HI>Cusco</HI> to <HI>Charchas,</HI> and so to <HI>Chili,</HI> he was the first author of; which being all the way built of <HI>Chasqui</HI> (or as we terme them, woodden piles) he made the iourney very short: for by the benefit hereof he marched with a com∣pany of speedy footmen (a thing incredible in our eares) the space of 120 leagues in three dayes: (for before the Spaniards comming, the inhabitants neuer knew what beasts of cariage meant.) This King left behinde him a∣boue 150 sonnes. But GVAINA CAPA whom he had by his wife <HI>Mama Oclo,</HI> he ordeined to be his heire: who, albeit he had a father so valourous, and so renowmed both in peace and warre; yet by his braue exploits he far surpassed him: for he extended the bounds of the Peruuian Empire a great way farther than before. The Com∣mon wealth he reduced into a better forme, he reformed many lawes, and some he ordained anew. He tooke to wise <HI>Coia Pilico Vaco;</HI> by whom when he could haue no issue, he maried diuers others: of which wiues he begat sonnes not only equall, but superiour in number to those of his father; the eldest whereof was GVASCAR, whose mothers name was <HI>Raua Oclo.</HI> He had also another sonne named ATABALIPA. Betweene these two brothers some dissention arising about the gouernment of the kingdome, <HI>Atabalipa</HI> remaining in <HI>Cassamalca,</HI> and <HI>Guascar</HI> in <HI>Cusco; Atabalipa</HI> marching with an army against his brother, became Victor, tooke him, and caried him captiue to <HI>Cusco,</HI> in which place he afterward put him to death, and was there himselfe also burned by the Spa∣niards. This was the end of these two brothers. Whereupon MANGO <HI>Inga</HI> a third brother tooke the gouern∣ment

But he submitted himselfe to King <HI>Philip,</HI> and became his vassall. This was done in the yeere 1557. the sixth of Ianuary vpon the very feast of the three Kings. Concerning these Ingas, and their memorable acts <HI>Pedro Cieça de Leon</HI> promised a peculiar volume: whether he hath performed it I know not. Sufficeth thus much to haue been spoken of the Kings. Now let vs out of three worthy eye-witnesses adde somwhat concer∣ning the nature and disposition of the people. <HI>Ierome Benzo</HI> of <HI>Millan,</HI> who liued many yeeres in those countries, in his booke of the New world dedicated to Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the fourth, writeth that the inhabitants of <HI>Perú</HI> are natu∣rally indued with a more sharpe and subtile wit, than any other Indians subdued by the Spaniards. The same author (speaking of them in another place;) Marke my words (saith he:) I can by no meanes be induced to be∣leeue that which some report of them; namely, that they are addicted to theft, and that by their lawes, the least robberies deserue hanging. But who can imagine them to be theeues, whenas they are neither couetous nor rich, esteeming nothing more base than siluer &amp; gold? Of which, it they had a minde vnto the same, they might without controlment take as much as they would out of the Mines, like water out of the fountaine. Vnlesse per∣haps they haue learned of the Spaniards to play the thieues, who haue planted their colonies in that country, &amp;c. <HI>Bartholmew de las casas</HI> a Spaniard of the order of <HI>Dominick,</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Chiapa,</HI> a great city of the New world, in that volume which he entitled <HI>The destruction of the Indies,</HI> and dedicated to King <HI>Philip;</HI> he calleth them a peace∣able, humble, gentle, and harmlesse nation: and in another place, a simple, plain-dealing people, void of all ma∣lice, most obedient and faithfull, not only to their owne naturall Princes, but also to Christians that haue any command ouer them. And if there be any in all the world, then these are of a most quiet disposition, not giuen to brauling or tumults, nor greedy of reuenge. Frier <HI>Iodocus de Reijcke,</HI> by order a Franciscan, born in <HI>Mechilin,</HI> who in <HI>Quito</HI> a city of this region, erected the first monastery of his order, writeth in his letters (which I my selfe haue read) to the Guardian of the Franciscans at <HI>Antwerpe:</HI> All these Indians (saith he) thirst after the Gospell, and al∣beit they are barbarous, and without learning, yet nature hath taught them an excellent kinde of gouernment, and behauior. Among them there was not a begger found, notwithstanding they are all poore in food and ap∣parell. And a little after; With these people was found so great iustice and integrity of life, that therein they ex∣cell euen those which abound with books and learning. The same in another letter to the Friers of his order in <HI>Flanders:</HI> It is (saith he) a witty, bold, and warlike nation, giuing vs hope of their easie conuersion to Christianity, if they be not discouraged therefrom by the Spaniards auarice. These letters, I thinke are not printed: The very originals of them, according to his singular humanity and fauor to these my studies were bestowed vpon me by the worthy citizen <HI>Adrian Marselar,</HI> Senatour of <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> being the said <HI>Iodocus</HI> his kinsman by the mothers side. Also of this F. <HI>Iodocus</HI> mention is made by <HI>Ierom Benzo,</HI> &amp; <HI>Pedro Cieça</HI> a Spaniard, in their stories of the <HI>VVest Indies.</HI></P>

<P>THis is part of <HI>North America.</HI> It is called by the name of <HI>Florida</HI> in regard of the feast of <HI>Easter,</HI> which the Spa∣niards call <HI>Pascha Florida,</HI> because vpon that very day in the yeere of our Lord 1512, it was (as I reade in <HI>Gira∣ua</HI>) vnder the conduct of <HI>Iohn Ponce</HI> of <HI>Leon,</HI> first of all coasted, and discouered. <HI>Theuet</HI> (like himselfe) writes, that it was so called, because it was all greene and flourishing. By the inhabitants it was named <HI>Iaquasa.</HI> The French haue more than once attempted to plant a colony here: but hitherto they were neuer able in regard of the Spa∣niards ill will, who oft expelled them from thence. It is inhabited by a sauage, forlorne, and beastly people. They liue vpon spiders, ants, lizards, serpents, and other venimous, and creeping things. The region is very fruitfull, and rich of gold. Concerning this country <HI>Iames Cole</HI> my nephew from the mouth of an eie-witnesse (as he saith) writes vnto me as followeth: The inhabitants are of a brownish colour; but the Kings wiues are blacke by a kind of arte. The King hath power to giue, or rather to sell wiues to such as are desirous to marrie. A married woman being taken in adultery, she is for her incontinency from morning till night bound with her backe to a tree, her armes and legs stretched abroad, and sometimes she is beaten with rods. Their women within three houres after they are deliuered of childe, carry forth their infants, and wash them in the riuer. They haue no hatchets, nor spades, but of stone. In stead of ploughes, they haue certaine woodden pickaxes, wherewith they open the ground, and sowe a kinde of graine commonly called Turkish or Ginny-wheat, whereof they haue yeerely two or three crops. They haue also Pheasants, &amp;c. They sowe in the moneths of May, Iune, and Iuly; and reape within six weeks after. Concerning this region reade the booke of <HI>Iaques Morguez le moine.</HI></P>

The Spaniards haue planted two colonies here: the one is called <HI>Panuco,</HI> of the riuer that runneth by it; and the other <HI>S. Iames,</HI> of the vallies.

The Greekes called it also ALBION, not of <HI>Albion Neptunes</HI> sonne, which sometime sweied the scepter heere, as some haue most fabulously taught; but of <HI>Alphi</HI>ων, the <HI>white cliffes</HI> vpon the sea coast, which first offer themselues to the eie of those which to this our land saile hither from <HI>France:</HI> and indeed the Welch poets call it <HI>Inis win,</HI> that is, as <HI>Orphaeus</HI> the most ancient poet of the Greeks doth interpret it, <HI>Nesos leu caessa,</HI> and <HI>Leucaios Chersos,</HI> The white Ile, or The whiteland.</P>
<P>The first <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> which seated themselues heere not long after the vniuersall Flood and Confusion of <HI>Babel,</HI> came hither from <HI>France,</HI> as by Neerenesse of place, Likenesse of language, Maners, Gouernment, Customes &amp; Name is by the learned <HI>Clarencieux Camden,</HI> the onely light of our histories, in that his thrise renowned <HI>Britannia,</HI> euidently demonstrated.

The <HI>Romanes,</HI> a second nation, vnder the conduct of <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> about the yeare before the birth of CHRIST 54. entered <HI>Brittaine</HI> and planted their colonies in diuers and sundry places of this Iland. The <HI>Scottes,</HI> obseruing the Ro∣man legions to grow weake and their Empire to decline, thereupon tooke occasion first to seise vpon <HI>Ireland:</HI> then a∣bout the yeare of CHRIST 446. great trouble arising in <HI>France,</HI> the Emperours were constrained wholly to withdraw their forces from hence, and to leaue the Brittaines naked and open to the furie of the Pictes their enemies. From hence ensued a double mischiefe: for first the vnquiet and turbulent Pictes, thinking that now the onely opportunitie was offered them to accomplish their desires, thought to make sure worke, called in the <HI>Scottes</HI> out of <HI>Ireland;</HI> combi∣ned themselues together against the poore disarmed Britans: whereupon the Britans were constrained, for safegard of their liues and liberties, to call in, about the yeare of CHRIST 440. the Angles, Saxons and Iuites, a warlike people inhabiting along the sea coast of <HI>Germany,</HI> from the riuer of <HI>Rhein,</HI> vnto <HI>Denmarke,</HI> to aid them against their violent enemies. The <HI>Normanes,</HI> lead by <HI>William</HI> the Bastard, their Duke, tooke possession of Great <HI>Brittaine</HI> in the yeare 1066. The Vandalles, Norweis and Danes, who by their piracies and robberies a long time and oft greeuously vexed these Iles, neuer seated their Colonies heere, and therefore I passe them ouer with silence.</P>
<P>The forme of <HI>Brittaine</HI> is triangular, like vnto that figure which the Geometers call <HI>Scalenum;</HI> or as <HI>Nubiensis</HI> the Arabian saith, to the head and necke of <HI>Alnaama,</HI> the ostrich, and therefore it may aswell as <HI>Sicilia</HI> be called TRINA∣CRIA, The three-cornered Ile. The ancient Geographers did hold it, and that deseruedly, to be the greatest Iland of the Maine Ocean; wherefore <HI>Solinus</HI> saith, it may well deserue the name of ANOTHER WORLD: and <HI>Matthew Pa∣ris</HI> for the same cause calleth it THE QVEEN or Empresse of the Isles of the Ocean. In respect of which large compasse it hath been in former ages diuided into many seuerall iurisdictions and kingdomes: in the time of the Saxons, <HI>England</HI> the South-east part into seuen, and <HI>Wales</HI> into three.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>COTLAND, the North part of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> anciently called <HI>Albanie,</HI> and is of the first inhabitants, (which they call the wilde Scots, and dwell more in within the land, retaining yet the old language,) at this day cal∣led <HI>Albaine,</HI> was formerly called of the Romanes, <HI>Britannia minor</HI> and <HI>secunda,</HI> as <HI>Lhoyd</HI> doth gather out of <HI>Sextus Rufus.</HI> This country is diuided into 2. parts, by the rough &amp; craggy mount <HI>Grampius,</HI> (now <HI>Grantz∣been</HI>) whereof <HI>Tacitus</HI> maketh mention. For it begining at the German ocean, neere the mouth of the ri∣uer <HI>Dee,</HI> coasting along by <HI>Aberden,</HI> through the middest of the country toward the Irish-sea, staieth at the lake <HI>Loumond.</HI> This Mountaine was sometime the bound of the kingdome of the Pictes and Scottes.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> is fuller of mountaines and more barren then <HI>England:</HI> Yet euery where it hath many commo∣dious ports and hauens. For so is this country embraced of the armes of the sea, that there is no house in it, as <HI>Iohn Maior</HI> affirmeth, which is aboue twentie leagues distant from the salt water. In the vallies are Lakes, meeres, pooles, riuers and fountaines well stored with sundrie sorts of fish. In the mountaines are champion plaines, yeelding great store of pasture for cattell, and woods abounding with plenty of Deere. By the meanes of which commodities it hath been so maintai∣ned, that hitherto it might neuer be wholly conquered: For in any eminent danger they presentlie flie to the woods and bogges, for succour and refuge, where they haue of venison and fish sufficient store for prouision of victuall.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> hath many wonders, whereof some we haue heere set downe out of <HI>Hector Boëthus.</HI> In <HI>Galloway</HI> saith he, is a lake called <HI>Myrtoun,</HI> part of whose water in the winter freezeth as other waters do, the other part was neuer knowne to haue beene frozen in the greatest frosts that euer were. In the country of <HI>Carict</HI> there are very great and large Oxen, whose flesh is verie tender and of a pleasant and delicat tast: Besides that, the fatte neuer waxeth hard, but is alway thinne in the manner of liquid oile. The Sea that washeth the coast of this prouince, is very rich of oisters, herrings, congers, cockels, and other such like fishes. In the prouince of <HI>Coyl</HI> about ten miles from the towne <HI>Aër,</HI> is a Stone, hardly twelue foot high, of 33. cubites thicke, called of the inhabitants, <HI>The deafe stone:</HI> For al∣though you shall make neuer so great a noise, nay if one shall shoote off a peece of ordinance on the one side, it shall hardly be heard on the other side, except one bee a good way off from it, for then the sound may easily be perceiued. In <HI>Lennox,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth <HI>Lelgouia, (Lelannonia,</HI> as I conceiue out of <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> but I thinke our authour meant <HI>Selgouiae,</HI> which is farre from this place) there is a very great lake, which they call <HI>Loumond,</HI> aboue twenty foure miles long, and eight miles broad; It conteineth thirtie Ilands, where∣of diuers haue villages well inhabited, with Churches and Chappels dedicated to the seruice of Almighty God. In this three things are especially worth the obseruation. For the fishes there, most wholesome and good, haue no sinnes. The water oft times, when the winds are most calme and still, is so boisterous and rough, that it affraieth the best experienced watermen from putting forth to crosse the same: For the wind being alaied the boates are taken in their midde-course, and are tossed with such danger, that except some com∣modious hauen shall fortune to be neere hand, many times they are ouerturned and cast away. Lastly, there is an iland in it, very good pasture for the feeding of cattell, which swimmeth and moueth euery way as the winds driue. It is credibly reported, that there is a stone which groweth in <HI>Argadia (Argathelia</HI> or <HI>Argile</HI>) which if it be couered but a while with straw or flax, it will set it on fire. At <HI>Slanis,</HI> a castle in <HI>Buquhan,</HI> there is a caue of a strange nature. For the water that droppeth into it in continuance of time is turned into a very white stone; and if within a certaine number of yeares they should not be taken out, it would haue been long since filled vp with them. In this prouince there is no ratte euer seene; and if so be that any should be brought in thither, it will not by any meanes liue there. In the countrie of <HI>Fife</HI> great store of a kind of blacke stone is digged out of the earth, (we call it sea-coale) a most excellent kind of fuell. At the mouth of the riuer <HI>Forth,</HI> in the maine sea there is a very high rocke, out of whose toppe a spring of fresh water, (a great miracle of nature) doth runne abundantlie. About two miles distant from <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> is a spring, vpon the toppe of whose water, dropps of oile, do continually swimme, in such sort, that if you take none from off it, there will be neuer the more: and if you take ought from thence, there will be neuer the lesse. This oile is good against the roughnesse of the skinne. Thus farre of the strange thinges of this Realme. <HI>Scotland</HI> in the countrie of <HI>Drisdaile</HI> hath a mine of <HI>Gold,</HI> in the which also is found that which they commonly call <HI>Lazure.</HI> It hath al∣so mines both of Iron and Lead.</P>
<P>The inhabitants which possesse the South part, on this side the mount <HI>Grampius,</HI> are more ciuill and humane: and do speake the En∣glish tongue. Those which dwell in the North parts, are a rough and more hard kind of people (they call them The wild-Scottes) and do weare mantles and skirts died with Saffron after the Irish fashion, and go barelegged. They speake the Irish tongue. And as the Language of <HI>Scotland</HI> is of two sorts, so are their maners as diuers. These <HI>Marianus Scotus</HI> calleth High-land-men, the other, I meane the wild-Scottes, they call Low-land-men.</P>
<P>The chiefe city of <HI>Scotland</HI> is <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> there is the kings seat, and the castle of Maidens, often mentioned in histories. Saint <HI>An∣drew,</HI> and <HI>Aberdon</HI> are two Vniuersities. The city <HI>Glasow</HI> is the Archbishops sea. The towne of <HI>Perth,</HI> commonly called S. <HI>Iohns-toun,</HI> is the onely towne in <HI>Scotland</HI> that is walled about. Of the wood <HI>Caledon,</HI> (whereof <HI>Ptolemey</HI> and other ancient writers haue recorded.) There is scarcely any mention to be found, onely about the towne of <HI>Sterling,</HI> there remaineth some shew of the name. Thus farre of the kingdome of <HI>Scotland:</HI> now it will not be amisse to speake somewhat of the ilands, that lie round about the same, and do belong vnto that crowne.</P>
<P>The HEBRIDES, (commonly called the <HI>West-iles,</HI>) both for bignesse and number do excell the rest. <HI>Hector Boëthus</HI> saith that they be in number 43. But heere he reckoneth vp the ile of <HI>Man</HI> as one of them, which is not subiect to the kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but is vn∣der the allegeance of the King of <HI>England;</HI> neither do I thinke that it was euer accounted of the ancients among the <HI>Hebrides.</HI> The first of the <HI>Hebrides</HI> is <HI>Aran,</HI> (otherwise called <HI>Boëth</HI>) then <HI>Hellaw</HI> and <HI>Rothes.</HI> Not farre from these is <HI>Alize,</HI> where are great plenty of Bar∣nacles, which they call <HI>Soland-geese</HI> The greatest of all and the most famous is <HI>Ile,</HI> a fertile soile for corne, and rich for veines of mettall. Then <HI>Cumber</HI> and <HI>Mule.</HI> Neere vnto these is <HI>Ione,</HI> memorable for the tombs of Kings long since buried there. Next vnto this is <HI>Lewis,</HI> last of all is <HI>Hirth</HI> situate in the 43. degree of latitude. Thus <HI>Boethus</HI> calleth them. But <HI>Iohn Maior</HI> the Scot nameth them thus, <HI>Argila, Aranea, Awyna, Butha,</HI> or <HI>Rothsaya,</HI> and <HI>Leuisora.</HI> In these ilands are those geese, which they call <HI>Clakes, (Gyraldus</HI> calleth them <HI>Berna∣cles</HI>) which <HI>Boëthus</HI> affirmeth to breed of the sea and of rotten wood; and not to grow vpon trees, as the common sort beleeue and haue published in their writings. For if you shall cast, saith he, a peece of wood into that sea, in continuance of time, first wormes do breed within the wood, which by little and little become to haue heads, feet &amp; wings: at the last being fledge and growen to their full growth, to the bignes of a goose, they attempt to flie, and do somtimes swim and sometimes vse their wings as other Sea-foule do. Beyond the <HI>Hebrides,</HI> are the ORCHADES, (or the <HI>Orkeney iles,</HI>) of which the best is <HI>Pomona,</HI> famous for the Bishops-sea, a goodly Church, and two strong castles. One of these <HI>Iohn Maior</HI> calleth <HI>Zeland,</HI> which is 50. miles in length. In these grow no manner of trees, nor any wheat, and yet otherwise of all other sorts of graine they are very fertile. It breedeth no serpent or venimous beast. In <HI>Scotland</HI> they buy the barrell'd butter: the inhabitants hauing abundance of Barley whereof they make a most strong kind of drinke, and are very great drinkers; yet, as <HI>Boëthus</HI> saith, you shall neuer see a drunken-man, or madde man, one bestraught or a naturall foole amongst them. The same authour affirmeth the like of the inhabitants of the iles of <HI>Scetland:</HI> but this is no wonder, amongst them that drinke nought but water. All the wealth and commodities of these Scetland-men consist in Stockfish, and hides of beastes. In the <HI>Hebrides</HI> they vse the Irish tongue: in the iles of <HI>Orkeney</HI> they speake the Gottish language. M. <HI>Iordanus</HI> in his mappe of <HI>Denmarke</HI> saith that the <HI>Orchades</HI> are subiect to the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke:</HI> yet we know them to belong to <HI>Scotland</HI> vnder the title of a Dukedome. But se what we haue written of this in the discourse to the mappe of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> Of <HI>Scotland</HI> and of the ilands adioining thou maist read more at large in <HI>Hector Boëthus, Iohn Maior,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Lisley,</HI> Scottish-men which haue written the histories of this their country.</P>

<HEAD>Of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He South part of the Iland of <HI>Britaine,</HI> is, as we haue said before, diuided into two parts. That part which is toward the East, abutting vpon the German Ocean, is of the Angles, a peo∣ple of the Saxons which seated themselues there, in their language called ANGLIA, or <HI>England,</HI> that is, the Angles land. The West part, which is seuered from that other by the riuers <HI>Seuern</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> and doth vse the ancient Brittish tongue, is of the same Angles or En∣glishmen called, WALLIA or <HI>Wales:</HI> yet the Brittan or Welshman calleth himselfe <HI>Cumro;</HI> and his country <HI>Cumria;</HI> the English <HI>Saissons;</HI> and their country, <HI>Lhoëgria:</HI> neither do they know, or at least they will not acknowledge, what <HI>England</HI> or an Englishman doth meane: So great difference there is betweene the languages of the seuerall nations of this Iland.</P>
<P>All this South part, <HI>England,</HI> I meane, and <HI>Wales,</HI> hath their proper king, vnto whom many Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Barons and great Noblemen are subiect and obedient. It is a countrie at all times of the yeare most kind and temperate. The Aire is thicke, and so it is much subiect to windes, clowdes and raine: and therefore in regard of thicknesse of the aire it is neither opprest with too much heat or too much cold. For it is found true by ex∣perience that although it be more Northerly than <HI>Brabant, Flanders,</HI> and other forrein countries, yet heere the winter is neuer so bitter nor the frost so eger as in those parts. It hath euerie where many hilles, (without wood and water,) which notwithstanding do bring forth very small and short grasse, an excellent feed for sheepe: and therefore infinite flockes of sheepe do bespread them, which either by reason of the kindnesse of the aire, or goodnesse of the soile, do yeeld most soft wooll farre finer than those of other countries. And for that this country breedeth neither woolues nor any rauenous beast, you shall see in diuers places flocks of sheepe vpon the hilles, and dales, greene pastures, commons, fallowes, and corne fields; into which after the crop is off, euery man, by a certaine ancient custome doth put in his cattell in common, to wander heere and there without a shepheard. This indeed is that <HI>Golden fleece,</HI> in which especially the riches of the in∣habitants doth consist: for an huge masse of gold and siluer, is by Merchants, which thither flocke from all quarters for such like wares, yearly brought into the Iland, and there doth continually rest, for that it is by proclamation forbidden that no man may carry any money out of the Realme. It aboundeth also with all sorts of cattell, except asses, mules, ca∣mels, and elephants. There is in no place of the world greater and larger dogges, nor better.</P>
<P>The soile is very fatte and fertile, and naturally bringeth foorth, beside all sorts of corne and pulse, all maner of things, onely the firre-tree, and, as <HI>Caesar</HI> saith, the beech tree, although that now it hath in diuerse places plenty of beeches. The ay-green Bay tree doth in these Northren countries no where thriue better. Such abundance of Rosemary heere doth grow in all places and that so high, that they oft times do fence their gardens therewith. Wine they haue none, for the grapes seldome heere do ripen, and is amongst them planted rather for shade and pleasure, then for his fruit and profit. There is in no country in Christendome more Crowes than heere, a kind of fowle very harmefull: for it doth not onely spoile the ripe and standing corne, but assoone as it is shotte they will stocke and digge it vp with their billes, so that the husbandmen are faine at that time of the yeare to set Boies in the fields with bow and arrowes (for they are not afraid of mens voices) to skarre them away.</P>
<P>The Ocean or maine sea, which beateth vpon the coast of this Iland, aboundeth with all maner of Fish: of which the <HI>Lucius,</HI> or <HI>Pike,</HI> as they commonly call it, they esteeme as a deinty dish, and therefore they oft take it out of fenny pooles and riuers, and put it into their fishponds and weares; where being purged and cleared from that muddy sauour, feed with eeles and other little fishes, he groweth exceeding fatte and of a holesome and pleasing tast. This fish (which is a very strange thing) being brought aliue into the fishmarket to be sold, they open his belly with a knife, to shew how fatte he is: if he be not sold, yet of that wound he dieth not, but the slitte being sewed vp, and presently put into the pond, a∣mongst the slimie tenches, it is by and by healed againe. There are no where in all the world either more daintie Oisters, or greater store.</P>
<P>It yeeldeth also Gold, Siluer, Copper, and Iron, although no great quantitie of either sort: but of Lead, and Tinne, (the Latines call that <HI>Plumbum nigrum,</HI> this <HI>Plumbum album</HI>) in their kind the best, is heere found in great abundaunce, and from thence is transported to forrein nations.</P>
<P>The people are tall of stature, well fauoured and faire countenanced, for the most part gray eied, and as in maner of pro∣nunciation they much resemble the Italian, so in proportion and feature of body and maners they little or nothing differ from them. They shape their apparell much-what after the French fashion. The women most faire and beautifull, do go very decently and comlily attired. They feed most-what on flesh. The drinke which they vse, and do make of malt, is indeed very good, holesome and pleasant; much sought after in the Low countries, and therefore conueied thither in great abundance. At their meales both dinners and suppers they fare well, daintilie, liberallie, and are very merrie and pleasant. In warre they are courageous and hardie, good archers, and cannot abide delaies and lingring; and therefore when they ioine battell and come to blowes, one part shall soone be vtterly ouerthrowne, for the conqueror seiseth all in∣to his hands. They build no Castles; yea those which their auncestours haue built in former ages, and now are decaied, ruinous and readie to fall, they care not for the reedifying and vpholding of them. Cities they haue, and many faire townes, goodly hamlets, streets, and villages. The chiefe City, mart-towne, and imperiall seat of their Kinges is LON∣DON, situate vpon the riuer of <HI>Thames:</HI> ioined with a faire stone bridge of twenty piles, very goodly arched. Vpon this bridge are houses so built on ech side, that it seemeth almost to be a continuall street, not a bridge. This of the nature of the soile, temperature of the aire, manners and behauiour of the people, we haue for the most part gathered out of <HI>Poly∣dore Virgill</HI> his historie of <HI>England:</HI> for he hath very curiously there described this Iland. In <HI>England</HI> these things are fa∣mous and worth the obseruation, as this verse sheweth, <HI>Mons, &amp; fons, &amp; pons, ecclesia, femina, lana:</HI> Of riuers, and moun∣taines, stone bridges and wooll: Faire women, and Churches, <HI>England</HI> is full.</P>
<P>IRELAND, is subiect to the crowne of <HI>England,</HI> so are diuers other lesser iles, as <HI>Wight, Man, Anglesey,</HI> (the ancient seat of the Druydes, the Welshmen call it, <HI>Tirmôn mam Gumry, Man</HI> the mother of <HI>Wales,</HI> the Latines, this MONA, that other MENAVIA) and those which now we call the <HI>Sorlinges</HI> (the Greeks called them CASSITERIDES.) <HI>Gernsey</HI> and <HI>Gersey</HI> with other small ilands about them, although they be hard vpon the coast of <HI>France,</HI> yet they do belong vnto <HI>Eng∣land. Humfrey Lhoyd</HI> hath so curiously described <HI>England</HI> together with the Antiquities thereof, that others before him may iustlie seeme to be accused of great negligence. Him did <HI>Alexander Neuill</HI> follow in his historie of the Rebellion in <HI>Norffolke,</HI> which he intituleth <HI>Norwicus. Daniel Rogers</HI> my kinsman hath written a booke of the maners, lawes and cu∣stomes of the ancient Brittans. The same author is also about to write of the command and iurisdiction that the Romanes had in <HI>Brittaine.</HI></P>

<HEAD>WALES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He discourse of this prouince, we haue composed out of a certaine fragment of our singular good friend <HI>Humfrey Lhoyd,</HI> which not long since wee caused <HI>Birkman</HI> to imprint, for the benefit of those that are students of Geography. CAMBRIA, saith he, the third part of <HI>Britaine,</HI> is diuided from <HI>Lhoëgria,</HI> (or <HI>England</HI> if you please so to call it) by the riuers <HI>Seuern</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> otherwise it is on all parts confined with the Irish sea (the Geographers commonly call it <HI>Oceanus Vergiuius</HI>) it was so named (as they dreame) of <HI>Camber,</HI> the third sonne of <HI>Brute.</HI> The Welshmen call it <HI>Cymri,</HI> the English <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Latin WALLIA. This part only of this whole Brittish iland doth stil enioy the most an∣cient inhabitants being indeed the true naturall Brittans: and do yet retaine the Brittish tongue, and cannot speake one word of English, which is a language made especially of the misture of the Dutch and French tongues. <HI>Wales</HI> they do at this time diuide into three prouinces, <HI>Venedoth, Powis-land,</HI> and <HI>Dehenbarth.</HI> Vnder <HI>Venedoth</HI> the ile <HI>Anglesey,</HI> (famous long since, and accounted for the ancient seat of the <HI>Druides,</HI>) is conteined. The inhabitants in course of life and fashion of apparell do follow the English: and are an idle people not willing to labour or take pains, bragging much of their gentilitie, and do giue themselues rather to the seruice of Noblemen and to follow the court, than to trades and occupations. Heere hence it is that you shall find few Noblemen through out all <HI>England,</HI> which hath not the greatest part of his followers &amp; seruants (in which thing Englishmen do surpasse any other nation whatsoeuer) Welshmen borne: for being men that are fed with whitmeats or butter &amp; cheese, they haue nimble &amp; able bodies, fit for any maner of seruice. Moreouer being men of haughty minds, and in extreme penury and beggery challenging vnto themselues to be nobly descended, they delight rather to go brauein apparell (like vnto the Spaniard) then to get goods or pamper their bellies, and do soone learne courtlike behauiour, and therefore they are of the English Nobility for ser∣uice preferred before the English. Yet of late heere they haue vsed themselues to dwell in cities, to learn occupations, to trade as merchants, to go to plough, and to do any maner of businesse good for the common-wealth as well as the En∣glish: nay in this thing they excell them, that there is no man so poore amongst them, but for a while will set his sonnes to schole to learne to write and read, and those whom they find to be apt, they send to the Vniuersities, &amp; cause them for the most part to giue their minds to the study of the ciuill law: Heere hence it is that the greater part of those, which in this kingdome doe professe the Ciuill or Canon law, are Welshmen borne. You shall find also very few of the common and meaner sort of people but can read and write his owne language, and after their fashion play vpon the Welsh harpe. Now also they haue the Bible, and common praier booke printed in their owne tongue, a language, as we said, vsed of their ancestors and wholly different from the English. And as in old time long since be∣ing a people (as <HI>Tacitus</HI> reporteth) impatient of the least wrongs that might be offered, they were alwaies together by the eares and cutting one anothers throates; so now for feare of law, (to which they are more obedient, then any other nation) they will wrangle and contend one with another, as long as they are worth a groate. These few obseruations we haue gleaned out of <HI>Lhoyd,</HI> to whom we send the Reader that desireth more of the particulars of this country. <HI>Sylue∣ster Gerrard,</HI> a Welshman hath described <HI>VVales</HI> in a seuerall treatise. Read also the Iournall of <HI>VVales.</HI> Moreouer <HI>VVilliam</HI> of <HI>Newbery</HI> in the 5. chap. of his 2. booke hath many things of the nature of this country, &amp; maners of the people. To these you may adioine <HI>Polyd. Virg.</HI> &amp; those things which <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> hath written in the summe of his 2. booke, <HI>de re Gallica.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Cymri,</HI> or (as the English call it) <HI>VVales</HI> belongeth (that we may heere by the way say something of this) by an ancient decree, to the King of Englands eldest sonne, or daughter if he faile, to the Kings heire, I meane, who is to suc¦ceed next after him: and he is called assoone as he is born, <HI>The Prince of VVales:</HI> and that in the same sense, as in <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Portugall</HI> they call the Kings heire, The Prince; and in <HI>France,</HI> The Dolphin.</P>
<P><HI>Ieffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> writeth, that in these parts of <HI>VVales</HI> neere the riuer of <HI>Seuern,</HI> there is a poole which the country peo∣ple call, <HI>Linligune.</HI> This, saith he, when the sea floweth into it, enterteineth the waters like a bottomlesse gulfe, and so drinketh vp the waues that it is neuer full, nor euer runneth ouer. But when the sea ebbeth, the waters which before it had swallowed do swell like a mountaine, which then do dash and run ouer the banks. At which time if all the people of that shire should stand any thing neere the poole, with their faces toward it, so that the water shall but dash into their clothes and apparell, they shall hard be able to auoid the danger, but that they shalbe drawne into the poole. But if ones backe shalbe toward it, there is no danger at all, although he should stand vpon the very edge of the same. This is the story, I haue nam'd the authour, let him approue the truth of the same. Of <HI>Mona</HI> the iland vpon the shore of this country thou hast the opinion of <HI>Humfrey Lhoyd</HI> in his epistle which we haue adioined to the end of this booke. Of this also <HI>Iohn Leland</HI> in his <HI>Genethliacon</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>VVales,</HI> thus writeth: <HI>This Iland saith hee, being conquered by the English, changed the name, and was called</HI> Anglesey, <HI>that is; the iland of Englishmen.</HI> Polydore Virgill, <HI>a man of great reading, and good iudgement in many matters, is of another opinion. Hee laboureth with all his forces to proue</HI> Menauia <HI>to be</HI> Mona. <HI>If the name, which yet it retaineth: If the citie</HI> Caernaruon, <HI>which is ouer against it vpon the maine, do take his denomination from hence and is called</HI> Aruon <HI>for</HI> Ar-mon: <HI>If that same very short cut ouer, of which the Roman writers do speake: If the nesse or promontorie</HI> Pen-mon, <HI>that is, as the word signifieth, The head of</HI> Mon: <HI>If the huge bodies of trees, and rootes couered ouer with sand, which daily are digged out of the shore of</HI> Tir-mon: <HI>If the firre-trees of maruailous length, which in squally grounds are heere and there found within the earth in this Iland, do not sufficiently proue that that was anciently called</HI> Mona, <HI>which now we call</HI> Anglesey, <HI>I know not what to say more then that I haue read this in the</HI> 14. <HI>booke of</HI> Cornelius Tacitus <HI>his Annales,</HI> Excisi{que} luci saeuis superstitionibus sacri, &amp;c. <HI>Felling the woods consecrated to superstitious seruices, &amp;c. The same</HI> Leland <HI>in another place hath these verses of this Iland:</HI>
<Q><LG>

<L><HI>Quondam terra ferax nemorum, nunc indiga siluae,</HI></L>

<HEAD>IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>RELAND, which the Greekes and Latines call HIBERNIA, others IVERMA and IERNA, the Irish them∣selues call <HI>Eryn.</HI> From hence strangers, taking it from the mouth of the English, which pronounce <HI>e,</HI> the second vowell with the same sound that other nations do sound <HI>i,</HI> the third vowell, haue made, as it seemeth <HI>Irynlandt,</HI> compounded, as is apparent, of the Irish <HI>Erin,</HI> and the Saxon or Dutch <HI>Landt,</HI> which after∣ward was contracted, for more commodity of speach and roundnesse of pronunciation, into <HI>Irland,</HI> from whence the Latines framed IRLANDIA. The first inhabitants which seated themselues in this Iland came hither, as may be easily demonstrated from <HI>Brittaine</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> not from <HI>Spaine,</HI> as some most absurdly haue written. For the abridgement of <HI>Strabo</HI> doth flatly call these ilanders, <HI>Britaines:</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> saith that <HI>Irin</HI> is a part of <HI>Britaine:</HI> wherefore it was iustly of all old writers called, INSVLA BRITANNIA, One of the Brittish iles. About the yeare of CHRIST, 400. in the daies of <HI>Honorius</HI> and <HI>Arcadius</HI> the Em∣perours, at what time the Roman Empire began to decline, the Scottes, a second nation entered <HI>Ireland,</HI> and planted themselues as <HI>O∣rosius</HI> writeth, in the North parts, whereupon it was of them called, SCOTLAND. <HI>Syluester Gyraldus Cambrensis</HI> about 400. yeares since described this Iland in a seuerall treatise. But because that this booke as yet is not set forth and therefore not common and euery where to be gotten, we will out of it gather so much as this narrow roome may conteine, not doubting but we shall worthily deserue great thankes at the readers hand for the same. Listen therefore to his words:</P>
<P><HI>Ireland,</HI> next after <HI>England</HI> the greatest Iland of the knowne world, hath the greater <HI>Britaine</HI> vpon his East side, vpon the West on∣ly lieth the vast and wide Ocean; on the North three daies saile from the coast of <HI>Ireland</HI> lieth <HI>Island,</HI> of all the Northren iles by far the greatest. <HI>Britaine</HI> is almost twice as great as <HI>Ireland:</HI> for seeing that the length of both runneth the same way from South to North; that is, about 800. miles long, and about 200. miles broad: this from <HI>Brendam</HI> hilles to the iles <HI>Columbine</HI> otherwise called <HI>Thorach,</HI> is about eight daies iourney, that is 400. miles long at the least. <HI>Ireland</HI> conteineth in all 176. Canweds. The word <HI>Canwed</HI> is a compound word, vsed aswell of the Welch as Irish, and signifieth a circuite of ground conteining within it 100. villages.</P>
<P>The soile of <HI>Ireland</HI> is vneuen, full of hilles and dales, soft and squally, full of woods, bogges and fennes. Vpon the toppes of the highest and steepest hilles you shall oft find great ponds and bogges: yet it hath in some places most goodly plaines and champion, but in respect of the woods they are very little. The ground is very fatte, and fertile for Corne. The mountaines abound with sheepe, the woods are full of Deere: and the whole ile generally is better for pasture, then for eareable ground, much better I meane, for grasse then corne. For the kernelles of wheat are heere so dwined and small, that they may hardly be dressed with any manner of fanne. That which the Spring-time doth bring forth and flourisheth for a while in Summer, the dripping and watery Autumne will hardly suffer kindly to ripen or tidily to be inn'd. For this Iland is more subiect to blustering winds, outragious stormes of raine and floods, then any other country vnder the cope of heauen. It is very rich of honie and milke. <HI>Solinus</HI> and <HI>Isidore</HI> affirme that it hath no Bees: but by their leaue if they had more diligently examined the matter, they might haue on the contrarie written, that it wanteth vines, but is not altogether void of Bees. For this Iland neither now hath, nor euer had any vines: But of Bees it hath, (as any other country) great plenty: which notwithstanding would heere, as I thinke, swarme in farre greater number, if it were not for the venemous and sowre ewgh-trees which in all places of the Iland do grow in great abundance.</P>
<P>The Iland is euery where crossed and watered with many goodly riuers; of which the principall are these: <HI>Auenliss,</HI> runneth by <HI>Dublin: Boand</HI> (or <HI>Boine</HI>) through <HI>Methe: Banna,</HI> through <HI>Vlster: Linne,</HI> by <HI>Connagh: Moad,</HI> by <HI>Kenelcunill, Slechey,</HI> and <HI>Samayr: Mo∣darn</HI> and <HI>Furne,</HI> by <HI>Keneleon:</HI> There are also very many other riuers, whereof some issuing forth of the bowels of the earth and from their cleare fountaines, other immediatly rushing forth of lakes and fennes wandring heere and there diuide and part the Iland into ma∣ny goodly prouinces and shires. For vnder the foot of <HI>Bladina</HI> hill (now called <HI>Bliew Blemy</HI>) three famous riuers do arise, commonly called, <HI>The three Sisters,</HI> (for they beare the names of three sisters:) <HI>Berne, (Birgus,</HI> now <HI>Barrow</HI>) which runneth by <HI>Lechlin: Eoyr, Ne∣orus,</HI> they call it <HI>Nore,</HI> by <HI>Ossire:</HI> and <HI>Swyre,</HI> by <HI>Archfine</HI> and <HI>Trebagh;</HI> neere <HI>Waterford</HI> they kindly salute one another, and so falling into one channell they quietlie toward the sea. <HI>Slane,</HI> runneth by <HI>Wexford: Boand,</HI> by <HI>Meath: Auenmore,</HI> by <HI>Lismore:</HI> and <HI>Simen,</HI> by <HI>Limiricke.</HI> And indeed amongst all the riuers of <HI>Ireland, Sinnen</HI> bear'th the bell, not only for his goodly greatnesse, long and diuers wandrings through the country, but also his great plenty of dainty fish. For it ariseth out of a very large and goodly lake, which diui∣deth <HI>Connagh</HI> from <HI>Munster,</HI> and spreadeth it selfe into two branches running two contrary waies: one of them tending toward the South, passeth by the city <HI>Kelleloe,</HI> and then enclosinge round the citie <HI>Limiricke,</HI> with a direct course and large streame for an hundred miles and vpward, running between the two mountaines, emptieth it selfe into the <HI>Brendan</HI> sea. The other not much lesse then the for∣mer, diuiding <HI>Meath</HI> and the farther parts of <HI>Vlster</HI> from <HI>Connagh,</HI> running with a crooked course turning this way and that way, at last hideth it selfe in the Northren ocean: So that this riuer doth separate the fourth and West part of the Iland from the other three, like a midland streame running from sea to sea. For this Iland in former ages was diuided almost into fiue equall parts, namely into <HI>North Mounster, South Mounster, Leinster,</HI> and <HI>Connagh.</HI></P>
<P>This country hath diuers goodly Lakes. The sea coast aboundeth plentifully with all maner of sea-fish on all sides: the Riuers and Lakes are stored with great variety of fresh-fishes: especially with these three sorts, Salmons, Trouts, and Eeles. The riuer <HI>Shynen</HI> swarmeth with Lampreyes. But there are wanting many other sorts of good fresh-fish of other countries, as Pikes, Perches, Gogeons, and almost such fish as come not from the sea or salt waters. On the contrary the Lakes of this Iland haue three kinds of fish, which are no where els to be found. For they are somewhat longer and rounder then Trouts, very white fleshed, passing sauery and pleasant, very like vnto the <HI>Hallibut, (Vmbra</HI> our authour calleth it) but that they are much bigger headed. There is another kind very like to herrings, aswell for proportion and bignesse, as also for colour and tast. There are a third sort, in all points like trouts, but that they are not spotted. Yet these sorts of fish are only seen in the Summer, in the Winter they neuer appeare. In <HI>Meath,</HI> neere <HI>Foner</HI> are three Lakes not farre distant one from another, ech of which hath certaine fish proper to it selfe, not found in any of the other two; neither do they I meane, euer come one at another, although there be most conuenient passages by reason of the riuer which runneth from one to another: nay if it shall chance that the fish of one lake be caried to another, either it dieth within a while after, or returneth vnto his own lake againe.</P>
<P>This Iland breedeth greater store of Falcons, Hobbies, and sparrow-hawkes, then any other countrie whatsoeuer. Heere Eagles are as common, as kites are in other countries: and they flocke together in such companies, that oft times you shall find an hundred in one companie. Heere are also great store of those fowles which they call <HI>Bernacles,</HI> which nature bringeth forth in a strange and woonder∣full maner: they are like the wild goose, but somewhat lesse. For they are bredde of the firre blocks, which are tossed along by the shore in this maner: First vpon the blocks you shall see as it were a certaine gelly: then the reeds and other sea-weeds staying the logges, being inclosed in shels, (for the better fashioning and safe preseruing of them) they hang by the billes, vntill in processe and continuance of time they wax of a competent bignesse, and be couered with feathers, either they fall into the water, or by the benefit of their wings they lift vp themselues aloft into the open aire. I my selfe haue many times and often seene with these same eies many very small bodies, of these kind of birds hanging vpon on blocke on the sea coast, enclosed in shells and fully fashioned. These tread not as other fowles do, they ley no egges, they neuer sitte. And therefore in certaine places of <HI>Ireland</HI> in Lent and vpon other fasting daies, it is lawfull to eat these fowles, as if they were not flesh, nor come of flesh. There are also heere great store of a kind of fowle of a doubtfull shape, or dou∣ble nature, which they call an <HI>Aurifrise,</HI> lesse then an Eagle, but greater then a hawke, hauing vpon one foot sharp talants, clouen and griping: the other whole footed, not made to cletch or carry any thing, but only fit for swimming; a strange and admirable worke of sporting nature. Heere are certein birds which they call Martiners, lesse then a blacke bird, cut tail'd like quails, but differing from them in this that their bellies are white and their backs blacke. A strange thing it is to tell of these birds: that if they being dead shalbe kept

<PB REF="34"/> in a drie place, they will neuer stinke: and being laid amongst apparell or other woollen things they will keepe them safe from the moth. And that which is much more admirable, being dead and hang'd vp in some drie place, euery yeare they shed their old feathers, and new come vp in their stood. In the North part of <HI>Ireland</HI> they haue great store of Swans. Storks through out all the Ile are very rare, and those which they haue are blacke. They haue no Partridges, Phesants, Magge-pies nor Nightingales. It hath almost all kind of wild beasts. The Stagges beere are so fatte, that they are scarcely able to runne: and those which are the least amongst them in bignesse of body, do excell others in statelinesse and goodly branching of their hornes. We neuer in any place saw greater plenty of Bores. They haue also many hares, badgers, and weasils. The bodies of their cattell, beasts, deere, and fowles, are in their kind lesse then in other places. Hallow deere, goates and hedgehogs they haue none at all; as also Moles, or if any, they are very rare: but of mice they haue such infinite plenty, as no where more. Of wolues and foxes they haue many; but no maner of venemous creatures. For the Spiders and Nents heere are neither venemous nor hurtfull. The country is neuer shaken with Earth-quakes, and scarce once in a yeare shall on heare it thunder.</P>
<P>From these naturall things let vs passe vnto those strange wonders which nature worketh in these out-countries of the world. In North <HI>Mounster</HI> there is a lake wherein are two Ilands, a greater and a lesse: the greater hath a Church, the lesser a Chappell. Into the Greater neuer any woman, or liuing creature of the female kind might euer come, but it would die by and by. This was often proued by bitches, cattes, and other creatures of that sex. In the lesser no man did euer die, or could die of a naturall death. In <HI>Vlster</HI> there is another Lake in which there is an Iland of two diuers qualities; one part of it hauing a church consecrated to the seruice of Christianity is very beautifull, goodly and pleasant. The other very rough, ouer growne and vnpleasant, is said to be bequeathed to Diuels and euill spirits. This part hath in it nine caues or trenches, in any of which if a man do chance to sleepe all night, he is presently assaulted by the euill spirits, and all the night so greeuously tormented and vexed, that by the morning hee shall scarce be able to breath and will be almost halfe dead. This place is called of the country people, <HI>The purgatory of S. Patricke.</HI> There is also a spring or fountaine in <HI>Moun∣ster,</HI> with whose water if any man shall wash himselfe, he will presently become hoary or gray-headed. I my selfe saw a man who wa∣shed the one halfe of his beard with this water, and the haire became white, the other remaining blacke as it was before. On the con∣trary there is in <HI>Vlster</HI> a fountaine, in which if any man wash his haire, he shall neuer be horay or gray-headed. In <HI>Connagh</HI> there is a fountaine of fresh water vpon the toppe of a very high mountaine, which ebbeth twise in 24. houres, and floweth as oft, in this imita∣ting the vnconstant motion of the sea. There is a fountaine in the farder and North part of <HI>Vlster,</HI> which by reason of the great cold∣nesse of it, in seuen yeares space turneth sticks and wood cast into it, into stone. In <HI>Connagh</HI> there is a fountaine only kind and wholesome for men: but for cattell and other such kind of bruite beasts pestilent and dangerous. There is a fountaine in <HI>Mounster,</HI> which if any man shall touch, by and by the whole country wilbe ouerflowed by storms of raine.</P>
<P>The people of this countrie do weare course blacke mantles or rugges (for the sheep of this Iland are blacke) and they put them on as rudely and vnhandsomely. They vse also little hoods which hang down to their shoulders. In riding they vse no saddles, boots, nor spurres: but with a rod sharpe and tapered at one end, they pricke forward their horses, and make them runne. Their bridles are such as do serue both for bitte and reigne, so made as their horses only vsed to grasse, are neuer hindred from eating. They go into the field to warre, naked and altogether vnarmed. They vse three kind of weapons, long speares, darts, and battell-axes. The people is wild and very vnciuill: they delight in nothing more then to liue idly, and libertie they preferre before great riches. I only obserued the people to delight much in musicall instruments and in that to deserue some commendation. These briefly we haue gleaned heere and there out of the historie of <HI>Gyraldus Cambrensis,</HI> diligently retaining the tenor of his owne phrase: which we haue thought good to translate word for word as they are deliuered by our Authour, that succedent ages might see, either the credulous simplicity of former times, or how time doth alter countries, people and maners of men. And because we haue spoken before of <HI>S. Patricks</HI> purgatory, it shall not be amisse to adde to those former this discourse of it, taken out of the twelfth booke of <HI>Caesarius,</HI> his historie of Things worth the remem∣bring. When as S. <HI>Patricke,</HI> saith he, conuerted this nation to Christianity, and they made a doubt and beleeued not that men should be punished for their sinnes in the world to come, hee by earnest praier obtained this place at the hand of God: the maner of the place is thus: There is a deepe pit or trench, enclosed round with a wall; there are also certaine Regular Canons: No man is so great a sinner, to whom they enioine any greater penance, then to abide all one whole night in that purgatorie. If any man be desirous to enter in, first, making his confession, they administer the sacrament vnto him, they anoint him, perfume him and instruct him, thus: Thou shalt see this night say they, the assaults of the Deuill, and the horrible paines of hell, but they shall not hurt thee, if thou haue but the name of Iesus alwaies in thy mouth: But if thou shalt yeeld to the flattering enticements, or terrible threatnings of the Deuill, and so shalt cease to call vpon the name of Iesus, thou art surely but a dead man. Then in the euening putting him into the pit, they shut vp the dore, and comming againe in the morning, if they presentlie find him not, they looke no farther for him. Many haue died there, and many haue gone home againe, whose visions haue been written of the foresaied friers, and are shewed to such as are desirous to see them.</P>
<P><HI>IReland,</HI> saith M. <HI>Camden,</HI> according to maners of the people, is diuided into <HI>The wild Irish,</HI> and <HI>The English pale:</HI> but according to the ancient iurisdicti∣ons and naturall situation of it, it is more fitly diuided into fiue parts, (and indeed it once conteined fiue kingdomes) <HI>Mounster</HI> in the South, <HI>Leinster</HI> in the East, <HI>Connagh</HI> in the West, <HI>Vlster</HI> in the North, and <HI>Methe</HI> almost in the middest and heart of the land. MOVNSTER, <HI>Memomia,</HI> the Irish call it <HI>Mown,</HI> (sometime diuided into West <HI>Mounster,</HI> which in <HI>Ptolemeys</HI> time the <HI>Gangani, Luceni, Velabri</HI> and <HI>Iterni</HI> did inhabit: and East <HI>Mounster,</HI> posses∣sed then of the <HI>Vodiae,</HI>) comprehendeth now these seuen Shires; <HI>Kerry, Limiricke, Corke, Tiparary, Holy crosse, Waterford,</HI> and <HI>Desmond.</HI> Of which <HI>Kerry</HI> and <HI>Tipararie</HI> were sometimes county Palatines. LEINSTER, <HI>Lagenia,</HI> (they call it <HI>Leighnigls</HI>) a fertile soile, and holesome seat, possessed sometime by the <HI>Brigantes, Coriondi, Menapij, Cauci</HI> and part of the <HI>Eblani.</HI> Now it is diuided into these counties, <HI>Wexford, Caterlogh, Kilkenny, Dublin, Kildare, The Kings county, The Queenes county, Longford, Fernes,</HI> &amp; <HI>Wicklo.</HI> METHE, (<HI>Media,</HI> the Irish call it <HI>Mijh,</HI> in the mid'st almost of the country,) the other part of the an∣cient possessions of the <HI>Eblani,</HI> for his great fertility, either for corn or grasse, fish or flesh, pleasant situation &amp; healthful aire, multitude of people, strength of castels and towns, commonly called, as <HI>Bartholomeys</HI> English reporteth, <HI>The chamber of Ireland,</HI> was lately diuided into East <HI>Methe</HI> and West <HI>Methe.</HI></P>
<P>CONNAGH, <HI>Connacia,</HI> (they call it <HI>Connaughty</HI>) where long since were seated the <HI>Auteri</HI> and <HI>Nagnatae:</HI> now it containeth these shires, <HI>Clare, Le∣trimme, Gallawey, Rosecomin, Maio, Sligo.</HI> The whole prouince although it be in many places fertile and pleasant, yet it is euery where full of dangerous Bogges, darke Woods, Creeks and Baies, conuenient Stations and Harborough for shippes.</P>
<P>VLSTER, <HI>Vltonia,</HI> (the Irish call it <HI>Cui Gully,</HI> the Welsh <HI>Wltw,</HI>) a large country, euery where full of great Lakes, thicke and huge woods, in some place resonably fruitfull, in others leane and hungry, but in all places greene and pleasant to the eie, and therefore it maintaineth great plenty of cattell. Here in <HI>Ptolemeys</HI> time inhabited the <HI>Voluntij, Darni, Robogdij, Vennicny,</HI> and <HI>Erdini,</HI> at this day it conteineth these shires, <HI>Louth, Down, Anwimme, Monalion, Tiroen, Armagh, Colrane, Donergall, Formanagh</HI> and <HI>Cauen.</HI></P>
<P>On all sides round about <HI>Ireland</HI> in the sea, (as also in the baies, riuers, lakes and fresh water) are heere and there many small ilands, whereof some are fertile, others wast and barren, of which to speake seuerally would require a larger discourse then heere we are allowed.</P>
<P><HI>Coelestinus</HI> Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the yeare of CHRIST, 431. sent into <HI>Britaine Paladius</HI> a Bishop, as <HI>Prosper Aquitanus</HI> writeth, to purge it of the Pelagian he esie, wherewith it was but lately distained: and by this meanes also at the same time, caused Christian religion to be planted in <HI>Ireland. Palladius</HI> died in <HI>Britaine</HI> before he had brought to passe that which he came for; whereupon <HI>Patricke,</HI> a Brittaine, and of kinne to <HI>Martinus Turonensis,</HI> was by <HI>Celestine</HI> put in his place, who with such wonderfull successe did preach the Gospell in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that he conuerted the greatest part of that ile vnto Christianity, that he well deserued the name of <HI>The Irish Apostle.</HI> From hence after that at sundrie times, diuers colonies, if I may so vse the word, of learned and religious men, were sent into sundrie parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and were not only the great patrons and planters of the Gospell there, but founders of Monasteries, cities, and towns, as schooles of that profession. In those bloudy warres of the barbarous Saxons, all scholes of learning in <HI>Brittaine</HI> were shut vp, and all reli∣gion almost wholly banished, so that whosoeuer was desirous of instruction that way, was constrained to seeke for it in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and after these wars en∣ded, those which returned brought with them, not only the Irish letters, (which yet the same charecters common to both nations, do plainly shew) but also liberall arts and sciences, which together with Christianity they taught the Saxons.</P>
<P>To these the Reader may adioine such things as <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntington, Polydore Virgill, William Newbery, Iohn Maior,</HI> and others haue written of this in their seuerall histories. <HI>Daniel Rogers</HI> hath set forth a description of this Iland in verse dedicated to <HI>Thomas Phediger.</HI> And M. <HI>William Camden</HI> in prose hath most exactly described the same in his <HI>Britannia.</HI> But <HI>Richard Stanihurst,</HI> a worthy gentleman this countrie man borne, hath this other day put forth a seueral treatise of the history and state of this iland. <HI>Baptista Boazio</HI> hath described it in a mappe apart by it selfe, dedicated to the late Queene <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> and my good friend M. <HI>Speed,</HI> with no lesse care and diligence hath done the same in his <HI>Imperium Brittannicum,</HI> or Empire of Great <HI>Brittaine,</HI> lately set forth and dedicated to his Highnesse.</P>

<HEAD>The Isles of the AZORES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ome are of opinion, that these Isles situate in the Atlantick or West Ocean, are so named by the Spaniards, from a kinde of Hauks which they call <HI>Azor.</HI> And in the plurall number <HI>Açores.</HI> One writes, but fondlie, that they are so called from the French word <HI>Essorer,</HI> which signifieth to drie or wither. In Latin a man may call them <HI>Accipitrarias,</HI> or the Isles of Hauks, and in Greeke <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Our Netherlanders terme them <HI>De vlaemsche eilanden,</HI> that is, The flemish Islands, because they are thought first to haue beene discouered by certaine Flemish Marchants of <HI>Bruges.</HI> At that time (they said) they could find nothing vpon them but trees (especiallie great store of Cedars) and woods, and foules, of diuers sorts; and thither they sent inhabitants to possesse and manure the said Isles. Afterward they submitted them∣selues to the <HI>Portugales,</HI> vnder whose gouernement they yet remaine. <HI>Lewes Marmolius</HI> fol. 38. reports that they were discouered about the yeare 1455. Vndoubtedly auncient writers knew them not: yet might they name them perhaps. For whether they specified them vnder the name of <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> I cannot be assured.

At the foote of this mountaine Eastward, there is a spring of fresh water, which sometimes dischargeth fierie streames, and stones burning hoat; and that with so great force and violence, that it sends them packing as it were with a current, by steepe and lower places, euen to the sea, whereas of the multitude of these stones is made a promontory or headland commonly called <HI>Misterij.</HI> It is distant from the said fountaine 12. miles. At this present it stretcheth a mile and halfe further into the sea, in regard of the continual increase of this heape of stones.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>PAINE is resembled by <HI>Strabo</HI> vnto an Ox-hide spred vpon the ground. It is around in∣uironed by the sea, saue only where it is diuided from <HI>France</HI> by the Pyreney-mountaines. On the East it hath the said Pyreney-mountaines, which from the Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> or the Promontory stretched foorth neere <HI>Illiberis</HI> (now <HI>Colibre</HI>) runneth along to the British Ocean; and this is the very narrowest part of <HI>Spaine;</HI> insomuch (saith <HI>Vaseus</HI>) that when I trauelled thorow <HI>Biscay,</HI> I remember that from the hill of <HI>S. Adrian,</HI> if my sight deceiued me not, I saw both seas, namely the Ocean neere at hand: and as farre off as I could di∣scerne, the foame-white waues of the Mediterran sea. North it is bounded by the Biscain sea; West, by the Western sea; and South, by the Streight of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and part of the Mediterran sea.</P>
<P><HI>Spaine</HI> is diuided into three Prouinces; <HI>Baetica, Lusitania,</HI> and <HI>Tarraconensis. Baetica</HI> on the North is inclosed with the riuer <HI>Anas,</HI> now called <HI>Guadiana;</HI> West, with that part of the Atlantick Ocean, which is betweene the mouth of <HI>Guadiana,</HI> and the Streight of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> South, with part of the Mediterran sea called of olde <HI>Mare Balearicum,</HI> extending from the Streight last mentioned, to the Promontory of <HI>Charidómus,</HI> now called <HI>Cabo de Gata;</HI> and East∣ward it is bounded by an imaginary line, drawen from the said Promontory by the towne of <HI>Castulo</HI> to the riuer <HI>Guadiana.</HI> It is called <HI>Baetica</HI> of the famous riuer <HI>Baetis</HI> which cuts the whole Prouince in twaine. This riuer sprin∣ging out of the wood or forest anciently called <HI>Saltus Tygensis,</HI> runneth into the Atlantick-ocean, and is at this day called by an Arabian name, <HI>Guadalquibir,</HI> that is to say, The great riuer. This prouince of later times, of the Van∣dal inhabitants, was called <HI>Vandalicia,</HI> &amp; at this present by the same word corrupted <HI>Andaluzia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lusitania conteines Algaruc and the greater part of Portu∣gale.</NOTE> <HI>Lusitania</HI> confineth North vpon the riuer <HI>Duero,</HI> from the very mouth thereof, to the bridge ouer against <HI>Simancas;</HI> West it bordereth vpon that part of the Atlantick-ocean which ebs and flowes betweene the outlets of <HI>Duero</HI> and <HI>Guadiana;</HI> South, vpon <HI>Andaluzia;</HI> and East it fronteth <HI>Hispania Tarraconensis,</HI> now called <HI>Castilia,</HI> &amp;c. euen from the ancient <HI>Oretania</HI> to the foresaid bridge ouer against <HI>Simancas. Lusitania</HI> was thus named from <HI>Lusus</HI> the sonne of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and <HI>Lysa,</HI> one of <HI>Bacchus</HI> his companions: whereupon it is somtimes called of <HI>Lusus, Lusitania;</HI> and somtimes againe of <HI>Lysa, Ly∣sitania.</HI> The residue of <HI>Spaine</HI> pertaineth to the prouince called <HI>Tarraconensis,</HI> of the city <HI>Tarracona</HI> which is the head of all that prouince; a city (saith <HI>Strabo</HI>) most notably fit for princes in their trauels to retire themselues: and here the Emperors kept their chiefe iurisdiction. This prouince containeth the kingdome of <HI>Murcia,</HI> &amp; likewise <HI>Valencia,</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> with <HI>Catalonia,</HI> also <HI>Castilia Vieja,</HI> the kingdome of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> part of <HI>Portugale</HI> between the riuers <HI>Duero,</HI> and <HI>Minho,</HI> the kingdome of <HI>Gallicia, Asturia,</HI> and all <HI>Biscay.</HI> Hitherto <HI>Vaseus</HI> in his chronicle of <HI>Spaine,</HI> who in∣treateth of this argument more at large. Read also <HI>Marinaeus Siculus, Marius Aretius, Damianus a Goës, Francis Taraffa,</HI> the bishop of <HI>Gerundo, Annius Viterbiensis;</HI> and in Spanish <HI>Florian del campo,</HI> and after him <HI>Ambrosio Morales:</HI> with all those other Writers of <HI>Spaine</HI> that <HI>Vaseus</HI> in the fourth chapter of his Chronicle doth recite. <HI>Stephan Garibayo</HI> in his Chronicle of <HI>Spain,</HI> diuided into twenty books, describes the kingdome of <HI>Nauarre. Iohn Mariana</HI> likewise not long since published a volume concerning Spanish matters. Among the ancient Writers you must peruse <HI>Caesar, Stra∣bo,</HI> and the rest, which <HI>Damianus a Goës</HI> in his booke called <HI>Hispania</HI> doth nominate: also the Panegyrick speech of <HI>Latinus Pacatus,</HI> and <HI>Claudianus de laude Serenae.</HI> Vnto these you may adde the first booke of <HI>Laonicus.</HI> There is ex∣tant also a little Trauellers Breuiate written in Spanish by <HI>Alonço de Meneses,</HI> containing almost all the ordinarie voyages in Spaine, wherein also are noted the distances of places.</P>
<P>Three memorable things (as writeth <HI>Nauagierus</HI>) are prouerbially spoken of <HI>Spaine:</HI> the first, A bridge, ouer which the water runneth (whereas it runnes vnder all other bridges) namely the water-conduct at <HI>Segouia:</HI> the second, a city compassed with fire, that is to say, <HI>Madrid,</HI> because the town-walles are of flint: and the third, a bridge, whereon are daily fed ten thousand head of cattel; whereby is signified the riuer <HI>Guadiana,</HI> which hiding it selfe vnder ground for the space of seuen miles, doth then breake forth againe. Albeit this last is a thing sprung rather out of the peoples vulgar opinion, than out of truth; as <HI>Don George</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Harlebeck,</HI> an eye-witnesse most worthy of credit, hath informed me, being a man conuersant in all kinde of history, and a a wonderfull searcher and admirer of naturall Philosophie.</P>
<P>The islands belonging vnto <HI>Spaine,</HI> wherof ancient writers haue made mention, at the Celtick promontory, or Cape Finister, are the <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> which at this present are not to be found in the ocean. Also <HI>Insulae Deorum,</HI> other∣wise called <HI>Cicae,</HI> and of late times <HI>Islas de Bayona: Londobris</HI> named also <HI>Erythia,</HI> and now the <HI>Burlings: Gades</HI> in olde time dedicated to <HI>Hercules,</HI> now commonly called <HI>Cales.</HI> All these are in the Ocean. In the Mediterran sea you haue <HI>Ophiusa</HI> now called <HI>Formentera.</HI> As likewise the two <HI>Gymnesiae,</HI> or <HI>Baleares,</HI> at this present called by distinct names, the one <HI>Maiorca,</HI> and the other <HI>Minorca.</HI> The coast of <HI>Minorca</HI> is beset round about with huge mountaines: but at the entrance of the hauen the roots of these mountaines are leuelled into a plaine, till they meet, at so nar∣row a distance, on the other side of the shore, that no ships can enter the harbor, but with a gentle gale of wind. The hauen is named <HI>Mahon,</HI> being a most beautifull, and commodious place; for it stretcheth almost foure miles in length, with many inlets, all which serue for the harboring of ships. From hence ariseth a perpetuall ridge of mountaines, on which the inhabitants cut downe great plenty of wood. At the vtmost part therof on the moun∣tain-tops is built a city. Contrariwise the greater Island hath a plaine shore, and most high and barren moun∣taines in the middest. A city there is of one and the selfe name with the Island, very large and fairly built. They vse the lawes of the Castilians, and do much resemble them both in language and maners. This description of the isles <HI>Maiorca</HI> &amp; <HI>Minorca</HI> we haue borrowed out of <HI>N. Villagagnon</HI> his discourse of the expedition to <HI>Alger.</HI> Who desires to know more of these isles, and of the inhabitants disposition, may reade <HI>Bernardin Gomez</HI> his sixt and se∣uenth books of the life of <HI>Iames T.</HI> King of <HI>Arragon.</HI> That <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spaine</HI> possesseth the greatest Empire in the world, since the worlds beginning, we haue proued in our Theatre printed in high Dutch.</P>

<HEAD>The Kingdome of PORTVGALE.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>ORTVGALE</HI> is vnproperly called <HI>Lusitania;</HI> for neither is all <HI>Portugale</HI> com∣prehended in <HI>Lusitania,</HI> nor all <HI>Lusitania</HI> in <HI>Portugale:</HI> yet can it not be denied, that the better part of <HI>Lusitania</HI> is subiect to the King of <HI>Portugale. Portugale</HI> is diuided into three regions, <HI>Transtagana,</HI> or that which lies beyond or South of <HI>Tagus,</HI> the riuer of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> as far as <HI>Guadiana; Cistagana</HI> situate on this side or North of <HI>Tagus,</HI> as far as the riuer <HI>Douro;</HI> and <HI>Interamnis. Transtagana</HI> border vpon that part of <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> which from the riuer <HI>Guadiana</HI> extendeth to the limits of <HI>Ca∣stilia Nuoua. Interamnis</HI> I call that which lies between the riuers <HI>Douro</HI> and <HI>Minho,</HI> a region no lesse pleasant than fruitfull. This <HI>Interamnis</HI> or Riuer bounded prouince, is wholly out of the limits of <HI>Lusitania;</HI> vnlesse reiecting the former description, we will rather incline to <HI>Strabo,</HI> who saith that the greatest part of <HI>Lusitania</HI> is inhabited by the <HI>Callaici.</HI> The length of this region is twelue leagues, and the bredth, where it is largest, is twelue leagues also; being in other places but six or foure leagues ouer. And in this so small a portion of ground, besides the Metropolitan church of <HI>Braga,</HI> the Cathedrall of <HI>Porto,</HI> and other fiue Collegiate churches, there are aboue <HI>130.</HI> monasteries, the greater part whereof are endowed with most ample reuenues: and also to the number of <HI>1460.</HI> Parish churches, as one writeth. Certaine it is, that within the peculiar Diocesse of <HI>Braga</HI> there are accounted <HI>800.</HI> Whereby you may easily coniecture both the fruitfulnesse of the soile, and the ancient deuotion of the inhabitants. But of the pleasantnesse what need we speake, whenas within this one prouince are found aboue fiue and twenty thousand springing fountaines; bridges most sumptuously built of square stone almost two hundred; and hauens for shipping to the number of six? These things therefore I thought not vnfit to be remembred, because the goodnesse and woorth of this Prouince is in a maner vnknowen. To the East hereof adioy∣neth the prouince called <HI>Transmontana,</HI> that is to say, on the other side of the mountaines; it aboun∣deth with excellent Wheat, and strong Wine, and containes within it the city <HI>Bragança,</HI> which is the head of a most large Dukedome. Thus much out of <HI>Vaseus. Peter de Medina</HI> reckoneth and nameth in this Kingdome of <HI>Portugale</HI> sixty seuen cities or walled townes.</P>
<P>To the Kingdome of <HI>Portugale</HI> at this present belongeth the Kingdome of <HI>Algarue,</HI> which is no∣thing els, but the South part of the whole Kingdome towards the sea. For the King entitles himselfe <HI>King of Portugale, of Algarue, of Guinie, of Aethiopia, Persia and India.</HI> This Kingdom first began about the yeere <HI>1100.</HI> For vntill then, as also in ancient times, it went altogether vnder the name of <HI>Spaine. Marinaeus</HI> thus writeth of it: One <HI>Henry</HI> Earle of <HI>Loraigne,</HI> a man of most vndoubted valour, comming out of <HI>France</HI> atchieued great exploits against the <HI>Moores.</HI> In regard wherof <HI>Alonso</HI> the sixt, King of <HI>Castile</HI> gaue him in marriage his base daughter called <HI>Tiresia;</HI> and assigned for her dowry part of <HI>Gallicia</HI> contained in the kingdome of <HI>Portugale.</HI> Of this marriage afterwards was born <HI>Alphonsus,</HI> the first King of <HI>Portugale,</HI> he that recouered <HI>Lisbon</HI> from the <HI>Moores.</HI> Who hauing vanquished fiue of their Kings in one battell, left vnto posterity, as a monument of this exploit, his armes consisting of fiue scutchions. <HI>Oliuer à Marca</HI> in his Chronicle published in French, more particularly blazeth the armes of this kingdome. At first he saith, it was a plaine siluer scutchion without any portra∣ture; afterwards in regard of the fiue vanquished kings there were fiue scutchions imposed; and in euery of the fiue scutchions fiue siluer circles, in remembrance of the fiue wounds of our Sauior <HI>CHRIST,</HI> which in time of the battell miraculously appeared vnto <HI>Alphonso</HI> in the skies; or (as others report) for that being wounded with fiue mortall wounds, by the prouidence of Almighty God he escaped death.</P>
<P>Reade also <HI>Ierome Osorius, Marinaeus Siculus,</HI> and <HI>Sebastian Munster.</HI> Of the originall of this Kingdome reade the first chapter of <HI>Iohn Barros</HI> his Decades of <HI>Asia. Athenaeus</HI> in his eighth booke and first chapter writeth somewhat of the fruitfulnesse of this Region, and the excellent tempera∣ture of the aire. <HI>Lisbon</HI> the chiefe city of the Kingdome, <HI>Damianus a Goes</HI> describeth in a peculiar Treatise. Concerning the antiquities of <HI>Portugale</HI> there is a booke written by <HI>Andrew Resende.</HI></P>
<P>The Portugales Dominions at this present are very large; for they extend euen from the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> along all the Sea Prouinces, and the Islands adiacent, as farre as <HI>China,</HI> and the Isles called <HI>Lequios.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Diocesse of SIVILL, being part of ANDALVZIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Diocesse of the Church of <HI>Siuill</HI> is situate in that prouince of <HI>Spaine,</HI> which in rich com∣modities, and a kinde of fruitfull and peculiar brauery excelleth all the rest. This beautifull prouince the ancients, of the riuer <HI>Baetis,</HI> called <HI>Baetica:</HI> but late Writers haue named it <HI>VVandalicia,</HI> or <HI>Andaluzia</HI> of the Vandals, who about a thousand yeres past ouerran the same. The said Diocesse or territory, of all the regions and territories in <HI>Spaine,</HI> is rightly estee∣med the most happy, both in regard of the multitude and ciuility of the inhabitants, and of their riches, and ouerflowing abundance of all things; this being confirmed euen by the verses of the Grecians, who attribute the Elizian pleasures and delights vnto this tract, which bordereth vpon the West Ocean. This territory containeth here &amp; there almost 200. principall townes, besides a great number of villages; so that there are now more townes vnder the iurisdiction of this one diocesse or conuent, than there were of old in all foure together: for (as <HI>Plinie</HI> writeth) they prescribed lawes but only to 175. townes. And how small a number will these seeme to be, if those hundred thousand villages be accounted, which only in the territory of <HI>Siuill,</HI> called by the Arabians <HI>Axarafi,</HI> were by King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> receiued into loyall allegeance together with the city it selfe? which notwithstanding after the departure of the Moores, became the greatest part of them desolate: howbeit the limits of this as they differ much from the ancient precincts of Spa∣nish diocesses; so do they come neerer to the forme prescribed by King <HI>Vamba</HI> vnto all the Cathedrals of <HI>Spaine.</HI> For this diocesse hath on the East the territory of <HI>Corduba;</HI> West the frontiers of <HI>Algarue;</HI> North it lieth ouer a∣gainst that part of <HI>Portugale</HI> which is called The gouernment of <HI>Saint Iago:</HI> but the residue toward the South is in∣closed with the diocesse of <HI>Cadiz</HI> and the Ocean sea. Principall townes here are very many, especially the royall city of <HI>Siuill,</HI> most largely and pleasantly situate vpon the banke of <HI>Baetis,</HI> and enuironed with beautifull and stately walles. This famous riuer <HI>Baetis</HI> or <HI>Guadalquibir</HI> springing out of the forest called in times past <HI>Saltus Tugi∣ensis,</HI> and holding on his course by the chiefe cities of his adopted prouince, doth from this noble city, knowen of olde by the name of <HI>Colonia Romulea,</HI> continue his streames in a chanell nauigable and abounding with fish, to the Westerne Ocean, for the space of threescore miles, the banks on both sides flourishing with Oliuets, Vine∣yards, and most admirable sweet Gardens, perfumed with the delectable and fragrant odour of Citrons.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Siuill</HI> both for churches and houses is the gallantest city in all <HI>Spaine,</HI> and for the neat attire of the Citi∣zens, and a kinde of seemelinesse to them only peculiar, is inferiour to no city in all the world. Here religion, the study of liberall arts and the practise of gentlemanlike exercises are in their prime. And so infinite are the riches and treasures included within the walles of this city, as neuer the like in olde time could be found in any King∣dome or Empire how great soeuer, the Roman only excepted. For this being the richest of all the cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> largely distributes ouer all Christendome that vnspeakable wealth, and before these last times neuer dream't of, which it fetcheth as it were from another world, that from hence was first discouered. Wherewith also it abun∣dantly furnisheth the very barbarous and sauage nations, inhabiting the inmost part of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> It is most apparent, that for certaine yeeres together in the account-books of the <HI>Indies-contractation-house,</HI> there was most faithfully registred an hundred &amp; more millions of gold. So that hence a man may coniecture, that so much more was concealed by those that brought it, for feare lest the King for some certaine time should haue borrowed it. What may we then thinke of the infinit &amp; incredible masse of riches which from their first discouery of <HI>America</HI> till this present, hath hither been transported; two fleets yeerely returning into <HI>Spaine,</HI> laden in a maner with no other kind of merchandise, but gold and siluer, and for the most part balasted with both? But these (you wil say) are forren and far-fetcht commodities. It is so rich therefore of it selfe, that it payes for yeerely tribute vnto the King, to whom it is most loyally deuoted, a million and an halfe of golde: so much as many Princes can scarse raise out of their whole kingdomes. Here reside for traffike innumerable multitudes of strangers, besides whom of late yeres there haue been found 24000 Citizens housholders, diuided into 28. wards. The first of these wards is famous both in regard of the name, and the church of <HI>S. Mary,</HI> than which all Christendome hath not a more excellent, if you consider the large and magnificent building with the beauteous and admirable ornaments, and the steeple likewise of exceeding higth, from whence signes are giuen at certaine houres, wherein stands a lofty pinacle of most curious workmanship, out of which you may behold a most glorious prospect ouer all the city, and the fields adiacent. What should I here describe the royall magnificence of the kings castle; than which the Kings of <HI>Spaine</HI> haue none more gorgeously built, or pleasantly situate? Or to what purpose should I recount the sumptuous palaces of Dukes, Earles and Nobles; or the neat houses of Citizens, with their crystall fountains, greene arbours, and odoriferous gardens? with silence I omit the ancient water-streames disfused by arches tho∣row all parts of the city; and those later ones, which by the infinit cost, and industry of the Senatours &amp; Citizens of <HI>Siuill,</HI> haue for publicke delight beene conueyed to the place commonly called <HI>Hercules pillars;</HI> where by plan∣ting of trees they haue conuerted a large fenny quagmire into a most beautifull groue, leauing faire and broad spaces for men to walke, run, and disport themselues in. Now the gardens without the city, fraught with all vari∣ety of pleasures, and those stately houses in the fields, bordering vpon <HI>Baetis,</HI> who can sufficiently commend? Out of which they may dayly behold ships comming in both from the old and new world. For <HI>Siuill</HI> the queene of the Ocean, being placed as a mediatresse between both, conioines them together by prosperous nauigations, and rich trafficks. Tedious it were to set forth the maiestie of the Kings palace, or of his castle at <HI>Triana.</HI> This <HI>Triana</HI> is a faire suburbe on the farther side of <HI>Baetis,</HI> inhabited almost with three thousand Citizens, and ioyned to the city

<PB REF="42"/> by a bridge of timber. But whoso considers the richnesse and fertility of their fields, abounding with all kinde of graine, may iustly acknowledge it a most bountifull and prodigall worke of nature, which here aboue all other pla∣ces seemes to muster; and distribute her pleasures and treasures for the solace and benefit of mankinde.</P>
<P>Next vnto <HI>Siuill</HI> in authority and greatnesse <HI>Caesariana,</HI> alias <HI>Xeres de la frontiera,</HI> and <HI>Iulia firmitas</HI> now called <HI>Astigi,</HI> which in old times were colonies of the <HI>Romans,</HI> do excell all other townes &amp; cities. <HI>Carmona</HI> and <HI>Vtrera</HI> may well be termed the two granaries and storehouses of <HI>Siuill.</HI> Next followes <HI>Marchena,</HI> called out of ancient stonie monuments, I know not how truly, <HI>Martia Colonia;</HI> and <HI>Arçobriga,</HI> being the lord-ship townes of the most illustrious ducal familie of the <HI>Ponces.</HI> To these you may adde <HI>Vrsao,</HI> called of old <HI>Genua Vrbanorum,</HI> and at this present <HI>Osuna,</HI> the most hono∣rable and rich dukedome of the <HI>Girones,</HI> ennobled with an Vniuersitie. For oile, corne, and wine <HI>Constantina, Caçalla,</HI> and <HI>Maronio</HI> do principally excell: <HI>Nebrisa</HI> likewise situate at the mouth of <HI>Baetis,</HI> the most happie natiue soile of <HI>Aelius Antonius,</HI> the restorer and author of the Latin tongue in <HI>Spaine,</HI> is famous for antiquity, and inferiour to none in plenty of Corne. Also in the very bay whereinto <HI>Baetis</HI> dischargeth his streames, vpon the headland called of old <HI>Luciferi Promontorium,</HI> stands the towne which we now call <HI>Solucar</HI> or <HI>Sant lucar,</HI> the rich mart-towne of the <HI>Gothish Dukes,</HI> and very commodious for the west-Indan fleets. Other principall townes of this Diocesse for breuities sake I omit.</P>
<P>The soile in all this tract is most miraculously plentifull of wheat, wine, and oile, and of all kinde of graine, where∣with it supplieth remote and forrein countreies: and how deseruedly might <HI>Plinie</HI> haue preferred this part before <HI>Italie,</HI> had not he, an Italian, caried a greater affection to his owne countrey? yet <HI>Spaine</HI> by him: wheresoeuer it borders vpon the sea, is commended: which praise of his we vnderstand especially of that part of <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> which pertaines to the Diocesse of <HI>Siuill,</HI> because it lies open to the maine Ocean, and to the gentle blasts of the west. The skie here is most fauourable, smiling alwaies with a temperate and most amiable aspect: the people borne to piety and good arts, excelling in sharpnesse of wit, and surpassing others in a bold kinde of courage and towardlinesse of minde (which is in a manner peculiar, and hereditary to this nation) will in no case suffer themselues either in offices of curtesie, or in exploit of warre, to be excelled by any nation.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of <HI>Siuill,</HI> next that of <HI>Toledo,</HI> is the highest prelacy in all <HI>Spaine;</HI> whilome it had eleuen suffragan Bishops, as appeareth out of the subscriptions of councells: namely, the Bishop of <HI>Corduba,</HI> who now is vnder the Iurisdiction of <HI>Toledo:</HI> The B. of <HI>Iliberis,</HI> who after the expulsion of the <HI>Moores,</HI> remoued to the Metropolitan sea of <HI>Granada:</HI> The B. of <HI>Ilipa</HI> or <HI>Elepla,</HI> of late called <HI>Pennaflor,</HI> which towne is now destitute of a B. sea, and subscribes to the authority of the church of <HI>Siuill.</HI> The Bishopricke of <HI>Tuccitan,</HI> now called <HI>Martos,</HI> and in old time <HI>Augusta Gemella Colonia,</HI> at this present destitute of a B. and vnder the Iurisdiction of <HI>Gienna.</HI> The Bishopricke of <HI>Malaga,</HI> which now is suffragan to <HI>Siuill.</HI> The Bishopricke of <HI>Aegabria,</HI> now called <HI>Cabra:</HI> it hath no prelate, but belongeth to the church of <HI>Corduba.</HI> The bishopricke of <HI>Asindia</HI> or <HI>Asidonia,</HI> now called <HI>Medina Sidonia,</HI> subiect to the B. of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> the episcopall sea being remoued from <HI>Gadisea,</HI> others call it <HI>Asidonia;</HI> it is now said to stand not farre from that place, where <HI>Xeres</HI> is situate; vnlesse you will say, that in the same tract it retained one and the selfe-same name. It had also the Bishop∣ricke of <HI>Ossonoba</HI> nere <HI>Pharo</HI> a towne in <HI>Algarue,</HI> the Moores named it <HI>Eruba,</HI> afterwards it was incorporated into the church of <HI>Siluis,</HI> which before being a member of <HI>Siuill,</HI> was by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third made Suffragan to <HI>Euora,</HI> which himselfe had aduanced to a Metropolitan sea. The bishopricke of <HI>Abdera,</HI> which was translated to the sea of <HI>Almeria,</HI> and is now Suffragan to <HI>Granada.</HI> The bishopricke of <HI>Astigi,</HI> which now is ingraffed into the church of <HI>Siuill.</HI> The bi∣shopricke of <HI>Italica,</HI> seated in a most noble colonie of the Romans not only citizens, but also Emperors &amp; Generals, which standing six miles from <HI>Siuill,</HI> on the other side <HI>Baetis,</HI> was in ancient times, when <HI>S. Gerontius</HI> the martyr was bi∣shop, a place highly reuerenced. Out of this towne sprang <HI>Traianus, Hadrian,</HI> and <HI>Theodosius,</HI> three great and renow∣med Emperors. It is commonly called Old <HI>Siuill,</HI> the vast ruines thereof being now scarse extant, a wofull spectacle of the mutability of humane things, by so much the more to be lamented, in that the forlorne fragments of that most beautifull and large <HI>Amphitheatrum,</HI> which now lie scattered and disiointed, renew a more sad memory of the ancient greatnesse and magnificence.</P>
<P>At this time the Archbishop of <HI>Siuill</HI> hath for suffragans the bishops of <HI>Malaga,</HI> of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and of the <HI>Canary-isles.</HI> The maiesty, dignity &amp; wealth of this church we cannot in few words decypher. Sufficeth that we do gather out of their own audits &amp; accounts, that the archbishops yerely reuenues amount to aboue 100000. duckets. The princi∣pall of the church vnder him haue cleerely more than 30000: the whole society of the church is allowed 120000. which are diuided among 40. Canons, 11. priuileged priests, 20. fellow-portionaries or pensioners, and so many halfe-pensioners; yet so, as the Canons and priuileged priests haue such daily allowance, as by the yeere comes to 2000. duckats a man, the pensioners haue lesse than so much by a fourth part, and the halfe-pensioners are allowed only a third part. Next vnto the Archbishop the greatest authority remaines in the Deane, whose dignity is estee∣med worth 5000. duckats a yeere. Besides, here are in this church 20. masse-priests, which from their number we call <HI>Vicenarios;</HI> who for their nightly and daily orizons, are allowed euery day amongst them all 200. duckats and a∣boue: also there are 200. other priests, who out of their priuate chapels do raise stipends sufficient for their mainte∣nance. Rich benefices in this diocesse there are to the number of 600, many whereof are valued at 1000. some at 2000. duckats by the yeere: and of lesser cures, which are called chapels or chanteries, almost 2000. Here are like∣wise many cloisters of monks and nunnes, wherein their religion and the study of their diuinity flourisheth, most of them in yeerely reuenues being able to dispend 6000. duckats. There stands a monastery of Carthusians most sumptuously built vpon the banke of <HI>Baetis</HI> within view of <HI>Siuill,</HI> which hath 25000. duckats by the yeere. Long it were to recken vp all their hospitals, whenas within <HI>Siuill</HI> only there are aboue 120. very richly indowed, many with 8000. and some with 15000. duckats of yerely income. Thus much of this region or diocesse, out of the relation of <HI>Don Francisco Pacheco.</HI> Concerning <HI>Siuill</HI> and the territory thereto adiacent you may reade at large in the Iournall of <HI>Nauagierus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Kingdome of VALENTIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Tolemey</HI> calles the people inhabiting this part of <HI>Hispania Tarraconensis, Heditanos. Plinie</HI> names the region <HI>Edetania.</HI> It seemes that in <HI>Strabo</HI> they are called <HI>Sidetani,</HI> and in <HI>Liuy, Sedetani. (Plinie</HI> also mentions the people <HI>Sede∣tanos,</HI> and the region <HI>Sedetania,</HI> but diuers from these; as appeareth out of his third booke and third chapter.) In this tract stands the city of <HI>Valentia,</HI> albeit <HI>Ptole∣mey</HI> ascribes it to the <HI>Cotestani,</HI> a nation bordering not farre off. From this city, as from the principall, all the whole region is denominated, and it containes the ancient <HI>Hedetania, Cotestania,</HI> and part of <HI>Ilercaonia.</HI> This prouince put on the title of a kingdome, about the yeere of our Lord <HI>788.</HI> as you may reade in <HI>Peter de Medina,</HI> and <HI>Peter Antonie Beuthero.</HI></P>
<P>It is situate vpon the Mediterran sea, and is refreshed with the streames of <HI>Turia,</HI> a riuer so called by <HI>Salust, Priscian,</HI> and <HI>Vibius:</HI> by <HI>Pomponius Mela, Durias,</HI> and by <HI>Plinie, Turium.</HI> Now they call it <HI>Guetalabiar,</HI> which is an Arabicke name imposed by the Moores, and in English is as much to say, as pure and cleare water. It is a riuer not very deepe; but in regard of the euerflourishing banks, be∣decked with roses and sundry kinds of flowers, most exceeding pleasant. It is on both sides from the very fountaine to the outlet, naturally clad with beautifull and shadie woods: euery where you may behold the Withy, the Plane, the Pine-tree, and other trees, neuer disrobed of their leaues: so that <HI>Claudian</HI> wrote most truly of it; <HI>Faire</HI> Duria, <HI>with flowers and rosie banks adorn'd.</HI> There is also the riuer <HI>Sucro,</HI> which by a new name they call <HI>Xucar.</HI> Two hilles here are among the rest, one called <HI>Mariola,</HI> and the other <HI>Pennagolosa,</HI> that is, The rocke of dainties; wherunto from other places resort great store of Herbalists &amp; Physicians: for vpon these hilles grow great abundance of very rare plants and herbs. They haue also a siluer-mine at a place called <HI>Buriol,</HI> in the way from <HI>Valentia</HI> to <HI>Tortosa.</HI> In a place likewise named <HI>Aioder</HI> are found certaine stones interlaced with golden veines. At Cape <HI>Fini∣strat</HI> there are yron-mines, and so are there by <HI>Iabea.</HI> About <HI>Segorbia,</HI> there is yet mention of a quar∣rey, from whence Marble was wont to be conueyed to <HI>Rome.</HI> In <HI>Picacent</HI> they dig Alabaster, and all the countrey ouer Allume, Oker, Lime, and Plaister in great abundance. But the greatest riches of this countrey consisteth in earthen vessels, which they call Porcellan: which may perhaps be the same that ancient Writers call <HI>Vasa Murrhina.</HI> These are made in diuers places of this kingdome so curiously, and with such arte, as the best Porcellans in <HI>Italie,</HI> (whereof in all countreys such reckening is made) can hardly be preferred before them. Who desires to know more of the excellency of this region, and how fertile it is of all things, especially of Sugar, Wine and Oile; let him reade the <HI>9. 12.</HI> and <HI>13.</HI> books written by <HI>Bernardine Gomez,</HI> concerning the life of <HI>Iames</HI> the first, King of <HI>Aragon.</HI></P>
<P>Among the cities of this kingdome, <HI>Valentia</HI> is the principall, and the sea of a bishop; which bishop (as <HI>Marinaeus Siculus</HI> and <HI>Damianus a Goes</HI> do report) may dispend <HI>13000.</HI> duckats by the yeere. Amongst all the Valentias of <HI>Europe,</HI> this (saith <HI>Bernardin Gomez</HI>) is called by the French, <HI>Valen∣tia</HI> the great: for it containeth <HI>12000.</HI> houses, besides the suburbs &amp; gardens, which haue as many hou∣ses almost as the city it selfe. <HI>Peter de Medina</HI> writeth, that in this city there are aboue <HI>10000.</HI> welles of fountaine water. An exact description thereof you may reade in <HI>Iohn Mariana</HI> his <HI>12.</HI> booke and <HI>19.</HI> chap. It is so beautifull, as the Spaniards in a common prouerbe say, Rich <HI>Barçelona,</HI> Plentifull <HI>Sara∣goça,</HI> and Faire <HI>Valentia. Plinie</HI> cals it a colonie of the Romans. He saith, it is three miles distant from the sea. That this city of ancient time was called <HI>Roma</HI> of <HI>Romus</HI> the king of <HI>Spaine, Annius</HI> out of <HI>Manethon,</HI> and <HI>Beutherus</HI> out of the Annales do report: let themselues auow it. In an ancient inscription it is named <HI>COLONIA IVLIA VALENTIA.</HI> It retained the name of <HI>Rome</HI> (saith the same <HI>Beutherus</HI>) vntill the Romans subdued it. Who hauing inlarged &amp; beautified the same, called it <HI>Va∣lentia,</HI> a name signifying the quality of the place. Here was a councell held in the yere of our Lord <HI>466.</HI> It is a city of venerable antiquity, where euen till these our dayes remaine many ancient marbles with in∣scriptions of the Romans grauen vpon them, whereof some are in the custody of the said <HI>Beutherus</HI> and <HI>Ambr. Morales.</HI></P>
<P>The territory of this city is for the greatest part inhabited by a people descended of the Moores, re∣taining as yet the speech and conuersation of their fathers and grandfathers, which I learned of that most worthie and famous man <HI>Frederick Furius Caeriolanus</HI> naturall of <HI>Valentia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>GADES: otherwise called CADIZ, CALIZ, or CALIS-MALIS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Nder the name of <HI>Gades, Strabo, Plinie,</HI> and some other Writers giue notice of two islands. <HI>Mela, Solimus, Dio∣nysius</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey</HI> make mention but of one, which together with the city, they call <HI>Gadira.</HI> They that will haue two <HI>Gades,</HI> call the one, <HI>The greater,</HI> and the other, <HI>The lesser.</HI> This (as writeth <HI>Plinie</HI> out of <HI>Philistides, Ti∣maeus,</HI> and <HI>Silenus;</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> out of <HI>Pherecides</HI>) was named <HI>Erythia,</HI> and <HI>Aphrodisea,</HI> and they call it also <HI>Iunoes</HI> Island. By the inhabitants also it was properly called <HI>Erythia,</HI> and <HI>Cotinusa,</HI> by the Carthaginians <HI>Gadir,</HI> and the Romans named it <HI>Tartesson,</HI> as the same <HI>Plinie</HI> writeth. At this present there is but one only isle (and that verie much diminished by the oceans violent waues) which the Spaniards call <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and corruptly <HI>Caliz,</HI> and our countrymen (I know not vpon what ground) <HI>Calis-Malis.</HI> In the lesser of the two foresaid isles stood the towne of <HI>Gades;</HI> and in the greater, <HI>Iulia Gaditana Augusta;</HI> which before, as appeareth out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> was called <HI>Neapolis.</HI> Now they call both towne and island <HI>Cadiz.</HI> It is the seat of a Bishop, who also is intitled Bishop of <HI>Alger.</HI></P>
<P>This Isle was first discouered and inhabited by certaine Phoenicians of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> as is euident out of most ancient records. Vpon this isle some are of opinion, that the Geryones afterward planted themselues, whose droues the Aegyptian or Tyrian <HI>Hercules</HI> forcibly draue away. At one corner of the isle stood the temple of this <HI>Hercules,</HI> famous both for builders, superstition, riches and antiquity. Why it should be holy (saith <HI>Mela</HI>) his bones there buried are a sufficient cause. Vpon the other corner <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmes the temple of <HI>Saturne</HI> to haue been ere∣cted. In the said temple of <HI>Hercules, Caesar</HI> found the image of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, as <HI>Suetonius</HI> in his life reporteth. A fountaine there was very holsome to drinke, which with a strange kind of contrariety diminished at the floud, and increased at the ebbe of the sea. In this temple (as the same author affirmeth) were certaine brazen pillars of eight cubits, wheron were ingrauen the costs bestowed in building of the same. Here also the same author out of <HI>Artemidorus</HI> acknowledgeth a temple dedicated to <HI>Iuno. Dionysius</HI> describes therein the temple of Age and of Death, and tels of certaine altars consecrated to the Yere, to the Moneth, to Arte, and to Pouerty. <HI>Hercules</HI> pillars are here extant (saith <HI>Isi∣dore</HI>) and here growes a kind of tree like a palme, with the gum whereof the glasse of <HI>Epyrus</HI> being mingled, is turned into a precious stone.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of old were famous for their skill in nauigation, and from this their ancient trauersing of the seas, they do not as yet dege∣nerate. But their principall gaine consisteth in making of Salt, and in catching of Tunies: for which they haue euery yeere an ordinary fish∣ing. These fishes being cut in pieces, pouldred and barrelled, are dispersed all <HI>Europe</HI> ouer.</P>
<P>This isle was esteemed by antiquitie the worlds extreame Westerne limit; whereupon saith <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> in his first booke, <HI>And</HI> Gades <HI>the vtmost bounds of men, &amp;c.</HI> Also in his 17. booke: Gades <HI>lands farthest end; And</HI> Calpe, <HI>bounding</HI> Hercules;
<Q>And <HI>Baetis</HI> crystall streames, That bathe <HI>Apolloes</HI> steeds.</Q> For here the Poets faine, that the Sun being weary of his dayes labour, drencheth himselfe in the Ocean, and takes his rest: wherefore <HI>Sta∣tius</HI> also calles it, <HI>Gades the Sunnes soft bed.</HI> Yea at this very time our Netherlandish Mariners call the Westermost Cape of this isle (which by the inhabitants is named <HI>El cabo de San Sebastian) <HI>Het einde der Werelt,</HI></HI> that is to say, <HI>The Worlds end.</HI> This ancient inscription found vpon this isle, is by <HI>Appianus</HI> in his booke of Inscriptions alleged out of <HI>Cyriacus</HI> of <HI>Ancona,</HI> as followeth: HELIODORVS INSANVS CAR∣THAGINIENSIS AD EXTREMVM ORBIS SARCOPHAGO TESTAMENTO ME HOC IVSSI CONDIER, VT VIDEREM SI QVIS∣QVAM INSANIOR AD ME VISENDVM, VS QVE AD HAEC LOCA PENETRARET. In English thus: <HI>I</HI> Heliodorus, <HI>a mad Carthagini∣an commanded in my last will, that they should in this tombe bury me at the worlds end; to see if any more franticke than my selfe would come thus farre to visit me.</HI> But that all this inscription is counterfeit and new, I learne out of <HI>Anthony Augustinus</HI> his eleuenth chapter of ancient coines. Concerning this isle you may reade more at large in <HI>Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Philostratus.</HI> And of the city reade <HI>Brunus</HI> in his volume of cities.</P>

<HEAD>GVIPVSCO.</HEAD>
<P>GVIPVSCO is a part of that Northerne tract of <HI>Spaine</HI> called of olde, <HI>Cantabria;</HI> it borders vpon the kingdome of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and the Pyreney mountaines, which diuide it from <HI>France,</HI> and it is bounded Westard by the prouince of <HI>Biscay.</HI></P>
<P>The inhabitants in <HI>Ptolemey</HI> are called <HI>Varduli.</HI> At this present some call it <HI>Lipuscoa,</HI> others <HI>Lepuscoa,</HI> but corruptly, as <HI>Stephan Garibaio,</HI> borne in the country, writeth. Some ancient records of this country do not vndeseruedly name it The wall and fortresse of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Leon.</HI> It is a mountainous place, euery where so abounding with yron and steele, that for quantity and goodnesse of this mettall it is excelled by no other region in the world. Wherefore from hence to their great commodity, all the neighbour-countries are abundantly supplied with all kind of iron-tooles and instruments. Here likewise they make warlike armour and artillery, as namely Great ordonance, Harquebuzes, Ca∣liuers, Harnesse, Swords, &amp;c. so good, and in such plenty, as people of all nations are desirous to haue them. They themselues also are a peo∣ple very warlike. So that this region a man may rightly call <HI>Mars</HI> his armory, and the inhabitants his workemen. Such as dwell vpon the coasts, spending the greatest part of their time at sea, reape vnto themselues great profit, by taking Newfoundland fish called <HI>Baccalaos,</HI> and Whales; of whose fat they make great quantitie of Traine-oile. Heere also they boile Salt, mixing it (I know not for what purpose) with Oats, and with Hempe-seed.</P>
<P>The head citie is <HI>Tholosa,</HI> situate at the confluence of the riuers <HI>Araxis</HI> and <HI>Oria:</HI> others there are also of note, as <HI>Placencia,</HI> swarming with Smiths: <HI>Motrico,</HI> or rather <HI>Monte de Trico,</HI> so called of the rocke <HI>Trico,</HI> that hangs ouer it. The port of <HI>Sant Sebastian,</HI> which is the lar∣gest &amp; most commodious vpon all the coast. Hither people of sundry nations do trafficke. At first it was called <HI>Hicuru,</HI> afterward <HI>Don Bastia,</HI> and corruptly <HI>Donastia,</HI> which in signification is all one with <HI>Sant Sebastian.</HI> For <HI>Don</HI> in the Biscain tongue signifieth Saint, as <HI>Santo</HI> in Spa∣nish. But by the inhabitants it is commonly called <HI>Vrumea.</HI> For this region differing altogether in language from the residue of <HI>Spaine,</HI> hath many townes called by diuers names, according to the difference of languages; some whereof I thought good here to note, for the benefit of those that reade histories. The sundry names therefore of diuers townes in <HI>Guipusco</HI> are these that follow:
<LIST>

<P>Also the hill <HI>Aralar</HI> is called <HI>Arara,</HI> and the riuer <HI>Vidoso, Vidorso,</HI> and <HI>Alduida,</HI> and <HI>Beyouia.</HI> This riuer runnes betweene <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> In describing this region <HI>Stephan Garibayo</HI> is very copious, in the 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. and 14. chapters of his 15. booke. And <HI>Florian del Campo</HI> writes somewhat of it in his first and second chapter. And <HI>Nauagierus</HI> in his Iournall affirmeth, that there is so much yron and steele dig'd out of the mines of <HI>Guipusco,</HI> as yeeldeth 80000. duckats of yerely gaine. The words of <HI>Plinie</HI> in his 34. booke and 14. chapter, are not (I thinke) to this place impertinent. Vpon the coast of <HI>Cantabria</HI> (saith he) which the Ocean affronteth, there is a craggie high mountaine, a thing very admirable, wholly consisting of the same matter [he meaneth yron.]</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Ll that tract of land from the riuer of <HI>Rhene</HI> included by the Ocean, the Pyreney mountaines, the sea Mediterran, and mount <HI>Appennine,</HI> as farre as <HI>Ancona,</HI> the an∣cient Writers by one generall name called <HI>Gallia.</HI> For Westward by the Pyreney hilles it is disioyned from <HI>Spaine:</HI> North it borders vpon the French and British Ocean: East the riuer <HI>Rhene</HI> and the <HI>Alpes</HI> from sea to sea include it, in like ma∣ner as the Pyreney mountaines doe West: South it is accoasted by part of the Mediterran sea ouer against <HI>Prouence.</HI> It was called <HI>Gallia,</HI> in regard of the peo∣ples whitenesse: for the high mountaines and the heauens rigour exclude the heat of the Sunne from this part: hereof it comes, that their white bodies change not colour. Where∣fore the Graecians name the Gaules or ancient inhabitants of <HI>France,</HI> Galatas, in regard of their milke∣white colour: for <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Greeke, signifieth Milke; from which name the Latines haue called them <HI>Gal∣los.</HI> This deriuation the greatest parts of Writers doe approue: yet some there are that deride it, sup∣posing them rather to be so called of raine, which in Hebrew is <HI>Galah,</HI> and in the olde British language <HI>Glau,</HI> as who should say, A most ancient nation, rain'd vpon, and drenched in the very floud of <HI>Noah.</HI> This region of theirs was of olde diuided into <HI>Gallia Cisalpina,</HI> which in regard of vs lieth beyond the <HI>Alpes,</HI> being that part of <HI>Italie,</HI> which at this present is called <HI>Lombardie:</HI> and <HI>Transalpina,</HI> which is in∣cluded within these fiue bounds, namely, the riuer <HI>Rhene,</HI> the Ocean, the Pyreney mountaines, the Me∣diterran sea, and the <HI>Alpes.</HI> This <HI>Gallia Transalpina</HI> by <HI>Caesar</HI> in his Commentaries is diuided into three parts: <HI>Belgica, Celtica,</HI> and <HI>Aquitanica. Belgica</HI> which is enuironed by the Ocean sea, and the riuers of <HI>Rhene, Marne,</HI> and <HI>Senie,</HI> vsing most part the Dutch tongue, and at this present called the <HI>Low-countries. Celtica</HI> or <HI>Lugdunensis,</HI> which is comprehended within the riuers <HI>Garomne, Marne, Senie,</HI> and <HI>Rhosne.</HI> It is now called <HI>France.</HI> For the <HI>Celtae</HI> were subdued by the Francks of <HI>Germany:</HI> so that at length they were named Westerne Francks, from whom the prouince it selfe is denominated. <HI>Aquitanica</HI> before named <HI>Aremorica,</HI> which extendeth from the riuer <HI>Garomne</HI> to the Ocean, and to the Pyreney mountaines. West and by North it is confined with that part of the Ocean which is called the Bay of <HI>Aquitane.</HI> Westward. it hath <HI>Spaine:</HI> North, <HI>Celtica</HI> or <HI>France</HI> properly so called: and South, the country of <HI>Prouence.</HI> It is now called <HI>Gascoine,</HI> and the inhabitants differ both in stature, and language from the residue of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>These are the ancient limits of the Gaules. Howbeit the countrey of the French, which at this day beares the title of a Kingdome, and is commonly called the Kingdome of <HI>France;</HI> hath not so large ex∣tension: but towards the North only is so much the narower, as it is cut off by an imaginary line from <HI>Strasbourg</HI> vpon <HI>Rhene</HI> to the port of <HI>Calais;</HI> and it comprehends all that tract of land, which is con∣teined within this line, the Ocean sea, the Pyreney mountaines, the sea Mediterran, and the <HI>Alpes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Postellus</HI> in his booke of the whole world, reckons vp the peculiar Shires, or Prouinces of this King∣dome in maner following: In the East it hath <HI>Prouence, Sauoie, Swisserland, Bressia, Borgogne, Lorraigne, Champanie, Henault, Cleue,</HI> and <HI>Flanders:</HI> on the North, <HI>Picardy, Normandy,</HI> and <HI>Bretaigne:</HI> on the West, <HI>Bre∣taigne, Aniou, Poictou, Xantoigne,</HI> and <HI>Gascoigne:</HI> and on the South, <HI>Gascoigne, Bearne, Roussillon, Dauphnie, Vellay, Forest, Auuergne, Limosni, Perigort,</HI> and <HI>Angolesme.</HI> East of <HI>Poictou</HI> lie the prouinces of <HI>Bourges, Bour∣bon, Beaioulois, Lionnois,</HI> the Countie of <HI>Burgundy, Auxerrois, Niuernois, Berry, Tours, Vendosme</HI> beyond <HI>An∣iou, le Beaulse, Gastinois, Valois</HI> beyond <HI>Sens,</HI> and not farre off <HI>le Perche, Druise,</HI> and <HI>le Mans</HI> neere <HI>Bretaigne.</HI> And thus at this present are these Prouinces named. But albeit <HI>Postellus</HI> accounteth <HI>Sauoy, Swizzerland, Loraigne, Henault, Cleue,</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> among the Prouinces of <HI>France,</HI> yet are they not now vnder the go∣uernment of this Kingdome: for all of them haue peculiar princes, not subiect to the crowne of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the French King, <HI>Villa Nueua</HI> reports two memorable things: First, That in the Church of <HI>Rhemes</HI> there is a vessell full of neuer-decaying oile, sent from heauen, to anoint the Kings of <HI>France</HI> at their coronation. Secondly, That the same Kings doe heale the disease called in English, <HI>The Queenes euill,</HI> only with touching the place affected.</P>
<P>All <HI>France</HI> is described in a large volume, by <HI>Robert Caenalis;</HI> reade also concerning the same argument <HI>Gilbert Cognatus Nazorenus; Iohannes Marius; Chassanaeus</HI> in his twelfth booke <HI>De gloria mundi; Postellus</HI> in his booke Of the whole world; <HI>Aimon</HI> in the beginning of his storie of the Franks; <HI>Sebastian Munster; Belle∣forest; Theuet;</HI> and other Describers of the world. Touching this region also, and the disposition of the inhabitants, you may learne somewhat out of the second booke of <HI>Laonicus Chalcocondylas</HI> of <HI>Athens.</HI> Of ancient Writers <HI>Caesar</HI> surpasseth all. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in his fifth booke, and <HI>Ann. Marcelinus</HI> in his fif∣teenth booke haue many notable things concerning this region. Likewise <HI>Claudius Champier</HI> of <HI>Lions</HI> wrote in French a Treatise of the first originals of the principall townes in all <HI>France: Symphorianus,</HI> fa∣ther to this man, discourseth of the riuers, and the miracles of waters and fountaines in <HI>France.</HI> The ci∣ty of <HI>Paris</HI> is described in verse by <HI>Eustathius à Knobelsdorf;</HI> and the city of <HI>Lions</HI> by <HI>Champier.</HI></P>

<HEAD>BRETAIGNE and NORMANDY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Table representeth that part of <HI>Gallia Lugdunensis</HI> which stretcheth toward the Westerne Ocean. The ancients named it <HI>Armorica.</HI> Heere standeth <HI>Neustria,</HI> corruptly so called of late yeeres for <HI>Vestria</HI> or rather <HI>Westria,</HI> (according to some, <HI>Westrasia</HI>) as much to say, as a Westerne region. The occasion of this errour both in pronunciation and writing, was for that the French wanting a double V, doe alwayes in stead thereof write a single V: and because u in this small forme differs not much from n, hereupon it is likely that <HI>Westria</HI> was prodigiously changed into <HI>Neustria.</HI> In which <HI>Neustria</HI> at this present are situate the regions of <HI>Bretaigne</HI> and <HI>Normandie,</HI> which in this Table we present vnto your view. NORMANDIA so called of the Northerne peo∣ple that ouer-ranne it (for <HI>Nord</HI> in Dutch signifieth North, and <HI>mannen</HI> men) which Northerne people were Danes and Noruegians: who hauing by force subdued this region, planted them∣selues here in the time of <HI>Lotharius</HI> the Emperour. Concerning the situation and nature of this place, these are the words of <HI>Gaguinus</HI> in his seuenth booke: <HI>Normandie</HI> is adorned and fortified with one Metropolitan, six cities, and ninetie foure strong townes and castles: most of their villages also being built citie-like: thorow which Prouince a speedie traueller shall hardlie passe in six dayes: it aboundeth with fish, cattell, and plentie of corne; being in all places so fraught with peares and apples, that the people make all their drinke of the same; and yet send great quantitie to other countreys. They exercise clothing, and are notable quaffers of cyder. They are naturally a wilie people; subiect to no forren lawes; liuing after their owne fa∣shions and customes, which they most obstinately maintaine: cunning they are in sleights and sutes of law; whereupon strangers are loth to haue any dealings with them; being otherwise well addicted to learning and religion. Moreouer, they are very apt and valiant in the warres, many of whose worthy acts against strangers are recorded. Thus farre <HI>Gaguinus.</HI> Of the qualitie of this region you may more largely informe your selfe out of <HI>Henry Altissiodorensis</HI> his fifth booke of the life of <HI>S. German.</HI> It aboundeth, as <HI>Caenalis</HI> makes report, with all things necessary for mans life, wine only excepted, which the soile doth not yeeld. The chiefe city is <HI>Rouen</HI> (in English commonly called <HI>Roan</HI>) which hath a most learned Senate, or Court of Parliament, that execute iustice, and decide the controuersies of the whole Prouince. Heere are also great Mer∣chants, by meanes of whose trafficke the citie is knowen farre and neere. In this citie there is a church dedicated to the Vir∣gin <HI>Mary,</HI> beautified with a most lofty steeple, wherin hangs the greatest bell in all <HI>France,</HI> weighing forty thousand pounds, as these French verses grauen thereupon do testifie.</P>
<Q><L>Ie suis nominée <HI>George</HI> d' Amboise,</L>
<L>Qui plus que trente six mil poise:</L>
<L>Et si qui bien me poysera</L>
<L>Quarante mil y trouuera.</L></Q>
<P>In English:</P>
<Q><L><HI>George</HI> de Amboise my name rightly sounds,</L>
<L>I weigh more than thirtie six thousand pounds:</L>
<L>Whoso poiseth me well</L>
<L>Fortie thousand may tell.</L></Q>
<P>This <HI>George,</HI> after whose name the bell is called, was Archbishop of <HI>Roan,</HI> about the yeere 1500. who considering that in his Diocesse (such was the scarsitie of oile, as it would hardly be sufficient for the time of Lent) granted to his Diocessans in stead thereof the vse of butter, conditionally that they should pay six halfepence Tournois a piece: with which summe of money he caused the said steeple to be built; which thereupon is yet called <HI>Latour de beur;</HI> that is, The steeple of butter. The antiquities, and other memorable matters of this city, <HI>F. Noel Taillipied</HI> hath described in French in a peculiar Trea∣tise. Thus much of <HI>Normandie.</HI></P>
<P>BRETAIGNE bordering vpon the coast of <HI>Normandie,</HI> is the vtmost prouince of <HI>France</HI> toward the Ocean. Some thinke that this was of old called <HI>Aremorica.</HI> Sure I am that <HI>Caesar</HI> describeth cities which he calleth <HI>Aremericas</HI> vpon this coast. But <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Sidonius</HI> do name the inhabitants <HI>Britannos,</HI> placing them vpon the riuer of <HI>Loire.</HI> The Middle-age writers call them <HI>Brittones,</HI> which name they yet retaine. <HI>Plinie</HI> most aptly calles this region, The godliest Peninsula of <HI>Gallia Lugdu∣nensis.</HI> In a fragment of the Frankes history I reade that it was once called <HI>The horne of France;</HI> from the shape thereof, as I suppose. <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> is of opinion, that the Brittons being named <HI>Hermiones,</HI> tooke occasion by way of allusion vnto this name, to make choise of those armes which they now beare, commonly called <HI>Ermines,</HI> with weasels tailes, and the natiue colour of blacke in a field argent &amp;c. This region he saith is somewhat drie, and not very fruitfull; more apt to beare millet than wheat. Their fields (saith he) they call lands. It seemeth more properly to be named <HI>Eremorica</HI> than <HI>Aremorica.</HI> For they make larger leagues betweene towne and towne, namely of three miles; which is no slight argument of a barren soile. Hereof the coniecture seemes not improbable, that it was called <HI>Brutannia,</HI> of nourishing or feeding brute beasts. So many of their townes (as antiquity reports) are denominated from flocks and droues: as for example, <HI>Pullinaicum, à pullis equinis,</HI> from horse-coltes; <HI>Filicieriae,</HI> now called <HI>Fulgeriae,</HI> alias <HI>Foulgeres,</HI> of braky grounds; also <HI>Rhedones, à Rhedis,</HI> that is to say, of carts which cary commodities long and tedious iourneys: which I rather beleeue, than that it first borrowed the name from <HI>Brutus.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Caenalis:</HI> let the trueth thereof stand or fall vpon his credit. More concerning these countries you may reade in the same authour, and in <HI>Belleforest;</HI> but especially in <HI>Bertrard Argentré,</HI> who hath published a large volume of the same in French. Reade also <HI>Elias Vinetus</HI> vpon <HI>Ausonius</HI> his poem of <HI>Cupid</HI> crucified.</P>

His words be these [speaking of <HI>Sarte</HI> a riuer in this Prouince:] <HI>Sarte</HI> being come to the bridge commonly called <HI>Noien,</HI> as farre as the towne of <HI>Malicorne,</HI> how plentifully and miraculously it aboundeth with fish, may appeare by this one example; that not many yeeres past contrary to mens vsuall expectation, here was taken a carpe of an ell and handfull long: his tongue (if we may beleeue the common report) weighed six pounds: which is confirmed also by a monument written vpon the Bishops palace. They say, that not farre from this place in the tract of <HI>Sagona,</HI> there is an ex∣ceeding deepe lake, (it is named The <HI>causey-foord,</HI> for it ends at the place commonly called <HI>Gay Chaucey</HI>) out of which lake are taken carpes of so huge bignesse, that one of them will suffice a meane family for an whole weeke together: the experi∣ence whereof, following the Court, I learned in the towne of <HI>Blois.</HI> Hitherto <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> in his story of <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Mongst the people of <HI>Aquitaigne</HI> some there are called by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> and <HI>Plinie, Pictones;</HI> by <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Strabo, Pictones</HI> with i in the first syllable; and by <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus, Pictauos: Ausonius</HI> names the countrey <HI>Pictonicam regionem:</HI> but later Writers call it in La∣tine <HI>Pictauia.</HI> The inhabitants in their owne language, terme them∣selues <HI>Poicteuins,</HI> the region <HI>Poictou,</HI> and the head city <HI>Poictiers,</HI> which perhaps is all one with <HI>Ptolemey</HI> his <HI>Augustoritum.</HI> The opinion of some who affirme it was thus named of the Pictes, I holde altogether fabulous: for out of Clas∣sicall writers it is apparent that <HI>Pictones</HI> is an ancienter name than <HI>Picti. Poictou</HI> is now diuided into the Lower and the Vpper: The Lower <HI>Poictou</HI> we call that which ends Westward vpon the sea of <HI>Aquitaigne:</HI> and the Vpper, which lieth Eastward towards <HI>Tourain</HI> and <HI>Berry:</HI> South it confines vpon <HI>Xantoigne, Angolesme,</HI> and <HI>Limo∣sin:</HI> and North vpon <HI>Brettaigne</HI> and <HI>Aniou.</HI> It is a countrey most fertile of corne and cattell; rich in wheat and wine; and abounding with fish. Wild-fowle and beasts heere are great plenty, and for that cause much hunting and hauking.</P>
<P>In this region are conteined 1200. Parishes vnder three Bishopricks, namely <HI>Poi∣ctiers, Luçon</HI> and <HI>Maillezais.</HI> The principall places besides these, are <HI>Roch-sur-yon, Talmont, Meroil, Ʋouuant, Meruant, Bresuire, Lodun, Fontenay le Conte:</HI> All which be in the Vpper <HI>Poictou.</HI> In the Lower are situate <HI>Niort, Partenay, Touars, Moncontoul, Hernault, Mirebeau, Chalstelleraudt,</HI> &amp;c. The head of all these is <HI>Poictiers,</HI> which next vnto <HI>Paris</HI> is the principall citie in all <HI>France,</HI> and is for the most part enuironed by the riuer <HI>Clain.</HI> The antiquity of this towne sufficiently appeareth out of the Theater (commonly called <HI>Arenas</HI>) as likewise out of <HI>Gallienus</HI> his Palace, and the Arches of Water-conducts as yet extant, which the inhabitants call <HI>Arceaux de Parignè:</HI> all which are Monuments of the Romans gouernment in this place. Howbeit before their comming, this citie was seated vpon another plot of ground, as may be gathered out of the writings of <HI>Ammonius</HI> and <HI>Ado.</HI> For they make mention of a place called Olde <HI>Poictiers,</HI> whereat (they say) was the diuision of the kingdome betweene <HI>Charle∣maine</HI> and <HI>Pipin</HI> Kings of the Frankes. Also in this table vpon the very same riuer of <HI>Clain</HI> towards <HI>Chastellerault,</HI> you may see a place called <HI>Vieu Poictiers,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Old Poictiers.</HI> The towne of <HI>Talmont</HI> or rather <HI>Talon du Monde;</HI> (in English, <HI>The heele of the World</HI>) is so called by the French, because it stands vpon the vtmost border of this countrey towards the Ocean: as if therefore it were to be esteemed the extreame part of the World.</P>
<P>Ouer against the shore of <HI>Poictou</HI> lie these islands: <HI>Oleron,</HI> (by <HI>Plinie</HI> named <HI>Ʋlia∣rius</HI>) at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Charente,</HI> called by <HI>Ausonius Charantonus fluuius,</HI> and by <HI>Ptolemey, Canentelum. L'isle de Rez,</HI> opposite to <HI>Rochell,</HI> abounding with wine, wherof it is named. The isle <HI>Noir,</HI> or <HI>Marmonstier,</HI> which yeeldeth plenty of salt. The isle <HI>Aulonne</HI> which in this Table is rather a Peninsula, this aboundeth with wine and salt: as doth another little isle called <HI>Chauet.</HI> The Mappe also represents vnto you <HI>L'isle de Dieu,</HI> or <HI>Gods isle:</HI> and that likewise which is called <HI>Nostre-dame de Bouin.</HI> By Saint <HI>Hillary</HI> the Apostle of <HI>Aquitaigne,</HI> Ecclesiasticall Writers affirme, that this region was conuerted to Christianity.

<HEAD>The region of BERRY, called of olde BITVRIGES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He people Bituriges are mentioned in most of the ancient Geogra∣phers. <HI>Plinie</HI> calles them <HI>Liberos:</HI> and saith they were also named <HI>Cubos.</HI> The country is now diuided into the Vpper &amp; the Lower. The principall citie (called at this present <HI>Bourges</HI>) was named by <HI>Caesar</HI> (as some thinke) <HI>Auaricum.

<P>In the yeere of the worlds creation 1791. one <HI>Gomer</HI> of the nation of the Gaules, bringing a Colonie into this region of the Bituriges, planted the same in the chiefe citie, the name of <HI>Ogygis</HI> being by <HI>Noah</HI> his grandfather imposed for honours sake vpon the inhabitants: which by them for the fauor and loue they bare to their foun∣der descended of <HI>Ogygis,</HI> was afterward changed: and they named themselues <HI>Bito∣gyges,</HI> which in the Armenian tongue signifies, <HI>The posteritie of</HI> Ogygis. But as words by custome are often times corrupted, (for, to make them familiar, or more proper, we will not sticke to adde, detract, or alter some letters or syllables) so the name of this countrey and of the chiefe citie, either by the force thereof, or by the appointment of a certaine Prince named <HI>Biturix,</HI> changed the name of <HI>Bitogyges</HI> into <HI>Bituriges.</HI> A∣mongst other opinions some hold that it was called <HI>Bituris quasi Biturris,</HI> of two anci∣ent Towers which sometimes stood in this citie: whereupon a certaine Grammarian hath written this verse; <HI>Turribus à binis, inde vocor</HI> Bituris; that is, <HI>Of Towers twaine</HI> Bituris <HI>I was nam'd.</HI> Thus much out of <HI>John Calamaeus</HI> his booke of the originall of the Bituriges, from whence also we haue borrowed this Table.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He people and countrey of the <HI>Andegauenses,</HI> are by <HI>Pto∣lemey</HI> placed in <HI>Gallia Lugdunensi.</HI> The countrey at this present is called <HI>Aniou,</HI> and the people <HI>Angeuins.</HI> In times past it went vnder the name of an Earledome, but since the yeare 1350. it hath beene adorn'd with the title of a Dukedome. East it confineth vpon <HI>Tourain</HI> and <HI>Ʋen∣dosme.</HI> West it bordereth vpon <HI>Bretaigne. Poictou</HI> bounds it Southward, and the Counties of <HI>Maine</HI> and <HI>La Ʋal</HI> on the North.</P>
<P>It is a country not very large, but for fruitfulnesse inferior to none other in <HI>France:</HI> the wine of <HI>Anjou</HI> excelleth all other French wines. Neither is it destitute of other commodities requisite either for the necessity or the plea∣sure of mans life, being euery where beautified with Riuers, Mountaines, Woods, and Medowes. It aboundeth with cattell great and small, and with fish. All this their Riuers and Medowes affoord them. Out of their Mountaines they digge Marble, and a kinde of blew Slates, wherewith they couer Churches and houses. The common people call them <HI>Ar∣doises.</HI></P>
<P>This Region is watered with so many Riuers, Freshets, Fountaines, Fish-pooles, Lakes, and Pondes, that some are of opinion, it was heereto∣fore called <HI>Aeguada,</HI> or <HI>Aguada,</HI> of the abundance of waters: for in the Aqui∣taigne tongue they call Water, <HI>Aigues.</HI> The principall Riuers, besides o∣thers, are <HI>Ligeris,</HI> which the inhabitants do name <HI>Loire,</HI> calling it likewise <HI>The Father of French riuers.</HI> Into this Riuer, within the compasse of <HI>Anjou,</HI> do fall the riuers <HI>Ʋienne, Diue, Thouets, Layon, Leure, Guiuatte, Maine, Seure, Loir</HI> (a riuer diuers from <HI>Ligeris,</HI> for it falles thereinto, and is called by late Writers <HI>Ledus) Aution, Oudon, Maienne, Brionneau, Losse,</HI> and <HI>Erdret,</HI> &amp;c. So that there runne about fortie Riuers thorow this Pro∣uince.</P>
<P>It hath diuers faire cities, the principall whereof is called <HI>Angiers:</HI> per∣haps the same which in <HI>Ptolemey</HI> is named <HI>Juliomagus.</HI> This being the head citie of all the Region, is built on either side the riuer <HI>Meduan,</HI> and ioyned together by a stone bridge. The antiquitie hereof is euident out of certaine ancient ruines of a Theater which hang ouer the Citie, and are called by the common people <HI>Brohan.</HI> Heere sometimes are olde coines found. <HI>Lewis</HI> the second in the yeere 1389. established an Vniuersitie in this place. There be also other townes of note, as <HI>Saumur, Beufort, Bauga,</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD>The territorie of PARIS: commonly called, THE ISLE OF <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N a certaine Iournall of <HI>France</HI> I reade this description of the territorie of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Isle of <HI>France</HI> stretcheth from the towne of <HI>Saint Denis</HI> as far as <HI>Rossy</HI> and <HI>Mont∣morency:</HI> and so it comprehends all the land within the winding nookes of <HI>Seine,</HI> towards <HI>Normandie</HI> one way, and towards <HI>Picardie</HI> another way. The occasions of this name were (as <HI>Andrew Theuet</HI> reporteth) in that the Frankes com∣ming out of <HI>Germanie</HI> planted themselues first in this place, and here their Captaines tooke vpon them the title of Kings: and also for that the Riuers <HI>Marne, Seine</HI> &amp; <HI>Oyse</HI> do in a maner compasse it around. Yet all the Region being comprized within these three Riuers pertaineth not to the said isle, but only that part which is neere vnto <HI>Paris.</HI> My opinion is, that this di∣uision might be made, when the sonnes of <HI>Clouis</HI> sharing the whole King∣dome, limited and included within these bounds the dominions of him who bare rule at <HI>Paris,</HI> and was only called the King of <HI>France.</HI> Howbeit, now this diuision is not obserued, seeing that certaine Cities of <HI>Picardie, Briè,</HI> and other Prouinces are comprehended within the same. But let vs heare the opinion of <HI>Belleforest</HI> also: After the death of the great King <HI>Clo∣uis, France</HI> was diuided after a new maner; for out of one King sprang ma∣ny, and he only was called The King of <HI>France,</HI> who gouerned at <HI>Paris:</HI> wherefore the Isle of <HI>France</HI> is the true and ancient iurisdiction of our Kings; albeit <HI>Pipins</HI> posteritie beganne to neglect it, and afterwards the Parisian territorie fell to them by inheritance, who enioyed the Crowne of all <HI>France.</HI></P>

But the cities which I haue na∣med are of best note, and as it were the principall members of the whole Dukedome. Concerning euery of which I will speake more largely, hauing said somwhat of the Metropolitan: whereunto belong the third part of Bishop-townes, which in times past were vnder the ancient iurisdiction of <HI>Lugdune.</HI> For vnder the third receiued diuision of Diocesses apperteining to the Primacie of <HI>Lugdune</HI> or <HI>Lions,</HI> are comprehended <HI>Tours, La Mans, Angiers, Rhenes, Nants, Cornevaile, Vannes, S. Poll de Leon, Tregoir, Dol, S. Malo, S. Brieu.</HI> The Turones therefore of such antiquitie, and their city the head of so many Nations, <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> recko∣neth in the first rancke of the people of <HI>France:</HI> and so likewise do other ancient Writers. <HI>Pto∣lemey</HI> placeth them vpon the riuer <HI>Ligeris:</HI> and <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> in <HI>Secundâ Lugdunensi.</HI> But in <HI>Caesar</HI> they are oftener mentioned, and that very plainly, especially at the end of his eleuenth booke <HI>De bello Gallico. This done</HI> (saith he) <HI>and all</HI> France <HI>be∣ing at quiet, so great an opinion of this war surprized the Barbarians, that euen those nations which inhabited beyond</HI> Rhene, <HI>sent ambassadours vnto</HI> Caesar, <HI>promising to giue him pledges, and to obey his commandements. He therefore hauing ended his warres, and put his legions in garison among the Carnutes, Andes, and Turones, which were cities neere vnto these places, departed for</HI> Italie. Hence you may gather, that they were not enemies to the Romans, but rather <HI>Caesars</HI> followers. <HI>Gregory Turonen∣sis</HI> often calles them <HI>Senatores Romanos,</HI> for they enioyed the libertie of Free-denizens, which was granted to none but such as were the Romans deere friends, and linked vnto them in most firme league. The Touranois are held to be one of the richest people in all <HI>France,</HI> both for the fruitfulnesse of their fields (which they deseruedly call <HI>The Kings garden</HI>) and also for their excellent maner of gouernment, and the industry of their Citizens, who are especially addi∣cted to traffique, for which purpose their nauigable riuer stands them in great stead. They haue also attempted of late to make silke, than which <HI>Italie</HI> affoords no better. At the East part of <HI>Tourain,</HI> vpon the riuer <HI>Loire,</HI> stands <HI>Amboise,</HI> built in a most excellent and choise seat, and a delicate pure aire: so that this place especially, the French Kings haue chosen to retire and solace themselues in. The city of <HI>Montrichard</HI> situate on a plaine, is on the one side fortified with Rocks and Woods, and hem'd in on the other side with Medowes and delightsome Fields. Without the city are houses vnder ground with Gardens and Ʋineyards on the tops of them. <HI>Loches</HI> vpon the riuer of <HI>Indre,</HI> hath a castle both for pleasantnesse, largenesse, munition and situation, almost incomparable: for situation (I say) both by Arte and Nature impregnable. <HI>Pautruy, Chastillon, Cormery, Beaulieu,</HI> and other cities of this Dukedome, are de∣scribed by <HI>Belleforest,</HI> vnto whom I referre the Reader.</P>

Howbeit this inconuenience is no disgrace to the Citie, nor discourageth Tra∣uellers to frequent it: for the fruitfulnesse and faire beautie of the whole Pro∣uince makes it amiable, and the excellent temper of the aire, populous: It be∣ing for plentie of Wheat, Wine, and other necessaries for mans life, to no Prouince inferiour: for it is all shadie, and full of Woods, Vineyards, Riuers, Brooks, Pooles and Fountaines: so that Nature hath infused a wonderfull fatnesse into this soile, with such a temper of heat vpon the hilles neere about the citie, as causeth their Vineyards exceedingly to prosper. Wherefore this Prouince participating with <HI>Le Beaulse</HI> and <HI>Salloigne,</HI> excelleth them both in their owne commodities. For abounding with Wheat no lesse than <HI>Le Beaulse,</HI> it farre surpasseth thesame in Wines, in other kinds of graine, and in plenty of water.

But the ruines of the ancient walles, yet standing in the next Vineyards, do plain∣ly shew, that the Citie in times past, was much larger than at this present. For first the Romans surpri∣zed it, and afterwards the Gothes, as witnesseth <HI>Sidonius Apollinaris,</HI> when he hath reckoned vp all the ci∣ties of <HI>Aquitaigne</HI> sacked and destroyed by them. The Francks also miserably afflicted it. After them <HI>Charles Martell</HI> laid it waste. And lastly, the English made spoile thereof. Notwithstanding at this time, for the bignesse, it is accounted one of the richest cities in the whole Kingdome; being very well orde∣red and gouerned in regard of the Court of Parliament there, as likewise the authoritie of the Vicount, the Kings Eschequer, and the assembly of the Consuls in Merchants affaires, which they commonly call The Burse.

But the Docke or place for building ships (called <HI>Nauale Gessoriacum,</HI> which <HI>Bilibaldus</HI> falsely affirmes to be <HI>Gaunt</HI>) I thinke rather to be <HI>Ca∣stellum,</HI> now named <HI>Cassell.</HI> Some by another name call it <HI>Petressa</HI> and <HI>Scalas,</HI> com∣monly <HI>Scales.</HI> Moreouer, by the situation of <HI>Boulongne</HI> one may easily coniecture, whether it were <HI>Portus Iccius</HI> or no.

But the later Maps containe betweene <HI>Boulongne</HI> and <HI>Douer</HI> 17. English, which are longer than Italian miles, and from <HI>Calais</HI> 18.

Neere vnto this Frierie, which is not farre from the sea, there is a very commodious place to passe for <HI>England.</HI> It is distant from the higher <HI>Boulongne</HI> about 100. pases or somewhat more. But <HI>Boulongne</HI> the higher is inuironed with most strong walles, and with high ditches compassing the walles. All this region is full of that sand, which those that dwell on the coast call hot sand. Whereupon they will haue the name of <HI>Boulongne</HI> to be deriued of the French word that signifies such kinde of sand, notwithstanding we know it out of <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> to be an ancient name.

Some thinke that they were so named of the warlike weapon called the Pike; which, as they imagine, was here first inuented. Certaine it is, that the prouince of <HI>Picardy</HI> was larger in times past: for we reade that <HI>Artois,</HI> with a part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> as farre as the riuer <HI>Lis,</HI> and the countie of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> were all comprehended vnder the name of <HI>Picardy.</HI> The region which is now properly called <HI>Picardy,</HI> extends not so farre as the Map it selfe.</P>
<P>This Region is part of <HI>Gallia Belgica,</HI> whilom inhabited by the Ambiani, Bel∣louaci, and Veromandui, or (as <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calles them) Romandui. The riuer <HI>Somme,</HI> which some thinke to be <HI>Ptolemey</HI> his Phrudis, refresheth the wole coun∣trey, and makes it most fertile of all kinde of graine, and the townes and cities to abound with all necessaries: for it yeeldeth such plentie of wheat, as it is called by an vsuall prouerbe, The Barne or Granarie of <HI>Paris.</HI> It hath no vineyards; which defect some thinke is rather to be imputed to the sloth of the inhabitants, than to the intemperature either of the soile, or of the climate.</P>
<P>The cities here, of principall note, are <HI>Amiens,</HI> in Latine <HI>Ambianum,</HI> famous both for antiquitie and the Episcopall sea. It is enuironed around with the riuer <HI>Somme.</HI> Wherefore some fondly thinke it to be named <HI>Ambianum, ab ambitu aqua∣rum,</HI> because it is compassed with waters. It is one of the strongest townes in all <HI>France.</HI> The vulgar suppose it to haue beene built by the souldiers of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great. Vnder the diocesse of <HI>Amiens</HI> is <HI>Abbeuile,</HI> the name whereof is new, as appeareth by the deriuation, which in Latine is <HI>Abbatis villa,</HI> that is, The Abbats towne: for out of an Abbey it increased at length to the greatnesse and forme of a citie. It is now the head citie of the county <HI>Ponthieu;</HI> which region is so called, <HI>à multitudine pontium,</HI> of the multitude of bridges; because it is in diuers places peste∣red with Marshes and Fennes. <HI>Picquenie</HI> stands in this prouince also; built as the common sort imagine by one <HI>Pignon</HI> a principall souldier of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great. Likewise in <HI>Ʋermandois</HI> you haue the towne of <HI>S. Quintins,</HI> which many suppose to haue beene <HI>Augusta Ʋeromanduorum,</HI> being the ancient seat of the Earles of <HI>Ver∣mandois,</HI> and the head of that region. <HI>Peronne</HI> so often spoiled in warres, who can be ignorant of? <HI>Guise</HI> also seemes to be a Fort against <HI>Lutzenburgh.</HI> Hence the Guisian familie deriue their name.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat portion of <HI>France</HI> which ancient Writers called <HI>Narbonensem</HI> and <HI>Bracchatam, Caesar</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> doe comprehend vnder the name of <HI>Prouincia:</HI> part whereof is conteined within the riuers <HI>Rosne</HI> and <HI>Durance,</HI> the <HI>Alpes,</HI> the riuer <HI>Varo,</HI> and the Mediterran sea, the inhabitants as yet call by the name of PROVENCE. <HI>Petrarch</HI> writes it was some∣times called <HI>Regnum Arelatense.</HI> The middle-age writers call it <HI>Prouinciam Viennensem tertiam.</HI> It bordereth West vpon <HI>Languedoc,</HI> North vpon <HI>Daulphine,</HI> East it is confined by <HI>Piemont,</HI> and South by the Mediterran sea, and the Isles <HI>Stoechades.</HI> This euer was and now is accounted the most fertile region of <HI>France:</HI> for <HI>Strabo</HI> saith it yeelds all sorts of fruits that <HI>Italie</HI> affoordeth. If we may credit <HI>Belleforest,</HI> it beareth sugar about the towne of <HI>Yeres. Manna</HI> is here gathered, as the same authour affirmeth. The principall cities of this prouince are <HI>Massilia,</HI> commonly <HI>Marseille,</HI> which was the ancient <HI>Ionica Colonia,</HI> of the Phocaean Greeks, being as <HI>Caesar</HI> 5. <HI>Ciuil.</HI> re∣ports, compassed by the sea on three sides; and on the fourth side, hauing a passage to the land. <HI>Strabo</HI> writes, that the hauen is in forme of a Theater, and that within compasse thereof they haue docks for the building, and a storehouse for the furnishing of ships. Here was a temple of the Ephesian <HI>Diana,</HI> and ano∣ther of <HI>Apollo Delphicus.</HI> The citizens were treble-tongued, speaking Greeke, Latine, and French, as S. <HI>Ierome</HI> reporteth out of <HI>Varro.</HI> Of this citie reade more largely in the 43. booke of <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> and in a Pane∣gyricke speech vttered before <HI>Constantine</HI> the great by <HI>Anonymus</HI> or one vnnamed. The citie <HI>Arelatum</HI> com∣monly <HI>Arles,</HI> vpon the riuer of <HI>Rhosne;</HI> which by <HI>Ausonius</HI> is named <HI>Arelas</HI> or <HI>Gallula Roma;</HI> as likewise double <HI>Arelas,</HI> because (as learned <HI>Vinetus</HI> obserueth) it was heretofore by the said riuer diuided in twaine. Now it may well be called single <HI>Arelas,</HI> looking of a farre other shape, and all situate vpon that side of the riuer which is towards <HI>Italie.</HI> This, <HI>Ammianus</HI> makes the renowme of many cities. And <HI>Suetonius</HI> saith, that heere was a Romane colonie planted by <HI>Tiberius</HI> the Emperor his father. <HI>Procopius</HI> affirmes, that it was heretofore the head citie of the Burgundians. Next followes <HI>Aquae Sextiae,</HI> so called (saith <HI>Strabo</HI>) because that very <HI>Sex∣tius</HI> which subdued <HI>Salyes,</HI> built this citie after his owne name, and after the name of certaine hot bathes in the same place. Now it is corruptly called <HI>Aix.</HI> These bathes <HI>Strabo</HI> in his time supposeth to haue turned colde, and so <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> at this present affirmeth, that they haue lost their ancient vertue. The Parlia∣ment of the whole prouince is here resident. Of this citie <HI>Gabriel Simeonius</HI> writeth, that he neuer saw either a more pleasant place, or a more courteous people. Then haue you the citie <HI>Cabellio,</HI> now called <HI>Cauaillon. Tarascon</HI> retaining still the ancient name. <HI>Carpentoracte</HI> commonly <HI>Carpentras. Vasio</HI> now <HI>Voiton:</HI> the same with <HI>Forum Vocontiorum,</HI> as some thinke. <HI>Taurentum</HI> and <HI>Telo Martius,</HI> which some now interpret to be <HI>Tou∣lon. Forum Iulij,</HI> now <HI>Frejus. Olbia</HI> which perhaps is <HI>Yeres. Antipolis, Antibe. Segusteron, Cisteron. Vintium, Venze. Glanatica, Glandeues. Dinia, Digne. Tecolata</HI> thought to be <HI>S. Maximines. Grinicensis, Grasse.</HI> All famous for an∣tiquitie. Moreouer, here is the towne of <HI>S. Baume,</HI> situate vpon a craggie hill, in which is a caue; where, the inhabitants hold opinion, that <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> did penance, and ended her dayes. Likewise at the mouth of <HI>Rhosne</HI> the reader may see on the one side the field called <HI>La Craux;</HI> and on the other side <HI>La Camargo</HI> This last named (they say) is miraculously fertile of wheat. And <HI>Belleforest</HI> thinks it to be called <HI>Camargo, à castris Marij,</HI> of the campe of <HI>Marius</HI> here pitched. Whereas the other named <HI>La Craux,</HI> is out of measure bar∣ren, yeelding nought but stones: for which cause it is by ancient Writers most aptly called <HI>Campus Lapideus,</HI> or The stonie field. The isles adiacent to this prouince are the Stoechades, dispersed, as <HI>Pomponius</HI> writeth, from the shore of <HI>Liguria</HI> or <HI>Genoa</HI> as farre as <HI>Marseille. Plinie</HI> makes them three in number, naming ech. And <HI>Strabo</HI> saith there are three of importance, and two small ones, not worthy to be mentioned. About these isles growes most excellent Corrall, as <HI>Plinie</HI> witnesseth, which <HI>Belleforest</HI> reporteth still to continue. In commendation of this prouince, <HI>Petrus Quinqueranus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Sens,</HI> hath written a peculiar volume.</P>
<P>On this side the riuer <HI>Durance,</HI> this Region bordereth vpon that part of the Popes iurisdiction, which is commonly called <HI>Conte de Venacin,</HI> in Latine <HI>Comitatus Venuxinus,</HI> and <HI>Veneticus,</HI> wherein stands the Citie and Vniuersitie of <HI>Auignon,</HI> which in times past was the Papall sea, namely from Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the fift in the yeere 1300. till <HI>Gregorie</HI> the second, for the space of 60. yeeres. <HI>Petrarch</HI> then called it The French and Westerne <HI>Babylon.</HI> Besides other notable things in this citie, seuen there are, seuen times told, right worthy the admi∣ration; namely, seuen Palaces, seuen Hospitals, seuen Parishes, seuen Nunries, seuen Colleges, seuen Frie∣ries, and seuen gates. Not farre from hence is the valley of <HI>Chisa</HI> at the head of the riuer <HI>Sorgues,</HI> a place so highly magnified by <HI>Petrarch,</HI> as he often calles it his <HI>Helicon</HI> and <HI>Pernassus.</HI> This he made choise of as an hermitage to weane himselfe from worldly cogitations. A man (in my conceit) not of the ordinary cast of Writers, and whom I may boldly and deseruedly call, The Christian <HI>Seneca.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The coast of NARBONNE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE principall places along this coast <HI>William Paradine</HI> describes in these words: <HI>Arles</HI> was a colonie of the Sextaine, as some Writers doe affirme. Standing vpon <HI>Rhosne</HI> it is enui∣roned with Marshes; wherein at this present are a breed of fierce and vntamed Kine. Whi∣lome it was a famous Mart-towne, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writes in maner following: <HI>Narbo</HI> (saith he) the most frequented Mart of this Region, standeth at the outlet of the riuer <HI>Araxis,</HI> by the lake <HI>Narbonensis:</HI> but vpon <HI>Rhodanus</HI> the towne of <HI>Arles,</HI> a Mart of no small importance, is situate. Neere vnto <HI>Arles</HI> are those hot bathes, where <HI>Sextius</HI> (saith <HI>Strabo</HI>) built a towne after his owne name, calling it <HI>Aquae Sextiae.</HI> The cause why he built it was to place a Ro∣man garrison there. Here were the Cimbrislaine by <HI>Marius,</HI> as writeth <HI>S. Ierome. Aurasio,</HI> now called <HI>Orange,</HI> famous in times past for the gouernment of the Gabali, or Cabilonen∣ses; wherin I saw the ruines of an huge Theater, and a mightie wall excellently built of square stone, the like whereof I doubt whether all <HI>France</HI> can affoord. There stands also at the gate towards <HI>Lions</HI> a triumphall arche, with a tilt or turniment of horsmen ingrauen thereupon, which we long beheld with great delight. To this citie belongeth <HI>Nemau∣sum,</HI> now called <HI>Arenas,</HI> a place renowmed for the ancient Theater there extant. Heere is a most woonderfull pas∣sage vnder ground, passing thwart vnder the very chanell of <HI>Rhodanus,</HI> to the citie which standeth afarre off. Heere likewise you may see the Palace of <HI>Plotina,</HI> built by <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperour, as <HI>Spartianus</HI> reporteth, &amp;c. Thus much out of <HI>Paradine.</HI> But of all others, most exactly <HI>Iohn Poldo d' Albena</HI> hath described this citie, and set forth the antiqui∣ties in picture, with the situations and ancient names of the places adiacent. Of this argument reade <HI>Strabo</HI> in his fourth booke: and <HI>Gunterus</HI> a Poet of <HI>Genoa.</HI> The originall of this Table my friend M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Carolus Clusius</HI> of <HI>Arras</HI> gaue me drawen with his owne hand.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>AVOIE standeth on this side the Alpes, the Prince whereof called the Duke of <HI>Sauoie,</HI> is Lord of the Region of <HI>Piemont.</HI> The head citie is <HI>Chamberi</HI> (of olde, as saith <HI>Caenalis,</HI> called <HI>Ciuaro</HI>) wherein the Senate or Parliament resideth. This region some thinke was named <HI>Sabaudia</HI> from certaine people called <HI>Sebusiani,</HI> and as others suppose, of the Sabbatian fourds. But <HI>Bouillus</HI> ren∣ders another reason of this name. For this region (saith he) in regard of the narrow passages (as being situate among the Alpes) and of the scarsitie of inhabitants was all ouer-pestered with theeues, which either robbed or murdered such trauellers as passed that way. Hereupon a certaine Nobleman hauing obtained it of the Emperour vnder the title of a Dukedome, expelled by force of armes all the said theeues and robbers, and made the way most secure for trauellers. This done, he caused it after∣ward to be named <HI>Salua via,</HI> commonly <HI>Sauluoy,</HI> that is, The safe way, which before was called <HI>Mala via,</HI> alias <HI>Maul∣uoy,</HI> The euill or dangerous way: hence the Latines call it <HI>Sabaudia.</HI> Hitherto <HI>Carolus Bouillus.</HI> Whether it be a fable or an historie, I appeale to the authours credit. This one thing I am sure of, that the word SAPAVDIA is often vsed in the booke called <HI>Notitiae prouinciarum,</HI> for a name of one of the prouinces of <HI>Gallia Narbonensis.</HI></P>
<P>But here also I thinke it not amisse to annex the description of this prouince out of the history which <HI>Paradine</HI> wrote of it. His words be these: That region which in Latine is now called <HI>Sabaudia</HI> (commonly <HI>Sauoy</HI>) ancient Writers na∣med <HI>Allobroges.</HI> And it containeth all that tract, which in times past the <HI>Sabbatij, Ingauni, Intimelij, Hiconij, Tricorij, Vicontij, Lepontij, Latobrigi, Medualli, Centrones, Catoriges, Veragri, Nantuarij, Salassi, Tharantasij,</HI> and <HI>Seduni</HI> inha∣bited. The regions therein comprised at this present are thus named: <HI>Sauoy,</HI> the countie of <HI>Geneua,</HI> the Marquisat of <HI>Susa,</HI> the countie of <HI>Morienne,</HI> the Baronisse of <HI>Tharentaise, Brengeois, Foucigni, Chablais, Val de Oste, Pais de Vaul, Pais de Geis,</HI> and some others. The Duchie of <HI>Sauoy</HI> hath vnder it the region of <HI>Piemont,</HI> adorned with the title of a Princedome. Also the region of <HI>Bresse,</HI> wherein are the counties of <HI>Varaz, Mountrueil, Pont de Vaulx, Bagey,</HI> &amp;c. Out of ancient monuments it is apparent, that this region in times past bare the name of a Kingdome; especially in the dayes of <HI>Hannibal:</HI> who being ordained vmpire betweene <HI>Bronchus</HI> and his brother about the gouernment of this countrey, compounded their quarrell, and restored the kingdome to the eldest, whom his yonger brother had expel∣led; as <HI>Liuie</HI> reports in his 21. booke. <HI>Florus</HI> also affirmeth, that <HI>Betultus</HI> (or as some reade it <HI>Betuitus</HI>) the King of this place, was taken captiue by <HI>Fabius Maximus.</HI> And sundrie authours doe make mention of King <HI>Cottius</HI> in the time of the Emperour <HI>Augustus,</HI> of whom the neighbour-alpes were called <HI>Cottiae.</HI> More concerning this region you may reade in <HI>Philibert Pingonicus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LORRAIN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE bounds of <HI>Lorrain</HI> in times past extended much farther, for it comprehended in a maner all the whole region lying betweene the riuer <HI>Rhene,</HI> and <HI>Scheld,</HI> and the mountaine <HI>Vogasus.</HI> All which was diuided into the higher, and the lower. The lower <HI>Lorrain</HI> contained <HI>Brabant, Haspengow, Guelders,</HI> and <HI>Cleue.</HI> In the higher were the Bishopricke of <HI>Liege,</HI> with the coun∣ties of <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> and <HI>Limburg:</HI> as likewise the duchy of <HI>Maesland,</HI> the countie Palantine vpon <HI>Sur,</HI> and the territorie of <HI>Hundsruge:</HI> together with this present Dukedome of <HI>Lorrain</HI> retaining as yet the ancient name <HI>Lotharingia,</HI> imposed by <HI>Lotharius</HI> sonne to <HI>Ludouicus Pius,</HI> vnto whose share it befell: lying in the midst between <HI>Westrasia</HI> (or as some vnskilfully call it <HI>Noastria</HI>) which fell to <HI>Charles,</HI> and <HI>Austrasia</HI> to <HI>Lewis Lotharius</HI> Brethren. This therefore I thinke not amisse more largely to describe, not in mine owne wordes, but in the wordes of <HI>Symphorianus Campeg∣gius,</HI> sometimes a famous Physition of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> LORRAIN (saith he) ioineth East vpon <HI>Alsatia,</HI> commonly <HI>Elsas,</HI> South vpon <HI>Burgundy,</HI> West vpon <HI>Champaigne,</HI> &amp; North it is bounded vpon the Forest <HI>Arduenna.</HI> This region albeit compassed with loftie Alpes, is notwithstanding so fat and fertile, as it need no supply from the neighbour-prouinces: it abounds with cattell great and small, with meadowes, corne, wine, fishpooles, high woods, healthfull bathes, saltpits, yron, copper, lead, tinne, siluer, precious stones, looking glasses, Calcidons, and is watered by sundrie riuers: foure whereof are famous aboue the rest. <HI>Mosa</HI> the first of these foure springing out of mount <HI>Vogesus</HI> (of which mountaine a great and a good part of <HI>Lorraine</HI> is named <HI>Le bois,</HI> and <HI>Le forest de Voige</HI>) and running along by <HI>Neufchasteau,</HI> a towne very commodious both for pleasant situation, and wholesome ayer: diuideth the duchie of <HI>Barre</HI> from <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and casteth it selfe into one of the chanels of <HI>Rhene,</HI> before it falleth into the sea. <HI>Mosella</HI> the second beginneth Southeast, not far from the towne of <HI>Rimere∣mont;</HI> wherein is a monastery of Nunnes, all gentlewomen, endowed with large reuenues. About six miles from hence are certaine hot-bathes whereunto resort great multitudes of people to cure themselues of sundrie diseases. Then runnes it along with swift streames to the townes of <HI>Espinall, Charmes, Toul</HI> (which in olde time was called <HI>Leuca</HI>) and <HI>Mediomatrices,</HI> now called <HI>Metz:</HI> not farre from whence it falls into the <HI>Rhene,</HI> at a city of <HI>Germany</HI> called of olde <HI>Confluentia,</HI> and now <HI>Cobolentz.</HI> Betweene these two riuers neere the towne of <HI>Vitell,</HI> is a double fountaine seuered like a mans nosethrills, from whence the small riuer <HI>Vena</HI> issueth: which sometimes is sandy, and sometimes miry, and for the most part very vnseemely and forlorne: the waters whereof are commonly dried vp in <HI>Iune,</HI> except the pooles, which the swelling and violent streames haue made so deepe. <HI>Murtha</HI> the third riuer falling from certaine rockes of siluer-mines, holdeth on his course through the valley of <HI>S. Didier,</HI> wherein is <HI>S. Godeberts</HI> fountaine, which is generally reported to be medicinable for many diseases. The said riuer runnes along by the towne of <HI>S. Didier,</HI> and then by the townes of <HI>Raon</HI> and <HI>Luneuill:</HI> all which both for naturall situation, and for rampiers, and walles are places of singular defence. Then followes the towne of <HI>S. Nicholas</HI> ge∣nerally famous both for abundance of marchandise, and multitudes of miracles. Lower downe the riuer stands <HI>Nancey,</HI> the principall towne of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> a place for munition, and fortification of great importance. First it is compassed with two ditches of exceeding depth, and a double wall: also it hath foure most admirable bulwarks, with plenty of warlike engins and artillery. <HI>Murtha</HI> falles into <HI>Mosell.</HI> And <HI>Sartha</HI> the fourth riuer running along the confines of <HI>Westereich,</HI> a prouince subiect to <HI>Lorraine</HI> towards the East, holdeth on his course by the townes of <HI>Sarburg, Saralben, Sarprucke,</HI> with others, and then falles into <HI>Mosell.</HI></P>
<P>Now whereas <HI>Lorraine</HI> aboundeth all ouer with speciall commodities; many of them we will omit, and speake only of the most principall. First therefore the mountaines of this prouince doe in all kind of mineralls excell euen the <HI>Pyreney</HI> mountaines: wherein, not to speake of the rest, there are diuers siluer-mines, so abounding with that kinde of mettall, as it is incredible what commoditie it yeelds to the whole countrey.</P>
<P>There are also salt-mines, out of which is digged most pure, sauorie, and snow-white salt: which yeeldeth yerely to the Duke, all charges deducted, 100000. francks.</P>
<P>Heere is found likewise a kind of matter, whereof they make looking glasses and drinking glasses, the best, by all mens confession, in <HI>Europe:</HI> nor is there in any place the like to be had.</P>
<P>Also <HI>Calcidons</HI> of so extraordinarie bignesse, that I my selfe saw at the Bishops of <HI>Toul,</HI> a great cuppe made of one whole piece.</P>
<P>Item, the <HI>Lazul</HI> (or <HI>Azure</HI> stone) representing most excellent colours. A minerall out of which the miners raise exceeding gaine.</P>
<P>In the valley of <HI>Voige</HI> are fountaines (a matter memorable, and not to be omitted) so abounding with a kinde of pearles, and precious stones, as the greater part of <HI>Germanie</HI> doth vse them: which all Lapidaries and Iewellers of other countries do not only approue, but also preferre before the stones and pearles of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>There is a lake of foureteene miles in compasse, stored with carps of huge bignesse; for they are generally of three foot long, and a foot broad; which for pleasantnesse of taste, are (in mine opinion) to be preferred before all other standing-water-carps in <HI>Europe.</HI> The lake is fished with nets euery third yeere; the fishing whereof (as euery man knowes) yeeldeth the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> 16000. francks.</P>
<P>Moreouer, <HI>Lorrain</HI> aboundeth with wheat, wine, cattell of all sorts, woods, excellent horses, which surpasse the Tur∣kish horses in courage, the Spanish in swiftnesse, and the English in stature. In briefe, for tall men and beautifull women; and all things necessary for mans life, it is inferiour to no other countrie. Thus farre <HI>Symphorianus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Francis Roseus</HI> very lately wrote a large volume of the pedegree, and famous acts of the Dukes of <HI>Lorraine.</HI> And I my selfe in mine <HI>Itinerarium,</HI> or Iournall, haue published some things of this Region not vnwoorthie the remembrance.</P>

The cities of the lower <HI>Burgundie</HI> are: SALINS, a large citie, so named in regard of certaine salt and high fountaines; for here is excellent white salt made, which is carried hence in carts to the neighbour countries, and yeelds great reuenue to this region: SCODINGA, situate in a long streight valley, extending in length betweene a double ridge of high mountaines, which beare vines in such places as are most open to the Sunne: it is ex∣ceeding strong, being fortified with two castles, and diuers loftie turrets. ARBOIS, seated in a most pleasant soile, and abounding with all necessaries, especially with excellent and durable wine. It hath large suburbs on all sides. It is enuironed with ditches, but such as they make gardens vpon. Round about it are mountaines of most beautifull prospect, watered with cleare springs, and clad with fruitfull vines, and sightly woods. It is called <HI>Arbois ab Arboribus,</HI> because it is so planted with trees: POLIGNY a faire towne, fortified with stately walles and towers; the castle called <HI>Grimonia</HI> lying within it: and on the one side it hath mountaines of woods; and on the other side hilles set with vines, the wine whereof is principall good. PONTARLIER, situate in a low valley betweene two mountaines, on the bancke of <HI>Dubis.</HI> Not farre hence stands the strong castle of <HI>Iura</HI> or <HI>Ioux,</HI> on the top of an exceeding high hill; so that for situation it is impregnable. NOZEROY, founded vpon an open hill, in the very nauell or midst of this region. All the houses in a maner are built of stone: the Prince of the countrey hath here a castle, called The Leaden castle, because it is couered with lead. Here is a Faire kept foure times in the yere. In times past this towne, before it was walled, was named <HI>Nucillum,</HI> of the abundance of hazel-nuts that grew round about it. CHASTEL CHA∣LON, built and named by the Emperour <HI>Charlemaine,</HI> both pleasantly and strongly situate. MONTMOROT, vpon a steepe mountaine planted with vines. ORGELET, abounding with merchandise. The inhabitants are industrious and painfull, and exercise themselues in clothing. Their fields are barren, for they are full of hilles and craggie rocks; whereupon is grounded a com∣mon prouerbe, which saith, That <HI>Orgelet</HI> hath fields without grasse, riuers without fish, and moun∣taines without woods and groues. The cities of <HI>Dole,</HI> are first, DOLE it selfe, the head citie of the prouince, a nurse of all learning, and especially of the ciuill law, most pleasantly situate vpon the ri∣uer <HI>Dubis,</HI> adorn'd with bridges, walles, and inuincible forts. The houses, churches and schooles, both for greatnesse and curious building are most delightfull to the beholders. QVINGEY, a most ancient towne, situate vpon the bancke of <HI>Louë.</HI> ORNANS, standing also among high mountaines by the riuer <HI>Louë.</HI> LA LOY, a most ample village. ROCHFORT a pretie litle towne. VERCELLES with ruinous and deformed walles. In this countie stands BESANÇON, a citie Imperiall, and Metropolitan of both <HI>Burgundies:</HI> the description whereof, because I cannot con∣dignly expresse in this page, being exactly performed by <HI>Gilbert Cognatus, Paradine,</HI> and <HI>George Bruno</HI> in his volume of cities; I cease here to speake any farther. For sith their books are so easie to be had, I referre all students to them. To these also you may adde <HI>Robert Caenalis.</HI> It were to be wished that <HI>Cognatus</HI> had not frustrated the hope of students: for he promised in a booke, to restore and bring to light ancient <HI>Burgundie,</HI> together with a particular Map, and the olde and new names of places. But we haue hitherto expected him in vaine. Howbeit, not long since <HI>Lewis Gollusius</HI> published concerning this Countie in French, a great and peculiar volume.</P>

<HEAD>The Dukedome of BVRGVNDIE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat part of <HI>France</HI> which the <HI>Aedui</HI> whilome enioyed is now called The Dukedome of <HI>Burgundie.</HI> It is limited North by <HI>Champaigne</HI> and <HI>Gastinois:</HI> West, by <HI>Niuernois</HI> and <HI>Burbonnois:</HI> South, it borders vpon <HI>Lionnois:</HI> and East the riuer <HI>Rhosne</HI> diuides it from <HI>Sauoy</HI> and the county of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> The head citie in times past was <HI>Augustodunum:</HI> but now <HI>Diuio,</HI> or <HI>Diuionum,</HI> as <HI>Gregory Turonensis</HI> in his third booke calles it, or as the in∣habitants, <HI>Digion</HI> hath gotten the superiority; for here the supreme court of Parlia∣ment for the whole Dukedome is holden. It is seated on the bancke of <HI>Oscarus</HI> (com∣monly <HI>Ousch</HI>) a riuer abounding with fish, in a fertile and plentifull soile, the moun∣taines adiacent yeelding strong and excellent wines: as the said <HI>Turonensis</HI> reporteth, who most learnedly describes it. Some thinke it was built by the Emperour <HI>Aurelian;</HI> but others affirme it to be much ancienter. It is a citie both by arte and nature most strongly fortified against all hostile attempts, certaine new forts being lately added. <HI>Belna</HI> (commonly <HI>Beaulne</HI>) is the second citie of the Dukedome, famous for the wines of <HI>Beaulne,</HI> which all men commend. This Citie is fairely built, being impregnable in regard of a Castle which <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth erected here. It hath an hospitall comparable for building to any Kings Palace. Here also is the seat of the high court of Chancery. In the territorie adiacent was built by Duke <HI>Otho</HI> about the yeere of our Lord 1098. the abbey of <HI>Cistertium;</HI> in a woody and clammy soile, which some thinke was so called in regard of certaine Cisternes there digged. Vnder the iurisdiction of this Monasterie <HI>Belleforest</HI> reporteth, that there are 1800. other Monasteries of Friers, and as many of Nunnes.</P>
<P>Next followes <HI>Augustodunum</HI> (which some, though vpon no sufficient grounds of antiquitie, suppose to haue beene called <HI>Bibracte</HI>) now <HI>Auttun.</HI> That this citie of ancient times was most large and populous, it is euident out of sundry authours, and especially out of <HI>Caesar.</HI> Here are yet extant mightie ruines of a Thea∣ter, of Statues, Pillars, Water-chanels, Pyramides, and many other monuments of antiquitie. Likewise here are dayly digged vp coines, little vessels, and other such ancient fragments. This citie hath endured two memorable ouerthrowes: one by <HI>Caesar</HI> in his French warres; and the other about the time of <HI>Galienus</HI> the Emperour. But it was afterward reedified by <HI>Constantine</HI> the sonne of <HI>Claudius,</HI> as the Panegyrick of <HI>Eu∣menius,</HI> calling it <HI>Flauiam Heduorum,</HI> doth testifie. And at this very day it is adorned with stately temples, and other buildings for publicke vses.</P>
<P>Then haue you <HI>Matiscona Caesaris,</HI> or <HI>Matisconense castrum Antonini,</HI> where he placeth in garrison the tenth Roman legion. It is now called <HI>Mascon.</HI> Of olde it was graced with the title of an Earledome. It ioyneth the bancks of <HI>Araris</HI> by a bridge. Here, the Lords day of the Christians began first to be hallowed, as <HI>Pa∣radine</HI> reporteth out of the Edict of <HI>Guntram.</HI> The relation of the citie of <HI>Mascon, Philip Bugnonius</HI> hath ele∣gantly, and briefly set downe. <HI>Cabilonum,</HI> now <HI>Chalon,</HI> vpon the bancke of <HI>Araris</HI> also, anciently called <HI>Or∣bandale,</HI> as reporteth <HI>Peter Sanjulian.</HI> By <HI>Antoninus</HI> the foureteenth Roman legion was here put in garrison. It was of olde the royall seat of <HI>Guntram,</HI> which notwithstanding afterward <HI>Lotharius</HI> sonne to <HI>Ludouicus Pi∣us</HI> so destroyed and abolished with fire, as he left no mention at all of a citie: yet now it is very rich, and a place of great trafficke. Also toward the North you haue <HI>Semur,</HI> a faire towne built vpon an high ground. As like <HI>Castillon, Flauigni, Soloigne, Noiers,</HI> with others, the description whereof, because this page cannot well containe, I referre the Reader to <HI>Belleforest,</HI> a diligent Surueyer of these parts. Only one thing I will adde out of the foresaid <HI>Sanjulian.</HI> He against the opinion of all other Writers, deriueth this word <HI>Burgun∣die,</HI> not <HI>à burgis,</HI> that is, from the boroughs or incorporate townes built in this region, but from one parti∣cular place called <HI>Burg Ogne.</HI> In the territorie of <HI>Langren</HI> about the riuer <HI>Tille,</HI> betweene <HI>Luz</HI> and <HI>Tille-castle,</HI> he saith there is a plaine which the inhabitants call by no other name but <HI>Val d'Ogne:</HI> where in times past stood a famous borough or city. Hence without all question he affirmes, that the Burgundians, or as they are commonly called <HI>Burgognons,</HI> do borow their name; and holds those Writers much deceiued, that re∣port them, as vagabond people, to haue come out of <HI>Sarmatia, Scandia,</HI> or the fennes of <HI>Maeotis</HI> to inhabit this region; indeuouring to persuade all men that they were the first and most ancient inhabiters of this countrey.</P>
<P>The limits of <HI>Burgundie</HI> were larger in times past, as appeareth out of sundrie authours. For some there are that bound it South by the Mediterran sea; East, by the Alpes and the riuer <HI>Rhene;</HI> North, by mount <HI>Vogesus;</HI> and West, by the riuer of <HI>Loire,</HI> and <HI>Seine.</HI> Then, classicke Writers record, that it was gouerned by Kings, whose royall seat was <HI>Arles.</HI> It was diuided into the Duchie and Countie of <HI>Burgundie,</HI> about the yeere 1034. as the Chronicle of <HI>Aemilius</HI> testifieth. Of the Burgundians <HI>Paradine</HI> and <HI>Nicolas Vignier</HI> haue professedly written in Latine, and <HI>Peter Sanjulian</HI> in French. Of the ancient <HI>Aedui</HI> reade <HI>Nazarius</HI> his Pane∣gyricke pronounced before <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour.</P>

<HEAD>GERMANIE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>ERMANIE, the greatest and largest countrey of <HI>Europe,</HI> is distinguished by many names: the limits whereof by authours, according to euery ones seuerall time, are so diuersly described, as they seeme, applying themselues to the pecu∣liar ages wherein they liued, to giue notice of a threefold <HI>Germanie;</HI> namely, the ancient, that of middle ages, and <HI>Germanie</HI> as it is now taken. The ancient is that of <HI>Berosus,</HI> which he circumscribeth by the <HI>Rhene,</HI> the Ocean, the riuer <HI>Tanais,</HI> the Euxine sea, and the riuer <HI>Danubius.</HI> That of middle ages is the same which <HI>Taci∣tus, Ptolemey,</HI> and <HI>Plinie,</HI> all of one time acknowledged: whereof, because it is suf∣ficiently knowen out of the authours themselues, I hold it needlesse in this place to make any descrip∣tion. But <HI>Germanie</HI> as it is now taken, we do confine by the German or Dutch tongue; which learned <HI>Goropius Becanus</HI> in his volume of the antiquities of nations, most wittily and learnedly sheweth to be the ancientest language in the world. Wherfore all those countries which at this day vse the same lan∣guage, we comprehend vnder the name of <HI>Germany.</HI> And so the greatest length thereof stretcheth from <HI>Calais</HI> on the West to the riuer <HI>Vistula</HI> or <HI>VVixel</HI> Eastward: and the largest bredth from the German and Baltick seas to the Alpes. The names of the seuerall regions are these, <HI>Flanders</HI> (the most Westerly) <HI>Brabant, Zeland, Holland, Frisland, Denmarke, Meckleburgh, Pomerland, Prussia,</HI> which extendeth beyond the riuer <HI>Vistula</HI> towards the Baltick sea: as likewise the ancient and new Marquesates, <HI>Saxonie, VVestphalia, Gelders, Cleueland, Iuliers,</HI> the Bishopricke of <HI>Colen, Hessen, Turingen, Misnia, Lusatia, Silesia, Morauia, Bohe∣mia, Franconia,</HI> the Bishopricke of <HI>Mentz, Lutzenburg,</HI> the Bishopricke of <HI>Triers,</HI> the Countie Palatine, <HI>Elsas, VVertenberg, Sueuia, Bauaria, Austria, Stiria, Carinthia, Tirolis,</HI> and <HI>Switzerland</HI> next vnto <HI>France.</HI> There be also more names of pettie regions, but such as are either of no great moment, or comprehended vn∣der the former. And albeit <HI>Bohemia</HI> speaketh not the German but the Sclauonian tongue, yet because it is situate in the midst of <HI>Germanie,</HI> and the King thereof is one of the Prince-electours, it is also num∣bred amongst the German prouinces.</P>
<P>This countrey of <HI>Germanie,</HI> which for the present is adorned with the title of the Roman Empire, is so replenished with beautifull and strong cities, castles, villages and inhabitants, as it is no whit inferi∣our to <HI>Italie, France,</HI> or <HI>Spaine:</HI> for corne, wine, and riuers abounding with fish, it may compare with the most fruitfull regions Here are fountaines of water, hot bathes, and salt-mines in abundance: and for plentie of mettals, namely, gold, siluer, lead, tinne, brasse, and iron, no countrey shall euer go beyond it. Moreouer, you shall no where finde more courteous and ciuill behauiour, more honest and com∣ly attire, more skill and furniture for the warres, nor greater store of nobilitie. This is the place that whilome (as <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> affirmeth) was either darkened with woods, or drowned with fennes. <HI>Such changes can succeeding times affourd,</HI> as saith the Poet.</P>
<P>Of late Writers it hath beene diligently described by <HI>Beatus Rhenanus, Munster</HI> in his Cosmography, <HI>Franciscus Irenicus, Iohannes Auentinus</HI> in his Chronicle of <HI>Lyonnois:</HI> Briefly by <HI>Bilibaldus Pirkeimerus, Iohan∣nes Bohemus Aubames: Gerardus Nouiomagus, Conradus Peutingerus, Conradus Celtes</HI> a Poet, <HI>Iacobus VVimfelingius</HI> of <HI>Sletstade, Aimon</HI> in the beginning of his French storie, and <HI>Henry Pantalion</HI> at the entrance of his first booke of <HI>Prosopographia. Sebastian Brand</HI> hath set downe many iourneys, distances of places, and cour∣ses of riuers in this countrey. The riuer <HI>Rhene</HI> is described by <HI>Bernard Mollerus</HI> in verse, and by <HI>Mag∣nus Gruberus</HI> in prose. <HI>Iohn Herold</HI> hath written two short Treatises of this region: one of the Romans most ancient stations in olde <HI>Germanie;</HI> and another of certeine colonies of theirs on the shore of <HI>Rhae∣tia. Gaspar Bruschius</HI> published a volume of the monasteries of <HI>Germanie.</HI> Of ancient writers <HI>Cornelius Ta∣citus</HI> most exactly described it in a peculiar Treatise: whereon <HI>Andraeas Althamerus, Iodocus VVillichius,</HI> and lately <HI>Iustus Lipsius</HI> haue written most learned Commentaries. Diuers other Writers of <HI>Germanie,</HI> which we haue not as yet seene, are reckened vp by <HI>Francis Irenicus,</HI> in the first booke and second chapter of his Exposition of <HI>Germanie.</HI> But here I thinke it not amisse to alledge the testimonie of <HI>Laonicus Chalco∣condylas</HI> a stranger, namely of <HI>Athens,</HI> concerning this countrey and the inhabitants. Thus therefore he writeth in his second booke: <Q REND="inline">This nation is gouerned with better lawes than any other of those regi∣ons or peoples that inhabit towards the North or West. It hath many noble and flourishing cities, which vse their owne lawes, most agreeable to equitie. It is diuided into sundry principalities, and is subiect to Priests and Bishops adhering to the Bishop of <HI>Rome.</HI> The most famous and wel-gouerned cities in the vpper and lower <HI>Germanie,</HI> are <HI>Norinberg</HI> a rich city, <HI>Strasburg, Hamburg,</HI> &amp;c. The nation is very populous and mighty; ruleth farre and wide all the world ouer; and in greatnesse is second to the Scythians or Tartars. Wherefore if they were at concord and vnder one Prince, then might they well be deemed inuincible, and the most puissant of nations. As touching their bodies, they are verie healthfull, and want nothing. Nor is there any nation that I know gouerned by better lawes. Thus much and more concerning this people and countrey, who list may reade in the same authour.</Q></P>

<HEAD>GERMANIE on this side RHENE, commonly called THE NETHERLANDS or THE LOW COVNTRIES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Table representeth not all the Lower <HI>Germanie,</HI> but only that part which King <HI>Philip,</HI> sonne to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, challenged by right of inheritance. And it conteineth these 17. Prouinces; the Dukedomes of <HI>Brabant, Limburgh, Lutzenburg,</HI> and <HI>Guelders;</HI> the Earledomes of <HI>Flanders, Artois, Henault, Holland, Zeland, Namur, Zutfen;</HI> the Marquesat of the sacred Empire; the Signiories of <HI>Frisland, Mechlin, Vtreight, Ouerissell,</HI> and <HI>Groemingen.</HI> Regions as ciuill and as well manured as any in the world; wherein (according to <HI>Guicciardin</HI>) are to the number of 208. cities fortified with walles, rampiers, or ditches; and villages with churches aboue 6300, besides a great number of hamlets, castles and forts. And this tract (beginning from the East maretine part at the riuer <HI>Amisus,</HI> commonly <HI>Eems,</HI> the bound hereof towards the Ocean) hath these bordering Princes: the Earle of East <HI>Friez,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Cleue,</HI> the Archbishops of <HI>Colen</HI> and <HI>Triers,</HI> and the French King, along the Southwesterne shore as farre as the riuer <HI>Aa,</HI> the extreame Westerne bound of these Prouinces. The aire, though it may seeme ouer-moist, is notwithstanding most healthfull, and agreeable to the constitution and digestion of the inhabitants; who are heere very long liued especially in <HI>Kempenland,</HI> the Northermost part of <HI>Brabant.</HI> It is euery where watered with riuers; and sufficiently adorned with woods and groues, either for pastime of hunting, or beautifull prospect. Mountaines it hath none, saue only about <HI>Lutzenburg, Namur,</HI> and in <HI>Henault,</HI> where it riseth in some places into hilles. It aboundeth with corne and fruits of all sorts, and medicinable herbs. Here also groweth great plentie of that graine, which commonly is called <HI>Buckwey,</HI> but the people corruptly pronounce it <HI>Bockwey;</HI> as if you would say, The Beech-herbe: for the seed or graine (albeit lesse in forme) is three-square, altogether like the nut of the Beech. So as it may truely be called Beech-mast, or if you will <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Whether this simple were knowen of ancient times, let Herbalists enquire. Howbeit, in some sandie places, which the inhabitants, in regard of abundance of heath or linge, call Heath-ground; as in <HI>Kempenland</HI> the North part of <HI>Brabant,</HI> it growes not in such plentie. But this kinde of heath yeeldes such excellent feed for cattell, as (by the confession of neighbour-countries) their flesh is as pleasant and delectable to a mans taste, as any other. This region I suppose, that <HI>Plinie</HI> in his 17. booke and 4. chapter most truely describeth, when he saith: <HI>What better feed than the pastures of</HI> Germanie? <HI>And yet vnder a thin flag you haue immediatly a mould of barren sand.</HI> It bree∣deth no creatures hurtfull to mankinde.</P>
<P>All the foresaid regions, the greatest part of strangers (most ignorantly mistaking part for the whole) call by the name of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the inhabitants Flemings, whereas <HI>Flanders</HI> is but a part only, and but one Prouince of the seuenteene; as in the Table you may plainly see. These therefore are in as great an error, as if a man, to signifie <HI>Spaine,</HI> should name <HI>Castilia, An∣daluzia,</HI> or any other particular Prouince: or speaking of <HI>Italie,</HI> should mention <HI>Tuscan</HI> or <HI>Calabria</HI> &amp;c. or discoursing of the whole kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> should nominate only <HI>Normandy</HI> or <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> &amp;c. and so should imagine himselfe to haue spo∣ken of all <HI>Spaine,</HI> all <HI>Italie,</HI> or all <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>These regions <HI>Iohn Goropius Becanus</HI> in his <HI>Becceselanis</HI> hath most learnedly described, as likewise <HI>Peter Diuaeus</HI> of <HI>Louaine,</HI> and <HI>Hubert Thomas</HI> of <HI>Liege. Iohannes Caluetus Stella,</HI> a Spaniard, writ in his owne language a Iournall of King <HI>Philips</HI> pro∣gresse thorow all these Prouinces; wherein you shall finde many particulars worth the reading, that giue great light to the knowledge of these countries and cities. But whoso desires to haue more full and absolute instructions of these places, let him peruse <HI>Guicciardin;</HI> and he will then thinke, that he hath not read of these Prouinces, but seene them with his eyes. Late∣ly also <HI>Dauid Chitraeus</HI> in his Saxon historie hath written both largely and learnedly of the same argument.</P>
<P>Whereas the inhabitants in most places speake both the Dutch and French languages, and the countrey for traffique and other occasions is frequented by Spaniards and strangers of sundry nations; hence it is that diuers cities, townes, and riuers, are called by more names than one: for euery man calles them according to his owne language, by a name much differing from the proper name vsed by the inhabitants. The ignorance of which multiplicitie of names hath made some authours (o∣therwise not to be discommended) to fall into intolerable errours: and amongst the residue, <HI>Dominicus Niger</HI> in his Geogra∣phie; who puts downe <HI>Anuersa</HI> in stead of <HI>Tarauanna;</HI> and <HI>Antorpia</HI> (which notwithstanding in the copie printed by <HI>Hen∣rick Peterson</HI> he corruptly calles <HI>Antropicia</HI>) he placeth vpon the banke of <HI>Tabuda,</HI> thirty leagues from <HI>Tarauanna;</HI> whereas all men know, that <HI>Antorpia</HI> and <HI>Anuersa</HI> signifie one and the same citie of <HI>Antwerpe.</HI> Likewise <HI>Machelen</HI> and <HI>Malines, Leodi∣um</HI> and <HI>Liege, Nouiomagum</HI> and <HI>Nieumeghen, Traiectum</HI> on the <HI>Maese</HI> and <HI>Trait</HI> (for which he falsly writes <HI>Trecia</HI>) he suppo∣seth to be two seuerall townes, ech couple; whereas in very deed they signifie but one. The citie <HI>Raremutium</HI> also he most grosly affirmeth to be called <HI>Liege:</HI> and in another place he will needs haue the same <HI>Raremutium</HI> to be named <HI>Rhamon:</HI> but by his description I coniecture, that he meanes by his <HI>Raremutium</HI> and <HI>Rhamon</HI> nothing els but the towne of <HI>Ruermond.</HI> So <HI>Rhenen</HI> a citie of Guelders standing on the banke of the riuer <HI>Rhene,</HI> in regard of the affinitie of name, he takes to be all one with the Bishopricke of <HI>Rhemes</HI> in the Prouince of <HI>Champaigne</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> But being vtterly vnacquainted with the state of our countries, his errors may seeme the more pardonable. Howbeit, lest others, studious in Geography, should fall into the like absurdities, I thought good to annex vnto this page the cōmon synonymas or sundry names of certaine particular places.</P>

<HEAD>The Dukedome of LVTZENBVRG.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His region as we see many others, is so named of <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> the princi∣pall citie: but why it should be thus called, we cannot easilie coniecture. At first it went vnder the title of an Earledome, and afterward was ad∣uanced to the dignitie of a Dukedome, and so till this present continueth. Some say it was thus aduanced by <HI>Wenceslaus</HI> King of the Romans; others, by <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth: howbeit <HI>Conradus Vercerius</HI> ascribes it to <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth, the first Romane Emperour of that family. I finde in ancient manu∣scripts, that the first Earle of <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> was one <HI>Sigisfridus,</HI> and that he was the sonne of <HI>Tacuinus</HI> Duke of <HI>Maesland.</HI></P>
<P>In former times <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> was part of <HI>Triers.</HI> It stretcheth from the wood <HI>Arduen∣na</HI> to <HI>Mosella</HI> (a riuer by <HI>Ausonius</HI> much celebrated.) The countries bordering vpon this Prouince, are part of <HI>France, Loraigne, Metz, Triers, Mamure,</HI> and <HI>Liege.</HI> It is in most places mountainous and woodie; but here and there also well manured: and of late we see their woods euery where turned vp and conuerted into most fruitfull fields. The people are for the greatest part Dutch, and yet their countrie ioyneth hard vpon <HI>France,</HI> and they are accustomed to the language and fashions of the <HI>French.</HI> This Dukedome conteineth in com∣passe, as saith <HI>Guicciardin,</HI> seuentie of our Flemish miles. Within it are seuen Earledomes, many Baronies, and great store of gentlemen. Cities there are with stone walles to the number of twentie three, besides those that the furie of warre hath layd desolate: with <HI>1168.</HI> villages, and sundrie castles of importance.</P>
<P>The principall citie is called <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> or <HI>Lucemburg;</HI> for I find it both wayes writ∣ten, but without any choice: because both the true maner of writing and the deriuation is vn∣certaine. Some thinke of the riuer <HI>Elza</HI> running by this citie (which perhaps was <HI>Antoni∣nus</HI> his <HI>Alizontia</HI>) that it might be called <HI>Elzenburg,</HI> and corruptly <HI>Lelzenburg.</HI> Others referre it to the fabulous historie of the Inchantresse <HI>Melusina.</HI> But my purpose is neither to proue nor disproue such opinions. Here resideth the chiefe Counsell, and the highest Court of iustice. The citie is of sufficient force, but vnequally situate: for standing partly on a hill, and partly in a lowe and steepe valley, it appeares of a very vneuen shape. Then haue you <HI>Arlune</HI> standing on the top of a hill, a towne very beautifull, where at this present are found sundry monuments of antiquitie, which <HI>Count Peter Ernestus</HI> hath caused to be transported to his stately Palace in the citie of <HI>Lutzenburg.</HI> Some are of opinion that the Moone in time past was here after a Gentilish maner adored, and that it was called <HI>Arlune, quasi Ara lunae,</HI> that is, the altar of the moone. Others imagine, that these cities following borowed their names also from the residue of the planets; as <HI>Iuosium</HI> (commonly <HI>Iuoix</HI>) from <HI>Ioue</HI> or <HI>Iupiter; Sathenacum</HI> (now <HI>Soleure</HI>) from <HI>Saturne; Virtonium</HI> (alias <HI>Verton</HI>) from <HI>Venus; Maruilla</HI> (or <HI>Maruille</HI>) from <HI>Mars; Malmedium (Malmedi)</HI> from <HI>Mercurie.</HI> Some interpret <HI>Malmedi, Montem maledictum,</HI> The accursed mountaine; saying that it was so called, because here the Emperour <HI>Valentinian</HI> lost his armie. Next followes <HI>Radema∣cherne.</HI> Also <HI>Thion-uille,</HI> on the banke of <HI>Mosella:</HI> it is the fortresse of the whole region, and a towne most defensible against all hostile attempts. <HI>Grauenmachern</HI> and <HI>Conings∣machern,</HI> two small townes situate vpon the same riuer. <HI>Dechrij</HI> stands vpon the riuer <HI>Saur. Echternach,</HI> containing a famous Abbey. <HI>Vinden</HI> likewise. Also the towne of <HI>Bastoigne,</HI> the principall mart of the whole region, standing neere the wood <HI>Arduenna.</HI> Here you haue in like sort, <HI>Naufchastelle, Danuiller, la Roche,</HI> and <HI>Durbis,</HI> townes not altogether vn∣worthie to be mentioned: as likewise <HI>Sant Vit, Marche, Chiney,</HI> and <HI>Ferta.</HI> All which are more amply described by <HI>Guicciardin. Regino</HI> in his second booke makes mention of mount <HI>Adromare</HI> about <HI>Thion-uille,</HI> where <HI>Charlemaigne</HI> was wont to ride a hunting. More concerning this region you may reade in our Itinerarium or Iournall.</P>

<HEAD>GVELDERLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>VELDERLAND the seat of the ancient <HI>Sicambri</HI> (as most Writers are of opini∣on) hath to the North thereof <HI>Frisland,</HI> together with an inlet of the German sea, commonly called <HI>Suiderzee;</HI> East it confineth vpon the Duchy of <HI>Cleue;</HI> South vpon <HI>Gulick;</HI> and West it affronteth <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> It is a champian coun∣trey, destitute of mountaines, but all ouer replenished with woods and groues. It aboundeth with all necessaries, especially with corne; and their greene ranke medowes yeeld such plentie of feed for cattell, as euen out of the farthest part of <HI>Denmarke</HI> they bring hither their starued droues for succour. It is watered with three famous riuers, namely <HI>Rhijne, Maese,</HI> and <HI>VVaele.</HI> It conteineth the countie of <HI>Zutphen</HI> and the re∣gion called <HI>De Veluvve.</HI> The <HI>Veluwe</HI> is almost an isle, which being situate betweene a branch of <HI>Rhijn</HI> that runnes by <HI>Arnhem,</HI> and the riuer <HI>Yssel,</HI> stretcheth to the Suyder sea; it is meanly fruitfull and not al∣together void of woods, mountaines, and hilles. Some thinke that the inhabitants of this place were woont to be called Caninfates.</P>
<P>The Dukedome of <HI>Guelders</HI> hath two and twentie cities compassed with walles and ditches, and a∣boue three hundred villages. <HI>Nieumegen</HI> vpon the <HI>VVaele</HI> is the Metropolitan; a citie very populous, and gallantly built, &amp; famous in regard of the mint that is there. The greatest part of the citizens vsing trade of merchandize are exceeding rich. The territory of this citie is adorned with the title of a King∣dome. Next followes <HI>Ruremonde,</HI> situate where the riuer <HI>Roer</HI> falles into the <HI>Maese.</HI> It hath in my re∣membrance beene a Bishopricke. <HI>Zutphen,</HI> at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Berkel,</HI> where it dischargeth it selfe into <HI>Yssel.</HI> It beares the title of an Earledome. It hath a rich College of Canons, and is vnder the iurisdiction of the Bishop of <HI>Munster. Arnhen</HI> stands vpon the banke of <HI>Rhijne.</HI> This is the seat of the high Court of iustice, and of the Chancery. The Clergie of this towne are subiect to the Bishop of <HI>Vtrecht.</HI> HATTEM a towne well fortified vpon the riuer <HI>Yssel.</HI> ELBVRG on the shore of the Zuyder sea. HARDERVVIIK, vpon the same shore. Heere likewise you haue WAGENING, TIEL, BOMMEL, BRONCHORST, DOESBVRG, DOTECHEM, SHEERENBERG, gouerned by a peculiar prince vnder the name of an Earledome; LOCHEN, GROLL, BREDEVORD, GELRE which perhaps gaue name to the whole region; STRAELEN, VENLO, a towne vpon the banke of <HI>Maese</HI> fortified both by arte and nature; WACHTENDVNCK, of ancient times the city of <HI>Her∣cules,</HI> in the Dukedome of <HI>Iuliers.</HI> Besides these there are other small townes of note; which though now either by furie of warre, or iniurie of time, they are vnwalled; yet they doe enioy the freedomes and priuileges of cities. Their names be <HI>Keppel, Burg, Genderen, Bateburg, Monteford, Echt, Culeburg,</HI> and <HI>Buren;</HI> both which haue a peculiar Lord as <HI>Bateburg</HI> also. Vnder Earle <HI>Ottho</HI> the third, this region was mightily inlarged; for he compassed with walles, and endowed with priuileges the townes of <HI>Rure∣mond, Arnhem, Harderwijk, Bemel, Goch,</HI> and <HI>VVagening,</HI> which till that time had remained villages. In the Chronicle of <HI>Iohn Reigersbeg</HI> written in Dutch, I finde this region in the time of <HI>Carolus Caluus</HI> to haue beene called by the name of <HI>Ponthis;</HI> and that it was by him in the yeere 878. erected to a Signiorie. Then in the yeere 1079. this Signiorie of <HI>Ponthis</HI> was by <HI>Henrie</HI> the third adorned with the title of an Earledome, and called the Earledome of <HI>Guelders:</HI> and the first Earle thereof was <HI>Otto à Nassau.</HI> It went vnder the name of an Earledome till <HI>Reinhold</HI> the second. But whenas this <HI>Reinhold</HI> not only for his va∣lour and mightinesse grew terrible to his neighbours, but renowmed in regard of his iustice, his piety and fidelity towards the Roman empire; he was at <HI>Frankford</HI> in a solemne and royal assembly by <HI>Lewes</HI> the Emperour consecrated Duke; in presence of the King of <HI>England,</HI> the French King, and the Princes Electours, in the yeere of our Lord 1339.</P>
<P>Some say, that in the time of the Emperour <HI>Carolus Caluus,</HI> towards that place where the towne of <HI>Gelre</HI> now standeth, there was a strange and venimous beast, of huge bignesse and monstrous crueltie, feared all the countrey ouer, which lay for the most part vnder an Oake. This monster wasted the fields, deuoured cattell great and small, and abstained not from men. The inhabitants affrighted with the noueltie and vncouthnesse of the matter, abandoned their habitations, and hid themselues in de∣sert and solitarie places. A certaine Lord of <HI>Ponth</HI> had two sonnes; who partly tendring their owne e∣state, and partly also the distresse of their neighbours, assailed the beast with singular policie and cou∣rage, and after a long combat slew him. The said Lord therefore not farre from the Maese vpon the banke of <HI>Nierson,</HI> for the perpetuall memorie of his sonnes exploit, built a castle which he called <HI>Gelre;</HI> because when the beast was slaine, he often yelled with a dreadfull roaring noise, <HI>Gelre, Gelre:</HI> from whence they say, began the name of the Guelders. Thus much out of the Chronicle of <HI>Henry Aquilius</HI> a Guelder borne. More concerning this Prouince you may reade in <HI>Francis Irenicus;</HI> but a most large description hereof you shall finde in <HI>Guicciardin.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Bishopricke of LIEGE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a common and constant opinion, that those which we now call <HI>Leodien∣ses</HI> or <HI>Ligeois</HI> are a German people named of old <HI>Eburones.</HI> A relique or monument of which ancient name remaineth as yet in the village <HI>Ebure,</HI> a German mile distant from the city of <HI>Liege.</HI> And this very place (as I sup∣pose) is described by <HI>Dion lib. 40.</HI> vnder the name <HI>Eburonia.</HI> Howbeit certaine it is, that the iurisdiction of <HI>Liege</HI> stretcheth much farther than that of the Eburones did of olde. Of the Eburones mention is made by <HI>Strabo, Caesar,</HI> and <HI>Florus. Dion</HI> calles them <HI>Eburos:</HI> and late Writers barbarously terme them <HI>Eburonates.</HI> Themselues in their mother tongue (which is a kinde of broken French) they call <HI>Ligeois:</HI> but in high Dutch <HI>Lutticher,</HI> and <HI>Luyckenaren.</HI> The deriuation of Eburones &amp; Leodienses, whoso desires to know, I re∣fer him to the antiquities of <HI>Goropius Becanus,</HI> and to a small pamphlet of <HI>Hubert Leodius.</HI></P>
<P>This region taketh vp a great part of ancient <HI>Lorraigne:</HI> for it containes vnder the name of the diocesse of <HI>Liege,</HI> the dukedome of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> the marquesat of <HI>Franckmont,</HI> the countie of <HI>Haspengow,</HI> and Loots, and many Baronies. In this region besides <HI>Maestright,</HI> halfe wherof is sub∣iect to the Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> there are foure and twentie walled cities, a thousand seuen hundred Villages, with Churches and many Abbeys and Signiories. The names of the cities are these fol∣lowing; <HI>Liege</HI> vpon <HI>Maese,</HI> the seat of a Bishop, after which all the whole countrey is named: <HI>Bouillon Franchemont, Loots, Borchworm, Tungeren, Huy, Hasselt, Dinant, Ma∣sac, Stoch, Bilsen, S. Truden, Viset, Tuin, Varem, Bering, Herck, Bree, Pera, Ha∣mont, Chiney, Fosse,</HI> and <HI>Couin,</HI> as <HI>Guicciardin</HI> doth both name and number them. More∣ouer <HI>Placentius</HI> writeth, that part of <HI>Maestright</HI> was added to this diocesse by the donation of <HI>Pori</HI> Earle of <HI>Louaine.</HI> The territorie of this citie is called the countie of <HI>Maesland</HI> in the an∣cient records of <HI>Seruatius</HI> abbey, built here by King <HI>Arnulphus</HI> in the yeere <HI>889.</HI> Now this countie is vsually called <HI>Haspengow.</HI></P>
<P>It is a region exceeding pleasant and fertile of all things, especially on the North part, where it ioyneth to <HI>Brabant;</HI> for there it aboundeth with corne and all kinde of fruits, and in some pla∣ces it yeeldeth wine. But on the South frontiers towards <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> it is some∣what more barren, mountainous, and ouerspred with woods; here yet being some remainder of <HI>Ar∣duenna</HI> the greatest forest in all <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Caesar</HI> writeth. This is the outward hiew of the coun∣try; but in the entrals and bowels thereof it is enriched with mettals and sundry kinds of marbles; as also with sea-coales, which they burne in stead of fewell; and all these so surpassing good, as in a common prouerbe they vsually say, that they haue <HI>bread better than bread, fire hotter than fire, and iron harder than iron.</HI> By their iron (than which all the prouinces around vse nei∣ther better nor indeed any other) they raise a great reuenue. Nor with any other more forcible fire do the Smithes and Bearebrewers in all this part of the Low countries heat their furnaces than with these minerall coales of <HI>Liege;</HI> which are of so strange a nature, as water increaseth their flame, but oile puts it out. The smell of this fire or smoke, though it be somewhat loathsome to those that are not accustomed with it, yet salt being cast thereupon, it smelleth either but a little, or not at all. But concerning these coales, you may reade more at large in the Tables of <HI>Namur</HI> and <HI>Henault.</HI></P>
<P>This region they say was conuerted to the faith by <HI>S. Materne</HI> the first Bishop of <HI>Tungeren,</HI> about the yeere of our Lord <HI>101.</HI> For the Bishopricke which is now at <HI>Liege,</HI> was then at <HI>Tun∣geren,</HI> and there continued till the yeere <HI>498,</HI> what time it was by <HI>S. Seruatius</HI> translated to <HI>Maestright;</HI> where it remained till the time of <HI>S. Hubert</HI> the Bishop, who in the yeere <HI>713.</HI> re∣moued it to <HI>Liege,</HI> where it continueth till this present. Touching this Prouince reade more largely in <HI>Guicciardin, Hubert</HI> of <HI>Liege,</HI> and <HI>Placentius.</HI> To whom you may adde <HI>Francis Roserius</HI> his description of <HI>Loraigne.</HI></P>

<HEAD>BRABANT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Dukedome of <HI>Brabant</HI> is in such sort circumscribed by the riuers <HI>Maese, Scheld, Sambre,</HI> and <HI>Dender,</HI> as it no where ouerpasseth them; nor doth it in all places stretch so farre: for on this side the <HI>Maese</HI> lies a great part of the Prouince of <HI>Liege.</HI> But (that we may describe the bounds hereof more perfectly) it hath to the North, <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Guelders;</HI> East, the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege;</HI> South, the counties of <HI>Namure</HI> and <HI>Henault;</HI> and West it is diuided From <HI>Flanders</HI> by the riuer <HI>Scheld.</HI> It is a goodly and pleasant country, exceeding fertill, and abounding with come and fruits of all sorts, especially to the South of the riuer of <HI>Demer.</HI> For the North part thereof, namely <HI>Kempenland,</HI> is somewhat more barren and sandy. Howbeit, this part is not altogether fruitlesse: for <HI>Iacobus Spie∣legius</HI> writing to <HI>Guntherus</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> affirmeth that the husbandmen of <HI>Brabant</HI> are so industrious, as they make the driest sandes to beare wheat. Also to head-cattell and sheepe, the greatest part whereof (as we reade in <HI>Homer</HI> of those <HI>Libyan</HI> sheepe) are horned; it yeelds most pleasant and plentifull pasture. And now by the industry &amp; vncessant labour of the husbandmen it is dayly so manured; that where in times past there was nothing but vnprofitable sand-heaps, you may at this present beholde, to the great benefit of the inhabitants, most fruitfull corne-fields. On the East part of this Prouince there is a kinde of bogge or quagmite called <HI>Peele,</HI> the ground whereof (as <HI>Plinie</HI> reporteth of the fields <HI>Gabiensis</HI> and <HI>Reatinus</HI>) trembleth vnder a mans foot; neither can it be passed by horses or wagons, but only in Winter, when the vpper crust thereof is hardened with frost.</P>
<P>This region containes the Marquesat of the sacred Empire (the chiefe citie whereof is <HI>Antwerpe</HI>) as likewise the Marque∣sat of <HI>Bergis,</HI> the Dukedome of <HI>Arschot,</HI> the Earledomes of <HI>Hochstraten, Megen,</HI> and that of <HI>Cantecroy</HI> lately erected by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, &amp;c. It hath also woods and forests, abounding with wilde beasts of sundry kindes: the principall whereof are <HI>Grootenhout, Grootenheyst, Meerdael, Zauenterloo</HI> and <HI>Soenien</HI> the greatest of all, conteining in it for the space of seuen miles compasse sundry villages &amp; monasteries. Hunting and hawking (except in these fiue woods, which are reserued for the Princes owne game) are free for all men. The people are so iocund, as they seeme scarse to feele the inconueniences of olde age; which frolike disposition of theirs hath giuen occasion to their neighbours round about to vse this iest: <HI>The longer the Brabanter liues, the more foole he.</HI> The aire is exceeding holsome: for when the plague hath beene most vehement in all the regions adiacent, <HI>Brabant</HI> hath often most wonderfully remained free.</P>
<P>This Dukedome of <HI>Brabant</HI> hath six and twentie cities enuironed with walles and ditches. And they are these following: ANTVVERPE situate vpon <HI>Scheld,</HI> the most famous mart not only of <HI>Germanie,</HI> but of all <HI>Europe;</HI> and one of the strongest cities in the world; being much beautified with the steeple of <HI>S. Maries</HI> built an incredible height of white marble. The pa∣lace lately built, is scarse to be matched in all <HI>Europe.</HI> BRVSSEL, abounding with sweet fountaines. Here for the most part resideth the Prince; and therefore is this towne so much frequented by Nobles and Courtiers. LOVAIN, a large city, con∣teining Gardens, Vineyards, and Pastures within the walles: well may you call it The habitation of the Muses; for which purpose in the yeere 1426. <HI>Iohn</HI> the fourth Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> established here an Vniuersitie, which flourisheth with all kind of learning. The territorie of this citie makes <HI>Brabant</HI> to glory of her vintage. Then followes MACHELEN, famous for the court of Parliament there instituted by Duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Burgundie</HI> in the yeere 1473. HERTOGENBOSCH, a towne of no small importance, conteining an excellent Grammar schoole, and inhabited in times past with a most warlike people. TIE∣NEN vpon the riuer <HI>Ghette,</HI> from whence are brought great store of cheeses. Here stands the church of <HI>S. Germans,</HI> whereun∣to belongs a college of Canons. LEVWE, where the noble ale is brewed. NIVELLE. In this citie there is a chanterie of Nunnes, whereinto none but ladies of great nobilitie can be admitted. The Gouernesse of this chantry the Nunnes them∣selues chuse by voices, yet with the consent of the Prince, and the Bishops approbation; and she is called the ladie of <HI>Niuella.</HI> Also the temporall and ecclesiasticall iurisdiction of the towne and adioyning territory soly belongeth vnto her. ARSCHOT, situate on the riuer <HI>Demer,</HI> bearing at first the title of a Marquesat, but since by <HI>Charles</HI> the fift aduanced to a Dukedome. BERGEN <HI>ap Zoom,</HI> so named of a small riuer that runnes thorow it; a towne heeretofore of good traffique, but now by the neighbourhood of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> not so frequented of forren merchants. MEGHEN, situate vpon the <HI>Maese.</HI> BREDA, a towne most fairely built. Here stands the Palace of the Earles of <HI>Nassau,</HI> so gallantly begun by a most skilfull architect, that being once finished, it may (I thinke) be preferred before all the Princes houses in this region. MAESTRIGHT, a large, populous, and rich citie; which though it seemeth to lie without the bounds of <HI>Brabant,</HI> acknowledgeth the Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> as her souereigne Lord. STEENBERGEN vpon the sea-shore. In times past it was a flourishing mart towne; but now it is almost brought to nothing. LIERE, so beautifull and pleasant a towne, as many noble men make choise thereof as a place of recreat and solace. VILVORDEN. Here is a strong fortresse, and the castle of the Duke. GEMBLOVRS. The Abbat of this towne beareth the greatest sway in causes both ecclesiasticall and temporall. IOVDOIGNE for the holesomnesse of the aire in times past the nurserie of the yong Princes of this region. HANVT, heretofore reported to haue beene an Earledome, situate in a most fertile place. LANDEN, esteemed of some the most ancient towne in all <HI>Brabant.</HI> HALEN, almost vtterly ruinated by warres. DIEST, built on either side the riuer <HI>Demer,</HI> a spacious citie, the inhabitants whereof gaine much by clothing. SI∣CHENEN, a towne vpon the same riuer.

<P>Some places here are also which in Dutch we call <HI>Vrijheden,</HI> or Free townes; which though they be not fortified with walles and ditches; yet because they enioy the priuileges and immunities of Princes, we thinke not altogether vnwoorthie the naming: <HI>Osterwijck, Orschot, Turnhout, Hoochstraten, Duffel, Walen, Merchten, Asche, Wernen, Duisbosch, Hulpen, Waure, Braine, Genappe, Gheel, Arendonce,</HI> and <HI>Dormal.</HI> Here are seuen hundred villages, with parish-churches that haue steeples and belles; a great many of which villages are adorned with titles of dignities. Also vnder the gouernment and iu∣risdiction of <HI>Brabant</HI> are certaine regions beyond the <HI>Maese,</HI> as namely the duchy of <HI>Limburg,</HI> the countie of <HI>Dalem,</HI> the state of <HI>Valkenburg,</HI> &amp;c. Besides all which, it hath many other places of importance: but it is not our purpose here to make rela∣tion of all. <HI>Iohn Seruilius</HI> published a briefe treatise as touching a conspiracie of the people of <HI>Guelders</HI> against this countrey of <HI>Brabant,</HI> where you shall finde many furtherances to the better knowledge of this region.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He region of <HI>Namur</HI> is at this present endowed with the title of an Earledome. Whether it was thus named of the principall citie, or that the city assumed this name from the region, remai∣neth as yet vncertaine; as likewise the originall of the word it selfe. The inhabitants call it <HI>Namur,</HI> and the high Dutch <HI>Namen,</HI> but the true signification of the word they are vtterly ignorant of. For those that affirme that an Idol called <HI>Nanus,</HI> was of old worshipped, and deliuered answers and oracles vpon the same hill whereon now the castle of <HI>Na∣mure</HI> is situate, and that afterward, when Christian religion began to shine, this Idol waxing mute or silent, the whole region of <HI>Namure</HI> was so named of <HI>Na∣nus mutus;</HI> do (I thinke) report fables, without the authority of any approoued writers. <HI>Meierus</HI> affirmeth, that anciently it was called <HI>Neumur,</HI> as much to say in Latine as <HI>Nouus murus,</HI> a new wall.</P>
<P>Vpon this region do border the prouinces of <HI>Liege, Brabant, Henault,</HI> and <HI>Lut∣zenburg.</HI> It is watered by <HI>Maese</HI> and <HI>Sambre,</HI> two nauigable riuers. The country is neither mountainous nor plaine; but raised here &amp; there into little hilles, and depressed into valleys: the woods, whereof the greatest is called <HI>Marlaigne,</HI> yeeld plenty of game for Gentlemen. It abounds with things necessary for mans life. Here are many yron-mines. Here also they digge a kinde of stony or minerall coles, which in Dutch we call <HI>Steenkolen:</HI> the inhabitants, as likewise the Ligeois (for they are found with them also) terme them <HI>Hoille;</HI> the learned call them <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as much to say as <HI>Stone-coles.</HI> The nature of these stones is most wonder∣full: for whereas oyle increaseth the flame of all other fewell, these burne more vehemently by casting on water, and are quenched with oyle. With these coles the inhabitants and bordering nations (for they are transported hence into other countries) do make lusty fires: and Black-smithes do soften their yron bet∣ter with this, than with any other fiering. Here are quarries also, out of which are cut marbles of exceeding hardnesse, both blacke, browne, and particoloured; wherewith the churches &amp; houses of the regions adiacent are maruellously ador∣ned. By meanes of which marbles the people of <HI>Namure</HI> reape no small benefit.</P>
<P>This county hath foure walled townes: <HI>Namure, Bouuignes, Charlemont,</HI> and <HI>Ʋallencure.</HI> NAMVRE, as hath beene said, is the principall city, and of late is be∣come the see of a Bishop: it is right commodiously situate, namely at the conflu∣ence or meeting of the riuers <HI>Maese</HI> and <HI>Sambre:</HI> it hath bridges to passe ouer both riuers. Here is the chiefe tribunall of iustice for the whole region. BOVVIG∣NES stands vpon the Westerne banke of <HI>Maese,</HI> a towne in times past glorious for building, and populous for inhabitants; but now so deformed and ruined with often warres, as it hath lost the greatest part of her beauty. CHARLEMONT is a most impregnable castle, so named and built by <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, neere the banke of <HI>Maese,</HI> on the top of an hill, by a village called <HI>Giuet.</HI> Neither is VALEN∣CVRE a towne of small moment. Also within this county, besides diuers Ab∣bies, there are 82. villages, of which <HI>Floreu, Ʋascie, Samson,</HI> and some others, are so large and beautifull, as they may well be compared with townes. This region of old bare the title of a Marquesate: but about the yere 1200. it was conuerted into an Earledome. The people are very warlike, and most loyall to their Prince. They speake French. This region (as the rest of the Lowe countries) is exactly described by <HI>Guicciardine.</HI></P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Essabaeus</HI> writeth (vpon what ground, I know not) that this Prouince was of old cal∣led <HI>Pannonia,</HI> because the rusticke god <HI>Pan</HI> was here worshipped; then <HI>Saltus carbona∣rius</HI> or The cole-forest; and afterward, The lower <HI>Picardie.</HI> But at length it was na∣med <HI>Hannonia</HI> of the riuer <HI>Haysne,</HI> that runnes thorow the midst of it. The inhabi∣tants call it <HI>Henault,</HI> and the Germans <HI>Henegow,</HI> which in the ancient language of the place signifies The field of <HI>Hainault.</HI> For <HI>Gow</HI> in Dutch signifies a field. Another deriuation also of the name of this countrey is produced by <HI>Carolus Bouillus</HI> in his discourse of the variety of vulgar languages.</P>
<P>To the West of this Prouince by <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Artois;</HI> on the North <HI>Brabant;</HI> and <HI>Brabant</HI> againe with part of <HI>Namure</HI> and <HI>Liege</HI> vpon the East; and South it is bounded by <HI>Champaigne</HI> a Prouince of <HI>France.</HI> A country as pleasant, and as well stored with woods, lakes, fountaines, medowes, and pastures, as any other in all these parts. The inhabitants are warlike, and towards their Prince most loyall and seruiceable. Their liber∣tie or freedome they vsually boast of in a common prouerbe, saying: <HI>Pays de Hainault tenu de Dieu &amp; du soleil,</HI> that is, <HI>The Prouince of Henault holds of God and of the sunne.</HI> Which prouerbe <HI>Nicolaus Brontius</HI> in a discourse of his published in commendation of this region, interpreteth in two Latine verses to this effect:
<Q><L>Star-guiding Ioue and Phoebus bright,</L>
<L>Of this place only challenge right.</L></Q> In length it conteineth about twenty, and in bredth sixteene miles. In which space (as <HI>Guicciardin</HI> reporteth) it comprehends foure and twenty townes, and aboue nine hundred and fiftie villages or hamlets. <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> reckons vp in this Prouince two thousand two hundred petie villages with Churches and steeples. At this present it beareth the title of an Earledome: and it containes within it one Princedome, eight inferi∣our Earledomes, twelue Peeres, two and twentie Baronies, six and twentie Abbeys, with other titles of dig∣nitie, which are to be seene in <HI>Guicciardine.</HI></P>
<P>The principall cities are <HI>Mons</HI> and <HI>Valenchienes:</HI> the last whereof situate vpon the riuer <HI>Scheld,</HI> where it be∣gins to be nauigable for boats and barks, is a towne very large and strongly walled. The townesmen for the most part imploy themselues in trade of merchandise; and reape exceeding gaines by a kinde of cloth which they call <HI>Fussets,</HI> great quantitie whereof is wouen in this citie, and carried from hence to the furthest parts of the world. <HI>Mons</HI> standeth vpon the little riuer <HI>Trouille,</HI> almost in the very midst of all the region. A towne very sufficiently fortified against all hostile attempts. The citizens enrich themselues by a kinde of stuffe commonly called Saye, whereof great abundance is here made. Here are besides the townes of <HI>Condet, Halle, Angie, Maubeuge, Auesne, Beaumont, Chimay, Quercey,</HI> the retiring place of <HI>Mary,</HI> sister to Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, who built there a most stately and sumptuous Palace, which was then highly esteemed; but afterward by the French King <HI>Henry</HI> the second quite burned and defaced. Here also is <HI>Bauacum</HI> commonly called <HI>Bauais,</HI> which some thinke to be <HI>Baganum</HI> or <HI>Bagacum</HI> mentioned by <HI>Ptolemey.</HI> Others are of opinion, that <HI>Caesar</HI> in his commentaries calles it <HI>Belgium.</HI> Howbeit <HI>Hubert</HI> of <HI>Liege</HI> thinks it not to haue been so migh∣tie in <HI>Caesars</HI> time, but rather most of all to haue flourished vnder <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour: which he ga∣thereth by the ancient coines here dayly digged vp in great quantitie, with the said Emperours image vp∣on them. In the market-place of this towne stands a pillar of stone, at the foot whereof the inhabitants say that all those wayes begin, which with an high and direct passage extend from hence to all parts of <HI>France.</HI> These wayes (they say) were made by <HI>Brunchild.</HI> And euen till this day they are called after his name. For the French commonly term them <HI>Chemins de Brune hault;</HI> albeit the high Dutch call them <HI>de Rasije.</HI> There are as yet extant in sundry places some broken remainders of these wayes. <HI>Bouillus</HI> noteth certaine wonders of them; namely, that they are higher than the fields on either side; that they lie most directly betweene the principall townes of <HI>France;</HI> and that they are paued with flint-stones, whereof all the fields adiacent are de∣stitute: so that with admiration a man may imagine, that these flints either sprang out of the earth, or rai∣ned downe from heauen, or by a greater force than mans hand were gathered all the world ouer for the grauelling of these wayes. Also vpon the frontiers of this region towards the riuer <HI>Maese,</HI> in the way to <HI>France,</HI> you haue <HI>Charlemont, Marieburg,</HI> and <HI>Philippeuille,</HI> most strong garrisons against the incursions of the French: being built and so named by Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, by <HI>Mary</HI> his sister, and by K. <HI>Philip</HI> his sonne.</P>
<P>This region aboundeth with iron and lead-mines. Heere are found also sundry kindes of marbles; as blacke, white, and particoloured; right commodious for the adorning of the palaces and sepulchres of Kings and great Nobles. Likewise here is digged great plentie of lime. Also a kinde of stony and blacke coales, hardened in the nature of pitch, which the inhabitants vse for fewell in stead of wood. And heere also are made those thin transparent panes of glasse, by meanes whereof vnseasonable windes and weather are fenced out of houses and churches; and this glasse excelleth all other that is made in any place besides. More you may reade in <HI>Guicciardine,</HI> and in a peculiar discourse that <HI>Iacobus Lessabaeus</HI> hath written of this re∣gion.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat the Atrebates were not the meanest people of <HI>Gallia Belgica, Caesar</HI> himselfe is witnesse. They are and haue beene a warlike nation, retaining as yet their ancient name. The head citie called in Latine <HI>Atrebatum,</HI> was of olde the Metropolitan also of <HI>Flanders;</HI> now it is named in French <HI>Arras,</HI> whereof the region adiacent and all the whole Prouince is called <HI>Artois,</HI> as if you would say <HI>Arratois,</HI> casting away the middle syllable. Hereupon by a new Latine name they call it <HI>Artesia.</HI> The whole region was by <HI>S. Lewis</HI> the French King adorned with the title of an Earledome: and the first Earle thereof was <HI>Robert</HI> the same Kings brother, as writeth <HI>Vignier.</HI> It is very large, extending from the frontiers of <HI>Cambresis, Picardie, Henault,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> euen to the Ocean sea. It was in times past subiect to the Crowne of <HI>France;</HI> but now by meanes of the peace betweene Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and <HI>Francis</HI> the first the French King, concluded 1529, it is an absolute state of it selfe. It hath two fa∣mous cities, namely, <HI>Arras</HI> and <HI>S. Omer:</HI> the principall townes be <HI>Ayre, Hesdin, Lens, Bethune, Bappames, S. Paul, Lillers,</HI> and <HI>Perne;</HI> all which places are subiect to the King Catholike. The cities of <HI>Boulogne, Calais, Guisnes,</HI> and <HI>Ardres</HI> (which are also within the bounds of this Countie) are the French Kings: for <HI>Pontieu</HI> is now abolished. It hath also diuers fortresses and strong holds, besides an incredible number of noblemens castles, which they vse for dwelling houses. It contained of olde two famous bishopricks, namely <HI>Arras</HI> and <HI>Ponthieu:</HI> but since, <HI>Ponthieu</HI> in the yere 1553. was vtterly destroyed, the iurisdiction thereof was distributed to three Episcopall seas; namely, <HI>S. Omer,</HI> and <HI>Ypre</HI> for the one halfe, and <HI>Boulogne</HI> for the residue. Bailiwicks or Hundreds, being the principall members or parts of the whole Countie, it hath nine; namely, that of <HI>Arras,</HI> of <HI>S. Omer,</HI> of <HI>Ponthieu,</HI> of <HI>Ayre, Hesdin, Lens, Bappames, Auen, Bredenard,</HI> and <HI>Aubignie.</HI> Vnder the Baili∣wicke of <HI>Arras</HI> are comprized <HI>Boulogne, S. Paul, Perne, Bethune,</HI> and <HI>Lilers;</HI> but <HI>Calais, Guisnes,</HI> and <HI>Ardres</HI> doe by ancient right belong to <HI>S. Omer.</HI> Likewise the Earle of <HI>Artois</HI> had other inferiour Earles to his vassals, as namely, the Earle of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> of <HI>S. Paul,</HI> of <HI>Arcques,</HI> of <HI>Blangie,</HI> of <HI>Faukenberge,</HI> and of <HI>Syneghen.</HI> Now also it is augmented with the Princedome of <HI>Espinee,</HI> and the Marquesate of <HI>Renty.</HI> But how <HI>Boulogne</HI> first exempted it selfe from the iurisdiction of <HI>Artois,</HI> it is manifest out of histories: for after a certaine Earle of <HI>Boulogne</HI> was attainted of treason against the French King, the King vpon that occasion seizing vpon his Earldom, it euer since denied homage vnto <HI>Artois.</HI> Wherefore the Earle of <HI>Artois</HI> losing the one halfe of his right, assumed directly to himselfe homage or fealty ouer the county of <HI>S. Paul</HI> (which before was feudatarie to the Earle of <HI>Boulogne</HI>) saying often times, that he would not be depriued both of his homage and vnder-homage: so that hitherto the Princes on both sides haue vsed this custom; namely, that <HI>Boulogne</HI> no more acknowledgeth <HI>Ar∣tois,</HI> nor <HI>S. Paul Boulogne.</HI> Howbeit about this point in the latter treaty of peace 1559. there was some variance; wherefore the matter being referred to Commissioners, remaines as yet vndecided, the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hol∣ding still possession. It is commonly supposed, that <HI>Calais</HI> (the next port of the continent vnto <HI>England</HI>) was by <HI>Caesar</HI> called <HI>Portus Iccius,</HI> from whence he sailed out of <HI>France</HI> thither. But if we more thorowly consider the matter, we shall finde it to haue beene another Port, namely, the towne of <HI>Saint Omer,</HI> which that it was of old an hauen and a most large inlet of the Ocean sea, euen the high cliffes, which in a maner enuironing the citie, do plainly demonstrate, besides infinit other arguments and reliques of antiquitie, which (though no man should affirme it) do most euidently conuince, that the territorie adiacent was in times past coue∣red with sea; the trueth whereof is till this day also confirmed by common and constant report. Yea <HI>Sithieu</HI> the ancient name of the citie (for who knowes not that the name of <HI>S. Omer</HI> is but new) manifesteth the same. As if it were deriued of <HI>Sinus Itthius</HI> or <HI>Iccius.</HI> Also that the said haue was in the prouince of the <HI>Morini,</HI> which <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Lucan</HI> doe call the farthest people. And that this is most true, an attentiue Reader may by many arguments easily gather both out of <HI>Caesar</HI> his entrance and returne from <HI>England.</HI> Neither can the space of thirtie miles or thereabout, which he sayth the island is there distant from the maine, hinder my beliefe in this point; whenas the violence of the sea (especially in so narrow a place) may easily either adde or diminish. Nor doth the distance of the sea there from the maine to the continent much differ. Sufficeth thus much to haue beene said concerning <HI>Portus Iccius.</HI> Whether we haue hit the trueth or no, let others iudge. Moreouer, this Prouince hath three Bishopricks, to wit, <HI>Arras, S. Omer,</HI> and <HI>Boulogne;</HI> one and twen∣tie Abbeys, and seuen Nunries; besides many Couents and Hospitals. It hath many riuers also; the prin∣cipall whereof are <HI>Lys, Scarpe, Aa, Canche,</HI> and <HI>Authy,</HI> besides others that are nauigable.</P>
<P>Great is the number of villages and hamlets thorowout the whole prouince. The soile is most fertile and abundant of all corne, and especially of wheat. Wherefore in the ancient French tongue some write it was called <HI>Atrech,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The land of bread.</HI> Nor is it destitute of woods and groues, especially towards the South and West. The garments of the Atrebates or Artesians <HI>S. Ierome</HI> in his second booke against <HI>Io∣uinian</HI> noteth for precious. Also the Artesian mantles <HI>Vopiscus</HI> celebrateth in the life of the Emperour <HI>Cari∣nus.</HI> Likewise the same <HI>Ierome</HI> and other authours affirme, that in his time it rained wooll in this prouince. This region, as others also adioyning, <HI>Guicciardin</HI> hath most notably described.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He extreme part of <HI>Europe,</HI> opposite to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> enuironed by <HI>France, Germanie,</HI> and the Ocean, is called by the inhabitants, The low coun∣tries, or lower <HI>Germanie:</HI> but the French and all strangers in a maner call it by the name of <HI>Flanders.</HI> But in very deed <HI>Flanders</HI> hath not so great extension. For albeit <HI>Flanders</HI> properly so called was larger in times past; yet at this pre∣sent it is bounded by <HI>Brabant, Henault, Artois,</HI> and the Ocean sea. This they diuide into three parts, namely, <HI>Flanders</HI> the Dutch, the French, and the Imperiall; which last part (because it neuer acknowledged any superior, besides the Prince of <HI>Flanders</HI>) they name also <HI>Flan∣ders</HI> proprietarie. The Dutch <HI>Flanders</HI> hath these cities; <HI>Gant, Bruges, Yperen, Cortrijck, Oudenard</HI> with <HI>Pammele, Newport, Furnas, Bergen, Sluise, Damme, Bierflet, Dixmud, Cassel, Dunkerke, Greueling, Burburch,</HI> and <HI>Hulst.</HI> The French <HI>Flanders, L'isle, Doway,</HI> and <HI>Orchies.</HI> And <HI>Flanders</HI> Imperiall or Proprietary, <HI>Aelst, Dendermond, Geertsberg,</HI> and <HI>Ninouen.</HI> The principall riuers are <HI>Scheld, Lys,</HI> and <HI>Dender.</HI> Most part of the region is pa∣sture-ground, especially towards the West: it breedeth faire oxen, and most excellent and warlike horses. It abounds with butter and cheese; and yeeldeth wheat in abundance. The inhabitants are most of them merchants: and of flax (wherof they haue in <HI>Flanders</HI> great plenty, &amp; excellent good) and wooll (which is brought them out of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>England</HI>) they make great quantity of linnen and woollen cloth, which they disperse farre and wide. This Prouince of <HI>Flanders</HI> hath <HI>28.</HI> walled cities, <HI>1154</HI> villages, besides fortresses, castles, and noble mens houses. Among which <HI>Gaunt</HI> is the greatest citie. Whereof <HI>Erasmus</HI> of <HI>Roterdam</HI> in his Epistles writeth in maner following: I am of opinion (saith he) if you looke all Christendome ouer, you shall not finde a citie comparable to this, either for largenesse and strength, or for the ciuill gouernment and towardlinesse of the people. So far <HI>Erasmus.</HI> It containeth in compasse three Dutch miles. It is watered by three riuers, which diuide it into twenty inhabited isles. For multitude and beauty of houses <HI>Bruges</HI> excelleth almost all the cities of the Netherlands; so famous a mart in times past, as (saith <HI>Iacobus Marchantius</HI>) by that meanes the name of <HI>Flanders</HI> obscured all the regions round about. <HI>Yperen</HI> stands vpon the riuer of <HI>Yperlee,</HI> very commodious for Fullers. By clothing it grew in times past to an huge big∣nesse, till the English and men of <HI>Gaunt</HI> besieging it, cast downe the large suburbs, and greatly dimi∣nished the same.</P>
<P>As it is sayd in a common prouerbe, that <HI>Millan</HI> for a Dukedome excelles all Christendome; so doth <HI>Flanders</HI> for an Earledome. It hath certaine prerogatiues: for the Prince thereof writes him∣selfe Earle of <HI>Flanders</HI> by the grace of God: which clause is proper to the stile of Kings. For it is giuen <HI>(saith Meierus)</HI> to no Duke, Marques, or Earle in Christendome, but only to him of <HI>Flan∣ders:</HI> whenas all others vsually adde, <HI>By the clemency,</HI> or <HI>By the assistance of God,</HI> &amp;c. He had in times past sundry officers peculiar to a King; as namely his Chancellour, his Master of the horse, his Chamberlain, and his Cupbearer; also two Marshals and ten Peeres, as in <HI>France.</HI> The armes of this region in times past were a scutcheon Azure, diuided by fiue Crosse-barres of golde with another small red scutcheon in the midst. Now it is a blacke lion in a golden field; which some are of opinion, he tooke for his armes, together with the other Netherlandish Princes, when they set forth on their expedition towards <HI>Syria</HI> in the company of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Elsas:</HI> for at that time the princes of <HI>Flanders, Louaine, Holland, Lutzenburg, Limburg, Brabant, Zeland, Fris∣land, Henault,</HI> &amp;c. changing their ancient armes, assumed to themselues lions of diuers colours.</P>
<P>The greater part of <HI>Flanders</HI> was from the beginning vnder protection of the French Kings; but now it is at libertie, and absolute of it selfe; being released by Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, Earle of <HI>Flanders:</HI> who in the treatie of <HI>Madrid</HI> quite shooke off the French yoke.

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Euinus Lemnius</HI> of <HI>Zirichzee,</HI> in his booke <HI>De occultis naturae miraculis,</HI> Of the bidden secrets of Nature, amongst other things writeth thus of <HI>Zeland,</HI> his natiue country: That this Marine tract, saith he, was notvnknowne vnto the ancients, it may out of <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> easily be gathered; although not by the same name, that at this day it is knowne by: but of a custome and common kind of salutation and speaking one to another, which acquaintance and friends of this prouince do vse at their meetings: therefore he calleth them by the name of <HI>MATTIACI,</HI> when he thus writeth: <HI>In the same iurisdiction are the</HI> Mattiaci, <HI>a nation very like the</HI> Bataui, <HI>but that those, in re∣gard of the situation of their countrie, are more desperate and couragious.</HI> Whereby he giueth to vnderstand, that although they are next neighbours and do border vpon the <HI>Bataui</HI> or Hollan∣ders, (so called of the hollownesse and lownesse of the ground) so that they might iustly be ac∣counted one and the same people, yet are only distinguished by the name of their customary saluation; and being neerer the Sea, are more hardie and audacious; (as indeed they are,) and for manhood, witte, policy, craft, deceits, cunning in buying and selling, and diligence in getting, and waies to enrich themselues, they do farre excell them. And in that hee calleth them <HI>Mattiaci,</HI> I conceiue it, that they were not so named either of any place or captaine, but of that fellowlike salutation, as I said, and vsuall maner of speaking one to another vsuall amongst them, to witte, of <HI>Maet,</HI> which in common speach and friendly meetings, signifieth a fellow and companion in all our actions, bargaines, contracts, and dangers; of all our purposes, coun∣sailes, labours and trauailles: a copartner and consort in any thing whatsoeuer we take in hand or go about, &amp;c. For the name of <HI>Zeland</HI> is not ancient, but is lately inuented, and made of Sea and Land, as who would say <HI>Sea-land,</HI> a country or land bordering vpon the sea: for it is enclosed round with the ocean, consisting of fifteene Ilands, although it be not long since the raging Sea did great hurt in this country, by whose violence and ouerflowing, a good part of <HI>Zeland,</HI> (his dammes, walles and banks being rent and broken downe,) was ouercome of the salt-water and laid leuell with the sea: notwithstan∣ding certaine of them do remaine, of which especially three do continually wrestle with the boisterous billowes of the sea, and do very hardly defend themselues with infinite costs and charges against this rude and vnruly element. Of these first <HI>Wal∣cheren (Walachria)</HI> doth offer it selfe to the eie of such as do saile to these coasts; so named either of him that first entered and inhabited in it, or (as I gesse) of the Gaulls <HI>(Galli)</HI> which much frequented this country; who of the Low-countrie-men are yet called <HI>Walen;</HI> or of that part of <HI>Brittaine</HI> which lieth vpon the West side of it, and is called <HI>Wales,</HI> the most gentleman∣like and brauest nation (you may beleeue him,) amongst the English, and descended also from the Gaulles, which their lan∣guage as yet doth manifest &amp;c. From hence Northward or somewhat declining toward the East is <HI>Scouwen <HI>Scaldia,</HI></HI> the Latines call it of the riuer <HI>Sceldt,</HI> which runneth by it and heere falleth into the sea &amp;c. <HI>Suytheuelandt,</HI> so named of the situa∣tion of it toward the South (to distinguish it from another distant from it Northward and therefore called <HI>Noortheuelandt</HI>) a large and most goodly tract of ground, coasting along the shore of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> although of late yeares hauing suf∣fered great dammage and losse, it is now much lesse and narrower. Thus farre <HI>Lemnius. Tritthemius</HI> in the Annalles of the Franks nameth <HI>Middleborough</HI> the chiefe city of these Ilands <HI>Mesoburgus Meyer;</HI> calleth it <HI>Mattiacum,</HI> more like a Latinist, then a true Geographer. More of these thou maist read in the forenamed <HI>Lemnius,</HI> who hath most excellently well described all the Ilands of <HI>Zeland,</HI> and the cities of the same. To these if thou wilt, thou maist adioine <HI>Lewis Guicciardine,</HI> and I know not what els thou canst seeke for further satisfaction. There are also certaine Annalles of these Ilands, written in the mother tongue by <HI>Iohn Reygersberg.</HI> But for an incomme, thou maist also to these former adde the descriptions of the cities of the Low-countries, done by <HI>Adrian Barland.</HI> Of the people of this prouince these verses are commonly spoken:
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Crescit nequitia, simul crescente senectâ;</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Zelandinis non fallit regula talis.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The worse they wax, as they grow old;</L>
<L>In Zelanders this rule doth hold.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>These Ilands are situate between the mouthes of the riuers <HI>Maese</HI> and <HI>Sceldt,</HI> bordering on the North vpon <HI>Holland,</HI> on the East vpon <HI>Brabant,</HI> on the South vpon <HI>Flanders;</HI> on the West vpon the Germane sea. <HI>Iames Meyer</HI> thinketh that <HI>Proco∣pius</HI> calleth these <HI>Arboricas.</HI> Yet <HI>Petrus Diuaeus</HI> is of opinion that this place of <HI>Procopius</HI> is corrupt, and for <HI>Arborichas</HI> it ought to be read and written, <HI>Abroditos.</HI></P>
<P>That these are those Ilands, I do verily beleeue, vnto which <HI>Caesar,</HI> in his sixth booke <HI>De bello Gallico,</HI> affirmeth that he for∣ced a part of the army of <HI>Ambiorix</HI> Prince of the <HI>Eburones:</HI> which, as his owne words do giue to vnderstand, did hide them∣selues in Ilands, which the continuall motion, or ebbing and flowing of the sea had made. It is also very probable that <HI>Lu∣cane</HI> in his first booke aimed at these Isles, in these his verses: <HI>Qua{que} iacet littus dubium, quod terra fretum{que} Vendicat alter∣nis vicibus, cùm funditus ingens Oceanus, vel cùm refugis se fluctibus aufert. Ventus ab extremo pelagus sic axe volutat, &amp;c.</HI> — They come in troopes amaine, From where th'vncertaine shore doth lie, that is nor sea nor land, But both, by course, as raging <HI>Tethys</HI> flow'th and ebb'th againe: Or as the wind with rowling waues all calm'd doth stand, From North to South thus carrying to and fro: &amp;c. And that which the same Authour in his ninth booke sometime did speake of the <HI>Syrtes</HI> or Quicksands, one may now not altogether vnfitly applie to these Ilands, where he thus speaketh, — <HI>Primam mun∣do Natura figuram Cum daret, in dubio terrae pelagi{que} reliquit: Nam ne{que} subsedit penitus quo stagna profundi Acciperet, necse defendit ab aequore tellus: Ambigua sed lege loci iacet inuia sedes.</HI> When as this massie world by Nature first was fram'd, A doubtfull case it seem'd how God would haue it nam'd: For neither could the earth receiue the ocean deep, Nor land well able was his owne from sea to keep: The place so dangerous is, that none to it dare go; And whether sea or land it be, men skarce do know. Yet now these our Ilands are habitable, and easie and safely to be come vnto, by the industrie and labour of man, and not by the benefit and nature of the place.</P>

<HEAD>HOLLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hus <HI>Erasmus</HI> of <HI>Roterodam,</HI> an Hollander doth describe <HI>Holland,</HI> his natiue country: Most learned men, saith he, do agree in this, and that vpon great probabil ty, that that iland of the Rhein vpon the maine sea, which <HI>Tacitus</HI> maketh mention of in his 20. booke, is the same that now they call HOLLAND. A land that I must alwaies both highly commend &amp; reue∣rence, as to whom indeed I owe my life and natiuitie: And I would to God that it lay in my power to do it againe as great credit, as it hath done me honour and good, for the which I am much bound to praise the Lord. For in that that Martiall doth accuse this nation <HI>rusticitatis,</HI> of clownish simplicity; and that in that <HI>Lucane</HI> calleth the same <HI>trucem,</HI> rough and vnciuill, either it is nothing to vs, or els I deeme both to be interpreted as a great commendation vnto the same. For what nation in former times hath not been somewhat rude and vnciuill? or when were the Romanes more to be com∣mended, then when they knew no other art or mysterie but husbandrie and discipline of warre? If so be that those things which then were said of the Hollanders, some man shall stand in they may be verified of them now; what greater praise can be attributed to <HI>Holland,</HI> my natiue country, then if it may truly be said to loath those iests of <HI>Martiall,</HI> which he himselfe calleth <HI>nequitias,</HI> knaueries? And I would to God that all Christians had such eares, as these Hollanders had, that they might either not enter∣taine those pestilent conceits of that Poet, or at the leastwise would not be delighted with them. If any man please to call this clownishnesse, we do wil∣lingly beare that slanderous reproch, as being a thing common to vs with the good Lacedemonians, with the old Sabines &amp; the worthy Catoes, so much commended. And <HI>Lucane,</HI> as I thinke, called the Hollanders <HI>truces,</HI> rough, in no other sense then <HI>Virgill</HI> calleth the Romane <HI>acer,</HI> stout and hardie. Other∣wise if any man do respect their homely and plaine maners, there is no nation more prone to ciuility and curteous humanity, in which there is lesse cruel∣ty or surly sternnesse; they are of a good nature, plaine, void of all trechery and guile, inclined to no notorious vices: only they are a little too much giuen to their pleasure, especially in banquetting: the reason of which I iudge to be the wonderfull plenty of all maner of things prouoking them thereunto: and that partly by reason of the forrein commodities brought vnto them, for that not only it possesseth the two mouths of the goodly riuers <HI>Maese</HI> and <HI>Rhein,</HI> but also for that the greatest part of this West coast is continually washed with the maine sea: partly by reason of the naturall fertility of the countrie, which euery where is watered with many great and nauigable riuers well stored with fish, and so hath abundance of pastorage and most fatte meadowes. Moreouer the fennes and woods affoord infinite store of wild-foule: and therefore they constantly affirme that there is no country in the world, which in so little compasse and plot of ground conteineth more cities and townes, not very big in quantity and circuite, but for state of common∣wealth and gouernment excellent. For cleanlinesse and near keeping of their houses, the Hollanders do beare away the bell from all other nations whatsoeuer, by the iudgement of Merchants which haue trauelled ouer the greatest part of the world. Of meane learned men there is no where greater plenty. The reason why many of them come not to the height of that exquisite learning, especially of the ancients, is their wanton and riotous life, or for that they esteeme more of honesty and vertue, then great learning: For it cannot be denied but that they haue good wits, as is manifest by many argu∣ments: although indeed it doth not appeare by me, whose gift that way is not great, as in nothing els. Thus farre <HI>Erasmus</HI> in his <HI>Chiliades.</HI></P>
<P>This country of <HI>Holland</HI> almost wholly enclosed like a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> with the sea, and the mouths of the riuers <HI>Maes</HI> and <HI>Rhein,</HI> is not very large, as being in compasse not more then 60. Dutch miles: yet it comprehendeth 29. walled cities, which are these, DORDRECHT, about an hundred yeares since by a deluge and ouerflowing of the sea made an iland: by this 4. riuers do runne. It is a mightie city, inhabited of very wealthy citizens, and beautified with most gallant buildings both publike and priuate. Heere is a great concourse of Merchants: for in it is held the staple of Rhenish wine, corne, timber, and other wares and merchandice which are brought downe by the <HI>Maes</HI> and <HI>Rhein</HI> into these countries to be sold. HAERLEM; this is the most stately and greatest citie of all <HI>Holland,</HI> situate in a most pleasant place. Hard without the town walls is a very fine groue, whither the citizens vpon festiuall daies, do withdraw themselues, for their pleasure and recreation, after their labour and toilesome busines. This town is famous for clothing, where it is cer∣taine that there are tenne or twelue thousand clothes yearely made. Heere the citizens do perswade themselues the mysterie of printing was first inuented and practised. DELET, so named of <HI>Delft,</HI> which in their language signifieth a ditch. Heere also the townesmen vse clothing. Moreouer in this city, they brue good beere, which from hence in great plenty is transported into <HI>Zeland.</HI> This towne in the yeare 1536. suffered great losse by fire, the greatest part of it being vtterly defaced. LEIDEN, vpon the <HI>Rhein,</HI> not far from his mouth where it sometime did fall into the sea, which now you may perceiue to be stopped &amp; choaked with sand. It is thought to be the most ancient city of this prouince: for some do thinke it to haue beene so named of a Roman legion which sometime wintered in this place. Certaine antiquities are heere yet to be seene to this day. GOVDE vpon the riuer <HI>Isel,</HI> in that place where it meeteth with the riuer <HI>Goude</HI> or <HI>Gouwe,</HI> whereof the city tooke his name. It is very populous. AMSTELREDAM, most stately built vpon the inlet or bay called <HI>Tie,</HI> the most populous and frequent Mart towne of all these parts. In euery street almost, like as in <HI>Venice,</HI> a man may passe from place to place, by boate aswell as by foot, to dispatch his businesse. Heere daily from <HI>Norway, kussia,</HI> and other Northren countries, as also from <HI>Spaine, France, England,</HI> &amp;c. great store of shippes do arriue and ancher; so that sometimes you shall see at once two hundred or three hundred faile of Mer∣chants shippes (<HI>hulks</HI> they call them) to ride heereat anchor. Therefore this city for traffique, is commonly held to yeeld to none but <HI>Antwerp.</HI> EN∣CKHVISEN, vpon that sea, which they vulgarly call in their language <HI>Suyderzee.</HI> Famous euen in forren countries for the building of great shippes. HOORN, situate also vpon the same bay. Heere in May is kept a faire, where there is sold such infinite store of butter and cheese, as is wonderfull. ALKMAER; this place for plenty of butter and cheese doth excell all other cities of this prouince. PVRMERENDE, famous for the castle or palace of the Count <HI>Egmond.</HI> EDAM, for building of shippes and good cheese, deserueth also to be remembred amongst the rest. Moreouer MVNNEKENDAM, WEESP, NAERDEN, and WEERT may not be forgotten. OVDEVVATER, heere groweth great store of hemp, so that heere they make almost all the nets, ropes and cables which the Hollanders and Zelanders do vse in fishing. SCOONHOVEN; as who would say, At the faire Orchards. Here is continuall fishing for Salmons, where also is held a Staple of this commodity, as we said there was of wine at <HI>Dordrecht.</HI> Next after these do follow I∣SELSTEIN, VIANEN: Item LEERDAM, ASPEREN, and HVEKELEN, three little cities round in a circle vpon the riuer <HI>Lingen,</HI> not about 500. pases one from another. GORICVM and WORICHVM, situate, vpon the banke of the riuer <HI>Wael,</HI> one ouer against another. <HI>Gorichum</HI> hath a very goodly and beautifull castle. A man may iustly call this town a city of store of all maner prouision: such a market is heere daily kept of such things as are necessary for the sustenance of mans life, which are from thence transported by shippe vnto other countries, but especially to <HI>Antwerp:</HI> Lastly, there are HVESDEN, ROTERODAM, SCHIEDAM, and both the MOVNTS, the one known by the name of <HI>S. Gertrude,</HI> the other of the number of Se∣uen; <HI>Seuenbergen</HI> I meane, and <HI>Geertruydenberge,</HI> for so they call them. Other towns there are, which sometime were walled: which although at this day we do now see them to want, either by the rage of violent warre, or by reason of other misfortunes, yet they still enioy their old liberties and fredoms. Of this sort <HI>Medenblick Beuerwijck, Muiden, Neuport, Vlaerdingen,</HI> and <HI>Grauesande.</HI> Moreouer in this prouince there are aboue foure hundred villages, amongst the which the <HI>Haghe,</HI> (which they call <HI>Earls Haghe</HI>) doth farre excell the rest. This town <HI>Guicciardine</HI> thinketh for bignesse, wealth, beauty and pleasant situation to surpasse all other in <HI>Europe</HI> whatsoeuer: for it conteineth two thowsand houses: of which the Princes pallace, built like a castell for∣tified with a wall and dich, where the Priuy courts of Iustice are held, is one. Neere vnto is a darke or thicke grone, which by reason of the singing of birds, and sight of Deere, is both to the eares and eies most pleasant and delightfull. I might more iustly call it <HI>Comopolis,</HI> a citie like town; and may boldly compare it with <HI>Ctesiphon</HI> a borough in <HI>Assyria,</HI> situate vpon the riuer <HI>Tigris,</HI> much magnified of all ancient writers: of which <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that that town is equall to a city for command and bignesse, and was the place where the Parthian kings did vse to winter, when they were desirous to spare the city of <HI>Seleucia.</HI></P>
<P>Vnder the Iurisdiction also of <HI>Holland</HI> are certaine Ilands, as <HI>Voorn,</HI> (with the towns <HI>Geervliet,</HI> and <HI>Briele,) Goereden,</HI> or <HI>Goere,</HI> (with a town of the same name: <HI>Somersdijcke, Tenel,</HI> &amp; diuers others. The diocesse of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> gouerned not long since by a Bishop, in which were 5. cities, yeelded it selfe to be subiect to the iurisdiction of <HI>Holland,</HI> in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth Emperour of <HI>Rome.</HI> This country is so enclosed with the sea, seuered by riuers, lakes, creeks and ditches, whereby it is diuided as it were into certaine plots and quarters, that there is no city nor village heere, to which one may not go aswell by water as by waggon. Neither is there any place in the whole prouince, from whence one may not easily in three houres space, go to the sea. <HI>Chrysostomus Neapolitanus</HI> hath described this <HI>Olland,</HI> (for so he writeth it) in an eloquent letter of his directed to <HI>Counte Nugarolo.</HI> Of this read the hi∣story of <HI>Holland,</HI> compiled by <HI>Gerardus Geldenhaurius</HI> and <HI>Cornelius Aurelius,</HI> as also <HI>Peter Diuey,</HI> but especially <HI>Hadrianus Iunius</HI> his <HI>Batauia.</HI> Of the wonderfull store and abundance of this country, read <HI>Lud. Guicciardine.</HI> Of the ruines of the Roman armory or storehouse of munition, which the country people call, The Brittish castle, (which is vpon the shore of the Germane ocean, at a village called <HI>Catwijcke opzee,</HI> not far from the city <HI>Leijden</HI>) and of the inscriptions in marble there found, we haue not long since set forth a peculiar treatise dedicated only to that argument.</P>
<P>Of the prouince of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> which now is vnder the command of <HI>Holland,</HI> and is likewise described in this Mappe, see the history of <HI>Lambertus. Hor∣tensius Monfortius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>FRIESLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat the <HI>Frisij,</HI> a most ancient nation, did long since inhabit along the sea coast, neere the mouth of the riuer of <HI>Rhein,</HI> where also at this day they dwell, it is very apparant out of the records of ancient writers. For <HI>Ptolemey</HI> placeth them aboue the <HI>Busactores</HI> (or <HI>Busacteri,</HI> the people of that prouince which now is called <HI>Westfalia,</HI> as some thinke) between the ri∣uers <HI>Vidrus,</HI> (they call it <HI>Regge</HI>) and <HI>Amasius,</HI> now called <HI>Eems. Tacitus,</HI> who reporteth that they were of good account amongst the Germanes, and along by the sea coast to dwell on ech side the <HI>Rhein:</HI> diuideth them according to their power and greatnes of command, into <HI>Maiores</HI> and <HI>Minores,</HI> the Greater and the Lesser: hee moreouer affirmeth that they dwell round about certaine huge Lakes, such as were capable of the Roman fleet. The same authour nameth certaine <HI>Frisios Transrhenanos,</HI> Frieslandmen, dwelling beyond the <HI>Rhein:</HI> which he saith did rather mislike the auarice of the Romanes then their command. <HI>Iulius Capitolinus</HI> in the life of <HI>Clo∣dius Albinus</HI> the Emperour, saith, that these Transrhenane Frieslanders were by the same <HI>Clodius Albinus</HI> discomfi∣ted and ouerthrowne. <HI>Pliny</HI> mentioneth certaine Ilands of the Frieslanders <HI>(insulas Frisiorum)</HI> in the riuer of <HI>Rhein:</HI> and the <HI>Erisciabones,</HI> a kind of people between <HI>Helium</HI> and <HI>Fleuum,</HI> two mouthes of the <HI>Rhein,</HI> where it emptieth it selfe into the maine sea.</P>
<P>It is manifest therefore that the <HI>Frisij,</HI> anciently did not passe the riuer <HI>Eems:</HI> but at this day they are further spred Eastward, almost as farre as the riuer <HI>Weser,</HI> (the old Geographers called it <HI>Visurgis.</HI>) Who also otherwise of them sometime, were designed by the name of the <HI>Chauci;</HI> (or <HI>Cauchi,</HI> for diuers authours write it diuersly) it is out of all doubt. And beside these vp higher, euen in <HI>Denmarke,</HI> in the confines of the little prouince <HI>Dietmarsh,</HI> there dwell a people vulgarly knowne by the name of <HI>Strandt Vriesen,</HI> that is, Frieslandmen inhabiting vpon the sea coast. These it may be were those which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth <HI>Sigulones. Saxo Grammaticus,</HI> and <HI>Albertus Crantzius,</HI> calleth this <HI>Frisiam Eydorensem,</HI> (of the riuer <HI>Eider</HI> vpon which it bordereth) and <HI>Frisiam Minorem,</HI> the Lesser <HI>Friesland,</HI> both of them ma∣king it a branch sprung from those ancient <HI>Frisij. Cornelius Kempius</HI> in his description of <HI>Friesland,</HI> diuideth the whole country into seuen <HI>Zelands,</HI> that is, marine shires, you may terme them. The first is vpon the West of the riuer <HI>Fleuus</HI> or <HI>Isel,</HI> and now is called <HI>Waterlandt:</HI> Then <HI>Westergoe,</HI> as who would say, The West-land: The third <HI>Oestergoe,</HI> that is, The East-land. These three he saith are commonly known and conteined vnder the name of WEST FRIESLAND. The fourth is about the riuer <HI>Isel,</HI> where the cities <HI>Dauenter, Swool, Hasselt, Steenwijck</HI> and <HI>Wollenhoue</HI> are seated. The fifth conteineth the liberties of <HI>Groeningen:</HI> The sixt that part which they call East-<HI>Friesland.</HI> The seuenth is from the riuer <HI>Weser,</HI> beyond <HI>Elbe,</HI> euen vnto the little riuer <HI>Eyder.</HI> Otherwise this country of the <HI>Frisij,</HI> is vulgarly diuided into three parts, East <HI>Friesland,</HI> West <HI>Friesland,</HI> and Middle <HI>Friesland,</HI> which of some is called <HI>Groningen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ptolemey</HI> nameth three towns of the <HI>Frisij, Manarmanis, Phleum,</HI> and <HI>Siatutanda: Fleum Castellum</HI> in <HI>Tacitus</HI> is the same as I thinke that <HI>Phleum</HI> is in <HI>Ptolemey:</HI> the same <HI>Tacitus</HI> also maketh mention of <HI>Cruptoricis stipendarij villa</HI> the Mannor of <HI>Cruptorix</HI> the stipendary: Item, the groue of <HI>Baduhenna,</HI> where he greatly lamenteth that 900. Romans had their throats cut, and where another supplie of 400. men, after that they had a suspicion of treason, did one kill another. The same authour writeth that in his time <HI>Hercules</HI> pillars were heere still remaining. <HI>The braue couragious minde of this nation and high conceit of their owne valour, is manifest by the history of</HI> Verritus <HI>and</HI> Malorix, <HI>two of their princes. For these (as</HI> Tacitus <HI>reporteth) going to</HI> Rome, <HI>and finding</HI> Nero <HI>the Emperour busied about other matters, amongst o∣ther things which were vsually shewed to barbarous people, they came into</HI> Pompeys <HI>theatre, that they might behold the greatnesse of it. While they sate idly there vpon the scaffolds (for they were not caried away altogether with the sight of the pastimes, as if they neuer had seen such before) they question about the differences of estates, what or who was a knight, and where sate the Senatours, they obserued some to sit in the Senatours rooms in a strange habit: and demanding who they were, after they heard, that that honour was giuen to the Embassadours of those nations which for valour, and amity with the Ro∣mans did excell others, they cried out with a loud voice,</HI> THERE ARE NO PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, THAT FOR PROVVES AND FIDELITY DO GO BEFORE THE GERMANES: <HI>and thereupon they left their places &amp; placed them∣selues in the Senatours roome: and it was well taken of the beholders, as a token of their ancient spirit and earnest emulation of vertue.</HI> Nero <HI>made them both freemen of the city of</HI> Rome.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> writeth in the third chapter of the fifth booke of his naturall historie, that amongst the Frieslanders there grow∣eth an hearb which they call <HI>Britannica,</HI> hauing long blacke leaues; and a blacke roote. The iuice of this herb is pressed also out of the roote. The flowres by a proper name they call <HI>Vibones:</HI> which being gathered before any thunder is heard, and eaten, do wholly preserue a man from that danger. This herb is not only good and medicinable for the sinews, and diseases of the mouth, but also against the Golne or Squinancy and biting of Serpents. Whether this herb be at this day certainly knowne, and by what name, I desire to be informed of our learned Herbatists.</P>
<P>Whether that the inhabitants of this prouince be those same <HI>Frisij,</HI> or whether happily they tooke their beginning and name from the Phrygians of <HI>Asia,</HI> as some would haue it, or from others of other places, (for <HI>Strabo</HI> acknowled∣geth also certaine <HI>Phrygi</HI> in <HI>Illyria,</HI> about the <HI>Ceraunian</HI> hilles) I leaue to the learned to determine. The idle fables of those men I cannot chose but laugh at, which do thinke that these <HI>Frisij</HI> came into this country from <HI>Fresia,</HI> a prouince of <HI>India.</HI> If I were delighted with fables, I had rather with <HI>Hanibald</HI> fetch the name of this people from their king <HI>Fri∣sus,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Clodio.</HI> The writers of middle age, especially the French, do call them, as I haue obserued, <HI>Frisones,</HI> by a name framed of the French word <HI>Frisons,</HI> by which the Frenchmen at this day vulgarly do call the people of this prouince. They retaine euen to this day the ancient name. For they are commonly, amongst themselues in their own language, called <HI>Friesen,</HI> by which name also they are known throughout all <HI>Germanie.</HI></P>
<P>They were conuerted vnto Christianitie by S. <HI>Boniface</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> at that same time when <HI>Zacharie</HI> was Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI> There is a strange historie of <HI>Rabod</HI> Duke of <HI>Friesland,</HI> who when he should by Baptisme haue beene consecrated and adopted into the number of Christs flocke, he demanded to what place his Grandfathers and Great∣grandfathers were gone before him: and when he vnderstood that they were all gone to Hell, he returned backe again saying, that he had rather be with his ancestors. Whether of this <HI>Rabod</HI> our word <HI>Rahoudt,</HI> whereby in our Mother tongue we signifie a knaue and a wicked fellow, were deriued, I cannot tell. <HI>Suffridus Petrus Frisius</HI> hath written ge∣nerally of the <HI>Frisij,</HI> in a seuerall and peculiar treatise dedicated wholly to this argument: <HI>Cornelius Kempius</HI> and o∣thers haue done the like: But <HI>Vbbo Emmius Frisius Gretensis</HI> of all hath done the same most learnedly.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Riesland</HI> at this day is by the riuer <HI>Eems</HI> diuided into West-<HI>Friesland</HI> and East-<HI>Friesland.</HI> West <HI>Friesland,</HI> whose description we heere do offer vnto thy view, doth by a most ancient right chalenge vnto it selfe the name of <HI>Friesland,</HI> and was alwaies esteemed the better. For this country had his proper king, vn∣till the daies of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great: after whose death this prouince was di∣uersly vexed and suffered many greeuous storms of frowning fortunes ire, although indeed before that time also it had often been assaulted and batte∣red by the Danes and Norweies. Yea and the raging Ocean, a continuall and most noisome enemie of this countrie, by ouerflowing, beating vpon it, tearing and rending his walls and banks hath much molested the same, and yet it will not suffer it to be quiet. Lastly, how it hath of later daies been troubled by the Bishops of <HI>Vtrecht</HI> and Earles of <HI>Holland,</HI> I thinke there is no man but doth well remember. But at length, in the daies of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, a very peaceable prince, it enioied peace and rest from all former troubles. At this day they do diuide it into three parts; <HI>Westergoe, Oestergoe,</HI> and <HI>Seuenwolden:</HI> which againe are distinguished into 29. <HI>Gre∣tanies,</HI> (as they vulgarly call them in their mother tongue) Courts or principall places appointed for the executing of iustice. Moreouer in this mappe there is described the territory of the renow∣med city <HI>Groningen:</HI> as also that tract which they call <HI>Ommeland:</HI> to these are adioined <HI>Ouerysel, Drent,</HI> and <HI>Twent,</HI> countries of a fatte and fertile glebe, well inhabited, full of villages and hamlets, bree∣ding also great plenty of cattell.</P>
<P>The cities of West <HI>Friesland</HI> are thirteen, GROENINGEN, the more famous for that it brought forth the learned <HI>Rodolphus Agricola:</HI> DAM, LIEVVERDT with a faire castle: heere is kept the Court or place of Parliament and Chancerie, as they commonly call it: DOCKVM, the place where the famous Mathematician <HI>Gemma Frisius</HI> was borne: FRANICHER, a common palace, and place of retreit whither the Noblemen and Gentry of this country do for their pleasure retire themselues: BOLSART, SNEECK, where <HI>Ioachim Hopper</HI> a very learned and worthy man, was borne: ILST, SLOTEN, HARLINGEN, vpon an arme of the German ocean; (which they call <HI>Suyderzee,</HI>) hath a commodious hauen; garded with a strong castle to defend it from the impechment and assault of the enemie: WORCKVM and HINDELOPEN, vpon the same bay: Lastly, STAVEREN, which in time past hath been a mighty city, but now hauing endured many bitter storms and in∣undations of the sea, it is nothing so renowmed nor great. There are beside these 490. villages or parishes, of which diuers are endowed with great priuiledges, and haue many rich farmours: It hath many Monasteries; so that for the beauty of their townes, husbandrie of the land, and stately Abbeies, <HI>Friesland</HI> giueth place to no other country whatsoeuer. That in this prouince are many gentlemen descended from honourable families, hauing their houses and farms in diuers places of the shire, and no Barons or free Lords, the cause is partly by reason of the foresaid casualities, and partly for that they being contented with their own estate and liberty, haue not followed the courts of forrein Princes.</P>
<P><HI>Petrus Oliuarus</HI> in his annotations vpon <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> where he speaketh of West <HI>Friesland,</HI> wri∣teth, that within so little a circuite of ground he neuer saw so many parish Churches. There were, saith he, which do alleadge this to haue been the cause of that multitude of Churches: they report that there arose a great contention amongst the nobility of this country about their places in those Churches, euery one contending for the highest seat: and when as this contention grew euery day worse and worse, they determined, as many as were able, to build them seuerall Curches, eue∣ry man vpon his owne demaines: and so euery man might take the highest roome in his own seat: and heere grew the cause of building so many Churches. Thus farre <HI>Oliuarius,</HI> where also thou maist see many things els worth the reading. Moreouer read <HI>Albertus Crantzius,</HI> his <HI>Saxonia.</HI> But he that desireth a more ample knowledge of this prouince, let him haue recourse vnto the description of the Low countries done by <HI>Lewis Guicciardine. Aelsius Edouardus Leon Frisius</HI> hath described this country in Heroike verse, dedicated to D. <HI>Viglius Zwichemus: Cornelius Kempius,</HI> and <HI>Suffridus Petrus</HI> haue done the same at large in peculiar treatises. The learned <HI>Hieronymus Verrutius</HI> did this other day promise to set out the antiquities of this Country.</P>

<HEAD>EAST FRIESLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat the <HI>Frisij,</HI> did not in former times inhabit this tract, but the <HI>Cauchi,</HI> there is none, I thinke, that doubt. Beside <HI>Strabo, Dion, Suetonius, Paterculus,</HI> and <HI>Ael. Spartianus, Ptolemey,</HI> (who di∣stinguisheth them into <HI>The Greater,</HI> and <HI>The Lesser,</HI>) doth make mention of this people. <HI>Ptolemey</HI> placeth the <HI>Greater Cauchi,</HI> between the riuers <HI>Weiser</HI> and <HI>Elbe:</HI> the Lesser, between <HI>Eems</HI> and <HI>Weiser,</HI> where now these Frieslanders, which we call <HI>East-Frieslanders,</HI> at this day do dwell. Of the <HI>Cauchi, Pliny</HI> in the first Chapter of his sixteenth booke, thus speaketh: <HI>In the North we haue seene, saith he, the countries of the</HI> Cauchi, <HI>the Greater and the Lesser, (as they are termed) altoge∣ther void of wood and trees. For by an huge in-let there, twise euery day and night by courses, the sea runneth in amaine, confusedly couering whatsoeuer generally the earth bringeth forth; leauing it doubtfull which is sea, and which is land. There the silly distressed people get them vp to the toppes of high hills, or mounts raised, by labour and industrie of men, (according to the height of the highest tide, as they find by experi∣ence,) and thereon they build their poore cottages: where they dwell like sailers floting on the waters, when the ocean flowing en∣closeth them round: or like those which haue suffered shipwrake, when the waters ebbing returne backe againe: and then they go out to fish about their cabbines, when they obserue the fish to follow the tide. They haue no cattell, they liue not vpon milke and whit-meats as their neighbours do, they hunt not any wild beast, as being farre from any shrubs or bushes where they may hide their heads. Of Reike, a kind of seaweed, and rushes growing vpon the washes and boggy places they twist cords, whereof they make their fishing nets: and taking vp a kind of muddy earth with their hands, drying it rather with the wind, then with the sunne, they vse it for fuell to dresse their meat, and heat their limmes, starke and stiffe with the cold blasts of the Northren winds. They haue no other drinke but raine water, which they catch and keep in ditches in the porches of their houses. Yet these nations, if they be at this day conquered by the Romanes, they count it no other but slauery and bondage. So it is indeed, fortune is fauourable to some to their owne hurt and hinderance.</HI> Thus <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth of this people; who wondereth that they preferred liberty, be∣fore the tyrannous command of the Romanes, or rather, as I thinke, he enuieth that they were freed from their yoke. For neither is it yet so wonderfull a thing as he would make it, for a free nation, before all things els whatsoeuer, to maintaine their liberty: which is excellent a thing in his iudgement, ô <HI>Pliny,</HI> whom thou thy selfe doest highly commend before all other, who perswadeth vs to maintaine the same with the vttermost hazard of our life: and affirmeth it worthily to be desired and preferred not only of man, but also of brute beasts, before all things in the world beside.</P>
<P>This country in former times was diuided into many Signiories; which seuerally were gouerned by their seuerall and proper Princes, euen vnto the time of <HI>Fredericke</HI> the third, Emperour of <HI>Rome;</HI> who gaue this whole country vnto one <HI>Vl∣ricke,</HI> and created him Earle of the same, in the yeare after Christs natiuity 1465.</P>
<P>The soile of this tract is so rich of all necessarie things, that it seemeth not greatly to stand in need of the help of neighbour countries. Yea it doth so plentifully abound with diuers things, as Horses, Oxen, Cattell, Hogges, Wool, Butter, Cheese, Barley, Oates, Wheat, Beanes, Pease, and Salt, that from hence euery yeare they conuey great store of these com∣modities vnto forrein countries. This County hath but two walled cities, namely, <HI>Eemden</HI> and <HI>Awricke.</HI> Of which EEM∣DEN, situate at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Eems,</HI> is the common Mart-towne of the whole prouince, for concourse of Merchants especially famous, which indeed is caused by the commodiousnesse and opportunity of the hauen, which doth thrust it selfe so farre vp into the heart of the city, at such a great height and depth, that it doth easily receiue and entertaine great shippes, full laden, with sailes stricken into the very middest of the same. This city is much beautified with the sumptuous palace of the Prince, a gorgeous Church, the Yeeld hall, and the goodly houses of the priuate citizens. AVRICK, by reason of the woods and groues which on all sides almost do inclose it, is inhabitd for the most part of Gentlemen and Noblemen, where they recreate and delight themselues with Hawking and Hunting. In the territorie of this city, there is, as <HI>Kempius</HI> reporteth, a place called <HI>Iyl,</HI> enclosed round with a wall, beset with bushes, a commodious dwelling for Hares and Deere: in which as in a Parke or warrein they maintaine a great number of these kind of beasts, which none dare take vnder a great penalty: but they are reserued for the Earles disport and pastime when he is disposed to recreate himselfe with hunting. In the confines also of this city <HI>Awricke,</HI> is a little hill rising somewhat high, (commonly they call it <HI>Obstalsboom</HI> or <HI>Vpstalsbom</HI>) where the seat of Iustice or Court leet for the whole shire is ordinarily held. Heere they were wont euery yeare, out of all the Zelands, to meet in the open and wild fields, and there by the most skilfull and approued lawiers, such as best knew their customs and lawes, to end and determine all controuersies arising between man and man. In this precinct also are diuen castles, villages and farms. Of hamlets and end-waies, such is the number, that oft times one doth touch another. The greatest part of which both for beauty of their houses and streets, as also for multitude of inhabitants and strangers, do so excell, that they may foe honour and greatnesse contend with diuers cities of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>The people do giue themselues either to traffique as Merchants, or to get their liuings by occupations and handy-crafts, or by playing the husbandmen and tilling the ground. With their neighbours and forreners they speake in the Dutch tongue, amongst themselues they vse a peculiar language, proper to that nation and not vnderstood of strangers. They are comely apparelled, yea euen the very country people, so that a man would take them to be citizens. The women weare a kind of attire and apparell much differing from that of other nations. They bind vp all the haire of their had into one locke, and that, set out with diuers siluer and gilt spangles and buttons, they let to hang behind their backe. Their head they bind vp in Summer with a caull of red coloured silke, behung with siluer spangles, but in the Winter they weare an hood of green cloth, wherewith they do so couer their whole head, that skarsely one may see their eies: this kind of attire they call an <HI>Hatte.</HI> Their vpper garment (<HI>huick</HI> of loose gowne) which they weare abroad, from the head to the foot is pleited with many small pleits, and is so stiffe with siluer and gilt wire or plate wouen into it, that when it is put off, it will stand vpright. This some∣time is made of red, sometime of green cloth. In this country of <HI>East-Friesland</HI> there are also two other counties, the one called <HI>Esens,</HI> the other <HI>Ieueren,</HI> bearing the names of their chiefe towns. Of the situation of this prouince, nature and maners of the people, read <HI>Vbbo Emmius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DENMARKE.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Axo Grammaticus</HI> hath thus described <HI>Denmarke:</HI> DENMARKE, saith he, parted in the middest by the boisterous sea, conteineth a few small parts of the maine continent, seuered and disioined one from another by the breaking in of the ocean winding and turning it selfe diuers waies. Of these IVTIA, <HI>Iuitland,</HI> is, in respect of the greatnesse and beginning, in the enterance of the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> Which as it is in situation first, so running out further, it is placed in the vtmost borders of <HI>Germany.</HI> From whose company it being parted by the intercourse of the riuer <HI>Eydor,</HI> it runneth with a larger breadth toward the North, euen to the banke of the frith of <HI>Norwey</HI> (he calleth it <HI>Fre∣tum Noricum.</HI>) In this is the bay of <HI>Lemwicke, (Sinus Lymicus)</HI> abounding with such store of fish, that it alone yeeldeth as much prouision of victuall to the inhabitants, as all the whole country be∣side. To this is adioined FRESIA, <HI>(Strand Friesen)</HI> a prouince much lesser, which lying more low then <HI>Iuitland</HI> in plaine and champion fields, receiueth from the sea ouerflowing it, great strength and heart, and is very set∣tile for come. Whose inundation or violent tide, whether it do bring to the country people more profit or dammage, it is hard to say: For in tempestuous weather the Sea breaking in through the creeks wherein the water was wont to be contained, such a world of waters oft times doth follow and come into the country, that diuers times it runneth ouer not only the fallow fields, but drowneth also whole families with their goods and cattell. After <HI>Iuitland,</HI> the ile FIONIA, <HI>(Fuinex)</HI> doth follow vpon the East, which a narrow arme of the ocean sea doth seuer from the maine land. This iland as vpon the West it looketh toward <HI>Iuitland,</HI> so vpon the East it hath the ile SEELAND, (<HI>Sialandia,</HI> he calleth it) an iland much commended for the great abun∣dance of all maner of necessary things that it yeeldeth: which for pleasant situation is thought to excell all the prouinces of this kingdome, and is supposed to be in the middest of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> indifferently situate between the one end of the same, and the other. Vpon the East side of this, an arme of the ocean runneth between it and SCONE, (<HI>Scania, Scandinauia, Basilia</HI> and <HI>Baltia</HI> called by diuers authours) a part of <HI>Norwey</HI> or <HI>Swedland.</HI> This sea yearely affoordeth great gaine to the Fishermen. For this whole bay or gulfe of the sea, is so full of all sorts of fish, that the fishermen oft times do catch such store and therewith they so fraight their boats, that they haue no roome to stirre their oares: neither do they heere vse any nets or other meanes to take the fish, but many times they are taken only with the hand. Moreouer HALLAND and BLIEKER, (<HI>Blekingia</HI> he nameth it) two prouinces, issuing forth from the maine land of <HI>Scone,</HI> like two armes from one and the same body of a tree, are, by many spaces and by-corners, adioined and knitte to <HI>Gotland</HI> and <HI>Norwey.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Saxo Grammaticus.</HI> See also <HI>Albert Crantzius, Seba∣stian Munster,</HI> and the Ecclesiasticall history of <HI>M. Adams.</HI></P>
<P>The kingdome of NORVVAY, is subiect to the crowne of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> as also the ile GOTLAND: <HI>Item,</HI> (if you will giue cre∣dit to <HI>Marke Iordane</HI> in his mappe of <HI>Denmarke</HI>) the ilands <HI>Groenland, Island, Hetland, Feroa,</HI> and the <HI>Orkneys.</HI> Yet we haue said before that the Orkney iles do belong vnto the kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> vnder the name and title of a Dukedome. <HI>Olaus</HI> also saith, but falsly as I perswade my selfe, that the ile <HI>Gotland</HI> doth belong vnto the kingdome of <HI>Swedland.</HI></P>
<P>GOTHIA, or the ile <HI>Gotland</HI> is a good ground for the feeding and bringing vp of cattell, horses and oxen. There is plentifull fishing, fowling and hunting. It is very rich of a kind of faire marble, as also of all maner of things necessary for the mainte∣nance of mans life. In it is the goodly towne <HI>Visbui,</HI> sometime the most famous and frequent Mart of all <HI>Europe.</HI> There are yet remaining certaine ruines of marble, sufficient testimony of his ancient greatnesse and beauty: at this day it is now renowmed for the faire Abbey of Benedictine Friers; and the Library there containing about 2000. bookes of sundry authours, rare and ancient manuscripts.

It is a part of the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> which <HI>M. Adams</HI> nameth <HI>Daniam Cismarinam, Denmarke</HI> on this side the sea. In the entrance of it, as one commeth out of <HI>Saxony</HI> there standeth HOLSTATIA, <HI>Holstein,</HI> which old writers, for that it is disioined and seuered four the rest of <HI>Germany,</HI> toward the North, by the riuer <HI>Elbe, (Albis</HI> they called it) named NORDALBINGIA: and for that it was alwaies accounted the vttermost Northren bound of the Roman Empire: and therefore <HI>Henry</HI> surnamed <HI>Auceps,</HI> the Fowler, Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> about 650. since, had heere in the city of <HI>Sleswicke</HI> somewhat beyond the limites of the Empire, a Lieutenant and Lord-warden of the Marches. <HI>Holstein</HI> conteineth three principall shires, WAGRIA, STORMAR, and DITMARSH: of the which <HI>Federicke</HI> the Emperour, about 106. yeares agone, made a Dukedome. The next prouince, from the riuer <HI>Eydore,</HI> which is the furthest bound of <HI>Holstein,</HI> euen vnto <HI>Kolding,</HI> conteineth the <HI>Dukedome of Sleswick,</HI> so named of <HI>Sleswick</HI> the chiefe city, and ancientest mart towne of this country. For in former times this country was intituled by the name of the <HI>Dukedome of Iuitland,</HI> which <HI>Waldemare</HI> the great-grand-child of <HI>Abel</HI> king of <HI>Denmarke</HI> first held by homaga from <HI>Erick</HI> their king, about the yeare of Christ 1280. The male line of the Kings and Dukes failing, and the Dukedome of <HI>Sleswick</HI> and the kingdome of <HI>Demnarke</HI> being vnited and knit into one body, Queen <HI>Margaret</HI> heire to the three crownes, granted the Dukedome of <HI>Sleswick</HI> to <HI>Gerard</HI> Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> on this condition; that he should acknowledge his te∣nure from the king of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> The rest of <HI>Cimbrica Chersonesus</HI> called North <HI>Iuitland,</HI> stretching it selfe toward <HI>Norway,</HI> by <HI>Scagen,</HI> (a towne by reason the quicksands and the shallow sea there, well known to sea men,) groweth sharp and narrow like a wedge. This prouince is broadest about <HI>Aleburgh,</HI> a mart towne vpon an arme of the sea, which they call <HI>Lymford:</HI> for there it falleth into <HI>Iuitland,</HI> and pearceth almost quite thorow the same Westward, diuiding <HI>Wensussel</HI> (only a very narrow space ex∣cept) from the rest, making it a <HI>Peninsula</HI> or Neckland: from thence spreading it selfe into a greater breadth, enclosing and compassing many goodly ilands, putting forth many elbowes and branches, it distinguisheth and boundeth diuers shires and countries.

<HEAD>HOLSATIA, vulgarly called HOLSTEIN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F <HI>Holstein</HI> thus <HI>Crantzius</HI> in the seuen and twentieth Chapter of his fifth booke of the history of <HI>Sa∣xony: Holstatia</HI> tooke the name of a vulgar word of thar language: for that the country is woody and full of forrests, to distinguish between these parts and the other neere adioining, which are moorish and green pasture grounds. The Saxons call the inhabitants <HI>Holsaten,</HI> that is, people dwelling a∣mongst the woods: on the contrary those which dwell in fenny countries they call <HI>Merstude.</HI> There∣of the Latines haue formed he names <HI>Holsati, Holsatia, (Holsaten</HI> and <HI>Holstein</HI>) like as the French and Italians are from their own languages wont to enrich the Latine tongue. Vpon the East, this country is bounded by the riuer <HI>Bilene,</HI> on the West by <HI>Store,</HI> on the South by <HI>Elbe</HI> or <HI>Elue;</HI> on the North by <HI>Eydore,</HI> which in time past was the furthest bound of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> From this riuer Eastward the <HI>Wandalles</HI> or <HI>Vandalles</HI> otherwise called <HI>Wagers</HI> did inhabit: of whom that prouince was named WAGRIA, of an ancient (and sometime a populous) city of that name, now a poore village little inhabited, without wall, trench, rampart or fence: the houses are couered with reeds gathered in the fennes, homely and country like: it runneth out Eastward as farre as the riuer <HI>Trauenna.</HI> Notwithstanding that part of the country, which from the riuer <HI>Bilene</HI> by <HI>Elbe</HI> decli∣neth toward the riuer <HI>Store,</HI> and of that riuer is called <HI>Stormare,</HI> leaueth but a little ground to the old <HI>Holsatia,</HI> from <HI>Store</HI> to <HI>Ey∣dore.</HI> For the Dietmarshers a people inhabiting in mournish and fenny places, do claime a freedome and priuiledge from the iu∣risdiction of any other Prince. This <HI>Crantzius</HI> in his time wrote of the state of <HI>Holstein</HI> then. Whereupon it is apparant that <HI>Holstein</HI> was diuided into <HI>Thietmarsh, Wagria,</HI> and <HI>Stormare.</HI> The same <HI>Crantzius</HI> and others, do also call these Holsaters, <HI>Tran∣sabianos</HI> and <HI>Nordalbianos,</HI> as situate beyond and vpon the North-side of the riuer <HI>Elbe,</HI> called of the Latines <HI>Albis. Ado</HI> na∣meth them also <HI>Northuidos,</HI> vnder whom are conteined, as the same authour and <HI>Helmoldus</HI> do write, the Stormaren, Holsa∣ters, and Thietmarshers.</P>
<P>He that wrote of the warres between the Danes and Dietmarshers, (his name we know not) doth describe these countries somewhat otherwise then those forenamed writers haue done. For he affirmeth that <HI>Holstein,</HI> as now it is called, generally doth comprehend the Dukedome of <HI>Sleswicke, Wagria, Stormare, Dietmarsh,</HI> and <HI>Iuitland,</HI> with certaine other lesser countries and ilands; as namely, <HI>Angle-land, Swant-land,</HI> and <HI>Wensusset</HI> anciently called <HI>Cimbrica Chersonesus.</HI> But this limitation is somewhat too large: for the same authour doth presently after write, that <HI>Holstein</HI> properly is bounded with those foure riuers, within which <HI>Crantzius</HI> doth restrein it.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hey are three Ilands perteining to <HI>Pomerland,</HI> RVGIA, <HI>Rugen,</HI> VSEDAMIA, <HI>Vsedom,</HI> and WOLLINIA, <HI>Wool∣lin,</HI> the more famous for their three Market townes, <HI>Vineta, Arcona</HI> and <HI>Iulina.</HI> VINETA, a goodly towne of <HI>Vsedome,</HI> which <HI>Conrad</HI> the second Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> surnamed <HI>Salignus,</HI> by the helpe of <HI>Canutus</HI> king of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> destroied in the yeare of Christ, 1036. hauing stood in flourishing estate about 250. yeares toge∣ther: the quarrell grew, as they report, for that they had vsed certaine Christian Merchants trading thither, very despightfully and cruelly. It was not situate, as <HI>Crantzius</HI> affirmeth, neere the mouth of the riuer <HI>Diuenow,</HI> or vpon the East side of the creeke, where the new lake emptieth it selfe into the sea. For it is from thence seuen miles West∣ward, two miles Southward from the strong castell <HI>Wolgast.</HI> At this day the foundation of it is yet to be seene in the sea, about thirty furlongs from the shore, or from the fisher-mens cottages in <HI>Damerow.</HI> It seemeth to haue beene welnigh as bigge as <HI>Lubecke.</HI> Toward the latter end of winter, the ice of the marine quarters there about are gathered together and do stay vpon these breaches, and oft times it appeareth a farre off like a Castell or Bulwarke. Heere the Seales <HI>(Phocae)</HI> do cast their yong and bring them vp in the sommer time, (the East sea being calme,) vpon the cragges and rocks there. And been they sleepe vpon the toppes of the cliffes and rocks which am aboue the waters. These do much hurt to the poore fisher-men that dwell heere about; eating vp the laxes and other fishes, which they catch with hookes.</P>
<P>ARCONA, now the sea-men vulgarly call it <HI>Ormunde.</HI> In the neckeland of <HI>Rugen,</HI> was <HI>Wittow</HI> or <HI>Witmund,</HI> as the Hollan∣ders call it, of the high white chalkie cliffes vpon the sea-coast. This iland is diuided into many small iles and neck-lands: It hath in all 28. parish Churches. <HI>Waldemare</HI> king of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> in the yeare of Christ, 1168. spoiled <HI>Arcona. Ottocare</HI> king of the Romanes and of all <HI>Italie,</HI> was borne in <HI>Rugen,</HI> as also diuers other famous captaines, renowmed in histories, and registred by <HI>Francis Ireney.</HI> In our time it hath brought forth many learned noble men, which haue beene of the Councell to Kings and great Princes.</P>
<P>IVLINVM, now <HI>Wollin,</HI> stood longest. This ouercame the fleet royall and great armado of <HI>Swein</HI> the first, king of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and tooke him thrise in three seuerall battels at sea; yet was three times rescued and released our of their hands againe. <HI>Iulinum</HI> stood in that place or there about where now the towne <HI>Wollin</HI> is seated, as the monuments in the places neere adioining do sufficiently testifie. Saint <HI>Otto</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bamberg,</HI> the Apostle of <HI>Pomerland,</HI> in the yeare 1124. in this towne baptized 22000. men. Heere the Prince of <HI>Pomerland</HI> erected a Bishops sea, and <HI>Albertus</HI> the first Bishop of <HI>Pomerland,</HI> was first installed Bishop of the same. Yet the citizens and people about <HI>Iulinum</HI> did soone fall backe to paganisme and do againe adore their idoll <HI>Trigilaff,</HI> and vtterly forsooke Christ: and therefore fire fell downe from heauen, and wasted the city. <HI>Waldemare</HI> also pre∣sently after the fire, two yeares, after the ouerthrow of <HI>Arcona,</HI> rased <HI>Iulinum</HI> to the ground.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F the MARSI, descended from <HI>Marsus, Strabo</HI> the ancient Geographer speaketh: and saith that many yeares since they went from the coasts about the <HI>Rhein,</HI> into a low and moorish country. Of these are come the THEVTOMARSI, or, as they commonlie pronounce the word, the <HI>Thietmarsi,</HI> (the Dietmarshers) who about 400. yeares agone, were gouerned by the most ancient family of <HI>Staden,</HI> many of which they treacherously slew, and so at length they made themselues free, by killing &amp; banishing all their Nobility. <HI>Henry,</HI> surnamed the <HI>Lion,</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> subdued them: but he being out-lawed by the Emperour <HI>Fredericke, Walemare</HI> king of <HI>Denmarke</HI> seized vpon the country, and when as he vsed their helpe against <HI>Adolph</HI> Earle of <HI>Holstein</HI> and the Lubeckers, they reuolted vnto the enemies, by whom the king was ouercome at the village <HI>Bornhouet.</HI> Thus againe being restored vnto their liberty, least they might seeme to be <HI>Anarchi,</HI> subiect to no Iurisdiction, they shrowded themselues vnder the patronage of the Arch∣hishop of <HI>Breme,</HI> and him they acknowledged for their Prince: but yet they would neuer pay him tribute or sub∣sidie, nor euer would be obedient to his lawes or commands. Often the Dukes of <HI>Holstein</HI> haue attempted wars against them, and alwaies they suffered the repulse. <HI>Fredericke</HI> the third, Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> gaue the country to <HI>Christian</HI> the first, king of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> vnder the title of a Dukedome: whose sonne <HI>Iohn,</HI> making war vpon them in the yeare 1500. lost the day, all his forces being ouerthrowen, himselfe with a very few hardly escaped by flight, leauing behind him the greatest part of the nobility of <HI>Holstein.</HI> After that, they grew more insolent by this victory, and oft greatly troubled and molested the Duke of <HI>Holstein. Adolph</HI> sonne of <HI>Fredericke</HI> king of <HI>Den∣marke,</HI> heire to the kingdome of <HI>Norway,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Sleswicke</HI> and <HI>Holstein,</HI> not being able to endure their male-part insolencie, in the yeare of Christ 1559. mustereth his men, gathereth a great army, to whom <HI>Fredericke</HI> the second, king of <HI>Demnarke,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> his brother, ioine their forces. These armies thus vnited, set forward, and presently take <HI>Meldorp,</HI> with all the South part of the prouince. Then after a few daies respite, they ledde their forces along by <HI>Tilenbrugge,:</HI> against whom the Dietmarshers out of <HI>Hemmingstade</HI> make head with all their pow∣er, and met the enemy before the towne <HI>Heyde;</HI> entending to force the souldiers to retire being wearied with a tedious march: but oft repelled, and yet charging againe afresh, at length they are beaten downe, killed, forced to flie, and the towne is taken and fired. There were slaine that day about 3000. Dietmarshers. Duke <HI>Adolph</HI> labouring like a valiant captaine, to keep his men in aray, and to bring them on againe which began to flie, re∣ceiued an hurt. This battell was fought vpon the thirteenth day of Iune. The Dietmarshers hauing receiued this ouerthrow, submitted themselues to the King and the Dukes, and obteining pardon, they were againe re∣ceiued to grace: and thus <HI>Dietmarsh,</HI> which for many ages together by force of armes had defended and main∣tained their liberty, became subiect to the Dukes of <HI>Holstein.</HI> This the authour of this Mappe, which heere we haue inserted into our Theater, hath written of this country. See also <HI>Albert Crantzius</HI> his Chronicle of <HI>Saxony.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lthough this Mappe do beare the title of <HI>Saxony,</HI> notwithstanding it conteineth not all <HI>Saxony:</HI> for the true and ancient <HI>Saxony</HI> was comprehended in former times between the riuers <HI>Elue</HI> and <HI>Rhein,</HI> according to his vttermost length: the breadth of it was restrained by the Germane sea, and the riuer <HI>Eydore,</HI> and the borders of <HI>Hessen</HI> and <HI>Thuringen. Brunswicke</HI> was almost in the center and middest of it. But now it is not bounded with those or such like naturall bounds, such as riuers and mountaines are; but it is confined by other Princes signiories and countries. Therefore <HI>Saxony</HI> at this day is diuided into the Vpper and Neather. The Vpper or High <HI>Saxony</HI> is that which this Mappe doth represent, and is graced with the title of a Dukedome: whose Duke also is one of the Princes Electours, which haue their voices in the choosing of the Empe∣rour. The chiefe townes of this prouince are <HI>VVitteberg</HI> and <HI>Torga.</HI> Of <HI>Saxony</HI> and the antiquities of the same, <HI>Albert Crantz</HI> hath written a whole volume. M. <HI>Adams</HI> also in the first booke of his Ecclesiasticall history, hath some things of this country worth the reading. <HI>Hamelman</HI> hath set out the histories of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>VVestfalen.</HI> They that do desire to know the situation, buttes and bounds, and famous acts, let them read <HI>VVitichinde</HI> and <HI>Sebastian Munster. Pet. Albinus Niuemontius</HI> very lately, and <HI>Dauid Chytraeus,</HI> haue written very learnedly of this prouince.</P>
<P>Of the Marquesate of BRANDENBVRG, LVSATIA, <HI>(Laussnitz)</HI> and VOITLAND, countries which we haue also described in this Chart, take these few lines; The Marquesate of BRANDENBVRG, one of those prouinces which in old time were inhabited of the <HI>Wandalls,</HI> is diuided at this day into the Old and the New; by this runneth the riuer <HI>Oder,</HI> by that <HI>Elue, Albis</HI> the Latines call it. In the old Mar∣quesate the chiefe city is <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> whereof the whole country tooke his name. The New hath the city <HI>Franckford:</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Franckford</HI> vpon <HI>Oder,</HI> to make a difference between it and that which is situate vpon the riuer <HI>Meyn.</HI> Heere is an Vniuersitie, and a great Mart kept twise euery yeare. At <HI>Berline;</HI> is the Princes court ordinarily kept. Him, of the Marquesate they commonly call the <HI>Marquesse:</HI> he also is one of the Prince Electours.</P>
<P>VOITLAND is a little shire subiect to the Marquesse. This <HI>Aeneas Syluius</HI> calleth <HI>Aduocatorum terram,</HI> and <HI>Praetorianam,</HI> the Sollicitours or Controwlers land, framing a word from the Etymologie or true meaning of the Germaine name; for <HI>Voyt,</HI> in the Dutch tongue signifieth a Sollicitour or Controwler. So called for that sometime the Prince of this country was one of the foure controwlers of the Roman Empire. The townes of better note are these, as <HI>Gasper Bruschius</HI> thus reckoneth them vp in Munsters Cosmographie: <HI>Curia Regnitiana, Renitz</HI> court, commonly called <HI>Hoff,</HI> (so named of the riuers which runne by it and there falling into <HI>Sala,</HI>) a great city and very populous, beautified with the goodly and stately Church of S. <HI>Michael,</HI> a large Monastery of Nunnes, and two rich Hospitalls. <HI>Plauhenium,</HI> or <HI>Plaun;</HI> a city with a castell. <HI>Olsnitz,</HI> which the castell <HI>Voytzberg,</HI> neere adioining. <HI>Adorff,</HI> and <HI>Weidonium, (Weyda</HI> as I thinke) a faire towne, with certaine Abbeies about them, <HI>Milford</HI> and <HI>VVhite-crowne, Geraw Scletz,</HI> and whatsoeuer is between the <HI>Hoff</HI> and <HI>Cygney,</HI> standing vpon the riuer <HI>Elster, (Hallestra,</HI> the Latines call it.) Neere vnto this is <HI>Feichtelberg,</HI> that famous mountaine bearing plentifully the stately Pine-trees, out of which foure riuers do arise &amp; runne, (a very strange worke of Nature) vnto foure quarters of the world: namely, <HI>Egre, Meyn, Nabe,</HI> and <HI>Sala. VVolfangus Iobstius</HI> hath written a curious description of the Marque∣sate of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI></P>
<P>LVSATIA, <HI>Laussnitz,</HI> is diuided into <HI>Ober Laussnitz,</HI> and <HI>Nider Laussnitz,</HI> the Vpper, and the Neather: it is also is a part of <HI>Saxony,</HI> as <HI>Rithaymer</HI> testifieth. It lieth between the riuers <HI>Elue</HI> and <HI>Oder,</HI> and the Bohe∣mian mountaines. Sometime it was a part of <HI>Meisen, (Misnia,)</HI> and was adioined to it: but the Bohemi∣ans; who laboured by all meanes to enlarge the bounds of their kingdome and command, at length seized it into their hands. The people in maners, conditions and language do not much differ from the Silesians: only they are distinct from them by name, and iurisdiction, as gouerned by seuerall Princes. The name and appellation of <HI>Lusatia,</HI> is somewhat neere in sound to the name of <HI>Elysij,</HI> or <HI>Lygij,</HI> which it is certaine, as <HI>Ioachinus Cureus</HI> writeth, sometime dwelt heere about. Their chiefe cities are <HI>Gorlitz,</HI> and <HI>Sittaw,</HI> and some others. The riuer <HI>Neiss</HI> runneth through the middest of this country. <HI>Gasper Peucer,</HI> hath this other day in Elegiacke verse, described the same in a pecular treatise. MISNIA, <HI>(Meisen)</HI> and THVRINGIA, <HI>(Thuringen)</HI> are described and set out in their seuerall tables, which we haue heereafter inserted into this our Theater of the World in their proper places. A portraiture and draught of these countries, shaddowed and counterfeited out of the Geographicall Chart of <HI>Iohn Criginger,</HI> which was imprinted at <HI>Prage</HI> in <HI>Bohemia</HI> in the yeare of Christ 1568. we haue adioined to this our worke.</P>

But if there be any man that shall thinke and obiect, that this storie of the Round Table is too fabulous to confirme this our assertion, yet this is certaine and cannot be doubted of, that in England, almost in the middest of the kingdome, there is a towne called Mansfield, situate betweeene the riuers of Trent and Rotheram, not farre from the city of Nottingham.</P>
<P>This county containeth also foure other counties: namely, ARNSTEDT, WIPRA, WETHIN and QVERNFVRT, all which in former times had their proper and peculiar Earles, but now at this day beside the counte Mansfield they haue not any one. In this county also there is the county Palatine of Saxony. Moreouer there are beside these certaine other Lordships and Principalities, as thou maist see in the Mappe. The chiefe and principall cities are MANSFIELD, EYSLEBEN, WIPRA and LEIMBACH.</P>
<P>This country is very full of Mettall-mines. Heere out of the earth are digged those sleitstones, which they call <HI>Scheyffersteyn,</HI> such as scarcely are to be found, as Sebastian Munster writeth, in any other place of the world beside. It hath also certaine stones laden with Copper, which being burnt in the fire and then steeped and washed in water do yeeld the mettall, and together with it some good store of Siluer. But this is a wonderfull strange pranke, that Nature heere in sporting maner vsually plaieth, which the same authour there speaketh of well worth the obseruation: namely of a great Lake in this country well stored with diuers and sundry sorts of fish: all which kinds of fish, together with the paddockes, frogs, newts, and such other things liuing in this lake, are found so curiously expressed &amp; shaped out in stones, as we haue to our great admiration beheld, as it is a very hard matter at the first sight vpon the sudden to discern them from the naturall liuing creatures of that kind, and that so liuelily that thou shalt be able presently to distinguish one from another and to call them by their seuerall and proper names. Some of these I haue, giuen me by Peter Ernest, the most renowmed and illustrious Earle of this country, and worthy Gouernour of the prouince of Lutzenburg.</P>
<P>There is a Lake in this country, which, by reason of the saltnesse of the water, they call <HI>Gesaltzen,</HI> in∣to which, if the fishermen shall cast in their nets ouer deepe, they will presently be sienged &amp; schorched euen as if they had beene burnt or drawne through the fire, as Seuerinus Gobelinus, in his history of Amber, reporteth. The same authour writeth that neere vnto Eisleben, there was not long since a piece of Amber found as bigge as a mans head.</P>
<P>Syriacus Spangeberg did promise to set out the history of this countrey, wherin all the cities, castles, villages, mountaines, woods, riuers, lakes, mines &amp;c. should seuerally be described; together with the Antiquities, Records, Petigrees, and such other historicall matters of the same.</P>

<HEAD>The Principality of HENNENBERG.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He terrirory and precinct of the Princes of HENNENBERG, a part of East France, how large and wide it was, you may see by this our Chorographicall Mappe; the buts and bounds of it are thus: Vpon the West and North it hath Thuringen, and the great forest, which of this countrie is called <HI>Durynger Waldt;</HI> (whose head on these parts doth diuide Thuringen from Frankenland) on the South it is confined with the riuer of Meyn, and the bishoprickes of Bamberg and Wuitzburg. Moreouer the East part is enclosed with that great mountaine which the country people do call, <HI>Die Rhon,</HI> or <HI>Rosn:</HI> vpon the same side also it hath the Diocesse of Fulden, and the prouince of Hessen. This country is wonderfully stored with deere, wild fowle, fish and such other things necessary for the maintenance of mans life. It hath also some Mines of mettals, especially of iron, whereof great store is yearely from hence, to the great gaine and commodity of the inhabitants, transported into forren countries. It is watered heere and there with many and diuers fountaines, heads, or springs of the riuer <HI>Visurgis,</HI> which in these parts they call <HI>Die Werra,</HI> but mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e properly, it is of some in other places called <HI>Die Wesser,</HI> which indeed the name of the Abbey <HI>Vesser</HI> doth seeme to approoue for truth: which Francis Irenicus and Wolfgangus Lazius do verily beleeue to haue beene so denominated of <HI>Wasser,</HI> which in the Ger∣mane is as much to say, as <HI>water,</HI> in the English.</P>
<P>Of the first beginning and originall of this house or family of Hennenberg, by reason of the negligence of the writers and Historians of those times, we can determine nothing for certainty, beside this, that in the time of Attila and Charles the Great, some authours do make mention of the Princes of Hennenberg, which also were Earles of Frankland and Burggraues of Wurtzeburg. So againe in the time of Henry the first, Empe∣rour of Germany, Gottwald and Otto of this house of Hennenberg, serued valiantly in defence of the Empire against the assaults and inrodes of the <HI>Vgri.</HI> Item the <HI>Boppones,</HI> two learned men of this family, in the yeares of Christ 941. and 961. were bishops of Wurtzeburg, and gouerned that sea with the great applause and praise of all men. But the true pedigree of these Princes is deriued from BOPPO, who in the yeare of our Lord 1078. following Henry the fourth, the Emperours side, in the battell fought betweene him and Rudolph the Switzer, neere to the city Mel∣richstadt, valiantly fighting was honourablie slaine in the field. After him succeeded his sonne GOTTEBALD, first founder of the Abbey of Vesser, for the Monkes of the order of the brotherhood of the Praemonstratenses: After him followed his sonne BERTHOLD; then BOPPO the Second, next him BOPPO the Third, all which succeeded one after another in a right line. This Boppo the Third had by his second wife <HI>Iut∣ta,</HI> of Thuringen, HERMAN, whose sonne BOPPO the Fourth died, leauing no issue behind him: But by his first wife <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of the familie of the Princes of Saxony, he had HENRY, who had issue HENRY the Second, HERMAN the Second, and BERTHOLD the Second: Hen∣ry had issue BOPPO the Fift; whose sonne BERTHOLD the Third died without issue. But after Herman these Princes, HENRY the Second, HERMAN the Third, FREDERICK the First, GEORGE the First, and lastly FREDERICK the Second lineally descended one from ano∣ther, successiuely gouerned this prouince. This Fredericke had issue HERMAN, who by his wife <HI>Margaret,</HI> of the family of Brandenburg had two sonnes, BERTHOLD the Fourth, and ALBERT, both which died in the yeare of our Lord God, 1549. and left no issue behind them. Then of the line of Berthold the Second, third sonne of Henry the First, succeeded BERTHOLD the Fift, who for his singular virtues, wisedome, expe∣rience, and excellent gifts other waies, was in the yeare after Christs incarnation, 1310. by Henry of Lutzelburg the Emperour, with the generall consent of the whole company of the Electours, installed one of the Princes of the Empire. And after that, for the same his virtues, and for that he was in managing all maner of businesses a most prudent, faithfull and fortunate man, by Lewis the Fourth, the next successour in the Empire, much set by and greatly esteemed. In his time, this whole prouince as it is heere set out, in this our Chorographicall Chart, was subiect to him and to o∣ther Princes and Earles of Hennenberg then liuing. But HENRY his sonne dying without issue male, the greatest part of this countrey, by the marriage of his three daughters, KATHARINE, SOPHIA, and ELIZABETH, fell vnto the Marquesses of Misnia, Burggraues of Noriberg, and Princes of Wurtenburg, which two last selling their portions, the bishop of Wurtenburg did much enlarge his diocesse. IOHN, the second sonne of Berthold the first, by his wife <HI>Adelheida</HI> of the house of Hessen, had by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of the family of Luchtenburg, a sonne named HENRY the Fourth, who by <HI>Mechtilda,</HI> or Mawd, daughter to the Marquesse of Bath, WILLIAM the First, who by his wife <HI>Anna</HI> of Brunswicke, had WILLIAM the Second, which by <HI>Katharine,</HI> Countesse of Hanaw, had issue WILLIAM the Fourth, begotten of his wife <HI>Margaret</HI> daughter to the Duke of Brunswicke. This William had by his wife <HI>Anastasia,</HI> daughter of Albert, Prince Electour of Brandenburg, seuen <HI>sonnes,</HI> and six <HI>daughters,</HI> namely WILLIAM, and CASPAR, which died in their infancy: IOHN, Abbot of Fulden: WOLFGANG and CHRISTOPHER, which two died bachelours: GEORGE ERNEST and BOPPO the Sixt: This Boppo, after the death of his first wife <HI>Elizabeth</HI> daughter to the Marquesse of Brandenburg, maried <HI>Sophia,</HI> daughter to the Prince of Luneburg; he died vpon the fourth of March in the yeere of our Lord 1574. leauing no issue behind him. He was a very godly, prudent, magnanimous and curtuous Prince. That other, George Ernest, after the death of his wife <HI>Elizabeth</HI> daughter to the Duke of Brunswicke, maried <HI>Elizabeth</HI> daughter to the Prince of Wurtenburg, and at length vpon the seuen and twentieth day of December in the yeare of our Lord God 1583. yeelded to Nature and died in the seuentie and third yeare of his age, being the last Prince of that stocke or family. The description of this prouince of Hennenberg, as heere it is set downe, at this day is subiect vnto diuers Princes: the greatest part of it, belongeth to the Duke of Saxony, the rest to the bishop of Wurtenburg and the Landtgraues of Hessen. A more large and exact description of this Stocke and Family, if any man be desirous to haue, may be learned out of the Genealogy or Pedigree of M.

The length of this country, which is equall to the breadth, is about twelue Germane miles. In this narrow compasse, (as I remember not long since Hugh Brinkhorst, an Englishman, a citizen of Erford, my good friend, did tell me) there are 12. COVNTIES or Earledomes, and as many ABBEIS, which they call <HI>Gefur∣stete Abtyen</HI>) 144. CITIES, with so many MARKET TOVVNS, <HI>(Mercktflecken)</HI> 2000. PARISHES, and 150. CASTLES. It is a passing fertile country, and of wheat and such like corne it yeeldeth greater plenty than any other country of Germany whatsoeuer. Whereupon George Agricola doubted not to call it <HI>Sumen Germaniae,</HI> The Sweet-bread of Germany. Heere yearely groweth great plenty of woad (<HI>Isatis,</HI> the Latines call it) which from hence is transported into other countries, to the great gaine and commodity of the inha∣bitants: It is an herbe or weed much vsed of Diers, to set the more perfect and durable colour in wooll or wollen cloth.

<HEAD>The Dukedomes of BRVNSWIICK and LVNENBVRG.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hese two regions are at this present subiect to one Prince. They are both named of the principall cities, <HI>Brunswijck</HI> and <HI>Lunenburg.</HI> The city of <HI>Brunswijck</HI> was about the yeere 860. built by <HI>Bruno</HI> the sonne of <HI>Ludolphus,</HI> who (as <HI>Crantzius</HI> saith) first erected a street or borough, calling it <HI>Brunonis vicus,</HI> whereupon the whole citie hath euer since beene called <HI>Brunswijck.</HI> A place of great renowme, situate in the midst of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> vpon the riuer <HI>Onadri,</HI> which falles into the <HI>Weser.</HI> The beginnings of this towne were small. Howbeit in processe of time, and by degrees, it is now growen to such state, ri∣ches, and strength, as the Princes thereof are worthily called Dukes of <HI>Brunswijck.</HI> But it was very long first. For of an∣cient times they bare only the title of Lords: but vnder <HI>Frederick</HI> the Emperour, in the yeere 1235, renewing their stile, they were ordained Dukes. This is one of the seuentie Hanse-townes. From which societie, by a generall Councell of all the said townes held at <HI>Lubeck anno</HI> 1381, they were excluded, in regard of a most cruell and bloudy sedition, where∣in the greatest part of their Aldermen they slue, and the rest they banished. And so they were depriued of the benefit of the said societie for eight yeeres, vntill they had done publike penance and satisfaction. From which time they were ad∣mitted anew into the said incorporation of the Hanse: that is to say, to be partakers of all priuileges granted by Princes and gouernours of former times to all that were free of the said societie, in those foure famous marts; to wit, <HI>London</HI> in <HI>England, Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders, Bergen</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> and <HI>Nouogrod</HI> in <HI>Rus∣sia.</HI> Their tutelary saint or protectour they holde to be <HI>S. Anthor</HI> the Confessor, whilome Bishop of <HI>Triers.</HI> For the honour of whose body, because it could not be brought within their city walles, they erected a monastery vnder the title of <HI>S. Giles,</HI> then neere vnto the walles; but now (the city being in∣larged) within the same. Thus much out of <HI>Crantzius</HI> his story of <HI>Saxonie</HI> and <HI>Wandalia.</HI> The praise of this citie you may finde in <HI>Aeneas Siluius</HI> his 23. chap. of <HI>Europe.</HI> The citie of LVNEBVRG, built about the yeere of Christ 1190. vpon an hill named <HI>Calcarium,</HI> was so called, not (as the ignorant imagine) from <HI>Idolum lunae</HI> the idol of the moone, which <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> or I wot not who, did there consecrate; for this is but an old wiues tale;) but from a place not farre off by the riuer <HI>Elmenou</HI> called <HI>Luna,</HI> where there hath for many yeeres continued a cloister of Nunnes. It is a citie of great strength, en∣uironed with ditches and walles. The citizens greatest traffique is for salt: for here are most plentifull and rich salt-pits, out of which they raise exceed∣ing gaines. For salt is here boiled in great quantitie, and vented from hence both by sea and land to <HI>Hamborough, Lubeck,</HI> and other places. These salt-mines were first found in the yeere of Christ 1269. This city of <HI>Luneburg</HI> with the territory adiacent, is in a peculiar Treatise described by <HI>Lucas Lossius.</HI> Of <HI>Hildesheim</HI> fiue miles distant from <HI>Brunswijck, M. Antonie Mockerus,</HI> a citizen thereof, hath written also a peculiar discourse.</P>
<P>In this Table vpon the riuer <HI>Weser</HI> or <HI>Visurgis</HI> stands the citie of <HI>Hamelen;</HI> concerning which, the learned and famous Physitian <HI>D. Arnold Fretaghius</HI> wrote to me in a letter the story ensuing; his words be these: I chanced of late to light vpon a Saxon, and a Chronicler of <HI>Saxonie.</HI> <Q REND="inline">He reports, that 130. yeres ago the citie of <HI>Hamelen,</HI> vnder the iurisdiction of Duke <HI>Ericus,</HI> being exceedingly pestered with mice, there came a iugler that offered his seruice to the townes-men to driue them away: this offer was most acceptable vnto them, because they could keepe nothing in safetie from those mischieuous vermine. Being agreed with the townes-men, by the sound of a bell he drawes all the mice out of the citie. Then he demandeth his promised hire. They denie it him. Well, in a great rage he departs the citie, and within a yeere after returneth; and sounding the same bell which before he had vsed to con∣iure the mice, he drew after him vnto an hill not farre off, a great number of the citizens children; whither being come, both they and he immediatly va∣nished. A girle of the company, either for wearinesse, or by Gods appointment, stayeth a good distance behinde: who returning home, and being as∣ked what she saw, makes report, that her fellowes were gone vp the hill with the iugler. Then euery man runnes to seeke his childe; but in vaine: for from that time forward they could neuer know what was become of them. Hauing read this, I iudged it either to be a fable, or (as it is in very deed) a most wonderfull and strange narration. Discoursing therefore with certaine citizens of this place, I made mention heereof. They all affirmed it to be true, and sayd, that the yeere, the day, and the number of children that were lost, was registred in the records of the citie of <HI>Hamelen:</HI> and it is yet a cu∣stome among them, in their bonds and couenants which they write in an ancient hand, to vse this forme or clause of speech, <HI>Don onser kinder ausgangh,</HI> that is to say, <HI>From the departure of our children.</HI> And they say, that the way or street thorow which they were led, for the perpetuall memorie of their mis∣hap, was called by the inhabitants, <HI>Die Bungloese straess:</HI> and that it is not lawfull thereto ring a bell. If you haue perhaps read this storie heretofore, I doe now call it to your remembrance. If you know any thing that may stand me in stead, I pray you impart it as leasure and occasion shall serue. Fare you well, and loue your <HI>Fretaghius.</HI> From <HI>Groenninghen</HI> the ninth of Nouember 1580.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A description of the territory of NVRENBERG.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>Vt of <HI>Pighius</HI> his <HI>Hercules Prodicius</HI> I haue thought good to set downe the originall and description of this place: his words be these: When the barbarous <HI>Hunnes</HI> ouerran a great part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and oppressed also the people <HI>Norici</HI> inhabiting <HI>Bauaria,</HI> certaine princi∣pall families of them for shelter and refuge fled vnto the forrest <HI>Hercynia,</HI> planting themselues in a commodious place by the riuers of <HI>Pegnitz</HI> and <HI>Regnitz;</HI> and so vpon an hill by nature strongly situate, and free from hostile incursions, they built them a rude and homely castle, as the Chronicles of <HI>Bauaria</HI> doe beare record. Within a while their number was increased by the neighbour-husbandmen and the shepheards of the forrest <HI>Hercynia:</HI> and so of a medley of diuers sorts and professions of people, they grew at last to the bignesse of a towne. But giuing themselues to a base and dissolute kinde of life, without gouernours, without lawes, and continually molesting the neighbour Pro∣uinces with riots and robberies, it seemed good to the German Emperours to send thither a colonie of olde souldiers, which might serue in stead of a ga∣rison for the place, to bridle their outrages, and to prescribe vnto them lawes of ciuilitie. Some report, that <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bauaria</HI> first brought it into the forme of a citie, adorned it with the church of <HI>S. Giles,</HI> enacted lawes, and enuironed the castle with a larger wall. Also, that <HI>Conradus</HI> the second ioined it to the Empire: for at the beginning it was a popular estate. One onely ciuill discord in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth, changed it into an <HI>Aristocratia,</HI> or gouernment of a few principall persons: by which meanes the whole authoritie came into the hands of the Senatours; who euer since haue vsed such equitie and moderation in their gouernment, as there hath not at any time in so great a multitude of common people, and diuersitie of nations, growen any notable sedition or pernitious mutinie. In the citie there are three degrees of people, that is to say, Senatours, Merchants, and Artizans. Ancient and honourable families there are 28. out of which alwayes are supplied new Senatours: who all of them are six and twentie in number. Thirteene of these, called Burgomasters, doe consult of matters of Estate: and the other thirteene they call Scabins, who being alwayes assisted by three stipendarie lawyers, doe vpon Court and Leet dayes execute iustice and decide controuersies among the citizens. It is forbidden by their ancient lawes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S.W. Her∣berts opi∣nion con∣firmed.</NOTE> that any professed lawyer, or any that beares the title of a Doctour, should be admitted to their senate, or to the gouernment of their Common wealth. Out of either of the said halfes or thirteenes they chuse euery Lunar moneth or new moone a new Consull; so that euery yeere the chiefe magistracie falles by turnes for the space of a moneth to euery man of both the foresaid thirteenes. Fiue there are of the same company, that in criminall causes do make in∣quiry, giue sentence, and allot punishment to malefactours. They haue likewise a Iudge or President for their suburbs, who executes iustice among the pesants and villageois. Out of the same company also, they yerely elect two Treasurers, men of sufficient yeeres, credit, and honesty, who take charge of the customes and reuenues of the whole citie, and haue the receit and disbursing of the same. All the said magistrates, and others that haue any au∣thoritie, are chosen only out of the foresaid number of Senatours. Two hundred there are yeerely nominated out of the three Estates and the whole citie, who once a yeere, or vpon any vrgent occasion, being assembled by the magistrates, do sit in common counsell. The State or company of mer∣chants, albeit very great and honourable, are freed notwithstanding from all publike offices, and endowed with most ample priuileges: wherefore fol∣lowing their priuate traffike, they do in this citie, as in a common ware-house, hoord vp the riches not only of <HI>Europe,</HI> but of the most remote coun∣tries and islands in the world. The labourers and artizans, which are the last and meanest degree, are suffered to haue no conuenticles nor meetings priuate or publike in the citie; no solemne banquets nor festiuall assemblies of many together, vnlesse it be for a matter of religion or some great fune∣rall: for they hold it a thing pernicious to the publike tranquillitie, hauing found by often experience, that most dangerous factions and seditions haue growen of such popular meetings, where people in their drunkennesse dispute of the Common-wealth: and that the like tumults haue bereft many ci∣ties of their libertie, and brought great calamities vpon them. Now if any quarrell or dissention arise among the common sort, it is not referred to the Masters or Wardens of their crafts and mysteries, but to the Senatours themselues; who presently appoint two arbitratours, to search into the cause, and to do their best to compound it. If they can not bring it to agreement, then it comes before the Senate; who hauing awarded the matter, do vnder a grieuous penaltie impose silence to both parties. With great seueritie they punish fightings, brawles, iniuries, and priuate quarrels, for the mainte∣nance of publike peace: insomuch as a man would thinke, that <HI>Minos</HI> and <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> gaue dayly sentence vpon their iudgement seats. Thus farre <HI>Pighius</HI> concerning the originall, the magistrates, and the common wealth of this citie. More you may reade in the same authour. The territories ad∣iacent being naturally barren and sandie are by the industrie of the people made fruitfull. In the same territorie stands <HI>Altorff,</HI> where not many yeeres since the States of <HI>Nurenburg</HI> instituted an Vniuersitie. <HI>Nurenburg</HI> is watered by the riuer <HI>Pegnitz,</HI> which it crosseth with many stone-bridges. In com∣passe it containeth eight miles. It is compassed with a double wall, whereon are 183. turrets, besides castles and fortresses. Concerning the originall, si∣tuation, maners and customes of this citie, you haue a notable discourse written by <HI>Conradus Celtis</HI> a Poet laureat.</P>

<HEAD>BOHEMIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Oannes Dubrauius</HI> in his Bohemian story describeth this region in maner following. <HI>Bohemia</HI> is situ∣ate in <HI>Germanie.</HI> East it extendeth to <HI>Morauia</HI> and <HI>Silesia,</HI> and west to <HI>Bauaria. Austria</HI> bordereth to the South, as <HI>Saxonie</HI> and <HI>Misnia</HI> do Northward. It is in forme of a <HI>Theater</HI> enuironed around by the forest or woods of <HI>Hercynia.</HI> Wherefore there is no great difference between the length and the bredth, containing not much aboue 200. miles a piece. <HI>Charles</HI> king of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> who afterward was Empe∣rour, diuided it into 12. regions, of which one only he named after the riuer <HI>Vultaw</HI> that runneth through <HI>Prage:</HI> the other eleuen he called by the names of their principall townes; some of them being so harsh of pronunciation, that a man shall hardly speake them, vnlesse he be a Bohemian borne or very skilfull in the language. The chiefe Bohemian townes lying towards <HI>Morauia</HI> are <HI>Mutha, Chrudima, Konignigretz, Pardubitz, Litomitz.</HI> Towards <HI>Bauaria</HI> you haue <HI>Glatow, Domazlitz, Misa</HI> and <HI>Tachow.</HI> On the side towards <HI>Austria</HI> the principall towne is <HI>Buduitz,</HI> with <HI>Cromlawe, Trebon, Hradeck:</HI> as likewise on the <HI>Misnian</HI> side stand <HI>Pons, Cadana, Chomutawe, Austia:</HI> and on the Silesian quarter <HI>Iaromir, Glacitz, Curia,</HI> and some others. In the heart of the countrey the principall townes of note are <HI>Cuttenberg, Kolim, Pelsin, Veron, Zateckz, Launa, Slana, Lytomerick,</HI> and <HI>Tabor.</HI> But the head citie of all is <HI>Prage,</HI> being so great, as it containeth three faire cities within it, namely, the new, the old, and the little towne, which is disioyned from the two former by the riuer <HI>Vultaw.</HI> Their Buildings both Publique and priuat are stately and magnificall. This city hath two castles; one called <HI>Vissegard,</HI> whilom the Kings palace, but now waste and almost deso∣late, by meanes of ciuile warres. Again that other castle that ouer looketh the little towne, as it is named, so it well deserueth the title of the Royal or princely castle. For it resembleth rather a city then a Castle; filling vp so great a roome with the wals and buildings. Of publique edifices, the Church built by King <HI>Charles</HI> before mentioned; and the Castle erected by K. <HI>Vladislaus,</HI> late deceased, are the most memorable. And as <HI>Prage</HI> of all their Cities hath the preeminence; so hath <HI>Elbe</HI> (called by Tacitus re∣nowmed and famous) of all their riuers. Howbeit concerning the fountaine of this riuer Tacitus writeth skarce soundly, namely that it springeth in the region of the <HI>Hermonduri.</HI> For it ariseth not among the <HI>Hermonduri,</HI> but rather out of certaine Bohemian mountaines lying open to the North, vpon the frontiers of <HI>Morauia,</HI> which the ancient Bohemians call <HI>Cerconessi.</HI> From which mountaines this riuer refresheth and watereth the greater and better part of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and then hauing augmented his streames by the influence of <HI>Vultawa, Egra, Satzawa, Gitzera,</HI> and <HI>Misa</HI> his neighbour-riuers, continueth his course and name through <HI>Misnia</HI> and <HI>Saxonie</HI> to the maine Ocean, being all that way enriched with abundance of Salmons. But the smaller riuers and freshets of <HI>Bohemia</HI> yeeld in some places graines of gold, and in others shell-fishes containing pearle. Heere also you haue certaine hot bathes both pleasant and medicinable. And all the whole countrie so aboundeth with graine, as it affoordeth plenty to the neigh∣bour-regions. Wines there are no great store: and those of the countrey so weake, as they last but a very small time. Howbeit they haue saffron of the best, excelling both in colour, smell, and moisture, three principall properties to chuse that commoditie by. There are siluer-mines so exceeding rich, that were it not for some small quantitie of flint that insinuates it selfe into the veine, you should haue nothing but perfect siluer: whereas in other countries those mines are esteemed of high price, that hold a quarter or a fift part, or at the vtmost one halfe of good siluer. They find also plenty of gold-ore in certaine mines which take their name of a place called <HI>Giloua.</HI> It is reported that the Kings of <HI>Bohemia</HI> haue had graines of pure gold brought from thence weighing tenne pound a piece. Neither are they destitute of baser metall: namely, tinne, lead, copper, and yron. And some∣times they finde in those mineral rockes, the carbuncle, the Saphyre, and the Amethist. Next vnto their mines there is nothing of greater account to the Bohemians then their waters replenished with carps: which I haue declared more at large in a peculiar booke treating of fish-pondes. Now let vs decypher the disposition of the inhabitants. In briefe therefore, both in maners, habit, and stature of body the Bohemians resemble the Lion king of beasts, vnder whose constillation they are subiect; that is to say, if you consider either the largenesse of their limbs, their broad and mightie breastes, their yellow shag-haire hanging ouer their shoulders, the harshnesse of their voice, their sparkling eies, or their exceeding strength and courage. The Lion carries a kind of contempt and disdainefull pride ouer other beastes, and hardly shall you vanquish him, if you assaile him by force. Neither doth the Bohemian in this respect degenerate but soone shewes his contempt towards other nations both in word and deed, and dis∣couers his arrogancie both in his gate, gesture, and pompe. Being set light by, he growes impatient; in any enterprize he is as bold as a Lion, and most firme and constant till he hath brought it to execution, but not without a touch of ambition and vaine glory. Moreouer like a lion he is greedie of his meat, and very curious in the dressing and seasoning thereof. And their neigh∣bours the <HI>Saxons</HI> haue taught them to carouse both day and night. And by reason of their neighbourhood the Bohemians differ not much from the Germans in other qualities. Hitherto <HI>Dubrauius,</HI> by whom also the originall and ancient dwelling place of this nation is described. They brew excellent ale in this countrey, calling it Whiteale. They speake the Sclauon tongue, calling themselues <HI>Czecks,</HI> and the Germans <HI>Niemecks.</HI> Vnder the stile of this kingdome are also comprized the regions of <HI>Morauia, Silesia,</HI> and <HI>Lusatia.</HI> Likewise in the yeare 1315. the city <HI>Egra</HI> became the warehouse or principall mart towne of the Bohemians. Con∣cerning the region it selfe you may read more largely in <HI>Aeneas Siluius;</HI> and of the people, in the first booke of <HI>Martinus Cro∣merus</HI> his Polonian story. Vnto these you may adde <HI>Munster, Rithaimer, Crantzius</HI> in his description of <HI>Wandalia,</HI> and <HI>Sabellicus En.</HI> 10. <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Panthaleon Candidus</HI> wrote of late seuen books entitled <HI>Bohemaidos. Prage</HI> the head citie of this Kindome, is peculi∣arly described by <HI>Georgius Handschius.</HI> The Map it selfe we borowed out of the Table of <HI>Ioannes Crigingerus,</HI> published at <HI>Prage</HI> 1568.</P>
<P>The diuers appellations of certaine cities in this Kingdome we thought good here to put downe out of <HI>Munster.</HI> For the names of all their cities, are by the Bohemian pronounced after one maner, and by the German after another.</P>

<HEAD>SILESIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">J</SEG>Ohn Crato</HI> one of the Emperours counsellers, and his principall Physician, hath for the benefit of the studious in Geography, out of his relations of <HI>Silesia,</HI> imparted thus much vnto vs.</P>
<P>That we may not be scrupulous about the name of the Silesians, nor (as some haue done) deriue it from the Elysian fields: we are out of ancient writers to vnderstand, that the same region which they now possesse, was formerly inhabited by the Quadi. For <HI>Quad</HI> in the Saxon or old German tongue, hath the same signification that <HI>Siletz</HI> hath in the Polonian or Sclauon. For they were a people that resorted hither out of sun∣dry places, more addicted to warre than peace, destroyers rather than builders, and im∣patient of all superioritie. The first King that bare rule ouer them was <HI>Boleslaus</HI> a Po∣lacke. He was borne in the yeere of our Lord 967. his mother a Bohemian, neece to Duke <HI>Wenceslaus</HI> by the brothers side. A sonne of his called <HI>Mieslaus,</HI> in the yeere 1001. was married to <HI>Rixa</HI> daughter of <HI>Erenfrid</HI> County Palantine, neece to the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the third, by his sister <HI>Melchitis:</HI> and this man was the first that receiued the kingly diademe from <HI>Otho</HI> the third. But after his decease the Polonians hauing by sedition expelled out of their kingdome the Emperours niece and his sonne <HI>Casimire, Conradus</HI> the Emperour reseruing to himselfe a certaine tribute, annexed <HI>Silesia</HI> to the crowne of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> This Emperour was an Vratislauian borne, and perhaps gaue the name of <HI>Vratislauia</HI> to his natiue citie, which is now commonly called <HI>Breslaw.</HI> But hereof I cannot certainly affirme ought. This one thing is not to be doubted, that the Silesians had no affection towards the Polonians, whenas by the practise and industry of <HI>Iohn</HI> the first king of <HI>Bohemia</HI> father to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth, they vnited themselues to the Bohemians. Some there are (by what authority or opinion I know not) which affirme that in the same place where <HI>Breslaw</HI> now stands, was built in times past by a Prince called <HI>Liguis,</HI> the city of <HI>Budurgis</HI> mentioned in <HI>Ptolemey.</HI> For it is apparent out of histories, that <HI>Mieslaus</HI> Duke of <HI>Poland,</HI> who was first created King by the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the third, and in the yeere 965. embraced Christianitie, did <HI>anno</HI> 1048. erect a woodden church or chapel to the honour of <HI>S. Iohn Baptist.</HI> Whereby you may gather, that in those dayes there was no great matter of building at <HI>Breslaw.</HI> Moreouer, <HI>Gotefridus</HI> the first Prelate of that church being an Italian, preferred the village of <HI>Smogra</HI> before the citie of <HI>Breslaw,</HI> hauing there his Schole and College. Likewise about this time it is thought that the foundations of other the principall cities of <HI>Silesia,</HI> namely of <HI>Lignitz, Glogaw, Lu∣ben,</HI> &amp;c. were layd: for out of monuments and Annales no certainty can be gathered, whenas the ancientest wri∣tings in all <HI>Silesia</HI> are the letters of the Emperour <HI>Frederick</HI> the second, which were written in the yeere 1200. all the residue being consumed and lost, either by fires or inuasions which haue beene very terrible in these parts. But by the good indeuour of <HI>Frederick Barbarossa, Silesia</HI> was both pacified, and so distributed among the sonnes of <HI>Vladislaus</HI> king of <HI>Poland,</HI> that it seemed not altogether to be dismembred from that crowne. But when the Poloni∣ans perceiued that <HI>Silesia</HI> grew full of Germans, and that the Princes began to fauour them; reiecting the lawfull heires, they aduanced to the kingdome of <HI>Silesia</HI> one <HI>Vladislaus Locticus,</HI> a cruell enemy to the Germans. This was the occasion that they betooke themselues to the protection of <HI>Iohn</HI> king of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> who being sonne to the Em∣perour <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth, married the daughter of <HI>Wenceslaus</HI> king of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and was inuested into the king∣dome 1302. Wherefore after the decease of this <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Lucelberg, Silesia</HI> was subiect to twelue Bohemian kings one after another, six whereof were Emperours, one a Bohemian, another an Hungarian, fiue of the house of <HI>Au∣stria,</HI> two Polacks, but descended from <HI>Austria</HI> by the mothers side. Of the Polonian race remained as yet in <HI>Si∣lesia</HI> the Princes of <HI>Lignitz</HI> and <HI>Teschnitz:</HI> for those of <HI>Munsterberg</HI> deriue their pedegree from <HI>George</HI> king of <HI>Bo∣hemia. Vratislauia</HI> the head-city of <HI>Silesia</HI> being burnt to ashes in the yere 1341, began then so stately to be built of stone, as at this present both for order and beauty of houses and largenesse of streets, it is little inferiour to any of the cities in <HI>Germanie.</HI> Concerning other more true ornaments of a Common-wealth, I shall not need to speake, seeing it is manifest to all <HI>Germanie,</HI> that scarse in any other region there are to be found so many Schooles, such numbers of learned Professours, and of excellent wits. It beseemes me not to speake too gloriously of my coun∣treymen; yet thus much I may boldly say, that there is almost no Princes court, nor any famous common-wealth, where the vertue and learning of the Silesians findes not entertainment. The gentlemen likewise albeit addicted to tillage and good husbandry, yet are they so warlike withall, that no indifferent Iudges can deny, but that by their valour the remainder of <HI>Hungarie</HI> is defended. It is a region very fruitfull of corne, especially in one place aboue the rest, which is most carefully manured by our people. It aboundeth with fish-pooles. The famous riuer <HI>Odera</HI> confineth it East and North, and South it is diuided from <HI>Bohemia</HI> by <HI>Sudetes.</HI> But the situation best appeareth in the Map. Of <HI>Silesia</HI> you haue somewhat written by <HI>Aeneas Syluius,</HI> and by others which are ignorant of the coun∣trey. But <HI>Laurentius Coruinus</HI> could haue brought more certainties to light, had not the age wherein he liued been fatally ouerwhelmed in ignorance. Thus much <HI>Iohn Crato</HI> concerning his natiue countrey <HI>Silesia.</HI> It containeth twelue Dukedomes; one Bishoprick, the Bishop whereof hath his residence at <HI>Neisse,</HI> and sometimes at <HI>Breslaw:</HI> for there is a Cathedrall church and a College of Canons. Heere are foure Baronies also. In this region about <HI>Striga</HI> and <HI>Lignitz</HI> is found a kinde of medicinable earth, commonly called <HI>Terra sigillata,</HI> like that of <HI>Lemnus,</HI> and of equall force; some quantitie whereof <HI>Iacobus Manouius</HI> Citizen and Senatour of <HI>Breslaw</HI> hath often bestowed vpon me.</P>
<P>The Chronicles of <HI>Silesia</HI> were of late written by <HI>Ioachimus Curius,</HI> wherein he hath so curiously described the situation and the antiquity of their townes and cities, the gouernment of their state, and their memorable acts, that the studious may here finde an absolute history. I am informed by <HI>Iacobus Monauius,</HI> that <HI>Francis Faber</HI> hath described it in verse also.</P>

<HEAD>MORAVIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>ORAVIA is thus described by <HI>Ioannes Dubrauius</HI> in his Bohemian story: <HI>Morauia</HI> was called of olde <HI>Marcomania,</HI> because it confined vpon <HI>Germany</HI> at that place, where <HI>Dariubius</HI> en∣treth <HI>Hungary.</HI> For <HI>Mark</HI> in high Dutch signifies a limit or confine, and thereupon <HI>Marco∣manni</HI> are such as inhabit the borders of a countrey. Concerning these people <HI>Arrianus</HI> in his relation of <HI>Germany,</HI> the farthest of these nations (saith he) are the <HI>Quadi</HI> and <HI>Marcomanni,</HI> then the Iazyges a people of <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> after the Getes, and lastly a great part of the Sarma∣tians. Howbeit, at this present, because it is bounded by the riuer <HI>Mora,</HI> from the same riuer the inhabitants are called <HI>Moraui,</HI> and the countrey <HI>Morauia.</HI> On three sides, as it now stands, it is diuided by mountaines, woods, forests, or riuers; on the East from <HI>Hungary,</HI> West from <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and North from <HI>Silesia:</HI> for on the South part towards <HI>Austria</HI> it is plaine, being some where separated therefrom by the riuer <HI>Thaysa,</HI> and in other places by another obscure riuer. The principall riuer in <HI>Morauia</HI> is <HI>Mora,</HI> which en∣uironeth the chiefe city called <HI>Olmuntz,</HI> and from thence running into <HI>Hungary,</HI> dischargeth himselfe with his tributary streames into the chanell of <HI>Danubius.</HI> For <HI>Mora</HI> receiuing into his bosome the riuer <HI>Nigra;</HI> and that of <HI>Switta,</HI> whereon standeth the city <HI>Brin</HI> next in dignity to <HI>Olmuntz;</HI> also <HI>Thaysa,</HI> which glideth along by the city <HI>Znaim</HI> famous for the death of <HI>Sigismund</HI> the Emperour; and lastly <HI>Igla</HI> passing by the city <HI>Igla;</HI> rendreth vp his owne and his neighbours substance to the great and renowmed <HI>Danubius.</HI> But the riuer <HI>Odera</HI> springing not far from <HI>Olmuntz,</HI> retaineth his name to the Ocean sea. Some thinke it is called by <HI>Ptolemey Viadrus. Odera</HI> is so na∣med of a word borrowed from fowlers, which call their watch-towers for the spying and taking of birds, <HI>Odri;</HI> and such towers you haue now in <HI>Morauia</HI> at the fountaine of <HI>Odera.</HI> Neither must we heere omit the riuer <HI>Hana,</HI> which albeit sometimes scant of water, yet doth it so moisten the neighbour-fields, being thereby the fer∣tilest in all the region, as the husbandmen in regard of their plentifull increase, call them the fat of <HI>Morauia.</HI> Here also more than in other places are found the siluer and gold coines of <HI>M. Antoninus,</HI> of <HI>Commodus,</HI> and other Em∣perours. Which is a manifest argument of ancient warres betweene the forces of the Empire and the Marco∣mans in these parts.</P>
<P>This one thing is most worthy the admiration, that in <HI>Morauia</HI> there is a kind of Frankincense &amp; Myrrhe, not distilling out of trees as in other countries, but digged from vnder the ground, in one place only called <HI>Gradisco,</HI> where till this present is found not only Frankincense called Male frankincense in regard of the resemblance it hath with the priuie parts of man; but also in the shape of other members both of man and woman. And of late <HI>VVenceslaus</HI> of the noble family surnamed <HI>à Quercu,</HI> as he was making a foundation for the banke of a fish-poole in his field of <HI>Sterenberg,</HI> he found the intire body of a man, consisting all of Myrrhe, the which distributing vnto his friends, and remembring me among the rest, bestowed on me more than halfe an arme, which I vsed often for a perfume.</P>
<P>The inner part of the region is arable, an exceeding fertile and fat soile, and most apt for corne: as the hilles for vines, being more fauourable to <HI>Bacchus</HI> than the hilles of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> wherefore it excelleth for abundance of good wine. And it is so generally manured, and hath such plentie of husbandmen, that vnlesse it be in forests and desert places, heere is no pasture at all for the feeding of cattell. For the rest, both in speech, fashions and customes, they are like the Bohemians. Hitherto <HI>Dubrauius.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeere 895. the people of this region were instructed in the Christian faith by <HI>S. Methodius,</HI> at the pro∣curement of <HI>Arnulphus</HI> the Emperour. Vnder the Emperour <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in the yeere 1086. this countrey, together with <HI>Lusatia</HI> and <HI>Silesia,</HI> was annexed to the kingdome of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> Their language is mixt, for the grea∣test part speake Bohemian, and the high Dutch is vsed only in cities among persons of best account. This Pro∣uince (as <HI>Dubrauius</HI> writeth) yeelds plentie of wine, but not of the strongest; such (saith <HI>Rithaimerus,</HI> and I my selfe haue so found it by experience) as exempteth not the drinker quite from care. <HI>Duglossus</HI> in his Polonian sto∣rie saith that the name of the riuer <HI>Odera</HI> signifies in the Henetian tongue, inundation or robbery. <HI>Olmuntz</HI> the head citie of this region, and the seat of a Bishop, is described by <HI>Stephanus Taurinus</HI> in his <HI>Stauromachia.</HI> Concer∣ning <HI>Morauia,</HI> besides <HI>Dubrauius,</HI> reade <HI>Aeneas Siluius</HI> in his Bohemian story.</P>
<P>This Map of <HI>Morauia</HI> first drawen by <HI>Fabricius,</HI> but afterward corrected by diuers gentlemen of the countrey was sent me by <HI>Iohn Crato</HI> Counseller and principall Physician to the Emperour <HI>Maximilian</HI> the second a bounti∣full fauourer of these my studies. He gaue me also this catalogue of townes called both by German and Bohe∣mian names.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>EORGE RITHAYMER, in his Abridgement of the situation of the world, de∣scribeth <HI>Austrich</HI> vnder the name of <HI>Pannony</HI> the higher, in these words: <HI>Pannony</HI> the higher (saith he) toward the East abbutteth vpon the riuer <HI>Leyth. Ptolemey</HI> maketh the riuer <HI>Rab</HI> his Eastern bound. Vpon the West it is bounded with the riuer <HI>O∣nasus,</HI> and <HI>Noricum</HI> which is a part of <HI>Bayern.</HI> Some do on that coast limit it with the mountaine <HI>Caetius:</HI> on the North with the riuer <HI>Tey</HI> and the countrey <HI>Mora∣uia:</HI> for so farre at this day it doth extend it selfe on that side. Vpon the South coast it resteth vpon the mountaines of <HI>Steyri.</HI></P>
<P>The soile is good and fertile of all maner of corne, and is such as is manured and tilled with small charge. In that part which is beyond <HI>Donaw</HI> and is called <HI>Marchfield,</HI> where long since the <HI>Chetuari</HI> and and <HI>Parmecampi</HI> were seated, the husbandman falloweth his land with one poore seely jade only. Marle, without which their land in <HI>Bayern</HI> is leane and barren, what it meaneth the husbandmen of <HI>Austrich</HI> know not. It beareth so good Saffron, as no other in the world may compare with it. It affoordeth Wine passing holesome and agreeable to the nature of man. <HI>Althamerus</HI> vpon <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> his <HI>Ger∣mania</HI> writeth that it yeeldeth plentie of Ginger in a mountaine neere the towne <HI>Hamburg</HI> in the middest of <HI>Austrich</HI> or <HI>Pannony.</HI></P>
<P>It hath many ancient and famous cities: notwithstanding those of greatest note are <HI>Styre, Vadenhoff, Melck, Castell,</HI> anciently called <HI>Claudionum, Crembs, Cetro</HI> castle now called <HI>Zeisselmaur, Saint Hippolytus,</HI> the two <HI>Newberies,</HI> one surnamed of the Abbey, the other of Corne. <HI>Petronell</HI> a village now, but in old time a great citie, as his foundation, ruines, and heaps of stones and rubbish do testifie. The new city <HI>Pruck</HI> vpon the banke of the riuer <HI>Leyth</HI> and <HI>Hamburg:</HI> out of all the most famous is <HI>VVien</HI> sometime called <HI>Fla∣uiana</HI> and <HI>Iuliobona,</HI> renowmed for the Vniuersitie and Schoole, than which there is none that hath brought forth more excellent and greater Mathematicians. This citie is round beset with Vineyards. The houses of the citizens are stately and beautifull, so that they may seeme to giue entertainment to Princes, and are built with large and open windowes to let the aire in and out: and therefore they are neuer pestered and offended with close and bad aire; for that euery priuate house hath either his seue∣rall court-yard or back-side. Hither is great concourse of forren nations from all countreys of <HI>Europe.</HI> Here is great plentie of all maner of prouision necessary for the maintenance of mans life.</P>
<P>The riuers of <HI>Austrich</HI> are <HI>Donaw,</HI> sometime the vtmost border of the region, but now it runneth thorow the midst of the same; <HI>Onasus, Drawn, Erlaph,</HI> which at <HI>Cella</HI> (or <HI>Zelltal,</HI> famous for the Church of the Virgine <HI>Marie</HI>) ariseth out of a most pleasant lake: <HI>Draisn, Ypsie, Melck, Marck.</HI> These doe seuer <HI>Morauia</HI> from <HI>Austrich: Camb</HI> a notable riuer for sundry sorts of fish: <HI>Leytte,</HI> and <HI>Swegad</HI> in which are Cre∣fishes or Crabs of a most pleasant taste. Thus farre <HI>Rithaymer.</HI></P>
<P>Of the originall and reason of the etymologie of the name of this countrey, this report <HI>Lazius</HI> in his Commentaries of <HI>VVien</HI> doth giue. The name of <HI>Austria,</HI> (saith he) was inuented of late, about foure hundred yeeres since, of the blast of the South winde called of the Latines <HI>Auster,</HI> which winde in this country bloweth oft: or of the similitude of the German name; (which I thinke to be more likely) for the Kings of the Franks called the East border of their Kingdomes <HI>Ostenrich,</HI> like as the West part they termed <HI>Westenrich.</HI></P>
<P>This region long since was first gouerned by Marquesses, then by Dukes; and lastly by Archdukes; to whom it is now subiect: as is more at large to be seene in the said Commentaries of <HI>Lazius.</HI> The an∣cient armes of this countrey were fiue Larkes Ore, in a field Azure: but <HI>Lupold</HI> the Marquesse, the fift of that name, of an accident or euent that befell him, was licenced by the Emperour to alter his coat, and to beare a field Gules with a fesse argent: for that in the siege and assault of <HI>Accon</HI> he was all ouer em∣brued with bloud, onely his girdle excepted. More thou maiest reade of this in <HI>Munster</HI> and <HI>Cuspinian.</HI> The description of <HI>Austrich</HI> is to be seene in <HI>Bonfinius</HI> in the end of his fourth booke fourth Decade of his historie of <HI>Hungarie. Pius</HI> the second in his description of <HI>Europe</HI> citeth an historie of his, written of this countrey: which notwithstanding as yet it was neuer our chance to see. The same authour hath in his Epistles passing well described <HI>Vienna</HI> or <HI>VVien,</HI> the chiefe citie of this Prouince.</P>

<HEAD>The Bishopricke of SALCZBVRG.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>RANCIS IRENICVS saith, that of the fiue Bishopricks of <HI>Bayern,</HI> this is the principall, and the Bishops sea (termed of <HI>Aeneas Syluius</HI> the Metropoli∣tan citie) whose description we haue here set downe, is by <HI>Munster</HI> thus de∣scribed: <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> entending to make warre vpon the Germans, caused a very strong castle to be built in the streights of the mountaines, whither his souldiers in danger might retire themselues; and from whence they might haue succour when need required; and therefore it was called <HI>Castrum Iuua∣uiense,</HI> in the German tongue, <HI>Helfenberg.</HI> The riuer vpon which it standeth, called <HI>Iuuauius,</HI> is thought by some to haue giuen the name to this castle, of which also the citie af∣terwards built, was named <HI>Iuuauia.</HI> This citie hath Fennes, Plaines, Hilles and Mountaines round about belonging to it. The Fennes yeeld pastures; the Mountaines hawking and hunting. But this citie hauing long since flourished for a few yeres, in the time of <HI>Attila</HI> the King of the Hunnes, susteined many inrodes and incursions, and was miserably wasted with fire and sword. Afterward about the yeere of Christ 520, whenas <HI>S. Rupert,</HI> descended of the bloud royall of the Franks, was inuested Bishop of the sea of <HI>VVormes,</HI> and after the death of <HI>Childebert</HI> was driuen from that his Bi∣shopricke, <HI>Thedo</HI> Duke of <HI>Bayern</HI> entertained him at <HI>Ratispone</HI> with great ioy and solemnitie, and was baptized of him, with his Nobles and Commons. <HI>Rupert</HI> the Bishop going on visitation, and trauelling about by <HI>Noricum</HI> euen vnto <HI>Pannony,</HI> preaching the Gospell, conuerted many to the faith of CHRIST; and comming vnto the riuer <HI>Iuuaue,</HI> where sometime the citie <HI>Iuuawe</HI> had stood, but now ruined, decaied, ouergrowen with bushes, and without inhabitant; and obser∣uing the place fitting and conuenient for a Bishops sea, he obtained the possession thereof from the Duke, stocked vp the trees and bushes, and finding the foundation of the buildings, he erected there a Church, which he dedicated vnto the honour of <HI>S. Peter.</HI> Also by the bountifull magnifi∣cence of the same Duke, he erected a Monasterie of the order of <HI>S. Bennet,</HI> and gouerned the Bi∣shops sea foure and fortie yeeres &amp;c. The same authour in that place reckoneth vp also the rest of the Bishops and Archbishops of this sea. See <HI>Auentinus,</HI> who thinketh this citie to haue beene of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> called, <HI>Poedicum.</HI></P>
<P>This citie is seated amongst the Alpes. Some doe thinke it to haue beene named <HI>Saltzburg,</HI> of Salt, which in the countrey neere adioyning, not farre from <HI>Reichenhall,</HI> is digged out of the earth in great plenty. Yet who doth not see it, not to be called of them <HI>Saltzburg</HI> or <HI>Salisburg,</HI> but <HI>Salez∣burg</HI> of <HI>Salcz</HI> or <HI>Salczach</HI> the riuer, vpon which it is built and situate, like as <HI>Insperg, Instadt,</HI> of the ri∣uer <HI>In; Iltzstadt,</HI> vpon <HI>Iltz; Regensperg,</HI> vpon <HI>Regen;</HI> not farre from this place, and a thousand such euery where to be obserued.</P>
<P>The territorie and liberties of this citie is rich of all sorts of mettels, as of Golde, Siluer, Brasse, and yron. Here is also found Vitrioll, Brimstone, Alume, and Antimonie. It hath also some quar∣ries of Marble. <HI>VViguley Hund</HI> hath set forth a catalogue of the Bishops of this citie. The Iournall of <HI>Antoninus</HI> maketh mention of <HI>Iuuaue.</HI> But <HI>Gaspar Bruschius</HI> thinketh the more ancient name of <HI>Iuuaue</HI> to haue beene <HI>Helfenberg:</HI> and of that the name <HI>Iuuaue</HI> to haue beene formed, which in signi∣fication is the same. <HI>Pighius</HI> writeth, that he hath read these verses in the chiefe church of this city.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Ayern</HI> or <HI>Bauiere,</HI> called of the Latines <HI>Boiaria,</HI> or as others like better, <HI>Ba∣uaria,</HI> was inhabited in former times by the <HI>Narisci, Vindelici</HI> and <HI>Norici.</HI> The Nariskes, which now are called <HI>Nardge,</HI> the riuer <HI>Donaw</HI> parteth from the other two. The Noricks did enter at the riuer <HI>In,</HI> and doe decline toward the East and West, euen vnto <HI>Hungarie</HI> and <HI>Italie.</HI> The Ʋindelicks were conteined betweene the riuers <HI>Lyke, Donaw, Isara, Inne</HI> and the <HI>Alps,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth <HI>Penninae.</HI> All this part now is vnder the dominion of the Dukes of <HI>Bayern,</HI> and doth wholly rest in the name of <HI>Bayern. Bayern</HI> is diuided into the Higher and the Lower. <HI>THE HIGHER</HI> is situate vnder the <HI>Alps,</HI> and toward the South. This is combred with many mari∣shes, huge lakes, swift streames, darke and fearefull woods. Besides beares, bores, and such like wild beasts, it hath many heards of stags of an hundred yeeres old, which no man may hunt without the Princes leaue, but vnder a great penaltie. It is a good soile for pastorage, and for the feeding of cat∣tell. It yeeldeth yeerely great plentie of Apples, Barley, Oats, and such like corne, although not of all sorts: it is inhabited but here and there. The cities of this countrey are <HI>Munchen</HI> vpon the banke of the riuer <HI>Isara,</HI> a most goodly and famous citie, and the Dukes seat. This citie continually main∣teineth Lions. Many men do thinke it to surpasse all the cities of <HI>Germany</HI> for beautie. <HI>Ingol∣stadt,</HI> adorned with a publike Ʋniuersitie. Beside these, there are <HI>Freising</HI> a Bishops sea, <HI>Was∣serburg, Neuburg, Rosenhaim, Auensburg,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>THE LOVVER BAYERN</HI> is more fertile, and better inhabited: and by reason of the riuers <HI>Donaw, Isara,</HI> and <HI>Lauar,</HI> it bring∣eth forth Ʋines. His cities are <HI>Regensburg,</HI> which some call <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> formerly called <HI>Au∣gusta Tiberia,</HI> situate vpon <HI>Donaw:</HI> whose suburbs vpon the opposite banke of the riuer, are ioy∣ned to it by a faire stone bridge. <HI>Patauium</HI> commonly called <HI>Passaw,</HI> at the mouth of the riuer <HI>In,</HI> where it falleth into <HI>Donaw,</HI> famous for his Bishops sea: <HI>Strawbing, Landshut, Dinglesing, Osterhoff,</HI> and diuers others.</P>
<P>This countrey generally is reasonably fertile: as of Salt, Corne, Cattell, Fish, Woods, Birds, Pastures, Deere, and of all such things necessarily required to the maintenance of mans life, either for apparell or victuall, it is sufficiently stored. It breedeth many swine, feeding and fatting them with mast and wildings, in such sort, that as <HI>Hungary</HI> affoordeth Oxen, so this Swine to the most countries of <HI>Europe.</HI> Salt, Cattell and Corne are transported from hence, and solde into forren coun∣tries. Wines are from other places, as out of <HI>Italie, Istria, Rhetia, Rheni, Nicker</HI> and <HI>Panno∣ny,</HI> conueyed hither. But no Prouince of <HI>Germanie</HI> is beautified with more and finer cities: for within his borders (as <HI>Philip Apian</HI> in his Map of <HI>Bayern</HI> writeth) it conteineth foure and thir∣tie cities, six and fortie townes, (<HI>Mercktflecken</HI> they call them) threescore and twelue monaste∣ries, beside an innumerable company of villages, castles, and noblemens houses. In it <HI>Salczburg</HI> is the Metropolitan citie and the Archbishopricke, which hath vnder it many Suffragans, as of <HI>Trent, Passaw, Wien,</HI> &amp;c. The people do rather giue themselues to husbandrie and grasing than to warfare, neither do they delight in merchandise and traffique; they be much giuen to drin∣king and venery. They seldome trauell forth of their owne countrey. The first authour of this na∣tion was <HI>Alemanus Hercules,</HI> the eleuenth King of High <HI>Germanie.</HI> His name as yet is pre∣serued in this countrey in the village and castle <HI>Almonstain,</HI> and the riuer <HI>Aleman.</HI> In time past this countrey was ruled by his proper King vntill the dayes of <HI>Arnulph</HI> the Emperour: him, as the Parthians, <HI>Arsaces;</HI> the Egyptians, <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> they called <HI>Cacan.</HI> After that it had Dukes, which as yet it reteineth. <HI>Marke,</HI> a certaine disciple of <HI>S.

<HEAD>NORTGOIA, or the Countie Palatine of BAYERN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He other part of <HI>Bayern</HI> which is on the other side <HI>Donaw,</HI> and runneth out be∣yond the Bohemian wood, is called in our time (and long since was) <HI>Nortgoia,</HI> ha∣uing <HI>Noremberg</HI> for the chiefe citie, from whence the country, as some men thinke, tooke his name. And although that <HI>Noremberg</HI> be no ancient citie, yet his castle, situate vpon the toppe of an hill, is very ancient. This region hath many townes, monasteries and villages, especially <HI>Amberg,</HI> which in the yeere of Christ 1300. was enclosed with a wall. <HI>Awerbach, Sultzpach, Castell Munster,</HI> (where in old time the Princes of <HI>Nortgoia</HI> haue held their Court) <HI>Eger, Beierut, Eister, Napurg, Newenstadt, Rewenkelm, Kemnat, Krusen, Greuenwerdt, Eschenbach, VVeiden, Pernaw, Pleistein, Herspruck, Rurbach, Neumarckt, Tursenrut, Elbogen, Cham, Schonsee, Kunsperg, Stauff, &amp;c.</HI> Which for the most part do belong vnto the Pala∣tine Princes. For <HI>Lewis</HI> the Emperour and Duke of <HI>Bayern,</HI> in the yeere of CHRIST 1339. made such a diuision, that of the whole prouince of <HI>Bayern,</HI> the prouince of <HI>Nortgoia</HI> should be subiect vnto the Pala∣tine Princes, except only certaine townes which should belong to the Emperour: and many also that did appertaine to the crowne of the Empire, in time past haue beene pawned to the Princes of <HI>Bayern.</HI></P>
<P>In this Prouince, betweene <HI>Bamberg</HI> and <HI>Neremberg,</HI> in the East, toward the towne <HI>Eger,</HI> there is a great mountaine called <HI>Fichtelberg,</HI> out of which do issue foure riuers, <HI>Meane, Nabe, Sala</HI> and <HI>Eger.</HI> This moun∣taine conteineth in compasse about six miles, it bringeth forth diuers kinds of mettals: it yeeldeth the best blew colour, which commonly they call Azure. In the toppe of the mountaine there is also found Tinne, and many caues, out of the which in former times mettals haue beene digged: generally all that whole prouince euery where swelleth with mines, especially of iron, by which meanes the Nortgoians do yeerely reape great profit. Otherwise the soile is hard and rough, although in some places it doth bring forth good store of graine, and is excellent pasture ground. This Prouince of <HI>Nortgoia</HI> conteineth one of the foure Earledomes or Landtgrauies, which long since were erected by the Emperors, namely, <HI>Luchtenberg,</HI> which taketh his name of the castle <HI>Luchtenberg,</HI> notwithstanding that the Princes of that iu∣risdiction doe keepe their Court in the towne of <HI>Freimbd,</HI> and sometime in <HI>Grunsfelden,</HI> the situation of which towne thou mayest see in the Mappe.

It is apparent out of old records, that it hath beene sometime vnder the iurisdiction of the citie <HI>Trier.</HI> Afterward it was gouerned by Earles (although not in that sence in which commonly the word is vsed now-a-dayes) yet they not∣withstanding were subiect vnto the Duke of <HI>Mentz,</HI> as the foresaid booke of Records doth shew. At this day it is dignified with the title of a Landtgrauie.

<HEAD>The Dukedome of WIRTEMBERG.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Ohannes Pedius Tethingerus</HI> in his history of the famous acts of this countrey, describeth this Prouince thus: The countrey of <HI>VVirtemberg;</HI> saith he, in the very entrance almost of high <HI>Germany,</HI> most pleasantly abbutteth vpon the coast of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> situate especially vpon the bancke of the riuer <HI>Nicher,</HI> (some doe thinke it in former times to haue beene the an∣cient seat of the <HI>Charitini</HI>) whose iurisdiction is very large. On the East it bordereth vpon the <HI>Sueui, Vindelici</HI> and <HI>Norici:</HI> On the West vpon the Countie Palatine of <HI>Rhein,</HI> the Prince Electour, and Marquesse of <HI>Baden:</HI> lastly it comprehendeth the mountaines of <HI>Swartz∣wald,</HI> the Blacke-wood. On the South the mountaines of <HI>Arbon</HI> and the Alpes of <HI>Switzer∣land</HI> (so the inhabitants do call the higher mountaines of that countrey) do ioyntly ouerlooke it. On the North they haue the Franckes their neighbours, and not farre off also, is <HI>Othos</HI> wood. And therefore the iurisdiction of <HI>VVirtemberg</HI> can not more fitly take his begginning, than where <HI>Nicher</HI> ariseth, which springeth from a small fountaine out of the high hilles of <HI>Arbona</HI> in the Dukedome of <HI>VVirtemberg,</HI> neere vnto the villages <HI>Schwenningen,</HI> in the confines of the towne <HI>Villing,</HI> not much more than fiue hundred pases from the fountaine of <HI>Donaw.</HI> Not farre from his fountaine it passeth by <HI>Rotwell,</HI> and leauing vpon the left hand the head of <HI>Blacke-wood,</HI> vpon the right, <HI>Switzerland</HI> Alpes, runneth by the Duchie of <HI>VVirtemberg</HI> with a wandering and crooked course (so saluting here and there certaine noble mens castles, and townes of the Roman Emperours) from his first rise the space of fiue dayes iourney more or lesse, being with diuers little streames from sundry places encreased and laden, and so made nauigable, at <HI>Heydelberg</HI> falleth very swiftly into the <HI>Rhein.</HI></P>
<P>The whole countrey, by reason of the nature of the soile, whether for tillage or otherwise in respect of the fertility, is not euery where alike. For that part where <HI>Nicher</HI> ariseth, and which bordereth vpon the <HI>Blacke-wood,</HI> as also that which is abbuttant vpon the Alpes of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> (situate betweene <HI>Donaw</HI> and <HI>Nicher</HI>) is somewhat rough, vnapt for vines, but yeelding indifferent good pasture for cattell. The soile within the Alps is stony, yet very good for corne: in like maner by the sides of <HI>Blacke-wood,</HI> the land is sandy of a red colour, which notwith∣standing is reasonable good corne ground. Euery where the nation is much giuen to breed and bring vp cattell. Nere vnto the forest of <HI>Blacke-wood</HI> there are recorded to be these Lordships, subiect vnto the Duchy of <HI>VVirtem∣berg: Hornberg, Schultach, Dornstad, Nagold, VVildberg, Kalbe, VVilde bath, Newenstade.</HI> By the Alps, or neere vnto them, these Lordships, <HI>Baling, VVrach, Blawbeyren, Heidenheim, Tuthing</HI> vpon the banke of <HI>Donaw,</HI> by the which, as by a certaine trench, they are seuered and diuided. But euery where the confines of the iurisdiction of <HI>VVirtemberg</HI> do gather themselues into a ring, as it were, enclosed with a large band, to the places neere to <HI>Nicher.</HI> But where∣as <HI>Nicher</HI> doth spread it selfe into the champian fields, there it is not only more kinde for temperature of the aire, but also the soile is more fit for tillage. Euery where are riuers well stored with fish, holesome springs, pleasant lakes, goodly valleys. Euery where hilles beset with Vines, well-grasing pastures and medowes, fertile fields, forests of woods and groues, in the which are great store of Beeches, many Okes, innumerable companies of Deeres, large pastures, abundance of cattell: in all places plenty of Wine, Corne and Apples.</P>
<P>Vpon the brinke of crooked <HI>Nicher,</HI> here and there, are many goodly cities; some of them of reasonable greatnesse, others not so bigge; but for building and beautie very glorious. In the higher countrey, vpon <HI>Ni∣cher</HI> doe stand <HI>Hernberg, Tubing, Nurting, Kurch:</HI> then <HI>Stutgard,</HI> which being built as it were in the center of the prouince, is the chiefe citie and the palace of the princes of <HI>VVirtemberg,</HI> and excelleth all the other cities in buil∣dings, multitude of people and greatnesse. About the lower coast of <HI>Nicher</HI> at this day doe flourish <HI>VVabling, Schrondorff, VVinida, Bachanauge, Brackenauge, Binnicke, Bessicke, Bieticke, VVinsberg, Megimill, Lauff, Greining, VVahing.</HI> Next vnto <HI>Statgard</HI> are <HI>Bebeling, Lenberg, Cannostade:</HI> all which cities haue their seuerall Lordships, many strong villages, men and munition. Moreouer, generally the people of this countrey is for their manhood, humanitie, constancie and religion very renowmed. The townes (as I said before) are not so great, but are sumptuously built; whereof some are sufficiently fortified by nature and benefit of the place; other some by the industrie and labour of man. The villages are so well inhabited, that they are not much inferiour to prety townes: their houses are of timber, but very artificially built. The castles are fortified by nature and situation, as also by the ingenious arte of fortification, and so are not easie to be surprised: so that a man would thinke that another <HI>La∣conia</HI> were yet extant amongst the Switzers; such is the excellencie of the men both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>This Dukedome hath his name of <HI>VVirtemberg</HI> an ancient beacon, which now is situate in the midst of his ter∣ritory, not very farre from <HI>Stutgard,</HI> yet vpon somewhat a rising ground &amp; hilly place, is neither for his strength nor building any terrour to the enemy. But according to the custome of their ancestours, who trusted rather to their swords of steele, than walles of stone, it was notable for the pleasantnesse of the place, only commendable now for his antiquitie, hauing a most goodly prospect round about; aboue are the woods of Beech, beneath are the fertile hilles of Vines &amp;c. The late Dukes of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> for many ages past, held their Court in this tower, taking from thence their name, their stocke, and their armes, as is to euery man very apparent. There are which thinke, that the Dukes of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> haue had their ofspring from the Tuscans or Rhaetians: others from the French. Whether of these opinions are more probable, I much regard not, for in a thing altogether vncertaine I affirme nothing constantly. It is certaine that they were strangers: whether they came first forth of <HI>Italie</HI> or from <HI>France,</HI> that as yet is not certainly knowen, &amp;c. Thus farre <HI>Iohn Pede.</HI></P>

Notwithstanding at this day there is none of the Princes of <HI>Germanie</HI> which is graced with the title of Duke of <HI>Switzerland:</HI> for it is now diuided amongst many Princes. One part hath accrued by lot of inheritance vnto the house of <HI>Austrich:</HI> the duke of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> enioyeth the greatest part: in it there are many free cities, and such as do belong vnto the crowne of the Empire: many are subiect vnto the Duke of <HI>Bauiere.</HI> There is none of the old writers which doth not make report of this Nation, as of the most noble and ancientest of all <HI>Germany.</HI> It is cleere out of <HI>Ptolemey, Strabo,</HI> and other authours, that heretofore they were seated vpon the riuer <HI>Sweue</HI> and <HI>Albis.</HI> But now at this day it is the vtmost prouince of all <HI>Germany,</HI> for it ab∣butteth vpon the Alpes. It is bounded by <HI>Bayern, Frankenland</HI> and <HI>Alsatia</HI> or <HI>Elsas,</HI> on euery side round about. In olde time this countrey was called <HI>Alemanie,</HI> of the lake <HI>Lemanus</HI> (vulgarly now called <HI>Lac de Losanne</HI> or <HI>Lac de Ge∣neue,</HI> the Germans call it, <HI>Ienfferlee</HI>) as some thinke.</P>
<P>The countrey, as <HI>Iohn Auban</HI> in that worthy worke of his, <HI>De moribus gentium,</HI> describeth it, is partly champian, partly hilly. The soile is fruitfull, of which there is no part which lieth vntilled, excepting that which Lakes, Mountaines or Woods do possesse. In it are many woods; and therefore the nation is giuen much to hunting and hawking: they haue abundance of corne, and great store of cattell. The whole prouince by reason of the holsomnesse of the aire is euery where replenished with goodly cities, villages, castles and bulwarks strongly fortified aswell by nature as arte. About the mountaines it yeeldeth iron, siluer, and other mettals. The nation is populous, stout, audacious, and warlike: and therefore <HI>Plutarch</HI> calleth it, The most excellent nation of all the Germans. Whose renowme is recorded to be such and so to be enlarged, that for valour and feats of armes it seemeth to haue deserued the Empire of the whole world: which indeed it hath most gloriously for the space of somewhat more than an hundred yeeres enioyed. Thus farre out of <HI>Iohn Auban,</HI> where thou mayest at large see the customes and maner of life of this nation.</P>
<P><HI>Augusta Vindelicorum, Augspurg</HI> vpon the riuer <HI>Lech,</HI> and <HI>Vlm</HI> vpon <HI>Donaw,</HI> are the most famous cities of this pro∣uince at this day. There are also <HI>Campodun, Memmingen, Werd, Nordling,</HI> and others, of which thou mayest reade in <HI>Munster. Donaw,</HI> the greatest riuer of all <HI>Europe,</HI> here taketh his beginning, and passeth thorow the middest of the countrey. This riuer, laden with threescore streames (which <HI>Cuspinian,</HI> according to the report of <HI>Collimitius,</HI> describeth by name and order) emptieth it selfe into <HI>Pontus Euxinus</HI> (the Greeks now call it, <HI>Maurothalassa;</HI> the Ita∣lians <HI>Marmaiore;</HI> the Turkes, as <HI>Busbequius</HI> affirmeth, <HI>Cara-denis,</HI> that is, The blacke-sea) by six huge mouthes. Euery one of which mouthes are so great, and the streame so violent, as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, that you shall obserue the sea to be ouer-mastered and driuen backe the space of fortie miles, and so farre the water to be perceiued to be sweet. Of this countrey and his people and first inhabitants, see the ancient Geographers: and of the latter wri∣ters, <HI>Iohn Auban</HI> of <HI>Bohemia, Munster</HI> and <HI>Irenicus,</HI> who affirmeth that <HI>Naucler</HI> hath penned certaine books only of this argument, and that <HI>Berno</HI> a certaine Abbat hath written many volumes of this nation.

At this day it is for the most part vnder the iurisdiction of <HI>Basell.</HI> In it as yet is there a village vpon the <HI>Rein,</HI> distant a Dutch mile from <HI>Basell,</HI> called <HI>Augst,</HI> sometime the chiefe citie of this nation, and was called <HI>Augusta Rauracorum;</HI> but now it is become a base village: notwithstanding many ap∣parent signes of decayed buildings, which as yet do testifie his antiquitie, we haue seene to remaine and be yet extant there. The country is rough, full of many cragged rocks, and euery where shadowed with thicke woods: yet is very well inhabited and manured: so that euen in the mountaines, besides the goodly pastures for cattell, of which it is greatly stored, it beareth plentifully very good wine and corne.</P>
<P><HI>Sequani CisIurani</HI> did long since reach from the mountaine <HI>Iura,</HI> euen vnto the banke of the riuer <HI>Rhein.</HI> Now this part is called <HI>Sungow,</HI> and the <HI>Higher Elsas,</HI> and is subiect for the most part vnto the Dukes of <HI>Austrich.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He <HI>Heluetij</HI> (which as <HI>Eutropius</HI> saith were in time past called <HI>Quadi) Caesar</HI> writeth to haue been diuided into foure <HI>Pagi.</HI> At this time they diuide it into thirteene parts, which they call <HI>Cantones</HI> or <HI>Angules. Heluetia</HI> they now call <HI>Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Eydg∣noschafft,</HI> of the league and confederacie which they haue made betweene them∣selues.</P>
<P>Some men doe thinke this countrey to be the highest of all <HI>Europe,</HI> for that it is wholly almost situate within the Alpes, the highest mountaines of the same <HI>Europe,</HI> and because the greatest riuers of the same, <HI>Rhein, Rhodan</HI> or <HI>Rosne,</HI> and <HI>Po,</HI> springing from hence as from a very high place, do runne into diuers coasts of the world. This countrey is euerie where full of steepe hilles, deepe valleys, great lakes, cleere springs and brooks. These mountaines do ap∣peare white with continuall snow, so that to those which behold them afar off, they seeme to be nothing but hard stone: yet notwithstanding the Medowes after they haue beene burnt, are found to be very fat. In them are fed sheepe and kine, from whence great profit ariseth vnto the inhabitants. For from thence whey, (as <HI>Oswaldus Molitor</HI> writeth) cheese, butter, and other white meats are made in such abundance, that not only <HI>Switzerland</HI> is glutted with such things, but also the nations nere adioyning are from thence very plentifully serued. For they are transported from hence into <HI>Sweueland,</HI> beyond the mountaine <HI>Iura</HI> into <HI>Italie,</HI> and into diuers other places. And that which may hardly be beleeued, as the same man affir∣meth for certaine, that of twentie kine the yeerely profit is one hundred crownes, and all charges borne which is bestowed vpon house-keeping, men-seruants, and maid-seruants. Here-hence it is, that so great a people is possibly able to liue and be mainteined in so strait a place and little plot of ground.</P>
<P>The thirteene Cantones of this countrey (as we said they are commonly called) are, as <HI>Glarean</HI> recko∣neth them vp, <HI>Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Wry, Schwitz, Siluan, Tugi, Glaron, Basell, Friburg, Solodurn Schafhusen,</HI> and <HI>Keiser-stul.</HI> The gouernment and charge generally of the whole countrey is in the hands of those Cantones: for the rule or gouernment of <HI>Heluetia</HI> is an <HI>Anarchia,</HI> and is not subiect to the command of any Prince. These, when there is any thing that falleth out which concerneth the whole countrey or gouern∣ment of the same, do meet all ioyntly together, and do determine vpon that which they thinke meet: o∣therwise seuerall magistrates do gouerne the seuerall cities. These cities therefore are linked together by a certaine bond of friendship and league, whereupon they are called <HI>Eydtgnossen,</HI> that is, ioyned in one couenant. Those of <HI>Rotweill, Sangall, Doggenburg,</HI> and <HI>Lepont,</HI> haue combined themselues also to those thir∣teene Cantons, with the like bond of amitie.</P>
<P><HI>Heluetia</HI> is situate (that we may describe it in the plainest maner) betweene the riuer <HI>Rhein, S. Claudius</HI> mountaine, the lake of <HI>Geneua,</HI> (which of the Latine writers is commonly called <HI>Lacus Lemanus</HI>) and <HI>Italie.</HI> Vpon the East it hath the countie of <HI>Tiroll:</HI> vpon the South, the Duchie of <HI>Millan,</HI> and the countrey of <HI>Pei∣mont:</HI> vpon the West it bordereth vpon <HI>Sauoy:</HI> the other part of it lieth vpon <HI>Burgundie, France,</HI> and <HI>High Germanie.</HI></P>
<P>We said, that <HI>Switzerland</HI> amongst the mountaines doth conteine many valleys: of which some there are, that do tend from the tops of the Alps toward <HI>Italie,</HI> inhabited of diuers kinds of men. For <HI>Giles Schude</HI> writeth, that those which do inhabit the vale of <HI>Augusta</HI> or <HI>Val de Osta,</HI> where in times past the <HI>Salassi</HI> dwelt, are for the most part all Merchants factors. In <HI>Cesie</HI> vale they are almost all Stone-cutters and Masons. From <HI>Oscell</HI> vale do come Cutlers or Smithes, which do make sword-blades, and kniues, and such as doe turne woodden dishes and trenchers. All the inhabitants of the vale <HI>Vegese</HI> are Chimney-sweepers, and so that slouenly kinde of men, which liue by sweeping of chimneys, and are wont to wander vp and downe thorow <HI>Germany, France, Italie,</HI> and euen as farre as <HI>Sicilia,</HI> are bred here. In the vale <HI>Galanch</HI> they are all ei∣ther dressers of Rosen, or Basket-makers. But these like beggers wander from countrey to countrey: yet all the rest do liue vpon their trades.</P>
<P>Besides that which <HI>Caesar, Strabo</HI> and other ancient writers haue written of this countrey, thou mayst reade many other things in <HI>Giles Schude, Vadian, Francis Niger</HI> of <HI>Bassana, Munster, Henry Glarean,</HI> and <HI>Oswald Molitor</HI> in the commentaries vpon him; as also in <HI>Iohn Stumpe,</HI> who hath written an huge volume of this nation. To these you may adioyne <HI>Iohn Rhellicanes</HI> his commentaries vpon <HI>Caesar. Iosias Simler</HI> hath set forth a booke of the prouince of <HI>Vallesia</HI> and of the Alps. The same man hath in hand a worke of <HI>Switzerland</HI> in generall. <HI>Nicolan Stupan</HI> of <HI>Rhetia</HI> promiseth a description of <HI>Rhetia.</HI> For the estate and gouernment of the common wealth of this countrey see <HI>Iohn Bodine</HI> in his <HI>Methodus historica. Anthony Pinet</HI> in his description of cities, hath diligently described the politicall estate and peculiar regiment of the Commonwealth of <HI>Berne. Giles Schude, Henry Glarean</HI> and others do contend and differ about the ancient language of the <HI>Hel∣uetij.</HI> I do thinke that they neuer vsed other than now they do. But we do send such as are more curious students in the dialects of languages, vnto the worke of <HI>Iohn Becan</HI> which he calleth his <HI>Becceselana.</HI></P>

For it payeth yeerely vnto the Prince (as <HI>Cuspinian</HI> in his historie of <HI>Austrich</HI> reporteth) three hundred thousand crownes of golde. Moreouer in it is found absolutely the best brasse, when as scarse other where not any is found that will abide the hammer.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F <HI>Windiskmarke, Istria,</HI> and <HI>Goerez,</HI> we must speake hereafter, and therefore in this place we will sursease to say ought of them. Of <HI>Carnioll, Karst,</HI> and <HI>Chaczeoll</HI> (to say the trueth) I know not what to write. Something notwithstanding, that otherwise than in the other, I do not deceiue the expectation of the Reader, that shall not be vnpleasant vnto those which doe admire the wonderfull works of the Almightie, I will speake in this place.</P>
<P>There is a place in this Map, which the inhabitants call <HI>Czyrcknitzersee,</HI> of a little towne neere vnto it, called <HI>Czyrcknitz, Lazius</HI> saith that <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth it the Mere of <HI>Lugey,</HI> it is situate in the prouince of <HI>Carnioll.</HI> This place (so I call it; for whether I may more truly terme it a lake, a parke, or a field, I know not) as the same <HI>Lazius</HI> hath, euery yeere yeeldeth corne, fishing and hunting. But here I thinke it best first to set downe his de∣scription out of <HI>George Wernher</HI> a little more at large: It is enclosed, saith he, on euery side with mountaines, and is in length about a mile and a halfe, but in bredth somewhat lesse. In many places it is eighteene cubits deepe, and where his depth is least, it is equall vnto the full height of a tall man. Out of the hilles round about on euery side certeine small brooks do runne, ech from his seuerall channell; from the East coast three; from the South, foure. Euery one of these the farther they runne, the lesse water they containe; for the earth so continually soa∣keth it vp, that at last it is wholly consumed by certeine stonie ditches, so framed by nature, as they do seeme to haue beene made and cut out by the arte and industrie of man. <HI>Lazius</HI> thinketh them to be certeine signes and arguments of the sailing of the Argonautes vnder the earth. Heere the waters doe so mightily swell, that by no meanes they may be receiued: whereupon it commeth to passe, that the ditches doe in such maner swell backe againe, that neither they only doe not receiue the water, but also what they haue receiued, they powre backe againe so exceeding swiftly, that a nimble horseman by running shall hardly be able to auoid the violence of the streame. Therefore which way soeuer the waters shall finde any way out, they issue forth and spread them∣selues so broad, that they make a great lake. These waters do returne almost as swiftly as they came, yet not by those ditches only; but the ground euery where almost doth so receiue them, as if they were powred thorow a sieue. This when the inhabitants do perceiue will come to passe, they by and by stopping the greater passages to the vttermost they may, they runne thither to fish by great troops: which is not only a pleasant passe-time to them, but also is very gainfull and profitable. For these fishes being salted, are carried out in great plentie vnto the neighbour-regions round about. Then the lake being dried, succeedeth an haruest, on that part where the soile is sowen; and the same is sowen againe before the next floud It is so fertile of grasse, that euery twentie dayes it may be mowen. Who is it, that which here doth not admire the wonderfull works of sporting nature?</P>

First, by the riuer <HI>Varus;</HI> then by a straight passing by Alpes <HI>Coctiae,</HI> now called <HI>Monte Genebrae;</HI> by Mount <HI>Adula,</HI> or S. <HI>Gothardes</HI> hill; the Alpes of <HI>Rhetia</HI> or <HI>Monte Braulis,</HI> and hilles adioyning; then by the riuer <HI>Arsia</HI> the vtmost border of <HI>Istria:</HI> thus it is bounded vpon one side, the other sides do abut vpon the sea. <HI>Ptolemey</HI> describeth it in the forme of an Isthmos or Peninsula, which the sea incloseth on three sides, the other is walled by the Alpes. The ancient writers doe liken it vnto an Oke-leafe: the latter doe set it out not without great resemblance in the proportion and shape of a mans legge from the hippe vnto the sole of the foot. <HI>Italie</HI> hath the mountaine <HI>Apennine</HI> as it were a ridge or backe passing along from one end of it to the other, like as we see in fishes the ridge bone to runne along from the head vnto the taile.

<P><HI>Plinie,</HI> according to the opinion of <HI>Varro,</HI> maketh the lake <HI>Cutilius,</HI> in the territorie of <HI>Reatino,</HI> to be the center of all <HI>Italie.</HI> Neere vnto this lake is the territorie of <HI>Rosella</HI> (called of <HI>Virgill, Rosaea rura velini; Velino's</HI> fields bedecked with roses sweet) of all <HI>Italie</HI> the most fertile: which fertilitie was such, as <HI>Varro</HI> witnesseth, that a rod being left in it ouer night, the next day it might not be seene for grasse; and therefore it is called <HI>Sumen Italiae,</HI> The sweet bread of <HI>Italie.</HI> In former ages they haue reported, that the plaine of <HI>Stellate</HI> was the goodliest and best soile of all <HI>Italie;</HI> but now, as <HI>Blondus</HI> saith, the places about <HI>Bonony</HI> and <HI>Mutina</HI> do far surpasse the rest. <HI>Sabellicus,</HI> according to the common report of the common people, attributeth these epithets vnto the chiefe cities of <HI>Italie: Venice</HI> the rich, <HI>Millane</HI> the great, <HI>Genua</HI> the proud, <HI>Florence</HI> the faire, <HI>Bonony</HI> the fertile, <HI>Rauenna</HI> the olde, <HI>Rome</HI> the holie, and <HI>Naples</HI> the noble. But the commendation of this country, set out by <HI>Plinie,</HI> with as great a maiesty of words, as that countrey doth excell the rest of the countreys of the world, I cannot but I must needs, before I passe from it, set downe in this place by way of digression; for so he speaketh of it in his third booke and fift chapter: ITALIE <HI>the nurse and mother of all nations, chosen by the prouidence of God, to adde a lustre to the very heauens themselues, to vnite dispersed kingdomes, to temper and mollifie their rude and vnciuill maners, to draw the dissonant, barbarous and sauage langua∣ges of so many diuers people, by the entercourse of one refined speech to a conference and parley, to teach ciuilitie to men, and briefly to make this one a common countrey for all the nations of the world. But what shall I say more? Such is the excellencie of all places, that any man shall come vnto, such is the maiestie of all things, and of all people which do possesse it. The citie of</HI> Rome, <HI>which in it see∣meth only to excell, and to be a worthy face for so glorious a necke, with what words or eloquence may I expresse it! How beautifull is the countenance of</HI> Campania <HI>by it selfe! how great and many are the glorious pleasures and delights of the same! That it is manifest that in this one place nature hath shewed all her skill in a worke wherein she meant especially to delight. And now indeed such is the vitall and continuall holsomnesse of the temperate aire, such fertile plaines and champian grounds, such sunny banks, such harmlesse forests, such coole and shady groues, such fruitfull and bountifull kinds of woods, such fertility of corne, vines annd oliues, such goodly flocks of sheepe, such fat beeues, so many lakes, such store of riuers and fountaines euery where watering and bedrenching it, so many seas, hauens or ports as it were bosomes of the land euery where open and ready to entertaine and receiue the traffique of all lands, and it selfe running into the sea as it were willingly offering it selfe and earnestly desiring to helpe and succour mortall men distressed in the same. I doe omit to speake of the fine wits, natures and maners of the people of the same, as also of the seuerall nations ouercome by it partly by valour, and partly by humanity. The Graecians themselues, a nation exceeding prodigall of their owne praise and glory, haue iudged so of it, calling a great part of it</HI> Magna Graecia, <HI>Great Greece.</HI></P>
<P>Of the ancient writers <HI>Caius Sempronius, Marcus Cato, Polybius</HI> in his second booke, but most exactly <HI>Strabo,</HI> as he doth all things els, haue described this countrey. Of the latter historiographers, <HI>Blondus, Iohannes Annius Viterbien∣sis</HI> in his commentaries vpon <HI>Berosus,</HI> and other authors imprinted together with him. <HI>Pontanus</HI> in his first booke of the famous acts of King <HI>Alphonsus, Volaterrane, Sabellicus, Bernardus Saccus,</HI> and <HI>Dominicus Niger,</HI> but most exactly <HI>Leander, Gaudentius Merula</HI> hath most excellently described <HI>Gallia Cisalpina,</HI> which indeed is not the least part of <HI>Italie.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He originall of the name of <HI>Forum Iulij, Leander</HI> saith, diuers writers haue diuersly sought and censured. Some doe thinke it so called of <HI>Iulius Caesar. Blondus</HI> seemeth to affirme it to haue tooke his name of the citie <HI>Forum Iulij.</HI> Antiquities do testifie that this region hath beene called <HI>Aquilegia,</HI> of <HI>Aquilegium</HI> his chiefe or metropoli∣tane city. Lastly, it is certaine that it is called <HI>Patria</HI> of the Venetians: which name as yet also it reteineth to this day. <HI>Blondus</HI> saith, that it was long since called <HI>Li∣burnia:</HI> but from whence, when, or for what cause it was so called, he sheweth not. The first that had here ought to doe, were the <HI>Euganei, Veneti, Troiani, Galli;</HI> and after those, the Romans: vnder whom it did continually persist, so long as the fortune and maiestie of the Roman Empire did stand sound and whole: which at last declining, it came into the hands and iu∣risdiction of the barbarous nations which oppressed <HI>Italie,</HI> especially the Lombards, and so remained vnto the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the great. After that, the gouernment thereof was in the power of the Patriarch of <HI>Aquileia,</HI> vntill at length the Venetians (desirous to enlarge their territories on this side) reduced it wholly vnder their iurisdiction, who at this day possesse it.</P>
<P>The situation of the region is thus: It beginneth from a plaine abbuttant vpon the sea, and so by a little and little encreasing, first it riseth vp in little hilles, and then into very high mountaines, which almost on euery side so enclose his borders, that this plaine enuironed about with the toppes of moun∣taines as with a wall, sheweth like a Theater, it is open but at one narrow straight, by the which, as by a gate, ferrying ouer the riuer <HI>Sontio</HI> from <HI>Taruisio,</HI> it may only be entred. The other borders of it, the Alpes on euery side doe limit: and therefore not to be come vnto but by the sea-ports or valleys of the mountaines, or els ouer their tops. It hath vpon the sea-coasts very many hauens. In this most good∣ly countrey are large champians watered with many pleasant streames, and those fields exceeding fer∣tile: for it aboundeth with vines, yeelding a kinde of wine, which <HI>Plinie</HI> reckoneth and commendeth for the best, and calleth it <HI>Vinum Pucinum,</HI> of the place. The mountaines of this countrey are very rich almost of all sorts of mettals; to wit, of Iron, Lead, Tinne, Brasse, Quicke-siluer, Siluer and Golde. They haue also Marble, white, blacke, and party-coloured: Pretious stones; as Carneols, Berylls, &amp;c. and crystall. Here are all sorts of fruits, and apples of a most excellent taste: Woods both for fuell, tim∣ber, and hunting, most stately: pleasant and beautifull meddowes, and pastures most excellent pastu∣rage for cattell. The aire is temperate. The fields of themselues doe abound with all things necessary for the vse of man, as also for pleasure and delight. The people of this countrey are most apt not only vnto all artes and liberall sciences, but also for all merchandise and such other trades of life. The most famous cities in it are <HI>Aquileya,</HI> adorned with the title of a Patriarchy. This citie <HI>Mela</HI> nameth, The rich: In times past it was the seat of the Emperours, and therefore it was called, Another <HI>Rome,</HI> and was in compasse twelue miles. In it there haue beene accounted long since an hundred and twentie thousand citizens. The great prosperitie and flourishing estate of this citie, especially grew by the great throng∣ing hither of Merchants; for that from all quarters almost of the world, by reason of the great com∣modiousnesse of the place, easie and safe entrance vnto it aswell by land as by sea, merchandise were conueyed to this citie as to a common ware-house. That great trade of merchandise ended together with the fortune of the citie, the Venetians growing mightie, and drawing vnto themselues all meanes of trade and traffique: so that now of a most flourishing and populous city, it is almost wast and desert. <HI>Vtina,</HI> which also is called <HI>Vtinum</HI> (the Italians vulgarly call it, <HI>Vdene;</HI> the Dutch <HI>Weyden</HI>) situate in a plaine, hath a strong castle built vpon the toppe of an hill, raised by the labour and industrie of man, contein∣ing at this day fortie furlongs in compasse. <HI>Tergeste Trieste</HI> vpon the sea shore, a colonie of the Romans. <HI>Goritia,</HI> sometime (if I be not deceiued) called <HI>Noreia.</HI> Here are many monuments of great antiquitie to this day remaining. The citie <HI>Austria</HI> (many thinke it in olde time to haue beene called <HI>Forum Iulij</HI>) situ∣ate in the straights of the mountaines, is a place strong and fortified by nature. Thorow the middest of it doth runne the riuer <HI>Natiso,</HI> vpon the which is a faire stone bridge.

The same riuer as it doth diuide it into two parts, so it doth almost on euery side enclose it round: so that it is not only a commodity vnto the citie, but al∣so a defence and ornament vnto the same. The soile of this tract is excellent good, yeelding many things necessary and profitable vnto it; Great store of oile and corne, yeelding yeerely great gaines vnto the country people by selling and trans∣porting it to forren nations; Woll for finenesse excelling the other sorts of <HI>Italie.</HI> The citie is most excellently and pleasantly seated, beautified with faire and goodly buildings, aswell priuate as publike. It hath many famous monuments of antiquitie worth the regarding: amongst the which is the Amphitheater, which the common sort call <HI>Arena,</HI> The sand; of all those which remaine in <HI>Italie</HI> or in o∣ther places of <HI>Europe,</HI> the whollest and least defaced either by iniurie of times, or rage of barbarous nations. Moreouer, a triumphall arche, in whose inscription this citie is termed COLONIA AVGVSTA VERONA NOVA GALLIE∣NIANA. There are also other monuments, which here for breuitie sake we must omit.</P>
<P>The liberties or ground belonging to this citie is in length, from the little towne <HI>Baruchello,</HI> vnto <HI>Riua</HI> (which is on the farther side of <HI>Lago de Garda</HI>) sixtie fiue miles: in bredth, which beginneth at <HI>La torre delle confine,</HI> vnto <HI>Riuoltella,</HI> for∣tie miles: and conteineth in all 1443378. fields (so the common people of <HI>Italie</HI> call the measure whereby they measure their lands, <HI>Seardeonius</HI> interpreteth it Akers) whereof 1223112. are fertile, 220266 are barren: which notwithstanding dayly (by the industry and diligence of the husbandmen) are made more fruitfull.</P>
<P>There is in this tract a very high mountaine (the Mappe placeth it betweene <HI>Lago de Gardo</HI> and the riuer <HI>Adese</HI>) which they call <HI>Baldo.</HI> This hill is very well knowen to Herborists and Apothecaries, which flocke hither from all quarters, and do gather many kindes of herbs and roots necessary in Physicke, and good and holesome for the vse of man.</P>
<P>There is also here in a certaine vale called <HI>Policella,</HI> a place named <HI>Negarina:</HI> where there is a very hard stone to be seene, hauing vpon it teats carued to the iust fashion and proportion of a womans breasts; out of the which pappes water doth continually distill and droppe; wherewith if a nurse or a woman giuing sucke doe wash her breasts dried vp by sicknesse or any other mischance, it pre∣sently draweth downe the milke againe. There are also other waters of this coun∣trey, giuen by the benefit of nature, both pleasant and profitable. But the studi∣ous Reader desirous to know more of this territory, let him reade <HI>Blondus</HI> and <HI>Le∣ander,</HI> he shall be, I dare boldly affirme, satisfied at the full. <HI>Torellus Sarayna</HI> hath written a whole booke of the antiquities, originall, gouernment and policy and famous men of the citie of <HI>Ʋerona.

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Eander</HI> in the description of <HI>Italie,</HI> (after a long discourse of the gouernment of this Duchie) maketh this relation of <HI>Millane</HI> his chiefe citie: The citie <HI>Millane,</HI> saith he, is so conueniently seated, that besides the great store of fruite which the ground of his territories do yeeld, out of <HI>Gallia Cisalpina</HI> or <HI>Lombardie,</HI> all things, aswell for plea∣sure and delight as for profit and necessarie vse in mans life, may be easily transpor∣ted thither. It is so great, that it may well compare with the greatest cities of all <HI>Europe.</HI> It hath very longe and large suburbes, by which it is greatly augmented some of them so huge, that they may contend for bignesse with other great cities of <HI>Italie.</HI> Notwithstanding of late yeares they suffered great wrecke, by reason of the mortall warres and continuall troubles betweene <HI>Charles</HI> the fift and the French and Venetians. By which they were by fire and sword almost vtterly ouerthrowne and destroied, although now by great diligence and industrie of the citizens they are reedified againe. Wide and deepe diches full of water do compasse both the citie and suburbes: by which on euery side by boate and barge such great store of prouision is brought vnto it, that there is not any thing heere which is not to be bought at a reasonable rate. It is very admi∣rable in my conceite, to record the great aboundance and plenty of all things necessary for the vse of man. So many there are and such diuerse sorts of Artificers here, and so great a concourse, as is wonder∣full and may scarcely be told: whereupon that common by-word of the vulgar sort did arise, <HI>He that would repaire all Italie, must first pull downe Millane:</HI> to wit, that by this meanes out of his holes and nests the swarmes of Artificers might be dispearsed into all quarters of <HI>Italie.</HI> The citie hath very stately and beau∣tifull buildings: especially the gorgeous and sumptuous edifice, which they call <HI>The house,</HI> reered with in∣finite charge, and such wonderfull workemanship, that there is but a very few Churches of the whole world that may be compared, vnto it, whether you respect the huge greatnesse, and ingenious Archite∣cture, or the price of the Marble and rare worke of the same: for that not onely euery way within and without it is beautifully trimmed and pargetted ouer with white marble, but also it is bedecked with a wonderfull imagery, wrought in Marble with exceeding cunning. Beside very many famous Chur∣ches and Chappels especially Grace church, and Praechers church, situate ouer against the most strong Castle of <HI>Porta Iouia:</HI> hauing an <HI>Hemisphere</HI> made by <HI>Lewis Sfortia</HI> the Duke of <HI>Millane:</HI> vnderneath the which hee together with his wife lie buried, enclosed in a tombe of the best marble. To this Church is adioy∣ned the stately Abbey of the Friers Predicant, with a goodly Librarie and a very faire Chamber or Hall trimmed about with the storie of the supper of Christ and his Apostles, an admirable peece of worke, done by the hand of <HI>Leonardo Vincio</HI> a Florentine sufficiently approuing the great skill and cunning of the ingenious workeman, by the iudgement of all men experienced in the Art of painting. There are very many gorgeous houses of priuate citizens euery where to be seene within the citie. The Castle of <HI>Porta Iouia,</HI> is the strongest and best contriued fortification in all Christendome, which hitherto could neuer be surprized and forcibly taken by any enemie. There are besides these very many excellent buildings in <HI>Millane,</HI> which heere I must passe ouer with silence. Thus farre <HI>Leander,</HI> who doth excellently describe the rest of the townes and places of his territories of this citie. See also <HI>Volateran</HI> in his Geography, <HI>Geor∣gius Merula, Bernard Arlun,</HI> and <HI>Bonauenture Castillion,</HI> who hath written a seuerall Treatise of the <HI>Insubres,</HI> of their auncients seats and antiquities. Moreouer <HI>Bernardine Corius</HI> hath written the Millane historie in the Italian tongue. <HI>Laonicus Chalcocondylas</HI> also speaketh something of the happy estate of this citie, and a∣mongst other things he doth excellently describe and set out the fable of the Dragon, which made this citie desolate in the time of the <HI>Mariangeli,</HI> from whence the armes and cognisance of this city were deui∣sed, as is very likely. But it will not be amisse to adioine to these the opinion of <HI>Procopius,</HI> who writeth that this city doth surpasse the city of <HI>Rome</HI> in greatnesse, multitude of citizens, and other great blessings of God.</P>
<P><HI>Liguria</HI> also, which in this Chart is wholly described, is bounded with the riuers <HI>Varo</HI> and <HI>Magra,</HI> the Apenine mountaines and the Ligusticke sea, (a branch of the Mediterranean sea) now called <HI>Leonino.</HI> This now they call <HI>Riuiera di Genoa,</HI> of <HI>Genua</HI> his chiefe citie. This citie long since had enlarged his domi∣nion vnto <HI>Tanais:</HI> for it had <HI>Theodosia</HI> (now called <HI>Caffa</HI>) vnder his subiection: as also the Isles of <HI>Cyprus, Lesbos,</HI> and <HI>Chios,</HI> with <HI>Pera</HI> the city of <HI>Thrace.</HI> At this day it hath the commaund of all <HI>Liguria</HI> and the Iland <HI>Corsica.</HI> It is a famous Mart towne, whose most valiant and stout citizens haue gotten to them∣selues, by merchandise and traffique almost into all parts of the world an honourable name and renown together with great riches and large possessions. <HI>Austen Iustinian</HI> Bishop of <HI>Nebia</HI> hath most curiously compiled in the mother tongue the historie of <HI>Genua:</HI> which also very lately <HI>Petro Pizaro,</HI> and <HI>Herberto Folietta</HI> haue done in the Latin tongue. Moreouer <HI>Francis Petrarch</HI> hath written something of this Citie in his holy Iournall and <HI>Laonicus</HI> in his 5. Booke.</P>

Yet <HI>Liuy</HI> and others do report it to haue beene reduced to a Colonie of the Romanes long before that time, to witte, about the yeare 536. after the building of <HI>Rome.</HI> This citie is placed in <HI>Gallia Cisalpina</HI> (now called <HI>Lombardie</HI>) amongst the Cenomans, as <HI>Ptolomey</HI> recordeth, or in the tenth prouince of <HI>Italie,</HI> as <HI>Plinie</HI> affirmeth, vpon the banke of the riuer <HI>Po.</HI> The soile of his liberties is Champion ground, very fertile of all maner of graine, as also of wine: other things which are necessarily required for the preseruation of mans life, are plentifully conueied thither by the benefit of the streame. It hath endured many bitter stormes of fortune hauing ben oft sacked and spoi∣led: First, in those furious warres of <HI>Marke Antonie,</HI> when as the territories of this citie, <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> being victor, were giuen vnto the souldiers. Then againe in the time of <HI>Vitellius,</HI> after the battell at <HI>Bebriacke,</HI> 40000. souldiers assaulted and sacked it: the com∣pany of freebooters, swaggerers, and base slaues was such, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> affirmeth that they regarded nothing whether it were profane or holy all was fish that came to net. Onely <HI>Mephitis templum</HI> standing without the walls, was vntoucht, whether by Gods proui∣dence or strength of the place I know not. Againe it was spoiled by the tyranous and ro∣guish Gothes and Vandalls, then by the barbarous Lombards about the yeare after Christ 630. Moreouer it abode the violent assault of <HI>Fredericke</HI> surnamed <HI>Aenobarbe,</HI> or <HI>Barbarosso,</HI> who beat downe his walls, and laide them leuell with the ground. After this the Ciuill warres betweene the Guelfs and Gibellines especially raged heere; in the yere, 1312. Lastly, vnder the gouernmēt of the vicounts of <HI>Millane,</HI> &amp; thā vnder his Duks, it began againe by little and little to sprout vp and recouer it selfe. Vnder these hitherto it hath prosperously and peaceably enioied the estate of a flourishing common-weale. This city hath a castle, aboue all other in <HI>Italie,</HI> most strong &amp; fearful to the enimy.

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Rema</HI> a towne in the confines of <HI>Millane,</HI> is a Castle &amp; place of garrison of the Venetians.

The Veneti∣ans haue often assaied to adorne the towne with the title of a city: but the citizens, fearing that whereas now it is accounted amongst the best townes, it shall then be reckoned amongst the meanest cities, haue hitherto with∣stood that their purpose. It is seated in a pleasāt plaine, in compasse large &amp; wide, fortified with a strong wall, fa∣mous for wealth, very populous, and abounding with all things necessary: for the soile of the territorie and li∣berties of this towne is very fertile, and yet by the great diligence and industrie of the husbandmen, it is dailie bettered and amended.

<HEAD>The liberties of BRESCIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He liberties of <HI>Brescia</HI> now possesseth part of that coast where in time passed the Cenomanes dwelt: and extendeth it selfe in length 800. furlongs, or 100. miles; in bredth 400. furlongs, or 50. miles, as <HI>Elias Capriolus</HI> affirmeth: it is situate betweene the lakes <HI>Garda</HI> and <HI>Iseo:</HI> the Alpes and the riuer <HI>Oglio.</HI> These fields, as <HI>Iohn Planer</HI> writeth, are worthily accounted amongst the most delightsome champions of <HI>Lombardie.</HI> For it hath, as <HI>Baptist Nazario</HI> saith, Gold, Siluer, Brasse, Lead, Iron, Alume, Marble, both Porphyrie and Serpentine, as they call it, barly coloured with blacke and greene, <HI>Plinie</HI> calleth it <HI>Ophites;</HI> and other stones of great price; as also the <HI>Marchasite,</HI> which aun∣ciently hath beene called <HI>Pyrites,</HI> or The fire stone.</P>
<P>The citie <HI>Brixia,</HI> whereof this territorie tooke his name; as yet reteineth the same his auncient name: for the inhabitants do call it <HI>Brescia,</HI> the which for his riches and beautie they terme in that common prouerbe of theirs, <HI>The Bride of the city of Venice.</HI> There is not any of the old writers, either Historians or Geogra∣phers, which do not make mention of this city. <HI>Trogus Pompeius</HI> writeth that it was built by the <HI>Galli Senones. Liuy</HI> saith, that it is the chiefe city of the Cenomanes. <HI>Pliny</HI> in his Epistles of this writeth thus vnto <HI>Iunius Mauricus, Brixia</HI> is that city which con∣stantly retaineth as yet much of that graue modesty and old frugalitie of our auncient Italians. It hath beene graced with the title of a Duchie, for so I find written in <HI>Diaconus</HI> his 5. booke of <HI>Lombardie</HI> in the 36. Chapter. But because that none of the late writers, (that I may say nought of the more ancient) haue described this citie more learnedly and eloquently, than <HI>Pighius</HI> in his <HI>Hercules Prodicius,</HI> thou shalt heare him speake in his owne termes. <HI>Brescia</HI> which is seated at the foot of the mountaines, may contend with most of the cities of <HI>Italie,</HI> for antiquitie and statelinesse of buildings, <HI>Iulius Caesar Scaliger,</HI> a famous Poet of our age, hath thus described it in this Epigramme; <HI>Thou</HI> Brixia <HI>great which proudly ouerlook'st the boornes and lowlie plaine, by due desert now iustlie mayst the soueraigne Empire claime. Thy healthfull seat, thy pleasant fertile soile, thy people wise and nation stout, If ciuill discord had not crosst, long since had brought about, That where long time thou hast beene thrall, and stoop'st to others lore; Thou mightest haue lorded ouer those, to whom thou serud'st before.</HI> For this Citie by reason of ciuill discord and dissention, being subdued vnder the yoke of the French and their next neighbours the Insubres, or the Millaners, hath endured much miserie: yet now at length, vnder the peaceable gouernment of the Venetians, it is growen ve∣ry wealthy, a great market well furnished with all things necessary, very populous and inhabited of a wise and discreet nation. The shire is very fertile of oile, wine, corne, and most excellent fruites of all sorts. It hath also some rich veines of Mettalls, but especially of Iron and Copper; whereof ariseth to this citie great gaine and commodity. <HI>Liuie</HI> and other good authors report, That <HI>Brescia</HI> was built by the <HI>Galli Cenomanes,</HI> about the time of the Romane kings, which afterward the Romanes, hauing subdued all that part of the countrey of the <HI>Gaules</HI> which lieth beyond the riuer <HI>Po,</HI> reduced vnder their iurisdiction. It is ap∣parant out of <HI>Liuie,</HI> how firme it sometimes stood with the Romans, especially in those most dangerous warres between them and <HI>Hanniball.</HI> Some would haue it to haue beene made a Colonie present after the end of the League-warre, when as <HI>Cneius Pompeius Strabo,</HI> the father of <HI>Pompey</HI> the great, planted colonies in <HI>Verona</HI> and other cities beyond the riuer <HI>Po.</HI> Not long after, by the fauour of <HI>C. Caesar,</HI> it together with other cities there about, obtained the freedome of the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> and after that it is woonderfull how it flourished vnder the Roman Emperours, so long as the greatnesse of that Empire stood vnshaken: This, diuers monuments of Antiquitie, which as yet remaine in this city and in the liberties of the same: as namely many goodly inscriptions of marble, statues, pillars, and Epitaphes of famous men, do constantly auerre, by which the former great∣nesse of this city may easily be gathered. Thus farre <HI>Pighius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Baptista Nazario</HI> wrote a seuerall Treatise of this city, in the which he setteth downe all the inscriptions of the auncient monuments of this country. <HI>Helias Capriolus</HI> hath comprized the whole historie of this citie in 12. bookes. <HI>Gaudentius Me∣rula,</HI> in his tract of the originall and antiquitie of the Cisalpines, speaketh somewhat of it, as also <HI>Chrysostomus Zanchus,</HI> writing of the originall of the <HI>Orobij</HI> and <HI>Cenomanes,</HI> likewise <HI>Leander Albertus</HI> and lately <HI>Andrete Paccius</HI> in his sixth booke of the Wines of <HI>Italie.</HI> There is in this prouince a towne called <HI>Quintianum,</HI> 20. miles south-eastward from <HI>Brescia,</HI> neere to the riuer <HI>Ollio,</HI> of the which <HI>Iohn Planer</HI> a citizen of the same wrote a small Treatise, who in an Epistle of his to <HI>Paullus Manutius,</HI> doth highly commend it both for learning and chiualrie. Whether this be that <HI>Quintianum,</HI> of which <HI>Optatus</HI> after speaketh, I leaue to the learned to determine.</P>
<P>The riuer <HI>Mela</HI> or <HI>Mella;</HI> of which <HI>Virgil</HI> maketh mention, doth runne through the middest of this shire; as also <HI>Catullus</HI> in this verse affirmeth, <HI>Brixia Cygnaea positus in specula, Flauus quam molli percurrit flumine Mella.</HI> Old <HI>Brixia</HI> plac'd amidde the brookes, as gardian of the Swans, The riuer <HI>Mella</HI> kindly greet'th, and watereth all his lands. This riuer retaineth the name of <HI>Mella</HI> vnto this day. Notwithstanding it runneth not by it now, as you may see, although not farre off from thence it passeth through his liberties. The little riuer which runneth along by the city, is now called <HI>Garza:</HI> but I thinke that in old time it was also called <HI>Mella.</HI> And I thinke I may truly affirme, that the riuer <HI>Mella,</HI> when it approacheth neere vnto the city, spreadeth it selfe into two channells, both of them retaining the same name, do make a riuer-iland, (like as <HI>Nilus</HI> maketh <HI>Heracleopolites,</HI>) and then againe falling into one streame still keepe the name of <HI>Mella,</HI> and hauing so, heauily laden, runne for many miles toge∣ther, at length it vnladeth it selfe into the riuer <HI>Ollio.</HI></P>
<P>But before I finish the discourse of this Mappe, I haue thought good to say somewhat of the Lakes of the same. The lake <HI>Benacus</HI> (called of the poet <HI>Catullus, Lydius) Capriolus</HI> thinketh to haue been so named of the city <HI>Benaco,</HI> sometime seated vpon his brinke, a mention of which to this day remaineth still in a village called <HI>Toscolano,</HI> which thou seest vpon his west side, stan∣ding vpon a brooke of the same name. A memoriall of this city is preserued in an auncient monument, whose inscription <HI>Ma∣nutius</HI> setteth downe in his Orthographie. This lake is now called <HI>Garda,</HI> of the castle <HI>Garda</HI> placed opposite vnto <HI>Benaco</HI> vpon his east banke. This lake, as <HI>Alexius Vgonius</HI> writeth in a letter of his to <HI>Cardinall Poole,</HI> aboundeth with store of fish, which for goodnesse do far surpasse all others. It is enclosed on euery side with most pleasant hilles: into it from all quarters the cleare fountaines flow. Goodly meddowes, vines, oliues, beeches, laurell, and cedars; besides townes, furnished with all maner of necessarie prouision, like a crowne beset it round on euery side: so that nothing at all of those things may further be desired, which may make a champion country either beautifull to the eie, or commendable for profit and commodities &amp;c. While I was writing of this, there came into my mind what speech I once had of this lake, with that most learned good man <HI>Benedi∣ctus Arias Montanus,</HI> (for we both had seene the same, although not at the same time) in which we both did protest either to other, that we neuer in all our liues had seene a place either more pleasant for situation, or more delightsome to the eie, so that it was no maruell that <HI>Catullus</HI> did so highly commend in his Epigrammes, that his <HI>Sirmion,</HI> and the waters of this lake. The other lake in this Cart is <HI>Sebinus</HI> or <HI>Seuinnus</HI> (for <HI>Plinie</HI> vseth both) made by the riuer <HI>Ollio.</HI> This now they call <HI>Iseo,</HI> of a town of the same name situate vpon his banke. There is also another lake which they call <HI>Idro;</HI> by what name it was called of the auncients, or whether by any, I doe not certainly know. I know, that a certaine learned man doth hold it to be <HI>Brigantinus La∣cus,</HI> whereof <HI>Plinie</HI> speaketh; but why I am not of his opinion, I haue shewed reasons in my Geographicall treasure.</P>

The bounds of this country are thus: on the East, the riuer <HI>Po:</HI> on the South, the Alpes of <HI>Liguria:</HI> vpon the West, the Alpes of <HI>France:</HI> on the North, <HI>Riuiera di Duria:</HI> It hath many good∣ly fields full of pleasant and fruitfull hilles, which yeeld corne and o∣ther sorts of graine, excellent wines and fruite great store.

<P>Vnder the gouernment of the Lombardes it was called, The Dukedome of <HI>Taurine,</HI> (so named of the city <HI>Taurin.</HI>) By them it was first reduced into the forme of a prouince, vnder the iurisdiction of a Duke. The gouernment of the Lombardes being come vnto a period, it was made subiect to the Kings of <HI>Italie,</HI> who were alwaies chosen by the Emperours: after that it was gouerned by diuers Petie Kings: and long since, in later ages it was accounted as part of the iurisdiction of the Princes, Earles, and Dukes of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> vntill the yeare 1536. when as <HI>Francis</HI> the first King of <HI>France</HI> tooke a great part of it: and now it is againe restored to the Duke of <HI>Sauoy.</HI> The chiefe city of this Prouince is <HI>Turin,</HI> seated at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Dorra,</HI> where it falleth into <HI>Po.</HI> This citie <HI>Ptolemey, Plinie</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> call <HI>Augusta Taurinorum.</HI> That this citie in old time was a very famous citie, it may easily appeare, in that it was a colonie of the Romanes. It lieth at the foot of the mountaines, it is foure square, and hath foure goodly gates. It is very famous for the rich Isle and state of the citizens, and is adorned with many goodly buildings, amongst the which the Cathe∣drall Church is most beautifull. It hath an Vniuersitie of all maner of goodly learning: and is very well serued with all sorts of prouision of victuall. The countrie is of a very good and fertile soile, especially toward the East and South, hauing Vallies most rich for veines of Iron. <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> affirmeth that <HI>Taurin</HI> was the seat of the Lombardes: vnto whom it was subiect vntill <HI>Desiderius</HI> their king was ouercome and taken by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great: and then it was brought vnder the sub∣iection of the Kings of <HI>Italie,</HI> Emperours, Countes, Montferrate and Marchions, and Dukes of <HI>Sauoy;</HI> to whom at this time it is obedient. Neere the head of the riuer <HI>Po</HI> toward <HI>Ripell</HI> (or <HI>C. de Reuell</HI>) and <HI>Paisana,</HI> are quarries of most excellent Marble.</P>
<P>Vpon the North side of the fountaine of the riuer <HI>Po,</HI> beginneth a certaine pleasant valley cal∣led the Vale of <HI>Po,</HI> or (as the inhabitants terme it) the Vale of <HI>Luserna,</HI> of the towne <HI>Luserna</HI> which standeth in it. It runneth out in length thirtie miles, and is not aboue foure miles broad. In the entrance of his Eastend, is <HI>Mambrinum;</HI> in the end toward the West is a very high stone crosse. The people of this place are commonly called, <HI>The Christians,</HI> but in some maners and customes which they vse, they scarse follow the strickt rules of Christianity: nay they do obserue most vngodly and wicked rites and ceremonies: amongst which this is one; That once in a moneth they obserue one day, in the which all meeting in a Church, after a collation made by their filthie and wicked Superintendent, at night, the Candles being put out; without any choice or regard, they fall like bruite beastes vnto their beastly Venerie. This we haue taken out of <HI>Leander,</HI> where thou maist read, if thou pleasest, many other such like things. <HI>Dominicus Niger</HI> also hath written of this Country.</P>

<P>Thou seest also in this Chart the description of <HI>Montferrate,</HI> which at this day is vnder the domi∣nion of the Dukes of <HI>Mantua:</HI> of the which <HI>Blondus</HI> thus writeth: At the riuer <HI>Taner</HI> the famous Countie of <HI>Montferrate</HI> beginneth, whose boundes are the riuer <HI>Po,</HI> on this side: and the Mount <HI>Appennine,</HI> on that side: the riuer <HI>Taner</HI> from his fountaine vnto his mouth where it falleth into <HI>Po,</HI> and on his vpper side the hilles next to <HI>Moncalerio,</HI> where <HI>Piemont</HI> beginneth.

It hath a goodly large common without the citie, wherein the enemie that will besiege it, shall not find a place to shrowd himselfe: A Session-house (the Yeeld hall, we call it) most stately and sumptuous all couered ouer with lead: An vniuersitie most famous of all <HI>Europe,</HI> begunne, as they report, by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, finished by <HI>Fredericke</HI> the eleuenth, in the yeare of our Lord 1222. and fortie yeares after that confirmed by <HI>Vrbane</HI> the fourth Bishop of <HI>Rome.</HI> There is in this citie an Orchard (which they call the <HI>Physicians Garden</HI>) in forme round and verie large, planted with all maner of strange herbs vsuall in Physicke, for the instruction of yong students in the knowledge of Herbs and Plants; a singular and worthy worke. Clothing is the chiefe trade of the Citizens, a matter of 600000. pounds returne yearely and more.

Many little brookes runne through the towne, which is compassed with a strong wall, and is very populous; it is beautified with many stately buildings, both Churches, and priuate houses. The country adioining to <HI>Treuiso</HI> is most pleasant and rich, yeelding all maner of things necessarie to the vse of man and beast: For in it is a very large plaine, yeelding not onely great store of all sorts of graine, and excellent wines, but also it hath many goodly pastures, feeding abundance of cattell. Neither are his mountaines altogether craggie and barren. But his lower hilles are set with vines, oliues, and other fruit-trees, and affoord plenty of Deere, pastime for the hunter.

The city it selfe for walles, castle and water is very strong; for bridges, priuate houses, and Churches, very beautifull; and for diuers merchandise very famous. It hath great store of corne, wine, oile, fish, and fruites. The country hath very many castles and villages: but worthy men commended for Religion and wisedome, vertuous life and ciuill conuersation, do especially commend this city.

It is a most goodly, beautifull and pleasant country. The people are very ingenious and of a subtile witte, indifferently fitte either for peace or warre: for all maner of humane litterature, or for trades and merchandise. The nation hath alwaies been superstitious and much giuen to deuotion in religion, as is apparant out of ancient writers. The sea coast toward the <HI>Tyrrhen</HI> or Mediterran sea, is for the most part in this our age full of Forrests, as also it was in the time of <HI>Vopiscus,</HI> as he witnesseth in the life of <HI>Aurelian;</HI> especially a little beyond the riuer <HI>Arno,</HI> vntill one come beyond <HI>Plumbino.</HI> The inner part of the country is almost as much oppressed with Mountaines.</P>
<P>In it are these cities, more famous than the rest, <HI>Florence, Siena, Luca, Perugia, Pisa, Viterbo,</HI> &amp;c. FLORENCE, or as they call it <HI>Fiorenza,</HI> is situate vpon ech side of the riuer <HI>Arno,</HI> conioined by foure faire bridges: it is a most goodly and beautifull city, whereupon commonly they call it <HI>Fiorenza la bella, Florence</HI> the faire: as if indeed it might seeme to bee the flower of all <HI>Italie.</HI> For it is adorned with stately buildings, aswell Churches and religi∣ous houses, as of priuate citizens. Amongst all other the Church of <HI>S. Maria Florida,</HI> wholly ouerlaid with Mar∣ble, arched with a roofe of an admirable workemanship, neere to which is built a goodly steeple for the bels, all of fine marble: not farre from which standeth the ancient Temple of <HI>Mars,</HI> of forme round very ingeniously built, and of a cunning workemanship, now dedicated to <HI>S. Iohn Baptist.</HI> The dores of this Church are of cast brasse; a very rare and curious peece of worke: especially those which are next to the Church of <HI>S. Maria Florida,</HI> are such that all men of iudgement and experience must absolutely confesse that in all <HI>Europe</HI> beside, the like are no where to be seene. But to reckon vp all the worthy buildings of this citie, aswell sacred as profane it were too tedious and would require more paper than this our purposed discourse will beare; He therefore that desireth to know more of the particulers more at large, let him reade <HI>Leander.</HI></P>
<P>SIENA lieth vpon the top of an hill, round begirt with high rocks of Tophus-stone, gorgeously bedecked with many noble mens houses: amongst the which is the great and large Church of our Lady, equall to the stateliest and sumptuousest Churches of all <HI>Europe;</HI> whether you respect the worth and price of the Marble whereof it is built: or the excellencie of the worke and workemanship of him that made it. Besides that there is a most stately house of tree stone built by Pope <HI>Pius</HI> II. with many other goodly houses. Worthy of commen∣dation and record is the large and beautifull market place, with <HI>Branda</HI> the pleasant fountaine alwaies full of most cleare water.</P>
<P>PERVGIA is seated vpon the mountaine Apennine, the greatest part of the countrie arising with goodly pleasant hilles, fertile of strong Wines, Oiles, Figges, Apples, and other sorts of most excellent fruits. Beneath the citie at <HI>Asisia,</HI> as also toward <HI>Tuder,</HI> neere <HI>Tiber,</HI> the pleasant champion fields do spread themselues, yeelding plenty of wheat and other kind of graine. The city by reason of the nature of the place is very strong, adorned with gorgeous buildings both of religious houses and churches as also priuate citizens: together with a famous and large fountaine in the middest of the citie. It is very populous and the citizens are very ingenious and of couragious stomackes, apt indifferently either for any maner litterature or for seruice in the field.</P>
<P>PISA, long since hath beene a famous citie and many waies richly blessed, not onely before the flourishing estate of the Roman Empire, but euen when it was at the full height: as also many yeares after. Many famous Marine-conquests, which it hath made, by which it brought the Ile <HI>Sardinia</HI> subiect to their command, do a∣uouch this to be true. <HI>Panormo</HI> a faire citie of <HI>Sicilia</HI> they won from the Saracens: and of the bootie and spoiles taken in that warre, they began to build the great Church, which they call DOMNVM, as also the beautifull palace of the Bishop. It hath an Vniuersitie or Schoole of all maner of Liberall Arts and Sciences, whose foun∣dation was laid in the yeare of CHRIST 1309.</P>
<P>VITERBO lieth in a pleasant and spacious champion hauing the Cyminian hilles (now of this citie called <HI>Mont Viterbo</HI>) vpon his backeside, stately for many faire buildings and works of rare Art, amongst which is a fa∣mous fountaine, from whence issueth water in such abundance as is wonderfull.</P>
<P>LVCA is seated in a plaine, not farre from the hilles foot, a city of goodly buildings.

<HEAD>The Signiory of FLORENCE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F the city of <HI>Florence</HI> read <HI>Blondus,</HI> who in his view of <HI>Italie</HI> reporteth thus of it: They commonly af∣firme, saith he, that this citie was first begonne by <HI>Sylla's</HI> souldiers, vnto whom this part of the countrie was by <HI>Sylla</HI> assigned: and because they first began to seat themselues <HI>ad Arna fluenta,</HI> about the riuer <HI>Arno,</HI> they then intituled it by the name of FLVENTIA. And indeed <HI>Pliny,</HI> who of all the old writers first mentioneth this place, saith that the <HI>Fluentini</HI> were seated neere the riuer <HI>Arno.</HI> These souldiers came hither about the yeare after the building of the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> 667. whereupon it appeareth that <HI>Florence</HI> was founded about 83. yeares before the birth of Christ. This city suffered much wrecke in the time of the warres of the Gothes. Yet was it neuer, either by <HI>Totilas,</HI> or any other of those ragings Tyrants, vtter∣ly rased or spoiled: And therefore that which some do write of the repairing of <HI>Florence</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, I can by no meanes allow when as the histories of <HI>Charles</HI> written by <HI>Alcuinus</HI> his schoolemaster, do only mention his keeping of Easter heere at two seuerall times, as he went by this way toward <HI>Rome.</HI> It was preserued from a great hazard of vtter ouerthrow, which it was like to haue fallen into, by the manhood of one <HI>Farinata Vber∣tino,</HI> when as they of <HI>Pisa, Siena,</HI> and others of <HI>Tuscane,</HI> meeting at a market in a consultation by them held, hauing generally deter∣mined to rase <HI>Florence</HI> to the ground, said stoutly: That while he liued, he would neuer suffer his deare Mother, which brought him vp, by them to be spoiled. Therefore <HI>Florence</HI> partly taking by force, and partly by other meanes drawing to their part the Fesulanes, about the yeare of Christ, 1024. was much enlarged in wealth and authoritie: at which time also <HI>Henry</HI> the first Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> built the goodly Church of S. <HI>Miniate</HI> neere the walles of <HI>Florence.</HI> This city was twise within a little while, in the yeare 1176. mise∣rably defaced, by casualty of fire. From which time it first began to be gouerned as now it is by the <HI>Priori,</HI> (the masters of the twelue companies) and a Standard-bearer, <HI>Gonfalonerio,</HI> they call him. One of the first Gonfalonerios was <HI>Stroza,</HI> a nobleman borne, of a great house. The goodly <HI>Minster</HI> which in our time, by the ingenious direction of <HI>Philippo Brunalitio,</HI> a Florentine, was most stately arched, and dedicated to our Lady, was begun in the yeare of our Lord 1294. Foure yeares after that was that gorgeous Palace, where now the <HI>Priori,</HI> or Aldermen do keepe, first founded. And fiue yeares after that was the <HI>Pomoerium,</HI> (the prospect, or wast ground, round about the city) leuelled and the walles of the city enlarged. <HI>Pistorio</HI> was the first city that the Florentines subdued vnder their command, as <HI>Leander,</HI> in his description of <HI>Italie,</HI> affirmeth vpon the testimony of <HI>Aretino:</HI> where also he hath these words, of the diuers forms and different maner of gouernment of the same; After that it was repaired, saith he, by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, they yearely chose two Consuls or Sheriffes, who with the assistance of 100. Senatours or Aldermen, should gouerne the city. This forme of com∣monwealth being altered, they created the <HI>Decemuiri,</HI> the tenne, called of them <HI>Antiani,</HI> about the yeare of Grace, 1220. as <HI>Volaterran</HI> affirmeth, or as <HI>Blondus</HI> saith in the yeare 1254. After that in the yeare 1287. hauing redeemed their freedome of the Emperour <HI>Ru∣dolfe</HI> for 60000. crownes, as <HI>Platina</HI> writeth, the <HI>Decemuiri,</HI> (the tenne) were reduced to <HI>Octouiri,</HI> (eight) and were called the <HI>Priori,</HI> (the maisters of the companies) ouer whom was set the Standerd-bearer, called by them <HI>Gonfalonerio di Giustitia,</HI> the Lord chiefe Iu∣stice; which office they were to hold but two monethes, and then others were to be elected. This forme of policy, for as much as I can gather out of historiographers, was since that time thrise altered. First in the yeare 1343. when the Florentines bought <HI>Luca</HI> of <HI>Mastino Scaligero</HI> for 5000. crownes; their forces being ouerthrowne by the enemie, they were constrained to demand aid of <HI>Robert</HI> King of Naples, and obtained <HI>Gualterio Gallo</HI> a captaine of <HI>Athens</HI> for their generall, who by great subtilty and cunning getting the rule of the city, went to the Court and there deposed the <HI>Priori,</HI> and other Magistrates from their office. Yet he enioied not his vsurped authority long, for the people at the persuasion of <HI>Angelo Accieuolo</HI> Bishop of the sea a Frier predicant, rose vp in armes, and deposing the Tyrant, restored the <HI>Priori</HI> and <HI>Confalonerio</HI> to their places againe. The second alteration of this Common-wealth happened in the time of <HI>Alexander</HI> the sixth Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> when as his sonne <HI>Caesar Borgia,</HI> Duke of <HI>Valence,</HI> (neuer labouring to bring home a∣gaine <HI>Peter, Iohn</HI> and <HI>Iulian,</HI> the sonnes of <HI>Laurence Medices,</HI> who but lately had beene banished) at length brought the matter so a∣bout that the office of the <HI>Gonfalonerio</HI> should be giuen to <HI>Peter Soderine</HI> for a perpetuall and standing office: who together with the <HI>Priori</HI> chosen euery two moneths, after the ancient custome, most wisely behaued himselfe and orderly gouerned that Common∣wealth: vntill at length being expelled by <HI>Raimundo Cordona</HI> Embassadour of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the King of <HI>Arragon</HI> and Naples, (who was to restore <HI>Iohn Cardinall Medices,</HI> and his brother <HI>Iulian,</HI>) in the yeare of Grace 1412. and erecting the ancient maner of gouernment, which continued vntill the yeare 1530. In the meane time, although the city were commanded, at the discretion and direction of the Popes <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, (which was <HI>Iohn Medices,</HI>) and <HI>Clement</HI> the seuenth, (which was <HI>Iulius Medices</HI>) the bastard sonne of <HI>Iulian,</HI> the first Cardinall <HI>Cortonesse,</HI> hauing the wardship, and being Gardian to <HI>Hippolytus</HI> the sonne of <HI>Iulian</HI> the second) &amp; of <HI>Alexander,</HI> the bastard sonne of <HI>Laurenznio,</HI> the nephew of <HI>Peter</HI> the second. Yet notwithstanding the ancient Magistrates were chosen after the cu∣stome formerly vsed. In that same yeare therefore, when as three yeares before, the Emperours souldiers besieging <HI>Clement</HI> the se∣uenth in <HI>Hadrians</HI> castle, the city shaking off the yoke of bondage, obteined freedome, and endeuoured by all meanes to retaine the same, <HI>Philip</HI> the Prince of <HI>Aurange</HI> leading the armie of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth. <HI>Clement</HI> entreating that <HI>Alexander</HI> his ne∣phew, whom before he had intituled Duke of <HI>Penna,</HI> to be brought againe into the city, forced it being much distressed for want of vi∣ctuall to yeeld to the obedience of the Emperour. <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour at the request of <HI>Clement</HI> the Pope presently created <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> perpetuall Priour: and thus the offices of the <HI>Priori</HI> and <HI>Gonfalonerio</HI> were vtterly taken away. Then, when the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> had created <HI>Alexander</HI> Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> and giuen vnto him in mariage <HI>Margaret</HI> his bastard daughter, in the yeare of our Sauiour, 1535. and two yeares after that, before the seuenth day of Ianuarie, <HI>Laurence Medices,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Peter Francis,</HI> that he might set his natiue country at liberty, as he pretended, had miserably slaine him. <HI>Cosmus Medices</HI> the sonne of <HI>Iohn Medices</HI> was created Duke in his roome. Thus farre <HI>Leander,</HI> vnto which I may adioine these words of my kind friend M. <HI>Iohn Pinadello:</HI> When it was known saith he, to <HI>Pius</HI> the fifth Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Cosmus Medices,</HI> Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> had at that time taken great paines for the maintai∣nance of the Church and Religion, and spared no cost in the warres against the hereticks, in the yeare 1570. in the moneth of Febru∣arie comming to the city, crowned him in <HI>Aula Regia,</HI> the Kings hall (a place in <HI>Vaticana</HI> so named) and gaue him and his successours, the title of, The great Duke. In whose Crowne the Pope caused these words to be engrauen, PIVS QVINTVS <HI>Pont. Max. ob exi∣miam dilectionem, &amp; Catholicae religionis zelum, praecipuum{que} iustitiae studium donauit.</HI> that is, Pius <HI>the fifth Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>in token of great loue, earnest zeale of Catholique religion, and constant maintainance of true Iustice gaue this.</HI> Thus farre in few words of the Offices, Policy and Iurisdiction of this city.</P>
<P>I thinke it not amisse here to adioine another short discourse, because it is rare, and not altogether from the purpose: It is thus as <HI>Syffridus Presbyter</HI> reporteth in <HI>George Fabricius</HI> his historie of <HI>Misnia. Otho</HI> the third Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> lying at <HI>Mutina</HI> with his wife, the Empresse fell in loue with a certaine Earle: but when as he by no meanes would consent vnto her, she so diffamed him vnto her husband, the Emperour, that he commanded him to be beheaded before euer he had examined the matter. Who before he was beheaded, entreated his wife, that after his death by the triall of Hoate Iron, she would approue to the view of the world, how wrongfully he was put to death. The day came, when as the Emperour sate to heare the causes and complaints of widdowes and Or∣phanes. Together with these came the late Countesse, bringing in her hand the Earles head: and demandeth what death that Iudge is worthy of, that had put a man to death wrongfully? The Emperour answered, He is worthy to lose his head. She saith, Thou art the same man, who at the false suggestion of thy wife didst vniustly cause my husband to be beheaded. The which when as the widdow approued vnto him by the maner of triall by hoat iron, the Emperour yeelded himselfe into the hands of the widdow, willing to abide his deserued punishment. Notwithstanding by the mediation of the Bishop and the Nobility, he obtained of the Countesse respite for tenne daies, then for eight, then for seuen, lastly for six. After the end of which daies, the Emperour hauing examined the matter, and being assured of the truth, gaue sentence against his wife, that she should be burned at a stake, and giuing foure castles vnto the widdow, redeemed his life. These castles are in the Bishopricke of <HI>Luna</HI> in <HI>Hetruria</HI> or <HI>Tuscane,</HI> and they are called after the names of the daies of repreeue, The tenth, The eighth, The seuenth, and The sixth. Thus farre <HI>Syffridus,</HI> which I thought good to set down in this place, for to my knowledge no man els hath left any record of these castles: neither are they named in this Mappe by our Au∣thour, notwithstanding that he hath described the country most curiously.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Ohannes Campanus</HI> writing of this country, affirmeth that although he had trauai∣led and viewed many countries, yet he neuer saw in all his life a more pleasant country, and better manured then the country of <HI>Perugia.</HI> All things seeme wast and wild to those that are farre off, but if you shall come more neere, nothing may be found more glorious either in respect of the husbandry of the land, or wholesomnesse of the aire, or fertility of the soile. The riuer of <HI>Tiber</HI> runneth through the middest of this country, and kindly watereth the same. Not farre from which is the city <HI>Perugia,</HI> situate vpon the Mount <HI>Apennine,</HI> built long since (as <HI>Trogus Pompeius</HI> affirmeth) by the Achaians; and of the twelue cities of <HI>Hetruria</HI> it is the chiefe. It was called <HI>Augusta</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Augustus,</HI> as the Capitall letters halfe a yeard square, grauen vpon the gate, do declare. This city, in regard of the nature of the place, is inuincible, richly beautified both with religious and priuate buildings of great state, and is very populous. This city aboue all the cities of <HI>Italie</HI> hath been euermore most fortunate and happie, hauing retained the same state and gouernment little or nothing altered, which it enioied before the building of <HI>Rome;</HI> and that which afterward it had, (in the time when <HI>Rome</HI> was ruled by Kings, Consuls, Emperours and Tyrants) at this time it reteineth. Yet it hath endured many and diuers greeuous and bitter storms. For in the time when <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> was Consull, as <HI>Liuie</HI> reporteth, 4500. of his citizens were slaine. In the daies of the <HI>Triumuiri, Augustus</HI> besiedged it, and forced it to great distresse for want of victualls, tooke it and rased it to the ground, and was wholly defaced with fire, except only the Temple of <HI>Vulcane,</HI> as <HI>Appian</HI> recordeth. Afterward it endured the seuen yeares siedge and batterie of the cruell Tyrant <HI>Totilas,</HI> and at length was sacked and spoiled &amp;c. Now it is subiect to the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and hath a famous Vniuersitie, which was erected about the yeare of CHRIST, 1290. as <HI>Middendorpius</HI> hath written. Heere in the time of our grand∣fathers, flourished the most renowmed Ciuilians, <HI>Bartholus</HI> and <HI>Baldus.</HI></P>
<P>In the precincts of this city is <HI>Lago di Perugia,</HI> the lake of <HI>Perugia,</HI> anciently called LACVS TRA∣SVMENVS, famous long since for a great ouerthrow heere giuen by <HI>Hanniball</HI> to the Romanes; <HI>Appianus</HI> calleth it <HI>Lacus Plestinus,</HI> but for what reason I know not. It is in compasse, as the foresaid <HI>Cam∣panus</HI> writeth, about thirtie miles. The water of it is very cleare and pure, there are no riuers which runne into it, neither hath it any issue forth, yet is his water so exceeding sweet, that any man would thinke it were fedde from some running fountaine. It hath in it three Isles, whereof two, which are to∣ward the North, are close together; the one called the Greater, the other the Lesser: (<HI>Maiores</HI> and <HI>Mi∣nores</HI>) This is wast and not in habited, only it hath a Church situate vpon the toppe of an hill. The other, which is neere to the liberties of <HI>Cortona,</HI> conteineth about 200. families. The third, which is toward the South, and is bigger then the other two, is very populous and well inhabited. The inhabitants almost giue themselues wholly to Fishing; they sow little Corne: yet they do not neglect to plant vines. For wood, fuell and fodder they go out into the fields and woods neere adioining. Amongst the records of <HI>Lewis</HI> first Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> there is mention of these three Ilands, where he nameth them MAIOR MINOR and PVLVENSIS, (now <HI>Polueso</HI>) where I perceiue that they yet retaine their ancient names. No boggs, fennes, or spuing meeres do impech the shore: this is full of Oliue gardens, which vpon the hills on euery side do adorne the Lake, and are for their wonderfull fertility very beautifull. In the plaine which is between the Lake and the Hilles, there is such abundance of Hempe and Flax, so that in all <HI>Hetruria</HI> or <HI>Tuscane,</HI> there is not more. No country yeldeth better Wines or sweeter Apples. The kinds of Fishes in the lake are not many, but the abundance is wonderfull; in which it farre excelleth all other Lakes of <HI>Italie:</HI> heere also the fishing continueth all the yeare long, yea euen in the dead of winter, which no other Lake in all <HI>Italie</HI> affoordeth. These fish in the winter are caried into <HI>Tuscane, Vmbria,</HI> and <HI>Picenta:</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> also they driue much cattell daily to be sold. The same <HI>Campanus</HI> affirmeth, that heere they take a pickerell partly coloured, spotted with diuers green specks, of the which he reporteth strange wonders: namely, that it doth engender with serpents, and from thence it getteth those strange colours. (The common people, saith <HI>Iacobus Greumus,</HI> in the twentieth chapter of his first booke, verily be∣leeueth that lampreies do engender with serpents, which <HI>Plinie</HI> holdeth for a fable, notwithstanding that hee often seemeth to be much delighted in writing of fables. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> also writeth, out of the re∣port of one <HI>Andreas,</HI> that these Lampreies which are bred of the viper, if they bite, the wound is deadly, which opinion he afterward reclaimeth as false.) Againe he telleth of a Pike that lying vpon the drie land, which when a fox assaied to catch, one of his feetstooke fast in his teeth; and both were found dead. <HI>Plinie</HI> in his second booke, chap. 107. testifieth that once this whole Lake did burne.</P>

<HEAD>The territories of the city of SIENA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Aesar Orlandius</HI> a famous Ciuillian of <HI>Siena,</HI> sent from <HI>Rome</HI> this Mappe, together with a briefe history of the city, taken out of a larger worke of his, (as he confesseth in his priuate letters to me, written of the originall of the same, to be inser∣ted into this our Theater of the World.</P>
<P>The city of <HI>Siena,</HI> saith he, is so ancient, that of his first beginning there is nothing to be found in any approued old wri∣ters. For that some do report it to haue beene built by the <HI>Galli Senones,</HI> which vnder the conduct of <HI>Breanus</HI> their ge∣nerall, about 363. yeares after the building of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the space of seuen moneths (as <HI>Polybius</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> haue recor∣ded) wan the city, it cannot be proued out of any good authour. For <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> which first broached this opinion, (who for that he intituled his history by the name of <HI>Polycraticon,</HI> is therefore called <HI>Polycrates,</HI> or of others <HI>Polycarpus,</HI>) in the seuenteenth chapter of his sixth booke, bringeth no authority for this his assertion. And himselfe confesseth in the twenty and fourth chapter of his eighth booke, that he was not familiarly known to Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> the fourth. Now it is apparant to all the world that <HI>Adrian</HI> the fourth sate in the Papall seat, but from the yeare of Christ, 1154. vnto the yeare 1159. and therefore the testimony of <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Salesbury,</HI> concerning the building of <HI>Siena,</HI> so many yeares before he was borne, is of no validity at all.</P>
<P><HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> in his twentieth booke of his Annales, calleth this city <HI>Colonia Senensis.</HI> Which words of his can by no meanes be vnderstood of the other <HI>Sena,</HI> (which at this day also is in the country <HI>Piceno,</HI> and is vulgarly called <HI>Senegallia,</HI>) as some haue fondly imagined. For in the time of <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> that city of <HI>Piceno,</HI> was not euer called <HI>Sena,</HI> but <HI>Senogallia,</HI> or <HI>Senogallica,</HI> or <HI>Senogallia,</HI> as is most manifest out of the words of <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Ptole∣mey.</HI> For <HI>Plinie</HI> reckoneth <HI>Coloniam Senensem,</HI> amongst the mid land Colonies of <HI>Hetruria;</HI> and not many lines after he placeth <HI>Senagallia</HI> in the sixth region of <HI>Italie. Ptolemey</HI> not only in the Latine copies printed, but also in most ancient manuscript Greeke copies, placeth <HI>Sena</HI> amongst the mid-land cities of <HI>Hetruria,</HI> but <HI>Sena Gallica,</HI> (for so he termeth it) amongst the cities of the <HI>Senones,</HI> neere <HI>Ancona</HI> and the Temple of Fortune.</P>
<P>When this city first was made a Bishops sea, although as yet it be not certainly knowne, yet this is certaine, that amongst the 46. Bishops, or there a∣bout, all of them neighbours to the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> (which in the first Romane Synod in the time of S. <HI>Hilary</HI> Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and first of the name, assem∣bled together in the yeare of Christ 465.) <HI>Eusebius Episcopus Senensis,</HI> was one of them. Againe in the second Councill of <HI>Lateran,</HI> vnder Pope <HI>Martin</HI> the first, in the yeare of Grace 652. amongst the subscriptions of 125. Bishops, these are named, <HI>Maurus Caesenatis Ecclesiae episcopus. Maurus episcopus S. Senatis ecclesiae,</HI> in the same maner and forme that <HI>Clusinus Roxellanus</HI> and <HI>Fauentinus,</HI> Bishops, do call their Churches <HI>Clusinatem, Roxellanatem,</HI> and <HI>Fauentinatem.</HI> In like maner amongst the like number of about 125. Bishops, who subscribed vnto the Epistle of <HI>Agatho</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> which the Legate sent vnto the six generall Councill at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> held in the yeare 573. caried with them, this subscription is found, <HI>Vitalianus episcopus S. ecclesiae Senensis.</HI> Whereupon it is manifest that no man may cauill and say, that <HI>Episcopus Senensis,</HI> is the same that <HI>Episcopus Senogalliensis:</HI> or that for <HI>Epi∣scopetus Senatis,</HI> it should be written and read, <HI>Episcopus Caesenatis.</HI> As also for that out of <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> before mentioned, it is plaine, that euen in their daies, that <HI>Sena</HI> of <HI>Picenum;</HI> was not called <HI>Sena,</HI> but <HI>Senogallia:</HI> Moreouer also because in the forenamed Councill of <HI>Lateran,</HI> not only <HI>Episco∣pus Senatis,</HI> but also <HI>Caesenatis</HI> and <HI>Senogalliensis,</HI> named by one and the same name, subscribed seuerally. Lastly, <HI>Venantius Episcopus Senogalliensis,</HI> subscri∣bed also to the second and fourth Synods of <HI>Rome,</HI> summoned by Pope <HI>Caelius Symmachus,</HI> about the yeare of Christ 498.</P>
<P>Furthermore Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the 2. borne in <HI>Siena,</HI> in the yeare 1459. (which was the yeare of his creation) aduanced the Church of <HI>Siena</HI> from a Bishops sea vnto the dignity of an Archbishopricke, and assigned the Bishops of <HI>Suano, Clusino, Crassetano,</HI> and <HI>Massano</HI> Suffraganes to the Archbishops of <HI>Siena,</HI> and their Churches subiect to that sea.</P>
<P>This hath <HI>Caesar Orlandius</HI> written, of the originall and antiquity of <HI>Siena,</HI> his natiue country, to be published, for no other cause, as he protesteth, then that the fond opinion of <HI>Blondus,</HI> and others which haue written otherwise of it then the plaine truth is, might wholly be rased out (if it were possible) of the minds of all men.</P>
<P><HI>Claudius Ptolemeus Senensis,</HI> in his sixth booke of epistles to <HI>Gabriel Caesano,</HI> hath most elegantly described <HI>Monte Argentario.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MARCA ANCONA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N former times this region was called <HI>Picenum,</HI> now they call it <HI>Marca Ancona,</HI> of the head city of the same. Sometime it was called <HI>Marca Firmiana,</HI> of a town in this prouince, as <HI>Blondus</HI> hath giuen out. It lieth between the riuers <HI>Isaurus,</HI> (now called <HI>Foglia,</HI>) and <HI>Trento,</HI> and betweene the Hadriaticke sea, and Mount Apennine. It is manifest by ancient records that the <HI>Piceni, Vmbri</HI> &amp; <HI>Senones,</HI> were long since seated in this tract. The country is a fertile soile, yeelding in great plenty all maner commodities, but especially for fruit trees &amp; corne it doth farre excell other places. <HI>Silius Italicus,</HI> doth highly commend it especially for oliues.</P>
<P>The head city, as we haue said, is <HI>Ancona,</HI> so called of his situation, for that being seated vpon the promontory <HI>Comerano,</HI> it lieth out into the gulfe of <HI>Venice</HI> like an arme or elbow. Whereupon the ancient comes of this city, (which heere oft times are found within the earth) are obserued to be stamped, with an arme holding a penne in the hand. The Hauen of this most ancient city, was made by <HI>Traian</HI> the Emperour, as an inscription in Marble doth giue to vnderstand. Heere is also <HI>Aelia Ricina,</HI> otherwise since that called <HI>Rici∣netum,</HI> (and at this day now, <HI>Recanati</HI>), is a towne situate vpon the toppe of an hill, where we saw the Mart or Faire (which there is kept at certaine times of the yeare) vnto which they come almost from all quarters of the World. Not farre from hence is the Church of S. <HI>Maria Lauretana,</HI> with the hamlet <HI>Loreto,</HI> enclosed with a very strong wall. The gorgeousnesse of this church and holinesse of the place is such, that so soone as one shall set foot within the dores, it will strike him into a great admiration. This Church is well furnished with all maner of weapons and engins, both for offence and defence a∣gainst the assault of Pirates. The village is inhabited almost of none els but Cooks, Ostlers, Shoemakers and such like fellowes, which attend heere ready to do any businesse, for such as resort hither almost all the yeare long in great numbers for deuotion: and to prouide and serue them with such things as they want. Heere is also the town and castle called <HI>Fabriano,</HI> whose inhabitants do almost altogether liue by making of Paper, which thereof is called <HI>Charta Fabriana.</HI> There are also many other goodly towns in this prouince, which are excellently described in <HI>Leander. Franciscus Pamphilus</HI> hath also written in verse a description of this Shire.</P>
<P>The Mount Apennine in this place hangeth ouer this country with craggy topps exceeding high, in which is that huge caue that they call <HI>Sibyllas caue,</HI> (in their language <HI>Grotta de la Sibylla</HI>) and which the poets faine to be the <HI>Elysian fields.</HI> For the common people do dreame of one <HI>Sibylla</HI> to be in this caue, which heere possesseth a large kingdome full of gorgeous buildings and Princely palaces, beset with pleasant gardens, abounding with many fine wanton wenches and all maner of pleasures and delights: all which she will bestow vpon them, which through this caue (which is alwaies open) will go vnto her: and after they haue been there the space of one whole yeare, they haue free liberty giuen them by <HI>Sibylla,</HI> (if they please) to depart, and from that time, being returned vnto vs, they affirme that they liue for the rest of their time, a most blessed and happy life. This caue is knowne also to our countrie-men by the name of <HI>Vrow Venus bergh,</HI> that is, The Lady <HI>Venus</HI> mount. Whereupon they vulgarly sing certaine Dutch rimes of one little <HI>Daniel</HI> (for so the ballad calleth him) who after that he had liued a whole yeare in this caue, at last it repented him of this kind of life, therefore heere he leauing his Loue departeth, goeth to <HI>Rome,</HI> commeth to the Pope, confesseth his sinne, and desireth to be absolued. The Pope not deeming the sinne to be veniall, the staffe which by chance he had in his hand, (withered and drie) sticking it into the ground, said, that his sinnes should then be pardoned when this staffe shall beare Roses. <HI>Daniel</HI> by this answeare despairing of his saluation, went away very heauy and discontent, and presently taking two of his nephewes, his sisters sonnes with him, returneth againe vnto his Paramour. Within three daies after the staffe was obserued to put forth blossomes: <HI>Daniel</HI> was sought for vp and down, but could no where be found: For they do beleeue that he spent the rest of his life in this caue. But the story of this ballade is a worthy matter for a poeticall head, and to be deemed as true as the rest of their fictions.</P>

The chiefe cities of it are, <HI>Aquila, Interamna</HI> or <HI>Teramo, Amatrice, Atri, Pinne:</HI> and long since heere haue stoode <HI>Amiterno,</HI> and <HI>Furconio,</HI> both now defaced, yet of their ruines and ashes is rai∣sed <HI>Aquila</HI> some fiue miles off, built vpon the toppe of an hill, as <HI>Volateran</HI> and others haue writ∣ten. This city is seated in a place most fertile of all maner of things necessary: so that the Cab∣badges heere (<HI>cauli capucei,</HI> they call them) do often weigh, as <HI>Mazella</HI> reporteth, sometime thir∣ty, sometime fortie pound; and therefore <HI>Martiall</HI> said not amisse, <HI>Nos amiternus ager felicibus e∣ducathortis;</HI> In <HI>Amiternoes</HI> fertile fields we liue and spend our daies. The fields before this citie, do yeeld such great plenty of Saffron, that thereof yearely they make 40000. ducates. Heere is once a yeare kept a great Faire. It hath 110. Churches. Neere this city, as <HI>Blondus</HI> saith, is a stone, from vnder the which runneth a streame of oile, which they call Oile of peter, or <HI>Petro∣leum:</HI> and is desired and sought for of many, but of the Almaines and Hungarians it is more esteemed, then of the Italians. The same authour recordeth that the country people shewed him a Peare-tree growing vpon an hill not farre from the head of the riuer <HI>Pescara</HI> or <HI>Aterno,</HI> shooting vp in such a sort, that the water falling vpon it, diuideth it selfe into three parts, which become three great riuers, <HI>Velino, Tronto</HI> and <HI>Pescara,</HI> running three diuers waies. <HI>Ami∣terno,</HI> in former times a goodly city, famous in histories, and the natiue country of <HI>Salust</HI> the no∣ble historian, can hardly be discerned where it stood: yet <HI>Blondus</HI> saith, that they do yet shew some pieces of the Theater, Temples, and Turrets. <HI>Mazella</HI> affirmeth that there yet do re∣maine the Temple of <HI>Saturne,</HI> the tombe of <HI>Drusus</HI> daughter, and a triumph of the Samnites engrauen in marble, a memoriall of their happie victory obtained against the Roman army, <HI>ad furcas Caudinas. Teramo</HI> long since called <HI>Interamnia,</HI> for that it is situate between three riuers, <HI>Fiumicello, Trontino</HI> and <HI>Vitiole,</HI> is the head city of this prouince; whose Bishop is graced with many titles and dignities, and the lord of the soile is called by the name of the Duke of <HI>Teramo. Adria</HI> the ancient colonie of the Romanes, is now called <HI>Atri.</HI> Some do thinke that the Empe∣rour <HI>Hadrian</HI> was borne heere, and of it tooke his name, as also the Hadriaticke sea, now called <HI>Mare superum,</HI> the higher sea, the Gulfe or Bay of <HI>Venice. Furconium</HI> sometime hath been a famous Bishopricke, whose Bishops are often mentioned in the Councels and Synods held 800. yeares since, at <HI>Rome</HI> or other places of <HI>Italie.</HI> At this day only some small mention is to be seen of it: for it was destroied by the Lombardes, and the Bishops sea, was by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the fourth, from thence translated vnto <HI>Aquila.</HI> The arms of this country, as <HI>Scipio Mazella</HI> writeth, is an Eagle argent crowned, standing vpon three mounts ore, in a field <HI>Azure.</HI> He that desireth to vnderstand more of this country let him repaire to the forenamed Authours, who I doubt not will satisfie him to the full.</P>

<HEAD>The kingdome of NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His kingdome generally comprehended between the Adriaticke and Mid-land seas, from the riuer <HI>Fronto</HI> and <HI>Fundi,</HI> a city situate vpon the lake <HI>Fundano,</HI> vnto the Frith <HI>Messina,</HI> (the Latines call it <HI>Fretum Mamertinum</HI> or <HI>Messanae,</HI> the Italians <HI>el faro di Messina</HI>) conteineth nine most rich and goodly countries of <HI>Italie:</HI> namely these; A part of <HI>Latium, Campania felix, Lucani, Calabria, Magna Graecia, Salentini, Apuli Peucetij, Apuli Dauni,</HI> and <HI>Aprutium.</HI> The gal∣lant city <HI>Naples,</HI> which gaue the name to the whole kingdome, seated between the sea shore and the foote of most pleasant mountaines; hath a temperate and wholesome aire, with most sweet fields about it: and therefore in this our age, Princes, and Noblemen do resort hither, asmuch as euer heeretofore: for almost all the Nobility of this whole kingdome do spend most of the yeare in this city, and all for the most part haue heere most beautifull and stately houses: so that the fre∣quent throng of Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Knights, Doctors, Barons, and Noble-men, is heere so great, that there are very few cities of the world which in my iudgement, in that respect may compare with <HI>Naples.</HI> The city in compasse is very large and wide, gorgeously built and seated, as I said, between the sea, and the goodly pleasant hils, strongly walled and fortified, especially that part which was done of late daies at the commandement of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth. The buildings either of Churches or priuate citizens houses are most beauti∣full and stately, with diuers Castles and Towers almost inuincible. But amongst the rest, the house of the Duke of <HI>Grauina,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Salerno,</HI> do farre excell. The streets of the city are very faire and straight. There are foure Courts, which they call Seats, <HI>Capuana, Nida, Montana,</HI> and <HI>S. Georgio,</HI> where the Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, and other of the Nobility do meet to consult of waighty matters and publike businesses. The strong Castels are these; <HI>Castello nouo,</HI> which <HI>Alphonsus</HI> the first raised and entrenched with very great charges and expences, so that now it may be accounted one of the most defencible fortification of all <HI>Europe.</HI> Next to this is <HI>Castello Capuano;</HI> which now is emploied for place of meeting for the state in consultation, for matters of the kingdome and city: Then is, <HI>Castellum oui,</HI> a little distance without the city, standing vpon a rocke (the ancients called it <HI>Meagrum</HI>) compassed round with the sea. Beside these is <HI>Castellum Santemerense,</HI> vpon a cliffe, looking ouer the walls of the city, lately fortified very strongly by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth. Without the wals, vpon the South side of the city, there is a Block-house in the sea, a worke of wonderfull art and cunning workemanship, built for the defence and safe∣gard of the Hauen, continually full with shippes almost from all quarters of the world. Heere also is an Vni∣uersitie where all maner of Arts and Liberall Sciences are taught and professed, vnto which there is great con∣course of students from all places of the kingdome. Thus farre <HI>Vbertus Folietta,</HI> in a Treatise of his, which he wrote and intituled <HI>Brumanum.</HI></P>
<P>Without the wals of this most stately city, there are most pleasant sweet fields, yeelding all maner of things necessarie, not onely for the maintainance of man and beast, but also such as serue for pleasure and delight: Especiallie with all maner of Corne and Graine, and of rich and strong Wine such plenty, that he that hath not seene the great store both of Corne and Wine that one Aker of ground doth yeeld, may hardlie be made to beleeue it. The Hilles and Mountaines in this place are very fertile, and full of most excellent fruits: and some of them, enclosing the lowly plaines in manner of a Theater, do affoord plentie of Deere and game for the Nobilitie. Moreouer about <HI>Naples</HI> are most pleasant and fine Orchards, planted with Medicinall plants, and such like goodlie fruite trees, euerie where resounding with a most sweet noise of brookes and streames running to and fro: euery where most fragrant and odoriferous smelles do offer themselues vnto your sen∣ses, such is the abundance of Myrtill, Laurell, Gelsemine, Rosemarie, Rose-trees, &amp;c. in euerie corner. To be short, the beauty, delightsomnesse, and elegancie of all places round about is such, as it doth almost exceed the capacitie of mans witte: no man need to wonder why in former times, as well as now, the Noble∣men so much delighted to dwell heere. This we haue taken out of <HI>Leander,</HI> where manie other things may be read of, who hath described the whole kingdome, this Citie, and the Liberties thereof, very curiouslie, that indeed it is not necessarie to send the Reader vnto any other Authour but <HI>Scipio Mazzella,</HI> (which in a seuerall and peculiar Treatise, hath with extraordinarie paines, and diligence, set out, in the Italian Tongue, a description of this kingdome. There is also in Print a little booke, written by <HI>Alexander Andreas,</HI> of the warre betweene <HI>Philippe</HI> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> the fourth Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> out of which the Reader which is not satis∣fied with this discourse of ours, may heere and there picke out something, concerning this kingdome, worth the noting and not triuiall. The booke is set out in the Italian tongue by <HI>Hieronymo Ruscello. Iohn Baptista Caraffa, Pontanus,</HI> and <HI>Pandulfus Collenutius,</HI> haue written the histories and chronicles of the kingdome of <HI>Naples:</HI> in the which they in diuers places speake much of the situation of this country. <HI>Gabriel Barry,</HI> hath very curiously de∣scribed <HI>Calabria,</HI> his natiue country, as <HI>Sanfelicius</HI> hath done <HI>Campania.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APVLIA, now called PVGLIA, or TERRA DI OTRANTO.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E haue composed this discourse following of this countrey, out of the treatise of <HI>Antony Galatey,</HI> which he wrote of the situation of <HI>Iapigya</HI> now called <HI>Terra di Barri.</HI> This country, saith he, in respect of his situation, is seated in the most temperate place of the world. Of diuers authours it hath beene diuersly called by sundry names. <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Herodotus</HI> called it <HI>Iapygia,</HI> others, <HI>Peucetia,</HI> others, <HI>Mesapia:</HI> others, <HI>Magna Gracia,</HI> Great <HI>Greece:</HI> others, <HI>Apulia:</HI> others, <HI>Calabria:</HI> (for that which now is called <HI>Calabria,</HI> was anciently called <HI>Brutia.</HI>) The corne, hearbs, and fruits of this country are of the best. The oats of this soile, is as good as the barly of other countries: and the barly, as good as their wheat. Melones of a most pleasing taste, and Pome∣citrons do euery where grow in great plenty. Physick herbs of greater force then other where, are here in all places very common. The aire is very wholesome, the soile is neither drie, nor squally or moorish. But these so great gifts and blessings of God are intermedled with some mischiefe and danger: for heere nature doth breed a most venemous and pernicious kind of spider, (the Greeks do call it <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Latines <HI>Phalangium</HI> and <HI>Araneus</HI>) whose poisonous bite is onely cured by Musicke or Tabret and Pipe. Heere is also the venimous serpent which the Greeks call <HI>Chersydros,</HI> the Latines <HI>Natrix terre∣stris,</HI> the Land snake; we call it, if I be not deceiued, <HI>an Adder:</HI> and heere is a kinde of Locust, which hurt and mar all things they light vpon. The cities of this country, long since more famous, were, <HI>Tarentum,</HI> now <HI>Taranto,</HI> proudly seated between two seas exceedingly stored with fish, in forme somewhat like a long Iland. This city in all mens iudgement is inuincible. <HI>Callipolis</HI> (now <HI>Galipoli, Pliny</HI> cal∣led it <HI>Anxa</HI>) is a city situate in the end of a promontorie or forland, shooting farre out into the sea, but with such a narrow Isthmos or necke-land, that in some places there is scarce so much as a cartway. It is very strong and round beset with high cliffes; from the maine land there is only one entrance, in the which is a very strong Castell. <HI>Hydruntum,</HI> of them called <HI>Otranto,</HI> is the chiefe city, and (which is somewhat more,) Metropolitan of the whole <HI>Peninsula,</HI> or Demi-ile, and that not without cause: for whether you respect the anti∣quity of it, the vertue and humanity of the citizens, ioined with valour and great magnanimity, it hath euer been of them accounted for a very famous and worthy city. It hath a very good and capacious hauen, but against the raging blasts of the North wind not so safe. It was sometime very strong and defencible, but now it lieth almost leuell with the ground. The fields adioining are very fruitfull; full of springs and alwaies green. From hence <HI>Montes Cerauni,</HI> certaine hills of <HI>Epirus,</HI> (now called <HI>Cimera</HI> and <HI>Canina</HI>) may easily be descried. Heere is the end of the Hadriaticke and Ionian seas, as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifieth. <HI>Brundusium</HI> now called <HI>Brindisi,</HI> a famous city, hath as notable a hauen as any in the world els where; the inner hauen is enclosed with castles and an huge chaine: the outer hauen is heere and there beset with rocks and small Ilands; but his mouth is by <HI>Alphonsoes</HI> meanes, so stopped and dette vp, that there is no entrance, but for little shippes and barges. It hath beene in former time a very populous city, now it is little inhabited. These are the chiefe marine ci∣ties. He that would know more particularly of the ancient names, situation, antiquities, and priuate stories of the mid-land cities and townes, we refer him to the learned discourse of <HI>Galatey,</HI> written of this his natiue country: to which if he please to adioine the descrip∣tion of <HI>Leander,</HI> I perswade my selfe the thirstie Reader shall not know what els he may demand.</P>

<HEAD>CALABRIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Abriel Barrius Franciscanus</HI> hath very curiously described <HI>Calabria</HI> in fiue bookes: which are imprinted at <HI>Rome</HI> with as lit∣tle heedfull diligence. Out of him we haue culled these particulars following: CALABRIA, saith he, a country of <HI>Italie,</HI> in forme and fashion not much vnlike a tongue, lieth between the vpper and neather seas. It beginneth at the neather sea, (the Greeks call it the <HI>Tyrrhen</HI> sea, the Latines the Mediterran or Mid-land sea,) from the riuer <HI>Talao,</HI> which runneth into the Bay of <HI>Policastro:</HI> at the vpper sea (the <HI>Ionian</HI> sea, the Grecians terme it) from the riuer <HI>Siris</HI> (otherwise sometime cal∣led, <HI>Senno</HI>) and coasteth along vntill it come to the streights of <HI>Faro di Messano,</HI> and the city <HI>Regio:</HI> and so being diuided longwise by the mount <HI>Apennine</HI> (heere they call it <HI>Aspro monte</HI>) it endeth in two capes or promontories, the one called <HI>Leucopetra,</HI> (of them <HI>Capo de Leocopetra</HI>) the other <HI>Lacinium</HI> (vulgarly of them called <HI>Cabo delle colonne,</HI> or <HI>Cabo dell' Alice.</HI>) Not only the plaines and champions, but euen the hillie places, like vnto <HI>Latium</HI> or <HI>Campania,</HI> are well serued with water. Whatsoeuer is necessary for the maintainance of mans life, this country doth yeeld in great abundance, it needeth no forraine commodities, but is able to liue of it selfe. <HI>Calabria</HI> gene∣rally is a good and a fertile soile, it is not combred with Fennes, Lakes or Bogges, but is alwaies green, affoording good pastorage for cattell, and excellent ground for all sorts of graine. The fountaines and brooks are many, and those passing cleare and wholesome. The sunnie hills and mountaines, open to euery coole blast of wind, are wonderfull fertile for corne, vines, and trees of diuers kinds, whereof arise great profit to the inhabitants. The valleies are pleasant and fruitfull. The shady groues and woods do affoord many pleasures and delights. The goodly meddowes and pastures are richly decked with herbs, and sweet-smelling flowres, and euer-running streames. And amongst other, heere is great plenty of Medicke fodder, wherewith they feed and fatte their cattell. Heere also grow many excel∣lent physicke hearbs of soueraigne vertues against diuers and sundrie diseases. It bringeth forth diuers plants, as the Plane tree, <HI>Vitex</HI> or <HI>Agnus castus,</HI> the Turpentine tree, the Oliue tree, <HI>Siliqua Siluestris,</HI> Arbute or Strawberry tree, wild Saffron, Madder, Liquirise, Tube∣ra or Sowbread. It hath also some hoate baths, continually distilling from their fountaines, which do cure aches and many other like maladies. In diuers places there are springs of salt water, whereof they make a kind of brine or pickle. It is well watered with many fine riuers, and those stored with sundrie sorts of fresh fish. The sea also on ech side yeeldeth great plenty of fish, both tunies, sword-fishes, and lampreies. There in many places is found the best Corall, both white and redde. Heere is most pleasant hunting and hawking: for in these quarters diuers and sundrie sorts of wild beasts do lodge; and as many birds and fowles do breed and build: wild boares, harts, hindes, goates, hares, foxes, lynces, otters, squerrells, martens, badgers, ferrets, porkupines, tortuses, both of the waters and of the mountaines. Of fowles, phesants, partridges, quailes, wood-cocks, ring-doues, crowes, &amp;c. as also of many kinds of hawks it is euery where full. It maintaineth some herds of cattell and flocks of sheep and goats. It breedeth excellent horses, very swift and of great stomacke. Mettals heere were found in old time, and now also it aboundeth at this day with diuers kinds of mineralls: hauing indeed euery where mines of gold, siluer, iron, salt, marble, alablaster, crystall, marchasite, red-lead, or vermillion, copperas, alume, brim∣stone &amp;c. many kinds of corne, wheat, siligo, beerbarly, rie, trimino, (we call it, I thinke, Turky wheat) barly, rise, and of sesamum infinite store. It aboundeth also with all kind of pulse, (<HI>legumina</HI> the Latines call them,) oile, wine and hony, and those in their kinds the best. There are heere euery where orchards thicke set with oranges, limons, and pome cittron trees. Heere also is made great plenty of excellent silke, farre better then any kind of silke made in other places of <HI>Italie.</HI> The Cotton tree <HI>(Gossipium,)</HI> groweth heere plentifully. But what shall I speake of the kind temperature of the aire? For heere the fields both winter and summer are continuallie green. But aboue all things, there is nothing that doth argue the same more soundly then that airy dew or heauenly hony, which they call <HI>Manna,</HI> that euery where distilleth from aboue, and is heere gathered in great abundance. So that that which the Israelites in the wildernes did admire and hold for a strange wonder, heere kind nature doth affoord of her own accord. It is adorned also with many goodly market towns, where marts and faires are kept at certaine times of the yeare. Heere in some places still is obserued the ancient custome of the Romanes vsed at funerals and buriall of the dead, where a chiefe mourner (<HI>Praefica,</HI> they called her) is hired to go before the rest of the mourners and she to guide their mournefull ditties and to keepe time in their howling lamentations. The funerall being done and all ceremonies performed, the dead mans friends and kindred, bringing their meat and iunkets, do banquet altogether at the dead mans house. The women of this country naturally, for modesty, and for that the waters of these places are good and wholesome, drinke naught but water. It is a shame for any women to drinke wine, except she be very old, or be in child-bed, &amp;c. See more in the same authour. <HI>Cassiodore</HI> also in his <HI>Variar.</HI> hath in diuers places many things of this country.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here is not one either of the ancient Historians or Cosmographers, that hath not made mention of this Iland, or curiously described the same: especially <HI>Strabo, Plinie, Solimus</HI> and others. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> calleth it, <HI>The soueraigne of all other Ilands. Solinus</HI> in like maner writeth of it, That whatsoeuer this country breedeth either of the nature of the soile, or inuention of man, it is little inferiour to those things which are esteemed of greatest worth. Of the la∣ter writers, <HI>Vadianus</HI> hath thus set it out in his true colours: SICILIA, not only for richnesse of the soile, (for which cause it was of the ancients dedicated to <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and was accounted the <HI>Garner of Rome</HI>) but also for the multitude and antiquity of his townes, famous actes, victories and quarrels betweene the Romans and Carthagians, both contending for the mastery, is more famous then any other Iland whatsoeuer. In <HI>Plinies</HI> time there were 72. cities: at this day they report it to containe twelue Bishopricks, of great iurisdiction and large diocesses. The Dukes of <HI>Swevland</HI> posses∣sed it a long time. It was assaulted and taken by the English &amp; Lorreiners, especially at that time when they made their voiage into the <HI>Holy land,</HI> against the impious Saracens. Lastly, it fell vnto the Kings of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and so at this day it remaineth vnder the obedience of <HI>Spaine.</HI> Neither is there any other Iland, that I know, in the whole world, that both Greeks and Latines haue indifferently, partly in respect of the goodnesse of the soile and situation, partly for the great accidents that heere haue happened, by their writings made more famous.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat this Iland hath been in former times called AENARIA, ARIMA, INARIMA, and PITHECVSA, <HI>Homer, Aristotle, Strabo, Pliny, Virgill, Ouid,</HI> and other good writers are sufficient witnesses. Now it is called ISCHIA of the name of the city there, built vpon the top of an hill, in forme somewhat like the Hucklebone, as <HI>Her∣molaus Barbarons</HI> testifieth, which of the Greeks is named <HI>Ischia:</HI> or rather of the strength and defenciblenes of the place, as <HI>Volaterranus</HI> thinketh. Although it be sure that these be but synonymes of one and the same iland, yet <HI>Mela, Liuie,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> do seeme to make <HI>Aenaria</HI> and <HI>Pithecusa</HI> two distinct iles: as also <HI>Ouid</HI> may be thought to do in these verses: <HI>Inarimen Prochitam{que} legit, sterili{que} locatas Colle Pithecusas, habitan∣tum nomine dictus.</HI> By <HI>Inarime</HI> he saileth, by <HI>Prochyte</HI> ile, by barren <HI>Pithecuse,</HI> A town on toppe of loftie cragge, where wilie Apes do vse. Where by <HI>Pithecusas,</HI> as I thinke, he vnderstandeth the city ancientlie, (as also now it is,) of the same name with the whole iland. Which, although now it be obserued to be ioi∣ned to the Ile, yet in former ages it was called <HI>Gerunda,</HI> and was apart and disioined from the ile, as <HI>Pontanus,</HI> a man of good credit, doth testifie in his second booke which he wrote of the warres of <HI>Naples:</HI> where he affirmeth, that in his time it was ioined vnto the Iland by a causway made between them. <HI>Prochita</HI> not farre distant from hence, (which <HI>Plinie</HI> doth write to haue been seuered from <HI>Pithecusa</HI>) doth shew that this was sometime adioined to, and sometime disioined from this Iland. The same authour doth affirme, (which <HI>Strabo</HI> also doth approue,) that all these sometime were cut off from the maine continent, and to haue been part of the cape <HI>Miseno.</HI> This doth the forenamed <HI>Pontanus</HI> in his sixth booke confirme, in these words: That <HI>Aenaria,</HI> saith he, was cutte off, from the maine continent, many things do demonstrate: namely, The torne rocks, The hollow ground full of caues, The nature of the soile, like vnto that of the continent, leane, drie, and spuing out hotte springs and fountaines. It breedeth flaming fires in the middest of the earth, wherefore it is manifest that it conteineth much Alume. <HI>Andreas Baccius,</HI> in that his famous worke of the Bathes of the whole world, writeth, that this iland doth counterfait <HI>Campania,</HI> (of which it was sometime a part) not only in respect of the fertility of the soile, but also for like∣nesse, and similitude of the bathes. <HI>Erythraeus</HI> vpon the 9. booke of <HI>Virgills</HI> Aeneiads, doth thinke it to be called <HI>Arima,</HI> of a kind of people or beasts so named: and that <HI>Virgill</HI> was the first, that when he translated that of <HI>Homer,</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, of the Ionicke preposition <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> altering the declension and number, did make the new word <HI>Inarime.</HI> Yet <HI>Plinie</HI> in the 6. chapter of his 3. booke and <HI>Solinus</HI> surnamed <HI>Polyhistor,</HI> are of a contrary opinion, which do affirme it to be of <HI>Homer</HI> also called <HI>Inarime.</HI> And as the same <HI>Pliny</HI> reporteth, it was cal∣led <HI>Aenaria,</HI> for the ships of <HI>Aeneas</HI> put into harborough heere: &amp; <HI>Pithecusa,</HI> not of the great store of Apes there found, but of Coopers shops or warehouses. But this opinion the same <HI>Erythraeus</HI> in the foresaid place laboureth to ouerthrow, as not altogether consonant to the truth, for that of tunnes made for this purpose, he protesteth that he hath not read of in any authour whatsoeuer. Yet <HI>Seruius</HI> in my iudgement seemeth vpon the forcited 6. of <HI>Virgils</HI> Aeneads, to stand for <HI>Pliny,</HI> where he saith, that by <HI>Cumae</HI> there was a certaine place named <HI>Doliola,</HI> that is, if we should interpret it, <HI>Tunnes.</HI> And it is more likely, that this Iland should take the name from that place, with which sometime it was vnited, according to the opinion of these good authours, rather then of apes, (for I regard not the fable of <HI>Ouid</HI>) of which beasts none are heere, or euer were. That this Iland from the beginning hath been subiect to earth-quakes, flames of fire, and hot waters from thence oft breaking out, we are certified by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny.</HI> The mountaine which <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth <HI>Epomeus,</HI> and <HI>Pliny Epopos,</HI> now they call it S. <HI>Nicolas mount,</HI> which for the same cause they report to haue burned inwardly at the bottome: and being sha∣ken with an earthquake to haue somtimes cast out great flakes of fire. Heere hence arose that fable of <HI>Typhon</HI> the giant, (wherof you may read in <HI>Homer, Virgill, Silius Italicus,</HI> (who calleth him <HI>Iapetus) Lucane</HI> and others) as the same <HI>Strabo</HI> interpreteth, which they fable to lie vnderneath this hill, and to breath out fire and water. That it is on euery side wonderfully fertile, of the last writers, <HI>Io. Elysius, Fran. Lombardus, Io. Pontanus, Solenander, Andreas Baccius,</HI> and especially <HI>Iasolinus</HI> the authour of this map, hath shewed abundantly: who in it doth reckon vp, beside the 18. naturall bathes which others haue written of 35. other, first discouered by himselfe. The same author also beside these baths doth make mention of 19. stoues or hot houses, (<HI>fumarolas</HI> they call them) and 5. medicinall sands, soueraigne in Physick for the drying vp of raw humours. Of this fire heere in the bowels of the earth, <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his booke of the Miracles of Nature, affirmeth that heere are certaine stoues, which do burne with fierie kind of force and exceeding feruent heate, and yet neuer do burst out into flames: But <HI>Elysius, Pandulphus</HI> and <HI>Pontanus</HI> do report the contrary. There is a place in this Iland <HI>Ischia,</HI> about a mile from the city of the same name, which, of the raging fire that happened heere in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> II in the yeare 1301. is at this day called <HI>Cremate.</HI> For heere the bowels of the earth cleauing in sunder, by the flashing fire that flamed out, a great part of it was so consumed, that a small village being first burnt down, was at the last vtterly swallowed vp. And casting vp into the aire huge stones, intermedled with smoke, fire, and dust, which falling againe by their own force and violence, scattered heere and there vpon the ground, made a most fertile and pleasant iland, wast and desolate. This fire continued the space of two moneths, so that many, both men and beasts were by it destroied: and many shipping themselues &amp; their goods forced to flie either to the ilands neere adioining, or to the maine continent. Yet this iland for many things is very fruitfull: for in it there are excellent good wines and those of diuerse kinds, as that which they call Greeks wine, Latine, Sorbinio and <HI>Cauda caballi.</HI> It beareth good corn about S. <HI>Nicolas</HI> mount. In it the Cedar, the pomecitron, and the Quince tree, do grow euery where most plentifully. Alume and Brimstone are found deep within the earth: it hath had long since some veines of gold, as <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Elysius</HI> haue written, and now hath as <HI>Iasolinus</HI> affirmeth. About the hill, (commonly called <HI>Monte Ligoro</HI>) there is great store of phesants, hares, conies, and other wild beasts: neere the cape of S. <HI>Nicolas</HI> they take much fish, and withall find much Co∣rall. Not farre from thence is the hauen <HI>Ficus</HI> or <HI>Fichera,</HI> where the water boileth so hot, that in it flesh or fish are sodden in a short time, and yet notwithstanding it is of a pleasant tast and very sauory. There is a fountaine which they call <HI>Nitroli,</HI> in which this is admi∣rable, that besides his great vertues for the cure of certaine diseases, if you shall lay flax in it, within three daies at the most it will make it as white as snow. Whereupon the authour of this Table saith, that this ile for bignesse, good aire, fertility of soile, mines of mettall, strong wines, doth far surpasse the other 25. ilands which are in the bay of <HI>Naples.</HI> Betweene the foreland called <HI>Acus,</HI> the needle, and that other named <HI>Cephalino,</HI> there is a great caue, or safe harborough for ships, especially for pinnaces &amp; those lesser sorts of ships. Heere it is like that <HI>Aeneas</HI> landed, of which <HI>Ouid</HI> speaketh: as also <HI>Pompey,</HI> when as he sailed from <HI>Sicilia</HI> to <HI>Puteoli,</HI> whereof <HI>Appian</HI> writeth in his 5. booke of Ciuill wars. In this same Iland ouer against <HI>Cumae,</HI> there is a lake in which there is continually great plenty of Sea∣mews or Fenducks (<HI>Larus</HI> or <HI>Fulica</HI>) these are very gainfull and profitable to the inhabitants. The words of <HI>Pliny</HI> speaking of this iland are worth the noting. In the same, saith he, a whole town did sinke: and at another time by an earthquake the firme land became a stan∣ding poole, <HI>stagnum</HI> he calleth it: (although that the ancient printed copies for <HI>stagnum</HI> haue <HI>statinas;</HI> in which place the learned <HI>Scaliger</HI> had rather read <HI>statiuas,</HI> meaning standing waters.) The same <HI>Pliny</HI> hath left in record, that if one heere shall cut down a Cedar tree, yet it will shoot forth and bud againe. <HI>Liuy</HI> saith that the <HI>Chalcidenses</HI> of <HI>Euboea</HI> did first inhabit this iland: yet <HI>Strabo</HI> saith they were the <HI>E∣retrienses.</HI> But these also came from the ile <HI>Euboea.</HI> I am of opinion that <HI>Athenaeus</HI> in his 9 booke, although he nameth it not, yet he mea∣neth this iland, which he affirmeth he saw, (as he sailed from <HI>Dicaearchia</HI> vnto <HI>Naples</HI>) inhabited by a few men, but full of copies. There is also neere vnto this, <HI>Prochyta,</HI> an iland so named, not of <HI>Aeneas</HI> his nurse, but because it was <HI>profusa ab Aenaria,</HI> seuered from <HI>Aenaria,</HI> or as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his 5. booke affirmeth from <HI>Pithecusae.</HI> Notwithstanding in his I. booke he writeth that it was sundered from <HI>Miseno:</HI> yet both may be true: for aswell this, as that by inundations and tempestuous storms were rent off from the maine land. The poets same that <HI>Minas</HI> the giant lieth vnder this Iland, as <HI>Typhon</HI> doth vnder <HI>Ischia.</HI> Of which <HI>Horace</HI> in his 3. booke of Poems writeth to <HI>Calliope. Andreas Baccius</HI> writeth thus of this ile; It is a little ile, saith he, but very pleasant, rich of mettals and hot bathes, notwithstanding for the continuall fires, which the continuall tides of the sea do kindle in it, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, it neuer was much inhabited. It retaineth still the ancient name; for they now call it <HI>Procida.</HI> Of this iland you may read more in <HI>Scipio Mazella,</HI> in his additions vnto the tract of <HI>E∣lysius</HI> of the Bathes of <HI>Puteoli.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CANDIA, sometime called CRETA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Reta,</HI> which now they call <HI>Candia,</HI> is bigger then <HI>Cyprus,</HI> but lesser then <HI>Sicilia,</HI> or <HI>Sardinia:</HI> vnto which ilands only in the Mediterran sea it is inferiour. Yet for worth and fertility it is equall to the best. Ancient Historiographers do affirme that once it was famous for one hundred cities, and therefore was called <HI>Hecatompolis.</HI> In the time of <HI>Pliny</HI> it had not aboue forty. At this day, as <HI>P. Bellonius</HI> testifieth it hath not aboue three of any account, that is, <HI>Candy,</HI> a colonie of the Venetians, (whereof the whole iland is now named,) <HI>Canea</HI> and <HI>Rhetimo.</HI> The compasse of the iland is about 520. miles. It is euery where full of mountaines and hils, and therefore the inhabitants are much giuen to hunting. There is in it neuer a riuer that is nauigable, nor any venemous or hurtfull beast. The ex∣cellent wine, which they heere call <HI>Maluasia,</HI> and is from hence transported almost into all countries, hath made this iland famous all the world ouer. This kind of wine old writers called <HI>Pramnium,</HI> as <HI>Bellonius</HI> recordeth. <HI>Vola∣terran</HI> is of opinion that it is called <HI>Maluisia,</HI> for <HI>Aruisia,</HI> by the addition of one letter. And he furthermore addeth, that that kind of vine was first brought into <HI>Creta</HI> from the cape <HI>Aruisium</HI> in the ile <HI>Chios,</HI> (now <HI>Scio</HI>) and therefore the wines were called <HI>vina aruisia.</HI> Heere is great store of <HI>Cypresse</HI> trees, (whereof they make their ships,) which are of such great height, as <HI>Dom. Niger</HI> reporteth, that it is a most goodly fight to behold. In this iland was the Maze or Labyrinth built by <HI>Daedalus</HI> after the patterne, as <HI>Plinie</HI> saith, of that in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> A mention of which, as <HI>George Alexander,</HI> the Lieutenant of this iland for the Venetians, affirmeth in <HI>Volaterran,</HI> do re∣maine vnto this day.</P>
<P>There is a mountaine, saith he, cut through, hollow euery way with many windings and turnings, and hath one onely narrow and straite en∣trance. The guide, a man that well knoweth the place, goeth before with a burning torch, directing the way in and out, and shewing the strange cranks in the darke corners. But <HI>Peter Bellone,</HI> a curious searcher of ancient monuments and antiquities, and one that in our age diligently viewed this iland, saith that this in old time was a quarry of stone, not a Labyrinth. (Notwithstanding that the people of the country do so call it) which indeed is more probable, seeing that <HI>Pliny</HI> affirmeth that in his time there remained no signe of it. But of this place take this description of <HI>P. Bellone,</HI> There is a place between <HI>Gnosium</HI> and <HI>Cortina,</HI> which hauing been obserued to be verie conuenient for the cutting and digging out of stone, the country people made there a Stone-mine <HI>(lapidicinam)</HI> out of which when as many stones were digged there were many windings and turnings left, so that he which by himselfe will venture to go vp and downe in this stone-pit, he shall light vpon many crooks and by-waies, and may easily loose himselfe. Neere to the riuer <HI>Leth,</HI> is this falsly-supposed-labyrinth, the which if any be desirous to see, he must needs vse the help of some one or other of the country people of the next village, to go in before him with candle to guide and direct him. But in it such a number of Battes do lodge, that except a man do take great heed they will by their flying vp and downe, put out the candle with their wings. In the bot∣tome of the pitte are found great heaps of Battes dong, and their little yong ones yet hanging vpon the sides and wals. The dammes when they can no longer flie, do not cleaue and sticke to the wall, nor stand vpon their feet, but there they hang vpon the beams and rafters, as our Battes do in the clifts of timber and holes of walles. Thus farre <HI>Bellonius.</HI> (The like story vnto this, altogether as <HI>Bellonius</HI> reporteth it, in my mind I haue seen, when as for recreation I trauelled from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Hostia,</HI> and in my iourney at the hauen of <HI>Traiane</HI> I went vnder the ground, first hiring mine host to go before me with a light, that I might view the ruines of the same.) It was anciently dedicated to <HI>Iupiter,</HI> because that heere, old folks did thinke, he was bred, and brought vp, and at length buried. <HI>Bordonius</HI> affirmeth that vpon the North side of this iland there is a great caue vnderneath the earth, made by the labour and industrie of man, forty cubites in length, and foure in breadth: which at this day they call <HI>Iupiters tombe,</HI> and that vpon the head of it yet to this day his Epitaph remaineth written in great Capitall letters.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that the people haue been long since accounted for the best Mariners, as being wholly inuironed with the sea: and from thence arose that by-word, <HI>Cretensis mare nescit,</HI> A Cretian hath no skill in sailing. They haue of old been very infamous for their leuity, deceit, lying, and other such like vices: Heere hence sprong these prouerbs, <HI>Cretiza cum Cretensi, Cretensis Cretensem, Cretensis cum Aeginate, E Creta raptus. &amp;c.</HI> of which thou maist read in <HI>Erasmus</HI> his Chiliades. Wherefore they are also ill reported of by S. <HI>Paul</HI> for the same faults. But I feare me least that which hath commonly been spoken of the Cretian, may indeed be truly verified of many other Nations, nay I would to God that all Nations wheresoeuer all the world ouer were not in this of kinne to the Cretians.</P>
<P><HI>L. Caecilius Metellus Creticus</HI> first brought this iland vnder the command of the Romans, about the yeare 685. after the building of <HI>Rome:</HI> Af∣terward it was subiect to the Emperours of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> Then it was giuen to <HI>Bonifacius</HI> of <HI>Monteferrato:</HI> by whom it was sold to the Venetians, in the yeare of Christ 1194. to whom at this day it doth belong. Amongst the ancient Geographers <HI>Strabo</HI> hath curiously described this iland: Amongst the latter writers <HI>Domi. Niger, Volaterran, Vadian, Zieglerus,</HI> and <HI>Bened. Bordonius,</HI> haue done the like. But most excellently of all o∣thers and exactly <HI>Iodocus Ghistelius</HI> in his iourney to <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and <HI>Bellonius</HI> in his obseruations. <HI>Iodocus à Meggen,</HI> also hath something of this Iland, in his Peregrination to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> worth the obseruation and reading. We are beholding to that braue nobleman, The Honourable <HI>Sign. Francisco Superantia,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Venice,</HI> not only a louer of the Mathematicks and earnest student of Geographie, but a worthy esteemer of all maner of learning.</P>

<HEAD>Certaine Ilands in the sea ARCHIPELAGO.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He <HI>Aegaean</HI> sea (now called <HI>Archipelago</HI>) conteineth many ilands, as the <HI>Cyclades, Sporades</HI> and diuers others, of which, some of the chiefe we haue described in this plotte. NEGROPONTE, sometime called <HI>Eubooea:</HI> his chiefe city then was called <HI>Chalcis,</HI> now they call it <HI>Negroponte,</HI> whereof the whole iland tooke the name. It was not long since wholly subiect vnto the Venetians: from whom it was taken by the Turks about the yeare of Christ 1471. It yeeldeth great plenty of oile, corne and wine, and is of all things that the earth bringeth forth, very fertile, especially it affoordeth very good wood for the making of shippes and gallies, as <HI>Anonymus</HI> reporteth, who wrote of the sacking and taking of it. The inhabitants (which is almost generally true in all the iles of this sea) are partly Greeks, and partly Turks: but each vseth his owne language and religion. NICSIA, in old time <HI>Naxos,</HI> is accounted one of the most fertile ilands of this sea. It yeeldeth good store of Wine. Some do thinke that heere is a veine of Gold, but such is the slouth and negli∣gence of the people, that yet it is not knowne where about it is. Heere is a kind of Waspe whose sting they report to be deadly. Heere are very many Battes. It was sometime belonging to <HI>Iohanni Quirino,</HI> a nobleman of <HI>Venice:</HI> afterward it came into the possession of a certaine captaine named <HI>Iacobo Crispo,</HI> whom <HI>Solimus</HI> the Turke draue from hence. Therefore it is now inhabited by Turks and Iewes.</P>
<P>SANTORINI, of the ancients called by the name of <HI>Therasia.</HI> This Iland riseth by little and little euen from the shore vnto the middest, vntill it become an high mountaine, vpon whose toppe is placed the castle <HI>Scaro.</HI> The people for the most part liue by fishing. This also, as the other, is vnder the command of the great Turke. SCIO, the old writers called it <HI>Chios,</HI> is all full of trees and mountaines: it is watered with many small brooks. <HI>Vinum aruisium,</HI> (they now call it <HI>Maluasia</HI>) was from hence first transported into <HI>Candia.</HI> This iland only breedeth the Mastiche-tree, whose gumme from hence is conueied all Christendome ouer. <HI>Andronicus Palaeologus</HI> the Emperour of <HI>Constantinople</HI> gaue it to the Genowaies, who possessed it vntill the yeare 1465. when as <HI>Soliman</HI> by a wile gatte it from them. The women of this ile are commended aboue all other for fauour and beauty. Of this you may read in <HI>Laonicus</HI> his tenth booke. RHODVS, still retaineth the ancient name. It hath a city of the same name, very strong and defensible, with a very large and capacious hauen. It is the more famous for the <HI>Colossus</HI> of the sunne, a statue or image seuentie cubites high, which being broken off at the knees by an earth-quake, was ouerthrown &amp; fell to the ground. Certaine Egyptians, as <HI>Domi. Niger</HI> re∣porteth, in the time of <HI>Constance</HI> the Emperour, passing the sea from <HI>Alexandria</HI> to <HI>Rhodus,</HI> amongst other things, ouerthrew this <HI>Colossus,</HI> brake it in pieces, and with the brasse did lade away 900. camels. It was giuen by <HI>Emanuel</HI> Emp. of <HI>Constantinople</HI> vnto the knights of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which for a long time and often did valiantly defend it against the furious assaults of the Turks, vntill in the yeare 1522. when as <HI>Solyman</HI> besieging it round by sea and land; they were forced to yeeld it vp, and to flie into the ile <HI>Melita.</HI> Of these see more in <HI>Theodoricus Adamaeus.</HI> STALAMINE, this the Gretians in old time called <HI>Lemnos.</HI> Of it read that which we shall write in the description of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> MILO, former ages long since cal∣led it <HI>Melos.</HI> In it is a mine of Siluer, where also is found the Sardoine, a pretious stone. METELLINO, old writers called it <HI>Lesbot.</HI> It hath a city of the same name, shaken and ruined by an earth-quake. They are vnder the gouernment of the Turke, as the other, yet they retaine their old language and religion. CERIGO, in old time they called it <HI>Cythera.</HI> SCARPANTO, the ancients named it <HI>Carpathus,</HI> or as <HI>Homer</HI> writeth it <HI>Crapathus:</HI> whereupon the sea about this place was called <HI>Mare Carpathium.</HI> It is situate almost in the mid-way between <HI>Candia</HI> and <HI>Rhodus.</HI> It is in compasse forty, or as others affirme, fifty miles. <HI>Eustathius</HI> in his commentaries vpon <HI>Homer,</HI> saith that it is craggy and euery where mountai∣nous and full of hils, and was called <HI>Porphyris</HI> in old time of the great abundance of Purples, (a kind of fish, whereof commeth the purple colour) found in this sea: and <HI>Tetrapolis,</HI> of the foure cities in this iland. From this iland sprong that prouerbe, <HI>Carpathius leporem,</HI> as the same <HI>Eustathius</HI> deliuereth out of <HI>Iulius Pollux.</HI> It is spoken of those which do so do a thing, that afterward being done, they do repent them of it. Because these Ilanders first brought in hares into this country, and within a little while after, when they perceiued how they eat and spoiled their corne, they de∣stroied them againe. It hath many Hauens, but those very narrow, shallow and dangerous. The inhabitants do speake the Greeke tongue, and professe the Religion of the Greeke Church, but are subiect to the iurisdiction and gouernment of the Signiory of <HI>Venice.</HI> You may read more of these ilands in <HI>Bordonius</HI> and <HI>Porcacchius,</HI> which in the Italian tongue haue written peculiar treatises of Ilands.</P>

There is a kind of stuffe made there of goates haire, which now we call <HI>Chamelett,</HI> the Italians <HI>Zambelloto.</HI> This Iland sendeth ouer diuers commodities into other countries, where∣of they yearely raise great profit and gaines; it doth not much stand in need of any forrein commodities or mer∣chandise. The aire is not very wholesome nor healthfull. The people generally do giue themselues to pleasures, sports and voluptuousnesse: the women are very wanton, and of light behauiour. The fruitfulnesse of it is so great, that in old time they called it <HI>Macaria,</HI> that is, The Blessed Iland; and the lasciuiousnesse of the nation such, that vulgarly it was supposed to haue beene dedicated to <HI>Venus</HI> the Goddesse of loue. It is 427. miles about, and 200. long, as <HI>Bordonius</HI> hath recorded. The Venetians do hold it by right of inheritance, and is vnder them gouerned by a Lieutenant or Praetor. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in his 16. booke saith, that in this iland were nine good∣ly cities, which had their seuerall petie Kings, by whom they were gouerned; all notwithstanding subiect to the King of <HI>Persia.</HI> Inferiour townes also were commanded by their proper Kings.</P>
<P>But that the fertility of this ile may better appeare, I thinke it good to set downe that commendation of <HI>Am∣mianus Marcellinus,</HI> which he hath left behind him of it; <HI>Cyprus,</HI> saith he, is so fertile and aboundeth with such va∣riety of all things, that without the help of any forrein commodities, only of themselues it is able to build a ship from the keel to the toppe saile, and send it to the sea ridged and furnished with all things necessary whatsoeuer. <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> also hath these words of it; <HI>Cyprus;</HI> famous for wealth and great riches, tempted the poore and needy Romanes to inuade it, so that we held the possession of that iland iniustly and rather for gaine, then for any right we had vnto it. But this, ô <HI>Rufus,</HI> is not, as they say, mercenary commendation of the Roman valour.</P>
<P>Amongst the ancient writers, <HI>Strabo, Mela,</HI> and other Geographers haue described this Iland: Of the latter, <HI>Benedictus Bordonius</HI> in his treatise of Ilands: <HI>Vadianus, Pius</HI> the second Pope of <HI>Rome, Domin. Niger, Sabellicus, Vola∣terran,</HI> and <HI>Iacobus Zieglerus</HI> passing well: <HI>Stephanus Lusignanus,</HI> hath in the French tongue written a peculiar booke of this Iland.</P>

<HEAD>STALAMINE, sometime called LEMNOS.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Emnos,</HI> an Iland of the Aegean sea, lieth ouer against <HI>Thrace, (Romania)</HI> between the Peninsula or Neck-land of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and the mount <HI>Athon</HI> of <HI>Macedonie.</HI> Famous long since for <HI>Vulcanes</HI> shoppe, and now as much talked of for the medicinall earth (which of the Physitions is called <HI>Terra Lemnia</HI>) that heere is digged out. At this day this ile, is called of the Turks and Italians, <HI>Stalamine.</HI> It is 100. miles about, as <HI>Bordonius</HI> affirmeth: And is a plaine and champion country, in respect of the Ilands round about it. On the East side, as <HI>Bellonius</HI> reporteth, it is leane and no good corne ground: between the South and West parts, where it is more moist, it is much more fertile. Anciently it had two cities, <HI>Myrina</HI> and <HI>Ephestias:</HI> this latter is wholly desert and not inhabited, is now called <HI>Cochino.</HI> That at this day is a towne of small account, situate in a Demy-ile or Peninsula, ioined to the Iland by a narrow necke or Isthmos; at this day it is called <HI>Lemno.</HI> In this iland, as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifieth, there was a Labyrinth, the third in estimation from that of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> But <HI>Bellonius</HI> narrowly see∣king for his foundation, could not find any mention of it: nor any of the country that could shew him any more then certaine pieces of it. The same authour affirmeth that there are yet remaining in it 75. villages. The earth which anciently was called <HI>Sphragida</HI> and <HI>Terra Lemnia,</HI> commonly <HI>Terra sigillata,</HI> is now, (as in old time it was wont) digged out of the ground not without a certaine kind of superstitious ceremony, euery yeare vpon the sixth day of August; and at no time els. For vpon paine of death, it is decreed that no man either priuately or openly shall go thither to digge out ought.

<HEAD>GREECE.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Reece,</HI> which sometime was as it were the mother and nurce of all good learning and disci∣plines, of a rich and wealthy country, and which by his valour and magnanimity was Em∣presse &amp; Prince of the better halfe of the world, is at this day driuen to that state (such is the mutability and vnconstancy of fortune, which turneth all things vpside downe) that there is no part of it but either it is subiect to the Turke and enthralled to his slauish seruitude, or els it is vnder the command of the Venetians, or tributary to them. The Turke possesseth the greater part: the Venetians do only enioy certaine ilands in that sea. Those which are vnder the Venetian gouernment are in better state, in respect of Religion, than those which are subiect to the Turke. Those which are vnder the obedience of the Turke, do conforme themselues to their maners, as likewise those which are commanded of the Venetians; doe imitate the behauiour of the Venetians. Yet all of them do liue in such great darkenesse of ignorant blindnesse, that in all <HI>Greece</HI> now there is not one Vniuersity or schoole of liberall sciences: neither are they desirous to haue their chil∣dren taught so much as to write and read. And all of them generally do speake their ancient language, but much cor∣rupted, although some of them do speake more purely then others. Yet their moderne language doth come more neere to the old Greeke, then the Italian to the Roman or Latin tongue. Those which dwell in cities subiect to the Venetian iurisdiction, do speake Greeke and Italian: but the country people only Greeke: those which dwell in cities comman∣ded by the Turke, do speake Greeke and the Turkish tongues; those in the villages and vpland places, only Greeke. They haue also at this day, as (also they had in former ages) diuers and different dialects; for the people of one prouince do speake more pure; they of another shire more barbarously and rudely: whereupon that happeneth to this country, which is incident to other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that one doth mocke and scoffe anothers pronunciation, which to his eares seemeth rude and clownish: so that the Boies of <HI>Constantinople</HI> do mocke and laugh at the forreners; for their pronun∣ciation and diuers accenting of words different from them. Much like as the Italian, which speaketh the Tuscane: or the French which speaketh French: or the Spaniard, which speaketh the Castillian languages, do flout and hisse at those which are brought vp in other countries of the same kingdomes.</P>
<P>But that we may set out in the best maner the whole course of life of this nation, I thinke it necessary to distinguish the Nobility and citizens from the common people and baser sort of men: for they which are of greater reuenews and of better credit, do vse the habit and fashion of apparell of those Princes to whom they are subiect, so that those which are gouerned by the Venetians, do imitate the Venetians: those that are subiect to the Turke, the Turkes. But the com∣mon people vnder whose iurisdiction so euer, aswell within the maine land, as the ilanders, do yet retaine something of the old customes of the Greeks: for, for the most part all of them do weare the haire of their head long behind, and short before: and do vse great double cappes. The Ilanders in the forme of diuine seruice, all of them both in rites and ceremonies, aswell as in Ecclesiasticall gouernment, do not any whit vary one from another. All the Greeks general∣ly, after the Turkes maner, haue not much houshold stuffe, neither do they lie vpon feather-beds, but in steed of them they vse certaine pillowes, stuffed with flocks or wooll. All of them do hate delaied wine, that is, wine mingled with water, and to this day they keepe their old custome of carousing and liberall kind of drinking, especially the Creets. Yet in this they differ from the Germanes; in that these prouoke one another to drinke whole cuppes, those do sippe and drinke, smaller draughts. Whereupon <HI>Graecari,</HI> was then (and now still is) vsed, for <HI>Inebriari,</HI> to be drunken. But because that in drinking they vse certaine lawes or ceremonies, I cannot passe them ouer with silence. First, their tables are very low, and they drinke by turnes, no man euer skipping his course: so that if any man shall call for wine out of order, that is, before his turne come about, it is held for a very vnmannerly part. He that can fill wine best, holdeth the wine potte, and he alone filleth out for the rest in order as it commeth to their course. In those their drinkings they vse a certaine little kind of glasse without a foote, so that it cannot be set downe but euery man must drinke all out, and may not leaue one drop in the glasse. Sometime they challenge one another to drinke after the Dutch fashion, and then they embrace one another, and hold hands, and one kisseth the hand of him to whom he drinketh, and first layeth it vpon his forehead, then he stroaketh and kisseth both his cheeks: but in this kind of drinking they obserue no order as afore. And because they drinke a very strong wine, and that in small draughts, and so do heate themselues very much, they haue alwaies by them a great tankerd full of water, whereof they drinke euery foote large draughts to coole them∣selues againe: for otherwise they should scarsely be able to alay their thirst. No women may be present at their drinke∣ings. The old custome vsed of the heathen of mourning for the dead, is still obserued at this day all ouer <HI>Greece,</HI> and countries neere adioining: which is a very foolish maner: for as soone as one is dead, the women meet together in a certaine place; and at the breake of day they begin a kind of lamentation or howling, striking their breasts, tearing their cheekes, twiching and pulling their haire, they keep a pitifull and ruefull adoe to see to. And that these ceremonies may be done more solemnely, they hire one woman aboue the rest with a most shrill loud voice, to lead the rest and guide their voices, that their rests, or pauses as they call them, and the accents may better be distinguished: and in this mourn∣full song they set out the praises and vertuous qualities of the party deceassed, from his cradle euen to the last houre of his death. &amp;c. These we haue taken out of the first booke of <HI>P. Bellonius</HI> his obseruations, where thou maiest see many things more worth the noting.</P>
<P>Amongst the old writers, <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> described this country, but <HI>Pausanias</HI> more curiously and with greater di∣ligence. Of the latter, <HI>Nicolas Gerbelius</HI> and <HI>Wolfangus Lazius;</HI> who also citeth one <HI>Antony Vrantz</HI> Bishop of <HI>Agria,</HI> who had trauailled it all ouer, and hath lately set out a more late description of the same, with the moderne names and appellations of places. To these you may adde the <HI>Hodoeporicum Byzantium Hugonis Fauolij,</HI> and the Orientall obser∣uations of <HI>S. Nicolaij, Andrew Theuet, Peter Bellone</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Peter Gill</HI> hath most exactly described <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> (the Latines call it <HI>Stretto di Constantinopoli;</HI> the Greekes now, <HI>Laimon;</HI> the Turkes, <HI>Bagazin</HI>) and the city <HI>Constantinople.

<HEAD>ILLYRICVM.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Llyricum,</HI> or, (which pleaseth others better) <HI>Illyris,</HI> is a country vpon the coast of the Hadri∣aticke sea, opposite to <HI>Italy.</HI> The bounds of this prouince according to diuers authours, are diuers. For <HI>Pliny</HI> doth assigne it but a narrow roome between the riuers <HI>Arsia</HI> and <HI>Titius.</HI> And <HI>Ptolemey</HI> he extendeth the confines of it as farre, namely from <HI>Histria,</HI> vp as high as <HI>Macedonia,</HI> all along by the sea coast: and his vpland or more inner parts, he maketh to reach euen vnto the skirts of <HI>Pannonia</HI> and <HI>Moesia</HI> the higher. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> and <HI>Dionysius Ale∣xandrinus</HI> do yet make it farre greater, ascribing to <HI>Illyricum</HI> all that tract of the Hadriaticke sea that is between <HI>Tergestum</HI> and <HI>Montes Ceraunij,</HI> and affirmeth withall that the <HI>Illyrij</HI> do dwell beyond the riuer <HI>Danaw.</HI> For <HI>Mela</HI> doth account the riuer <HI>Danaw</HI> amongst the riuers of <HI>Illyricum. Strabo</HI> also in his seuenth booke of his Geography, saith that the <HI>Illyrij,</HI> do border vpon <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thracia.</HI> But <HI>Appianus Alexandrinus</HI> doth yet make it more large then any of those for∣mer writers: for thus he writeth of the <HI>Illyrij.</HI> The Greeks, saith he, do call all those <HI>Illyrij,</HI> which dwell between <HI>Chao∣nia,</HI> and <HI>Thesprotis,</HI> (beyond <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thracia</HI>) vp as high as the riuer <HI>Ister:</HI> for this is the length of this prouince. The breadth of it is the space betwixt <HI>Macedonia</HI> and the mountaines of <HI>Thrace,</HI> euen vnto <HI>Paeonia</HI> and the Ionian sea, and so butteh vpon the Alpes, which is about fiue daies iournies length. His length is thrise as great as the breadth &amp;c. And a little after, the same authour hath these words: The Romans do generally comprehend vnder that of the <HI>Illyrij,</HI> not only those before cited, but also the <HI>Paeones</HI> beyond them, together with the <HI>Rhoeti, Norici,</HI> and <HI>Mysij</HI> which inha∣bit <HI>Europe,</HI> and whatsoeuer Nations els do border vpon these, which they leaue vpon the right hand that saile vp the riuer <HI>Ister:</HI> and againe that they may distinguish the Hellines from the Greekes, they call them by their seuerall and proper names: otherwise generally they are by one name called <HI>Illyrij:</HI> For euen from the head of the riuer <HI>Ister</HI> vnto the Ponticke sea, they commonly terme them <HI>Illyrici.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Appianus. Suetonius,</HI> in the life of <HI>Tiberius Caesar</HI> te∣stifieth in like maner that the bounds of <HI>Illyricum</HI> are thus large at the left.</P>
<P><HI>Sextus Rufus,</HI> who liued in the time of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the Emperour, ascribeth seuenteen prouinces to <HI>Illyricum:</HI> Two of the <HI>Norici,</HI> the two <HI>Pannonies, Valeria, Sauia, Dalmatia, Moesia,</HI> the two <HI>Dacias, Macedonia, Thessalia, Achaia,</HI> two <HI>Epirus, Praeualis</HI> and <HI>Creta.</HI></P>
<P>Some do thinke that these countries were so named of <HI>Illyrius</HI> the sonne of <HI>Polyphemus:</HI> others of <HI>Illyrius</HI> the sonne of <HI>Cadmus. Strabo</HI> writeth that all the sea coast of <HI>Illyricum,</HI> with the ilands adioining, is furnished with many good ha∣uens: when as contrariwise the whole coast of <HI>Italie</HI> ouer against this, hath none at all. It is a hot country, as <HI>Italy</HI> is, and very fertile of many sorts of graine, famous for oliues and vines: except certaine places which are altogether rough and vntoiled. The high country which is aboue this is altogether mountainous, cold and snowie, especially that which is toward the North. The country people in old time were much giuen to robberies and theeuing, but now they be somewhat more ciuill. They dwell for the most part in houses of timber, thatcht with straw, excepting only a few marine cities, in which their buildings are a little better. Thus farre <HI>Strabo.</HI> Amongst the which the chiefe is <HI>Ragusi,</HI> anciently called <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> a city famous for the Mart, aswell as for the politicke gouernment of their common-wealth. Not long since it was a free city, now it is tributary to the Turkes, and for that (as <HI>Nicolaus Nicolaius</HI> witnesseth in his Obseruations) it paieth yearely to the great Turke 12000. ducates of Gold. A description of this you may read of in the tenth booke of <HI>Martin Barlet</HI> of the life of <HI>Scanderbeg.</HI></P>
<P>Thus farre generally of <HI>Illyricum:</HI> now I thinke it not amisse to speake something of this our Mappe which doth not comprehend all <HI>Illyricum</HI> according to the iudgement of the forenamed authours, <HI>Pliny</HI> only excepted who doth restraine the bounds of it, as we said, into a more narrow roome. There are in this Chart <HI>Histria, Slauonia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Carinthia,</HI> part of <HI>Carniola,</HI> and part of <HI>Stiria:</HI> all almost tributary vnto the kingdome of <HI>Hungary,</HI> except a few prouinces abuttant vpon the sea, which belong to the Venetians. The Turke hath subdued the greatest part of them to his obedience. All which countries almost are described in their seuerall Tables in this our Theater, and therefore in this place we speake nothing at all of them. Only I thinke it not amisse to adde this one story of <HI>Stiria,</HI> That this country doth breed those <HI>Strumosi,</HI> that is, a kind of people subiect to wennes, and that there are often seene some with such huge great wennes, that they do hinder their speach: and a woman giuing sucke (as <HI>Aubanus</HI> writeth) doth cast it ouer her shoulder like a sacke or wallet, least it should let the child from taking the breast. And indeed we in the yeare 1558. iournied from <HI>Frisach</HI> by <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Venice,</HI> where we saw to our great admiration, a man whose chin beginning at his eares was almost as broade as from shoulder to shoulder, and hung downe euen to his breast. I say, not without great admiration, against that of <HI>Inuenall, Quis tumidum guttur miretur in Alpibus?</HI> It is no wonder great, to see the wenne amongst the Alpes. They commonly attribute the cause of the wenne to the water and aire which heere the inhabitants do vse, and draw into their bodies. <HI>Rithmaimer</HI> this country-man borne, in his treatise of the situation of the World, hath a peculiar description of <HI>Stiria.</HI> Of <HI>Bosina</HI> read <HI>D. Chytraeus</HI> his Chronicle of <HI>Saxony.</HI> Of these Illyrians read more at large in <HI>Dominicus Niger, Volaterran,</HI> and <HI>Lewis Verger</HI> in the Cosmography of <HI>Sebasti∣an Munster,</HI> as also <HI>Laonicus Chalcondylas,</HI> who in his tenth booke <HI>Notiliar,</HI> hath written something of this countrie worth the reading. All this tract, except those shires which border vpon <HI>Germanie,</HI> doth speake the Slauonian tongue: which, (that I may say something of it by the way) of some is now called <HI>Windish,</HI> was thought to be that, which the Latines called <HI>Lingua Illyrica,</HI> the Illyrian tongue, and at this day is very farre spread, as being generally spo∣ken of all the nations inhabiting between the Gulfe of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the North sea. For the inhabitants of <HI>Istria, Dal∣matia, Bosna, Morauia, Bohemia, Lusatia, Polonia, Lithuania, Pruthenia, Scandinauia, Bulgaria,</HI> and <HI>Russia</HI> that wide and large kingdome, and many other neighbour counrries, vp as high almost as <HI>Constantinople</HI> do speake that tongue; so that it is also much vsed amongst the Turkes:</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Had purposed, as I promised in the Preface to this booke, to haue set out of euery country but one Mappe or Table: and that as exact as might be: therefore when the famous man <HI>Iohannes Sambucus</HI> had sent vnto me a more absolute description of this country to be inserted into this our Theater, I had determined to haue left the other out. But as it is oft times both delightfull and pro∣fitable to know diuers opinions of one and the same thing, so also I perswade my selfe, it will not be altogether vnprofitable sometime to see the different descriptions of sundry authours of one and the same countrie. Againe lest the studious and diligent Reader should misse in this our last edition, that which was to be had in our first, we haue thought good to reteine also aswell the one as the other: and to place it heere in this place as an in-come or by-matter.

<HEAD>The Dukedome of CARINTHIA, or KARNTEN, and the County Palatine of GORCZ.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Dukedome of <HI>Carinthia,</HI> (which as <HI>Rithmayer</HI> affirmeth should rather be written <HI>Carnithia</HI>) hath vpon the East and North <HI>Steyrmarcke,</HI> vpon the West and South the Alpes and <HI>Friuli. Carniola</HI> is part of this prouince. In this country are many valleies and hilles very good wheat grounds: many Lakes and Riuers; amongst the which the chiefe is <HI>Drauus,</HI> or as they now call it <HI>Dra.</HI> The more fa∣mous cities of this tract are, <HI>S. Veit, Villach,</HI> and <HI>Clagenfurt. S. Veit</HI> the Metropolitane city, is a city of good note, hauing a very faire large market place, wherein standeth a goodly conduite of running wa∣ter, which we saw in building in the yeare 1558. The diameter or breadth of the cesterne we tooke to be about seuen foote ouer. This cesterne made of one whole stone of white marble, and there a∣mongst other monuments of antiquity digged out of the ground, was a thing worth the seeing. As they go out of the city toward <HI>Clagen-furt,</HI> there is a very wide champion that offereth it selfe, as yet bestrewed with many ruines of ancient buildings, they commonly call it <HI>Solfeldt: Paracelsus</HI> in that his Chronicle of this coun∣try (if so be it be his) nameth it, I cannot tell vpon what ground, <HI>Liburnia.</HI> I do rather iudge <HI>Soluense oppidum,</HI> the towne <HI>Solue,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> maketh mention of in <HI>Carina,</HI> to haue long since stood heere. This is that place, where the princes are wont to be crowned abroad in the open aire, a strange and vnusuall kind of ceremony curiously described by <HI>Pius</HI> the second, in his <HI>Europa. Villach,</HI> a towne, whose houses in their forefront gorgeously painted and set out with histories and variety of colours yeeld a beau∣tifull and goodly shew to the beholders. It is seated vpon the riuer <HI>Dra,</HI> in a plaine, enclosed with very high steepe rocks, with a great stone bridge ouer the riuer. <HI>Clagen-furt,</HI> a strong city anciently called, as <HI>Lazius</HI> witnesseth, <HI>Claudia.</HI> Some there are that write, that the citizens of this city are so hardly bent against theeues, that vpon the least occasion of suspicion of theft a man shall there without examination be hanged, and then the third day after that he is hanged, they sitte vpon the triall; if so be that they find him to haue been vniustly executed, they bury him very honourably: if iustly, they let him hang still. But <HI>Rithmayer</HI> saith, that this is but a meere fable. Moreouer <HI>Frisach,</HI> a very ancient towne <HI>S. Lionhart, Wolfsperg, &amp;c.</HI> are townes also of this coun∣try. In former times the <HI>Iapydes</HI> were thought to haue dwelt heere abouts. The soueraignty and secular iurisdiction of this coun∣try doth belong vnto the Dukes of <HI>Austrich:</HI> but as concerning Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction it partly belongeth to the Bishop of <HI>Salczburg,</HI> and partly to the Patriarch of <HI>Aquileia,</HI> as <HI>Paracelsus</HI> affirmeth in his forecited Chronicle. But in the same place he hath a most ridiculous etymologie of the name of this prouince, which he faineth to be fetched from the Latines, namely, that it should be named <HI>Carinthia,</HI> as who would say, <HI>Caritas intima,</HI> Intire loue and affection. As if the first inhabitants who seated themselues heere should haue been desirous to haue their country named by a name fetcht from a forrein nation and strange lan∣guage, not vnderstood of them.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is almost a common thing generally (as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith in his naturall historie) that euery man describeth best and most curiously that country, in which he was borne and brought vp. And within a few lines after the same authour saith thus; I will follow no one man altogether, but as I shall find him in all points to speake most probably and consonant to the truth. And therefore heere in this place (the which I do almost euery where in these discourses vpon my Maps) I haue determined, amongst many others that haue described this prouince, to offer to the view of the Reader a great description according to the capacity of the place, of <HI>Lewis Verger,</HI> that country man borne. This man in the Cosmography of <HI>Munster,</HI> saith that this Neckland or De∣mi-ile, from the inner bay where <HI>Trieste</HI> now standeth hard vpon the shore, vnto the <HI>S. Veit,</HI> a towne situate in <HI>Fanatico</HI> vpon the riuer <HI>Fiume,</HI> conteineth in length better then 200. miles. The whole country is not very leuell and plaine, yet the mountaines are neither very high, steep nor barren, but plentifully replenished with vines, oliues, and other fruit-trees, corne, pastures and cattell: only in that part which bendeth toward the bay, <HI>Golfo di Quernero,</HI> sometime called <HI>Flanatico</HI> or <HI>Fanatico,</HI> it hath a very high mountaine, which they commonly call <HI>Monte maior.</HI> This first presenteth it selfe to the eie of the seamen which saile hither∣ward; in whose toppe there ariseth a very goodly spring of fresh-water. It yeeldeth many rare hearbs and plants of singular ver∣tues, which do make Physitions, farre dwellers from hence, to resort hither in time of the yeare, and with great toile and danger to clamber vp the same. The riuers of <HI>Histria</HI> are three, <HI>Fornio, Naupertus</HI> and <HI>Arsia:</HI> the first the country people call <HI>Risano:</HI> the second, <HI>Quieto:</HI> the last <HI>Arsa,</HI> which falleth into the bay <HI>Quernero</HI> or <HI>Fanatico,</HI> and is now the vtmost bound of <HI>Italie.</HI> The ci∣ties of <HI>Histria</HI> are <HI>Mugia, Iustinopolis, Isola, Pitano,</HI> (or <HI>Piran</HI> as I thinke it is named in the mappe) <HI>Pumago, Hemonia, Parenzo, O∣sara, Rubino, Pola, S.

Vincenzo, Val Adignano, Pamerano, Albona, Fianonae, Petina, Galigagna, Coslaco,</HI> and <HI>Pisino,</HI> are vpland cities. The most fa∣mous city of this whole country is <HI>Iustinopolis,</HI> which they commonly call <HI>Capo d' Istria,</HI> the head of <HI>Histria, Pliny</HI> nameth it <HI>Ae∣gida:</HI> it standeth vpon a rocke in the sea, farre remote from the continent, vnto which it is ioined by a long bridge. This city with many other is subiect vnto the Venetians, the rest are vnder the gouernment of the Duke of <HI>Austrich &amp;c.</HI> Beside the ancient Ge∣ographers read also <HI>Leander, Volaterran,</HI> and <HI>Dom.

Donaw (Danubius)</HI> of all the riuers of <HI>Europe</HI> by farre the greatest, run∣neth through the middest of it, and so diuideth it into two parts, the Heather and the Farder. The HEATHER HVNGARIA, is that which formerly were the Pannonies, the Vpper and Neather: this is seuered from the further <HI>Hungaria</HI> by the riuer <HI>Dra:</HI> from <HI>Austrich</HI> and <HI>Bayern,</HI> by the foote of the mount <HI>Caecius;</HI> from <HI>Slauonia</HI> by <HI>Dra:</HI> from <HI>Bosna</HI> and <HI>Rascia,</HI> by <HI>Saw.</HI> The head and chiefe cities of this part is <HI>Buda,</HI> (often they call it) the imperiall seat of their kings. Other townes of great account are, <HI>Alba Regalis, (Stulweissenburg)</HI> famous for the coronation and tombes of their kings; <HI>Strigonium, (Gran)</HI> the Metropolitan or Archbishops sea, <HI>Quinqueecclesiae (Funskirchen,</HI> the Turkes call it <HI>Petscheu)</HI> a bishop∣ricke; <HI>Sopronium, Taurunum</HI> (the Germanes call it <HI>Griechweissenburg,</HI> the Hungarians, <HI>Nandor alba;</HI> the Ita∣lians <HI>Belgrado:) Sabaria, (Zombatel)</HI> or <HI>Szombath hely</HI>) the place where S. <HI>Martine</HI> was borne: and <HI>Stridon, (Sdrigna,)</HI> the natiue soile of S. <HI>Hierome.</HI> It hath many goodly riuers; and two very famous lakes, <HI>(Ba∣laton)</HI> and <HI>(Fertou).</HI> To this part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> as soone as thou art ouer the riuer <HI>Dra,</HI> is annexed <HI>Slauonia,</HI> sometime a part of the vpper <HI>Pannonie,</HI> lying between the riuers <HI>Saw</HI> and <HI>Dra;</HI> although indeed it doth extend it selfe farre beyond the <HI>Saw,</HI> as farre as the riuer <HI>Huna,</HI> (for so it is at this day called) where <HI>Cro∣atia</HI> beginneth. After it followeth <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> coasting along by the Hadriaticke sea, partly subiect to the Turke, partly to the Venetian. The least part of it now is vnder the king of <HI>Hungaria:</HI> the vpland country is possessed of the <HI>Bozners,</HI> and <HI>Rascians,</HI> which anciently were called <HI>Moesi superiores.</HI> The chiefe city of <HI>Slauonia</HI> is <HI>(Zagrabia)</HI> of <HI>Croatia, (Bigihon)</HI> is now, but in former ages <HI>Fumium</HI> was the chiefe. The FARTHER HVNGARY, or <HI>Hungary</HI> beyond <HI>Donaw,</HI> is seuered from <HI>Morauia, Silesia, Polonia,</HI> and <HI>Ruscia</HI> by the <HI>montes Carpathij,</HI> (called now by the Germanes <HI>(Schneberg)</HI> which do begin a little aboue <HI>Posonium, (Presburgh)</HI> and from thence by many long and tedious windings, passe between this coun∣try vntill they end at the <HI>Euxine</HI> sea or <HI>Marmaiore,</HI> at that place where there is the country which now they call <HI>Maromarusia.</HI> There now other mountaines and woods, from that place bending toward <HI>Se∣uerinum,</HI> a city situate vpon <HI>Donaw,</HI> do diuide it from <HI>Transsyluania</HI> and <HI>VValachria transalpina.</HI> The riuer <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> well stored with diuers sorts of fish, arising out of the mountaines of <HI>Maromarusia,</HI> runneth through the middest part of <HI>Hungary.</HI> It hath many goodly townes, as <HI>Posonium, (Presburg) Tirnauia, (Dijru) &amp;c.</HI> on the West: <HI>Colacia, Bachia, Zegedinum, (Zeged,) &amp;c.</HI> on the South: <HI>Varadinum, Dedrecinum, &amp;c.</HI> beyond the riuer <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> where also are the mines of gold and siluer; At <HI>Seuerinum,</HI> is yet to be seen a mention of the bridge, long since built by <HI>Traiane</HI> the Emperour, and other townes and things worth the remembrance, which in this place, the shortnesse of our entended discourse doth force me to omit.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants do speake the Scythian language, a tongue much different from any language spoken by any of their neighbours round about them. It giueth place to no country of the World, for valiant and stout men; store of cattell, fertility of soile, and rich veines of mettalls: but for tempera∣ture of the aire, wholesome and pleasant situation, it may iustly be preferred before any whatsoeuer that I know. The earth is plentifully endowed by nature with all maner of things necessary and com∣modious: Gold, Siluer, Salt, Precious-stones, Mineralls for colours are heere digged vp in great abun∣dance. It yeeldeth great store of corne, graine, fodder for cattell, apples and fruites of diuers sorts. They haue many riuers well stored with fresh fish. They haue great plenty of Coppar. In the most of their riuers there are often found certaine shiuers of the best and finest gold: yea euen in their vines, (such is the nature of this golden soile) they do extract great plenty of Gold.</P>
<P>This we haue gathered out of the little treatise of <HI>Steeuen Broderith,</HI> and the Decades of <HI>Hungary</HI> writ∣ten by <HI>Antony Bonfinius:</HI> to whom the studious Reader for further satisfaction may haue recourse. Let him also read <HI>Herberstein</HI> his Commentaries of <HI>Moscouy; Matthias</HI> a <HI>Michou</HI> of <HI>Sarmatia, Munster,</HI> and <HI>Cuspi∣nian in oratione Protreptica,</HI> and in his <HI>Austria:</HI> and especially the abridgement of the histories of <HI>Hungary</HI> written by <HI>Peter Ranzane,</HI> who, amongst other strange wonders which he reckoneth vp of this coun∣try, affirmeth, if you will beleeue him, that himselfe hath seen very many golden branches and twigs of vines, some as long as ones finger, others halfe a foote long. <HI>George VVernher</HI> hath written a little tract of the strange waters of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>

He that shall compare them one with the other, shall find oft times great variety in the situation of places, and turnings and windings of the streames and riuers: and yet there is no rea∣son why presently any man should condemne the authours of want of skill or diligence in describing it: but let him iudge of it, as <HI>Strabo</HI> most truely doth of History: for he doth not by and by thinke that history to be reiected, when they that haue set it forth, do not altogether agree in the descriptions of places: when as the truth of the whole history is many times by that disagreement more plainly demonstrated.

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Teuen Broderith,</HI> in his Treatise printed at <HI>Basill,</HI> together with the Hungarian hi∣story of <HI>Antony Bonfinius,</HI> describeth this country thus: <HI>Transsiluania,</HI> saith he, was sometime a part of <HI>Dacia.</HI> His chiefe city is <HI>Alba Iulia, (Weissenburg)</HI> so called ei∣ther of <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> or rather of <HI>Hiula</HI> a certaine prince of the Hunnes. It hath many other goodly townes, amongst the which are <HI>Cibinum, (Hermanstadt)</HI> called of the Hungarians <HI>(Seben)</HI> situate vpon the riuer <HI>Cibin, Brassouia, (Chronstadt) Co∣losium, (Clausenburg) Bistricia, (Bestereze)</HI> and many other built and inhabited by a people of high <HI>Germany,</HI> which we call Saxons. In this country are the <HI>Siculi,</HI> a fierce and warlike Nation: amongst which there is neither clowne, nor gentleman, all men are in de∣gree equall, like as amongst the Switzers <HI>Transsiluania</HI> is very fertile of all maner of things, especially of Gold, Siluer, and other mettalls; as also of Salt digged out of mountaines. It breedeth excellent Hor∣ses, and hath great plenty of Wine, although not so good as <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Slauonia.</HI> The two Walachies <HI>VValachia Transalpina, Walachie</HI> beyond the mountaines, and <HI>Moldauia,</HI> do enclose <HI>Transsiluania:</HI> that rest∣eth vpon the riuer <HI>Donaw,</HI> this vpon the Euxine sea, or <HI>Mar maiore,</HI> as the Italians call it; both of them together with <HI>Transsiluania</HI> do now possesse that part of <HI>Europe,</HI> which anciently was called DACIA. Thus that whole tract beyond <HI>Donaw,</HI> which doth not only conteine the higher <HI>Hungary,</HI> but also <HI>Transsiluania</HI> together with both the Walachies, is enclosed round on euery side with <HI>Donaw,</HI> the Car∣pathian hills, (<HI>Crapacke,</HI> as some thinke) the Euxine sea, and againe with the same <HI>Donaw.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Broderith.</HI></P>
<P>But I thinke it not amisse to set downe heere the description of it out of <HI>Antony Bonfinius</HI> his I. decade of the first booke of his history of <HI>Hungary.</HI> Beyond the Carpathian mountaines, saith he, is the vtter∣most prouince of <HI>Dacia,</HI> extended euen vnto the riuer <HI>Axiaces.</HI> This now vulgarly is knowen by the name of TRANSSILVANIA, they call it <HI>Sibenburghen,</HI> the Hungarians <HI>Herdel.</HI> It is a most fertile coun∣try of cattell, wine, and corne: also of Gold and Siluer: where certaine riuers do driue downe shiuers of Gold, and pieces sometime of a pound and an halfe weight; being euery way round beset with steep hills in maner of a crownet. In the woods are kine or beeues with long manes like horses; buffs and wild horses, both very swift and light in running: but the horses haue long manes hanging down to the very ground: those which are tame and brought vp for seruice, naturally haue a very fine easie kind of amble. This country is inhabited partly by Scythians, partly by the Saxones and Dakes: these are more humane and ciuill, those more rude and churlish. In old time before the breaking in of the Gothes and Hunnes, all <HI>Dacia</HI> was possessed by the Roman and Sarmatian colonies, <HI>&amp;c. George</HI> of <HI>Reichtersdorff</HI> hath described this country in a peculiar Treatise. See also <HI>George Rithaymer, Peter Rantzan, Pius</HI> the second in his description of <HI>Europe, Iohn Auentine,</HI> and <HI>Martine Cromer</HI> in his twelfth booke of the history of <HI>Poland.</HI> This country vulgarly is called <HI>Sibenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Zipserland,</HI> as <HI>Sebastian Munster</HI> hath giuen out. More of the knowledge and discouery of this prouince are to be sought for, in the first chapter and second section of the twelfth booke of <HI>Wolfangus Lazius</HI> his Romane common-wealth, and in <HI>Laonicus</HI> his fifth booke: Lastly, in the protrepticke oration of <HI>Iohn Cuspinian.</HI></P>

The common drinke the people vse is Beere: wine they seldome drinke, neither do they know how to dresse and manure the vine. They are counted excellent Horsemen for seruice in the warres. The soile is fertile, they haue many heards of cattell, many deere, game and pastime for the Noblemen. It hath great plenty of Hony. Salt heere is digged out of the earth in great abundance. In the mountaines which they in their language call <HI>Tatri,</HI> they haue mines of Brasse and Brimstone. <HI>Cromer</HI> writeth, that the Polanders are of the Hungars called <HI>Lengel,</HI> of <HI>Leech</HI> the captaine or father of the Nation.</P>
<P>Vnder the kingdome of <HI>Polonia</HI> are comprehended <HI>Lithuania, Samogitia, Masouia, Volhinia, Podolia</HI> and <HI>Russia,</HI> which is called <HI>South-Russia,</HI> and of some <HI>Ruthenia:</HI> as also all <HI>Prussia,</HI> except that part which hath a peculiar Duke by whom it is gouerned. <HI>Lewenclay</HI> writeth that in the yeare 1570. the king of <HI>Poland</HI> tooke the Prince of <HI>Moldauia</HI> to his protection.</P>
<P>The greatest part of LITHVANIA, is moorish and full of Bogges, for the most part woody, and therefore not easilie entered, trauelled or come vnto; it is better trading with the Lithuans in the winter then at other times: for that the moores and lakes being couered either with thicke ice or deep snow, the Marchants may passe from place to place more easily. In <HI>Lithuania</HI> there are few townes, and the villages are little inhabited. The chiefe wealth of the country people are cattell and rich skins of diuers sorts of wild beasts, wherewith the whole country is wonderfully stored. They haue great plenty of wax and hony. This prouince breedeth the <HI>Bugle,</HI> a kind of beast which they call <HI>Suber,</HI> the Germanes <HI>Vr-ochs,</HI> such as was to be seene at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> in the yeare 1570. From hence also commeth that kind of beast which the Latines call <HI>Alces,</HI> the Dutch <HI>Elandt.</HI> The people speake the Slauonian tongue, like as also the Polanders do. Their chiefe city is <HI>Vilna,</HI> a Bishop sea, and is as bigge as <HI>Cracow:</HI> but the houses in it do not stand close together or touch one another: but like as in the country, gardens and orchyeards are between house and house. All that Oke-timber which we call <HI>Wagenschott,</HI> of which almost all the buildings carpenters worke, and ioiners worke, as well publicke as priuate, is made in the Low-countries, as also the greatest part of their furniture and houshold-stuffe, is feld in these parts, and from thence is through the East sea, (the Latines call it <HI>Mare balticum,</HI> the Dutch <HI>Oostsee,</HI> the Russians <HI>Wareczkouie mo∣rie</HI>) and Germane ocean, transported into these countries.</P>
<P>In SAMOGITIA, (which in their language signifieth <HI>Low-land</HI>) the people are tall and of a goodly stature, but rude and barbarous in their maners and behauiour, vsing a sparing and homely diet. The Russians call this prouince <HI>Samotz∣kasemla.</HI> Heere is no maner of faire buildings, but their houses are like houels or poore cottages; made of wood and couered with straw or reed. From the bottome vpward by a little and little their buildings are made lesse and lesse, like the keele of a ship, or great helmet. In the toppe it hath one window, letting in the light from aboue, vnderneath which is the hearth or chimney where they dresse their meat. In that house they hide themselues, their wiues, children, ser∣uants, maides, sheep, cattell, corne and houshold-stuffe altogether. <HI>Sichardus</HI> in his history of <HI>Germany</HI> writeth that the people of <HI>Samogitia</HI> are descended from the Saxons: and therefore although they be subiect to the kingdome of <HI>Polonia,</HI> yet the Saxons challenging it to be a part of their iurisdiction, they do affirme it to pertaine to the precinct of <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>MASOVIA, is a shire held of the king of <HI>Poland,</HI> in homage. The chiefe or Metropolitane city of this prouince is <HI>War∣souia,</HI> where they make the excellent mead, a kind of drinke made of hony &amp;c.</P>
<P>VOLHINIA, a country abounding with all maner of things, a very fertile soile, full of townes and castles.</P>
<P>PODOLIA, is of such a fruitfull soile, that the grasse in three daies will couer a sticke being cast into it. It is so ranke and groweth so fast, that a plough, being left in it vpon the head-lands or grassie places of the field, in a very few daies, wilbe so couered ouer that you shall hardly find it againe. Heere also is great store of hony. The head city is <HI>Camyenetz.</HI></P>
<P>RVSSIA, yeeldeth great plenty of Horses, Oxen, and Sheep of very fine wooll. Their drinke is mead, which they make of hony. Wine also is brought hither from <HI>Pannonia, Moldauia</HI> and <HI>Walachria.</HI> The chiefe city of this prouince is <HI>Leunpurg,</HI> the Latines call it <HI>Leopolis,</HI> Lion-city,</P>
<P>MOLDAVIA is a part of <HI>Walachia,</HI> whose metropolitane city is <HI>Sossouia,</HI> commonly called <HI>Sotschen.</HI> The inhabitants of this country are a fierce and cruell people, but very good souldiours, and therefore they are at continuall enmity with the Transsiluanians. As the custome of the Thracians was in old time to marke the Noblemens children with a hot iron: so they report that the Lords of <HI>Moldauia</HI> to this day do vse, to marke their children, assoone as they be borne, with some kind of marke: least a question might arise whether they were the right and lawfull heires or not: and that aliens and strangers might be excluded from inheritance amongst them; as <HI>Reinerus Reineckius</HI> in his discourse of noble families hath written. Many other things of thse countries thou maiest read of in <HI>Matthias</HI> of <HI>Michow</HI> in his discourse of the Sar∣maties, <HI>Albert Crantz</HI> in his description of <HI>Wandalia, Bonfinius</HI> in his history of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Laonicus Chalcondylas</HI> in his first and third bookes. But of all <HI>Martine Cromer</HI> in his Chronicle of <HI>Poland</HI> hath most excellently described these countries, and <HI>Sigismund</HI> of <HI>Herberstain</HI> in his commentaries of <HI>Moschouia.</HI> See also <HI>Sebastian Munster, Pius Secundus</HI> Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Dauid Chytraeus</HI> in his Chronicle of <HI>Saxony. Iohannes Duglossus,</HI> a most copious historian of the Po∣lonians, is cited by <HI>Ioach mus Cureus;</HI> but as yet not published, as he affirmeth. <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Reichersdorff</HI> hath most curi∣ously described <HI>Moldauia. Laonicus Chalcondylas</HI> also in his second booke hath diuers things worth the knowing of this country.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Romer</HI> in his description of <HI>Poland,</HI> describeth this country on this maner: Amongst many other nations of <HI>Sarmatia</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Borussi</HI> by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> are placed very farre North in that coast, where now, as I thinke, the Liuonians and Moschouites do dwell, beyond the riuer <HI>Chernish,</HI> next neighbours to the Ryphaeans. Those, with <HI>Erasmus stella</HI> I iudge, to haue passed further South and West and possessed a great part of <HI>Sar∣matia,</HI> which is vpon the East adioined to the Russians and Moschouites, and is enclosed on the South with woods and the Hercynian forrest, and all that coast along by <HI>Pautzkerwicke</HI> or <HI>Frish-haff,</HI> as some thinke, (<HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth it <HI>Sinus Venedicus, Pliny Clylipenus</HI>) the Balticke, and East seas, euen vnto the riuers <HI>Vistula, (Wixel</HI> or <HI>Weissel</HI>) and <HI>Ossa;</HI> and to be called <HI>Borussi</HI> or <HI>Prussi,</HI> by names not much different. In this compasse now do inhabit the Liuonians, Lithuans, Samagites, and the Pruissen yet retaining the ancient appellation, nations distinct in respect that they are subiect to diuers states and gouerned by different lawes and policies, but vsing altogether the same language vulgarly, wholly differing from the Slauonians, yet hauing diuers Latine words intermedled and mixt among, but for the most part corrupt, and formed rather after the Italian and Spanish termination, than after the Latine. Notwithstanding the Dutch and Germanes of late yeares, conquering that part which lieth vpon the sea, and is cal∣led <HI>Spruisse</HI> and <HI>Liuonia,</HI> haue planted their colonies there. Heere hence it is that the Dutch tongue is more familiar and vsuall to these people, than that ancient and vulgar language, especially in the cities and townes. Which also is vsuall amongst the Lithuans, who by reason of their neighbourhood and entercourse with the Russians, and colonies from thence enterteined, do much what speake the Russian language. For in that <HI>Duglossus</HI> deriueth the name and originall of this nation from <HI>Prusias</HI> the king of <HI>Bithynia,</HI> it is altogether fabulous, and not worth the confuting. Some do thinke that the <HI>Borussi,</HI> in the German tongue were so called, for that they were neere the <HI>Russi:</HI> but whether truly, or fasly I list not heere to dispute. When and how the Latine tongue did intermedle it selfe with the vulgar language of the Borussians, Lithuanians, and Liuonians we dare not constantly affirme. <HI>Erasmus Stella</HI> saith, that <HI>Borussia, (Prussia,</HI> or <HI>Spruse</HI>) was rather assaulted by the Romanes, then conquered; and alleadgeth <HI>Pliny</HI> for his authour: whereupon that followeth that together with the Em∣pire, the Latine tongue could not there be spread and planted. But <HI>Duglossus</HI> he telleth vs, that in those ciuill warres between <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> a certaine band or company of Romanes, forsaking <HI>Italie,</HI> their natiue country in those troublesome times, seated themselues in these coasts, and to haue built a city there, and to haue called it ROMOVE, after the name of <HI>Rome</HI> their mother: which city for a long time was the Metropolitane of that country. If this opinion of <HI>Duglossus</HI> be true, who may iustly suspect, (alwaies reserued, if there be any cause of doubt of the truth of the history) that that band of Romanes, lead by some captaine named <HI>Libo,</HI> to haue come vnto the sea coast neere <HI>Frisch-haff,</HI> toward the East, and doth border vpon the Russians, driuen hither either by tempestuous weather to haue landed in this place, or being followed by the conquerours, to haue withdrawen themselues into these quarters for shelter against the raging tyranny of <HI>Caesars</HI> souldiers: and so the <HI>Libones, Liuones</HI> or <HI>Liuonians</HI> to haue receiued their name and appellation from the same <HI>Libo:</HI> Lastly entending their bounds further and spreading themselues euery way, some to haue been named <HI>Lithuanians,</HI> by a name deriued from the same, but much altered and corrupt, and others to haue retained still the ancient appellation of the <HI>Prussi.</HI> Notwithstanding also a great part of <HI>Pomerland,</HI> and <HI>Culmischland,</HI> and the skirts of <HI>Michelaw,</HI> after that they came to be subiect to the same iurisdiction with <HI>Spruse,</HI> and were vnder the command of the Knights of the <HI>Holy Crosse, (Teutones Crucigeri)</HI> began to be called by one name, <HI>Spruse:</HI> yet indeed, that is properlie and truly called <HI>Spruse,</HI> which is comprehended between the riuers <HI>Weissel, (Vistulo) Dribentz, Ossa,</HI> and <HI>Nemen,</HI> and the bay <HI>Frisch-haff,</HI> (which we spoke of before) and from <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Massouia</HI> is diuided by thicke woods full of Meeres and Bogges. Thus farre out of <HI>Cromer.</HI> I thinke it not amisse also to set down heere the ancient diuision of this country of <HI>Spruse</HI> into particular shires, as <HI>Casper Henne∣berger</HI> hath written, whose words are these.</P>
<P>VIDIVVTO, or, as he is called of some, VIDINITVS, king of <HI>Borussia,</HI> in the yeare of Christ 573. when he was 116. yeares old, be∣fore he together with his brother BRVTENOCRIBE, did cast himselfe, for a sacrifice to his Gods, into the fire, thus diuided his possessi∣ons vnto his sonnes. Hee had, as they report 12. sonnes. The I. was LITPHO, or as others call him LITALAN, to whom he gaue <HI>Lituania the Lower,</HI> &amp; made him king &amp; soueraigne of the rest, but he, for the murder of CRIBE, a Bishop of theirs so called, was reiected of his brethren. Amongst the other eleuen he diuided the country of <HI>Spruse.</HI> Of these the first called ZAMO, obtained that tract, which of him to this day is named <HI>Zambia, (Samland)</HI> hauing vpon the West &amp; North the salt sea; vpon the East the lake <HI>Curisch-haff, (Curonensis lacus)</HI> and the riuer <HI>Deme:</HI> vpon the South the riuer <HI>Pregel:</HI> it is a receiued opinion amongst them that he dwelt in the mount GALTAGARE. II. SVDO, got for his portion that part of the country where now are <HI>Oletzo, Stradaun, Lick.</HI> part of the precincts or liberties of <HI>Iohanisburg, Letzen, Angerburg</HI> and <HI>Insterburg:</HI> and hath vpon the East, <HI>Lituania:</HI> on the South, <HI>Masouia</HI> and <HI>Galindia:</HI> on the North-West, <HI>Barthonia, (Barthenerland)</HI> on the North, <HI>Schalauonia.</HI> This country they called, after his name, <HI>Sudauia.</HI> Which name afterward, when this whole tract was spoiled and laid wast by the <HI>Crucigeri</HI> (the knights of the <HI>Holy Crosse,</HI>) it vtterly lost: and therefore whether this country was called <HI>Sudauia,</HI> or not, the latter writers are wholly ignorant, and they do thinke it to haue beene in <HI>Sambia,</HI> where now is the canton called <HI>Der Sudawische winkel oder der Bruster ort,</HI> but they are deceiued: For for their treachery they were of the <HI>Crucigeri</HI> translated thither. III. NADROO, was seated between <HI>Sambia, Scalauonia,</HI> and <HI>Barthonia,</HI> where there are many riuers, forrests, and vast wildernesses, and is called <HI>Nadraw,</HI> (NADRAVIA.) In this prouince are <HI>Tapiaw, Taplaucken, Salaw, Georgenburg &amp;c.</HI> strong and defensible castels. IIII. SCALAVONI, had those places giuen him which are on either side of the riuer <HI>Memel,</HI> (the old writers called it <HI>Cronon</HI>) and therefore his portion was na∣med, <HI>Scalauonia,</HI> after his own name. V. NATANGO, got that part which of him was called <HI>Natangen,</HI> and hath vpon his North side the riuer <HI>Pregel,</HI> vpon the East, <HI>Alla.</HI> VI. BARTHO, enioyed <HI>Barthonia, <HI>Barthenerland.</HI></HI> It was diuided into the Greater, the Lesser, and <HI>Plick Barthen;</HI> but now those diuisions are forgotten and out of vse. VII. GALINDO, that tract from <HI>Masouia,</HI> vnto the riuer <HI>Alla,</HI> and the lake <HI>Spirding,</HI> of him was named <HI>Galindia,</HI> and conteineth many huge deserts: a great part of it doth belong to the Bishop of <HI>Var∣mia,</HI> and is now accounted as part of <HI>Ermeland.</HI> VIII. VARMONI, for his portion was assigned VARMIA, lying between the countries <HI>Galindia, Natangia,</HI> and <HI>Pogesamia.</HI> But he not liuing long after his father, this prouince soone againe lost that name, and of his mother was named by a Germane name <HI>Ermeland.</HI> IX. HOGGO, his Lordship was seuered from <HI>Ermeland,</HI> by the riuer <HI>Passerg:</HI> from <HI>Pomesa∣mia,</HI> by the riuer <HI>Weseck</HI> and the lake <HI>Drausen:</HI> but now of the Germanes it is called <HI>Hockerland,</HI> but by the Latines, of POGIA, his daugh∣ter, it is named <HI>Pogesania.</HI> X. POMESO, possessed <HI>Pomesania,</HI> (denominated of him) bounded by the riuers <HI>Weissel, Weeseck, Ossa</HI> or <HI>Moc∣kra.</HI> XI. CHELMO, obtained for his portion <HI>Culmigeria,</HI> or <HI>Hulmigeria</HI> (they call it <HI>Colmishland:</HI>) a prouince lying between the riuers <HI>Weissel, Mockra,</HI> or <HI>Osso</HI> and <HI>Dreuentza,</HI> well replenished with castels and cities. Heere is another shire worth the remembrance which they call <HI>Sossaw: Item</HI> another called LOBOVIA, <HI>(Lobaw)</HI> belonging to the Bishop of <HI>Culm.</HI> HVNTAVV, also a very little prouince, but well inhabited. There is also an iland about <HI>Margeburg</HI> (or <HI>Marienburg</HI>) enclosed round with a bancke or wall by the <HI>Crucigeri,</HI> the knight of the <HI>Holy Crosse,</HI> against the inundations and breaking-in of the riuers <HI>Weissel</HI> and <HI>Nogot,</HI> and it is called <HI>The Greater ile, <HI>Gros Werder.</HI> The Lesser ile, <HI>Das klein Werder,</HI></HI> is in <HI>Pomerell,</HI> about <HI>Dantzk.</HI> Lastly, MARIANA by <HI>Marienwerder,</HI> an Iland so called, which is not in∣habited, but reserued for pasture and meddow yeelding yearely great profit.</P>
<P>This authour promiseth a peculiar Treatise of <HI>Prussia,</HI> with a further discourse of this his mappe. But of this thou maiest read more in <HI>Guaginus Veronensis</HI> in his history of <HI>Sarmatia. Dauid Chytraeus</HI> also in his Saxon Chronicle hath excellently well described the same.</P>
<P><HI>Amber,</HI> (the Latines call it <HI>Succinum</HI> and <HI>Electrum,</HI> the Germanes <HI>Bernstein, Agstein, Ammeren</HI>) is found plentifully on the coast of this country, and no where els in the world beside, to the great gaine and inriching of this Nation. Diuers haue written of the nature and properties of this Simple. But none better, in my iudgement, than <HI>Andreas Aurifaber Vratislauiensis,</HI> in a seuerall tract, written both in La∣tine and Dutch.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Iuonia,</HI> (as <HI>Lewenclay</HI> writeth) extendeth it selfe along the sea coast aboue 4000. furlongs, and where it is nar∣rowest it is 1300. furlongs broad. The Prussians, Lithuanians, and Russians dwell round about it, the rest the Liuonian Gulfe doth bound. <HI>Liuonia</HI> conteineth the CVRONES, ESTHENI, and LETTI, nations different both in maners and language. In the cities and townes they vse the Saxon or German tongue. The country is full of wood, plaine and champion without hils or mountaines, for the most part lying lay and vnhusbanded, notwithstanding that the soile is good and fertile. For if you shall except wine and oile, and some few other such things which nature yeeldeth to some countries that are situate in a more temperate cli∣mate, (for these only are brought in hither vnto them) other things more necessary for the maintenance of mans life, are heere found in such great plenty, that they do liberally communicate them to strangers and for∣reiners. They haue great plenty of Fish and Deere. <HI>Munster</HI> affirmeth, that the Hares in this country do in euery season of the yeare change their colour: for in the winter they are white, and in the summer they are gray. From hence, wax, hony, ashes, stone-pitch, <HI>(pix arida)</HI> liquid pitch, (the Dutch call it <HI>Ther,</HI> we, <HI>Tarre</HI>) and that kind of corne which the Latines call <HI>Secale,</HI> the Germanes <HI>Rogghe,</HI> and we <HI>Rie,</HI> is yearely brought vnto vs in great abundance.</P>
<P>It hath certaine cities very large and finely built; of them the chiefest is RIGA, a colonie of the Germanes of the Bishopricke of <HI>Breme,</HI> commodiously seated vpon the riuer <HI>Duin.</HI> It is a goodly Mart towne, and the Metropolitane of the whole prouince. RIVALIA, (they vulgarly call it <HI>Reuel,</HI> the Russians <HI>Roliua,</HI>) built by <HI>Waldemare</HI> king of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> famous for his goodly hauen vpon a bay of the Balticke or East-sea. This for traffique is not lesse frequented or populous then <HI>Riga.</HI> DORPATVM, <HI>(Derpt)</HI> neere neighbour to the Russians, which call it <HI>Iuriongorod.</HI> The riuer <HI>Becke</HI> runneth by the walles of this city, very commodious for traffique with the Russians. This riuer is caried in one channell into the sea, which running violently with a great fall from steep rocks, worketh the same effect to the people neere adioining, as <HI>Lewenclay</HI> saith, that the cataracts or fals of the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> did to the Aegyptians, which in continuance of time by little and little grow to be deaffish and thicke of hearing. Besides these cities there are certaine lesser townes, fortified with goodly strong castles; VENDA, <HI>Wenden,</HI> the more honourable for that heere the Grand-captaine or Master of the order, keepeth his court. It is situate in the middest of the country: Then VELINVM, <HI>Welum, Parnaw,</HI> vpon the sea, <HI>Wolmer, Veseburgum,</HI> (I thinke they call it <HI>Yseborg) Wittestein, Narua,</HI> and others. <HI>Willichius</HI> and <HI>Cureus</HI> do thinke that the <HI>Efflui</HI> and <HI>Limouij</HI> did sometime dwell in these quarters.

<HEAD>POMERANIA, or POMERLAND.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Etrus Artopoeus Pomeranus</HI> in <HI>Munsters</HI> Cosmography thus describeth this country, his natiue soile: POMOERA∣NIA, saith he, situate vpon the Balticke sea, of the first inhabitants, in their natiue language, that is, in the Wandall tongue, is called PAMORZI. It is still possessed of the first in-borne inhabitants, gouerned by their proper Prin∣ces, and was neuer subdued or made subiect to any forrein iurisdiction. It is in all places very fertile, well watered with riuers, brookes, lakes, creekes, and in-lets from the sea; it hath many good hauens, rich pastures, and good corne grounds: it hath great plenty of apples, cattell, deere, fishes, foule, corne, butter, cheese, hony, wax and such like commodities; it hath many rich mountaines, populous cities, townes, castels, and villages; there is no void place or wast ground in it, but those which lakes or mountaines do possesse. Before Christianity was entertained here, they spake the Wandall language, and followed their fashions and maner of life, vntill such time as they were sub∣dued vnder the command of the Roman Emperours, for then together with Religion they began to vse the Saxon tongue, which to this day they retaine. Thus farre <HI>Artopoeus. Pomerye,</HI> in the Wandalian language, which is the same with the Slauonian tongue, signifieth no∣thing els, as <HI>Herberstein</HI> affirmeth, but neere the sea or a marine coast. The banke or sea-wall of this country is so strongly fortified by na∣ture with such a strong rampart, that heere is no feare of the sea breaking in to ouerflow them. The more famous cities vpon this coast, be∣sides, some other situate further within the land, are, <HI>Stetin, Newgard, Stargard, &amp;c.</HI> STETIN sometime was but a small village inhabited by a few poore fishermen, but after that Christianity was planted heere about, <HI>Wineta</HI> vtterly destroied, and the mart was remoued hither, it begun presently so to flourish, that now it is become the Metropolitan of the whole country. It is most pleasantly seated vpon the banke of the riuer <HI>Oder,</HI> from the which it ariseth by little and little higher vpon the side of an hill. It is enclosed with a strong wall and deep trench. GRYPSVVALD, is a towne in the Dukedome of <HI>Wolgast,</HI> which others do call the Dukedome of <HI>Barth:</HI> this towne being long together much afflicted with ciuill warres, was much hindered and impaired: but in the yeare 1456. by erecting and placing of an Vniuersity there, it began againe by little and little to lift vp the head. IVLINVM, a towne sometime not inferiour vnto the goodly cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> whether you respect the wealth of the citizens or stately buildings of the same. This was sometime a famous mart towne of the Wandalls. Such a multitude of merchants did flocke hither, from <HI>Russia, Saxony, Laussnitz, Meisen,</HI> and all parts of <HI>Wandal-land,</HI> in such troopes, that in all <HI>Europe,</HI> except <HI>Constantinople,</HI> there was scarce such a mart to be found: but it was so shaken by the violent warres of the Danes, that at last it was almost wholly brought to nothing; such is the mutability of vnconstant fortune alwaies delighted in change. Now they call it <HI>Wollin.</HI> STRALSVND, vpon the sea shore. It hath had sometime his proper prince, viz. the Duke of <HI>Barth.</HI> It is a city very populous and greatly frequented by Merchants. WINETA, this sometime was also a city of good reckoning, peraduenture it is now called <HI>Archon</HI> or <HI>Iulinum, (Wollin.)</HI> For the cities of <HI>Wandal-land,</HI> according to the diuersity of languages of sundry nations, had their diuers names. That which the Wandalls called <HI>Stargard,</HI> the Saxons named <HI>Aldenburg,</HI> and the Danes <HI>Bannesia</HI> as <HI>Crantzius</HI> affirmeth. But I thinke it good to set down the description of this country, which the singular learned man, M. <HI>Peter Edling</HI> sent me from <HI>Colberg,</HI> in this maner: <HI>Pomerland</HI> at this day hath forty cities, enclosed with walls and ditches; besides certaine goodly castles and monasteries.

<HEAD>ROMANIA, anciently called THRACIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat country which now they call ROMANIA, the ancients called THRACIA.

Lastly, it was since called by one name <HI>Romania,</HI> which it still retaineth. Yet about <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> I vnderstand the Turkes do call it, <HI>Galatia,</HI> where also at this day there is the city <HI>Galata,</HI> which we call <HI>Pera,</HI> and the old Historiographers named <HI>Cornu Bizantium,</HI> the horne of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> The famous MOVN∣TAINES of this country are <HI>Hoemus, (Monte Argentaro,</HI> or <HI>Catena mundi,</HI> the chaine of the world, the Italians call it: the Turkes, <HI>Balkan:</HI> the Slauonians, <HI>Cumouiza:) Rhodope, (Valizu,</HI> or <HI>Czernaniwerti,</HI> they now call it) <HI>Or∣belus, (Karopnitze) Pangaeus, (Malaca</HI> or <HI>Castagna</HI>) and diuers others of lesser note.

<HEAD>SCANDIA, OR THE NORTHREN <HI>Kingdomes.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Mappe conteineth almost all the Northen tract of the knowen world: but especially the Neck-land or <HI>Peninsula,</HI> knowen vnto the old writers by these names, <HI>Scandia, Scandinauia, Bal∣tia</HI> and <HI>Basilia,</HI> but to them neuer throughly discried: which in regard of his greatnesse they haue called <HI>Another World,</HI> and the Shoppe of men, and as it were the scabberd from whence so ma∣ny Nations haue been drawen. But of the diuers names of this country, read that which we haue written at the mappe of <HI>Island,</HI> as also in our Treasury of Geography, in the word BASILIA. This Neckeland in this our age conteineth three kingdomes, <HI>Norwey, Swedland</HI> and <HI>Gotland;</HI> with a part of the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and many other prouinces, as <HI>Bothny, Finmarke, Finland Lappland, &amp;c.</HI> whose seuerall descriptions we will heere set downe out of <HI>Iames Ziegler.</HI></P>
<P>NORVEGIA, <HI>Norway,</HI> if you would interpret it, is as much to say, as the Northren tract, or Northren way. This was sometime a most flourishing kingdome, and comprehended <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and <HI>Friesland</HI> with the circumiacent Ilands, vntill such time as the kingdome was gouerned by an hereditary succession of kings. Afterward the line failing, in the time of vacancie, by the consent of the Nobility it was decreed, that the kings should be chosen by electi∣on. At this day it is vnder the iurisdiction of the kings of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> who do not only take the lawfull reuenews iustly due to the crowne, but imposing intolerable exactions, and by scraping and raking all commodities into their hands, they con∣uey all the wealth of this country into <HI>Denmarke.</HI> Neither is this aggreeuance alone, but with all the disaduantage and con∣dition of the place doth much hurt the subiects: for all the hauens, roads, &amp; shipping are at the command of the king of <HI>Den∣marke:</HI> so that neither they may without his leaue vse the sea or transport their merchandise into forren countries. This kingdome either for the temperature of the aire, goodnesse of the soile, or benefit of the sea is not of meane estimation and account. This doth transport into other parts of <HI>Europe</HI> a fish which is a kind of codde, slitte and spread vpon a post and so dried and hardened with the frost and cold: and thereupon the Germanes call it <HI>Stockfish.</HI> The best time of the yeare to catch them is in <HI>Ianuary,</HI> when as the weather is coldest to drie them: those which are taken when the weather is more mild, they shrinke or rotte away, and are not fit to be transported any whither. All the sea coast of <HI>Norway</HI> is very calme and temperate: the sea freeseth not: the snow continueth not long.</P>
<P>SVECIA, <HI>Sweden</HI> or <HI>Swedland,</HI> is a kingdome rich of siluer, copper, lead, iron, corne and cattell. Wonderfull plenty of fish is heere taken both in riuers, lakes, and creekes, aswell as in the maine ocean. Heere are many Deere and wild beasts. <HI>Stockholme</HI> is the kings seat and chiefe mart towne, a city fortified both by nature, by art, and industrie of the ingenious Ar∣chitect. It standeth in a fenne, like <HI>Venice:</HI> and thereof it took the name, for that being situate in the waters it is built vpon piles, which they call <HI>Stockes.</HI></P>
<P>GOTHIA, <HI>(Gotland)</HI> that is, the Good land, is subiect to the king of <HI>Sweden.</HI> In it is the port and mart towne <HI>Calmar,</HI> a great city. Heere is a goodly Castle which for ingenious Architecture or Fortification, as also for large compasse and con∣tent is not much inferiour to that of <HI>Millane</HI> in <HI>Italie.</HI> Neere <HI>Tinguallen</HI> are mines of excellent iron. Thus farre <HI>Ziegler.</HI></P>
<P>Of DENMARKE and the BRITISH ILES we will speake nothing in this place, seeing that we entreated of them at their proper and seuerall mappes. In this chart there is described also ISLAND, an Iland as famous as any other for strange mira∣cles and secret works of nature. <HI>Item</HI> GROENLAND, another Iland knowen to very few. Heere also is FRIESLAND, a third iland altogether vnknowen to ancient writers; neither is it once named of the latter Geographers or Hydrographers; only <HI>Nicolao Zeno,</HI> a Venetian, who, in the yeare of Christ 1380. tossed with many continuall bitter stormes in this sea, at last rent and weather-beaten, arriued in this Ile. This authour affirmeth that this iland is subiect to the king of <HI>Norway,</HI> and to be greater then <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that the chiefe towne is of the same name with the Ile it selfe; lastly, that the country people do for the most part liue by fishing. For in the hauen of this towne they catch such abundance of all sorts of fish, that from thence they lade whole shippes, and transport them into other ilands neere adioining. The sea next to this iland vpon the West, full of shelues and rocks, as he writeth, is of the inhabitants called <HI>Mare Icarium, Icarus</HI> sea: and an iland in it, he saith is named ICARIA. Of GROENLAND he writeth, that the winter heere is 9. moneths long, and all that time it neuer rain∣eth, nor the snow which falleth in the beginning of winter euer dissolueth vntill the latter end of the same. But that is most wonderfull which he telleth of the Monastery of the order of Frier Predicants, dedicated to the honour of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in this Iland: namely, that there is not farre from it a mountaine, which like vnto <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicilia</HI> doth at certaine seasons burne and cast out huge flakes of fire, and that there is in the same place a fountaine of hot or skalding waters, wherewith not only all the chambers of this monastery are warmed in the maner of Stones, and hot-houses, but also all kind of meat and bread is sodden and dressed, and with no other fire. All the monastery is built of a kind of hollow light stone, which the flames of that burning mountaine do cast forth. For these burning stones, being by nature somewhat fat and oily, are solid and firme, but being quenched with this water, they become drie, full of holes and light; and the water wherewith they were quen∣ched is turned into a clammy kind of stuffe like <HI>bitumen,</HI> wherewith these stones are laied, in steed of mortar, when they are to vse them in building: and thus they make a sure worke against the iniury of all weathers, Their orchyeards also and gar∣dens watered with this water are alwaies green and do flourish almost all the yeare long, with all maner of flowres, kinds of corne and fruits. This Priory standeth vpon the sea shore, and hath a reasonable capacious and large hauen; into which the forenamed fountaine emptying his waters, doth make it so warme that it neuer freeseth, in the hardest and egerest froast that euer was knowen. Whereupon heere is such abundance of fish, which do flocke hither from more colde places, that not only these Monkes, but also the neighbours round about are furnished from hence with prouision of victuall. These thinges amongst many others <HI>Zenus</HI> hath written of these Ilands, who, being made by <HI>Zichimnus,</HI> king of certaine Ilands heere about, high Admirall of his nauy, discouered all these Northren coasts.</P>
<P>The ile FRIESLAND, now againe in these our daies was descried by the Englishmen, and was by them called by a new name WEST ENGLAND. In old writers there are but few records left of these Ilands. Amongst the new writers <HI>Olaus Magnus Gothus, Episcopus Vpsaliensis, Albertus Crantzius, Saxo Grammaticus, Iacobus Zieglerus, Sigismundus ab Herberstein</HI> in his commentaries of <HI>Moscouia,</HI> haue described these countries: And <HI>Nicolas Wimman</HI> hath set forth the nauigation of the Northren sea. See also a little discourse of <HI>Antony</HI> and <HI>Nicolas Zenis,</HI> two brethren, of the ilands situate vnder the North pole, together with the shipwracke of <HI>Peter Quirinus,</HI> written by himselfe and <HI>Christophero Fiorauante,</HI> as also by <HI>Nicholas Mighel,</HI> in the Italian tongue. There is also a discourse of these Northren parts written by <HI>Sebastian Cabato,</HI> who in the yeare 1557. first sailed into these quarters. But aboue all the history of <HI>Saxony</HI> lately written and set out by <HI>Dauid Chytraeus</HI> is not to be forgotten.</P>

<HEAD>ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Do find in the Ecclesiasticall history lately set forth and imprinted vnder the name of M. <HI>Adams:</HI> That the people of this Iland came vnto <HI>Adelbert</HI> Bishop of <HI>Breme,</HI> earnestly entreating him to appoint them some learned diuines that might be able to preach the Gospell and plant Christianity amongst them. Neither do I thinke that there is a∣ny mention of this Nation in any other more ancient writer than he. Although I must confesse, that <HI>Sigebertus Gemblacensis</HI> hath left record, that Great King <HI>Arthur,</HI> about the yeare of Christ 470. subdued this iland and redu∣ced the people to his obedience. This I take as a fable, not for any true history. For I do certainly know that this was neuer written by <HI>Sigebert,</HI> but shuffled in, as many things els, by some other. For a very faire Manuscript copy of mine owne, as also another in parchment of my friend, haue it not.) Now this <HI>Adelbert</HI> died about the yeare af∣ter Christs incarnation 1070. And that the name <HI>Thule,</HI> oft spoken of almost by all old writers aswell Poets and Historians as Geographers, doth not pertaine to this Iland (against the opinion well neere of all the learned men of our time) but rather to <HI>Scone (Scandia Peninsula)</HI> a neck-land of <HI>Norway,</HI> not only the authority of <HI>Procopius;</HI> a graue discreet writer; but also for that a note and remnant of that name yet remaineth to this day in <HI>Scone,</HI> in that part which is opposite to the Or∣keney iles; namely in a place of <HI>Norway</HI> where the famous Mart of the <HI>Belgae</HI> is seated. For amongst other shires of <HI>Norway</HI> there is one in this place which they call <HI>Tilemercke,</HI> that is, the March or shire of <HI>Tule.</HI> The ilands also ouer against this shore which vulgarly are called <HI>Hetland</HI> and <HI>Shetland,</HI> the seamen, as I vnderstand out of <HI>England</HI> by the relation of my good friend M. W. <HI>Camden,</HI> are commonly called <HI>Thylinsel,</HI> where∣by I conceiue that this Iland tooke the name from the next maine land opposite vnto it. For what els is <HI>Thilensel,</HI> but the iland of <HI>Thile?</HI> This opinion of mine not only <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> doth confirme, who writeth that <HI>Thule</HI> was opposite to the sea coast of the <HI>Belgae;</HI> (he directly saith, I say <HI>Belgarum,</HI> not <HI>Britannorum littori,</HI> the sea coast of <HI>Britaine</HI> where indeed <HI>Island</HI> is situate, not <HI>Thule:</HI>) but also <HI>Ptolemey</HI> the prince of all Geo∣graphers and writers in that argument, who placeth <HI>Thule</HI> vnder the 29. degree of Longitude, and 63. of Latitude. Which position and calcula∣tion of degrees doth exactly and precisely fall vpon <HI>Tilemarke.</HI> And as for <HI>Island</HI> there is no man that hath looked with halfe an eie into Geogra∣phicall Mappes and Charts, but doth know it to lie vnder the first degree of Longitude, and the sixtieth degree of Latitude. And I perswade my selfe euen <HI>Arngrimus Ionas</HI> himselfe, an Islander borne, in that his Treatise of <HI>Island,</HI> where he saith that the latitude of this Iland is about 44. de∣grees and 45. minutes was much deceiued. It is therefore as cleare as the noone day, as he saith, that <HI>Island</HI> is not the same that <HI>Thule</HI> was: and the same <HI>Procopius</HI> saith, that it is inhabited by thirteen Nations, and gouerned by so many Kings, and to be tenne times as great as <HI>Brittaine:</HI> so that not without good cause <HI>Stephanus</HI> giueth it the title of Great; when as it is certaine that <HI>Island</HI> is much lesse than <HI>Brittaine.</HI> The same <HI>Procopius</HI> affirmeth that the <HI>Scritifinni,</HI> a kind of people so called, did inhabite <HI>Thule;</HI> these <HI>Diaconus</HI> nameth <HI>Strictofinni:</HI> and speaketh of them in <HI>Scandia;</HI> as doth also <HI>Iornandes</HI> in his history; notwithstanding he corruptly calleth them (that I may note this by the way) <HI>Crefennae.</HI> Thus, gentle Reader, thou seest that which they name <HI>Scandia</HI> or <HI>Scone,</HI> he calleth <HI>Thule:</HI> and the same nation to this day dwelleth in the same <HI>Scandia,</HI> called by the same name no whit corrupted. For they are called vulgarly <HI>Scrickefinner,</HI> and do dwell in <HI>Scandia,</HI> and not in <HI>Island.</HI> In <HI>Thule Procopius</HI> writeth, that there be huge great woods: in <HI>Island</HI> all the world knoweth there are none at all. And so <HI>Isacius</HI> vpon <HI>Lycophron</HI> saith truly, when he affirmeth that <HI>Thule,</HI> is vpon the East of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> not vpon the North, as is <HI>Island.</HI> Contrary to that which <HI>Strabo</HI> (a most worthy and diligent Geographer, by the sound iudgement of all the learned) saith of it, but from the relation, as there he addeth of <HI>Pytheas,</HI> a shamefull lying historiographer, whose custome was, as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in his second booke writeth, to counterfait and coine fables so cunningly that ordinarily they passed for true stories. This is that <HI>Thule,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> reporteth, when the Romane nauy sailed round about <HI>Brittaine</HI> was seen and viewed by them, but not regarded, and therefore not entered as is probable. This could not be <HI>Island,</HI> which is much farther off, and out of kenning. But this is enough in this place of <HI>Thule</HI> or <HI>Scandia.</HI> We will addresse our selues to speake of <HI>Island,</HI> an iland altogether vnknowen, and not once named in any ancient writer.</P>
<P>ISLAND, or, the <HI>Frosen</HI> or <HI>Icie land,</HI> which is all one, was so named of the ice which lieth continually vpon his North side: for there now be∣ginneth the Frosen-sea, as <HI>Crantzius</HI> writeth. It was called SNELAND, of the Snow which all the yeare long doth heere in some places continue: <HI>Item</HI> GARDARSHOLM, that is, <HI>Garders ile,</HI> so called, as <HI>Arngrimus</HI> himselfe being an Islander borne writeth, of one <HI>Gardar</HI> a man so named who first found it or inhabited the same. This iland is an hundred Germane miles in length, as commonly most writers do hold; but the foresaid <HI>Arn∣grimus Ionas</HI> saith it is 144. miles long. For the most part it is not inhabited, but is wast and mountainous, especially toward the North part: by reason of the bitter blasts of the South winds, which will not suffer, as <HI>Olaus</HI> teacheth, so much as any low shrubbe or bush once to put forth his head. It is subiect to the king of <HI>Norway,</HI> and so hath continued euer since the yeare of Christ 1260. at what time first, the same <HI>Arngrime</HI> affir∣meth, they did their homage to that Crowne. Whereupon the king of <HI>Denmarke</HI> euery yeare sendeth thither a Lieutenant, by whom they are now gouerned, as in times past they were by certaine Bishops of their owne; by whom they were, as we said before, conuerted vnto Christianity, in the time of <HI>Adelbert</HI> Bishop of <HI>Breme.</HI> In the raigne of <HI>Harald</HI> with the faire lockes, (<HI>Pulchricomus, Harfagro</HI> they vulgarly called him as <HI>Ionas</HI> writeth) who was the first Monarch of <HI>Norway,</HI> it was first begun to be inhabited, as some would faine perswade: namely, when he had ouercome the pety kings and had banished them out of <HI>Norway,</HI> they being driuen to seeke their dwelling in some other place, they forsooke their owne natiue country, shipped themselues together with their wiues, children, and whole families, landed at the length in this iland, and heere seated themselues. This seemeth to me to haue happened about the yeare of Christs incarnation 1000. but the forenamed authour <HI>Arngrimus Ionas</HI> saith that it was in the yeare 874. who also there setteth downe a Catalogue and names of all their Bishops. The first Bishop, as <HI>Crantzius</HI> writeth, was <HI>Isleff.</HI> That it was subiect to the command of the same Norweies about 200. yeares, I find in the abridgement of <HI>Zenies</HI> Eclogs, where I find that <HI>Zichmi</HI> king of <HI>Friesland</HI> attempted warre against this iland, but in vaine, and was repelled by a garrison of souldiers placed there by the king of <HI>Norway,</HI> to defend the same from the assault of enemies. It is diuided into foure parts or prouinces according to the foure quarters of the World: namely, into <HI>Westfiordung, Austlendingafiordung, Nordlingafiordung</HI> and <HI>Sundlendingafiordung,</HI> as to say as the West quarter, East quarter, North quarter and South quarter. It hath but two Bishops seas, <HI>Schalholdt,</HI> and <HI>Hola;</HI> with certaine scholes adioined vnto them. In the diocesse of <HI>Hola</HI> are the Monasteries <HI>Pingora, Remested, Modur,</HI> and <HI>Munketuere.</HI> In the diocesse of <HI>Schalholdt</HI> are <HI>Videy, Pyrnebar, Kirkebar</HI> and <HI>Skirda.</HI> Yet by the letters of <HI>Velleius,</HI> the authour of this chart, which he wrote vnto me, I do vnderstand that there are heere nine monasteries: and besides them 329. churches. They haue no coine of their owne, nor cities: for the mountaines are to them in steed of cities, and fountaines for pleasure and delights, as <HI>Crantzius</HI> testifieth, who affirmeth that for the most part they dwell in caues, making their lodgings and roomes by cut∣ting and digging them out in the sides of hilles. The which also <HI>Olaus</HI> doth testifie, especially in the winter time. They build their houses of fish bones, for want of wood. Contrariwise <HI>Ionas</HI> he saith, that heere are many churches and houses built reasonably faire and sumptuously of wood, stone and turffe. Wares they exchange with Merchants for other wares. Forrein dainties and pleasures they are not acquainted withall. They speake the Cimbrian language, or the ancient Germane tongue, into which we saw this other day the holy Scriptures translated, and imprinted at <HI>Hola</HI> (a place in the North part of this iland) in a most goodly and faire letter, in the yeare of our Lord 1584. I say, in the old Germane tongue: for I do obserue it to be the same with that, in which a little booke that is imprinted vnder the name of <HI>Otfrides Gospels,</HI> is written in. <HI>Ionas</HI> himselfe confesseth that they haue no maner of cattell beside Horses, and Kine. <HI>Velleius</HI> witnesseth that they haue no trees but Berch and Iuniper. The soile is fatte for pastorage and the grasse so ranke, that all men that haue written of this iland do iontly and with one consent affirme, that except they do sometime fetch their cattell from the pasture and moderate their feeding, they wil be in danger of being stopped vp with their owne fatte. Yet all in vaine oft times, as the same <HI>Arngrime</HI> affirmeth. The soile is not good for corne or for eareable ground, and so it beareth not any ma∣ner of graine, therefore for the most part they liue altogether on fish. Which also being dried and beaten, and as it were ground to meale they make into loaues and cakes, and do vse it at their tables in stead of bread. Their drinke in former time was faire water, but now of corne, brought vnto them from forren places, they haue learned to brew a kind of beere: so that after they began to trade with strangers resorting to them, they began also to loue better liquours and haue left their drinking of water. For as <HI>Georgius Bruno</HI> maketh me beleeue, the Lubekers, Hamburgers and Bremers do yearely resort to this iland, which thither do cary Meale, Bread, Beere, Wine, Aqua vitae, course English clothes and other such of low prices, both Wollen and Linnen, Iron, Steele, Tinne, Copper, Siluer, Mony both Siluer and Gold, Kniues, Shoes, Coifes and Ker∣cheifes for women, and Wood whereof they build their houses and make their boats. For these they exchange the <HI>Island</HI> cloth, (they commonly call it <HI>Watman</HI>) huge lumps of Brimstone, and great store of dried fish, <HI>Stockefish</HI> we call it. All this out of the West and South parts of the same. Out of the East and North part of the iland, where there is great plenty of grasse, they transport into other countries, Mutton and Beefe, butter and

Their oxen and kine are all heere polled and without hornes: their sheepe are not so. <HI>Saxo Grammaticus</HI> and <HI>Olaus Magnus</HI> do tell of many wonders and strange works of God in this iland, whereof some it will not be amisse to receit in this place. But especially the mount <HI>Hekla,</HI> which continually burneth like vnto <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicilia,</HI> although alwaies those flames do not appeare, but at certaine times, as <HI>Arngrimus Ionas</HI> writeth, and affirmeth to be recorded in their histories, as namely in the yeare 1104. 1157. 1222. 1300. 1340. 1362. 1389. and 1558. which was the last time that the fire brake out of this hill. Of the like nature is another hill, which they call <HI>Hel∣gas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll,</HI> that is, the Holy mount. Of the which mountaine the forenamed <HI>Bruno,</HI> a laborious student, and for that his worthy worke which he hath set out of all the cities of the World, famous and knowen farre and neere all the World ouer, hath written in his priuate letters vnto me, that in the yeare 1580. (<HI>Ionas</HI> saith it fell out in the yeare 1581.) not in <HI>Hecla,</HI> but in another mount, namely, in <HI>Helgesel,</HI> fire and stones were cast out with such crackes, thundering and hideous noise, that fourescore miles off one would haue thought great ordenance and double canons had been dis∣charged heere. At this hill there is an huge gulfe, where spirits of men lately departed, do offer themselues so plainely to be seene and discerned of those that sometime knew them in their life time, that they are often taken for liuing men of such as are not aware that they are dead: neither do they perceiue that they were deceiued, vntill the Ghosts be gone. (<HI>Ionas</HI> accounteth this for a fable.) There are also certaine spirits or ghosts, which do shew themselues apparantly to be seen in the businesses of mortall men, or of such as came to their end by some violent mischance, as <HI>Olaus</HI> reporteth. They call these <HI>Drols,</HI> as <HI>Rithmayer</HI> testifieth. (Now <HI>Drol,</HI> is a giant of the mountaines, if we may beleeue <HI>Arngrime Ionas</HI> an Ilander by birth and bringing vp.) Heere is a spring which by reason of a filthy smoaking water which runneth from it, killeth any thing that na∣turally the earth bringeth forth: and whatsoeuer is besmered with this smokie fume, in continuance of time becommeth as hard as a stone, yet still retaining the shape that it had before. There is also a spring of pestilent waters, which whosoeuer shall tast or drinke of, will presently be as if he had drunke poison. Heere also are certaine waters that are in propertie and tast somewhat like drinke that is made of mault. There are fires heere, that will not burne or consume flax, yet they will quite drie vp and consume water. They haue beares, crowes, and white hares. As also Eagles with white tailes, as our authour <HI>Ionas</HI> the Islander whom we haue often cited, doth witnesse. These <HI>Pliny</HI> (as he there alleageth) calleth <HI>Pygargos,</HI> I thinke we call them <HI>Wringtailes.</HI> But those that are desirous to know all the strange wonders of this iland let them read <HI>Albert Crantz, Saxo Grammaticus, Iohannes Magnus,</HI> and <HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> whom they may beleeue or not beleeue, according as they shall find cause. To those they may adioine that which <HI>Dauid Chytraeus</HI> in his Saxon history hath written of this iland. Except I be deceiued, the fable which <HI>Isacius</HI> vpon <HI>Lyco∣phron</HI> reciteth, of a certaine iland of <HI>Brittany,</HI> whither he saith the soules of dead men are transported, doth perteine to this iland.

<HEAD>A declaration of the Markes and Letters of this Mappe.</HEAD>
<P>A. Is a fish which they commonly call <HI>Nahual.</HI> If any man eat of this fish, he dieth presently. It hath a tooth in the forepart of his head, standing out seuen cubites. This diuers haue sold for the Vnicornes horne. It is thought to be a good antidote and soueraigne medicine against poison. This Monster is forty elles in length. B. The <HI>Roider,</HI> a fish of an hundred and thirty elles in length, which hath no teeth. The flesh of it is very good meat, wholesome and toothsome. The fatte of it is good against many diseases. C. The <HI>Burchualur,</HI> hath his head bigger than all the body beside. It hath many very strong teeth, whereof they make Chesmen or Tablemen. It is threescore cubites long. D. The <HI>Hyena,</HI> the sea hogge, a monstrous kind of fish, of which thou maiest read in the 21. booke of <HI>Olaus Magnus.</HI> E. <HI>Ziphius,</HI> (it may be he meaneth <HI>Xi∣phius,</HI> the sword fish) an horrible sea monster, swallowing the blacke seale at one bitte. F. The English whale, thirty elles long: it hath no teeth, but the tongue of it is seuen elles in length. G. <HI>Hroshualur,</HI> that is as much to say as the Sea-horse, with a mane hanging downe from his necke like an horse. It often doth the fishermen great hurt and skare. H. The greatest kind of Whales, which seldome sheweth it selfe; it is more like a little iland, than a fish. It cannot follow or chase the smaller fishes, by reason of the huge greatnesse and waight of his body, yet he praieth vpon many, which he catcheth by a naturall wile and subtilty which he vseth for to get his food. I. <HI>Skautuhvalur,</HI> this fish altogether full of gristles or bones; is somewhat like a ray or skaite but an infinite deale bigger: when it appeareth, it is like an iland, and with his sinnes ouerturneth ships and boates. K. <HI>Seenaut,</HI> sea cowes, of colour gray: they sometimes come out of the sea and do feed vpon the land many in a company toge∣ther. They haue a little bagge hanging at their nose, by the helpe of which they liue in the water: that being broken, they liue altogether vpon the land, and do accompany themselues with other kine. L. <HI>Steipereidur,</HI> a most gentle and tame kind of whale; which for the defence of the fishermen fighteth against other Whales. It is forbidden by Proclamation that no man may kill or hurt this sort of Whale. It is in length an hundred cubites at the least. M. <HI>Staukul,</HI> the Dutchmen call it <HI>Springual;</HI> he hath beene seene to stand a whole day together vpright vpon his taile. It is so called of leaping or skipping. It is a very dangerous enemy to seamen and fishers; and greedily seeketh after mans flesh. N. <HI>Rostunger,</HI> (which also is otherwise called a <HI>Rosmar,</HI>) is somewhat like a sea-calfe: it goeth in the bottome of the sea vpon foure feet, but very short ones. His skinne may scarcely be pearced with any weapon. Hee sleepeth twelue houres together hanging by his two long teeth vpon some rocke or cliffe. Ech of his teeth are at the least an elle long, but the length of his whole body is foureteen elles long. O. <HI>Sperma ceti,</HI> par∣macitty, or a base kind of amber, they commonly call it <HI>Hualambur.</HI> P. Blockes and Trunkes of tree by force of winde and violent tempest blowne vp by the rootes from off the cliffes of <HI>Norway,</HI> tossed to and fro and passing through many stormes at length are cast vp, or do rest against this shore. Q. Huge and maruailous great heaps of ice brought hither with the tide from the frozen sea, making a great and terrible noise; some pieces of which oft times are fourty cubites bigge; vpon these in some places white beares do sitte closely, watching the silly fish which heere about do play and sport themselues.</P>

<HEAD>RVSSIA, Or rather THE EMPIRE OF THE GRAND DVKE OF MOSCOVIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Mappe comprehendeth not all <HI>Russia;</HI> for heere are wanting <HI>Polonia</HI> and <HI>Lithuania,</HI> which generally are conteined vnder the name of <HI>Russia:</HI> But the whole Empire of the Grand Duke of <HI>Moscouia;</HI> which is bounded on the North by the frozen Sea; on the East, vpon the Tartars; on the South, vpon the Turkes and Polanders; on the West; it abutteth vpon <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Sweden:</HI> all whose countries and prouinces <HI>Sigismundus Baro</HI> of <HI>Herber∣stein</HI> hath seuerally and particularly described; vnto whom we send the thirstie Reader for further satisfaction. Of the Religion, habite, manners and kind of life of this Nation; we haue out of him very willingly for thine ease selected these few things. In their Religion they do for the most part follow the rites and ceremonies of the Greeke Church. Their Priests are maried. They haue Images in their Churches. When their children are baptized, three times dipped all ouer into the water; and the water in the font is seuerally con∣secrated for euery child. Although by their constitutions and canons they haue a kind of Auricu∣lar Confession, yet the common people thinketh it to belong only to Princes and Noblemen, and little to pertaine to them. Confession being ended, and penance enioined according to the qua∣lity of the offence and fault, they signe them in the forehead with the signe of the crosse, and with a loud mournefull voice they crie, Iesus Christ, thou sonne of God, haue mercy vpon vs. This is their common forme and maner of praier: for few can say the <HI>Pater noster.</HI> They do communi∣cate in the sacrament of the supper both kinds, mingling the bread with the wine, or the body with the blood. They administer the Lords supper to children of seuen yeares old: for then they say a man doth sinne. The better sort of men, after the communion ended, do spend the day in drunkennesse and riot; and do rather reuerence the same with braue apparell than inward deuo∣tion: the baser sort of people and seruants; for the most part, do labour and worke as at other times; saying, that to make holy day to be idle and to leaue their worke, is for gentlemen and masters; not for poore folkes and seruants. <HI>Purgatory</HI> they do not beleeue, yet they make pray∣ers and do other seruice and ceremonies for the dead. No man doth besprinkle himselfe or suffer any other to cast holy water vpon him; except the Priest himselfe will do it. In the Lent they fast seuen whole weekes together. They marry; and do tolerate bigamy or permit a man to haue two wiues, but they make a question whether it be a lawfull matrimony or not. They grant di∣uorces and separations. They take it not to be adultery, except one man take another mans wife. The state of women in this country is most miserable: for they thinke, except shee like a snaile do carry her house ouer her head, and be continually mewed vp in her closet, or so watched, that by no meanes she may start out of doores, none possibly can be honest. It is a wilie and deceit∣full people, and is rather delighted to liue in seruitude and slauery, than at large and in liberty. All of them do acknowledge themselues to be the Princes seruants. They are seldome quiet: for either they must make warres vpon the Lithuans, the Liuonians, or Tartars: or if they be not em∣ployed in any seruice in forren warres, they are placed in garrisons about the riuers <HI>Don (Tanais,</HI> the ancients called it) and <HI>Occan,</HI> to represse the robberies and inuasions of the Tartars. They weare long cleit gownes, without any pleits, with straite sleeues after the Hungarian fashion: bootes also, for the most part red and short, such as scarse come to their knees, and shoes or clogges clouted and hobbed with iron nailes. They tie their girdles not about their wasts, but beneath their bellies as low as their hippes. They do seuere iustice vpon freebooters and such as robbe by the high way side. Pilfering and manslaughter is seldome punished by death. Their siluer coines or money, are not round, but somewhat long, of an ouall forme or fashioned like an egge-like figure. The country aboundeth with those rich and pretious skinnes or pelts, which from hence are transported and caried all <HI>Europe</HI> ouer; it is almost euery where full of huge woods. All these particulars we haue drawen out of the aboue named <HI>Sigismund.</HI> Many things more of this country thou maist read of in <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Micou, Alexander Gaguine,</HI> his tract of the <HI>Sarmatiaes, Albert Crantz</HI> his <HI>VVandalia, Paulus Iouius</HI> of the Embassage of the Moschouites to <HI>Clement</HI> the eight. <HI>Albertus Campensis</HI> vpon the same, and in the Persian iourneies of <HI>Ambrosio Contareno.</HI> But I would wish thee also for farther satisfaction heerein to read ouer the first and second bookes of <HI>Bonfinius</HI> his first <HI>Decade</HI> of the history of <HI>Hungary:</HI> as also the first booke of the life of <HI>Basilides</HI> written by <HI>O∣derborne,</HI> together with the Chronicle of <HI>Saxony</HI> done by <HI>Dauid Chytraeus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TARTARIA, OR THE EMPIRE OF THE MIGHTIE CHAM.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>E that will take vpon him to describe TARTARIA; he must needes speake of a great number of nations, farre asunder and remote one from another. For all that huge tract and portion of the Maine land is now called <HI>Tartaria,</HI> that is between the East sea, (or as he calleth it <HI>Mare Mangicum,</HI> the sea of <HI>Mangi</HI> or of <HI>Sin,</HI> a country all the World ouer, and vulgarly knowen by the name of <HI>China</HI>) and the South countries, <HI>Sin</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> that part of <HI>India</HI> which is beyond <HI>Ganges,</HI> the country of the <HI>Saci,</HI> the riuer <HI>Iaxartes,</HI> (now they call it <HI>Chesel</HI>) the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, <HI>Mar delle Zabacche (Maeotis palus,</HI> it was called of the ancient writers) and Westward vp as high almost as the Moscouites. For all these countries well neere the Tartars did possesse, and in these places they were seated. So that it comprehendeth that country which the old Historiographers called <HI>Sarmatia</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> both the <HI>Scythiaes</HI> and <HI>Seria,</HI> the country where the <HI>Seres</HI> dwelt, which now I take to be named <HI>Cataio.</HI></P>
<P>The name of this Nation was neuer heard of in <HI>Europe</HI> before the yeare after Christs incarnation 1212. They are diuided (in stead of shires) into <HI>Hordaes,</HI> that is, as the word amongst them doth signifie, into companies or couents. But as they do inhabite large and wide countries farre distant and remote one from another, so in manners and kind of life they are as farre different. They are well limmed men, broad and fatte faced, scowling countenanced and hollow eied, shauen all but their beards, which they neuer cut low: they are strong and of able bodies, and do eat horse flesh and other beasts howsoeuer they come to their deaths: only hogges excepted, from which they wholly abstaine; they can more easily endure hunger and thirst than other men, a little sleepe doth serue them: moreouer when they ride, if they be very hungry and thirsty, they vse to pricke the veines of their horses vpon which they ride, and by drinking of their bloud to slacke their hunger and thirst. And because they roue vp and downe and haue no certaine place of abode, they guide their course and iourney by the stars, especially by the obseruation of the North pole starre, which they in their language call, as <HI>Sigismund Herberstein</HI> testifieth, <HI>Seles nicol,</HI> that is, the iron clubbe naile, or sterne. They stay not long in one place, taking it to be a signe of ill fortune to dwell long vpon one plotte. They obserue no maner of iustice or law. The people, especially the poorer sort, are very rauenous and couetous; alwaies gaping after other mens goods. They haue no maner of vse either of gold or siluer.</P>
<P>In this country thou seest TANGVT, a prouince from whence all the <HI>Rheubarbe,</HI> that is spent and vsed in all the world, is brought vnto vs and other places. Heere also is the country CATAIA, whose chiefe city is <HI>Cambalu,</HI> which, as <HI>Nicolaus de Comitibus</HI> writeth, is eighteen Italian miles about, or as M. <HI>Paulus Venetus,</HI> thirty two. It is of a square forme, in ech of whose corners there are castles built, foure miles in compasse, where continually the Emperours garrisons are kept. But <HI>Quinzai,</HI> a city of the prouince <HI>Mangi,</HI> which is from hence Eastward, vpon the Eastern sea, is thought to be farre big∣ger than this: For this as the same M. <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> affirmeth, who dwelt there about the yeare af∣ter the birth of Christ 1260. is in compasse an hundred miles. The same is also auouched by <HI>Odericus</HI> of <HI>Friuli (de foro Iulio)</HI> who nameth it <HI>Cansay.</HI> It is situate in a lake of fresh water. There are in it 1260. bridges, whereof many are of such great height, that shippes full laden may go vnder them and ne∣uer strike saile Heere the Great <HI>Cham</HI> hath a standing garrison of 12000. trained souldiers continu∣ally resident. It is a wonderfull stately and pleasant city, whereupon it obtained that name, for <HI>Quinzai,</HI> they interpret, The city of <HI>Heauen.</HI></P>
<P>The Tartars call their Emperour <HI>Cham,</HI> which signifieth the same that <HI>Princeps,</HI> a Prince: hereupon <HI>Cambalu</HI> is interpreted, The seate or city of the Prince. <HI>Sigismundus</HI> of <HI>Herberstein</HI> writeth, that the Tartars do call themselues <HI>Besermanni.</HI></P>
<P>The Tartars, together with their manner and course of life, are most liuely described by <HI>Sigis∣mund</HI> of <HI>Herberstein</HI> and <HI>Martine Broniouius:</HI> as also in the Historicall Glasse, or Mirour of histories, writen by <HI>Vincentius Beluacensis,</HI> in the 30. 31. and 32. bookes of the same. See also the commentaries of <HI>Hungary,</HI> written by <HI>Antonio Bonfinio:</HI> M. <HI>Paulus Venetus,</HI> who it is certaine liued long there amongst them; and the Iournall or Trauells of <HI>Iosapha Barbarus</HI> a Venetian. Of their originall, read <HI>Matthias</HI> of <HI>Michou, Haiton</HI> the Armenian, <HI>Caelius secundus Curio</HI> his Saracen history, and the letters of <HI>Iacobo Nauarcho</HI> a Iesuite. Of the Tartars there be many things worth the reading in the trauells of two Fri∣ars, which about the yeare 1247. were sent into these quarters, by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the fourth, in the thirtieth chapter of <HI>Nicephorus</HI> his eigteenth booke. <HI>Laonicus</HI> also hath many things, in diuers places of his workes, of the Tartars vnder the name of the Scythians: the like hath <HI>Gregoras</HI> another Greeke writer. Lastly, <HI>Dauid Chytraeus</HI> in his Saxon chronicle hath written much of this nation. But no man hath more fully and amply set out the maners and life of the Tartars then <HI>William Rubricius,</HI> a Friar of the order of S. <HI>Francis,</HI> a copy of whose trauells into these parts, in the yeare of Christ 1253.

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Ernardinus Scalantus</HI> hath in the Spanish tongue set out a peculiar description of this country in a seue∣rall tract, out of whom we haue gathered these few lines. This huge kingdome of <HI>China,</HI> the inhabi∣tants do call TAME, and themselues TANGIS: but of the bordering nations it is named CHINA, and is that <HI>Tein</HI> or <HI>Sin,</HI> which <HI>Auicenna</HI> so many hundred times mentioneth, and commendeth for rare sim∣ples and plants of soueraigne vse in Physicke: and is the same no doubt with SINAE or <HI>Sinarum regio,</HI> a country for rich commodities much talked of amongst all ancient Cosmographers. This country on the East bordereth vpon the East sea: (vulgarly called <HI>Mare Cin,</HI> the sea of <HI>China</HI>) on the South, vpon the prouince <HI>Cauchinchina:</HI> on the West, it is bounded by <HI>Bramas:</HI> on the North, it hath the <HI>Tartars,</HI> a warlike and stout people, from whom it is defended and seuered partly by an artificiall wall, made by the hand and labour of man, partly by a naturall mountaine which runneth for many hundred miles together between the countries. It is a country very fertile of all maner of things necessary for the maintenance of mans life, cau∣sed not only by the goodnesse of the soile, and temperature of the aire, but especially by the husbandry and industry of the people. For the men heere are not giuen to idlenesse, but are very laborious and painefull. To be idle heere it is counted a shamefull thing. It hath wonderfull store of Gold, Siluer, and Rheubarbe. The sea which beateth vpon this coast, and the riuers which runne through the middest of this country, do abound with all sorts of fish. Vpon the mountaines, vales and meddowes infinite flocks of cattell do feed and are maintained. The woods, forrests and groues are possessed with Bores, Foxes, Hares, Conies, Zebellines, Martens, and diuers other such kind of beasts, whose skins are much set by for facings for gownes. Of all kinds of birds it yeeldeth maruallous plenty, especially of water-foule, as is manifest by this, that in <HI>Canton,</HI> which is one of the least cities of this prouince, there are spent euery day vpon their Tables tenne or twelue thousand Ducks and Geese. They sow the drier ground with wheat and barly: the wet, plaine or moorish grounds, withe rise: which they cut or reap foure times in a yeare: this is their chiefest diet and liuing. The higher and steep places and sides of hilles are beset with Pine-trees: amongst the which they sow panicke, and pulse or horsecorne. There is no place therefore, no field, no plot of ground vnfruitfull. Euery where are Or∣chards, Gardens, Fruits, Roses, Floures, of all sorts yeelding a most fragrant and pleasant smell and goodly shew to the beholders. They plant flax in great abundance euery where, whereof they make diuers sorts of linnen, whereof they make their apparell: but especially Sugar canes, (which heere groweth in maruellous great abundance) and the Mulbery trees for the feeding of their silke wormes which are maintained with the leaues of this tree. Tor <HI>Silke</HI> is the chifest merchandise and commodity, whereof they raise yearely an infinite gaine and profit. There are in this kingdome 240. goodly cities, the names of which do all generally end in the syllable <HI>fu,</HI> which in their language signifieth a city; as <HI>Cantonfu, Panquinfu.</HI> The townes whereof there is infinite number, they likewise end in <HI>Cheu.</HI> Villages which are not to be numbred, by reason of the continuall husbandry and tillage, are very po∣pulous and wonderfully inhabited. All their cities for the most part, are situate vpon the banke of some great and nauigable streame, fortified with broad and deep ditches, and very high strong walles. These wals from the foundation vpward, are made of stone; toward the toppe and battlement, with bricke, laid in steed of lime and mortar, with lome or potters clay, the same stuffe, I meane, whereof the <HI>China</HI> dishes, so much esteemed of amongst vs, are made. The height of them and thicknesse is so great, that fiue or six men may walke a breast vpon the toppe of them. Vpon the wall are placed heere and there certaine high towers and bulwarkes, out of which they may see all the fields ouer farre and neere round about. On ech side of the wals so much vacant ground (<HI>pomoerium</HI> the Latines call it) is least, that horsemen may passe them six and six in a rancke in battell aray. These wals are so close and soundly wrought without any rifts or chinks, that one would thinke them to haue been but newly made, when as their histories do testifie them to haue been built two thousand yeares since. The entrance into the cities is by great gates most won∣derfully and stately built. Their streets are as smooth and precisely plaine, as if they were altogether made by line and leuell, and are so large and broad that tenne yea fifteene horsemen may ride a breast through them, which in many and sundry places are par∣ted and seuered with stately triumphall arches, gracing the cities beyond all measure. Certaine Portugals do report that they saw in the city <HI>Fucho</HI> a turrette, standing vpon forty marble pillars, whose height were forty hand breadth, and the thickenesse twelue after the measure which the Architects vse. This, (they affirme in their iudgement) for greatnesse, for exquisite workemanship, beauty and costlinesse, doth farre exceed all the stately buildings of all <HI>Europe.</HI> The greatnesse of their cities we do gather by this, that they say the city <HI>Canton,</HI> which we said was one of the least of their cities, is twelue English miles in compasse; beside 355. suburbes which do belong to it, very great and populous. The people are broad and round faced, thinne haired, flatte nosed, and small eied: although there be some amongst them reasonable well fauoured and handsome men. The colour of their faces is some∣what like that of those which inhabite <HI>Europe,</HI> yet those which dwell about <HI>Canton</HI> are of a browne complexion. They seldome or neuer trauell further than their owne country, neither will they easily suffer a stranger to dwell amongst them, especially in the vpland places, except they be publikely sworne to be true vnto the King and Country. The wealthy and better sort of men haue all their apparell made of silke of diuers and sundry colours. The base and meaner sort do weare a kind of stuffe made of white or blacke cotton, and sometime linnen coloured or stained with party colours; for as yet in these parts they know not how to make wollen cloth. The men there, as women do heere, do weare their haire long, which they winde vp in a knot to the crowne of their head, where they bind and fasten it with a siluer bodkin. The women comb their haire very trimly, and do behang and set it out with gold spangles and diuers kind of pearles and pretious stones. They paint and besmeare their faces with complexion, such as the Spanish women do commonly vse. They neuer once looke out of dores, except they be carried in their littars vpon mens shoulders, and attended by all the family.</P>
<P>It is lawfull for the men to marry many wiues, of which they keep but one in the house, the other they maintaine at boord a∣broad in other places. Those which are conuict of adultery, are put to death. Within the city there may be no stewes, the courti∣zanes do liue altogether in the suburbes without the wals. Weddings are alwaies kept in the new moone or beginning of the moneth, and that for the most part on the first day of <HI>March,</HI> which is their New-yeares-day, or first day of the yeare. These feasts they set out, like as we also do, very sumptuously and with as great preparation and prouision as may be gotten and diuised. Their chambers are hanged and spread with hangings of silke and rich tapestry, flowres are strewed and cast in euery corner. This feast is held and continued for many daies together. At them they haue musicke and all sorts of instruments, with Interludes and stage plaies. At these bankets they eat and drinke so soundly, that in this euen the very Dutchmen and Flemings themselues do not much exceed them. Their meat they do not touch with their hands, but with a siluer forke or hooke they put it into their mouthes. They sit at their meat or tables in chaires or on stooles, as heere we do in <HI>Europe,</HI> not vpon the ground, as the rest of the Asians vse. It is a very witty and ingenious people, so that they haue deuised and framed certaine waggons, which they can skil∣fully guide in the fields and champion plaines, driuen and forced by sailes and windes, like as shippes are vpon the sea. These peo∣ple haue had the vse and art of Printing of bookes, long before it was knowen to vs heere in <HI>Europe,</HI> the West part of the world. And there being in this country, by reason of the largenesse of the same, many and sundry people speaking distinct and different languages, one vnderstanding another no more than the Castilliand th the Biscaines, or the Germane doth the Frenchmen; yet by their maner of writing and characters which they all in common do vse, they do one know anothers mind passing well. Therefore all the inhabitants of the prouinces of this kingdome, as also those of <HI>Cauchinchina,</HI> and in the <HI>Lequeio's</HI> (certaine ilands vpon this coast) do vse one and the same alphabet (as they call it) or rather a kind of draught of letters (not much vnlike the <HI>Hiero∣glyphickes,</HI> of the Egyptians) whereby they do most cunningly and readily expresse euery thing and phrase or maner of speech. For example; a city or towne (the one he calleth <HI>Leombi,</HI> the other <HI>Fu</HI>) all do expresse this word by this marke <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. In like

For they haue in that their alphabet aboue fiue thousand characters of things and words. <HI>Gaspar Balbus,</HI> in his Iournall of <HI>India,</HI> writeth, except he iest, that they haue sixty thousand sundry characters. In writing or printing they do not begin at the left hand and so go on to the right, as we do: nor contrariwise, as the Iewes and Arabians vse; but they begin at the toppe and so write down in a straight line vntill they come to the bottome of the page. This kingdome hath an infinite number of all sorts of gallies, boats and barges, whereby they passe ouer riuers and armes of the sea: so that when they will brag of their Kings wealth and shew his power and command, they vse in a prouerbe to say, that he can make a bridge of shippes so long that it shall reach from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Malacha:</HI> which are more than 500. leagues asunder. For the country abutring vpon the sea, and being euery way and in many places watered and crossed by diuers great and nauigable riuers, there are almost as many people that dwell in boats vpon the water, as there do in houses vpon the land. Some there are, which neuer go out of their boats or barges, but continually staying in them, do by fishing and fowling get their liuing all the yeare long: for, as we said before: the abundance of fish and fowles heere in this country is admirable. Although this prouince be beyond all measure fertile of all maner of liuing creatures, yet they do helpe this fertility by art and this strange inuention: In the Spring time they couer two or three thousand egges with horse dung, (like as they vse in <HI>Alcairo</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI>) by the heat of which, in a certaine time, goslings and chickins are hatched and brought sorth. The like they do in the winter, but then they lay them not in dung, but putting them into a basket made of reeds, &amp; so setting them ouer a soft and moderat fire, which they keep continually burning in the same temper, whereby, in a certaine number of daies, they bring the same to passe as afore. They haue also this kind of fishing: in those cities which stand vpon the bankes and sides of riuers (as almost all the cities of this kingdome do) they keep a great number of Cormorants or sea-guls (the Latines call them <HI>Mergi,</HI> the Spaniards <HI>Sea crowes</HI>) in cages or coupes: these, when they list to go a fishing, they put into their boats, and carying them to the deepest places of the riuer, and there binding their necks lightly with cords (least that the fishes which they catch should go into their bellies) they cast them by multitudes into the water, where they let them stay so long, vntill they see their croppes to be filled with fishes, and then they returning to their boats, they are let in and there they cast vp at their masters feet all the fish they haue caught. This they do as oft as the fishermen please: and then being brought vnto their coupes, their neckes are vntied, and their ordinary meat is giuen to eat while they will. All this whole country is subiect to one King, (as to a Mo∣narch) whom they call <HI>The Lord of the World,</HI> and <HI>The Sonne of Heauen. Paquin,</HI> a city in the North parts of this kingdome, toward the confines of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> is the seat of their King, where he ordinarily keepeth his Court. Out of this he neuer goeth, except in time of warre. His predecessours did sometime keep their court in the city <HI>Manquin,</HI> for a remembrance whereof a golden Table is there very religiously preserued. In this the name of the King, which now raigneth, is written: before it is hanged a very rich curtaine, which is neuer drawen but vpon festiuall and holy daies, when as they do reuerence it very superstitiously, as if it did indeed represent the very Maiesty of the King himselfe. They report that when he maketh warre at any time against the Tartars, that he leadeth out into the field at the least three hundred thousand footmen, and two hundred thousand horsemen: yet this also they adde, that it is no very warlike Na∣tion. The King hath vnder him a gouernour, as it were a lieutenant, whom they call <HI>Tutan.</HI> This lieutenant is the iudge and determi∣ner of all causes and controuersies arising between man and man through-out the whole kingdome. In the execution of iustice he vseth great seuerity. Theeues and murderers are kept in perpetuall imprisonment, vntill they end their liues either by whipping, hunger or cold. Although they be condemned to suffer the greatest punishment that their law doth inflict (which for the most part is whipping) yet the execution of the sentence is so slow, that the greatest part of these condemned men do die in prison and neuer come to execution. Hence it is that there euery where in all their cities such an infinite number of prisoners, so that in <HI>Canton,</HI> one of their least cities is there are oftentimes more than fifteen thousand men in prison at once. Robberies, (than which fault, in these countries, there is none coun∣ted more odious) are punished by a cruell kind of whipping. The maner of this whipping is thus: They set the party to be whipped, with his face downe-ward, and his hands bound behind him: then he is beaten with a whippe, made of a reed or cane, vpon the calues of his legges, with such mighty blowes, that the bloud for the most part followeth at the first stroke; the second blow doth so torment the party to be punished that he cannot possibly stand vpon his feete any longer. Seuerall hangmen do whip, one one legge, and another another; and that so hard that many do die of the fifteenth or sixteenth lash: for all their sinewes are by this time burst asunder. The Portugals do affirme that euery yeare in this country there die aboue two thousand of this kind of death. This whippe is fiue fingers broad, and an inch thicke, which euery foote they dippe in water, to make it the more pliant, and to strike the greater blow.</P>
<P>Concerning the faith and religion of this nation, it is thus: They do beleeue all earthly creatures and all things in the World, and the gouernment and disposition of them, to depend of <HI>Heauen</HI> and Heauenly powers. For they do thinke that <HI>Heauen</HI> is the greatest of all Gods; and therefore the character of it possesseth the first place of their alphabet. They worship the Sunne, the Moone and the Stars, yea the very Diuell himselfe, (which they paint in the same forme, as wee do heere in <HI>Europe</HI>) that hee may do them no hurt, as they say. They haue stately and sumptuous Churches, aswell in the country, as in their cities. They haue also two sorts of Priests: the one sort go in white, with their heads shauen, and liue by begging, as our Friars do: the other goeth in blacke, wearing their haire long, and dwell by themselues, as our Priests vse to do heere in <HI>Europe.</HI> Neither of them may marrie, yet they liue very wantonly and licentiously. Thus farre out of <HI>Scalantus.</HI> It will not be amisse to these to adde some things out of others. <HI>Iohn Barry</HI> in his Asian Decades giueth out, that this king hath vnder him fifteen very great and large countries; which they call Gouernments. And moreouer he addeth, that this King alone doth farre surpasse all the rest of the Princes of <HI>Asia</HI> round about him: and that his yearely renenews do exceed all the riches and wealth of all <HI>Europe.</HI> For handy-craft trades and occupations they do excell all men liuing, their works are so finely and cun∣ningly made, that one would iudge them to haue been framed by nature, and not by art and industrie of man. At the city <HI>Nimpo,</HI> which others call <HI>Liampo,</HI> he saith it hath been obserued that some of the Portugals in the space of three moneths, haue bought and shipped a∣way 166000. pounds of silke. <HI>Odoardus Barbosa</HI> writeth, that the people are very kind and humane, and go apparelled much like the Dutchmen, whom also they do much resemble in pronunciation and maner of speech. Those cleare and transparent vessels, or dishes as white as the drift snow, which amongst vs are of such great estimation, are heere made in this maner: They mingle certaine cochle∣shels eg-shels &amp; other things together, which they knead &amp; make into a paste. This paste they hide in the earth, where they let it li for the space of fourescore, or an hundred yeares, before they stirre it or looke to it again, leauing it, as a great inheritance or pretious iewell, vnto their heires. That paste they vse which their grandfathers or great grandfathers haue laied vp for them. And they do obserue duely by an ancient custome, that he which taketh away the old paste, do put new presently in his place. <HI>Antony Pigafetta,</HI> calleth this King the most mighty Prince of the whole world. He saith that his palace, or house where he keepeth his Court, is enclosed with 7. wals; and that he hath alwaies 10000. souldiers for his gard continually there attendant vpon him: and that 70. crowned Kings do homage vnto him and are subiect to his gouernment and command. The same authour affirmeth that <HI>Muske</HI> is from hence transported into diuers parts of the world. <HI>Andrew Corsalis</HI> he likewise saith that the greatest store of <HI>Rheubarbe</HI> and <HI>Pearle</HI> that is brought hither to vs in <HI>Europe,</HI> doth come from hence.</P>
<P>In the Iesuites Epistles lately set forth in print, many things well worth the obseruation are heere and there set downe of this country. That of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> these people were called SINAE, the situation doth plainly proue, neither doth the name yet retained much differ from that. For the Spaniards and Portugals do write it <HI>Ch na,</HI> yet they pronounce it <HI>Sina.</HI> Of the situation and nature of this country, the be∣hauiours and maners of the people, you may read in a worke of <HI>Iohn Gonsalis</HI> set forth of this argument. Of the same also read the letters of the Iesuites afore mentioned, and <HI>Ferd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nando Lopez:</HI> but especially the sixth booke of <HI>Maffeius de rebus Indicis.</HI> Lastly, the nienth chapter of the ninth booke of the first part of the choice Library of <HI>Posseuinus.</HI></P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Ohn Peter Maffey,</HI> in the twelfth booke of his history of <HI>India</HI> doth thus write of this iland: They are especially three greater ilands, with many other smaller round about them, disioined one from another by very narrow straits or armes of the sea, that are called by the name of IAPAN or <HI>Iaponia.</HI> The first and the greatest is diuided into three and fifty signiories or kingdomes: the head and chiefe city of this is <HI>Meaco,</HI> whereof this whole iland taketh his name. The second is named <HI>Ximen,</HI> and conteineth nine kingdomes: the more famous cities of the kingdome of <HI>Bungo,</HI> are <HI>Vosuqui</HI> and <HI>Funay.</HI> The third iland is called <HI>Xicocum:</HI> it conteineth not aboue foure kingdomes or signio∣ries: it is beautified with the goodly city <HI>Tonsa (Tosa</HI> he calleth it) of the same name with the king∣dome: Thus the regiments or kingdomes of <HI>Iapan</HI> are in all generally sixty and six; beside diuers other iurisdictions which cannot iustly be called kingdomes. The length of the whole maine land is, as they say, almost two hundred leagues: the breadth is nothing so much: for in some places it is not aboue tenne leagues broad: at the most it is not aboue thirty leagues ouer. Of the compasse there is nothing certainly written that I know of. It runneth out from the South toward the North from the thirty degree of latitude almost to the thirty and eight. Vpon the East it is opposite to <HI>New-Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne,</HI> remote from it not aboue 150. leagues. Vpon the North it hath the Scythians or Tartari∣ans, and other such people exceeding rude and barbarous. On the West lieth <HI>China, (Sinarum regno)</HI> in some place neerer, in some place further off, according to the diuers windings and bendings of the shore: for from the city <HI>Liampo,</HI> which is the vt∣termost bound of <HI>China,</HI> toward the West, vnto <HI>Gotum, (Ogoto,</HI> I thinke) which is the first Iland of all <HI>Iapan</HI> that offereth it selfe to the view of those which saile from thence hitherward, is not aboue threescore leagues but from <HI>Amacan,</HI> a mart town in the West, where the Portugals for the most part do altogether vse to trade, vnto the same <HI>Gotum,</HI> the cutte is 297. leagues ouer. On the South, neere hand it hath naught but the vast and wide Ocean; further off, certaine lands and countries not yet descried or knowne, out of which, the report goeth, that certaine sailours came once by chance vnto <HI>Iapan,</HI> and neuer put off from thence any more to returne backe to their natiue soile. The country for the most part is full of snow all the yeare long, bleake and cold, and therefore not very fertile. In September they cut downe their rise, in some places they reap their wheat in May: (for this generally is the vsuall food throughout the whole country) yet they make no bread of it, as we vse heere in <HI>Europe,</HI> but a kind of pudding or pappe, which they eat in stead of bread. The temperature of the aire is very kind and whole∣some: their fresh waters are passing good: they haue also some bathes or springs of hot waters of soueraigne vertues in Phy∣sicke, as some do constantly report. High and steep mountaines they haue many heere and there, but two are especially fa∣mous, the one of which, whose name I know not, doth continually burne and cast out flames of fire, as <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicilia</HI> was wont to do, and as <HI>Hecla</HI> in <HI>Island</HI> now vsually doth at certaine times. In the toppe of this mountaine, the Diuell, enclosed in a white clowd, sheweth himselfe to certaine men, after that for deuotions sake they haue long fasted and pined themselues. The other, called <HI>Figenoiama,</HI> ariseth vp certaine leagues aboue the cloudes. The people do digge sundry sorts of mettals out of the bowels of the earth, whereby they intice forren Nations to come from farre vnto their quarters. Trees they haue both for pleasure and for profit or fruit not much vnlike ours heere in <HI>Europe:</HI> yet there is one tree, which doth much resemble the Palme-tree, whose nature is very strange: for, as they affirme, it is afraid of any maner of moisture: and if so be by chance it happen to be wette, it shrinketh together, and as if it had been infected with the plague, smitten or blasted, it withereth and dieth immediately. The helpe and meanes to recouer it againe, is to plucke it vp by the roots and to drie it in the sunne: then to lay it in a dry ditch or empty pit, and to couer it all ouer, either with the rust of iron beaten to powder, or else with sand: there, after it is planted and set into the ground againe, it groweth and buddeth as afore, and so it flourisheth and becommeth as trimme and beautifull as euer it was: the boughes also that fall off, or are broken off, if they be fastened with a naile vnto the stocke or body of the tree, they will grow and ioine to the same aswell as if they had beene grafted into it. Heere are euery where great store of Cedar trees, of such height and thickenesse, that hereof the carpenters make summers for houses, pillars and columnes for stately buildings, and the shipwrights masts for the talest and greatest shippes of burden that in those quar∣ters they vsually make. Sheep, hogges, hennes, ducks, geese, and such other filthy kinds of liuing creatures they seldome or neuer keep at home about their houses: if they please to eat flesh meat, they only eat venison, and such as they catch abroad in the wild fields. The fields are bespread with many heards of cattell, as kine and horses for seruice in the warres: in the forrests, woods and bushie grounds, woolues, conies, bores, stagges and other deere do wander vp and downe: they haue plenty of phesants, wild ducks, stock-doues, quailes and wild hennes: fishes of diuers sorts, but especially of riuer trouts, (or silares as some call them) as also of sea troutes which is not vnlike that kind of fish which <HI>Ausonius</HI> nameth <HI>Alosa,</HI> and <HI>Pliny Clupea</HI> or <HI>Clypea,</HI> in the fifteenth chapter of his ninth booke: this they set great store by and do account it for a dainty dish. They know not what butter meaneth; oile of oliues they haue none; but they make a kind of artificiall oile of the Whales which they catch or are cast vp vpon this shore: the common sort of people do vse most what boughs or sticks of pine-trees, in some place straw and hawme, in steed of candles. If any one be tall or properly made, he is not a little proud of it. Many of them liue long, and are strong and lusty euen to the last, so that the most of them are fit for the warres till they be threescore yeares old. They weare their beards short: but in the rest of their haire they are very curious and haue diuers and sundry cuttes: they shaue them not, but plucke them off with pullesans or pinsers; the Boies do bare their heads from the forehead euen vp to the crowne: the baser sort of people and the clownes, the one halfe of the same: the gentlemen and noblemen, almost all ouer, onely leauing a few haires behind about the nape of the necke, which they hold for a great disgrace if any man shall lay hand vpon, or once offer to touch. Hunger, thirst, heat, cold, labour and such like inconueniences, that do much trouble other men, they can well away withall and most patiently endure. As soone as euer they be borne and come into the world, al∣though it be in the midde winter, they be straight caried to a riuer to be washed: being weaned and taken from the breast, they are exercised in hunting, and are kept apart in rough and craggy places farre from their mothers and nurces wings; for they thinke that there is nothing that doth more effeminate the minds of men, than too tender and delicate bringing vp. They bespread and couer the floores of their houses with fine and neat mattes, rising and swelling as matrices or flockebeds. Vpon these, laying a stone or blocket vnder their heads, in steed of a pillow, they sleep and take their rest: and vpon the same, kneeling vpon their knees and sitting vpon their legges, they dine and suppe. They are as neat and cleanly as those of <HI>China:</HI> at their meat they do so cunningly put their meat into their mouthes with two little pricks or forkes, that they neuer droppe or let ought fall beside, nor need once to wipe their fingers. They put off their shoes when they go to meat, least they should soile their carpets by treading vpon them The poorer sort, especially those that dwell vpon the sea, do liue by herbs, rise, and fish: the wealthier sort do set out their banquets richly and with great variety of dishes: at euery messe ech mans trencher

<PB REF="226"/> made of Cedar, or Pine-wood, of an handfull thicke, is changed without table-clothes or napkins. The meats, when they are to be set vpon the table, are built, or laid vpon another informe of a steeple or pyramis, bestrewed with gold, and stucke and set out for a shew with branches of the Cypresse tree, like as we vse to do with Rose-mary. Many times whole fowles are brought to Noblemens tables, with their bils and legs gilt all ouer. They intertaine their friends and guests very kindlie and bountifullie. They haue many orders and lawes of feasting and drinking, which are performed very curiouslie &amp; with strange and exquisite ceremonies. They haue no manner of wine, nor vines amongst them. A kind of artificiall wine they make and presse out of rise: yet they are especially delighted, more than with any other kind of liquor, to drink water almost scalding hot, putting it into the powder of an hearb which they call <HI>Chia,</HI> (it is a very wholesome hearb of soueraigne vertues) this kind of drinke they vse often and are curious in the making of it; so that many times Princes and Noblemen, will dresse, prepare and mingle it with their owne hands, for an honour and grace vnto their friends: and they haue certaine places in their houses assigned to this purpose: in which there is a furnace or fire kindled at all times readie, with a kettle of cast iron continually hanging ouer the same: from hence they fetch drinke to entertaine their friends at their first comming to their house, and for their farewell at their departure: when their guests are to depart, they shew them all their treasure and houshold-stuffe which they do especially esteeme; which for the most part is nothing else but those vessels and instruments belonging to the making of the drinke which I spake of before, namely the furnace or hearth, the panne or kettle with the trefeet, the tunnell, the drink∣ing cuppes or earthen pots, the spoones, and the boxes wherein they keep the hearb and the powder made of the same. These things they set little lesse store by, than we do heere in <HI>Europe</HI> by rings beset with pretious stones or bracelets of the best and most orient pearles. Their houses for the most part are framed of timber, to auoid the danger of earth-quakes, which heere are very frequent and often, although that some haue their houses very artificially and stately built from the foundation vpward of a very faire kind of stone. They haue many goodly Churches, and Monasteries both of men and wo∣men, very rich and sumptuous. The language of all these ilands is one and the same, but so diuers and manifold, and of such different dialects, that it may not vniustly be said to be many. For they haue of one and the same thing diuers and sundrie names, of which some are vsed in scorne and bad sense, others in good sense and honourable vsage: other phrases and words are vsed by the Nobility, others by the common people: others are spoken by the men, others by the women. Moreouer, they speake otherwise than they write: and in their writing there is a great variety, for they write their priuate letters vnto their friends one way, and bookes and such like another way. They haue diuers bookes, very fairely written, both in verse and in prose. Againe, their letters are such, as in one and the same character they do expresse and signifie sometime one word, sometime two or more. Lastly, the Iaponian language is, of indifferent iudges, preferred before the Latine, either in respect of the elegancy and smoothnesse of pronunciation, or copy and variety of the same: therefore it requireth both great time and labour to learne it. They are a very warlike people and much giuen to follow that kind of life: the chiefe men of dignitie, which haue the command of the kingdome and gouernment of the same, they generally call <HI>Tonos;</HI> although amongst those there are also certaine degrees, as there are amongst our Nobility, Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, and Barons. Another sort of men there are amongst them, which haue the charge and managing of matters of their Church: these are shauen all ouer both head and beard: these may neuer marrie, but do vow perpetuall chastity. There are diuers and sundrie sects of these religious persons amongst them: some there are which after the maner of the Knights of the Rhodes, do iointly professe armes and religion together, but they are generally called by one name, <HI>Bonzij.</HI> They haue in many places diuers great schooles, such as we call Vniuersities. The third state or sort of people amongst them, are the citizens and other degrees of gentry: next vnto these are the retalers, hucksters, factours, and shop-keepers: with artificers and handiecraft-men, of diuers occupations, very ingenious and skilfull in their trades. They haue many kinds of armours and warlike weapons, made of sundrie makings, and excellent temper. They haue also the vse of Printing with letters and stamps, not much vnlike our ma∣ner inuented and practised heere in <HI>Europe.</HI> The last sort and state of people in these ilands, are the husbandmen and labou∣rers. Generally it is a very subtile, wittie and wise Nation, and of singular endowments and good parts of nature, both for acute iudgement, aptnesse of learning, and excellency of memorie. It is no shame or reproach to any to be accounted poore. Slaunderous and railing speeches, theeuing, robberies and that vngodlie kind of rash othes and swearing, with all kind of di∣cing and gaming, they do vtterly abhorre and detest. Any offendours against the Law, of what degree soeuer, are punished by no lesse punishment, than banishment, confiscation of goods or death. Those which are to be executed are for the most part beheaded suddenlie before they are aware. Notwithstanding it is the maner in some places to cary, such as are taken for robberies, in a certaine kind of carre round about the city, in the face of all the people, and to hang them vp without the wals of the towne. In the seruice of God, which is the chiefe point of iustice and vertue, they do miserably erre and swarue from the right tract. Their guides and great masters of religion to informe the rest, are those which I say they name <HI>Bonzij.</HI> A∣mongst their saints which they worship, the chiefe are those which they call <HI>Amida</HI> and <HI>Xaca:</HI> other idols they haue of lesse estimation and note amongst them, whom they pray vnto for health, recouery in sickenesse, children, money, &amp; other things belonging to the body: these they call <HI>Camis.</HI> All <HI>Iaponia,</HI> or the people of that name, were subiect in time past vnto one Em∣perour, whom they called <HI>Vo</HI> or <HI>Dair,</HI> (this was his title of honour and dignity) vntill such time as he growen effeminate and giuen to pleasures and ease, became to be scorned and contemned by the Lieutenants and Nobility, especially of the <HI>Cubi</HI> (for so they called the two chiefest Princes vnto whom the gouernment of the country was committed, of which afterward the one did kill the other) therefore the Lieutenants of the seuerall shires, with the military men, hauing for a time endured such a carpet Knight, by and by began to loath his gouernment, and at last wholly shaking off the yoke of subiection, seised euery man into his owne hand the prouince ouer which he was set as gouernour vnder the Emperour: so at an instant that vnited body and maine Empire of so large command, was shattered as it were into many parts and pieces: yet so as notwithstanding a kind of soueraigne authority doth euen to this day remaine in the <HI>Dair,</HI> of distributing and giuing the titles of honour to the Nobility, which eftsoones are altered according to the diuersity of the degrees, and are designed by certaine notes and bad∣ges. The chiefe and most mightie of all the Princes of <HI>Iaponia</HI> is he that gat either by force or policy <HI>Meacum,</HI> and the best kingdomes neere to the same, which they generally by one name do vulgarly call <HI>Tensa.</HI> Those places were lately possessed by <HI>Nubunanga,</HI> that tyrant which I spake of before: this King being slaine by treason about two yeares before, and his chil∣dren murdered or banished, one <HI>Faxiba</HI> a chiefe captaine of the rebels, by force and violence stepped into his regall throne, and tooke vpon him to sway the scepter of that kingdome.</P>
<P>The honour and credit of the first entrance of this Iland certaine Portugals do challenge and take vnto themselues, but I do rather giue credit to <HI>Antonio Gaualno,</HI> who reporteth, in that booke which he wrote of the descries of the New-found world, that <HI>Anton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Mota, Francisco Zeimoro,</HI> and <HI>Antonio Pexoto,</HI> in their iourney as they sailed from the city <HI>Dodra</HI> in <HI>Sion,</HI> to passe for <HI>China,</HI> they were caried by a contrary wind to the Ilands of the Iaponians, about two and forty yeares before that time. All this we haue extracted out of the forenamed <HI>Maffeius,</HI> who handleth them more at large, with many other things of these Ilands of <HI>Iaponia.</HI> Of the same there are heere and there many things in the Iesuites Epistles.</P>

<HEAD>INDIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat there is not a more goodly and famous country in the world, nor larger, comprehen∣ded vnder one and the same name than INDIA, almost all writers iointly with one con∣sent haue affirmed. It was so named of the riuer <HI>Indus.</HI> The whole compasse of <HI>India</HI> by the iudgement of <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> is thus limited: vpon the West, it hath the riuer <HI>Indus;</HI> on the North, the great mountaine <HI>Taurus;</HI> on the East, the Eastern sea, wherein those fa∣mous Ilands, the <HI>Moluccaes,</HI> do lie; on the South, it hath the Indian sea. In the middest it is diuided into two large prouinces by the goodly riuer <HI>Ganges.</HI> Of which that which is on the West side of <HI>Ganges,</HI> is called <HI>India intra Gangem, India</HI> on this side <HI>Ganges:</HI> that on the East, <HI>India extra Gangem, India</HI> beyond <HI>Ganges.</HI> That in holy Scripture it is called EVILAT or <HI>Hauila:</HI> this latter some writers call SERIA, the country of the <HI>Seres,</HI> as <HI>Dominicus Niger</HI> testifieth. M. <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> seemeth to diuide it into three prouinces, the <HI>Greater,</HI> the <HI>Lesser,</HI> and the <HI>Middlemost;</HI> which he saith they name <HI>Abasia.</HI></P>
<P>This whole country generally, not only for multitude of nations (of which, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> writeth, it is most populous and best stored of any country in the world) and for townes and villages almost infinite, but for the great abundance of all commodities (only brasse and lead excepted, if one may giue credit to <HI>Pliny</HI>) is most rich and fortunate. It hath very many riuers, and those very great and faire. These running to and fro and in many places crossing and watering the same, do cause it, as in a moist soile, where the sunne is of force, to bring forth all things most plentifully. It storeth all the world with Spices, Pearles and Pretious stones, as hauing greater plenty of these commodities than all the countries of the whole world besides.</P>
<P>There are neere vnto this country many goodly ilands, which heere and there lie scattering in the maine Ocean, so that it may iustly be tearmed the <HI>World of Ilands.</HI> But especially IAPAN, which M. <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> calleth <HI>Zipangri,</HI> situate in this sea, is worth the noting: which, because it is not many yeares since that it was knowen to few or none, I thinke it not amisse to say something of it in this place. It is a very large and wide iland, and hath almost the same eleuation of the Northren pole and position from the South with <HI>Italy.</HI> The Ilanders and people heere inhabiting, are much giuen to learning, wisedome and religion: and are most earnest and diligent sear∣chers out of the truth in naturall causes. They vse to pray and say seruice oft, which they do in their Churches in the same maner as the Christians do. They haue but one King, vnto whom they are subiect and do nothing but according to his behests and lawes. Yet he also hath one aboue him, whom they call <HI>Voo,</HI> to whom the or∣dering of Ecclesiasticall matters &amp; gouernment of the state of the Church is soly committed. This peraduenture we may not vnfitly compare to the Pope, as their King to the Emperour. To their Bishop they commit the sal∣uation and care of their soules. They worship only one God, protraitured with three heads, yet they can shew no reason of this act. They baptize their infants: by fasting, in token of penance, they labour to bring downe their bodies. They crosse and blesse themselues with the signe of the crosse, against the assault of Satan: so that in religion, certaine ceremonies, and maner of liuing they seeme to imitate the Christians: yet notwithstanding the order of the Iesuites labour by all meanes possibly they can, not refusing any paines and trauell, to reduce them wholly to Christianity.</P>
<P>Heere are also the MOLVCCAE, certaine ilands famous for the abundance of spices which they yearly yeeld and send into all quarters of the world. In these is bred the <HI>Manucodiatta,</HI> a little bird which we call the bird of Paradise, a strange fowle no where els euer seen. More neere the coast of <HI>India,</HI> is SVMATRA, or rather <HI>Samotra,</HI> for so the King himselfe of that country, writeth it, in his letters vnto his Maiesty: this Iland was knowen to the ancient Geographers and Historians by the name of TAPROBANA. There are also diuers other Ilands heere∣about of great estimation and fame, as <HI>Iaua Maior, Iaua Minor, Borneo, Timor &amp;c.</HI> as thou maist see in the Mappe, but we cannot in this place speake of euery thing particularly and to the full. Thus farre the religion of Maho∣met is professed, and from <HI>Barbary</HI> ouer against <HI>Spaine,</HI> euen vnto this place is the Arabicke language spoken or vnderstood. The Moores from <HI>Marrocco,</HI> Ambassadours to our late Queene some fiue yeares since, we saw and heard them speake that tongue naturally, in which also their commission or letters patents were written: From <HI>Achem</HI> in <HI>Samotra,</HI> and <HI>Bantam</HI> in <HI>Iaua Maior</HI> our Merchants, this other day brought letters vnto his Highnesse, so fairely and curiously written in that character and language, as no man will scarcely beleeue but he that hath seen them, especially from so barbarous and rude a Nation.</P>
<P>Of the ancient writers <HI>Diodorus Siculus, Herodotus, Pliny, Strabo, Quintus Curtius</HI> and <HI>Arrianus</HI> in the life of <HI>Alexan∣der,</HI> haue described the <HI>Indies.</HI> So hath <HI>Apuleius</HI> also in the first booke of his <HI>Floridorum. Dion Prusaeus</HI> in his 35. ora∣tion hath written much of this country, but very fabulously. There is also extant an Epistle of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, written to <HI>Aristotle,</HI> of the situation of <HI>India.</HI> Of the latter writers <HI>Ludouicus Vartomannus, Maximilianus Trans∣siluanus, Iohannes Barrius</HI> in his Decades of <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Cosmas Indopleutes,</HI> whom <HI>Petrus Gyllius</HI> doth cite, haue done the same. But see the Iesuites Epistles, where thou shalt find many things making much for the discouery of the ile <HI>Iapan.</HI> But if thou desire a full and absolute description of the same, I would wish thee to haue recourse vnto the twelfth booke of <HI>Maffeius</HI> his Indian history. <HI>Iohn Macer,</HI> a Ciuillian hath also written bookes of the history of <HI>India,</HI> in which he hath much of the ile <HI>Iaua.</HI> Moreouer <HI>Castagnedo</HI> a Spaniard, hath written in the Spanish tongue a discourse of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Of the ilands which lie scattering heere and there in this ocean, read the twentieth booke of the second Tome of <HI>Gonsaluo Ouetani,</HI> written in like maner in the Spanish tongue.</P>

<HEAD>The kingdome of PERSIA, OR The Empire of the SOPHIES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Empire of the Persians as it hath alwaies in former ages been most famous, so at this day still it is very renowmed, knowen farre and neere, and conteineth ma∣ny large and goodly prouinces: For all that whole tract of <HI>Asia</HI> comprehended be∣tween the great riuer <HI>Tigris,</HI> the Persian gulfe, the Indian (which of old writers was called <HI>mare Rubrum,</HI> the Red sea) the riuers <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Iaxartes</HI> (they now call it <HI>Chesel</HI>) and the Caspian sea, is now in these our daies possessed by the <HI>Sophies,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Persia.</HI> All which tract of ground <HI>Pliny</HI> in the 27. chapter of his 6. booke of the history of Nature, by the iudgement of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> assigneth to the Medes, Parthians, and Persi∣ans. But <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> who liued in the time of <HI>Iulian</HI> the <HI>Apostata</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> doth ascribe it wholly to <HI>Persia.</HI> For he in his foure and twentith booke reckoneth vp these eighteen countries in this order, as parts of <HI>Persia; Assyria, Susiana, Media, Persis, Parthia, Carmania</HI> the Greater, <HI>Hyrcania, Margiana,</HI> the <HI>Bactri∣ani,</HI> the <HI>Sacae, Scythia</HI> beyond the mount <HI>Emodus</HI> (a part of the mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> the Iewes call it <HI>Iethra,</HI> others, <HI>Moghali,</HI> others <HI>Beresith,</HI> as <HI>Theuet</HI> reporteth) <HI>Scrica, Aria,</HI> the <HI>Paropamisadae, Drangiana, Arachosia</HI> and <HI>Gedrosia.</HI> All these countries euen at this day are subiect to the iurisdiction of the Kings of <HI>Persia,</HI> (for ought that I can learne either by the bookes of late writers, or relation of sailours and trauellers into those parts) yet the names are much altered and changed, as you shall easily perceiue by comparing of the moderne mappes and chartes, with the descriptions of ancient Geographers.</P>
<P>Of the originall of the SOPHIES, these particulars following, <HI>Caelius Secundus Curio,</HI> hath translated in his Saracen history, out of the Decades of <HI>Asia,</HI> written by <HI>Iohn Barrius:</HI> In the yeare of Christ 1369. there was a certaine pety king amongst the Persians, named <HI>Sophi,</HI> who held the city <HI>Ardenelim</HI> in his possession. This man bragged that he was descended lineally by his ancestours from <HI>Musa Cazino,</HI> nephew of <HI>Alij Muha∣med.</HI> He, the Chalife of <HI>Babylon</HI> being dead, &amp; the contrary faction maintained by the Turkes, suppressed by the Tartars, began more boldly and freely to broach his opinions of religion: and because that <HI>Hocemus,</HI> the sonne <HI>Aly,</HI> from whom he draweth his pedigree, had twelue sonnes, minding to set some marke or badge vpon his sect and disciples, whereby they might be distinguished and knowen from others, he ordained that they that would follow him, and be of his religion, should weare a tire vnder the vaile, which all the Turkes do wind about their heads (they call it <HI>Tulibant</HI>) should be of a purple colour, and should hang out at the middest of the <HI>Tulibant</HI> twelue hand breadth. After his death <HI>Guines</HI> his sonne succeeded in his steed: who did purchase vnto himselfe such an opinion of learning, religion and holinesse throughout all the Eastern countries of the World, that <HI>Tamerlanes,</HI> that worthy and famous Emperour of the Parthians, (who ouercame <HI>Bayazet,</HI> the great Turke, and defeating all his forces, tooke him captiue) trauelling through <HI>Persia,</HI> determined to visite him as a most holy and religious Saint. To <HI>Guines, Tamerlanes</HI> freely gaue thirtie thousand captiues, which he brought thither with him: these <HI>Guines</HI> afterward trained vp in his religion; whose seruice <HI>Secaidar</HI> his sonne, especially vsed in his warres: For he, after that <HI>Guines</HI> his father was dead, made warre vpon the Georgians, his neighbours bordering vpon his kingdome and countries, a kind of people of <HI>Scythia,</HI> but Christians by profession, and by the help of these Mussulmanes, grieuously vexed them many kind of waies &amp;c. Let this satisfie thee in this place to be spoken of the originall of the <HI>Sophies.</HI> These do make continuall warre with the Turkes about the Mahumetane religion: for because the <HI>Sophies</HI> do follow one interpretour of the Alkora'n and Mahometan religion, and the Turkes another, which in∣terpretours and expositours do much dissent and vary one from the other, so that the Sophians by the Turkes are counted but as Heretiques, and contrariwise the Turkes are esteemed for no lesse by the Sophi∣ans. It is by nature a Gentleman-like and honourable Nation, very ciuill and curteous, louing learning and liberall sciences, and withall do much esteeme of Nobility and Noble-men: in that are cleane contrary and opposite to the Turkes, which do not acknowledge or regard any difference of bloud or descent from fa∣mous ancestours and great houses.</P>
<P>The situation of these countries, the maners, customes and behauiour of the people of the same, thou maist read of in <HI>Aloysius Iohannes Venetus, Iosaphat Barbarus, Ambrosius Contarenus, Iohannes Maria Angiolellus,</HI> and a certaine Merchants trauels, whose name I know not, together with them imprinted. Looke into also the Iesuites Epistles, and the Persian Commentaries of <HI>Caterino Zeni,</HI> a Senatours sonne of <HI>Venice. Polybius</HI> in his fifth booke doth most excellently well describe the middle Country. Moreouer <HI>Petrus Bizarrus,</HI> my singu∣lar good friend, hath this other day set out the history of <HI>Persia.</HI> Lastly, and somewhat latter than <HI>Bizar∣rus, Thomas Minadoius</HI> hath done the like, but in the Italian tongue.</P>

<HEAD>The Empire of the Great TVRKE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F the originall and beginning of the Turkish Empire, the encreasing and grow'th of the same, vntill it came by little and little to that greatnesse that now it is of, whereby it is fearefull to all nations round about, we haue gathered these few lines out of the best Historiographers of our time. In the yeare of Christ 1300. one OTTOMAN∣NVS a Turke, the sonne of <HI>Zichi,</HI> a man of meane parentage, began for his pregnant witte and great experience in feats of armes and discipline of warre, to grow famous and renowmed amongst the Turkes. Of this man the stocke of the Turkish Empe∣rours first tooke their name and beginning, and he was the first that ordeined a king ouer the Turkes. He raigned seuen and twenty yeares, in which space he conquered all <HI>Bithynia</HI> and <HI>Cappa∣docia,</HI> and subdued many strong holds neere vnto <HI>Mar Maiore,</HI> or the great sea; so now the Italians call that sea which the old writers call <HI>Mare Ponticum</HI> and <HI>Sinus Euxinus,</HI> the Greekes now <HI>Maurothalassa,</HI> and the Turkes <HI>Caradenis,</HI> that is, the Blacke sea. After him succeeded his sonne ORCHANES, who wonne the great and strong city <HI>Prusia</HI> or <HI>Prusa,</HI> (now called, as <HI>Bellonius</HI> writeth <HI>Bource,</HI> and was sometime named <HI>Zellia</HI> and <HI>Theo∣politana</HI>) which he made the head of his kingdome and place of residence for his Court. He was slaine in an vnfortunate battell which he fought against the Tartars, in the 22. yeare of his raigne, and left AMVRATHES his sonne to rule the kingdome after him: who first, (the Grecian Princes falling at variance and calling him in) sailed with an huge army out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>Europe:</HI> he in a short space subdued almost all <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Pho∣cis</HI> a part of <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> but himselfe at last being ouercome and taken by <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> died and ended his daies most dishonourably. The father being taken, CALEPINVS his sonne stepped into the throne, and tooke possession of the kingdome.

He wonne by battery the great city of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> vpon the nine and twentith day of <HI>May</HI> in the yeare after the birth of Christ 1452. He subdued the kingdome of <HI>Trapezon∣da</HI> vnder his command. He tooke <HI>Corinth.</HI> He forced the ilands <HI>Lemnos (Stalamine</HI> they now call it) <HI>Euboea (Nigroponte)</HI> and <HI>Mitylene</HI> to yeeld to his obedience.

Hauing surprized the city, he besieged <HI>Zygeth,</HI> where he ended his life. ZELIMVS the second his sonne, continued the battery, wanne it and sacked it in the yeare of Christ 1566. And thus vnder 11. Emperours, in 260. yeares, a great part of <HI>Africa,</HI> a greater of <HI>Europe</HI> and the most of <HI>Asia</HI> was by Turkish tyranny, brought vnder their yoke.

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat which the ancients called</HI> Palestina <HI>and</HI> Phoenicia, <HI>all the Europeans generally now call The</HI> HOLY LAND, <HI>vnder which name they comprehend that whole country which God gaue vnto the Israelites by the name of the</HI> Land of Promise, <HI>to them and their seed to possesse and inhabite for euer, and which after the death of</HI> Solomon, <HI>we read, was diuided into two kingdomes,</HI> IVDAH, <HI>conteining two tribes</HI> Iudah <HI>and</HI> Beniamin, <HI>whose cheife or Metropolitan city was</HI> Ierusalem: <HI>and</HI> SAMARIA <HI>or</HI> ISRAEL, <HI>which comprehended the other tenne tribes, together with the city</HI> Sebaste <HI>or</HI> Samaria. <HI>A latter description of the modern situation of this country, very curious &amp; exact, done by</HI> F. Brocard <HI>in a seuerall treatise (vnto whom we send the Reader for further satisfaction) we offer in this Mappe: for the former tables did present vnto thy eie the ancient face and more beautifull countenance of this land. To him they may adioine, that please, the treatise of</HI> William Tyrius <HI>en∣tituled,</HI> The Holy warres, <HI>and other authours that haue written their Peregrinations to</HI> Hierusalem, <HI>of which sort there is a great number written and imprinted in diuers languages. For many Christians not only out of sundrie parts of</HI> Europe, <HI>but from all quarters of the world, haue in former times and now do daily trauell vnto</HI> Hierusalem, <HI>for deuotion to visite the holy sepulchre of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, and are there sometimes by the Franciscane Friars, dubbed Knights, who thereof are named</HI> Knights of the Sepulchre: <HI>the order &amp; ceremonies of making these Knights, we haue thought not altogether impertinent from our purpose, to describe in this place, as it is set out by</HI> Iod. a Meggē, <HI>an ei-witnes of that, in the</HI> 12 <HI>chap. of his treatise intituled,</HI> Peregrinatio Hierusolymetana. <HI>And thus he hath down the maner of it:</HI></P>
<P>First of all therefore the Knight that is to be made, prepareth himselfe vnto his deuotions, that he may receiue the fauour of the degree of the holy order, and making his confession (hauing heard Masse &amp; receiued the Sacrament) he is admitted into the roome where the holy sepulchre is, and then they begin on this manner: First, all being gathered together within the holy sepulchre, they sing this Psalme, <HI>Come holy spirit &amp;c.</HI> Then this, <HI>Send forth thy spirit &amp;c. The Answear.</HI> And renew &amp;c. Lord heare &amp;c. <HI>Let vs pray,</HI> Thou Lord, which know'st the harts of the faithful &amp;c. Then the Gardian demandeth of him, what wouldest thou haue? <HI>He answeareth vpon his knees,</HI> I do desire to be made a knight of the order of the Holy sepulchre of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. <HI>Question.</HI> Of what state and condition of life art thou of? <HI>Answear.</HI> A noble man, borne of honou∣rable parents. <HI>Question.</HI> Hast thou sufficient liuing whereby thou maist liue and maintaine the estate and dignity of knighthood, without the help of merchandise or vse of any mechanicall or handie-craft occupation? <HI>Answear.</HI> I haue, thankes be to God, sufficient liuing and maintenance by lands and reuenews. <HI>Question.</HI> Art thou prepared to sweare with hart and mouth, to keep and obserue, to the vttermost of thy power, those mi∣litarie sacraments and orders which shalbe heereafter inioined thee, namely these which follow? First, a knight of the holy order of the sepulchre must euery day, if opportunity be offered, heare a masse or diuine seruice. Secondly, when need requireth, viz. when there is any generall warre against the Pagans or Infidels, he must aduenture both body and goods in the quarrell of the Church; that is, he is bound either to go in his owne person, or to send thither of his charges, some one sufficient man or other. Thirdly, he is bound by that oath to defend and free, in as much as in him shall lie, the holy Church of God, and all the members of the same, from their persecutors, and from the enemies of Christianity. Fourthly, he must altogether shunne vniust warres, filthy lucre and hire, fencing, iusts, torneaments, combats and such like, but only for exercise and making of himselfe more fit for the sacred warre. Fifthly, he must procure peace and concord between faithfull Christian people, do his best to grace and enlarge the bounds of his country, defend orphanes and widdowes, he must carefully take heed of cursed oathes, periuries, blasphemies, rapes, v∣surie, sacriledge, murther, drunkennesse, suspected places, infamous persons, and to shunne and keep himselfe, (as from the deadly plague) from all those vices of the flesh that mortall man by nature is so much subiect vnto: and that he do so cary himselfe, that in the iudgement of men he shall not be blame worthy, but shall shew himselfe worthy of that honour that he is called vnto, by frequenting the Church &amp; procuring the honour and glory of God in what he can. <HI>It is therefore demanded of him,</HI> whether he be ready with hart &amp; voice to protest, sweare &amp; performe all these things? <HI>Answear.</HI> IN. do protest and promise before our Lord Iesus Christ and the blessed Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> his mother, that I will, to the vttermost of my power, obserue all these things. These being done, the Sword is blessed or consecrated by the Gardian, according to the blessing beneath pre∣scribed, if it be not otherwise consecrated before: but if it be blessed, then after that blessing or consecration, calling one of those that are to be made Knights, and causing him to kneell downe before the holy sepulchre, the Gardian putteth his hand vpon his head and saith: Thou N. be thou a faithfull, true, stout, good and braue souldiour of our Lord Iesus Christ, and of his holy sepulchre, whom we pray to vouchsafe thee his heauenly glory with his chosen Saints, <HI>Amen.</HI> Then the father Gardian giueth him a paire of gilded spurres, which he must put vpon his heeles, standing vpon the ground. Afterward he giueth the naked sword to the Knight: saying, Take thou N. the holy Sword, In the name of the Father and of the Sonne and of the holy Ghost, <HI>Amen.</HI> (making withall 3 crosses vpon the same) Vse it for thine owne defence, &amp; for the defence of the holy Church of God, to the offence and confusion of the enemies of the crosse of Christ and Christian faith, and to thy vttermost power thou shalt hurt no man wrongfully with it: which he vouchsafe to grant, who with the Father and the holy Ghost raigneth one God both now and for euer, <HI>Amen.</HI> Then the Sword is put vp into the scabberd, &amp; the Gardian girdeth the Sword about the Knight saying, Be thou N. most valiant, girded with thy Sword vpon thy thigh, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ: and obserue, that the Saints haue conquered kingdomes not by their swordes, but by faith. The Knight thus girded with the Sword ariseth, and resting vpon his knees and leaning his head vpon the holy Sepulchre, he is dub'd by the Gar∣dian, 3 times smiting the Sword vpon the shoulders of the Knight, and saying thrise these words, I ordain &amp; make thee N. a Knight of the holy Se∣pulchre, of our Lord Iesus Christ, in the name of the Father and of the Sonne and of the holy Ghost, <HI>Amen.</HI> (making as afore 3. crosses.) Then he kisseth him, and putteth vpon his necke, according to the old maner, a chaine of Gold with a crosse hanging vpon it; Lastly, the Knight kissing the Sepulcher, restoreth all these ornaments, goeth aside, and another is called, which is to be dubbed with the like ceremonies: In the meane time the Knight first made must stay in the hall of the holy Sepulchre, vntill such time as all the rest that are to be preferred to this dignity, haue obtained the same. When they are all made, then <HI>Te Deum</HI> is song by the Friars, and from thence they go to the chappell of the Minorites, or else there they stay still, as the Gardian shall please or appoint. Then these words following are spoken in the singular number, if there be but one: if there be many, in the plurall. In the singular it is said, Thou more beautifull than the sonnes of men, thou N. gird &amp;c. with thy sword vpon thy thigh, o thou most mighty. If there be many it is spoken in the plurall number. <HI>The Versicle.</HI> Lord heare &amp;c. <HI>Answear.</HI> And let my crie come vnto thee. The Lord be with you. And with thy spirit. <HI>Let vs pray.</HI> Grant vnto thy Church, most mercifull God, that being gathered together in the Holy Ghost, it may no manner of way be disturbed by the assault of the enimy. Almighty and euerlasting God, powre the grace of thy bles∣sing vpon this thy seruant (or these thy seruants) which at this instant desireth to be girded with the glorious sword, cause him, being defended by the power of thy right hand, to be continually garded with a garrison of heauenly souldiers against all aduersaries, whereby he may not be mole∣sted in this world with any tempestuous stormes of bitter wars, by Christ our Lord, &amp;c. Lastly, the Gardian and others, if they please, do embrace him. <HI>The blessing of the sword.</HI> Hee that blesseth it must hold the sword naked before him and say, Our help is in the name of the Lord &amp;c. <HI>Let vs pray.</HI> Listen, we pray thee o Lord, vnto our praiers, and vouchsafe with the right hand of thy Maiesty to blesse this sword, wherewith this thy ser∣uant desireth to be armed, to the end that he may be a defendour of the Church, of widdowes, orphanes, and of all such as serue God, against the fury of the Paganes and Infidels; and a terrour and dread to such as shall assault or go about to hurt him, assuring him of the certain effect of iust &amp; lawfull defence and offence, by Christ our Lord, <HI>Amen. Let vs pray.</HI> Blessed Lord, holy Father almighty, and eternall God, by the inuocation of thy blessed name, by the comming of thy sonne Iesus Christ our Lord, and by the gift of the holy Ghost, blesse this sword, that this thy ser∣uant, which this same day, by thy bounteous fauour, is to be girded vnto him, may ouerthrow and beat downe all thy enemies both visible and inuisible, and he getting the vpper hand may continually abide void of all danger, by Christ our Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI> The blessed Lord, my rocke, which teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to warre: my largesse and my castle, my high tower, and my deliuerer, my protectour in whom I haue put my trust, is he that subdueth my people that is vnder me. Glory be to the Father and to the Sonne &amp;c. Saue thy seruant o Lord God, which putteth his trust in thee. Be thou, o Lord, vnto him a tower of strength: from the face of his enemie. Lord heare our praier. The Lord be with you &amp;c. <HI>Let vs pray.</HI> O holy Lord, father almighty, who only dost gouerne and rightly disposest all things, who hast by thy gratious prouidence granted to man, in this world, the vse of the sword to represse the malice and audacious lewdnesse of the wicked, and to maintaine right and e∣quity; and wouldest that the order of knighthood should be instituted for the safegard and protection of thy people, who also causest it to be pro∣claimed by Saint <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> to the soulders which came vnto him into the wildernesse, that they should smite no man, but be content with their owne wages: we do humbly beseech thy gratious goodnesse, that as thou gauest to thy seruant <HI>Dauid</HI> power to ouercome <HI>Goliath,</HI> and madest <HI>Iu∣das Marcabeus</HI> to triumph ouer those fierce nations which called not vpon thy name: so also to this thy seruant N. who lately hath submitted his necke to the yoke of knighthood, grant for thy mercies sake power &amp; strength to defend faith and iustice, giue vnto him the encrease of faith, hope, and charity, and in him order all things aright that pertaine to thy feare and loue of thy holy name, to true humility, perseuerance, obedience, and patience, that he may hurt no man wrongfully with this sword or any other, &amp; that he may with it defend all things that are iust and right: and like as he now is promoted from a low and mean degree, vnto this new and honourable estate of knighthood, so he putting off the old man with all his affections, may put on the new man, that he may feare and reuerence thee aright, as he ought to do, may shunne the company of the wicked mi∣screant Infidels and may extend his charity vnto his neighbour, be truely obedient in all things to him to whom he is subiect, and do his duty vp∣rightly in all things that he shall be emploied in, by Christ our Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI> The forme of the oth which they must take before they may be admit∣ted to take this holy order of knighthood vpon them, thou maist see in the Orientall iournall written by <HI>Leonard Rauwolph,</HI> in the Dutch tongue.</P>

It seemeth also that at his coronation he chan∣geth his name, (like as the Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> vse at this day to do) and together with his crowne to take vnto him ano∣ther proper appellation: for he which in our remembrance possessed the throne and made a league of amity with the King of <HI>Portugall,</HI> was called before his coronation <HI>Atani Tingal,</HI> but after he had taken vpon him the Emperiall diademe he was named <HI>Dauid.</HI> This <HI>Prester Iohn,</HI> out of doubt, in this our age, is one of the greatest Monarches of the World, whose kingdome lying between the two Tropickes, reacheth from the Red-sea almost vnto the Ethi∣opian ocean: and that we may somewhat more precisely set downe the bounds of this Empire, (for as much as we can gather out of the surueihgs of the same, made and set forth by some learned men of our time) it hath vpon the North <HI>Egypt,</HI> (which now is vnder the command of the Turke) on the east it abutteth vpon the Red sea and <HI>Bar∣baricum sinum (Pliny</HI> calleth it <HI>Troglodyticum sinum;</HI> others <HI>Asperum mare,</HI> the rough sea; the seamen at this day vulgarly, <HI>Golfo de Melinde:</HI> on the South it is strongly by nature fensed and enclosed by <HI>Montes Lunae,</HI> the mountaines of the Moone: on the West it is confined by the kingdome of <HI>Nubia</HI> and the riuer <HI>Nilus.</HI> These bounds do seeme to containe that prouince which old writers called <HI>Ethiopia</HI> beneath <HI>Egypt,</HI> together with <HI>Troglodytis,</HI> &amp; <HI>Cinnamomifera regio,</HI> (the country where in those daies Cinnamon grew most plentifull, with part of the inner <HI>Libya.</HI> These countries now are diuided into many smaller prouinces, and are called by diuers and sundrie names, as thou maist see in the Mappe. These countrie people are at this day generally of all our moderne Historiographers called ABYSSINI, or, as themselues with the Arabians round about them, pro∣nounce the word <HI>Hhabas,</HI> and with <HI>Al,</HI> the Arabicke article or pronoune, prefixed, <HI>Alhabas,</HI> as <HI>Beniamin</HI> reporteth; and <HI>Abexim,</HI> as <HI>Garcias ab Horto</HI> affirmeth: all which wordes indeed originally are the same, and do only differ either in sound or maner of writing: for the Eastern <HI>Hheth,</HI> (a letter I meane proper to those nations, and barbarous to vs borne in <HI>Europe,</HI> the West part of the World) is diuerslly expressed by diuers, (as they do well know which know ought in the Hebrew, Arabicke, Syrian, and Ethiopicke languages) sometimes by our single <HI>h,</HI> sometime by the double <HI>hh,</HI> otherwise by <HI>ch,</HI> others do wholly omit it, as not finding any letter, in that language in which they write, that is of that nature and pow∣er, whereby they may truly expresse the same. Again the last letter of the same word which the Hebrewes and Arabians call <HI>Schin,</HI> is sometime ex∣pressed by <HI>sh,</HI> sometime by <HI>ss,</HI> or by the Spanish <HI>x,</HI> (which they sound almost like our <HI>sh</HI>) and sometimes by <HI>s</HI> or <HI>z.</HI> For thus I find the word writ∣ten often in the holy Scriptures translated into Arabicke and <HI>Habashi</HI> and <HI>Alhabassi, Psalm.</HI> 68.32. and 74.14. <HI>Item</HI> in <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.13. where <HI>Ardzi' lhabas,</HI> the land of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> is the same that <HI>Auicenna</HI> in the 283. chapter of the second tract of his second booke, calleth <HI>B'ledi'lhhabashah,</HI> the country of the Abyssines, or as our fathers named it, <HI>India Occidentalis,</HI> the West <HI>Indies;</HI> the interpetour <HI>Gerardus Cremonensis</HI> hath <HI>Terras al∣habes, Bellunensis</HI> hath <HI>Terras Indiae minoris,</HI> the countries of the Abyssines, or of the lesser <HI>India.</HI> Heere also it is worth the obseruing that this word, out of all doubt, had his originall from the Hebrew שוכ <HI>Cush,</HI> whereby they did long since call this nation and people, as it is apparant out of <HI>Gen.</HI> 10.5. and 2.13. by the iudgement of all Interpreters, Grammarians and Iewish Rabbines. For the Hebrew ו, or <HI>vaw,</HI> which indeed, and in his owne nature is the same with our <HI>w,</HI> is pronounced of some nations in some cases like the Germane <HI>v,</HI> or <HI>v</HI> consonant, as they call it, somewhat like the sound of <HI>b,</HI> altogether the same with that pronunciation of the Hebrew <HI>Beth,</HI> when it followeth a vowell, as the modern Grammarians and Iewish Rabbines do now teach. According to which custome it is not vnlikely but that this word שוכ, which the Iewes sounded <HI>Cush,</HI> some other nations might pronounce and vowell thus, שוח <HI>chauash, chabaas, habas,</HI> or <HI>Abyssi.</HI> And indeed, the Asians generally, and they themselues, as <HI>Ortelius</HI> citeth out of <HI>Iosephus,</HI> do call themselues <HI>Chusaeos,</HI> and, as he reporteth from the relation of the reuerend <HI>B. Arias Montanus Hispalensis,</HI> they are euen to this day of the Portugals still called <HI>Cussij</HI> of <HI>Cush,</HI> I make no question. The people are blacke, or of a deep tawny or blackish co∣lour: and blacke, we say in our common prouerbe, will take none other hue. Whereupon the Prophet <HI>Ieremy</HI> in the 23. verse of the 13. chapter of his prophecy saith thus: Can ישוכ <HI>Cushi,</HI> (the Abyssine or Blacka-moore) change his skinne? or the leopard his spots? For the same reason also the learned Diuines do iudge that <HI>Dauid</HI> in the title or superscription of the seuenth Psalme, by <HI>Cush</HI> did meane <HI>Saul,</HI> for that his deadly hate was such toward him, that by no good meanes that he might vse, he could make him change his mind, more than an Indian doth his skinne, as <HI>Kimchi</HI> the great Rabbine doth interpret this place. The people are by profession Christians, as appeareth by the letters of the said <HI>Dauid,</HI> written vnto Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the seuenth. Of whose manner of life, customes and religion, we haue gathered these few lines, out of the trauels of <HI>Francis Aluares,</HI> written and imprinted in the Italian tongue.</P>
<P>In these countries there are very many Monasteries and Religious houses, both of men and women: Into the Monasteries of the men, there is neither woman, nor any liuing creature of the female sex, that may enter or once looke within the gates. Their Monkes, which heere do hold their Lent for fifty daies together, do fast for the most part only with bread and water. For in these countries there is small store of fish, especially in the vpland places: for although the riuers are well stored of fish, yet they giue not their mind to fishing, because they know not how to catch them; there is none skilled in that art. In time of Lent, certaine of these Monkes do not eat any bread at all, only they liue vpon rootes and herbs: some of them for all that time do neuer go to bed, nor sleepe but as they sit in the water vp to the chinne. In their Churches they haue bels as we haue, but for the most part made of stone. Their Ministers and Priests are married. They say Masse, and do go in procession with crosses and censers like as they vse in some Churches in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Friars do weare their haire long, but their Priests do not so: neither of them weare any shoes, nor any man, neither Churchman nor Layman, may once enter within the Church dores, with shoes on his feet. They keep Sundaies and Holy-daies, vpon which they do no manner of worke. They are all circumcised, both men and women: but they are also baptised in the name of the Father and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost, yet not vntill the fortith day after their birth: they which liue not till this day, are buried vnchristened: to all those that are baptized the holy communion or Eucharist, as they call it, is at the same instant administred, powring a great deale of water into the childes mouth, that he may so much the more easily get it downe. The proper names which then are giuen them, are all of some signification. They affirme that they were conuerted vnto Christian religion by <HI>Candaces,</HI> (a Queen of this country, spoken of in the 27. verse of the 8. chapter of the Acts of the Apostles) whose proper name they thinke was <HI>Iudith.</HI> They haue a booke diuided into 8. parts, (this they call <HI>Manda</HI> and <HI>Abetilis</HI>) which they do verily beleeue was written by all the Apostles being iointly for that purpose gathered together at <HI>Hierusalem:</HI> all the contents of this booke they do most diligently and strictly obserue. The baser sort of people do without any controwlement or feare of pu∣nishment marry 2. or 3. wiues, according to their ability and as they can tell how to maintaine them: but these are excommunicated, and forbid∣den by the Cleargy to enter into the Church. Their lawes do tolerate diuorcements. The Noble-men do esteem raw beefe, serued in with fresh or hot bloud, in manner as we vse our boiled meats with pottage or stewed broth, for a great and dainty dish.</P>
<P>In all the kingdome of <HI>Prester Iohn</HI> they haue no manner of brasen or copper money, but in steed of it they vse pure gold vncoined of a certaine weight. In like manner salt, (yet not only in these prouinces, but also generall throughout all <HI>Africa</HI>) is vsed in exchange and buying and selling in stead of money. In some places small pieces of iron bright and burnished do serue that turne. But pepper amongst these people is of such great price, that whatsoeuer a man will buy, he may easily obtaine it for that merchandice. These countries haue almost all sorts of beasts and fowles; as Elephants, Lions, Tygres, Losses, (<HI>Lynces</HI> the Latines call them) Badgers, Apes and Stagges, (contrary to the opinion of the old writers, which haue generally denied that <HI>Africa</HI> doth veeld this kind of beast) but in all that six yeare which <HI>Aluares</HI> this our authour, dwelt in these countries, he writeth that he neuer saw any Beares, Conies, Linnets, Magpies, or Cuccoes. Yet <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> an African borne, in his 9. booke saith, that in <HI>Barbary</HI> there is wonderfull store of Conies.</P>
<P>The Locusts do more vex and hurt this country, than any place of the World beside, so that this plague is almost proper and peculiar to them. Such oftentimes is the number and abundance of them, that as they flie they do seeme to darken the aire and shadow the earth: they flie together in such great flockes and thicke troupes that they do vtterly spoile and consume the fruits sometime of one prouince sometime of another; wholly almost deuouring all their corn vpon the ground, eating vp the leaues and barkes of the trees, leauing their meddowes and pastures bare of grasse, so that the people do oftentimes leaue their natiue soile where they were bred and borne, and are forced, for want of victuals, to go seeke some other place to dwell in.</P>
<P>There is in these quarters a city named <HI>Cassumo,</HI> sometime the seat (as their histories do record) and place of the Queen of <HI>Saba, Maquedam,</HI> (that is, as I thinke, <HI>Antistes,</HI> a Prouost or President) they say she was called. By whom they affirme that <HI>Salomon</HI> King of <HI>Isra l,</HI> had a sonne named <HI>Meilech,</HI> (that is, <HI>The King.</HI>) In this city they are perswaded that the Queen <HI>Cand ces</HI> did afterward dwell. But it is best that the Reader that is de∣sirous of further satisfaction, to haue recourse to the same <HI>Francis Aluares,</HI> who hath very curiously described those thing which he did most dili∣gently obserue in that his Ambassage into these countries. <HI>Item Iohn Bermundes,</HI> who set foorth his Ambassage vnto the Abyssines, in the Portugall language. Let him also read a little treatise of <HI>Damianus à Goes,</HI> which he wrot out of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and <HI>Sabellicus</HI> his 10. <HI>Enneas</HI> of his 8. booke. Of the originall of <HI>Prester Iohn,</HI> and by what meanes he came out of <HI>Asia</HI> (where he was knowen to writers about 200. yeares since) and seated himselfe in <HI>Africa,</HI> read <HI>Iohn Nauarchus</HI> in his <HI>Epistol. Asiatica,</HI> and <HI>Gerard Mercator</HI> in his Vniuersall Mappe.</P>

<HEAD>BARBARY, and BILEDVLGERID.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He later writers, which haue diuided <HI>Africa</HI> into foure parts, do name this <HI>Barbary</HI> for the chiefe: and they do thus bound it; On the East toward the rising of the sun it hath the deserts of <HI>Marmarica</HI> (at this day they call it <HI>Barcha</HI>) euen as farre as that part of the mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> which now is vulgarly called <HI>Meies,</HI> which part peraduen∣ture was described by <HI>Strabo</HI> vnder the name <HI>Aspis.</HI> This mountaine (which runneth all along by the side of it from the East vnto the West, euen to the maine sea which of it is called <HI>Mare Atlanticum,</HI> the Atlanticke sea) doth bound it vpon the South. On the West it abutteth vpon the said Atlanticke sea. On the North coast the Me∣diterran sea doth beat: therefore all that whole tract of <HI>Africa</HI> which formerly conteined both the <HI>Maurita∣nies, Africa,</HI> properly so called, and <HI>Cyrene,</HI> is generally by one name called BARBARIA; all which tract, as <HI>Suidas</HI> witnesseth, was vnder the command of King <HI>Masmissa.</HI></P>
<P>This now is held for the best and most famous part of all <HI>Africa,</HI> and is diuided into foure kingdomes, or, if you like that terme better, foure prouinces: namely, <HI>Marroccho, Fesse, Telesine,</HI> and <HI>Tunete.</HI> The people generally of this whole country are of a brownish or tawny complexion. They which dwell in cities, are very ingenious in Architecture and such like Mathematicall inuentions: which a man may easily gather by their rare and artificiall workmanship shewed in their buildings. They are (if we may beleeue <HI>Iohn Leo Africanus</HI>) most singular honest men: without any deceit or couen: not only making a shew of simplicity and true dealing outwardly and in word, but also approouing the same by their actions to be so indeed and in hart. They are very stout and strong men; but especially those which dwell in the hils and moun∣taines. There is no Nation vnder Heauen that is more zealous, so that they had rather die, than to put vp any wrong or disgrace offered by their wiues. They are very couetous of wealth and as ambitiously giuen to seeke after honour and preferment, and therefore they trade and traffique almost into all quarters of the World. They which dwell in tents, that is, such as follow grasing and do liue by cattell, are very kind men, courageous, patient, curtuous, good housekeepers, and as great louers of vprightnesse, as any men in the whole world elsewhere. But seeing the state of the world is such, that there is no man altogether blessed, none but haue their faults, these also are not without their vices: for the citizens, which before we spake of, are exceeding haughty and proud, hasty and fumish, so that the least iniury or indignity that may be offered, they do, as the common saying is, engraue in marble, they will neuer forget it. The coun∣try or vplandish people are so clownish and of such rude behauiour, and that so deepely imprinted in their mindes, that they will hardly be wonne to acquaint themselues with any stranger, he shall hardly e∣uer winne their fauour. They are so plaine and simply minded, that they are easily drawne to beleeue things told them, although almost incredible. Of naturall Philosophy they are so ignorant, that they hold all things done by the naturall force and operations of Nature, to be wholy supernaturall. They are so hasty and cholericke that one shall hardly in the day time walke the streets but he shall see two or three either quarrelling or together by the eares. They neuer speake but hastily, aloud and as if they would eat one another. Thus farre of the quality and behauiour of the people, now it remaineth that we should speake somewhat of the nature of the soile and country.</P>
<P>That part of the country which is toward the Mediterran sea, is full of hils and mountaines. From these mountaines euen vnto famous <HI>Atlas,</HI> it is plaine and champion, yet heere and there rising with knols and hils. Heere are very many goodly springes, and therefore it is well watered with diuers pleasant brookes and riuers. It yeeldeth great store of Dates and Pomegranates: it is not very fertile for corne and graine: but of figges, and oliues with such like fruites it affoordeth yearely great plenty. Mount ATLAS, verie cold and barren, on all sides full of woods, and couered ouer with snow, breedeth almost all the riuers of <HI>Africke.</HI> Yet the cold heere is neuer so great and sharp that one need to desire to come to the fire to warme him. The later end of Autumne, all the Winter and a great part of the Spring haue many boisterous and bitter stormes of wind and haile: and oftentimes they are in these places much vexed and affrighted with terrible thundrings and lightning: in some places they haue great and deep snowes, &amp;c. But <HI>Iohannes Leo Africanus</HI> hath described these countries and people very curiously and at large, who will satisfie thee at the full; to whom it thou pleasest thou maiest adioine what <HI>Ludouicus Marmolius,</HI> and <HI>Fazellus</HI> in the first chapter of the sixth booke of the latter decade of his history of <HI>Sicily,</HI> haue written of this prouince. <HI>Caelius Augustinus Curio</HI> hath set out the description of the kingdome of <HI>Marocho</HI> in a seuerall treatise, to him, he that pleaseth, may adioine <HI>Diego de Turribus,</HI> who in the Spanish tongue hath written a booke of the Originall and Succession of the <HI>Xariffes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The kingdomes of FESSE and MAROCCHO.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat part of <HI>Africa,</HI> which of old was called MAVRITANIA TINGITANA, at this day comprehendeth the kingdomes of <HI>Fesse</HI> and <HI>Maroccho,</HI> which heere we present vnto thy view in this Mappe. Of the which MA∣ROCCHO, taketh the name of <HI>Maroccho</HI> (they call it <HI>Marox,</HI> the Spaniards <HI>Marwechos</HI>) the chiefe and metro∣politane citie of the same. The territories round about this city, and generally the soile and fields of the whole kingdome, as <HI>Iohn Leo Africanus</HI> writeth, are most pleasant and fertile, euery where bespread with heards of cattell, flockes of sheep and diuers sorts of deere and wild beasts: in all places are green and goodly pastures, most plentifully yeelding whatsoeuer is necessary for the maintenance of mans life, whatsoeuer may recreate the senses by pleasant smels, or please the eies with delightsome shewes. The whole kingdome is almost no∣thing else but one large champion, not much vnlike <HI>Lombardy,</HI> the Paradise of <HI>Italy.</HI> The hils that are (which are but very few) are exceeding bleake, cold, and barren, so that they will beare nothing but barly. <HI>Maroccho</HI> which we said was the chiefe city of this kingdome, is accounted one of the greatest cities of the whole world: for it is of such a won∣derfull bignesse, that in the raigne of <HI>Haly</HI> the sonne of <HI>Ioseph</HI> their king, it had more than an hundred thousand families. It hath about it 24. gates. The wall of a maruelous thicknesse, is made of a kind of white stone and chalke vnburned. There are heere such abundance of Churches, Colledges, stoues or hothouses and innes, as iustly more may not be desired. Amongst the Churches, there is none more artificially and gorgeously built, than that which standeth in the middest of the city built by the foresaid <HI>Haly.</HI> There is another beside this first, raised by <HI>Abdu'-lmumen,</HI> his successour, and enlarged by <HI>Mansor,</HI> his nephew: and lastly more richly set out with many good∣ly columnes, which he caused to be brought out of <HI>Spaine.</HI> He made a fountaine or cestern vnderneath the Church, as large and wide as the whole Church it selfe. The roofe of the Church he couered all ouer with lead. At euery corner he made spoutes, by which the raine water falling vpon the roofe might runne into the cestern vnderneath. The steeple made of a very hard kind of stone, like that of the Amphitheater of <HI>Vespasian</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> is higher than that towre of <HI>Bononia</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> The greeses or staiers, by which they go vp to the toppe of it, are euery one nine handfull thicke, but in the outside of the wall are tenne. This tower hath seuen roomes or lofts one a∣boue another. Vpon the toppe of it is set another turret or spire like a pyramis, sharpe toward the top. This hath three lofts one aboue another, into which they go vp from one to another by staires or ladders made of wood. On the toppe of this spire vpon a shaft of iron, in steed of a weather-cocke, doth stand a most goodly Moone of pure gold, with three golden globes so put vpon the iron shaft, that the greatest is lowest, the least highest of all. If any man from the toppe of the steeple shall looke downe toward the ground, the tallest man that is seemeth no bigger, than a child of a yeare old. From the toppe also of this the cape or fore-land which they call <HI>Azaphy,</HI> being an hundred and thirty miles off, may easily be descried. And although one should skarcely find a greater Church if one should trauell all the world ouer, yet the place is almost wholly desert: for none do euer vse to come hither but vpon Fridaies. Vnder the cloisters of this Church they report that there were wont to be an hundred Stationers, and as many ouer against them on the other side of the Churchyard, which daily heere kept shoppe, where as now I do not thinke that all this whole city can affoord at this time one booke-seller. Hardly the one third part of the towne is inhabited. Heere hence it is that within the wals there are many vineyeards, large gardens of palme-trees and other fruites, with goodly corne fields most fertile and well manured: for without the wals they can∣not till the ground by reason of the frequent inrodes of the theeuish Arabians. This one thing is most certaine, that this city is suddenly growne old before the time: for it is not aboue fiue hundred and six yeares, since it was first built. There is also in this city a very strong castle, which in respect of the large bignesse, the great thickenesse and compasse of the wals, the high and many towers, or lastly, the goodly and stately gates built of the richest Tiburtine marble, may iustly be accounted for a faire towne. Within this castle is a most beautifull Church with a very high steeple, vpon whose toppe is a golden moone, with three golden globes of different bignesses, all of them weighing 130. crownes. There haue been some kings of this country, who, moued with the loue and valew of the gold, haue attempted to take these globes downe and to put them into their purses, but alwaies some strange euent or misfortune or other did hin∣der their purpose and crosse their desires. So that it is now commonly amongst the people held for a very ominous thing for any man but once to offer to touch these globes with his hand. Let this be sufficient to haue spoken of this city in this place: he that desireth a larger discourse both of the city and castle, let him haue recourse vnto <HI>Leo Africanus,</HI> who in his 2. booke will satisfie him to the full. In this kingdome also is the city TARADANT, (the Moores call it <HI>Taurent</HI>) a very great and goodly city built by the ancient Africanes. It conteineth about 3000. houses or families. The people are more ciuill and curtuous than in other places heere about. Heere are many artificers of diuers and sundry occupations. The townesmen do yearely raise a great profit by keeping of a gard to defend merchants, that from hence do trauell vp higher into the country, from the assault of theeues and robbers, and to conduct and lead them the neere∣est and best way: for it is a place of great resort of strangers aswell of Christians as others. There are also other cities, as the mappe doth shew: amongst the which is MESSA, hauing a Church not farre from the sea, which they do most religiously reuerence. For there are some heere that most fondly do beleeue and affirme that the Prophet <HI>Ionas,</HI> when he was sent of God to preach vnto the Niniuites, was at this place cast vp of the fish, which before had swallowed him. The sparres of this Church and the beames are made of whale bones: for it is a common thing, for the sea to cast vp heere dead whales of maruailous bignesse. Vpon the coast also of this country is found that kind of Amber, which we call <HI>Amber-greese.</HI> Not farre from this city is TEINT, a towne where all those rich skinnes are dressed, which are commonly called <HI>Maroccho</HI> pelts. More of this kingdome thou maist read of in <HI>Leo Africanus, Marmolius,</HI> and in the Saracen history of <HI>Caelius Augustinus Curio,</HI> where he hath a seuerall treatise of this prouince. Thus farre of <HI>Maroccho:</HI> it remaineth now that we should speake likewise of <HI>Fesse.</HI></P>
<P>FESSE, like as <HI>Maroccho,</HI> is a kingdome so called of the chiefe city and metropolitane of the same. This city is situate in the hart and middest of the kingdome. It was built as they affirme about the yeare of our Lord 786. Neither is it only the head city of this king∣dome, but it is esteemed, <HI>The Metropolitane of all Barbary,</HI> and is vulgarly called, as <HI>Marmolius</HI> testifieth, <HI>The Court of all the West part of the World.</HI> Some there are which do thinke it to haue been named <HI>Fesse</HI> of a masse of gold, that heere was found when first they began to lay the foundations of the same: for <HI>fes</HI> in Arabicke signifieth an heap or masse. The greatest part of the city standeth vpon hils, only the middest of it is plaine and leuell. The riuer vpon which it is seated entreth it at two sundry places, (for the one is diuided into two parts) and being entered within the wals it spreadeth it selfe almost into infinite branches, and is by and by, in channels, troughs, and pipes conueighed almost to euery priuate house, church, colledge, inne and hospitall. Lastly, running through their vault, fewers and sinkes, it carieth with it all the ordure and soile of the city out into the maine riuer, and by that meanes keepeth it continually near and cleane. The greatest part of their houses, built of bricke and coloured stones, are very beautifull and do make a goodly shew to the be∣holder. Moreouer the open places, galleries and porches are made of a kind of party-coloured bricke or pauement, much like vnto those earthen dishes which the Italians call <HI>Maiorica.</HI> The roofe or seelings of their houses they ouerlay with gold and other most orient coloures very finely and gorgeously. The toppes of their houses on the out side are couered ouer with boord a dare made plaine, so that in the summer time they may be ouerspread with couerlets and other clothes: for heere in hot weather they vse to lie and sleepe all night. <HI>Item,</HI> for the most part euery house hath a turret seuered into many roomes and lofts, whither the women, being toiled and wea∣ry, may with-draw themselues, to recreate and refresh their mindes: for from hence they may almost see al-ouer the city.

Euery Church hath one Priest belonging to it, whose charge is to say seruice there and to read praiers. The greatest and chiefe church in this city called <HI>Carrauen,</HI> is of that greatnesse that it is said to be almost a mile and a halfe about. It hath one and thirty gates of mar∣uellous bignesse and height. The steeple of this Church, out of which the people with a very lowd and thundering voice are called to Church, (like as we do vse by the towling of a bell) is very high. Vnderneath this is a cellar or vault, where the oile, lights, lampes, mats and such other things necessarily and ordinarily vsed in the Church, are kept and laid vp. In this Church there are euery night in the yeare 900. lamps lighted at once. Moreouer, in this city there are more than an hundred Bathes: <HI>Item,</HI> two hundred innes, euery one hauing six skore chambers apeece at the least: for diuers of them haue many more. Euery inne hath a well or fountaine of water priuat to it selfe. In about foure hundred places you shall find mill-houses, euery place hauing in it fiue or six mils: so that in all you may ac∣count heere certaine thousands of mils. All occupations heere are allotted their seuerall and proper places to dwell in, euery one by it selfe, so that the best and more worshipfull trades are placed neerest the cathedrall Church. All things which are to be sold, haue their seuerall market places appointed out for them. There is also a place assigned as proper to the Merchants, which one may iustly call a lit∣tle city, enclosed round with a bricke wall. It hath about it twelue gates, ech of which hath a great iron chaine drawne before it, to keep horses and cartes out. And thus much of the West part of <HI>Fesse.</HI> For the other side which is vpon the East, although it haue many good∣ly churches, buildings, noblemens houses, and colledges, yet it hath not so many tradesmen of sundry occupations. Notwithstanding heere are about fiue hundred and twenty weauers shops, besides an hundred shops built for the whiting of thread. Heere is a goodly castle, equall in bignesse to a prettie towne, which in time past was the Kings house where he vsed to keep his court. These particulars we haue heere and there gathered out of the third book of <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> his description of <HI>Africa,</HI> where thou maist read of very many other things of this city, both pleasant and admirable. <HI>Item Iohn Marmolius</HI> hath written something of the same. Moreouer <HI>Diego Torresio,</HI> in that his booke which he sometime wrot of the Seriffs, (or Xariffs as the Spaniards vsually write it) hath done the like. Out of whom I thinke it not amisse in this place to adde this one thing worth the remembrance. There is a stone saith he, at one of the gates of this city, which hath vpon it this inscription in Arabicke letters, <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> FIZ VLEDEELENES, <HI>id est, populus gentium,</HI> or thus, <HI>Fes bleadi'lenes: Fesse</HI> is a world of men: like as they commonly speake of <HI>Norway</HI> calling it <HI>Officinam hominum,</HI> the shoppe or workehouse where men are made. Againe he alleadgeth this as a common prouerbe vulgarly spoken of this city: <HI>Quien sale dc Fez, donde ira? y qui∣en vende trigo, que comprera?</HI> as much to say in English, He that is weary of <HI>Fesse,</HI> whither will he go? and he that selleth wheat, what will he buy? answerable to that of the poet, spoken of <HI>Rome, Quid satis est, si Roma parum est?</HI> What will content thee, if all <HI>Rome</HI> be not inough? This S. <HI>Hierome,</HI> in his second Epistle vnto <HI>Geruchia</HI> a virgine, doth cite out of <HI>Ardens</HI> the Poet.</P>

<HEAD>The kingdome of CONGI.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F Congi</HI> this kingdome of <HI>Africa</HI> (which others corruptly call <HI>Manicongo;</HI> for this word properly signifieth the king of <HI>Congi,</HI> and cannot he spoken of the country alone) my good friend <HI>Philippus Pigafetta,</HI> the authour of this Mappe, wrote a booke in the Italian tongue, this other day imprinted at <HI>Rome.</HI> Which he penned from the mouth and relation of <HI>Odoardo Lopez,</HI> a Por∣tugall, who had himselfe been a long time a dweller there, and so a man very skilfull of the state and situation of this country, and an ey witnesse of that which heere is set downe, out of whom we haue drawen these few particulars: This kingdome is diuided into these six prouinces: <HI>Bamba, Sogno, Sundi, Pango, Batta</HI> and <HI>Pemba.</HI> The first of which is inhabited and possessed by a warlike and ve∣ry populous nation: so that this one by it selfe is able, if need be, to make <HI>40000.</HI> fighting men. The chiefe city of this prouince, and seat of their Kings, is <HI>Bansa,</HI> which now they call <HI>Citta de S. Saluador.</HI> All this whole prouince is very rich of siluer and other mettals, especially about the iland <HI>Loanda,</HI> where also they catch abundance of those shell fish which breed the pearles: these they do vse in this kingdome for exchange in buying and selling in steed of money: for heere there is no manner of vse of coine: neither do they much esteeme of gold or siluer. Heere is also great trafficke for slaues, so that the Portugals do yearely buy and carry from hence aboue <HI>5000.</HI> Negroes. This country doth breed great store of Elephants, which they in their language call <HI>Manzao.</HI> There is also found in these quarters a kind of wild beast, which they call <HI>Zebra,</HI> of the bignesse and fashion of a mule. But that it is not a mule, it is apparent, in that this beast is not barren, as the mule is: for this doth breed and bring forth yong, as other beasts do. The pelt or hide of it is different from those of other liuing creatures of like sort: for it is straked with strakes of three diuers colours, namely, blacke, white and yeallow or lion tawny as they call it. It is so wonderfull swift of foote and so wild that by no meanes it may be tamed or be made seruiceable for any vse of man: whereupon they commonly vse this for a prouerbe, <HI>As swift as the Zebra.</HI> There are also, as in other places, Lions, Tigers, Woolues, Hartes, Hares, Conies, Apes, Chamaeleons with diuers and sundry kindes of Serpents: beside hogges, sheep, goats, hennes and parrattes. Crocodiles, which they terme <HI>Cariman,</HI> are heere very plentifull. But horses, oxen and other beasts fit for such kind of seruices and vses for mankind, they haue none at all. Heere doth grow great store of Palme-trees. Of the leaues of this tree they make and weaue almost all kind of silke garments and apparell. For the vse of the silke-wormes, which in other places is well knowen, is heere altogether vnknowen. The maner of their posts, or maner of trauell from one place to another (for as we haue shewed before, they haue no horses) I thinke it well worth the while to set downe in this place, out of the <HI>15.</HI> booke of <HI>Maphey</HI> his Indian histories, who affirmeth that they haue no other but wooden horses; which story he thus laith downe. Vpon a rafter or beame, saith he, about nine inches thicke, and eight foot long, they spread a piece of a buffe hide of the breadth and compasse of a saddle; vpon this the traueller sitteth stradling: two men beare the bayard vpon their shoulders, and if the iourney be long, then other two do shift and ease them of their burden. The forena∣med authour <HI>Pigafetta,</HI> describeth another kind of carying of passengers from place to place, yet it is not very much different from this. Vpon the North part of this kingdome do abutte the <HI>Anzicanes,</HI> a mankind nation, a people I meane that eateth mans flesh: so that heere mans flesh is openly sold in their shambles and flesh markets, as beefe and mutton and other meat is amongst vs. That also which they report of <HI>Loanda,</HI> an iland vpon the coast of this country, I thinke it worth the noting in this place; namely, that they say it lieth so exceeding flatte and low, that it is scarcely seene aboue the water, and that it is a made ground compounded of the mudde and sand, which the riuer against which it lieth, ca∣steth out into the sea. Lastly, that if any man shall digge but two or three handfuls deepe within the ground, he shall find fresh water, very wholesome and good to drinke: and that which is most wonderfull, this same water when the sea ebbeth will he salt, but at full sea only it is fresh. How this nation was by the meanes of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in the yeare of Grace <HI>1491.</HI> conuerted vnto Christ anity, and with what successe they haue continued and gone forward, and yet still constantly do persist in the same, any man that list, may read of in the forenamed authours; <HI>Pigafetta</HI> in his second booke: <HI>Maphey,</HI> in his first booke of the history of <HI>India:</HI> and <HI>Iohn Barros</HI> in the third chapter of the third booke of his first decade of <HI>Asia.</HI> Before the entrance of the Portugals into this country, the people had no proper names; but were called by com∣mon names, such as also stones, trees, herbs, birdes, and other creatures amongst them were called by.</P>

<HEAD>THE GEOGRAPHY OF HOLY WRITERS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat which we haue promised, behold now, ye students of Diuinity and Holy writte, at length we offer to your view, namely, a Map of Sacred Geography, or of such places as are named by holy writers in the bookes of the Old and New Testaments, whether so ex∣actly as the matter requireth and thou doest looke for, I know not: but that it is done with my best ability &amp; skill (to which in any matter, and therefore in this especially, I dare not much rely.) I know and can truly protest. Yet notwithstanding, that I haue not bereaued the learned of their due commendation in doing the like; I do acknowledge and do wil∣linly confesse, we haue done what we could, seeing that we might not performe what we would. Therefore what heere we offer it is rather our will, than our wish. Two things, most kind Reader, we de∣sire thee to obserue and marke, before thou iudge and censure this our labour. First, that in the Geographicall names of places, we haue followed the translation of Septuagints: because that is but one and vniforme. The Latine translations as they are many, so also they are different, and in naming of places they vary much and dis∣sent one from another: so that that word which one doth interpret properly, another otherwise doth translate it according to the sense and meaning. Which is, that I may vse <HI>Varroes</HI> phrase, to make a noune appellatiue of a proper name: and contrariwise of proper names to make appellatiues. Examples of which thou maist see in the annotations of <HI>Emauel Sà,</HI> as also in our Geographicall Treasure. Therefore where we sticke as doubtfull, which of these different readings and writings of proper names we may take, we runne vnto the 72. interpretours as vn∣to a sure ground. It any man be desirous to know how otherwise the Latine interpretors do call these proper names, let him haue recourse to our Treasurie, and he shall without any great difficulty easily satisfie his desire. For in this he shall find all the Synonymes of places digested according to the order of the Alphabet. The other thing, gentle Reader, which I would haue thee to obserue, and necessarily ought to be done, least preiudice do go before sound iudgement; is this, the seats of all places of <HI>Palestina</HI> are not set downe in this our Mapp, but a few of those that are more famous, according to the capacity of the table: (for thou seest how straite and nar∣row it is:) what heere is wanting may be supplied out of the Tables following; two of <HI>Tileman Stella;</HI> the third in∣tituled the <HI>Peregrination of S. Paul,</HI> and the fourth intituled the <HI>Peregrination of the Patriarch Abraham.</HI> For if all these should haue been portraitured and ioined together in one and the same Mappe, it would grow too much too great: yea it would be so great and huge that it would exceed this, which heere we giue; an hundred times; and so by reason of the greatnesse, it would not only be troublesome in vse, but also vnpleasant to the eie. In the hart and middest of the plotte; where thou seest <HI>Syria,</HI> as it hath been sufficiently replenished and filled with places, so in places round about vpon the coasts on all sides, it is most empty and barren: so that it would appeare like a small iland in the vast ocean, and would soone haue growen into a great, burdensome and chargeable bignesse to no purpose or profit at all.</P>
<P>We haue vpon the side in a void place set the Mappe of the whole World, whereby the diligent student of Diuinity by conferring might easily see, what and how great a portion of the same, the holy history doth men∣tion and comprehend: and at once; iointly with the same labour to find out the situation and position of two famous places mentioned in the holy Scriptures: namely of the situation of the country <HI>Ophyr</HI> and the earthly <HI>Paradise.</HI> Of the which although many men do write many and diuers things, and the opinions of the learned be different, yet we haue also set downe our iudgement, willingly giuing leaue to the learned Reader, in his di∣scretion, to take which him pleaseth: and he may read, if he thinke good, that which in our Geographicall Trea∣surie, we haue written more at large of <HI>Ophyr.</HI> Of <HI>Paradise</HI> also there is the like controuersie and question a∣mongst the Diuines. The most men do place it in the East, others in <HI>Syria; Postellus,</HI> vnder the pole Arcticke. Some there are which do gesse it to haue been vnder the Equinoctiall line. <HI>Goropius,</HI> our countrieman, is perswa∣ded by many arguments that it was in <HI>Indoscythia,</HI> a prouince of <HI>India</HI> in the East, abutting vpon the riuer <HI>Indus.</HI> Some of the old writers did imagine it to reach as high as the sphere of the moone: others do place it in other places. <HI>Caesarius</HI> the brother of <HI>Nazianzene</HI> in his Dialogues, in what place he supposeth it to be, I cannot deuise: for he maketh <HI>Donaw</HI> one of those foure riuers; namely, that which sacred antiquity called <HI>Phison:</HI> this Saint <HI>Hie∣rome</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> do vnderstand to haue been <HI>Nilus</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> others <HI>Ganges</HI> in East <HI>India:</HI> S. <HI>Augustine</HI> against the Manicheies hath this opinion: <HI>Beatam vitam, Paradisi nomine significatam existimo:</HI> By <HI>Paradise</HI> I do thinke the blessed life to be vnderstood. Others more later, which purposedly haue written of the situation of <HI>Paradise,</HI> are <HI>Moses Bar Cepha,</HI> in the Syriacke tongue, and translated by the learned <HI>Masius; Pererius</HI> vpon <HI>Genesis; Iohn Hopkinson,</HI> an Englishman, in a peculiar treatise, where also thou maist see a Geographicall Mappe of the same. Others also haue done the like, as <HI>Beroaldus</HI> in his Chronicle; <HI>Vadianus</HI> in the description of the three quarters of the World; and <HI>Ludouicus Nugarola</HI> in his booke intituled <HI>Timotheus</HI> or <HI>Nilus &amp;c. Phison</HI> one of the riuers of <HI>Paradise,</HI> which some do expound to be <HI>Ganges,</HI> which runneth too farre toward the East; this Mappe by reason of his narrow∣nesse, cannot by any meanes containe: the situation of which thou maist see in another Mappe of ours in this our by-worke, intituled <HI>Aeui veteris Geographiae tabula,</HI> A Geographicall chart of the old World.</P>

<HEAD>PALAESTINA, OR The HOLY LAND.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>ANAAN,</HI> The most ancient name of this country was <HI>Canaan,</HI> which it tooke of <HI>Chanaan</HI> the sonne of <HI>Cham,</HI> whose posterity diuided it amongst themselues and first inhabited it. Their names were these, <HI>Sidon, Heth, Iebusy, Emory, Gergesy, Heuy, Arky, Siny, Aruady, Semary,</HI> and <HI>Hamathy,</HI> Gen. <HI>10.15.16.17.18.</HI> Euery one of these gaue his owne name to that part of the country of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which he enioied for his por∣tion and possessed, and of them mention afterward is made <HI>Gen. 13.14.15.23.24.25.27.34.36.38.49.50. Exod. 3.13.23.34. Num. 13.22.32. Deut. 1.2.3.4.7.20. Iosu. 2.3.5.7.9.10.11.12.13.15.16.17.19.24. Iudg. 1.3.10.11.18. 1. King. 7.1. Chron. 1. Iud. 5. Psalm. 105.106.134.135. Esa. 21. Ezech. 16.27.</HI> This country was called by the name of the <HI>Land of Canaan,</HI> vntill the Israëlites, hauing partly slaine and partly subdued all the posterity of <HI>Canaan,</HI> possessed the same: from which time it be∣gan to be called the <HI>Land of Israel,</HI> which name was by the Angell giuen to the Patriarke <HI>Iacob,</HI> for that he had wrestled with God; and from thence the country grew to be called by that name, <HI>Gen. 32.28.</HI> For the word <HI>Israël</HI> in the Hebrew tongue signifieth, to preuaile with God, or a mighty man preuailing against the mighty God. Heere hence were the sonnes and ofspring of <HI>Iacob</HI> named <HI>Israëlites,</HI> and the country wherein they dwelt the <HI>Land of Israël;</HI> as is apparant out of the booke of <HI>Iud.</HI> and the <HI>1.</HI> booke of the <HI>Kings.</HI> Although the whole land of <HI>Chanaan</HI> were indeed generally called <HI>Israël,</HI> yet neuerthelesse the portion or iu∣risdiction of euery Tribe, which seuerally <HI>Iosua</HI> assigned to euery one of the twelue Patriarkes, receiued a proper appellation of the chiefe of that family, as is apparant by diuers places of Holy Scripture.</P>
<P>The names of the Tribes were these, <HI>Ruben, Simeon, Iuda, Zebulon, Isaschar, Dan, Gad, Aser, Nephtali, Beniamin, Manasse, Ephraim:</HI> and so the name of euery one of the sonnes of <HI>Iacob,</HI> remained in his posterity and place of abode in the same, so that the whole land of <HI>Chanaan</HI> was diuided into twelue parts, as the holy Scripture doth testifie.</P>
<P>Then vnder <HI>Roboam,</HI> when as <HI>Israel</HI> and that kingdome was rent into two parts, the Tribes of <HI>Iuda</HI> and <HI>Beniamin,</HI> being vnited, retained the name of <HI>Iuda:</HI> and that for these reasons: First, for that of the two it was the mightiest: Secondly, by reason that out of it the Messias was to come, it was the more famous, and the name of the whole was taken from the most honourable. But the other tenne Tribes, which were commanded by the Kings of <HI>Samaria,</HI> still retained the ancient name, and were called <HI>Israël.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, the later part, after the captiuity of <HI>Babylon,</HI> was diuided into two prouinces, <HI>Samaria</HI> and <HI>Galilee. Samaria</HI> the Metropolitane or chiefe city (of which the country tooke the name) was the seat of the Kings of <HI>Israel.</HI> But <HI>Galilee</HI> was possessed and inhabited by forreners and strangers, <HI>3. King. 9.</HI> and <HI>4. King. 17.</HI> and therefore grew to be much enuied and despised of the rest of the Iewes: so that they did vse to speake all villany and reproachfull speaches of the people of this prouince. The North part of this in scorne was called <HI>Galiley of the Gentiles,</HI> and in respect of the situation, the <HI>Higher Galiley:</HI> the other part of it, toward the South, was called the <HI>Lower Galiley.</HI> Therefore after∣ward euen vnto the time of Christ and his Apostles, and so foorth, the land of <HI>Chanaan</HI> or <HI>Israel</HI> was diuided into three parts, and called by three distinct names. The Higher country toward <HI>Sidon</HI> and <HI>Tyre,</HI> they called <HI>Galiley;</HI> the Middle, <HI>Samaria;</HI> the Lower, toward the South and <HI>Arabia Petraea,</HI> was properly called <HI>Iudaea,</HI> Iewrie, as is manifest out of the second chapter of Saint <HI>Matthew,</HI> and the fourth of Saint <HI>Iohn.</HI> This later did containe onely two Tribes, <HI>Iuda</HI> and <HI>Beniamin.</HI> Although also all the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> euen as high as the mountaines of <HI>Thra∣con</HI> neere <HI>Antioch,</HI> and the country of <HI>Ammon,</HI> was called <HI>Iudaea,</HI> as is euident by the ninteenth chapter of Saint <HI>Matthew,</HI> and the tenth of Saint <HI>Marke:</HI> and therefore also <HI>Pliny</HI> mentioneth <HI>Iudaea citerior, Iewry</HI> on this side <HI>Iordan. Strabo</HI> in his sixteenth booke, and <HI>Lucane</HI> in his second booke do also call the same <HI>Iudaea:</HI> which name, as we said before, had the originall from the Tribe of <HI>Iuda. Ptolemey</HI> and others call it <HI>Palaestina,</HI> of the <HI>Palaestini,</HI> which according to the propriety of the Hebrew pronunciation in the Holy Scriptures are named <HI>Philistiim,</HI> (Phelistines) this Nation indeed both for their great command and warres made with their neighbours for certaine yeares together, were very famous. <HI>Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Polymnia</HI> and <HI>Dion</HI> in his seuen and twentieth booke, calleth that part of <HI>Syria</HI> which is next to <HI>Aegypt, Syriam Pa∣laestinam, Palaestina</HI> of <HI>Syria. Ptolemey</HI> calleth it <HI>Palaestinam Iudaeam, Palaestina</HI> of <HI>Iewrie,</HI> or <HI>Palaestinam Syriae, Palaestina</HI> of <HI>Syria:</HI> Because that <HI>Palaestina</HI> is a part of <HI>Syria,</HI> as <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> thinketh, who calleth it <HI>Syriam Iudaeae, Syria</HI> of <HI>Iudaea.</HI> Many places of this <HI>Palaestina</HI> are expressed in that his Mappe: and therefore heere they are omitted.</P>
<P><HI>OF AEGYPT.</HI> The country situate between <HI>Syene,</HI> or the <HI>Catarractae Nili,</HI> the fall or mouthes of <HI>Nilus;</HI> through the middest of which this riuer runneth, and by his yearely inundation and ouerflowing, watereth all the grounds of the same, in old time was called <HI>CHAM,</HI> of <HI>Cham</HI> the sonne of <HI>Noe,</HI> to whose lot this country fell when the world was diuided presently after the confusion at <HI>Babel; Psalm. 78. v. 51. &amp; 105. v. 23.</HI> and <HI>106. v. 22.</HI> Afterward it was called <HI>Misraim,</HI> of <HI>Misraim</HI> the sonne of <HI>Cham, Gen. 5.</HI> and <HI>10. Iosephus</HI> in the twelfth chapter of his first booke calleth it <HI>Mersin,</HI> which name doubtlesse is made of <HI>Misraim,</HI> either by contraction or short kind of speaking, depraued by custome, or fault of the writer. <HI>Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Euterpe</HI> affirmeth, that <HI>Aegypt</HI> was sometime named <HI>Thebes.</HI> Of some it was called <HI>Aëria,</HI> or <HI>Aëtia,</HI> as some copies write it. <HI>Marmolius Theuer,</HI> and <HI>Pinetus</HI> affirme that the Turkes, and country people in and about <HI>Aegypt,</HI> do now call this country <HI>Chibth, Elchibet</HI> or <HI>Elchebitz.</HI> And indeed the Arabs that turned <HI>Genesis,</HI> the first booke of <HI>Moses</HI> into Arabicke, in the <HI>45.</HI> and <HI>46.</HI> chapters, for <HI>Aegypt</HI> hath <HI>Elchibth,</HI> from whence no doubt, the Greekes and Latines fetched their <HI>Aegyptus:</HI> like as of <HI>Phrat,</HI> the Hebrew name is made <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aegypt</HI> had three speciall prouinces or shires; the Higher, which was called <HI>Thebaica,</HI> the Middle and the Lower. <HI>Thebaica</HI> and the Middleshire of <HI>Aegypt</HI> which the mountaines of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> and the vtter section or parting of the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> at <HI>Sebemytus</HI> do define, are cal∣led the <HI>Higher Egypt;</HI> through the middest of which the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> doth iointly runne in one maine channell: and is both vpon the East and West enclosed with high and steep mountaines. The other Prouince, from thence euen vnto the Aegyptian sea, is called the <HI>Lower Egypt.</HI> This alse they call <HI>Delta:</HI> for that this country or part of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which is conteined between the parting of the riuer at <HI>Sebemytus, Canopus</HI> and <HI>Pelusium,</HI> or the two mouthes of the same riuer where it falleth into the Mediterran sea, neere these townes, is in fashion three cornered, or triangular representing the forme of the Greeke Capitall letter Δ.</P>
<P>These countries by the discreet aduise of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, were diuided into ΝΟΜΟΩΣ, that is, Shires: for by <HI>Nomòs, Nomė</HI> and <HI>Nomarchía,</HI> the Greekes do vnderstand a shire and ward, ouer the which is set <HI>Nomárches,</HI> a Lieutenant or Lord-warden. <HI>Thebes</HI> com∣prehended tenne shires, and the middle prouince sixteen shires: so that in all, the Higher <HI>Egypt</HI> conteined six and twenty shires. But in the Low∣er <HI>Egypt</HI> or <HI>Delta</HI> there were onely tenne.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> is very often mentioned in the holy Scripture: and the places where it is spoken of, are very famous and memorable: <HI>Gehon,</HI> that is, as some do expound, <HI>Nilus, Gen. 2.13. Bethshemeth,</HI> the Sunnes house, <HI>Heliopolis</HI> the Greekes call it, <HI>Gen. 41.</HI> and <HI>46. Esa. 19.</HI> This also is called <HI>On, Ezech. 30. Gessen</HI> or <HI>Gosen</HI> a country or prouince of <HI>Egypt, Gen. 45.47.50. Exod. 9. Phitom, Exod. 1.</HI> a city of store situate vpon <HI>Nilus.</HI> This the Israelites were forced to build. <HI>Ramesse</HI> or <HI>Raemses, Gen. 47. Exod. 1.12.</HI> which also was built by the Israe∣lites in their bondage, when they were slaues and serued the Aegyptians. <HI>Sucoth, Exod. 12.13. Etham, Exod. 12. Piachiroth, Magdalum, Beelsephon,</HI> The red sea, <HI>Exod. 14. Migdal</HI> or <HI>Migdalum, Ierem. 44.46. Taphnis, Ierem. 2.43.44.46. Exod. 30. Phatures, Pa∣turos, Pathros, Ierem. 44. Ezech. 19.30. Tanis, Num. 13. Esa. 19. Ezech. 30. Psalm. 77.</HI> This <HI>Iosephus</HI> calleth <HI>Protanis. Alexan∣dria, Ierem. 46. Ezech. 20. Pelusium</HI> and <HI>Bubastus, Ezech. 30. Memphis,</HI> called of the Hebrews <HI>Noph</HI> and sometimes <HI>Moph,</HI> and <HI>Mig∣dol, Esa. 19. Ierem. 2.44.46. Ezech. 30.

<P><HI>OF ARABIA.</HI> This country the Hebrews call <HI>Arab,</HI> that is, a misture, hotchpotch or dwelling of diuers and sundrie Nations together in one and the same country, as is probably to be gathered out of the six and twentith chapter of the second booke of Chronicles. But there being three <HI>Arabiaes, Deserta, Felix</HI> and <HI>Petraea:</HI> we are especially in respect of the neerenesse and neighbourhood of it to <HI>Iudaea,</HI> to speake of the later in this place. <HI>ARABIA PETRAEA,</HI> tooke the name of <HI>Petra,</HI> the Metropolitane city of this prouince and place of residence of their Kings. This also was called <HI>NABAIOTH,</HI> by the Hebrews of <HI>Nabaioth</HI> the sonne of <HI>Ismaël, Esa. 60. Ezech. 27.</HI> whereupon the name and appellation of <HI>Nabataea</HI> arose amongst the old Historiographers. It sometime did belong to the Edomites and Amalechites, and was a part of their lands and country. Whereupon the Israelites by the commandement of God were constrained to passe by this country. Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> saith that <HI>Petra</HI> the city, is of the Hebrews called <HI>Iacteel,</HI> and of the Syrians <HI>Recem.</HI> This country by reason of the passage of the children of Israel through it, and the great workes and wonders of God done in it, is very famous and oft mentioned in the holy Scriptures. The places of it oft spoken of in the booke of God, are these: The Red sea, <HI>Exod. 13.14.15.23. Num. 11.14.21.33. Deut. 1.2.11. Iosu. 2.24. Psalm. 77.105.113. Act. 7.1. Cor. 10. Sur</HI> and <HI>Mara, Exod. 15. Elim, Exod. 15.16.</HI> There were twelue wels and seuenty palme trees, of which <HI>Strabo</HI> doth speake, in the sixteenth booke of his Geography. The wildernesse of <HI>Sin, Exod. 16. Arabia Petraea</HI> in many places was a vast and hor∣rible desert, as is apparant out of the first and eight chapters of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> of which there are also diuers other testimonies euery where to be obserued. <HI>Sinay, Exod. 16. Raphidim, Exod. 17.19. Horeb, Exod. 3.17.</HI> Obserue in this place, that <HI>Horeb</HI> was part of those moun∣taines which the Greekes call <HI>Mélanas,</HI> that is, the Blacke hils; which are of such a wonderfull height, that vpon the toppe of them the sunne may be descried at the fourth watch of the night, that is, about three of foure of the clocke in the morning, an houre or two before her appearance to those which dwell in the plaine. But <HI>Sinay</HI> was the East part or ridge of mount <HI>Horeb.</HI> This is proued by these places of Scripture, <HI>Exod. 33. Deut. 4.5.9.10.29. Psalm. 105. Actor. 7.</HI> In <HI>Deut. 33. Sinay</HI> is called the hill <HI>Pharan:</HI> and in <HI>Exod. 18.</HI> the <HI>Holy mount.</HI> More∣ouer there is mention made of the hill and wildernesse of <HI>Sinay</HI> almost in euery chapter throughout the whole bookes of <HI>Exodus,</HI> and <HI>Leuiticus,</HI> and in the two and thirtith chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> it is againe spoken of. The country round about it, is called the <HI>Wildernesse of Sinay, Num. 9.10.26. Amalec, Exod. 17. Num. 14.24. Deut. 25. Madian, Exod. 18. Num. 10. Act. 7.</HI> The <HI>Graues of lust,</HI> and <HI>Hase∣roth, Num. 11.12. Deut. 1. Pharan, Num. 12.20. Deut. 1.33.</HI> The <HI>Desert of Zin, Num. 13.20.26. Deut. 32.</HI> The <HI>Desert of Ca∣des</HI> and <HI>Cadesbarne, Num. 13.20.26.32.34. Deut. 1 9. Iosu. 10.15. Horma, Num. 14.21. Hor, Num. 20. Deut. 32.</HI> The <HI>Wa∣ters of strife, Num. 20.26. Oboth, Ieabarim, Zared,</HI> the <HI>Brooke, Mathana, Nahaliel, Bamoth, Num. 21. Deut. 2.</HI> Also of <HI>Zared</HI> and <HI>Seir,</HI> mention is made in <HI>Num. 24. Deut. 1.2.33. Iosu. 24. Tophel</HI> and <HI>Laban, Deut. 1. Elath, Deut. 2. Asiongaber, Deut. 2.3. Kings 22.2. Paral. 8. Beroth, Mosera, Gadgad, Iatebatha, Deut. 10.</HI> In the three and thirtith chapter of <HI>Numbers</HI> the foure and twenty mansions or places of abode where the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> in that their tedious peregrination between <HI>Aegypt</HI> and the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> pitched their tents, are recited by name. Which mansions, and encamping places of theirs, were greatly famoused with many miracles and wonderfull workes of God, which he wrought there in the sight of that peruerse and froward generation. These places were not remote one from another by equall distances, as is very probable by these places of the Old Testament, <HI>Exod. 14.15.19. Num. 10.14.33.</HI> Neither did the people of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> being led through this wildernesse vp and downe, euer crosse the first way which they had gone before: but by winding &amp; turning this way and that way, they came thrise to the Red-sea: as may easily be demonstrated out of the three and thirtieth of <HI>Numbers,</HI> the second of <HI>Deuterono∣my,</HI> and the eleuenth of <HI>Iudges.</HI> These do necessarily appertaine to the vnderstanding of the tract of that their iourney and orderly placing of those forsaid mansions and resting places.</P>
<P>Of <HI>SYRIA</HI> and <HI>PHOENICIA.</HI> Although in old time the name of <HI>SYRIA,</HI> and the bounds thereof were more large: yet that is pro∣perly called <HI>Syria</HI> which is enclosed within the mount <HI>Amanus, (Monte Negro, Postellus</HI> calleth it) a part of the riuer <HI>Euphrates, Iudaea,</HI> and the Phoenician sea. <HI>PHOENICIA</HI> a part of <HI>Syria,</HI> famous by many reasons and accidents, amongst his more notable cities had <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon:</HI> But the chiefe or Metropolitane city of <HI>COELESYRIA, (Hollow Syria</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> we may call it) lying Eastward from <HI>Iudaea,</HI> was <HI>Damascus,</HI> oft mentioned both in holy and prophane writers. Of which places we haue spoken of in <HI>Palaestina.</HI></P>
<P>Thus farre <HI>Stella</HI> the authour of this Mappe hath discoursed vpon the same. Of the old <HI>Palaestina</HI> read Saint <HI>Hierome,</HI> and that which the learned <HI>B. Arias Montanus</HI> hath written of it in his <HI>Chaleb. Iacobus Zieglerus, Wolfangus Wissenburgius</HI> and <HI>Michaêl Aitzinger,</HI> haue described the same in seuerall and peculiar treatises. <HI>Iosephus</HI> in the six and seuen bookes of the warres of the Iewes, <HI>Adam Reisner</HI> in se∣uen bookes, and <HI>Christianus Adrichomius</HI> haue described <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the chiefe city of <HI>Palaestina.</HI></P>

<HEAD>IEWRY and ISRAEL. An exposition, with an history or discourse vpon certaine places of this Mappe.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>DER</HI> or <HI>Eder,</HI> a tower. The Iewes do call a flocke or herd, <HI>Eder;</HI> although others do thinke that the word rather signifieth a defect or want: and I know not whether it do in those places signifie a floore or plot of ground, I meane that which the Latines do call <HI>Aream.</HI> In this place some write that the natiuity or birth of our Sauiour Christ was by the Angels told vnto the Shepheards. <HI>Beersabe,</HI> the well of the oth, or, the well of confirmation made by an oth: so called for that <HI>Abimelech</HI> King of <HI>Gerar,</HI> made a couenant neere this place, first with <HI>Abraham, Gen. 21.</HI> then with <HI>Isaac, Gen. 26.</HI> Againe <HI>Iacob</HI> going into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> when he came vnto this well, he was encouraged and commanded by a voice from heauen that he should boldly go downe into <HI>Aegypt</HI> and not feare. God promising him that out of his seed should come the Captaine or Leader of the Gentiles, and the Redeemer of <HI>Israel, Gen. 46.</HI> It is also called the Fountaine of fulnesse or saturity: for <HI>Agar</HI> the handmaid of <HI>Abraham,</HI> when she was with her sonne <HI>Ismaël</HI> cast out by <HI>Sara</HI> her mi∣stresse, she wandred vp and downe in this place, ready to die presently with her sonne for want of drinke: but the Angell shewed her this well, whereby she with the child drunke their fill and were satisfied, <HI>Gen. 21.</HI> Neither is that <HI>Beersabee, Gen. 22.3. King. 13.</HI> diuerse from this. <HI>BETHANIA,</HI> the house of obedience, or the house of affliction, or the house of the grace of God: where our Sa∣uiour Christ manifested his infinite power by a sufficient testimony, raising <HI>Lazarus,</HI> who had lien three daies by the wals, from death to life againe. This place is spo∣ken of in <HI>Matth. 21. Marc. 11.14. Iohn. 11.12.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BETHABARA,</HI> the house of Passing ouer, or the Ferry-house: For there the waters of <HI>Iordan</HI> were diuided into two channels, and therefore there they yeelded a safe passage to <HI>Iosua</HI> and all the children of <HI>Israel</HI> through the middest of this riuer, <HI>Iosu. 3.4.</HI> Heere <HI>Iohn</HI> baptized <HI>Christ</HI> and many others, <HI>Matth. 3.</HI> Moreo∣uer Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> speaketh of this place in the first and tenne chapters of his Gospell.</P>
<P><HI>BETHEL, Gen. 12.</HI> Thither <HI>Abraham</HI> remoued his houshold, after his departure from <HI>Sichem.</HI> For there is no doubt but that they are two diuers places. First, it was called <HI>Luza,</HI> that is, an Almond tree, or place where Almond trees did plentifully grow. There <HI>Iacob</HI> saw the Lord standing vpon a ladder, as it is re∣lated in the <HI>28.</HI> chapter of <HI>Genesis.</HI> Therefore vpon that accident the place was called by a new name, <HI>Bethel,</HI> that is, the house of God. In the same <HI>Ieroboam</HI> ere∣cted the Golden calfe, that he might seeme in that to imitate the example of the Patriarkes and holy men before him, who worshipped God in that place. Heereupon the Prophets changed the goodname <HI>Bethel,</HI> and called it <HI>Bethauen,</HI> that is, the house of wickednesse or villany. <HI>BETHSAIDA,</HI> the house of fruites, or the house of corne, prouision or hunting. Heere <HI>Philip, Andrew</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> the Apostles of Christ were borne, <HI>Iohn 1.</HI> The Euangelists also <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Marke</HI> haue made mention of this place, <HI>Matth. 2. Marc. 6. CANA</HI> the Greater, the country of <HI>Syrophoenissa,</HI> whose daughter Christ cured being possessed with a Diuell, <HI>Matth. 15. Marc. 8.</HI> of this see more beneath in <HI>Sarepta. CANA</HI> the Lesser, a towne of <HI>Galiley,</HI> in which Christ with his presence and miracle of turning water into wine, honourably graced matrimony. <HI>Cana</HI> signifieth a reed or cane. <HI>CANANAEA,</HI> it is the name of a country, so called of <HI>Chanaan</HI> the sonne of <HI>Cham. Chanaan</HI> sig∣nifieth a Merchant, and indeed the posterity of <HI>Chanaan</HI> dwelling vpon the sea coast did trade as Merchants. For <HI>Sidon</HI> the sonne of <HI>Canaan</HI> built the city <HI>Sidon.</HI> And in the tenth chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> is so described, as it is certaine that it contained all that whole tract of ground which afterward the Israelites did possesse, from <HI>Iordan</HI> euen vnto the sea, and so along as farre as <HI>Aegypt.</HI> There as yet was no distinction between the <HI>Philistiim</HI> and <HI>Canaan.</HI> For <HI>Canaan</HI> also was ancienter than <HI>Philistiim,</HI> which was not borne of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but of <HI>Misraim.</HI> Yet afterward when the power and iurisdiction of the Nation of the Philistines grew to some heigth and greatnesse, they caused the country, especially all along the sea coast, beneath <HI>Tyre</HI> Southward, to be called after their name <HI>PALESTINA.</HI> And in the <HI>13.</HI> chapter of the booke of <HI>Iosua</HI> there are reckoned vp <HI>5.</HI> cities of the Philistines, <HI>Azotus, Accaron, Ascalon, Geth</HI> and <HI>Gaza.</HI> When therefore the Canaa∣nites for that they possessed the places neere <HI>Iordan,</HI> were almost vtterly destroied, their name by a little and little began to perish and to fade away. And although also the Philistines, which greatly enlarged their bounds and territories in that countrie, which afterward was giuen to the tribes of <HI>Iuda, Beniamin, Simeon, Manas∣ses,</HI> and <HI>Isaschar,</HI> were driuen from thence, and were for the most part consumed: yet they retained, as I said, certaine strong cities vpon the sea coast beneath <HI>Tyre,</HI> and so somewhile they greatly flourish and were lords ouer others: within a while after they grew weaker and were commanded of others. In the time of <HI>Abraham</HI> the seat and court of <HI>Abimelech</HI> was at <HI>Gerar,</HI> who in the <HI>26.</HI> chapter of <HI>Gen.</HI> is named King of the Philistines. The city <HI>Gerara</HI> was situate in that country which af∣terward the tribe of <HI>Iuda</HI> did possesse, not farre from <HI>Hebron:</HI> and was indeed placed between <HI>Hebron</HI> and <HI>Gaza.</HI> It is therefore to be conceiued that the name of <HI>Cananaea, Canaan</HI> is somewhat more ancient, and comprehending more Nations, than the name of the Philistines, which neuer possessed all that tract and compasse of ground which afterward the Israelites enioyed. But notwithstanding because the Philistines had certaine great cities vpon the sea coast, the name of <HI>Palaestina</HI> was, by reason of their traffique, more famous and better knowen to the Greeke writers, than <HI>Canaan</HI> or <HI>Cananaea. Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Polymnia</HI> saith, that the Phoeni∣cians and Syrians possessing <HI>Palaestina</HI> sent <HI>300.</HI> saile of ships to <HI>Xerxes,</HI> and afterward he addeth that the whole country, euen from the skirtes of <HI>Aegypt</HI> vnto <HI>Phoe∣nicia,</HI> was called <HI>Palestina.</HI> And therefore also afterward the Greekes, as <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> vnder the name of <HI>Palaestina</HI> haue comprehended <HI>Iudaea, Samaria</HI> and <HI>Gali∣ley,</HI> when as notwithstanding the Philistines did not possesse all that large space and compasse of ground. But often times names are giuen to countries of some principall prouince of the same, that doth in power and command surpasse the rest. The Grammaticall interpretation and reason of the Etymology of the word <HI>Philistim,</HI> is thought to be, for that this nation inhabiting along the sea coast, where earthquakes are very frequent, and so whole townes and cities are couered with sand, besprink∣led and soiled with dust and dirt. For the word in the Hebrew tongue signifieth Sprinklers, or besprinklings, as when any thing is besprinkled and foiled with dust: or it signifieth otherwise Batteries and shakings, as when a building is violently shaken and mooued by an externall force, whereby it is in danger and ready to fall. Like as <HI>Ascalon</HI> and <HI>Azotus</HI> hauing their names giuen them of <HI>Esh,</HI> fire. <HI>CAPERNAVM,</HI> that is, a pleasant and delightfull village. Heere Christ first began to publish his Gospel, <HI>Matth. 4. Luc. 4.</HI> and <HI>7.</HI> For he was a citizen of that corporation, betaking himselfe to that place, when as he fled for feare of <HI>Herod,</HI> when he put <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> to death. Therefore of Christ and his Disciples they demanded there a didrachma for poll mony, as of the rest of the citizens and dwellers in this city. Of this city mention is made <HI>Matth. 8.11.17. Marc. 1.2.5.9. Luc. 4.7. Io. 2.6. DALMANVTHA,</HI> that is, the poore mens habitation. Christ with his Disciples came also into this country. <HI>Matth. 16. Marc. 8.</HI></P>
<P><HI>DAMASCVS.</HI> It is distant from <HI>Ierusalem 42.</HI> Germane miles. <HI>Breitenbach</HI> writeth that <HI>Damascus</HI> is <HI>6.</HI> daies iourney from <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> The map sheweth the situation of it to be in the mount <HI>Antilibanas.</HI> It is a very ancient city, which also at this day is very populous and much frequented by merchants. Diuers etymo∣logies and reasons of the imposition of this name, diuers men do curiously seeke; I do hold this for the likeliest, The sacke of blood: because the old opinion is, that in this place <HI>Abel</HI> was slaine by his brother <HI>Cain.</HI> Surely it is very probable and generally agreed vpon, that our first parents <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eue</HI> did first dwell not farre from this place. <HI>DECAPOLIS,</HI> the name of a prouince in the vttermost skirtes of <HI>Phoenicia</HI> and <HI>Galiley,</HI> which comprehended tenne cities: these, although those au∣thours, which write of them, do not wholly agree which they should be, it is certaine by the iudgement of all men, were neighbour cities. And it is that country which is conteined between <HI>Damascus</HI> and <HI>Sidon:</HI> and between the Lake <HI>Genesareth</HI> and <HI>Caesarea Philippi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EMMAVS,</HI> afterward it was called <HI>Nicopolis.</HI> And in my iudgement the Greek name is but an interpretation &amp; sense of the Hebrew name, which signifieth the mo∣ther of strength &amp; fortitude or victory. Others haue giuen out that the interpretation of it is, the Mother of counsell. <HI>EPHRATA,</HI> which also is otherwise called <HI>Bethá∣chem</HI> or <HI>Bethléhem,</HI> as our bookes vulgarly haue. <HI>Ephrata,</HI> signifieth abundance, fertility; a fertile soile plentifully bringing foorth all maner of fruites. For in the whole earth there was no place more fruitfull than <HI>Ephrata,</HI> that is, than <HI>Bethláchem,</HI> where <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Heauen</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> and Redeemer of all mankind, was borne: whom the Proph t <HI>Micheas,</HI> in his fift chapter, did foretell should be borne in this place. And therefore was it called <HI>Bethlachem,</HI> that is, The house of Bread. In the same place was also seated <HI>Bethhacaris, (Beth-haccarem,</HI> I thinke he meaneth) that is, the house of vineyeards. <HI>Bethlachem</HI> was the na∣tiue soile of <HI>Dauid,</HI> where he was annointed king of <HI>Israel, 1. King. 16.17. GALGAL,</HI> this word signifieth a wheele, or a wheeling and turning about, the trundling of any thing that is round. It may be that this name was giuen to that place and rose vpon this occasion, for that <HI>Iosua</HI> the captaine and generall of the Israelites, out of the camp heere and standing garrisons, did vse to draw new supplies and armies, wherewith he conquered and ouercame the enemies, and by chacing vp and down and continually vexing the nations round about, at length vtterly consumed them. Heere the royall army and campe was continually resident, vntill such time as the whole land was diuided into <HI>12.</HI> tribes, and so was quietly and freely possessed and inhabited of the Israelites. These were the first campes that the children of <HI>Israel</HI> had in <HI>Iudaea,</HI> the land of promise, and heere the Manna ceassed. For now they began to eat and liue vpon the fruites of the land.

<P><HI>GAZA, AZOTVS, ASCAION, GETH, ACCARON.</HI> The exposition of which names it thus: <HI>Gaza</HI> or <HI>Aza</HI> signifieth strength or might. <HI>Azotus</HI> or <HI>As∣dod</HI> a robbing or spoiling, or else, the fire of the beloued: or rather in my iudgement, a fortification, bulwarke, blockhouse or muniment: for so the Arabicke, a neere dia∣lect of the Hebrew tongue, doth most properly signifie. For the theme or Arabicke roote <HI>Schadada,</HI> signifieth to strengthen, fortifie, bind together or enclose with a defence, <HI>Psalm. 147.12. Gen. 12.10. Auscen. lib. 2. tractatu 2. cap. 596. Luc. 12 35.</HI> from hence is deriued <HI>Teshdid,</HI> a note or marke vsed by the Grammarians, answe∣ring vnto <HI>Dagesh forte</HI> of the Hebrew: so named of his power and force; for it doth double the letter ouer which it is put: therefore the forme of it is like vnto the Greek <HI>omega,</HI> or our double <HI>00.</HI> Againe <HI>Shadid</HI> signifieth strong, hard, stubborne: <HI>Matt. 25.24.

These were the chiefe cities of the Nation of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>listines, which was so mighty a people, that all the whole country of <HI>Iudaea</HI> or <HI>Israël,</HI> euen from <HI>Aegypt</HI> vnto <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> was after their name called <HI>PA∣LAESTINA.</HI> This their power and greatnesse continued from the first entrance of the Israelites into the Holy land, euen vnto the daies of king <HI>Hezechia, 4. Reg. 18.</HI> For all the while between these times they maintained almost continuall and cruell warres with the Israelites. <HI>GEHENNA,</HI> the vale of <HI>Hinnon;</HI> compounded of <HI>Ge</HI> which signifieth a vally, and <HI>Hinnon,</HI> the proper name of a man to whom that piece of ground did belong. It was a dale in the tribe of <HI>Beniamin,</HI> where those deuilish sacrifices were made, in which they burnt and sacrificed children to their idols. For this cruell fact it came to passe that the name afterward figuratiuely was vsed for Hell and place of the damned: and indeed the etymologie also doth somewhat fauour this sense, for <HI>Hinnon,</HI> is a spoiler, destroier, conspiratour or traitour, <HI>Ios. 15.18 Mat. 18.</HI></P>

<P><HI>GENEZARETH,</HI> a lake in <HI>Galiley,</HI> of most pure water, well stored with diuers sorts of fish.

Moreouer, both the cities neere adioining, and the lake are called <HI>Cinnereth</HI> of the forme and figure: For <HI>Cinné∣reth</HI> is the same in Hebrew that <HI>Cinnor,</HI> that is, an Harpe, a kind of musicall instrument which the Latines call <HI>Cithara,</HI> and which doubtlesse was made of the fore∣said Hebrew <HI>Cinnor.</HI> This place, diuersly written, you haue mentioned in diuers places of Holy Scripture, <HI>1. Machab. 11. Matt. 14. Marc. 6.</HI> In the <HI>6.</HI> chapter of the Gospell of S. <HI>Iohn</HI> at the first verse it is called the <HI>Sea of Galiley,</HI> for that it was situate in the <HI>Lower Galiley;</HI> or the <HI>Sea of Tiberias,</HI> of the city <HI>Tiberias,</HI> so named by flattering <HI>Herod</HI> the tetrarch, in honour of <HI>Tiberius Caesar</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>Iosephus</HI> in the <HI>18.</HI> chapter of his <HI>4.</HI> booke of the warres of the Iews, and <HI>Egesippus</HI> in the <HI>3.</HI> chapter of his <HI>2.</HI> book do witnesse, when as formerly it was named, as before is signified, <HI>Cinnereth,</HI> which, together with the lake vpon which it standeth, is not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably described by the same <HI>Egesippus</HI> in the <HI>26.</HI> chapter of his <HI>3.</HI> booke of the destruction of <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GERAR,</HI> signifieth a Peregrination Because that <HI>Abraham,</HI> going from <HI>Hebron,</HI> soiourned in <HI>Gerar,</HI> where <HI>Sara</HI> his wife was violently taken from him by <HI>A∣bimelech,</HI> the king of that place: whose striuing lust God did so pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh that he was forced to restore <HI>Abraham</HI> his wife againe before euer he had come neere vnto her, as is shewed in the <HI>20</HI> chapter of <HI>Genesis.</HI> Heere <HI>Isaac</HI> was borne, <HI>Gen. 21.</HI> to whom in this place Christ was promised, after that <HI>Agar</HI> forced by hunger, had fled from the well, vnto <HI>Abimelech</HI> king of <HI>Gerar. Gen. 26.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HAI,</HI> in <HI>Genes. 13.</HI> signifieth an heap.

<P><HI>HEBRON.</HI> Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Abraham</HI> returned out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> after his long Peregrination, seeking a new resting place, leaueth <HI>Bethel,</HI> and trauelleth vnto <HI>Hebron. Hebron,</HI> oft mentioned in diuers places of Holy Scripture had many more ancient names. Of which one was <HI>Cariath-arbe,</HI> that is, <HI>Tetrapolis,</HI> Foure cities. For antiquity diuided the principall and Metropolitane cities into foure parts: (wardes we would call them) The first was the court of the Prince, where also the Counsell, the Nobility and Princes did keep: The second, was for the souldiers and military men: The third, was reserued for the husbandmen: In the Fourth, the artificers and tradesmen dwelt. There also was the vale of <HI>Mamre,</HI> so called of an Ammonite who possessed it, <HI>Gen. 14.</HI> and made a league with <HI>Abraham.</HI> Heere three guests who went to destroy <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrhe,</HI> were interteined of <HI>Abraham.</HI> There <HI>Abraham</HI> buried <HI>Sara</HI> his wife, <HI>Gen. 23.</HI> And therefore some thinke it was cal∣led <HI>Ciriath-arbe,</HI> that is <HI>tetrapolis,</HI> the city of <HI>4</HI> great men; for that heere were buried <HI>4.</HI> Patriarkes, <HI>Adam, Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob, Gen. 25.35.49. IA∣BOC,</HI> the riuer <HI>Iaboc,</HI> that is, of emptinesse, or scattering or wrestling. The things done heere, and the histories recorded are agreeable to the etymologie and reason of the name: for heere <HI>Iacob</HI> wrestled with the Angell, and therefore he was after that named <HI>Israel,</HI> that is, a Prince of God, or preuailing with God. But the place where he wrestled, <HI>Iacob</HI> called <HI>Penuel,</HI> that is, seeing God, or the face of God.</P>
<P><HI>IERICHO.</HI> Some do expound it, his moone, others his mon'ths, or his smell. We do approue the later exposition of smelling, rather than either of the two former: and that for the pleasant and fragrant smell which partly issued from the gardens and orchyeards of the rare and soueraigne Balsam, a plant only growing in this place: and partly from the Palmetrees, which heere do grow in greater abundance, than any where else in the world beside. And therefore in the <HI>34.</HI> of <HI>Deut.</HI> it is called the <HI>City of Palme trees. IERVSALEM,</HI> that is, The vision of peace. It enclosed two mountaines, vpon the which it stood: the name of the one was <HI>Sion,</HI> vpon the which stood the castle or palace of <HI>Dauid.</HI> Now <HI>Sion</HI> signifieth a watch tower, a beacon. The name of the other was <HI>Moria,</HI> vpon which the temple of <HI>Salomon</HI> was built. For the very name also doth shew, that the fathers in old time did sacrifice in that place. And <HI>Abraham</HI> lead his sonne <HI>Isaac,</HI> to sacrifice him to the Lord, to this moun∣taine. As concerning the etymologie of <HI>mor-iah,</HI> we are contented with that deriuation of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who nameth it, God shall see. Therefore let this be receiued that <HI>mor-iah</HI> signifieth, the beholding or the demonstration of God. Yet other etymologies and deriuations, are not altogether from the purpose and to be reiected, as these, the illumination of God, or the feare of God. <HI>IORDANIS.</HI> A famous riuer running through the middest of the country, arising out of the foot of the mount <HI>Libanus.</HI> It hath two fountaines or heads, like vnto our riuer of <HI>Thames;</HI> one called by the name of <HI>Ior,</HI> which name in the Hebrew tongue signifieth a brooke: the other by the name of <HI>Dan.</HI> These meeting and running together in one channell, they are called by one name <HI>Iordan,</HI> compound of the names of the seuerall heads.</P>
<P><HI>MACHANAIM,</HI> that is, two camps, <HI>Gen. 23.</HI> These are the campes of God, as <HI>Iacob</HI> himselfe nameth this place. For as he returned out of <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> by <HI>Gilead,</HI> the Angels of God met him. Whereupon he called this place <HI>Mahanaim,</HI> the tents or camp of God, that is, the presence and gard or garrison of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>NAIM,</HI> a city so called of the pleasant situation of it, as seemeth by the etymologie of the word: for <HI>Nahim,</HI> signifieth pleasant, delightsome. Our Sauiour Christ going from <HI>Capernaum,</HI> entreth into <HI>Naim,</HI> and in the very gate and entrance of the city, he raiseth the only sonne of a widdow from death to life, and so turneth the heauinesse and mourning of the mother into ioy and gladnesse.</P>
<P><HI>SALEM,</HI> was the dwelling place of <HI>Melchisedecke. Iosephus</HI> saith, that it was that towne which afterward was named <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Neither will I oppose my selfe against this opinion receiued by so many great and learned men. But there was another <HI>Salem,</HI> which afterward was called <HI>Sichem,</HI> as is left recorded in the <HI>33.</HI> chapter of <HI>Gen.</HI> as we haue touched before. Thou seest therefore how <HI>Abraham, Loth, Melchisedecke</HI> (who was the same with <HI>Sem</HI> the sonne of <HI>Noe</HI>) dwelt not farre one from another. <HI>SAMARIA,</HI> the keeper of God. <HI>(Obserue heere that our Authour mistooke the name of a man for the name of a place: For</HI> Sama∣riah, <HI>1.</HI> Chronic. <HI>12.5. was one of</HI> Dauids <HI>friends, that went with him when he fled from the presence of</HI> Saul: <HI>or, else one of the sonnes of</HI> Harim, <HI>of the number of those that had maried strange wiues, as is manifest out of 1.</HI> Esdr <HI>10.32. when as the city was named in the Hebrew tongue, not</HI> Samaria <HI>but</HI> Shomrom) This city was the seat of the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> the Metropolitane of the tenne tribes, where their princes vsually kept their court. It was battered and laid leuell with the ground by <HI>Hyrcanus</HI> the high Priest of the Iewes. This afterward being reedified againe by <HI>Herod</HI> the sonne of <HI>Antipater,</HI> was called, for the honour of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> by a Greeke name <HI>Sebaste,</HI> that is, <HI>AVGVSTA.</HI> Heere <HI>Philip</HI> (whose consorts and fellow helpers were <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI>) first preached the Gospell <HI>Actor. 8.5. Samaria</HI> is spoken of, <HI>3. king. 18.19.</HI> and <HI>4. king. 6.7.10.17. SAREPTA,</HI> a melting house, a refining or clensing house: For the Sidonians which first inuented the maner of making of glasse, heere first erected and built their furnaces or glasse houses. In the time of that great famine which raged and was spread all ouer <HI>Iudaea, Elias</HI> by the prouidence and commandement of God was sent vnto a widdow of <HI>Sarepta,</HI> whom he together with her sonne preserued from fa∣mine and death, <HI>3. King. 18.</HI> Moreouer in the <HI>15.</HI> chapter of S. <HI>Matth.</HI> there is mention made of the Chanaanite woman that besought Christ to heale her daughter. <HI>SICHEM,</HI> or <HI>Sechem, Gen. 12.</HI> Thither <HI>Abraham</HI> went presently after he came from <HI>Charram</HI> in <HI>Mesopotamia. Sichem</HI> stood in that part of the country which afterward was allotted to the tribe of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> neere the famous mount <HI>Garizim,</HI> and not farre from whence, not many yeares after, the city <HI>Samaria</HI> was built. The word <HI>Shecem</HI> signifieth a shoulder, and the city peraduenture was so named of the situation neere the mount <HI>Garizim,</HI> But the name also of the sonne of <HI>Hemor</HI> was <HI>Shecem,</HI> of whom some thinke this place was so called. This towne is oft spoken of in the holy Scriptures. In the last chapter of <HI>Iosua</HI> it is expresly written, that the bones of <HI>Ioseph</HI> were buried in this place, as it is also in the <HI>7.</HI> chapter of the Acts of the Apostles againe recorded. The same is that <HI>Sichem</HI> which is mentioned in the <HI>11.</HI> and <HI>21.</HI> chapters of the booke of <HI>Iud.</HI> and in the <HI>12.</HI> of the <HI>3.</HI> booke of <HI>King. Ieroboam</HI> built <HI>Sichem</HI> in mount <HI>Ephraim.</HI> This same is it which in the <HI>4.</HI> chapter of the Gospell by S. <HI>Iohn</HI> is named <HI>Sychar,</HI> the last syllable being varied whether of purpose or chance, God knoweth, I cannot tell. In the time of S. <HI>Hierome</HI> it was <HI>Neapolis, Naples.</HI> This is it which in the <HI>33.</HI> of <HI>Gen.</HI> was called both <HI>Sichem</HI> and <HI>Salem.</HI> Now there was another <HI>Salem</HI> in this country, as we haue shewed before. <HI>SICLAG.</HI> In this place <HI>Dauid</HI> dwelt a yeare and <HI>4.</HI> months: whereupon it came to passe that euer after the kings of <HI>Iuda</HI> held this towne as their owne inheritance, <HI>1. Reg. 27.</HI> This city in the absence of <HI>Dauid,</HI> was sacked and fired, <HI>1. Reg. 30. SODOMA, GOMORRHA, ADAMA, SEBOIM</HI> and <HI>SEGOR</HI> were the <HI>5.</HI> cities situate in the vale of <HI>Siddim,</HI> that is, the champion vale or the vale of Salt-pits, <HI>Gen. 14.10.</HI> which by reason of the great fertility and pleasant situation of it, was com∣pared to the Paradise or garden of God, or like <HI>Aegypt</HI> the garden of the world, <HI>Gen. 13.10.</HI> In it were many slime pits, (<HI>bitumen</HI> the Latines call it) <HI>Gen. 14.10.</HI> In that same place now is <HI>Mare salsum,</HI> the salt sea, otherwise called <HI>Mare mortuum,</HI> the dead sea, or <HI>Lacus asphaltites,</HI> the lake of slime, a kind of liquid matter like pitch, that issueth out of the earth, and therefore is called <HI>Pissaphaltus:</HI> this they vse in those countries in the laying of stone or bricke, in steed of lime or mortar. <HI>Sodom</HI> as seemeth tooke the name of the champion plaine wherein it stood. <HI>Gomorrha,</HI> of an handfull or gauell of corne. In the Arabicke tongue the theme doth signifie to abide, liue, or stay in a place, <HI>Psalm. 25.13. Hebr. 7.23.</HI> To prolong life, to cause to liue long, <HI>Mahomet</HI> in the <HI>45. Azzoara,</HI> his <HI>Alkoran,</HI> and the interpretours of the Psalmes and New Testament, do often vse the word thus. And from hence <HI>Gomor,</HI> or <HI>Homor,</HI> (for so they sometime expresse the orientall letter <HI>ain</HI>) signifieth <HI>vi∣tae prolixitatem,</HI> the continuance and length of daies of a mans life. <HI>Azzoara 31.32.</HI> and <HI>36. Item Psal. 31.11</HI> and <HI>90.9.</HI> Lastly, <HI>Magburah,</HI> is the same that <HI>Thebel</HI> is in Hebrew, or <HI>Oecoumene</HI> in Greeke, that is, so much of the earth as is habitable, <HI>Psa. 33.81. Psa. 107.7.</HI> and in <HI>Auicen.</HI> very often as also in the Geo∣graphy of <HI>Nazaradin,</HI> where it is opposed to <HI>Chala,</HI> that is desert, forestie, wast, inhabitable. And so I thinke the more probable deriuation is to be fetched from the Arabicke, rather than from that of the Hebrew. For such is the situation of this place, whether you respect the wholesomnesse and kindnesse of the aire, or fertility of the soile, that before the fall it was so well inhabited, as no place better in all this land. <HI>Adama</HI> or <HI>Admah,</HI> red earth, the best kind of soile for carcable land. <HI>Zeboim</HI> a pleasant and beautifull country. <HI>Zeor</HI> or <HI>Sohar,</HI> a little prouince.</P>
<P><HI>THABOR,</HI> a mountaine in the tribe of <HI>Nephtalim</HI> neere to <HI>Chedes. Thabor</HI> signifieth purity, cleannesse, or (by the changing of <HI>Thau,</HI> into <HI>Teth,</HI> a letter of like force and instrument of pronunciation) a nauell, bullion, bosse or pommell. For it ariseth vp in the middest of the plaine, like the nauell vpon the belly. For it is <HI>30.</HI> furlongs high, and the diameter of the flatte of the toppe is almost <HI>20.</HI> furlongs ouer. <HI>TYRVS,</HI> was a colony drawne forth of <HI>Sidon.</HI> The Hebrew name is <HI>Zor,</HI> which sign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fieth a rebell, or traitour. For it is probable that a part of the citizens of <HI>Sidon</HI> falling to mutiny, departed out of the city and to haue sought where they might dwell in some other place to their better liking. This great <HI>Alexander</HI> tooke after he had besiedged it <HI>7</HI> months, putting <HI>7000.</HI> citizens to the sword &amp; hang'd vp other <HI>2000.</HI></P>
<P><HI>ZIDON,</HI> so named o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Zidon</HI> the sonne of <HI>Chanaan,</HI> as it is left recorded in the <HI>10.</HI> chap. of <HI>Gen.</HI> The word signifieth an hunting, or taking of any pray. This city being take by <HI>Ocho</HI> K. of <HI>Persia,</HI> by the treachery of the soldiers, was burnt by the straglers &amp; baser sort that followed the camp, in which fire perished about <HI>40000.</HI> men.</P>
<P>In the <HI>5.</HI> chapter of S. <HI>Marks</HI> Gospell, and the <HI>8.</HI> of S. <HI>Lukes,</HI> there is mention made of the country of the <HI>Gadarenes,</HI> in that history where Christ casteth the di∣uels out of the mad man, and the diuels rushing into the heard of swine do cary them headlong into the lake. This country S. <HI>Matthew</HI> calleth the country of the <HI>Gerge∣senes,</HI> which S. <HI>Hierome</HI> translateth <HI>Gerasers.</HI> It is therefore to be vnderstood that the town <HI>Gerasa,</HI> famoused also by <HI>Stephanus</HI> stood not vpon the South bank of <HI>Iordan,</HI> where the most fertile and pleasant plaine of <HI>Galiley</HI> is seated, but toward the desert and wast land, beyond the riuer, vpon the North banke. So that the di∣uers names of one and the same towne, are <HI>Gerasa, Gadara</HI> and <HI>Gergasa.</HI> Neither is the cleare lake of <HI>Genesareth,</HI> of which we haue spoken before, to be thought to be one and the same with the like of the <HI>Gadarens,</HI> but another situate neere the town <HI>Gadara</HI> far distant and remote from thence of which <HI>Strabo</HI> thus speaketh, <HI>The water also of the lake of</HI> Gadara <HI>is troubled and muddy, of which if any beasts do drinke, they will cast their haire, their hoofes and their hornes.</HI></P>

Ca∣pharsalama,</HI> or, as the Greeke copy hath, <HI>Capharsarama:</HI> it is now called <HI>Assur,</HI> as some learned men thinke; and was the first towne that the Christians wanne in their voiage to the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> as <HI>Volaterran</HI> writeth) <HI>v. 31.</HI> where the footmen leauing him returned to the castle, he was the next day caried on to <HI>Cesarea Palaestinae,</HI> where <HI>Felix</HI> the gouernour lay, <HI>v. 32.33.</HI> where fiue daies after, he was by him brought foorth before <HI>Ananias</HI> the high Priest, the elders of the Iewes, and other his aduersaries, there to answer to the faigned and malitious obiections of their prating lawyer <HI>Tertullus, Act. 24.1.</HI> but because beside their slanderous cauills, and bare affirmations, there were neither depositions nor witnesses present, <HI>v. 20.21.</HI> he was for that time dismissed and committed as prisoner vnto the keeping of a Centurion, <HI>v. 24.</HI> In the meane time, <HI>Felix</HI> hauing now been president full out two yeeres, and being to resigne vp his place to <HI>Porcius Festus,</HI> (to curry fauour with the Iewes) left <HI>Paul</HI> in prison, <HI>v. 28.</HI> He within three daies of his entrance goeth vp to <HI>Ierusalem, Act. 25.1.</HI> where they a fresh againe renew their suite against <HI>Paul,</HI> withall desiring <HI>Festus</HI> to send for him vp to <HI>Ierusalem, v. 3.</HI> which <HI>Festus</HI> would not grant, <HI>v. 4.</HI> but willeth them to bring his accusers and witnesse downe ta <HI>Cesarea,</HI> where they should be heard without partiality, <HI>v. 5.</HI> Therefore <HI>Festus</HI> hauing taried at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> tenne daies returneth to <HI>Cesarea,</HI> and the next day cal∣leth foorth <HI>Paul</HI> before the Iewes, <HI>v. 6.</HI> who malitiously accused him of many things which they could by no meanes proue a∣gainst him, <HI>v. 7.</HI> yet <HI>Festus</HI> desirous to please the Iewes, demandeth of <HI>Paul</HI> whether he would be willing to be tried before him of those things at <HI>Ierusalem, v. 9.</HI> Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> appealeth to <HI>Caesar, v. 11.</HI> which was allowed by <HI>Festus</HI> and the coun∣cell, <HI>v. 12.</HI> But before he could be dispatched to <HI>Rome,</HI> king <HI>Agrippa</HI> and <HI>Bernice</HI> came to <HI>Cesarea</HI> to salute <HI>Festus, v. 13.</HI> who being desirous to heare <HI>Paul, v. 22.</HI> he was brought foorth into the common hall before them, <HI>v. 23.</HI> where he maketh an apologie for himselfe, <HI>Chap. 26.</HI> Now when it was concluded that <HI>Paul</HI> should go into <HI>Italie,</HI> he was committed to <HI>Iulius</HI> a centurion of <HI>Augustus</HI> band, <HI>Chap. 27.1.</HI> and being shipped in a ship of <HI>Adramyttium,</HI> a city of <HI>Mysia</HI> or <HI>Aeolia</HI> in <HI>Na∣tolia,</HI> and setting foorth sailed along by the coast of <HI>Asia,</HI> and came the next day to <HI>Sidon, v. 2.</HI> and then hoissing saile came close by the shore of <HI>Cyprus, v. 4.</HI> from thence he crossed the sea by <HI>Cilicia</HI> and <HI>Pamphylia,</HI> and so came to <HI>Myra,</HI> a city of <HI>Lycia</HI> in <HI>Natolia,</HI> (now it is called <HI>Strumita,</HI> as <HI>Stunica</HI> writeth: the vulgar edition in stead of <HI>Myra</HI> hath <HI>Lystra,</HI> which is not a city of <HI>Lycia,</HI> but of <HI>Lycaonia,</HI> distant from the sea of <HI>Cilicia</HI> more than <HI>40.</HI> leagues) <HI>v. 5.</HI> Heere the Centurion shipped <HI>Paul</HI> and his company into a ship of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> bound for <HI>Italy, v. 6.</HI> and after many daies they came ouer against <HI>Guidus,</HI> a marine or port towne of <HI>Caria</HI> in <HI>Asia minor:</HI> from thence they passed hard by <HI>Salmone,</HI> an hauen of <HI>Crete,</HI> now called <HI>Candy,</HI> situate in the promontory <HI>Sammonium,</HI> (the sea-men at this day call it <HI>Cabo Salamo) v. 7.</HI> and so with much adoe casting about at last they came to a certaine place named <HI>The faire Hauen, (Pulcher portus,</HI> or as the vulgar hath <HI>Boni-portus, Lyra</HI> calleth it <HI>Bona Villa</HI>) neere to which was the city <HI>Lasea,</HI> (the vulgar hath <HI>Thalassa) v. 8.</HI> But be∣cause this place was not conuenient to winter in, they put out from hence, labouring to reach to <HI>Phoenice,</HI> a port town in the same iland, (of which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> also maketh mention in the last chapter of his third booke of his Geography) <HI>v. 12.</HI> But a gust or stormy wind, which the sailours call <HI>Euroclydon,</HI> (the vulgar hath <HI>Euroaquilo</HI>) arising caught the shippe, <HI>v. 14.15.</HI> and caried it vpon a little iland, called <HI>Clauda,</HI> thus <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in the <HI>17.</HI> chapter of the <HI>3.</HI> booke of his Geography writeth it (the vulgar and the Syrian interpretour of the New Testament, nameth it <HI>Cauda) v. 16.</HI> fearing that they should haue fallen vpon the Quicke-sands (<HI>Syrtes,</HI> the Syrian retaineth the Greeke word: the Grecians otherwise call these dangerous places <HI>Brachea,</HI> the Latines <HI>Breuia,</HI> shelues or flattes) <HI>v. 17.</HI> But at the last after fourteen nights of continuall storme and danger they were driuen into the Adriaticke sea, <HI>v. 27.</HI> where falling vpon the coast of the iland <HI>Melita,</HI> now called <HI>Malta, Act. 28.1.</HI> from thence, after he had lien there three months, he passed in a ship of <HI>Alexandria, v. 11.</HI> and arriued at <HI>Syracuse</HI> in <HI>Sicilia,</HI> where he staid three daies, <HI>v. 12.</HI> From whence fetching a compasse they came to <HI>Rhegium,</HI> a towne in <HI>Calabria,</HI> a prouince of <HI>Italy,</HI> it is now vulgarly called <HI>Rhezo,</HI> where they staid but one day, and then set forward againe and the second day came to <HI>Puteoli,</HI> a towne in <HI>Campiana,</HI> now called <HI>Pozolo, v. 13.</HI> where they staid seuen daies, and so from thence by <HI>Appius Market, (Forum Appij)</HI> and the three Innes or Tauernes, <HI>(Tres Tabernas)</HI> they went by land to <HI>Rome, v. 15.</HI> in the second yeare of the raigne of the Emperour <HI>Nero,</HI> where he was suffered to dwell by himselfe, committed only to a soul∣dier as his keeper, who had the charge ouer him, <HI>v. 16.</HI> who after he had remained thus two whole yeares restrained, at length being released, for a long time preacheth the Gospell in <HI>Rome</HI> and other places of <HI>Italy, v. 31.32.</HI> Some there are that thinke that after his enlargement he went also into <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and planted the Gospell amongst those Nations. Last∣ly, he was againe apprehended by <HI>Nero</HI> and at <HI>Rome</HI> put to death by him in the last yeare of his raigne, which was the <HI>70.</HI> yeare after the birth of Christ.</P>

That this place was <HI>Carrae</HI> famous for the great ouerthrow heere giuen to the Romane forces, led by <HI>Crassus</HI> against the Parthians, although there be some which are of that opinion, yet I dare not wholly yeeld vnto them, only I leaue it to the learned to determine. Hauing staid a while in this country of <HI>Mesopota∣mia,</HI> (his father being dead there, as the same <HI>Suidas</HI> reporteth) from thence he goeth with <HI>Sarai</HI> his wife, <HI>Lot</HI> his brothers sonne, and all his family and the soules or liuing creatures that he had gotten in <HI>Charran,</HI> toward the land of <HI>Chanaan, Gen. 12.5.</HI> (And if you will beleeue <HI>Nicolaus Damascenus</HI> in <HI>Iosephus,</HI> he dwelt sometime neere <HI>Damasco,</HI> where in his daies, he saith, there was to be seen a street which they vulgarly called <HI>Abrahams house.</HI>) When he came from thence into <HI>SICHEM,</HI> at the plaine of <HI>MOREH,</HI> (a place which diuers interpre∣ters diuersly interpret, some the <HI>Oke Moreh,</HI> others the <HI>Oke-groue of Moreh; Zozomene</HI> writeth that in his time it was called <HI>Terebinthus,</HI> the Tere∣binth or Turpentine tree.) <HI>Gen. 12.6.</HI> God appeared vnto him, and promised to giue to him and to his seed that land for an inheritance for euer: therefore in this place he built an altar to the Lord which heere appeared vnto him, <HI>v. 7.</HI> From thence remouing vnto a mountaine Eastward from <HI>Bethel,</HI> he pitched his tent hauing <HI>Bethel</HI> on the Westside, and <HI>Haai</HI> on the East: and there also he built an altar vnto the Lord, and calleth vpon the name of the Lord, <HI>v. 8.</HI> thence he remooueth and goeth on toward the South, <HI>v. 9.</HI> But a great famine arising in that land, and euerie day growing still more grieuous than other, he goeth downe into <HI>EGYPT,</HI> to soiourne there, <HI>v. 10.</HI> And comming thither with his wife, a very faire and beautifull woman, <HI>v. 11.</HI> whom he called by the name of his sister, <HI>v. 13. Pharao</HI> the king of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> fell in loue with her, and tooke her into his house, <HI>v. 15.</HI> and for her sake intreated <HI>Abram</HI> extraordinarily well, and bestowed great gifts vpon him, <HI>v. 16.</HI> who also was there, as <HI>Iosephus</HI> affirmeth, for his eloquence, wisedome and great experience in all things, had in great estimation amongst the Aegyptians. But when the Lord punished <HI>Pharao</HI> and all his family with many great and greeuous plagues, for <HI>Sara Abrams</HI> wiues sake, <HI>v. 17.</HI> he debated the matter with him, and examined him what his reason was, to giue out speech that she was his sister, and that he had not told him that she was his wife, <HI>v. 18.</HI> and so he restored her to her husband againe, <HI>v. 19.</HI> and gaue commandement that he, his wife and all that he had should be conueighed out of the land, <HI>v. 20.</HI> Therefore <HI>Abram</HI> goeth vp backe againe to <HI>Bethel,</HI> chapter <HI>13.3.</HI> into that place, where formerly he had built an altar and there he called vpon the name of the Lord, <HI>v. 4.</HI> After this returne <HI>Abram</HI> and <HI>Loth</HI> (who had alwaies accompanied him) grew exceeding wealthy and rich in sheep, cattell, tents, and familie, <HI>v. 5.</HI> that the land could not conteine them both, neither might they dwell together, <HI>v. 6.</HI> Besides that their heard-men sheep-heards and seruants could not agree, <HI>v. 7.</HI> Therefore they consent to diuide the land between them, <HI>v. 9.

Abraham</HI> therefore tooke <HI>Ismaël</HI> and all the males of his whole family and cut off the fore skinne of their flesh that selfe same day, as the Lord had commanded him, <HI>v. 23.</HI> And <HI>A∣braham</HI> was <HI>99.</HI> yeares old, &amp; <HI>Ismaël</HI> was <HI>13.</HI> yeares old, when they were circumcised, <HI>v. 24.25.</HI> Again the Lord appeared vnto him in the plaine of <HI>MAMBRF,</HI> as he sate in the tent dore about the heat of the day, chap. <HI>18.1.</HI> and lifting vp his eies he saw <HI>3</HI> men (in the <HI>2. v.</HI> of the <HI>12</HI> chap. of the Ep. to the <HI>Hebr.</HI> they are called Angels) which he entertained into his house, chap. <HI>18.1.2.3.</HI> and after they had dined &amp; refreshed themselues, goeth along with them toward <HI>Sodom, v. 16.</HI> In the way as they went, the Lord fore-sheweth vnto him the destruction of <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrha, v. 17.20.21.</HI> Wherefore <HI>Abraham</HI> earnestly intreateth the Lord to be mercifull vnto them, and to pardon the multitude for a few righteous mens sakes amongst them: but in vaine, for that that great and infinite num∣ber which dwelt in these <HI>5.</HI> cities and the territories round about them, could not affoord <HI>10.</HI> that truly feared God, <HI>v. 32.</HI> And being returned home againe, <HI>v. 33.</HI> early in the morning, looking toward <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha,</HI> he saw the smoke of the land ascending vp as it had been the smoke of a furnace, chap. <HI>19.28.</HI> For the Lord had caused it to raine downe from heauen vpon those cities, fire and brimstone, <HI>v. 24.</HI> Afterward <HI>Abraham</HI> went from thence Southward and dwel∣led between <HI>Cades</HI> and <HI>Sur,</HI> in the land of <HI>GERAR,</HI> chap. <HI>20.1.</HI> Now <HI>Abimelek</HI> king of that country, sent for <HI>Sarah,</HI> (whom <HI>Abraham,</HI> as before chap. <HI>12. 13.</HI> called by the name of his sister) <HI>v. 2.</HI> but being warned by God in a dreame that she was his wife, <HI>v. 3.</HI> before such time as he had come neere her, <HI>v. 4.</HI> he resto∣red her to <HI>Abraham</HI> her husband vntouched, richly endowed and with great treasure, <HI>v. 14.15.16.</HI> In this country <HI>Sarah</HI> trauelled, and bare <HI>Abraham</HI> a son in his old age, chap. <HI>21.2.</HI> (according as the Lord before had promised she should, chap. <HI>17.19.</HI>) and <HI>Abraham</HI> called his name <HI>Izaac, v. 3.</HI> and circumcised him when he was <HI>8.</HI> daies old, <HI>v. 4.</HI> Now when he was to be weaned, <HI>Abraham</HI> made a great feast, <HI>v. 8.</HI> At which feast <HI>Ismaël,</HI> whom <HI>Abraham</HI> had begotten of <HI>Hagar</HI> the bondwoman, mocked <HI>Isaac</HI> the sonne of the free woman, <HI>v. 9.</HI> wherefore by the counsell of <HI>Sara</HI> his wife both <HI>Hagar</HI> and her bastard sonne are turned out of doores, <HI>v. 14.</HI> After this <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Abimelech</HI> contended about a well of water, which <HI>Abimelechs</HI> seruants had by force taken from the seruants of <HI>Abraham, v. 25.</HI> yet the truth being sifted out they agree, and do make a couenant and league of perpetuall amity, <HI>v. 27.</HI> at a place, which of this euent was after∣ward, called <HI>B'ER-SHEBAA,</HI> that is, the well of the league or oth, <HI>v. 31.</HI> Heere <HI>Abraham</HI> planted a <HI>GROVE,</HI> where he called vpon the name of the Lord, the mighty God euerlasting, <HI>v. 33.</HI> and he dwelt as a stranger and soiourner, in these quarters, namely, in the land of the Philistines, a long season, <HI>v. 34.</HI> These things being thus performed God tempted <HI>Abraham,</HI> chap. <HI>22.1.</HI> commanding him to take <HI>Izaac</HI> his only sonne, (who was now, as <HI>Iosephus</HI> writeth, <HI>25.</HI> yeares old) by whom he had promised to giue him an innumerable issue, and to offer him vp for a sacrifice, vpon one of the mountaines in the land of <HI>MORIAH, v. 2.</HI> (this mountaine was since called <HI>Zion,</HI> vpon which <HI>Dauid</HI> afterward appointed a temple to be built, <HI>2.

<HEAD>Of the DEAD SEA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F the Dead sea, or the lake <HI>Asphaltites,</HI> because we haue described it in another forme than heeretofore it hath been vsually set forth in, I haue thought it not amisle in this place to say something, for the further satisfying of the Rea∣der: For I heere do giue it this forme which I conceiue and perswade my selfe it had in the time of <HI>Abraham,</HI> before such time, I meane, as it was burnt with fire and brimstone from heauen, by the curse and punishment of God, cau∣sed by the wickednesse of the inhabitants of the same. For we haue made it to be a valley lying between the moun∣taines, watered all along from one end to the other, by the riuer <HI>Iordan,</HI> in which then stood these fiue citities, <HI>So∣dom, Gomorrhe, Admah, Zeboim</HI> and <HI>Segor.</HI> Which place why and how afterward it was conuerted into a lake, the holy Scriptures do at large and copiously describe. <HI>Iosephus,</HI> in the 5. chapter of his 5. booke of the warres of the Iewes, thus discourseth of it: It is, saith he, a salt and barren lake, in which by reason of the great lightnesse, euen the heauiest things that are, being cast into it, do swimme vpon the toppe of the water: to sinke or go downe to the bot∣tome a man shall hardly do, although he would. Lastly, <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Emperour, who came thither of purpose to see it, commanded certaine fellowes that could not swimme, to haue their hands bound behind them and to be cast into the middest and deepest place of it; and it came to passe that all of them did flote vpon the toppe of the water, as if they had been forced vpward by the aire or spirits ari∣sing from the bottome. Moreouer the diuersity of the colours of this lake, which changeth and turneth the toppe of the water thrise in a day, and by diuers positions and falling of the sunne beames vpon it, giueth a lusture round about, is most wonderfull. In many places it speweth foorth blacke lumpes of <HI>bitumen,</HI> which do swimme aloft vpon the toppe of the lake in forme and bignesse of blacke oxen without heads. But when those that farme the lake do come, finding a lumpe so clotted together, they draw it to their shippes: and because it is tough, being full, they cannot breake them off: but as it were binding to the boate it hangeth to the knoll, vntill it be dissolued by the menstrues of women, or with vrine, <HI>this</HI> Pliny <HI>in the fifteenth chapter of the seuenth booke of his Naturall history, attributeth to a threed stained with a womans menstrues.</HI>] It is good not only for the stopping of the ioints of shippes, but is also mingled with many medicines vsuall in the cure of diseased bodies. The length of this lake is 580. furlongs, extending it selfe euen vp to <HI>Zoara</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI> The breadth of it is 150. furlongs ouer. [Diodorus Siculus <HI>maketh it but</HI> 500. <HI>furlongs in length, and three score in breadth.</HI>] The land of <HI>Sodome,</HI> sometime a most blessed and happy prouince for all kind of wealth and commodities, but now all burnt vp, being indeed, as ancient records make mention, for the wickednesse of the inhabitants consumed by fire from heauen, was not farre from this place. Lastly, as yet some remnants of that wrathfull fire, both in the foundations and plots of those fiue cities, and the ashes grow∣ing vp together with the fruites of the earth (which to see to are like vnto good wholesome fruites, but being touched they presently vanish into smoake and ashes) are to this day to be seene. Thus farre out of <HI>Iosephus. Tacitus</HI> in the fifth booke of his histories reporteth almost the same of it <HI>Verbatim,</HI> but that he affirmeth, that the heaps and lumps of <HI>bitumen</HI> after that they are drawen to the shore, and are dried partly by the heat of the sunne and partly by the vapours of the earth, are cleft and hewed out with axes. Moreouer he addeth, that this lake, in shew like the sea, but much more corrupt and stinking both in tast and smell, is pestilent and vnwholesome vnto the neighbours round about: againe, that it is neuer moued or driuen to and fro with the wind, nor suffereth any fish, or water foules to liue in it, as in other waters: yea it entertaineth no manner of liuing creatures, as <HI>Pausanias</HI> and <HI>Hegesippus,</HI> in the fourth chapter of his eighteenth booke, do write; so that, as <HI>Pliny</HI> witnesseth, buls and camels do swimme and flote aloft vpon the toppe of the water of this lake. The same things <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, but vnder the name of the lake <HI>Sirbon,</HI> very falsly: for it is another lake in this country different from this. <HI>Diodorus</HI> testifieth that the water of it is bitter and stinking: <HI>Item,</HI> that it beareth vp all things that haue breath, except those things that are massy and solide, as gold, siluer, and such like, although euen those also do heere sinke more slowly than in other lakes. See more of this in the same authour in his 2. and 19. bookes. That all vegetable things that liue not, do sinke to the bottome: and that it will beare vp no such thing except it be besmered ouer with <HI>bitumen, (alumen,</HI> some copies haue) <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> doth testifie in the 36. booke of his history. That a lamp or candle light, will swimme aloft; but being out, will sinke, <HI>Isidorus</HI> hath set down, as a truth, by the relation of others. <HI>Aristotle</HI> in the second booke of his Meteorologicks doth write, that the water of this lake doth white cloths, if one shall but shake them well, being only wette in the same. Of the fruites like vnto those which are wholesome and good to be eaten, yet in∣deed do vanish into ashes, beside the forenamed authours, <HI>Solinus, Iosephus, S. Augustine</HI> and <HI>Tertullian,</HI> do witnesse. Notwithstanding they do all affirme it of apples, not generally of all fruites. <HI>Hegesippus</HI> to these addeth clusters of grapes, in shape and fashion not in substance. <HI>Tacitus</HI> writeth that this falleth out not only to all naturall things arising out of the earth of their owne accord, but also to artificiall things made by hand and ingenious inuention of man. This then is the nature and resemblance of this place now, which was sometime as <HI>Moses</HI> testifieth, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13.10. to see to, as glorious as the garden or Paradise of God.</P>
<P>To these we thinke it not amisse to adioine the opinion of <HI>Nubiensis</HI> the Arabian, as he hath set it downe in the fifth Section of the third Climate of his Geographicall garden, imprinted in the Arabicke language, at <HI>Rome</HI> in the yeare of our Lord 1592. <HI>The place, saith he, where</HI> Lot <HI>with his family dwelt, the stinking sea and</HI> Zegor, <HI>euen vp as high as</HI> Basan <HI>and</HI> Tiberias <HI>was called the</HI> Vale, <HI>for that it was a plaine or bottome between two hils so low that all the other waters of this part of</HI> Soria <HI>do fall into it and are gathered thither.</HI> And a little beneath in the same place he addeth. <HI>All the brookes and springs do meet and stay in the lake of</HI> Zegor, <HI>otherwise called the lake</HI> of Sodom and Gomorrha, <HI>two cities where</HI> Lot <HI>and his family dwelt, which God did cause to sinke, and conuerted their place into a stinking lake, otherwise named</HI> The Dead lake, <HI>for that there is in it nothing that hath breath or life, nei∣ther fish, nor worme, or any such thing as vsually is wont to liue or keepe in standing or running waters: the water of this lake is hot and of a filthy stinking sa∣uour: yet vpon it are little boates in which they passe from place to place in these quarters, and carry their prouision. The length of this lake is</HI> 60. <HI>miles, the breadth not aboue</HI> 12. <HI>miles.</HI> Moreouer <HI>Aben Isaac,</HI> who in like maner wrote in the Arabicke tongue, a treatise of Geography (certaine frag∣ments of which I haue by me, for which I am beholding, as also for many other fauours to Master <HI>Edward Wright,</HI> that learned Mathematician, and singular louer of all maner literature) thus speaketh of this place: <HI>The sea</HI> Alzengie, <HI>saith he, is a very bad and dangerous sea: for there is no liuing creature can liue in it by reason of the vnwholesomnesse and thicknesse of his waters: which happeneth by reason that the sunne, when it commeth ouer this sea, draweth vp vnto it, by the force of his heat, the thinner and more subtill parts of the water which is in it, and so doth leaue the thicke and more grosse parts be∣hind, which by that meanes also become very hot and salt: so that no man may saile vpon this sea, nor any beast or liuing creature liue neere it.</HI> Item, <HI>the sea</HI> Sauk, <HI>as</HI> Aristotle <HI>speaketh of it, which also is in these parts, and doth reach vp as high as</HI> India <HI>and the parched</HI> Zone (<HI>so I thinke the word</HI> Mantakah, <HI>that is, a girdle or belt, which heere he vseth, doth signifie) that there is not in it any liuing creature at all, of any sort whatsoeuer: and therefore this sea is called</HI> The Dead sea, <HI>because that whensoeuer any worme or such like falleth into it, it mooueth no longer, but swimmeth vpon the toppe of the water; and when it is dead it putrifieth and then sinketh and falleth to the bottome: yet when there falleth into it any stinking and corrupt thing it sinketh immediatly and swim∣meth not vpon the water at all.</HI> Thus farre out of <HI>Aben Isaac.</HI> This sea is of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> called ASPHALTITES, the lake <HI>Ashaltites,</HI> of others <HI>Asphal∣tes,</HI> of the <HI>bitumen</HI> which it doth yeeld in great plenty; of the Iewes, MARE PALAESTINORVM, ORIENTALE, SOLITVDINIS, <HI>siue</HI> DESERTI, the <HI>Sea of Palaestina,</HI> the <HI>East Sea,</HI> the <HI>Sea of the desert</HI> or <HI>wildernesse,</HI> of the situation and position of it vnto the land of <HI>Iewry: Item,</HI> MA∣RE SALIS, the <HI>Salt-sea,</HI> of the hot and fitish saltnesse of the same, aboue other salt-waters, which the Arabian iustifieth to be true: <HI>Pausanias</HI> that ancient and famous historian of the Greekes: and <HI>Iustine</HI> the abridger of the large volume of <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> call it MARE MORTVVM, the <HI>Dead sea,</HI> of the effect: (there is saith <HI>Iustine,</HI> a lake in that country, which by reason of his greatnesse and vnmoueablenesse of his waters, is called the <HI>Dead sea,</HI> for it is neither mooued with the wind; the heauy and lumpish <HI>bitumen,</HI> which swimmeth vpon the toppe of the water all the lake o∣uer, resisting the violence of the greatest blasts: neither is it saileable, for that all things that are void of life do sinke to the bottome: neither doth it sustaine any thing that is not besmered with <HI>bitumen</HI>) to these both my Arabians do subscribe: of <HI>Galen,</HI> the Prince of Physitions, it is called LA∣CVS SODOMAEVS, the <HI>Lake of Sodome:</HI> for him <HI>Nubiensis</HI> doth stand, who neuer nameth it <HI>Bahri,</HI> a sea; but <HI>Bahira,</HI> a lake or standing poole: yet contrariwise <HI>Isaac</HI> termeth it <HI>Bahri,</HI> not <HI>Bahira,</HI> and by this name it is generally knowen to all the Europeans. <HI>Solinus</HI> calleth it TRISTEM SINVM, the <HI>Sad-bay,</HI> like as the gulfe of <HI>Milinde</HI> is of some named ASPERVM MARE, the rough or boisterous sea, like as <HI>Isaac</HI> my authour, calleth this same lake, <HI>Tzahhib,</HI> the churlish and dangerous sea. <HI>Iosephus</HI> in the tenth chapter of his first booke of the Antiquities of the Iewes, saith, that this place where now is the <HI>Dead-sea,</HI> was before named the <HI>Vale of bitumen pits. Strabo,</HI> otherwise a most excellent Geographer and curious searcher out of the truth in these discourses, falsly confoundeth this lake, as I touched before, with the <HI>Sirbon</HI> lake. Why the Arabian should call it <HI>Zengie</HI> and <HI>Sawke,</HI> I know not. This we haue heere added partly out of the Geographicall treasury of <HI>Ortelius,</HI> for the ease and bene∣fite of the Reader, least the diuersity of names might make him mistake the thing. Hauing thus finished the Mappes of HOLY write, It now remaineth that we do in like maner begin and go on forward with those of PROPHANE histories.</P>

For this our globe of the earth was not then further knowen, (a wonderfull strange thing) vntill in the daies of our fathers, in the yeare 1492. <HI>Christofer Columbus</HI> a Genoway, by the commandement of the king of <HI>Castile,</HI> first discouered that part of the West, which vnto this day had li∣en hid &amp; vnknowen. After that, the South part hitherto not heard of, togther with the East part of <HI>A∣sia,</HI> much spoken of, but neuer before this time entered, was descried by the Portugals. That part which lieth toward the North, we haue seen in this our age to haue been first found out by the English mer∣chants and nauigatours; a particular view and proofe of which, thou maist see at large, in that worthy worke of the <HI>English Nauigations,</HI> composed with great industrie, diligence and charge, by my singular good friend Master <HI>Richard Hacluyt.</HI> By him <HI>England</HI> still shall liue, and the name of braue Englishmen shall neuer die. The o∣ther countries which as yet do lie obscured within the frozen Zones and vnder both the Poles, are left for succeding ages to find out. Peraduenture, ancient writers that liued many hundred yeares since, haue named some country or some one place or other, out of this our continent; but they haue not written ought of the situation of the same, as being indeed altogether vnknowen vn∣to them. In this continent and circuite, curtuous Reader, (that thou beest not caried away with a vaine and false perswasion of the knowledge of things done in the whole world) or if you please so to call it, within the compasse of that part of the world described by the old Cosmographers, all ancient HISTORIOGRAPHY, both SACRED and PROPHANE, is comprehended: in these all famous acts of mortall men, which from the beginning of the world euen vnto the daies of our fathers, haue been registred by learned men, haue been done and performed. For euery storie, before the forenamed <HI>Columbus,</HI> written in Latine, Greeke or any other language, exceeded not the limits of the Roman Empire, or the conquests of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, (if you shall only except the tra∣uels of <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> by land, into <HI>China:</HI> and the nauigation of <HI>Katherino Zeni,</HI> by the ocean sea, into the North parts, of which we haue spoken in the discourse to the Mappe of <HI>Mare del zur</HI>) which I make no doubt all learned historians and others will easily grant me. Whereupon we may see how maimed and vnperfect the history of the world is, when as it is very apparant that this part of the earth then knowen, is scarse the one quarter of the whole globe of the world that is now discouered to vs. And (which is especially to be considered, rather than to be commended) we may truly say that now, which <HI>Cicero</HI> in his third oration against <HI>Verres</HI> wrote then most falsly: when he said of that age; <HI>There is now no place within the vast ocean, none so far remote and distant from vs, none so obscure or hidden, whither, in these our daies, the couetous and bad minds of our men, doth not cause them go.</HI></P>

<ITEM>I haue described a Charte of the <HI>VVORLD,</HI> in <HI>12.</HI> sheets of parch∣ment. Thus <HI>Dominicanus,</HI> the authour of the Annals of the city <HI>Celmar</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> who wrote about the yeare of Christ <HI>1265.</HI> speaketh of himselfe in that his worke.</ITEM>

<HEAD>The ROMANE WORLD, OR The ROMANE EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Mmianus Marcellinus</HI> thus writeth in his foureteenth booke: At such time as triumphant <HI>Rome</HI> (which shall flourish as long as men do liue vpon the earth) began first to grow into credit and honour in the world, that it might still rise by degrees and lofty steppes into a firme league of eternall peace, vertue and fortune (which often times iarre) did fully consent and agree. For if either of them had opposed themselues, it surely had neuer come to that absolute height and greatnesse. The people of this city from the first infancy euen vnto the last of childhood, which was limi∣ted almost within the compasse of three hundred yeares, abode the bitter assaults and warres of their neighbours round about them: then hauing growen to a striplings age and past the rodde, after many outragious furies of <HI>Mars,</HI> it passed the Alpes and narrow sea. Being come to mans estate and best yeares, from all quarters of the wide world, it brought away the laurell the signe of conquest and triumph: but now being old and beginning to dote, and sometime only bearing the name of conquerour rather than winning ought indeed, it hath betaken it selfe to a more quiet kind of life. Therefore this city, reuerend for so many glorious conquests of stout and fierce nations, and for so many good and wholesome lawes which it hath enacted, hath now at last, like a kind and thrifty father, both wise and wealthy, committed her patrimo∣ny and possessions to the Emperours, as vnto her naturall sonnes, to be ruled and gouerned. And lately, although the tribes and wardes be idle, the hundreds and wapentakes still and qui∣et, and there be no dissensions in the Senate house, but that the more secure and calmer times, such as <HI>Numa Pompilius</HI> liued in, were come againe: yet in all parts of the world wheresoeuer, it is regarded as a Mistresse and Queen, in all places the reuerend gray haires of the graue Sena∣tours, euery where the very name of the Roman Nation is greatly esteemed and honourable. Thus farre <HI>Ammianus.</HI> Moreouer this you shall find in <HI>Sulpiciaes</HI> Satyricke poeme; Two things there are which raised great <HI>Rome</HI> to that height, valour in warre and wisdome in peace. As this Romane Empire, in the iudgement of all men, was esteemed very great and large, so also in∣deed it was; especially if you shall compare it with those which haue been in former ages, as that of the Assyrians, Persians and Grecians: <HI>Item,</HI> with those which since their fall haue sprong vp in their places, as namely, that of the <HI>Othomans,</HI> amongst the Turkes: the <HI>Sophies,</HI> amongst the Persians: of the great <HI>Cham,</HI> ouer the Tartars in <HI>Asia:</HI> and of <HI>Prester Iohn,</HI> as we call him, o∣uer the Aethiopians or Abyssines in <HI>Africa.</HI> But if you shall compare it with that Monarchy which <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> within the memorie of our fathers, established in di∣uers parts of the world, and <HI>Philip</HI> his sonne in our age hath enlarged, and shall by looking in∣to an vniuersall mappe of the Earthly globe, conferre and measure the greatnesse of this with those others, by the eie you shall plainly and truly discerne, that this for largenesse may not only be preferred farre before all those other forenamed, but also euen before that of the Ro∣manes. The kingdome of the Portugals, after that by diuers nauigations they had subdued vnder their obedience the marine tracts and sea coasts of East <HI>India,</HI> together with the ilands there about, if it did reach and were extended vp as farre within the land, as it commandeth a∣bout the shore, it might doubtlesse be accounted none of the least Empires. Seeing now there∣fore that this also at this day is vnder the obedience of the said K. <HI>Philip,</HI> who doth not see that this Empire is the greatest that euer was in the world?</P>
<P>Of the Empire of <HI>Rome,</HI> as it stood in his daies, <HI>Tertullian</HI> in his booke <HI>De Pallio,</HI> speaketh thus honourably: <HI>Reuera Orbis cultissimum huius Imperij rus est;</HI> that is, In very deed the whole world is nothing else but a farme well stocked and stored, belonging to this Empire. Lastly, <HI>Ouid,</HI> in his second booke <HI>De Fastis,</HI> thus writeth of it: <HI>Gentibus est aliis tellus data limite certo, Romanae spacium est vrbis &amp; Orbis idem.</HI> All other nations, in the Earth their certaine bounds may name; The com∣passe of the World and <HI>Rome,</HI> they only are the same.</P>

<HEAD>EVROPE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the diuision of the world, diuers haue placed <HI>Africa</HI> in the third part: some few haue made no more but <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Eu¦rope</HI> only; and <HI>Africa</HI> they make a part of <HI>Europe,</HI> saith <HI>Salustius.</HI> This is that which S. <HI>Paulinus</HI> in <HI>Antonius,</HI> out o the opinion of the same <HI>Salust,</HI> thus writeth of: <HI>Europam Asiamquè duo vel maxima terrae Membra, quibus Lybiam dubiè Sallustius addit, Europae admixtam: postit quum tertia dici: Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> vast, the Earthly globe between them share. Yet whether <HI>Africke</HI> should a part of this our <HI>Europe</HI> be; or make a third part by it selfe, <HI>Salust</HI> doth doubt I see. But <HI>Philostratus</HI> also in <HI>Isocrates</HI> doth diuide the world into <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe:</HI> yea <HI>Isocrates</HI> himselfe, in his <HI>Pane∣gyricos.</HI> Moreouer in <HI>Varroes</HI> booke <HI>De lingua Latina</HI> these words are read; As all the world is diuided into <HI>Heauen</HI> and <HI>Earth:</HI> so <HI>Heauen</HI> is seuered into his quarters: and the <HI>Earth</HI> into <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> Againe the same authour in his booke of Husbandrie writeth thus: First, when as the world, by <HI>Eratosthenes,</HI> was very fuly and naturally diuided into two parts, the one toward the South, [<HI>Asia</HI> doubtlesse he meaneth] the other in the North [<HI>Europe</HI> we call it.] S. <HI>Augu∣stine</HI> in his <HI>16.</HI> booke <HI>De Ciuitate Dei: Lucane</HI> in his <HI>9.</HI> booke: and <HI>Orosius</HI> in the first booke of his history, haue the like wordes to the same sense. Notwithstanding custome since hath preuailed with all Historiographers and Cosmographers which haue written either in Latine or Greeke, iointly to diuide the globe of the earth into these three parts: <HI>Asia, Africke</HI> and <HI>Europe:</HI> the last of which we haue taken vpon vs to describe in this place, not only in forme of a mappe or chart, like a Geographer: but in this present discourse, like an historian. Concerning the forme of it therefore, it is manifold, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth. It is a <HI>Peninsula</HI> or demy-ile, and not an iland; although <HI>Silenus,</HI> as <HI>Elianus</HI> writeth, did sometime to <HI>Midas</HI> so relate of it. For it is on all sides, as you may see in the mappe, bounded and beaten with the salt sea, but only vpon the East, where it is by a small necke ioined to the greater <HI>Asia.</HI> Yet by what limits they are there distinguished, the ancient and the later writers do not altogether agree. For those which are more ancient as <HI>Aristotle, Plato, Herodotus,</HI> and others which do follow their opinion, do diuide <HI>Europe</HI> from <HI>Asia,</HI> by the riuer <HI>Phasis,</HI> (a riuer of <HI>Colchis</HI> falling into the Euxine sea, <HI>Mar maiore,</HI> or <HI>Maurothalassa,</HI> as the Greeks call it) neere <HI>Trapezonda:</HI> some mappes do now call that riuer <HI>Fasso,</HI> others <HI>Phaz∣zeth:</HI> the Scythians, (as <HI>Theuet</HI> reporteth, <HI>Debbassethca</HI>) or which is all one, by that <HI>Isthmos</HI> or neckland which is between the foresaid <HI>Mar maiore</HI> or <HI>Pontus Euxinus,</HI> and the Caspian sea (<HI>Mar de Cachu,</HI> the ancient called it <HI>Mare Hyrcanum,</HI> the Hyrcane sea) which formerly all old writers thought to be but a bay or gulfe of the Scythian or Northren ocean, as <HI>Strabo, Pliny, Mela, Dionysius, Plutarch</HI> (in the life of <HI>Alexander</HI> and in his discourse of the face in the sphere of the Moone) and <HI>Iornandes</HI> a more late writer, haue left recorded. Yet all of them were deceiued. Only <HI>Herodotus</HI> truly (as this our latter age doth approue and find to be so) doth affirme this to be a sea of it selfe, and to haue neither in-let nor out-let, or to be intermedled with any other sea. <HI>Dionysius, Arrianus, Diodorus, Polybius, Iornandes</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey</HI> haue diuided it from <HI>Asia</HI> by the riuer <HI>Tanais (Don</HI> or <HI>Tana,</HI> as now the Italians name it) who thinketh that both the rise of this riuer, and the land Northward from whence it commeth, are both vnknowen and vncertaine. All doubt where to place and lay their bounds: as indeed who neuer perfectly knew those places toward the East and North, not being then discouered, but only described by them, from the fabulous reports of others: as for example, the <HI>Riphaean</HI> and <HI>Hyperboraean</HI> mountaines, which are feined inuentions of the Greekes, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth: together with <HI>Aluani montes,</HI> heere described by <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> where now not only these mountaines, but also no other at this day, are to be seene: but in their places diuers huge and vast woods, great fennes and bogges, or large champion plaines. <HI>Orpheus</HI> also long since described in this part of the continent I meane, between <HI>Maeotis palus,</HI> the fenne <HI>Maeotis,</HI> (now called <HI>Mar delle Zabacche,</HI> and <HI>Mar della Tana</HI>) and the sea <HI>Cronium,</HI> an huge wood. Likewise, <HI>Dionysius Afer</HI> heere abouts placeth an <HI>Infinite wood,</HI> as he termeth it, from whence he saith <HI>Tanais</HI> or <HI>Don</HI> doth spring, which after many windings and turnings at last falleth into the forenamed fenne <HI>Maeotis. Isidorus</HI> heere hath the <HI>Riphaean woods,</HI> in which he saith <HI>Tanais</HI> doth first take the beginning. That <HI>Donaw (Danubius)</HI> doth diuide <HI>Asia</HI> from <HI>Europe, Seneca</HI> in the sixth booke <HI>Natural.</HI> doth manifestly affirme; of which his opinion, what we do thinke, we will, God willing, set downe in the discourse to the Mappe of <HI>Dacia.</HI> Hitherto we see the forenamed au∣thours to doubt and disagree between themselues of the limittes of these two parts of the world: If therefore they shall find me a meet vmpier and arbitratour in this matter, I would, not vnfitly, and as I hope to the liking of all parties, decide the controuersie thus: I would make the bounds, to be <HI>Tanais,</HI> or the ri∣uer <HI>Don;</HI> the straights or narrow peece of the maine land that is between this riuer and the riuer <HI>Rha, (Athel)</HI> which emptieth it selfe into the Caspian sea: the East branch of the same <HI>Athel:</HI> then from his head vnto the riuer <HI>Oby,</HI> and so euen vnto his mouth or fall into the Northren sea: For by this mouth, I do easily perswade my selfe, that antiquity did verily beleeue that the Caspian sea did vnlade it selfe into the maine Ocean. For that the name of this riuer <HI>O∣by</HI> is ancient, it is very likely, for that <HI>montes Obij,</HI> certaine mountaines called <HI>Obij</HI> are placed heereabout in this tract, by <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> which he saith for∣merly were called of the ancients <HI>montes Riphaei,</HI> the Riphaean hils: but then in his daies <HI>montes Alpes,</HI> the Alpes. Againe <HI>Iornandes</HI> in this continent, not farre from hence, describeth <HI>Ouim,</HI> or <HI>Obim,</HI> a Scythian nation or family. And that these foresaid mountaines, are in this place (not where <HI>Ptolemey</HI> and <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> haue placed them) very many men, of great credit and learning in these our daies, sufficient witnesses do stoutly auouch. Amongst which <HI>Baro Herberstein,</HI> in his history of <HI>Moscouy,</HI> is one: <HI>Paul Oderborne,</HI> in his treatise written of the life of <HI>Basilides,</HI> is another: lastly, <HI>Antony Wied,</HI> in his mappe of <HI>Moscouy</HI> may be the third. Now they name it vulgarly by diuers and sundrie names, but commonly they call it <HI>Cingulum mundi,</HI> The girdle of the world, as the said <HI>Herberstein</HI> doth affirme. In a Mappe of these countries set out by Master <HI>Ienkinson,</HI> an Englishman, who trauelled through these parts, it is called <HI>Zona Orbis,</HI> The girdle of the Earth. Moreouer I haue in some sort for this diuision, <HI>Iornandes</HI> and <HI>Aethicus,</HI> vpon my side, where they say that the Riphaean mountaines do part <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> Againe these selfe same hils, yea, and in this tract, are the <HI>montes Hyperbo∣rei;</HI> not where <HI>Ptolemey</HI> placeth them. And they are the same with <HI>montes Riphaei, Obij</HI> and <HI>Alpes.</HI> Thus farre of the diuision of <HI>Asia</HI> from <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> calleth this part of the world, <HI>The Nurce of all Nations; Mardonius,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> doth tell of him, auoucheth it to <HI>Xerxes, To be by farre the beautifullest of all places of the World, to be a most goodly and gallant country, yeelding all maner of fruites and fruitfull trees, and those in their kindes the best; and to be such that it were pity that any king in the World should haue ought to do in but he. Varro</HI> in his bookes <HI>De re Rustica,</HI> of Husbandrie writeth, <HI>That it is a more temperate and healthfull soile than</HI> Asia. <HI>Statius</HI> in his <HI>Achilleidos,</HI> more than once or twice calleth it, <HI>The Mighty prouince of the World. Maxima terra viris &amp; foecundissima doctis Vrbibus, Europe</HI> for multitude of warlike men and scholers deeply learned, doth farre excell —: thus <HI>Mamilius</HI> writeth of it. <HI>Aristotle,</HI> the prince of Philosophers, maketh the inhabiters of this part of the world, to be, <HI>A very stout and couragious people.</HI> The same authour affirmeth, that, <HI>All kind of beasts and cattell heere, are in their kind, greater and stronger than in</HI> Asia <HI>and</HI> Africke. But of the nature of this country, the maners and customes of the people, let vs heare what <HI>Strabo</HI> that excellent Geographer saith in his second booke; <HI>This part is most fertile of valiant and prudent men. It is all generally habitable, excepting only a very small portion toward the North, and abutting vpon the</HI> Hamaxici, <HI>which dwell vpon</HI> Tanais, (Don) Maeotis palus (Mar delle Zabacche) <HI>and</HI> Borysthenes (Nieper <HI>or</HI> Dnester) <HI>which place, by reason of the extream cold, is not habitable. Yet certaine bleake and mountainous places inhabited, although in re∣spect of the nature of the soile they are tilled and manured with greater difficulty, yet hauing gotten good skilfull and industrious husbands, those also are tamed and much bettered, which heeretofore were badly vsed, and kept only by theeues and out-lawes. And indeed the Greekes when they dwelt vpon the rocks and mountaines, dwelt well and conueniently, by reason of their wise cariage in ciuill matters, arts, sciences and knowledge of those things, which necessarily are required to the maintenance of mans life. In like maner the Romanes, hauing brought many sauage and fierce Nations vnder their seruile yoke, seated, I meane, in places not very conuenient to dwell in, in respect of the nature of the coun∣try, either for that it was rough and craggy, or wanted hauens, or was too bleake and cold, or for other causes, taught them to vse merchandise before vnknowen, and haue brought them from a sauage and brutish life, to liue ciuilly and more humanely. But those parts which are situate in an equall and temperat climate, there nature administreth all things necessary for the maintenance of man and beast. Now when as those Nations which do inhabite and dwell in fertile and rich countries, are maintainers of peace and quietnesse; and those which are seated in barren and vn∣fruitfull countries, are most hardy and stout: it commeth to passe that both are helpfull one to another; while these do vse their weapons for their countries defence, those againe do help and maintaine them by the profits that they raise out of the earth, by their arts and mysteries, as also by their learning, wisedome and policy: euen as in like maner also the dammage is mutuall and either side feeleth a sensible hurt, when the one part doth not helpe the other: yet the estate of the souldier and warlike man is somewhat better, if they be not one come with multitude. And the nature of</HI> Europe <HI>serueth very fitly for this purpose: for it is all diuersly distinguished by lofty mountaines and lowly plaines; so that euery where the husbandmen and souldiers; the politicians and the martiall warriers do dwell together: yet so as the greatest number are peaceable men: which kind of life they enioy especially by the meanes and labour of their captaines, first of the Greekes, then of the Macedonians; and lastly of the Romanes. Therefore both in peace and warre it is sufficient of it selfe to maintaine and defend it selfe: for it hath great plenty both of stout souldiers, painfull husbandmen, and politique statesmen. In this also it doth excell, that it bringeth foorth passing good fruits, such I meane, as are necessary for the maintenance of mans life: with all sorts of mettall, for what vse soeuer. Spices or sweet smelling things and preti∣ous stones, are brought hither from forren countries, WHICH THINGS VVHOSOEVER HAVE NOT, THEY LIVE NEVER A VVHIT WORSE THAN THOSE DO THAT HAVE THEM. Moreouer this is especially worth the noting, that hauing wonderfull store of cattell, sheep and oxen; it breedeth very few dangerous wild beasts.</HI> Thus farre the learned <HI>Strabo.</HI> Many other things thou maist read of this <HI>Europe,</HI> together with the nature and condition of the people of the same, in that treatise which <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the prince of Phisitions, wrote of the care and waters. This <HI>Europe</HI> also, and not any other place of the world beside, doth yeeld <HI>Succinum</HI> or <HI>Electrum,</HI> (Amber we call it, the Germanes, <HI>Gleslum</HI>) yet it is not found in <HI>Eridianas,</HI> a riuer falling into some Northren sea, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> doth fabulously report: or in <HI>Padus,</HI> a riuer of <HI>Italy (Po)</HI> as the poets iestingly af∣firme: nor in the <HI>Electrides,</HI> certaine fained ilands in the Hadriaticke sea, as some men of better credit, and more diligent searchers out of the truth, as <HI>Pliny</HI>

In the same <HI>Europe</HI> are there many goodly and stately cities, amongst the which the most famous, in all ages, are <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> (which afterward was called <HI>New-Rome</HI>) and now are <HI>London, Venice</HI> and <HI>Paris.</HI> The riuers of greater note are <HI>Rhein, Isther</HI> or <HI>Donaw,</HI> and the <HI>Thames:</HI> the woods more notable are <HI>Ardene</HI> in <HI>Gallia, 500.</HI> miles of length, reaching from the riuer of <HI>Rhein</HI> vn∣to <HI>Tourney</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and <HI>Hercynia</HI> in <HI>Germany, 40.</HI> daies iourney long, as <HI>Pomponius</HI> writeth, and <HI>9.</HI> daies iourney broad, as <HI>Caesar</HI> in his Commen∣taries reporteth: a greater wood than which, or more vast, there is no history maketh mention of. Thus much of <HI>Europe.</HI> But whereof it tooke the name and was so called, or who first gaue it that name, I thinke saith <HI>Herodotius,</HI> there is no man vnder heauen doth certainly know or can vpon any probalibity gesse, except one should thinke it so called of <HI>Europa Tyria.</HI> But wherefore it should so of her be named, I am wholly ignorant, and I perswade my selfe and do verily beleeue, that no man in the world doth truly know. For that she, as we read in the fabulous stories of the poets, was violently taken out of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> a country of <HI>Asia,</HI> and caried from thence into <HI>Cyprus,</HI> or as others write, into the iland <HI>Creta (Candy)</HI> all men do know well enough: where, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> his Chronicle doth witnesse, being taken of <HI>Asterius</HI> king of <HI>Creta</HI> to wife, she bare him <HI>Minoes, Rhadamanthus</HI> and <HI>Sarpedon:</HI> from whence she went not into <HI>Europe,</HI> but into <HI>Asia,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> hath left recorded. But what is that to <HI>Europe</HI> this part of the world? One might easilier beleeue it to haue been so named of <HI>Europus,</HI> who, as <HI>Trogus Pompeius</HI> witnesseth, sometime in these parts possessed a large kingdome: which also I do see to be auouched by <HI>Eusta∣thius</HI> vpon <HI>Lycophron,</HI> who maketh this <HI>Europus</HI> to be the sonne of one <HI>Himerus. Pausanias</HI> saith that one <HI>Europa</HI> was king of <HI>Sicyonia,</HI> a prouince of <HI>Peleponnesus</HI> in <HI>Greece:</HI> to him <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his Chronicle doth ascribe, who maketh him equall to the Patriarke <HI>Abraham,</HI> &amp; to haue liued aboue <HI>3550.</HI> yeares since, about <HI>1950.</HI> yeares before the birth of Christ. There be some, as <HI>Festus</HI> writeth, that thinke it so named of the <HI>beautifulnesse and excellency of the country.</HI> These we are sure are fabulous or vncertaine: may we not therefore, as they haue formed of <HI>Phrat, Euphrates,</HI> and of <HI>Koft, Aegyptus</HI> (as we haue shewed before) thinke that of <HI>Riphath</HI> (the sonne of <HI>Gomer, Iapheths</HI> sonne, to whom this part of the world was presently after the confusion at <HI>Ba∣bel,</HI> assigned) they haue likewise formed <HI>Europa?</HI> And surely the name <HI>Riphath,</HI> doth very manifestly shew it selfe in <HI>Riphaeis montibus,</HI> the Riphean hils: item in <HI>Riphaeo fluuio,</HI> now called the riuer <HI>Oby,</HI> in <HI>Ripe,</HI> a city of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> in <HI>Rhiphataeis,</HI> the people of <HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> as <HI>Iosephus</HI> writeth. <HI>Pto∣lemey</HI> in the second booke of his <HI>Quadripartite,</HI> in my opinion much more truly, writeth that it was sometime called by a common name, <HI>CELTICA,</HI> name∣ly of a principall Nation that first did inhabite it. For there is almost no prouince in all this part, in which in time past the <HI>CELTAE</HI> did not inhabit. For in <HI>Spaine toward the West, and beyond</HI> Hercules <HI>pillars are the</HI> Celtae as <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirmeth. <HI>Item, about the riuer</HI> Baetis, as <HI>Strabo</HI> auoucheth, <HI>the</HI> Ciltica Praesamarci, <HI>are in the prouince of</HI> Lucensis, <HI>and others otherwise named</HI> Nerij, as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith: <HI>Dion</HI> and <HI>Xiphilinus</HI> do shew that <HI>the</HI> Canta∣bri <HI>and</HI> Astares <HI>are the same with the</HI> Celtae: <HI>Pliny</HI> nameth the city <HI>Celtica, in the prouince</HI> Hispalensis. <HI>Antonius</HI> hath the <HI>Celti: item</HI> Celticum promontorium, <HI>is the same that</HI> Cantabrum promontorium, which now is called <HI>Cabo de finis terre.</HI> What Geographer or Historian is he amongst the anci∣ents that hath not made mention of the <HI>Celtebri?</HI> In <HI>France were the</HI> Celtae <HI>and</HI> Celtogalatae: and from thence are those in <HI>Britaine.</HI> For that this iland was first peopled from hence, lying so neere ouer against it, it is a common opinion and very probable. That <HI>the Gauls Germanes were vulgarly called</HI> Celtae, all Historiographers do iointly agree: and indeed <HI>Dion</HI> doth affirme, that <HI>the</HI> Celtae <HI>did dwell vpon either side of the riuer</HI> Rhein: <HI>the</HI> Celtae <HI>dwelt in</HI> Gal∣lia Cisalpina <HI>(Lombardy)</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>Appianus</HI> writeth. And againe <HI>vpon the Ionian sea,</HI> (that is, the <HI>Hadriaticke</HI>) which also <HI>Strabo</HI> doth auerre. <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> placeth them <HI>about the riuer Eridianus (Po). In Epirus sometime dwelled the Celtae,</HI> as <HI>Antonius Liberalis</HI> hath giuen out: <HI>Stepha∣nus</HI> placeth the same <HI>about the mount</HI> Haemus: Arrianus, <HI>neere the mouth of the riuer</HI> Donaw: as also <HI>Strabo</HI> in <HI>Moesia.</HI> The same authour writeth, that <HI>the Celtae are intermedled with the Illyrij and Thraces.</HI> Who also placeth them <HI>vpon the riuer</HI> Borysthenes. Moreouer Aristotle in his booke De mundo, <HI>ioineth the Celtae with the Scythians.</HI> Heere hence the same Strabo and Plutarch do make their <HI>Celtoscythae.</HI> In Plutarch, in the life of Camil∣lus, I read that <HI>the Galatae</HI> (which he maketh to haue come of the stocke of the Celtae) <HI>passing the Northren sea came vnto the Riphaean mountaines.</HI> Againe out of the forenamed Strabo I learne that <HI>the Nations dwelling Northward were in his time called Caltae.</HI> The which also their ancient lan∣guage, which is called the <HI>Celticke or Germane tongue,</HI> doth at this day sufficiently demonstrate: which is the same (only differing a little in dialect) with that <HI>which is vsed in the ilands neere adioining</HI> to these places, as in Island, Groenland, Friesland and others in this ocean. Plutarke in Marius wri∣teth, that <HI>Celtica doth begin at the outmost sea</HI> (that is, the Atlanticke sea) <HI>and so stretcheth it selfe out farre into the North and from thence vn∣to the fenne Maeoris,</HI> (Mare delle Zabacche.) Pomponius Mela calleth <HI>the Cassiterides</HI> (which in another place we haue proued to belong to great Britaine, or to be of the number of those which are named Brittanicae) <HI>Celticke Ilands.</HI> What is this else, I pray you, than plainly to affirme that <HI>THE CELTAE DO POSSESSE ALL EVROPE?</HI> Which indeed is that which <HI>Ephorus</HI> in <HI>Strabo</HI> did see so many yeares since: when as he diuiding all the world into <HI>4.</HI> quar∣ters, saith that, <HI>That part which is toward the East, is inhabited of the</HI> Indians: <HI>that which is in the South, of the</HI> Aethiopians: <HI>the North parts, of the</HI> Scythians: <HI>and the West, of the</HI> Celtae. The scholiast of Appollonius nameth <HI>the Hadriaticke sea, Mare Celticum,</HI> the Celticke sea. And Lyco∣phron describeth <HI>Celtos, a certaine poole, about the mouth of the riuer Ister.</HI> Item he placeth <HI>Leuce an iland of Mar maiore</HI> (Pontus Euxinus) <HI>o∣uer against the mouth of the riuer Donaw.</HI> May we not therefore properly, as they call those that inhabit Asia, Asians: and those which dwell in Africa, Africanes: call these which dwell in Celtica, Celtickes? He that out of all ancient stories, penned either in Latine or Greeke doth not know that the Celtae are the Germanes, let him haue recourse to the <HI>22.</HI> chapter of Hadrianus Iunius his Batauia, and I doubt not but, hauing throughly waied those many sound ar∣guments, and sufficient testimonies of ancient graue writers, shall rest satisfied and sweare to our opinion. If not, let him listen to the Dutchmen, and he shall heare them call one another in their familiar communication, <HI>Kelt.</HI> The French also or Gauls I call a German nation. And I can proue by good arguments, if it were a matter pertaining to this our purpose, that the Germane or Dutch tongue is the ancient language of the <HI>Celtae,</HI> and to be the same which hitherto they haue vsed in all places and now is spoken, except in some places where the power of the Romanes so preuailed, that they banished this, and seated theirs in the roome. It is likely therefore that the etymology and reason of the deriuation of the word <HI>Europe,</HI> which was vnknowen vnto the old writers, is to be sought and fetched from no other language else, but from that which was most vsuall in this part of the world. For that the inhabitants of any country should take the name of their natiue soile from strangers, it is so absurd and hard to be beleeued, that there cannot any thing more foolish or contrary to truth be inuen∣ted or deuised. Wherefore I thinke it good, concerning this matter, heere to lay downe the iudgement of <HI>Goropius Becanus,</HI> our countryman, who thinketh it to be so named, not of a woman, (which it is probable, either neuer was, or neuer came heere) but <HI>à latitudine videndi,</HI> of the largenesse of his prospect (as he speaketh) namely, because (I do cite his owne words out of the <HI>9.</HI> booke of his <HI>Origines</HI>) it doth not only looke toward Asia, on the East and South: Africa, on the South and West: but also the New-found-world beyond the Hyperborei, on the West and North. Neither shall any man perswade me, that <HI>Europe</HI> had the name from <HI>Greece</HI> or the Greeke language, seeing that it was first inhabited of the Cimbers (<HI>Cimmerij,</HI> descended from <HI>Gomer,</HI> the elder brother) before it was possessed of the Greeks (<HI>Iones,</HI> come from <HI>Iawan</HI> a yonger brother, &amp; but the <HI>4.</HI> son of <HI>Yapheth</HI>) we make a dipthong by setting the <HI>5.</HI> vowel of the Latins before the <HI>2.</HI> which neither the Latins nor Greeks do admit. Therefore if so be at any time they would change the words in which this did light, for <HI>We,</HI> they put <HI>Eu;</HI> turning it backward. Therefore our men do term it <HI>Verop,</HI> not <HI>Europ,</HI> whereby they vnderstand a worthy <HI>company of men:</HI> for <HI>Wer</HI> (a mono-syllable pronounced like a dipthong) signifieth <HI>losty, great, excellent &amp; that which is best in euery kind of thing:</HI> which notwithstanding some do write <HI>ur,</HI> without a dipthong, yet with a long vowell. Therefore, as of <HI>Terues,</HI> they formed <HI>Tereus,</HI> so of <HI>Werop,</HI> the Latines &amp; Greeks haue made <HI>Europe:</HI> so named of the excellency of the Nation, which doth farre surpasse all other men of the World. For <HI>Hop,</HI> as I haue shewed before, signifieth a company or multitude of men. More of this word thou maist see in his <HI>8.</HI> booke Thus farre out of his workes which are foorth in print: that which followeth, is taken out of a booke of his which he also hath set foorth, yet not imprinted, but such as he vsed priuatly, and hath many additions in sundrie places in the margin written with his owne hand, which he had prepared against the second edition. But I waighing, saith he, and comparing this name with that which I haue read in holy Scripture, a∣nother reason farre more excellent, and better commeth into my mind. We see that to <HI>Yaphet</HI> was promised enlargement or a farre spreading of his posterity, or as some other interpret the word, ioy and gladnesse: which then he truly had enioied, when as Christ had redeemed vs by his death and pretious bloud (which blessing doth agree to this part of the world, rather than to any other vnder heauen beside: and therefore all other countries generall do call <HI>Europe: THE KINGDOME OF THE CHRISTIANS:</HI> and the Europeans, are called of the Turkes and Arabians, <HI>GIAVVR,</HI> that is, Christians.) <HI>E,</HI> therefore doth signifie a lawfull contract and mariage: <HI>VR,</HI> excellent: and <HI>HOP,</HI> hope: whereupon it commeth to passe, that <HI>Europe</HI> signifieth <HI>The excellent hope of a lawfull mariage.</HI> which is proper to this portion of the world which <HI>Noah</HI> gaue to <HI>Iapheth</HI> his sonne to inhabite. For although that the posterity of <HI>Sem</HI> was by <HI>Abraham,</HI> for many ages wedded to God, yet at length he put her away and diuorced her from him. But the wedlocke whereby God, by Christ is wed∣ded to <HI>Europe</HI> his Church, shall neuer be dissolued: so that <HI>Europe</HI> may most properly be said to be <HI>Iaphets</HI> portion. But of this word we will speake more in our <HI>Francica.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Goropius.</HI> Which I haue very willingly communicated to the curtuous Reader, leauing it to the censure of the learned to be iud∣ged. Yet I know that these things haue been very bitterly skoffed at already by a certaine learned man, but one wholly ignorant of this tongue, and therefore of lesse iudgement in this argument. There are some which do thinke that this <HI>Europe</HI> was in the holy Scripture called <HI>IAPETIA.</HI> Thus farre of <HI>Europe,</HI> to which before I do altogether leaue, I will ad out of <HI>Herodotus</HI> in his <HI>Polymnia,</HI> the words of <HI>Mardonius</HI> to <HI>Darius</HI> spoken of this country. <HI>That it is a country most goodly and beautifull, bearing all maner of excellent fruitefull trees, and those in their kind the best: and to be such that it were pi∣ty that any man but a king only should possesse.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The BRITISH ILES, Now, THE EMPIRE OF <HI>Great Britaine.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Liny</HI> saith that in the Atlanticke ocean, there be many ilands named <HI>BRITANNICAE INSVLAE, The British ilands;</HI> but the two greater <HI>ALBION</HI> and <HI>HIBERNIA, (Ireland)</HI> are properly so called. Of these, <HI>ALBION,</HI> in regard that it is both the greatest, and as it were commander of the rest, is most properly called <HI>BRITANNIA.</HI> And I might easily be drawen to beleeue, that all these ilands were recorded in the ancient monuments of the Greekes, before they were once named or knowen to the Romanes; and to haue generally been called <HI>CASSITERIDES,</HI> as who say, <HI>The Stannaries,</HI> and that properly <HI>CASSITERA,</HI> which the Romans call <HI>Britannia.</HI> And although I am not ignorant, that <HI>Cassitera</HI> is held of <HI>Dionysius</HI> and <HI>Stephanus</HI> to be <HI>Indica Insula,</HI> an Indi∣an an iland, or, an iland belonging or neere adioining to <HI>India,</HI> yet I am not a whitte moued from that my opinion. For I do verily thinke that this was deliuered by them rather of ignorance, than of sound knowledge grounded vpon the skill of Geography: and we know that this is also a common errour in these our daies, to call all countries and ilands vnknowen or farre remote and distant from vs, <HI>Indian iles;</HI> by which name, not without a manifest ignorance of the truth, they call all that whole continent of the <HI>New world,</HI> together with the circumiacent ilands first discouered and found out in the daies of our grandfathers; and such also as daily are descried, they call by that name. On my side is <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> a man out of all doubt, of good iudgement and credit, who calleth them <HI>CELTICAS, Celtickeiles;</HI> as if they were neere neighbours to the <HI>Celtae.</HI> I do know that these <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> are of others otherwise described; as of <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> a little aboue <HI>Lusitania (Portu∣gall)</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI> oueragainst <HI>Celtiberia, (Valentia)</HI> neere <HI>Artabrum promontorium (cabo de finis terrae)</HI> by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey:</HI> where now there are no ilands at all; (and therefore not these) nor euer were any: whereupon it is apparant that these ilands were rather known to the ancients by name, than true situation. Now all men do iointly commend these ilands for the great abundance of <HI>Tinne</HI> and <HI>Lead,</HI> which they yearely did yeeld: <HI>Strabo</HI> also maketh these ilands rich in <HI>Hides</HI> or Leather. Do not then these three, whose plentifull store, hath made <HI>ENGLAND</HI> at this day so famous all the world ouer, manifestly proue that they all pointed and aimed at <HI>Britaine?</HI> For what country or prouince is there in the whole globe of the Earth, that is so rich in <HI>Pelts</HI> and <HI>Leather:</HI> or hath such plenty of fine wooll, as <HI>ENGLAND</HI> hath? The same <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth, that in the <HI>Cassiterides</HI> they digge not very deep for mettals. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith that they are found in the very sourd of the earth. That these do speake both of the same thing, who doth not see? By these I gather, That the Phoenicians in times past, and Spaniards, did for trafficke saile through the straights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> vnto this iland; and for Tinne, Lead and Pelts bring in for exchange Brasen vessels and Salt: like as afterward the Romanes, when <HI>Caesar</HI> had subdued it, vsed to do the next way ouer land by <HI>France.</HI> Therefore it was then first knowen to the Romanes, by the name of <HI>Britannia,</HI> which before that, certaine ages passed, was very famous amongst the Phoenicians by the name of <HI>Cassitera. Appianus</HI> a reuerend authour, who liued about the time of <HI>Hadrian</HI> the Emperour, writeth that the Spaniards did forbeare to trauell vpon the West and North ocean, but when they were forced into <HI>Britaine,</HI> by the violence of the tide. That heere he nameth <HI>Britaine, Cassitera,</HI> I make no question: but that name was then worne out of vse, and this, as I thinke it very likely, was growen in request and better knowne. Let the learned see, and at their better leisure consider, whether that <HI>Sextus Rufus Auienus</HI> doth not describe these ilands vnder the name of <HI>OESTRYMNIDVM?</HI> Surely I am of that opinion he doth. For he saith that these <HI>Oestrymniades,</HI> are very rich of lead and tinne: and that the country people do make shippes of Leather, in which they saile vpon the maine sea. What is this else then that which <HI>Pliny</HI> reporteth, That the Britanes do go to sea in shippes made of wickers and couered ouer with raw hides? and doth not <HI>Caesar</HI> in his first booke <HI>de Bello ciuili,</HI> affirme that the Britans did vse to make the keele and ribbes of their ships of some light wood, the other part being radled with osiers or roddes was couered with leather? This iland the Romanes, as <HI>Dion</HI> and <HI>Xiphiline</HI> do testifie, diui∣ded into the <HI>HIGHER,</HI> containing all that part which is toward the South: and the <HI>LOVVER,</HI> toward the North. In the Almagest of <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> this is called <HI>MINOR, The Lesser:</HI> and that <HI>MAIOR, The Greater:</HI> and that about the time of <HI>Seuerus</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome.</HI> But in the raigne of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the Em∣perour, I find in <HI>Sextus Rufus,</HI> that it was distinguished by these names, <HI>BRITANNIA PRIMA,</HI> The First, <HI>BRITANNIA SECVNDA,</HI> The Second, <HI>BRITANNIA MAXIMA,</HI> The Greater, <HI>CAESARIENSIS</HI> and <HI>FLAVIA.</HI> The booke of Remembrances <HI>(Notiar)</HI> and <HI>Ammianus</HI> do adde <HI>VALEN∣TIA;</HI> which others, as <HI>Orosius, Claudian</HI> and <HI>Hegesippus</HI> call <HI>SCOTIA, Scotland. Xiphilinus</HI> in <HI>Seuerus</HI> referreth the people generally to these two nations, <HI>MAEATAI</HI> and <HI>CALEDONII:</HI> for the names of the rest may, as he saith, welnigh be reduced to these two. (Yet this must needes be false except he meane it par∣ticularly of <HI>Valentia,</HI> the later part.) He that desireth to know the seuerall Nations of this iland as then it was inhabited, let him haue recourse to <HI>Ptolemeys</HI> Geo∣graphy, and this our Mappe, into which we haue packed those things which we haue gathered heere and there dispersed in <HI>Caesars</HI> Commentaries, <HI>Tacitus, Pausani∣as</HI> and <HI>Ammianus;</HI> and he shalbe satisfied to the full. But wilt not thou be deceiued? take the learned M. <HI>Camden</HI> for thy guide: and then I will warrant thy safe conduct. Thus farre of the names of these ilands: now let vs speake in like manner of the iles themselues, and first of the greatest of them which we said was called <HI>Britannia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> vnto <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great writeth, <HI>That this ile for greatnesse doth exceed the rest. Tacitus</HI> testifieth, <HI>That it is the greatest of all ilands that the Romanes euer had notice of.</HI> It is so great, as <HI>Appian</HI> writeth, that it might seeme to be <HI>ANOTHER CONTINENT.</HI> And <HI>Hegesippus</HI> calleth it <HI>A∣NOTHER WORLD. Caesar, Diodorus, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> do make it to be <HI>Three cornered:</HI> and so it may aswell as <HI>Sicilia</HI> be called <HI>TRINACRIA. Taci∣tus</HI> out of <HI>Liuy</HI> and <HI>Fabius Rusticus</HI> do liken it to a <HI>Swingling stocke,</HI> or the warlike weapon <HI>Bipennis,</HI> a twall, or battle-axe. <HI>Iornandes</HI> saith, It is fashioned like a <HI>Conus,</HI> that is, to a Geometricall body, which like a taper, is broad at the bottome and sharpe at the toppe. <HI>Nubiensis</HI> the Arabian, who wrote about fiue or six hundred yeares since, likeneth it to <HI>the head and necke of</HI> Alnaama, <HI>an ostrich.</HI> This Iland was first descried and made knowen to the Romane Empire in the time of <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> the tyrant, <HI>who first of all men</HI> (I vnderstand it of the Romans) <HI>entered it with a thousand saile of shippes,</HI> as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> in his sixth booke hath left re∣corded. For <HI>before that,</HI> as <HI>Dion</HI> in his <HI>39.</HI> booke testifieth, <HI>whether there were such an iland or not, it was vncertaine.</HI> The later writers made a doubt whether it were a part of the maine land, or an ile apart by it selfe: and of this argument they haue written much on both sides, who indeed knew nothing for certaine of it (them∣selues hauing neuer seen it, or learned by the inhabitants what it was) but only by gesse had written of it coniecturally, as euery one had more leasure or learning. In pro∣cesse of time, first when <HI>Agricola</HI> was vice-praetor (which I vnderstand by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> was vnder <HI>Vespasian</HI>) then againe, in our daies, saith <HI>Dion,</HI> vnder <HI>Seuerus,</HI> it was manifestly found to be but an iland, and not of the Continent. Before the comming of these men, the iland had neuer borne the yoke of any forren Prince, as <HI>Dio∣dorus Siculus</HI> teacheth. It was gouerned by many princes: the common people for the most part bore the sway and had a kind of soueraignty, as we learne out of <HI>Cae∣sar, Strabo, Xiphiline,</HI> and <HI>Tacitus:</HI> who also moreouer doth adde, that by their princes they are drawne to many factions and taking of contrary parts: and that they neuer haue any common counsell for the state of the whole common-wealth: so that while they fight seuerally, they are seuerally conquered. <HI>The temperature of the aire,</HI> saith Caesar, <HI>is more mild than in</HI> France, <HI>the frosts and cold are not so eger. Tacitus</HI> affirmeth, That heere is neuer any bitter cold weather. <HI>Stra∣bo</HI> writeth, that the aire is rather subiect to clowdes than snow. <HI>Herodian</HI> teacheth, that the aire is thicke and foggie: and he thinketh the reason, to be the heat and vapours which do ascend vp out of the fennes and marshes. In <HI>Britaine,</HI> (saith <HI>Minutius Felix,</HI> the diuine) the heat of the Sunne is not great, but it is comforted and hartened by a warme and hot streame of the sea, which inuironeth it on euery side. The same forenamed <HI>Strabo</HI> saith, that the most part of the iland is plaine and cham∣pion, beset with woods and groues: to haue also some earthy hils, but very craggie, and drie without water, as <HI>Xiphiline</HI> writeth: moreouer some plaines, desert and full of fennes and bogges. This last <HI>Herodian</HI> auoucheth to be true, who saith that by reason of the frequent ouerflowing of the sea, it is fenny and moorish in diuers pla∣ces. Notwithstanding the <HI>Panegyricus</HI> maketh it a very fertile and fruitfull soile for <HI>Corne;</HI> yet it is better for grasse than corne, and is more kind to beast than man, as <HI>Mela</HI> affirmeth: and therefore heere is infinite store of cattell, as <HI>Caesar</HI> hath left recorded. Yet it beareth <HI>Wheat</HI> and <HI>Rie,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> testifieth, and that by the meanes of their great store of marle: for this, <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, doth assure the Britans of greater fertility: which in the time of the Emperour <HI>Iulian,</HI> was so luxurious and superabundant, that as <HI>Marcelline</HI> in his eighteenth booke iustifieth, they haue sent ouer corne and prouision into <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> The same history <HI>Zozimus</HI> doth approue. It yeeldeth all maner of commodities other things as <HI>France</HI> doth, (excepting the <HI>beech</HI> and <HI>firre</HI> tree) yea Hares, Hennes and Geese, as the forenamed <HI>Caesar</HI> doth testifie. <HI>Xiphiline</HI> out of <HI>Dion</HI> doth highly coommend it for wonderfull store of all sorts of <HI>Fish: Solinus</HI> as much for the great variety and plen∣ty of <HI>Mettals.</HI> All the world did euer admire it for the infinite abundance of <HI>Tinne</HI> and <HI>Lead.</HI> Especially vp higher within the country, as <HI>Caesar</HI> would haue it. Whose opinion <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in a maner doth gainesay: who affirmeth that mettals are plentifully found in <HI>Cornewall,</HI> neere the promontory which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> called, <HI>Antiuestaeum</HI> and <HI>Bolerium:</HI> the same <HI>Diodorus, Belerium: Nubiensis Tarfi'lgarbey mina'lgiezira;</HI> The outmost bound of the iland toward the West: or as our seamen call it, <HI>The lands end,</HI> and <HI>The cape of Cornewall.</HI> Beside these mettals, the same authour saith, that it yeeldeth also <HI>Iron,</HI> but not in any great quan∣tity, and that in like maner toward the sea coast. <HI>Item, Pliny</HI> doth testifie, that it affoordeth <HI>Lead</HI> in great abundance euen in the vpper sourd of the earth. It hath also some veines of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Siluer,</HI> if we will beleeue <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> two authours of good credit. <HI>Item,</HI> the prophecies of <HI>Sibylla</HI> do auouch it to be rich in Gold: peraduenture, saith <HI>Ortelius,</HI> in respect of that plenty that is brought in thither: for <HI>Cicero</HI> vnto <HI>Trebatius</HI> writeth, that the ile of it selfe doth not yeeld one dramme of Gold or siluer: and that nothing is to be caried from thence, nor any maner of booty to be expected, more than that which may arise of slaues. But <HI>Cicero</HI> heere spake like a lawyer, not like a Philosopher, and louer of the truth. For our histories do approue that there haue been mines, of both those mettals informer a∣ges, found both in <HI>England, Wales</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> and the like no doubt we now might find, if we would seeke for them with the like diligence. <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> do write that heere are many and great riuers which do affoord both pearle and pretious stones. These pearles are the best in value and estimation, next to those of <HI>In∣dia,</HI> in the iudgement of <HI>Aelianus:</HI> the hope and gaine of these. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, first moued <HI>Caesar</HI> to assault this iland. <HI>Heliodorus</HI> doth highlie commend the <HI>Ame∣thyst</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> I read in <HI>Solinus</HI> that heere are hot baths (<HI>fontes calidi,</HI> Bathe, I vnderstand) very curiously carued and trimmed for the vse of man: these

<PB REF="263"/> fountaine, he saith, are consecrated to <HI>Minerua,</HI> she is president of them. <HI>Heliodorus</HI> ascribeth also the <HI>Amethyst,</HI> a pretious stone, to this country. Heere also is the <HI>Agath (gagares)</HI> the best in his kind, as <HI>Solinus</HI> and the old interpreter of <HI>Dionysius</HI> do iointly testifie. <HI>Pliny,</HI> many yeares since, it seemeth had heard of our <HI>English Outers:</HI> which one commended who thus wrote of them; — <HI>Rutupinoquè edita fundo, Ostrea callebat primo deprehendere morsu.</HI> The Poet <HI>Gratius</HI> doth highly commend the <HI>English Dogges,</HI> which are transported from hence, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, for the excellent quality which naturally they haue for their sure hunting: which also <HI>Nemesianus</HI> was not ignorant of, when he thus wrote of them, — <HI>Diuisa Britannia mittit Veloces, nostri{que} Orbis venatibus aptos. Britaine</HI> that <HI>Other World,</HI> hath alwaies borne the name, For swiftest hounds, and best for hunters game. <HI>Symma∣chus</HI> writeth vnto <HI>Flauianus</HI> his brother, that in time past the Romanes did greatly admire the English dogges: and <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth that the Gauls did vse their helpe in the warres. There is a kind of these which are lesse than the common sort, which I find described in <HI>Oppianus</HI> his booke of hunting: <HI>Agassae∣us,</HI> he calleth it, a beagle, or gase-hound: See M. <HI>Camdens Britannia.</HI> Whether in former times it hath had wine or not (for <HI>Tacitus</HI> flatly denieth that it will beare vines or oliue trees) I dare not affirme: yet I vnderstand by <HI>Vopiscus,</HI> that <HI>Aurelianus</HI> the Emperour did suffer the Britans to plant vines, and to make wine. <HI>Item,</HI> the <HI>Panegyricus,</HI> an oration made to <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, doth atttribute to this ile so great a fertility of corne and all sorts of graine, that it hath sufficient both bread corne and drinke corne to maintaine it selfe. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth that <HI>Sotacus</HI> verily beleeued that Amber <HI>(Electrum)</HI> heere dropped out of certaine trees, which they therefore called <HI>Electrides,</HI> amber trees, a feigned story inuented by the old writers: as also this perhaps which <HI>Clemens</HI> in the sixth booke of his <HI>Stromaton,</HI> writeth from the relation of <HI>Heruetus:</HI> they which write histories, do report that in <HI>Britannia (Britannice,</HI> the Greeke copy hath) there is a certaine caue vnderneath an hill, in whose roppe is a chincke or rift: when the wind driueth into the caue, and beateth a∣gainst the sides of is, there is heard a sound, as it were of cymbals making a melodious harmony. Like as that of <HI>Solinus</HI> also is, who writeth, that there is an altar <HI>(ara)</HI> in a by-place, or odde corner in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> a part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which by the inscription written in Greeke letters, doth manifestly shew that <HI>V∣lysses</HI> had landed there to performe some vow that he had made. And whether euer this ile were ioined to the maine continent or not, as <HI>Seruius</HI> is perswa∣ded I dare not affirme. Now it remaineth that we in like maner do speake something of the people of the same.</P>
<P><HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> do giue out that it is wonderfull populous: But from whence the people and first inhabitants came, whether they were home∣borne <HI>(indigenae)</HI> or come from other countries, it is not knowen as <HI>Tacitus</HI> hath written. The inner partes, higher within the land, are inhabited of those which they say, were borne and bred there: the sea coasts are possessed of those which came thither from <HI>Belgium</HI> (the Low countries) all of them almost are called by the names of those cities and prouinces from whence they came, and where they were bred, as <HI>Caesar</HI> reporteth. This his opinion <HI>Ptolemey</HI> doth con∣firme, who in this ile also doth name and describe the <HI>Belgae</HI> and <HI>Attrebates. Tacitus</HI> auoucheth that in that the <HI>Caledonij,</HI> (a people in <HI>Scotland</HI>) are red haired and bigge limmed, it is a manifest argument that they are come of the stocke of the <HI>Germaines.</HI> Their well coloured complections, curled heads, and country opposite to the coast of <HI>Spaine,</HI> do proue that the ancient <HI>Iberi,</HI> in former times had crossed the sea and seated themselues heere. That the <HI>Galli</HI> or <HI>Gauls</HI> did enter vpon those coasts neere to their country, it is very probable by their ceremonies, superstitious opinions, and similitude of languages. <HI>Zozi∣mus</HI> in his first booke writeth that the Emperour <HI>Probus,</HI> sent into this iland all the <HI>Burgundians</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> that he could suppresse and take aliue, that heere they might dwell and seat themselues. The <HI>Saxons</HI> and other nations which entered this land, I do of purpose omit: because these were of later times and but the other day: we only determined to touch those things that were of greater antiquity. Generally the inhabitants of this ile, in those daies, were all vnciuill and rude: and as they were more farther remote from the maine continent, so they had lesse knowledge of forren wealth and were lesse desirous of the same. <HI>That the Britans were more valiant and hardy than the Gauls,</HI> we learne out of Tacitus: <HI>that they were more taller of stature than they,</HI> Stra∣bo doth affirme: <HI>That they vsed strangers discurteously,</HI> Horace reporteth: <HI>Claudianus</HI> the poet nameth this ile <HI>saeua Britannia,</HI> tyrannous <HI>Britaine.</HI> And the same authour in his <HI>Panegyricus,</HI> for the Consulship of <HI>Honorius,</HI> calleth the people <HI>saeuos Britannos,</HI> cruell Britans. <HI>Quid</HI> in his second book of Loue, nameth them <HI>virides Britannos,</HI> the green Britans: in the fifteenth booke of his Metamorphosis, <HI>Aequoreos Britannos,</HI> the Britans of the sea. They weare their haire long, all their body in what part soeuer being shauen, beside their head and vpper lippe. The same authour saith that for nature and quality they are for the most part all alike, yet some are more plaine and simply minded, others more rude and barbarous: so that although they haue great store of milke, yet they know not how to make cheese: others are wholly ignorant of sowing, planting, grafting and of such other points of husbandrie. In their cari∣age and conuersation they are, as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> speaketh of them, plaine, simple and vpright, farre remote from the wily subtillies and crafty deuices of our men which liue more neere the Court. They fare basely and feed vpon grosse meats, and are wholly estranged from wealth and gorgeous life and mainte∣tenance: and as <HI>Mela</HI> saith of them, they are only rich in cattell, and great lands and compasse of ground. For they do not hold it lawfull to eat either hare, henne or goose: notwithstanding they keepe them, as <HI>Caesar</HI> writeth, for game and pastime. Yet they haue a kind of geese heere, which they call <HI>chenerotes, (bernacles)</HI> which they esteeme for great dainties, so that in <HI>England</HI> they haue not a daintier dish, as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifieth. They feed vpon milke and flesh meat, as the same authour saith. They lay their corne vp in their barnes in the eare of sheaffe vnthrashed: from whence they fetch and thrash as much as shall serue them from day to day. Of their temperate and sparing diet, together with their patience in aduersity and affliction, <HI>Dion</HI> in the life of <HI>Nero</HI> will teach thee. That they did make their drinke, which they called <HI>Curmi,</HI> (or as now they pronounce it <HI>Courow,</HI> ale) of barley, <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> that famous physition, or in∣dustrious and painfull student and searcher out of the true nature of medicinall simples, so many hundred yeeres, hath left recorded. <HI>Zonaras</HI> writeth that they did vse to make a kind of meat, of which if any man should take but the quantity of a beane, he should neither be an hungred or a thirst for a great time. Beleeue him that list. Of the same Britaines, <HI>Herodian</HI> thus writeth: they weare no kind of garment: onely about their neckes they claspe a piece of iron, thinking that to bee as great a iewell and signe of wealth, as other barbarous nations do by gold. <HI>Caesar</HI> saith that they be clad in skins and leather. They vsed to haue tenne or twelue wiues common amongst a certaine company of them: especially brothers with brothers and fathers with their sonnes were thus co-partners: but if any of them were gotten with child, whosoeuer got it, it was accounted to be his who first maried her when she was a maide. Thus <HI>Caesar</HI> in his time wrote of them. That many of them had but one wife onely, <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his seuenth booke <HI>de Praepar. euangel.</HI> hath giuen vs to vnderstand: which al∣so <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> in his <HI>9</HI> booke <HI>Recognitionum,</HI> doth auerre. <HI>Plutarch</HI> saith that they do ordinarily liue till they be an hundred and twenty yeares old. They vse brasen money or iron rings made of a certaine weight and poise, in steed of gold or siluer coines. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith that they vsed to weare rings vpon their middle finger. In <HI>Caesar</HI> I read, that their houses did stand thicke and close together: but as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, they were for the most part made of reeds, or timber. They dwell in woodes like as we do in cities. For they call that a towne, when they haue with a banke or ditch enclosed or fortified a combersome wood, whither they may flocke and resort, to auoid the inuasion and assault of their enemies: as <HI>Caesar</HI> in his commentaries doth giue vs to vnderstand: and there, as <HI>Strabo</HI> saith they make cabbines or cottages for themselues, and stables for cattle, such as may serue them for that present necessity. <HI>Herodian</HI> cal∣leth them a very warlike and bloudy nation. They fight not only on horsebacke and foote, but also with coches and waggons, armed after the maner of the Gauls; <HI>Couinos</HI> they call them, whose axeltrees or linces were armed with hookes made somewhat like to the Welch bils now adaies vsed, as <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> affirmeth; they vse likewise in their warres a great multitude of waines, as <HI>Caesar, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> do tell vs. They fight with huge great swords, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> signifieth: these swords, <HI>Herodian</HI> saith, hang close downe by their bare skinne: only sheathed in a streight peece of leather. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> writeth that they vsed to adorne the pommels of their swords with the teeth of certaine sea fish. They know not what a brigandine, iacke or head-peece meane: these peeces of armour they neuer vse, accounting them to be but a trouble and hinderance to them when they are to passe ouer any bogges or fennes. For they vse to swimme, runne through or to wade vp to the twist ouer those fennes and marishes, and many times being bare-legged they spare neither thicke nor thinne: yet afterward we learne out of <HI>Dion</HI> by the oration of <HI>Bunduica,</HI> their queen, that they were wont to arme themselues, for defence with helmets, habergions and greaus: when they gaue the on-set vpon their enemies the same authour teacheth vs, they vsed to make a great noise and to sing terrible and threatning songs. They make warre manie times vpon small occasions and for wantonnesse: and very often they inuade and annoy one another of set purpose; especiallie for a desire of further command and couetousnesse of enlarging their possessions. <HI>Tacitus</HI> moreouer affirmeth, that they also go in the field vnder the leading and conduct of women: for a manifest proofe of which he bringeth in (in the foureteenth booke of his Annals) <HI>Boudicea</HI> with her daughters. <HI>Dion</HI> affirmeth the same: but he calleth her <HI>Bunduica: item Tacitus.</HI> in the life of <HI>Iulius Agricola,</HI> writeth her name <HI>Voadica. Corpora inficiunt vltrò;</HI> they purposedly staine and paint their bodies: (there is a very learned man who thinketh that for <HI>vltrò,</HI> heere should be read <HI>nitro:</HI> with saltpeter) but wherefore or to what end they did it, that is vncertaine: <HI>Mela</HI> and <HI>Iornandes</HI> do thinke they did it for ornament and to set out themselues: or that they might seeme more terrible vnto their enemies in time of sight, as <HI>Caesar</HI> saith: who ouermore addeth that they thus paint their bodies with wood (<HI>Luteum,</HI> he calleth it) which will make a blew or skie-colour. Others heere for <HI>Luteum,</HI> do read <HI>Glastum:</HI> on whose side <HI>Pliny</HI> seemeth to speake, but that he affirmeth this only of the women: where he writeth that the Britans wiues and women did vse to besmere all their body ouer with <HI>glastum,</HI> (woad, an hearb like plantaine) and to go starke naked to some certaine solemnities, when they were to performe some rites and ceremonies: in this imitating the Blackamoores. (But why I should not reteine the ancient reading, which in <HI>Caesar</HI> was <HI>glasto:</HI> for that which now they would haue <HI>luteo;</HI> I see no reason: seeing that out of a fr gment of a de∣scription of <HI>Britaine,</HI> done by my good friend M. <HI>Humfrey Lhoyd,</HI> I vnderstand, that amongst the West Britans in the ancient Brittish tongue, which they still speake euen to this very day, by the word <HI>glas,</HI> they vnderstand the blew or skie-colour, as also by the same they signifie the hearb <HI>Isatis,</HI> th t is, woad) which is very like the plantaine.) And that the men also did not onlie staine their bodies with some kind of colour, but also to marke them with diuers kinds of pictures, and counterfeits of sundrie sorts of liuing creatures, and to go naked, least they should hide this their painting, I read in <HI>Herodian.</HI> Listen, thou shalt heare <HI>Solinus</HI> speake the same wordes: The countrie is partly possessed by a barbarous and wild people, which euen from their childhood, haue by certaine cutters, men skilfull that way, diuers images and pictures of liuing creatures, drawen and raised vpon their skinne, and so imprinted in their flesh, that as they
<PB REF="263"/> grow vnto mans estate these pictures together with the painters staines, do wax bigger and bigger: neither doth the wild people endure any thing more patient∣ly and willingly, than that their limbes by meanes of those deep cuts and slashes, may so deepely drinke in these coloures, that they may sticke long by them. A∣mongst the Goddesses, as I learne by <HI>Dion,</HI> they worshipped <HI>Andates;</HI> (for so they call <HI>Victoriam,</HI> victory) who had a temple and sacred wood, where they vsed to do sacrifice, and performe their religious seruice and worship to her. Beside her they had another which was called <HI>Adraste:</HI> whether this were the same with <HI>Adrastia</HI> (which some did take to be <HI>Nemesis,</HI> the Goddesse of reuenge) which the ancient Grecians &amp; Romans did worship, I leaue to others to determin. <HI>Caesar</HI> saith, that in former times the <HI>Druides,</HI> a kind of superstitious priests, dwelt also amongst this people: who affirmeth, that their discipline and religion was first heere inuented, and from hence caried beyond sea into <HI>France.</HI> That they continued vntill the time of <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>Mona</HI> or <HI>Anglesey,</HI> it is apparent out of the <HI>14</HI> booke of <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> his Annals. Frō them, doubtlesse, this nation had their knowledge of the state &amp; immor∣tality of the soule after this life: for this was the opinion of those <HI>Druides,</HI> as <HI>Caesar</HI> and others haue written of them. But of the <HI>Druides,</HI> we will, God willing, speake more in our <HI>Old France,</HI> or <HI>Gallia</HI> as it stood in <HI>Caesars</HI> time. That the Britans did so greatly esteeme and wonderfully extoll the art Magicke, and performe it with such strange ceremonies, that it is to be thought that the Persians had it from hence, I haue <HI>Pliny</HI> for my patron, who mightily perswadeth me. The forenamed <HI>Bunduica,</HI> also doth seeme to iustifie the same: who, as soone as she had ended her oration vnto her army, cast an hare out of her lappe, by that meanes to gesse what the issue of that iourney would be: which after that she was obserued to goe on forward, all the company iointly gaue a ioifull shout and ac∣clamation. To sacrifice and offer the blood of their captiues vpon their altars, and to seeke to know the will and pleasure of their Gods by the entrails of men, as the Romans did by the bowels of beasts, these people held it for a very lawfull thing. Thus farre <HI>Tacitus:</HI> and thus much of <HI>Albion:</HI> now it remaineth that we in like manner say somewhat of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>

Like as the <HI>Celtae,</HI> (whose language he proueth to be the same with this) for the same reason and of the same word, named Spaine, <HI>Iberia:</HI> which afterward the Greekes in their language interpreted <HI>Hesperia.</HI> In <HI>Festus Auienus,</HI> who wrote a booke intituled <HI>Orae maritimae,</HI> the sea coast; it is named <HI>INSVLA SACRA, The Holy Iland;</HI> who moreouer addeth that it is inhabited of the <HI>Hierni,</HI> that is, of the Irish-men. <HI>Isacius</HI> in his Commentaries vpon <HI>Lycophron,</HI> calleth it <HI>WEST BRITAINE: Plutarch</HI> in his booke which he wrote <HI>Of the face in the sphere of the Moone,</HI> calleth it <HI>OGVGIA:</HI> but why, we know not: yet read him, if you thinke it worth the while: you shall heare many an old wiues tale. The latter writers, as S. <HI>Isidore,</HI> and the reue∣rend <HI>Beda,</HI> our countriman, call it <HI>SCOTIA,</HI> of the <HI>Scottes</HI> which seated themselues in the West part of this ile, about the yeare of our Lord <HI>310.</HI> from whence within a very few yeares after, being called in by the Picts, they came into <HI>Brittane:</HI> and indeed <HI>Paulus Orosius, Beda</HI> and <HI>Egeinhardus,</HI> authors of good credit, wrote that it was inhabited of the <HI>Scots.</HI> It is in length from South to North <HI>400.</HI> miles; in breadth scarse <HI>200.</HI> The soile and temperature of the aire, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> affirmeth, is not much vnlike that of <HI>England.</HI> It breedeth no snake or serpent, nor any venemous creature: fowle and birds heere are not very plentifull, and as for bees, no man euer saw one in the whole country: yea if so be that any man shall strew dust, grauell or small stones brought from hence, amongst the hiues, the swarmes will presently forsake their combes, as <HI>Solinus</HI> writeth. (Yet we know by experience that this is all false: for such is the in∣finit number of bees in this country, that they are not only to be found heere in hiues and bee-gardens, but also abroad in the fields in hollow trees and holes of the ground.) The temperature of the aire (saith <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI>) is very vnkind and vnfit for the ripening of corne and graine: but the soile is so good for grasse, not only great and ranke, but also sweet and wholesome, that their heards and cattell do fill themselues in so short a time, that if they be not driuen out of the pasture, they will feed while they burst. <HI>Solinus</HI> affirmeth the same, but in fewer words. Furthermore he calleth it an inhumane and vnciuill country, by reason of the rude and harsh manners of the inhabitants. And <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> termeth the people a disordered and vnmannerly nation, lesse acquainted with any sort of vertue then any other people whatsoeuer: yet they may in some respect be said to be louers of vertue: in regard that they are very religious and deuout. <HI>Strabo</HI> saith, that they are more rusticall and vnciuill then the Britans: <HI>Solinus</HI> calleth it a mercilesse and warlike nation: <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that they are great eaters: <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> saith, they did vse to eat mans flesh: and <HI>Solinus</HI> he addeth, that those which are conquerers in warre, vse first to drinke the bloud of those which are slaine, and then with the same to besmere their face. Yea they do account it, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, for a commendable thing to eat the bodies of their parents when they be dead: and to lie men and women with one another openly, not regarding who stand and looke on: and that not only with o∣ther women, but also euen with their mothers, and owne sisters: accounting this for an indifferent thing, neither good nor bad, as <HI>Iulius Solinus Polyhistor</HI> writeth. Moreouer he affirmeth, that if a great bellied woman shalbe brought to bed of a sonne, she causeth the first meat which he eateth to be laid vpon his fathers sword, and so vpon the point of the sword she gently putteth it into the infants mouth: and with certaine heathenish vowes and praiers, she wisheth that he may neuer die but in the warres or vpon his enemies sword. They which would be more finer and gallant than others, do set out the handles and pommels of their swords with the teeth of certain sea-fish: for they are as white as any iuory: and the chief: delight of the men is in the brauery of their weapons. <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his Chronicle saith, that in this Iland <HI>Galba</HI> caused himselfe to be proclaimed Emperour: but it is a fault of the writer, who for <HI>Hiberia,</HI> wrote <HI>Hibernia:</HI> for that this was done in <HI>Spaine.</HI> Thus farre of these two greater Ilands, which were properly called <HI>Britannicae:</HI> now let vs go on with those which are les∣ser, and do lie about the coast of these.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He <HI>ORKNEY ILES (Orcades)</HI> lying vpon the North of <HI>Scotland</HI> are, as <HI>Ptolemey</HI> and <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> doe account them, in number <HI>30.</HI> although <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Martianus</HI> maketh them to be two: <HI>Iornandes 33. S. Isidore</HI> very falsly <HI>83.</HI> and <HI>Solinus</HI> as farre short, reckoneth but <HI>3</HI> only: (peraduenture for <HI>tres,</HI> three: we should read <HI>triginta,</HI> thirty) <HI>M. Camden</HI> thinketh them to haue been so named of their situation ouer against <HI>Cath-nesse,</HI> that is, the promontory, foreland or cape of the <HI>Cathini,</HI> (not <HI>Careni,</HI> as the vulgar copies of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> haue) a nation that possessed this part of <HI>Britaine,</HI> in the time of the Romans: for thus he found it written and interpreted in an ancient manuscript, <HI>Argath;</HI> against <HI>Cath;</HI> (the copy hath <HI>supra Getas,</HI> aboue the Gothes, falsly: for they had not, till many yeares after this, seated themselues in any part of this ile: but peraduenture by the <HI>Getae,</HI> he vnderstood <HI>Cath,</HI> or the <HI>Cathini</HI> of <HI>Ptolemey</HI>) Of these, as many men report, diuers are desert and vnmanured, others are habitable and fertile. In <HI>Solinus</HI> time they were not inhabited, no man dwelt in them: for they had no wood, nor grasse, but were all ouergrowen with rushes, segges and such like: the rest, he saith, are nothing but bare rockes and heaps of sand: yet now they are reasonably populous, and doe yearely yeeld great store of <HI>Barly,</HI> mary they are wholy void of wood, and altogether vnprofitable for <HI>Wheat.</HI> They lie all close together not farre one from another, as <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Solinus</HI> iointly affirme. The same <HI>Solinus,</HI> as some learned men thinke, na∣meth <HI>POMONA</HI> for one of the Orkeny iles, and calleth it <HI>Pomona diutina,</HI> Long-daied Pomona; by reason of the great length of the day in this climat. In regard that it is farre greater than any of the rest, it is now vulgarly called <HI>MAIN-LAND.</HI> This is the principall and chiefe of them all, and hath in it, in the towne <HI>Kirkwale,</HI> a Bishops sea; and two castles for defence of the same. It yeeldeth yeerely some quantity of <HI>Tinne</HI> and <HI>Lead.</HI> Amongst these also <HI>Ptolemey</HI> nameth <HI>OCETIS</HI> and <HI>DVMNA,</HI> that we take to be now called <HI>Hethy,</HI> this <HI>Hey.</HI> (But that iland which <HI>Pliny</HI> nameth <HI>Dumna,</HI> seemeth to be that which at this day they call <HI>Faire ile,</HI> hauing but one towne and that called <HI>Dumo) Eutropis</HI> and <HI>Orosius</HI> haue deliuered, that <HI>Augustus</HI> the Emperour first annex∣ed these ilands vnto the Empire: yet <HI>Tacitus</HI> saith, that they were first descried and subdued by <HI>Iulius Agricola.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond the Orkney iles, aboue <HI>Britaine,</HI> fiue daies saile Northward (whereabout the old expositour of <HI>Horace</HI> placeth the <HI>Fortunate Iles</HI>) doth lie, as <HI>Solinus</HI> writeth, the iland <HI>THVLE,</HI> so famous and much spoken of in all ancient writers: but where it should now be, or what, the world hath long doubted. Some take it to be <HI>Island,</HI> but that cannot be, for many weighty reasons, as diuers learned men haue proued. <HI>Synesius</HI> doubleth whether there were any such place or not: and our <HI>Gyraldus</HI> plainly saith, that if euer it were, yet now it is no where in the world to be found. Some doe thinke it to be <HI>Shetland,</HI> (or as some call it <HI>Hetland</HI>) a greatter Iland beset with many other smaller, subiect to the crowne of <HI>Scotland:</HI> and this their opinion they confirme by many argu∣ments. First <HI>Gaspar Peucerus,</HI> an authour of good credit, affirmeth that the Seamen do commonly call this iland, <HI>Thylensell:</HI> Secondarily, they are situ∣ate midway betweene <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> where <HI>Saxo Grammaticus</HI> placeth <HI>Thule:</HI> Thirdly, these ilands are directly opposite to <HI>Bergen (Bergae,</HI> not <HI>Belgae,</HI> as it is falsly and corruptly written: and indeed heereabout <HI>Pliny</HI> his <HI>Bergos,</HI> was seated) and heere <HI>Mela</HI> saith <HI>Thule</HI> did stand: Againe, <HI>So∣linus</HI> writeth that from <HI>Cath-nesse</HI> to <HI>Thule,</HI> it is but two daies saile: (obserue the proportion of distances: from the Orkney to the West iles he maketh it <HI>7.</HI> daies saile: from <HI>Orkney</HI> to <HI>Thule, 5:</HI> and from <HI>Cath-nesse</HI> thither, but <HI>2.</HI>) Lastly, which were sufficient of it selfe alone, <HI>Ptolemey</HI> placeth <HI>Thule</HI> vnder the <HI>63.</HI> degree of latitude, which is precisely the eleuation of the North pole at <HI>Shetland.</HI> Thus farre of <HI>Thule</HI> or <HI>Shetland,</HI> which was not indeed ordinarily, of the ancients, accounted amongst the British, yet we now know it to be one of that number, &amp; subiect to the crown of <HI>Brittain.</HI> The <HI>WESTERN ILES,</HI> (called of <HI>Ptolemey, Solinus, Stephanus</HI> and <HI>Pliny, Ebudae, Aebudae</HI> or <HI>Hebudes:</HI> of the latter writers, <HI>Hebrides:</HI> of <HI>Ethicus, Beteoricae</HI>) are, as <HI>Solinus</HI> writeth, <HI>7</HI> daies saile from the Orchades. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith there be in number <HI>30.</HI> yet vulgarly they are esteemed to be <HI>44.</HI> and a Scottish gentleman, who
<PB REF="264"/> trauelled them al ouer, as he affirmeth, reckoneth vp by their seuerall names, as far as I remember, aboue <HI>200. Solinus, Stephanus</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey</HI> do name but these <HI>5.</HI> neither do they mention any more. <HI>RICINA</HI> or <HI>Ricnea,</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth it, <HI>Antonius</HI> nameth <HI>Raduna,</HI> now they call it <HI>Racline: EPIDIVM,</HI> now <HI>Ila,</HI> a large iland, &amp; a fertile champion soile: <HI>MALEOS,</HI> now <HI>Mula,</HI> as also in <HI>Plinies</HI> time, as it seemeth: <HI>EAST EBVDA,</HI> now <HI>Skie,</HI> lying close to the coast of <HI>Scotland: WEST EBVDA, (Lewes)</HI> the greatest of them al, but ful of stones, craggie steep mountaines, and little inhabited. Moreouer in <HI>Iona,</HI> which <HI>Beda</HI> nameth <HI>Hy,</HI> lying between <HI>Ila</HI> and the maine land, was a monastery erected by <HI>S Columba,</HI> where diuers of the kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> haue been buried: beside the bishops sea, in the village <HI>Sodore,</HI> in whose diocesses all the rest were, and therefore were of it called <HI>Insulae Sodorenses.</HI> All the other, beside <HI>Hirth,</HI> are of small account, as being nothing but rocks, stones, and craggie knols, in which you shall scarce all the yere long finde a greene turffe. The people, in maners, behauiour, apparell and language, do much resemble the Irish: as those in the Orkney doe the Goths and Norweyans. More of these see in <HI>Solinus</HI> and <HI>M. Camdens Britannia,</HI> to whom we are beholding for this.</P>
<P>The <HI>ILE of MAN,</HI> (which <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth <HI>Monabia; Orosius</HI> and <HI>Bede, Menauia; Gildas, Eubonia;</HI> the Welch, <HI>Menaw;</HI> they themselues, <HI>Maning; Caesar, Mona:</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey, Monoëda;</HI> that is, as who say, <HI>Mon-eitha, Mon</HI> the father; for a distinction from <HI>Anglesey,</HI> which is also called <HI>Mon</HI>) is midway between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as <HI>Caesar</HI> in his fifth booke of the warres of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Gyraldus Cambrensis</HI> report: yet the people are more like in language and maners vnto the Irish men. It is in length from South to North, about <HI>30.</HI> miles, in breadth in some places it is <HI>15.</HI> &amp; in other places, where it is narrowest, not aboue <HI>7</HI> or <HI>8</HI> miles ouer. In <HI>Bedaes</HI> time it had but <HI>300.</HI> families or housholds, now it conteineth <HI>17. parishes</HI> very populous and well inhabited. It beareth great plenty of <HI>Hempe</HI> and <HI>Flax.</HI> The soile is reasonably fertile, either for <HI>Corne</HI> or <HI>Grasse:</HI> and therefore it yeerely yeeldeth both great plenty of <HI>Barly, Wheat</HI> and <HI>Rie,</HI> but especially of <HI>Oats,</HI> whereof they for the most part, make their bread, &amp; maintaineth great store of <HI>cattel,</HI> and many flocks of <HI>sheepe,</HI> but that aswell the one as the other are lesse than they be in <HI>England.</HI> They burne Seacole, insteed of wood, of which they haue none or very little. Vpon the South coast lieth a small ile, which they call <HI>The calfe of Man,</HI> where there is such wonderfull plenty of sea fowles, which they call <HI>Puffins,</HI> and of those geese, which we call <HI>Bernacles, Clakes</HI> or <HI>Soland geese,</HI> as none which haue not seene them, will easily beleeue. Thus farre of <HI>Mona,</HI> described by <HI>Caesar;</HI> the o∣ther <HI>Mona,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Dion</HI> do speake of, now followeth.</P>
<P>That which we now call <HI>ANGLESEY</HI> that is, <HI>The English ile, Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Dion,</HI> as I said, called <HI>Mona:</HI> the Welchmen, <HI>Mon, Tir-mon,</HI> &amp; <HI>Inis Dowyl,</HI> that is, <HI>The darke ile;</HI> the Saxons, <HI>Monege:</HI> a very goodly and fruitfull iland, the ancient seat of the Druides, was brought in subiection vnder the Romane Empire, by <HI>Paullinus Suetonius</HI> and <HI>Iulius Agricola,</HI> about <HI>46.</HI> yeeres after the birth of Christ. It is very neere the coast of <HI>Britaine,</HI> as <HI>Dion</HI> saith: yea so neere that from the main, by swimming ouer the flattes and shallow places, <HI>Iulius Agricola,</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> witnesseth, conueied in thither both horsemen and foot∣men, to suppresse certaine rebels that held it against the Romans. But of this iland there is in this our Theater, a whole discourse written by <HI>Humfrey Lloyd,</HI> a learned gentleman, &amp; painfull student in the British stories. Vpon the coast of <HI>Wales</HI> also lieth <HI>BERDSEY,</HI> that is, <HI>The birds Ile,</HI> called of the Britans <HI>Enhly:</HI> of <HI>Ptolemey, Edry;</HI> of <HI>Pliny, Andros</HI> or <HI>Adros:</HI> a plaine and champion country toward the West, but in the East very hillie and mountainous. Then <HI>GRES∣HOLME,</HI> and <HI>STOCHOLME</HI> excellent pastorage, passing pleasant by reason of the sweet smell of the wild Tyme which heere groweth euery where in great abun∣dance. Next to these is <HI>SCALMEY,</HI> as fertile as any, called of <HI>Pliny, Silimnus:</HI> of <HI>Ptolemey, Limi:</HI> and in the catalogue of Martyrs, <HI>Lemeneia Insula.</HI> In the mouth of <HI>Seuern,</HI> lie the <HI>Holmes,</HI> or as the Welchmen call them, the <HI>Echni, FLATHOLME</HI> and <HI>STEEPHOLME (Reoric,</HI> in Welch) <HI>Item, BARREY, SILEY, CALDEY</HI> and <HI>LONDEY,</HI> small Ilands, but very fertile. Thirty or forty miles off West from the Cape of <HI>Cornewall,</HI> which the seamen commonly call, The lands end, lie the <HI>SORLINGS</HI> or the <HI>SYLLY;</HI> called by <HI>Sulpitius Seuerus, Sillinae;</HI> of <HI>Antonine, Sigdeles:</HI> of <HI>Solinus, Silurae,</HI> or <HI>Silurum Insulae:</HI> the Grecians, of their situation, named them <HI>Hesperides,</HI> the West iles: and of their rich commoditie of Tinne <HI>(Cassiteros)</HI> which they yeeld, <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> the Stanneries: but why <HI>Festus Auianus</HI> should name them <HI>Ostrimnides,</HI> I know not. They are in all <HI>145.</HI> beside craggie rockes which are innumerable. There are <HI>10.</HI> of them, which also <HI>Eustathius</HI> doth testifie: <HI>S. Mary, Annoth, Agnes, Sampson, Silly, Brefer, Rusco,</HI> (or <HI>Triscraw) S. Hellen, S. Martine</HI> and <HI>Arthur,</HI> with <HI>Minanwitham,</HI> and <HI>Minuisisand,</HI> greater and more famous then the rest for their rich veines of Tinne: from whence, as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, <HI>Medacritus</HI> first brought <HI>Lead</HI> or <HI>Tinne</HI> into <HI>Greece.</HI> Many of them are good <HI>corne ground:</HI> all of them infinite store of <HI>Conies, Cranes, Swannes, Herons,</HI> and other <HI>Sea-fowle.</HI> These are those ilands as <HI>Solinus</HI> writeth which a tempestuous frith, of two or three houres saile ouer, doth part from the outmost end of <HI>Corn∣wall (Danmoniorum ora)</HI> whose inhabitants doe still obserue the ancient customes: they keepe no faires or markets: they care not for mony: they giue and receiue such as one another haue neede of: they rather regard more to get necessary things for exchange, than those of high price and great valew: they are ve∣ry deuout in their religious seruices to their Gods: and both women and men in like manner do hold themselues to be very skilfull in foretelling of things to come.</P>
<P>Vpon the coast of <HI>France,</HI> ouer against <HI>Normandy,</HI> are <HI>GERSEY (Caesarea, Antoninus</HI> calleth it) a fertile soile, good corne ground, and reasonable pastorage: it hath <HI>12.</HI> parishes, wel inhabited and very populous: <HI>Item, GARNSEY, SERKE, ALDERNEY, ARME,</HI> the <HI>QVASQVETS</HI> and others, which although the ancients did neuer reckon amongst the number of the Brittish iles, yet we know that they are now subiect to the crowne of <HI>England,</HI> and euer haue beene since the yere of our Lord <HI>1108.</HI> at what time they were by <HI>Henry</HI> the first, annexed to this kingdome. They are all in the diocesse and iurisdiction of the Bishop of <HI>Winchester.</HI></P>
<P>Close to the shore of <HI>England</HI> is the ile of <HI>WIGHT, (Ptolemey</HI> calleth it <HI>Wictesis; Pliny</HI> &amp; <HI>Suetonius, Vectis;</HI> the <HI>Panegyricus</HI> &amp; <HI>Eutropius, Vecta; Diodorus, Icta,</HI> all deriued from the Brittish word <HI>Guith,</HI> which signifieth a deuision, or separation; for that it was once ioined, as then they vulgarly held, vnto the maine land: like as <HI>Sicilia</HI> was to <HI>Italy.</HI>) It is <HI>20.</HI> miles long, &amp; <HI>12.</HI> miles broad. <HI>Vespasian</HI> first brought it vnder the obedience of the Romans, in the raigne of the emperor <HI>Claudius,</HI> as <HI>Suetonius</HI> writeth in the fourth chapter of his <HI>Vespasianus:</HI> yet <HI>Eutropius</HI> affirmeth it to be done by <HI>Maximianus</HI> the emperor. It is by the sea, which entreth vp high within the land, diuided into two prouinces: <HI>Fresh-water ile</HI> and <HI>Binbridge ile.</HI> In <HI>Bedaes</HI> time it conteined but <HI>1200.</HI> families, now it hath <HI>36.</HI> parishes, villages &amp; castles, which do belong all to <HI>Hantshire,</HI> and are of the diocesse <HI>Winchester.</HI> The soile is very fertile either for corne or cattel. Beside many flocks of sheep of passing fine wool, it is wonderfully stored with <HI>Conies, Hares, Patridges</HI> &amp; <HI>Phesants.</HI> In the time of <HI>William</HI> the first, <HI>William Fitz-osbern</HI> was intituled <HI>Lord of Wight,</HI> and after that <HI>Henry Beauchamp</HI> Earle of <HI>Warwick,</HI> was by King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, crowned <HI>King of Wight.</HI> See more of it in <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> and <HI>Beda.</HI></P>
<P>The ile <HI>TENET,</HI> lying hard to the coast of <HI>Kent,</HI> of eight miles length, &amp; fower miles breadth, is a chalkie soile, and passing good corne ground. <HI>Solinus</HI> calleth it <HI>Thanatos,</HI> or as some copies haue, <HI>Athanatos,</HI> &amp; thus he writeth of it: The ile <HI>Thanatos (Tenit)</HI> washed by the French ocean: &amp; disioined from <HI>England,</HI> the main continent, by a narrow frith, is a very rich corne ground &amp; fat soile: neither is it only good and kind to it selfe, but also to other places: for as in it no snake or venemous serpents do breed or liue, so the earth &amp; dust, caried from thence, to what place of the world soeuer, doth naturally kill such vermine: Thus far <HI>Soli∣nus</HI> then: but that which he spake of it concerning Serpents, we now in our daies know by experience to be false. Neere to this is that shallow sandy place, so dangerous to sea-men, commonly called <HI>GOODVVINS SANDS,</HI> an iland sometime the possession of Earle <HI>Goodwin,</HI> which as our histories report, did sinke in the yeere of our Lord <HI>1097.</HI> This should seeme to be <HI>Toliapis,</HI> of <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> but that he placeth it neere to Essex or the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> when as this lieth a great deale more neere the <HI>Cantij.</HI></P>
<P>Within the Thames mouth are yet other two ilands, one vpon Kent side, which now we call <HI>SHEPEY,</HI> that is, <HI>the ile of sheep,</HI> but how it was called of the an∣cients we certainly know not: The other vpon Essex side, which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in his time called <HI>CAVNA, CONVENNOS</HI> or <HI>COVNOS</HI> (such is the variety of copies) is still called <HI>Conway.</HI> It lieth so flat and low that it is sometime all ouerflowen, excepting some little knols and hils whither the cattle do ordinarily flie in such like danger. It feedeth yerely four thousand sheepe at the least, whose flesh is of a most sweet and pleasant taste surpassing those of other places. Thus hauing pas∣sed so many troublesome and dangerous seas, and now being come within kenning of mine owne natiue country, I thinke it not amisse to put into harbrough heere for awhile, to rest our wearied limmes, and purge vs from those brackish humours which in this tedious iourney we drunke in. Thus farre then of the ilands described and named in this Mappe. Yet there are certaine others mentioned in some authours of good note. And <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the life of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> giueth out, that there are many ilands neere to <HI>Britain,</HI> waste and desert: whereof some, he saith, are dedicated to the gods and famous worthies. Amongst these there is one, in which he saith, they report, <HI>Saturne</HI> lulled a sleepe by <HI>Briareus,</HI> is kept as prisoner in chaines: he is bound, I say, with sleep in sted of a chaine: and hath many Angels and demy-gods for seruants to wait and attend vpon him. Whether this be that which that <HI>Auienus</HI> calleth <HI>Pelagia,</HI> and affirmeth to be conse∣crated to <HI>Saturne,</HI> I dare neither constantly affirme, nor peremptorily deny. Moreouer, of these same thou maist read something worth the while as not altoge∣ther vnpleasant, though doubtlesse meerly fabulous, in the same <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his booke intituled <HI>De defectu Oraculorum,</HI> of the ceasing of oracles: as also in <HI>Isacius Tzetzes,</HI> vpon <HI>Lycophron. Artimedorus</HI> in <HI>Straboes</HI> Geography saith, that there is an iland neere <HI>Britaine,</HI> where they offer sacrifice to <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Proserpina,</HI> in the selfe same manner and with like ceremonies, as they do in <HI>Samothrace. Apollonius,</HI> in his History of strange and wonderfull things, affir∣meth out of <HI>Cytinus Chius,</HI> that there is a certaine Brittish ile (not <HI>Britaine</HI> it selfe, as <HI>M. Camden</HI> vnderstandeth him) <HI>400.</HI> furlongs in compasse, where fruits doe grow without stones or kernels: for you shall neither find a stone in the oliue, nor kirnell in the grape: which also happeneth not only to these <HI>2</HI> fruites, but also to all other of those kinds. But this is more like a feigned tale, then a true story. Moreouer <HI>Dionysius Afer</HI> nameth the <HI>NESIADES,</HI> the seat and ha∣bitation of the <HI>Ammitae,</HI> amongst the number of the Brittish iles: but I would rather iudge these to be ilands vpon the coast of <HI>France,</HI> than Brittish iles, and that by the authority of <HI>Strabo.</HI> If any man do desire to know these better, let him repaire to the learned <HI>Claurencieux Camden,</HI> my singular good friend, who hath in that his <HI>Britannia,</HI> (a worthy worke composed by him, with infinte paines and trauell) so learnedly and diligently described and set downe their anci∣ent forme, customes, maners, places and cities, together with those of later times, and of these our daies, that they rather seeme to be expressed to the eie in their true colours, by the pencill of a skilfull painter, then by the pen of a painfull student. But some man may say, this is written in the Latine tongue, a language that I vnderstand not. Be patient a while.

<HEAD>SPAINE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His is that warlike Spain, famous I mean, for worthy men &amp; braue souldiers, as Florus speaketh of it, the first country of the maine continent of Europe vpon the West, inuironed round about with the salt sea, but only on that part where it bor∣dereth vpon France, from which it is seuered by the Pyreney mountaines, as it were by a naturall wall or rampart. Some there are which do thinke that it was first called <HI>IBERIA;</HI> of the riuer <HI>Iberus,</HI> or, as others would haue it of a king of this country of that name. Auienus deemeth it to haue beene so named of <HI>Ibera,</HI> (of which you may read in Liuy) a city of the prouince Betica, situate vpon the riuer <HI>Iberus,</HI> different from that other of the same name in Hispania Tarraco∣nensis. But I could more easily be drawen to thinke that both this country and the riuer did take their name of <HI>Iberia,</HI> a country in Asia, from whence this people first came and had their originall, where also there is a riuer called <HI>Iberus,</HI> as Pliny testifieth. That it was also called <HI>HESPERIA,</HI> of king <HI>Hesperus,</HI> beside the great Poet Virgil, Honorius and the faigned Berosus, farre latter writers, would faine make me beleeue. But truth will easily enforce any wise man to be∣leeue, that it rather tooke that name of <HI>Hesperus,</HI> which in Greeke signifieth the West, or the Euening stare: for indeed Spaine, of all the maineland of the whole world, as farre as the auncients knew, lieth farthest into the West. And therupon Horace nameth it <HI>Hesperia vltima,</HI> The farther Hesperia, to make a distinction betweene this and that other Hesperia, I meane Italie, which Virgil calleth <HI>Hesperia magna,</HI> The great Hesperia. For as the Greeks haue called this country Hesperia, by reason of the situation, being indeed from them Westward, so the Italians for the same cause haue intituled Spaine, which lieth betweene them and the West, by the same name. But at last it was generally of all sorts of writers in both languages famoused by the name of <HI>HISPANIA,</HI> and that of one <HI>Hispanus,</HI> except Trogus Pompeius be deceiued. Whether it hath sometime beene called <HI>PANNONIA,</HI> as Stephanus, in his booke of cities, hath giuen out, I am not able to say. That it was once knowen by the name of <HI>PANIA,</HI> it see∣meth to be probable out of the first chapter of the third booke of Pliny his Naturall history. Where he saith that <HI>Lusa</HI> gaue the name and appellation to that part of Spaine which was called <HI>Lusitania:</HI> (now Portugall) and <HI>Pan,</HI> who was sometime gouernour of that country, caused the whole to be denominated after his name. Of this opinion also is Sosthenes, cited by Plutarch, in his third booke of the historie of Iberia; where he writeth that this country of Pan, was first named Pania, but afterward of succedent ages it was corruptly called <HI>SPANIA.</HI> S. Hierome, vpon the sixtie and fourth chapter of the Prophet Esay calleth it Spania, and that the Chaldaeans did call it <HI>Spamia,</HI> (peraduenture for Spania) Benedictus Arias Montanus, a man worthy of eternall fame, in his Commentaries vpon Obadiah, doth plainly testifie. And some there are, which, in the <HI>28.</HI> verse of the fifteenth chapter of Saint Paul vnto the Romanes, for <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, do read <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as you may see by the edition of Henry Steeuen, and the Syrian copie which Raphalengius vsed: although some impressions of Plantine, and that of Albert Widmanstade haue the contrary. For <HI>Hispania,</HI> as commonly it is read in the printed copies of Trogus, in the manuscripts I do find <HI>Spania.</HI> And so the best and most ancient copies of Quintus Curtius haue, as the singular learned Bongarsius hath noted. Thus also the name of this country was alwaies wont to be written aboue seuen hundred yeares since, as the worthy gentleman Ambrosius Moralis, a man of great credit, and a most diligent searcher out of Spanish antiquities, in more then one or two places in his Commentaries vpon the Eulogium, doth teach vs. An ancient Glossary vpon the Poet Iunenall saith, that <HI>Tagus est fluuius Spaniae,</HI> that is, Tagus is a riuer of Spaine. In an ancient Greeke Lexicon set out by Henry Steeuen, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is put for <HI>Hibera,</HI> and <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for <HI>Hispania.</HI> Galen, the prince of Physicians in the fourth chapter of his sixth booke of Simples, writeth that there is an oile brought out of Iberia <HI>(Spaine)</HI> called amongst the Apothecaries <HI>Oleum Spanum, i. Hispanum,</HI> that is, Spanish oile. In a little manuscript treatise of the Prouinces belonging to the Romane Empire, I found <HI>Spania,</HI> in that very place where Schonhouius, who first set this booke out in Print, hath <HI>Hispania.</HI> The inhabitants of this country, which to this day do name it <HI>Espan̄a,</HI> or <HI>Spania,</HI> do confirme this writing. For Espan̄a and Spania do differ only in maner of writing, not in sound or pronunciation. For the Spaniards vsually do put E before any Latine words which do begin with S, and so make the Spanish. Examples heereof thou maist find in our Thesaurus, at the word <HI>Iberia.</HI> Moreouer it was sometime called <HI>CELTIBERIA,</HI> as Appian and others do testifie. Heerehence it is that the people of this country were anciently called <HI>Celtiberi</HI> and <HI>Celtoscythae,</HI> and also <HI>Iglerae,</HI> as Strabo the worthy Geographer hath left recorded. Of the Iewes it is called <HI>SEPHARAD,</HI> as the forenamed Montanus, and William Postell do teach vs. But of the name and appellation let this suffice: it remaineth now that in like maner we speake somewhat of the countrie it selfe. Di∣onysius Afer and Strabo do affirme that this country is in forme like vnto an Ox hide: Trogus saith that it is square: Aethicus, an authour of small cre∣dit, in my iudgement, maketh it Three-cornered. In the decree of Constantine, which Ioseph Scaliger hath set out with Ausonius, it is graced with the title of <HI>Speciosa,</HI> The beautifull. Stephanus diuideth it into the <HI>GREATER,</HI> and the <HI>LESSER.</HI> And an ancient inscription maketh mention of Spaine the <HI>LOVVER (Inferior.)</HI> Learned antiquity did diuide it into <HI>CITERIOREM</HI> and <HI>VLTERIOREM,</HI> or <HI>EXTERIOREM,</HI> The Hi∣ther and the Further or Outter Spaine. Since that certaine yeares, it was distinguished into three prouinces, called by other different names. For that which they called Citerior, was by them named <HI>TARRACONENSIS;</HI> that part of the Vlterior which lieth Westward, <HI>LVSITANIA;</HI> and the o∣ther which declineth toward the South, <HI>BAETICA.</HI> Afterward in the time of the Romane Emperours it was diuided into six shires or prouinces, whose names out of Sextus Rufus are these: <HI>TARRACONENSIS, CARTHAGINENSIS, LVSITANIA, GALLICIA, BAETICA,</HI> and <HI>TRANSFRETANA,</HI> which otherwise also they called <HI>TINGITANA.</HI> Yet the Mappe sheweth that this latter prouince is no part of true Spaine, but a portion of Africa, beyond the streights. Moreouer to these the booke of Records addeth <HI>INSVLAREM</HI> or <HI>Balearium,</HI> The Baleares, Malorca and Menorca with other ilands in the Mediterran sea, belonging to this country. All Spaine, thus generally defined, was by the Romanes diuided into four∣teen Iurisdictions <HI>(conuentus iuridici;)</HI> For in Lusitania Pliny teacheth vs that there were three, to wit, <HI>EMERITENSIS, PACENSIS,</HI> and <HI>SCALABITANVS,</HI> and in them were fiue and forty townes: In Tarraconensis or Hither Spaine, there were these seuen, <HI>CARTHAGINENSIS, TARRACONENSIS, CAESAR AVGVSTANVS, CLVNIENSIS, ASTVRVS, LVCENSIS,</HI> and <HI>BRACARVS:</HI> in which there were <HI>294.</HI> townes. In Batica were these foure, <HI>GADITANVS, CORDVBENSIS, ASTIGITANVS</HI> and <HI>HISPALENSIS,</HI> and in them <HI>175.</HI> townes. So that the whole summe of all the townes in Spaine is <HI>514.</HI> And although Strabo doth seeme to make the number somewhat greater, yet hee thinketh that they do but cog, which say that in Spaine there be more then a thousand: and that they do account great villages for good townes: and with∣all he affirmeth that the country is not capable of many cities, by reason of the drinesse or barrennesse of the soile, and barbarous rudenesse of the people, ex∣cept it be only along by the coast of the midland sea. For the Spaniards for the most part are wild, and do dwell in villages. That Spaine is all ouer inhabi∣ted, one may perceiue by Pomponius; who saith, That it is wonderfully replenished with men. And Cicero, in a certaine oration of his, writeth, That the Romanes ouercame them not by multitudes, but by religion and policy. Pliny out of Varro teacheth vs, That they which inhabited this country were the <HI>IBERI, PHOENICIANS, PERSIANS, CELTAE</HI> and <HI>POENI.</HI> The same also is auerred by Appianus Alexandrinus. And I to those may well ioine the <HI>ROMANES,</HI> who questionlesse, after they had from hence driuen out the Poeni or Carthaginians, did seat themselues and plant their colo∣nies heere. But to speake a word or two of the nature, maners and customes of the inhabitants of this country, and to annex vnto the former, what I find noted of that matter in the writings of the best historians, for that I doubt not but it will be a matter both pleasant and pleasing vnto the Reader, I thinke it will not be amisse. Calpurnius Flaccus doth attribute vnto them <HI>flauam proceritatem,</HI> talnesse of body, but tawny complexions. Iulius Firmicus saith, that by reason of the elimate and constitution of the heauens there, The Spaniards are impudent proud braggards. Yet this he in the same place addeth, That this foule fault is well left of many of them. Florus saith, that the whole Nation generally is vnruly and will by no meanes be commanded or kept in any due obedience. Dionysius Afer calleth it <HI>Nationem magnanimem,</HI> A courageous people: Martiall the Poet, <HI>Trucem,</HI> Grimme: Oppianus, <HI>Su∣perbam,</HI> Proud: Tibullus, <HI>Audacem,</HI> Bold: Vopiscus, <HI>Astutam,</HI> Wilie: Trogus and Liuy, <HI>Feram &amp; bellicosam,</HI> Fierce and Warlike, and withall very actiue and nimble of body: men of vnquiet spirits, alwaies desirous of newes and alterations in states and common wealths: of nature more like to wild beasts, than ciuil men. Vegetius the warriour, saith that, They are lustier men of body and farre stronger than the Romanes. Virgil in his Georgickes calleth them <HI>Iberos impacatos,</HI> Turbulent Spaniards: for that, as Seruius interpreteth the word, they are ranke riders and great stealers of cattell: or for that, as Iunius Philargyrus vnderstandeth it, they hold robbing and burglary to be the best kind of life. Their bodies are fit for all maner of labour and hardship, of such stomackes that they will venture life and limme vpon the least cause that is, as Valerius Maximus and Trogus doe testifie: whereupon Silius Italicus writeth thus of them, <HI>Prodiga gens animi, &amp; properare facillima mortem, Namque vbi transcendit florentes viribus annos, Impatiens aeui, spernit nouisse senectam, Et fati modus in dextra est, &amp;c.</HI> A desperat nation Spaniards are, They care not for their bloud: Assoon as e're they come to grow'th, And yeares of mans estate, To liue vnto a doting age, They scorn't as thing not good: Therefore ech man will be the meanes To hasten on his fate &amp;c. They are so deuoted and addicted to their kings, as Seruius in his Commentaries vpon the fourth booke of Virgils Georgickes, citeth out of Salust, that They will desire to liue no longer then they do. To their enemies they are very cruell, but toward strangers passing humane and kind. For trauellers or forreners such as come to them, they do most curtuously entertaine: so that oft times they do one spite another and contend for that honour and credit, as Diodorus Siculus reporteth. Ptolemey in his Quadripartite writeth, That they are a very neat and cleanly people. This also is a∣uouched by Diodorus, yet he in this one thing misliketh them for this one slouenly and filthy tricke, to wit, for that they do ordinarily vse to wash their bo∣dies all ouer, and their teeth with vrine, taking it to be an excellent Physicke and preseruatiue for the body: yea and the same authour writeth that they do saue and keepe it in cesternes vntill it be stale for that purpose. Yet Strabo the learned Geographer ascribeth this to the Cantabri and their nere neigh∣bours onely. Catullus the Poet attributeth it as proper vnto the Celtiberi. Apuleius in his first Apologie which he wrot in his own defence, maketh men∣tion of the washing of their teeth. We read in Diodorus Siculus, that at their meales they eat lustily vpon sundry dishes, that they make their drink of hony,

<PB REF="266"/> and do buy all the wine they drinke. Yet peraduenture this is meant and to be vnderstood only of those which dwell vpon the coast of the Midland sea. For Flo∣rus and Pliny do write that they vsed ordinarily a kind of drinke made <HI>ex frumento soluto,</HI> of a kind of bread corne ground or beaten small, (which drinke of theirs Pliny calleth <HI>Caelia</HI> and <HI>Caeria</HI>) yea and of Barly too, as Dioscorides in the <HI>110.</HI> chapter of his second booke writeth. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. that is, Moreouer that kind of drinke which they call <HI>Curmy,</HI> made also of Barley, vsually drunke in some places in stead of wine, maketh the head ake, breedeth ill bloud and hurteth the nerues and sinewes. Such kind of drinkes also are made of wheat in the West part of Spaine and in England. Thus farre Dioscorides. This kind of drinke the Welchmen do euen to this day call <HI>Cwrw,</HI> by the same name very little or nothing altered, as we haue shewed before, and is that which the Saxons call <HI>Ale.</HI> Strabo affirmeth that the Lusitani or Portugals did drinke a kind of drinke which they called <HI>Zy∣thum,</HI> (made also of Barley but much different from Curmi, as the same Dioscorides at the same place teacheth) for they haue, saith he, small store of wine. And that little which they haue, they spend by and by in banquetting and making merry with their friends and kinsfolke. This their drinke made of steeped corne, as the forenamed Pliny in the <HI>22.</HI> chapter of his <HI>14.</HI> booke writeth, will endure to be kept long, and is the better for the age. For this cause it was perad∣uenture that Athenaeus in his Deipnosophiston, accounteth the Spaniards amongst those nations that will ordinarily be drunke. The same also doth Plato write of the Celtiberi. That they had but small store of wine in Straboes time, it is very probable, because that Vopiscus hath left recorded, that Probus the Empe∣rour was the first that euer gaue licence to the Spaniards to set and plant vines, and to make wine. Trogus saith that they be hard and very niggardly. And al∣though they be very wealthy, as Athenaeus testifieth, yet they will drinke water, liue sparingly, dine and suppe alone, that they may go braue and hang the more vpon their backs. Nay as Trogus affirmeth, vpon their greatest festiuall daies they neuer vsed to make any great preparation or extraordinary cheere. Dioscori∣des writeth that they vsed wild rocket seed in sted of mustard seed. Pliny writeth, That in his time they did account akorns &amp; mast for a dainty dish: and Strabo saith, that of the flower of them they did vsually make their houshould bread. And Pliny he affirmeth that this kind of bread was lighter than any other sort of bread, because they did leauen it. That they did vse to lie vpon the bare ground, the same Pliny doth testifie. They did weare a short blacke garment, as Dio∣dorus Siculus writeth. Isidorus in the <HI>23.</HI> chapter of the <HI>19.</HI> booke of his <HI>Origines,</HI> nameth a certaine kind of garment, worne by the Spaniard, <HI>Striges.</HI> They had rather haue warres, than rest and peace. When they haue no enemy abroad, they seeke for him at home, if one may beleeue Trogus the Historiographer. In warre not only the horsemen, but also the footmen, are farre stronger, harder, and able to endure any manner of labour and paines then any other nation what∣soeuer. They giue the onset and beginne the battell with songs and poeticall rymes, as the same authour with Silius Italicus doth testifie; <HI>Ritu iam moris Ibe∣ri Carmina pulsata fundentem barbara cetra,</HI> Then like as Spaniards vse, In stead of drumme they targets sounds, And warlike songs do tune. And lea∣ning or resting themselues vpon two swords, hauing beaten and disordered the enemies horsemen, they light off from their horses, and doe adioine themselues to their footmen: which very same thing Suidas speaketh of the Celtiberi. These swords, as it is apparant out of Liuy and Polybius, by reason of their shortnesse were very nimble, and more fit for close fight: they had also sharpe points, so that in sight they did rather vse foines and thrusts, then downe right blowes. Not∣withstanding Suidas in that commendeth the excellency of the swords vsed by the Celtiberi, that their fight is hot and desperate and that they will abide a mighty stroke with both the hands. Athenaeus also sheweth that they in fight vsed the French weapon called <HI>Gesum,</HI> where he telleth vs that the Romanes v∣sed to fight with that kind of weapon, and learned to handle it of the Spaniards. And they, as it is very probable out of Iulius Pollux, tooke it of the Africanes, for he calleth it <HI>Gaesam Lybicam,</HI> and termeth it an iron speare or partisan. They weare head-pieces made of brasse. Their legges they wrappe vp in a kind of bootes made of haire, as Diodorus Siculus testifieth. Strabo, the great Cosmographer, writeth, That in battell they vse to beare a light kind of armour, targets, darts, and slings. They did fight, as Polybius saith, being apparelled in linnen garments garded or laid about with a purple welt, and in long side coates as white as the drift snow. And although they did weare tragicall robes or gownes, and were clad with many coates, and those, when they went abroad, hanging downe to their feet, yet, as Athenaeus testifieth, they were not by that meanes one whit the more vnwealdy in fight, cowardlike, or lesse valiant and courageous. This was their armour and warlike habite. But this one thing, which you shall find in the <HI>7.</HI> booke of Aristotles Politickes, I do thinke may not be omitted, to wit, that he there recordeth that so many columnes or pillars were wont to be pitched vp about the graues or sepulchres of the dead, as they had killed enemies. Nor this of Silius Italicus in his <HI>13.</HI> booke may be forgotten, <HI>Tellure, vt perhibent, is mos antiquus, Ibera Exanima obscoenus consumit corpora vultur,</HI> vpland, they say, an ancient custome t'is, That carren crowes and rauening kite should pray and quite consume the flesh Of Spaniards braue departed hence. Yet Aeli∣anus affirmeth this peculiarly of the Barcaei, and that of those only which did die in the field or were slaine in the warres: but those which died in their beds, of any naturall sicknesse, were as he saith burnt to ashes. Caesar writeth that they are all by nature giuen to swimming, and to practise to swimme ouer deepe and broad riuers, and that it is a thing generally so common amongst them, that no man will heere goe into the field or campe without his bladders or water bouget seruing to that purpose. In the fragments of Salust I read that it was their maner, that when yong men were first trained, and were to go to the warres, their mothers did recite vnto them all the valiant acts of their ancestours. Trogus affirmeth, That many of them did more esteeme of their armour, and great horses which had serued in the warres, then they did of their owne liues. They were wont also, as Strabo teacheth vs, to prepare for themselues <HI>Toxicum,</HI> that is, a kind of confection that killeth a man without any maner of griefe or paine. This they made of a certaine herb like to smallage, <HI>(apium)</HI> that they might haue it al∣waies by them in a readinesse, what crosse luck or misfortune soeuer should betide them. Florus saith that they do for this purpose draw a certaine poison out of the yewgh-tree <HI>(taxus.)</HI> Pliny also speaketh of this custome of theirs, but he saith that they make it of the berries of the yewgh-tre. And thus much hitherto of the nation in generall: now a word or two of some of them particularly. The <HI>LVSITANI</HI> or <HI>Portugals</HI> were more valiant and better souldiers than the rest, but they were very infamous for pilfering &amp; theeuery, they giue not thēselues to husbandry or tillage of the ground, they are not able fellowes for scowts &amp; ambushes, very nimble, light and quicke of retraict. For their drinke they did vse <HI>Zythum,</HI> as we said before. <HI>Butter</HI> doth serue their turne in stead of oile. Their di∣shes and such like vessels were made of wax. Their boates were made of leather, vntill the time of Brutus. Yet afterward they had hoies and such like ships of burden, as it is manifest out of Strabo, who doubteth not to equall the number and greatnesse of them with those of the Africanes. This also is iustified by Sidoni∣us, in his Panegyricke oration made to Maiorianus. Amongst this people, as Pliny reporteth, was the <HI>Carbassus,</HI> a kind of linnen for sailes of ships, first inuen∣ted. Such was the life of these Lusitaui. The <HI>CALAICI, ASTVRES,</HI> and <HI>CANTABRI,</HI> euen vp as high as the <HI>VASCONES</HI> and the Pyrenaean mountaines did liue much like the Lusitani, as Varro in his booke of Husbandry, Dion Cassius, Iosephus the Iew, and Strabo the great Cosmographer do testifie, in whom and in Diodorus Siculus thou maist read many other things of this people. Sextus Auienus calleth the inhabitants a churlish and rough people; Item, <HI>Gens ista dura, gens fera venatibus, Lustrisque inhaerens,</HI> This nation's hard and stout, All woodmen wild and giuen to hunt, and range the woods about. But of the <HI>CANTABRI,</HI> heare what Silius Italicus, the worthy Poet in his <HI>3.</HI> booke reporteth: <HI>Cantaber ante omnes hyemis{que} aestus{que} famis{que} Inuictus, palmam;{que} ex omni ferre labore. Mirus amor populo, cum pigra incanuit aetas Imbelles iamdudum annos praeuertere saxo: Nec vitam sine Mar∣te pati, quippe omnis in armis Lucis caussa sita, &amp; damnatum viuere paci.</HI> In effect thus much in English; The Cantaber can endure the chilling cold of winter, the heat of parching summer, hunger, labour or any maner of toile, better than any other nation of all Spaine. It is a strange thing to see how this people is delighted; assoone as euer they begin to grow in yeares and to be gray-headed, and so no longer fit for labour or any manner of seruice, they'll make an end of themselues. No man heere desireth to liue out of the warres, for euery one thinketh that he is borne for no other purpose, all generally condemning peace and the idle life. Strabo calleth the <HI>CELTIBEROS, togatos,</HI> peaceable men, and saith that they were sometime held to be the wildest and most barbarous and in∣humane people of all Europe, but now it is a populous and wealthy nation. The same Strabo deemeth the <HI>TVRDETANOS</HI> to haue beene the learnedst people of Spaine. For that they did vse the Grammar, and had certaine monuments of antiquity, recorded and kept amongst them in writing, and withall their lawes and statutes were written and preserued in verse, and certaine poeticall meeter. The same authour termeth the <HI>CARPETANOS, VACCAEOS, LA∣CETANOS,</HI> and <HI>CALLAICOS, nobiles gentes,</HI> noble and braue nations. But of these last I cannot but againe cite the words of the forenamed Silius, where he thus speaketh of them; —<HI>Misit diues Gallecia pubem, Barbara nunc patrijs vlulantem carmina linguis, Nunc pedis alterno percussa ver∣bere terra Ad numerum resonas gaudentem plaudere cetras. Haec requies, ludus{que} viris, ea sacra voluptas. Caetera femineus peragit pudor: ad∣dere sulco Semina, &amp; impresso tellurem vertere aratro. Segne viris quicquid duro sine Marte gerendum est. Callaici coniux obit irrequieta ma∣riti.</HI> And because that he speaketh heere also of the women, hearken what Trogus saith of them: The women, saith he, do manage all businesses at home and with∣in doores, they looke vnto the husbandrie and plowing of the ground: the men giue themselues wholly to follow the warres, to robbe and steale. The same doth Strabo report of them, who besides addeth that when they are deliuered of child, the husbands at their request shall keepe their beds, and they will scrue thcm. And while they are at work oft times they wash their litle ones, and making them ready, do lay them to sleepe vpon the brinke of some brooke or riuer. Once euery yeare they lay all their webs which they haue spunne in open sight to bee viewed of all men, and shee which in the iudgement of most men hath laboured hardest, beareth away the bell and greatest commendation, as Stobaeus, in the chapter of Temperance, out of one Nicolaus, hath left recorded. Amongst the Cantabri the husband giueth a dowry to the wife, and the daughters are made heires of their fathers lands and goods, and by them the brethren are bestowed in mariage. The fashion of the apparell and maner of attire of these women, is described by the same authour, as you may read in Artimedorus. The buildings and houses of this country were made, as we may vnderstand by Vitruuues, the famous Architect, of timber, roads, straw, reeds and leaues. Wals they haue which they call <HI>formaceos,</HI> or as some read <HI>fornaceos,</HI> for that being enclosed round in maner of a form on both sides with two boords, they were rather stuffed then workmanly built, as Pliny in the <HI>14.</HI> chapter of his <HI>13.</HI> booke doth testifie. Of the religion of the ancient Spaniards I find little obserued by any good authours: and that which is noted of that argument you shall find in Strabo: to wit, That the <HI>LVSITANI,</HI> did sacrifice a goat to Mars, and beside that, their prisoners taken in the warres, and their great horses. Item, That they vsed to diuine and foretell of things to come by the entrails of their captiues and prisoners. Item, That after the maner of the Greeks they held certaine solemne feasts which they call <HI>Hecatombas,</HI> wherein an hundred beasts were sacrificed at once. Item, Certaine ga∣mings, in maner of their Olympiackes. That they were not altogether vnskilfull of that kind of diuination, made by the obseruation of the entrails of beasts sacri∣ficed, called by the Romanes <HI>Aruspicina,</HI> we may see by that saying of Lampridius spoken of Alexander Seuerus, to wit, in that he saith, That he was more skil∣full in that art, than they. In Macrobius I find that the <HI>ACCITANI,</HI> did worship and do diuine honour vnto Mars, which they in their language call <HI>Necys.</HI> Some haue reported, That the <HI>CALLAICI</HI> had no maner of perceiuerance at all of any god. But the <HI>CELTIBERI,</HI> and their neere neighbours in the North
<PB REF="266"/> parts, did worship a certaine vnknowen god at night in the full moone, dancing and making merry, before the gates with all their families and housholds all nightlong. Yet it is apparant out of Pliny that in old time many yeares ago the <HI>Saguntim,</HI> did reuerence and diuine worship vnto Diana, brought thither by those of Zacynthus <HI>(Zante) 200.</HI> yeares before the destruction of Troy. Thus far of the nation. But that we may shew a little more plainly the nature and disposition of this people, I think it not amisse out of the best Historians to set downe some few other obseruations which we haue noted concerning this argument. At what time the <HI>VETTONES</HI> came first to be subiect to the command of the Romans, &amp; did obserue certain captains &amp; lieutenants for recreation sake to stray &amp; wander vp &amp; down the fields, they supposing them to be beside them∣selues, tooke them and led them home to their cottages or dwelling places. For they thought that either they were to sit still in peace at home, or else to fight it out. This was an argument of their simplicity. See the <HI>5.</HI> chapter of the <HI>2.</HI> book of Aelians <HI>de varia historia.</HI> In the wars between the Romans and the Cantabri, the mothers killed their owne children, left they should fall into the enemies hands. <HI>A</HI> child at the commandement of his father, with a sword killed his father, mother and brethren being taken cap∣tiues by the enemy. And againe, a woman in like maner killed her children and husband with others taken with her. One being called into the company of swaggering tosse-pot drunkards leapt into the fire and burnt himselfe. These were arguments of their great loue of liberty. Others of them, being taken in the field and nailed to the pillory, they report, did sing triumphantly as if they had gotten the victory. This was an argument of their contempt of death. Thus much out of Strabo: those which follow are taken out of Trogus. In the Punicke wars the patience of that seruant is highly commended, who reuenging his masters death, in the middest of all his torments did laugh hartily, and with a merry pleasant countenance did ouercome the cruell executioners. This is a notable example of true fortitude and valour. Oft times diuerse of them haue been tormented to death for that they would not bewray such things as were told them in secret: so that they made greater account of fidelity and secrecie, than of their liues. Many such examples as these, might, out of ancient authours, be referred to this place. But of the nature of this nation let these few things suffice. Now let vs addresse our selues to speake something of the country it selfe and nature of the soile. And first of the fertility of the same. Trogus maketh Spaine to be far more fertile than Africa or France. Being neither so much parched as that, with the heat of the Sunne; nor toiled as this, with continuall raging winds: but indifferent between them both: so that partly by reason of the temperature of the aire, and partly by reason of the moderate showres and raine which heere do fall, it is most fertile of all maner of corne and graine. For, as Philostratus hath left recorded, heere the temperature of the aire is such, as it is ordinarily in Autumne at Athens in Greece. Whereupon that in Solinus Polyhistor is trulie spoken of this country. This climate or tract of ground, for goodnesse, may iustly be compared to the best country in the world, it is in∣feriour to none whether you respect the great plenty of <HI>corne</HI> heere growing, and goodnesse of soile, or whether you respect the number of choice <HI>vines</HI> and <HI>fruit trees,</HI> which heere do naturally come vp of themselues, with the great commodity that ariseth of them. It aboundeth with all things, that are either richly prised and greatly esteemed, or found to be necessary for vse. <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Siluer</HI> if you will seeke for them, they are heere to be found: it neuer failed the <HI>Smithes:</HI> it giueth place to none for <HI>Vines;</HI> it excelleth any other country for store of the best <HI>Oiles.</HI> There is no place of it vacant ground, none barren and altogether vnfruitfull. What place soeuer it be through∣out this whole country that will not beare some kind of corn or other good fruit, that is good meddow or pasture. Yea euen those places that seem to be drie &amp; barren, do beare hempe or such stuffe seruing to make cables for ships. This is also confirmed by Pomponius Mela, in these words: It is, saith he, so fertile and well stored with <HI>men, horses, iron, lead, siluer</HI> and <HI>gold,</HI> that if there be any place of it, which by reason of want of water, be barren and not like it selfe, yet there it beareth <HI>Hempe, Flaxe,</HI> and a kind of shrubbe called <HI>Spartum,</HI> whereof they made cables for ships. Yet Strabo doth exempt from hence Tudetania, or Batica, who affirmeth that this place hath such wonderfull plenty of both, I mean of <HI>Mettal</HI> and of <HI>Corn,</HI> that it is impossible to giue it such due commendations as for the worthinesse of it it doth deserue. Nay it is so fertile of all these commodities, that as the same Trogus reporteth, it yeeldeth not sufficient for the vse of the inhabitants only, but besides that it serueth all Italy and the populous city of Rome. And thus much generally of the nature of the soile and commodities of this country. But Strabo doth somewhat more particularly handle this argument. For he sheweth that all the prouinces and shires of Spaine are not alike fertile and good: and those countries which haue greatest plenty of mines and mettall are good for lit∣tle else. A great part of it also is but meanly inhabited, by reason of the mountaines and woods, with spatious and wide champion barren fields, where the soard or earth is very little or none at all. Neither hath it in all places water inough to serue it, as about Carpentania or Celtiberia, and almost all the North part of it abuttant vpon the sea: which places are not very well inhabited by reason of the cragginesse of the mountaines and bleake coldnesse of the aire. This part beareth no maner of corn at all. (Per∣aduenture Iuuenal in his <HI>3.</HI> Satyre meant this tract, when he saith, <HI>Horrida vitanda est Hispania,</HI> Rough Spaine must carefully be shunned.) Yet the skirts of it where it bordereth vpon the Midland sea aboundeth with <HI>Oliues, Figges, Vines,</HI> and other such like plants and fruit trees, notwithstanding the vpland countries are not alto∣gether void and destitute of these commodities. So that I may not without good cause heere apply that saying of Silius Italicus, an authour so often by me cited and named: <HI>Nec Cereri terra indocilis, nec inhospita Baccho, Nullaque Palladia sese magis arbore tollit.</HI> Ceres heere hath taught her trade, God Bacchus heere was lodg'd: For choisest oiles and sigges as good, This country well may boast and bragge. In Lusitania also, that part especially which lieth between the riuer Tagus and the Ariabri, is a very good soile both for corne and grasse. Moreouer it yeeldeth great plenty of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Siluer,</HI> and such like things. Athenaeus, in the <HI>8.</HI> booke of his Deipnosophi∣ston confirmeth the same. Item, All that part of the country that lieth vpon the South, as Pliny testifieth, is very good: to wit, all that which they call Baetica is more popu∣lous, better manured, a richer soile, more fertile and pleasant than any other country of all Spaine. In this prouince the grasse is so wonderfully ranke, that except the cat∣tell be leazed and sometime brought home out of the pasture and restrained from feeding, they will burst themselues, as Trogus reporteth. But not only the land, but euen the sea which beateth vpon the coast of this Turdetania, is also as fertile: For it is wonderfully stored with all kind of <HI>Oisters, Shelfishes, Tunies</HI> and <HI>Purples,</HI> (a kind of shelfish whereof that colour is made) which are very gainfull vnto those that will labour to take them. And besides that, they do salt much of it and preserue it in pickle. Thus farre therefore of the vpper soard of the earth: Now let vs speake a word or two of the admirable rich mettals of this country, which lie hid vnder the same. That Spaine is all ouer bestrewed with <HI>Gold, Siluer, Iron, Lead, white</HI> and <HI>red,</HI> Pliny and Strabo do iointly testifie. Of the great plenty of <HI>gold</HI> and <HI>siluer</HI> heere found the Holy scripture in the <HI>8.</HI> chapter of the <HI>1.</HI> booke of the Machabees doth affirme. This also is auouched by Iosephus in the <HI>16.</HI> chapter of his <HI>2.</HI> booke of the Iewes wars. But it yeeldeth the greatest store in the driest and most barren mountaines, vpon which nothing else will grow or thriue. Yet by reason of the gold, as Pliny witnesseth, they are forced and made fruitfull. Such are those which do inclose Bastetania and Oretania, in which Strabo saith there are some veines of <HI>Gold ore.</HI> The same authour writeth, That in mount Argent, not farre from Castulon by Ilipa and both the Sisapoes there is a veine of <HI>siluer.</HI> Polybius saith that this veine runneth along by the city Babyla. In the confines of Milessia, where the city Oringis standeth, Liuy writeth that the inhabitants do find good store of <HI>siluer.</HI> Neere vnto the riuer Tagus also, in the moun∣taines are mines of <HI>mettall.</HI> At Cotinas are found both <HI>copper</HI> and <HI>gold,</HI> as the same Strabo testifieth. The prouince of Gallecia (this Trogus affirmeth) is wonderous full of <HI>copper</HI> and <HI>lead:</HI> it is also very rich of <HI>gold,</HI> so that oft times euen the plough doth turne vp some clots of <HI>gold ore.</HI> Pliny doth affirme that the same Gallecia, A∣sturia, and Lusitania, are as fertile of all maner of <HI>mettals.</HI> Stabo hath left recorded that amongst the sparkes of gold ore heere found some haue beene tried to waigh more then halfe a pound weight. Diodorus Siculus out of Phalereus reporteth the same, who saith, that some of those which heere do dig in the mines do euery three daies find as much in weight as an Euboian talent, which of Troy weight amounteth to aboue <HI>36.</HI> pound. Stephanus mentioneth the city Ibilla, where he saith there are mines both of <HI>siluer</HI> and <HI>gold.</HI> But the greatest siluer-mine is neere new Carthage, distant from the city about <HI>20.</HI> furlongs, where <HI>40000.</HI> men are emploied and set on worke; and euery day throughout the yeare, the people of Rome, as Strabo testifieth, receiued from hence <HI>25000.</HI> drams of siluer. The same author writeth that there was a pit of siluer cal∣led Bebelus, which did find Hanniball daily <HI>300.</HI> pound weight of siluer. That this pit was about the Pyreney mountaines, one peraduenture may gesse by that, which he withall affirmeth, that the Aquitani do fetch their water from hence. The great abundance of siluer which did runne from the Pyreney mountaines, being by casualtie set on fire (which story you shall find in Strabo and Diodorus Siculus) was such that the Phoenicians when they transported it from hence, and yet still there being left more than their ships could carry, in stead of lead they put it vnder the ancors, or, as Aristotle thinketh, about Tartessus they made their ancors of it. It is obserued by Strabo that the Turdetani did make their cribs (<HI>praesepia,</HI> yet the learned Causabone doth rather thinke that the Greeke word in this place should signifie <HI>Lacunaria,</HI> a sommer or maine beame in an house) and hogsheads, of siluer. Yea and that certaine riuers of this country do yeeld some sparkes of gold, amongst which Tagus in Lusitania was one, there is none of the old writers but did constantly affirme for truth. Whereupon the Poets of former times haue highly commended Spaine for this matter, to wit, Iuuenall and Sta∣tius: Item Silius Italicus in this verse: <HI>Hic certant Pactole tibi Durias{que} Tagus{que},</HI> Rich Pactolus now may yeeld, to Dwere and Tayo stout. The great abundance of mettals which this country did yeeld may easily be proued by the many triumphs of the Romanes, and maruellous store of gold and siluer by them carried and transported from hence; which you shall read of in Liuy, a plentifull witnesse and of good credit, in many and sundry places of his Decades, whereof for examples sake I thinke it not a∣misse to produce one or two: Marcus Heluius, saith he, brought from hence into the Exchequer at one time of vnwrought siluer <HI>14732.</HI> pound weight. Of coined siluer, bea∣ring the stampe of a waggon drawen with two horses, <HI>17023.</HI> Of Huesca siluer <HI>(Oscense argentum) 120438.</HI> Cneius Cornelius Lentulus brought from hence of gold <HI>1515.</HI> pound weight: of rough siluer <HI>1000.</HI> of siluer coine, <HI>34550.</HI> denaij, valuing of our money wel-neere <HI>1728.</HI> pound sterling. That which the same doth report of Marcus Portius Cato, Quintus Fuluius Flaccus, Quintus Minutius, Lucius Stertinius, Tiberius Gracchus, Cayus Calpurnius, Lucius Quinctius Crispinus, Marcus Fuluius Nobilior, Albinus, and others, let them read, who list to admire the wonderfull store of mettals of this country. Whereupon Antonius Augustinus might well say, That Spain in those times was vnto the Romanes the same, that now the West Indies are to the Spaniards. But now, lest I be too tedious, I will addresse my selfe to speake of other things which heere are found in as great abundance, as namely, <HI>horses, dogs, conies, pearles,</HI> and diuerse other such things. That in Spain there are great store of <HI>conies,</HI> Strabo, Pliny, and Aelianus do teach vs. The same is auerred by this verse of the worthy poet Catullus, <HI>Cuniculosae Celtiberiae fili,</HI> My sonne, in conny-borrow'd Spain ybred. Item, the coyn of Hadrian Emperour of Rome doth testifie the same: vpon which this little beast is stamped as a cognisance of this country. The <HI>wooll</HI> also of this country (I meane the blacke fleece, is of better estimation than that of the Coraxici, inhabitants of mount Taurus) the <HI>flax</HI> (wherof most excellent nets are made as Gratius witnesseth) <HI>Spartum,</HI> a kind of shrubbe like broome, whereof they made their cables, <HI>coccum,</HI> or graine wherewith they die skarlet, <HI>pitch, hony, wax, salt,</HI> digged out of the earth, <HI>(Sal fossile) Alume, Boras (Chrysocolla) glasse, vermilion,</HI> of no lesse estimation then Sinople <HI>(Sinopica terra) purple (purpurissum)</HI> and other colours, <HI>Crystall,</HI> the <HI>Loadstone,</HI> the Glasse-stone, <HI>(lapis specularis) vitrum obsidianum,</HI> the <HI>Ceraunij</HI> and <HI>Hyacinthi,</HI> certaine pearles and precious stones, are highly commended by Pliny, Strabo, Varro, Diodorus, Florus, Trogus; Dioscorides writeth that Spaine doth yeeld <HI>red oker, Cadmia, Schistus,</HI> and <HI>Sory.</HI> Pausanias in his Arcadica saith, that in Spaine, Cinoper <HI>(Cinnabaris)</HI> is commonly found in the same mine with gold. Theophrastus teacheth vs that the <HI>Corke-tree</HI> groweth plen∣tifully in the Pyreney mountains. Gellius, from the relation of Varro, doth wonderfully extoll the <HI>mast</HI> of Spaine. Heliodorus mentioneth the Spanisp <HI>Amethyst.</HI> The Nar, of the Corritani, a kind of fish called of the Latines <HI>perna,</HI> is by Strabo preferred before those of the Cantabri. Gellius commendeth the <HI>Lampreies</HI> taken neere Tartessus. of the maruellous fat <HI>Swine</HI> of this country Varro in the <HI>11.</HI> chapter of his <HI>2.</HI> booke of Husbandry, telleth a strange tale: to wit, that the skin did hang ouer their mouthes, a foot and three fingers. Oppianus and Iulius Pollux do greatly commend the <HI>Hounds</HI> of Spaine. So doth Nemesianus. <HI>Quorum proles de sanguine manat Ibero:</HI> Those whelps the huntsman most commend'th, That Spanish race doth yeeld. The same Varro and Oppianus with Strabo the great Cosmographer doe as highly extoll the
<PB REF="267"/> <HI>wild horses</HI> of this country. Of these I thinke Olympius Nemesianus did speake in these his verses: <HI>Quin etiam gens ampla iacet trans ardua Calpes Culmina, cor∣nipedum latè foecunda proborum &amp;c. Aut inconcusso glomerat vestigia dorso, Aut molli pacata celer trahit esseda collo.</HI> A mighty nation dwell'th beyond the stately tops of <HI>Calpe</HI> high, Which store of Horses good doth breed, esteem'd throughout the world so wide. Some pace it well and amble fine, they neuer hotch nor shake at all: Some draw in plough or cart as well, and runne vp hill as swift as wind. Item, Silius Italicus, an authour often in this history cited by me, reporteth the same, in these verses of his, <HI>Martius hic sompes campos hinnitibus implet, Hinc iuga cornipedes euecti bellica captant;</HI> The warlike steed with mighty noice doth fil the champi∣on fields. Martiall also thus speaketh of them, <HI>Hic breuis ad numerum rapidos qui colligit vngues, Venit ab armiferis gentibus Astur equus.</HI> This little nag that trot'th so fine, and tread'th the measures round, Did come from warlike Astures, t'was bred in Spanish ground. The forenamed Silius in another place speaketh thus of a∣nother kind: <HI>Hic parus sonipes, nec Marti notus.</HI> This little apish tit, For warlike seruice is not fit. Of this kind peraduenture Gratius speaketh thus: <HI>Non tamen Hispano Martem tentare minace ausim,</HI> I dare not for my life to serue in field, vpon the weake-limm'd Spanish tits. Perhaps this is that kind of horse which Pliny cal∣leth <HI>Thieldones,</HI> and <HI>Asturcones,</HI> Nags, Hobbies or Gennets, very small of bone and grow'th. Which in their trauell haue not an ordinary pace, as other horses, but by gathering vp their feet round do amble gently, which Plautus termeth <HI>tollutim incedere.</HI> Senecà in his Epistles calleth them <HI>Asturcones &amp; mannos tollutares,</HI> Ambling nags or gennets. Of the coach-horses (<HI>equi curules,</HI> or, <HI>quadrigales</HI>) bred heere, and for their extraordinary swiftnesse much esteemed farre and neere. Quin∣tus Aurelius Symmachus maketh a long discourse. Hee termeth this country <HI>equini pecoris diuitem,</HI> rich in multitude of good horses. Silius Italicus, the worthy poet saith, that these horses are so swift, that they will out strip the winds. Of mares got with foale by the wind, (neere the maine sea about Lisbone, or, as Silius writeth a∣mongst the Vettenes) in mount Sintra, <HI>(Tagrus)</HI> as Varro saith, or Cabo S. Vincente <HI>(mons sacer)</HI> as Columella would haue it) many men haue written many things, and more peraduenture then is true. All generally do attribute this to the nature and quality of the West wind in those parts. Varro and Columella do affirme that the colts or foales bred by this meanes do not liue aboue <HI>3.</HI> yeares: yet Silius saith that they will liue well till they be <HI>7.</HI> yeares old. Columella writeth, that it is a thing well knowen to euery man to be true: Varro telleth it for an incredible matter, yet very true; and withall affirmeth that mares do there conceiue by meanes of the wind, as heere hens doe: whose egs by him are called <HI>Hypenemia,</HI> or, <HI>Subuentanea,</HI> by Pliny <HI>Zephyria,</HI> that is, wind-egs. Aristotle in the <HI>5.</HI> and <HI>6.</HI> books of his history of Liuing creatures speaketh of these egs. And although Iulius Solinus, and S. Augustine, in his booke <HI>de ciuitate Dei,</HI> do write, that the same commeth to passe, to the mares in Cappadocia; and Homer would make the world beleeue that the North wind makes the mares of Erichthonius with foale, and that I am not ignorant that Aelianus in the <HI>25.</HI> chapter of his <HI>7.</HI> booke <HI>de Animalibus,</HI> doth thinke that euen the winds do make mares more fruitfull; yet I do rather thinke with Trogus that this did arise of the maruellous fruitful∣nesse of the mares and swiftnesse of the horses, which is such that in that respect there is iust cause to deeme them to haue beene begotten by the wind. Of these our Silius I∣talicus, himselfe a Spaniard borne, writeth thus: <HI>Et venerem occultam genitali concipitaura,</HI> By secret meanes they do conceiue, The wind doth make them big. And peraduenture Virgil in these his verses aim'd at this story. <HI>Omnes ore versae in Zephyrum stant rupibus altis, Exceptant{que} leues auras, &amp; saepe sine villis Coniu∣gijs vento grauidae, (mirabile dictu.)</HI> Beside these there are also certaine other miracles and strange things to be seene and obserued in Spaine. In Cadima (<HI>ager Car∣rinensis,</HI> or, <HI>Catinensis,</HI> as some copies haue it) there are two springs, whereof the one swalloweth vp all things that are cast into it, the other casteth them out. In the same prouince there is another which maketh all the fishes that are in it to seem as if they were of a golden colour: yet they being out of the water do nothing at all differ from those of other waters. In Cantabria the three Tamaricke fountaines (<HI>fontes Tamarici,</HI> Pliny nameth them) <HI>8.</HI> foot distant one from another, are ordinarily euery day <HI>12.</HI> times drie, and sometime <HI>20.</HI> times, so cleane that you can scarce discerne whether euer they had water in them or not. When as notwithstanding there is another large fountain hard by them that runneth continually; thus farre out of Pliny. Suetonius in Galba saith that a thunderbolt fell into a lake of Cantabria, and that there were <HI>12.</HI> hatchets <HI>(secures)</HI> found there. In Spaine there is a riuer which at the first sight differeth nothing from other waters: but if you listen but a little while, you shall heare the water make a fine whistling noice. For assoone as neuer so little wind shall but moue the pooles or deeper places, the water resoundeth melodiously like a musicall instrument. The wind striketh in manner of the quill, the water serueth in stead of the cittron, as Achilles Statius writeth in his <HI>1.</HI> booke <HI>De Amoribus.</HI> In the confines of Gallecia there is a mountaine called <HI>Mons Sacer,</HI> (Pico Sagro, the Spaniards do yet to this day call it) which it was not lawfull to dig or strike with any iron toole: but if at any time by fall of thunderbolt the ground were brokē, which in these countries is an ordinary thing, the gold which by that means shalbe discouered, is gathered by those which come next, as if it were a speciall gift and fauour of God, as Trogus in the <HI>44.</HI> booke of his History testifieth. Strabo writeth that in Lusitania (now Portugall) there is a kind of <HI>Salt</HI> found which is of a purple colour. Sidonius in Oresius affirmeth, That there is another kind of Salt digged out of the mountains of Tarracon, which is sweet and of a plea∣sant tast. Amongst the Hispani Albini about Iberus, Gellius out of Varro describeth a great mountaine all of cleane salt: from which looke how much soeuer you shall take from it, so much within a while it will wax and grow againe. Lucian in his vowes, maketh mention of Spanish pickle, or saltfish. Pliny writeth that vpon the sea coast of Cantabria there is a very steep high hill that is all nothing else but clean iron. Those which fall sick at Caliz <HI>(Gades)</HI> as Philostratus reporteth, cannot die, their soules can∣not depart from them, so long as the tide doth drowne or ouerflow the country. And thus much hitherto of old Spaine, <HI>terris omnibus terra foeliciore, cui excolendae at{que} adeo ditandae impensius quám caeteris gentibus</HI> (as Latinus Pacatus saith) <HI>supremus ille fabricator indulsit,</HI> that is, This land for goodnesse of soile excelleth all lands in the whole world beside: about the trimming and furnishing of which, and so consequently for the enriching of the same, almighty God creator of all, bestowed more time and care then ordinarily he did for other countries. The description of which I purpose to finish and close vp with that commendation, wherewith Pliny concludeth his Naturall history: <HI>Ab Italia, exceptis Indiae fabulosis, proximè quidem dixerim Hispaniam, quocum{que} ambitur mari,</HI> that is, Next after Italy, excepting al∣waies those fablous reports of India, I giue Spaine the commendations, vpon those sides especially which do butte vpon the sea.</P>
<P>Without the limits of the maine land or continent of Spaine, there is a part of this country called <HI>INSVLARIS,</HI> or <HI>BALEARIVM,</HI> that is, The Spanish iles, or, the Baleares. For this part of Spaine consisteth altogether of ilands. The names of those which do lie in the Ocean or Maine sea, are these, <HI>GADES</HI> (now <HI>Caliz) IV∣NONIS insula, GERYONIS monumentum, (S. Pedro,</HI> a little ile betweene Caliz and the maine land) <HI>LONDOBRIS,</HI> ouer against Portugall, now knowen by the name of <HI>Barlinguas; CORTICATA, AVNIOS, DEORVM insulae,</HI> peraduenture those which they now call <HI>Islas de Baiona;</HI> and the faigned <HI>CASSI∣TERIDES,</HI> in this tract. For these famous ilands are indeed those which our seamen call <HI>The Sorlings,</HI> belonging to the crowne of England, as we haue shewed before. In the Midland sea are these following: the two <HI>BALEARES,</HI> the Greater and the Lesser <HI>MALLORCA</HI> and <HI>MENORCA:</HI> the two <HI>PITYVSAE,</HI> to wit, <HI>EBV∣SVS,</HI> (now <HI>Yuica,</HI> or as some terme it <HI>Ibissa</HI>) and <HI>OPHIVSA; SCOMBRARIA (Cabo di Palos) COLVBRARIA, (Moncolobrer) CAPRARIA (Cabre∣ra) TIQVADRA (Coneiera) PLVMBARIA, PLANESIA,</HI> and <HI>MAENARIA,</HI> all of them, except only the Baleares and Gades, small ilands and of none ac∣count. Gades was much renowmed and famous long since by meanes of the fables of Hercules and Geryon feigned by Poets to haue been acted heere, as also for that the long liued king Arganthonius, who was before his death <HI>300.</HI> yeares old, did sometime keepe his court heere. The Baleares were much talked of, by reason the Ilanders were counted good slingers, best experienced and skilfull in that weapon called by the Romanes, <HI>Funda.</HI> But especially it was much spoken of by meanes of the great famine and dearth that there was caused by conies: of which there was sometime in these Ilands such wonderfull store and abundance, that old stories do testifie, that the country people were forced to entreat of Augustus Caesar a military aid and band of men to helpe to destroy them, keepe them from breeding and spreading any further. Pliny compareth the winds of these Ilands with the best that are made of Italian grapes. I do verily beleeue that Seruius vpon the <HI>7.</HI> booke of Virgils Aeneids did mistake the matter, when he writeth that Geryon did rule as king of the Baleares, and the Pityusaes. For all other writers do affirme, that he reigned and kept his court about Gades. Except in de∣fence of Seruius one should alledge this saying of Trogus: <HI>In parte Hispaniae quae ex insulis constat, regnum penes Geryonem fuit:</HI> that is, In a part of Spaine which consisteth altogether of ilands, Geryon swaied the scepter, and ruled as soueraigne king. But that he spake this of Gades, and the iland, not farre from it in the maine sea, the wonderfull pastorage and rankenesse which he ascribeth to these is a sufficient argument and proofe; which by no meanes may be verified of the Baleares. Againe, Solinus plainly testifieth for me that Bocchoris, and not Geryon, did reigne in the Baleares. But his owne words may perhaps please thee better; therefore listen, thus he speaketh: <HI>Bocchoris regnum Baleares fuerunt, vs{que} ad euersionem Phrygum cuniculis animalibus quondam copiosae. In capite Baeticae, vbi extremus est NOTI OR∣BIS terminus, insula à septingentis passibus separatur, quam Tyrij à Rubro profecti mari, ERYTHRAEAM, Poeni sua lingua GADIR, id est, sepem nominarunt. In hac Geryonem habitasse plurimis monumentis probatur, tametsi quidam putent Herculem boues ex alia insula abduxisse, quae Lu∣sitaniam contuetur.</HI> Thus rudely in English. The Baleares where Bocchoris, vntill the ouerthrow of the Phrygians, raigned and held his court, were sometime won∣derfully full of Conies. In the entrance and head of Baetica which is the outmost bound of the <HI>KNOVVEN WORLD,</HI> there is an iland which is distant from the maine land threescore and tenne pases. This the Tyrians, come from the Redsea, called <HI>ERYTHRAEA,</HI> or, The Red iland: but the Poeni or Carthaginians in their language named it <HI>GADIR,</HI> that is, The hedge. Heere Geryon did sometime dwell, as monuments and antiquities do strongly prooue; although some do thinke that Hercules did cary the Oxen from another iland, which lieth ouer against Lusitania. Thus farre Solinus. Obserue heere that <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Gader,</HI> in the ancient language of the Iewes, and</P>
<P><HI>Giadir,</HI> in the moderne tongue of the farre-conquering Arabians, doth signifie an hedge, enclosure, or fence. Beside these forenamed ilands knowen to the an∣cient and best writers Sextus Rufus Auienus reciteth others by these names: <HI>OESTRYMNIDES, ARCHALE, POETANION, AGONIDA, CARTARE, STRONGILE</HI> and <HI>LVNAE.</HI> These because no man else doth seeme to know or take notice of, peraduenture may be some of those which Pliny termeth <HI>mari vadoso par∣uas,</HI> Small ilands or shelues in the shallow sea, and are in number well neere twenty. What if to these I should adioine <HI>CROMYVSA</HI> and <HI>MELVSSA,</HI> certaine ilands vpon the coast of Spaine, as Stephanus citeth out of Hecataeus his Cosmography?</P>
<P>Of <HI>TRANSFRETANA</HI> or <HI>TINGITANA Hispania,</HI> that other part, I meane, of Spaine, beyond the streights, called Tingitania, (because it did only in name and vsurpation, not indeed and of right belong to Spaine: as also for that it is, thus Pomponius Melawriteth of it, <HI>Regio ignobilis, &amp; vix quidquam illustre sortita, paruis opidis habitatur, parua flumina emittit, solo quam viris melior, &amp; segnitiae gentis obscura,</HI> Abase country, and hath scarce any good thing in it worth the speaking of. It hath no famous cities but small ragged townes and villages. The riuers which runne through it are very small and not nauigable: yet the soile is better than the men. For the slouththfulnesse and cowardice of the people hath made the country the more obscure:) I will speake nothing of in this place.</P>

<HEAD>GALLIA, (now FRANCE) as it was in the time of STRABO <HI>and the rest of the ancient Geographers.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Ll that tract of the earth, which the Ocean, the midland sea, the Pyreney mountaines and the riuer Rheine do containe and compasse, is cal∣led of old wtiters GALLIA or GALACIA, and the inhabitants CELTI or CELTAE. Whereupon Ptolemey properly named it CEL∣TOGALACIA. We haue demonstrated and shewed at large in the olde map of Europe, that the name <HI>Celtes</HI> was more generall in times past: and that <HI>Gallia</HI> did reach beyond the Alpes as farre as the riuer Rubicon; because indeed that part of Italy (as we know) was possessed and in∣habited by them. But we purpose heere onely to describe that which is properly and truly called <HI>Gallia,</HI> whose bounds we haue set downe to be the Ocean, the Rhine and the mountaines. This the Romanes diuided into GALLIA TRANSALPINA, that is, Gallia beyond the Alpes and GALLIA CISALPINA, that is, Gallia on this side the Alpes. Mela and Plinic diuided it into two parts, the one lying Northward, the other Southward: this Pliny and his imitatour Solinus by the two hils Gebenna and lura: Mela by the hill Gebenna and the riuer Rhosne: after whch maner alio Entropius and Suetonius do distinguish it. They call that part, which is toward the North GALLIA COMATA; be∣cause the inhabitants did weare long haire: the other toward the South GALLIA BRACCATA, of a short kind of coat, which the people of that countrie did commonly goe in. The whole is diuided of Caesar into three parts: of the which one (saith he) is inhabited by the BEL∣GAE, another by the AQVITANI, and the third by them, who in their tongue are called CELTAE, and in ours GALLI. The riuer Ga∣ronde parteth the Celtes from the Aquitanes, and the riuers Seine and Marne doe diuide them from the Belgae. But GALLIA NARBO∣NENSIS is not mentioned in this diuision: which part Pliny and Pomponius Mela do describe seuerally by it selfe, and Caesar comprehendeth it vnder the name of PROVINCE. Notwithstanding Ptolemey in his description, and Ammianus, who followeth him, doth attribute it vnto Gallia, and diuide the whole into foure parts, to wit, AQVITANIA, LVGDVNENSIS (the very same with <HI>Celtica</HI>) BELGICA and NARBONENSIS. But all doe not limite this diuision with the same bounds. For Caesar placeth the <HI>Heluetians</HI> next to the Gaules or Celtes, whom Pliny and the foresaid Ptolemey place in Belgica. Caesar maketh Belgica to reach from the Rhine to Marne, Pliny from the riuer Scaldis to the Seine. Caesar placeth the riuer Garonde as the bound betweene the Celtes and the Aquitanes, so likewise doth Pomponius Mela; but Strabo boundeth it with the riuer Loire, and that according to the prescript of Augustus, with whom also Ptolemey doth agree. The foresaid Strabo (following I know not what authors) saith that the Belgae inhabite be∣tweene the Rhine and the Ocean and amongst them numbreth the Veneti, the vtmost people that dwell towards the West sea. But I feare much, lest in that place in sted of Belgae he should haue said Celtae, seeing that according to all Geographers and Historiographers the people Veneti are placed in Gallia Celtica or Lugdunensis. Succeeding ages diuided the whole country of Gallia into many parts, as we may read in Sextus Rufus, Ammianus, a booke intituled Liber Notitiar: and another called Dignitatum Libellulus, which authors doe reckon all the parts and regions thereof to bee seuenteene; all which we offer to thy view in this our map. But afterward in processe of time, to wit, after the time of Charlemaine it was diuided only into two parts the one AVSTRASIA, that is, East France, the other NEVSTRIA (as they corruptly write it) or <HI>Vestria</HI> or rather <HI>Westria,</HI> that is, West France. And so much concerning the name of this countrie, the limitation and the bounds, which Suetonius in the life of Iulius affirmeth to containe in compasse 32. hundred miles. Now it remaineth that we write somewhat in like maner of the nature, temperature and commodities of the same.</P>
<P>Claudian writeth that it is a most blessed and a happy country in respect of the situation of it. And Caesar in his third booke of Ciuil wars reporteth it to be most healthful. Seneca in his third of Naturall Questions saith it is full of brookes and riuers. Solinus recordeth it had in times past sacred and vaporous fountaines. Strabo describeth it to be all well watered and moistned with brooks and riuers, and that the places, along which they runne, are for the most part champion grounds (for Sidonius saith, that heere are large and o∣pen) or else small rising hils. The same authour recordeth that it beareth great store of graine, millet, and maste, and that it breedeth all maner of cattell. [The forementioned Sido∣nius in Maioranus his Panegyricke writeth that it is plentifully stored with cattel.] There is in it nothing superfluous, vnlesse it be, where it is either marrish or fenny, or ouergrown with wood. Trebellius in his Balista maketh it to be fruitfull of graine, which same thing Cicero affirmeth to be true in his oration for Marcus Fonteius: where hee wrireth that great store of corne was woont to be carried out of this country by the Romanes, and we may read in Caesars third booke of his Commentaries and in Dions 39. booke how they did vse to send their Ambassadours for prouision of corne vnto the Veneti, a people of this country. But Pliny testifieth that this corne was the lightest and worst kind of all those sorrs of corne that were vsually brought to Rome. The same authour in another place hath left in writing that the people of Aquitane did eate panicke. Solinus extolleth France for a fortunate country in respect of the fatnesse of the soile, and many rich commodities, in many places also replenished with vines and orchards &amp; blessed with store of all things necessarie for the behoofe of man. But let vs heare also what Pomponius Mela saith of this countrie. It is a land verie fruitfull, chieflie of grasse and corne, and pleasant to behold and beautified with many great and goodly forrests. Any kind of corne, that cannot well away with cold, the country yeeldeth not euery where, neither is there heere any great store of hurtfull and noisome beasts. Let vs heere also what Iulian the Emperour in his Misopogones, an eie-witnesse saith of this country: The winter there is most milde, by rea∣son of the heat of the Ocean as it is thought, or else it may be because there bloweth thence a certaine soft gale of winde: and the sea water seemeth to bee warmer than the fresh water. Whether it be therefore for this reason, or for any other vnknowen to me, I cannot tell, yet of this I am sure that this is true. The Winter of that land is verry temperate and milde to the inhabitants: moreouer the best vines do grow there: and many also by their art and industrie haue now made fig-trees to grow there, which in winter they are faine to couer ouer with wheat straw or stubble and such like things, as it were with clothes, thereby to defend them from the violence and iniuries of the aire. Thus farre out of Iulian. It is true indeed that the cold, (because the country, according to Caesar in his first booke of Commentaries lieth farre North) is woont to stay and slacke the ripenesse of corne. Wherefore we may fitly adde to this place that, which Varro hath set downe in his first booke of husbandrie: In Gallia Transalpina (saith he) there are some regions bor∣dering vpon the Rhine, where neither vine, nor oliue, nor apples would grow, vnlesse they did dung their grounds with a kind of white chaulke digged out of the earth, which Pliny calleth <HI>marga,</HI> that is, marle. but Claudian termeth it <HI>Galliam niue feratem,</HI> France fertile of snow: and Lucian speaketh of French ice: and hence commeth that prouerbe in Petronius Arbiter, <HI>Colder than French snow.</HI> Insomuch that Diodorus confesseth, that when the riuers are frozen ouer, they are not only passable to few, but euen to whole armies, with their carts and waggons. He addeth likewise, that in steed of water it is replenished with snow. Heerehence it is, if I be not deceiued, that Aristotle reporteth amongst his wonders, that France breedeth no asses. Seneca in his third booke of Naturall questions affirmeth it to be windie. The North-West winde <HI>(Circius)</HI> (saith he) annoieth France: to it, notwithstanding that be ready to ouerthrow their houses and buildings, they giue thankes, as to whom they attribute their healthfulnesse, which peraduenture might seeme false and fabulous, if the same author did not in that very place adde these words following: Augustus (who was afterward made a god) erected and dedicated a temple to this wind, at such time as he soiourned in France. Of this wind you may reade more in Aulus Gellius his 2. booke 22. chapter, but I take it to be that Northen winde, which infecteth those places called <HI>Campi lapidei</HI> Stondon, (whereof we shall speake heereafter) where these things are knowen to be true euen to this day. Cicero in his oration <HI>De prouineijs consu∣laribus,</HI> moued (as it seemes) with the sharpnesse of this aire, cried out truly or falsly. What can be found more sharpe or rough, than those places? What more desolate than their townes? What more barbarous than their nations? What more large than their Ocean? Yet for all that, the nature of the aire and soile neuer letted or hindered, but that they learned either of Rome from her cradle, (as Macrobius witnesseth in his 2. booke vpon <HI>Somnium Scipionis,</HI> or of the Massilians as reporteth Trogus 43. to plant both vines and oliues. Pliny noteth that one Elico, a Swisser or Heluetian (hauing beene entertained at Rome for his skill in smiths worke and carpentrie) at his returne againe into his country, brought ouer with him drie figs and raisons, oile &amp; wine. From which time afterwards there was such plenty of vines, that Columella doth as it were complaine, that the Italians did lay vp their vintage here: and Plutarch recordeth that they did vse to send to Rome from Vienna in France that wine, which of a kind of taste that it had of pitch was called <HI>vinum Pica∣tum,</HI> assoone as it began to be in request there. Therefore I would gladly vnderstand what Vopiscus and Eusebius should meane, who deliuer that the Emperour Probus was the first that granted the Gauls to plant and set vines. Shall any man thinke that vntill his time there were no vines in any part of France, sauing onely in Prouince? Yet Pliny maketh mention of the vine of Berrie, likewise of the vine of Auuergne. I must needs confesse my shallownesse of vnderstanding heerein. Iulian the Emperour writeth in his Misopogones, that in his time there was an excellent vine at Paris, and Isidorus commendeth the vine of Berrie. Strabo plainly sheweth that there were heere mettals both gold and siluer and the best sort thereof in the mountaine Cemmenus, now called <HI>Mountaignes de' Auergne,</HI> or, <HI>de Ceuennes,</HI> as Poldus affirmeth. That there were also excellent gold-mines among the Tar∣belli, and iron mines in Perigort and Berrie. Athenaeus writeth that gold was digged vp in some part of Celtica. Ausonius calleth Tarne, a riuer of Aquitane, the golden floud. Diodorus in his fifth booke reckoneth vp in it diuers golden riuers: from hence it commeth, as we reade in Procopius, that the Gauls did coine gold found in their own natiue soile, which was not stamped like other money, with the picture of the Romane Emperours, but only with a stampe of their owne. Cassiodorus in his seuenth booke, and 37. section of his <HI>Variar.</HI> maketh mention of their coine in these words: <HI>Gallis auctoribus sine aliquo adhuc signo ad metalla translata est;</HI> Hence it arose, as seemeth that of Manilius Gallia is tearmed rich; of Dion, flourishing in wealth: of Iosephus, the rich Galles: and in Sibyls oracles, the Galles wealthy in gold. And howsoeuer Diodorus writeth that they haue no siluer, yet Athenaeus reporteth that a wood by a mischance being set on fire so inflamed the Pyreney mountaines that there issued and ran foorth great streames of melted siluer. Moreouer Strabo reporteth that there were siluer mines among the Rutheni and Gabali, certaine nations and people of Aquitane: and Caesar speaketh of certaine mines of brasse in diuers places. It is obserued by Pliny that the Amethyst, a kind of iasper, is found in France; as also Corall, neere Marsiles about the Ilands Stoechades. There is also found Amber, in a riuer of the Celtae, if we may beleeue Dion Prusaeus. For as I thinke it to be true if he meant it of the Celto-Germanes, so I deeme it false, if he meant it of the Celto-Galles. There grow heere also, as Pliny affirmeth, the purple <HI>vaccinia</HI> or whortles, wherewith they did vse to die clothes for their seruants and slaues. In another place he attributeth to this coun∣try those rich tinctures of scarlet, purple and tyrian, which were in such high estimation at Rome. To the same doth Vitruuius assigne another sort of scarlet die. It is true by the te∣stimony of Galen that Nard (which tne Apothecaries vsed for to make treacle withall) was wont to be brought out of France. Pliny sheweth that the best sort of firre that were, grew vpon the mountaines Iura and Vogesus: and elsewhere, that birch first came out of France, which they did vse to boile and out of it to draw a glutinous and clammy slime, which serued in steed of bitumen: Item, that the herbe hyacinth or crow-toe do grow and prosper there exceedingly: that they sow line or flaxe, wherwith being spun and wouen (as Strabo writeth) they make sailes, although Caesar auoucheth that the Veneti people of America or Britaine did vse skinnes or leather in steed of sailes. That there did grow the citron-tree may be gathered out of Paterculus, who affirmeth that Iulius Caesar made preparation for his French triumph of the citron-tree. But as there are in this country these and such like herbs and trees, for the profit and vse of man: so are there those that be venemous and pernicious to mans nature. Of which sort is the yew tree, and thereof, accor∣ding to the testimony of Caesar, very great plenty, which Dioscorides doth deliuer to be in Narbone of so deadly a poison, that whosoeuer do either sleepe vnder it, or shall sit and rest themselues in this shade, they be not only hurt, but oft times they do catch their death by it. Concerning which tree Pliny addeth this much, that it hath beene found by ex∣perience, that in France the wine bottles made thereof for wayfaring men and trauellers haue killed and poisoined those that drunke out of them: And Caesar witnesseth, that one Cat uulcus king of the Eburones made away himselfe with the iuice of the yew tree, whereof (saith he) there was great abundance in France. Aristotle amongst his wonders ma∣keth mention of a kind of poison which is found in this country, called of them <HI>xenicon,</HI> the Greeke copy hath <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But heereof, heereafter we shall haue occasion to speake in another place. And this much concerning things without life: now concerning liuing creatures by your patience we will in as few words as we may, set down what we haue read and obserued written by all ancient writers. Trebellius in the life of Claudius the Emperour maketh mention of a famous breed of mares in this country. The infinite number of dogs of this nation be not only highly commended by the Poets, Ouid, Oppian and Gratius; but euen also by Pollux the Grammarian, and Euphrada the oratour. Pliny saith that he saw with his owne eies in the grand cirque of Pompey the great a hart-woolfe <HI>(Lupus ceruarius)</HI> brought out of France. Their swine, according to the relation of Strabo, be no∣table for their bignesse, strength and swiftnesse, which are to him that is not vsed to them, as dangerous as the fiercest wolues. For which cause it cannot be denied but that Athe∣naeus wrote very truly that they had the best bacon, and that (the aforesaid Strabo bearing witnesse) in such plenty, that from hence they did therewith furnish not only Rome, but also most places of Italy. I obserue out of Varro his tract <HI>de lingua Latinâ,</HI> that is, of the Latin tongue, that there be heere very great hares: in which authour also there is mention made of French wooll, which according to Strabo is very course. If any credit be to be giuen to the forceited Pliny, there is found in the vpper coasts of France towards the North Ocean fowle like to a swan called <HI>Onocrotalus:</HI> item, as he saith, there is found fresh Saln on: in the French Ocean a mighty sea fish called <HI>Physeter,</HI> or a whirlepoole, raising him∣selfe vp aloft out aboue the sea, in maner of a great columne or pillar, higher then the very sailes of ships, spouting out as it were a deluge of waters, ready to drowne and sinke euen very tall ships: likewise there are, as the same authour saith, mearmaids, elephants and sea-rammes. In the riuer Sone, as Stobeus gathereth out of Calisthenes, there breedeth a huge kind of fish, called of the inhabitants therabouts <HI>Clupea,</HI> which while the moone increaseth, seemeth white of colour: and the same decreasing groweth blacke and when his body groweth to be of an extraordinary bignesse, he is killed of his owne chines or bones. In the head of this fish is found a small stone, not vnlike to a graine of Salt, (Plutarch in his booke <HI>de Montibus,</HI> affirmeth it to be like a crumme or little quantity of Frankincense) which is a speciall remedy against the quartane ague, if in the wane of the moone it be but applied to the left side of the body. Glycas out of Anastasius tearmeth this fish <HI>Clopia,</HI> but Plutarch, in the place before quoted, nameth it, <HI>Scolopidon.</HI> It is almost incredible what a maruellous multitude of frogs be heere: such was, I say, the abundance of them, that the inhabitants of a certaine city were driuen out and forced to seeke another place to dwell in. Yet Pliny, of whom we haue so often spoken, auoucheth it to be true, citing Varro for his authour; and Trogus in his 15. booke confirmeth it, affirming the like thing to haue hap∣pened to the Abderites, a certaine people of Thrace. But let vs come to other more wonderfull things of this region: and first the history of fishes digged out of the ground, is as strange as any, of which Pomponius Mela vseth these very words: In Gallia Narbonensis is the fountaine Salsula, which shedeth water not sweet but more brackish than the water of the sea. Hard by is a field all greene and couered ouer with short and slender reeds, yet otherwise it swimmeth and floteth aloft vpon a pole that beareth it vp. That it is so, the middle part of it plainly prooueth, which being cut off from the rest about it, swimmeth like an Iland, and suffereth it selfe to be shoued and drawne to and fro. Moreouer by those

<PB REF="269"/> places also that are cut and digd quite through, appeareth the sea sheaded vnderneath it. Whereupon, whether it were through ignorance of the truth, or that they were purposely disposed to make a leasing, it liked is well our authours as also the Greeks, to leaue in writing vnto such as should come after, fish was digged out of the whole ground in that country, which indeed comming out of the deepe sea thither, and there being, killed by such as bobbed for them, was drawen dead out of the aforesaid holes. This much out of him. Now whether Strabo and Athenaeus be to be numbred amongst those Greeke writers, whose credit Mela doth extenuate heerein, I know not. For Strabo in his 4. book de∣liuereth, that about the riuer Ruscino (in the very same prouince that Mela there describeth) there is a lake not far from it, and a little farder off from the sea a waterish fenny piece of ground, full of salt pots, wherein are mullets, which are woont to be drawen and taken out of the earth. For as soone as a man diggeth 3. or 4. foot deepe into the ground, thrusting an eel-speare into the mud, a man shall sometime chance to sticke or kill the foresaid fish, being of a reasonable growth and bignesse. This kind of fish, like the eele, is bred and li∣ueth in the mudde. Thus writes he. Athenaeus in his 8. booke, out of Polybius his 34. booke of histories saith thus: that from the Pyreney mountaines vntil you come to Narbon, the fields, all along through the wh ch the riuers Iliberis and Ruscino do runne, be plaine and champion, in which fields are found those fishes which they tearme fossiles, that is, digged out of the ground. For the soile of that place is soft and greene, much grasse growing thereon: vnderneath the grasse, the earth being for two or three cubites deepe san∣dy, you shall find water that hath soaked thither and issued foorth out of the riuers, in which fishes doe wander through those streames for their food, being exceedingly delighted with the roots of the grasse. All that coast is full of fishes vnder the ground, which assoone as the earth is cast vp, they take. And D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lechampius vpon Athenaeus hath obserued that this maner of fishing doth as yet in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat place continue euen to this day. I haue beene alwaies of this mind, that that little history which Aristotle hath left in writing in his booke of wonders may fitly be referred hither: how that in the borders of the Marseilles nere the Ligusticke sea, there is a lake, which bubbling and streaming foorth casteth out an infinit multitude of fishes, exceeding all beliefe &amp;c. Pliny in his 9. booke, chapter 17. saith, that if in that season, when mullets vse to ingender, in the prouince of Narbone, a man take a milter out of their pooles where they are kept, and draw a long string or line through the mouth and guils and so tie it fast and then put him into the sea, holding the other end of the line still in his hand, if he pull him againe vnto him, he shall haue a number of spawners or females follow him hard at the taile to the bankes side. Semblably, if he do the same with the female in spawning time, he shall haue as many milters follow after her. In the very same prouince, after the same authour, is there a famous well named <HI>Orge,</HI> within the very head wherof grow certaine herbs, so much desired and sought for by kine and oxen, that to seeke and get a mouthfull of them, they will thrust in their whole heads ouer their eares, vntill they meet therewith. In another place of Pliny I read this following: There is a city of Gallia named Tungri, much renowmed for a noble fountaine, which runneth at many pipes: a waft it hath resembling the rust of iron, howbeit this taste is not perceiued but at the farewell and when you haue done drinking only. this water is purgatiue and driueth away tertian agues, expelleth the stone and cureth the symptomes attending thereupon: Set this water ouer the fire or neere vnto it, and you shal see it thicke and troubled; but at the last it will become red. Moreouer this prouince, as it is described of S. Augustine in his booke <HI>De ciuitate Dei,</HI> hath a fountaine about Gratianopolis, or Grenoble, very like the holy well in Epyre, which, if you dip a burning torch therein, it presently quencheth it, and if you hold it a good way off without any fire on it, of it owne nature kindleth it againe. Artimedorus is authour, that vpon the sea coast of France there is a lake, which is called <HI>Lacus duorum coruorum,</HI> that is, the lake of the two crowes, in which he saith two crowes were ordinarily to be seene, each of them hauing their right wings white of colour. Hither repaire all those that haue any matter in controuersie, and vpon a table set on high, each party for himselfe layth downe a cake. When the crowes flie thither, they deuour one cake, and the other they breake all to crums: but he obtaineth the cause against his aduersary, whose cake is broken and cast downe. But Strabo iudgeth this history to be but a meere fable. Aristotle also amongst his wonders reckoneth the high way called in his time <HI>Heraclea via,</HI> which is reported to haue reached from Italy euen to the Celto-Galles, or Celtiberi. On this way all passengers whether Greekes or homeborne are carefully looked vnto, or guarded by the inhabitants, lest any harme by mischance befall them in their iourney. For they in whose borders the harme is done, are by law punished or bound to make good the losse. Vitrunius writeth, that in Marsiles tiles are made, which being cast into the water do swim and not sinke. I may now fitly amongst these wonders describe that field which is called <HI>Campus lapideus,</HI> that is, Stondoun, or Stone-field. Geographers do place it betweene Marsiles and the mouth of the riuer Rhone: Pliny calleth it the me∣moriall of Hercules his battels: because that Hercules in this place fighting against Albion &amp; Bergion the sons of Neptune, and hauing spent all his artillery, called vpon his father Iupiter, who powred downe a shewre of stones for his defence and aid: and a man would verily beleeue that it had rained stones indeed, there lie so many, heere and there, and those so farre bespread euery way. This fable also is confirmed by Mela, Solinus, Higinus and Martianus: yet before them all I willingly preferre the opinion of Strabo, who de∣scribeth it: There is a plaine distant from the sea about an hundred stadia or furlongs, about so much ouer from one side to the other, and it is in compasse round. It is of the euent called the stony plaine. For it is full of stones, as big as a man can gripe, vnderneath which groweth grasse, yeelding great store of pasture for cattell: but within the midst thereof there is water, saltpits and salt. The whole region that bordereth vpon it vpwards, lieth open to winds: but vpon this plaine chiefly lieth and bloweth the violent and impetuous Northerne winde, wherewith, men say, stones are hoised vp and whirled in the aire and men blowen down out of waggons and with the force thereof stript both of armour and apparrell. The same authour also bringeth this probable reason of Possidonuis, who said that it had sometimes beene a lake, which when it was dried vp by reason of the conti∣nuall tossing and drift of the water this way and that way, was thereby parted into many stones, resembling somewhat those pebble stones on the banks of riuers, or sea-shoare ve∣ry like one another in greatnesse and smoothnesse &amp;c. Aristotle in his 2. booke of Meteors and 8. chapter affirmeth it to haue beene made so stony by an earthquake and nameth it the <HI>Phlegraean plaine.</HI> Diodorus describeth the very same plaine (although not by the same name) together with the wind infecting it. The forrest of Ardrine is heere also (in Belgica I meane) of which Tacitus, in his 5. booke of Annals, writeth thus: They sought those forrests, which were named <HI>Arduenna.</HI> Are there then many of this name? Can it be proued to be so out of Pomponius Mela, because that in one place he saith that Gallia is pleasant to behold by reason of many goodly great forrests? I cannot thinke it to be true: consi∣dering that in all old histories (for as much as I know) there is mention made only of one wood or forest of this name. Notwithstanding I am perswaded that it was scattred both in length and breadth and happily one part disioined from another, yet all vnder one and the selfe same name. For Caesar auoucheth it to be of a huge bignesse: and indeed euen the greatest forest in all Gallia, as that which extendeth it selfe from the riuer Rhine through the middle of the country of the Treuires vnto the entrance of the borders of Rhemes, and then declined towards the place, where the riuers Skeld and Maze meet together: so that it was more than 500. miles in length. These 500. miles (allowing eight stadia for a mile) do amount vnto 4000. stadia, which number Strabo doth assigne it, but out of authours (as he supposeth) not worthy to be beleeued, if that place of his be vncorrupt. For the learned Causa bonus, the glory of France, and honour of that his countrey, in his learned Commentaries vpon the said writer, scarse thinketh the place to be without error. Neither doth it seeme to me likely to be true, that Caesar, who was an ey-witnesse of this forest, was ignorant of the measure thereof. That Diana was sirnamed Arduenna of this forest, is proued out of an old monument of marble, whereof we shal speake more at large heereafter. And thus farre concerning the region. Now it followeth to treat of the people. Pausinias maketh it a populous region: and Liuy, fruitfull of men. Polybius also in his 2. booke of ciuill wars, witnesseth the same. For he writeth that Caesar subdued 400. diuers people of this realme of France. Iornandes saith that they exceed the cōmon stature of men. Their bodies according to Hirtius are to be maruelled at for their mighty lims &amp; great∣nesse, and according to Ammianus they were tall of stature. And that they are of exceeding talnesse aboue other nations, it is apparant out of Caesar, when he saith, that in respect of their owne talnesse and goodly personages, all the Gauls for the most part accompt the Romanes but very dwarfes. Moreouer that they were tall of stature, tender and soft fle∣shed, and very faire complexioned, Strabo plainly testifieth. That they were whitely coloured and snowt-faire these words of Petronius vnto Gyrton do seeme to approue, <HI>Increta facies, vt Gallia suos ciues putet:</HI> Their faces were painted, that France might thinke them to haue beene French men borne. Namely, that by that meanes they might counterfet the naturall beauty and whitlinesse of the Gauls: and not, as my singular good friend, in that his most learned and exact description of England writeth, who thinketh that the Gauls were wont to cleare their faces to make them looke more beautified: which cannot be proued out of any ancient authour, if I do not forget my selfe. And no maruell, seeing that nature it selfe hath voluntarily bestowed vpon them this beauty and whitenesse. From hence it is, that the Poet saith that the Gauls had <HI>Lactea colla,</HI> that is, white necks. That they did vsually weare their haire long (for which cause one part of Gallia was termed <HI>Comata</HI>) I haue for my authours Strabo and Clemens Alexandrinus: as also Agathias, who writeth that it was an ordinarie custome amongst the kings of France neuer to be cut or polled but to continue vnshauen from their cradle to their dying day, and to haue their locks hang∣ing trimly vpon their shoulders, with their haire before curiously sheaded, and falling downe vpon either shoulder. This their haire Liuy deliuereth to haue beene long and yellow. Diodorus saith it was naturally reddish, and yet they augment this colour by art. For according to Leopardus the interpreter in his emendations they washed their haire continu∣ally with a lie made of chalke and turned it vp from the forehead toward the crown and noddle, to the end that they might be conspicuous and eminent, and that their looke might seeme to be most like to Panes and Satyres. They likewise made their haire so thicke, that it differed nothing from the manes of horses. Was this the reason then that Claudian happily saith <HI>Gallia crine ferox,</HI> that is, The Frenchman grim of countenance by reason of his long haire? Pliny affirmeth that sope was an inuention deuised by the French for to co∣lour the haire of their head yellow: in somuch that Claudian saith, that the Frenchmen haue <HI>aureos vertices,</HI> that is, yellow heads: and Virgil saith, they haue <HI>aureas caesaries,</HI> that is, golden lockes. To this purpose also are those words, which Tertullian vseth in his booke <HI>De cultu Foeminarum,</HI> that is, of the ornaments of women, where he deliuereth that some of them did vse to colour their haire with saffron. To the very like reason Ammianus calleth the French <HI>Candidos &amp; rutilos,</HI> whitish and ruddy, borrowing their denomination from their skin and haire. I read in Liuy that they all weare long beards. Diodorus set it them out in their true colours, thus. Some saith he, shaue their beards, other some let them grow, although not ouer long. The gentle men and noblemen shaue their cheekes, but they suffer their beards to grow on their chin so long, vntill they couer their bodies. Whereby it commeth to passe, that when they eate, they are euery foot full of crummes and meat: and when they drinke, the drinke will run down as it were through a pipe or channel. They vse all meanes that can inuent, that they grow not too fat and gorbellied: and if any yong man exceed the prescript and set measure of his girdle, he is (as Strabo recordeth) amer∣ced for it. And so much concerning their outward forme and fauour. Now it remaineth to speake somewhat of their nature and disposition, whereof because no writer is more skilfull for knowledge and more ancient for writing than Caesar; take these his words, as they lie scattered heere and there in sundrie places of his Commentaries: The counsels saith he, of the Gauls be hasty and sudden: in their consultations they be variable and for the most part desirous of alteration. This is a common custome among them, to compel euen wayfaring men to stay whether they will or no, and to enquire what newes any man either hath heard, or knoweth of any matter whatsoeuer. And the common people vse to come flocking about the merchants in cities and do vrge them to tell out of what countries they come, and what things they know of there. And being moued with these light re∣ports and hearesaies, they fall to counsell oftentimes euen of most weighty matters: whereof they must needs repent them by and by after, seeing they are so fondly led by vncer∣taine rumours, and seeing also that diuers persons do tell them forged newes to feed their fancies withall. Thus farre Caesar. Moreouer of these people we may read the very same things almost in Polybius, Orosius, Trebellius and Vopiscus. But this peculiar custome of theirs, which they haue in their councels and assemblies, is not to be omitted, which is (as Strabo reporteth) thus: if saith hee, any man among them with noise or other tumult troubleth him that is speaking, the sergeant commeth vnto him with a naked sword or knife in his hand, and commandeth him to hold his peace, threatning him therewith: thus he doth three times, and then if the party holdeth not his peace, and be not quiet, he cutteth off so much of h s cassocke, that all the rest shalbe good for no vse at all. Diodorus and Strabo affirme them to be sharpe witted, and not without some smattering know∣ledge of learning: So likewise doth Symmachus, who commendeth their studies in good lettets. Polybius more maliciously bent against them is not ashamed to say that they nei∣ther apply themselues to learning nor to any maner of trade. But now heare what Hirtius reporteth of them: They be plaine dealing men, and no way deceitfull, they vse to fight their battels by prowesse and not by treacherie. Likewise Strabo thus commendeth them: they be of an honest disposition, without fraud or guile, and no whit malicious or spite∣full. Is it not for this cause thinke you, that of the same authour in another place they are called <HI>Simplices,</HI> simple? of Seruius, <HI>Pigrioris ingenij,</HI> of a dull wit? of Firmicus, <HI>stolidos,</HI> foo∣lish? of Iulian, <HI>Stupidos &amp; rusticitatem amantes,</HI> blockish and affecting a certaine kind of clownishnesse? But on the contrary side, hearke what Lucius Florus writeth: Let no man only cal the French fierce or stout; for they are crafty fellowes and can do what they entend, very politickely. Is this falsly? Or is it true, and likely that they learned it afterwards of the Romanes? Who (as Trogus recordeth) had sent Seruilius into Africa and had giuen him a priuy charge, if by any meanes he could, to make away Hanniball through the helpe of those, who most of all enuied his greatnesse. But neither was this true, being improued by Iulian the Emperour, that was an eie-witnesse, and daily conuersant amongst them, and therefore the rather in this case to be beleeued, who not only after the aforesaid Florus, but also after all ancient writers whatsoeuer, giueth this commendation of them: to wit, that they know not how to Hatter: they liue honestly and simply without deceit or dissimulation with all men, according to the lawes of iustice and equity: they only intertaine Venus, the goddesse of marriage, for wedlocke and issue; and Bacchus, the authour of mirth, that they may haue a sufficient competency of wine to drinke. Aelian reporteth that of all men liuing they are the readiest to vndergo dangers: Florus saith, that they be <HI>Immanissimos,</HI> most sauage: Cicero and Eumenus, <HI>Immanes &amp; barbaros,</HI> cruell and barbarous: Lucane, Trogus and Hegesippus, <HI>Feroces,</HI> fierce: Auienus and Seneca, <HI>Truces,</HI> stern or grin: Cassiodorus, <HI>Crudeles,</HI> cruell: Lucan, <HI>Sanguineos,</HI> bloudy: Lampridius saith that they haue <HI>Duras &amp; retrogradas mentis,</HI> hard and backsliding false harts. Vopiscus affirmeth that they be, <HI>Gentium omnium inquietissimos,</HI> of all nations the vnquietest: Liuy and Polybius, <HI>Molles &amp; effoeminatos,</HI> delicate and effeminate and the same Polybius in another place, faithlesse and giuen much to surfettings and drunkennesse; which same thing also Diodorus Athe∣naeus and Clemens Alexandrinus doe confirme to be true. The afore-cited Liuy sayth, that they are exceedingly prone to anger, which this nation is not able to bridle or mode∣rate, and withall they are very couetous. Mela writeth that they be proud and superstitious: Silius, <HI>Vaniloquos,</HI> vaine bablers and Plutarch in his Pyrrhus, that they are exceeding co∣uetous of money. Such like praises hath this nation, but all of them proceeding from a deadly sore, and therefore let them approoue and iustifie the truth of these their assertions. Neuerthelesse there be extant, amongst other, these two examples of their cruelty: the one of them in T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogus, who writeth that in their warre and fight against Antigonus, when by diuination by the inwards of beasts offered in sacrifice, their vtter destruction and ouerthrow was foretold; they not cast into any amazement or feare, but rather rapt with furie and madnesse, killed their wiues and children, beginning the hopefull successe of this warre with a most vnnaturall murder &amp;c. The other example you may see in Lucius Flo∣rus, who deliuereth that some of them taken prisoners in battell, did assay to bite and gnaw atwo the chaines they were bound withall, and that they did cut one anothers throats. Vnlesse a man would rather thinke that these were proofes and examples of their loue of liberty. For both Orosius and Leo the Emperour haue left in writing that this people is most desirous of liberty. Notwithstanding Pausanias in his Phocicam, sheweth their great valour in that battell at Thermopilae. I cannot but woonder in my mind at Marcus Victorinus, who calleth these men dastards, cowards and such as put more trust in their heels than in their hands, whom Claudian calleth couragious; and Salust, warl ke, puissant, mighty in armes and feats of warre before the Romanes. Or doth this Victorinus happily interprete thus these words of Caesar? As their courage is forward and ready to enterprise and begin warre, so haue they womanish and faint harts to suffer and endure calamities? or these of Liuy? In the first onset or assault the Gauls are more stout than men, but at last they are more faint-harted than women: or these words of the same authour? Often vse hath proued this to be true; If you can endure and sustaine the first onset, which they make in hot bloud and desperate fury, their bodies faint with sweat and wearinesse, so that they are not able to beare vp their weapons &amp;c. or this in like maner of Flo∣rus? It hath beene found true by experience, that like as their first assault is more than mens, so their last are lesse than womens.</P>
<PB REF="269"/>
<P>They agree in this one property with the snow of their country: for assoone as they are hot in battell, presently they sweat extremely. And if they stirre ne∣uer so little they melt like snow in the Sunne. Or, this of Dion? The Gauls are carried with vnsatiable lust to performe all matters whatsoeuer they go about, in so much that they know no meane either of boldnesse or of feare, but one while they fall of a sudden from boldnesse into fearefulnesse; and by and by from feare into desperate rashnesse. Or this iudgement of Strabo which he giueth of them? It is a warlike and fierce nation, very forward in fight. Therefore being pro∣uoked to battell they fight vpon heapes thronging together and do lie very open: and that very vncircumspectly. Whereby it commeth to passe that they are ea∣sily entrapped, it their enemy vsing but some stratageme, at his best aduantage, doe traine them out to ioine battell, being appointed and armed with nothing beside strength and desperatenesse. Leo the Emperour in his booke <HI>De Bellico apparatu,</HI> determineth of them farre otherwise. The Frenchmen (saith he) are stout of courage, valiant in warre. To be faint harted and to giue ground neuer so little they account a great disgrace, and do esteeme it no better than running a∣way &amp;c. Now then if this nation be so womanish and cowardous, so vnpatient of labour, so vnconstant and vnable to hold out in battell, doe but tell me (O thou Romane) why Cicero in his oration <HI>Pro Prouincijs Consularibus,</HI> did write that this Gallia was so terrible vnto thee? Why did Salust affirme that all Italy did tremble and quake for feare of this people; in so much, that the Romanes did not vse to contend with them for glory and ambition, but only for safegard of their liues and country? How happeneth it, that in Trogus we find these words of the kings of the East? There was so great a terrour of the French name, and of their successe in all warres so prosperous; that these supposed themselues neuer able to keepe either their maiesty out of danger, nor to recouer it againe, being decai∣ed or lost, without the helpe of the French valour and prowesse. And why doth Appian, in his second booke of Ciuill warres, say, that they did strinke such a ter∣rour to the Romanes, that in the law, wherein freedome from seruice in warre was granted to Priests and old men, the French warres were only excepted? So∣sipater, out of Varro his second booke of Antiquities, gathereth, that the Gauls did most ingeniously affect two things, to wit, militarie knowledge, and elo∣quence. From hence is that of Iuuenal: <HI>Gallia ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> potius nutricula cansidicorum.</HI> Whether France should France intituled be or Lawyers nurse I know not certainly. Item in another place: <HI>Gallia causidicos docuit facunda Britannos.</HI> The prating Frenchmen first did teach, The Englishman to plead at barre. Was this true in Iuue∣nals time? or did he rather prophecie of times to come? For this misery our nation neuer felt till the daies of William the First. Columella in his first booke of Husbandrie saith, that <HI>Sine causidicis satis felices olim fuere futurae{que} sunt vrbes.</HI> Saint Ambrose, in his Epistle vnto Rusticus, highly extolleth the most flourishing studies of France; and the copiousnesse of the French tongue; and Claudian in his fourth Panegyricke of the consulship of Honorius, commendeth the learned inhabi∣tants of France. Concerning their warefare take these few things gathered out of ancient writers: and first out of Caesar. This is the maner of the Gals (saith he) when they begin any warres they appoint a generall muster, to which by a common law, all the yong striplings are compelled to come in their armour: and he that commeth last of all, is in the open sight of all the rest, with all kind of most cruell torments, put to death. Out of Strabo: Their armour according to their stature is a long sword hanging on the right side, along target, speares sutable thereunto (which Diodorus reporteth to bee headed with iron, a cubite or some∣what more in length, and little lesse than two handfuls broad) and a kind of iaueling called <HI>Meris,</HI> or rather, as some learned men do affirme, <HI>Materis,</HI> and to bee the same with that kind of weapon which Caesar calleth <HI>Matara.</HI> Some of them also vse bowes and slings. They haue moreouer another weapon of wood in forme of a dart, which they fling not with a thong fastned to the middle, [as the Irishmen at this day vse] but meerly with the bare hand, &amp; yet for all that they will throw it further than an archer can shoote. Nonius out of Varro maketh mention of a kind of weapons, proper to the Frenchmen, called <HI>Gesa,</HI> in these words: <HI>Qui gladijs cincti siue scuto cum binis gesis.</HI> That is, which were armed with swords and bucklers with two Gesaes. Concerning them also Virgil writeth thus: — <HI>Duo Quis{que} Alpina corruscant Gesa manu.</HI> Two Geses weapons which the Frenchmen vse to brandisn did ech party chuse. Seruius in his Comments vpon this place doth interprete them, <HI>Hastas viriles,</HI> manlike speares: and addeth moreouer that valiant souldiers were woont to bee called in the French tongue <HI>Gesi.</HI> But it ought in∣deed to be written with <HI>ae</HI> the dipthong, <HI>Gaesa:</HI> (of which you may see what we haue deliuered in the old mappe of Spaine, or M. Clarencieux Camden his Bri∣tannia, where hee hath learnedly handled this argument, and for this word, amongst the rest, shall satisfie thee to thy fill.) From hence, it may bee, it is that a kind of people there were named <HI>Gaesati,</HI> because they did weare and vse these Geses. Touching which I haue written more at large in my Thesaurus. The foresaid authour affirmeth that their horsemen be better than their footmen: and that these horsemen did vse to come to the field with many carts and great car∣riages. Liuy also and Pomponius Mela do deliuer that they skirmish in chariots and waggons. The same likewise doth Strabo affirme of them, but that he cal∣leth these waggons, <HI>Esseda,</HI> which is all one. Out of these charriots (saith Diodorus) they first throw a dart at their enemy comming against them: then after∣ward forsaking their chariots they fight on foot with their swords. I do vnderstand out of Vegetius that in skirmishes they did vse to fight in troupes and seuerall bands containing in number six thousand armed men apiece. <HI>Cateruas,</HI> he calleth them: Of which word, as also of <HI>Essedum,</HI> see M. Camdens Britannia. They were naked all aboue the nauill, saue only that they couered their bodies, although very meanly god woot, with a long target, which was not broad inough for the largenesse of their bodies, as Liuy and Polybius do testifie. Likewise Gauls were <HI>Scutis protecti corpora longis:</HI> shielded their bodies with long targets, as Virgil reporteth. These targets being about the heigth of a man in length, were, as euery man thought fit, adorned with certaine formes and pictures of liuing creatures, embossed and somewhat bearing out higher than the surface of the target it selfe, as Diodorus writeth: who addeth in another place that they defended or ar∣med their heads with a brasen helmet higher then ordinary, wherein were ingrauen either hornes or portraitures of birds or beasts. The same authour witnesseth that they vsed trumpets in their warres. Their swords saith Polybius, were heauy; and very long, as Liuie writeth, and without points, as Strabo telleth vs: made onely for this purpose, that they might wound the enemie with downe-right blowes: whereupon Virgil, (as Seruius noteth) writeth, <HI>Altè consurgit in ensem,</HI> that is, he lifteth vp his sword on high to giue the greater blow: with which if they did hit, they cut off the heads of their foes at one stroke. Yet notwithstanding these swords were made without art and of a soft kind of iron, as Polyaenus affirmeth in his eigth booke. Wherefore of these same weapons thus gathereth Sui∣das out of Polybius. They are so made that at the first onset they giue one blow, and then presently are so crooked and bended both in length and breadth, that vnlesse you grant them space immediately to retire and to strengthen them with their feet, the next stroke can do no hurt. Diodorus termeth them <HI>Spathae,</HI> and saith that they hang by a brasen chaine on the right side. Neuerthelesse Iulius Pollux commendeth this French sword, calling it by the Greeke name <HI>(machaera.)</HI> Polybius, Strabo and Diodorus do teach that they wore about their neckes gold chaines, (which gaue occasion to Virgil to say —<HI>Lactea colla Auro innectuntur</HI>—. Their lilly white neckes adorn'd with gold.) and about their armes and hands, costly bracelets: and those amongst them that were in place and authority, did weare garments died and garded with gold, (<HI>Atque aurea vestis,</HI> golden garments the French did weare, saith Virgil.) They did adorne, saith Pliny, and set out their swords, shields, and head-peeces with corall. Some of them also saith Diodore, gilded their iron breast-plates. When they go to battell there is among them such singing, howling, showting, dancing, such noise of targets, which they shake after their countrie fashion and the fearefull clattering of armour so great, that all places round about did seeme to ring therewith, as Polybius and Liuy do iointly testifie. Strabo also and Diodorus affirme, that they did fight against the enemie with dogs. Moreouer they carried with them to the wars (if we may beleeue Possidonius in Athenaeus) parasites, whom they would haue to sing songs in their honour and commendation: and indeed the same thing is auouched by Diodorus. If they haue got the vpper hand of their enemies in battell, they are woont to sacrifice their captiues vnto their Gods, as Athenaeus, vpon the testimonie of Sosipater verilie thinketh. When they returne from battell, (heere what Strabo reporteth of them) they hang the heads of their enemies vpon the manes of their horses and set them vp vpon the towne gates, to be viewed and seene of of all men. But the heads of Noblemen, (heare Diodorus) embalmed with spices, they lay vp in cases with the greatest care that may bee; shewing them to strangers, and will not part with them, either to their parents or to any other their friends, for any money. Liuy writeth, that they did offer vp in triumph, the spoiles of dead bodies, and the head being cut off from the body, in their temple, which is held in greatest reuerence amongst them. Afterward, the head being cleansed, as their maner is, they gild the skull, and that they esteeme for an holy vessell, wherein they drinke at solemne feasts and sacrifices. And this is the cup of the Priests and rulers of the temple. Whereupon Silius writeth thus: <HI>At Celtae vacui capitis circumdare Sueti Ossa (nefas) auro &amp; mensis ea pocula seruant.</HI> But this vile custome do the Celtes obserue The heads from carcase of their foes to pull: Which set in gold most curiously they carue, And in steed of cuppes doe quaffe in dead mens scull. Of the ordering of their Horse battell which they call <HI>Trimarcisia,</HI> read Pausanias in his Phocica. Likewise of their <HI>Silodunes,</HI> as Athenaeus, or <HI>Soldures,</HI> (souldiers) as Caesar termeth them, reade these aforenamed authours, and, if you please, ad vnto them those things which Leo the Emperour hath writ∣ten in his eighteenth booke <HI>De Bellico apparatu,</HI> in the eighty and eight section. Now it remaineth that we speake something also of their common maner of liuing. Throughout all Gallia, (saith Caesar) there be but two sorts of men, that are made account of, and had in any great estimation; the one are the <HI>Druides,</HI> the other are their <HI>Knights.</HI> These knights (of the Druides we haue spoken at large in our mappe of Gallia described by Caesar) when need is and when any warre chanceth, giue themselues altogether to feats of armes. And among them, as any man is of greatest birth and ability, so hath he about him more seruants and retainers. The Druides are occupied about holy things: they haue the charge of publike and priuate sacrifices; and do interpret and discusse matters of religion &amp;c. For the communalty is kept vnder in maner like slaues: and the noble men may lawfully deale with them in all points as with their slaues. They do not suffer their sons to come in their presence openly, vntill such time as being men growen, they be able to supply the roomes of souldiers: and they count it a shame, that the sonne as long as he is a boy, should be seene abroad in his fathers company. Looke how much money the men do receiue with their wiues in name of their dowry, they make an estimate of their owne goods and lay so much in valew thereunto: all the which is occupied together in one stocke, and the increase thereof is reserued, and which of them soeuer ouerliueth other, the stocke with the encrease of the former yeares falleth to the suruiuer. The men haue ouer their wiues, like as ouer their children, authority of life and death, &amp;c. Thus much wee haue collected out of the sixth booke of Caesars commentaries, where thou maist reade of many other things to this purpose, well worth the obseruation. Diodorus Siculus affirmeth that their women are very goodly personages, and for bignesse of bone and strength, little inferiour to the men: they are very fruitfull and good nources, or, as Strabo reporteth very good breeders and bringers vp of children. They, as Plutarch in the eigth booke of his Symposion, writeth, did vsually bring, when they went to the bath to wash themselues, together with their children and little ones, the skillet and pappe wherewith they vsed to feed them. A notable example of their worth and valour, thou shalt find in his booke of vertues, where hee sheweth that it grew into a custome amongst them, that both for matters at home in time of peace, and abroad in time of warre, they vsed the counsell and aduise of their wiues, and whatsoeuer was done it was partly done by their appointment. Polyaenus also in his seuenth booke reporteth the very same thing of them. Notwithstanding that their women are most beautifull, yet, as Athenaeus and Diodorus do both affirme, they are much giuen to buggery and to loue boies be∣yond all measure. But whether this be true or not I cannot tell. I would rather beleeue that it was not generally affirmed of all the Gauls; but rather specially of those which did inhabite that part of the countrey which was called Gallia Braccata, where the Massilyans, a people descended from the Greekes, did dwell, whose wantonnesse, and effeminate maners, those adagies or prouerbes cited by Suidas, <HI>Massiliam venis,</HI> and <HI>Massiliam nauiges</HI> do manifestly reproue for this fault. Hither also I do referre that which I haue read in the ninth booke of Clemens his Recognitions, spoken as I suppose vpon this very same occasion: There was an ancient law or custome among the Gauls, saith he, which did ordaine that to a new married man boies should be giuen openly and in the sight of all the compa∣ny, which was accounted no maner of shame or dishonesty amongst them. And I verily thinke that Strabo spake of this their vsage, in these his words: It was held for no maner of vnseemely thing amongst them, if they did commit buggery with yong men of one or two and twenty yeares old. Of the Celtae also this saying of Stobaeus is not to be omitted: where he writeth, that it was a more hainous crime &amp; offence amongst thē more seuerely punished, if one did kil a stranger, than if one should kill one of his owne countrey men: for this was but banishment, the other was death. But was not this thinke you a law only against such mur∣thers as were committed in via Heraclea? Their apparrell they did ordinarily weare, as Strabo testifieth, was a kind of cassocke somewhat like the Spanish cloake (<HI>Saga</HI> it is called of the Latines) of which Virgil in these words maketh mention, <HI>virgatis lucent sagulis:</HI> Trimme they shine in strip'd rugs: They were wouen of a course kind of wooll, and were called in their language <HI>Laenae,</HI> (yet the iudicious Casaubone in his learned commentaries vpon this place of Strabo, thinketh that the place is corrupt, and that we ought rather to reade <HI>Chlenas,</HI> than <HI>Laenas</HI>) They did also weare breeches, (<HI>braccae,</HI> they call them) set out and bumbasted, or loose, as Lucane saith. In steed of coates they vsed a slit sleeued garment which came downe to their twist and buttockes: and as Martiall saith <HI>Dimidias{que} nates Gallica palla tegit:</HI> A curtalled pall the Gauls did weare, that scarce would hide their taile. This kind of garment is still in vse heere in the Low countries, made in the very
<PB REF="270"/> selfe same forme and fashion and is called in our language a <HI>Pallatrocke;</HI> for <HI>Rocke</HI> with the Flemings, is asmuch as <HI>Vestis</HI> in Latine, a weed, or vesture. Aristotle in the seuenth booke of his Politickes, in my iudgement, speaketh of this kind of garment, when he saith that the Gauls did weare a kind of short gabbardine. The forenamed Martiall doth speake of a kind of weed vsed amongst the Gauls which he calleth <HI>Bardocucullus Santonicus,</HI> The hooded cloake of Xantoigne. But Pliny beside these, maketh mention of another kind of vesture vsuall amongst them, in these his words: Wooll of it selfe, driuen together and wrought in maner of a felt, doth make a knid of cloath: and if in the making of it, you do worke it with vineger, it will be so stiffe and solide that you shall not be able to pierce it with the stroake of a sword: this I thinke was first inuented by the Frenchmen. The same authour reporteth that these people did first make that cloth that is damasked with scutcheons or lozēge-work. In Isidorus, out of Plautus these words are cited, <HI>Linnae cooperta est textrino Gallia.</HI> For the sēse of which I refer to the author himself, for the copies of Isidorus are here very corrupt. Diodorus Siculus saith that they did vse to weare rings vpon their fingers: yet Pliny reporteth that they wore them only vpon the middle finger. Caesar testifieth that they tooke pleasure in oxen, and such kind of labouring beasts. Now in like maner we will speake somewhat of their diet and maner of liuing. They vsed in their seruices earthen vessels, very thicke and strong, and goodlily set out with flowres. At supper they generally all of them sit, not vpon stooles, but on the ground vpon woolues skinnes or dogges skinnes spread vpon the same. Strabo saith that at their meat they sit vpon beds or pallades lying vpon the ground. They are serued at their tables with little boies. Hard by them is the fire, where the pots with boiled meats hang see thing, and spits full of roast meat are continually going, as Diodorus reporteth. Their meats for the most part are porke and bacon; yea and sometime they eate anie other kind of flesh whatsoeuer, and that oft times is dressed with milke, as Strabo hath left recorded. But Athenaeus words, which hee citeth out of Posidonius, are worth the noting: The Celtae make their drinkings vpon tables of wood, with a little hay strowed vnderneath; these tables be not very high from the ground. They haue bread, (which, as Pliny writeth, they make light with leauen) but of it they haue no great quantity: their meat is a great deale of flesh sodde in water, broiled vpon the coales, or roast vpon spits. This, when it is brought to the boord, they take vp whole in both their hands, and like rauening lions doe teare it with their teeth: but if there be any of it so tough that they cannot easily gnaw it, that they cut in smaller pieces with a little knife. Their bankets they vse to furnish with all kind of fish, both fresh-fish, sea-fish, and shel-fish, whatsoeuer kind, I meane, that either the fresh riuers, or brackish seas do affoord. These they broile and dresse with salt, vineger and cummin seed, which things also they vse to put into their pots. If many do meet at one table together, they sit round in maner of a circle. The best man alwaies sitteth in the middest: him I terme the best man, that either for martiall prowesse, nobility, or wealth doth excell the rest. The seruitoures, skinkers, or such as do waite at the boord, do carrie drinke to the table in pots like pitchers, either of potters mettall, or else of cleane siluer. Of the same mettall are their dishes and platters, in which they serue in their meat. Yet some of them haue them of brasse: other some in steed of platters do vse ba∣skets, made of twigs or osiers. The wealthier sort do drinke wine brought from Italy, or from the country neere about Marseilles, and that for the most part is of the pure grape, yet sometime they allay it or brew it with a little water: <HI>dercoma,</HI> they call it. They suppe it vp by a little and little out of the same cuppe, being euery foot sipping and bibbing. A boy carrieth about the pot in both his hands. But Pliny testifieth that they made a kind of drink, of steeped corne, so strong that it would make a man drunke. Diodorus Siculus writeth that they had a kind of drinke, which they call <HI>Zythum,</HI> (we now cal it <HI>Ale,</HI> the Britans as Dioscorides testi∣fieth called it <HI>Curmi,</HI> or <HI>Curw</HI> as now the Welchmen pronounce the word.) Item the same authour saith that they made another kind of drink of the water wherein they had washed or sod hony combes, (this now we call <HI>Mead:</HI>) yea and Ammianus Marcellinus saith that they did make and inuent euery day many new kinds of drinke in despite of wine, to counterfet it so neere as they could. I reade also in Diodorus Siculus that they did vse to eate mans flesh. But whether is this to be vnderstood of their enemies flesh only, and of such as they ouercome in battell? For that they did thus at the field fought at Thermopylae, Pausanias doth flatly affirme. Or, whether do you thinke that he so spake of them in regard that they sacrificed men vnto their gods? For this was done, as Pliny reporteth, in such sort, that it was somwhat like as if they had gnawen them. Notwithstanding in Sextus Rufus we reade of the Scordisci Galli, that they vsed to drinke mans bloud, out of the skuls of their enemies which they had conquered in the field. Moreouer Diodorus writeth that they vsed to bid strangers &amp; trauellers to their tables, &amp; after supper or dinner then to ask what they are, wherfore they come, whence they are, and whether they will. They vsed also when they had filled their bellies, fal∣ling into talk vpon any argument as occasion should offer it self, to fal out, and so to rise and challenge one another into the fields, no whit respecting their liues or limmes: and that in this manner, as Posidonius in Athenaeus reporteth: They being armed, saith he, challenge one another to fight aloofe, clashing onely the points of their swords, neuer comming neere there by the length of their weapons, as if they were afraid to hurt one another: yet notwithstanding sometime it falleth out that one of them is hurt; and then except the standers by doe part them, and keepe them a sunder, they will not giue ouer till it hath cost one of them his life: whereupon peraduenture Horace said, <HI>Non pauentis funera Galliae,</HI> And desperate France that fear'th no death. In old time also it was an ancient custome amongst them, that when the quarters and ioints of mutton were set vpon the table, the strongest and tallest man of them would take the legge, which if so be any other would challenge as due to him, and would offer to take it out of his hand, it must cost one of them his life. Others do take vp in the theater gold, or siluer, or a certaine number of hogges-heads of wine: and assoone as they haue bound themselues with an oath that they will endure that, for which they had receiued these gifts: then taking them, and distributing them vnto their most inward and dearest friends, they stretch themselues out straight vpon their backes, and lay them downe vpon their shields, one standing by that is to stabbe them in their throat and cut off their necke with a sword. They lie downe to sleepe on grasse or rushes strowed vpon the ground, as Polybius testifieth: or vpon deares skinnes, as Diodorus recordeth. In the thirteenth booke of Athenaeus, where you shall find these words, in my iudgement, spoken of Braccata Gallia, (They lie vpon skins betweene two Ganimedes:) For I am verily perswaded, and I thinke all wise men with me, that he meant the Grecians of Marseilles, and not the true and ancient Gauls whose maner it was, as before we haue noted out of Iulian the Emperour, that they vsed that act only for the procreation of children. Their houses and habitations, saith Caesar, for the most part were in woods, or vpon the bankes of brookes and riuers, thereby to shelter themselues from the violence of the Sunne, and heat of Sommer: and those, Vitruuius writeth, were made and couered ouer with oken shingles, or else with straw. Strabo affirmeth that they are built in a maner round, of planks and hardles, couered with a great roofe, made taper-wise or sugar loafe fashion: this roofe, as Pliny writeth, was of stubble. Their gates, if we may beleeue Nicolaus in Stobaeus, did continually stand open. Iulianus the Emperour, in his Misopogonus, relateth a tale, whereby we gather that they had the vse of hot-houses or stoues, such as still to this day are v∣sed in some places of this countrie. Villages they haue, as Polybius noteth, without any wals or rampart for defence against the assault of the enemies: For Tro∣gus reporteth that they learned of them of Marseilles, to enclose their townes with wals and ramparts. The maner of building and fashion of which wals thou maist vnderstand out of the seuenth booke of Caesars commentaries: where moreouer thou shalt find this that followeth: when any great or notable mat∣ter falleth out they giue notice of it through the fields and countries by lowd cries or proclamations one vnto another, and so still forwards, like vnto our hue and cries, vntill it stay at the outmost border of the kingdome. Ammianus in his fiue and twentieth booke saith that they gaue themselues much to swimming. In hunting, as I gather out of Cornelius Celsus, they were woont to strike the deere with a venomed arrow. Item Aulus Gellius out of Pliny citeth these words of the same argument: The Gauls when they went on hunting, were woont to dippe their arrow heads in the iuice of hellebore, verily beleeuing that the flesh of such deere as were stroken and killed with them, was farre more tender than otherwise it would be: but by reason of the venome of the hellebore, they say they did vse to cut off round about, a great deale of the flesh where the arrow went in. Item Pliny also maketh mention of the hearb <HI>limeum,</HI> wherewith they made a kind of ointment, which they call <HI>venenum ceruarium,</HI> Hart-poison, with which in hunting they do besmeare their arrowes. Aristotle in his <HI>Admiranda,</HI> sheweth that amongst the Celtae there is a kind of poison found, called by them <HI>Toxicum,</HI> (the Latine interpreter did read <HI>Xenicum,</HI> that is, strange) which infecteth and kil∣leth so speedily, that the hunters of that country when they haue stricken a deere with an arrow dipped in the iuice of this herb, they runne with all speed, and do presently cut out all that flesh neere round about where the arrow went in, lest the venome spreading it selfe further and further, the whole deere should putrifie and so be marred and good for nothing &amp;c. Pliny maketh me beleeue that this confection or poison was made of the yeugh-tree (<HI>taxus,</HI> they call it) where hee saith that those poisons, which we now call <HI>toxica,</HI> wherewith they did besmere their arrowes, were sometimes called <HI>taxica.</HI> Of the poison and venemous na∣ture of the yeugh-tree, we haue entreated before. But there was a tree which grew amongst the Celtae much like vnto a figge-tree, whose fruit that it bare, was fashioned like vnto the chapter of the Corinthiacke pillar. This fruit being cutte doth yeeld a iuice, wherein if any man shall dippe his arrowes, whatsoeuer hee shall strike therewith, will presently die of that wound, as Strabo affirmeth from the report of others. That the Gauls did not feare the danger of Earth-quakes, Aristotle and Plutarch do plainlie testifie. But whether it be true or false, I dare not affirme. Another notable example (except one should thinke it to be a feined and forged tale) of great boldnesse or rather of desperate rashnesse, I find in Aelianus his <HI>varia historia,</HI> which is thus: They do account it, saith he, so fowle and shamefull a thing to flie or runne away, that oft times they will make no hast to get from vnder houses that they see are ready to fall vpon their heads, nay they will hardly out of those houses that are on fire, so that many times they be burnt to ashes in the flame. Many of them also will stand still vntill the waues and tide of the sea do runne quite ouer them. Moreouer some of them will cast themselues into the sea in their armour, and with their swords drawne, and shaking of their speares, daren the tide, as if they could either fraie or wound the same. Let the credulous Iew beleeue this, if he will, I beleeue neuer a word of it, although I know that Stobaeus, and before him Nicolaus, did verily beleeue it all to be true. Heere I do by experience find, that saying of Pliny to be very true, that There is hardly any greater disparagement to the truth, than when a false told is told by a graue authour. But may not one thinke, that I may requite one tale with another, that this was that sight, which Lucian in his Apologia writeth, that his friend Sabinus went as farre as the West ocean to see? Their funerals according to their maner and state are very gorgeous and costly: all things that the dead men in their life time did especially loue and affect, yea euen such liuing creatures as they best estee∣med, were cast into the fire and burnt: and not long since, within the memory of our forefathers, euen their seruants and followers, whom they loued extraor∣dinarily well, when all ceremonies of the funerall were done, were cast into the fire and burnt together with their Masters or Mistresses; thus Caesar reporteth of them. To this Pomponius Mela addeth, That with the dead they burne and burie in the ground all things that they commonly vsed when they were aliue: their accoumpts and debts were deferred till doomes day. Some there were of them which would willingly cast themselues into the fires and graues of their friends, verily perswading themselues that they should still liue together with them: Item Diodorus Siculus reporteth, that some of them would cast into the fire where their friends deceased were burnt to ashes, their letters, verily beleeuing that they would reade them there: For that opinion of Pythagoras, of the immortality of the soule, had taken footing and deepe root amongst them: being perswaded that afterward, the bodies being dead, in processe of time they should againe returne into other bodies. Listen also what Valerius Maximus saith of this matter: It was an ancient custome saith he, amongst the Gauls, as old records do verifie, vsu∣ally to lend money in this world, to be paid againe in the world to come. Which the forenamed authour termeth <HI>Philosophiam foeneratoriam,</HI> A couetous or mi∣serly kind of Philosophie, practised then by some vsurers. But can you tell where now a man may borrow an hundred pounds, vpon good security, till that day? I doubt whether there be any pale-faced cut-throat vsurer, glorious smooth-tongued gold-smith, crafty mocke-lawyer Scriuener, or any rag-merchant broker, in this our city, that was euer Pythagoras scholler. This Iewish sect are all, I thinke by their practise, of the opinion of the Sadduces, who thought and taught that there was no resurrection of the soule to be expected after this life. It is no wonder or strange matter to thinke that the Gauls were of this opinion, if so bee that be true, that one Alexander in Clemens Alexandrinus doth tell of, namely, that Pythagoras did trauell into France. Tertullian out of Nicander doth write that they vsed to he abroad all night vpon the graues and tombes of valiant men: and there to expect the answeare of some of oracle. I care not an halfe penny for that opinion of the great Orateur Tully, in that his oration which he made for Marcus Fonteius, where he writeth that The Gauls are hardly addicted to follow any religion at all: For Liuy, although in other things he be partiall and dealeth hardly with this nation, yet he plainly affirmeth that they be not very backeward in religion: And Caesar, in his seuenth booke of the warres of France, who throughly well knew this people, saith, that they were much giuen to religion, and seruice of some god or other. Item he saith, That they did especially worship god Mercury, of whom there were amongst them many images and statues, they affirming him to be the authour and inuentour of all arts and sciences: him also they hold to be their guide and leader in all iourneies and waies through which they are to trauell: him they supposed to haue a great power and stroke in all maner of trafficke and gainfull trade for money: to him they offered mans flesh in sacrifice, as Minutius Felix writeth. Besides him they did also worship Apollo, Mars, Iupiter and Minerua. Of these their gods they held the very same opinion,
<PB REF="270"/> that other nations of the world did: viz. That Apollo being praied vnto, did driue away all diseases. Minerua first taught the grounds of all arts and occupations: Iupiter, did rule and moderate the motion of the heauens: Mars, was president and guardian of the warres: That the Celtae did honour Iupiter, whose image or statue was a most goodly tall oake, Maximus Tyrius doth plainly testifie. Of Mercury heare what Pliny in the seuenth chapter of his fowre and thirtieth doth write: Zenodorus, saith he, in our time did in the city Clermont or Auvergne (<HI>Aruerniae,</HI> the ancients called it) make the greatest and most gorgeous statue that euer was made in the world: who there for tenne yeares together working vpon the statue of Mercury, had for his hire H S. CCCC. that is, as some men reade it, fowre hundred thousand sestertioes; which do amount in our money to 3333. pounds, sixe shill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs and eight pence. Strabo doth testifie that Diana, the E∣phesian Goddesse, had a temple at Marseils. Item, Polyaenus witnesseth, that the French-greekes <HI>(Gallo-graeci)</HI> did worship Diana: which Plutarch, in his booke of the Fortitude of women, doth auouch to be true. But beside this Diana, they worship another by them sirnamed <HI>Arduenna,</HI> as is verified by an ancient inscrip∣tion in marble, of which we shall speake more anone. This goddesse by all probability seemeth to haue beene worshipped in the forrest Arduenna. For although it be there written DEANAE ARDVENNAE, yet I thinke there is no man meanly seene and trauelled in ancient inscriptions, that is ignorant that by it is meant <HI>Dianae Arduennae:</HI> For the ancient Romanes did oft times vse <HI>I,</HI> for <HI>E,</HI> and contrariwise <HI>E,</HI> for <HI>I,</HI> as the learned can beare me witnesse. And in honour of her was this forrest Arduenna consecrated and made holy, or rather as I thinke heere was some temple erected and dedicated to her seruice, built either by the an∣cient Gauls, so deuout and religiously giuen, as before is shewed, or, if you like that better, by the Romanes themselues, as in the greatest and most renowmed forest or wood within the compasse of their whole Empire, a place most worthy and best beseeming this goddesse. And what maruell I pray you? being, I say, a place most fit and conuenient for this goddesse Diana, to inhabite and make her abode in? For she is called of all ancient heathen writers <HI>Venatrix, Nemoralis, Nemorum &amp; syluarum Dea, virgo &amp; custos;</HI> The goddesse of hunting, the goddesse of the woods, chases and forests; and the maiden keeper of the same: Lactantius, Lucane and Minutius Felix do affirme that they had three gods which they in their language called <HI>Esus,</HI> or <HI>Hesus, Teutates,</HI> and <HI>Taranus:</HI> But the learned, for the most part, by them do vnderstand Mars, Mercury and Iupiter: See M. Camdens Britannia. In Ausonius there is mention made of a god of theirs which they na∣med <HI>Belenus:</HI> whom Herodian, by the iudgement of the learned Iulius Scaliger, calleth <HI>Belis:</HI> And whether this be the same with <HI>Tibilenus,</HI> whereof Tertullian maketh mention, Petrus Pithaeus in his Aduersaria doth most learnedly dispute; and doth there interprete it to be the same that Apollo is to the Greekes. More∣ouer <HI>Abellio</HI> was one of their gods, as the forenamed Scaliger, at the same place, out of an ancient inscription, doth teach vs. The same authour also maketh men∣tion of <HI>Onuana,</HI> a goddesse of theirs. Saint Austen, in his bookes of the city of God, doth affirme that they had certaine vncleane spirits or diuels, called by them <HI>Dusij,</HI> in the catalogue and number of their gods. But whether they did worship the god <HI>Serapis,</HI> (the same peraduenture with Pluto) the aboue-mentioned P. Pi∣thaeus, out of certaine words, of the sixteenth booke of Ammianus Marcellinus his history, doth in the third chapter of his Aduersaria, at large and learnedly di∣scourse: to whom I referre thee for farther satisfaction. Out of Florus also we learne that they worshipped <HI>Vulcane</HI> for a god: who writeth that they did promise to giue him the armour and weapons of the Romanes their enemies. Athenaeus saith that they turned their faces toward the right-hand when they did their ser∣uice to their gods. Of this matter, Plinie in the second chapter of his eight and twentieth booke, writeth thus: In worshipping of the gods wee offer to kisse the right hand, and withall we wind and sway about the whole body: which the Gauls did hold to be more religious, if it were done toward the left hand. To these they did offer in their sacrifices, men and other things, but especially vnto Mars, as Caesar testifieth, who thus writeth of them: To him, (namely to Mars) when they haue fought any battell, for the most part they do bequeath those things that they haue wonne in the field: those beasts and liuing creatures that they conquere and take they kill and offer them for sacrifice: all other things whatsoeuer they bring into one place: In diuers cities, in certaine holy and conse∣crated places, you may see great heapes of these things: and you shall hardly euer find any man so backward in religion or so vngodly, that either will hide and conceale such things as he hath gotten in the field, or that will dare to take away ought that hath beene once consecrated and laid vp in those sacred and religious places: and if so be that any man be either so prophane, or hardly that dareth take ought away, he is to bee punished, by their lawes, with most cruell tortures. Diodorus Siculus reporteth the very like of them, They doe keepe, in the chappels and temples of their gods, saith he, great store of gold, which hath from time to time beene offered to them, lying scattering heere and therein euery corner: and yet no one man for his life, (such is their great superstition) dareth bee so bold as to touch one piece of it. But Caesar goeth on forward in the same discourse: They, saith he, which are sicke or much diseased, and such as are in any great danger, or are to follow the warres, for their sacrifices do either kill and offer other men, or else doe vow hauing obtained their purpose to sacrifice themselues: and in these their ceremonies they doe vse the aduise, direction and assistance of the Druides: And this they doe for this reason: namely, for that they doe verily beleeue that for the life of man preserued, the immortall gods can no way be satisfied and pleased but with the life and bloud of man: And therdfore for that pur∣pose they haue certaine sacrifices appointed to be publickly solemnized and done. Others haue certaine images of an huge and mighty bignesse: whose limmes and parts of the body, being made of osiers wreathen and roddled one within another, they fill full of liue men; these images being set on fire, the men within them are smoothered and at length with them burnt and vtterly consumed to ashes. The death and punishment of such as are apprehended for murther, or fello∣ny, or any other odious crime, they thinke to be much more pleasing to the gods, than the death and sacrifice of other men: but when there do want a sufficient number of such wicked men to furnish this tragedy, then honest guiltlesse men must be forced to play a part, and to vndergoe that punishment that they neuer de∣serued. Thus farre Caesar. The same almost, but much different in words, Strabo doth write of them: Some, saith hee, in their diuine ceremonies they shoot through with arrowes, or else doe hang them vp by the neckes till they be dead: and then making an huge colossus or stacke of hay, and sticking vpright a long pole in the midst of it, they burne altogether, sheepe and all kind of beasts and cattell, yea and reasonable creatures, men and women. Item Diodorus Siculus writeth of this matter thus: Condemned men, which they keepe for the space of fiue yeares together continually bound to a stake, at length together with other goods and cattels they sacrifice and burne in an huge bonne-fire. Minutius Felix also doth testifie, that to their god Mercurie they did vse to sacrifice men. Ter∣tullian in Apologetico, saith, that <HI>Maior aetas, Mercurio prosecatur,</HI> The ancienter sort are hewed in pieces and sacrificed to Mercury. So, that, it had beene much better for the Gauls, as Plutarch in his booke of Superstition, writeth, that they had neuer had any maner of knowledge of the gods at all, then to haue beleeued that they might no otherwise be pleased and satisfied, then with the liues and bloud of mortall men: and to thinke that this is the best and only solemne sacrifice and oblation that euer was vsed by any. Solinus also plainly affirmeth that this kind of sacrifice and detestable custome, was no maner of worship and seruice pleasing to the gods, but rather a great iniurie and wrong done to religion, much offending them. This custome of killing of men, was not vsed only when they offered sacrifices to their gods, but euen in their diuinations and sorceries. For they tooke those men that were appointed for the sacrifice or ceremonies, and striking them vpon the backe, by the panting of their bodies, they did gesse and diuine of the euent of that action intended, as Strabo doth witnesse of them. When they do deliberate or consult of any great matter, they do obserue, saith Diodorus, a woonderfull and strange kind of custome and ceremonious superstiti∣on. For going about to kill and sacrifice a man they strike him vpon the midriffe with a sword. But without the aduice and presence of one of their Druides, they may not offer any maner of sacrifice at all. And although that these butcherings and massacres of men were forbidden by Tiberius Caesar, as Pliny testifieth, yet Eusebius in his fourth booke de Praepar. Euang. doth greatly lament that they were still practised in his time, who liued, as all men know, in the daies of Constan∣tine the Great. It is recorded by Pliny, that these people did vse, in their sorceries, coniurations and answering to demands in maner of prophesying, the hearb verueine. And thus much of the three Galliaes in generall. Of which thou maist reade many other things in Caesar, Liuy, Ammianus, Strabo, Diodorus, Poly∣bius and Athenaeus. Something also might haue beene said of euery part particularly, if so bee that the smalnesse of this sheet, had beene capable of so large a di∣scourse: as also much might haue beene said of Gallia Narbonensis, the fourth part, which was a prouince of the Romanes, much differing from the other three in nature of soile, temperature of the aire, and quality of the inhabitants and people; which was, as Pomponius Mela writeth, better manured, inhabited, and more fertile, and therefore was also a farre more pleasant and goodly countrie than any of the rest. But of this we haue spoken in another place, apart by it sesfe. Behold the inscription, which we spake of before, and promised to acquaint thee withall. DIS. MANIBVS. Q. CAESIVS. Q. F. CLAVD.

<HEAD>IVLIVS CAESARS GALLIA: That is, FRANCE, as it stood in Iulius Caesars <HI>time.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>O I intitle this Mappe: For it is merely <HI>Caesars,</HI> that is, portraitured and drawen only by that which he hath layd downe in his Commentaries: we haue not added one word or any one place out of any other author: neither haue we, to our knowledge, omitted any place there mentioned by him: Thus much I thought good to aduertise thee of, gentle Reader, lest in vaine thou shouldest in this Map seeke for those things which other ancient writers haue written of <HI>Gallia.</HI> Of the nature of the country &amp; people there inhabiting, I will not in like maner, which otherwise I vse to do, adde to these any one word out of any other wri∣ter: because euery one that listeth may do this out of <HI>Caesar</HI> alone, which is an authour very common, and to be found ordi∣narily in euery scholars study. For why should I do this out of others, when as the Map is only framed out of him? But in sted of this I thinke it not amisse here to compose this discourse following of the <HI>Druides,</HI> selected out of all ancient historians.</P>
<P><HI>Caesar</HI> in his sixth booke of the warres of <HI>France</HI> hath left recorded, that in <HI>France</HI> there were two sorts of men which were in estimation and credit aboue the common sort: One of these, sayth he, were the <HI>DRVIDES,</HI> the other were the <HI>KNIGHTS, (Equites.) Strabo</HI> nameth these three, the <HI>Bardi, Vates</HI> (Prophets) and <HI>Druides:</HI> like as <HI>Lucane</HI> doth in these verses, <HI>Laudibus in longum VATES dimittitis aeuum: Plurima securi fudistis carmina BARDI: Et vos Barbaricos ritus morém{que} si∣nistrum Sacrorum DRVIDAE &amp;c.</HI> You <HI>Vates</HI> graue, of worthy men long tales do tell: For rymes and verse you carelesse <HI>Bardi</HI> eke do beare the bell. Of barbarous rites in things diuine you holy <HI>Druides</HI> write &amp;c. <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> affirmeth the same, but that those which <HI>Lucane</HI> calleth <HI>Vates,</HI> he nameth <HI>Eubages. Diodorus Siculus</HI> maketh mention of the <HI>Bardi</HI> &amp; <HI>Druides</HI> only; but the latter sort he calleth <HI>Saronides,</HI> by another &amp; diuers name, yet of the same sense and signification. <HI>Pliny</HI> seemeth often times to terme them generally by one name <HI>Magi. Lucianus</HI> in <HI>Hercules Ogmios</HI> calleth them <HI>Philosophers.</HI> So much of the name: now somewhat of the persons themselues. The <HI>KNIGHTS, (equites)</HI> sayth <HI>Caesar,</HI> when need requireth, and any occasion of warre falleth out, do all go to warfare: and euery one of them, as he is of greater birth or reuenues, so he hath a greater retinue and number of ser∣uants attendant vpon him. Other honour and dignity than this they know none. The <HI>BARDI</HI> are Poets, as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> ioyntly testifie, and did vsually sing songs and hymnes made in the commendations of famous and worthy men. They are musicall Poets, which do sing to the harpe or other instru∣ments of musicke, songs to the praise and commendations of some, and to the dispraise and disgrace of others. <HI>Festus Pompeius</HI> also affirmeth that these men did vsually sing ballads made in commendations of the valiant acts of worthy men; and withall he saith that <HI>Bardus,</HI> in the Gauls language, signifieth a Singer. <HI>Marcellinus</HI> of these Poets speaketh on this maner: The <HI>Bardi</HI> did vse to sing to the harpe, in very sweet &amp; pleasant tunes, songs composed in heroicall verse, of the valiant acts of martiall men. In <HI>Strabo</HI> I obserue that these are called <HI>Vates,</HI> (Prophets) and did vse to offer sacrifice, and to study naturall philosophy. <HI>Ammianus</HI> (who termeth them <HI>Eubages</HI>) writeth thus of them: These men searched deeply into the secrets of Nature, and laboured to lay them open and plaine. The learned <HI>Petrus Pithoeus</HI> thinketh that all these words, <HI>Bardi, Vates, Eubages, Semnothei,</HI> and <HI>Saronides,</HI> are but synonymes of the <HI>Drui∣des.</HI> And for that I see whatsoeuer of diuers writers are attributed to all these seuerally, doe agree to that one of the Druides only, (as is very apparent by that which followeth) I am easily drawen to be of his opinion.</P>
<P>The <HI>DRVIDES</HI> therefore or <HI>Druidae,</HI> (for in good authours I finde it thus diuersly written) were, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> saith, Philosophers and Diuines. <HI>Caesar</HI> sayth that their discipline and maner of learning was first found out and inuented in <HI>England,</HI> which also <HI>Tacitus</HI> in the <HI>14</HI> booke of his Annals shew∣eth and auoucheth to be true, and withall affirmeth that from thence it was translated into <HI>France,</HI> and that they that desired to be more skilfull in the same, for the most part went thither to schoole to be better instructed. But let vs describe them out of <HI>Caesars</HI> owne words, for no man hath done it more plainly, no man knew them better: They are present at diuine seruice, they prouide the sacrifices both publike and priuate, they expound the articles of their religion and do shew the vse of their ceremonies: To these great troups of youth, of all sorts, do flocke from all quarters, to be instructed in any matter of learning: these men are greatly esteemed and honoured of all men; for they doe end and determine almost all maner of controuersies, both priuate and publike: whatsoeuer is committed amisse against right and reason, whether it be of any murther that is done, or of any quarrell arising about any title of inheritance, succession or bounds of land betweene neighbour and neighbour, they do decide the controuersie; they do set and appoint all rewards and boones for such as haue deserued well of the state, and likewise punishments for such as are malefactours, and haue in ought offended the law. If there be any man whatsoeuer, whether it be one priuate man, or a whole multitude and society, that will not stand to their arbitrement, they presently suspended him from their sacrifices: this punishment amongst them is esteemed the greatest that may be inflicted vpon any man. They vse not to follow the warres, neither do they pay customes and subsidies as o∣ther men do. They are freed and priuiledged from the warres, and from any imposition and taske whatsoeuer. Whereupon (moued thereto by so many great inducements, liberties and immunities) many of their owne heads do go to them to schoole, others are sent thither by their parents and kinsfolke: there they are said to learne &amp; con by heart an infinite number of verses; so that some of them do stay at schoole twenty yeres at least, before they can attaine to the height of that knowledge. Neither do they hold it lawfull to commit those things to writing, when as almost in all other matters, both in priuate and publike businesses they do vse the Grecke letters. This they seeme to me, to haue done for two causes: First for that they would not haue that kind of learning to be made common and to come into the hands of the vulgar sort: Secondarily, because they would not haue those which learne, to trust too much to their bookes, and so by that meanes not to regard their memories so much as they ought to do: for indeed for the most part it falleth out, that those which relie too much vpon the helpe of their booke, do learne more loosely and negligently, and withall do dull and greatly weaken their memories. This is the first thing that they would beat into their scholars heads, namely, That the soules of men are immortall; that they do not die together with the body, but that after death they do passe from one to ano∣ther: and this they thinke to be a great inducement (by neglecting the feare of death) to moue their minds to follow vertue and true magnanimity. Moreouer they dispute of, and teach to the yong frie, their scholars, many things of the starres and their motion; of the compasse and greatnesse of the world and earthly globe; of the nature of all things vnder the cope of heauen; and of the might and power of the immortall gods. Thus far <HI>Caesar.</HI> But for thy farther instru∣ction, we will to these adioine that which other men haue written of the same. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> thus speaketh of them: These men do professe themselues to know the compasse of the world and greatnesse of the earthly globe; the motions of the heauens and radiant starres both fixed and planetary: yea to know what the gods themselues do know and do. They teach the nobility, and better sort of men of their nation, many things for twenty yeeres together, secretly in caues or thicke woods and forests. One thing, of all other that they haue taught them in secret, is blazed abroad amongst the common people; namely, to make them the more fit for the warres; That the soules of men are immortall, and that there is another life after this amongst the ghosts. In <HI>Marcellinus</HI> I reade this of them: The <HI>Druidae,</HI> men of more lofty spirits and deepe conceits, much addicted to brother like meetings, are giuen to the study and speculation of hidden and high matters: and contemning the world, do peremptorily affirme that the soules of men are immortall. <HI>Diogenes Laërtius</HI> writeth that they vsed to vtter their opinions of the mysteries of their arte very obscurely in few words and short sentences: <HI>videlicet:</HI> That God is to be worshipped: That we ought to doe nothing that is euill: and, That we must exercise our selues in feats of armes and true fortitude. But let vs heare what <HI>Strabo,</HI> in the fourth booke of his Ge∣ography, reporteth of them: The <HI>Druidae,</HI> saith he, beside their earnest study of naturall philosophy, do dispute many things of the Ethicks or morall vertues. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>en had a reuerend opinion of them for their seuere iustice: insomuch that both priuate and publike execution of iustice was committed to them alone: yea and sometime two armies being in the field ready to ioyne battell, they haue by their mediation made peace betweene them: but especially the cases of mur∣ther are committed to their censure. And being found true by experience, that they haue alwayes the greatest crops and store of fruits, they do verily beleeue, that these men can obtaine at Gods hand plenty and fertility at their pleasure. These, and also the other, haue determined, that the soule of man, and the hea∣uens or world, are both immortall: yet so as that the time shall come, that sometime the fire and sometime the water shall haue the victory and vpper hand. Out of <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> take this obseruation of them: They do moreouer vse soothsayers, which, saith he, amongst them, foretelling things to come by di∣uination and sacrifices, are of great estimation and account, all the vulgar sort and common people being at their obedience and command. When they consult of any great matters, they do obserue a very wonderfull and strange course: for they, for that purpose killing a man, do strike him with a sword vpon the mid∣riffe; and by his fall tearing and scattering of the parts of his body, and running of the blood, by a certaine old experiment and obseruation, do know what will fall out hereafter. It is an ancient custome duely kept amongst them, that no sacrifice may be done without the presence of a Philosopher: for they doe thinke that sacrifice ought only to be done by such as well knew the nature of heauenly things: as if these were indeed the true and best interpreters of the heauenly language vsed of the gods themselues: and by their intercession and mediation they deeme all good things to be sought and demanded at Gods hand. By their adui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and counsell, they do all things that are done, either in war or time of peace. Of this their slaying of a man, the forenamed <HI>Strabo</HI> in the seuenth booke of his Geography maketh m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntion where he calleth them <HI>Vates.</HI> Poets are amongst them of such account, that when the field is pitcht &amp; their swords drawen, hauing ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> armies are ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to handy blowes, not only their friends, but euen also their enemies and the aduers part, at their intreaty and meditation do leaue off fighting, and will not off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to strike one stroke more.

<PB REF="274"/> and <HI>Mars</HI> doth reuerence the Muses. Thus far <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> Now let vs in like maner listen to <HI>Dion Prusaeus,</HI> who thus reporteth of them: The <HI>Cel∣tae</HI> haue their <HI>Druides,</HI> a sort of men amongst them much giuen to diuination and the study of Philosophy, without whose aduice and counsell it is not lawfull for their kings to doe ought, yea or once to goe about to consult what is best to be done: so that if a man should indeed speake that which is trueth, they rule as kings, and beare all the sway: when as their kings are but the seruants, ministers, or executioners of their will and pleasure, although otherwise they sit in golden thrones, dwell in great and stately houses, and dayly fare most daintily, and eat and drinke of the best that may be bought for money. Here also it is not amisse to alledge that of the Poet <HI>Lu∣cane: Et vos barbaricos ritus morem{que} sinistrum Sacrorum Druidae positis repetistis ab armis. Solis noste Deos, &amp; coeli numina vobis, Aut solis nescire datum. nemora alta remotis Incolitis lucis, vobis autoribus vmbrae Non tacitas Erebi sedes, Ditisque profundi Pallida regna petunt, &amp;c.</HI> Ouer all these Druides, as <HI>Caesar</HI> testifieth, there is one that is placed as chiefe, and hath a command and authority ouer the rest: after his death, if any man amongst them excelleth the rest for his worth and vertue, he is by and by chosen to succeed in his place: but if there be many that are of equall value and dignity, then he is elected by the grea∣ter number of voices of the Druides assembled together for that purpose. Sometime the controuersie is such as they fall to blowes about, and that souereignty is tried by dint of sword. They, once a yeere, vpon a certaine time, in the confines of Chartraine or Chartres <HI>(Carnutes)</HI> (neere the riuer <HI>Leire,</HI> if one may giue any credit to the comedy called <HI>Querulus,</HI> which goeth vnder the name of <HI>Plautus,</HI>) which is accounted to be the middle prouince of all <HI>France,</HI> do meet and keepe court as it were in a place consecrated to that purpose: hither do come all such as haue any controuersies from all quarters round about: euery man referring his cause to their hearing, and being content to stand to their arbrurement and censure. (In Chartraine to this day, a certeine memoriall &amp; note of the name <HI>Druides</HI> doth seeme to remaine, in a place called <HI>Dreux.) Gabriel Simeon</HI> in his <HI>Caesar</HI> newly reuiued, (<HI>Caesar renouatus,</HI> a worke of his so intitled) writeth that he hath seene, in a forest of this tract, a mention of an olde plot of the palace of the <HI>Druides.</HI> And thus much of these Druides, whose arte magicke and custome of killing of men, <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth did continue euen vnto his time, and withall addeth that it was abrogated, and they forbidden to vse it any more, by proclamation from <HI>Tiberius Caesar. Suetonius</HI> in <HI>Claudius</HI> aff rmeth that it was first inhabited by <HI>Augustus,</HI> yet not generally, but to the citizens: and was at length vtterly taken away by the sayd <HI>Claudius:</HI> wich also <HI>Seneca</HI> in his treatise intituled <HI>Claudij ludus,</HI> doth auouch to be true. Yet notwithstanding the name of the Druides was not then cleane extinct, as <HI>Tacitus,</HI> in the fourth booke of his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>storie, plainly sheweth: where he writeth, that by the burning of the Capitoll, which hapned in the reigne of <HI>Vespatian,</HI> the Druides in vaine made men beleeue was signified that the possession and command of the whole world should now come vnto the nations inhabiting beyond the Alps. <HI>Aelius Lampridius</HI> writeth, that <HI>Alexander Seuerus</HI> the Emperour going to warre against the <HI>Galli,</HI> a woman Druide cried out in the Gauls language with a loud voice, Thou goest into the field, but looke not to get the victory, trust not thy souldiers, they will faile thee. Neither was she deceiued, for in those warres he was slaine. <HI>Flauius Vopiscus</HI> re∣porteth, that <HI>Aurelianus</HI> asked counsell of the women Druides of <HI>France</HI> about his Empire, whether it should remaine vnto his posterity, or not. The same authour testifieth, that when <HI>Diocletianus</HI> was yet but a priuate souldier, it was at <HI>Tongeren</HI> foretolde him by a Druide woman, that he should one day be Emperour of the whole world. Neither is there after him any mention of them in any history, to my remembrance, except one should straine that of <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his fourth booke <HI>De Proepar.</HI> (for he liued in the time of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great and <HI>Constance</HI> his sonne) where he writeth that the Celtae euen to his time, did sacrifice men vpon their altars. <HI>Pliny</HI> noteth this of the Druides, that there is nothing which they do esteeme more holy than misselto, (which they call <HI>dryos hyphear</HI>) and so likewise they account of the tree vpon which it groweth, especially if it be an oke: They chose, sayth he, groues of these trees apart by themselues, neither do they any diuine seruice or sacrifice without a branch of this tree: so that they may very well be thought to be called <HI>Druidae,</HI> of the Greeke word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>an oke,</HI> as one would say, <HI>Oke-priests.</HI> And indeed whatsoeuer groweth vpon these trees, they do verily beleeue it to be sent downe from heauen; and that it is a manifest signe that God hath chosen this tree, and sanctified it to himselfe. They call it in their language <HI>All-heale.</HI> The sacrifices and bankets being duely prepared and set ready vnder this tree, they bring two white bulles, whose hornes were neuer bound before. The Priest putting on a white garment, getteth vp into the tree ordeined for that seruice, and with a golden hooke pruneth and loppeth off all the boughs. These are caught in a white vesture, like a souldiers cassocke, before they come to the ground. Next after this they kill the buls prepared for the sacrifice, and withall make their prayers to God that he would blesse that his gift to the good of euery one that he there did vouchsafe to giue it. They are persuaded that what beast soeuer, though otherwise barren, shall drinke of a potion made of it, shall presently become fruitfull: and that it is a most soueraigne anti∣dote against all maner of poison whatsoeuer. The same authour in the <HI>3.</HI> chap. of his <HI>29.</HI> booke, telleth a strange tale of a serpents egge, which he affirmeth he saw ex∣perimented and prooued before his face: I my selfe, sayth he, haue seene one of these egges, which was about the bignesse of a prety round apple, couered with a gristly or cartilaginous shell, indented with many concauities like vnto the hollow places wherein the legs of the fish called a polypus do rest: This is the armes or cognisance of the Druides. It is wonderfully commended of them to be a great and secret experiment against all maner of contentions and brawles, procuring him that beareth it the vp∣per hand, as also the fauour and easie accesse to princes and great states, &amp;c. Item, he recordeth that the Druides did first manifest vnto the world that the herbe Sa∣uin had an especiall vertue against all dangers &amp; pernicious accidents which ordinarily betide mortall men. Moreouer, they gather, with the left hand fasting, neuer loo∣king behinde them, an herbe which they call <HI>Samolus,</HI> and affirme it, as he testifieth, to be a soueraigne remedy against all diseases of hogs or swine. The same authour speaketh thus of another herbe called <HI>Selago:</HI> like vnto this herbe sauine is that which they call selago: it must not be cut vp with any knife or instrument of iron, but must be gathered with the right hand wrapped in the skirt of his coat, which must be rent off with the left hand, as if he came to steale it: he that doth this feat must be clad in a white garment, barefooted, but so as his feet be very cleane washed and cleered from all filth: he must first offer sacrifice with bread and wine, before he ga∣ther it: lastly, it must be caried home in a new napkin. This herbe thus gathered the Druidae of the Gauls do hold to be a great preseruatiue and defensatory against all dangerous accidents and occurrences that vsually happen to mortall men: moreouer they affirme that the fume thereof is good against all diseases of the eies. Such is the woonderfull superstition of many nations in the world, and that for the most part in friuolous and foolish things, as the same <HI>Pliny</HI> witnesseth at the <HI>44.</HI> chapter of his <HI>26.</HI> booke. He that is desirous to know more about the etymologie of the name of the <HI>Druides,</HI> let him repaire to <HI>Goropius</HI> his <HI>Gallica,</HI> where he fetcheth this name from a Dutch word, and proueth that it signifieth a teacher of truth, or a wiseman continually busied in the diligent search of the same. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> also maketh them to be <HI>Magistros sapientiae,</HI> teachers and informers of others in Philosophy and all maner of humane wisdome. I could be content to say that the word should signifie a Diuine or student in the knowledge of God and heauenly things, (as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> calleth them) for that I do see that <HI>Druthin,</HI> in the old Germaine tongue, doth signifie God: and that in <HI>Otfrides</HI> gospels, a booke imprinted and to be had in diuers mens studies, especially such as are louers of antiquities: and besides that I know that the Islanders, a people which speake the Germaine tongue, although in a dialect farre different in many things from that which now is commonly spoken in High-Germany, (which also is incident to the Danes, and inhabitants of <HI>Norwey</HI> and <HI>Swedland,</HI> with other countries nere neighbours and bordeing vpon the Dutch) do yet to this day call God, by the name of <HI>Druthin. Diogenes Laertius</HI> also seemeth to fauour this opinion, who, out of the authority of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> writeth that they were termed <HI>Semnothei,</HI> that is, religious and holy men, such as wholly gaue themselues to the worship and seruice of God. In that laborious and learned worke of my singular good friend <HI>M. William Camden,</HI> which he wrote of the antiquities of <HI>England,</HI> and intituled by the name of <HI>Britannia,</HI> I reade that one <HI>Albricus</HI> hath written that the Saxons did call a <HI>magus. <HI>Drij,</HI></HI> (by a word that signifieth in that language as much as a Diuine or Philosopher) and indeed <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth these Dru∣ides, <HI>Magi,</HI> that is, wise men, as the word is often vsed and expounded by the interpreters of the second chapter of S. Matthewes gospell. For that they were not so de∣nominated of the oke, he himselfe doth in a maner confesse; when he addeth in the same place, that they seeme to be deriued from a Greeke word signifying an oke or misselto. (Now there is no man that knoweth not, that to seeme to be so, and to be so indeed, are two diuers things.) Againe, how can they haue their denomination of the Greeke word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, when as <HI>Caesar,</HI> a very sufficient witnesse, testifieth plainly, that their arte and discipline was first inuented in <HI>England;</HI> where neuer any colony of the Greeks, for ought I know, was seated: for that voyage of <HI>Vlysses,</HI> (and so of his comming into this iland) is counted for a fable, and no true story, of all men of sound iudgement and discretion in this kinde of learning. Neither will I euer with <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> be made to beleeue the same, vntill some man or other shall shew me him that sewed together his bagge full of windes. And that the Germane tongue was spoken here, there is no man can deny, but he that thinketh that the authority of <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> is of no great validity. For <HI>Caesar</HI> hath flatly in the same place left recorded, that out of <HI>Belgium</HI> (The Low-countries, where he also affirmeth that the <HI>Germani Cisrhenani</HI> dwelt) certaine colonies passed ouer sea into this ile, and seated themselues here. He auoucheth that <HI>Caledonia</HI> (a great part of this ile) was inhabited of a people which came thither from <HI>Germany.</HI> And because there is nothing more sacred, in the iudgement of these Druidae, than the Oke and Misselto, as we haue shewed out of <HI>Pliny;</HI> and for that that <HI>Iupiter</HI> was here of them represented in the forme of a mighty high oke, as <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> teacheth vs; I do suppose that <HI>Diodorus</HI> called them by another name, or els of the same signification, although improperly, <HI>Saronides,</HI> (except euen in this place also we are to read <HI>Druidae:</HI> which we haue at large handled in the second edition of our <HI>Thesaurus</HI>) I know that <HI>Annius,</HI> out of his forged Berosus, doth write that these <HI>Druides</HI> were called by those diuers and sundry names, of <HI>Druius, Barrus, Sarron,</HI> certaine kings of the ancient Gauls. But as for these men, let them defend their credit themselues: I know it is shrewdly crackt. Some there are that do thinke that this by-word, <HI>Au Gui l' an neuf:</HI> With misselto commeth in the new yeere: which to this day euery yeere, vpon the last of December, is commonly vsed openly to be sung in <HI>France,</HI> came from them. peraduenture of this of <HI>Ouid, Ad viscum Druidae, Druidae can∣tare solebant.</HI> which are at large handled by <HI>Goropius</HI> in his <HI>Gallica, Vinetus</HI> vpon <HI>Asonius,</HI> and <HI>Vigenereus</HI> vpon <HI>Caesars</HI> Commentaries. <HI>Conradus Celtes, Irenicus, Althamer,</HI> and <HI>Auentine,</HI> do witnesse with me that these Druides, being driuen hence by <HI>Tiberius</HI> and <HI>Claudius</HI> Emperours of <HI>Rome,</HI> went beyond the Rhein, and seated themselues in <HI>High Germany;</HI> and here hence amongst them euen to this day remaineth that same kinde of night-bug, commonly called the Phi∣losophicall shoe, or as they terme it <HI>druttenfuss.</HI> And it is in forme (as the learned <HI>Ioachimus Camerarius</HI> the yonger hath signified vnto me by his letters) fiue cor∣nered, like vnto the emblem and hieroglyphicke of <HI>Hygeia,</HI> or, good health. This they engraue vpon their cradles, supposing that by that meanes the yoong infants are safely garded from the fairies, hobgoblins, and night-walking spirits. <HI>Conradus Celtes</HI> describeth certaine ancient stone images at the foot of the Pine-bearing moun∣taine (<HI>Vichtelberg</HI> they commonly call it, in the midst and center of all <HI>Germany</HI>) which as he sayth he saw in a certaine Abbey there. These he thinketh to resemble very liuelily the true counterfet of these Druides. They were in number six, sayth he, set in the wall at the church dore, seuen foot high a piece, barefooted, and bare∣headed, ech of them had on a Spanish cloake with a hood, and a scrip: a long beard downe as low as his girdle, and about his nostrils parted and shod this way and that way: ech of them in his hand had a booke and a walking staffe: they were of countenance sad and grim: their heads leaned somewhat toward one shoulder, hauing their eyes stedfastly fixed vpon the ground. That description of <HI>Iames Scepper,</HI> which he maketh of them, in his Corography of <HI>Germany,</HI> in my iudgement is fond and foolish: for he adorneth their necks, wrests, and fingers, with gold chaines, bracelets, and rings: moreouer to these he addceh a paire of buskins, such as the ancient Phi∣losophers were sayd to weare, with party-coloured garments. From whence he had this description I know not: for <HI>Pliny</HI> doth plainly affirme that they wore white garments; as we haue shewed before: and <HI>Strabo</HI> in his seuenth booke, (where he calleth them by the name of <HI>Va es,</HI> Prophets) describeth them in white vestures, with fine linnen frocks put ouer them, fastened together with a button, girt with a brasen girdle, and bare footed.</P>

Iohn Rhellicane <HI>saith that it conteined a part of</HI> Gallia Belgica, <HI>but which part it should be, he doth not name.</HI> H. Leodius <HI>would haue it to be that part which is about</HI> Henault, <HI>where the said <HI>Ba∣uays</HI> now standeth. But omitting these opinions, let vs heare what</HI> Caesar <HI>himselfe speaketh of this his</HI> Belgium. <HI>Hee in his 5. booke, where he speaketh of the distributing of the Legions in</HI> Belgia, <HI>hath these words:</HI> Of the which one he committed to <HI>Quintus Fabius</HI> the Legate, to be led against the <HI>Morini:</HI> another to <HI>Quintus Cicero,</HI> against the <HI>Neruij:</HI> the third to <HI>Titus Roscius,</HI> against the <HI>Essui:</HI> the fourth he commanded to winter, with <HI>Titus Labienus,</HI> in <HI>Rhemes,</HI> in the confines of <HI>Triers:</HI> three he placed in <HI>Belgium:</HI> ouer these he set as commanders <HI>Marcus Crassus</HI> the Treasurer, and <HI>Lucius Munatius Plancus,</HI> and <HI>Caius Trebonius</HI> the Legates: one legion, which he had taken vp hard beyond the <HI>Po,</HI> with fiue cohorts, he sent against the Eburones. <HI>And a little aboue in the same booke, where he speaketh of</HI> Britannia, <HI>you shall find these wordes:</HI> The sea coast (of <HI>Britaine</HI> he meaneth) is inhabited of those which by reason of pillage and warre, went from <HI>Belgium</HI> thi∣ther: all which for the most part are called by the names of those cities where they were bred and borne. <HI>Heere first it appeareth very plainly that</HI> Caesar <HI>vnder the name of</HI> Belgium <HI>comprehendeth not only one city, but many: then, that he vnderstandeth not by it all</HI> Gallia Belgica: <HI>seeing that he nameth the</HI> Morini, Neruij, Essui, Rheni, <HI>and</HI> Eburones, <HI>all which nations, he himselfe and other good writers, do ascribe to</HI> Gallia Belgicae. <HI>Therefore it is more cleare than the noone day that</HI> Belgium <HI>is a part of</HI> Belgica: <HI>but what part it should be that is not so cleare. That it is not about</HI> Bauacum <HI>(Bauais) <HI>in</HI></HI> Henault, <HI>as</HI> Leodius <HI>would haue it, it is manifest in that, that this is situate amongst the</HI> Neruij, <HI>which</HI> Caesar <HI>himselfe doth exclude out of</HI> Belgium. <HI>Neither can I be perswaded that it was neere the</HI> Bellouaci, <HI>but rather that it was that part of</HI> Belgica, <HI>which is more neere the sea, and lieth vp higher toward the North: namely, where about the three great riuers the</HI> Rhein; Maese <HI>and</HI> Scheldt <HI>do meet and fall into the maine ocean: these do affoord an easie passage and fall into the sea and from thence a short cut into</HI> Britaine. <HI>Moreouer it is more likely that they should passe the sea, which were acquainted and vsed to it, and were seated vpon this shore and bankes of these riuers, then those which dwelt vp higher into the country, to whom the sea was more fearefull and terrible. They therefore that went from</HI> Belgium, <HI>into</HI> Brittaine, <HI>did only change coast for coast.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of the originall and reason of the word</HI> Belgium <HI>and</HI> Belgica, <HI>the opinions of sundrie writers are diuers. Some there are which deriue it of <HI>Belgen</HI> or <HI>Welgen,</HI> a word of our owne, which signifieth a</HI> stranger. <HI>Another man of great learning and iudgement fetcheth it from <HI>Belgen</HI> or <HI>Balgen,</HI> signifying</HI> to be angrie, to fight. <HI>Our Chronicles do thinke it so named of</HI> Belgis, <HI>the chiefe city of this prouince. Neither do they agree in the placing and seating of it: for one of them placeth it at</HI> Bauais, <HI>a towne in</HI> Henault: <HI>the other at <HI>Veltsick</HI> a village about</HI> Oudenard. <HI>They which thinke it so named of the city</HI> Bel∣gis <HI>(which notwithstanding is no where else read of in any good authour, either Geographer or Historian) they haue</HI> Isidore, <HI>in the 4. chapter of the 13. booke of his</HI> Origines, <HI>for their patrone, where he thus speaketh:</HI> Belgis is a city of Gallia, whereof Gallica the prouince tooke the name. <HI>The same hath</HI> Hesy∣chius, <HI>the Grecian before him, in his Lexicon:</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>that is,</HI> Belgy was so named of the city Belges: <HI>as also</HI> Honorius <HI>in his counterfeit of the world.</HI> Iustine <HI>in his 24. booke citeth out of</HI> Trogus Pompeius <HI>one</HI> Belgius (Pausanias <HI>nameth him</HI> Bolgius) <HI>a captaine of the Gauls, from whom it is like they tooke their name, if you will beleeue</HI> Berosus <HI>that chaungling.

Well, let vs leaue these to the censure of the learned, and so proceed to certaine testimonies of ancient writers, which we thinke wilbe both plea∣sant and profitable to the student of Chorography.</HI></P>
<P>Caesar, <HI>in his 1. booke of the warres of</HI> France, <HI>thus speaketh:</HI> All <HI>GALLIA</HI> is diuided into <HI>3.</HI> parts: of the which the <HI>Belgae</HI> do inhabite one: the <HI>Aquita∣ni</HI> another: the third, those which in their language are called <HI>Celtae,</HI> but in the Latine <HI>Galli: Againe, within a few lines after:</HI> Of all these the <HI>Belgae</HI> are most stout and hardy: because that being further off from the quaint behauiour and maners of the prouince: and for that they haue no trafficke with merchants, or such as do bring in those things which effeminate mens mindes: againe because they are next neighbours to the Germanes, which dwell beyond the <HI>Rhein:</HI> with whom they make warre continually. <HI>Item, in the same page he thus describeth the situation of their country:</HI> The <HI>Belgae</HI> do dwell in the skirts of <HI>Gallia:</HI> they do belong to that part which is within the riuer <HI>Rhein:</HI> they are vpon the North and East sides of it. <HI>The same authour in his 2. booke hath these words:</HI> Caesar found that many of the <HI>Belgae</HI> came from the Germanes, which long since passed ouer the <HI>Rhein</HI> and seated themselues there by reason of the great fertility of the place: and that they had driuen out the Gauls, which formerly had dwelled there: and that these were the onely men, which in the daies of our fathers, all <HI>Gallia</HI> being sore troubled, kept the Teutones and Cimbres from entering within the lists of their territories: whereupon it came to passe, that the memoriall and record of these their famous acts haue made them to take much vpon them, and to be highly conceited of their great stomacks and skill in martiall affaires. <HI>Suet. in Tib. 9.</HI> In the German war he sent ouer <HI>40000.</HI> voluntaries into <HI>Gallia. Again in the 8. booke of Caes. Com.</HI> The <HI>Belgae,</HI> whose valour was great. <HI>Strabo in the 4. booke of his Geography saith:</HI> The <HI>Belgae</HI> weare cassockes or cloakes, their haire long, and side breeches about their loines. In steed of coates or ierkins they vse a kind of sleeued garmert slit, hanging down to their twist, or as low as their buttockes. Their wooll is very course and rough, yet is it cut off close to the skinne: of that they weaue their course thick cassocks, which they call <HI>laenas,</HI> rugges or mantles. Their weapons accordingly, are long swords hanging down along by their right side, a long target, lances answerable, and a iauelin (<HI>meris</HI> or <HI>materis,</HI> as some read) a kind of short pike with a barbed head: some vse bowes and slinges: others haue a staffe like a dart, which they do not cast with a loop or thong, (as our Irish do) but with the hand only; yea and that further than one can well shoot an arrow: this they especially vse in hunting and fowling. They do all for the most part, euen to this day, vse to lie vpon the ground; they dine and suppe sitting in their beds. Their meat generally is made of milke and all kind of flesh, especially porke, both fresh and powdered. Their hogs do lie abroad in the fields night and day: these for bignesse, strength and swiftnesse of foot do surpasse those of other countries; and if a man be not vsed to them they are as dangerous to meet withall as with a rauening woolfe. They build their houses with boords, planks and hardles, couered ouer with a very great roofe. They haue so many and great herds of cattle and hogs, that they do not only serue <HI>Rome</HI> with those fornamed cassocks or rugs, powdered beefe and bacon, but also many other places of <HI>Italy.</HI> The most of their cities and commonwealths are gouerned by the Nobility and gentry: informer times the common people vsed yearely to choose one Prince, and one Generall captaine for the wars. They are for the most part subiect to the behests of the Romans. They haue a kind of custome in their councels proper and peculiar to themselues: for if any man do interrupt or trouble another by loud speaking, or by making any tumult, the sergeant commeth to him with a naked knife in his hand and threatneth him if he hold not his peace: this he doth the second and third time: if then he will not be quiet, he cutteth off so much of his cassocke, that the rest may be good for nothing. This is a common thing to them with many other barbarous nations, that the seruices or of∣fices of men and women are ordered clean contrary to the customes &amp; maners which heere we vse. <HI>Item, in another place.</HI> The Gauls the neerer they are to the North and to the Sea. so much the more hardy and valiant they are. They do especially commend the <HI>Belgae,</HI> who are diuided into <HI>15.</HI> nations (in <HI>Caesar!</HI> find <HI>31.</HI> mentioned) so that the <HI>Belgae</HI> alone susteined the assault of the Germans, Cimbers and Teutones. What an infinite number of men they were able to make, may h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere hence be ga∣thered, that long since there were mustered of the <HI>Belgae,</HI> only of able men fit for the war, <HI>300000.</HI> (this number <HI>Caesar</HI> in the beginning of the <HI>2.</HI> booke of the wars of <HI>France,</HI> encreaseth by <HI>27000.</HI> more) <HI>Item,</HI> some there are which diuide the Gauls into <HI>3</HI> nations: namely, the <HI>Aquitani, Belgae</HI> and <HI>Celtae. Item,</HI> The <HI>Belgae</HI> do pos∣sesse the places neere the Sea, euen as low as the mouth of the <HI>Rhein: Dio. Sic. in his 6. booke.</HI> A nation for the most part situat in those places toward the North: it is a cold country, so that in winter time in steed of water, it is all couered ouer with deep snow. The ice also in this country, is so great and thicke, that their riuers are frozen so hard that they may go ouer them; and that not only some few in a company together, but euen whole armies with horses, carts and cariage. <HI>Plutarch in the life of Caesar.</HI> But after that news came that the <HI>Belgae,</HI> the most mighty and warlike nation of the Gauls, which possessed the third part of all <HI>Gallia,</HI> had gathered together many thousands of armed men, purposing to make head, he goeth against them with all possible speed, <HI>&amp;c. Appianus in his history of France. Caesar</HI> spee∣ding himselfe against the <HI>Belgae,</HI> at the foord and passage ouer a certain riuer, slew so many of them, that the heaps of dead bodies serued for a bridge. <HI>Ammian. in the 15 booke of his history.</HI> Of all the Gauls the ancients did account the <HI>Belgae</HI> to be most valiant &amp; stout, for that they were remote from those that liued more court∣like and tenderly, neither were they corrupted and made effeminate with forren delicates and foolish toies, but had long been exercised in wars &amp; quarels against those Germans which dwelt beyond the <HI>Rhein: Dion in his 55 booke.</HI> The <HI>Bataui</HI> are excellent horsemen. <HI>Again in his 39 booke.</HI> The <HI>Morini</HI> and <HI>Menapij</HI> dwell not in towns and cities, but in cottages and mountaines enclosed about with very thicke woods. <HI>He meaneth Arduenna (Arden) that huge forest which then was more vast than now it is) Florus in his 3. booke.</HI> The next was a far more cruell battell, for then they fought for their libertie. <HI>Pliny in the 22. c. of his 26. booke.</HI> In the prouince of <HI>Belgica</HI> they cut a kind of white stone with a saw (as they do wood yea and more easily) to make slaits and tiles for couerings for their houses, not only flat and plain, but also hollow and crooked to serue both for roofe-tiles, &amp; gutter-tiles: yea and when they list, for those kind of couerings which they call <HI>pauonacea,</HI> like the peacocks taile: these also are such as may be cut or sawed. <HI>Again in the 36. c. of his 16 book.</HI> The <HI>Belgae</HI> do stamp the tuft or beard of this kind of reed, and lay∣ing it between the meeting of the ioints and plankes of their ships do calke them as sure as with pitch and rozen. <HI>Item in the 22 c. of his 10. booke,</HI> he writeth that from the country of the <HI>Morini</HI> geese did come on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> feet as far as <HI>Rome. In 1. c. of his 12. booke he saith that</HI> The plane tree was come now as far as the <HI>Morini,</HI> into a tributary soile: that these nations might pay custome euen for the shade. <HI>In the 25 c. of the 15. book.</HI> In <HI>Belgia</HI> and vpon the banks of the <HI>Rhein,</HI> the Por∣tugal cherries are most esteemed <HI>In the 14. c. of the same booke, where he speaketh of diuers kind of apples:</HI> which for that they haue no kernels, are called of the <HI>Belgae, spadonia poma,</HI> spayd apples. <HI>In the 5 c. of his 19 booke:</HI> Gelduba is the castle called that is built vpon the <HI>Rhein,</HI> where grow the best skirwyrts or white parsneps. <HI>In the 8 c. of his 17 booke.</HI> Of all forren nations that I know the <HI>Vbij,</HI> whose soile is very fertile, when they plow their ground, do dig vp any sort of earth so that it be at least <HI>3</HI> foot deep: and spreading ouer it a sandy kind of earth a foot thick, do battle and harten their lands as others do with dongue or marle. <HI>Mar∣cus Varro in the 9 c. of his 1. book of Husbandrie.</HI> In <HI>Gallia</HI> beyond the Alpes, vp higher into the country about the <HI>Rhein,</HI> I came to certain countries, where neither vines, nor oliues nor apples did grow, where they compassed their grounds with a kind of white chalke digged out of the earth. <HI>Virgil in the 1. booke of his Georgickes.</HI> Belgica vel molli meliùs feret esse da collo. <HI>Lucan in his 1. booke.</HI> Et docilis rector rostrati Belga couini. <HI>Martial. in his Xenia.</HI> Cantarena mihi si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, vel massa licebit, De Menapis lauti de petasone vorent.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Thinke there is no man, studious of ancient historie, that is ignorant, that this countrey was called of the most ancient writers, especi∣ally the Graecians, <HI>CELTICA,</HI> and the people therof <HI>CELTI</HI> or <HI>CELTICA.</HI> From whence the word <HI>Kelt</HI> doth remaine amongst them; whereby they yet do vsually call one another in their familiar speech and communication. Some there are which thinke them to be called by <HI>Iosephus ASCHANARI,</HI> whenas notwithstanding he sayth that these are interpreted of the Graecians to be the <HI>Rhegini:</HI> better perhaps and more truly, <HI>Rheini,</HI> as it were the borderers vpon the <HI>Rhene,</HI> who also of Stephanus are called <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Tacitus reporteth that the word <HI>GERMANIA</HI> had not beene long vsed, and to be but lately heard of. The same authour ad∣deth, that this name was inuented by themselues. Wherefore I do more easily assent to them, which deriue the originall of this word from the etymon of the countrey it selfe, than from the Latines. For it is much more likely that a nation should impose a name vpon it selfe deriued from that language which it vnderstood, than from a forren and strange tongue whereof it was altogether ignorant. I thinke therefore they erre which thinke this name to be made <HI>à germine,</HI> that is, of buds or yong sprouts; by reason of the great fer∣tilitie and plenty of all things here growing. Of this opinion are Festus and Isidorus. Those also which deriue the name from the Latine word <HI>germanus</HI> signifying a <HI>brother,</HI> as Strabo doth, as who would say, brethren to the Gauls or French men, from whom, as he sayth, they little differ, in my conceit are as farre wide from the trueth. Our countrey man, as Rhenanus and others doe thinke it to be compounded of <HI>gar</HI> and <HI>man,</HI> to wit, <HI>garman,</HI> that is, <HI>all man</HI> or <HI>manlike.</HI> Our Goropius of <HI>ger</HI> and <HI>man</HI> (comming neerer to the writing or letter) of <HI>ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en,</HI> which signifieth <HI>to gather,</HI> as scraping together a booty or pray. And the same man in another place deriueth it of <HI>ger,</HI> which, saith he, amongst our ancesters signifieth <HI>warre:</HI> which I see also pleaseth Iustus Lipsius best. I know that <HI>gerre</HI> (or rather <HI>guerre</HI>) in the latter French tongue signifieth <HI>warre;</HI> but whether it signifieth so in our ancient Germane tongue, I know not. I doe easily be∣leeue that this nation first wrote and named it selfe <HI>werman,</HI> of <HI>wer,</HI> with <HI>e</HI> long, a mere Germane word, which signifieth any weapon whereby we smite or offend our enemie. From hence <HI>weren</HI> signifieth to defend himselfe against the enemie: and we call euery man fit to beare armes, <HI>weerman</HI> or <HI>weerbaerman,</HI> (that is, a war∣likeman.) Insomuch that they all called themselues <HI>wermanos,</HI> or, <HI>wermannos,</HI> that is, warlike men. And Cesar and Tacitus, besides others, are most sufficient witnesses, that this name doth altogether agree with the nature and disposition of this nation. As also Dionysius Afer, who surnameth these Martialists or warlike men <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But the cause is plaine why these do call and write themselues <HI>Germanes;</HI> because they, wanting the digamma or <HI>W,</HI> in stead of it haue substituted the <HI>G.</HI> which also we see elswhere done of them in the like case: as, for Wilhelmus, they write Gulielmus; for Waltherus, Galtherus; for Walfridus, Galfridus, &amp;c. So also it is likely that for <HI>Walli,</HI> they wrote and pronounced <HI>Galli.</HI> For euen we Germanes, on this side Rhene, retaining the ancient language, doe yet name these <HI>Galli</HI> by no other name than <HI>Walen.</HI> The <HI>Galli</HI> also themselues romanizing (the libertie and ancient tongue being lost) doe vnto this very day imitate this change of letters. These few words out of many are for an example: for they vsually both write and pronounce, <HI>vin</HI> for <HI>wijn, <HI>Guesp</HI></HI> for <HI>Wesp, <HI>Gand</HI></HI> for <HI>Wandt, <HI>Guedde</HI></HI> for <HI>Weedt,</HI> by which they meane Wine, a Wasp, a Gloue, and Woad. So also I finde in a manuscript <HI>Guandali</HI> for <HI>Wandali.</HI> If any man shall obiect that Strabo, Di∣onysius Afer, Ptolemaeus, and some other Graecians, who knew the digamma Aeolicum, that is, the <HI>W,</HI> haue notwithstanding written it with a single <HI>V,</HI> I answer, that this nation was knowen to these men in times past only vnder the name of Celtae, and that this word <HI>Germane</HI> was first vsed of Cesar or the other Latines in their writings: from whom the Grecians, imitating this writing, haue translated this word into their language. But if any man desireth to reade more of the etymology and reason of the word <HI>Germanie,</HI> let him peruse H. Iunius his Batauia in the one and twentieth chapter. There are some historians that doe verily beleeue that all the <HI>Germanes</HI> were in latter times called <HI>Alemanes,</HI> Vopiscus so persuading them in the life of Proculus. Yet it is manifest out of Aelius Spartianus (who repor∣teth that Antoninus Caracalla the Romane Emperour, both nations by him being subdued, tooke him the surname of them both, and was intituled both by the name of <HI>GERMANICVS</HI> and <HI>ALEMANNICVS</HI>) that these were two diuers nations. Moreouer, this same thing is to be seene in the marble inscriptions of the Empe∣rours, Valens, Valentinian, and Gratian: as also in the titles of Iustinian the Emperour. Againe, Ammianus in his <HI>26</HI> booke writeth, that the Almanes brake thorow the borders of Germanie, whereby it is as clere as the noone day that they were diuers. But that was the name of one family or people, this of the whole stocke or nation. Notwithstanding, although this Alemannie of Stephanus, Ammianus, and other writers of that age was accounted only a part of Germanie, namely of that which lieth about the riuer Aleman (commonly called <HI>Altmul</HI>) yet all men of other countries, ignorant of the Germane tongue, do vse the word Alemanie for all Germanie, and by Alemanes, do meane all the Germanes. But the inhabitants at this day name themselues <HI>Teutschen, <HI>Tuisiones:</HI></HI> whether of god <HI>Tuisius,</HI> sonne of the earth, of whom Tacitus maketh mention, or of <HI>Tuisco,</HI> Noë his sonne, of whom Pseudoberosus speaketh; I leaue to the iudgement of the learned reader, for to me it is vncer∣taine. And thus much of the name. Ouid writing to Liuia, doth grace it with a very heroicall surname and honourable titles, when he calleth it <HI>ORBEM GER∣MANVM, ORBEM NOVVM, &amp; ORBEM IGNOTVM: The Germane world, The new world,</HI> and <HI>The vnknowen world.</HI> Ptolemey surnameth it <HI>THE GREAT.</HI> Pliny in the third booke of his Epistles vnto his friend Macer, calleth it <HI>LATISSIMAM, A most wide and spacious countrey.</HI> Learne the forme of it out of Dionysius and Priscian his interpreter, or as some call him, Rhemnius, in his periegesis in this verse: <HI>Haec tergo similis taurino dicirur esse:</HI> In forme, they say, it's somewhat like vnto a large buffe hide. (but falsly: for this is truly spoken of Spaine, as Arid. Papius, before me, hath well obserued.) The si∣tuation and limits of this countrey are diuers and sundry wayes described, according to the diuersitie and alteration of times. Plutarch in Marius, doth extend it from the Exterior or Outmost sea, and the Northern parts, to the rising of the Sunne neere the fenne Moeotis <HI>[Mar delle Zabbache]</HI> where it toucheth the Ponticke Scy∣thia. Pomponius Mela also, and Pseudoberosus, do confine it with Sarmatia Europoea. And Martian stretcheth it fron Hister <HI>[Donawe]</HI> to the Ocean, euen vp as high as the deserts of Sarmatia: (But the word <HI>Armeniae</HI> is falsly read for <HI>Sarmatiae,</HI> that I may with Pintian, by the way correct this fault in this authour.) Dio∣nysius Apher also placeth the Germanes at the fenne Moeotis. Yea and P. Diacono in his first chapter, vnder the name of Germanie, comprehendeth also all Scandie or Scone in Denmarke, where he describeth that denne or caue neere the Scricsinners, in which seuen men slept. And this I thinke to be that Exteriour Germanie which Eusebius in his sixt booke <HI>De Praepar. Euang.</HI> describeth toward the North. Isidore therefore rightly placeth the Riphaean mountaines at the head of Germa∣nie. Others haue made the sea, the Alpes, Vistula (the riuer <HI>Wixell</HI>) and the Rheine, to be the limits of the same. But Tacitus taketh from it whatsoeuer is be∣tweene Donawe and the Alpes. For he confineth it within these limits: namely, the Rhene, Donawe, the Dacia's (<HI>Transsyluania</HI> and <HI>Walachia</HI>) and the Sarma∣tia's, <HI>(Russia)</HI> with whom also Ptolemey the prince of Geographers consenteth. But Strabo and Pomponius do notwithstanding extend it euen to the very Alpes, and so by these mountaines do diuide it from Italy, as it were by a certeine naturall rampart or bulwarke. And this is yet at this day the true and naturall Germanie: which on the North side is circumscribed with the sea, on the South with the Alpes, on the West with the Rhene, and on the East with Vistula <HI>(Wixell)</HI> or Odera. Moreouer, Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dion do diuide this true Germanie into the <HI>VPPER</HI> and <HI>LOWER:</HI> they call that the <HI>VPPER GERMANIE</HI> which is neerer the fountaines or head of the Rhene; that the <HI>LOWER</HI> which reacheth from thence to the Ocean. But beyond the Rhene also, namely in <HI>Belgia,</HI> Ptolemey hath other two Germanies, to wit, a <HI>SVPERIOR</HI> and <HI>INFERIOR.</HI> To whom agreeth Marcellinus, who nameth this the <HI>SECOND,</HI> that the <HI>FIRST.</HI> But I do not iudge these to pertaine to the true Germanie: but that it was so improperly called of the Germanes, who, as Dion witnesseth, afterward possessed it, and fixed their seats there. And first of the <HI>Tungri,</HI> who as Tacitus writeth, first of all other passed ouer the Rhene. Item we read in Cesar of certaine <HI>Belgae,</HI> sprung from the Germanes. Hence it is that he witnesseth that the <HI>Neruij, Aduatici, Atrebates, Ambiani, Morini, Menapij, Caletes, Verocasses, Veromandui, Catuaci, Condrusi, Eburones, Caeresi, Paemani, Segni,</HI> were generally <HI>GERMANI TRANSRHENANI, the Germans beyond Rhene.</HI> Tacitus saith that the <HI>Van∣giones, Triboci,</HI> and <HI>Nemetes</HI> were called Germanes. Suetonius recordeth that <HI>Tiberius</HI> the Emperour placed fortie thousand Germanes in France neere the banke of the Rhene. Eutropius writeth that there were of them foure hundred thousand. Item by the testimony of Pliny we are made to beleeue that the Germane na∣tion did dwell euen as high as the riuer Scaldis <HI>(the Sceldt.)</HI> And that at this day the Germans are seated beyond Scaldis, vp as high as the straits of the Ocean, the language which they vse, doth manifestly proue. So that Dion in his <HI>53</HI> booke hath truely related, that they haue spread themselues as farre as the British ocean, vp to the citie Bononia or <HI>Boloigne:</HI> which Zosimus calleth a citie of Lower Germanie.</P>
<P>But let vs omit these things, and returne to the description of the true and ancient Germanie, which we haue set forth in this table. Seneca reporteth, that there is a continuall Winter, vnpleasant aire, and barren soile. Pomponius writeth that it is troubled with many riuers, rough and vneuen by reason of many mountaines, and for the most part not to be trauelled or passed thorow, by reason of the great woods and fennes. Frontinus affirmeth the same, where he writeth, that the Germans were woont to assault the Romans out of these places, as out of obscure couerts, and thither safely to retire themselues againe. Tacitus sayth that it is euery where be spread and couered with hideous woods, and loathsome and stincking fennes, the land or countrey is vnpleasant, the aire is sharpe, it is hard to be plowed, and ill fauoured to behold. It is moister towards the Galliae <HI>(France;)</HI> windier towards Noricum <HI>(Bayern)</HI> and the Pannoniae. <HI>(Austria and Hungary.)</HI> The cause I adde, because here the Alpes are opposite, which entertaining the boisterous Northern winde, do by their extraordinary height beat it backe againe, and so redoubleth the violence of the blast. (The copy here is sound &amp; good, although a great scholar doth thinke it faulty.) There, because the ocean is neerer, Ouid and Horatius call it hideous cruell and sauage. Manilius sayth, that it is sit only for wilde beasts: which indeed is wholly occupied by the Hercynian forrest, being not inferior to any for greatnesse and fame (as Pliny reporteth.) For this Hercynianwood, (which Eratosthenes, Apollonius and Ptolemaeus, being Grecians, name <HI>orcynium</HI>) of all others by farre the greatest, is threescore dayes iourney in length, as Mela sayth. Which, seeing that no man hath more diligently described this wood than Cesar, we will here set downe his words, which are these: The bredth of this Hercynian wood is nine long dayes iourney ouer. It beginneth from the borders of the Heluetians and Nemeti, and Rauraci, and so running along directly by the riuer Donawe, it commeth vp close by the confines of the Dacia's. From hence it windeth Northward, or toward the left hand, leauing the course of the riuer, and by reason of the huge greatnesse of the same, toucheth the bounds of many nations. Neither is there any man of all this Ger∣manie, which can say that he hath either heard of, or gone to the end of that wood, when he had beene in it threescore dayes together: there is not any man that euer

<PB REF="278"/> hath heard in what place it beginneth, &amp;c. Plinie hath these words of the same wood: The hugenesse of the okes of the Hercynian wood, neuer lopt or cut since the world was made, doth almost for their immortality exceed all other miracles. That I may omit other things which would not be beleeued; it is ma∣nifest, that the little hilles are eleuated by the mutuallil encounter or crossing of the roots one within another: but where the earth is hollow and not fast, there they rise with arches euen vp to the boughs, and striuing as it were among themselues, are crooked like broad gates, that whole troups of horsemen may go vn∣derneath them. Suidas out of Iulian describeth the roughnesse hereof: If any man, sayth he, shall consider the vnpassable Tempe of Thessalie, or the narrow straights of Thermopylae, or the great and steepe hie mountaine Taurus, it is nothing to this; they are not so difficult and hard to doe, as to passe thorow this Hercynian wood. And thus much of this groue or forest, inaccessible, as Florus writeth of it. Nay, but Plinie addeth that the other part of Germanie is al∣so full of woods. Item Tacitus in the fourth of his Annals, sayth that abroad they haue forests of huge beasts, &amp; at home herds or droues of smaller cattell. We reade in the same authour, that the ground of Germanie is sandie couered ouer with a very thin laine of turfes, yet their pastures are very commendable. Tacitus maketh it to be reasonably well stored with cattell, but impatient of fruitfull trees. Herodian reporteth, that the Germans haue few buildings of stone or bricke; and that they rather delight to abide in arbours and bowers made in thicke woods, by coupling and fastening the boughs together. They haue no habitations or houses but such as wearinesse maketh for a day. Seneca in the booke of Gods prouidence reporteth that they defend themselues from storme and tempest by the couerture of reeds or leaues. Tacitus sayth that they make caues vnder the earth, and couer them ouer with dung, and vse them for pla∣ces of refuge, to which they may in danger retire themselues. From whose opinion a place in <HI>Strabo</HI> doth not farre seeme to differ: where he sayth they dwell in cottages made for one day, that so they may with more ease change their soile, and putting their household-stuffe into carts, may depart whither they best like. For Eusebius m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keth them ignorant both of Geometrie and of Architectrie. So that the same Tacitus doth most truly deny that the Germanes do vsually inhabit or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell in cities; or can abide by any meanes to ioyne house to house close together, but to haue them disioyned or seuered, as shall fall out by reason of some brooke, field, or wood. I also will adde this, that they haue anciently had few cities: for in all ancient histories of ech tongue, I see scarse one or two na∣med before Ptolemies time. Neither since him is there any mention of them in any other writer. Capitolinus writeth of Maximinus the Emperour, that he burned three or foure hundred villages: but there is no mention of cities. Strabo (as diligent a writer as any in that kinde) remembreth only <HI>Bouiasmus,</HI> the palace or court of Maroboduus. Tacitus, to whom Germanie was best knowen, maketh mention of <HI>Matium, Arenacum, Batauodurum,</HI> and one or two castles neere the mouth of the Rheine, which any man would sooner iudge to be ascribed to France than to Germanie. In other writers, there is not one word of any cities. And thus much in generall of the situation of the soile, the forme and nature of this countrey. Now some things peculiar to it, are to be conside∣red: and first I will speake of the riuer Rheine, that which I haue read in a certaine epistle of Iulian the Emperour to Maximus the Philosopher; his words are these: Rheine doth violently carry away bastard-infants as a reuenger of the vnchaste bed: but those that are borne in wedlocke of chaste parents, it bea∣reth aloft vpon the top of the water, and restoreth them againe to the trembling hands of the mother: and by the preseruation of the infant doth pay as it were the true and incorrupted testimony of chaste and laudable wedlocke. Nazianzene, Nonnus in his Dionysiacks, and an ancient Greeke Epigram doe also auer this to be true. There are other also which do giue another, and in mine opinon, a truer cause of this dipping of children in the Rheine, which we will by and by relate. There is a fountaine among the Mattiaci, which, being drawen, doth boile three dayes together: and about the brinke the waters make pumeise stones, as Pliny witnesseth. The same authour describeth in Frisland, a fountaine of sweet water, whereof if one shall drinke, within two yeeres after his teeth will all fall out of his head: and that the herbe called Britannica, there found, is a present remedie against that danger. As in Nilus so in Donawe or Ister (as Suidas reporteth) there are great falles of water, like a mountaine, growing vnder the water, according to the whole breadth of the riuer, against which the streame falling doth with great &amp; terrible noise swell backe againe; and first making a rumbling amongst the rocks, at length mounting ouer them causeth, the stearme by the violent fall being forced to turne round, whirlpooles, troublous motions, and dangerous gulfs. Strabo also maketh mention of the same. Germanie hath the best <HI>Amber</HI> (which as Tacitus writeth, they call <HI>Glosse</HI>) which they gather betweene the shallow foords and the sea shores); Brasse ore, or the brassie stone, which they call <HI>Cadmia,</HI> crystall, the callais, a precious stone, which they prefer before that of Arabia, the onyx, and a white kinde of those stones com∣monly called <HI>Ceraunia,</HI> which if you holde in the open aire doth diminish the glittering of the starres; witnesse Plinie and Soline. Here also is found the A∣damant, if Scepsius, in this same authour, doth speake the trueth; and the Topaze (except there be some fault in the copy, in the fourth and eight chapters of the seuen and thirtieth booke: for some books read in this place, Carmania for Germania.) Tacitus dares not denie but that Germanie hath veines both of siluer and golde: and he reporteth that Curtius Rufus dambd vp a caue in the field of Matium, to search for veines of siluer. Plinie reporteth that mines of brasse were found but the other day in Germanie. I finde in the same Tacitus that the Gothini did dayly worke in yron mines. Lycophron describeth the hog fish with foure feet in Donawe. And about the head or fountaines hereof Pliny speaketh of a kinde of blacke fishes, which being eaten are present death. The same authour mentioneth the <HI>Esox,</HI> a fish proper to the riuer Rheine: (some read <HI>Exossem;</HI> againe, for Rheine they reade Donawe: for I know the fish <HI>Exossis,</HI> that is, a fish that hath no maner of bones, no not the backe bone, which liueth in Donawe, as Iornandes testifieth with me, not in the Rheine: of whose clammy flesh, not vnlike to the sauour of yoong porke, we sometimes tasted at Vienna in Austria, but much against our stomacke. They call it <HI>Hausen,</HI> namely of the greatnesse, shewing it selfe in the water like little houses. Cassiodor in his twelfth booke attributeth the Carpe to Donawe. The riuer Maemus (Aelianus calleth it Danubius) affoordeth the fish called Silurus: the best goose feathers, especially those next the body: the radish roots, as great as little children: the herbe <HI>Corruda</HI> a kinde of sperage, as Pliny testifieth; who confesseth also that he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here an hony combe eight foot long. The same authour with Solinus and Cesar doth ascribe these beasts as proper to this place, the alcen, the buffe, the vrus, and the machlis. Cassiodor in the third booke of his <HI>Variar.</HI> chap. <HI>50,</HI> sayth that the Alemanes oxen are more precious than those of other places, by reason of their great bodies. Cesar also in the sixt booke of the French warres mentioneth a kinde of oxe, of which he thus sayth: There is an oxe in shape and proportion like to an hart; from the midst of whose fore∣head there groweth betweene the eares, one horne higher than the rest, and straiter than any of those hornes which we know: from the top thereof they spread abroad like the boughs of the palme-tree. There are birds in Hercynia whose feathers doe shine in the night like fire, as Pliny reporteth, or whose quilles, as Solinus sayth, doe glister and shine in the darke, yea although the night be neuer so darke and ouercast: insomuch that the men of that place do often times so appoint their nightly out goings, that they may vse them as lights for the directing and finding of their way: and hauing cast them before in the darke wayes, do see which way to go, by the marke of the glittering feathers. Of these very same speaketh Priscian, or whosoeuer els was the interpreter of Dionysius his Pe∣riegesis, <HI>Et pascit volucres mirum fulgentibus alis, Quies ducibus noctu cernuntur flexa viarum.</HI> Here liueth the golden feathered fowle, A woonder tis to tell, Whose quilles being strew'd in darkest wayes, Do guide men passing well. Pliny hath left written, that there is seene in Germany, especially in Win∣ter the <HI>turdus</HI> or felfare. Plutarch in his lesser parallels writeth that there are two altars in Germanie, which yerely vpon a certaine day do sound like trumpets in memorie of the daughter of C. Marius sacrificed long since in that place. Now let vs speake something of the Nation. Columella sayth it is a land of most tall men: Pliny and Solinus who imitated or followed him, say that it is a rich countrey for men, full of very many big and boisterous people. Sidonius calleth the Alemans cruell and fierce: Cassiodor, a proud and innumerable nation. Pausanias in his Arcadia reporteth the same. Cesar, Arrianus, Appianus, He∣rodotus, Polyaenus, Vegetius, and Columella do all ioyntly affirme, that they are all tall of stature and very big limm'd men. Dionysius calleth them, White Germanes: Calpurnius Flaccus, Ruddy: Tacitus, Blew eyed: Iuuenal, Yellow hair'd: others, Red hair'd. Martiall and Seneca describe them with their haire wreathed and bound vp in a knot. Tertullian in his booke <HI>De Virginibus velandis,</HI> doth highly commend their goodly locks. Appian sayth that they are very crabbed in maners, and cruelly minded. Cesar calleth them barbarous and cruell: Iosephus in the second booke of the Iewish warre, chap. <HI>16,</HI> stout and hardy: Dionysius Afer, very warlike and martiall: Hegesippus, boisterous and inuincible: Arrian and Dionysius, souldierlike: his olde interpreter, sterne and surly: Arrianus, proud and arrogant. There is no man more couragious than a Germane, none more eager or hot to giue an onset or assault, none more desirous of warres; as Seneca, in his booke of Anger, writeth. Herodian calleth it a nation very couetous of money: Ouid, faithlesse and trecherous: Cesar, false traitours and deepe dissemblers: Paterculus, most crafty in their greatest cruelty and borne to lie. (But who can expect better commendations and report of an enemie prouoked to the full, beat backe and forced to flie with great losse and slaughter more than once or twice?) Tacitus, who liued among them, in the third booke of his histories, speaketh more vprightly, when he sayth, That the souldiers are most fierce and desperate: and that the nation deligh∣teth much in warre, is nothing wily or crafty, but such as easily layeth open the secrets of their hearts, disclosing their mindes one to another, and such as no man may better trust vpon their credit. The same authour sayth, that Iulian the Emperour in his Misopogonos, who writeth that he hath learned by expe∣rience, that it is a nation which can not flatter, but such as loueth to liue freely and plainly with all men. Ptolemaeus in the second booke of his Quadripartite teacheth that they are by nature and constitution of body temperate, and milde in condition, by reason of the qualitie of the region wherein they dwell. Thus much of their nature and qualities: now a word or two of their rites and maners. Assoone as their children are borne, they cary them to the riuer, (layed vp∣on a shield, sayth the Greeke epigram) as they come warme from their mothers wombe, as Galen and Aristotle in the eight booke of his Politicks, doe t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e: and there dipping them as the Smith doth his hot yrons into the colde water, do make triall both of the hardnesse of their nature, and by this meanes withall they do much strengthen the body. This is that which Claudian sayth, <HI>Nascentes explorat gurgite Rhenus.</HI> The riuer Rhene trieth those that are new borne. And this I thinke to be the more likely cause: forasmuch as the Poet attributeth the same to his Italians: for he sayth, <HI>Natos ad flumina primùm Deferimus, saeuo{que} gelu duramus &amp; vndis.</HI> The babes new borne to riuers cold, In frost and snow we bring, To harden them against all stormes, Into the midst we sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng. Which is the same that Sidonius writeth of the Thracians in these words: <HI>Excipit hic natos glacies, &amp; matris ab aluo, Artus infantum
<PB REF="278"/> molles nix Cambrica durat.</HI> Also Val. Flac. <HI>6.</HI> of the Scythians, <HI>vbi tam saeno durauimus amne, Progeniem, natos{que} rudes, &amp;c.</HI> Suidas, in the word Lycurgus, teacheth, that this was proper to the Lacedaemonians: as also Seneca <HI>in Suasorijs,</HI> who moreouer sayth that the riuer Eurota doth harden tender youth, to make them able to abide the better the miseries of warfare. (This custome doth yet continue amongst the Iaponians, as Mapheius witnesseth.) Caesar sayth they giue themselues to hardnesse from their childhood. If he were borne in Germany (sayth Seneca) he would forthwith being but a child, know how to handle a little iauelin. Yong men, who make it but a pastime, do cast themselues naked, sayth Tacitus, among swords and dangerous speares. The yoong men doe long abstaine from venerie; and Caesar reporteth that they esteeme it a most filthy thing to know a woman before they are twentie yeeres of age. Their marriages are seuere, they are content with one wife apiece; except a very few, which are oftener married for nobility than for lust. The husband offereth for a dowry to the wife, oxen and an horse ready bridled and sadled, with a buckler, iauelin, and sword. She is admonished by these signes of matrimony, that she commeth as a companion or consort of all labours and perils; both in peace and warre, that she is to suffer and attempt one and the same thing with her husband. Adulteries were very few, and those thus presently punished: The husband (sayth Tacitus) thrusteth his wife out of doores starke naked before her friends and kinred, with her haire quite cut off; and thus he whip∣peth her cleane thorow the towne: whereupon it is manifest that Sextus Empyrus lieth loudly, or at least Gent. Heruetus his interpreter, where he writeth, that it is no shame nor dishonesty amongst the Germans, but an ordinary thing, to commit incest and buggery. They giue not their mindes to husbandry, but all their life is hunting, that is their chiefe delight; yet Pliny writeth, that they vsually sowe oats, and ordinarily vse to eat no other pulse. Tacitus wtnesseth, that in Winter they sit all day long by the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> side. Caesar teacheth vs, that the greater part of their food consisteth of milke, flesh and cheese; and Appian sayth, that in pouerty and distresse they are content with greene herbs and sallets. Mela addeth, that they feed also vpon raw flesh. At dinner, as witnesseth Athenaeus, they bring flesh rosted in little pieces or gobbets; and vpon it they drinke milke and wine. Their dishes are simple and plaine, as venison new killed, wildings, and cast creame. Their drinke, sayth Tacitus, is a liquor made of barley or wheat. Neither is there any nation more riotous in their Innes and dayly meetings. It is accounted a shamefull thing and a great discourtesie to driue any man out of doores, or forbid any man to come to their house: neither is it a disgrace for a man to sit tipling and drinking whole dayes and nights together. Yet this is now no woonder, seeing, as Pliny sayth, drunkennesse reigneth in euery corner of the world. I maruell that Athenaeus doth not name the Ger∣mans in that his catalogue of tospots and drunken nations, or are these sober men in respect of those? The richer sort vse no loose garments, but so strait and close to their bodies, that one may tell their ribs and muscles, if they do but stirre: the rest do weare the skinnes of wilde beasts, which the ex∣terior ocean or the vnknowen sea begetteth. The very same is witnessed by Salust, who sayth that they couer their bodies with garments of skinnes: as also by Caesar: but he with Tacitus addeth, that a great part of their bodies are cleane naked. This is manifest out of these words of Isidore, <HI>Rheno∣nes</HI> are certaine vestures or couerings for the shoulders and breast downe as low as the nauill, made like a rugge of course wooll and haires, that they will keepe out a good showre of raine. Varro perhaps speaketh of these kinde of garments where he sayth, that <HI>Rheno</HI> is a French garment: and Ser∣uius vpon that of Virgil <HI>3.</HI> Georg. <HI>Et pecudum fuluis velantur corpora setis, Rhenonibus,</HI> Their vpper parts are clad in rugge, or Rhenones made of courser wooll; iustifieth the same. For as Salust sayth in his histories, garments made of skinnes or pelts are called <HI>Rhenones.</HI> It seemeth in Persius to be a kinde of beast, in this verse, <HI>Essedáque ingentes locat Caesonia Rhenos.</HI> Interpreters vpon this place do vnderstand by it the Ger∣mans, because, as they say, they do inhabit neere Rhene. But if it may be lawfull for this nation to take denomination from a riuer, it should be lawfull for them to be called rather Danubij, which runneth thorow their countrey, than of the Rheine, which belongeth as well to the French men as to the Germans. And that it is the name of a liuing creature, the siluer money of C. Rhenius doth in a maner perswade, in which a chariot with two wheeles is drawen of two beasts like goats. Olaus describeth the <HI>Reynen</HI> certaine beasts so called, which of Herbersteinius are named <HI>Rhen.</HI> Thus much by me concerning these beasts called <HI>Rhenones,</HI> let other men iudge otherwise if they please.</P>
<P>Plutarch in <HI>6. Conuiual.</HI> writeth that they weare apparell only against frost and colde of Winter. Pomponius writeth, that the men do couer them∣selues with barkes of trees. And the same man with Tacitus writeth, that they all vse a cassocke for a couering, fastened together with a button or thorne, and that in their childhood they go naked, euen in the greatest colde and dead of Winter. Neither is there any other habit for women than for men, but that the women oft times do couer themselues with linnen garments. Pliny hath noted that they also sowe flax, and that the women make cloth of it; neither do they know any finer garment than that: and that they mingle it with purple. Euery mother giueth sucke to her owne childe, neither are they committed to bondmaids and nurses. We learne out of Eusebius sixth booke <HI>de Praeparat.</HI> and out of S. Clements ninth booke <HI>de Recog.</HI> that they giue not themselues to childish things, or any thing which they thought to be vnprofitable, as namely, to stage-playes, painting, or mu∣sicke. Yet they haue giuen themselues to making of verses, but such as are rude and simple, as witnesseth the forenamed Iulian in the same <HI>Misopogo∣nos.</HI> And this is one kinde of memoriall or Chronicle with them, as Tacitus witnesseth. Otherwise they spend their whole life in warlike and milita∣ry exercises. We reade in Caesar, that robbery is not accounted as any infamy. And Seneca sayth, they take care for nothing more than for armour and weapons. In these they are bred and borne, in these they are nourished. If their countrey haue long peace, they do voluntarily go and offer their ser∣uice to those nations which do wage warre vpon any other, as Tacitus witnesseth. They procure their mothers, children and wiues to bring vnto them being in fight, incouragements and meat and drinke, neither do they feare to sucke and dresse their wounds. They begin the skirmish with singing, sound or clashing of their weapons, and dancings. They animate and encourage one another with shouting and loud hallowings. In battell they vse long speares and pikes, the weapons of the Alemans or <HI>Teutones,</HI> as Lucan in his sixth booke affirmeth. To leaue his armour behinde him in the field was accounted the greatest disgrace that might be, insomuch that many after their returne home from the warre, haue ended that infamie with an hal∣ter. Hence perhaps is that of Eusebius and S. Clement, which report, that many of the Germans do hang themselues. Dion and Herodotus say that they vsually swimme ouer riuers: for the lightnesse of their armour and the talnesse of their bodies doth lift them vp, and beare them aboue the wa∣ter, as Tacitus witnesseth. Pliny teacheth that the pirats do saile in seuerall hollow trees, whereof some one doth beare thirtie men apiece. The same man sayth that there is yet a custome with them, that the conquered giue an herbe to the conquerours. Appianus Alexandrinus sayth they contemne death, by reason that they are perswaded that they shall returne to life againe. Perhaps for that cause peraduenture it is, that Tacitus speaketh thus of them: They desire no great funerals: that only is obserued, that the bodies of famous and better sort of men may be burnt with some certeine kinde of wood. They heape vpon the fire neither garments nor any sweet sauours. Euery mans armour, and some mans horse also was cast into the fire. The sepulchre is raised with turfs, &amp;c. They haue also a certaine kinde of punishment only vsed here, as Tacitus sayth, who writeth, that they hang traitours and runnagates vpon trees, but idle and lustie fellowes (Lipsius readeth, big-limmed and lazie lubbers) they throw into puddles and fennes, casting an hardle or grate ouer them. (Caesar in his sixt booke <HI>de bello Gall.</HI> makes me imbrace that reading of Lipsius, where, if I be not deceiued, he maketh them slothfull, whom they account in the number of runnawayes, cowards and traitours: neither do I see how these differ; to accuse a man for idlenesse, and to make him infamous for slothfull dulnesse.) This is that diuersitie of punishment, according to the diuersity of offences. They vse not any sacrifices: and they count them only in the number of gods (if we may beleeue Caesar) whom they see, as the Sunne, the Moone, and Vulcan. But afterwards, as it is manifest out of Tacitus, who liued vnder Verna the Emperour, they got themselues other gods also, as Mercury, Hercules, (whom, if we may credit Lucian, they did call <HI>Ogmion</HI>) Mars, Isis, and the mother of the gods; beside one named Alcis. The same Tacitus ad∣deth, that they accounted also Velleda and Aurinia amongst the number of their gods. Suidas mentioneth this, but that he readeth <HI>Beleda</HI> for <HI>Vel∣leda.</HI> Theodosius out of Dion writeth, that the virgin <HI>Ganna</HI> gaue out oracles. He also heere maketh mention of the temple of <HI>Tanfannae.</HI> He sayth that the <HI>Sueui</HI> (which is the greatest nation of all Germany) did worship the mother Earth, which (as Lipsius readeth) they call <HI>Aërtha,</HI> which yet is called <HI>Aerde.</HI> But they haue no images. Tertullian in his <HI>Apolog.</HI> writeth (if the reading be vncorrupt) that <HI>Belenus</HI> is the god of the No∣rici. Plutarch, and out of him Clemens Alexandrinus, teacheth that they haue certaine holy women (Tacitus calleth them <HI>Agathias</HI> &amp; <HI>Polyaenus,</HI> Fortune-tellers, Prophetesses) who did tell of things to come by the roaring, wirlings, and circumuolutions of riuers. It is very like that Caesar meant these same people, which he reporteth sayd to Ariouistus, that it was not lawfull for the Germans to ouercome, if they fought before the new moone. Hither are those things to be referred which Strabo speaketh of the Prophetesses of the Cimbrians (people of Germanie) in his seuenth booke. Aeli∣an in the second booke of his <HI>Var. hist.</HI> chap. <HI>31.</HI> hath noted that they foretell things to come, euen by birds, entrals of beasts, signes, and forespeakings. Tacitus is witnesse, that they made experimentall diuinings, euen by the neying of their horses. It is manifest out of Suetonius his Domitian, that they had also Diuiners, which foretell by looking into the entrals of beasts. We reade in Tacitus, that at an appointed time they publikely sacrificed those men, and that in their consecrated groues, and by calling on the names of their gods: which I also gather out of Claudian his first booke of the praise of Stilicon, who calleth these woods, cruell by reason of their ancient religion. Tacitus also attributeth vnto these a certaine kinde of casting of lots. Iosephus in his eighth booke of Antiq. chap. <HI>8.</HI> doth tell a prety tale worth the reading, of a captiue souldier, concerning their skill in diuination by birds. And thus of many things we haue selected these few particulars of Olde Germany, which hath now a new face, farre other fashions, rites and maners than at that time it had. Caesar will affoord more to the greedy Reader, but especially Tacitus in his peculiar booke written of the Ger∣mans. Moreouer, some things thou mayest finde in a Panegyricke speech made to Aurelius Maximianus the Emperour. The Epitome of Liuie in the <HI>104.</HI> booke, witnesseth that he wrote of the situation and maners of Germanie. Caecilius reporteth, that Plinius Secundus his vncle wrote twentie books of the warres of Germanie. Agathias witnesseth that Asinius Quadratus did most curiously describe the estate of Germanie. But we hitherto
<PB REF="279"/> want all these books of Pliny and Liuy. Notwithstanding there are some men of no reputation, which bragge that they haue those bookes extant by them, and do suffer them to lie hid and fight with wormes to the great iniurie and dammage to learnings common-wealth. Of this vanquished, and yet inuincible Germanie, these men tooke their names or surnames, to wit, Nero, Claudius, Drusus, (of whom Ouid thus speaketh, <HI>Et mortem &amp; nomen Druso Germania fecit:</HI> Great Drusus was of Germane named, and there he li'th intomb'd.) Germanicus Caesar this mans sonne, Tiberius Caesar, C. Caesar, Nero, Vitellius, and Domitian; as Suetonius, Dion, Tacitus, and their coines do witnesse. Item, Nerua, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Traian, M. Aurelius Antoninus, Commodus, Carocalla, Maximinus, Maximus his sonne, Gallienus, and Claudius; as their ancient coines doe plainly teach. Aurelian also, Maximilian, Valentinian, Valens and Gratian, as ancient stones and inscriptions do testifie. Lastly, Valerius Maxi∣minus and Eusebius in his ninth booke <HI>de Histor. Eccles.</HI> do auouch the same. Insomuch that the most learned Iustus Lipsius hath rightly obserued and noted vpon the first booke of Tacitus Annals, that almost all the Emperours since Tiberius haue taken their surnames from this most warlike na∣tion. I haue a piece of brasse money in which is the picture of M. Aurel. Antoninus, with this inscription: <HI>M. ANTONINVS AVG. TR. P. XXV.</HI> on the backe side is a firre tree, neere which standeth <HI>Victorie,</HI> with a shield in which is written <HI>VIC GER.</HI> and about the verge or skirt, <HI>IMP. VI. COSS. III.</HI> It is no maruell that Germanie should be signified, by the firre tree, for it is very common and familiar to this region: and Pliny describeth the best of them all to be in the Alps; in that part or side as I coniecture which looketh toward Germany. For we haue obserued that few or none do grow, scarse in any tract of the Alps, on that side toward Italie. And this is that Germanie, with which the Romane nation waged war from the yeere six hundred and fortie after the building of Rome, Caecilius Metallus and Papirius Carbo being Consuls, euen vnto the yeere one thou∣sand one hundred and sixtie foure: at what time it was taken of the Goths, a people of Germanie, in the reigne of Honorius the Emperour. So long was this Germanie winning, that I may so speake with Tacitus, who doth freely confesse, that it was rather triumphantly conquered, than basely van∣quished. That the disposition of the countrey might the better be vnderstood, I thinke it not amisse to adde these few histories to the former. Of the <HI>SIMPLICITY</HI> of these people, out of Suetonius <HI>de Claudio.</HI> He being moued with the simplicitie and affiance of the Germans suffered their am∣bassadours to sit in chiefe roomes of the Theatre, for that being brought into the places where the comminaltie and common sort vsed to sit, they mar∣king the Parthians and Armenians to sit amongst the Senatours, they boldly on their owne accord stepped to those higher places, affirming that their valour and eondition was nothing inferiour to theirs. Here also Tacitus in his 13. Annal. speaking of the Frisian Germans, and being gone to Rome, while they wait and attend Nero's leasure, who was busied about other matters, among those things which are vsually shewed to Barbarians, they come to Pompies theatre, to see the great multitude of the people there assembled. There sitting idle (for they were delighted with playes like fooles) inqui∣ring about the sitting in the lists, differences of states, demanding which is the gentleman, which is the Senatour, they obserued some in strange appa∣rell in the seats of the Senatours: and asking who they should be, they vnderstood, that that honour was giuen to the ambassadours of those nations which did excell in vertue and friendship with the Romans, they cried out aloud, <HI>NO MORTALL MEN MAY BE PREFERRED BEFORE THE GERMANS FOR VALOVR AND FIDELITIE:</HI> they step aside, leaue their seats, and place themselues among the Senatours: which was well taken of all the beholders: being held for a token of their ancient spirit and courageous stomacke. Nero made them free of the citie of Rome. Of their <HI>SECVRITIE, ex Arria. 1. Alexand.</HI> Alexander asked the Celtae (or Germans) what thing all the world most feared? thinking that the greatnesse of his power and name had pierced as farre as the Celtae, yea and farre beyond them, that they would haue answered, that they feared him aboue all men in the world beside. But the Celtae answered him farre otherwise than he expected: to wit, that they feared lest heauen should fall vpon them, because they liued farre from Alexander, and dwelt in places hard to come to, and that they saw him make expedition another way. Ale∣xander calling them friends and entertaining them into the number of his friends and confederates, sent them home againe, adding this one thing, That the Celtae are proud and arrogant fellowes. Of their <HI>CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OVVNE STRENGTH, ex Caesar. Comment. lib. 4.</HI> The Germans sayd that they did neither first beginne warre with the Romans, neither do they refuse to answer them, if they be prouoked, and to meet them where they will assigne; because this is a custome of the Germans continued from their ancestours, to answer him whosoeuer shall proclaime war against them, and neuer to offer conditions of peace vnto their enemies. Yet to say this, that they came vnwillingly thither, being that they were cast out of house and home: if the Romans desired their friendship and amity, they might be able to stand them instead and do them good seruice: or els let them giue them lands, or at leastwise suffer them to hold those which they haue gotten with their swords. They yeeld themselues inferiour to none, but to the Sueui only, to whom they thinke the immortall gods are not equall: otherwise in earth, there is no nation whom they can not ouercome. Of their <HI>MAGNANIMITY ex L. Flor. lib. 3.</HI> What was the pride of Ariouistus king of the Germans? When the ambassadours sayd, Come to Caesar: he answered, But who is Caesar? And if he will, let him come, sayth he, himselfe, what needeth he care how our Germanie doth? Doe I meddle with Romans? But these things of Ariouistus are more largely handled by Caesar himselfe, in his <HI>1.</HI> Comm. <HI>de Bel. Gall.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PANNONIA, AND ILLYRIS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N <HI>Dion,</HI> an authour of good credit, and who sometime, it is certaine, was President of this country, I read that the <HI>PAN∣NONES</HI> were so named for that they vsed to were sleeued coats made <HI>ex pannis,</HI> that is of patches or pieces of wollen cloth, cut and slashed after their manner and fashion, not vsuall in other countries. That they were so named of the Apennine mountaines, <HI>Isidore</HI> affirmeth he hath read in some one authour or other: but sure I thinke he dreamed when he wrot this, so vnlike it is from the trueth. <HI>Ptolemey</HI> restraineth <HI>PANNONIA,</HI> their countrey, within the riuers <HI>Donaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Saw,</HI> and the mountaines <HI>Cetius</HI> and <HI>Albanus,</HI> making, as seemeth, these to be the true and naturall bounds of the same. The same in effect doth <HI>Strabo,</HI> who extended the <HI>Pannonij</HI> Westward vp as far as the city <HI>Segestica, (Segesd,</HI> the place, where it sometime stood, is yet called, as <HI>Bonfinius</HI> writeth) Northward vp as high as the riuer <HI>Ister</HI> or <HI>Donawe:</HI> South∣ward and Eastward as lowe as <HI>Dalmatia</HI> and the <HI>Sardiaei,</HI> a kinde of people dwelling betweene <HI>Moesia, Dardania</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia. Florus</HI> writeth that these Pannones are entrenched and walled, as it were, within two great forrests or wilder∣nesses and these three riuers, <HI>Dra, Saw,</HI> and <HI>Donaw. Dion</HI> saith, that they dwell and possesse all that tract of ground that is betweene <HI>Noricum, (Bauaria,</HI> or <HI>Bayern)</HI> and <HI>Moesia Europaea, (Seruia</HI> and <HI>Bosna.) Appaianus</HI> maketh them to abut Westward vpon the Iapo∣des or Iapydes, a people of <HI>Illyria</HI> now called <HI>Craner,</HI> and Eastward vpon <HI>Dardania (Bossen.)</HI> But in this he is deceiued, that he calleth these people <HI>Paeo∣nes:</HI> a common errour among the Grecian historians, which <HI>Dion</HI> in his nine and fortieth booke did first discouer: For of the Romans, and of themselues, they are called <HI>Pannonij.</HI> The <HI>Paeones</HI> are a nation diuers from these, lying betweene mount <HI>Rhodope</HI> and the marine coasts of <HI>Macedonia. Ptolemey, Strabo, Dion, Aurelius Victor,</HI> and ancient inscriptions do diuide <HI>Pannony</HI> into the <HI>HIGHER</HI> and <HI>LOVVER: Liber Notitiarum,</HI> The booke of Remembrances, into the <HI>FIRST</HI> and <HI>SECOND. Optatus Afer</HI> maketh <HI>three Pannonies:</HI> but vntruely, seeing that those aboue named, approoued au∣thours, doe describe but two: and the coine of the Emperour <HI>Decius,</HI> this countriman borne, doth mention no more. <HI>Solinus</HI> writeth, that this country is very plaine and champion, and as rich and fertile a soile as any other thereabout. <HI>Appian</HI> saith, that it is full of woods, and that it hath no cities nor townes, only the lands and fields are diuided vnto certaine farmes and families. In <HI>Hygenus</HI> I reade that a price and custome was imposed vpon these lands accor∣ding to the fertility and goodnesse of euery aker: for there were fields of the first and second price; woods yeelding yearely great plentie of maste; woods of the meanest sort of feed and pastorage. &amp;c. But <HI>Iornandes</HI> certaine ages after reporteth otherwise of this his natiue country; and affirmeth it to be beautified with many goodly cities. The people doe liue and fare as hardly as any people vnder heauen, hauing neither good ground nor good aire, nor hauing of their owne growing either oile or wine, but very little and bad, neither doe they regard to plant and set these commodities, the greatest part of the yeare being there very colde and bitter, nothing else almost but a continuall vnkinde Winter. <HI>Dion</HI> writeth, that they haue some Barley and Millet [<HI>Strabo</HI> saith, Spelt <HI>(Zea)</HI> and Millet] of which they make their bread and drinke: and withall affirmeth that he writeth not this by heare-say or relation from others, but of his owne experience and knowledge as he learned and saw at such time as he was Lieutenant there. Yet he saith they are a most stout and hardy people, but hauing nothing woorthy the name of honesty and ciuility, being generally very hasty and bloudy minded, killing and slaying without any respect or feare of God or man, and that vpon euery crosse word and light occasion. <HI>Solinus</HI> auoucheth the same to be true, saying, that this country is very strong and well furnished with couragious and stout men. <HI>Tibullus</HI> in his fourth booke, saith that they are a wily and crafty people. <HI>Statius</HI> and <HI>Paterculus</HI> called them, <HI>Feroces,</HI> fierce and cruell. But the same author doth againe asmuch commend them, not only for their great loue of military discipline: but for their skill and know∣ledge of the Latine tongue, and for that diuers of them are learned and studious of the liberall sciences. <HI>Ausonius</HI> nameth them <HI>Armiferos,</HI> a warlike peo∣ple. <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his tenth booke <HI>de Praeparat. Euangelica,</HI> giueth out that these people, especially those that dwelt about <HI>Noricum, (Bauaria,</HI> or <HI>Bayern)</HI> did first finde out the vse of copper or brasse. <HI>Herodian</HI> saith, that they are bigge bodied, very tall, ready to fight, and to kill and slay vpon euery occasion: but of so dull a conceit and simple, that they doe not easily perceiue whether one deale or speake ought craftily and subtilly, or meane well and plainly. The Panegy∣ricke of <HI>Mamertinus</HI> nameth this <HI>Pannony</HI> the Empresse of all nations for valour, and, like as <HI>Italy,</HI> renowmed for ancient honour. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith that this countrey yeeldeth great plenty of mast or akornes. The same authour also, in his historie of Nature hath left recorded, as if it were a matter of some mo∣ment, that heere the herbe <HI>saliunca,</HI> a kinde of lauender, doth naturally grow of it owne accord. <HI>Oppian</HI> commendeth the Pannonian dogges, which <HI>Ne∣mesianus</HI> in this verse affirmeth to be good hunters: <HI>Nec tibi Pannonicae stirpis temnatur origo:</HI> The hounds heere bred are not the woorst that ere I see. The Pannonian cappes made of beasts skinnes or furres, such as souldiours vse to weare, <HI>Vegetius</HI> in his booke of warre doth highly commend. This country afterward <HI>Probus</HI> the Emperour permitted to haue vines, and by the helpe of the souldiers himselfe did plant them in mount <HI>Almus (Arpatarro)</HI> neere <HI>Sermium (Sirmisch)</HI> the place where he was borne, as also vpon mount <HI>Aureus (Meczek)</HI> in <HI>Moesia superior (Seruia)</HI> as <HI>Sextus Aurelius Vi∣ctor,</HI> in his life, doth testifie. In <HI>Paeonia,</HI> a prouince heere, abbuttant vpon mount <HI>Rhodope</HI> toward <HI>Macedony</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> the soile is rich and fertile of golde, that many men haue found lumps of golde-ore of more then a pound weight. And in the confines of this country <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his <HI>Admiranda</HI> doth write, that oftentimes the earth or vpper soard being by continuall showers washed away, that kinde of golde which they call <HI>apyrum,</HI> (quicke-golde, if I may so call it, such as haue not touched the fire) is found without digging or any other labour. But heere againe I doe also obserue an error very frequent amongst the Greeke writers, mistaking <HI>Paeonia</HI> for <HI>Pannonia:</HI> For <HI>Pannonia</HI> or <HI>Hungary</HI> euen to this day is so rich of golde, that it is wonderfull and scarse to be belee∣ued of such as haue not seene it, as <HI>Bonfinius, Broderith,</HI> and <HI>Ranzan</HI> doe iointly affirme, who do all write that they haue seene very many golden twigges of vines, some as long as ones finger, others of halfe a foote long: but of the richnesse of <HI>Paeonia</HI> for mines of golde, I haue neuer heard nor read in any authour to my remembrance. <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> in the life of <HI>Pyrrhus Eliensis</HI> hath noted, that the <HI>Paeones</HI> doe vse to cast the bodies of dead men into pondes or deepe pooles. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> in his eight and thirtieth oration writeth, that the <HI>Paeones</HI> did worship the Sunne, and that the signe or idoll of the same, which they adored; was a little dish, put vpon the end of along pole and set vpright. But whether this be meant of them, or of the <HI>Pannones</HI> (for that this authour is a Grecian) I know not, I leaue it to the consideration of the learned. The like is that place of <HI>Aelianus</HI> in the twelfth chapter of his seuenth booke <HI>de Animalibus,</HI> where he writeth a discourse of the laborious painfulnesse of the women of this countrey, well worth the reading and obseruation. <HI>Tzetzes</HI> also, in the three hundred and eighteenth chapter of his tenth Chiliade, nameth the <HI>Paeones</HI> for the <HI>Pannones,</HI> where he hath something perteining to this our purpose. <HI>Antigonus</HI> in his booke <HI>de Mirabilibus,</HI> writeth that in <HI>Illyria</HI> and <HI>Pannonia</HI> is that kinde of beast which they call <HI>Monychos: Aelianus</HI> termeth it <HI>Monops:</HI> Others, <HI>Bonasus. Diaconus</HI> in the eighth chapter of his second booke of the historie of <HI>Lombardie</HI> writeth that <HI>Pannonia</HI> breed∣eth great plenty of Buffes or Bugles, <HI>(Bisontes)</HI> and that he heard of an honest old man, that fifteene men haue beene knowen to lie together vpon one buffe hide, noting thereby the huge greatnesse of this beast. And thus much of both those <HI>Pannonia's:</HI> now it remaineth that in like maner we say something of <HI>Illyris.</HI></P>
<P>This country is called of <HI>Ptolemey ILLYRIS:</HI> of <HI>Stephanus ILLYRIA, ILLYRIAE</HI> and <HI>ILLYRIVM:</HI> of Historians and Geographers <HI>IL∣LYRICVM. Valerius Maximus</HI> writeth, that one <HI>Alexander</HI> wrot a whole booke of the description of this country. It was so called, if we may giue credit to <HI>Appianus Alexandrinus,</HI> of <HI>Illyrius</HI> the sonne of <HI>Polyphemus:</HI> or <HI>Cadmon,</HI> as <HI>Apollodorus</HI> and <HI>Stephanus</HI> doe thinke. The bounds of this prouince are by diuers diuersly assigned. For <HI>Ptolemey</HI> confineth it with the Hadriaticke sea, <HI>Istria,</HI> the two <HI>Pannonies,</HI> and mount <HI>Scardus, (Marinai,</HI> they now call it.) <HI>Pliny</HI> endeth it at the city <HI>Lissus (Alesio.) Pomponius</HI> maketh it to begin at <HI>Tergestum, (Trieste,</HI> a city of <HI>Friuli,)</HI> and to end at the riuer <HI>Aea,</HI> which is neere <HI>Apollonia, (Sissopoli,</HI> a towne of <HI>Macedony</HI> in <HI>Greece.) Martianus</HI> extendeth it yet further, namely euen vp as high as the Ceraunian mountaines, as in like manner <HI>Strabo</HI> doth. <HI>Suetonius</HI> in the life of <HI>Tiberius</HI> writeth thus of the bounds of this country; <HI>ILLYRICVM,</HI> which lieth betweene <HI>Italy,</HI> and the kingdome of <HI>Noricum; (Bayern) Thrace,</HI> and <HI>Macedony,</HI> the riuer <HI>Donawe</HI> and the gulfe of <HI>Venice.</HI> And <HI>Ap∣pian</HI> he maketh it yet more large, stretching it out in length from the head of the riuer <HI>Ister, (Donawe</HI> euen vnto the Ponticke sea, <HI>(Mar Maiore.) Sex∣tus Rufus</HI> who liued in the time of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the Roman Emperour comprehendeth vnder the name of <HI>Illyricum</HI> these seuenteene prouinces: Those two of the <HI>Norici,</HI> the two <HI>Pannonies, Valetia, Sauia, Dalmatia, Moesia,</HI> the two <HI>Dacia's, Macedonia, Thessalia, Achaia,</HI> the two <HI>Epiri, Praeualis</HI> and <HI>Creta.</HI> Thus much of the name and limits of this country out of diuers authours.</P>

<P>We in this Mappe haue expressed only <HI>Ptolemey's Illyricum,</HI> which hee diuideth into two parts, namely into <HI>LIBVRNIA</HI> and <HI>DALMATIA, Liuy</HI> in his sixe and fortieth booke, according to the people and inhabitants of the same, diuideth it into three parts: of the nature of which prouince <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth in this maner: All the sea coast of <HI>Illyricum</HI> is well furnished with fit and commodious hauens: both the maine land, I meane, and the ilands neere adioyning to the same. The soile is very fertile of all maner of fruits and rich commodities, especially of oliues and strong wines. The countrey that is situate about this, is wholly mountainous, colde, and couered with snowe; so that vines are heere very rare, either in the high grounds or plaines and vallies. Where∣upon <HI>Propertius</HI> not altogether vnfitly called it <HI>Gelida Illyria,</HI> Bleak and frozen <HI>Illyria: Appian</HI> nameth the people <HI>Incolas bellicosisimos,</HI> a most warlike and couragious people. <HI>Liuy</HI> saith that they are a very hardy nation both by sea and land: <HI>Florus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh them cruell and bloudy men, and much giuen to robbe and steale. <HI>Iulian</HI> the Emperor in his discourse <HI>de Caesaribus,</HI> testifieth plainly that they are one of the stoutest and valiantest nati∣ons of all <HI>Europe. Vegetius</HI> recordeth that there were alwaies resident in <HI>Illyria</HI> two legions called <HI>Martiobarbuli:</HI> these <HI>Diocletian</HI> and <HI>Maximinian</HI> Emperours of <HI>Rome</HI> named afterward <HI>Iouiani,</HI> and <HI>Herculei:</HI> and they were preferred before all other legions whatsoeuer. <HI>Illyricis sudant equitatibus alae;</HI> as <HI>Claudian</HI> reporteth in the commendations of <HI>Serena. Lampridius</HI> maketh them well seene and renowmed for their skill in soothsaying, and diui∣ning of euents to come, when he writeth, that <HI>Alexander Seuerus</HI> excelled this nation in that skill. <HI>Isogonus</HI> in <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth that there be a kinde of men amongst these which doe bewitch with their eies, and doe kill such as they doe beholde and looke vpon any long while together: especially such of them as haue firie eies, like those which are moued with anger, and these kind of people haue two sights in ech eye. <HI>Aelianus</HI> saith that they are great wine bibbers, and, as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> reporteth, very much giuen to drunkennesse. Of the maidens and wiues of this countrey see <HI>Varro</HI> in the sixteenth chapter of his second booke. <HI>Claudian</HI> in his second panegyricke to <HI>Stilico</HI> signifieth that they were permitted about the raigne of the latter Emperours, to haue vines, where he thus writeth: <HI>Exectis inculta dabant quas secula syluis, Restituit terras, &amp; opacum vitibus Istrum Conserit.</HI> Which was done, as seemeth, about the time of the Emperour <HI>Probus.</HI> In <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> I finde mention made of <HI>Sabaia,</HI> the drinke of the poorer sort of people, which they made of barley or wheat turned into a liquour or kinde of woort. <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> in his first booke of his Stromaton, hath recorded that these people first found out that weapon which the Romans called <HI>Pelta,</HI> a kinde of shield or target. The kine heere euery yeare doe bring two or three calues a piece, and some foure; yea some fiue or more at once: and doe giue so much milke at a meale, that euery day one cowe yeeldeth more then a large gallon. Againe, the hennes doe not lay only once a day, but some two or three egges a peece euery day, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his <HI>Admiranda</HI> plainly affirmeth. <HI>Aelianus</HI> writeth that he had heard by re∣port from others, that their goats heere are whole footed, not clouen as in other places. <HI>Pliny</HI> recordeth that heere groweth the best <HI>Gentian,</HI> a kinde of bit∣terwoort, or hearbe, whose root is of great vertue and request in physicall vses. The same authour commendeth the cockles of <HI>Illyria</HI> for their extraordinarie greatnesse. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> testifieth that heere in the high countrey far from the sea, groweth the best and goodliest Lychnis, or Rose campaine. <HI>Ouid</HI> in his se∣cond booke <HI>de Arte Amandi,</HI> doth much commend the Illyrian pitch. <HI>Theophrastus, Cornelius Celsus, Ouid,</HI> and <HI>Dionysius Vticensis,</HI> doe mention the Illyrian flower-de-luce, an hearbe, beside his beauty, of soueraigne vse in Physicke: the best of which, and that which is of greatest estimation, as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, groweth in the wildes and woods about the riuers <HI>Drilo (Drino,</HI> or <HI>Lodrino)</HI> and <HI>Narona,</HI> now called <HI>Narcuta.</HI> In <HI>Illyria,</HI> if one may beleeue <HI>Festus,</HI> in the word <HI>Hippius,</HI> euery ninth yeare they were woont to throw foure horses into the sea, as a sacrifice to <HI>Neptune,</HI> great commander of the same. <HI>Dionysius Vticensis</HI> and <HI>Caelius Apitius</HI> doe speake of <HI>oleum Liburnicum,</HI> a kind of oile made heere. The same author telleth vs of a cold spring or well in <HI>Illyria,</HI> ouer which if a man shall spread any clothes they will burne, and at length be cleane consumed. And thus much generally of <HI>Illyria:</HI> now it remai∣neth that we speake a word or two of <HI>Liburnia</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> the seuerall parts of the same: whose beginning and ending, as <HI>Florus</HI> thinketh, is at the ri∣uer <HI>Titius, (Cercha,</HI> or <HI>Polischa:)</HI> or at the city <HI>Scardona (Scardo)</HI> situate vpon the banke of that riuer, as <HI>Ptolemey, Dioscorides, Galen</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> do thinke. <HI>Liburnia</HI> is renowmed for those kinde of shippes which heere were first made and vsed, and therefore were named <HI>Naues Liburnicae:</HI> they seeme to haue beene like vnto our pinnaces or foists, light and swift of saile, and therefore were good for pirates and sea-robbers: and <HI>Vegetius</HI> in his booke of warre writeth that they were held to be the best kinde of shippes for seruice and fight vpon the sea, and therefore in warre to be preferred before any other kinde of shipping whatsoeuer: this also <HI>Appian</HI> doth confirme, who saith that for lightnesse and swiftnesse they did farre surpasse any other. And <HI>Zosimus</HI> writeth that they were as quicke of saile as those gallies that were forced and rowed with fifty oares: but in this he is deceiued, that he thinketh them to haue beene so named of a certaine city in <HI>Italy. Apitius</HI> telleth vs, as we said before, of a Liburnian oile, vsed, as seemeth, about some seruices in the kitchin. Of the iron mines in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> see <HI>Cassiodore</HI> in his third booke <HI>Variarum,</HI> dedicated to <HI>Symeon.</HI> These verses of <HI>Statius</HI> in his <HI>Siluae,</HI> doe shew that it hath also some veines of golde: <HI>Quando te dulci Latio remittent Dalmatae montes, Vbi Dite viso Pallidus fossor redit, eruto{que} Concolor auro.</HI> So doth the poet <HI>Martiall</HI> in the threescore and eighteenth Epigram of his tenth booke vnto <HI>Macer,</HI> in these words: <HI>Ibis littoreas Macer Salonas: Felix auriferae co∣lone terrae:</HI> yet <HI>Strabo</HI> plainly testifieth that they vsed no maner of mony or coines either of siluer or golde. Moreouer, he affirmeth that euery eighth yeere they make a new diuision of their lands. There are in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> as <HI>Cicero</HI> to <HI>Vatinius</HI> writeth, twenty ancient townes, which also haue gotten vnto them more than threescore other townes. The rape roote and persnep do grow of their owne accord about <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> without setting, sowing or manuring, as <HI>Athe∣naeus</HI> in his ninth booke Deipnosophiston, out of the authoritie of <HI>Posidonius,</HI> affirmeth. For so <HI>Delachampius</HI> translateth the Greeks word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, not vsed of any other writer to my knowledge. <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his often cited <HI>Admiranda,</HI> giueth vs to vnderstand that the <HI>Taulantij,</HI> a people of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> did vse of hony to make a kinde of wine: for taking the hony-combes and powring water vpon them, they presse and wring out the liquor, which they presently seethe in a great kettle and caldron, vntill the one halfe of it be consumed, then they put it into earthen vessels and so let it stand for a certaine time: lastly, they tunne it vp into barrels or treene vessels, and so they keepe it for a long time, vntill it get the true and perfect taste of a strong kinde of wine. The same authour in the same place writeth, that amongst the <HI>Ardiaei,</HI> a people of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> in the confines neere to the <HI>Autariatae,</HI> there is a great mountaine, and neere to that as great a valley, out of which water runneth in great abundance; yet not at all times, but in the spring time only: which in the day time they powre in∣to a vessell, and keepe it close within the house, at night they set it abroad in the open aire vncouered: which being done for six daies together, at last it congea∣leth, and becommeth as fine salt as may possibly be seene. <HI>Pliny</HI> in the skirts of <HI>Dalmatia</HI> placeth a caue which he calleth <HI>Senta,</HI> with a wide deepe mouth, into which if one shall cast any thing though neuer so light, and in a day neuer so calme, presently there riseth a storme like to a whirlewind. Hither peraduenture belongeth that fable of the two rocks of which <HI>Dionysius Afer</HI> speaketh. In the same countrey there is a hole called <HI>Diana's</HI> caue, in which, if one may be∣leeue <HI>Phlegon Trallianus,</HI> there are many dead bodies, the ribbes of which are more then sixteene eles long a piece. Giue him the whetstone. Thus farre of this countrie and the people of the same, collected out of the most ancient authours that are extant and haue come to our hands. Latter writers haue na∣med this <HI>Illyria, SLAVONIA,</HI> and the people or inhabitants of the same, <HI>SLAVONES, Slauonians:</HI> by which name, being reclaimed from the barba∣rous inciuility of other nations, and by holy baptisme incorporated into the body of Christs Church, in the time of <HI>Basilius</HI> Emperour of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and his sonne <HI>Leo,</HI> who succeeded him in that Empire, they are described in the eighteenth chapter of that his booke <HI>de Bellico apparatu,</HI> where he thus setteth out their nature and manner of life: It is a populous nation, able to indure all maner of miseries; heat, colde, raine, nakednesse, want of meat, drinke and other such like necessary things, they can easily abide. They were woont to be humane &amp; courteous to strangers: which hospitality they do very diligenly mainetaine and keepe euen to this day: for they alwaies vsed to shew themselues gentle and kinde to trauellers and strangers, to entertaine them friendly and courteously, and to goe with them and conduct them from place to place, to defend and keepe them safe and sound from all hurt and danger. So that if a traueller were wronged by the negligence of his host, they presently made warre vpon him, as against a publike enemy. For they held it for a great argument of fidelity, if the wrong done to a stranger were righted or any kinde of way reuenged. Moreouer, this also doth shew them to be humaine, in that they do not binde their cap∣tiues to a perpetuall seruitude, but rather they detained and kept them with them as captiues, and prescribed them a certaine set time of their seruitude, after which being expired, paying a certaine fine or peece of mony, they might if they pleased returne home to their owne countrie againe: or, if they thought good, stay still amongst them as frinds and freemen. Their women are said to be very modest aboue those of other countries: for many of them doe take the death of their husbands so heauily, that they will die with them, and one way or other make an end of their liues with them: for they cannot abide to liue as widowes alone after their husbands death, and to marry the second time that is counted a foule shame. Their ordinary fare is millet: they are very temperate and spa∣ring in their diet. Other toiles of husbandry they cannot away withall: for they loue to liue more freely and gentlemanlike: by no meanes they will be drawen with great labour and trauell to prepare great and sumptuous banquets and dainties, and then when they haue done, to eat and drinke them vp. In warre they arme themselues with two iauelings or darts a peece. Some of them also do cary great shields which they call <HI>Thyrei:</HI> for they do vse wooden bowes and shafts, whose heads they dip in a very strong poison: for whosoeuer he be that is wounded, except he presently drinke treacle or some other holsome &amp; soueraigne anti∣dote, or shall by and by cut off all the place which is wounded, that it run no further, the whole body will surely rot and perish. They doe delight to flie to steepe and craggie places, not easily to be assaulted or come vnto, and there to abide and dwell. Thus far <HI>Leo</HI> the Emperour. Of <HI>HISTRIA,</HI> which also is contained in this Mappe, thou hast a large and fine description in the twelft booke of <HI>Cassiodore</HI> his <HI>Variarum,</HI> directed to the lieutenants and gouernours of this coun∣try: where in respect of the great fertility and store of fruits that it yeeldeth, he nameth it <HI>Rauennae Campaniam,</HI> Campany of <HI>Rauenna,</HI> and the store∣house of the Emperiall city.</P>

<HEAD>ITALY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hey which vse to compare the situation of countries to other things do liken <HI>Italy</HI> to an oken leafe, as <HI>Pliny, Solinus</HI> and <HI>Rutilius</HI> haue done: or to an iuy leafe, as <HI>Eustathius.</HI> The later writers do more truly liken it to a mans legge. One in our time hath described all <HI>Europe</HI> in the form of a maiden, in whose right arme <HI>Italy</HI> is portraitured: and not vnfitly, in my opinion, if one do exactly consider the nature of the country and famous acts done in the same: for euen as the strength of the body doth for the most part shew his force and ability in this member; so this prouince in times past de∣clared to the world by this his arme, of what power all <HI>Europe</HI> the whole body is likely to be.</P>
<P>That <HI>Italy</HI> hath had diuers inhabitants, partly Barbarians and partly Grecians, it is manifest out of the ancient records both of Latines and Greekes. For at the first it was inhabited by the <HI>Aborigi∣nes, Siculi, Pelasgi, Arcades, Epei, Troiani, Morgetes, Ausones</HI> and <HI>Oenotri.</HI> And therefore it was cal∣led by diuers and sundry names: as, AVSONIA, OENOTRIA, of the people and nations possessing it: IANICVLA, of <HI>Ianus:</HI> SATVRNIA, of <HI>Saturne:</HI> and lastly, ITALIA (which it still retaineth) of <HI>Italus</HI> their King, or as <HI>Varro</HI> witnesseth of buls or oxen: for the ancient Gretians did in those daies call buls, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: and because that this country did breed and maintaine many goodly buls, it was of them called <HI>Italia:</HI> or, (as others affirme, which more regard poeticall fables) for that <HI>Hercules</HI> from <HI>Si∣cilia</HI> hither followed a worthy bull, which was named <HI>Italus.</HI> Of the Greekes also it was named HESPERIA, of <HI>Hesperus,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Atlas:</HI> or, which pleaseth others better, of <HI>Hesperus</HI> the euening starre: whereof also in old time <HI>Spaine</HI> was called <HI>He∣speria.</HI> For, for the same reason that <HI>Italy</HI> was sometime of the Grecians called <HI>Hesperia,</HI> was <HI>Spaine</HI> of the Latines called <HI>Hespe∣ria.</HI> Yet for distinction sake, <HI>Virgil,</HI> in the first and seuen bookes of his Aeneiads, calleth <HI>Italy, Hesperiam Magnam,</HI> Great <HI>Hespe∣ria.</HI> But it was also by others named by other names. For I see that of <HI>Macrobius, Dionysius Halicarnassaeus, Marcus Cato, Isaac Tzetzes &amp;c.</HI> it was called APENINA, ARGESSA, CAMESENA, TVRSENIA, SALEVMBRONA and, TAVRINA. <HI>Stepha∣nus</HI> writeth that it was called CHONIA and BRETTIA. A part also of it was called by writers of good note MAGNA GRAE∣CIA, <HI>Great Greece,</HI> of the Grecians that sometime dwelt in it. They report, as <HI>Aelianus</HI> writeth, that there haue dwelt heere so many and sundrie nations (more than in any other country of the world) by reason especially, that all times and seasons of the yeare are very mild and temperate: againe, for that the goodnesse of the soile is excellent, well watered, and very fertile of all maner of fruites, and yeeldeth great store of pastorage: <HI>Item,</HI> because it is crossed with many riuers, and hath the sea very com∣modious lying round about it, and the sea coast on all sides open, and cut into sundrie baies, inlets, creekes and hauens, seruing very fitly for the entertainment and harborough of goodly tall shippes. Lastly, the extraordinary kindnesse and humanity of the people inhabiting it, hath been a great meanes to draw others to seat themselues heere. The Italians were euer, as <HI>Iulius Firmicus</HI> witnesseth, very famous for their princely curtesie and gentlemanlike behauiour.</P>
<P><HI>Aethicus</HI> calleth this country <HI>Heauenly Italy,</HI> and <HI>The Queen of the World; Rutilius, Rerum dominam,</HI> The mistresse of all Nations: <HI>Dion Prusaeus, The most blessed and happie country of all</HI> Europe: <HI>Halicarnassaeus</HI> in his first booke, saith, that for many reasons, <HI>It is the best country of the whole World. Strabo</HI> saith, <HI>That none may sufficiently expresse in wordes the due commendati∣ons of this country, according to the worth of the same.</HI> But I thinke it not amisse to set out the praises of this country by this one commendation of <HI>Pliny,</HI> wherewith he concludeth that his famous worke which he wrote of the history of Nature. <HI>In the whole World,</HI> saith he, <HI>the cope of heauen,</HI> Italy <HI>is the most beautifull country, and of all things it doth possesse the soueraignty: it is another nurce and mother of the World, for men, women, captaines, souldiers, seruants, famous arts and occupations, worthy wittes and inuentions, commodious situation, wholesomenesse and temperature of the aire, easie accesse of all nations, many safe hauens, kind blasts of windes, sufficient good water, pleasant and healthfull woods, goodly hils and mountaines, great store of deere and wild beasts, and those harmelesse, fertility of soile, and multitude of people. Whatsoeuer is necessarily required for the main∣tenance of man and beast is heere to be found, and no where better. Corne, Wine, Oliues, Wooll, Linnen, Woollen and Bullockes. Neither did I euer see better horses, or more esteemed at the runnings or horse-races, than those bred in our owne country. For met∣tals, as Gold, Siluer, Copper and Iron, (so long as they pleased to search for them) it was inferiour vnto none, all which it still re∣taineth in her wombe. Now it yeeldeth all maner of liquors of sundrie force and vertue, together with all sorts of graine and pleasant toothsome fruites.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Pliny.</HI> You may adde to these, if you please, that which the same authour writeth in the fifth chapter of his third booke: <HI>Item,</HI> that of <HI>Polybius</HI> in his second booke: of <HI>Varro</HI> in the second chapter of his first booke of Hus∣bandrie: of <HI>Strabo</HI> neere the end of his sixth booke; and lastly of <HI>Virgil</HI> in diuers place. <HI>Si factum certa mundum ratione fate∣mur, Consiliumquè Dei machina tanta fuit:</HI> If that we shall confesse that heauen by heauenly skill was rais'd, And in the same the massie globe by due proportion pais'd: as <HI>Rutilius</HI> in his second booke speaketh of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Octauianus Augustus,</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifieth, diuided this country into eleuen shires: <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, as <HI>Rubeus,</HI> in his second booke of the history of <HI>Rauenna,</HI> saith, into seuenteen. Or, into eighteen, as I read in the one and twentieth chapter of the second booke of <HI>Diaconus</HI> his history of <HI>Lombardy. Aelianus</HI> writeth that it was beautified in his time, with 1197. cities. This is that same countrie, which, when word was brought of the rising of the Gauls, at what time as <HI>L.

<HEAD>ITALY of the GAVLS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His part of <HI>Italy</HI> in times past was called <HI>Gallia.</HI> For the old writers did extend the borders of <HI>Gallia</HI> from the ocean sea eastward euen to the riuer <HI>Rubicon (Runcone</HI> or <HI>Rugoso)</HI> There∣fore the Alpes running through the middest of it diuideth it into two parts: this they call TRANSALPINA, and <HI>Gallia vlterior, Gallia</HI> beyond the Alpes, or the further <HI>Gallia:</HI> this which we haue heere set out in this mappe, CISALPINA, <HI>Subalpina</HI> and <HI>Citerior, Gallia</HI> on this side the Alpes, vnder the Alpes, or the hither <HI>Gallia. Ausonius</HI> nameth it <HI>Gallia the Old;</HI> so doth <HI>Solinus,</HI> where he writeth that the <HI>Vmbri</HI> are an ancient issue and branch sprong from the old Gauls. <HI>Liuy</HI> in his 45. booke nameth it <HI>Gallia,</HI> without any addition. And for that all this part, in processe of time was comprehended vnder the name of <HI>Italy:</HI> therefore of <HI>Appian</HI> in his <HI>Annibalica,</HI> it is called by a fit name, to distinguish it from that other part, ITALIA GALLICA. The booke of records of the Prouinces nameth it, ITALIA MEDITERRANEA <HI>Midland Italy.</HI> In this part was also conteined that prouince, which was called GALLIA TOGATA. Moreouer this was named ARI∣MINIVM, as you may read in the 28. booke of <HI>Liuies</HI> Decades, except the place be corrupt. <HI>Silius Italicus,</HI> in his 9. booke, calleth the people of this place, <HI>Celtes, dwelling vpon the riuer Eridanus</HI> or <HI>Po.</HI> In this circuite of ground (which <HI>Tacitus</HI> nameth the most flourishing side of <HI>Italy</HI>) are the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Eleuenth shires of <HI>Italy,</HI> according to the diuision of <HI>Augustus.</HI> This selfe same tract is of the riuer <HI>Padus (Po)</HI> which watereth it, and diuideth it in the middest, diuided into two parts, namely, GALLIA TRANSPADANA and CISPADANA, <HI>Gallia beyond the Po,</HI> and <HI>Gallia on this side the Po.</HI> This later, <HI>Cispadana</HI> alone, in <HI>Ptolemey</HI> doth conteine that which otherwise was called <HI>Toga∣ta.</HI> Vnder this diuision were the <HI>Ligures</HI> comprehended: who, as we haue obserued in ancient writers, long since dwelt vp as high as the riuer <HI>Po.</HI> If there be any credit to be giuen to the <HI>Origines,</HI> a booke which commonly goeth vnder the name of <HI>Cato,</HI> this same prouince was also called AEMILIA, FELSINA, AVRELIA and BIANORA. <HI>Polybi∣us</HI> saith, that the forme of this whole tract of <HI>Gallia,</HI> is triangular or three cornered: whose toppe or <HI>vertex,</HI> as the Geo∣metricians call it, is made by the meeting of the Alpes and Apenninus, that mountaine that runneth through the mid∣dest of <HI>Italy</HI> from one end to the other. The base or ground line, is the Hadriaticke sea <HI>(Golfo di Venetia).</HI> Moreouer he addeth that in it are the greatest champion plaines and most fertile fields of all <HI>Europe.</HI> It is euery where full of woods, good pastorage for the feeding of cattell, and well watered with many pleasant brookes and riuers, and hath had in it twelue great and goodly cities, so built and seated that they had all things necessary either for the enriching of them∣selues conueniently, or maintenance and prouision for to liue gallantly, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> doth witnesse in the life of <HI>Camillus.</HI> The same also <HI>Pliny</HI> doth affirme, who in like maner saith that it is three cornered: and as in <HI>Delta,</HI> a prouince of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the riuer <HI>Nilus:</HI> so heere <HI>Po,</HI> doth emptie it selfe and falleth into the ocean sea. Which riuer <HI>Po,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> saith, doth water this plaine, maketh it fertile, and also distinguisheth it by many most fruitfull hils, into diuers and sun∣drie parts. This is that riuer which antiquity called <HI>Eridanus,</HI> famous for the poeticall or fabulous story of <HI>Phaëton. Virgil</HI> calleth it, <HI>The king of Riuers. Claudian</HI> giueth it the title of <HI>Oloriferus,</HI> the swanne-bearing streame. <HI>Pliny</HI> nameth it <HI>Auriferum,</HI> the golden streame, and moreouer saith, that for clearenesse it is not inferiour to any riuer whatsoeuer. It issueth out of the bosome of <HI>Vesulus, (Veso)</HI> the highest hill of all the Alpes: where first arising out of many small fountaines, it draweth to head, then hiding it selfe or running vnderneath the ground for many furlongs together, at last riseth againe not farre from <HI>Forum-Vibij</HI> or <HI>Vibi Forum.</HI> From thence (many huge lakes emptying tnemselues into it) accompanied with thirty other riuers, it vnladeth it selfe by manie mouthes into the Hadriaticke bay or Gulfe of <HI>Ve∣nice:</HI> into which it falleth so swiftly and with such violence, that forcing backe the billowes and tide, it keepeth his own channell in the sea, and, as <HI>Pomponius</HI> speaketh, maketh the waters fresh and potable amid the brackish surges of the same. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, that in the Ligurian language it was named <HI>Bodincus,</HI> that is, (as <HI>Scepsius</HI> there doth interpret it) Bottomlesse. In these quarters, amongst others, the Gauls did sometimes dwell, who first of all mortall men made war vpon the Romanes, tooke the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> sacked and burnt it, the Capitoll onely being preserued vntouched. This is that part of <HI>Italy,</HI> which, as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth to his familiar friend <HI>Iunius Mauricus,</HI> retaineth euen to this day much of that ancient frugality and good husbandrie of our ancestours. In the fifth booke of <HI>Straboes</HI> Geographie, and in the second booke of <HI>Polybius</HI> history you haue an excellent and large description of this country. Of <HI>Venice,</HI> a shire of this prouince, read <HI>Cassiodore</HI> in the foure and twentieth section of his twelfth booke. <HI>Bonauentura Castilloneus</HI> and <HI>Gauden∣tius Merula,</HI> borne heere, in this our age haue much graced and painted out this part in their learned writings, and se∣uerall tracts written of the same. They which are delighted with tales and fables, let them repaire to <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who, in his booke intituled <HI>Admiranda,</HI> hath certaine things of the <HI>Electrides,</HI> (a few small ilands supposed by the ancients to be in this Gulfe, but falsly as we haue shewed before) and of Dawes or Choughs which do stocke vp the seed new sowen. Of these also <HI>Theopompus</HI> speaketh in the sixteenth chapter of the seuenteenth booke of <HI>Aelian de Animalibus.</HI></P>
<P>Of LIGVRIA, heere some thing might well be said, if so be that this mappe did containe it all: but because a piece of it only is heere expressed (for in time past as good authours do record, it extended his borders beyond <HI>Marseilles</HI> and the riuer <HI>Eridanus,</HI> or <HI>Po</HI>) therefore of it we will surcease to speake much in this place. Only I will set downe an ancient inscription cut in a plate of brasse, found in this prouince long since, for that it conteineth many names of places of the precinct of <HI>Genua,</HI> mentioned in this mappe and no where else read in any authour whatsoeuer. And for that the anti∣quity of it (although I suspect that also) is the greatest matter to be admired, I will only set it downe in the same maner as it was deliuered by <HI>Ortelius.</HI> Thus it is expressed word for word by <HI>Stunica:</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He length of this country is bounded by two riuers; with <HI>Tiber</HI> on the East: and <HI>Macra (Magra)</HI> on the West: on the South it hath the Tuscane sea (<HI>Mare Tuscum,</HI> or <HI>Tyrrhenum;</HI> now <HI>mar Tosco</HI>) For although, as <HI>Liuy</HI> and <HI>Polybius</HI> do testifie, before the Romane Empire it was more large, and extended his bounds beyond the Appenine mountaines, euen as farre as <HI>Atria (Atri)</HI> whereof the Atreaticke sea, (<HI>Hadriaticus sinus,</HI> the bay of <HI>Hadria, Golfo di Venetia</HI>) tooke the name: yet afterward being expelled and driuen from thence by the Gauls, it was conteined within these bounds. Of those eleuen prouinces into which all <HI>Italy</HI> was by <HI>Augustus</HI> diuided, as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifieth, this was the seuenth. The <HI>Origines,</HI> a booke which commonly goeth vnder <HI>Catoes</HI> name, do diuide this countrie into the <HI>Maritima,</HI> (that part which coasteth along the sea, and is of <HI>Vopiscus</HI> in the story of <HI>Aurelia∣nus</HI> said to be fertile and full of woods) the <HI>Transciminia,</HI> beyond the mount <HI>Ciminus (Monte viterbo)</HI> and the <HI>Lartheniana,</HI> so named of the city <HI>Larthenium. Iornandes</HI> and <HI>Ammianus</HI> in his 26. booke doth make mention of <HI>Anno∣naria Etruria,</HI> about the towne <HI>Pistorium (Pistoia.)</HI> Moreouer, <HI>Lib. de Limitib.</HI> speaketh of <HI>Etruria Vrbicaria.</HI> Was not this a∣bout the city of <HI>Rome? Dionysius Halicarnassaeus</HI> in his sixth booke writeth that it was diuided into 12. Dukedomes: <HI>Liuy</HI> in his first booke calleth them people (<HI>populos</HI> hundreds, tribes) at which it seemeth <HI>Virgill</HI> did aime, where he thus writeth, <HI>Gens illi triplex populi subgente quaterni.</HI> Three Nations great <HI>Etruria</HI> do possesse, foure tribes ech nation it contein'd. Out of the which chusing one king in common, ech people sent their seuerall sergeants, to attend vpon him. <HI>Seruius</HI> nameth them <HI>Lucumones,</HI> at the second booke of <HI>Virgils Georgickes,</HI> and would haue the word to signifie kings: yet <HI>Festus</HI> saith that they are men so called of their madnesse, for that they make all places where they come vnluckie and vnfortunate. In the forenamed <HI>Origines,</HI> they are called twelue colonies; and are thus recited in order, <HI>Ianiculum, Arinianum</HI> vpon <HI>Tiber, Phesulae,</HI> and another <HI>Arinianum</HI> vpon <HI>Arnus, Phregenae, Volce Volaterra, Cariara</HI> otherwise named <HI>Luna</HI> vpon the shore, <HI>Ogygianum, Aretium, Rosellae,</HI> and <HI>Vol∣sinium</HI> within the land. <HI>Volaterranus</HI> reckoneth them vp by these names and in this order: <HI>Luna, Pisae, Populonia, Volaterra, A∣gyllina, Fesulae, Russellana, Aretium, Perusia, Clusium, Faleria</HI> and <HI>Vulsinia.</HI> An ancient monument of stone, yet remaining at <HI>Vulsinium (Bolsena)</HI> as <HI>Onyphrius</HI> affirmeth, maketh mention of fifteen Hundreds of <HI>Etruria.</HI></P>
<P>The country hath been called by diuers names. For out of <HI>Pliny</HI> we learne that it was first named VMBRIA: who withall af∣firmeth that the <HI>Vmbri</HI> were throwen out of it by the <HI>Pelasgi,</HI> and thereupon it was called PELASGIA. These the <HI>Lydi</HI> did expell as the same <HI>Pliny</HI> with <HI>Trogus</HI> doth witnesse, of whose king <HI>Tyrrhenus</HI> it was intituled TYRRHENIA, as <HI>Paterculus, Halicarnas∣saeus, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Liuy</HI> haue left recorded. Soone after that, of the ceremony of sacrificing, it was called in the Greeke tongue TVSCIA. It was also named, as the same <HI>Halicarnassaeus</HI> writeth RASENA, of a certaine Duke or Generall of that nation: In <HI>Myrsilus,</HI> if I be not deceiued, it is corruptly written <HI>Rasenua.</HI> Moreouer it was called COMARA and SALEVMBRONE, if we will beleeue the feined <HI>Berosus, Annius,</HI> and such like fabulous writers. The <HI>Phocenses,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Clio</HI> writeth, sometime possessed it. The fragment of <HI>Antonius</HI> neere the lake <HI>Arnus</HI> maketh mention of the Phocenses, and the lake Phocensis. <HI>Halicarnassaeus</HI> also in his first booke saith that the <HI>Siculi</HI> did inhabite it before the entrance of the <HI>Pelasgi.</HI></P>
<P>The nature of the soile is very fertile of all maner of things, yea of vines especially, as <HI>Halicarnassaeus</HI> hath giuen out. The large champion plaines, diuided into seuerall by-hils and mountaines, are well manured and very fruitfull, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> witnes∣seth. It is very woody, good pastorage and well watered with many pleasant streames, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> iustifieth. <HI>Martianus</HI> saith that for fertility of soile it was euer renowmed and of great estimation: which fertility is no small meanes to draw the people to giue themselues ouermuch to pleasure and ease: for they are, as the same <HI>Halicarnassaeus</HI> writeth, very fine in their apparell and dainty in their diet both at home and abroad: who indeed beside things necessarie, do carrie about with them, euen when they go to warre, diuers fine things most curiouslie wrought onlie for pleasure and delight. <HI>Eustathius</HI> calleth it a robbing, cruell and vnciuill nation. <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his 2. booke <HI>de praeparati. Euang.</HI> saith that they were much giuen to Necromancie. <HI>Arnobius</HI> in his 7. booke <HI>contra Gentes,</HI> maketh it the mother and nurce of superstition. They were alwaies counted very religious, and so were the first that found out sacrifices, diuinations, and soothsayings, from whom also the Romanes receiued these vaine and super∣stitious arts: as also the <HI>Sella curulis</HI> (coach of estate) <HI>paludamenta, trabea,</HI> (the rich robe) <HI>toga pretexta, toga picta, fasces, secures,</HI> (hatchets) <HI>litui, apparitores, curcules, annuli, annuli,</HI> (rings) musick, &amp; the <HI>ludiones</HI> (whifflers.) Lastly, all their ornamēts of triumph &amp; robes of the Consuls, or rather, (that I may vse the words of <HI>Florus</HI>) all the brauery &amp; badges wherewith the honorable estate of the Empire was graced &amp; set out. <HI>Cassiodore</HI> in the 15. section of his 7. book doth attribute to them the inuentiō of the casting and working of statues of brasse. Heere hence it arose that the Romans first committed their children to the <HI>Etrusci,</HI> to be taught &amp; brought vp, as afterward they vsed to do to the Grecians, as you may read in <HI>Liuy, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus.</HI> That the flute <HI>(tibia)</HI> was the inuention of the <HI>Tyrrheni,</HI> by which they did not only fight, but also whip their seruants, yea and to seeth, <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> doth cite out of <HI>Aristotle.</HI> Of them <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the 8. booke of his <HI>Conuiual.</HI> writeth, that by an ancient statute they v∣sed to disperse their couerleds and blanckets when they rose out of their beds in the morning. <HI>Item,</HI> taking of their pots off the fire, they left no print thereof in the ashes, but did alwaies rake them abroad. They neuer would suffer any swallowes to come within their house. They might not go ouer a broome. They would keep none in their house that had crooked nailes vpon his fingers. Yet <HI>Thimon,</HI> in the 12. booke of <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> his <HI>deipnosophiston,</HI> calleth them voluptuous and licentious liuers, and none of the best report for their conuersation: heereof you may see manie examples if you take anie delight in such stories. The like you may read in his 4 booke. But I cannot omit this one thing which <HI>Heraclides</HI> in his Politicks doth recite: namely, that if anie man be so farre in debt that he is not able to paie, the boies do follow him holding vp vnto him, in mockery, an emptie purse. The <HI>Etrusci</HI> were long since accounted verie wealthie. They were very strong both by sea and by land: and in warre e∣quall in strength to the Romanes. <HI>Liuy</HI> (to whom <HI>Diodorus</HI> doth subscribe) saith it is the richest prouince of <HI>Italy</HI> both for men, munition and money. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the life of <HI>Camillus,</HI> saith, that this countrie did reach from the Alpes Northward as high as the Hadriaticke sea, and Southward as low as the midland sea. That there were 300. cities of the <HI>Vmbri,</HI> battered and taken by the <HI>Tusci,</HI> we find recorded, saith <HI>Pliny.</HI> Such was the wealth and command of <HI>Etruria,</HI> that it did not onlie filll the land with an honourable report and fame of their name, but also euen the sea all along from one end of <HI>Italy</HI> to the other. <HI>Liuy</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> do affirme that <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Atri</HI> were colonies of the <HI>Tusci; Pomponius</HI> and <HI>Paterculus</HI> do say the like of <HI>Capua:</HI> as also of <HI>Nola,</HI> although that <HI>Solinus</HI> doth ascribe this to the Tyrians (where I thinke the copie is corrupt, and for <HI>Tyrijs,</HI> I suppose it should be written <HI>Tyrrhenis) Trogus</HI> and <HI>Silius Ital cus</HI> do affirme it to haue been built and first peopled by the <HI>Chaldicenses.</HI> Yea <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his treatise of famous women, and againe in his Gretian questions, saith, that these <HI>Etrusci,</HI> in old time did possesse <HI>Lemnos, (Stalamine)</HI> and <HI>Imbrus (Lembro)</HI> certaine ilands in the <HI>Archipelago</HI> or Aegean sea.</P>
<P><HI>Tuscus vicus,</HI> a street in <HI>Rome: Tusculum</HI> and <HI>Tusculanum,</HI> in <HI>Latium (Campagna di Roma)</HI> tooke their names from hence; Againe <HI>mare Tuscum,</HI> called otherwise <HI>mare Inferum, Notium, Tyrrhenum,</HI> and <HI>Liburnum,</HI> (the Neather sea, or South sea, in respect of the Hadriaticke sea which is called <HI>mare Superum,</HI> the vpper sea, and is vpon the North from this countrie) as we find in <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Cicero.</HI> About <HI>Puteoli (Pozzole)</HI> as <HI>Dion</HI> recordeth, there is a creeke of the sea called <HI>Tyrrhenus sinus,</HI> the bay of <HI>Tuscane.</HI> But there are also other <HI>Tusci,</HI> diuerse from these in <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> as <HI>Ptolemey</HI> noteth: as also other Tyrrheni, in the ilands belonging to <HI>Attica,</HI> if you will beleeue <HI>Marsylus Lesbius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LATIVM.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>ATIVM, which the excellent Poet Virgil syrnameth The Great, The Faire, and The Western, by the description of Augustus, who, as Pliny testifieth, diuided Italy in eleuen shires, the chiefe and principall of the rest, was twofold, to wit, Latium The New, and Latium The Old. LATIVM VETVS, <HI>Olde Latium,</HI> beganne at the riuer Tiber, and extended it selfe euen vp as high as the Circaeian mountaines (or to Fundi, as Seruius sayth.) LATIVM NOVVM, <HI>New Latium,</HI> from hence stretched it selfe vnto the riuer Liris, as Pliny and Strabo do ioyntly testifie: yea and farther, as they both affirme: For euen as low as Sinuessa, (which was otherwise also called Sinope) being in that part which is named <HI>Adiectum Latium,</HI> the same Pliny calleth Latium beyond the Liris, which is indeed a part of Campania. Which peraduenture was the rea∣son that moued Seruius to extend this Latium as farre that way as the riuer Vulturnus. So that the bounds of this Latium are the Tyrrhen sea, the mount Apenninus, the riuers Tiber, Anio, and Liris. The neighbour Nations inhabiting round about it are the <HI>Tusci, Sabini, Marsi, Samnites, Praegutiani,</HI> and the <HI>Campani.</HI> It was so named of the Verbe <HI>Lateo,</HI> signifying To lurke or Lie hid; for that Saturnus here did hide himselfe, as Seruius writeth: and in trueth before him Herodianus, Eutropius, Cyprianus, and Minutius Felix do plainly affirme the same; yea and that Poet, which in all mens opinions is counted the best, in these his verses. <HI>Primus ab aetherio venit Saturnus Olympo, Arma Iouis fugiens, &amp; regnis exul ademptis. Is ge∣nus in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, ac d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spersum montibus altis, Composuit, legèsque dedit, Latium{que} vocari Maluit, his quoniam latuisset tutus in oris.</HI> Thus Englished by M. T. Phaër: First from Olympus mount (right neere the skies) good Saturne old, When he from Ioue did flie, &amp; from his kingdome outlaw'd stood, He first that wayward skittish kinde disperst in hilles and wood, Did bring to thrift, and gaue them lawes, and all the land this way Did Latium call, for safely here long time he lurking lay. The same, another Poet, as famous as he, both for his eloquence and long exile, relating the words of god Ianus, thus reporteth: <HI>Multa quidem didici, sed cur naualis in aere Actera signata est, altera forma biceps? Noscere me duplici me possis in imagine, dixit: Nivetus ipsa dies extenuasset opus. Caussa ratis superest: Tuscum venit ra∣te in amuem, Ante pererrato falcifer orbe deus. Hac ego Saturnum memini tellure receptum, Caelitibus regnis à Ioue pulsus erat. Inde diu genti mansit Saturnia nomen: Dicta quo{que} est Latium terra latente Deo. At bona posteritas puppim formauit in aere, Hespitis aduentum testificata Dei.</HI> Prudentius also, the Christian Poet, in his booke which he wrote against Symmachus, thus writeth of Saturnus: <HI>Num melius Saturnus auos rexisse Latinos Creditur? edictis qui talibus informauit Agrestes animos &amp; barbara cor∣da virorum? Sum D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, aduenio fugiens, praebete latebras. Occultate senem, nati feritate tyranni Deiectum solio: placet hic fugitiuus &amp; exul, Vt lateam, genti atque loco Latium dabo nomen.</HI> Is't thought that Saturne did the Latines better rule, Who taught them first when as they were as wilde as horse or mule? A god I am indeed, shew where I may me hide; For I haue lost my regall crowne, by Ioues vntimely pride; And still I feare his power, I dare him not abide. If that you'll grant me leaue with you to hide my head, Latium this countrey shalbe call'd long after I am dead. So that Solinus Polyhistor did not without iust cause make this demand: <HI>Who is he that knoweth not, that of Saturnus this countrey was named both Latium and Saturnia?</HI> But if any man shall suppose these reports to be fabulous and mere Poëticall fictions, let him heare the learned Varro speake, an authour farre more ancient than all those aforenamed, who affirmeth it to haue been so named, <HI>quòd lateat inter Alpium &amp; Apennini praecipitia,</HI> for that it is hid, enclosed or conteined betweene the steepe and craggie cliffes of the Alpes and A∣penninus. But what shire, I pray you, in all Olde Italy is there, <HI>quae non aequè latet?</HI> that is not thus inuironed? If I poore goose might dare to keake amongst these well tun'd swannes, I should rather thinke it to haue gotten this name, not <HI>à latendo,</HI> of lurking, but <HI>à latitudine,</HI> of the bredth of it: For there is no other countrey of the right and ancient Italie, that betweene the sea and those mountaines doth spread it selfe more broad and wide euery way than this doth: and that the Geographicall charts and mappes of this prouince doe sufficiently approoue. But let antiquity be still beleeued, I poore foole will not impeach their credit, lest at last it turne to mine owne discredit. There are some, as Hieronymus Columna, writing vpon the fragments of the famous Poet Ennius, reporteth, which thinke that this name <HI>Saturnus</HI> is a meere Syrian word, and in that language to signifie the same that <HI>latens</HI> (that is, one that playeth least in sight) doth in Latine: And hereupon those ancients, as it were, interpreting the word, haue called that shire and countrey where the Latines dwelt, LA∣TIVM Trueth it is, and all learned in these orientall tongues can beare me witnesse, that the Hebrew thema <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Sathar,</HI> signifieth to lurke, or hide ones selfe from the presence or sight of others: which signification it constantly reteineth both in the Syrian or Chaldey, and Arabicke dialects. From hence also may analogically be formed <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Sithron,</HI> (from which by adding <HI>us,</HI> the Latine termination, is made <HI>Saturnus</HI>) like as of <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Pathar,</HI> to interpret, is made <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Pithron,</HI> an interpretation, and of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Rahama,</HI> to be mercifull or pitifull, is made <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Rahman,</HI> in the Arabian, or <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Rahmana</HI> in the Syrian tongue, a pitifull hearted man: and of <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Thirgem,</HI> to interpret out of one language into another, is framed also <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Thurgmana,</HI> an interpretour; vsed likewise by the Chaldey Paraphrast at the seuenth Psalme: as also by the Arabian interpretour of the New Testament, at the 28. verse of the 14. chapter of the first Epistle of S. Paul to the Corinthians: and vulgarly amongst the Mores, Turks, and other Orientall nations, they call an interpretour, or him who vsually attendeth strangers or trauellers vnexpert of that language a <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Turgman,</HI> or, as they commonly pronounce it, a <HI>Trugman.</HI> Obserue moreouer, that euen the word <HI>Latium</HI> it selfe, supposed to be a pure Latine deriuatiue, together with his theme <HI>Lateo,</HI> doth sauour of the Hebrew root <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Lat,</HI> of the same signification: from whence is deriued <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Lot,</HI> the proper name of Harans sonne, who with Terah his grandfa∣ther, and Abram his fathers brother, came from Vr of the Chaldees, and dwelt in the land of Canaan, Gen. 11.27.31. From the same root also, as some learned men thinke, was deriued <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Lotan,</HI> the proper name of one of the sonnes of Seir the Horite, Gen. 36.20. which commeth more neere to the Italian <HI>Latinus.</HI> But of this peraduenture we haue stood too long. That the inhabitants or people of this countrey were called <HI>Latini,</HI> Strabo with all the an∣cient writers of the Romane histories doth plainly teach vs, denominated of <HI>Latinus</HI> a king of this prouince, according to that of Virgil — <HI>genus vnde Latinum,</HI> From whom the Latines tooke their name. Pliny also maketh mention of the <HI>Latinienses,</HI> a nation of this prouince; but extinct something before his time, as he there addeth. These were called <HI>Prisci,</HI> as Halicarnasseus and Festus doe testifie. Of the nature of this countrey Strabo in the fifth booke of his Geo∣graphy writeth thus: All Latium, sayth he, generally is a very good soile and fertile of all maner of things, except only some certeine places neere the sea coast, which are morish and very vnhealthfull; as namely the fields about Ardea, and whatsoeuer is betweene Lauinium and Antium, euen as farre as Po∣metia, with some places about Setia; and others neere Tarracina and Circeium; beside all those fields that are stony and mountainous; although euen these grounds are not altogether idle and vnfruitfull: all of them hauing either some good pastures and large woods, or doe yeeld great abundance of fenny and mountainous commodities. Caecubum, a place in this fenne, doth yeeld a kinde of vine which groweth vp in height like a tree, whose wine is counted to be the best of all Italy. Heare also what Theophrastus writeth of this prouince in the fift booke of his history of Plants, at the ninth chapter of the same booke: <HI>Latinus ager,</HI> the countrey of Latium, sayth he, hath great plenty of water. The champion plaines haue great store of laurell and myrtle trees: item they yeeld a wonderfull kinde of beech (<HI>scissima,</HI> he calleth it, or <HI>oxea,</HI> as others terme it) of that maruellous length, that one tree may serue for a whole keele for such kinde of ships as they commonly vse in Etruria. The hilly and mountainous places doe beare the pine and firre trees. Pliny doth highly commend the wines of Latium, <HI>(Latiniensia vina.)</HI> The same authour affirmeth that their chiefe meat was <HI>far,</HI> that is, a kinde of bearded or redde wheat; and withall, testifieth that it is certaine that the Romans for a long time together liued with <HI>puls,</HI> by which they vnderstand all maner of corne beside wheat and barley, not with bread. How populous this countrey was, how many cities and people it conteined, the same authour doth teach vs, where he writeth that in Old <HI>Latium</HI> only three and fiftie nations are vtterly decayed and extinct without any mention at all remaining of their names. Item, that <HI>Pomptina palus,</HI> the fen Pontina (now called <HI>Aufente palude</HI>) a part also of this countrey, had in former times in it three and twentie cities. Of all the cities of Latium, in olde time Alba longa was the chiefe and metropolitan: but afterward Rome, which grew to that greatnesse and power that it was not only the head of this prouince, but also euen of the whole world beside. Whose other name, because it is held an vnlawfull thing to speake that which is concealed and enrowled in cere∣monious mysteries, I will not vtter, lest with Valerius Soranus, I be worthily punished for the same. Yet the syrnames, epithets, and commendable titles where with it was graced and set out by the best writers of all nations, if I shall here reckon vp, I hope there is no man, that is an indifferent Iudge, that will blame me.

<HEAD>CIRCAEIVS MONS, Now MONTE CIRCELLO.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Liny and Pomponius Mela call this mountaine CIRCEIVM MONTEM: Strabo and Ptolemey CIRCAEVM. but an ancient inscri∣ption in this same place calleth it CIRCAEVM, denominated as ancient writers affirme of <HI>Circes,</HI> the famous sorceresse, who sometime dwelt here, as they verily beleeued. Whereupon Mela and Solinus, as also Ouid himselfe, nameth it <HI>Circes domum,</HI> Circes house. Item Ap∣pollonius in like maner calleth it Circes habitacle, &amp; Ae AE AE <HI>portum,</HI> (with three diphthongs, as Seruius obserueth in Virgil) the Aeaean hauen. It was so called, as the same Grammarian writeth, of a contemptuous word vsed by those which passed by that way, which they vttered in contempt of those her witchcrafts &amp; sorceries, whereby she turned men into swine, practised in this place. This was long since an iland, and inuironed round with the ocean sea, but now by continuance of time it is ioyned to the continent, as Solinus testifieth. The like doth Pliny affirme of it; It was, sayth he, sometime inclosed round with the maine sea, as Homer seemeth to thinke, but now it standeth vpon the firme land. But was not Homer deceiued? surely so Procopius, in the first booke of his <HI>Gothica,</HI> seemeth to thinke. Of the mountaine <HI>Circeius,</HI> sayth he, where they report Vlysses had conference with the enchantresse <HI>Circe,</HI> as I thinke, they speake many things that are not true: except that peraduenture one might say that this mountaine was therefore an iland, for that it shooteth out an huge way into the vast ocean &amp;c. And although that Homer heere hath Theophra∣stus, in his history of Plants, and Seruius in his Commentaries vpon Virgils Aeneides, vpon his side, as Patrons of fabulous antiquity, yet that I should rather leane vnto Procopius, the opinion of the learned M. Isaac Casaubon, who in those his laborious Commentaries vpon the Geography of Strabo hath obser∣ued, that oft times amongst the best Geographers, Ilands and Promontories are confounded, and one put for another: so that that which one authour termeth a promontory, another calleth by the name of an ile or a neckland. Therefore I do willingly preferre the description of Strabo of this place, before those descriptions of any other authours whatsoeuer, as more true and probable. From Antium, sayth he, two hundred foure score and ten furlongs, is situ∣ate mount Circello <HI>[Circaeum]</HI> an hill inuironed partly with the sea and partly with moorish fennes and bogges. Those things also which the Poets do tell of the witchcraft of the sorceresse Circe, and that fabulous transmutation and changing of men into diuers and sundry formes or shapes, with Seruius I doe ra∣ther attribute to the force of nature, than to magicke or witchcraft. namely, of the horrour of those which passe by that way, whereby men do seeme to be changed into beasts. and with Pliny I may say, How infinite are those fables that are tolde of Medea of Colchis, and others, but especially of our Italian Circe, who for her excellent skill in the arte magicke was canonized for a goddesse? And be it farre from me, and from euery Christian man, that we should beleeue those things which it were wicked and profane to thinke or imagine. For I haue read in the Ancyrane councell, that they are woorse than Pagans and infidels, who doe beleeue that any creature may by any man be turned and transformed into any other shape or similitude, than by the Creatour him∣selfe, who first gaue them that forme and fashion. Therefore let all other men say what they will, and perswade what they can, they shall neuer make me be∣leeue these fables. It seemeth that the fable arose of the nature and quality of the place. for those places which lie out into the sea, as this promontory doth, are woont to be in more danger of storme and windes than any other places whatsoeuer. Which blasts, accompanied with the waues, ebbes and tides of the sourging sea, falling vpon the rocks, cliffes and hollow places, do cause such sundry sounds and noices, that such as doe saile by this way, not without a great horrour and trembling, doe seeme as if they heard at one instant men mourne, lions roare, wolues howle, dogs barke, hogs grunt, and beares to make a noice. Hither do those words of Lucan in his sixt booke belong; <HI>Omnia subducit Circaeae vela procellae.</HI> That this promontory is full of trees, especially of okes, myrtles, and bay-trees, Theophrastus writeth from the relation of others. Strabo sayth that it aboundeth with diuers sorts of roots: peraduenture, as there he addeth, they affirme this of it, that they may the better apply it in all respects vnto the fable of Circe. And do you not thinke that this saying of Aristotle the Prince of Philosophers, in his <HI>Admiranda,</HI> did arise from hence? They report, sayth he, that in the mount Circello there groweth a deadly poison, of such great force, that so soone as euer it is taken, all the haire of the body immediatly falleth off, and it so weakeneth all the parts and members of the same, that they wex so litly and dwined, that outwardly they beare the shew of dead carkeises, such as it would grieue any man to beholde. Strabo writeth that in this mountaine was an altar dedicated to Minerua. and withall there is to this day to be seene a certeine goblet or bowle of Vlysses. but this latter he affir∣meth to be from the opinion and report of the vulgar sort only. But passing ouer these fables, let vs returne againe vnto the historicall narration of such things as in trueth are either here found or haue happened in this place. Horace hath left recorded, that the sea vpon this coast yeeldeth great store of good oisters, which thereof are called <HI>Ostrea Circaeia.</HI> Suetonius reporteth that Marcus Lepidus was by Augustus Caesar for euer confined and banished into this place. Plutarch writeth that Iulius Caesar had a purpose, hard beneath the city, by a deepe channell to conuey the riuer Tiber another way, and to turne the course thereof toward this <HI>Circaeium promontorium,</HI> and so to haue caused it to fall into the sea, at the city Anxur: by which meanes those which for trade and trafficke were by ship to trauell vp to Rome, he meant to make their passage more easie and safe; but being preuented by death, performed not what he had purposed. Here also was the city CIRCAEIVM or <HI>Circaeia,</HI> or as Strabo termeth it <HI>Circes towne.</HI> That it was made a colony of the Romans by Tarqui∣nius, Liuy, Halicarnasseus, Cicero and Plutarch, do ioyntly testifie. Strabo sayth that it hath a good and conuenient hauen. I would thinke that the menti∣on or plot of this ancient citie <HI>Circaeia</HI> doth still remaine in this mountaine in that place where in this description thou seest certeine ruines and foundations of the walles, as it were of a city rased long since and layd leuell almost with the ground: which place at this day is called by the name of <HI>Citta vecchia,</HI> that is as much to say, as, The old citie. Certeine remnants of this name doth yet remaine to be seene engrauen in the top of this same mountaine, as Angelus Bre∣uentanus, a man of good credit, the authour of this description, and a most diligent searcher out of the Romane antiquities, doth from his owne know∣ledge plainly testifie, yet much defaced, as he also affirmeth, and worne out with continuance of time, to wit, in this forme;

<HEAD>MAGNA GRAECIA, OR GREAT GREECE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat a great part of the true and ancient <HI>Italy</HI> (if not all of it) together with all <HI>Sicily</HI> was sometime called by the name of GREAT GREECE, I thinke there is no man meanly seen in Geographie that maketh any doubt: for the <HI>Grecians</HI> did in former times possesse, as <HI>Trogus</HI> writeth, not only a part, but welnigh all <HI>Italy.</HI> Listen what <HI>Pliny,</HI> in the fifth chapter of his third booke, saith, Of it the Gre∣cians, a Nation very prodigall in commending themselues, haue giuen their verdict, in that they haue named a great part of it <HI>Great Greece.</HI> Hither also pertaine those wordes of <HI>Festus. Italy</HI> was cal∣led <HI>Great Greece,</HI> because the <HI>Siculi,</HI> sometime passed it, or for that many and the greatest cities of it, were built by the Grecians. <HI>Seruius</HI> in his Commentaries vpon the first of <HI>Virgils</HI> Aeneids, writeth thus: <HI>Italy</HI> was termed <HI>Megale Hellas,</HI> Great <HI>Greece,</HI> for that all the cities from <HI>Taranto, (Tarentum)</HI> euen vnto <HI>Cumae,</HI> were first founded by the Grecians. And therefore it was not altogether vnfitly of <HI>Plautus</HI> in his <HI>Menechmis,</HI> called <HI>Graecia exotica,</HI> outlandish <HI>Greece. Seneca,</HI> in his Consolation, thus speaketh of it: All that side of <HI>Italy,</HI> which coasteth along with the Neather sea <HI>(Mar Tosco)</HI> was called <HI>Great Greece.</HI> That <HI>Campania (Terra di lauoro)</HI> was possessed by the Grecians, <HI>Pliny</HI> doth plainly affirme. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> in his six and twentieth Oration describeth <HI>Auernus lacus,</HI> the lake of <HI>Tipergola,</HI> in <HI>Campania,</HI> to be within the compasse of <HI>Great Greece.</HI> And that these authours speake truth, <HI>Trogus</HI> par∣ticularly sheweth in the twentith booke of his history, in these wordes: The <HI>Tusci</HI> which dwell along by the coast of the Neather sea, came from <HI>Lydia: Item,</HI> the Venetians <HI>(Veneti)</HI> which now we see to be seated neere the vpper-sea, <HI>(Golfo di Venetia,</HI> the Hadriaticke sea) <HI>Troy,</HI> when it was taken and sacked, sent thither vnder the conduct of <HI>Antenor:</HI> moreouer, the city <HI>Adria (Atri)</HI> which first gaue name to the Adriaticke sea, neere neighbour vnto the Illirian sea, is a city built by the Greekes: <HI>Diomedes,</HI> after the ouerthrow of <HI>Troy,</HI> built the city <HI>Arpi, (Sarpi,</HI> or <HI>Monte S. Angelo</HI> a city in <HI>Apulia)</HI> being himselfe and his company caried thither by violence of storme and tempest. And <HI>Pisae in Liguria, (Pisa in Riuiera di Genoa)</HI> was first begun by the Grecians: as also in <HI>Tuscane</HI> the <HI>Tarquinij, (Tarquene)</HI> came from the Thessalians and Spinambrians: and the <HI>Perusini (Perugia)</HI> from the Achaians: what shall I say of the city <HI>Caere (Ceruetere?)</HI> what of the <HI>Latini?</HI> which do seeme to haue had their beginning from <HI>Aeneas:</HI> now the <HI>Falisci, Nolani, Abelani,</HI> are they not generally held for to be no other but colonies deriued from the <HI>Chalci∣denses</HI> of <HI>Asia</HI> the Lesse? what shall I speake of the whole shire of <HI>Campania?</HI> of the <HI>Brutij</HI> and <HI>Sabini?</HI> of the <HI>Samnites</HI> and <HI>Ta∣rentini?</HI> haue we not heard oft that they came from <HI>Lacedaemonia,</HI> and were commonly called <HI>Spurij?</HI> They report that <HI>Philo∣ctetes</HI> built the city of the <HI>Thurini, (Terra noua)</HI> where to this day his tombe is to be seene: as also the arrowes of <HI>Hercules,</HI> which were the bane of <HI>Troy.</HI> The <HI>Metapontini, (Torre di mare)</HI> also do still reserue, in the temple of <HI>Minerua,</HI> the tooles wherewith <HI>Epeus</HI> (from whom they are descended) made the Troiane horse, whereby the city was betraied. Whereupon all that part of <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> was called GREAT GREECE. Thus farre <HI>Iustine</HI> out of <HI>Trogus Pompeius.</HI> Whereby we gather, that the pleasant poet <HI>Ouid</HI> in the fourth booke of his <HI>Fastorum,</HI> did speake but the truth, when he said: <HI>Itala nam tellus Graecia Maior erat:</HI> For <HI>Grecia</HI> Great, that land was called, which now <HI>Italia</HI> hight: and so foorth, as followeth in the same place. The same almost that you haue heard out of <HI>Trogus.</HI> Of this same Great <HI>Greece</HI> I cannot but adde that which I haue obserued contrary to the opinion which some ve∣ry learned men in our time, haue written of it: namely, that euen as <HI>Sicilia,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his sixth booke testifieth, was compre∣hended vnder the name of <HI>Great Greece;</HI> so contrariwise also this <HI>Great Greece,</HI> was now and then vnderstood by the name of <HI>Si∣cilia:</HI> for proofe heereof consider these authorities: Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> saith, that <HI>Rhegium Iulium Brutiorum, (Reggio</HI> in <HI>Calabria</HI> the Lower) is a city of <HI>Sicilia: Aelianus</HI> and <HI>Suidas</HI> affirme the same of <HI>Tarentum</HI> in <HI>Calabria:</HI> the sixth Counsell of <HI>Constantino ple,</HI> held in the time of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, doth the like of <HI>Baiae</HI> in <HI>Campania: Stephanus</HI> describeth <HI>Sinuessa,</HI> a towne of <HI>Campania; Caulonia, (Castro veto)</HI> of the <HI>Locri, Lagaria,</HI> of the <HI>Thurini;</HI> and <HI>Mataurus,</HI> of the <HI>Brutij;</HI> by the name of places of <HI>Sicilia:</HI> the like doth <HI>Eustathius,</HI> by <HI>Crathis (Gratti)</HI> a riuer in <HI>Calabria:</HI> the Scholiast of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> by <HI>Neaethus,</HI> a riuer of the <HI>Crotoniatae,</HI> a people of <HI>Vmbria. Item, Liuy</HI> an Italian borne, a man of singular iudgement, and more ancient than those, hath <HI>Siculas vrbes in Campania,</HI> cities of <HI>Sicilia</HI> in <HI>Campania.</HI> Yea <HI>Pliny</HI> hath left recorded, that <HI>Togata Gallia,</HI> the furthest prouince of <HI>Italy</HI> toward the VVest, before such time as the Gauls came thither, was possessed of the <HI>Siculi. Thucydides</HI> writeth, that the <HI>Siculi</HI> being expelled by the <HI>Opici,</HI> a people of <HI>Campania,</HI> seized vpon this iland. And if we will not giue credit vnto <HI>Seruius,</HI> yet against <HI>Halicarnassaeus</HI> a writer of good credit, we cannot except, who hath written the very selfe same thing: namely, that the <HI>Siculi,</HI> a people borne and bred in <HI>Italy,</HI> and did first of all nations whatsoeuer inhabite and possesse the Romane soile. Lastly, that this prouince, called <HI>Great Greece,</HI> was inhabited of the <HI>Siculi, Strabo</HI> in the fith booke of his Geography doth testifie out of <HI>Antiochus.</HI> Thus farre of that ancient <HI>Great Greece,</HI> or, if you please so to call it, of <HI>Sicilia:</HI> all which we haue not described in this Mappe, but only the outter part of it; in which, beside <HI>Calabria, Apulia,</HI> the <HI>Brutij</HI> and <HI>Locri:</HI> there is <HI>Great Greece,</HI> properly so called by <HI>Ptolemey, Liuy, Polybius, Athenaeus</HI> and <HI>Valerius Maximus:</HI> and that, as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his sixth booke, and <HI>Cicero</HI> in his 2 booke of his Oratour, thinke because <HI>Pythagoras the Grecian Philosopher</HI> dwelt sometime in these quarters; or, as <HI>Synesius</HI> in his oration <HI>de Dono</HI> wri∣teth, for that it alwaies maintained and brought foorth <HI>schollerlike and militarie men.</HI> Yet I rather relie vpon the iudgement of <HI>Atheneus,</HI> who writeth that it was so called of the <HI>infinite number of Grecians</HI> which vsually dwelt in this prouince. And that <HI>Festus</HI> and <HI>Trogus</HI> are of this opinion, I haue partly shewed before. These forenamed countries of <HI>Halicarnassaeus,</HI> are compre∣hended vnder the name of EAST ITALY. <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth them, <HI>The front of Italy:</HI> which, as <HI>Mela</HI> saith, is diuided into <HI>two hornes,</HI> called in the fragments of <HI>Salust, two promontories,</HI> nesses, capes, or forelands, namely, <HI>Brutium, (Capo di Sparto vento,</HI> or, <HI>Capo de Larme)</HI> and <HI>Salentinum</HI> (now of some called <HI>Capo de S. Maria:</HI> of others, <HI>S. Maria de fin terre:</HI> and <HI>Capo de Leuca; item Stalat.</HI>) In the second booke of <HI>Straboes Epitome,</HI> they are termed <HI>coryphae,</HI> toppes: and are named <HI>Leucopetra,</HI> and <HI>Iapygium:</HI> (for these are synonymes with <HI>Bruttium</HI> and <HI>Salentinum.</HI>) But <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> calleth them <HI>Hornes:</HI> this <HI>The left horne,</HI> that, <HI>The right.</HI> For <HI>Salentinum,</HI> we read <HI>Lacinium,</HI> in <HI>Pliny:</HI> but whether it be a fault of the writers, or an errour of the authour, let the learned iudge, I determine nothing. The same <HI>Pliny</HI> compareth this tract to the forme of the <HI>Amazonian shield,</HI> that is, to the <HI>halfe moone,</HI> as <HI>Seruius</HI> expoundeth it, at that verse of the first booke of <HI>Virgils</HI> Aeneides, <HI>Ducit, Amazonidum lunatis agmina peltis.</HI> There is in these quarters, the <HI>wood Sila (La Sila)</HI> of which <HI>Salust, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Vibius</HI> haue made mention. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that it is seuen hun∣dred furlongs in length: full of goodly tall trees and well stored with good water. <HI>Cassiodorus</HI> in the twelfth booke of his <HI>Varia∣rum,</HI> vnto <HI>Anastasius,</HI> doth highly commend the <HI>cheese</HI> made heere about. From hence commeth Calabrian pitch <HI>(pix Brut∣tia)</HI> which <HI>Dioscorides</HI> in the ninety and eight chapter of his first booke <HI>De medica materia,</HI> speaketh of: and which <HI>Pliny,</HI> in the seuenth

Whether euery one of these were knowen to the ancients by seuerall names or not, I know not. <HI>Festus, Stephanus</HI> and others, call properly one of these <HI>Insula Diomedea,</HI> Diomedes ile, like as amongst the <HI>Bri∣tannicae insulae,</HI> the Brittish iles, one is properly named <HI>Britannia,</HI> Brittaine. One of them <HI>Tacitus</HI> calleth TRIMERVS: (or peraduenture <HI>Trimetus;</HI> for otherwise I doe not see from whence that name of <HI>Trimi∣te:</HI> whereby the greatest of them at this day is called, and of it the rest, should come.) <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth ano∣ther of them TEVTRIA: the other for ought I know, the ancients left vnnamed: as for <HI>Electris</HI> and <HI>Febra,</HI> which <HI>Seruius</HI> mentioneth at the eleuenth booke of <HI>Virgils</HI> Aeneids or <HI>Sebria,</HI> and <HI>Aletrides,</HI> whereof <HI>Pomponius Sabinus,</HI> vpon the same place, speaketh, I do very willingly confesse, that I haue not found them spoken of, by any ancient writer. They are seated in the Adriaticke sea, not farre from the sea-coast of <HI>Puglia,</HI> opposite to <HI>Monte de S. Angelo, Mons Garganus,</HI> or <HI>Promontorium Garganum.</HI> Not within kenning or sight of <HI>Taranto (Tarentum)</HI> a city of <HI>Apulia,</HI> as very falsly, at the same place, <HI>Seruius</HI> hath set downe. The name was deriued by the testimony of all writers both Latines and Greekes, from <HI>Diomedes</HI> the king of <HI>Aetolia, (Artinia, Nicetas</HI> calleth it) whom they report, after the surprising of <HI>Troy,</HI> in his returne homeward, not being enterteined of his owne nation, to be driuen hither and to be interred heere, and that his temple, monument or tombe did re∣maine in the greatest of them properly called <HI>Diomedea (S. Maria di Trimite)</HI> and that the Plane tree was first brought hither for to shaddow <HI>Diomedes</HI> tombe, <HI>Pliny</HI> in the first chapter of his twelfth booke of the history of Nature, hath left recorded. Into <HI>Trimerus,</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> writeth, <HI>Augustus</HI> banished sent his neece <HI>Iulia,</HI> conuict of adulterie: where he furthermore ad∣deth, that she endured that punishment of exile the space of twenty yeares. In <HI>Platina,</HI> in the life of <HI>Hadrian</HI> the first, I read, that <HI>Paullus Diaconus</HI> was once condemned thither, by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great. Of <HI>Diomedes</HI> birds (which <HI>Iuba</HI> calleth <HI>Catarractae:</HI> Aristotle, <HI>Charadrij:</HI> of others, <HI>Erodij,</HI> a kind of Cormorant or rauenous sea foule) proper to these ilands (for they are onely to be seene in this one place of all the world, if we may beleeue old writers) read <HI>Ouid</HI> in the thirteenth booke of his Metamor∣phosis, where he thus speaketh of them: <HI>Si volucrum quae sit dubiarum forma requiris, Vt non cignorum, sic albis proxima cignis.</HI> The doubtfull formes of birds most strange, if that you seeke to know: They be no swannes, yet white they be, as white as a∣ny snow. <HI>Suidas</HI> maketh them to be like to storkes. <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his Wonders, calleth them vaste and huge birdes with very long, and bigge bils. <HI>Pliny</HI> with <HI>Solinus</HI> do write that they be like the <HI>Fulica,</HI> a kinde of coote: of colour white, hauing teeth and eies of a fiery sparke. Some there are which do thinke them to be <HI>Heronshawes. Robert Constantine</HI> testifieth that the coun∣try people of these ilands do now call them <HI>Artenae:</HI> and that they make a noise like the crying of yong children. <HI>Item,</HI> that the fatte or grease of them is a soueraigne remedie against diseases arising of cold causes. <HI>Blondus</HI> writeth that he vnderstood by some of the inhabitants of these iles, that these fowles, still retaining the name of the <HI>Diomedean</HI> birdes, are of the bignesse of a goose. But to be very harmelesse creatures, yet neither doing them, nor the Church any maner of pleasure. They which desire to know more of these birdes, as also of the Metamorphosis and transmutation of <HI>Diomedes</HI> consorts into these fowles, or of their nature and quality, as of their kindnesse toward Grecians (<HI>honest-men, Strabo</HI> calleth them) and their curstnesse to strangers, (<HI>wicked-men,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> hath) and of the purifying of the temple, and of other poeticall fables deuised of them, let them haue recourse to the authours aboue named: to which they may ad that list, that which <HI>Aelianus</HI> hath written in the first c. of his 1. booke S. <HI>Aug.</HI> in the 16 c. of his 18 book <HI>De ciuitate Dei; Antigonius, Antony Liberalis, Lycophron,</HI> and his Scholiast <HI>Isacius.</HI> At this day these ilands are vnder the command of the kingdome of <HI>Naples:</HI> &amp; are al generally called by one name <HI>Tre∣mitanae,</HI> ilands <HI>de Trimite:</HI> &amp; euery one by a seueral &amp; proper name by it selfe, as thou maist read in our Geographical treasury. They are now all desert &amp; void of inhabitants, only that except in which sometime was the temple of <HI>Diomedes:</HI> where now is the Monasterie vulgarly called <HI>Santa Maria de Trimiti:</HI> possessed by regular canons, which <HI>Eugenius</HI> the fourth, Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> enlarged and endowed with great reuenews, as <HI>Blondus</HI> recordeth. These, as <HI>Zacharte Lillie</HI> reporteth, go to Church so dili∣gently, heare diuine seruice so deuoutly, and relieue those which by storme and tempest are driuen thither so charitably, that they are not onely very famous and reuerently esteemed of those that dwell round about them, but also of all seamen which trauell by that way. <HI>Leander Albertus</HI> saith that these ilands do breed most excellent horses.</P>

<HEAD>SICILIA, OR TRINACRIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat this was sometime a <HI>peninsula,</HI> or demy-ile, adioined to <HI>Italy,</HI> as a part of <HI>Brutium</HI> in <HI>Calabria</HI> neere to <HI>Rhegium (Rhezzo)</HI> and afterward was by violence of tempest seuered from the same (and of that accident the city <HI>Rhegium</HI> tooke the name) it is a generall opinion of all antiquity. But when, or at what certaine time, this diuision happened, there is not any memoriall, for ought I know, remaining in any ancient writer. <HI>Strabo, Pliny</HI> and <HI>Dionysius</HI> do write that it was caused by an earthquake: <HI>Silius</HI> and <HI>Cassiodorus,</HI> do thinke it to haue been done by the rage and violence of the tide and surges of the sea. They which lend their listening eares to fables, do attribute the cause of it to <HI>Neptune</HI> (as <HI>Eustathi∣us</HI> witnesseth) who, with his three-tined mace, in fauour of <HI>Iocastus,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> diuided it from the maine land, and so made it an iland, which before was but a demy-ile; that by that meanes he might the more safely inhabite and possesse the same. <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> moued by the authority of <HI>Hesiodus,</HI> ascribeth to <HI>Orion:</HI> who, that he might be compared to <HI>Hercules,</HI> cutting through the rockes and mountaines, first ope∣ned the Sicilian streights, as he did of <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> Therefore <HI>Trinacria quondam Italae pars vna fuit; sed pontus &amp; aestus Mutaue∣re situm, rupit confinia Nereus Victor: &amp; abscissos interluit aequore montes, &amp;c.</HI> They which esteeme the ilands of the midland sea, according to their quantity and content, do make this the greatest, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> who affirme this not only to excell the rest for bignesse, but also for goodnesse of soile. As concerning the forme of this iland, <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> saith it is like that Ca∣pitall letter of the Greekes, which they call <HI>Delta.</HI> That the whole iland was consecrated to <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Libera,</HI> that is, <HI>Proserpina,</HI> all old writers do generally with one consent affirme: to <HI>Ceres</HI> it was dedicated, because it first taught the rules of setting &amp; sowing of corne: to <HI>Proserpina,</HI> not so much for that she was from hence violently taken by <HI>Pluto,</HI> as for that (which <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Diodo∣rus</HI> do report for truth) <HI>Pluto,</HI> as soone as she vncouering her selfe first shewed herselfe to be seene of him, gaue it her for a boone; which kind of gifts and fauours the Greekes call <HI>anacalypteria.</HI></P>
<P>Of the fertility and riches of this country, there is a famous testimonie, written by the learned Oratour <HI>Cicero,</HI> in his second ora∣tion against <HI>Verres,</HI> where he saith that <HI>Marcus Cato</HI> did call it, <HI>The garner and storehouse of the Romane common wealth, and the nurce of the vulgar sort.</HI> The same <HI>Cicero</HI> doth adde in that place, that it was not only the storehouse of the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> but al∣so it was accounted for a well furnished treasurie: for without any cost or charge of ours saith he, it hath vsually clothed, maintai∣ned and furnished our greatest armies with leather, apparell and corne. <HI>Strabo</HI> in his 6. booke reporteth almost the same thing of it. Whatsoeuer <HI>Sicilia</HI> doth yeeld, saith <HI>Solinus,</HI> whether by the kindnesse and temperature of the aire, or by the industry and labour of man, it is accounted next vnto those things that are of best estimation: were it not that such things as the earth first putteth forth are ouergrowen with <HI>Centorui</HI> saffron <HI>(Crocus Ceturipinus). Aristotle</HI> in his <HI>Admiranda,</HI> writeth, that about <HI>Pelorus (Cabo de la torre del Faro)</HI> saffron groweth in such abundance, that any man that listeth may load and carie it away by whole cart loads. But <HI>Dioscorides</HI> doth affirme, that that which groweth about <HI>Centuripinum</HI> (a towne now called <HI>Centorui</HI>) is much weaker and of lesse force, than that which groweth in other places. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> saith, that in the fields neere <HI>Leontium, (Lintini)</HI> and in diuers other places of this iland, wheat doth grow of it selfe, without any labour or looking to of the husbandman. That this iland was made a prouince first before any other forren nation, amongst other <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> haue left recorded. <HI>Martianus</HI> shew∣eth that there were in it 6. colonies, and 60. cities. <HI>Pintianus,</HI> at the 8. c. of <HI>Plinies</HI> 3. booke, readeth 73. free colonies &amp; cities. <HI>Silius</HI> in his 14. booke, and <HI>Ouid</HI> in diuers places reckoneth vp the names of many of them: but this our mappe speaketh of many more.</P>
<P>That it was in the beginning possessed and inhabited by <HI>Giants, Laestrigones, Anthropophagi,</HI> and <HI>Cyclopes</HI> barbarous and vnci∣uill nations, all histories and fables do iointly with one consent auerre. Yet <HI>Thucydides</HI> saith that these sauage people dwelt only in one place of the iland. Afterward the <HI>Sicani,</HI> a nation of <HI>Spaine,</HI> so called of the riuer <HI>Sicanus,</HI> (or as <HI>Solinus</HI> and <HI>Berosus,</HI> haue giuen out, of their king <HI>Sicanus</HI>) driuen out of their country by the <HI>Ligures,</HI> possessed it. That these <HI>Sicani</HI> were not bred in the ile (although some do so thinke) <HI>Thucydides</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> do constantly auouch. Of these it was named SICANIA. The <HI>Elymi</HI> and some of the <HI>Pho∣censes,</HI> seated themselues heere: after them succeeded the <HI>Phryges</HI> driuen from <HI>Troy,</HI> as <HI>Pausanias</HI> thinketh: and the <HI>Morgetes</HI> expel∣led out of <HI>Italy</HI> by the <HI>Oenotri,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth. In <HI>Plutarch</HI> his <HI>Conuiual. Quaest.</HI> and <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> his 2. booke <HI>de Manibus,</HI> I read that the <HI>Dores</HI> sometime did inhabite it. Lastly, it was all conquered by the <HI>Siculi,</HI> a people of <HI>Italy</HI> ouerthrowen &amp; cast out of their possessions by the <HI>Opici,</HI> and of them it was called SICILIA; when as before it was knowen by the name of TRINACIA, as <HI>Dionysius</HI> wri∣teth: or TRINACRIS, as <HI>Ouid:</HI> or TRINACRIA and TRIQVETRA, as <HI>Pliny</HI> reporteth, of the triangular forme. Whereupon the Romans in their money were wont to counterfait or expresse this prouince by 3. legs ioined together about the vpper end of the thigh, (not much vnlike those armes of the E. of <HI>Darby,</HI> as I thinke,) <HI>Lycophron</HI> for the same reason giueth it the title or epithite of TRICERVIX, 3. necked: and <HI>Pindarus</HI> in like maner calleth it TRICVSPIS, 3. pointed. <HI>Homer</HI> the prince of poets nameth it CYCLOPVM TERRA, the land of the <HI>Cyclopes,</HI> being peraduenture in his time not knowen by any proper name. <HI>Iulius Firmicus,</HI> saith that the <HI>Siculi,</HI> the people of this iland, are acute and nimble witted: <HI>Quint.</HI> in his 6. booke of his <HI>Orat.</HI> saith that they are lasciuious and full of words.</P>
<P>Besides many famous acts done by these people both at home and abroad, aswell in peace as in war there be many other things which haue made this iland very renowmed: the birth of <HI>Ceres,</HI> the rauishing of <HI>Proserpina,</HI> the Giant <HI>Enceladus,</HI> the wonderfull mathematician <HI>Archimedes,</HI> the famous geometrician <HI>Euclide,</HI> the painfull historian <HI>Diodorus, Empedocles</HI> the deep philosopher, the ingenious architecture of <HI>Daedalus,</HI> the tombe of <HI>Sibylla Cumana, Syracusae</HI> the famous <HI>tetrapolis,</HI> or as <HI>Strabo</HI> saith, a <HI>pentapolis</HI> (one city made of 4. or 5. cities: like as <HI>London,</HI> in respect of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and <HI>Southwarke,</HI> may be said to be a <HI>tripolis</HI>) the foun∣taine <HI>Arethusa,</HI> the lake <HI>Palicus,</HI> the mount <HI>AEtna, Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charibdis,</HI> and the notorious harlot <HI>Lais.</HI> Beside many miracles and wonderfull workes of nature, which thou maist read of in <HI>Solinus, Trogus</HI> in his fourth booke, <HI>Antigonus de Mirab. l.</HI> and <HI>A∣chilles Statius</HI> in his 2. booke of <HI>Loue: Item</HI> statues costly images, for art and curious workemanship of great estimation; which are described by <HI>Cicero</HI> in his orations against <HI>Verres. Athenaeus</HI> commended highly the cheese, doues and diuers sorts of garments of <HI>Sicilia. Antigonus</HI> writeth that the <HI>Cactos</HI> (a kind of thorne) doth grow in this ile, and not in any other place of the world be∣side: as <HI>Theophrastus</HI> affirmeth: vpon which if a stagge shall tread and pricke his foote, his bones will yeeld no sound, and there∣fore they wilbe naught to make pipes of. Heere also, as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, is found the <HI>Smaragde,</HI> a kind of pretious stone, of great esti∣mation in those daies: in the sea, the same authour affirmeth, that Corall is gotten by such as do seeke for it. <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> doth write, that this iland had at first no hares, but such as were brought in by <HI>Anaxilas Rhegnius</HI> The Sicilian sea, which beateth vpon this ile on the East side, was also called <HI>Ausonium mare,</HI> and was the deepest of all the Mediterran sea, as <HI>Strabo</HI> testifieth. There is another iland in this sea neere to <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> called <HI>Sicilia,</HI> as <HI>Stephanus</HI> reporteth. The ile <HI>Naxus (Nicsia,</HI> it is now called in the <HI>AEgean</HI> or <HI>Archipelago, Pliny</HI> saith, was sometime named <HI>Sicilia minor, Sicilia,</HI> the lesse. <HI>Pausanias</HI> also speaketh of <HI>Sicilia</HI> a little hill not farre from <HI>Athens</HI> in <HI>Greece.</HI> Moreouer there is a place in the Palace of <HI>Rome,</HI> of that name, as <HI>Capitolinus</HI> hath left recorded in the life of <HI>Perlinax</HI> the Emperour. But these are by-matters nor so directly to our purpose.</P>
<P>Diuers adagies, prouerbs, or by-words haue sprong from hence: as <HI>Siculissare,</HI> spoken of one that is sullen or tetchie: <HI>Siculum mare,</HI> the Sicilian sea, meaning that which is dangerous: <HI>Siculus miles,</HI> A Sicilian souldier, that is, a mercenary or stipendary: <HI>Si∣culae gerrae,</HI> and <HI>Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim,</HI> He falleth vpon the rockes that laboureth to shunne the quicke sands; spoken of him that coueting to escape one danger falleth into a worse. But of these and such like thou maist read <HI>Erasmus</HI> his <HI>Chiliades.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DACIA, and MOESIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He inhabitants of DACIA, the Greekes called DACI: the Latines GETAE; as <HI>Pliny, Dion, Ste∣phanus</HI> and others do testifie: (This also <HI>Cottiso,</HI> sometime the King of that nation, doth confirme: whom <HI>Suetonius</HI> nameth, <HI>The king of the Getes;</HI> Horace calleth him, <HI>Dacum:</HI> a Dake) <HI>Item, Ior∣nandes</HI> saith, that the Romanes indifferently called them DACI, or GOTHI. I do obserue that <HI>Herodotus</HI> and the writers about that age haue generally comprehended them vnder the name of the SCYTHAE, <HI>Scythians:</HI> to whom also the foresaid <HI>Iornandes</HI> doth wholly assent and agree, <HI>Item,</HI> the abouenamed <HI>Stephanus</HI> nameth them DAOS and <HI>Strabo</HI> DAVOS, <HI>Daces,</HI> or <HI>Dawes,</HI> who notwithstanding maketh this distinction betweene them: that the <HI>Getae</HI> were those which were seated farther Eastward; the <HI>Daci,</HI> those which dwelt more into the West: Notwithstanding they speake one and the same language: namely, the Duche tongue, vsed also by the <HI>Thracians,</HI> as may be demonstrated out of <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Iornandes.</HI> Moreouer <HI>Arrianus</HI> writeth, that the <HI>Getae</HI> were also called APATHONI∣ZONTES: but it is to be amended: and out of <HI>Herodotus</HI> first booke, to be written ATHANATIZONTES, as who say, <HI>Immor∣tall:</HI> for they do verily beleeue, that they shal neuer die: but after their departure out of this life, go presently vnto one <HI>Zamolxis,</HI> a Saint or Idol which they especially worship and adore. But of this their Saint and ceremonie you may read more in the said authour. <HI>Suidas</HI> sheweth that in his time these people were knowen by the name of the PATZINACITAE. That those Dakes did inhabite on either side of the riuer <HI>Donaw (Danubius)</HI> euen vp as high as mount <HI>Haemus,</HI> I do find recorded by <HI>Dion:</HI> whom I do perceiue, vnder that name, to conteine also the <HI>Moesi.</HI> And indeed we shall heereafter proue that the same Dakes were often translated afterward into these Moesiaes. Therefore Saint <HI>Paullinus,</HI> for that reason, maketh this same DACIA twofold, in his treatise Of the returne of <HI>Nicetas,</HI> in this verse; <HI>Et Getae currunt, &amp; vterque Dacus:</HI> The Getes in troupes doe throng, both Dakes they do the like. In the Digests of the ciuill law mention is made of two Daciaes. But of the Moesiaes we will speake heereafter, this place we haue assigned to the true DACIA, properly so called, whose bounds <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> the Prince of all Geographers, maketh to be the riuers <HI>Donaw (Danubius) Teissa (Tibiscus</HI> or <HI>Pathissus,</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> nameth it) <HI>Pruth (Hierasus)</HI> and the mount <HI>Carpates. Iornandes,</HI> this countrie man borne, saith, that the next neighbours to this <HI>Dacia,</HI> vpon the East, are the <HI>Roxolani;</HI> vpon the West, the <HI>Tamazites: (Zyges</HI> I would rather read, moued so to thinke by likeliehood and probability of the thing it selfe: as also by the diuers reading of another copy, which hath <HI>Taziges,</HI> a word no where else found) vpon the North, it hath the <HI>Sarmatae</HI> and the <HI>Bastarnae:</HI> and on the South, the riuer <HI>Donaw (Danubius.)</HI> This <HI>Dacia,</HI> as the same authour saith, oueragainst <HI>Moesia,</HI> beyond the <HI>Donaw,</HI> is enclosed round with mountaines, and hath only two passages in and out; one by <HI>Bontas (Rotteothurn)</HI> and <HI>Tabae (Bross.) Xiphiline,</HI> I thinke, calleth this later <HI>Taphae. Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> to this addeth <HI>Succorum angustias,</HI> the streights of <HI>Turkzuest,</HI> by the towne <HI>Succi. Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Marcellinus, Comes,</HI> the booke of Remembrances, and the Miscellan story, do diuide this country into two prouinces, MEDI∣TERRANEA and RIPENSIS: There are some (of which <HI>Lazius</HI> is one) that to those do adde a third called ALPESTRIS, vp∣on what ground and proofe, I know not. VANNIANVM REGNVM, of which <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> do speake, was, as seemeth heere abouts. This is properly that prouince of <HI>Dacia,</HI> which <HI>Eutropius</HI> saith did conteine in circuite a thousand miles. The chiefe city of this part was <HI>Zarmisogethusa,</HI> which afterward was called COLONIA VLPIA TRAIANA AVG. DACIC. ZARMIS. as we find in certaine inscriptions in Marble, and was so named of <HI>Vlpius Traianus</HI> the Emperour. For he first by conquering ouercomming their king <HI>Decebalus,</HI> made it a prouince. Of which warre, made by <HI>Traiane</HI> against the Dakes, (for the histories of it, written by himselfe, cited by <HI>Priscian</HI> the Grammarian, are lost) you may read in <HI>Dion</HI> in the life of this Emperour. Behold also and view the columne set vp by the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>Traianes</HI> market place, which yet to this day re∣maineth whole and sound. This columne, <HI>Hieronymus Mutianus</HI> the famous painter, shaddowed out with his owne hand and imprinted at <HI>Rome,</HI> in 130. tables. The same hath <HI>F. Alphonsus Ciacconus</HI> so liuely expressed and declared with such a learned and laborious Commentary, that in it a man would thinke that he had rather seen this battell fought, than to haue read or heard ought of the same, from the relation of others. <HI>Florus</HI> writeth, <HI>that this country doth lie amid the mountaines. Item,</HI> he calleth it, <HI>a copsy country, full of woods and forrests.</HI> For he affirmeth that <HI>Curio</HI> came vp as high as <HI>Dacia,</HI> but durst go no fur∣ther, for feare of the dreadfull darke woods. <HI>Strabo</HI> in the seuenth booke of his Geographie, and <HI>Virgil</HI> in the third of his Ge∣orgickes, do speake of the deserts and wildernesses of the Getes. The same authour calleth it, <HI>Gentem indomitam,</HI> an vnruelie nation. <HI>Statius</HI> saith, that they are <HI>hirsuti,</HI> hairie, <HI>intonsi,</HI> vnshorne, <HI>pelliti,</HI> furred or clad in skins, inhumane, sturdy, stern, <HI>braccati,</HI> wearing long side breeches and mantles, like to our Irishmen. I read in <HI>Pliny</HI> that they vsed <HI>to paint their faces</HI> [like vnto our Britans.] That there is not a more stern nation in the World, <HI>Ouid</HI> the Poet, who did not only see the country, but also dwelt amongst them and saw their manners, very truly wrote of them. <HI>Vegetius,</HI> who wrote of the Art of warre, saith that it is <HI>a very warlike people:</HI> Hauing indeed, as the Prince of Poets testifieth, god <HI>Mars for their Lieutenant and Gouernour.</HI> Of <HI>Claudian,</HI> it is named, <HI>Bellipotens,</HI> a mighty nation for warlike men. <HI>Philargyrius,</HI> out of <HI>Aufidius Modestus</HI> writeth, that when they go to warre, they will not set forward, before they drinking downe a certaine measure of the waters of the riuer <HI>Ister (Donaw)</HI> in the maner of hallowed wine, do sweare that they would neuer returne home againe into their owne country, vntill they had slaine their enemies. Whereupon <HI>Virgil</HI> called this riuer <HI>Istrum Coniuratum,</HI> coniured <HI>Donaw. Trogus</HI> wri∣teth, that this nation, with their king <HI>Orotes,</HI> (another copy hath <HI>Olores:</HI> in <HI>Dion</HI> I read, <HI>Roles</HI>) did fight against the Bastarnae, with very ill successe: in reuenge of which cowardise, they were by their king enioined, when they go to bed, to lie at the beds feet: or to do those seruices to their wiues, which they were wont to do for them. They were in times past so strong, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that they were able to make an army of 200000. men. Of them also peraduenture this speech of <HI>Silius Itali∣cus</HI> is to be vnderstood: <HI>At gente in Scythica suffixa cadauera truncis, Lenta dies sepelit putri liquentia tabo.</HI> Iosephus in his se∣cond booke against <HI>Appian</HI> writeth there are a certaine kind of Dakes commonly called <HI>Plisti,</HI> whose manner of life he com∣pareth to the course of life of the <HI>Essenes.</HI> These I do verily beleeue are the same with those which <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth <HI>Plistae</HI> and were of the stocke of the <HI>Abij.</HI> And thus much of <HI>Dacia,</HI> now the <HI>Moesi</HI> do follow, who, as <HI>Dion Prusaeus</HI> noteth out of <HI>Homer,</HI> were sometime named <HI>Mysi.</HI></P>
<P>By the name of MOESIA was all that country vulgarly called, which the riuer <HI>Saw (Sauus)</HI> falling into <HI>Donaw,</HI> aboue <HI>Dal∣matia, Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thracia,</HI> doth diuide from <HI>Pannonia.</HI> In the which <HI>Moesia,</HI> beside diuers other nations, there do inhabit those which anciently were named the <HI>Triballi,</HI> and those which now are called <HI>Dardani.</HI> These are the wordes of <HI>Dion Ni∣caeus.</HI> It is by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> enclosed and bounded with the same limits. <HI>Pliny</HI> also doth extend the coasts of it from the meeting of the riuer <HI>Saw</HI> with <HI>Donaw,</HI> euen vnto <HI>Pontus (Mar maiore)</HI> Eastward: and <HI>Iornandes</HI> maketh it to reach as farre as <HI>Histria,</HI> Westward. We haue said before, that MOESIA was sometime called DACIA: for proofe whereof I could alledge <HI>Flauius Vopiscus:</HI> who writeth that <HI>Aurelianus</HI> the Emperour, borne heere, did bring certaine people out of <HI>Dacia,</HI> and placed them in MOESIA and to haue named it DACIA AVRELIANA, after his owne name, which is now that prouince that diuideth

<PB REF="295"/> the two <HI>Moesiaes</HI> one from another. The same doth <HI>Suidas</HI> in the word DACIA, report. The prouince <HI>Dacia,</HI> saith <HI>Lutro∣pius</HI> (speaking of the same <HI>Aurelianus</HI>) he placed in <HI>Moesia</HI> where it now abideth on the South side of <HI>Donaw,</HI> when as before it was seated vpon the North side of the same. And <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> sheweth, that by the same Emperour, there were two <HI>Da∣ciaes</HI> made of the countries of <HI>Moesia</HI> and <HI>Dardania:</HI> whereupon in the Code of the ciuill law these wordes are read, <HI>Mediter∣ranca Mysia, seu Dardania:</HI> vpland Moesia, or Dardania: confounding the one with the other. Vnderneath the name of <HI>Da∣cia,</HI> beside those countries abouenamed, was conteined also PRAEVALITANA, and that part of <HI>Macedonia</HI> commonly called SALVTARIS, as the booke of Remembrances <HI>(liber Notitiarum)</HI> doth manifestly affirme. Of the people heere, brought from other places, <HI>Strabo</HI> likewise writeth, that in his time (who we know liued in the time of <HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI>) by <HI>AElius Catus</HI> (or rather, as the learned and industrious <HI>Causabon</HI> out of <HI>Dion</HI> would haue vs read, <HI>Licinius Crassus:</HI>) were conueighed of the Getes which dwelt eyond the <HI>Donaw (Ister)</HI> into <HI>Thracia,</HI> more than 50000. men, and were afterward called MYSI, <HI>Mysians.</HI> An inscription of an ancient stone, mentioned in <HI>Smetius</HI> saith, that <HI>AElius Plautius</HI> propraetor of <HI>Moesia,</HI> did transport into this country, of the people and nations beyond the <HI>Donaw,</HI> more than 10000. men, together with their wiues, children, nobles, princes and kings. This MYSIA, or, as for the most part the Latines write it MOESIA, <HI>Pto∣lemey</HI> diuideth into the VPPER and NEATHER <HI>(Superior &amp; Inferior)</HI> this in the Code of <HI>Iustinian</HI> is called SECVNDA, that PRIMA, (the <HI>Second,</HI> and <HI>First.</HI>) The neither is named of <HI>Iornandes</HI> MINOR SCYTHIA, the <HI>Lesser Scythia:</HI> of <HI>Zosimus,</HI> SCYTHIA THRACENSIS, <HI>Scythia of Thrace:</HI> of <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Marius,</HI> SCYTHICA PONTICA, <HI>Scythia of Pontus:</HI> and the in∣habitants of the same <HI>Celtoscythae:</HI> of <HI>Polyaenus,</HI> PONTICA MARITIMA, <HI>Pontus vpon the sea:</HI> of <HI>Ouid</HI> and others, PONTVS, simply without any addition: Some there are which do call it FLACCIA, of one <HI>Flaccus,</HI> a Romane, whom it is certaine out of <HI>Ouid,</HI> was sometime heereabouts lieutenant for the state of the Empire. Neither doth this seeme to be altogether false or vn∣probable; for the name <HI>Waiachia</HI> or <HI>Valachia,</HI> whereby it is knowē at this day doth import so much. By <HI>Ouid</HI> also in sundrie places it was described vnder these names, <HI>Sarmaticū solum, Geticū littus, Cymmeriū littus,</HI> and <HI>Barbaria:</HI> the Sarmatian soile, the Gottish or Cymmerian shore, and Barbaria. These countries are very fertile of all maner of fruites and commodities, so that, as <HI>Solinus</HI> witnesseth, the Romanes commonly called it <HI>Cereris horreum, Ceres</HI> barne. The poet, as <HI>Procopius</HI> in his 4. booke <HI>AEdifici.</HI> noteth, calleth these people <HI>Enchemachous,</HI> such as fight aloofe and farre off. <HI>Mysos in palustra feroces:</HI> and <HI>Quum Geticis ingens premeretur Mysia plaustris:</HI> when <HI>Mesia</HI> great was much oppressed with Gottish waines: thus <HI>Claudian,</HI> the poet writeth of them. <HI>Dant illis animos arcus, plena{que} pharetrae:</HI> They much presume vpon their bow, and cunning great in archery: as <HI>Ouid</HI> in his first booke <HI>de Ponto,</HI> writeth of them. <HI>Aelianus</HI> sheweth that they were able by their owne strength and power to keepe out the Scythians from entring their country, and euery way to defend the same from that furious and vi∣olent enemy. <HI>Strabo</HI> saith, that they were exceedingly giuen to robbe and steale. <HI>Vix hâc inuenies totum, mihi crede, per or∣bem, Quae minus angusta pace fruatur humus:</HI> Scarse maist thou find in all the world, so small a plot of ground: Where bloudy wars their hideous noise, more oftentimes do sound; as the forenamed poet writeth of this country: as also this that follow∣eth in another place: <HI>In quibus est nemo qui non coryton &amp; arcum, Tela{que} vipereo lurida felle gerat.</HI> Amongst these men ther's none, but hath his sturdie bow, With poisoned arrowes sharpe and swift, to fight against his foe. How faire and stout they were, thou maist see by this of <HI>Florus.</HI> One of the Captaines, saith he, stepped out before the army, and entreating their si∣lence, demandeth, who are you? It was iointly with one voice answered of all, We are Romanes, lords of all nations of the world. To which answeare they replied againe, So you are indeed, if you can conquer vs. <HI>Posidonius</HI> in <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth, that they forbeare the eating of flesh for religion and conscience sake: and do feed only vpon butter and cheese. Of the fabu∣lous story of a kind of horses heere, if thou desire to know, see <HI>Elianus:</HI> as also <HI>Solinus</HI> of the strange hearb growing in that part of the country called <HI>Pontica.</HI> In <HI>Moesia</HI> also is the prouince called DARDANIA, which we said was called MYSIA MEDI∣TERRANEA, <HI>Vpland Moesia,</HI> for that it is farre remote and distant from the riuer <HI>Donaw.</HI> Of the inhabitants and people of this country, the same authour thus speaketh: In all their life, as I heare by report from others, these people do onely bath or wash themselues three times; once, as soone as they are borne: another time when they marry: and againe at their death. Of the <HI>Triballi,</HI> a people of this country take this of <HI>Pliny</HI> as he alleadgeth it out of <HI>Isigonus.</HI> They do bewitch and kill with their eies such as they do stedfastly looke vpon, any long time together; especially if they be angrie: which mischiefe of theirs, strip∣lings are most subiect vnto, and soonest hurt by. But that is most notable and worth the obseruation, that in ech eie they haue two sights apeece. He that desireth to read more of this country, especially of the Lower <HI>Moesia,</HI> let him repaire to <HI>Ouids</HI> 3. booke <HI>de Ponto,</HI> at the 1. 4. and 10. Elegies. Of their barbarous manners, rites, customes and ceremonies, thou shalt find much in the 7. Elegie of his 5. booke <HI>de Tristibus:</HI> of the riuer <HI>Donaw</HI> or <HI>Ister</HI> (which <HI>Elianus</HI> in the 23. chapter of his 14. booke <HI>de Animalibus</HI> calleth, <HI>The king of Riuers.</HI> Of <HI>Apollonius,</HI> in the fourth booke of his <HI>Argonautickes,</HI> it is named <HI>Cor∣nu oceani,</HI> the horne of the sea) for that it runneth through the middest of those countries which heere we haue described, it is not amisse, in my iudgement to say something of that also. That <HI>Ister</HI> or <HI>Donaw,</HI> of all the riuers of the Romane Empire, for greatnesse is next vnto <HI>Nilus,</HI> we do read in the fragments of <HI>Salust. Gyraldus</HI> in his <HI>Syntagmata Deorum,</HI> affirmeth, that the kings of <HI>Babylon</HI> were wont to reserue certaine of the water of <HI>Donaw</HI> or <HI>Ister,</HI> in ther treasuries amongst their pretious iewels. <HI>Caesarius, Nazianzenus</HI> brother, in his dialogues saith, that this is one of the riuers of Paradise: and to be that which the holy Scripture calleth <HI>Phison:</HI> which I will easily grant him to be true, when he shall perswade me, that by Paradise is meant the whole world or massie globe of this lower element of the earth: which I do verily beleeue he thought to be true. <HI>Seneca,</HI> in the sixth booke of his naturall Philosophy, saith, that this <HI>Donaw</HI> doth part <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> Notwithstanding all writers generally both Latines and Greekes, aswell ancient as those of later times do attribute this to the riuer <HI>Done (Tanais.)</HI> And what is he, I pray you, that euer dreamed that <HI>Germany</HI> which is beyond this riuer should be a country of <HI>Asia?</HI> Shall we correct the copy? Or shall we retaine that reading in <HI>Horace,</HI> vpon the credit and perill of <HI>Acron</HI> his expositour? where he saith, that <HI>Tanais</HI> is also called <HI>Danubius.</HI> I leaue it to the censure of the learned. (This we know for a certainty aswell <HI>Tanais</HI> as <HI>Danubius,</HI> is of the inhabitants neere about, called <HI>Done:</HI> and surely I thinke that both the Greeke <HI>Tanais,</HI> as the Latine <HI>Danubius,</HI> were made of the barbarous <HI>Done</HI> or <HI>Tane;</HI> which in that language peraduenture for ought I know, may signifie a riuer or streame: so <HI>Nilas,</HI> as <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> seemeth to affirme tooke his name of <HI>Nuchul,</HI> which generally signifieth a ri∣uer, as all men meanly skild in Hebrew or Arabicke can testifie with him.) <HI>Isidore</HI> also in the ninth chapter of the seuenteenth booke of his <HI>Origines,</HI> seemeth to be of this opinion, where he writeth that <HI>Rhabarbarum,</HI> rhew barbe, groweth in <HI>solo barba∣rico,</HI> in a barbarous country, beyond the <HI>Donaw:</HI> For we know at this day, that it groweth neere the riuer <HI>Rha,</HI> which is be∣yond the <HI>Donaw</HI> Eastward. In <HI>Pliny</HI> we read that euery one of his mouthes, whereby it emptieth it selfe into the sea, are so wide and great, that it is affirmed to ouercome the sea for forty miles in length together, and that so farre the waters may be perceiued to be sweet amid the brackish surges of the salt sea. <HI>Polybius</HI> in his fourth booke to these adioineth, that by the vio∣lent and swift fall of the waters of this riuer into <HI>Pontus (Mar maiore)</HI> there are certaine knols, hils, or shelfs, which the sea∣men call <HI>Stethe,</HI> that is, breast bones, made of the gathering together of such things as the riuer bringeth downe with it, and are more than a day saile off from land, vpon which oft times the seamen falling by negligence, are in great danger of ship∣wracke. <HI>Strabo</HI> also maketh mention of the same. They which desire to know more of this riuer, his name, nature, quality, fountaine, mouthes, and streames which do runne into it, let him read the commentaries of <HI>William Stuckius</HI> written vpon <HI>Arrianus Periplus</HI> of the Euxine sea: for there he hath most plentifully and learnedly descr bed all these things. Of the Thra∣cians, Moesians, Getes, Dakes and other countries, nations and people of this mappe, read the seuenth booke of <HI>Straboes</HI> Geography, and the Epitome of the same.</P>

<HEAD>PONTVS EVXINVS, now called MAR MAIORE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He sea which heere we purpose to describe (famoused of ancient writers by meanes of the <HI>Argonantes</HI> and fabulous story of <HI>the golden fleece</HI>) was called, as we find recorded, by diuers and sundrie names: first it was called PONTVS by the figure <HI>Synecdoche;</HI> then PONTVS AXENVS, that is, <HI>inhospitale,</HI> the harbourlesse sea, but afterward it was named PONTVS EVXINVS, <HI>hospitale mare,</HI> the good harborough, as <HI>Pliny, Ouid</HI> and others do witnesse. <HI>Strabo, Tacitus, Plutarch, Ptole∣mey</HI> and <HI>Iornandes</HI> do call it PONTICVM <HI>mare,</HI> the Ponticke sea, without any addition at all. <HI>Lucretius</HI> nameth it PONTI <HI>mare,</HI> the sea of <HI>Pontus,</HI> of the country <HI>Pontus</HI> abuttant vpon it. For the same reason it is, of <HI>Valerius Flaccus, Ouid</HI> and <HI>Mar∣tianus,</HI> named SARMATICVM and SCYTHICVM <HI>mare,</HI> the Sarmatian and Scythian sea; of <HI>Claudian</HI> AMAZONI∣VM: of <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Orosius,</HI> CIMMERIVM: of <HI>Festus Auienus,</HI> TAVRICVM: of the <HI>Sarmatians, Scythians, Amazones, Cimmerians</HI> and <HI>Tauri,</HI> certaine Nations dwelling vpon the coast of this sea. Of the prouince <HI>Colchis,</HI> neighbour vnto it vpon the East, <HI>Strabo</HI> nameth it COLCHICVM <HI>mare,</HI> of the mountaine <HI>Caucasus,</HI> which heere beginneth: <HI>Apollonius</HI> intituleth it CAVCASEVM: of the riuer <HI>Phasis,</HI> which vnloadeth it selfe into this sea, (or towne of that name situate vpon that riuer) <HI>Aristides</HI> calleth it PHASIANVM <HI>mare. Procopius</HI> saith that it was sometime named <HI>Tanais,</HI> vnfitly and falsly, as I thinke. Almost all ancient writers haue likened this sea (or more truly, this bay or gulfe) vnto a Scythian bow when it is bent: so that the string doth represent the South part of it: namely from the streights of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> vnto the further end of it Eastward, toward the riuer <HI>Phasis:</HI> for excepting only the promontory <HI>Carambis, (Cabo Pisello)</HI> all the rest of this shore hath such small capes and creekes, that it is not much vnlike to a right line. The other side or North part doth re∣semble an horne that hath two crooked ends, the vpper end more round: the lower more straight: which proportion this our mappe doth very precisely expresse. This sea also hath two promontories; one in the South, then called <HI>Promontorium Carambis,</HI> now <HI>Cabo Pisello:</HI> the other in the North, <HI>Ptole∣mey</HI> nameth it <HI>Criou metopon, Arietis frons,</HI> the rammes head: <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> calleth it <HI>Acroma,</HI> and now it is knowen by the name <HI>Famar.</HI> These two capes are opposite one against the other, and are distant one from another about 2500. furlongs, as <HI>Ammianus</HI> and <HI>Eustathius</HI> do testifie: which although they do make 312. Italian miles, yet they are distant only 170. miles, as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith: or as <HI>Strabo</HI> reporteth, so much as a ship will saile in three daies: not∣withstanding to those, which do saile either from the East to West, or from West to East, they seeme to be so neere one to the other, that one would thinke that there were the end of the sea, and that <HI>Pontus Euxinus</HI> were two seas: but when you shall come in the middest between these two capes, then the other part appeareth, as it were a second or another sea. The compasse of it round about by the shore <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh to be 25000. furlongs: <HI>Polybius</HI> but 22000. and yet from this <HI>Ammianus</HI> taketh 2000. and that by the authority of <HI>Eratosthenes, Hecataeus</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> as there he affirmeth. <HI>Herodotus</HI> an eie-witnesse of the same, writeth that he measured the length of it and found it to be 11100. furlongs: and likewise he found the breadth of it (where it was furthest ouer) to be 320. furlongs. This measure <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> in the twelfth chapter of his fourth booke, do more distinctly, partly out of their owne and partly out of other mens opinions, set downe. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that about 40. riuers do vnloade themselues into it. Yet this our mappe doth shew many more. Antiquity doth hold that this sea, of all our seas, was by farre the greatest; (heere hence I suppose that the Italians haue giuen it that name of <HI>Mar maiore,</HI> the Great sea) and that heere (as there at <HI>Caliz,</HI> without the straits of <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) was the end of the World: and that it was innaui∣gable, both for the huge greatnesse of it, as also by reason of the barbarous nations which daily did annoy the shore, and vse all maner of cruelty and in∣humanity toward strangers and aliens. From hence arose those epithites and adiuncts giuen by the ancient poets to this sea of <HI>Pontus; vast and rough, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Catullus</HI> call it: <HI>Ouid, infinite</HI> and <HI>terrible: Lucane, a deuouring</HI> and <HI>dangerous sea; Silius, raging: Statius, an vncertaine</HI> and <HI>swelling sea: Valerius Flaccus, perilous: Manilius, horrible, spitefull</HI> and <HI>furious: Seneca, mad</HI> and <HI>churlish: Festus Auienus, raucisonum,</HI> making a hoarse ill fauoured noise. Thus farre of the Names, Forme and bignesse of this sea: of the Situation and Nature of the same, although <HI>Herodotus, Pomponius, Strabo, Pliny, Ouid</HI> and <HI>Macrobius</HI> (that I may say nothing of others) haue spoken much, yet in mine opinion, no man hath done it more exactly and diligently than <HI>Ammianus</HI> in his 22. booke; whom he that listeth, may adioine to this our discourse: and if he be not satisfied with these, he may to them adde a whole booke, writ∣ten by <HI>Arrianus</HI> of this sea: together with the large commentaries, of <HI>Struckius,</HI> vpon the same. As for vs we will content our selues in this place with a few peculiar obseruations of this sea, gleaned heere and there out of the ancient monuments of learned writers of former ages. <HI>It is sweet,</HI> or at leastwise more sweet than other seas: moreouer, <HI>the waters of it are more light than others; and do neuer ebbe and flow,</HI> but alwaies keep one and the same stint of run∣ning one way, as <HI>Lucrece, Macrobius, Pliny</HI> and <HI>Ouid</HI> do witnesse. Which I take to be the cause that sometime it hath all been frozen ouer. For this I re∣member I haue read, in <HI>Ouid, Marcell. Comit.</HI> and others, sometime to haue happened. <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his Problemes writeth, <HI>That it is whiter than other seas:</HI> (yet the Greekes now call it <HI>Maurothalassa,</HI> and likewise the Turkes <HI>Caradenis,</HI> that is, as <HI>Lucian</HI> doth interpret them both, <HI>Mare nigrum,</HI> the Blacke sea. Contrariwise <HI>mare Aegeum,</HI> the Archipelago, or Mediterran sea, the Turkes call <HI>Acdeniz,</HI> and the vulgar Greekes <HI>Aspra thalassa,</HI> both signifying as the learned <HI>Leunclaw</HI> expoundeth them, <HI>Mare album,</HI> the white sea.) <HI>Aelianus</HI> in his <HI>Varia historia</HI> writeth, <HI>That it breedeth no tender or soft shelfish,</HI> but ve∣ry seldome and those very few. <HI>It feedeth no Whales,</HI> only certaine small seales, and pretty little dolphins sometimes are heere taken, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his <HI>Morals</HI> hath left recorded. <HI>There is no rauenous creature that praieth vpon fish doth liue in it,</HI> beside seales and dolphines, as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth. <HI>Strabo</HI> in the se∣uenth booke of his Geography saith, <HI>That there are about</HI> 40. <HI>riuers,</HI> which comming from diuers quarters do vnload themselues into it. Yet we, in this our Mappe, do point at a great many more beside. The cities, vpon the coast of this sea, more famous, are BYZANTIVM, <HI>(Constantinople)</HI> of which we will say nothing in this place, because we haue before in the mappe of <HI>Thrace</HI> written of it at large, in respect of the narrownesse of the place which is assigned for such like purposes. Then TOMOS (<HI>Tomisuar,</HI> as <HI>Calcagninus;</HI> or <HI>Kiouia,</HI> as <HI>Ciofánus</HI> thinketh) famous by the banishment and exile of the noble poet <HI>Ouid.</HI> BORYSTHENES, otherwise called <HI>Olbia</HI> and <HI>Miletopolis, (Strapenor,</HI> a city in <HI>Sarmatia Europaea,</HI> situate at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Bori∣sthenes</HI>) of which <HI>Dion Prusaeus</HI> hath spoken much (that I may omit others) in his 16. oration. DIOSCVRIAS, which was also called <HI>Sebastopolis,</HI> built, if you will giue any credit to poeticall fables, by the waggoners of <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux:</HI> it is yet to this day knowen by the name of <HI>Sauatopoli</HI> or <HI>Sauastopoli.</HI> This city was in times past so famous, as <HI>Pliny</HI> telleth out of <HI>Timosthenes,</HI> that there ordinarily resorted vnto it 300. seuerall nations, speaking so many dif∣ferent languages: so that the Romanes for the dispatch of all matters for their state, did maintaine there 130. interpretours. There are heere many other cities, which were nothing so renowmed, as TRAPEZVS (now vulgarly called TREBIZONDA: of the Turkes, <HI>Tarabasson:</HI> but of the barbarous nati∣ons neere adioining, as <HI>Theuet</HI> reporteth, <HI>Waccamah:</HI> CERASVS (<HI>Cherasoda,</HI> or as the barbarous people call it, <HI>Omidie</HI>) PHARNACEA <HI>(Platena)</HI> A∣MISVS (<HI>Amid</HI> or <HI>Hemid,</HI> or as <HI>Niger</HI> thinketh <HI>Simiso</HI>) SINOPE (<HI>Pordapas,</HI> yet the Turkes to this day call it <HI>Sinabe</HI>) HERACLEA (<HI>Aupop,</HI> and <HI>Penda∣rachia</HI>) and oueragainst <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where we began, is CHALCEDON (<HI>Chalcidona,</HI> or as the Turkes terme it, <HI>Caltitiu</HI>) a free city and of great com∣mand in those daies, but now as <HI>P. Gyllius</HI> saith, it is a small street without any mention of wals. Vpon the West side of this sea, the Thracians did dwell: vpon the South the Asians: as the <HI>Bithynians, Galatians</HI> and <HI>Cappadocians.</HI> The <HI>Colchi</HI> did possesse the Eastern coast. All along generally vpon the North aswell in <HI>Europe</HI> as <HI>Asia,</HI> inhabited the <HI>Sarmatians</HI> and <HI>Scythians,</HI> distinguished into diuers and sundry nations: amongst these are the <HI>Tauroscythi∣ans,</HI> (which tooke their name from thence) and their <HI>Cherronnesus,</HI> or demy-ile, vulgarly knowen by the name of <HI>Taurica Cherronnesus,</HI> and <HI>Scythica Cherronnesus. Appianus</HI> nameth it <HI>Pontica Cherronnesus,</HI> the demy-ile of <HI>Pontus:</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, was sometime inuironed round with the sea. For forme and quality it is compared and thought to be much like <HI>Peloponnesus. Strabo,</HI> from the mouth or relation of others, hath left written, that it was sometime annexed to the maine land by an <HI>isthmos,</HI> or neckeland of 360. furlongs in length. The country toward <HI>Metopon (Frons Arietis</HI> the rammes head) is rough, mountainous and much subiect to Northren stormes, cold and violent blasts. Neere to <HI>Theodosia, (Caffa</HI> or <HI>Cofe,</HI> as the Turkes write it: a city situate vpon the sea, whose hauen is so capacious and large, that it is able to entertaine an hundred tall shippes at once) it is a good and fertile soile. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> writeth that <HI>bulbi,</HI> certaine bolled rootes, which do grow heere of their owne accord, are so sweet and pleasant that they may be eaten raw. In it also is the hill <HI>Berosus,</HI> where, as <HI>Pliny</HI> witnesseth, are three wels, of which, whosoeuer drinketh, he dieth without any griefe and without any remedy. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Tanais,</HI> maketh mention of an oile made in this mountaine <HI>Berosus,</HI> which the country people do presse out of a certaine plant which they call <HI>Halinda.</HI> With this oile they annoint themselues, and then being once warme they feele not the cold although it be neuer so bitter. The same authour telleth of the hearb <HI>Phryxa,</HI> which groweth about <HI>Borea antrum,</HI> the caue <HI>Borea,</HI> which if the stepchildren shall haue about them, they shall suf∣fer no wrong at their stepmothers hand. This hearb is colder than Snow: yet as soone as euer the stepmothers shall go about to wrong their sonne in lawes, it presently casteth out flames of fire: and by that meanes they shunne all eminent dangers and causes of feare. Thus far of <HI>Cherronnesus Taurica.</HI></P>
<P>They which take any pleasure in fables or fictions of poets belonging to this <HI>Pontus</HI> or spoken of the same, let them haue recourse to <HI>Senecan Medra,</HI> or the <HI>Iphigenia</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI> and others that haue written of the voiages of the <HI>Argonautes,</HI> or the story of <HI>Iasons Golden fleece.</HI> But before I leaue this sea I thinke it not amisse to put thee in mind what <HI>Iosephus</HI> writeth in the 11. chapter of his 9. booke of the Antiquity of the Iewes. Hee there saith that <HI>Ionas</HI> the Prophet being deuoured and swallowed vp of the whale about <HI>Issicus finus (Golfo de Atazzo,</HI> a bay of the mediterran sea, neere to <HI>Issus,</HI> a city of <HI>Sili∣cia,</HI> which now they vulgarly call <HI>Atazzo</HI>) was after three daies cast vp againe, into this Euxine sea, aliue vnhurt or any way perished. One part of this his relation I will beleeue, if you will beleeue the other. <HI>Robertus Constantinus</HI> in his supplement of the Latine tongue saith, that <HI>Lamia</HI> was a fish. Of the fenne MAEOTIS, (<HI>Mar delle Sabacche,</HI> it is commonly called now a daies: the Italians, of a towne abuttant vpon it, name it <HI>Mar della Tana,</HI> and <HI>Mar bianco,</HI> the white sea: of the Scythians it is called <HI>Carpaluc:</HI> of the Arabians <HI>Bohari'lazach,</HI> as <HI>Baptista Ramusius</HI> witnesseth) beside other Geographers, read <HI>Polyb.</HI> in his 4. booke, and <HI>Arist.</HI> in the end of his 1. booke, and beginning of the 2. of his <HI>Meteor.</HI> The length of it is 6000. as <HI>Themistius Euphrada</HI> writeth. In this sea there are not many ilands, yet these are not all inhabited or manured; and the people which dwell in them do liue very poorly: for they vse the flesh of great fishes, dried in the sunne, and then beaten and stamped to powder, in steed or meale for bread: for as <HI>Pomponeus</HI> saith, they yeeld no great store of prouision for victuals.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Nder the name of <HI>THRACIA</HI> many and diuerse countries with sundry people are comprehended: for except the Indies it is the greatest country of the world as <HI>Herodotus</HI> doth testifie: for <HI>Pliny</HI> doth confine it by the riuer <HI>Ister, Pontus, Propon∣tis,</HI> the Aegean sea, and the riuer <HI>Strymon.</HI> Yea and <HI>Strabo</HI> in the first booke of his Geography, according to the opinion of <HI>Homer,</HI> extendeth it as farre that way as the riuer <HI>Peneus,</HI> which riuer <HI>Ptolemey</HI> attributeth to <HI>Macedonia. Mar∣cellinus</HI> maketh the Scordisci to be a people of this country. <HI>Appianus</HI> to these conioineth the Illyrians. So also doth <HI>Mela</HI> vpon the West, who moreouer vpon the South to it doth assigne the mount <HI>Athos.</HI> Many of the ancient writers likewise doe make the peninsula or demy-iland <HI>Pallene,</HI> a portion belonging to this country. Yea if one may credit <HI>Eratosthenes,</HI> the hill <HI>Olympus</HI> doth part <HI>Macedonia</HI> from <HI>Thrace.</HI> And the Epitome of <HI>Strabo</HI> in his seuenth booke maketh yet a farre other description of the bounds of this region. (For in <HI>Strabo</HI> himselfe the description of <HI>Thracia</HI> is wholly missing.) This Epitome, I say, seuereth <HI>Thrace</HI> from <HI>Macedony</HI> by the mouth of the riuer <HI>Nessus.</HI> Yea and indeed in succedent ages the compasse of this country was not much lesse: for <HI>Ammianus, Procopius, Sextus Rufus,</HI> and the booke of Records <HI>(Notiti∣arum)</HI> do diuide it into these sixe shires or prouinces; <HI>Moesia,</HI> the Second or Lower, <HI>Scythia, Europa,</HI> (peculiarly calling this part by the generall name of that quarter of the world wherein the whole did stand) <HI>Rhodopa, Haemimontus,</HI> and <HI>Thracia,</HI> properly and specially so called. Heere hence it is that in <HI>Trebellius</HI> and <HI>Orosius;</HI> there is mention made of the <HI>THRACIA'S,</HI> in the plurall number. Yet this our Mappe is not so farre extended toward the North. For we haue indeed followed the description of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in butting and bounding it; who seuereth it from other Northren countries by the mount <HI>Haemus.</HI> And this true <HI>THRACIA</HI> we do thinke to haue beene so named of the inchanting Nymph <HI>Thraca,</HI> as <HI>Eustathius</HI> out of <HI>Athenaeus</HI> teacheth vs; hauing been in former times called <HI>PERCA:</HI> And had beene also sometime, as many do verily thinke, knowne by the names of <HI>ARIA, ODRYSA, CRE∣STONIA</HI> and <HI>SCYTONIA. Iosephus</HI> a most graue authour affirmeth, that it was of the Iewes called <HI>THYRAS.</HI> The abouenamed <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in it na∣meth these foureteene shires, <HI>Dantheletica, Sardica, Vsdicefica, Selletica, Moedica, Drosica, Coeletica, Sapaica, Corpialica, Coenica, Bessica, Bennica, Samaica,</HI> and <HI>Vrbana. Plinie</HI> diuideth it into fifty (or two and fifty, as I remember <HI>Dalechampius</HI> hath) Regiments, <HI>(Strategiae)</HI> shirewickes, I thinke, they call them in some places of <HI>England,</HI> Hundreds, or Wapentakes I would call them. This <HI>Thracia,</HI> properly so called, <HI>Ammianus</HI> likeneth vnto the halfe Moone: or, to a Theater, whose higher part is enclosed with high and steep mountaines, which do diuide this same country from <HI>Dacia;</HI> The lower part openeth toward the Aegean sea.</P>
<P>Of the nature and quality of this country, <HI>Virgil</HI> speaketh on this manner: <HI>Terra procul vastis colitur Mauortia campis:</HI> A martiall country li'th farre off, vast champions it conteinth: <HI>Plutarch</HI> teacheth vs that it hath in it many huge fennes and bogges, and that it is diuided or crossed this way and that way by diuerse deep and dangerous riuers. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith that the soile of <HI>Thracia</HI> is very fertile for all manner of corne, and commendeth the wheat of the same, for waight and heauinesse: <HI>Item,</HI> for goodnesse he affirmeth that this kinde of wheat possesseth the third place. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> testifieth that it beareth some vines, especially about <HI>Biblina,</HI> which otherwise is called <HI>Oesyma. Item, Pliny</HI> highly commendeth <HI>Vinum Maroneum,</HI> the wine of <HI>Marogna,</HI> or <HI>Marolia,</HI> as <HI>Lewnclawe</HI> calleth it. <HI>Homer</HI> also affirmeth, that the Achiui were wont, by shippe to transport wines from <HI>Thace</HI> into <HI>Grecce. Xenophon</HI> writeth, that in the mount <HI>Pangeus,</HI> there is a gold-mine: and <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth the like to be about <HI>Philippi.</HI> Heere also is the <HI>Thracian stone,</HI> which is kindled by the water, and quenched with oile, as <HI>Pliny</HI> witnesseth. But because no man of all the ancient writers, hath better described this countrie than <HI>Pomponius Me∣la,</HI> let vs heere him speake: It is, saith he, a countrie that cannot much bragge either of the goodnesse of their soile, or wholesomenesse of their aire: nay indeed, except it be in some place neere the sea coast, it is barren, cold, and verie vnkinde to all things generally that are set, sowne, or laid into the same. It seldome beareth any apple-trees or other fruit-trees: yet vines do heere and there grow in diuers places: but the grapes neuer ripen kindly, or come to any perfection, except in some places where the vine-dressers do, by the leaues, keepe the cold from them. It is a countrey much more kinde to men: yet they are none of the properest: for they are very clownish, vnhandsome and rough hewed fellowes: but otherwise for number and hardinesse (for they are many and those very vn∣ciuill) this nation farre surpasseth others neere adioining. This latter also is auerred by <HI>Pausanias</HI> who affirmeth it to containe such wonderfull multitudes of men, that, if you shall except <HI>France (Gallia)</HI> it may for ought that I know, in all likely-hood, for multitude of men be preferred before any countrie in the world. <HI>Item, Herodotus</HI> saith, that next after the Indies, it is the greatest countrey of the whole earth. <HI>Liuy</HI> calleth it a desperate and most fierce Nation: and <HI>Solinus</HI> he saith, that they are a verie stout and hardy people: <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> maketh them the most cruell and furious people that euer he saw or heard of: which <HI>Florus</HI> well expresseth by this example, when he writeth that certaine of them being taken by the Romanes, and giued as the manner of captiises is, did bite the fetters and manacles with their teeth, and so themselues to haue sufficiently punished their owne barbarous cruelty: and that there are of their parents euen from their cradle trained vp to this wild inhumane kinde of life, <HI>Sidonius</HI> doth teach vs in these words: <HI>Excipit hic natos glacies, &amp; matris ab aluo Artus infantum molles nix cimbrica durat. Pectore vixaliter quisquam, sed ab vbere tractus. Plus potat per vulnus equum, sic lacte relicto, Virtutem gens tota bibit. Creuere parumper, Mox pugnam ludunt iaculis: hos suggerit illis. Nutrix plaga iocos: pueri venatibus apti, Lustra feris vacuant. rapto ditata iuuentus, Iura colit gladij. consummatámque senectam Non ferro finire pudet. Tali ordine vitae Ciues Martis agunt.</HI> So soone as infant heere is borne, The thing they say is sure, To frost and snow their tender limmes They presently inure. Scarce one of ma∣ny thousands heere, Doth sucke the Nurces teate: Warme blood of warlike horses heere, For most part's infants meat: This diet mak'th them bold and hard. And as they come to growth They learne to tosse the speare and pike: Heere no man liueth in slowth. These are the sports that these men vse: As soone as boies can ride The fallow deere they learne to chase: &amp;c. But to these let vs adde that commendation of them, giuen by the Emperour <HI>Iustinian</HI> in his <HI>Authentica:</HI> That is most certaine, saith he, and for a truth confessed of all men, That if any one do but name the countrie of <HI>Thracia,</HI> by and by together as soone as the word is out of his mouth, there presently entreth into the heart of the stander by, a conceit of manhood and warlike valour fit for all manner of ser∣uice in the field. For these things naturally bred in the bone, and as it were proper qualities peculiar to this country onely. <HI>Valerius Maximus</HI> highly commen∣deth the valorous wisedome <HI>(Animosam sapientiam)</HI> of the Thracians. Yet <HI>Thucydides</HI> saith it was such, as it was the next doore to barbarous crueltie: wheresoeuer the Thracian is secure and thinketh he may safely insult, there he is most bloudy and tyrannous. When it thundereth and lightneth, they shoote their arrowes vp into the aire, threatning euen God himselfe, for that indeed they thinke there is no other God but that whom they adore. These gods, as <HI>He∣rodotus</HI> writeth. <HI>Mars, Bacchus, Diana</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI> they worship onely and none other. Yet the same authour in another place nameth <HI>Plistorius,</HI> for a God proper vnto this nation onely. <HI>Ammianus</HI> also writeth that these people do worship the gooddesse <HI>Bellona.</HI> To these their gods, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> affirmeth, they slew and sacrificed men, before they set forward and attempted to daren battell. In which they vsed, by the report of <HI>Liuy,</HI> two hand swords of an huge length. Their salades or head peeces were of woolues skins, euery man wearing his dart, and his target with a short dagger or poinyard. Euery man heere thinketh it a gallant thing and very honourable to liue by the warres, and by robbing and spoiling. An idle fellow heere is accounted for a right honest man: and it is a most base and contemptible thing to be an husbandman. <HI>Clemens</HI> in the seuenth booke of his <HI>Stromaton</HI> writeth, that these people are of complexion and colour lion tawney, and wanne, or as it were of a skie colour. <HI>Homer</HI> calleth them <HI>Comatos Thraces,</HI> Long-locked Thracians: <HI>Iulius Pollux, In vertice crinitos,</HI> wearing a long-locke vpon the crowne of the head. It was accounted for an honourable thing amongst them to haue their faces full of skarres: and in∣deed <HI>Herodotus</HI> saith, that it was no disgrace to any man. Yea and <HI>Plutarch</HI> addeth that they vsed to imprinte markes vpon their wiues faces: which <HI>Athe∣naeus</HI> in the twelfth booke of his <HI>Deipnosophiston</HI> iustifieth to be true. <HI>Heraclides</HI> and <HI>Sextus Empiricus</HI> do iointly affirme, that euery man vsually had more wiues than one. It is very certaine, that they were great drinkers of wine and sound drunkerds, and that they brewed their wine with hony, we learne out of <HI>Pliny.</HI> Yet in <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> I read that diuerse of them did neuer know what wine meant; but when they meant to be merrie, sitting round about the hearth, certaine seedes were strawen vpon the coales, which cast vp such a smoake or steame, that it made euery man so light-headed and pleasant, as if he had beene cup shot, or had taken a pot or two too much of strongest beere or wine that might be drunke. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> also writeth that they had heere a kinde of drinke which they called <HI>Brytum,</HI> made of barly and other kinds of corne. <HI>Suidas</HI> writeth, that what wine soeuer the pot-companions, in their quaffings and carowsings could not drinke out was presently powred vpon their heads. The same authour reporteth, that they are much delighted to eate garleeke, as being indeeed of it selfe very hot, and their country wherein they dwell very bleake and cold. <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> writeth, that they vsed to exchange slaues for salt. Whereupon <HI>Sale empti,</HI> bought with salt, was spoken prouerbially of bad seruants and such as were taken vp at iade-faire. <HI>Item,</HI> he affirmeth, that this nation first inuen∣ted a kinde of musicall instrument called <HI>Canthorum.</HI> But of the manners and behauiour of this people, many other things may be obserued in the reading of those authours which before I haue cited, especially in <HI>Herodotus, Athenaeus, Solinus, Pomponius Mela,</HI> and <HI>Heraclides</HI> his Policies. These, although meere Barbarians and vnlearned, yet in this one thing, diuerse of them iudged not amisse, in that they thought and verily beleeued the soule to be immortall: others did thinke that it did die, yet so as that it was in better estate then when it liued. Heereupon it is, that they morned when women were brought in bed, and wept at the birth of their children. An ancient writer affirmeth, that there was a kind of nation of the Thracians that could not reckon further then the number of foure, any greater number they could not remember. Now it remaineth that we should, out of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> say something of the miracles, and strange things found and obserued in this countrie. In <HI>Chalcidis,</HI> a prouince heere, there is a place called <HI>Cantharoletron;</HI> for that any beast that goeth in thither, may come safe and sound out againe: saue only the beast called <HI>Cantharus:</HI> these neuer come out from thence aliue, but they presently fall a turning

<PB REF="299"/> round vntill they die. In this countrie is the riuer <HI>Cochryna,</HI> of whose water if any sheepe do drinke, they bring foorth none but blacke lambes. Between <HI>By∣zantium (Constantinople)</HI> and the Chersonesus, there is an hill which they call <HI>The holy mount,</HI> neere to which, the sea oftentimes carieth vpon the top of his waters a kinde of slimy substance called of the Latines, <HI>Bitumen.</HI> In <HI>Agria,</HI> a shire of this country, the riuer <HI>Pontus,</HI> carieth downe in his channell cer∣taine stones much like vnto coales: which being kindled, and water cast vpon them, they burne the better: but being blowne with bellowes, they go quite out. There is no manner of vermine or venemous creatures that can abide the smell of this kinde of siring. Amongst the <HI>Cinchropsoses</HI> there is a fountaine, of whose water, whosoeuer shall drinke they die immediately. In <HI>Botiaea,</HI> there groweth a stone, which by the heat or reuerberation of the Sunne beames kindleth, and casteth foorth sparks and flames of fire. <HI>Plutarch</HI> writeth, that there is a spring not farre from the hill <HI>Pangaeus,</HI> of whose waters if one fill one and the same vessell, and then weight it, he shall finde it to be twise so heauy in the winter, as it was in the summer. <HI>Plutarch</HI> (whom <HI>Tzetzes</HI> calleth, The yonger: another nameth him <HI>Parthenicus</HI>) reporteth certaine things of the herbe <HI>Cythara,</HI> the stones <HI>Pansilypus</HI> and <HI>Philadelphi,</HI> found in the riuers <HI>Ebrus</HI> and <HI>Strymon:</HI> which, because they are more like to fables, than true stories, I do in this place willingly omit. To reckon vp heere the seuerall Nations, Moun∣taines, Riuers or Cities of this country, I thinke it nothing necessary: because they are at one view better to be seene in the Mappe it selfe. Yet of the city <HI>By∣zantium</HI> (now <HI>Constantinople</HI>) for that it is sooft mentioned in ancient histories, to say nothing at all, for that we do in some sort hold it an iniury, I thinke it not amisse to write these few lines following, of the description of it. The first founder of <HI>BYZANTIVM,</HI> which was also in times past called <HI>LYGOS,</HI> was, as <HI>Trogus</HI> and <HI>Eustathius</HI> do thinke, one <HI>Pausanias</HI> a Captaine of the Spartanes: and that, as <HI>Cassiodorus</HI> writeth, at such time as <HI>Numa Pompilius</HI> was king of the Romanes. It was so called of <HI>Byzantes,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Ceroessas,</HI> a captaine of the Megareans: whom <HI>Eustathius</HI> affirmeth, to haue beene the vp∣rightest and most iust man that euer the earth did beare. This city is situate vpon an high cliffe, at the narrowest place of <HI>Bosphorus, Thracius</HI> (the frith or streights of <HI>Constantinople</HI>) in a very fertile soile, and vpon a fruitfull and commodious sea <HI>(fertili solo &amp; foecundo salo)</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> writeth. In respect of which situation, being strongly fortified by nature, it is thought to be almost inuincible. Whereupon <HI>Trebellius Pollio</HI> calleth it <HI>claustrum Ponticum,</HI> The blocke-house of <HI>Pontus. Orosius</HI> termeth it, <HI>Principem gentium,</HI> the soueraigne of all Nations; <HI>Sextus Rufus, Arcem secundam Romani orbis,</HI> The second bulwarke or fortresse of the Romane Empire: <HI>Procopius, Arcem Europae &amp; Asiae obicem ponentem,</HI> The Castle of <HI>Europe,</HI> and barre against <HI>Asia: Themistocles Euphrada, Magnificentiae officinam,</HI> The shop of all manner of brauery and courtlike fashions: and <HI>Ouid</HI> he calleth it, <HI>Vastam gemini maris ianuam,</HI> The huge gate of the two seas, to wit, <HI>Propontis (Mar di marmora)</HI> and <HI>Pontus Euxinus (Mar maiore.)</HI> For the rampart and wals of it (which <HI>Pausanias</HI> and both the <HI>Dions</HI> so highly commend) were so strong that the Athenians vsed in former times, as the same <HI>Eustathius</HI> writeth, to cary all their goods and treasure thither and there to bestow it, holding it to be a place impregnable and not to be surprized by any enemy whatsoeuer. Of the great felicity of this city you may read many things worth the obseruation in diuerse ancient writers; especially in <HI>Polybius, Herodian, Xiphiline, Dion Prusens,</HI> and <HI>Themistocles Euphrada</HI> in his sixth oration: who deemeth the citizens thereof to be most happie men, both for the goodly riuer which passeth by it, temperature of the aire, fertility of the soile wherein it standeth, capacious hauen and creeke of the sea, gorgeous church and stately wals of the same. Heerupon grew that daintinesse, luxury, drunkennesse and wantonnesse of these people: which vices of theirs are noted by <HI>Athenaeus</HI> in the tenth booke of his <HI>Deipnosophiston:</HI> and <HI>Aelianus</HI> in the foureteenth chapter of the third booke of his <HI>varia historia.</HI> This city, fortune often frowning vpon it, was sometimes possessed of the Spartans or Lacedemonians: after that it was vnder the command of the Athenians. Then shaking off their yoke, it began by a little and a little to chalenge vnto it selfe a kinde of soueraignty and freedome from any forren iurisdiction: which it held for a while, vntill <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Romane Emperour, subdued it, and reduced it vnto the forme of a prouince. While it thus stoode vnder the command of the Romanes, it was, by <HI>Septimius Seuerus,</HI> who held on <HI>Nigers</HI> side, assaulted, battered, raced to the ground, and of a goodly flourishing city, made a poore and beggerly village, and withall was adiudged to belong vn∣to the <HI>Perinthij.</HI> But <HI>Antonius Caracalla, Seuerus</HI> his sonne, restored them to their ancient liberties, and was called by the name of <HI>ANTONIA,</HI> as <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI> testifieth. Yet for <HI>Antonia</HI> (that I may note this by the way) an ancient brasse coine, of the Emperour <HI>Seuerus</HI> which I haue, doth teach vs that it ought to be read <HI>Antoninia.</HI> For vpon this peece of money was stamped <HI>ΑΝΤΟΝΕΙΝΙΑ ΒΥΖΑΝΤΙΩΝ ΣΕΒΑΣΤΑ,</HI> that is, <HI>An∣toninia the Emperiall city of the Bizantini.</HI> But after this it was againe wasted by <HI>Gallienus</HI> the Emperour, and all the citizens and garrison souldiers thereof slaine and put to the sword. Yet for feare least the Scythians, Getes and other barbarous nations might breake in to the Romane territories on that side, it was againe reedified, repaired and fortified by the same Emperour. But <HI>Constantine,</HI> worthily in deed and name surnamed the Great, did yet farre more strongly fortifie it: and adorne it with the most goodly temple of <HI>Santa Sophia:</HI> and moreouer gracing it with many stately ornaments and curious workes of Architecture which he caused to be brought out of <HI>Asia, Africa, Europe,</HI> yea and from <HI>Rome</HI> it selfe, and after his owne name by proclamation caused it to be intituled and called by the name of <HI>CONSTANTINOPOLIS,</HI> that is, Constantines city. <HI>Item,</HI> he tooke it from the <HI>Perinthij,</HI> made it a free cor∣poration and endowed it with many large and ample priuiledges. After him, as <HI>Themistius Euphrada</HI> in his sixth oration testifieth, <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Great did beautifie it with diuerse gorgeous and costly buildings. Moreouer <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperour, as <HI>Procopius</HI> an eie-witnesse affirmeth, adorned it with ma∣ny most faire and beautifull workes of curious Architecture. But especially he graced it by that glorious worke of that stately temple of <HI>Santa Sophia,</HI> which he repaired (being a little before burnt downe, and vtterly defaced by fire) and of it bestowed such cost, that the Emperour himselfe, as <HI>Glycas</HI> witnesseth, bold∣ly said that in this edifice he had exceeded euen glorious king <HI>Salomon,</HI> in that his building. Which worke of his, as <HI>P. Diaconus</HI> writeth of it, did so much excell all other buildings, that in the whole world beside there was not to be found another that might in any respect be compared vnto it. Whereupon <HI>Corippus</HI> thus speak th of this Church: <HI>Iam Solomoniaci sileat descriptio templi, Cedant cunctorum miracula nota locorum.</HI> That stately worke of <HI>Salomon,</HI> great <HI>Iudahs</HI> glorious king, May now be still and bragge no more: The greatest woonders of the world, may well giue place to this, No eie hath seene the like be∣fore. <HI>Consta. Manasses</HI> calleth it <HI>Orbis ornamentum,</HI> The glorie of the world, which he verily beleeueth the very Seraphim themselues did reuerence and adore. But if any one be desirous to know the fashion and modell of this building, let him haue recourse to <HI>Procopius</HI> his first booke of <HI>Edifices.</HI> Of this church <HI>Paulus Lyrus Florus</HI> wrote a treatise in heroike or hexameter verse, as <HI>Agathias</HI> in his fifth booke testifieth. So that it might seeme that there was nothing more that might be wished for the further beautifying of this city. <HI>Sozomen</HI> doubted not boldly to affirme, That <HI>Constantinople</HI> both for multitude of men, and store of wealth and money, by all mens ioint consent, did farre excell euen great <HI>Rome</HI> it selfe. Moreouer <HI>Nazianzen</HI> writeth, That <HI>Constantinople</HI> for beauty and brauerie, did as much excell all other cities of the world beside, as the highest heauens in glory do exceed the lowest elements. Whereupon of some it was graced with these proud titles, <HI>VRBS AETERNAE, VRBS REGIA, NOVA &amp; SECVNDA ROMA, The eternall City, The Emperi∣all City; New</HI> Rome, and <HI>Another</HI> Rome. In the praising and tax of the chiefe cities of the Romane Empire, this city, in a Councell there held, was placed in the second degree: but in former times, as <HI>Egesippus</HI> testifieth, it possessed only the third place. <HI>Zosimus</HI> writeth, that there is no other city whatsoeuer, whe∣ther you respect the large compasse and circuite of the wals, or great felicity of it euery way, that may iustly be compared vnto it. The buildings of it are so close and neere together and the houses and streets are so pestered and thronged, that whether a man keepe home or walke abroad he shall be so crowded and thrust, that scarcely he might go without danger, by reason of the huge throng of men and infinite of multitude of cattle alwaies passing to and fro in the same. He that desireth to know all the glorious ornaments and woonderfull things worthy of obseruation to be seene in this city, let him read <HI>George Cedren</HI> his historie of the life of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Great. Where he doth not onelie receite them all and reckon them vp curiously, but also he doth most artificially describe them and paint them out in their true colours. This city was taken, in the yeere of Christ <HI>1453.</HI> by Mahomet the first of that name, Emperour of the Turkes, who at this daie do yet possesse it. Manie other things pertaining to the beautie and magnificence of this city are to be seene in the booke of Records of both the Empires, and in <HI>Procopius</HI> his first booke <HI>De Aedificijs.</HI> Of the originall and famous buildings of this city, read <HI>George Codinus:</HI> for no man hath handled that argument better than he. But of the later writers, <HI>Petrus Gyllius</HI> hath most exactly and learnedly described the same. Of the Thracians, this one thing in this place I cannot omit; namely, That in former times they bore a great sway in forren countries, and were great Lords out of their owne natiue soile. For they conquered and had vnder them a great part of <HI>Asia,</HI> which is situate ouer against them, and caused it after their name to be called <HI>THRACIA ASIATICA:</HI> yea and toward the South, beyond the bounds of their owne country, vpon the Aegean sea (where <HI>Pausanias</HI> described <HI>THRACIA CARIA</HI>) they had long since placed their colonies. This prouince, <HI>Porphyrogenneta</HI> calleth <HI>THRACESIVM. Xenophon</HI> doubted not to call this kingdome the greatest of all other between the Ionian sea and <HI>Pontus Euxinus.</HI> Moreouer <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh mention, of a certaine nation, dwelling aboue <HI>Armenia,</HI> which were called <HI>Thra∣ces Seraperae.</HI> To this <HI>Thracia,</HI> is annexed a <HI>Chersonesus</HI> or Neckland, which thereupon was sirnamed <HI>THRACIA CHERSONESVS. Suidas</HI> cal∣leth it <HI>CHERSONESVS HELEESPONTIACA,</HI> of the sea <HI>Hellespontus,</HI> neere neighbour vnto it. It is also named <HI>PALLENE</HI> of <HI>Halicarnasseus</HI> and <HI>Stephanus,</HI> who moreouer addeth, that it was inhabited of the <HI>Crusaei. Xenophon</HI> saith, it was a most rich soile, and fertile of all manner of things what∣soeuer: and withall affirmeth that in it were eleuen or twelue great and goodly townes. But wee out of all ancient Historians haue much exceeded this number, as the Mappe doth sufficiently approue. This Neckland or <HI>Chersonesus</HI> belonged sometime to <HI>Marcus Agrippa,</HI> after whose decease, as <HI>Dion</HI> reporteth, it fell vnto <HI>Augustus Caesar.</HI> He that desireth out of ancient writers, a more ample description of <HI>Thracia,</HI> let him read <HI>Wolfangus Lazius</HI> his Histories of <HI>Greece: Item,</HI> the fifth booke of <HI>Agathias</HI> a Grecian borne. A strange thing it is that <HI>William Brussius</HI> writeth of this <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> that by no manner of meanes or diligence vines can be made to grow heere in any great abundance.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat country which the Latines call GRAECIA, <HI>Greece,</HI> of the Greekes themselues general∣ly was named HELLAS: yet the out-borders of it are not the same, according to euery mans description and limitation. That was truly and most anciently called <HI>Greece,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemey, Pliny</HI> and <HI>Mela,</HI> name ACHAIA; in which <HI>Athens,</HI> the first and most flourishing Vniuersity of the World, and most renowmed citie of these parts was seated. Heere <HI>Iupi∣ter</HI> himselfe, as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> witnesseth, kept his Court. It is a free city, as <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth it, and needeth as he saith, no further commendations, so famous and honourable it is, and euer hath been beyond all measure or conceipt of man. Yet it is manifest, not only out of the writers of the common sort of Historiographers, but also euen out of <HI>Strabo</HI> himselfe, the prince of Geogra∣phers, that many countries are comprehended vnder the name of <HI>Graecia</HI> or <HI>Hellas,</HI> as namely, <HI>Macedonia, Epirus, Peloponnesus,</HI> and those other prouinces and shires, conteined vnder these names: so that all <HI>Greece,</HI> as it is gene∣rally taken, is on three sides bounded with the <HI>Ionian, Aegean (Archipelago)</HI> and the <HI>Libyan</HI> seas: toward the maine land it abutteth vpon those mountaines which do part <HI>Macedonia</HI> from <HI>Thracia, (Romania) Mysia</HI> the vpper, (<HI>Ser∣uia, Bosna</HI> and <HI>Bulgaria,</HI>) and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> (now it is called <HI>Sclauonia.</HI>) This is that <HI>Greece,</HI> which, as <HI>Manilius</HI> saith, is <HI>Maxima terra viris, &amp; foecundissima doctis Vrbibus,</HI> &amp;c. Renowmed <HI>Greece,</HI> for warlike men, and schollers deeply learned, doth farre excell— &amp;c. which, (as <HI>Cicero</HI> writeth in his oration <HI>pro Flacco) for honour, renowme, learning, diuers arts and sciences, ciuill policy in time of peace, and feates of armes and martiall chiualrie abroad, hath euer been famous:</HI> or, as <HI>Tro∣gus Pompeius</HI> in his 8. booke saith, was for valour and estimation, <HI>Princesse of the World.</HI> From hence, as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, the bright lusture of all maner of literature and humane learning, first call forth his beames, and enlightned the rest of the world on all sides round about.</P>
<P>In this country humanity and letters together with the maner to write and read, how to till the ground and sow corne, was first inuented and practised, as <HI>Plinius Caecilius</HI> hath left recorded in his epistle written to his friend <HI>Maximus:</HI> And this is that country, saith he, from whom we had our statutes: that I meane, which receiued not lawes, as those do which are at the command of the conquerour, but willingly and curteously did communi∣cate them, to such as did demand them. MACEDONIA, possesseth the greatest part of <HI>Greece.</HI> This long since hauing conquered the greatest part of the World, passing through <HI>Asia</HI> the Lesse, <HI>Armenia, Iberia, Albania, Cappa∣docia, Syria, Aegypt,</HI> the mountaines <HI>Taurus</HI> and <HI>Caucasus,</HI> subdued <HI>Bactria, Media, Persia</HI> and the rest of those Eastern countries, euen as farre as <HI>India;</HI> (in this following the steps of <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Hercules</HI>) of which also it became the Empresse, yea thou maist say, if thou wilt, of the whole world, answeareable to that of <HI>Manilius, — &amp; Macedum tellus quae vicerat Orbem:</HI> — and <HI>Macedonia</HI> stout which all the world subdued. This is that <HI>Macedonia,</HI> 72. of whose cities, <HI>Paulus Aemilius,</HI> a Romane Consull, sacked and sold in one day. Then next after this followeth PELO∣PONNESVS, a <HI>peninsula</HI> or demy-ile, (not much inferiour for goodnesse of soile, fertility and riches, to no coun∣try vnder heauen) is very like in forme to the leafe of the plane tree. In this standeth <HI>binaris Corinthus,</HI> the city <HI>Corinth,</HI> the fortresse, bulwarke and gate of all <HI>Greece,</HI> situate between two seas in the <HI>isthmos,</HI> neckeland or narrow place between this prouince and <HI>Achaia.</HI> Heere also is <HI>Lacedaemon (Misithra</HI> or <HI>Zaconia,</HI> as some thinke, but it was in old time called <HI>Sparta</HI>) reuerend and honoured of all men for the politique gouernment &amp; commonwealth in∣stituted by <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> for many memorable acts done both at home and abroad. But that the name of <HI>Greece</HI> did extend it selfe further than before specified, on ech side of the sea, it plainly appeareth out of the records of the best writers: for how great a portion of <HI>Italy</HI> was in old time called <HI>Magna Graecia,</HI> Great <HI>Greece?</HI> A great part also of the maine continent in <HI>Asia,</HI> beyond the sea ouer against <HI>Macedonia,</HI> of certaine colonies transported thither and seated there by the Greekes, was named also by this name: whose inhabitants, <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his <HI>Laconica apothegma∣ta,</HI> for distinction sake, nameth <HI>Graecos Asianos,</HI> Asian Greekes. For <HI>Lucian</HI> in his treatise of Loue, <HI>(de Amoribus)</HI> wri∣teth, that the <HI>insulae Chelidoniae,</HI> certaine small ilands, or rocks, as some call them, in the midland sea (they are now called <HI>Isole corrente,</HI> as <HI>Castaldus</HI> iudgeth, or <HI>Caprose,</HI> as <HI>Pinetus</HI> thinketh:) were the ancient bounds of <HI>Greece. Isocrates</HI> in his oration intituled <HI>Panegyricos,</HI> writeth that the Grecians did inhabit from <HI>Cnidus,</HI> (a town in the prouince of <HI>Doris</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> the Lesser) euen vnto <HI>Sinope</HI> (a city of <HI>Paphlagonia</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> situate vpon the Euxine sea, <HI>Chalcondylas</HI> calleth it <HI>Pordapas,</HI> the Turkes, as <HI>Leunclaw</HI> reporteth, <HI>Sinabe.</HI>) In like maner the <HI>Aegean</HI> sea <HI>(Archipelago)</HI> which beateth vpon the coast of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> and also vpon this forenamed <HI>Asia,</HI> is called of <HI>Thucydides, Plutarch, Arrian</HI> and <HI>Polyenus, (Hellenice thalassa)</HI> of <HI>Pliny Graeciense mare,</HI> the Greeke sea. <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pausanias,</HI> amongst the rest, haue described <HI>Greece,</HI> as then it stood, most diligently and curiously.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat this iland was sometimes a part of <HI>Syria</HI> and ioyned to the maine land, <HI>Pliny</HI> in his Naturall history doth affirme: and that it shall againe be reunited to the same, <HI>Apollo</HI> hath prophesied, as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his Geographie hath left recorded. Amongst those ilands of the Midland sea more noted for their greatnesse, this doth possesse the sixth place. In respect of the forme, it is, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> writeth, compared to a sheeps skin: or, as <HI>Hyginus</HI> noteth, to a French target. It is longer one way than another, by the iudgement of <HI>Strabo;</HI> who moreouer addeth, that for excellency and goodnesse of soile, it is inferiour vnto no iland whatsoeuer. <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> do testifie, hat in former times nine kings did reigne in it at once. <HI>Herodotus</HI> sayth, that king <HI>Amasis</HI> was of all mortall men the first that tooke it, and made it tributary vnto his crowne. It was all ouer somtime so woody and ouergrowen with bushes and trees, that the ground by no meanes might be ploughed and manured: a great part of which although it was dayly spent in the melting, and refining of copper and siluer, (for the iland is very full of mettals) as also for the building of ships; yet notwithstanding for all this they neuer were able vtterly to destroy their huge woods and infinite luxuriousnesse of the same, vntill by proclamation free liberty and licence was giuen and granted to euery man that list, to fell and cary away what wood and timber they pleased: Item, that what ground so euer any man had cleared by stocking vp the bushes and trees, that he should for euer after hold for his owne by a free tenure. The woonderfull fertilitie of this soile <HI>Elianus</HI> doth be∣wray, when as he writeth, that stagges and hindes do oft times swim hither out of <HI>Syria</HI> to fill their bellies: so good is the feed of this ile. The manifold variety and plen∣ty of all sorts of commodities here, those words of <HI>Ammian</HI> in his <HI>14</HI> booke do sufficiently demonstrate vnto vs: when he giueth out, That it needeth no maner of forren helpe of other countries, only of it selfe it is able to build a shippe euen from the very keele to the top saile, to rigge it and send it foorth to sea furnished with all maner of necessaries whatsoeuer. The great riches of this iland, these words of <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> do manifestly declare: <HI>CYPRVS famous for great wealth, moued the begger∣ly Romans to attempt the same; so that indeed the interest that we haue in that iland, we gat rather by violence, than any right we had vnto it. Florus</HI> writeth, That the riches of this iland when it was once wholly subdued did fill the Exchequer of the city of <HI>Rome</HI> more full, than any other conquest that euer they got wheresoeuer. <HI>Carystius lapis, (Caristium,</HI> I thinke a kinde of greene marble) a stone of great estimation is found here, as <HI>Antigonus</HI> writeth: and as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifi∣eth, the Diamond, Smaragd, Opalus, Crystall, Alume, and a kinde of whetstone, which they call <HI>Naxium.</HI> The same authour affirmeth, that the Rosen of this iland doth far surpasse that of any other places of the whole world. He also highly commendeth the oiles and vnguents of the same for pleasure and delight, as also their wax and reeds as much for medicines and necessary vse in physicke. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> extolleth their passing faire doues. Fabulous antiquity did verily beleeue that the goddesse <HI>Venus</HI> here first came vp out of the sea: for whose honour and memory peraduenture, the women of <HI>Cyprus</HI> (as the same authour affirmeth) do offer their bodies to be abused of euery man that list. Why it was not lawfull for any Iew to come within the ile of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> reade <HI>Dion</HI> in the history of <HI>Hadrian.</HI> The diuers names of this iland as we haue noted out of sundry authours are these: <HI>ACAMANTIS, AEROSA, AMATHVSA, ASPELIA, CERASTIS, CITIDA, COLINIA, CRYPTVS, MACARIA, MEIONIS,</HI> and <HI>SPHECIA:</HI> of which see more particularly in our Geographicall treasury.

<P>THis iland is seuered by so small a frith, (thus <HI>Solinus</HI> describeth it) from the maine land of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> that it is hard to say whether it be to be accounted amongst the number of the ilands or not: (Thus some haue thought of the <HI>Ile of Wight:</HI>) For on that side, which they call <HI>Euripus,</HI> it is ioined to the continent by a faire bridge, and by the meanes of a very short scaffold one may passe from the firme lana thither on foot: and, as <HI>Procopius</HI> in his <HI>iiij. Aedifi.</HI> testifieth, by the laying ouer, or taking away of one rafter or planke, one may go from one to another on foot or by boat as one please. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth that it was sometime ioined to <HI>Boeotia,</HI> but was afterward seuered from it by an earth-quake: and indeed the whole iland is much subiect to earth-quakes, but especially that frith or <HI>Euripus</HI> which we mentioned a little aboue, as <HI>Strabo</HI> telleth vs; who moreouer addeth that by that meanes a faire citie, of the same name with the ile, was vtterly sunke and swallowed vp of the sea. Of all the ilands of the Midland sea this in bignesse is held to possesse the fifth place. In diuers authours it is called by diuers and sundry names: as <HI>MACRA,</HI> and <HI>MACRIS, ABANTIAS, ASOPIS, OCHE, ELLOPIA, ARCHIBIVM, &amp;c.</HI> Item, <HI>CHALCIS,</HI> of the chiefe and metropolitan city of the same, situate vpon the forenamed frith. This, I say, was the greatest city and metropolitan of all the whole ile, and was of that power and command, that it sent forth colonies into <HI>Macedony, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Sicilia.</HI> In <HI>Lalantus,</HI> that goodly champion, there are, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, certaine hot baths, which <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth <HI>Thermas Ellopias,</HI> The baths of Hellopia. They are very soueraigne against diuers diseases. Here are, as <HI>Strabo</HI> reporteth, the riuers <HI>Cireus</HI> and <HI>Nileus,</HI> of which the one causeth such sheepe as drinke of it to be white, the other blacke. <HI>Pliny</HI> doth also highly commend a kinde of greene marble here which they call <HI>Carystium,</HI> for that it is digged out of a rocke nere the towne <HI>Carystus,</HI> in the East corner of this ile, where also the marble temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> is described by <HI>Strabo.</HI> Copper was first found in this iland: here do growe the woorst firre trees, as <HI>Pliny</HI> affirmeth; item, here bloweth olympias, a winde proper to this countrey: againe, that the fishes taken in the sea here abouts are so salt, that you would iudge them taken out of pickle. Of the <HI>Euripus</HI> (where they say <HI>Aristotle</HI> abode and died) very strange things are tolde by diuers writers; namely that it doth ordinarily ebbe and flowe seuen times in a day, and as many times in the night, and that so violently and high that no windes can preuaile against it, nay and the tallest ships that are, though vnder saile, it driueth to and fro as it listeth. Of all men, <HI>Strabo</HI> in his tenth booke hath most curiously described this iland. See also what <HI>Procopius</HI> in his fourth booke <HI>de Aedificijs Iustiniani,</HI> saith of it. Item, <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius,</HI> in that his Historie of <HI>Greece,</HI> hath set out a very large Commentarie of the same. <HI>Libanius Sophista,</HI> in the life of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> writeth, that it had sometime two and twentie cities. Yet we, in this our Mappe, out of sundry writers, aswell Latines as Greeks, haue gathered together and noted downe the names of many more.</P>

<HEAD>RHODVS.</HEAD>
<P>THe braue and franke <HI>RHODVS,</HI> was also of the ancient called <HI>OPHIVSA, STADIA, TEICHINE, AETHRAEA, CORYMBA, POEESSA, A∣TABYRIA,</HI> and <HI>TRINACRIA,</HI> yea and by diuers other names also, as thou mayest see in our Geographicall treasurie. <HI>Pliny</HI> giueth out that this ile did rise vp out of the bottome of the sea, hauing beene before all drowned and couered ouer with water: and <HI>Ammianus</HI> he writeth, that it was sometime bedrenched and sow∣sed with a golden showre of raine: for the fabulous writers do tell that heere it rained gold, when <HI>Pallas</HI> was borne. Therefore this soile, aboue all other was beloued of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> the mighty king of gods and men, as the poet saith. In <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> we read that it was beloued of the Sun, and made an iland, by the remouing of the water which before had couered it all ouer: for before this it lay hid in the bowels of the sea, or else was so full of bogs and fennes that it was altogether inhabitable. In memory of which kindnesse of louely <HI>Phoebus,</HI> that huge <HI>Colossus of the Sun,</HI> one of the seuen wonders of the world, was vulgarly said to haue beene erected. This, we read, was made by <HI>Chares Lindius, Lysippus</HI> his scholler, and was at least seuenty cubites high: <HI>Festus</HI> saith, that it was one hundred and fiue foot high. This image, saith <HI>Pliny,</HI> within six and fifty yeeres after, was by an earth-quake ouerthrowen and laid along: notwithstanding, as it lay it was a woonderment to the behol∣ders. Few men were able to fathom the thombe of it: and the fingers of it were greater than many large statues. Those parts of it that were by any casualty broken did gape so wide, that they were like vnto the mouths of hideous caues: within it were huge massie stones of great weight, wherewith he ballaced it when it was first set vp. It was finished in the space of twelue yeeres: and the brasse thereof waighed three hundred talents. There are beside in sundrie other places of this city, an hundred less r colosses, yet wheresoeuer any of them were, they did much grace the place. In another place the same authour writeth that, that there were in it aboue three thousand statues. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that this <HI>Colossus,</HI> in his time, was by an earth-quake ouerthrowne and lay along, and was broken off at the knees: after which time the Rhodians were by the oracle of <HI>Apollo,</HI> forbidden to set it vp againe. Of this Earth-quake read <HI>Polybius</HI> in his fifth booke. <HI>The aire is neuer so thicke and cloudy, nor the heauen euer so closely maskt,</HI> saith Solinus Polyhistor, <HI>but the sunne doth shine in Rhodes.</HI> Whereupon Manilius writeth thus of it, <HI>Tuquè verè domus Solis, cui tota sacrataes.</HI> And thou who truly sacredart, and princely court of glorious Sunne. <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> do commend the <HI>Wines</HI> and <HI>Figges</HI> of <HI>Rhodes</HI> aboue those of other countries. <HI>Phylostratus</HI> in his second booke of Images affirmeth, that the soile of this ile is very good and fertile of <HI>Grapes</HI> and <HI>Figges. Eusebius</HI> writeth that the inhabitants and people of this ile, alwaies vpon the sixth day of <HI>May,</HI> vsed to sacrifice a man vnto their gods. There are some which boldly affirme, that these people were called <HI>Colossians,</HI> of that famous <HI>Colossus,</HI> before mentioned. Amongst which are <HI>Eustathius, Zonaras</HI> and <HI>Glycas:</HI> as also <HI>Suidas,</HI> but that he calleth them not <HI>Colossenses,</HI> but <HI>Colassenses,</HI> sounding <HI>a,</HI> the first vowell, not <HI>o</HI> the fourth, in the second syllable. Others, of whose opinion I am, do rather thinke, that those are called <HI>Colossenses,</HI> which do inhabite <HI>Colostae,</HI> (now <HI>Chone,</HI> as <HI>Porphyrogennetas</HI> sheweth) a city of <HI>Phry∣gia</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> the lesse, to whom S. <HI>Paul</HI> wrote his Epistle, not to these Rhodians, as we haue shewed in our Treasury. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> and <HI>Polybius</HI> do speake much of Rhodes: but of all men <HI>Strabo</HI> doth describe it best. Of this iland see the third chapter of the seuenth booke of <HI>Aulus Gellius.</HI> It had seuen Arsenals or docks wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re shippes were built and repaired, as I reade in the fift booke of <HI>Polyaenus</HI> in <HI>Heraclides.</HI> Their great store of shipping was a manifest argument of their great strength and power.

It had a city of the same name, which <HI>Thucydides</HI> calleth the greatest and richest of all the cities of <HI>Ionia.</HI> There is nothing in this ile more renowmed, than the wine which they call <HI>Chium vinum,</HI> the best of all Greeke wiues, as <HI>Strabo, Aelianus,</HI> and other good authours affirme. The vines whereof this wine is made do especially grow in the fields of <HI>Aruisius (Amista,</HI> it is now called) about the mount <HI>Pelmaeus.</HI> whereupon this wine was since called <HI>Vinum aruisium,</HI> and by addition of one letter <HI>Maruisium,</HI> of which later we do commonly call it <HI>Malmesy. Athenaeus</HI> sheweth, that <HI>vinum nigrum,</HI> the red wine or blacke wine, was first knowne in this ile. It is no lesse famous for the Lentiske tree which yeeldeth <HI>Ma∣sticke,</HI> that sweet and wholesome gumme. The marble also of this ile is much commended by <HI>Pliny:</HI> who thinketh, that the quarries of <HI>Chios</HI> did first shew vnto the world that marble of diuers colours, which they vse in building of wals. <HI>Vitruuius</HI> describeth a fountaine in this ile, of whose waters if any man shall drinke vna∣wares they presently become starke fooles, bererued of all vnderstanding and reason.

This ile is consecrate and sacred to <HI>Vulcan:</HI> for olde fables do tell, that, being by <HI>Iupiter</HI> throwen headlong out of heauen, he light in this ile. <HI>Tzetzes</HI> out of <HI>Hellanicus</HI> affirmeth, that fire was first found in this iland, as also that armour and warlike weapons were first deuised and made here. Of those foure <HI>Labyrinths,</HI> fa∣mous all the world ouer, and reckoned vp by <HI>Pliny,</HI> the third was in this countrey. The surueyers and architects of this worke were <HI>Zmilus</HI> and <HI>Rholus,</HI> together with <HI>Theodorus,</HI> this countrey-man borne.

It is an iland fertile and rich of all maner of commodities, wine only except, which here is none of the best, nor in any great quantity: whereupon they do vse to say in a common by-word, That in this iland their hennes giue milke. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> writeth, that here Figs, Grapes, Peares, Apples, and Roses do ripen twise a yeere: yet we finde recorded in <HI>Aelianus,</HI> and <HI>Heraclides</HI> in his Politicks, affirme that it was sometime a forest, full of woods, and wild beasts. <HI>Pliny</HI> doth speake of <HI>Lapis-Samius</HI> &amp; <HI>Terra Samia,</HI> a certaine stone and kind of earth only found in this iland, and doth highly commend their souereigne vertue and physicall vse. Item, he saith that the Samian dishes were of great request at princes tables.

<HEAD>DELOS, and RHENIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DELOS</HI> is situate amongst the Cyclades. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, that this ile was farre and neere knowen and talked of by reason of the <HI>Temple of Apollo</HI> and the <HI>great market</HI> or faire ordinarily kept there. <HI>Pausanias</HI> calleth it, <HI>The Mart of all Greece; Festus, The greatest mart of all the world; Thucydides</HI> termeth it, <HI>The Exchequer of Greece;</HI> another nameth it, <HI>The natiue soile of the gods:</HI> for the fabulous tales of Poets haue made the world beleeue that <HI>Diana</HI> and <HI>Apol∣lo</HI> were borne here. Of which conceit and opinion of men, it rose, as <HI>Tully</HI> against <HI>Verres</HI> writeth, that this iland was held to be consecrated vnto them: and such the authority of holinesse and religion of it both is and alwaies hath beene, that the Persians making warre vpon <HI>Greece,</HI> in defiance both of God &amp; man, and landing at <HI>De∣los</HI> with a thousand ships, they neuer once offered to profane or once to touch any thing here. Immediatly after the first deluge or floud in the time of <HI>Ogygius,</HI> this iland, as we find recorded by <HI>Solinus,</HI> before all other lands &amp; countries whatsoeuer, receiued the lusture of the sun-beames, &amp; thereupon it obteined that name of <HI>DELOS,</HI> that is, <HI>Apparent,</HI> or <HI>easily &amp; soone descried.</HI> It had also other names giuen to it of other accidents and euents that fall out in the same: as namely, <HI>PELASGIA, LAGIA, ORTYGIA, CYNETHVM, CYNTHON, CHLAMIDIA, SCYTHIA, ANAPHE, ASTERIA,</HI> &amp;c. (But <HI>Asteria</HI> was the name of a citie in this ile, which citie was afterward, as <HI>Apollodorus</HI> and <HI>Seruius</HI> do testifie, called also <HI>Delos.) Pliny</HI> nameth it <HI>ARTEMITA</HI> and <HI>CELADVSSA. A∣thenaeus</HI> noteth three things here worthy of speciall obseruation; A market wonderfully furnished with all maner of victuall and dainty dishes; The great multitudes of all maner of people dwelling in it; and The infinite number of parasites, smell-feasts or trencher-chaplaines belonging to this god. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth of the fountaine or head of the riuer <HI>Inopus,</HI> that altogether in the same maner, and at the same time it doth ebbe and flowe with <HI>Nilus</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> so that the people doe verily beleeue, that it commeth by secret passages vnder the sea from the <HI>Nilus</HI> vnto them. The same authour maketh mention of certeine rocks of <HI>Delos (petrae Deli)</HI> where he saith, the fishes by nature are so salt, that one would deeme them to haue beene layd in pickle, and may well be accounted for salt-fish, and yet in the hauen of the same they are fresh. In old time the copper of <HI>Delos</HI> was held for the best, as we reade in the same authour. In his time, he affirmeth, there was a palme-tree still to be seene, that had stood there euer since <HI>Apollo</HI> was borne. <HI>Pausanias</HI> (who liued in the reigne of <HI>Hadrian</HI> the Emperour) writeth, that in his time this iland was so desert and dis∣peopled, that the gard of the Temple which the Athenians sent thither being remoued, if one should reckon only the Delians, was wholly waste and void of inhabitants: It is wonderfull to see how time doth alter the state of all things.

Therefore the corpses of dead men were from thence conueyed into the next ile called <HI>RHENIA,</HI> which is a very small iland, waste and wholly desert, distant from hence not aboue foure furlongs. <HI>Plutarch</HI> sayth that <HI>Nicias</HI> made a bridge from one to the other. <HI>Thucydides</HI> in his <HI>1</HI> and <HI>3</HI> booke writeth, that it was taken by <HI>Polycrates</HI> the tyrant of <HI>Samus,</HI> annexed by a great long chaine to <HI>Delos,</HI> and consecrated to <HI>Apollo Delius.

Moreouer, they say, that in the confines of <HI>Gnosia, (Cinosa)</HI> neere the riuer <HI>Therene,</HI> the manage of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> with <HI>Iuno</HI> was celebrated and kept. The history of <HI>Minoes</HI> the Law-giuer: and <HI>Radamanthus,</HI> the seuere Iusticier, hath made it more talked of, than any other ile in this ocean. That it is very full of mountaines and woods, and hath also diuers fertile valleies and champion plaines, <HI>Strabo</HI> doth sufficiently witnesse. <HI>Solinus</HI> maketh it to be a country well stored with wild goates. <HI>Item,</HI> he sheweth that the sheep, especially about <HI>Gurtyna</HI>) are red and foure horn'd. <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth it, The natiue soile of the Cypresse tree: for which way soeuer any man shall goe, or wheresoeuer he shall offer to set his foote, especially about mount <HI>Ida (Psiloriti)</HI> and those which they call, The white hils, except the soile be planted with other trees, this tree sprowth vp, and that not only in any peculiar or made ground, but euery where of it owne accord naturally. <HI>Cornelius Celsus</HI> speaketh of <HI>Aristolochia Cretica.</HI> That there is heere no Owle, or any mischieuous and harmefull creature, beside the <HI>Phalangium,</HI> a kind of perillous Spider, <HI>Plutarch, Pl ny, Solinus, AElianus</HI> and <HI>Antigonius</HI> do iointly testifie. <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> in his 30. booke, doth commend the dogges or hounds of this iland for excellent hunters.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F those seuen ilands of the Midlandsea, more famous and memorable than the rest for their greatnesse, some there are, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> writeth which make this the third. They which describe countries by their formes and proportions, do liken this to the print of a mans foot: whereupon it was sometime named ICH∣NVSA and SANDALIOTIS: of the Greekes it was called, of <HI>Sardon, Hercules</HI> his sonne, SARDON; of the Latines, SARDINIA. This, by the testimonie of <HI>Pausanias</HI> in his <HI>Phocica,</HI> may be compared to those iles which, either for greatnesse or goodnesse of soile, are most highlie commended. <HI>Polybius</HI> saith, That for greatnesse, multitude of men, and all manner of excellent fruites, it beareth the bell from other ilands in this sea. <HI>AElianus</HI> calleth it, The best nurce for cattell: <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh it, The best soile for corne, where∣upon <HI>Florus</HI> termeth it, <HI>Annonae pignus,</HI> a pawne for all maner of prouision. <HI>Prudentius</HI> writeth, That a nauie, which should bring ouer into <HI>Italy</HI> the store of graine in <HI>Sardinia,</HI> would burst all the barnes of <HI>Rome. Saluianus</HI> nameth this iland, <HI>Vitalem vrbis Romae venam,</HI> the vitall artery, or veine wherein the life bloud of the citie of <HI>Rome</HI> doth consist. <HI>Sidonius in Pane∣gyrico Maiorani,</HI> saith that it is very fertile of siluer. It is an iland verie rich and fertile of siluer, as <HI>Pomponius</HI> writeth: <HI>Item,</HI> hee writeth that the soile is much better than the aire: and as it is verie fruitfull, so is it for the most part pestilent and vnwholesome: the which <HI>Strabo</HI> also confirmeth, where he saith, That in sommer time it is verie dangerous for sickenesses, especially in those places where it is most fertile. To these discommodities, the hearb <HI>Sardonia,</HI> also may be adioined, which, as <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> in the foureteenth chapter of his sixth booke, writeth, that if it be eaten troubleth the braine, taketh away a mans memorie, maketh him yawne, and so to die as if he laughed. There is also the <HI>Solifuga,</HI> (as <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth it, or <HI>Solipungia,</HI> as <HI>Festus</HI>) a little creature, much like to the Spider, vpon which, whosoeuer shall chance to sit, he lightlie shalbe dangerouslie hurt. The <HI>Musmo,</HI> a beast like to a ramme, which <HI>Pliny</HI> saith is proper to <HI>Corsica, Strabo</HI> attributeth to this ile: to whom also <HI>AElianus</HI> in the foure and thirtith chapter of his sixteenth booke <HI>De Animalibus,</HI> doth seeme to giue his voice. <HI>Suidas</HI> saith that heere are bred the best and finest purples. <HI>Nonnius Marcellus,</HI> by the authority of <HI>Varro,</HI> in his booke <HI>De genere vestimentorum,</HI> commendeth the Sar∣dinian tapestrie (except there be a fault in the copie, and for <HI>Sardineae,</HI> it should be written <HI>Sardianis,</HI> of <HI>Sardis</HI> the citie of <HI>Asia:</HI> which I do rather thinke to be true and more probable: for of the Sardian tapestrie we maie read in <HI>Athenaeus</HI> and others.) <HI>Claudianus</HI> in the later end of his treatise <HI>De bello Gildonico,</HI> doth most finely describe <HI>Calaris, (Calari,</HI> or <HI>Caglire</HI>) the chiefe city of the same. <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh the depth of the sea heere to be M. elles. Other things proper to this ile you maie see in <HI>Pausani∣as, Solinus, Eustathius, Claudian</HI> and others.

This iland grew to such great strength and power, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> writeth, that it sub∣dued many other ilands and cities, and brought them vnder their command: <HI>Item,</HI> that it was so strong in ship∣ping, that it alone, in the Persian warre, did set out and furnish threescore shippes. Yet afterward it was brought to that deso∣lation, that of it became this prouerbe, <HI>Cercyra est libera, caca vbi volueris;</HI> Corfu is emptie now, you may vntrusse where you list. There is another <HI>Corcyra,</HI> different from this, in the Hadriaticke sea, named otherwise <HI>Melaena.</HI></P>
<P>CEPHALENIA, otherwise called MELAENA, SAMOS and TAPHOS: as also DVLICHIVM, as some men haue written, by the testimony of <HI>Strabo. Eustathius</HI> and <HI>Tzetzes</HI> haue written that it was sometime inhabited of foure sundrie nations; namely, of the <HI>Pronij, Samij, Palenses</HI> and the <HI>Cranij:</HI> to these <HI>Liuy</HI> addeth the <HI>Nesiotae.</HI> In this iland, if one may trust <HI>Aelianus,</HI> the Goates drinke not for the space of six moneths together. Looke in the discourse of <HI>Zacynthus</HI> following. In <HI>Antigonus</HI> we read, that a cer∣taine riuer runneth through the middest of it, vpon the one side of which there are great store of grasse-hoppers, and on the other side not one.</P>
<P>ZACYNTHVS, (now <HI>Zante,</HI> and as <HI>Erythraeus</HI> saith, somtime <HI>Hierusalem</HI>) HYRIA it was in old time called, and CASSIOPA, the poet nameth it <HI>Nemorosa,</HI> woody. These ilanders, <HI>Athenaeus</HI> saith, are no good souldiers; the reason he yeeldeth to be, for that they be very wealthy, and haue such plenty of all things, that they giue themselues to nought else but to their ease and plea∣sure. The <HI>Phalangium,</HI> a kind of spider, is heere more dangerous and hurtfull to mankind, than in any place of the world beside, as <HI>AElianus</HI> saith. So long as the <HI>Etesiae,</HI> (East windes which rise ordinarily in the dogge daies) blow, the Goates stand yaw∣ning and gaping with their noses vp into the North: and are so satisfied therewith, that they looke after no water nor euer care for drinke, as <HI>Antigonus</HI> hath left recorded.

HAVE; God be with thee good <HI>Cicero:</HI> which he saith was in the yeare 1544. <HI>Adamus Tefellenius Louaniensis</HI> in his Iournall (a manuscript copy of which M. <HI>Hadrian Marselar,</HI> lent me to read ouer) writeth, that he in this iland in the yeare of Christ 1550. handled the bones of <HI>Cicero,</HI> and read vpon his tombe this epitaph: <HI>Ille oratorum princeps, &amp; gloria linguae Romanae, iacet hac, cum coniuge Tullius, vrna: Tullius ille, inquam, de se, qui scripserat olim, O fortunatam natam me consule Romam.</HI> The learned <HI>Tully,</HI> who for fined tongue, in <HI>Rome</HI> had neuer peere, With louing wife, in clay full low, lie both enterred heere: That <HI>Tully</HI> great, I meane, who of himselfe, sometime thus proudlie said: Now <HI>Rome,</HI> thou blessed art indeed, since I thy scepter swaied.</P>
<P>ITHACA, which was also in old time called NERITIA, of <HI>Neritus</HI> a mountaine, if I be not deceiued, is now vulgarly of the Italians called <HI>Valle di Compare,</HI> and as <HI>Porcaccius</HI> saith, <HI>Teachi:</HI> of the Turkes, as the learned <HI>Lewnclawe</HI> writeth, <HI>Phiachi.</HI> More∣ouer in the 10. booke of <HI>Straboes</HI> Geography, I find that there is heere a city called <HI>Ithaca,</HI> which <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his Greeke Que∣stions nameth, <HI>Alalcome,</HI> but <HI>Stephanus, Alcomenae. Athenaeus</HI> writeth, that it hath many hauens, but withall is very mountai∣nous, rough and craggie: so that it will not easily, without great and infinite labour and toile, yeeld any small or meane profit, vnto the husbandmen, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> telleth vs. In <HI>Porphyry,</HI> out of the writings of <HI>Artimedorus,</HI> I read that this iland, from <HI>Pa∣normus,</HI> an hauen of <HI>Cephalina,</HI> lieth Eastward, and conteineth in compasse 85. furlongs. It is very narrow, but high. In it is, as the same authour, with <HI>Homer</HI> doth witnesse, a caue of the Nymphs. We read in <HI>Antigonius,</HI> that it breedeth no Hares at all. Except it had been the natiue soile, and country where <HI>Vlysses</HI> was borne, there had no mention at all of it remained in a∣ny recordes of ancient writers.</P>
<P>LEVCAS or LEVCADIA (now <HI>S. Maura</HI>) although <HI>Pliny</HI> maketh it but a <HI>peninsula</HI> or demy-ile, yet <HI>Mela</HI> calleth it flatly an iland. That it was made an iland and was seuered from the maine continent, yet afterward by force and violence of windes ioined to the same againe, <HI>Strabo</HI> doth teach vs. In a very high foreland or promontory of this ile, <HI>AElianus</HI> describeth the temple of <HI>Apollo Aelius,</HI> from whence yearely they were wont to tumble some one or other downe into the sea headlong, thereby to ap∣pease the wrath and fury of their Gods; as <HI>Strabo</HI> hath left recorded.</P>
<P>ECHINADES, (<HI>Echidnae, Seneca</HI> in his <HI>Troas,</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> in <HI>Iphegenia</HI> in <HI>Aulide,</HI> call them: but <HI>Stephanus, Echinae</HI>) so named of the great multitude of the <HI>Echini,</HI> Vrchines or Hedge-hogges, which do greatly infect this iland. <HI>Apollodorus</HI> calleth them, STROPHADES; now they are knowen by the name of the <HI>Cozzulari:</HI> they are, as <HI>Ouid</HI> in the 8. booke of his <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> wri∣teth, in number 5. these were also part of the continent, as <HI>Pausanias</HI> in his <HI>Arcadia,</HI> testifieth; their forme and fashion is often altered and changed by the ebbing and flowing (if I may so speake) of the mudde of the riuer <HI>Achelous (Aspri</HI> or <HI>Pachicolamo</HI>) at whose mouth they stand, as <HI>Strabo</HI> would faine perswade vs. Neere these are the <HI>Taphiae</HI> and <HI>Acutae,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Thoae. Plutarch</HI> in his treatise of the ceassing of oracles, telleth a story (or fable, rather) worth the reading, of the death of <HI>Pan,</HI> which tell out about these ilands.</P>

<HEAD>AFRICA PROPRIA, AFRICA properly so called.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S that part of <HI>Asia</HI> which is inclosed with <HI>Mar Maiore, Archipelago, Midland sea,</HI> and the riuer <HI>Euphrates,</HI> is of the Geographers properly called <HI>Asia:</HI> so this part of <HI>Africa,</HI> aboue all other prouinces of the same, hath alwayes hither∣to beene knowen by the name of <HI>AFRICA PROPRIA.</HI> This also is worth the obseruation, that in all ancient stories, when <HI>Asia</HI> or <HI>Africa</HI> are generally or indefinitly named, these seuerall prouinces of those greater parts, are only to be vnderstood. The bounds of this prouince of <HI>Africa</HI> on the West are the riuer <HI>Ampsaga,</HI> and the Mauritania's, the coun∣tries of the Moores, their next neighbours: on the North, lieth the Midland sea: <HI>Arae Philenorum,</HI> a village betweene it and <HI>Cyrenaica,</HI> is the vttermost bound of it Eastward: the <HI>Inner Libya</HI> and the deserts of the same do confine it vpon the South. This countrey was otherwise sometime called <HI>ZEVGIS</HI> and <HI>ZEVGITANA.</HI> It comprehendeth with∣in this compasse these three shires, <HI>NVMIDIA</HI> (named of some <HI>MASSYLIA) BYZACIVM</HI> and <HI>TRIPOLI∣TANA. Diodorus Siculus</HI> diuideth this prouince into foure nations, the <HI>Poeni, Libophoenices, Libyi,</HI> and the <HI>Nu∣midae.</HI> At such time as the Romans bore a sway here, and <HI>Scipio Aemilianus</HI> commanded their legions in these parts, this <HI>Africa</HI> was diuided into two prouinces: that neere <HI>Carthage,</HI> they called <HI>OLDE AFRICA:</HI> that which conteined <HI>Numidia, NEW AFRI∣CA,</HI> as <HI>Pliny, Appian</HI> and <HI>Dion</HI> do ioyntly testifie. <HI>Numidia,</HI> and <HI>Byzacium,</HI> were vnder the command of the Consuls; that wherein <HI>Carthage</HI> stood, belonged to the iurisdiction of the Proconsuls, as <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> reporteth. (And this diuision they made, as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, by a certaine ditch drawen betweene them.) In the first booke of <HI>Iustinians Code,</HI> and in the seuen and twentieh title of the same, thou shalt finde another maner of diuision of this countrey, and a farre other maner of gouernment of it by Presidents and Lieutenants. <HI>Numidia,</HI> beside the great store of Marble there found, called by the name of Numidian marble, and the maruellous plenty of Deere and wilde beasts which it yeeldeth, hath nothing worth the remembrance, as <HI>Pliny</HI> affirmeth. <HI>Liuy, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Solinus</HI> do giue it the praise for the best horsmen for seruice in the warres, of any countrey whatsoeuer. They doe as highly commend the fat soile of <HI>Byzacium;</HI> which is such that it yeeldeth an hundred for one: yea, it hath beene knowen, that one bushell of wheat being sowen, hath yeelded at haruest the increase of an hundred and fifty bushels againe. The Lieutenant of this place sent from thence vnto <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> forty eares of corne sprung and growen vp from one root, and one graine, as was probable. Item there were sent likewise to <HI>Nero</HI> from thence three hundred and forty stalks with eares of corne come vp of one and the some graine. To this also may be adioyned the goodnesse of the soile, which is such, as <HI>Columella</HI> reporteth of it, that the husbandman, after he hath layd his seed in the ground, from seed-time to haruest, neuer looketh to his fields, nor once medleth with it more, for that searse any weed or other such thing, which vsually hindereth the growth of corne, doth here come vp of it owne accord, except it be either set or sowen by hand. <HI>Halicarnasseus</HI> also maketh mention of this great fertility of <HI>Africa.</HI> But <HI>Titus</HI> the Emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI> in one word, doth sufficiently declare the woonderfully fruitfulnesse and plenty of all things here, in an Oration of his written vnto the seditious and mutinous Iewes, where he nameth it, <HI>Altricem orbis terrarum,</HI> The nourse of all nations of the world. Yea and <HI>Saluianus</HI> in his seuenth booke ter∣meth it, <HI>Animam Reipublicae Romanae,</HI> The soule of the Romane Common-wealth, or politicke body there; where thou mayst reade many other things worth the obseruation, of the riches, command and power of this countrey. <HI>Herodian</HI> maketh it a country very fertile of men. <HI>Polybius</HI> on the other side doth as much commend it for the great abundance of cattell and all sorts of liuing creatures that it breedeth. So that for multitude of Horses, Oxen, Sheepe, and Goats, it doth farre surpasse almost all the rest of the world beside. And that which is most woonderfull of all other, it is no strange thing here (as <HI>Columella,</HI> out of <HI>Dionysius, Mago,</HI> and <HI>Marcus Varro,</HI> telleth vs) to see Mules to breed, and bring forth yoong: so that the inhabitants do as oft see the foales of Mules there, as we do of Mares here. The same authour in the first chapter of his fourth booke sayth that the people are very ingenious and witty. <HI>Hirtius</HI> calleth it, <HI>Gentem insidiosam,</HI> A treacherous nation: <HI>Maternus</HI> nameth it, <HI>Gentem subdolam,</HI> A wily and crafty people: so that <HI>Vlgetius</HI> doubted not to say, That for wiles and wealth the Romans were alwayes inferiour to the Africans. <HI>Iuuenal</HI> the Poet termeth it, <HI>Causidi∣corum nut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iculam,</HI> The nurse of prating petifoggers. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> recounteth the Carthaginians amongst those nations which delight much in quassing and carowsing, and vse to be often drunke. <HI>Saluianus</HI> in his seuenth booke <HI>De Prouidentia,</HI> sayth that they are generally so inhumane, such drunkards, so deceitfull, fraudulent, couetous, treacherous, disloyall, leud, lecherous, and vnchaste, that he that is not such an one, he surely is no Africane. Lastly, there is, as he there addeth, no maner of wickednesse or villany that they are not giuen vnto. All histories do make mention of the vnfaithfulnesse and false-heartednesse of this nation: which indeed is such, and they for the same so greatly noted and famous, that they grew for it into a common by-word among all such nations as had any conuersation or ought to do with them. And thus much of this <HI>Africa,</HI> a land, as the Poets terme it, most rich for triumphs; the fortresse or castle, as <HI>Cicero</HI> calleth it, of all Prouinces belonging to the Romane Empire. The Ilands neere adioyning and belonging to this country, more famous and of better note, are, <HI>Melita, Menyx, Cosura</HI> and <HI>Cercina;</HI> beside some other lesser ones, and of lesse account: of which, as also the people, ri∣uers, mountaines, townes, and cities, see this our Table. That <HI>Sardinia,</HI> that goodly iland which lieth ouer against <HI>Genua,</HI> did sometime belong to this <HI>Africa, Iustinian</HI> doth testifie in the seuen and twentieth Title of the first booke of his Code. But of <HI>CARTHAGE,</HI> the chiefe and metropolitane citie of this prouince, although <HI>Salust</HI> sayth it is better farre to say nothing at all of it, than to speake little: yet notwithstanding I thinke it not amisse to adde somewhat of that also in this place. This city of the Latines was called <HI>CARTHAGO,</HI> of the Greeks <HI>CHARCHEDON. Solinus Polyhistor</HI> repor∣teth that it was first called <HI>CARTHADA,</HI> which word, sayth he, in the Phoenician tongue, (of neere affinity to the Hebrew and Arabicke) signifieth <HI>Ciuitatem nouam,</HI> The new city. And indeed, truth it is, that <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> in the Arabicke dialect, and <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Kariat hadátha,</HI> in the Syrian doth signifie, <HI>A new city,</HI> or <HI>castle.</HI> Hereupon it is that <HI>Stephanus</HI> nameth it <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>NOVAM VRBEM,</HI> The new city. He moreouer calleth it <HI>OENVSSA, CACABE,</HI> and <HI>CADMEIA,</HI> but vpon what ground and authority I know not. <HI>Cadmeia,</HI> peraduenture, it was named of the Hebrew <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which in that language (as also in the rest of the orientall tongues deriued from hence) signifieth, <HI>the East;</HI> or, <HI>first</HI> and <HI>chiefest:</HI> both which may well agree to this city: for the first inhabitants, who built it, and enclosed it with an huge wall and ditch, were Easterlings, <HI>Cadmonim,</HI> or such as came thither from <HI>Kedem,</HI> the East. Againe, in respect of the greatnesse, power, goodly beauty and lusture of it, it might iustly (and indeed so it did, as we shall shew in that which followeth) deserue the name of <HI>Cadmia,</HI> that is, the chiefe and principall metropolitane city: and it may be that for the same reason it was also of them called <HI>Cacabe, Stellaris,</HI> the glistring starre; of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Caucabi,</HI> a starre: answerable to <HI>Asteria,</HI> or <HI>Asteris,</HI> an iland in the Midlandsea: <HI>Asterius</HI> the name of a place in the ile <HI>Tenedos: Astron,</HI> or <HI>Astrum,</HI> a riuer of <HI>Troas,</HI> issuing out of the mount <HI>Ida,</HI> as <HI>Pli∣ny</HI> testifieth: Item, a great and goodly city of <HI>Argia</HI> in <HI>Peloponnesus:</HI> with diuers other places in <HI>Greekland,</HI> of the like denomination; all deriued from <HI>Aster,</HI> and <HI>Astrum,</HI> which in the Greeke tongue signifie A starre. There are many learned men, which do thinke, that in the Holy Scripture this ci∣ty is called and described by the name of <HI>THARSIS.</HI> And thus much of the ancient names and appellations of this city: for in succedent ages it hath beene called also by diuers others beside these, as we shall shew hereafter. Yea and ancient writers haue graced it with diuers honorable titles and epithites: calling it <HI>Celsam</HI> and <HI>Almam,</HI> The Stately and Honourable city <HI>Carthage: Apuleius</HI> nameth it, <HI>Romani imperij aemulam, terrarum orbis aui∣dam; Prouinciae magistram venerabilem; Africae Musam coelestem; Camaenam togatorum;</HI> The great enuier of the Romane state, and yet it selfe desiring all the souereignty of the world; The honourable mistresse of the Prouince; The heauenly Muse of <HI>Africa;</HI> The delight and paradise of the gentry of the land. Of <HI>Solinus</HI> it is intituled, <HI>Alterum post vrbem Romam terrarum decus:</HI> Next after the goodly city of <HI>Rome</HI> the only glory of the world. Of <HI>Ptolemey, Manilius</HI> &amp; <HI>Pliny</HI> it is called <HI>Magna,</HI> The great city. Of <HI>Victor Vticensis</HI> &amp; <HI>Suidas, Maxima orbis terrarum,</HI> The greatest city of the whole world. And that not without iust cause: for <HI>Orosius</HI> testifieth that it was twenty miles about within the walles, almost round enclosed with the sea. The abridgement of <HI>Liuy</HI> sayth that it was foure and twenty miles about. <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh it in compasse three hundred and threescore f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rlongs <HI>(stadia)</HI> which do make fiue and forty Italian miles. How true this is I leaue to the discretion of the learned Reader to determine: This city was situate in a <HI>peninsula,</HI> or demy-ile, ioyned to the continent of <HI>Africa,</HI> by a neckland (<HI>Isthmos</HI> the Greeks call it) of three miles bredth, or as <HI>Appian,</HI> the dilig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Chorographer of this place reporteth, <HI>25</HI> furlongs ouer. <HI>Siluis Italicus</HI> thus writeth of it, <HI>Haec caput est, non vlla opibus certauerit auri, Non portu, celsouè situ, non dotibus auri, Vberis, aut agili fabricanda ad tela vigore.</HI> The more famous places in it are <HI>Megara,</HI> a part of the city so called. <HI>Byrsa,</HI> the castle, which conteined in circuit, as <HI>Scruius</HI> hath noted, two and twenty furlongs; (in this stood the temples of <HI>Iuno, Aescu∣lapius</HI> and <HI>Belus:</HI>) The <HI>Theater, Thermae Gargilianae,</HI> and <HI>Thermae Maximianae,</HI> certeine hot bathes: The <HI>Delphicum,</HI> or temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> the chapal dedicated to the goddesse <HI>Memoria,</HI> the Horse-race <HI>(Hippodromus) Basilica Celerinae,</HI> the church of <HI>Theoprepia, Lypsana</HI> a certeine place so called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Via coelestis,</HI> Heauen walke; except the copy in this place be faulty and corrupt.

<PB REF="307"/> <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperour of <HI>Rome</HI> builded here and repaired, <HI>Procopius</HI> in his sixth booke of the buildings of this Emperour, relateth at large. Of him also if we may giue credit to <HI>Balsamon,</HI> it was called <HI>IVSTINIANA.</HI> The builders of this city, which layd the first foundations of it, were the Phoeni∣cians <HI>Xorus</HI> and <HI>Carchedon,</HI> or, as some other report, <HI>Elissa</HI> or <HI>Dido,</HI> King <HI>Agenors</HI> daughter, fifty yeeres before the ouerthrow of <HI>Troy:</HI> or three score and twelue yeeres before the building of the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>Appianus</HI> affirmeth. <HI>Siluis Italicus</HI> sayth that <HI>Teucer</HI> was the first that began the foundation of this city. It was built, as <HI>Iosephus</HI> in his disputation against <HI>Appion</HI> writeth, in the hundred and fiue and fifty yeere after the death of <HI>So∣lomon,</HI> the glorious king of <HI>Israel.</HI> The valour and great strength of this city, as it was alwayes eminent and famous in forren warres abroad, so hath beene often shaken and ouermastered many &amp; sundry times at home. At length hauing stood in flourishing estate, as most authours affirme, seuen hundred and seuen and thirty yeeres, it was by the Romans, as an enuious enemy of their state and empire, assaulted, battered, taken, sacked, vtterly spoiled, and at last consumed to dust and ashes. And thus it continued for the space of one hundred and one yeeres: when by the commandement and prescript of the Se∣nate it was againe reedified, who, sending thither certeine people to inhabit and dwell there, made it a Romane colony: and this was the first colony of the Romans that euer was transported foorth of <HI>Italy.</HI> It was of <HI>Cayus Gracchus</HI> called <HI>IVNONIA,</HI> as it is recorded by <HI>Appian, Solinus,</HI> and <HI>Dion;</HI> who also addeth that it was afterward by <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> againe the second time made a Colony: because that when <HI>Lepidus</HI> had wasted a great part of it, and left it destitute and without inhabitants, he in maner seemed to haue dissolued the right and priuiledge of the Colony. Therefore this city began againe to flourish, and vnder the Romane Emperours, to be renowmed vnder the name of <HI>The second Carthage.</HI> So that that city which lately was re∣nowmed for seats of armes and martiall prowes, was now, as <HI>Martianus</HI> writeth, as honourable for worldly felicity and all maner of earthly blessings. It tasted also of the beneuolence and bounteous magnificence of the Emperour <HI>Hadrian,</HI> and thereupon it was of him called <HI>HADRIANOPOLIS,</HI> that is, <HI>Hadrians city,</HI> as <HI>Spartianus</HI> hath left recorded. Item, the Romane Emperour <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> did much grace it with many sumptuous and stately buildings as you may reade in <HI>Pausanias. Lampridius</HI> writeth, that in respect of the fauourable kindnesse of the Emperour <HI>Commodus</HI> toward this ci∣ty, it was in like maner of him named <HI>ALEXANDRIA COMMODIANA TOGATA.</HI> But, (as the state of all things vnder the cope of heauen is vnconstant and variable) the same city vnder <HI>Gordianus</HI> the Emperour, was, as <HI>Herodian</HI> testifieth, by one <HI>Capellianus</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Mauritania</HI> taken the second time, and spoiled, about six hundred and foure score yeeres after it first had submitted it selfe to the command and iurisdiction of the Ro∣mans. In the reigne of <HI>Honorius</HI> the Emperour it was by treachery the third time taken, sacked, and vtterly defaced, by <HI>Genserichus</HI> king of the Wan∣dals, in the foure hundred and thirty yeere after the incarnation of <HI>CHRIST</HI> our Sauiour. The like it suffered of certeine mutinous souldiers vnder one <HI>Salomon</HI> a lieutenant of the <HI>Maurusij,</HI> or <HI>Barbary,</HI> as <HI>Procopius</HI> hath recorded. From these it was woon by <HI>Belisarius,</HI> in the yeere of <HI>CHRIST</HI> fiue hundred thirty eight, in the time of <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Romane Emperour, who caused it to be repaired, and fortified with a strong wall and deepe ditch; who moreouer beautified it with many goodly publike buildings, of most curious architecture, as Cloisters, Galleries, the Theodorian Bathes, the gorgeous Church of our Lady, the chiefe Saint, and others which are reckoned vp by the same <HI>Procopius.</HI> After this it continued vnder the Romans vntill the time of <HI>Heraclius</HI> the Emperour, when as it was conquered and surprised by the Persians, about the yeere of <HI>CHRIST</HI> six hundred and sixteene. It was taken, sacked, and spoiled by the Egyptians, three score and six yeeres after that, as <HI>Procopius</HI> and others do constantly witnesse. Neither was this the last misery of this city: for it being spoiled, rased almost to the ground, layed waste, and left dispeopled and void of inhabitants, by the Mahumetanes; so continued vnto the dayes of one <HI>Elmahdi</HI> a Bishop, who, as <HI>Iohannes Leo Africanus</HI> reporteth, gaue it vnto certeine people of that countrey, which were in number so few, that they did not replenish aboue the twentieth part of it. The same authour, an eye witnesse of that which he wrote, affirmeth that of all this greatnesse and glory, beside certeine ruines of the walles and a part of the Conduit, there remaineth at thus day not any whit or mention at all. This now in these our dayes is the fate and forme of this most goodly city. This is that city, which, as <HI>Herodian</HI> testifieth, in time past for wealth, mul∣titude of people, and greatnesse of circuit, did only yeeld it selfe inferiour to <HI>Rome;</HI> and with <HI>Alexandria</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> long contended for the second place. Item, this is it which long since was of that power that it commanded all the sea coast of <HI>Africa</HI> from <HI>Arae Philenorum,</HI> all along as far as to the Straights of <HI>Gibraltar:</HI> ouer which they passing by ship, conquered all <HI>Spaine,</HI> euen vp as high as the Pyreny mountaines. So that <HI>Appian,</HI> a graue writer, doth deeme the Empire and command of this city, of equall value to the power of the far-commanding Greeks, or wealth &amp; riches of the braue Persian: which were an easie matter for one to iustify out of <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> two authours of good credit. For this man affirmeth, that this city commanded in <HI>Africa</HI> alone three hundred cities; and it selfe conteined seuenty thousand men, dayly inhabitants within the walles of the same. Item, <HI>Scipio</HI> hauing conque∣red this city, transported from thence vnto <HI>Rome</HI> foure hundred and seuenty thousand pound weight of siluer. Of this city, (which, as long as it stood out, and was master of it selfe, as <HI>Trogus</HI> witnesseth, was esteemed as a goddesse; and in <HI>Africa,</HI> as <HI>Saluianus</HI> writeth, was accounted as another <HI>Rome</HI>) there remaineth now no more but the bare name onely. Of the nation of the Africans, from whence they came into this country, and what they were, <HI>Pro∣copius,</HI> in the eleuenth booke of his History of the Wandals, hath written somewhat worth the obseruation.</P>
<P>Of Heauen-walke, <HI>(Via coelestis)</HI> which we in a word touched before, I thinke it not amisse here in this place to speake somewhat more at large. In <HI>Victor Vticensis</HI> these words following are read in all copies that euer I saw: <HI>Nam &amp; hodiè si qua supersunt, subinde desolantur, sicut in Carthagi∣neo Theatro aedem Memoriae &amp; viam quam Caelestis vocitabant, funditus deleuerunt.</HI> For <HI>viam,</HI> I make no question but the authour did write <HI>etiam,</HI> that it might be referred to <HI>aedem,</HI> (or <HI>templum,</HI> as <HI>Iulius Capitolinus</HI> in <HI>Pertinax,</HI> doth call it) that is, a chapell, temple or church. Further∣more, of this <HI>Caelestis dea,</HI> Heauenly goddesse, as <HI>Capitolinus</HI> in <HI>Macrinus</HI> and <HI>Trebellius Pollio</HI> in <HI>Celsus tyrannus,</HI> do call her a goddesse peculiar to <HI>Africa,</HI> there are here and there diuers things to be obserued in diuers authours. <HI>Aelianus</HI> writeth that the Egyptians doe call <HI>Venus, Vrania,</HI> that is, Heauenly. <HI>Venus caelestis</HI> (which is all one) is expressed in an ancient piece of coine which I haue of <HI>Iulia Soëmia's. S. Augustine</HI> in his booke <HI>De ci∣uitate Dei</HI> doth speake of the Heauenly Virgine <HI>(Virgo caelestis)</HI> meaning doubtlesse the Heauenly goddesse: but by that epithite, I suppose, he had a purpose to distinguish her from that other; I meane that wanton, which <HI>Iulius Firmicus</HI> calleth <HI>Venerem virginem. Herodian</HI> nameth her <HI>Vrania;</HI> and addeth moreouer, that of the Phoenicians she is called <HI>Astroarche. Alilat, Herodotus</HI> sayth she was named, and affirmeth that it is the Moone. <HI>S. Hierome</HI> in his treatise against <HI>Symmachus</HI> writeth that the Persians call her <HI>Mithra. idque pro diuersitate nominis, non pro numinis varietate;</HI> all these different names signifying, as <HI>S. Ambrose</HI> sayth, one and the same goddesse. <HI>Apuleius</HI> in the sixth booke of his Golden Asse, witnesseth that all the nations of the East countreys do generally call her <HI>Zigia.</HI> There is a notable record of this goddesse, this <HI>Caelestis Venus,</HI> in the eleuenth booke of the same treatise of <HI>Apuleius:</HI> which he there calleth both by the name of <HI>Regina caeli,</HI> The Queene of heauen; and <HI>Syria dea,</HI> the Syrian goddesse. Of whose diuers and manifold forme or shape, the great variety of distinct and different names of the same, if any man be desirous to know more particularly, let him haue recourse to this foresayd authour, as also to Lucians treatise intituled <HI>De Dea Syria;</HI> to which if he shall adioyne certeine coines of the Emperours, <HI>Seuerus</HI> and <HI>Antoninus</HI> his sonne, he shall vnderstand that in this one idoll, almost all the diuinity of the ancient Gentiles is comprehended. <HI>Philastrius,</HI> who wrote of the heresies of former times, sayth that this goddesse was of certeine hereticall Iewes named <HI>Fortuna caeli,</HI> Heauenly fortune. I might easily be drawen to beleeue, that this very goddesse is that idoll which <HI>Ieremy</HI> in the foure and fortieth chapter of his Prophesie, doth terme The Queene of heauen. To whom the wicked Israelites did offer sacrifice, and reuerence as to the immortall God. For it was not hard for this nation, so prone and inclined to idolatry, out of their next neighbour <HI>Hierapolis,</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> (where <HI>Lucian</HI> testifieth this goddesse was most religiously worshipped) to transport this idoll into their countrey <HI>Palaestina,</HI> as the Phoenicians did out of the same <HI>Syria</HI> conuey her beyond the sea to <HI>Carthage:</HI> vnder the conduct and leading, as is probable (and which <HI>Herodotus</HI> iustifieth to be true) of Queene <HI>Dido, Agenors</HI> daughter. Many other things of this goddesse, out of diuers other authours, might heere to these be adioyned: but we at this time are content, with <HI>Plato</HI> to demonstrate that there were two <HI>Venuses:</HI> of which, one, whom the Carthaginians did worship, was this which hitherto we haue spoken of: that same, I meane, which was called <HI>Dea Syria,</HI> or <HI>Venus Assyria,</HI> as <HI>Oppian</HI> in his first booke of Hunting calleth her. This, I do vnderstand out of the sixt booke of <HI>Apuleius,</HI> was the same that <HI>Iuno</HI> was, where he termeth her <HI>Vecturam leonis,</HI> The burden or cariage of the lion: and whom they report, Did loue olde <HI>Carthage</HI> more than all the world beside: for here her charet alwayes stood, her weapons here did lie; as the Poet writeth of her: whereupon I make no question, the city <HI>Carthage</HI> was for the same rea∣son also called <HI>Iunonia:</HI> for so I finde it recorded by <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Solinus.</HI> By her <HI>Charet,</HI> I vnderstand the <HI>Lion,</HI> vpon which she rode: by her <HI>wea∣pons,</HI> the <HI>thunderbolt,</HI> with the other ensignes of the gods and goddesses, which in those forenamed coines are expressed. <HI>Saluianus</HI> in his booke <HI>De Prouidentia,</HI> maketh mention of an Heauenly god <HI>(Deus caelestis)</HI> an idoll also of the Africans. <HI>Vlpianus</HI> in like maner, in the Tit. <HI>qui haeredes institui possunt, § deo haeredis,</HI> speaketh of <HI>Caelestis deus Salinensis Carthaginensis.</HI> But this is nothing to this our goddesse. And peraduenture, we, purposedly speaking of Geography, haue sayd too much of this goddesse.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Egypt</HI> is the gift and fauour of <HI>Nilus:</HI> For antiquity did verily thinke that all that whole tract, which now this countrey doth possesse, was sometime a creeke or bay of the Midland sea; and by the oft ouerflowing and tides of the same, was at length filled vp, and so made firme land. Whereupon perchance it was of <HI>Stephanus</HI> called <HI>POTAMITIS,</HI> that is, if I may so speake, <HI>Brook-land</HI> or <HI>Creek-land.</HI> Item, the same <HI>Stephanus,</HI> with <HI>Dionysius,</HI> calleth it by diuers other names; as, <HI>AERIA, AETIA, OGYGIA, HEPHAESTIA,</HI> and <HI>MELAMBOLOS. Apollodorus</HI> calleth it <HI>The coun∣trey of the MELAMPODES,</HI> for that it is farre more fertile than any other countrey whatsoeuer. Item the fornamed <HI>Stephanus</HI> and <HI>Eustathius</HI> do call it <HI>AETHIOPIA,</HI> by reason of the Aethiopians which do inhabit and dwell there. It was also sometime long since called <HI>THEBAE,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Aristotle</HI> do testifie. In Holy writ, of <HI>Misraim</HI> the second sonne of <HI>Ham,</HI> (Gen. <HI>10.6.</HI>) who first after the confusion at <HI>Babel,</HI> seated himselfe here, it is named <HI>MESRAIM,</HI> as <HI>Io∣sephus</HI> writeth: by which name it is still to this day knowen to the Arabians, their next neighbours round about them. Item, as the learned <HI>Arias Montanus</HI> thinketh, it is in some places called <HI>CVS,</HI> or <HI>Chus,</HI> of <HI>Chus,</HI> father of the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> eldest sonne to the sayd <HI>Ham.</HI> Againe, <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Osiris</HI> writeth, that in the sacred writings of the Aegyptians it was named <HI>CHEMIA,</HI> of <HI>Ham,</HI> or <HI>Cham,</HI> (for thus diuersly forren writers expresse the Hebrue let er <HI>Hheth,</HI> nay sometimes they wholly omit it: as in <HI>Ammon,</HI> their chiefe god, which they worshipped, deriued, as I thinke, from that cursed root) sonne to <HI>Noë,</HI> and father of the aboue-mentioned <HI>Chus,</HI> and <HI>Misraim.</HI> And indeed <HI>Isidorus</HI> saith that the inhabitants do, to this day, in their owne language, call this countrey <HI>Kam.</HI> Yet <HI>Pinetus</HI> and <HI>Marmolius</HI> do iointly affirme (and that truely, as we haue before in the other Mappe of <HI>Aegypt</HI> demonstrated) that the Aegyptians themselues, as also the Turks, do commonly call it <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Elquibet, Elchi∣betz,</HI> and <HI>Chibth.</HI> Lastly, <HI>Honorius</HI> writeth that it was sometime intituled <HI>EVXAEA,</HI> but vpon what authority or ground, I know not: let him therefore iustifie the trueth of that his assertion.</P>
<P>The bounds of this prouince are these: vpon the East it is confined with the Arabian gulfe (<HI>Bahri'lkolzom,</HI> the Red Sea) <HI>Iudaea,</HI> and <HI>Arabia Petraea:</HI> on the West with the mountaines of <HI>Libya,</HI> and <HI>Marmarica (Barca)</HI> another countrey of <HI>Africa:</HI> in the South it is seuered from <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> (which they terme <HI>Aethiopia</HI> beneath <HI>Aegypt</HI>) by the Greater Cataract or fall of <HI>Nilus (Catadupa, Tully,</HI> in <HI>Scipio's</HI> dreame, calleth it, A place where the riuer is so penned vp betweene two mountaines, that there it runneth not, but rather falleth and powreth downe amaine with such an huge and terrible noise, that some report that the people, nere inhabitants thereabout, naturally, by that meanes, are all deafe or very thicke of hearing.) The Mediterranean or Mid∣land sea, or, if you like better of that, the Egyptian sea (so named of this countrey) doth beat vpon the North coast of it. It is diuided into <HI>The Higher E∣gypt, Middle Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Lower Egypt. THE HIGHER EGYPT</HI> was also otherwise called <HI>Thebais: (Auicenna</HI> in the <HI>47.</HI> chapter of the <HI>2.</HI> tract of his <HI>2.</HI> booke, (and in diuers other places often) with <HI>Nubiensis</HI> my Arabian, calleth it <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Alsahid,</HI> or <HI>Said,</HI> of the theam <HI>Saada,</HI> as I thinke, which signifieth to ascend or rise vp in height.) <HI>MIDDLE EGYPT,</HI> sometimes called <HI>Heptapolis,</HI> and <HI>Heptanomia,</HI> (of the number of the <HI>Nomoi,</HI> or shires of this part) and of some, <HI>Arcadia. THE LOWER EGYPT,</HI> which later authours haue named <HI>Augustamnica,</HI> is diuided, in the <HI>Nouella</HI> of <HI>Iu∣stinian,</HI> into <HI>The first,</HI> and <HI>The second.</HI> The booke of Remembrances <HI>(liber Notitiarum)</HI> diuideth <HI>Egypt</HI> into six prouinces: namely, <HI>Libya the vpper, Libya the Neather, Thebais, Aegypt</HI> (properly so called) <HI>Archadia</HI> and <HI>Augustamnica.</HI> That part of the <HI>Lower Egypt</HI> which is enclosed betweene the sea, the two mouthes or floud-gates of the riuer <HI>Nilus, Heracleoticum</HI> and <HI>Pelusiacum,</HI> and from their parting a little beneath <HI>Memphis</HI> in the South, is of all ancient Geographers, Historians and Poets, in respect of the forme and proportion of it, called <HI>DELTA:</HI> for it is, as you see, of forme triangular like vnto Δ, the fourth capitall letter of the Greeke alphabet. And this also of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> (who was borne here, and therefore knew the state of it best) diuided into <HI>Great Delta, Little Delta,</HI> and <HI>Middle Delta,</HI> or the Third Delta. This Delta, as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifieth, of all the chiefe parts of the world was somtime accounted the Fourth, and reckened vp amongst the ilands, and was not esteemed as any portion of the continent. Vnder <HI>Egypt</HI> also, the three <HI>OSITAE,</HI> beyond the Libyan mountaines, are vulgarly comprehended: yea and <HI>LIBYA</HI> it selfe to, if a man may giue credit to <HI>Ammianus.</HI></P>
<P>This countrey is watered with no other riuer than <HI>NILVS,</HI> of all the riuers in the world the most famous and renowmed, and therefore called &amp; knowen by the greatest variety of names: for the ancients haue giuen this riuer many titles: Some haue called it <HI>AEGYPTVS</HI> (from whence the whole country tooke the name); others <HI>OCEANVS</HI> (the sea, in respect of the greatnesse of it); <HI>AETOS</HI> (an eagle, for the swiftnesse of the streame); <HI>NIGIR, MELAS,</HI> (or <HI>Melo) SIRIS, TRITON, CHRYSORRHOAS</HI> (Gilden-flood, of the goodnesse and beauty of his waters); and others, <HI>DYRIS. Orus Apollo</HI> writeth, that the Egyptians in their language called it <HI>NOYVM,</HI> that is, as I thinke, <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> sweet, pleasant, delightfull: for so the impostor <HI>Mahomet</HI> v∣seth this word in the xxxij. Azoara of his wicked Alcoran; as also the Arabian paraphrast, <HI>2. Pet. 2.13.</HI> And <HI>R. Saadias Hagaon, Gen 2.15.</HI> calleth Pa∣radise, <HI>Phardusi'nnaym;</HI> which the forenamed beast, at the <HI>66.</HI> Azoara, nameth <HI>Ginnati'nnaym,</HI> The pleasant garden. <HI>Iosephus</HI> calleth it <HI>GEON,</HI> or <HI>Ginon,</HI> for that, as <HI>R. Salomon Yarhi</HI> the great Rabbine thinketh, it runneth from his fountaine, or rather rusheth on with great violence and hideous noise: <HI>Arias Montanus</HI> affirmeth, that in the Holy Scripture it is named <HI>PHISON,</HI> because, as the forenamed Iew sayth, his waters do spread themselues, swell, and wax so high, that they flow ouer the banks, and water the whole land: And <HI>SIHOR,</HI> that is, blacke, or troubled, for that the waters of the same, issuing from a durty fenne, with great violence oft breaking ouer into the medowes and marsh grounds, by which it coasteth along for many hundred miles to∣gether, are thicke and muddy. The Georgians call it <HI>MAHARA,</HI> that is, swift, or violent: item, <HI>BAHARI'NNIL,</HI> the sea of <HI>Nilus.</HI> The Africanes, as <HI>Marmolius</HI> writeth, commonly call it <HI>NIL,</HI> that is, in my iudgement <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Nehil,</HI> or <HI>Neil,</HI> of the theame <HI>Nahal,</HI> which in the Arabian dialect signi∣fieth to be liquid, thinne, dissolued and apt to runne: from whence in the Hebrew tongue is deriued <HI>Náhal,</HI> a streame, or swift water course. And this opini∣on of mine <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> the worthy Geographer doth seeme to patronage, where he writeth, that <HI>In horum finibus fons est, quem Nili esse aliqui∣bus credibile est, Nuchul ab incolis dicitur, &amp; videri potest non alio nomine appellari, sed à barbaro ore corruptius, &amp;c.</HI> In the confines of <HI>Ethi∣opia</HI> there is a spring, which some do verily thinke to be the head of <HI>Nilus, Nuchyl</HI> the inhabitants and countrey people do call it; and it may seeme probable that they name it by no other name, only the barbarous word is corrupted and otherwise pronounced of forreners, &amp;c. The Abassines, Ethiopians and other nations inhabiting neere vnto it, do call it by diuers and sundry other names, as thou mayest see more at large in our Geographicall treasury. It vnladeth it selfe, as most men thinke, and all antiquity hath constantly affirmed, into the Midland sea by seuen mouthes or very great floudgates. <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in his time made mention of nine, but of them, two were false gates (<HI>pseudostomata,</HI> he termeth them) then almost quite stopped vp. <HI>Pliny</HI> speaketh of eleuen, of which foure were false gates, the other seuen were great and more renowmed. <HI>Herodotus</HI> also mentioneth two false gates, but in all he speaketh not of more than seuen: with him <HI>Eustathius</HI> word for word agreeth. And that which of these mouthes or falles are of this man held for a trueth, in others are held for false and contrariwise. The like difference there is about the names and proper appellations of these mouthes, euen in the best approoued authours. <HI>Pliny</HI> ma∣keth <HI>Heracleoticum</HI> to be a diuers and distinct mouth from <HI>Canopicum:</HI> in which notwithstanding, it seemeth, he is much deceiued: yea and <HI>Diodo∣rus Siculus</HI> doth flatly deny it, affirming that <HI>Canopicum</HI> is otherwise named <HI>Herculeum,</HI> or <HI>Heracleoticum.</HI> All this difference about the names, number, and nature of these mouthes, if I mistake not the matter, arose in continuance of time, from the change and alteration of places. For euery man de∣scribeth them according to the situation of the sea coast, as it then was in that time wherein he liued, which by violence of tide and inundatious, drifts of sand and shifting of the same backe againe, in processe of time haue sometime one forme, somtime another, as is very likely, and they do very well know which dwell neere to the sea; who do neuer wonder to see riuers change their channels and leaue their ancient course: to see their mouthes sometime to be quite dette vp with sand, and to seeke new issues and channels, where neuer none were before: or to see them which in former times were not nauigable, but full of flats and shelfs, afterward to become deepe and able to entertaine ships of good burden. <HI>Galen</HI> sayth, that this riuer, for goodnesse of water, hath but few peeres. <HI>A∣rethaeus</HI> the Cappadotian sayth that the water is thicke: <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the eighth booke of his <HI>Conuiual.</HI> calleth it <HI>turbidam</HI> troubled, and muddy: <HI>Statius</HI> in his fourth booke <HI>Amor.</HI> sayth that it is sweet, and coole without any vnpleasantnesse in taste: and therefore he addeth in the same place that the Egyptians do neuer feare any want or dearth of wine. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> sayth, that for sweetnesse it doth surpasse all other riuers in the whole world beside: which opinion of his, <HI>Pescennius Niger,</HI> an Emperor, did long since auouch to be true, when he thus answered his garrison souldiers, demanding wine of him, Haue ye <HI>Nilus,</HI> and yet do ye demand wine? A description of this riuer thou maist see in <HI>Claudian.</HI> Of his inundation and ouerflowing euery yere, beside others, reade <HI>Stra∣bo,</HI> and the Panegyricke oration pronounced before <HI>Traian</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome.</HI> Item <HI>Achilles Statius</HI> and <HI>Heliodorus.</HI> He that listeth and hath more vacant time, to these may adde <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his treatise of mountaines. Mountaines of <HI>Egypt,</HI> beside those which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> mentioneth; namely, <HI>Mon∣tes Libyci, Troicus, Alabastrinus, Porphyritis, Smaragdus, Aiaces, Acabes, Niger, Basanites,</HI> and <HI>Pentadactylus,</HI> are diuers, as <HI>Nitria, Pherme, Sinopius, Climax, Eos, Lacmon, Crophi,</HI> and <HI>Mophi.</HI> They haue many Fennes, yet these two only, <HI>Moeris</HI> and <HI>Maria,</HI> are of name.</P>
<P>Ancient writers haue diuided this countrey into many <HI>Nomous, (Pliny</HI> expoundeth it Shires or Counties, ech hauing a Shiriffe or Lieutenant ouer it) of which <HI>Herodotus</HI> mentioneth but <HI>18. Diodorus Siculus</HI> sayth that there were of them <HI>36.</HI> and <HI>Ptolemcy</HI> speaketh of <HI>46.</HI> and reckoneth them vp all by their seuerall names: and so many or more <HI>Pliny</HI> telleth vs of. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth of <HI>36.</HI> and thus generally pointeth them out: <HI>Thebais,</HI> saith he, conteined <HI>10.

But with <HI>Pliny</HI> we find by experience, that the names of them oft times are changed, and one place put for another: of which we haue spoken more fully in our Geographicall treasurie. <HI>Eusebius</HI> writeth that in this one countrey there were more cities, than in all the whole world beside. <HI>Egypt,</HI> beside their brag of great antiquity, boasteth, that in the time of <HI>Amasis</HI> their king, it had <HI>20000.</HI> cities: and now it hath very many, as <HI>Pliny</HI> sayth, although they be but small and of no great account.

<PB REF="309"/> we haue most diligently sought the names of them out of all maner of writings and monuments of antiquity, yet we could not finde mention of many more than <HI>300.</HI> as this Mappe doth giue thee to vnderstand. Thus mighty <HI>Ioue</HI> doth sport himselfe in earthly things.</P>
<P>The Mappe doth shew the situation of this countrey, and therefore I shall not need to speake ought of that. What the great fertility and richnesse of soile of this prouince was, that worthy commendation vulgarly spoken of it, wherein it is sayd to be, <HI>The common barne of all the world,</HI> doth sufficiently shew. For, although it neuer raineth here, yet it breedeth great plenty of men and beasts, with all maner of cattell whatsoeuer. But this indeed their riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> by his inundation euery yeere, bringeth to passe: wherupon, as the poet <HI>Lucan</HI> writeth, this is <HI>Terra suis contenta bonis, non indiga mercis, Aut Iouis: in solo tanta est fiducia Nilo:</HI> A land that of it selfe is rich enough, It need'th no forren aid, Ioues helpe it scorn'th: so much it stand'th, vpon the bounty of the Nile. Yea they were woont proudly to vaunt, as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifieth, that they caried in their hands the dearth or plenty of the Romans those mighty conquerours. The riches and wealth of this countrey one may easily esteeme, by that of <HI>Diodorus,</HI> who writeth that the Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> vsed yerely to haue, of <HI>Alexandria</HI> only, a Subsidie of aboue twelue thousand ta∣lents; item, out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> in whom I reade that <HI>Auletes,</HI> father to <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> leuied yeerely in <HI>Egypt</HI> a Subsidie of twelue thousand and fiue hundred talents (which doth amount, according to <HI>Budey</HI> his estimation, to seuenty fiue hundred thousand French crownes:) and that, as he there addeth, vnder a very loose and bad kinde of gouernment. <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his second booke <HI>de Praepar. Euang.</HI> reporteth that <HI>Osiris</HI> their king did erect and make, for <HI>Iupiter</HI> and <HI>Iuno</HI> his parents, and for other gods, temples and shrines of beaten gold and siluer: a maruellous shew of their woonderfull wealth and riches Of the golde-mines of this countrey <HI>Agathar∣cides</HI> hath written something. But so many endlesse and immortall works yet extant, hauing hitherto euen to this day abode all assaults and iniury of time, do suffici∣ently shew what their great command and power in former times hath beene; as namely, are those huge <HI>Pyramides,</HI> so many <HI>Obelisks</HI> of solid marble of one whole stone of such woonderfull height, <HI>Colosses, Sphinges, Statues,</HI> and <HI>Labyrinths:</HI> so many gorgeous <HI>Temples,</HI> of which this one countrey could shew more than all o∣ther countreys beside whatsoeuer, as <HI>Herodotus,</HI> who himselfe was an eye-witnesse of the same, doth plainly affirme. The infinite number of people and inhabitants (which <HI>Philo,</HI> in his booke of Circumcision, ascribeth vnto it) gather out of <HI>Iosephus</HI> and <HI>Egesippus,</HI> who writeth, that beside the citizens of <HI>Alexandria</HI> (which as <HI>Diodorus</HI> testifieth, were three hundred thousand free men) there were seuenteene hundred and fifty thousand enrolled and made free-denisons of <HI>Rome</HI> at once.</P>
<P>It is a very prudent and wise nation, as we may vnderstand by diuers histories; very ingenious in the finding out of any maner of artes and sciences: very quicke of conceit in the search of any inuention whatsoeuer, as <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI> hath left recorded. They are fit and able to attaine to the vnderstanding of all maner of diuine knowledge, as <HI>Macrobius</HI> affirmeth; who also calleth <HI>Egypt, The mother of all artes.</HI> But <HI>Trebellius Pollio,</HI> in the life of <HI>Aemilianus</HI> the Tyrant, sayth that it is a furious and outragious nation, easily mooued to sedition, tumults and rebellion vpon euery light occasion. And <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> sayth that they are a light hea∣ded and giddy brained people, more fit to set matters abroach, than to follow them wisely, when they are once afoot. <HI>Hadrianus</HI> the Emperour, as <HI>Flauius Vopiscus</HI> in the life of <HI>Saturninus</HI> reporteth, calleth it, <HI>Gentem leuem, pendulam, &amp; ad omnia famae monimenta volitantem:</HI> A light and vnconstant nation, hanging as it were by a twin'd thread, and mooued at the least blast and puffe of newes that might stirre. <HI>Seneca</HI> to <HI>Albina</HI> calleth it <HI>Infidam,</HI> A faithlesse nation. <HI>Vento∣sam &amp; insolentem.</HI> A bragging, proud and insolent nation. <HI>Pliny,</HI> in his Panegyricke to Traian the Emperour, termeth them: <HI>Nequitias tellus scit dare nulla magis:</HI> No countrey in the world I am sure, More vilder knaues did ere endure, sayth the Poet <HI>Martiall. Philo</HI> in his booke of Husbandry sayth that they haue <HI>Innatam &amp; insignem iactantiam,</HI> that is, that, they it bred in the bone that an Egyptian should be a famous bragger. Yet he sayth that they are withall wise and in∣genious. <HI>Apuleius</HI> termeth them <HI>Eruditos,</HI> Learned Egyptians: and <HI>Themistius Euphrada, Sapientissimos homines,</HI> Very wise and cunning fellowes. <HI>Philo∣stratus</HI> sayth, that they be much giuen to Theology and study of heauenly things. <HI>Strabo</HI> hath left recorded, that they were no warlike people. Of famous knaues they possessed the middle ranke, according to that olde prouerbe, <HI>Lydimali, secundi Aegyptij, tertij Cares. The Lydians are the great knaues, The Egyptians meane knaues be, The clownish hobs of Caria are The least knaues of the three:</HI> as <HI>Eustathius</HI> vpon <HI>Dionysius Afer</HI> reporteth. Of the customes and maner of life of this nation, <HI>Porphyrius</HI> speaketh much in his fourth booke, intituled, Of abstinence from flesh meats. The most famous cities, which we haue read of in the ancient writers of both languages, are these: First, <HI>ALEXANDRIA,</HI> which <HI>Athenaeus</HI> nameth The beautifull and golden citie: the Councell of <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> The great citie: <HI>Marcelline,</HI> The head of all cities in the world: <HI>Eunapius,</HI> Another world. <HI>Dion Prusaeus</HI> sayth, that it is the second citie of all that are vnder the cope of heauen. The chiefe temple heere called <HI>Sebasteum</HI> (or <HI>Augusteum,</HI> that is, Princely, or, Emperiall) hath no peere. This thou mayst see described by <HI>Philo Iu∣daeus</HI> in his booke <HI>De vita contemplatiua.</HI> The <HI>Serapium,</HI> another stately building in this citie, so adorned and beautified with diuers goodly galleries, many gor∣geous and lofty columnes and pillars, set out with most liuely imagery, and diuers and sundry other rare works and deuices, the best that the most excellent Architects of the world might inuent, that next after the Capitoll, of which reuerend <HI>Rome</HI> doth so much glory, the whole world it selfe hath neuer seene ought more rich and sumptuous, at <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> writeth of it. <HI>Strabo</HI> in the seuenteenth booke of his Geography, doth most brauely describe the whole citie. The like doth <HI>Statius Alexandrinus</HI> in his fifth booke of Loue: and <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in the <HI>17</HI> booke of his history. Item, <HI>Hirtius</HI> in his booke <HI>De bello Alexandrino. THE∣BAE</HI> was the next citie of great note, famous for the multitude of gates that sometimes it had: and thereupon it was otherwise called <HI>Hecatompylos,</HI> Hundred-gate; and <HI>Diospolis,</HI> Gods-towne: item, <HI>Busyris:</HI> and <HI>Thebestis,</HI> as <HI>S. Hierome</HI> affirmeth. <HI>MEMPHIS,</HI> an ancient towne, renowmed by reason that their kings ordi∣narily kept their Court here, was accounted one of the greatest cities of this kingdome. <HI>COPTOS,</HI> a great Mart-towne, well frequented with Arabian and Indian merchants. Of this city the whole prouince tooke the name, as we haue elswhere shewed before. <HI>ABYDVS,</HI> the Court and Emperiall seat of <HI>Memnon</HI> their king, fa∣mous for the temple of <HI>Osiris.</HI> I omit <HI>SYENE</HI> with diuers others: for it were more than needeth here to recken them vp all; because they offer themselues at an in∣stant, to him that shall but cast his eye on the Map. Besides that, <HI>Herodotus, Diodorus, Pliny, Iosephus, Marcellinus, Philostratus, Eusebius,</HI> and diuers other good authours, yet extant, and in many mens hands, haue most eloquently and diligently described them, and set them out in their true and liuely colours.</P>
<P>The situation of this countrey, the riuers, mountaines, cities and strange things there to be seene, we haue already described, according as the capacity of the place assigned, would permit. Now it remaineth that with like breuity also we do, out of <HI>Diodorus, Herodotus, Strabo, Athenaeus, Aelianus, Plutarch, Philo, Euse∣bius, Pliny, Heliodorus, Lucian, Ammian, Clemens, Athanasius, Prudentius,</HI> and others, speake something of their religion. <HI>Eusebius</HI> in his first booke <HI>De Praepar. Euang.</HI> teacheth me, that the Egyptians were the first men, that euer honoured the Sunne, Moone and the rest of the Starres, for immortall Gods. But not only the Holy scripture, but euen profane authours also doe plentifully testifie that they were euer from the beginning the vainest men of the world, and in this their di∣uine seruice, and choice of gods, of all other most fond and foolish: for beside the gods of the Gentiles, as <HI>Iupiter, Iuno, Vulcane, Venus, Bacchus,</HI> and such others, which they had and worshipped common with all the world, (yet by their seuerall and different names, as <HI>Isis, Osiris, &amp;c.</HI>) they moreouer, as <HI>Artemidorus</HI> and <HI>Ci∣cero</HI> in the third booke of the Nature of gods do testifie, consecrated all kinde of beasts and liuing creatures. <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirmeth, that they accounted all maner of beasts which they had in <HI>Egypt,</HI> as sacred and holy; so that, as <HI>Dion</HI> reporteth, they farre surpassed all nations of the world in multitude and variety of gods. Nei∣ther did they only reuerence these as gods, but also <HI>Anubis, Orus, Typhon, Pan</HI> (whom they called <HI>Mendon</HI> and painted him with a goats head) and the Satyrs. Item another, which, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Osiris</HI> writeth, they called <HI>Cneph.</HI> Moreouer, <HI>Minutius Felix</HI> sayth, that they worshipped a man, and in the city <HI>Anabis</HI> did all maner of diuine seruice vnto him, as vnto an immortall God, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> auoucheth; who furthermore addeth, that they had another peculiar god, which they cal∣led <HI>Canopus,</HI> and expressed in the forme of a pot. (This <HI>Bembus</HI> hath described in his Hieroglyphicall table.) <HI>Athanasius</HI> and <HI>Heliodorus</HI> doe testifie, that they accounted the water, but especially <HI>Nilus,</HI> for a god. Of foure footed beasts, the Crocodile, the Oxe, the Mneuis, the Lion, the Beare, the Cat, the Hee-goat, the Monkey, the Ape, the Bull, the Ramme, the Shee-goat, the Hogge, the Dogge, the Ichneumon or Indian rat, the Woolfe, the Sheepe, the Weazell, and the Shrew∣mous, they put into the inuentory of their gods. Of fishes, the Oxyrinchus, the Lepidotus, the Latus, the Phagrus, the Maeotis (fishes proper to the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI>) and the Eccle: beside the Cantharus, as <HI>Porphyrius</HI> in his booke <HI>De sacrificijs</HI> testifieth. Of birds, the Eagle, the Ibis, and the Hawke: beside the Owsell or Blacke-bird, if we may beleeue <HI>Hyginus:</HI> and the Vulture and Rauen, as <HI>Aelianus</HI> affirmeth: with the Sparrow, as <HI>Porphyrius</HI> in his Treatise <HI>De Abstinentia,</HI> maketh vs be∣leeue. <HI>Iosephus</HI> in his second booke against <HI>Appion</HI> sayth that they worship the Ferrit. They had beside these, the Dragon, (or serpent) the Aspis (which they na∣med <HI>Thermathis</HI>) and the Beetle. The counterfets of these for the most part they adored and worshipped as gods; yet some delighted rather to honour the very beast themselues aliue: so that it was felony for a man to kill any of them, although it were by chance. And if so be that one of them should fortune to die of any disease, they vsed to bury it with mourning and great solemnity. Item certaine vegetable things without life, as Onions, Leekes, and Garleeke, they did adore with diuine ho∣nour, as <HI>S. Hierome,</HI> against <HI>Iouinian,</HI> testifieth of the <HI>Pelusiotae.</HI> Nay they did not content themselues with these naturall things, but euen certeine monsters, such as were neuer seene in the world, they did in like maner consecrate for gods: as the Cynocephalus, with a dogges head, worshipped of the Hermopolitani: and Cepus, honoured of the Babylonians. To these you may adde out of <HI>Athanasius</HI> the Serpenticipites, idols with serpents heads: and Asinicipites, with asses heads. Moreo∣uer, in the villages and vpland townes, <HI>Lucian</HI> reporteth, (I know not whether in iest or earnest) that some held the right shoulder for a god: but those that dwelt o∣uer against them, the left. Some did sacrifice to the one halfe of the head: others to a Samian cup or dish. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> reporteth, (I blush to speake it) that they accounted the priuy parts for a god. <HI>Eusebius,</HI> in the second booke <HI>De praeparat. Euangel.</HI> seemeth to restraine it only to <HI>Osiris. Clemens</HI> in the fifth booke of his <HI>Recognitionum</HI> addeth (blush foolish idolaters, for I will tell it, and let another say surreuerence) that the Egyptians worshipped the Iakes and a Part for their gods; which also is auerred and iustified by <HI>Minutius Felix.</HI> This is that which <HI>Lactantius</HI> reporteth of them, that they reuerenced certaine beastly and shamefull things. <HI>Philo Iudaeus</HI> sayth, that all things vnder the cope of heauen are consecrated and enrowled amongst the number of their gods. And <HI>Sextus</HI> the Philosopher sayth of them, that there was not any thing which they did not hold for sacred. Thus much of their gods: more thou mayest see of this matter in <HI>Clemens,</HI> but especi∣ally in <HI>Iuuenall</HI> the Poet. These do hold themselues to be the first and most ancient Nation in the world, and to haue first had the knowledge of God, to haue built tem∣ples, groues and conuents in honour of them, as <HI>Lucian</HI> testifieth. Afterward, when the light of the Gospell began to shine forth, here great swarmes of Monkes and Heremites were bred, and from hence were spred and scattered all Christendome ouer, as we finde in the Records of the Primitiue Church: so that a man may iustly terme this countrey The Seminary or Nursery of all religions. Of the Philosophy, and Hieroglyphicall secrets of the Egyptians, reade the sixt booke of <HI>Clemens Ale∣xandrinus</HI> his Stromaton. Item, <HI>Orus Apollo</HI> and <HI>Pierius</HI> his Hieroglyphicks.</P>

<HEAD>The VOIAGE of ALEXANDER THE GREAT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F Archelaus the Chorographer, whom Diogenes Laërtius affirmeth to haue described all that part of the earthly globe or maine continent conquered by Alexander the Great, that famous king of Macedony: or Beton [<HI>Baeton,</HI> Athenaeus calleth him] and Dio∣genetus, whom Pliny writeth were the measurers of the iourney of the said Alexander: or if the Commentaries of Strabo, which he saith that he composed of the histories and famous acts of that great Conquerour, were now extant, it would out of all doubt haue beene an easier matter for vs to haue made this map which heere we purpose to set foorth to the view and benefit of the serious stu∣dent of Geography, of the VOIAGE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT: But being destitute of those helpes, first we haue laid the plot of it out of Ptolemey, and some other later writers. Then we haue set downe in it all those particular places which Quin∣tus Curtius, Arrianus and Plutarch doe make mention of in the historie of this expedition. For these three, of all those which haue at large written of his life, and are come to our hands, haue of purpose handled this his voiage and expedition. To these, as helps, we haue adioined what we finde making for this our purpose, in Strabo, Diodorus, Trogus, Orosius and Plutarch, in that his booke which he hath intituled, Of the fortune and prosperous successe of Alexander, for these men, although they haue not purposedly intended that argument, yet notwithstanding by the way they haue shewed themselues, in the setting out of his memorable acts, very diligent and faithfull authours. Item Philostratus, Solinus and Pliny haue in like maner done vs some seruice heerein. And while I looke ouer all maner of histories written either in Greeke or Latine, by any other authours whatsoeuer, beside those aboue named, I could picke very little or nothing out of them, that might serue vs in this our argument to any sted at all. For although some things may be obserued in the reading of Liuy, Valerius Maximus Polybius, Athenaeus, Polyaenus, Aelianus, Seneca, Stobaeus, Quintilian, Apuleius, Dion Pruiaeus, Maximus Tyrius, Theon Sophista, Plutarch in his treatise of Moun∣teins, and the Panegyricke made to Maxim. and Constant. yet those doe rather seeme in my iudgement, to concerne his priuate life, naturall inclination, maners, ver∣tues, and vices, then this his voiage and expedition. Francis Iuret, in his annotations vpon Symmachus, doth confesse that he hath by him the life of Alexander the Great, written first in the Greeke tongue by one Aesope, and since that translated into Latine by Iulius Valerius. This authour as yet we haue nor seene, and therefore of him we say nothing. We haue therefore (in the description of this Empire of the Macedonians, the greatest, as Liuy in his fiue and fortieth booke nameth it, of all the whole earth, begunne by this our Alexander) performed what we could, not what we would. To this we haue caused the plot and portraiture of Iupiter Ammons o∣racle, famous, as Pomponius Mela writeth, for the certainty of his predictions, to be adioined for an auctuarie and ornament; and for that it is so often named &amp; men∣tioned in all ancient histories: as also for that this our Alexander in this his expedition, went vnto this place, to demand of the Oracle what the issue and euent of this his iourney should be. Lastly Curtins and Trogus do iointly affirme that he commanded that his body, after his death, should heere be buried although it be certaine that this was not performed: for his corps was interred at Alexandria in Egypt. Of it therefore out of sundrie authours we haue collected that which followeth.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The ORACLE of Iupiter Ammon.</HEAD>
<P>THe place where the temple of Iupiter Ammon stood hath round about it vast and huge wildernesses, great heapes of hungry sand, round enclosed on euery side with waste and barren grounds, places wholly vnmanured and vnhabitable. Heere are diuers large fields, as Arrianus, Curtius and Diodorus Siculus doe describe them, cleane couered ouer with sand, like as we oft times see low-meddowes ouerflowed by the breaking in of some great riuer. The middest of this place (Silius Itali∣cus calleth it <HI>Lucus fatidicus,</HI> The fate-telling wood) which conteineth but a little plot of ground (for where it is broadest, it is, as Arrianus writeth, but forty furlongs, or at most, as Diodorus would haue it, not aboue fifty furlongs ouer) is beset with diuers sorts of fruitfull trees, namely, as Arrianus testifieth, with oliues and dates: or, as Theophrastus writeth, with a kinde of Cypresse, or sweet smelling aromaticall tree, which he calleth <HI>Thuia</HI> (our herborists call it, The tree of life) and with the <HI>Paliurus,</HI> a kind of very sharpe thorne, very plentifully growing in Palestina, wherewith some learned men do verily thinke that our Sauiour Christ was crowned by the Romane souldiers, and thereupon is of some called <HI>Christs thorne:</HI> Yea, as Diodorus Siculus reporteth, here doe grow all manner of goodly trees, but especially all sorts of fruit-trees, most plentifully. Pliny also doth highly commend the goodly palme trees of this place. It is watered with diuers pleasant and holesome wels, springs and brookes; and by that meanes it is inhabited, by the Ammonij, a people which dwell in cottages heere and there scattering a good way distant one from another. In the middest of this place there was a tower enclosed with three wals, whereof the first compassed about or defended the ancient pallace of their kings (<HI>tyrannos,</HI> Cur∣tius calleth them) within the second were kept their wiues, children and concubines: heere also stood the temple or Oracle of that god. Within the third and inner wall the guard and armed men did keepe and giue their attendance. Diodorus Siculus reporteth that before the Oracle there was a fountaine, in which, all things whatsoeuer were to be offered to the god, were first washed and purified. And thus farre of the naturall situation of this Oracle, and the maner of the building and ar∣chitecture of the same: now it remaineth that we should in like maner speake something of the forme and shape of this Libyan god, as Dionysius Afer termeth him; whom they painted not, as we vsually do, casting of thunderbolts, but with a paire of rams hornes vpon his head, as Arnobius, Ouid, Macrobius and others haue left recorded: and those very crooked and wreathen, as Lucian and Ouid haue written. Lucian saith that they expressed him in the forme and shape of a ramme: yet Hero∣dotus seemeth to vnderstand it only of his head and face: In Martianus he is painted with a paire of rammes hornes and a iagged or fringed coat: this also is that which Atheneus meaneth when he calleth it <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as Natalis and Dalechampius do both vnderstand the word. Yet Quintus Curtius doth set him out after another ma∣ner, in this his description of him; That which is worshipped for a god, hath not the same shape and similitude, which commonly artistes and workemen haue attri∣buted to gods: it was like a bosse (<HI>vmbilicus,</HI> he calleth it) made of smaragds and orient pearls. This idol, when an answer was demanded of it, was carried by the Priests in a golden boate or shippe, with diuers and sundrie siluer goblets and peeces hanging round about on each side of the same. Immediately after it did follow a great company of old women and yong maidens, singing in that their language a rude and homely song: whereby they doe verily beleeue they doe much please their god, and do winne him to giue a good and certaine answer to the demand that then is made vnto him. The like doth Diodorus Siculus report of it, who moreouer addeth, the Priests daily attendant heere were in number foureskore at the least. Why he was painted with rammes hornes amongst others, Germanicus and Hyginus in Ariete, doe plainly teach vs: when they write that this temple was first erected by Bacchus, in honour of the ramme, ( <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Hamil,</HI> the Arabians, Dutch and Spaniards call him) wh ch was his guide and conducted him, (being himselfe with his whole army in great distresse, and almost famished for want of drinke) through these desert and sandy wildernesses, vnto this place well serued with water and abounding with diuers wholesome wels and springs. Yet I am not ignorant that He∣rodotus doth bring another reason of the same. This temple (in which, as Plutarch in his booke intituled, Of the ceasing of Oracles, writeth, a lampe did burne continually) was first erected, as Herodotus giueth out, by Thebana Aegyptia, an Aegyptian woman, a Priest of Thebes. Diodorus Siculus teacheth vs that it was built by Danaus an Egyptian. Pausanias he writeth that it was so called of a certaine sheepeheard, which first built a temple heere to Iupiter. Virgil in his fourth booke of his Aeneides, seemeth to ascribe the building of it to Hiarbas King of the Getuli, and sonne of Iupiter. All other ancient authours for the most part do deriue the name from the Greeke word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifieth the sand; so that Iupiter Ammon, should bee nothing else but Sandy Ioue: yet Plutarch contrary to all men, in Osiris, writeth that of the Egyptians it was called <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (or <HI>Thamos,</HI> as Plato in his dialogue intituled Phaedrus, affirmeth) which word in that language he there moreouer addeth, doth signifie an hiding, or any thing that is hid and secret, for proofe whereof he bringeth in Manethon Sebennites, an Egyptian borne, for a witnesse: affir∣ming withall that this idol is corruptly and falsely called Ammon. And indeed the learned doe know that in the Chaldey tongue, (a language of neere affinity vnto the Egyptian) <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Hama,</HI> doth signifie to hide, or to conceale from the sight of other mens eies: in the eight and twentieth chapter of Iob: item, to escape, and be∣take himselfe to some place of refuge, to take sanctuary: except the copies in those places be corrupt and faulty. But this is certaine that <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Tham,</HI> or <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Tamtam,</HI> in the same language doth signifie, to shut vp, to locke vp or hide from the sight of others; as men doe their treasures, answering directly to the Hebrew theme <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Thaman.</HI> I cannot but woonder when I call to mind the inscription of an Egyptian obeliske or statue erected in the city Thebes by king Ramesses, where there is oft mention made of Ammon, as thou maist read in the seuenteenth booke of Ammianus Marcellinus. This Oracle, although it was of all heathen nations far and nere round about, had in great reuerence, and held for most certaine and true: yet Strabo the famous Geographer, who liued in the daies of Tiberius Caesar, at such time as Christian religion began more cleerely to shine forth; and Plutarch, who liued in the time of Traiane the Emperour, do iointly and plainly testifie, that in their times it was very much neglected. Prudentius, the Christian poet, who wrot about the reigne of Theodosius, iustifieth the same in this his verse: <HI>Nec responsa refert Libycis in syrtibus Ammon:</HI> God Ammon on the Libyan sands, now answer'th no demands at all. In the daies of Iustinian, it seemeth by Procopius in the sixth booke <HI>Aedificior.</HI> that it was altogether desert and vnfrequented. Whether this be that same place which is described by Clemens Alexandrinus in his Stromaton, and by Eusebius in his booke <HI>De praeparat. Euangel.</HI> vnder the name of <HI>Gerandryus,</HI> placed by them in these sands, I would gladly learne of those that are more learned than my selfe. About this Oracle which we haue hitherto described, there is on the East side, a forest or groue, Curtius calleth it <HI>nemus,</HI> Solinus, <HI>lucus:</HI> but Diodorus saith it is a chappel: <HI>templum.</HI> within which there is <HI>Aqua Solis,</HI> or, as others terme it <HI>Fons Solis,</HI> the fountaine of the Sunne: whose water is, as Ouid writeth, at noone as cold as stone, at eeuen and morne as hot as heat of Sun. This fountaine is thus described by Pomponius Mela: This fountaine, saith he, assoone as any man shall but touch it with his hand, it pre∣sently beginneth to swell, and so to tosse vp the sand and to rise in great billowes like vnto the maine sea in tempestuous weather. At mid-night it boileth: by and by, it beginneth by a little and little to coole, vntill at length about the breake of day it becommeth key-cold: Then as the Sunne ariseth, so it waxeth by degrees colder and colder, vntill at noone it becommeth as cold almost as ice. After noone it beginneth againe to waxe warme, and at night it becommeth very hote; and so as the night passeth it groweth still hotter and hotter, vntill at last about midnight it become almost scalding hot. The very same doth Curtius, Diodorus, Herodotus, Pliny, and Lucretius write of this fountaine. The same Lucretius in his sixth booke doth yeeld the reason of this strange miracle. Item, S. Augustine and Solinus doe speake the like almost word for word of it. But Solinus and also Isidorus do make mention of another spring not far from th s place: whose water, as they say, doth binde toge∣ther the dust and clods, and presently turneth embers &amp; ashes into firme ground and solide turffe: Or as Lucane in his ninth booke writeth, <HI>Qui putria terrae alligat, &amp; do∣mitas vnda connectit arenas:</HI> which rotteth and turneth all things to fertile solid ground: and scattering sands in massie lumps of stone it tieth. Againe Antonius Liberalis maketh mention of another spring, which he saith, at Sunset doth congeale and as the Sunne commeth toward it againe doth stand st ll. Item Pliny telleth of another spring in the country of the Troglodites, a people nere inhabiting to this place, which about noone is sweet and coole, but at midnight it boileth &amp; groweth to be very bitter. I will surcease to speake any one word more of these things, after that I haue added that which I haue read in a certaine epistle of Synesius, vnto his friend Euopti∣us, of the inhabitants and people dwelling nere this temple of Ammon, namely that the women haue heere such great paps, that they do not giue their children sucke as heere they vse, but do cast their breasts ouer their shoulders and do giue them sucke behind their backs. And lest any man should doubt of the truth heerof, hear see what Iuuenall writeth of the same in his Satyres; <HI>In Meroē crasso maiorem infante mamillam.</HI> In Meroë the teat oft times is found much bigger than the sucking child. Thus much therefore of the Oracle of Iupiter Ammon, and the fountaine of the Sunne. In the 30. chapter of the booke of Iob, in the originall text <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Hamma</HI> is vsed of the Holy ghost for the Hebrew <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Semes,</HI> the Sunne, which in the 19.

Why then may we not say (aswell for that this Oracle or temple was built neere vnto this fountaine, as also for the ioy and comfort, as is said before, that Bacchus and his consorts enioied by meanes of the same) that this god and his temple tooke the name of Ammon, not of the Sand, but of the Sunne <HI>(Hamma)</HI> whereof the well or spring did beare the name; or otherwise of <HI>Hammam,</HI> a bath? Surely the analogy is proper, and in regard of the affinity of the languages, by ods the etymology more pro∣bable.

<PB REF="311"/> the 4. booke of Quintus Curtius you shall find these words spoken of Alexander. He had an earnest desire (and not without great reason although there were also some reasons to the contrary) to see not only the high country of Egypt, but euen Ethiopia it selfe. The stately pallace of king Memnon and Thiton, famous for the great antiqury o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, did force him to venture that way almost beyond the tropicke of Cancer. Thus farre Curtius. Strabo, Solinus and Pliny, in the fifth booke of his histo∣ry of Nature, doe describe this palace of Memnon to haue beene in the city Abydus. Yet the same Pliny in his 36. booke writeth that it was in Thebes which opinion Pausanias and Dionysius Afer doe confirme to be true. But heere by Thebes I vnderstand Thebais, or the country of Thebae: for both Thebae and Abydus, were ci∣ties of this prouince. In this palace was the image or statue of the said Memnon, as Pliny calleth it: Strabo saith it was a Colossus: and Tacitus termeth it <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xiam offigi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a,</HI> a counterfet cut in stone. For, as Strabo testifieth, it was made of one solide stone: of colour blacke, as Philostratus affirmeth: or red, as Tzetzes, I know not vpon what ground and authority, would make vs beleeue. Pausanias and Philostratus doe write, that it was the image of a king sitting in his chaire of estate. Moreouer the same Philostratus saith that it did represent the forme of a beardlesse yong man. Strabo recordeth that in his time he saw the vpper part of this image broken off aboue the seat vpon which it was placed. Which Pausanias also doth testifie to be true, affirming that he himselfe had seene the same. the other part, he saith, is yet to be seene sitting. Philostratus writeth that it resteth it selfe, or lying groueling vpon the hands, &amp; beareth the shape of a man that would willingly raise himselfe being downe. This image, all the forenamed authors do affirme, euery day at sun rising (and, as Philostratus reporteth, as long as the sun beames touched the same) did make a noise at the mouth, much like to the sound of an harpe; which is also auouched by Pausanias: although we are not ignorant that Tacitus writeth that it did speake and counterfet the voice of man. Pliny saith that it did but crackle. It is apparent that Lucian doth but scoffe and iest, (which is an ordinary thing in him) when as he writeth that hee heard th s image speake, and that not after a vulgar maner making a foolish and vaine babling, but to vtter an oracle in meter of 7 verses long. I do in like maner hold that of Tzetzes, in 64. section of his 6. Chiliade (as also many other things in him in other places) to be but a meere fable, when as he reporteth, that this image in the day time did vsually sing a pleasant song, but in the night a very mournfull and lamentable dittie. Peraduenture he had this from Callistus, who writeth that this image when the Sun came toward it, did make a pleasant noise, but when it went from it, it made a heauy and sorrowfull sound. But of this noise or sound let vs heare Strabo, a graue authour, a man of great credit and a diligent obseruer of this strange woonder: I my selfe, saith he, was present with Aelius Gallus, together with a great mul∣titude of his friends and souldiers that were with him, about one of the clocke in the day, and I heard a sound, but whether it came from the basis, or from the colosies, or image it selfe, or from some of those that stood about it, I was not able to discerne, nor dare not for truth affirme: seeing that by reason of the vncerainty of the cause, I had rather suspect any thing, than to beleeue and teach that stones laid and ioined together in that maner should make a sound Eustathius vpon Dionysius Aier doth obserue that this was ordinarily done by a kind of instrument: but I dare not giue much credit vnto him, who is oft times himselfe too light of beliefe. Pausanias writeth that the Thebenes do flatly denie this to be the statue or image of Memnon the Aethiopian, but to be indeed the counterfet of Phanemophes, a natural Egyp∣tian borne. Item, that the heard say of some that it was the image of Sesostris. Strabo writeth that there be some which thinke Memnon to haue beene called of the E∣gyptians Ismandes. Dion Prusaeus in his 31. oration writeth that it had no maner of inscription or letters written about it at all. But it seemeth to haue beene the statue of Memnon, in regard that Heliodorus, amongst the gods, worshipped by the Ethiopians, doth also reckon Memnon for one. Mention is in like maner made of this image in that verse of Iuuenall: <HI>Diminio magicae resonant vbi M-mnone chordae;</HI> Where curtall'd Memnons harpe, by magicke skill, with musicke sweet and warbling sound the eares doth fill. <HI>Dimidium,</HI> curtall'd, hee calleth it, as I thinke, because the vpper part, as wee heard before, was broken off from the rest of the body, which Pau∣sanius saieth vpon Cambyles: but Strabo rather thinketh it to be done by an earthquake. Vpon the forenamed verse of Iuuenall, an ancient glosse writeth thus, (I deli∣uer it for no truth; only take it as it is, corrupt and false) The statue, saith he, of Memnon, made of brasse, holding an harpe in his hands, at certaine houres made a plea∣sant sound. This king Caubis (Cambyles, I thinke he meaneth) caussed to be broken vp, supposing that there had beene within it some engine or mechanicall auto∣maton, that had made this sound yet notwithstanding the statue which had beene made and consecrated by art magicke, after it had beene opened, did still at certain times make a noice as afore. But these are meere fooleries: as also these following are, out of another ancient interpreter of the same poet, as they are alleadged by Ia∣nus Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in his commentaries vpon Catullus; namely, that this statue or image did vsuallie in plaine words salute both the Sunne and the King: but after that Cam∣byses had broken or cut off a peece of it, it saluted the Sunne onely, but not the King. The Chronicle of Eusebius relateth, from the opinion of the common people, th t it spake vntill the comming of our Sauiour Christ. And thus much of this statue of Memnon, which Curtius saith Alexander had a great desire to see: the reason of whose strange miracle, Tacitus reporteth, Germanicus Caesar did much labour to conceiue: and which, Spartianus testifieth, Septimius Seuerus the Emperour did verie diligently view, and behold with great admiration.</P>
<P>By that description of Iupiter Ammon in Curtius, it seemeth that he meant to expresse vnto vs two formes of it: viz. one which was accounted to bee his image or counterfet, the other was that which was worshipped for a god: that had the shape of a ramme, this the forme of a bosse <HI>(vmbilicus)</HI> For I vnderstand by the word <HI>vm∣bilicus,</HI> any high thing that steeketh out (as the nauil in a man) in maner of a pyramis, or conus round or square: Like as in books almost finished, as Porphyrius testifieth, they ordinarily vsed to doe either for ornament or some speciall purpose; yea and yet to this day still they are put vpon the outside in forme of a round globe. For men of ancient families were wont, as we do gather by many circumstances, oft times in this rude manner to point at their gods, rather then truely to expresse them in their true forme and proportion. In the temple of Delphos, as Strabo in the 6. booke of his Geography reporteth, there was a bosse preserued, curiously lapped vp in skarfes and ribbends, to demonstrate and shew vnto the world, that this place was in <HI>Vmbilico,</HI> that is, in the middest or center of the whole earth: and it was made, as Pausanias writeth, of pure white marble. For the statue or image of the goddesse Venus, which was to be seene at Paphus in Cyprus, as Tacitus reporteth, was a continuall cir∣cle, broad at the bottome, with a thinne edge or brim, rising vp narrower and narrower by degrees, in manner of a pyrarnis. Maximus Tyrius in his 38. oration spea∣keth the same of it, almost word for word: but that he saith it was like a white pyramis. The same authour in the same place writeth, that the Arabians portraitured their god in forme of a square or cubicall stone: and as Suidas affirmeth, it had no manner of carued worke vpon it at all. But this he speaketh of the Arabians of Pe∣tiaea, and withall addeth that this their god is called Mars. Minutius Felix maketh the same god to be but a rough stone, vnhew'd or vnpolish't. Liuy also testifieth that the Pessinuntij, a people in Phrygia, did honour a stone for the mother of the gods. Arnobius in his 6. booke saith that it was a flint stone, of no great bignesse, of co∣lour blacke or very darke and duskish, verie craggy, rough and vneuen. Prudentius also in his 7. booke saith, that it was of colour browne or inclining to blacke. He∣rodianus reporteth almost the same of the forme of the statue of the Sunne or Elagabalus, that Quintus Curtius doth of his god Ammon: These are his words as you may read in his 5. booke: They haue no image carued and made by arte of man, after the manner of the Greekes or Romanes, to expresse the similitude of that god: But there is a very great stone, round at the bottome, and tapred vpward almost in manner of that Geometricall body which the Mathematicians do call <HI>Conus.</HI> The Sicyonij, citizens of Sicyona city in Peloponnesus in Greece, as Pausanias writeth, did make their Iupiter Milichius in forme of a pyramis or taper. The Semni, a sect of Philosophers in India, as Clemens Alexandrinus reporteth, did adore and do religious seruice to a pyramis. Hither peraduenture that signe of the profane Sa∣crament mentioned by Firmicus, is to be referred. Yea and the Romanes themselues vnder this forenamed figure doubtlesse did meane to expresse some god or other, as appeareth by that scaffold or chaire, described by the foresaid Herodian, made in manner of a turret or lanterne, in which their Emperours were crowned and en∣stalled, and was indeed of them enrowled amongst the number of their gods or saints as you please to terme them. For this also was so built that it did rise from the bottome vpward lesse &amp; lesse by degrees, vntil at length it came to the highest &amp; last roome, which was the least and narrowest of all. Hither also are to be referred those obeliskes or pyramides of the Egyptians, built in forme not much vnlike those <HI>Vmbilici,</HI> before mentioned, dedicated also to the Sunne. Item those spires <HI>(metae)</HI> in the theaters dedicated to the Dioscuri or Tyndarides. The fire (which signifieth the goddesse <HI>Vesta,</HI> <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Esta,</HI> the Chaldees call the fire) also was expressed in this forme, whose temple was built round, and tapered vpward. All which do come very neere to the forme of a bosse <HI>(Vmbilicus)</HI> or that Geometricall body called by them <HI>Conus.</HI> Out of these I gather that the ancient reading in the old imprinted copies of Quintus Curtius, which haue <HI>Vmbilico similis,</HI> like a bosse, is much better and more probable, than that late edition set out the other day by a learned man, which readeth, <HI>Vmbilico tenus arieti similis,</HI> to the nauill like a ramme. But all these will appeare more plaine and cleare to the reader by the comparison of certaine monies and coines, as may be seene in those authours which haue of purpose written of the ancient Romane coines. Moreouer certaine nations also (although this be not altogether to our purpose, yet I take it not amisse to adde a word or two of it, by the way) were woont to attribute no great beauty to their gods. For Arnobius writeth that the Scythians for the signe or idol of their god did vse a skene or short sword. The The∣spij, citizens of Thespia, a city in Boetia in Greece, did adore and do diuine honour to a bough of Progne: The Romanes for Quirinus (or Romulus, as some thinke) to a speare. The Samij did reuerence a well for Iuno: and the Carij, a rough and vnhewed peece of timber, for Diana. Pausanias witnesseth that the Sicyonij honou∣red Diana Paetroa, vnder the forme of a columne or rude pillar rough and vnpolished. Maximus Tyrius reporteth that the Celtae did do reuerence to a very high oke as vnto the signe or image of mighty Ioue. The same authour testifieth that the Paeones for the Sunne, did diuine honour to a little dish or platter put vpon the toppe of a long pole. Tertullian telleth vs that Pallas Attica, and Ceres Farrea were put vpon the end of an ill-fauor'd pole, rugged stake or rough peece of wood. Faria, or Pharia, which Lipsius liketh better, to whom also I assent, for that in a certaine coine which Antonius Augustinus setteth out in his Dialogues, together with the image and picture of this goddesse, there is this inscription ISIS PHARIA. seeing that also as Herodotus and Plutarch doe testifie, that this same goddesse is the same that Isis, which is worshipped of the Egyptian, is: item that Isis is the same that Dea Pessinuntia is, and this the same that Cybele. So that <HI>Pharia,</HI> as he would haue it, should be the same with <HI>Aegyptia,</HI> vnderstanding thereby Isis of Aegypt. Moreouer Minutius Felix maketh mention of Pharia Isis. Pausanias in his Achaica writeth that in times past it was an ordinary thing generally practised by all the Grecians to worship rude and vnpolished stones for their gods. Item, Herodotus in Clio doth writnesse that the Persians were not woont to make any images, to reare any temples or to build any altars to their gods. We read also that it was the custome of some nations ne∣uer to make any image, portraitures or pictures of their gods at all. For Tacitus writeth that the Syrians neuer made any similitude or temple to their god Carmel, only they built him an altar, and did adore him with a religious worship. The same authour saith, That the Germanes did make no similitudes of their gods: nor did euer attribute vnto them the shape and feature of any mortall man: and moreouer he addeth, that they did see them onely in their deuotions. Strabo saith that the Persians did neither erect images nor altars to their gods. Silius Italicus speaketh thus of the chappell of Hercules at Caliz: <HI>Sed nulla effigies, simulacráue nota Deorum, Ma∣iest ite locum &amp; sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro impleuere timore.</HI> Yea and the Romanes themselues, as Varro telleth the tale, for more then an hundred and fifty yeares together, did worship their gods without any images or idols at all. And indeed Pliny plainly affirmeth, that it is the weakenesse of mans nature to seeke for any similitudes or counterfets of them. But because there is nothing more absolute and perfect than God, it is very probable that the Gentiles did reuerence him vnder that forme, wherewith in all their acti∣ons, when they come to perfection, they are ordinarily beautified, as with a most rich and costly ornament. Why they vsed to carrie this god Ammon in a boate or pinnace, peraduenture we may vnderstand by that of Cornelius Tacitus: where he teacheth that the Sueui were woont to make the image of Isis in manner of a small barke or pinnace: thereby to shew that their religion and manner of seruice of their gods vsed by them, was brought from beyond the sea from forrein countries. Pausanias hath left recorded that the Cyreneans did at Delphos dedicate their God Ammon sitting in a waggon [<HI>Vehiculum,</HI> the interpreter calleth.] <HI>Sic bona posteritas</HI> [Romana scilicet] <HI>Puppim formauit in aere, Hospitis aduentum testificata Dei.</HI> So Romanes old for loue did make This shippe, of purest brasse, To testifie that this their god A farre borne stranger was: this Ouid in this first booke of his <HI>Fasti,</HI> speaketh of the Romane god Ianus. So that what the Romanes meant by this their shippe, <HI>[puppis]</HI> that they meant by their pinnace or wagon <HI>[nauigium,</HI> or <HI>vehiculum.]</HI> Moreouer, amongst the Germanes also in an iland of the maine sea, as Tacitus testifieth, there was a place which he calleth <HI>Castum nemus,</HI> in which there was a waggon consecrated and sanctified, couered ouer with a cloth, and adored as a saint. But peraduenture we haue beene too tedious in this argument.</P>
<P>As we haue out of old and ancient histories laid downe two diuers and sundry formes of this god Ammon; so out of the same it is very probable that hee had two diuers temples: For Diodorus in his seuenteenth booke in the description of this temple, doth say that it was built by Danaus the Egyptian. And the same authour a∣gaine, in his first booke saith, that Ofiris also erected a temple for Iupiter Ammon, in Thebes a city in Egypt: which was all of beaten gold, cleane contrary to that which we haue described before, as appeareth out of these verses of Lucane in his 9. booke: <HI>Non illic libyeae posuerunt ditia gentes Templa, nec Eois splendent donariagemmis.</HI> In E∣gypt it was, not in Libya, as is manifest out of the second booke of Herodotus. Where you shall find this description of it; Iupiter being not willing that Hercules, who came to visit him, should see him, yet at length by importunity being ouercome, vsed this deuice to deceiue him; He tooke a ram, flead him and cut off his head: this fell, with the head, wool and all, he put vpon him, and thus sheweth himselfe to Hercules. Wherupon the Egyptians haue decreed to make the image of Iupiter and to picture him with a rammes head. For him euery yeare, vpon a certaine day, they kill a ramme in like manner as before is shewed, and the skinne they put ouer the image of the said &amp;c. And because the temple of this god Ammon was in the city Thebes, which thereupon is of good writers called <HI>Diospolis,</HI> that is, Ioues towne; I was of o∣pinion that the Holy scripture did also in some place or other speake of it. And indeed in the thirtieth chapter of Ezechiel the septuagints for the Hebrew <HI>No,</HI> haue <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spolu.</HI> and againe in the third chapter of Naum, for No Amon, they haue <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is very probable therefore that Amon (<GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Hamon,</HI> which in the Hebrew tongue signifieth a multitude) was the proper name of this place.</P>

Heere putting to sea againe, he commeth to the <HI>SIRENVM SCOPVLI,</HI> certaine dangerous rockes vpon the coast of <HI>Italy,</HI> in the bay of <HI>Cumae;</HI> and first casting anchor at <HI>PALINVRVS (Paliuro,</HI> or <HI>Cabo Palemudo) [at LEVCASIA,</HI> (Licoso) <HI>as Halicarnasseus sayth: or, INARIME</HI> (Ischia) <HI>and PROCHYTA</HI> (Profida) <HI>as Ouid affirmeth]</HI> and then againe at <HI>CVMAE</HI> where putting to land he goeth to <HI>Sibylla's</HI> caue, <HI>ANTRVM SIBYLLAE,</HI> and to <HI>A∣VERNVS</HI> lake <HI>(Lago di Tripergola)</HI> thence to the airie mount <HI>MISENVS, (Miseno)</HI> to <HI>CAIETA,</HI> King <HI>Lamus</HI> citie, at this day called <HI>Gaietta,</HI> and lastly to the riuer <HI>TIBRIS,</HI> where with seuen of his twentie ships remaining, he entreth, landeth his men and goods, and so endeth his seuen yeeres long and dangerous voyage, which we haue thus described, as you see partly out of <HI>Virgill, Ouid,</HI> and <HI>Lycophron,</HI> famous poets: and partly out of <HI>Liuy, Hali∣carnasseus, Pausanias,</HI> and <HI>Xenophon,</HI> as worthy renowmed historians.</P>
<P>But heere I cannot omit that which I haue read in <HI>Pausanias</HI> his Phocica, namely, that certaine of <HI>Aeneas</HI> his consorts, seuered and driuen from his company and the rest of the nauy by storme and tempest, did seat themselues in the ile <HI>SARDINIA.</HI> Item, it is worth the obseruation that <HI>Halicarnasse∣us</HI> and <HI>Liuy</HI> do iointly testifie, That <HI>Aeneas</HI> did not stay at <HI>Tibris,</HI> but at <HI>LAVRENTVM, (S. Laurentij,)</HI> and landed not with aboue sixe hundred men, as <HI>Solinus</HI> reporteth: which indeed seemeth somewhat more probable and like to be true: for that both by ancient histories and moderne experience, we finde that <HI>Tibris,</HI> the riuer which runneth by <HI>Rome,</HI> is not capable of a fleet or nauy of any bignesse. Therefore it is to be thought that the Poet fained this of his owne head, or els spake it in loue and commendations of this riuer. Neither was it a voyage of seuen yeeres, but of two at the most, as <HI>Halicarnasseus</HI> doth plainly affirme: <HI>Solinus</HI> out of <HI>Cassius Hemina</HI> auoucheth the same. There are some, as <HI>Strabo</HI> in the thirteenth booke of his Geography witnesseth, which do thinke all this voyage to be a fained tale and fiction of the Poets: and that <HI>Aeneas</HI> stayed still in <HI>Troy,</HI> and succeeded in the kingdome after his father, as likewise his childrens children did after him for many generations. Of this opinion <HI>Homer</HI> doth seeme to be. <HI>Xenophon</HI> in his booke of hunting, telleth this tale another way, where he writeth, That <HI>Aeneas</HI> manfully defending his father, and carefully preseruing the gods of his father and mother, gat himselfe a great reputation and credit amongst all sorts of men, for that his piety and religion; insomuch that euen the very enemies themselues, granted to him only, aboue all other which they had taken captiue in the surprizing of <HI>Troy,</HI> that in the sacking of the same no man should spoile or lay hand of ought that was his. Moreouer, that that his voyage vnto <HI>Carthage</HI> is not mentioned by any approoued historian, but fained by the poet, <HI>Macrobius</HI> doth plainly teach. Item, <HI>Appian,</HI> a writer of good credit, doth much discredit that story of his meeting and communication with Queene <HI>Dido,</HI> who writeth that <HI>CARTHAGE</HI> was built by the same <HI>Dido</HI> fiue hundred yeeres before the destruction of <HI>Troy.</HI> Againe, the graue historiographer <HI>Trogus,</HI> in his eighteenth booke doth make a relation of the life and death of this <HI>Dido</HI> or <HI>Eliza</HI> farre different from this. But the poet, as it seemeth, had a purpose to disgrace this citie and to strike a deepe impression of the fatall hatred which it alwayes bare towards the Romans, like as long before, <HI>Homer</HI> vnder the person of <HI>Helen</HI> had shewed how much the Greeks in heart did malice the Troians. Whereupon not vnfitly, I thinke, this Epigram of <HI>Ausonius</HI> which he wrote vpon the counterfet or picture of Queene <HI>Dido</HI> may heere to those former be adioined: <HI>Illa ego sum</HI> Dido <HI>vultu, quam conspicis hospes, Assimulata modis pulchra{que} miri∣ficis. Talis eram, fed non, Maro quam mihi finxit, erat mens: Vita nec incestis laeta cupidinibus. Nam{que} nec</HI> Aeneas <HI>vidit me</HI> Troius <HI>vnquam: Nec Libyam aduenit classibus Iliacis. Sed furias fugiens, atque arma procacis Iarbae, Seruaui, fateor, morte pudicitiam, Pectore transfixo: castos quod pertulit enses. Non furor, aut laeso crudus amore dolor, Sic cecidisse iuuat, vixi sine vulnere famae. Vlta virum, positis moenibus, oppetij. Inuida cur in me stimulasti Musa Maronem, Fingeret vt nostrae damna pudicitiae? Vos magis historicis, lectores, credite deme, Quàm qui furta Deum, concubitus{que} canunt. Falsidici vates: temerant qui carmine verum: Humanis{que} Deos assimilant vitijs.</HI> Which <HI>Priscian,</HI> or whosoeuer els he were, that was the authour of that ancient translation of <HI>Dionysius Afer,</HI> doth to the same sense, but in farre fewer words, vtter in those two verses: <HI>At{que} pudicitiam non perdit carmine falso, Quae regnans felix</HI> Dido <HI>per secula viuit.</HI> This fained tale, first forg'd in faithlesse poets braine, It neuer may, I trow, the honest fame distaine, Wherein thou <HI>Dido</HI> long didst liue amongst thine owne, And still of wiser sort thorowout the world is knowne.</P>

<HEAD>The PEREGRINATION of VLYSSES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He manifold wandring voiages of Vlysses (<HI>Errores,</HI> Ausonius in diuers places calleth them) were from all antiquity so fa∣mous and renowmed amongst all men, that <HI>The Peregrination of Vlysses,</HI> grew into a by-word, and to be spoken prouerbially of any hard and difficult trauell that any man did vndergoe, as Apuleius, in the second booke of his Golden Asse, doth testifie. Therefore for the benefite of the Readers and Students of that history, and at the earnest request of sundrie learned men, my friends, I haue thought good out of ancient Historians, to describe the <HI>twenty voyages</HI> of this famous Captaine, who, as Tzetzes writeth, with <HI>twelue shippes,</HI> set forward from <HI>TROY,</HI> (or, as the Greekes call it, <HI>Ilium,</HI>) a city of Troia or Troas, a prouince of Asia Minor, continually wandring vp and downe vntill at last he came to <HI>ITHACA,</HI> an iland in the Ionian sea, where hee was borne, now called, as Sophianus and others do testifie, <HI>Valle di Compare,</HI> or <HI>Teachi,</HI> as Porcacchius affirmeth; but of the Turkes <HI>Phiachi,</HI> as Leunclaw witnesseth. Therefore after the tenne yeares siege, taking and sacking of Troy by the Greekes, <HI>Vlysses</HI> or <HI>Odysseus</HI> as they call him, hauing a pur∣pose to returne home to his owne country, shipped himselfe and his company, put foorth to sea, and arriued within a few daies vpon the coast of the <HI>CICONES,</HI> a people of Thracia in Europe, whose chiefe city <HI>ISMARVS, (Zimarus,</HI> Dictys Cretensis falsly calleth it) hee sacked and spoiled. This city, as Suidas, Hesychius, and Tzetzes do testifie, was called <HI>MARONEA,</HI> now <HI>Marogna,</HI> as Sophianus and Niger both do peremptorily affirm, or, <HI>Marolia,</HI> as Leunclaw writeth. In Hyginus fables it is falsly written <HI>Marathonia.</HI> And that it should be amended &amp; written Ma∣ronea, it is very manifest, for that the wine wherewithall Vlysses afterward made the great lubber Polyphemus drunk was fetched from hence, as hee there writeth, and which Euripides in his Cyclops doth iustifie to be true. Moreouer <HI>Vinum Maroneum,</HI> the wine of Maronea, hath beene in old time much esteemed of and was as famous as any other sort whatsoeuer. Therefore after the sacke of this city, and as Suidas reporteth, Hecuba, ending her daies, neere the sea, being there intombed in stone in a place commonly called by the name of <HI>CYNOSSEMA,</HI> he was assaulted by the Cicones a sturdy and rough kind of people inhabiting amongst the mountaines of Thrace; and so by that meanes was forced with great losse and slaughter of his men to horse saile and put off to sea againe. And directing his course toward <HI>MALEA, (Cabo Malio,</HI> or <HI>S. Michaels wings)</HI> a promontory or foreland of Peloponnesus, the weather growing very foule, he was sore troubled and his ships rent and torne most grieuously, as Homer testifieth. But first it is very probable that he put into <HI>DELOS (Sdiles)</HI> an iland in the Archipelago, lying directly in his way, and where they write, that before the altar of Apollo, Vlysses saw a tall and slender <HI>Palme-tree</HI> grow: which, Cicero in his booke of Lawes affirmeth, was still to be seene in his time: and it is likely was the very same, which Pliny reporteth in his time had remained from the daies of Apollo. Homer also and Pausanias do speake of this palme tree. From <HI>Malea,</HI> he came to the ile <HI>CYTHERA (Cerigo)</HI> in the Ionian sea not farre from the coast of Peloponnesus, and from thence he went to the <HI>LOTOPHAGI.</HI> The <HI>Lotophagi,</HI> a kind of people which liue especially by the fruit of the lote tree, are by Historiographers placed in Africa, yea and that heere and there in diuerse and sun∣dry places of the same. But those Lotophagi vnto whom the consorts of this our Vlysses came, I am of opinion with Isaac Tzetzes, that they dwelt neere <HI>Hyperia,</HI> a city of Sicilia, or were next neighbours to <HI>Camarina,</HI> a city there still knowen by the name of Camarana. Neither can I bee perswaded that these Lotophagi are to be sought for in Africa: seeing that it is apparant euen out of Homer himselfe that the next day they went from the Lotophagi vnto the <HI>CYCLOPES,</HI> which out of Africa, so farre remote from Sicilia, they could by no meanes haue done. Item I haue Ausonius in his Periocha, vpon my side, who there testifieth that these Lotophagi did butte vpon the ile of the Cyclopes. Now almost all authours which haue written of this argu∣ment do iointly affirme that some of his consorts, much delighted with the sweetnesse and pleasant taste of the fruit of the Lote tree, staied heere still and would by no meanes euer returne backe againe. This I thought good, gentle Reader, to admonish thee of, lest thou shouldest in vaine in this our Mappe thinke to find any part of the continent of Africa. Moreouer in Pausanias I reade, that Vlysses in this his iourney did build the <HI>ATHFNEVM,</HI> that is, the chapell of Minerua, in Arcadia. From <HI>Cythera,</HI> he went to <HI>CACRA,</HI> a porte towne of Sicilia, which the forenamed Tzetzes testifieth was of him afterward named <HI>Vlyssis portus,</HI> Vlysses hauen, and had beene also sometime called <HI>Engyon,</HI> now knowen by the name of <HI>Longina.</HI> From hence hee went to the <HI>ILE</HI> of the Cyclopes, and so to the <HI>CAVE</HI> of Polyphemus; where he offered sacrifice and performed all due religious ceremonies vnto the gods, as Athenaeus testifieth. Now this <HI>Caue,</HI> as Vibius Sequester sheweth, was vpon the brinke of the riuer Acis, now called <HI>Freddo.</HI> Heere making Polyphemus drunke with the forenamed Maronean wine, and putting out his eies, he went vnto the <HI>AEOLIAE,</HI> or, as the Gods call them, the <HI>Planetae,</HI> certaine ilands continually casting foorth sparkles and flames of fire. Heere of Aeolus, king of these ilands, he had giuen him a bottle or bagge made of an oxe skin, wherein all the winds, but Zephyrus the West wind (or, if we may giue credit to Agatharchides, none but the North and South windes onely) were conteined and enclosed. For the West wind for those that saile with a strait course from Sicilia to Ithaca, is the best that can blow. With this pro∣sperous gale of wind, in nine daies, as Ouid reporteth, they comming within sight and kenning of the ile Ithaca, while Vlysses was asleepe, his consorts vp∣on the tenth day, as the foresaid authour writeth, opened the bagge, which they had alwaies hitherto beene verily perswaded was full of gold and siluer. By this meanes contrary winds and stormes arising, they are forced backe againe, and redoubling their course, (yet an ancient Lyricall Poet, saith it was but the bottle that went backe againe) to come the second time to the <HI>AEOLIAN ILANDS:</HI> where being by Aelous, as contemners of the Gods, and skorners of all religion, for bidden to land, they came vnto the <HI>LAESTRYGONES,</HI> a sauage people, that vsed to eat men, (like as they now write of the Canibals of America) who set vpon them, as enemies, neere to the city <HI>Lamus,</HI> and the fountaine <HI>Artacia.</HI> From hence with one ship onely (the other e∣leuen, as Ouid and Ausonius do testifie, being sunke by the Laestrygones) he came vnto the ile <HI>AE AE AE,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Circeia,</HI> (Hyginus in his fables doth falsly call <HI>Aena</HI>) the place of abode, where <HI>Circes,</HI> (called after her death, as Lactantius writeth, <HI>Marica</HI>) the daughter of Sol, or the Sunne, a woman famous for her Sorcery, passing skilfull in all maner of Magicke and witchcraft: by whose conduct and direction he went to <HI>AVERNVM,</HI> (Ce∣drenus nameth it <HI>Neciopa</HI>) a lake in Italy now called <HI>Lago di Tripergola;</HI> where amongst the soules that are in Purgatory <HI>(apud Inferos)</HI> hee hath conference with his mother Anticlia, and of her and by her meanes he vnderstood many things concerning his iourney that now he was to take. This done comming backe againe to <HI>Circeia,</HI> he found Elpenor one of his consorts whom he had left with Circes, as also Tiresias the wisard or sooth-saier, with di∣uerse other worthies and braue men, dead and buried. From thence he returned to the <HI>SVPERI,</HI> and entred there the <HI>Ocean.</HI> Lastly, he made a fu∣nerall and performed all ceremonies as he had promised to do, for his friend Elpenor, and withall built him a stately tombe. And thus much of that mat∣ter. Of this his nauigation through the vast Ocean, although many things by diuers authors are diuerslie reported: (as of <HI>Vlyssea,</HI> and <HI>Vlyssipona,</HI> certaine cities of Spaine, &amp;c. built by this our Vlysses: Of an altar in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> mentioned by Solinus, a prouince of Great Britaine, hauing an inscri∣ption vpon it written in Greeke letters, there consecrated and dedicated to some God whose gratious fauour he had largely tasted of in this his iourney: Of <HI>Asciburgium,</HI> a city built by him, as Tacitus writeth, vpon the brinke of the riuer Rheine, and of an altar there consecrated to his seruice:) yet that they are altogether fained and meere fables, there be many things that do strongly proue. And indeed Aulus Gellius, in the sixth chapter of his foureteenth booke, sheweth, that long since this voiage vpon the Ocean seas was doubted of and called in question: videlicet, they made a question whether Vlysses wandred through the maine Ocean, as Aristarchus would haue it: or whether he neuer went out of the inner sea, (so Strabo and Pliny do call the Medi∣terran or Midland sea) as Cratetes would perswade vs. And truely in Ausonius his Periocha there is not a word of this nauigation through the Ocean. Item, Vlysses himselfe relating vnto his wife the summe of all his peregrination, doth not once name the Ocean. Neither doth Dares Phrygius, Hyginus in his fables, or Isacius vpon Lycophron, mention any such thing: and yet euery one of these men doe make a large discourse of that his wandring voiage. Againe those things which we find in Strabo of this matter, as he himselfe plainly confesseth, were taken out of Possidonius, Artemidorus, and Asclepiades (euery one of which authours it is certaine liued many a day since Homer) and not out of Homer himselfe. Item, the wise Seneca in the <HI>88.</HI> chapter of his seuenth booke, calleth it <HI>Angustum iter &amp; errorem longum,</HI> A short iourney, but long in regard of many turne-againes, before it was ended. But because it was also before me, by the learned Iohn Brodey, a man of good iudgement and quicke conceit, accounted for a meere fable, I will heere, out of the third booke of his Miscellanea, set downe his opinion in his owne words, which in English are thus: They, saith he, who thinke that Vlysses euer sai∣led vpon the Maine Ocean, do labour to prooue that their opinion, out of this verse of Homer, in the tenth booke of his Odysses, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, But when thou shalt by ship haue pass'd the Ocean seas: Of which opinion although I do find the learned Strabo to bee, yet I see no reason, why I may not freely propose to the censure of the learned what I doe thinke of the same. When I doe consider the fashion and maner of building of

<PB REF="315"/> Vlysses shippes described by Homer, to be open, without deckes and hatches, I doe perceiue them to haue beene much too weake and too low, to abide the bil∣lowes and stormes of the maine sea: which for three moneths of the yeare galleies and tall shippes, well and strongly built of the best timber, and well seaso∣ned can hardly be able to sustaine. That any man should thinke that Astypyrgium, (or, Asciburgium, which wee spake of a little before) was built by Vlysses, as some men haue gathered out of Cornelius Tacitus, it were extreame madnesse. For if one would passe the Spanish, French and English seas, and then at length to returne backe againe through the Germane Ocean, and in diuers places, on Gods name, vpon the sea coast to build and erect altars, he had need haue a nauy of many tal ships strongly built &amp; wel appointed, he must not think to do it with one little bark or rotten barge rowed to &amp; fro with oares and strength of men. But authours of good credit do make mention of Vlyssipo, and of other famous monuments of him to be seene in Portugall. What then? Whether that any thing of Vlysses his doing be there to be seene or euer were I greatly doubt: and if there be, yet that it was made by this Vlysses, whose life &amp; famous acts Homer did describe, I flatly deny. And yet it is not incredible to beleeue, that as we do suppose that there were many Herculesses, so that there were in like maner more Vlyssesses then one: which in mine opinion seemeth very probable and likely to be true. Thus farre Brodey. To those arguments of his I adde, first, That Odyssopolis is; by Cedrenus and the Historia Miscella, described, to be neere Pontus in Asia. And who is so madde to beleeue that this city was so named of this our Odyssus or as the Latines call him Vlysses? And seeing that I do see that Homer himselfe doth not make mention of any one place vnto the which he did put in or landed in all this his trauel vpon the Ocean sea: I am easily perswaded that this notable Poet doth, not only in this verse, but euen in diuers other places also by the Ocean, poetically mean the sea. For example, neere the end of the <HI>10.</HI> book of his Odys¦ses &amp; ni the beginning of the <HI>11.</HI> assoone as euer he is returned from the <HI>Inferi,</HI> presently Homer maketh him to enter the Ocean. But you will say he entred the Ocean, neere wherabout the <HI>Cimmerij</HI> did dwell, as appeareth plainly by that which he writeth in the beginning of the <HI>12.</HI> book of his Odysses: True. But where I pray you, did these <HI>Cimmerij</HI> dwell? No where surely, but in Italy, within a little of the ile Circeia, &amp; being returned from thence, he burieth, according to his promise, the body of Elpenor. The body I mean, after so many moneths, or, which is more probable, so many yeres (for those nauigations in old time were not the next way through the middest of the sea, but much further about, as we haue shewed in our Thesaurus at the word <HI>OPHIR,</HI> along by the shore within sight of land) corrupt, or, which is more likely turned to dust and ashes, or quite consumed to nothing. If any man shall againe obiect (with Ouid in the first booke of his Tristium, who saith that <HI>illius pars maxima ficta laborum est:</HI> The most part of Vlysses toile, was forged in Poets braine) and say that this whole history, and not only this nauigation vpon the Maine Ocean, was but a feined tale. I answer, that all the story, except this part of his nauigation by the vast Ocean only, is somewhat probable, and nothing in it impossible but might haue beene done. In this voiage by the Ocean sea, I haue stated the longer, lest the Reader might suspect that either through negligence or ignorance it were left out in this our Mappe. Now let vs, if you please, go on forward with our intended iourney. Vlysses departing from the iland <HI>Aeaea,</HI> and taking his leaue of his hostesse Circes, by whom, hauing kept with her by the space of an whole yeare, he begat his sonne Telegonus, he went his way safe and sound. For Mercury had giuen him the hearb <HI>Mo∣ly</HI> (so the Gods do call it) a sure antidote and preseruatiue against all maner of inchantments and witchcraft. And sailing along by the <HI>SIRENVM IN∣SVLAE, (the Mirmaides ilands)</HI> he built the temple of Minerua <HI>(Fanum Mineruae)</HI> in <HI>CAMPANIA</HI> in Italy, as Strabo writeth. In this tract also, videlicet, in <HI>LVCANIA,</HI> as the same authour recordeth, he built the chapell of Draco <HI>(Sacellum Draconis)</HI> one of his companions in that his voiage. From thence he sailed along by the shore, and at length landed at <HI>TENESSA,</HI> a city of the Bruttij; (Isacius vpon Lycophronfalsly writeth, that he landed in England, mistaking <HI>Britannos,</HI> for <HI>Bruttios,</HI> or ignorantly confounding <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> with <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:) as Pausanias hath left recorded: Item, Suidas out of Pausanias affirmeth the same, but withall he addeth that heere one of the sailers did rauish a virgin, and for that vild act was by the townesmen stoned to death. Neere to this towne the chapell of Politas, <HI>(Fanum Politae)</HI> one of Vlysses consorts, by Strabo is described to haue stood. From hence it is likely out of Pliny, that he came to the iles <HI>ITHACEIAE,</HI> or, as otherwise they are called, <HI>Vlysses specula,</HI> that is, Vlysses beacon or lanterne. From hence setting forward, and warily auoiding the dangerous <HI>Scylla,</HI> and <HI>Charybdes,</HI> (although not altogether without the losse of some of his company) he came againe into <HI>TRINACRIA,</HI> or the Iland of the Sunne, <HI>(Insula Solis)</HI> twise, as Horace saith, or as Ausonius writeth, often losing his way, and failing of his course: where while he himselfe was asleep, some of his company killed certaine sheep of Sol, the gouernour of that place, out of his flocke, which, as Appianus Alexandrinus in the fifth booke of his Ciuill warres writeth, did feed neere Artemisium, a towne in Sicilia, which Barrius at this day thinketh to be called <HI>Agatha:</HI> for which their villanie and foule act committed by them, they were all cast away and sunke. Vlysses himselfe alone, getting vp vpon the mast of the ship, escaped and was carried into the ile <HI>OGYGIA,</HI> where hee dwelt seuen yeares, as Homer writeth, or six yeare, as Ouid testifieth: or tenne yeares, as Seruius would make vs beleeue, with the Nymph Calypso, by whom he gate his sonne Auson. After all this, building a ship with his owne hands, he shippeth himselfe and setteth saile all alone, for meere naturall loue of his country (preferring it before im∣mortality, which the goddesse had promised if so be he would stay with her) committing himselfe to the sea, out alas he feeleth againe the second time the waight of Neptunes wrath, for that, as we haue shewed before, he had put out the eies of his sonne Polyphemus. For the eighteenth (or, as Ouid writeth, the eightith) day after his first setting out, when as he came so neere Ithaca, that he might easily descry the smoke of the chimneies (mark the crosse lucke) tempestuous winds and raging stormes do on euery side arise, so that his ship was ouerturned, and himselfe throwen into the sea, but, as God would haue it, rising againe instantly he caught hold of the ship. The Nymph Leucothea, (<HI>Nausicaa,</HI> others call her) seeing him thus toiled and wandring in the mid∣dest of the sea, tooke compassion vpon him, and presently relieued him: she aduiseth him to let go the ship, to put off his apparell, and to commit himselfe naked to the sea only; and withall she giueth him her fillet or haire-lace wherewith her head was bound vp: which he tying about his middle, swom vntill he came vnto the country of the <HI>PHAEACES,</HI> (Cedrenus, falsly, hath Phoenices) where he arriued neere vnto the riuer Callirhoë. The foresaid Ce∣drenus writeth that he was carried from hence into <HI>Creta</HI> to Idomeneus; and by him conuieghed thence into <HI>Corcyra,</HI> vnto Alcinous. But let vs pro∣ceed. With this fillet of Leucothea, he being tied vnto the ship and hanging at it, (except heere Philostratus which is ordinary with him, doe tell a tale,) with his owne strength, vsing his hande in steed of oares, he swomme through the middest of the sea. Yet that the shippe came thus farre and further, it seemeth out of Pliny to be not altogether improbable: because he writeth that about Phalacrum, a promontory or foreland of Phaeacia, or Corcyra, this ship was turned into a rocke: which rocke Martianus saith is in fashion and proportion like a ship: although falsly hee in that place calleth this foreland Phalarium for Phalacrum. But if any man shall say that he doth requite one tale with another, I will not greatly gainsay him. From Phaeacia, by Alci∣nous king of that country, who had most honourably intertained him, he was at length conueighed to <HI>Ithaca</HI> his natiue country, whose smoake he had ma∣ny times and often desired before this to see. Where killing the woers, which were in number, if one may beleeue Athenaeus, an hundred and eight, or as Dictys Cretensis saith but thirty onely, he embraceth and kindly saluteth his louing wife Penelope. And this is the end of all these wandring peregrina∣tions, in which, as Ouid saith, <HI>Iactatus dubio per duo lustra mari:</HI> Tenne yeares he wandred vp and downe in seas vnknowen. Signifying that the rest of the yeares were spent in trauels and troubles endured vpon the land. Of which the same authour also thus speaketh, <HI>Ille breui spatio multis errauit in annis, Inter Dulichias Iliacas{que} domos.</HI> In trauell many yeares he spent, his iourney was not farre, Betweene the iland Zante and Troy, that fa∣mous towne of warre. Isacius vpon Lycophron testifieth that Vlysses, by the counsell of Minerua, went to <HI>TRAMPYA,</HI> a city of the Eurytanes, a people of Epyrus or Aetolia, there to offer sacrifice vnto the Gods: and withall this our authour there addeth, that these people are the very same that Homer in the eleuenth booke of his Odysses speaketh of in these words, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, vntill hee came amongst those men, that ne'r heard tell of Ocean sea. Againe the same authour moreouer affirmeth that in this city Vlysses was worshipped as a god, and that hee had an oracle there. Not farre from hence amongst these people also Stephanus placeth the city <HI>BVNIMA,</HI> first founded by Vlysses. That he was reuerenced as a god, I do find by a certaine speech of Seneca that he vseth of him vnto Serenus: and therefore it is no maruell that he should giue foorth answers and oracles. And that I may omit nothing of his labours, Dares Phrygius amongst diuers other of his dangerous attempts writeth that hee put in to harborough at <HI>MONVCHA.</HI> Cassiodorus in the twelfth booke of his <HI>Variar.</HI> writeth that the towne <HI>SCYLLACIVM</HI> was also built by him. That he erected a chap∣pell vpon the toppe of mount <HI>BOREVS</HI> in Peloponnesus, to Neptune and Minerua Sospita, I do find in Pausanias his: Arcadica. Apollodorus, as Strabo citeth, writeth that Vlysses in this his voiage came to the ile <HI>CANNVS,</HI> but which this should be I know not. For of this name there are diuers, as thou shalt find in our Thesaurus. And peraduenture it is not vnlikely to be true, that Vlysses was tossed to and fro to diuers and sundry places; which Era∣tosthenes, as Strabo alledgeth, saith he will then find out, when it shalbe his chance to meet with the cobler which sewed the bottell wherein he carried the windes which Aeolus gaue him. And thus much generally of the wandring voiage of this Captaine, which happened to him as he passed <HI>inter Dulichi∣as Iliacasque domos,</HI> Betweene the iland Zante and famous Troy, as Ouid reporteth. <HI>Sed perlege Odysseam omnia nosse volens,</HI> But read o're learned Homers workes, He telleth this tale at large: as Ausonius in his Epitaphs counselleth. Yet of this our Vlysses I cannot with silence passe ouer that of Plutarch in his Morals; namely, for that he had killed those Suters, it was by Neoptolemus decreed against him that hee must leaue his country and be seene no more in Ithaca, Dulichium and Zacynthus. So that in this his banishment he went againe into <HI>Italy.</HI> But where he left his life, it is vncer∣taine.
<PB REF="315"/> Isacius vpon Lycophron, an authour oft cited by vs, affirmeth out of Theopompus, that hee died in <HI>GORTYNIA,</HI> a city of Tyrrhenia in Italy. Yet Dictys Cretensis toward the latter end of his sixth booke (whom also thou maiest read if thou thinkest good) saith, that he died in <HI>ITHACA.</HI> All men for the most part generally report, that he was slaine vnawares by his sonne Telegonus (holding still in his hand a cuppe, as Athenaeus telleth the tale) with an iron dart, headed by his mother Circe, with a puffens quill <HI>(pastinaca marina,</HI> they call it) but for another purpose, as Oppianus in the second booke of his Halieutica writeth, namely to kill his enemy, not his father. Hyginus in the <HI>127.</HI> fable recordeth that assoone as he was dead hee was carried into the ile Aeaeato Circe, and was there by her interred. Some there are, as Isacius testifieth, that do report that Circe by her sorceries restored him a∣gaine to his former life. More peraduenture might haue beene said of this our Vlysses, if Cratinus Comicus, whom Athenaeus reporteth to haue written <HI>De Vlyssibus,</HI> were now extant and to be gotten. Notwithstanding, after this larger discourse of the wandring voyage of this famous Captaine, I thinke it not amisse to speake a word or two of Vlysses himselfe, because I verily perswade my selfe that it cannot but bee a matter that the Reader will very well like of. In a certaine siluer coine or piece of money of Caius Mamilius Limetanus, who, as the report goeth, (thus testifieth Liuy) was lineally descended from Vlysses, and the goddesse Circe, was stamped vpon one side the head of Mercury, and therefore it had, as is very probable, on the other side the sig∣net or counterfet of Vlysses: which may be easily prooued out of those particulars and testimonies that doe heereafter follow. Plutarch in the life of Cato the Elder, doth giue out that Vlysses had a purpose to haue gone backe againe to the caue of Polyphemus, for no other cause but to demand his Cappe and Girdle, which there he had left behind him &amp; forgotten. Therfore, it is here hence apparant that he did vsually weare a Cap and a Girdle. Yet we reade in Pliny that Nicomachus the painter did first paint Vlysses with a cappe vpon his head. And to be painted wearing a Cappe was a cognisance and badge of nobility, as Soranus in the life of Hippocrates doth plainly affirme: item, Dion Prusaeus in his foureteenth oration seemeth to intimate as much. Again, by an ancient custome of the old Romanes they were woont by putting on a Cappe vpon a mans head, to make those that were slaues, free. Whereupon they vsed this phrase of speech <HI>Ad pileum vocare,</HI> To call a man to the Cappe, for <HI>Ad libertatem vocare,</HI> To make one a freeman. That this Cappe af Vlys∣ses was in fashion round, it is manifest out of these words of Saint Hierome, <HI>Rotundum pileolum, quale in Vlysseo conspicimus,</HI> A round Cappe, such a like one as we do see vpon the counterfet of Vlysses. I may also adde this one thing although somewhat farre fetched, That they were called <HI>Pileati,</HI> as Iornandes testifieth, which amongst the Goths were accounted of greater birth and nobility, or of deeper reach and experience then the common sort of men were of, because they went with their heads couered with a kinde of bonnet or cappe. Moreouer he carried in his hand a staffe, wherewith he staid him∣selfe where the waies were slippery, and defended himselfe from such as in his trauell did assault or molest him; as Homer testifieth of him in the fourteenth booke of his Odysses. He had also a dog, as the same authour affirmeth, which after twenty yeares absence, at his returne home knew his master. Now the name of this dogge, as we read in the same authour, was Argus. Which also Plutarch, in his booke of the tranquillity of the mind, doth auouch to be true. And withall addeth this moreouer, that he wept for his dogge when he died. Pausanias in his <HI>Phocicis,</HI> describeth this our Vlysses with a corslet or coat-armor vpon his backe. Homer in the fifteenth booke of his Odysses saith that he was bald or very thinne haired. Which is to be vnderstood of his latter daies when he grew in yeares. For Suidas out of the aforesayd authour sheweth, that his haire was blacke and curled. Beside that, he saith that he was somewhat hog-backed or stoup-shouldred. That he bare in his shield or scutcheon a Dolphin, and why, thou maist read in Plutarch in his book of the Com∣parison of liuing creatures. But some man may aske me, why Mercury, wearing a broad brimmed hatte, with his verge or mace in his hand, was stamped vpon the backeside of Vlysses coine? If it be lawfull for me to gesse and interpose mine opinion, I answer, For the especiall and singular loue and fauour of this God aboue the rest, shewed at sundrie times toward this braue Captaine. For when in that his peregination all the Gods well neere were set and opposed against him, only Mercury was found to fauour him and to sticke close vnto him. For he only gaue him an antidote or preseruatiue against the sorceries and inchantments of the mischieuous witch Circe. And indeed we read that this God of all others was wont especially to be honoured in any maner of magicall seruices whatsoeuer, as we may see in the fourth booke of Papirius his Thebaidos. Item, of this God he obtained leaue to depart, and that he might bee no longer detained by the nymph Calypso &amp;c. And peraduenture there may be also another cause assigned; namely for that Vlysses, whom Homer and other authours do highly commend for a most eloquent oratour, and one that could speake most wisely and to the purpose in any kind of matter, did take this god Mercury (whom the Gentiles did make the president of orators and eloquence) for his guardian and protector, thinking thereby to bind him so much the more neerely vnto him. Pausanias saith that in <HI>Motya,</HI> a city of Sicilia there was the statue or counterfet of this our Vlysses, but by Nero the Emperour it was from thence transported to Rome in Italy. And thus much of this braue Captaine, <HI>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit &amp; vrbes,</HI> who, as the Poet writeth of him, saw many mens maners and knew many cities. Of whom also thus speaketh Ouid, <HI>Si minùs errasset, notus minùs esset Vlysses?</HI> If great Vlysses had not strai'd, he had beene more obscure. But of him I will speake no more: lest peraduenture with the Grammarians, I bee hit in the teeth with that of Diogenes: who said that while they did search diligently to know all the crosses and euils that befell Vlysses, did forget their owne. And moreouer that worthy admonition of wise Seneca, where he saith, <HI>Quid proderit inquirere vbi Vlysses errauerit, quàm ne nos semper erremus?</HI> What shall it auaile vs to seeke where and which way Vlysses wandred, more then to restraine vs that we do not in like maner alwaies wander as he did? And now it is high time to take penne from paper. As for those coines which we haue spoken of before, I wish thee to repaire to Goltzius and others which haue at large and peculiarly handled that argument.</P>

<HEAD>A description of the RED SEA, now vulgarly called, <HI>The</HI> INDIAN SEA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>ARE ERYTHRAEVM,</HI> or, as the Latines call it, <HI>MARE RVBRVM, The Red Sea,</HI> which heere we offer to thy view in this Mappe, for as much as we can gather out of ancient writers, stretcheth it selfe from the West, as Liuy writeth along by the coast of A∣frica or Aethiopia, euen vnto India in East, yea and beyond that, I know not how farre, as Arrianus testifieth: whereupon Ptolemey, Pliny and Melado call it <HI>MARE INDICVM, The Indian Sea.</HI> But Herodotus calleth it <HI>MARE PERSICVM, The Persian Sea.</HI> Which Pliny doth seeme to iustifie to be true, where he saith, That the Persians do dwell along by the coast of the Red Sea, between the coast of Africa, and the iland Taprobana. Strabo that worthy Geographer, he calleth it <HI>MARE MAGNVM, The Great sea,</HI> who moreouer doth affirme it to be a part of the Atlanticke sea, and that truly. A part of this sea, to wit, where it toucheth the coast of that Aethiopia which lieth beneath Aegypt, Pliny, of the countrie Azania (which at this day some do thinke to bee called <HI>Xoa</HI>) nameth it <HI>MARE AZANIVM.</HI> Where it ioineth with the Bay of Arabia, it is of Ptolemey named <HI>HIPPADIS PELAGVS,</HI> now called of some <HI>Archiplago di Maldiuar.</HI> Item, of the same Ptolemey it is otherwise called <HI>BARBARICVS SINVS, The Barbarian bay:</HI> I meane in that place where it beateth vpon Aethiopia, and the iland Menuthesia, now of the seamen generally called, <HI>The iland of Saint Laurence,</HI> but of that country people <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and of Theuet <HI>Alba∣gra.</HI> There are two Baies or Gulfes, as the Italians and Spaniards terme them, of this sea much talked of in all ancient histories: to wit, <HI>SINVS PER∣SICVS, The Persian Bay,</HI> and <HI>SINVS ARABICVS, The Arabian Bay,</HI> which some, not well read in old writers, do for the most part call <HI>Ma∣re Rubrum,</HI> The Red Sea. Very improperly, being indeed but a part of that sea, properly called the Red sea, which we haue hitherto spoken of. But why it was of the Greekes named <HI>Erythraeum,</HI> and of the Latines <HI>Rubrum,</HI> Red, it is a great question amongst the learned not yet decided. Some there are which do deeme it to haue beene called, The Red Sea, of the colour of the water: but this, of all late writers, trauellers, seamen, and other eie-witnesses of good credit, which haue in this our age, &amp; euery day do saile through this Sea, &amp; haue diligently viewed the same, is improued and found to be altogether false. Moreouer Qu. Curtius amongst the ancients doth plainly testifie that it differeth no whit in colour from other seas. Some there are as Pliny writeth, which do thinke that, by reason of the reuerberation of the Sunne beames, it seemeth to cast vp such a like colour to the sight of the beholders. Others doe thinke that this is caused by reason of the colour of the sand or earth in the bottom of the same: others do affirm it to be the very nature of the water. Some do write that it was so named of king Erythrus, Perseus sonne, whose tombe, as Quintus Curtius writeth, did in his time remaine in a certaine iland of this sea not farre distant from the maine land: (Strabo calleth this iland, <HI>Tyrina:</HI> Pliny and Pomponius Mela, <HI>Ogyris:</HI> Arrianus, <HI>Oaracta:</HI>) or else of a certaine Persian named Erythras, as the forenamed Strabo giueth out. Who, as Pliny with him testifieth, in a small barke or barge first sailed through this sea and discouered the same. Which story also is at large handled by Agatarchides. Yet our authour calleth him Hippalus, who first found out the course to saile through the middest of this sea. Pliny by that name calleth the wind by which they make their iourneis through this sea. (So called as is ve∣ry probable of the inuentour.) Which wind the same authour in the thirteenth chapter of his <HI>6.</HI> booke, maketh the same that Fauonius is vnto the Latines. Mela &amp; Agatarchides do call it a tempestuous, stormy, rough and deepe sea. Pliny, Philostratus, Elianus, &amp; Athenaeus do giue it the title of <HI>Margaritife∣rum,</HI>
<PB REF="316"/> the pearle-bearing sea. And the same Pliny maketh it <HI>Arboriferum,</HI> a tree-bearing sea. For he writeth in the fiue and twentieth chapter of his thirteenth booke, that it is full of groues and tall woods: the toppes of whose high trees he affirmeth are seene much aboue the waters, and therfore at high tide they vse to fasten their shippes vnto the toppes, and at the ebbe vnto the roots of the same. Item, the same authour, in the two and twentieth chapter of the sixth booke of his Naturall historie, writeth that about Colaicum, (which also is called Colchi) or as Solinus affirmeth about Tapobrana, an iland not farre hence, the sea is of a very greenish colour, and so full of trees that their toppe boughes are barked and brushed with the rudders or sterne of those ships that saile this way. Moreouer that trees do grow in this sea Megasthenes, out of Antigonus <HI>de Mirabilibus,</HI> doth affirme, which Plutarch in his Naturall questions, and againe in his booke <HI>de facie Lunae,</HI> doth auouch to be true: where he doth particularly nominate some of them, to wit, Oliue-trees, Bay-trees, and Plocamus, which otherwise they call Isidis Capillus. This also Strabo in the sixth booke of his Geography iustifieth to be true: so doth the forenamed Pliny, who teacheth vs that it is a plant much like to corall without leaues. Agatarchides saith that it resembleth much the blacke rush. Athenaeus out of Philonides the Physician writeth, that the vine was first brought from the Redde-sea and planted in Greece. In the eigth chapter of the fourth booke of Theophrastus his history of plants, you may reade of diuerse other kinds of trees and herbs which do naturally grow in this sea. Pom∣ponius sheweth, that this sea hath more and greater monsters that do liue and breed in it then any other sea in the world beside. Quintus Curtius affir∣meth that it is full of whales, <HI>(balaenae)</HI> of such an huge bignesse that they are in bulke equall to the greatest shippes or vessels that are. Solinus saith that one of them will couer two akers of ground. The same authour doth there describe vnto vs certaine blew wormes, which haue their forelegges not lesse then six foot long. These are of that wonderfull strength that oft times they do with their clawes lay hold vpon Elephants comming thitherto drinke, and by maine force pull them into the sea. Item, he telleth of certaine whirle-pooles, <HI>Physeteras,</HI> he calleth them, of that huge bignesse, that they are to see to like vnto great and massie columnes, these doe many times raise themselues vp as high as the crosse-mast, from whence they spout out such abundance of water out of their gullets, that oft times by the violence of the storme the vessels of those which saile and passe by that way are sunke and cast away. Strabo hath left in writing, that Amazenas, the admirall of the Indian fleet, did there see a whale of fifty foot in length. Arrianus in his Indica describeth cer∣taine <HI>balaenas,</HI> whales or whirlepooles, of an huge and wonderfull bignesse, with three sorts of great and terrible kind of Serpents, which as Solinus wri∣teth will couer more then two akers of lands. It is recorded by Pliny that the Hydri, certaine sea-monsters of twenty cubites in length, did much affright the nauy of Alexander the Great. Item, he telleth of torteises of such a maruellous bignesse, that the shell of one of them will make a couer for a prettie house: and againe, That they vsually do saile in these shels vpon this sea, like as they vse in other countries in shippes and boates. Yea, as Agatarchides affirmeth, these fishes do serue those which dwell vpon this sea coast, instead of houses, boats, dishes and meat. About the iland Taprobana, now called as generally all learned do thinke, Samotra, there are certaine fishes, which do liue partly vpon sea and partly vpon land, whereof some are like oxen, others like horses, and other some are like other foure footed beasts, as Strabo in his fifteenth and sixteenth bookes hath left recorded. And thus much of the name, situation and nature of this Redde-sea, which Liuy in his <HI>45.</HI> booke tearmeth, <HI>Finem terrarum,</HI> The outmost bound of the world. He that desi∣reth to know more of this sea, let him haue recourse to Agatarchides and Arrianus in his Indica. Item, let him consult with Baptista Ramusio, who tran∣slated this <HI>Periplus,</HI> or discouery, into the Italian tongue, and hath enlarged the same with a discourse, as hee calleth it, of his owne, of the same argu∣ment. And I would wish him not to omit Stuckius, who also translated the same into the Italian tongue, and hath illustrated it with his most learned and laborious Commentaries. Lastly, Athenaeus in the fourteenth booke of his Deipnosophiston, maketh me beleeue that Pythagoras that great and famous Philosopher, did write a booke of the Redde sea.</P>

<HEAD>HANNO'S PERIPLVS, OR, Discouery of the Atlanticke Seas and Coasts of Africa.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Periplus of Hanno king of Carthage, was first translated out of Greeke into Latine by Conradus Gesnerus, a man that hath very well deserued of all sorts of scholars &amp; succedent ages, &amp; hath illustrated the same with his most learned and painfull Commentaries. But before him Baptista Ramusio turned it into the Tuscane tongue, and hath to it adioined a discourse, as he termeth it. Of the ancient writers Pomponius Mela in the second chapter of his third booke, &amp; Pliny in the first chapter of the fift book of his history of Nature, who there calleth him a captaine of Carthage, not king of Cathage, haue made mention of this Periplus or Discouery. But he calleth this discourse by the name of Commentaries, not of a Periplus. The same Pliny in the one and thirtieth chapter of his sixth booke calleth him an Emperour. Yet Solinus in the last chapter of his worke, out of Xenophon Lampsacenus, maketh as if hee had beene a king of the Poeni. Arrianus also toward the latter end of his Indian stories mentioneth this Periplus. Moreouer Pliny in the sixteenth chapter of the eighteenth booke of his Naturall historie, and Aelianus in the fiftieth chapter of his fifth booke <HI>De Animalibus,</HI> do make mention of one Hanno, who was the first man that euer was heard of in the world that durst handle, and take vpon him to tame a Lion. But whether he be the same with this our Hanno, I am not able to determine. For there haue beene many of that name: of which, if any man be desirous to know more, let him repaire to the Commentaries of the forenamed Gesner, which he wrot vpon this Periplus. These words in Pliny and Martianus in very deed are meant of another Hanno, diuers from this of whom wee haue hitherto spoken. Hanno, say they, at such time as the Punicke Empire stood in flourishing estate, sailed round about by the coast of Barbary, and so from thence South-ward all along by the shore, vntill at length after a long and tedious iourney he came to the coasts of Arabia. More∣ouer that student that is desirous to know more of this Periplus or Discouery, may adde to these collections of ours, such things as Iohn Mariana hath writ∣ten of it, in the latter end of his first booke of his history of Spaine.</P>

<HEAD>ARGONAVTICA, That is, IASONS voyage for the GOLDEN FLEECE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here is none almost of the ancients which hath not as it were by the way touched the story of the ARGONAVTES, that is, of IASON, or of the GOLDEN FLEECE: but amongst those which of set purpose haue handled that matter as <HI>Cleon, Herodotus, Pisander, Dionysius, Milesius, Varro At∣tacinus,</HI> and <HI>Epimenides</HI> (who, as <HI>Laertius</HI> recordeth, set out the same at large in 6500. verses) there are only three remaining at this day, that haue come to our handes; namely, <HI>Valerius Flaccus, Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Apollonius Rhodius.</HI> In all which three, the iourney foorth-ward of those Argo∣nautes (that is, of <HI>Iason</HI> and his consorts which sailed with him in the ship named the <HI>Argo</HI>) is reasonably alike described, but in the returne of them homeward they differ very much one from another in their relations: For <HI>Flaccus</HI> bringeth them backe from <HI>Colchis,</HI> by the North shore of the <HI>Euxine sea, (Mar maiore)</HI> and so vnto the mouth of the riuer <HI>Ister</HI> or <HI>Danubius (Done</HI> or <HI>Donaw)</HI> and there he leaueth them; being preuented by death, as he peraduenture supposed. <HI>Apollonius</HI> bringeth him vp against the streame of the said riuer, and so out of it by the riuer <HI>Sabus (Saw)</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Trogus</HI> do thinke, into the Hadriaticke and Ionian seas: not farre off from <HI>Tergeste (Trieste,</HI> in <HI>Friuli)</HI> but as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, they were forced out of the way by the riuer <HI>E∣ridanus (Po)</HI> into <HI>Rhodanus (Rhosne)</HI> vnto the <HI>Stoechades (Isles de hyerres)</HI> certaine ilands in the Ligusticke sea <HI>(Mar di Leone)</HI> ouer-against <HI>Narbone</HI> in <HI>France:</HI> out of which sailing through the Midland and Aegean seas, they came safe home to the place from whence they first set out. But <HI>Orpheus</HI> he telleth the story with a farre greater circumstance, and maketh them to fetch a larger compasse about, namely, by the riuer <HI>Tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (Don)</HI> and that huge wood (as he calleth it) or endlesse, as <HI>Dionysius Afer</HI> termeth it: and that not without iust cause: for I deeme it to be the greatest wood of the whole world that yet to vs is descried. (These latter ages call'd by one proper name <HI>Orcynium,</HI> or <HI>Hercynia.</HI>) Then by the North sea, called of them <HI>Croni∣um</HI> (named by <HI>Seneca</HI> in his tragedie, intituled <HI>Medea, Vrsae vetitum mare</HI>) and by the Atlanticke sea vnto <HI>Hercules pillars</HI> (the streights of <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) compassing round all <HI>Europe,</HI> came at last home safe againe to their owne houses. This voyage there∣fore we haue in this our Mappe, framed out of those three forenamed authours: which will easily and plainly appeare to him that shall examine the same with the stories set downe by them. Beside those places named by them, we haue added certaine other, out of other authours, neuer touched by them, yet pertaining to this their purpose: as namely, <HI>Salmydessus</HI> in <HI>Thracia,</HI> where <HI>Apollodorus</HI> saith they landed or put into harborough. <HI>Item, AEmonia,</HI> a towne built by the Argonautes in that place where they laying the <HI>Argo,</HI> their ship, vpon ingines [their shoulders, as <HI>Pindarus</HI> and <HI>Trogus</HI> haue giuen out, and so <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, the best authours affirme] caried it from the shore 400. furlongs: or, which is all one, 50. miles, euen vnto the coastes of the <HI>Thessalians (Italians, Zozomen</HI> readeth: differing in word and maner of writing, not in truth of story: for they were Thessalians by birth and parentage, now seated in the land of <HI>Italy</HI>) as we find recorded in <HI>Zosimus</HI> and others. There is the city <HI>Pola,</HI> a worke begun and perfected by the <HI>Colchi,</HI> who, being sent to pursue <HI>Medea,</HI> vp to the riuer <HI>Done, (Ister)</HI> vp as high as the ilands then called <HI>Absyrtides,</HI> where, being frustrate of their purpose, they staid: and of the riuer <HI>Ister,</HI> vp which they sailed: they called the country through which it runneth <HI>Istria. Phla,</HI> or if you please <HI>Phila,</HI> an iland in the lake <HI>Triton,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> where <HI>Herodotus</HI> writeth that <HI>Iason</HI> arriued, and the North wind blowing stiffe against him was driuen to <HI>Malea,</HI> a promontory or foreland of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and there to haue giuen his <HI>tripos,</HI> (or <HI>treuet</HI>) to <HI>Triton. Polybius</HI> saith, That <HI>Iason</HI> built a temple at <HI>Bosphorus Thracius (Stretto di Constantinopoli,</HI> the streights of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> the Greekes call it <HI>Laimon,</HI> the Turkes, <HI>Bogazin</HI>) and that to the honour of <HI>Neptune,</HI> as <HI>Pindarus</HI> reporteth: where he also consecrated twelue altars for those seruices and sacrifices. This selfe same Temple <HI>Demosthenes</HI> nameth the Temple of the Argonautes. In <HI>Pau∣sanias</HI> and <HI>Varro,</HI> we read that the same <HI>Iason</HI> dedicated a Temple to <HI>Iuno,</HI> in the ile <HI>Samos, (Samo.) Item,</HI> to <HI>Iuno Argiua in agro Picentino, (Principato,</HI> or <HI>Costa de Ainalfe)</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> hath left recorded. And that hee erected altars neere the riuer <HI>Ister, (Done</HI> or <HI>Donaw)</HI> where it diuideth it selfe into two streames, emptying his waters partly into <HI>Pontus (Mar maiore)</HI> and partly into <HI>Adria,</HI> (the Gulfe of <HI>Venice) Aristotle</HI> teacheth in his <HI>Admiranda.</HI> I suppose he meant this of the <HI>Caucasian rockes, (Caucasij scopuli.)</HI> Fabulous antiquity verily beleeued that the riuer <HI>Ister</HI> had issue out into the <HI>Hadriaticke sea.</HI> Perad∣uenture mooued by that which <HI>Pliny</HI> in the fifteenth chapter of his fourth booke, hath most fabulously written, that certaine fish called Tunies, breed in the Euxine sea, <HI>(Pontus Euxinus Mar maiore)</HI> do swimme vp the riuer <HI>Ister,</HI> and from thence do passe, by secret passages vnder the ground into the Hadriaticke sea. And thus farre of this gadding and rouing voiage by sea, which from their first setting forward vntill their returne, as <HI>Apollodorus</HI> reporteth out of ancient recordes, was performed in the space of foure moneths. Which in my iudgement seemeth not very probable: I beleeue he dreamed when he wrote this storie. For so many moneths would scarce be sufficient for one to saile vp the riuer <HI>Ister,</HI> against the streame, from his mouth where it falleth into <HI>Mar maiore,</HI> vnto <HI>Tergeste, (Trieste)</HI> vpon the Gulfe of <HI>Venice,</HI> much lesse could they be able in so short a space to go so long and tedious a iourney as this was described to be. More true and likely by farre are those wordes of <HI>Hypsipula</HI> to <HI>Iason,</HI> (for she intertained him into her house at the ile <HI>Lemnos</HI> (now it is named <HI>Stalamine.) Tertia messis erat, cùm tu dare vela coactus, Implesti lachrymis talia verba meis: Abstrahor Hypsipule: si dent modò fata recursum: Vir tuus hinc abeo, vir tibi semper ero. Quod tamen è nobis grauida celatur in aluo, Viuat, &amp; eiusdem simus vterquè parens.</HI> Thus in English by M. <HI>George Tuberuile:</HI> When third Autumne came on that thou of force wert faine, To hoise thy sailes, these words thou spakest with gushing teares amaine; Mine owne, I must depart: if fortune say Amen, From hence I passe thy spouse and will thy spouse repasse againe. The imp within thy wombe God grant that it may liue; And we his parents both y feare a decent name may giue. They which desire a larger description of this nauigation, (which <HI>Philostephanus</HI> saith was made in one <HI>long shippe;</HI> or with a nauy or saile of diuers shippes, as <HI>Pharax</HI> reporteth) let him repaire to those three forenamed au∣thours often cited by vs. To these he may adioine <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in his fourth booke: <HI>Ouids</HI> seuenth booke of his <HI>Metamor∣phosis: Hyginus</HI> fables: <HI>Pindarus</HI> and <HI>Callimachus:</HI> and if he please, the history of <HI>Dares</HI> the Phrygian. <HI>Appian</HI> in his <HI>Mithri∣datica</HI> writeth, That <HI>Cneius Pompeius</HI> after that he had pursued <HI>Mithridates,</HI> euen as farre as <HI>Colchis,</HI> that he went aland heere,

<HEAD>TEMPE THESSALICA, OR The PARADISE of THESSALY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Eing admonished in my sleepe by the Goddesse <HI>Fessonia,</HI> (which they were wont to adore and pray vnto, that by reason of any great labour or farre trauell were faint and weary <HI>(fessi)</HI> that after this long and tedious peregrination ouer the whole world, I should bethinke my selfe of some place of rest, where the painfull students, faint and wearied in this long and wearisome iourney, might recreate themselues; I presently, as soone as I awaked, went about it: and while I surueigh all the quarters of the huge globe of the Earth, behold the noble TEMPE, famous for their sacred groues, by the leading of <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> that renowmed Geographer, do offer themselues to my view and consideration: those therefore shaddowed out in their true and liuely colours with the best art of painters pencill: and rudely described by our more vnskilfull penne we haue annexed to the end of these our labours. They are si∣tuate in AEMMONIA, as <HI>Ouid</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> do testifie: or THESSALIA, which is all one in the iudgement of <HI>Solinus</HI> and <HI>Liuy.</HI> But in regard that the riuer <HI>Peneus (Pezin,</HI> or <HI>Salampria)</HI> doth part <HI>Thessaly</HI> from <HI>Macedony,</HI> they seeme ra∣ther to be situate in the confines of both these countries, than to be conteined wholly within the bound of one. <HI>Strabo Pliny, Herodotus, Liuy</HI> and <HI>Theon,</HI> the petifogger, by the iudgement of <HI>Theopompus,</HI> do place these <HI>Tempe,</HI> or this large and pleasant plaine (through the middest of which the goodly cleare riuer <HI>Peneus</HI> doth runne) between the two stately mountaines <HI>Ossa, (Olira,</HI> or <HI>Cossouo)</HI> and <HI>Olympus,</HI> now called <HI>Lacha. Solinus</HI> also is of the same opinion, as appeareth by these his wordes: <HI>Peneus</HI> the riuer, which running between the mountaines <HI>Ossa</HI> and <HI>Olympus,</HI> with the goodly hils rising and falling gently by degrees, and woody vales, doth make the pleasant <HI>Tempe</HI> in <HI>Thessalia; Tempe, quae syluae cin∣gunt super impendentes,</HI> The <HI>Tempe</HI> which the ouer-hanging groues do round inclose, as <HI>Catullus</HI> the poet in his <HI>Argo∣nautickes,</HI> hath left recorded. It is, as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith, about three lands breadths ouer, <HI>(sesqui iugerum, AElianus</HI> calleth it <HI>Plethrum.)</HI> The length (which they do define to be from the mouth of the riuer <HI>Gannum,</HI> euen vnto the bay, now vul∣garly called <HI>Golfo di Salonichi,</HI> then <HI>Sinus Thermaeus</HI>) is as <HI>Liuy</HI> testifieth fiue miles, or as <HI>AElianus</HI> saith, which is all one, forty furlongs. These mountaines, <HI>Liuy</HI> writeth are so high, steepe, and craggy on all sides, that a man may scarce looke downe from off the toppe of them, without a dazling of the eies, and giddinesse of the braine. The noise also and depth of the riuer <HI>Peneus,</HI> which runneth through the middest of the valley, is very terrible. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith that the stately toppes of these mountaines, on euery side do rise by little and little vp higher into the aire, than a man may well discern. Within these hils the goodly riuer <HI>Peneus</HI> doth runne; which for his crystall waters, rowling ouer the smooth pebbles; the goodly meddowes and grasse alwaies fresh and green vpon the bankes: the ouerhanging groues and trees continu∣ally resounding with the melodious harmony of sweet singing birds, is so pleasant and delightsome as any in the world beside. But because all these authours haue spoken of it, as it were by the way, and not of set purpose: I thinke it not a∣misse to set downe in this place, the description of it, done by <HI>AElianus</HI> as you may read in the first chapter of his third booke <HI>De varia historia,</HI> where it is most curiously and absolutely set out in his true and liuelie colours. These therefore are his wordes.</P>
<P>There is a place between <HI>Olympus</HI> and <HI>Ossa,</HI> the two loftiest mountaines of all <HI>Thessaly,</HI> disioined one from another, by the diuine prouidence of eternall God, by a faire plaine or leuell running between them: the length of this plaine or valley is fortie furlongs: It is from one side to the other in some places, two or three lands breadths ouer, in some places it is somewhat broader. Through the middest of this valley runneth the riuer <HI>Peneus:</HI> into which also other riuers fal∣ling and mingling their waters with his, do much encrease the streame of <HI>Peneus.</HI> This place is most pleasant and de∣lightsome, by reason of his great varietie of all sorts of alluring and inticeing pleasures, neuer made by any art or industry of man, but by nature it selfe, shewing all her skill in the beautifying of this valleie, at such time as it was first made. There is in this place great store of iuie alwaie green and flourishing, alwaie budding and putting forth his pleasant slowres, euer clinging and winding in maner like the goodlie vine, about the tallest trees, and clambring vp by little and little vn∣till it come euen to the verie toppe. In the same places grow the aie-green yeugh-tree, which lifting vp it selfe aloft vpon the rockes, shaddoweth the caues, holes and cliffes, which beneath lie lurking in the vale. All other things whatsoeuer do flourish, blossome, and beare flowers are there to be seene: this is a most gallant and glorious shew for the eies to be∣hold. In the plaine, when the sunne is at his height in summer, you shall haue manie goodlie shaddowie groues and di∣uers places of shelter, into which trauellers, desirous for to refresh their wearied limmes from the violence of the heat and their noisome sweat, do betake themselues, as into the most pleasant and delightsomest innes and harboroughs that are in the world. Moreouer of ouerflowing wels and pleasant springs of most coole and fresh waters running heere and there in sundrie places of this valleie, there are verie manie and diuers: which if we shall beleeue the report of our fathers, haue been verie wholesome and soueraigne to sundrie sorts of diseased persons that haue washed themselues in the same. Againe, diuers birds heere and there dispersed in these groues and woods, do make the guests great mirth at their ban∣quets, with their sweet singing and pleasant tunes: especially those which haue the lowdest and sweetest voices, do so please and hold the eares of the heares, that those which passe by this waie are so rauished and delighted with this their musicke, that they instantly forget all their trauels and businesse. On ech banke of the riuer such are the delights, plea∣sures and recreations for the wearied trauellers, as before we haue mentioned. Yet the riuer <HI>Peneus,</HI> going on leasurely, and smoothly like an oile, runneth quietly through the middest of the <HI>Tempe.</HI> About this riuer, by reason of the trees which grow vpon the bankes, and their farre-spreading boughs, is a most goodly shade: so that such as row in boates, vp and downe vpon this streame, for almost a whole day together, may saile in the pleasant shade free from the violence and schorching heat of the sunne. The people which dwell vpon this riuer, do oft times meet in companies, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another. Hauing done diuine seruice and ceremonies in due forme and maner, they ban∣quet and make merrie. Therefore those which do these seruices and performe these ceremonies being very many, it is no maruell though such as come hither to walke for recreation, those which trauell by this way or saile vp or downe this riuer vpon what occasion soeuer, do continually smell a most sweet and fragrant sauour. In this maner this place was consecrated with great honour &amp; religious seruices. These things and many other hath <HI>Aelianus</HI> written of these <HI>Tempe.</HI></P>

<P>Of these also <HI>Procopius</HI> (although he nameth them not by name) hath written in his fourth booke <HI>De Aedif. Iustiniani Imperatoris.</HI> There is a braue description of these places in <HI>Catullus</HI> his Argonauticks. But I thinke it good here to set downe out of diuers writers certaine seuerall things of these <HI>Tempe,</HI> as they are here and there dispersed in their works. <HI>Maximus Tyrius,</HI> in his xxxix. oration, hath left recorded, that diuine honour in olde time was done to the riuer <HI>Pe∣neus,</HI> for his maruellous goodly beautie and farre-surpassing cleere waters. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, that this riuer doeth admit into his channell the streame of the brooke <HI>Eurotas,</HI> but so as it swimmeth aloft like oile; and hauing caried it so for a certaine space, casteth it off againe, as refusing to quaint and intermeddle his siluer streame with his filthy stincking troubled waters. The same authour sayth, that here groweth great plentie of Laurell, Polypody, Dolichus (a kinde of beane) Wilde-time, and Water-lilly: but this hath a blacke flower, if we may beleeue <HI>Apuleius. Pausanias</HI> in his <HI>Pho∣cica,</HI> writeth that the temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> at <HI>Delphos</HI> was built of Laurell boughes which grew in this place. <HI>Mela</HI> and the Poets do speake of <HI>Ossa,</HI> the mountaine memorable for the fabulous storie of the Giants: who also doe report, that the <HI>Lapithae</HI> a people of <HI>Thessaly,</HI> did sometime dwell here. In the same mountaine I reade in <HI>Polyaenus</HI> his fourth booke, that <HI>Alexander</HI> King of <HI>Indica,</HI> (for so I do rather yeeld to haue it read, than <HI>India,</HI> as hitherto the interpretours haue set foorth, seeing that <HI>Indica</HI> is a countrey hard by <HI>Pontus,</HI> as <HI>Stephanus</HI> directly auerreth) by hewing downe the craggie cliffes of this mountaine, did make certaine small staires, which sequent ages called <HI>Alexanders ladder.</HI> Nere these <HI>Tem∣pe</HI> there is a water described by <HI>Seneca</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> which is so ilfauoured and filthy, that it will make any man affrayd to looke into it; and which, they say, will eat and consume both brasse and yron. <HI>Vitruuius</HI> also in the third chapter of his eighth booke saith, That in <HI>Tessaly</HI> there is a well or spring of running water, whereof no cattell will drinke, nor any ma∣ner of beast will once come neere; hard by this fountain is a tree which beareth a purple flower. Thus far <HI>Vitruuius.</HI> Of the mount <HI>Olympus</HI> (which <HI>Homer,</HI> in the second booke of his <HI>Odysses,</HI> calleth <HI>The seat of the Gods) Solinus</HI> out of the sixt booke of <HI>Varro, De lingua Latina,</HI> citeth, That it riseth vp so exceeding high into the aire, that the people neere adioyn∣ing do call his lofty top, <HI>Heauen. Lucane</HI> saith that <HI>it is higher than the clouds.</HI> For <HI>it is tenne furlongs high,</HI> as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Aemilius,</HI> by the authority of <HI>Xenagoras,</HI> who measured it, hath left recorded. <HI>No bird nor fowle doth flie higher than the toppe of this hill,</HI> as <HI>Apuleius</HI> in his booke intituled <HI>De Deo Socratis,</HI> doth affirme. In the very toppe of it there is an <HI>Altar built and consecrated to Iupiter,</HI> where if any of the entrals of beasts sacrificed be left, they are neither blowen a∣bout by the blustring blasts of the roughest windes, nor dissolued by the dampish aire or washing stormie raines: but the next yeere after, that time twelue-moneth, looke how they were left, so they shall finde them: and at all times and seasons of the yeere, whatsoeuer is there once consecrated and offered to that God, is preserued from all putrefaction and corruption of the aire: Letters also written and drawen in the ashes doe so remaine vntill the next solemnity of the like rites and ceremonies the yeere following. Thus farre <HI>Solinus Polyhistor. Et nubibus intactum Macedo miratur O∣lympum:</HI> The Macedonian braue admir'th <HI>Olympus</HI> top to see So high and stately, far aboue the highest clouds to be: as <HI>Claudian</HI> the poet hath spoken of it in his poeme of the warres of the Goths. Of this mountaine, <HI>Varro,</HI> in his sixth booke <HI>De lingua Latina,</HI> noteth that the Muses were named <HI>Olympiades.</HI> And thus far generally of these <HI>Tempe,</HI> which from the beginning had not this forme and goodly countenance as all ancient writers doe constantly with one consent affirme: but the riuer <HI>Peneus,</HI> being inclosed with mountaines, and entertaining many riuers into it, did all ouerflow the valley, making it to stand full of water like a fenne or pond: and afterward when the mountaines <HI>Olympus</HI> and <HI>Ossa,</HI> which sometime did touch one another, were disioyned and rent asunder (which happened by reason of an earthquake, as <HI>Strabo, Seneca,</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> haue written: others, as <HI>Herodotus, Claudian,</HI> and <HI>Philostratus,</HI> do ascribe it to <HI>Neptune:</HI> others, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> and <HI>Lucane,</HI> to <HI>Hercules</HI>) and so by that meanes <HI>Peneus</HI> found an issue and way to vnload it selfe into the maine ocean; whereby it came to passe that the valley was emptied and cleane dried vp. By <HI>Stephanus</HI> in his booke of Cities, I finde that this tract and plot of ground was first called LYTAE, before it was disburdened of those waters. <HI>Eurypides</HI> in his tragedy intituled <HI>Troades,</HI> calleth it <HI>Semnan choran,</HI> the sacred and honourable countrey. Amongst the poets there is euery where much speech of this most goodly coast: to wit, in <HI>Virgill, Ouid, Horace, Catullus, Clau∣dian, Statius, Lucan, Flaccus</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> where you may obserue these epithites attributed and spoken of it; some cal∣ling it <HI>Tempe Thessala, Peneia, Heliconia, Phthiotica;</HI> others, <HI>Tempe Frigida, Tenebrosa, Nemorosa, Opaca, Gratissima, Lucentia, Oloria,</HI> and <HI>Teumessia.</HI> The paradise of <HI>Thessaly, Peneus, Helicon, Phthiotis:</HI> the colde, shadowy, woody, coole, kinde, swanny and Teumessiam paradise; although this latter, with the singular learned man <HI>Hermolaus Barba∣rus,</HI> I doe thinke not to belong properly to this place, but rather vnto another most delightfull place in <HI>Boeotia,</HI> where we learne out of <HI>Pausanias, Strabo, Stephanus</HI> and <HI>Hesychius,</HI> that the mountaine <HI>Teumessus</HI> is seated. For <HI>Lutatius</HI> the Grammarian I hold to be deceiued, who calleth the place The city <HI>Trumessia.</HI> Neither is this altogether an vnaccusto∣med thing or vnusuall amongst writers, especially poets, to vse this word <HI>Tempe,</HI> and to speake it figuratiuely of other places, famous for their many delightfull pleasures; as you may see by <HI>Heloria Tempe,</HI> a place in <HI>Sicilia;</HI> and another in <HI>Tiburtina villa Latij,</HI> a place in <HI>Villa Hadriani;</HI> if you will giue credit to <HI>Spartianus</HI> in the life of the Emperour <HI>Hadrian:</HI> againe there was a College in <HI>Athens</HI> knowen by this name. So <HI>Dionysius</HI> and <HI>Priscianus</HI> do name <HI>Daphne,</HI> the suburbs of <HI>Antioch, Tempe. Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Flaminius</HI> describeth a place neere the riuer <HI>Apsus (Spirnasse</HI> or <HI>Vreo</HI> in <HI>Macedonia)</HI> for pleasantnesse much resembling the <HI>Tempe.</HI> Of these and such like places I cannot but I must needs adde these words of the Emperour <HI>Iulian</HI> vnto <HI>Libanius</HI> the sophister, and so to end my speech of this most goodly valley: Then, saith he, <HI>Batnae,</HI> a city of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> did entertaine me: a place such, as, only <HI>Daphne,</HI> the suburbs of <HI>Antioch</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> excep∣ted, in all my life I neuer saw the like: <HI>Daphne</HI> which now is compared to <HI>Batnae,</HI> when as before excepting the temple and image, I would not doubt not only to compare it, but also farre to preferre it, before <HI>Ossa, Pelion, Olympus,</HI> and the Thessalian vallies &amp;c. (he meaneth <HI>Tempe</HI>). These <HI>Batnae</HI> are situate (if any man be desirous to know) in <HI>Osroëna,</HI> a pro∣uince of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> as <HI>Zozimus</HI> and <HI>Stephanus</HI> doe thinke; or in <HI>Anthemusia,</HI> as <HI>Ammianus</HI> affirmeth; in the way betweene <HI>Antioch</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> and <HI>Carrae.</HI> Thus farre of these <HI>Tempe.</HI> But because I see that <HI>Daphne,</HI> the suburbs of <HI>An∣tioch</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> is of some writers conteined vnder this name, and that it is as pleasant a place as the <HI>Tempe,</HI> I will addresse my selfe to describe and tricke this out also; but in the next page following, not in this.</P>

<HEAD>DAPHNE, OR The pleasant Suburbs of <HI>Antiochia</HI> in <HI>Syria.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>APHNE of <HI>Antiochia</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> vpon the riuer <HI>Oronies,</HI> that famous and pleasant Suburbs, which <HI>Ammianus</HI> calleth, <HI>Amoenum &amp; ambitiosum,</HI> A delectable and gorgeous place, is distant from the citie about fortie furlongs. It is in compasse foure-score furlongs (or, which is all one, tenne miles) as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth; who moreouer saith, that it is a pretty village, within a huge darke groue, watered with diuers goodly brookes and running waters. But take this larger description of it, out of <HI>Sozomen:</HI> It is a place, sayth he, round beset and shadowed with many Cypresse trees, [and those of infinite height, as <HI>Philostratus</HI> reporteth] yet here and there it is bedecked with sundry o∣ther sorts of goodly trees: by reason of the thicknesse of whose boughs and leaues, which by no meanes suffereth the Sunne-beames to come vnto the ground, it is all close couered ouer with a shadow as it were with a roofe. Vnder the trees, the earth, according to the seasons of the yeere, bringeth forth of all sorts, most pleasant and sweet-smelling flowers, one after another. Item, it is a place, both for the great plenty and pleasantnesse of the waters [<HI>Strabo</HI> calleth them, Running waters; <HI>Philostratus,</HI> Still or standing waters:] as also in respect of the temperature of the aire and kinde seasons of the yeere; lastly, in regard of the coole blastes and gales of windes which here doe ordinarily blowe, (yeelding also, as <HI>Calistus</HI> addeth, a sweet and pleasant whistling noise) most dele∣ctable, and for all maner of pleasure and recreation, passing fit and commodious. Here is also a spring, which is supposed to fetch his waters from <HI>Castalius,</HI> a spring by <HI>Parnassus</HI> in <HI>Greece:</HI> wherefore some men haue attributed to it the vertue and power of diuination, and doe verily perswade themselues, that it was of equall force and nature with that at <HI>Delphos.</HI> The vulgar sort and common people to these do adde this fable; namely, That the daughter of <HI>Ladon (Ouid</HI> hath <HI>Peneus)</HI> a riuer in <HI>Arcadia,</HI> did flie hither from her louer, and here was transformed into a tree. Yet <HI>Apollo</HI> not thus quieted in minde, but crowning himselfe with the boughes of that tree which he especially delighted in, and embracing the tree, and the place where it stood, beloued of him aboue all places in the world beside, did honour and grace it more than euer any other what∣soeuer. <HI>Gulielmus Tyrius,</HI> in the tenth chapter of his fourth booke, doth make mention of a fountaine or spring called <HI>Daph∣nis;</HI> which, he sayth, by deuices and pipes into diuers places is so cunningly conueyed, that it affoordeth, at certeine set times, great plenty of water. The situation therefore and nature of the place, the argument and matter of the fabulous story, which was altogether of loue, and applied vnto wantonnesse, oft times did imprint in the mindes of corrupt and ill disposed yoong men (taking this slight occasion) twise so great a desire of this wanton life as by nature they had before. For they, repeating those matters, spoke of in those fables, as it were in defence and excuse of their follies, were the more inflamed and pricked forward to the same: so that, casting off all shame and honesty, they are in these their lasciuious acts caried with such heat and violence, that by no meanes they are able to temper themselues, nor abide to see here any modest man in company with them. The nature therefore of this place being thus, it was held for a vile thing and great disgrace, for any honest and ciuill man to be seene in it. For if any men, of those places neere adioyning, were by chance seene heere without his wench, he was counted for a very clowne or sot, a man of no bringing vp, or good maners, nor fit for any gentle-mans company. Thus farre <HI>Sozomen.</HI> It was a defencible place, enclosed with a strong wall or rampart, as appeareth out of the seuen and twen∣tieth booke of <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> who writeth that <HI>Beronice</HI> betaking her selfe to this place for a refuge, was besieged by <HI>Se∣leucus,</HI> but might by no meanes be taken. Item, he maketh mention of the Enginers of <HI>Daphne, (Ballistarij Daphnenses.)</HI> Moreouer, it was also, as <HI>Metaphrastes</HI> writeth in the life of <HI>Artemius,</HI> graced with many <HI>goodly buildings, houses</HI> and <HI>bathes.</HI> In it was a <HI>chapell</HI> of very gorgeous and costly workemanship, wherein stood the braue statue or image of <HI>Apollo Daphneus,</HI> or, of the Daphneian god, as <HI>Iulian</HI> the Emperour termeth it; equalling, as <HI>Ammianus</HI> sayth, the greatnesse of the counter∣fet of <HI>Iupiter Olympius.</HI> Heere also was <HI>a temple and sanctuarie of Diana,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> testifieth. Item, heere <HI>Germanicus Caesar</HI> kept his Courts, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> hath recorded: and here afterward, saith <HI>Suidas, Constantine</HI> the Great built a palace, where he set vp the statue of <HI>Helena</HI> his mother: (<HI>Augustale,</HI> he calleth it; which is, that I may note this by the way, as <HI>Quintilian,</HI> in the second chapter of his eighth booke of his Institutions, doth interpret it, <HI>Tabernaculum Ducis,</HI> The pauilion of the generall.) The same <HI>Constantine</HI> caused this place to be named after his name, CONSTANTINIANA DAPHNE. <HI>Callistus</HI> and <HI>Grego∣ras</HI> do report, that one <HI>Mamianus,</HI> in the time of <HI>Zeno</HI> the Emperour, did build that place which was called ANTIFORVM. Here also was the church of <HI>Saint Euphemia,</HI> where <HI>S. Thomas</HI> the Abbat was buried. Item, the church of <HI>S. Michael,</HI> which, as <HI>Procopius</HI> in his second booke of the Persian history writeth, was burnt by <HI>Cosroes.</HI> That this was a most pleasant place, beside those things heere alledged, other histories also doe plainly shew: for <HI>Eutropius</HI> hath left recorded, That <HI>Cneus Pom∣peius</HI> being delighted with the pleasantnesse of the place, and great plenty of water, gaue vnto the Daphnenses a certeine plot of ground, that they might there farther enlarge the same. <HI>Iulius Capitolinus</HI> writeth, That <HI>Verus,</HI> that voluptuous Empe∣rour, did vsually spend the Summer in <HI>Daphne,</HI> the rest of the yeere at <HI>Antiochia. Lampridius</HI> sayth, That <HI>Alexander Seue∣rus</HI> executed some of the Tribunes of his legions or companies, for that by their negligence they had suffered diuers souldi∣ours to keepe riot and take their pleasure too much in <HI>Daphne.</HI> In <HI>Volcatius</HI> I reade of <HI>Auidius Cassius,</HI> That he caused procla∣mation to be made, that euery man should repaire to his Ancient, and to haue caused billes to be set vpon euery wall, That if any man were found in <HI>Daphne</HI> armed, <HI>(cinctus)</HI> he should returne from thence disarmed <HI>(discinctus.)</HI> (For <HI>Seruius</HI> at that place of <HI>Virgill, Discinctus Mulciber Afros,</HI> doth interpet the word, <HI>Discinctus, id est, militiae inhabilis.</HI>) Notwithstanding, it was of the Gentiles had in no lesse reuerence and estimation for the certeinty of those Oracles, which, as <HI>Suidas</HI> reporteth, were vttered and giuen forth in a coole and soft blast, breathed forth of the waters there. For they say that <HI>Hadrian</HI> who af∣terward was Emperour, before such timeas he was called to any publike office, hauing in a fountaine here dipped a Cypresse leafe, did together with the water sucke in a certeine faculty of diuining things to come. <HI>Iulianus</HI> in his <HI>Misopogonos</HI> writeth, That he had so many times and oft gone vnto this Oracle, that he could not possibly call to mir de how oft. In his time also, <HI>Sozomen, Theodoret,</HI> and <HI>Saint Chrysostome</HI> do write, that this Oracle ceased to giue any answer at all. For <HI>Gallus</HI> the brother of this <HI>Iulian,</HI> being elected <HI>Caesar</HI> by his father <HI>Constantius,</HI> because he was by profession a Christian, determined to cleanse and purge this place of that heathenish superstition, and that by this meanes: He commanded the coffin of <HI>Saint Babyla,</HI> that constant Martyr, and of others, which in the persecution of <HI>Numerianus</HI> suffered martyrdome with him, to be brought from <HI>Antiochia</HI> thither: by whose presence onely, which <HI>Gallus</HI> before had truely deemed, that diuell at an istant became wholly dumbe. But the foresayd <HI>Iulianus</HI> purposing to make warre vpon the Persians, and according as his maner was, comming with great deuotion to this his <HI>Daphne,</HI> and killing many oxen and other cattell for sacrifices, demanded of the Oracle what the euent of this his warre would be; answer was made him, by the idoll, that by reason of the neerenesse of the dead bodies

<PB REF="322"/> (meaning <HI>Babyla</HI> with the rest, although he named them not) he was neuer able any more hereafter to answer ought of things to come. <HI>Iulianus</HI> taking this hardly, commanded the Christians to cary away the coffin of <HI>Babyla</HI> from thence into another place: which was straightway accordingly performed. Not long after (the very next night, as one authour affirmeth) by chance the chapell was set on fire, which consumed the roofe of the same, and burnt the image to ashes. This was the end of this <HI>Apollo</HI> of <HI>Daphne,</HI> as also of his temple. <HI>Saint Chrysostome</HI> writeth, that in his time there stood one columne or pillar of it firme and sound, which neither any violent tempest of winde and weather, or trembling earth-quake had shaken or ouer∣throwen; so that he supposed that it expected and looked to be amended and repaired againe by some succedent Emperours or others: And although <HI>Procopius</HI> affirmeth that this temple was reedified by <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperour, yet <HI>Cedrenus</HI> (who li∣ued long since <HI>Saint Chrysostome</HI>) sayth, that in his time there remained neither sticke nor stone of it. Which also my good friend <HI>M. Ioachimus Axonius Grauianus,</HI> a man for diuers and sundry farre trauels vndertaken and performed by him, and e∣specially for his skill in diuers strange languages very famous and honourable, an eye-witnesse of this same place, doth iustifie to be true: for he being by my selfe demanded of the moderne estate of this place, plainly answered, that beside certaine trees, there is not any thing of it at all to be seene. But of the firing and burning downe of this temple, the report of diuers writers is diuers. <HI>Saint Chrysostome</HI> sayth that it was done by the diuell. Many affirme it to haue beene kindled by thunder and lightning from heauen. The infidels commonly did father this act vpon the Christians. <HI>Iulianus</HI> the Emperour in his <HI>Misopogonos</HI> writeth, that it was defaced by the negligence of the warders or watchmen, and the desperate rashnesse of some wicked and base fellowes. But the Sextens, Church-keepers, and Priests, as <HI>Theodoret</HI> testifieth, when they were whipped for their negligence, sayd plainly, that the fire began not at the ground or bottome, but at the top, and so consequently by all likelihood did fall from heauen. And the clownes and countrey-people which dwelt not farre off, affirmed that they saw lightning fall from heauen vpon that place. But of this let vs heare <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> who in his two and twentieth booke hath these words of it: <HI>Iulianus</HI> had the Christians in a iealousie for the fact, moued thereunto, as he thought, by enuy and malice. But the same was, although but lightly reported and of small credit, that this chapell was fired vpon this occa∣sion: <HI>Asclepiades</HI> the Philosopher comming to see <HI>Iulianus</HI> the Emperour, staying in these suburbs, was woont whithersoe∣uer he went to cary about him a little siluer image of the heauenly goddesse <HI>(Dea coelestis)</HI> which he set below vnderneath the feet of this idoll; and lighting torches and waxe candles, as the maner was, went his way: whereupon about mid-night, when no man could be there nor at hand to helpe, the sparkles flying vp gat hold vpon the old rotten timber, and the fire be∣ing kindled and increasing greatly by reason of the drinesse of the fewell, streamed vpward and caught hold vpon whatsoeuer it might reach, yea indeed were it neuer so high, and burnt it cleane downe to the ground. Notwithstanding, we learne out of <HI>Nicephorus Callistus,</HI> That this same place from that time was not altogether forsaken and contemned, but was woont of a long time after to be frequented, and that games, playes and shewes were vsually held and kept there.</P>
<P><HI>Aethicus</HI> (or, more truly, <HI>Iulius Orator</HI>) accounteth this <HI>Daphne</HI> (yet falsly and vntruely he calleth it <HI>Daphe,</HI> not <HI>Daphne</HI>) amongst the most goodly and famous townes of the East sea. <HI>Metaphrastes</HI> also, in the life of <HI>S. Artemius,</HI> maketh it a citie: <HI>Claudian,</HI> the Christian Poet, calleth it <HI>Apollineum nemus, Apollo's</HI> groue: <HI>Dionysius, Sacra Tempe,</HI> The holy Tempe: and his old interpreter, <HI>Optima Tempe,</HI> The goodly Tempe: in ancient coines, we sayd before, they were called <HI>Constantiniana Tempe, Constantines</HI> Tempe: in the iournall set forth by <HI>Peter Pithoeus, Palatium Daphne,</HI> The Palace of <HI>Daphne.</HI> But why should I not here insert these verses of <HI>Petronius Arbiter</HI> written of it? <HI>Nobilis aestiuas platanus diffuderat vmbras, Et baccis redimita</HI> Daphne, <HI>tremulaequè Cupressus, Et circumtonsae trepidanti vertice pinus. Has inter ludebat aquis errantibus amnis Spumeus, &amp; querulo vexabat rore capillos. Dignus amore locus. In summer time the broad-leafd plane had cast his shade about, Braue</HI> Daphne <HI>crowned was with bayes, sweet Cypresse proud and stout, And here and there the taller pines with rounded toppes look'd out: Amid these ran a foaming brooke, with wandring streame so fast, That all their lower boughs beneath with water were bedasht. This pleasant place who can but loue?</HI></P>
<P>And thus much of the name, situation, &amp; nature of this place: now there do yet remaine some things somewhat pertinent to this matter, which I thought good to adioyne to those former. <HI>Saint Hierome, Eusebius</HI> in his Chronicle, and <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> do write, that <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great, returning from <HI>Persia,</HI> consecrated this groue, and thereto adioyned a goodly large forrest. <HI>Ammianus</HI> attributeth the building of the temple to <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes: Sozomen,</HI> and <HI>Callistus,</HI> to <HI>Seleucus: Theodoret</HI> saith, that the image or statue, within was of wood, but on the outside gilt all ouer: this also <HI>Simon Metaphrastes,</HI> in the place before cited, doth iustifie to be true: where he maketh a large description of the same: <HI>Cedrenus</HI> affirmeth, that this image was the workmanship of <HI>Bryxides,</HI> or, <HI>Bryaxides,</HI> as I had rather reade with <HI>Vitruuius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Columella;</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> who writeth that he was one of the foure that carued the <HI>Mausoleum,</HI> that is, the tombe of <HI>Mausolus</HI> king of <HI>Caria,</HI> made by his wife <HI>Artemisia.</HI> It was inhibited by proclamation, That no Cypresse tree should be taken from hence, or cut downe, and that whosoeuer should fell any of them, was to be grieuously punished by an act made by <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Emperour. These Cypresse trees were preserued here, as <HI>Philostratus</HI> writeth, in memory of <HI>Cyparissus,</HI> a yong man of <HI>Assyria,</HI> turned in∣to this tree. <HI>Suidas</HI> recordeth, that this place was the natiue soile of <HI>Theon</HI> the Philosopher and Stoicke, who wrote a defence of <HI>Socrates.</HI> I doe also remember, that I haue read in some good authour, whose name I haue forgotten, that there was one of the <HI>Sibylla's</HI> borne here. <HI>Ammianus</HI> telleth of a monster borne here, as he himselfe both saw with his eies, and heard with his eares from the relation of others: namely, of a childe hauing two mouthes, two teeth, a beard, foure eies, and two very short or little eares. In <HI>Strabo</HI> I finde recorded from the relation of <HI>Nicolaus Damascenus,</HI> that from <HI>Porus,</HI> a King of <HI>India,</HI> certaine Ambassadours came hither to <HI>Augustus Caesar. Procopius</HI> in the second booke of his Persian stories writeth, that <HI>Cosroes</HI> the king of <HI>Persia</HI> did here sacrifice to the Nymphes. With what pompe and traine <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes</HI> did once come to this place, what shewes and bankets he made here, as also one <HI>Grypus</HI> at another time, if any man be desirous to see, let him reade <HI>Athenaeus</HI> his fifth and tenth books, and I doubt but he will greatly woonder. Of this <HI>Daphne,</HI> I would to God that worke of <HI>Protagorides,</HI> which he wrote of the Daphnensian Playes, Feasts, and Assemblies, whereof <HI>Athenaeus</HI> maketh mention in his fourth booke; together with that oration written by <HI>Libanius</HI> the Sophister, which <HI>Iulian</HI> in his epistles spea∣keth of, and so highly commendeth, were extant. <HI>Agathias</HI> in the prooeme to his historie affirmeth that he wrote the histo∣ries of this <HI>Daphne</HI> in Hexameter verse. I sayd before out of <HI>Tacitus</HI> that <HI>Germanicus Caesar</HI> kept his Court in this forrest, in whom, at this day in the 11 booke of his Annals, we reade these words: His tombe was at <HI>Antioch,</HI> where his corps was burnt: his court he held at <HI>Epidaphne,</HI> in which place he ended his dayes. Here for <HI>Epidaphne</HI> I reade <HI>Daphne,</HI> or, at <HI>Daphne:</HI> For of <HI>Epidaphne,</HI> for the name of a place, I finde no mention in any history, beside in <HI>Pliny,</HI> in his one and twentieth chapter of his fifth booke, where thou hast these words: <HI>Antiochia libera, Epidaphnes cognominata:</HI> as if this were a synonyme or equi∣ualent to <HI>Antiochia;</HI> yet being indeed as corrupt and falsly written as that other, and ought to be thus amended, <HI>Antiochia libera apud Daphnen, Antioch</HI> by <HI>Daphne</HI> is free. That this is true, <HI>Strabo, Plutarch, Ammian,</HI> and others do sufficiently testi∣fie, as we haue shewed more at large in the second edition of our Geographicall treasurie, in the word ANTIOCHIA.</P>

<HEAD>Of the first FOVNDATION and ORDER of the GERMANE EMPIRE in the West. THE FIRST TABLE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER that IVLIVS CAESAR had by continuall warres appeased almost all those broiles and seditious quarels which for certaine yeeares passed had much troubled the Romane state, and had sent Pompey and those other vnfortunate enuiers of his valour and prosperous successe in martiall affaires, either dead vnto the Diuell, or aliue by banishment had remooued them farre off into forren countries, as a valiant Conquerour of all entereth triumphantly into ROME: where challenging and assuming vnto himselfe a soueraigne authority and honour aboue all (himselfe indeed as a Monarch at his pleasure commanding all) was the first that began the FOVRTH MONARCHY, which of the place where it first seated it selfe, was sirnamed, <HI>The Romane Monarchy.</HI> In this dignity, which was the greatest that could be giuen to any mortall man, carrying himselfe most tyrannously and proudly (for he commanded that his statue or image should be set vp amongst the odious and wicked kings, and that his chaire of Estate shoud be made of beaten gold, and withall requested the Citizens to giue vnto him diuine honour; and to worship him as a god) certaine Al∣dermen or Senators, loathing that his lordly gouernment in the Senat house wounded him in three &amp; twenty seuerall places, whereof he died, in the yeare 709. after the building of the city of Rome. Notwithstanding he being thus made away, the chiefe authority and Empire ceassed not to reside amongst the Romanes, for AVGVSTVS, the sole adopted heire of Caesar, presently steppeth into the Imperiall seat, and by force of armes layeth hold vpon the soueraigne dignity and whatsoeuer else his predecessour had by hooke or crooke possessed and en∣ioyed. Vnder his gouernment all things being still and hushed, there being now not so much as the least noice of tumultuous warres stirring in the world, all men generally admiring this blessed and happy peace, do withall in like maner of all policies, highly extoll the monarchy, as authour and preseruer of the same. Vnder the name of this title, the Romanes alone for many ages together most honourable and fearefull to others, were victours and conquerours wheresoeuer they became; vntill at length certaine idle and cruell minded men being promoted vnto that dignity, did choose rather tyrannouslie to shew their force and power at home against their kinsfolke, friends, subiects, and best men of all sorts, then abroad a∣gainst the publicke enemy and disturber of the state. These men by all maner of vnlawfull meanes succeeding one another, at last the Empire and managing of the common-wealth was onely in the hands of Tyrants and Vsurpers: neither was there any man now that euer would once trouble himselfe to defend the same from the furious assault of the raging enemy: and no maruell. For euen the Empire it selfe, and whatsoeuer did of right belong vnto the same, was by the souldiers bought and sold for money, or giuen for fauour and affection. While all things stood thus in the Roman Empire, ODOACER, king of the <HI>Hunnes,</HI> with a mighty army inuadeth the same, and in all places wheresoeuer he became, ouerthroweth and beateth downe the Romane forces and garrisons: for at this time in the idle and dissolute souldiers there remained neither strength nor true fortitude. AVGVSTVLVS the Emperour, hearing of these newes, being smitten into a great feare, flieth, and that he might the better escape vn∣knowen, in the flight throweth off his imperiall robes and ornaments. In the meane time Odoacer speedeth himselfe toward Rome, besiegeth it, taketh it, and within a few daies after he was wholly and quietly possessed of it, changeth the name of it, and after his owne name caused it by pro∣clamation to be called ODOACRIA: but together with the ancient name this city leaueth the former beauty and lusture, there is nothing now heere to be seene but miserable destruction and ruine. This prosperous successe and easie inuasion of the city of Rome by Odoacer, within foure∣teen yeares after, giueth occasion to THEODORICVS, king of the <HI>Gothes,</HI> who was then in Thrace, to attempt the same. Therefore mustering his men, with many thousands of Goths, he entreth Italy, driueth Odoacer out of Rome, and again the second time neere to Verona setteth vpon him, and putting him &amp; his forces to flight, followeth him to Rauenna, where he besiegeth him continually for the space of three yeares together, but at length being forced to yeeld the city he was by him taken and put to death. Neither did this satisfie frowning Fortune that Rome was thus once or twise taken, sacked and consumed with fire, except the LONGOBARDI, <HI>Lombardes,</HI> a strange and cruell people do also inuade Italy, to deface and ouerthrow all things whatsoeuer the former enemies had left vntouched and standing. All things are now deformed and cast downe whatsoeuer in former times were most beautifull and glorious, the Romane citizen is compelled to forsake that ancient and famous title so long en∣ioied by them, and by meanes of this so irrecouerable a dammage the name of an Emperour was for euer banished out of Italy. The case thus stan∣ding with the Romanes, destitute of all helpe at home, and in vaine expecting the same from the Greeks, (who for their Empire contented them∣selues only with Constantinople) the Pope of Rome for defence of the Church was forced in this great distresse to entreat aid of Charles, king of the Frankes, who afterward was sirnamed CHARLES THE GREAT. This good king pricked on forward with a godly zeale for the mainte∣nance of Christian religion, passing with a great army ouer the Alpes, putteth the Lombards to flight, taketh their king Desiderius with his wife and children, vtterly ouerthroweth their kingdome and cleane extinguisheth that impious race. The Pope obseruing his inuincible courage, and his siugular loue that he bare to the Church and religion, with the generall consent and admirable applause of all men, in the yeare after Christs in∣carnation 801. crowneth him with the Imperiall diademe, and giueth him the title of AVGVSTVS and GREAT EMPEROVR of the West. This king was the first that of the Dutch was called Emperour, and that translated that dignity from the Greekes vnto the Germanes. He valiantly assailed the Hunnes, and at last with continuall wars so afflicted them that they were neuer after able to gather head againe. The Normanes, Frei∣ses, Danes, Angles, Saxons, and others molesting the Empire, he wonderfully vexed and weakened. Hauing on all sides greatly enlarged his Em∣pire, and for the space of fowreteene yeares swaied the scepter quietly at home, void of tumults and noise of warre, he committed the gouernment of the same to his sonne Lewis, sirnamed the Religious, and ended his life at Aquisgran. After the reigne of this Charles, the digni y and title of the Empire remained not amongst the Germanes without continuall warres and bloudshed, diuers kings coueting to annex the same to their crowne and nation, by dint of sword assaied by all meanes to bring their purpose to passe. To seat it amongst the French, Charles the Bald, spareth no cost, ventureth life and limme, and setteth all the world together by the eares: yet the Germanes valiantly fighting for the Imperiall ti le and dignity; do after many sore conflicts quite and cleane driue him out of Germany. Lewis the Fourth most furiously setteth vpon Berengarius an vsurper lately proclaimed Emperour in Italy, ouercommeth him in the field, and forceth him to betake him to his heeles. The Italians oft desired that this dignity once lost might againe be restored to them. (and no maruell: seeing that euery nation doth account it a most honourable thing to haue the name of an Empire resident amongst them.) Yet maugre all externall spite this dignity for many ages together remained in the hands of the Germanes, the Princes of this country manfully defending and preseruing it by force of armes from all iniuries and forren inuasions whatso∣euer. Vntill at length the forenamed Princes, foreseeing what was best for the state and good of the Empire, did chuse for their Emperor, Otto the Fourth, the naturall sonne of Otto the Third, a yong man brought vp at Rome, &amp; had been somtime in the custody and tuition of Henry Duke of Bayern. This Emperor perceiuing that it would not be an easie thing to appease and end the warres and controuersies that did arise about the ele∣ction and choice of the Emperor, except by some other meanes &amp; order this choice were made, did therefore inuent a certaine order and maner of election, whereby heereafter all cause of dissention and tumult, was wholly taken from all men, and by which for euer it might quietly be retai∣ned amongst the Germanes. This order is heere expressed in this Mappe, and is in effect thus much: In the first ranke are the Seuen PRINCE ELECTOVRS and Officers of the sacred Romane Empire, instituted by Otto the Third: whereof the Three vpon the right hand, are Ecclesiasti∣call persons or Churchmen, to wit, the ARCHBISHOP OF TRIER, (a city situate vpon the riuer Moselle) chiefe Chancellour for the Empire in the kingdome of France: The ARCHBISHOP OF COLEN, vpon the Rhein, Chiefe Chancellour in Italy; and the ARCHBISHOP OF MENTZ, Chiefe Chancellour in Germany: The other Foure vpon the left hand, are Secular or Lay men: the First, is the KING OF BOHE∣MIA, the Cup-bearer: the Second is the COVNTY PALATINE of Rhein, the Sewer: the Third is the DVKE OF SAXONY, the Sword-bearer: the Fourth is the MARQVESSE OF BRANDENBVRG, the Lord Great Chamberlaine to the Emperour. In the Second ranke doe follow, first the Foure Dukes of the Empire, to wit, the DVKE OF SVVITZERLAND, the DVKE OF BRVNSVVICKE, the DVKE OF BAYERN, and the DVKE OF LOREIN. Then vpon the left hand, the Foure MARQVESSES, <HI>videlicet,</HI> the MARQVISSE OF MEIS∣SEN, the MARQVESSE OF MORAVV, the MARQVESSE OF BADEN, and the MARQVESSE OF BRANDENBVRG. In the Third and last ranke do follow the Eight EARLES of the Empire: whereof the LANDTGRAVE OF DVRINGEN, the LANDGRAVE OF HESSEN, the Earles of LVCHTENBVRG, and of ALSATIA, are Earles Prouinciall: the other Foure, MEIDENBVRG, NVRVBERG, RENECK, and STOMEBVRG, are Earles Marshall or of the field.</P>

<HEAD>Of the FOVNDATION and ORDER of the GERMANE EMPIRE in the West. THE SECOND MAPPE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>TTO the Fourth, or, as some haue written, OTTO the Third, of whom wee haue spoken in the former Mappe, vnderstanding that Gregory the Fifth, Pope of Rome, whom he had not long since promoted to that dignity, was driuen out of his Sea, and Crescentius a Consul or Alderman of Rome by the Romanes made Emperour, passeth the Alpes with a great power, furiously assaulteth Italy, forceth the Romanes, and any other cities that had stood out against him for the aduerse part, to set open their gates and to yeeld themselues to his mercy. Crescentius, when he heard that the enemy was receiued into the city, was ex∣ceedingly amazed, and therefore betaketh himselfe with Pope Iohn, the vsurper which he had promoted to that dignity, vnto Adrians castle, which not long before he had fortified and repaired, for their last re∣fuge and succour. But being not able to sustaine the batterie and violent assaults which dayly the Empe∣rours souldiers made against him, at length yeeldeth the castle and himselfe to Otto: who presently com∣mandeth Crescentius the authour of this commotion to haue his eies put out, his nose cut off, and to be caried on horsebacke round about the towne with his face to the horsetaile: This being done his iudgement was to haue his hands and feet to be cut off, and at the townes end to be hanged vpon a paire of gallowes, where, before he was altogether dead, the souldiers do pitifully wound and man∣gle him from top to toe. Moreouer Pope Iohn, the vsurper, being displaced, Gregory vpheld and maintained by Otto, the Empe∣rours authority, climbeth vp againe into the Papall throne, from which before he had most iniuriously, by Crescentius, beene expel∣led. Then Gregory to requite the kindnesse of the Emperour and his Germanes, and withall that he might sufficiently reuenge him∣selfe of the Romanes for the intolerable wrongs that they had done vnto him, consulteth with the Emperour about a new law and forme of election of the Emperour, to be made by the Princes of Germany, that this choice might only and for euer remaine in their power, and againe that they should alwaies choose one of their corporation or body, as it were, vnto that dignity, which custome remaineth euen to these our daies duely kept and obserued. By vertue of this their choice, he is by and by vpon that their election to be called only, CAESAR and KING OF THE ROMANES, but hauing receiued the Imperiall diademe from the hands of the Pope, he was euer after to beare the title of IMPERATOR AVGVSTVS. But before these ordinances were published, Otto calling toge∣ther the Princes and States of Germany, shewed them how confusedly and disorderly the choice and election of the Emperor had hi∣therto beene made, and how many there haue beene, which haue assaied by all meanes possible to preferre their friends and kinsfolke vnto that dignity, which thing cannot but in continuance of time, breed great dissention and danger to the Christian common∣wealth: and that it were therefore good that some of the Princes of Germanie were chosen, which might haue the whole power and authority of this election; and withall admonisheth them, that the fewer there were of those Electours, so much lesse the contention would be that should arise about the choice. Moreouer he endeuoured to perswade them that these Electours might bee appointed and taken out of the Peeres and Officers of the Empire, for that they of all other best knew what was good for the body and state of that kingdome and empire. All men generally liking of that course and counsell by him proposed, the Emperour and the Pope nomi∣nated vnto them first, <HI>Three ecclesiasticall Princes,</HI> bishops of Germany, which they wished might be the Lord Chiefe Chancellours of the Empire, to wit, <HI>The bishop of Mentz,</HI> for all matters in Germany; <HI>The bishop of Colen,</HI> for Italy; <HI>The bishop of Trier,</HI> for France; To these they adioined <HI>Foure Secular Princes,</HI> which should in all things aid the Emperour, attend vpon his person, and that should acknowledge him for their Lord and Monarch of the World: viz. <HI>The Duke of Saxony,</HI> Sword bearer to his Maiesty, signifying that hee is the fountaine of Iustice: <HI>The Marquesse of Brandenburgh,</HI> Lord Great Chamberlaine: <HI>The County Palatine of Rhein,</HI> Sewer: and <HI>The K ng of Bohemia,</HI> Cup-bearer: these were to attend vpon the Emperour and to gard his person. By these the King of the Romans was chosen, the Caesar (or he that was next to be Emperour) was appointed: in their hands the whole right, interest and authority of choosing that king resided, lest any man heereafter, as heeretofore had beene vsuall, should challenge this dignity vnto himselfe as due by inheritance from his ancestours. Charles the Fourth many yeares after this comprised this instrument or act into a bullion or tablet of gold, which to this day is extant, wherein hee explaned euery particular more expresly and significantly. It is reported that this ordinance was decreed vpon, and made in the yeare of Grace 1001 and did much discontent the Frenchmen, who tooke it hei∣nously as a great indignity offered vnto them. Yet beside these there were then, and afterward in succedent ages were, made many and sundry other ordinances and decrees in the Romane Empire, and diuers other Offices appointed and erected for the state and greater maiesty of the Empire. For beside these seuen <HI>Electours,</HI> there were appointed, Foure <HI>Dukes,</HI> Foure <HI>Marquesses,</HI> Foure <HI>Landt∣graues,</HI> Foure <HI>Burggraues,</HI> Foure <HI>Earles,</HI> Foure <HI>Barons,</HI> Foure <HI>Knights</HI> of the field, Foure <HI>Cities,</HI> Foure <HI>Villages,</HI> and Foure <HI>Yeomen</HI> or Rusticks, all which offices we haue expressed in their true characters in these two mappes appointed for that purpose only. Notwith∣standing other Emperours following, not content with these constitutions and ordinances, haue daiely made new Dukes and Earles, yea and many that were but Earles before they haue aduanced to the title and honour of Dukes. To these forenamed dignities, that they might, as much as was possible, strengthen the state of the Empire, they haue adioined certaine other new officers, to wit these which follow: Foure HIGH MARSHALS, as <HI>Bappenheim, Gulich, Meissen,</HI> and <HI>Vnistingen:</HI> Foure LORDS OF THE SOILE, <HI>Mil∣lan, Scala, Padua,</HI> and <HI>Mirandula:</HI> Foure BORROVGHS of the Empire, <HI>Aldenburgh, Meidenburgh, Rotenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Mecklenburgh:</HI> Foure KNIGHTS or Seruants, <HI>Waldeck, Hirten</HI> of Fulchen, <HI>Arnsperg,</HI> and <HI>Rabnaw:</HI> Foure SOVLDIERS, <HI>Andlaw, Meldingen, Stron∣decke,</HI> and <HI>Fornberg:</HI> Foure LORD ABBOTS, <HI>Fulden, Campidon, Wissenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Murbach:</HI> Foure HVNTSMEN, <HI>Hurn, Vrach, Scomburgh,</HI> and <HI>Metsch</HI> neere to Curia: Foure VILLAGES, <HI>Ingelheim, Altdorff, Lichtenaw,</HI> and <HI>Deckendorff:</HI> Foure MOVNTAINS of the Empire, <HI>Nunsterberg, Friedberg, Heydelberg,</HI> and <HI>Nurnberg:</HI> Foure OFFICES hereditary to the Dukedome of Switzerland, <HI>The Sewer of Waldprugh, The Cupbearer of Radach, The Marshall of Merkdorff, and The Chamberlaine of Kemnat.</HI> Yer many of these di∣gnities are altered and changed into others, or wholly abolished and extinct by the death of those which held them, as it is at large to be seene in Munsters Cosmography. If any man be moreouer desirous to know the names of the Imperiall cities, let him repaire to the same authour, he shalbe satisfied to his full content. Item Charles the Fourth, Emperour of Germany did make besides these many other constitutions. When the Emperour sitteth in his Maiesty and chaire of Estate then the Archbishop of Trier sitteth ouer against him, the Archbishop of Mentz vpon his right hand, and the Archbishop of Colen on his left: The King of Bohemia taketh his seat vpon the right hand of the Archbishop, and by him the County palatine of Rhein placeth himselfe, the Duke of Saxony sit∣teth vpon the left hand of the Archbishop, and by him the Marquesse of Brandenburgh. But of these offices, diuers authours do write diuersly; wherefore it being not our purpose to make a large discourse of this matter, we send the Reader, for further satisfaction heer∣in, to the forenamed Sebastian Munster and other Historiographers of Germany, who haue handled this argument more amply.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGS MONASTERY of Saint Laurence, for Friars of the order of Saint Hierome, <HI>in Escuriall in Spaine.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>Ld stories do much talke of seuen wonders of the World, whereof hitherto it hath much bragged, yet notwithstanding they, (such is the mutability of fortune) at this day are all consumed, and by tract of time; brought to nothing, so that now there remaineth not any monument or mention of them at all. This our age also hath certaine wonders and strange things equall or superiour to the most of those. Spaine, amongst other, hath a most stately and princely building, a worthy worke of the Catholike King, of in∣finite cost and charges consecrated to holy and religious vses; to wit, a Church, not such as that was in Asia, sometime dedicated to the Ephesian Diana, and at last set on fire and defaced by Herostratus, but one as gorgeous and sumptuous as that, consecrated to Saint Laurence, that zealous Martyr and glory of the Spanish nation, of whom they crake so much. The cause of the dedication, as they say, was a vow. For in the voiage vnto Saint Quintins, the Metropolitane and chiefe city of Vermandois, vndertaken by the Catholike King, Philip the second, of the house of Austrich, against Henry the second, the French King, there was a notable battell fought betweene the Frenchmen and the Burgundians, in the yeare of our Lord 1557. Vpon the tenth day of August, in which the flower of chiualrie and chiefe Nobility of France being slain and ouercome, the victory fell vnto Philip and his Burgundians: which victory was such, as I am not able to say whether the house of Austrich euer saw a greater or not. This day euery yeere is kept holy for Saint Laurence the Martyr, to whom and his good praiers this good Prince doth thinke himselfe beholding for this victory. There∣fore, the King, assoone as he was returned home, remembring his vow, tooke care for nothing more then to performe his promise made to God and his holy Martyr Saint Laurence. Therefore he performeth the same very magnificently, and most bountifullie laieth on cost, bestoweth many yeares and almost infinite treasures vpon this worke: so that now it is not onely one, and that a most gorgeous and stately Monastery, but foure, according to the number of the corners of the building, beside a maruellous princely Palace with a Library well stored with diuers and sundry ancient manuscripts and rare bookes. The village, which by reason of the great multitudes of labourers and workemen which resorted thither of all trades, now is become a pretty towne, commonly called ESCVRIAL (<HI>Escuriacum,</HI> in Latine) is fiue miles from Madrid, an ancient city which Ptolemey in his time called <HI>Mantua Carpeta∣norum.</HI> Round about it are diuers very steepe and high hils, out of which almost all the stone was digged, that was vsed about this building. The Friars which do inhabite and possesse these Monasteries are of the order of Saint Hierome, who very deuoutly euery day at nine of the clocke in the quire of that Church do sing Psalmes and powre out their praiers to Almighty God for the health and preseruation of all Christian Princes. There also the King hath erected an Vniuersity, and hath allowed large maintenance not onelie for the Professors and Readers of Diuinity, Philosophy and other liberall sciences: but also for the scholars and students of the same. Yet it is a place of no great resort, being of purpose built a good way distant from the high rode way, lest the great resort thither of strangers, which oft times commeth to passe, should corrupt the maners and minds of the students, or alienate them from their books. But let vs come to some particulars heere well worth the obseruation. Within the inner Court, on the foreside of this building, you shall see a goodly cloister or walke couered ouer head, which beginning at the West side of the Abbey, runneth all along by the North side, paued with small stones partly round and partly square. The foreside and chiefe shew of this Abbey is toward the West, and in the foure corners of this building there are foure turrets. Ouer the fore-dore of this Church, vpon their seuerall footstals doe stand the statues or counterfets of the sixe kings of Israel carued out of white marble and blacke touchstone, each of them being eigh∣teene foot high. The great porch of this Abbey vpheld and standing vpon pillars of Ionicke and Doricke worke is all of Geat or blacke Agate. Vpon the North side there is a Courtyard, through which they go to the Kings palace, the foure walkes of the Col∣ledge and the Vniuersitie: all which are built vpon this North side. Here also you shall see some of the shops and worke-houses of those handicrafts, tradesmen and others that do belong aswell to the Church and Colledge as to the Monasterie. On the South side also are certaine gardens, orchardes, the walke belonging to the Hospitall, certaine Stilling houses, with an Apothecaries shop and a gallery by which they passe from the Monastery vnto the guessen parlour. Let vs come now vnto the inner ornaments of this state∣ly peece of work. And first, with the staires by which they go vp from the great doore of the Church, a goodly gallery, which leadeth vnto the open walke which is betweene the Colledge and the Monastery, doth offer it selfe to thy view. In this gallery you may go vp by a broad paire of staires to go into the Church, and from thence you come vnto another floore, which leadeth to the crosse en∣try which is before the Church, from whence they of the Monastery go one way, those of the Colledge another way, into the church, and so from thence into the lower roome of the Quire. The place or platforme of this Quire is square, hauing within the square three Cloisters. By this place of the lower Quire on each side there is an open Court, from whence the lower Quire and the two Chap∣pels situate by this Court, do receiue their light. In this Quire there are two stately Altars. Ouer this Quire, which is arched, there is another Church with a Quire belonging to it. Which Church beside the great Chappell, the Inner and Outter roomes of the Quire, is square, standing vpon foure pillars, and other necessarie staies and vpholders. In it are two paire of Organes, each of them hauing, as they terme them, two and thirty Registers. Moreouer in this Churh are six and thirty Altars, with a most stately Dore, by which they go vnto the great lower Vault, at such time as praiers are said. This Church is thirty foot higher then the lower Quire: and the vpper Quire is as many foot higher, then the Church it selfe. The floore is laid checkerwise with white marble and a kind of blacke stone, in like maner as the floores of the outter and inner Quires are: Heere are to be seene diuers and sundry Seruice bookes and Masse bookes, both written and printed, with others many belonging to such Church businesses. In the roofe of this Quire the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres and all the hoast of heauen are most curiously painted, like as also vpon the wals of the same the coun∣terfets of diuers vertues are so cunningly portraitured as one would thinke them to be liue persons, beside certaine histories of Saint LAVRENCE and S. HIEROME. The Seates are made of very fine wood, carued and set out with turned pillars of Corinthiacke worke most artificially. Vpon the South side of the Church is the Porch doore beautified and adorned with diuers and sundrie goodly pi∣ctures. In this Porch is a Fountaine made of diuers kinds of iasper and marble, running at seuen cockes for the vse and benefit of such as are purposed to go to Masse there. The floore is paued and garnished with blacke and white marble. The Vestrie also is a very stately place, and richlie adorned, in which are diuers coffers and chests wherein are laid vp and kept the copes, vestments and other ornaments belonging to the altars and Priests which they put on when they say Masse. Out of this vestry they go vp to the high altar which standeth vp a loft in the vpper end of the Church. The place where this altar standeth is paued with the best iasper stone of di∣uers colours. To this are adioning certaine Chappels and closets where the Noblemen and Princes do sit to heare masse. This way

<PB REF="328"/> they goe into the chappell which is vpon the North side of the church, where diuers pretious reliques of Saints are kept inclosed in their seuerall chests and boxes. Such another there is for all the world vpon the South side. Hard by the high altar there is a little roome most richly adorned, where the holy communion is administred. Within this roome by the high altar there is a closet, where the Sacrament is kept and reserued, set out most statelily with seuen pillars, of the best iasper, and the statues of the twelue Apostles, as curiously wrought as arte might deuise. The Doores of this closet made of the best and purest Crystall, which they call Crystall of the mountaine, are enclosed and hanged in certaine hinges of cast mettal double gilt and laid ouer with gold. This work is thought to be the most curious and artificiall that elsewhere is to be seene in all the world. The suruey or and famous architect of this building, Master Ieames Trezzo, was sixe whole yeares at the least in cutting and polishing of the iasper which was vsed in this worke onely. Moreouer the high altar is a worke as costly and curious as this, made in like maner of iasper and marble, and garnished with sundry stately pictures and statues.</P>
<P>The MONASTERIE, or place of residence for the monkes and friars, hath a very goodly <HI>Steeple</HI> wherein doe hang a fine ring of <HI>Bels,</HI> with a <HI>Clocke</HI> and <HI>Diall,</HI> with an Index shewing the Naturall and Planetary howres. The Wardrope, Hall or Roome where the monkes and friars do vse to dine and suppe, with the spittle, are most goodlily built with Sollers, Galleries and Walkes. Moreouer heere is a faire Cloister or Square, where publike praiers are daily read: In the middest of this square is a very fine garden most artifi∣cially diuided into beds and curious knots. In the middest of it is a goodly piece of worke, built eight square in maner of a temple, with fountaines of the best iasper. To this Cloister is adioining the Chapter-house, with another roome very like vnto it. The Seats of the monkes are round about by the sides: but the Seat of the Priour doth farre excell the rest, a famous piece of worke made of marble, gloriously set out with pictures, and curiously arched ouer the head. The LIBRARY which is vpon the toppe of the Abbey, is 185. foot long, and 32. foot broad. It hath three sundrie roomes; In the first are all the Liberall Sciences protraitured. At the feet of euery picture, are the Bookes of that facultie very orderly and finely placed, all of them gilt, and bound alike. Heere also is an huge Parchment booke, wherein all manner of liuing creatures that are in all the whole world, elsewhere to be seene, are most curiouslie drawen and expressed in their true and liuely colours. In the Second are onely manuscript Latine, Greeke and Hebrew bookes of Di∣uinity. In the beginning of euery booke is set the picture and counterfet of the authour of the same. In like maner the third roome is furnished only with manuscript copies of sundrie writers, and different argument in diuers languages, to wit, Historiographers, Po∣ets, Mathematicians &amp;c. These also haue, where they might possibly be gotten, the liuely portraitures and counterfets of their au∣thours set before them. This Library was much augmented by the addition of the Library of Didacus Hurtadus Mendoza, who ha∣uing sometime beene Ambassadour for Charles the fifth, Emperour of Rome, vnto the Venetians, receiued from the High country of Greece a ship full of manuscript Greeke copies: so that excepting the Vaticane in Rome, which is the Popes Library, there is not, as most men thinke, a more stately and better furnished library then this in all Europe.</P>
<P>I come now to the VNIVERSITY, and the KINGS PALLACE, both which are vpon the North side. In the VNIVERSITY there are three seuerall Schooles or Hals, where the three most famous and worthy artes <HI>Diuinity, Law</HI> and <HI>Physicke</HI> are read by their seuerall and proper Lecturers, beside the other liberall Sciences which together with them are there taught and expounded vnto the yonger sort of students. To this is adioined a Free Schoole for Grammar scholars, with sundry other court yards, and hals or dining roomes.</P>
<P>The PALACE is so situate, that from thence you may easily goe vnto the Church, the Colledge and monastery. It were a long discourse particularly to describe the seuerall lodgings of the King, the Ambassadours, Comptroulers, Chamberlaines, Noblemens, Pensioners, Yeomen of the guard and other Officers belonging to the Court. The Kings Gallery openeth toward the North side of the Church, vpon whose wall is painted the battell at Higueruela, in which King Iohn the Second ouercame the Moores of Grana∣do. Which picture doth so liuelily expresse the whole story and euery thing in it as it was done, as it is wonderfull. It sheweth in what order, and how the maine battell was set, where the Horsemen, the Footmen, the Pikemen, the Targeters, the Archers, which then were in great request, did stand, and how and where they seuerally charged the enemy. This piece of worke was made at the commandement of Philip the second, king of Spaine, by an old patterne drawen in a piece of linnen cloth of an hundred and thirtie foot long, found in the old Towre of Segouia, which was first drawen at that time that this battell was fought. Moreouer vpon the East and South sides of this building there is a most goodly and pleasant Garden, which is an hundred foot broad, and is set out and beautified with diuerse knots, rare hearbs, floures and fountaines. To this garden is adioined an Orchard planted and set with all ma∣ner of trees. Within the precincts of this monastery there are more then forty fountaines. Such is the wonderfull number of Keies and Lockes about this house, which do amount vnto certaine thousands, that there is a seueral and proper Officer for to looke to them onely, called, The master of the Keies. The forme of the monastery is foure-square, and euery side is two hundred and twenty foure pases long; only that side except that is next to the Pallace, which of purpose was made shorter then the other three, that the compasse or externall forme of the Abbey might represent the fashion of the square of a gridiron, for that S. Laurence, to whom this house was dedicated, was broiled to death vpon a gridiron. The Monkes which are in number three hundred, and as I haue she∣wed before, of the order of S. Hierome, do inhabite not past the third part of this whole building. Their yearly reuenews do amount to 35000. Duckets. The other part of the reuenewes they doe bestow vpon the king and his family. That I may conclude, it is fur∣nished with so many Hals, Parlours, Chambers and other closets and roomes for necessary vses in an house, that there is roome inough to entertaine and lodge fowre Kings and their Courts at once, to that it may worthily challenge the first place amongst the greatest miracles of the whole world.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Iraldus Cambrensis, a good Writer, that liued in the time of Henry the Second, &amp; wrote aboue 400 yeeres since, describeth IRELAND on this maner: HIBERNIA, saith he, <HI>post Britan∣niam, insularum maxima, vnius contractioris diei nauigatione vltra Britannicas VVallias, in occidentali Oce∣ano sita est. Intra tamen Vltoniam &amp; Scoticas Galwedias duplo ferè angustiore spacio mare coarctatur. Vtra{que} verò vtriusque terrae promontoria, hinc distinctius, illinc ratione distantiae confusius, satis apertè sereno tempore perspici possunt &amp; notari. Insularum occidentalium haec vltima. Hispaniam, ab Austro, trium dierum naturali∣um nauigatione, collateralem habet: Britanniam Maiorem, ab Oriente: Solum Oceanum, ab Occidente: Ab Aqui∣lonari verò parte, trium dierum velifico cursu, borealium insularum maxima Islandia iacet.</HI> That is: IRE∣LAND, the greatest iland of the world but Britaine, lieth in the maine sea, distant Westward from Wales about a dayes saile: but betweene Vlster and Gallaway, a prouince of Scotland, the Sea is not much more than halfe so farre ouer. The promontories, capes, or forlands (as you please to call them) of both these countries, may very easily, in a bright sunne-shinie day, from hence be seene and descried: yet these more plainer, those, by reason they are farther off, more obscurely. Of all the ilands of Europe this lieth farthest into the West. Vpon the South side it hath Spaine, distant from it about three dayes and three nights saile. Vpon the East lieth Great Britaine. On the West side of it is nothing but the vast Ocean sea. Vpon the North, three daies iourney off, lieth Island, which of all the Northren iles is by farre the greatest. Againe, a little beneath he addeth: <HI>Hibernia quantò à caetero &amp; communi Orbe terrarum semota, &amp; quasi</HI> ALTER ORBIS <HI>esse dignoscitur: tantò rebus quibusdam, solito naturae cursu, incognitis, quasi peculiaris eiusdem</HI> NATV∣RAE THESAVRVS, <HI>vbi insignia &amp; pretiosiora sui secreta reposuerit, esse videtur.</HI> Looke by how much Ireland is disioy∣ned from the rest of the knowen world, and in that respect is commonly holden to be as it were ANOTHER WORLD: so, for certeine things, by the common course of Nature, to others vnknowen, it seemeth to be a spe∣ciall and peculiar Treasurie or STOREHOVSE OF NATVRE, where it hath bestowed and layed vp her most excellent and rarest secrets. Orosius (and Isidore from him) reporteth, That Ireland is much lesse than England, but by reason of the situation, and temperature of the aire here, it is generally more fertile than England. Yea and reue∣rend Beda, our country man, he sayth, That the aire in Ireland is more healthfull and cleare than it is in England. <HI>(Hi∣berniam tum aëris salubritate, quàm serenitate multum Britanniae praestare.)</HI> Yet Giraldus denieth the latter. For (sayth he) as France for thinnesse and clearnesse of the aire doth far excell England, so England for the same doth as far excell Ire∣land. For, this is certaine, the farther you go Eastward, looke by how much the aire is more subtile, pure and thinne, so much is it more fierce, sharpe and piercing. On the contrary, the farther you go toward the South and West parts of the world, by how much the aire is more thicke, cloudy and foggy, by so much it is more temperate, kinde and healthfull. For this countrey, lying in the midst indifferently seated betweene frozen Island, and parched Spaine, and by that meanes getting a meane temperature betweene hot and cold, aswell in respect of that temperature and hole∣somnesse of the aire, is a most goodly &amp; fertile iland. The champion fields do yeeld great store of corne; the moun∣taines do feed many heards of cattell, the woods affoord many Deere and other kind of wild beasts, the lakes and ri∣uers great variety and plenty of good fish. Yet the soile of this iland is better for Pastorage than Arable-ground; for Grasse than Corne. <HI>Multam fruges in Hibernia,</HI> saith he, <HI>plurimam in culmis, minorem in granis spem promittunt. Abundè satis &amp; campi vestiuntur, &amp; horrea farciuntur, sola verò granaria destituuntur.</HI> Here their corne, as long as it is in the grasse (for <HI>Hiber∣nia</HI> I read <HI>herba</HI>) is maruellous good, but much better it seemeth to be when it is shot vp and spindled, only it faileth when it commeth to the threshing, then it is seldome found to be casty. In the field it maketh a goodly shew, yea ordinarily it is as thicke as may stand vpon the ground, their barnes are crammed full and mowed vp to the top, only their garners are empty. Thus farre Giraldus: and because we haue handled the generall description of this iland in another place of this our worke, we will conclude this discourse with a briefe description of some few of their cities and principall townes, as we haue learned of that worthy gentleman Richard Stanihurst, this countreyman bredde and borne. DVBLIN, situate vpon the riuer Liffe, in the countie of Dublin, the Metropolitan and chiefe citie not only of Leynster, but also of all Ireland, for goodly faire buildings, multitude of people, ciuility, for sweet aire and si∣tuation, doth as farre excell all the other cities of this ile, as the lofty cypresse doth the lowest shrubs. The <HI>Cathedrall church</HI> of S. Patricks was first founded by Iohn Cinim Archbishop of Dublin, in the yere of our Lord God 1197. That great and goodly strong <HI>Castle</HI> was built by Henry Loundres Archbishop also of Dublin, about the yere of our Lord 1220. This city is very ancient, and was in Ptolemeys time (as learned men thinke) called <HI>Ciuitas Eblana,</HI> The city Eb∣lan. The next city in order and dignity is WATERFORD, a well gouerned towne, and one that hath been alwaies faithfull to England. It is very populous and ciuill, and (for that the hauen here is far better and more safe than that of Dublin) much resorted vnto for trade and trafficke, by merchants of forren countreys. The streets of it are very narrow and darke. Here no cutthroat-Iewish vsurer is permitted to vse his diuellish occupation, that is, as Cato sayd, to kill men, or to liue by the sweat of other mens browes. The third is LIMMERICK, which in regard of the good∣ly riuer Shenyn whereupon it is seated and standeth, as also for the commodious situation of the same, might iustly challenge the first place. For this riuer is the greatest and goodliest of all Ireland, whose depth and channell is such, that notwithstanding the city standeth at the least threescore miles from the maine sea, yet ships of great burden doe come vp euen to the towne walles: besides that it is woonderfully stored with great variety of fresh fish. King Iohn did like the situation of this city so well, that he caused there a goodly castle and faire bridge to be built. The last and least is CORCK, situate vpon the riuer Leigh. This hauen is one of the best in all Ireland, and therefore the citizens are very wealthy and great merchants. These three latter are all within the prouince of Mounster. But if thou desi∣rest a larger discourse of these particulars, I wish thee to repaire to the foresayd authour Richard Stanihurst, he shall satisfie thee to the full.</P>

He liued, as I gather, aboue fiue hundred yeeres since, presently after the entrance of the Normans into England: For at the second se∣ction of the fourth climate he writeth that when he wrote this his worke, Roger was King of Sicilia: but whether this Roger were Roger the fa∣ther, sonne of Tanchred the Norman, who draue the Saracens from thence; or Roger his sonne, who in the yeere after Christs incarnation 1103 tooke vpon him the gouernment of that kingdome, it is vncertaine, and (for ought I know) not to be learned out of his words.</P>

Neither is this any strange thing, not vsed by any other: for Raymundus Marlianus, that adioyned those Alphabeticall descriptions of Cities, Places, Mountaines and Riuers, to Caesars Com∣mentaries, doth put <HI>Angliam Insulam</HI> and <HI>Angliae Insulam,</HI> The Ile England and The Ile of England, for <HI>Britanniam,</HI> Britaine. Such is the maruel∣lous greatnesse of this Iland, that when it was first descried by the Romans, they thought it almost well woorthy the name of ALTERIVS OR∣BIS, <HI>Another world.</HI> And he that made the Panegyricke oration to Constantius, writeth that Iulius Caesar, who first discouered it to the Romans, ALIVM <HI>se</HI> ORBEM TERRARVM <HI>scripserit reperisse, tantae magnitudinis arbitratus, vt non circumfusa Oceano, sed complexa Oceanum videretur,</HI> did write vnto his friends, that he had found Another World; supposing it to be of that wonderfull greatnesse, that it could nor possibly be inui∣roned round on all sides of the sea, but rather that it contrariwise did enclose the sea. And for that it lieth so farre remote from the South, like as Thule, it was by poets and other ancient writers, intituled <HI>Vltima Britannia,</HI> Great Britaine, the farthest part of the world Northward.</P>
<P><SUP>d</SUP> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Alnaama,</HI> In Auicen is a fowle called of the Latines, <HI>Struthium,</HI> an Ostrich; as Gerardus Cremonensis, his interpretour, vnderstan∣deth the word: and indeed the South part of the ile, the sea falling in betweene Wales and Cornwall, doth represent the necke and head of such a like fowle, with the mouth gaping wide open. Liuy and Fabius Rusticus did liken it <HI>Oblongae scutulae, vel bipennt,</HI> To aswingling stocke or sword, which those vse that dresse hempe and flax; to a twall or twibill, a kinde of warlike weapon vsed in fight by some nations. And indeed the whole iland being triangular (<HI>triquetra,</HI> they call it) but of vnequall sides, (which kinde of figure the Geometers call <HI>Scalenum</HI>) may also aswell as Sicilia be named TRINACRIA. For from <HI>Taruisium,</HI> a promontory or forland in Scotland, now called Howburne, all along by the shore, vnto <HI>Be∣lerium,</HI> the cape of Cornwall, are 812. miles: from whence to <HI>Cantium,</HI> The Forland of Kent, are 320 miles: from thence againe to Howburne in Scotland, 704 miles. So that by this account the circuit and compasse of Britaine is 1836 miles: which commeth much short of that account of Pliny, and is somewhat lesse than that of Caesar.</P>
<P><SUP>e</SUP> The first inhabitants which seated themselues heere presently after the vniuersall floud in the dayes of Noe, came hither from France, as Necrenesse of place, Likenesse of maners, Gouernment, Customes, Name and Language, doe very demonstratiuely prooue and euince. And thereupon they call themselues <HI>Cumro,</HI> as come from <HI>Gomer</HI> the sonne of Iapheth (called of Historiographers <HI>Cimber</HI>) from whom are descended the <HI>Celiae</HI> or ancient Gauls, the inhabitants not only of France, but generally of all the Northwest parts of Europe. What thinke you then of that story of Brute? Mary I thinke he wanted honesty that first inuented that fable, and he wit that beleeueth it. But Iohn Wheathamsted, some∣time Abbat of S. Albans, a graue learned man and of good iudgement, shall speake for me; <HI>Totus iste processus,</HI> saith he, <HI>de Bruto, poëticus est potius quàm historicus, opinatiuus{que} magis propter varias causas, quàm realis:</HI> That whole discourse of Brute, is rather to be accounted as a fable and fiction forged in poets braine, then a true history, done and acted indeed. Item William of Newbury, a writer of good credit, and one that liued at the same time with this Geffrey of Munmouth, did accuse him to his face of forgery, and challenged him for the same. For first, for the name of Bri∣tons they neuer knew what it meant vntill the entrance of the Romans, and was then as harsh vnto these <HI>Cumbri,</HI> as the name of <HI>Welchman,</HI> is to them at this day; which it is certeine diuers of the vpland people do not acknowledge nor vnderstand what it should meane. Againe, Ludouicus Vines, Hadrianus Iunius, Buchanan, Polydore Virgil, Bodine and other great men, do all iointly confesse that there was neuer in the world any such man as this Brutus. Moreouer, That presently after the confusion at Babell, in the infancy of the world, when the iles of the Gentiles were diuided into their lands, as the Scripture speaketh, euery man after his tongue, after their families in their nations, that is, That such men as by rea∣son of difference and diuersity of language, did separate themselues from such as they vnderstood not, and therefore could not conuerse withall, into their seuerall companies and hords, did beare the name and denomination of their father and prince of that family, it is very plaine and mani∣fest: but that any nation was named or called after the name of the chiefe leader and conductour of a colony, I yet find not auouched by any good authour. It is most certaine and without all controuersie true, That diuers countries haue beene called by sundry names, by forreners and stran∣gers, neuer knowen nor acknowledged of the nations themselues. Do you thinke that the ancient inhabitants of Spaine did euer know what <HI>He∣speria</HI> meant? None surely euer called that countrey by this name, but the Graecians only. <HI>Albion</HI> and <HI>Britannia</HI> doubtlesse were names as barba∣rous vnto these our <HI>Cumbri,</HI> and neuer heard of before the entrance of the Romans. There is no Colony, although neuer so small and few, but will reteine much of their owne countrey language, either wholly vncorrupt, or els manifestly to be distinguished by the phrase and proprietie of speech. Those few Flemmings who (their countrey being by the breaking in of the sea ouerflowen and drowned) obteined of King Henrie the first, a part of Penbrooke shire in Wales which the Welchmen call Rosse, lying betweene two riuers, not farre off from Milford hauen, are they not to this day distinguished, from their neighbours round about them by their speech and language? And because their speech doth much re∣semble the English, is not their countrey commonly called, of those which inhabit neere vnto them, <HI>Little England beyond Wales?</HI> The like you shall obserue by the British colony, which aboue eleuen hundred yeeres since tooke possession of that part of France, which of them euer since hath beene knowen by the name of Britaine: Of the colony of the Scots in Ireland, and of the Irish in Scotland. If any man will say that there is the like resemblance betweene the Welch tongue and the Greeke or Latine, I will iustifie it that there is as great affinitie betweene the Welch and Arabicke, and againe that these are as like the one to other as an apple is to an oister. Moreouer, this entrance of Brute was an absolute con∣quest, the giants (if there were euer any such) being vtterly destroyed or quite chaced out of the land, and therefore there is no reason to the con∣trary but they should haue, for the space of seuen hundred yeeres, kept their language from corruption, as well as they haue done since, being since the entrance of the Romans sixteene hundred yeeres and more. The Latines or Greeks so prodigall alwayes in their owne commendation, would doubtlesse not haue forgotten to record the setting forth of such a famous colony. Could this affinity haue beene hid from Caesar? would they not, thinke you, haue claimed kindred of the Romans? Constans and Constantius Emperours of Rome were the first, by the testimony of Iu∣lius Firmicus, that euer durst venture thorow these seas. How then did this Brutus, so many hundred yeeres before, in such small barks, so slightly built, passe the same? Aeneas, they report, of his many ships lost all but one before he could get home, in the Midland sea, which is nothing so dangerous and troublesome. Can it be thought credible that such a warlike nation as these Troians, hauing so lately got footing and seated them∣selues in so goodly a countrey as Italy, would so suddenly remoue so farre off, to a place vnknowen? The Romans hauing such dangerous warres, and such occasion to vse men and braue commanders, would neuer haue suffered them in such troopes to passe out of their countrey. If it had tooke the name of Brutus, it should doubtlesse haue been called Brutania, not Britannia, as Caesar nameth it, nor Bretania, Pretanice, or Pretanis, as the Greeks do write it. But list what Caesar sayth of this matter, <HI>Britania pars interior,</HI> sayth he, <HI>ab ijs incolitur, quos natos in insula ipsi memoria pro∣ditum dicunt. Maritima pars ab ijs, qui praedae ac belli inferendi causa ex Belgio transierant.</HI> The inner part of the ile is inhabited of such people as were bred and borne there, as they themselues do report from their ancestours. The sea coast is possessed of such as haue come thither from Flanders and thereabout, to robbe and spoile the countrey. If this were all that was then knowen, and that Gildas Sapiens and Venerabilis Beda knew no∣thing to the contrary, how came this our authour, so many hundred yeeres after them, to the knowledge of this so absolute an history, where not only persons, places, and actions are so distinctly set downe with their precise difference of time, as if they had beene done but yesterday? The historian, for things done in his owne time, or not long before, is beleeued vpon his owne word, but for such things as were done many ages be∣fore he was borne, he must bring his author to iustifie his assertion. If there had beene any such tradition commonly deliuered from man to man, it would questionlesse haue beene intimated to Caesar. Records can not be preserued but by writing; and that knowledge came in with the Ro∣mans. But if it be a question whether there were euer any such city as that Troy, so much renowmed by meanes of that learned poëme of the fa∣mous Poët Homer, what will become of the stories of Aeneas (which, if I mistake him not, the great Historiographer Titus Liuius doth make a doubt of) and of this our Brutus neuer patronaged by any great learned wise man? I know that is improued by some, and I thinke it may be de∣monstrated. For further satisfaction I referre thee to M. Camdens Britannia, where this argument is handled at large and most learnedly. Only in defence of Gaulfridus, lest any man should thinke that I haue all this while spoken against his person, I conclude with this sayng of a learned man of our time; <HI>Cardanus ait,</HI> sayth he, <HI>illius aetatis scriptores tantopere mendacio &amp; fabulis fuisse delectatos, vt in contentionem venerint quis plura con∣fingeret.</HI> Cardane sayth, That the Historians and Writers of those times (betweene foure hundred and fiue hundred yeeres since) were so much delighted with fables and lies, that they stroue who should lie fastest, and win the whetstone. It was, you see, the fault of the time and age where∣in he liued, not of the man. The learned Oratour Tully, in the second booke of his Offices, as I remember, thus describeth the vertues of a true
<PB REF="332"/> Historiographer: <HI>Ne quid falsi scribere audeat; Ne quid veri non audeat; Ne quam in scribendo suspitionem gratiae; Ne quam simultatis ostendat.</HI> A good Historian may not dare to write any thing that is false; He may not be afrayd to write any thing that is true; He must not shew any partiality or fauour in writing; He ought to be void of all affection and malice. Learned Antiquaries follow this good counsell of the graue Philosopher; Sell vs no more drosse for pure mettall; Refine what you reade and write; Euery tale is not true that is tolde: Some authours want iudgement; others honesty: Let no man be beleeued for his antiquity: For you know what Menander sayd, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; Grayhaires are not alwayes a signe of wisdome and deepe vnderstanding; olde men do sometime dote, and will lie as well as others. One sayth; <HI>Nesc to quo casu illud euenit, vt falsa potius quàm vera animum nostrum captant.</HI> I cannot tell, sayth he, how it commeth to passe, but surely true it is, that we are more easily caried away with lies and fables, than with truth. And how hard a matter it is to remoue one from a setled opinion, though neuer so false and absurd, any man meanly experienced doth very well know.</P>
<P><SUP>f</SUP> Yet Caesar saith that <HI>Britanniae Loca sunt temperatiora, qùam in Gallia, remissioribus frigoribus:</HI> The temperature of the aire in England, is better then in France, the cold is nothing so bitter. That is, as the authour of the Panegyricke oration made to Constantius the Emperour doth inter∣pret it, <HI>In ea nec rigor est nimius hyemis, nec ardor aestatis:</HI> In it neither the cold of winter, nor the heat of summer is very excessiue. And Minutius Felix hee writeth that, <HI>Britannia sole deficitur, sed circumfluentis maris tepore recreatur.</HI> In England the Sunne shineth not very hotte, but that de∣fect is repaied by a certaine steame or hot vapour which ascendeth vp out of the sea that inuironeth this iland on all sides round.</P>
<P><SUP>g</SUP> What place this should be, I dare not for truth constantly affirme, Perhaps he meaneth <HI>Vitsam,</HI> or as we call it <HI>Whitsan,</HI> a little towne in the country of Bolloine some fiue or six miles from Calais, situate vpon the sea coast, built at the mouth of a small riuer, which peraduenture he cal∣leth <HI>Shant:</HI> For in the Arabicke tongue <HI>Wadi-shant,</HI> importeth so much.</P>
<P><SUP>h</SUP> This is false and by himselfe contradicted: for in another place, if I be not deceiued, he maketh it twenty fiue miles ouer: wherefore I doubt not but for a mile the authour did put a parasange, which conteineth three English miles: And this is somewhat neere the mark.</P>
<P><SUP>i</SUP> I take it that he meaneth <HI>Cercester,</HI> in Glocestershire, which vulgarly they now call <HI>Ciceter.</HI> It is an ancient city called of Ptolemey <HI>Corinium,</HI> of Antonine <HI>Durocornouium,</HI> of the Saxons <HI>Cyrenceaster,</HI> taking the denomination from the riuer <HI>Corinus,</HI> or <HI>Churne,</HI> vpon which it is situate. The tract of the decaied wals of it which are two miles about, doe testifie that it was sometime a very great citie. Many antiquities and auncient mo∣numents doe plainly shew that in the time of the Romans it was a place of good rekoning. Now it is nothing so populous and well inhabited.</P>
<P><SUP>k</SUP> From the Seuerne, I vnderstand it, which at euery floude enterteineth the salt water a great way vp into the countrey.</P>
<P><SUP>l</SUP> <HI>Warham,</HI> is a sea towne in Dorsetshire, strongly fortified by nature, vpon the South and North with two riuers, Ware, and Trent (this now they call Piddle) and with the maine sea, vpon the East, only vpon the Wew it lieth open to the assailaunt. Yet it was in times past defended with a faire wall, and a strong Castle. It was very populous, well inhabited, and graced with the Kings mint, for the refining and coining of his mo∣ny, vntill the time of Henry the Second: since whose daies by reason of ciuill warres, casualty by fire, and stopping of the hauen, it is much decaied, and hath lost much of that former beauty.</P>
<P><SUP>m</SUP> This distance is much too great, whether he meaneth the lands end in Cornwall, or the farther part of Wales Westward, which I rather in∣cline to. But obserue this once for all, that there is no great heed to be taken to those his accounts of miles and distances.</P>
<P><SUP>n</SUP> <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> an hauen towne in Deuonshire, situate vpon a little hill running out into the sea, at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Dart</HI> or <HI>Dert,</HI> as some write it. The hauen is defended with two strong Castels or Block-houses. It is very populous, well frequented with Merchants, and hath many goodly tall shippes belonging to it. King Iohn granted them certaine priuiledges and euery yeere to chuse a Maior for their supreme magistrrate and gouernour in ciuill causes vnder the King.</P>
<P><SUP>o</SUP> Thus our seamen cal it at this day: The Arabian termeth it <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Tarfi'lgarbi mina'lgiezira,</HI> The Westerne bound of the iland. Master Camden, in his Scotland, that I may note this by the way, affirmeth that <HI>Taurus,</HI> in Welch, doth signifie the end or limbe of any thing. Heere in Arabicke, thou seest, it signifieth the same. And in English wee call, if I be not deceiued, the brimmes of an hatte, The tarfe.</P>
<P><SUP>p</SUP> SALISBVRY or rather SARISBVRY a sweet and pleasant city, within the County of Wilt, situate in a plaine at the meeting of the riuers Auone and Nadder. It is not that ancient city <HI>Sorbiodunum,</HI> mentioned by Antoninus in his Iournall, but built of the ruines of it, as seemeth very probable. For this old towne being often distressed for want of water, and at length spoiled and rased to the ground, by Swein the Dane, in the yeare of our Lord 1003. (although it reuiued againe a little after, about the time of William the First) was forsaken and abandoned by the citi∣zens, who laid the foundation of this new citie about 400. yeares since, at what time Richard the First was King of England. That most stately Cathedrall Church, which they report hath as many doores as there be months in the yeare; as many windowes as the yeare hath daies; and as many pillars as there are houres in the yeare; was at the same time begunne by Richard, Bishop of Sarum, in a most goodly plot of ground, which vulgarly was called MERIFEILD, and in fourty yeares with infinite cost and charges, it was by him and others finished and brought to that per∣fection which it is at now at this day.</P>
<P><SUP>q</SUP> SOVTH-HANTON (we now call it,) built vpon an arme of the sea betweene two riuers, is enclosed with a double ditch and a faire stone wall. For the better defence of the Hauen Richard the Second caused a very goodly castle to be built all of free stone. It is a passing fine city, ve∣ry populous, rich, and well frequented of Merchants. <HI>Clausentum,</HI> that ancient city mentioned by Antoninus, and stood sometimes in that field which at this day is called Saint Maries, was often spoiled and sacked by the Danes, and at length, in the time of Edward the Third was vtterly consumed and burnt downe to the ground by the French-men: Of whose ruines this New city was built in a place much more better and com∣modious.</P>
<P><SUP>r</SUP> This riuer, peraduenture, was anciently called WENT, and thereof the citie <HI>Wentchester,</HI> happily tooke the name: like as the cite <HI>Colnche∣ster</HI> in Essex, was so called of the riuer Colne, vpon Which it standeth.</P>
<P><SUP>s</SUP> WINCHESTER, A very auncient citie, well knowen to the Romanes, and is oft mentioned in old historians. Afterward in time so the Saxon Heptarchie, the West Saxon Kings ordinarily kept their court heere. Straite after the entrance of the Normans, and peraduenture some∣what before, the Records for the whole land were here bestowed and laied vp. It was once or twise much defaced by casualty of fire, and oft spoi∣led and sacked by vnruly souldiers in time of ciuill warres: but Edward the Third, to salue these damages and hinderances of the citizens and townesmen, placed heere THE STAPLE, or marte for wooll and cloth. At this time it is very populous and well inhabited. The wals of this citie are about a mile and an halfe in compasse. It hath six faire gates, and very large Suburbes adioyning to euery one of them.</P>
<P><SUP>t</SUP> SHORHAM, an ancient Borough and hauen towne in Sussex, first called, as Master Camden writeth, CIMENSHORE of <HI>Cimen,</HI> the bro∣ther of <HI>Cissa,</HI> who together with <HI>Aella</HI> their father, landed a greater multitude of their Saxons. But in continuance of time a greate part of that towne being eaten vp with the sea, and the mouth of the hauen with beech and sand det vp, of a goodly towne it is become a small village, at this day knowen by the name of OLD SHOREHAM, the decay of which gaue occasion of the building and name of another not farre off from it, commonly called NEVV SHOREHAM.</P>
<P><SUP>u</SUP> Heere Athelstane King of the West-Saxons, who made a lawe that no man should be so hardy as to dare to coine money out of great townes priuiledged by the King for that purpuse, erected a Minte for the coyning of his Siluer and other mettals, by which means it became so famous that in the time of the Saxons it deserued the name of a city and was then called by them HASTINGACEASTER. In a plaine, before this towne, that bloody battaill betweene William, the bastard, Duke of Normandy, that cruell tyrant, and Harold the vsurper, sonne of Earle Good∣win, was fought vpon the fourteenth day of October, in the yeare of our Lord 1066. It is one of the cinque ports.</P>
<P><SUP>w</SUP> DOVER, before the entrance of the Saxons was called <HI>Dubris,</HI> as Antoninus in his Iournal testifieth, who nameth it <HI>Portus Dubris,</HI> The ha∣ven Dubris. Vpon that side next the sea that was sometime defended with a strong wall, whereof some part is to be seene at this daie. Victred King of Kent did heere erect a goodly Church, which hee dedicated vnto Saint Martines. The castle which standeth vpon the toppe of an exce∣ding high cliffe, and is thought to be the strongest holde of all England, and therefore called by Matthew Paris <HI>Clauis &amp; repagulum Angliae,</HI> The key and barre of England, was begunne, as is probable, by the Romans; yet not by Iulius Caesar, as they would faine make men beleeue. Vpon another rocke or cliffe, ouer against this on the other side of the towne, there was, as seemeth, a lanterne or watch-tower (<HI>Pharus,</HI> they call it) opposite and answerable to that which the Romans had built at Bollein, beyond the straights in Fraunce, which afterward being decaied was re∣paired by Charles the Great, and at this day is called by the French, <HI>Tour d'order,</HI> by the English, THE OLD MAN OF BVLLEN.</P>
<P><SUP>x</SUP> This is that famous passage <HI>(traiectus,)</HI> from the Continent vnto this Iland, by which Caesar and the Romans alwaies entred and had accesse hither: For vntill the time of Constans and Constantine Emperours of Rome, it was thought almost impossible to come hither from Rome, with a nauy thorough the maine Ocean: And since that long, it was, in time of Christianity, by proclamation forbidden, that, whatsoeuer hee were, borne within the alleageance of England, that had a minde to goe beyond the seas for religion or pilgrimage, it should not be lawfull for him to take shipping any where else but heere. The Frenchmen vulgarly call it <HI>Le pas de Calais,</HI> but the English call it <HI>The streights of Douer.</HI></P>
<P><SUP>y</SUP> <HI>London,</HI> (we now call it) but of the French and Strangers it is commonly called <HI>Londres</HI> or <HI>Londra.</HI> Yet Tacitus, Ptolemey, Antonine, and Ammianus Marcellinus doe with one consent write it LONDINVM or LONGIDINVM, so named of the Britons, as is probable, of <HI>Llong,</HI>
<PB REF="333"/> Ships, and <HI>Dinas,</HI> a Citie: answerable to those places of Graecia <HI>Naupactus, Naupactus, Naustathino,</HI> &amp;c. denominated of Ships. It is doubtlesse a very anci∣ent citie, as Ammianus Marcellinus testifieth, who twelue hundred yeares since called it <HI>Vetustum oppidum,</HI> An ancient towne. Yet Iulius Caesar neuer mentioneth it in all his writings. Cornelius Tacitus, who liued in the daies of Nero, that bloody Emperour, was the first, if I be not decei∣ued, that euer wrot of it, calling it by the name of <HI>Oppidum, copia negotiatorum, &amp; commeatu maxime celebre,</HI> A Towne very famous both for traf∣ficke and great concourse of Marchants, as also for victualls and all manner ot prouision whatsoeuer. Nay he that made the Panegyricke oration to Constantius the Emperour, and Marcellinus who liued after him, giue it no better title. Yet at this day it is An abridgement or breefe view of the whol iland, The Imperiall seate of the Brittish iles, <HI>Regum{que} Angliae camera,</HI> and The chamber of the English Kings: and therefore it may now iustly assume that title of AVGVSTA, The roiall city, which Ammianus so many hundred yeeres since gaue vnto it. And being situate vp∣on the rising of a little hill, in a most wholsome and healthfull aire, in the middest of the richest countries of the land, all a long vpon the North side of the Thames, one of the goodliest riuers of Europe, it is at this day as famous a Marte, for all manner of trade and trafficke as any in the whole world beside. The wals of this citie, which are about three miles in compasse, are not ancient, although some doe write, that at the entrea∣tie of Queene Helena, Constantine the Great caused them to be built. Beside those many and large Suburbes without the wals, there is ioined to it, vpon the West the citie of WESTMINSTER, and vpon the South by a faire stone bridge the BOROVGH OF SOVTHVVARKE, equall for bignesse and multitude of people to many great and good cities: So that London in this respect may iustly be called <HI>Tripolid' Angliterra.</HI> This <HI>Bridge</HI> was begunne first of timber, and afterward in the time of King Iohn it was made all of Free-stone. The foundation of that goodly Mynster or Cathedrall Church of Saint Paul was first laid by Ethelbert King of Kent.</P>
<P><SUP>z</SUP> <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> as we now call it, a very goodly sea towne in the county of Norffolke, situate at the mouth of the riuer Gerne <HI>(Garienis,)</HI> whereof it tooke the name, and was first called <HI>Giernemouth,</HI> and then by corruption in processe of time <HI>Garmouth,</HI> and <HI>Yarmoth.</HI> It is inclosed almost on all sides with water, vpon the West with the riuer aforesaid: vpon the South and East with the maine sea: only vpon the North it lieth open to the firme land, vpon which side it is defended from the assault of the enemy by a very strong wall, which together with the riuer doe make a kinde of Square figure longer one way then an other. On the East side standeth a Block-house, well furnished with great ordinance to defend the ha∣uen and towne from pirates and sea robbers. It hath but one Church, but that is a marueillous faire great one with a very high Spire, seene far off both by sea and land.</P>
<P><SUP>a</SUP> What this towne should be, and where it should stand I cannot say for certaine. The letters in the Arabicke, and the proportion of distance from Yarmouth and Grynsby, doe directly point at Drayton in Northhampton-shire. But because it is too far off from the sea, and was neuer greater then now it is, and for that I finde him so often faulty in those accounts, I doe not beleeue that he meant that place. The name commeth very neere to <HI>Torksey,</HI> which is situate vpon the Trent, and, as Master Camden sath, although now it be but a small towne, yet in times past it hath beene much greater and more famous. For in time of William the First, as appeareth by Doomesday booke, it had two hundred citizens, and enioyed many great and large priuileges.</P>
<P><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>Grimsby,</HI> in Lincolnshire, sometime a very great Marte towne, much resorted vnto from all quarters both by Sea and Land, so long as the ha∣uen lay open ready to entertaine Ships of any reasonable burden. But as the hauen did in continuance of time decay, so the glory of the towne, by little and little vanished, and resigned vp her trade vnto Kingston vpon Hull, her ouerthwarte neighbour, which euer since the time of Rich∣ard the Second, hath greatly flourished, in whose daies of a small village and a very few poore Fisher-mens cottages it began to grow to that great∣nesse, that of a sudden it was not much inferiour to many prety cities.</P>
<P><SUP>c</SUP> <HI>Yorke,</HI> a very goodly citie, situate vpon the riuer Ouse. For beauty, greatnesse, strength, riches and pleasure it is inferiour to none in all Eng∣land, but London only. Old writers call it EBORACVM, the Welchmen <HI>Ebrauc,</HI> or <HI>Effroc:</HI> the Saxons <HI>Eferwic:</HI> And therefore I suspect that this my authour did write it <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Efferwic,</HI> not <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Effradic:</HI> but I alter nothing. It is a very ancient citie oft mentioned in Roman Coines and histories, whereby it is manifest that <HI>Legio sexta victrix,</HI> the sixth conquering legion, did ordinarily reside in this city. The Emperours Seuerus and Constantius, father to Constantine the Great, so long as they abode in this ile, did keepe their court heere, and dying in these parts, were bu∣ried, in this city. This Constantius being a very godly and religious Christian Prince; made it first as our histories report, a Bishops sea, which Ho∣norius Bishop of Rome, afterward aduanced vnto the dignity of a Metropolitane, or Archbishopricke, which, beside the large iurisdiction that it had heere in England, had also vnder it all Scotland.</P>
<P><SUP>d</SUP> <HI>Wiske,</HI> it is called at this day. It riseth in Richmond-shire not farre from Wharleton Castle, as Christopher Saxto maketh me beleeue.</P>
<P><SUP>e</SUP> I finde no mention at all of this place, either in Master Camden, or any other. Onely in the same Saxton vpon the foresaid riuer, some two or three miles aboue Northaluerton, I finde <HI>Danby Wiske:</HI> but whether our authour meant this or not I cannot tell. But I would gladly learne of what place the Lord of <HI>Vescy,</HI> tooke his name.</P>
<P><SUP>f</SUP> <HI>Lincolne,</HI> a large and faire city, situate now vpon the North side of the riuer Witham, called by Ptolemey and Antonine LINDVM, by Beda <HI>Lindecollinum,</HI> by the Normans, as Master Camden testifieth, <HI>Nichol.</HI></P>
<P><SUP>g</SUP> This is very false: For this riuer hauing hitherto, from his fountaine, bent his course Northward as if it meant indeed to vnload it selfe at Grimesby, doth notwithstanding heere alter that determination, and turning it selfe cleane another way at length falleth into the sea at Boston; a place almost full South both from Lincolne and Grimesby.</P>
<P><SUP>h</SUP> <HI>Durham,</HI> situate vpon the top of an hill, by the riuer Weare, which runneth almost round about it, and thereupon was called by the Saxons <HI>Dun-holme,</HI> that is, if we shall interpret it into English, The hill-ile, is no ancient city: For the fiirst stone of it, as our histories report was laid by the Monkes of Lindesferne, in the yeere of our Lord 995. before that we find no mention of it. William the First built the Castle vpon the top of the Hill, which since that time was the Bishops palace.</P>
<P><SUP>i</SUP> <HI>Ireland,</HI> the greatest iland in these Seas, Brittain only excepted: for it runneth out in length from South to North about foure hundred miles: and where it is narrowest it is well neere two hundred miles ouer. But of this we haue spoken in another place.</P>
<P><SUP>k</SUP> <HI>Denmarke,</HI> (we now cal it) is for the most part inuironed and washed with the salt sea: and therefore he doth not greatly erre, in that he termeth it An Iland.</P>
<P><SUP>l</SUP> <HI>Island</HI> (if I be not deceiued) which Solinus in the thirtie fiue chapter of his Polyhistor, saith, is two daies saile from Cathnesse, the North cape of Scotland: His words are these, <HI>A Caledoniae promontorio Thulen petentibus bidui nauigatio est.</HI> Those that doe trauell betweene the cape of Caledonia or Cathnesse and Thule, doe make it two daies saile. Item in the same chapter, a little beneath, he writeth that, <HI>Ab Orcadibus Thulem vs{que} quin{que} dierum &amp; noctium nauigatio est.</HI> From the Orkney iles, to Thule are fiue daies, and fiue nights saile. Yet Island is not that ancient Thule, as Master Camden, in his Britania, proueth at large. The position and distances answer well to Thule, but the quantity or bignesse argueth that he meant Island, which is much farther off either from the coast of Norway, or borders of Scotland, as we shall by and by shew more plainly.</P>
<P><SUP>m</SUP> So it is written apparently: But obserue heere, That of the Arabicke letters, diuerse in forme and shape of body, are the very same, and are onely distinguished one from another by pricks or points, placed either ouer their heads or vnderneath them. Heereupon it is that that Arabicke word which heere I call <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Zanbaga,</HI> (supposing only one letter to be misplaced, which might be the fault of the printer) may indifferently be either <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Norbaga,</HI> or <HI>Norwega,</HI> as the Danes call it: or <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <HI>Neriga,</HI> or <HI>Nerigon,</HI> whereof Pliny speaketh; which is all one in effect. For Pomponius Mela saith that <HI>Thule Bergarum</HI> (thus the learned Clarencieux readeth, not <HI>Belgarum) litori apposita est:</HI> that is, Thule is vpon the coast of Norway, oueragainst the citie Bergen. And it is out of all question, saith the same authour, that by Nerigon Pliny did vnderstand that same country which at this day we call Norway.</P>
<P><SUP>n</SUP> That our authour did meane Island, if there were no other argument, this one were alone sufficient to prooue it. For I doe not remember that any one of the ancient writers euer tooke vpon him to define Thule according to his length and breadth: only Ptolemey and those other au∣thours haue pointed at it, as we haue shewed before, and haue told vs whereabout it lieth in the Sea by the longitude and latitude of it, as also by the situation of it from Scotland, The Orkeney iles, and Bergen in Norway. Whereas he saith that the length of Rosland is 400 miles, it is, I say, apparant that he meant Island. For Ortelius in his Island thus writeth of it: <HI>Patet haec insula in longitudiue centum milliarium Germanicorum, vt vul∣gus scriptorum habet:</HI> The length of this Iland, as the common sort of writers doe testifie, is one hundred Germane miles: Now that a common or ordinary Dutch mile, doth containe foure English or Italian miles, it is a thing so commonly knowen that it needeth no proofe. But hauing hand∣led, Gentle Reader, the particulars, for the most part before in their seuerall places, least I be too tedious in a thing not greatly needfull I cease to trouble thee any longer.</P>

<HEAD>GALIZIA, a kingdome of Spaine.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He kingdome of GALIZIA is bounded vpon the West and North, with the Ocean sea; vpon the East, with the Asturias and the kingdome of Leon: vpon the South, with the riuer Min̄o, and the Kingdome of Portingall. It was sometime, as Ferdinand Oiea, the authour of this Mappe, writeth, much greater then now it is at this daie, and was then held to be one of the lar∣gest kingdomes of all Spaine: For it extended it selfe Eastward vp as farre as the mountaines of Biscaya, and the head of the great riuer Duero, (<HI>Durius</HI> Pliny calleth it) and so from thence it ranne all along by the banke of this riuer euen till where it falleth into the maine sea, as our said authour prooueth, by the testimony of Marius Aretius in his description of Spaine, of Annius Viterbius, and Floriano de Campo in the 40. chapter of his fourth booke; and likewise in the third chapter of his fourth booke. It is very vneuen, and mounteinous, or euery where full of dry barrein hils and dales; and therfore much of it, by reason it wanteth water, is waste and not inhabited. Their Villages and townes, (especially the greater and better sort of them,) are situate vpon the Sea, or vpon some great riuer not farre from thence, except San∣tiago, Lugo, and Mondon̄edo with one or two more. Yet, which is very strange, heere are bred such woonderfull store of horses, that that fable, which reporteth that hereabouts in Spaine the mares conceiue with foale by vertue of the winde, may seeme to be something probable. Yea and this our authour Fernandez Oiea, saith, that it hath great store of cattell, and of all manner of Deere aswell for necessary prouision and mainteinance of the house, as for game and disporte for the nobility and gentry of the land. But of Fish heere taken, not only in the Sea but also in the fresh riuers, there is such va∣riety and woonderfull store that it is from hence conueighed to most places throughout all Spaine. It hath many hot bathes, and other springs and waters of rare and soueraigne vertues. It yeeldeth great plenty of wine, and that so good, especially that which is made about Orense and Riuadauia, that it is transported from hence farre and neere into all coun∣tries Christian. It offordeth much good fruite of all sorts, but especially of Limons and Orenges. Silke and Flax, are ve∣rie great and gainefull commodities vnto the inhabitants. Heere were sometime, as Pliny testifieth, very rich Mines of gold. And Niger writeth that, amongst the Artabri, (who inhabited not farre from Cape finister,) the riuers and brooks did bring downe, after any great store of raine, Earth mingled with Siluer, Tynne and Gold-ore: yea and that the soile heere was so fertile of Gold, Copper and Lead, that ofttimes the husbandmen with their ploughes did turne vp great cloddes of good gold. Yet we know now, saith Maginus, that the Mines of this country at this day are of no great ac∣count. It hath also some quarreis of fine marble. Pedro de Medina reckoneth vp threescore Cities and townes of note in Galizia, of which these following are the most famous and renowmed, and therefore the more worthy the speaking of in this place. COMPOSTELLA, a goodly city situate betweene the two riuers Sar, and Sarela, is now commonly called and knowen by the name of SANTIAGO, <HI>Saint Ieameses,</HI> for that the body of the glorious Apostle Saint Iames, elder brother to Iohn the Euangelist, who first preached the gospel heere and planted Christianity amongst the Spaniards, lieth heere interred: and in honour of this blessed Apostle, by the consent generally of all, Prince, Nobles and Prelates, it was long since adorned with the title and dignity of Metropolitan. This by-word is common amongst the Spaniards, That there be three Apostolicall Churches in the world most renowmed and famous. Saint Peters in Rome, Saint Ieamses in Spaine, and Saint Iohns in Ephesus. They commonly hold, that the first Church that euer was built in Spaine, was that of our Lady in Saragosa, the second was this of Saint Iames. Heere also is a goodly Vniuersity and schoole of good lear∣ning, where all the Liberall Sciences are professed and taught, and many students are brought vp and maintained vntill they come to be of age and abilitie for publike seruice either in the Church or Commonwealth. The GROINE, is a very goodly towne, situate in an isthmos or demy-ile, betweene two baies or creeks of the sea, whereof the one is held to be one of the best hauens of the world: And therefore heere for the most parte of the Kings ships, in time of peace doe lie at anchor. LVGO, one of the principall cities of all Galizia, standeth vpon the Min̄o, not farre from Castro de Rey where this riuer ariseth. It is very ancient, and was out of doubt, knowen to the Romans, at such time they bore the sway in these parts: yet there be some which doe thinke it to haue beene built by the Vandals, long since the decay of that estate. MONDONNEDO is a faire city seated vpon a little riuer toward the Northren sea coast, not farre from Riuadeo. It was aunciently called <HI>Glandomiro.</HI> ORENSE, situate vpon the riuer Min̄o, is a very great and large citie. The wines that are heere made, are counted to be of the best, and equall to those of Riuadauia. Some thinke that it was in old time called <HI>Auria,</HI> yet the Romans, as it is probable, called it <HI>Aquas Calidas,</HI> of the hotte bathes, which heere are founde, and are now of the Spaniards called <HI>Burgas.</HI> TVY, or, as some write it, <HI>Tuyd,</HI> built also vpon the riuer Min̄o, not farre from the maine Sea, was first founded, as they fable by certaine Greeks, who came hither from Troy with Diomedes. Lucius Marineus Siculus maketh BVRGOS to be a city of Galizia. His words are these: Burgos, saith he, is a very famous and ancient city of Galizia in Spaine. It was sometime, as some authours reporte, called <HI>Masburgi, Liconitiurgis, Brauum,</HI> and <HI>Auca,</HI> or as Pliny writeth it, <HI>Ceuca.</HI> It is a very rich and populous citie, much resorted vnto by Gentlemen and Mar∣chants: of the one sorte for pleasure, of the other for profit; and therefore it is euery day greatly enlarged with goodly and sumptuous newe buildings. If thou desire more of this city, I wish thee to repaire to George Braun his Theater of the chiefe cities of the world: If more of this kingdome, read Peter de Medina his <HI>Las Grandezas ycosas notabiles de Espan̄a,</HI> of the strange and memorable things of Spaine; and I make no doubt, if not with truthes and good historicall discourses, yet with tedious tales and fables, thou shalt haue thy belliefull.</P>

<HEAD>FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>RANCE (or GALLIA, as the Latines called it,) at this day one of the goodliest and greatest Kingdomes of Europe, hath notwithstanding in forepassed ages, beene much larger then now it is. For in Iulius Caesars time it conteined all that Westerne part of the Maineland inhabi∣ted and possessed by the <HI>Belgae, Aquitani, Celtae</HI> and <HI>Heluetij,</HI> bounded vpon the North by the Rhein, vpon the West by the maine Ocean sea, vpon the South with the Pyreney mountaines, and vpon the East with the stately Alpes. For thus he writeth in the First booke of his Com∣mentaries of the warres of France: GALLIA <HI>est omnis diuisa in partes tres: Quarum vnam in∣colunt</HI> BELGAE, <HI>aliam</HI> AQVITANI, <HI>tertiam qui ipsorum lingua</HI> CELTAE, <HI>nostra</HI> GALLI, <HI>ap∣pellantur. Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen, à Belgis Matrona, et Sequana diuidit.</HI> All FRANCE is diuided into three parts: whereof the one is possessed of the <HI>Belgae,</HI> the other of the <HI>Aquitani,</HI> the third of those people which they in their language call <HI>Celtae,</HI> wee in ours <HI>Galli.</HI> The <HI>Galli</HI> (or <HI>Gaules</HI>) are diuided from the Aqui∣tanes by the riuer Garonne; and from the <HI>Belgae</HI> by the Marne and Seine. Item a little beneath hee saith that, GALLIA beginneth at the riuer Rhosne, and it is bounded with the Garonne, the Ocean sea, and Belgium; moreouer toward the Sequani and Heluetij it abbutteth vpon the Rhein: It bendeth somewhat Northward. BELGIVM beginneth at the out∣most borders of Gallia; and from thence it costeth along by the inner side of the riuer Rhein: It lieth North and by East from the rest of Gallia. AQVITANIA ariseth at the riuer Garonne, and so from thence it falleth downe to the Pyreney mountaines, and the Spanish seas: It lieth West and by North from the rest of France. Nay beside this diuision, there was yet another much more large, extending the bounds of France beyond the Alpes which did include a good part of Italy, and therefore it was of the Romans named GALLIA CISALPINA, Fraunce on this side the Alpes, or <HI>Italia Gallica,</HI> France in Italy. But of these and the like diuisions we haue in the former spoken plentifully, and therefore we now surcease to repeat them againe in this place. And we are not ignorant how much of this large compasse heere described is at this day seuered from the crowne of France, and hath these many yeeres beene gouerned by seuerall Lords and Princes. A great part of Gallia Belgica, as namely Flaunders, Brabant, Artois, Limburgh and other) belongeth vnto the King of Spaine; Holland, Zeland, with the rest of the Low-countries are gouerned by the States: Zuittzerland, Cleue, Lorrain, Alsas, Sauoy, Piemont, and some other prouinces are held of the Emperour, and are subiect to their proper Princes: and no one foote, for ought I know, of Italy beyond the Alpes doth belong now to the crowne or kingdome of France. The seuerall Shires or Prouinces of this kingdome are very many, whereof the most principall are these, Boulennois, Ponthieu, Caux, Picardy, Normandy, Fraunce, Beausse, Bretaigne, Aniow, Le Maine, Poitow, Lymosin, Santoine, Guien, Gas∣coigne, Perigot, Quercy, Champaine, Berrey, Gastinois, Sologne, Auuergne, Niuernois, Lyomois, Charrolois, Bour∣bonois, Maine, Daulphein, Prouince, Languedocke, Bloys, or Blasois, Forram, Burgundy, La Franche Conte, Verman∣dois and some few others mentioned in this Mappe. The whole land generally is very fertile and withall passing pleasant and healthfull: and thereupon they vse to say that Lombardy is the garden of Italy, and France is the garden of Europe. Yet some places are more fertile for some one commodity then others are. Picardy, Normandy, and Languedocke are as goodly countries for Corne, as any in all Christendome beside. Some places doe afforde great store of fruits, some as great plenty of Wood: In some places Flax and Hempe doe grow in great abundance, in other places they make as great a commoditie of their Woad. The whole countrey generally in all places affordeth much wine, but the best is made in Beausse about Orleans. They haue some mines of Iron, but many of Salt. Whereupon La Noüe saith, that the Corne, Wine, Salt and Woad that is from hence transported into forraine Countries, doth bring in yeerely to the sub∣iects and crowne of France twelue hundred thousand pounds of currant mony. And Iohn Bodine affirmeth that Such springs of Corne, Salt and wine doe heere flow so copiously, that it is almost impossible to empty them or drawe them quit dry. Another, a country man of ours, a worthy gentleman and of as good iudgement, as the best of them, saith that in the prouince of Limosin, are the best Beeues: about Orleans, the best Wines: in Auuergne, the best Swine; and in Berry, the choisest Mutton, and greatest store of Sheepe. In France there are twelue Archbishoprickes: and one hun∣dred and foure Suffraganes, or Bishops. Bodine saith that there are in France twentie seuen thousand and foure hundred Parish Churches, counting onely euery city for a Parish. The cities and walled townes in this country are very many, but of them all PARIS is the chiefe, which doth as much excell the rest, as the lofty cedar doth the lowest shrubbes: And I haue heard say, if my memory faile me not, that the King of France, being demaunded by an Embassadour, how many cities there were in all that his whole country and kingdome, reckoned vp a great number, and amongst them made no mention at all of Paris: and being againe asked the reason why he did not account that for one amongst the rest, answea∣red that Paris was another world. This towne is seated in the Ile of France vpon the riuer Sein, in as pleasant and fertile a place as elsewhere may be found in this whole kingdome. It is a very ancient city, called by Caesar <HI>Lutetia,</HI> by Ptolemey <HI>Lucotecia,</HI> and by Iulianus in his Misopogonus, Leucetia. Zosimus nameth it <HI>Parisium,</HI> and Marcellinus, <HI>Castellum Pari∣siorum,</HI> The castle of the Parisij: For this prouince which now they call properly France, or The Ile of France, was the ancient seat and habitation of the Parisij. The riuer Sein, <HI>(Sequana)</HI> parting it selfe into two streames, diuideth this towne into three parts, to wit, The <HI>Burge</HI> vpon the North side: The <HI>Vniuersity,</HI> vpon the South: and The <HI>Ville,</HI> in the middest, in the ile aforesaid, which seemeth to be the old towne mentioned by Caesar. For thus he writeth in the seuenth booke of his Commentaries of the warres of France: <HI>Id oppidum (Lutetia</HI> hee meaneth) <HI>Parisiorum, positum in insula fluminis Sequanae.</HI> Lutetia that towne of the Parisij, is situate in an iland in the riuer Sein. It is, as our learned country∣man reporteth, tenne English miles about by the wals. The Vniuersity was founded by Charles the Great in the yeere of our Lord eight hundred. For other particulars I wish thee to looke backe to that which we haue written before gene∣rally of France, or particularly of diuers and sundry seuerall Prouinces of the same. And beside those authours before named, thou maiest adioine that our learned countriemam, who not long since set out a discourse of this kingdome inti∣tuled, The view of France.</P>

<HEAD>The Duchie of LIMBORGH, in the Low Countries.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>ERMANIA INFERIOR, or, as we now call it, The Low countries, is at this day diuided into these seuenteene prouinces: to wit, foure <HI>Duchies,</HI> Brabant, Limbourgh, Lukenburgh &amp; Guel∣derland: seuen <HI>Counties,</HI> or <HI>Earldomes,</HI> Flanders, Artois, Heinault, Holland, Zeland, Namur, and Zurphen: one <HI>Marquisate,</HI> commonly called The Marquisate of the Sacred Empire: fiue <HI>Grand Signeories,</HI> Frizeland, Mechlin, Vtreckt, Ouer-issel, and Groninghen. Of the most of these we haue in the former spoken seuerally and at large, onely of Limborgh, which although it be one of the least, yet in honor and dignity not the least, we haue hitherto spoken little or no∣thing. The Dukedome of LIMBOVRGH, therefore, is a very little prouince, situate in the mid∣dest betweene the Duchie of Gulich, Gelderland, the Bishopricke of Leege and Lutzenburge: The citie Limburgh, or as they vulgarly call it <HI>Lympurch,</HI> the chiefe towne of this prouince and whereof it tooke the name, standeth vpon the riuer Wesse, or Wesdo, as they name it, and is distant from Aix three leagues, but from Leige it is foure at the least or somewhat more. It is a very strong towne both by nature and arte: For being built vpon the rising of a stony hill, it is enclosed round with a very defensible wall, garded heere and there with di∣uers strong towers, beside a goodly large Castle all of free stone vpon the toppe of the hill. The situation and prospect of this citie is most pleasant and commendable. For at the foote of the hill, at the townes side, runneth the riuer, vnto which adioineth a goodly fertile plaine where daily great store of cattell are kept and mainteined to the great commodity and gaine of the inhabitants round about. This city is not ancient, nor once mentioned by any old writer, as D. Remacle Fusch, a learned Physician, this countriman borne, plainly confesseth, and yet he saith that hee had diligently searched and turned ouer all authours, who either of set purpose, or by the way, haue handled that kind of argument. The soile is very good and fertile, both for corne and pasture, especially about Heruey, a fine village not farre from Clermont. Onely wine it yeeldeth none at all; but in sted of that, they make of barley steeped and sodden, a kinde of very strong drinke, which will assoone make the tosse-pot drunke, as the strongest wine in France. Lewis Guicciardine writeth that, about halfe a Dutch mile off, from this towne, there is a Mine or quarry of stone, that is very like to mettall: of Pliny, in the 10. Chapter of the foure and thirtieth booke of his Naturall historie it is called <HI>Lapis aerosus, Cadmia,</HI> and <HI>lapis calaminaris</HI> (if I be not deceiued) The brasse stone, or Copper ore. D. Fusch testifieth that it hath also diuerse veines of Lead and Iron. A kinde of blacke stone cole, like vnto that which we heere call Seacoale, of a sulphurous nature, a good fuell and much vsed of Farriers and Smithes, is in diuers places of the country digged out of the ground in great abundance. Moreouer heere are found diuers sorts of stone, not much vnlike to Marble or Iasper party coloured, very beautiful and good for buil∣ding. This countrey at the first was no more but a County or Earldome: vntill that Fredericke, surnamed Barbarosso, in the yeere of our Lord 1172. graced it with the title and dignity of a Duchie. The first Duke that enioied this honor was Henry the First, lineally descended from Henry the Fourth, that valiant and religious Emperour. At length Henry the Second Duke of Limburgh, dying without heire male, Iohn the First Duke of Brabant, about the yeere after Christs in∣carnation 1293, by right of inheritance claimed the same, and by dint of sworde, driuing out Reynold Earle of Gelderland, the Vsurper, obteined it, since whose daies it hath beene quietly possessed by the house of Brabant. Therefore for iustice in ciuill causes, not only Limburg, but also Faulconburg, Dalem and other liberties and free townes beyond the Mose, do come to the courts of Brabant, which ordinarily are held at Brussels: otherwise for ecclesiasticall iurisdiction they doe be∣long to the diocesses of that Bishop of Leige. But beside this dukedome of Limburgh there are diuers other Iursdictions and Signiories described in this Charte; of the which these following are the chiefe, whereof it shal not be amisse to speake a word or two. <HI>Faulconburgh, (Valckembourg</HI> it is called of the Dutch, but of the French, <HI>Fauquemont</HI>) is a very prety towne, which hath iurisdiction and command ouer a large circuite of ground conteining many fine villages. It is three great Dutch miles from Aix, and but two small miles from Mastricht. It was conquered and taken by Iohn the third, Duke of Brabant; who ouercame Ramot the Lord of Faulconburgh, a troublesome man, that at that time laid seege to Mastricht and had much and oft vexed the country round about him. DALEM is a prety fine towne, with a Castle, but of no great strength. It is three long miles from Aix, and two from Liege: It was honoured with the title of an Earldome, and had iurisdiction and command ouer many villages and a great circuit of ground vp as high as the riuer of Mose. Henry the Se∣cond, Duke of Brabant conquered it and adioined it to his dominions. ROIDVCK, or, as Guicciardin calleth it <HI>Rhode∣le-duc,</HI> is an ancient little towne with an old Castle, about one long Dutch mile, as the forenamed authour would haue it, from Faulconburg: yet this our Mappe maketh it about two. AIX or AIX LACHAPELLE, if we may beleeue Mun∣ster, was that which the Latines called <HI>Aquisgranum</HI> so much spoken of and mentioned in the stories of Charles the Great and others of those times. Others would haue it to be that which Ptolemey in the 9 chapter of the second booke of his Geography calleth <HI>Veterra,</HI> and where he saith the thirtieth Legion, called <HI>Vlpia legio</HI> did reside. Limprand nameth it <HI>Pa∣lais de Grau,</HI> Rheginon, <HI>Palais de eaux,</HI> that is, the Water palace; which in my iudgement seemeth most probable; be∣cause I find that that city in Prouence in France which the Romans called <HI>Aquae Sextiae,</HI> the Frenchmen do at this day call <HI>Aix.</HI> This city is situate betweene Brabant, Limburgh, the Duchie of Gulicke, and the Bishopricke of Liege. Some thinke that it was destroied and laid leuell with the ground by Attila king of the Humes: others thinke that it was first founded by Charles the Great. But to leaue all these as doubtfull, this is certeine that it standeth in a most pleasant plaine and as healthfull and sweet an aire, as any may be elswhere found in these parts. That faire Church, of our Sauiour and the blessed Virgin his mother, was built by this Emperour, and by him was endowed with great lands, priuiledges, ma∣ny holy and precious reliques brought thither from sundry places of the world. Beatus Rhenanus writeth that Charles the Great made it the head and chiefe city of the kingdome of France, and generally of all the whole Empire, the ordinary Court and place of residence for the Emperour in these Westerne parts of the same. Moreouer he ordained that heere the Emperour should, by the Bishop of Collen, Metropolitan of this prouince, be crowned with a crown of Iron: at Millan, with a crowne of Siluer; and at Rome with a crowne of Gold. Ouer one of the doores of the Towne-house are written these six Latine verses, <HI>Carolus insignem reddens hanc condidit vrbem, Quam libertauit post Romam: constituendo, Quòd sit trans Alpes hic semper regia sedes: Vt caput vrbs cuncta colat hanc, &amp; Gallia tota. Gaudet Aquisgranum prae cunctis munere clarum, Quae prius imperij leges nunc laureat almi.</HI> And ouer another doore, these two, <HI>Hîc sedes regni trans Al∣pes habeatur, Caput omnium ciuitatum, &amp; prouinciarum Galliae.</HI> This famous Emperour hauing reigned ouer the French∣men 47. yeares and worne the imperiall diadem 14. ended his life in the yeere of our Lord 813. and was heere enterred in a tombe of Marble, in our Ladies Church with this plaine epitaph; <HI>Caroli Magni Christianissimi, Romanorum Imperatoris Corpus hoc conditum est sepulchro.</HI> That is, the body of Charles the Great, Emperour of the Romans, lieth heere inter∣red in this tombe. Thus farre Guicciardine, to whom I wish thee to repaire if thou desire a larger discourse of these par∣ticulars.</P>

<HEAD><HI>AN EPISTLE OF HVMFREY LHOYD, VVRITTEN TO ABRAHAM ORTEL, COSMOGRAPHER TO PHILIP,</HI> the Second, King of <HI>SPAINE,</HI> wherein at large and <HI>learnedly he discourseth of the iland MONA, the</HI> ancient seat of the <HI>DRVIDES.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O satisfie your request concerning the Name and situation of the ile MONA, most learned Ortell, and to set downe in writing what I haue obserued of that argument in the reading of ancient and moderne authours, what I haue found by experience and trauell, and what I haue gathered by the knowledge of the British tongue which to this day is spoken vulgarly by the inhabitants of this iland, were but so much as I confesse is due to your kinde loue and manifold courtesies, whereby you haue many wayes eternally bound me vnto you: Notwithstanding in so doing I am sure to be seuerely censured of many, condemned of some, and generally to be subiect and op∣posed to the obloquy, and scandalous speeches of the baser sort, such I mean as haue no maner of learning or sound iudgement. For a preiudicate opinion, though neuer so false and absurd, nay euen the grossest errors if they be once receiued and setled in the heart, will hardly euer be remoued, especially being patro∣naged and defended by the authority of Polydore Virgil, a graue learned man, and one that for those times was accounted very eloquent. But by their leaue I may say, That this man hath stuffed his Histories with many manifest errours, <HI>mille mendis &amp; mendacijs,</HI> with a thousand faults and falshoods; which he fell into, not only for that he wanted the knowledge of the British tongue, (which now the English, after the maner of the Germans, call Welsh, that is, Strange or Barbarous) without which euen the very name of the iland can by no meanes be truely vnderstood: But also either for that he neuer read the best of our Authours, or els for that he bearing a proud splene and malice against the Britons, (whom the best and most honorable of all the Romane Emperours did loue and greatly esteeme) little weighed their authority, and haughtilie attributing too much to his owne, neglected the better, and followed the steps, poore blinde man, of one William Little, little in name and little in estimation and credit, as blinde a foole as himselfe. But let this brasen faced diminisher of the Britons honour, burst himselfe if he will, and do what he can to the vttermost of his might and malice, so long as Diodorus Siculus, Dion Cassius, twise Consul of Rome, Herodian, Plu∣tarch, Pausanias, Ptolemey and Strabo, are extant amongst the Greekes; Caesars Commentaries, Tacitus his Annals, Eutropius, Suetonius, Orosius, Aelius Spartianus, Iulius Capitolinus, Aelius Lampridius, Flaui∣us Vopiscus, Aurelius Victor, Ammianus Marcellinus, Sextus Rufus, The Panegyricks of Mamertinus and others, Pliny, Antonine, Mela and Solinus, amongst the Latines; beside the Annals of the three Gildases, Ninnius, and diuers other very learned men, written many hundred yeres since in the British tongue, who before the comming of the English, (which our countreymen to this day call by their ancient name, <HI>Sax∣ons</HI>) haue learnedly penned the histories of this their natiue countrey: and beside Asserius, Obbern, Felix Monumetensis, Henricus Huntingtonensis, Malmesburiensis, Annouillanus, Iscanus, Neccham, Gyraldus Parisiensis, Trenetus, and infinite others, which since those Saxons conquered that part of the iland, (which they call England, but we, reteining the old name Lhoëgria,) haue done the like. Let, I say, this proud Italian burst himselfe, and let him snarle at the worthy acts of the Britons, while so many, and such ancient authours do liue to sound the trumpe of their honour, no impudent lying fellow shall euer be able with his calumnies to obscure the bright lusture of the Britons glory, to impeach the honourable fame of their re∣nowmed deeds, spread abroad by such worthy men, or to fasten the least infamy vpon them. But now it is time to come to our proposed argument, and to speake more particularly of MONA, which Polydore Virgil, taking vpon him more than he well might, hath depriued of the ancient name, and leauing it name∣lesse, hath giuen both it and Menauia, to the Ile of Man, as may thus be proued both out of the Greeke, La∣tine, and British writers, as also out of the language which here to this day is spoken by the inhabitants. It is apparent out of Caesar, Tacitus, and others, that MONA was an iland very neere to the coast of Bri∣taine, betweene it and Ireland: In which Sea there are but two (beside the Hebrides) that are of any note and bignesse: Therefore it must needs follow, that one of those two is that MONA which is so often men∣tioned in ancient histories: Wherefore I thinke it not amisse to set downe before your eyes the position of them both, and how they do lie from the coast of England &amp; other ilands round about them, that by that meanes that which followeth may the better be vnderstood. The first of these, which Polydore calleth ANGLESEY, is very neere to that part of Britaine, which we call <HI>Cumry,</HI> and the English, <HI>Wales,</HI> from which it is seuered by a very narrow frith or bay of the sea, (the countrey people call it <HI>Menai</HI>) which ouer∣against the middest of the iland, is hardly a mile ouer. Vpon the East side of this ile there is a very strong castle, and a prety fine citie, called Beaumarish, <HI>(Bellum mariscum)</HI> both built by Edward the First, King of
<PB REF="340"/> England. On the other side of the iland, opposite to this city, there is a maruellous conuenient place to take shipping for Ireland, and therefore it is much for that purpose resorted vnto and frequented by the English. They call it <HI>Holy-head,</HI> but of the Welsh men it is called <HI>Caërgybi,</HI> that is, Gubchester, or, The citie of Kybi. In this iland is <HI>Aberfraw,</HI> which within these three or foure hundred yeeres was the chiefe seat where ordinarily the King of Northwales, (<HI>Gwynedia,</HI> or as some barbarously write it <HI>Venedocia</HI>) did reside and keepe his Court. This iland, for the bignesse of it, mainteineth and breedeth much <HI>cattell</HI> and <HI>sheepe.</HI> It yeerely yeeldeth such plentie of <HI>wheat,</HI> that in respect of that fertility it is commonly called, <HI>The mother of Wales.</HI> They haue little wood here growing: yet euery day the bodies of huge trees, with their roots, and sirre trees of a woonderfull length and bignesse, are heere by the inhabitants found and digged out of the earth in diuers places, in low grounds and champion fields. The people speake the Welsh tongue, and for the most part they do not vnderstand one word of English: notwithstanding they haue for these three hū∣dred yeeres and more beene subiect, as the rest of Wales hath beene, to the Kings and Crowne of England. But now let vs come to the other iland, to which also Polydore Virgil hath not long since without any ground or good authoritie, giuen the name of MONA. That standeth in the middest of the maine sea, distant from the neerest place of England at the least fiue and twentie miles. It is almost as bigge as that o∣ther, but it is farre more barren and waste, and those men that are borne and bred there, are weake and no∣thing so fit for the warres and seruice in the field, only those excepted that are sent thither by the Earle of Darbie, to whom this ile doth by right of inheritance from his ancestours belong. They do speake the Scotish language, or the Irish, as you please to call it, for they be both one. The one is as farre from Ire∣land as the other. These things being taught and conceiued, let vs now heare what the Romans haue writ∣ten of <HI>Mona.</HI> The first authour that euer made mention of it, as I remember, was Caesar; next after him, Pliny and Dion Cassius: But they doe but name it only, and withall affirme it to be situate in the maine sea betweene England and Ireland. Thus much we both confesse. Cornelius Tacitus, a very learned man, and one that by meanes of Iulius Agricola, his father in law, very well knew the state of Britaine then, of the situation and distance of Mona from the Continent, teacheth vs many things making much to this our purpose. Therefore let vs listen awhile to that which he speaketh in the foureteenth booke of his Annals: <HI>But then was Paulinus Suetonius Lieutenant of Britaine, one that for his great experience and knowledge of militarie matters, popular fame, and estimation amongst the meaner sort of men, (which for the most part suffereth no man of rare virtues and qualities to liue without a compere) did alwayes contend with Corbulo, labouring by all meanes possiblie to match that his honou∣rable seruice in conquering Armenia, by ouercomming and quieting those Rebels which in these parts did stand out against the Romans. Therefore he maketh great preparation, and prouideth all things necessarie for the assault and taking of the iland</HI> Mo∣na, <HI>a place not only by nature, but also by reason of the multitude of people which do there inhabit, very strong and defencible, and is indeed the sanctuarie and place of common refuge for all such as runne away from their Capteines or Commanders. He caused boats to be made with flat bottomes, because the sea there neere the shore is verie shallow, and euerie where full of flats and shelfs. Thus they conueyed ouer the footmen, the horsmen followed them partly wading thorow the foords and shallow pla∣ces, and partly swimming where the waters were more deepe. Vpon the shore, to empeach our landing, a very great armie, ve∣rie well appointed and armed for all assaies, stood close thronging together, intermedled with women running to and fro betweene the ranks with torches in their hands, in mourning gownes and their haire about their eares, of all the world like to the Furies or madde women. The Druides also on euerie side with hands lifted vp to heauen, powring out many bitter curses and deadlie im∣precation, with the strangenesse of that sight strooke the souldiers into such a dampe, that they stood stone still, not once moouing their bodies, as if they had willingly offered their throats to the enemie: yet at length by the exhortation and encouragement of the Generall, and one animating and heartening on another, that they might not seeme to be afrayd of a companie of seelie women and other frantike people, they aduance forward the standerd, display their banners, and such as offered to resist, they beat to the ground, and force them to runne into their owne fires. This being done, he placed garrisons in their townes and villages, and caused their woods to be cut downe and vtterlie destroyed; which, by reason of their cruell ceremonies and superstitious sacrifices there offered, were by them esteemed holy. For they accounted it lawfull to embrue their altars wth the blood of their captiues, and to seeke to know the secret counsell of the eternall God and euents to come by the entrailes and bowels of men.</HI> Thou hearest, gentle Reader, how the footmen followed the horsmen in the foords and shallowes, and where the water was more deepe, they swomme ouer with the horses. The same Authour also, setting forth, in the life of Iulius Agricola, the same Agricola's voyage into this iland, writeth on this maner: MONAM <HI>insulam, cuius possessionem reuocatum Paulinum, &amp;c.</HI> Thus translated by the learned Sir Henrie Sauile (for I know not whe∣ther Great Tacitus scorneth any other interpretor or no) <HI>He deliberated to conquer the iland</HI> Mona: <HI>from the pos∣session whereof, as before I haue rehearsed, Paullinus was reuoked by the generall rebellion of Britanie: But as in a purpose not purposed before, ships being wanting, the policie and resolutenesse of the Captaine deuised a passage, commanding the most choise of the Aides, to whom all the shallowes were knowen, and who after the vse of their countrey were able in swimming to gouerne themselues with armour and horses, laying aside their cariage, to put ouer at once, and suddenly to inuade them. VVhich thing so amased the enemie, attending for ships and such prouision by sea, that surely beleeuing nothing could be hard or inuincible to men which came so minded to warre, they humbly intreated for peace, and yeelded the Iland. Thus Agricola at his first entrance into his prouince (which time others consume in vaine ostentation and ambitious seeking of ceremonies) entring withall into labours and dangers, became famous indeed and of great reputation.</HI> Here thou seest againe, how the souldiers gat into Mo∣na by swimming without the helpe of any ships or boats. Neither did this our authour heare this from the
<PB REF="340"/> report of any obscure fellow of little knowledge and lesse vnderstanding in these matters, but euen from the mouth of Agricola himselfe, his wiues father, a man very famous, and one that was the Generall and chiefe commander in this voyage. But marke, I pray you, how Polydore Virgil answereth all this: For thus he writeth in the first booke of his Historie of England. This sometime (he speaketh of Mona) was seuered from Britaine by a very narrow arme of the sea, so that so oft as the sea did ebbe, which heere at all times maketh very high tides, it was so neere to the Continent, that men might go thither without boats. And againe, a little beneath he writeth thus of it: See, sayth he, what continuance of time can bring to passe, That iland is now fiue and twentie miles from any part of England, which sometime was scarse one mile from it. What will not malice, and a crosse humour alwaies opposing it selfe against other mens opinions, although neuer so much turning to his owne disgrace and discredit, yea euen in the best wits, force a man to do! This Italian dreameth of a strange inundation and ouerflowing of the sea, whereof neuer any Hi∣storian, Latine, English, Irish or Scotish euer spake, I dare auouch, one word: and that which is most strange of all, the countrey people neuer haue heard, as seemeth, from their ancestours, of any such kinde of drowning. He complaineth also of the straightnesse of that other iland, and of the scarsitie of Corne and Wood. Where also I could wish that the Authour had had a little more discretion and honestie: For this iland (I meane his Anglisea, which indeed is the true Mona) is about fiue and twentie English miles long, and sixteene miles ouer, euery mile containing one thousand and two hundred Geographicall pases. Therefore it conteineth in compasse well neere threescore and twelue Italian miles: For in some places it is not full sixteene miles ouer. That which he speaketh of the scarsitie of wood here, it is very true: For Ta∣citus reporteth that the woods were cut downe and destroyed by the Romans, an infinite number of the bodies of which, as I haue shewed before, couered with earth and hid within the ground, are at this day by the countrey people found in sundry places of the ile. And that there haue beene woods here within these foure hundred yeeres or thereabouts, it is very manifest by our histories. Of the barrennesse of this Iland I know not well what to say, seeing that he is not ashamed to write that which all men do know to be most false: For such is the fertilitie of this iland, that our people vse to say prouerbially, that Anglesey is the mother of Wales <HI>(Mon mam Gymry.)</HI> Moreouer, the inhabitants (for their proportion, and state of our coun∣trey) are verie wealthie, and withall, stout and valiant, as appeareth out of the English Historiographers: For the English men haue oft times assaulted this iland by sea, and laboured to get the possession thereof, but all in vaine: For they haue been alwaies there slaine, or put to the worst. This, Hugh Earle of Shrews∣burie and Arundell there slaine, can testifie to be true. This also Henrie the naturall sonne of Henrie the First, with many noble men with him there slaine can well testifie. [How true this is I can not tell; but this I finde, that two Hughs of the Norman blood, the one Earle of Chester, the other Earle of Shrewsbu∣rie, did enter this iland, greatly vexe the inhabitants; and that they might the better retaine them in due obedience, did build the castle at Aber Lhienioc: and of these two, Hugh Earle of Chester was indeed there slaine: but how? not in the entrance or assault of the ile, but in the defence of it after he had gotten quiet possession of the same? yet not by the Welsh men, but by the Norweighians, who vnder the conduct of Magnus their Generall landed heere, slew many of the people, robbed the countrey, and departed with great spoile. Of that Henrie I finde not one word in others.] What should I say more? Polydore Virgils Mona distant from the coast of Britaine twentie fiue miles, no whit bigger than this, but much more bar∣ren, and such as breedeth a weaker kinde of men descended from the Irish, euen by the iudgement of Poly∣dore himselfe, doth now renounce the title of Mona. But what other men also do thinke of this matter, let vs heare in few words. Ptolemey the Prince of Geographers, vpon the East side of Ireland placeth foure i∣lands, MONARINA (or as other copies do reade, <HI>Monaida</HI>) MONA, ADROS and LYMNOS. The two latter are very well knowen vnto vs at this day; for that indeed they doe still reteine those auncient names. Adros of our countrey men is called <HI>Ynys ador,</HI> that is, as the words doe signifie, <HI>The iland of birds.</HI> Lymnos they now call <HI>Enlli,</HI> which the English men call <HI>Bardesey,</HI> that is, as he would faine interpret it, <HI>Insula Bardo∣rum,</HI> The Bardes iland. [But I doubt whether our Saxons did euer vnderstand what the Britons <HI>Bardi</HI> meant: yet of this I am sure, that the learned M. Camden in his Britannia is of another opinion.] Of the other two then, the one must of necessity be our Mona, the other Polydores Mona. Monaria is by Ptolemey placed much farther Northward than Mona, and Mona hee maketh to lie somewhat more Easterly than Monaria: For this, Monaria, I meane, or Monaoeda, as Ptolemeyes copies vulgarly haue it, lieth, as he wri∣teth, from the Canaries Eastward 17 degrees and 40 minutes, but vp so high into the North, that the pole there is eleuated aboue the horizont 61 degrees and 30 minutes: when as the other, to wit, Mona, lieth from the Canaries but 15 degrees, and from the North but 57 degrees and 40 minutes. Polydores Mona leaneth both more toward the North and East than ours doth: Therefore it is Ptolemeys Monaria that he speaketh of, not Ptolemeys Mona. And this our Mona shall still reteine that ancient name of Mona, which Ptolemey gaue vnto it in his time. This we haue collected out of forreine histories: Now let vs come to our owne Writers, who I thinke, in a matter of names of places in their owne country and language ought rather to be beleeued than an Italian, a meere stranger borne and brought vp beyond the seas, farre from this our countrey. But that these things may the better be vnderstood, some few lines are here by the way to be inserted. All men do know and confesse this to be true, that the Britons, before the entrance of the
<PB REF="341"/> English or Saxons did possesse this whole iland: vntill such time as being by them conquered and subdued, they were forced to abandon the better part of the same, leauing it to the possession of their enemies; and to content themselues with the Western parts only: And they being thus seated, were called by the names of the places were they dwelt, as for example those which possessed Cambria, were named <HI>Cambri:</HI> those which inhabited <HI>Cornouia,</HI> were knowen and called by the name of the <HI>Cornouij.</HI> Yet the English men did, after the maner of the Dutch (who name the French and Italians, <HI>VVelsh</HI>) call them all generally <HI>VVelshmen:</HI> Adding for difference sake the names of the countries, as it is manifest by those histories, which yet are ex∣tant, written in the Saxon tongue. For those our <HI>Brits,</HI> are in them called <HI>VValae:</HI> and the Cornouij, <HI>Corn∣walae;</HI> not, as the vnlearned do thinke, <HI>Cornugalliae.</HI> Neither can I with silence ouerpasse that shamelesse im∣pudencie of Polydore, who braggeth that he was the first that euer found this out, and committed the same to writing; when it is most certeine that he stole this etymologie and reason why this our countrie was cal∣led Wales, out of Syluester Giraldus. But, that I may returne vnto that where I left, the Welshmen being thus cooped vp into a corner, did notwithstanding reteine the ancient British tongue: so that the Coun∣tries, Cities, Riuers, Ilands, and people of Britaine, are by the Welshmen called by those names whereby they were knowen and called at such time as they possessed the whole. For our countrey people, such I meane as are borne and brought vp farre within the land, do not know what the name of an English man doth meane, but all the English they do generally terme <HI>Saisson,</HI> that is, Saxons, (for they haue no <HI>x</HI>) Eng∣land they call by the ancient name <HI>Lhoëger:</HI> Wales, <HI>Cambri:</HI> Cornwall, <HI>Corniw:</HI> Scotland, <HI>Alban:</HI> Ireland, <HI>Yuerdhon:</HI> and indeed some old Writers do write the name of this iland not <HI>Hibernia,</HI> but <HI>Iuernia,</HI> as M. Cam∣den sheweth at large in his Britannia. So also we doe still call all the Cities of England by those names whereby they were sometime called before the entrance of the Saxons. But let vs come againe to Mona. Our countreymen and the inhabitants of this ile (speaking now at this day the ancient British tongue) doe know no other name of it than MON, for so they all generally call it. Polydore Virgil calleth it ANGLE∣SEA, that is, The English ile. I grant that this iland being subdued by the English men, was beautified and graced with their name, and that the English men do so call it I do not denie. But, I pray thee, did the Eng∣lish men first descrie this iland, was it neuer seene before, or had it no name at all before their comming? Hearest thou Polydore, bethinke thy selfe; thou mayest aswell say that England is not that land which was sometime called Britannia, nor that was not Gallia, which now we call France. Nay, which is a greater mat∣ter than this, and more strange, the inhabitants of this ile (notwithstanding they be subiect to the crowne of England) do neither know what England or an English man doth meane: For an English man they call <HI>Sais,</HI> (but in the plurall number speaking of more than one, <HI>Saisson</HI>) and this their natiue countrey they name <HI>Mon.</HI> Moreouer, that faire citie built vpon that arme of the sea or frith, aboue mentioned, on the o∣ther side ouer against the West part of this iland, is called <HI>Caeraruon,</HI> that is, The citie vpon Mon: For Caer, in our language signifieth a walled towne; (<HI>Kir,</HI> in Hebrew is a wall, and <HI>Kartha,</HI> in those Easterne tongues is a walled citie:) <HI>Ar,</HI> is as much to say, as Vpon: and as for the <HI>v,</HI> in the last syllable, for <HI>m,</HI> that is the pro∣prietie of the language in some cases: for in all words beginning with <HI>m,</HI> in consequence of speech, that let∣ter, after some certeine consonants is changed into <HI>v,</HI> for which our nation doth alwayes vse <HI>f:</HI> because that <HI>v,</HI> with them is euermore a vowell: So we call Wednesday <HI>(Diem Mercurij) Die Mercher,</HI> but Wednesday night <HI>Nos Fercher.</HI> Mary, we call <HI>Mair;</HI> but for our Ladies church we write and pronounce <HI>Lhanuair.</HI> Nei∣ther is this citie only thus named, but euen that whole tract of the continent of Britaine that runneth along by it is called <HI>Aruon,</HI> that is, Opposite or ouer against Mon. But let it be, that this iland was not that Mona so oft mentioned by the ancients, then ought Polydore for his credits sake haue found another name for it, and not to haue left it wholly namelesse. Now let vs come vnto the other, which our countreymen do call MENAW: and which all the inhabitants generall, as also the English and Scots (reteining the Welsh name, but cutting it somewhat shorter) MAN. Therefore there is no man, for ought I know, beside this proud Italian, and one Hector Boëthius, a loud liar, that euer called this iland by the name of Mona. But leauing these demonstrable arguments, which indeed do make this matter more cleere than the noone day, let vs come vnto authorities and testimonies of learned men, which in some cases are rather beleeued than any o∣ther arguments whatsoeuer: by these I doubt not but the true and proper name shall be giuen to ech of these ilands, and the controuersie decided without any maner of contradiction. There is a piece of Gildas Britannus, that ancient writer, a man euery kinde of way learned, at this day remaining, in the Librarie of the illustrious Earle of Arundell, the only learned Noble man of his time; in which he hath these wordes: England hath three ilands belonging to it: Wight, ouer against the Armoricanes, or Bretaigne in France: The second lieth in the middest of the sea betweene Ireland and England. The Latine Historians doe call it <HI>Eubonia,</HI> but vulgarly in our mother tongue we call it MANAW. Thou hearest, gentle Reader, a natu∣rall Welsh man speaking in the Welsh tongue: For thus we call Polydore Virgils Mona in our natiue lan∣guage euen at this day. Moreouer, the reuerend Beda, that worthy Englishman, famous thorow all Chri∣stendome in his dayes for all maner of literature and good learning, in the ninth chapter of the second booke of his Historie writeth thus: At which time also the people of Northumberland <HI>(Nordan Humbri)</HI> that is, all that nation of the Angles which did inhabit vpon the North side of the riuer Humber, with Ed∣win their king, by the preaching of Paulinus (of whom we haue spoken a little before) was conuerted vnto
<PB REF="341"/> the faith of Christ. This king in taking of good successe for his enterteinment of the Gospel, did grow so mightie in Christianitie and the kingdome of heauen, and also had that command vpon the earth, that he ruled (which neuer any king of the English did before him) from one end of Britaine to the other, and was king not only of the English but also of all the shires and prouinces of the Britons. Yea and he brought vn∣der his subiection, as I haue shewed before, the iles of Man <HI>(insulae Menaniae.)</HI> Here I do thinke, that for <HI>Me∣nauiae,</HI> it ought to be written <HI>Menauiae:</HI> seeing that there is such small difference betweene an <HI>n</HI> and a <HI>u,</HI> that they may easily be mistaken, and one put for another. Moreouer, Henry Archdeacon of Huntingdon, a worthy Historiographer, who wrote about the yeere of our Lord 1140, one that followed Beda in many things almost foot for foot, doth seeme also to correct this fault, and cleere the doubt. For he setting forth the great command and conquests of this Edwine King of the Northumbers, brusteth out into these words: Eduwyn the king of the Northumbers ruled ouer all Britaine, not only ouer that part which was inhabited of the English, but ouer that also which was possessed of the Britons, Kent only excepted. More∣ouer, he brought the ile <HI>Menauia,</HI> which lieth between Ireland and Britaine, and is commonly called MAN, vnder the obedience of the Kings of England. Here obserue, that this English man did giue also to this i∣land (which Polydore Virgil falsly calleth Mona) the English name: for it is commonly, sayth he, called <HI>Man:</HI> by which name it is knowen &amp; called at this day of all the English. Besides this also Ranulph of Che∣ster in the foure and fortieth chapter of the first booke of his Polychronicon, doth thus speake of those i∣lands which are neere neighbours vnto Britaine: Britaine, sayth he, hath three ilands lying not farre off from it (beside the Orkney iles) which doe seeme to answer vnto the three principall parts of the same: For WIGHT lieth hard vpon the coast of <HI>Loëgria,</HI> which now is called England <HI>(Anglia:)</HI> MONA which the English call Anglisea, perteineth vnto <HI>Cambria,</HI> that is, to Wales: But the ile EVBONIA, which hath two other names, <HI>Menauia</HI> and <HI>Mania,</HI> lieth oueragainst Scotland. These three, Wight, Man, and Anglisea <HI>(Vecta, Mania, Mona)</HI> are almost all of one bignesse, and conteining the like quantitie of ground. Thus farre Ranulph of Chester. The reason why Gildas and others haue called this iland <HI>Eubonia,</HI> I take to be this; because it was first inhabited of the same nation (to wit, the Irish) of the which the <HI>Euboniae,</HI> the West iles, commonly of the Historians called <HI>Hebrides,</HI> are. The reuerend Beda and Henry Huntington, in that they write it <HI>Menauia,</HI> do seeme to allude to the Welsh name <HI>Manaw:</HI> but this is it which we would haue thee di∣ligently to obserue, that none of them do call it Mona. By these arguments and testimonies it is manifest that <HI>Mona</HI> is that iland which the inhabitants (as I haue shewed before) doe at this day name <HI>Mona,</HI> or Mon, acknowledging no other name, and is that which of the English is called Anglisea: but the other, which Polydore Virgil, and such as doe loue with him to wallow in the mire, rather than to seeke for the cleere streames, doe call Mona, is of Gildas called <HI>Eubonia,</HI> of Henry Huntington <HI>Menauia,</HI> and of others <HI>Mania.</HI> Here I will conclude this discourse with this one testimonie, which may indeed woorthily stand for many; to wit, this of Syluester Girald a Welsh man borne, a man no lesse famous for his learning, than for his no∣ble birth: For he was descended from that noble house of the Giralds, to whom the Kings of England are beholding for that footing which they haue in Ireland. Moreouer, he was greatly beloued of Henrie the second King of England, and was afterward Secretarie to King Iohn his sonne; whose name also is very fa∣mous and oft mentioned in the Popes Decretals: For being but bishop of S. Dauids in Wales, he did not∣withstanding contend with the Archbishop of Canturburie about the prerogatiue &amp; primacy: This man, I say, in that his booke which he intituled <HI>Itinerarium Balwini Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis, crucem in infideles per Cam∣briam praedicantis,</HI> The Iournall or trauels of Baldwin Archbishop of Canturbury, when as he preached the Gospell and crosse of Christ against the Infidels thorowout all Wales (whose company he neuer forsooke in all that peregrination) writeth thus of the ile MONA. On the morrow we passed by the castle of Caer∣aruon, and from thence thorow the valleys and steepe hilles and mountaines we came vnto Bangor, where we were most kindly enterteined of the bishop (whose name was Gwian, who was almost constrained to take vp the crosse of Christ) with a great lamentation and shout of all sorts of people both men and wo∣men. From thence, crossing a vety narrow arme of the sea, we passed ouer to MONA, an iland lying a∣bout two miles off from the maine land. Here Rothericke the yonger sonne of Owen came very deuout∣ly with all the people of that ile and of the countreys round about him, to meet vs. There they making as it were a theater of the craggie rocks, by the preaching of the Archbishop, and of Alexander the Archdea∣con of that place, many were wonne vnto the crosse and to beleeue in Iesus Christ, but certeine yong men, lustie-bloods, of the seruants and followers of Rothericke, which sate oueragainst vs, would by no meanes be drawen to beare the crosse. Of these some, within a little while after, following certeine theeues or free-booters, being slaine outright, others hurt and dangerously wounded, did of their owne heads lay a world∣ly crosse one vpon anothers backe. Rothericke was married to Prince Reese's daughter, who was allied to him in the third degree: her, by no admonitions, he could be made to put away from him, hoping that by her meanes he should the better be able to defend himselfe against his brothers children, whom he had disherited and put by their lands and possessions: notwithstanding it fell out contrary to his expectation, for within awhile after they recouered all againe out of his hands. This Iland hath three hundred three and fortie villages or farmes, yet it is esteemed but at three Cantreds. Britaine hath three ilands lying not farre off from it, all almost of like quantitie and bignesse: <HI>VVight,</HI> vpon the South; <HI>Mon,</HI> vpon the West;
<PB REF="342"/> and <HI>Man,</HI> vpon the Northwest. The two former are very neere to the continent, the armes of the sea by which they are seuered from England, being but very narrow and not farre ouer. The third which is called Man, lieth mid way betweene Vlster, a prouince of Ireland, and Gallawey of Scotland. Mona, or Mon, of the inhabitants, by reason of the great plenty of wheat which it yeeldeth ordinarily euery yeere, is called The mother of Wales. And a little beneath, the same Authour writeth thus of this iland: Hugh Earle of Shrewsbury and Arundell, with Hugh Earle of Chester, entring this iland by force, did shut dogs all night in the church of Fefridanke, which the next morning were found all starke madde; and he himselfe after∣ward by the inhabitants of the Orkeney iles, comming thither as pirats and sea-robbers, vnder the leading of Magnus their captaine, being shot in the eye (which part of his body only was vnarmed and subiect to the enemies weapon) fell stone dead from the decke of the shippe into the sea: which Magnus beholding, cried out in the Danish language, <HI>Leit loope,</HI> that is as much to say in English, Let him leape. Moreouer, Henry the Second, going into North-Wales with an armie of men, ioyned battell with the aduersarie at Caleshull in a narrow straight betweene two woods, and withall sent a saile of ships into Mona, which spoi∣led the foresayd Church with other places there: wherfore they were almost all slaine, taken, dangerously wounded, or put to flight by the inhabitants of that ile. There were in this company two noble men, and his vncle which wrote this story, with other mo sent hither by the King, to wit, Henry the sonne of Henry the First, and the vncle of Henry the Second, begotten of the honourable lady Nesta, daughter of Reese, Theodore's sonne, borne in the confines of South-Wales, I meane in the skirts of it next vnto Deme∣tia or West-Wales, and the brother of Steuen, brother to Henry by the mothers side, but not by the fa∣thers, a man that first in our dayes, breaking the way for others, not long after this, attempted the entrance and conquest of Ireland, whose worthy commendations the prophicall history doth at large set foorth. Henry being too venturous, and not being seconded in time, was killed at the first encounter with a pike. But Robert distrusting his owne strength and doubting whether he should be aided or not, fled, and being sore wounded, very hardly recouered the shippes. This iland outwardly appeareth as if it were barren, rough, and ouergrowen, like as the countrey of Pebidion neere Menauia doth, although indeed it be very fertile of many things in diuers places. Thus farre Gyraldus. What could euer be spoken or written more plainly and euidently of the name, situation, fertility and valourous inhabitants of Mona; as also of the si∣tuation and name of that other iland? The same authour in his description of Wales, thus speaketh of this Iland: In North-Wales betweene Mona and Snowdon hilles is Bangor the bishops sea. As of all Wales, the South part about Cardigan shire, (<HI>Cereticam regionem,</HI> he calleth it) but especially euery where in West-Wales, <HI>(Demetia)</HI> by reason of the champion plaines, and commodiousnesse of the marine coasts, are farre the more pleasant and better: so North-Wales <HI>(Borealis Venedotia)</HI> is knowen to haue many countries and places farre more strong and better fortified by nature and situation, many more goodly braue men, euerie where to haue much better and more fertile ground: For like as Snowdon hilles are thought to be able to finde pasture for all the cattell in Wales if they were all driuen thither, so it is reported that the ile Mona <HI>(Anglisea)</HI> may for a time finde all Wales bread-corne; such is the woonderfull store of wheat that it doth yeerely yeeld. What man is he that is so blockish and void of vnderstanding, that shall read and consider these arguments and allegations, that will make any doubt whether Polydore's Anglisea be the true Mona, that ancient seat of the Druides, so renowmed by the Romane warres, and oft mentioned in their histories? Moreouer, who can doubt, whether that other Iland, which the Welshmen call <HI>Manaw,</HI> and the English <HI>Man,</HI> which he and some other learned men (chusing rather to drinke puddle water from a neere channell, than to seeke farther for a cleere streame or pure fountaine) haue falsly named <HI>Mona,</HI> or whether we ought not rather with Ptolemey to call it <HI>Monaria,</HI> or <HI>Monaida; Eubonia,</HI> with Gildas; <HI>Menauia,</HI> with Beda and Henrie Huntington; or <HI>Mania,</HI> with Gyraldus?</P>
<P>Many more arguments and testimonies of learned men I could in this place haue alleaged: but lest I should be too tedious and troublesome to the Reader, I will at this time with these content my selfe: no∣thing doubting but these, to any learned man, or any one well acquainted with the Welsh histories, shalbe thought sufficient to stop the mouth of the scandalous aduersary, and to answer all the cauils of the maliti∣ous enuiours of the Britons glory. Therefore I must entreat thee, most learned Ortell, for that thy kind∣nesse and humanity which thou art wont to shew to others, to take this in good part, and in that thy good∣ly Theater, to set out this our Mona, in the ancient colours, to the publicke view of the world: And I hope before it be long to send you a more absolute description, not only of this our Mona, but also of all Wales, illustrated both with the ancient names vsed by the Romans and Britons, and also with the moderne Eng∣lish, whereby they are knowen at this day of that nation. Moreouer, I haue a Geographicall Chart or Map of England, described according to the moderne situation and view, with the ancient names of riuers, townes, people and places, mentioned by Ptolemey, Pliny, Antonine and others, that those grosse and shamelesse lies of Hector Boothe may by that means the easilier be descried: against which Hector Boothe our Leland, that famous and learned Antiquary wrote this most worthy Epigramme: <HI>Hectoris historici tot, quot mendacia scripsit, Si vis vt numerem, Lector amice, tibi; Me iubeas etiam fluctus numerare marinos, Et liquidi stellas connumerare poli. Would'st haue me, gentle Reader, tell I he lies that Hector Boothe did write? I may aswell count sand of sea, Or starres of heauen in cleerest night.</HI> I haue also a very exact description of the marine tract or sea coast of Scot∣land:
<PB REF="342"/> all which when I shall come vp to London (which God willing shall be before the end of April next) I will send vnto you: Whereby the manifest and palpable errours of certeine learned men shall be discoue∣red: who in their Geographicall Chart, trusting too confidently to certeine vnlearned mens relations and writings haue most falsly and erroneously set downe the names of diuers places, cities and riuers, to the great preiudice and danger of such as shall giue heed vnto them. In the meane time I bid you heartily farewell, beseeching you, of all loues, if there be any thing wherein I may pleasure you, not to entreat it, but to command it, by the law of friendship and league of lear∣ned scholars. Richard Clough, a verie honest man, and one that was the cause and procurer of this our loue and acquaintance, aswell your friend as mine, shall both bring your letters from you to me, and mine to you, that interest I know we both haue in him. Againe farewell, most kinde ORTELL: from <HI>Denbigh</HI> in <HI>Guynedh</HI> or North-Wales this fifth of April, in the yeere of our Lord God M.D.LXVIII.</P>
