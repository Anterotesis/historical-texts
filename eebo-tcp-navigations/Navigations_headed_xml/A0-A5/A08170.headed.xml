<HEAD>From Constantinople.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hereas you haue a long time expected some relation of newes, and discourses con∣cerning the affaires of Europe; alas, you must consider what you doe, when you come into a well furnished Garden, you see the frost and the snow hath nipped the flowers, and there is scarce any ap∣pearance either of sweet herbes or flourishing plants: only the roots remaine safe in the ground, and peraduenture at the spring through the warmth of the Sunne, and the nature of the soile assume as it were new life, and shew forth some beautifull hansomnesse, so hath the winter delt with the affaires of Europe, the Souldiers haue beene glad of refreshing, and the Princes taken care to make them strong with ease and quietnesse, but now the Spring comming for∣ward, and the storme of cold ouer-blowne, you shall see peraduenture the roots to receiue a strange freshnesse, and new businesse, shew you a face both of terrour and pleasure: till when I will be bold to vnseale certaine Letters which shall tell you of certaine well manured grounds, which euen this winter haue brought forth
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>some flowers, and simple although they proue <HI>Antipathies</HI> in nature to some constitutions: the Letters then from <HI>Constantinople</HI> assure vs thus much, that whereas <HI>Daout Bashaw,</HI> the setter vp of <HI>Mustapha,</HI> after the strangling of <HI>Osman,</HI> who had married one of the daughters of the Empresse, proiected not onely the gouerne∣ment of the Empire, but the ouerruling of the Emperour: yea peraduenture the aduancing of his posterity to the throne of <HI>Othoman,</HI> by foi∣sting in a sonne of his own, and then to strangle the yong brothers of <HI>Osman,</HI> and so to follow with the death of <HI>Mustapha.</HI> The new Viceer, called <HI>Huzein Bashaw,</HI> comming from <HI>Gran Cairo,</HI> as a giuer of Antidotes to the poison of these turmoiles, had no better meanes to ad∣nance the frame of his greatnesse, then to call <HI>Daout Bashaw</HI> &amp; the Empresse in question for so perfidious a plot, and dangerous a treason: The woman either transformed her selfe, and so was obscured: or corrupted the Officers of State, &amp; so was remitted; or confessed all to the princi∣pall Mufty, and so was pardoned. But the Ba∣shaw, the Ianisaries not enduring his Apology, was presently cut in pieces: so that <HI>Mustapha</HI> after many changes is now in the hands of <HI>Hu∣zein Bashaw,</HI> who taking example by the for∣mer affrightings, hideth as yet his panther ta∣ients of policy concerning the augmentation of his owne honour, and falleth directly to the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>setting vpright the staggering Common-wealth, and adding as it were a tincture to the beauty of the Othoman glory, wherein he hath proceeded in such a manner, and with so rare a discipline, that when hee sacrificed as it were 200. Ianisaries, who had beene delinquents in the murther to the ghost of <HI>Osman,</HI> all the rest endured the punishment and gaue a plaudit to his loyalty. <HI>Mustapha</HI> in the meane time sits like a shadow, and is glad of the peace which <HI>Huzein Bashaws</HI> gouernment hath established, louing him because he hath effected the obser∣uation of the Souldiers toward him, and fearing himselfe because he hath already seene what the malignity of time hath done, and the insolent Souldier is ready to put in practice.</P>
<P>For euen the other day when the people were distasted with <HI>Mustaphus</HI> pusillanimity, and re∣membred the heroicke sprightfulnesse of mur∣thered <HI>Osman,</HI> when they heard of the tumults of <HI>Asia,</HI> and the suspicious reuolts of the Ba∣shawes of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Babylon,</HI> when some had whispered in their eares, O what a difference is there betweene the magnanimous countenance and maiesticall presence of <HI>Osman,</HI> and the de∣iected aspect of <HI>Mustapha,</HI> who men would iudge to be fitter for a Monastry then a Palace; or to pray in a Cel rather then rule in a Throne: they suddenly called for the sight of <HI>Osmans</HI> brethren, who very politikely without any delay
<PB N="4" REF="4"/><HI>Huzein Bashaw</HI> brought out of the <HI>Serali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and aduanced in the <HI>Hippodrame,</HI> assuring the souldiers, that neither it was <HI>Mustaphaes</HI> pleasure, nor any motiues of Superiours, ei∣ther to obscure them or disappoint them: onely there was reason by no meanes to dis∣locate <HI>Mustapha</HI> now raigning, considering their young yeeres, and the suspitious trou∣bles of the confining Princes. For if any new tumults should arise out of the aduan∣tages of disorder, God knowes what the Persian might doe in Asia and Arabia, and the Emperour and King of Poland in Hun∣gary and <HI>Transiluania,</HI> considering they had al∣ready thriued against their enemies on euery side: therefore he commanded them to qui∣etnesse and silence, and demand of him an account of the Princes, when occasion should serue. In this manner was his wisdome so sea∣sonable, that the flames of this new sedition were delicately quenched: the Princes retur∣ned to the pallace: <HI>Mustapha</HI> established in the Throne, himselfe preuailed with their good opinion, and the whole body of the <HI>Ianizaries</HI> recouered from the growing infection of re∣uolts and disorder, so that the city was sud∣denly quieted, and all good gouernement obserued.</P>
<P>Much about this time, which was in Octo∣ber last, some will haue the <HI>Persian</HI> Embassa∣dor
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>to ariue; as well to gratefie the new enthro∣nized <HI>Mustapha,</HI> as to renew the old and cu∣stomary treaties of peace: some againe say there was no new Embassador, but that the Ligier there, had seuerall directions from <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> both to present the Emperor certaine gifts, and to gratefie the <HI>Viceer</HI> for his indulgent care ouer the Common-wealth, in so dange∣rous and suspitious times of innouation. And also to associate himselfe with the English Em∣bassador, and present him with a Target of gold, and other gifts in behalfe of the <HI>Sophy</HI> his Lord, and by reason of the seruices, the English had done him at <HI>Ormus,</HI> who there∣upon tooke a conuenient time, and by way of Visitation came vnto him, vsing these or the like speeches.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I am commissioned from my great Master,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Persian Ambassador to the English Ambassador.</NOTE> the <HI>Sophy</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> not onely to visit you, but gratefie you with such presents as befitteth him to bestow, and you to receiue: the motiues arising from the high deseruings of your nation, and the noble renoune of your Prince: For if Marchants or if you please Marchants Factors, can merit so well of fame, as to equall great Commanders in heroick acti∣ons, what doe the Nobles and Gentiles deserue, who questionlesse giue good example to the rest, and cannot but reioyce the kings heart to
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>haue such subiects, and worthy souldiers: but to the purpose. The trafficke of silke being long since setled at <HI>Ormus,</HI> the Portingalls pos∣sessing certaine places about <HI>Iasques,</HI> on the Easterne side of the Persian Gulph, and chal∣lenged by the great <HI>Mogull</HI> of the hither <HI>India,</HI> not only debarred all commers as men say, but by extraordinary meanes, and force surprised the Castle, and Iland of <HI>Ormus:</HI> which when my great Lord vnderstood after mature con∣fideration, as vnwilling to endure the indigni∣ty, besides the losse of his prerogatiues and customes, hee capitulated with the English, and vpon certaine conditions by way of salary entertainement, admitted them to his seruice, and committed the managing of the affaires to their endeuours; so an army was prepared, but because the Castle could not be obtained, nor the Iland cleered without great Ordnance, and that the English ships lay so conueniently in the Gulph, hee likewise hired their Ord∣nance, and after many skirmishes, time and their owne valour, mounted two hundred peeces, and banded three hundred men, who demea∣ned themselues so valiantly, and bestowed their shot so effectually, that by degrees wee were Lords of the Iland, and absolute Masters of the towne; the <HI>Portingals</HI> not able to endure the encounters, nor braue assaults without losse and some slaughters.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<P>Thus by degrees they won the Iland, and ex∣pulsed the <HI>Portugals</HI> out of the Towne, nothing remaining but the fortified Castle, which was de∣tained but a while; for the defendants foreseeing an vtter destruction by holding out, considering our <HI>Persians</HI> were euery where so malitious and violent against them, gained the sauing of their liues by orderly composition, and so quite aban∣doned the place, and we were quickly masters of all; which without flattery or other insinuation, it pleaseth my great Master to attribute to the wis∣dome and vnmatchable valour of the <HI>English,</HI> and for which he hath recompenced euery man accor∣ding to his deseruing, and is contented that the trafficke for Silke shal remaine free to the <HI>English,</HI> and halfe the customes of the Towne and Iland of <HI>Ormus</HI> be as it were a yeerely compensation to the <HI>East India</HI> Company at your City of <HI>London.</HI> And thus much for <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>

<P>You haue often heard how the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Cossacks</HI> of <HI>Bogdonia</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> liue for the most part vpon spoile and robberies of Merchants, ex∣cept the wars imploy them, or they imploy them∣selues to the seruices of other Princes, which cu∣stome it seemes they still retain: for euen the other day as bad men (though enemies) soone agree to commit outrages, &amp; any villanie to enrich them∣selues: so did they combine to forrage into <HI>Russia,</HI> and went so farre, and preuailed so well, that if an embucy from <HI>Mosio</HI> had not acquainted King <HI>Si∣gismond</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>with the mischiefe and forcible attempts they had questionlesse kindled a fire which a great deale of water could not haue quenched: but thus disappointed at that time, and vnderstanding of a truce and limited peace betweene the King of <HI>Po∣land</HI> and King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and that also the Empe∣rour of <HI>Germany,</HI> though there were great prepa∣rations for warre, was vnwilling to entertaine them, or to indure their vnrulinesse either in <HI>Hun∣gary</HI> or <HI>Bohemia,</HI> they went another way to worke, and concluded with the <HI>Tartars</HI> to lay a Plot vp∣on the City of <HI>Leopolis,</HI> which being discouered by certaine poore Pedlars men and women of the same trade the Inhabitants preuented. For vn∣derstanding of their abode and places of associati∣on, they made a braue sally, and by the assistance of the Villages, not onely dissipated their meetings and disappointed their pretended villany, but put diuers of them to the sword, and by many fearfull slaughters compelled them out of those Confines, so that they were enforced to hide themselues in the woods, and flie to the borders of the blacke Sea.</P>

<HEAD>From Transiluania.</HEAD>
<P>AS after great windes and fearefull tempests, though the ayre is calme, and they seeme ap∣peased, the Sea yet remaines turbulent, and the billowes mount a great while: so fared it with the
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>businesse and affayres of <HI>Turky,</HI> though the Citie was quieted, and the <HI>Ianizaries</HI> seemed appeased, yet euery man was almost affrighted, and the whis∣pering Troops amased the <HI>Bashawes,</HI> as if the con∣fining Princes were vp in armes, not onely to take reuenge, as acting one anothers part on such tray∣tors as durst lay hands vpon their Prince, and such a Monarch; but to worke their owne ends for such places, and recouery of such Countries, as the <HI>Turkes</HI> had vsurped both in <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stendome.</HI></P>
<P>Wherupon the <HI>Vizier Hazein Basshaw</HI> by way of preuention very cautelous demeaned himselfe, and in the name of his Emperour <HI>Mustapha</HI> sent out his seuerall Ambassadors for the renouation of those ancient contracts &amp; conditions of peace betweene the Princes of Asia and Europe, and yet retayning the maiesty of the <HI>Othoman</HI> glory, hee insinuated with none, but the <HI>Persian,</HI> and <HI>Empe∣rour of Germany:</HI> onely hee laid a strict command vpon the <HI>Basshawes</HI> of the Prouinces, both to maintaine the dignity of the Common-wealth, and the peace of the Cities.</P>
<P>Among whom the Ambassador that came to the Emperour, not onely obtayned a resolute combi∣nation of peace, but a faire admission of amitie, in∣somuch that the <HI>Transiluanian Prince</HI> had a relax∣ation of his tribute, and augmentation of his go∣uernment, so that hee thought it meet to com∣pound with the Emperour, that he might the bet∣ter preuent the incursions and abuses of the <HI>Iani∣zaries,</HI> if they should in this turbulent time either
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>breake into <HI>Hungary,</HI> or trouble his owne Coun∣try: but the <HI>Basshaw</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI> being as carefull as himselfe, had alwayes preparations ready, both to intercept the malignity of time, concerning his own rebels, and the terror of trouble from the <HI>Cof∣sacks</HI> of <HI>Poland:</HI> in all which he was countenanced by the Emperor, and emboldned through this new combination of peace betweene the Empe∣rour and the great <HI>Turke.</HI></P>

<P>THe Emperor as it were thriuing in all his de∣signes, in the acquisition of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and the preuailings of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> especially in the ap∣peasing of a seditious tumult in <HI>Prague,</HI> where he shewed them the power of a stronger arme, and taught them this discipline, that the end of treason was death, and punishment attended the delin∣quents against the law; seemed yet weary of ex∣tremities, and practised another way, yea diuers o∣ther waies (as I may say) to corroborate his great∣nesse, and reconcile the affaires of the Com∣monwealth. First, he proclaimed peace and qui∣ernesse to all that would returne to his obedience. Secondly, he admitted the Prince of <HI>Anholt</HI> and many Lords into his fauour; yea he repealed the proscriptions of the Marquesse of <HI>Iaggendorf,</HI> the Counts of <HI>Thorne</HI> father and sonne, and others who had maintained <HI>Glatz,</HI> and the reuolted Townes of <HI>Morauia</HI> against him; who yet stood on their guard, and kept themselues secure in their fast holds. Thirdly, hee countenanced the <HI>Prote∣stants</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>in <HI>Vienna</HI> and many other places, whereby they continued their assemblies, so that you shall haue 50. Coaches at a Sermon: and in <HI>Stiria, Ca∣rinthia, Corrinola, Croatia,</HI> they meet without feare or danger, yea they pray for their brethren in the <HI>Valtoline:</HI> all which he endures, and sees a great alteration by this quiet course and conniuency. Fourthly, he hath changed many gouernors both in <HI>Morauia</HI> and <HI>Silesia,</HI> and written to the Bishops to be as sparing in their authortty, as may stand with the dignity of the <HI>Romane Church.</HI> Fiftly, hee hath proclaimed diuers Diets and Assemblies at <HI>Auspurg, Regenspurg, Ratisbona,</HI> and other places, whither he hath gone with his Empresse in person, and beene entertained with triumphs, inuiting as it were the Princes of the Empire to maintaine their accustomed solemnities, and decide the pre∣sent controuersies for the rectifying the disorders of the Common-wealth. Last of all, perceiuing a kind of thinnesse in these Assemblies, and that nei∣ther <HI>Saxony, Brandenburg, Brunswicke, Hess,</HI> nor many other Princes graced the places with their presence; he caused the Empresse to write vnto the Duke of <HI>Saxony;</HI> whose Letters were to this effect:</P>

<P>It hath beene heretofore generally proclaimed that whosoeuer would obey the Church of Rome, and submit to the Spanish gouernment, should haue restauration of estates, and quietnesse of life; but many contested against it, and the preuailers turned their admonitions into fury, and ran ouer the Country with slaughter: some they beheaded &amp; set vpon poles; some they cut out their tongues, some they punished in other manner, and some they sent into the inquisition at <HI>Millane;</HI> amongst whom as the Souldiers in their searches lighted
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>vpon certaine Ministers, and Noblemen and wo∣men, there was a Gentlewoman of great yeares in the rancke of our Ladies, fourescore at the least, na∣med <HI>Maddona Paola,</HI> who was at the first intrea∣ted by many perswasiue reasons to forsake her Re∣ligion and come to the vnity of the Mother Church: but her reply was the Story of the three Children, who would not kneele to <HI>Nabuchadne∣zars</HI> Image, and when they added the terror of the punishment, shee smiled in their faces and told them they should see the Angell to protect her, which answer they imputed to frenzie and the dotage of her yeares, and so all enrag'd and ex∣asperated, they reuiled her and condemned her to the fire, yea to bee burnt in a publike <HI>Piazza:</HI> so the inquisitors went cautelously to worke, and not only bound her hands but gagd her mouth, and so brought her to the stake among them all: but it should seeme the fire had quickly power of her cordes and her hands were as quickly at liberty, so that ere shee dyed shee shewed such signes of ioy &amp; alacrity of spirit, such a liuely countenance, such clapping of her hands, such lifting them vp to heauen, such pointing to the people, and then to heauen, that ere she was confumed to cynders, the thousands of people shed as many teares, and departed a way murmurring and discontented. In this estate standeth the whole Country of the <HI>Grizons</HI> at this hower, and so by the aduice of the <HI>Swiffe,</HI> they haue implored the Maiesty of <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Signory</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> the King of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the States of the vnited

<P>They write from hence, that there was neuer so Wise, Honourable, and iudicious a Counsell about the Pope, as is now, nor were there Cardinals in their Conclaue so reposed, and addicted to reformation before: Insomuch that many enormities haue beene punished, and both Priests, Fryers, and Curtezans, restrained from that former iustifying of their impi∣ous liues in so publicke a manner, yea many good de∣crees haue of late beene enacted, and sundry Consti∣tutions sent abroad to be practised.</P>
<P N="1">1 First, that there was a new Bull proclaymed, for auoyding all deceit and partiality in Electing their Popes.</P>
<P N="2">2 Secondly, that those wonderfull fulminations against Heretickes, should not be executed with Fire and Sword in so publique a manner as was wont: in∣somuch, that whereas the most expected the Bishop of <HI>Spalato</HI> should haue beene condemned to the Fire, hee was pardoned, reconciled, and admitted to enioy his honours and substance.</P>

<P N="4">4 Fourthly, that although the rotten branches of the Vine were to be broken, pruned, and cut off, yea cast into the Fire, which is meant by obstinate Here∣tickes: yet was it no Doctrine of the mother Church

<P>The affaires of the <HI>Grizons</HI> ouer-clouded with so many misfortunes, drawe them from the line of Na∣ture to the meanes of preseruations, and so by the co∣adiutement of the <HI>Swisse</HI> their neighbours, they not onely acquainted their confederates with the mise∣ries, that had plunged them into the gulph of discon∣tent, but implored the assistance of many Princes to remember the <HI>Antiqua foedera,</HI> &amp; not suffer them to be forsaken in this losse of their Liberty, and troubling of their conscience: amongst whom it is said, that one <HI>Andrea Planta</HI> was sent to the Signiory of <HI>Venice</HI> with intimation of their Estates, and imploration of their helpe, who was so well entertained, that his mes∣sage was not onely accepted, but many faire promi∣ses returned to their satisfaction: his Message had these or the like passages.</P>

<HEAD>The Grizons message to Venice.</HEAD>
<P>HIgh and Mighty: I come not to renouate your memoryes, concerning the combination be∣tweene vs, and the amitv of our Countries, nor to meddle with the cause of Religion, which of it selfe were sufficient to moue a pitty: but to plead the policies of State, and vrge an ancient position by way of Caution: <HI>Tum tuares agitur, paries cumproximus ar∣det,</HI> your Marchants cannot Traficke into Germany, and vent the commodities of your Countrey, for now
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>all is stopt, or blockt vp, so that you must with a vigi∣lant eye fore-see the danger to come and preuent the worst: you see what is done already, neither could the Snow of the mountaines, nor the Mountaines themselues, the passages of the Woods, the cut out∣wayes, the steepy ascendings, the plashing of the pines, the anfractus of the Hilles, the roaring of the Waters, the danger of the pits hinder them, but they are come thus farre already: They began with the Fort <HI>Fuentes,</HI> they continued with their Garrisons in many places, and now they haue ended in a manner with the possession of our whole Territories, so that if this inundation be not stopped, iudge your selues, whether it will flow, if it breake down the bankes, &amp; if we be not relieued in time, may it not proue a rub to gall others, aswell as our selues: therefore I leaue it to your further consideration, and so without either ag∣grauating the cause, or exasperating the aduersary, I conclude, that there is no husbandry in letting these plants ouerspread the ground.</P>

<P>To this effect was the Message of the Grizons, but their Answer was not published, onely it was whispe∣red, that if the King of <HI>France</HI> did not send the Duke <HI>de Rohan,</HI> as principall Commaunder, they would in∣uite Count <HI>Mansfeld</HI> to vndertake the busines, and be Lieutenant Generall of those Forces, which should be there imployed: in the meane while they fortefied all the maritine Townes of <HI>Histria,</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> filled the Gulph with Gallyes, and sent two Galenzes to lye betweene the point of <HI>Calabria</HI> and <HI>Candy.</HI></P>

<P>The great resort of Noble men and women out of <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Grizons</HI> and <HI>France</HI> in the time of these
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>troubles and persecutions to <HI>Geneua,</HI> as a sanctuary hath filled both the Towne so the Countrey, that a great dearth and famine followed, insomuch that Wheat exceeded our rates, &amp; a Bushel is worth twen∣ty shillings sterling, whereupon the Magistrates fea∣red some greater mischiefe, as that the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> would take aduantage on their distresse and pestring of people, because they heard of diuers Mustrings, and that the King of France determined to meet him at <HI>Lions:</HI> But God hath the keyes of the hearts of Princes, and openeth and shutteth them at his plea∣sure: so they heard no more of hostile inuasion, nor a word was whispered of any proiects against them, not withstanding they stood on their guard, and besides their continuall Prayers within, had as continuall Garrisons and watches without, so that withall care and diligence they fortified their Ports, and manned their Fortifications: yea such was the especiall fauour of God towards them, that all other prouision bare low prices, and for all this scarcity of Corne, their ve∣ry neighbours and aduersaries, I meane the Catholike <HI>Cantons</HI> and <HI>Bazill</HI> it selfe, supplyed their wants, and contributed money to their reliefe.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="11"/>the truth is, the siluer Fleet is not yet arriued, but ra∣ther is so watched by the Holanders in those parts, that they cannot make that speede as is desired, so that there is as great complaining for want of money, as euer before, notwithstanding the King not onely enlargeth his Court, but hath proceeded very nobly in diuers reformations, and set downe especiall ordi∣nances for the augmentation of his owne honour, and detention of the Subiect in modest rules of duty and obseruation, so that neither can euery man come to the Court as they were wont, nor those that come, passe to such places, as they accustomed.</P>

<P>It hath pleased God so to diuert the King from pro∣secuting the warre against his Subiects, that heere is euery where a cheerefull face of concord and amity, and we doe not heare of any man that hath opposed against the message of the Swiss and Grizons, but that the King is willing to admit of their imploration for the defence, or if you will regayning the <HI>Valtoline,</HI> for which purpose there hath beene reciprocall Em∣bassies betweene the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> and him, as farre as sending of Presents, and resolution to continue a peace: but they neuer met in person, onely the Prince of <HI>Piemont</HI> and his wife haue beene at <HI>Lions,</HI> and great ioy is made on all sides for the hopes men haue to thriue in their expectation, especially considering the Archbishop of <HI>Rheimes</HI> proposeth nothing, but obe∣dience to the Church, and an Vnity in Religion, disclaiming the Iesuites, intermedling with State matters, and pestilentiall deuises, to set all in an vp∣rore againe: there hath passed diuers courtesies be∣tweene

<P>The waters haue come downe so fast this Winter, that they haue remoued <HI>Tilly</HI> from <HI>Frankendale,</HI> where that worthy Sergeant Maior <HI>Borregh</HI> hath not onely defended the place, but made many sallyes to the en∣damaging the Enemy, and supplying his own wants: but as I beleeue, neither <HI>Bauaria</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or he hath a purpose to continue there.
