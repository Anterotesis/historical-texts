By reason whereof, the said Lords and Commons hold it fit, That some constant and indifferent way should be had and esta∣blished, for the Leavying of Moneyes for the future maintenance of the Parliament Forces, and other great Affairs of the Common wealth; whereby the Malignants and Neutralls may be compelled to pay their pro∣portionable parts of the said Charges, and the Subjects in generall be rated and taxed with as much ease and indifferency as may be: For which pur∣pose, an Ordinance was lately made by the said Lords and Commons, for
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> setting of a Charge, or new Impost upon the severall Commodities in a Schedule thereunto annexed specified. Now for the better and more spee∣dy advancement of this work, and the more easie Payment of the said Charge, and for other weighty considerations, the said Lords and Commons have thought fit to alter the said former Rates, and to impose other and lower Charges upon the severall Commodities in a Schedule hereunto an∣nexed expressed, then were imposed by the said former Ordinance; And do therefore Ordain, That the said former Ordinance, and every matter therein contained, be hereby adnulled and repealed, and not to be put in execution in all or any part thereof, by any person or persons whatsoever, but that this present Ordinance do take effect, and be observed by all and every person and persons, as if the said former Ordinance had not been made.
