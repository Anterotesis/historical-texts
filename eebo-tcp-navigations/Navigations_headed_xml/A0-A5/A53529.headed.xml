<HEAD>PROLOGUE To a New PLAY, called Venice Preserv'd; OR <HI>THE PLOT DISCOVERED. At the Duke's Theatre, Spoken by Mr.</HI> SMITH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN these unsettl'd Times, when each man dreads</L>
<L>The Bloody Stratagems of buisy Heads,</L>
<L>When we have fear'd three years I know not what,</L>
<L>Till Witnesses begin to die oth' Root,</L>
<L>What made our Poet meddle with a <HI>Plot?</HI></L>
<L>Was't that he fanci'd, for the very sake</L>
<L>And name of Plot, his trifling Play might take?</L>
<L>For there's not in't one Inch-board-evidence;</L>
<L>But is to each man's reason plain and sense:</L>
<L>And that he thinks a plausible defence.</L>
<L>Were Truth by Sense and Reason to be try'd;</L>
<L>Sure all our Swearers might be laid aside.</L>
<L>No, of such Tools our Author has no need,</L>
<L>To make his Plot, or make his Play succeed.</L>
<L>He of Black-Bills has no prodigious Tales,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Spanish-pilgrims</HI> thrown ashoar in <HI>Wales.</HI></L>
<L>Here's not one murdr'd Magistrate, at least</L>
<L>Kept rank, like Ven'son, for a City-feast:</L>
<L>Grown four dayes stiff, the better to prepare</L>
<L>And fit his plyant Limbs to ride in Chair,</L>
<L>Here are no Truths of such a Monstrous stature,</L>
<L>And some believe there are none such in Nature.</L>
<L>But here's an Army rais'd, though under ground,</L>
<L>Yet no Men seen, nor one Commission found.</L>
<L>Here is a Traitor too, that's very old,</L>
<L>Turbulent, subtile, mischeivous and bold,</L>
<L>Bloody, Revengeful; and to Crown his Part,</L>
<L>Loves fumbling with a Wench with all his heart,</L>
<L>And after having many Changes past,</L>
<L>In spight of Age, thanks Heav'n he's Hang'd at last.</L>
<L>Next, here's a Senator that keeps a Whore:</L>
<L>In <HI>Venice</HI> none a higher Office bore:</L>
<L>To Lewdness every night the Leacher ran:</L>
<L>Shew me in <HI>London</HI> such another man:</L>
<L>Match him at Mother <HI>Creswels</HI> if you can:</L>
<L>Ah <HI>Poland, Poland,</HI> had it been thy Lot</L>
<L>T' have heard in time of this <HI>Venetian-Plot,</HI></L>
<L>Thou surely chosen hadst one Plot from thence,</L>
<L>And honour'd Them, as thou hast <HI>England</HI> since.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE <HI>to the same.</HI> Spoken by Mr. <HI>BETTERTON.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THe Text is done, and now for Application:</L>
<L>And when that's ended, give your Approbation.</L>
<L>Tho' the Conspiracy's prevented Here,</L>
<L>Methinks I see another Hatching There.</L>
<L>And there's a certain Faction fain would sway,</L>
<L>If they had strength enough, and damn this Play;</L>
<L>But this the Author boldly bad me say.</L>
<L>If any take his plainness in ill part,</L>
<L>He's glad on't from the bottom of his Heart.</L>
<L>Poets in honour of the Truth should Write,</L>
<L>With the same Courage Brave Men for it Fight.</L>
<L>And tho' against him causeless hatred rise,</L>
<L>And dayly where he goes of late he spies</L>
<L>The Frowns of sullen and revengeful Eyes.</L>
<L>'Tis what he knows, with much contempt, to bear,</L>
<L>And serves a Cause to good to let him fear.</L>
<L>He fears no Poyson from an incens'd Drab,</L>
<L>No Ruffians five foot Sword, nor Rascals Stab:</L>
<L>Nor any other Snares of Mischief, laid,</L>
<L>Not a <HI>Rose-Ally,</HI> Cudgel, Ambuscade.</L>
<L>From any privat Cause where Malice Reigns,</L>
<L>Or general Pique, that Blockheads have to Brains.</L>
<L>Nothing shall daunt his Pen when Truth doth call,</L>
<L>No, not the Picture-Mangler at <HI>Guild-hall.</HI></L>
<L>The Rebel Tribe (of which that Vermin's one)</L>
<L>Have now set forward, and the Course begun.</L>
<L>And while that Prince's Figure they deface,</L>
<L>Durst their base Fears but look him in the Face,</L>
<L>As they before had Massacred His Name,</L>
<L>They'd use His Person as they've us'd his Fame.</L>
<L>A Face, in which such Lineaments they Read,</L>
<L>Of that Great Martyr, whose Rich Blood they Shed,</L>
<L>That their Rebellious Hate they still maintain,</L>
<L>And, in his Son, would Murder Him again.</L>
<L>With Indignation then let each brave Heart,</L>
<L>Rowze and Unite to take His Injur'd Part,</L>
<L>Till Royal Love and Goodness call Him Home,</L>
<L>And Songs of Triumph meet Him as He come.</L>
<L>Till Heaven His Honour and His Peace Restore,</L>
<L>And Villains never wrong His Vertue more.</L>
