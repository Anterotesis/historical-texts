<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR frequent Skirmishes and Fights, that have lattely hap∣pened her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> betwixt the Protestants and Papists, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ppose, has created some False and Erro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Reports; therefore I have diligently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nquired into the Truth of them all; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Exact Account to be as followeth.</P>
<P>That Collonel <HI>Sarsefield,</HI> with a de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch'd Party of Five Thousand choice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, out of the <HI>Irish</HI> Army, and joined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith Two Thousand of the <HI>Connaught</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces, came first against <HI>James-Town;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Garrison not finding themselves able to engage with so great Numbers, as the <HI>Irish</HI> were, retreated thence to <HI>Sli∣go;</HI> killing in their Retreat, many of the <HI>Irish,</HI> with the loss of very few of their own Party, though <HI>Sarsefield</HI> pur∣sued them close to the Town; where Collonel <HI>Russel,</HI> with the Horse under his Command, apprehending <HI>Sarsefield's</HI> Party to be too strong for them, re∣treated to <HI>Bellishannon,</HI> advising the Foot also to quit the Town: But one Mon∣sieur de St. <HI>Sauvem,</HI> who commanded about Two Hundred Foot, most Grana∣deers, and Collonel <HI>Loyd,</HI> with the <HI>Innis∣killing</HI>
<PB REF="2"/> Foot, bravely stood to it, resol∣ving to Fight the Enemy; and upon their approaching the Town, the <HI>French</HI> Captain, with his Men; went and took a Pass, not far from the Town; which he maintained, against all <HI>Sarsefield's</HI> Force, till all their Ammunition was spent; the Monsieur himself, an Excellent Marks-Man, often Fireing in the Head of them; after which, he and his Men Retreated to the Town, with no great loss, and defen∣ded themselves with their Baggonets in their Muskets, till they took Possession of Two the Forts beyond the Town. The <HI>French</HI> Captain; and his Party, possessing the Lower <HI>Forth;</HI> and <HI>Loyd,</HI> with the <HI>Inniskilling</HI> Men, went to the Upper <HI>Forth;</HI> from whence <HI>Loyd</HI> that Night, went towards <HI>Inniskilling,</HI> falling on the <HI>Irish,</HI> in a Pass which he was to go over, and killing Two Hundred, not losing Fifteen himself: The <HI>French</HI> in their Re∣treat, carried Fire and Provisions into the <HI>Forth,</HI> wherein they found Three Barrels of Powder, with which they defended themselves bravely for Three Days; and on the Third at Night, the <HI>Irish</HI> lying secure in the Town, they sallied from the <HI>Forth,</HI> on the <HI>Irish,</HI> killed about Two Hundred, and drove the rest out of the Town; which Account being brought to Duke <HI>Schomberg,</HI> he dispatch'd away all the <HI>Inniskilling</HI> Horse, and Draggoons, with Two Regiments of <HI>Inniskilling</HI> Foot, Two Regiments of <HI>English</HI> Horse, and one of Draggoons; so that we may very suddenly expect a good Account from that Expedition, if they reach <HI>Sarse∣field,</HI> before they quit <HI>Sligo.</HI></P>
<P>There is also one arrived here, who left <HI>Dublin</HI> lately, who informs us, that the Late King <HI>James</HI> was returned from his Camp, that the <HI>Irish</HI> had lost at least Fifteen Thousand of their Army by Dis∣eases; that a very Malignant Feavour did rage in their Camp, and followed them to their Winter-Quatters; that Six Regi∣ments of their Horse were gone to Quar∣ter in <HI>Munster;</HI> that the <HI>Ʋlster</HI>-Men, with their Herds flying from thence, had eat up all the Grass, and Hay, in East and West <HI>Meathes,</HI> County of <HI>Kildare, King</HI> and <HI>Queens</HI> County, and were going to∣wards <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ster;</HI> that in all probabil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they would destroy all the Forage of the County; for (he says) they drive Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Thousand Head of <HI>Ʋlster</HI> Cattle i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Drove, and enter on any Man's Grou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and eat up all his Hay, Grass, Corn, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pettadoes; and so from Farm to Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our all. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Report also, that they had the Accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in <HI>Dublin,</HI> of the Lord <HI>Dover</HI>'s Land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the West, from <HI>France,</HI> with only o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ship, having lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a small Ship, Lad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Arms and Ammunition, which the said was taken by the <HI>English</HI> Fleet; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heard of no other Ships arriving fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>France,</HI> when he left <HI>Dublin.</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> says, that the <HI>Irish</HI> Court at <HI>Dublin</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not (in their usual manner) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gantly Joyful, either for the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Landing, or for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arsefield's</HI> Success at <HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Town,</HI> or <HI>Sligo,</HI></P>
<P>Our last Letters likewise from <HI>Irela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> informs us, assured<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, That the Detach¦ments, which the Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Besiege <HI>Charlemont,</HI> is now actually be¦fore the Place; and laying a close Siege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and bombarding it: That since the Surre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦der of <HI>Sligo,</HI> (which the Inhabitants h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> done on very Honourable Terms) the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rebels had sent out a Detachement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both Horse and Dragoons, to Ravage an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spoil the Country round about, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Inconvenience and Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the poor Protestants, and Inhabitants those parts: But that the Duke of <HI>Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣berg,</HI> to prevent, if possible, all the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦struction and Mischief, that might happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thereupon, had sent out a considerab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Detachement, either to engage them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Battle, or to stop their Barbarous Procee¦dings; which expedient, has Miraculous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> put great Heart and Life into the Coun∣try People: And we doubt not, but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very short time, to give you a good Ac¦count of the quelling those Rebels.</P>
<P>We have also a fresh Account, of taking several Ships from <HI>France,</HI> bount for <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> one Laden with Iron-Hoops; and a second with Arms and Ammunition, con∣sisting of at least Two Hundred Tuns, &amp;c. which is all that at present comes from him, who is your Friend and Servant.</P>
