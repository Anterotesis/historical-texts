<HEAD><HI>To which Propositions the late Company on the 28</HI> May <HI>1692. put in their Answer in these words,</HI> viz.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="response to propositions">
<HEAD>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tho' (as ap∣pears by the Style) 'tis ra∣ther, <HI>The Inso∣lent Answer,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Humble Answer of the Governour, Deputy Governour, and Court of Com∣mittees of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company; to a Paper of <HI>Propositions</HI> for Re∣gulation of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company; Received from the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> Their Majesties Principal Secretary of State.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Proposition. <HI>THE Fund to be made up</HI></HI> 1500000 l. <HI>at least, and not to exceed Two Millions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The Company do humbly averr, and are ready to Prove, to the King's Most Excellent Majesty's Satisfaction, That their pre∣sent quick and <HI>dead Stock and Revenue</HI> is of more Real Value than the said Sum of 1100000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Prop. <HI>The Stock of the present Company to be part of this Fund, and to be rated at</HI></HI> 744000 l. <HI>if they can give Security, that it shall Effectually produce that Sum; or else at so much less as they will engage to make good after all Debts paid, and Satisfaction made to the</HI> Mogull <HI>and his Subjects; against whose Pretensions the New Stock to be indemnified by the like Security.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Company recommending <HI>their Righteous Cause to GOD,</HI> and His Majesties known and famous Justice in the whole course of his happy Life, say, That <HI>The Value of every Thing is
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>what it will Sell for;</HI> and their Stock, under all the Calumnies and Persecutions of their Adversaries, now currently Sells for 150 l. per <HI>Hundred:</HI> and they know and can prove it to be intrinsecally more worth than that currant Price: But <HI>they know no Law or Rea∣son,</HI> why they should be dispossessed of their Estates, at any less Value than they are really worth in ready Money, by all the Mea∣sures any thing is valued in any part of the World.</P>
<P>They humbly say, as to Security, <HI>They know no Reason</HI> why they should give Security for their own Estates.</P>
<P>They affirm, That they owe not a Penny to <HI>the Great</HI> Mogull, <HI>or any of his Subjects,</HI> other than their running Accounts with their own <HI>Banyans</HI> and Brokers, which are changing daily, like Merchants running Cash in a Goldsmith's hand.</P>
<P>Although the Company owe nothing to the <HI>Mogull,</HI> as afore∣said, yet the bare mentioning any such thing by a Publick Act of His Majesty, would be enough to perswade Him to invent Demands upon the Company, for Transactions and Pretences, done in Ages past, before any of the present Adventurers were born; and there∣fore that part of the Proposition seems <HI>Manifestly Impossible as well as Ʋnjust,</HI> neither the <HI>Mogull</HI> nor any of his Subjects having made any Complaint to His Majesty, of the Companies being in Debt to him or them: That being only a Suggestion of the Interlopers and their Adherents, not only now, but for many years past.</P>
<P>As to that <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> if they can give Security, It will not become the Company to say what they might of their own A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ility, or the Ability or Disability of their Adversaries, they are on both sides well known upon the Exchange.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Prop. <HI>That the said Stock of the present Company shall be brought home at any time within <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/>years in the Ships abroad, or those to be sent on account of the New Stock, paying the same Freight, and disposed of at Publick Sales by the Members of the pre∣sent Company, and the Nett-proceed thereof to be taken as part of the</HI></HI> 744000 l. <HI>as shall also the Value of their Forts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to be Estimated by indifferent persons, and put into the hands of the New-Charter Company: But after <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> days, no Goods to be Exported to the</HI> East Indies <HI>on Account of the Old Stock.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Company say they have as real a Right to all their Forts, Cities, Towns, and Territories in <HI>India,</HI> to them and their Successors for ever; as they have to their purchased Lands and Ware-houses in <HI>England</HI> belonging to the Companies Joint-Stock, or other Private Lands or Manors belonging to the particular Ad∣venturers: <HI>Rex Dei Gratia</HI> being Originally the Title by which
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>very many Manors and Lands, Court-Leets and Court-Barons are held in <HI>England.</HI> And as the Company are not willing to be dis∣possessed of their said Real Estate, until they are paid for them; which they believe in their Consciences, hath Cost them at several times above a Million in ready Mony Sterling, besides the Interest. But for the Price that should be paid them for their said Real Estates, if it were come to that single point, they would refer themselves to, and rely upon His Majesties Justice, as aforesaid.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Prop. <HI>That what-ever the quick and dead Stock shall thus produce more than</HI></HI> 744000 l. <HI>shall be divided wholly between the Mem∣bers of the present Company, proportionably to their respective Stocks.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Prop. <HI>Books to be provided for new Subscriptions, within and then the Books to be closed.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Prop. <HI>If the Subscriptions exceed Two Millions, each Sub∣scriber to be Reduced proportionably, till the whole make but Two Millions.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That every Subscriber pay in his Money, upon pain</HI></HI> —</P>
<P>To the IV, V, VI, and VII. <HI>Propositions,</HI> the Company humbly Answer, That they do as little understand the New Subscribers, as they suppose most of those Subscribers know the Affairs of <HI>India:</HI> But the Company know the late new way of Subscribing, without Authority from His Majesty, is an old Practice of Interlopers and others, emulous of the Companies Prosperity; and hath formerly been debated upon the like voluntary Subscriptions several times, and many years since in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; when some of the Lords of His now Majesties most Honourable Privy Council were present: But it always ended, in only giving Unnecessary Trouble to His Majesty and the Company.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Prop. <HI>No One Person to have above</HI></HI> 10000 l. <HI>in this Stock, in his own or others Name, in trust for him, and every Sub∣scriber shall make Oath accordingly; and that it is his Own Money.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This <HI>Proposition,</HI> in Duty to His Majesty, and in Love to our Native Country, the Company must freely declare against, as <HI>being notoriously prejudicial to the Nation,</HI> who-ever the Ad∣venturers are: First, Because Trade is a Free Agent, and must not be Limited or Bounded; if it be so in any Nation, it will never prosper. Secondly, It is against the Laws and Customs of <HI>England,</HI> and all Nations upon the face of the Earth, That any Man that buys a Commodity, and pays honestly for it in Ready Money, should be compelled to Swear it is his Own Money, or whose it is; <HI>this being only a Trick of the first Proposers,</HI> to serve their particular turn, <HI>without any National or other Regard to Right or
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>Publick Good.</HI> Thirdly, If such a Limitation were Advisable, certainly some Nation or other would have hit upon the Expe∣dient before this time: Whereas, on the contrary, the <HI>wise Dutch</HI> indulge and favour the very <HI>Jews,</HI> and the more for Buying the greater Stock; of whom, one Man, by name <HI>Swasso,</HI> had at one time about 75000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock: The <HI>French</HI> King likewise, for the Encouragement of Large Subscriptions in that Stock, propounded many Considerable Priviledges and Immunities, both to Natives and Foreiners, proportionable to the Greatness of their said Subscriptions: The <HI>Danes</HI> likewise (it is said) made a Law not long since, That such as would not Add a certain Proportion to their Stock already Wrote, should Forfeit their Stock; which was a Constraint on the other hand, and as erroneous as that in the aforesaid <HI>Proposition.</HI> Fourthly, Such kind of Levelling or Li∣miting Personal Estates, was never known in Commonwealths, much less in Monarchies. Our <HI>Levellers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and anti∣ently the <HI>Tribunes</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> never pretended to the Limitation of Personal Estates, but of Possessions in Land; and not of all Lands, (not in their Provinces;) but only the Lands of <HI>Italy,</HI> which was the Seat or Country of the Commonwealth. Fifthly, No considerable Man of Fortune or Experience will ever endure the fatigue of continual Study in the <HI>East-India</HI> Companies arduous Affairs, but he will find his Account some way; and that must be either by a Great Reward, or by a Great Stock; or by other and worse ways of paying himself. The most the <HI>English</HI> Companies give a <HI>Committe-Man</HI> is about 50 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> whereas we have heard the <HI>Dutch</HI> allow Mr. <HI>Peter Van Dam</HI> about 800 <HI>l.</HI> and about 400 <HI>l.</HI> a Year to his Son: But such an able active Man's having a great Stock of his own, is better for the Publick Society than any Re∣ward can be allowed him: Because such a Man that is Obliged by Reward only, so to Attend the Companies Business, is tied only by one Cord; but he that expects all Satisfaction to arise from the Profit of his own Stock, is tied with the two great Cords, which do almost the whole Business of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> Reward, by the Profit of his own Great Stock, and Fear of Great Loss, if his own Stock should miscarry by Ill Conduct.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>Prop. <HI>That every Member of the present Company who hath above</HI></HI> 10000 l. <HI>Stock, shall Sell forthwith the Over-plus at the rate of</HI> 100 l. <HI>for</HI> 100 l. <HI>but so that if the whole Nett-proceed of the present Stock exceeds</HI> 744000 l. <HI>this over-plus shall go to the Person that hath Sold his over-plus Stock, proportionably to the Stock he had before such Sale.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Company can see <HI>no Shadow of Reason or Equity in this Proposition;</HI> but <HI>a direct Contradiction to Common Right, and the Admirable Laws of this Kingdom</HI> for Preservation of Property.</P>
<P N="10">X. <HI>Prop. <HI>No Person to have a Vote, that hath in his own Right, and not in Trust, less than</HI></HI> 500 l. <HI>Stock; nor more than One Vote, unless he hath</HI> 4000 l. <HI>and then Two Votes, and if</HI> 6000 l. <HI>Three Votes,</HI> 8000 l. <HI>Four Votes, and</HI> 10000 l. <HI>Five Votes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Company are humbly of Opinion, <HI>This is more justly and equally provided for already in their present Charter;</HI> this Proposal of giving Advantage to the small Stock, being but a <HI>Hy∣steron Proteron, never known before in any part of the World</HI> in Mer∣chants Affairs; wherein as far as the Sun shines all Men Vote ac∣cording to their proper Shares in Shipping, or as they are Interessed more or less, and not otherwise.</P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>Prop. <HI>All Members of the present Company, and new Sub∣scribers to be Incorporated by the Name of</HI></HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>Prop. <HI>All who have, or subscribe</HI></HI> 500 l. <HI>Stock, to meet and choose a Governour, Deputy, and</HI> 24 <HI>Committees to manage the Trade; none to be Governour or Deputy, who hath Subscribed less than</HI> 2000 l. <HI>Stock, nor Committee</HI> 1000 l. <HI>Stock.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. <HI>Prop. <HI>The Governour, Deputy, and Committees to be Cho∣sen every Year; and if any die within the Year, others to be chosen by a General Court.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. <HI>Prop. <HI>The Governour, Deputy, and Committees to take the Oaths of Fidelity; and also an Oath for the faithful Discharge of their Trust.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="15">XV. <HI>Prop. <HI>That every one Purchasing and Stock, shall take his Freedom, and before his Admittance pay <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> for a Fine, and take the Oaths appointed.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In the XI, XII, XIII, XIV, and XV. <HI>Propositions,</HI> the Company can see nothing New, but all is already <HI>Provided for in the same manner, or better, by their present Charters.</HI></P>
<P N="16">XVI. <HI>Prop. <HI>That all free of the former Company, or capable to be so, and all Subscribing to the present Stock, shall be admitted</HI></HI> gratis</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In this there is but <HI>a trivial Dffierence</HI> from the Com∣panies present Charter, which enjoyns all New Adventurers, except the Sons and Servants of Free-men, to Pay 5 <HI>l.</HI> each for their first Admittance. The Old Adventurers have Paid their respe∣ctive 5 <HI>l.</HI> and <HI>we can see no Reason,</HI> if New Men be admitted, why they should not Pay the same.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That the Company hereby Establisht, may make By-Laws for their better Government. That no By-Laws shall be
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>binding to the Company, but such as are approved by a General Court of Adventurers, and are not repugnant to the Laws of the Land.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="18">XVIII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That every General Court and Committee be called by the Governour or Deputy, at all which the Governour or Deputy shall be present, and in case of Equality of Voices, shall have a Casting Voice.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="19">XIX. <HI>Prop. <HI>That the Company shall Enjoy the Sole Trade to the</HI></HI> East-Indies <HI>in the several Countreys lying between the</HI> Cape de Bona Esperanza, <HI>and the Streights of</HI> Magellan.</P>
<P N="20">XX. <HI>Prop. <HI>That it shall not be lawful for any save the said Company only, directly or indirectly to Trade within the Limits granted to the said Company, on pain of Forfeiting</HI></HI> —</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> As to the 17, 18.19, and 20. Propositions, the Company can observe nothing in them that is not already in the same manner in their Charters.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. <HI>Prop. <HI>That no License or Permission shall be Granted to any Persons or Ships, to Trade to the</HI></HI> East-Indies <HI>on any private Ac∣count, and that all such Permissions shall be void.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. This is an unreasonable Proposition, and against the sense of all Charters,</HI> and ought for the Publick Good to be left to the Companies Discretion for some time, (as in the late War with the <HI>Mogull</HI>) permissive Ships have been of great use and publick Benefit, at this time now Peace is restored they are of no use, except in some particular instances which might be given, and in setling of new Plantations, which the Company best know when and how to effect; and <HI>no East-India Company in any part of</HI> Europe <HI>have any such Shackles imposed upon them,</HI> which would but hinder their Progress for the Publick Good and Honour of their Country in many Cases.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That there shall be no private Contract for the Sale of any Goods, but they shall be all Sold in Publick by Inch of Candle for the Companies Account.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="23">XXIII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That no Lott of any Goods to be Sold, shall exceed the Value of</HI></HI> 500 l.</P>
<P><HI>Answ. These two are Novelties, and such as were never imposed upon any</HI> East-India <HI>Company in</HI> Europe, <HI>and are against Natural Right,</HI> and if Establisht, <HI>would tend to the National Prejudice of England,</HI> as the Company doubt not to make evident to His Ma∣jesty by irrefragable instances and Examples, Trade must be Free, for the Publick Good, otherwise it will Die, or Fly away.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. <HI>Prop. <HI>Every Year the Company shall deliver to their Majesties use</HI></HI> 500 <HI>Tuns of Salt-Peter at</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> per Tun <HI>if required, the refraction not exceeding</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The Company will always serve Their Majesties with <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> as Cheap as they can afford it, and doubt not but to please Their Majesties therein, as they have done all their Royal Prede∣cessors: But to be limited to a certain Price or Quantity or Refra∣ction, <HI>Is a Novelty that was never Imposed upon this or any</HI> East-India <HI>Company,</HI> and it had been an unhappy Accident for <HI>England</HI> if such an Imposition or Constraint had been laid upon the Company 10 or 20 years past, for if that had been done, there could not have been one fourth part of the <HI>Peter</HI> in <HI>England</HI> as the Company had in Store (which was about 3000 Tuns) when this War with <HI>France</HI> begun. <HI>There is a Famous Story</HI> confirming the Truth of this, in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. there was at that time a great Dearth of Corn, which occasioned His Majesty to send for the <HI>East-Land</HI> Company, and His Majesty told them, That in regard of the present Dearth of Corn, and for Relief of the Poor, they must Load all their Ships homeward Bound with Corn, which they promised faithfully to do, and were so dismissed; but one of the Lords of the Council told His Majesty such a Promise signified nothing, be∣cause they had not promised at what Rate they would Sell their Wheat when it came, on which they were called in again, and told the King was not satisfied with that Answer: To whith the Deputy who was <HI>a Famous Hunter,</HI> replyed, Sir We will Freight our Ships and Buy our Corn as Cheap as we can, and Sell it here as cheap as we can afford it; But to be confined to any certain Price we can∣not, That Lord pressed the Deputy for a more certain Answer, on which the Deputy said fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her to the King, Sir, Your Majesty is a Lover of the Noble Sport of Hunting, and so am I, and I keep a few Dogs, but if my Dogs do not love the Sport as well as I, I might as well Hunt with Hogs, as with Dogs. The King replied, Say no more, Man, thou art in the Right; go and do as well as you can, but be sure bring Corn.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. <HI>Prop. <HI>That the Company shall Yearly Export to the</HI></HI> East-Indies <HI>not less than the Value of</HI> 100000 l. <HI>in Goods, of the Product and Manufactures of</HI> England.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Company may do this in some years, and sometimes more, and sometimes not so much, when their Cloth lyes unsold, and is eaten up with Moths and white Ants in <HI>India:</HI> This ought for the Publick Good, <HI>to be left to the Companies discretion.</HI></P>
<P N="26">XXVI. <HI>Prop. <HI>That all Dividends be made in Money.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is commonly done here and beyond Sea, in other Companies; but some Instances may be given, wherein it would be highly Prejudicial to make this Confinement of the Companies Li∣berty.
<PB N="12" REF="8"/><HI>So it ought to be left to discretion;</HI> as it is now here, and in all other Nations</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That no Dividend be made without leaving the Original Fund, or at least</HI></HI> 1500000 <HI> l. besides what is necessary to pay their Debts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is a Discretionary Rule the Company do now ob∣serve: But was never Injoyned them by any Charter, <HI>neither is there any Company in the World so Circumscribed, nor ought to be, for the Publick Good. It is against Natural Right,</HI> that any Men should be Barr'd from doing what they think fit with their own Estates.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That the said Companies Accomptant keep a Book to enter the Value of the</HI></HI> Stock <HI>upon Oath, to lie Open for the perusal of all persons concerned.</HI></P>
<P N="29">XXIX. <HI>Prop. <HI>That all Transferrs of</HI></HI> Stock <HI>shall be Registred and Entred in a Book, to lie open to all persons concerned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The 28 and 29 <HI>Prop.</HI> are Provided for in the same manner already by the Company.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. <HI>Prop. <HI>That the said Joint-Stock shall continue for</HI></HI> 21 <HI>years and no longer.</HI></P>
<P N="31">XXXI. <HI>Prop. <HI>That a Book of new Subscriptions be laid open for a succeeding new General Joint-Stock before the expiration of the said</HI></HI> 21 <HI>years appointed for this Stock.</HI></P>
<P>Answ. <HI>This is so strange, that if it should be admitted, would make the Company Ridiculous all the World over:</HI> and is as much as to say, a Man shall be Obliged to Plant a great Orchard, and Remove his Trees, or Depart from his Possession at the end of 21 Years; or to Build a famous Mansion-House, a Town, or City upon such Terms. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Company have Spent within 30 or 40 Years past, above 700000 <HI>l.</HI> upon <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and have not yet seen their Principal, by about 400000 <HI>l.</HI> to this day: this Company have been Building and Fortifying at <HI>Bencolen</HI> about 10 or 11 Years, and they must proceed in Building and Fortifying there for 20 or 30 Years to come; and in that chargeable and dangerous Work they have spent near 250 <HI>l.</HI> to 300000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling. And though indeed by that necessary Work they have preserved the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pper Trade to this Nation, yet they have not Received any thing towards the Charge of these Disbursements: and that Place will cost the Com∣pany 200000 <HI>l.</HI> more, before it can bemade a complete, secure, (and morally speaking) an impregnable <HI>Asylum</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> Nation. <HI>It is a most Impolitick Notion,</HI> That any Company can Thrive by frequent Change of Conduct and Council, any more than a Nation by often Changing the Fundamental Laws. The
<PB N="13" REF="8"/><HI>Dutch</HI> Company stands as it did from the Beginning, and the <HI>English</HI> hath never been Changed that the Company knows of, but once in <HI>O. Cromwell</HI>'s time; and then it was done with their own consent. <HI>The Company, by the true Rules of Policy, ought never to Alter,</HI> nor any Man be Forced to Sell his Stock, any more than he can be forced to Buy a Stock that hath none: Or any Gentleman that hath an over-grown Estate in Land in any Countrey, can be forced to Sell part, to make way for some new Purchasers, that pretend they will Buy Land in that Countrey.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That the Company be obliged for the better and more secure carrying on of this Trade to have <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> Ships of their own.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is <HI>such a Constraining Proposition</HI> as was never made to any Company; all Companies having Ships of their own, and hired Ships; and best know when to use the one or the other; and there are few Merchants considerable in <HI>Europe,</HI> that have not both: <HI>And it was never thought or found Political, to put Trade into such strait-laced Bodies,</HI> which instead of making it grow upright and prosper, will either kill it, or force it to grow awry.</P>
<P>This was <HI>the Language,</HI> with which the Late Company treated those Honourable Lords; calling some of their <HI>Propositions Impossible as well as Ʋnjust;</HI> others, <HI>Notoriously Prejudicial to the Nation;</HI> one, <HI>Without any Shadow of Reason or Equity;</HI> another, <HI>A Trick;</HI> another, <HI>A most Impolitick Notion,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="propositions to the propositions">
<HEAD>Having Answered <HI>the aforesaid</HI> Propositions, <HI>the</HI> Company <HI>humbly desire that</HI> the following Propositions <HI>may be Con∣sidered.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>FIrst,</HI> If any Alteration should be made ofthe present Consti∣tution by His Majesty, the same Men, <HI>viz.</HI> Interlopers and their Adherents, and such as have sold their Stock at high rates, and then cry down the Company to fright the Adventurers, and come in again at low rates; whether such sort of Men, after His Majesty hath granted a New Charter, will not, to serve another turn, Ex∣claim against it, in defamation of His Majesties just Prerogative.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether any thing such Men have said, that carries any appearanc of Truth, be not the same again which was said above 20 years past, and many times since in the two last Reigns, and as often Answered and Confuted.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whether the Spirit of Clamour and Opposition against the Company, which centers in some few known Persons, whether those persons be men of better Fortune, or more regular Lives, or greater Prudence, or otherwise preferrible to the present Adven∣turers in the <HI>East-India</HI>-Company-Stock.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Whether considering the two Wars this Company have grappled with in <HI>India,</HI> and a worse kind of Civil Broil the Inter∣lopers forced them to, more pernicious to the Company than both the Wars in <HI>India;</HI> whether the Company, notwithstanding their said Pressures, hath not Managed their Affairs to as much National Advantage, and Profit to their Fellow-Adventurers, as any <HI>East-India</HI> Company▪ in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That without Restraint, Cramping, or taking Care for Rotaions or Changes in the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, the whole Stock, without such forced Political Restrictment or Limitation, is in a kindly, natural, and continual Changing Motion; in so much that the Value of the Stock, once in Two Years or therabout, changes Owners; and there is not now in the present Committee Three Men that were of the Committee above Twenty Years past.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> That the present Governour Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> about Nine Years past had no Stock at all, nor Sir <HI>Joseph Herne</HI> the late Go∣vernour, about 20 years past, nor Sir <HI>William Langhorne</HI> now one of the greatest Adventurers, 4 years since; and several other Consi∣derable Adventurers not above 2 years past, they came in by seve∣ral Purchases, and many at much dearer Rates than the present Price Currant of the Stock; and there is now of the present Com∣mittee Five Worthy Persons very late Purchasers, which were never of the Committee before this Year.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> If it be thought by any that Envy the Companies good Fortune, that some few of the Company are too Rich and Powerful in the Committee, the Company answer that to Cure that if it be a Fault, there needs no new Laws nor Articles in any Charter, for a very few years will cure that without such preternatural force, for that the Sons of such Men were never known to succeed their Fathers in the painful Fatigue of the Companies Affairs, but did always settle themselves upon an easier course of Life by a Reve∣nue in Land.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> If there be some of the present Adventurers that had Courage enough to keep their Stock, and never Sold any part thereof during all those violent and unreasonable Attempts that have been made against the Company, whether such persons do not rather Deserve the Thanks which the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate gave <HI>Te∣rentius Varro, quod non Desperasset de Republica,</HI> than any Blame.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> The Company, nor peradventure any great business in the World did ever Thrive where some One or Two Men, or ve∣ry few did not arrive to so much Reputation (as <HI>Machiavel</HI> calls it) as to be able to moderate the Councils of the Common-wealth or Society; so it's now in the <HI>Netherlands East-India</HI> Company, and so it was ever in the <HI>English East-India</HI> Company, except for the first Seven years after the last Change, in which seven Years the Stock and the Companies Affairs dwindled almost to Nothing, until Sir <HI>William Thompson</HI> deceased (a Gentleman of Fa∣mous Prudence and Integrity arrived at that Reputation, that in ef∣fect he Governed the whole affair of the Company until the day of his Death, and under his said Conduct the Companies Affairs did Revive and Prosper, and have since his Death more increased by happy Methods derived from his Wisdom originally: His worthy Son and Posterity are now settled upon Estates in Land and have no concern in the Company.</P>

<HEAD>Whereupon the next Session, <HI>viz. Lunae</HI> 14. <HI>die Novembris</HI> 1692.</HEAD>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> acquaints the House that he had a Message from His Majesty in Answer to the Address of this House the last Sessions, in relation to the <HI>East-India Company,</HI> the which he deli∣vered in Writing at the Table where the same was read — in these Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P><HI>THE</HI> House of Commons <HI>having Presented an</HI> Address <HI>to the</HI> King, <HI>to</HI> Dissolve the Present <HI>East-India</HI> Company, <HI>accord∣ing to the Power reserved in their Charter, and to Constitute a</HI> New One, <HI>His</HI> Majesty <HI>took into Consideration the Proper Methods of complying with their desires, and of Securing effectually this Advan∣tageous Trade to the</HI> Nation.</P>
<P><HI>But His</HI> Majesty <HI>upon Examination of the</HI> Charter, <HI>and consulting His Judges and Learned Council, found that He could not Legally Dissolve the</HI> Company, <HI>but upon Three Years Warning; and that during the three years after warning, the</HI> Company <HI>must subsist and might continue to Trade; and that tho' the</HI> King <HI>might constitute a</HI> New Company, <HI>yet He could not empower such</HI> New Company <HI>to Trade,
<PB REF="10"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till after Three Years: the</HI> Crown having expresly Covenanted, not to Grant any such Liberties.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon His</HI> Majesty <HI>was very apprehensive of the ill consequences of giving warning to the</HI> Company, <HI>because they would be then less solicitous of promoting the true interest and advantage of the Trade, whereof they could not long reap the fruits; and that no</HI> New Com∣pany <HI>could be immediately admitted to it:</HI> So that this very Bene∣ficial Trade, which is already so much impaired, might be in danger of being entirely lost to the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>His</HI> Majesty <HI>being very desirous to prevent so great a mischief, and to gratifie the</HI> House of Commons <HI>in the end, since He could not do it without great hazard in the manner they proposed, required the</HI> East-India <HI>Company to answer directly, whether they would submit to such Regulations as His</HI> Majesty <HI>should judge proper, and most likely to ad∣vance the Trade:</HI> And the <HI>Company</HI> having fully agreed to it, <HI>and declared their Resolution in writing, His</HI> Majesty <HI>commanded a</HI> Com∣mittee <HI>of His</HI> Privy Council <HI>to prepare</HI> Regulations; <HI>which they did, and offered them to the</HI> Company: <HI>But</HI> the <HI>Company,</HI> notwithstanding their Declaration of Submission, rejected almost all the Material Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>So that His</HI> Majesty <HI>finding, That what possibly the</HI> House of Com∣mons <HI>might have expected, and <HI>Indeed was necessary to Pre∣serve this Trade, could not be perfected by His own Autho∣rity alone;</HI> and that the</HI> Company <HI>could not be induced to consent to any such</HI> Regulations; <HI>as might have answered</HI> the Intentions of the House of <HI>Commons; and <HI>That the Concurrence of the Parlia∣ment is requisite to make a complete and useful Settlement of this Trade,</HI> has directed all the Proceedings in this matter to be laid before them, and recommends to them the preparing of such a Bill, in order to pass into an Act of</HI> Parliament, <HI>as may establish this Trade on such Foundations as are most likely to preserve and advance it.</HI></P></Q>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>Upon this Message, the Honourable <HI>House of Commons</HI> took into Consideration the Settlement of the said Trade; but finding the same Obstructed by the then Companies great Opposition, toward the End of the Session, <HI>Viz.
