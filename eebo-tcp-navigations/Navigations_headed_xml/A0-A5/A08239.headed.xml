For what is more discom∣mendable, what more vnbeseeming a man that is studious, spe∣cially being nobly borne, than alwaies to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide at home like a snaile in the shel, to waxe olde in vayne pleasure without praise,
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
and vnnecessary leysure, without profit, and not to meditate &amp; thinke that at one time or other it is meete to hoouer with the winges, to leaue the nest, and to flie abroade, that they may aspire to the knowledge, and attaine to the sight of great mat∣ters, wherwith they shal neuer be acquainted, otherwise than by the booke or the map, which differ as much in mouing the imagination and other faculties of the mind, as the represen∣tation of a thing in a glasse or a paynted table, doth vary from the thing represented? To vndertake trauelling, the vtilitye (which is not small) springing from thence, shoulde inuyte all liberall mindes and free natures. And in truth none are so muche adorned and benefited by peregrination as Noble and Great men; though doubtlesse it is not deniable, that common men, (I meane not triobular mates) men I say, of base descent and linage, haue thereby not only bin commended to the Ho∣norable; but also their owne experience and triall of occur∣rents in trauelling, doth procure thus much more than ordi∣nary vnto them, that they are among men vntrauelled as Hes∣perus among the smaller starres. For when wee eyther heare or reade of fruitefull countries, of well gouerned common∣wealthes, of true religion and diuine worship, of learned men, of trayning vp youth, of manners and behauiours &amp;c: is it not sweete in euery ones eare, is it not woorth the vnderstanding, doth it not deserue diligent marking and remembring? But yet much more pleasaunt, and profitable is it to view the very things them selues, to behold them, and to see them with satie∣tie, as the Poet very aptly saith:
<Q><L>That which we heare with outwarde eare,</L>
<L>moues not the minde so much,</L>
<L>As that which beames of rowling eyes,</L>
<L>atteine vnto and touch.</L></Q></P>
<P>A certaine Traueller, but (as maye bee suspected by the course of his writing) superstitious, according to his time, spea∣king of a voyage of his owne, saith thus: Shoulde it grieue or repent me of my peregrination to Rome, specially in the yeare of Iubile? No in truth. For such thinges as were doubtfull to
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
me, before vncertaine, &amp; as a shadow, are now, by the infallible testimonie of mine eies assured vnto me with singular credite, and haue raised vp in me an exceeding delectation &amp; astonish∣ment. They therfore at no hand deserue the hearing, which be∣ing induced by an argument drawen from the greatnesse of the labors, &amp; the dangerousnes of circumstances incident vnto tra∣uelling, suppose that the same is to be laide a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eepe, to be omit∣ted, &amp; not medled with at all. But what (think we) may be obie∣cted against those shelsnailes? This truly, that people are borne to paynes taking, as birdes to flying. Aristotle in his Ethicks re∣quiring a capable hearer of his morall preceptes, reiecteth infantes and olde men as insufficient: which two degrees of age do seeme (in some mens thinking) vnfit for trauelling: be∣cause the one, by reason of their multiplied yeeres; are to be released from the tediousnesse thereof; the other also, in re∣spect of want in iudgement, vnderstanding and strength, are wholly to be sequestred from it. But I do much mislike their o∣pinion, and the reasons likewise thereto ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed. For though infantes are vnfit for peregrination, yet to exclude olde men, as vnapt, is (in my poore cōceipt) palpable erron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous. For in a mat∣ter nothing doubtfull to vse needlesse proofe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as Tullie neatly saith) we haue an example of Iacob, an old man, &amp; ful of yeres, who notwithstanding trauelled out of his own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> countrey into Aegypt, partly by constraint of famine, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artly also for hys sonne Iosephs sake, whom naturally he loued▪ Agayne, if olde men are condemned as vnfit for peregrination, then truely (by the same comparison) women much more whom the same Ari∣stotle tearmeth vnperfect creatures. But the Queene of the South, hearing of Solomons wisedome, glory, and mightinesse left the territories of her owne dominions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o see him wyth her eyes, whose incomparable renowme had amazed her hearte. So then by these instaunces the former reason see∣meth too halte, and the Authour thereof to haue saide some∣what▪ but yet with little aduisement and to small purpose.
I might adde to these Hagiographicall examples, other t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sti∣monies deduced and brought out of prophane Chronologies,
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
both auncient and moderne; were it not that I feare the cen∣sure of some politike Hanniball, and incurre deserued blame for talking fondly of a thing wherein I haue no practise, as som∣times did foolified Phormio. Onely this I say, that the greatest commendation and praise of a traueller is, not onelye to talke by knowledge roundly of such famous Cities, Countries, peo∣ple, and other straunge obiectes as he hath seene; but also to speake their language redily, to learne their manners desirous∣ly, to know their religion perfectly, their pollicie throughly, their gouernment absolutely, and all thinges els, that hee may imploy himselfe about profitably; as it is recorded of Vlisses▪ whom Ascham out of Homer commendeth in these words:
<Q><L>All trauellers doe gladly report great praise of Vlisses,</L>
<L>For that he knew many mens manners, and saw many cities.</L></Q></P>
<P>And as histories beare witnesse of Mithridates the King of Pontus, whose peregrinations and expeditions into forreyne landes was so beneficiall, that (besides a number of vnnamed commoditities) he had the exquisite vse of two and twenty sun∣dry tongues. But nowe (Right honorable and Noble) to stop this flowing streame of wordes, I leaue to the leuell of your ex∣act considerations the manifold vtilities of peregrination, be∣cause you are completely furnished with knowledge and expe∣rience in that behalfe, not seuered, but vnited. Beseeching you to accept at my handes, with no lesse fauour and well liking, than is presented with hearty goodwill and honest meaning, a work extant in French, published in Duitch, &amp; now printed in English at my costes &amp; charges for the general profite &amp; plea∣sure of the studious, and al such as delight in nouelties.

do call her Alger: howbeit, she is situated vpō the Mediterane Sea, vpon the hanging of a mountaine euuironed with strong walles, ramperdes, ditches, platformes and bulwarks, in forme almost threesquare, the largenesse which goeth towardes the Sea side, stretcheth narrowly almost vntoo the highest parte: where as ther is a great building made in forme of a Citadelle to commaund the towne and entrie of the heauen. As for the buildings being beyond the pallace royall, are very fayre hou∣ses belonging too particular men, with a greate number of bathes and Cookes houses The places and streetes are so well ordeined, y<SUP>t</SUP> euery one in his occupatiō apart: there are about three thousand hearthsteedes. At the bottom of the citie whi∣che is towards the North ioynyng too the walles whiche are beaten with the surges of the Sea in a great place, is by great artifice and subtill architecture builded, theyr principall &amp; head Mosquee, and a little below that, is the Arcenal, whiche is the place into which are hayled vppe and trymmed the gal∣lies and other vessels. This citie is very merchantlike, for that she is situated vpon the Sea, and for this cause marueylouslye peopled, for her bignesse: she is inhabited of Turkes, Moores, and Iewes in great number, which with marueilous gaine ex∣ercise the trade of merchandise, and lend out money at vsury.

But it came to passe that whylest Albuhenan king of Fez, made warre with Abulhabbes king of Thunes (whom he took prisoner) the Ge∣neuois with an armie of twentie shippes, tooke it, pilled it, and carryed away the most part of the inhabitauntes prisoners, of which taking the king of Fez being aduertised, sent in diligēce to compounde with them for the deliuerance of the citie and prisoners, for the sum of fiftie thousand crownes, which were deliuered vnto them in readie money: but after the giuing o∣uer and their departure, they founde the one halfe of the mo∣ney to be counterfeated.

<P>HAuing wel considered the placing of the campe, the town and castle, we returned to the Bascha, with whom the Am∣bassadour talked a while, and in the meane while I went to see the market of the Turks (which they call Basar) being hard by where the poore Christians of Sicil, Malta, &amp; Gose, were sold vnto those that most offered for them &amp; last inhaunsers, being permitted vnto those that bought them (as the auncient cu∣stome of the Orientall Barbarians is) to stripp them starke na∣ked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maner to serch the christian slaues that come to bee sold.</NOTE> &amp; to make thē goe, to the intent to see if they haue any na¦turall impediment in their bodies, visiting afterwards theyr teeth and eyes, as though they had been horses, and standing there, I saw creeping vpon the ground a Scorpion of yealowe coloure, being of length more then a long finger.

readie to the battry, did the next day folowing beyng y<SUP>e</SUP> eight of August, begin to shoote at the castle with great furie, which was not leaft vnanswered, &amp; euery houre some slaine: whilest this was a doing the Bascha sent to pray the Ambassa∣dor that he wold suffer none of his mē to com a land, least the Turks might do them some outrage in mistaking them to bee of those of the castle. This battery cōtinued vntill about noon, but not without receiuing great damage of the besieged, who without ceassing shot into the trēches, so as that day they slue foure of the best gunners of the armie, two Chiaous, &amp; certain Raiz of the Gallie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raiz are cap∣taines of the gallies.</NOTE> they also shot off the hand of the clarke ge∣nerall of the armie, being a man of great estimation &amp; greatly beloued of the Bascha, and to be short there were a great num∣ber of Ianissaries slayne and hurt. Moreouer they burst one of their best peeces, and dismounted foure other, which for that day made them to leaue of the battery, which they of the Ca∣stle did not, but shot without ceasing to endamage the enemy: the night following the Turkes approched more neare vntoo the castle, vpon whom they of the Castle about the breake of day, gaue an assault euen to their trenches: and being retyred, the Turkes (at the Sun rysing, which they haue in great reue∣rence) renued their batterie with great force and 8. peeces at once: vpō the euening the fire by mischāce got into their pon¦der, with the which were burnt 30.

The Ambassadour on the other part, sued with great instance for licence too prosecute on his iourney, which was graunted vnto him, but as wee were vpō our depar∣ture, the Bascha (being almost mad) sent to him by an Eunuch his Dragoman, that he would stay 2. dayes longer, within whi∣che time he hoped to win the castle.

And thus being placed they had so well continued the batterie, that they had beaten it downe euen to the very edge of the ditch: but that whiche was beaten downe in the day time, the assieged made vp againe in the night: notwithstanding the end was such that an vnhappie souldier of Prouence, borne in Cauaillon, being the Popes countrie, which by the long frequentation he hadde had in those countries, had learned the language and serued as a spie vnto the enemie, seeyng the occasion to be come to that passe, which his knauery and dissimuled treason hadde wished for, and being corrupted with money, found the menes to fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vnto the campe, where he declared vnto the Turkes the wea∣kest places of the castle, by the which it might be battered and soone taken, &amp; it was against the gouernours lodging, which standing towards the ditch, and hauing vnderneath it the cel∣lars to retyre the munition, could not be repayred nor fortifi∣ed: which the Bascha hauing vnderstanded, caused the battery there to be planted, laying the peeces so lowe that easily they dyd beat the vautes and cellars in suche sorte as in small time they did pearse the walles, wherupon folowed that the height being charged with rampardes through the cōtinuall battery beganne greatly too sinke, which amased the souldiers for that

they knew no means to repayr the same, that setting al honor aside, quyting thēselues of their weapōs, cōcluded together to take some party, giuing their captayne to vnderstande that hauing vnto that instant quited themselues as good men and valiaunt souldyers, seeing theyr matters too be in despaire of succour, and not able to holde out any longer: he would not thynke euill of them, if they thought to practise some way for theyr suretie. Whereof the Gouernour called Vallier a knight of Daulphine beying aduertised, and by Argosin a Spanyshe souldier one of the eldest and most authorised, solicited, to come too a composition wyth the enemie, before the walles were further endamaged, was greatly dismayed: which seeing a sage and valiaunt knyght of Fraunce, named Poisieu, as the most auncient, in the name of the other knightes, declared vnto them, that the breache was not so great nor profitable for the enemie, but that it was defenceable too suche as would diligently repayre the same: And moreouer that it was more honourable to knights of honour and lustie souldiers, to die valiauntly, fighting against the Barbaries for the maintenance of the lawe and true Christian religion, then so fainte hearted∣lie to surrender themselues to the mercie of those, at whose hands was nothing to be looked for, but miserable seruitude, and all kinde of crueltie. But rather to preuent these dāgers, it were necessarie too refresh the xxx. knightes which were there offering himselfe to sustayne the assaulte, and to succour the first that hee should see wearie or hurt: and therefore ex∣horted the Gouernour to fight as long as hee coulde. Not∣withstanding all these his remonstrances were of no effect, be∣cause the Gouernour was without ceassing solicited vnto and as it were constrained by Argosin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Importunitie of the Argosin</NOTE> &amp; other of his partie to sur∣render: which with vehemencie declared vnto him the emi∣nent daunger, they and so many women and young children were in: findyng hymself bereafte of hearte and fortune: and forsaken of his souldiers, wythout further consideration con∣sented, that a whyte banner should be erected vpon the walles too call the enemies too a Parle. And a Turke presenting hym selfe, they prayed him that he would vnderstande of the Bas∣cha,
<PB REF="27" MS="y"/>
if he wolde receiue certaine of them to treat of some good accord touching the giuing ouer of the castle, whereunto the Bascha lightly consenting, was in all diligence dispatched a braue Spaniard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cōditions pro¦poned by the assieged.</NOTE> named Guiuare, and a knight of Maiorque to offer vnto the Bascha the castle with the Artillerie and muniti∣on, so as he would furnish them of shippes to bring them with bag &amp; baggage safely to Malta: to whō summarily was answea∣red, that (forasmuchas, as yet they had not deserued any grace presuming to be so bold as to keep so small a place against the armie of the highest Prince on the earth) yf they woulde paye the whole charges of the armie, he would gladly agree to the matter proponed, or if they would not thereunto consent (as it became them) that for theyr recompence, all they within the Castle should continue slaues and prisoners: notwithstan∣dyng if they incontinently and without delay, did surrender the place he would exempt out of them two hundreth. Wher∣uppon the messengers returning in despayre of anye further grace, were stayed by Drogot and Salaraiz wyth flatteryng woordes, and fayned promises, that they woulde endeuour so much as in any wise lay in them, too make the Bascha condis∣cend to a better and more gracious composition: for they fea∣red that the assieged through despayre would resolue (as their extreeme refuge) to defend themselues euen too the last man. And incontinent went to the Bascha, to declare vnto him hys ouersight, in refusing those which of theyr owne voluntarie came to surrender themselues into his hands, and that too put thē out of dout and despayre, he ought with all mildnesse to a∣gree vnto all that they demaunded.

The day before there died also two gallie slaues and foure in the pa∣trone: all whiche were cast into the sea to feede fishes. Vppon the Sunday beeyng the 23. approching neere vnto Malta: wee sent the frigate on before along the coast of Gosse to discouer whither the sea were cleere of gallies, galliots and other vessels of the enemies. For we something doubted the gallies of Ge∣nua, after hauing long looked for their returne discouering thē a far off, they gaue vs a signe that there was no dāger towards: &amp; so sayling betwixt Goze &amp; the yle of Malta: we arriued there very late: &amp; the entrance of the hauen being shut, the Ambas∣sador sent his Lieuetenaunt with his skiffe towardes the grand maister to signifie vnto him our ariual, &amp; to desire him to cause the hauen to be opened for vs, and too giue him also to vnder∣stand,

that he had within his gallies the Gouernour and other knights of Tripoli. But he vnderstanding of the taking of Try∣poli was in such a rage and anger, that he sent word back again that he would do nothing vntil the morning, that he shuld haue all his counsel together, to vnderstand of them what were too be done, and afterwardes would let him vnderstande his plea∣sure. The knight Parisot sent foorthwyth certayne refreshinges of bread, wine, and sweet water: which were accepted in better parte then the answeare of the grand maister: Vaillier &amp; other knights went to lye within the Bourge. The next daye in the morning the hauen was opened, into which we entred without any welcome bidden. And neuerthelesse the grand maister sent Parisot and certaine other auncient knights to receiue the Am∣bassador, who greatly disdayned at the message that in the eue∣ning before was sent vnto him, which the knights would fayne haue cloaked and excused, but could not with honesty doe it: being come to the castle, he was receiued of the grandmayster with smal countenance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingratitude of the grand mai∣ster.</NOTE> as a recompence for that he had at hys great charges and costs, besides the losse of his men that were dead and diseased, safely brought away the knightes and soul∣diers from Tripoli, who if it had not byn for hym and his gifts had all remayned as Slaues to the Turkes: wherein the grande maister could not be perswaded, which against al right &amp; truth mainteined his opinion, that without the good willes of the knights, they would neuer haue Surrendred. And as for the 30. Turkes being slaues, which Vaillier (vppon caution &amp; assu∣raunce of the Ambassadour) had promised too bee redeliuered vnto the Bascha, he would by no meanes thereuntoo consent. The counsell of the religion were three times assembled, where the ambassadour by good reasons spared not to reprooue the false opinion of the grand maister, from the which he was by no manner of remonstrances to be perswaded. But to the contra∣ry maliciously suborned the spanish and Italian knight agaynst vs, so farre that some sayde wee were come to Malta to espye and view the place, &amp; to cause it to be brought vnder the Iuris∣diction of the Turks: other said that after we had caused Tripo∣li to be lost, we would returne againe to the army.

But as my guide told me, certaine yeeres before the head had been taken away by Proueditor of the Ile, whiche had caused the same to be conueighed to Venice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sta∣ture and effig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Helene.</NOTE> and the Iso∣lands doe affirme that it was the effige of Helene, which Iohn de Maire of Belges in his illustrations of Gaule, doth approue saying, that it was there, where Paris after he had rauished He∣lene, tooke of her the first frutes of his loue. A little below this temple vpon the same mountaine, was the castle of Mena∣laus, the husband of Helene, which was king of Sparta, &amp; lord of this Ile. The foundations of which Castle, are there as yet apparant by the residue of the walles which are made of gra∣uen stone without morter or playster, of length and bignesse vnmeasurable, then was also an high tower fouresquare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foundations of the castle of Menalaus.</NOTE> from the which in faire and cleare weather may be seene, not onely the citie of Sparthe, but also the most part of Penelopese (now called Morea.)

<P>THE yle of Chio or Scio, by Ephore first called Ethalie, of Metrodore Chia, of the nymph of Chione, and as others say, Macrin or Pithiosa, lyeth in the sea Ionique specting East∣wardes by the distance of tenne miles. Eolide, a countrie in A∣sia the lesser by Ptolome Argenum Promontorium, and of the moderne maryner Capo Bianco, or as Plinie writeth, Mysie: she is cituated betweene the Iles of Samos and Lesbos, about the height of Erithase.

To the northwards she is distāt frō the yle of Lesbos now called Metelin, 50. miles, &amp; from Delos now called Sdile (where sometimes was the fa∣mous temple and oracle of Apollo) between the south and the North 90. miles, from Lango, betweene the north the south 80. miles, and from Psara by Strabo Psira to the west 15. miles. This yle is diuided into 2. parts: to wit, by height and lownesse, the height towards the south is high and hilly, ful of great woods, darke vallies and riuers, which issuing into the sea, cause many myls to grind. There are also diuers castles, some on the moun∣taynes, and some on the playne which is very fertile, and a∣boundeth of al things necessary. On the end of the yle towards the West is the mount of S.

But Pliny contrarying them, saith that his sepulture is in the yle Ios, which likewise was called Phenice, &amp; presently Nio. The said Insulanes do further say, that the said Homer was born in a village not farre from thence called to this houre Ho∣mero, wheras grow the best &amp; most excellēt wines of al Graecia, which the auncients in their bankets &amp; feastings did greatly e∣steem as Pliny reciteth, saying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book 14.

The order to pull and gather the Mastick from the trees is this. About the beginning of the monethes of Iuly and Au∣gust, the husband men with a pointed Iron doe rent and cut the barke of the trees in diuers places, and out of these incisi∣ons and cuttes proceedeth the Masticke by droppes as it were Gum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maner of gatheryng of mastick.</NOTE> which they gather in the moneth of September follow∣ing, &amp; after do deliuer the same vnto the Segniorie, as before is saide, This done, the Lordes do part the same, and put it to the handeling and administration of foure of them: the one of which hath the charge too furnishe all Grecia: the other, the whole West partes, which is Italie, Fraunce, Spaine, and Ger∣manie: the third distributeth his part throughout little Asia, which verily is Turkie: and the fourth, furnisheth Suria, Egypt and Barbarie. Moreouer the said foure Lords haue vnder them Commities, which do distribute the masticke throughout all the principall towns beyng vnder theyr charge.

This Citie is cituated vppon the sea ten miles below the port Delphin hauing his aspecte oriental toward Asia the lesse: the hauen is very good &amp; able to hold a great many vessels, &amp; the towne is inuironed with good walles, large rampards, &amp; deep ditches: Vpon one of the sides of the common place where the market for victuals is kept, is the burse, wheras the Merchants do euery day assemble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Burse where the mer¦chants doc as∣semble.</NOTE> as they do at the Chaunge of Lions and burse of Antwerp, &amp; royal exchange of Londō, for the traffick &amp; handeling of their merchandises: &amp; on the other side, on the left hand, is the pallace where the Segniorie keep their coūsels for the affayres of the Ile &amp; the Citie. The streetes are faire and large, &amp; the houses &amp; churches, builded after the maner of Ge∣nua and Italie, without the walles are fayre suburbes full of gardens, pleasant and delectable, filled with diuers frutes of marueilous sweetnes: as orenges, lēmons, citrons figs peares, apples, prunes, abricors, dates &amp; oliues, and likewise of all sorts of hearbes, sweet flowers, good and wholesome waters both of wels and fountaines.

About the time that the figs begynne to waxe ripe, they teare certaine braunches of the figge tree that is nought, and caste the same vpon the other that is good, or els doe fasten by the stake certaine quantitie of the yll figges, after they haue firste picked them, out of which prickes do ingender and breed cer¦taine small flying wormes, which with their billes and stinges picking the other figs, sodaynely after they are picked, they come to a good and perfect rypenesse, and as I was informed they haue of those fig trees, a great quantitie in that Iland. The second thing worthie of memorie is, that in certain Casales or villages of that Ile, are seene an inestimable number of great red partriges, as tame as though they wer chickins or hens of this country which the countrie folks do feed by great flocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tame partri∣ges which are led &amp; brought to and fro the fieldes.</NOTE> driuing them in the daye time too goe grase in the moun∣taynes, and towards the euening the boyes or girles, which do keep them, do cal them together with a whistle or some song: and these Partriges being accustomed to such calles, inconti∣nently euery flock (which somtimes are two or three hundred more or lesse) gather to their conductor, which bringeth them home to their village &amp; dwelling as though they were hennes or tame geese: they go also a feeding in small flockes alongest the streets of the citie &amp; within priuate houses, but being cari¦ed out of this Ile, they become wild, forgetting their tamenes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A tribute whi∣che the wid∣dowes of Chio that wil not marry must pay</NOTE> They of Chio (as diuers inhabitants worthie of credit haue en∣formed me) obserue a custom vsed of antiquity, that if a womā after the discease of her husbād, wil remain a widow with pre∣tēce neuer to marry again: the Segniorie cōstraineth her to pay a certain peece of mony, which they cal Argomoniatico, y<SUP>t</SUP> is to

This Ile (as writeth Ptolome) extendeth from the South to the North in distaunce threescore myles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In his descrip∣tio of Asia the lesse. chap. 74.</NOTE> counting from the Citie of manlee ioyning to the Promontorie Sigrie, vnto the cape Lesbos aunciently called the promontorie of Sytrie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape of Les∣bos.</NOTE> Notwith¦standing that the modernes founded on a contrarie opinion and ocular reason, affirme the length thereof to bee from the West too the East 110. miles, and the whole circuite 160.

But Seruie calleth it Methine, howsoeuer it be, Stra∣bo spake aright, where he sayeth it to haue two great ports, the one, on the direct South, able to hold aboue fiftie gallies and many other vessels. The other, being great, sure, and deepe, ha∣uing at the entrie thereof a small Iland, but where he sayth the second to lye on the North part, he may by the view &amp; eisight onely be reproued, being in deed towards the East.

which giueth an appearance that it hath in times past bin some renowmed city. This place aboundeth of fayre and fruitful gar∣dens, and is a great countrey of vines producing great aboun∣dance of good wines, which they preserue in great earthen pit∣chers, which they bury in the ground, to the intent too keepe the same the longer good. They haue also aboundance of pa∣stures and good waters both of wels &amp; fountaines: al along the sea side are seen 36. windmilles, hauing euery one of them 10. wings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVindemilles with x. wings.</NOTE> and also there are diuers of them about the castle of A∣byde. The next day in the morning as we were lading of wines which we took in for our gallies, there came a complaint vnto the Ambassadour of two Graecian marriners of the Patronne: which the day before had stollen two gownes from one of the Inhabitants of that place. Of which the one being taken hadde presently three stroppados at the yardes arme of the gally: but the other being better aduised and swifter of his feet escaped. After dinner we departed from this place, and hauing a fore∣winde, sayling along by Graecia, we passed the castle of widdows lying vpon the sea coast three myles from Mayton: wherof no∣thing is seene but the ruines, vnder which lieth a vallie very fer∣tile of al things.

The wind being verye good for vs we continued our voyage a∣long the costs of Thracia towards Propontide, passing by Ma∣crotique,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macrotique.</NOTE> which otherwise is called Longus murus, afterwardes Byzante nowe Rodesto, or Rodosto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Byzante or Rodesto.</NOTE> beeing vppon the middest of a gulph, (hauing 30. myles in bredth) leauing the yles Proco∣nese of the moderns called Mormora, &amp; the Besbiques at thys day called Calanio on our right hand, and from thence passed towards the city of Perinthe vulgarly called Heraclee, which as the foundations do shew hath in times past bin very great.

The rest of the promontory is ful of ruines vnhabited ex∣cept that which is in the streight: and whereas now the Towne standeth which towardes the sea side is not walled, wee rested there one nighte, but neuerthelesse came not a lande. And in the morninge in the dawning of the daye beeyng with rowing gotten out of the porte, wee founde a fresh wind, which sayling brought vs before the goulph of Selimbrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goulph Se∣limbrie.</NOTE> which the modernes call Seliuree, beyng an auncient city.

in such sort that in the time of the Christian Emperors it might iustly haue been called the most perfect, most rich, and most sumptuous temple, not onely of the parties orientall, but likewise of the whole world.

<P>IN Constantinople as also in all the other cities Mahematised in Graecia, Asia, &amp; Africa are a great nūber of very faire baths, aswell publike as priuate:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bathes publik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and priuate.</NOTE> which according to the imitation of the auncient Graecians &amp; Romaines, are constructed &amp; builded with industry, sumptuousnesse, &amp; expenses almost incredible: &amp; aboue al others those of the Sarails of the great Turke, his wo∣men &amp; his Baschas: yea euen the moste parte of the common bathes are beautified and set out with pillers in crustures tables and pauements of diuers marbers rare in colour and beautye. These bathes are builded after this maner, that there are 2. prin∣cipal great bodies of building round &amp; strongly set vp vawtwise in form of the Hemispherike: &amp; the first wherin they doe enter, which by the anciēts hath bin called Apoditayre hath in one of the corners therof a furnace like vnto the hotte houses of Ger∣manye seruing too drye the shyrtes and other linnē, which do come thither to bath: &amp; in the midst is a faire fountain of Mar∣ber, either of a natural spring or artificial, and round about the walles are diuers seueral seats, made the one a little from the o∣other, couered with tapistry of Turkie, vppon the whiche they

vncloth themselues, leauing their garments in sure keeping of the Capsaire: and such as will bath themselues after they haue couered their priuie members, with a great blew linnen cloth which is giuen vnto them, doe first goe in to the Tepidarie too make themselues sweate, and from thence they enter into ano∣ther great place of the bath beyng more higher, &amp; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeling thereof made cleare wyth diuers windowes, too the intent too shew the brighter: in the middest whereof is also a fountaine most magnificque casting foorth water abundantly, and euen hard by the same is a table of fine Marber, set vpon foure round bowles, vpon the (which after they haue wel sweated and haue wel bathed themselues in a great vessell of Marber of Porphyre which standeth readie at hand) the seruants which there are in greate number, require you to lay your selfe along flat vppon your bellie, &amp; then one of these great lubbers after they haue well pulled and stretched your armes aswell before as behinde in such sort that he wyll make your bones too cracke, and well rubbed the sooles of your feete, mounteth vpon your backe, and so with his feet slydeth vp and downe vpon you, and vpon your raynes, as if he woulde brouse them in peeces, and then againe maketh you to turne on your backe, pulling and remo∣uing your ioyntes as before is said, and neuerthelesse without doing vnto you any harme at all, but to the contrarie doth so comfort your sinewes and strengtheneth your members, that yee shalbe after it a great deale more fresh, liuely &amp; better dis∣posed: and being thus dressed, ye enter into a little chamber, temperately whoat, where againe this great fellowe commeth too rubbe you: and after that hee hath well soaped and rub∣bed your bodie and your members wyth a purse of Stammin, or Chamblet, which hee holdeth in his hande in manner of a gloue (in steede of the Strigil which the Romans vsed) he wa∣sheth you with very cleare water spryng out of 2. conduits or fountaynes, the one being whot and other colde, both which doe fall into a basen of Marber, within the whiche hee tempe∣reth it, pouryng out the same wyth a fayre basen of Cop∣per damasked, and also with a pounced stone hee rubbeth and cleanseth the plantes of your feete, and then cutteth

your beard and the holes vnderneath your arme pittes. But as touching the priuy members, they giue you a rasour, or rather a Psilothre (whiche they doe call Rusma) whiche is a paste whiche beeyng layde vppon the hearye places doeth foorth∣with cause the haires to fall out. And of this paste the Turkes both men and women do often vse for that they do abhorre to weare haire in those places: and after ye haue in this order swea¦ted and haue byn pulled, stretched, rubbed, scratched, and wa∣shed, you do returne to the place where your clothes are for to dry, and make you ready againe: and after yee haue giuen cer∣tain Aspres in reward to the seruants, &amp; 2▪ or 3. Aspres vnto the Capsayry (which sitteth at the entry of the gate to receiue of those that come thither to bathe) ye may go whither it pleaseth you. Now is to be noted that al nations of what faith or religiō soeuer they be, are al alike and indifferently receiued &amp; intrea∣ted for their money in these bathes. But aboue all other the Turks, Moors, and generally al the Mehemetised frequent thi∣ther most oftē aswel for their volupt pleasure as bodily health.

<P>THe Turks wiues by ordinary custome &amp; auncient obserua∣tion, which they do reserue of the old custome of Asia and Graecia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do delight at al times to haunt the bathes, aswel for the continuaunce of their health, as beautifiyng of their persons which is not to be reputed as spoken of the women of base e∣state or cōditiō, but likewise of the great and notable dames, which ordinarily doe frequent the bathes 2. or 3. times in the weeke, not the publike but their priuate bathes, which for the most part they haue very fair within their houses or Sarails, but such as are of the meaner degree goe vnto thē at the least once in the weeke, if by other they will bee esteemed not infamed or scarce honest.

And therfore cōsidering the reasons aforesaid, to wit, the clensing of their bodies, health, superstitiō, liberty to go abroad, &amp; lasciuious voluptuousnes, it is not to be maruelled at that these baths are so accustomably frequēted of the Turks, &amp; that likewise the womē of estate do so gladly go thither in the morning betimes for to remain there vntil dinner time, beyng accompanied with 1. or 2. slaues, the one bearing on her head a vessel of brasse made after the fashiō of a smal bucket to draw water with, and within the same is a fine &amp; long smock of cot∣ton tissed, besides another smock, breeches, &amp; other like linnen

with a drugge called Rusma, which being putuerised and tem∣pered in water, they rubbe vppon all the partes of the bodye where they will haue the haires too go of, which incontinently with the sweat doe fall of. This vessel thus garnished is born be∣ing couered with a rich pauillion of veluet or crimson satten set with gold and siluer, and hanged with tassels of silke and gold. The other slaue (if ther be two of them) carrieth a fine couerlet with a faire pillow beere: and in such order the slaues do go be∣hynd their mistresses, which vnder their gownes are cloathed with a fine linnen smock by them called Barami. Nowe beyng come to the place of bathing, the couerlet is spread abrode, v∣pon the which they vncloth them selues and lay downe their garments and iewels: for their preparation and order is suche, that going to the bathes whither they be Turks, or Christians, the better to be liked the one of the other, they set forth them selues with their richest apparrell, and most precious tablets: and being thus vncloathed vppon the carpet, they turne the vessell wyth the mouth downewardes, and the bottome vp∣wards for to sit the more easily, and then the slaues the one of the one side, and the other on the other side, doe wash and rubbe the bodye vntyll it doe suffyce: and then doe goe to re∣pose them selues in a small chamber being indifferently hot. In which meane space, and during this repast, the slaues doe washe one another. And after they haue thus remayned in the bathes and whot chambers so long as it doth please them, the slaues doe agayne lay vppe the smockes and other linnen into the vessel, and so following theyr maistresse doe returne home∣wards, as ye may perceiue by the picture following: after that she hath paid vnto the mistres of the bath such summe as the men do pay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vsage of the baths hath byn anciently obserued of the Scithes.</NOTE> &amp; as before I haue recited.

The depth therof is such, that there is no ships or Galliōs of what bignesse soeuer they be, which cā∣not ankor on both sides euen to the very houses sides. This ci∣tie of Pera is builded partlye on the middest and partly on the hanging of an hyll,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of Pera.</NOTE> beeing in compasse little lesse then three myles and is separated by walles in three partes, within one of the which do dwell the right Peratins, in the other the Greci∣ans, and in the third the Turks, which haue the whole gouern∣ment thereof, and a certaine of Iewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pera inhabited by three sun∣dry nations.</NOTE> for that the most part of the Iewes doe dwell in Constantinople. The proportion therof is in a maner confused, for that she is broade in the middest &amp; lowest partes, and long at the further ende. Shee is verye well beset with houses, which neuerthelesse are neither greatly fair, &amp; lesse cōmodious, notwithstānding there are diuers tayre foū∣taines, led through pypes out of the riuer Danube, and other floods neerer vnto thē.

The Frēch∣men and true Peratines doe liue according to the lawes of the Romish Church, which differeth much from the religion of the Graecians, which is the occasion that they doe not greatly loue one another, for the diuersity of their faith▪ wherby it commeth to passe that if a Greek do marry with a Perotte, Francke, or a Graecian woman with a Perot Franco, euery one of them do liue according to their religion and do therfore not agree very wel together.

Their order was first instituted by Amurat the 2. of that name and 7. Emperor of the Turks:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of the Ianissaries instituted by Amarat the 7.

For by their helpe Amurat and such as haue holden the Empire after him, haue gotten &amp; ouercome diuers battels: and ouercome all the East partes, without that euer it hath byn proued that in any day of battel those Ianissaries haue bin ouercome. The order of which is nothing els then the fol∣lowing of the Macedonian Phalangue with the which Alexan∣der the great extended his domination and monarchy almoste vpon all the regions of the earth, and seemeth that the Turkes occupiers of his empire are also imitators of the warlike disci∣pline of the old kinges of Macedonie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armure of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Macedonians.</NOTE> although the difference of their weapons is most euident, for that the Macedonians co∣uering their heads with sallettes, and their bodies with curates carryed long pykes with shields or bucklers of yron cast vppon their backs, to the intent promptly to take the same agayne, &amp; to couer themselues therwith when it shuld come to fight hand to hand with swords.

handle very wel: the other do carry half pykes. And to the in∣tent they should seem the more cruel &amp; furious in the aspect of their faces, they do not suffer their beards too grow but aboue the lips, &amp; let their mustaches grow very long, grosse &amp; thicke: &amp; the rest of the haires of their beards they doe cut away with the rasor, as also those of their head, except a tuffe of haire on the top of their head, to leaue some hold to take vp their heads being stricken off by the enimy, if it shuld chance them to be o∣uercome, so as by such defiguration they do shew very horrible, hideous, &amp; feareful, no lesse then in times past was the cruel Ca∣ligula, as the histories do witnes of him. They are clothed twise in the yeere with course blew cloth, as the Azamoglans are, and on their heads of a peculiar prerogatiue, in steede of a sallet or morlion, they weare a hood of fine white felt, whiche they call Zarcola, set out in the forefront with a garlande of fine drawen gold, with a socket of siluer &amp; guilt, set vp right in the fore part, enritched with rubies, turquesies, and other fine stones of small price, within the top of which socket they set such plumes of fea¦thers, as they do weare. And yet this is not permitted vnto eue∣ry one of them, but only to those who in the warres haue done some notable feate in their person. Their order vniuersall is distributed in tenths, hundreths, and thousands: euery tenne of these Ianissaries going to the warres haue a pauillion or tent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distribution of the order of the Ianissa∣ries.</NOTE> &amp; a tenth person in their language called Oda Bassi, which distri∣buteth and parteth amongst them the offices of the chamber, as to the one to cut the wood, the other to dresse vp the pauilli∣on, and the other to make ready their meate, an other to keepe the ward, and so consequently al the rest: and by this order of equality, they liue together as in a fraternity, quietnes and in∣credible concord.

Lackies being Persians, called in their language Peicz or Peiclars, euery one hauing eight or ten Aspres by the day, and twise in the yeare new clothed with garmentes of sattin or damaske, figured of diuers colours, vpon their heads they do weare a high Bonnet of fine siluer gilted, called in their lan∣guage Scuff, set round about with diuers stones, whereof some are fine and some false, and in the toppe a great and high tufte of Eastrige fearhers, set out with many diuers &amp; rare small fea∣thers of byrdes. About their bodie they are girded with a large girdle of Tissue, or of silke and golde, called Cochiach, beeing verie fayre and of great value, and of such length that it goeth three times about the hodie, &amp; ouerthwart the same, do weare a braue dagger by them called Biciach set with Iuorie or bones of fishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sugar candie good for fain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦nes.</NOTE> carrying in one of their handes an Anagiach being a small hatchet, and in the other a handkercher full of Suger Cā∣die, which in running they do eate, aswell for their sustenance and strength, as to take away the faintnes.

<P>IN times past, and in the dayes of other Emperors of Turkie, the Peicz, whom we call lackies, haue varyed much in their apparrell, custome, and maners, from those which are nowe a∣dayes, for as some haue written, they following the example and antiquitie of the Grecians and Asians, trauailed and ranne barefooted without any shoes, or any other thing on their feet sauing that the soles of their feete were shod like vnto horses, the skin vnder the plant of their feet being so hard that easily they could forbeare the nailes &amp; irons being but light▪ being a matter so hard that at the first I coulde scarcely beleeue it, for that amongest al the Peicz,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient Peiz wer shod like horse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> I had not seene one after that sort, but hauing curiously enquired of the very same partie by whom the liuely figure before set out was made, hee did assure me the same to bee very true, yea and that there were as yet some of his companions (then absent from the gate and court of the Turke) which caused themselues to bee shod, wheerin to giue me a more faithfull testimonie, he caused me to see one in Andrinople, whose soale of his foote was so harde, that with a bodkin how sharp soeuer it were, ye could not easily pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e it. And being thus shod the better to counterfait the horses, did wear in their mouth a bal of siluer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peichz weare a bal in their mouthes like horses</NOTE> perced &amp; made with holes in diuers places, like vnto the bit of a bridle, &amp; is for to keepe their mouth fresh &amp; the longer to sustain their breath. Round about their girdle, which was very large &amp; very wel wrought of leather, they hung diuers cymbals or belles, which by mouing &amp; shaking in their running made a very plesant and delectable noyce, obseruing that manner as I beleeue of the Tartares, as Marc Paule Venetian hath written, saying, that the foot postes or messengers of the greate Cham Cublay Emperour of the Tartares dyd likewyse in runnyng weare a Gyrdle houng full of Belles, lyke as the Peichz nowe a dayes doe and in one hande carryed an Anagiach, which is as muche as to say a litle

hatchet damaskined, and in the other hand a cruese or viall ful of sweete and smelling water to besprinkle suche as they doe meete in their way for to haue of them some peece of money. Their cappes, whiche they called Meulai were not of siluer as nowe adayes they are, but onely couered with veluet or some light cloth of gold, vpon the tops whereof they fastned certain common plumets of Eastrige seathers, or of other birdes. And these iollie lackies haue such an opinion of thēselues that they do not thinke in the whole world to be any other persons that can runne with like force and swiftnesse, whereat is not to bee maruailed, for truly they do run so swiftly, that the best horse in Turkie could not do the like: so as beeing so required they trauel frō Cōstātinople to Andrinople &amp; back again in 2. daies &amp; 2. nights, as by som I haue been credibly informed, which is as much as a good horse keeping his ordinarie pase, could doe in foure dayes, beeing distant from the one citie too the other fiue daies iourney of the Turkish iourneies, being three or four daies trauell in England: and the reason wherefore theyr iour∣neies are longer then ours, is that they doe not goe or ryde frō the morning to the euening as we doe, but frō the morning to high noone. And being arriued at the place of their baite, whe∣ther it be in town or village, they take vp their lodging in a Car∣uasseras, which is like vnto a barne or greate stable insteed of an Inn, for that ther are none throughout the whole coūtrey of Le¦uant. And if it happē that the bayt be too long, they stay at half way or neere vnto the baite in some faire medow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There are no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnes through∣out al Leuant.</NOTE> neere vnto some riuer or fountain, there alighting do let goe their horse to pasture, &amp; set down themselues vnder the shadow of some tree or hedge vpon a carpet, if they haue one, or els vppon the fayre green grasse, refreshing themselues with such victualles as they haue brought with them in their satchel, but doe drink of such drinke as their horses doe, to wit, faire and cleane water, and so being gotten on horseback againe, they proceed on their iour∣ney.

</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD><HI>Chap.</HI> 10.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the games anciently exercised in Asia and Grecia, the Turke hath obserued the Palester of the Athletes, which is too say, the wrestling, being very neare like vnto the old custom of the Greekes, Asians, &amp; Romans, for the great Turks for one of his accustomed recreations, entertaineth in wages o. men, strong, big set, and full of flesh, and sinewes, which are of diuers nations, but the most part Moores, Indians, or Tartares, by the Turks called Peluianders or Guressis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleuianders are Moores, Indians, or tartares.</NOTE> which signifieth wrest∣lers, who at all times and as often as it shall please him to take therein his pleasure, do wrastle before his person two and two with force of armes, beeing bare on all their members, sauing that they weare breaches of leather, gathered &amp; made fast vn∣der the knee, annointed with oyle, as al the rest of their bodies likewise is, according to the auncient custome of the Romans to the intent to giue or to take the lesse hold the one of the o∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVhy wrest∣lers do anoint themselues.</NOTE> by reason of the slipperous glyding of the oyle dropping vpon the dead leather or quick skinne, whereby it commeth to passe, that when they are wel chafed, oftētimes for lack of good hold with the hands, they with their teeth do fasten vppon the flesh of the one &amp; other, like vnto the fighting of the mastiffes with the Beares &amp; wild Buls, &amp; in that order they doe bite and with their teeth nip one another, in y<SUP>e</SUP> nose, eares, or any other part of the bodie sticking out, or wher any hold is to be fastned on, so as oftētimes they do carry away a peece of the flesh with their teeth. The wrestling being thē ended either through vic∣torie or a signe of abstinence giuen, and to wipe of the sweate, they cast about their shoulders a cloath of blew cottē, checked according to their fashiō. And such is their forme, order, appar∣rel and maner of their combat in wrestling, but when they are wythout the barres, and at common rest, they are clothed with a long gowne, which they do cal Dolyman, girded with a large girdle of silke, according to their maner, their head being co∣uered with a bonnet of blacke veluet, or with the fur of a yong lamb, which they cal Taquia, hāging vpō on of their shoulders

after the fashion of the Georgians or the gentlemen of Polonia but that it is more euen &amp; straight, they do say themselues too be impolluted of body &amp; obseruāts of virginitie, which in their opinion (being not vnreasonable) doeth the longer preserue &amp; maintaine their bodies in strength: and what forces with their bodies abandoned soeuer they doe, yet are they not therefore seruants or slaues, but of free condition &amp; for their necessarie prouision haue of the great Lord ten or twelue Aspres a daye.

<HEAD><HI>Chap.</HI> 10.</HEAD>
<P>IT shall not be impertinent nor out of my purpose, if I do speak and intreat of the estates, officers, duties, wages, &amp; seruices of Cooks &amp; other officers of the kitchin of the great Turke, and therfore is to be vnderstood that ordinarily he keepeth within his Sarail 150. cooks, aswel maisters as boies Azamoglās, amōgst which the best &amp; most expertest are chosen &amp; ordained for the priuy kitchin of the great Lord, &amp; the other for the cōmon sort. The Maister cooks haue for their stipend 8. or 10. Aspres a day, &amp; the boyes 3. clothed euery one of thē once in the yere: those of the priuy kitchin haue their furnaces apart for to dresse and make ready the meat without smell of smoke, which being sod∣den and dressed, they lay into platters of purcelan, and so deli∣uer it vnto the Cecigners, whom we do cal caruers, for to serue the same vnto the great Lord, the tast beeing made in his pre∣sence: the other cookes for the cōmon sorte, doe deliuer their meate vnto those whiche haue the charge of the distributing therof throughout the Sarail according to the order made by the officers therunto cōmitted, for ouer these two kitchins, pri¦uie &amp; common are set &amp; ordained foure superiours, of whiche the first being in their language called Hargibassi, is appointed to the charge &amp; keping therof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4.

Aspres a day, amounting to the valew of a ducat, and euery yeere a gowne of silke. The second is cal-Emimmutpagi, whiche is to say, chiefe kater, ordeined for the disbursing of all the money &amp; charges of the kitchin, and hath 50. Aspres a day, &amp; a gowne such as it shall please the Turke to giue him vpon the day of the great Bairam, whiche is their Ea∣ster. The third is the Chechaia or Stewards, ordeined to ouer∣see al that which shal go out or into the kitchins, &amp; to take or∣der in al differences, which might arise amongest the cookes,
<PB REF="94" MS="y"/>
and is prouided in wages like vnto the Emimmutpagi. The 4. and last is called Muptariapagi, who keepeth the books and ac∣counts of the whole charges of the kitchins, &amp; hath the charge to ordayne from day to day, the meat for the diet of the great Lord: and for this office he hath but 30. Aspres by the day, and this is the estate of the Cookes and other officers of the kitchin of the great Turke and of his Sarail.</P>
<P>Now there resteth to speake of the dressing of their meat &amp; the ordinary maner of eating of the Turks which farre differeth from ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great differēce betwixte the Turks &amp; vs in dressing of meate.</NOTE> being so superfluous, curious, and delicate, and our Cookes dressing the same accordingly: wheras to the contrary theirs is scant, bare, and grosse, without anye diuersities of lar∣dings, dressinges, sawces, ioyces, and confections: their Cookes being very simple dressers of meat, as being neither dainty nor delicate in y<SUP>e</SUP> dressing therof. For the Turks do content thēselues with slight meates &amp; easily dressed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meates of the Turkes.</NOTE> so as they be nourishing or restoratiue: as Bucks flesh, Goates fleshe, Mutton, Lambe, and Kidde, and certayne Hennes, whereof there they haue as fatte and as sauery as in anye other place, where I haue beene. They do eate little beefe, and lesse veale, for they say that the cow ha¦uing her calfe taken away from her would loose her milke, and thereby should lack butter, cheese, and other whitemeat, they hold the sheepes feet for a very delicate meate, which ordinari∣ly in diuers shops at Constantinople are set foorth to be solde readie sodden &amp; dressed with pilled garlike, which is their com¦mon sauce at all times, there are also to be sold pies of minced meate, and rice dressed with butter and almonds very sauorie and of a good taste: as for the fleshe they wyll rather eate it rosted then sodde, and do roast the same in maner following: They haue a great Iron potte of the bignesse of a ketle, in the bottome whereof they doe lay red burning coales, and ouer it a gredyron, vpon the which they doe roast their flesh through the vapour and heate of the coales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water is the moste commō drinke of the Turkis</NOTE> which can neither be whol∣some nor daintie. And to be short their kitchins &amp; Cookes are nothyng lyke vnto ours: as for their drynke, their most vsuall and common beurage is that which is natural vnto al beastes in the worlde, too witte, fayre and cleare water. But they
<PB N="91" REF="94" MS="y"/>
haue notwithstanding other drinkes artificially made and con∣fectioned of diuers sortes which they doe sel in sundry places of the city. Some made with water and barley after the maner of Ale▪ some other of peares or apples, or with the seething toge∣ther of plummes, reisons, figges▪ peares, peaches, and other lyke fruits, &amp; of the beurage which they do cal Sorbet, they do much vse to drinke in the sommer with yse or snow to coole the same. They do also drinke much Aqua vitae both at and after meales which they cal Archent. As for natural wine, notwithstanding that by the Mahumetical law, the drinking therof is forbidden them, yet do they for all that leaue it nothing at all, taking of it oftentimes so much in, that scarce they are able to beare it. But it is when it costeth them nothing, for there is no nation in the worlde which seeke more theyr owne aduauntage then these Turkes doe, specially when they maye get it of the Chrystians, because they doe spend more and keep better cheere then they of their nation doe. For example whereof, I haue often times seene diuers of them, &amp; of the principallest, as Secretaries, Dra∣gomans, and other officers of the great Turke which came to the lodging of Monsieur Darramont our Ambassador, to ban∣quet and make merry, and without any curtesie drunk as much as pleased them, which nothing was refused them, but to the contrary the Ambassadour wel knowing their natural inclyna∣tion, forgotte nothing which might serue for their good inter∣tainment, aswell with delicate meats, as diuers sortes of good wines both Malmesies and Muscadels, wherof they do stuffe thē¦selues so ful, that oftentimes in going home to their houses the largest &amp; broadest streets in the city are too narrow for them. And are so farre from shame and honest ciuility, that they doe not thinke they haue made good cheere, nor attribute any ho∣nour vnto those that haue feasted them, except they bee made beastly drunk. Notwithstāding that by theyr law as I haue said, they are specially forbidden to drinke wine or to bee drunken, wherat they make no great scruple &amp; lesse sinne, so as they may drink free without their cost. They haue another order to make themselues drunk without wine which is with their Opium,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Opium wyll make them drunke.</NOTE> be∣ing a composition made with a white stuffe, wherof the Turkes
<PB REF="95"/>
doe not only vse, but also the Persians and other people of Le∣uant, through the opinion which they haue, that it maketh thē to forget choler &amp; melancholy, &amp; so causeth them to be ioyfull and merry, and in the warres more stoute and hardy. Of which Opium after they haue taken in of it about a Dragma, doth so worke with them, and maketh them so out of square, that they loose both their wits and vnderstanding, for they go reeling a∣bout the streetes, holding one of another, as the other Drun∣kardes doe, foming out of the mouth like vnto chafed boares, making fierce and terrible cries and howlings like vnto doggs. And being in this case, it is not good for Iewes or Christians to meet with them, least they should be well beaten with fystes or cudgels. But those which are most to be feared in the meeting are those 3. kinds which in the former chapter I haue liuely de∣scribed vnto you: to wit, the Azamoglans, the Leuentis, and the Azappis being renied Christians, and mortall enemies vnto all Christians, and those which do vnto them the most wrongs and outrages, and thus ye haue heard of the manner of eating and drinking of the Turkes, farre differing from ours. But because I will not forgette to touch the manner of the apparrell of these Cooks, I wil say that they do weare a long coate of marokin or leather closed, and shutting the same vppon the brest with great flat buttons of tinne insteed of siluer, wearing on their heads a white Zarcole like vnto the Ianissaries, but without any fringe of gold or other enrichment in al respects as the figure follow∣ing doth represent vnto you.</P>

<P>I Was not determined to haue intreated in this first tome any thing belonging vnto the religion of the Turkes, pretending to haue reserued the same for the second part, where I hope by God his grace too declare, as before I haue proposed, all that whiche may concerne their religion and ceremonies of their iustice and administration thereof which with the same is con∣ioynct. But hauing afterwards considered that the strange di∣uersitie wherewith these doctours of their lawe doe disguise themselues: and also their Priests, Monkes, religious Heremits and Pilgrimes, would no lesse delight the spirites and sight of the Readers, thē the curious desire to vnderstand of their bru∣tish liues &amp; abhominable superstition, I thought it not imper∣tinent to set heare in order onely the pourtractes and figures of the principallest amongst them with a briefe description &amp; declaration vpō euery of their figures, beginning with the two Cadilesquers, great doctours of their law &amp; chiefe of their iu∣stice, the one of them beeing ordeined for the administration of Grecia, and the other for Natolia.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. cadilisqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> one for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tolie and on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Grecia</NOTE> These Cadilesquers are reputed amongest the Turkes, in the estate of religion, of like dignitie and reuerence, as the Metropolitans are in the church of Grecia and the Patriarches in the Romane Church: and in the exercise of iustice, as Chauncellours or chiefe Presidentes, being created and elected vnto this dignitie and auctoritie not by fauourable ambition▪ but through honorable election out of the first and most learned doctours of their lawe, because they should be approued so pertinent and sufficient in know∣ledge, that they themselues be prouided of wisedome, counsel, &amp; good iudgement, before they wil counsaile or iudge others, which they could not do, &amp; lesse shuld be possible vnto thē to decide iustly, an arrest of Iustice, in matter or waight and of

They doe also burne them∣selues on the temples with an old cloath burned for too take away and dry vp the humours of the braynes, and too let that they shoulde not fall downe vpon their eyes, and take awaye their sight. The Libians, as Herodote in his fourth bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e doth write, had the like custome, to burne the vaines of the braynes or of the temples of the young children when they were come to be foure yeres olde, with wool or cotten, to preuent the fal∣lyng downe of the Catharres so long as they lyued, and were of opinion that the same made thē a great deale more health∣full.</P>

But these impo∣sters Torlaquis vnder colour &amp; pretext of their false religion, doe further commit many other more greater abuses, not on∣ly false and inconuenable, but enorme and most blasphemous against the diuine prouidence, for that oftentimes they lead a∣mongest them an auncient old man, whom they reuerence &amp; worship like a God: and being come into any towne or village they doe lodge themselues as neare as possible they can in the best and richest house, placing themselues rounde about him with most faygned humilitie, and hypocriticall reuerence. Af∣terwards, this good hypocrite, beeing no lesse growen in kna∣uery then in age, fayneth himselfe to be rauished in spirite, pro∣nouncing at sundrie times a fewe wordes, and those full of gra∣uitie and spirituall commandementes, and as if hee were in a traunce, lifteth vp his eyes vnto heauen, and afterwardes by lit∣tle and little turning himselfe toowardes his disciples spea∣keth vnto them in thys manner: My welbeloued chyldren I praye you too take mee awaye, and carrye mee out of thys Towne, for in lyftynge vppe mine eyes vnto heauen I haue bothe seene and vnderstanded by deuine Reuelation greate tribulation too bee prepared for the same. And then these gentle disciples beyng well instructed and taught in this sort of knauery, do altogether with great affection desire him to make his prayers to God, that he would appease and mitigate the yre which iustly he had determined against such a desolate citie, and the inhabitants thereof. The reuerend olde man shewing hym∣selfe by their prayer to bee wonne, and wel inclined to doe the same with his simuled holinesse, beginneth to make a feigned

prayer vnto God, desiring him to forbeare his threatned fury, and euil eminent. Then this poore barbarous and ignoraunt people being feared with the diuine threatning, and comfor∣ted through the deprecation of this reuerend reuealer and In∣tercessour, doe runne towardes him from all partes, giuing so muche faith vnto the masked hypocrisie of this olde foxe, that they are fully perswaded, that all these diuelish &amp; abused works are diuine myracles. For which by charitable admiration, they doe bring vnto them so many almes, that these false religious at their departure from that place, haue like vnto Somners, as ma∣ny brybes as they can carry away. And hauing thus spedd they returne to their houses triumphing of their impostrie, and ma∣king merrie cheare at the costes of these too muche credulent people, which doe giue the same vnto them, of whose foolishe simplicitie they go mocking &amp; scoffing amongest themselues.

<P>THere are diuers amongst the Turks, which doe call them∣selues &amp; for such are reputed, kinsemen of Mahomet, wher∣of some doe weare a greene Tulbant, and the other a Muzaue∣gia, which is to say, a bonnet whiche they doe weare vnder the Tulbant being of colour green:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahomets kinsemen doe weare a gar∣ment &amp; Tul∣bant seueral to be known frō others.</NOTE> &amp; al the rest of the Tulbāt white They do weare such colour for that they say their Prophet ware the like on his head, and contrarie to the Turks. The Sophians whiche are the Persians, weare redde ones. Sophy is not the name of the King of persia (as some doe thinke) for this name commeth of their sect and religion, which commandeth them of an humility, not to weare on their heades any habite; more precious then wool, and for that in the Arabian tongue wool is called Sophy, those which are of this sect are called So∣phians, and in derision the Turks do cal them Kesulbach, which is to say, redde heads. The Turks &amp; the Sophians doe say that it were not reasonable to couer the dishonest partes of the body, with the colour which the Prophetes did weare on their heads. And therefore is no more permitted vnto the Turkes to weare green hose, then vnto the Sophians to weare red hosen: &amp; who∣soeuer should weare them, shuld be esteemed amongst them as an heretike. And therefore is not permitted vnto any: but vnto such as do say themselues to be sprong of the kinred of Maho∣met, to weare a greene Tulbant, and therefore are called Ies∣silbas, wich is to say greene heads. They are also commonly cal∣led Emirs, which may be interpreted, kinsemen of the Prophet, and are holden in such reputation for holinesse of life that in iudgement, the testimony or witnessing of one of them is allow∣ed for 2. others. But they are so mischieuous &amp; vnhappy, that for money they wil make no conscience to beare such false witnes, such as ye wil haue thē: &amp; specially if he be a Iewe or a Christian vnto whom they are mortal enimies.

<P>THe Turkes, Moores, and all other such barbarous nations, liuing vnder the obseruance of the law, &amp; commādement of the false prophet Mahomet, find written in diuers places &amp; pas∣sages of their Alcoram, that God hath promised vnto all Musul∣mans which through deuotion should go to visit the temple of Mecqua by the Arabians called Alcaaba, that he woulde neuer send their soules into perdition. Vpon confidēce of which pro∣mise they will gladly goe on such pilgrimage, leauing vndone al other houshold or common affaires, and foreseeing the diffi∣culty of the voyage, by reason of the long desarts and sandes, whereby they must passe, doe beginne these pilgrimages, some soone, and some later, according to the distaunce of the Coun∣trey, because they wil be at Mecqua against Easter, which they do cal Chucci Bairam. But before they do depart, because their voyage should be the more lucky, they doe aske one another forgiuenesse of their offences. And then the day of their depar∣ture being come, they doe assemble in great companies, taking their way, first towards the city of Damas or of Caire, which the Arabians doe call Alcair where the crewe doth assemble: for they will not depart lightly, except they be at the least thirty or fortie thousand in a companye, with a good number of Ia∣nissaries appoynted for the securitie, conduct, defence and safe∣gard of them, and to take regarde that the same be not pilled and saccaged of the Arabians, which day and night are wat∣ching in the desarts to spoile and take the pilgrims and tra∣uaylers. And besides that, the companye hauing to passe tho∣row so manye desartes, sandye, wythered, vnfruitefull, and lacking of all thinges necessarye for mans sustenance, order is taken for the loding of many Cammels with great prouision of victuals, fodder and water, aswell for the persons,
as for the Cammels and other beastes, for that in these sandye and drye
<PB REF="115" MS="y"/>
wildernesses no droppe of water is founde but from three dayes to 3. dayes iourney, whiche notwithstanding they must get with force of armes from the Arabians, which keep and de∣fend the same: hauing then thus passed these desarts, and the Pilgrims arriued at Medine Thalnabi, which also hath bin called Tribic, or as others do say Iezrab. They do go vnto the temple and there lay their Alcoram vpon the sepulture of Mahomet. And after that, the houre of seruice being come, the Maizins be¦ginne to cry vppon the towres as their custome is, to call the people together to come vnto their ceremonies, and there re∣mayne in prayer the space of 3. houres, which ended, they re∣paire vnto a mount neere vnto the town called Arafetagi, vpon the which they doe strippe themselues starke naked, and goe to bathe in a riuer neere vnto it, euen to the necke, mumbling out certaine long prayers: which ended, they go out of the wa∣ter to putte on their clothes agayne: and the nexte morning they proceede on their way towardes Mecqua, being 3. small dayes iourney from Medine: where they being come, do enter into the temple to say their prayers. After which they goe tur∣ning seuen times about a fouresquare towre, at euery circuite kissing the edge thereof, from thence they goe vnto a pit of salt water, which they cal Birzenzen, being closed within a Tower, being from the other, ten or twelue pases, pronouncing these wordes. All this be to the honour of God which is most merci∣full, God forgiue me al my sinnes. These wordes being ended, certayne mynisters there appointed to draw the water doe cast vpon the head of euery one of them three small buckets full, without sparing of their clothes. These beastly Mahometistes thinking through such outward washing to be cleansed &amp; pur∣ged of their inward sinnes.</P>
<P>Moreouer, they say, that the tower which they seuen tymes doe goe about, was the first house of prayer whiche Abraham buylded through the commaundement of God. Nowe when they are in this towre well washed and bathed, they goe to doe their sacrifice vppon a mount neere vnto it, presenting for an offering manye sheepe whiche beeyng immolated and sacryficed, they doe distribute amongest the poore for
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>
God his sake. The sacrifice being thus ended, a Sermon is made vnto them by the Cady Muselman, and that beng done, euerye one of them doe goe to cast 2. stones in a place, where they say the Diuel appeared to Abraham when he builded the temple. From thence they returne to Mecqua to say diuers other pray∣ers, desiring God to exalt them as he exalted Abraham to the building of the temple. All these ceremonies being accomply∣shed▪ they depart to goe towardes Ierusalem, which they cal Cu∣zumobarech, &amp; there do visite the holy mount where the tem∣ple of Solomon was, which they holde in great reuerēce. In this place they do celebrate another feast, and there exercise new ce∣remonies. At the departure from the temple of Solomon euery one taketh his way to returne homewards or els where he doth thinke good. And thus they goe in troupes carrying great ban∣ners with a pyke &amp; halfe moone in the top of the staffe, going a∣bout the townes &amp; villages▪ singing the praises of their greate Prophet Mahomet, and asking of almes for the honor of God, &amp; that which is giuen them they do eate altogether, beyng sett downe in the middest of the common place, &amp; after they haue thus eaten with a great hypocrisie and shew of holines, they doe openly make their prayers. The most part of these pilgrim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (which the Turks call Hagislars) are Moores, clothed poorely i∣nough although that diuers of them doe say to bee descended of the line of Mahomet, as the Emirs aboue mentioned.

<P>IT is founde in the Alcoram that Mahomet prophet of the Turks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVine forbid∣den by Mah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣met and why.</NOTE> doth forbid al his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectators Mahometistes to drinke wine. For that he did esteeme it a true nourishment of all euils and sinnes: and also as diuers haue written, to keepe the Arabi∣ans with such seuere prohibitiō in greater sobriety, who for the naturall heat which is in them, taking the wine in too aboun∣dantly, would not so easily suffer themselues to be tamed nor brought vnder subiection: by reason of these defences, are tho∣rowout whole Turky, Graecia, and other prouinces vnder the o∣beisance of the great Turke, a great nūber of Turkes &amp; Moores called Sacquaz, which dayly goe by the streetes, places and as∣semblies of the cities, townes, and suburbes of the said prouin∣ces, with a scrippe of leather ful of fountaine or cestarne water, hoūg on their side, &amp; couered aboue with a faire cloth embro∣dered with leaues about it or els plaine: &amp; in one hand, a cup of fine Corinthian latten guilded and damaskined out of the which of great charity they doe offer and giue to drink, al them that will: but yet for to make the water seem more faire &amp; de∣lectable to drinke, they put within the cuppe many and diuers stones of Calcedonie, Iaspe and lapis Azuli, bearing in the same hand a lookingglasse which they hold before the eyes of those to whom they giue to drink, exhorting and admonishing them with words demonstratiue to think on death: for doing the of∣fice of this gentlenes, they wil aske no paiment nor recompēce; but if through honest liberality some peece of monie be giuen vnto them, they wil most gladly receiue it, and in manner of thankes and congratulation, they pull out of a budget or poke which hangeth at their girdle a vyollfull of sweet smelling wa∣ter, which they cast on the face and beard of him that hath gi∣uen them money. I haue in a morning at Constantinople seene fifty of these Sacquas in a companye, all furnished with theyr scrips, large girdles, cups, glasses &amp; al other their instrumēts, whi¦che thus apparelled went through the city demāding their new

yeres gifts of al those they met withal, whether they were Turks Christians, or Iewes in the honour of one of their saints, whose feast they celebrated that day. And the more to prouoke men to giue vnto them, presented to the one an apple, to the other an orange, or as I haue said, did cast sweet water in their faces, for you must vnderstand that the liberality of the Turkes and Moores is so great that they will hazard to giue the value of a Mangor, which is the 8. part of an Aspre, to haue two or three Aspres again for it. The same day in the afternoone these woor∣shipful Sacquas with their ornature came vnto me to the house of my Lord the Ambassador, where then I was lodged, he being then in Andrinopole, to see as they said, the picture which the day before I had made of one of their companions, whiche brought them thither. But the end was, that they would not de∣part without hauing of me some present, alleadging by their reasons that they had done me great honour, in comming to vi∣sit me with the best of their stuffe and apparrel, so as for to ridd my self of them I gaue them about 20. Aspres, and so being very well contented, they returned to the place from whence they came. Now to returne vnto my first purpose, some of these Sac∣quas, do this office of charitie through deuotion, whiche they haue receiued at Mecqua, but the others doe it for hope of a gaine, which they pretend to get therby, for besides that which is giuen vnto them of almes, they are waged either publikely, or of som in particular.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">X</SEG>Enophon in his first booke of Cyro∣pedie, which is to saye, of the life and institution of Cyrus, speaking of the auncient custome of the Persians, sayth that they had a certayne great place called the place of libertie, whereas was the Pallace royall, and other houses publike; and that the same place was deuided into foure quarters. The first, being for the chil∣dren: the second, for the young menne: the thirde, for men of perfect age: and the fourth for the auncient and aged men vn∣fit for the warres. Euery one of the aforesaide degrees were by the lawes constrayned to repayre at a time and houre ap∣pointed in his quarters. To wit, the children and perfect aged men at the point of the day: the auncients at certaine dayes and houres for the affaires of the common wealth. The charge of the young menne was in the euening to present themsel∣ues in armes, and so to passe about the houses publike, except those which were married, which were not bound to appeare except they were thereunto specially commaunded. Euerye one of these quarters hadde twelue Prouosts of the most wise and grauest that coulde bee chosen, for that the nation of the Persians was deuided into twelue lynes. Ouer the children were appointed certaine of the most auncient, wyse, and best

aduised for to bring thē vp in vertue. To the yong men, well to instruct thē: to the mē of perfect age, others were cōmitted &amp; deputed for to accustome and keepe them in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, for the due obeysance towardes their Prince. The auncients also had their superiours, which admonished them in the perfection of their dutie: vnto the Prouosts, was giuen the charge and administra∣tion of iustice, to doe right vnto euery man, to condemne the offendours and false accusers, but aboue all other vices, ingra∣titude was most seuerely punished: for that they knewe ingra∣titude to be the spring of al vices, the enemie of nature, poyson vnto sweetnesse, and destruction of benignitie. They did more∣ouer take great paines to make their children patient and o∣bedient towardes their superiours, and able too endure both hunger and thyrst, They neuer went to take their repast with∣out leaue and permission of their superiours and neuer dyd eate in the sight of their mothers, but in presence of their ma∣sters, hauing none other meate then bread and other small pulaunce, and for their drinke nothing but cleare water: their exercise was to cast the dart &amp; to shoot: &amp; being thus brought vp from the age of 6. to 17. yeres, and came vnto the degree of yong men, vnder which they remained 10. yeres more, passyng as I haue said, in the nightes to goe about the streets &amp; houses, aswel for the watch and surety of the towne, as for to make thē strong and able to endure paynes, and to withdraw them from vice and voluptuousnes. In the day time they did represent thē∣selues before the Gouernours to be imployed in the publike affayres, as was commaunded vnto them: and whensoeuer the king would goe on hunting (as euery moneth he did,) he took the one halfe with him, set out and furnished with bowes and arrowes a skayne with a buckler, and two dartes to throwe at length, and the other weapons to fight at hand. And in this ex∣ercise they were instructed by the king as if it had beene in the warres, so as he woulde not hunt himselfe alone, but had also a carefull regarde that his menne should doe as he did, saying and esteeming, hunting to be a true exercise of thinges requi∣site for the discipline of warres, as being an argument &amp; occasiō
<PB REF="119" MS="y"/>
to vse men to ryse betimes to forbeare heate and cold, hunger and thyrst, and to trauaile and run a long while: they also tooke their meate with them, and dined not, before the hunting was ended, nor yet hadde they that which they had taken, nor yet their Cartadanne, which is to say, their accustomed fee. As for the other halfe of the young menne that were left in the towne, whilest these were a hunting, exercised them selues in those thinges whiche in their infancie they hadde learned, to wit, to cast the dart, and shoote in companies. And if any oc∣casion fel out to take theeues and robbers, they were bounde to waite on the Maiestrate, and to assist him in the watche. Af∣terwardes hauing spent tenne yeres in this order of discipline, they were put amongest the degre of the men perfect in age, in which state they remained xxv. yeeres more. And if neede re∣quired to goe to the warres they carried no more arrowes nor dartes, but all sorts of weapons to fight at hand, as the corslet on his backe. The shield in the the one hand, and the sword in the other hand. The Maiestrates were chosen and elected out of this degree, except the gouernors that hadde the charge o∣uer the children, who after they hadde thus liued and attained vnto the yeres of fiftie or aboue: they resorted with the elders and were no more subiect to goe vnto the warres out of their countrie. And might freely returne to their houses to Iudge of the affayres both common &amp; priuate, giue sentences of death and to chose Maiestrates. In those dayes the common wealth of the Persians conteined about sixe score thousande men of which none was excluded from comming to the said estate ho¦nour and dignitie,
for vnto euerie Persian it was lawfull to put his children to the schole of the lawes, if he had wherewithall to maintaine and keepe them, or els they brought them vp in the learning of some science or occupation. The children that had beene brought vp in the lawes might haunt and frequent amongest the young men, afterwards might also be acquinted with the perfect men, and atchieue (according to their vertue) vnto honours and dignities. And the men perfect, accompany amongst the old men, to be preferred vnto the gouernment of the common wealth, so as they had passed their time &amp; yeeres without reprehension.</P>

In Persia are founde many aunci∣ent and moderne Cities, whereof the most auncients are Ba∣bylon, now called Baiadet. Suse which is altogether ruined, ex∣cept the Castle, whereof as yet a part standeth: the great citie of Procopolis or Percepolis vppon the flood Araxes, in times past destroyed by Alexander the great. Likewise the Citie of Scyras, whiche remaineth in her autiquitie, conteyning in cir∣cuit with the suburbs, twentie thousand paces. Moreouer the Citie of Alexandria (otherwise called Isia, cituated vpon the ri∣uer Syria) and Arion, lying all on the foote of the mount Cau∣case, vppon the riuer Euprates (whiche the Arabians call Afo∣rat) are the Cities of Ioppe and Nicephore, the Castle of Isse, where Darius was ouerthrowne and discomfited. The Cities of Thesiphon and Carra, where was broken the armie of Mar∣cus Crassus, in which place are as yet seene diuers sepulchres and antiquities, whiche the Inhabitannts doe say to be of the Romane Senatours, which dyed in the same ouerthrowe. The Cities of Persogade, Opine and others, bordering vppon Ar∣menia the greater, being vnder the dominion of the Sophy. In which Armenia vpon the riuer Euprates, are many townes in∣habited of Christians, Georgians, being mē valiant at armes.

Vpon the said riuer of Euphrates lieth the citie of Adene, and the castle of Bir. The Cities of Merchin, Assanchef, Sair, Chesfen, Vastian and Coy, all being cituated on the toppe, and about the mount Cortestan.

<P>IF amongest the women of the East partes, the Persians haue of all auncestrie obtained the laud and prayse to be the most gentle, and proper in their apparrel and cloathing, so are they likewise no lessefull made in proportion of their bodies and naturall beautie:
namely, and aboue al other, those of the aun∣cient and royall Citie of Sciras, which are so praysed in their beautie, whitenesse, pleasant ciuilitie and shamefast grace, that the Moores of an olde and common Prouet be will say, that their Prophet Mahomet would not go to Scyras, for feare that hee hauing once tasted of the pleasures of those women, his soule after his death could neuer haue entred into Paradise, we haue moreouer sufficient testimonie of the singular beautie of these Persian women by Alexander the great, who keeping the daughters of the king Darius, as his prisoners, would neuer sa∣lute them but with his eyes looking downewards, and besides so seldome as he could, for the feare which hee had of beeing ouercome with their beautie, and would saye sometimes vnto his familiar friendes, that the daughters of the Persians did great harme vnto the eyes of those that looked vpon them.</P>
<P>The Persians in their habite goe very honourably clothed, and like vntoo the Turkes and Grecians weare long gownes, closed and buttoned before, and attyre their heads with sun∣dry bandes of diuers colours, the endes whereof hang downe verye lowe before and behinde ouer their shoulders, in the fourme and maner as the picture following doth shew vn∣to you, which I haue naturally drawen out in Constantinople, with the fauor of a Persian with whom I was entred in friend∣ship,

<P>To come to the more easier knowledge of the lawes, man∣ners, customes, religion, and maner of lyuing of the aunci∣ent and moderne Arabians, I haue taken in hande first to be∣ginne with the description of their countrey, which according to ptolomie and other Geographers aswel ancient as moderne hath bin diuided into three prouinces, to wit, Arabia the sto∣nye, Arabia the desart, and Arabia the happy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arabia parted into three pro∣uinces.</NOTE> Arabia the sto∣ny was thus called of the name of the old and famous citye of Petra (called in Esaie the stone of the desart) and presently ac∣cording to Voleteran, Arach. Notwithstanding that the vulgare Arabians doe cal it Rabach, cituated vpon the brooke Arnon: and wheras aunciently was the seat royall, namely in the time of the most puissant king Areta, which about the comming of our sauiour into the world was king. Or els this countrie is called stonie, because of the great mountaines and rocks which enuirone &amp; close the same in. Notwithstanding, that within the same are found diuers fountaines abounding of very good wa∣ters: she bordereth on the West with Egypt, almost in the midst of Istma, being between the castles of Posside, presently called Ara, and Rinocorura, lying vpon the further parts of the redde sea, or the Arabian sea, &amp; on the part of our Mediterane sea, the lake of Syrboni, betweene which space (whereof Plinie maketh but 125. myles) the seas cōming frō diuers parts do diuide thē∣selues. And the third part of the world which is Asia the grea∣ter, ioyneth there with the firme land of Egypt aboue Istma, at the mouth of the red sea, which appertaineth vnto this Arabia, and extendeth beyond the gulph Elanitick, and the city Elane of whom this gulph hath taken his name. Of the East and the south it is enuironed with moūtains, which diuide the same on the one side from Arabia the happy: and on the other part frō

the desart. On the North it bordereth with Syria entring vnto the lake Asphaltide (so named because of the aboundaunce of the Asphalte which it produceth: which is gathered vppon this lake, of whiche is made the Greeke fire, some doe call it Stercus Demonum, for that the smell thereof stinketh verye muche) Philadelphe and Batanee, and in none other place is the sayde Arabia more fertile then in this, This Arabia was in times past through the great heat &amp; barrēnesse of the fields, lit∣tle estemed of the auncients, but we ought otherwise to think thereof, for the memorie and reuerence of the dyuine things which there haue happened: for be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingly shee receyued and kept the children of Israel: for the space of forty yeeres, after they had maruellously passed dry foote through the redde sea. And likewise the same tyme the Citie of Madian nourished Moyses, his wife and children. Likewise within the same is the mount Sinai, or Oreb, which Ptolome calleth Melane, and the Moores Turla▪ vpon the which the law was giuen vnto Moyses. Neere vnto this mount is the stone, which beeing touched by the saide Moyses, cast forth water abundantly to the great alte∣ration of the children of Israel. Likewise towards Egypt is the mount Casie so renowned for the sepulture of Pompee the great, which there is. Plynie calleth the people of this Ara∣bia, and of the desart Scenites, because they dwelled vnder tentes &amp; cabbynes, wythout hauing any other houses or buyl∣dinges, and like Vagabondes went straying with their cattell from place to place, staying onely at the place where aboun∣daunce of pasture bade them.

Many haue written that besides these greate desartes, there is another called the sandye sea, the greatest whereof whiche is called Benahali is in breadth twelue dayes iourney, beyng all whyte and loose sande.</P>
<P>These saide desarts are called sea, for that like vnto the sea, they are subiect vnto the fortune of the wyndes, so as those which doe conduct the Carouanes, are constrayned to helpe them selues with the carde and compasse as the marriners doe vpon the sea. And he which is the guide goeth before moūted on a cammel: but if through misfortune the wind come cōtra∣ry vnto their way, diuers are found buried in the sand: &amp; whē∣soeuer that hapneth few do escape the peril: these dead carcases being by succession of time discouered, are curiously takē vp, &amp; carried vnto the merchants, who buy the same, and is, as diuers do affirme, that which is called Mumie.

The principallest places of this Arabia, neere vnto the redde Sea, are the Citie of Zidem, the porte of Mecqua, and the yle of Camarran, The people thereof are of com∣plection neerer the blacke then white, and are all Mahome∣tistes.</P>

The richest &amp; best peopled nation of this region are the Sabees. The Metro∣politan Citie wherof is called Saba, cituated on a high moun∣ted in which their king was in times past created by succession of linage, with great honour and reioycing of the people, whose life although the same seemed to be happy for that he might do al thinges, and had euery man at commaundement without giuing account or reason of those thinges which he did, it was mixed with a great many of perplections: for that it was not permitted vnto him to goe out of his pallace vppon paine (that attempting the contrary) to bee foorthwith stoned by the peo∣ple, being an auncient superstition and obseruance which they had by an oracle of their goddes. This region aboue all the o∣ther in the world, is the most pleasant and abundant of things pretious &amp; Aromaticke. Moreouer it beareth corne aboundāt∣ly, oliues &amp; all other excellent fruites, and is watered with dy∣uers riuers, &amp; most wholesome fountaines.

Palme trees, Cinamond, Casse &amp; Ledanū, the sauour of these trees being vnto the smelling of men of such a sweetnesse: that the same seemeth rather to be heauenly then earthly or humane. So as it might be saide, that nature consul∣ted there to gather togither so many good and sweete smelles. In the same forrests are a great number of redd and venimous serpents, which leaping vpon men doe byte them with poyson most daungerous and mortall.

But Pedro Gesa of Leon, in hys second part of the history general of the west Indies, saith: that neere vnto the riuer Marannon, is found great quantitie of Frā∣kincense, better then that of Arabia. In this place are also found the Sardonique stones, Molochite, and those which are called I∣ris, being of colour as cleere as crystal, the Andromede also and the Pederote, which Plinie calleth Opalius: it is saide also, that there is bred the bird Phaenix, which liueth as some do say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>40. yeeres: but Pliny saith 660. yeres; &amp; Manilius, Senator of Rome affirmeth, that with the life of this bird, the reuolution of the great yere is made, which diuers (as Solin) say to consist, not in 540. yeres, but in 12950. yeres.

These do dwel in the parties of Bossine, &amp; Seruia, bordering vppon Graecia on the one side, and on the other, Hungarie and Austria, and at this present time are cal∣led Seruians or Crouats, whiche are the true Illirians, whom Herodian in the life of Seuerus, describeth to bee men most valiaunt, of greate stature, well shapen, and bigge sette, their colour beyng yealowishe, but of nature most malitious, and of custome more then barbarous, of grosse vnderstanding, and easie to be deceiued. Notwithstanding they were in great e∣stimation with Alexander the great: yea, so that oftētimes they durst vndertake to take in hand the occupying of Macedonia. The Turks doe call them Dellys, which is to say hardye fooles: but amongest them they call themselues Zatasnicis, which sig∣nifieth in their language, defyers of men, for that euerye one of them are bounde to fight agaynst tenne (before they can at∣tayne to the name and token of Delly, or Zatasnici) they chal∣lenge alwaies body for body, to breake the speare vppon their enimies, vsing in their fightes many guyles and craftes, which are remained to them from their auncestors, with such dexteri∣ty &amp; hardines, that most often they remaine victorious.

Vppon the head he hadde a long cappe after the Polonian or Georgian fashion, hangyng downe ouer one of his shoulders made of a Leopardes skynne well spotted, and ouer the same before the foreheade for too shew more ferefull, was fastned a long tayle of an Eagle and the two winges nayled vpon the target with two great yron nailes, which hee carryed in a scarfe about his shoulders: hys armes were the Cymiter or skayne, and the dagger: and in the ryghte hande the Busdegan, whiche is to saye, the mase of armes well damaskaned. But certaine when hee departed from Andrino∣pole, with the forces whiche Achmat Bascha (whiche since the great Turke caused to bee strangled in his bedde) carryed for the great Lord into Transsiluania, I saw him mounted on a fair Turkie horse decked with the whole skinne of a great Lion, fa∣stened with the two formost feet before vpon the brest, and the other two hanging downe behind, his Busdegan hung at his sadle bow, &amp; in his right hand bare a long launce, the poleaxe at the point being well steeled, altogeather beeing as yee may liuely see in the picture following.

<P>WIthin the citie of Constātinople, neere vnto the 7 towres there is a great street for the most part inhabited by the Caramanians (by the auncients called Cilicians) liuing as other strange nations do vnder the tribute of the great Turke and ex∣ercising marchandises or handicraftes, wherein they are verye ingenious and cunning, specially in goldsmithes worke, &amp; im∣brodering. The Goldsmithes keepe their shops neere vnto the Bezestan, which is, as before I haue said, a hall, whereas al sortes of costly marchandises are solde, as of golde, of siluer, of stones, furres, cloth of gold, and of siluer and silke, slaues, Cammels &amp; horses vnto him that most biddeth: Amongst which Caramani∣ans are the most excellent and richest workes.</P>

<P>AS for the countrey of Caramania, first called Cilicia, of the name of Caelix the sonn of Agenor, according to Herodote, Hipachea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cilicia of Ci∣lix.</NOTE> is described by Ptolome in his fift booke as a pro∣uince of little Asia, hauing for her borders towardes the East, the mount Aman, presently called the blacke mountaine, of the North the mount of Taur, of the west side a part of Pamphi∣lia, and on the other part of the South the vttermost partes of the goulph Issique, which now is called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asse. This region is en∣uyroned with high and sharpe mountaines, from the whiche drop towardes the sea, diuers riuers. And of these mountaines the issues are very narrow, and streight▪ of the one &amp; other side enuironed high with mountains, first called the ports of Arme∣nia, afterwards the mountains of Caspie, &amp; presently of Silicia: through which narrow streights, Alexander the great going in∣to the East parties, with great perilles and daungerous hazard, made his armie to passe. The principall and Metropolitan ci∣tie of this coūtrie is Tharse▪ vulgarely called Terrase, being the place of birth and houshold of S. Paul, which first was founded by the noble Perseus sonne of the faire Danae. Although Solin, and pope Pius attribute her first edification vnto Sardanapal the last sonne of Anacindaraxe, and last king of the Assyrians: through the midst of the same Countrie runneth the fayre ri∣uer Cydne or Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, by the Frēchmē called the riuer of Salef, which takes her spring from the mount of Taur and wherein was drowned the Emperour Frederike Barberosse. Vitruuius in his eight book and third chapter saith, that if they did wash their legs within this riuer Cydne, that incontinent after they should finde them selues cleansed and healed of their disease. The Tarsians were in times past so giuen to philosophie, that they excelled the Athenians and Alexandrians, notwithstan∣ding that the Athenians were more famous and renowmed in straunge countries, and that their Citie was more frequented
<PB REF="134" MS="y"/>
with al sorts of people. Neuerthelesse, the Tarsians were in phi∣losophy more excellent, and of their citie tooke origin, Anti∣pater, Archelaus, Antenor, Marcel, Diogenes, Artemidore, Dio∣nisius, and Crates the Grammarian. Besides Tarse the head ci∣tie of Cilicia, there is another renowmed citie of the auncients called Coryce, and of the modernes Curth, of all sides enuiro∣ned with a hauē of the sea, sauing of one side being very streight which ioyneth vnto the firme land. Aboue this citie there is an Antherne, a caue or denne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A caue very strange.</NOTE> which Pomponius Mela saith to be made by such singular artifice of nature, that the admiration, excellency, and soueraigne beautie thereof, carrieth those that enter into it out of their proper senses and memory and almost rauisheth and taketh awaye the spirites of those, whiche vp∣pon the sodaine enter intoo it. But after they are come to themselues, they cannot satisfie them of the pleasure which is there. For, for to come to the bottom of this heauenlike denne, you doe discend by a faire stare, about 3. quarters of a myle in∣delectable and shadowed, where is heard a harmony more then humaine, certaine sounds agreeing, &amp; sounding like vnto sym∣bals or other melodious instruments, which greatly abasheth and seemeth marueilous to those that firste enter into it. So as in times past the inhabitauntes of the countrie by super∣stitious, opinion did thinke, that this sounding caue was the se∣pulchrall bedde of the valiaunt Gyant Typhon. In the playne fieldes, which are about Coryce or Curth groweth abundance of very good saffron, giuing more smel, &amp; being more like vn∣to the colour of golde, and more profitable in medicines, then any other, &amp; hath for the singularitie thereof by the ancients been called saffron of Coryce. Tarse therefore and Coryce are two the most famous and renowmed Cities of Cilicia or Ca∣ramania, although there be diuers others of good and antique name, as Selimontis in the honour of the good Emperor Tra∣ian after his death consecrated in his name, and called Traia∣nopolis. There is also Satalia cituated vpon the sea coast of Ci∣licia, whereof hath taken the name the goulfe of Satalia, aun∣ciently called Issa, and presently Iasse: about this place Alexan∣der the Macedonian vanquished and ouercame the great Da∣rius

kyng of the Persians, by reason whereof the Citie was cal∣led Nicopolis, which is to say, towne of victory. Moreouer in the same region, is as yet resting the auncient towne of the Sun called Heliopolis, or to say better, Solos or Soloe, for that So∣lon one of the seuen sages of Grecia, was founder therof, and afterwardes by the name of Pompe was called Pompeiopolis, for that in the time of the triumphaunt Rome, the Cicilians dwelling along the coast of the Mediteran sea, a people beeing acquainted with the seas, &amp; exercising the nauigation, Pirates, Coursaries, and Skummers of the sea, stood vp in so great num∣ber, and so strong men giuen to piracie, &amp; of vessels and ships necessarie for that purpose, as Foysts, and Brigantins, that they possessed and kept the Sea side in such distresse, that they did not onely let and anoy the merchaunts shippes, and shippes of warre, but likewise kept the portes and passages so shutte, that they kept away the corne and victuals from all Italie, whereby the Romane people were in danger of being famished. Wher∣fore (as Flore writeth in his Epitome) Pompee was sent against them with an armie, which through marueilous diligence and speede within fortie dayes ouercame them, and chased them cleane out of the sea, and in the ende hauing on the land taken them into mercie, sent them into certaine townes and landes in Cilicia, farre from the Sea, there to dwell and liue, and too the ende to purge the sea: and namely assigned newe inhabi∣tants in the towne then called Soloe, and since vpon this rea∣son Pompeiopolis.</P>

Likewise, called after hys name theyr chiefe citie Tarse.

In this region (as Isidore saith) is the moūt Ararat, o∣therwise called the mount Gordian, vppon the toppe whereof rested and remained the arke of Noe, after the great deluge was ceassed.

Ptolo∣me in the first booke of his Geographie, &amp; pope Pius in his 3. part of <HI>y<SUP>e</SUP></HI> descriptiō of Asia, describe Armenia after this maner: on the North side it hath a part of Colcide, now called Calpurt of Hiberia and Albania: on the West it hath the great course of the riuer of Euphrates, which on the left hande leaueth Ca∣padocia▪ Armenia the lesser, Sira, Comegena, and towards the Euxine the mounts Mosquises. On the East it is termined with part of the Sea Hircanum, and of Media, toward the which are the Caspian mountes: and on the South side hath Mesopota∣mia and Assyria. The most famous mountaines of Armenia are the Mosquises, which stretch towardes Capadocia vppon the part of Periade, whereas are the springs of Euphrates, Araxes and Antitaure, which is the halfe part of the Euphrates, &amp; run∣neth through Media and Armenia, and at the ende of his course is called Albus: the Cordicque out of which the Tiger groweth and extendeth vnto the pales of Tospie the Taur, and the Niphante, whiche deuide Mesopotamia and Assyria from the Armenians, the Caspiens which decline to the Medes and the Caucases, whiche shut vp the North parts towards Iberia &amp; Albania▪ As for the riuers most renowmed in Armenia▪ the 4 principallest are these whiche followe: Cyrus which growing from the mount Caucase, leaueth on the left hande Iberia and Albania, and on the right hande Armenia, and so falleth into the Hircan Sea: Araxe, (which as wee haue sayde) falling from the mount Periade, taketh his course farre Eastwardes, after∣wardes enclineth towardes the North, and hauing runne so a great way, deuideth into two streames, whereof the one kee∣peth hys course Northwardes, and falleth into Cyrus, and the other towardes the East, casteth out into the Sea Caspium: the Euphrates whiche issueth out of the same mounte towardes the West, runneth vnto the Mountes of the Mosquice, and to the borders of Capadocia, and from thence taketh his course farre towardes the South, returnyng too Antitaure parteth the same from Armenia the lesser: afterwards taking his right

<P>THracia which first was called Perca, and since Scithon, is a prouince in Europe (counted amongst the regions of Sci∣thia, most ample and of great compasse, but of an yll tempera∣ture,
<PB REF="144" MS="y"/>
the ayre being vnwholesome, &amp; not healthfull, the ground also barren inough, except it be in the places neere vnto the sea. It was named Thracia, after the name of Thiras the sonne of Ia∣phet, or els as others say of Thrax the sonne of Mars, &amp; by thys reason (seeming to be the most apparant) was by Euripides cal∣led the house of Mars, at this present day is called Romaine, &amp; is diuided in 2. partes, the one wherof is called Thracia onely, and the other Thracia Chersonese. On the East part bordereth vpon the sea Exinum, and Propontide, on the south the Sea Ae∣geum, the floud, Strymon, presently Redino, &amp; the fields of Ma∣cedonia: on the North the riuer Istre, beeing the Danube or Danoe, and on the West the mountains of Peonia a part of Pan∣nonia, &amp; the riuer of Saue, as Plinie &amp; Strabo haue written, who doe affirme Thracia to be diuided by the mount Eme, and that the Triballes Dardanes (a fierce &amp; proude people) and the My∣siās inhabited Thracia, but the Triballes possessed the part pre∣sently kept by the Rastians, whom we do cal Seruians. After the Triballes are the Bulgares, from the East vnto the sea Euxinum, &amp; dwel between Istre and the mount Eme, extending towardes the south alongest the sea coast vnto Hellespontus, and is that which presently is called Romanie. The riuers of Thracia are, Bathynia, Athyras, Arsus, vulgarly Chiarelech, Melas, whereof taketh the name the gulph of Mela, otherwise the gulfe of Ca∣ridia, Hebrus now Matizza, or Valisa, Nesus or Neste, &amp; Strimō. But the most famous are the three last. Of the most renowmed mounts ye haue Eme, which separateth the Thracians from the Triballes, which by some hath byn called the chayne of the world. Rhodope, so called by Rhodope Queene of Thracia, out of which do spring the riuers Neste, &amp; Hebrus, &amp; the mount Orbel, much celebrated for the sacrifice of Bacchus▪ &amp; through the congregation of the Menades vnder the conduct of the Po∣et Orpheus. Amongst these mountaines Eme is of such a height that from the top therof (which as Pliny reciteth is 6000. paces) is seen the sea of Exinum: there is moreouer the mount Athos of the Latines called Monte santo, because it is altogether habi∣ted of the Caloeres, Greeks, which are (as most curiously wri∣teth M. Peter Bellon in his obseruation) in number 5, or 6. thou∣sand,

&amp; haue 23, or 24. monasteries al well fortified, for that they shuld not be molested of the Coursaries and Pirates on the sea, &amp; al these Caloieres liue vnder the obeysance of the Patri∣arch of Cōstantinople. This mount Athos is so high, that it pas∣seth the skies, so as diuers haue written that from thēce the sun shining, the shadow doth extend to the yle of Lemnos, being di∣stant one from another 70. M. pases. And neuertheles Xerxes the great king of the Persians, going against the Graecians, cau∣sed this mount to be cut through on the side that ioyneth vnto the firm land, making the sea to passe vnderneath it in such sort, that easily he made it round about nauigable▪ The Thraces (as Herodote in his 7 book writeth) haue the way whereby Xerxes passed his army, in such reuerence, that neuer since that time they would till or sow the same. Plutarch in the life of Alexan∣der the great, maketh mention of a certayne Stacicrates, an in∣genious maister, who being sent for, to come before the said A∣lexander, proposed vnto him that if his pleasure were, he would make to be cut in humain figure, the mount of Athos, with such art &amp; industry, that with his left hand, he should sustaine a Citie habitable for 10000. persons, &amp; with the right hād shuld powre out a great riuer: which should run down into the sea. But Alex∣ander taking it for a iest would not beleeue it. As for the cities of Thracia, the principallest and most ancientest are Bisia, some∣times the fortresse of the kings of Thracia, but odious vnto the swallowes for the detestable sinne of Thereus, Phinolopis, Cur∣nubisance, presently Pera or Galatha, &amp; Bizance, now Constan∣tinople, cituated vppon the Bosphore Thracian, (wherof I haue before made particular descriptiō.)

<P>ADrianopolis which sometimes was called Stratomcie, Odry¦sus and Trimuntium: vulgarly Andernople, Andernopoli or Andrinople, was a city most ample and faire, as by the auncient walles may be seene, her cituation is in a playne: but about, it hath many fruitful hilles. All the houses, except the auncient churches of the Christians, and the Mosquees and bathes of the Turkes, are builded after the Turkie fashion of wood and earth, Sultan Selim builded there for a dwelling place, a fayre and sumptuous Sarail, for that it was the place of his most resi∣dence: as also is of Sultan Soliman, that now reigneth, namely, in Winter, for the commodity of hunting, wherein hee greatly delighteth. There is besides another Sarail for the lodging of the Azamoglans or Ianissaries, but the fairest and most sumptu∣ous building of all is the Mosquee of Sultan Amarat: at one of the entries of the citie, ye passe ouer a great bridge of stone of Marbre, very high, on the one side wherof as also alongst by the Sarail passeth the riuer Hebrus, vulgarly called Matizza, and on the other side the Tuns, whiche riuers by the turning in their course haue made neere vnto the citie many faire &amp; prety yles, no lesse pleasant then profitable, as being trimmed and dressed into most faire orchardes (full of all sortes of excellent fruitfull trees) and delicious gardens. The citie is peopled with a great number of Christians Greekes hauing there their Metropoli: who hauing lost their liberty, and seeing them selues destitute and dispossessed of all they hadde, are retyred thither, some to giue themselues to some trade of merchandise or handicrafte. The other hauing yet left some meane to liue by, go vp &amp; down thinking of their former estates and degrees. There are likewise an infinite number of rich Iewes, and great traders, with mer∣chandise &amp; ready monie, to giue and deliuer out by grosse vpon excessiue vsury. But the number of the Turkes is the greatest of all, and specially of excellent woorkmen, which is the occasion that the city doth abound of all sortes of merchaundises, and

<P>AS concerning death, the opiniō among the Thrasiās was ve∣ry diuers, for some thought that the soule being departed out of the body, sodainly entred into another, or els if she retur¦ned not, did not therfore die, but passed into another life more sweet &amp; happy thē was the first. Others with great pertinacy af∣firmed, that the soule died with the body, but y<SUP>t</SUP> such death was better then a life ful of bitternes &amp; perplexity. And vppon this occasion the Trauces, a people of Thracia, did at the birth of their childrē, with weeping<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crying, &amp; sighing, lamēt their com∣ming into the world, pitifully rehearsing the trauels and cala∣mities which they had to suffer in this miserable world, during the smal course of their life: &amp; to the contrary if anye of them came to die, they brought them to their graue with all kind of plaies &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eastings, reciting &amp; singing altogether, the euils, tor∣ments &amp; aduersities, wherof by the tribute of death, they were deliuered. For like as man is borne of a woman in dolor &amp; an∣guish: so he liueth in miserie and calamity vnto the ende of his daies: &amp; for that they had many wiues, if any of them came to dye, they fell in great discord the one with the other, to knowe which of them had bin the best beloued, and she to whom the honour &amp; praise was adiudged, was of al men greatly honored, and afterwards being by her next parents brought vnto the se∣pulture of her husband, clothed &amp; set out with her richest gar∣mēts, was there buried by him. And as for the other wiues, they brought ouer the rest of their life in mourning and displeasure, as if some great misfortune had bin happened vnto them. But when it came to passe some nobleman to be buried, the body
<PB N="146" REF="150" MS="y"/>
was buryed for three dayes, about the citie, sacrificing al sorts of beastes, and then after a great feast made, consumed the bo∣die into ashes, and that beeing done, set foorth all sortes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur∣noyes and cumbates in honour of the deceassed. When the Thratians perceiued it thunder or lighten, incontinently they shoote their arrowes towards heauen, threatning of their god, for they thought that there was none other God then theirs, whiche was Zomolixis, beeing the firste that instituted them lawes to draw them to ciuilitie, such as he had seene by the Io∣nians, being with the philosopher Pithagoras, vnto whom hee had been a disciple: and did besides commonly worship Mars, Bacchus, and Diana, &amp; did sweare by the onely name of Mer∣curie, whom they had in great honour and reuerence for that they esteemed themselues to be descended of him. Their kings weare chosen by the voyce of the people, and not by nobilitie and aboue all thinges had a regard, that he should be of a ripe age of good lyfe and manhood, and that he hadde no children, for feare least in the end the kingdome should come to an he∣reditarie succession.

Epire goeth euen to A∣drie, in these regions the places &amp; cities farre from the Sea, the most notable, and that doe merite to be set out, are Thessalia, Thessalonique &amp; Larisse, anciently Iolque, in Magnesie, Antro∣nie, in Phiotide Phithie, in Locree, Syne, and Calliacre. Plinie in hys fourth booke, the first chapter, sayth, that the Locrians haue been called Ozoles. In Phocide, is the citie of Delphe, ci∣tuated at the foote of the mount Parnasus, and watered wyth the riuer Cephisusi: within the same citie was in times paste a temple, within the which Phoebus or Apollo, the God of deui∣nation according to the errour of the auncients was worship∣ped. In Beoce, Thebes, whiche at this present hath but a little castle stibes, and Citheree, muche celebrated by the fables of the Poets, and in Atticque, is Eluse, consecrated vnto Ceres. But the most renowmed citie of all Grecia is Athens, whiche was builded by Cecrops Diphies, beeing in the dayes of Moses, which called it Cecropia: afterwardes was called Mopsophie of Mopsus, and Ionie the sonne of Ion, the sonne of Xuthe, or els as Iosephus reciteth of Ianus the sonne of Iaphet: &amp; final∣ly of Minerua, for the Greciās called Minerua, Athene, she was the inuentour of all good artes, and industrious liberall scien∣ces, mother &amp; nurse of diuers excellent Philosophers, Orators, and Poets, which through their labors and memorable works, haue gotten immortal praise. But by chaunge of time and vn∣stedfastnesse of fortune this so flourishing a citie is brought to such extremitie &amp; ruine, that at this present there is nothing of estimation left of it, but a little castle, which is called Sethi∣ne, builded on the leauinges of the walles of the auncient and renowmed temple of Minerua. In Migare otherwise called Niscee, is the Citie of Megare, in whiche was borne Euclide, prince of the Geometrians, and thys Cytie gaue the name vntoo the prouince, as Argus dyd in Argos. In Argolide is Argos and Micene, and the temple of Iuno muche renowed

aswell for antiquitie as deuotion. In Laconie is Terapne, La∣cedemone (the seate and habitation of the king Agamemnon) which also was called Sparthe of Sparthus, the son of Phoro∣neus, but presently is called Mysithra. Ther is likewise Amicde, distant twentie stadias from Lacedemon, a country abounding of all good and excellent frutefull trees and other goods, and in the same is the temple of Apollo the most excellent of all o∣thers in that countrie, aswell in riches as cunning building, set in that quarter of the towne, which is towards the sea and the mount Tayget. In Messenia, Messene, and Methon, or Modon, at the siege whereof Philip king of Macedonie, father of Alex∣ander the great lost one of his eyes, with the shot of an arrowe. In Achie is, Pise of Oenomae, Elis, &amp; the Olimpiā tēple of Iupi∣ter, much renowmed because of the Olimpian games, and tho rowe singular deuotion, and a great deale more, because of the excellencie of the image made by the hands of Phydias. Arca∣die is rounde about enuironed of the Peloponesians, and her principall cities are Psefe, Tenie, and Orcomene. The mountes Pholoe, Cillene, Parthene, and Menale: the ryuers Erimanthe, and Ladoen. In Arcadia greatlye florished Prometheus the sonne of Iapetus, who being a man of deep knowledge taught the rude menne to liue ciuillie, hee inuented the natural pour∣tractes with the fatte earth, and was also the firste that stroke fire out of the flint stone, and that taught the Grecians Astro∣logie and therefore the poets doe faine that hee helde vp the heauen. In Etolie is Naupacte vulgarely Lepanto or Epacto. In Acarnania presently called Ducte or Ducat, or Duche, the castle Strate. In Epire is the temple of Iupiter Dodone, and the sacred fountayne, whiche is of such a vertue, that putting into it any burning thing: is sodainly extinguished: but putting into it a bundle of straw, it is foorthwith set on fire. Passing be∣younde the coastes of the promontorie Sepie, by Demetrie, Boic, Pitheleon and Echine, is the passage towardes the gulfe of Pagase, whiche hauing imbraced or enuironed the Citie of Pagase, receiueth into hys hauen the ryuer Sperchie, and this place is renowmed for that the Minies accōpaning Iason when he went to Colchos to conquer the golden fleese, did there go

The mountaines are so high that it seemeth almost a thing impossible to get vppe vnto them, but betweene both, there is a valley about threescore paces wide, by the which onely yee can get vp vnto them: through which means these mountainnes haue been called Pyles, which is to say, portes, and by reason of the whot waters that runne out of the same Thermopyles. They were so renowmed by the great discomfitures of the Persians done by the Greekes vnder the conduct of the valiant Leonidas the Laconian, who brauelye withstoode the impetuositie and furor of Xerxes, but in our time they haue not been able to resist or shut vppe the passage vnto the Turkes, of whō all the Grecians haue been ouercome &amp; subued. It hath againe Scatphie Cnemides, Alope, &amp; Larym∣ne. Besides Aulide, wher the assembling of the army, was made by Agamemnon and other princes of Grecia after the league by them made to goe to the siege of Troy. There is also Mara∣thon, a true testimonie of diuers noble prowesses<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> celebrated since the victorie of Theseus, and by the great foyle which the armie of the Persians receiued there. yee haue moreouer there Rhamne, a little citie, but famous, because of the temple of Amphia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aus, and the Nemesis of Phidias.

Sunio is a promontorie bor∣dering and running along by the sea side of Hellade or Grece, on the side that is towardes the East, and from thence vnto Me∣gare a citie of Atticke, doth turne towardes the South.

There is the castle Cenchree, the temple of Neptune and the famous games called Istmetiques, instituted by Theseus vpon enuie of those which Hercules had instituted in Olimpe. Corinthe which in time passed was so no∣table of riches, first builded by a Brigand called Sisiphe the son of Eolus in the foure score yeare of the age of Moses, and was called Corcyre or Certhyre and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terwardes Ephire, after that she was augmented, was ruined and builded againe by Corin∣thus the sonne of Orestes or Iupiter, which after his name cal∣led it Corinthe, whiche signifieth administration or publicque safegarde, and since was againe destroyed by the Romans, and restored by Auguste Caesar, within this citie of Corinthe there was somtimes a temple of great beautie &amp; excellēcie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dedicated vnto the Goddesse Venus, to whom belonged aboue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1000. whores of renowne dedicated to this goddesse according too the Heathen custome, which were common vnto all commers.

Frō the most high towre of the for∣tresse, called Acrocorinthe, are seene both the seas, to wit, of Io∣nie and Egee.

In Assine is the riuer Pamis∣se, and in the Ciparissenne Alphee. And euery one of these are called after the names of the Cities, cituated vpō the sea coast. Cilene and Callipoli, are vpon the riuer of Patras, which aun∣ciently was called Aroe, in which place Saint Andrewe an apo∣stle of Iesus Christ, receiued the crowne of his martirdome.

In this prouince are the townes Action, Argy, Amphiloche, Ambratie and Buthroton, vulgarelye Butrinto, the royall citie of Aeacides and Pirrhus. The Partheneans and Dessaretes vsed for their habitation the first countries, amongest which the principall townes are, Ori∣que and Dirrachium, by the auncients called Epidamne, but the Romanes chaunged the name thereof, for that it seemed vnto them almost à Malum Auguriū, &amp; an vnhappie encounter to them that went thither, because that Damnum in their lan∣guage signifieth damage.

<P>LYcurgus perceiuing the Lacedemonians to liue without a∣ny honest form of pollicie was the first that instituted lawes vnto them, hauing first abolished all the corrupted customes, which they had before amongst them. First, he confirmed the people in the obeysance of their princes, and the princes to the true iustice of the Empyres, through the meane of a Senate of 28.

He tooke away and abolished al kinds of money, of siluer and golde: and insteed thereof made yron to be coyned: which notwithstan∣ding he made to be tempered and extinguished being red hot in vineger, to the intent to make it soft: &amp; by that meanes, to be vnfit for all other woorkes: he banished out of Lacedemon all handicrafts and artes not necessary, and instituted banquets &amp; common feasts, to the intent to refraine superfluity and daynti∣nesse: vnto which aswel the poore as the rich were called &amp; wel∣commed, both with one place and one kinde of meate &amp; they called these banquets Phiditia &amp; by the Candiots were named Andria he forbad the often attempting of warres agaynst ones self party or enemies, for feare least they should be constrained often to defend themselues, and in the end become valiaunt and good fighters, he commaunded that the maydens should exercyse them selues to runne, wrastle, cast the dart and throw the barre, to make them through such exercise: the more strong &amp; able to beare children, and when there was any great feast

<P>AS for the Athenians, Iustine in his 12. booke reciteth, that they were the first that taught the art of spinning of wooll, making of wines and oyles, to plow the ground, &amp; to sow corn: for at the first they fed on nothing but on acornes, &amp; for theyr dwellings had none other lodgings, thē litle cabbins &amp; caues. Doxius was the first that builded houses in Athens, which (fol∣lowing therin the maner of the swalows) he builded of earth. In the daies of Deucalion, Cecrops raigned as king ouer the Athe∣nians, &amp; is he whom the Poets haue fayned to haue 2. forheads because he was the first that ioyned the men &amp; the women by the right line of mariage. After him succeeded Granaus, which had a daughter called Athis▪ which gaue the name vnto the re∣gion. After that reigned Amphitrion, which first cōsecrated the citie vnto the goddesse Minerua, &amp; named it Athene. In his time was the great flood &amp; inundation of the waters, which marred and drowned the most part of Grecia, &amp; in this great deluge, were only saued those that could get vp to the mountaines▪ or the other which were cōueyed towards Deucaliō king of Thes∣salia. By whom according to the feinings of the Poets, the world was by order of succession restored. The kingdome being since come vnto Eristheus, during his reigne the sowing of corne was brought in &amp; inuented in Eleusine by Triptolemus, &amp; therfore in remembrance of this good thing the nights were sacred vn∣to him. The Athenians being esteemed the wisest amongst the Graecians (for that the administration of their common wealth

was gouerned by the sage &amp; wise doctrines of the Philosophers) made a lawe that to euery one of them it was permitted to take two wiues, but thereby were streightly forbidden to keepe any concubine, saying it to be a thing without all honesty, to keepe other mennes wiues, and to giue vnto his owne an yll exam∣ple of liuing. And this they did for the opinion which they had that a man could not liue without women and company: and when the one was brought to bed or sick he might go vnto the other, or els if the one were barren the other might be fit to bring forth children and succession, and to her that was fitt to conceaue, the gouernement and administration of the house was giuen, and the barren woman was vnto him as a seruaunt. Plinie is one of his Epistles saith, that the Athenians were wont to marry the brother with the sister, but not the Vncle with the nephew, alledging for his reason, that the marriage of a brother with the sister was an euen match: but the Vncle with the ne∣phew was the marrying of the olde with the young.</P>

Notwithstanding, the bettet to prouide for the weake∣nesse of the people: he permitted vnto euery one that would, to take in hand the quarrel of him that had bin wronged. Aboue the counsel of the Areopages, which he had established, he set a∣nother second coūsel of 100 men, for the matters of estate, whi∣che he did choose out of euery degree, wherof 4. were chosen to consult vpon matters before they were proponed vnto the peo¦ple.

But after the discō∣fiture of the Persians, through the maruellous increase of their power, they fell into such a vainglory &amp; arrogancy (euen as at al times pride and presumption are accustōmed to accompanye great prosperities) that in place of most honest gouernment, which they had in their common wealth: they gaue thēselues to a life disordered, corrupted, and ful of al villany, and abho∣minable dissolution: wherupon ensued, that during the time of this monarchy, the Graecians had between themselues many great &amp; long warres: yea such, as in the end, this so noble Grae∣cia was altogether ruined and destroyed: for euery one attēp∣ting vpon it of al sides, was in the end giuen as a pray vnto all strangers.

<P>THe same Graecians, through their marueilous industry and subtlety of spirite, were inuenters of many monstrous man∣ners of superstition and idolatry, for euery one of them had their God, prayers, and ceremonies proper vnto themselues. Iu∣piter was honored amongst them for a remedy of stormes and tempests, Mars for to eschew the perils and fortune of warres. They honoured Iuno for to get riches, Pallas to obtayne wise∣dome, and Venus for to haue discent, &amp; a 1000 like follies whi∣che amongst them were obserued, so as they fell into such infa∣my, that in the end they established their solemne feasts impure and vnhonest: at the which it was vnto euery one indifferently permitted, vnder pretext of religion and holinesse, to rauish &amp; defloure women and maydens: such were the braue solemni∣ties of their false gods, by the Graecians aunciently obserued vnder colour of religion, and so deeply were their hearts drow∣ned in errour and idolatry most abhominable, through igno∣rance of true vnderstanding, and knowledge of the most high∣est Lord. Cecrops▪ of whom before mētion is made, was the first amongst them that called on God vnder the name of Iupiter, who inuented the images, and dressed the altars for to offer sa∣crifices. And Orpheus was he which produced and celebrated the first sacrifices vnto Liber Pater in the mountaine Boetia, neer vnto Thebes, wheras Liber Pater was born. Wherfore they were called Orpheique, and in the same Orphee was after∣wardes taken and torne in peeces. And likewise amongest the Thebans, the Eagle was in opinion thought to be of such diui∣nity, that because she did flie so high, they supposed her to haue some communication with God. The Athenians also had their religion in such honour and reuerence, that they banished out of their city the Philosopher Diagoras, for that he durst write, that he doubted whether there were any goddes, and if there were any, what kind of ones they might be. These also condem∣ned

the wise Socrates, for the suspitious opinion they had in him, that he would haue brought into their citie a new religi∣on, which Socrates when it was reported vnto him, that the A∣thenians had condemned him to die: and they (quoth he) are vndoubtedly condemned by nature. Behold, thus haue yee the auncient maner of liuing and religion of the Graecians.</P>

<P>ABout the time that the sauiour of the world suffered death and passion on the crosse, with his own blood to buy again the sinne of our first father, the true religion and knowledge of God began to shew and take roote amongst the Graecians, tho∣row the meanes of the holy preachings of the disciples and A∣postles of Iesus Christ, namely, by the Apostle S. Paule, whiche by diuine inspiration in Thessalonia, Athens, Corinth and A∣chaia, preached and announced Christ to be the true Messias, and through many godly miracles, so multiplied the christiani∣ty, that in the end, leauing their dānable superstition, the woor∣shipping and calling on their false gods (which so long time had held them in obscurity and dark damnation) they acknowled∣ged their faults, &amp; opened their eies to take the right tast of the light to eternall saluation, wherein they haue alwaies persisted, vntil such time, as through the inuention &amp; cursed venim of Sa∣than, they fel (in succession of time) into many errors &amp; damna∣ble heresies, as into that of the Manicheans, which affirmed that there were 2. goddes, the one good and the other euill, whiche both were eternal, that Iesus Christ was not the true God. They boasted also that they could giue the holy ghost, they forbade marriages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heresie of Donatus.</NOTE> &amp; al superior puissāce▪ &amp; as for the books of the apo∣stles, they wold by no means beleue in thē, but made doctrines of themselues, which they called gospels of Iesus Christ. They were also infected with Donatus sects, which said the sonn to be lesse thē the father, &amp; the holy ghost lesse thē God &amp; the sonne:
<PB N="159" REF="163" MS="y"/>
afterwardes following the heresie of Nestor Bishop of Con∣stantinople, affirmed that the virgin Marie was not the mother of God, but only the mother of a man, in placing two persons the one humane and the other diuine: with the heretike Euti∣ches Abbot in Constantinople, said the diuinitie to be with the humanitie, &amp; consequently from the time of Constantin the Emperor, they stuck vnto the infected heresie of Arrius, which was no lesse pestiferous then other, for they taught that Iesus Christ was not borne naturally God, &amp; diuers other most blas∣phemous things more amply wiritten in the first book of The∣odorete Bishop of Cyropolis, wherby in the end through god his myraculous worke, the authour of the same sect was puni∣shed according to his deseruings for being pressed in his belly as he was going to the stoole he burst through the middest of his bellie and so died miserably, and notwithstanding that all their errours haue been reiected and conuinced by many Sy∣nodes and Councels<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet doe they at this present erre in many things from our faith, for they maintaine that the holy Ghost proceedeth from the father and not from the sonne▪ they doe nothing agree with the Latines, for they will by no meanes ac∣knowledge the Pope of Rome to be the head of their churche and much lesse doe esteeme his commaundements. But to the contrary doe say that the Popes (whom they esteeme with all their adherents, as heretikes and schismatiks) haue corrupted and violated the gospels and other bookes of our religion, to adde or take away that which seemed good vnto them, for to serue their insatiable and damnable auarice. Moreouer they say themselues too bee the first that were conuerted vnto the faith, and that because they beleeue purely and simply the true traditions of the primitiue churche, as by the Apostles it was preached &amp; anounced vnto thē. They haue foure patriarches in foure seueral prouinces, which do command &amp; haue power of the orientall churches, whereof the first &amp; principall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is hee which is at Constantinople vnto whom as vnto their chiefe su∣periour, they doe obey with all honour &amp; reuerence.

Empire, yea and ouer the Muscouites. The se∣cond recedith at Caire, &amp; hath vnder him Egipt &amp; Arabia. The third cōmandeth ouer Iudea, Damas, Barut, &amp; Tripoli in Suria, keepeth his seat at Ierusalem. The fourth &amp; last hath his place of aboad in the citie of Antioch, and hath puissaunce ouer the Greciā church of Suria. These Patriarches are chosen &amp; created by the Metropolitans of the prouinces as the popes are by the Cardinals, &amp; aboue all things they haue a regarde to choose a∣mongst thē those which they think to be of a perfect age, wit∣tie, manfull &amp; holy of life. And notwithstanding they haue the ful power &amp; autoritie ouer their churches, yet do they not pos∣sesse either townes, castels or fortresses, nor yet doe entertaine men of war or archers for the gard of their persons. They doe not also apparrel thēselues in cloth of gold, purple veluet, crim¦sin sattin, or any other cloth of silk, but do liue in all simplicitie &amp; modestie, hauing none other reuenew, for their entertaine∣ment or liuing, bookes &amp; apparrel, thē about the sum of 200. d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cates a yeere, which are ordeined &amp; distributed vnto thē by the churches, ouer which they do cōmaund, &amp; their garmentes are nothing different nor more rich, thē those of a simple mōk, whom they do call Caloier, but that vpon their head insteed of a three crowned myter, they do weare a great felt hat, wherup∣on is laid a large band of cloth of gold crosse wise. Their priests did weare long beards, &amp; were marryed to one woman onely, which comming to die they might not marrie another, and if they were found in adultery, they were punished by their supe∣riors without any mercy. They do celebrate the masse in their vulgare lāguage to the intent to bee vnderstanded of all men, and cōmunicate the L. supper vnder two kinds, &amp; do it indiffe∣rently aswell vnto the great as lesser sort. They do not put any water into their wine: they deny the purgatory, &amp; say, that prai¦ers, fastings &amp; almes do nothing help the souls of the disceased &amp; wil not suffer any carued images of saints in their churches, but on flat pictures painted. These patriarches haue besides an other custom very strāge, which is that euery yere on the good friday, they do anathemise &amp; excōmunicate the pope &amp; al prin¦ces &amp; christiā people obeying vnto the traditions of the Rom▪ church. They do obserue two Lents with great abstinence, wher of the first beginneth on the fat mūday, being ix▪ dayes before
<PB N="160" REF="164" MS="y"/>
the lēt of the Latins, &amp; during these ix. daies, they may eat egs, cheese and fish: but after that, vntil Easter they doe abstayn frō al kind of fishes and other meat that hath blood in it. The other Lent they do solemnise in the time of the Aduent, &amp; thē do fast 40. dayes with like abstinence as at the first. And finally, they haue many other ceremonies farre different from the Romaine Church, and although in their religion they do obserue many good things, yet do they in many things differ much from the primitiue Church, I meane such as haue bin taught vs by the A∣postles. By reason of which their errors, as for diuers other vy∣ces, wherwith they haue bin &amp; are entangled: it is not to be mar∣ueiled at, though this Graecian nation, which hath byn the most flourishing in al Europe, aswel in gouernment of cōmon wealth as administration of iustice, good policy, ful of excellēt captains and good souldiers &amp; expert philosophers, yea that rightly it might haue byn called the iust spring, and fountaine of all phy∣losophy and liberall sciences: and now through the variable course of nature, &amp; vnstedfastnes of fortune, the most desart, barbarous &amp; desolated countrey, habitable on earth▪ as beyng fallen into ignominious calamity, and miserable seruitude vn∣der those that are more barbarous. For besides the great vyces wherin first they were so deepe drowned, being in the chiefe of their monarchie and magnificēce, after they had ouercome the Persians, feeling themselues riche &amp; puissant because of suche a spoile, they fel into such pride &amp; presumption, that not being a∣ble to liue in peace one with another, had between them many long &amp; cruel warres, vppon which followed the ruine, saccage∣ment, &amp; desolation of their coūtrey, burning of their cities, cru∣el murthering of their anciēt citizēs, &amp; other inestimable losses. So as by the same, Graecia was altogether destroied, marred and ouerthrown, yea that after, it was set as a pray &amp; opē passage to those y<SUP>t</SUP> wold inuade y<SUP>e</SUP> same, &amp; in the end frō honest cōmō weal∣thes, &amp; politike gouernmēt, the inhabitāts were brought vnder tirāny, &amp; forthwith vnder kingdōs. And after they had remaind vnder the subiectiō &amp; obeisance of the romain empire, vnto the last Cōstantin for making vp of their last calamities, by diuyne permission &amp; for punishmēt of their vices &amp; detestable sinnes, after they had lost their Emperour and the imperiall citie of

These wretched Graecians are left vnder the mi∣serable seruitude of these miscreated Mahometists, constrained to insupportable tributes, yea to pay the tenth person of their owne children, as before in the description of the Azamoglans I haue declared: such are the righteous iudgements of GOD towards the misbeleeuing, and those that abuse his gracious gifts.</P>
