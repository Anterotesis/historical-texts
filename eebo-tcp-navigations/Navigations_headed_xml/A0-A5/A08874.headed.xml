<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Auing framed this discourse long since for
mine owne aduertisement, what might and
ought to be done by Trauaile; and now consi∣dering
the manifould errors and misprisions,
that the greater sort of such as trauaile into
forraine Countries, haue heretofore commit∣ted
(because these dayes wherein we now liue
are no lesse disordered, then when pilgrimages were on foote) and how
few haue arriued vnto that perfectiō which was requirable, for the wāt
of a Guide or Counsellor, to aduise &amp; aduertise them of the fairer and
more readie way, to make their trauailes somewhat more profitable and
honorable: I haue been encouraged (worthy Reader) vpō the vertue
of the yonger sort of such noble gentlemen as intend so recōmendable a
course, to prepare and addresse the same, by way of Essay; the rather
also for that, in other languages, I haue suruayed some of like proiect,
for other Nations, who I am sure stand not more in neede then wee in
this State doe. Protesting (as in the inferiornesse of the stile may well
appeare, that neither vanitie of glorie, nor selfe presumption (being of
many the most vnworthie to haue enterprised this taske) nor other pri∣uate
respect then dutie to my good friends (that haue requested this at
my hands) and Zeale to my louing Countriemen, hath made me pub∣lish
it. For, considering of all voluntarie Commendable actions, that
of trauailing into forraine States (vndertaken and performed Regu∣larly)
is the most behoueable &amp; to be regarded in this Common-weale,
both for the publike and priuate good thereof, singularly also for that
the same is not vndergone with ordinarie charge, care, hazard, or ta∣king
of paines, but of most vncertaine issue and commoditie to Tra∣uailers:
It seemeth vnto mee (vertuous Reader) a faire dutie
(where other worthie men haue beene so long silent, in giuing a per∣fect
rule for Trauailing, as it is in vse at this day) to begin the hew∣ing
out of one, that by some master workeman, it may hereafter be bet∣ter
planted, formed, and tried.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
Moreouer, I thought good, for the informatiō of some Readers, to vn∣couer
my intent in sundrie points therin cōtained. And first, that wher∣as
diuers other sortes of Trauailers are mentioned thē those Generall
Voluntaries, (for whom this discourse was framed) they are <HI>honoris
gratia, &amp; obiter Salutati;</HI> and rather by way of order, then worthie
to receiue direction, mentioned. Secondly, that whereas by the found of
some words, some people and Nations may thinke they be taxed in cer∣taine
points, notwithstanding therein I may say, <HI>Nihil iam quod
non prius ab omnibus dictum fuit:</HI> yet I trust, the honest Reader
will perceiue may meaning to bend rather to the rectifying, then preiudi∣cing
of any. Thirdly, where any point is obserued by way of secreat or
policie, that no other Construction be made thereof, then the literall,
to ensample and aduance knowledge. Fourthly, that considering for
the priuate respect of the most vnexpert, more Minute Subdiuisions
and points are cōtained, then per aduenture will rellish with the taste of
some; that such will take for their better stomacke the benefit of those
Marginall notes, which for their sakes I haue set downe. Lastly, see∣ing
not only we here in <HI>England</HI> may, as all other Nations in the world
doe, account it a shame that there should be so many and such fugitiues
(vnworthie of the honourable name of Trauailers) as this Land hath
affourde hertofore, who haue not afterwards made conscience of their
owne wayes nor of others, but like the most pernitious haue communi∣cated
with all euill and mischiefe in their trauailes, to subiect their own
Countrie, Princes, State, Parents, friends and all that is held deare in
this life; let me discouer so much of my secretest affections vnto thee
(discreet Reader) that the preuenting hereof, was one of the first mo∣tiues
to vndertake this worke. And so I heartily pray to God to make
thee happie in all vertue and godlinesse, and to set to thy helping hand,
as much as in thee lyeth, to encounter that imputation to our Countrie:
leauing vnto thy discreete iudgement, moreouer, these Tables which
are here abstracted for the ease and aide of mens memories. And
so I bid thee farwell. From <HI>Wingham,</HI> the first of <HI>Iulie.</HI> 1606.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Onsidering with what libertie and
Applause, Princes, in times past,
vndertook voluntarie trauaile &amp;
aduentures into forraine parts:
and how of latter dayes those
Illustrious Stemmes of noble∣nesse
(<HI>I</HI> know not now by what custome restrai∣ned
of that recreation and renowne) haue not∣withstanding
improued their pretious times at
home vnto no lesse rent of commoditie &amp; com∣mendablenes,
by suffering themselues to be tray∣ned
vp and delighted in the faculties and know∣ledge
of diuine and humane things: I haue pre∣sumed
(most excellent and gratious Prince) hum∣bly
to prefer, vnto your rare protectiō and view,
<PB REF="5"/>
this Essay, of the means how to make the trauailes
of other men (who for the good of this kingdom
wherein they liue so happily, their better seruice
to his Maiestie, and making of themselues more
Compleat in all things, haue faire libertie &amp; de∣sire
to aduenture trauaile) somewhat more profi∣table
and honorable, not only before trauaile, but
in the <HI>interim</HI> of trauaile, and after their returnes.
First, because your highnesse is (in all happie pos∣sibilitie)
to be a most noble Iudge of all mens de∣serts
in this point, rather then to make experience
your selfe therin, vnlesse in Martial causes: wherin
<HI>I</HI> know not whether <HI>I</HI> may account your royall
Auncestors (Princes of this State) to bee more
happie alwaies in their good successe, or in the
faithfulnesse of their voluntarie great traines. Se∣condly,
for that the people of great <HI>Britaine</HI> (of
all other famous and glorious Nations separated
from the maine Continent of the world) are by
so much the more interessed to become Trauai∣lers,
by how much the necessitie of euerie seuerall
estate of men doth require that, for their better
aduancement. Lastly, in regard this subiect hath
not worne an English habite hertofore, (from the
custom dew to Princes in the Novelty of things)
<HI>I</HI> thought it my dutie (vnder the compasse of my
obligation and seruice vnto your Highnesse) to
make a present hereof (although but meanly ap∣parelled
and suited) and in most humble wise to
<PB REF="5"/>
beseech the greatnesse of your Excellencie, to
fauour &amp; patronize the same. Which gratiousnes
<HI>I</HI> must euer acknowledge (sir) to proceede from
the cleare fountain of your generous, ingenuous,
and princely disposition vnto all bountie, good∣nesse
and vertue: and the world alreadie knowes,
that your singular towardlines, to euerie good &amp;
perfect thing, is such, that neither can it or is like∣ly
to be paralleled of any in the world (so long as
your Highnesse continews in these religious ver∣tuous
&amp; studious paths, which God graunt) nor
circumscribed within the Kings most Ample
kingdomes, and States, but is knowen, feared, or
admired in forrain parts. The which as it is a most
Soueraine and inexpressible blessing vnto all, of
these his Maiesties Dominions: So, vnto mee, it
shal be the onely studie &amp; care to make expressiō
of all dutifull alleageance: And in the meane
seafō to pray vnto God cōtinually for your high∣nesse,
to continue for euer in health, felicitie and

which is the efficient of all good things in a secret man∣ner)
that ought to stirre vp men to trauell from their
Countrie (which as a parent tyeth all in duetie to respect
it before sorteine parts: and wherein euerie one ought
to leade his life godly and soberly, to aduance the
Common-weale thereof.) Those are first the plea∣sure
of the prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The princes pleasure.</NOTE> or State, or Law vnder which men
liue. The second in number, though in order preferable
aboue all things in the world, is the maintenance and
exercise of true Religion and Godlinesse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mainte∣nance of Reli∣gion.</NOTE> The
third is a godly thought to do good in the Church and
Common-weale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hope to do good in the Church and Common-weale.</NOTE> grounded either vpon probable rea∣son,
or vndertaken for priuate necessitie and respect.
Seeing the two former belong either to <HI>Non voluntarie</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
or <HI>Inuoluntarie</HI> trauellers, it shall bee the more sparing∣ly
discoursed of them; in regarde the <HI>Voluntarie</HI> are the
the true subiects of our point in hand.</P>
<P>The Persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non Volunta∣ries</HI> duple.</NOTE> first occasioned to trauell by the Prin∣ces
or States fauour, are either men of peace, or men of
warre. Those of peace are either honorable or not,
according to the circumstances of places, persons and
times to whom and in what times they are sent. The
honourable be either Embassadors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honorable <HI>Non Voluntaries. Non Voluntaries</HI> not honorable.</NOTE> Commissioners, or
Messengers with or without credence. The not hono∣rable
be Postes and such like Currers necessarie in
States to aduertise Princes speedily concerning their
mindes, or such as goe vnder the name of Intelligen∣cers.</P>
<P>As cōcerning the honourable, though the prouidence
of euerie Prince State make election of meete per∣sonages
to vndergoe such charge as is committed vn∣to
them; and are euer well instructed concerning prin∣cipall
matters and momentall: yet for other mens ob∣seruations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue circum∣stāces required of the honora∣ble <HI>Non Volun∣taries.</HI></NOTE>
there are fiue circumstāces required of these
principall Trauellers, to bee considered. First, from
whom such are sent. Secondly, to whome and to what
gouernement. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> what is their Embassage in spe∣ciall.
Fourthly, what they themselues are, so chosen to
vndergoe the office of Embassadors, of Commissioners
or Messengers. And fiftly, that the States of those Coū∣tries
&amp; fashiō of the people, as welfrom whence as vnto
which they are sent, be pondered at the time of their le∣gation:
which shal enable thē the more to be answerable
in all points of cōsequencie; that the Prince sending may
be cōpleatly serued &amp; honored; that the State or Prince,
to whome, may accordingly admire and haue the
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Embassage and them in recommendation, that the Em∣bassage
may take best effect. And lastly, that no reproche
chance vnto them either concerning their traines or
themselues, but contrariwise commendation &amp; reward.
Moreouer it is required of such that they be eloquent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vertues and faculties, requi∣red in Amba∣ssadours.</NOTE> to
obtaine and efect that which they plead for in negoti∣ations:
prudent in accusing, excusing, demanding, de∣nying,
and such like politicke affaires: liberall, honest,
humane, popular, but with respect, ciuile in words and
ceremonies, faithfull aboue all, carefull to dispatch af∣faires,
and painefull to ripen and prepare them, and last∣ly
obseruant in forreine affaires to get intelligēce. These
may be sufficient at this present.</P>
<P>As touching the not honorable, though wee might
be also silent &amp; passe thē ouer for the reasō aforesaid,
yet let these things be remembred.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Postes.</NOTE> First, that Postes,
whether mediatly, or immediatly, be speedy and faithful
to put in execution things committed to their charge.
Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intelligencers.</NOTE> as concerning Intelligencers and Referen∣daries,
being persons of notable esteeme to support the
policie of the Estate by the knowledge of the secrets of
forreine powers and daily occurrences that chaunce in
them. Wherby Princes may shew all offices vnto their
friends and confederates, and be sufficiently armed with
knowledge to resist the malice of their enemies or en∣counter
such as are held in iealousie.</P>
<P>These are sent out by the mediation of the Councell
in most States, or by some of the principall. Of these In∣telligencers
it is required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pointes requi∣red in Intelli∣gencers.</NOTE> first before their vndergoing
so dangerous an actiō, To speak singularly the tongues,
that may stand them in stead in that Countrey out of
which they must gather intelligence, and to imitate the
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
common gestures and behauiour of those nations, to
cloke their purposes the more artificially. Also to bee
well accōmodated of things needefull for their enterpri∣ses:
the which being variable and changeable accor∣ding
to the alteration of States and times haue no cer∣taine
rules. Only this, that such may safest trauell vnder
the shewes of those people which that State wherein
such must trauel to get intelligence hath the least ielou∣sie
of, and are in good friendshippe. Lastly, to keepe the
order and manner of their enterprise so secret, as that
those which send out such shall not know the plot of all
things if so be the same be deuised by the Intelligencers
themselues, which is euer least dangerous. Moreouer
it is required of such to enure themselues to endure the
accidentes of Sea or Land; as stormes, heate, colde, ex∣cesse
of meates and drinkes, sickenesse, much riotte of
speech, simplicitie and such like. And in a word whe∣ther
abroad, or at home, let such be carefull they be not
discouered for Intelligencers or had in ouermuch iea∣lousie,
but so warily demeane themselues that they may
aswell secure their own persons as benefite the State by
their intelligence.</P>
<P>There is an other kinde of Intelligencers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Base Intelli∣gencers.</NOTE> (but base
in respect of the former, by reason they assume a liber∣tie
to say what they list) who are inquisitors or diuers
into the behauiours and affections of men belonging to
a State, the carriages of whom are verie insupportable;
oftentimes exercising any libertie and licentiousnesse
to prie into the hearts of men to know how such stand
affected. But being also necessarie euils in a State, I
would counsaile such as vnhappily shall haue to deale
with this packe of <HI>Muches</HI> not so fauourablie to suffer
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
them to raile vpon the Nobilitie of this Land and dis∣couer
faults in the State, to blaspheme and dishonor the
Maiestie of God and of their Prince but rather to con∣iure
such so, as neuer afterwardes they shall delight in
that humorous-carnall-tempting and diuellish profe∣ssion.</P>
<P>The other sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men of warre.</NOTE> which likewise by the Princes or States
fauour are made Trauellers, are men of warre or souldi∣ers,
seruing on the Land or Sea; whether these be sent to
serue vnder other Princes or haue authority committed
vnto them to make warre themselues. Now conside∣ring
these are either Commanders or common Soul∣diers,
there ought to be a distinct consideration. As
touching the first, though wee might considerately e∣nough
leaue them out heere, being men of action and
experiēce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three generall offices of men of warre. To be proui∣dent and faith∣full.</NOTE> yet we obserue three general offices of these:
First, ere they vndertake their iournie, to be accōmoda∣ted
with euerie thing necessarie, both for men, munitiō,
victuals and monie, which being the sinewes of euerie
enterprise shall preuaile greatly. And in case that any be
sent to serue vnder other Princes, it is a thing most re∣quirable,
for the honour of their Prince and Country
and of themselues, to be much curious that euerie soul∣dier
be seemely apparelled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to exceed Commission.</NOTE> and orderly sorted with
men and armes, and other things necessarie, and to be
faithfull vnto their Soueraigne. Secondly, let euery one
take heede hee goe not beyond his Commission, but
rather in case of his absolute authoritie streighten his
owne power, neuer presuming vpon the fauour of the
Prince or State that sendeth such an one foorth. For
though the same sometimes may sort to a happie end,
yet the encroching on the prerogatiue royall is repro∣uable,
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
and without reward, though so aduantagious for
ones Prince, and Countrie. And as it is the cheefest
point of a Commaunder to obserue good discipline
to aduance euerie enterprise and designe▪ so especial∣ly
in case of seruing vnder forreine Princes and powers,
let such be blamelesse and irreproueable: accompli∣shing
moreouer with resolution and discretion whatso∣euer
is committed to the charge of such, nothing at∣tempting
vpon discretion without commaundement
of the Prince himselfe vnder whom such serue. And
that such be not lauish in rewarding with honour, or
too seuere in punishing offenders beyond the discipline
then exercised. The third and last consisteth in the
making true and diligent relation of euerie accident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To make true and diligent relation.</NOTE>
vnto the Prince to whome such belong. VVee shall
not neede to dilate on these, they are so common.
Nowe as concerning the common souldier in this
place of <HI>Non Voluntarie</HI> trauellers, let it only be exacted
of him, To be obedient to the discipline prescribed vn∣to
him, to esteeme of his armes as the cognisance of
a souldier; and neuer to be tainted with mutinie or
murmuring: For such do debarre themselues euermore
afterwarde of bearing armes, or of the reputation of
Souldiers, though such may pretend great cause. Of o∣ther
things let it be sought for in the voluntarie Tra∣uellers.</P>
<P>It nowe remaines wee touch vpon those that Inuo∣luntarily
are made Trauailers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inuoluntaries vpon displea∣sure!</NOTE> by the displeasure con∣ceaued
by the Prince, and by offence committed a∣gainst
the law. Those that haue trespassed against
the lawe, although in other States in times past
they were great personages, as others that lay open to
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
such punishments, yet here in England are men of no
accompt or reckening: such as being incorrigible per∣sons,
good for nothing, euill members, are for euer made
proscripts, and turned from the tuition of their naturall
friends and Countrie, to liue as runnagates in the wide
world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Banished per∣sons of two sorts.</NOTE> But as concerning such as stand banished by
displeasure and prerogatiue royal of the Prince, they are
of two sorts. The first of such are onely for breach of
Lawes in Court banished from the Court, and confined
to approche no neerer than so many miles, for a cer∣taine
space: these are not to our purpose. The other
is of such as the Prince vppon iust indignation bani∣sheth
the Land for a time certaine or not; wherby such
are forced to trauell, and are of the Gentrie or Nobili∣tie
alwayes, of whom the Prince hath a greater respect,
then of the Commons that sustaine all punishments in
their times according to the Lawes. Of whome these
Offices are exacted; First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their offices in trauaile.</NOTE> not to make shew of discon∣tentednesse
other then sorrow for the offence done. Se∣condly,
to depart the Land, within the time limited.
Thirdly, not to trauaile into their Princes enemies
Coūtries, or into the Coūtries of miscreants &amp; Infidels,
there to make their aboade; (for the one is a breach of
Religion, the other of allegeaunce and duetie to their
Prince, Soueraigne and Countrie: which yet remaine
to such so, during life) either for that they may obtaine
fauour to be recalled, or by decease of the Prince that
banished them in speciall cases of displeasure be freed
to returne from banishment: the benefite whereof they
may peraduenture lose if such shal be obserued to spend
their times in the enemies Countrie or keepe much fa∣miliaritie
with them. So is it to those that trauaile to
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
Pagans and Infidels, who although they may be friends
with their Prince, yet the office of banished trauellers
carrying the badge of Gods displeasure also vpon them
may not doe euerie thing that the policie of an Estate
shall permit: but in particular let them carrie themselues
so, as God their high Prince, who hath a more speciall
hand ouer such then ordinarie may be serued also and
appeased by obeysance to his word, which restraineth all
from voluntary fellowshippe with vnbeleeuers and vn∣godly
persons; much more to haue such a communitie
with them as being left to their choice they seeke rather
after such then the godly, &amp; as it were indenizen them∣selues
into their life, Religion and conuersation. Lastly,
that wheresoeuer these shall remaine, let them carrie
themselues so discreetly during their perigrination, that
they may procure themselues to regaine their Prin∣ces
fauour to restore them. And also when such shall so
fortunately be recalled, to behaue themselues like newe
creatures and subiects, abandoning all reprouable acti∣ons
that draw downe sodainely GODS displeasure,
&amp; consequently the like or greater iudgements. Thus
briefly may we conclude the first ranke of <HI>Regular</HI> and
lawfull Trauailers. The second followeth.</P>
<P>2 Which are also of the Crue of Inuoluntaries:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such as trauaile for Religion and conscience sake.</NOTE>
being moued to traueil for the maintenance only and
preseruation of their Religion, which vppon assured
grounds they know to be the true and only sauing pro∣fession
whereby they serue God aright according to
his word, and prepare themselues for a more diuine &amp;
excellent mansion then can be found or conceipted
heere on earth: the which thing may, of all other things
in the world held in estimation, prescribe against and
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
free them from the opposition of lawes humane, and
their allegeance; in such sort that whether men trauell
without commission or licence of the Prince and State
to whom they belong, or whether contrarie to the ex∣presse
cōmandemēt of the State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what cases their trauaile is warrantable.</NOTE> their callings are iusti∣fiable
&amp; honorable without the titles of fugitiues or re∣bels;
so such demeane themselues, in sort according to
godlines, &amp; as good subiects, before they put themselues
to trauel, &amp; during their perigrination. For if it be gene∣rally
held that faith is to be perswaded not compelled;
&amp; that no man hath power of Religiō, seeing that it pro∣ceedes
from the minde and will, the libertie whereof re∣steth
in the hands of God only, to dispose of: then of all
men those are most free that ground their Religion vpō
the word of God, which only is able to enfranchise and
giue an assured hope of standing, vnto the sincere pro∣fessors
thereof; making mens actions holy and warran∣table
euerie where. Hence, the subiects of a nation that
persecuteth the Gospell of Christ, &amp; establisheth lawes
derogatorie from the true worship of God cōmanded
onely in the holy scriptures, haue their <HI>Supersedeas</HI> au∣thenticall.
For which cause hath God, least his seruants
should make shipwracke of their faith and conscience,
whom he hath not fitted to be Martyrs, made a way in
the hearts of Princes that they may trauell into other
Nations peaceably, and there abide till the Lord shall
remooue the rodde of persecution from his Church.
Of which wee haue singular testimonies both in the
dayes of Queene <HI>Marie;</HI> and contrariewise in the bles∣sed
reigne of Queene <HI>ELIZABETH:</HI> Who
granted to seuerall Nations within her Dominions
freely to exercise their Religion, and that in distinct
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
formes, in their seuerall tongues, for the better enter∣tainement
of their consciences. Nowe to auoyde the
inconueniences of this libertie, that many vpon blinde
zeale and offended consciences may pretend; such Tra∣uailers
must obserue these Rules following, or the like.
First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their duties before trauell.</NOTE> that all subiects before they enterprise trauaile in
this kind are to consider with themselues, whether there
be not some other licentious affectes that spurre them
forward. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No licenti∣ous humor may presse these forth.</NOTE> though men vpon other grounds of af∣fectes
haue libertie to trauaile by licence or flight, yet is
their iournying altogether displeasing to God and dis∣parageable
with men: much more in the case of religiō.
For it is made changeable and turneth soone into hypo∣crisie.
Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Right Religiō▪</NOTE> such are to ponder well whether the
Religiō, which they professe and would gladly exercise,
be that which by Christ was instituted and by his Pro∣phets
and Apostles; contained in the Canonicall scrip∣tures:
wherein all ceremoniall and olde blind sacrificing
worshippe, all humane traditions that consent not with
the faith and to edification; all idolatrie and politi∣call
gouernement that derogateth from GODS
glorie, is forbiden, as thinges damnable. From
hence are all perigrinations and pilgrimages to a∣ny
place for the performance of vowes, or sacri∣ficings
for sinnes, impious and vaine. Thirdly,
howbeit, for the nourishment of that true and
righte Religion, men maye bee iustly mooued to
trauaile, yet it is the office of all so trauailing to
weighe and consider with themselues, first, whether
the same bee not professed alreadie in their Coun∣trie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Toleration of Religion.</NOTE>
or libertie permitted for such to exercise the same.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
For, if there be an exercise thereof there, or a toleratiō
though in a priuate sort, a subiect only for this ought
not to trauell nor forsake his owne Land, Countrie, pa∣rents,
brethren, and that Church whereof he is a mem∣ber,
for any other vaine perswasion or fancie▪ Fourthly,
if so be ther be neither publike exercise not priuate to∣leration;
and in case ther bee Lawes prohibitiue for
trauelling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To sue for licence of the Magistrate.</NOTE> it is the dutie of euerie subiect to mooue
the Prince or Magistrare, to whom authoritie is comit∣ted,
to grant licence: the which if it can not bee obtai∣ned
it is better to venture flight and shunne persecution
then to abide it; vnlesse such an one can find in his hart
the motions of strength and courage to suffer persecu∣tion
for the truth of the Gospell, without wauering. Yet
of the two it is better to flie from persecution, then be∣ing
come into it, to saint, &amp; so leaue their hope &amp; faith
in ieopardie. Lastly, let not such stand indifferent whe∣ther
they goe, so they may be prouided for: for if there
be any choice, the best is euermore to be elected. And
therfore considering in outward shew that is best where
the Gospell is flourishing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Coun∣tries are best for these to trauaile in. Of three, one free from dan∣ger.</NOTE> yet in other cases dāgerous;
I presuppose three kind of places to trauaile into for this
kinde of people, and only one free from danger. The
first, a State which is enemie to their Countrie. The
second, a State neerely linked in many respects to their
Countrie. The third, a State, which is indifferent: I
meane such a State as is neither fast friend, nor appa∣rant
enimie. To peece out our discouse about these
it is needelesse, being apparant vnto all men, that the
newter or free state is least dāgerous to be trauailed in∣to
for this kind of people. Their offices now in trauaile
offer themselues. First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their offices in trauaile.</NOTE> considering they are now be∣come
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
separates from the world, their courses must be so
much the more spirituall, that the prouident hand of
God may not be remooued from them, and that hee
may receaue them as members of his Church into fa∣uour
againe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To serue God sincerely.</NOTE> Wherefore let them serue God truely in
those places wherein they shall be dispersed; that they
may cause euerie nation fearing God to tender their
estates and to relieue their necessities. Secondly, let
them demeane themselues euerie one according to his
estate and abilitie answerable to the Lawes &amp; customes
of those places wherein they shall happily abide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To obey the lawes and dis∣cipline.</NOTE> that
no hatred or mislike befall on such. And in case the
number of those shall be so great as to make a congre∣gatiō
by themselues, hauing humbly obtained the same
of the Prince or Magistrate in a place conuenient, it be∣houeth
such a Congregation to institute that Order of
discipline which may best sort with the Magistrats plea∣sure:
that no iarres or dissension arise therein: or other
policie be established then that which consenteth with
other godly Churches, vnlesse it shall be left vnto their
owne election to sample their discipline after the most
reformed and esteemed Churches:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to change the discipline, being once Regular.</NOTE> about which if con∣trouersie
arise, let the appointment thereof be referred
to the Magistrate or Prince of the State. And in case the
same be thus once considerately established, wherein
no iust offence to any may arise (though in euerie poli∣ticke
bodie there are some weake members that are
scandaled at things indifferent) the same ought to bee
continued without alteration; least dissension and dis∣pleasure
creep in, a thing most displeasing in the church
of God; and to strangers, in a strange Nation most dan∣gerous.
But in case the numbers of such be so small, and
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
the place will not permit a distinct Church, then ought
such to be conformable vnto the discipline of that place,
auoyding also all publike and priuate mislike of the
discipline, or gouernement there vsed. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d though
that State retaine in their policie many things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In discipline the doctrine not the policy is to be sought after.</NOTE> which
were better left out, then commaunded, yet strangers
are to followe the doctrine and not externall things,
as Ceremonies and orders. For, the intermeddling
therewith sauoureth not of Christianitie and know∣ledge.</P>
<P>Thirdly, in case such be depriued of maintenance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to refuse any honest trad to liue by.</NOTE>
or if the custome of that place wherein they liue doe
accompt it requisite, let euerie one in his calling bend
himselfe to some honest Science or mechanicall trade,
that they may not only get their liuings honestly, but
may bee also reputed good members of that Com∣mon
Weale. Moreouer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No excesse to be discoue∣red.</NOTE> if wealth abound, let not
such spend that lauishly,wantonly, or carelesly.
For that benefiteth not any; much lesse strangers, in
a strange Nation, especiall the religious, the same be∣ing
a scandall to their profession.</P>
<P>So in matters and affaires of the ciuill State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Diuers in∣to the politicke gouernement or secrets.</NOTE> let them
not entermeddle nor be curious searchers into the se∣crets
therof. For, being placed in a State only for zeale
of Religion, they must giue continuall shew of vertue,
and shunne euerie thing that may breed iealousie; least
that State into which they are receiued hold them ra∣ther
for Spies, then for Religious professors. Neither
let such bee noted for fayneants and idle per∣sons:
for such corrupt an Estate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neuer to bee noted for idle persons.</NOTE> And let them bee
euer kinde and respectiue to the people with whome
they are suffered to liue amongst; rather sufferers of
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
iniuries then offerers of any wrong to them; neuer ac∣cepting
<HI>Duello,</HI> but by the permission of the Magi∣strate
for capitall wrong. Lastly, that thorough no
perswasion of their friends at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not treche∣rous to their owne Prince or Countrie.</NOTE> or of enemies a∣broad,
or of their owne tempting affections, they
goe about treacherously, or rebelliously, to practise or
rise against their natiue Soueraigne, in any sort, howe
vniust or vngodly soeuer their Prince be: but rather
seeke vnto God to turne his heart, and to giue a peace∣able
returne home vnto them.</P>
<P>The last point we will briefly handle concerning
their offices when they happily shal be recalled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their offices when they returne.</NOTE> or per∣mitted
to returne, in two obseruations. First, that how∣soeuer
the State stands affected, it being permitted to
them to haue libertie of conscience and priuate ex∣ercise
of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Noe busie bodies or moouers of sedition.</NOTE> Not to attempt or consent vnto
any commotion, insurrection, or any such treasonable
action, but to carry loyall hearts towards the Prince
and State, not once publikely speaking or writing a∣gainst
the Ecclesiastical policie, nor be strict and o∣uer-precise
in things externall and indifferent: but
carrie respect vnto the times, and late standing of
things; vsing all things to the glorie of God with∣out
offence or breach of conscience. And conside∣ring
that there is of most things a ciuill and super∣fluous
vse, let such retaine the Ciuill, and construe
euerie thing rather to the best and to edificati∣on,
then to preiudice the conscience of one another,
leauing the superstitious vseage to those that vppon
good knowledge doe vse thē. That other is the sociable
&amp; peaceable carriage of euerie one to his neighbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To vse a godly and quiet con∣uersation.</NOTE>
seeking al occasiōs to encrease loue and mutu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l societie.
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
As concerning other things required in Trauellers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Volūtaries▪</NOTE> let
it be sough for in the Voluntarie trauellers which now
offer themselues to be discoursed on, being the proper
subiect of our point in hand.</P>
<P>3 Before wee enter into the listes of this matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The moouers of Voluntaries. The pleasure of parents.</NOTE>
there are some things considerable: for there be some
that go vnder the name of voluntarie trauellers moued
out of their parents pleasure and will. The callings of
which may seeme equally lawfull no doubte, so their
parents performe their offices and haue them well gui∣ded
&amp; instructed, in the <HI>interim</HI> of their iourny (for tra∣uell
to some bodies are as new birthes; that beare them,
of dull mindes and sowre, good quicke and sweete con∣uersing
spirits and inclinations: yea amendeth many
imperfections of nature); so as the lawfulnesse of the
parents ende and purpose haue a lawfull pretence also.
Thus may the efficient and finall causes come foule one
of another:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The finall and efficient moo∣uing causes considered.</NOTE> for the clearing of which confusion, I iudge
it needefull to consider a few words of the endes in ge∣nerall;
that when the particular kindes of trauailers
shall be mentioned, their endes by implication may ap∣peare.
Of endes lawfull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two lawfull final moouers.</NOTE> there are two heades: one
Prime and principal; the other Congruent and Secon∣darie.</P>
<P>The prime is diuine and spirituall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prime.</NOTE> That afterwards
we may leade a more quiet, contented and peaceable
life, to the honor and glorie of God, with knowledge
and vnderstanding. And this no doubt ought to bee
the first marke, for euerie man to shoote at in this life,
that by doing the reuealed will of God, euerie one may
seek vnto himselfe the assurance of heauenly happinesse,
which is incomprehensible and eternall. That other,
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Congruent and Secondarie, is agreeable also and
fitting the calling of euerie particular;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The secondarie is duple.</NOTE> being of two
sorts: Publike or Priuate. The Publike is most ho∣norable,
and should stirre vp euerie man with delight to
vndertake trauaile for the good of ones Countrie.
Neither is the Priuate discommendable, considering
it giueth satisfaction or at the least sufficiencie to liue
well and happily according to the humor of the world,
whereby it may be apparant that the motiues and ends
of some are all one.</P>
<P>Moreouer, seeing it may be doubted whether all
persons may be included vnder the third ranke of Re∣gular
Trauellers: and also whether all times be fitting
for these to vndertake Trauaile: And lastly, whether
euery age be congruent with these: let vs in order cleare
these three points. To the first, I obserue three Oppo∣sers:
to wit Nature, which prohibiteth Infants and de∣crepit
persons, whose defect of vnderstanding and do∣ting
age pleadeth insufficiencie. Imperfection, others
as fooles, madde men and furious persons whose disa∣bilities
of minde are such as no hope can be expected
for the one or other. Lastly, the Sex in most Coun∣tries
prohibiteth women, who are rather for the house
then the fielde; and to remaine at home, then trauaile
into other Nations, but in speciall cases. As touching
the second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What times are fit to tra∣uaile in.</NOTE> what times are fittest for the voluntarie tra∣uellers
to goe in, we must obserue a duple season, ei∣ther
of their owne Countrie or of those whereinto
they would trauaile. Touching the first, let none tra∣uaile
at those times when their Countrey is engaged
with Ciuill, or expecteth warres. For, to leaue the
same in time of necessitie, were vnnaturall and dan∣gerous:
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
in the one case it being disparageable, to leaue
the Countrie when enemies inuade the same; in the o∣ther
case it may proue perilous to such, many sundrie
wayes. And therfore that time is best, whē ones Coun∣trie
is in peace and tranquilitie.</P>
<P>Touching the second, that the seasons also of such
Countries where into such trauaile ought to be regar∣ded,
it belongeth to euery particular to make ob∣seruance,
When he may reape most profit thereby
in the shortest time: namely the souldier when there are
warres: the Ciuilian or Lawyer, when great matters are
debated in Parliaments, Vniuersities or disputations,
concerning points of equitie, prerogatiue, iurisdiction
and such like: The Diuine, when any Generall or Na∣tionall
Councel is heald touching their profession: The
Mechanicke, when such and such Artes and trades doe
singularly florish &amp;c. Yet euerie man so trauailing must
take heede, how he goe into a Countrie that is iea∣lous
of his Prince, and subiects; which chaunceth e∣uermore
when Princes are enimies or when they haue
intestine warres and factions that vse any policie to ad∣uantage
their partie.</P>
<P>Now the third and last is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What age is meetest to tra∣uaile in.</NOTE> whether any age be con∣gruent
for these voluntaries. This is a harde thing to
resolue vpon; for there may be reasons on both sides,
that commend youth, and other reasons that preferre
the middle age. But seeing the reasons for youth profit
but in speciall cases and but few persons: I rather insist
vpon the middle age. For, the nonage of men is vnca∣pable
either to apprehend or comprehend things im∣portant,
for the State of which they are, or for thēselues:
Or else transported with many turbulent affections that
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
hinder their quiet ingenious vnderstādings, and rather
gather corruption thē commendablenesse, which ouer∣waigh
such good parts as they happily in longe time
with paines haue collected. Wherefore the Divine
<HI>Plato</HI> by implication forbade men to trauell in this kind
till they came to fortie yeares of age. But our age and
climate now perfecteth sooner: and therefore wee will
take the meaning of his wordes, which implyeth thus
much; That age to be fittest for trauaile in which a man
in shortest time may make most profitte, and bee in
least daunger to be corrupted, by his owne swaying
affections, or by the stie perswasions of others: The
which chāceth in our Climate after twentie fiue yeres
in most bodies; and therefore the Phylosopher addeth,
Such might trauell till 50 yeares. By which words I col∣lect
two things: one, that men shold not make too short
a returne, and so be little bettred by their trauaile. The
other that when men grow aged and declining, trauai∣ling
shold be left off (considering that age is laboursom
enough without trauaile, and it argueth incōsideratnes)
but in speciall cases. So as the middle age frō thirtie or
therabouts vnto fortie is the most gathering, for such as
will be publike members of a Common-weale, to learne
obserue and collect so many things as are requireable
in all worthy and compleat Trauailers. Nowe to our
point in hand: the persons thus voluntarily prest out are
either of the Nobilitie or of the Commons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">These volun∣taries are Nobles or Commons. The nobles either make profession or not.</NOTE> The Nobi∣litie
are either general or speciall. The Nobilitie general
are such as haue no profession singular: The speciall are
such as before trauel make some professiō wherof I cō∣ceaue
fower distinct kinds: Diuines, Souldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure notable professions.</NOTE> Ciuill
Lawers, Physitiās; of which we will cōsider after we haue
grated vpō the Cōmons: who are either Mechanicks or Marchants.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="18"/>
The Marchants are of two sorts here meant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two rankes of Marchants.</NOTE> such as are
knowen to the State, and such as goe vnder the name of
warre, vnknown to the State otherwise then by letters
of marke and permission: who are chiefly to take heed
they transgresse not the boundes of their Commission.
And therefore before they trauaile by Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men of warre &amp; their offices.</NOTE> let them
learne well, who may be made prises▪ and what; east the
State be troubled for the abuse of such, and they them∣selues
shent and lose their voiage. Moreouer, let them
be carefull to set downe in their seuerall Sea Charts, e∣uerie
thing of speciall note; as Countries, Hauens,
Creekes, Iles, Rockes, Gulfes, Shooles, Sands, Shelues
and such like: whereby others after them may make vse
thereof, to the profit of the Common-weale. And
when these shall returne, to make a true relation (if they
be demaunded) of euerie accident during their voyage,
and of such aduertisements as may stand the Sate in
vse, of which they are.</P>
<P>But those other knowen Marchants, for that their
Trauailes are knowen to be profitable, and of honest
esteeme, they haue speciall priuiledges which to no o∣ther
voluntarie Trauailer chanceth; namely to passe
and repasse with safe conduct, themselues and their
substances, vnlesse in times of warre, &amp;c. In regarde
whereof they are tyed vnto these duties; First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The duties of marchants.</NOTE> First, by a
prudent, deligent, and faithfull care to obserue by what
things the State may be most benefited; and to haue
perseuerance where such Marchandize that the State
most vseth and desireth may be had with greatest ease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To accommo∣date their coun¦try with good and most need∣full thinges.</NOTE>
least charge, and without inconuenience to his Coun∣trey:
Where there may be a likelihoode of continu∣ance
without mislike of their Princes, whose affaires
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
are much managed by Marchants. And though the
disposition of these things belongs to the Prince, yet
the disquisition appertaineth to the calling of Mar∣chants;
who, when they haue excogitated a thing to
the benefit of the State by Marchandize or new trades,
referre the discussion to the Counsaile of the Prince
whether the same be aduantagious or no. Secondly,
let them in any case not transport any thing pro∣hibited;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neuer to trans∣port thinges prohibited.</NOTE>
or vnto their Countries enemies, nor suffer
their Factors to send ouer such as may be displeasing or
vnprofitable to their Prince, Lawes, or Countrie.
Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To conceale the secrets of their Princes states.</NOTE> let all of this kinde conceale the secrets and
outward state of their Countrie with faithfulnesse and
respect: and be verie circumspect to prie into the se∣crets
of other Countries where they come, least they
be held for spies and no Marchants; a thing most dan∣gerous
to those people.</P>
<P>Lastly, forasmuch as most of this kinde of Trauai∣lers
are of singular iudgement and vnderstanding, to
make prudent obseruation of things beneficiall to the
State: Let thē if so they be demanded relate how things
stand abroad, and in case they know any thing of mo∣ment
the concealement whereof may incommodate
the State, it is their duetie to discouer the same when
they retourne, with the greatest secrecie and speed vnto
such as are knowne to bee priuie Councellers, and to
none other. For, oftentimes passing thorough many
mouthes, the importances of good newes and intelli∣gence
are much impaired.</P>
<P>The other sort of the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mechanicke trauailers.</NOTE> to witte, Mecha∣nickes
(whose trauaile may also accommodate an
Estate with many things to set the poorer sort to worke
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
and as it were plant in their Countrie the cōmodities &amp;
peculiar trades of other nations) now resteth to behād∣led.
The chiefe trades wherof are by Marchāts brought
for the most part into States, and by them ordered till
long vse disperse thē throughout, to the benefit generall.
Now, in regard with vs there are many Artes, not in that
perfection as in other Coūtries, or such as the rarer sort
of those be, which are set vp and vpheld by strangers to
the preiudice of the Realme (yet not so much as in case
there were none at all) it is a thing verie requisite for
these kind of Trauellers and for the State, in case they
cannot be attained vnto at home. Moreouer we see in o∣ther
Countries few, apprentises, aboue three yeares for
one trade; which giueth much encouragement to such
as couet the same. And there is nothing more benefici∣all
for a State to vphold the same then the vsing of these
Occupations and trades which set many hands to worke
and haue many dependants. Wherefore in times past
there were reckoned but vii. Mechanicke Artes, because
a State could not want either, and in regard they are the
generall heads vpon which all other depend. Hence in
our State husbandrie and Clothing are the nerues of the
weale publike, the failing whereof must needs turne the
cote of the State. Insomuch as it is a hard matter to dis∣cerne
whether Woll or Corne accōmodate this State
more: though expresly Tillage carrie the greater sway
then breeding of Sheepe and grasing. But to our pur∣pose.</P>
<P>Let such trauailers first, hauing libertie to trauaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The offices of Mechanickes in iourneying.</NOTE> sur∣uey
the best places, where those Arts are to be learned;
as in <HI>Germanie</HI> all manner of Formers, Potters or figu∣lists
are to be found in perfection. In <HI>Italy</HI> Architecture,
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
Limming, Painting, Engrauing, Imagerie, <HI>Textorie,</HI> and
weauing, and Artes ingenious may be learned. So ac∣cording
to euerie Countries seuerall commodities se∣uerall
and peculiar Artes do flourish. Lastly, let them
spend their times so diligently as commoditie and esti∣mation
be their reward.</P>
<P>The Nobilitie as was said were generall or speciall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The considera∣tion of the foure notable professions in noble trauelers</NOTE>
The special were of fower sorts, Diuines, Souldiers, Ciuil
Lawyers, &amp; Physiciās: which are so called special Trauai∣lers
not in regard such be more excellent or honorable
thē others, but for that such prescribe vnto thē a speciall
thing to be attaind vnto as wel for perfectiō as satisfactiō.
Of these in order. First, the Diuines be such as make pro∣fession
of Diuinitie outwardly in the State, wherby they
may be imployed in the Ministrie and seruice of God.
And although all men must account it a chiefe honour
vnto them contemplatiuely to make profession thereof:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuines, inhi∣bited trauaile but in speciall cases.</NOTE>
yet such may not trauaile but in speciall cases as before
hath been alleadged, on the pretence of knowledge; the
same being to be attained vnto within their own Coun∣trie:
wheras the outward professors, that haue the calling
of Ministers, haue in some cases better warrant.</P>
<P>Howbeit, by our pofitiue law Clearkes are forbid to
trauaile, for this pretence. For in case such may be satis∣fied
and endoctrined in the points they doubt of within
their owne Princes Dominions, of godly and learned
professors, I see not how their Trauailes can be lawfull.
But in case where the Gospel and truth is not preached,
I iudge it a most happy thing for any whosoeuer to serch
the word in other nations:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The person of a subiect belongs cheifely to the Princes disposi∣tion.</NOTE> but not without licence of the
State. For no man ought to dispose of himselfe so, as his
Prince should lose the benefit of his person, the which is
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
dispensable in the case of God onely and in case of per∣secution,
wherein God is interessed. Moreouer, it is
from the office of Ministers that haue the cure of soules,
to goe into voluntarie Trauaile, for any ordinarie pre∣tense,
and leaue the same without a right good
shepheard; and in many cases not then, though he leaue
in his roome a carefull pastor. For, this function and
vocation is more to be respected then others, it being
singularly dedicated to the seruice of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure lawfull pretenses of Diuines to tra∣uaile.</NOTE> Then of
such Diuines as may trauaile we obserue foure preten∣ses:
two generall, and two speciall. The generall are
either of a generall Councell or Nationall:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The generall Counsaile.</NOTE> or of some
famous Librarie. But in case such Councels bee not
compounded of worthie and knowen men, of learning
and iudgement &amp; approued by the State whereof men
are, the profit will be so little as the pretence must cease.
So is it of the other generall pretence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A famous Librarie.</NOTE> namely the view
of some famous Librarie, which containeth such fa∣mous
printed bookes or manuscripts as faithfully dis∣cusse
of points not yet concluded, nor to bee had and
procured other where. For, in case by transscripts or
any assured collections men may attaine vnto the pith
of those points, this pretense should also cease. The
two pretences are either to haue conference with such
famous men, whose learning may satisfie &amp; endoctrine;
or else with those naturall Iewes and Grecians whose
learning may for the furtherāce of those diuine tongues
giue much helpe to the vnderstanding of the Scriptures.
Yet if so the Gospell flourish already, in their owne
Countrie, and that there be learned men to bee reue∣renced,
in all things to be doubted of; if such choose
rather to trauaile then to conferre, and aske to be resol∣ued
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
of those their Countriemen, the pretence of them
must also cease. For, it is a contempt to the Church
whereof they are members, to trauaile for instruction,
when men may be well instructed at home without in∣conuenience,
especially where there are Vniuersities, &amp;
publike professors of thē. It is needlesse to prescribe rules
for these in trauailing: for the most are sage and prudent
men; and therefore we will passe to the second sort: to
weet Ciuilians.</P>
<P>Ciuile Lawyers haue a lawfull pretence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciuilians.</NOTE> so be it the
Ciuile Law be in request in the State whereof such are,
and cannot be attained in so singular a manner, as in
those Vniuersities that wholly consist therof, and where
that law flowrisheth most. And although the Law may
in some sort, by reading and conference in the Vniuer∣sities,
be for Theorie and iudgement sufficiently gotten
in ones owne Countrie, yet the liuely expression and
Elocution thereof I iudge in other Nations for the
common vse may adorne counsaile in the best manner.
Wherefore as it is the office of Diuines aboue all things
to take heed in their trauaile they be not corrupted with
false doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The offices of Diuines and Ciuilians.</NOTE> wherwith other people of other Nations
striue to tempt Schollers at this day: so let it be the first
office of these Ciuilians (men for the most part indued
with great vnderstanding &amp; faculties) to be well groun∣ded
in their Religion before, and consequently faithfull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To be settled and stable in Religion.</NOTE>
secret &amp; honest to their Coūtrie, hauing a vigdant eye,
that they be not misseled by the subtilties of other Nati∣ons,
&amp; many of their vnsound positiōs in their law Ca∣non,
frō the sinceritie of their Religiō &amp; the Gospell: the
which shall adorne them when they returne, more then
all their learning and obseruations. For, by how much
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
men of wit and vnderstanding stand firme in the truth, &amp;
puritie of Religion, by so much shal their learnings and
honesties be had in recommendation, with whom they
conuerse afterwards; the same in Trauailers volunta∣rie
being a rare matter. Moreouer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To be studious</NOTE> let them be careful to
make obseruance for the rights, customes, statutes, ordi∣nances,
proclamations, decrees, particular lawes and pri∣uiledges,
liberties &amp; prerogatiues of places and persons
where happily they shal come. Lastly, whensoeuer they
trauaile into forreine States where there are Vniuersities
and where there are degrees to be taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To take degrees,</NOTE> let them labour
to attaine to the same. For, to men of desert it is reputed
a dishonor, to returne without them, in case they freely
may be attained vnto. For, otherwise the pretence of their
trauaile wil in the mindes of men cease, the degree being
the Crowne of their vocatiō, which to professors is most
necessarie. For other things we referre them to such ob∣seruations
as to the generall Voluntaries are prescribed,
afterwards. The Souldiers follow.</P>
<P>The profession of these voluntarie Trauailers is armes
and warrefare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Souldiers.</NOTE> athing much approued of euerie Com∣mon
weale. And although none should so binde himself
to that vocation, as all his life time to liue by the same,
but rather in peace and tranquillitie afterwardes, yet the
pretence of young men &amp; of able bodies, to endure hard∣nesse
for the aduancement of their Countries weale and
discipline, is honorable, carying a more sensible le liking of
the State thē the former two. And although, by reading,
conference and such like consideratiōs vpon other mens
experiences, many are made good Theoristes &amp; Coun∣sellers
in warre to direct orderly &amp; warily before battel
or skirmish, yet no man can be a compleat soldier with∣out
<PB N="27" REF="21"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>tion, &amp; almost continuall exercise in armes. For
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> encounters chance, self-eye-seeing experience shal
be a readier preuentresse of accidēts &amp; infinite occurren∣ces
that chance, to assure the victorie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sorts of good Soldiers.</NOTE> Yet are there thus
two compleate kinds of Soldiers in their seuerall kindes;
Such as be experienced themselues &amp; men of action: and
those whose singular contemplation on the experiences
of others, are able in meete time to giue good direction
and counsaile. For, as there are some whose experience
only haue made them learned to encounter actions and
accidēts, &amp; in the incountring are right circumspect and
valorous, yet can not such in Counsaile giue the best di∣rection,
for the generall encountering of inconuenien∣ces:
so there are others on the contrarie, whose prudent
care to prouide for euerie occurrence; that to the vnder∣standing
at first and before action is represented, is such
as if euerie thing should fall out according to their deli∣beration,
no doubt would assure victorie:but, comming
to ioyne, faile on the sodaine what to resolue of. But
when the spectacles of the one are ioyned with the eyes
of the other, in that souldier doubtlesse compleatnesse
and perfection dwelleth. For,as glasses artificiall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Compleat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Souldier.</NOTE> con∣cording
with the nature of each sight, aide and pre∣serue
much the sight of euerie eye; so Arte ioyned
with experience, in warre especially, giueth an assurance
of perfection, aswell to preuent the worst, as to pro∣uide
for the best, and that vppon an instant; which
beareth great swaie in battailes. Wherefore, in the
first place as for those that are minded to bee Tra∣uailers
in this kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first point of learning in a Souldier.</NOTE> they had need to learn the grounds
of the Arte of warre before hand, that such may make
the best vse of their times; namely, Arithmeticke,
<PB N="28" REF="22"/>
Geometrie and other Mathematicke sciences, that may
happily traine them vp to more iudgement in one yeare
(if so they also passe some time in historie) then others in
fiue. Secondly, being thus prepared, let them consider
with themselues that no one discontentment wage them
forwarde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second point of consi∣deration.</NOTE> but to enable thēselues for to do their Coun∣trie
good, and Prince seruice, when occasion shall bee
profered. For, such as go otherwise cannot be assured
of Gods protection, blessing or fauour: for want wher∣of
we see how vainly the greater part of these Trauellers
spend their times. Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third,</NOTE> they are to ponder whether
at such time as they would trauaile, their Prince and
Countrie shall not neede to imploy their seruice either
at home or abroad: For, in such cases it cannot but ar∣gue
vanitie to trauaile, when as their Prince or Countrie
shall haue speciall vse of them. Fourthly, to accustome
themselues to endure extreamities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth.</NOTE> of heate and cold, of
paines of body and minde, of bodily trauaile in swift
and slowe motions, and to be able to manage euery sort
of armes offensiue or defensiue vsed on horsebacke or on
foote:that, when such shal come to serue in the warres of
any Prince, estimation attend on them. For, none can be
iustly reputed for his particular a cōpleat soldier in acti∣on,
but he that is able to serue in all attempts in any kind
of seruice with iudgement and resolution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fift.</NOTE> Fiftly, let such
bend their trauels into those Coūtries, either wher their
Prince maketh war or fauoreth; or go vnder the conduct
of such Princes, as are neerest friends vnto their Prince &amp;
Countrie. For, it is vnseemely that any should choose to
serue rather vnder strangers then friends. Lastly, to this
must be annexed, that such trauaile for their greater be∣nefit
into those Countries where best seruice and disci∣pline
<PB N="29" REF="22"/>
is to be learned:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What maketh a good soldier.</NOTE> for that maketh a Soldier to be
vnder good discipline &amp; to see good seruice; which is in
duple respect, either of the enemie against whom, or in
the Countrie wherein such serue. The enemie against
whō men serue, doth aduāce the seruice if he be stirring,
&amp; alwayes plotting of some matter against his enemies,
whether hee keepe the fielde or lie in Garrison: In li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
sort may the seruice be bettered by those vnder whom
men serue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A triple kind of seruice, to per∣fect souldiers.</NOTE> The consideration of the Countrie is tri∣ple,
that maketh the seruice good, which in the ende
shall perfect a Souldier: the first is, where the Countrie
is champaine, &amp; that either of Moūtains or of Valleyes:
the seruice wherein makes men alwayes to stand vp∣on
their guard, and to be well accompanied in euerie
designe. The second in couert Countries, marishie
and boggie; which are the aptest for stratagemes and
surprizes, making men watchfull &amp; prouident euermore
to suspect the worst, wheresoeuer they come. The third
and last, are the fortifications of Countries, or those
Countries that stand most vpon them, which employ
the spirits and ingenious parts of Souldiers, after an ex∣traordinarie
manner.</P>
<P>The first <HI>Nauarre</HI> and <HI>Sauoy</HI> are apt for, and the Lowe
Countries that bee wasted: The seconde, <HI>Ireland</HI>
will furnish men with: And, in the worlde for the
third, a man cannot haue better experience then in
the Lowe Countries. So as when such Trauailers haue
gotten experience in one, if they desire perfection, let
them trauaile for the other: For in few Countries &amp; wars
shall men finde all.</P>
<P>Then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their duties in seruice.</NOTE> being arriued into the Armie or Garrison and
entred into the seruice, first, with great diligence euerie <MILESTONE N="1"/>
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>
thing of speciall make contained either in discipline of
seruice ought to be obserued: and for euerie mans better
vnderstanding, let them discourse thereof and question.
<MILESTONE N="2"/> Secondly, let such be verie studious to be obserue all lawes
and ordinances of that discipline; as also to obey euerie
speciall Commandement of their Cōmanders: for them
consisteth the honor of a soldier. And though the disci∣plin
permit much libertie of idlenes, (wherby many are
entised to gaming, vnholy &amp; vnprofitable exercises). Let
such, being strangers especially, abstain frō those childish
recreations, and either confer about things they are igno∣rant
of, or reade such books of warre &amp; historie, that may
sharpen and giue knowledge continually to them; or
with company follow the managing of Armes offensiue
or defensiue, wherin men cannot be too skilful: or the ex∣ercise
of vaulting, leaping, swimming, darting, shooting,
&amp; such other of the arme as gather strength &amp; nimblenes
<MILESTONE N="3"/> to the body, which in wars are of no small proofe. Third∣ly,
aboue all things let strangers feare to motimie, or ac∣cept
of quarrels, but rather put vp iniuries then offer any.
For there is a ciuill and honorable redresse of wrongs, in
war, to be expected from the General, Mareschall, &amp; Cō∣manders
of the Armie, whose sentence ought to be expe∣cted
in all things of the same nature, yea in accepting of
Combates for the honor of ones Prince and Countrie a∣gainst
the enemies, if occasion be offered.</P>
<P>Moreouer, let such take heede, they neuer offer to ac∣cept
of Combate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> for the honour of another Nation, if
any of the same serue in the same place: for that is an in∣iurie
<MILESTONE N="4"/> to that Nation. Fourthly, as none may serue vnder
infidels, in case there be wars in Christendom: and as none
may go and serue vnder such as are doubtfull friends vnto
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
their Countrie or Enimies; so are all to be carefull to
serue, where the right is most apparant, and where the
Gospell is preached in the armie, that God may giue thē
best successe So in case there be no wars in Christēdom,
let such trauaile to other nations (after licence obtained
of their Prince) and seeke seruice of such Princes that
neither warre against Christians, nor haue an ill quarrell
in hand. For, as it is a shame for any to take part with e∣nemies
or with infidels against ones own Coūtrie: so it is
requisite on the other side that they serue in those wars
amongst infidels, whose cause and quarrel is iust &amp; good
in the sight of men. Lastly, let all those who will make <MILESTONE N="5"/>
their pretence good in the opinion of men, carry them∣selues
so strictly in these and other common duties per∣taining
to souldiers, as that they make not profession
thereof, but to establish peace and tranquillitie, when
happily they shal returne home to their Countrie, as
good Bees with wax and honey, to their hiue of the
Common-weale, and demeane themselues so in times
of peace, as they giue ensample to gowned men, of
peaceable and orderly liuing; neither in riot nor in ambi∣tion,
or pride, which keepe reuell roupt in the dereigled
crue of Trauailers. Now, as concerning the last or∣der
of Voluntarie speciall Trauailers: namely of Physi∣cians.</P>
<P>By the word Physician, is meant first such as haue the
lawfull calling;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Physicians.</NOTE> and either haue alreadie or intende to

For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two knowled∣ges requireable in Physicians.</NOTE> the remedying of all which, there are two things
requirable; namely, the simple knowledge of euerie li∣uing
and inanimate thing, whether of Mineralls, Vege∣tables,
sensible Animalles, or of man and the experi∣ence
how each of these in seuerall Countries and bodies
haue their certaine operations. And seeing without
doubt God hath planted, in the world, meanes (either of
simples or of Compounds) to remedie any sickenesse or
cure any wound, although the knowledge or meanes be
not alwaies blessed; wee may collect the lawfulnesse of
Physiciās trauaile also. And though God haue fitted eue∣rie
Climate and Countrie with meanes to relieue the
common distresses and grieueances of men, yet wee see
for want of knowledge in Physicians either how to vse
the simples in their owne Countries or how to com∣pound
them aright according to the <HI>Dose</HI> of euery body
natural, they are enforced to search into other Countries
for aide.</P>
<P>For, though we haue, as other Countries, many sin∣gular
things to remedie the decay or disquiets of nature:
yet seeing the simples of other Countries, for some par∣ticular
bodies and griefes, are more naturall then many
compounds of our own, &amp; the skil is lesse to apply them,
why shold not necessitie make Physicians trauel for know¦ledge
as the old wife for neede. We see the artificiall Be∣zar
stone to be lesse profitable for some bodies then the
natural; the fained <HI>Sanguis Draconis</HI> thē the right which
is brought frō <HI>Africa:</HI> &amp; so of such like adulterous resem∣blāces,
which necessitie, &amp; mens gains haue laboured &amp;
arted. In the Vniuersities of learned men, that science,
and store of bookes of all things in the world for sim∣ples
and compoundes according to their natures,
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
and vertues are better described then any one by his own
trauaile can amend: (For in Trauaile there must ne∣cessarily
bee much time spent, and little practise had at
home: and practise is no doubt the best thing that ma∣keth
a good Physician) neuerthelesse for some diseases
a man shall happily learne more by trauaile, then by all
these at home.</P>
<P>For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The studie of Physicians.</NOTE> there are many of our capitall diseases easily cu∣red
in other Countries. Now then, hee that will make
good of his pretence, must labour into the grounds of
Astronomie and Astrologie, as of proportiō. For, with∣out
these, such wander without a guide in the wildernes
of nature. Moreouer, during their trauaile (after licence
obtained) let them make vse of euerie thing they shall
see; aswell of things knowne as of the vnknowne. For
the difference of Climates and soyles, alter much the na∣ture
of euerie thing.</P>
<P>In like sort must such obserue the persons in euerie
Countrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Common and accidentall diseases,</NOTE> so particularly as they can, and marke their
common and accidentall diseases, &amp; to take knowledge
of their cures. So if there be any speciall Bathes, Wa∣ters,
Pooles, Spawes, or Springs, the operation
whereof may cure any maladie, to learne their ver∣tues.</P>
<P>And lastly to frequent the most famous places and
companies of learned men, whereby such may better
their knowledge, &amp; increase their discourse: which is no
small thing, in a Physician, to be well mannered, ciuill,
wittie, and pleasant, and of able disposition to delight his
patiēts by discourse. Moreouer, if such light vpō simples,
which are either of a strāge nature or that excell ours, let
them bee carefull to transplant them; hauing a care
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>
to the soile, climate, and growing of such, that Arte
here may repaire the naturall defect of the Countrey.
But considering many, when they returne home, are
tainted with the humor of most trauailers, namely selfe
conceipt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vertue of Physicians.</NOTE> and better thinking of themselues then is con∣uenient,
let them be as respectiue to relieue the poore &amp;
the needie as the rich. For many Physicians will not go
out of the doores to saue a poore mans life. Moreouer,
let them be carefull to administer noe desperate or vn∣knowen
thing vnto any: for such, as in the former case,
are no lesse then murtherers before God, if their pati∣ents
proue not well vnder them. Neither let couetous∣nes
ouer-rule them, as those Physicians and Surge∣ons
that dallie with mens bodies to get much monie:
but let euerie one accoumpt it his duetie to do good to
any. And in so doing they shall finde God their Physi∣cian
not only of their bodyes but of their soules: wher∣as
otherwise the saying of our Nation may be applyed
fitly vnto them, Physicians cure your selues. Thus farre
of the speciall Voluntarie Trauailers.</P>

are of the temporall Nobilitie
of the Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These Volun∣taries are to vndergoe sixe po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts before trauaile. The first point.</NOTE> whether superior or
inferior: and before they vnder∣take
Trauaile, if they will be bette∣red
thereby, are to vndergoe sixe
dueties. The first is to counsaile and
deliberate with themselues, whether they bee mooued
with the iust pretence of doing good to the Common
weale, whereof they are, and for the enabling of them∣selues,
with such knowledges as appertaine to their se∣uerall
callings; or whether their owne lusts and affecti∣ons
pricke them not forward. For oft men are deceiued
for want of due consideration thereof, which turneth
the plots of men topsieturuie. And though it be hard to
res<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lue on this with humane strength and reason, (for
that reason, which by nature is in man, is feeble and dif∣fereth
<PB N="36" REF="29"/>
little from that of brute beasts) yet there is another
reason in man, or the same at the least enlightned and
sanctified by God, the which through faith and know∣ledge
of his reuealed wil, teacheth man to do that which
is good and pleasing in his sight. Wherefore, as this rea∣son
is pure &amp; of an holy vnderstāding nature, so must the
resolutiōs of men (if they would be approued and crow∣ned
with blessing) be shaped accordingly. And there∣fore
all particular affects, rising from the disordinate ap∣petite
of man corrupt and vnsauorie (as Ambition, Sen∣sualitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue principall euil mouers of men to tra∣uaile to be shunned.</NOTE>
vaine glorie, couetousnes, vanitie of knowledge,
&amp; such like) must die in these honorable kind of Trauai∣lers;
and in lieu of them the rootes of all vertuous affe∣ctions
must be planted, to the glorie of God, the good
of themselues, their Prince &amp; Countrie. For, consi∣dering
these are principally the select members ordeined
to trauaile, by the appointing hand of God, to helpe
the motion and gouernement of the helme in tempo∣rall
&amp; ciuill causes oftentimes, let such take heede those
vaine and gadding humors plucke not downe the iudge∣ment
of God, to presse such to trauaile for punishment
of their wayes; whereby none can seale vnto themselues
the assurance of life, or prosperitie, during their trauaile
or afterwards.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second point,</NOTE> in the second place it is required that such ex∣amine
themselues before trauaile, whether they haue
capable parts answerable to the callings of these Trauai∣lers.
The capable parts of Trauailers consist in know∣ledge
and iudgement of those things that may best pro∣fit
them in trauaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knowledge &amp; Iudgement the enhablers of trauailers.</NOTE> and furnish them of things needeful,
by which men are fitted to accomplish so honorable an
enterprise.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="29"/>
By Iudgement is meant the vnderstanding age, seeing
into the affaires of their natiue Countrie: Knowledge, it
is of the wants which are naturally in vs; the which are
to be supplyed and repaired, by learning and experi∣ence.</P>
<P>For, as without iudgement men cannot gather the
best things in trauaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Without lear∣ning or experi∣ence, no know∣ledge.</NOTE> that may fitte iumpest with the
State of their Countrie and themselues: so without
knowledge things cannot bee performed well.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudgement the collector of profitable things.</NOTE> And
therefore it behoueth euerie one, so intending to tra∣uaile,
to be endued with learning and discretion: for by
learning knowledge is atchieued, and discretiō enableth
the iudgement to discerne what things and Policies are
to be receiued what reiected. And vnlesse men put on
before trauaile these Armours, they cannot winne the
forte of their desires. For, he that trauaileth to see expe∣riences
in other Nations, and hath not power to dis∣cerne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The defect of learning or iudgement what it bree∣deth.</NOTE>
what are needefull to bee gathered, commeth
home as a bodie to the graue without a soule. In which
plight we see daily experience in this Land: for many
trauaile young that want both: others of more vnderstan∣ding
that want iudgement and others whose iudgemēts
are actiue, yet faile in learning. So as many when they
come home proue too subtill, &amp; without conscience, in
their resolutions, and consequently dangerous to be con∣uersed
with; others new fangled hobby horses, &amp; of smal
vnderstanding, or little the better to be conuersed with.</P>
<P>From hence the third dutie springeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third point</NOTE> namely Instru∣ction
in knowledge fit for trauailers: the which is either
of things appertaining to the Country where such trauel,
or to thēselues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things appertaine to themselues.</NOTE> First, as concerning things belonging to
thēselues, they are three; qualities, vertues and sciences.
<PB N="38" REF="30"/>
The qualities are duple; either for necessitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qualities duple. The necessary.</NOTE> or for Or∣nation.
The necessarie is the speaking or the vnderstan∣ding
of the tongues of those Countries into which such
trauaile: for these are the instruments of knowledge and
experience; without which men shall consume great
time vnprofitably in other Countries, whiles they are
learning the tongue. And therefore let such practise the
tongues before they trauaile, that they make not a sha∣dowe
of their knowledge as many doe: who trauailing
into other Countries attaine to nothing, saue the spea∣king
of their languages.<NOTE PLACE="marg">For Ornation.</NOTE> The qualities for Ornation, are
practise in managing of Armes and weapons, skill in
Musicke and daunsing and drawing the counterfeites of
any thing: The estimation of all which are so approued
that they neede no confirmation; For euerie man liuing
in the Courts of Princes shall bee honoured by them.
The second point of knowledge are vertues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their vertues.</NOTE> which
must be the Councellors of such in euerie Action,
to make them esteemed, and make them right Cour∣tiers
at the first entrance, in euerie forreine State. And
therefore let them inhabite euerie diuine and morall
vertue, that traineth men vp to humanitie &amp; ciuile con∣uersation:
without which it is a vaine thing to trauaile
and expect any good ende.</P>
<P>The last and third point of knowledge is Science or
the knowledge in naturall and mathematicall Artes: that
is to say, an insight in the grounds of Astronomie, Astro∣logy,
Cosmographie, Geographie, Hydrographie, Geo∣metrie,
Arithmeticke and Architecture: all which who∣soeuer
trauaileth shall employ, and without which ma∣ny
things of note shall be foreslowen, and left vnper∣fectly
knowen. For, the better men are grounded in
<PB N="39" REF="30"/>
these, the more profite shall they make of their times. In
so much as if a skilfull fortifier or Architectist doe but
lay his eyes vpon the modell of any Towne or fortifica∣tion,
he will deliuer the true plot, strength or weakenes
naturall or artificiall that it containes, or ghesse verie
neere; the which an ignorant person can neuer doo, but
by chaunce. So it is of those which excell in Corogra∣phy
or Geographie; who but riding poste through a
Countrie will make a particular description of euerie
thing seated on the earth, in proportion or neere, aswell
of Townes, Fortes, Houses, as of Riuers, Hilles, Dales,
Woddes, Plaines and Wayes, or any thing else that
lies within the kenning of their eies, or by necessarie col∣lection.
And therefore we finde recorded that in times
of war messengers of the enemie were wont to be blin∣ded,
when they approched neere the fortifications or
Campes, and so carried backe till they were out of
kenning. The which may be saide of the rest: For these
Artes are instruments to settle and fixe in the memorie
obiects that fall to the senses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rules of Art are as faith full helpers of mens memo¦ries.</NOTE> but especially to the eye:
euen as wee see the practicke Musicians will instantly
play whatsoeuer chaunceth in harmonies sound to their
eare. I consideratly left out Musicke among the Mathe∣maticall
Artes, though it be an excellent Science: yet in
a Trauailer or Gentleman let it be rather a qualitie, as we
haue saide to grace him in conuenient times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musicke rather a qualitie then a Science in trauailers of this kinde.</NOTE> and places
to be sociable, then a Science whereof men make pro∣fession.
For, a Gentleman may haue the qualitie to
play well vpon gentlemanlike instruments, without the
Science or Arte of any grounds of musicke; euen as
there may be excellent Musicians that can not strike one
true stroke of any instrument, and yet both concluded
<PB N="40" REF="31"/>
vnder one name. For the theorie &amp; practicke in Musicke
are two; &amp; the one seemely for gentlemē of other means,
namely the practicke: although it cānot be but a singular
commendation for any that excell in both, so that hin∣der
not other more necessarie sciences. As touching the
knowledge of the Countrie wherein men trauaile, wee
haue in other places prescribed sufficient rules to make
prouision, and to remooue inconueniences, so as for
breuitie the same may be omitted here.</P>
<P>The fourth duetie is of Charitie. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth point.</NOTE> hauing got∣ten
licence of their Prince, &amp; friends to whom such owe
subiection (otherwise their pretēce will seeme <HI>Irregular</HI>)
they must accommodate themselues of all things need∣full
for their trauaile;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To be well accomodated of all things needfull.</NOTE> the chiefe whereof is only proui∣sion
of monie: which by billes of exchange, is the safest
and most profitable way, the course also being com∣mon.
Onely this, let such take order they may haue
sufficient of Marchants wheresoeuer they shall come:
for want breedeth many inconueniences. And there∣fore
let such proportion their estate with the largest be∣fore
trauaile: the which must bee according to euerie
ones course, estate and retinewe. For, some Countries
are verie chargeable generally; where either dearth,
much riotte, or troubles reigne. Moreouer, of what
State soeuer a man be, it is not good to trauaile with
a greater traine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To trauell in a priuate fashion most gainefull.</NOTE> then neede requires. For, it is vnpossi∣ble
that such an one shall attaine vnto the light of many
things and secrets: which more priuate men may. Nei∣ther
can it quit cost, since the voluntarie action of any
subiect (vnlesse in some publike seruice of their Prince
and Countrie) ought to bee contented with meane
pompe. For, such in a strange Countrie are subiect to
<PB N="41" REF="31"/>
scoffes; and in an Enemies or a Neuters Countrey,
Iealousie and publique eyes will bee looking on
such.</P>
<P>In the fift place it is required,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fift point.</NOTE> that they resolue to
goe into such Countreys, the state of which may best
like the State of which they are, and which may af∣ford
them best gaine of knowledge and experience;
either to reforme in them defects of nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Coun∣tries men must resolue to tra∣uell in.</NOTE> or to
benefite most their Common weale. And though
the enemies policie auaileth most vnto the State of
ones Countrey, yet when such that haue made their
abode there, shall returne, it is doubtfull, how accep∣table
that may bee. For commonly, great suspicion
tendeth on such long after, vnlesse in the <HI>interim</HI> of
their trauailes they carrie themselues with risenti∣ment
and respect. The Enemies of euery State are
two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two enemies of an estate vp∣on cause.</NOTE> such as stand out in Religion, and contrary opi∣nion,
in the seruice of God: and such as iniustice, ei∣ther
of not due reuerēce exhibited, or of defamation,
or of preiudice, in goods or persons really, or collate∣rally,
dayly worketh amongst Princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A twofold cō∣sideration of Countries friends.</NOTE> But of Coun∣tries
to be trauailed into, there is a double considera∣tion,
whose friendships are auaileable to the Com∣mon
weale: to weet, Those that neighborhood, Re∣ligion,
aliance, perpetuall vnitie, and such like natural
and ciuill bonds, haue conioyned in loue, league, and
confederacie: and, Those which merchandise, mu∣tuall
commerce, and such like foraine policie to be∣nefit
each others Land, haue linked in amitie: Which
also are by so much the more fast tied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Coun∣treys afford most gaine to trauell in.</NOTE> by how much
one standeth in neede of another, how farre soeuer
they bee distant off. In these, Trauailers shall reape
<PB N="42" REF="32"/>
most profit &amp; contentation for their Common weale.
For as he that would learne any facultie, had neede to
studie the best books that write thereof; so a Trauailer
that laboreth for the good of his Countrey, must fre∣quent
those places, that afford most points of needfull
knowledge and experience. And though a wise man
may collect, out of euery Coūtrie he abideth in, some
profitable obseruations, yet the neighbour countreys
of this Iland yeeld more requisite considerations than
others. Hereof it commeth, that by the motions of
<HI>France, Spaine, Germany,</HI> the Lowe Countreys, <HI>Bur∣gundie,</HI>
and <HI>Denmarke,</HI> this Realme is in action, &amp; made
sensible, either of trouble, detriment, or quiet; whereas
the troubles of <HI>Muscouie,</HI> the free Townes, high <HI>Ger∣many,
Italy, Barbary,</HI> the dominions of the Turke and
Persian, incommodate this nation little, but by diuer∣ting
of the trade of merchants another way. But as
touching those Countreys, which afford particular
gaine of knowledge and information of maners and
ciuill cariage, these Trauailers shal find in euery good
and orderly gouernment thorow Christendome, but
singularly here at home, &amp; in the Courts of <HI>France,</HI> &amp;
Vniuersities of <HI>Germany, Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Burgundie.</HI> And
though <HI>Italie</HI> haue the common prayse for these, yet
the inconueniences and corruptions, that are mixed
with the ciuilitie of that Countrey, may other wayes
perswade men of iudgement. And since I seeme to
contrary the opinions of many worthy Gentlemen,
let it not be impertinent here to consider some speci∣all
things cōcerning that State. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why men tra∣uaile into Italy.</NOTE> <HI>Italy</HI> moueth most
of our Trauailers to go and visit, of any other State
in the world: And not without cause, it being an an∣cient
<PB N="43" REF="32"/>
nurcerie and shop of libertie, the which to the
affects of men is precious and estimable. Moreouer,
I find amongst an infinite number of licencious mo∣uers,
fiue seemly halers of men thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue specialties in the commē∣dation of Italy.</NOTE> hardly found
otherwhere all together. The first is the temperatnesse <MILESTONE N="1"/>
of the aire, and fruitfulnesse of the soyle, with answera∣ble
delights, from, and in the Countrey. Yet we see
how slender a thing that is to drawe honourable
personages, vnlesse necessitie for health sake presse
them. The second is the speaking of the tongue and <MILESTONE N="2"/>
residencing in the notable Vniuersities there found.
As concerning the tongue, although it bee an ex∣cellent
and eloquent speach, of many other it may
bee to vs least estimable. Neuerthelesse, in vaine it
is to goe so farre for that, which at home with small
paines may singularly bee attained vnto. Moreo∣uer,
the Vniuersities there are little beneficiall for a
Generalist, such as these Trauailers not vnworthily
arrogate. The third is the variable manners and in∣clinations <MILESTONE N="3"/>
of the people, to ciuilitie and humanitie,
the which by right of prescription belongeth to that
nation of all the world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">England the best Court.</NOTE> Yet considering the Court of
<HI>England</HI> at this day is the most compleat in all things
and vnto all people of other nations &amp; Courts in the
world, and that which can make men (if they be as stu∣dious
therin, as abroad, to enforme themselues) per∣fect
in ciuility &amp; good maners, &amp; obseruant enough;
both for that the puritie of Religion (which is the best
Ciuilian) and the long continuance thereof with vs,
hath framed our Nobilitie in fashion, and our Prince
in State, to recommend the Court of <HI>England</HI> aboue
anie that I could euer heare of, in all points that are
<PB N="44" REF="33"/>
honorable and commendable: This is but in shew a
<MILESTONE N="4"/> fond entiser. The fourth, is the multiplex and diffe∣rent
gouernments, and sundrie policies there found;
namely, of <HI>Rome,</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> of
<HI>Millane,</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> of <HI>Mantoa,</HI> of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> of <HI>Placen∣tia</HI>
and <HI>Parma,</HI> of <HI>Vrbine,</HI> and others. But these be∣ing
different gouernments from ours, and better de∣scribed
already, than any one Trauailer is able to pen
downe: though this bee of the fiue the principall,
yet how little it booteth our Sate, I leaue to Politici∣ans
<MILESTONE N="5"/> to resolue. The fift and last, is the speciall gallerie
of monuments and olde aged memorials of histo∣ries,
records of persons and things to bee seene tho∣rowout
the Countrey. But this being a fantasticall
attracter, and a glutton-feeder of the appetite, rather
than of necessarie knowledge, I will mention no fur∣ther
thereof. Notwithstanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Italy a corrup¦ter of men.</NOTE> all these together
are auaileable, were it not for the infinite corrupti∣ons,
almost ineuitable, that inuest Trauailers after
small abode there; as it is reported, I know not vpon
what ground, of the Realme of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Wherefore,
let these honorable Trauailers frequuent the best pla∣ces:
and if so bee they must needes goe thither, let
them beware of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rome the Forge of euil.</NOTE> the Forge of euery policie,
that setteth Princes at oddes, or that continueth them
in debates, little or much: the tempter of Subiects to
ciuil dissensions, &amp; the seller of all wickednes and hea∣thenish
impieties, or the machediuell of euill policies
and practises, that are vnmeete subiects for these wor∣thy
Trauailers to spend their time about. As for any
good thing, which that State can benefit a Trauailer
by, I haue not heard of, otherwise than the loathing
<PB N="45" REF="33"/>
of the same afterwards: for which pretence no man
hath warrant to trauaile thither, or other-where.</P>
<P>Now in the last and sixt place it is required of all
Trauailers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sixt point.</NOTE> that they demaund licence and fauour at
the hands of God, vpon these grounds to protect and
blesse them in their iourney; and not without the
good leaue of their Prince and parents. For if it be
a commendable point and duetie for a man to aske
his Parents, Tutor, Master, and Prince leaue to tra∣uaile,
then is it the office of a man, to desire the same
at the hands of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Without the blessing of God men tra∣uaile in vaine.</NOTE> who is the Souereigne of all
those. For without his pleasure and consent alasse
where are our motions to any good acte, or the
meanes by which they are aduanced or preserued?
So that though this be the last considered of vs, yet
is it the first and best of all things to be respected and
performed. For since knowledge, learning, experi∣ence,
honour, health, prosperitie, and all other bles∣sings,
be the mediate or immediate gifts of God, it is a
foolishnes for any to perswade, and blesse their owne
actions without consulting with God the eternall
reason, that guideth all things to their proper endes;
yea, the dereigled Trauailers to labour in vaine, and
for a punishment to returne home no better, than
when they went foorth; and peraduenture in many
things worse. For, as the obseruance of his reuealed
will encourageth man to goe forward in all godli∣nesse,
and commendable actions; so the neglect there∣of
maketh him taste of his secret iudgements, prepa∣red
for the carelesse and wilfull breakers of his com∣maund
and will. Hitherto concerning the generall
dueties before trauaile.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="34"/>
In the <HI>interim</HI> of trauaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the <HI>interim</HI> of trauaile sixe things are to be obserued.</NOTE> there likewise resteth sixe
generall obseruations of these Trauailers for the ad∣uancement of their peregrination: Whereof the first
is to attempt nothing without consulting with their
conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first.</NOTE> and imploring the fauour of God, that
euery action may haue a promise of blessing, and ac∣ceptation
aswell among those with whom such shall
liue, as of their owne Prince and Countrey, when
happily they shall returne. The neglect whereof o∣peneth
the gate to infinite dangers and euils. For,
the feare of God, which is an adiunct to this duetie,
serueth for a curbe to restraine all improuident &amp; vio∣lent
courses, that carie men into inconueniences, and
for a guide to aduise them of all things warrantable,
honourable and pleasing in the sight of God &amp; men:
and therefore it is requirable, that these diligently e∣uery
day priuately conferre and consult with God in
their spirits and prayers made vnto him. The first
thus regarding the stay of the soule;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The se<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond.</NOTE> so the second of∣fice
respecteth the good health of the bodie, where∣of
Trauailers are not to be carelesse &amp; improuident:
for he that dependeth on fortune, exposeth himselfe
to many deceits, perils, &amp; losse of time. I therfore ob∣serue
three preuenters of mischiefes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three preuen∣ters of mis∣chiefes in tra∣uailing.</NOTE> &amp; inconuenien∣ces
to the safety &amp; health of Trauailers, namely, Diet,
Trauailing or Exercise, and moderation of Passions.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diet.</NOTE> let the diet of euery man be so moderate, as
neither the ayre wherein such liue afflict them, either
with exceeding heate or cold, the which in some
countreys Trauailers shal meete with, but by little and
little accustome their bodies to endure the hardnes of
the Countrey clime, which to contrary bodies is very
<PB N="47" REF="34"/>
dangerous suddainly. For which cause, <HI>Auicen</HI> the no∣table
naturalist auouched, that if a Scythian should vi∣olētly,
&amp; in a very short space be trāsported into <HI>India,</HI>
either he would suddainly fall sicke or die: the which
he would not necessarily bee, so be it he tooke time
in trauaile by land or sea. Neither let any continue
long in those places, where the aire is pestiferous, vn∣lesse
their bodies can away therwith. For which cause
the Cynicke <HI>Diogenes</HI> reioyced after his banishment,
that he made a good change to be exiled from <HI>Sinope</HI>
(a most piercing and sharpe ayre about the confines
of the <HI>Euxine</HI> sea) to liue afterwards in <HI>Greece.</HI> And
lastly, let the diet of all men, for eating, drinking, slee∣ping,
clothing, and such like, be answerable to euery
ones nature, that such may alwaies keep themselues in
one temper, if possibly, Winter and Summer; the
which is the greatest preseruatiue of mans health.</P>
<P>The second preuenter of inconuenience of health
is trauailing from place to place, and dayly exercise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exercise.</NOTE>
when such are abiding in any place, with moderati∣on
and respect. For, ouer-much labour distill the
<HI>vitall</HI> and <HI>animal</HI> spirits, which is most dangerous.
For the trauailing from place to place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixe things in iourneying to be regarded.</NOTE> sixe things
are to bee regarded. First, to haue in iourneying
(if neede require) faithfull and honest guides and <MILESTONE N="1"/>
companions: and in speciall cases, let such change
rayment with their guides. Secondly, let them of <MILESTONE N="2"/>
two wayes take the least dangerous, and most passe∣able:
so as alwayes the neerest way is not the best
to bee chosen. Hereof the Germanes haue a say∣ing,
<HI>Gut vneg vnih vnar nie krumb:</HI> and wee
haue a Prouerbe not much vnlike, The farther
<PB N="48" REF="35"/>
<MILESTONE N="3"/> way about, the neerer way home. Thirdly, in long
iourneys to be prouided of meat and drinke, and such
like prouisions. Therefore those that passe thorow
the deserts of <HI>Arabia, Tartarie, Persia, Scythia,</HI> and the
Carouans of <HI>Swecia</HI> and <HI>Muscouie,</HI> make large proui∣sions:
and for some passages, as in the sea of Sande
in <HI>Africa,</HI> and other places, men are guided by the
Compasse, standing in need of Pilots for the passage.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> Fourthly, to make prouision against the extreamities
of heate and colde, that in some places are outragi∣ous,
in which the seasons of the yeere are to be respe∣cted.
Wherefore he that will trauaile thorow <HI>Swecia,</HI>
and <HI>Muscouie</HI> on sleddes, vnlesse he shall rub his no∣sthrils
with the snowe and yee, to recall and settle his
motiue spirits, he shall be in extreame danger to lose
them thorow the excesse of colde. And in the yeere
1498, of seuenty thousand Turkes that made an in∣rode
into <HI>Muscouie,</HI> fourtie thousand suddenly were
frozen to death. Whereupon the Turkes verily be∣leeue,
that the Polonians and Muscouites are defen∣ced
by the celestiall powers. No person is able to
trauell out of doores in the <HI>Troglodites</HI> land, with∣out
shooes, the ground is so scalding hote: insomuch
that they roste their meat, by putting the same into a
brasse vessell, and setting it in the Sunne. And in the
kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Champain,</HI> the heat is so great,
and ayre so pestiferous, during Iune, Iuly, and Au∣gust,
till the first raine of September, that the better
sort will not trauaile, though the King commaund
them, from home. Let these suffice for Trauailers to
beware thereof, vnlesse vpon vrgent necessitie, and
<MILESTONE N="5"/> with good respect. Fiftly, to be prouided against the
<PB N="49" REF="35"/>
rage of wilde beastes, and of robbers, the which by
good companie is the safest way alwayes. Lastly, to <MILESTONE N="6"/>
arriue early at their Inne or baite, and to looke that
the chamber where such lodge be well seated and de∣fended:
to haue in their chamber a Tinder boxe to
light fire or candle; and finally, vnlesse need require, to
dissemble departure from the Inne. Of this last, a
man cannot bee too carefull.</P>
<P>The third and last preuenter of sickenesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moderation of Passion.</NOTE> and
censurer of health is passion, which is quadruplex
(according to the foure complexions generall of
men) namely, Mirth, Sorow, Anger, and Patience: the
which remedie or continue euery distemperature of
the mind. And as, <HI>per antiperistasin,</HI> bodily discords
are tuned and appeased, so it is of the mind. For Mirth
is a cordiall to sorowfull and melancholicke bodies;
wheras sorow so much continueth that humor, as de∣speratnesse,
or frensie, or both is to be feared. Sorow, in
meane, maketh sanguine bodies, and merrily disposed,
wise, &amp; full of respect. But of these two, mirth is euer∣more
to be cōmended, so it be not ouer-light &amp; vnci∣uil.
So chollerick bodies, seeing they are fretting &amp; an∣gry
at light occasiōs, let them cure their imperfectiōs
of nature by patience: for such are otherwise vnsocia∣ble
&amp; dangerous to be cōuersed with, as endangering
themselues. For I neuer saw so cholericke a man, but
hee hath met with his match: and this of strangers is
reproueable. So those of flegmaticke spirits that pati∣ence
hath enfeebled, that such want the harts of men,
as ordained to suffer all things, though this be a ciuill
&amp; singular vertue in Trauailers, yet let none be in ex∣treamity
so patient, as it make himself a sot &amp; a foole,
<PB N="50" REF="36"/>
to heare his God, and his Prince &amp; Country, and his
honor wronged, whē as honestly and fitly he may, &amp;
ought to make resistance or apprehension. Finally, as
the tyrannizing of these, subiect many to incurable e∣uils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law of God the best Counsailer and Physician of the soule.</NOTE> bringing to consumption the <HI>vitall</HI> and <HI>animall</HI>
spirits: so ought euery worthy Trauailer to preuent
these inward mischiefs by godly and timely counsell,
that those slie passions frustrate not his enterprise.</P>
<P>Now in the third place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third.</NOTE> let euery Trauailer bee of
such honest and seemely carriage, towards all with
whom they conuerse, for ciuilitie and humanity, as
neither contempt, derision, irrision, pertinacitie in dis∣course,
bitternesse, or no respect be vsed. For these
be dissoluers of friendship, and daungerous perturba∣tions
for anie stranger, in the Countrey of an other.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth.</NOTE> it is the duetie of all men to fit and ap∣plie
themselues, not onely to their maners and cu∣stomes
with whom they liue; but singularly to haue
an eye of diligent watch to their particular affaires as
well for knowledge and encrease of experience, as
for the retention of a sound and holy conscience. As
touching the first branch, let no man loose the raigns
of his owne lust and fancie amongst strangers, so that
he expose himselfe to reproche &amp; scandall. And con∣sidering
many nations are apt to deceiue, a man must
liue warily with them, taking heed he giue no offence.
And though the customes of other nations, where a
man liueth, are to be followed, yet in the case of God,
or of a mans own conscience, ther ought to be a scru∣ple.
For as it becommeth none to leaue the truth, or to
exercise any wicked actiō there; so neither let any fol∣low
the beastly guises, or wicked customs of the coū∣trey,
<PB N="51" REF="36"/>
wherby honesty &amp; good maners may be corrup∣ted:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What customs are to be fol∣lowed in other countreys.</NOTE>
but in euery State to obserue thē, as Diet, Appa∣rell,
Gesture, Curtesie, and such like, which in some
places are precisely to be obserued. But as cōcerning
that other branch, let men auoid to sacrifice or do re∣uerence
to any Idole or Hobgoblin. For though ma∣ny
haue so large a cōscience, that they perswade thē∣selues,
so they keepe their hearts to God, they may
bend their knee, and bow themselues before such
trash without hurt at all, yet God will not forget
the hypocrisie of such. For whoso vseth any out∣ward
reuerence to any Idole or diuel, incurreth the
wrath of God, and is thereby made subiect to all im∣perfections
and euils. And if in ciuil matters many be
wonderful respectiue, that they will not come in pre∣sence,
when they know for certaintie, that they shall
see or heare their M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stris, Prince, or friend dishono∣red,
how much more ought al men in the case of God
to be precise; not only to shun the sight &amp; hearing of
their God blasphemed, and dishonored by their Mas∣ses,
and estimation of reliques &amp; images, but to seeke
to right the same if it lay in their powers?</P>
<P>But cōsidering no stranger hath warrant, at this day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Customes in forraine States, how wicked soeuer, are to be pub∣likely with∣stood.</NOTE>
to oppose himselfe against them in their owne coun∣trey,
let him rather abiure so heathenish a place,
where he cannot liue freely, than endure the sight
thereof: yea, though some thinke themselues dis∣chargeable,
if they trauaile, and not both see &amp; heare
them. If there be any such, let them imitate that wor∣thy
<HI>Themistocles:</HI> who hauing, in the vaine yeeres of
his youth, accustomed himselfe to learn an endure the
sight of many things, which in nature hee abhorred,
<PB N="52" REF="37"/>
which gaue him the smacke of an excellent memory,
yet in the better time of his yeeres he did spend more
time, to learne to forget things vnnecessarie and euill;
than in learning that which was honorable; &amp; found
it more difficult &amp; hard for him. For, the knowledge of
much euill tempteth man ful oft, &amp; withdraweth the
hart more out of the way, than the strength of natu∣rall
reason can set him aright againe long after.</P>
<P>Fiftly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fift.</NOTE> let euery one, in his calling, exercise such or∣nate
and seemely qualities of the body, that both may
inable them for ciuill conuersation, as also for auaile
in things requireable in Nobilitie and Gentlemen.
And of the nobler sort it is required alwayes, that
they discouer spirited bodies, and more actiue minds
than other Gentlemen, labouring to perfect them by
much industry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What things are chiefly to be exercised.</NOTE> The things to be exercised, are, horse∣manship,
managing of all sorts of weapons, musicke,
dancing, Poetrie, limming and portraiting, vaulting,
running, &amp; practising the fiue strengths of the arme,
namely, griping, lifting, thrusting and holding out at
the armes end, pulling and drawing, and throwing or
darting. These by practise wil giue vigor to the defect
of nature: for by nature it is impossible to be strong
in all, the one being contrary to the other: the bene∣fit
wherof is so great, that little men shall haue no dis∣aduantage,
by the greatest persons in the world, in ex∣ercising,
or single encountring, so the one practise and
the other neuer. But these, being recreations, may
not hinder more necessary studies, though to excell
in them be honorable, and right excellent.</P>
<P>The sixt and last generall duetie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sixt.</NOTE> which is the ve∣ry
point which euery Trauailer ought to lay his
<PB N="53" REF="37"/>
witts about, To get knowledge for the bettering of him∣selfe
and his Countrie: This, being the obiect of their
Countries defects and the subiect of Trauailers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixe principall heads of know¦ledge which are to be learned in trauelling.</NOTE> in a
word containeth Six generall heads, to be learned and
vnderstood: namely, the tongue, the Nature of the peo∣ple,
the Countrey, the Customes; the Gouernment of
the State; &amp; the secrets of the same: the which are to be
sought out wheresoeuer these shall come. And though
some one of these inuest many with the honorable title
of Trauailers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meanes whereon all po∣licie is grown∣ded.</NOTE> yet in how much any shall be found de∣fectiue
in any of these, by so farre is hee short of the
compleatnesse and true estimation that apprertaineth to
Trauailers Regular and honorable. These things are
the vtensils, and materialls of States men, concerning
forraine matters: the which many actiue mindes though
sitting at home are well read in: and except it bee for
the secrets and other occurrences, alteratiōs &amp; changes,
the difference is not much betweene the home States
man, not hauing spent some time in trauaile, &amp; the com∣pleate
Trauailer, for forraine matters. Yet, herein hath
a Trauailer the start of a home States man, which is fed
by aduertisements only, and is ledde by other mens eyes:
Euen as a Soldier in Action may presume of better euēt,
then the Theorist, whose booke rules, in accidentall
things, faile many times as in particular motions. For,
the eye hath a more perfect sense in iudgement then
the eare, if the same be rightly considered by iudge∣ment.</P>
<P>Of these sixe the tongue is the first by right to be dis∣coursed
of:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tongue the first point to be learned.</NOTE> the right knowledge whereof is somewhat
more then wee required such to learne before they vn∣dertooke
trauaile. For, now in the <HI>interim</HI> of trauaile
<PB N="54" REF="38"/>
it is requisite, that Trauailers grow in perfection: other∣wise
such as stay at home may ranke with them, which is
reproachfull. The perfection wherof consisteth in three
things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three perfecti∣ons in Langua¦ges.</NOTE> namely, in vnderstanding, speaking, and writing
the same.</P>
<P>To vnderstand a tongue perfectly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the vn∣derstanding is of a tongue.</NOTE> is not barely to vn∣derstand
what is read or heard pronounced, but to ob∣serue
the peculiar phrase, idiom &amp; constructiō of words,
and singularly to note whereof the tongue hath his spe∣ciall
deriuation if it be a deriuatiue, or his composition:
wherin Trauailers cānot be too good Grāmarians. For,
in these dayes there is the true confusion of <HI>Babell</HI> and
languages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of all Languages at this day.</NOTE> through the world either deriuatiuely, or
compositiuely, or both. And though at all times the like
might be auouched, howsoeuer there was generally
held many ancient Tongues, as the Hebrue, the Chal∣dean
or Assyrian, the Arabian, and the Egyptian; yet by
their characters and composition it is euident that they
were all confounded, or perished, sauing the Hebrue,
which was the most auncient of all the rest; and the
spring from which the rest deriuatiuely or compositiue∣ly
are descended; necessitie and imitation, being the
parent of these and succeeding languages. For, <HI>A∣dam</HI>
the good Grammarian of the Hebrue tongue, ap∣propriated
words, not <HI>ad placitum,</HI> but according to the
nature of things; and framed a certaine idiome of speach
which in his dayes was generally spoken till the confusi∣on
of Languages.</P>
<P>So, since, other Monarches of the world haue exco∣gitated
words according to the light of nature, and ope∣ration
of things vnknowne, to perfect their deriued lan∣guages
by composition and meere inuention.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="38"/>
Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hebrue tongue the Phoenician, or Sarmatian Character.</NOTE> as we see the simple and vncorrupt Hebrue
Tongue was the originall, to other Languages, and sin∣gularly
to the Phoenician, Chaldean, &amp; Assyrian, (these
two only differing in that the Assyrian had the purer
dialect and rellish of the Hebrue) so euerie Monarchie
haue arrogated the deriuation and composition of the
Tongues subiected vnto them. Hereof it comes, that the
foure Monarchiall tongues are accompted originals, by
vsurpatiō, and not of proprietie: namely, the Chaldean or
Assyrian, which in the first Monarchie was famous, &amp; to
particular States subiected gaue words and manners of
speach: Howbeit, the Armenian, and Arabian langua∣ges
held their own though in some wordes and phrases
they might be by commerce cōfounded, as we see other
neighbour Countries through the world borrowe and
search from others to appropriate their tongues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnder the second.</NOTE> So was
it of the second Monarchie, the Persian, when not
onely the Chaldean becāe corrupted, but that Language
also was driuen to search after the phrases and words of
the Persian, till the third Monarchie came vp by <HI>Alex∣ander,</HI>
namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnder the third,</NOTE> the Grecian: the singularitie of which
tongue for proprietie of words hath deriued it selfe into
the veines of all Ciuil Countries, but singularly of States
tributary; making the fourth Monarchie glorious, name∣ly
the Romaine. And this Monarchie stretched it self far
and neere.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnder the fourth.</NOTE> We see the generall esteeme of the Latine
tongue, through <HI>Europe;</HI> giuing as it were deriuation,
vnto the Italian and Spanish tongues, with many proper
and apt words; making also <HI>France, Germanie, England</HI>
and other Iles &amp; Coūtries fertile by the proper idiom of
that tong, as tributary States to the same, especially wher
<HI>Colonies</HI> or gouernmēts be established. Herof it coms to
<PB N="56" REF="39"/>
passe that our English tongue hath a smacke of the Bri∣tanish
(which is a deriuatiue from the Grecian or Na∣tolian tongue)
of the Latine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deriuation and Cōposition of English tongue.</NOTE> of the Scottish, and Pictish,
of the Danish, Gothish, Vandalish and Norwegian, of
the Norman and French tongues; and also of the Fle∣mish
and Wallonish: which though not by conquest,
yet since the reigne of <HI>Henrie</HI> the first, by permissiō haue
inhabited this Land whereof our tongue rellisheth also:
as in these dayes (through commerce and affaires) of the
Italian and Spanish and Irish tongues, howbeit we hold
that the Brittish tongue is one of the Eleuen mother
tongues in <HI>Europe.</HI> In like sort stāds the French tongue,
the Italian, Spanish, Scottish, and Dutch (though of
others the most pure) being fallats and good gallimau∣fries
of others tongues according either as they haue
beene conquered and gouerned by strangers, or thorow
comemerce stand in neede of one anothers wordes and
phrases.</P>
<P>Wherof it may be concluded, that euerie language
in his owne Countrey is most honorable, and equally
ancient, though it be a a deriuatiue, <HI>quoad tempus,</HI> but
not <HI>quoad perfectionem.</HI> Neuerthelesse, we see some
Languages more general then other, &amp; more esteemed
here in <HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason why one tongue is esteemed aboue another.</NOTE> and that for two causes. One through
situatiō of the Coūtrie, which maketh other neighbour
Nations of necessitie acquaint themselues with one an∣others
Language (the which chanceth to few Ilands) that
they may trafficke and haue commerce. Hence the
French, the high Duch, and the Sclavonian tongues
are generall tongues, passing through many kingdomes
and States. The like may also bee alleaged for some o∣ther
States within the Continent that haue been at any
<PB N="57" REF="39"/>
time great, and enforced others to seeke to them. The
other cause is thorow the perfection of the tongue, as
of copiousnes &amp; learning cōtained therin, the which
also make the same generally to bee regarded for ne∣cessitie
of knowledge, or for perfecting their owne
barbarisme. Hence the Greeke and Latine tongues
are so generally taught and learned, thorow the grea∣test
parts of the whole world: the words and phrases
whereof are so well knowen, that the Princes of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
negotiate and contract in writing in the Latine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why men treat in the Latine tongue for the most part.</NOTE>
as the Turke with Christian Princes in the Greeke,
as also for that princes Soueraigne will not yeeld at
this day the honour to other Kings than to those
that are indifferent, and cannot bee challenged of
any people. And hence haue the French and Itali∣ans
gotten the starte of vs, in that their tongue was
sooner refined, and cast into bookes of many arts and
histories and points of knowledge: though at this
day the English tongue draweth neere to the glory
of the best of them. Lastly, hence it commeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause why we esteem the Italian tongue so much.</NOTE> that
the yong Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> affect so much the
Italian tongue; For that containeth spirit of inuenti∣on
good phrase, vtterance, and delightfull matter to
their appetites.</P>
<P>But to returne to our point, let Trauailers (hauing
made obseruance of these things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the speaking of a tongue is.</NOTE> concerning the
state of the tongue of that countrey wherein they
trauaile) moreouer take paines in the speaking, ac∣cording
to the naturall accent and tune of the coun∣trey.
And as, by much reading and labour, a man
shall attaine to the vnderstanding, and consequently,
by a diligent obseruation, to the writing; so by confe∣rence
<PB N="58" REF="40"/>
and much parley the speaking of the tongue
will be soone attained vnto. And in speaking of the
Tongues, euery Countreys accent, time and tune is
best without affectation: Hence wee see those that
speake the high Dutch, do striue to vtter their words
highly, and with spirit, not hudling as the <HI>French,</HI> but
distinctly, as the Italian &amp; Spaniard, yet not with that
chaunting manner. Likewise in speaking the Latine
there is a more ciuill elocution and cariage of the
mouth, than in speaking the high Dutch, or Sclauo∣nish,
&amp; with greater tēperance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the wri∣ting of a toung is.</NOTE> yet with some affecta∣tion
like the Italian &amp; Spaniard: euen so in writing e∣legantly,
euery tongue in effect hauing peculiar Cha∣racters,
men must follow the most esteemed fashion
both in framing the letters &amp; sentences, according to
the Orthography of the country. I meane, hauing oc∣casion to write letters, let such vse that kind of hand
most common and commendable, and those phrases
which in letters almost euery nation hath peculiar, as
in sub. and superscriptiōs. For, the least error in these,
may either offer wrong to the party written vnto, or
discouer weaknes &amp; imperfectiō reproueable in Tra∣uailers.
Lastly, as the vnderstāding of a tongue is gottē
by good Authors, principles, &amp; common conference
with men: so to speake the tongue well it behoueth a
Trauailer to frequēt those places &amp; persons, where &amp;
amongst whō the tongue best flourisheth. And as the
Court &amp; Citie excel in the dialect, and fine phrase; so
the Countrey phrase &amp; words are of no lesse esteeme
and regard: in so much as no man can be accounted
worthily excellent in any tongue, that wants discreti∣on
to speake Court-like and Country-like, when, and
where it is requisite. Moreouer, considering the ma∣nifold
<PB N="59" REF="40"/>
Countries that Trauailers may come into, it
may be demanded here (although we haue long plod∣ded
vpō the tongue already)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether eue∣ry tongue be of equal impor∣tance for tra∣uailers.</NOTE> whether euery tongue be
of equal importāce, to be perfectly vnderstood &amp; spo∣ken
of these Trauailers? For answere wherof, I presup∣pose
two rules: first, it is impossible for any man to be
an obseruer of things required in these Trauailers, &amp;
an excellent linguist in al tongues, considering the in∣finite
time such an one must spend in the gaining of
thē. Secondly, there is no such necessity for a Trauai∣ler
to learn them all; wherfore let him busie himselfe
about such only as may stand his State &amp; Country in
best auaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Those toungs are best, that profit most.</NOTE> if so be he shal happily come to prefermēt.
This resteth in the iudgemēt of Trauailers chiefly, To
make election: for sometimes the state of things alter,
that necessitate a State to haue in recōmendation the
general speakers of such and such tongues. But for this
Coūtry, no one rule of certainty can perpetually hold
to all men, considering many Trauailers prescribe vn∣to
thē diuers ends: as some the knowledge only of the
tongues; others trauaile for knowledge contēplatiue,
to whō the Hebrue, Greek, Latine, Chaldie, &amp; Syriack
tongues are most precious, wherin all ancient monu∣ments
of things past to bee knowen, are treasured vp;
which rauish more the mind, then the knowledge of
things present, by how much they prognosticate fu∣ture
euents. But for these honourable Trauailers (in
regard of their pretence) the Latine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tongues most needfull for this State.</NOTE> the French, and
the Spanish tongues are most necessary, and like to
hold. So the alteration of things causeth a necessity for
a season to trauaile in the Italian, as at this time the
<HI>Germane</HI> and the Lowe Countrey language, that
of <HI>Denmarke, Muscouie,</HI> and such like confrontire
<PB N="60" REF="41"/>
tongues: The which let Trauailers busie themselues
about, more then other tongues, that for illustration
and contemplatiue knowledge, and learning, are to
bee respected, whensoeuer it is requisite. Let these
things suffice for the first point to bee respected of
Trauailers Voluntary.</P>
<P>2 The second is the nature of the people of that
Nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the people; the second point.</NOTE> in which they trauaile; which is the generall
inclination, sway, maners, and fashion of thē in euery
common motion, or action, whereby may be disco∣uered
imperfection in things euil, or apprehension of
that which is good: by the ensample whereof other
Nations may generally reforme things amisse, and
establish their policie, euen as Trauailers in particu∣lar
may fashion themselues for all seasons, places and
persons to be compleat, in ciuill conuersation in the
iudgement of the world. Now that Trauailers may
discouer this amongst the people of a Nation or
State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue discoue∣rers of the na∣ture of people.</NOTE> let them consider fiue things: First, whether
the people bee ciuill or barbarous. Secondly, whe∣ther
they be free or seruile. Thirdly, whether religi∣ous
or profane. Fourthly, whether warlike or effe∣minate.
And fiftly, of what condition of bodie, and
disposition of mind. These containe the maners, na∣ture,
and inclination of all people in a generalitie; of
which we will discourse in order.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first disco∣uerer of the peoples nature.</NOTE> And first, therefore,
let Trauailers consider, whether the people in gene∣rall
be ciuill or barbarous; and that whether by disci∣pline
(the best Ciuilian Master)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two causes of ciuility or bar∣barousnesse.</NOTE> or by naturall tempe∣rature
of bodies. Such are the Grecians, and those of
the Iles of <HI>Iapan</HI> and <HI>Chios:</HI> as on the contrary side,
the people of <HI>Africa, America, Magellanica,</HI> and those
<PB N="61" REF="41"/>
of Northeast <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> by nature barbarists.
The vse of which obseruation, for the Common∣weale,
may appeare by these two rules; First that ciuill<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules of policy touching the nature of peo∣ple.</NOTE>
nations, gouerned by lawes diuine and humane writ∣ten,
may either be feared for enemies, or trusted for
friends in case they be neighbours, and of the same
Religion and of good abilitie. Secondly, that barba∣rous
people are neuer good faithfull friends, but for
their profit, being euer wauering and treacherous,
nor if enemies other than mortall; yet if their power
be not ouer-great, are easily vanquished.</P>
<P>But the priuate vse that Trauailers must make to
themselues hereby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The priuate vse that Trauailers are to make.</NOTE> is to chase away such barbarous∣nesse
and rudenesse as possesseth them, to establish a
more humane and sociable carriage. For better dis∣couerie
of these, let Trauailers marke the gesture, ap∣parell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meanes to in∣terpret the na∣ture of people.</NOTE> decencie, conuersation, diet, feeding, giuing of
honour, and all other actions of the people of a coun∣trey,
one towards another; regarding. or contemning
all moral vices, with better iudgement than those fan∣tastickes,
which bring home with them some apish
ceremonies of curtesie, and strange fashions of appa∣rell,
but nothing else, to giue them commendations
at their returnes. It may not be vnknowen moreouer,
that there is no nation in the world but may be redu∣ced
to ciuilitie, and forced in time to put off barba∣rousnesse,
seeing in all people God hath sowen the
seedes of that which is good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difference of natures.</NOTE> within the furrowes and
fieldes of euery ones heart: which groweth more or
lesse according to the pleasure of the seedeman, ma∣nifested
in the proportioning of nature, whereof eue∣ry
climate hath a seuerall stroke, as being an instru∣ment
<PB N="62" REF="42"/>
whereby God frameth capabilitie more or lesse
to comprehend the same. Hence we see, those that in∣habite
vnder the intemperate Zones hot or cold bee
more brutish, simple, and sauage than others between
the Tropicks, and in the temperate. So also it is to be
vnderstood, that no nation in the world, how Court∣like
soeuer, but hath the dregs and lees of barbarous
inciuility; and that many heathen people, by the light
of nature meerly inscribed in their hearts, rest for en∣samples
and reproofes to many ciuill nations gouer∣ned
by a diuiner knowledge, in points of ciuil actions
&amp; conuersation. For proofe whereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No nation but may be tainted with barbarous fashions.</NOTE> behold how the
English, Scottish, French, Italians, &amp; Spanish which
are the most reformed &amp; courtlike people, are tainted
with some blemish of barbarousnesse, the which of o∣ther
heathen nations they might learne to reforme.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The considera∣tion thereof.</NOTE>
And though of all ciuill nations we here may iustly
chalenge preeminence, yet how barbarous are we in
many things? namely, the Commons of this land, in
the entertainement of strangers, pursuing them with
the vncharitablenesse of hatred and despight, like the
Lithuanians, that vse neither faith nor ciuility to them.
Neither are we alone: for the Commons of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spaine</HI> carie as hard a hand toward strangers;
whereas the African heathen Negros, are so charita∣ble
to strangers, that nothing shall be denied them, if
it rest in their powers to relieue their distresse and
wants. In like sort are the people of the East <HI>India,</HI> so
respectiue of strangers, that the State deputeth certain
persons to supplie them with all things requisite: and
in case a stranger chance to die, the merchants of
their countrey shall haue deliuered vnto them their
<PB N="63" REF="42"/>
goods. And verely of al reformed States, ther is none,
I iudge, more humane toward strangers at this day,
than are the Nobilitie of <HI>England,</HI> &amp; of <HI>Polonia.</HI> What
vnciuisitie of manners and policie doth the Pope in
most of his regiments vse, forbidding marriage to
Priests? that which the Ethiopians, vpon the same in∣conuenience
politicke, permitted notwithstanding;
rather hazarding the incōuenience of remisnes &amp; co∣uetousnes,
than the mischiefe of many more horrible
sins. How vnseemly is the custome of the Frenchmen
toward their King, and ancients in nobility &amp; yeers?
Short of that the Arabians attributed to euery ancient
in yeeres. Behold what great respect the Turkes, Tar∣tarians,
and Persians giue to their Princes: in which
point the French come shortest. All men know how
sauage the Italians are toward their wiues by impriso∣ning,
cooping vp, &amp; locking vp al, thorow the heat of
their ielous harts, though themselues are the most Li∣bertines
thorow the world: And yet the Parthian hea∣then
are so courteous, ciuill &amp; kind to their wiues, as
without manifest proofes, they wil not be ouer ielous
or suspicious. From whom I suppose the French haue
learned not a little renowne in that point, not trauai∣ling
to presse down that, which like y<SUP>e</SUP> Palme tree, the
more it increaseth. Be not the Dutchmen most slouē∣ly
and sluttish in their apparell, &amp; feeding? wheras the
Africans detest the same, accounting bodily cleanli∣nesse
and honestie a point of dutie. And though the
Turks and Indians, &amp; other Barbarians of <HI>Africk,</HI> and
the sauage out-lawes of many nations, eat their meat
on the ground, yet are they more neat &amp; cleanly, than
those Dutchmen or our Irish. So the barbarousnesse
<PB N="64" REF="43"/>
which of all other Nations possesseth those Dutch∣men
except the Tartarians or Hell-hounds, which e∣qually
account it an honour to be drunke) to eate, to
drinke, and become more vnciuill than beasts.</P>
<P>It is not reprehended in the Scythians, that cruell
natiō: none daring to drink any wine, but such as the
King shall drinke vnto, and giue vnto; which is com∣monly
to those onely, that in times of watre haue kil∣led
most of their enemies, and shed most blood. For
amongst them none are reputed valiant, but such as
haue caroused the blood of men. Doe not the Egyp∣tians
refraine to eate or drinke more than sufficeth
nature? and that for good cause, seeing superfluitie of
meate breedeth all diseases, and many incurable. The
reparation of which abuse nature teacheth in the
Schoole of brute beastes. Hath not that enemie of
reason of those Dutchmen and Tartars infected the
greater number of our gallants, and those of ciuill
nations, since their conuerse in the Lowe Countreys?
In so much that at ordinary assemblies some striue to
be first and most drunke: others are compelled to the
like, against nature and manners, whereof many bit∣ter
incouueniences haue growen: insomuch as I see
not why it should be a lesse matter for any that com∣pels
another to drinke against his will, and thereby
mscarieth in health, than in forcing any to eate or
drinke poyson. And it is knowen, that vnder the
raigne of heathen Monarchs it was a law, at feasts not
to bee compelled to drinke more than euery man
pleased.</P>
<P>The Italian, although in conuersation hee be not
offensiue, but obedient and humble to his superiour,
<PB N="65" REF="43"/>
to his equall obseruant, to his inferior gentill and cour∣teous,
amiable to strangers and swimming in com∣plements
and louing tearmes, yet the least occasion di∣ssolueth
auncient bonds of loue; so vnsteadie and
inconstant are they in ciuill offices noe lesse important
then the other. As it fareth with those that frequent
our Ordinaries, such as be gamesters, the least crossing
of whom, though great friends and companions other
waies, looseth the simmond of frendship compounded
in many places, and many yeares, at an instant. For,
such would haue the world know, the ciuilitie that is
in them cannot brooke vnciuilitie profered, without
risentiment in the highest nature. And, as in pic∣king
of quarrells so in managing them, I thinke no na∣tion
hath beene so rude in generall: For, whether
cause be proffered or no, or whether it stands men vp∣on
to make iust risentiment and seeke reparation for
iniurie, or indignitie, or whether such be in the right or
wrong, euerie man according to his fancie proceedeth,
or as the stare standes humorous. What Gothishe
barbarousnesse possesseth the Italians, in the pursuite of
their lust? What vnciuilitie and alluringnesse to lust, do
their Curtizans in gesture and apparell vse? And,
though the Tarnassariās (a people in habiting the Cost
of <HI>Bengala</HI>) neuer marrie women, before some white
Christian or Mawhometan haue cropped their Vir∣ginities,
yet afterwardes doe they carrie themselues
so ciuilly that the least inconstancie bringeth death on
such; not vnlike to an olde custome that the No∣bilitie
of <HI>Scotland</HI> vsed in times past to leuie the Vir∣ginitie
of all such Maides as held of their Mannors:
and in case such were married before homage Vir∣gineall
<PB N="66" REF="44"/>
done, to their Lords they were subiect to great
fines. So by the like barbarous custome the chiefe sa∣crificing
Priest of <HI>Calecut,</HI> before the King would mar∣rie
his Ladie, was enioyned to take the Assaie of the
Queene, and trie her Virginitie: for which acte the
king alwayes rewarded him with an hundred Crownes.
Yet wee see how detestable that barbarousnesse is a∣mongst
other heathen people, that death is thought
to good for any Adulterer, or fornicator, or deflowrer
of Virgines. Moreouer, what inconstant luxuriousnesse
and superfluitie of vnciuilitie, in fashions and apparell,
toucheth the French; The which, except of vs Eng∣lish,
is reproued of most Nations in the world.</P>
<P>And amongst many barbarousnesses of manners,
how strange is that of the French mens dissimulati∣on
to their verie friends? The which is left also he∣reditarie
from the Lumbards to the Italians that haue
any education.</P>
<P>I feare me, other Nations trauailing thither will say
that we beginne to smell of that disease. Lastly, what
fencerlike and gladiatorious behauiour bemaddeth the
Germanes? What corruption of manne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s generaly
reigne in the Italians? Insomuch that other lesse accort
Countries then ours haue this cōmon prouerbe, wher∣of
it shall suffice to touch that of the Germanes;
<Q><L>Multi Germani rustici</L>
<L>In Italiam proficiscuntur angeli;</L>
<L>Redeunt diaboli vrbani.</L></Q>
What inconstant countenance, do these Italians sauor
of? What arrogancie and insolencie discouereth the
Spaniard to his superior and equall; what insupporra∣blenesse
<PB N="67" REF="44"/>
to his inferior and subiect? What falsehoods
may men finde in the Gelderlanders? whereas Turkes
being Heathens are keepers of promise. What cruel∣tie
and tyrannie do the Spaniards and Irish discouer to
their enemies? What pride of the French? What per∣tinacitie
generally do Schollers, Courtiers, and Soul∣diers
discouer? What inhospitalitie do the Germanes
keepe? What anger and hastinesse of the Irish? yea of
the poorest kerne.</P>
<P>Thus, by these examples, may a Trauailer suruey
the ciuilitie and barbarousnesse of Nations, in euerie
vertue actiue or morall;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place of Ciuilitie and Barbarousnes.</NOTE> chiefly in the Court and
Citties. For the Countrie people rellish of rudenesse
euermore; though in some points they may serue for
samplers of great ciuilitie, and true carriages, of the
which a trauailer must in particular make obseruance.
But considering, that which is Ciuilitie in one Nati∣on
is vnaccustomed and reiected in other State; it may
be doubted how a Trauailer shall demeane himselfe
to be compleat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Touching the varietie of manners what trauailers are to obserue and follow.</NOTE> and know which to retaine. The an∣swere
is easie: for it is euer presupposed, that it is no
breach of office or of ciuilitie being in another
Nation to obserue the fashions, guises and customes,
of the same, in things indifferent and ceremoniall, al∣though
they grate on barbarisme; as superfluitie of
complements and words, such as the French and Ita∣lians vse,
the manner of eating and drinking, whe∣ther
vppon the ground lying along, as in <HI>Turkie</HI> and
<HI>Africke,</HI> or standing: The manner of saluting with the
hatte on without bending of the knee, without bow∣ing
of the bodie, without imbracing, without profering
of the hand, without conioyning, without kissing
<PB N="67" REF="45"/>
and such like externall customes of indifferencie,
becomming well enough the boundes of euerie Coun∣trie.
For, though it be a rule with vs that those ceremo∣nies,
and ciuill vses come neérest to the point of true
cariage, and consequently most commendable, that ex∣presse
humilitie, and curtesie, and encrease affection of
most kindnesse and humanitie (hence comes our salu∣tations
bareheaded, and hand kissing, bowed bodies and
knees, embracings, conioyning and shaking of the
hand, peculiar to great personages; hence the Italians
and French haue gotten <HI>probatum</HI> of their humilious
phrases and kind complements of kissing their hands;
the Spaniardes of humbly kissing the hands of those
they respect and conuerse with, men as women, the
Dutch in their carrowsing in like sort as we vse, in con∣tracts
by imposition of hands and afterwards by kissing
them) yet we see the nature of the Italians cānot brooke
kissing openly of women, nor the French being long
bareheaded; and in like expressions other Nations are
as precise. Notwithstanding, in the expressions of moral
vertues and vices, a Trauailer must be so curious
and graue, that hee not only beware to committe
sinne and do as the people do, but cleaue wholly to
the vertue and meane of things, abhorring blasphe∣ming,
swearing, rayling, malreporting, and such
like vices of the tongue, as of all other actions and
customes of wickednesse which are euill in their
owne nature, without circumstances. And these
Trauailers haue prerogatiue of other Nations to
prescribe against many though indifferent and against
all euill customes, that swarue from the rule of Nature
&amp; humanitie. Thus hauing long stayed vpon this haunt
<PB N="69" REF="45"/>
of the first discouerer of the nature of people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second dis∣couerer of the peoples nature.</NOTE> the se∣cond
offereth it self, for the Trauailer to know; Whe∣ther
the people be <HI>Free</HI> or <HI>Seruile.</HI> For al people con∣sidered
as Subiects are one of these two.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freedome or seruilenesse politicall.</NOTE> And though
by nature largely cōsidered, one man is equally so free
as another; none more seruile (for seruitude is poli∣ticke)
yet we see some people politickly seruile as free,
some more, some lesse, according to the alteration of
times and things. By the words seruile &amp; free then are
meant, not the naturall (since all by nature are seruile
to sinne and vnrighteousnesse, and are equally free
from miserie and subiection) but the politicall, which
maketh some people free, in regard of misery and ser∣uitude,
and other seruile to slauery, miserie, and sub∣iection.
Now seeing all people of a State are vnder
subiection in generalitie, in this place the nature of a
people must bee sought out of such as are free from
slauery and miserie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freedome frō slauery and misery.</NOTE> and of those that are seruiled vn∣to
them. Of people free in this sense, there be some
by prescription enfranchised,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By prescriptiō.</NOTE> the gouernment of
whose States by good lawes haue made them free
from long miserie or slauery: Such are the Commons
and Nobilitie of this land, whose freedome is such, as
they enioy their owne things so freely as the Prince.
The like may be sayd of the States of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Ger∣manie,</HI>
and of other well ordered Common wealths.
Moreouer, such freedome generally reigneth in
<HI>France,</HI> as with vs here in <HI>Kent,</HI> that what slaue or
bondman shal but land in <HI>France,</HI> is immediatly made
free: and whosoeuer abideth one yeere in <HI>Kent,</HI> shall
be euer after enfranchised. Moreouer, there be others
free by arrogation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By arrogation▪</NOTE> who according to the state of
<PB N="70" REF="46"/>
times and things licentiously vse their libertie. Such
in times past were the people of <HI>Denmarke:</HI> whose
force was their law, in so much that their Prince held
his royaltie at their <HI>placitum.</HI> For, if at any time they
misliked any of his actions he was instantly deposed,
and an other set in his place. Such at this day is the
freedome of the Venetians, that they seeme to beare
a hard hand ouer their Dukes. And such is the com∣mon
nature of euery Democracie and Aristocracie.
Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By policie.</NOTE> there bee some whose policie and state haue
continued them in much freedome from miserie and
slauerie, as euer striuing against seruitude. Such were
the Sclauonians, the Switzers, and the Lumbards,
the Neapolitanes, in the Romane gouernement: in
so much as these people being euer confederates
with that mightie Empire, yet durst they giue suc∣cour
to the banished from <HI>Rome.</HI> Such were the Hun∣garians
against the Turke.</P>
<P>Such generally are the Nobility of most Christian
States, who as Libertines are euer out of tyranny, be∣fore
the Cōmons. Such are the Spaniards that chuse
rather to die than to be made slaues. And such is the
naturall affect of those that either haue enioyed long
freedom, or feele sensibly the hard yoke of bondage.
In a word,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciuilitie the meanes to o∣bedience.</NOTE> such are the people of Ireland, who not be∣ing
accustomed to ciuility and obeisance, spurne so
much against the same: For, the Nobility spurn against
subiection; &amp; the Cōmons folow their Lords &amp; Lea∣ders,
thorow want of ciuility &amp; Christian knowledge
that keepeth euery man <HI>in officio.</HI> The markes of liber∣ty
and freedome of people are riches &amp; ease; both pe∣culiar
to the Grecians and English; the Germanes a∣bound
<PB N="71" REF="46"/>
in ease: the Venetians procure their liberty by
their riches.</P>
<P>These things cōcerning the freenesse of people. The
like in effect be considered of those people which are
seruile; namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seruitude, two fold.</NOTE> whether they be seruiled thorow ty∣ranny
&amp; oppression, or thorow depression &amp; keeping
vnder violently; both sorts being subiects of misery
&amp; calamitie. Of the first sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. By oppressi∣on.</NOTE> we heare of the Tartariās
vnder their <HI>Cam;</HI> for the whole State of all they haue
standeth at his fancie to dispose of: the word of whose
mouth serueth for a sword to reuenge him of rebels,
and yet they reioyce thereat; neither dare any man
say, This is mine, or anothers: neither can any man
dwell other-where than his Lord assigneth him. The
<HI>Liuonians</HI> vnder the Duke of <HI>Muscouie</HI> are so seruile,
that they dare not but call him <HI>Tzar,</HI> or King; where
none other nations doe the same. Moreouer, so ser∣uile
are the Muscouites, that they call themselues the
slaues of the Duke: neither dare they sell anything,
before the Dukes officers haue surueyed the same. A∣like
seruile are the people of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> in so much as
the officers of the Countrey may enter into any mans
house, and take their pleasure of any thing; where no
farmer dare come in the presence of this Lord, without
gifts or bribes. So the Commons of <HI>Sweuia</HI> in times
past were in great misery vpheld by their Princes and
Nobilitie: For, all commodities passed and repassed
thorowe their fingers. Lastly, such are those people,
whose ouer-rulers are Tyrants, as the Turke gene∣rally
thorow his Dominions; the Pope ouer the
Cleargie, and many temporall States. Nowe of
the second sort of Seruile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By depressi∣on,</NOTE> wee find the husbandmen
<PB N="72" REF="47"/>
and tenants of <HI>Italie,</HI> who liue hardly and poorely to
vphold the Gentlemen their Land-lords. So liue the
Boores vnder the Germane Nobilitie, in greater mi∣serie
and subiection, than the poorest person in this
land. Such are moreouer the Commons of a Nation
where either ciuill warres, or omission of good and
holesome lawes reigne. Such of late time were the
Boores of the Low Countries, and Pesants of <HI>France:</HI>
so finally are al those Commons whose Nobility like
<HI>Solons</HI> great flies breake thorow the net of the Lawe,
and where the Prince is remisse in gouernment.</P>
<P>Now the markes of seruile people are hereby ga∣thered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The markes of seruitude.</NOTE>
namely, Pouertie and Want, and excessiue
paines-taking and moyling to gaine their liuing. Such
were the Irish: such are the Moores.</P>
<P>It now remaines to shew what vse a Trauailer shall
make hereby. First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rules of policy touching the same,</NOTE> by these, the loyaltie and vn∣steadinesse
of Subiects are discouered: then their con∣stancie
and reuolting humor vpon occasions profe∣red.
And lastly, who are to be trusted for friends, and
who feared for enemies: These being instruments
for the Politician to plot vpon; and therefore I will be
sparing in the discourse.</P>
<P>The third thing that discouereth the nature of the
people is for our Trauailer to consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third dis∣couerer of the peoples nature</NOTE> whether the
people of a Nation or State bee <HI>Religious,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religiousnesse or Profane∣nesse.</NOTE> or <HI>Pro∣fane.</HI>
These wordes must be restrained; considering
Religiousnesse is properly taken for the godly exer∣cise
of that profession, without Idolatrie or superstiti∣on,
the which is true Religion. All other shewes are
shadowes irreligious, and not substantiall professions.
In like sort may it be said of Profanenesse: which is of
<PB N="73" REF="47"/>
those people who leauing the pathe of mans dutie to∣ward
God wander in the field or wildernesse of error,
either through ignorance, presumption, or imperfectiō.
Wherefore, that our Trauailer may not bee put to
plunge, the words in this place implie a larger vnder∣standing.
For, by religious people is meant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is ment by these words</NOTE> such as are
passing deuoute and zealous in religion, be they Chri∣stian,
Heathen, or Antichistian. So likewise by pro∣phane
people I conceiue Libertines, Atheistes, and po∣liticke
religious people, who oppose themselues against
the superstitious and deuout practise of godlinesse: as
temporizers aud epicureall worldlings. In this first sense
most Nations in the world at this day are &amp; haue been
euer deuoute and religious: some in the truth, as the
true people of Israell, and all such Christian people
as of the certaintie of the Scriptures and worde of
God do serue the Lord as hee commaundeth, reiecting
humane traditions and superstitiousnesse, as prophane∣nesse
politique and damnable. Heereupon rose that
worthie custome of the Nobilitie of <HI>Poland,</HI> whenso∣euer
the Gospell was a reading in their Churches, To
draw out their swords, signifying, that they were readie
to defend the truth thereof, if any durst oppugne the
same.</P>
<P>And hence no doubt at the first sprang our custome
heere in <HI>England,</HI> of standing on our feete and rising
vp, when the Articles of our faith either are a rea∣ding,
or during the reading of the Gospell; thereby
expressing that by this wee will stand and abide against
the world and other like ceremonies, which superstitiō
I feare hath corrupted. Heereupon, are the Saxons
noted to bee verie deuout, but withall opinionatiue.
<PB N="74" REF="48"/>
So are the Bohemians deuout and zealous withall.</P>
<P>Moreouer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious in Idolatrie and superstition.</NOTE> some are religious in idolatrie: as were
the Egyptians, the Assyrians, Philistines, and those vn∣circumcised
people that worshipped strange GODS.
Such are at this day the barbarous people of the East
and West <HI>Indies,</HI> that worship the vgly shapes of Di∣uels,
of the Sunne, Moone, Starres, of the Elements &amp; of
other Creatures. Others there are deuout in superstitiō:
as the Turkes and Persians, who with much deuotion
are trained vp vnder the policie of their Prophets <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>
and <HI>Haly.</HI> Lastly, there are some blinded won∣derfully
in Idolatrie &amp; superstition: such are the Pope∣lings
and those that goe vnder the name of Catho∣lickes,
but abusiuely. The which religious proceeding
is so hatefull to those that follow the <HI>Greeke</HI> Church,
but singularly to the Muscouites, that if any of their
Nation bee but reputed to haue spoken with a La∣tine
or Romane, it behooueth him to bee purged,
before hee shall bee intertained and receiued to par∣take
of the Communion: for they accompt such pol∣luted.</P>
<P>The verie like may a Trauailer consider of the peo∣ple,
which be profane: such as the Epicures and Tem∣porizers
are that florish singularly in <HI>Italie.</HI> And accor∣ding
as it hath beene reported of the Normans in times
past, that they cared little for any of Gods seruice: So,
the Romanes profanenesse, and contempt of vertue e∣uerie
Nation is full of; Like as it hath beene spoken
of the Cicilians, that they regard no man whilest they
themselues are in prosperitie.</P>
<P>Thus a Trauailer may referre vnto his proper head
the nature of the people concerning religiousnesse or
<PB N="75" REF="48"/>
profanenesse, the which may in generalitie and in par∣ticular
stand him in much stead. Moreouer, I suppose
it also very needfull for a Trauailer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A consideratiō.</NOTE> to consider whether
the people Religious or Profane so stand, by the
omission or want of lawes, or by the seueritie of
Lawes or customes. For, though religion cannot be
constrained, yet it may bee restrained by ordinan∣ces,
so as a Trauailer shall hardly discerne it. Hence
wee see the Nobilitie of <HI>France</HI> passing deuoute of
Custome, the Gascoignes religious without super∣stition,
our Commons in times past verie supersti∣tious:
as generally are all that bee newly weaned from
poperie. Thus much as concerning the religiousnesse
or profanenesse of people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth dis∣couerer of the peoples nature. A triple consi∣deration of warlike or effeminatenes.</NOTE> The fourth resteth to be
considered: whether the people of a Nation bee
<HI>Warlike</HI> or <HI>Effeminate:</HI> Whereof let a Trauailer
ground his obseruation vnder these three heads: name∣ly,
whether the people be effeminate or warlike through
naturall complexion. Hence wee diuine all phlegma∣tickes
and sanguinistes effeminate by nature; as all me∣lancholickes
and cholerickes warlike. Secondly, whe∣ther
the people be effeminate for want of good disci∣pline,
as commonly those are where either vices, or
great excesse abound; these being great withdraw∣ers
of mens courages, weakening and poisoning the
powers of soule and body, so as without discipline
such men are vnapt for the warres altogether. Lastly,
whether the people be warlike through the feare of Ty∣rannie,
or by good discipline. For as discipline ma∣keth
some that naturally are cowardes and phlegma∣tickes
good soldiers in time: so want of discipline we see
giues the reignes of exces to breed vices &amp; corruptiō of
<PB N="76" REF="49"/>
hearts, and enfeebling of mindes otherwise of good
temper for the warres: such are the sanguinistes. And
as the excesse of commodities in a land make men idle,
so the barrennesse enforceth others to be industrious,
which is one of the best discouerers of a warlike people.
Hereof it came to passe, that the Sicilians haue been no∣ted
for cowards and effeminate; whereas the inhabitants
of the mountain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and <HI>Alpes,</HI> haue euer carried the
name of hardie &amp; warlike. The like some haue obserued
in the Lowe Countrie people, till discipline and feare of
tyrannie procured them some choler. Wee reade of
the Lithuanians for want of good discipline to be so ef∣feminate
and cowardly, that they neuer goe to the
warres willingly: and oftentimes being prest giue great
summes of money to be released from the seruice. So in
times past (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> reciteth) were the people of <HI>A∣fricke</HI>
so effeminate and faineants that the women did
euerie thing abroad for marchandize and husbandrie:
as it hath been reported of the men of <HI>Holland</HI> that were
wont to carrie their fardels on their heads, whereas the
women did carrie their burdens vnder their Armes.
Yet so warlike were, by the same ground, the Denmarks,
that going to the warres the souldiers would neuer a∣bandon
their leaders, but die in the field rather then flie
so long as their Leaders liued: it being moreouer an in∣famie
reputed for souldiers to die in their beddes, or of
other sickenesses then that which commeth by warres.
Herby also we finde the valiancie of the Switzers accor∣ding
to their discipline: whereas the Arabians and
Asiaticques are tainted with cowardize. The English
likewise are feared of all men for their valiancie, euen
as the Hungarians are reputed hardie and stoute. In so
<PB N="77" REF="49"/>
much that they haue beene branded for grayhoundes &amp;
wolues in regard of other Nations but Hares and Fox∣es;
Whereas the people of little <HI>Britaine</HI> haue been
esteemed timorous, especially where they bee opposed
by the English: in like sort were those of <HI>Picardie.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, do not all men see heere in <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
in <HI>France,</HI> in <HI>Italie, Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Germanie,</HI> that
these things do alter the people from warlikenesse to ef∣feminatenes:
and contrariwise good &amp; long discipline
are meanes to recouer their ancient glorie? whereby a
Trauailer shall not only discouer the present estate of
things, but be able with the politician to diuine into
what chaunces such people may fall.</P>
<P>The fift and last discouerer of the nature now remai∣neth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fift disco∣uerer of the peoples nature,</NOTE>
for a Trauailer to make obseruation, namely: of
what <HI>Condition</HI> of bodie and <HI>Disposition</HI> of minde the
people be of.</P>
<P>As touching the condition of bodie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The peoples condition dis∣cernable in three things.</NOTE> Three
things are to be respected: First, the Stature; whe∣ther
tall, lowe, or of meane size of person, Se∣condly,<MILESTONE N="1"/>
of what complexion: whether faire, browne,<MILESTONE N="2"/>
blacke, tawnie, fatte, leane, slender, or well limmed;
whether deformed or mōstrous in nature, hauing more
or lesse limmes, then the common sort of people and
such like: which for breuitie sake by examples I
passe ouer. Thirdly, whether the people bee long <MILESTONE N="3"/>
or short liued, and whether healthie or sickelie, and
whether great feeders and drinkers, or not: The vses
whereof being common, I passe them ouer. In like
sort for the inclination and disposition of the peo∣ples
mindes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The peoples inclination discouered in foure points.</NOTE> foure things are to be considered. First,
whether the people bee giuen to idlenesse or paines
<PB N="78" REF="50"/>
taking; then, to what occupations and trades they are
accustomed. Thirdly, whether they bee addicted to
letters, or otherwise incurious of learning: Lastly,
what vices and vertues the people are most giuen vnto;
and that whether by defect or administration of lawes,
or by their own temperatures. The least of these are of
moment to be vnderstood. For besides the particular
profit that euerie Trauailer shal reape thereby, there is a
publike and multiplex of stuffe for such (if so they hap∣pily
afterward step to the helm and be called to aide the
motion therof) to worke vpon, either to reforme euils
in their own Common-weale, or to mooue commotion
or pacification twixt forraine Powers and nations.
Which, for that these are the materials of politicians, I
omit to explane how and in what sort. And forasmuch
as the nature of people in this point may be the better
discouered in particular, I propounde foure Censures,
which open the verie affects of the heart, vnto such as
couet to know in particular the secrets of euerie ones
minde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure bewray∣ers of mens affections to vice or vertue.</NOTE> in common actions expressing vertue or vice;
They are the exercises, the diet, the apparel, and the con∣uersation
of men: of which, if we may not offend, we will
consider a little, how &amp; in what manner they may stand
a Trauailer in stead either to establish peace, or to enter∣taine
war, in case of imployment. First then, of exercises
some be honorable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exercises trip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</NOTE> others for pastime and recreation.
Such as follow the honorable, whether warlike or of
learning, discouer good instruments of peace or warre.
For, as by the exercises of warre men shew couragi∣ous
and high mindes, spirited and strong bodies: so
by exercising points of learning and knowledge, ho∣nest
and settled mindes are bewraied; and consequently
<PB N="79" REF="50"/>
meete persons, the one for peace the other for warres.
Those, that exercise for pastime and delight only, are
marked for corrupt, and weake members in a State, ei∣the
for peace or warre: yet rather affecting peace then
warre.</P>
<P>The second Censure is the diet of men. <HI>Diet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diet triple.</NOTE> it is
either of meate, of drinke, or of sleepe. Those that
be Epicures in any of these three, are to be taxed for
the most part for slouthfull, vitious and effeminate
bodies. Those that be temperate in these three, and
accustome their bodies to endure hardnesse, may be ob∣serued
for men of action and employment: and as these
may prooue good instruments for warre, so the other
are scarce good for either.</P>
<P>The apparell reuealeth like affections; which con∣sisteth
either in the fashion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A triple consi∣deration of apparell.</NOTE> or stuffe, or colour. Those
that keepe the fashion which is approued in the Court,
if they be Courtiers, shew discretion and constancie.
Where, on the other side, they bewraie lightnesse and
ficklenesse, vnlesse in speciall cases. So doe all those
that affect vneasie and vnhandsome fashions. Those
moreouer are not euer the wisest that are first in the
newe fashion, but such rather that come in the
taile; if they doe it in this respect, to see first whe∣ther
the same bee better and more necessarie then the
olde. But seeing fewe Nations in the World be va∣riable
in fashions but wee and the French, I will shut
vp this point, that there is a meete fashion for Cour∣tiers,
for souldiers, and for other people, necessarily
distinct. For, the Courtier respecteth comelinesse,
the soldier ease and warmth, the rest are variable; accor∣ding
as they stand in yeares, or humors, or necessitie.
<PB N="80" REF="51"/>
As concerning the state of apparell: Whosoeuer wea∣reth
not good apparel, being a Courtier, and in Court,
beseeming this Estate and being young, discouers his
discontentment or want of meanes: so they that goe
more costly then the guise of the place or their ha∣bilitie
can beare withall, or not respecting times, pla∣ces
and persons, reuealeth vanitie and hautie Ambiti∣on.
The like affections are bewraied by the third, to
weet the Colour; it being for the most part generally
through the world respected for a Concordance ac∣cording
to the fitnesse of yeares, of persons, of times, &amp;
places; the which are circumstances reuealing the af∣fections
or imperfections of men in the colours of their
apparell.</P>
<P>The last Censurer is the <HI>Conuersation</HI> of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conuersation.</NOTE> with
the vertuous or vitious; whereby the secret carriages of
the minde be discouered. For, as those that keepe euill
companie bewray imperfect mindes: so such as con∣uerse
with the vertuous may be obserued for honest and
trustie men to be imployed in the affaires of their com∣mon-wealth,
either for peace or warre, if other things
concurre withall. In which conuersation an eye must
be had of such to discerne, what wisedome, valour,
temperancie, liberalitie, vprightnesse, couragiousnesse
of minde euerie one of the nobler sort in his actions
discouers: and contrariwise of the vices and capitall e∣uils
that reigne in them. But of these wee haue ope∣ned
enough: and also concerning the nature of the peo∣ple:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third point of know∣ledge. The suruay of the Country.</NOTE>
it now remaineth to speake of the thirde point of
knowledge about which a Trauailer must busie him∣selfe,
in the <HI>interim</HI> of his Trauaile: namely, in the
suruey of the Countrie wherein he shall trauaile. But
<PB N="81" REF="51"/>
seeing the consideration hereof is multiplex, it would
be to many very tedious to handle euery species and
subdiuision largely. Wherefore we will but make
a discouerie, &amp; touch onely the most necessary things
to be vnderstood.</P>
<P>Of the Countrey there is a sixefold consideration:<NOTE PLACE="marg">In sixe points principally.</NOTE>
as first of the name, to weet; wherof the Countries or
Cōmon-weales name hath his deriuation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Name.</NOTE> how ma∣ny
sundry names it hath had since the first habitation
thereof; and finally how long it hath continued in
each name, &amp; what were the causes of alteration. The
which things forasmuch as frō records they may be
collected, we wil not insist vpon them: adding only by
way of implicatiō one vse hereof, That such Cōmon-weales
as neuer haue altered their names, will hardly
be subdued, or brought vnder the yoke of an absolute
Conquerer: whereas those that haue been accusto∣med
to change their names, may easily by Conque∣rers
be perswaded to suffer a change. The second
consideration is of the populousnesse or scarcitie of
people;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Populousnes</NOTE> the knowledge whereof is so auaileable, as
a Politician cannot well plot, without good certifi∣cate
thereof from time to time: for a multitude of
people cannot well indure without much trafficke,
without many friends; and in case of penurie, death,
and want, not well without disorder. Neither are a
few people to be feared for great enemies, or to be
trusted for constant friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Situation.</NOTE> and such like. Thirdly, of
the situation of the Countrie, in regard of the earth
and seas, as of the heauens; namely, vnder what Cli∣mate
it lieth, and what signe doth patronize the same.
But these things, being they may be attained vnto by
<PB N="82" REF="52"/>
reading &amp; perusing of Mappes and sea Charts, let it be
sufficient to vs to haue remembred them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antity.</NOTE> Fourthly,
the quantitie (which is either of the length, breadth,
circuit, or figure of the Countrey) is to bee conside∣red.
The which also wee omitte to enlarge by dis∣course,
considering by the rules of Geometrie and
Cosmographie, any may easily attaine to the same.
Onely let this not bee impertinent to be superadded,
how the marches of the countrey (if it be part of the
Continent) is confronted with naturall defence or
artificiall; how it borders on other Countreys, and
what quarter there is kept ordinarily, whereof in
the sixt and last generall point of knowledge, name∣ly,
in the secrets of the State wee shall haue cause to
treate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Commodi∣ties,</NOTE> The fift consideration is to bee made of the
commodities to bee found in the Countrey: And
the sixt likewise of the discommodities. Of these
two last we will dilate a little. First, a Trauailer shall
obserue the commodities of a Countrey, either as
they stand naturally or artificially.</P>
<P>The naturall commodities are foure: namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naturall com∣modities foure</NOTE> the
goodnesse or temperatenesse of the <HI>Ayre,</HI> the <HI>Fruit∣fulnesse</HI>
of the soyle, the plenty of <HI>Riuers</HI> and Ports
(if the same coast the sea): And lastly, the Springs,
Lakes, Baths, Spawes, or Pooles, that haue any
singular vertue in them.</P>
<P>Touching the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Temperate ayre.</NOTE> let not a Trauailer weigh the
goodnesse or temperatenesse of the ayre by his own
constitution of body, that peraduenture can away
well with the same, (as wee see some of our English
bodies can away well enough in colde <HI>Moscouia,</HI> o∣thers
in hot <HI>Morea</HI>) but by the generall well-faring
<PB N="83" REF="52"/>
of the inhabitants without pestiferous diseases and
accidents, that seldome chaunce to that Land and
people, but extraordinarily. For, by the secret
worke of God, there is no Nation so temperate, but
is subiect to corruption of Ayre, when his secret
will shall bee displeased therewith, and that by the
reuolution of the heauens, and of things ingendred
and conteined in them.</P>
<P>Touching the second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Fruitfulnesse of the soyle.</NOTE> which is the Fruitfulnesse of
the soyle, there is a triple consideration; either of
such as mooue and growe vpon the superficies of the
Land (as Vegetables, and liuing sensible things) or of
such things as are hid in the wombe and veines of
the earth, or of the molde it selfe. Touching the
first of these, let Trauailers obserue what store there
is found of irrationall <HI>Animals,</HI> either wilde or do∣mesticke,
seruing for the vse of man; and especially
whether the Countrey doe yeeld a superfluitie; and
whereof. As in generalitie, <HI>Africk</HI> yeeldeth the best
Mules; <HI>Europe</HI> the best Lions, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Pli∣nie</HI>
make report, onely to bee found betweene the
riuers <HI>Nestus</HI> and <HI>Achelous;</HI> the one coasting <HI>Ab∣dera,</HI>
a Citie of <HI>Thrace;</HI> the other, being a flood of
<HI>Epyrus,</HI> separateth <HI>Acarnania</HI> from <HI>Aetolia.</HI> So
in particular, wee finde <HI>England</HI> yeeldeth the greatest
store of good Sheepe and Wooll: <HI>Muscouia</HI> the
best Bees; yeelding Honie and Wake in plentie; and
the best Furres. Moreouer, let a Trauailer obserue
what store of Vegetables, either of Woods, Trees
for fruite, or plants the Countrey yeeldeth. For,
euery Countrey hath his seuerall Commodities, and
singularitie of them, fitted by the prouidence of God:
<PB N="84" REF="53"/>
as we reade of, in <HI>Asia,</HI> singular Cedars and Pine trees:
so wee haue experience, that for Firre trees and ship∣masts,
<HI>Denmarke</HI> and the New found land is notori∣ous;
for Vines, <HI>France;</HI> for Apples and such ordinary
fruit <HI>England;</HI> for Orenges, Limons, Pomegranates
and such like, <HI>Spaine</HI> and other hot Countries; for oyle
and Oliues, <HI>Candia,</HI> &amp;c. As concerning the second,
which is of things hid in the veines and wombe of
the earth (for what shall we need to enlarge the dis∣course
with the huge woods to be found in <HI>Germany</HI>
and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> or with the notorious Vegetables of o∣ther
Nations) namely, the Mines of mettals and
Fossiles whereof there are such sundrie species, as it
may seeme impertinent of vs to be further touched,
considering so soone as they are discouered, they bee
committed to writing. Now the last of those three
is the fruitfulnesse of the molde, yeelding vnto the in∣dustry
of such people as Till and manure the same,
abundance of all things: the which also we wil referre
to the artificiall consideration of the Countries com∣modities.</P>
<P>The third naturall commodities of a countrey are
the plentie of Riuers and Ports:<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Plenty of Riuers,</NOTE> whereof these things
fall to the obseruation of a Trauailer; From whence
they haue their springs &amp; thorowfare if they be riuers
nauigable, whether they be replenished with fish, of
what kindes, and whether potable and commodious
for the vse of man, how these doe accommodate the
Country; and lastly where they haue bridges, foords,
ferries, or may bee waded ouer. But if the Countrey
be maretine, and ioyning to the sea, what, and what
store of fish the coast aboundeth with; how the sea
<PB N="85" REF="53"/>
ebbeth and floweth in euery Port and Creeke, where
there is good riding for shippes or boates; what shal∣lowes,
sands and flattes; and lastly, what good and
dangerous landing; whereof in the secrets and last
part of the Trauailers knowledge we shall haue oc∣casion
to enlarge. But a Trauailer must be so prudent
in searching out these things, that he haue not a ma∣licious
or suspicious eye cast on him; for it is one of
the conuictors of Spies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Springs and Baths.</NOTE> Now the last of the naturall
commodities, as wee haue sayd, are Springs, Baths,
Spawes, Lakes, Pooles, or other things of goodnesse
and medicineable vertue and commoditie: the which
are to be sought out in seuen things, namely, in their
heat, as Baths and Spawes: in their tastes and sauours,
as <HI>Plinie</HI> reporteth of a certaine Lake amongst the
<HI>Troglodites,</HI> which thrise a day and thrise a night, for
a season, was euer bitter and salt, and at other times
sweete. Thirdly, in their colour, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> repor∣teth,
in <HI>Egypt</HI> there was a Poole, the colour of whose
water was vermilion, which being drunke would
make men bewray secrets. Fourthly, in their odour
or smel, as that fountaine in the Citie <HI>Leuca,</HI> of a most
horrible smel, spoken of by <HI>Strabo.</HI> Fiftly, in the mo∣tion,
at what time they are rising: as that fountaine
besides <HI>Haslea</HI> which neuer riseth but early in the mor∣ning,
at high noone, and at the shutting in of the eue∣ning:
And if therein any euill thing bee cast that
may corrupt the same, <HI>Theodorus Zuingerus</HI> mentio∣neth,
that for certaine dayes after it will not rise at all.
Sixtly, in their effects, as that fountaine of <HI>Salmac</HI> in
the countrey of <HI>Caria;</HI> which, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, ma∣keth
men effeminate &amp; lither. That of <HI>Aphrodisium</HI> in
<PB N="86" REF="54"/>
<HI>Pyrrhea,</HI> that causeth barrennesse, as <HI>Plinie</HI> noteth,
and such like. And lastly, what commoditie either of
them yeelde vnto the Countrey, the which chiefly
is to be considered, of those nauigable Lakes that lie
in the heart of the Land.</P>
<P>Hitherto concerning the naturall:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artificial com∣modities▪ two,</NOTE> the Artificiall
commodities now offer themselues; which a Tra∣uailer
shall find chiefly in two things, namely, in <HI>Buil∣dings</HI>
or in Trades &amp; Sciēces Mechanick. And though
the liberall Arts may seeme to bee of the number; yet
properly they are not the commodities of a Land or
State. Because by the word Commodities is meant,
things that may be transported from State to State, &amp;
caried out of one country into another: which the li∣berall
Sciences well cannot saue in bookes: For the
operatiō of the liberal Sciēces seem to be Spiritual or
Mathematical; wheras that of Mechanical arts shew∣eth
to be corporal. But to our point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Buildings triply conside∣red.</NOTE> of <HI>Buildings</HI> there
may be a triple cōsideration: First, what are the most
cōmon buildings &amp; houses of the country wherin the
common people inhabite, and of what stuffe they are
made. For almost euery countrey differ therin. But
whersoeuer great defects are of these, as in <HI>Ireland,
Muscouie</HI> &amp; other places, it is a note of pouerty &amp; bar∣barousnes.
Secondly, what manner of buildings are
those of Towns &amp; Cities, &amp; of the nobler sort of peo∣ple:
for these euermore draw neerest to ciuility, and
be freest from pouerty. Lastly, what is the Archite∣cturie
of Forts, Townes, Sconces, Cittadels, Castles,
Towers, and of places fortified in the land, about the
discouery whereof a trauailer shall finde much vse
of his Mathematickes, learned before trauaile. But
<PB N="87" REF="54"/>
before wee make discouery of places fortified, let it
not bee impertinent to consider seuen points briefly
in Cities or Townes: as first of the Quantities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seuen obserua∣tions in Cities and Townes.</NOTE> Fi∣gures
and Circuits as well of the Cities themselues,
as of their suburbes. Secondly, of their situation and
strength, and how they stand commodated by sea
or land, or discommodated. Thirdly, of the manner
and matter of their buildings. Fourthly, of their pla∣ces
and things of speciall note, as Gates, Fountaines
Bridges, Churches, Streets, Religous houses, palaces
Arsenals, Store houses Market places, Rialtos, publike
Ambulatories, Schooles, Libraries, Colledges, Vni∣uersities,
and such like. Moreouer, of Vniuersities it
must be considered, whether they bee of Physicke,
of the Lawe, or of any other speciall studie and pro∣fession,
or mixt of all liberall Sciences together,
what number of Students, what companies of stran∣gers,
their orders, priuiledges, and such like: lastly,
what famous men in learning flourish in them. Fift∣ly,
the number of the people of the Cities &amp; Townes
are to be learned so neere as may be. Sixtly, the po∣licie
of them is to be regarded: which resteth either in
the Ecclesiasticall, Scholastical, Oeconomical, or po∣liticall
gouernment: whereof the politicall is most
behooueful, and therfore we will insist only vpon the
same; and that in one word to discerne the maner and
disposition of the peoples liuing, whether in idlenesse
and pleasure, as the Nobilitie of this Land, and of
<HI>France,</HI> or in trades and merchandise, as the No∣bility
of the <HI>Venetian</HI> and <HI>Genoa</HI> States. Moreouer,
with whom they vent that which is superfluous in
their Towne, from what other places they ordinarily
<PB N="88" REF="55"/>
bring such things as they want and stand in need of:
and whether they be driuen to carie out their owne
commodities, or are sought vnto by forreine parts;
Let these things suffice, till the gouernement of the
State in generall shall offer it selfe to be handled in the
fift part, to which we do referre Trauailers that make
doubt of any thing considerable in Townes or Cities.
The seuenth and last consideration then of Cities
is of the priuiledges, immunities, liberties, and free∣domes
of them: whether Colonies, Municipials,
Prefectures, Cities confederate, assemblies, and such
like. Now the other part of Artificiall buildings re∣steth
to our Trauailer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the secret of places forti∣fied may bee discouered.</NOTE> namely, of fortifications. Of
which, forasmuch as the true suruey of them is in
many States very daungerous, we haue obserued, for
the better ease and securitie of Trauailers, three safe
wayes to prie into the secrets of them if accesse bee
inhibited: First, to learne what are fortified holdes
within the land, and what front and coast the sea, and
where seated. Moreouer, within the land, whether
they stand vpon riuers, or waters, or were built for o∣ther
purposes than for the warres, and naturall de∣fence
of the land: whereof in most States there haue
been diuerserected, as by the Nobilitie of <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Ireland</HI> for their priuate vses, and for ciuill warres
fortified, &amp; singularly in <HI>France,</HI> where the Noblesses
for their priuate safegard, haue many strong holdes:
as other Nations that a long season haue either fea∣red
enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A consideratiō of the naturall and of the arti∣ficial strengths of fortificati∣ons.</NOTE> or sought freedome from subiection.
Whereof wee haue of late time experience, by the
fortifications of the Lowe Countrey people. The se∣cond
considereth the naturall and artificiall strength
<PB N="89" REF="55"/>
of them: The naturall attribute defence vnto a place
in regard of situation: which may be cōsidered in hils,
rockes, or waters that make the same vnaccessable or
defenceable, wherof we haue a wonderful example in
the Isle of <HI>Sarke</HI> in our Brutish sea, which is by nature
so fortified, as one man may defend the same Isle a∣gainst
the greatest Army that is able to come against
it. Of like defence is in some respect the castle of <HI>Garn∣sey,</HI>
&amp; for a land Army the city of <HI>Venice,</HI> and of <HI>Mexi∣co</HI>
in West <HI>India.</HI> Moreouer, let it be considered, whe∣ther
equally in all places as the aforenamed, or but on
some sides that defence groweth, as that of <HI>Douer,</HI> ca∣stle
to the sea-ward, and towards the towne. Likewise
what other naturall strengths be within, as plenty of
ground to preserue victuall, good springs that cannot
be withdrawen or corrupted, &amp; such like, which natu∣rally
doe fortifie places greatly in times of besiegings.
Now th'artificial strēgths of Forts cōsisteth in y<SUP>e</SUP> Mat∣ter
or Forme and figure, whether without or within.
Touching the matter &amp; substāce of euery particular,
let it be questioned whether they be of old or new e∣rectiō:
for the olde in times past were made of stone,
bricke, or such like hard stuffe, which now in the perfe∣ctiō
of artillery are more easie to be battered thā Forts
of earth, &amp; are foūd more hurtful to the friend within,
&amp; fauorable to the enemy; yet in speciall cases where
Artillery cannot come to batter, are notwithstanding
momentable: the which if it be well considered, sel∣dome
shall men find old fortifications, but they were
euen seated so, as Artillery could not play vpon them.
In like sort are those new fortifications to be conside∣red,
of what matter (for of earth ther is diuers sorts to
<PB N="90" REF="56"/>
make good fortifications) of what greatnes, largenes,
thicknes, depth, and height are the members of them:
as wals, vammures, ramparts, curtins, cauallirs, para∣pets,
counterscarfes, mounts, platforms, trenches, dit∣ches,
&amp;c, and how replenished with water, what slu∣ces,
what Saleis, what <HI>droit</HI> and oblique passages are
to the same: the which, discreet questioning, &amp; good
indgement of the eye, shall enforme a Trauailer of.
Touching the formes and figures of Forts, that is ei∣ther
regular or irregular. The regular be either <HI>Ro∣tunds,
Quadrats, Pentagonons, Hexagonons,</HI> &amp;c. accor∣ding
to the quantity of the Fort, euery part answering
in correspondencie. The irregular retain those formes
which most naturally may helpe the weaknes of the
place, yet answerable one to another, according to the
rules of fortifications: wherof we had a notable piece
of work for example, in that in <HI>Ostend</HI> in <HI>Flanders.</HI> And
for better iudgement herein, let it not be grieuous to
any Trauailer, if so he happen into the warres, to ob∣serue
the notable means is taken in the field by good
Souldiers for the fortifying of their Campes daily af∣ter
this irregular distribution. Now the last of these 3,
that prie into the fortifications of Countries, is to vn∣derstād
what Captains &amp; souldiers ordinarily belong
to them; their munitions, their paies, &amp; finally their
ordinances &amp; priuiledges. Let these things suffice for
the first of the artifical commodities of the Country.</P>
<P>The second is that of Trades,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2, Trades, Me∣chanick scien∣ces sixe,</NOTE> and Mechanical Sci∣ences;
the which are fashioners and finishers of han∣dicraft
works made through mans inuention, &amp; are in
number sixe, for a Trauailer to consider of; thorow
which al commodities passe and repasse, namely, <HI>Hus∣bandry,
<PB N="91" REF="56"/>
Clothing, Masonry, Carpentry, Smithery, &amp; En∣gining:</HI>
these are generall heads, whereunto all other
trades of necessary obseruation may be referred, that
accommodate a Land. Let vs take <HI>Husbandry</HI> for an
example, vnder which is comprised the sciences of
gardening, of planting and grafting, of manuring, of
grasing, of breeding and cherishing of Vegetables,
Plants, beasts, and such like fostering sciences, for the
nourishment of the creatures, but singularly of man:
Vpon which also other infinite trades depend, wherof
we will omit to speake.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Husbandry dis∣cou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red in three points.</NOTE> But to our point in hand; a
Trauailer shal discerne the husbandry of each coun∣trey
in three points: first, by obseruing what corne
and graine the countrey yeeldeth generally, and that
with what paines and meanes the land is tilled and
manured, what vsuall increase the land yeeldeth, and
such like: whereof there is such difference as is almost
incredible, yea, between setting and sowing. Second∣ly,
what cattell are vsually bred there for the state
aswell of the Land as of other Countries. As in <HI>Mus∣couie</HI>
and <HI>Poland,</HI> Bees; in the Lowe Countries, Kine;
in <HI>England,</HI> Sheepe, and such like. Lastly, what fruits
the countrie yeeldeth: as Grapes, Wine, Oile, Apples,
Peares, Plummes, Orenges, Limons, Nuts, and such
like: and lastly, with what fuell the Land most a∣boundeth.</P>
<P>Touching the second Mechanicall trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clothing.</NOTE> namely,
<HI>Clothing,</HI> a Trauailer must note what speciall stuffe
that Countrey yeeldeth for the same: whether of Le∣ther,
Furres, beasts skins, haire, flaxe, wooll, barks of
trees, bombasie, silke, gold, siluer, or such like: and also
how the same is imployed, for garmēts or otherwise.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="57"/>
So the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Masonrie.</NOTE> which is <HI>Masonry,</HI> requireth the know∣ledge
of such as are workers of stone, brick, or morter
&amp; their artificiall compositions and symmetries. The
fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carpentrie.</NOTE> which is <HI>Carpentrie</HI> is displayed in wood Car∣uers,
Ioyners, Carpenters, or builders of houses, ship∣wrights,
and in all other dependances. The fift, to wit,
<HI>Smitherie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Smitherie.</NOTE> is as variable as any of the former to bee
sought into: whether for varietie of metals to bee
wrought vpon, as Gold and Siluer-smithes, Copper∣smiths,
Brasiers, Tinkers, Pewterers, Founders, blacke
and white smithes, &amp; all such like: or for infinite kind
of tooles and Vtensils, for the necessaries of man, the
which are more excellent in some places than other,
euen by so much as the matter and the Arts-men
tend to perfection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Engining.</NOTE> The sixt and last is <HI>Engining,</HI> which
being an extract from the grounds of Mathematicall
knowledge, is also much the more to bee considered
well of Trauailers, in how much there may arise ma∣ny
singular commodities to ones Countrey, both in
times of peace &amp; warre. Wherin let Trauailers make
obseruatiō who be the most famous workers, &amp; what
admirable things they worke &amp; bring to passe, either
by conueyance of water by scrues, by pullies, by
weights, by causing vacuums or reinforcing of spirits
together in narrowe straights and Cylinders, and
by such other draughts of nature, kept secret from
the vulgar sort: the which in the warres are so neces∣sary,
as in the citie for ciuill and necessarie vses. In∣somuch
as if any man trauailing shal grow therby ex∣cellent,
he is worthy the name of honor &amp; estimation,
though in other points he be found a weake obseruer.
This thing being of such singular proofe and vse
<PB N="93" REF="57"/>
euerie where, may seeme to priuiledge Trauailers a∣boue
any one point of knowledge besides. About the
consideration of which although wee could not dwell
too long (for of it selfe it requireth a volume) yet other
manifould points vntouched doe craue our discourse
now.</P>
<P>Only for discouerie let this be added, that whatsoe∣uer
by naturall conclusions and (as wee say) by sleight,
with small adoe effecteth great things (as to moue bo∣dies
contrarie to nature violently, and swiftly; to make
powerfull any weake thing, and to discouer things vnto
the senses afar off out of their kēning, or to penetrate any
thing resistable) may be contained vnder the arte or sci∣ence
of Engining. Hitherto concerning the com∣modities
of the Countrie:</P>
<P>The <HI>Discommodities</HI> now may easily be <HI>ex opposito</HI>
collected from the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6. Discommo∣dities.</NOTE> to enlighten the sixt and last
point, concerning the Countrie. Notwithstanding,
we wil for better vnderstanding to some as it were make
repetition. The discommodities then of Countries are
either imperfectious, or wants. The imperfections na∣turall,
are either intemperatenesse and vnholesome aire
or extream barennesse of the Soile yeelding little or no
commodities, or aboundance of cruel beastes: of which
our Trauailer must haue a care, to vnderstand whether
the same be not for want of good husbandrie in the
people of the Countrie. The artificiall discommodi∣ties
are likewise two, Buildings, and trades. The defect
of the one hindereth a Countrie from well peopling, of
the other from well and orderly liuing. For it is a <HI>maxi∣me</HI>
in policie, that no Countrie can be euer ciuile and
orderly where there be not good trades planted for set∣ting
<PB N="94" REF="58"/>
the Commons to worke, for the husbanding all
such commodities as their Countrie yeelds, and of
such as are brought vnto the same frō forrain parts: the
which to a Countrie much peopled is most needfull al∣so.
Thus much concerning imperfections. The
wants are of those things properly, that other Coun∣tries
abound with: which necessarily ciuill Estates doe
want daiely, &amp; must expect them from other places to
furnish them. For though there bee many Ilands
in the World, that content themselues and liue with∣out
the commodities of other places; neither haue
they other then a certaine naturall kinde of prouision,
distributed well and orderly alike to all Nations for
the naturall support thereof: Yet being once brought
vnto ciuilitie, and to the taste of the World, either
to be equall with others, or to be engreatned; there is
no Natiō or Countrie, but standeth in necessarie neede
and want of forraine things: the which being once ta∣sted
of generally, it is almost impossible to be left and
forgotten. The conclusion then of this point, for our
Trauailer may be, That he obserue what speciall thing
the Countrie standeth in neede of, the which is either
of clothing or of victuall: For, these two a Nation that is
ciuile and well ordered cannot long want. As concer∣ning
clothing let it be sufficient which we haue touched
alreadie, in the Commodities: for out of the same may
be gathered the discommodities <HI>è conuerso.</HI> In like sort
may it be saide forvictuals: Only let a Trauailer make
obseruation what liuing Creatures hee shall finde that
cannot liue or bee found in the Countrie: As our <HI>The∣odore
Zuingerus</HI> reporteth of <HI>Africk</HI> that neuer Hart
or wilde Boare was found there. And <HI>Plinie</HI> mentio∣neth
<PB N="95" REF="58"/>
that in <HI>Arabia</HI> no Swine liueth. So in the Ilands
of <HI>Nea</HI> there are bred no Patridges, nor being thither
brought will liue. So some report of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that in it
liueth no venemous beast; for the Climate worketh all
vpon the people; a strange Constellation, for want of
of good Religion.</P>
<P>Let these things suffice touching the 3 generall points
of knowledge respecting the Countrie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth point of know∣ledge.</NOTE> The fourth
now offereth it selfe to our consideration: which is of
the <HI>Lawes</HI> and <HI>Customes</HI> that be vsed in the Countrey:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning Lawes.</NOTE>
the knowledge whereof may well reforme the weedy
affections of Trauailers, and redresse distemperatures
growen in their Countrie, and lastly, open the doore of
many policies, into which a Politician wil soone enter.
But first concerning the word Law, in the intendiment
there is a double respect to be had thereof. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawes diuine and humane.</NOTE> all ho∣nest
lawes haue their deriuation and spring-head from
the eternall fountaine of reason of the will of God: in
which respect they in substance are all diuine. Notwith∣standing
in regard of the diuersitie of people, as of
sundrie causes for which they haue beene reuealed and
promulgated, they are also humane and multiplex.
Wherefore, in the first respect, the <HI>Lawe</HI> is an ope∣ning
of the Diuine and eternall will, whereby GOD
teacheth and commaundeth what shall bee done and
left vndone, of men, ordained for his owne glorie,
chiefly then for the publike &amp; priuate vse of men. Now,
since the reuelation of that diuine will of God hath
not beene manifested in one and the same manner al∣waies
to all people, therefore in this respect the lawe
is distributed into three kinds properly: Into the <HI>Law
of GOD,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law is triple.</NOTE> into the <HI>Law of NATVRE,</HI> and into the
<PB N="96" REF="59"/>
<HI>Humane</HI> or <HI>Lawe of Men.</HI> Touching the law of God,
wee obserue the same either written or not written.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. The law of God.</NOTE> The
not written the learned call that which before the fall,
and afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> was exercised till the Law by <HI>Moses</HI> was
deliuered to the people of <HI>Israell</HI> inscribed in Tables
of stone, and since of Christ himselfe, the Prophets, &amp;
Apostles, enlarged, expounded, confirmed, &amp; set forth:
the which was either Morall and perpetuall, or Iudicial
and politicall. But as concerning the written Law, cō∣mitted
wholly to the Israelites, lette it bee obserued
first that there were Lawes Morall contained vnder the
Decalogue or ten Commandements, perpetuall to all
people and Nations: though for a season the Gen∣tiles
were gouerned by another consenting Law there∣with,
namely, the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature.</HI> Secondly, that there
were Lawes Politicall and Iudiciall peculiar to the
Common-weale of <HI>Israell;</HI> and lastly Lawes Ceremo∣niall,
which being meerely politicall also were tempo∣rall
and to be abrogated by the perfecter, namely, by
Christ by whom all the Ceremoniall and infantiue
Lawes were disannuled and vtterly cancelled. Moreo∣uer
it may not be forgotten, that vnder that vnwritten
Law of God is contained the Law of the spirit and of
life, which is peculiar to the Church of Christ, that
quickeneth the vnsanctified and weake Law of Nature
inscribed in the hearts of men, imprinting the will of
God in their hearts: whereby men by many degrees
steppe forwarde in the true knowledge of God &amp; ser∣uing
of him, at an instant as it were, through the effica∣cie
thereof, more then euer by the Law of nature they
are able to do. These things thus briefly exposed vnto
Trauailers, let it not seeme tedious to any to consider
<PB N="97" REF="59"/>
well thereof. For without an exact knowledge of the
Law of God, there can be no sound iudgement of the
rest. And as our Sauiour Christ soundly reproued <HI>Ni∣codemus</HI>
the Pharisie, for that he was a iudge in <HI>Israel</HI>
and knewe not things of such excellencie and of so
great importance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> so might a Trauailer bee censured
for a shallow and ignorant person, that trauiling into
the lawes of Nations and peoples, is neuerthelesse to be
found ignorant in the Lawes of God, &amp; of their deriua∣tions,
which properly be the fountaines of all natu∣rall
and humane lawes that be good &amp; honest through
the world.</P>
<P>But touching the Law of <HI>Nature,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. The Law of Nature.</NOTE> there is some
controuersie amongst the learned. For the Lawyers
define the Law of Nature to be that which teacheth
all Animall liuing things. But the Scholist Diuines
say the law of Nature, that to be, which is common
to all people, and that by instinct not by constitution,
restraining the same only to men. Wherefore, to
make the same more euident, by fauourable interpreta∣tion
of both, wee distribute the Lawe of Nature into
Common and Proper. The <HI>Common</HI> is that which
equally is common to other liuing Creatures aswell as
vnto men, that is to say, to defend themselues against
violēce, to preserue and maintain their liues and States,
to propagate, procreate, nourish &amp; instruct their owne,
to eate, drinke, sleepe, rest, mooue and such like things,
euerie species according to his being and kinde. The
<HI>Proper</HI> is that lawe which is only peculiar vnto men, be∣ing
the will of God and diuine reason inscribed im∣mediately
by God in the hearts of all men; wherby ge∣nerally
they know what is good and euill, and conse∣quently
<PB N="98" REF="60"/>
what is to be followed and auoyded: the law
of conscience, by which the heathen and such as haue
not the law of God written shall be iudged. The effect
of which law is displaied in the knowledge of God and
in the worshippe of him; and also in the conserua∣tion
of mutuall loue and societie betwixt mankinde:
From which not only the law of Nations hath a name
of substance, but the humane and positiue lawes their
descent and speciall deriuation, as from the spring of
right and reason.</P>
<P>Moreouer, this law is not equally or so effectually
planted in the hearts of all men alike, but in some more
plentifully then in others, according to the secret and
wonderfull dispensation of the good pleasure of God
in the gouernement of the world: From whence there
ariseth such strange worshipping of God amongst the
Heathen, almost euerie Nation in a variable sorte.
Thus wee may see furthermore, that the law of Na∣ture
and of Nations strictly and in the proper sense
taken may well bee confounded, for one and the
same, concerning actions: though after the common
sense they are distinguishable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawe of Na∣tions.</NOTE> For, the law of Nations
is a certaine right and equall reason that naturally
bursteth out of men and Nations, for the necessarie
vse and conseruation of mankinde and for societie;
the which is also perpetuall, and arguing the con∣science,
if it dissent from the same. From whence
the Lawes of Armes concerning prisoners taken in
the warres; the entertainement of messengers and
forraine Ambassadors, as all manner of contractes
twixt person and person, State and State, haue their
authoritie and reason, and doe in speciall manner
<PB N="99" REF="60"/>
giue a name to the law of Nations, to the lawe of Na∣ture:
which offereth to our Trauailer these three cō∣siderations.
First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A consideratiō of moment.</NOTE> that in the Courts of Princes as o∣therwhere
hee obserue, what order and manner of
entertainement and respect is giuen to Ambassadors,
and Messengers of forraine States. Secondly, if such
an one chance to arriue in the warres of other Princes
and States, to note the carriage of one aduersarie to an∣other
in matters of right, and of Prisoners and Cap∣tiues
especially as of Combattes, In a word to get their
discipline.</P>
<P>Lastly, to note amongst heathen people, what
order in buying, and selling, exchanging, lending,
borrowing, mortgaging, pawning and keeping of so∣cietie.
For, happily from thence hee shall descrie
a more equall carriage and behauiour in them by the
law of Nature only guided, then many of our Ciuile
States do by all their meanes of knowledge in the laws
of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sed hoc non defectu legis, sed sensus.</NOTE> of Nature, and of men: the which we might
easily prooue. But to our Point now concerning the
<HI>Lawes Humane.</HI></P>
<P>Those are called the <HI>Lawes Humane,</HI> which frō the ca∣pacities
of men are conceited &amp; by men are promulga∣ted
and authorised: whether they depend vppon the
Law of God and of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. The law Hu∣maine.</NOTE> or vpon their owne fancies:
Wherof, there are two rankes, Honest and Iust, or Ty∣rannicall
and vniust. The honest and iust do flow frō the
general springs and <HI>Maximes</HI> of the diuine and naturall
law ordained for the publike good of the Church and
Cōmō-weale; Wheras the Tyrānical &amp; vniust, issue out
either of the vsurping breasts of vnlawfull authoritie
that haue no power to make lawes: or from such as
<PB N="100" REF="61"/>
hauing power do after their own carnall mindes, make
ordinances for their owne proper commoditie and be∣hoofe:
whereunto the traditions of men, yea and euery
superstitious ordinance and euill custome may be re∣ferred.
Wherefore whensoeuer a Trauailer shall looke
into the body of the lawes of any Countrie or people,
let his iudgement be neither partiall nor weake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> but
grounded vpon the sound rules and eternall reason of
the <HI>diuine</HI> and <HI>Naturall</HI> Law. Moreouer by the word
<HI>Lawes humane,</HI> is meant in this place the writ∣ten
positiue and politicall Lawes: For in substance they
are all one and conuertible, yea and for the profitte
of each Nation commutable, so as they neuer contra∣rie
the lawes diuine or naturall. By reason whereof
we finde that some honest lawes in qualitie differ, ei∣ther
in punishing, or rewarding, or in inciting to that
which is good, or restraining from that which is euill:
the which is meerely a politicall promulgation conso∣nant
to some States for a season, and verie needefull in
speciall cases.</P>
<P>Neuerthelesse there bee many verie pertinax
in this opinion, that Though a State shall inflict
for good causes a greater punishment on malefactors
for such and such crimes, then the lawes of God or of
Nature doo, yet they are ignorāt by what warrāt of like
policie, any State may abbridge the rigor of the law of
God in capitall offenses. For such lawes say they are
both iudiciall and eternal, by which policie no doubt
States may bee best gouerned: for proofe whereof the
abbridgers (say they) of such laws are, by the heathē peo∣ple
that haue not the written law of God, conuinced &amp;
taught how to rule in like cases.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="61"/>
Of humane and positiue lawes there is a variable
consideration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawes positiue variable.</NOTE> according to the vse and titles that euery
Countrie and State holdeth peculiarly almost. As ge∣nerally
heere in <HI>England</HI> wee tearme our law by the
name of Common law, it being a peculiar law to this
State and members. So the Romans in times past cal∣led
their law the Ciuile law. Though indeed all good
lawes (as <HI>Iustinian</HI> himselfe confesseth) may wel en∣ough
be tearmed Ciuile lawes; yet for distinction sake,
let it bee taken heere whensoeuer wee shal name Ci∣uile
lawes, for those that were refined by the Emperor
<HI>Iustinian,</HI> and set foorth by him: the which at this day
are vsed in most of the ciuile States and Nations of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
either in part or altogether. From whence let Tra∣uailers
make this obseruation, Whether the lawes of
the Countrie wherein they trauaile, be lawes preroga∣tiue
or positiue. For there are some Countries gouer∣ned
by lawes meerely prerogatiue:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawes prerogatiue.</NOTE> of which wee
will first expound, to such as intende for to tra∣uaile.</P>
<P>These kinde of Lawes be for the most part vnwrit∣ten;
and therefore require the more care to be searched
out and into, for their vncertaintie. Moreouer, let Tra∣uailers
obserue how farre the prerogatiue of Princes
and States doth stretch ouer their Subiects. For, there
are some so absolute and sole tyrannous, that all things
are gouerned according to the will of the Prince: and
euerie commoditie of the Countrie stands at the Prin∣ces
pleasure. Such is the Tartarian and great <HI>Cam.</HI> O∣thers
there are halfe tyrannous, whose displeasure
and will hath no law to curbe the vnrulinesse there∣of:
such is the Turke, the Muscouian, and the Pope.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="62"/>
Others there are, according as they are, religious and
fearers of the true God, and Princes of ciuile and reli∣gious
States, whose prerogatiue is much, but yet in ci∣uile
and honest actions: being free themselues from pu∣nishment
of their lawes in some sorte; and may from
time to time dispense with and chaunge their lawes,
constituting new as is expedient for the good of the
Common-weale.</P>
<P>Neuerthelesse, some there are that haue, of these also,
greater prerogatiue then others, according to their go∣uernment
and state of policie. For better discouerie, the
law prerogatiue is to be searched either in the person of
the Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to discern lawes preroga∣tiue▪</NOTE> or in the Magistracie which hath his power
from the Prince on State. The Prince (or State if it bee
an Aristocracie) hath absolute power, &amp; not controul∣able,
to command anything, action, or person, whatso∣euer
carrieth semblance of good to the State, or that
cōtrarieth not the law of God &amp; of Nature. Moreouer,
to forbid &amp; controule anything, persō, or actiō what∣soeuer
of like nature, whether by word of mouth, whe∣ther
by letters, proclamatiōs, edictes or such like means
as Princes or States vse. And lastly by cōmission to au∣thorize
other to reward and punish, according to the
offence done, euerie fault that is not encountred by the
Law positiue alreadie; perseruing the life, members,
and speciall liuelyhood of the delinquents.</P>
<P>The prerogatiue of the Magistracie may be discer∣ned
as in our Countrie, in the high Court of Parli∣ament,
in the authoritie of the Councell, in that of
the Starre Chamber, in the Lord Chancellor, Lorde
Treasurer, Lord high Counstable, Lord Mareschall,
Lord Admirall▪ in the principal Secretarie, in the chiefe
<PB N="103" REF="62"/>
Iustices and iudges of the Land, in each Maior and
Towne Corporate, and lastly in euerie high Commissi∣oner
and speciall Officer that the Prince of this Land
deputeth to vndergoe any charge at home or abroad.
So is it in all other States and Countries. The which
being cōsidered by Trauailers, they shal be able to dis∣cerne
the authoritie royall of the Prince and State, as
well in Politicall as in Ecclesiasticall giuing &amp; making
of Lawes. Touching the lawes Positiue, they bee either
Political or Ecclesiastical.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawes positiue Politicall.</NOTE> The Political are either anci∣ent
&amp; Maximes of perpetuall obseruāce, or Modern &amp;
mutable. The ancient are such as the Romanes called
the Ciuile lawes in speciall; such as the French their
law Salique, &amp; such as we the Common law. The Mo∣derne
are all those lawes which goe vnder the name of
Statutes, Decrees, Ordinances, Edicts and such like, be∣ing
in all Ciuile States put into print: the which are by
so much the easier to bee attained vnto by Trauailers,
wherin they may at leasure discouer euerie thing as in a
glasse, either cōcerning the nature of the people, or the
State of the Countrie, The Politicall lawes are change∣able,
according to the standing of things; that the
State may grow to perfection. The Ecclesiasticall
are tradicions lawfull or vnlawfull.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiasticall,</NOTE> The vnlawfull
bee such as are contrarie to the lawe of God, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in no sort tend vnto edification: of which crue
a Trauailer shall meete, within most States. But let him
bee carefull to collect the best wheresoeuer: the
which hee shall discerne by their coates; namely▪ if
they crosse not Gods word or destroy not more then
they edifie. The lawfull tradicions be rules or Ca∣nons
of doctrine, of manners, of rites and Ceremonies
<PB N="104" REF="63"/>
pertaining to godlines, that consent with the holy word
of God and tend to edification. Touching the rules of
doctrin, the Apostles inspired with the holy Ghost haue
left many: the generall and prouinciall Synodes of
godly and honest minded men haue set foorth others,
the which are for the vnderstanding of the holy Scrip∣tures
verie profitable. And lastly, euerie lawfull State
and Church hath absolute power, without the consent
of the Pope or any other forraine approbation, to doe
the like; gathering euermore their constitutions &amp; rules
form the word of God. Touching those of manners
and of Ceremonies, euerie lawfull State and Church
hath absolute power to decree that which shall be most
agreeable with the nature of the State: yet so as all those
Constitutions tend to edification, and bee so neerely
drawen from the holy Scriptures and the best discipline
of other Churches, as neere may be. These bee the
exacte rules for to make discouerie; wherby three com∣modities
shall redound to Trauailers. First, they shall
be able to iudge whether the Countries leane by their
lawes to this or that religion: Secondly, whether the
people be nourished in the right or wrong: and lastly,
they may gather thereby the most sincere and vpright
orders for the perfecting of their owne Countrie and
informing themselues. For when such are well seene
into the lawes of other Countries and expert in those
of their owne Nation, they haue well purchased a good∣ly
Mannor and trench of Land to build policies vpon.
Moreouer, it is verie expedient for Trauailers to marke
not only how many distinct kinds of Lawes the Coun∣trie
vseth to gouerne their people by; but in speciall,
what are ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ll, what particular lawes pertaining to
<PB N="105" REF="63"/>
seuerall diuisions of the Countrey, as those of shires
and Seigniories of townes, places and persons, &amp;c.
And lastly, if, in regard of the time of trauailing, such
be able to take degrees for the approbation of their
knowledge in the Vniuersities, no doubt the honour
and the commodity wil be very great. For, the title of
a degree so atchieued, wil celebrate more their worth
than any other meanes, by getting credite to their
learning and iudgement, and making them capable
of preferment, hauing authoritie to be imployed in
the seruice of the Common-weale. Thus much con∣cerning
the lawes: the which a Trauailer may referre
vnto three heads, if he please; To Things, to Persons,
to Actions. The Customes now follow.</P>
<P><HI>Customes,</HI> they are certaine vses of the Prince, State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customes.</NOTE>
or people of the countrie, vnwrittē for the most part,
that doe prescribe, or stand in force as lawes, chiefly
if they bee good and profitable for the Common∣weale;
whereof there are three <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nkes, that Trauailers
must consider them in: Generall, Particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Generall Particular, Regal.</NOTE> and Re∣gall.
By the Generall Customes are meant the anci∣ent vse
and ordering of all things according to the an∣cient
nature thereof. Of which let Trauailers first
note their alterations. These may be discerned in the
giuing of Lawes: in ensample whereof, wee haue, at
this day, a more exact and ful order of the three states,
concerning forme, than in former times. Secondly,
in the Princes priuate State and houshold: Lastly, in
Religion, in diet, in apparell, and in the externall or∣der
of things and persons. In all which Customes,
most Common-weales differ. Whereof we will en∣sample
onely, to our Trauailer, the Princes priuate
<PB N="106" REF="64"/>
estate and houshold which we cal the Court. Where∣in
what ordinary attendants and dependants, and
what ceremonies, orders, and customes are appertai∣ning
to the person of the Prince, or to the place it selfe
wheresoeuer the Court shalbe, or to the Nobility, are
the rather to be learned of Trauailers, that they may
not be ignorāt of the proper cariage of euery Court,
to enforme themselues of behauiour. In <HI>Tartarie</HI> this
custome is vsed, that no stranger of what quality or
degree soeuer, dare put himselfe in the Kings pre∣sence,
to negotiate with him, before hee hath beene
purged with their fire. Neither is it permitted to any
stranger, to set his foote on the threshold of the
<HI>Cams</HI> lodging, or where any of his Princes or Lieu∣tenants
dwell, on paine of death. And in our ciuill
States we see, no forreiner dare present himselfe to
the presence of the Prince, but by permission, or in
speciall cases, and at special times. Hence moreouer
ariseth our great respect to our Princes, in honou∣ring
and saluting them; whereas the French are little
vncouered, and nothing so respectiue. Some coun∣trey
people do kneele in the presence of their Prince,
others gaze in their faces onely: others cast downe
their heads and lookes; and some (as the inhabitants
of <HI>Baccalaos,</HI> or of the new Land fish) haue a custome
when they reuerence their King, in his presence to
rub their noses, and stroking their forehead with their
hand vnto the necke; the which the King accepteth
as an honest and due office and seruice, turning his
head eftsoones, to his left shoulder, which is a note of
singular fauour, and gratefulnesse of the King to ho∣nour
his Subiect. The which customes, or the like,
<PB N="107" REF="64"/>
though they be strange and not regular, yet doe
they become well enough the bounds of euery nati∣on.
In like sort, the customary phrase of writing and
speaking, of action, of body, of reuerencing, and such
such like, are so to be pondered of Trauailers that they
introduce not them into their owne Country, vnlesse
those customes be of a more ciuill carriage, then such
as their Countrey vseth. For, that is a fowle and ir∣regular
tricke of common Trauailers, to innouate
new fangles of fashions in their Countrey, when they
returne, though they iudge thē to be of better esteem.
This is a common staine, and delight of Ilands. But as
it is a shame for ciuill States to be variable in the cu∣stome
of diuersitie of fashions, wondring at the
customes of other lesse ciuill graces and behauiours,
so as needes those must bee put in practise by them;
so a Trauailer that innouateth forreine peculiar cu∣stoms
of other Courts in his Countrey, where either
more ciuill, or as good are vsed, swarueth from the
guise of completenesse in Trauailers requirable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Particular Customes</HI> concerne the members
of the State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particular Cu∣stoms.</NOTE> as Countreys, Dukedomes, Principali∣ties,
Counties, Seigniories, Domaines, Cities, Towns,
Corporations, Castles, Cittadels, Fortes, and such
like: which require also in regard of their excel∣lencie
to bee looked into, so farre foorth as by dis∣course
and discreete wayes may bee of Trauailers
followed after. The third and last Customes are
<HI>Regall,</HI> which properly are the maiesticke preroga∣tiue
of the Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regall</NOTE> of the Prince, and Nobilitie, as∣well
within their precinct as in and vnder the iu∣risdiction
of another power. Whereof first let it
<PB N="108" REF="65"/>
bee regarded, what preeminence the Countrey
claimes to haue, in and ouer other Countreys not tri∣butary
or subiect to the same. Secondly, as concer∣ning
the Prince, let it be noted what titles, of Custome,
he is inuested with: as the French King to be the most
Christian King, which in those dayes was well arro∣gated
from other nations: As the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> to
bee called, the most Catholike King; which title in
those dayes was proper to him (I speake as a Romist)
for he was <HI>Maximus bellator &amp; professor Romanae Ca∣tholicae
ecclesiae:</HI> And as our Souereigne King of <HI>Great
Britaine,</HI> by like custome now, and with better title,
may most rightfully challenge to be the greatest and
sincerest Defender of the faith of Christ thorow the
world; euen so was it a title in those dayes when it
was reassumed and acknowledged of his Ancestor of
proper attribution (though the Pope had another slie
and slouenly meaning and fetch of policie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quia scripsit contra Lutherū.</NOTE> in the be∣quest).
For, within a little after, that most vndanted
King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight (whom for perpetuall honor
sake I thought good to name) by the good pleasure of
God, became the onely stout Defender of the faith of
Christ singularly, in shaking off the Popes suprema∣cie,
and withstanding his displeasure. Whereunto al∣so
let a Trauailer learne, what place, of Custome, the
Prince hath amongst other Princes: and how farre
the souereigntie of Princes stretcheth, and of States.
The which souereignty is discernable in foure points:
The first is to haue power absolute to giue lawes to al
in generall and in particular, without controlment; as
Priuiledges, Liberties, Franchisedomes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The foure markes of So∣uereigntie.</NOTE> Honors, and
such like regalities to places or persons. The second
<PB N="109" REF="65"/>
note of Souereigntie is to decree warre or peace, or
to enter into treaties concerning them. The third is
to institute and ordaine principal officers. The fourth
is to haue the last Appeale, which is one of the true
markes of Souereigntie, vnder which dependeth the
power to grant pardon to the condemned by course
of law in fauour to redresse the rigor of the lawe, and
formall proceedings of Magistrates, whether concer∣ning
life, goods, honor, banishment or libertie. In
all which, Trauailers shal find in most States great de∣fect;
in fewe, all absolutely. For concerning the first,
what honourable Prince (not naming the Pope, the
Turke, the Tartarian, and such like tyrants) of himself,
without associates, decreeth lawes? And not with∣out
good cause: for it noteth iustice, and desire to go∣uerne
aright, knitting the Subiects to their Prince.
Neuerthelesse, we see that in former times the Princes
of this Land, and of <HI>France,</HI> as of òther States, did con∣stitute
of themselues many good lawes in force at
this day. So touching the second, there be some States
that by custome and willingnes to complease their
subiects, will seldome make warre, or entertain peace,
without priuate consent of their Councell, or general
debating of the Parliament. Likewise of the third
there is amongst States and gouernements, a great di∣uersitie,
in the instituting and ratifying of principall
officers: which custome hath been brought from the
Prince or State no doubt, for the shew of the Com∣mon-weales
good; so the same be not transported to
forraine States, as the Pope arrogateth in Ecclesiasti∣call
promotions. And touching the last point we see
also how great Princes are stripped of their Soue∣reignty,
<PB N="110" REF="66"/>
reigntie, by the Pope in matters of appeale, of giuing
pardons and such like regalities to subiects, and great
offenders against their Prince and countrey. Thus in
these let Trauailers euerie where make obserua∣tion
how of custome either the States doe hold their
Souereigntie, or howe by like Custome they haue
abbridged or lost their marks of absolutenesse. Lastly,
let it be considered of the customes and preroga∣tiues
of the Nobilitie of a nation; the chiefe whereof
resteth in their superioritie and preheminence in
sitting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customes of the Nobilitie,</NOTE> going, talking, eating, washing, subscribing,
arrogating peculiar phrases, and order of stile in wri∣ting,
and such like. All which are to be considered
by times, places, and persons, that thus and by a custo∣marie
dutie and respect honour each other. Wherein
if Trauailers wilbe verie iudiciall, they had neede to
be good heralds and studious in the customarie lawe
and discipline of Armes of that nation. Hitherto con∣cerning
the lawes and customes of a nation, so briefly
as we could, to the vnexpert in the affaires of the
countrey. The fift point of knowledge now offereth
it selfe, which is concerning the gouernment of the
countrey.</P>
<P>5 The <HI>Gouernment</HI> hath a twofold managing ther∣of:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fift point of knowledge▪ Concerning the gouermēt.</NOTE>
the one exterior and discernable, the other interi∣or,
secret and priuate onely, in a wise State, to the
Counsel thereof, or onely lodged in the breast of the
Prince, which to a wise Prince is a high pointe of
politicke gouernment. Of this interior we will giue
Trauailers a secret taste in the last part, namely, in
the Secrets. For, the obiect of a Trauailer is proper∣ly
the publike and reuealed gouernment. In this Go∣uernment
<PB N="111" REF="66"/>
three things concurre. First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things remarkeable in the gouernmēt</NOTE> the persons
gouerning; secondly, the people gouerned; lastly,
the common and speciall policie, or instruments, that
subsist for the establishing of a cōmon good towards
all men; by the vertue wherof, life, health, peace, pro∣speritie
and happinesse without interruption is con∣ueyed
vnto the bodie politick: Wheras the defect and
vicious ordering of things, soon corrodeth, or putteth
the same into a consumptiō irreuocable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. The persons gouerning.</NOTE> Concerning
the persons gouerning, we obiect to Trauailers a tri∣ple
consideration according to the three-fold diuersi∣tie
of Cōmon-weales. For, by the persons gouerning
we meane also those simple variable three formes of
gouernment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three formes of gouerment.</NOTE> namely, the Monarchial: which is when
the Soueraignty and supreme authority, without con∣trolment,
resteth in one person or Prince, as in our
King of <HI>Great Britaine.</HI> The Aristocraticall is when as
the lesser part of the people, or of the Nobilitie haue
the Souereigntie in body, giuing lawes to the rest of
people in generall and particular, as the Seigniorie
of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the State of the vnited Prouinces in
the Lowe Countreys. And the Democraticall or
popular Estate: which is when as the whole people,
or greater part thereof in bodie, hath the Souereigne
authoritie. Which had neede to bee well conside∣red
of Trauailers, by so much the more as they see
great learned men confounded or deceiued in the
iudgements of them. For, neither the qualities of
persons can change the nature or number of
them; nor can there bee any mixt State of forme
and continuance, but either by Graunt, Permissi∣on,
Communication, Association, or Assignation
<PB N="112" REF="67"/>
of the Souereigne power, to the members subiect.
But lest Trauailers might be misseled by the opinions
of others, let them obserue diligently, in what persons
and in which of these, those foure markes of Soue∣reigntie
(before spoken of in the Customes of the
Countrey) doe reigne; which here for breuitie I o∣mit,
especially the ordering of officers, the decreeing
of peace and warre, and taking of Appeales. But for
the publishing of lawes, the most ciuill States for the
better securitie of them, and content of the people
are euer assisted in Monarchies with the three Estates.
And in some States also for the better dispatch of
things, many of the other three markes are commit∣ted,
but yet restrictiuely, and vnder controulement.
Wherefore let Trauailers consider now these things
aright, and proue the censures of other men, by those
markes of Souereigntie which inuest the formes
with supreme power. Moreouer, in the second place
let Trauailers note, what principall officers are in the
commitment ordained to helpe the motion and go∣uernment
of the helme of the State. And lastly, how
farre their seuerall offices doe extend. For the better
insight into which, there may bee gathered a triple
consideration of officers, namely; first, such as stand
by ancient right and Custome, as those which we cal
Officers at the Common Lawe: Secondly, such as
haue their authoritie by Commission, and that from
the prerogatiues of the Prince or State Souereigne:
Lastly, such as are ordained by the positiue lawes of
the land to vndergo any businesse for the good of the
Common-weale. Finally, let Trauailers be carefull to
obserue the maner and order of making &amp; publishing
<PB N="113" REF="67"/>
of lawes there vsed; the course of entertaining warres;
the ordinarie policie vsed in time of peace, concerning
preparation for warres defensiue and offensiue; the com∣mon
course of proceeding in iustice and iudgement,
the places, and times, and ministers; the fashion of pu∣nishing
&amp; rewarding of all sorts of people acording to
their deserts, and such like appurtenances &amp; appendices
of the gouernment. Let these suffice for the persons
gouerning.</P>
<P>The <HI>People gouerned,</HI> wee cast into sixe moulds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. The gouer∣ned.</NOTE>
namely into that of Husbandmen, of Handicrafts men,
and Labourers; of Marchants, of the Nobilitie and
Gentrie, of stipendarie Souldiers, and of Ecclesiasti∣call
persons. As touching the three first of these, the
lawes of most States will discouer howe they bee go∣uerned.
But as concerning the Nobilitie and Eccle∣siasticall
persons, they assume in most States much li∣bertie:
Of whome let it be sufficient for our Trauailer
to note, how they liue and what they are enclined
vnto.</P>
<P>And as concerning Stipendarie Souldiers (if the
State afford any) let it be considered, how they are
disciplined, and by whom, their number, their priuiled∣ges,
and lastly their entertainment.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. The policie or Instruments</NOTE> the last point to be considered in the gouern∣ment
concerneth the common and speciall policie or
instruments, whereby the gouernors conuey nourish∣ment
vnto the gouerned to vphold the cōmon health
of the State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meanes how to discern the policie.</NOTE> or to plucke the same vpon the knees.
These speciall policies or instruments may be surueyed
of Trauailers in three things.</P>
<P>First, in the goodnesse or illnesse of the Coūtries laws,
<PB N="114" REF="68"/>
and customes. Secondly, in the accidents that moue
the soueraigne Power, for the presēt standing of things,
to cōstitute and decree timely, and broche such policies
as may encounter cure and remoue any disease, surfaite
or distemperature growen, or growing in the bodie
politick, till by a law those inconueniences may be pre∣uented.
The contrarie will chaunce where such defect
reigneth. Lastly, in the due execution of such lawes as
are enacted and in force: the which vnite or disioyne
the bodie, most firmely, or in piecemeales; so as there
cannot but arise from the one a sweet and tuneable har∣monie
of gouernment, and from the other all iarres
and discordes: the which shall minister to Trauailers
plentie of matter to plot policies vpon. Thus much of
the policies.</P>
<P>The sixt and last point of knowledge now remai∣neth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sixt point of knowledge, concerning the secrets.</NOTE>
which is of the <HI>Secretes</HI> of the State where men trauaile;

<P><HI>The Secrets</HI> are those things which are neither noted
nor learned of the vulgar sort of people: they are not∣withstanding
common and accidentall, the which doe
oft change one into another. The <HI>Common Secretes</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Common secrets of two sorts.</NOTE> rest
in two points in the intelligence of such as are forreine
friends, newters or enimies to the Countrie wherin one
trauaileth: And in the knowledge of the ordinarie
strength of the State of the Countrie in which men tra∣uaile.
The first of these considereth friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Forraine.</NOTE> newters, and
enimies: Out of which though there be seuerall secrets
to be extracted, yet we will for breuitie giue our Trauai∣ler
a release of them in the discouerie of friends; since
<PB N="115" REF="68"/>
the rest may either <HI>è diuerso</HI> or <HI>conuer so</HI> be displaied.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A consideratiō of friends to an estate.</NOTE> Of
friends therefore in this kind, namely political, there is a
triple regard. First, by bloud and neerenesse of kinne:
Secondly, by religion and profession of one and the
same faith; Lastly, by meere politicall coniunction of
friendship, confedracie, alliance and league, to settle &amp;
secure &amp;c. each others State in peace, &amp; safetie. Now,
since all these friends in matters of State are euer neerest
to themselues, running the straightest course for the
good of their owne estates, few can be found so honest
&amp; firme as their friendships are neuer disioynable. How∣beit
we might see a rare example twixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
in times past. And thoughe Religion bee the
streightest conioyner of States: yet when Ambition
or couetousnesse or selfe-loue inuade a body politicke,
sildome the friendshippe of such continue longer then
they will aide and cherish those greedie appetites; Enuy
and feare of ouermuch greatnesse making the one an
hypocrite to hunt with the hounde, and runne with the
hare, according to the prouerbe. From the politicall
cōiunction of friendship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sorts of friends politi∣call.</NOTE> we gather two sorts of friends
to euerie State: namely the pleasurable, who for com∣modities
&amp; marchandise are chiefly retained for friends,
to enrich their States in times of peace &amp; accommodate
them with things needefull mutually. Hence we behold
the lawfulnesse of Christian States to traffick with Pa∣gans
and Infidels.</P>
<P>For, contractes of peace and entercourse of com∣modities
may be betweene any Nations, since the par∣tition
wall is broken down; it being a rule of charity for
one State now to entertain &amp; relieue another, with such
commodities as the one either standeth in neede of, or
<PB N="116" REF="69"/>
excelleth the other in. Neuerthelesse, in leagues, alli∣ances
and confederacies, for war, it standeth otherwise
twixt Christian and Pagan Princes. That other sort of
friends are the profitable, who for the politicall defence
and offence are collegued and allianced or cōfederated
with, either to be relieued for iniurie and wrong recei∣ued,
or to be defended against oppression and violence,
or in policie only for feare of sensiblenesse and feare of
the worst. Moreouer, it is not sufficient for a Trauailer
to note thus, who be pleasurable &amp; profitable friends to
that Countrie wherein he trauaileth, but to weighe al∣so
by all meanes the power and strength or weakenesse
of those friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strength of friends,</NOTE> Newters or enimies, to that Countrie.
The which may be discouered to our Trauailer in foure
points. As first in the populousnesse of them, or de∣fect
of people, and in the well disciplining of them; or
sufferance to liue <HI>ad libitum,</HI> and without any Martiall
gouernment. For, from hence ariseth one maine secreat
to our Trauailer, That those Coūtries so strengthened
may be presumed vpon for great friends: and contra∣riwise.
So the second resteth in the neere neighbour∣hood
or fitnesse of such friends to impeach an enimie.</P>
<P>The third may bee noted in the commodities of
those friends to aide and succour that State in cases of
necessitie, with victuall, munition, Armes, horses, ship∣ping
and money; which are the arteries, veines, sinews
and muscles of bodies politicke, in forreine troubles.
Of which this secret riseth; That such friendes so
well furnished must euermore bee well and euenly
dealt with: considering they are daungerous ene∣mies
or neuters; the rather in regard, before a State
can be sensible of their enimitie, they can suddainly
<PB N="117" REF="69"/>
offend. Neuerthelesse, let Trauailers in this point
consider what care those States take, to reteine from
trafficke, munition offensiue: For it is a weaknesse
and danger to tolerate the trafficke of munition of∣fensiue,
to friend or neurer, the which in time
may beard ones selfe, and speake terrour in the
eares of the first owners. The fourth and last con∣cerning
the strength of friendes remaineth: that
Trauailers prie into the reuolution of those States
in three things: as, in the Religion of those States; in
their Warlikenesse; and in their Freedome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious friends.</NOTE> Of these
briefly. And first let vs treate of their religion; whe∣ther
those friends hold the same religiō that the State
whereof they are friends doth, or whether of a con∣trarie
profession; the one yeelding euer a more steady
loue, than the other. And in case of contrary religion,
such friends are soone lost, and soone presse a people
to be mortall enemies. From whence flowe infinite
secrets of this kinde, familiar to good States-men.</P>
<P>Touching the warlikenesse of friends, that may be
considered either in their good discipline at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warlike frends,</NOTE> or
the employment of their people abroad in forraine
warres. Out of which let a Trauailer note this secret,
that such are strong friends and to bee put in trust:
whereas those States that bee so exceedingly desi∣rous
of peace, that they neglect the ordinary disci∣pline
of warre, are either weake and impotent friends,
or vnsteady and wauering. Moreouer, from whence
an other maine secret ariseth: that populous and rich
States, which chuse rather to yeeld to seruitude, by
paying tribute, taxes and other intolerable burdens,
then to defend their liberties (vnlesse in special cases)
<PB N="118" REF="70"/>
are neither trustie friends, nor great enimies, to bee
feared. For, that State which preferreth not his
owne libertie, cannot be sensible of anothers, in such
sort as is requireable.</P>
<P>Lastly, concerning the freedome of friends, there is
a diuers standing: namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freedome of friends.</NOTE> from miserie, and from sub∣iection.
Of freedom from misery we see most States
of <HI>Europe</HI> at this day, vnlesse where vsurpers or ty∣rants
rule, and dominiere. Of freedom from subie∣ction
there is a proper &amp; improper constitutiō. Those
States are properly free, whose policie hangeth not
vpon any forrain power, acknowledging no other su∣periour
than God, either in Temporal or Ecclesiasti∣call
matters; nor that are tributary, or homagial to a∣ny
forreine State. Such at this day is <HI>England, Moscouy,
Turkie, Persia,</HI> &amp; <HI>Tartaria,</HI> and that of <HI>Prester Iean,</HI> who
of the rest vanteth, that his Nation was neuer conque∣red;
or acknowledged any other forreine Prince.
Those that improperly are free, are such States as ei∣ther
acknowledge other superiour, or equall Lord or
Lords, in Ecclesiasticall or Temporall matters, than
God, &amp; their politicall Lord or Lords, or are tributary
or homagiall in any respect to forreine powers. Such
in the first sense at this day are <HI>France, Spaine,</HI> the Em∣pire,
<HI>Italy, Denmarke,</HI> and all those States that hold of
the Pope or Emperour. So, such of the second clause
are those States thorow the world, that pay and yeeld
a certain taxe, homage, or tribute, for acknowledging
and respecting their subiection. Hence it may bee in∣ferred,
that those friends can doe a State little profit,
that are in distresse themselues, as ingaged with inte∣stine,
&amp; ciuil distemperatures; or afflicted by an equal
<PB N="119" REF="70"/>
or greater enemie, as iealous of some great and immi∣nent
danger themselues: or that be not well discipli∣ned,
or not at libertie to dispose of themselues with∣out
those States to whom they are subiect: or in case
any of their possessions bee in question, as belonging
to an other equall or greater Power. All which, in a
word, may Trauailers cōfirme to themselues, in those
States ouer which the Pope hath any stroke; who
arrogating a power to disioyne the members from
the head, and to set the Subiects against their Prince,
can also make debate twixt Prince and Prince, State
and State. Thus much of the first poynt of forreine
friends, &amp;c. to the Countrey, into which men tra∣uaile.</P>
<P>Now touching the second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. The State at home discern∣able in foure points.</NOTE> which we named, to
consist in the knowledge of the ordinarie strength of
the State of the Country in which men trauaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1, Sufficiencie of people.</NOTE> there
are 4 things cōsiderable; the <HI>Sufficiēcie</HI> of the people;
<HI>Store</HI> of commodities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2, Store of cō∣modities.</NOTE> not only to nourish the people
within the land, but to make &amp; procure friendship in
speciall cases; plenty of <HI>Munition,</HI> either offensiue or
defensiue; and the fulnesse of <HI>Treasure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3, Munition plenty.</NOTE> Reuenue, and
Domaine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4, The Trea∣surie,</NOTE> Of these foure we haue handled the three
former thorowout our Treatise, sufficiently for a Tra∣uailer.
But the fourth, that is to say, the Domaine or
Treasure, wee had neede to touch a little. First, let it
be considered therefore, that in Monarchies there is a
priuate and a publike reuenue and treasure: the pub∣like<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priuate and publicke.</NOTE>
being dispended for the good of the Common-weale;
whereas the priuate patrimonie of Princes are
dispendable on their necessities priuate: yet these
are oft confounded. But the first that chaunceth to
<PB N="120" REF="71"/>
the consideratiō of Trauailers, is to note what summe
those ioyntly or seuerally doe amount vnto. Where∣by
they shall be able to discerne the riches and pouer∣tie
of States, <HI>computatis computandis.</HI> This maine se∣cret
brocheth three considerations; First, how and
on what the summe is gathered: secondly, how that is
disposed: thirdly whether there be not alwayes a re∣seruation
of treasure, for the suddaine and needfull vse
of those States.</P>
<P>Touching the first of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seuen meanes whereby trea∣sures are ga∣thered. 1. Reuenue.</NOTE> we obserue from poli∣ticians
seuen wayes that amasse publike treasure and
reuenew, honourably. First, by reuenue which wee
tearm here in <HI>Englād</HI> the profits of the Crown-lands,
of Wards, Mariages, of Reliefs, of Eschetes, of Fines,
of Forfeitures, of Amercemēts, of Iurisdictions ordi∣nary
as extraordinarie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Conquest.</NOTE> and such like. Secondly, by
conquest vpō the enemie. Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Gifts.</NOTE> by gifts of friends
and wel wishers to the State and Crowne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Tribute.</NOTE> Fourth∣ly
by pension and tribute of subiected States and Al∣lies.
Fiftly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Trafficke.</NOTE> by trafficke: the which to some States is
very gainefull. Sixtly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6. Merchandise</NOTE> by Merchandise and trade of
strangers or subiects, frō whence ariseth the Impostes
&amp; Customs vpon euery commoditie brought in or
caried out of States.<NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Taxations.</NOTE> Lastly, in case of necessity the se∣uēth
may be added: wherof in some driuē States there
is ordinarie and extraordinarie (as for casuall they be
included in the former).<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordinarie and extraordinary.</NOTE> The ordinarie are such as we
call Subsides, Lones, Tenths, Fifteenths, stipends,
and asseasments for Souldiers prest. The extraordi∣narie,
are taxes, tallages, gabels, and beneuolences,
either imposed vpon particulars, or in speciall cases
vpon the most in generall. Out of all which let Tra∣uailers
<PB N="121" REF="71"/>
note, what and how much of either and in what
order the same are rated, leauied and assembled into the
treasurie. From whence they may collect this and
such like secrets, That vnlawfull and great impositions
and taxes in a free State do oft cause a heart-burning of
the Commons, and openeth the passage of sedi∣tion,
vnlesse in especiall cases, in which there ought
to bee a publike ouerture for the same as for the ex∣pense.</P>
<P>Moreouer, that may not be ouerslipped, Whether the
the Princes or States where men trauaile, are en∣forced
vppon important accidentes to take vp money
by imprestes and borrowinges, or by mortgages or
at interest. For, as amongst priuate persons, so
in publike States more sodainely there groweth a great
defect, and bankeruptnesse, which is subiect to daun∣gers.</P>
<P>Now, as touching the maine secret of employing
the treasure and reuenewe of the State in the second
place wee finde sixe honorable causes to dispend the
same (out of which a Trauailer may cull seuerall se∣crets:
as the good and orderly gouernement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6, Causes to exhaust trea∣sures.</NOTE> or contra∣riwise,
of the Prince or State, his or their vertues or vi∣ces
&amp;c.) namely Almeshouses and publike reliefe and
prouision for the poore of the Realme;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Almeshou∣ses.</NOTE> whereby is dis∣couered
a religious and charitable care of such as stand
in neede.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Housekee∣ping.</NOTE> vpon the honorable and necessarie
support of the house-hold and publike Court of the
Prince or State: which, being well husbanded, argueth
maiestie, bountie and wisedome.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="72"/>
Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Reparations and buildings needfull.</NOTE> vpon reparations and edifications of forti∣fications
and buildings; of building ships and shipping,
and such like publike matters of the State, which deser∣ueth
a publike and peculiar regard of subiects &amp; State,
and taketh away the hatred of taxes and impositions
by rendering the same back againe to the hands of par∣ticulars
and States good, wherby profit, honour and
securitie ariseth.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Due pay∣ments.</NOTE> vpon the due payment of Souldiers and
men of Martiall affaires; the which argueth discretion
and high care to encounter infinite occasions of euills,
both growing in the Commanders as common souldi∣ers,
whereof a prying care must be had.</P>
<P>Fiftly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Gifts to strā∣gers and offi∣sers.</NOTE> vppon strangers, as Embassadors and such
of forraine Nobilitie as are therby retained in loue and
office to bee tenderers of the honour and weale of
those States, of visiting Princes, and also vpon Officers
and men of good deserte within the State. Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6. Donatiues politicke.</NOTE> vpon
the policie of the State it self, for retaining of friends or
procuring thē by donatiues politicke, &amp; lendinges: out
of which arise many secreates, according to the seuerall
motions or actions of a Prince or State in vertuous or
vitious dispending the same.</P>
<P>The last point of this common secreat, is to note
what ordinarie and extraordinarie treasure is euermore
reserued in the State. And as it is a daungerous thing
in times of warre and troubles to vndertake businesse
vppon borrowings or vsurie, vnlesse in speciall cases;
so also it is perilous to assemble a greater treasure, then
is meete: for that causeth subiectes oft to murmur if
the same come from them, or inuiteth other States
<PB N="123" REF="72"/>
to picke quarrelles to be nibbling therewith. Lastly,
whether there be such niggardlinesse of the Prince see∣king
to spare treasure, as hee diminish much the digni∣tie
of his household and also the Maiestie of his per∣son.</P>
<P>Whereof wee read, that King <HI>Lewis</HI> the Eleuenth
of <HI>France</HI> (whome <HI>Philip de Comines</HI> so much extol∣leth)
so farre diminished his houshold as hee forbad
his Nobles to followe him in Court (at the least at
their owne charges) as that hee was faine to employ
his Taylor for his Heralde at Armes, his Barbar for
an Ambassadour, and his Physician for Chauncellor.
And for his person, hee was so respectlesse, as hee
continually ware an olde course cloth Cappe, and
leauing a recorde for buying a paire of meane sleeues
to an olde plaine doublet of his. And also in his ac∣comptes
was obserued to pay xv. pence for so much
dripping to grease his bootes. Thus much concer∣ning
the common Secreats. <HI>Quaere tamen si sit fru∣galitatis
causa, &amp; propter Reip. bonum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Accidentall</HI> follow; which are such as chance
daiely in or without a State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secrets Acci∣dentall,</NOTE> and that so diuersely as
that we can but giue an assaie or taste of thē to Trauai∣lers
in this treatise. For, euerie action of the State
wherin one trauaileth, or of other forraine States vn∣fould
secreates and are meete materialles to diuine of
future things▪ which now in the <HI>interim</HI> is to be requi∣red
of Trauailers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where those secrets may be discerned.</NOTE> Those accidentall secrets are to bee
sought in three thinges: namely, in the persons
gouerning; in the persons gouerned: and in the in∣strumēts.
From the persons gouerning I obserue these
points; First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Negotiatiōs and Contracts.</NOTE> what be the negotiations and contractes
<PB N="124" REF="73"/>
the State or Prince offereth and maketh with other
States frō time to time: the which although they seeme
hard to come by, yet discreet carriage and liberalitie
will purchase them. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n by election and by inheritance.</NOTE> what order euerie prin∣cipalitie
hath in the succession of their gouernour, whe∣ther
by election or by inheritance. The first ordai∣ning
of a Prince by election was good, to auoyde all
such wants and imperfections, as raigne ordinarily in
Princes hereditarie: yet such corruption inuadeth this
age, that sildome soueraigne Princes will constitute
their vicegerent, or elect Prince of an other State, a man
popular, or that is wiser then themselues. And sildome
wil subiects, that are few in number to make election,
elect men of more spirit, wisedome &amp; worthinesse then
thēselues, vnlesse in special cases: wherof the Colledge
of the Cardinalls and the Electors of the Emperor find
ease and profitte. Those Countries that are by succes∣sion
of inheritance, are likewise of two sorts, generall
and speciall. Moreouer, vnder this maine secret, depen∣deth
the insight into the Lawes concerning the dispo∣sing
of the Crowne; and the Wils, testaments and de∣uises
that are made by Princes, to bequeath the same, so
farre forth as they in right may be stretched.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heires appa∣rant, &amp; infants of the State.</NOTE> concerning States that go by inheritance,
let it be considered who be the next apparant heires to
the State, either by the law of the Countrie, or the law
of Nature, or other pretences. Vnder which also let it be
noted, how, where, and after what order those infants
are brought vp, and what hope there is of them. Fourth∣ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A due conside∣ration of the person of the Prince that ruleth.</NOTE>
what wisedome and discretion the Prince is of:
whether hee be wise enough to discerne the aduise of
his Councell, subtile enough to perceiue whether his
<PB N="125" REF="73"/>
Councell plot more for their owne particulars then
for the publike good and honour of their Soueraigne:
or whether he rule not all things at his wil without con∣sult
of his Councell: what spirit he is of, how stu∣dious
to warre and peace: what care and order the
Prince taketh to see good iustice done to euerie one;
and so of all other vertues that crowne Princes with
honor, and establish their gouernment: the like a∣rise
of the Magistrates. But the contrarie must bee
gathered from the imperfections &amp; vices of the Prince
and Magistrates, <HI>mutatis mutandis.</HI> Lastly, what choise
of persons the Prince hath about him for fauourites,
and whether hee carrieth an euen hand amongst them.
By which secrette the inclination of the PRINCE
and his abilitie and weakenesse maye bee conclu∣ded.</P>
<P>Concerning the persons gouerned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The considera∣tion of the people gouer∣ned in sixe points.</NOTE> our assaie re∣steth
in sixe Considerations; First, whether the people
bee giuen to much libertie and so suffered to conti∣nue,
as in the State of <HI>Venice</HI> and through <HI>Italie:</HI> Se∣condly,
howe they stand affected to their Prince and
gouernment. Thirdly, whether the Commons sup∣pose
not they see much into gouernment, and think
themselues wiser then the Councell of State: the which
is dangerous, whether the same be deriued from pre∣sumptiō
of Nature, or frō the inspectiō the people haue
into the gouernours cariage conuerting all things to
priuate commoditie.</P>
<P>Fourthly, how the people stand affected in rumors
of warre, &amp; like accidents. Fiftly, who are the persons in
greatest fauor and estimation amongst the people, be∣sides
the Prince.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="74"/>
Lastly, whether the Nobilitie contemne not the
Commons and Citizens, and whether the Commons
hate and enuie not the Nobles in outward shew; the
which breedeth a great thirst after alteration, either of
religion or of policie: the one springing from
zeale, the other from malcontednesse and factious∣nesse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Instruments</HI> follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The instrumē∣tall secrets obserued in eight points.</NOTE> which likewise be the sub∣iects
of many secrets and may be included vnder eight
heads, namely, vnder Dearth of the commodities of
the land▪ Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1, Dearth.</NOTE> vnder Mortalitie of men, and the
heauie hand of God on the people. Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Mortalitie.</NOTE> vnder
the Losse of shipping,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3, Lostes.</NOTE> of Munition and Dominions.
Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Defect of Iustice.</NOTE> vnder the Want of Iustice and good disci∣pline.
Fiftly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Riot and ex∣penses.</NOTE> vnder the extraordinarie cause of Ex∣pense,
or the lauishe spending of the treasure. Sixt∣ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6, Impositions.</NOTE>
vnder the strange Impositions and exactions on sub∣iectes.
Seauenthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7, The good or euill of the State.</NOTE> vnder the apprehension of that
which most impouerisheth or enricheth a State:
Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8, Weaknesse of the State.</NOTE> vnder the knowledge of such Weake places
vpon the borders &amp; confines and costes of the Coun∣trie,
as also within the Land; wherein I would aduise
Trauailers to bee verie studious: for so much as this
point only is of great moment to bee well sought into.
Out of which there arise contrarie secreates, <HI>mutatis
mutandis:</HI>
Whereof, Trauailers cannot be ignorant,
being so common and familiar. Finally, about these
or any other, let not Trauailers omitte, to procure
with their purse, what by discretion, obseruation, and
friends, cannot be attained vnto. Thus much concer∣ning
those sixe pointes of generall knowledge, that
accomplish the peregrination of men, and make them
<PB N="127" REF="74"/>
compleate in knowledge of thinges.</P>
<P>It now remaineth to handle briefly, the behauiour
of our Trauailer when he shall returne home, to liue af∣terwards
wel cōtented &amp; happily: the which we see fewe
do. But afore wee can obserue the offices he must vnder
goe, when he commeth home; there are certain points,
of him to be performed before, to fit himself against his
returne, if so be he expect speciall grace and prefermēt
afterwards: which, being an honorable colour &amp; spurre
of vertue, may neither bee neglected of Trauailers nor
indecided of vs. These rest chiefly in two points. First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their discretiō vpon returning</NOTE>
in aduertising, frō time to time by Letters during their
trauaile, some one of the priuie Councell, and none o∣ther
of the Countrie to which they belong, of such oc∣currences
and things as chance worthie to be sent and
committed to consultation and viewe.</P>
<P>Wherein, let Trauailers bee prouident to whom
they giue aduertisement: For, otherwise their labour
may bee lost, or crost with ingratitude and vnthanke∣fulnesse.
Neither, is it necessarie that such a Coun∣cellor
should take knowledge of them before their
Trauaile: for this action will be get acquaintance, and
tie that Councellor afterwards to yeelde such an one
due respect. Neither is it conuenient for Trauailers to
aduertise any other whatsoeuer of those matters they
send to a Councellor, nor to aduertise many Coun∣cellors
of things: the one arguing lightnesse, the other
hazardeth the respect of those Councellors: vnlesse it be
apparant, that the Trauailer is many wayes tied to those
Councellors, in their owne knowledge. Wherein also,
hauing occasion to write of diuerse matters, let him
diuide those matters amongst them with discretion.
<PB N="128" REF="75"/>
Moreouer, let our Trauailer take heede to aduertise an
vntruth for certaintie: but as touching reportes and ru∣mors,
let him handle them discreetly; and touching di∣uinings,
probabilities and consequences, let thē be spa∣ringly
or not at all set downe to Councellers whose
wisedome ought to haue the reference and collection
of them. But vnto other persons and friends they are
sensible and plausible enough. Lastly, in the sending
and dispatching of such letters to Councellers, wherein
are supposed to be importances, let our Trauailer bee
verie circumspect: for it were better for him not to
write at all, then by writing either to hazard himselfe or
bewraie imperfections. And therfore let him take heede
to aduertise any thing that is treasonable, or offensiue
to the State in which he remaineth: Vnlesse such light
vpon good and sound Messengers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> or vnlesse it concerne
the life and safetie of his Prince and Countrie: wherein
only hee ought to hazard his life: especially if his
Prince haue no Ambassadour in that State at the pre∣sent.</P>
<P>Hence springeth that second office to bee perfour∣med
of our Trauailer, That hee make oft repaire to the
Ambassadour of his Prince (in case there remaine any
there) aduertising him of such importances as shall
chaunce vnto him in that Countrey, where hee abideth
with the Ambassadour, before hee committe the same
in writing to any Counceller at home: For that seemes
to derogate from the Ambassador (from whom all im∣portances
are expected besides negotiations) and argu∣eth
no good carriage of such a Trauailer, vnlesse in spe∣ciall
cases; namely, where the cause vrgeth haste to giue
aduertisement, which by distance from the Ambassador
<PB N="129" REF="75"/>
can not so competently bee dispatched, if the same
should be first giuen vnto him; and where the Am∣bassadour
is no friend of that Trauailer. For it is the
office of euery Subiect thus trauailing, whether hee
goe out of the Land, with his Princes Ambassa∣dour,
or be in trauaile before, or trauaile afterwards,
to giue attendance on his Princes Ambassador, espe∣cially
going to the Court. For that is an honour to
his Nation and Prince, and a point of ciuilitie belon∣ging
to the person of an Ambassador; that equalleth,
during his legation, any Subiect in the worlde, if so
such an one be resident, or neere his person. Of which
humanitie an Ambassadour cannot be vnsensible, no
more than the Councellor written vnto, but is tied to
haue his discretion and wisedome in recommendati∣on:
which oft turneth to the good of Trauailers, when
they returne home to their Countrey.</P>
<P>Thus hauing brought home our Trauailer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixe points to be perpended of Trauailers being retur∣ned.</NOTE> there
rest onely sixe offices to be vnder gone of him, where∣by
he shall reape contentment, honour, and estimati∣on.
The first is, that he manifest vnto all men his vn∣corrupt
and vnspotted Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Manifestati∣on of sound Religion.</NOTE> and zeale therein;
Not onely in the due and orderly going to Church,
and seruing of God, but making expression therof by
the fruits of all vertues, demeanours, and actions, and
that singularly in sixe habilities and vertues: namely,
Silence; which vseth few words, but fitly, and to pur∣pose.
Incuriositie; which banisheth all affectations,
and apish trickes, and fashions of other nations,
that are not more estimable then those of ones owne
Countreys Customs and vses. Spirit; which shall free
them from reproche, quarrels, and putting vp of dis∣honourable
<PB N="130" REF="76"/>
iniuries; making him equally sensible with
the Italianated <HI>Duellist,</HI> but farre more iudiciall to take
iust acception, and make risentiment. Prudence,
which being a discreet Councellor, shal direct all his
words and actions according to reason, and to their
proper ends. Bounty, which strippeth him of coue∣tousnesse:
which in Trauailers is hateful, and rellisheth
of dishonesty. Lastly, Faithfulnesse, and sociablenesse;
which shall enable him for all companies, to be both
honestly thought of and regarded: the which is free
from offering wrong, from Lust and Sensualitie, that
dissolue loue and societie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Honestie be∣fore policie.</NOTE> The second office is, that he
preferre not policie before honestie, or equall with it,
either in matters affecting Honour, Wealth, or Re∣uenge;
whereof the Conscience must be a director
and a Counsellor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3, To be known by vertuous in∣deuours.</NOTE> The third is, that he make himselfe
knowen to the Prince and Councell, by commenda∣ble
means onely, in whose hands rest preferment, and
are to be supposed to esteeme men according to their
worth and merit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4, To be stored of a worthy friend.</NOTE> The fourth is in the choice such an
one must make, to procure him an honorable friend,
as is able to haue him in recōmendation to his Prince:
such an one as is not of a couetous minde, but loueth
vertue, and that hath credence with the Prince, &amp; that
is magnanimous, and more feared for his vprightnes,
thā hated for his policie according to <HI>Machiauel.</HI> Fift∣ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5, Constancie without ambi∣tion.</NOTE>
being thus known vnto the Councel, that he couet
not special fauor, after the guise of a sycophāt, or after
an ambitious maner of any other persons; but that he
make shew of a constant and an vnderstanding Gen∣tlemen.
Moreouer, though it be requisite, to be thus
generally knowen of all: yet let such take heede, to in∣trude
<PB N="131" REF="76"/>
into the friendship of any, but with great re∣spect,
and for good cause: vsing modestie and spa∣ringnesse
euermore in reuealing of any thing obser∣ued
in trauaile, vnlesse vpon demands, and in vrgent
causes; and seldome any thing of a strange and incre∣dible
nature, but to familiars, and in priuate. Lastly,
in our sixt point, let our Trauailer from time to time
procure of other Trauailers, Merchants, and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6, Diligence &amp; trauailing at home for ad∣uertisments.</NOTE>
such things as they haue obserued (for it is a thing im∣possible
for one man to obserue all things fully in a
small time, required in trauailing to be knowen, as we
haue considered in the sixe generall points of know∣ledge)
comparing them with his owne; as with such
bookes as happily haue discoursed of them. Finally, let
him plot to haue dayly intelligence (if so be hee liue
from the Court retired) of euery accident forreine
and domesticke in the Court, Land, and Citie: by the
which the obseruations made in trauaile, shal be kept
in continuall tilthe; and being well husbanded, shall
occasion, at the least, sweete contentment (the onely
pleasure in the world, which no worldling can ob∣taine)
if not aduancement in the State to doe more
good than priuate persons in the Church and Com∣mon-weale,
which is the godly and proper ende of
our trauaile and pilgrimage here on earth, that there∣by
God may be singularly glorified, the Prince ser∣ued,
the Common-weale and Church benefited, and
our selues prepared for a greater happinesse, then can
bee represented in any contentment in this life. The
which I hartily wish to be respected of all that intend
trauaile, and to all, in all perfection.</P>
