<FIGDESC>depiction of scenes of torture and execution: a half-naked man hanging stretched in an X on a door frame, his face bound, while a man on a stool pours water over his head and another man tickles him under the arm with feathers; a second half-naked man kneeling in prayer with his hands bound while another man stands behind him with a drawn sword raised to strike; a third half-naked man sitting on the ground</FIGDESC>

<LG>
<L>FRom <HI>India</HI> Land such newes I haue,</L>
<L>of death and deadly dole,</L>
<L>As may inforce a déepe remorse,</L>
<L>to each good Christian soule.</L>
<L>To thinke what English blood was shed,</L>
<L>Vpon a small occasion bred.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>vpon poore innocent soules.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Betwéene the English and the Dutch,</L>
<L>hath béene a long debate:</L>
<L>And mischiefes many hath béene wrought,</L>
<L>against our Merchants state,</L>
<L>Where Merchant-men haue lost their liues,</L>
<L>Their goods, their children, and their wiues:</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>vpon poore innocent soules.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A towne there stands <HI>Amboyna</HI> call'd.</L>
<L>a Castle in the same;</L>
<L>Made rich by these Low-Country States,</L>
<L>and Merchants of great name:</L>
<L>Who on a time a plot deuiz'd,</L>
<L>To haue our Englishmen surpriz'd.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They gaue out words our Englishmen,</L>
<L>by secret treason wrought,</L>
<L>The towne and Castle to blow vp,</L>
<L>and so in question brought,</L>
<L>Our English Merchants dwelling there,</L>
<L>With all that held our Country deare.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their Gouernor a Councell cal'd,</L>
<L>and yet no reason why,</L>
<L>That twenty of our Englishmen</L>
<L>should there their causes try:</L>
<L>Aad answer for a thing not done,</L>
<L>Nor any way there thought vpon.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To cruell tortures day by day,</L>
<L>our English thus were brought:</L>
<L>Where strange tormenting instruments</L>
<L>vpon their bodies wrought:</L>
<L>To make them all confesse and say,</L>
<L>They sought <HI>Amboyna</HI> to betray.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The first they laid vpon a Racke,</L>
<L>with armes and legs abroad,</L>
<L>And spred him, till he did confesse</L>
<L>and most vntruly show'd,</L>
<L>How that our Englishmen conspir'd,</L>
<L>To haue the town and castle fier'd.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>vpon poore innocent soules.</HI></L>

<HEAD>The second Part,</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the same tune.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>THe second of these wofull men,</L>
<L>they bound vnto a stake:</L>
<L>And throtle him about the necke,</L>
<L>till he could hardly speake.</L>
<L>Which cruell torments to auoyd,</L>
<L>Said that the towne should be destroyd.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The third they bound in Iron chaines,</L>
<L>which griped him so sore,</L>
<L>That all his body round about,</L>
<L>did gush out bloody gore:</L>
<L>From which to find some ease he sayd,</L>
<L><HI>Amboyna</HI> should haue béene betrayd.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They whipt the fourth man at a post,</L>
<L>vniustly without fault:</L>
<L>And washt his bloody body ore,</L>
<L>with vineger and salt.</L>
<L>And to the fifth like punishment,</L>
<L>Though to no ill he gaue consent.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With water they stuft vp the sixth,</L>
<L>vntill his body swel'd:</L>
<L>The seuenth likewise with twisted coard,</L>
<L>most barbarously compeld,</L>
<L>To say our English friends were those,</L>
<L>That were the townesmens greatest foes.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe,</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The eight with burning pincers pul'd,</L>
<L>made challenge of the rest:</L>
<L>Though most vntrue, to ease himselfe,</L>
<L>and so false things confest.</L>
<L>So did the nynth by their pretence,</L>
<L>Bring in most wrongfull euidence.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tenth they hung vp by the armes</L>
<L>two foot aboue the ground:</L>
<L>And so with scorching candles burn'd</L>
<L>his back and body round:</L>
<L>With all the other parts about,</L>
<L>Till drops of fat the lights put out.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The rest of these distressed soules,</L>
<L>were vsed in like sort:</L>
<L>At which the cruell Gouernor,</L>
<L>made his tormenting sport.</L>
<L>Till nynetéene of our Englishmen,</L>
<L>Felt more then common tortures then.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>vpon poore innocent soules</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Captaine <HI>Towerson</HI> came in place,</L>
<L>to answer with the rest:</L>
<L>To whom was told the treason was</L>
<L>by those before confest.</L>
<L>Though all as false as God was true,</L>
<L>Yet they affirme, the same he knew.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For which his goods were seized on,</L>
<L>which all our English had:</L>
<L>And so vnto the Iudgement seat,</L>
<L>as traitors they were led.</L>
<L>And there vniustly iudg'd to dye,</L>
<L>Which was performed immediately,</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ten of our men they hang'd forthwith,</L>
<L>the other ten went frée:</L>
<L>Which was a wrongfull Iudgement giuen,</L>
<L>and full of griefe to sée.</L>
<L>That after all these torments past,</L>
<L>They thus should suffer death at last.</L>
<L><HI>Oh heauen looke downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But on the execution day,</L>
<L>as God did so dispose,</L>
<L>A sudden darkenesse and a gust</L>
<L>of violent winds arose.</L>
<L>Which cast two of their ships away,</L>
<L>As they at road in harbour lay.</L>
<L><HI>Thus heauen lookes downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yea here to make Gods vengeance more,</L>
<L>the chiefest of that plot.</L>
<L>In this tormenting of our friends,</L>
<L>as then escaped not,</L>
<L>But felt Gods heauy Iron hand,</L>
<L>And could no way the same withstand,</L>
<L><HI>Thus Heauen lookes downe &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For comming to the graues where as</L>
<L>the murthered bodies lay:</L>
<L>He fell starke mad, and would not thence,</L>
<L>with life depart away.</L>
<L>But dyed most strangely in that place,</L>
<L>Euen as a wretch bereft of grace:</L>
<L><HI>Thus heauen lookes downe, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus haue you heard what bloody déeds,</L>
<L>were late in <HI>India</HI> done:</L>
<L>To make vs all in <HI>England</HI> heere,</L>
<L>with sorrow to thinke vpon,</L>
<L>What sad misfortune should be hap,</L>
<L>To take our friends in such a trap,</L>
<L><HI>Yet heauen lookes downe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Vpon poore innocent soules.</HI></L>
