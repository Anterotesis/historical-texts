<P>All the Protestant Preachers and States of the Land of Ouer-ens are cited to appeare here and to answere for themselues within the space of sixe weekes and three dayes; for the Em∣pretendeth that they haue lost their liues, lands and goods, by reason of their former rebel∣lion, and hath therefore commanded that none shall alter the possession of their estates or of any part of them.</P>
<P>There is likewise published by an open Pro∣clamation, that all the Protestant Preachers which liue yet with such Lords in Austria, as haue beene faithfull to the Emperour must goe out of the Land.</P>
<P>The States of the Land of Ouer-ens hauing gotten notice of this Proclamation, sent the young Lord of Staremberg to his Imperiall Maiestie (who maketh great account of him, to intercede and speake for the Preachers that they might not be banished.</P>
<P>But being come to the Emperour to declare his Commission, he charged him presently to stay with it, vntill the Ambassadours of the

<P>Wee vnderstand by Letters written from <HI>Madrill</HI> the 6. day of October, how that the Duke of <HI>Ossina</HI> dyed on the 20. day of Septem∣ber last past, hauing beene some three yeares in Prison, and that he was very repentant, and ad∣monished his Bastard Sonne (who leadeth the Neapolitan Regiment in <HI>Austria</HI>) that he would not acknowledge any Princes for his soueraigne but the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> or the Emperour.</P>
<P>By the same Letters we learne likewise, how that the Fleet which is to Sayle towards <HI>Brasiel,</HI> to take the Bay <HI>Todos Los Sanctos</HI> again, was not likely to be soone ready; and that they hoped there that the Inhabitāts of <HI>Brasiel</HI> shal recouer it themselues, before their Fleete commeth there.</P>
<P>The Ambassadour of the King of Denmarke hauing dispatched his affaires in the Court of the King of Spaine, he made himselfe ready to goe homewards. And it is rumored that the King of Spaine had restored the Danish shippes which were arrested in Spaine.</P>

<HEAD>Turin the 27 of October. 1624.</HEAD>
<P>SInce my last Letter to you, we haue beene at <HI>Susa,</HI> where my Lord Ambassador went to ac∣company the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> and the French Am∣bassador, and the Venetian Ambassador, to treat and negotiate with the great Constable of <HI>France</HI> concerning the present affaires in these parts, the Constable being accompanied with <HI>Mons: le Mareschall de Crequi,</HI> and with <HI>Monseur de Bullion;</HI> the first being one of the greatest men in all France, the last is priuy Councellor to the French King, being both annexed in commissi∣on with the Constable, and both in quality of ex∣traordinary Ambassadors.</P>
<P>The Marshall <HI>de Crequi</HI> was likewise to condole with the D. of <HI>Sauoy</HI> in the King his Masters be∣half, the death of Prince <HI>Philipert.</HI> After their ari∣uall at <HI>Susa</HI> they had diuers meetings and confe∣rences. Hauing beene ten dayes in the said place they departed, we for <HI>Turin,</HI> the Constable for
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> <HI>Grenoble.</HI> What hath beene treated, and the con∣clusion of the Treaty is not knowne to any as yet, but the common coniecturation is, that they haue resolued to recouer the <HI>Valtolina</HI> by force: and the Constable for the execution hath deter∣mined to make his Troupes passe the <HI>Alpes</HI> with all possible speede, notwithstanding that Winter draweth neere.</P>
<P>This is all I can say concerning the negotiation, time will shew vs the event of the businesse: but one thing I feare much, the Iesuiticall predomi∣nant power. <HI>Fiat voluntas Domini.</HI></P>
<P>In the State of <HI>Milan</HI> they are all in armes, and in readinesse to oppose any that dare come.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Genoa</HI> are more afeard then hurt, they take vp men <HI>alla Gagliarda</HI> to secure their Com∣mon-wealth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Venetians</HI> haue sent for Colonell <HI>Oben∣straut,</HI> being stipendiated by them, and conse∣quently for all those that draw pay of <HI>S. Marco,</HI> what their intention is I cannot tell.</P>
<P><HI>Monseur de Tilly</HI> hath quartered his armie in the Marquisate of <HI>Baden,</HI> and finding his forces too weake to keepe it, hath sent for a supply.</P>
<P>The <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>visses</HI> are all sicke of a Lethargy, and wil hardly be put out of their drowsiness, especially being kept in this sleepe by the Spanish pistols, for the which by degrees they haue almost sold their former liberty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Archduke Leopold</HI> maketh a great shew of
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> leauying troupes, <HI>ma non ha danari.</HI> God keepe him in that case. The Emperour hath sent cer∣taine Commissaries to the Citie of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> with three propositions. First, he desires that the Magistrate of the said citie should deliuer all that are fled out of the Palatinate, with all their goods into his hands, and annexed to this is, that all that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath within that Citie (for they say hee hath a great quantitie of goods and mo∣ney) should likewise be deliuered vnto him. Se∣condly, that they should prepare a great summe of money for to pay the Emperours souldiers. Lastly, they should keepe victuals and munition in readinesse, that whensoeuer occasion should present it selfe that any troops of the Emperour should passe that way, to furnish them withall.</P>
<P>The first proposition they answered them, that in consideration of the priuiledge and liberty of their City, they could not condescend vnto it: as for the other two, they answered, that in an Im∣periall Diett they would resolue as other States and Imperiall Cities should doe.</P>
<P>From <HI>Prage</HI> we heare that the plague reigneth there: and that the Protestants Church hath bin taken from them, and giuen to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> his Ienesaries, (that is to say) his Iesuits.</P>

<HEAD>From Tarim the 9 of November.</HEAD>
<P>Very little Newes are stirring now being a dead time of the yeare, Winter comming on apace: being rather a fit time to consult, then to effectuate any martiall Designes.</P>
<P>From <HI>Milan</HI> wee haue certaine newes, that the Spanish ministers haue intercepted a Packet of letters, sent by <HI>Monseur de Bethunes</HI> Ambas∣sador, resident at <HI>Rome</HI> for the French King, to the Marquis of <HI>Corvare,</HI> likewise Ambassadour for the said King, resident in Suisserland: the contents of the Letter were these; He earnest∣ly entreateth the Ambassadour in Suisserland, to vse all meanes possible to gaine the Suisses to lea∣uie some thousands of men, the number not be∣ing exactly known by me, and those to be imploy∣ed for the recouery of the <HI>Valtolina:</HI> whereupon the Duke of <HI>Feria,</HI> Gouernor of Milan, hath caused sundry copies to be made of the said Let∣ter, sending them where hee thinketh they may most turne to the preiudice of the French, as to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Popes holinesse, entreating him to consider how little the French do respect his ho∣linesse, in respect that the Garisons in the <HI>Valto∣lina</HI> were <HI>Milite di Santa Chiesa,</HI> and that com∣ming against those of the <HI>Valtolina,</HI> was as much as if he made war against the Church. Another
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> Copie he hath sent vnto the Suisses in their Die∣ta at Baden.</P>
<P>From <HI>Berne</HI> wee heare that all our Protestant Cantons haue leauyed a competent number of men, for the defence of themselues, so that if <HI>Tilly</HI> should dare to make any incursion, they may be able to withstand him.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath sent an extraordina∣ry <HI>Ambassador</HI> to <HI>Germany</HI> to assure those Prin∣ces and States that the Troupes hee keepeth in the Empire, or is to send, is not with an inten∣tion to vsurpe any imaginable thing, but that his onely intent and purpose is to settle a quiet and and stable peace in the Empire, and for the ad∣uancement and propagation of the Romane Ca∣tholike Religion.</P>

<HEAD>NEWES FROM the Low-Countries.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>From Bergen op Zoom, Noucmb. 12.</HEAD>
<P>VVE receiued Letters from <HI>Bergen op Zoom</HI> bearing dare this twelfth of Nouember, 1624, that the handmaid of Warre, and scourge of great armies, a cruell Pestilence, rageth and reigneth in his Excellencies armie in the Nether∣lands: by the contagion whereof more haue pe∣rished then by the enemies sword or bullet. It doth not onely rage in the field, as at <HI>Rosendale</HI> and <HI>Longstraten,</HI> where the Prince of Oranges forces lye encamped, but the next good townes feele a portion of this calamity, as <HI>Breda, Bergen op Zoom,</HI> and others.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
<P>The Prince of Orange, to the great griefe of euery good man, was grieuously sicke of this ma∣lady, but God be thanked, hee is reasonable well recouered, to the vnspeakable comfort of al those who fight vnder his banners.</P>
<P>The enemies did much reioyce at the report of this disaster: and it was giuen out in the Spa∣nish quarters, that either he was dead, or else so desperately sicke, that hee was past all recouery. <HI>Quae volumus, facile credimus:</HI> It being an easie matter to beleeue those things which our wils with affectation and earnestnesse doe desire. But yet he liues, and long may liue to fight the battels of the Lord of Hosts, and defend the in∣nocent from the sword of the oppressor.</P>
<P>But see how the Sunneshine of this ioy is sud∣denly ouershadowed with a cloud of sorrow for my Lord <HI>Wriothesly,</HI> sonne and heyre to that ho∣nourable Lord my Lord of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who went ouer in this last expedition into the Ne∣therlands, Captaine of a foot Company vnder his fathers command, being Coronell of one of the foure new Regiments, fell sicke at <HI>Roscndale</HI> in the Princes Leaguer; and to auoid the discom∣modities of the field, he retired himselfe to <HI>Ber∣gen op Zoom,</HI> a towne not farre distant, there to vse the best meanes he could for the recouery and re-establishing of his health.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>
<P>But marke how Gods prouidence ouerswayeth mens prouisions and purposes. He had not lyen there many dayes vnder the tortures of this con∣tagion, but he exchanged this mortall life into immortality, deceasing vpon Sunday last was a sennight, it being the seuenth of Nouember. His noble father comming to visit his son to <HI>Bergen,</HI> fell sicke of this Pestilence also, and what with the violence of the sicknesse, and the griefe of mind for his sonnes decease, hee gaue vp his glo∣rious and now glorified ghost into the hands of his Creator, the Wednesday following, the tenth of Nouember.</P>
<P>These two, both the father and the sonne, wee cannot too much condole nor mourne for their losses, they being as truly honorable in their con∣ditions, as they were in their dignities and cal∣lings.</P>
<P>My old Lord in his younger yeares had tooke a taste of the French and Netherland warres, and after that he was thought worthy by Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of famous memory, to be Generall of her horse in that expedition, which was made vn∣der the conduct of the Earle of <HI>Essex,</HI> against the Earle of <HI>Tiroan,</HI> and other Rebels of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he caried himselfe brauely and vnblemish∣ed. He was a braue Souldier, both for his execu∣tion and knowledge, and likewise learned, as hee was military and valiant.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
<P>Besides he was a great fauorer and <HI>Mecaenas</HI> vnto Armes and Artes, and a liberall acknowledger and rewarder of those who could challenge any dignity from these professions.</P>
<P>His Sonne was the True Image and Chara∣cter of his Father, so that without wronging others by way of comparrison, he was as hope∣full as any young Noble-man in Christendome whatsoeuer. But Is feare me that my poore Panegericke, and commendation doth rather dis∣grace them: then dignifie their Worthynesse; wherefore I will fall from it and a little looke vpon Marquis <HI>Spinolaes:</HI> Leagur, where you shall see the sicknesse raine as bad, as in our Mauritian Quarters.</P>
<P>The Famine griping the hungry maw of your poore souldier, the Itallians and Spani∣ards two Nations who can better indure the Schorching heat, then the cold of Winter, most vehement for the most partes in these Northerne Countries, cursing the ambition of their Prince, which must make their bodies fight against the in∣sufferable difficulties of nature; and therefore for these respects inclining to mutiny and hardly to be commanded.</P>
<P>To aggriuate which calamities, the Marques his Souldiers runne away by parties euery day, their pay falls short, and their Conuoyes which bring their Ammunition bread and other victualls, are dayly cut off by the States Souldiers comming from <HI>Rosendale, Long straten</HI> and elsewhere. A∣mongst the rest it is commonly reported, and
<PB N="16" REF="10"/> most certainely auerred by Letters written from <HI>Geertruydenbergh,</HI> and dated the ninth of this Moneth, that my Lord of <HI>Essex,</HI> and my Lord of <HI>Oxford,</HI> going out vppon a party to seeke some aduenture, met with a Conuoy of the ene∣mies as they were trauailing from the further most parts of <HI>Brabante,</HI> vnto Marquesse <HI>Spinolaes</HI> quarter.</P>
<P>Our English greedy of the pray and Honour besides, giue in roundly vpon these Conuoyes, and after some resistance make themselues Masters of the Waggon-men, and victualls.</P>
<P>But yet it was not <HI>Incruento Victoria,</HI> for some men were lost of both sides, and my Lord of <HI>Oxford</HI> carryed away an Honorable Skarre, and the testimony of his vallor, being wounded in this conflict.</P>
<P>There were twenty waggons or vpwards lost by the Enemies with diuers spoyles of good vallew, which was truely and equally deuided amongst the Souldiers who were Actors in this exployt.</P>

<HEAD>Newes from SPAINE.</HEAD>
<P>Wee receiued certaine information by letters dated at the <HI>Growine,</HI> about the middest of this last Month, that there is great preparation for a mighity Fleete in <HI>Gallicia, Bisca,</HI> and other the more Southerne parts of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>There are besides the Sea-men and Marriners, ten thousand Land Souldiers to bee embarkt in
<PB N="17" REF="10"/> this action. And few of these are <HI>Behemies</HI> or fresh-water Souldiers, but such as are of the Ter∣tiues of their old Garrisons. There is likewise a great impresse and stay of shipping of seuerall Countries, as English, Scots, French, and Easterlins to the great griefe and discontent of their poore maisters and owners, who are like to suffer great detriment and losse by this meanes. The coniectures of this new preparation are di∣uerse: For some giue out that it is for scouring the Leuante and strengthning of their Garrisons in <HI>Naples, Sicilia,</HI> and <HI>Lumbardy:</HI> Others thinke it is against the Grande Signior, and his Vice-royes of Tunes and Argiers, who make their Sanziake ships, and those Harbours which are in them a receite of custome for all Pirats. But those whose iudgements are most curious: Iudge these prepara∣tions to be made against the Hollander for the re∣couering of <HI>Todos los Sanstos</HI> in <HI>Brasilia,</HI> which we may the sooner be indust to beleeue, if we shall but once consider, how loath the Spaniards are to part with any thing which they haue once ap∣propriated and made their owne.</P>
