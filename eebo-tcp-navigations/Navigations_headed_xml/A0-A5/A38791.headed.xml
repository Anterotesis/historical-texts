<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I first chanced upon
this severe piece, and
read it in the Language it was sent
me, I was so much concern'd for the
honour of our Country, that it was
my resolution to suppress the Pub∣lication
of our shame, as conceiving
it an Act of great Inhumanity;
But upon second, and more impar∣tial
Thoughts, I have been tempted
to make it speak <HI>English,</HI> and
give it Liberty, not to reproach,
but to instruct our Nation, remem∣bring
what the Wise-Man hath
said, <HI>Open rebuke is better than
<PB REF="4"/>
secret Love.</HI> Prov. 27. 5. The
truth is, I cannot say but the par∣ticulars,
are most of them, very
home; and which we may no way
evade, without acknowledging, at
least, that the Gentleman (whoever
he were) made notable use of his
time, but best of all, by setting
upon an effectual redress of what is
amiss. And though I doubt not,
but one might easily retort in as ma∣ny
instances, upon defects as great
(if not greater) of that Nation;
(for he that finds fault, had need
be perfect) yet were it then fittest
to do it, and to revenge this Cha∣ritable
Office, when we shall have
first reformed our selves.</P>

<HEAD>A
JOURNEY
TO
ENGLAND, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU Command me to give
you a Minute account of
what I observed, and how I
passed that little time which
I lately spent in <HI>England;</HI> a Country,
whose <HI>Character</HI> you so greatly desire
to be informed of, in a Conjuncture
(as you rightly deduce) of strange Vi∣cissitude,
and indeed they are a Peo∣ple
of all the World most fond of alte∣rations;
And to whom, My <HI>Lord,</HI>
should I more readily submit? First,
encourag'd to make this excursion by
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
your Lordship, who had formerly be∣held,
and so much admir'd the Splen∣dor
and Magnificence of this <HI>Court,</HI>
and <HI>Kingdom</HI> in its greatest <HI>Acme</HI> and
Lustre. But, My <HI>Lord,</HI> I cannot
imagine, that you should esteem me
either of Years, or Capacity to in∣form
<HI>You,</HI> whose Judgment is so Ma∣ture,
and Correspondence so univer∣sal,
as that there is nothing which
can escape your Cognizance, not only
in that <HI>Island,</HI> but in all the VVorld
besides. But since you oblige me not
to dip into the Transactions of State,
the effects of Providence, Time, and
other Notices of a Superiour Orb;
and in which you cannot be instructed
by so weak an instrument as your
Servant; and demand only the little
<HI>Remarks</HI> of my hasty, and desultory
<HI>Peregrination;</HI> though I cannot pre∣tend
to improve your <HI>Lordship</HI>'s
Knowledge, yet I may hope to give
it diversion, and an <HI>Essay</HI> of my Obe∣dience.</P>
<P>It must be avowed that <HI>England</HI> is
a Sweet, and Fertil Country.</P>
<P>Terra potens armis, atque ubere gleba.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
That the Fields,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Descripti∣on of the Country.</NOTE> the Hills, and the Val∣lies
are perpetually clad with a glori∣ous,
and agreeable Verdure; that her
Provisions are plentiful; her Staples
important; and her interest very con∣siderable;
not omitting the most Beau∣tiful
<HI>Ladies,</HI> I had almost said, of the
VVorld,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beauty of the Ladies</NOTE> but for a just respect due to
the Illustrious <HI>Circles</HI> of our <HI>Court,</HI>
where the Beauties of Conversation,
so far transcend the tinctures of Lillies
and Roses. But these, My <HI>Lord,</HI> are
not the <HI>Memoirs</HI> which you demand;
I will therefore hasten to my <HI>Post.</HI></P>
<P>After a short Passage from <HI>Calais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rudeness of the <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI></NOTE>
we came on shore at <HI>Dover,</HI> where
the People of the Town entertain'd us
with such suspicious and forbidding
Countenances, whispering, and stiff
Postures, that I should never have
believed so great a difference in the Ad∣dresses
of two Nations, could have
been produced by so short a trajecti∣on,
and in a Port continually accu∣stom'd
to the Faces of Strangers, had
not the contrary humours of our con∣tiguous
Neighbours, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
made it possible, in so many pleasant
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
instances. But I was amazed, when
we had taken <HI>Post,</HI> and scarce out of
the <HI>Village,</HI> at the Acclamations of the
<HI>Boys,</HI> running after, and affrighting
our Horses, hooting, and crying
out, <HI>French Dogs, French Dogs, a
Monsieur, Monsieur!</HI> By a particular
expression of Welcome, which other
People would interpret Derision; But
in this Triumph (though somewhat
late e'er we set out of <HI>Dover</HI>) we at∣tain'd
as far as <HI>Rochester</HI> the first night,
where, how new a thing it appear∣ed
to me, to see my confident <HI>Host</HI>
set him down cheek by joul by me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confi∣dence of the Inn-Keepers.</NOTE>
belching, and puffing <HI>Tobacco</HI> in
my Face, you may easily imagine,
till I afterwards found it to be the u∣sual
stile of this Country; and that
the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who lodge at their
<HI>Inns,</HI> entertain themselves in their
Company, and are much pleas'd with
their impertinences: Arriv'd at the
<HI>Metropolis</HI> of civility, <HI>London,</HI> we put
our selves in <HI>Coach,</HI> with some Persons
of Quality, who came to conduct us
to our Lodging; but neither was this
passage without honours done to us,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
the Kennel dirt, and roots being fa∣vours
which were frequently cast at
us by the Children, and Apprentices
without reproof; Civilities, that in
<HI>Paris,</HI> a <HI>Gentleman</HI> as seldom meets
withal, as with the contests of <HI>Car-Men,</HI>
who in this Town domineer in
the Streets, o'er-throw the <HI>Hell-Carts</HI>
(for so they name the <HI>Coaches</HI>)
Cursing, and reviling at the <HI>Nobles:</HI>
You would imagine yourself amongst
a <HI>Legion</HI> of <HI>Devils,</HI> and in the suburb of
<HI>Hell.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ill manners of the Commo∣nalty at <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> I have greatly wondered at the
remisness of the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> and the
temper of the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and that the
<HI>Citizens,</HI> who subsist only upon them,
should permit so great a disorder, rather
joining in the affronts, than at all cha∣stizing
the Inhumanity. But, these are
the natural effects of Parity, popular
Libertinism, and Insulary Manners.</P>
<P>I find, as you told me, My <HI>Lord,
London</HI> to be a Town so nobly Scitu∣ated,
and upon such a River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Descripti∣on of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Europe</HI>
certainly shews not one more useful
and agreeable; Their <HI>Fountains,</HI> which
are the Pride and Grace of our Streets,
and plentifully supplyed in this <HI>City,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
are here immur'd, to secure the Wa∣ters
from, I know not what, impuri∣ties:
But certainly, it do's greatly de∣tract
from the beauty of the <HI>Carfours,</HI>
and intercepts the view.</P>
<P>Amongst the piece of <HI>Modern Archi∣tecture,</HI>
I have never observ'd above
two, which were Remarkable in this
vast, <HI>City.</HI> The Church of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s,
and the Banqueting-House at <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
of which I remember to have
heard your <HI>Lordship</HI> speak: But you
would be amaz'd at the <HI>genius</HI> of
these People, that not much above for∣ty
Years ago should suffer this goodly
and venerable Fabrick, to be built a∣bout
and converted into raskally
<HI>Ware-Houses,</HI> and so sordidly obscur'd
and defac'd, that an argument of
great Avarice, Malice, Meanness, and
deformity of Mind, cannot possibly
be expressed: Nothing here of Or∣nament,
nothing of Magnificence, (on∣ly
a heavy piece of Architecture;) no
publick and honourable Works, such
as render our <HI>Paris,</HI> and other <HI>Cities</HI>
of <HI>France,</HI> renowned, and visited by
all the World; emulating even <HI>Italy</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
herself, for her <HI>Palaces,</HI> uniform and
conspicuous Structures: I assure your
<HI>Lordship,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> is the sole spot
in all the World, where among <HI>Christi∣ans</HI>
their <HI>Churches</HI> have been made
Jakes, and Stables, Markets and
Tipling-Houses; and where there
were more need of <HI>Scorpions,</HI> than
<HI>Thongs,</HI> to drive out the <HI>Publicans</HI>
and <HI>Money-Changers:</HI> In sum, where
these <HI>excellent</HI> uses, are pretended to
be the Marks of Piety and Reforma∣tion.
I had sometimes the curiosity
to visit the several <HI>Worships</HI> of these
<HI>Equivocal Christians,</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasts:</HI>
But I extreamly wondred to find
those whom they call <HI>Presbyterians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Descripti∣on of the Prebyte∣rians.</NOTE>
and that would imitate us of the <HI>Re∣ligion</HI>
in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> to have
their <HI>Discipline</HI> so confused and diffe∣rent.
In this <HI>remark,</HI> My Lord, to
be somewhat more particular, you
will not be displeas'd; because it
was a thing you so much recommend∣ed
to my especial Notice. <HI>Form,</HI>
they observe none; They pray and
read without method, and indeed,
without Reverence or Devotion; I
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
have beheld a whole Congregation
sit on their—with their Hats on, at
the reading of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> and yet
bare-headed when they sing them,
in divers places they read not the
<HI>Scriptures</HI> at all; but up into the <HI>Pul∣pit,</HI>
where they make an insipid, te∣dious
and immethodical <HI>Prayer,</HI> in
Phrases, and a tone so affected and
mysterious, that they give it the
name of <HI>Canting,</HI> a term by which
they do usually express the <HI>Gibbrish</HI>
of Beggars and Vagabonds; after
which, there follows the <HI>Sermon,</HI>
consisting (like their Prayers) of
<HI>Speculative</HI> and <HI>Abstracted</HI> Notions,
and things, which, nor the People,
nor themselves, well understand: But
these they extend to an extraordinary
length, and <HI>Pharisaical</HI> repetitions;
'till almost they sleep; I am sure, 'till
their Auditors do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minister</HI> uses no Habit of
distinction, or gravity, but steps up
in <HI>querpo;</HI> and when he lays by his
<HI>Cloak</HI> (as I have observed some of
them) he has the action rather of a
<HI>Thrasher,</HI> than a <HI>Divine;</HI> this they
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
call <HI>taking pains,</HI> and indeed it is so, to
those that hear them: But thus they
have now encouraged every pert <HI>Me∣chanick</HI>
to invade, affront and out∣preach
them; and having cancel'd
all manner of decency, prostituted both
their Persons and Function to usurpa∣tion,
penury and derision. You may
well imagine by the manners of the
People, and their prodigious Opinions,
that there is no <HI>Catechisms,</HI> nor <HI>Sacra∣ments</HI>
duly Administred: <HI>The Religion
of</HI> England <HI>is Preaching, and sitting still
on Sundays.</HI> How they Baptize I
know not, because the Congregation
is dismissed, and they agree in no
form; and for the other <HI>Sacraments,</HI>
no Man gives, or receives alike: Such
of their Churches as I have frequented,
were damned up with <HI>Pues,</HI> every
three or four of the Inhabitants, sit∣ting
in narrow <HI>Pounds</HI> or <HI>Pulpits,</HI> by
themselves; for they are all turn'd
<HI>Preachers</HI> now, In short, there is
nothing more unlike to our reformed
Churches in <HI>France</HI> and I think in all
<HI>Europe</HI> beside; the apprehension of
<HI>Popery,</HI> or fondness to their own ima∣ginations,
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
having carry'd them so far
to the other extream, that they have
now lost all Moderation, and Deco∣rum;
And I have been herein, My
Lord, the more industrious to inform
my self of each particular; because it
seems yet to be as publick as the <HI>Reli∣gion</HI>
of the State. Some of their own
party, I have heard deplore this con∣fusion,
but certainly, they themselves
gave the first occasion to these Mon∣strous
Liberties, by a Rigid, and Un∣charitable
Discipline; primarily (it
seems) introduced by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and
so refined upon by these, as there are
few or none that will submit to the
Tyranny; but every one takes his
own course, and has protection for
it. Some well natur'd abused Men I
have met withal among them; but,
if I mistake not, for the greater Ingre∣dient,
Ambitious, Ignorant, Over∣weening,
Sower, and Uncharitable,
<HI>ne quid asperius,</HI> combining with the
interest of the times, and, who to
render themselves powerful, have in
compliances with the Spirital Pride of
the <HI>Mechanicks</HI> and Corporations, con∣niv'd
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
at those many, and prodigious
<HI>Schisms</HI> and <HI>Heresies</HI> which are now
spawn'd under themin such numbers,
as give terrour to the State. I omit
to tell your Lordship that few take
Notice of the <HI>Lord</HI>'s-Prayer; it is e∣steemed
a kind of weakness to use it,
but the <HI>Creed</HI> and the <HI>Decalogue</HI> are
not once heard of in their Congrega∣tions;
This is Milk for <HI>Babes,</HI> and
these are all <HI>Giants.</HI> They do fre∣quently
Solemnize their late <HI>National</HI>
deliverances, and some days of <HI>Chri∣stian
Bloodshed,</HI> with all possible exact∣ness.
But they think it gross <HI>Idolatry</HI>
to join with the whole <HI>Christian
Church</HI> of all Professions under Hea∣ven,
in the <HI>Anniversaries</HI> of our B.
<HI>Saviours Incarnation, Passion, Resur∣rection,</HI>
and descent of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI>
Spiritual, Eternal, and never to be
forgotten Mercies. Would your
<HI>Lordship</HI> believe that this madness
should advance so far, as to disturb
the <HI>French-Church</HI> there, which you
know, does in all places observe those
signal Deliverances and Blessings,
both by <HI>Preaching, Prayer, Sacra∣ments</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
and Exhortations, apposite to
to the Occasion; What think you
will be the issue of this goodly Refor∣mation?
I could tell you more of the
Mysterious <HI>Classis;</HI> their ridiculous,
insidiary, and presumptuous Questi∣ons;
their unheard of Animosities
against their Brethern of the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>England,</HI> suffering themselves to be ra∣ther
torn in sunder by the <HI>Sectaries,
Demotrius</HI> and the <HI>Crafts-Men,</HI> whilst
they contend about trifles and meer
shadows.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Independents,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Descripti- of the In∣depen∣dents, Auabap∣tists, Quakers, &amp;c.</NOTE> all I
can learn is; They are a refined, and
Apostate sort of <HI>Presbyters;</HI> or, rather
such as renounces all Ordination, as who
having Preached promiscuously to the
People, and cunningly ensnared a Se∣lect
number of Rich, and ignorant
Proselytes, separate themselves into
<HI>Conventicles,</HI> which they name <HI>Con∣gregations.</HI>
There is nothing does
more resemble this <HI>Sect,</HI> than our
Rom. <HI>Missionaries</HI> sent out <HI>in partibus
Insidelium;</HI> for they take all other
<HI>Christians</HI> to be <HI>Heathens.</HI> These are
those great Pretenders to the <HI>Spirit,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
into whose Party, does the vilest Per∣son
living, no sooner ascribe himself,
but he is, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> bubt a <HI>Saint,</HI>
hallow'd, and dear to <HI>God.</HI> These,
are the confidents, who can design
the <HI>minute,</HI> the <HI>place,</HI> and the <HI>means</HI>
of their Conversion: A <HI>Schism</HI> full of
Spiritual disdain, incharity, and high
imposture: But every alteration of
<HI>State,</HI> destroying the interest of the
versatile Contrivers, they are as rea∣dy
to <HI>Transmigrate</HI> into the next more
thriving Fraternity, as the <HI>souls</HI> of
<HI>Pythagoras</HI> into Beasts, and may then
perhaps, assume some other <HI>Title,</HI>
This is a sad, but serious truth, and
not a little menaces the common <HI>Chri∣stianity,</HI>
unless timely prevented. But,
Sir, I will not longer tire your pati∣ence
with these <HI>Monsters</HI> (the sub∣ject
of every contemptuous <HI>Pamphlet</HI>)
nor with the madness of the <HI>Anabap∣tists,
Quakers,</HI>) (which are increased to a
prodigious number) <HI>Fifth Monarchy-Men,</HI>
and a <HI>Cento</HI> of unheard of <HI>Here∣sies</HI>
besides, which, at present, de∣form
the once renowned <HI>Church of Eng∣land;</HI>
and approach so little the pre∣tended
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<HI>Reformation,,</HI> which we in
<HI>France</HI> have been made to believe they
are arrived to.</P>
<P>But I have dwelt too long on this
<HI>remark,</HI> I return to the Town, where
they arc pestred with <HI>Hackney-Coach∣es,</HI>
and insolent <HI>Car-Men, Shops,</HI> and
<HI>Taverns, Noise,</HI> and such a cloud of
of <HI>Sea-Coals,</HI> that if there be a resem∣blance
of <HI>Hell</HI> upon Earth, it is in this
<HI>Vulcans</HI> in a Foggy Day:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Cough.</NOTE> This pesti∣lent
<HI>Smoak</HI> so fatally seizes on the
<HI>Lungs</HI> of the Inhabitants, that the
<HI>Cough,</HI> and the Consumption spare no
Man. I have been in a spacious
<HI>Church,</HI> where I could not hear the
<HI>Minister</HI> for the Peoples Barking.</P>
<P>There is within this <HI>City,</HI> and in all
the Towns of <HI>England</HI> (which I
have passed through) so prodigious a
number of Houses where they sell a
certain Drink called <HI>Ale,</HI> that I think
a good half of the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> may be
Denominated <HI>Ale-House-Keepers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Ale.</NOTE> these
are a meaner sort of <HI>Cabarets:</HI> But
what is most deplorable, where some
<HI>Gentlemen</HI> sit (especially in the Coun∣try)
and spend much of their time;
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
drinking of a muddy kind of <HI>Beverage,</HI>
and <HI>Tobacco,</HI> which has, universally
besotted the <HI>Nation,</HI> and at which (I
hear) they have consumed many no∣ble
Estates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Taverns.</NOTE> As for other <HI>Taverns,
London</HI> is Compos'd of them, where
they drink <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Red-Wines,</HI> and
other Sophisticated Liquors to that
fury and intemperance, as has often
amaz'd me to consider it: But thus
some mean Fellow, the <HI>Drawer,</HI> ar∣rives
to an Estate, some of them ha∣ving
built fair Houses, and purchased
those <HI>Gentlemen</HI> out of their Posses∣sions,
who have ruined themselves by
that base and dishonourable Nice of
Ebriety: And that nothing may be
wanting to the height of Luxury and
Impiety of this <HI>Abomination,</HI> they
have translated the <HI>Organs</HI> out of the
<HI>Churches,</HI> to set them up in <HI>Taverns,</HI>
and even a worse sort of <HI>Tipling-Houses,</HI>
chanting their <HI>Dithyrambicks,</HI>
and bestial <HI>Bacchanalias,</HI> to the Tune
of those <HI>Instruments,</HI> which were
wont to assist them, in the Celebra∣tion
of <HI>God</HI>'s Praises, and regulate
the Voices of the worst Singers in the
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
World, which are the <HI>English</HI> in their
<HI>Churches</HI> at present; I cannot but
commend the <HI>Reformed</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI>
who still retain their <HI>Organs</HI> in the
<HI>Churches,</HI> and make use of them at
the <HI>Psalms,</HI> without any Opinion of
Superstition; and I once remember to
have heard the Famous <HI>Diodati</HI> wish
they might be introduc'd even at
<HI>Geneva.</HI> A great error undoubtedly
in those who sit at the Helm, to per∣mit
this scandal; to suffer so many
of these <HI>Taverns</HI> and occasions of In∣temperance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Women at Ta∣verns, and Drink Healths.</NOTE>
such Leaches, and Vi∣pers;
to gratifie so sordid and base
a sort of People with the spoils of
honest, and well Natur'd Men.
Your <HI>Lordship,</HI> will not believe me
that the <HI>Ladies</HI> of greatest Quality,
suffer themselves to be treated in one
of these <HI>Taverns,</HI> where a <HI>Curtesan</HI> in
other <HI>Cities</HI> would scarcely vouchsafe
to be entertained: But you will be
more astonish'd when I shall assure
you, that they drink their <HI>Crowned
Cups,</HI> and roundly, strain Healths
through their <HI>Smocks,</HI> Dance after
the Fiddle, Kiss freely, and term it an
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
honourable <HI>Treat.</HI> But all this my
Experience, particular address, and
habitudes with the greatest of that
Nation has assur'd me, that it is not
the pass time, only of the inferiour
and <HI>Meretricious</HI> sort;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the hard Drinking at private Houses.</NOTE> since I find it a
chief suppletory at all their Entertain∣ments,
to drink Excessively, and that
in their own Houses, before the <HI>La∣dies,</HI>
and the <HI>Lacques:</HI> It is the After∣noons
diversion; whether for want
of better to employ the time, or af∣fection
to the drink, I know not:
But I have found some Persons of
Quality, who one could not safely vi∣sit
after Dinner, without resolving to
undergo this <HI>Drink Ordel,</HI> and endure
the Question: It is esteem'd a piece
of Wit, to make a Man Drunk, for
which some swilling insiped <HI>Client,</HI> or
<HI>Congiarie,</HI> is a frequent and constant
<HI>adjutant,</HI> Your <HI>Lordship</HI> may hence
well imagine, how heavy, dull, and
insignificant the Conversation is;
loud, querillous, and impertinent.
I shall relate a story that once hap∣pened
in my presence, at a <HI>Gentleman</HI>'s
House in the <HI>Country,</HI> where there was
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
much Company and Feasting. I
chanced to come at Dinner-Time, and
after the Cloth was taken away (as
the manner is) they fell to their lauda∣ble
Exercise: But I unacquainted
then with their Custom, was lead up
into a <HI>With-Drawing-Room,</HI> where
I had the Permission (with a Noble
Person who introduced me) to sit and
converse with the <HI>Ladies,</HI> who were
thither retired; the <HI>Gentleman</HI> of the
House leaving us in the mean time,
to Entertain his Friends below: But
you may imagine how strangely I
was astonished; to see within an hour
after, one of the Company that had Di∣ned
there, entering into the Room all
bloody,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the quarelling among the English.</NOTE> and disorder'd, to fetch a
Sword which lay in one of the Win∣dows,
and three or four of his Com∣panions,
whom the Fumes of the
Wine had inspirited, pursuing, and
dragging him by the Hair, till in this
confusion, one of their Spurs engaged
into a Carpet, upon which stood a
a very fair <HI>Looking-Glass,</HI> and two
noble pieces of <HI>Porselain,</HI> drew all to
the ground, broke the <HI>Glass,</HI> and the
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>
<HI>Vasas</HI> in pieces; and all this on such
an instant, that the <HI>Gentleman</HI> and my
self, had much ado to rescue the af∣frighted
<HI>Ladies</HI> from suffering in the
tumult; but at last we prevailed,
and brought them to terms, the quar∣rel
concerning an <HI>Health</HI> only, which
one of them would have shifted. I
don't remember, My <HI>Lord,</HI> ever to
have known (or very rarely) a
<HI>Health</HI> Drank in <HI>France,</HI> no not the
<HI>King</HI>'s; and if we say <HI>A vostre sante
Monsieur,</HI> it neither expects Pledge,
or Ceremony. 'Tis here so the Cu∣stom
to Drink to every one at the <HI>Ta∣ble,</HI>
that by the time a <HI>Gentleman</HI> has
done his Duty to the whole Compa∣ny,
he is ready to fall asleep, whereas
with us, we salute the whole <HI>Table</HI>
with a single Glass only. But, My
<HI>Lord,</HI> was not this, imagine you; an
admirable <HI>Scene</HI> and very Extraordi∣nary?
I confess, the <HI>Lady</HI> of the
House being much out of Counte∣nance
at what had happened, profered
to excuse this disorder, and I was as
ready to receive it, till several encoun∣ters
confirmed me, that they were but
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
too frequent, and that there was a
sort of perfect: <HI>Debauchees,</HI> who stile
themselves <HI>Hectors,</HI> that in their mad
and unheard of <HI>Revils,</HI> pierce their
Veins to quaff their own <HI>Blood,</HI> which
some of them have Drank to that ex∣cess,
that they died of the intempe∣rance;
These are a professed <HI>Atheisti∣cal</HI>
Order of <HI>Bravo</HI>'s compos'd for the
most of <HI>Cadets,</HI> who spending beyond
their <HI>Pensions,</HI> to supply their extrava∣gances,
practise now and then the
High-Way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Younger Brothers Rob on the High-Way.</NOTE> where they sometimes
borrow, that which they often repay
at the <HI>Gibbet;</HI> an Ignominious Trade,
unheard of amongst our Gallant <HI>No∣bles;</HI>
however Fortune reduce them.
But I know not whether I might not
here Match these Valiant <HI>Hero</HI>'s with
an avowed Society of <HI>Ladies,</HI> and
some of them not of the meanest for
Birth (I even blush to recount it of
that Fair Sex,) who boast of making
all advantages at <HI>Play,</HI> and are be∣come
so Dextrous at it, that seldom
they make a sitting, without design
and Booty; For there is here, My
<HI>Lord,</HI> no such thing as Courtship, af∣ter
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
the decent mode of our <HI>Circles;</HI>
for either being mingled in a Room,
the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> separate from the Con∣versation
of the <HI>Ladies,</HI> to Drink, as
before I related; or else to Whisper
with one another at some Carner, or
<HI>Bay-Window,</HI> abandoning the <HI>Ladies</HI> to
Gossip by themselves, which is a Cu∣stom
so strange to a <HI>Gallant</HI> of our
<HI>Nation,</HI> as nothing appears more bar∣barous
and undecent; and this in ef∣fect:
must needs be the reason, that
these Beautiful Creatures want assu∣rance,
address, and the charming
Discourse of our Damoisels, which
are faculties so shining, and agreeable
in their Sex with us in <HI>France:</HI> And
in truth even the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> them∣selves,
are greatly defective as to this
particular, ill Courtiers, Unpliant,
Morose, and of Vulgar address; ge∣nerally,
not so polished, free, and
serene, as is universally found, even
amongst the most inferiour of our <HI>Na∣tion.</HI>
I am not ignorant that they
impute it to a certain levity m us;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The La∣dies want Address, and Con∣fidence.</NOTE>
but it is a mistake in them, and that
because they so hardly reform it, with∣out
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>
some ridiculous affectation, as is
conspicuous in their several <HI>Modes</HI> and
<HI>Dresses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Have no <HI>Standard</HI> for Dres∣sing.</NOTE> which they vary ten times
for our once; every one affecting
something particular; as having no
Standard at <HI>Court,</HI> which should give
<HI>Laws,</HI> and Countenance the Fashion.
The <HI>Women</HI> are much affected with
<HI>Gaudry,</HI> there being nothing more
frequent than to see an Ancient Lady
wear Colours, a thing which neither
Young, nor Old of either Sex do with
us, save in the Country, and the
<HI>Camp;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Wo∣men in Coloured Clothes.</NOTE> but <HI>Widows</HI> at no time. And
yet reprove they us for these Exorbi∣tances;
but I have often disputed the
case: Either we do ill, or well; if
ill, why then do they <HI>ape us?</HI> if well,
why do they reproach us? The truth
is, they have no Moderation, and
are neither so lucky, nor frugal as our
<HI>Ladies</HI> are in these Sumptuary ex∣pences;
and whereof the <HI>Magistrates</HI>
takes so little Cognisance, that it is
not an easie matter to distingnish the
<HI>Lady</HI> from the <HI>Chamber-Maid;</HI> Ser∣vants
being suffered in this brave
Country, to go clad like their Mistres∣ses,
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
a thing neither decent, nor per∣mitted
in <HI>France,</HI> where they may
wear neither Lace, nor Silk.
I may not forget to acquaint your
<HI>Lordship,</HI> that though the <HI>Ladies,</HI> and
the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> are so shie of one ano∣ther,
yet when once they grow ac∣quainted,
it passes into expressions,
and compellations extreamly new to
our usages, and the stile of our Coun∣try:
Do but imagine how it would
become our <HI>Ladies,</HI> to call <HI>Monsieur</HI>
N— <HI>Jack</HI> N. what more frequent
than this? <HI>Tom.</HI> P— was here to
Day; I went Yesterday to the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A place near <HI>Paris</HI> like <HI>Hide-Park. English</HI> Women have Fa∣miliar ways with them.</NOTE> <HI>Cours</HI>
with <HI>Will.</HI> R— <HI>Henry</HI> M— treated
me at such a <HI>Travern;</HI> These are the
particular <HI>Idioms,</HI> and graceful Confi∣dences
now in use; introduced I con∣ceive
at first by some <HI>Camerades</HI> one
with another; but it is mean and
rude, and such as our <HI>Lacques,</HI> would
almost disdain in <HI>Paris;</HI> where I
have often observed two <HI>Chimny-Sweepers,</HI>
accost one another, in <HI>better Forms,</HI>
and Civiller Addresses. But
to be confident and civil, is not a thing
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>
so easily understood, and, seems a
peculiar talent of our Nation.</P>
<P>However the <HI>Ladies</HI> are not more
obliging and Familiar, than the
<HI>Lords</HI> are difficult and inaccessable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of the Lords surley.</NOTE>
for though by reason of my Birth, and
Quality, my recommendations and
addresses, I found some tolerable re∣ception
amongst them; yet I observ'd,
that they kept at such a surly distance
with the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> even of Family,
that methought I never beheld a ru∣der
Conversation; especially, when
comparing their Parts, and Educati∣ons,
I found them generally so much
inferiour, as if a <HI>Lord</HI> were indeed o∣ther
than a <HI>Gentleman;</HI> or a <HI>Gentle∣man</HI>'s
not fit Companion for a <HI>King:</HI>
But this must needs be the result of an
ill, and haughty institution, and for
that most of these great Persons are in
their Minority, and the Age wherein
they should be furnished with the
noblest impressions, taught only to
converse with their Servants, some
<HI>Sycophants,</HI> and under the Regiment
of a <HI>Pedant,</HI> which imprints that
scornfulness and folly, and fits them
<PB N="25" REF="17"/>
with no better forms when they
should produce themselves, and give
testimony to others, as well of their
Superiority in Virtue, as in Birth,
and Dignity. But this is, My <HI>Lord,</HI>
a particular, which I have heard you
often complain of, and which we do
frequently take notice of, at their
coming abroad into our Country;
where for want of address, and fit
Persons to introduce them, they sel∣dom
return more refined than they
came, else they could not but have
observ'd, that there is nothing which
makes the distinction of <HI>Nobles</HI> in
<HI>France,</HI> but the <HI>Title,</HI> and that his
<HI>Majesty</HI> himself does them the ho∣nours,
which here they usurp upon
their equals; But, My <HI>Lord,</HI> they
are sufficiently punished for it in <HI>Eng∣land:</HI>
Where, to me they appear so
degenerate, for want of this humility
and free Conversation; by which,
and their other Vices, they grow now
so much despised, that the <HI>Gentlemen</HI>
need seek no Revenge: For though
(as I told you) the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> are
most of them very intemperate, yet
<PB N="26" REF="18"/>
the <HI>Proverb</HI> goes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the Pro∣verb, <HI>As Drunk as a Lord.</HI></NOTE> <HI>As Drunk as a Lord.</HI>
But, My <HI>Lord,</HI> as there is no rule so
general, but it does admit of excepti∣ons,
so should I give my own Expe∣rience,
as well as your <HI>Lordships</HI> the
contradiction, to make the Censure
Universal; there being even amongst
<HI>these,</HI> some <HI>few,</HI> and in particular my
<HI>L. P.</HI> my <HI>L. M.</HI> my <HI>L. D.</HI> &amp;c.
whom I esteem to be very noble, and
accomplished Persons, as who have
learned (by the good Fortune of a bet∣ter
Education) how to value the
Conversations of worthy Men, and
who indeed, do sufficiently verefie
all those <HI>Attributes</HI> which are due to
their Qualities, and therefore whom
this <HI>Paragraph</HI> does no ways con∣cern.</P>
<P>Nor should I be less severe and un∣just,
totally to exclude even some of
the <HI>Ladies</HI> from the Advantages of
this <HI>Period,</HI> whose perfections and Vir∣tues,
claim an equal right to all that
I have here spoken, out of a due re∣sentment
of their Merits and Excel∣llencies.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="18"/>
It was frequently,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Balls.</NOTE> during the last
<HI>Winter,</HI> that I was carried to their
<HI>Balls,</HI> as where indeed, I expected to
see what should appear the most of
Gallant, and Splendid amongst the
<HI>Ladies,</HI> nor really did my expectations
deceive me; for there was a confluence
of very great Beauties, to which the
glistering of their Jewels (which up∣on
this occasion they want not) could
add nothing save their <HI>Weight;</HI> the
various Habits being so particular, as
if by some strange <HI>Inchantment,</HI> they
had encountered, and come out of se∣veral
Nations: But I was astonish'd
to see, when they were ready to move,
that a <HI>Dancing-Master,</HI> had the bold∣ness
to take forth the greatest <HI>Ladies,</HI>
and they again the <HI>Dancing-Master,</HI>
who performed the most part of the
<HI>Ball,</HI> whilst the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that were
present, were the least concerned, and
stood looking on; so as it appeared
to me more like the <HI>Farce</HI> of a <HI>Comedy,</HI>
than a <HI>Ball</HI> of the <HI>Nobles,</HI> and in truth,
their measures, when any of them
were taken out, made me some
what asham'd to lead a <HI>Lady</HI> who did
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>
me the honour, for fear (though my
skill is very vulgar in that exercise)
they should have taken <HI>me</HI> for a <HI>Dan∣cing-Master,</HI>
as who had happily im∣ploy'd
my Youth so ill, as to have
some advantage of the rest in that
faculty. This favour is particular to
the <HI>Dancing-Masters</HI> in this Country;
and Reason good; for they have such
ample <HI>Salaries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inso∣lence of the Dan∣cing Ma∣sters.</NOTE> as maintains both their
Prodigality, and an Insolence, that
were insupportable in <HI>France,</HI> where
these trifling Fellows do better know
themselves, are worse payed, and
less Presumptuous. Nay, so remiss
are the <HI>Ladies,</HI> of their respect in this
instance, that they not only entertain
all this; but permit themselves like∣wise
to be invited, and often honour
these impertinent <HI>Fantasticks,</HI> by
receiving the <HI>Ball</HI> at their Petty
<HI>Schools.</HI></P>
<P>When this Ceremony was ended,
some of the <HI>Gallants</HI> fell to other <HI>Re∣creations,</HI>
and as far as I understood,
were Offering at that Innocent, yet
Salt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Bung∣lers at <HI>A R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry.</HI></NOTE> and Pleasant diversion, which in
<HI>France</HI> is called <HI>Rallery;</HI> but so far
<PB N="29" REF="19"/>
were they from maintaining it within
the decencies, and Laws, which both
in <HI>that,</HI> and our <HI>Characters</HI> we ob∣serve
that in a little time, they fell
so upon personal abusing one ano∣ther,
that there was much ado to pre∣serve
the Peace, and as I heard, it was
the next Day, the product of a Quar∣rel,
and a <HI>Duel.</HI></P>
<P>I did frequently in the Spring, Ac∣company
My Lord <HI>N.</HI> into a Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Hide Park.</NOTE>
near the Town, which they call <HI>Hide-Park;</HI>
the place not unplesant, and
which they use, as our <HI>Course;</HI> but
not with that Order, Equipage, and
Splendor; there being an Assembly
of such wretched <HI>Jades,</HI> and <HI>Hackney-Coaches,</HI>
as quite takes away the re∣semblance.</P>
<P>The next place to be remembred
is the <HI>Spring-Garden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Spring-Garden.</NOTE> so called, and in
order to the <HI>Park,</HI> as our <HI>Thuilleries</HI>
is to the <HI>Course,</HI> the inclosure not dis∣agreeable,
for the solemness of the
<HI>Grove,</HI> the warbling of the Birds;
but the Company Walk in it at such
a rate, as you would think all the
<HI>Ladies</HI> were so many <HI>Atalanta</HI>'s, con∣tending
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
with their <HI>Wooers;</HI> and my
<HI>Lord,</HI> there was no appearance, that
I should prove the <HI>Hippomenes,</HI> who
could with very much ado, keep pace
with them: But as fast as they run;
they stay there so long, as if they
wanted not time to finish the <HI>Race;</HI>
for it is usual <HI>here</HI> to find some of the
Young Company till midnight; and
the Thickets of the <HI>Garden</HI> seem to be
contrived to all Advantages of <HI>Gallan∣try,</HI>
after they have been refreshed
with the <HI>Collation,</HI> which is here sel∣dom
omitted, at a certain <HI>Cabaret</HI> in the
middle of this <HI>Paradise;</HI> where the
forbidden Fruits are certain trifling
<HI>Tarts, Neats-Tongues, Salacious-Meats,</HI>
and bad <HI>Rhenish;</HI> for which the <HI>Gal∣lants</HI>
pay sauce, as indeed they do at
all such Houses throughout <HI>England;</HI>
for they think it is a piece of Frugali∣ty
beneath them, to Bargain, or Ac∣compt,
for what they Eat in any place,
however unreasonably imposed upon;
But thus, those mean Fellows are (as
I told your <HI>Lordship</HI>) inriched; Beg∣ger,
and insult over the <HI>Gentlemen.</HI>
I am assur'd that this particular <HI>Host.</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>
Has purchased, within few Years,
5000 <HI>Livers</HI> of annual rent; and well
he may? at the rates these <HI>Prodigials</HI>
pay, whereas, in <HI>France,</HI> a <HI>Gentle∣man</HI>
esteems it no Diminution to Ma∣nage
even these expences with Rea∣son.
But, My <HI>Lord,</HI> it is now late,
and time to quit this <HI>Garden,</HI> and to
tell you, that I think there is not a
more Illustrious sight in the World,
than to meet the <HI>Divinities</HI> of our
<HI>Court,</HI> marching up the long Walk in
the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> where the pace is so
stay'd and grave, the encounters so
regular and decent; and where those
who feed their Eyes with their Beau∣ties,
and their Ears with the Charm∣ing
<HI>Accent</HI> of their Discourse, and
Voices, need not those refreshments
of the other <HI>Senses,</HI> finding them
all to be so taken up with these.</P>
<P>I was curious before my return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where they plead as at <HI>West∣minster.</HI></NOTE> and
when I had Conquer'd some difficul∣ties
of the <HI>Language,</HI> and <HI>Customs,</HI> to
visit their Judicatures, where, be∣sides,
that few of their <HI>Gownmen,</HI>
are to be compared to those of the
<HI>Robe</HI> in our <HI>Palais</HI> for Elocution, and
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>
the talent of well speaking; so nei∣ther
do they at all exceed them, in the
forms and colours of their <HI>Pleading;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pleading amongst the Law∣yers.</NOTE> but (as before I spake of their <HI>Ralle∣ry</HI>)
supply the defects of the <HI>Cause,</HI>
with flat, insipid, and grosly abusing
one another; a thing to trifling,
and misbecoming the gravity of <HI>Courts</HI>
(where the <HI>Lawyers</HI> take Liberty to
Jest Mens Estates away, and yet
avow their Avarice) that I have
much admired at the temper of the
Judges, and their remissness in re∣forming
it: There was a Young Per∣son,
whom at my being there, was
very much cried up for his Abilities,
and in whom I did not observe that
usual intemperance, which I but now
reproved; and certainly, it springs
either for want of those Abilities,
which the <HI>Municipal</HI> Laws of this <HI>Na∣tion</HI>
(consisting most of them in <HI>Cu∣stoms</HI>
like our <HI>Normandy,</HI> whose An∣cient
<HI>Dialect</HI> their Books yet retain)
are so little apt to furnish; or the de∣fect
of those advantages, which the
more pollished <HI>Sciences</HI> afford us, with∣out
which, it is impossible to be good

Orators, and to maintain their Discour∣ses
without diversion, to that vile
nency.</P>
<P>But, what is infinitely agreeable in
this Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Bowling-Greens &amp; Races.</NOTE> are the <HI>Bowling-Greens,</HI>
and the <HI>Races,</HI> which are really such
pleasures abroad, as we have nothing
approaching them in <HI>France,</HI> and
which I was extreamly delighted in;
but the <HI>Verdure</HI> of the <HI>Country,</HI> and
delicious <HI>Downs,</HI> are what gives them
this preheminence, and indeed, they
are to be valued, and do in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> esteem,
very much commute for the loss of
that glorious <HI>Planet,</HI> which ripens our

were some Enemy in the <HI>Ariere;</HI> and

<P>But what did much more afflict me,
<PB N="34" REF="22" MS="y"/>
is their Ceremony at <HI>Table,</HI> where e∣very
Man is obliged to sit till all have
done Eating, however, their Appe∣tites
differ, and to see the formality
of the <HI>Voider,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They don't know the use of With-Drawing-Rooms.</NOTE> which our <HI>With-Draw∣ing-Rooms</HI>

<P>I have now but a Word to add,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the tediousness of <HI>Visits,</HI>
which they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>here</HI> so long, that it
is a very Tyra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, to sit to so little
purpose: If the Persons be <HI>Ladies,</HI>
that are strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Woman sometimes Silent.</NOTE> it is to look upon
each other, as if they had never seen
