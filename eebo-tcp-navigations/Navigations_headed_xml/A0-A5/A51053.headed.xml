<P>ONE of the Principal Graces which it hath pleased Almighty God to shew me, in Preser∣ving me from so many Perils and Dangers that I have run through in
<PB REF="3"/>
Travelling about the World, is this, To see my self at present at Your Majesty's Feet, offering, in all Hu∣mility and Obedience, This, my Wri∣tings, as the only Fruit which I have been able to Reap in my Long and Dangerous Travels. I know very well, that 'tis a thing which of its self is not worthy to be presented to Your Majesty. But should it please Your Majesty to consider, that the late King, Your Royal Father, of Glorious and Eternal Memory, did me formerly the Honour, to com∣mand me to undertake the most part of these Voyages, and to take pleasure in the Relations which I made to him thereof, at my Return; I dare pro∣mise my self, that Your Majesty (as you follow in all things the Generous Steps of the Greatest King, and Best Father that ever

was) will not also disdain to re∣ceive with Your wonted Goodness and Sweetness, this little Testimo∣ny of my most humble and most de∣vout Affection to Your Majesty's Ser∣vice; the which may encourage me to cause Your Majesty one Day to see (God willing) something of more Value, and to hope that, according to Your Royal Design, Your Majesty will give me Means to continue and per∣fect the <HI>Cabinet of Rarities</HI> which, by Your Command, I have began to erect in Your Majesty's Palace of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> an Enterprize so lau∣dable, that it merits to be reckoned amongst so many other Worthy Actions of Honour and Vertue, which render Your Majesty Glorious and Commen∣dable for ever: And in the mean time I will continue all the rest of my Life to pray to God,</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE, FOR THE Understanding of <HI>Circles, Zones, Parallels, Degrees</HI> of <HI>Longi∣tude,</HI> and <HI>Latitude, Climates,</HI> and other necessary Things, in the Description of the U∣niverse.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we come to a par∣ticular Recital of the Six Voyages which I have made during 14 or 15 Years in di∣vers Places of <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> I think 'twill not be much amiss (for the more clear Un∣derstanding thereof) to speak briefly, by way of Preface, something of the
<PB REF="5"/>
Four Parts of the World, and of cer∣tain Principles appertaining to the Sphere, and Geography, to the end that the Reader may the more easily apprehend such things as he shall find dispersed here and there in these my Writings; laying down for certain and necessary Maxims several things which I should otherways have been constrain'd, too often, to repeat; tho' but touching as it were upon what might be said of this Science, the more exact Research, and Knowledge of which, I leave to those who make Profession thereof, and who are more Learned therein than my self, who desire to know no more thereof than what may be necessary for me in the Narration of my Voyages.</P>
<P>Know then that God hath so dispo∣the Universe, that he hath joined the Earth and the Sea in one round Mass, whose Weight reposes in the Centre of the World, as being the lowest Place, serving for a most sure Retreat and convenient Habitation for Man and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth for Man and Beast.</NOTE> Beast, in Parts raised above the Wa∣ters, which have their limited Place
<PB REF="5"/>
in the Abysms and Depth of the Earth. Now these Waters encompass all the Earth, and separate it by an admirable Artifice into Three great and spacious Continents, or firm Lands, upon the which (according <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Con∣tinents.</NOTE> to the order and situation of the supe∣rior Parts of the World) the Cosmo∣graphers place Five principal Circles, which are the Equinoctial, the Two Tropicks of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> and the Two Polar-Circles, Artick, and Antartick. The first Circle is called Equinoctial, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Circle of the Sphere upon the Earth.</NOTE> because the Sun coming underneath the Circle, (which happens Twice in the Year, about the 21st. of <HI>March,</HI> and the 24th. of <HI>September)</HI> causes, throughout the whole World, Day and Night to be of equal length. It is equally distant from the Two Poles, and divideth the Terrestrial Globe in∣to Two Hemispheres, or equal Parts, one extending towards the North, and the other towards the South.</P>
<P>The Second Circle is the Tropick of Cancer, or Solstice of the Sum∣mer, because the Sun arriving there, causeth Summer to all the Countries on this side the Equinoctial, the which
<PB REF="6"/>
happens at such time as the Sun enters into the first degree of <HI>Cancer,</HI> which is about the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Stili no∣vi.</NOTE> 22d. of <HI>June;</HI> and then we have the longest Days, and shortest Nights in the Year. The Circle is distant from the Equator 23 Degrees and a half towards the Border of the North.</P>
<P>The Third Circle is the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> or Solstice of the Win∣ter, where the Sun arriving, which is about the 23d. of <HI>December,</HI> causeth the shortest Days and longest Nights with us; for to the other Hemisphere of the South happens the contrary. It has the same Declension of the E∣quator towards the South as the other, to wit 23 Degrees.</P>
<P>The Fourth Circle, is the Circle Artick, and the Fifth, Antartick; each of them distant from its Pole 23 Degrees and a half.</P>
<P>Now by these Four last Circles, all the Earth is divided into Five Zones, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Zones.</NOTE> or Girdles, which encompass and co∣ver the Face of the Earth, one of which is called Torrid or Burnt, two Temperate, and two Cold. The Tor∣rid is situated betwixt the Two Tro∣picks,
<PB REF="6"/>
45 Degrees in breadth; one of the Temperate, Septentrional betwixt the Tropick, and Cancer, and the Circle-Artick; the other, Meridional, betwixt the Tropick and Capricorn, and the Circle-Antartick, of 43 De∣grees each. The two Cold, are one betwixt the Circle-Artick and its Pole, and the other betwixt the Circle-An∣tartick, and its other Pole, each of 23 Degrees.</P>
<P>The Torrid Zone, thus called by the Ancients, in regard of the Opi∣nion which they had, that because of the Perpendicularity, and ordinary Neighbourhood of the Sun, all these Countries were uninhabitable, be∣cause of the excessive Heats, also that the cold Zones were so, because of the excessive Cold, caused by the great distance and lowness of this same Planet. But the Navigators of ours, and the precedent Ages, have by experience found all these Coun∣tries Habitable and Peopled; so that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Torrid Zone Inhabited.</NOTE> some of the most Wise and Learned amongst the Ancients, have left be∣hind them in their Writings more Dis∣course according to Reason and Sci∣ence,
<PB REF="7"/>
than by Experience<HI>:</HI> For in the Torrid Zone, the Heat of the Day is gently temperated by the Cold, equal with the Night; and in the cold Zones, the Air is mitigated in Sum∣mer, by reason of the long Residence of the Sun in their Horizon; besides the Cold there is rendred the less in∣supportable, in regard there being very little or no Winds, and their Blasts very feeble and weak. 'Tis true, the Countries under the cold Zones are scarcely Inhabited, because the Earth does not there fructifie as in the Temperate. But as for those of the Torrid Zone, there are vast Places wonderfully Peopled, as well for the Commodity of the Waters, as for the Goodness and Fertility of the Coun∣tries, which bear Grain, or Rice, in abundance, like the Countries subject to the King <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> towards the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope, Angoche,</HI> and the Cape of <HI>Currants,</HI> and the Country of the <HI>Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssines,</HI> or <HI>Prester-John,</HI> which extends in Land from <HI>Bombase</HI> to the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Eastern Coast you have also very spacious Islands, as those of
<PB REF="7"/>
St. <HI>Lawrance, Zealand, Maldives, Su∣matra,</HI> the <HI>Java's, Moluque's,</HI> and o∣thers without Number, extream fer∣tile, and abounding in whatsoever is delectable, and necessary for Human Life.</P>
<P>Towards the West, are the Lands of <HI>New-Spain, Brasil,</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and others adjacent, near to the Equator, which are very good. All which clearly shews the Falshood of the O∣pinions of the Ancients concerning the Habitation of these Zones.</P>
<P>Now the Extent or Breadth of these Five Zones, from the Equinoctial to each Pole, is divided into Paralells, as their length from East to West into Meridians; from whence is taken the Longitudes, and Latitudes of divers Countries.</P>
<P>The Parallels are Circles equally distant one from the other, beginning at the Equator, and finishing at the Poles. The Meridians are Circles passing through the Poles, and cros∣sing the Equator; or when the Sun is arrived, it causeth Noon to those who are above the Horizon, and Mid-night to those who are underneath.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
The Latitude of Regions is di∣stinguished by the Parallels from North to South, as the Longitude by the Me∣ridians from East to West: The Me∣ridians of equal Extent, gather toge∣ther from Two Poles; but the Paral∣lels do not so, who are always equally distant one from the other, tho' some∣times greater, or less, according to their Approach to the Equator or Poles.</P>
<P>According to the Extent of these Circles, are taken the Longitudes and Latitudes of divers Countries and Places of the Earth. The Latitude, or Hieght, is counted from the Equino∣ctial to the Poles, from one part to another, by 90 Degrees<HI>:</HI> And the Longitudes, beginning at the Meri∣dian of the Fortunate Islands, or <HI>Ca∣naries,</HI> go from West to East 360 De∣grees quite round the Earth; in which 'tis Remarkable, that the Regions un∣der the same Degree or Latitude what∣soever, have in the same moment the like *Time, as those who under divers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weather or Season.</NOTE> degrees have Diversity, and that in varying, in an Hour's time, by 15 Degrees, sooner or later, according as
<PB REF="8"/>
you are more East or West. Thus those who are under the same Degree of Latitude, tho' several of Longi∣tude, have Day and Night equally, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Days and Nights di∣vers.</NOTE> the same Seasons on the one side the Equinoctial; for on the other, 'tis quite the contrary: like as if the Winter is in the Septentrional Part, you shall have the Summer in the Me∣ridional, tho' in the same Latitude, as I have remark'd in the Kingdom of <HI>Canary,</HI> and <HI>Goa,</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> where they have their Winter in <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> contrary to the same Latitude of our <HI>Europe:</HI> But this Winter consists only in Rains, and great Winds coming from the South; and this Rain is very hot, insomuch that the Winter in these Parts of <HI>Goa,</HI> is rather hotter than our Summer here, the Trees there being continually green, and bearing Fruit in all their Seasons, as Jaquebar, Anana's, Jan∣gomes, Carambola's, Jambo's, and others; for all the Winter is hot and moist, and then the Sun seldom ap∣pears, being hid under thick Clouds, so that it renders the Days very dark. But the Places who have divers Lati∣tudes
<PB REF="9"/>
have inequality of Days and Nights, more or less, according to their difference, and approaches, or distance from the Poles: The Day be∣ginning from Sun-rising to the setting thereof.</P>
<P>In the Countries under the Equi∣noctial, they are equal with the Nights, of 22 Hours each; on the contrary, in those Places stretching towards the Poles, they lengthen as in the 30th. Degree of Latitude, the longest Day being 13 Hours 5 Minutes; un∣der the 50 Degree, 'tis 16 Hours, 20 Minutes; under the 66 and half, or in the Artick-Circle, 'tis 24 Hours intire; under the 70. the Sun sets not, during 64 Days, and 14 Hours, as in those Parts of <HI>Moscovia,</HI> as I have heard a <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain say who has been there, that their longest Day, without Night, was from <HI>June</HI> to <HI>July,</HI> as in Winter they have Night proportionably; so that it is expedi∣ent for the Ships which come from those Countries to return in the Month of <HI>August</HI> except they have a mind to be stopp'd by the Ice. The People who inhabit those Countries, make,
<PB REF="9"/>
during the Winter, little Holes in the Ice to take Sea-Wolves, tho' some∣times they are deceiv'd, and caught themselves, as I have been inform'd; so that Multitudes of People have been swallowed up, the Ice coming to break on a sudden, by reason the time or season of the Heat approaches some∣times sooner than ordinary, the which has caused these People to be more circumspect for the future.</P>
<P>'Tis also Remarkable; That the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Degrees and their Quantity.</NOTE> Degrees of Latitude are always every where equal, each Degree containing 15 <HI>German</HI> Leagues, or 17 and a half of <HI>Spanish,</HI> 25 of <HI>French,</HI> or 60 <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> Miles: But the Degrees of Lon∣gitude are equal with those of Lati∣tude, under the Equinoctial only; and the more they decline there from, they diminish, until that under the Poles they are reduced into one Point: For under the Line, the Degree of Longitude contains 60 Miles, whenas under the 60 Degree of Latitude 'tis no more than Thirty, and under the Pole nothing at all. So that it shall
<PB REF="10"/>
happen, that Two Ships being distant one from the other 150 Miles, if they sail from the Equinoctial towards the Septentrion, being arrived under the 60 Degree, they shall be no more than 75 Miles distant, and under the 71 Degree, 31 Minutes, they shall ap∣proach to Fifty, and at last under the Pole shall meet.</P>
<P>The Pilots ought well to observe this, in regard of the Currents which are found in certain Parts; so that thinking to make one way, they take another: Also I advise 'em to take heed they be not deceiv'd by certain Cards, which commonly are false, ex∣cept they have been experienc'd by good Pilots. This happen'd to us in our Voyage to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> part∣ing from the River of <HI>Cayenna,</HI> where the Caribes are, to the Isles of <HI>Santa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucia:</HI> For we were deceiv'd as well by the Currents, as the Cards we had with us, which were false, we find∣ing but one which was sure for those Parts; for instead of going to the I∣slands aforesaid, we passed along by
<PB REF="10"/>
the Isle of <HI>Tobaco,</HI> and <HI>Trinidad,</HI> and cast Anchor at the <HI>White-Island,</HI> where we could find no Water, of which we were in great want. 'Twas no small Astonishment to me, how such infi∣nite Multitudes of Cabrits, and wild Goats, (besides other Animals which are there,) could live without so much as a drop of Water: But the Divine Providence has otherways order'd it, (as I have above-touched) by the cool Nights, and the Dew, with which these Beasts refresh themselves.</P>
<P>From thence we went to <HI>Margurite</HI> Island, but we found no more Water there than we did at the other, and so to the Mouth of the River of <HI>Cu∣mana,</HI> where the People of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship had told us we should find some, as we did at the entrance of the Ri∣ver. This shews the Necessity of ha∣ving good Cards, and well rectified.</P>
<P>But to return to the Three Conti∣nents, or firm Lands, from the which all the Earth is separated by Waters: The first was by the Ancients divided into Three Parts, to wit, <HI>Europe, A∣sia,</HI>
<PB REF="11"/>
and <HI>Africa,</HI> all joining together. The second, unknown to the Anci∣ents, and discover'd in our Days by <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> in the Year 1492, and by <HI>Americus Vespusius,</HI> 1495, is <HI>America,</HI> which for its vast Extent is divided into Two Parts, <HI>Peru,</HI> and <HI>Mexico.</HI> The Third is <HI>Terra-Australis,</HI> or <HI>Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llanique,</HI> thus called, because of <HI>Ferdinand M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llan,</HI> who first found it out in the Year 1519. 'Tis suppos'd to be very great, but for the most part uninhabited and desart. 'Tis also cal∣led <HI>Terrad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go,</HI> for the great quan∣tity of Fire there seen, the which ren∣ders it infertile and uninhabited, there being several Mines of Sulphur which cause those Fires, as I saw in going to the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> for passing by the Isles of <HI>Cape-Verd,</HI> there is one of them called <HI>Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go,</HI> because of the Fire there continually seen, and is very high: One Night we sailed round a∣bout her; and seeing the Flames in great abundance coming out of the Earth in all parts, we were not a lit∣tle surpriz'd; and the next Day pas∣sing along by this same Island, with
<PB REF="11"/>
a very boisterous Wind, and approach∣ing somewhat nigh, the Wind drove the sulphurous Vapours just into our <NOTE PLACE="marg">Europe.</NOTE> Faces, which were very unsupporta∣ble and stinking.</P>
<P><HI>Europe,</HI> the first of the Three Con∣tinents, is the least in extent, and for her Fertility gives not place to the o∣thers; but for Arms, Laws, Policy, Rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion, Sciences, Arts, and all sorts of Vertues, she surpasses them by far. And of the Provinces of <HI>Europe, France</HI> alone is the Principal, accord∣ing to the Judgment of the Nations her Enemies, whether you consider the Goodness, Fertility, and Beauty of her Lands, the Excellency and tem∣perature of the Air, Salubrity, and Abundance of her Waters, and Num∣ber of Inhabitants; or in regard of the Manners of her People, their Pie∣ty, Valour, Erudition, Justice, Dis∣cipline, Liberality, Freeness, Courte∣sie, Liberty, and all other Qualities Military and Civil. In short, the Renown of the <HI>French</HI> has been such, by their Conquest in the East, that
<PB REF="12"/>
their Name remains there for an Eter∣nal Memory<HI>:</HI> So that to this Day, throughout all <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> they call all those who come from <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Franghi,</HI> let them be of what Country soever.</P>
<P>The Fertility of <HI>France</HI> is such, that she furnisheth abundantly, <HI>Spain, Por∣tugal, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Barbary,</HI> not only with Corn, but several other Com∣modities; and I verily think, that eve∣ry Year there goes from <HI>Provence, Languedoc, Bretagne, Poitou, Xain∣toign,</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> above Six thou∣sand Ships laden with Corn, and o∣ther Merchandise. To <HI>Lisbon</HI> only, there comes above a Thousand, as well great as small: And I believe that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugueses</HI> could not furnish Corn for so many Voyages, were they not supplied therewith from <HI>France</HI> to make Bis∣cuit; besides Sails, Cordage, Salt Flesh, and other necessary things to furnish their Ships.</P>
<P>The Principal Provinces of <HI>Europe,</HI> are, <HI>France, Spain, Germany</HI> High and Low, <HI>Italy, Sclavonia, Greece, Hun∣gary,</HI>
<PB REF="12"/>
<HI>Poland, Danemark, Sweden, Mus∣covy,</HI> and the Isles of <HI>England, Scot∣land, Ireland, Island, Groneland, Sici∣lia, Candia, Malta, Sardania, Corse, Corfu, Majorica, Minorica,</HI> and others of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Asia,</HI> the second Part of our first <NOTE PLACE="marg">Asia.</NOTE> Continent, is of very great Extent, Riches, and Fertility, and ever very Renowned for having born the great∣est Monarchies, and first Empires, as of the <HI>Assyrians, Babylonians, Per∣sians, Greeks, Parthians, Bactrians, Indians,</HI> and others; and at this Day, the <HI>Turks, Persians, Arabians, Tartars, Mogols, Chineses,</HI> and other <HI>Indians.</HI> But above all, this Part is the most e∣steemed, for the Creation of the first Man, planted in the Terrestrial Para∣dice, Colonies and People coming from thence, and dispersed through the rest of the World, and moreover, for the Redemption of Mankind, and the Operation of our Salvation acted therein; besides, for having given Religion, Science, Arts, Laws, Poli∣cy, Arms, and Artifices, to all the o∣ther
<PB REF="13"/>

<P>The last Part of this first Conti∣nent is <HI>Africa,</HI> separated from <HI>Europe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Africa.</NOTE> by the Mediterranean-Sea, and from <HI>Asia,</HI> by the Isthmus of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> making as it were a Pe∣ninsula, encompass'd on all sides by the Sea, save by this Neck of Land, which is betwixt <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Palestine.</HI> Its principal Provinces are <HI>Egypt, Bar∣bary, Fez,</HI> and <HI>Morocco, Aethiopia,</HI> or <HI>Abyssine, Nubia, Lybia, Guinia, Con∣go, Monomotapa,</HI> and others of the South: This Part is very good and
<PB REF="13"/>
fertile in some Places; but it contains several great and sandy Desarts with∣out Water.</P>
<P>That part of <HI>Africa,</HI> unknown to the Ancients, and discover'd by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> about the Year 1497. is called by the <HI>Arabians, Zanzibar,</HI> and extends from the Lakes where the <HI>Nile</HI> takes its Original, to the Cape of <HI>Good-hope,</HI> containing several good Countries bordering upon <HI>Monomota∣pa,</HI> as amongst others, <HI>Cefala,</HI> and <HI>Cuama,</HI> from whence is gotten great quantity of fine Gold; insomuch that it has been the Opinion of several, That those Countries of <HI>Cefala,</HI> and <HI>Cnama,</HI> was the <HI>Ophir</HI> where <HI>Solomon</HI> sent to fetch Gold; tho' others think 'twas rather <HI>Malaca,</HI> and other Places of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and some will have it to be <HI>Peru</HI> in the <HI>West.</HI></P>
<P>The last Continent of the World is that Part which we call <HI>America,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">America.</NOTE> and which, as I have said, is divided into Two Principal Parts, <HI>Mexico</HI> in the North, and <HI>Peru</HI> in the South, separated by the Isthmus of <HI>Banama:</HI>
<PB REF="14"/>
There are several Provinces, and Peo∣ple of different Languages, Manners, and Fashions. The greatest City in those Northern Parts, is <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>Temistitan,</HI> opulent in Riches, and all manner of Delights. Before she was subject to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> she contain'd (as they say) above 70000 Houses, with an exceeding great and glorious Temple, where they sacrificed Men, Women, and Children, of all Ages and Sex, to their Idols, in cleaving them down the Breast, and plucking out their Hearts whilst they were beating, which they cast into the Fa∣ces of these Idols; and sometimes they thus open'd Women with Child, but especially Virgins, tho' how beau∣tiful soever, were not exempt, and whom they used in a most shameful manner, in exposing that which Na∣ture hath hid from the Eyes of all the World<HI>:</HI> For this their great Cruelty, and horrible Tyranny, they acquir'd a very bad Name amongst the People their Neighbours, who would never become their Friends, but by Force; and what was the most strange, they
<PB REF="14"/>
spared not their nearest Kindred for these abominable Sacrifices; and when any Man of Authority came to die, they interred with him their Slaves alive, to bear him Company in the o∣ther World: When they had offer'd in Sacrifice their Enemies, they cut the Bodies into pieces, and then roast them, to feast with their Friends there∣with. The <HI>Caribes,</HI> another People towards the South, do the same of which we will speak in its proper place.</P>
<P><HI>Ferdinand Cortez,</HI> who conquer'd <HI>Mexico,</HI> had no small Trouble to make them quit this abominable Custom; also the Hatred which their Neigh∣bours bore them, was cause of their total Destruction: For they rais'd such great Numbers for the Assistance of <HI>Cortez,</HI> that at last, by their Help, (after a great Slaughter of 'em,) he got the Victory, and took their City, to the extream Joy and Contentment of these neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI> their ever sworn Enemies.</P>
<P>The Septentrional, or North Part of <HI>America,</HI> comprehends the Coun∣tries <NOTE PLACE="marg">America.</NOTE>
<PB REF="15"/>
of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>New-Spain, Flo∣rida, Virginia, Canada, New France, Estotiland,</HI> the Countries of <HI>Labrad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> and <HI>Cortereal,</HI> and several other Coun∣tries towards the North, to the Straights of <HI>Anian,</HI> who are not yet discover'd.</P>
<P>Towards the North of <HI>New Spain,</HI> were several Countries discover'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the Year 1583. as the Land of <HI>Conquas, Passaguates, Ti∣quas, Toboses, Jumans, Quires, Pat∣tarabives, Cumanes, Quivora,</HI> and o∣thers.</P>
<P>The Meridional, or South Part of <HI>America,</HI> contains several Provinces, as <HI>Peru, Chile, Los Patagons, Bra∣zile, Cariabane, Cumana, Dariena, Ʋraba, Cast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llia d'Oro, New-Granadae,</HI> and others; besides the Isles, as well in the North Sea, as <HI>Cuba, Hispanio∣la,</HI> and others, as those in he South-Sea, of <HI>Solomon,</HI> and others un∣known.</P>
<P><HI>Brazil</HI> has for Limits towards the North the great River of the <HI>Ama∣zons,</HI> and towards the South, <HI>Rio di la Plat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or the River of Silver. This
<PB REF="15"/>
Country is very pleasant and agreea∣ble, with a good Air and temperate, for the most part hot and moist, a∣bounding in several sorts of wild Fruits, and in Raisins, Potato's, and Cassaves, of which the Inhabitants live. There are a great Number of terrestrial and watry Animals, which feed upon these Fruits, and Serpents <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wonderful Serpents.</NOTE> of such a strange and monstrous sort, that the colour of the Skin only is e∣nough to cause Horror and Amaze∣ment. They frequently eat the Ar∣madilla, which is a Creature armed with a Coat, as also the Crocodile, and Gouana's, which is a sort of a Lizard with very long Feet. The Flesh of these are savoury enough, tho' sweet∣ish and insipid.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Brazil</HI> are great Ene∣mies <NOTE PLACE="marg">Brazilians <HI>great Ene∣mies to the</HI> Portu∣guese.</NOTE> to the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> and when they can catch any of 'em, they eat them without Intermission; and what is most admirable, they know how to find out by the sandy and dirty Ways, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> above all other Nations whatsoever, and can discover them by
<PB REF="16"/>
their Tract, like as the Hunts-man does the wild Beasts.</P>
<P>They once took a <HI>Portugal</HI> Woman, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Miserable End of a young Wo∣man.</NOTE> young, and very beautiful, whom the <HI>French,</HI> who were there, could not save from being eaten, and which was done in a strange manner; for assem∣bling a Company of them together, in a Ring, in the midst of whom was set this poor young Woman, then ha∣ving stript her stark naked, not at all regarding her Modesty, they viewed her from Head to Foot; and after ha∣ving well consider'd her Delineaments, some commending one thing, and some another, they fell to howling and yelling like so many Devils; whereupon immediately, like a Com∣pany of hunger-starv'd Dogs, they fell upon this poor innocent Creature, and in less than two Minutes tore her into above a Thousand pieces, which they as suddenly swallow'd down. They are very Vindictive, never par∣doning, but by force, and not of Good∣will. When the <HI>French</HI> arrive there, they give them their Daughters to lie
<PB REF="16"/>
withal, hoping they will give them something at their Departure.</P>
<P>The Third Continent is <HI>Terra-Au∣stralis,</HI> not yet discover'd, which is otherwise call'd the <HI>Land of Fire,</HI> of <HI>Parrots,</HI> and <HI>New Guiney.</HI> There, towards the calm Sea, and the Archi∣pelago of St. <HI>Lazarus,</HI> are the Isles of <HI>Solomon,</HI> not yet fully discover'd.</P>
<P>Some Years since, a <HI>Portugal</HI> Cap∣tain, named <HI>Pedro Fernandes di Quie∣ros,</HI> sailed round some Parts thereof, and tells Wonders of those Countries, how that they abound in Beauty and Goodness; insomuch that they resem∣ble an Earthly Paradise. But we ought to wait for a more certain and ample Discovery. The Geographers, and <HI>Portugal</HI> Pilots tell us, That these Countries of <HI>Terra-Australis</HI> are great∣er than <HI>Europe,</HI> and part of <HI>Asia.</HI> This Captain <HI>Pedro-Fernandes,</HI> found out there the Bays of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> and St. <HI>James,</HI> and the Port of <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> which, as they say, is capable of a∣bove a Thousand Ships, in the Alti∣tude of Fifteen Degrees and a half.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P>ACcording to the desire I had, of a Long time, to Travel about the World, I had a mind to begin with <HI>Africa,</HI> ha∣ving occasionally found a Ship bound for <HI>Lybia▪</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="57"/>
I parted then from St. <HI>Malo</HI> the 9th <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parting from St.</HI> Malo 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. <HI>Encounter with a Ship.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>October,</HI> 1601. and embarqued in the Ship called the <HI>Serene,</HI> Laden with <HI>Salt,</HI> and very well furnished with Victuals, and munition of War; we were 25. men in all, and having born to the <HI>S-West,</HI> and the wind being very favourable, we passed the <HI>Cape</HI> of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> and being come up within view of the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands we met with a Ship and a <HI>Patache,</HI> whom we descried a far off, using their utmost to come up to us, the <HI>Patache</HI> came with a Light-wind to view us nearer, and to know who we were; but they were not so ill-advised as to come within the reach of our Cannon. At last after having viewed us well on all sides, and taking notice of the Port, and fashion of our Ship, they returned toward their Admiral, who was about 3 or 4. Leagues off us, telling him that our vessel was not so great as theirs; yet they did not know what sort of peo∣ple we were, not having spoken with us. Their Admiral hearing this, sent them again with the <HI>Patache</HI> to watch us all night, with, a Lanthorn
<PB N="3" REF="57"/>
upon the Mast, coasting us continually a good way off. But we, seeing our selves so close pursued by these Pirate Ships, broke our boat to make plat-forms, so that we might change our Cannon from one side to the o∣ther; then having fitted our Net-deck, and made ready our Musquets, with our Cannons and Patterero's, and hoisted our Sails, with provision of wine upon the Deck, for the Sea-men to drink, to make them the more Couragious; we were resolved all to die, rather than suffer our selves to be taken by these <HI>Corsairs.</HI> Thus having been round about us for two days and two nights, at last their Admiral arriving with all his top-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ails, full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail, he commanded us to vield; but we being deaf to that, and ready to let fly our whole broad∣side; he cried out aloud that we should not fire if we were wise, and that if we were a <HI>French</HI> Ship he would do us no harm, and that we should only put out our boat; we made answer that our boat was broke, and he might put out his if he would; upon which he was a long
<PB N="4" REF="58"/>
time disputing the matter: But at last seeing us so resolute, and so well co∣ver'd with our net-deck, he put out his Boat, and came aboard us, and seeing nothing but <HI>Salt</HI> in our ship, he re∣turned again without doing us any harm for so smal a matter, besides seeing us so resolved to defend our selves to the last man, and that there was nothing to be gotten but blows, he left us. From thence we pursued our course: But upon our return, meeting with us again, he beat us soundly, and did us a great deal of damage, having three or four ships to our one.</P>
<P>The 6th of <HI>November</HI> we perceived <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> a Ship, and a <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id behind <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> making ful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail towards us<HI>:</HI> But we, seeing ourselves so near being surprised about four or five a clock in the afternoon, we Tack'd from him that we might have time to prepare our selves: But be∣fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could run out our Cannon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> our Net-deck, they came up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>▪ and commanded us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they would sink us; upon which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Captain (not at all af∣frighted

<P>The next morning we entred into the Haven, where we sound three <HI>Lybian-Moors</HI> on shore, who had run <NOTE PLACE="marg">Moors of Lybia.</NOTE> away from the people of these seven Ships, they not being able to catch them again in these deserts. These three <HI>Moors</HI> came freely enough on board our Ship, knowing again our Captain▪ who had formerly travelled into these parts: They told us that there was a <HI>Portugal</HI> Pinnace hard by <HI>Cape-veille,</HI> on the other side <HI>Cape-blane;</HI> upon which our Captain <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pe▪veille</NOTE> was resolved to find them out by Land, which he did with a great

<P>As for the rest, the <HI>Ostriches</HI> (which are there in abundance,) Lay their eggs in the sand, and there they bury them; so that it is a very hard matter to find them out, but when the wind blows, they are discovered.

Three days after, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being An∣chored round about us, at their case, they command us to depart out of the Haven, telling us that it was not <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> permitted to the <HI>French</HI> to take any Fish there; the which we were for∣ced
<PB N="12" REF="62"/>
to do, and took a <HI>Moor</HI> along with us to guide our Ship to <HI>Cape-veille.</HI> This <HI>Moor</HI> was called <HI>Hisse,</HI> one who very well knew this Coast, we not being far from the Fort of <HI>Arguin,</HI> where there were <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acks.</HI> We found this place very good for Fish, and having staid there for some time, a <HI>Spaniard</HI> com∣ing from the Fort of <HI>Arguin</HI> came towards us, desiring us to give him some Nails, and wood which they had occasion for, for their Ship, which was in the <HI>Cape</HI> from whence we were come. We gave him what he ask't; but this Traitor, came on∣ly to spy us, and to know what we were doing, and if we had our La∣ding, saying that they found no Fish in their Haven, and that they should be forced to come and seek it on our side: And all this to deceive us, as they did.</P>
<P>For about three, or four days after <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Treachery of the</HI> Spiniards.</NOTE> they came with three boats to force us, and they made use of this trick; that is, they put their Nets into their Boats, and hid their Arms under neath, then seeing that all our men
<PB N="13" REF="62"/>
were on Shore busie about the Fish, they sent two of their boats to take our men, and the other came on board our Ship as friends, and their Arms being hid we suspected nothing; we being but three on board, the Captain, the Carpenter, and my self▪ with one <HI>Black.</HI> The Captain commanded me to make ready a Collation for them; but they saved me that labour, by seising upon our Captain, and the Room where the Arms were. One of the Duke's Ship-boy's taking a na∣ked▪sword in his hand, set himself a∣gainst the Cabine-door, to hinder any of us from entering, then they weighed the Anchors, and set Sail, and made towards the <HI>Mole,</HI> where their Ships were: Being arrived there, they took away all our Arms, our Pouder, and our Sails; then putting again all our men into our Ship, to com∣pleat the Lading of Fish, they kept good watch all the night, continu∣ally mistrusting us.</P>
<P>But <HI>Christmas</HI> being come, which was almost the time to depart from hence, to return with the Fish, against Lent. They took all our men out of
<PB N="14" REF="63"/>
our Ship, and put them in theirs, placing <HI>Spaniards</HI> in ours, leaving some of our men there, to help about the Fish. Of three Ships that re∣mained there, two set Sail, and ours made the third, to return into <HI>Spain▪</HI> But being in the open Sea, holding the Master of our Ship in theirs they gave the command to the <HI>Spanish-</HI>Captain, which was in ours, and the Duke's Cabin-boy being left there for Master<HI>:</HI> the others then held their Course, and left us alone: But being about <HI>Porto-Santo</HI> near to the Isle <NOTE PLACE="marg">Port-Santo, or Holy Ile. Madera.</NOTE> of <HI>Madera,</HI> we were beaten with contrary winds in so much that we were forced to make towards the Isle, where having cast An∣chor a good way off from the City of <HI>Madera,</HI> we had a mind to go on Shore to refresh our selves: But the <HI>Portuguese</HI> that lived there would not suffer us, saying we had the Plague, and therefore set Guards at all the Avenues. In so much that we were forced to get down behind the Rocks, where we had bread, and wine brought us for our money, which was from a wall let down to
<PB N="15" REF="63"/>
us with a rope, yet not without great intreaty.</P>
<P>We remained Fifteen days in this misery, at the end of which the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships our companions▪ which we had left in the Sea, Arrived in the said Isle with their Main-mast cut down by reason of the bad wea∣ther. And their General of the Ship made such a doe, by words, and re∣monstrances, that he obtained leave to enter into <HI>Madera;</HI> upon condition to take the habit of the City of <HI>Madera,</HI> he, and his servants; a little after, this General being somewhat indisposed, sent to seek me out in this place, where we were in Custody and took the habit of the City, after the <HI>Spanish</HI> fashion, which one of the Souldiers of the Castle had lent me; and so I entered <HI>Madera</HI> to visit this General, where I tarried untill the time of our Embarquement.</P>
<P>Whilest I was visited, and stripped by these people of the Gard-maor in changing my habit, I had forgotten my Purse, which I left in my pocket; But these Gallants had remembred to handle it, and took out the most part
<PB N="16" REF="64"/>
of my money for me, before I per∣ceived it, and had I not retur∣ned presently again to see after it, they had not left me so much as a blanck.</P>
<P>Now one night, as we were all <NOTE PLACE="marg">Design to save them∣selves.</NOTE> with-drawn into our Ship, except the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, and the Pilote, our Captain took a resolution with Six of his men who were there to play the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a fine trick, before the Master, and Pilote came on board, and the Captain's Mate was ordered to lead the others to the bottom of the Ship, promising to make them drink some good wine, to which the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mariners, (who are always ready for their share of such a game, when they can have it on free▪cost) would not have fail∣ed. We had also disposed our other men in order, some to Guard the Chamber of the Poop, where the Arms were, where I was appointed with one of our men, who had but one Leg, having lost the other in the last Fight: others to set Sail with the wind<HI>:</HI> And the more to facili∣tate our design, we weighed one
<PB N="17" REF="64"/>
Anchor, leaving the other <HI>a pique.</HI> But no so sooner had we made an end of weighing Anchor, than pre∣sently came the Captain, and the Pilote, with the other <HI>Spanish</HI> Mari∣ners on board. The Pilot was woun∣ded by a blow with a sword, hav∣ing on Shore fought a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of one of the other Ships. Thier Ar∣rival quite spoiled our design, and the next day the wind being good we set Sail.</P>
<P>As for the rest, this Ile of <HI>Madera,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A descrip∣tion of the Isle and City of</HI> Madera,</NOTE> one of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> or fortunate of the Ancients, may have about Fourty Leagues in compass, and hath two Cities, of which the principal is also called <HI>Madera,</HI> with two Fortresses, in one of which, and the strongest, there are <HI>Castilian</HI> Soulders, and in the other <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>The City is seated in a Valley, and at the foot of a Mountain, from whence comes so much water, and sometimes in such abundance, that very often it causes inundations, which do much damage, carrying a∣way Bridges, Houses, Churches, and other edifices. The City is about
<PB N="18" REF="65"/>
as big as St. <HI>Denis,</HI> but very popu∣lous, having a great number of slaves, who work upon the sugar without the City; and about all the rest of the Island, stand here and there May-houses of pleasure. The soil is very plentiful in all sorts of excellent fruits, and especially in Wines: The Air there is very sweet and tempe∣rate, and the pleasantest place in the World to live in; And 'tis no won∣der if the Ancients esteemed this coun∣try to be the <HI>Elisian fields,</HI> and as an earthly Paradice.</P>
<P>Amongst the rest the Earth there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sugar∣canes.</NOTE> produces a great quantity of Sugar∣canes very spungie which they of the country cut, and bruise in a Mill, then putting it into the Press, and the Liquor, squeesed out, is put to the fire where 'tis boiled over and over in vessels like those which the Dyers use, so that all the moisture may be wholly consumed; and so having refined it, they clap it into <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sugar-loaves.</NOTE> Earthen-moulds, where it is formed into Sugar-loaves, as 'tis brought us▪ The substance, or husk that re∣mains is a redish, and blackish sugar,
<PB N="19" REF="65"/>
which they call Meleche, that is to say black.</P>
<P>I saw there the <HI>French</HI> Consul, Named <HI>Jean de Chux,</HI> who had mar∣ried the Niece of <HI>Don Christoval de More,</HI> Vice Roy of <HI>Portugal:</HI> He is very rich, and curteous, and did me and my companions a great deal of favour: There are always a great ma∣ny Factors; as <HI>French English Dutch,</HI> and others, who are to Load the Ships that trade there, They make there a great quantity of excellent sweet meats, that are carried from thence as <HI>Marmelades, quidnies,</HI> Can∣did Lemmon, and several other cu∣rious Pastes.</P>
<P>But to return again to our depar∣ture; we were not gotten Thirty Leagues from the Ile, when we were overtaken with such a great tempest, that we were forced to return back to <HI>Madera,</HI> which was the Twenty fifth of <HI>January,</HI> 1602. and did not go out again till the Ninth of <HI>February,</HI> and made such hast, that we Arrived at St. <HI>Lucar de Baramede</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> where being come, our Captain was presently made Prisoner in the <HI>Real</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="66"/>
<HI>des Galleres,</HI> saying for these Reasons, that in some of the former Voyages he had sold Corn, and Arms to the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> at <HI>Cap-blane;</HI> up∣on which they brought informations with the deposition of the <HI>Moors;</HI> The <HI>Adelandate</HI> (not being willing to give Credit to the <HI>Moors)</HI> Let go our Captain with his Ship, but our Fish was all spoiled, which was a great Loss to us. We went from thence to <HI>Lisbon</HI> to sell it, where only we sold part of it, but the Visitor of health being come on board our Ship, and finding it bad, commanded us to sell no more of it upon great penalty, so that we were forced to cast the rest into the Sea.</P>
<P>About this time our Captain found <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges to</HI> Mazag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</NOTE> an opportunity to Fraight his Ship to go to <HI>Mazagan</HI> in <HI>Afrique,</HI> to carry Corn, and biscquet to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Souldiers who are there in Garison to make war in <HI>Barbary.</HI> With this Lading we parted from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> the Twenty third of <HI>April,</HI> the next day after <HI>Easter,</HI> and that in all di∣ligence to go succour these Poor peo∣ple, who were ready to die with
<PB N="21" REF="66"/>
hunger; There had been before se∣veral Ships sent with Victuals but had been taken by the Pirates. Being Arrived there, we fired a Cannon to give them notice, to send us a Pilot to come nearer; they answered us with another shot, and sent the said Pilot; we approached as near as we possibly could, and cast Anchor about three or four Leagues from <HI>Mazagan,</HI> with that a great number of boats came on board to unlade us. It was a great pity to see these poor people <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great hun∣ger of the</HI> Spaniard.</NOTE> how they were starved, and if these Victuals had not come so seasonably as they did, I believe they had been either dead, or otherways had been forced to have yielded themselves slaves to the <HI>Barbarous-moors.</HI> I could not hinder the children, nor the great ones themselves, from boring holes in the sacks where the biscquet were that they might eat, or rather allay their hunger. I did my utmost endea∣vour to keep them away, tho' I was very sorry to see them so faint, and look so dreadfully with hunger. My Captain had given me the charge of the biscquet, for to return him the same
<PB N="22" REF="67"/>
weight that he had delivered to me at <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P>This being all unladed and put in∣to the Magazines for that purpose, I saw the Gentlemen and Cavalliers coming to look every one for his weight of Biscuit, and measure of Corn, which is ordinarily allowed them by the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> One of these Cavalliers re∣ceived and lodged me in his House; for there is no Inn nor resting place for Strangers.</P>
<P>I ordered the Business so, that our Captain and Master were lodged there also, causing Beds to be prepared for them to lie in.</P>
<P>As for me, I received a thousand Courtesies from this Cavallier, whom I cured of an Humour he had in his Eyes, which he finding remov'd, knew not how to treat me. For in this place was neither Physician nor Apothecary, but only one Surgeon, who was very well sk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll'd in the Latin Tongue, but wanted the knowledge of Medicines, and Experience.</P>
<P>The Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igidor, or Judge of this place, invited me one day to Dine with this Surgeon, who discoursed
<PB N="23" REF="67"/>
very readily in Latin; yet for all that he could not give Ease to a Patient that he had.</P>
<P>The most part of the People of the City came to ask for me at my Lodg∣ing to give them Physick, and made me great Offers; But I had not leisure to give Satisfaction to all; forasmuch as we were to return in a short time, as we did not long after.</P>
<P>As for the rest, this City of <HI>Maza∣gan</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mazagan <HI>described.</HI></NOTE> is very strong, and the Walls so thick, that six Cavalliers may walk a∣breast round about 'em: The Houses there are very low, and over-topped by the Walls. There is a great ma∣ny Cannon, very large and long, and line almost all the Wall, but ill moun∣ted: There may be about forty Can∣noniers, with some 600 Soldiers, <HI>viz.</HI> 200 Horse, and 400 Foot, the most part Married. They make Incursions upon the Arabians, whom they take Prisoners, and drive away their Cattle. They have hard by them a City called <HI>Azamor,</HI> which makes hot War upon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> them, and not above two Leagues one from the other. Every morning there goes out 40 Horse to discover what
<PB N="24" REF="68"/>
they can see, and tarry out till noon: In the afternoon 40 others go out, who stay till night: And there are about six of these Cavalliers whom they call <HI>Atalayes,</HI> that is to say, the Watch, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Atalayes.</NOTE> who are far distant one from the o∣ther, and keep Centinel every where; and when they discover any thing, they Post back; and then the City Watch, who sees them, strikes 2 or 3 blows upon a Bell; with that, the others presently mount their Horses, and run to the place of the signal. For in every place where these <HI>Ata∣layes</HI> are, there is a long Pole, like a Mast; and when they perceive any thing, they with a little Cord heave their sign on high, which is the signal to all those who Salley out of <HI>Maza∣gan.</HI> When they have a mind to make an Incursion, every one arms himself, each of 'em carrying Forage for their Horses, whom they give Corn to, out of the Allowance, and Pension, which is sent them from <HI>Por∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></P>
<P>They Eat there abundance of <HI>Cari∣cols,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carical<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> which are little Snails in Shells, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d upon the Plants; and there
<PB N="25" REF="68"/>
the Plants are of an exceeding force and virtue.</P>
<P>The Bees there make White <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Honey of</HI> Africa.</NOTE> Honey, and of an excellent Taste: Their Hives are upon the Houses, which after the African manner are covered with Sotees, like to Cieling after the Moresque; and one may ea∣sily go from one House to another.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Mazagan</HI> is nothing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Country of</HI> Mazagan.</NOTE> else but a Fortress, being about half a League in compass; and is inhabited by none but Men of War, who have every one their piece of Land round about the City, where they Sow Corn, as Barley, Pease, Beans, and other G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ains; but very often the Moors <NOTE PLACE="marg">Villanies of the Moors.</NOTE> come and cut it up in the night time, and spoil it. The rest of the Country is Uncultivated.</P>
<P>The Moors do them a thousand In∣juries, even to Poisoning a Well, which they have out of the City in a Garden, by casting in Carrion, with other filth and nastiness.</P>
<P>Within the City there is a full Cistern; and upon the <HI>Ciloe</HI>'s Festival-Day, the watch is set: It is very high and large, and is capable of holding a∣bove 20000 Pipes of Water.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="69"/>
I was near being left to tarry in this City. For the day before we were to set sail, our Captain and the Ma∣ster came ashore for me; for I never budged from the City, minding no∣thing else but the Cure of these People. Now, as I was gone to walk along by the Sea-side, to gather some Sea▪Crist, which is there in abundance, being returned to the City to take my rest▪ I was sent for in great haste to go see a Patient, upon which our Cap∣tain went away, and left me there all alone▪ Knowing this, I went pre∣sently▪towards the Sea-shore, but he was already far▪enough from thence▪ so I was forced to go back again to the City to wait till the next day▪ In the mean time the Ship finding the Wind good, set Sail; and a Soldier, who was a Centinel upon the Wall, knowing that I was still in the City▪ came presently to give me notice thereof; At which all astonished I run presently to the Wall to see if it was true, and being in great perplex∣ity how to get out from thence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> went to the Captain of the Foot Sol∣diers to desire him to cause the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="27" REF="69"/>
to be opened, which he did, and gave the Key to the Porter; but I must stay till the Cavalliers were ready to go out: This time seemed to me an Age. At last the Gate being opened, I de∣sired the Pilot-Moor to get me a Boat ready, to carry me on Board our Ship; and by good fortune I found some Soldiers who were going a Fishing, one of whom had brought us from <HI>Portugal.</HI> They did me that favour as to take me into their Boat: Had we wanted that little Wind, which was weak enough, I had been forced to have tarried there; for which I should not have been much perplexed, had I but had my Cloaths, my Medi∣cines, and my other Things; but I had unhappily been in my Doublet, without comfort, or any other thing. These Soldiers then did their utmost to overtake the Ship, which was al∣ready got far off, besides the Sea be∣gan to rise, insomuch that these Men would not go any further, telling, that if the Wind should rise but never so little, they should not be able to recover Land by their utmost Efforts, but run the risque of their Lives▪
<PB N="28" REF="70"/>
Hereupon they left of Rowing, and and held Council amongst themselves what was best to be done; and ha∣ving resolved to return, they began again to handle their Oars; upon which, I being much vexed, endea∣vour'd to urge them by Prayers and Promises, that I would certainly Con∣tent them, to return again towards the Ship; and by strength of Oars we made our way so that we arrived there. This was no small fortune for me, considering in what trouble they live in there; Besides, the most part of the Portuguese there are such People who are carried thither by Force, being Condemned to be there for a certain time to make War upon the Moors; In short, they are almost all Criminals, otherwise none would be forced to go there.</P>
<P>Having then happily overtaken our Ship, our Captain for excuse, let me understand, that he could not possibly wait any longer for me than until it was day, and if I had not been on Shore, he had set sail the same night, knowing well that when I saw them under Sail I would hast to overtake
<PB N="29" REF="70"/>
them. But I believe the reason that moved him to go away so hastily without me, was rather to Cheat me of some Money he owed me, and which he payed me since, against his Will, telling me of his Losses; but I was not bound to participate in them, forasmuch as the Condition that I made with him was neither for Gain nor Loss. But I could not get any thing of him since then, but by an Arrest of the Parliament of <HI>Britagne</HI> in the year 1603.</P>
<P>At last we arrived at <HI>St. Lucar de Baramede</HI> the 26th of <HI>May,</HI> and being <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Return to</HI> Africa.</NOTE> laden with Salt in the River of <HI>Seville,</HI> near the Salt▪Houses, which are there along the Coast, with some Scutchen∣eal, such as Scarlet is Dyed withall, and about 30000 Crowns in silver, we set sail the first of <HI>July</HI> 1692. ac∣companied with a little Flemish Ship. The 15th of the same month we des∣cried two great Ships, with their Pataches, making full Sail upon us, and we prepared our selves presently to receive them, ordering our Net-Decks, and running out our Guns, in number 12, with our Pattereroes and
<PB N="30" REF="71"/>
Muskets; then hoisting our Sails, and handling our Yards, we waited for them in so ready a posture. It was not long before they were upon us, commanding us to yield, and low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea Fight.</NOTE> our Sails, and began to Salute us, each with a Broadside; in the mean time we answering them in the same Language: The Fight continued so all the day, without gaining the least advantage one upon the other: We had a great many Men wounded and burnt with the Fire that was kindled by some shots of Cannon; and be∣sides, one of the great Guns burst into pieces, and the Breech of it broke through the two Decks, fell amongst the Salt, and had it not been for the resistance that it found there, it had broke quite through our Ship. In the mean time the small Shot rained upon us like Hail, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fight.</NOTE> without ceasing, insomuch that our Ship was pierced through and through on e∣very side, and our Sails torn to pieces, and all the rest in bad Equipage; but the night coming on, the Fight ceased, and our Enemies watched us all until the next morning, then they left us at
<PB N="31" REF="71"/>
liberty. All the night we were con∣sulting what we had best to do, whe∣ther to yield, or to defend our selves to the utmost extremity. Our Cap∣tain, who was of a great Courage, would not hearken to yielding: Here∣upon we went on Board the Flemish-Ship to know their pleasure. This Flemish Ship at the first discharge of her Cannon, had burnt all her Powder, with which a great number of her Men were disabled and destroyed. They had put their Powder in a piece of Sail, and a Match by chance touched <NOTE PLACE="marg">Accident of Powder.</NOTE> it, which was the cause of this Disa∣ster. I went on Board their Ship to see their Pilot, who was quite Roasted, his Belly, Face, and Hands, mighty big and swoln; I brought him some Remedies. I was told that there was 4 or 5 others in a very bad condition, and ready to die: They were Burnt after a pitious and horrible manner. In the end, after we had well con∣sulted with them, it was resolved to send a Boat on Board the Enemies, with a Man that understood their Language, for they were English; which was done accordingly: But
<PB N="32" REF="72"/>
they would be pacified by no means whatsoever, saying, that they had suffered a great deal of loss, and that it was not their intention to do any harm to the French, that being ex∣presly forbidden them by the Queen their Mistress: But that our Captain had given them ill Language, and that he himself must come on Board them to excuse himself, which was done; And they came on Board us, with the Boats of their two Ships, searching in every corner, but they found nothing but Salt: If they had met with our Money, we should have been in a bad condition; for they had played us a trick of their Trade. At last, after we had made them some Presents of Victuals, they withdrew themselves. Their Mariners and Sol∣diers told us that they had resolved to have fallen▪ upon us in the morn∣ing; and had Drank to one another, and Eaten all the little Refreshment they had, hoping to have more of us; but God by his Mercy delivered us from them.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="72"/>
<HI>Note,</HI> That one of these two Ships by whom we were so beaten, was the same that we met withall at the first, and who had so Chased us in going to <HI>Cape-blane:</HI> We having then made him good chear, which was no small help to us at this time; and he told us, that after he had left us, he took a Ship laden with Sugar, which paid him well for the trouble we had given him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, being delivered <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Return to</HI> France.</NOTE> from this danger, we made such haste that we came near to the Cape <HI>de Fi∣nibus Terrae:</HI> On this side of the Cape we found a German Ship of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> very great, and put out our Boat to go on board her, that we might have a little Biscquet, for ours began to grow very short, because of the contrary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Weather.</NOTE> Winds. We had some of them for our Money, and they were very honest Men<HI>:</HI> I went also in the Boat to have some Refreshments; but the Wind being high, the Sea began to rise, and the fore part of our Boat was broke, drawing so much Water that we could find no way to empty it; and the German Ship was already a League and a half off us▪ but they made a little
<PB N="34" REF="73"/>
towards us, seeing us in the Sea: We had much ado to get into her, and I to find hold betwixt the Boat and the Ship, because the Sea was very high; but taking the end of a Rope, I was very nimble in mounting up, and had only one Leg a little bruised.</P>
<P>At last, we arrived at <HI>St. Malo</HI> the first of <HI>August:</HI> The next day our Ship <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arriving at</HI> St. Malo.</NOTE> was likely to have been lost in the Road, by a great Storm that came so <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great dan∣ger at An-charing.</NOTE> unlooked for, that we had much ado to make the Men go on board, or otherways the Vessel had sunk at An∣chor; And so this troublesome Voyage was finished, for which God be Praised.</P>

<P>AFter my return from <HI>Africa,</HI> I continued for sometime in <HI>France,</HI> and knowing that the Sieur <HI>de la Ra∣vardiere</HI> was going away for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="76"/>
I had a wonderful desire to see those Countries: And for this cause I <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Embarking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the</HI> VVest-In∣dies.</NOTE> entered my self with the <HI>Sieur,</HI> and embarked in his Ship in the Haven of <HI>Concale</HI> the 12th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1604. We went to <HI>Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> (which is an Isle five Leagues from <HI>Concale)</HI> there to wait for weather for us to put to Sea. We tarried there till the 24th of the same month, not without having suffered by great Winds; which gave us no small trouble, besides the loss of our Boat; but we soon bought another, and at last set Sail, bearing South East, and in a little time▪ we passed the Channel. And forasmuch as our Ship was new, not having as yet been pro∣ved in the Sea, we were forced to suffer her to take her Course; not be∣ing able to bear up Sails; for she veer'd after such a manner, (her Top-Mast being high) that she was continually with one side upon the Water, which was a great inconvenience: Never∣theless, putting our trust in God, we proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded on; and at the height of the Cape <HI>de Finibus Terrae,</HI> we found a Ship, and made full sail upon her to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> know what she was. Coming close
<PB N="41" REF="76"/>
up to, and being prepared to attack her, and they also provided to receive us, we found out that it was a French Ship, the Captain of which came up∣on the Poop well armed, with his Sword in his Hand, crying out to us to Steer Leeward, or else he would fire at us; but we contesting a little thereupon, that we might find out and know of what part of <HI>France</HI> he might be: After having well considered him and known him for a right French Man, we came up Leewards of him, of which he was not a little Proud, thinking that we had been a Man of War, and durst not assault him; for he made signs with his Sword upon the Poop, that we had done well to come up so: But our design was not to make War upon our Nation; be∣sides, that might have been enough to have broken our Voyage.</P>
<P>Holding then our Course, we had so favourable a Wind that we came near to the Isle of <HI>Lancelot</HI> the 6th of <HI>February;</HI> upon which day one of our Men fell over-board into the Sea, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Disaster.</NOTE> it was impossible to save him, because we had a right Wind. We presently
<PB N="42" REF="77"/>
tack'd about upon him; but coming to the place, where he fell. we found nothing but his Breeches. All things that belong'd to him were presently put to Sale upon the Deck, and every one Bought what he had occasion for, as Coats, Linnen, and other Things, with which he was very well furni∣shed: For he was of the Rank of the Nobility, and was named <HI>Duvall,</HI> of <HI>Vire</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>This done, we steered our Course towards the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coast of</HI> Barbary.</NOTE> next day the 11th of the same month, we arrived near the Land to find out a Port, and cast Anchor in a Creek or Bay, putting out our Boat to go on shore: But coming there, we found nothing but Desarts, without any thing else; insomuch, that we re∣turned again on Board the Ship to weigh Anchor, and to look out some other place more proper to stay in, and to fit up our Patache, scowring along this Coast all the rest of that day and the night following▪</P>
<P>Presently after, we found out the Mouth of the River <HI>Rio Del Oro,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rio del Oro.</NOTE> where we sent our Boat to Sound the
<PB N="43" REF="77"/>
depth of it, and to see if we might enter in so far as a little Island of flat Sand, which those in the Boat had perceived. They found but 12 Foot of Water, and our Ship drew already as many▪ so that the Keel touched Ground; but we had no harm, be∣cause the River was Calm. Coming then to this Island, within the River of▪ <HI>Rio del Oro,</HI> about five Leagues within from the Mouth, which is not taken notice of in the Map. We named the same, <HI>Touch Island,</HI> after <NOTE PLACE="marg">Touch-Island.</NOTE> the Sirname of our Commander, the Sieur <HI>de la Ravardiere,</HI> where we cast Anchor to tarry for some time. And the 15th of <HI>February</HI> we began to fit up our Patache, which was ready in our Ship, and only wanted Mounting and Chaulking.</P>
<P>During this time we went daily to look for Shells, the finest in the world, and seemed as if they were enamel'd with Gold: As I put some of them into my Handkerchief, the Poison within, (which was like little Snails) stained it into a Purple colour; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea Purple.</NOTE> perhaps it might be the same <HI>Espece de Murex,</HI> so celebrated by the Antients,
<PB N="44" REF="78"/>
and unknown at this time. We ga∣thered a great quantity of them for their Beauty. We caught also with our Nets, as much Fish as we could well find use for.</P>
<P>This Island was▪ full of <HI>Cormorants,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cormorants and their watch.</NOTE> of which we killed a great number with our Harquebus shot. Of these Birds there is always one that watches when the others take their rest, as 'tis said of the Cranes. We had much ado to come near them, and were forced to creep along the Ground to take them. But after they began to be a little frighted with the Harque∣busses, they came no more as before.</P>
<P>We tarried near a month in this place without seeing any Man; but about five or six days before our de∣parture, we perceived a Smoak in the Country, about three Leagues from us; which made us conjecture that there were some <HI>Lybians</HI> and Blacks <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Blacks of</HI> Lybia.</NOTE> come there, because towards the Coast, the Desarts of <HI>Lybia</HI> begin. These Blacks were come a great way out of the Country, to look towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oast to see if there was any Ship to Traffick for Ambergreece, and car∣ried
<PB N="45" REF="78"/>
their Water in Goat-Skins, cut out for that purpose. In the night time they creep into the Sand to Sleep, for fear of being smelt out by the Li∣ons and Tygers, who are there in abun∣dance.</P>
<P>It might be properly said, that these Men came out of Hell, they were so burnt, and dreadful to look upon: We sent then our Boat to know the cause of these Fires seen in the Coun∣try, and found three of these Lybians, (of which 2 came on board our Ship) and one of them told me, that he was the Kinsman of <HI>Taquide Alforme</HI> of <HI>Cape Blanc,</HI> of whom I enquir'd news, forasmuch as having heard of him in my former Voyage, towards <HI>Cape Blanc.</HI></P>
<P>This was the time that they fasted their <HI>Ramadan,</HI> and would not Eat any thing till night. 'Tis a great pity to see these People, how poor and mi∣serable they are, without Bread or-any other Food. They Eat nothing but Ostrich Eggs, and some dried Fish, besides some Flesh of the same.</P>
<P>He that had stayed alone on Shore, was Son to one of these other two,
<PB N="46" REF="79"/>
and came to receive his Father's com∣ing out of the Boat, prostrating him∣self before him, and kissing his Hand▪ Then his Father gave him some of the Bisquet that we had given him, of which he was exceeding glad, for he was very Hungry, and had supped but badly in these Desarts; for the most part inhabited by Wild Beasts▪ which are continually there: And from our Ship we heard sometimes in the night terrible Cries and Roaring.</P>
<P>In all this Coast we could not find any fresh Water, nor before in the Ri∣ver, where we sent our Boat to look for some, but in vain, all the Coun∣try being Desart, and quite Barren This Island where we had cast An∣chor, was directly under the Tropick of <HI>Cancer.</HI></P>
<P>Now having fitted up, and put out again our Patache to Sea, we set fail the 10th of <HI>March,</HI> and having born South West towards the Isles of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isles of</HI> Cape Verd. Sal, Santi∣ago, Fogo. Brava.</NOTE> we roved all along by the Isles of <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Santiago,</HI> and <HI>Fogo,</HI> to go to Anchor at that of <HI>Brava,</HI> where we tarried until the 22th of the same month.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="79"/>
All these Islands are much subject to Storms and Boisterous Winds, as it happened to us at this Isle of <HI>Brava,</HI> where we lost an Anchor, being ob∣lig'd to weigh and drop Anchor so frequently there, when the Wind would drive us sometimes towards Land, presently again to the Sea. 'Tis supposed that these Winds are shut up there in some Gulf, as they come out at certain hours of the day. And what is more strange, is, that a League from thence, the Sea was calm, and without Wind; which made me be∣lieve that these Winds being so shut up, and come out with such violence, have not the force to penetrate far, being struck back, and repulsed by the Winds which come from the Sea.</P>
<P>We could not find out the Habita∣tions of these Islanders; who are Por∣tuguese, Mestices, and Blacks: The Island bears Tobacco, abundance of Mace, and other Fruits. The Coun∣try is very Mountainous, and there are some Fig-Trees to be seen, with Mulbery-Trees, and others.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="80"/>
After we had well refreshed our selves with sweet▪ Water, dried Fish, and other things, which the Islanders sold us, we weighed Anchor to Steer our Course, and had the Wind so fa∣vourable, that we arrived at the Mouth of the River of the <HI>Amazons</HI> on <HI>Palm.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>River of the</HI> Ama∣zons.</NOTE> <HI>Sunday,</HI> about three hours before day. There are great Streams there about the Sea side, which run with a strange swiftness and horrible noise, carrying along with them Trees and Plants, which they pluck up by the Roots along the Coast.</P>
<P>We seeing our selves as soon as it was morning intangled amongst these roaring Streams and Currents, having scarce any Wind, they who were up▪on the Watch began to cry out, that we were all lost, thinking we had been upon the the Shelves▪ At this noise every one began to stir himself to look out for help; and I hearing this word <HI>Lost,</HI> mounted presently upon the Deck to see if there was any way to swim, and if we were near Land, having no other way to save our selves but by Swiming till day, hoping to have sight of Land, from
<PB N="49" REF="80"/>
which according to our Heights we were not far off. Hereupon the Pi∣lot well advis'd, took the Plummet in Hand, and found in Sounding 25 Fa∣thom; whereof being very glad, he cried out, that we were in the River <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>River of the</HI> Amazons.</NOTE> of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> which is almost one Degree on this side the Line. We made but little Sail in expectation of the day, that we might see Land, which we saw the next morning; and Sounding again, we found but nine Fathoms, and so lessening to three or four, and yet we saw no Land, which was a great trouble to us.</P>
<P>On Monday we descried Land, ve∣ry low towards the South West, and by little and little we app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oached the Coast, to have knowledge of the Country, but with fear to run a▪ground; for there the bottom is nothing but Mud, which we touched every mo∣ment.</P>
<P>As we were thus wandring about, by good chance we perceived a Canoe <NOTE PLACE="marg">Encounter with Indi∣ans.</NOTE> with 17 Indians, who came towards us, and went to our Patache which was before us, after that they came on board us: They were all naked,
<PB N="50" REF="81"/>
and Painted, as they go in these Coun∣tries, with their Crowns of Feathers; and told us that they came from War off the Cape of <HI>Caypour,</HI> one of the Capes near to the River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> and they had some Booty in their Canoe. Their Captain seemed to be a Man of good fashion, yet he was stark naked, and had only a Lan∣goutin, which is a little piece of painted Cotton, to cover his Privities. He spake with such a Grace, that he might have been taken for a Man of Counsel; for he spake softly, and gave a grace to all his Words and Gestures▪ After we had discoursed with him <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Country of</HI> Yapoco.</NOTE> about the Country, and where we should Anchor, he left us two Indians for Guides, who conducted us to the Land of <HI>Yapaco,</HI> in the Mouth of the River, or very near, and caused us to shelter our Ship in a private corner, so that when the Tide went out, she stuck upon the Mud; but the Tide coming in again raised her up.</P>
<P>Arriving then in this Country of <HI>Yapaco,</HI> we left the River of the <HI>Ama∣zons</HI> on the left Hand, on the other side of which, towards the South, is
<PB N="51" REF="81"/>
the great Country of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and on this side towards the North, are the <HI>Caripons,</HI> and <HI>Caribes.</HI></P>
<P>Thirty or forty Leagues off from this great River, we found along the Coast a certain Rock, which had Veins of the colour of Slate, with some silver mixed amongst it, out of which I took a little Stone I since lost. We saw there also the marks of some English▪ or Dutch Ship, that had passed by that way.</P>
<P>We arrived there on Monday night, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrival in the Land of</HI> Yapoco.</NOTE> and afterwards on Tuesday morning, the 10th of <HI>April,</HI> desiring to know what profit we might make in this Country, we went on Shore to Ex∣change Hatchets, Bills, Knives, and Glass-Beads of several colours, with divers other such like things.</P>
<P>We saw these Indians with two <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wood to strike Fire.</NOTE> little pieces of Wood strike fire<HI>:</HI> I made the Experiment of it since to the late King <HI>Henry the Great</HI> at <HI>Fon∣tainbleau,</HI> in the year 1605. All the Indians were run there from their Ha∣bitations, and had trimed up their Hammocks, or hanging Beds, made with Wreaths of Palm-Trees; and
<PB N="52" REF="82"/>
were in great numbers, Men, Women, and Children, all as naked as when they came out of their Mothers Bellies; except some Beads with which they decked their Bodies; and in their Ears they had long pieces of Wood and round Stones. They had brought a thousand Trifles, as Gumbs, <HI>Egrets Feathers,</HI> and Parrots, Tobacco, and other Things which the Country af∣forded. I did my Duty in Exchang∣ing, and took as much of their Mer∣chandize as I possibly could. We made our Bargains without speaking, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchan∣dize of the Country.</NOTE> shewing by signs what we would have, or give.</P>
<P>The King of this Country of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> named <HI>Anacajoury,</HI> was then making ready Cannoe's to go against the <HI>Ca∣ribes;</HI> This was the cause that we could not then make much Bartering in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s place: For they were all busie at work, some at the Cannoes, others to make Arms for their Visage; and others to prepare Victuals, which was the Women's Province: we saw all those People mighty busie at that. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine of the Country.</NOTE> Amongst others, they made a certain Wine, or Drink of Fruits, which ine∣britates
<PB N="53" REF="82"/>
like Beer or Citre: They chaw a certain Root, then Boil it, and after Strain it. There is another sort of it more thick, which is made of Fruits and Palms, as big as a Gall-Nut, they bruise only the Bark which is upon them; it's as yellow as an Orange; for they make nothing of the Nut; after that they Boil and Strain it. They have another sort, which might be taken for clear Milk, mixed with soft Cheese. I had a great mind to Taste of it, besides, being desired by them to Drink, I would not refuse, for fear they should have thought that I intended 'em any harm; inso∣much that they were mightily plea∣sed to see me Drink of it.</P>
<P>They do not love Melancholly and green Persons; and if you make sport with them in Jest, it must be <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nature and Manners of those</HI> In∣dians.</NOTE> in Laughing. I clapped them some∣times upon the Back with my Hand in Jest, but they would always return again the like in Laughing. They are very hardy and warlike, cour∣teous and liberal, and have very cheerful Looks.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="83"/>
The <HI>Caribes</HI> are not so, for they would give us, as the saying is, not so much as a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Patato.</NOTE> Patatte; This is a Root like a Turnip, but longer, and of a red and yellow colour: It is of a very good taste, and they Eat it boiled or roasted upon the Coals; but if it is often Eat of, it is very Disrellishing and Windy.</P>
<P>As for Fruits, they have several <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits.</NOTE> sorts of 'em, good to Eat, but wild and unknown to us, except the Ana∣nana's, or Figs which are very long, and as big as a great Pudding. They have Plantanes, or Fig-Trees, which the Spaniards call Plantins. They make small thin Cakes of <HI>Casav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which is a Root that they Grate upon a Stone, or a piece of Wood made in the form of a File; not having any Mortar to bruise it in: Then they put <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> it into a great Basket made of little Twigs, like Willows. These Roots also yield a juice which is poisonous. After having well pressed it, dried it, and sop'd it in Water, they make it <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> into a Paste, spread it upon a great flat Stone that is upon the Fire, which gives it the form of a very thin Cake.
<PB N="55" REF="83"/>
When it is done so, it may be kept three, or four years, or more, so it be laid in a dry place. I tasted of it, but it did not relish as our Bread, and I be∣lieve that one would soon be weary of Eating it often. They make seve∣ral other sorts of things to Eat, but very course and grosly, which is not very pleasant to those who are not accustomed vvith them.</P>
<P>I saw them make their preparations in the Lodgings of their King <HI>Anaca∣joury,</HI> to Victual the Cannoes which were to go to the War; but they put all these Casaves, or Cakes, (which I spoke of) into a Pile in the middle of the House, and their Drink in Gourd Bottles, which hold more than a Pail. For these Gourd Bottles are of a won∣derful greatness in comparison to ours.</P>
<P>I saw at the House of this King, a <HI>Caribe-Slave,</HI> whom they made to work to get ready these Victuals for the War. This little Naval Army was about 35 Cannoes, with 25 or 30 men in each.</P>
<P>But to return again to our arrival in this place of <HI>Yapaco;</HI> as soon as we <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>King</HI> Ana∣cajoury.</NOTE> were entered into this Country, the
<PB N="56" REF="84"/>
King <HI>Anacajoury</HI> gave us two of his Nephews in Hostage, if by chance any of ours should there loose him∣self, or his way: The Grandchild of this King led me about the Woods; for all the Coast is covered with Trees, and there was some Indians with him. This little Boy was very brisk, and mighty witty for a Savage, and shewed me the Fruits, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mance∣nille <HI>Fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI></NOTE> were good to Eat, and which not. Amongst others, they have a Fruit called <HI>Mancenille,</HI> of the bigness of an Orange, very yellow, and beautiful to look upon; but yet so venomous, that they say, if it is put never so lit∣tle to the Mouth, it kills immediately; and the Fish themselves, which are all along the Coast, who suck this Fruit, are carried by the Sea to Land: for the Tree which bears it is near to Sea, which comes up into these Woods, and drags along with it a thousand sorts of Fruits, as we saw in the River of the <HI>Amazons.</HI></P>
<P>The Fish who suck this Fruit, peel and loose their Scales: Whosoever Eats of this Fish loose all their Epi∣derme, or Upper-Skin, like the Le∣pers
<PB N="57" REF="84"/>
who Eat the Flesh of Vipers. As soon as any one finds himself seiz'd with such an accident, they presently conjecture they have Eat of the Poison of <HI>Mancen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lle,</HI> as the Spaniards have named it, who inhabit these <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>This King's Grand-Child shewed me several Herbs which they make use of, and one amongst others which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antidote against▪ Poison.</NOTE> serves them for an Antidote when they are struck with Poisoned Arrows. I took some of the Leaves of this Herb to compound an Unguent, which is an excellent remedy for Wounds, and other Sores. I would also have plucked up some of the Root, but this little Boy would not suffer it: And besides, the Indians who were with him, seemed to be very angry he had shewed me this Plant, which they prised and esteemed above all others. I would not insist any more thereupon, for fear his Grand-Father should be displeased with me.</P>
<P>After I had gathered a great quan∣tity of Plants, Fruits, and other Ra∣rities, I returned on board the Ship to lock them up.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="85"/>
On Tuesday the 11th of <HI>April,</HI> I went to their Habitations to see if I could get any more Curiosities, taking some Knives, and other Pedlars-Ware, to exchange with them. Our Pilo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being with me, we went into a Cabin, where there were a great number of Indians, Men and Women; and there were amongst the rest some about 17 or 18 years of Age, pounding in a Mortar made of a hollow piece of Wood, with a long Stick. I also took a Stick to help her to Pound, of which she was very glad, seeing I understood the manner of Pounding after their way: And though she was Stark-Naked, she cared not for my being over against <NOTE PLACE="marg">Innocent nakedn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> People.</NOTE> her. After that, she gathered us some Potato's, and besides those, gave us other Things to Eat, and all with an admirable Grace and Civility.</P>
<P>I believe these <HI>Caripous</HI> are of all the Indians the most sweet and mild in Behaviour: They are very curious of Honour, Ambitious to do Kindness to those who visit them: The Wo∣men, Girls, and Children, came very freely on board our Ship, without any shew of shame for their Naked∣ness,
<PB N="59" REF="85"/>
but were continually drawing their Legs close, like Half-Moons. There was a little Indian brought me some Balls of Tobacco, with a little Case made of the Bark of a Tree, as wide as a Pocket, and as round as a Ring: It's that which the Men make use of to bind up their Privy-Parts; they can easily change them, or take them away when they please. I took two or three of them for curiosity, seeing 'em so ingeniously made. All the In∣dians round about having heard the discharge of Cannon, came presently from every quarter that was nigh, to exchange their Goods with our Knives, Hatchets, and other small Ware.</P>
<P>When the Cannon had fired, the noise of it continued near a quarter of an hour in these rough Woods, so that all the Country, Mountains, and Val∣lies, were filled with the Eccho's, which answered one another with a wonderful noise, which might be heard as I believe, above 25 Leagues from thence.</P>
<P>As for the rest, these <HI>Caripous</HI> People are great Enemies to the <HI>Ca∣ribes,</HI> who make mortal War one <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caribes.</NOTE>
<PB N="60" REF="86"/>
upon the other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Ca∣ribes <HI>eat the</HI> Cari∣pous, <HI>but the</HI> ari∣pous <HI>do not eat them.</HI></NOTE> This little Grand∣son of the King of <HI>Yapaco</HI>'s, shewed me by signs, how the <HI>Caribes</HI> had great Teeth, and Biting his Arm, made me to understand that they Eat them when they happen to take them in War. The Hatred betwixt them is so great, that it is impossible ever to reconcile them; neverthe∣less I have heard say since, by a Ma∣riner of <HI>Haure de Grace,</HI> that they had made some sort of a Reconciliation be∣twixt 'em.</P>
<P>Being then amongst these Savages, I saw one day amongst others, the Captain of the Cannoes, whom we found at the first: He made me great Demonstrations of Friendship by his Gestures, saying, that he would bring me from his Country, (far from thence) several choice Things, and amongst others, some little pretty Parrots, speak∣ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Parrot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> their Language. Yet I waited not so much in expectation of his Pro∣mises, as to neglect to provide my self elsewhere. My first thing was a lit∣tle Parrot as big as a Sparrow, with a long Tail, and very Tame, which would with a wonderful Pleasure pick
<PB N="61" REF="86"/>
the Hair of the Beard, so that it could scarce be felt. I gave a little Knife in exchange for it. This Cap∣taih who had promised me so many Rarities, came to offer me amongst other Things, a Truss of Serpents, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpents good to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at.</NOTE> which were as Fat as a great Conger, and the Skin so speckled with yellow, grey, blue, and other colours, that I had no great mind to try how they relish'd, though some living on them, make great Feasts together: They are prepared in Leaves, and roasted. I also took notice that these <HI>Caripous</HI> live better than these <HI>Caribes;</HI> for they know how to make Cakes with Mace, which are very good, and have other things to Eat, agreeable enough to the Country where they live.</P>
<P>These People Eat also another sort of Serpents, like Adders, of a strange greatness and length. This Country of <HI>Yapoco</HI> is above 120 Leagues from the Country of <HI>Toupinambous,</HI> which is towards the River <HI>Maragnon,</HI> or <HI>Brasil:</HI> And those of <HI>Yapoco</HI> are of the same colour and swarthy Com∣plexion with the others, but they
<PB N="62" REF="87"/>
are far finer, more lively, and plea∣sant.</P>
<P>Speaking of this Captain, I will relate in this place a strange and re∣markable thing of these People, that the Nephew of <HI>Anacajoury</HI> told me, to whom the Soveraign Command of this Country belongeth, and because of his Youth, his Uncle governed un∣til such time as he should be of Age to Rule. He told me, That they did Eat neither Flesh nor Fish until <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Ceremonies to make Captains.</NOTE> they had killed some of their Enemies; and when they had killed any one of them in War, they observed this Ce∣remony, which should not be other∣ways agreeable to our French Cap∣tains. They make a Link of Palm in which they put him whom they de∣sign for Captain, who before he may Eat either Flesh or Fish, must under∣go therein the Exercise of their Wea∣pons; Then causing all the greatest Captains of the Country to come, who with the King of the place, make one after another, a Harrangue or Speech to this new one, telling him, that he must be couragious, hardy, and nimble in Battel, and never give
<PB N="63" REF="87"/>
Ground but upon great occasion, and with Judgment undergo all the hardships of War, be they never so great; and love the Virtue, Honour, and Reputation of a good and just Coptain. VVhen they have finished this Discourse, they take a great Switch in Hand, wherewith every one gives him three great Blows, with all their force, so that the Body is all over Black and Bloody, upon which Bli∣sters may be seen to rise as big as ones Finger; and so one after another make him the same Discourse, repeating so many Blows with the Switch; which lasts a full Month, 3 or 4 times a Week. In the mean time this poor Patient in all that time Eats nothing but Casaves and Potates, until he has had all his Ornaments of Virtue. And then they make a great Fire, putting thereon Green Leaves to make it Smoak, and also to hinder the force of the Flame; Then they have an <HI>Amica,</HI> or Hanging Bed after their manner, in which they put this new Captain, crowning him with Leaves; and there he must endure all the Heat and Smoak untill hr Swoon's away,

and seeing he scarce Breaths, they let the Bed down, and taking plenty of fresh Water, they cast it upon him, untill he comes again to him∣self, as from Death to Life. All this being done, he is Honoured as a great Captain, and then they go a Cruising along the Coasts to meet their Ene∣mies: After being upon their return to their Habitations, they make still Remonstrances to this new Captain, and give him each one, three Blows; and from thence forth he may Eat Flesh. Sometime after that, they take another turn in the Sea with their Cannoes; and if they find any of their Enemies, they fail not to return to perfect this Captain, to whom they give three Blows more, and then he may Eat Fish; and so he is created and admitted into the Office, to bear Command over the others. But that is not done but to those who have well behaved themselves in Battle, knock∣ing down many Enemies.</P>
<P>I leave it to you, if our Men of War (who come to this Honour most commonly by the Purse, than Virtue) would Buy that Honour at so dear a
<PB N="65" REF="88"/>
Rate as these poor Savages do: Yet what I wonder at most of all, is, that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Admirable patience of these</HI> Indi∣ans.</NOTE> the Indian who suffers these Blows with a Switch, is neither to st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, nor cry out in the least, but only to shrink up his Shoulders if he please.</P>
<P>As for my part, I saw almost the like in my return: For we had in our Ship three Indians, whom we brought into <HI>France,</HI> two <HI>Caribes,</HI> Brothers, and one <HI>Caripou,</HI> Nephew to the King of <HI>Yapoco.</HI></P>
<P>Now one of these Brother <HI>Caribes,</HI> the least named <HI>Atoupa,</HI> (we being <NOTE PLACE="marg">Atoupa</NOTE> in the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> where the <HI>Caribes</HI> are) said, He would go into <HI>France,</HI> but he thought the Ship was <HI>France,</HI> and called it so; but when we were to go away, he strove with all his force to leap into the Sea, to save himself on Land; And we being at Anchor in the River, to hinder him we gave him in custody to the <HI>Caripou Yapoco,</HI> their sworn Enemy; so that at every step that <HI>Atoupa</HI> took, <HI>Yapoco</HI> took another, following him up and down every where in the Ship, and bid us let him alone, and if at any time he were so bold as to cast him∣self
<PB N="66" REF="89"/>
into the Sea, he also would be presently after him, and make him Dive his Head to the bottom, to Drink to his Friends. This little <HI>Caribe Atoupa,</HI> not being above 14 or 15 years of Age, one day took a resolu∣tion to Drown or Kill himself, as he could best have occasion; and had cast himself into the Sea had not he, who, ever had an eye upon him, catched hold of his Legs. When we were in the main Sea, his Brother held him continually Embraced, and in the night he tied him, but he was often found untied; and seeing that he could find no expedient to Drown or Kill himself, (for he was not suffered to get to any Knives, wherewith he might do himself a mischief) one day finding a piece of sharp pointed Wood, he struck <HI>Yapoco</HI> such a blow there∣with upon the Throat, that it sliced away the Skin from one side of his Neck; which our General hearing of, caused him to be brought upon the Deck, and with a Whip made of Pack thread, tied to a Stick, to be se∣verely Whipp'd, but he seemed as if he had not been touched, only shrink∣ing
<PB N="67" REF="89"/>
up his Shoulders a little, without either crying out, or speaking one word; which seemed very strange to me, seeing him so marked with the Stripes he had received so severely.</P>
<P>But to return again to our Traffick in this Country of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> having made Exchange of all the Merchandize that could be found there, we took a reso∣lution to go to the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cayenne <HI>River.</HI></NOTE> where the <HI>Caribes</HI> are: But before our departure, the King of <HI>Yapoco</HI> came on board our Ship, with his Wife, his Sister, and his Mother, with the In∣dian <HI>Yapoeo</HI> whom we carried away with us, who was his Nephew, his Sister's Son, in whose room the King <HI>Anacajoury</HI> governed, untill his Majo∣rity, which would be in a short time. This Nephew told me, that he had almost received all the Orders of Cap∣tain, having undergone the same that all the others do who would attain to that Degree; and that he had been upon an Incursion, and had already Eaten Flesh, but not Fish, which was his last Ornament for the heighth of Honour. His Uncle, and his Mo∣ther put him into our Hands, and ear∣nestly
<PB N="68" REF="90"/>
desired us by no means to suffer him to fall into the hands of the <HI>Ca∣ribes,</HI> their Enemies, nor the Spani∣ards, having heard of the Cruelty that they had exercised against those <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spanish Cruelty.</NOTE> of their Country, and of the bad usage they had done to those of <HI>Jucatan, Zempallan, Tlaxcallan, Panuco, Tecow∣antep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c,</HI> and <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>This King also desired our assistance against the <HI>Caribes,</HI> and that he would go with us, with his Naval-Army, which was ready prepared, as I have said before; and that all the Booty that was taken should be ours: But our General having a mind to Traffick sairly with these <HI>Caribes,</HI> would not yield to his demand, only he promised to keep his Nephew safe, and that he would not assist the <HI>Caribes</HI> against him. This Nephew who went along with us, was drawn on by an Indian, Son to the King of the Island of <HI>Tri∣nidad,</HI> that the English had taken by Subtillity, and who served us for an Interpreter. It was the <HI>Millord-Ralle</HI> who carried him away in a Voyage; yet he did not understand fo well the Language of the <HI>Caripous,</HI> being at so
<PB N="69" REF="90"/>
great a distance from them; besides, it is a Language very particular, and different also from that of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> who have much ado to understand it, though they are not above 30 Leagues one from the other. Now this Indian Interpreter, having a mind to Marry one of the Daughters of <HI>Anacajoury,</HI> and already treated with the Father about it, had caused his Cloaths and other Things to be brought on Shore, telling this King that he would make War upon the <HI>Caribes</HI> with him, because they had Eaten one of his Brothers; Of which our General be∣ing advertised, commanded him not to stir, seeing he was so necessary to us for the Language. He seeing him∣self detained by force, never rested untill he had persuaded <HI>Yapoco,</HI> this young Boy that we kept for Hostage, with one of his Brothers, telling him such pleasant Things of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> that neither his Mother, nor his Uncle could disswade him; so he came into <HI>France</HI> with us, where, upon his arrival he was set to turn the Spit, at which he was so offended, that he went away from <HI>Cancale</HI> to <HI>St. Malo</HI>'s,
<PB N="70" REF="91"/>
without saying a word, but was thence fetched again: This was in the year 1604.</P>
<P>Since, in the year 1613, upon my return from my Voyages to <HI>Paris,</HI> li∣ving <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>History of the Indian</HI> Yapoco.</NOTE> in the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> as Keeper of the Cabinet of Rarities to the King, the Sieur <HI>de Rasilly</HI> came back from those Parts of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and hearing that he had brought along with him some <HI>Brasilians,</HI> to present to the King and the Queen Regent, I went one morn∣ing to the Capuchins, were they were, as well to see them, as to hear News of the Sieur <HI>de la Ravardiere,</HI> Lieute∣nant to Monsieur <HI>de Rasilly,</HI> who had tarried behind at <HI>Maragnon,</HI> to go to the River of the <HI>Amazons:</HI> But I was no sooner entered into the Cham∣ber where these <HI>Brasillian Toupinam∣beax</HI> were, when I perceived <HI>Yapaco,</HI> who knowing me, came presently to me and caught me about the Neck to embrace me, telling me all his For∣tunes, and how he was returned to <HI>Brasil,</HI> within almost 200 Leagues of his own Country of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> where he could not go; and that he went to <HI>Marguan,</HI> a little Island of <HI>Brasil;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maraguan</NOTE>
<PB N="71" REF="91"/>
Then he embarked in a little Ship with the Segnior <HI>du Bos,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> who was come from the Voyage that I made with Monsieur <HI>de la Ravardiere;</HI> but having been taken by the Pirates towards <HI>England,</HI> he found means afterwards to return into <HI>France,</HI> and went to find out Madam <HI>de la Ravardiere</HI> in <HI>Poictou,</HI> where he had been before, the other Voyage, and told her News of her Husband, who tarried behind at <HI>Brasil.</HI> It happened that one day, a Hog falling into the Castle Ditch, this Lady commanded her Servants, and among the rest <HI>Yapoco,</HI> to help to draw him out; but he, though born in the Country of the Savages▪ dis∣daining a piece of work so vile and base, told her plainly, that he would not do it; upon which, the Lady giving him some harsh Language, he out of Anger went away without a farewel, and came streight to <HI>Rochelle,</HI> where he found some <HI>Hablois,</HI> who brought him to the <HI>Havre,</HI> and from thence he went to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="92"/>
When I had thus met with him, and Caressed him, I carried him to my Lodging, where I treated him as well as I could: After that, I took him to the King, who desired to see him: I caused him to Kneel before the King, who commanded me to speak to him in his own Language, for I under∣stood a little of it; Then he ordered some Money to be given him.</P>
<P>After that, he was carried to the <HI>Havre,</HI> where Madam <HI>de la Ravar∣diere</HI> sent for him by her Servants, and since I heard no more News of him: Such was the Fortune of this young <HI>Yapoco.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to these People, Sa∣vage <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Good Na∣ture of the</HI> Caripous.</NOTE> as they are, they are great Friends to Honour, and of all that which is just and true, which they reverence from their Infancy, abhorring all wicked Men and Cheats, as much as they are Friends to the good and ver∣tuous. They do not Love a Coward, or a Pultron, but Honour such as are Valiant and Couragious.</P>
<P>But since we are still near the River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> before we part from thence, it will not be much amiss to
<PB N="73" REF="92"/>
say something of it from what I was able to learn in those Parts.</P>
<P>Some have taken the River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> or <HI>Oregliane,</HI> for that of <HI>Maragnan;</HI> but others will make two of them, and say, that their Mouths are distant some hundred Leagues; that of <HI>Maragan</HI> making the limits of <HI>Brasil</HI> on the Northen Coast, as the River of Plate, or Silver, makes the other Bounds on the South. All these Rivers come from the Moun∣tains of <HI>Peru,</HI> the highest, and of the difficultest access of any others in the whole World.</P>
<P>The River of the <HI>Amazons</HI> is very <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>River of the</HI> Amazons.</NOTE> broad in its Mouth, some 50 Leagues or thereabouts from one Shore to the other, and contains several great Islands.</P>
<P>The Sea there runs at the hours of the Tide, being very swift in its Eb∣bing and Flowing, and carries along with it many Trees and Plants it plucks up by the Roots, all along the Coasts, which are like great Forests; for there the Coast being low, the Sea easily enters far up into the Country. The colour of this River inclines to a
<PB N="74" REF="93"/>
dark grey: We found the Water of it Sweet 30 Leagues within the Sea. Within this River, about 30 or 40 Leagues up, are some Islands where these Warlike Women, the <HI>Amazons</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amazons <HI>Warlike Women.</HI></NOTE> inhabit, who make War upon those of the Continent of the Coast of <HI>Brasil;</HI> and on the other side, where the Indians inhabit, towards the Cape of <HI>Voyanpouc,</HI> are their Friends and constant Confederates. These Wo∣men for Propagation, have to do every year with the said Indians in the month of <HI>April,</HI> and give them notice when they desire to have them come to see them, all the Days and Hours of that month, and do not suffer the said In∣dians to enter into their Islands more strong than themselves, setting some to guard the entrance, whilst others pass away their time, exchanging al∣ways these guards, by their turn, and so imploying all this Month of Love in the soft Caresses of Joy and De∣light. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Month of Love.</NOTE> At the end of the year, when their Confederates return to them, if they have Conceived in the mean time, they keep the Females, and give the Males to the Men, not keep∣ing
<PB N="75" REF="93"/>
them above a year; And 'tis pro∣bable that these Sons which they give to these Indians, may afterwards have to do with their Sisters and near Kins-Women; For they have a Custom always to seek out the Children of those they have had to do with. Now, though these Indians should be all Married in the Continent, these <HI>Ama∣zons</HI> serve them only for Friends, and make Presents to one another for a sign of Mutual Love and Good Will. As to that which some say, that they wear but one Breast, and Burn off the other, according to the manner of the ancient <HI>Amazons,</HI> who inhabited towards the <HI>Thanais</HI> and <HI>Thermodon,</HI> they are nothing but Fables. 'Tis true▪ that these Women do on purpose lose the Milk of one Breast that they may the better draw the Bow; and so perhaps this saying of the Ancients is to be understood.</P>
<P>The Son of the King of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> amongst other Things, told me, That these Women wear the Hair of their Privy-Parts very long, Combing them like their Heads, and that they are of a very great stature; adding also,
<PB N="76" REF="94"/>
that he had been in their Country with his Uncle <HI>Anacajoury.</HI></P>
<P>We could not go to see them, as we desired, because the Streams there are too violent for Vessels, and espe∣cially for our Ship and Patache, who drew in already abundance of Water: For the Streams run towards the Coast, and 'tis impossible to go there except it be with a Boat and Oars, or with the Indians Cannoes, which draw but one Foot of Water.</P>
<P>Behold what I was able to learn of these <HI>Amazons;</HI> which makes me not to give credit to all that we find writ∣ten of those antient Women, so famous. 'Tis said that there are still some of them in <HI>Africa,</HI> towards the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Monomotapa.</HI></P>
<P>All the Country on the Left Hand, at the entrance into the River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> is comprehended in the great Province of <HI>Brasil,</HI> first discove∣red by <HI>Alvarez Cabral,</HI> a Portugal Captain, in the year 1500, and by <HI>John Vincent</HI> and <HI>Arias Pinco,</HI> who in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e year 1509. discovered the great River <HI>Maragnan,</HI> reckoned the biggest
<PB N="77" REF="94"/>
in the World. Since, <HI>Americus Vespu∣ceus,</HI> and others, made a fuller disco∣very of those Countries. In the year 1542, the French Captain <HI>Oregliane,</HI> sent by <HI>Gonzale-Pizarro</HI> the Spaniard, found out the River which comes from the Province <HI>Atunquixo,</HI> thirty Leagues from the South Sea. He parted from <HI>Peru,</HI> and followed this River, descending above 400 Leagues in a streight Line to its Mouth, and more than 1700 with the turn∣ings and windings, finding many Peopled Islands.</P>
<P>He was eight months in this Na∣vigation, with a thousand Perils and Incommodities; and reported, that he had found (upon a certain Rivulet here) Women Archers, which are of the <HI>Amazons:</HI> The Spaniards had Wars with them.</P>
<P>Before this, <HI>Columbus</HI> in his second Voyage had discovered these <HI>Amazons</HI> in an Isle, which the Indians call <HI>Ma∣dannina</HI> or <HI>Martinina.</HI> This Captain <HI>Oregliane</HI> gave his name to this great River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> which he took for <HI>Maragnan,</HI> as the modern Navigators seem to agree: And indeed, they who
<PB N="78" REF="95"/>
were in the year 1612. in the Coun∣try of the <HI>Toupinambous,</HI> and in the Isle of <HI>Maragnan,</HI> report, That there is no River there of this Name, but only a Creek or Bay, in which is this Isle of <HI>Maragnan:</HI> This Name hath perhaps been the cause that this River towards <HI>Oregliane,</HI> or that of the <HI>Ama∣zons,</HI> hath been taken for another River of <HI>Maragnan,</HI> though they are one and the same.</P>
<P>But to return to our departure from the Country of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> to go towards <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parting from</HI> Ya∣poco.</NOTE> the <HI>Caribes</HI> Man-Eaters, we departed from thence on <HI>Easter-Day,</HI> the 15th of <HI>April</HI> in the year 1604. bearing a∣long the Coast, and our Ship running a-ground when▪ the Tide went out, we were forced to strike Sail, and cast Anchor until the Sea floated us again. We run all along the Coast, which is very pleasant, and filled with an infi∣nite number of green Trees, which ren∣der all these places very sweet and agreeable.</P>
<P>We had no sooner approached the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> than we perceived a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cayenne.</NOTE> Cannoe, which came on board our Ship, and there was in it, one named
<PB N="79" REF="95"/>
<HI>Yago,</HI> Brother to <HI>Camaria,</HI> King of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caribes.</NOTE> <HI>Caribes,</HI> who having spied the Nephew <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camaria.</NOTE> of <HI>Anacajoury</HI> whom we had in our Ship, was mightily surprised at first, not knowing what to think of our coming with this <HI>Yapoco</HI> their Sworn Enemy. Nevertheless, he failed not to guide us in this River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> which is very pleasant, and convenient for Ships to abide in, being 5 or 6 Fathoms deep, in some places more, add others less. This <HI>Yago</HI> told us, That he knew well enough the King of <HI>Yapoco</HI> was preparing him∣self to come and visit them, and that they expected him within 3 or 4 days, as their <HI>Toupan</HI> or Devil had told them; which was true: For while we continued there for some days, at the end of 'em our General sent some of his Men into the Country, with <HI>Cama∣ria</HI> their King; one of my Servants also went along with them, to procure me some of the most curious and rare Things he could find. Being come to a place where <HI>Camaria</HI> conducted them, 5 or 6 Leagues from thence, they found out, that <HI>Anacajoury</HI> had been there, with his Naval-Army,
<PB N="80" REF="96"/>
and had wasted and burnt the Country, and carried away a great number of the Inhabitants from this Coast, and saw also how they served their Enemies, who had been killed upon the place.</P>
<P>They Eating them Roasted, an <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cannibals <HI>or Man-Eaters.</HI></NOTE> Indian Woman offered a roasted Hand to our General, but he angrily refused it.</P>
<P>Our General had already▪ been a∣mongst them in the first Voyage, but having seen some of their Cruelties, would go there no more, yet he sent some of his men, as I have said be∣fore:</P>
<P>My Servant being returned, told me, they made great lamentations at <HI>Camaria</HI> for the loss they had suffered; and that <HI>Camaria</HI> thereupon was trou∣bled in such a manner, that it was impossible to appease him; yet he comforted them as well as he could, promising to order the Business so as to get into his Hands <HI>Yapoco</HI> the King <HI>Anacajoury</HI>'s Nephew, to make a So∣lemn Feast of him; and that they should e're long have Revenge upon their Enemies, whom they would with
<PB N="81" REF="96"/>
Joy Feast upon at their Pleasure. There was an Indian Woman, who, knowing my Servant was a Surgeon, entreated him to Cure her of a blow of a Sword, she had received upon her Head: But he perceiving that the Skull was split, and the Brains to be seen, told her freely he could give her no help. There were several others wounded, to whom he did what help he was able.</P>
<P>Whilst he was amongst them, he told me, that one Night retiring with them into their Cabbins, (made of Branches of Palms) he saw the Cere∣monies observed to their Husbands and Friends who had been killed in the fight.</P>
<P>First, An Indian Woman, sitting upon her <HI>Amica,</HI> or Hanging-Bed, be∣gan a Song, very pleasant and agree∣able, which continued a long time. That done, she came to reckon up the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies of the Dead.</NOTE> Exploits of her Dead Husband, how he had Loved her, been Valiant against his Enemies, excellent in Drawing the Bow, able to undergo all the Hardships of War, and a thousand other Gallantries and Perfections, of
<PB N="82" REF="97"/>
which she gave a particular account. After that, one of these Indians raised himself from his <HI>Amica,</HI> and went to desire the others to lament; where∣upon they presently fell to Howling so strangely, that one would have thought them to be out of their Wits. These Lamentations ended, they rose up to make Merry with the Flesh of their Enemies, with some Lizards and Crocodiles intermix'd, and all roasted together, thus Feasting upon the Graves of their Husbands and dead Friends, thinking themselves thus to have obliged them. Thus much, my Servant told me, he had taken notice of concerning their Ceremonies to their departed Friends.</P>
<P>In the mean time we Equipped our Boat, the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> to go to find out the end of the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> and know from whence it comes, and takes its head. We had with us two <HI>Indians,</HI> to shew us some Brasil, where∣of they make their Bows, and having taken with us a Barrel of Liquor, and some Bisquet for Victuals, we spent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coast of the River of</HI> Cayenne <HI>and Voyage upon it.</HI></NOTE> all the rest of the day and the night in rowing along the Coast, which
<PB N="83" REF="97"/>
is very pleasant; and there are a thou∣sand several sorts of Birds making such a noise, that it is a very dreadful thing to hear them.</P>
<P>There is in every place a great num∣ber of Flies, like unto a sort of Gnats, which are very troublesome, and tor∣mented us mightily both night and day, but especially in the night time. The next morning we arrived at the end of this River, seeing a violent Stream that descended from a Moun∣tain into a Valley, where it is below like a Lake, then comes to pass upon a Rock very flat and broad, and from thence falleth down as into a hollow Ditch, which groweth wider by lit∣tle and little, until it casteth it self into the Sea; the Tide comes up to the place where it beginneth to fall. We found no great matter in this Voyage, except several sorts of strange Creatures, and Indian-Hens of ano∣ther sort than those of our <HI>Europe:</HI> The old ones carry their young, and would not fly away, seeing us, but were very tame. These Hens have Feathers upon their Heads which are black and very beautiful, and like
<PB N="84" REF="98"/>
to those of a Heron. We carried some of them to our Ship, but we could not preserve them all until we came into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In short, we found all this Coast Desart; and being returned on Board, we told what we had seen in this Voyage: Our General sent us again to discover another River, which se∣parates it self from that of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> and runs towards the South-East.</P>
<P>We prepared our Boat, with some Indians, thinking it had not been ve∣ry far off, or else not well understand∣ing our Interpreters, insomuch that we took not Victuals enough with us, only I furnished my self with some Bisquet, acd gave of it to one of our Indians, who was very glad of this Provision that I had made.</P>
<P>Having then Rowed a good way up into this River, we found nothing but Branches of Trees, which co∣vered in a manner all the passage, so that we were forced ever and anon to lie all along in the Boat, to pass un∣derneath these Branches of Trees, which were laded with Oysters. At last we came to a certain place where
<PB N="85" REF="98"/>
there were Trees cut down by the Peo∣ple of some Ships that had been there before us. These were exceeding <NOTE PLACE="marg">Red-Wood.</NOTE> great, and the Heart very red like unto Brasil, yet it was not so as I have experienced it.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Indian whom I had given the Bisquet to, did not mind to follow our Men, but sought for something to live upon, and came again presently towards me, shewing me by Signs, he had found something good for us, and went to find out the Wooden-Bowl of the Boat, which served only to cast out the Water; so led only me along with him, a good way into the Wood, to a Tree cut down, which was hollow, and had in it a Bee-Hive, the most excellent, clear, sweet and agreeable that could be imagined. This Honey was of a Jelly, like Oil, and exceeding clear, of a greenish colour, and enclosed in Bags, like those great Purses the Mer∣chants use, wherein there is several lit∣tle Leather ones. There the Honey is environ'd with a Membrane or Skin, which is the <HI>Crisis,</HI> very clear: When this little Skin is broke, the Honey
<PB N="86" REF="99"/>
comes out of this only, and not the others; so the Indian broke one after another, throwing the Honey into the Bowl, which he gave me to drink of as a choice Liquor.</P>
<P>Having taken some of it in this manner, he went to look for Water to mix with it, to the end that we might have the more of it, as also to quench our Thirst the better.</P>
<P>In the mean time our Companions were in another place, on the other side of this Wood, seeking for the Brasil-Trees. I saved some of this Honey in the Bowl, not having else∣where to put it: But our Thirsty Peo∣ple returning▪ from this Wood, and taking the Bowl to Drink, mixed Water with the Honey, and so drank it up; which caused me to Quarrel with out Carpenter who had done it on purpose, like a Man of his Coun∣try, where they are born to Envy and Malice. I bore the loss of this Honey, so excellent, as patiently as possibly I could, because our Lieutenant was there, who had not a mind to do what this bold Carpenter did, but
<PB N="87" REF="99"/>
had taken Water with his Hand out of the River to Drink.</P>
<P>I could never since find any more of this sweet Liquor, by whatever Signs I could make to the King of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> to cause him to under∣stand what it was; for he did not know the name of it. But what I wondered at most, was, that this In∣dian could so easily find out this Ho∣ney in these Woods, seperating him∣self from the others for that reason. If I could have saved only 3 or 4 Ounces of it, I would not have parted with it for any thing whatsomever, but would preciously have preserved it, to make a Present thereof to the late King my dear Master; as I gave him some of that which I brought from <HI>Africa,</HI> which he found of an excellent Taste, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Honey of</HI> Africa.</NOTE> and caused me to lay it carefully up in his Trunk, as they do in the same Country from whence I had brought it. This Honey of <HI>Africa</HI> was as white as Snow, clear, and of an ex∣cellent good Taste; also the King confessed, that he had never before seen any so excellent: But that was but course Honey in comparison to
<PB N="88" REF="100"/>
this of the Country of the <HI>Caribes.</HI> The Bees which make this Honey in the <HI>West-Indians,</HI> are of a pale and yellowish colour, little and harmless, and are not troublesome at all, as I found out in the place whence I took this Honey, which was like to a most precious Balm, and I believe, that as the Honey of <HI>Africa</HI> is excellent for Healing of Wounds, so this of the <HI>Indies</HI> quite exceeds it every way, as in its consistence, taste, smell and colour.</P>
<P>Being then returned from this Ri∣ver, where we could discover nothing to serve our turn, our General was resolved to send me vvith the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Voyage to the Ca∣ribes.</NOTE> of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> to go to their Habita∣tions, and look in the Woods, to see if vve could there find a certain Tree, vvhich is a sort of Wood of Aloes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aloes Wood.</NOTE> called by them <HI>Apariebou,</HI> for vve had found of it in the Country of <HI>Yaposo.</HI> For this effect, I parted the 29th of <HI>April,</HI> vvith <HI>Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ria,</HI> the King of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> vvho had left in Hostage for me 7 or 8 of his Indians, and Em∣barked in a Cannoe, with vvhich vve entered into a little River, vvhich
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>
runs about two Leagues up into the Country, and was very narrow, the Branches of Trees quite covering it, so that we had a thousand Inconve∣niencies, and much ado to lie flat down in the Boat to avoid 'em. The Indians being stark Naked did not matter it so much; for if these Branches had made them tumble in∣to the River, they knew so well how to Swim, that they would not have much needed to fear: That which did us the most harm, was, that some of these Branches were laden with cer∣tain Oysters, little, and of the colour <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oysters.</NOTE> of Pearls, of a very good Taste; for I was willing to try, opening some before these Indians, who wondered mightily to see me open 'em so easily, not knowing how to do it.</P>
<P>We went thus Rowing along to find out their Dwellings, that at last coming to the end of the River, we went on Shore, and about a League and a half from thence, we saw one of their Habitations, and the <HI>Caribes</HI> came about us, offering to their King, Fruit, and other Things to Eat, with which he also presented me▪ After
<PB N="90" REF="101"/>
that, we left this Habitation and con∣tinued our way towards that of <HI>Cama∣ria:</HI> When we were come to the foot of a Mountain, this King fell a crying out as loud as he could, and desired me also to do the like, which I did, and I believe that it was to call home all those who were about the Woods, because thereupon they presently re∣turned to the Habitation; for I saw them run from all parts to their place, which was in a Valley, where being come, I found a great number of <HI>Ca∣ribes,</HI> Men and Women; amongst the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> King of the</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> others, the Wife of <HI>Camaria,</HI> who was making an Amica or Bed of Cotton. All these Indians, Men and Women, naked as they were, came running to see me and my Companion, a young Carpenter of our Ship, who was un∣der a mortal apprehension that they would Eat him, desiring me mightily to give them something of that which I had brought to exchange with them▪ Then I commanded them to make <HI>Ovato Courende,</HI> which is to say, a good Fire, because we had been Wet with the Rain, by the way, which the In∣dians did not much matter, being
<PB N="91" REF="101"/>
not much▪ troubled to dry their own Cloaths: They presently made me a a Fire, it being very late at night, so that we were pretty well dried in this great Hall where all these Indians were; and thus we Supped with the King and his Wife, in the sight of all the others: They made mighty much of us with their Savage Victuals. I had brought a Bottle of Wine and some Bisquet with me, which was no small help to us, after so many Fa∣tigues by the way, troublesome with Water and Woods, where sometimes the Indians were forced to carry me upon their Backs in certain places that were very hollow.</P>
<P>After Supper, the King caused us <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amacas <HI>or Hanging Beds.</HI></NOTE> to retire into his House, where he or∣dered two Amica's or Beds to be hung up for me and my Companion. They had put my Bed so, that it joyned to the King's, and my Companion's a lit∣tle higher; and that of the Queen's was on the same side with the King's; and all the night there was Guards which kept a Fire near the King and me. Our poor Carpenter did nothing else but tremble all the night long,
<PB N="92" REF="102"/>
thinking every moment they were coming to Eat us.</P>
<P>The King <HI>Camaria</HI> in the mean <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>King</HI> Ca∣maria.</NOTE> time began to discourse with me of the King of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> whom he said he did not fear, and who had come up into one of his Rivers, where he had killed a great number of his People; but that he desired mightily, (if it was possible) to have in his Clutches, his Nephew <HI>Yapoco,</HI> who was in our Ship, and that I should speak thereof to our General, and use my utmost Policy and Endeavour to have him delivered up, that he might be Eaten, saying that he would send for all his Subjects and his Friends to be at this Feast of the <HI>Caripou.</HI></P>
<P>As for my part, when he talked to me after this manner, I would not con∣tradict him, but gave him the hearing, and promised, if I could, to do all he desired: And he told me that he would willingly give all he had to have this poor <HI>Yapoco,</HI> and that I would take care to have him delivered up, which I durst not refuse him.</P>
<P>I thought this Night very long, seeing also that the Queen, Wife of
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
<HI>Camaria</HI> did not sleep. I rose up two or three times to go out of the House, continually suspecting the Malice and Cruelty of these <HI>Anthropaphages,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Anthropo∣phages, <HI>or</HI> Cannibals.</NOTE> Eaters of Human Flesh: Besides that, I perceived in the middle of this House, a Toad of the strange and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wonderful Toad.</NOTE> most horrible bigness that ever I saw; and I believe that it was rather some Devil than a Toad, because <HI>Camaria</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caribes <HI>speak with the Devil.</HI></NOTE> often spoke with the Devil, to know what their Enemies were doing.</P>
<P>As soon as it was day, I presently rose up to know what we had to do, and <HI>Camaria</HI> shewed me his Throat, which was very much out of order by a Cold that he had.</P>
<P>I carried him with me into the Woods to seek for Herbs fit for his Disease, and used my utmost to pro∣cure some Honey to compose a Re∣medy for him; but he could neither understand me, or comprehend what I demanded of him. At last, having Break∣fasted, we went along with some In∣dians to look for Wood of Aloes. This is a Tree of an extraordinary bigness, bearing Leaves like a Fig-Tree, but a little greener: The Tree contains in
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
its Heart a black Wood, very oiley, sharp, and of a very good Odour; And a Tree as big as a Tunn shall have in its Heart but a very little quantity of this black Wood. This Tree is very hard, and where it is black, 'twill sink to the bottom of Water like a Stone. We laded thereof about 35 Tuns, which are 70000 pound weight or thereabouts. We laded Store of 2 or 3 other sorts of Wood, one re∣sembling a Red-Sandal, and the other a Cittern, and partly of the same Odour. It is of a very sweet Scent when first cut, but by succession of time it comes to lose its Odour. I have learnt that this black Wood is certainly a sort of Wood of Aloes, but not so sweet-scented as that of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> because it comes so far upon the Sea, receiving thereby a certain Saltish quality. But at such time as I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> being in an Ensarail where the Idolaters Work, I there saw some Wood of Aloes of the River of <HI>Ganges,</HI> which was sweet, and had almost the same qualities as that of the West, as I since found out by curious <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Virtue of the Wood of</HI> Aloes.</NOTE> Experience. The Gentiles told me
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
that this Wood was very excellent and odoriferous, and neither Rotten nor Worm-eaten, and was chiefly a good Remedy for the Head-Ach, or the Ague. For the Head-Ach, you must rub this Wood against a flat Marble, agitating it with Rose-Water, or com∣mon; then rub the Forehead there∣with. And for the Ague, drink Water thus agitated, taking 2 or 3 Ounces. This Virtue is not found in that Wood of Aloes which is brought us, because it is quite Rotten and Worm-eaten, having in it no other Virtue but for the Perfumes, and very little for Medicine; So that I advise all curious Apothecaries to chuse for the good and right Wood of Aloes, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>True Wood of</HI> Aloes.</NOTE> which is sharp, joined with a certain bitterness. As for the colour, the best is that which is black, enclined to grey with Veins, very hard and ponderous, rendering a sweet-scent in the burning, and above all very Gummy. These are the marks of the best as far as I could take notice of in my Travels. I know very well that the price thereof is a little high, and that is the reason why it is so
<PB N="96" REF="104"/>
seldom kept in Shops, where they have instead thereof the Sandal-Cittern, which is of a quite contrary Faculty and Vertue: And so likewise of the Turbit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which is a Root.</NOTE>, of which they chuse more of that which is white, light and falling to Powder in the breaking, (than the grey) which is of a sweet scent, gummy and heavy, which is the good and right, as I have seen at <HI>Goa,</HI> where they gather it. The Indians themselves never make use of any other sort than the grey in∣clining to white; but one Dram of that will make more in effect than three of the other; and I believe that this white is not the right Tur∣bit, never having seen any such in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but that it rather comes from <HI>Persia,</HI> because 'tis brought from <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Alexandria</HI> by the Caravans which come from <HI>Babi∣lon.</HI> Thus much can I say at pre∣sent of the right Turbit. As for the rest, the Indians call this Wood of Aloes <HI>Aupariebou.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="104"/>
We gathered then together, in the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> store of this Wood of Aloes, which was very good and excellent: but the quantity that hath been found thereof, greater than has been hitherto seen, hath been the cause that it is not so much esteemed as formerly; yet neverthe∣less the able and learned Apotheca∣ries of <HI>Tours, Poitiers, Angiers, Ro∣chelle,</HI> and other Cities, have bought it of me at ten, fifteen, and twenty Sols the Ounce. I believe that if this Wood of Aloes of the West was dryed and cut twenty or thir∣ty years, like that of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> where the best grows, that it would very much resemble it in Virtue, Colour, and Odour: But in regard I brought it green as it was, the ignorant Apothecaries thought it was not the right Wood of Aloes.</P>
<P>But to return to this River of <HI>Ca∣yenne,</HI> there is, in the middle of it, a little Island, about 100 Paces in com∣pass, where a great number of Birds, from all parts thereabouts, come to
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
take their rest at night; and amongst others, some of those beautiful Birds have Carnation Feathers quite to the Bill: and having a mind to carry some of them alive with me into <HI>France,</HI> I strewed Bird-lime all over this little Island, (for I had brought 9 or 10 Pounds of it from <HI>France)</HI> and the next day some of our Men went there, who found a great number of them taken; But as the ill fortune would have it, they tarried not till I could see them, (for I was then in the Ship) but Eat them all up, like Gluttons as they were, which I was mightily vexed at.</P>
<P>These Birds are of the bigness of a Crane, and are at first of a Dove co∣lour, then in growing, change by lit∣tle and little into a Carnation: The Indians make their Garments of them, and Crowns of Feathers for their Heads: And it is a fine sight to see them thus array'd, painting also their Bodies with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Zinzolin, <HI>or Red the colour of the</HI> Indians.</NOTE> a reddish colour, which is that they use to Paint themselves withall: This is made of a little Seed inclosed in a Vessel of the Fashion of
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
<HI>Alquequangi,</HI> a little Plant which grows commonly in the Vinyards; They are called <HI>Coquelourdes,</HI> and are filled full with these little red Seeds, where∣with they Paint themselves.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we set these <HI>Caribes</HI> to work, and employed them in looking out the Wood of Aloes, and gave them a Hatchet or Bill for a piece or two of this Wood; and when they had prepared a piece, they came to give me notice of it, to know if it was neat, and peeled of from the white Wood which is round about it, and hath in it neither Force nor Virtue.</P>
<P>They set several Men to trail a piece of this Wood to the Sea side; for it is very heavy: Then they chose which they liked best, a Hatchet or a Bill, to exchange for their Wood. I saw one of these <HI>Caribes,</HI> who was mightily puzzel'd, and in great doubt, which of the two he should chuse, and was a long time considering and pausing with himself which would be the most necessary for him; at last,
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
after having well considered and be∣thought himself, he took the Hatchet, seeing he who gave it him began to be angry for his standing so long about it. They brought us also, to Sell, an abundance of Fruits, as Anano's and Plantins, which are long Figs, and as big as a Cervela, with Patato's, and other Things good to Eat; Also some <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cervelas.</NOTE> Crocodiles, and a sort of an Animal, armed with a Coat, which the Spa∣niards call, <HI>Armadille.</HI> I made the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Armadille</NOTE> Dissection of a Crocodile, and Eat some of it's Flesh, which is pretty good, only it is a little sweet and unsavory, though I had well Salted and Spiced it.</P>
<P>I had also in exchange, of them▪ another sort of a Creature, which is a kind of an Ape or Marmot, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Apis.</NOTE> more Arch and Roguish, and with a very long Tail.</P>
<P>The Indians say that this Beast carries her young ones upon her Back when she has cast them out of her Belly, and goes jumping from Tree to Tree with them upon her Reins;
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>
and when any one of them is ready to fall, she holds them up with her Tail.</P>
<P>This Animal makes such a noise about the Woods, that when they are together tho' never so few, you would say there were a hundred Hogs a kill∣ing.</P>
<P>That which I bought was Dead, and cost me a little Horn: It was a Female, having two Teats in the Sto∣mach like a Woman. The Indians had taken it with the Bow, and it had a stroke with an Arrow in the Belly, and carried one of her young ones upon her Back; which they brought us to Sell for a Hatchet. This little one, being in our Ship, howled after such manner, that it made us all quite Deaf; it died afterward, for it would not Eat.</P>
<P>There happened to be a Monkey at that time in our Ship, and this Crea∣ture catching fast hold about its mid∣dle, griped it so hard, that the poor Monkey could not shake it off, running about the Cordage from one side to another, and endeavouring with his Paws to make her fall, but in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="107"/>
We had another Animal, the strangest that can be imagined; for it had a very long Beard, the Head set up very high, and the Legs very long, with three Paws behind and two before: It kept it self continu∣ally in a Ball, not being able to stand upon its Legs. We tied a Rope cross the Ship, and then put this Beast up∣on it, but she continued always in a round▪ like a Ball. That which was given it to Eat, she took in her Paw like a Monkey, and so put it in her Mouth. We had many strange Creatures, which it would be too long and tedious, to give a particu∣lar account of.</P>
<P>I return then to some Manners and Fashions that I have observed amongst these <HI>Caribes.</HI> A little be∣fore our departure from this River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> we saw one day these <HI>Ca∣ribes,</HI> leading a new Bride about the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Manner of the</HI> Caribes <HI>in their Marriages.</HI></NOTE> Woods with a very great noise, and pursued and killed all that they found about the Forest. Then they came to the Sea side to see our Vessels.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="107"/>
These are People of a very good Stature, and Plump. They sat down upon the Bank of the River to view our Ship at their leisure▪ This Bride was there, all alone, with a company of these Savages, and having continued there some time to see us▪ with Ad∣miration, she again rose up▪ then the others conducted her about the Woods as before: Thus they lead about their Wives▪ their Kindred, and Friends. As I kept Watch one night upon the Deck, I saw these <HI>Caribes</HI> upon a high Mountain keeping also Watch, and Sounding with a Horn very loud; then all the other Habitations answered, in the same manner, every hour of the night▪ After that they made a clear Fire, which they presently put out again▪ They do all this that they might be thought not to Sleep; for they mightily fear their Enemies the <HI>Caripous▪</HI></P>
<P>Now our Ship being laden with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Voyage of the Author.</NOTE> as many Commodities as we were well able to procure, and being ready to set Sail, I took a Resolution, the 17th of <HI>May,</HI> to go once again towards their Habitations with some
<PB N="104" REF="108"/>
small Ware, as Knives, Combs, and other Things; and gave all these to an Indian, to carry in a little Basket, who was wonderfully pleased to fol∣low me; but he, being subtile and sly, would not march before me, say∣ing, that it did not belong to him to go first; which made me not a little wonder that this Indian could know what Honour was due to another; But, the Rascal did it, that he might the more easily put his Hand into my Basket and sharp something out; I perceived it happily, turning my self about, and so caught him in the very act; upon which I shewed him gent∣ly that <HI>that</HI> was neither handsome nor well done: He excused himself as well as he could and then went before me until he found in the Wood a little Way or Path, on the right Hand, which went straight to his Habitati∣on, and then he returned me my Bas∣ket, not being able to retain him for all I could do; I gave him a Comb, for his Labour, of which he was very glad. I do not know but that he had cast something aside of what he had taken out of my Basket.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="108"/>
I proceeded on my way untill I came to a high Mountain where there were, a great number of <HI>Caribes,</HI> with their Wives and Children: There by chance I found the Indian, our Inter∣preter, who helped me mightily in making my Bargains, for what I wanted, as well for Parrots as other kind of Animals. Having exchanged what I desir'd these Indians led me into another Habitation, where I saw, <HI>Yapoira,</HI> the Brother <HI>Caribe</HI> of <HI>Atupa</HI> who was in our Ship: He was upon <NOTE PLACE="marg">Yapoira.</NOTE> the top of one of their Houses of Palm, and as soon as he perceiv'd me, he cast himself down, and came to embrace me, remembring that <HI>I</HI> had given him a Hatchet when he had broke his own in our Service.</P>
<P>He spoke to me of his Brother <HI>A∣toupa</HI> and that his Mother had no more than this little Boy who was all her Comfort; That the <HI>Caripous</HI> had killed all his Brothers and Sisters, and that, if our General would let him return to his Mother, he himself was content to go with us into <HI>France. I</HI> told that he should go along with me, to make his Remonstrances, which
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
he did: <HI>I</HI> asked him for some Water, which they call <HI>Tonna,</HI> and presently he caused his Wife to bring me some, who was of an extraordinary sweet Nature, and very handsome, though she was stark Naked: Having drank▪ they caused me to enter into a great Hall made of Palms, where they keep themselves in the day time, with their Amaca's, to hold Counsel concern∣ing the Affairs of War. Then they led me into a certain House where there was a great many Women and Girls stark naked; and put some Pa∣tato's upon the Fire for me to Eat; and having made some exchange, as well▪ for Mace and Patato's, as Gums, which is a black Bitume which they Chaulk <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gums.</NOTE> their Cannoes with, <HI>I</HI> laded 2 or 3 Indians, and so we returned, towards the Port, to our Ship. I had a great deal of trouble in returning back be∣cause these Savages led me through the Wood where there was a great many Waters to pass; besides it rained, and was very bad Weather. After we had gone 2 or 3 Leagues of this bad way, we came to the end of a little River, and found a Cannoe on
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
Land that wanted only to be set a Float, but we had no Oars; yet these Indians looked so▪ long amongst the Herbs that at last they found out some that were hid. These Oars are very little, and like to a Battle-dore which they beat Hemp withall.</P>
<P>Being thus Embark'd, we Rowed so hard that we soon arrived at our Ship, where they waited for me with great earnestness, not knowing where I should be kept out so late, and they were to have set sail the next morn∣ing, as we did.</P>
<P>But before we come out of this Country, I will not forget, that a∣mongst other Rarities that grow there, there are certain Gums to be found, called <HI>Copal,</HI> and <HI>Anime,</HI> and certain <NOTE PLACE="marg">Animes <HI>Gums.</HI></NOTE> Bitum, or black Gum, very Odorife∣rous when it is put upon the Fire; It is also good for the Rhume, by recei∣ving the Smoak of it; the same is al∣so the <HI>Anime,</HI> which is a Gum, yellow and transparent, like the Gums of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and is found in great Tears.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Copal,</HI> it hath not this quality, but it serves for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Swellings.</NOTE> Apost∣humes, to ripen and heal them, so
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
they come from a cold Cause and Phlegm. For, as for those which come from Heat and Blood, the <HI>Copal</HI> is not so proper to apply, being it is hot. This <HI>Copal</HI> is a White Gum, en∣clining to gray: The Tree which bears it is like to a Lawrel in its Leaves, but 'tis bigger in the Trunk, and hath also young ones. I picked out some of this Gum, by making an Incision in the Tree; then the next morning, or two days after, I found the Gum pure and clear upon the slit. The <HI>Anime</HI> is gotten after the same manner, and its Tree also resembles the other. As for the Bitum, or black Gum, it comes from a place where there are Springs of Water, and it is gathered, mixed with Earth at the foot of certain Trees amongst Green Moss. The Indians make use of it, instead of Pitch, to Chalk their Can∣noes.</P>
<P>As for the Language of these Peo∣ple, I will only say, that it is of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Language of the</HI> Ca∣ribes.</NOTE> several sorts; and that of the <HI>Caripous</HI> is something different from that which the <HI>Caribes</HI> speak, and have much ado to understand other, although they are
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
not far distant. These <HI>Caribes</HI> were mighty desirous to know, of us, what it was that we Worshipped in Heaven; whether it was the Sun, which they call <HI>Occayou,</HI> or the Moon, which they name <HI>Nona,</HI> the Stars <HI>Cherica,</HI> Heaven <HI>Capa,</HI> the Clouds <HI>Canopa;</HI> as for the Fire, they call it <HI>Ovato,</HI> Water <HI>Tonna,</HI> the Sea <HI>Parano,</HI> the Woods <HI>Vropa,</HI> the Mouth <HI>Pota,</HI> the Eyes <HI>Onou,</HI> and the Hair <HI>Omchay.</HI></P>
<P>Now as for the Religion of all these <NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of these Peo∣ple.</NOTE> People of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and amongst others the <HI>Caripous</HI> and <HI>Caribes,</HI> they live without Faith and Law, and without any certain Belief of a Divinity, true or false; not Worshipping Idols, nor any thing whatsoever: only they be∣lieve some kind of an Immortality of the Soul. They speak much of a God, which they call <HI>Toupan,</HI> which is some <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caribes <HI>deal with the Devil</HI> Toupan.</NOTE> Devil with whom they have Familia∣rity, and exercise several sorts of Di∣vination and Witchcraft: And I re∣member we were told that when <HI>Camaria,</HI> King of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> had a mind to know any thing concerning their Wars against their Enemies, he made made a hole in the Ground, pro∣nouncing
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
some certain Words, and then came something up with a horrible thundering noise, which spake to him, and instructed him, giving him no∣tice what their Enemies were doing at that▪time. And indeed, when <HI>Ca∣maria</HI> and his Brother <HI>Yago</HI> came on board our Ship, they told us, that they knew very well, that their Enemy <HI>Anacajoury,</HI> King of the <HI>Caripous,</HI> was preparing himself to come to attack them; that which he could not have known so readily but by such means.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Caripou-Yapoco,</HI> of whom I have spoken before, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Yapoco.</NOTE> <HI>Camaria</HI> King of the <HI>Caribes</HI> had in∣stantly desired me (being at his Ha∣biration) to order the business so with our General that he might have him in his power, to Eat him in Revenge of the mischief that his Uncle <HI>Anaca∣joury</HI> had done them before: VVhen I was returned back to our Ship, I spoke to the General about it, who told me, that I did very well to pro∣mise, but he would take care to avoid such VVickedness: Thus <HI>Camaria</HI> was promised to have <HI>Yapoco</HI> given him, of which he was mighty Joyful, and sent
<PB N="111" REF="111"/>
about all his Country, to all his Friends and Confederates that they should pre∣pare themselves to come to this Feast. The next morning hoising our Sails, and weighing Anchor to go away, presently comes <HI>Camaria</HI> with a great many Indians to have <HI>Yapoco,</HI> who be∣ing refused him in good earnest, went away so affronted and vexed that I had not a mind to return to be his Guest; for I believe they would have done the same to me they designed to do to the poor▪ <HI>Yapoco.</HI> This <HI>Ca∣maria</HI> had but one Eye, and was mighty Crafty and Treacherous.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Yapoira,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Atou∣pa</HI> the <HI>Caribe,</HI> who had tarried all night in our Ship as I have said be∣fore: <HI>Atoupa</HI> did all that ever he could to persuade us to let go his Brother▪ but seeing he could not obtain that of our General, he said that he would also willingly go with us into <HI>France,</HI> and that he would either kill or drown himself rather than leave him. The General told him that he was con∣tent, and that he should come betimes in the morning, and whilst he was in such a good Humour: This being
<PB N="112" REF="112"/>
thus resolved upon, as soon as we be∣gan to set sail, we saw the Mother of these two <HI>Caribes,</HI> who came towards us in a Cannoe, crying and howling after the most pittiful manner that could be imagined; She brought along with her the Bow and Arrows, the Paintings and the Amica, of <HI>Yapoira,</HI> which is all their Wealth. <HI>Yapoira</HI> was mighty sorry to see his Mother keep such a mourning for him, and desired our General to give her a Hatchet, to appease her a little, which was done; yet she returned again thus Disconso∣late.</P>
<P>After that we set sail the 18th of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Departure from the Country of the</HI> Cari∣bes.</NOTE> <HI>May,</HI> and passed by a little Island, very pleasant, near to the Coast of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> holding our Course to go to the Isle of <HI>Santea-Lucia,</HI> but we <NOTE PLACE="marg">Santa-Lu∣cia.</NOTE> were deceived by the Currents which come from the South-East, having made (according to the Estimation of our Pilot) in one night, above seventy Leagues, without scarce any Wind. We went to touch at the Isle of <HI>Tabuco,</HI> which remained Northwards of us. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tabaco <HI>Isle.</HI></NOTE> Then, leaving the Isle <HI>de-la-Trinadad</HI> towards the South, we discovered <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isle</HI> de la Trinadad</NOTE>

the Testigues of the Isle <HI>Blanche,</HI> which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Blanche-Isle.</NOTE> are 5 or 6 Peninsula's, very near to one another, and passed through the middle of them, then seeing Land of some places above: We were a long time conside∣ring if it was Land, or thick Clouds, because it was very low; and there∣upon several Wagers were laid, whe∣ther it was Land or not: At last, bearing directly towards it, we found out that it was really Land, but un∣known to us, since deceived by the Currents.</P>
<P>As we approached it, we saw Ani∣mals, running in great Companies <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild-Goats.</NOTE> along the Coast: Some of us not know∣ing what they were, said at first they were Bands or Cavalliers; but these Cavalliers proved to be Wild-Goats, of which this Isle is full: Taking down then our Sails very low we went as near to this Island as we could, our Patache going continually before to discover if there were any Rocks, as indeed we had gone directly upon one had not the Patache given us no∣tice thereof with a signal at the end of a Pike, and took the way that she shewed us, leaving this Rock about
<PB N="114" REF="113"/>
a little Stones cast off us: It was not covered with above a Foot or two of Water, so that we going so swift with a light Gale of Wind, had without doubt split, and been all lost in such a place without help or succour; and besides, it being in the night; but God by his mercy preserved us there from; and being there was not much clear Water to be seen, we could not find the bottom to Anchor, but at last we found but 30 Fathoms of Water, where we cast Anchor for this night.</P>
<P>The next morning the 29th of <HI>May</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Voyage into the Isle.</NOTE> we caused our Boat to be Equipped to go on Shore, and to seek some Water: Our Men after Breakfast, went thus away, with their Muskets and Pikes, without the least drop of Water along with them; but they payed dear for it: For after having gone a good way up into this Island, with the heat of the Sun and running after the Goats, they were so wonderful dry and thirsty that, they thought, they should all have Died for want of a little Water; and returning again with great Trouble and Fatigue, they were forced to carry the weakest upon their Shoul∣ders:
<PB N="115" REF="113"/>
They brought along with them a great many Pelicans, and coming confusedly one after another very weak and discomforted, and not minding any thing but Drinking; and then our General's Brother of Friendship coming on board our Ship, said aloud, that they looked for Pearls, but he had rather have a Barrel of Water, than of Pearls, for the great Thirst that he had endured with the rest.</P>
<P>The next morning we went (sixteen <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author visites the Isle.</NOTE> Men) to discover the other side of the Island, and if there was any Water; and coming on Land we saw before us a great number of Wild-goats, who came running along the Sea side, and began to enter into a Valley, where we with Harquebuss and Mus∣ket killed five or six upon the place. These Creatures, not being used to be Hunted after this manner, made a horrible noise and bellowing; and though they were Shot quit through the Body, yet they did not fall for that, but fled away with a light pace. We left there a Man to order these we had killed. I never thought then to look for the Besoart-Stone, which these <NOTE PLACE="marg">Besoart-Stone.</NOTE>
<PB N="116" REF="114"/>
Beasts carry in their Ventricle, but to follow the others about this Isle to find out Water, and some curious Things.</P>
<P>We went thus three or four Leagues without finding any Water, at which our Companions were mightily asto∣nished, and deceived as well as those the day before: For we had nothing at all to quench our Thirst, amidst such excessive heat of the Sun: As for me, I had carried in my Pocket a Coco's or Palm-Nut, full of Liquor, which was no small help to me at this time, and I believe without that, I should had much ado to have returned. Our Carpenter was forced to stay be∣hind, earnestly desiring me to tarry with him; But it was not my inten∣tion to lie in these Desarts; besides, the Ship was to set Sail the next morn∣ing, which gave me the more courage to return the same day. After ha∣ving thus rambled about, and run from one side to the other, at last we came under a great Tree, where we sat down in the Shade to take our rest. And as it is certain that there is no better Remedy to quench the Thirst
<PB N="117" REF="114"/>
than Sleeping, all our Men who were a little harrassed and fatigued, as much with Thirst, as by the way, and ha∣ving run after the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A sort of Spanish Kid.</NOTE> <HI>Cabrettes,</HI> fell pre∣sently a Sleep: But I not being at all sleepy, laid down upon my Back, with my Face upwards to suck in the Air; and upon this I espied a great Lizard, full and very high, the Tail very long, and about the bigness of a Cat; I <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hunting of the</HI> Lizards</NOTE> presently rose up without awakening our Men, and having taken a Pike, I gave the branch of the Tree there∣with such a blow, that there tumbled down two of them, which the In∣dians call <HI>Gouyana's.</HI> I run after them <NOTE PLACE="marg">Guyana's <HI>or</HI> Li∣zards.</NOTE> trailing along my Pike, which broke in two pieces, and made such haste that I overtook one which was creep∣ing under a Rock, and I took it by the Tail, plucking it with all my force; but it being very strong, stretched it self in such a manner against me, ha∣ving very long Paws, that it saved its Body, but the Tail remained in my Hands, and was alive above three hours after, continually moving. As soon as our Men were awake, I gave them an account of what had hap∣pened,
<PB N="118" REF="115"/>
and made so many Courses about this Island, that I caught two of these Lizards, whereof I made ve∣ry good chear, for the Flesh thereof is pretty good; I kept their Skins to carry away with me. This Crea∣ture is of a very hard Life, for after having taken, and leaving them for Dead, yet they from time to time come to move and start up, so that carrying them in a Napkin, I thought to let them fall every moment. After we had reposed our selves a little un∣der this Tree, we took our way to∣wards the other side of the Sea, find∣ing a little beaten Path which went towards these <HI>Cabrettes,</HI> thinking that it was the way, where they went to look for Water to Drink; but after having gone about a League of this way, we found in a flat ground, a great place where these <HI>Cabrettes</HI> came to take their rest, for the place was mightily beaten. We saw there another Path which went from this place; and hoping that it would lead us to some Water, we found it brought us to the Sea-side, where we saw some Sea-Water upon a Rock, which was
<PB N="119" REF="115"/>
high and flat; it made us glad, think∣ing it had been fresh, but tasting of it we found the contrary, and that it was nothing but the Waves of the Sea which broke against this Rock, where there always remains some little of it, besides the Sun had Congeled it into Salt exceeding clear and pure. Seeing then that we found no Water, it behoved us (tho' with great regret) to take again the way to our Ship, each one seeking the nearest he could, for we went confu∣sedly, striving who might arrive first to quench his Thirst; but the allow∣ance we had was not sufficient, not being more than a little Cupfull of Drink, which was sower Citter, with two parts Water, but some had pro∣vided Liquor for themselves.</P>
<P>I arrived the third at the Ship, and Bathed my Body in the Sea to refresh my self, sopping also a little Bisket in the Sea to Eat, and swallowing some Mouth-fulls thereof. The rest of our Men were tarried behind, and being come there with the Fleming and Scotchman, we called the Boat<HI>:</HI> But the Ship being above a League and a
<PB N="120" REF="116"/>
half from Land, which was a great hinderance to us; for the Boat would not carry us back without the others, who were still far enough off, and kept one another up by the Arms; But at last I persuaded the Mariners to carry me on Board, where, as soon as I came, I went to visit my Chest and my Bottle, and remained full three days without being able to quench my Thirst: The rest of our Men re∣turned very late, and were wonderful weary and fatigued; But the poor Carpenter tarried behind to keep com∣pany with the Cabrettes, Lizards, and Parrots, who were there in abun∣dance, and very beautiful. Our Ge∣neral seeing that he was wanting, said, he would not part from the Road un∣til he had News of him; and sent Seamen all the Night, with the Trum∣pet <NOTE PLACE="marg">Adven∣tures of the Car∣penter.</NOTE> to Sound all about the Island to call him, but all to no purpose, for he was far enough from thence. The morning being come, his Seamen was commanded to take a Shovel, with other Mariners who knew pretty nigh the place where they had left him, and went thus seeking about these Desarts,
<PB N="121" REF="116"/>
(for it is a flat Island having very few Trees:) At last they found him trail∣ing along his Musket as well as he could; for he was very Sick, and be∣ing come to the Ship, he was taken with a Fever, accompanied with a Frenzie, continuing 3 or 4 days, and did nothing but cry out for Drink, and it was almost impossible to satis∣fie him: He told us afterwards how he had lain under a Tree quite full of Parrots, which he could easily take with his Hand; and that the <HI>Cabrettes</HI> came to smell upon him in the night time; but that he never stirred from his Musket which he always kept close by him: The moisture of the night had a little quenched his Thirst; He was also forced to Drink his own Water.</P>
<P>Being parted from this Isle the first of <HI>June,</HI> to go to the <HI>Margueritta,</HI> as we were under Sail very late at night, we descry'd two Ships coming full sail upon us. We had sunk our Patache in this Desart Island. We got the Wind a little upon them, and being very near one to the other, their Trumpets began to Sound, and ours
<PB N="122" REF="117"/>
to answer them. As we were prepa∣red to receive them, having put out our Cannons, and ready to come to handy Strokes, the Wind being very savourable for us, and the night very dark, they would not come on board without having first known who we were. We got the Wind of them as much as we could, and in the end, du∣ring the dark and stormy night, we escaped, and made towards the Isle of <HI>Margueritta,</HI> where we arrived the next day towards the Evening, and cast <NOTE PLACE="marg">Margue∣rite <HI>Island.</HI></NOTE> Anchor near to a little Habitation on the East-side: Then we sent our Boat on Land, with Arms, to discover the place: They found Fire still in the Houses, but no Body within, all be∣ing fled into the Woods at the sight of us. We found a Cannoe, which came from Fishing of Pearls, not ha∣ving any thing in it but Shells. The Master's Mate was sent to a rising Ground in the Island, to see if he could discover any thing: He espied 3 or 4 Blacks, who run away into the *Thorn-Bushes as soon as they saw him, and it was impossible to find <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> them out, tho' very diligent search was
<PB N="123" REF="117"/>
made: We had a great mind to take some one of the Islanders to shew us the place where they Fish for Pearls, which is in certain places along by the Isle; but it was impossible to find any one of them.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>June</HI> in the night time we had so violent a Tempest, that our Ship was in danger to have run a∣ground, but leaving an Anchor in the Sea to save the Ship, we were preserved from this imminent danger.</P>
<P>The fourth day of the same month, seeing we could not find any sweet Water, we weighed our Anchors and bore towards <HI>Cumana,</HI> and arriving 2 or 3 Leagues on this side, we perceiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cumana.</NOTE> a Fleming Ship in a Bay or Gulf, lading with Bay-Salt, which is there in abun∣dance<HI>:</HI> We cast Anchor on the Star∣board-side of her, and put out our Boat into the Sea to Board them, and so to ask them where we might find some fresh Water. After having saluted us with their Cannon, they told us, that bearing towards the River of <HI>Cumana</HI> we should find some, and that we should by the way meet their Shalop, which they had sent there▪
<PB N="124" REF="118"/>
which we did accordingly, but the Men therein would come near us by no means, they were so afraid needlesly. We continued our Course towards <HI>Cumana,</HI> where coming near the River, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Extream Thirst.</NOTE> we espied along the Coast two Ships at Anchor, not knowing what they should be▪ Nevertheless we proceeded on, for it was necessary to have Water, and could not live without Drinking. We found that of these two Ships the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>encounter with the English.</NOTE> one was a Fleming, and the other English: The Fleming Traffick'd there underhand with those of <HI>Cumana,</HI> where the Spaniards are; And the English Patache came there to seek some fresh Water for their Admiral, whom she had left along by the <HI>Margueritta</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>After several Guns for Salutation, the English came on Board our Ship, Feasting our English Pilot and 5 or 6 others of their Countrymen which we had in our Ship.</P>
<P>Our Trumpeter shewed me their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange History of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Pilot, and told me, that he some years before being in an English Vessel, as they were upon the Coasts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> towards <HI>St. John de Love,</HI> (the
<PB N="125" REF="118"/>
first place of the <HI>Indies</HI> to go to <HI>Mexi∣co,</HI> where the Spaniards are, then their Sworn Enemies) a great Storm over∣took them, which cast them upon the Coast, where they were all lost, ex∣cept this Pilot, who saved himself by Swiming to Land, carrying with him a little Sea-Compass, and went thus wandring about to return by Land to the <HI>Newfound</HI> Countries: Upon that, he had found an Indian-Woman, of whom he was Enamoured, making her fine Promises by Signs, that he would Marry her; which she belie∣ved, and conducted him through these Desarts; where she shewed him the Fruit and Roots good to Eat, and served him for an Interpreter amongst the Indians, which he found, she tell∣ing them that it was her Husband. After having been thus 2 or 3 years continually wandering about, and that for above 800 Leagues, without any other Comfort but this Woman: At last they arrived at the <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> guiding himself by his Compass: They had a Child together; and found there an English Ship a Fishing: He was very glad to see himself escaped
<PB N="126" REF="119"/>
from so many Dangers, and gave these English an account of all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Adventures: They took him on Board their Vessel to make him good chear; but being ashamed to take along with him this Indian-Woman thus Naked, he left her on Land, without regard∣ing her any more: But she seeing her self thus forsaken by him, whom she had so dearly Loved, and for whose sake she had abandonned her Country and Friends, and had so well guided and accompanied him through such places, where he would, without her, have been dead a thousand times▪ After having made some Lamentation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange and Cruel Acts of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> full of Rage and Anger, she took her Child, and tearing it into two pieces, she cast the one half towards him into the Sea, as if she would say, that belonged to him, and was his part of it; and the other she carried away with her, returning back to the Mercy of Fortune, and full of Mourn∣ing and Discontent.</P>
<P>The Seamen who took this Pilot into their Boat, seeing this horrible and cruel Spectacle, asked him, why he had left this Woman; but he pre∣tended
<PB N="127" REF="119"/>
she was a Savage, and that he did not now heed her; which was an extream Ingratitude and Wicked∣ness in him: Hearing this, I could not look upon him, but always with Horrour and great Detestation.</P>
<P>After then that we had Feasted one another, the English Convoyed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Water found.</NOTE> us to get some Water: All the night long, I went to Drink in full Streams, to compense the former Thirst I en∣dur'd, filling the empty Vessels of my Chest for the time to come. In the morning before we set Sail, two Spaniards, with an Indian-Woman, came from <HI>Cumana,</HI> on Board, to exchange Pearls with some of our Merchandize, but we had nothing fit for them: We weighed then our Anchors, and took our Course the 5th of <HI>June,</HI> and repassing along by the Isle of <HI>Margueritta,</HI> and the White Island, we went to get out of the Channel by the <HI>Virginies:</HI> But ha∣ving <NOTE PLACE="marg">Virginia.</NOTE> seen there a great Ship at An∣chor, we could not imagine what she should be, whether English or Spanish; we passed close by her, without perceiving any one upon the
<PB N="128" REF="120"/>
Deck; And bearing a little further, we perceived a great Ship, in form of a Galley, coming full sail upon us▪ We kept our selves to the Wind as much as we could, nevertheless we were prepared to receive them; but the night coming on, when they were near us, and at such time when we thought to come to handy-Blows, this great Ship that we had left at Anchor made a Fire on Land, which made them leave of Chasing us. We bore all night along by <HI>Portorico,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Portorico.</NOTE> the next day, at night, the 12th of <HI>July</HI> passed all the Island: We saw our selves at break of day out of the Channel, and very joyful that▪ we were in the Main-Sea, holding our Course about the height of the Isle of <HI>Bermuda.</HI> We had tarried a long time without making any way, be∣cause <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bermude-Isle.</NOTE> of the Calms: And visiting our Bread, and finding it very short, we were forced to come to parting, and my part fell to about 8 or 10 pound, as well good as mouldy; But having a great many Parrots to feed, I was in perplexity what to do, being this Animal is very Glut∣tonous.
<PB N="129" REF="120"/>
At last, I was resolved to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kill the greediest, and Rost him, which I did, and Eat him up before I came to want more Bisquet. In the mean time, seeing the Wind was not fa∣vourable for us, we began already to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Extream Council.</NOTE> hold Council; that if this Weather continued any longer, we should be constrained to cast Lots, who should Eat his Companion.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE TRAVELS AND VOYAGES OF John Mocquet, INTO <HI>MOROCCO,</HI> And other Places of <HI>AFRICA.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>BOOK III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Voyage that I had made the former year to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> had left me such a de∣sire to see also the rest of the World, that I was resolved to go to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> if I found any fit opportunity: For this effect, I parted from <HI>Paris</HI> the 12th of <HI>April</HI> 1605. and taking
<PB N="140" REF="126"/>
my way straight to <HI>Britagne,</HI> I went to Embark at <HI>St. Lezer, (St. Nazare)</HI> in a Ship of <HI>Poligain,</HI> where we were not above twenty Persons in all.</P>
<P>We were at the beginning of this Voyage so beaten with contrary Winds, that we were forced to the Coast of <HI>Galice,</HI> a little below Cape <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vere.</HI> Having continued there for some time, we set sail with the Wind, and arrived at <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> at such time as they were Rejoycing for the Birth of an Infant of <HI>Spain;</HI> which was a very fine sight. For after ha∣ving <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rejoycing at</HI> Lisbon.</NOTE> a long time run the Bulls, accor∣ding to their manner of Pastime, where there was a great many Horses maimed, and Cavalliers overturned <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lamed.</NOTE> to the Ground, they laded a Bull with Crackers, but there was such a great number of them on him, that he fell down under the Burthen; and they were forced to fetch a strong Ox to carry them, and yet he stoop'd under so heavy a Load: These Crackers were fastened one to another, so that they covered all the Body of this Ox; then there was others tied to his Horns. When the Feast was ended, fire was
<PB N="141" REF="126"/>
put to these Crackers, and then you would have said, that the Ox flew in the Air, with such an Impetuosity, which looked like Lightning; for Ten Thousand Muskets would not have made so great a noise, each Cracker answering one another, so that the Ox remained quite roasted.</P>
<P>I made some stay at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> upon the hopes that I should, (as I have said) <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dutch Ar∣my towards</HI> Lisbon.</NOTE> find passage to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> if the Fleet had gone there that year: But as it was ready to part, the Dutch Fleet came to cast Anchor about the Bar of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where they stayed a long time, waiting for the said Fleet; but the Portuguese were not so foolish as to venture out. After that, Don <HI>Louis Fajardo,</HI> General of the Army, knowing that the Hollanders were now retired, riged out a Fleet of 35 sail to follow after; and went a good way out into the Sea, sending a little Ship before, called the <HI>Pearl,</HI> (taken from the <HI>Rochellers)</HI> to discover'em; But this Vessel meeting with the Hollanders, was taken by them, and all the rest returned to the Haven of <HI>Lisbon</HI> without doing any thing.
<PB N="142" REF="127"/>
Having then lost this occasion of passing to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> at that time, I was resolved to go to <HI>Barbary,</HI> and for this Cause Embarked at <HI>Cascais,</HI> in a Vessel belonging to Captain <HI>Poul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> of <HI>Rochelle.</HI></P>
<P>We bore South East, and passed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Voyage in∣to</HI> Barba∣ry.</NOTE> along by <HI>Azamor,</HI> near to the City of <HI>Lions,</HI> which is a place ruined, having still very high Towers. On Wednesday the 8th day of the month, we cast Anchor in the Road of <HI>Saffy,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saffy.</NOTE> where I tarried some time without going on Shore at all: But <HI>Cidi-Hamet Talbe,</HI> or Secretary to the King of <HI>Morocco, Mulei-Boufairs</HI> being come to <HI>Saffy</HI> with his <HI>Almahalle,</HI> or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Alma∣halle.</NOTE> little Army, to conduct the Caravan which was come to <HI>Morocco,</HI> and to reconduct the other, which was go∣ing there, he sell Sick; and having heard that there was a <HI>Tabibe,</HI> or a Physitian on board our Ship, he sent some Moors immediately to fetch me. I went with them on Land, not knowing what they would do with me; and coming there upon the Port, I found this <HI>Cidi-Hamet</HI> sitting with a great number of Moors along the
<PB N="143" REF="127"/>
Walls of the Castle; and as soon as he saw me, he rose up, and taking me by the Hand, led me into his Camp, which was without <HI>Saffy,</HI> in∣to his Tent, being very fine, and curiously Embroidered with Figures, after the Moresque. There I found a Jew, which served for Interpreter in the <HI>Gemique,</HI> (which is Spanish or corrupted Portuguese) which I un∣derstood; and having discoursed with me about his Disease, I resolved upon that which I thought best for his Cure; and for this cause went on board our Ship to look for Drugs fit for this purpose.</P>
<P>In short, I Purged him so, that I caused him to Vomit up Worms like little Serpents; which made me not a little admire, for they were so very great, and long, that it was almost impossible to imagine that such odious and horrible things could be in Human Bodies: Since that, he was very well and was my great Friend; and he and his <HI>Alcades</HI> shewed me all the kindness imaginable: He gave me a Horse to go to <HI>Morocco,</HI> making very much of me by the way.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="128"/>
Thus we parted from <HI>Saffy</HI> to go to <HI>Morocco,</HI> the 28th of <HI>August,</HI> and went to pitch the <HI>Almahalle</HI> near to the <HI>Adouars</HI> or Tents of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and went to see them with some Moors their Enemies. These <HI>Ara∣bians</HI> caused us to enter into their Tents; then they put some Carpets▪ very thick and hairy upon the Ground for us to sit upon, and brought us some Camels Milk to Drink, with I don't know what other things: After that, we retired in the night to the Camp of the Moors, which was not very far from thence.</P>
<P>The next morning we raised our Tents, and went to pitch the <HI>Alma∣halle</HI> at the <HI>Duguele,</HI> were there is Water. The <HI>Arabians</HI> had made there a great many large and deep Ditches, which they call <HI>Matamores,</HI> in such manner that it is a very dreadful thing to look to the bottom of them: 'Tis there they find Water; in some of which there is some, in others none: And these <HI>Arabs</HI> come to look there for VVater, above 4 or 5 Leagues round about. From the <HI>Puquelle</HI> they come with their Camels, which
<PB N="145" REF="128"/>

And when they have Reaped their Corn, they raise their <HI>Adouars,</HI> or Tents, and go away to some other place far distant from thence, leaving this Ground to lie waste a long time<HI>:</HI> Then afterwards, they return there again, laying their Houses and Husbandry, VVives and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arabians, <HI>and their manner of Living.</HI></NOTE> Children, upon their Camels, like as the antient <HI>Nomades,</HI> and the <HI>Tartar Hordes,</HI> at this day, and go altogether in a Company, by <HI>Cabilles</HI> or Gene∣rations; so that if any one comes to strike one of their Generation, they think themselves all thereby injured, and presently Revenge it.

Respect, as I have seen in their <HI>Alcayde-Abdassis,</HI> Captain of one of these <HI>Cabilles,</HI> which conducted us from <HI>Morocco</HI> to <HI>Saffy,</HI> to hinder those of his <HI>Cabille</HI> from doing us any pre∣judice, for he had taken us in his Custody upon his Head, having so promised it to the King of <HI>Morocco;</HI> forasmuch as his People held a good part of the way betwixt <HI>Morocco</HI> and <HI>Saffy.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to our Voyage; the morning being come, we raised the Tents, and in waiting till the Camels were Laded, the <HI>Cavaliers, Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> exercised themselves at the Lance: And there was, amongst o∣thers, a young <HI>Alcayde,</HI> who took his Course with his Lance against me, crying out to me in his Language, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Senari <HI>Christian.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bara, bara, aben senari,</HI> which is to say, Guard thy self, thou Son of a Chri∣stian▪ I spurr'd then my Horse, which was a <HI>Barbe,</HI> very nimble, having two Pistols at my Saddle-bow, I ran at the Re-incountre with this <HI>Cavalier;</HI> but my Horse being strong in the Mouth, was very near Precipitating me to the bottom of these <HI>Matamores,</HI> or Pits of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mata∣mores.</NOTE>
<PB N="147" REF="129"/>
Water, which I have spoken of; for the Mouth of them are hid amongst the Grass, and they are there in great numbers: But seeing my self almost upon the brink, and my Horse going to leap to the other side (which he could never have done without loosing us both:) I reined him so to the pur∣pose, that if the <HI>Alcayde,</HI> which exer∣cised with me, had▪ not also stopped, seeing me so near this Precipice, I had infallibly tumbled therein, but never come out again entirely; considering their great and horrible Depth.</P>
<P>When I saw my self delivered from this danger, I praised God, and re∣tired as far as I could from thence, leaving these <HI>Moors</HI> to exercise by themselves, not knowing so well as they, where these <HI>Matamores</HI> are, so dangerous to those who are not aware of them.</P>
<P>After that we Travelled all the rest of this Day, and endured extream Heats until toward Evening, then we pitched our Tents along by some Wa∣ter, where all these <HI>Arabs</HI> cast them∣selves to wash, and refresh 'em, at which I was not a little vexed, for
<PB N="148" REF="130"/>
I had a great mind to drink of this Water, all muddy and dirty as it was, and besides a little faltish, yet I was forced to Drink thereof. We pitched then in these Desarts, and the next <NOTE PLACE="marg">Desarts without Waters.</NOTE> day, early in the Morning we depart∣ed, Travelling all the Day in the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> the greatest that can be possibly imagined, in these Fields Scorched and Burnt, because of the Hot Winds which blew after such a manner, that we were ready to Die with Thirst<HI>:</HI> At last, we came into a Des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt, where we were forced to look for Water a far off. There was there the <HI>Adouars</HI> of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Adouars.</NOTE> helped us to some Refreshments of water and Camels Milk, which is not very sweet, but of a strange tast to those who are not accustomed to it; but necessity makes every thing to seem Good, as I have often experienced in all my Voyages.</P>
<P>The next morning going on our way, we perceived several <HI>Arabs</HI> with their Camels laden with Corn, who came to joyn with us, to go to <HI>Mo∣rocco.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="130"/>
We met also great Numbers of <HI>Arabians</HI> on Horse-back with their Launces, who came about us to salute their chief <HI>Abdassis,</HI> and others of their kindred who were in our Company; I saw them come with great Humili∣ty to kiss the Hands of their General <HI>Abdassis</HI> who had Govern'd them a long time.</P>
<P>I went always in their Company, leaving the other Troops behind, for the desire I had, by following them, to get some Water of the <HI>Arabs</HI> their Friends, whom we found encamped in a Valley of the Desarts; for we went continually with so excessive a Heat, that I durst not so much as lift▪ up my Eyes▪ Going thus, we met at the bottom of a Mountain some <HI>Arabian</HI> Shepherds, who kept Flocks of Sheep, Goats, and Cam∣els: We went with a number of Cavalliers towards them, to know where we might find some Water, but they would not shew us: Here∣upon one of these <HI>Arabs,</HI> who came a long with us▪ commanded one of these Shephards to give him his Stick; and having it in his Hands, began to
<PB N="150" REF="131"/>
beat these poor Wretches with such <NOTE PLACE="marg">Water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> fury, that I was very sorry to see it, although I was also very Thirsty. This Savage Treatment made the Shepherds shew us where their <HI>A∣douars</HI> were, about a League from thence; where we went with all diligence, and found there one of these <HI>Arabs,</HI> who came to fetch Water far from thence, in a Goat-Skin. This Water was very Salt and hot; yet every one of these Cavalliers cast themselves thereupon, for it was very little for so many Men. I obliged them so, with Money, that I obtained some of one of these <HI>Arabs</HI> where we were come. Truly it seemed, that they bereaved these poor▪ Wretches of their Lives in taking away their Water they come to look for so far, and besides there is but little to be found, the Weather being so exces∣sive hot; for all their <HI>Matamores</HI> were dried up at that time.</P>
<P>Having a little refreshed our selves, we went to rejoyn the Camp of the <HI>Almahalle,</HI> and pitched our Tents near the River <HI>Tensif,</HI> a little days Journey from <HI>Morocco.</HI> We met a great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tensif <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver.</NOTE>
<PB N="151" REF="131"/>
many <HI>Arabians</HI> all on Horseback, with their Launces, who came about us, to Salute their General <HI>Abdassis,</HI> and others of their Friends, who were in our Company.</P>
<P>I saw them again come with great Humility to Kiss the Hands of this their Chief, <HI>Abdassis,</HI> as before. There we quenched our Thirst a little with this Water; though it was very hot. All the Land in these Countries is various, some part good, and others bad, but for the most part Inculti∣vated, except that which is near some Water, which they Till. This River <HI>Tensif</HI> Breeds the most excellent Trouts of any in the World, being very little, and their Flesh red, but of an excellent Taste, and are mighti∣ly esteemed at <HI>Morocco.</HI></P>
<P>The next morning, going a little <NOTE PLACE="marg">Morocco.</NOTE> further, we discovered <HI>Morocco,</HI> in a great Campagne; and this City seems to be situated near to Mount <NOTE PLACE="marg">Atlas <HI>Mountain.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Atlas,</HI> though it is above 7 Leagues distant: VVe found by the way some Christians, who came about us.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="132"/>
These are People that Traffick there, and when they hear that any other Christians come with the <HI>Casile,</HI> they are very glad, and meet them by the way: They bring with them a little Mule laden with Victuals. Now the most part of the Christians of this <HI>Casile</HI> were English, Prisoners, with Irons upon their Feet, and had been <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>English Prisoners at</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> Arrested at <HI>Saffy,</HI> upon the account of an <HI>Alcayde</HI> named <HI>Abdelacinthe,</HI> who was a Portuguese by▪ Nation, but a Renegado▪ And for his Capacity and VVorth, he had given him the Com∣mand of the <HI>Casile</HI> who returned from <HI>Morocco</HI> to <HI>Saffy,</HI> with about 500 Soldiers under his Charge.</P>
<P>Now it happened by chance, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abdela∣cinthe, <HI>and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to him.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Antonio de Soldaigne,</HI> and <HI>Petro Caesar,</HI> Portuguese Gentlemen, had been both taken at <HI>Tangier</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> and brought to <HI>Morocco,</HI> and being there detained Captives 13 or 14 years, until such time that they were Released by the Sieur <HI>de l' Isle,</HI> a Physitian, and at that time Agent there for King <HI>Henry the Great.</HI> As these two Portugueses were returning in liberty, this <HI>Alcayde, Abdelacinthe,</HI> had Negotiated with

them to save himself in their Vessel wherein they were to Embark. For this cause, he went to Pitch his <HI>Alma∣halle</HI> towards the place where they come to take Water for the Ships, near to the Cape of <HI>Cantin;</HI> and be∣ing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cape of</HI> Cantin.</NOTE> there one night, he told his Men, that he had caused a Moorish-Woman to be brought him, with whom he desired to speak in Secret, a good way off from the Camp, and took none along with him but a Slave of his: When he was near to the Sea-side, he fired a Fuzee, which was the signal that he had given to those of the Ship. As soon as they heard this, presently the People of Boat (who were hid in the Bushes) came to seize upon his Person, and took him, and carried him away in their Vessel, by which means he saved himself. The Slave fled to the <HI>Almahalle,</HI> to give them notice of the taking of his Master, at which they were mightily astonished, and presently retired to <HI>Saffy:</HI> But as the People of an English Boat at the same time were come on Shore for some things they had then occasion for, they were Arrested, and had Irons

clapt upon their Feet, as I saw them in the Castle of <HI>Saffy,</HI> in very poor Equipage, and were since carried to <HI>Morocco,</HI> where the Merchants paid for them, I don't know how many Ounces of Gold, which was very near the Ransom of the <HI>Alcayde Abdalacinthe</HI> who had escap'd: For those Kings will not loose any thing, it being the Custom at <HI>Marocco,</HI> that when a Slave runs away, all the others as∣semble together and pay for him, cau∣tioning one another to go freely about <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cautioning of the Slaves at</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> the City without Irons; which is meant of the poorer sort: But as for the Rich, they are put into the <HI>Si∣sane,</HI> which is the Kings great Prison, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sisane.</NOTE> where they are well guarded, as these two Portuguese Gentlemen vvere of vvhom I have already spoken.</P>
<P>To return to the Christians of <HI>Morocco,</HI> who met us by the way, they made us very good chear, in a Garden, along by a pleasant Water running some two Leagues from <HI>Mo∣rocco.</HI> The <HI>Almahalle</HI> entered not into <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrival at</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> <HI>Morocco</HI> this day, but I left it where it was pitched, and went to lie within the City, in the House of the Christi∣ans,

paying for my entrance to the <HI>Talbe</HI> or Register; This was the 2d of <HI>September</HI> 1606. As soon as I was arrived, I failed not to go visit the Sieur <HI>de l'Isle,</HI> Physitian, who was lodged in a very fine House in the <HI>Juderie,</HI> or Jews-Place. The Sieur <HI>de l'Isle</HI> was a long time near to the Person of the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> in Qua∣lity of an Agent, for our King <HI>Henry the Great;</HI> And there had been since sent the Sieur <HI>Hubert,</HI> the King's Phy∣sitian, in the room of the Sieur <HI>de l'Isle;</HI> Then both went into <HI>France,</HI> but since that, the said Sieur <HI>de l'Isle</HI> returned there again. The Sieur <HI>Hubert</HI> lived about a year at <HI>Morocco,</HI> practising Physick near the King, and there following his principal design, that is, the Learning the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue; so that since he rendered himself very expert therein, as he hath made pub∣lick Profession thereof at <HI>Paris</HI> it self, with great Solemnity<HI>:</HI> He contented himself to depart out of this Country more laden with Science and <HI>Arabick</HI> Books, than with Riches, or any Commodities, in which the Sieur <HI>de l'Isle</HI> was more happy than he.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="134"/>
Being then in the <HI>Juderie,</HI> I was there conducted by a Jew, who Cozened me of some Rials, giving me falsly to understand, that I was to pay some at the Door of this place, where we were to enter; and indeed he brought one, who came to demand it, and I was forced to Content them.</P>
<P>This <HI>Juderie,</HI> or Jews-Place, is above <NOTE PLACE="marg">Juderie <HI>of</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> a good League from the <HI>Douane,</HI> where the Christians inhabit; and near the King's Palace; and is like a City by it self, encompassed with good Walls, having but one Gate guarded by the Moors<HI>:</HI> It may be as big as <HI>Meaux.</HI> There the Jews inhabit, to the num∣ber of above 4000, and pay Tribute: There is also some Christians; And in this place also live the Agents and Am∣bassadors of strange Princes: As for the rest of the Christians Trafficking, and others, they live in the <HI>Douane.</HI></P>

There is also several Colleges where they teach Law. There is no River which passes by the City of <HI>Morocco,</HI> but a great many Water-Ditches, and Channels on Land to guide the Waters <NOTE PLACE="marg">Water.</NOTE> which come in abundance from the Mountains of <HI>Atlas,</HI> partly from the Springs, and partly from the melted

Without the City▪ about the Fields, are a great number of Gardens, with all sorts of Fruits▪ and Vineyards, with Water; and a little Habitation to go recreate them∣selves: They keep their Slaves at work: All the Ground is very good and fer∣tile, and the Seed presently ripens. The Mountains are on every side of the City, except on that towards <HI>Saffy,</HI> which is level. There are the Moun∣tains of <HI>Draz</HI> towards <HI>Lybia,</HI> from whence comes the good Dates.

<P>As for Justice; there is in <HI>Morocco</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Justice.</NOTE> but one only Judge, which they call <HI>Haquin,</HI> who does ready Justice most commonly upon the place; and hath continually his <HI>Citeres,</HI> or Sergeants, on Foot, armed with Cudgels, and <HI>Alfan∣ges,</HI> or Cimmeters; and as occasion requires, when it appears to be some

I will content my self to have said this little of several other things, which I could describe con∣cerning this City and Country of <HI>Morocco,</HI> since they are so well known to every one; only, I will add to this, that about 6 Leagues from <HI>Morocco,</HI> near to <HI>Atlas,</HI> is a City called <HI>Angou∣met,</HI>

where are still to be seen a great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Angoumet</NOTE> many ruinous Buildings of the <HI>Roman▪</HI> and Antique Letters * half worn out: The City is little, and nothing but Ruins.

There is some signs that these People should be the relicts of the antient <HI>Africans▪</HI> Inhabitants of the Country before the <HI>Arabian Saracens</HI> entered there; and that they retired there for security, being also in some manner Christians; but since, the society and imperiousness of the <HI>Arabians</HI> have corrupted them▪</P>
<P>As for the rest, when I arrived at <HI>Morocco</HI> the Affairs of the Country were thus; That <HI>Muley-Boufairs</HI> the then King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> one of the Sons

After that, he sent some of the <HI>Alcaydes</HI> his great Favourites to go fetch his Wives and his Daughter, who brought along with them all his Treasure, but they were Robb'd before day, near to <HI>Angoumet,</HI> in a place where they had sat down to take a little rest from the fatigue of the way. The <HI>Brebbes</HI> had his Wives and Daughters at their pleasure, and carried his Daughter to <HI>Muley-Abdalla,</HI> because he desired her to Wife, though she was his Cousin.
<PB N="163" REF="137"/>
The <HI>Alcaydes</HI> or Conductors of these Women, seeing themselves thus Rob'd, and without any means to recover their loss, did enter themselves into an <HI>Asoy</HI> or Mosque to the <HI>Alforme,</HI> or Sanctuary, of a Saint <HI>Marabou.</HI> But <HI>Muley-Abdalla</HI> hearing of it, sent to fetch them out, with the <HI>Marabou</HI> also, who earnestly desired <HI>Abdalla</HI> to give them their Lives, which he promised to do; But before they arrived at his <HI>Micouart,</HI> or Palace, he commanded all their Heads to be chopped off; <NOTE PLACE="marg">African <HI>Faith.</HI></NOTE> which he sent to his Father at <HI>Fez,</HI> who was not so well pleased thereat as he expected, because he had de∣ceived the <HI>Marabou.</HI> This was the State of the Affairs of these Princes.</P>
<P>Now, as I passed one day about the <HI>Alcasaue,</HI> which is the King's House, I saw a Cannon cast of a wonderful bigness; and being surprised at the greatness of the size, I was told that it had been made for a certain <HI>Alcayde,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Story of an</HI> Alcayde.</NOTE> a great Favourite, who had a mind to betray a King of <HI>Morocco:</HI> But the King having discovered the Treason, by the means of one of his Letters; Hereupon, one day, without making

shew of any thing, demanded (by way of question) of this <HI>Alcayde,</HI> if there was a Servant dearly Beloved of his Master, and nevertheless who sought to Kill, what such a Servant would deserve; The <HI>Alcayde</HI> present∣ly answered, that he deserved to be put alive into a Cannon, and to be shot out like a Ball; to which the King replied, That he himself deser∣ved <NOTE PLACE="marg">Justice of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raytor.</NOTE> the same Punishment; and there∣upon shewin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him the Letter writ by his own Hand, the other remained all astonished and benummed; and then the King ordered this Cannon to be made, in which he commanded to be put this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lcayde,</HI> to fire him out as he himself had fore-judged by his own Mouth, according as the Treason deserved.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Morocco,</HI> there are a great number of Christian Captives, as well Men as Women, who are brought there to be sold from all Parts of <HI>Barbary:</HI> Now it happened upon a time that a Christian Maid, <NOTE PLACE="marg">History of a Christian Maid and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Mar∣tyrdom.</NOTE> being Slave in a great House of the City, instructed a young Woman of the same House in the Christian Reli∣gion,
<PB N="165" REF="138"/>
teaching her secretly her Belief, in∣somuch that this Damsel engrafted so well the Law of the True God in her Heart, that it was impossible for her for∣mer Teachers to make her learn any more of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> or Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and kept her self constant in the Religi∣on of the Slave, without going any more to the Mosque. The King be∣ing informed thereof, sent for this New Convert to come before him, and Threatning her, that if she would not renounce the Law of the Christi∣ans, he would put her to Death, She generously answered, that she did not fear Death; and that all the Tor∣ments of the World should not make her quit the Belief she had acquir'd. The King seeing this, commanded her to be put into the Hands of the <HI>Haquin,</HI> or great Judge, to be put to Death: But she being resolved not to make any shew that she feared Death, and about to be executed, the King asked her again if she would not be Converted to their Law again: But, she answered, that their Law signified nothing in reference to Sal∣vation; and that she would Die for
<PB N="166" REF="139"/>
the Love of him who had suffered Death for us. When this barbarous King saw that all these Prayers and Remonstrances were in vain, he en∣deavoured once more to divert her from this Resolution, promising to Marry her to one of his highest Court Favourites; But she mocked the more at all his Promises; at which, the King being enraged, commanded her to be Beheaded, which was done accordingly. And thus Christianly, and constantly, this innocent and ver∣tuous Damsel suffered Martyrdom.</P>
<P>Now as I curiously visited this City of <HI>Morocco,</HI> I entered one day into <NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings-Palace.</NOTE> the <HI>Micouart,</HI> or Palace of the King, and saw in the first Court extraordi∣nary fine Buildings <HI>A-la-Moresque,</HI> with Fountains, and a great many Orange and Lemon-Trees, laden with Fruit; But at the second Court, where I also entered, were little Gal∣leries sustained with Pillars of White Marble, so well cut, and contrived, that the best Workmen would ad∣mire the Workman-ship thereof; and upon the Ground were a great num∣ber of Vessels of Marble, full of clear

and fresh Water, where I saw the Moors wash themselves before their going to Rehearse their <HI>Sala</HI> or Prayers▪ But as soon as they espied me, they began to cry out, and run after me, which made me mend my pace in good earnest to get presently from thence. I saw in another Garden, a very fine Fish Pond of Stone Work, where the Moors Bath themselves, and found there some Moorish Women who were washing their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lquisayes</HI> or Vails, after that they had washed their Bodies.</P>

as knowing his Strength, began to scratch him gently with his Teeth up∣on a Scab which the Lion had upon his Throat; at which, the Lion took such pleasure, that he not only suffered the Dog patiently so to do, but also defended him from the others: So that when I saw him, he had been then seven years with these Lions, as the Christian Slave told me who look'd after them; and told me also, that when they gave the Lions any thing to Eat, the Dog fed with them, and would sometimes snatch the Meat from their very Chops; And when the Lions would fight together for their Food, the Dog did all he could to part them and when he saw he could not do it, by a Natural Instinct he began to howl after such a manner, that the Lions (who fear the cry of Dogs)▪ presently would part them∣selves, and agree together.</P>
<P>This example of Animals shews that we ought to be humble and obedient towards those who are greater than our selves, and how noble and gene∣rous the Lion is amongst other Beasts.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="140"/>
At my going from these Lions, I went to see the Kings Horses, who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Horses.</NOTE> were in Stalls after their manner, and were fat, and extraordinary well Dress'd and clean Skin'd. They are Christian Slaves who look after them, and have a great, and lesser Stable also, well ordered that it is impossible for any to be better: They are all Barb-Horses, the finest in the World. After having walked enough about the City for this time, I returned back to the <HI>Douane,</HI> which is the place where the Christians are oblig'd to retire themselves, a good League from the <HI>Alcasave,</HI> or Palace Royal, which is near the <HI>Juderie.</HI></P>
<P>I was there told a very pleasant <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>History of a Son of the King of</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> History of a King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> who having upon a time sent one of his Sons with an Army to conquer the Kingdom of <HI>Gago,</HI> from whence comes the finest Gold. This young Prince having passed all the Desarts of <HI>Lybia</HI> with great Trouble and Fatigue, which both he and his Army there endured, as he approached the Coun∣try of <HI>Gago,</HI> this King, informed of his coming, went to meet him with a
<PB N="170" REF="141"/>
great Army of Blacks, and invested and encompassed him about, so that he could get neither backward nor forward; and besides, he was op∣pressed with two great Extremities, Hunger and Thirst; insomuch, that the most part of his Men were Sick, and knew not what to do in such an extremity: For, to continue there, they must all Die with Hunger, or yield themselves Victims to their Enemies Malice; and to return, or to pass on, they must give Battel; and his Men were so weak, as well by the fatigue of the way, by the Desart, as for want of Victuals. Now as this Prince of <HI>Morocco</HI> was in this perplexity in his Tent, it happened that two of his Soldiers were playing at Chess in their Tent, and one of them found himself so much engaged, that he could not make his King go either backward or forward, he being under Check; up∣on which his Companion, Laughing, said, he was like their Prince, who could neither advance nor retire with∣out exposing himself to great danger: As he was saying these Words, it hap∣pened that one of the Prince's Favou∣rites,
<PB N="171" REF="141"/>
passing by chance near this Tent, overheard them, and went presently away to give his Master an account of this Discourse, who, hearing it, sent at that instant to fetch these two Sol∣diers before him, who were mightily astonished; and having enquired se∣veral things of them, and particularly of that which they had done and said; At last, seeing themselves urged, they confessed the truth, and prostrat∣ing themselves upon the Ground, they begged his Pardon, which the Prince did easily consent to, and demanded of him, who had said thus, what he would advise him to do in such an extremity: The Soldier wisely an∣swered, that if he would take his Advice, he should not only save him∣self and his Men, but should also come of with great Honour, if the thing which he had contrived in his Mind took effect. The Prince Commanded him to say boldly what he would; upon which the Soldier proceeded, and said, that the King of <HI>Gago</HI> had a Beautiful Daughter to Marry, and that he, who was a young Prince, and wanted a Wife, should send Ambas∣sadors
<PB N="172" REF="142"/>
to this King to let him under∣stand that he was not come into his Country with intention to make War upon him, but only to demand his Daughter in Marriage, of whom he had heard many Perfections and ex∣cellent Qualities reported. The Prince found this Counsel so good, and so much to the purpose, that he present∣ly dispatches Ambassadors to this King, upon this account, who were very well received, according to their Ambassage, and the Peace made accordingly; The Marriage was agreed upon by this means, and Consummated with great Triumphing <HI>A-la-Moresque.</HI> The Prince receiv'd from his Father-in▪Law, the King of <HI>Gago,</HI> several curious and rich Presents, amongst others three Balls of Gold, hollow within, weighing in all 750 pounds, and are all three of a wonderful bigness, but proportiona∣bly one a little less than the other, and are to be seen to this day in the <HI>Alca∣save,</HI> or Palace at <HI>Morocco,</HI> upon the top of a high Tower, being all three fastened upon a Bar, the greatest at the bottom▪ and so mounting, the least at top: When the Sun shines they
<PB N="173" REF="142"/>
cast a Reflex at a great distance, as I observed in my coming to <HI>Morocco:</HI> In the Wars they have fired several shots of Musquet at them, but with∣out any prejudice. Thus the Coun∣sel of this Soldier took happy effect, and since that time, the Kingdom of <HI>Gago,</HI> (of which this Daughter was Heiress) fell to the Kings of <HI>Morocco,</HI> who send there to fetch their Gold. After having returned from my Voy∣age, one day as I was at Dinner with the late King <HI>Henry the Great,</HI> who had taken Physick that day, and was in his morning Gown in his Closet, I was desiring his Majesty to grant me liberty to go to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> he thereupon came to speak of the play at Chess, and how that two of the Grandees of his Court had been two days and two nights at playing a Game at Chess; upon which, the King dis∣covering the cunning and subtility of this play, I took the boldness to relate to him this History of the Prince of <HI>Morocco,</HI> at which he was mightily pleased, and thought the Soldier's in∣vention very much to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pplauded: In short, all these Moors are great
<PB N="174" REF="143"/>
players at Chess, as I have observed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Game of Chess a∣mongst the Moors.</NOTE> amongst them. For at such time as I went to the <HI>Juderie,</HI> I found almost all those who kept the Door a playing at this Game, at which they are very subtile; and it is mighty diverting to them, in regard of their Melancholly Humour; which renders them very ingenious, and great lovers of sharp and subtile Tricks; as there was one day one of them, who made shew of Friendship to another, and gave him great store of Fruit upon a Carpet to Eat: But the other, who was thus Honoured, told him gently, give me not so much Meat, but thy Heart ra∣ther; which was to say Good-Will and Affection, for he well knew that he wished him no good in his Mind. This Story is said to be of the <HI>Alcayde Mummin.</HI></P>
<P>After having continued for some time at <HI>Morocco,</HI> seeing that the Ca∣ravan <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au∣thors re∣turn.</NOTE> was preparing to go away for <HI>Saffy,</HI> I endeavoured to obtain my Letter of Free passage of the <HI>Haquin,</HI> who is the great Justice there, to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Haquin.</NOTE> end that I might safely Embark, with∣out any Let or Hindrance by those of
<PB N="175" REF="143"/>
<HI>Saffy.</HI> I payed then for my Entrance ond going out to the <HI>Talbes</HI> of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Talbes.</NOTE> <HI>Douane,</HI> who keep the Door, which is a right that every Christian who comes to <HI>Morocco</HI> is obliged to pay; And truly 'tis impossible ever to have done enough to satisfie these sort of People.</P>
<P>I parted then from <HI>Morocco</HI> the 22th of <HI>October,</HI> and went to pitch the <HI>Al∣mahalle</HI> some 4▪ or 5 Leagues distant, in a Campagne, along by Mount <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tlas;</HI> and being there, there were 3 or 4 Companies of us who went into the <HI>Adouars,</HI> or Tents of the Arabians, to furnish our selves with Fowls, Eggs, and other Victuals. But when we came there we perceived a great num∣ber of Cavalliers of the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, running after one another, who drove away their Camels and other Beasts. The Wives of these Arabians took the Saddles of their Husbands Horses up∣on their Heads, and run to the place where their Horses were feeding: The Husbands, who were hard by at work, presently mounted on Horseback, and flew like lightning after their Enemies, with their Launces and other Instru∣ments;
<PB N="176" REF="144"/>
and I believe that at last they recovered their own. These Women advised us to return with all speed to our Camp, for fear that these Arabs, their Enemies, should carry us away Captives; which we did, seeing all in an uproar and confusion, and the noise which they made amongst them∣selves: For it is a strange thing to see these People, who are all of the same <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>War a∣mongst the</HI> Arabians.</NOTE> Law and Nation, to make so frequent War upon one another.</P>
<P>But, amongst themselues, they ob∣serve this Rule and Discipline, that when the time comes for them to Sow their Land or to Reap their Corn, they make Peace; After that, they begin again to their Wars when their Corn is beaten, and laid up in their <HI>Matamores</HI> or Ditches in the Field, where they put it, then cover it with Planks, and above that with Earth, after such a manner that they can Till and Sow upon it▪ They lay up their Grain thus in the night, that none may see them▪ no not their very Wives nor their Children: Afterwards▪ if they happen to have occasion for any quantity of Corn, either to Sow, or
<PB N="177" REF="144"/>
to carry to sell at <HI>Morocco,</HI> they go and take it forth of this Magazine. This Corn is kept very well in the Ground, where it keeps dry a long time.</P>
<P>The 23th of the same month we went to pitch the <HI>Almahalle</HI> close by Mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> in a level ground, in which place I went to look for some Plants and Herbs, and as I returned again into the Camp, the <HI>Alcayde Ab∣dassis,</HI> Captain of a Cabille of <HI>Arabians,</HI> perceived me, and called me to him, asking me what Herbs these were that I carried, and what I intended to do with them; after I had satisfied his Demands, I withdrew into our Tent: About 4 or 5 a clock in the evening, going out to walk and to take the fresh Air, I met again with the <HI>Alcayde,</HI> who was also walking about to visit his Camp; and having called me, took me by the Hand, and led me without the Camp, giving me account of se∣veral things of the Wars of <HI>Africa,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>History of the Battle</HI> of <HI>Don</HI> Se∣bastian <HI>of</HI> Portugal.</NOTE> concerning the Battle of Don <HI>Sebastian,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> at which time he was a young Man, it being 35 years since: He told me amongst other things, how the Christians at that time
<PB N="178" REF="145"/>
were reserved to extirpate them: But that they who were before at Wars amongst themselves, (tho of one Faith) had made Peace together, to the end that they might the better defend them∣selves against the Christians, and went to meet the Christians towards the City of <HI>Tangier,</HI> which belonged to the Portugals, That there they re∣solved to venter Battle with Don <HI>Se∣bastian,</HI> who was accompanied with a Moorish King, who was a near Kins∣man to the Kings of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and who was said to be the lawful King, and that the others had Usurped upon his Prerogative. As these two Armies were in Battalia near by one another, the Christians made no shew of attack∣ing the first, but kept themselves as on the Defensive; they on the contrary were all in the Action, continually ex∣ercising themselves at the Launce, one against another; and seeing that the Christians did not stir, they came fu∣riously to attack them; but having been beat back at the beginning, they betook themselves to flight, and the Christians pursued them, in such disor∣der and confusion, that thinking them∣selves
<PB N="179" REF="145"/>
too sure of Victory, the Moors thereupon Rallying upon these disor∣derly pursuers, easily broke them: And thus Don <HI>Sebastian</HI> lost the Battle▪ where he was killed upon the place, with two other Kings; and they had a great number of Prisoners, who were carried to <HI>Morocco.</HI></P>
<P>He told me also of <HI>Muley-Hamet Maluco,</HI> or <HI>Abdelmelech,</HI> one of the Kings <NOTE PLACE="marg">Muley Maluco, <HI>or</HI> Abdeme∣lech.</NOTE> which had won the Battle, who died of Sickness in his Litter, after having given good Orders to all. When they who were about him perceived he was Dead, they concealed his Death for fear of discouraging the Soldiers, who had the better; and used this Artifice, that is, they put forth his Hand as if he had been still alive: He himself had found out this trick, and had ordered them to make use of it after his Death.</P>
<P><HI>Abdassis</HI> having related to me thus <NOTE PLACE="marg">Muley Boufairs <HI>King of</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> much, told me also of <HI>Muley-Boufairs,</HI> the then King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and how that he gave himself wholly over to his Wives and Concubines, and trusted too much upon a Bassa, named <HI>Joda,</HI> and was likely to loose the Battle, which he design'd to engage in when
<PB N="180" REF="146"/>
we parted from <HI>Morocco;</HI> and that all his delight was in <HI>Comer, Couscoussou, Auquam;</HI> that is, eating of a certain Confection made up into Sugar-Plums; but he found himself deceived; for he lost the Battle, as I have said already, and was Deposed from his Kingdom, and fled away to Mount <HI>Atlas</HI> about the month of <HI>November</HI> 1606. accord∣ing as our <HI>Noster-Damus</HI> had predicted in his Centuries, as I have been shewed since: <HI>Abdassis</HI> told me also thereupon, that the Soldiers are mightily discou∣raged when the King comes not to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Good ad∣vice for Kings.</NOTE> Battle in Person; And when he is Couragious, or a Coward, his Sol∣diers become the same.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Couscoussou</HI> of which I have made mention, and which I have Ta∣sted <NOTE PLACE="marg">Coucous∣sou.</NOTE> several times, it is Meal made up and Kneaded into the fashion of Sugar-Plums or Comfits, with Water, in a Frying-pan; then put it in an Earthen Vessel full of holes at the bottom, like a Cullender, after that, it is put in a Pot upon a hot Fire, and the Vapour boils it; then they pour Broth there∣upon, and eat it by great bits like Balls: It is of a very good Taste, which nou∣rishes
<PB N="181" REF="146"/>
and fattens the Body to Admi¦ration. <HI>I</HI> have often Eat thereof, it being prepared for me by the Moorish and Jewish Women: Their Corn is very fit for it, because it is very dry; ours, which is more moist, would not be so good, except it were first well dried.</P>
<P>After this Discourse of the <HI>Alcayde,</HI> we withdrew our selves into our Tents until the next morning that we began again to take Journey, and had that day very bad way by steep and inac∣cessible Mountains, not being able to keep any Order for the insupportable Heat; as for fresh Water we had none. I was mounted upon a Mule, and was forced frequently to get down to beat it away on foot, which was no small trouble for me, in that I had near 6000 Crowns about me, as well in Lignots, as in Tybre, that is Powder, as it comes from <HI>Gago,</HI> and also in Money, which are Sequins of the Country: I had a great deal of trouble to remount; for it did not behove me to stay behind, for fear of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and of those of our Caravan themselves.</P>
<P>Having passed all the hardships of this Journey, we came to pitch at the
<PB N="182" REF="147"/>
<HI>Duquele,</HI> where these <HI>Matamores</HI> are, of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Duquele.</NOTE> which I have so much spoken. Here came several <HI>Arabians</HI> on Horseback, mounted in order with their Launces, to salute <HI>Abdassis</HI> their Chief, and Cap∣tain of their <HI>Cabille,</HI> every one bring∣ing him Presents▪ then after having kissed his Hands, they returned again to their <HI>Adouars,</HI> who were gone above 2 or 3 Leagues from thence. The next day, the 2d of <HI>October,</HI> we went to lie at <HI>Saffy,</HI> and as we approached there, passing through some Woods of Broom, very high, there was two Moorish Cavalliers, who took me out of the right way, making me go with them cross these Brooms, which were so high that one could scarce see another in the middle of them. I was upon my Mule, and coming near to an old Well, they got down, bidding me also to do the like: I thought there had been there some Fountain to refresh our selves; but seeing that they had a mind to make me get down only to entice me into this Well, I immediate∣ly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger of the Author</NOTE> turned my Mule about towards the great Highway, with all the speed I possibly could, and thus narrowly es∣caped
<PB N="183" REF="147"/>
from their Hands: Their de∣sign was, (as I believe) to make me quit the Gold and Silver which I car∣ried, and then to cut my Throat, and to cast me in some Ditch: But I had a good Inspiration when I was just up∣on the point of descending; and as my good Angel would have it, the great Road, through which the Cara∣van passed was not far from thence, which did facilitate my safety▪ My too much Diligence, and the great desire that I had to advance to get to <HI>Saffy</HI> the first, had been the cause of this Accident. At last, by the Grace of God, I arrived happily at <HI>Saffy:</HI> After ha∣ving a little refreshed my self, I took care for my Embarkment, and caused my Materials to be visited by the <HI>Tal∣bes,</HI> and payed them their due.</P>
<P>The next day, when I thought to Embark, causing my things to be car∣ried to the Port, the <HI>Talbes</HI> came and demanded of me the Letter and Pass∣port from the <HI>Haquin</HI> of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and having given it them, they told me it signified nothing to the purpose, be∣cause <HI>Muley-Boufairs</HI> was no longer King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and that it behoved
<PB N="184" REF="148"/>
me to have another from <HI>Muley-Ab∣dalla,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Muley Abdalla <HI>King of</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> who was then King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> under his Father <HI>Muley-Chec,</HI> who was at <HI>Fez:</HI> I was very much afflicted at this Retardment, which made me loose the convenience of a Ship, that was bound for <HI>France.</HI> Nevertheless, be∣ing forced to have patience, it behoved me to send a <HI>Trotier</HI> or Messenger to <HI>Morocco</HI> with our Letter to have ano∣ther, which could not be done with∣out a great deal of Trouble and Ex∣pences: But my ill fortune was, that this Letter being come, I must be for∣ced to wait there near 2 months, upon the account of a Dutch Ship, which was not to set sail till <HI>January</HI> 1607.</P>
<P>This change of Affairs at <HI>Morocco</HI> happened after my departure from the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Revoluti∣ons at</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> City: For <HI>Muley-Boufairs</HI> King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> having lost the Battle against his Nephew <HI>Abdalla,</HI> fled away into the Mountains, where he was Robb'd, as I have said, and <HI>Abdalla</HI> was then in peaceable possession of <HI>Morocco;</HI> But during the Peace, <HI>Abdalla</HI> having discovered that the other hatched some Treason to dispossess him, he Stabb'd him with his own Hands, after having
<PB N="185" REF="148"/>
reproached him with his Perfidie: But after that, <HI>Zidan</HI> his Uncle, with the help of a <HI>Santon,</HI> or <HI>Marabou,</HI> hath chased away <HI>Abdalla,</HI> and made himself King of <HI>Morocco:</HI> Afterwards he him∣self was chased away by the <HI>Santon;</HI> and it was said that they were ready to engage in Battle together, and since I have heard that the <HI>Santon</HI> had been taken by <HI>Ziden,</HI> who had put him to Death by Sawing him down through the middle, with two pieces of Wood: Since that, he and his Nephew <HI>Abdalla</HI> had agreed together, and by the A∣greement, the Kingdoms of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Sus</HI> fell to <HI>Abdalla,</HI> and that of <HI>Mo∣rocco</HI> to <HI>Zidan.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Marabous</HI> or <HI>Santons,</HI> they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Santons <HI>dangerous.</HI></NOTE> are very dangerous amongst these Peo∣ple, by reason that the pretext of De∣votion and Sanctity of their Law, as in all others, is a great means to Com∣motions against the State, as it is often seen, and of fresh memory in him, who within this 100 years hath founded this last Family, which does Rule there at this day.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Muley-Chec,</HI> who was at <HI>Mo∣rocco,</HI> he went into <HI>Spain,</HI> out of a de∣sire
<PB N="186" REF="149"/>
to become Christian, and indeed he delivered the strong place of <HI>Ara∣che</HI> into the hands of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who for this gave him a Pension, and promised to restore him, with an Army, to the Kingdoms of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco:</HI> But those of <HI>Fez</HI> would not hearken to that, not agreeing with the Spani∣ards; And <HI>Abdalla</HI> his Son returned to <HI>Fez,</HI> who also hindered him, insomuch, that the <HI>Chec</HI> has been since constrain'd to go back again of his own accord, without gaining any thing of the Spa∣niards save the loss of putting such a place into their Hands.</P>
<P>But to return to the Abode that I was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sassy <HI>and its Des∣cription.</HI></NOTE> forced to make at <HI>Sassy,</HI> I employed my self in the mean time in viewing this City, and the Parts there abouts<HI>:</HI> 'Tis a little City situated upon the brink of the Sea, which has no convenient Ha∣ven but only a Road, and flat Shore, and has formerly been possessed by the Portugals: It may be as big as <HI>Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eil,</HI> and very well Walled, being in habited by all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of People, as Jews, Moors, and Christians, and hath a <HI>Douane.</HI></P>
<P>Doing there, I observed amongst other thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the manner of their Marriages,
<PB N="187" REF="149"/>
which are performed with this Ceremo∣ny. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of the Mar∣riages.</NOTE> They put the Bride upon a Mule, well furnished, and surrounded with a Hoop like a Cage, covered with a Car∣pet, after the Turkish manner: Scarce∣ly can any see this Woman thus shut up, but she can see the whole company through a transparent Vail: At the top of this is a Scarf: They walk her in this Equipage round about the City, and cause to follow after several Mules laden with Baggage of that which the Bride has given her in Marriage: Then follow the Men and Women, mounted also upon Mules. Both the Men and Women make a strange and ridiculous noise as they pass along, with their Mouths and Tongues. Amongst these are double Drums, <HI>A-la-Moresque.</HI> Af∣ter having finished▪ this walk, they go to Dinner, then they return to the place. And if it is the Wife of a Cavallier, or Man of War, all his Friends assemble there on Horseback, who exercise them∣selves at justing, continuing 2 or 3 hours before the Bride; then after that every one withdraws<HI>:</HI> As for the rest, if the Husband does not find his Wife a Maid, he Divorces her, and sends her back
<PB N="188" REF="150"/>
with all that she brought; and for this they cause the Drawers of the Bride to be carried about the City, all stained in Blood, to testifie that she was a Virgin. The Jews cry, and observe the same thing.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the Dead, they have Burying-Places and Sepulchers, where they go to Weep and Lament <NOTE PLACE="marg">Burials.</NOTE> upon the Graves of their departed Friends, especially the Women, who fail not to go there every <HI>Friday,</HI> and the days of their Festivals. The Jews do the same, as I have observed in <HI>Syria,</HI> where they use a certain Vessel pierced with holes at the bottom, and make their Tears run down from thence, right upon the Sepulcher, which is en∣vironed with all kind of Flowers.</P>
<P>I will add to this, that all the Moors are nothing else but Captives &amp; Slaves <NOTE PLACE="marg">Moors Slaves to their King.</NOTE> of their King; for they dare not so much as stir out of the Country and Kingdom, without his express Licence and Command, as I have taken notice of several times at <HI>Saffy.</HI> I remember one day, a young Man, a Moor, having by chance cast himself into a Boat of the Christians, out of curiosity, or to
<PB N="189" REF="150"/>
play and Fish, the <HI>Haquin</HI> seeing him, caused him to be taken by his Ser∣jeants, then to be laid upon the Ground and cruelly Bastinadoed.</P>
<P>Whilst I was at <HI>Saffy,</HI> waiting for my departure, I went about the Fields and Desarts to look for Plants and de∣licate Flowers to carry to the King. I gathered a great many of them, which I laid up, and having caused Biscuit to be made for my Voyage, with other Refreshments, we set sail the 24th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1607. and having contrary Winds <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Departure for</HI> France.</NOTE> towards the South Line: Having been driven from one side to the other, we arrived in the end near the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> in very tempestuous weather, having been so beaten by contrary Winds, we knew not well how far we had to any Land, in regard that we were scarce able to take the heighth of the Sun or Stars; But thereupon seeing a Ship coming, much about the bigness of ours, streight to us, we lowred our Sails to tarry for her, making signs for her to come up, which they did▪ telling us, that the South Line was very near <NOTE PLACE="marg">South-line,</NOTE> us, and what Wind was best for us to take: We were very glad at this news,
<PB N="190" REF="151"/>
and a little after we saw the South-Line; but the Weather was very tem∣pestuous, and I believe that without this advice we should have gone near to have lost our selves on▪ the Rocks, which are low and in great numbers.</P>
<P>Being entered into the Channel, we descried a Ship, making full sail upon us, and believing that it was a Flem∣ing, we prepared our selves to receive her, but the night coming on, which was very Stormy, we lost her, bear∣ing more to the N.E. The next morn∣ing we saw the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> imagining <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wight-Island.</NOTE> it was the Land of <HI>England:</HI> But ap∣proaching nearer, we sound out our mistake, and Coasting it a little, we perceiv'd the Land of <HI>England,</HI> which lay to the N. E. of us, and went to cast Anchor in a Bay, which advanced into the Land, and where there was a little Village: Those of the place see∣ing us Anchor there, came on board us, and told us, that when the Sea went out we should be a-ground, and that it behoved us to set sail in all haste to go to a Port not far from thence; so they helped and conducted us to the said Port, near the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ports-mout.</NOTE> Poulle,
<PB N="191" REF="151"/>
in a Creek, not far from a Tower, where we were at Harbour: But the night being come, we had the strangest and most horrible Storm that had been heard of of a long time; insomuch that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpest.</NOTE> we were forced to cast 3 or 4 Anchors▪ which were all little enough to hold our Ship.</P>
<P>This happened on <HI>Shrove-Tuesday▪</HI> the 27th of <HI>Feb.</HI> and in this Storm two Ships were lost near the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> the one a Fleming, who was lading, and the other a French, who seeing themselves near being lost, put out the Boat to save themselves, leaving no∣thing in the Ship save a Cat: But these People approaching near Land, a Wave came which o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erturned the Boat, and they were all lost.</P>
<P>The Ship in the mean time went with a right Winds towards <HI>Plimouth▪</HI> a Town and Port of <HI>England:</HI> Some People from the Coast seeing this Ship thus sail towards Land, where there was no Port, ran to give them notice thereof; But calling out aloud, and no <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Accident.</NOTE> one answering, they knew not what to think, judging they might be Pirates, who had not a mind to be known▪
<PB N="192" REF="152"/>
In the end, seeing the Ship like to be cast away, they resolved to Board her, and entering, they found nothing but this Cat, at which they were mightily astonished, and took the Ship into Port; It was laden with Corn, and after ha∣ving heard that the People were lost near the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> they left it in the hands of the Justice, until it might be restored to the right Owners.</P>
<P>This great Storm, the cause of all these Accidents, was such, that it cau∣sed a great distraction and loss of Peo∣ple, along the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> as we heard since. When we came to <HI>Ports∣mouth</HI> we found out the Truth of this, and how the Sea had overwhelmed certain places a good way within <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> which is a pleasant Sea Port <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ports∣mouth.</NOTE> Town.</P>
<P>After having been some days at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> to refresh our selves, and to wait for a Wind to carry us to <HI>Havre-de-Grace,</HI> where our Ship was to go, to leave there some Merchandize of <HI>Barbary:</HI> When the Wind was fa∣vourable to us, we set sail the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> and the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day in the evening we arrived at the Haven, for which I
<PB N="193" REF="152"/>
praised God, for having delivered me from so many Perils and Dangers; and going by Land to <HI>Roan,</HI> I there tarried for my Materials, which were brought in the Hoy; and having re∣ceived and laded them in a Boat upon the River, I went straight to <HI>Paris,</HI> where I arrived the 25th of <HI>March▪</HI> From thence I went to <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> to give the King an account of my Voy∣age, and to present him with the Plants and Rarities which Ihad brought, with which his Majesty was mighty well pleased, enquiring of me several things, to which I answered him in the best manner I could: And desiring to know further of me, what it was that <HI>Muley-Zidan</HI> did, I answered him, that he had encamped in the Desarts with his Army▪ and amongst other things, I gave him account of 3 Caval∣liers belonging to <HI>Muley-Boufairs,</HI> his Brother, with whom he had War, the which being come into his <HI>Almahalle,</HI> to render themselves to him, he deman∣ded of them if they came to him of their own Free-Will, and having answered him they did, and that they had quitted <HI>Muley-Boufairs,</HI> because
<PB N="194" REF="153"/>
they had been falsly accused of a Rob∣bery in the <HI>Juderie</HI> at <HI>Morocco: Zidan</HI> hearing this, asked them if they took him for a Receiver of Robbers, and thereupon commanded them to be Be∣headed, shewing thereby a great Act of Justice for a Barbarian and Maho∣metan: Having finished this Discourse and several others to the late King, and presented him with the Plants and Rarities, and the White Honey of <HI>Africa,</HI> exceeding clear and excellent, of which his Majesty tasted, and caused me to lay it carefully up, I went back to <HI>Paris</HI> to think in good earnest of the Voyage that I had a mind to make to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>

<HEAD>BOOK IV.</HEAD>
<P>LIke as our desires are never satisfied in this life, but continually cove∣ting after new Things, until we are entered into a perfect enjoyment of those which we desire most; so, being returned from my last Voyage of <HI>A∣frica,</HI> the desire of my former design
<PB N="198" REF="155"/>
was renewed in me to go to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> from which I had been diver∣ted by the occasion that I have given account of in the beginning of my third Book; so that having taken a Resolu∣tion at this time, I took my leave of the King and Queen in the year 1607. and parted from <HI>Paris</HI> the 16th of <HI>O∣ctober,</HI> with a design to pass into <HI>Bri∣tagne,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>I Embarked thence the 16th of <HI>Nov.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Embarking for</HI> Portu∣gal.</NOTE> in a Ship of <HI>Poligain,</HI> belonging to one named <HI>Yves Bigram,</HI> and we were a∣bout 18 or 20 men in all. This was in a morning, and in a very great Storm: We went on Board with no small trouble, the Waves covering us very frequently. As soon as we were there▪ we set sail; the Wind being for us: This Ship was bound for <HI>Sevill,</HI> but, as fortune would have it, being towards the Cape of <HI>Pichay,</HI> we met with so furious a Tempest, the Wind being quite contrary to us to gain the Cape of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Vincent,</HI> that we were forced to slacken in the River of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where I was desirous to go: For it was the time the Fleet was preparing to go away. And arriving at <HI>Sevill,</HI> I had
<PB N="199" REF="155"/>
the trouble to return back to <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and perhaps, for all that, I might have lost the occasion of my Voyage.</P>
<P>We cast Anchor then at <HI>Sta. Cata∣rina,</HI> a little above <HI>Belin,</HI> the 2d of <HI>De∣cember:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Belin.</NOTE> I went on Shore, and lay at a place call'd <HI>Belin,</HI> where the Visitor of Health, hearing I was come with∣out Licence, commanded me to Re-Embark, under the forfeiture of 50 Ducats▪ He made all this stir only for want of a little Present: After having ordered my Business, I failed not to go to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where being come, I took a Lodging, and waited to Embark, and found there the Sieur <HI>de-Herve,</HI> who had been in the Service of the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and was very kind to these two Portugal Gentlemen, who were come out of Captivity; one being Son to the Vice-Roy of the <HI>East-Indies, Henry de Saldaigne;</HI> and the other, Brother to Don <HI>Baptiste Fernand Sezar,</HI> Provisor-General of the House of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and his Brother-in-Law, the Count <HI>de Fera</HI> went to the <HI>Indies</HI> for Vice roy. I desired my Friend, the Sieur <HI>de-Herve</HI> to speak to these Gen∣tlemen, his Friends, who had so much
<PB N="200" REF="156"/>
Credit, that by their means I might pass to the <HI>Indies. Pedro Sezar,</HI> Bro∣ther to <HI>Baptiste Fernand,</HI> promised him to do all he could, so that he spoke to the Count <HI>de Fera;</HI> and the said <HI>Herve,</HI> to oblige them the more, said, that I was his Brother; For those Gentlemen were very respectful to him for ha∣ving assisted them in the time of their Captivity with Money: They then desired me to speak to the Count <HI>de la Fera</HI> by the means of <HI>Baptiste Fernand,</HI> and told him that I was a very curious <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Count</HI> de la Fera.</NOTE> Man; and he hearing that I had knowledge of Plants, was mighty glad, and told me that there was great quan∣tity of good and rare Plants in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> which he had proved at such time that he was Captain at Arms: After <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proveditor</HI> de la Case d'Inde.</NOTE> that, he asked me my Name, and ha∣ving writ it in a Paper, he sent it by one of his Servants to the Proveditor of the House of <HI>India,</HI> who having read it, sent it to him again, saying, That a Stranger might not pass to the <HI>Indies</HI> without Licence from the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Count <HI>de la Fera,</HI> seeing this, caused a Letter to be writ at that in∣stant, in my presence, by <HI>Baptiste Fer∣nand,</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="156"/>
his Brother-in-Law, and sent it by the same Servant to Don <HI>Christo∣val,</HI> Vice-roy of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who com∣manded the Frenchman to be set down, that is to say, received. I was very glad of this Answer; and I with a Servant went to the House of <HI>India</HI> to carry this Licence to the Proveditor, Nephew to the Vice-roy, who kept it, and told him that brought it, that he could not set me down for this Per∣mission; but that he would speak of it to the Count <HI>de la Fera.</HI> I was ve∣ry sorry at this, and almost out of all hopes of going the Voyage: Hereup∣on I retired to my Lodging to consi∣der of what I had to do, that I might not loose this opportunity. The next day, going to find out the Servant of the Count <HI>de la Fera,</HI> I desired him to go with me, as from the Vice-roy his Master, which he willingly did, but I could not obtain any thing at that time; but I lost not Courage for all that; and the day following I went again to the Servant, and desired him to go with me but once more; and so we went together to the House of <HI>India</HI> before this Proveditor, the Servant
<PB N="202" REF="157"/>
bringing him Word from the Count <HI>de la Fera</HI> his Master; The Proveditor seeing himself so much importuned from him whom he durst not displease, in regard he was one of the Grandees of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and Vice-roy of the <HI>Indies▪</HI> He demanded of me my Name, and that of my Father, and of my Mother, and the place of my Birth; then he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author received for the Voyage.</NOTE> ordered me to be set down in the Book for a Natural French man. Thus at last I was received, of which I was exceeding glad, and gave the Servant many Thanks, promising to assist him all I could, as I did afterwards, he being sick: Two or 3 days after I went to receive my Pay, which was 7500 Rais, (there must be a thousand of them to make 25 Rials) and prepa∣red my self to Embark in the Admiral, in which the Vice-roy was to sail.</P>
<P>When the time of Embarkment came, there was a great Confusion amongst us, were being about 900. The Register called every one by their Name▪ to know if all were Em∣barked. My Host answered for me; and that he might not have any trou∣ble upon my account, I was present
<PB N="203" REF="157"/>
at the Lecture of all the Equipage<HI>:</HI> For it is a Register on shore which makes all this Inquest. These Cere∣monies being over, we set sail; first, five great Ships or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arracks, which were, the Admiral called <HI>Our Lady of Mount-Carmel</HI> the <HI>Olive,</HI> the <HI>Salva∣tion, Our Lady of the Indies,</HI> and the <HI>Palm;</HI> then 5 Gallies, <HI>St. Jerom,</HI> the <HI>Good Jesus,</HI> the <HI>Holy Ghost, St. Bartho∣lomew,</HI> and <HI>St. Anthony;</HI> then after these a Carrack, and two Hulks.</P>
<P>We parted from the River of <HI>Lis∣bon</HI> the 29th of <HI>March,</HI> on <HI>Easter-Eve,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parting from</HI> Lis∣bon.</NOTE> and bore to the <HI>S.</HI> W. and to the <HI>S.</HI> We had great Winds in the sight of <HI>Madera,</HI> and passing close thereby, the Galley of <HI>Good Jesus</HI> lost us, and took her Course as far as <HI>Mosambique,</HI> where she was taken by the Hollanders.</P>
<P>Amongst us was the greatest Dis∣order and Confusion imaginable, be∣cause of the Peoples Vomiting up and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Misery upon the Sea.</NOTE> down, and making Dung upon one another: There was nothing to be heard but Lamentations and Groans of those who were straightned with Thirst, Hunger, and Sicknesses, and other Incommodities, and Cursing the
<PB N="204" REF="158"/>
time of their Embarkment, their Fa∣thers and Mothers, and themselves, who were the cause thereof; so that one would have thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey had been out of their Wits, and like Mad∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, amongst the excessive heats un∣der the Line, and the Abrolles and Calms: This continued a long time, and the hot Rains upon the Coast of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> was also very troublesome to us, which afterwards turned to Worms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f that which was wet was not pre∣sently dried: It was a wonderful trou∣ble to me, to see my Quilt wet, and Worms crawling all over. These Rains are so stinking, that they rot and spoil, not only the Pody, but also all Cloths, Chests, Utensils, and other Things: And not having any more Cloths to shift my self withall, I was forced to dry upon me that which I wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, with my Quilt, by lying there∣upon; but I was well fitted for that; for the Fever, with a great pain in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> the Reins, took the in such a manner, that I had a fit of Sickness, almost, the whole Voyage; yet this was not all, for I had besides that, the <HI>Lovende,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> which the Portugals call <HI>Berber,</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="158"/>
and the Hollanders <HI>Scurbus,</HI> which rotted almost all my Gumbs, and ren∣dered a sort of a black and pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rified Blood; My Knees were so contracted that I could not bend my Limbs; my Legs and Thighs were as black as Members Gan-green'd, and was con∣strained to be continually Launcing to get out this black and putrified Blood. I Launced also my Gums, which were black and blue, and surmounting my <NOTE PLACE="marg">Miso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of the Autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> Teeth, going every day out upon the side of the Ship, holding by the Cor∣dage, with a little Looking▪Glass in my hand to see where to cut: When I had cut away this dead Flesh, and drawn away abundance of black Blood, I washed my Mouth and Teeth with Urine, but the next morning there was as much; And my ill fortune was, that I could not Eat, having more mind to swallow than to chew, upon the ac∣count of the great pains which this Disease causes. I found no better re∣medy than the Syrop of Gilli-flowers, and good red Wine: Great numbers Died every day thereof, and there was nothing to be seen but Bodies a fling∣ing over-board, and the most part Died
<PB N="206" REF="159"/>
without help, some behind Chests, having their Eyes, and the Soles of their Feet eaten up with Rats. Others were found Dead in their Beds, after having been let Blood, and moving their Arms, the Veins opened, and their Blood ran out: Oftentimes after having received their Allowance, which might be about a Pint of Wa∣ter, and putting it near them to Drink, when a-dry, their Companions rob'd these poor Sick Wretches of this little Water, they being asleep, or turned to the other side. Sometimes being under Deck in a dark place, not seeing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hirst.</NOTE> one another, they would fight amongst themselves, and strike one another, if they caught any about to Steal their Water; and thus, oftentimes were they deprived of Water, and for want of a little Draught they miserably di∣ed, without any one offering to help them to never so little, no not the Fa∣ther the Son, nor the Brother the Bro∣ther, so much did every Man's parti∣cular Thirst compel him to Rob his Companions. I found my self often∣times thus deceived of my allowance, but yet I comforted my self as well
<PB N="207" REF="159"/>
as I could, seeing so many others in the same case: And this was the cause that I durst not Sleep too much, and commonly put my Water where it could not be easily taken without wakening of me▪</P>
<P>After we had suffer'd thus much, and passed the Line, the Count <HI>de la Fera,</HI> Vice-roy, was took sick of a hot <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Count</HI> de la Fera <HI>falls Sick and Dies.</HI></NOTE> Fever, and continued so but 6 days before he died: He had a little before Commanded the <HI>Estrinquere,</HI> (which is he whose Office is to hoise the great Sail by a Wheel) to be made Prisoner▪ because he had <HI>Amancebado,</HI> that is to say, he kept a Concubine, which he had brought from <HI>Portugal,</HI> and she being with Child when she Embark'd, was brought to Bed in our Ship: The Woman was sent back to <HI>Portugal</HI> in the Hulk, in which was the Body of the Count <HI>de la Fera.</HI></P>
<P>This Gentleman being dead, I Em∣balmed his Body, because of the hot∣ness of the Climate; then having Em∣bark'd it with about 50 sick Persons, who were to return again to <HI>Portugal,</HI> tho not without great Intreaties to have the Licence of Captain <HI>More,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="160"/>
<HI>Major.</HI> We called this Captain of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Captain</HI> Major-Mor.</NOTE> the Vice-Admiral named <HI>Don Christo∣val de Norogne,</HI> to Command in the Admiral, where the said Captain <HI>Mor</HI> being, did us a thousand sorts of Inju∣ries and Cruelties, as well by Prisons, as by cheating us of our ordinary al∣lowance of Victuals; for he reserved several Pipes of Wine, and a great deal of Flesh and Oil to sell at <HI>Mozambique.</HI> Don <HI>Alfonce de Norogne,</HI> Captain of our Ship, under the Vice-roy, when he was alive, was mightily displeased at this bad usage of Don <HI>Cristoval;</HI> but he died within few days, and his Body was cast into the Sea.</P>
<P>Having passed about 9 or 10 De∣grees on the other side the Line, the Wind not being favourable to us, the Pilots held Council what they should do, whether to Tack about and return to <HI>Portugal,</HI> or to pass on, fearing they could not pass the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> in regard it was too late in the year; because, that the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eson</HI>'s, or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Muessons.</NOTE> Winds of the Season were almost pas∣sed already: After having well dispu∣ted upon this subject, they tack'd about to return to <HI>Portugal,</HI> and having sailed
<PB N="209" REF="160"/>
some time, the Captain <HI>Mor,</HI> who had a mind to make himself by this Voyage, seeing himself at that time Chief Commander of the Fleet, threatned the Master and Pilot with ill Lan∣guage, and commanded them to Tack again for the <HI>Indies:</HI> This was in the night, and thereupon Fires were made for a signal for the other Vessels to re∣turn; but we were not long together in Consort; for the rest knowing the Viceroy to be Dead, separated from us; and each held theirs a part, we conti∣nuing alone until we came to the Isles of <HI>Angoche,</HI> near the River of <HI>Cumana,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cumana.</NOTE> where we found the <HI>St. Anthony</HI> and <HI>St. Bartholomew</HI> Galleys: We held then our Course, tho' our Men dying every day of the <HI>Lovende;</HI> At last we ap∣proached the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> see∣ing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cape de</HI> Bonne Es∣perance. Alcatraz. Mangues de Velours▪</NOTE> the signal of <HI>Alcatraz</HI> and <HI>Mangues de Velours; Alcatraz</HI> are Birds like Sparrows; <HI>Mangues de Velours</HI> are Birds like Cranes, having the bottom of their Bellies, and Backs white; and the end of the Wings, Tail, and Neck, black; and these Birds continually keep above 80 Leagues round about the Cape. These Signals did a little chear us up,
<PB N="210" REF="161"/>
and encouraged us to come nearer to this so dangerous and tempestuous <NOTE PLACE="marg">Furious Tempest.</NOTE> place: For coming there, we had the most furious and greatest Storm that I ever saw; Our Carrack was about 2000 Tun, one of the Gallantest Ships in all <HI>Portugal,</HI> having been built a∣bove 30 years, and yet seemed to be but like a simple Boat, amongst these high and dreadful Waves. We needed little Fore-Mast to the Wind, and 30 or 40 Mariners at the Stern. In this Stormy Weather we could not keep our Ship with Wind, and were about a 100 Persons, 50 on each side, to Devise how to get again before the Wind, which we had lost. Our Deck was covered all over with Water, and it was impossible to get any farther than the Planks of the Ship, either behind or before. Amongst these Mi∣series and Calamities we expected no∣thing but Shipwrack, committing our selves to the Divine Mercy; and made a General Procession Praying Devout∣ly to God, that he would preserve us from this imminent Danger; besides, we could no longer resist, because of the weakness and sickness of our Men:
<PB N="211" REF="161"/>
But God of his Goodness heard our Prayers, appeasing by little and little this great Tempest, which we had so long endured; so that having passed this dangerous place, we descried the Cape of <HI>Aigu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lles,</HI> which made us judg <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cape de</HI> Aiguilles.</NOTE> that we had passed that of <HI>Good-Hope▪</HI> and from thence we arrived at the Land of <HI>Natall,</HI> where it was very <NOTE PLACE="marg">Natall.</NOTE> tempestuous, and almost as dark as night: We found there boisterous Winds, and we were forced to labour day and night to avoid the <HI>Baixos ds los Judios,</HI> or <HI>da Judia,</HI> that is▪ the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Baixos de los Judias.</NOTE> Shelves of the Jews in the Channel of the Coast of <HI>Sofala,</HI> where there is a great many Ships lost, and where amongst others, happened that no less lamentable than memorable Ship wrack of the Ship called the <HI>St. James,</HI> in the year 1585. who going to <HI>Goa</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> split upon these Rocks, and of 250 Persons, not above 90 escaped, by different manners, with as much or more misfortune and miseries on Land as they had enjoy'd on the Sea: There was some Fathers, Jesuits, and Do∣minicans cast away there, and others saved themselves. The strange and
<PB N="212" REF="162"/>
lamentable circumstances of the Ac∣cidents, have rendered this Shipwrack the most remarkable that ever hap∣pened in these Seas; which is the rea∣son that these Rocks are so much feared, which are like great heaps of sharp Stones and spikes of White Coral, and commonly covered with Water, so that they are not perceived until you are upon them, and the Ship splitting; but we by the help of God escaped them, so that having taken the height, and seeing our selves escaped, we made the best of our way towards this Harbour, where we found the two Gallies as I have said before, and knowing them again, we bore towards them, and cast Anchor 4 Leagues from the Isles, send∣ing the Boat to Land to hear news from <HI>Mosambique,</HI> which is about 25 Leagues from thence. There came on board us a <HI>Pangais,</HI> who told us how <HI>Mosambique</HI> had been Besieged by the Hollanders, and that it was not above 15 days since they had raised the Siege, and had taken the Galley of <HI>Good Jesus,</HI> which they burnt; and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollanders at</HI> Mosam∣bique.</NOTE> having known by this Gallion that we were coming, they presently retired;
<PB N="213" REF="162"/>
for those of the Gallion knew nothing of the Death of the Count <HI>de la Fera,</HI> nor of the dispersing of the Fleet, they being separated from us hard by the Isle of <HI>Madera:</HI> We weighed Anchor from thence, not finding above 5 or 6 Fathoms Water. As the Wind began to clear it behoved us to cast our An∣chors, and the next day to raise them again; this was the 15th of <HI>Sept.</HI> but the Currents of Water which run to∣wards the Islands of <HI>Angoche,</HI> were like to have swallowed us up: We endured a world of Hardships in casting and weighing Anchor, which left me some Blisters upon my Hands; and as weak as I was, I laboured with all my might to be rid of these dangerous passages: In the end, we cast and weighed our Anchors so, that we arri∣ved at <HI>Mosambique</HI> the 29th of <HI>Sep.</HI> and Anchored near the Isles of <HI>St. George,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrival at</HI> Mosam∣bique.</NOTE> which is 3 or 4 Leagues distant.</P>
<P>The next morning we Anchored near ths Fortress. As soon as we arrived at <HI>Mosambique,</HI> we understood how our Vice-Admiral had passed the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope</HI> immediately after us, when the Storm was a little allayed; and
<PB N="214" REF="163"/>
how they had seen a Sea-Monster pas∣sing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea Monster</NOTE> along by the Ship, which was of a strange form and wonderful great∣ness: He blowed and snored with a great noise, and kept his Body in a round like a Pillar, carrying a thing like a Shield before his Head, and a Saddle upon his Back: As he passed close by the Ship, he made so terrible a noise, that they thought themselves all lost; but he left them, and they saw him no more.</P>
<P>Being then arrived at <HI>Mosambique,</HI> we were mightily astonished to find there nothing to Eat, being then so fallen away by the fatigue of the Sea<HI>:</HI> We went on shore, having Anchored the <HI>St. Bartholomew, St. Anthony, St. Je∣rome,</HI> and our own, which was the Admiral: They were there full five Months, waiting for the <HI>Muesson</HI> of VVinds to convey us to <HI>Goa.</HI> VVe endured there not a little; for as I have said, we could find nothing to live upon, there not being any Bread. The Sick were put in Cabins of Palm, some in the Fortress, and others in the City; but they Died by 10 and 15 a∣day, and there remained 735 Buried, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of the Dead.</NOTE>
<PB N="215" REF="163"/>
as the haplain of our Ship told me, who kept a List of them.</P>
<P>I went also on Shore, scarce able to go, and walked about the Streets look∣ing for something to Eat; but I could find nothing save some little Fishes fryed, which these <HI>Ethiopian</HI> VVomen sell about the Streets, with some Cakes of Meal Baked upon the Coals, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mocates.</NOTE> they call <HI>Mocates.</HI></P>
<P>I bought some of this Fish fryed in the Oyl of <HI>Gerselin,</HI> (a little Seed like Carraways, which they make Oil <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rape-Seed.</NOTE> of) which has a very ill Taste; Then retiring alone to make a Feast, and comforting my self the best I could, re∣lying wholly upon God: I demanded a little Water of these VVomen, who gave me some, but it was so Salt that I could scarce drink any of it; for they had drawn it out of a nasty VVell, which was hard by the place where I was; But they fetch the good VVater out of the Continent, at a place called <HI>Cabassie:</HI> There is indeed a little Spring, but it was little better than nothing.</P>
<P>After that I went again on Board the Ship; Then the next day I retur∣ned again to Land, to look for some

to lodge in, because the Hollanders had burnt all the Houses; and by chance I found a Soldier, who took me into his Lodging within the For∣tress, where I carried all my Materi∣als; But after having been there some days, as well to Purge my self, as to be cured of my Disease, comes some of the Servants of Captain <HI>Mor</HI> to look for me, and commanded me to follow them to speak with their Master: I followed them in abundance of pain, and they hastning me forward, which I did after the best manner I could through these Sands towards the Sea∣side▪ in the end, they laid me upon the Back of an <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> to carry me into his <HI>Almadie,</HI> which is a sort of a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Almadie.</NOTE> little Boat of the Country, made of a hollow Tree: They cast me within it as if I had been a Log of VVood; and one of the Serjeants Embarked with me: The Tide being come, he made the Blacks row, to bring me on board the Vice-Admiral St. <HI>Jerome:</HI> I was a long time in this <HI>Almadie,</HI> du ring the excessive heat of the Sun a-Noon-Day, and I expected to Die with Heat and Thirst, and bought a

<P>When I came on Board, he put me into the Hands of the <HI>Merigne,</HI> or Ser∣jeant of the Ship, who demanded of him how he would have me fastened; to which he answered, by the Neck, the <HI>Merigne</HI> opened the Collars of Iron, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Imprison∣ment of the Author, and his Misery.</NOTE> and caused me to lie down all along, and shut my Neck betwixt two pieces of Wood: But seeing me Sick, he had some Compassion upon me and gave me a Pillow to put under my Head: <HI>I</HI> was in this miserable Condition from the 7th to the 28th of <HI>October,</HI> at which time <HI>I</HI> was set at liberty.</P>

him; and the said <HI>Monomoptata</HI> had promised the Portugals to give them all they could Conquer. Now when this <HI>John Baptisto</HI> was come on Shore, upon the Faith of the Captain, who <NOTE PLACE="marg">John Bap∣tisto <HI>taken.</HI></NOTE> promised him that he should not have any harm done, he was immediately sent as a Prisoner to the Vice Admiral, and presently after I was taken as I have before given account, and found the said <HI>John Baptisto</HI> Prisoner, under Deck, not having then any Irons up∣on his Feet: He was mightily asto∣nished to see me fastned so as I was, and endeavoured to render me what Consolation he could, that I might take it patiently: But this was not all my Misery to be thus fastened by the Neck; for Hunger, Thirst, and the Disease of my Gums tormented me much more; for they would not so much as give me a little Water to Drink; And by ill fortune I had taken no Money along with me, not know∣ing where they would lead me; and had not in all above two Rials, one of which I was Robb'd of, and with the other I prayed the <HI>Merigne</HI> to buy me some little Fishes, if any passed by our

fallen out with this Captain, and would have fought him, upon a difference about the Sea-Provision of the Count <HI>de la Fera,</HI> which was worth very near 10000 Ducats, in Victuals, as well Flesh, Biscuit, Wines, Oil, as other Refreshments for the Sea; and this Captain, who was before Vice-Ad∣miral, and, since the Death of the Count, Admiral himself, had made use of some of them, and carried the rest to <HI>Mosambique,</HI> and there sold them. Don <HI>Louis</HI> seeing that he could obtain no Restitution of this wicked Man, he Embarked to go on his Voy∣age to <HI>Cumana,</HI> to the Conquest of the Gold, which this King, Enemy to <HI>Monomopata</HI> had; and Captain <HI>Mor</HI> thinking, that Don <HI>Louis</HI> upon his setting Sail would board the Ship where we were Prisoners, sent a great number of Soldiers and Cannoniers, with charge to fire at, and sink the <HI>Pangais</HI> of Don <HI>Louis,</HI> if he made the least shew to Board them. In the morning Don <HI>Louis</HI> having caused his <HI>Pangais</HI> to set sail, he put himself in a posture to Board our Ship; where∣upon the Cannoniers turned their
<PB N="222" REF="167"/>
Pieces, and the Soldiers with their Muskets cockt, to receive them; Some <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diffrrence betwixt the</HI> Portugals.</NOTE> said, let us Fire before they come on board us; others said that they would not Fire because those in the <HI>Pangais</HI> were their Countrymen, and their own Friends: In the end, Don <HI>Louis,</HI> (whether it was that he feared to be sunk, or that he trusted not too much to the Faith of the Portugals his Com∣patriots) went directly on in his Course. Whereupon the Captain sent for the Master Cannonier, causing him to be Imprisoned, and Irons clapt upon his Feet, bidding him prepare himself to be Hanged: But this Master Canno∣nier being a stout bold Fellow, and not at all astonished at these Threat∣nings, boldly told him that he con∣fessed himself he had more offended in Commanding, than he had done in Disobeying to Fire upon Don <HI>Louis.</HI></P>
<P>This being thus over, the next day in the evening, the Captain sent one of his Men to take off my Irons, who left me Prisoner below Deck, with 6 Soldiers to guard me, who followed me every where for fear that I should leap into the Sea to save my self.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="167"/>
When I saw my self a little more at liberty, I assisted the Secretary <HI>John Baptisto,</HI> with a little Biscuit cut into little Bits, being black, rotten, and mouldy, and much ado to get that: I raised up, as well as I could, the cover of the place where I was enclosed, and thus gave him some little Bits, which was no small help to him.</P>
<P>But as God never forsakes his Ser∣vants in their Afflictions, the said <HI>John Baptisto</HI> told me in Latin, that he had found means to open the Pad-Locks of his Irons, and to take them of; and had also met with a Pipe of Wine, but could not get any of it without a hollow piece of Tinn, which he would use, putting a Stick through it with some Tow or Flax at the end, like a Sponge, and thus to draw out the Wine: I discovered this Business to the <HI>Merigne,</HI> who kept us Prisoners, and who was very well satisfied to have his part thereof, and not to say a word, getting me a Burrage of Lea∣ther, which I gave to the said <HI>Baptisto</HI> at night, when the Soldiers were busie at their sports above us, and be∣fore the Lamp was lighted<HI>:</HI> This
<PB N="224" REF="168"/>
Wine was no small help to us, and I believe that without it we could searce∣ly have subsisted any longer; for I sopped in private a little Biscuit in this VVine, which heartned me mightily.</P>
<P>About 5 days after, when Don <HI>Louis d' Alves</HI> was gone, <HI>John Baptisto</HI> was taken out from under the Hatches, and was left under the Deck with me, but not without Irons fastned on his Feet, when, as for me, I had no longer either Collars or Irons: Now one day as I was walking backwards and forwards upon the Deck, I by good fortune found under a Cannon, a Stone Bottle full of Syrop of Gilli-flowers; this I communicated to the <HI>Meregne,</HI> who took and kept it up for us both: I made use of this Syrop very often, as well to drink as to sop a little Bis∣cuit therein, and in a little time I perceived my Gumbs to grow better, and my Legs began to stretch, which was no small comfort to me; in short, I was quite cured of my Disease, also making use of some Remedies which I took out of a Chest full of Medecines which I found one day below Deck quite open.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="168"/>
Having continued about 22 days in this fashion; the Captain came one night very late on Board, and then I took occasion to Discourse him, to know what he had a mind to do with me, and why he let me thus languish; He made me answer, that I should come on Shore with him, to speak with Captain <HI>Mor.</HI> The 28th of the same month we went to see Captain <HI>Mor,</HI> who demanded of me, wherefore I came, and having answered, that the Captain had brought me to speak with him, he bid me wait till the next day, and commanded the Captain to take me to his Lodging.</P>
<P>The next day being come, he car∣ried me to Captain <HI>Mor:</HI> Then Cap∣tain <HI>Mor</HI> enquired of me if I had liber∣ty to pass into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and where my Licence was; I told him I had left it with the Proveditor of the House of <HI>India;</HI> Then he asked me if I knew any one at <HI>Mosambique,</HI> I told him no▪ Then he said do not go out of this Island without my Licence first had▪ and gave me a Line or two to the Re∣gister, and I had my Chest again, but my Money was gone.</P>
<P><PB REF="169"/>
After all these Troubles, walking one day about the Island, I went to visit a Portugal Gentleman of my ac∣quaintance, who lodged in a <HI>Horte,</HI> or Garden of <HI>Francisco Mendy,</HI> Judge of the Orphans: These two offered me a place to make a Cabin of Palm▪ the which I gladly accepted; and went to Lodge there; tho' the Lizards and Ants came quite under my Beds▪head▪ This <HI>Francisco Mendy</HI> kept Slaves, and sent me every day a great many Pre∣sents▪ He had a great mind that I should stay and live there, promising to give me one of his Nieces to Wife, Daughter to the Captain of <HI>Cumana,</HI> from whence the Gold comes; But I had no to mind tarry there, but rather pursue my Voyage to the <HI>East Indies.</HI></P>
<P>After having suffer'd considerably in this place, being ready to Embark, <HI>I</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pau d' A∣nac <HI>Wood good for the Disease of</HI> Antac.</NOTE> went to the Firm-Land of <HI>Cabassiere,</HI> to look▪ for a Barrel of Water, and a Root called by the Portuguese <HI>Pau d' Anac,</HI> that creeps along the Ground, and resembles much the Birth-Wort very long, bearing little long Pears, green and tender: The Root of it hath a wonderful Virtue in curing a Disease

called <HI>Antac,</HI> gotten by having to do with the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Women, and there is no other Remedy whereby to be exempted from Death but this: The Root is taken, ground, with clear Wa∣ter, of the weight of a Crown, which makes the Patient sweat so, that in a short time it Cures him. 'Tis a little bitter, and yet the Taste and Smell is agreeable enough. I bargained with some of these Blacks to fill me a Sack therewith, who led me into the Woods to look for it.</P>
<P>Going along with them I found a thousand sorts of Plants and Fruits to me unknown: At last we entered into a little Field, where we found some Blacks keeping of Corm for fear of the Elephants, who have Ropes which reach the length of the Corn, with Stones hanging thereon; As soon as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner to Hunt the Elephants.</NOTE> the Elephants approach, they shake these Stones against one another, which makes such a noise, that it frights the Elephants away: In the night they make Fires, which these Animals fear mightily. They make a little Lodge at the top of a Butt, and there watch by turns.</P>
<P><PB REF="170"/>
Having seen this, we retired to the Habitation where they had prepared my Dinner<HI>:</HI> There I made the Seamen Drink so much that they had like to have overturned our Boat. This Li∣quor was called <HI>Sura,</HI> a sort of Wine made of Palms; and I was mightily troubled to see these <HI>Ethiopians</HI> so puz∣zeled that they could scarce put up the Sails; and in the mean time the Boat was full of Water: One of the Wives of these Blacks tumbled into the Sea, but I recovered her, otherwise she had been Drowned. These Men under∣stood not one another they were so Drunk; but as good fortune would have it, the <HI>Mocadon,</HI> or Guider of the <HI>Almadie,</HI> was not so Drunk as the rest. 'Twas looked upon as a Miracle how we passed from <HI>Great Cabassiere</HI> to the little one, where there was a thousand Nets, Trees, and Branches, fixed all along the Coast to catch Fish withall.</P>
<P>Having then more happily than pru∣dently passed as far as the <HI>Little Cabas∣siere,</HI> we went on Shore to provide fresh Water; but there was none but in a great Well where there was but little neither: The Mariners were
<PB N="227" REF="170"/>
there making Provision of Water, so that I could not have any till night.</P>
<P>The night being come, and not knowing where to Lodge, these <HI>Ethi∣opians</HI> led me to a place above a League and a half from thence, but the People would not receive us, so that we were forced to return to the Port by reason of bad Weather: At last, being ar∣rived at the Port, I laid me down in the <HI>Almadie,</HI> covering my self with my Cloak, where I endured the Rain all the night.</P>
<P>The next morning we hoised Sail, and sailed directly upon the Banks, from whence we had much ado to es∣cape: In the end, being come off there from, with a great deal of trouble, and the Wind carrying us by force to∣wards the Main-Sea, which did us that favour as to bring us near to the Chapel of the Bullwork, where being come, I made a Vow, never to trust my self with such Mariners again, who made me run the greatest hazard I ever had in the whole Voyage: I or∣dered my Water to be brought into my Cabin, and prepared my self for the Embarkment to <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="171"/>
Whilst I was in this place, there <NOTE PLACE="marg">White Prince of the Blacks.</NOTE> came the Son of an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> King, from a great distance in the Continent, to see some of his Kindred: His Father and Mother were black, and he was white and fair▪ He brought with him one of his Brothers, who was black, and some Slaves: They came both into my Ca∣bin, telling me, that having heard say there was white Men at <HI>Mosambique,</HI> they came purposely to see them.</P>
<P>The Portugals made him a very good Reception, to the end they might have Free-Traffick in his Fathers Country: 'Twas said his Mother had two other White Children; but that his Father killed them, saying, they must needs be by some other Man; and that as he came into the World with this colour, his Father had determined to kill him also; but one of his Friends persuaded him to the contrary by tell∣ing him that it was by Divine Per∣mission, and so was saved. His Mo∣ther had possibly had these Men in her Imagination which were said to be at <HI>Mosambique,</HI> or else had happened to her by some other Course of Imagi∣nation. He was not in the least Tann'd
<PB N="228" REF="171"/>
or Burnt with the Sun, and was about 20 years of Age, and his Brother about 18. They visited me 2 or 3 times in my Cabin, and I gave them to Eat and Drink of what <HI>I</HI> could have in the Country, at which they seemed to be very well Content.</P>
<P>I remember that being at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> I heard a Story of such a like thing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>History of a black</HI> Genoway.</NOTE> which happened at <HI>Genoua</HI> not long be∣fore, of which they made a Song in form of a Romance, which I heard Sung in <HI>Portugal.</HI> There was a rich <HI>Genoua,</HI> who was Married to a very honest and virtuous Woman, of one of the best Houses in <HI>Genoua,</HI> who ha∣ving conceived some displeasure upon the account of one of her Black Slaves which had been gotten with Child by another Negro Slave, she imprinted that so deeply in her Imagination, that being with Child her self, she was brought to Bed of a black Child▪ but the angry Father believing that she had dishonoured her self with some Negro, was resolved to kill her; but she fled away to her Friends. Where∣upon he gave charge to one of his Ser∣vants to go and leave the Child some∣where,
<PB REF="172"/>
or to kill it: But the Servant moved with Compassion, (besides the Mother had recommended it to him) saved the Child, and caused it to be brought up, making the Husband be∣lieve he had made it away: A little while after, this <HI>Genoua,</HI> fore vexed with Spite and Anger, forsook <HI>Genoua,</HI> and retired into <HI>Barbary,</HI> resolving to turn Turk, and live in <HI>Algier.</HI> In the mean time the poor Disconsolate Mo∣ther took care to bring up this Child to years of Discretion, and gave him Order to go seek his Father through the World; for none knew what was be∣come of him. This young Black be∣ing upon the Sea, was taken by Cor∣sairs, and carried to <HI>Argier</HI> to be sold, where he was bought by his own Fa∣ther; but being troubled to see him∣self become a miserable Slave, his Fa∣ther asked him whence he was, who learned of him the whole History of his Birth, at which being astonished, he acknowledged him for his Son, and resolved to quit the Country, and re∣turn with him to <HI>Genoua,</HI> and to be reconciled to his Wife: Wherefore having secretly provided for his depar∣ture,
<PB N="229" REF="172"/>
resolved to embark all his choicest things, and what he esteemed the most, they departed one night out of <HI>Algier</HI> in a Boat; but as ill fortune would have it, they were taken by <HI>Corsairs,</HI> by whom they were both cruelly Massacred: Such end had the Adventure of this poor Black.</P>
<P>But to return again to our Embark∣ment at <HI>Mosambique;</HI> The Weather of <HI>Muesson</HI> being come, (which is a Wind <NOTE PLACE="marg">Muessons.</NOTE> that comes at a certain Season of the year, for there are but two sorts of Winds which raign in these Parts of <HI>India,</HI> East, and West; Don <HI>Estevan</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Don</HI> Este∣van de Tayde.</NOTE> <HI>de Tayde,</HI> Governor of <HI>Mosambique,</HI> caused his <HI>Pangais</HI> to be made ready, burthen 30 Tuns, more or less, and to be laden with <HI>Bretangis</HI> and <HI>Conte∣rie: Bretangis</HI> are a certain kind of Callico, dyed blue, and of a dark Vio∣let; <HI>Conterie,</HI> are Beads of Glass or Amber, as well good as counterfeit, which is the Merchandize usual a∣mongst these <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> who in ex∣change give Gold, Ambergreece, Eli∣phants Teeth, and other Things which these Countries of <HI>Couama</HI> produce, and the Cape of <HI>Courante,</HI> where these <HI>Pangais</HI> go.</P>
<P><PB REF="173"/>
Now, <HI>Don Cristoval de Porogne,</HI> alias Captain <HI>Mor,</HI> seeing these <HI>Pan∣gais</HI> ready to depart, went with his Soldiers in Boats to take them, and bring them to Anchor along by the Gallions of the Fleet, which was near by: The which <HI>Don Estevan</HI> perceiv∣ing from the Fortress, was mightily offended at; but not having Soldiers sufficient to go Succour, and Recover his <HI>Pangais,</HI> he commanded his Canoniers to Fire upon the <HI>Pangais,</HI> to sink them, not careing for the Loss of his Mer∣chandise; so he might but sink Captain <HI>More</HI> also, at least to do him some mis∣chief<HI>:</HI> The Canoneer took his Aim, and was going to fire one of the great Canons<HI>:</HI> But as good fortune would have it, both for one and the other, nothing but the Priming took Fire▪ and hereupon the principal of the City of <HI>Masambique,</HI> ran in all hast upon the Ramparts to appease Don <HI>Estevan,</HI> who was resolved to sink them all, and promised him to procure the <HI>Pangais</HI> out of the Hands of Captain <HI>Mor.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason that moved this Cap∣tain to do thus, was nothing but Mal∣lice and Revenge, to make the <HI>Pangais</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="173"/>
lose the opportunity of the Voyage, to the no small damage of <HI>Don Estevan,</HI> to whom it had been above an hun∣dred thousand Crowns Loss for that year, for as much as he could not have sent the <HI>Pangais</HI> at any other time to bring back the Profits which he uplifts every year from those Countries of <HI>Covama.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, he had endured a long siege of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in this place: At last the accord was made betwixt him and Captain <HI>More,</HI> and he sent his <HI>Pangais</HI> to their accustomed Traffick; but yet they still retained betwixt them∣selves a secret hatred, and ill-will; Since which time <HI>Ruy de Mello</HI> came to relieve Don <HI>Estevan</HI> of his Govern∣ment; his three years being Expired.</P>
<P>This Country of <HI>Covama</HI> is the Finest of all <HI>Africa,</HI> from whence the best Gold is brought, and in the great∣est quantity; insomuch, that the Cap∣tain of <HI>Mosambique</HI> during the three years that he Commands there, may carry away from <HI>Mosambique, Sofala,</HI> and <HI>Covama,</HI> above three hundred thousand Crowns, without reckoning that which he Pays to the Soldiers, and

by a Rope; The Captain not being <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pitious Ac∣cident of a Ship.</NOTE> able to hold so well as the rest, fell into the Sea, and they within were ready to cut of his Hands when he caught hold of the Boat; but one among the rest, crying out, 'twas the Captain, saved him: Several were kept off with Swords, and had their Hands cut as they laid hold on the Boat; There was but 16 Persons out of 300 saved. The Boat endeavoured to gain the Cape of <HI>Coarrants,</HI> and sailed above 400 Leagues before they arrived at the place designed▪ but in the end they came to <HI>Mosambique,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Goa,</HI> where I was told this accident.</P>

<P>The Carrack called the <HI>Palm</HI> was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mogincal▪ <HI>Woman-Fish.</HI></NOTE> lost at <HI>Mogincal,</HI> where the Blacks Fish for <HI>Pisce Mulier,</HI> which is to say Wo∣men Fish: This Fish resembles a Wo∣man, having the Privy Parts after the same manner, and carrieth her young under her Fins, which are on each side, serving for Arms, and goes often on Land, and is there disburthened of her young: The Blacks who Fish, are to swear not to have to do with these
<PB REF="176"/>
She-Fishes<HI>:</HI> Their Teeth are of great Virtue, (as I have experienced) against Hemorhoids, Bloody Flux, and hot Fe∣vers, in rubbing them against a Marble, and agitating it with Water, and so to be Drunk. These Blacks are extream fond of these Fishes, and refresh them∣selves by having Communication with them. These <HI>Pisces Mulieres</HI> have a hideous Face, like the Snout of a Hog, and all the Body like a Fish.</P>
<P>These People also Eat human Flesh, for which they are called <HI>Macone:</HI> 'Tis <NOTE PLACE="marg">Macone.</NOTE> said they drank the Blood of the Hol∣landers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbarity of the Blacks.</NOTE> when the Portugals made a Salley out of <HI>Mosambique;</HI> And a Sol∣dier of that place told me, that he saw a Black cut the Throat of a Hollander that remained upon the place, and swal∣lowed down the Blood hot. They are very hardy and couragious in War, fearing neither Sword or Dart; yet there are some Cowards.

<P>As for the Carrack called <HI>Oleveira,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oleveira <HI>Carrack.</HI></NOTE> she was lost near the Isles <HI>Quemades,</HI> not far from <HI>Goa,</HI> being so close pursued by the Hollanders, that they were con∣strained to put out the Boat and save themselves by going a shore, setting Fire to their Ship.</P>
<P>The Carrack named the <HI>Salvation,</HI> was carried towards the Coast of <HI>Ara∣bia</HI> to the Confines of the <HI>▪Abassins,</HI> and was there also Shipwrackt. I believe this happened through the Villany of the Master and Pilot, who having a mind to Inrich themselves with the Money of private Persons, and the <HI>Ca∣vedal,</HI> which is that of the King's for the lading of Peper, run purposely a ground upon the Coast: Then was it time for every one to save himself, taking with him his Money and Arms; not think∣ing to lade themselves with Victuals. The Master and Pilot agreed before to put the Money into the Boat, with some Victuals and Arms, and some of their Confidents, went to cross the
<PB REF="177"/>
Coast, passing the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> as far as the Persian Gulf, to recover <HI>Ormus:</HI> When this was known at <HI>Goa,</HI> they dispatch'd Gallies after them, and were taken to∣wards <HI>Ormus,</HI> and brought Prisoners to <HI>Goa,</HI> whilst I was there.</P>
<P>The rest (who were about 400 white <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Strange Adventure of the Por∣tugals in</HI> Ethiopia.</NOTE> Men and 300 Negro Slaves▪ set them∣selves in order to march along the Coast, and recover a certain Port of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> to Embark for the <HI>Indies:</HI> But as they marched with Colours displayed, and crying * <HI>Sautiago,</HI> think∣ing to make the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> afraid of them, but it fell out to the contrary: Insomuch that being fatigued with Hunger, Thirst and weariness, and troubled with the Enemy behind, every one was forced to shift for him∣self, and the hindermost were killed by the <HI>Ethiopians:</HI> The rest who saved themselves fell into the hands of a most barbarous King, who seeing so many Blacks of their own Nation Captives amongst these Portugals, Hypocriti∣cally told them, that if they would tender their Arms, they should receive no hurt; They believing that, and see∣ing themselves encompassed about on
<PB N="234" REF="177"/>
every side, delivered up their Arms, and presently this <HI>Abassin</HI> King caused them to be taken, and led one after another into a great place before his Pallace, and afterwards having strip∣ped them stark-naked, ordered them to sit down in a Ring, and caused an Herald to Proclaim their Death, say∣ing, that it was his Pleasure to have all their Heads chopt off before his People.</P>
<P>But it happened by chance that in the same Ship that was thus lost, there was a Persian Ambassador who had been sent into <HI>Europe</HI> from the great <HI>Sophy</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> to demand succour of the Christian Princes against the Turk. This Ambassador having been well received, and amongst others by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> with noble and rich Presents, he returned in this Ship by the way of the <HI>Indies.</HI> I saw him at <HI>Lisbon</HI> march about the City in great State, and had his Turbant covered with precious Stones. Now this Am∣bassador, who saved himself among these poor Wretches, fell upon his Knees before the King, desiring, that he would please to give these Chri∣stians their Lives, seeing he had taken
<PB REF="178"/>
from them all they had, and suffer them to Embark in some Port of his Coun∣try; telling him amongst other things, that if he knew but the Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> he would not offer them the least Injury, and that their Prince was able in a little time to Ruin him. The King was a little pacified at these Words, and told the Ambassador that for his Sake he would give them their Lives, on condition they▪ would pre∣sently depart his Dominions, or else he would put them to Death.</P>
<P>The Portugals seeing this, were not a little glad to have their Lives saved, got away Naked as they were, and Embarked in a Ship of an <HI>Arabian,</HI> Trafficking upon the Coast of <HI>India,</HI> who gave them Victuals and Passage upon hopes to be recompenced at <HI>Goa;</HI> and being arrived, the Master came to demand his Hire and Charges, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Office ill requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</NOTE> was Laughed at. He came to the Viceroy <HI>Andre Furtade de Mendoce,</HI> but could not get any thing.</P>
<P>One of these Seamen that were saved being my Friend, told me, That the Master Cannonier mightily lamented the loss of a Stone of a strange Virtue
<PB N="233" REF="178"/>
and excellent Odour, for having it a∣bout <NOTE PLACE="marg">Odoriferent Stone.</NOTE> him, he seemed to have a Scent of Musk and Ambergreece: The Vir∣tue was such, that being Soaked in Water, it was an excellent Remedy against any Disease, and had experi∣enced it upon several of their Men, who as soon as they drank of the Water wherein it was soaked, found them∣selves presently eased, and were cured according to the quantity which they took. The aptain would have given him a 1000 Duckets for it, but he would not take under 3 or 4000. He came by it one day as they made a Halt, taking his Harquebuss, and go∣ing about the Woods to shoot some∣thing to Eat, he found an Animal of the bigness of a Deer, but a little higher, who had two Horns below the Eyes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Animal carrying an excellent Stone.</NOTE> and had the fortune to shoot him in the Head: This Beast gave a leap to run upon him, but he fell down dead. He and his Companions cut him up to Roast him upon the Coals; and as he was going to Eat some of the Pluck, he found this Stone in a little bag, which at first he made no account of; but having washed it he found it of so cu∣rious
<PB REF="179"/>
and polished bright colour, and of so sweet a smell, that he kept it up carefully. The Coast of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> is full of excellent and odoriferous Herbs, and perhaps this Animal might feed thereupon, and that may be the cause of the Virtue of the Stone.</P>
<P>Thus was the greatest part of the Fleet lost: For of 14 Vessels there ar∣rived but 4 at the <HI>Indies,</HI> with a Hulk which served us for a Patach, yet not without having the Masts broke in pieces. There was a Carracon of the Fleet which sailed back for <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>But before we depart from this Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> I will relate the strange <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tragick Distory of</HI> Emanuel de Sosa. Sepulveda.</NOTE> Fortune which formerly happened to one <HI>Emanuel de Sosa,</HI> called <HI>Sepulveda,</HI> a Portugal Gentleman, and how he was lost upon this Coast of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> This Gentleman, who was rich, being in the <HI>Indies,</HI> fell in Love with the Daughter of one <HI>Garsias Sola,</HI> Captain of <HI>Bombain,</HI> (a Fortress of the Portu∣gals) esteemed one of the most Beau∣tiful Ladies of the East, and had many great Suters to Marry her; But he not being able to bring his Designs to pass, because of her Father, who would
<PB N="236" REF="179"/>
by no means give his Consent, tho' the Daughter was very willing he resol∣ved to rid himself of the Father, and for this cause parted one day from <HI>Goa,</HI> with some of his Sworn Companions, with whom he Embark'd, and coming late in the evening to <HI>Bombain,</HI> they watched their opportunity, so that they found this Captain walking along by the Sea, and there killed him. This was so secretly done that <HI>Sosa</HI> had no great trouble to attain to his Desires, Marrying this fair Orphan named <HI>Leo∣nor,</HI> whom he brought to <HI>Goa;</HI> where having for some time lived in pleasure with her, and having two Children by her, he had a desire to go with his Family to <HI>Portugal,</HI> to obtain from the King some Preferment greater than that which he had in the <HI>Indies:</HI> And for this cause, having bought a good Ship, and being Embarked at <HI>Cochim,</HI> with his Wife and Children, a great many Slaves, and others of his Train, he sailed away; But coming towards the Cape of <HI>Currants,</HI> and their Vessel running a-ground, they were forced to save themselves in the Boat: They thought to have arrived at the <HI>Little</HI>
<PB REF="180"/>
<HI>Cafala,</HI> where the Portugals have a Fort; for the great one is towards <HI>Mosambique;</HI> but they found them∣selves in a Country betwixt the Cape of <HI>Currants</HI> and that of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> where they were troubled with the Blacks of the Country along the Sea∣side. These Blacks not fearing the Harquebusses, killed a great number of them, the rest, amongst whom were <HI>Sosa,</HI> his Wife and Children, saved themselves by recovering the Country, and came at last into the Power of a King of these Blacks, who treated them very kindly; But when they de∣parted from thence, as they Travelled towards <HI>Mosambique,</HI> they fell into the Hands of the Enemies of this King, who did them all the Injuries imagi∣nable, in killing the most part, and striping the rest Stark-Naked: It was no small Grief to <HI>Sosa</HI> to see himself, his Wife and Children in this misera∣ble Estate, wandering about the De∣sarts and Burning Sands of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> without having wherewithall to Eat. Then began the just Judgment of God to fall on <HI>Sosa</HI> for the Murder of his Father-in-Law. He went up and
<PB N="239" REF="180"/>
down about the Woods seeking for Raisins to nourish himself, his Wife, and Children: But the greatest mo∣tive of Compassion was this poor inno∣cent Lady, who seeing her self Naked, covered her self with Sand, that she might not be seen in this Condition, and made the greatest Lamentations imaginable, oftentimes telling her Hus∣band, that their great Sins were the cause of so many Evils: But having continued some days in this Misery, after suffering the Death of her Chil∣dren, overwhelmed with Grief, Hun∣ger, and all sorts of Incommodities, was found dying by the wretched <HI>Sosa,</HI> re∣turning from his Quest; yet he recei∣ved her last Sighs, with Complaints and Lamentations of his loss; and knowing himself to be the cause of all these Misfortunes, went away like a Mad Man about the Woods, and was never after heard of. All the rest of his Company died after the same man∣ner, except one Portugal, who with great difficulty escaped, and arrived at <HI>Mosambique,</HI> where he related this sad Story, of which the Portugals have made a Romance. They who have
<PB REF="181"/>
Writ of the <HI>East-Indies</HI> have made am∣ple mention of this Tragical Accident of <HI>Sosa</HI> and his Wife, but they have omitted the Murder of his Father-in-Law, which was the occasion of draw∣ing the Judgment of God upon him.</P>
<P>But before we leave these Blacks it will not be improper to speak some∣thing of their Language, because it's <NOTE PLACE="marg">Language of the Blacks.</NOTE> different from all the other People of <HI>Africa.</HI> That of <HI>Mosambique</HI> is called <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> and can number no farther than Ten, and begin thus; <HI>Monti</HI> 1, <HI>Piri</HI> 2, <HI>Taton</HI> 3, <HI>Quinna</HI> 4, <HI>Chanon</HI> 5, <HI>Tandaton</HI> 6, <HI>Fongate</HI> 7, <HI>Nana</HI> 8, <HI>Quin∣da</HI> 9, <HI>Cohomy</HI> 10▪ They call the Head <HI>Mesora,</HI> the Ear <HI>Maro,</HI> the Nose <HI>Buo∣nom:</HI> the Mouth <HI>Muromoiu,</HI> the Face <HI>Cohope,</HI> the Arms <HI>Menio,</HI> the Feet <HI>Mirengi,</HI> the Hair <HI>Cici,</HI> the Teeth <HI>Mannon,</HI> and so of other Things.</P>
<P>But to return to the 4 Ships which remained from the Shipwrack, <HI>viz. Our Lady of Mount Carmel, St. Jerome, St. Anthony,</HI> and <HI>St: Bartholomew,</HI> with which we parted from <HI>Mosambique,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Departure from</HI> Mo∣sambique <HI>from</HI> Goa.</NOTE> and set sail for <HI>Goa</HI> the 20th of <HI>March</HI> 1609. And having then put out to the Main Sea, the 23th of <HI>March</HI> we saw the Isle of <HI>Comba.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="181"/>
This Isle is very high, and is to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Combo▪ <HI>Isle.</HI></NOTE> seen above 25 Leagues distance: After that, we passed the Line towards the <HI>Indies,</HI> the 5th of <HI>April,</HI> and the 12th, being at 4 Degrees on the other side the Line, we found an <HI>Arabian</HI> Ship <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arabian▪ Ship.</NOTE> which came from <HI>Dia,</HI> and was going to <HI>Mecca;</HI> Our Vice-Admiral made towards her, saluting her with 2 or 3 shot of Cannon to make her strike sail; the which they would not do, until they saw the Bullets fly, then they lo∣wer'd their Sails, and came to us. The Captain came with 6 or 7 Arabians of good Fashion, carrying with him a Pass-port from the then Vice-roy of the <HI>Indies:</HI> The Captain seeing this Pass∣port, durst not do them any harm, but having retained them 2 or 3 days, had great Presents from them, and sent to visit their Ship to see if there was any prohibited Goods therein, as Cinnamon, Cloves, and other things. There was about 700 Persons in the Ship, the most part Passengers, who were go∣ing in Pilgrimage to the Sepulcher of their Prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI> This Ship was said to be worth above Two Mil∣lions, for there was nothing but Mer∣chandize
<PB REF="182"/>
of Silk, and other curious and precious Things.</P>
<P>After this Encounter we passed the Mouth of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> near to the Isle of <HI>Socreta,</HI> on the 7th of <HI>May,</HI> and there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Socoreta <HI>Isle.</HI></NOTE> we had great Calms, which in regard of the want we were in for fresh Wa∣ter, and other Necessaries, much trou∣bled us. When we arrived at the Bar of <HI>Goa,</HI> we had but little Victuals left, and had we tarried but a little while longer we had all Died of Hunger: By the way we found a Ship which came from <HI>Chaoul,</HI> and was comman∣ded by an <HI>Arabian:</HI> We commanded him with Cannon Shot to lower his Sails; for he would not obey at first; and being come on Board us, Captain <HI>Mor</HI> made him Prisoner at the Poop, where he was for some time; but ha∣ving made some Presents to the Cap∣tain, he was let go, because he Traf∣fick'd with the Portugals: We kept two of these Mariners to serve us for the knowledge of the Coast, if by chance we should meet with contrary Winds. One of these Mariners shewed me a Bird no bigger than a Linnet, and told me, it never stirred from the Sea, and
<PB N="237" REF="182"/>
never went on Land but when the Fe∣male <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wonderful-Bird.</NOTE> laid her Eggs, she mounts up out of sight, and so lays her Eggs one at a time as she mounts up; after this Egg comes down tossing in the Air, which is very hot in that Country, be∣fore it falls into the Sea, 'tis Hatch'd; after which, the Sea nourisheth it; which I found to be very wonderful and rare in Nature.</P>
<P>The 26th of <HI>May</HI> 1609. we arrived <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrival▪ at</HI> Goa <HI>in the</HI> Indies.</NOTE> at <HI>Goa the Old,</HI> as they call it, and the 27th went on Land, being <HI>Ascension-Eve,</HI> to Dine at <HI>Pangin,</HI> before we should come to <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the Fleet arrived there, the Kings Packet was published, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Andre Furtano <HI>Elected Vice-roy.</HI></NOTE> was to be opened no where but at <HI>Goa,</HI> containing that in case the Vice-roy chanced to Die by the way, Senior <HI>Andre Furtado de Mandoze</HI> should be Elected; and if he was not there at that time, they should send for the Governor of the Isle of <HI>Seilan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Andre Furtado</HI> having thus been re∣ceived <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reys-Ma∣gos▪ <HI>or the Church of the three Kings.</HI></NOTE> for Vice-roy, I went to <HI>Reys-Magos,</HI> (which is the Church of the <HI>Cordelieres,</HI> where the Vice-roys com∣monly reside whilst Preparations are
<PB REF="183"/>
made for his Reception▪) to speak with him, and desire him to help me in my necessity: He made me answer that I should come to him when he was set∣led in his Government: But all this sig∣nified nothing, for I could never speak with him until such time as he sent for me to go with him to <HI>Portugal,</HI> being relieved of his Charge by <HI>Ruy de Talbe,</HI> who came the next year to <HI>Goa:</HI> He sent for me then by his Cup-Bearer, to come and speak with him at the Pass of <HI>Madre de Dios,</HI> half a League from <NOTE PLACE="marg">Madre de Dio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>or the Mother of God.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Goa;</HI> the which I did, and told me, if I would go along with him to <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> he would content me; to which I willingly agreed.</P>
<P>I went to live in his House till we Embarkt, which was in <HI>January</HI> fol∣lowing: It was in <HI>November</HI> when he sent for me to this Pass, where there was a Captain who kept the Passage so that none could go into the Main-Land without being marked in the Hand, except those of the Country, and the Portugals, who must have the Licence of the <HI>Coregidor.</HI> I desired then this Captain from <HI>Andre Furtado,</HI> to give me an <HI>Almadie,</HI> with Mariners,
<PB N="240" REF="183"/>
and a Naique for Guide, which he willingly did, and recommended me mightily to this Naique, telling him that I went to look for Herbs for <HI>An∣dre Furtado,</HI> which was true, and ac∣cordingly brought some which served him for Fomentation of the Opelation of the Spleen. Passing then to the Main-Land, we went by these Places in the Habitations of the Gentlemen <HI>Bramenis;</HI> and having demanded some Water to drink at the House of one of these People, he gave me some, but stayed to see if I drank without touch∣ing the sides of the Cup, the which I knew not, and Drank without any Ceremony, which the Son of this Gen∣tleman seeing, cried out as loud as he could to his Father, who was in a little place behind the House, who pre∣sently came running in great Ange, so that I was constrained to march of, and make clean the Cup by my Naique to appease them.</P>
<P>After that I passed by a Pagod or Temple, very well built, and entering therein I found one of the Natives stark-naked, adorning their Idol with Flowers, which had a Head like a
<PB REF="184"/>
Calf, when presently an old Woman amongst them cried out to me, Why I came in there with my Shooes; my Naique excused me in telling her that I knew not the Custom.</P>
<P>As for the Pay-gods, they have seve∣ral <NOTE PLACE="marg">Paygods.</NOTE> sorts of them; Some for War, others for Peace, and for Love, where the Maids coming to be Married, are brought to be Des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oured; and their Idol hath the Privy Parts like a Man. The Damsels, who serve these Pay∣gods like the Vestal-Virgins, continue there from 10 to 20 years of Age, and Dance all night long, carrying lighted Lamps in their Hands, and go to Sleep round about their Idols. I saw there very beautiful Girls and Women They Marry their Daughters at 8 or 9 years of Age; when they are once past 12 or 13, they are not regarded, because they believe them to continue no longer Maids, considering the heat of the Country: At the end of 20 years, these Religious Women that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Indian <HI>Women Re∣ligious.</HI></NOTE> have thus served the Pay-gods, are kept in a certain place the rest of their Lives.</P>
<P>After I had gathered some Herbs which I had occasion for, we went to
<PB N="241" REF="184"/>
a little Habitation of Gentiles, where I demanded by my <HI>Truch-man,</HI> if they had any Victuals to give us for our Money, for there is no Inns or Taverns there; but there were some little Shops where they sold Fruit, and other things fit to Eat: These Gentiles ha∣ving Compassion on me, there was a Woman, who put me under a Gallery of her House, where there was a Nap∣kin full of Leaves and Plantane, ac∣commodated with Thorns; then she threw me some Rice thereupon, with a certain Sauce which they call <HI>Caril,</HI> I Eat all this, and when I was about to Drink out of a little Vessel of Copper that they had given me full of Water, they began to cry out upon me, because I touched it in Drinking, for they never touch the Cup in Drink∣ing, only heaving it up with the Server whereon it stands, and so Drink.</P>
<P>The Floor and Pavement of their Houses are composed with Cow-Dung, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ants trou∣blesome.</NOTE> which they make look exceeding bright, and think that it keeps away the Ants, which are there in abun∣dance; and they can keep nothing free from being destroy'd by these lit∣tle
<PB REF="185"/>
Animals, to prevent which they have also Cupboards bore upon Piles, set in Vessels full of Water, where the Ants drown themselves by thinking to mount up. Near to this Habitation I found a great Tree, laden with <HI>Ta∣marins,</HI> of which I gathered a few: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamarins.</NOTE> They had yet nothing but a sower Taste, I carried away the Husk, which are almost like French-Beans, but lar∣ger and greater.</P>
<P>Now as I returned by a very De∣sart Place, I saw some of these Gentiles running in great haste; and having caused my Truch-man to ask what ailed them, they answered, that their Fa∣ther was gone to Drown himself, a little after I saw them return, bringing back their Father, and Comforting him after the best manner they could: He was troubled for some Misfortune that had happened to him. It is a common thing with these People to Drown or Poison themselves, or to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Indians <HI>subject to Dispair.</HI></NOTE> Die after some such way, when any Accident happens to them.</P>
<P>As for the Women, 'tis the Custom, that when the Body of their Dead Husbands are Burnt, they cast them∣selves
<PB N="242" REF="185"/>
into the Funeral Pile, and Burn <NOTE PLACE="marg">Women who burn them∣selves.</NOTE> themselves, after being first adorned with their richest Accoutrements and Jewels, Dancing at the Sound of In∣struments, and thus Die with a won∣derful Constancy, speaking in the Fire to the very last: Those who do not this are held Infamous so long as they live, not daring to shew themselves before others, nor to appear before their Friends and Kindred. Such as have a weaker Courage Poison them∣selves, seeing their Husband Dead, and are Burnt together with him.</P>
<P>Tis remarkable that the Body of the Woman hath such an Oyley Pro∣perty, that one Body will serve like Oil or Greese to consume the Bodies of 5 or 6 men. The Moors and Maho∣metans who inhabit the Main-Land of <HI>Goa</HI> towards <HI>Pichelin,</HI> do not allow this sort of Cruelty in the Women; but when they see they cannot obtain this favour, they Poison themselves.</P>
<P>This Custom of Burning themselves hath continued, as they say, ever since a certain Gentile King, who reigned a∣mongst them; who seeing how all the Men of his Kingdom died, and know∣ing
<PB REF="186"/>
that it was their Wives which Poisoned them, to have other Hus∣bands; and that those who had Chil∣dren should continue alive to take care of them, but without Power ever to Marry again, instituted this: They ob∣serve this very strictly, and do nothing but Groan, Weep and Lament, during the rest of their Life; and at certain hours of the day and night, howl and lament after so strange a manner, that 'tis a great pity to hear them.</P>
<P>As for my part I was sometimes Deafened with the clamours and noise of some or other who had lost Husband or Children▪ I have heard a <HI>Bramin</HI> say, (who had turned Christian) that they who have lost a Child, mourn and lament 20 years entire: He told me also, that a certain Woman▪ of those who us'd to serve the Pay-gods, that after being retired into a House where they pass their time with Men, she entertained one who heated himself so with her, that he Died upon the spot, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolution of a Lover.</NOTE> at which she was so afflicted, that when they Burnt his Body, she Burnt her self with him, seeing he had Died for Love of her, tho' she was no other than a good Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="186"/>
As I returned from my little Voy∣age, I passed by a Valley where there was a very neat and pleasant Foun∣tain, which came out from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock flat and hollow, and the Water which came out run through little holes in the Rock: 'Twas impossible to empty it, though there was but very little Water therein: For in taking out that which was there, more runs out, like a strong and active Spring: After this, I went to Embark at a Paygod, which is in a certain place along by the River, it being so deep that 'tis im∣possible to find the bottom. They have made there large and spacious <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Foolish Opi∣nions of the</HI> Indians.</NOTE> Steps along by the side; and there the Gentiles come every year, 2 or 300 Leagues distant, to wash themselves at certain times, and sometimes there are assembled there above a 100000 Men, Women and Children, casting abundance of Fruit in this River, who believe that at the end of the year it comes again upon the Water.

As I Embarked by these Steps, I <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Voyage of the Author.</NOTE> returned to the <HI>Madre di Dios,</HI> from whence I set out about <HI>Dec.</HI> Then I made another little Voyage to the Main-Land of <HI>Pichelin,</HI> to procure some <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pichelin.</NOTE> Drugs and other Rarities of the Coun∣try, and took again my Truch-man▪ with the <HI>Almadie,</HI> and the Mariners which the Captain of the Passage had given me, who having expresly com∣manded them to Obey me, and to conduct me where I had a mind to go.</P>
<P>We departed in a very fine evening, and travelled all night, the Moon shining, insomuch that we arrived at <HI>Pichelin,</HI> a very pleasant City, where is a great number of Gentile Merchants, and belongs to <HI>Dealcan,</HI> it being some 4 Leagues from <HI>Goa:</HI> We went to the Lodging of one <HI>Manate,▪</HI> a Gentile, who received us kindly upon the Acquain∣tance he had with our Truch-man, and put me to lie under a little Pent-House, where an Indian Woman brought her Daughter to lie with me, as this <HI>Manate</HI> had counselled her; but this Girl not above 13 years of Age, seeing I would not touch her, sell to Weeping and Groaning, thinking to
<PB N="244" REF="187"/>
force me to have to do with her, and her Mother did all she could to appease her; I understood not the ground of all this Mystery.</P>
<P>The next morning, I saw a Jogue-Gentile, who was all perfumed with Incense, and stark Naked, squat up∣on his Tail before a Fire of Cow Dung, and with Ashes thereof all bepowered his Body, having long Hair like a Woman, which he held on the top of his Shoulders: This was the most hideous and monstrous Spectacle that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Strange fa∣shion of the</HI> Jogues.</NOTE> ever was seen: For he remained still looking on the Fire, without so much as turning his Head.</P>
<P>These sort of People are sometimes 4 or 5 days without any meat, and use extraordinary Abstinence: All these Gentiles, and especially the Bramins, never Eat any living thing, or that has had life, and will not taste of Red-Herbs, saying, that they have Blood in them; They Eat Rice and Milk, and call the Cow their Mother-Nurse. About the Desarts they have Hospitals where they Feed the Pilgrims that pass that way: When some rich Men <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hospitals amongst the</HI> Indians.</NOTE> Die they leave something to the Hos∣pitals.</P>
<P><PB REF="188"/>
To this purpose, I will relate what happened to one of my Friends, com∣ing from the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI> to <HI>Co∣chin:</HI> This was a Fleming, who was Married at <HI>Lyons,</HI> and had two Bro∣thers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cochin.</NOTE> Married at <HI>Goa,</HI> to the <HI>Metices</HI> of <HI>Cochin:</HI> These 3 were taken in the Ship <HI>Good Jesus</HI> by the Hollanders, who put them on Shore; And as they came along by the Sea-side, they had but one pair of Shoes amongst them three, the which they wore by turns: He who wore the Shoes went upon Land, and the two others, bare-footed, went in the Water along by the Shore, not enduring the Soles of their Feet upon the Ground, it was so hot and burn∣ing at that time<HI>:</HI> They were ready to Die with Hunger and Thirst, not find∣ing any thing to subsist upon in these Desarts: And being very weak, and in great Distress▪ they espied two Gen∣tiles, who ran towards them, crying out to them to stay a little; but they not knowing what they meant, feared at first that it was to Rob them, but having nothing to lose, they resolved to tarry, and these Gentiles being come to them, courteously offered them Meat <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Courtesie of the</HI> Indians</NOTE>
<PB N="245" REF="188"/>
and Drink, for which they thanked them, saying, they had no Money to pay for it: They spake by Signs▪ not being able to make them understand otherways: But these Gentiles pointed towards Heaven, as if they would have said, 'twas God who commanded them to do thus; so that these 3 easily con∣sented thereto, and afterwards pursued their Voyage<HI>:</HI> This shews how these Gentiles are content when they find occasion to do good to poor Travellers, they being all very pious People, who endure all sorts of Ignominy and Inju∣ries, such Lovers are they of Peace and Tranquillity. This Goodness and na∣tural Humanity of these poor Idola∣ters, abused in so many other things, is an excellent Lesson for Christians in∣structed in the True Religion, which they make so little account of, since the Natural Light of these blind Infidels, shames the Super-natural Gifts of those who profess Christianity.</P>
<P>After I had gathered together, and bought all the Drugs and other Things which might be of any use to me, I began to think of my return with my Truchman and Mariners; and going
<PB REF="189"/>
along the Coast, which was very green, pleasant, and abounding in all sorts of Plants; When I saw any Herb which pleased me, I commanded them to fetch it.</P>
<P>The Portugals put a thousand Af∣fronts upon these poor People, and sometimes they make shew as if they would kill some Bird, or other Animal, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Indians <HI>kill not Animals.</HI></NOTE> which these Gentiles have pity on, and presently buy them to set them at liberty: Yet since they have found out that the Portugals do this on purpose to have their Money▪ knowing their bad Intention, they buy not these Animals as they were wont to do.</P>
<P>When a Portugal has a mind to have <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rude Com∣portment of the</HI> Portu∣gals <HI>to∣wards the</HI> Indies.</NOTE> some new Cloths, he makes no more ado but goes to the Shop of an Indian, with a Tailor, and there chooses his Stuff; then orders it to be cut out in his presence, and when it comes to be paid, he bids the poor Gentile follow him to his Lodging to take his Money, where being come, he pretends that his Companion, who has the Key of his Chest, is not there; and so the other whatever he can say or do, can have nothing of him but this excuse: And
<PB N="246" REF="189"/>
2 or 3 days after, the Portugal tells him he owes him nothing: They use the same Tricks to all other Merchants, and Tradesmen: They have done as much to me, when I have paid any thing for them; for some time after they made as if they knew me not: Yet it ought not to be thought strange if they do thus in the <HI>Indies,</HI> since they play the same Pranks in <HI>Lisbon</HI> it self; where one of my Hosts told me, that one day having Dressed up a Hat for a <HI>Castilian,</HI> and asking him for his Mony, shewed him a Pistol cockt, telling him, if he had a mind to be paid, he must follow him into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he was going, and this was all he could get.</P>
<P>As soon as they arrive at the <HI>Indies,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nature and Quality of the</HI> Portu∣gals <HI>in the</HI> Indians.</NOTE> they make themselves Gallants, calling themselves <HI>Fidalgues,</HI> or Gentlemen, tho they be but Peasants and Tradesmen: They themselves relate, That a certain one among them named <HI>Fernando,</HI> who had kept Hogs in <HI>Portugal,</HI> coming to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and adding 3 Letters to his Name, caused himself to be called <HI>Don Fernando,</HI> and was in a little time so well known and esteemed amongst the Women <HI>Metices,</HI> that one having chosen
<PB REF="190"/>
him for her Servant, she caused him to Ride about with a Chain of Gold about his Neck, and a great many Slaves af∣ter him; But one day it happened that his Master's Son, whom he had served in his own Country for a Swine-heard, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Portugal <HI>Pride.</HI></NOTE> having met him in this Rich Equipage, riding about the Streets of <HI>Goa,</HI> sa∣luted him, saying in his own Language, <HI>Deos Guarde de Fernando Como Esta;</HI> which is to say, <HI>God save ye Fernando, how goes it:</HI> But the other making shew as if he knew him not, ask'd, who he was; to which the other made answer, Was not he the same who formerly kept Hogs for my Fa∣ther; This Gallant hearing this, draw∣ing him aside, told him, he was, and was here called <HI>Don,</HI> and was looked upon as a great Gentleman, praying him to hold his peace, and gave him Money; yet this hindered not his be∣ing known by several, who made their own profit thereof.</P>
<P>But since I am fallen upon this Dis∣course, I will add, that when these Portugal Soldiers first arrive at the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> wearing their Country Cloths, those who have been there a long time
<PB N="247" REF="190"/>
before, when they see them walk about the Streets, call them <HI>Reipol,</HI> laden with Lice, with a thousand other Jeers and Affronts: When I was there, these Newcomers durst not stir out of their Lodgings until they were dress'd like the other Indians; And then they know them no longer, using Majestick Gravity, and observing the <HI>Sossiego,</HI> after the Spanish manner, always ha∣ving their Boy, who carries their <HI>Pa∣rasol,</HI> or Cloak; without which they dare not come out of their Lodging, except they have a mind to be esteem'd <HI>Picaro's,</HI> or poor miserable Wretches; as in truth they are to those who know them: As long as they are there, in∣stead of vile and base, as they be, they esteem themselves all <HI>Fidalques</HI> and Noblemen, changing their more obscure Names to more Illustrious<HI>:</HI> I knew one who Enrolled himself for the War, and he changed his Name 3 or 4 times, as 'twas found out by the Secretaries and Registers of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>When they hear of any one that knows them, they are so wicked as to send to ask whether he knew such a one or not, and who he was, of what
<PB REF="191"/>
Cast or Race, and if noble and honour∣able, so that if the other answers, that he is some <HI>Picaron,</HI> or miserable Fel∣low, this Friend reports it to the other, and then for meer Spite, complots with his Associates against him who has told this Truth, and meeting him in the City at their advantage, give him so many Blows that they kill him, or leave him for Dead: This is the cause that one must take care how he tells the Truth of such who are enquired after: But on the contrary, if they tell all the glorious Things in the world of him, of his Nobility, Valour, Power, and other Qualities, tho' never so false; Then he of whom all this is meant, com∣ing to meet the other, immediately salutes him, Embraces his Thigh, and prays him always to say the same of him, and that he is wholly at his Ser∣vice, ready to reward him with his Life and Fortune.</P>
<P>When they have a mind to <HI>d'Accou∣chillar,</HI> or Slash any one with their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Revenge of the</HI> Portu∣gals.</NOTE> Swords, they send Notes to their Friends to desire their assistance against one who has offended them<HI>:</HI> If he to whom this Note is sent does not come,
<PB N="248" REF="191"/>
and excuses himself, because such an one is his Friend, they cry him about for a faint-hearted Coward; and 'tis he on whom they will wrack their Re∣venge, if he has not a care of himself▪ These are the Actions at this day.</P>
<P>One day standing at my Lodging Door in the Street of the <HI>Crucifix,</HI> I saw two Companies of Soldiers, the one coming from the <HI>Misericordia,</HI> and the other seeming from the <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> and drawing nigh one to the other, laid hands upon their Swords with great fury, but the Rascals did one another no harm, being the numbers were e∣qual<HI>:</HI> But when 10 or 12 meets with one or two, then you shall see them do wonderful Exploits.</P>
<P>There was one amongst the rest, who to shew himself a Champion, challeng'd another to fight him hand to hand, who appear'd but plainly with his or∣dinary Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: But the other wicked and false wretch, carrying with him a Harquebuss, presented it to give Fire, at which the first cryed out that he should kill him like a man of Valour, and not like a Coward▪ yet he would not hearken to this, but told him, that
<PB REF="192"/>
if he had a mind to have his Life given him, there was one thing he must do, and the other demanded, what it was; this Wretch who had his piece cockt, told him that he must deny <HI>Jesus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrible Trick.</NOTE> <HI>Cbrist,</HI> which the other having basely done, he firing, said to him, get thee the right way to Hell, and so parted.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible to tell the Wicked∣ness, Insolencies, and Irreverences they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Irreverence in the Churches.</NOTE> commit in the Churches during Di∣vine Service; which I have often seen, whilst they were saying Mass at <HI>Goa,</HI> hearing them speak out aloud, and crying so to one another, that none could hear any thing of the Service, making all that noise in the Indian Language, and bawling as if they were in a Fair, or in the Fields; and some will send their Slaves to fetch their <HI>Escritorio</HI> to take some Letters out <NOTE PLACE="marg">Escritorio</NOTE> to shew: Then when they see the Holy Sacrament raising, they give themselves 3 or 5 blows upon the Breast, and presently fall again to Bawling, Laughing, and Mocking as before: There is nothing amongst them but Usury, Covetousness, Theft, and strange Oaths, and such that the
<PB N="249" REF="192"/>
most subtile might be cozened and de∣ceived.</P>
<P>I have remarked that they have a sort of Honour amongst them, when they meet about the Streets, the lesser <NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Saluting.</NOTE> number gives way to the greater, and if they are but two, they must begin to Salute 3, when they meet 'em, and so of the others▪ And indeed I was once so deceiv'd; for, being in the company▪ of 2 or 3 of them, as we met with two others, not knowing their fashion, I began to Salute them first, for they were of my acquaintance; but the others check'd me for it, saying, I knew not the Custom, and for the future must take care how I did the like.</P>
<P>They go in the night, with their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Robberies at</HI> Goa.</NOTE> <HI>Carpausses,</HI> which are Dresses for the Head, after the manner of a Coat, pluck∣ing up and down the Vizard when they please; and about Supper-time go away to such Houses where they know there is something to take, knocking at the Door if 'tis shut, and enter if they find it open, their Faces hid, asking for the Master of the House, they demand of him to lend them 2 or 300 Cheraphins, otherways they will Kill him, and so carry away the best Things in the House▪</P>
<P><PB REF="193"/>
A Portugal Gentleman related to me how he had been thus Robb'd by that sort of People, as he was going to Sup∣per; For his Slave having opened the Door upon their telling him they had a word or two to say to his Master, en∣tering in by force, and leaving one at the Door, took at the first bout all the Plate which was upon the Table, de∣manding of him 200 Cheraphins if he had a mind to have them again, which he gave them, and so they went away. If the Justice goes to take them, they have great Bags of Cannon-Powder, with Matches tied about them, threat∣ning to throw them amongst those who offer to approach the Door.</P>
<P>The Portugals are grown so extream jealous of their Wives that you must <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jealousie of the</HI> Portu∣gals.</NOTE> not so much as look them in the Face; and if they see them but speak to any one, they presently Strangle or Poison them; and when they have Strangled them, they call their Neighbours to their Succour, saying, that a Swooning Fit has taken their Wife upon the Chair; But they never come again to themselves: Sometimes they send for a Barber to Blood them, saying, that they are not well; When the Barber is
<PB N="250" REF="193"/>
gone away, they undo the Fillet, and let he Blood run out until the poor mise∣rable Creature dies; and then also they call in the Neighbours, to see as they say, what a sad Disaster has happened to their Wife in Sleeping.</P>
<P>Others there are who take their Wives with them to Bath in some Brook or Pond, and there make them Drink their Belly full; and a little while after, send their Slaves to look for their Mistress, whom they find Drown'd, which the Husband knowing before, seems to be▪ mightily astonished and grieved at.</P>
<P>Thus in different ways, they make away their Wives, on the least suspicion, and afterwards relate the Story amongst one another<HI>:</HI> There are some who have thus made away 3 or 4 Wives.</P>
<P>But the Women also, when they think their Husbands entertain any other, rid themselves of them by Poison, or other∣ways, and make much use of the Seeds of <HI>Datura,</HI> which has a strange Virtue; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Datura <HI>Poison.</HI></NOTE> This <HI>Datura,</HI> or <HI>Dutroa,</HI> a sort of <HI>Stra∣monium,</HI> is a great and high Plant, bear∣ing white Flowers, like the <HI>Cisampelos,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cisampe∣los.</NOTE> but larger. Now he who takes too great a quantity thereof, Dies in a little time, laughing and weeping like a Fool.
<PB REF="194"/>
Thus the Women who have particular Friends, gave of this Herb to their Hus∣bands, mixing therewith other Drugs, which is such that the poor Husband falls into a Fury, and Raving, snatches <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Actions.</NOTE> up a Pike or Hallberd to guard the Door, without saying a word to such as come either in or out: Then the <HI>Seni∣ora</HI> or <HI>Lady,</HI> sends for her Gallant, and passes the time in presence of the Hus∣band until the Operation of the Drug (which continues about 24 hours) is over: He who has taken it, not re∣membring what he has seen or done, so mightily are his Thoughts and Mind agitated and troubled with this Herb.</P>
<P>As for the Slaves, 'tis pity to see the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel Cha∣stisement to the Slaves.</NOTE> cruel Chastisements they give them▪ For they run them through with dou∣ble Irons, then give them with a Cud∣gel, 500 blows at a time, and make them lie along the ground on their Bel∣ly, and then comes two, who by turns strike the poor Body as a Log of Wood, the Master Portugal or <HI>Metice</HI> being present, counts the Blows with his <HI>Rosaire:</HI> And if by chance they who thus strike are not strong enough to his mind, or have an inclination to spare their Companion, he causes them to be
<PB N="251" REF="194"/>
put in the place of the Patient, and to be soundly banged without any Mercy.</P>
<P>As I was in my Lodging at <HI>Goa,</HI> I heard nothing but Blows all the night long, and some weak Voice, which Breathed a little, for they stop their Mouth with a Linnen Cloth, to hinder them from crying out. After they have been well beaten, they cause their Bodies to be sliced with a Razor, then rub it with Salt and Vinegar for fear it should Fester.</P>
<P>They have another sort of punish∣ment which they call <HI>Pingar Viue,</HI> which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cruelty of the</HI> Portu∣gals.</NOTE> is to drop Lard put into a red hot <HI>Pelle,</HI> upon the Body of the poor Patient, stark naked and lying upon his Belly. The Parents of these miserable Wretches are sorry they brought them into the World, to feel such Torments, which pierces them to the very Entrails.</P>
<P>I have sometimes seen part of these Barbarous Cruelties which afflicted me so much, that I have still a horrour when I think thereof. There was one day a poor Indian Girl, who came run∣ning to my Lodging, crying out for help, and praying me to be a means to obtain Mercy; but I could not save her, to my great Sorrow; For she was
<PB REF="195"/>
taken and laid all along on the Ground and Bastinadoed without pity.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Metice</HI> Woman who had by these horrible Chastisements killed 5 or 6 Slaves, which she caused to be Buried in her Garden; And one day as she ordered another to be thus punished, he who gave her the Blows going to leave off, the miserable Crea∣ture in the mean time Died; and when <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, i.e. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive it her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive it her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x.</HI></NOTE> he told his Mistriss that she was Dead; no, no, she answered, she counterfeits, <HI>Daly Dalyes, Rapose Veille,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Lay on, lay on, 'tis an old Fox.</HI></P>
<P>Another had a Slave who was not vigilant enough; and ready to rise when she called her, her Mistress caused an <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>heard of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> Horse-Shooe to be nailed upon her Back, insomuch that the poor Creature died some time after, the place thus abus'd being invaded by a Gangreen.</P>
<P>Another, for not being nimble enough, had her Eye-Lids sowed to her Eye∣brows, which had like to have cost her her life, her Face being swell'd so.</P>
<P>One day I heard another young In∣dian or Chinese Woman, who was Chastised after the same manner, the blows sounding very loud, but she did nothing but groan, so low that one
<PB N="252" REF="195"/>
could scarce hear her very cry, saying, <HI>Ja Ja Me Signoe:</HI> I then demanded of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ja ja mi Senior.</NOTE> my Host's Brother, what it was, who told me, 'twas a Slave a Chasti∣sing, and that she would have three times as much if she complained, and that this was nothing to what others endured; and that there was another of them who was hanged in a Chamber by the Hands, for 2 or 3 days together, and that for a very small matter, as for letting fall some Milk as he thought; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Portugals without Compassion.</NOTE> for they would have made him believe he drank it: And having asked him if they ever let him down to give him any thing to Eat, he told me, no, but some times, as a great favour, would let him a little lower, just to give him a little Rice sopt in Water, and present∣ly hoise him up again: But that this would not be all, for after that he would be well Bang'd, and that they only tar∣ried for his absence, that they might begin again this cruel Chastisement.</P>
<P>He told me also, how his Brother, who was Master of the Lodging, ha∣ving one day bought a Japan Slave, a beautiful Girl, and how in Dineing with his Wife, he happened to say in Jesting, that this Slave had exceeding White Teeth,</P>

<PB N="254" REF="196"/>
thereof, advising him to save himself with all possible speed, and he asking her if she would follow him, she made Answer that she willingly would with all her heart; so that one Night hav∣ing provided a great Number of pre∣cious stones and other Riches, with two good horses, they set out upon the high way, and made such haste that they soon arrived at <HI>Pichelin,</HI> and from thence passed to <HI>Goa</HI> where this <HI>Cavalter</HI> so or∣dered the business by Friends and Mo∣ney; that he had his Pardon for the Murder he committed upon his first Wife, excusing himself to the Justice that she had dishonoured her self.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Dialcan</HI> seeing the next Morning that neither this <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> nor his Sister came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isit him as they were wont to do, soon doubted of the business, and having understood that they were fled, sent a great Num∣ber of Horsemen after, to catch them, but all in vain, for they were already out of his reach: This mightily vexed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dialcan <HI>an Enemy to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Portu▪</NOTE> the Prince, and caused him to be a great∣er Enemy to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> than ever he formerly was: For they have no greater Adversary than he, who hath several times befieged them at <HI>Goa,</HI> but

of <HI>Achin</HI> in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and I have often∣times heard him relate this exploit, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Siege of</HI> Achin▪</NOTE> when I returned from the <HI>Indies</HI> with him, telling me amongst other things how in this siege, there came such multitudes of <HI>Sumatrans</HI> upon him, that not being able to resist with so few Men, as he had, he was forced to raise the siege; but after such a man∣ner that he first embarked all his Ca∣non, and then the most part of his Men, by little and little, not making any shew of retiring, but leaving some of them all the while to skirmish; him∣self encouraging them to stand briskly to it, and to retire themselves gradual∣ly and orderly towards the Sea: Inso∣much that he ordered the business thus, that he carried of and embarked all his Men, as well Dead, as wounded and sound, and was himself the last Man that embarked; thus dexterously de∣ceiving the Enemies, who questioned not but to have had them all that same day in their Power.</P>
<P>He told me also of the memorable siege of <HI>Malaca,</HI> which he had defend∣ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clege of</HI> Malaca.</NOTE> being then Captain against the whole <HI>Holland-fleet,</HI> and about 14 thou∣sand Gentiles, there being ten or twelve
<PB N="256" REF="198"/>
Kings of those Countries, at that time <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Naval sight twice the</HI> Portu∣gals <HI>and</HI> Hollan¦ders</NOTE> assembled there with them, and how the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had Landed a great Number of huge pieces of Ca∣non for Battery, wherewith they fired without intermission: In short▪ he was besieged both by Sea and Land, without any hopes of Succour, not having 50 white Men with him in this fortress, where he was forced to watch Day and Night, which had caused him to have a dangerous Di∣stemper, of Melancholly an Oppilati∣on of the Yellow Jaundies for some space, and yet every where giving such good orders, he had remained Vanquisher of all his Enemies, until such time as to Succour him, came the <HI>Vice-Roy, Dom Martin-Alfonce,</HI> who hearing thereof, at the siege of <HI>Achin,</HI> where he was, immediately hastened thither with all his Fleet; of which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being soon advertised, pre∣sently reimbarked their Canon, and the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings were retired each one in∣to his own Country: But in the mean time the Army of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> being come to encounter that of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and thundering their Canons at one ano∣ther, setting fire to each others Ships,

burning some and sinking others. But in the end after a long fight and great loss on either side, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> saving himself from the conflict, had fled to <HI>Malaca,</HI> where he died of sick∣ness and grief<HI>:</HI> Thus much this Vali∣ant Captain <HI>Andre-Furtado</HI> related to me a little before his Death at our re∣turn; being then at the hight of St. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lens,</HI> for I took care of him in his Sickness, and being retired into his Chamber, discoursed with his Gentle∣men and Soldiers of all his Wars, Ad∣ventures and Conquests in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and <HI>I</HI> certainly believe that had such a Man continued <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> a little longer there, he would have amplified the Christian Faith amongst these Infidels.</P>
<P>It was told me amongst other things, that in this Naval Fight of <HI>Malaca,</HI> there was a Portugal, Captain of a Ga∣lion, named <HI>Louis de Sosa,</HI> who escaped from the Fight, and flying away with the first, left his Ship, and sav'd himself in the Boat on Land<HI>:</HI> Then he made such hast that he arrived in the night time at <HI>Goa,</HI> without making him∣self known; and entering his House, his Wife being in Bed, whether he suspected she played false, or for some other cause,
<PB N="257" REF="199"/>
he ran his Sword quite through her Bo∣dy, she casting her self at his Feet, de∣siring him to have a care what he did, but this softned not his cruel Courage, for all that he left not off his purpose, shewing himself more cruel to his Wife than the Hollanders his Enemies; after having left her Dead upon the place, he fled to the Main-Land, and tarried till all was quiet, and then returned to <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>Since, as I returned from <HI>Reys Magos,</HI> with one of his Servants, who had put the Irons about my Neck at <HI>Mosam∣bique,</HI> being then <HI>Merigne,</HI> or Serjeant of the Ship, but afterwards at <HI>Goa,</HI> had put himself into the Service of this <HI>Louis de Sosa,</HI> arriving both together very late at <HI>Goa,</HI> I went to Sup at the House of the said <HI>Sosa,</HI> who made me very wel∣come, upon the acquaintance he had with this Servant; and desired me al∣so to visit a Nephew of his, who had a Wound with a Pike in the Groin, when he went to see the Women; 'Twas then I learnt the History of this <HI>Louis de Sosa</HI> of my Host, who told me se∣veral other things, too tedious to relate.</P>
<P>But since I am upon the Discourse of the cruel and strange Deportments of the Portuguese at <HI>Goa,</HI> and of the rest of
<PB REF="200"/>
the <HI>Indies,</HI> I will relate some Histories that happened in or before my time.</P>
<P>A Portugal Soldier falling in Love <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tragi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l History of a</HI> Portugal <HI>Soldier.</HI></NOTE> with a young Woman at <HI>Cochin,</HI> Daugh∣ter to a Portugal Married there; he so bestirred himself that he accosted a Maid Slave of the House, telling her, he was of a very good Family, and mightily Enamoured with her Mistress, and en∣treated her to acquaint her of his good VVill and if it was possible, so to order the business that he might speak with her▪ The Slave gained by VVords, but more especially by Presents, which is the best means in those Countries to have what you please with the VVomen, gave her Mistress to understand that a Gallant young Portugal Gentleman was mightily Enamoured of her, and ready to Die for Love▪ The young VVoman allured with this discourse, was mighty curious to know who he was, and how he came to see her; for in that Coun∣try the Maids and VVomen of Quality are seldom seen, for they go about the City in <HI>Palanquins:</HI> At last, she so or∣dered the Business, that her Mistress promised to speak with him at a cer∣tain hour in the night, which being come, the young Portugal having dis∣coursed
<PB N="258" REF="200"/>
with her of his amorous Passion, she was no less enflamed than he, being of an Age fitting to pass her time, and in a Country so hot, that where any Man can only have the means to speak with a Woman or Maid, he is sure to obtain of them what he desires, if the least occasion present it self: In short, they both resolved to fly away together in some clear night, with the Woman Slave, which they after perform'd, and the young Woman taking her Rings, Jewels, and store of Silver, they Em∣barked for <HI>Goa,</HI> where being come, and having taken a Lodging somewhat pri∣vate, they there for some time led a ve∣ry pleasant Life: But the Soldier, who was mightily addicted to Gaming, soon found an end of what his Mistress brought with her, and beginning to be a weary of her, he conspired the Death of these two Women, seeing they had no longer wherewithal to keep him in his Rioting; and having sent the Slave into the City, he Strangled the Mistress, and hid her; and the Slave returning, he did the same to her, and Buried them in a private place in the Lodging. These Murders continued a long time without being known, until the same Wretch
<PB REF="201"/>
was taken for another Crime, and Con∣demned to be Hanged, as he was upon the Ladder, he confessed this lamenta∣ble and cruel Tragedy, which mightily astonished all the People, and heaped an eternal Regret upon the Disconsolate Father, who had made search in every place for his dearly Beloved Daughter▪</P>
<P>I saw another at <HI>Goa,</HI> who often came to the Lodging where I was, who sus∣pecting that his Wife had played a false trick with a Mate of a Ship, so watched his opportunity, basely disguising him∣self, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Tragical Act.</NOTE> that he caught the other near the Church of <HI>Misericordia,</HI> and Stab'd him with a Kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the Groin, when he was not at all thinking of him; tho' he had notice enough of the other's intention; and for this cause wore a Coat of Mail, with two Pistols▪ but that stood him in no stead: For the Indian was more nimble in Stabing, than he to avoid it; and from thence went straight home to his House, to do as much to his Wife also, who was soon advertised of the Death of her Friend, and seeing no way to save her self, her Husband being al∣ready come to the Door, out of Dispair, she cast her self out of the Window, where he receiving her upon the point
<PB N="259" REF="201"/>
of his Sword, left her stark-dead on the place, then he retired into the Main-Land, until they had need of Soldiers at <HI>Goa;</HI> for there are Edicts and Proclamations of Pardon made for all those who are accused of any Crime whatsoever, so that they may return se∣curely to their Houses: Such is the Ju∣stice of those Countries, where they kill one another for every small trifle.</P>
<P>If they have a Quarrel with any one of low Condition, and but little Credit, they take not the trouble to be Reven∣ged upon them themselves, but send their Slaves to Slash or Cudgel with a Bamboo, those who have not saluted them very low, or unawares have not taken of his Hat before them: They are Covetous of such Vanities, with which they feed themselves very much.</P>
<P>To this I will add that of the Daugh∣ter of the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> who having a White Elephant, a thing very rare in the <HI>Indies,</HI> the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> his Neigh∣bour, made cruel War upon him to have him, and had him in the end, o∣vercoming <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Adventure of the Daughter of the King of</HI> Siam.</NOTE> this King of <HI>Siam,</HI> whose Daughter was taken in the War, and carried Captive to <HI>Goa,</HI> where I have often seen her, she being then not very

young, and came to see my Hostess, who was a Chinese, for they were great Friends, and commonly Eat with us, comforting her self at the recital of her Miseries, and how she had been sold to a great Portugal Lord by one of those of <HI>Pegu,</HI> who had first taken away from her all her Jewels and precious Stones, she not being then above 8 or 9 years of Age; altho' great search had been every where made for her, but that the Soldier not having a mind to dis∣cover her, for fear of being constrained to restore all these Riches, had come to sell her to the Portugals, her Father's great Enemies, who also uses them no better when he can catch them: For some of them he causes to be put stark∣naked <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cruelties of the King of</HI> Siam.</NOTE> in Frying-Pans of Copper, upon the Fire and thus to be roasted by little and little: Others he causes to be put betwixt two great Fires and set down, and thus to Die in Torments; others, he exposes in the Park of his Elephants to be crushed and knocked down by by them, and a thousand sorts of bar∣barous Cruelties, which he exercises upon these poor Portugals.</P>
<P>This King of <HI>Siam</HI> once having a mind to make War upon another King
<PB N="260" REF="202"/>
his Enemy, was resolved to send for some of the greatest Lords of his King∣dom to be Commanders of his Army; But some making shew as if they were▪ Sick, by the Counsel of their Wives, who could not endure them out of their sight, of which the King being adver∣tised, sent for these Women, and having caused their Privy Parts to be cut▪off, and to be fastned upon their Husbands <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trange Cruelties.</NOTE> Foreheads, he caused them thus to walk about all the City, and then to have their Heads choped of.</P>
<P>This same King hearing that, his Concubines exercised amongst them the Sin against Nature, with Counterfeit Members, he commanded them to come before him, and having caused every one to have a Viril-Member to be painted upon their Thigh, forced them thus to go about the Streets, and than commanded them all to be burnt: Thus you may see what cruel Punish∣ments these Gentile Kings exercise without Pity upon those whom they have a mind to be Revenged on.</P>
<P>It was a Chinese, named <HI>Joan-Pay,</HI> Secretary to Don <HI>Andre Furtado,</HI> who related to me all these Histories, to which I will add what was told me in those
<PB REF="203"/>
Countries of the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu,</HI> next to that of <HI>Siam,</HI> where had happened some years since the most strange and prodigious thing in the world: Some Sorcerers and Witches so, ordered the matter with the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> that he took such a hatred against his Subjects, that he was resolved utterly to root out and extirpate them; to bring this to pass, he expresly commanded that none on pain of Death should either Plough or Sow the Land for the space of 2 or 3 years. The Ground having thus con∣tinued Incultivated for some years, without Reaping any thing, there fell out such scarcity and necessity amongst these poor People of <HI>Pegu,</HI> that having consumed all their Victuals, and all <NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrible Famine.</NOTE> other things fit to be eaten, they were forced after the manner of the <HI>Anthro∣pophages,</HI> to Eat one another. And what was most prodigious and terrible, and never before heard of, to keep publick Shambles of the Flesh of those they could catch about the Fields, the stron∣gest Killing and Massacring their Com∣panions to have a share of them; inso∣much that they went to hunt after Men as some Savage Beasts, and made Par∣ties and Assemblies for this end. Du∣ring
<PB N="261" REF="203"/>
this horrible Famine, the People of the Kingdoms round about being ad∣vertised of this extream necessity, equip∣ped a quantity of Vessels laden with Rice, and other Victuals, which they brought to <HI>Pegu,</HI> and sold it there for what they pleased: Amongst the rest, there was a Merchant of <HI>Goa,</HI> who arriving there with a Boat laden with Rice, as he went <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sad History of a</HI> Pegu∣an <HI>Damsel.</HI></NOTE> from House to House to put off his Mer∣chandize, taking for payment, Money, Slaves, or other things they could give him: He happened upon a House where they had not wherewithall to Buy so much as a Measure of Rice, and yet ready to Die with Rage and Hunger, but they shewed this Merchant an ex∣ceeding Beautiful Woman, whom her Brethren and Sisters had a mind to sell for a Slave for certain Measures of Rice; the Merchant offered 2 Measures, or Bushels, and they would have 3, Re∣monstrating, that if they killed this Girl, the Flesh would last them and nourish them much longer than his Rice; At last, when they could not a∣gree, the Merchant went his way, but no sooner was he gone, than they killed this young Woman, and cut her to pie∣ces: But the Merchant being not a lit∣tle
<PB REF="204"/>
enamoured with this Maid, and be∣sides having Compassion of her, mighti∣ly desired to save her life, soon returned again to give them for her what they demanded: But he was mightily asto∣nished and sorry when they shewed him the young Woman in pieces, tell∣ing him that not thinking he would re∣turn, they did it to satisfie Hunger<HI>:</HI> Such was the end of this <HI>Peguan</HI> Dam∣sel, and many others had the same Fate. This Merchant-related this Tragedy to one of my Friends, who passed from <HI>Portugal</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> in the Galion of <HI>Good-Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Now to return to those of <HI>Siam,</HI> the cause why the King of <HI>Siam</HI> so barba∣rously uses the Portugals, is, that they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lties of the</HI> Por∣tugals▪</NOTE> use the same Treatment towards his Captive Subjects. I have seen one of them at <HI>Goa,</HI> above 90 years of Age, a Joyner by Trade, and Slave to a Por∣tugal Gentleman, to whom this poor Man was forced to render every day to the value of two <HI>Tangues,</HI> whether he wrought or no; and went thus to seek work about the City, with his Tools: My Host having one day called him to make something for him, he told me all the Cruelties which was used against
<PB N="262" REF="204"/>
him: For when he failed to pay his two <HI>Tangues,</HI> his Master tied him like a Beast to a Stair-Case, and gave him so many Blows with a Stick, that he left him bruised and maimed; and told me that he had been a Slave for above 40 years, and had gained his Master good Money; and yet he gave him to live up∣on but a measure of Rice raw every day, without any other thing, as they do to all the other Indians, and some∣times two <HI>Baseruques,</HI> (which are some two <HI>Deniers)</HI> to have some <HI>Caril</HI> to put <NOTE PLACE="marg">Miseries of the Slaves.</NOTE> amongst the Rice.</P>
<P>Thus you may see, how these Slaves live, witho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> either Bread or any other Meat but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> boiled in Water; inso∣much that several die with Hunger and Work: They lie upon the Ground, on little <HI>Esteres,</HI> or Matts, made of Bull∣rushes, or the Bark of Trees.</P>
<P>The Portugals acquire much Repu∣tation of making good Christians; for having caused them to be Baptized, they thus make them Die miserably: Also the <HI>Japans</HI> knowing their Letchery and insatiable Avarice, seem to have had some reason for their rising against them: For these, who are a subtile and wary Peo∣ple, seeing that the design of the Portu∣gals,
<PB REF="205"/>
after having made them Christi∣ans, was to dispossess them of their Lands and Goods by all Inventions; therefore they did not care for their A∣mity, much less did they desire 'em to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dominati∣on of the</HI> Portugals <HI>what?</HI></NOTE> Govern, and this perhaps was one of the causes that they have Martyred so many Jesuits who were utterly inno∣cent of all this<HI>:</HI> For these <HI>Japans</HI> are mightily Jealous of their Wives, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Japans <HI>jealous.</HI></NOTE> Portugals had no other aim but to gain them, especially those of the greatest, with whom afterwards they do what they please; which was the reason that moved these People to so much Cruelty.</P>
<P>I have found out in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that the Whoredoms, Ambition, Avarice, and Greediness of the Portugals, has been one of the chiefest causes why the <HI>Indians</HI> become not Christians so easily: This is the Reason why the People of the Portugal Churches, who are in those parts, mightily desire some French, Dutch, or Scots to be with them, be∣cause these People lead a life less impure and scandalous; which is the thing that most chiefly maintains and upholds Religion in that part of the World. I <NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion how and by what maintained</NOTE> have there known a Father Jesuit of the Country of <HI>Artois,</HI> who lived in <HI>Sal∣sete,</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="205"/>
which is a little <HI>Isle</HI> not far from the main Land, depending upon <HI>Goa;</HI> he was there as Curate in a great Par∣rish, and understood very well the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue: But afterward the Je∣suites took him from thence to send him to <HI>Chaoul;</HI> and I then saw the poor People of his Parish, who mightily la∣mented that they had lost him, some saying that they had rather have had their Arms cut off, than have seen him taken away from them: For they fear∣ed to have some <HI>Portugal,</HI> who would Tyranize over them.</P>
<P>Thus ye may see what honest Men can do amongst the very Infidels, who know how to discern the good from the bad.</P>
<P>As for the Father Jesuits, they pass as far as <HI>China</HI> to make there some fruit, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jesuits in</HI> China.</NOTE> and fit their beards and hair after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner, and have their Cloaths made after the same fashion, and Learn the Language to Accommodate them∣selves the more easily thereto; but they dare not Preach the Gospel there but in private, for fear of being put to Death<HI>:</HI> I have been told at <HI>Goa</HI> that they have Converted great Numbers of them, yea, the very <HI>Mandarins</HI> them∣selves,
<PB REF="206"/>
and Governors of Provinces: They have a Church, and Colledge at <HI>Macao,</HI> an <HI>Isle</HI> and City of <HI>China,</HI> and there they Learn the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language:</P>
<P>This is about 45 Leagues from <HI>Can∣ton</HI> one of the greatest Cities in all <HI>Chi∣na,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Canton <HI>a great City.</HI></NOTE> where they go through a great River, much bigger than the <HI>Sene</HI> at <HI>Roar,</HI> and is joyned with the Sea.</P>
<P>At the Port of <HI>Canton</HI> are continual∣ly above three or four thousand very large Boats; and there a great Num∣ber of Birds of the River retire them∣selves <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</NOTE> which they leave in the Morn∣ing to go into the fields to seek their Living, some on one side, and some on the other; then when the Night comes, the <HI>Chinese</HI> sound a little horn, which is heard at a great distance, and then these <HI>Ducks</HI> return every one to his Boat, where they have their Nests, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ducks of</HI> China.</NOTE> hatch their young ones.</P>
<P>A Man who shall have a Boat gar∣nished with these Ducks is rich; For they sell 'em raw in the Market, and some they also Rost to sell.</P>
<P>A <HI>Portugal</HI> told me at <HI>Goa,</HI> that go∣ing from <HI>Macao</HI> to <HI>Canton,</HI> he had been Cozened by a <HI>Chinese</HI> after this man∣ner; for having bought one of these
<PB N="264" REF="206"/>
Rosted Ducks at a Cooks shop, seeing it look well, and appearing to be very fat, he carried it with him on board his Vessel, to eat it, but when he had put his knife within it to cut it up, he found nothing but the skin which was upon some paper, ingeniously fitted up with little sticks, which made up the Body of the Duck; the <HI>Chinese</HI> having very <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Guile and deceits of</HI> Chines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> dexterously plucked away the flesh, and then so well Accommodated this skin, that it seemed to be a true Duck; of which the <HI>Portugal</HI> was so ashamed that he durst not say a word thereof to any one for fear of being Laughed at, both by the <HI>Chinese,</HI> and his Com∣panions; and so eat the skin alone of the Duck without making any fur∣ther ado.</P>
<P>These People of <HI>China</HI> are very sub∣till, and great cheats, patient in Labour, they wake all the Night long: And when two or three are upon one piece of work, some go to sleep whilst the o∣thers work, they come to relieve one a∣nother <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chinise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>cuning Merchants and desirous of Money.</HI></NOTE> by turns. If they see any Mer∣chant that has Money to lay out, they do all they can to have his traffick▪ fetch∣ing all sorts of Merchandise, if those do not please they go for others, untill
<PB REF="207"/>
they have catched his Money.</P>
<P>There the custom is for all People of the same Office or Trade, to live toge∣ther in the same street, as all the Paint∣ers in one street, all the Shoe-Makers in an other; and so also the rest of the Tradesmen, the persons of honour are in one street, the less Noble in an other, and never mix together, thinking that a great shame and disgrace: They also bring up their Children in their own calling and no other, and observe this very strictly: When they have a mind to marry their Children, they cause them to come all to a certain place de∣signed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arriages</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> China.</NOTE> for that purpose, which is a great Hall, and there put all the Males on one side, and the Maids on the other directly over against one another: The young women have their faces covered with a Vail, and the Boys go to choose which pleases them best, and keep to those whom they have taken by the hand; this is the manner of their Mar∣riages: The <HI>Portugals</HI> are mighty de∣sirous to have these <HI>Chineses</HI> for Slaves, because they are not only faithful and industrious, but also very active in business.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Portugals</HI> come to <HI>Canton</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="207"/>
there are <HI>Chineses</HI> on purpose, who make it their Trade to go into the Country towards the Habitations, and Villages<HI>:</HI> And when they see there some pretty little Boy or Girl, they entice them away with little toys, promising them more; then when they see them at a little di∣stance, they carry them away by force, and hide them in certain places wait∣ing till Night comes, and then come to the Sea side, where they know there are Traffickers, to whom they sell them for 12 and 15 Tays a piece, which is about 25 Crowns.</P>
<P>My Hostess at <HI>Goa</HI> told me that she <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chineses, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tole away.</HI></NOTE> had been thus deceived by a <HI>Chinese,</HI> at 8 years of Age: A young <HI>Chinese</HI> Slave gave me an account returning from the <HI>Indies,</HI> how he had been also thus trappan'd by a little Cake, which had been given him, made of a sort of paste fried, of which they make very much use.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> are a great Number of Hogs like wild Boars, of whom they make Gammons to sell to those who belong to the Sea, and especially to the <HI>Portugals</HI> who come there; and have also the same cunning tricks with the Rosted Ducks, to pluck away the flesh, leaving nothing but the skin, which
<PB REF="208"/>
they fill with black Earth, with the bones therein, then rub it so well with the fat that it seems to be the flesh it self: They sell this by weight, and 'tis no easy matter to discern the right from the wrong: Nay, if you put your knife in it, if it be but as they cut it in slices: you may perceive the deceit▪</P>

that cause he must be content to be put to Death, and have his Ship Consiseat∣ed: The other thought this very strange, and began to entreat the <HI>Mandarin</HI> as well as he could with fair words and promises to let him go▪ but the <HI>Manda∣rin</HI> not having a mind to quit him at so easy a rate, commanded him to be strip∣ped stark naked; and to lie along upon the ground as the <HI>Portugals</HI> do to their Slaves, and others, then caused him to have three blows with a Cane sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in two, and then was let go.</P>
<P>Now when there arrives any Ships in the Ports of <HI>China,</HI> to put off their Mer∣chandise, the <HI>Chineses</HI> coming for the cu∣stom, take the length and the breadth of the Ship, then after that they know with∣in a very small matter what the Ship car∣ries, they pay accordingly without regarding what the Merchandize is.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Chineses</HI> at their meat, they eat like Gluttons, and with an ill grace, as I have often taken notice of, in eating and drinking with them. They have this cu∣stom, never to touch the meat they eat, but have two little spatules of hard wood very neatly made like forks, which they hold betwixt their fingers, they eat the flesh of Dogs, which is a great dish a∣mongst them, they are also mightily used
<PB N="267" REF="209"/>
to Rice, and little Bread. As for their Houses, they are very sumptuous, and adorned with all sort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of pretty Devices: They also are very Voluptuous, as well Men as Women.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Goa,</HI> I think it not much amiss to relate what a Portugal Gentleman told me of their Adventures, which was that once going to War towards the South Sea, with the Naval Army of Ga∣liots, (which every year go out against the <HI>Malabars)</HI> about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> when their Winter is past, and at the same time another Army goes out to the North Sea, which is towards the Red Sea.</P>
<P>The Captains of the Army held Coun∣cil together to go into a Habitation of the Gentiles, along by the Coast near to <HI>Co∣chin,</HI> to take away by force a Golden Pagod, very great, with other little ones, who were in a certain Temple there: But forasmuch as these Gentiles were Confe∣derates with the Portugals, they would not do this enterprise in the day-time, but went one night to go ashore in this little City, not far from the Sea, where the Pagod was, and setting foot on Land, they set Fire in every place to fright these poor People, and so went straight to the Pagod, but the Fire passed so quickly, that before they had Power to take the Idol it forced
<PB REF="210"/>
them to retire a little faster than they came, and had no more time than only to snatch the Pendants and Rings from the Ears and Fingers of these poor Reli∣gious Women, who were shut up, Dan∣cing all the night in their Pagod, according to their Custom: They were near 500, and seeing the Enemy entering, they all assembled themselves together, fastening their Legs and Arms one within another, that 'twas impossible for the Portugals to draw so much as one of them out: But seeing the Fire at their Heels, they only snatched away the Jewels from their Ears, their Fingers they cruelly cut off to have the Rings, and they made such a lamen∣table noise, that 'twas a great pity to hear them: The Portugals flying away from the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, left all these Religious young Women to be Burnt, none being able to succour them; and thus cruelly do the Portugals treat their best Friends and Confederates: He who related to me this pitious History, was named Don <HI>Louts Lobe,</HI> who was of this enterprise, and told me, that this uproar moved him from his very Heart to Pity.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the City of <HI>Goa,</HI> and the Country round about, I pretend not here to make an exact and ample Discription; yet I desire the Reader to
<PB N="268" REF="210"/>
take notice, that that little which I speak is no more than what my Memory was able to furnish me withall; for being up∣on the places, I was so carefully watched, as are all Strangers, and especially the French, that I could put nothing in Wri∣ting; And this was the principal cause of my Imprisonment at <HI>Mosambique,</HI> being accused of having made a Ruttier of the Sea, which thing the Portugals fear the most, not being willing, that the French, English, or Hollanders, should know any thing of those Countries.</P>
<P>I will say of <HI>Goa</HI> in a few words, that it is a City excellent well scituated in an Island, environed with the River, some part level, and other mountainous, and may be about as big as <HI>Tours,</HI> but Peopled with all Nations of <HI>India:</HI> It is very well built, in its Churches, Hospitals, Colleges, publick Palaces, and particular Houses of the Portugals and Natives, which are of a reddish Bastard Marble, and Free-Stone: The other Houses of the Indians are like Cabins built with Earth, and some Stone: They have a great number of Gardens, with <HI>Tanques,</HI> or great Ponds to Bath in, and many Fruit▪ Trees<HI>:</HI> The Country is good and fertile, bearing Rice twice a year: The Gentiles have liberty of their Religion, but are not suffered to have any
<PB REF="211"/>
Pagod or Temple within the City, but on∣ly in the main-land, and out of the Isle.</P>
<P>When these Gentiles and Idolaters come to Die, if they leave little Children, the Jesuits are careful to take and bring them up, and instruct them in the Faith; and therefore for their Pains, they seize upon their Lands, Inheritances, and Goods▪ My Host, a Christian Indian, told me, that he had been served after this manner, without being a jot the better instructed.</P>
<P>As for the Men of War, they are about 1500 or 2000, according as the Fleets arrive. I saw a General-Muster of all the Inhabitants bearing Arms, as well the Portugals as Natives and Indians, and were sound to be about 4000: They did that, being that time in fear of the Hol∣landers, who scowered the Sea with a great number of Vessels. I neither knew nor met with any Frenchman there, but a good Father Jesuit, named <HI>Estienne de la Croix,</HI> Native of <HI>Roan,</HI> of whom I re∣ceived no small kindness: I also saw 3 others, who had escaped from the <HI>Mal∣dives,</HI> amongst whom was one named <HI>Francois Pirard,</HI> a Briton, who has Writ the History of his Voyages: I was told that 3 Months before I arrived at <HI>Goa,</HI> there went away from thence, a French Gentleman named <HI>de Feynes,</HI> ho caused
<PB N="269" REF="211"/>
himself to be called the Count of <HI>Monsert:</HI> He was mighty skillful in the Art of Blowing up places; which was the cause of his Misfortune; for coming from <HI>Per∣sia</HI> to <HI>Ormus,</HI> as he was discoursing there▪ that he knew the way of Blowing up a Fortress, was it never so strong, he was presently laid hold of as a Prisoner, and carried to <HI>Goa,</HI> where he was kept in Pri∣son for fear he would observe the For∣tresses; and the first Fleet that returned to <HI>Portugal,</HI> he was sent therein, and kept Prisoner at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> until Monsieur▪ <HI>du Mayne</HI> went into <HI>Spain,</HI> who obtain'd his Deli∣verance.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the Fertility of the Land of <HI>Goa,</HI> and what it produces, I remit you to what has been written by the Portugals; only I say, that the Fruit most necessary for the life of Man, is that of the Palm. This Tree is Spongy, ha∣ving little Strings or Veins environed with a Pellicule, and draws its substance from the Sandy-Earth, from which it also draws great abundance of moisture, which is ne∣cessary for the greatness of the Fruit it bears, and the quantity of <HI>Esura</HI> or Wine which this Fruit renders. Of the Nut of this Palm-Tree, so celebrated in the <HI>Indies,</HI> they draw abundance of Meat and Drink.</P>
<P>There a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> plenty of these Coco's, or
<PB REF="212"/>
Maldives; but amongst others, they re∣mark one sort thereof which comes from the bottom of the Sea, the Fruit is bigger than the common Palm; 'tis also very dear amongst the Portugals, who sup∣pose it to have a great Virtue for the Dis∣ease of the Lungs, and for the <HI>Astmatiques,</HI> or Shortness of Breath, and against Poi∣son. The Nut thereof is very great, long and black, in form of a Gondale; The Tree that bears this Fruit is not to be seen, growing at the bottom of the Sea: but when the Sea is agitated, the Fruit is born from the bottom to the top, and is found upon the Shore.</P>
<P>I come now to my return, when the Senior <HI>Andre Furtado de Mondoso</HI> return∣ing to <HI>Portugal,</HI> sent for me to go with him. We parted then from the Bar of <HI>Goa</HI> the 2d of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1610. Being Embark'd in a Ship called <HI>Nostra Segniora di Beigna di Francia,</HI> which was very heavily laden and cumbered, inso∣much that 'twas no small confusion to be there; <HI>Andre Furtado</HI> was very sick when he Embark'd. At last we set sail with a great deal of trouble, because the Ship had Cinnamon almost as far as the mid∣dle of the Mast, every day taking care to put by so much out of the way.</P>
<P>The 16th of <HI>January</HI> we saw the De∣sarts
<PB N="270" REF="212"/>
of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and sailed with a very good Wind as far as the Land of <HI>Crimbe,</HI> or Country of the <HI>Abassins,</HI> and passed a∣long by the Coast the 9th of <HI>Feb.</HI> But the 11th we feared to be lost by a contrary Wind, the Ship beating upon the Sea, and drawing in much Water. The Senior <HI>Andre Furtado</HI> sick as he was, seeing this extremity, got upon the Deck to order the Ship to be lightned and pumped, and about 300 Black Slaves, with some Ma∣riners, were 3 days and nights, and had much ado to empty it.</P>
<P>The 15th of <HI>Feb.</HI> we saw the Isle of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> mightily covered with Fog, and bearing about to pass the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> with a favourable Gale of Wind, we passed it the 16th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>Being at the height of the Isle of <HI>St. Helens,</HI> we were in great doubt whether we should go on Shore to take there some fresh Water, and the Passengers and Ma∣riners disputed stifly against the Master and Pilot, but they put it all to the Sieur <HI>Andre Furtado,</HI> who was then mortally Sick, and who said that he had no Or∣ders from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to go to the said Isle, except it was in case of great necessity, and that he feared to find there some Enemies, who might give them trouble, it being the place where they
<PB REF="213"/>
commonly came: Thereupon he com∣manded a review to be taken of the fresh Water that remained, to know if it would hold out for every one to have half a Pint a day for 4 Months, for we reckoned we had so long to sail<HI>:</HI> This enquiry exactly made, 'twas found within a very small matter of this measure; so that we made the best of our way, the Wind being fa∣vourable. We could not persuade Senior <HI>Andre Furtado,</HI> tho he was sick, to repo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e himself in this little Isle of St. <HI>Helen;</HI> so that in the end this poor Gentleman, be∣ing weakened and overcome with sick∣ness, died the first of <HI>April:</HI> His Body was Embalmed that it might be carried to <HI>Portugal,</HI> for in the Ships there is never want of <HI>Camfre, Benjoin,</HI> and Aromatical Things for that purpose<HI>:</HI> There was a Portugal Barber, who knew only how to Shave and let Blood; and having a mind to make Balm, in causing the <HI>Ben∣join</HI> to be melted, and to fill the Body therewith: I releived him from this trou∣ble and apparent Error, and made him ac∣knowledge his Fault; and so having Em∣balmed the Body, and put it in a Coffin, It was laid up in the Guard-Robe of the Chamber, with a lighted Lamp by it, and we carried it without any smell or incon∣veniency as far as <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="213"/>
We passed close by the <HI>Isles</HI> of the <HI>A∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ores</HI> and along by them, were great de∣bates betwixt those of the Ship, some were resolved to go on shore by force, which the Captain, the Master and Pilot would by no means yeild too: This came all from the passenger Souldiers, who came to dispatch their business in <HI>Portu∣gal</HI> for Recompence of their Services in the <HI>Indies:</HI> For then the King gives them some Captain-ships of Fortresses in the <HI>Indies:</HI> But the Captain caused some of the most Mutinous to come before him; (for they were ready to lay hold upon their Arms, and made no small stir and ado, thinking themselves still in the <HI>Indies)</HI> but he soon made them to know their duty; and persuing our course with a ve∣ry good wind, we arrived at <HI>Cuscais▪</HI> the 2d of <HI>July,</HI> and the next day I went on shore, leaving all my things on Board, which were there above a Month with∣out being able to get them out; there be∣ing Guards which stole them all away. At the Months end the Kings Duty be∣ing paid, the small things were brought on Shore, and there was several who found their Chests fast shut, but nothing within them: I was one of those also; but it was small loss to me, not having brought back any thing of value from
<PB REF="214"/>
those Countries, where I had nothing but bad fortune; and was very well content that I was safely returned tho I was not a little indisposed in my person, because of these salt and spiced waters, which I had then been forc'd to drink till they so heated my Stomack, that my mouth cast out burning Vapours, and I could scaree quench my thirst.</P>
<P>At length being restored to my health by cooling remedies, and seeing my self strong enough to reassume the way to my dear native Country, where I had a great desire to see my self again after so many satigues and dangers, I embarked the 17th of <HI>August</HI> in a Ship belonging to one <HI>Pi∣care Simon</HI> of <HI>Rochelle.</HI> and in our Com∣pany was another Ship called also the <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>Rochelle:</HI> But being in the Sea, we were so beaten with Storms, that the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> mightily desired us to keep by them; but one Night in a very great Storm, her Sails split and tore to pieces, they were forced to bend their main Top Sail in stead of their main Sail, insomuch that in the Morning we saw her at above 3 Leagues of us, and had put abroad their Ensign to cause us to come up to her; which we did as soon as might be, and coming near her, we saw them crying out for <HI>Misericorde,</HI> or mercy, for they
<PB N="272" REF="214"/>
were sinking: We boarded them at the <HI>Poop,</HI> and they saved themselves, who could in our Ship; it was a great pity to see them in this extremity: I saved one of them along by the side, who fell from the Stern of our Ship: Thus was the Ship lost and all the Merchandise that was in her; and afterward we arrived at <HI>Rochel∣le</HI> the 3d of <HI>Sept.</HI> from thence I came to <HI>Paris</HI> the 23 of the same Month, when our young King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. (whom God preserve and prosper) was gone to be. Crowned at <HI>Rheims.</HI></P>
<P>I had heard no News of the unhappy accident happened in the Person of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, my good Master, untill we were in sight of <HI>Lisbon;</HI> for then, ac∣cording to the custom, there came a <HI>Ca∣ravel</HI> from the Port to see and know who we were, who told us that sad History, which I could scarcely believe, but com∣ing to Land it was too much confirmed, to my Eternal regret and sorrow.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK V.</HEAD>
<P>HAving return'd to <HI>Paris</HI> from so many long and troublesome Voyages after the Death of King <HI>Henry the Great,</HI> whom I can never sufficiently lament, and all other good French Men, I had a desire to make a Religious Voyage into the <HI>Ho∣ly Land,</HI> there to go pay (like a good Christian) so many Vows I had made to God for the innumerable Perils and Dangers, from which it hath pleased him, mercifully to preserve me so of∣ten.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="18"/>
In this Resolution I parted from <HI>Paris</HI> the 19th. of <HI>July,</HI> 1611. and took Coach to <HI>Marseilles,</HI> where I ar∣rived <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Embark∣ment at</HI> Marseil∣les.</NOTE> the 14th. Day of <HI>August,</HI> and tarried there for some Days to wait for passage, which at last I found in a Ship of <HI>Toulon,</HI> called the <HI>St. Francis,</HI> belonging to <HI>Ode Bergue,</HI> and <HI>Vander Strate,</HI> Merchants of <HI>Toulon,</HI> and <HI>Marseilles:</HI> There embarking, the 8th. of <HI>September,</HI> we set sail, and the 12th. saw the Isle of <HI>Sardania,</HI> which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sardania.</NOTE> we left on the North-East; and the 15th. we saw the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> passing near the Isle of <HI>Guerite,</HI> which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Guerite <HI>Isle.</HI></NOTE> is a little Island not far from the main Land, where the Robbers and Pyrates lurk, as well <HI>Turks</HI> as <HI>Christians;</HI> we had this Isle towards the South-West.</P>
<P>The 17th. we passed along by <HI>Mal∣ta,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malta.</NOTE> then by <HI>Sicilia,</HI> where we found a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sicilia.</NOTE> Ship in the fashion of a Galiot, who came directly towards us to know if they durst engage us; but when they had perceived our Strength, they tacked about, taking their course to∣wards <HI>Barbary,</HI> seeking other Prey more easie to surprize.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="18"/>
The 21st. we passed along by <HI>Can∣dia,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Candia.</NOTE> where there is a little Island cal∣led <NOTE PLACE="marg">Agose <HI>Isle.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Agose,</HI> which advances into the Sea with a Point towards the South: Then the 27th. we went to the Isle of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> towards the City of <HI>Bafe,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyprus.</NOTE> not far from the Coast, and went to pass the Cape <HI>de Gate,</HI> designing to go to <HI>Famagusta:</HI> But having a sharp Gale, and good for our Voyage, we continued our course, bearing to∣wards <HI>Tripoly</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> where we ar∣riv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrival at</HI> Tripoly.</NOTE> the last Day of <HI>September;</HI> the next Morning, the 1s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. of <HI>October,</HI> I went on shore to lodge in the City, in a Campo near the <HI>Juderie,</HI> or <HI>Jews-Place:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Campo.</NOTE> These Campo's are great Hou∣ses, with large Courts and Fountains, where Strangers retire themselves for shelter, like Inns. These belong to some great Person, who letts them out; and he who is the Porter there∣of, whom they call <HI>Boabe,</HI> receives the Money of the Passengers, and gives it to the Master, of whom he holds it upon Rent.</P>
<P>Having tarried some time at <HI>Tripoly,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Voyage to Mount</HI> Le∣banon.</NOTE> I had a mind to see Mount <HI>Lebanon;</HI> and for this effect took a Turk, with
<PB N="276" REF="19"/>
an Ass to carry our Victuals: We left the City the 11th. of <HI>November,</HI> and went over very high Mountains, and troublesome to pass, and in the end arrived at the Lodging of a <HI>Chaldean</HI> Archbishop, called Father <HI>George,</HI> who received us after the best manner he could. His House is right above Mount <HI>Lebanon;</HI> his Church is under his Habitation, and a Water-mill un∣derneath his Church. I saw a good Father, a <HI>Chaldean</HI> Priest, and Kins∣man to this Archbishop, who came from grinding his Corn, as he shewed us by his Visage all white with Meal; and seeing him in this case, we knew him not to be of the Church, until the next Morning, which was <HI>Sun∣day,</HI> when I saw him go with the Host in his Hand from thence to a Village, there to sing Mass. The Father <HI>George</HI> lived there with his Mother, Sisters, and Nieces, making one and the same Family altogether. He shewed me a Chapel above his House, upon a little Rock, right under Mount <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and told methere was there a Hole, out of which every Year, upon the 1st. Day of <HI>May</HI> only, gushes an abundance of
<PB N="277" REF="19"/>
Water, at such time as they sing Mass in the Chapel. The Mountain is co∣vered all over with Cyprus-Trees. The Place is very agreeable; but the Winter is there very troublesome, be∣cause of the excessive Cold, and great Snows, which mightily afflicts these good Fathers, so that they are con∣strained for that cause to pass the Win∣ter near <HI>Tripoly,</HI> and return there a∣gain in the Spring.</P>
<P>The next Morning after we had heard Mass, we set forward towards the Place where the Cedars are, about <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cedars.</NOTE> Three Leagues from thence; where being come, we had such a cold blast of Wind, that my Turk blew his Fingers: I order'd him to get upon a Cedar-Tree to break me off some Branches, but he tarried there not long; for the Cold soon made him to descend, that he could not get me so much as I desir'd. But I feared he would tumble down, being half fro∣zen; and besides, he had not eaten his Breakfast, because of their <HI>Roma∣dan,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Romadan, <HI>or Fast.</HI></NOTE> in the which they fast till Even∣ing, not daring to eat any thing upon pain of Death, except it be in private,
<PB N="278" REF="20"/>
and those who observe not strictly their Law; and when I saw him tremble in good earnest, I presently made him come down, fearing to lose him.</P>
<P>From thence we reassumed our way to return to <HI>Canibi,</HI> which is a Place <NOTE PLACE="marg">Canibi.</NOTE> belonging to the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Patriarch, and had very bad Weather of Rain; so that we arrived there late in the E∣vening, after having passed many little Habitations, situate for the most part upon the side of inaccessible Rocks, and are almost all <HI>Chaldean,</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Christians, with some few Moors amongst them. We were there very well received, and drank excellent Wine, which grows in these Mountains.</P>
<P>The next Day having heard Mass, we returned to <HI>Tripoli,</HI> where I pas∣sed a very troublesome Winter, be∣cause <NOTE PLACE="marg">Inunda∣tions.</NOTE> of the great Inundations of Water which came from the Moun∣tains, and so swelled a little River which runs through the middle of the City, that it bore down part of the Houses, with great loss of Merchan∣dise, and Water-mills, which it car∣ried
<PB N="279" REF="20"/>
quite away, with the Stone-bridge. This was the cause that Bread was there very scarce and dear, that we had much adoe to get a little black Biscuit, half spoiled, which was sold me by weight, and at what rate they pleased, and that by halves; and the People already began to cry out for Famine. The House of the Consul of <HI>France</HI> fell upon him, and killed him: Several other Houses fell also by this disaster of Inundation, which came in a Night without so much as dreaming of.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Tripoly</HI> is situated in a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Descrip∣tion of</HI> Tripoly.</NOTE> Valley below Mount <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and has still an old Castle with square Towers, built formerly by the French, the then Lords of the <HI>Holy-Land:</HI> There is at present a Garrison of <HI>Turks.</HI> The City may be as big as <HI>Pontoise,</HI> and there is but a small River that pas∣ses that way, which is very subject to break out of its Banks when the Snows of the Mountain melt, and then does a thousand Mischiefs, as I have seen when I happened to be there: All the rest of the time one may pass almost dry upon the Stones. The City is
<PB N="280" REF="21"/>
very well built; the Houses low, ex∣cept those of the Great Ones; and there inhabits a great Number of <HI>Gre∣cian</HI> Christians, <HI>Jews,</HI> some <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Italians.</HI> Those of <HI>Marseilles</HI> trade mightily there.</P>
<P>There is also a Bassa, or Governour, who, in the Summer, goes with his Nobility to lie in Tents in the Mea∣dows betwixt the Port and the City, and there exercise themselves at the Launce, and Sword. This City is a∣bout Nine Days Journey from <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>The Spring being come, I began to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parting for</HI> Jerusa∣lem.</NOTE> think of going to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and for this purpose, parting the 9th. of <HI>A∣pril,</HI> 1612. with a <HI>Mouquary,</HI> or <HI>Turk∣ish</HI> Carrier, we took our way towards <HI>Damascus,</HI> and the first Night lay in a little Meadow by a River-side, where we endured no small cold, because of the Winds which come from these Mountains laden with Snow. The next Day we raised our little Caravan, which consisted of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> and a <HI>Greek</HI> Christian and his Sister: This young <HI>Grecian</HI> Girl was not a∣bove Twelve Years of Age, and was very vertuous and brisk, being mounted
<PB N="281" REF="21"/>
upon her little Ass, which was led by her Brother. We passed many Mountains, and arrived at a Habita∣tion of <HI>Arabians,</HI> where we had but very bad Lodging, lying along the Walls of the Houses which are in ve∣ry dirty Places: I made my Pillow of a Stone.</P>
<P>The next Day we went to Dine at <HI>Armel,</HI> a little City of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Armel.</NOTE> and then retired into a House of Plea∣sure very stately and magnificent, but there was none in it; it serves only for a retiring Place, and Lodging for the <HI>Caravans,</HI> they giving so much to the Porter who is the Keeper thereof: This House is furnish'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">After the Moorish manner.</NOTE> <HI>a la Moresque,</HI> and strong enough to hold out an As∣sault. A certain <HI>Turk</HI> who returned from the Bassa of <HI>Tripoly</HI> caused it to be built after this manner: The Bassa commanded him to be taken and brought into his presence, telling him, That being his Subject he was greater than he, in regard of the sumptuous and strong House which he had caused to be built, that he might rebel against him; and thereupon com∣manded his Head to be chopp'd off in
<PB N="282" REF="22"/>
recompence of several good and nota∣ble Services he had done him.</P>
<P>Parting from this Place, we went along by a Rivolet to lodge upon a little Hill within the enclosure of cer∣tain Walls very low, where there was a small Cottage of the <HI>Arabians:</HI> We lay along the Wall, and passed the Night with great fear of the thievish <HI>Arabs.</HI> We parted from thence be∣times in the Morning, and came to <HI>Bailbec,</HI> a very ancient City, where <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bailbec.</NOTE> formerly lived Christians, the Ruines of a Church remaining there yet. I went into the City with my <HI>Mouquary,</HI> which was the <HI>Turk,</HI> that furnished me with a Horse to ride upon, and there we sought for a little Wine, but privately, it being forbid to sell any: We found some White, very good, at the House of a <HI>Grecian,</HI> who earnest∣ly desired us to hide it. They failed not to come to search our Cloaths, and other things, but they could not find it, for we had locked it fast up. We lay without the City along the Walls which are made of great Stones, not of Masons Work, but roughly set one upon another, each one above
<PB N="283" REF="22"/>
12 or 15 Foot long. The Bassa of this Place went out about Noon with all his Cavalry and Infantry, going to some Place, not far from thence, upon a Quarrel which he had against the Bassa of <HI>Damascus.</HI> He marched in excellent good order, especially for <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> to observe.</P>
<P>We dislodged from this Place two or three Hours before Day, passing by Rocks, of which the most part were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquaeducts.</NOTE> broke and thrown down, and the Veins and Pipes bigger than ones Arm are still to be seen, through which flowed the Water before they were broke down: There is amongst others one of these Rocks slit in two, about 3 or 4 Leagues from <HI>Damascus;</HI> and the River of <HI>Jordan,</HI> which comes <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jordan.</NOTE> from Mount <HI>Lebanus,</HI> passes with great swiftness very near it, there is a Bridge over which we passed: Along by this River are places cut like Caves within the Rock, where lived formerly cer∣tain Hermits; and truly the Place is very proper for a solitary Life, being exceeding desert, and of difficult ac∣cess. We went to lie in a certain Ha∣bitation, and the next Day we arrived
<PB N="284" REF="23"/>
at <HI>Damascus,</HI> which was on <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Damascus.</NOTE> Eve, the 14th. of <HI>April.</HI> I went to take a Lodging in the House of one <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> a Rabbi of the <HI>Jews,</HI> to whom I had been recommended by a Cousin of his, which I had known at <HI>Tripoly.</HI> He received us after the best manner he could; but we supped but badly, because it was the Day of their Sabbath, in which they dare scarce touch any thing. The next Day I so ordered the Business with this <HI>Jew,</HI> my Host, that he gave me one of his Servants to conduct me, and help me to buy an Ass. They were at that time making Preparations for their Passover, and I saw them buy Sheep in a Market for that purpose, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Passover of the</HI> Jews.</NOTE> and this Servant chose the fattest for his Master; so that I had much adoe to hale him to the place where I knew there was an Ass to be sold, which had been brought from <HI>Tripoly</HI> with us: I bargained for it for 19 Pataques <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pataques.</NOTE> and a half one, for the <HI>Jew:</HI> I ex∣changed my Money, taking for <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Money, Pieces of Albouquelque, to give to the Cafars, and gained 55 for 50; for the Cafars go for as much <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cafars.</NOTE>
<PB N="285" REF="23"/>
as those of <HI>Spain.</HI> Albouquelques are pieces of <HI>German</HI> Money, having the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Albouquel∣ques.</NOTE> mark of a Lyon; the <HI>Turks</HI> take it for a Dog, and therefore call them Albou∣quelques or Dog-pieces. I desired al∣so my <HI>Jew</HI> to find me out a <HI>Turk,</HI> which he did, and promised him a Patache a Day, but he was to find himself with Victuals.</P>
<P>As for this City of <HI>Damascus,</HI> it is very fine and pleasant, having most delicate Gardens, and is seated in a Valley, as it were in the middle of a Meadow; and there is a Lake and a River which pass cross it, with many excellent Fountains: Amongst others is to be seen that of St. <HI>Paul</HI> near to a Mosque.</P>
<P>This City is divided into two, by a great Church-yard of some 400 Paces, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Damascus <HI>described.</HI></NOTE> after the Moorish manner: The whole City may be as big as <HI>Orleance.</HI> It is of great Trade; and amongst others, there is a great Street, where there is nothing but Merchandice of Drugs and Spices. This City is encompas∣sed with Walls, but not round about, and has a very strong Castle, and great number of Gardens in the adja∣cent
<PB N="286" REF="24"/>
Parts. There is a Bassa, or Go∣vernour, and a multitude of <HI>Greek</HI> Christians there, but no <HI>French.</HI> It is about Three Days Journey from the Sea, and Five from <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> For∣merly it was the greatest Commerce of the <HI>Indies, Persia, Chaldea, Arme∣nia,</HI> and other Places.</P>
<P>We left <HI>Damascus</HI> the 16th. of <HI>April,</HI> and went to <HI>Sassa,</HI> where was a Cafar, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cafars, or Toll.</NOTE> or Toll: But my <HI>Turk,</HI> to save me from paying any thing, and thinking to have the half of that which belong∣ed to the Cafar, put upon my Tur∣bant, which was of the <HI>Greek</HI> Colour, another of white after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner, and passed thus without be∣ing taken notice of by the Cafars, or else they were asleep in their Houses; for we saw none coming toward us as we passed over the Bridge which is there: So that we escaped, and went from thence through a very bad way full of great Stones, where I endured no small pain, scarce being able to draw my self out from amongst them, because of the Water and Mire which are together; and this bad way con∣tinued almost the whole Day. But as
<PB N="287" REF="24"/>
we were a good way in these Boggs and Quagmires, we saw coming to∣wards us a <HI>Turkish</HI> Cavalier, with a Harquebuse at his Saddle-bow, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Adventure of a</HI> Turk.</NOTE> passing near to me, he demanded, <HI>An ta Frangi?</HI> if I was a Christian; and having answered him, Yes, he return∣ed in a Fury towards my <HI>Turk,</HI> who was before me, and held his Sword at his Throat to kill him, had not a poor <HI>Arabian,</HI> who was at work hard by, run to his succour, praying this Cava∣lier to be pacified; and from thence he came to give me a Blow with his Sword, but I gat my self out of his way, and he spurring his Horse upon me, cryed <HI>Rou,</HI> which is to say, Re∣turn; but my <HI>Turk</HI> so ordered the Matter, that he was content to take a Piece of Money, and the <HI>Arabian</HI> al∣so mightily desired him. After that, my <HI>Turk</HI> took away my white Tur∣bant, shewing him that I had one of the right Colour underneath, and that this which he had given me was to keep me from the Sun. This, with the Money, contented him, and pre∣served us from the Danger of being soundly beaten, and also of returning
<PB N="288" REF="25"/>
back to <HI>Sassa,</HI> where the Cafars and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Souba∣chins.</NOTE> Sub-Bassa's would not have pardon∣ed us. I then threw away his white Cap, contenting my self with my own, not having a mind ever to rely any more upon what he told me. We were in continual fear lest these Cafars should come after us, upon the Infor∣mation of this Cavalier, but they did not; yet my Turk was under such a mortal Apprehension that they would, that he turned about ever and anon, and pricked on the Ass as much as he could. We went to lie at <HI>Conetra</HI> in a Campo, where we payed a Ca∣far. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conetra.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Chelubin, which is to say the Lord of the Place, who understood a little of the <HI>Gemique</HI> Tongue, (which is corrupted <HI>Italian,)</HI> spake for me to the Cafars, that they might use me kindly, and take no more of me than he ordered them. He came with o∣ther Cavaliers of his Company to dis∣course with me where I was with my Ass in a Court; and having perceived my Kit or Gittern amongst my things, he desired me mightily to play upon it, which I willingly did, and pre∣sented
<PB N="289" REF="25"/>
him with a curious great Pom∣granate, which had been given me by one of the Bassa's of <HI>Damascus</HI>'s Gen∣tlemen. He was very well content therewith, and thought himself well payed for the Kindness he had done me with the Cafars. These Cafars <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cafars, or Toll-gathe∣rers.</NOTE> are the Farmers and Toll-gatherers of the <HI>Turk,</HI> and are always Three to∣gether; one for the Grand Signior, another for the Soldiers of the Coun∣try, and the third for the Soubachin, or Governor of the Place. I lay there in a Stable of Mules and Camels, up∣on a little Grass which I had bought, having no better Lodging that Night than my Ass.</P>
<P>We parted from thence about three Hours before Day, and found the Company which was going after the <HI>Chec-Marabou,</HI> who parted from <HI>Da∣mascus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chec▪Ma∣rabou.</NOTE> two Days before us, whom we overtook along by the Sea <HI>Tiberiades.</HI> This <HI>Chec-Marabou</HI> goes out every Year from <HI>Damascus,</HI> to go in Devo∣tion to <HI>Salomon</HI>'s Temple in <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> and those who go with him, (which are they of the Country,) pay nothing; they are sometimes 5
<PB N="290" REF="26"/>
or 6000. I was very glad to find this Company, for fear that my <HI>Turk</HI> should play me some Roguish Trick, though the <HI>Jew, Ibrahim,</HI> had made him put his Hand upon mine, promi∣sing, upon the Law of <HI>Mah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>met,</HI> to guard and protect me as himself, and to bring me back again to <HI>Damascus,</HI> or at least a Letter from me to this <HI>Jew:</HI> But yet I trusted not so much to that, as to make me neglect being upon my guard, knowing well the Humour of this cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed and unfaithful Race of People, who will kill a Man for a small matter, and especially the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Turks <HI>Co∣vetous and Wicked.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Christians,</HI> whom they greatly hate, and serve them only for their own Profit, of wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch they are as greedy as Hell can make 'em.</P>
<P>We passed then a great Number of Woods, and at length came to <HI>Jacob</HI>'s<HI>-B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idge,</HI> where there was a Cafar, through which passes a very swift Ri∣ver, which is that of <HI>Jordan,</HI> and which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jordan.</NOTE> runs from thence into the Sea <HI>Tiberi∣ades,</HI> not far distant from thence. These Cafars were <HI>Arabs;</HI> and my <HI>Turk</HI> think∣ing not to pay so much, to save some∣thing for himself, endeavour'd to per∣swade
<PB N="291" REF="26"/>
them that I was a <HI>Jew,</HI> and that I was going to <HI>Zaphet</HI> where their Sy∣nagogue <NOTE PLACE="marg">Zaphet.</NOTE> is; but these <HI>Arabs,</HI> who were very cunning and subtle, saw by my Looks that I was not like a <HI>Jew;</HI> and an old Man, all scorch'd and burnt with the Sun, asked me, <HI>Hady Frangi?</HI> which is as much as to say, if I was a <HI>Christian?</HI> My <HI>Turk,</HI> and another of our Company, earnestly entreated them not to take much of me, and that I was a poor miserable Wretch, and made me pass before with the o∣thers, they tarrying there to pay; but for all that, they payed much more, (or at least made me believe so) than I had done: But it behoved me to pass that way whether I would or not. When you have passed the Bridge, you see in this River a little Island, where there is an ancient Building, which they say to be <HI>Jacob</HI>'s House. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jacob<HI>'s House.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>From thence we passed through Deserts, where was a great Number of Tents of the <HI>Arabs</HI> on each side, and began to mend our pace for the great Fear we were in, without resting or refreshing our selves at all; and I was very angry with my <HI>Turk,</HI> who would
<PB N="292" REF="27"/>
not give me time to eat a bit of Bread, being very weak, having set out a little after Midnight, and made so much way; and besides, our evil For∣tune was not to find the least drop of Water to drink. When we had pas∣sed all these Habitations of <HI>Arabs,</HI> we went to pitch along by a Rock, where it was exceeding hot, and there seeking for Water we found some, though very little, which was Rain∣water kept there a long time. We had a mind to taste of it; but it was so bitter and stinking, that it was im∣possible to swallow the least drop thereof, tho' I formerly had drank that which had been very bad, and fancied that the Lizards, Serpents, and other venomous Creatures, which are there in abundance, had come to drink, and to plunge themselves there∣in. Our <HI>Turks,</HI> though they are ex∣ceeding dry, and are rustical and rough in their manner of living, could not drink the least drop thereof. By good Fortune I had still a Pomegranate or two left, of which I gave to every one a little bit to refresh their Mouths, not daring to eat any thereof before
<PB N="293" REF="27"/>
them, without giving them some, tho' I had very great need of it my self: But it behoved me so to do, if I had a mind to live quietly; my endeavour being to humour them as long as I was with them.</P>
<P>Thus passed we this troublesome Way as far as the Cistern of <HI>Joseph,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cistern of</HI> Joseph.</NOTE> where we drank some of the Water, which is very good and fresh, and fil∣led also our Teronques therewith. This Cistern is a little Place raised up, where there is a Building, in which live certain <HI>Arabs:</HI> It is covered with a Cupolo, sustained with Four Pillars of White Marble; but at present there is but Three entire, the other be∣ing broken.</P>
<P>Having drank enough, we went on our way; but these <HI>Arabs</HI> striving to force us to give them something for this Water, my <HI>Turk</HI> ran to hinder them from taking my Bread which I had brought from <HI>Damascus,</HI> where I was furnished with Provision for seve∣ral Days; but at last it behoved us to give them something: And thus esca∣ped we from their Hands, passing a∣long <NOTE PLACE="marg">Valley of the Five Loaves.</NOTE> by the <HI>Valley of the Five Loaves,</HI>
<PB N="294" REF="28"/>
where our Lord wrought that famous Miracle: From thence we came to the Sea of <HI>Tiberias,</HI> the 18th. of <HI>April,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sea of</HI> Ti∣berias.</NOTE> and found the <HI>Chec-Marabou,</HI> who was going to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to the Temple of <HI>Salomon,</HI> accompanied with 4 or 5000 Persons of all sorts. The Place where we were, was then called <HI>Lameny;</HI> there we pitched our Baggage hard by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lameny.</NOTE> a Bush, and in the mean time I went to bathe in this Sea, to ease and refresh my self a little: I found the Water thereof very sweet and still, and ex∣cellent good to drink, having a very soft Sand at the bottom. The River of <HI>Jordan</HI> passes with a very swift course just through the middle, with∣out mixing it self therewith, and from thence runs into the dead Sea near <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> from whence it is plainly to be seen from Mount <HI>Olivet;</HI> for it is in a Valley, having the Land of <HI>Arabia</HI> very high, and Desart on the other side, as I saw from Mount <HI>Olivet.</HI></P>
<P>This Place of <HI>Lameny</HI> hath Cafars, but I met with none of them: I there saw all these <HI>Marabouts Santons,</HI> who dance before the <HI>Chec</HI>'s Tent; and it is a fine sight to see them perform their
<PB N="295" REF="28"/>
Ceremonies and Follies, ranging them∣selves <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Danc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE> all into a Ring, as in a Dance, then clapping their Hands, and cry∣ing <HI>Nila Nilala;</HI> then bowing, and heaving themselves up with a great force: There was a <HI>San<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that led them by Signs of his Hands, Gestures, and Motions, like a Master of Musick, and who was in the mid∣dle of the Dance, following with his Face towards them. It would be im∣possible to represent all the great Fol∣lies and silly Tricks which they shew in these Dances; for there are some of them, who going out of the Dance, cast themselves all along upon the Ground; then two of these <HI>Santon-Marabouts</HI> take him, one by the Head, and the other by the Feet, and stretch him out as far as they can; after that, this Man pretends himself dead, and makes as tho' he had great Convul∣sions and Tremblings, shaking him∣self mightily two or three times, then seems as if he gave up the Ghost; the <HI>Marabouts</HI> seeing that he neither stirs nor takes his Breath, look upon him as a dead Man; he who is at the Head, takes his Right Hand, and puts it up∣on
<PB N="296" REF="29"/>
his Face, then does as much to his Left, and after that, puts them upon his Belly; he who is at the Feet plucks him very hard, and the other holding him by the Head raises him upon his Feet; whereupon presently this dead Man reviving, runs to dan∣cing with the others: They employ themselves thus 4 or 5 at a time, one after another, going to this fine Sport.</P>
<P>As I was beholding these Fooleries, there was a <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish</HI> Woman hard by me, who seeing all this, entred into such a Fransie, that she fell to shaking and crying out like the rest, so that they had much adoe to quiet her, ma∣king as if she had been ravished into an Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asie.</P>
<P>The Evening being come, they all fall to their <HI>Sala</HI> or Prayers, and light a great Number of Lamps before the Tent of the <HI>Chec-Marabou,</HI> who is the Captain of the other <HI>Santons</HI> and <HI>Ma∣rabous,</HI> placing before his Tent all the Standards, where there is writ in <HI>A∣rabick</HI> Letters something of the Law of <HI>Mahomet:</HI> Afterwards in the Morn∣ing, when the Caravan comes to de∣camp, all these <HI>Santons</HI> take every one,
<PB N="297" REF="29"/>
one of these Ensigns, and go singing be∣fore the <HI>Chec,</HI> who is encompass'd a∣bout with these Standards; then he mounts upon a fine Horse, with some other Cavaliers that accompany him, and march thus in great Ceremony before the Caravan.</P>
<P>As we thus parted from <HI>Lameny,</HI> my <HI>Turk</HI> took me out of the way of the <HI>Chec,</HI> telling me, That in the way where the <HI>Chec</HI> was to pass there was abundance of Water, which my Ass could not pass over: He thus deceived me on purpose, to make me pay the Cafars, with whom I believe he par∣ticipated. We went over Mountains very high, and almost inaccessible, with no small trouble; and there was also some <HI>Turkish</HI> Men and Women with us, who had taken this way as the best.</P>
<P>At Night we arrived at <HI>Eonjar,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eonjar.</NOTE> which is a place some two Musquet-shot from Mount <HI>Tabor:</HI> We thought <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mount</HI> Ta∣bor.</NOTE> the <HI>Chec</HI> would have come there also, but he came not that Day; which those of the Campo seeing, they cau∣sed us to enter into the Court for fear of the <HI>Arabs;</HI> and there I accommoda∣ted
<PB N="298" REF="30"/>
my self in the middle, with my Ass close by me. There was some <HI>Greeks</HI> who invited me to sup with them, giving me some Rice and parch'd Beans. After Supper, as I was going to sleep hard by my Bag∣gage in the Court, a Janisary, who came along with us that Day, with 3 or 4 <HI>Turkish</HI> Women, sent for me, (he being under a Vault, with a great Number of <HI>Arabs,)</HI> and invited me to eat some Almonds and Raisins <NOTE PLACE="marg">Turkish <HI>Courtesie.</HI></NOTE> with him; and besides that, spoke for me to the Cafars, so ordering the Business with them, that I should pay nothing, telling them that I came in Company of the <HI>Chec,</HI> where all was frank and free: But I was since shewed the contrary at <HI>Nabelous.</HI></P>
<P>We parted from that Place before Day with Three or Four <HI>Turkish</HI> Mer∣chants (the Janisary staying there to attend the Coming of the <HI>Chec)</HI> and came to <HI>Gigny,</HI> passing on Foot over Mount <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bor,</HI> which is very high, and elevated, covered with Trees like Oaks, bearing Acorns, with Leaves which prick like Holly-Oak. This Mountain is above a League high,
<PB N="299" REF="30"/>
and the Circuit of it is near Three, the top whereof is plain, and had formerly some sort of Building and Dwelling-place for Hermits, but all is ruined; the Country round about is nothing else but Woods.</P>
<P><HI>Gigny</HI> is a little City; where being <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gigny</NOTE> come, we went to put our selves into the Court of the Castle during the great Heat of the Sun; and being there, a great many <HI>Arabian</HI> Cafars came armed with Bows, Arrows, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rude Treatment of the Au∣thor.</NOTE> Darts, and Harquebuzes, who en∣compassed me about like ravenous Wolves, crying out <HI>Alcafar ard Dre∣hen,</HI> Give us Money. I excused my self after the best manner I could, that I might not give them all which they demanded; but the Master Cafar, with∣out saying a Word to me, at my first Re∣fusal, gave me such a Blow upon the Shoulders, that he broke his Staff, and presently sent for another as big as his Arm, with which he treated me so cruelly, that I was forced to give them as much as they would have. My wicked <HI>Turk</HI> all this while was gotten far enough from me, and cau∣sed this Tragedy to be acted, having
<PB N="300" REF="31"/>
for that purpose led me out of the way of the <HI>Chec,</HI> that he might the more easily rob me: When he was returned, I gave him Money, telling him that he might go his ways where he would, and that I would have no more to do with such a wicked Man in my Company: But he told me that he was obliged to bring me safe to <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> and to bring News from me back to <HI>Damascus,</HI> if I returned not with him: Finally, I was forced to bear with this Tyrant, who was ne∣ver content with what I gave him, and besides denied what I had given him at <HI>Damascus</HI> for Advance, and that which I gave him also at <HI>Gigny,</HI> thinking to have it over again.</P>
<P>We departed thus from <HI>Gigny</HI> the 22d. of <HI>April,</HI> and came to <HI>Caranouby,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caranou∣by.</NOTE> a Place of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> in the Coun∣try; and there the <HI>Arabs</HI> came from all Parts to see me, being on Horse∣back, with Launces in the manner of Pikes, for that is their ordinary Arms: They endeavoured to rob us; but some of them were pursued by those of the Caravan, who cast Darts, Stones and Clubs at them, and the <HI>Arabs</HI> rode
<PB N="301" REF="31"/>
away like Lightning through the middle of the Fields. There was one of them taken, who was led before the <HI>Chec,</HI> who caused him to be soundly Bastinado'd for his Theft.</P>
<P>Now my <HI>Turk</HI> who sought nothing more than to ease me of my Money, stirred up two <HI>Arabians</HI> to demand <HI>Al∣cafar</HI> of me, or Tribute. I was not a little surprized at that, seeing my self in the open Fields, where there was not any appearance of a Cafar; however, I told them that I owed them nothing in that Place: But my <HI>Turk,</HI> who had brought them, urged me very hard to pay it, that he might have his Share thereof, yet I would not give them any thing; and seeing my self near the Tent of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Gentleman, I took the more Heart, knowing very well that he would not suffer me to be abused; so these <HI>Arabs</HI> were forced to go their ways as they came. But my Traytor, the <HI>Turk,</HI> bore me a Spite, and acted the same in a very base manner; for the next Day parting from <HI>Caranouby,</HI> and passing through the City of <HI>Herodes,</HI> where St. <HI>John</HI> was beheaded, and
<PB N="302" REF="32"/>
where still a great Number of Marble-Pillars are standing, and Olive-Trees very old, we came to <HI>Nabelous,</HI> a great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabelous.</NOTE> City, which is said to be <HI>Samaria.</HI> The <HI>Chec</HI> went to pitch his Tent in a great Enclosure, a quarter of a League be∣low the City; and then my <HI>Turk</HI> put∣ting me close by an Olive-Tree, with my Baggage, and my Ass, went straight away to give the Cafars notice: I was a good way from the Tents, and this Villain had separated me from the Company of Three <HI>Turks</HI> that were Brothers, very civil Men, where I was left alone amongst the poor <HI>Arabs</HI> who followed us to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> As I was thus under the Olive-Tree, eating of that little which I had; for I could find nothing, save a little Paste fryed in Oil, two <HI>Arabian</HI> Cafars came to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cafars Ty∣rannous towards the</HI> Chri∣stians.</NOTE> me, and without a Word speaking, one takes me by the Throat, dragging me along, and the other belaboured me with a Cudgel behind, making me go by force, pretending to lead me be∣fore the Soubachin at <HI>Nabelous.</HI> I could do nothing else in this Extremity, but call God to my Succour, and He for∣sook me not: For at that Instant, a
<PB N="303" REF="32"/>
very honest <HI>Turkish</HI> Gentleman seeing me thus basely used by these cruel Rascals, came out of his Tent, and took me by force <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of their Hands, demanding of them what they would have for their Right? they asked Se∣ven Sequins; which was a vast Summ out of the little Money I had remain∣ing. At last this <HI>Turk</HI> so perswaded them in my Behalf, that they were contented with Six Pataques, which are worth about a Crown apiece, which he caus'd one of his Servants to carry for 'em. But afterwards one of these Cafars returned again, de∣manding of me half a Pataque more, and that by the same means I should go thank the <HI>Chec,</HI> the which it beho∣ved me to do, by the Counsel of this <HI>Turkish</HI> Gentleman; and this Cafar gave me a little Paper, wherein was imprinted the Grand Signior's Mark. Behold the Treatment which I had at <HI>Nabelous,</HI> where the Christians are ex∣treamly tyrannized over.</P>
<P>A little below this Place is a very fine Fountain, adorned with Marble and Stone; they say it is <HI>Jac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b</HI>'s Well, or that of the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman. In
<PB N="304" REF="33"/>
the Evening my <HI>Turk</HI> came to me a∣gain, pretending ignorance of what had happened: But it behoved me to endure that also, and overlook it as my best way. The <HI>Chec</HI> continued two or three Days at <HI>Nabelous</HI> touch∣ing the Sick; for they present these sick People to him, and he stretches out their Arms and Legs: then for his Pains he has Money given him, which his Secretary receives, giving little Tickets like Countercharms, and Notes for it.</P>
<P>We had there great Rains, which we were forced to endure Day and and Night very patiently, without having any thing to shelter us<HI>:</HI> But seeing it continued without ceasing, I placed my self with these Three <HI>Turkish</HI> Brethren, not trusting my self any longer with my <HI>Turk,</HI> and fol∣lowed them into the City, with my little Baggage, not knowing then where this my gallant <HI>Mouquary</HI> was. We took up our Quarters in an old Vault full of Spiders: This Vault is <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Anci∣ent Vault.</NOTE> so ancient, that they say 'tis above Three Thousand Years since it was made. In this Place lodge the Ca∣mels,
<PB N="305" REF="33"/>
and the Caravans, which go and come. I tarried thus in this dark Hall amongst the Mules and Asses, not having my self so much as a Wisp of Straw to lie upon, and being so crowded that I could not lie down, but was forced to remain close by my Ass, who was very impatient; for I cou'd get him nothing to eat.</P>
<P>Having there passed this bad Wea∣ther, the next Day my <HI>Turk</HI> came to seek me out, pretending himself to be mighty busie in looking for me; but he was a Drunkard, and minded nothing else but drinking of Shirbet, which was sold in the Tents, from which he never stirred all the Day long, nor the very Night, and would fain have perswaded me also to go there to drink of this Liquor, which they swallow down hot: It's of a very unsavoury Tast, and blackish Colour; the <HI>Syrians</HI> call it <HI>Cody.</HI> In <HI>Tripoly</HI> are a great many Vaults like Taverns, where they most commonly go to drink this Shirbet, which is made of Seed and Water boiled to∣gether.</P>

Leaving this Place, we went to pitch our Tents two or three Leagues from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in a Place where for∣merly was a Chapel, which is half ruined, and there is a pleasant Foun∣tain hard by upon the way.</P>
<P>The 27th. of <HI>April,</HI> 1612. we ar∣rived <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrival at</HI> Jerusalem.</NOTE> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and were there first<HI>:</HI> Not far from the City I met with the Soubachy, or Governour, who came out with a great Number of Cavaliers, and all in good order, going to meet the <HI>Chec-Marabou.</HI> This Soubachy ask'd me if I was a Chri∣stian; and having answered, Yes, he commanded my <HI>Turk</HI> to take me to the Gate of <HI>Jafe,</HI> and to leave me there at the Gate until he had fetched me a Trucher-Man, which was a <HI>Greek,</HI> belonging to the Cadi or Judge. My <HI>Turk</HI> failed not to do what the other had commanded him, and made me tarry at the Gate of <HI>Jafe,</HI> where I was a long time waiting for the Trucher-Men, and an Officer of the Cadi, to visit my Baggage. They being come, caused me to enter into the City, and led me where the Re∣ligious dwell, where they view'd my
<PB N="307" REF="34"/>
things, leaving me with these good Men, whom I saluted. After Dinner, they gave me a <HI>Greek</HI> Trucher-Man to accompany me to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> whi∣ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bethle∣hem.</NOTE> I went, passing by the Fish-pond of <HI>Bersabee,</HI> and drank at a Foun∣tain which is upon the Bridge: From <NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of several Holy Pla∣ces.</NOTE> thence we went to the Turpentine-Tree, where the Blessed Virgin repo∣sed her self, going from <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> then to the Cistern, or Well, where the Star appeared to the Three Kings going to Worship our Lord; my Trucher-Man made me to drink of the Water which is very good<HI>:</HI> Not far from that Place we saw <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Tower, which is almost quite ruined; after that, the Place where the Pro∣phet <HI>Ely</HI> slept, upon a Rock along by the Highway; they shewed me still the Mark of his Body in the Rock: From thence we went to see the Field of the Shepherds, and near to that, the Five Cisterns which <HI>David</HI> caused to be made; there are Three of them open, and the other Two stopped up; they are all round in a Ring, some Three or Four Foot one from the o∣ther, about a little Stone's-cast from
<PB N="308" REF="35"/>
the Highway: We there found some <HI>Grecian</HI> Women, and Maids, who were drawing Water, which my Trucher-Man caused me also to drink of, being very excellent. When we came to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> we went into the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monastery of</HI> Bethle∣hem.</NOTE> Monastery, which is a Place very a∣greeable; and then the Father Guar∣dian, a good and devout Religious Old Man, put on his Ornaments, and gave me a lighted Wax-Tapor, shew∣ing me all the Holy Places, and a∣mongst others, the Place where our Lord was born; then the Place where the Three Kings worshipped, and and that where St. <HI>Jerome</HI> was buried, and other Places: But should I give an Account of all, I wou'd never have done; I therefore remit my Read∣er to the more particular Descriptions which have been made of these Pla∣ces.</P>
<P>After having visited this Holy Place, on <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning the 28th. of <HI>April,</HI> and heard Mass, which was said upon the Manger, and bought some Beads which the <HI>Greeks</HI> make there, I went to see the Grotto where the Virgin fled, when <HI>Herod</HI> slew the
<PB N="309" REF="35"/>
Innocents. As I was coming out of this Place, I met some <HI>Greek</HI> Women, who came to desire me to give some Remedy to their sick Chil∣dren, because they had heard that I was a Haquin, or Surgion. I instru∣cted them, according to my small Ca∣pacity, and as that Place would per∣mit. Round about the City of <HI>Beth∣lehem</HI> are Vineyards: It is now no∣thing but a lttle Village, full of old Ruines; and not far from thence is a Monastery, the Ruines of the City of <HI>Bethuly,</HI> where there is no Habita∣tion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bethuly.</NOTE></P>
<P>As for the Place of the Manger, it is at this Day nothing but an old strong Vault, sustained with little Pillars of Marble to keep it from fal∣ling: The Vault is gilt with counter∣feit Gold; they descend by ten or a dozen Steps: In the Place of the Man∣ger is a great Marble-Stone.</P>
<P>After that, I reassumed my way to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> where being come, it be∣hoved me to sell my Ass to maintain me, as well at the entrance of the Holy Sepulchre, where I was to give 14 Sequins, which are about Twenty
<PB N="310" REF="36"/>
Crowns; as also to give my <HI>Turk,</HI> who so insulted over me, that I could scarce find Money enough to content him: He brought one of the Citiers, or Serjeants of the Cadi, to have me be∣fore his Master. When I had payed him by the Hands of my Trucher-Man, yet he almost deny'd that I had given him any thing, and would have done it, had not this Trucher-Man been with me to witness that I had payed him; and he was then conten∣ted: yet he alledged, that he had bought me an Ass, not having Money enough to pay for him, as if it beho∣ved me to pay it, as if I had been obli∣ged thereto, and that I had not given him enough for the Courtesie, which he would shew to be as much as the Principal which I had agreed with him for a Month. In the end, seeing my self so pestered with this Man, who threatened to have me before the Ca∣di, or Judge of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> I was for∣ced to pluck a Ring from my Finger, and give it him in the presence of the Trucher-Man. But I saw him no <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Author quits his</HI> Turk.</NOTE> more, since I gave him a Letter to the <HI>Jew, Abraham Rabbi,</HI> to shew him
<PB N="311" REF="36"/>
that he had put me safe and found in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as he had promised.</P>
<P>The <HI>Saturday</HI> following, in the E∣vening, some Pilgrims that were there, and I, went to the Holy Sepulchre to do our Devotions; the Governour of the City having sent the Keys upon Request that was made to him, being there were lately Pilgrims arrived; and in entring the Church they cried to me <HI>Hada,</HI> which is to say, that I came the last; for the others had been there already to do their Devotions some Days before, and were minded to return there again upon this occa∣sion: Being there, we went all in Pro∣cession; and the Father <HI>Bucher,</HI> a Cordelier, made a Sermon, shewing us every Place where our Saviour had suffered any Pain; as the Place where is the Pillar to which he was tyed and scourged: Then we went to the Holy Grave, where he lay and was buried; this is like a little Cupolo, having within, a great Number of lighted Lamps, and an Altar where they say Mass, which is upon the Sepulchre it self<HI>:</HI> From thence we went to Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> and saw the Hole
<PB N="312" REF="37"/>
where the Cross was fasten'd, which is garnished on the inside with Silver; the Rock hard by, is slit to the bottom; there are some Signs of a Chapel be∣low. After having heard there a short Sermon, we went to the Place where our Saviour was set, having the Crown of Thorns upon his Head; then where he was put Prisoner to wait for his Death and Passion, where he was a∣nointed, which is a Stone of Marble as big as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omb, compassed with Bars of Iron; and in short, all the Holy Places of Devotion which are within the Enclosure of the Holy Se∣pulchre. After that, at Break-of-Day, I heard Mass in this Place of the Ho∣ly Sepulchre, Confessing my self, and Communicating as devoutly as I could, in a Place so Holy and Venerable, and that with so much Contentment and Satisfaction, that I don't believe I ever received the like; rendering infinite Thanks to my God, for ha∣ving preserved me from so many Pe∣rils and Dangers, and for having brought me into this Holy Place, here to do the Duties of a good Christian and Catholick.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="37"/>
Having thus finished my Devoti∣ons, I returned back to the Monastery, and after Dinner taking one of the Religious, with one named <HI>Grand Fils,</HI> a <HI>Parisian,</HI> who was also there: We went to the Street which is ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led <HI>Do∣lorous</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy Pla∣ce.</NOTE> through which our Lord pas∣sed, bearing his Cross; we there saw the Place from whence <HI>Veronica</HI> threw the Linnen from her Door upon our Lord's Face; then where <HI>Pilate</HI> said <HI>Ecce Homo;</HI> and the Places where St. <HI>Paul</HI> was put into Prison, where St. <HI>Stephen</HI> was Stoned, where the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was Buried; the Sepul∣chres of <HI>Joseph,</HI> and St. <HI>Anne;</HI> the Place or Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> where our Saviour ascended into Heaven, leaving the Prints of his Feet in the Rock, but at present there is nothing left but the print of his Left Foot; the <HI>Turks</HI> ha∣ving transported the Right into <HI>Solo∣mon</HI>'s Temple, as I was there told: Then the Place where our Lord wept over <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> the Place where <HI>Ju∣das</HI> hang'd himself, where <HI>Lazarus</HI> was raised from the Dead, where the Three <HI>Maries</HI> went to seek our Lord, to desire him to come to see their Bro∣ther;
<PB N="314" REF="38"/>
and the Stone is still to be seen which our Lord sate upon: Then the Castle of <HI>Eniaus,</HI> where he made the Feast, where he healed the Blind, where St. <HI>Peter</HI> wept for his Fault<HI>:</HI> Then the Sepulchre of <HI>Absolon,</HI> which is cut in the Rock like a Tower, ha∣ving upon it a Head of a wonderful bigness, and there is a Window on the side towards the Valley of <HI>Jehosaphat,</HI> through which they say the Children still cast Stones as they pass by, out of disdain that <HI>Absolon</HI> had made War upon his Father: Then the Place where our Lord fell into the Torrent of <HI>Cedron,</HI> the Marks of his Arms and Hands still remaining upon the Rock: Then where he was Interro∣gated u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der the Golden Gate; where he was put in Prison, in the House of <HI>Ann,</HI> upon Mount <HI>Sion;</HI> the Olive-Tree to which he was tyed, which is still green, and raised from the Ground round about; the <HI>Greeks</HI> hold this Place: Then the Stone of the Sepul∣chre, the Place where St. <HI>James</HI> was Beheaded, where <HI>Abraham</HI> would have sacrificed his Son <HI>Isaac,</HI> which the <HI>Ae∣thiopians</HI> keep, and which is near to
<PB N="315" REF="38"/>
the Sepulchre. In short, all the o∣ther Holy Places which are in <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> and thereabouts, as they were shewed us by these Religious who conducted us.</P>
<P>Now for the City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jerusalem <HI>Described.</HI></NOTE> it is at this Day mightily diminished, from what it formerly was, it may be about as big as <HI>Blois,</HI> and is situated upon a Heighth amongst Mountains, not having any thing of plane but to∣ward the side <HI>Jafa:</HI> 'Tis encompas∣sed about with good Walls, built not so much in compass as was the an∣cient City, which was very great, as the Circuit and Ruines do still shew: They have left Mount <HI>Sion</HI> out, to take in that of <HI>Calvary.</HI> All the City is full of Ruines, and ancient Vaults, and inhabited by People of all Nations and Religions, as <HI>Jews, Greeks, Latins, Moors, Turks.</HI> The Governour of the City is called the Soubachin, who de∣pends upon the Bassa of <HI>Damascus</HI> The Temple of <HI>Solomon</HI> is built very great and high, covered with Lead, and gilded; and all round about is built Places like Chapels<HI>:</HI> It is built with Freestone. This Place serves
<PB N="316" REF="39"/>
them for a Mosque, where the <HI>Turks</HI> will not suffer either the <HI>Christians,</HI> or <HI>Jews,</HI> to enter. The Country round about, as all the rest of the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> is incultivated and desart, full of old Buildings, and Ruines, and is very stony. In short, it throughly feels all over, and in every Place, the grievous Curse of Almighty God, for the Iniquities of the People whom he so loved, for whose sake he render'd this Country the most Agreeable and Fruitful in the whole World. This may serve for an Example to us <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> at this Day, who do so badly observe his Holy Law, to which, by his Grace, he has called us in the room of those whom he has cast off, for their Disobedience and Ingratitude. When I had satisfied my curious De∣votion in all this, I came back to the Monastery, and the next Day I pre∣pared for my Return, taking a Mule of the <HI>Atelas,</HI> and a Guide and Tru∣cherman of the <HI>Christians,</HI> who was a <HI>Greek,</HI> to whom I gave Seven Se∣quins.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="39"/>
I then left <HI>Jerusalem</HI> on a <HI>Monday,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parting from</HI> Jeru∣salem.</NOTE> and passed through the Valley of <HI>Te∣rebinte,</HI> where <HI>David</HI> overcame <HI>Go∣liah.</HI> In this Place we found a great Number of Cafars, but the <HI>Atelas</HI> spake for me to them, and so freed me from that Penalty.</P>
<P>From thence we passed by the House of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> from which runs a pleasant Fountain, which Passengers drink of: Then we came to <HI>Ramah,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramah.</NOTE> a little City, where we lodged at the <HI>French</HI> Consul's House, and the next Morning went to <HI>Jafa,</HI> tarrying there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jafa</NOTE> all that Day, waiting for the next Morning; we lay under an old Vault along by the Sea-side. This was a great City, and a good Port, but now all in Ruines, and there is but Three Towers to be seen entire, and some little Houses: There is here nothing to be found either to eat or drink, and you must bring your Provision if you have a mind to eat. The Morn∣ing being come, the <HI>Atelas</HI> giving order for our embarking, and having given us a <HI>Greek,</HI> with a great Boat like a Patache, we parted from thence
<PB N="318" REF="40"/>
the 1st. Day of <HI>May,</HI> and came to the City of <HI>Caesarea,</HI> which is quite ru∣ined, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caesarea.</NOTE> and went to cast Anchor near <HI>Caiphas,</HI> in a Place where was for∣merly a Monastery. We went on shore to look for some fresh Water, and were refreshed by bathing our selves: There was with us a <HI>Turkish</HI> Chiaux, and a Janisary.</P>
<P>The next Morning leaving this Place, we went and cast Anchor a lit∣tle below Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> where <HI>Elias</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mount</HI> Carmel.</NOTE> made his Abode; then passing along by St. <HI>John of Acre,</HI> formerly <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole∣medes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acre.</NOTE> a very pleasant City, upon the Sea-side, and where dwelt formerly the Knights of <HI>Malta;</HI> then we anchored before the City of <HI>Tyre,</HI> where some of us went on shore for Victuals, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyre.</NOTE> to see the Place where, they say, <HI>Samp∣son</HI> threw down the Temple upon the <HI>Philistines:</HI> This Place is all desart and ruined, and there is a great Num∣ber of Marble Pillars, and amongst others, one of a wonderful length and breadth, very smooth, and almost Seven Fathoms about, and seems as if there were Three in one, 'tis broke at one end: They say it is that which
<PB N="319" REF="40"/>
<HI>Sampson</HI> cast down, but that is false; for the Scripture tells us, that this was at <HI>Gaza,</HI> another City far from <HI>Tyre;</HI> so that these Pillars must be of some other ancient Building. We took some Refreshments in the House of a <HI>Greek,</HI> who makes Brandy under an old Vault. At Evening we returned to our Petache, designing to set sail af∣ter Midnight. As for the rest, this City of <HI>Tyre,</HI> or <HI>Sur,</HI> is quite ruined, inhabited only by some <HI>Moors,</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Christians, which live there in Vaults under the Ground. There is to be seen a great Number of Marble Pillars which keep up the Walls, be∣ing placed and layed cross one upon another, to hinder the Sea from un∣dermining the Walls. This City was once of a vast Extent, but at present is like a Desart.</P>
<P>Parting from this Place before Day, we cast Anchor at <HI>Sydon,</HI> or <HI>Sayette,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sydon.</NOTE> where we saw upon a little Hill the House of the <HI>Canaanite,</HI> hard by the Sea-side. We went on shore for some Refreshments, and dined in the Ware-House of the Christians, with the Con∣sul of that Place, who told me that
<PB N="320" REF="41"/>
some Days before came there a Ship <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fortune of a Ship of</HI> Malta.</NOTE> of <HI>Malta,</HI> who had a Protection from M. <HI>Joseph Facardin,</HI> Governor of <HI>Sy∣don,</HI> and that this Vessel returning in∣to the Sea to look for some Prize, had met with a <HI>Turkish</HI> Caramousin, whom she took, and boarded her with some Knights and Soldiers, who leaving their Admiral some Leagues from thence, came to <HI>Sydon</HI> to take in some Refreshments, and by chance the Bro∣ther of him who had lost the Ship was there at that time; who, when he saw his Brother's Ship, he cried out to the <HI>Moors</HI> of the City, How was it possi∣ble that they would suffer those Dogs, the Christian Robbers, (for so they call us,) to come thus within their very Port, after having taken their Goods. Whereupon those of the Ci∣ty immediately ran to Arms, and leap∣ing into Boats, fell upon this Cara∣mousin, and fought them on all sides: They within defended themselves va∣liantly, as long as their Powder lasted, but the most part of them being killed or wounded, the rest were forced to yield, and be carried into the City, where they had their Heads chopped
<PB N="321" REF="41"/>
off, being 16 in all. A few Days af∣terwards the Admiral sent his Boat to <HI>Sydon,</HI> to enquire after his Men; but there was Seven or Eight of them ar∣rested and made Prisoners while I was there. The Consul told me more∣over, That M. <HI>Joseph Facardin</HI> had promised him to let them escape in the Night-time, without the Know∣ledge of the People who were exaspe∣rated against them.</P>
<P>This <HI>Emir Joseph,</HI> commonly cal∣led the <HI>Ermine of Sydon,</HI> or <HI>Emir de Say∣ede,</HI> is very courteous and kind to the Christians, and is said to be de∣scended from those ancient Kings of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who were of the Blood of the Princes of <HI>France;</HI> and this is he who is said to be since come into <HI>Tus∣cany</HI> to the great Duke, with an In∣tention to become Christian, and to propose Means to the Christian Prin∣ces how to chase the <HI>Turks</HI> from those Parts.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Sydon,</HI> we went to lie at <HI>Baruth,</HI> which is a Place very pleasant <NOTE PLACE="marg">Baruth</NOTE> and delectable, having two little For∣tresses upon the Sea-side. They say that this <HI>Baruth</HI> is the Place where
<PB N="322" REF="42"/>
St. <HI>George</HI> slew the Dragon, and deli∣vered the Maid, as the Pourtrayes shew which are made thereupon.</P>
<P>The next Day, the 6th. of <HI>May,</HI> we arrived at <HI>Tripoly,</HI> where I conti∣nued <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tripoly▪</NOTE> for some Days, employing my self in gathering certain curious Plants, bearing excellent and odoriferous Flow∣ers, of which I gathered a great quan∣tity upon Mount <HI>Lebanus,</HI> and about the City of <HI>Tripoly;</HI> all which I lay'd safe up to carry to the King, as at my Arrival at <HI>Paris</HI> they were planted in the Garden of the <HI>Lovre</HI> which is be∣fore His Majesty's Chamber, whom I shewed several excellent Flowers.</P>
<P>The Bassa of <HI>Tripoly</HI> is a Man very Proud and Cruel; and I was told there, That once he being amorous of a very beautiful young Woman of one of the best Houses in the City, and seeing that he could not bring his Desires to pass by any sort of Artifice, he resolved to use Violence; and watching his opportunity when she went to the Stoves with her Mother, as it was their Custom; where pre∣sently going, he took this poor young <NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbarous Cruelty of a Bassa.</NOTE> Woman by force, and having-had his
<PB N="323" REF="42"/>
Will of her, he took his Gangear, or Knife, made in the form of a Croi∣sant, and ript her open quite from the Privy-Parts up to the Neck. Behold how these Barbarians give Satisfa∣ction to their desires, how horrible and wicked sover they be!</P>
<P>I was also told how that this Bassa, at the Arrival of a certain <HI>French</HI> Ship, called the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> belonging to the Sieur <HI>de Moisset,</HI> had a mind to go on board her, where having been treated with all the Complaisance ima∣ginable, at his coming out from thence one of his Favourites reproached him for eating with the Christians; at which he was in such a Fury, that he cast his Gangear at him, with which he so wounded him, that had not the Surgeon immediately dressed him, he had died thereof upon the Place. They relate several other cruel Acts and Violences of this Man, which are very ordinary and common to all these Race of Infidels.</P>
<P>After having tarried some time at <HI>Tripoly,</HI> I parted from thence the 18th. of <HI>May,</HI> and embarked to return to <HI>France.</HI> We passed along by the
<PB N="324" REF="43"/>
Isle of <HI>Cyprus</HI> the 21 st. and the 25th. we saw the Coast of <HI>Turkey,</HI> then the Mounts of <HI>Phenico</HI> and <HI>Sately,</HI> and not <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mounts of</HI> Pheni∣co, <HI>and</HI> Sately. Rhodes. Candia.</NOTE> far from the Isle of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> which we left towards the North-West. After that, we passed by the Isle of <HI>Candiae,</HI> where we espied Two <HI>Turkish</HI> Cara∣mousins, driving full sail upon us; but when they saw themselves too weak for our Vessel, they tacked about a∣gain: We chased them with our Shot, but Night coming on, they escaped us; they being in great Fear, and u∣sing their utmost endeavour with Sails and Oars to get themselves out of our reach. From thence we passed along by the Isle of <HI>Malta,</HI> and the 12th. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malta.</NOTE> of <HI>June</HI> faw the Isle of <HI>Sardania,</HI> which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sardania.</NOTE> we left to the North-East; and in the end, by the Grace of God, arrived at <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrival in</HI> France.</NOTE> <HI>Marsailles</HI> the 19th. of <HI>June.</HI> I made not long stay there, but only to carry a Letter which I had for Monsieur the First President of <HI>Varix,</HI> at <HI>Aix,</HI> from whence I returned again to <HI>Marsailles,</HI> and from thence came streight to <HI>Paris,</HI> where I arrived the 24th. of <HI>July,</HI> 1612. <HI>For which, God be Praised for evermore.</HI></P>

<HEAD>BOOK VI.</HEAD>
<P>BEING returned from <HI>Syria,</HI> and the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> with quan∣tity of curious Plants, and o∣ther rare things, which by my dili∣gent Search in several Places I had procured to present to the King, and
<PB N="326" REF="44"/>
Queen-Regent, I failed not, so soon as I came to <HI>Paris,</HI> to go do my Re∣verence to Their Majesties, who were very glad to see my Rarities, and com∣manded that a fit Place should be given me in their Palace of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabinet in the</HI> Thuil∣leries.</NOTE> there to frame a Cabinet of all sorts of Rarities, and other curious things which I had gathered together in all my Travels throughout the World. But after having so well begun what I had at that time in hand, I judged that to pursue it according to my De∣sire, it would be necessary for me to undertake some more Voyages, and I had no less design than to encompass the whole World, first by way of the Occident, and from thence by the O∣rient to return again into our Occi∣dent; an Enterprize, I must confess, so great, that the only Presumption of so much as ever having it in my Mind, I believe would have gained me Glory enough; and yet I hoped, that by the Grace of him who had al∣ways conducted me every where, I should have been able to have brought it to pass. But I was defeated of these my Purposes by the Occasions following.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="44"/>
With this Intention then I left <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> and followed Their Majesties to <HI>Tours,</HI> in the Voyage which they made there in the Year 1614. in <HI>July.</HI> From thence I embarked upon the Ri∣ver <HI>Loir,</HI> to go to <HI>Nantes,</HI> and to St. <HI>Leiger,</HI> to wait for occasion and conveniency to pass to <HI>Portugal,</HI> from whence I was to pursue my Designs. But having put out to Sea, the Wind turned so contrary, that we were for∣ced to draw back to St. <HI>Leiger,</HI> tho' not without a deal of Trouble; and there hearing that the King was at <HI>Nants,</HI> I took the Occasion to go there to furnish my self with some Pass∣ports which I had forgotten, and which I judged needful for my Voy∣age.</P>
<P>This being done, I returned to St. <HI>Leger,</HI> but I found that the Vessel in my absence had set sail, having a right Wind; and which was worse, had also carried away all my Provi∣sions which I provided for the Passage, with some other things, which I never could hear of since. This was a great Hindrance to me, and also an unlucky Presage for my grand Design. Yet it hindred
<PB N="328" REF="45"/>
me not from embarking as well as I <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in∣to</HI> Spain.</NOTE> could in another Ship of <HI>Aulonne</HI> which was going to <HI>Andalusia:</HI> The Ship was called the <HI>Florisand,</HI> and the Master <HI>Franchois Micha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI> We first of all put in at <HI>Aulonne,</HI> then with a right Wind we set out Seven or Eight in Consort, for so many Ships we were in all, bearing to wards <HI>Spain;</HI> and having continued some time upon the Sea, and given chase to some Cruisers, we arrived in the Cape of St. <HI>Vincent;</HI> and taking Cognizance of the Cape, we ran along by the shore near the Port <HI>des Algerves,</HI> where some of our Ships anchored to Traffick, and the rest bore to <HI>San Lu∣car de Baramede,</HI> where our Ship was bound, being laden with Cloth.</P>
<P>Being arrived in this Place, I began to think of some way how to transport my self to <HI>Sevilia,</HI> to get Knowledge as well in Physick, and the Art of A∣pothecaries, (of which the Practise is something different from ours,) as al∣so to find means to pass to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and accomplish the Voyage which I had proposed to my self; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Design of the Great Voyage.</NOTE> which was to go streight to <HI>Mexico,</HI>

and from thence to embark for the Coast of the South-Sea, and so to fol∣low the Coast of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> a∣long by <HI>China, Camboja, Siam, Mala∣ca, Peru, Bengall, Coromandel, Mala∣bar, Goa, Diu, Ormus,</HI> and from thence to return by Land through <HI>Persia,</HI> and <HI>Babylon,</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and from thence by Sea repair to <HI>France,</HI> my own native Country; thus to accom∣plish so great a Voyage, and by the Example of those famous Heroes, <HI>Magallan, Drake, Cavendish,</HI> and <HI>Oli∣ver Van d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Nort,</HI> to encompass the whole Universe. But God had other∣ways disposed thereof, and for my own Good; his Pleasure being always Just, for his own Glory and our Sal∣vation.</P>
<P>Parting then from <HI>San Lucar,</HI> fol∣lowing the <HI>Mareme,</HI> along by the great River <HI>Guadalquivir,</HI> I came to <HI>Seville,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Seville.</NOTE> and immediately placed my self in the Shop of the most famous Apothe∣cary of the whole City, in the Street called <HI>di los Francos:</HI> The Master was named <HI>Alonso Rodrigo,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> with whom I continued for some time, both to learn the Language, of which
<PB N="330" REF="46"/>
I had already some Knowledge, and to have also some Knowledge of Drugs, of which this Man made the greatest Traffick: For he had Two or Three great Magazines in his House, and as much or more in other Places of the City, where his Children put off the Drugs.</P>
<P>After having tarried some time with him, I left him, for the great Desire I had to find an Occasion to embark; but I was still detained by another, named <HI>Juan Sancha,</HI> who had also dwelt with this <HI>Rodrigo,</HI> and was Apothecary to the Army, and the Frontier Cities in <HI>Africa,</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> He was to have a Shop at <HI>Marmorre,</HI> a Place which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had newly taken in <HI>Barbary,</HI> and la∣boured mightily to perfect this Shop which he was to send to this Fortress. I tarried then to help him, and conti∣nued there from the 3d. of <HI>November</HI> to the 8th. of <HI>January,</HI> until his Shop was finished. From thence I went to walk in the Fields to take the fresh Air, because of the great Filth of this City of <HI>Seville,</HI> which causes there
<PB N="331" REF="46"/>
a very bad Air, which is pursued by a great Number of Diseases.</P>
<P>As I was traversing on Foot some Mountains, to observe the Nature of Trees, I met with an honest Cavalier, named <HI>Pedro Sancha,</HI> as I knew since, who courteously invited me to come and lodge at his House in a little City called <HI>Corea,</HI> or <HI>Coria,</HI> not far from thence, which I could not well refuse. He entertained me very kindly, and I stayed there till the next Day; then I reassumed my way to the Mountains, where I was for some Days taking no∣tice of the Plants, and found store of Rosemary, and a great quantity of Mastick-Trees, with which the Coun∣try is mighty abounding; amongst o∣thers, I gathered some Thistles called <HI>Chameleonis-Ally,</HI> some Flowers of Nar∣cissus, and some Mandrake-Apples, which they call <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bollas de Villana:</HI> After that, when I saw that I had but bad Entertainment in these Desarts, where most commonly I found no∣thing but Water, and some Raisins to eat, and sometimes a little Bread, in the Shepherd's Cabins, I returned towards <HI>Corea,</HI> and visited my honest
<PB N="332" REF="47"/>
Host, the Sieur <HI>Pedro Sanche,</HI> who was very glad to see me, and made very much of me. He afterwards came to see me at <HI>Seville,</HI> to have the Interpretation of some Receipts which had been given him for his Wife who was with Child.</P>
<P>From thence I returned to <HI>Seville,</HI> where the Sieur <HI>Juan Sanche,</HI> the A∣pothecary, would have perswaded me to tarry with him; but I had my Voyage of the <HI>Indies</HI> so in my Head, that I had no mind to tarry there, but took my way streight to St. <HI>Luear,</HI> and sailed along the River, with a great many other Persons for Company in a Boat.</P>
<P>We arrived in the Night-time at St. <HI>Lucar,</HI> and I went to lodge with my former Host, who was called <HI>Ba∣stanuil Biscain.</HI> I continued there for some Days to wait for an Occasion to embark: But my bad Fortune would have it so, that the Vessels which were then in the Port, durst not ven∣ture out, because they had Advice, that from <HI>Argier,</HI> and other Places of <HI>Barbary,</HI> were put out to Sea near Fifty Vessels, who guarded the Coasts,
<PB N="333" REF="47"/>
and were separated 10, 15, and 20 Ships, towards each Height and Cape, where they thought they were to pass; so that they took all they could meet with.</P>
<P>Seeing my self thus retained, and without much Commodities to live by, having already spent the most part of what I had, I was constrained, in expectation of better Conveniency, to place my self with an Apothecary of St. <HI>Lucar,</HI> who made me promise to serve him for some time. But as Fortune never left Persecuting of me, so this poor Man returning one Night from Supper in the City, was arrested Prisoner by the Command of the Duke of <HI>Medina Sidonia;</HI> and after that, the Justice came to his House and seized up∣on all his Papers, where the Alg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aziles, or Sergeants made a strange Ravage. They accused him for having made some Libel against the Duke. I spent this Night with no small Trouble and Uneasiness.</P>
<P>The next Day I went again into the Fields to go towards the Port <HI>St. Mary,</HI> where I made so much hast, after having passed many Places by
<PB N="334" REF="48"/>
Water, and bad way, that I arrived there at Night in Company of a Re∣ligious <HI>Jacobin,</HI> who shewed me a great deal of Courtesie, and caused me to lodge with him in the House of a Muleteer. The Day following, I took the way of <HI>Xerez de la Frontera,</HI> and had no small Trouble before I could come there, for the great Abun∣dance of Waters which I found by the way. At last, having escaped them as well as I could, and being ve∣ry weak in regard of the great Hun∣ger I endured, by good Fortune I met with two Men in sight of <HI>Xerez,</HI> who courteously invited me to eat with them; and being sate down to eat, they fell to discoursing of several Things, and amongst others, came upon my Subject, speaking of Hun∣ger, and that it is the most easie to be supported, when one stirs not from a Place without doing any thing, or when one is at Work, and thinks of doing some other thing: At last one of them concluded, that he was sen∣sible of more Hunger when he was doing nothing, than when he was at work, and found that there was some
<PB N="335" REF="48"/>
reason for it, in regard that Action diverts the Thoughts: And I remem∣bred that I heard reported, how that the several sorts of Plays, as Cards, Dice, Tables, and others, were at first invented to amuse Men during a great Scarcity of Victuals, and by this means to divert them from thinking upon their Hunger. And therefore 'tis said, That <HI>Drake,</HI> that samous <HI>English</HI> Captain, returning home from his great Voyage about the World, (which he had encompassed,) one Day, as he found himself in great necessity of Victuals, and saw his Men ready to starve with Hunger, he caused them to play to divert themselves; and when they were thirsty, he advi∣sed them to sleep to refresh themselves. This Scarcity was so great, as I have heard some <HI>English</HI> say, That they were forced to eat some Blacks which they had brought along with them, and having found near <HI>England</HI> a Ves∣sel loaded with Victuals, they eat so much thereof, that the most part of them died by over charging them∣selves.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="49"/>
But to return to <HI>Xerez:</HI> Being arri∣ved <NOTE PLACE="marg">Xerez.</NOTE> there, tho' not without abundance of trouble, passing through the Ci∣ty▪ I by chance found my self near the Shop of an Apothecary, where there was some Surgions discoursing together. When they saw me, they cast out some Words of Mocking, be∣cause of my Garb, <HI>à la Francois:</HI> But I returning towards them, told them a few Words of Chirurgery in <HI>Latin;</HI> which they being ignorant of they knew not what to answer, except by naming to me, to surprize me, a cer∣tain Composition called <HI>Hieralogod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i;</HI> but I asked them, if they knew not whether it was <HI>Hierapachii?</HI> which is one and the same thing; at which they were put to a <HI>Nonplus.</HI> And thus I left them there, and kept on my way, and by good Fortune met in this City with a <HI>French</HI> Man, a <HI>Britan,</HI> who lived with a Cavalier, and took me along with him, where he made as much of me as he could. There I found a <HI>Persian</HI> Slave, who hearing me speak of his Country, and the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> was so overjoy'd, that he called me his Kinsman, and made
<PB N="337" REF="49"/>
me as good Chear as he could in this House, where he had much Credit.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Zerez</HI> is situated on high in a very pleasant Country, as all the rest of the Province of <HI>Anda∣lousia,</HI> and is not far from the little River <HI>Ovadal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> famous for the great Battel fought there, where <HI>Roderick</HI> the last King of <HI>Spain</HI> lost his Life, with all his Nobility, at which time the <HI>Moors</HI> render'd themselves Masters of all <HI>Spain.</HI> The Soil is very fertile in Corn, Wines, Oil, and all sorts of Fruit, and produces also those excel∣lent Horses call'd Gennets.</P>
<P>When I was there, I was told how that the Judge of that Place, whom the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had established there, not having a mind to do a piece of Injustice, as the Gentlemen and Hidalgo's of the City desired him, they had invited him to a Supper, with an Intention to put an Affront upon him; but he doubting of their Ill-will, would not go to them: At which they being vexed, made his Image, and burnt it in a Fire before his own Door in a Bravado; and in the mean
<PB N="338" REF="50"/>
time, he not daring to stir out of his House, which was as it were besieged by them. Upon which, his Wife went strait to Court, to make her Complaint to the King, and to de∣mand Justice of him, which was granted her: For the King of <HI>Spain</HI> commanded these insolent Hidalgo's, or Gentlemen, to come before him, and ordered their Process to be drawn immediately, and condemned them every one to have their Heads chopp'd off. But when they said for Excuse, that they were drunk when they put this Affront upon the Judge, they were pardon'd, and had his Grace, except Two Brothers, who never would confess themselves to be drunk when they play'd this Prank, and were so glorious, that they chose ra∣ther to have their Heads cut off, than to confess the same, as the rest had done. And hereupon came the Pro∣verb, That <HI>Los Hidalgos di Xerez Son Borrachos,</HI> The Gentlemen of <HI>Xerez</HI> are Drunkards.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="50"/>
After having tarried some Days at <HI>Xerez,</HI> I returned to the Port St. <HI>Mary,</HI> expecting to find an occa∣sion for my Embarkment: But be∣ing there, I could not by my utmost Endeavour, procure License to pass to the <HI>Indies,</HI> in regard of the rigorous Injunction not to suffer any Strangers to go to the <HI>Indies,</HI> but especially the <HI>French;</HI> yet if I had had Money to give, perhaps I might have had this Permission; but I had not so much as a Maravedis, nor Hopes to meet with any there, besides that I found my self somewhat indispos'd. All this, with the bad Entertainment which I receiv'd amongst these People so Un∣charitable and Discourteous, gave me cause to desire my Return, and thought to embark my self in some <HI>Aulonno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Ships, to return with them to <HI>France;</HI> and indeed I gathered together some rare Plants, which I put into a Vessel, with some other things, of which I never since could hear any notice, but that they had cast all into the Sea. In the mean time I wondred why this Ship did not set sail, but she was hin∣dred
<PB N="340" REF="51"/>
by the Decrease of the Moon; for the Sea does so follow the course of this changing Planet, that it is ta∣ken notice, that the Ebbing and Flow∣ing is in the heighth, when the Moon is in Conjunction.</P>
<P>This Ship of <HI>Aulonne</HI> which I wait∣ed for, was called the <HI>Gift of God,</HI> and belonged to one <HI>Peter Bled:</HI> In the mean time the Vessel departed without taking me in, and I remain'd there in no small trouble and misery; and had no other Recourse, but to put my self into a Boat which I found go∣ing to <HI>Calix,</HI> not far from thence; and nevertheless we had no small Trouble in our Passage, because of the contrary Winds. We at last went on shoar in a desart Place, about a League from <HI>Calix,</HI> to which Place I went on foot along by the shore: I there found Acquaintance, but I could not stay there long, because the City was filled with Soldiers belonging to the Army of <HI>Dom Lous de Fajardo,</HI> Admiral of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, who was just returned from <HI>Mamorre,</HI> which he had taken from the <HI>Moors,</HI> and
<PB N="341" REF="51"/>
had there found a great Number of Pyrates, of whom some he had hang∣ed, and put the rest to the Oar; the rest were partly sunk, and some burnt themselves in despair, rather than thoy would yield.</P>
<P>This Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of <HI>Calix,</HI> or <HI>Cadis,</HI> was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Calix.</NOTE> the <HI>Gades</HI> so famous in ancient times, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gadis.</NOTE> where 'tis said that <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcules,</HI> after ha∣ving overcome the <HI>Gerions,</HI> planted his memorable Pillars, as being the end and utmost Bounds of Naviga∣tion at that time; but since, in these last Ages, the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtugals</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have happily found the <HI>Plus Ʋltra,</HI> which has given them Passage at their Pleasure through all the Orient and Occident. These <HI>Gad tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an</HI> Pillars were upon the Two Mountains <HI>Aby∣la</HI> and <HI>Calpe,</HI> placed upon the Extre∣mities of the <HI>Straights,</HI> one in <HI>Afri∣ca,</HI> and the other in <HI>Europe</HI> side, now <HI>Ceuta</HI> and <HI>Algezira;</HI> or else the true <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceuta.</NOTE> Pillars compos'd of Tin, Gold, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Algezira.</NOTE> Silver mixed together, which were by <HI>Hercules</HI> put into the Temple of the <HI>Parques,</HI> and afterwards in the Tem∣ple <NOTE PLACE="marg">Parques.</NOTE> dedicated to him in the City of
<PB N="342" REF="52"/>
<HI>Gades.</HI> This Straight has since been called <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> or <HI>Gabel-Tarif,</HI> which signifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Mount of <HI>Tarif,</HI> in Memory of that Renowned Captain who commanded in Chief in the <HI>Sa∣raz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> War, which began the Con∣quest of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Gades</HI> in ancient times was not very Populous, and is at this Day a little City, celebrated for the Salt-pits, and Almadraves, or the Fi∣shing for the Tonny. This was for∣merly an Isle distant above 700 Paces from the main Land; but at present there is only a little Causey which se∣parates it therefrom.</P>
<P>Seeing then that I could not conve∣niently tarry at <HI>Calix,</HI> I went into the Fields towards an old ruined Tow∣er, which they call the <HI>Tower of Her∣cules,</HI> not far distant from the <HI>Straights.</HI> I found there some rare Plants, which I loaded my self withal, and saw this Tower, into which I entred, though not without a great deal of trouble, because the Sea beats against it; and besides, there came such a furious Wave, that I thought it would have
<PB N="343" REF="52"/>
carried me away. This Building is so well wrought, and appears so en∣tire, that it seems not to have been 20 Years since it was built. Now, as I was amongst these Ruines, I saw a great Wolf approach towards me, which I thought at first to be an Ass; but after having known what it was, I kept my self still, and let it pass a∣long by me, without stirring a Foot, for I saw that it was looking for Food. Not far from these Ruines I found a Temple, where I enter'd, and it look∣ed like an Azoy, or Mosque, after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner; yet there is an Altar set up, where sometimes they say Mass.</P>
<P>As I was returning towards <HI>Calix,</HI> I found the Sea mightily risen, so that I was a little wet in repassing the same; and had I stayed but a little longer, I had had a bad Nights Lodg∣ing there: At last I passed over, and found in my way a good old Man, who discoursed a great while with me about all these Antiquities; and how that in those Days there was more Men morally Good than now, though they
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="346" REF="53"/>
and from thence I came to a Place na∣med <HI>Chipione,</HI> where having gotten some Money by certain Cures, I re∣turned to San <HI>Lucar,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Sevillia,</HI> where I was forced to con∣tinue for some time and joined my self with a certain Apothecary, who lived in the <HI>Triane,</HI> or on the other side of the Bridge. This <HI>Triane</HI> is a Suburb on the other side the River of <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣quiver,</HI> which hath a Castle, where is the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> or <HI>Holy-Office,</HI> as they call it. This Apothecary made Pro∣fession of Christianity, but was held for a Jew, as he made it appear to me; for he treated me but scurvily, not∣withstanding the Service that I did him in his <HI>Alquitarres,</HI> or <HI>Limb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks.</HI> I endured a great deal of Hardship with him, and became extream sick with a Vom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, and a Bloody-flux, so that I thought I should have died, and had no small trouble to recover my self; never receiving Help from this <HI>Jew,</HI> or any of his.</P>
<P>Whilst I was there, I remember that they of the Parish of St. <HI>Ann,</HI> or the Suburb of <HI>Triane,</HI> made a Pro∣cession on <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> in the Even∣ing,
<PB N="347" REF="53"/>
carrying all lighted Wax-Candles, and sung a Hymn in Honour of the Blessed Virgin, to shew that she was conceived without Original Sin; to which they applied the Words of the Royal Psalmist, <HI>Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei; &amp; in sole posuit tabernaculum su∣um,</HI> &amp;c. and other such-like things. And hereupon the whole City of <HI>Se∣ville</HI> was in an Uproar, and there were some Priests themselves put into the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> because they had the Bold∣ness to maintain, that the Virgin was conceiv'd in Sin; insomuch that there was likely to be a great Tumult; and my <HI>Jew</HI> was then in such fear, that he durst scarcely stir out of his House, though he was of this same Parish. There was some, who either out of Fear, or Devotion, wore, writ upon their Hatbands in great Letters, these Words, <HI>Sin pecado Original voto a tal:</HI> to shew that they believed, or would have others believe. At the same time they caused to be out before the great Church in <HI>Seville,</HI> upon a Mar∣ble-Table, in golden Letters, <HI>Concebi∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sin pecado Original.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="54"/>
Leaving then my Apothecary, still sick as I was, having found some Friends who lent me Money, I returned towards <HI>San Lucar,</HI> in Hopes to find Means to embark my self, not for the <HI>Indies,</HI> (of which I had lost all Hopes,) but to return into <HI>France:</HI> But as my bad Fortune would have it, not far from <HI>San Lucar</HI> I was Robbed in the Pinars; and coming to <HI>San Lucar,</HI> I soon found out who it was that had robbed me, but I du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st scarce speak thereof for fear of worse; besides there, as in other Places, Justice is ve∣ry difficult to be had without Money. At last, having found an Opportunity to go for <HI>France,</HI> we parted, (Ten <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Return in∣to</HI> France.</NOTE> Ships we were in Consort, and held our course far out in the Sea, for fear of the Ships of <HI>Tunis:</HI> The Ship wherein I was, was of <HI>Incuse</HI> in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> and the Captain was named <HI>Jan Taye.</HI></P>
<P>Now one Day, when it was a great Calm, this Captain invited on board his Ship the Admiral, and Vice-Admi∣ral, with other Captains, who had treated him before: And after having made good Cheer together, and drunk
<PB N="349" REF="54"/>
plentifully of these <HI>Spanish</HI> Wines, they withdrew themselves each one on board his own Ship. In the mean time the Wind began to rise, and we were forced to change the Sails; but all the Mariners, and the Pilot him∣self, were so drunk, that they knew not what they did: When he who was at the Helm commanded to set to the Larboard, they hal'd to the Starboard, having the Wind in their Faces; one cried this way, another that way, it being the greatest Confusion in the World, not one understanding what another said. When I saw that, I took the Helm my self, and brought the Ship fairly before the Wind; then came a <HI>French</HI> Mariner, who was just come out of Captivity from <HI>Barbary,</HI> and had not drank so much as the rest. I quitted the Bar to him, because I was bid to beware of the Captain, who was in a great Rage against me<HI>:</HI> Nevertheless that hindred me not from going to find him out upon the Deck, where he was still emptying some Bot∣tles of Wine with his Mariners. As soon as he saw me, he began to mut∣ter something to himself; whereupon
<PB N="350" REF="55"/>
I took up a Cup and drank to him, which pacified him a little, and told me that he was very angry with me; and having asked him the Cause, he shewed me his Arm, scarce being a∣ble to speak, meaning to tell me that I had never a Lancet to let Blood. Hereupon I doubted that a wicked <HI>Norman</HI> had told him of that; for in parting from <HI>San Lucar</HI> I had told him how I had been Robb'd, yet I had made Provision of Medicines to cure the Sick when there should be occa∣sion; and I had cured the Captain's own Brother of a certain Pain that he had in his Legs, which was no small Help to me; for ever since that time he was always my Friend against those who had a mind to do me any wrong, and especially this <HI>Norman,</HI> who made it his chief Business to ex∣asperate these People against me, to the end that they might do me Mis∣chief; but God preserved me from them. The next Day they took a poor Boy, a <HI>Fleming,</HI> who was a Pas∣senger, and tied him fast to the great Sail-yard, to duck him into the Sea, because, as they said, he had been
<PB N="351" REF="55"/>
drunk, and had spoiled the Deck<HI>:</HI> He was thus hoised up Three times by the Sail-yard, and so duck'd in the Sea, after the Captain had first drank to him, which he pledged. 'Twas a great Pity to hear the Cries and Com∣plaints of this poor Boy, and I was not able to behold a Spectacle so cruel, but withdrew my self below Deck, where in the mean time I heard them murmuring against me, at the Inspi∣ration of this <HI>Norman,</HI> who had been Captain of a Ship in the New-found Lands, and was now a Passenger in this Vessel, having more store of Crowns than Good-nature.</P>
<P>After having sailed thus for some time, we arrived happily, by the Grace of God, at the <HI>Havre,</HI> the 15th. Day <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arrival at</HI> Paris.</NOTE> of <HI>August,</HI> 1615. and from thence I went straight to <HI>Paris,</HI> which was the Term of all my Voyages, and of this last Peregrination, which was more troublesome and incommodious than long. But God be praised for all, to whom I render infinite Thanks that it hath pleased his Divine Goodness to preserve me from my Infancy to this time, from so many several Misfortunes
<PB N="352" REF="56"/>
and Difficulties which I have met withal: For I was but at my Mother's Breasts in the Year 1576. when my Fa∣ther was Imprisoned at <HI>Meaux</HI> for being Surety for a Debt, which he was obliged to pay; and whilst he had Permission to provide accordingly, it behoved my Mother to supply his Place in the Pri∣son with me; and thus began I be∣times to resent the Miseries of the World, which since in greater Age <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have experienc'd more fully, and more roughly, in regard of my almost-conti∣nual Absence from my native Country, in strange Lands, and remote Places, devoid of all Comfort, and exposed to all sorts of Miseries that could befall any Man; and moreover, since my Re∣turn into mine own native Country, I have not been exempted from the like Misfortunes and Calamities, having had but very little Support from Men, as∣sisted only by the Providence of my God, who hath never forsaken me, but hath caused the Afflictions which he hath pleased to send me, to be an Ob∣ject to several Persons of Honour to exercise towards me their Good and Laudable Charities.</P>
