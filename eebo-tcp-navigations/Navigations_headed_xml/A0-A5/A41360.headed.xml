<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND AND CITY OF CANDIA. By E. G. Serjeant at Arms.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
<P>This Table sheweth
wheareabout and how
this Iland Candia lyeth
betwixt Europe &amp; Asia
and the Venetian &amp; Turke</P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THE Commonweal of <HI>Venice,</HI> for the Greatness,
Nobility, Riches, goodly Pallaces, Scituation, and
other good parts, is admirable among all the
Towns of <HI>Europe;</HI> the scituation thereof being so
commodious for all things, as it may be held rather a Di∣vine
than a humane work. And although many Com∣monweals
have exceeded it in greatness of Empire, in
multitudes of people, and in state; yet there was never any
Town so strangely scituated nor so securely: But not to
detain you here, we shall proceed to give you a short ac∣count
of the Island of <HI>Creta</HI> or of <HI>Candia.</HI> The Island of
<HI>Creta</HI> (anciently so called, or of <HI>Candia,</HI> as we now call it)
hath in length, from East to West about sixty <HI>French</HI>
Leagues, and not above sixteen Leagues in breadth, it is
about a hundred and twenty Leagues in circuit, going about
by Sea: Upon the West it hath the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, to the
North that which carries the name of the <HI>Cretish</HI> Sea, to
the South the <HI>Lybick,</HI> and to the East the <HI>Carpathien,</HI> as <HI>Pto∣limey,</HI>
describes it. It was famous in old time for that it
had an hundred Towns, and therefore the Greek Poet called
it <HI>Hecatompolis:</HI> The scituation is more Easternly than that
of the Countrey of <HI>Morea,</HI> lying betwixt the Counties of
<HI>Artica</HI> and that of <HI>Cyren,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> being but two dayes
journey by Sea from either Province at this day, according
to <HI>Belonus:</HI> There are but three Towns of note in this
Island, that is, <HI>Candia</HI> (in old time <HI>Matium)</HI> the chief of
this Island, whereof it takes her name, then <HI>Canea</HI> some∣times
<HI>Sidon</HI> and <HI>Rhetinno;</HI> it hath a port which is not very
commodious, but those of <HI>Cania</HI> and <HI>Candia</HI> are very safe;
in this Island are the Rivers of <HI>Melipotame, Scasin, Cladile,
Episidome, Giffo,</HI> and <HI>Divotro,</HI> towards the North <HI>Populiar,</HI>
towards the West <HI>Lymans,</HI> and to the South the Moun∣tains
of note are <HI>Ida</HI> called by the inhabitants <HI>Philloriti
Luci,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Cadussi,</HI> and at this day <HI>Madure,</HI> and
<HI>Dacte,</HI> which they call <HI>Setrie.</HI> This Island seems to be
made to command all <HI>Greece,</HI> for that it lies not far from
<HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and may command all the Sea towards <HI>Greece,</HI>
it was sold to the <HI>Venetians</HI> by the Marquis of <HI>Montserrat</HI>
in the year, 1194.</P>
<P>This Island of <HI>Candia,</HI> although it be hilly, yet it hath
many Valleys that are fruitful, and yield much, for that
they are watered with many Fountains, Brooks, and Rivers:
Moreover, there is abundance of excellent Wine, which
they of the Countrey call <HI>Malmsey,</HI> they have store of Milk
and Honey, and sufficient of flesh, so as they anciently did
call it, the happy Island: There grows the goodliest Cy∣press
Trees that can be seen; and all other kinds of Timber
fit for the building of Ships. There is not any hurtful or
venemous Beasts except <HI>Phalanges,</HI> which are like unto Spi∣ders,
but in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andia</HI> they are not dangerous.</P>
<P>It abounds also in wild Goats, fallow Deer, and Ysards,
or <HI>Chamo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> but there are few wild Bores, unless it be about
<HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> there are also <HI>Bouceslains</HI> called by the Latines <HI>Ibex,</HI>
they have long Horns like unto a wild Goat, and are not
much bigger, yet they have as much flesh as a Stag, the hair
is fallow and short, but they carry a great black Beard; some∣times
they take them, when they are very little, to breed
them up amongst their troops of Goats, and to have of
their race, as well for their beauty as for the taste of their
flesh, his Horns are very great in respect of his Body, but
he is so nimble as he out-runs any Stag, neither can the dogs
follow him by the scent, for that he will wind the Huntsmen about a hundred paces off,
so as when they would take him, they tie tame Goats upon the passages of the Mountain,
were the <HI>Bouceslaine</HI> smelling them, he goes unto them, and staying there, the Huntsmen
have opportunity to strike him, but if the wound be not mortal, although the Dart be poy∣son'd
and remains in his Body, yet he cures himself eating the Herb, which the Simplist calls
<HI>Dixamum,</HI> the which is good against poison, as <HI>Dioscordies</HI> saith, for that the only scent of it
kills Serpents and other venomous Beasts.</P>
<P>This Island did flourish in former times, when as her King did hold all <HI>Greece</HI> in awe, the
<HI>Cretoies</HI> were held the best Archers in the World, they invented the Pyrick Daunce, in the
time of their King <HI>Cydon,</HI> they were all armed when as they danced, and it hath been so con∣tinued
in this Island, as the Pesants daunce on Holy-dayes in the hottest time of Summer,
not caring for any shadow, and with their Arms, that is to say, a Bow, a Sheaf of Arrows,
and a Sword, as if without it they could have no good grace in dancing: The most famous
Nations among the Grecians have taken their Laws from the Candiots, as <HI>Plato</HI> doth wit∣ness,
especially the <HI>Laced<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>monians,</HI> took their practice from them, they had one which did in∣joyn
that all their children should be bred up in publick, to the end that the poor having the
like breeding to the rich, they shall have no cause to envy them. And it was also ordained by the
Laws, that to inure their children not to fear any thing, but to bear all things with patience,
they should be accustomed to Arms; and to make them contemn heat, cold, hunger, and
thirst, they should carry a Bow and Arrows in dancing, and their apparel should be sit for
War, all the Candiots were forced to marry, being of age, and then they were dismiss'd
from the company of young men: they did not presently conduct their Wives home to their
Houses, but they attended until they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to manage the affairs of a Houshold, and Kins∣folks
married indifferently one with another. There was a Law, that if the brother did mar∣ry
his sister, he should make her a Dowry of half his Patrimony: To ravish a Maid was more
esteemed, than if he had obtained his desire with free consent. In the end, Candiots lea∣ving
their ancient Discipline, became Pirats, having been always powerful at Sea, and had
carried themselves so valiantly, as they had vanquished them of <HI>Attica,</HI> and led Arms fortu∣nately
into <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Candia</HI> are by nature apt and ready to do evil: the Ancients give them
the title of Lyers: They are subtil and courteous, and do hardly endure labour, neither do
they learn any Art or Science perfectly: It is true, that at this day, as <HI>Belonus</HI> saith, they do
practice from their Youth, according to their ancient custom, to shoot, wherein they excel
even the Turks themselves, and they are active and valiant at Sea, as much as they have been
in former times.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Candia</HI> is exceeding strong, both by Art and Scituation; The Turks being
possest of the whole Island and Master of the field, attempted to win the <HI>Metropolis Candia</HI> also.
Therefore <HI>Anno</HI> 1648. he besieged it, and after many furi∣ous
onsets, being still beaten, at last he was forced to give
over, but raised another Town or new <HI>Candia</HI> at three
miles distance, which is the place of the Grand Visiers
Residence, by which means the City is blockt up by Land;
and now again the last year 1667. and this present 1668.
he lyeth before it, using all the extremities possible to win
it, and that he might the better effect it, the grand Visier
has demolished the afore mentioned Town that they built,
called new <HI>Candia,</HI> that so his Souldiers might be the
more resolute in the siege, having no place for their re∣treat.</P>
<P>This <HI>Candia</HI> is a large and famous City, scituated on a
Plain by the Sea side, having a goodly Haven for Ships,
and a fair Arsenal with 36. Gallies, it is very populous
and rich, inhabited partly by <HI>Venetians,</HI> and partly by the
natural <HI>Candians,</HI> it is exceeding strong, and in Peace∣time
daily guarded with 2000. Souldiers. The Women
wear breeches as men do, and boots after the same manner,
and their upper Coats no longer then the middle of their
Thighs; The better sort of people go after the <HI>Veneti∣an</HI>
fashion. <HI>Canea</HI> is the second City of this Realm, ex∣ceeding
populous, well walled and fortified, equallizing
any strength in <HI>Europe,</HI> it hath a large Castle, where a
<HI>Venetian</HI> Sub-Governour doth reside; Then is <HI>Retimo,</HI>
this hath no Wall but a Castle. The fourth is, <HI>Sithia</HI>
also head of a Province. The Island of it self is inacces∣sible
for ships, but in these four Cities, and some few
other places well gauarded to hinder it. The Prin∣cipal
Commodities of this Island, are the Excellent
Wines, especially the <HI>Maluasy,</HI> and the best Sugar in the
World, which we commonly call Sugar-Candy, then Cy∣press
wood, of which there are vast Mountains full, which
they use for all things, Joyners and Carpenters work,
Timber for buildings, Masts for Gallies, the rest for fuel.
As for variety &amp; plenty of all sorts of excellent rare fruits,
it doth surpass all other adjacent Islands, especially the
Valley of <HI>Suda,</HI> a second <HI>Paradise;</HI> the Grain is brought
from other parts; Of wild and hurtful beasts, as Lions,
Bears, Wolves, &amp;c. there is none; neither any venomous
Vermine, yet there is a sort of Serpents, but their sting
not hurtful, on the contrary their women are said to be so
venemous, that being angry, if they scratch or bite a man,
and setch bloud, without present remedy he must die. The
Natives are of the Grecian Church, except the <HI>Venetians</HI>
and strangers.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1645. The Turk unepectedly in Peace-time pick∣ing
quarrel, landed 60000 men, and presently besieged <HI>Ca∣nea,</HI>
and before the <HI>Venetians</HI> could provide for defence,
he took that, and the whole Island, except the City of
<HI>Candia,</HI> two or three other Forts, among whose is that of
<HI>Suda,</HI> whose Haven or Bay may receive at once above tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thousand Ships and Gallies, the rest is all lost.</P>
