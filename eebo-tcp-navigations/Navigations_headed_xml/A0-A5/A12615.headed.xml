<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, THE Right Worshipfull Counsellors, and others the cheerefull aduenturors for the aduancement of that Christian and noble plantation in VIRGINIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His worke, right Honourable, right Wor∣shipfull, and the rest, though small in shew, yet great in substance, doth yeeld much light to our enterprise now on foot: whether you desire to know the present and future commodities of our countrie; or the qualities and conditions of the Inhabitants, or what course is best to be taken with them.</P>
<P>Touching the commodities, besides the generall report of <HI>Cabeça de Vaca</HI> to <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour (who first tra∣uelled through a great part of the Inland of <HI>Florida,</HI> next adioyning vpon our <HI>Virginia) That</HI> Florida <HI>was the ri∣chest countrie of the world; and, that after hee had found clothes made of cotton wooll,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 35.</NOTE> <HI>he saw gold and siluer, and stones of great value:</HI> I referre you first to the rich mines of gold reported to be in the prouince of <HI>Yupaha,</HI> and described in the twelfth Chapter of this Treatise to come within our limits: And againe, to the copper hatchets found in <HI>Cutifachiqui,</HI> standing vpon the Riuer of <HI>Santa Hele∣na,</HI>
<PB REF="3"/> which were said to haue a mixture of gold. It seemeth also that the last Chronicler of the West Indies, <HI>Antonio de Herrera,</HI> speaking of the foresaid Riuer of <HI>Santa Helena,</HI> which standeth in <HI>32.</HI> degrees and an halfe, alludeth to the prouince of <HI>Yupaha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Decad. 3 lib. 8. cap. 8.</NOTE> in these words: <HI>Y el oro, y plata, que hallaron, no era de aquella tierra, sino de 60. leguas, adentro al norte, de los pueblos dichos</HI> Otapales <HI>y</HI> Ola∣gatanos, <HI>adonde se intiende, que ay minas de oro, plata, y cobre.</HI> That is to say, That the gold and siluer which they found, was not of that countrie (of <HI>Santa Helena</HI>) but <HI>60.</HI> leagues distant toward the North, of the townes called <HI>Ota∣pales</HI> and <HI>Olagatanos,</HI> where we vnderstand that there are mines of gold, siluer, and copper. By which reckoning these rich mines are in the latitude of <HI>35.</HI> degrees and an halfe. I desire you likewise to take knowledge of the famous golden prouince of <HI>Chisca,</HI> stretching further to the North, where∣of the Cacique of <HI>Coste</HI> gaue notice to <HI>Ferdinando de So∣to</HI> in the towne of <HI>Chiaha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 15.</NOTE> affirming, that there were mines of copper, and of another mettall of the same colour, saue that it was finer, and of a farre more perfect lustre, and farre bet∣ter in sight, and that they vsed it not so much, because it was softer. And the selfesame thing was before told the Gouernour in <HI>Cutifachiqui:</HI> who sent two Christians from <HI>Chiaha</HI> with certaine Indians which knew the countrie of <HI>Chisca,</HI> and the language thereof, to view it, and to make report of that which they should finde.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 23.</NOTE> We likewise reade not long af∣ter, that the Gouernour set forward to seeke a prouince called <HI>Pacaha,</HI> which hee was informed to be neere vnto <HI>Chisca,</HI> where the Indians told him, that there was gold. And in another place hee saith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 24.</NOTE> That from <HI>Pacaha</HI> hee sent thirtie horsemen and fiftie footmen to the prouince of <HI>Caluça,</HI> to see if from thence he might trauell to <HI>Chisca,</HI> where the Indians said, there was a worke of gold and copper. So that here is
<PB REF="3"/> foure times mention, and that in sundrie places, of the rich and famous goldē mines of <HI>Chisca,</HI> and that they lie beyond the mountaines toward the North, ouer which they were not able to trauell for the roughnes thereof. But what neede I to stand vpon forren testimonies, since Master <HI>Thomas He∣riot,</HI> a man of much iudgement in these causes, signified vn∣to you all, at your late solemne meeting at the house of the right honourable the Earle of Exeter, how to the Southwest of our old fort in <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Indians often informed him, that there was a great melting of red mettall, reporting the man∣ner in working of the same. Besides, our owne Indians haue lately reuealed either this or another rich mine of copper or gold in a towne called <HI>Ritanoe,</HI> neere certaine mountaines lying West of <HI>Roanoac.</HI></P>
<P>Another very gainfull commoditie is, the huge quantitie of excellent perles, and little babies and birds made of them, that were found in <HI>Cutifachiqui.</HI> The abundance whereof is reported to be such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 14.</NOTE> that if they would haue searched diuers graues in townes thereabout, they might haue laded many of their horses. Neither are the Turkie stones and cotton wooll found at <HI>Guasco</HI> to be forgotten, nor passed ouer in silence.</P>
<P>But that, which I make no small account of, is, the multi∣tude of Oxen, which, from the beginning of the <HI>16.</HI> to the end of the <HI>26.</HI> Chapter, are nine seuerall times made mention of, and that along from <HI>Chiaha, Coste, Pacaha, Coligoa,</HI> and <HI>Tulla,</HI> still toward the North, to wit, toward vs, there was such store of them, that they could keepe no corne for them: and that the Indians liued vpon their flesh. The haire of these Oxen is likewise said to be like a soft wooll, betweene the course and fine wooll of sheepe: and that they vse them for couerlets, because they are very soft and woolled like sheep: and not so onely, but they make bootes, shooes, targets, and other things necessarie of the same. Besides the former bene∣fits,
<PB REF="4"/> their young ones may be framed to the yoke, for carting and tillage of our ground. And I am in good hope, that ere it be long we shall haue notice of their being neerer vs, by that which I reade in the Italian relation of <HI>Cabeça de Vaca,</HI> the first finder of them; which writeth, <HI>That they spread themselues within the countrie aboue foure hundred leagues.</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reouer, <HI>Vasques de Coronado,</HI> and long af∣ter him, <HI>Antonio de Espejo</HI> (whose voiages are at large in my third volume) trauelled many leagues among these heards of Oxen, and found them from <HI>33.</HI> degrees ranging very farre to the North and Northeast.</P>
<P>A fourth chiefe commoditie wee may account to be the great number of Mulberrie trees, apt to feede Silke-wormes to make silke: whereof there was such plentie in many places, that, though they found some hempe in the countrie, the Spa∣niards made ropes of the barks of them for their brigandines, when they were to put to sea for <HI>Noua Hispania.</HI></P>
<P>A fifth is the excellent and perfect colours, as black, white, greene, yellow, and red, and the materials to dye withall, so often spoken of in this discourse: among which I haue some hope to bring you to the knowledge of the rich graine of Co∣chonillio, so much esteemed, and of so great price. I speake no∣thing of the seuerall sorts of passing good grapes for Wine and Raisons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 31. &amp; 32</NOTE>Neither is it the least benefit, that they found salt made by the Indians at <HI>Cayas,</HI> and in two places of the prouince of <HI>Aguacay:</HI> the manner also how the Inhabitants make it, is very well worth the obseruation.</P>
<P>One of the chiefest of all the rest may be the notice of the S uth Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 31. &amp; 32</NOTE> leading vs to <HI>Iapan</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> which I finde here twice to be spoken of. Whereof long since I haue written a discourse, which I thinke not fit to be made ouer common.</P>
<P>For closing vp this point, The distances of places, the qua∣lities
<PB REF="4"/> of the soiles, the situations of the regions, the diuersities and goodnesse of the fruits, the seuerall sorts of beasts, the va∣rietie of fowles, the difference betweene the Inhabitants of the mountaines and the plaines, and the riches of the Inland in comparison of the Seacoast, are iudicially set downe in the conclusion of this booke, whereunto for mine owne ease I re∣ferre you.</P>
<P>To come to the second generall head, which in the begin∣ning I proposed, concerning the manners and dispositions of the Inhabitants: among other things, I finde them here no∣ted to be very eloquent and well spoken, as the short Orations, interpreted by <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI> which liued twelue yeeres among them, make sufficient proofe. And the author, which was a gentleman of <HI>Eluas</HI> in <HI>Portugall,</HI> emploied in all the action, whose name is not set downe, speaking of the Cacique of <HI>Tul∣la,</HI> saith, that aswell this Cacique, as the others, and all those which came to the Gouernour on their behalfe, deliuered their message or speech in so good order, that no Oratour could vtter the same more eloquently. But for all their faire and cunning speeches, they are not ouermuch to be trusted: for they be the greatest traitors of the world, as their mani∣fold most craftie contriued and bloody treasons, here set down at large, doe euidently proue. They be also as vnconstant as the wethercock, and most readie to take all occasions of aduan∣tages to doe mischiefe. They are great liars and dissemblers; for which faults often times they had their deserued pai∣ments. And many times they gaue good testimonie of their great valour and resolution. To handle them gently, while gentle courses may be found to serue, it will be without com∣parison the best: but if gentle polishing will not serue, then we shall not want hammerours and rough masons enow, I meane our old soldiours trained vp in the Netherlands, to square and prepare them to our Preachers hands. To con∣clude,
<PB REF="5"/> I trust by your Honours and Worships wise instructions to the noble Gouernour, the worthy experimented Lieutenant and Admirall, and other chiefe managers of the businesse, all things shall be so prudently carried, that the painfull Prea∣chers shall be reuerenced and cherished, the valiant and for∣ward soldiour respected, the diligent rewarded, the coward emboldened, the weake and sick relieued, the mutinous sup∣pressed, the reputation of the Christians among the Saluages preserued, our most holy faith exalted, all Paganisme and Ido∣latrie by little and little vtterly extinguished. And here re∣posing and resting my selfe vpon this sweete hope, I cease, be∣seeching the Almightie to blesse this good work in your hands to the honour and glorie of his most holy name, to the inlarge∣ment of the dominions of his sacred Maiestie, and to the generall good of all the worthie Aduenturers and vndertakers.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Aptaine <HI>Soto</HI> was the son of a Squire of <HI>Xerez</HI> of <HI>Badaioz.</HI> He went into the Spanish <HI>Indies,</HI> when <HI>Peter Arias</HI> of <HI>Auila</HI> was Gouernour of the West <HI>Indies:</HI> And there he was without any thing else of his owne, saue his sword and target: and for his good qualities and valour, <HI>Peter Arias</HI> made him Captaine of a troope of horsemen, and by his commandement hee went with <HI>Fernando Pizarro</HI> to the conquest of <HI>Peru:</HI> where (as many persons of credit reported, which were there present) as well at the taking of <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> Lord of <HI>Peru,</HI> as at the assault of the citie of <HI>Cusco,</HI> and in
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> all other places where they found resistance, where∣soeuer hee was present, hee passed all other Captaines and principall persons. For which cause, besides his part of the treasure of <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> he had a good share: whereby in time he gathered an hundred and foure∣score thousand Duckets together, with that which fell to his part: which he brought into <HI>Spaine:</HI> whereof the Emperour borrowed a certaine part, which he repaied againe with 60000 Rials of plate in the rent of the silkes of <HI>Granada,</HI> and all the rest was deliuered him in the Contractation house of <HI>Siuil.</HI> He tooke seruants, to wit, a Steward, a Gentleman Vsher, Pages, a Gentle∣man of the Horse, a Chamberlaine, Lakies, and al other officers that the house of a Noble mā requireth.

Hee married with <HI>Donna Isabella de Bouadilla,</HI> daughter of <HI>Peter Ari∣as</HI> of <HI>Auila,</HI> Earle of <HI>Punno en Rostro.</HI> The Emperour made him the Gouernor of the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and Ade∣lantado or President of <HI>Florida;</HI> with a title of Mar∣ques of certaine part of the lands, that he should con∣quer.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen <HI>Don Ferdinando</HI> had obtained the go∣uernment, there came a Gentleman from the <HI>Indies</HI> to the Court, named <HI>Cabeça de Vaca,</HI> which had been with the Gouernor <HI>Pamphilo de Naruaez</HI> which died in <HI>Florida,</HI> who repor∣ted that <HI>Naruaez</HI> was cast away at sea with all the com∣panie y<SUP>t</SUP> went with him. And how he with foure more escaped and arriued in <HI>Nueua Espanna:</HI> Also he brought a relation in writing of that which hee had seene in <HI>Florida;</HI> which said in some places: In such a place I haue seene this; and the rest which here I saw, I leaue to conferre of betweene his Maiestie and my selfe. Ge∣nerally he reported the miserie of the Countrie, and the troubles which hee passed: and hee told some of his kinsfolke, which were desirous to goe into the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> and vrged him very much to tell them whether he had seene any rich country in <HI>Florida,</HI> that he might not tell them, because hee and another, whose name was <HI>Orantes,</HI> (who remained in <HI>Nueua Espanna</HI> with purpose to returne into <HI>Florida:</HI> for which intent hee came into <HI>Spaine</HI> to beg the gouernment thereof of the Emperour) had sworne not to discouer some of those things which they had seene, because no man should preuent them in begging the same: And hee informed them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Florida is the richest Coun∣trie of the world.</NOTE> <HI>That it was the richest Countrie of the world. Don Ferdinando de Soto</HI> was very desirous to
<PB N="4" REF="7"/> haue him with him, and made him a fauourable offer: and after they were agreed, because <HI>Soto</HI> gaue him not a summe of money which he demanded to buy a ship, they broke off againe. <HI>Baltasar de Gallegos,</HI> and <HI>Christo∣pher de Spindola,</HI> the kinsemen of <HI>Cabeça de Vaca,</HI> told him, that for that which hee had imparted to them, they were resolued to passe with <HI>Soto</HI> into <HI>Florida,</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>efore they prayed him to aduise them what they were best to doe. <HI>Cabeça de Vaca</HI> told them, that the cause why he went not with <HI>Soto</HI> was, because hee ho∣ped to beg another gouernment, and that hee was loth to goe vnder the command of another: and that hee came to beg the conquest of <HI>Florida:</HI> but seeing <HI>Don Ferdinando de Soto</HI> had gotten it alreadie, for his othes sake hee might tell them nothing of that which they would know: but hee counselled them to sell their goods and goe with him, and that in so doing they should doe well. Assoone as he had opportunitie hee spake with the Emperour, and related vnto him what∣soeuer hee had passed and seene, and come to vnder∣stand. Of this relation made by word of mouth to the Emperour, the Marques of <HI>Astorga</HI> had notice, and forthwith determined to send with <HI>Don Ferdinando de Soto</HI> his brother <HI>Don Antonio Osorio:</HI> &amp; with him two kinsmen of his prepared themselues, to wit, <HI>Francis O∣sorio,</HI> and <HI>Garcia Osorio. Don Antonio</HI> dispossessed him∣selfe of 60000 Rials of rent which hee held by the Church: and <HI>Francis Osorio</HI> of a town of Vassals, which he had in the Countrie <HI>de Campos.</HI> And they made their Rendezuous with the Adelantado in <HI>Siuil.</HI> The like did <HI>Nunnez de Touar,</HI> and <HI>Lewis de Moscoso,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Rodriguez Lobillo,</HI> each of whō had brought from <HI>Peru</HI> fourteene or fifteene thousand Duckets. <HI>Lewis de
<PB N="5" REF="7"/> Moscoso</HI> carried with him two brethren: there went also <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> which had married the Gouernours Neece, and tooke her with him. From <HI>Badaioz</HI> there went <HI>Peter Calderan,</HI> and three kinsemen of the Ade∣lantado, to wit, <HI>Arias Tinoco, Alfonso Romo,</HI> and <HI>Diego Tinoco.</HI> And as <HI>Lewis de Moscoso</HI> passed through<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Eluas is a Ci∣tie in Portu∣gal.</NOTE> <HI>El∣uas, Andrew de Vasconcelos</HI> spake with him, and reque∣sted him to speake to <HI>Don Ferdinando de Soto</HI> concer∣ning him, and deliuered him certaine warrants which he had receiued from the Marques of <HI>Villa real,</HI> where∣in he gaue him the Captaineship of <HI>Ceuta</HI> in <HI>Barbarie,</HI> that he might shew them vnto him. And the Ade∣lantado saw them; and was informed who hee was, and wrote vnto him, that hee would fauour him in all things, and by al meanes, and would giue him a charge of men in <HI>Florida.</HI> And from <HI>Eluas</HI> went <HI>Andrew de Vasconcelos,</HI> and <HI>Fernan Pegado, Antonio Martinez Segu∣rado, Men Roiz Pereira, Iohn Cordero, Stephen Pegado, Be∣nedict Fernandez,</HI> and <HI>Aluaro Fernandez.</HI> And out of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> and <HI>Iaen,</HI> and <HI>Valencia,</HI> and <HI>Albuquerque,</HI> and from other partes of <HI>Spaine,</HI> many people of Noble birth assembled at <HI>Siuil:</HI> insomuch that in Saint <HI>Lucar</HI> many men of good account which had sold their goods remained behind for want of shipping, wheras for other known and rich Countries, they are wont to want men: and this fell out by occasion of that which <HI>Cabeça de Vaca</HI> told the Emperour, and informed such persons as hee had conference withall touching the State of that Countrie. <HI>Soto</HI> made him great offers: and being agreed to goe with him (as I haue said be∣fore) because he would not giue him monie to pay for a ship, which he had bought, they brake off, &amp; he went for Gouernour to the Riuer of <HI>Plate.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabeça de Vaca was the Gouernour of the Riuer of Plate.</NOTE> His kinsemen

<ARGUMENT>
<P> How this Christian came to the land of <HI>Florida,</HI> and who he was: and what conference he had with the Gouer∣nour.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Christians name was <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Ortiz, liued 12. yeeres, among the Floridi∣ans of Vcita and Mocoço</NOTE> and he was borne in <HI>Siuil,</HI> of worshipful paren∣tage. He was 12. yeeres in the hands of the Indians. He came into this Countrie with <HI>Pamphilo de Naruaez,</HI> and returned in the ships to the Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where the wife of the Gouernour <HI>Pam∣philo de Naruaez</HI> was: and by his commandement with 20. or 30. other in a brigandine returned backe againe to <HI>Florida:</HI> and comming to the port in the sight of
<PB N="22" REF="16"/> the towne, on the shore they saw a cane sticking in the ground, and riuen at the top, and a letter in it: and they beleeued that the Gouernour had left it there to giue aduertisement of himselfe, when he resolued to goe vp into the land: and they demanded it of foure or fiue Indians, which walked along the sea shore: and they bad them by signes to come on shore for it: which a∣gainst the will of the rest <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> and another did. And assoone as they were on land, from the houses of the towne issued a great number of Indians, which compassed them about, and tooke them in a place where they could not flee: and the other which sought to defend himselfe, they presentlie killed vpon the place, and tooke <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> aliue, and carried him to <HI>Vcita</HI> their Lord. And those of the brigandine sought not to land, but put themselues to sea, and returned to the Island of <HI>Cuba. Vcita</HI> commanded to bind <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> hand and foote vpon foure stakes aloft vpon a raft, and to make a fire vnder him, that there he might bee burned: But a daughter of his desired him that he would not put him to death, alleaging, that one only Christian could do him neither hurt nor good, telling him, that it was more for his honour to keepe him as a captiue. And <HI>Vcita</HI> granted her request, and comman∣ded him to be cured of his wounds: and assoone as he was whole, he gaue him the charge of the keeping of the Temple: because that by night the wolues did cary away the dead corpses out of the same: who com∣mended himselfe to God and tooke vpon him the charge of his temple. One night the wolues gate from him the corpes of a little child, the sonne of a principal Indian; and going after them he threw a darte at one of the wolues and strooke him that carried away the
<PB N="23" REF="16"/> corps, who feeling himselfe wounded, left it, and fell downe dead neere the place: and hee not woting what he had done, because it was night, went backe a∣gaine to the Temple: the morning being come, and finding not the bodie of the child, he was very sad. As∣soone as <HI>Vcita</HI> knew thereof, he resolued to put him to death; and sent by the tract, which he said the wolues went, and found the bodie of the child, and the wolfe dead a little beyond: whereat <HI>Vcita</HI> was much conten∣ted with the Christian, and with the watch which hee kept in the Temple, and from thence forward estee∣med him much. Three yeeres after hee fell into his hands, there came another Lord, called <HI>Mocoço,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mocoço dw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lleth two daies iournie from Vcita.</NOTE> who dwelleth two daies iourny from the Port, and burned his towne. <HI>Vcita</HI> fled to another towne that he had in another sea port. Thus <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> lost his office and fa∣uour that he had with him. These people being wor∣shippers of the diuell, are wont to offer vp vnto him the liues and blood of their Indians, or of any other people they can come by: and they report, that when he will haue them doe that sacrifice vnto him, he spea∣keth with them, and telleth them that he is athirst, and willeth them to sacrifice vnto him. <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> had no∣tice by the damsell that had deliuered him from y<SUP>e</SUP> fire, how her father was determined to sacrifice him y<SUP>e</SUP> day following, who willed him to flee to <HI>Mocoço:</HI> for shee knew y<SUP>t</SUP> he would vse him wel: for she heard say, that he had asked for him, and said hee would bee glad to see him: and because he knew not the way, she went with him halfe a league out of the towne by night, and set him in the way, &amp; returned, because she would not be discouered. <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> trauailed all that night, and by y<SUP>e</SUP> morning came vnto a Riuer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Riuer.</NOTE> which is in the territorie
<PB N="24" REF="17"/> of <HI>Mocoço:</HI> and there he saw two Indians fishing; and because they were in war with the people of <HI>Vcita,</HI> and their languages were different, and hee knew not the language of <HI>Mocoço,</HI> he was afraid, because he could not tell them who hee was, nor how hee came thither, nor was able to answer any thing for himselfe, that they would kill him, taking him for one of the Indians of <HI>Vcita,</HI> and before they espied him, he came to the place where they had laid their weapons: &amp; assoone as they saw him, they fled toward the towne, and although he willed thē to stay, because he meant to do thē no hurt, yet they vnderstood him not, and ran away as fast as e∣uer they could. And assone as they came to the towne with great outcries, many Indians came forth against him, and began to compasse him to shoote at him: <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> seeing himselfe in so great danger, sheilded him∣selfe with certaine trees, and began to shreeke out, and crie very loud, and to tell them that he was a Christian, and that he was fled from <HI>Vcita,</HI> and was come to see and serue <HI>Mocoço</HI> his Lord. It pleased God that at that very instant there came thither an Indian that could speake the language and vnderstood him; and pacifi∣ed the rest; who told them what hee said. Then ran from thence three or foure Indians to beare the newes to their Lord: who came foorth a quarter of a league from the towne to receiue him; and was very glad of him. He caused him presently to sweare according to the custome of the Christians, that hee would not run away from him to any other Lord: and promised him to entreate him very well; and that if at any time there came any Christians into that countrie, he would free∣ly let him goe, and giue him leaue to goe to them: and likewise tooke his oth to performe the same according
<PB N="25" REF="17"/> to the Indian custome. About three yeeres after cer∣taine Indians, which were fishing at sea two leagues from the towne, brought newes to <HI>Mocoço</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mocoço his towne within 2. leagues of the sea.</NOTE> that they had seene ships: and hee called <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI> and gaue him leaue to go his way: who taking his leaue of him, with all the haste he could came to the sea, and finding no ships, he thought it to be some deceit, and that the Cacique had done the same to learne his mind. So he dwelt with <HI>Mocoço</HI> nine yeeres, with small hope of see∣ing any Christians. Assoone as our Gouernor arriued in <HI>Florida,</HI> it was knowne to <HI>Mocoço,</HI> &amp; straightway he signified to <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI> that Christians were lodged in the towne of <HI>Vcita:</HI> And he thought he had iested with him, as hee had done before, and told him, that by this time he had forgotten the Christians, and thought of nothing else but to serue him. But he assured him that it was so, and gaue him licence to goe vnto them: say∣ing vnto him, that if hee would not doe it, and if the Christians should goe their way, he should not blame him, for hee had fulfilled that which he had promised him. The ioy of <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> was so great, that hee could not beleeue that it was true: notwithstanding he gaue him thankes, and tooke his leaue of him: and <HI>Mocoço</HI> gaue him tenne or eleuen principall Indians to beare him companie: and as they went to the port where the Gouernour was, they met with <HI>Baltasar de Gallègos,</HI> as I haue declared before. Assoone as he was come to the campe, the Gouernour commanded to giue him a sute of apparrell, and very good armour, and a faire horse; and enquired of him, whether hee had notice of any countrie, where there was any gold or siluer? He answered, No, because he neuer went ten leagues compasse from the place where he dwelt: But that
<PB N="26" REF="18"/> 30. leagues from thence dwelt an Indian Lord, which was called <HI>Parocossi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Paracossi 30. leagues from Puert de Spi¦rito Santo.</NOTE> to whom <HI>Mocoço</HI> and <HI>Vcita,</HI> with al the rest of that coast paied tribute, and that hee perad∣uenture might haue notice of some good countrie: and that his land was better then that of the sea coast, and more fruitfull and plentifull of maiz. Whereof the Gouernour receiued great contentment: and said that he desired no more then to finde victuals, that hee might goe into the maine land, for the land of <HI>Florida,</HI> was so large, that in one place or other there could not chuse but bee some rich Countrie. The <HI>Cacique Mo∣coço</HI> came to the Port to visit the Gouernor, and made this speech following.</P>
<P><HI>Right hie and mightie Lord, I being lesser in mine owne conceit for to obey you, then any of those which you haue vn∣der your command; and greater in desire to doe you greater seruices, doe appeare before your Lordship with so much confi∣dence of receiuing fauour, as if in effect this my good will were manifested vnto you in workes: not for the small seruice I did vnto you touching the Christian which I had in my power, in giuing him freely his libertie, (For I was bound to doe it to preserue mine honour, and that which I had promi∣sed him:) but because it is the part of great men to vse great magnificences: And I am perswaded, that as in bodily per∣fections, and commanding of good people, you doe exceede all men in the world, so likewise you doe in the parts of the minde, in which you may boast of the bountie of nature. The fauour which I hope for of your Lordship is, that you would hold mee for yours, and bethinke your selfe to command me any thing, wherein I may doe you seruice.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour answered him, That although in freeing and sending him the Christian, he had preser∣ued his honour and promise, yet he thanked him, and
<PB N="27" REF="18"/> held it in such esteeme, as it had no comparison; and that hee would alwaies hold him as his brother, and would fauour him in all things to the vtmost of his power. Then he commanded a shirt to be giuen him, and other things, wherewith the Cacique being verie well contented, tooke his leaue of him, and departed to his owne towne.</P>

<P><HI>Baltasar de Gallegos</HI> said vnto him, that hee thanked them very much for their offer, willing them to warne their Lord to come to his towne, and that there they would talke and confirme their peace and friendship, which he much desired. The Indians went their way, and returned the next day, and said, that their Lord was ill at ease, and therefore could not come, but that they came on his behalfe to see what he demanded. He as∣ked them if they knew or had notice of any rich Coun∣trie where there was gold or siluer. They told them, they did: and that toward the West, there was a Pro∣uince which was called <HI>Cale;</HI> and that others that in∣habited other Countries had warre with the people of that Countrie, where the most part of the yeere was sommer, and that there was much gold: and that when those their enemies came to make warre with them of <HI>Cale,</HI> these inhabitants of <HI>Cale</HI> did weare hats of gold, in manner of head peeces. <HI>Baltasar de Gallegos,</HI> seeing that the Cacique came not, thinking all that they said was fained, with intent that in the meane time they might set themselues in safetie, fearing, that if he did let them goe, they would returne no more, commanded the thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty Indians to be chained, and sent word to the Go∣uern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, by eight horsemen, what had passed: whereof the Gouernour with al that were with him, at the Port

He tooke three Indians which were spies, and tar∣ried there for his people that came after, which were sore vexed with hunger and euill waies, because the Countrie was very barren of Maiz, low, and full of wa∣ter, bogs, and thicke woods; and the victuals, which they brought with them from the Port <HI>de Spirito Santo,</HI> were spent. Wheresoeuer any towne was found, there were some beetes, and hee that came first gathered them, and sodden with water and salt, did eate them

After all the people were come together, hee

Hee departed from <HI>Caliquen</HI> the 10. of September, and carried the Cacique with him. After hee had trauelled three daies, there came Indians peaceably, to visit their Lord, and euery day met vs on the way playing vpon flutes: which is a to∣ken that they vse, that men may know that they come in peace. They said, that in our way before there was a Cacique, whose name was <HI>Vzachil,</HI> a kinseman of the Cacique of <HI>Caliquen</HI> their Lord, waiting for him with many presents, and they desired the Gouernor that he would loose the Cacique. But he would not, fearing that they would rise, and would not giue him any guides, &amp; sent them away from day to day with good words. He trauelled fiue daies, he passed by some smal townes, he came to a towne called <HI>Napetuca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some small townes. Napetuca.</NOTE> the 15. day of September.

The day that it was agreed vpon, the Go∣uernour commanded his men to bee in a readines, and that the horsemen should bee readie armed and on horsebacke euery one in his lodging, because the Indi∣ans might not see them, and so more confidently come to the towne.

There were 30. or 40. Indians slaine. The rest fled to two very great lakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two very great lakes.</NOTE> that were somewhat distant the one from the other: There they were swimming, and the Christians round about them. The calieuermen and crossebowmen shot at them from the banke; but the distance being great, and shooting afarre off, they did them no hurt. The Gouernour commanded that the same night they should compasse one of the lakes, because they were so great, that there were not mē enow to compasse them both: being beset, assoone as night shut in, the Indians, with determination to runne away, came swimming very softly to the banke; and to hide themselues, they put a water lillie leafe on their heads. The horsemen as∣soone as they perceiued it to stirre, ran into the water to the horses breasts, and the Indians fled againe into the lake. So this night passed without any rest on both sides. <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> perswaded them, that seeing they could not escape, they should yeeld themselues to the Gouernour: which they did, enforced thereunto by the coldnes of the water; and one by one, hee first whom the cold did first ouercome, cried to <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siring that they would not kill him, for he came to put himselfe into the hands of the Gouernour.

And the Indians of <HI>Para∣cossi,</HI> which were now loosed out of chaines, went swimming to them, and pulled them out by the haire of their heads, and they were all put in chaines; and the next day were diuided among the Christians for their seruice. Being thus in captiuitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new con∣spiracie.</NOTE> they determi∣ned to rebell; and gaue in charge to an Indian, which was interpretour, and held to be valiant, that assoone as the Gouernour did come to speake with him, hee should cast his hands about his necke, and choke him: Who, whē he saw opportunitie, laid hands on the Go∣uernour, and before he cast his hands about his necke, he gaue him such a blow on the nostrils, that hee made them gush out with blood, and presently all the rest did rise. He that could get any weapons at hand, or the handle wherewith he did grind the Maiz, sought to kill his master, or the first hee met before him: and hee that could get a lance or sword at hand, bestirred himselfe in such sort with it, as though he had vsed it all his life time. One Indian in the market place enclo∣sed betweene 15. or 20. footemen, made a way like a bull with a sword in his hand, till certaine halbardiers of the Gouernour came, which killed him. Another gat vp with a lance to a loft made of canes, which they build to keepe their Maiz in, which they call a Barba∣coa, and there hee made such a noise, as though tenne men had been there defending the doore: they slew him with a partisan.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Gouernour departed from <HI>Napetuca</HI> the 23. of September: he lodged by a Ri∣uer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Riuer.</NOTE> where two Indians brought him a buck from the Cacique of <HI>Vzachil.</HI> The next day he passed by a great towne called <HI>Hapaluya;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hapaluya a great towne.</NOTE> and lodged at <HI>Vzachil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vzachil.</NOTE> and found no peo∣ple in it, because they durst not tarrie for the notice the Indians had of the slaughter of <HI>Napetuca.</HI> He found in that towne great store of Maiz, french beanes, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Aboboras.</NOTE> pompions, which is their foode, and that where∣with the Christians there sustained themselues. The Maiz is like course millet, and the pompions are better and more sauorie then those of <HI>Spaine.</HI> From thence the Gouernour sent two Captaines each a sundry way to seeke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Indians. They tooke an hundred men and women: of which aswel there as in other places where they made any inrodes, the Captaine chose one or two for the Gouernour, and diuided the rest to himselfe, and those that went with him. They led these Indians in chaines with yron collars about their neckes; and they serued to carrie their stuffe, and to grind their Maiz, and for other seruices that such captiues could doe. Sometimes it happened that going for wood or
<PB N="37" REF="23"/> Maiz with them, they killed the Christian that led them, and ran away with the chaine: others filed their chaines by night with a peece of stone, wherewith they cut them, and vse it in stead of yron. Those that were perceiued paid for themselues, and for the rest, because they should not dare to doe the like another time. The women and young boyes, when they were once an hundred leagues from their Countrie, and had forgotten things, they let goe loose, and so they serued; and in a very short space they vnderstood the language of the Christians. From <HI>Vzachil</HI> the Gouer∣nour departed toward <HI>Apalache,</HI> and in two daies iournie, hee came to a towne called <HI>Axille,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Axille.</NOTE> and from thence forward the Indians were carelesse, because they had as yet no notice of the Christians. The next day in the morning, the first of October, he departed from thence, and commanded a bridge to bee made o∣uer a Riuer<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Riuer.</NOTE> which hee was to passe. The deepe of the Riuer where the bridge was made, was a stones cast, and forward a crossebow shot the water came to the waste; and the wood, whereby the Indians came to see if they could defend the passage, and disturbe those which made the bridge, was very hie and thicke. The crossebowmen so bestirred themselues that they made them giue back: and certain plancks were cast into the Riuer, whereon the men passed, which made good the passage: The Gouernor passed vpō Wednesday, which was S. <HI>Francis</HI> his day, and lodged at a towne which was called <HI>Vitachuco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vitachuco.</NOTE> subiect to <HI>Apalache:</HI> he found it burning; for the Indians had set it on fire. From thence forward the countrie was much inhabited, and had great store of Maiz. Hee passed by many granges like hamlets. On Sunday the 25. of October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 25</NOTE> he came

Vpon Satur∣day the 29. of Nouember,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nouem. 29.</NOTE> there came an Indian through the Watch vndiscouered, and set the towne on fire, and with the great wind that blew, two parts of it were consumed in a short time.

That day there went out eight horsemen by commandement of the Gouernor into the field, two leagues about the towne to seeke Indians: for they were now so emboldened, that within two crossebow shot of y<SUP>e</SUP> camp, they came and slew men. They found two men and a woman ga∣thering French Beanes: the men, though they might haue fled, yet because they would not leaue the wo∣man,
<PB N="40" REF="25"/> which was one of their wiues, they resolued to die fighting: and before they were slaine, they woun∣ded three horses, whereof one died within a few daies after. <HI>Calderan</HI> going with his men by the Sea∣coast, from a wood that was neere the place, the In∣dians set vpon him, and made him forsake his way, and many of them that went with him forsooke some ne∣cessarie victuals, which they carried with them. Three or foure daies after the limited time giuen by the Go∣uernour to <HI>Maldonado</HI> for his going and comming, be∣ing alreadie determined and resolued, if within eight daies he did not come, to tarrie no longer for him, he came, and brought an Indian from a Prouince, which was called <HI>Ochus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ochus 60. leagues West of Apalache.</NOTE> sixtie leagues Westward from <HI>Apa∣lache;</HI> where he had found a good Port of good depth and defense against weather.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N Wedensday the third of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March the 3. 1540.</NOTE> of the yeere 1540. the Gouernor departed from <HI>Anaica Apalache</HI> to seeke <HI>Yupaha.</HI> He com∣manded his men to goe prouided with Maiz for sixtie leagues of desert. The horsemen car∣ried their Maiz on their horses, and the footemen at their sides: because the Indians that were for seruice, with their miserable life that they lead that winter, be∣ing naked and in chaines, died for the most part. With∣in foure daies iournie they came to a great Riuer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Riuer.</NOTE> and they made a piragua or ferrie bote, and because of the great current, they made a cable with chaines, which they fastened on both sides of the Riuer; and the fer∣rie bote went along by it; and the horses swam ouer, being drawne with capstans. Hauing passed the Riuer, in a day and an halfe, they came to a towne called <HI>Ca∣pachiqui.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Capachiqui.</NOTE> Vpon Friday, the 11. of March, they found
<PB N="42" REF="26"/> Indians in armes. The next day fiue Christians went to seeke morters, which the Indians haue to beate their Maiz, and they went to certaine houses on the back∣side of the Campe enuironed with a wood: And with∣in the wood were many Indians which came to spie vs; of the which came other fiue and set vpon vs. One of the Christians came running away, giuing an a∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rme vnto the Campe. Those which were most readie answered the alarme. They found one Christian dead, and three sore wounded. The Indians fled vnto a lake adioyning neere a very thicke wood, where the horses could not enter. The Gouernour departed from <HI>Ca∣pachiqui,</HI> and passed through a desert. On Wednesday the 21. of the moneth he came to a towne called <HI>To∣alli:</HI> And from thence forward there was a difference in the houses. For those which were behind vs were thatched with straw, and those of <HI>Toalli</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Toalli.</NOTE> were couered with reeds, in manner of tiles. These houses are verie cleanly. Some of them had walles daubed with clay, which shewed like a mudwall. In all the cold Coun∣trie the Indians haue euery one a house for the winter daubed with clay within and without, and the doore is very little: they shut it by night, and make fire with∣in; so that they are in it as warme as in a stoue: and so it continueth all night that they need not clothes: and besides these, they haue others for summer; and their kitchins neere them, where they make fire and bake their bread: and they haue barbacoas wherein they keepe their Maiz; which is an house set vp in the aire vpon foure stakes, boorded about like a chamber, and the floore of it is of cane hurdles. The differēce which Lords or principall mens houses haue from the rest, besides they be greater, is, that they haue great galle∣ries
<PB N="43" REF="26"/> in their fronts, and vnder them seates made of canes in manner of benches: and round about them they haue many lofts, wherein they lay vp that which the Indians doe giue them for tribute, which is Maiz, Deeres skins, and mantles of the Countrie, which are like blankets: they make them of the inner rinde of the barkes of trees, and some of a kind of grasse like vnto nettles, which being beaten, is like vnto flaxe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A grasse like flaxe.</NOTE> The wo∣men couer themselues with these mantles; they put one about them from the wast downeward; and ano∣ther ouer their shoulder, with their right arme out, like vnto the Egyptians. The men weare but one mantle vpon their shoulders after the same manner: and haue their secrets hid with a Deeres skin, made like a linen breech, which was wont to be vsed in <HI>Spaine.</HI> The skins are well corried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excellent colours.</NOTE> and they giue them what colour they list, so perfect, that if it be red, it seemeth a very fine cloth in graine, and the blacke is most fine: and of the same leather they make shooes; and they die their man∣tles in the same colours. The Gouernour departed from <HI>Toalli</HI> the 24. of March: he came on Thursday at euening to a small Riuer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A small Riuer.</NOTE> where a bridge was made whereon the people passed, and <HI>Benit Fernandez</HI> a Por∣tugall fell off from it, and was drowned. Assoone as the Gouernour had passed the Riuer, a little distance thence he found a towne called <HI>Achese.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Achese.</NOTE> The Indians had no notice of the Christians: they leaped into a Riuer: some men and women were taken; among which was one that vnderstood the youth which gui∣ded the Gouernour to <HI>Yupaha:</HI> whereby that which he had reported was more confirmed. For they had passed through Countries of diuers languages, and some which he vnderstood not. The Gouernour sent
<PB N="44" REF="27"/> by one of the Indians that were taken to call the Caci∣que, which was on the other side of the Riuer. Hee came and made this speech following:</P>
<P><HI>Right high, right mightie, and excellent Lord, those things which seldome happen doe cause admiration. What then may the sight of your Lordship, and your people doe to mee and mine, whom we neuer saw? especially being mounted on such fierce beasts as your horses are, entring with such violence and furie into my Countrie, without my knowledge of your comming. It was a thing so strange, and caused such feare and terrour in our mindes, that it was not in our power to stay and receiue your Lordship with the solemnitie due to so high and renowned a Prince, as your Lordship is. And tru∣sting in your greatnesse and singular vertues, I doe not onely hope to be freed from blame, but also to receiue fauours: and the first which I demand of your Lordship is, that you will vse me, my Countrie, and subiects as your owne: and the second, that you will tell mee who you are, and whence you come, and whither you goe, and what you seeke, that I the better may serue you therein.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour answered him, that hee thanked him as much for his offer and good will, as if hee had receiued it, and as if hee had offered him a great trea∣sure: and told him that he was the sonne of the Sun, and came from those parts where he dwelt, and trauel∣led through that Countrie, and sought the greatest Lord, and richest Prouince that was in it. The Caci∣que told him; that farther forward dwelt a great Lord, and that his dominion was calle <HI>Ocute.</HI> He gaue him a guide, and an interpretour for that Prouince. The Go∣uernour commanded his Indians to bee set free, and trauelled through his Countrie vp a Riuer very well inhabited.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> He departed from his towne the first of A∣prill;
<PB N="45" REF="27"/> and left a very high crosse of Wood set vp in the middest of the market place: and because the time gaue no more leasure, hee declared to him onely, that that crosse was a memorie of y<SUP>e</SUP> same, whereon Christ, which was God and man, and created the heauens and the earth, suffered for our saluation: therefore he exhorted them that they should reuerence it: and they made shew as though they would doe so. The fourth of Aprill the Gouernour passed by a towne called <HI>Al∣tamaca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Altamaca.</NOTE> and the 10. of the moneth he came to <HI>Ocute.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ocute.</NOTE> The Cacique sent him two thousand Indians with a present, to wit, many conies, and partriges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conies, Patri∣ges, Hens, Dogges.</NOTE> bread of Maiz, two hens, and many dogs: which among the Christians were esteemed as if they had been fat we∣thers, because of the great want of flesh meate and salt, and hereof in many places, and many times was great need; and they were so scarse, that if a man fell sicke, there was nothing to cherish him withall: and with a sicknesse, that in another place easilie might haue been remedied, he consumed away till nothing but skinne and bones were left: and they died of pure weaknes, some of them saying, If I had a slice of meate, or a few cornes of salt, I should not die. The Indians want no fleshmeat: for they kill with their arrowes many deere, hennes, conies, and other wild fowle: for they are very cunning at it: which skill the Christians had not: and though they had it, they had no leasure to vse it: for the most of the time they spent in trauell, and durst not presume to straggle aside. And because they were thus scanted of flesh, when sixe hundred men that went with <HI>Soto,</HI> came to any towne, and found 30. or 40. dogs, he that could get one and kill it, thought himselfe no small man: and he that killed it,
<PB N="46" REF="28"/> and gaue not his Captaine one quarter, if he knew it, he frowned on him, and made him feele it, in the wat∣ches, or in any other matter of labour that was offered, wherein hee might doe him a displeasure. On Mon∣day the 12. of Aprill, the Gouernour departed from <HI>Ocute:</HI> The Cacique gaue him two hundred <HI>Tamenes,</HI> to wit, Indians to carrie burdens: hee passed through a towne, the Lord whereof was named <HI>Cofaqui,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cofaqui.</NOTE> and came to a prouince of an Indian Lord, called <HI>Pato∣fa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Patofa.</NOTE> who, because he was in peace with the Lord of <HI>Ocu∣te,</HI> and with the other bordering Lords, had many daies before notice of the Gouernour, and desired to see him: He came to visit him, and made this speech following.</P>
<P><HI>Mightie Lord, now with good reason I will craue of for∣tune to requite this my so great prosperitie with some small ad∣uersitie; and I will count my selfe verie rich, seeing I haue obtained that, which in this world I most desired, which is, to see, and bee able to doe your Lordship some seruice. And al∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh the tongue bee the image of that which is in the heart, and that the contentment which I feele in my heart I cannot dissemble, yet is it not sufficent wholly to manifest the same. Where did this your Countrie, which I doe gouerne, deserue to be visited of so soueraigne, and so excellent a Prince, whom all the rest of the world ought to obey and serue? And those which inhabit it being so base, what shall bee the issue of such happines, if their memorie doe not represent vnto them some aduersitie that may betide them, according to the order of for∣tune? If from this day forward we may be capable of this be∣nefit, that your Lordship will hold vs for your owne, we cannot faile to be fauoured and maintained in true iustice and rea∣son, and to haue the name of men. For such as are void of reason and iustice, may bee compared to brute beasts. For
<PB N="47" REF="28"/> mine owne part, from my very heart with reuerence due to such a Prince, I offer my selfe vnto your Lordship, &amp; beseech you; that in reward of this my true good will, you will vouch∣safe to make vse of mine owne person, my Countrie, and subiects.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour answered him, that his offers and good wil declared by the effect, did highly please him, whereof he would alwaies be mindfull to honour and fauour him as his brother. This Countrie, from the first peaceable Cacique, vnto the Prouince of <HI>Patofa,</HI> which were fiftie leagues, is a fat Countrie, beautifull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An excellent Countrie for 50. leagues.</NOTE> and very fruitfull, and very well watered, and full of good Riuers. And from thence to the Port <HI>de Spiri∣to Santo,</HI> where wee first ariued in the land of <HI>Florida,</HI> (which may bee 350. leagues, little more or lesse) is a barren land, and the most of it groues of wild Pine∣trees, low and full of lakes, and in some places very hie and thicke groues, whither the Indians that were in armes fled, so that no man could find them, neither could any horses enter into them. Which was an inconuenience to the Christians, in regard of the victuals which they found conueied away; and of the trouble which they had in seeking of Indians to bee their guides.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> How th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gouernour departed from the Prouince of <HI>Pato∣fa,</HI> and went through a desert, where he and all his men fe l into great distresse, and extreme miserie.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the towne of <HI>Patofa</HI> the youth, which the Go∣uernour carried with him for an interpretour and a guide, began to some at the mouth, and tum∣ble on the ground, as one possessed with the diuell:
<PB N="48" REF="29"/> They said a Gospell ouer him; and the fit left him. And he said, that foure daies iournie from thence toward the Sunne rising, was the prouince that he spake of. The Indians of <HI>Patofa</HI> said, that toward that part they knew no habitation; but that toward the Northwest, they knew a Prouince which was called <HI>Coça,</HI> a verie plentifull countrie, which had very great townes in it. The Cacique told the Gouernour, that if he would go thither, he would giue him guides and Indians for bur∣dens; and if he would goe whither the youth spake of, that he would likewise giue him those that he needed: and so with louing words and offers of courtesie, they tooke their leaues the one of the other. Hee gaue him seuen hundred Indians to beare burdens. He tooke Maiz for foure daies iournie. Hee trauelled sixe daies by a path which grew narrow more and more, till it was lost altogether: He went where the youth did lead him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two swift Riuers.</NOTE> and passed two Riuers which were waded: each of them was two crossebow shot ouer: the water came to the stirrops, and had so great a current, that it was needfull for the horsemen to stand one before a∣nother, that the footemen might passe aboue them lea∣ning vnto them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another greater Riuer.</NOTE> He came to another Riuer of a grea∣ter current and largenes, which was passed with more trouble, because the horses did swim at the comming out about a lances length. Hauing passed this Riuer, the Gouernor came to a groue of pinetrees, and threat∣ned the youth, and made as though hee would haue cast him to the dogges, because he had told him a lie, saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> daies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> it was but foure daies iournie, and they had trauelled nine, and euery day 7. or 8. leagues, and the men by this time were growne wearie and weake, and the horses leane through the great scanting of the
<PB N="49" REF="29"/> Maiz. The youth said, that hee knew not where hee was. It saued him that he was not cast to the dogges, that there was neuer another whom <HI>Iohn Ortiz</HI> did vn∣derstand. The Gouernour with them two, and with some horsemen and footemen, leauing the Campe in a groue of pinetrees, trauelled that day 5. or. 6. leagues to seek a way, and returned at night very comfortlesse, and without finding any signe of way or towne. The next day there were sundrie opinions deliuered, whe∣ther they should goe backe, or what they should doe: and because backward the Countrie whereby they had passed was greatly spoiled and destitute of Maiz, and that which they brought with them was spent, and the men were very weake, and the horses likewise, they doubted much whether they might come to any place where they might helpe themselues. And be∣sides this, they were of opinion, that going in that sort out of order, that any Indians would presume to set vpon them, so that with hunger, or with warre, they could not escape. The Gouernour determined to send horsemen from thence euery way to seeke habi∣tation: and the next day he sent foure Captaines, eue∣ry one a sundrie way with eight horsemen. At night they came againe, leading their horses, or driuing them with a sticke before; for they were so wearie, that they could not lead them; neither found they any way nor signe of habitation. The next day, the Go∣uernour sent other foure with as many horsemen that could swim, to passe the Ose and Riuers which they should find, and they had choice horses the best that were in the Campe. The Captaines were <HI>Baltasar de Gallegos,</HI> which went vp the Riuer; and <HI>Iohn Danusco,</HI> downe the Riuer: <HI>Alfonso Romo,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Rodriguez
<PB N="50" REF="30"/> Lobillo</HI> went into the inward parts of the land. The Gouernour brought with him into <HI>Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rida</HI> thirteene sowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great in∣crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ne.</NOTE> and had by this time three hundred swine: He commanded euery man should haue halfe a pound of hogs flesh euery day: and this hee did three or foure daies after the Maiz was all spent. With this small quantitie of flesh, and some sodden hearbs, with much trouble the people were sustained. The Gouernour dismissed y<SUP>e</SUP> Indians of <HI>Patofa,</HI> because hee had no food to giue them; who desiring to accompanie and serue the Christians in their necessitie, making shew that it grieued them very much to returne, vntill they had left them in a peopled Countrie, returned to their owne home. <HI>Iohn Danusco</HI> came on Sunday late in the eue∣ning, and brought newes that he had found a little towne 12. or 13. leagues from thence: he brought a wo∣man and a boy that he tooke there. With his comming and with those newes, the Gouernour and all the rest were so glad, that they seemed at that instant to haue returned from death to life. Vpon Monday, the twen∣tie sixe of Aprill, the Gouernour departed to goe to the towne, which was called <HI>Aymay;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aymay.</NOTE> and the Christi∣ans named it the towne of <HI>Reliefe.</HI> He left where the Camp had lien at the foote of a Pinetree a letter bu∣ried, and letters carued in the barke of the pine, the contents whereof was this: Dig here at the foot of this pine, &amp; you shal find a letter. And this he did, because when the Captaines came, which were sent to seeke some habitation, they might see the letter, and know what was become of the Gouernour, and which way he was gone. There was no other way to the town, but the markes that <HI>Iohn Danusco</HI> left made vpon the trees. The Gouernour with some of them that had the best
<PB N="51" REF="30"/> horses came to it on the Monday: And all the rest in∣forcing themselues the best they could, some of them lodged within two leagues of the towne, some within three and foure, euery one as he was able to goe, and his strength serued him. There was found in the towne a storehouse full of the flowre of parched Maiz; and some Maiz, which was distributed by allowance. Here were foure Indians taken, and none of them would confesse any other thing, but that they knew of none other habitation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Indian burned for his falsehood.</NOTE> The Gouernour commanded one of them to be burned; &amp; presently another confessed, that two daies iournie from thence, there was a Pro∣uince that was called <HI>Cutifa-Chiqui.</HI> Vpon Wednesday came the Captaines <HI>Baltasar de Gallegos, Alfonso Romo,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Rodriguez Lobillo:</HI> for they had found the let∣ter, and followed the way which the Gouernour had taken toward the towne. Two men of <HI>Iohn Rodriguez</HI> companie were lost, because their horses tired: the Gouernour checked him very sore for leauing them behind, and sent to seeke them: and assoone as they came, he departed toward <HI>Cutifa-Chiqui.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cutifa-Chiqui.</NOTE> In the way three Indians were taken, which said, that the Ladie of that Countrie had notice alreadie of the Christians, and staied for them in a towne of hers. The Gouer∣nour sent by one of them to offer her his friendship, and to aduertise her how hee was comming thither. The Gouernour came vnto the towne: and presently there came foure canoes to him; in one of them came a sister of the Ladie, and approching to the Gouernour she said these words:</P>
<P><HI>Excellent Lord, my sister sendeth vnto you by me to kisse your Lordships hands, and to signifie vnto you, that the cause why she came not in person, is, that she thinketh to do you grea∣ter
<PB N="52" REF="31"/> seruice staying behind, as she doth, giuing order, that with all speed, al her canoes be readie, that your Lordship may passe the Riuer, and take your rest, which shall bee presentlie per∣formed.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour gaue her thankes, and she returned to the other side of the Riuer. Within a little while the Ladie came out of the towne in a Chaire, whereon certaine of the principall Indians brought her to the Riuer. She entred into a barge, which had the sterne tilted ouer, and on the floore her mat readie laied with two cushions vpō it one vpon another, where she sate her downe; and with her came her principall Indians in other barges, which did wait vpon her. She went to the place where the Gouernor was, and at her com∣ming she made this speech following:</P>
<P><HI>Excellent Lord, I wish this comming of your Lordship in∣to these your Countries, to be most happie: although my power be not answerable to my wil, and my seruices be not according to my desire, nor such as so high a Prince, as your Lordship, deserueth; yet since the good will is rather to be accepted, then all the treasures of the world, that without it are offered, with most vnfaileable and manifest affection, I offer you my person, lands, and subiects, and this small seruice.</HI></P>
<P>And therewithal she presented vnto him great store of clothes of the Countrie, which shee brought in o∣ther canoes; to wit, mantles and skinnes; and tooke from her owne necke a great cordon of perles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> perles.</NOTE> and cast it about the necke of the Gouernour, entertaining him with very gracious speeches of loue and courtesie, and commanded canoes to be brought thither, where∣in the Gouernour and his people passed the Riuer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Riue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

Within a league, and halfe a league about this towne, were great townes dispeopled, and ouergrowne with grasse; which shewed, that they had been long without inhabitants. The Indians said, that two yeere before there was a plague in that Countrie, and that they remooued to other townes. There was in their storehouses great quantitie of clothes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mantles of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> barkes of trees.

There were al∣so many Deeres skinnes, with many compartiments traced in them, and some of them made into hose, stockings, and shooes. And the Ladie perceiuing, that the Christians esteemed the perles, aduised the Go∣uernour to send to search certaine graues that were in that towne, and that hee should find many: and that if hee would send to the dispeopled townes, hee might load all his horses. They sought the graues of that towne, and there found foureteene rooues of perles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three hun∣dred ninetie two pounds of pearles found.</NOTE> and little babies and birds made of them. The people were browne, well made, and well proportioned, and more ciuill then any others that were seene in all the Countrie of <HI>Florida,</HI> and all of them went shod and clothed. The youth told the Gouernour, that hee be∣gan now to enter into the land which he spake of: and some credit was giuen him that it was so, because hee vnderstood the language of the Indians: and hee re∣quested that he might bee Christened, for he said hee desired to become a Christian: Hee was Christened, and named <HI>Peter;</HI> and the Gouernour commanded
<PB N="54" REF="32"/> him to bee loosed from a chaine, in which vntill that time he had gone. This Countrie, as the Indians repor∣ted, had been much inhabited, and had the same of a good Countrie. And, as it seemeth, the youth, which was the Gouernours guide, had heard of it, and that which he knew by heresay, hee affirmed that hee had seene, and augmented at his pleasure. In this towne was found a dagger, and beades, that had belonged to Christians.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This towne was but two daies iournie from the ha¦uen of Santa Helena.</NOTE> The Indians reported, that Christians had been in the hauen, which was two daies iournie from this towne, many yeeres agoe. Hee that came thither was the Gouernour, the <HI>Licenciate Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon,</HI> which went to conquer this Countrie, and at his comming to the Port hee died;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the yeere 1525.</NOTE> and there was a diuision, quarrels and slaughters betweene some prin∣cipall men which went with him, for the principall gouernment: And without knowing any thing of the Countrie, they returned home to <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> All the Companie thought it good to inhabit that Coun∣trie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is in 32. degrees</NOTE> because it was in a temperat climate: And that if it were inhabited, al the shippes of New Spaine, of <HI>Peru, Santa Martha,</HI> and <HI>Tierr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rme,</HI> in their returne for <HI>Spaine,</HI> might well touch there: because it was in their way; and because it was a good Countrie, and sited fit to raise commoditie. The Gouernour, since his intent was to seeke another treasure, like that of <HI>Atabalipa</HI> Lord of <HI>Peru,</HI> was not contented with a good Coun∣trie, nor with pearles, though many of them were worth their weight in gold. And if the Countrie had been diuided among the Christians, those which the Indians had fished for afterward, would haue been of more value: for those which they had, because they burned them in the fire, did leese their colour. The
<PB N="55" REF="32"/> Gouernour answered them, that vrged him to inha∣bit, That in all the Countrie, there were not victuals to sustaine his men one moneth; and that it was needfull to resort to the Port of <HI>Ocus,</HI> where <HI>Maldanado</HI> was to stay for them: and that if no richer Countrie were found, they might returne againe to that whensoeuer they would: and in the meane time the Indians would sow their fields, and it would be better furnished with Maiz. He inquired of the Indians, whether they had notice of any great Lord farther into the land. They told him, that 12. daies iournie from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chiaha 12. daies iournie from Santa Helena: and Coste 7. daies iournie from Chiaha: at which towne of Coste, they had an oxe hide: Chap. 16.</NOTE> there was a Prouince called <HI>Chiaha,</HI> subiect to the Lord of <HI>Coça.</HI> Presently the Gouernour determined to seeke that land. And being a sterne man, and of few words, though he was glad to sift and know the opinion of all men, yet after hee had deliuered his owne, hee would not be contraried, and alwaies did what liked himselfe, and so all men did condescend vnto his will. And though it seemed an errour to leaue that Countrie, (for others might haue been sought round about, where the people might haue been sustained, vntill the haruest had been readie there, and the Maiz gathered) yet there was none that would say any thing against him, after they knew his resolution.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P> How the Gouernour departed from <HI>Cutifa-Chiqui</HI> to seeke the Prouince of <HI>Coça;</HI> and what happened vn∣to him in the way.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Gouernour departed from <HI>Cutifa Chiqui</HI> the third day of May. And because the Indi∣ans had reuolted, and the will of the Ladie was perceiued, that if she could, she would depart without
<PB N="56" REF="33"/> giuing any guides or men for burdens, for the wrongs which the Christians had done to the Indians: (for there neuer want some among many of a base sort, that for a little gaine doe put themselues and others in dan∣ger of vndoing.) The Gouernour commanded her to be kept in safegard, and carried with him, not with so good vsage as she deserued for y<SUP>e</SUP> good wil she shewed, and good entertainement that she had made him. And he verified that old prouerb which saith; For weldoing I receiue euill. And so he carried her on foot with his bondwomen to looke vnto her. In all the townes where the Gouernour passed, the Ladie commanded the Indians to come and carrie the burdens from one towne to another. We passed through her Countrie an hundred leagues, in which, as we saw, she was much obeyed. For the Indians did all that she commanded them with great efficacie and diligence. <HI>Peter</HI> the youth that was our guide, said, that she was not the La∣die her selfe, but a neece of hers, which came to that towne to execute certaine principal men by comman∣dement of the Ladie, which had withheld her tribute: which words were not beleeued, because of the lies which they had found in him before: but they bare with all things, because of the need which they had of him, to declare what the Indians said. In seuen daies space the Gouernour came to a Prouince called <HI>Chala∣que,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chalaque se∣uen daies iournie from Cutifa Chi∣q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.</NOTE> the poorest Country of Maiz that was seene in <HI>Flo∣rida.</HI> The Indians fed vpon rootes and herbes which they seeke in the fields, and vpon wild beasts, which they kil with their bowes and arrowes: and it is a verie gentle people. All of them goe naked, and are very leane. There was a Lord, which for a great present, brought the Gouernour two Deeres skins: and there
<PB N="57" REF="33"/> were in that Countrie many wild hennes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">700. Hennes.</NOTE> In one towne they made him a present of 700. hennes, and so in other townes they sent him those which they had or could get. From this Prouince to another, which is called <HI>Xualla,</HI> he spent fiue daies:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xualla 5. daies off.</NOTE> here he found very little Maiz; and for this cause, though the people were wearied, and the horses very weake, he staied no more but two daies. From <HI>Ocute</HI> to <HI>Cutifa-chiqui,</HI> may bee some hundred and thirtie leagues, whereof 80. are wildernesse. From <HI>Cutifa-chiqui</HI> to <HI>Xualla,</HI> two hundred and fiftie, and it is an hillie Countrie. The Gouernour departed from <HI>Xualla</HI> toward <HI>Guaxule:</HI> he passed very rough and hie hilles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rough and hie hilles.</NOTE> In that iournie, the Ladie of <HI>Cu∣tifa-chiqui</HI> (whom the Gouernour carried with him, as is afore said, with purpose to carrie her to <HI>Guaxule,</HI> because her territorie reached thither) going on a day with the bondwomen which lead her, went out of the way, and entred into a wood, saying, she went to ease her selfe, and so she deceiued them, and hid her selfe in the wood; and though they sought her they could not find her. She carried away with her a little chest made of canes in manner of a coffer, which they call Petaca, full of vnbored perles. Some which could iudge of them, said, that they were of great value. An Indian woman that waited on her did carrie them. The Go∣uernour not to discontent her altogether, left them with her, making account that in <HI>Guaxule</HI> he would ask them of her, when he gaue her leaue to returne: which coffer she carried away, and went to <HI>Xualla</HI> with three slaues which fled from the Campe, and one horseman which remained behind, who falling sicke of an ague went out of the way, and was lost. This man, whose name was <HI>Alimamos,</HI> dealt with the slaues to change
<PB N="58" REF="34"/> their euill purpose, and returne with him to the Chri∣stians: which two of them did; and <HI>Alimamos</HI> and they ouertooke the Gouernour 50. leagues from thence in a Prouince called <HI>Chiaha;</HI> and reported how the Ladie remained in <HI>Xualla</HI> with a slaue of <HI>Andrew de Vasconcellos,</HI> which would not come backe with them, and that of a certaintie they liued as man and wife together, and meant to goe both to <HI>Cutifa-chiqui.</HI> Within fiue daies the Gouernour came to <HI>Guaxule.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Guaxule fiue daies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f.</NOTE> The Indians there gaue him a present of 300. dogges, because they saw the Christians esteeme them, and sought them to feed on them: for among them they are not eaten. In <HI>Guaxule,</HI> and all that way, was very little Maiz. The Gouernour sent from thence an In∣dian with a message to the Cacique of <HI>Chiaha,</HI> to desire him to gather some Maiz thither, that he might rest a few daies in <HI>Chiaha.</HI> The Gouernour departed from <HI>Guaxule,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Canasagua two daies iournie off.

Indians euery one loaden with a basket ful of Mulberries: for there be many, and those very good, from <HI>Cutifa-chiqui</HI> thither, and so forward in other Prouinces, and also nuts and plummes. And the trees grow in the fields without planting or dressing them, and are as big and as rancke, as though they grew in gardens digged and watered. From the time that the Gouernour depar∣ted from <HI>Canasagua,</HI> hee iournied fiue daies through a desert; and two leagues before hee came to <HI>Chiaha,</HI> there met him 15. Indians loaden with Maiz, which the Cacique had sent; and they told him on his be∣halfe, that he waited his comming with 20. barnes full of it; and farther, that himselfe, his Countrie, and sub∣iects, &amp; al things els were at his seruice. On the 5. day of
<PB N="59" REF="34"/> Iune, the Gouernor entred into <HI>Chiaha:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune 5. Chiaha fiue daies iournie off, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. leagues from Xualla.</NOTE> The Cacique voided his owne houses, in which he lodged, &amp; recei∣ued him with much ioy, saying these words following:</P>
<P><HI>Mightie and excellent Lord, I hold my selfe for so happie a man, in that it hath pleased your Lordship to vse me, that nothing could haue happened vnto me of more contentment, nor that I would haue esteemed so much. From</HI> Guaxule <HI>your Lordship sent vnto me, that I should prepare Maiz for you in this towne for two moneths: Here I haue for you</HI> 20. <HI>barnes full of the choisest that in all the Countrie could be found. If your Lordship bee not entertained by me in such sort, as is fit for so hie a Prince, respect my tender age, which excuseth me from blame, and receiue my good wil, which with much loyaltie, truth, and sinceritie, I will alwaies shew in any thing, which shall concerne your Lordships seruice.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernor answered him, that he thanked him very much for his seruice and offer, and that he would alwaies account him as his brother. There was in this towne much butter in gourds melted like oile: they said it was the fat of beares.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fat of beares.</NOTE> There was found also great store of oile of walnuts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oile of Wal∣nuts.</NOTE> which was cleare as but∣ter, and of a good taste, and a pot full of honie of bees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honie of Bees.</NOTE> which neither before nor afterward was seene in all the Countrie. The towne was in an Island<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chiaha seated in an Island.</NOTE> betweene two armes of a Riuer, and was seated nigh one of them. The Riuer diuideth it selfe into those two branches two crossebow shot aboue the towne, and meeteth againe a league beneath the same. The plaine betweene both the branches is sometimes one crosse∣bow shot, sometimes two crossebow shot ouer. The branches are very broad, and both of them may be waded ouer. There were all along them verie good meadows, and manie fields sowne with Maiz. And
<PB N="60" REF="35"/> because the Indians staied in their towne, the Gouer∣nour only lodged in the houses of the Cacique, and his people in the fields; where there was euer a tree, e∣uerie one tooke one for himselfe. Thus the Camp lay separated one from another, and out of order. The Gouernour winked at it, because the Indians were in peace, and because it was very hot, and the people should haue suffered great extremitie, if it had not bin so. The horses came thither so weake, that for feeble∣nesse, they were not able to carrie their masters: because that from <HI>Cutifa-chiqui,</HI> they alwaies trauelled with ve∣rie little prouender, and were hunger-starued and tired euer since they came from the desert of <HI>Ocute.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The desert of Ocute, chap. 14.</NOTE> And be∣cause the most of them were not in case to vse in bat∣tell, though need should require, they sent them to feed in the night a quarter of a league from the Camp. The Christians were there in great danger, because that if at this time the Indians had set vpon them, they had been in euill case to haue defended themselues. The Gouernour rested there thirtie daies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30. Daies rest.</NOTE> in which time, because the Countrie was very fruitfull, the hor∣ses grew fat. At the time of his departure, by the im∣portunitie of some, which would haue more then was reason, hee demanded of the Cacique 30. women to make slaues of. Hee answered that he would conferre with his chiefe men. And before hee returned an an∣swere, one night all of them with their wiues and chil∣dren forsooke the towne, and fled away. The next day the Gouernour purposing to goe to seeke them, the Cacique came vnto him, and at his comming vsed these words vnto the Gouernour:</P>
<P><HI>Mightie Lord, with shame and feare of your Lordship, because my subiects against my will haue done amisse in ab∣senting
<PB N="61" REF="35"/> themselues, I went my way without your license; and knowing the errour which I haue committed, like a loyall sub∣iect, I come to yeeld my selfe into your power, to dispose of mee at your owne pleasure. For my subiects do not obey mee, nor doe any thing but what an Vncle of mine commandeth, which gouerneth this Countrie for me, vntill I be of a perfect age. If your Lordship will pursue them, and execute on them that, which for their disobedience they deserue, I will be your guide, since at this present my fortune will not suffer me to performe any more.</HI></P>
<P>Presently the Gouernour with 30. horsemen, and as many footemen, went to seeke the Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certaine townes.</NOTE> and pas∣sing by some townes of the principall Indians which had absented themselues, hee cut and destroyed great fields of Maiz; and went vp the Riuer, where the In∣dians were in an Island, where the horsemen could not come at them. There he sent them word by an In∣dian to returne to their towne and feare nothing, and that they should giue him men to carrie burdens, as al those behind had done; for he would haue no Indian women, seeing they were so loth to part with them. The Indians accepted his request, and came to the Go∣uernour to excuse themselues; and so all of them re∣turned to their towne. A Cacique of a Prouince cal∣eld <HI>Coste,</HI> came to this towne to visit the Gouernour. After hee had offered himselfe, and passed with him some words of tendring his seruice and curtesie; the Gouernour asking him whether he had notice of any rich Countrie? he said, <Q REND="margQuotes">yea: to wit, that toward the North, there was a Prouince named <HI>Chisca:</HI> and that there was a melting of copper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mines of cop∣per and gold in Chisca to∣ward the North.</NOTE> and of another metall of the same colour, saue that it was finer, and of a farre more perfect colour, and farre better to the sight; and
<PB N="62" REF="36"/> that they vsed it not so much, because it was softer. </Q> And the selfe same thing was told the Gouernour in <HI>Cutifa-chiqui;</HI> where we saw some little hatchets of cop∣per, which were said to haue a mixture of gold.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chets of coppe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hol∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng gold.</NOTE> But in that part the Countrie was not well peopled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chisca is di∣rectly North from Catifa-Chiqui, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s within two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aies of Santa Helena.</NOTE> and they said there were mountaines, which the horses could not passe: and for that cause, the Gouernour would not goe from <HI>Cutifa-chiqui</HI> directly thither: And hee made account, that trauelling through a peopled Countrie, when his men and horses should bee in bet∣ter plight, and hee were better certified of the truth of the thing, he would returne toward it, by mountaines, and a better inhabited Countrie, whereby hee might haue better passage.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo Christi∣ans s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt from Chiaha to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeke Chisca.</NOTE> He sent two Christians from <HI>Chia∣ha</HI> with certaine Indians which knew the Countrie of <HI>Chisca,</HI> and the language thereof to view it, and to make report of that which they should find; where he told them that he would tarrie for them.</P>

The Gouernour seeing them al in an vprore, and him∣selfe among them with so few Christians, to escape their hands vsed a stratagem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wise stra∣tagem.</NOTE> farre against his owne dis∣position, being, as hee was, very francke and open: and though it grieued him very much that any Indian should be so bold, as with reason, or without reason to despise the Christians, he tooke vp a cudgel, and tooke their parts against his owne men; which was a meanes to quiet them: And presently he sent word by a man very secretly to the Campe, that some armed men should come toward the place where he was; and hee tooke the Cacique by the hand, vsing very mild words vnto him, and with some principall Indians that did accompanie him, he drew them out of the towne into a plaine way, and vnto the sight of the Campe, whi∣ther by little and little with good discretion the Chri∣stians began to come and to gather about them. Thus the Gouernour led the Cacique, and his chiefe men vntill he entred with them into the Campe: and neere vnto his tent, hee commanded them to be put in safe custodie: and told them, that they should not depart without giuing him a guide and Indians for burthens,

<P>The Gouernour answered him, that his good will and offer was as acceptable vnto him, as if he had offe∣red him all the treasures of the world, and that hee would alwaies intreate, fauour, and esteeme him as if he were his owne brother.

<P><HI>Excellent and mightie Lord, aboue all them of the earth; although I come but now to receiue you, yet I haue receiued you many daies agoe in my heart, to wit, from the day wherein I had first notice of your Lordship; with so great desire to serue you, with so great pleasure and contentment, that this which I make shew of, is nothing in regard of that which is in my heart, neither can it haue any kind of comparison.

The Gouernor sent out foure Captaines, euery one his way to seeke them.

Of those which were taken prisoners, some principall men were set at libertie, whom the Cacique demanded: and euery one that had any, carried the rest in chaines like slaues, without letting them goe to their Countrie: neither did any returne, but some few, whose fortune helped them with the good diligence which they vsed to file off their chaines by night, or such as in their trauelling could slippe aside out of the way, seeing any negli∣gence in them that kept them: some escaped away with the chaines, and with the burdens, and clothes which they carried.</P>

It was knowne af∣terward, that they were determined to take the Caci∣que of <HI>Coça</HI> from the Gouernour, if hee had requested it. The Gouernour commanded all his people to en∣ter the towne, which was walled about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vllibahali walled about.</NOTE> and neere vn∣to it passed a small Riuer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fashion of their walles.</NOTE> The wall, aswell of that, as of others, which afterward wee saw, was of great posts thrust deepe into the ground and very rough, and ma∣ny long railes as big as ones arme laid acrosse between them, and the wall was about the height of a lance, and it was daubed within and without with clay, and had loope holes.

The Gouernour com∣manded to call the Cacique; who came, and betweene them passed some words of loue and offer of his serui∣ces, and hee presented vnto him 40. Indians. There came to the Gouernour in this towne a principall In∣dian in the behalfe of the Cacique of <HI>Tascaluca,</HI> and made this speech following:</P>
<P><HI>Mightie, vertuous, and esteemed Lord, the great Caci∣que of</HI> Tascaluca <HI>my Lord, sendeth by me to kisse your Lord∣ships hands, and to let you vnderstand, that he hath notice, how you iustly rauish with your perfections and power, all men on the earth; and that euerie one by whom your Lordship passeth doth serue and obey you; which he acknowledgeth to be due vnto you, and desireth, as his life, to see, and to serue your Lordship. For which cause by me he offereth himselfe, his lands and subiects, that when your Lordship pleaseth to go through his Countrie, you may be receiued with all peace and loue, serued and obeyed; and that in recompense of the desire
<PB N="70" REF="40"/> he hath to see you, you will doe him the fauour to let him know when you will come: for how much the sooner, so much the greater fauour he shall receiue.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour receiued and dispatched him gra∣ciously, giuing him beades, which among them were not much esteemed, and some other things to carrie to his Lord. And he gaue licence to the Cacique of <HI>Coça</HI> to returne home to his owne Countries. The Cacique of <HI>Tallise</HI> gaue him such men for burthens as he nee∣ded. And after he had rested there 20. daies, hee de∣parted thence toward <HI>Tascaluca.</HI> That day when hee went from <HI>Tallise,</HI> hee lodged at a great towne called <HI>Casiste.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te a great towne.</NOTE> And the next day passed by another, and came to a small towne of <HI>Tascaluca;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>caluca.</NOTE> and the next day hee camped in a wood two leagues from the towne where the Cacique resided, and was at that time. And he sent the Master of the Camp, <HI>Luys de Moscoso,</HI> with 15. horsemen, to let him know how hee was comming. The Cacique was in his lodgings vnder a Canopie: and without doores, right against his lodgings, in an high place, they spread a mat for him, &amp; two cushions one vpon another, where he sat him downe, and his In∣dians placed themselues round about him, somewhat distant from him, so that they made a place, and a void roome where he sate: and his chiefest men were nee∣rest to him, and one with a shadow of Deeres skinne, which keept the Sunne from him, being round, and of the bignes of a target, quartered with black and white, hauing a rundell in the middest: a farre off it seemed to be of taffata, because y<SUP>e</SUP> colours were very perfect. It was set on a small staffe stretched wide out. This was the deuice which hee carried in his warres. Hee was a man of a very tall stature, of great limmes, and spare,
<PB N="71" REF="40"/> and well proportioned, and was much feared of his neighbours and subiects. He was Lord of many terri∣tories and much people: In his countenance hee was very graue. After the Master of the Campe had spo∣ken with him, he and those that went with him cour∣sed their horses, pransing them to and fro, and now and then toward the place where the Cacique was, who with much grauitie and dissimulation now and then lifted vp his eies, and beheld them as it were with dis∣daine. At the Gouernours comming, hee made no offer at all to rise. The Gouernour tooke him by the hand, and both of them sat downe together on a seate which was vnder the cloth of estate. The Cacique said these words vnto him:</P>
<P><HI>Mighty Lord, I bid your Lordship right hartily welcome. I receiue as much pleasure and contentment with your sight, as if you were my brother whom I dearely loued: vpon this point it is not needfull to vse many reasons; since it is no discretion to speake that in many wordes, which in few may be vttered. How much the greater the will is, so much more giueth it name to the workes, and the workes giue testimonie of the truth. Now touching my will, by it you shall know, how cer∣tain &amp; manifest it is, and how pure inclination I haue to serue you. Concerning the fauour which you did me, in the thing which you sent me, I make as much account of them as is rea∣son to esteeme them: and chiefly because they were yours. Now see what seruice you will command me.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernor satisfied him with sweet words, and with great breuitie. When hee departed from thence he determined to carrie him along with him for some causes, and at two daies iournie hee came to a towne called <HI>Piache,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Piache.</NOTE> by which there passed a great Riuer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Riu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> The Gouernour demanded canoes of the Indians: they

<P>From the Port <HI>de Spirito Santo</HI> to <HI>Apalache,</HI> which is about an hundred leagues, the Gouernour went from East to West: And from <HI>Apalache</HI> to <HI>Cutifa-chi∣qui,</HI> which are 430. leagues, from the Southwest to the Northeast: and from <HI>Cutifa-chiqui</HI> to <HI>Xualla,</HI> which are about two hundred and fiftie leagues, from the South to the North: And from <HI>Xualla</HI> to <HI>Tascaluca,</HI> which are two hundred and fiftie leagues more, an hundred and ninetie of them he trauelled from East to West, to wit, to the Prouince of <HI>Coça:</HI> and the other 60. from <HI>Coça</HI> to <HI>Tascaluca</HI> from the North to the South.</P>
<P>Hauing passed the Riuer of <HI>Piache,</HI> a Christian went from his companie from thence to seeke a woman slaue that was runne away from him, and the Indians either tooke him captiue, or slue him.

The Cacique sent an In∣dian from thence to <HI>Mauilla,</HI> whither they were tra∣uelling, which was a towne of a principall Indian and his subiect, saying, that he sent him to aduise them to make readie victuals, and men for carriages. But, (as afterward appeared) hee sent him to assemble all the men of warre thither, that hee had in his Countrie.

The Gouernour came running out of the towne, cry∣ing out, that euery man should stand farther off, be∣cause from the wall they did them much hurt. The In∣dians seeing that the Christians retired, and some of them, or the most part, more then an ordinary pase, shot with great boldnesse at them, and strooke downe such as they could ouertake. The Indians which the Chri∣stians did lead with them in chaines, had laid downe their burthens neere vnto the wall: and assoone as the Gouernour and his men were retired, the men of <HI>Ma∣uilla</HI> laid them on the Indians backs againe, and tooke them into the towne, and loosed them presently from their chaines, and gaue them bowes and arrowes to fight withall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Al the clothes and perles of the Christians were lost.</NOTE> Thus they possessed themselues of al the clothes and perles, and all that the Christians had, which their slaues carried.

The Indians being become Masters of the place, they shut the doore with a field gate: and among them was one sword which the Gouernours seruant had, and with it he set himselfe behind the doore, thrusting at the Indi∣ans which sought to come into them: and the Frier and the Priest stood on the other side, each of them with a barre in their hands to beate him downe that first came in.

The Frier and the Priest, and those that were with them in the house were saued, which cost the liues of two men of account, and valiant, which came thither to succour them. The Indians fought with such courage, that many times they draue our men out of the towne. The fight lasted so long, that for wearinesse and great thirst
<PB N="78" REF="44"/> many of the Christians went to a poole that was neere the wal, to drink, which was all stained with the blood of the dead, and then came againe to fight. The Go∣uernour seeing this, entred among the footemen into the towne on horseback, with certaine that accompa∣nied him, and was a meane that the Christians came to set fire on the houses, and brake and ouercame the In∣dians, who running out of the towne from the foote∣men, the horsemen without draue in at the gates again, where being without all hope of life, they fought vali∣antly, &amp; after the Christians came among thē to han∣dy blowes, seeing themselues in great distresse without any succour, many of them fled into the burning hou∣ses, where one vpon another they were smothered and burnt in the fire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of 2500.

He staied in <HI>Mauilla,</HI> because of the wounded men, eight and twentie daies; all which time he lay in the field. It was a well inhabited and a fat Countrie, there were some great &amp; walled townes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great and walled townes</NOTE> and many houses scattered all about the fields, to wit, a crossebow shot or two, the one from the other.

<PB N="80" REF="45"/> departed from <HI>Mauilla.</HI> Euery one furnished him∣selfe with Maiz for two daies, and they trauelled fiue daies through a desert: they came to a Prouince called <HI>Pafallaya,</HI> vnto a towne, named <HI>Taliepataua:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Taliepataua.</NOTE> and from thence they went to another, called <HI>Cabusto:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabusto.</NOTE> neere vn∣to it ran a great Riuer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Riuer.</NOTE> The Indians on the other side cried out, threatning the Christians to kill them, if they sought to passe it. The Gouernour commanded his men to make a barge within the towne, because the In∣dians should not perceiue it: it was finished in foure daies, and being ended, he commanded it to be carried one night vpon sleds halfe a league vp the Riuer. In the morning there entred into it thirtie men well ar∣med. The Indians perceiued what was attempted, and those which were neerest, came to defend the pas∣sage. They resisted what they could, till the Christi∣ans came neere them; and seeing that the barge came to the shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Canauarales.</NOTE> they fled away into the groues of canes.

This Countrie was very well peopled, and the houses scat∣tered like those of <HI>Mauilla,</HI> fat and plentifull of Maiz, and the most part of it was fielding: they gathered as much as sufficed to passe the winter. Some Indians were taken, among which was one whom the Caci∣que esteemed greatly. The Gouernour sent an Indi∣an to signifie to the Cacique, that he desired to see him and to haue his friendship. The Cacique came vnto him, to offer him his person, Countrie and subiects, and told him, that he would cause two other Caciques to come to him in peace; who within few daies after came with him, and with their Indians: The one was called <HI>Alimamu,</HI> the other <HI>Nicalasa.</HI> They gaue a pre∣sent vnto the Gouernour of an hundred and fiftie co∣nies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conies.</NOTE> and of the Countrie garments, to wit, of mantles and skinnes. The Cacique of <HI>Chicaça</HI> came to visit him many times; and sometimes the Gouernour sent to call him, and sent him an horse to goe and come. He complained vnto him, that a subiect of his was risen a∣gainst him and depriued him of his tribute, requesting his aide against him, for hee meant to seeke him in his Countrie, and to punish him according to his desert.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Indian stratageme.</NOTE> Which was nothing els but a fained plot. For they de∣termined, assoone as the Gouernour was gone with him, and the Campe was diuided into two parts, the one part of them to set vpon the Gouernour, and the other vpon them that remained in <HI>Chicaça.</HI> Hee went to the towne where he vsed to keepe his residence, and
<PB N="82" REF="46"/> brought with him two hundred Indians with their bowes and arrowes. The Gouernour tooke thirtie horsemen, and eightie footemen, and they went to <HI>Sa∣quechuma</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saquechuma.</NOTE> (for so was the Prouince called of that chiefe man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A walled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wne.</NOTE> which he said had rebelled.) They found a wal∣led towne, without any men: and those which went with the Cacique set fire on the houses, to dissemble their treason. But by reason of the great care and heed∣fulness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that was as well in the Gouernours people which hee carried with him, as of those which remai∣ned in <HI>Chicaça,</HI> they durst not assault them at that time. The Gouernour inuited the Cacique, and certaine principall Indians, and gaue them hogges flesh to eate. And though they did not commonly vse it, yet they were so greedie of it, that euery night there came Indi∣ans to certaine houses a crossebow shot from the Camp, where the hogges lay, and killed, and carried away as many as they could. And three Indians were taken in the manner. Two of them the Gouernor com∣manded to be shot to death with arrowes; &amp; to cut off the hands of the other, &amp; he sent him so handled to the Cacique. Who made as though it grieued him y<SUP>t</SUP> they had offended the Gouernor, and that he was glad that he had executed that punishment on them. He lay in a plaine Countrie halfe a league from the place, where the Christians lodged. Foure horsemen went a strag∣ling thither, to wit, <HI>Francisco Osorio,</HI> and a seruant of the Marques of <HI>Astorga,</HI> called <HI>Reynoso,</HI> and two seruants of the Gouernour, the one his page called <HI>Ribera,</HI> and the other <HI>Fuentes</HI> his Chamberlaine: and these had taken from the Indians some skinnes, and some man∣tles, wherewith they were offended, and forsooke their houses. The Gouernour knew of it, and commanded
<PB N="83" REF="46"/> them to bee apprehended; and condemned to death <HI>Franscisco Osorio,</HI> and the Chamberlaine as principals, and al of them to losse of goods. The Friers and Priests and other principall persons were earnest with him to pardon <HI>Francisco Osorio</HI> his life, &amp; to moderate his sen∣tence, which hee would not grant for any of them. While he was readie to command them to be drawne to the market place to cut off their heads, there came certaine Indians from the Cacique to complaine of them. <HI>Iohn Ortiz,</HI> at the request of <HI>Baltasar de Gallegos</HI> and other persons, changed their words, and told the Gouernour, that the Cacique said, he had notice how his Lordship held those Christians in prison for his sake, and that they were in no fault, neither had they done him any wrong, and that if he would do him any fauour, he should set them free. And he told the Indi∣ans; That the Gouernour said, he had them in prison, and that he would punish them in such sort, that they should bee an example to others. Hereupon the Go∣uernour commanded the prisoners to be loosed. As∣soone as March was come, hee determined to depart from <HI>Chicaça,</HI> and demanded of the Cacique two hun∣dred men for cariages. He sent him answere, that hee would speake with his principall men. Vpon Twes∣day the eight of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March, 1541.</NOTE> the Gouernour went to the towne where he was, to aske him for the men: Hee told him, he would send them the next day. Assoone as the Gouernour was come to <HI>Chicaça,</HI> he told <HI>Luys de Moscoso</HI> the Camp-master, that hee misliked the Indi∣ans, and that he should keepe a strong watch that night, which hee remembred but a little. The Indians came at the second watch in foure squadrons, euery one by it selfe, and assoone as they were descried, they soun∣ded
<PB N="84" REF="47"/> a drum, and gaue the assault with a great cry, and with so great celeritie, that presently they entred with the scoutes, that were somewhat distant from the Campe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chicaça set on fire by the Indians.</NOTE> And when they were perceiued of them which were in the towne, halfe the houses were on fire, which they had kindled. That night three horse∣men chanced to bee skouts, two of them were of base calling, and the worst men in all the Camp, and the o∣ther, which was a nephew of the Gouernour, which vntill then was held for a tall man, shewed himselfe there as great a coward, as any of them: for all of them ran away. And the Indians without any resistance came and set the towne on fire; and taried without behind the doores for the Christians, which ran out of the houses, not hauing any leasure to arme themselues; and as they ran hither and thither amazed with the noise, and blinded with the smoke &amp; flame of the fire, they knew not which way they went, neither could they light vpon their weapons, nor saddle their hor∣ses, neither saw they the Indians that shot at them. Ma∣nie of the horses were burned in the stables, and those which could breake their halters gat loose. The disor∣der and flight was such, that euery man fled which way he could, without leauing any to resist the Indians. But God, (which chastiseth his according to his pleasure, and in the greatest necessities and dangers sustaineth them with his hand,) so blinded the Indians, that they saw not what they had done, and thought that the hor∣ses which ran loose, were men on horsebacke, that ga∣thered themselues together to set vpon them. The Go∣uernour only rod on horsebacke, and with him a soul∣dier called <HI>Tapia,</HI> and set vpon the Indians, and striking the first he met with his lance, the saddle fell with him,
<PB N="85" REF="47"/> which with haste was euill girded, and so hee fell from his horse. And all the people that were on foote were fled to a wood out of the towne, and there assembled themselues together. And because it was night, and that the Indians thought the horses were men on horsebacke which came to set vpon them, as I said be∣fore, they fled; and one onely remained dead, and that was he whom the Gouernour slew with his lance. The towne lay all burnt to ashes. There was a woman bur∣ned, who, after shee and her husband were both gone out of their house, went in againe for certaine perles, which they had forgotten, and when she would haue come out, the fire was so great at the doore that shee could not, neither could her husband succour her. O∣ther three Christians came out of their lodgings so cruelly burned, that one of them died within three daies, and the other two were carried many daies each of them vpon a couch betweene staues, which the In∣dians carried on their shoulders, for otherwise they could not trauell. There died in this hurliburlie eleuen Christians, and fiftie horses; and there remained an hundred hogges, and foure hundred were burned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The increase of hogges.</NOTE> If any perchance had saued any clothes from the fire of <HI>Mauilla,</HI> here they were burned, and many were clad in skinnes, for they had no leasure to take their coates.

Some inuented the wea∣uing of certaine mats of drie iuie, &amp; did weare one be∣neath, and another aboue: many laughed at this de∣uice, whom afterward necessitie inforced to doe the like. The Christians were so spoiled, and in such want

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Pon Wednesday the 15. of March 1541. after the Gouernour had lodged 8. daies in a plaine, halfe a league from the place which he had wintered in, after he had set vp a forge, and tempered the swords which in <HI>Chicaça</HI> were burned, and made many targets, saddles, and lan∣ces, on Tuesday night, at the morning watch, many In∣dians came to assault the Campe in three squadrons, euery one by themselues: Those which watched gaue the alarme. The Gouernour with great speed set his men in order in other three squadrons, and leauing some to defend the Campe, went out to incounter them. The Indians were ouercome and put to flight. The ground was champion and fit for y<SUP>e</SUP> Christians to take the aduantage of them; and it was now breake of day. But there happened a disorder, whereby there were not past thirtie or fortie Indians slaine: and this it was: that a Frier cried out in the Campe without
<PB N="87" REF="48"/> any iust occasion, To the Campe, To the Campe: Whereupon the Gouernour and all the rest repaired thither, and the Indians had time to saue themselues. There were some taken, by whom the Gouernour in∣formed himselfe of the Countrie, through which hee was to passe. The 25. of Aprill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25. of Aprill.</NOTE> he departed from <HI>Chi∣caça,</HI> and lodged at a small towne called <HI>Alimamu.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alimamu.</NOTE> They had very little Maiz, and they were to passe a de∣sert of seuen daies iournie. The next day, the Gouer∣nour sent three Captaines euerie one his way with horsemen and footemen to seeke prouision to passe the desert. And <HI>Iohn Dannusco</HI> the Auditor went with fifteene horsemen, and 40. footemen that way that the Gouernour was to goe, and found a strong fort made, where the Indians staied for him, and many of them walked on the top of it with their weapons, hauing their bodies, thighes and armes okered and died with blacke, white, yellow and red, striped like vnto panes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blacke, white, yellow and red colours.</NOTE> so that they shewed as though they went in hose and doublets: and some of them had plumes, and others had hornes on their heads, and their faces blacke, and their eies done round about with strakes of red, to seeme more fierce. Assoone as they saw that the Chri∣stians approched, with a great crie sounding two drummes with great furie they sallied foorth to re∣ceiue them. <HI>Iohn Dannusco</HI> and those that were with him, thought good to auoid them, and to acquaint the Gouernour therewith. They retired to a plaine place, a crossebow shot from the fort in sight of it, the foote∣men, the crossebowmen, and targetters placed them∣selues before the horsemen, that they might not hurt the horses. The Indians sallied out by seuen and seuen, and eight and eight to shoote their arrowes, and reti∣red
<PB N="88" REF="49"/> againe: and in sight of the Christians they made a fire, and tooke an Indian, some by the feete, and some by the head, and made as though they went to cast him into the fire, and gaue him first many knocks on the head: signifying, that they meant so to handle the Christians. <HI>Iohn Danusco</HI> sent three horsemen to aduer∣tise the Gouernour hereof. He came presently: for his intent was to driue them from thence, saying, that if he did it not, they would be emboldned to charge him a∣nother time, when they might doe him more harme. He made the horsemen to alight, and set his men in foure squadrons: The signe being giuen, they set vp-the Indians, which made resistance till the Christians came neere the fort, and assoone as they saw they could not defend thēselues, by a place where a brooke passed neere the fort, they ran away, and from the o∣therside they shot some arrowes: and because at that instant we knew no ford for the horses to passe, they had time enough to get out of our danger. Three In∣dians were slaine there, and many Christians were hurt, whereof within few daies, there died fifteene by the way. All men thought the Gouernour to bee in fault, because he sent not to see the disposition of the place on the other side of the Riuer, and to know the passage before hee set vpon them. For with the hope they had to saue themselues by flight that way, when they saw none other meanes, they fought til they were broken, and it was an incouragement to defend them∣selues vntill then, and to offend the Christians without any danger to themselues.</P>

The Cacique sent him answere againe, that his Lordship should loose and send them to him, and that he would come to visit and serue him. The Gouernour, because his people for want of Maiz were somewhat weake and wearie, and the horses also were leane, determined to accomplish his request, to see if hee could haue peace with him, and so commanded to set free his mother and all the rest, and with louing words dismissed them and sent them to him. The next day, when the Go∣uernour expected the Cacique, there came many In∣dians

The canoe wherein the Cacique was, had a tilt ouer the sterne, and hee sate vnder the tilt; and so were other canoes of the principall Indians. And from vnder the tilt where the chiefe man sat, hee gouerned and commanded the other people. All ioyned toge∣ther, and came within a stones cast of the shore. From thence the Cacique said to the Gouernour, which walked along the Riuers side with others that waited on him, that he was come thither to visit, to honour, and to obey him; because he knew he was the greatest and mightiest Lord on the earth: therefore he would see what he would command him to doe. The Gouer∣nour yeelded him thankes, and requested him to come on shore, that they might the better communicate to∣gether.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Auing passed <HI>Rio grande,</HI> the Gouernour trauelled a league and an halfe, and came to a great towne of <HI>Aquixo,</HI> which was dis∣peopled before hee came thither.

The horsemen pursued them, and slue tenne, and took<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fifteene. And because the towne, whither the Goue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> went, was neere vnto the Riuer, he sent a Captai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith as many men as he thought sufficient to carrie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> barges vp the Ri∣uer. And because in his trauelling by land many times he went farre from the Riuer to compasse the creekes that came from it, the Indians tooke occasion to set vp∣on them of the barges, and put them in great danger, because that by reason of the great current, they durst not leaue the shore, and from the bancke they shot at
<PB N="94" REF="52"/> them. Assoone as the Gouernour was come to the towne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A towne.</NOTE> hee presently sent crossebowmen downe the Riuer, which came to rescue them: and vpon the com∣ming of the barges to the towne, hee commanded them to bee broken, and to saue the iron for others, when it should bee needfull. Hee lay there one night, and the day following, hee set forward to seeke a Pro∣uince, called <HI>Pacaha:</HI> which hee was informed to bee neere vnto <HI>Chisca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pacaha neere vnto Chisca. Great townes.</NOTE> where the Indians told him there was gold. He passed through great townes of <HI>Aquixo,</HI> which were all abandoned for feare of the Christians. Hee vnderstood by certaine Indians that were ta∣ken, that three daies iournie from thence dwelt a great Cacique, whose name was <HI>Casqui.</HI> Hee came to a small Riuer, where a bridge was made, by which they passed: that day till Sunset, they went all in wa∣ter, which in some places came to the waste, and in some to the knees. When they saw themselues on dry land, they were very glad, because they feared they should wander vp and downe as forlorne men al night in the water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first towne of Cas∣qui.</NOTE> At noone they came to the first towne of <HI>Casqui:</HI> they found the Indians carelesse, because they had no knowledge of them. There were many men and women taken, and store of goods, as mantles and skinnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another towne.</NOTE> as well in the first towne, as in another, which stood in a field halfe a league from thence in sight of it; whither the horsemen ran. This Countrie is higher, drier, and more champion, then any part bordering neere the Riuer, that vntill then they had seene. There were in the fields many Walnut trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walnut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rees with soft shels.</NOTE> bearing soft shelled Walnuts in fashion like bullets, and in the hou∣ses they found many of them, which the Indians had laid vp in store. The trees differed in nothing else from
<PB N="95" REF="52"/> those of <HI>Spaine,</HI> nor from those which we had seene be∣fore, but onely that they haue a smaller lease. There were many Mulberrie trees and Plum trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Mul∣berrie trees and plum trees.</NOTE> which bare red plums like those of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and other gray, somewhat differing, but farre better. And all the trees are all the yeere so fruitfull, as if they were planted in orchards: and the woods were verie thinne. The Go∣uernour trauelled two daies through the Countrie of <HI>Casqui,</HI> before hee came to the towne where the Caci∣que was: and the most of the way was alway by cham∣pion ground, which was full of great townes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many great townes.</NOTE> so that from one towne, you might see two or three. He sent an Indian to certifie the Cacique, that hee was com∣ming to the place where hee was, with intent to pro∣cure his friendship, and to hold him as his brother. Whereunto he answered, That he should be welcome, and that he would receiue him with speciall good wil, and accomplish all that his Lordship would command him. Hee sent him a present vpon the way; to wit, skinnes, mantles, and fish: And after these comple∣ments, the Gouernour found all the townes, as he pas∣sed, inhabited with people, which peaceablie atten∣ded his comming, and offered him skinnes, mantles, and fish. The Cacique accompanied with many Indi∣ans came out of the towne, and staied halfe a league on the way to receiue the Gouernour, and when hee came to him, he spake these words following:</P>
<P><HI>Right high, right mighty, and renowned Lord, your Lord∣ship is most hartilie welcome. Assoone as I had notice of your L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdship, of your power, and your perfections, although you came into my Countrie, killing and taking captiues the inha∣bitants thereof and my subiects: yet I determined to conforme my will vnto yours, and as your owne to interpret in good part
<PB N="96" REF="53"/> all that your Lordship did: beleeuing, that it was conuenient it should be so for some iust respect, to preuent some future mat∣ter reuealed vnto your Lordsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, and concealed from me. For well may a mischiefe be permitted to auoid a greater, and that good may come thereof: which I beleeue will so fall out. For it is no reason to presume of so excellent a Prince, that the no∣blenesse of his heart, and the effect of his will would permit him to suffer any vniust thing. My abilitie is so small to serue you as your Lordship deserueth, that if you respect not mine abundant good will, which humblie offereth all kind of seruice, I deserue but little in your presence. But if it bee rea∣son that this be esteemed, receiue the same, my selfe, my Coun∣trie, and subiects for yours, and dispose of me and them at your pleasure. For if I were Lord of all the world, with the same good will should your Lordship by me be receiued, serued and obeyed.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour answered him to the purpose, and satisfied him in few words. Within a while after both of them vsed words of great offers &amp; courtesie the one to the other, and the Cacique requested him to lodge in his houses. The Gouernour, to preserue the peace the better, excused himselfe, saying, that hee would lodge in the fields. And because it was very hot, they camped neere certaine trees a quarter of a league from the towne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chie e towne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> que o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> The Cacique went to his towne, and came againe with many Indians singing. Assoone as they came to the Gouernour, all of them prostrated them∣selues vpon the ground. Among these came two In∣dians that were blind. The Cacique made a speech: to auoid tediousnesse, I will onely tell in few words the substance of the matter. Hee said, that seeing the Go∣uernour was the sonne of the Sunne, and a great Lord, he besought him to doe him the fauour to giue sight
<PB N="97" REF="53"/> to those two blind men. The blind men rose vp pre∣sently, and very earnestly requested the same of the Gouernour. He answered, That in the high heauens was he that had power to giue them health, and what∣soeuer they could aske of him; whose seruant he was: And that this Lord made the heauens and the earth, and man after his owne likenesse, and that he suffered vpon the crosse to saue mankind, and rose againe the third day, and that he died as he was man, and as tou∣ching his diuinitie, he was, and is immortall; and that he ascended into heauen, where he standeth with his armes open to receiue all such as turne vnto him: and straightway he commanded him to make a verie high crosse of wood, which was set vp in the highest place of the towne; declaring vnto him, that the Christians worshipped the same in resemblance and memorie of that whereon Christ suffered. The Gouernour and his men kneeled downe before it, and the Indians did the like. The Gouernour willed him, that from thence∣foorth hee should worship the same, and should aske whatsoeuer they stood in need of, of that Lord that he told him was in heauen. Then he asked him how far it was from thence to <HI>Pacaha:</HI> He said, one daies iour∣nie, and that at the end of his Countrie, there was a lake like a brooke which falleth into <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> and that hee would send men before to make a bridge whereby he might passe. The same day that the Go∣uernour departed thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A towne be∣longing to Casqui. Other town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</NOTE> he lodged at a towne belon∣ging to <HI>Casqui:</HI> and the next day hee passed in sight of other townes, and came to the lake, which was halfe a crossebow shot ouer, of a great depth and current. At the time of his comming, the Indians had made an
<PB N="98" REF="54"/> end of the bridge, which was made of timber, laid one tree after another: and on one side it had a course of stakes higher then the bridge, for them that passed to take hold on. The Cacique of <HI>Casqui</HI> came to the Go∣uernour, and brought his people with him. The Go∣uernour sent word by an Indian to the Cacique of <HI>Pa∣caha,</HI> that though hee were enemie to the Cacique of Casqui, and though hee were there, yet he would doe him no disgrace nor hurt, if he would attēd him peace∣ablie, and embrace his friendship; but rather would intreate him as a brother. The Indian, which the Go∣uernour sent, came againe, and said, that the Cacique made none account of that which hee told him, but fled with all his men out at the other side of the towne. Presentlie the Gouernour entred, and ran before with the horsemen, that way, by which the Indians fled; and at another towne distant a quarter of a league from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another towne.</NOTE> they tooke many Indians: and assoone as the horsemen had taken them, they deliuered them to the Indians of <HI>Casqui,</HI> whom, because they were their ene∣mies, with much circumspection and reioycing, they brought to the towne where the Christians were: and the greatest griefe they had, was this, that they could not get leaue to kill them. There were found in the towne many mantles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mantles, Deeres skins, L ons skinnes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eares skins, and Ca s skinnes.</NOTE> and Deere skinnes, Lions skins, and Beares skinnes, and many Cats skins. Many came so farre poorely apparrelled, and there they clothed themselues: of the mantles, they made them cotes and cassocks, and some made gownes, and lined them with Cats skins; and likewise their cassocks. Of the Deeres skinnes, some made them also ierkins, shirts, hose and shooes: and of the Beare skinnes, they made them ve∣ry

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Pon Wednesday, the 19. of Iune, the Go∣uernour entred into <HI>Pacaha:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pacaha, a very great towne beset with towers.</NOTE> He lodged in the towne, where the Cacique vsed to reside, which was very great, walled, and beset with towers, and many loopeholes were in the towers and wall. And in the towne was great store of old Maiz, and great quantitie of new in the fields. Within a league and halfe a league were great townes all walled. Where the Gouernour was lodged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great walled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ownes.</NOTE> was a great lake, that came neere vnto the wall: and it en∣tred into a ditch that went round about the towne, wanting but a little to enuiron it round. From the lake to the great Riuer was made a weare by the which the fish came into it; which the Cacique kept for his recreation and sport: with nets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nets found.</NOTE> that were found in the towne, they tooke as much as they would: and tooke they neuer so much, there was no want perceiued. There was also great store of fish in many other lakes that were thereabout, but it was soft, and not so good as that which came from the Riuer, and the most of it was different from the fresh water fish of <HI>Spaine.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The diuers sorts of excel∣lent fish in Rio Grande.</NOTE> There was a fish which they called Bagres: the third part of it was head, and it had on both sides the gilles, and
<PB N="100" REF="55"/> along the sides great pricks like very sharpe aules: those of this kind that were in the lakes were as big as pikes: and in the Riuer, there were some of an hundred, and of an hundred and fiftie pounds weight, and many of them were taken with the hooke. There was another fish like barbilles; and another like breames, headed like a delicate fish, called in <HI>Spaine</HI> besugo, betweene red and gray. This was there of most esteeme. There was another fish called a pele fish: it had a snout of a cubit long, and at the end of the vpper lip it was made like a peele. There was another fish like a Westerne shad: And all of them had scales, except the bagres, and the pele fish. There was another fish, which some∣times the Indians brought vs, of the bignes of an hog, they called it the Pereo fish: it had rowes of teeth be∣neath and aboue. The Cacique of <HI>Casqui</HI> sent many times great presents of fish, mantles, and skinnes. Hee told the Gouernour, that he would deliuer the Caci∣que of <HI>Pacaha</HI> into his hands. He went to <HI>Casqui,</HI> and sent many canoes vp the Riuer, and came himselfe by land with many of his people. The Gouernour with 40. horsemen, and 60. footemen tooke him along with him vp the Riuer. And his Indians which were in the canoes, discouered where the Cacique of <HI>Pacaha</HI> was in a little Island, situated betweene two armes of the Riuer. And fiue Christians entred into a canoe, where∣in <HI>Don Antonio Osorio</HI> went before, to see what peo∣ple the Cacique had with him. There were in the Isle fiue or sixe thousand soules.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue or sixe thousand In∣dians.</NOTE> And assoone as they saw them, supposing that the Indians which were in the other canoes were also Christians, the Cacique, and certaine which were in three canoes, which they had there with thē, fled in great haste to the other side
<PB N="101" REF="55"/> of the Riuer: The rest with great feare and danger, lept into the Riuer, where much people was drowned, especially women, and little children. Presently the Gouernor which was on land, not knowing what had happened to <HI>Don Antonio,</HI> and those that went with him, commanded y<SUP>e</SUP> Christians with all speed to enter with the Indians of <HI>Casqui</HI> in the canoes, which were quickly with <HI>Don Antonio</HI> in the little Island, where they tooke many men and women, and much goods. Great store of goods, which the Indians had laid vp∣on hurdles of canes, and rafts of timber to carrie ouer to the other side, draue down the riuer, wherewith the Indians of <HI>Casqui</HI> filled their canoes: and for feare lest the Christians would take it from them, the Cacique went home with them downe the Riuer, without ta∣king his leaue of the Gouernour: whereupon the Gouernour was highly offended with him: and pre∣sently returning to <HI>Pacaha,</HI> he ouerran the Countrie of <HI>Casqui</HI> the space of two leagues, where hee tooke twentie or thirtie of his men. And because his horses were wearie, and he wanted time that day to goe any farther, hee returned to <HI>Pacaha,</HI> with determination within three or foure daies after to inuade <HI>Casqui.</HI> And presently he let loose one of the Indians of <HI>Pacaha,</HI> and sent word by him to the Cacique, that if hee would haue his friendship, he should repaire vnto him, and that both of them would make warre vpon <HI>Casqui</HI> And presently came many Indians that belonged to <HI>Pacaha,</HI> and brought an Indian, in stead of the Cacique, which was discouered by the Caciques brother which was taken prisoner. The Gouernour wished the Indi∣ans that their Master himselfe should come: for hee knew very well that that was not hee, and told them,
<PB N="102" REF="56"/> that they could doe nothing, which he knew not be∣fore they thought it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cacique o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pa a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>meth to the Gouer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</NOTE> The next day the Cacique came, accompanied with many Indians, and with a present of much fish, skinnes and mantles. He made a speech that all were glad to heare, and concluded, saying, That though his Lordship, without his giuing occasion of offence had done him hurt in his Countrie and sub∣iects, yet he would not therefore refus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to bee his, and that he would alwaies be at his commandement. The Gouernour commanded his brother to be loosed, and other principall Indians that were taken prisoners. That day came an Indian from the Cacique of <HI>Casqui,</HI> and said, that his Lord would come the next day to ex∣cuse himselfe of the error which he had committed, in going away without licence of the Gouernour. The Gouernour willed the messenger to signifie vnto him, that if he came not in his owne person, he would seeke him himselfe, and giue him such punishment as he de∣serued. The next day with all speede came the Caci∣que of <HI>Casqui,</HI> and brought a present to the Gouernour of many mantles, skinnes, and fish, and gaue him a daughter of his, saying, that he greatly desired to match his blood with the blood of so great a Lord as he was, and therefore he brought him his daughter, and desi∣red him to take her to his wife. Hee made a long and discreet oration, giuing him great commendations, and concluded, saying, that hee should pardon his go∣ing away without licence, for that Crosses sake, which he had left with him: protesting, that hee went away for shame of that which his men had done without his consent. The Gouernour answered him, that hee had chosen a good patrone; and that if he had not come to excuse himselfe, hee had determined to seeke
<PB N="103" REF="56"/> him, to burne his townes, to kill him and his people, and to destroy his Countrie. To which he replied, saying:</P>
<P><HI>My Lord, I and mine are yours, and my Countrie like∣wise is yours: therefore if you had done so, you should haue destroyed your owne Countrie, and haue killed your owne peo∣ple: whatsoeuer shall come vnto me from your hand, I will re∣ceiue as from my Lord, aswell punishment as reward: And know you, that the fauour which you did me in leauing me the Crosse, I do acknowledge the same to be a very great one, and greater then I haue euer deserued. For you shall vnderstand, that with great droughts, the fields of Maiz of my Countrie were withered; and assoone as I and my people kneeled before the Crosse, and prayed for raine, presently our necessitie was relieued.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour made him, and the Cacique of <HI>Pa∣caha</HI> friends; and set them with him at his table to dine with him: and the Caciques fell at variance a∣bout the seates, which of them should sit on his right hand. The Gouernour pacified them; telling them, that among the Christians, all was one to sit on the one side, or on the other, willing them so to behaue them∣selues, seeing they were with him, that no bodie might heare them, and that euery one should sit in the place that first hee lighted on.

The Gouernor seeing, that toward that part the Countrie was so poore of Maiz, that in it they could not bee sustained, demanded of the Indians, which way it was most inhabited: and they said, they had notice of a great Prouince, and a very plentifull Countrie, which was called <HI>Quigaute,</HI> and that it was toward the South.</P>

There came an Indian very well accompanied with many Indians, saying, that hee was the Cacique. He deliuered him ouer to the men of his guard to look vnto him. There went and came many Indians, and brought mantles and skinnes. The counterfeit Caci∣que, seeing so little opportunitie to execute his euill thought, as hee went one day abroad talking with the Gouernour, he shewed him such a paire of heeles, that there was no Christian that could ouertake him, and he leaped into the Riuer, which was a crossebow shot from the towne: and assoone as hee was on the other side, many Indians that were thereabout making a great crie began to shoote.

Vntill that time the Christians wanted salt, and there they made good store, which they carried along with them. The Indians doe carrie it to other places
<PB N="110" REF="60"/> to exchange it for skinnes and mantles. They make it along the Riuer, which when it ebbeth, leaueth it vp∣on the vpper part of the sand. And because they can∣not make it, without much sand mingled with it, they throw it into certaine baskets which they haue for that purpose, broad at the mouth, and narrow at the bottom, and set it in the aire vpon a barre, and throw water into it, and set a small vessell vnder it, wherein it falleth: Being strained and set to boile vpon the fire, when the water is sodden away, the salt remaineth in the bottome of the pan. On both sides of the Riuer the Countrie was full of sowne fields, and there was store of Maiz. The Indians durst not come ouer where wee were: &amp; when some of them shewed themselues, the souldiers that saw them called vnto them; then the In∣dians passed the Riuer, and came with them where the Gouernor was. He asked thē for the Cacique. They said, that he remained quiet, but that he durst not shew himselfe. The Gouernour presently sent him word, that he should come vnto him, and bring him a guide and an interpretour for his iournie, if he made account of his friendship: and if he did not so, he would come himselfe to seeke him, and that it would bee the worse for him. Hee waited three daies, and seeing he came not, he went to seeke him, and brought him prisoner with 150. of his men. He asked him, whether hee had notice of any great Cacique, &amp; which way the Coun∣trie was best inhabited. Hee answered, that the best Countrie thereabout was a Prouince toward the South, a day and an halfes iournie, which was called <HI>Tulla;</HI> and that he could giue him a guide, but no in∣terpretour, because the speech of that Countrie was different from his, and because he and his ancestors
<PB N="111" REF="60"/> had alwaies warres with the Lords of that Prouince; therefore they had no commerce, nor vnderstood one anothers language. Immediatly the Gouernour with certaine horsemen, and 50. footemen, departed to∣ward <HI>Tulla,</HI> to see if the Countrie were such, as hee might passe through it with all his companie: and as∣soone as he arriued there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tulla.</NOTE> and was espied of the Indi∣ans, the Countrie gathered together, and assoone as 15. and 20. Indians could assemble themselues, they set vpon the Christians: and seeing that they did han∣dle them shrewdly, and that the horsemen ouertooke them when they fled, they gat vp into the tops of their houses, and sought to defend themselues with their ar∣rowes: and being beaten downe from one, they gat vp vpon another. And while our men pursued some, others set vpon them another way. Thus the skirmish lasted so long, that the horses were tired, and they could not make them runne. The Indians killed there one horse, and some were hurt. There were 15. Indi∣ans slaine there, and 40. women and boies were taken prisoners. For whatsoeuer Indian did shoot at them, if they could come by him, they put him to the sword. The Gouernour determined to returne toward <HI>Cayas,</HI> before the Indians had time to gather a head; and presently that euening, going part of y<SUP>e</SUP> night to leaue <HI>Tulla,</HI> he lodged by the way, and the next day came to <HI>Cayas:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gouer∣nor commeth againe to Tul∣la with all his companie.</NOTE> and within three daies after he departed thēce toward <HI>Tulla</HI> with all his companie: He carried the Cacique along with him, and among all his men, there was not one found that could vnderstand the speech of <HI>Tulla.</HI> He staied three daies by the way, and the day that he came thither, he found the towne abando∣ned: for the Indians durst not tarrie his comming.

The next day they saw many canoes come vp the Riuer, and on the other side of the great Riuer, they assembled together in the space of an houre: they con∣sulted whether they should come or not; &amp; at length concluded to come, and crossed the Riuer. In thē came the Cacique of <HI>Guachoya,</HI> and brought with him ma∣nie Indians with great store of Fish, Dogges, Deeres skinnes, and Mantles: And assoone as they landed, they went to the lodging of the Gouernour, and pre∣sented him their gifts, and the Cacique vttered these words:</P>
<P><HI>Mightie and excellent Lord, I beseech your Lordship to pardon mee the errour which I committed in absenting my selfe, and not tarrying in this towne to haue receiued and ser∣ued your Lordship; since, to obtaine this opportunitie of time, was, and is as mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h as a great v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rie to me. But I feared that, which I needed not to haue feared, and so did that which was not reason to do: But as haste maketh waste and I remo∣ued without deliberation; so, as soone as I thought on it, I determined not to follow the opinion of the foolish, which is, to continue in their errour; but to imitate the wise and discreet, in changing my counsell, and so I came to see what your Lord∣ship will command me to doe, that I may serue you in all things that are in my power.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour receiued him with much ioy, and gaue him thankes for his present and offer. He a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked him, whether hee had any notice of the Sea. Hee an∣swered, no, nor of any townes downe the Riuer on that side; saue that two leagues from thence was one towne of a principall Indian a subiect of his; and on
<PB N="124" REF="67"/> the other side of the Riuer, three daies iourney from thence downe the Riuer, was the Prouince of <HI>Qui∣galta,</HI> which was the greatest Lord that was in that Countrie. The Gouernour thought that the Cacique lied vnto him, to rid him out of his owne townes, and sent <HI>Iohn Danusco</HI> with eight horsemen downe the Ri∣uer, to see what habitation there was, and to informe himselfe, if there were any notice of the Sea. Hee tra∣uelled eight daies, and at his returne hee said, that in all that time he was not able to go aboue 14 or 15 leagues, because of the great creekes that came out of the Ri∣uer, and groues of canes, and thicke woods that were along the bancks of the Riuer, and that hee had found no habitation. The Gouernour fell into great dumps to see how hard it was to get to the Sea: and worse, be∣cause his men and horses euery day diminished, being without succour to sustaine themselues in the country: and with that thought he fell sick.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gouer∣nor falleth sick of thought.</NOTE> But before he tooke his bed hee sent an Indian to the Cacique of <HI>Quigalta</HI> to tell him, that hee was the Childe of the Sunne, and that all the way that hee came all men obeyed and ser∣ued him, that he requested him to accept of his friend∣ship, and come vnto him; for he would be very glad to see him; and in signe of loue and obedience to bring something with him of that which in his countrie was most esteemed. The Cacique answered by the same Indian:</P>
<P><HI>That whereas he said he was the Child of the Sunne, if he would drie vp the Riuer he would beleeue him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A most wittie and st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>were of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>que <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>galta.</NOTE> and touching the rest, that hee was wont to visit none; but rather that all those of whom he had notice did visit him, serued, obeyed and paid him tributes willingly or perforce: therefore if hee desi∣red to see him, it were best he should come thither: that if hee
<PB N="125" REF="67"/> came in peace, he would receiue him with speciall goodwill; and if in warre, in like manner hee would attend him in the towne where he was, and that for him or any other hee would not shrinke one foote backe.</HI></P>
<P>By that time the Indian returned with this answere, the Gouernour had betaken himselfe to bed, being euill handled with feuers, and was much aggrieued, that he was not in case to passe presently the Riuer and to seeke him, to see if he could abate that pride of his, considering the Riuer went now very strongly in those parts; for it was neere halfe a league broad, and 16. fa∣thomes deep, and very furious, and ranne with a great current; and on both sides there were many Indians, and his power was not now so great, but that hee had need to helpe himselfe rather by slights then by force. The Indians of <HI>Guachoya</HI> came euery day with fish in such numbers, that the towne was full of them. The Cacique said, that on a certaine night hee of <HI>Quigalta</HI> would come to giue battell to the Gouernour. Which the Gouernour imagined that he had deuised, to driue him out of his countrey, and commanded him to bee put in hold: and that night and all the rest, there was good watch kept. Hee asked him wherefore <HI>Quigalta</HI> came not? He said that hee came, but that he saw him prepared, and therfore durst not giue the attempt: and hee was earnest with him to send his Captaines ouer the Riuer, and that he would aide him with many men to set vpon <HI>Quigalta.</HI> The Gouernour told him that assoone as he was recouered, himselfe would seeke him out. And seeing how many Indians came daily to the towne, and what store of people was in that countrie, fearing they should al conspire together and plot some treason against him; and because the towne had some
<PB N="126" REF="68"/> open gaps which were not made an end of inclosing, besides the gates which they went in and out by: be∣cause the Indians should not thinke he feared them, he let them all a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one vnrepaired; and commanded the horsemen to be appointed to them, and to the gates: and all night the horsemen went the round; and two and two of euery squadron rode about, and visited the skouts that were without the towne in their standings by the passages, and the crossebowmen that kept the canoes in the Riuer. And because the Indians should stand in feare of them, hee determined to send a Cap∣taine to <HI>Nilco,</HI> for those of <HI>Guachoya</HI> had told him that it was inhabited; that by vsing them cruelly, neither the one nor the other should presume to assaile him; and hee sent <HI>Nunnez de Touar</HI> with fifteene horsemen, and <HI>Iohn de Guzman</HI> Captaine of the footmen with his companie in canoes vp the Riuer. The Cacique of <HI>Guach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ya</HI> sent for many canoes and many warlike In∣dians to goe with the Christians: and the Captaine of the Christians, called <HI>Nunnez de Tou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> went by land with his horsemen, and two leagues before he came to <HI>Nilco</HI> hee staied for <HI>Iohn de Guzman,</HI> and in that place they passed the Riuer by night: the horsemen came first, and in the morning by breake of day in sight of the towne they lighted vpon a spie; which assoone as he perceiued the Christians, crying out amaine fled to the towne to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue warning. <HI>Nunnez de Touar</HI> and his companie made such speed, that before the Indians of the towne could fully come out, they were vpon them: it was chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ground that was inhabited, which was about a quarter of a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ague. There were about fiue or sixe thousand people in the towne:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> and, as many people came out of the houses, &amp; fled from one house
<PB N="127" REF="68"/> to another, and many Indians came flocking together from all parts, there was neuer a horseman that was not alone among many. The Captaine had commanded that they should not spare the life of any male. Their disorder was so great, that there was no Indian that shot an arrow at any Christian. The shreekes of wo∣men and children were so great, that they made the eares deafe of those that followed them. There were slaine an hundred Indians, little more or lesse: and ma∣ny were wounded with great wounds, whom they suffered to escape to strike a terror in the rest that were not there. There were some so cruell and butcherlike, that they killed old and young, and all that they met, though they made no resistance: and those which pre∣sumed of themselues for their valour, and were taken for such, brake through the Indians, bearing downe many with their stirrops and brests of their horses; and some they wounded with their lances, and so let them goe: and when they saw any youth or woman they tooke them, and deliuered them to the footmen. These mens sinnes by Gods permission lighted on their own heads who, because they would seeme valiant, became cruell; shewing themselues extreme cowards in the sight of all men, when as most neede of valour was re∣quired, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Chap. 37.</NOTE> afterward they came to a shameful death. Of the Indians of <HI>Nilco</HI> were taken prisoners, foure∣score women and children, and much spoile. The In∣dians of <HI>Guachoya</HI> kept back before they came at the towne, and staied without, beholding the successe of the Christians with the men of <HI>Nilco.</HI> And when they saw them put to flight, and the horsemen busie in kil∣ling of them, they hastened to the houses to rob, and filled their canoes with the spoile of the goods; and re∣turned
<PB N="128" REF="69"/> to <HI>Guachoya</HI> before the Christians; and won∣dring much at the sharpe dealing which they had seene them vse toward the Indians of <HI>Nilco,</HI> they told their Cacique all that had passed with great astonish∣ment.</P>

<P><HI>Baltasar de Gallegos</HI> answered in the name of all the rest: And first of all comforting him, he set before his eies how short the life of this world was, and with how many troubles and miseries it is accompanied, and how God shewed him a singular fauor which soonest left it: telling him many other things fit for such a time. And for the last point, that since it pleased God to take him to himselfe, although his death did iustly grieue them much, yet as wel he, as al the rest, ought of neces∣sitie to conforme themselues to the will of God. And touching the Gouernour which he commanded they should elect, he besought him, that it would please his Lordship to name him which he thought fit, and him they would obey. And presently he named <HI>Luys de Moscoso de Aluarado</HI> his Captaine generall. And pre∣sently he was sworne by all that were present and ele∣cted for Gouernour. The next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of Don Ferdi∣nando de Soto the 21. of May, 1542 at Gua∣coya.</NOTE> being the 21. of May, 1542. departed out of this life, the valorous, vir∣tuous, and valiant Captaine, <HI>Don Fernando de Soto,</HI> Go∣uernour of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and Adelantado of <HI>Florida:</HI> whom fortune aduanced, as it vseth to doe others, that hee might haue the higher fal. He departed in such a place, and at such a time, as in his sicknesse he had but little comfort: and the danger wherein all his people were
<PB N="130" REF="70"/> of perishing in that Countrie, which appeared before their eies, was cause sufficient, why euery one of them had need of comfort, and why they did not visit nor accompanie him as they ought to haue done. <HI>Luys de Moscoso</HI> determined to conceale his death from the In∣dians, because <HI>Ferdinando de Soto</HI> had made them be∣leeue, That the Christians were immortall; and also because they tooke him to be hardie, wise, and valiant: and if they should know that he was dead, they would bee bold to set vpon the Christians, though they liued peaceablie by them. In regard of their disposition, and because they were nothing constant, and beleeued all that was tolde them, the Adelantado made them be∣leeue, that he knew some things that passed in secret a∣mong themselues, without their knowledge, how, or in what manner he came by them: and that the figure which appeared in a glasse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣tagem.</NOTE> which he shewed them, did tell him whatsoeuer they practised and went about: and therefore neither in word nor deed durst they at∣tempt any thing that might bee preiudiciall vnto him.</P>
<P>Assoone as he was dead, <HI>Luis de Moscoso</HI> commanded to put him secretly in an house, where hee remained three daies: and remoouing him from thence, com∣manded him to bee buried in the night at one of the gates of the towne within the wall. And as the Indians had seene him sick, and missed him, so did they suspect what might bee. And passing by the place where hee was buried, seeing the earth mooued, they looked and spake one to another. <HI>Luys de Moscoso</HI> vnderstanding of it, commanded him to be taken vp by night, and to cast a great deale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d into the mantles, wherein he was winded vp, wherein hee was carried in a canoe,
<PB N="131" REF="70"/> and throwne into the middest of the Riuer. The Ca∣cique of <HI>Guachoya</HI> inquired for him, demanding what was become of his brother and Lord, the Gouernour: <HI>Luys de Moscoso</HI> told him, that hee was gon to heauen, as many other times hee did: and because hee was to stay there certaine daies, hee had left him in his place. The Cacique thought with himselfe that he was dead; and cōmanded two young and well proportioned In∣dians to be brought thither; and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is also the custome of the old Tar∣tars.</NOTE> that y<SUP>e</SUP> vse of that Countrie was, when any Lord died, to kill Indians to wait vpon him, and serue him by the way: and for that purpose by his commandement were those come thither: and prayed <HI>Luys de Moscoso</HI> to command them to be beheaded, that they might attend and serue his Lord and brother. <HI>Luys de Moscoso</HI> told him, that the Gouernour was not dead, but gone to heauen, and that of his owne Christian souldiers, he had taken such as he needed to serue him, &amp; praied him to command those Indians to be loosed, and not to vse any such bad custome from thencefoorth: straightway hee com∣manded them to be loosed, and to get them home to their houses. And one of them would not goe; saying, that hee would not serue him, that without desert had iudged him to death, but that hee would serue him as long as hee liued, which had saued his life.</P>
<P><HI>Luys de Moscoso</HI> caused all the goods of the Gouernor to be sold at an outcrie: to wit, two men slaues, &amp; two women slaues, and three horses, and 700 hogges.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seuen hun∣dred hogges.</NOTE> For euery slaue or horse, they gaue two or three thousand ducats: which were to be paied at the first melting of gold or siluer, or at the diuision of their portion of in∣heritance.

The Gouernour comman∣ded the Captaines and principall persons to meet to consult and determine what they should doe. And being informed what peopled habitation was round about, he vnderstood that to the West, the Countrie was most inhabited, and that downe the Riuer beyond <HI>Quigalta</HI> was vninhabited, and had little store of food
<PB N="133" REF="71"/> He desired them all, that euerie one would giue his o∣pinion in writing, &amp; set his hand to it: that they might resolue by generall consent, whether they should goe downe the Riuer, or enter into the maine land. All were of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their general resolution to trauell by land West∣ward.</NOTE> that it was best to go by land toward the West, because <HI>Nueua Espanna</HI> was that way; hol∣ding the voyage by sea more dangerous, and of grea∣ter hazard, because they could make no ship of any strength to abide a storme, neither had they Master, nor Pilot, Compasse, nor Chart, neither knew they how farre the sea was off, nor had any notice of it; nor whe∣ther the Riuer did make any great turning into the land, or had any great fall from the rocks, where all of them might be cast away. And some which had seene the sea-chart, did find, that from the place where they were by the sea coast to <HI>Noua Espanna,</HI> might bee 400. leagues, little more or lesse; and said, that though they went somewhat about by land in seeking a peopled Countrie, if some great wildernesse which they could not passe did not hinder thē, by spending that sommer in trauell, finding prouision to passe the winter in some peopled Countrie, that the next sommer after they might come to some Christian land, and that it might fortune in their trauel by land to find some rich Coun∣trie, where they might doe themselues good. The Gouernour, although he desired to get out of <HI>Florida</HI> in shorter time, seeing the inconueniences they laid before him, in trauelling by sea, determined to follow that which seemed good to them all.

Presently the Cacique came vnto him, and brought a great present of mantles and skinnes, and the Christi∣an that was lost, and made this speech following:</P>
<P><HI>Right excellent Lord, I would not deserue that conceit which you had of me, for all the treasure of the world.

What then could be the cause, I hauing receiued fauours of him, and nei∣ther you nor he hauing done me any wrong, that should mooue me to doe the thing, which I ought not? Beleeue this of mee, that neither wrong, nor any worldly interest, was able to make me to haue done it, nor shall be able to blind me. But as in this life it is a naturall course, that after one pleasure, many sorrewes doe follow: so by your ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnation, fortune would moderate the ioy, which my heart conceiueth with your pre∣sence; and that I should erre, where I thought surest to haue hit the marke; in harboring this Christian which was lost, and vsing him in such manner, as he may tell himselfe, thin∣king that herein I did you seruice, with purpose to deliuer him
<PB N="135" REF="72"/> vnto you in</HI> Chaguate, <HI>and to serue you to the vttermost of my power. If I deserue punishment for this, I will receiue it at your hands, as from my Lord, as if it were a fauour. For the loue which I did beare to the excellent Gouernour, and which I beare to you hath no limit. And like as you giue me chastisement, so will you also shew me fauour. And that which now I craue of you is this, to declare your will vnto me, and those things, wherein I may bee able to doe you the most and best seruice.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernour answered him, that because he did not find him in that towne, hee was incensed against him, thinking he had absented himselfe, as others had done: But seeing he now knew his loyaltie and loue, he would alwaies hold him as a brother, and fauour him in all his affaires. The Cacique went with him to the towne where he resided, which was a daies iournie from thence. They passed through a smal town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A smal towne.</NOTE> where there was a lake, where the Indians made salt:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt made of salt springs of water.</NOTE> and the Christians made some one day while they rested there, of a brackish water, which sprang neere the towne in ponds like fountaines. The Gouernour stai∣ed in <HI>Chaguate</HI> sixe daies. There he was informed of the habitation that was toward the West. They told him, that three daies iournie from thence was a Pro∣uince called <HI>Aguacay.</HI> The day that he departed from <HI>Chaguate,</HI> a Christian, called <HI>Francisco de Guzman,</HI> the base sonne of a Gentleman of <HI>Siuill,</HI> staied behind, and went to the Indians, with an Indian woman which he kept as his concubine, for feare he should be punished for gaming debts, that he did owe.

<PB N="137" REF="73"/> and <HI>Naguatex</HI> along the corner of a groue of very faire trees. In the same place certaine Indians were discouered, which came to view them. The horsemen went out to them, and killed six, and tooke two; whom the Gouernour asked, wherefore they came? They said, to know what people hee had, and what order they kept; and that the Cacique of <HI>Naguatex</HI> their Lord had sent them, and that he, with other Caciques which came to aide him, determined that day to bid him battell. While they were occupied in these que∣stions and answeres, there came many Indians by two waies in two squadrons: and when they saw they were descried, giuing a great crie they assaulted the Christians each squadron by it selfe: but seeing what resistance the Christians made them, they turned their backes and betooke themselues to flight, in which ma∣ny of them lost their liues; and most of the horsemen following them in chase, carelesse of the Camp, other two squadrons of Indians, which lay in ambush, set vp∣on the Christians that were in the Campe, which also they resisted, who also had their reward as the first. Af∣ter the flight of the Indians, and that the Christians were retired, they heard a great noise a crossebow shot from the place where they were. The Gouernour sent twelue horsemen to see what it was. They found sixe Christians, foure footmen and two horsemen, among many Indians; the horsemen defending the footmen with great labour. These being of them that chased the first two squadrons, had lost themselues, and comming to recouer the Campe fell among those with whom they were fighting: and so they, and those that came to succour thē, slew many of the Indians, and brought one aliue to the Campe: whom the Gouernour exa∣mined,
<PB N="138" REF="74"/> who they were that came to bid him battell. He told him, that they were the Cacique of <HI>Naguatex,</HI> and of <HI>Amaye,</HI> and another of a prouince called <HI>Haca∣nac,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hacanac.</NOTE> a Lord of great countries and many subiects; and that the Cacique of <HI>Naguatex</HI> came for Captaine and chiefest of them all. The Gouernour commanded his right arme and nose to be cut off, and sent him to the Cacique of <HI>Naguatex,</HI> charging him to tell him, that the next day hee would bee in his countrey to destroy him; and if hee would withstand his entrance, hee should stay for him. That night he lodged there; and the next day hee came to the habitation of <HI>Naguatex,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naguatex.</NOTE> which was very scattering: he inquired where the Ca∣ciques chiefe towne was? They told him that it was on the other side of a Riuer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Riuer.</NOTE> that passed thereby: hee trauelled thitherward, and came vnto it: and on the other side hee saw many Indians, that taried for him, making shew as though they would defend the pas∣sage. And because hee knew not whether it could bee waded, nor where the passage was; and that some Christians and horses were hurt; that they might haue time to recouer, he determined to rest certaine daies in the towne where he was. So hee pitched his campe a quarter of a league from the Riuer, because the wea∣ther was very hot, neere vnto the towne, in a thinne groue of very faire and hie trees neere a brookes side: and in that place were certaine Indians taken; whom hee examined, whether the Riuer were wadeable or no?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> They said, yea, at some times, and in some places.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Gouernour departed from <HI>Non∣dacao</HI> toward <HI>Soacatino,</HI> and in fiue daies iournie came to a Prouince called <HI>Aays.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aays.</NOTE> The Indians which inhabited it, had no notice of the Christians: but assoone as they saw that they entred into their country, they assembled themselues: and as they came toge∣ther 50. or 100. they came foorth to fight: while some fought, others came and charged our men another way, and while they followed some, others followed them. The fight lasted the greatest part of the day, till they came to their towne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A towne.</NOTE> Some horses and men were wounded, but not to any hurt of their trauelling: for there was no wound that was dangerous. There was a great spoile made of the Indians. That day that the Gouernour departed from thence, the Indian that guided him said, that in <HI>Nondacao</HI> he had heard say, that the Indians of <HI>Soacatino</HI> had seene other Christians, whereof they all were very glad: thinking it might be true, and that they might haue entred into those parts by <HI>Nueua Espanna;</HI> and that if it were so, it was in their owne hand to goe out of <HI>Florida,</HI> if they found no∣thing

For that little Maiz which the Indians had, they had hidden and buried in the woods, where the Chri∣stians, after they were well wearied with their trauell, at the end of their iournie went to seeke by digging what they should eat. At last, comming to a Prouince that was called <HI>Guasco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Guasco: here they found some Turkie stones, and mantles of cotton wooll.

<P> How they returned to <HI>Nilco,</HI> and came to <HI>Minoya,</HI> where they agreed to make ships to depart out of the land of <HI>Florida.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen that which was determined was published in the Campe, there were many that were greatly grieued at it: for they held the Sea voyage as doubtfull, for the euill meanes they had, and of as great danger, as the trauelling by land: and they hoped to finde some rich countrie before they came to the land of the Chri∣stians, by that which <HI>Cabeça de Vaca</HI> had told the Em∣perour: and that was this; That after hee had found clothes made of cotton wooll,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold, siluer and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> hee saw gold and siluer, and stones of great value. And they had not yet come wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re hee had been. For vntill that place hee alwaies trauelled by the Sea coast: and they trauelled farre within the land; and that going toward the West, of necessitie they should come where hee had been. For he said, That in a certain place he trauelled many daies, and entred into the land toward the North. And in <HI>Guasco</HI> they had alreadie found some Turkie stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kie stone and man les <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> and mantles of cotton wooll: which the Indians signi∣fied by signes that they had from the West: and that holding that course they should draw neere to the land of the Christians. But though they were much discontented with it, and it grieued many to goe back∣ward, which would rather haue aduentured their liues and haue died in the land of <HI>Florida,</HI> then to haue gone
<PB N="147" REF="78"/> poore out of it: yet were they not a sufficient part to hinder that which was determined, because the princi∣pall men agreed with the Gouernour. And afterward there was one that said, hee would put out one of his owne eyes, to put out another of <HI>Luis de Moscoso;</HI> be∣cause it would grieue him much to see him prosper: because aswell himself as others of his friends had cros∣sed that which hee durst not haue done, seeing that within two daies hee should leaue the gouernment. From <HI>Daycao,</HI> where now they were, to <HI>Rio grande,</HI> or the Great Riuer, was 150 leagues:<NOTE PLACE="marg">150 leagues betweene the Riuer of Day∣cao, and Rio grande.</NOTE> which vnto that place they had gone Westward. And by the way as they returned backe they had much adoe to find Maiz to eate: for where they had passed, the countrey was destroyed: and some little Maiz that was left the In∣dians had hidden. The townes which in <HI>Naguatex</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naguatex.</NOTE> they had burned (whereof it repented them) were re∣paired againe, and the houses full of Maiz.

The Gouernour wrote vnto him, and sent him inke and paper that he might answere. The substance of the words of the letter was to declare vnto him his determination, which was, to goe out of the land of <HI>Florida,</HI> and to put him in remembrance that he was a Christian, that hee would not remaine in the subiection of Infidels, that hee pardoned him the fault which he had done in going away to the Indians, that hee should come vnto him: and if they did stay him, that hee would aduertise him thereof by writing.
<PB N="148" REF="79"/> The Indian went with the letter, and came again with∣out any more answere, then, on the back side, his name and his seale, that they might know he was aliue. The Gouernour sent twelue horsemen to seeke him: but he, which had his spies, so hid himselfe, that they could not find him. For want of Maiz the Gouernour could not stay any longer to seeke him.

Euery one was confounded, and the most part thought it bad c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uns<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll to come backe from the Riuer of <HI>Daycao,</HI> and not to haue followed their fortune, going that way that went ouer land. For by Sea it seemed impossible to saue themselues, vnlesse God would worke a mi∣racle for them: for there was neither Pilot, nor Sea-chart, neither did they know where the Riuer entred into the Sea, neither had they notice of it, neither had they any thing wherewith to make sailes, nor any store of Enequem, which is a grasse whereof they make Okam, which grew there: and that which they found they saued to calke the Pinaces withall, neither had they any thing to pitch them withall: neither could they m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke ships of such substance, but that any storme would put thē in great danger: and they feared much it would fall out with them, as it did with <HI>Pamphilo de
<PB N="149" REF="79"/> Naruaez,</HI> which was cast away vpon that coast: And aboue all other it troubled them most, that they could finde no Maiz: for without it they could not bee su∣stained, nor could doe any thing that they had neede of. All of them were put to great confusion. Their chiefe remedy was to commit themselues to God, and to beseeeh him that he would direct them the way that they might saue their liues. And it pleased him of his goodnesse, that the Indians of <HI>Nilco</HI> came peaceablie, and told them, that two daies iourney from thence, neere vnto the Great Riuer, were two townes, where∣of the Christians had no notice, and that the prouince was called <HI>Minoya,</HI> and was a fruitfull soile: that, whe∣ther at this present there was any Maiz or no, they knew not, because they had warre with them: but that they would be very glad with the fauour of the Chri∣stians to goe and spoyle them. The Gouernour sent a Captaine thither with horsemen and footmen, and the Indians of <HI>Nilco</HI> with him. Hee came to <HI>Minoya,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Minoya.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Ssoone as they came to <HI>Minoya,</HI> the Gouernor commanded them to ga∣ther all the chaines together, which euerie one had to lead Indians in; and to gather al the yron which they had for their prouision, and al the rest that was in the Camp: and to set vp a forge to make nailes, and commanded them to cut downe timber for the brigandines. And a Portugall of <HI>Ceuta,</HI> who hauing bin a prisoner in <HI>Fez,</HI> had learned to saw timber with a
<PB N="151" REF="80"/> long saw, which for such purposes they had carried with them, did teach others, which helped him to saw timber. And a <HI>Genowis,</HI> whom it pleased God to pre∣serue (for without him they had neuer come out of the countrie: for there was neuer another that could make ships but hee) with foure or fiue other <HI>Biscaine</HI> carpenters, which hewed his plancks and other tim∣bers, made the brigandines: And two calkers, the one of <HI>Genua,</HI> the other of <HI>Sardinia</HI> did calke them with the tow of an hearb like hempe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enequen is an herbe like Hempe.</NOTE> whereof before I haue made mention, which there is named Enequen.

And for certaine it seemed that God was willing to fauour them in so great necessitie, moouing the minds of the Indians to bring them: for to goe to take them, they were neuer able. For in the towne
<PB N="152" REF="81"/> where they were, assoone as winter came in, they were so inclosed and compassed with water, y<SUP>t</SUP> they could go no farther by land, then a league, &amp; a league &amp; an half.

They made certaine rafts of timber, and laid manie boughes vpon them, wheron they set their hor∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and in the houses they did the like. But seeing that n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thing preuailed, they went vp to the lofts: and if they went out of the houses, it was in canoes, or on horsebac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in those places where the ground was hiest. So they were two moneths, and could doe nothing, during which time the Riuer decreased not. The In∣dians ceased not to come vnto the brigantines as they were wont, and came in canoes.

<PB N="155" REF="82"/> that of the Maiz which they had taken from them, they would bestow some crummes vpon them. And because the Countrie was fertill, and the people vsed to feed of Maiz, and the Christians had gotten all from them that they had, and the people were many, they were not able to sustaine themselues. Those which came to the towne were so weake and feeble, that they had no flesh left on their bones: and many came and died neere the towne for pure hunger and weakenesse. The Gouernour commanded vpon grieuous punish∣ments to giue them no Maiz. Yet, when they saw that the hogges wanted it not, and that they had yeelded themselues to serue them, &amp; considering their miserie and wretchednes, hauing pity of thē, they gaue them part of the Maiz which they had. And when the time of their embarkment came, there was not sufficient to serue their owne turnes. That which there was, they put into the brigandines, and into great canoes tied two and two together. They shipped 22. of the best horses, that were in the Camp, the rest they made dried flesh of; and dressed the hogges which they had in like manner.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe day before they departed from <HI>Minoya,</HI> they determined to dismisse al the men &amp; wo∣men of the Countrie, which they had detai∣ned as slaues to serue them, saue some hundred, little
<PB N="156" REF="83"/> more or lesse, which the Gouernour embarked, and o∣thers whom it pleased him to permit. And because there were many men of qualitie, whom he could not deny that which he granted to others, he vsed a policy, saying, that they might serue them as long as they were in the Riuer, but when they came to the sea, they must send them away for want of water, because they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but few vessels.

The most of them did nothing but weepe: which mooued great compassion; seeing that all of them with good will would haue become Christians, and were left in state of perdition. There went from <HI>Mi∣noya</HI> 322 Spaniards in seuen brigandines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They saile downe Rio Grande from Minoya 17. daies before they came to the mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h thereof.</NOTE> well made, saue that the plankes were thin, because the nailes were short, and were not pitched, nor had any decks to keep the water from comming in. In stead of decks they laid planks, whereon the mariners might runne to trim their sailes, and the people might refresh themselues aboue and below. The Gouernour made his Cap∣taines, and gaue to euery one his brigandine, and took their oth and their word, that they would obey him, vntill they came to the land of the Christians. The Gouernour tooke one of the brigandines for himself,
<PB N="157" REF="83"/> which he best liked. The same day that they departed from <HI>Minoya,</HI> they passed by <HI>Guachoya,</HI> where the In∣dians tarried for them in canoes by the Riuer. And on the shore, they had made a great arbour with boughes: They desired him to come on shore; but he excused himselfe, and so went along: The Indians in their ca∣noes accompanied him; and comming where an arme of the Riuer declined on the right hand, they said, that the Prouince of <HI>Quigalta</HI> was neere vnto that place, and importuned the Gouernour to set vpon him, and that they would aide him. And because they had said, that he dwelt three daies iournie downe the Riuer, the Gouernour supposed that they had plotted some trea∣son against him, and there left them; and went downe with the greatest force of the water. The current was very strong, and with the helpe of ores, they went very swiftly. The first day they landed in a wood on the left hand of the Riuer, and at night they withdrew themselues to the brigandines.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second day.</NOTE> The next day they came to a towne, where they went on shore, and the people that was in it durst not tarrie. A woman that they tooke there being examined, said, that that towne belonged to a Cacique named <HI>Huasene,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Huasene.</NOTE> subiect to <HI>Qui∣galta,</HI> and that <HI>Quigalta</HI> tarried for them below in the Riuer with many men. Certaine horsemen went thi∣ther, and found some houses, wherein was much Maiz. Immediately more of them went thither and tarried there one day, in which they did beate out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another day.</NOTE> and tooke as much Maiz as they needed. While they were there, many Indians came from the nether part of the Riuer, and on the other side right against them some∣what carelessely set themselues in order to fight. The Gouernour sent in two canoes the crossebowmen
<PB N="158" REF="84"/> that he had, and as many more as could goe in them. They ran away, and seeing the Spaniards could not o∣uertake them, they returned backe, and tooke courage; and comming neerer, making an outcrie, they threat∣ned them: and assoone as they departed thence, they went after them, some in canoes, and some by land a∣long the Riuer; and getting before, comming to a towne that stood by the Riuers side, they ioyned alto∣gether, making a shew that they would tarrie there.

<P>The Gouernour answered him, that he beleeued all that he said was true, and willed him to tell him, that he esteemed his friendship very much. With this answer
<PB N="159" REF="84"/> they returned to the place where the rest in their ca∣noes were waiting for them, and from thence all of them fell downe, and came neere the Spaniards, shou∣ting aloud, and threatning of them. The Gouernour sent <HI>Iohn de Guzman,</HI> which had been a Captaine of footemen in <HI>Florida,</HI> with 15. armed men in canoes to make them giue way. Assoone as the Indians saw them come towards them, they diuided themselues into two parts, and stood still till the Spaniards came nie them, and when they were come neere them, they ioy∣ned together on both sides, taking <HI>Iohn de Guzman</HI> in the middest, and them that came first with him, and with great furie borded them: And as their canoes were bigger, and many of them leaped into the water to stay them, and to lay hold on the canoes of the Spa∣niards, and ouerwhelme them; so presently they ouer∣whelmed them. The Christians fell into the water, and with the weight of their armour sunke downe to the bottome: and some few, that by swimming or hol∣ding by the canoe could haue saued themselues, with oares and staues, which they had, they strooke them on the head and made them sinke. When they of the bri∣gandines saw the ouerthrow, though they went about to succour them, yet through the current of the Ri∣uer they could not goe backe.

And the Indians seeing that they could not shoote leuell, shot their arrowes at randon vp into the aire, which fell into the brigandines, and hurt some of the men: and not therewith contented, they sought to get to them which were in the canoes with the horses. Those of the brigandines enuironed them to defend them, and tooke them among them.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Alfe a league before they came to the sea, they came to anker to rest themselues thereabout a day: for they were very weary with rowing
<PB N="163" REF="86"/> and out of heart. For by the space of many daies they had eaten nothing but parched and sodden Maiz; which they had by allowance euery day an headpeece ful by strike for euery three mē. While they rode there at anker seuen canoes of Indians came to set vpō those, which they brought with them. The Gouernour com∣manded armed men to go aboord them, and to driue them farther off. They came also against them by land through a thick wood, and a moorish ground, and had staues with very sharp forked heads made of the bones of fishes, and fought verie valiantly with vs, which went out to encounter them. And the other that came in canoes with their arrowes staied for them that came against them, and at their comming both those that were on land, and those in the canoes wounded some of vs: And seeing vs come neere them, they turned their backs, and like swift horses among footemen gat away from vs; making some returnes, and reuniting themselues together, going not past a bow shot off: for in so retiring they shot, without receiuing any hurt of the Christians. For though they had some bowes, yet they could not vse them; and brake their armes with rowing to ouertake them. And the Indians easily in their compasse went with their canoes, staying and wheeling about as it had been in a skirmish, perceiuing that those that came against them could not offend them. And the more they stroue to come neere them, the more hurt they receiued. Assoone as they had dri∣uen them farther off, they returned to the brigandines. They staied two daies there: And departed from thence vnto the place, where the arme of the Riuer en∣treth into the sea. They sounded in the Riuer neere vnto the Sea, and found 40. fathoms water. They
<PB N="164" REF="87"/> staied there. And the Gouernour commanded al and singular persons to speake their minds touching their voiage, whether it were best to crosse ouer to <HI>Nueua Es∣panna,</HI> committing thēselues to the hie sea, or whether they should keepe along the coast. There were sundry opinions touching this matter: wherein <HI>Iohn Danusco,</HI> which presumed much, and tooke much vpon him in the knowledge of nauigation, and matters of the sea, although hee had but little experience, mooued the Gouernour with his talke: and his opinion was se∣conded by some others. And they affirmed, that it was much better to passe by the hie sea, and crosse the gulfe, which was three of foure parts the lesser trauell, because in going along y<SUP>e</SUP> coast, they went a great way about, by reason of the compasse, which the land did make. <HI>Iohn Danusco</HI> said, that he had seene the seacard, and that from the place where they were, the coast ran East and West vnto <HI>Rio de las Palmas;</HI> and from <HI>Rio de las Palmas</HI> to <HI>Nueua Espanna</HI> from North to South: and therefore in sailing alwaies in sight of land would bee a great compassing about and spending of much time; &amp; that they would be in great danger to be ouertaken with winter before they should get to the land of the Christians: and that in 10. or 12. daies space, hauing good weather, they might bee there in crossing ouer. The most part were against this opinion, and said, that it was more safe to go along the coast, though they stai∣ed the longer: because their ships were very weake and without decks, so that a very little storme was e∣nough to cast them away: and if they should be hin∣dred with calmes, or contrarie weather, through the small store of vessels which they had to carrie water in, they should likewise fall into great danger: and that
<PB N="165" REF="87"/> although the ships were such as they might venture in them, yet hauing neither Pilot nor Seacard to guide themselues, it was no good counsell to crosse the gulfe. This opinion was confirmed by the greatest part: and they agreed to go along the coast. At the time where∣in they sought to depart from thence, the cable of the anker of the Gouernours brigandine brake, and the an∣ker remained in the Riuer. And albeit, they were neere the shore, yet it was so deepe, that the Diuers di∣uing many times could neuer find it: which caused great sadnes in the Gouernour, and in all those that went with him in his brigandine: But with a grind∣stone which they had, and certaine bridles which re∣mained to some of the Gentlemen, and men of wor∣ship which had horses, they made a weight which ser∣ued in stead of an anker. The 18. of Iuly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They landed the 30. of May, 1539. Chap. 7. they went foorth to sea Iuly 18. 1543.</NOTE> they went foorth to sea with faire and prosperous weather for their voiage. And seeing that they were gone two or three leagues from the shore, the Captaines of the o∣ther brigandines ouertooke them, and asked the Go∣uernour, wherefore he did put off from the shore? and that if he would leaue the coast, he should say so; and he should not do it without the consent of all: and that if hee did otherwise, they would not follow him, but that euery one would doe what seemed best vnto him∣selfe. The Gouernour answered, that hee would doe nothing without their counsell, but that hee did beare off from the land to saile the better and safer by night; and that the next day when time serued, he would re∣turne to the sight of land againe. They sailed with a reasonable good wind that day and the night follow∣ing, and the next day till euening song,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fresh water al∣most two daies sailing in the Sea.</NOTE> alwaies in fresh water: whereat they wondred much: for they were

They sailed two daies, and when they would haue come to sight of land they could not, for the winde blew from the shore. On the fourth day, seeing their fresh water began to faile, fea∣ring necessitie and danger, they all complained of <HI>Iohn Danusco,</HI> and of the Gouernour that followed his coun∣sell: and euery one of the Captaines said, that they would no more goe from the shore, though the Go∣uernour went whither he would. It pleased God that the winde changed though but a little: and at the end of foure daies after they had put to sea, being alreadie destitute of water, by force of rowing they got within sight of land, and with great trouble recouered it, in an open roade.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An open Roade.</NOTE> That euening the winde came to the South, which on that coast is a crosse winde, and draue the brigandines against the shore, because it blew very hard, and the anchors were so weake, that they yeelded and began to bend.

Two of the brigandines, which sailed that night with all their sailes, by breake of day had ouershot the Riuer of <HI>Panuco</HI> without see∣ing it. Of the fiue that came behind, the first that came vnto it was that wherein <HI>Calderan</HI> was Captaine. A quarter of a league before they came at it, and before they did see it, they saw the water muddie, and knew it to be fresh water: and comming right against the Ri∣uer, they saw, where it entred into the Sea, that the wa∣ter brake vpon a shold. And because there was no man there that knew it, they were in doubt whether they should goe in, or goe along, and they resolued to goe in: and before they came vnto the current, they went close to the shore, and entred into the port: and assoone as they were come in, they saw Indian men and wo∣men apparelled like Spaniards: whom they asked in

They answered in Spanish, that it was the Riuer of <HI>Panuco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riuer of Panuco: the towne 15. leagues from the mouth of the Riuer.</NOTE> and that the towne of the Christians was 15 leagues vp within the land. The ioy that all of them receiued vpon these newes cannot sufficiently be expressed: for it seemed vnto them, that at that instant they were borne again. And many went on shore and kissed the ground, and kneeling on their knees, with lifting vp their hands and eyes to heauen, they all ceased not to giue God thankes. Those which came after, assoone as they saw <HI>Calderan</HI> come to an anchor with his brigandine in the Riuer, presently went thither, and came into the hauen. The other two brigandines which had ouershot the place, put to sea to returne backe to seeke the rest, and could not doe it, because the winde was contrarie and the Sea growne: they were afraid of being cast away, and recouering the shore they cast anchor. While they rode there a storme arose: and seeing that they could not abide there, much lesse endure at Sea, they resolued to runne on shore; and as the brigandines were but small, so did they draw but little water; and where they were it was a sandie coast. By which occasion the force of their sailes draue them on shore, without any hurt of them that were in them.

<HEAD>Of the fauour which they found at the hands of the Vice∣roy, and of the inhabitants of the Citie of <HI>Mexico.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Rom <HI>Panuco</HI> to the great Citie <HI>Temisti∣tan Mexico</HI> is 60. leagues; and other 60. from <HI>Panuco</HI> to the Port <HI>de Vera Cruz,</HI> where they take shipping for <HI>Spaine,</HI> and those that come from <HI>Spaine</HI> do land to go for <HI>Nueua Espanna.</HI> These three townes stand in a triangle: to wit, <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> to the South, <HI>Panuco</HI> to the North, and <HI>Mexico</HI> to the West, 60. leagues asunder. The Countrie is so inha∣bited with Indians, that from towne to towne, those which are farthest, are but a league, and halfe a league asunder. Some of them that came from <HI>Florida</HI> staied a moneth in <HI>Panuco</HI> to rest themselues, others fifteene daies, and euery one as long as he listed: for there was none that shewed a sower countenance to his guests, but rather gaue them any thing that they had, and see∣med to be grieued when they took their leaue. Which was to be beleeued. For the victuals, which the Indi∣ans doe pay them for tribute, are more then they can spend: and in that towne is no commerce; and there
<PB N="175" REF="92"/> dwelt but few Spaniards there, and they were glad of their companie. The Alcalde Mayor diuided all the Emperours clothes which he had (which there they pay him for his tribute) among those that would come to receiue them. Those which had shirts of maile lest, were glad men: for they had a horse for one shirt of maile: Some horsed themselues: and such as could not (which were the greatest part) tooke their iournie on foote: in which they were well receiued of the In∣dians that were in the townes, and better serued, then they could haue been in their owne houses, though they had been well to liue. For if they asked one hen of an Indian, they brought them foure: and if they as∣ked any of the Countrie fruit, though it were a league off, they ran presently for it. And if any Christian found himself euill at ease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is the manner of China, to car∣rie men in chaires.</NOTE> they carried him in a chaire from one towne to another. In whatsoeuer towne they came, the Cacique, by an Indian which carri∣ed a rod of Iustice in his hand, whom they call Ta∣pile, that is to say, a sergeant, commanded them to prouide victuals for them, and Indians to beare bur∣dens of such things as they had, and such as were needfull to carrie them that were sicke. The Vice∣roy sent a Portugall 20. leagues from <HI>Mexico,</HI> with great store of sugar, raisons of the Sunne, and con∣serues, and other things fit for sicke folkes, for such as had neede of them: and had giuen order to cloth them all at the Emperours charges. And their approch being knowne by the citizens of <HI>Mexico,</HI> they went out of the towne to receiue them: and with great courtesie, requesting them in fauour to come to their houses, e∣uery one carried such as hee met home with him, and
<PB N="176" REF="93"/> clothed them euery one the best they could: so that he which had the meanest apparrell, it cost aboue 30. ducats. As many as were willing to come to the Vice∣royes house he commanded to be apparelled, and such as were persons of qualitie sate at his table: and there was a table in his house for as many of the meaner sort as would come to it: and he was presently informed, who euery one was, to shew him the courtesie that he deserued. Some of the Cōquerors did set both gentle∣men and clownes at their owne table, and many times made the seruant sit cheeke by cheeke by his master: and chiefly the officers and men of base condition did so: for those which had better education did enquire who euery one was, and made difference of persons: but all did what they could with a good will: and eue∣ry one told them whom they had in their houses, that they should not trouble themselues, nor thinke them∣selues the worse, to take that which they gaue them: for they had bin in the like case, and had bin relieued of others, and that this was the custome of that coun∣trey. God reward them all: and God grant, that those which it pleased him to deliuer out of <HI>Florida,</HI> and to bring againe into Christendome, may serue him: and vnto those that died in that countrey, and vnto all that beleeue in him and confesse his holy faith, God for his mercie sake grant the kingdome of heauen.
