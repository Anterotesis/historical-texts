<HEAD>THE <HI>Introduction.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SEeing divers have undertaken to treat about Horses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> those most excellent of Ani∣mal Creatures, I have not thought it a∣miss from long experience, to lay down (as I well hope to the satisfaction of the skilful reader) such perfect Rules and Methods, to or∣der and mannage Horses in all their useful capa∣cities, as have been hitherto but lightly touched by such as have made essays in the like nature; for as the Horse may worthiliest challenge place, as the noblest and goodliest, the necessariest and trusti∣est Beast that we use in our service: and since he serveth to so many ends, notwithstanding much may have been spoken on that Subject, yet it is not doubted, but in that, as on all other Subjects, where so large a Field is given to treat, something material may be omitted by those who have tra∣vailed therein, that may occur to the memory and deliberate judgment of those that come after them.
<PB N="2" REF="15"/> For as all Arts are bettered by long Experience, and improved by time and industry, this amongst the rest, worthy the Studies and Labour of the most industrious, must needs admit of variety, and afford new matter of discovery: Therefore, Reader, I shall no longer trespass upon your Patience, but to sa∣tisfie your expectation, open the Cabinet, wherein are contained such rarities, as are worthy the notice of the most Experienced and Learned upon Earth: and since Horses serve for sundry purposes, as Pleasure, Profit, and War, in Racing, Travel∣ing, Hunting, servile labour, Charging in the Field and the like; I shall first declare how they ought to be bred, and at first chose, as most fit and pro∣mising, to the uses they are designed for, and so pro∣ceed to each particular, relating to mannagement, Ordering, Cure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Compleat Horseman,</HI> OR, Gentlemans Delight.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first consideration in relation to Pa∣sture for Horses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe first thing to be considered in Breeding is the commodi∣ousness of the Ground, wherein the Horses, Mares and Colts are to run, which must in no wise be too rank of Grass, nor over sparing, but a firm, sweet Soil, situate in a wholsome Air, somewhat ascending; inclosed with Quicksets and spreading Trees, the better to shelter your Beasts from the wind or heat of the Sun: Nor let your Mares, Colts or Horses continue long in one Pasture, but put them into fresh Pasture, and let the vicis∣situde be so often as occasion requires, or as you find them uneasie, which will ap∣pear ether by their carelesness in feeding, attempting to leap the Hedges, Ditches, or making continually towards the Gate,
<PB N="4" REF="16"/> and looking through it or over it: The Summer Pastures must be shady as afore∣said, and those you intend to winter them in, accommodated with a Hovel, Hay-rick, Barn, Stable, or some convenient house to shelter them from the stormy blasts, es∣pecially the Colts, who are by nature tender the first year.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Directions and Rules about the choice of Horses.</HEAD>
<P>THe next thing to be considered, is the choice of Stallions and Mares; First, let your Stallion have hoofs hard and sound, round and hollow, to keep the feet from the Ground, his Legs even and straight, his knees round, flexible and small, his Thighs large and well brawned, his Breast great and broad, his neck soft and broad bending Arch-wise, his Main thick, and for the most part falling on the right side, his Head small and lean, for a great head betokens a dull and heavy Jade, his Mouth ever moist, his Eyes great and bloody, or rather fiery, standing as it were, out of his head, which is a sign of quickness and liveliness, his Ears short
<PB REF="16"/> and standing upright, his Nostrils wide, his Shoulders large and straight, the sides turn∣ing inwards, the ridge bone over the shoul∣ders being somewhat high, his Sides deep and well knit behind, his Loyns broad, his Belly gaunt, his Buttocks full of flesh, his Tail long, brisly and curled: these be∣ing the tokens of a good Stallion, and in∣deed of a good Horse for all services; the con∣trary properties denoting badness: And now I shall proceed to the description of a good Mare for breeding; first, observe she be not subject to diseases, nor above three or four years old, let her have a fair forehead, lively eyes, standing ears, a large womb, a bright colour, and well metled, gentle and easie to be handled, for wild Mares are too apt to destroy their Colts in their bellies, and when foaled will not easily brook the weaning of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>How to oblige a Mare that is unwilling to take the Horse, to be covered, when; and in what manner she ought to be covered, and how afterwards to be used.</HEAD>
<P>IF your Mare be backward to take the Horse, which will appear by her bi∣ting and kicking at him, then turn to her a stone Horse of small stature, who by his nimble running about her and playing with her, will soon wooe, or oblige her to gentleness, so that she will suffer her self to be covered, which willingness perceived, take away the said Horse, and the next mor∣ning about Sunrising, put to her your Stalli∣on having been well provendered, but suf∣fered to drink little, put him to her in a close fenced ground, where she will in a short time permit him to cover her, the which when he has twice or thrice done, let her graze, but keep her from water; taking the Horse from her, whom you must rub down and well provender till E∣vening, at what time turn him loose to your Mare again, and let him cover her as often
<PB N="7" REF="17"/> as he pleaseth, unless you perceive him too robust or furious, that thereby he may su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tain injury.</P>
<P>The Mare thus covered, unless she be greatly desirous of his company a third time, you need not put him to her again, but lead the Mare into the water above the belly, and there let her drink, though no great quan∣tity, after which turn her to the Stud of Mares, not permitting any Horse to come at her for the space of one month.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To make a Mare be Covered, when you per∣ceive she has not Conceived of the former. The time best for Covering; what diet is best for the Stallion, to prepare him for Covering; how to use your Mare when she is with Foal.</HEAD>
<P>IF you conceit your Mare or Mares have not conceived by their being co∣vered, and yet decline taking Horse, put among them a Mare that is desirous to be covered, and then turn in your Stallion, who by covering the Mare last put in, will provoke the others to suffer themselves to be covered. The most convenient time to suffer your Mares to be covered, is in <HI>May,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> for then
<PB N="8" REF="18"/> the Colts by not coming too early in the Spring, will find warm weather, and green Pasture to nourish and preserve them. When you intend your Stallion shall cover your Mare; the best way is to let him feed on Grass, for by that means his Limbs will be more pliable, and his Wind the longer; when as hard meat will not only make him somewhat Restif, but sub∣ject him if he much over-strain himself, to break his wind When your Mare is fourteen or fifteen days gone with Foal, take her up from the other Mares; and with one gentle Mare or Gelding put her into rank and well inclosed Pasture, which will render her lusty, desirous again to be covered, the more easily to bring forth her Colt, and store her with milk for its nou∣rishment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What time your Stallion will conveniently serve for Covering. What years in the Horse and Mare produce the best Colts, and when it is most con∣venient to wean Colts.</HEAD>
<P>A Good Stallion proportioned according to the aforesaid description, if mo∣derately used, will serve well six or seven years, to cover yearly six or seven Mares; and may in the intervall be put to such la∣bour
<PB N="9" REF="18"/> as you think necessary, unless extra∣ordinary travel in a long journey, where∣by he may be greatly wasted and impair∣ed. From three years old till ten, good Mares will conceive Colts; and a good Stal∣lion, from four or five, till ten or twelve, get them. The best time to wean Colts is <HI>Shrovetide,</HI> or <HI>Candlemass;</HI> and for the three first years, have great care of them, but especially the first year, when they take no great delight in themselves, for moaning after their Dams; and if you neglect the years aforesaid, to well Winter or Summer them, they will scarcely prove good Horses: the best way to order them, is to keep them out of the Neighing of their Dams, pinned up fourteen days after their weaning: after which days let them out on Sunshiny days to play in little Pingles, or warm inclosed Pa∣stures, putting them up again so soon as you perceive them dull and heavy; and so con∣tinue them with good feeding till <HI>May;</HI> then the weather being warm, let them run in good Pasture, neither too rank nor too low; but such as Milch Kine are usually Pastured in, but be sure it be into soil that produceth sweet Grass, and in this manner continue them, till they have forgotten their Dams.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>Provender most convenient for Colts after two years old, till they become fit for service. The reasons why English breed ought not to be taken up so young, though more convenient for their Masters. How to handle and break wild and headstrong Horses, and to use them after they are made Gentle. The best feed∣ing in the winter for Mares and Colts of two years old, and what age is best to handle them.</HEAD>
<P>BE sure to observe that your weanlings of the age aforesaid be not put to winter in cold wet Moorish ground, nor in Summer to feed in over rank Pasture; for the one subjects them to all watery diseases, and the other to the Glanders, Colds, and the like. Therefore let your Colts range in dry, short and warm pastures, that they may find enough to suffice them, and too much. And lest their growth be obstru∣cted by covering any Mare, keep them from so doing, till they are five years old at least.</P>
<P>Many are of opinion that English Horses are taken up so young, because, that if they should come to their full strength ere they are broken, they would hardly be tamed,
<PB N="11" REF="19"/> though this does altogether prove a vul∣gar error: for by often using young Horses to seed them by hand, will make them tame, at any year, and to lay light weights upon them, which will in no wise hinder their growth, will prepare them to indure backing: Therefore it is my opinion that English Horses may be broken and brought to hand, at any time, as well as those of other Nations: And that the taking them up before they come to their strength and growth, is for that their Masters are covetous of their service, and will not permit them to be idle and chargeable any longer than needs must; and this is the reason why English Hor∣ses fall short many times in goodness, or at least in esteem, to those of other Nations. For certain it is, that <HI>England</HI> is as capable of as good a breed as any Nation whatsoever; and that by watching and keeping a Horse hungry, he at any age may be made tame or broken in a months time.</P>
<P>If a Horse be headstrong, suffer him to have no provender, but what he takes out of your hands, in a stable or close yard, and so within a while he will come acquainted with you, and suffer you to take up his feet, and by degrees to back and handle him at pleasure.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
<P>Observe that when you have rid your Horse, keep him upon his Bridle, or gently moving till he be cold, and in no wise ride him hard upon a full stomach, and it will preserve him from Sickness, Lameness and the like, unless some extraordinary thing befall him.</P>
<P>In winter time keep your Mares and weanling in a warm pasture, where a Rack being placed, you must put thereinto, at di∣vers times, sweet Provender; and if it prove wet, misty, raw weather, they must be sheltred in a Stable, Barn or Hovel, but if clear Frosty weather, not too extream, they may be left abroad. Let your pasture be near your house, and about <HI>Shrovetide</HI> shift it, and let them continue in fresh pa∣sture till <HI>May,</HI> at which time the Grass will be sufficiently sprung in most places, and that time is the only time in all the year to produce hunger bane, and render the young Mares so lean that they will not be capa∣ble of bringing forth their Colts.</P>
<P>Take not up your Colts till they be four or five years old; for if sooner, they will greatly suffer, by untimely riding, and be∣come stiff, diseased, and unserviceable be∣fore they be twelve years old, when other∣wise they will continue serviceable twen∣ty four or twenty five years: and the rea∣son
<PB N="13" REF="20"/> why the Spanish Horses are so soon past their best, is for that they at two or three years old at the most, take them up for want of ground to feed them in.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to know what Colt will make a true shaped Horse. To help Mares that are diffi∣cult in foaling. To order Colts upon wean∣ing. Separating and gelding of Colts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT six months old the shape may be discerned that he will be of at six years old, if he be not wronged or spoiled in keeping and bringing up; the defects are also to be seen at the same time.</P>
<P>The shin-bone being long and large from the Pastern to the knee, denotes the Colt to prove a tall Horse. And what space is found in a Colt new foaled, be∣tween the Withers and knee, double that space will appear when he is full grown. Ob∣serve the activeness, lively spirits, and stri∣ving for mastery over their fellows amongst Colts, for such denote they will prove well mettalled, and serviceable Horses; when dulness foreshews the contrary.</P>
<P>If a Mare be distressed in her foaling, the ready way to make her bring forth, is to stop both her Nostrils with your hand,
<PB N="14" REF="21"/> that so she may be the better obliged to strain her self, or if that fail, take Madder to the quantity of a Pigeons Egg, boil it in a pint of ALE, and give it her warm.</P>
<P>If her Secundine, after foaling, come not away, take a handfull or two of young fennel, boil it in running-water, or spring-water if you can get it, half a pint of which mix with as much Malmsie, and a fourth quantity of Olive Oyle, and put it blood warm into the Nostrils of your Mare, and hold them close, or in defect of this, give her green Wheat or Rye to eat, but the former medicine is best, and will answer the end for which it was given. Observe that your Mare in no wise eat her Clean∣sing, for it is not only unwholsome, but a great obstructer of her producing milk.</P>
<P>When a Colt is weaned, put him out of the hearing of his Dam as aforesaid, and the sooner to make him forget her, give him Savin and Butter, which will effect it. Put him not to hard pasture, till the second or third year after his weaning.</P>
<P>Separate your Mare and Stone Colts at a year at furthest, for the Stone Colts being high fed and of much mettal, will attempt to cover the Mare Colts at the end of a year, which if permitted, proves the spoiling of them both. Nor is it a∣miss
<PB N="15" REF="21"/> but altogether convenient, to separate each years breed by putting them into di∣vers pastures.</P>
<P>To geld Stone-Colts, the convenientest time is (and with the least danger) at nine days old, if the Stones come down; if not let some days more pass ere you attempt it: In this case, the time of the Moon and the signs are to be observed: The best time is when the Moon is in the Wain, and the sign in <HI>Virgo,</HI> or <HI>Aries.</HI> And the best time in the year is the Spring and Fall: but al∣though these are the safest and convenientest times, yet this work may be done by a skillful hand at any time, as well on full grown Horses as young Colts. And thus much I have thought fit to lay down for the instruction of the Breeder, which is the chiefest Office relating to a Horse; for if he be spoiled in the breeding, all la∣bour, cost and care bestowed upon him will prove fruitless, for he will never be a com∣pleat Horse.</P>

<P>A Horse of never so good a breed, and carefully brought up to the Saddle, falling into the hands of an unskillful man∣nager, is like an unstrung instrument, or a Ship without a Rudder. Therefore I have not thought it at all unnecessary, but altoge∣ther convenient to reveal this part or myste∣ry of Horsemanship, that every man, with∣out being beholding to others for advice,
<PB N="17" REF="22"/> or putting himself to the charge of a Horse∣breaker, may mannage his own Beast to such advantages as he sees fit, or best ap∣proves of, which I shall lay down in these following Rules.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Experienced Rules for Saddling and Mouthing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOur Horse taken up, and with feeding by hand and handling made somewhat familiar, hang the Saddle and Bridle al∣ways near him, and often offer to put them on, till at last he will suffer you to do it; then girt him about, though not too hard, but rather put small wisps of Hay between his body and the girths for his ease, and let your Bridle be as easie as may be, though strong and well put on to pre∣vent his headstrongness if he attempt it. Then in a fair day carry him abroad into a plain field or other convenient place, and make him trot round you, sometimes che∣rishing him with your voice, and at other times striking him with your switch as you see occasion. Hang with your weight upon the Saddle, shake the Stirrups, strike them a∣gainst his sides, and strain the Crupper, with all such matters as will happen in ri∣ding, till he is familiar and seems well to brook them.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
<P>Your Horse by this means being plya∣ble to the Saddle, take off the slight, loose and easie Bridle. Gird the Saddle hard; then washing his mouth with ALE, you shall put into it a full mouth'd Trench, formerly used, and drawing the Reins o∣ver his head, lay them upon the Saddle, drawing them now and then, that he may have a feeling of the Trench, which will induce him to Champ, and play with the same, and thereby make him more famili∣ar with it; after which having your Martin∣gal in a readiness, fasten it from the Chaul∣band to the Girths, but with some slackness, unless your Horse is apt to toss up his head upon starting wantonness, or a col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he has got.</P>
<P>This done fasten a broad pecie of Lea∣ther about his neck at his withers, and be∣fore the middle of his weasand, about six inches beneath his Throple, between which and his neck let the Martingal be drawn, to prevent his ducking down his head: for by that means the Cavezan being placed upon the Gristle of his nose, being the tender∣est part about him, will when he throws down his head, hurt him, at that rate, that he will soon leave of that ill custom of ducking or thrusting his head between his legs, and make him carry it Archwise
<PB N="19" REF="23"/> bending like a Swans neck, which will add much to his comeliness; and thus use him for eight or ten days before you back him.</P>

<HEAD>Rules to be observed upon the first backing your Horse.</HEAD>
<P>YOur Horse being become patient of the Saddle and Trench, lead him in a Morning or Evening into some ploughed or other loose ground; and after divers turns essay to mount him often, till you find him patient of your burthen. Then hav∣ing one to hold his head, advance by de∣grees, shaking and moving your toes and body with equal motion, so that your Horse may perceive you, and so do divers times, cherishing and heartning him, till at length you dare trust him without any one to lead him: but venture not too quickly to ride him far, but make him more and more fa∣miliar by giving him bread, grass, and other provender out of your hands; and by of∣ten mounting and dismounting, and so con∣tinue him without much intermission till he will advance, stand, or turn at your dis∣cretion. Then lay by all but the Cave∣zan, Trenches and Martingal, and ride him forth, another riding on a Horse be∣fore you, and from a slow walk, trot or
<PB N="20" REF="24"/> pace him according as you find him dis∣posed; letting his lesson for the most part be either advancing fore-right, or standing still, sometimes suffering him to follow the Horse, and at others to ride equally with him; for having regard to the other Horse he will imitate him in his paces and carri∣age, in which you must be sure to mannage his head to the best advantage: for as he at first is used to carry it, so will he continue to do afterwards.</P>

<HEAD>Rules to be observed in the Management of a Horse to bring him to perfection.</HEAD>
<P>THe first thing to be considered is, to what end you design your Horse, ei∣ther to one particular service, or to all in ge∣neral; the former is plausible, but the lat∣ter judged by most impossible, for that no one Horse can perfectly retain so many les∣sons as belong to all exercises, as Hunting, Racing, War, Travailing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet in all these 'tis requisite that your Horse have a good mouth, Amble smoothly, Trot free∣ly, and without much provoking to it, lift∣ing his legs neither too high nor too low, that he gallop strongly and be in motion swift, ridding ground apace, being ready to
<PB N="21" REF="24"/> stop, advance, retire, or turn about upon all commands and occasions without any force or compulsion: But above all, Horses for the Wars ask most care and diligence to prepare and bring them to good order. Yet as to all sorts (reader) I shall give the best advice my judgement and experience is capable of laying down; but ere I proceed to the main points, and extraordinary rules to be ob∣served by the most accomplished Horse∣man, I shall take such Gradations as may the better inable the reader to discern and rightly understand my methods.</P>
<P>In mannagment of untaught Horses these seven things are to be observed and used, as occasion requires, either to correct or che∣rish your Horse, <HI>viz.</HI> the Whip, the Spur, the Stirrop, the Calves of the legs, the Curb or Snaffle, the Ground and voice: all which I leave to be used at the discretion of the rider as occasion offers, there being no certain rule for the use of them, though they are all much conducing to the mannage∣ment of a Horse, unless the ground which ought for breaking of Horses to be soft; and for Racing, Hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> firm and even.</P>

<HEAD>How to bring your Horse to the Mannagement of the Ring.</HEAD>
<P>YOur Horse throughly tamed and learned to advance, stop and turn without any seeming unwillingness; then riding him to some sandy or gravelly place, where the print of his footsteps may plainly be seen, incircle the ground by trotting for the space of 50 paces in compass, which done three or four times, rest on the right hand and cherish your Horse; then by moving him upon the Ring of the Circle, stop him upon the left hand, and let him rest, still incou∣raging him, and by often changing your hand and mending your pace, you will soon make him perfect, but upon every full stop make him retire a pace or two in the same manner, if you can, as when he trots forward.</P>
<P>Thus doing, your Horse will be ready upon all turns, and with little labour brought to understand your meaning in most things, and especially to gallop the Ring by degrees till he is capable of per∣forming it at full speed: Observe in turn∣ing about the Ring upon the gallop, whe∣ther your Horse when he leads to the
<PB N="23" REF="25"/> righthand, leads with his left forefoot, and in gallopping to the lefthand his right fore∣foot advances before the left; which if it so happen, then he will soon be expert at the Ring, and many other difficult exer∣cises. Which some Horses not doing, it had bred an opinion in Jockies and others, that it is not convenient to gallop the Ring; and their reason is for that by raising up his forefeet he gallops painfully; which is not, but when he carries them even: for if he set one before the other as aforesaid, it is easily performed, and if the Horse at first or second time do not observe it, yet in the end, for his own ease, he will practise it, and having practised it, continue it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to stop in a full Carreer, to Advance, Re∣tire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO stop your Horse on all occasions, whether upon Amble, Trot, or full Speed, you must observe suddainly to draw in your bridle-hand strait and steady, hard and sharp, and by that means you will make him stop firm, close and even; but if he turn sideways, or move forward, after you have drawn in your hand, then
<PB N="24" REF="26"/> put him to it again, till he obey your will. After you have taught him to stop, at∣tempt to make him advance upon your stop, that is, rise with his forelegs, which you may do by suddenly clapping the Calves of your legs close to his sides, and not touch∣ing him with spurs, and at the same time shaking your switch or whip over him, which will add much grace to his stopping; if at first he understands you not, try him again, and in five or six times tryal he will perform your desire.</P>

<HEAD>How to oblige your Horse to retire, and to indure all manner of Bitts.</HEAD>
<P>TO make your Horse retire, you must with a steddy Rein draw him back, so that with his legs lifted up as when he Trotteth forward, he must retreat three or four paces, which in a War-horse is extra∣ordinary necessary, and indeed commend∣able in all Horses brought up to the Sad∣dle; but you must observe to make him do it in a direct line, not turning to one side or the other, nor suffer him to shuffle in his retiring, but take his legs clever∣ly from the ground.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
<P>Your Horse perfected in the lessons a∣foresaid, if you design him for a War Horse, take away his Trench and Martingal, and leave only the Cavezan to be used of three or four pieces or joynts, <HI>viz.</HI> a joynt in the middle, and to it a strong Ring fastened, and on each side a joynt with Rings before them, to which divers Reins being fastned, you may use them to com∣mand your Horse as occasion requires, or if this be too hard for him, put into his mouth a Cannon-bitt made up with a French check, fitted to the proportion of your Horses neck, for if it be not proporti∣oned, there can be no true mannagement; for the long check elevates the Horses head, and the short one pulls it down. These are the material lessons at first to be learnt, which being perfected, are an Introduction to what remains, and ren∣ders it less difficult.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Turnings and strait Turns, what they are. And Rules to mannage your Horse in that affair.</HEAD>
<P>THe turnings are, when the face of the Horse is kept fixed on the Center or post, bearing about in circumference with his hinder parts, opposing his face to the face of his enemy.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
<P>The strait turns are when your Horse moving, keepeth his posteriors inwards, and close to the Center or post, and bear∣ing about makes the circumference, with his fore part advancing a little towards the enemy, that would avoid him.</P>
<P>The first strait turn is to be mannaged thus, to the Ring in the middle of your Cavezan fasten a rein, about three yards or somewhat more in length, and to the other two Rings two reins, somewhat shor∣ter. Then his bit and Saddle put on, bring him to the post, and there put the reins and bit over the Saddle-bolster and all, and so fasten them at such straitness to the Pummel, that he may feel them both. Then if you are desirous he should turn to the right, take the short rein on the left side of the Cavezan, and bringing it under the Saddles fore-bolster, up to the Pummel, fix it there, at such a straitness, that his head may be rather swayed from, than to the post, his eyes looking to the right, at what time let some one of your attendants hold the rein on the right side of the Cavezan at the post, moving it so that the fore-part of your Horses body may turn about at full. Then in your own hand take the long rein, causing him to bear his hinder-parts inwards, which you must do by striking him gently
<PB N="27" REF="27"/> on the outward shoulder, and outward buttock, as you see occasion, causing him to turn about the post; his hinder parts being the Center, whilst his fore-parts move the cir∣cumference: and thus use him on the one hand, till he is indifferent perfect; then by changing the rein on the other outward ring of the Cavezan, cause him to do it on the o∣ther hand, after the same manner. And so you must exercise him morning and even∣ing, till by a touch of your rod he couch his posteriors to the Post, and swiftly Trot round, still in his motion, placing the out∣ward fore leg over the inward, and so by degrees in his wheeling oblige him to mend his pace, swiftly, and distinctly, and in as direct a compass as can easily or convenient∣ly be performed; till at last he fly with such Celerity that his fore and hinder-legs move equal.</P>
<P>Your Horse having learned this lesson perfectly, mount his back, whilst your Groom holds the long rein, and another the short one, then with the motion of your hand upon the left rein of the Cavezan and bit, bearing his head from the post, and by the motion of the Calves of your legs, and your switch upon his outward thigh, causing him to bear his hinder parts to the Post; exercise him till he performs it
<PB N="28" REF="28"/> as well with you upon his back, as he did be∣fore. Then taking away the Cavezan, exercise him with the short rein only, and so by de∣grees having brought him to be perfect at the Post, you may exercise him without a Post in any open place, and this motion will pre∣pare him for all the following ones.</P>
<P>The straight turn is to keep his face to the Post, as if he were facing his enemy, swiftly flying about with his hinder parts: His head being the Center; the reins both long and short, must be used as before, on∣ly you must not give the short rein such scope, but drawing it nearer to the post; still as he moves about, follow his hinder parts with the long rein, and observe whether he bear his hinder legs in his motion one over the other, as is expressed by his fore legs, with the help of your rod, making him bring his hinder parts swiftly round the Post, as is before said; and when he is perfect, mount his back, and cause him with the foresaid usage to turn swift or slow, as you see occasion: then leaving the Post, exercise him in an open place, till he is per∣fect and expert in either turn, which will not only accomplish him for the Wars, but for Hunting, Racing, and all other matters that can be required in a Horse</P>

<HEAD>Approved rules to bring your Horse to a swift and smooth Amble, Trot, or Gallop, upon the least motion.</HEAD>
<P>DIvers opinions, and divers ways are there to bring a Horse to a true and graceful Amble, though indeed many or most of them fall short, it being a les∣son not learnt by any Horse without great difficulty; to Trot and Gallop well and graceful, being far more easie: But howsoever I shall direct you what courses to take, whereby it may the soonest be obtain∣ed. But before I give you my own opinion, I shall recite and confute the errors of those, that have deceived themselves and others, who have taken their measures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Then divers are of opinion that the only way to bring a Horse to a perfect Amble, is to trace him to and fro, in a new ploughed field, where the Mould is dry and soft; wherein they say he cannot with ease do any thing less than Amble: yet let me tell them, his Amble in such a case, will be rather a shuffling, than a true Amble; besides, it toils him so much that when he comes up∣on plain ground, remembring the slavery he was put to, he will rather fall into any
<PB N="30" REF="29"/> other pace, and forever after be put out of love with Ambling.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There are some who hold it the best way to oblige a Horse to fall from a gallop into an Amble, upon a suddain stop, made by checking with your bridle, and bearing forward, clapping the Calves of their Legs close to his sides: but this rule is altogether uncertain; besides, by such stops, they not only spoil their Horses mouths, and so lose the command of their rein upon divers occasions, but indanger their Horses; indammaging them by over straining, spraining their sinews, break∣ing their Hoofs, or the like.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Some, again, are for setting on shoos of an extraordinary weight, which makes a Horse interfere, and strike short; often indangering him with lameness, and for fear of striking, so slow is his pace, that he can never by that means be brought to a graceful Amble. Others load their Hor∣ses Fetlock-pasterns, by wrapping Lead about them, which is more hurtful and dangerous than the former, often creating strains, not curable, and by crushing or bruising the Crownet, cause Crown scabs, Ring-bones, Quitter-bones, and the like, to the utter disabling of the Horse. Others are of opinion that loading a Horse with pon∣derous
<PB N="31" REF="29"/> weights cross the Fillets, will ob∣lige him to Amble. But let me tell them, also and experience teach them, that if they of∣ten use that course, it will undoubted∣ly disable any Horse, by rendering him sway-backed, and weak in the hinder parts.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Many give their opinion that there is no way like teaching a Horse to Amble by hand after this manner: bring him, say they, to the side of a straight wall, Pail, or Rail, and having moved him a lit∣tle, a walking pace till he begins to be warm; then with your bridle-hand, you being on foot chock him, and at the same time with your rod fitly strike him on the hinder Houghs, and under his belly when he treads false, causing him to pace by degrees: But this Rule is uncertain, for it rather hares and frights the Horse, than any ways makes him understand what he is to do, obliging him to flounce, fly back, spraul, and rear himself on end, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which often used he will retain, and ever after, upon the least occasion, start and fly out, or very hardly be induced to leave them, or should he by this means be brought to any perfection in Ambling; yet when you are mounted on his back he will be far to seek, and not understand your
<PB N="32" REF="30"/> motions, so that it will prove but time spent in vain.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Many there are that hold a Horse may be brought to Amble, by having shoos clapped on his hinder feet, with long plates before the toes, by which means at every step the hinder foot may reach the fore foot; but this is not only incommodious, but dangerous: for in the first place the Horse must go shuffling, and can be put into no true Amble; in the next place, if he strike hard, he will cut, bruise or strain the sinews on the back of the forefoot, still beating the forelegs forward; which frequently causes halting and lameness not curable, there being no part about a Horse more tender.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Fine Lists, some hold best to Amble, which in this manner they propose; take say they, a fine List, twist it in the nature of a Cord, and drawing it strait about your Horses Cambrel, where Far∣riers are wont to garter them for a stiff strain, turn him to Grass, which cram∣ping of his sinews will for his ease make him know no other pace but the Amble; and perfect him in it, in a fortnight or three-weeks. This is altogether uncertain, for the Horse finding himself cramped, will on∣ly draw his legs after him, and shuffle un∣less
<PB N="33" REF="30"/> he be forced, and if the lists are drawn too strait, when they are taken off, the sinews will be so numbed that he will be only capable of crambling and cringing; and moreover it will greatly subject him to the string-halt, and often twitching up his legs.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> There still remain some that say there is no way like using your Horse to the Tramel, to oblige him to Amble, which indeed is the best method; yet since there are many errors and over-sights in it, I shall not think it amiss to lay them down in or∣der, and then proceed to give such rules as I conceive, and experience has proved, the best and readiest way, to bring your Horse to an easie, comely and graceful Am∣ble.</P>
<P>The first error is their not observing the fit and just length of the Tramel; for if it be too long and not capable of giving a stroke or too short, and by that means gives a false stroke.</P>
<P>The former makes the Horse move shuffling and after a confused manner, alto∣gether improper and indecent; &amp; the latter by the suddain twitches it obliges the Horse to make, subjects him to the string-halt, and other indecent motions of his feet.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="31"/>
<P>The Second error is in those who without a due proportion of their Tramel, will place it out of order, <HI>viz.</HI> fasten it above the knee of the foreleg, and about the fet∣lock of the hinderleg; when if it be too long, the foreleg cannot command the hinder to follow; and if it be too short and strait, so that the sinews and Ligaments are pres∣sed and girded, and that the foreleg and hinder must of necessity have equal moti∣on, then will the main sinews be greatly in∣jured in the hinder leg, as also the veins and Ligaments of the fore thighs, to the utter disabling of your Horse for a time, if not for ever: nor can he then move, but in a cram∣bling, shuffling and halting posture, altogether undecent and unprofitable; besides, it will by long chafing bring down the humours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Third Error, relating to the use of the Tramel, is when they that use it, make it of such course hard stuff that ei∣ther by girding it too strait, or leaving it too loose, it will either so gird or gall, that both skin and hair will be taken off, and so the Tramel rendred insufferable, and not answer the expectation of him that put it on.</P>
<P>The Fourth and last Error I shall expose to view, is the opinions of many, that the Tramel is altogether unnecessary, alledging
<PB N="35" REF="31"/> Ploughed land most feezable, which is more an error in those that assert it, than the Tra∣mel is useless or erroneous; for the Tramel in my opinion rightly applyed, is the only means to bring your Horse to a true Amble, the use of it being made as followeth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The most approved and Experienced way to make a Horse Amble true and compleat.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you design to teach your Horse the true Amble, first by leading him a racking pace in your hand, observe to what motion he is most inclinable: whe∣ther Trot, Running, Bastard-Amble or other, then mount him, and racking him delibe∣rately, force him to advance by the help of his Mouth-Weeks, with his Snaffle, which must be full, smooth and large. Press him gently on both sides with the Calves of your legs, and now and then a gentle touch with the Spur, if by that means you can oblige him to strike into an Amble; but above all be sure you do not by too much chafing, or too strong a hand disor∣der, or force him to distort either his Mouth, Neck or Head; and if he do fall into an Amble, as it were of his own accord, though not perfect, yet; it is greatly promising that he will soon be induced to a pleasant
<PB N="36" REF="32"/> Amble by the help of Art, and cause him with more patience and less danger to in∣dure the Tramel, by reason the motion without stumbling, flying out, or the like, becomes natural. And now the next thing to be considered is the form of the true Tramel and its use, divers there are that make them of Leather, some of Canvas, and others of Lists: but all of them are uncertain and in∣commodious, by reason the first will de∣ceive the Horse and the Rider by stretch∣ing; the second disable the Horse by gal∣ling him, and the third doth stretch and hang loose, by reason of its softness: there∣fore the best way, though many ways there are in use, besides what I have mentioned, is to make your Tramel of strong pack∣thred, twisted into a cord, about the thick∣ness of a Jack-line, hard and well dried, of which form your Tramel thus: let your side cords be so firm that they will not give the least way; let the hose, or part fasten∣ed about his legs be close, soft and immove∣able; the backbands light and somewhat broad, the better to avoid hurting your Horses fillets, the length of the side Ropes must be just 36. inches; or if the Horse be of a long reach, an inch may be added but no more, and so equal in length they must be, that the difference of a straws breadth
<PB N="37" REF="32"/> must not be perceived; the hose must be placed on the small of the foreleg and upon the hinderleg, just above the fetlock, made of Girth-web, lined with Flannel, Cotton or some such soft matter, fastened with Neats-leather Tabs, made supple by tallowing, of an even length, in which di∣vers holes must be punched at an even di∣stance, to pass through the nooses which are to be on the side ropes, so that by buckling them with strong buckles; the said ropes may be drawn up or let out at pleasure, the Tabs not to exceed 10 in∣ches, nor the holes in them four in∣ches.</P>
<P>This done, let your back bands, whose use is to hold up the side Cords (if you Tramel all your Horses legs) be made of Girth web, lined with Flannel or the like, to prevent galling; but if you Tramel but two of his legs, Filleting or strong Tape will serve; but you must be careful that it main∣tains the side cords in an even line, with∣out either twitching it up, or suffering it to fall, for these are gross defects and great hindrances, for rising shortens the side cord, and falling makes it apt to intan∣gle the Horse.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="33"/>
<P>This being the manner of making the right Tramel: I shall now proceed to give my Reader a description of its perfect use; as thus, bring your Horse into an even place, not too hard or stony, and there putting on his hose on the near legs be∣fore and behind; fasten to them the side cords, as aforesaid, the Horse standing as even as possible, not straining forward nor crimpling inward, but to his just and due pro∣portion; lay the side ropes fastned by Girth∣web or Tape to the Saddle, then laying your hand on the Bridle, oblige him by strain∣ing his head gently to move forward, or if you perceive it requisite, let another assist you in forcing him forward, whiles you compel him to Amble about the ground, for that purpose chosen, as leisurely as possibly, using him with all gentleness and often cherishing him with your voice, till he feel the Tramel, and begin to understand what he is to perform: And although he stum∣ble or fall now and then, at his being brought to the Tramel, yet in a while he will grow perfect, if you be not too harsh towards him: But when he falls, rather cherish him, by permitting him to rise at his leisure, than seem harsh towards him; for by that means he will find out his own failings, and amend them, and soon understand the
<PB N="39" REF="33"/> motion he is designed for; and in your hand Amble to your liking, though it is not amiss if at first, when he begins to learn, that you permit the side ropes to be longer than the measure, before specified, to prevent the suddain twiches, till he is used to the Tramel; but when he begins to be perfect, be sure they be of a constant length, lest the over length render him a slow Ambler, or the under length cause him to halt or shuffle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What time the Tramel may be altered and when it is most convenient to mount his back to jour∣ney, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOur Horse being brought perfectly to Amble by hand, you may change the half Tramel, removing it from one side, and placing it on the other, and as you see oc∣casion put on the whole Tramel, till he run swiftly without the motion of snappering or stumbling, after which try him upon uneven and uncertain ways, up &amp; down hill, over clumpers and false footing, that so he may in his Amble answer all Roads; for di∣vers Horses there are that will Amble smoothly and decently upon even ground, but when they happen upon rough and stony ways, fall into a hard trot shuffling
<PB N="40" REF="34"/> or an ill favoured pace, out of which it is very difficult to force them.</P>
<P>The Horse being thus tryed and no diffi∣culty appearing, mount his back or set ano∣ther to do it, whilst your self by staying his head, keep him from any ill conveniency, and take a narrow view how he treads his steps; after which, your self mounting him and often cherishing him, may oblige him, to mend his pace, till he move with as much agility as you can desire: yet forget not between whiles to put on sometimes the half Tramel, and at other times the whole Tramel, often shifting them from one side to the other, lest your Horse should for∣get his pace; and in so doing twice or thrice a day, you will bring him in a Month or six weeks to the heighth of perfection.</P>
<P>Thus far having proceeded, you may without any Tramel ride him upon the road for three or four miles, not picking or chusing your way, but taking the uneven with the even, and if you perceive him to baulk his Amble, then having the half Tra∣mel about you, put it on, which will soon put him in mind of what he is to perform; but if you perceive any impediment that caused him to forsake his Amble, remove it, and then try him again without the Tramel; for there is nothing belonging
<PB N="41" REF="34"/> to Horsemanship that is not requisite to be used on this occasion, or to be left off as occasion requires, <HI>viz.</HI> the chain, Head∣strain, Cavezan, Musroul, Martingal, Bit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus much touching what relates to instruction for Ambling shall suffice, it not being in the least to be questioned, but if these rules are observed, the Reader will have his desire.</P>
<P>As to Trotting and Galloping, they are paces so ordinary and so easie to be attain∣ed, that I need not much inlarge on them, as for the Trot, it is of two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lofty or Prancing Trot, and the common or Running Trot. To oblige your Horse to the first of these, you must perfect him at the Post, as is before recited; after which putting on a strong Curb-Bit, by bearing him up, shortning your rein by twisting it about your Bridle hand, oblige him to bend his neck Arch∣wise, not any ways inclining it to one side or the other, but foreright; and by using him to it, he will at length keep his head and neck in the same posture when you ride him with a Snaffle, after which fasten a strong strap to his Girth under his belly, and bringing it between his forelegs, fasten it pretty strait to the Curb, or Chain of the Bridle, and then mounting your
<PB N="42" REF="35"/> Horse, hold the reins with a steddy hand and cause your Horse to move forward, some∣times striking him upon the hinder thighs with your rod, and at other times cherish∣ing him, at what time feeling his head straitned, between the under and upper rein, he will lift his forefeet high, treading short in a proud prancing manner, which by often usage will make him perfect in it; when the under rein is taken away. As for the other Trot, the grace of it being when it is swift and smooth, the only way is at the first breaking of your Horse, to set a full bodied man upon him, whose weight will so ballance him, that he cannot let his feet fall from such a height, or with so strong a spring to jolt the Rider, by reason he will not be capable of lifting them so high. Another way to oblige him to an easie Trot, is by loading him at his first bereaking with heavy shoos, which will make him Trot more deliberately, and with less sha∣king his body, to offend his Rider.</P>
<P>As for Galloping, it is divided into two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> Hand-gallop, and Fullgal∣lop, or Full-speed, to either of which a skillful rider, by the mannagement of the rein, and use of Whip or Spur, may oblige a free Horse at his pleasure: Wherfore I shall no longer insist on them, but conclude this
<PB N="43" REF="35"/> part of Horsemanship, the most material of all others, and from it I shall proceed to ad∣vise the keeper what in his place is most convenient to be done, both for the credit of himself and the advantage of his Ma∣ster.</P>

<HEAD>Rules to be well considered and exactly observed by all that undertake the care of good Hor∣ses.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst other things appertaining to a Horse, good looking to is not the least, for if he fare never so well, if he be not carefully looked after, at all conveni∣ent seasons, he will not thrive; there∣fore for their better understanding, to whom such offices appertain, I shall lay down these following Rules.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Rising in Summer-time about Sun rising, and in Winter-time by break of day, enter the Stable, having over-night prepared three pints or thereabouts of dry Oats well sifted, and added to them a pint of split Beans, give them your Horse, the which when he has eaten, fall to dressing him, currying him over with your Iron Comb, leaving no part undone, then with your dusting cloth dust him over, or for want of that with a Horse tail, after which
<PB N="44" REF="36"/> with your French brush beginning at his forehead, proceed by degrees to rub every part of him leaving not so much as the breadth of an inch untouched throughout him; then dust him again, and with your wet hand lay and smooth his hair, then dry∣ing your hand, dry the wet places with the same, not forgetting to cleanse his Sheath, Cods, Yard, Tuel, Forebowels, Ears, Nostrils, and all other places that are subject, to sweat or filth; this done, with your hair-cloth rub him over in all parts, but especially his Head, Cheeks, Face and Eyes, the top of his forehead and between his chaps, then with a woollen Cloth kept clean for that purpose, rub him over again in all parts, and lastly comb down his Main and Tail.</P>
<P>The Horse thus put into good order, Sad∣dle him and lead him out of the Stable, where mounting his back, ride him gently to water, but so that you may a little warm his stomach: then having permitted him to drink a considerable draught, Rack him gently ere you bring him into the Sta∣ble; having done that, though not made him sweat, bring him into the Stable, ha∣ving his cloaths ready; as soon as you have rubbed him down, put them on, and so let him stand for the space of an hour, at
<PB N="45" REF="36"/> which time give him two quarts of Beans and Oats mingled as aforesaid, which being eaten, toss into his Rack a hard knop of hay, and let him bite upon it till noon; noon being come, furnish him with the like quantity of Beans and Oats and the like knop of Hay, if the former knop be eaten, or else not.</P>
<P>Evening being come, carefully dress him, after the same manner as in the morning you did, and so ride him to wa∣ter, warming him before you permit him, to drink, as likewise afterwards bring him into the Stable, clothing him and rub∣bing him down without any alteration, and after an hours standing give him Beans, Oats and Hay to the quantity aforesaid; that is three pints of Oats one of spelt Beans, and a knop of Hay, and let him stand till Nine of the Clock at night, at what time renewing his Bait, and tossing up his Litter, leave him till morning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to order your Horse when you design him for Sport, or Travail. And how in and af∣ter Travel, Sport, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen you intend to take a journey, see the day and night before, that your Horse have his due proportion of
<PB N="46" REF="37"/> meat, and be well rubbed down, clean Littered, and served with warm water in the Stable without leading him abroad; and either with Trotters, oyl Neatsfoot-Oyl, or Dogs Greace, which it behoves you to have in a readiness, supple the joynts of fore and hinderlegs, it being warmed over a fire, which will not only make him nimble in his Travail, but hold out much better than otherwise he would. In the morn∣ing let him have his Beans and Oats, but no Hay. If you find him lively and met∣tlesome, give him no water before you ride out, but being mounted ride him a mile or two, a racking pace, and when you find him well heated, ride him as you please, either Amble, Trot or Full-speed, you cannot hurt him; but be sure to ob∣serve when you come into your Inn, that you with your Glazing Knife ere you rub him down, take off the sweat) the knife so called, is made of an old Sword blade or a piece of a Scithe) after which rub him down, and cleanse him as you have been formerly shewed. Then he having eaten his allowance of meat, which must for conveniencies sake be double what at once you are to give him when he stands idle; you must if you find him any thing hot, give him warm water, but if he be
<PB N="47" REF="37"/> indifferent cool, cold water will not pre∣judice him.</P>
<P>Having after a journey, heat, or the like, brought home your Horse, hot or tyred, bring him not into the Stable till he be pretty well dryed, and cooled by mode∣rate walking; when being entred the Stable, and tyed up to the Rack, rub him down as you have been shewed before, and girt his cloaths fast about him: Tucking some drie wisps between his body and the Girths, and when he has stood on the Bridle for the space of two hours; toss a knop of Hay into the Rack, whilst you prepare your Oats and Beans to the quantity of two quarts, amongst which it will not at all be amiss, but rather profitable, if you mix half a pint of Hempseed well cleansed; and at night when he comes to receive his last bait, give him warm water mix∣ed with a small quantity of fine Oat∣meal, and so tossing up his Litter let him rest till Morning.</P>
<P>As to washing and walking your Horse after a journey; I hold them both dange∣rous; the former occasioning surfeits, and the latter contagious colds turning into the Glanders, and other both troublesome and noysome infirmities. But if he be extraordinary dirty, take a pail of warm
<PB N="48" REF="38"/> water, and having first scraped off the dirt, rub him with a wet brush till he become clean. If he be hot and not fit∣ting to be Stabled, then ride him gently up and down, till you find him temperate and cool; but in no wise walk him in your hand, lest the dullness of the moti∣on conspiring with the cold diseases damp his courage, and by that means subject him to divers infirmities. And thus much for our Keeper. Now I shall proceed to give instructions to the Feeder; though indeed the Keeper and the Feeder are in a manner one and the same: But since much remains in that nature, in order to prepare a Horse for Racing, Hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I shall lay down Rules and Methods apart, such as will not only (if rightly observed) save great charges, but more speedily than what has yet been publickly known) fit and prepare Horses for all Noble recreations. And First, for Racing or Running Hor∣ses.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Rules to be observed in preparing and order∣ing your Horse designed to Run, according to the condition he is in, and the temper of his body.</HEAD>
<PB N="49" REF="38"/>
<P>THe chief thing, when you have match∣ed your Horse, or are about to match him, that is requisite to be observed, is the state of his body; but especially whether he be Foul, Fat, or newly taken from Soil, or Grass; whether through excessive riding or other hard usage, he be reduced to leanness or affli∣cted with any infirmitie; or whether he is in a good and likely condition, through kindly usage and gentle breathings: and according to these observations, proportion your time, in order to fit and prepare your Horse to per∣form your desire. Two months being the longest time you need desire, be he in the worst of the conditions aforesaid, if the following instructions be exactly observed, the worst of which is his being Foul and Fat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by reason the Grease must be brought away, before he can be fit, for this extraordi∣nary exercise; six weeks, if he be lean, for then his feeding and exercise need not be distinct in days, but every day both of them put in practice, as for a Horse in good case, and free from infirmity: I hold that a month is sufficient, if he be carefully looked after to prepare him.</P>
<P>These things considered, the next is to observe whether your Horse, if fat, by extraordinary exercise, is so tender that he
<PB N="50" REF="39"/> loses his flesh and falls away; if so, you must be more moderate in your exer∣cise, and tender over him; but if you find him hardy, and of a free spirit, then you must keep him up to it, and he will prove the better. Again, if your lean Horse be of a free temper, and feeding upon all meats, will get his flesh up apace, and not lose it by exercise; then you need not be so ten∣der over him, and the like must be obser∣ved by your Horse in the middle state, al∣ways taking special notice of their Limbs; that there harbour no defect; for if so, your labour will be greatly hazzarded, if not altogether lost.</P>
<P>Having thus far proceeded, I shall now lay down Rules for dieting your Horse, in preparing for your match, and by reason that all the three before mentioned may be said to be contained in the fat Horse; I shall first begin with him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The manner of the first fortnights diet for a Horse that is fat and foul, or upon his be∣ing taken from soil or grass, and what is necessary therein to be observed.</HEAD>
<P>YOur fat and foul Horse, made so by either standing at soil, or running at grass, too high feeding or the like: If you have matched him, or intend so to do; when you have brought him into your Stable,
<PB N="51" REF="39"/> to prepare him for the Race, rising early the first fortnight, you must first of all, having roused him, if he be laid, wash his Bridle in Beer or Ale, tie it to the rack; and cleanse the Stable of the Horses ex∣crements, and then exceedingly well dress him. For the manner whereof, to avoid repetition, I refer you to be guided by those Rules, I have laid down in the Office of the Keeper, in the Chapter of this book, unless what is necessary to be ad∣ded, as being in this case necessary, though in the general way of dressing, not great∣ly material, which principally relate to your Horses cloathing. For by reason the Heats in preparing your Horse for this exercise, must be more, and frequenter than upon any other occasion: So therefore must the care be great, to prevent his catch∣ing cold; falling into a surfeit or the like. When you have well dressed him in the morning, and cleansed him from filth, leaving no part about him untouched, as aforesaid, having a large body-cloth made of strong warm Kersie, if the weather be cold; or if hot, Cotten, or other light soft stuff will serve: Fold it about his body, and putting on his Saddle, let his foremost girth be girded close, but the other loose, thrusting in large soft wisps of Straw near his
<PB N="52" REF="40"/> heart, that so the slack girth may by the help of the wisps be made strait as the o∣ther: then put on a warm breast cloth, so that it may cover his shoulders. When having spirted about three or four sponfulls of beer into his mouth; then leaving one to prepare the Stable against your return, lead him forth, and after a turn or two in your hand, mount his back, and rack him gently, for the space of a mile or more, up∣on plain and even ground, till you can, if possible, come to some steep Hill, ascend∣ing gradually, up which gallop him mo∣derately, and being come to the top, or so high as you think convenient; Rack or walk him down again, that, by that means he may cool as much in descend∣ing, as he heated in ascending; and having after this manner pretty well exercised him, it being yet early in the morning, lead him or ride him a moderate pace to some pleasant River, Spring or other sweet run∣ning water, and suffer him to drink as much as he pleases, but if he altogether refuses to drink, then moderately exercise him; as aforesaid, but if he refuse to drink, warm him by riding gently, to provoke him to thirst.</P>
<P>When your Horse has drank his fill, rack
<PB N="53" REF="40"/> him gently homewards, so that he may come into the Stable without a wet hair; the stable being fresh littered with Wheat-Straw (for Barly, or Rye Straw are both nought: the one causing heart burning and the other scowring) by whistling and stretching your Horse upon the cast out Litter, indeavour to make him void urine, the which if he at first decline to do, yet at last, by often usage, he understanding what is re∣quired of him, will do it freel, and by so do∣ing preserve the stable clean, and render it more healthy: this done and your Horse entred the Stable, keeping his head in the bridle, tye it up to the Rack, then with hard wisps, rub down his legs with all your strength; then taking off his brest-cloth, rub his head, neck and breast, with care and diligence, with a dry cloth, after which take off his Saddle, and hang it up, rubbing the place where it sat, as likewise all the other parts of his body. His body cloth being taken off, and when you have suffici∣ently rubbed him, leaving no place un∣touched, cloath him again, first by spread∣ing a Linnen cloth over him, and girding it about him; upon that a warm housing cloth, and over both the Woollen body-cloth, which in winter must be lined with Cotten, or some other warm stuff; but in
<PB N="54" REF="41"/> Summer it matters not whether it be lined or no, for the Kersie will then prove suffi∣cient. This done wisp him round with soft wisps, though large, that so when he is disposed to rest, he may lie easie. From this proceed to pick his feet, and ha∣ving cleared them of the Gravel or dirt, stop them with Cowdung; and throw in∣to his Rack a small bottle of Hay, not exceeding three pound, and let it be well dusted, the which let him eat, and stand up∣on the Bridle for the space of an hour and half; then cleaning the Manger of dust and Hayseeds, take about a quart of large white Oats, commonly known by the name of <HI>Poland</HI> Oats, or cut Oats, these above all others being the wholesomest, the rest some being unsweet breed infirmities, othersome being moist breed Worms in the belly; new Oats occasion swelling, and Black-Oats worst of all cause ill di∣gestion and bad humours, thereby so dis∣colouring the dung, that the state of the Horses body is not thereby to be known.</P>
<P>The quantity of Oats aforesaid, well dryed, put into a Riddle or Sieve, called a reeing sieve, so big as it will permit the small and light Oats to pass through, and retain the large and solid ones; and by reeing them after they are throughly cleansed, give
<PB N="55" REF="41"/> them your Horse to eat in the Manger, it being made clean, as aforesaid. If he eat them heartily, and seem desirous of more, you may then give him another like quantity so ordered, and then permit him to stand or lie down at his pleasure, till about Eleven of the Clock. At which time, coming to visit him, rub down his Head, Neck, Face and Chest; and give him about three pints of Oats ordered as before; and then making the Stable as close and dark as you can, leave him for the space of two hours, for the closer the Stable is, and the darker the Horse stands, the better will he take his rest, and digest his food: Therefore many hang their Stalls round and over head with Canvas, or other thick cloaths. Nor is it amiss, for it not only darkens the place, but prevents any noisome thing from falling into their Provender, as Lime Spiders, dust, and the like.</P>
<P>The two hours ended, accost him again, with the like quantity of Oats as before; drest and prepared, after the same manner, rubbing over his Head, Face, Neck and Breast with a clean cloth; and if he hath dunged, carry it forth, and cast up his Litter, which done, cast a knop of Hay into his Rack, leave him for three hours more; if in Summer; but if in Winter two
<PB N="56" REF="42"/> hours, or two and a half; at the expiration of which time, visit him again, and with∣out giving him any meat, wash his Bridle in Beer, and put it on; taking off his cloaths by degrees, and rubbing him all over in the manner as has been formerly shewed; then clapping on his Saddle, bring him forth, and endeavour to make him empty himself upon the old Litter; and so mount his back gently, Racking him for an hour, or thereabout, and then if possible give him his breathings, along the side of some plea∣sant River; but do not gallop him up any hill, for that upon a full stomach, will in∣danger his Wind; so that observe to let his evening breathings be in smooth solid ground as you can chuse: and heat him both before and after water, as in the Morning, letting him smell to all the old or new Horse dung you find in the way, which will not only provoke him to empty, but sharpen his appetite, and so continuing him abroad till night approach, (for early and late Airings are the most proper to di∣minish the foulness, and disperse the gross humours) bring him home, and having caused him to empty at the Stable door, draw his Bridle, cleanse the Manger, and at all points dress him, and rub him down as in the morning, and then giving him a
<PB N="57" REF="42"/> like quantity of Oats; let him stand upon his Bridle till about nine of the Clock, then visit him again, when rubbing him down and tossing up his Litter; give him another quart of Oats well sifted, and a knop of Hay, and so let him remain till the next morning, at which time use him as you did the morning already specified, and thus continue him without adding or diminish∣ing ought for the first fortnight, which will put him into so good a temper that in the beginning of the second fortnight, his foul∣ness being dispelled, you may give him considerable heats without offence; but if you perceive his fatness and foulness, not to be wasted and gone, use him the more moderately, for the space of four or five days longer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Rules to be observed in giving your Horse heats, during the time of his prepara∣tion.</HEAD>
<P>OBserve that two heats in one week are as much as are convenient for any Horse, of what state or temper of body soever.</P>
<P>That one of these heats be given him upon the day he is to run the match, is most
<PB N="58" REF="43"/> requisite, as thus; if your match be to be performed upon a <HI>Tuesday,</HI> then let <HI>Tuseday</HI> and <HI>Saturday</HI> in every week be your heating days, and observe that on <HI>Tuseday,</HI> you give him the greatest heat, for two reasons; first because 'tis the day whereon he is to run for the wager; and for that there are three whole days respite between, and so pro∣portion your day to this space and observa∣tion of whatever day the match is to be run, unless by reason of Rainy Slabby wea∣ther; for if it rains, you must defer to heat him till the Rain be over, and the weather clear up: and in this case, where you are to make a vertue of necessity, you may change the hours of your heats, as the wea∣ther will permit.</P>
<P>In dull dripping or damp weather, when you ride abroad, you must put your Horse on a warm Linnen hood, with ears, and the nape of the neck thickned with a lining, to keep out the rain and cold damp; as likewise a cloth to keep the wet from falling upon the Fillets of your Horse; for nothing will more subject him to infirmity than wet in the ears, upon the nape of the neck, and on the Fillets.</P>
<P>The next and last observation relating to heats, is that in seasonable weather, eve∣ry morning by day spring, you have your
<PB N="59" REF="43"/> Horse abroad; but not before, and especi∣ally on those days you are to give your heats.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Rules to be observed in the second fortnights keeping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe first fortnight thus over, the first day of the subsequent fortnight vi∣sit your Horse early, as before, toss up his Litter, cleanse his Stable, rub him down, and dress him at all points, as you have been instructed: With this diffe∣rence, that before you bridle him, you shall give him somewhat upwards of a quart of Oats before you put on his Bridle, and give him no Hay at any time, but what he eats out of your hand, whether it be one, two or three handfuls at a time, according as he is disposed to eat it, it mat∣ters not; when he has eaten his Oats, bridle him, and ride him forth: then let his airing, waterings and his being brought home be no∣thing different from his usage in the first fortnight, and when you return with him, give him another quart of Oats, or if it be near three pints, if his stomach serve him to eat them, it matters not, and let him take the Hay out of your hand, as a∣foresaid, then toss up his Litter; dress him at all points, letting him stand on his Bridle
<PB N="60" REF="44"/> an hour and half before he is rubbed throughly. And now in his feeding, this more than formerly must be observed, take a stale loaf of bread of three days old at least: The manner of making of it is thus.</P>
<P>Grind three Pecks of Beans, with one Peck of Wheat into fine flower or Meal, dressed through an indifferent fine range, and made up with sweet Yest, and a little spring water, kneaded very painfuly and through∣ly, and suffer it then to lie in the trough a space to rise and become light; then knead it again, and so make it into loaves, as big as sixpeny ones, and let them soak well in an Oven; then taken out hot turn them the up side down, and suffer them in that manner to cool.</P>
<P>Three days after the baking and not before, for fear of surfeiting your Horse, you may cut the bread into thin shivings, and laying it a while to dry, put in amongst the Oats, crumbling it small, and give it your Horse, not exceeding more bread than a pound and a half at a time, the Oats you mix it with being carefully sifted. This Bait given in the morning first of all, you may about Ele∣ven of the Clock give him another portion of Bread and Oats, not differing from the former, and use the like ceremonies in dres∣sing and rubbing him; never forgetting
<PB N="61" REF="44"/> to cleanse the Stable, if occasion require it</P>
<P>This done, let him rest for the space of two hours, and then again visit him, and give him a like dose, and so the fourth meal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nothing being omitted in his dressing, Airing, Watering or Heats, unless the lat∣ter be prevented by the weather as afore∣said.</P>
<P>On the heating days observe that before you lead your Horse forth, you must only give him his quantity of Oats, without either Bread or Hay, and be sure to cool him well before you bring him into the Stable, and when he is in, let him be well dressed, and warmly cloathed; standing up∣on his Bridle an hour ere you give him his Oats, which being well ordered, must not exceed a quart; after the eating of which having a Muzzel ready washed, put it on, and so without any more ceremony permit him to rest till about nine in the evening: and about nine coming to him after you have dressed and tossed up his Lit∣ter, give him a quart of Oats; but no Bread nor Hay. Then tucking him up with soft wisps, let him rest till the morning fol∣lowing. Now since it is come to my turn to speak of the Muzzel, I shall for the better satisfaction of my Horse-keeper discourse
<PB N="62" REF="45"/> something relating to them, as to their use in general, and goodness in particular.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Horses Muzzels, their use and goodness.</HEAD>
<P>THe use of the Muzzel, is to pre∣vent the Horse from feeding up∣on his Litter; biting or gnawing the boards, Rack-staves or Manger; licking Loam∣walls, eating of Hen-dung, or any filthy or noisome thing that may impair his health or hinder his feeding.</P>
<P>As for Muzzels, there are divers kinds and divers fashions, some useful and profita∣ble, and others exceeding hurtful; of these in their order.</P>
<P>The Muzzel made of Leather, and stamp∣ed full of holes, for divers reasons ought to be rejected. First, forasmuch as it is noi∣some and offensive, be it of what leather it will. Secondly, if it be made of Allomed Leather, as often it happens, it causes pains in the Horses head. Thirdly, if it be liquored, the grease causes dulness, and makes the Horse loath his meat, rendering him sick and uneasie, preventing his rest, and to his prejudice making him retain his dung longer than otherwise he would.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="45"/>
<P>Another Muzzel there is made of Pack∣thread knit indifferent close at the bottom, and widening upwards, to the knitting a∣bout the nape of the neck, and this if it be made of sweet and well dried, and twisted Packthread, is the most proper, best and commodious for Summer.</P>
<P>The third and last sort which I shall here mention, is made of double Canvas, ha∣ving a round bottom bared over with small Tape, in the manner of a chequer, leaving square holes about a quarter of an inch each way for the Horse to take Air at, and fasten∣ed by loops and strings to the nape of his neck; and this is most proper for Win∣ter, but observe, that both this and the Packthread one must be often washed and made clean, lest they become noisome and unsavory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>An account of what further remains to be done the second fortnight.</HEAD>
<P>THe discourse relating to the Muzzels, occasion'd my abrupt breaking off be∣fore I had finished my second fortnight: waving that digression I shall proceed.</P>
<P>The first heating day past, the second morning after coming to the Stable, if you find your Horse laid, permit him to take his
<PB N="64" REF="46"/> ease; but if on his feet, rub a quart of Oats between your hands, having first dip∣ed them in Bear or Ale, and give them your Horse, but not too moist.</P>
<P>Having eaten the Oats, uncloath and dress him as has been shewed, then hang∣ing up his Muzzel, put on his Bridle, per∣mitting his breast and body cloths to re∣main on, drawing his head aloft, and putting into his mouth a new laid Egg, which you must oblige him to swallow, and after it about half a pint of Beer or Ale, then lead him forth, causing him to empty him∣self upon the cast Litter, or by smelling to old dung. When taking his back, rack him gently for a mile or two, then put him to a harder pace, as a hand-gallop or the like, and bring him to the starting post, if there be any one appointed, or if not to some other post near the place, where you are to perform your Race, and there alighting take of the body and breast cloaths, putting on the Saddle again, without them, and mounting him agin make him smell to the said post, as likewise to the weighing post; &amp; then run him at three quarters speed, from the beginning of the intended Race to the end, if you perceive he will hold it with∣out pain or loss of wind; but if you perceive it troublesome to him, then slacken your
<PB N="65" REF="46"/> pace, and so by degrees you will oblige him to perform that with delight, which o∣therwise would prove irksome to him, and above all observe narrowly upon what ground he best delighteth to run, whether it be smooth, hilly, soft, hard, dank or dry, and on that mannage both before and at the Race, if the course will afford it, to your best advantage.</P>
<P>Having coursed your Horse sufficiently, bring him under some Hay or Corn Rick, Hedg, Pit or dry-ditch, and there having taken off the sweat with your glazing knife, and rubbed him pretty well, put on his cloaths, and on his back clap his Saddle fast girded; then without permitting him to stand longer, still gently gallop him till he grows cool, now and then rubbing his head and such parts of his body as you can reach without alighting, and so continuing sometimes Racking, other times Galloping, till you come to the Stable door, and there, observing him to be cool, intice him to empty, which done lead him in and ty∣ing his head up to the Rack, having this scouring or purging potion in a readiness, give it him in the form and manner fol∣lowing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="66" REF="47"/>
<HEAD>The Receipt how to make the first scouring, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Ingredients must be an ounce &amp; six grains of clarified Roach Allom, a pint of Cannary, into which put the Allom when beaten into fine powder, &amp; add to them three ounces of Olive Oyl the best you can get, brewing and beating them together, with an ounce and an half of brown Sugar Candy pulverized, all w<SUP>ch</SUP> though roughly mixed, set upon a gentle fire till they are pretty hot, then letting them stand till they are bloodwarm, give them your Horse upon his return from his first heat, by pouring it down his throat with a drenching-horn, his head being drawn close to the Rack, and this will infallibly bring away the Molten-grease, and such other bad humours or obstructions as remain in his body.</P>

<P>THe scouring Potion taken, rub him well, especially his legs (his cloth being taken off and proving dry) with a curry-comb all over the body, after which
<PB N="67" REF="47"/> follow with your brush, and then dust him well, and let all his body again be rubbed over with dry cloaths, then putting his cloaths on again, truss him on either side with warm wisps, and cast over him a loose blanket, after which give him nothing more for the space of two hours, all which time you must watch him, and as near as you can, keep him in continual motion, it being dangerous to permit him to stand still, or sleep upon the reception of this potion, and besides, it will not so well operate up∣on the crude gross humours, unless the Horse be still moving.</P>
<P>At the end of two hours, or if you see occasion, somewhat more, give him a hand∣ful of Wheat ears, such as are not beard∣ed, if you find upon your handling him on his Fillets, near his Heart, under his Ears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that no new sweat arises, but that he is in good temper; but if the contrary, then for∣bear to give him ought; for then the foulness appearing by the swift beating of the heart, the new sweat and other sym∣ptoms are mightily stirred up, it is con∣venient they should operate without the least molestation, though your Horse thereupon appear to be sick and faint; to ease which, you may take off his Bridle, toss up his Litter, and leave him to take
<PB N="68" REF="48"/> his rest for the space of two hours or there∣about, at the end of which his sickness will vanish.</P>
<P>The wheat ears eaten by five or six at a time, give him a knop of Hay, rubbing him again, especially his head; about an hour after mix a quarter of Oats, a pint of spelt-beans and three shivers of the aforesaid bread, well chipped and small crumbled and give them to him, letting him rest af∣ter the eating them for the space of three hours.</P>
<P>The three hours expired, visit him again, and before you dress him, give him a like quantity of Oats, Beans and Bread, and then dressing well, put on his cloathes and ride him not far, neither suffer him to drink; but about an hour and a half afterwards wash three pints of Oats in Ale or Beer and give them to him to cool him, which will be a great means to repel the inward heat; and feeding at his usual times plenti∣fully, and leaving a knop of Hay in his Rack, you may suffer him to rest till mor∣ning, when rising early you must dress him at all points, and ride him forth to water, giving him a gentle breathing, and upon his return to the Stable give him Oats and spelt Beans well sifted together with the Bread, to the quantity of two quarts
<PB N="69" REF="48"/> permitting him to have but little Hay.</P>
<P>Thus having ordered him diligently, observe the three other heating days, up∣on each of which after he has performed his, heat still improving his speed and rea∣diness, give him the aforesaid scouring potion, which will infallibly carry away the foulness, and gross humours, rendering your Horse pleasant and lightsome, and thus having laid down rules and instructions for the first and second Fortnight, I shall proceed to the third.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Dyet for the third Fortnight, how it must be made, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MIngle together half a bushel of the best Wheat, and a like quantity of Beans, grind them as small as may be, and dress the meal finer than the former, even as fine as possible, and make it into Dough, with sweet yest, and rising kneading it so well that a knot or kop may not be found in it, and bake it throughly, cooling it, the Loaves proportionable to those before mentioned, with the bottoms upward, and at three days old chip it; that is, cut away the crust, and so with a like quantity of Oats, Beans, and of the said Bread, as for∣merly has been prescribed, feed your
<PB N="70" REF="49"/> Horse; and as you did in the precedent fort∣night; so in this let your measures in every respect, be one and the same, barring these following exceptions.</P>
<P>First his heats must be more moderate for fear of too much straining him, and the bettter to let him take pleasure therein.</P>
<P>Secondly, Omit the scouring, not giving him any more after his heats, lest his body by this time freed from the gross humours being too much opened by the operation of the purgation, contract cold and watery humours; but having moderately heated him, bring him home, cooling by gentle racking; and having caused him to empty himself, bring him into the Stable, tie him to the Rack, give him a Cordial ball about the bigness of a French Walnut, or Tennis ball, if he can swallow it. The receipt to make them is as followeth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To make Cordial balls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TAke Anniseed, Fenegreekseed, Car∣thumusseed, Cuminseed, Coltsfoot and Elecampane-roots, of each two ounces, bruised &amp; siersed: The husks and gross part being separated from the rest, add to them two ounces of Brimstone-flower, an ounce of the Juice of Liquorish put into half a pint of White-wine, then take an ounce of the
<PB N="71" REF="49"/> Chimical Oyl of Anniseed, Sugar, Syr∣rup and Salad Oyl, of each half a pint: these ingredients thus prepared, mix with them so much Wheat-flower as will mould them into a past, and make them up into balls as big as Walnuts, Hen-eggs or the like, and keep them in close earthen Pots for your use.</P>
<P>These balls are good to cure any violent Cold or Glaunders; to prevent sickness at heart caused by infection or ill digestion, to purge away all Molten grease, to recover a lost stomach, to keep the Horse from faint∣ing with exercise, and to fatten a lean Horse to admiration: And thus much as to the third fortnights dyet.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Rules to be observed in the fourth or last fort∣nights keeping, as well in relation to his Dyet as usage.</HEAD>
<P>IN this last Fortnight you must be more circumspect than in the former, and the first thing to be observed, is in ma∣king his bread a degree finer after this man∣ner.</P>
<P>To three pecks of fine Wheat well sifted put a peck of Beans cleared from the hulls, and grind them together, dressing the flow∣er through a Bolter as fine as possible, ma∣king it up with sweet Ale-yest or Barm,
<PB N="72" REF="50"/> and as much Ale as will wet it and make it plyable; then add the whites of twenty Eggs or thereabout, together with new milk, not putting any water into it, then knead it again, and having make it into reasonable big loaves, bake them well and cool them with the under-crust uppermost.</P>
<P>These loaves baked and cooled, after three days cut off the Crust, and with Oats well dryed and rubbed between your hands, being also winnowed and sifted, and a quan∣tity of the best spelt Beans; bait your Horse, cutting the bread, and observing the quantities of each as in the foregoing fort∣nights.</P>
<P>In the first week of this fortnight, you shall observe the heating days as before, but in the last week you must bate one heat, not permitting him to take any heat for the space of five days before the match is to be run, yet may you give him considerable Airings to keep up his wind, observing that you do not by any means give him a scou∣ring, but the better to expel the fumes or vapours that may offend him, burn in the Stable Storax, Albanum or Frankincense upon a Chafing-dish of Charcoal or small coal, in the scent of which he will take great delight. If at any time in this fort∣night you design to moisten his meat as it
<PB N="73" REF="50"/> is every five or six givings convenient, then let it be done with Muscadel, in which the whites of Eggs have been beaten, and it will the better hearten him to per∣form his course; as for Hay give him none, unless a small quantity after his heatings, which you must give him out of your hand, let it be well dusted and exceeding good.</P>
<P>The second week of the last fortnight, unless your Horse be a very foul feeder, you need not use the Muzzel till three days before the Match is to be run, but if he be a foul feeder and covet to eat his Lit∣ter, bite the Rack-staves, or the like, then put it on the beginning of the week and let it continue on at convenient times till the time he is to run.</P>
<P>Observe to feed your Horse well, both before and after Airing; the morning be∣fore the day you design to run for the wager, let his waterings be as formerly; but as for his meat let it be scantied a fourth part, both before noon and after.</P>
<P>Before your Evening Airings, and after be sure to feed as at noon, but be sure stay not abroad till Sunset.</P>
<P>Let him be this day, being the day be∣fore the Match, well shod, cooled, and all other things requisite, that on the day he is
<PB N="74" REF="51"/> to run, nothing may be left to do, thereby to trouble or disturb him, though some hold that the Horse being dressed and shod with light shoos will be so sensible of what he is to perform the next day, that for pride he will neither eat nor sleep; but this understanding can only remain in an old Horse-Racing Horse, who has been often used to the sport, and not in any other; therefore in that case 'tis my opinion the offices are better deferred till the morning of the day he is to run; but if otherwise, let them be done over-night, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>The breading of the Tail, by many is held both an ornament and a help to the Horse in his running, though according to the opinions of the most inquisitive into that affair, it rather hinders than furthers his speed, by reason that in straining the twists, drawing the roots of the hairs, put him to pain, and create an unusual heaviness, which makes him suppose that a weight or something else is fastned to his tail, there∣fore unless it be exceeding long and large it would do better to hang loose.</P>
<P>On the morning of the day, your match is to be performed, come to your Horse pretty betimes, and having taken off his Muzzel, rub his head well, as likewise his
<PB N="75" REF="51"/> Neck, Shoulders and Legs; then take a quantity of Oats, Mash them in Musca∣del, and give them to him to eat, the which if he refuse, then moisten another quantity with Whites of Eggs, but if those will not go down with him, then give him Oats well dryed and sifted, mixed with a small quantity of Wheat, or a shiving or two of your finest Bread well crumbled with them; but no Beans, let the quantity be very small, lest it hinder his running. If he be an evil emptier, then lead him to such places as he usually empties at, and provoke him thereto: but if he is not subject long to contain his food, but will empty freely, then you need not move him out of the Stable to empty, but there expect notice when to bring him forth to the Match.</P>
<P>When you receive the warning, wash his Snaffle in Muscadel, and having taken away the Muzzel, put it on: if you perceive any wind to move in your Horses belly, by reason of his emptiness, give him four or five mouth∣fuls of the meat last spoken of; and then pitch∣ing your Saddle and Girths with shoomakers wax, put it upon his back, gently girding it on that he may scarcely feel it, or at least, not so as in any wise to straiten him: over his Sad∣dle put a white Linnen cloth; upon that his ordinary cloaths; and over all, the better
<PB N="76" REF="52"/> to set him, and make him proud of him∣self, you may lay a Counterpain or piece of Arras: and so giving him a dose of Mus∣cadel, in a small drenching horn, proceed to the place intended for starting.</P>
<P>In the way permit him to smell to any Horse dung, new or old, to provoke him the better to empty, which will be a great advantage to him in his running: If he re∣fuse to empty, then lead him amongst Rushes, Brakes or Sedge, and thereby whist∣ling provoke him to it: but if that prevail not, then take out some of the wisps he is trussed with, and break them under him.</P>
<P>If in your leading him, any foam or froth arise in his mouth or elsewhere, wipe it away with a clean Linnen-cloth, and wash it with dipping it in water, which you shall carry with you for that purpose.</P>
<P>If you are to ride with any person, who by reason of his being lighter than your self, or that gives you any advantage, so that there are weights in the case to make both equal, or otherwise, as the agree∣ment is, then observe that he carries not those weights in his Saddle, but some∣where about himself, for if he carry them in the Saddle, they will neither hinder him nor prejudice the Horse, but be as if he did
<PB N="77" REF="52"/> carry none, and then you had as good ride with him on equal terms: but if your agree∣ment be that he shall carry them about him, then is the advantage much on your side.</P>
<P>As to the ground you must likewise have special regard, which you must take from your heats and breathings, that is, take no∣tice whether your Horse affects high or low ground, hard or soft, and if you can possibly without any signal disadvantage, keep him to such ground in his course.</P>
<P>These things consider, and all things brought to a point; when you are arri∣ved at the starting Post, uncloath your Horse, rub well his legs with wisps, cleanse his feet, and spirt cool water into his mouth, then mount your rider.</P>
<Q><L>Then starting fair, force on without controle,</L>
<L>And if your Horse be good, ne'r doubt the Goal.</L></Q>

<HEAD>Things to be observed in running Horses, as to the state of their bodies, in relation to sickness and health.</HEAD>
<P>REader I have already given you directi∣ons, how to order your Horse for a Match; I shall now lay down Rules and Methods, whereby you may keep him in
<PB N="78" REF="53"/> health, and fit for your purpose at all times, by such demonstrative tokens, as you may be continually sensible of the state of his body, drawn from the observations follow∣ing.</P>
<P>When you come to take a view of your Horse, narrowly inspect him, and if you perceive him heavy and dull of counte∣nance, Loose, Costive, Short-breath, Loa∣thing of meat; his Eyes glazed or dim, his Hair staring, his Hair strangely disco¦loured, if he stagger in his pace, be trou∣bled with ratling or short Cough, Dizzi∣ness in his head, Yellow under his upper Lip or in his eyes. If he be troubled with cold sweats, often lying down, and rest∣less when he is down, often looking on his body, alteration in his carriage and going; not casting his Coat in due sea∣son, or being hidebound. If I say, you per∣ceive any of these symptoms in your Horse, then is it your care to inquire from what cause it arises, and apply the cures which for the distempers before men∣tioned, I shall hereafter prescribe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="79" REF="53"/>
<HEAD>How to know the State of a Horses body by his Dung.</HEAD>
<P>I If your Horse dung be crisp, neither too hard nor too soft, of a pale colour, smell strong, something savouring of the ordure of a man, sound and in good health, then it is a sign your Horse is lusty and in health, clean and well fed.</P>
<P>If it be well coloured, yet if it fall from the Horse in round hard balls, as near as may be of a bigness, then it denotes your Horse evilly fed, having too much Hay, too little Corn, and permitted to feed too much upon his Litter.</P>
<P>If it fall in round knops, hard, and of colour black, or brown, it denotes excess of heat in the body of your Horse; if it appear greasie, it denotes foulness, and that in him remains Molten grease, that cannot find a passage out: If with his Dung he voids grease, that is white and clear, then it de∣notes that the Molten, and foul grease will kindly come away; but if you perceive it putrified or corrupted, which you may by its yellowness, then it betokens by rea∣son of the length of its continuance in the Horses body, corruption and putrefaction,
<PB N="80" REF="54"/> the which if it be not timely removed by scourings, will cause dangerous distempers. If his Dung appear red and hard, then it betokens that the Horse has been too much put to it in his Heats, and Coursing, and if he be not kept warm and well dyeted, Costiveness will follow. If his Dung be pale and loose, it betokens cold, occa∣sioned by moist feeding.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to know the State of your Horses body by his Ʋrine.</HEAD>
<P>IF his Urine be of a palish yellow thick, and smell strong and sharp, then is the Horse in health. If the Urine be of ruddy complexion tending somewhat to a thick blood colour, then it denotes the Horse to have been injured with excessive riding, or too early ridden after his being taken up from Winter Grass. If it prove of a high colour, clear and as it were sparkling, then it denotes an inflammation, or extraordi∣nary heat in the body, occasioned by sur∣feit.</P>
<P>If the Urine after it has stood a while ap∣pear to have a white Cream, or Scum upon it, then it denotes the Horse weak in the Loyns, and that his Seed is in Consump∣tion. Urine with bloody specks, or streaks
<PB N="81" REF="54"/> denotes an ulcer or some corroding distem∣per in the Kidnies.</P>
<P>If the Urine be black thick and of a cloudy or dusky hew, then it donotes great sickness, if not death to the Horse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to know the State of your Horses body by his feeding; and of Lameness.</HEAD>
<P>IF you perceive your Horse to refuse his meat, and seem to loath that meat he formerly loved: when you are sensible he by course must be hungry, it is a sign of heart sickness, occasioned by cold distillations, or foulness of stomach, occasioned by surfeit, got by over heating, which you must remove by gentle purgations, many of which I shall hereafter insert, and to bring him again to his stomach, you must use him gently, not forcing it upon him, but giving it him by degrees, as he pleases; and to whet his appetite, spirt Verjuce into his mouth, and hang up by him a Spunge dipped in them, or for want thereof dip a crust of bread in Vi∣negar, and tye it up in a cloth, where he may smell to it, and when his stomach comes to him, mingle fine and course dyet together, till he be brought to eat the latter alone as occasion serveth.</P>
<PB N="82" REF="55"/>
<P>If your Horse by standing too long idle, or therwise become Lame, or Restif, then the best way to recover him is to heat him well upon a smooth Down, or in a plain and soft field.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What is to be observed from the state of your Horses body.</HEAD>
<P>IN the outward appearance of a Horse, there is nothing more common than for some men to be deceived: Therefore it will not be amiss, if I lay down some rules worthy of observation.</P>
<P>First, then there are some Horses round, plump, and to appearance fat and well fleshed, when they are nothing so, the cause of which delusion arises from their being short from Head to Tail; well set, large buttock∣ed, well shouldered, and full sided.</P>
<P>Secondly, there are some Horses that al∣though they be in good case, yet they will to the eye appear lean, and their Ribs ap∣pear bare, nay when they are fat, foul, and full of grease and gross humours; and there∣by many skilful Jockies have been deceiv∣ed, as likewise Farriers, who supposing them to be in good case, have neglected to apply those remedies which were needfull, till
<PB N="83" REF="55"/> such time as the humours have ingendered divers diseases.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Many Horses will appear to be fat and foggy, by the outside, when inward∣ly they are clean and in good order, and so on the contrary, a Horse that appears lean will often be gross and foul within, as is said. Now to Remedy this oversight, handle your Horse diligently on the Ribs, and more particularly on his hindmost short-ribs, and observe well that if the flesh feel loose and soft, that your fingers dent in without much stress, then conclude your Horse to be foul; if it prove firm and hard on all other places, the hinder Rib excepted, then is he more foul and full of Molten grease, and evil humours, which must be voided by scouring and exercise, the latter to dissolve it, and the former to bring it away, though the Horse to the eye appear poor and ill favoured.</P>
<P>If you upon search find your Horse to be fat, thick, and to feeling, as it were, close between the Chaps, or his Jaws appear to be over fleshy, bearing out, it denotes much foulness, in both head and bo∣dy; but if he be thin, clean, and here and there lumps or kernels are to be felt within his chaps, it only denotes cold newly
<PB N="84" REF="56"/> taken, by being over-heated, standing in the rain, or in a damp Stable.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to know the State of your Horses body, from the privy parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF you observe your Horses stones to hang lank, and find the sinews to be limber, or hanging long from the body, then your Horse is not in good temper, but altogether out of order, occasioned by grease, or other foul humours, but on the contrary, if they be close knit and drawn near to his body, even round, and well couched, then he is in good and per∣fect health.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>From his Limbs, Observations to be taken.</HEAD>
<P>IF after a heat or the like, you find your Horses Limbs weak or stiff, it is a sign that he is tender in his joynts: to remedy which, anoint them with Dogs grease, Hogs grease, or Trotter Oyl, making it as hot as can be well indured, chafing it in with your hand, and although you anoint the joynts but once, yet after it, rub and supple them with your hands divers times, and so shall you bring them not only to be plyable, but prevent stifness for the future.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="85" REF="56"/>
<HEAD>In Watering, Observations to be taken.</HEAD>
<P>IF your Horse be in his feeding Fort∣nights for Racing, give him the first fortnight after Breathings or Heatings no water; the other three fortnights, you may give it him luke-warm, about six in the Morning, and six in the evening, but no great quantity, always observing to let him fast about an hour after it, and if you per∣ceive the weather to be rainy, flabby or cold, then your best way is to water him in the House, putting a third part of hot water to two parts of cold; into which as you see occasion you may throw wheat-flour or fine wheat-bran or Oatmeal, fine and well sifted from the husks.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>From your Horses Sweat, Observations to be taken.</HEAD>
<P>IF you perceive your Horse to sweat with little or no motion, then is your Horse filled with gross humours, fat and foul; but if he sweat with extraordinary motion, as heats or the like, then observe his sweat; if it be white, and frothy like a Ladder of Sope, then is he internally foul; but if the
<PB N="86" REF="57"/> sweat stand in watery Pearls, or trickle off like drops of Rain, then is your Horse in health, and a good State of body.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>From your Horses Hair, Observations to be taken.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Hair of your Horse neck and fore∣head be smooth and slick, not any ways staring, distorted or discoloured, then is your Horse in good health; but if staring, rough and distorted, shaggy or disordered, after an unusual manner, then conclude him to be distempered, either by a Surfeit, Looseness or extraordinary cold, and thus far having proceeded, as to the feeding, and State of a Horses body: I shall now pass on to instruct my Reader, how to know a good Horse in all his capacities, and not to be decei∣ved in buying, either by Jocky or any o∣ther pretending to Craft or Subtilty in that affair, to which for the better instruction and Caution of the unskilfull, I shall add the many Artifices, and Cheats of the Jockies, and other dealers in Horse-flesh, as also, how to avoid being cheated, or drawn in by such wiles, as many use to trapan or bubble the ignorant with.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="87" REF="57"/>
<HEAD>Advice to the Buyer, or certain and unerring Rules, whereby to understand the perfections and imperfections of any Horse, in a short time, if not upon the first sight.</HEAD>
<P>'TIs certain there is no greater cheat than buying of Horse-flesh; then to avoid the deceit, it is not amiss if you observe these following Rules, the which if you do, you may not only secure your self, but as occasi∣on offers, deceive the deceiver.</P>
<P>First, Consider to what end you buy, or to what use you design your Horse, whe∣ther for War, Hunting, Racing, Draw∣ing, or any other use, for to these ends serve different Horses according to Proportion, Strength or Beauty; therefore if you pur∣chase, in these cases, the lineaments and pro∣portion of the Horse must above all be taken notice of; as likewise inquiry be made into his Breed, a strict survey of his colour, and a more narrow inspection than ordinary into his paces or going, with many more, which in their order I shall lay down; but first, of the three I have mentioned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="88" REF="58"/>
<HEAD>What is to be observed as to the Breed.</HEAD>
<P>IF you desire a sound serviceable Horse, you must have great regard to the Breed, for if he be to appearance never so fair, and well shaped; yet if he was got∣ten by an old or infirm Stallion, or brought forth by a Mare subject to any in∣firmitie, or disease, for certain it is that such a Horse, promise he never so well, will be frequently subject to divers the like distempers. Another thing worthy of observation, is what Countrey breed the stock descended from, the which by these tokens you may guess at. The <HI>Nea∣politan</HI> breed is known by a bending or Hawks nose. The <HI>Spanish</HI> breed by dry, small, neat Limbs. The <HI>Barbary</HI> breed by his fine small head, well carried, and well set on, as also his deep hoof. The <HI>Dutch</HI> breed by the roughness of the legs. And the <HI>English</HI> breed by their being strong set, well knit, large Neck, wide and open Nostrils, and Brawny Thighs: And so of the breed of divers other Countries.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="89" REF="58"/>
<HEAD>Observation of Colours.</HEAD>
<P>CErtain it is there are good Horses of all Colours, though I must confess some Colours are better than othersome, both for beauty and the disposition of the Horse; and of these in their order. For beauty the Daple-gray is accounted the best; for ex∣traordinary service, most approve of the Bay-Horse, as also of the Brown. The Black, with some Silver hairs, for swift∣ness and courage, especially, if he have one white-foot, or a blazing-star in his fore∣head. As for the Sorrel; the Black with∣out any white about him, and the unchangea∣ble Iron-gray, they are accounted Cholerick. The Bright-bay, the Fleabitten, and the Black with white marks are of a San∣guin constitution. The Black, Pybald, White, Kite-colour, Yellow or Dun are of a Phlegmatick constitution. The Ches∣nut, Mouse-dun, Red-bay, and Blewish-gray are Melancholy. And thus I have deciphered the particular colours; of which in the Series of this Treatise I shall have further occasion to speak.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="90" REF="59"/>
<HEAD>Observation to be taken from Pacing, Trotting or the like.</HEAD>
<P>THe greatest ornament, both for plea∣sure and profit, as to your own ease and health, as likewise to your Horse's, is his going, which the buyer above all things must have a special regard to, es∣peially in these times, for such are the cheats of the Jockies, and other dealers in Horse flesh; that therein they will deceive the most curious, but as to particularize their divers Artifices and inventions to impose upon the unskilfull, I shall defer it till I come to expose their cheats, which in the end of this Treatise I intend to do.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What motion in your Horse is to be observed, upon divers occasions.</HEAD>
<P>THe Paces incident and most conveni∣ent for any Horse, is either Rack, Am∣ble, Trot or Gallop and to divers ends they serve: if you design your Horse for the Wars, then a lofty Trot or Prancing is best, as likewise if he be designed for Running or Hunting, and whether he be well addicted to this motion upon all oc∣casions, you shall perceive by his cross
<PB N="91" REF="59"/> moving his Limbs, as when the near hin∣derleg, and far foreleg move together at one and the same instant, and in this mo∣tion the nearer your Horse takes his Limbs from the ground; the opener, evener and shorter is his tread or pace: but if he take them up uneasie or slovenly, after a shuf∣fling manner as it were, then it denotes stumbling, lameness or some such like im∣perfection. If your Horse tread narrow, or cross, it signifies he is subject to inter∣fering and can never tread sure; if he takes his step askew or uneven, it signifies he is given to tire and faint, and will never per∣form any long journey or hard service. If he tread long, that denotes him subject to strains, sprains and over-reaches: but as to the other motions, in particular.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Ambling.</HEAD>
<P>IF for ease and pleasure you chuse your Horse, then the motion he can be sub∣ject to, is the Amble, which is opposite to Trotting. As thus, both the feet on one side must have equal motion, that is, the far foreleg, and the far hinderleg, which must move just even, large, smooth and withall swift; for if your Horse-tread a∣wry or false, it takes away the easiness of
<PB N="92" REF="60"/> his pace; and if he treads short, he rids no more ground than if he went a round foot pace; if he treads rough, it denotes roul∣ing in a shuffling manner, and is a false pace, which by some unskilfull man∣nager has been taught him, and so it is that he will soon fall out of into a Trot, or in a short time forget it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Racking.</HEAD>
<P>RAcking is a convenient and necessary pace for Buck-hunting, Riding-post or the like, being between a pace and Full-gallop, by some called the running speed, yet little differs from Ambling, on∣ly is more swift, and of a shorter tread, though the ground is better ridded in Am∣bling, yet this pace is more easie, and by some highly approved; but for it, there is no certain rule, it being a motion natu∣ral to most Horses that are brought to the Amble.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Gallop.</HEAD>
<P>THe Gallop is a motion exceeding ne∣cessary, and is most appropriated to Trotting Horses, because that fal∣ling
<PB N="93" REF="60"/> out of their Trot, they have no other pace but the Gallop, as likewise a Horse well used to Racking, will naturally take this motion: but the Pacer above all is the most awkard to be brought to it, though in a while with good usage and gentle in∣structions he will take it exceeding well: the cause why at first he is averse to this mo∣tion, is, for that he having been trained to a set pace; when he is forced to a swifter motion somewhat of the like nature, he by straining to swiften his pace, scambles with his legs, but when he understands the alteration, which he will after a months usage, he will be prone enough to take it upon all occasions; yet too much Gallop∣ping will prove prejudicial to his Pacing, and render it more hard by reason of strain∣ing; therefore, in my opinion it would be best for them that can afford it, to keep a Horse for every motion. In Gallopping especially, these things are to be observed, that from the ground he raises his feet nimbly, but not too high. That he neither rouleth nor beateth himself; but that stretching out his forelegs, his hinderlegs keep time cleaverly and swiftly, that he neither cutteth under his knee, neither cros∣seth nor strikes one foot against another, but with his far sore-foot still leadeth. If he
<PB N="94" REF="61"/> have these vertues, he is a true thorough∣paced Gallopper. If your Horse Gallop short and round, raising his forefeet, it de∣notes him strong, but not swift, and is most fit for the Wars. If he Gallop slow and sure, then appropriate him to Travail; but if you perceive he handles his feet confused, and seems to Gallop painfully, it denotes his sinews shrunk, and he will never prove a Gallopper, but will be subject to lameness: and thus much shall suffice as to the motions of Horses.</P>

<HEAD>Rules to be observed, in the Stature of a Horse; Marks whereby to know his goodness.</HEAD>
<P>THe Buyer in the Stature of a Horse must consider his ability, according to the imployment or use he designs him; the biggest and strongest are fit for laborious im∣ployments, as Drawing, carrying of burthens, double carriage, and the like. The Horses of a middle Stature are fittest for the Saddle of pleasure, and the smaller for such uses as they are capable to serve to. As for the Marks to be observed by the buyer, either of goodness or badness, they are many, and so numerous are the defects in Horses, that they cannot without great curiosity and narrow observance be deciphered. There∣fore
<PB N="95" REF="61"/> I shall lay down divers general Rules, the which being well observed will pre∣vent many deceits.</P>
<P>First, Then if you design to purchase, after you have satisfied your self in his breed, colour, stature, and motion, by the Rules aforesaid. Then his Saddle and cloaths being off, stand just before him, take a strict view of his Countenance, and the chearfulness of his Face, for according to the chearfulness or dullness thereof is your Horse to be va∣lued, the one presaging his goodness, and the other his badness.</P>
<P>Secondly, Observe his Ears, if they be sharp, thin, pricked and small, always standing or moving, or if they be somewhat long, well set on, well carried, and no ways lolling, then is it a mark of beauty, com∣liness and goodness; but on the contrary, signs of dullness, indisposition, and of a surly temper.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If his face be lean, his forehead bearing or swelling outward; the Mark or Feather in his Face set high above his eyes, or set on the top of his eyes; if he have a Star of white in his forehead, or a white streak, a snip of white on his nose or lip, it denotes goodness in the Horse. But if his face be dull, heavy, cloudy, his forehead flat, and his head big and fat, and have none of the
<PB N="96" REF="62"/> beforesaid marks of goodness, then he is nought; and although he have those marks, yet if his Star or streak stand awry, and where the snip is, or should be; his nose be bald or the like, then is he notwithstand∣ing of an evil Breed and defective.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Observe that his eyes are large, round, black, sparkling, and that the black of the eye fills the pit of the outward circum∣ference, so that little white is visible, then it betokens beauty and goodness; but if his eyes are uneven, look askew, wrinkled or small, dull, heavy and not quick moving, it signifies not only defect as to the un∣comeliness; but also a distempered and imperfect Horse, of an evil breed. If his eyes be Red, Fiery, take heed of Moon-eyes, which are not much distant from blindness, if for the greatest part White or Wall-ey'd, then it signifies weakness in the Horse, a weak sight, and subject to start at every object that swiftly is presented to his view. If you perceive white specks in the eyes, then it denoteth that he is in danger of having the Pin and Web, Pearl or the like infirmity, tending to blindness; if watery and bloody, then subject to hot Rheumes: if mattery, it is occasioned through excessive riding, surfeit, festered Rheumes or strains. If his eyes appear dead, dull
<PB N="97" REF="62"/> or hollow, sunk as it were in his head, then is he inclining to blindness, and will not long continue his perfect sight; or is got∣ten by an old Stallion on an old Mare. If his eyes are most white, and the black but small, so that the white appears much in sight as the balls move, it denotes weakness and an evil temper.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Observe his Chaps or Cheeks, and if you perceive the bones thin, lean, and between them a wide space. The Throple or wind-pipe big, no knots nor kernels near it, and the Jaws so great that the neck lyes as it were between them, it denotes the Horse to be sound and to have a good and long wind, as likewise to be of great courage; but on the contrary, if his Chaps or Cheeks be seeming fat or thick, the space between them closed with tu∣mid flesh; and the Wind-pipe small or in∣cumbred with kernels, then is the Horse short-winded, subject to the Strangles Glaunders, and divers other distempers. If his Jaws be strait, insomuch that his neck bears over, or swells above them, unless by some distemper occasioned, then it sig∣nifies foulness, pursiness, and that the Horse is subject to colds and surfeits. If the swelling be long, close, and feel hard, then will he be subject to the Winds or impo∣stume.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="63"/>
<P>Sixthly, Observe his Nostrils, the which if they prove wide, large, open and dry, so that upon any snorting or straining of the Horse, the inward redness appears, his Muzzel small, and he deep mouthed, his lips equally meeting; then is he a Horse of good wind, good mettal, and of a sound constitution: but if the contrary, then is he subject to divers distempers, and will ne∣ver prove a good Horse.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Observe his breast, the which if it be broad, swelling out hard, well boned, and the like, it denoteth strength, comeli∣ness and continuance: but on the contrary, if it be narrow or bending inwards, it de∣noteth the Horse to be apt to stumble, of a weak spirit, and altogether unfit for the performance of any great labour; as like∣wise much deformity.</P>
<P>Eighthly, Observe from his Elbow to his Knee, that his thighs be well brawned, clean and solidly fleshed: for if strong Li∣gaments are wanting, and the flesh feel soft and spungy, then it denotes weakness in your Horse, as the other doth strength.</P>
<P>Ninthly, Take especial notice of his knees, that they are of due proportion, not one higher than the other, well joyn∣ted, sinewed and strongly knit, lean, even, which betokens strength and comeliness;
<PB N="99" REF="63"/> when on the other hand, if they be Gross, Gouty, Scared, want Hair in some places, it denotes weakness, stumbling and a dis∣proportioned Jade.</P>
<P>Tenthly, Observe his legs; if they ap∣pear, upon handling, lean, rather flat than round, full of sinews, bending inward, without seams or hair broken: It denotes a sound substantial Horse, and one that will indure much labour. When marks, on the contrary, as fleshy legs distorted, bending outward or the like, denote a weak unserviceable and tyring Horse.</P>
<P>What has been before spoken of, being narrowly observed by the Buyer, let him also take particular notice of what as yet remains untouch'd; which in their order, for his better instructions, I shall set down.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Observations on the Pasterns.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you buy, or would know the well going of a Horse for many years, observe the Pastern joynt, and Pa∣stern. The first of which being clear and well knit together, and the last short, strong and upright, denotes a good firm and sub∣stantial tread, but if the former appear big or puffy, seeming somewhat swelled, then is the Horse subject to sinew Strains and
<PB N="100" REF="64"/> Gourdings, or if the latter be long, weakly knit, and bending in and out in the mo∣tion, it denotes a weak Horse, and one soon tired.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Observations on the Hoof.</HEAD>
<P>THe best Hoof is the black smooth and tough Hoof, rather inclining to long, than round and well hollowed, subject much to sounding. As for the white Hoof it is ten∣der, and will not well bear a shoo. The Hoof that is rugged and full of seams or wrinkles, denotes Old-Age in the Horse that he came of an old decayed stock, or has been addicted to over-heats. As for the brittle Hoof it is worst of all, for it will carry no shoo. If the Hoof be more than ordinary round, the Horse will be apt to trip and stumble, especially in deep ways; or if he be but put to an extraordinary mo∣tion. If the Hoof be flat and Pumiced, it denotes foundering. The Hoof that is hollow and empty, betokens the inward de∣cay, by reason of some founder bruise, or wound not throughly searched or cured. Take likewise notice of the Crown of the Hoof, and if you perceive the flesh flat, and the hair smooth, then is all in good order in that part; but if the Hair be rough, rising, the
<PB N="101" REF="64"/> flesh swelling, full of knops or scabs, scared or broken, then it denotes a Ring bone, Quitter-bone, or Crown-scab.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Things to be observed in the setting on of the Head, Crest and Maine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving viewed your Horse narrowly before, come to his right-side, and there take especial notice that his head be placed neither too high nor too low, but that it stand as it were in a direct line, evenly carryed, and for his Neck, let it be small at the setting on of the head, long, and still growing deeper, as it descends towards the should∣ers, with a high strong and thin Main, long, soft, and indifferently well curling, which denotes the Horse not only of a good breed, but are greatly ornamental; for if the Head be ill set on, though in it self it be well shaped, 'tis a great blemish to the beauty of the Horse. If you per∣ceive any rising or swelling in the nape of the neck, it is a symptom of the Pole-evil or a fistula. If your Horse have a short thick neck, or if it be fat and falling at the Withers; if the Crest be low, thick, falling, and weak, they are tokens of dullness in the Horse; as also does an extraordinary thick Maine: little hair on the Maine, denotes fury, but
<PB N="102" REF="65"/> if it fall off, then is it occasioned by the distemper called the Worm in the Maine; the Itch or Manginess, which there are breeding, though perhaps not apparent by any other symptoms.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What is to be observed in the Back-ribs, Fil∣lets, Belly and Stones.</HEAD>
<P>TAke special notice that the chine of the back be broad, strait and even; the Ribs strong, well composed, at equal distance, bending out Archwise. That his Fillets be upright, strong and short; and that the space between the last Rib and the Huckle-bone exceed not a handful. As for his Belly, let it fall down indifferently well, descend∣ing as it were by degrees, from his loyns to his foreparts; and his Stones carried even, and not hanging down, or swagging. All these denote perfection in a Horse; but if the Chine be narrow, he is nought for the Saddle, and if put to it, very much subject to gauling; to be Saddle-backed, Sway-backed, or have the back bending, denotes weakness. Flat Ribs betoken hide-boundness. Hanging long or weak Fillets, denote him not capable of clambering, or journeying in hilly Countries, nor of carrying
<PB N="103" REF="65"/> a burthen. If his belly be clung, or over gaunt, his Stones uneven or dangling, they are symptoms of sickness, foundering or dullness, and unaptness to labour.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Observations to be made on the Buttocks and Hinder thighs of your Horse.</HEAD>
<P>OBserve that the Buttocks be plump, round, level with the body; or if long, then take notice that they rise well behind, spreading decently at the setting on of the Tail, both which are marks of beauty; as on the contrary, a narrow Pin Buttock, Hog-rump, or falling down, are marks of deformity, neither fitsor to carry Pad, Foot-cloth or Pillion.</P>
<P>If the Thighs or Gaskings be even, and let down well, to the middle joynt, full of sinews, thick and brawny, they are signs of Beauty and strength, but if they appear Slender or Lank, it de∣notes deformity, and weakness in your Horse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="104" REF="66"/>
<HEAD>What is necessary to be observed in the hinder∣legs, Tail and Cambrels.</HEAD>
<P>LEt our buyer observe that the hinder legs be clean, lean, and full of strong sinews, somewhat inclining to fatness, for if they be fat, fleshy, and tumid, it de∣notes the Horse not capable of hard labour, and that the grease is Molten in them. If you perceive any scabs above the Pasterns, then it denoteth him to have the scratches, or if a chop appear there, then is he affli∣cted with the Rheumes.</P>
<P>As for the setting on the Tail, it is worthy only of this observation, that where there is a good Buttock, the Tail cannot be evil∣ly set on; and where there is a bad Buttock, it cannot stand right: A Tail well set on ought to stand broad, high, and flat, couch∣ing somewhat inwards.</P>
<P>The observations necessary to be made on the Cambrels of your Horse, are these; first, observe well the middle joynt behind, and if there you perceive it replenished with firm smooth skin-bones and sinews, a little bending, then is that part of the Horse sound and beautiful. Secondly, If in making a narrow inspection, you do per∣ceive
<PB N="105" REF="66"/> Sores, Chaps, inward bought or bending, then it denotes the Horse to be troubled with a Sellander: but if all o∣ver the joynt, you perceive it tumid or swelled, it is a sign he has received some blow or bruise; yet if it be a particular swelling in the hollow part, Pit, or proud &amp; full on the inside of the vein; and the swel∣ling be soft, then is it a Blood Spavin; or if hard, a bone Spavin: but if it appear be∣hind, before the Knuckle, then conclude it to be a Curb. And thus far having sup∣plyed the Buyer with infallible directions to prevent all frauds, if they be narrowly ob∣served, I shall proceed to lay down infallible Rules, whereby a Horses age may be known.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Infallible Rules, whereby to know the age of any Horse or Mare.</HEAD>
<P>THe first thing herein to be observed, is his Teeth, the which when the Horse has his full number, are 40 <HI>viz.</HI> six great Wang-teeth above, and 6 beneath, on either side making in all 24 and are properly called his Grinders: in the fore part of his mouth he hath 6 above, and the like number below al∣so called Gatherers, and 4 Tushes, two above and two below, which in all make 40. the latter 4 are called the Bitt-Teeth. Now
<PB N="106" REF="67"/> the observations whereby to know the Horses age, are these.</P>
<P>The first year his Foals or Colts teeth called Grinders or Gatherers only appear, and these are small white and smooth.</P>
<P>The second year he changeth two of his fore teeth, one above, and the other beneath, each in the middle of the Rows, of the Gatherers, which come up browner and larger than the other.</P>
<P>The year following, he changeth the next to those aforesaid, leaving no direct Colts-teeth before, unless on either side two above, and two below, which are small and bright.</P>
<P>The fourth year no Foals teeth, except one on either side are left him, he chang∣ing what otherwise remained.</P>
<P>The fifth year he changeth all his fore∣most teeth, having his Tushes compleat, and those that come up in the place of the last Foals teeth he casteth, will be hollow with small black specks in the midst of them, by the continuance of which the Horses age is to be known to the eighth year.</P>
<P>The sixth year his new Tushes put forth, at the bottom of which young flesh will appear, the Tushes small, white, sharp and short.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="67"/>
<P>The Seventh year his teeth will be all of perfect growth, and the Mark in the mouth more visible than ever.</P>
<P>On the Eighth year all his teeth will be plain, smooth, full and in their perfect shape, at what time the black specks will diminish, being not after the expiration of that year to be perceived, the Tushes will likewise change colour, becoming more yellow.</P>
<P>The Ninth year, the Mark being vanish∣ed, the fore teeth will be longer and broad∣er than usual, and change their colour to a yellowish paleness, his Tushes losing much of their sharpness.</P>
<P>The Tenth year, the holes in the inside of his upper Tushes will be filled up, which till that time you may with your finger feel like hollow pits, and the Temples of the head appear crooked, and begin to hol∣low.</P>
<P>The Eleventh year will produce his teeth of a great length, yellow, foul and distorted.</P>
<P>The Twelfth and last year to know a Hor∣ses age by his teeth, you will observe them long, exceeding yellow, and that the up∣per teeth will hang over the under ones, and though some are of opinion that his age to the thirteenth year is to be known, by the wearing of his Tushes close to his chaps,
<PB N="108" REF="68"/> and the blackness of them, yet according to the observations that have been made, this is no certain Rule, for so they frequent∣ly are the twelfth year.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Observations to know his age, by his Mouth.</HEAD>
<P>IF his lips and upper teeth over-hang, and seem unseemly, uneven, unless it be occasioned by a cold, surfeit, or extraordi∣nary riding, it denotes the Horse to be Old. Another thing in the mouth worthy of ob∣servation, is to observe whether he be not too deep burnt of the Lampus, and that the bars and flesh lie even and smooth; for if the hole be too deep burnt, Hay and Provender will stick therein, to his great hindrance in feeding.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Age to be known by the Hoof.</HEAD>
<P>A Rugged and seamed Hoof, crinkled and drawn as it were in heaps, de∣notes an old Horse, as also a crusty crumb∣ling Pumice Hoof; when on the contrary a smooth moist hollow and well sounding Hoof betokens a young Horse well in health, and condition for Travail.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="109" REF="68"/>
<HEAD>Age to be known by the Tail.</HEAD>
<P>IF you by feeling the Tail close to its setting on, perceive the joynt there to rise on either side, or stand out to the bigness of a Hazel-nut, or thereabouts, then it is a sign the Horse is young, not exceeding three years old, but if no such knop appear, but that all the joynts are plain, then he is above Ten, and may exceed Twelve or Thir∣teen.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Age to be known by the Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you take a view of your Hor∣ses Eyes, if you observe they be Round, Full, Staring, and standing out, and that the pits be full and even with the Temples, then it denotes the Horse to be young; but if the Eyes be Sunk, Dim, Hollow, Pitted, the Temples wrinkled or crooked, then it denotes old age.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Age to be known by the Skin.</HEAD>
<P>IF you would know whether your Horse is old or young by the skin, you must take it up between your thumb and finger, and suddainly letting it fall, observe whether it immediately returns smooth to
<PB N="110" REF="69"/> the place, which if it does, it denotes him young; but if not, but that it is long in falling, and wrinkled, then is he old.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Age to be known by the Hair.</HEAD>
<P>VIewing your Horse well, if you per∣ceive any grizly hairs growing about the Eybrows; the Horse being naturally of a dark colour, or that the like hairs grow un∣derneath the Main; or if your Horse is na∣turally white, and he become Mannelled with Black or Red Mannels in most parts of his body, then is he an Old Horse, and will not be long fit for service.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Age to be known by the Barrs.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Bars of your Horses Mouth feel hard and rough, and are great and deep, then be assured, the Horse is old; but if tender, shallow and soft, he is young. These directions well observed, will prevent all deceits, and render the buyer capable to lay out his mony to the best advantages, though indeed there are many Artificial cheats used by Jockies, that may deceive the most curious, of which amongst many other curious mysteries, I shall hereafter treat; and
<PB N="111" REF="69"/> now proceed to the office of the skillful Farrier.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Office of the Farrier, and what is chiefly therein to be considered.</HEAD>
<P>HE that will be accounted an experien∣ced able Farrier, must not only be skilled in shooing, and dressing, but in all the parts of a Horses body, thereby to know from whence proceeds the original cause of any distemper, how and by what means it was generated, and the more effectually to apply such remedies as may remove the distemper, and work a perfect cure: to do which, note these following considerations.</P>
<P>First, That the seat of life is in the Brain, Heart and Liver, from whence it operates in, and disposes every member; and for that end, those by many are called the three principal members, to which some would add a fourth, <HI>viz.</HI> the Stones, but that addition by the wisest practitioners has been rejected.</P>
<P>Secondly, The sinews which are these, two white sinews or Tendons, which be∣gin at the Nose, and passing through the neck and back, branch into the forelegs, and end in the hinderlegs, taking their liga∣ments in all the four feet. Two sinews
<PB N="112" REF="70"/> called the Main sinews, which descend from the Brain, and passing down the cheeks, fasten the Jaws. Three, from the Shoul∣der to the first joynt of the Arms, or fore∣legs, besides two other great sinews; four great sinews from the knees to the Pa∣sterns, with the same number in the hinder part above, as well within as without the forepart of the breast, are ten sinews great and small. From the Reins of the back to the Stones are four great sinews or Liga∣ments, and another great sinew which runs to the end of the Tail: To conclude, a Horse has great and small sinews 29. or as some will have it 30.</P>
<P>Thirdly, As to the Veins in a Horse, through which the blood circulates the whole body; they are many, yet seeing they all center in the Liver, the seat and fountain of blood, distributing it into every part: divers are of opinion that a Horse has properly but one vein, which is called the Median, and that when ever the blood is corrupted, or that vein is afflicted with wind or any infirmity, it dispensing it through all the branches, afflicts at once the whole body of the Horse. Those branches, that ascend to the head and upper parts of the body, are called ascendants, and those that run down into their legs and nether parts of
<PB N="113" REF="70"/> the body descendants, and through these branches, whether the beast sleep or wake, the blood continues its course, as indeed it does in all creatures, whose bulk admit a free passage, Ebbing and Flowing like the Ocean, by the course of the Moon. Now the things herein chiefly to be considered, are the Branches from whence upon sundry occasions, it is most proper to take blood; which indeed are many consistant to the di∣stemper: for the branch is to be opened, as it either affects the blood, or is seated in the body of the Horse.</P>
<P>But the Veins most convenient to be opened, are these, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Neck, in the weeping veins under the Ears, and about the head in six other places, as in the Pa∣late-veins in the Tongue, in the Flank-veins, in the breast, and Spur-veins, in the four members, <HI>viz.</HI> the Legs, Thighs, Pa∣sterns and Feet, and indeed in most veins, according as the distemper is seated, by bloodletting, being great, as in the follow∣ing chapter will appear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To what end Phlebotomy, or bloodletting serves.</HEAD>
<P>THe opening the Temple vein easeth pain in the head, caused by cold Rheumes, Feavers, Drowsiness, Stavars,
<PB N="114" REF="71"/> yellows, Frenzy, Sleepy-evil, Falling-evil or any grief afflicting the Eyes or Brain. The opening of the Weeping veins, is ex∣ceeding good to prevent blindness, and to cure the distempers in the eyes, as Water∣ings, hot Rheumes, Haws, Pin and Web, Pearls, blood-shotten and the like. The opening the Palate-veins, cures or pervents the Lampass, or inward sickness, as Sta∣vars, Anticor, Yellows, Drowsiness, Sur∣feits, Tirings, and many times cureth the Strangles, Quinsie, Swelling of the kernels, Pustles, Inflammation, or Glaunders, espe∣cially, if you cause him to drink the blood mixed with a little Bay-salt. The next veins opened help the Yellows, Farcins, Stavars, Mangies, Agues, Feavours, Surfeits, Scabs, Glaunders and the like; and often prevent sickness in your Horse or Mare. The opening the palate, or breast veins, prevent or help the Anticor, Moore-foundering, occasioned by molten grease, contracted in the body by hard riding, it likewise preventeth diseases in the Liver, Lungs and other internal parts, is conveni∣ent to be done upon any hurt or sprain in the Shoulder, to prevent Lameness. The opening the two thigh veins, helpeth foun∣dering in the forefeet, Splint, Screw-ring∣bone, Mallender, or the like infirmity.
<PB N="115" REF="71"/> To bleed the four Shackle veins before, is good against the Crown-scab, Quitter-bone and the like distemper incident to the feet of a Horse or Mare. To bleed the Spur-veins is excellent good for the Moore-founder, Farcine in the side, swelling under the belly or the like. The Toe-veins being opened do help Frettizing, foundering, Hoof-bound or any grief, occasioned by the Horses beating his Hoofs upon hard stony way: Bleeding the two thigh-veins behind, easeth the grief of the kidnies, swelling in the hinder legs, Foundering, Scratches, pissing of Blood, occasioned by overstraining, or the weakness of the Reins, Back or Belly, and infirmity in the Guts; as likewise the Curb, Spavin, and such other distempers or griefs, as proceed from rankness or impurity of Blood. To open the Shackle veins behind, is exceeding good to prevent foundering, or any pain the Horse is subject to have in his feet. To open the Flank-veins, is exceeding good in case of a Feavour, Swelling in the Stones, Poverty, or the Felt-worm. And lastly, to bleed the Tail-vein often, prevents the Mange, Scabs, Itch, and falling off of the Hair. So that the number of veins that are usu∣ally opened upon divers occasions are Thirty: the opening of which greatly con∣tribute
<PB N="116" REF="72"/> to the health of the Horse or Mare, not only by preventing distempers, as has been before said, but frequently without any other application, by taking away the effects, cause the grief to cease, or at least pre∣pare the body of the Horse, the better to receive such effectual medicines as will work his cure, and dispose outward wounds, bruises and the like, to such a temper that they heal without much difficulty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What seasons are best to let blood in.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Horse be in great danger, you need not expect the critical times, but let him blood presently; but if otherwise, ob∣serve these following days, <HI>viz.</HI> the third and fifteenth of <HI>January.</HI> The fourth and ninth of <HI>February.</HI> The seventeenth and eighteenth of <HI>March.</HI> The tenth and six∣teenth of <HI>April.</HI> The first and thirteenth of <HI>May</HI> The fifteenth and twentieth of <HI>June.</HI> In <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> forbear letting blood, unless upon some urgent occasion. In <HI>September</HI> bleed him on the eleventh and twenty-eighth day. In <HI>October,</HI> on the eight and twenty third. In <HI>November,</HI> on the fifth and sixteenth. In <HI>December,</HI> on the
<PB N="117" REF="72"/> fourteenth and twenty sixth, these days be∣ing by all the experienced Farriers holden the best for sundry regards, but especially in respect to the signs, which are these, and thus govern, <HI>viz. Aries</HI> the head, <HI>Taurus</HI> the neck, <HI>Gemini</HI> the shoulders, <HI>Cancer</HI> the stomach, <HI>Leo</HI> the heart, <HI>Virgo</HI> the guts, and belly, <HI>Libra</HI> the reins and buttocks, <HI>Scor∣pio</HI> the privities, <HI>Sagittarius</HI> the thighs, <HI>Ca∣pricorn</HI> the knees, <HI>Aquarius</HI> the legs, and <HI>Pisces</HI> the feet; from which note that it is not at all safe to let blood in that part, where the sign is predominant.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">

<HEAD>Of the four Humours, Sympathising with the four Humours incident to all Creatures.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not the least part of the Farriers Of∣fice, to consider and well understand the nature, and qualities of the four Ele∣mentary Humours, that go to the compo∣sition of all creatures. And first as the four Elements, <HI>viz.</HI> Fire, Air, Water and Earth, give life and Nutriment to all li∣ving creatures. So the four Humours, <HI>viz.</HI> Choler, Blood, Phlegm and Melancholy are the principal Agitators in the bodies of all Creatures, and as it were compose them, or at least preserve them; for without either no creature can subsist. Choler, by reason of its heat, being alluded to Fire; Blood, by reason of its heat and moisture to Air; Phlegm, by reason of its coldness and moi∣sture to Water; and Melancholy, by rea∣son of its cold and dryness, to Earth: as for Choler, its seat is in and near the Liver, which by reason of its heat and dryness accords with the blood, which has its foun∣tain in the Liver, and from thence disper∣ses it self throughout the whole body, nourishing and preserving it in all parts:
<PB N="119" REF="73"/> Phlegm has its chief seat in and about the Brain, that seat of life, altogether affecting Cold. Melancholy occupieth the Spleen, be∣ing the gross and excremental part of blood and choler, descending from the Liver. As for the Offices or dispositions of these humours, they are four, <HI>viz.</HI> Choler caus∣eth concoction, and voiding of Excrements. Blood nourishes the body. Phlegm gives motion to the joynts. And Melancholy disposeth to appetite, creating a good sto∣mach.</P>

<HEAD>How to know by the Colour of a Horse, to which of the four aforesaid Humors he is most in∣clinable, and how thereupon to order him for the prevention, or curing such distempers as he is most subject to.</HEAD>
<P>TO know the better to prepare your Medicines, necessary to be given up∣on sundry occasions; it is first necessary that you know which of the four aforesaid hu∣mours is most predominant in your Horse, which cannot better be discerned than by his Colour or complexion: note then if he be cole-black without any white, a bright Sor∣rel or an Iron-gray unchangeable, that will neither turn to a Flea-bitten, White, or Da∣ple gray, then is he most subject to Choler,
<PB N="120" REF="74"/> by reason of the great heat in him, often incident to inflammation of the Liver, Yel∣lows and Pestilential Feavours; and in that case you must, to prevent these distempers, give him medicines to purge Choler, but let them not be of a quality too much ope∣rating, lest they impair his strength to that degree, that he never after recover it: for all cholerick Horses, though they be fierce and fiery, are but of small strength. If your Horse be coloured either Bright-bay, or Dark-bay, neither scouling counte∣nance, maughy mouthed, or white flanked, or a white Fleabitten, white Lyard, like sil∣ver, or black with a white Star, white Rash, or white foot, then is he Sanguin; and the diseases to which he is most subject, are the Glaunders, Consumption of the Liver, Leprosie or such other distempers as are caused by infection. As for the Horses of a Snguin complection, they are for the most part of a strong constitution, and will in∣dure strong medicines, without impairing their strength, if the medicines be not com∣pounded of extraordinary hot ingredients, to over-heat the blood.</P>
<P>If your Horses colour be Milk-white, Py-bald, Yellow, Dun, Kite-colour, or any the like colours, in mixture, then is he Phlegmatick, being slow by nature, and apt
<PB N="121" REF="74"/> to lose his flesh, subject to cold Rheums, Head-ach, Cough, Staggers, and indeed all distempers proceeding from cold or watery distillations, and therefore must have hot medicines, that is, simples of a hot and strong working nature that may operate upon the Mass of Phlegm, which generates the distempers.</P>
<P>If your Horse be of a Dark-bay colour, having long white hairs like Goats hairs on his legs, Russet, Chesnut, Ash-colour∣ed, Gray or Mouse-dun, then does Melan∣choly abound in him, and the distempers he is most subject to, are the inflammation of the Spleen, Dropsie, Frenzy, and such like dull and Melancholy distempers; and therefore require cold and moist medicines, those of a dry or hot quality being altoge∣ther hurtful and unprofitable. Their strength is greater than it appears to be, and for the most part they are fit for servile labours, and thus much of the four Elementary humours: now there are di∣vers Horses mixed with all the aforesaid colours, or some three or four of them; in such a case, note that those Horses have those humours most predominant, of which their colour is mostly, according to what has been said, and so consequently ought the medicines to be prepared with regard
<PB N="122" REF="75"/> to the nature of the sickness for; if it has continued long, and the Horse be infee∣bled thereby, then you must not give him over strong potions, but if he be young and lusty, not having languished under the force of the distemper; then any well composed sutable medicine will not be amiss, but as to medicines in particular I shall speak at large hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>Things to be observed, to keep a Horse in health, and make him long continue so.</HEAD>
<P>IF you would have your Horse continue in health and live long, twelve things are to be observed. 1. Let him moderate∣ly feed. 2. See that he have good nourishment and be of a quick and clean digesture. 3. Let him labour moderately. 4. If he be not too much subject to sleep. 5. If he be not permitted often to leap Mares, 6. That in all journeys moderation be used, not Travailing too far without resting, or baiting. 7. That he be kept in wholsome Air. 8. Not to exercise him too soon af∣ter Grass. 9. That he be kept from raw green meats. 10. Not to suffer him to eat or drink after exercise, or a journey, be∣fore he is throughly col'd. 12. With his Provender give him wholsome simples,
<PB N="123" REF="75"/> for the most part dry, the nature of which being such as is good against such distem∣pers as your Horse by his complexion may be or is inclinable to, as Anniseeds, Fennel∣seed, Fennegreek, Bay-berries, Brimstone, Alum, Hempseed, Elecampain, or the Roots of Polipodium of the Oke, Savin, Rue, Hyssop, Colts foot, Hore-hound, Marsh-mallows and the like; if you have them not dry, you may by chopping them small give him them green; but if dry, for so they are best, crush them to pow∣der and sprinkle them amongst his Oats, or Beans, or amongst Hay cut short, and they so taken will prevent obstructions by purifying the blood, thereby rendering the whole body in sound and perfect health.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Sickness, Dangerous to Horses; and its O∣riginal.</HEAD>
<P>THe main cause of most Internal di∣stempers in Horses proceeds either from over violent heats in exercise, as when the Horse hath his grease molten, or the heart over charged with vitiated blood, so that the Pores or passages are so stopped, that the Vital spirits dis∣persed throughout the body, cannot re∣turn turn to their center, nor the heart be
<PB N="124" REF="76"/> exhilerated for want of an intercourse with the Liver. These obstructions, I say, ex∣cluding the Vital Spirits, the Organs of the body cannot rejoyce, which occasions mor∣tal sickness.</P>
<P>Another cause there is, which proceedeth from cold occasioned through the negli∣gence of the keeper, in not regarding him before and after a journey or exercise, as he ought; which once taken, troubles his head with pains and dullness, making him look heavy and dull eyed; the root of the Tongue being often inflamed and swel∣led. The Lungs tickled, and offended with Rheums, causing strong and tedious Coughs, which greatly indispose and offend him, whiles noisome filth proceeds from his nostrils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A third cause there is cometh by un∣seasonable eating or over eating, which frequently begets a surfeit, especially if he eat unwholsome food. If he eat to excess, it many times proves mortal, by reason it creates unwholesome vapours, noisome fumes and the like, which ascending from the stomach to the brain, poyson and infect it, or if the Horse escape with life, yet seldom misses to have Stavers, or Frenzy: if the food he has eaten be unwholsome, raw or out of season, then it breeds diseases by producing
<PB N="125" REF="76"/> corrupt vitiated blood or infectious wa∣tery humours, from which proceed the Yellows, Farcines, Feavers, Manginess and the like, which infecting the heart, stopping the free passage of the stomach, and dispersing throughout the body, leaves no member free from affliction.</P>
<P>A fourth cause there is, which we may call accidental, which is when a Horse taketh in poyson with his food, or receiveth a wound, or extraordinary bruise, which inflames the blood, and makes each part become hot and feaverish, the which by degrees turns to many evil distempers that end but with the life of the Horse; there∣fore on this occasion, there is nothing more necessary than to apply pertinent medi∣cines in time, ere the malady has taken root.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to discern by divers symptoms any mortal sickness in a Horse.</HEAD>
<P>HAving laid down the original causes of most mortal sicknesses, I shall now proceed to let you understand how they may be known by the sundry symp∣toms that forerun, or attend them according to the opinion of the most expert pra∣ctitioners in this Art. If the sickness be
<PB N="126" REF="77"/> occasioned through immoderate heats or journeying, then it is signified by the heavy∣ness of his countenance, swelling of his legs and other limbs, but his hinder legs especially by the loosness and scouring of his body, at the beginning of the sickness, short and hot breath, and a loathing or for∣saking his meat. If the sickness proceeds from cold, then it is known by a down∣cast Countenance, Drowsiness, and desire of sleep; Pustils or hard knots under the Caul; and many times by the in∣flammations of the Kernels, and swellings as high as the roots of the Ears, attended by a moist and inward sounding cough, and the like.</P>
<P>If the sickness be occasioned by a surfeit taken after the manner aforesaid, then the signs or symptoms are violent pains in the head, so that he will not by reason of the dullness it occasions, be able to hold it up to the Rack: His Eyes will like∣wise appear dull and sunk in his Head, his Ears pricked up, and the tops of them cold; as also his upperlip and sheath; Reeling and Staggering as he goes, the which if it be delayed will turn to Mad∣ness, and that Madness be known by his eager biting the Manger, or Rackstaves, and often beating his head against the
<PB N="127" REF="77"/> Wall; you may likewise know whether the distemper has tainted the Brain, by the yellowness of his Eyes, Lips, and Tongue.</P>
<P>The symptoms to know accidental sick∣ness occasioned by wounds and the like, are unusual Sweats, tremblings, a sweat or Froth at roots of his Ears, upon the Flanks behind, the Shoulders, and against the Heart, at other∣times glowing and burning in the Tem∣ples, against the Heart, and inside of the fore∣legs, and of the hinderlegs, dry and hot in the Mouth, inflammation in the Tongue, a loathing of meat, and desire of cold wa∣ter, in which after he hath drunk his fill, he will be desirous to hold his mouth.</P>
<P>Now to prevent any of these sickness, if you find him a little distempered, or any thing inclining to be out of order, let him blood, and for three mornings successive∣ly give him a Diapente-drink, and keep∣ing him warm, let him fast for three hours after, then give him a Mash of Beans, Bran and Oats, and a little knop of Hay, but if it so happen that you are unprovided with Diapente, which no Farrier ought to be, then take a handful of Celendine, wash it well, roots and leaves, adding to it Wormwoord and Rue, half a handful of
<PB N="128" REF="78"/> both, boil them in a pottle of ALE or Beer, till they come to the quantity of a quart, to which well strained put half a pound of sweet-butter, and two ounces of Treacle, which ingredients well mixed, give him blood warm.</P>
<P>If you would fortifie your Horse a∣gainst any distemper, then observe all the twelve rules before laid down, relating to health and long life or continuance, and moreover, if you intend to put him to Grass, after he hath long stood in the House, then having let him blood every day, abate of his cloaths, till you have brought him to none, thereby to render him hardy, and able to indure cold, but be sure you put him not into wet Pasture, where damp and noisome Air arise from Ditches, Rivers, Fens or Quagmires; and before you turn him out of the Stable, for three mornings successively give him drink made as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>How to order your Horse, upon taking him up from Grass, to prevent sickness.</HEAD>
<P>OBserve when you take up your Horse, that he be throughly dry, not damp, either by rain, cold dews or sweat, and let him not stay abroad longer than St. <HI>Bartholomews</HI> day, unless the weather is exceeding clear and warm, and if so, you may suffer him to run the first of <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI> but not longer, for after that cold dews fall, raw damps arise, and the heart of the Grass faileth, if you through neg∣lect take him up wet, it will subject him to manginess, and if you suffer him to continue abroad longer than the times speci∣fied, the grass instead of nutriment will breed could Phlegmatick humours and putrefi∣ed blood; and for a week or more after he is taken up, give him no immoderate heats, nor Travail, lest thereby you melt the grease within him, his fat gotten at grass
<PB N="130" REF="79"/> being so tender, that the least extraordinary motion dissolveth it, whereby if the blood happen to be inflamed, it will indanger his falling into a mortal sickness, which happening, often ends in Death; when you have him in the stable, let him blood upon the next blooding day, according to the blooding days prescribed; then being well shod give him the drink, the same with what you gave him at your putting him out, and let him be kept in a clean warm Stable, and well looked to, both as to his dressing and diet.</P>

<HEAD>Directions to cleanse your Horse, after taking up for comeliness and healths sake.</HEAD>
<P>THe day being fair and warm, three or four days after your Horse is taken up, lead him abroad, and gently rubbing him down, to take of the loose hairs, a∣noint him with sope, and then with warm water wash him all over, rubbing him with a Spunge or Linnen-cloth; but beware no sope gets into his Mouth, Eyes, Ears or Nostrils: After you have indifferently well cleansed him, rub him hard with a dry Woollen-cloath; then soaping him over again, rub him as aforesaid: which
<PB N="131" REF="79"/> done, take Buck-Lee and a hard wisp and wash him clean from froth or foam, and after∣ward with a Woollen-cloth exceeding dry leaving no wet hair about him, lead him into the Stable, cloathing him by degrees till you have wrapped him up in all his cloaths. This way is many times used, as well to conceal stollen Horses, as for the Horses health, for by so rubbing, the Horse is so altered in colour, slickness and shape, that the owner without extraordi∣nary prying cannot directly challenge him.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to prepare your Horse for any Medicine, in case you find the distemper has effectually seised him.</HEAD>
<P>OBserve that two days before you in∣tend to administer the potion, whe∣ther Pill, Powder or Drench composed of simples; that you permit him to eat neither Hay nor Straw, or indeed any hard meat, not admitting of easie digesture, thereby to hinder the operation of the Physick, and for twelve hours before keep him from all manner of meats, for empti∣ness gives a free operation to the purgati∣on, when fullness by obstructing it may
<PB N="132" REF="80"/> turn the force thereof upon the vitals, and thereby do much harm to the Horse. The safest meat to prepare him is either Rye or Wheat-Bran mixed with splent-beans, or Bread made of Bean and Wheat-flower, mixed with clean Oats, and his drink warm water, with a little fine flower or bran shaked into it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What purgations may be given with the least danger.</HEAD>
<P>THe gentlest and most effectual purga∣tions are Pills, but in giving Physick you must consider the state of your Horses body, whether he be strong or weak, or rather the end for which you purge him, in relation to the distemper for which he receives the dose. To make the gen∣tlest Pills, good aginst any infectious or pestilential disease take these directions, <HI>viz.</HI> peel 20 Cloves of Garlick, bruise them and temper them with a pound of sweet butter, and rouling them up into balls as big as Hen-eggs, put four or five of them down the Horses throat, and they will work out the pestilential humours, if they have not seised the heart, brain or Liver. Another sort of gentle pills may be made after this manner: take a quarter of a
<PB N="133" REF="80"/> pound of red Saunders, and the like quan∣tity of fresh butter, mix them well together, and making them up as the former, give them your Horse in like manner. Another harmless purge may be made of Rosema∣ry leaves bruised and mixed with butter; and lastly green figgs bruised and made into pills or balls with sweet butter and given him, have almost the same effects: All of them gently purging, mostly by Sweat and Urine.</P>

<HEAD>Things to be observed in Physicking a Horse.</HEAD>
<P>IN all Drenches or Glisters, let the heat not exceed the warmth of blood, for if it does it will prove offensive, nothing being more obnoxious than things admini∣stered too hot or too cold; let what you administer be given not over hastily, lest if it be given down his throat, you choak or overcharge his weasand, and by that means cause him by coughing or straining, to cast it up. In giving him balls, you must if they be any thing large, draw forth his Tongue, that he may swallow them easily and not be obliged to strain himself, thrusting them down as far as you can before you let go his Tongue, the which being suddainly dismissed will force them down: Ever observe to administer your potions when the Horse is fasting, either by the space of one whole night, or three hours at the least, unless the suddainness of a distemper prevent such conveniency: for upon an empty stomach the physick will have the more effectual operation, and the better eradicate the gross and vi∣tious humours, which generate most di∣stempers, likewise be sure upon what oc∣casion
<PB N="139" REF="83"/> soever he takes physick, that he fasts two or three hours after its recep∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>Exercise to be observed upon the Reception of Physick.</HEAD>
<P>IF you are desirous the Physick should work, then as soon as your Horse has received it, course him about moderate∣ly, not exceeding a Pace or Trot, or if he be weakened by any distemper, then walk him gently under some warm hedge for the space of a Mile, then bringing him into the Stable rub him down with dry cloaths, and cloathing him warm, let him stand the time aforesaid, before you give him any meat; all the while you or your Groom observing his postures, and how the Physick operates, by which you may discern what his di∣stemper is, and whether it afflicts him more or less.</P>

<HEAD>What is to be observed in raking your Horse, who cannot dung without pain.</HEAD>
<P>WHen your Horse is troubled with any obstruction in the Fundament, you with your hand must often draw away the dung which he through its hardness or his weakness cannot otherwise avoid without great pain, the which when you do, you must anoint your hand with Oyle of Olives, or Neats-foot Oyle, which will greatly allay the heat, and for the future render him more capable of casting his dung; or if to make him laxative, in such a case you give him a Glister, anoint the quill or pipe with Olive Oyle or Hogs Lard.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What further is to be observed in Phlebotomy or blood-letting.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to be observed that you ought to take a due proportion of blood from the Horse, according to his age, strength, or the quality of the distemper. If he be a strong Horse, full grown, take from him four times the quantity from him, as you take from a Colt of a year old: but if he be an old Horse and weak of constitution,
<PB N="141" REF="84"/> twice the quantity. If he have a Pleurisie or any violent distemper, occasioned by rankness of blood, then you may let him blood, if you see the distemper threaten his life, three days together, but not suffer him to bleed excessively at one time. The causes for which Horses ought to bleed, are either to preserve health by diminish∣ing the superfluity of blood, that burns or heats the veins; to divert sickness, or chear the vital spirits, by giving the blood a free and uncontrouled passage, after which you must moderately chafe or walk him, to make the blood fill those veins or branches that were emptied, and to make him bleed the freer; suffer him to drink warm water be∣fore you open the Vein.</P>
<P>If he bleed not freely, it is a sign that he is pursie, fat, or the blood stagnated, then to oblige him thereto put your finger in his mouth, tickle him, and cause him to move his Jaws, thereby to press the vein to a more facil evacuation, and having bled sufficiently, take part of the blood mingled with salt, and pour it down his throat, with a Drenching-horn, and with the other part bathe his body whilst it is warm, which is excellent in a consumption, moist cough, or weakness of the Limbs.</P>

<P>IF your Horse be rank of blood, his eyes will be red, his veins strut, prick and itch, especially in his Tail and Main, so that he will be often rubbing himself, his Hair shedding at unseasonable times, the roots of his Ears pill, and the place where his headstal is fastened become bare, his Urine will be of a high and reddish colour, his Dung black and hard, or little bumps red and fiery appearing on his back, faulter at his meat: if the whites of his eyes be yellow, or the inside of either lip, of the same colour, then is it apparent that he is over charged with blood, or that his blood is watery and full of evil hu∣mours.</P>

<P>Fourthly, observe if the Horse be San∣guin, his blood produceth a white thick matter, but if Colerick, a waterish salt and thin matter, though in quantity small. If Phlegmatick, great store of watery gelly, as it were; but if Melanchly, dry Scabs only.</P>
<P>Fifthly, observe as I have before hinted, never to bleed your Horse but upon the days prescribed, and not then for fansie sake, but in case of some distemper that requires it, or to prevent a sickness imminent by reason of bad or boiling blood, which afflicts the Veins.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Observe in all Imposthumes or swelling Sores, called Tumors, diligently to note the place where the grief began its increase, state and dangerous consequence, as likewise its declination and ending.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Take notice, that if in the beginning of every swelling Imposthume, you cannot eradicate it, use Repercus∣sive medicines; if it be not too near the vi∣tals or some other principal part of the body; if it be, you must forbear the use of such Medicines or applications, lest thereby you indanger the Horses life, but rather use softening and suppling medicines, till such time as the Imposthume, Tumor or swel∣ling be ripe, and then with a Lancet let out
<PB N="145" REF="86"/> the corruption, and by degrees dry it up with cleansing and healing medicines.</P>
<P>Eighthly, All soft or hard swellings ought to have different applications according to the part of the body where they happen, or the cause from which they proceed; as for hard swellings, they are for the most part corrosive, and the soft unless well regarded, of long continuance. Now to know whether a swelling has been of long standing, especially in the legs, press it with your finger, and suddainly taking it away, if you perceive the flesh immediately to fill the dint, then the swelling is newly taken, but if it stand hollow, then is the swelling of a long standing, proceeding from some old hurt, and will not be removed without difficulty.</P>
<P>Ninthly, If Sores matter moderately, then it denotes they cure a pace; but if the putrefaction increase more and more, it of∣ten times denotes inward rottenness.</P>
<P>Tenthly, Observe that Cauterizing with hot Irons, always straineth things inlarged, dissolveth gatherings or hardness; dryeth up mosture, draweth to one place dispersed humours, and helpeth old griefs, by causing them to ripen speedily, and avoid the matte∣ry humour they contain; in cauterizing take notice also that you burn sometimes
<PB N="146" REF="87"/> under the sore to divert the humour, and sometimes above to defend and keep back the humour: as for burning, it is done two ways, the one called Actual, and the other Potential. The former being done with hot Irons, and the latter with hot Oyles, Waters, and other Causticks, and Corro∣sives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the Sickness called the Antecor.</HEAD>
<P>THis Antecor or heart sickness, is si∣tuated near the heart: and is known by a swelling in the middle of the Breast, and is caused by excessive feeding, without any considerable exercise to cause digestion, as also by the Horses being over strained, in immoderate journeying, heating or cour∣sing, or after a heat by taking cold for want of diligent looking after and good
<PB N="148" REF="88"/> dressing, corrupting the blood thereby, and destroying the Horse, unless speedy and ef∣fectual Remedies are applyed. Now to cure this distemper, after the swelling ap∣pears, whereby you must distinguish it from other distempers: First let the Horse blood on both sides the neck, taking thence a good quantity, and give him dia∣pente, or the powder of five simples be∣fore mentioned, in ALE or Beer, adding thereto an ounce of brown Sugar-candy pul∣verized, and half an ounce of <HI>London</HI> Treacle, which will remove the infection from the heart; after which to allay the swelling, take Barrows-grease, and Basilicon, of each three ounces, and having well tem∣pered them, anoint it with the said unguent, rubbing it hard on with your warm hands till the swelling become soft, then with a Lancet open it, and having let forth the corruption, anoint or wash it with Cop∣peras-water, and taint it with a taint dipped in green oyntment: to make which I shall hereafter shew you.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Blood Spavin, what it is, and how to cure it.</HEAD>
<P>THis grief is occasioned by (and in∣deed is no other than) a soft swelling growing through the Hough, commonly filled with blood, being largest on the in∣ner
<PB N="156" REF="92"/> side, by reason of its being fed by the master vein descending to the Pastern, and has its original from the corrupted blood that settles there, by hard riding or immoderate, labour: Especially when the Horse is young, and his Hoof tender, if it harden 'tis more difficult to be cured than otherwise. To cure it, having shaved a∣way the hair on either side the swelling, take up the thigh vein, and bleed it well, tying the vein above the place you strike, which will extract the blood gathered a∣bout the Spavin, after which slit the swelling, and prick it likewise on either side the Hoof where the Spavin is, that so the me∣dicine may operate with more ease, and to better effect than otherwise it would do; and when the corrupted blood and water is well pressed out, then lay a plaister to the grievance made of Bolearmoniack, and whites of Eggs, the which, after one days continuance, remove and wash the place with this bath or supplement, <HI>viz.</HI> Take Mallows, tops of Nettles, and boyl them in Spring water, till they are soft, after which bath him therewith; whereupon take Brancha, Ursian, Wax, Oyle, Mal∣low roots, and French-wine, of each a proportionable quantity, and having boyled them, bind them about the place grieved
<PB N="157" REF="92"/> with a linnen cloth, as hot as he can indure it, the which continue for the space of three or four days, stroaking it gently with your hand every day, to cause the corrupt blood to avoid; after which make a plaister of Stone-pitch, Carana and Brimstone; of the two former an ounce of each, and of the latter a quarter of an ounce, adding to them half an ounce of Turpentine, and apply it, being spread upon Leather, to the place grieved, binding it hard, and per∣mitting it to remain till it fall off of its own accord.</P>

<P>THe Itching all over a Horses body, is either occasioned by inflammation of the blood, by heating or suddainly taking cold, by which means the salt watery humours get between the flesh and skin, which occasions the Horse to scrub and rub himself against Posts, Trees and Bushes, so that if it be not timely heeded, it will turn to the Mange, and by that means insect such Horses as accompany him. To prevent which, and cure the former, let him blood in the neck vein, and rub him all over with a hard brush or hard wisps; then take Staves-acre, Elecampain roots, Chickweed and leaves of Brambles, of each a handful, boyl them in Cow piss, and add to them the powders of Sublimate-Mercury dryed; Briony, and Red dock roots, Arsnick,
<PB N="159" REF="93"/> Resalgar, with which wash him all over, but especially in the place you perceive him to rub most; or for want of these take Hogs-grease, Mans-Urine, Tobacco leaves or stalks, Brimstone, Verdigrease, Train-Oyl and Allum, with which well conco∣cted anoint the body of your Horse.</P>

<HEAD>The Botts or Worms, what they are, and how to kill them.</HEAD>
<P>THese Insects breeding in the body of a Horse, are of three sorts, distinguished by the names of Botts, Truncheons and Mawworms, the first for the most part breeding in the great guts near the Funda∣ment, the second in the Maw, out of which if they be not speedily killed, they will eat their passage, to the destruction of the Horse, the third and last called Maw∣worms, or plain worms, breed in the guts as the first. The Botts are small worms with little tails and great heads. The Trun∣cheons are thick and short, and have hard heads. The Mawworms are long and slen∣der, of a reddish colourm, any of them being as long as a mans finger, and these worms are generated from raw gross and Phleg∣matick
<PB N="160" REF="94"/> humours, occasioned by foul feed∣ing. To know whether your Horse be troubled with them or not, you must observe whether he kick at his belly with his feet when he stands still, turns his head towards his tail, looking upon his body, Groans, Wallows, Frisks his tail often, or forsakes his meat, all which are signs of worms in his body: To cure which, take a quart of New-milk, four ounces of hony, which being made warm, give it him fasting in the morning, and suffer him to fast after it two hours, then dissolve an ounce of black sope in a pint of beer and give it him, and an hour after ride him hard, and the worms will either come away alive, or dye in his body; or for want of these take Savin stamped to the quantity of a hand∣ful, and put it in a quart of Beer or a quart of Brine, and it will destroy them.</P>

<P>THis prejudice of sight happens (as likewise all other distempers of the Eyes) through two causes, <HI>viz,</HI> either in∣ternal or external, the internal cause pro∣ceeds from cold rhumes or fiery salt humours that fall upon the sight; and the external cause from a blow, hurt by Lightening, fire or the like. To cure which, take these di∣rections. To clear and take away the bloodshot, or setling of blood in the Eyes, taketh juice of Sowthistle, by some called our Ladys thistle, and spirit it into his eyes once or twice a day, for divers days toge∣ther; if your Horse be dimsighted, or have a thin Film over his eyes, take the juice of Cabbage or Colewortstalks, boyl it with a small quantity of hony, and spirt it into his eyes, and in so doing six or seven times, it will consume the Film and clear the sight; nay, take away the Canker in the Eye, if it be not too far gone. To take away the Pin and Web in the Eye, spirt into it the juice of Celen∣dine,
<PB N="164" REF="96"/> the which is likewise exceeding good to clear the sight, as likewise doth the juice of ordinary Centaury: if your Horse be trou∣bled with Moon Eyes, put into them Ale∣hoof or ground Ivy juice, and it will re∣store him to a perfect sight. If your Horse be troubled with salt fiery humours or Rhumes in his Eyes, wash them with the juice of Houseleek, and by so doing often, it will allay the heat and drive back the Rhume; the juices of Germander and Eyebright, consume the Pin and Web in the Eyes, and greatly restore the sight. Ale∣hoof, Daisie flowers and Snap-dragons be∣ing bruised and strained with a little Rose-water and fine Sugar, dissolved in the juice cure all manner of Itching, Smarting, Inflammation, Spots, Webs and the like, restoring the sight when almost lost. The juice of Tree Ivy leaves, after they have been sufficiently steeped in water easeth presently; and in process of time takes away all smarting and pain of the eyes. The juice of Endive clears the sight, and so does the distilled water of Groundsel, and the juice of Melliot with many other Herbs in general: but for brevities sake waving them, I shall now come to the particulars, more narrowly observing the cures for most, of all the Eye distempers.</P>

<P>The second cometh by an extraordinary slip that breaks some sinew or ligament, parting in a manner the shoulder from the breast, rendering the Horse exceeding lame.</P>
<P>The third is when the point or pitch of the shoulder is dislocated, known by the sticking of the sharp bone, and is got by some fall or extraordinary wrench: To cure all which, keep the Horses so grieved in a Stable without the least mo∣lesting them, then putting them on Pastern shooes; take of Dialthea one pound, the like quantity of Olive Oyl, Fresh Butter and Oyl of Bays, of each half a pound; the which melted and made into an Oint∣ment, anoint therewith the grieved part, suppleing it with your hands for three or four days, morning, noon and night; at the end of which if the shoulder swell, as past doubt it will, prick it with a Lancet or

<P>When the shoulder is brought right, take two wooden pins of Ash or Elme, each five inches long, anoint them with Hogs-lard or Deers suit, and slitting the skin about an inch above the point of the shoulder blade in four places, thrust the Pins in crosswise, gathering up as much of the skin as is possible, then take strong Packthread or Whipcord, and fastening one end to the uppermost part of the cross; for both the ends of the pins which ought to be flat, must appear without the skin, twist it round as hard as is convenient; at what time anoint it Hogs-lard and with Oyl of Cammomil, suffer him to rest in a warm

<HEAD>Hoofs, how many sorts there are, their perfe∣ctions and imperfections.</HEAD>
<P>OF Hoofs, there are divers kinds, some perfect, and others imperfect: The imperfect Hoof, is when any part is lack∣ing; or if it be unseemly, spreading broad,
<PB N="267" REF="147"/> and being exceeding flat, that no shooe will sit compleatly upon it, for such Horses for the most part are narrow heel'd, on which he for the most part treads, render∣ing himself thereby unable for Travailing, subjecting him frequently to cast his shooes, and subject to false quarters; and this is often caused by the Horses being brought up in moist and Fenny ground. To shoo which, not being as yet grown to too flat, the Farrier with his paring Iron must take off as much of the Toe and sides as it is possible, still keeping it round, but let him not touch the quarter or the heel, unless it be to make the seat of the shoo plain, and let that be as lightly as may be, still anointing the Hoofs with Hogs-grease and Oyl of Baies, and within a while they will become round thick and feasable: The shoo wherewith this Hoof must be brought to perfection, must be made strong, with a broad webb, and broad Spunges, pierced from the quarters to the hard Toe, but not to the Heel, the holes wider without than within, and the foot diligently pared as aforesaid, from the Tallon nail towards the heel, suffer the shoo to stand a straws breadth with∣out the Hoof; the better to save the Coffin, let your nails be made of good Iron, the
<PB N="268" REF="148"/> heads square, but not so broad above as be∣low, that they may not only stand above the shooe, but fill the holes, putting five nails on the outside, and four on the inside, be∣cause in this case the Horse weareth more within than without.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The perfect Hoof on the forefeet, how to pare, shooe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the Hoof be perfect, first pare the seat of the Shooe as even and plain as may be, that the shooe sitting close may bear no more on the one side than on the other, nor take more on the Toe than the Heel; for the Heels must be higher than the Toes, but by reason all the weight of the Horses fore part presses up∣on the quarters, and heels of the fore feet, those parts must be most regarded, and as little of the Butteresses taken off as may be; for the heels are naturally weaker than the toes: but this is meant by the fore-feet only, for the paring of the hinder-feet is quite contrary, as will hereafter ap∣pear.</P>
<P>For the most exact method of shooing the perfect Hoof, observe these following rules, <HI>viz.</HI> Let your shooe be of Spanish Iron, or other well tempered Iron, the
<PB N="269" REF="148"/> web broad, fitting it to the Hoof, the Spunges thick and more firm than any o∣ther part, and somewhat broad that the quarters may stand somewhat beyond the Hoof, to preserve the Coffin, and pierce it from the quarter to the hard toe, but not backwards towards the heel, suffer the holes to be wider without than within, that the pierced circle may be more distant from the edge of the toe than from the edge of the quarter, because the Hoof is thicker forward than backwards: thus having fitted the shoo, take nails made of the same Iron, the Heads square, though not fully so broad be∣neath as above, that the nails may fill up the holes, and the shooe be kept from stirring, suffering them to appear somewhat above the shooe, and let the points appear in a just line, not one lower than another, or in and out like the teeth of a Saw, and cut them off so near that when they are clinched, by a little raising the Hoof with a Knife they appear to be within it: but be sure, ere the shooe is fastened with any more than two nails, see it stand right, by looking on the Frush, and suffering the Horse to set his foot to the ground, whilst you hold up the other with your hand; and if the shooe stand but a little awry, you may by stri∣king the Hoof with your Hammer bring it
<PB N="270" REF="149"/> to rights; then with a Rasp pare the Hoof, till the edges appear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Brittle and Rugged Hoof, Long Hooof, Crooked Hoof, Flat Hoof, Broad Frushes and narrow Heels, what they are, and how to be used.</HEAD>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THe rough and brittle is rugged and full of crinkles or seams like a Rams Horn, caused by the intemperature of the foot, either too hot or dry, to remedy which bind it about with Hogs-grease, Marshmallows and Oyl of Earth∣worms, still chafing the legs to disperse the hot humours, and in so doing, in a weeks time the hoof will be greatly sof∣tened, at what time with a Rasp file off the ruggedness as well as you can, but come not too near the quick; then ha∣ving a shooe in readiness, neither too heavy nor too light, set it on with nine nails, five without and four within, stop his feet with Cow-dung, fryed in Hogs-grease, and let him run in moist ground.</P>
<PB N="271" REF="149"/>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The long hoof is that which causes the Horse for the most part to tread upon his heel, going as it were on his Pasterns, which occasions Windgalls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To help which, pare away the toe and the buttresses answerable; anointing it with hot butter, till you have brought it to the fashion of a perfect hoof; then having a shooe round at the toe as may be, and if the foot be narrow, let the shooe appear a straws breadth without the hoof, and pierce the shooe the deeper, set it more backward than to other Horses is usual, because Horses having such feet, do tread more backward than others, fix it on with eight nails, and suffer not the hoof afterwards to grow long.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The crooked hoof is when the hoof is broad without and narrow within, rendring the Horse splay-footed, by tread∣ing inwardly, subjecting him to interfe∣ring, and often lameness: in paring this hoof, observe which side is highest, and then levelling it, pare the rest like the perfect hoof; let the shooe in this case be strong, with a broad web, fitted to the foot, by paring, setting the strong∣est part of the shooe to the weakest part of the hoof, and fasten it on with
<PB N="272" REF="150"/> nine nails, five without and four within.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The flat hoof is much of the nature of the imperfect hoof: in paring this hoof you must take away the toe, till you can make the shooe sit compleat, as also the sides, the heel and ball touch not, but let them remain as strong as pos∣sible: Then having a shooe with a broad Web, for the more it covers the weak sole, the more commodious it is, permit∣ting the Middle part of the web that covers the Ball of the Foot to be much thicker than the other; where the piercings are, and so hollow that it touch no part of the Ball of the Foot, large enough in eve∣ry part, so that he may go easily, pier∣cing it round the toe, to favour the heels, and fastened on with five nails on a side.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Broad Frushes are when the Frushes are broad, the heels weak and soft, that they may be in a manner bent together, which makes him tread ginger∣ly or painfully on stony or hard ground: in paring this hoof you must be very cautious, paring only the toe and a little the seat of the shooe, lest you lame your Horse: The shooe must be stronger to∣ward the heel than the toe, and the Web in that part broadest: set on this shooe with
<PB N="273" REF="150"/> nine nails, and in all other respects use it as the perfect hoof.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Narrow heels are frequently tender and of no long indurance, in which case you must pare the toe short, making the seat of the shooe fair and plain, and open only, that there may be a little space between the Frush and the heel: for the better it is, the less you take off the heel: The shooe for this purpose must be light, the Web broad, and the Sponges almost meet: let the piercing be all to∣wards the toe, sparing the heel so much as you can, suffering it to be long e∣nough that way, and fasten it with eight nails. If the hoof be over hollow, yet firm, pare it round about the edges, es∣pecially the seat of the shooe, to the intent the hollowness within may not be so deep, always keep it moist with stopping it, for fear of hoof-binding; and let the shooe be in all points the same with that directed for the perfect hoof. And thus much for the fore feet.</P>

<HEAD>Paring and Shooing the hinder feet, false quar∣ter, and interfering of divers sorts of shooes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>First,</HI> OBserve that in paring the hinder feet, the toe is the weakest part, and must be most spared; as for the rest you may use them as the fore feet, as the perfe∣ction or imperfection admits: The shooe in this case must be exactly fitted to the hoof, strongest at the toe, and pierced near to the heel, because the toe is the weakest part of the foot; let the outside be made with a calkin, not so high, but that the others spunge may be agreeable with it; this calking is to keep the Horse from sliding, and must be rather blunt than sharp poin∣ted, and handsomly turned upwards.</P>
<P>The shooe for a foot that has the false quarter must be exactly fitted, and tacked on to that side where the false quarter is. If he do not halt, then make him a but∣ton or shouldering on the inside of the shooe next the soal of the foot somewhat distant from the false quarter, near the toe, which will defend the sore place, and make the Horse fit for Travail.</P>

<P>In case of interfering, the hoofs are high∣er on the one side than the other, <HI>viz.</HI> the outside; wherefore it must be careful∣ly taken off, and both sides made even; or if it be possible let the inside be left some∣what the highest; and fitting the shooe, let the inward part be the thickest, with∣out any calking, and the edges close to the hoof: but if the foot be hoof-bound, make him a shooe like a half Moon, paring the toe as short as may be, and some∣what thin, opening at the same time the heels.</P>
<P>Divers other shooes there are in use, as the Planch shooe or Plauncelet shooes with Calkins, Rings, Welts, Turning-vice, Patten-shooes, Joynt-shooes, and shooes with swelling welts and borders, but seeing they are rarely used, and most of them more hurtful and incommodious, than profitable or decent: I shall pass them over, and only give you a touch of Roweling, which I hitherto purposely omitted, and then proceed to the Jockies part in this Treatise.</P>

<HEAD>Roweling what it is, and the Benefit that accrues thereby.</HEAD>
<P>THe manner of Roweling, when you perceive your Horse grieved by the gathering of evil humours, or in case of any violent sprain, Throw him upon soft straw, and with your Lancet slit the skin a handful below the place grieved, through the skin only let it be, and then with a Swan or Goose-quill, after with your Cornet you have raised the skin from the flesh, blow wind into it as much as may be, stopping the hole with your finger and thumb. Then having beaten the blow∣en place with a Hazle wand, let it go, and thrusting in your Roweling needle, which must be seven or eight inches long, let it come out above the place grieved, draw∣ing after it Hair or Sarsnet to the thickness of a mans finger, annointed with butter or Hogs-lard, stir it about, and every day dress it with Lard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The which will cause the corruption, though contracted deep in the flesh or in the joynts, to come away; but observe that you Rowel the same way the veins run, and not cross, for fear of laming your Horse.</P>
<PB N="277" REF="152"/>
<P>Another manner of Roweling there is, <HI>viz.</HI> opening a hole, and blowing it as a∣foresaid; then having raised the skin from the flesh, put in a round piece of stiff leather un-allumed, anointing it, and the leather having a hole in the middle, it must be placed against the hole in the skin, that the corruption may pass through: dress it every day as the former. The helps got by Roweling are these, it disperseth, dissolveth, and bringeth away evil humours, loosening those parts that are bound, and binding those parts which are loose, streng∣theneth the joynts, and draws away cold Phlegmatick humours; it is generally done in case of inward strains about the shoul∣ders or hips, for hard swellings, which will not be mollified nor corroded by out∣ward applications; with divers the like at∣tributes, which for brevity sake, and by reason they are known to most Farriers, I shall omit.</P>

<HEAD>The Intreagues, Artifices, Over-reach∣ing deceits, and cheats of those Deal∣ers in Horse-flesh, known by the name of JOCKIES.</HEAD>
<P>THat the Jockey is the very Quintessence of Knavery in Masquerade, few that have had to do with any of them can de∣ny: an Animal he is, that lives by deceiv∣ing,
<PB N="279" REF="153"/> and it is not an easie matter to be a crafts Master in that profession; for no∣thing but a prompt wit with an extraor∣dinary stock of impudence and long ex∣perience can go thorow stitch with those affairs: wherefore divers dealers in Horses are undeservedly called Jockies, or in∣deed are but younger brothers in the pro∣fession, to make the elders Markets, as Files are to the Divers; but without any long detaining you, I shall open their Arcana or Cabinet of false wares and devices, with which they gull the ignorant, and at a dear rate make them purchase wit. But to the purpose.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Jockies device to cheat the Buyer, with a blind or lame Horse.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Horse be blind through age or ac∣cident, or with excessive riding, and his sight irrecoverably lost, though no Pin, Web, Haw, Film, or the like be apparent, but the defect is in the very center of the Eye, by the defect of nerves, insensibly that con∣vey the speculative sight to the twinkles. Then the Jocky having dressed him up to the best advantage, keeps him two or three days at high feeding, and still as he comes
<PB N="280" REF="154"/> to dress strikes, him over the face and eyes with his whip or wand, till the Horse with the least suddain noise, fearing the coming of the whip or switch, tosses up his head, and winks, as if he foresaw it, which deceives the buyer, in supposing he does so. Another way the Jockey has in often blowing ground Pepper, Ginger, Salt or Allum into the Horses eyes, which makes him always so fearful of being tormented in that nature, that when the Jockey has brought him to Market, and his eyes are questioned, he presently swears they are perfect (being seldom without a Budget full of new minted Oaths) and thereupon tells the Buyer that with the least motion of his hand the Horse shall start, mount his head, or shut his eyes; which proves so by this means, the Jockey has always in his pocket small shot less than pins heads, Rapeseed or the like, a few of which he unperceived of the Buyer, holds between his finger and thumb, and upon the motion of his hand fillips them into the Horses face or eyes, who upon the least feeling, supposing that he is about to be tormented, throws up his head, winks or starts: nay, he so orders it by buffeting him with his hat often
<PB N="281" REF="154"/> when he has him by himself, that when he feels the wind thereof, he will start: by which the unskilful Buyer frequently de∣ceives himself, whilst the Jockey laughs in his sleeve. Another trick he has by touching the Horse on the knees, or under the belly, to make him mount his head, which he brings him to by former check∣ing of a rigid curb bridle, fastned to those places; if you ask him to ride the Horse, unless it be in a plain field or even Road, he will tell you he would not have you put your self to that trouble, but he'l call some poor boy or other, and give him a peny to do it, that so he may the bet∣er observe his going: then has he saun∣tering up and down, or standing aloof, an arch Rogue of his own, acquainted with all the infirmities of the Horse, whom he calls, as if he had never before seen him, and he manages the Horse to the satisfaction of the Jockey and Buyer: If there be any visible obstructi∣on of sight, and the Jockey cannot re∣move it, then having blowed powder of Tartar into his Eye or Eyes, which will for five or six hours after cause him to wink, that the Blemish cannot be easily discerned, he chuses to ex∣pose
<PB N="282" REF="155"/> such a Horse to sale in a gloomy day or by Candlelight. These and many more Artifices he uses, to put off a blind Horse.</P>
<P>If the Jockey has bought a lame or foun∣dred Horse for little or nothing, pretend∣ing that he designs him for the Dogs, and indeed he is so incurable, that he is fit for little else; then bringing him home, he alters him by trimming, makes a Blaze or Star, where there was none, putting him on false locks, or taking away Spots, Stars or Marks, so that sometimes the first owner, not knowing him, has bought him again of the Jockey at a dear rate. The Horse thus accoutered, he feeds high with Mashes and the like, washing his limbs with the decoction or broth of Sheeps heads, Mallows and Smallage, bathing them with hot Oyles; if the lameness pro∣ceed from cold distempers, or if from hot or any casualty, then with cooling oint∣ments well heated and chafed, giving him a scowring or two, then pricking his sides on the spurring places, he rubs in powder of Glass, decently covering it with the hair, then stops the Horses feet with flax dipped in Pitch or Tarr, and paring them every day, brings them into good form and evenness, putting on exceeding heavy
<PB N="283" REF="155"/> shooes, that by being used to them he may be the more nimble when light ones are placed in their stead: thus having used him, if he be a Foundred Horse he loggs him him with Lead, placing plates thereof un∣der his shooes, to support his hoofs, and make him tread firm, but if subject to Aches, Sprains, Spavin, Ringbone, Scratch∣es or the like, washing his legs down, he binds them about with Lists till he comes into the Market, and then in his Inn, or some Corner, taking them off, he sets a light Lad upon him, having first rubbed hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tuel with Cowitch or young nettles, and then has he divers to cheapen him, and seeming altogether strangers to him, offer to strike him Earnest at a pretty round rate; which he in a great heat refuses, wondering they will undervalue his Horse and their own judgments: upon which they begin to handle him, and rubbing the place where the glass has fretted, cause him to winch and caper, then having well viewed him, they swear he is sound, Wind and Limb, and that he may be worth the mony; but he is to buy for a friend, and must not exceed his order, though had he occasion for one for him∣self, against the world he would have a
<PB N="284" REF="156"/> good one, and so goes away: This sets divers unexperienced buyers agog, who no sooner begin to handle the Horse, but a fellow comes and whispers the Jockey in the ear, as supposed to come from him that last bid mony, with new offers, and then strikes him Earnest, yet he refuses it: whereupon for fear the Horse should be bought up, whom the Standers by suppose to be of singular goodness, one or other bids money, which the Jock∣ey seems to slight, standing at a great distance till he has screwed up as high as he can, and perceives none else forward in bidding, then all on a suddain he claps up the bargain, swearing he is too cheap, yet he has no pasture or convenient standing for him, or else he would not sell him for half as much more. And thus is the ignorant Buyer cheated, perhaps with a Lame, Spavened, Foundred and infirm Horse, buying Dogs meat instead of a serviceable Beast.</P>

<P>THe Jockey having bought an Old dull Jade altogether unserviceable, yet if he be well limbed, and of good stature, he brings him home, feeds him high, gives him every morning balls of Honey and Wheatflower, spirting into his mouth Malmsey or Brandy, kembs him down, pleats his main, and clips his foretop in form; when if the pits of his eyes be hollow, whereby his age appears he slits the skin with a penknife, raises it up, puts into it a straw or Crow-quill, and by that means blowing into it, the hollowness rises and fills the pit, when up∣on the hole he claps a small plaister of Pitch, till the wind is setled, and the hole closed; the like he does to his Flanks and shoulders, then he Rasps or Files the hoofs, to take a way the ruggidness, and pares them smooth: which done, with a Pumicestone he makes his teeth white, and with a hot Iron makes a round black speck in his mark tooth, and uses him to hold up his head with a
<PB N="286" REF="157"/> strong Curb-bridle, starching his ears if he have any, and into them putting two small Pease or Pebbles; then leads he him into the Market, where he has in readiness a Sad∣dle, in the forepart of which is a plate of Iron with two or three holes, so that when he bears his body forward, sharp wyers that bear down with a spring come through those holes, and pricking the Horse miserably in his tenderest part, make him daunce and caper: which the Buyer impu∣ting to his mettle, and perceiving no imper∣fection in him, cheats himself, whilest he gives credit to the Oaths and Protestations of the Jockey.</P>

<HEAD>The Jockeys Art in managing a Restiff Horse, suddainly making a lean Horse far, and re∣claiming a Horse that has got the vice of lying down in the Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Jockey has always his eyes about him, and when he hears any one has a restif stubborn Horse, that he can bring to no good order either in Journey or Work∣ing, then he sends one of his Accomplices to borrow that Horse if it be possible, to
<PB N="287" REF="157"/> ride 6 or 7 miles, who upon his return dis∣parages him, swearing he is not worth six∣pence more than his skin, and that if he was his he would send him to the Dogs, if he could not sell him: this and the like ex∣pressions make the party have a mean conceit of his Beast, when soon after, the Jockey finds some means or other to have a sight of him, and then as if ignorant of the Horses defect, demands whose he is, and whether he will be sold: Then the owner much out of love with him is wheedled in by the Jockey (who pretends himself altogether unskillfull in Horse flesh) to sell him at a low rate, or swap him away for some foundred Jade new vamped: The Jockey having gotten him into his clutches, the first thing he does, sets one upon his back, and fastning a Cracker un∣der his Tail, sets fire to it, which makes the Horse run and caper extreamly; then having a Crupper with sharp needles in that part which goes under the Tail, yet cannot prick by reason of a spungy wollen list they must pierce through, un∣less the Rider pull the Crupper, then at the same time smacking his whip, the Horse verily believes the Crakers are at his Arse again, and so runs forward, then
<PB N="288" REF="158"/> having perfected him, he day by day sup∣les his joynts, and feeds him high, so that within a short time he becomes an excellent Beast</P>
<P>If the Jockey buys a lean Horse fit for nothing to appearance but Dogs, so be it he be any thing young and well boned, he first lets him blood, then dres∣ses him at all points with supple oint∣ments, loosening his skin; after which he gives him half a peck of Beans boyled in sweet Oyl and Muscadel, and within two hours after half a peck of Bran boyled in small wort, and in it two ounces of Fen∣nelseed, and as much Cumminseed, and powder of Liquorish, keeping him in a warm Stable very dark, and often renewing his Litter. The watter he gives him is for the most part warm, mingled with Milk or Whey, giving him often sweet wort and Mashes of Malt, daily loosening his skin; and when he has brought him into some case, then he makes a powder of Cummin and Fennegreekseeds, the Roots of Mountain-Osier, Cloves, Nutmeg, Brimstone and Sugarcandy, which he moulds up in a ball of wheat and Linseed Flower made into past with Milk and Hony, giving him one morning and even∣ing
<PB N="28" REF="158"/> for six days, and between whiles boyl∣ed Oats, Bran, and Splent Beans, in which Nettleseeds have been scattered, so that at the end of ten or twelve days the Horse will be in good case: then the Jockey ha∣ving slit the skin of his Flanks and eye∣pits, with a quill, blows them up to the best advantage, and so carries him to Market, where he sells him at a good rate: when the Buyer carrying him home, and giving him ordinary Provender, his fat which was hastily gotten and no ways solid, but rather windy and gellied hu∣mour puffing him up, decreases almost as soon as gotten, and restores him to his primitive leanness, which occasions ma∣ny to believe their Horses are bewitch∣ed, and to suspect their Neighbours in that case, when it proceeds from the cheat and roguery of the Jockey.</P>
<P>If any person have a well made Horse who is in good case, but is subject to lye down when he comes into any wa∣ter, and for that trick the owner is weary of him, the Jockey by one means or other insinuates himself into his company, and finds occasion to discourse about Horses, when he after divers discourses swears he had once (but thanks God he has part∣ed
<PB N="290" REF="159"/> with him) a Horse that had the worst of all vices, which was, that as soon as he came into any water, whether deep or shallow, he would notwithstanding his utmost indeavour to prevent it, lye down with him: so that he often indangered his drowning, and seldom or never that he rode abroad with him in winter-weather, but he ducked him over head and ears before his return. By this means he gets the party to confess that he has a Horse troubled with the same vice, then begins he to disparage and exclaim against him, saying, that he is fit for no use, and that 'tis impossible to make him leave it; for that being foaled under <HI>Leo,</HI> a hot and fiery sign, it is as well his nature as cu∣stom; then he tells him a sham story, how he parted with his Horse for little or thing, only upon that account. Having thus put the owner out of conceit with him, he soon after perswades him to carry him to Market, and sell him; where the Jockey has alway one ready to buy him up, and when he has got him, he rides him into the water; then suffering him to lye down, he having three or four to assist him, holds his head so long un∣der water, that he almost stifles him,
<PB N="291" REF="159"/> whipping him in the mean while severely, and by so using him three or four times, he so dreads the water, that if it be pos∣sible he will upon all occasions shun it, and never after venture to lie down in it. Thus not only upon these, but up∣on divers other pretences he bubbles the unexperienced to his own advan∣tage.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Jockies craft in making Horses seemingly lame or dangerously sick, and the cheats he puts upon the unwary, with false Eyes, false Ears, false Manes, Tails, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SEldom it is but the Jockey has one Horse or other standing at Livery amongst divers Gentlemens Horses, and by frequently coming to visit his own, takes a view of them, and understands unto whom they appertain; when mark∣ing out one of them as best likes him, he, as near as he by inquiry can, understands the owner is to ride forth, with certain haires or fine silk, and a small needle takes up the Fetlock vein, which soon makes the Horse halt down lame: then
<PB N="292" REF="160"/> the Gentleman being acquainted there∣with orders the Hostler to carry him to the Farrier that his feet may be search∣ed, and the cause if possible found out, but in vain the Farrier puzels himself in searching the foot, and so cunningly has the Jockey smoothed over the cause, that without great curiosity it cannot be discovered: whereupon 'tis conclu∣ded to proceed from an old Founder, a former Surfeit, the effects of some Quitter-bone, Ring-bone or Spavin, not formerly cured, or the like. Whereupon the Gentleman despairing of his Horses recovery, so soon as his urgent occasions require it, fumes and storms at a desperate rate, when the Jockey being at hand, as one ignorant of the matter, demands the cause of his disturbance; then being told it, he pities the beast, and comforts the owner, confirming the opinion of the Farrier, who freequently is of his con∣federacy, offering the Gentleman rather than he shall be disappointed of his jour∣ney, either to lend, sell or swap with him; of one of which he commonly makes his advantage: but if he succeeds not in any of them; then pretending great skill in Farrying, reckoning up ma∣ny
<PB N="293" REF="160"/> hundred Horses which he has cured of all distempers and Sorrances, he undertakes to cure him for so much money, perhaps half a piece or more, which he performs by taking away the needle, silk or hair, and suppling the place with Oyl of Baies; though that he may seem to deserve his money, he uses ma∣ny slipslops altogether useless and unne∣cessary.</P>
<P>Another trick the Jockey has to make a Horse in all parts appear as if he were dying, which is to thrust down his throat a ball made with flower of Ches∣nuts, and a mixture of six Grains of Opium, at what time he puts in as before, either to lend, sell, swap, buy or cure: another way he has to make a Horse Tremble, Sweat, Pant, Stair, and the like, whilst the Farrier in vain uses medicines to cure him, which he does by thrusting a Stone as big as a peny whiteloaf, dipped in Oyl of Spike into the Horses Fundament: the former of these he antidotes with the juice of Rue, and Olive Oyl; and the latter he eases by draw∣ing forth the stone, anointing his Funda∣ment with Hogs-lard, and whilst he caus∣es and cures, he frequently sends the
<PB N="294" REF="161"/> Hostler for a pot of Ale, or about some such frivolous errand, that he may not discover the knavery.</P>
<P>If the Jockey has a Horse with one or both eyes intirely out, he seeks for a Horse newly dead; and taking forth his eyes, he steeps them a night in white∣wine, which makes them plump and bright; then he forces them into the lids of the blind Horse, glewing together the further corners to keep them in, and teaches the Horse to start, as be∣fore I have discovered them; having well accout ed him he brings him to Market in the Evening, or in a very gloomy day, and by that means cheats the ignorant buyer, supposing he has bought an excellent penyworth; tho' the next morning perhaps through the Horses straining he finds his false eyes in the Manger, which he im∣putes to the incantation of some Witch, Wizard, Incubus, or envious neigh∣bour.</P>
<P>If a Horse has lost his Main, and ap∣pears unseemly, the Jockey shaving it close, takes the Main of a dead Horse, skin and all, and having well dried or dressed it, sews it so artificially to the live Horses skin, that it must be a curi∣ous
<PB N="295" REF="161"/> eye that discovers it, by reason the upper part being glewed makes it sit compleat and fast: the like measures he takes to set on false Ears, false Foretops, and false Tails; and some have gone so far that when a Horse through age has lost his Teeth, they have set him in artificial ones, as the Teeth of young dead Hor∣ses, and so deceived the Buyer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Jockies art in making of Stars, Snips, Blazes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the Jockey designs to disguise or beautifie a Horse, then he first alters them by making Stars, Snips, or taking out Saddle-spots: and all these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey can do so artificially that if the Horse be stolen, the owner cannot know him a∣gain. To make a white Star, Blaze or Snip in a Black or Sorrel Horse, he cuts a piece of Lead, being before flatted pro∣portionable to what he intends; then shaving off the hair, he with a Lancet raises the skin and thrusts in the Lead, being dipped in Oyl of Tartar, suffering
<PB N="296" REF="162"/> it to rest there four days, then taking it out claps the skin close, so that the hair growing again, becomes as white as milk.</P>
<P>To make a Red Star, Blaze or Snip in a White-Horse, he shaves away the hair, and anoints the skin with Oyl of Vitriol, Soot, and the juice of Hem∣lock. To make a Black Star in a White Horse, he uses the decoction of Fern-roots, Soot or Ink, and the wood of O∣liander, the which when he has raised the skin, he puts under, suffering it there to remain, and by so doing the hair immediately becomes Black: nay if he has had a Horse often to the Market, and he has there been blown upon, he will dye him a quite contrary colour; and though he be troubled with most di∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pers incident to Horses, yet will he swear he has neither Splint, Spavin nor Windgal, Scratches, Crepances nor Rats-tails, Mules nor Cibil-heels, Sellender nor Mallender, Curb, Ringbone nor Quitterbone, Houghbone, Sit-fast, An∣bury nor Vives, neither Farcine, Foun∣der-footed, Broken-winded, Grease Mol∣ten, or Running Glaunders: but good Eyes, good Thighs, and every thing

<HEAD>A TREATISE OF CATTLE. Their Ordering, Cure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving treated largely of the Horse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I shall now proceed to satis∣fie the reader in the management of other useful Cattle, and first of the Bull, Ox, Cow and Calf. The Bull most fit to get a good breed, must be long
<PB N="299" REF="163"/> bodied, of colour Red, broad shoulder∣ed, strong-boned, not over large of bo∣dy, his breast broad, his head short, and full foreheaded, his eyes black and full, his Horns smooth and short, and his Tail long and Bushy. The Cow must not be too large nor too small, rather long than short, her Rump broad, of colour Black, with some changeable spots of White or Red, her Wind-pipe large, her Womb the like, her forehead flat and broad, her Eyes large and Black, her Horns long, but smooth, and for the most part black, great Mouth, thin Cheeks, wide Nostrils, large Dew-laps, long and thick-neck, broad Shoulders long Tail, smooth and even Claws, long Teats, and broad Breast: and in making these obser∣vations in your choice, you will seldom or never miss of a good breed, if you order them accordingly, <HI>viz.</HI> put not your Heifer to the Bull, till she be three years old, and suffer her not to bear Calves for store after twelve. The best time to put her to the Bull is in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June;</HI> and to know when she is desirous of him, observe if the Claws of her feet be swollen, the which if they be, then is it a sign of Lust in her, and that she
<PB N="300" REF="164"/> is desirous to be covered, or by her continual lowing, the same may be known; and that she may the sooner conceive, keep her with spare diet, two or three days before you lead her to the Bull, and the leaner the better, though the Bull at the same time must be in good Case; if she refuse to take the Bull, or that the Bull be backward, burn Harts-Tail under their noses, or rub the Cows Reception place with Nettleseeds, or ground Ginger, and af∣terwards with a Sponge, with which Sponge rub the Bulls nose, and by so doing you will provoke them to desire: when the Cow has so often received the Bull as you think convenient, put her into a warm house for a weeks space, not milking her in that time, unless her Udders stretch, then put her into an inclosed field, where she cannot leap out, nor run through Bushes, suffering her often to drink clear water, and in so ordering her at ten months end she will bring you a lusty Calf or two, if no casualty prevent it.</P>
<P>When your Cow has Calved, you must give her a comfortable dose, <HI>viz.</HI> half a pint of Malmsey, four new laid
<PB N="301" REF="164"/> Eggs, and a pint of Ale mixed together, suffering the Calf to lie by her in fresh and warm straw: and as soon as you find he has recovered any strength, put him to the Teat, at what time if you perceive him bubble and rather mumble the Teat than suck, or if it be at any time after, look under his tongue, and if you there perceive a white fleshy sub∣stance growing over the Tongue, cut it away with a sharp pair of Scissars, with∣out wounding the Tongue, washing it there∣upon with Water, Salt and the juice of Garlick, and when the Calf begins to grow up, it you perceive he is trou∣bled with Lice, or afflicted with Scabs, keep him in fresh straw, and wash him with urine, wherein Butter and Colewort-stalks have been boiled.</P>
<P>In gelding your Calf, that he may so be an Ox, the best time is at a year and half Old, when the Moon is in the Wane, observing that the sign at that time, be not in <HI>Libra, Scorpio,</HI> nor <HI>Sagittarius.</HI> The manner of gelding must be thus, throw him on soft Straw, ha∣ving good help to hold him, that he hurt not himself with strugling, then taking one Cod between your fingers, slit it so
<PB N="302" REF="165"/> wide that the Stone may come forth, which being done, use the other in the like man∣ner, and drawing them forth, put the strings between a cleft stick, hold them hard, and sear them off with a hot Iron, then melt bees-wax on the heads of the strings, and having anointed them and the Cod with warm butter, put them up, and keep him in a warm house for two or three days, especially if the wea∣ther be cold, giving him milk dusted with Bran, chopped Hay, and crumbs of Bread, and in that time he will recover his ap∣petite; and soon after give him a purge, <HI>viz.</HI> half an ounce of Rubarb, and ten or twelve leaves of Spurg, Laurel boy∣led in a quart of small Ale, or an ounce of Lupinseeds boil'd in a pint of Whitewine, and by so doing you will preserve him from sickness, and render him strong and lusty.</P>

<P>IF the Bull, Cow, Calf or Ox be troubled with the Itch, Scab or Mange: To Cure them take the dregs of Oyl Olive, Ox Gall, the powder of Brimstone and Roach-Allum, of each two ounces, Vinegar half a pint, put them into a quart of Chamberly, and having well boyled them therein, bath the places grie∣ved with the liquid part thereof, and the cure will be effected.</P>
<P>If afflicted with the eating neck Sore, take three roots of Garlick, an ounce of Brimstone flower, sharp Vinegar a pint, six Galls, and a handfull of Soot, boyl them together, adding three ounces of Hogs-grease, till the liquid part is mostly con∣sumed, and it becomes so thick that it may be applyed to the grievance, plai∣sterwise, and by renewing it once or twice, the Cure will be effected. If afflicted

<P>Thus having chosen your Getter and Breeder, suffering neither of them to exceed three years old, the Ew is best when two years old, nor let any Ews bear Lambs for breed after seven years. The most convenient season for her to suffer the Ram is in <HI>October,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> that she may bring forth her Lamb or Lambs in the spring, at what time if her milk should fail, other nourish∣ments may be procured: during the time of her bearing, suffer her not to lie abroad in cold Snow or extream frosty weather, nor in excessive rains, and sometimes with her water, give her a handful of Salt and Fennelseed; when she has cast her Lamb, bring her into a warm house, and there
<PB N="317" REF="172"/> keep her for two or three days, that she and the Lamb may gather strength, giv∣ing her a Mash of Oats and Bran each mor∣ning. Many are of opinion that if the Ewe is covered by the Ram when she is feeding towards the North wind, she will bring forth a Ram Lamb, and when towards the South a Ewe Lamb; though to it I give not over much credit, nor to the tradition of knitting the right or left stone of the Ram to produce the like effects, nor that other opinion held by divers for Authentick, that whatsoever colour the Ewes tongue is of, when she conceives, of that colour the Lamb will be, whe∣ther White, Black, Speckled or the like.</P>

The Sow-pigs must not be spaied till eight or nine months old at soonest, and then it must be done with great caution, especi∣ally in cutting the slit, and sowing it up after the Matrix is taken out; for if the Guts be touched in cutting, or stitched to the side in sowing, the Sow will either soon dye or pine away.</P>
