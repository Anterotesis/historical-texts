<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIP∣FVLL, MASTER Thomas Smith, Sheriffe of the honorable Citie of London, and Gouernor of the famous companie of the English Marchants trading to the <HI>East Indies, Sumatra, Iava,</HI> the Isles of the <HI>Malucos, Banda,</HI> and the rich and mightie Kingdome of <HI>Chyna:</HI> and to the <HI>right VVorshipfull the Aldermen, and the rest of the Commit∣ties and societie of the said corporation.</HI> William Walker <HI>vvisheth all prosperitie and happie successe.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>Ight Worshipfull, who so takes but a sleight surueigh of the present state of things, must needes be forced to ac∣knowledge both the great and generall benefite likelie to ensue of this your in∣tended <HI>East Indie</HI> voyage, the successe prouing answerable to these forward be∣ginnings: and also the danger and losse on your parte, if it should (which God defend) fall out otherwise then well.</P>
<P>The benefit is most apparant, if we do but consider either the necessitie of the enterprise, or the gaine depen∣ding thereon. That the searching of new trades, &amp; aboue all other, this to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> is more then necessary, both the restraint of traffique in the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> dominions, and also the vnder-rate of the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> spices, in regarde of those brought out of the <HI>Indies</HI> by the way of <HI>Turkie,</HI> doe too plainelie demonstrate. Hereunto you may adde the venting of diuers naturall commodities, which otherwise would lye dead, and likewise the employment of tall and seruiceable Ships, and the increase of our Marriners knowledge in Nauigation: the gaine both to the augmenting of her Maiesties Customes, and the enriching of all the Aduenturers cannot chuse (as your selues best knowe) but proue in time extraordinarie Wherein, though I were silent, yet the <HI>Portugale</HI> Carracks, and within these few yeares also the Ships of <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> doe in a manner proclaime so much to all the world.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
The danger in attempting this action no man can doubt of: it be∣ing subiect to like difficulties and misaduentures with other honorable exploytes of the same kinde, and in that respect also farre more com∣mendable and praise-worthie: and so the losse (if matters should mis∣carrie, which God forbid) cannot be little, seeing the charges haue been so great.</P>
<P>These considerations (right Worshipfull) being seconded by the perswasion of M. <HI>Richard Hacluyt,</HI> a man for his matchles industrie in collecting the <HI>English Voyages,</HI> most incomparably wel deseruing of this state, preuailed so much with me, that being stirred vp with the zeale of a true <HI>Patriot</HI> or well willer to my natiue Countrie, I could not lesse doe, then cast into your <HI>East Indie</HI> treasurie this poore myte, I meane my labour in translating this little pamphlet, which containeth matter so agreeable and pertinent to this your present purpose.</P>
<P>For herein the <HI>Hollanders</HI> (who borrowed a great part of their light <NOTE PLACE="marg">All these Ʋoya∣ges, and sundrie other important discourses of the <HI>East Indies, Pegu, China,</HI> the <HI>Malucos, Philippinas</HI> and <HI>Iapan,</HI> are to be found in the second and third volumes of M. <HI>Hakluyts</HI> English Ʋoya∣ges,</NOTE> from vs, namely out of the famous Voyages of Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> Ma∣ster <HI>Thomas Candish,</HI> Master <HI>Iames Lancaster, Ralph Fitch,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Stephans,</HI> their forerunners in those parts, and haue had speciall assi∣stance in their late Nauigations by the meanes of Master <HI>Iohn Dauies,</HI> Master <HI>Timothie Shotton,</HI> and other skilfull Pylots of our Nation) doe in ample manner requite vs with the like: acquainting vs with their Voyages, discoueries and dangers, both outward and homeward; with their negotiation and traffique at <HI>Iava,</HI> the <HI>Malucos,</HI> and other places, with the disposition of the naturall inhabitance, and the slye sullen practises of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and likewise with the quantie and value of Spices and other commodities which they brought home.</P>
<P>Heere therefore your Captaines, Masters, and Factors (notwith∣standing they are very sufficiently informed alreadie) may in some sorte be directed how to shape their course to auoide many perrils, and to enioy seuerall kindes of Marchandize for which you send them.</P>
<P>And albeit both your selues and they also, in regarde of your deepe insight and experience in these matters, may seeme not much to stand in neede of this my endeuour, yet remembring an olde rule in lawe, that <HI>Superabundans cautela non nocet:</HI> sure I was, that some good might come hereof, but harme none at all.</P>
<P>It may please you therefore (right Worshipfull) to take it in kinde part, if not for the worthines of the matter, yet for the sincere intent of him that offers it, who in this, and in all other your worthie disseignes, wisheth you most prosperous successe, and stands continuallie deuoted to your seruice.</P>

<P>The first shippe was called <HI>Mauritius,</HI> wherein <HI>Iacob</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mauriti∣us.</NOTE> <HI>Corneliszen Neck</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> was Admirall, and <HI>Goua∣ert Lanszen</HI> master.</P>

<P>The seuenth being the greater Pinnase, was called <HI>Vries∣land,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Freeslad</NOTE> whose master was <HI>Iohn Corneliszen.</HI></P>
<P>The eight ship was the smaller Pinnase called <HI>Ouerysell,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ouer-Ysell.</NOTE> wherein <HI>Simon Ianszen Hoen</HI> was master.</P>
<P>In these aforesaid eight ships were some 560. men, mu∣stred the 9. day of March.</P>
<P>The 13. day of March we set sayle, and departed from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and the nine and twentieth day of the said Mo∣neth, the great ships were towed ouer the <HI>Pampus</HI> by thrée water ships.</P>
<P>The fourth of April the ship called <HI>Hollandia,</HI> came néere vnto the sand of <HI>Encusen,</HI> where she was forced to cut down her foremast, by reason of the great storme, and fowle wea∣ther: and the two and twentieth day we came to the <HI>Tex∣ell,</HI> where wee remained eight dayes for a good winde to carrie vs thence.</P>
<P>The first day of May we set saile from the <HI>Texell,</HI> hauing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno 1598. The. 1. day of May we sailed from the Texell.</NOTE> the wind at South east.</P>
<P>The third day we passed by <HI>Douer,</HI> where we spake with certaine ships of warre, and the fourth day wee had sight of <HI>Wicht, Portland,</HI> and <HI>Beuiser.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth day came a small ship of <HI>Enchusen,</HI> into our fleete in the Spanish seas, which came from <HI>Aueren,</HI> and a∣bout two houres after, our smaller Pinnases sayled after her with letters, and brought some ten thousand Oringes with her, which were distributed among the ships: so that euerie man had eight Oringes.</P>
<P>The 11. day we were in the height of the <HI>Burlings,</HI> at which time 25. men in the shippe called <HI>Gelderland</HI> were christened.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
The 15. day we had fight of the Iles of <HI>Madera</HI> and <HI>Sar∣tes.</HI></P>
<P>The 17. day before noone we were passed the Ilandes of <HI>Canaria,</HI> namely, <HI>Gomera</HI> and the <HI>Palm.</HI></P>
<P>The 23. day we passed by the salt Ilands, to wit, the Ile of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>S. Iago.</HI></P>
<P>The nine and twentieth day being in the height of fire degrées, wee were forced to strike our sayles, by reason of tempests and fowle weather, which continued about two howres.</P>
<P>The first day of Iune we tooke a Torteyse, waying an <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tor∣teyse ta∣ke way∣ing 143 pounds.</NOTE> hundreth thrée and fortie pounds.</P>
<P>The 5 day <HI>Gerrit Ianszen</HI> of <HI>Alkmar</HI> leapt ouer boord, into the sea, out of the great Pinnase.</P>
<P>The 6. day came a flying fish into the ship called <HI>Gelder∣land,</HI> which was very strange vnto vs.</P>
<P>The 8. day we passed vnder the Equinoctiall line with a fine fresh gale, and then euerie messe had a canne of wine al∣lowed them.</P>
<P>The 25. day euery messe had thrée cannes of wine allow∣ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The sho els of Brasilia passed, for which was great ioy among vs.</NOTE> for ioy that wee were passed the shoels of <HI>Brasilia,</HI> lying 18. degrées south the Equinoctiall line.</P>
<P>The 26. day the small Pinnase lost vs, by reason of the mists: and the twentie seuenth day the Admirall sent out the Shippe called <HI>Hollandia</HI> to seeke the saide Pin∣nase.</P>
<P>The eight and twentieth day of the saide Moneth in the morning, wee sayled towardes the Iland, and after wee were approached neere vnto the shore, we manned two boates, and rowed on land to seeke for some refre∣shing.</P>
<P>The 29. day the ship <HI>Hollandia</HI> returned into the fléete with the small Pinnase, at which time the first execution
<PB REF="7"/>
of iustice was done aboord the ship called <HI>Gilderland:</HI> at this place wee saw mightie shoels of birds, as great as Storkes.</P>
<P>The 24. of Iuly we tooke the height of Cape <HI>de Bona Esperance,</HI> which lieth 33. degrees from the <HI>E∣quinoctiall</HI> line.</P>
<P>The 27. of the said month, we saw driuing on the wa∣ter great long logges or truncks of wood, whereof some were 20. or 25. fadome long: we saw also great store of great birds, which is a verie good marke of the Cape <HI>de Bona Esperance.</HI></P>
<P>The 28. day of the sayd month, wée fastned againe our Cables to our Ankers: the same night we had a great storme, so that we were forced to take in our sayles: and we saw the same night a <HI>Corpus sanctus</HI> in our maine <NOTE PLACE="marg">The 29. of Iulie, foure of our ships lost our cōpanie, being in the height of C.

<P>The 29 day, wée lost the companie of foure of our ships, but betwéene the 30. and the 31. day in the night, thrée of them returned vnto the fléete, so that wee wanted but one, which was <HI>Claes Ianszen Melknap</HI> of <HI>Horne.</HI></P>
<P>The 31. of Iuly in the morning, we had sight of Cape <HI>Bona Esperance.</HI></P>
<P>The 2. day of August we dranke our last Béere, and we beganne our first allowance to drinke water, foure mutskins or measures euerie day, and thrée of wine.</P>
<P>The 7. of August wee had againe a stout gale of wind at South east, so that wee were forced to strike our top masts.</P>
<P>The 8. day towards the euening it lightned and thun∣dred mightily, so that we were glad to take in our sailes. The same night we lost our Admirall, the <HI>Hollandia,</HI> and the small Pinnase, by meanes of the great thunder and lightning.</P>
<P>The 14. day our Committées and masters had bene
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
aboord the Ʋice-Admiral, and had diminished our allow∣ance of wine, ordayning vs one and a halfe mutskins or measures of wine, and sixe of water for euerie messe.</P>
<P>The 15. of August, wee saw a little place in the Sea, where the water séemed to boyle, as a kettle that seetheth on the fire: the water was of a berie gray colour, it ex∣tended the length of an arrow shot, and in breadth the length of a shippe: we sayled through it, but wee percei∣ued not any great strangenesse therein.</P>
<P>The 17. day iustice was executed in our shippe, for some offences therein committed.</P>
<P>The 18. day we met with a contrarie winde, and we kept our course for the most part South east: the same day we saw many Whales.</P>
<P>The 20 day we had store of raine, with thunder and lightning, at which time the Ʋice Admiralles fore-top-mast was broken in three peeces: the same day the wind changed, so that we held our course East Northeast, ma∣king good way.</P>
<P>The 22. day of the sayd month, the ship called the <HI>Ze∣land</HI> returned to our fleete, which was about 25. dayes after she had beene missing, so that now wee were fiue ships in companie.</P>
<P>The 24. of August, the companie of the <HI>Zealand</HI> fet∣ched another mast out of the <HI>Gelderland,</HI> to make ano∣ther fore-mast, for shee had lost her mast in the foresayd storme, when she parted from vs, and had beene in great daunger.</P>
<P>The same day wee had sight of the land called Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> or <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which gaue great ioy and com∣fort to all in our shippes: and the 25. day we made to the land, for wee saw wee could not passe the necke land of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> therefore we ankered neere vnto the necke of the land, which was the first time that we did cast any
<PB REF="8"/>
anker, since we departed from the Texell.</P>
<P>The 26. day in the morning, we manned foure boats, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure boates rowed to the shore of Mada∣gascar, &amp; what happe∣ned vn∣to them neere the shore.</NOTE> and rowed to the land, to see if wee might there find any refreshing: &amp; comming neere the shoare, the beate of the <HI>Vtrecht</HI> was with the folke therein ouerturned, and one of the quarter masters of the boate drowned, called <HI>Iohn Pamer of Amsterdam:</HI> and the same day we had a storme, so that we were forced to depart thence, for our Ʋice Ad∣mirall, the <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the <HI>Zealand,</HI> the great Pinnase, and the ship of the deanerie &amp; Chapter of <HI>Vtrecht</HI> lost e∣uerie one of them an anker, but the <HI>Gelderland</HI> rode out the storme.</P>
<P>The 17. day of the sayd month in the morning, wée wayed our anker, and sayled after the other ships, which were vnder sayle in sight, hauing a fayre wind, we kept our course East South east, to reach the Cape of Saint <HI>Sebastian,</HI> and the 29. day in the morning we left the said Cape behind vs.</P>
<P>The 30. day wee passed the Cape <HI>de Iulian,</HI> and were becalmed, the wind contrarie, and darke weather.</P>
<P>The 4. day of September, all the Marchants and Ma∣sters <NOTE PLACE="marg">Septem∣ber.</NOTE> went aboord the Ʋice-Admirall, where it was a∣mongst thē debated, whether wee should put into the bay of <HI>Antongil,</HI> or direct our course towards <HI>Bantam:</HI> but in the end it was concluded to kéepe our course.</P>
<P>The 5. day of September wee were allowed againe three mutskins of wine, and foure of water, without <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ile de Cer∣ne, other wise cal∣led the Iland Mauriti∣us.</NOTE> porrage, by reason of the scarcitie of water: the same day we had also a good wind, so that we held our course East, and East and by North.</P>
<P>The 17. day wee had sight of an Island, called Ile <HI>de Cerne,</HI> which seemed to be verie hillie, so that we had good hope there to find fresh water, whereby wée were al greatly reioyced, for our ships began to be vexed with the
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
skuruie disease. <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they came to the land Mauriti∣us, wher they found a very fit and faire hauen, fresh water, and birds which they caught with their hands. The 20. of Septē ber most of our people were on shoare, where a Sermon was made in the fore∣noon, &amp; another in the af∣ternoon.</NOTE></P>
<P>The 18. day in the morning, wée rowed with two boates towards the shoare of the Isle <HI>de Cerne</HI> to sée if we might there find any fresh water, or releefe of victualles: and comming néere the land, wee rowed along the shoare, but could not find any open place conueuient for landing: whereupon our boate with the Committees went aboord the Ʋice-Admirall, where it was appoynted that our boate should row to another part of the Island, to search for some conuenient place of landing: whereupon (the boate manned with seuen men, after they had rowed to shoare and made diligent search) found a very faire cio∣sed hauen, where fiftie ships might lie, defended from all winds, and good ground for ankeridge: towards the eue∣ning the boate returned, and came aboord the Ʋice Ad∣mirall, bringing with them eight or nine great birds, and many small, which they had taken with their hands: also they found there very faire and swéete water, that came from the hilles, which caused great ioy in the shippes a∣mong our people, that they might haue their bellies ful of fresh water. This hauen is the fairest and fittest that a man may possibly find for refreshing. And the ninetéenth day we went further vp into the Island, where we found passing good ground to anker and rode at, fouretéene fa∣dome clay ground.</P>
<P>The 20. day the most part of all the people went a shoare, where they heard a Sermon made by a Mini∣ster of the Ʋice-Admirals shippe. It was now iust foure moneths and twentie dayes, since wee had set foote on a∣ny shoare, and that day we had double allowance of wine, for a remembrance of the Faire kept the same day at <HI>Amsterdam:</HI> and the same day we did nothing (because it was Sunday) but heard two Sermons in the morning and at afternoone, praysing and giuing heatlie thankes

vnto Almightie God, that he had conducted vs to this wi∣shed place of refreshing, for if wee had not found this place, many a man had not liued to tell what hee had séene, for the scuruie disease beganne mightily to vexe our people, and our water for the most part stunke, and was as blacke as kennell water, and (as the Pilot affir∣med) wee were then 500. leagues from <HI>Bantam:</HI> wee named this Island <HI>Mauritius.</HI></P>
<P>The 21. of the same month in the morning, our boate rowed to another place of the Island, to sée if they could find any inhabitants: in the end they came to a fresh riuer which descended from the mountaines, but they could not sée any people in the land. At this place wee fetched our water: for a man may row in with a boat, and with ease strike the same into the boate, so that it is a maruai∣lous commodious place to water. In this riuer our peo∣ple tooke so great quantitie of fowle, as they were all a∣ble to eate, for when we came neere them, they sate still, and could not flie from vs, so that we with our handes might easily take them: whereby wee noted that the land was not inhabited.</P>
<P>The 23. day certaine of our people went out with a small boate to fish with a net, which the Ʋice-Admirall had brought with him, for there was excéeding great plentie of fish.</P>
<P>The 24. day certaine were appoynted to row with a long boate to the land, to search if they could finde any other hole or place to come forth, beside the same which we had alreadie passed, by reason that the wind was con∣trarie, so that wee could not returne the same way wee came.</P>

<P>The 29. day, some of our people returned (which had béene sent into the land) without any desired newes, but onely that they had found a place where many Cokar∣trees grew, bringing some of the nuttes with them, and we furnished our selues with fresh water.</P>
<P>The 30. day some of our people went a shoare to get Cokar-nuts, at which time we had our first allowance of bread, to wit, euerie day one pound and a quarter.</P>
<P>The second day of October, we had a faire wind, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Octo∣ber.

<P>The 17. day we made an end of our last butter, and the wind was verie scant.</P>
<P>The 28. and 29. of October, the Sea was of a won∣derfull white colour, so that we imagined that wee were neere to some land, but wee could not discrie any land at all, and the same day in the morning wee had the sunne ouer our heades, and this was the second time that the sunne was right ouer vs.</P>

<HEAD>❧ A description of the Island de Cerne, which was now named Mauritius, lying 21. degrees to the South of the Equi∣noctiall line.</HEAD>
<P>THe Island <HI>de Cerne,</HI> named by the Hollanders <HI>Mauritius,</HI> lyeth 21. degrees to the South of the E∣quinoctiall line, and is in compasse some sixe miles or leagues, verie little more or lesse.</P>
<P>Such as will saile into this Island, must bring the two highest hilles into one, leauing the sixe small Islands on the right hand, kéeping tonne fadome water. On the left side of vs lay a small Island, which we named the Island of <HI>Hem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kerken,</HI> and the bay of the sayd Island of <HI>Cerne,</HI> we called after the name of our Ʋice-Admirall, The bay of <HI>Warwick:</HI> it hath a very faire hauen, where fiftie shippes maylie, defended from all windes and wea∣ther.</P>
<P>This foresaid Island <HI>Mauritius</HI> is not inhabited, nor neuer was, by all that we could iudge, for many and of∣ten times we ranne vp into the countrie, and found no people: but we iudged by the tamenesse of the birds and fowles that it must bee an vnfrequented place, by reason that men might take them plentifully with their hands.</P>
<P>It is a verie hie hillie land, so that for the most part it is couered with cloudes, and somtimes there passeth such a smoke or mist ouer the land, that a man can hardly see <NOTE PLACE="marg">The sci∣tuation and fer∣tilicie of Cerne.</NOTE> one another. For the most part it is all stonie ground, not withstanding very aboundant of wilde trees, which are there in innumerable sort, standing so thicke, that a man can hardly passe by them. These trees are as faire &amp;
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
euen wood, as may be found in any Countrey, as blacke as pitch, and as smoothe as a bone: on the out-side is a verie thicke greene barke, and vnder the barke is the black <HI>Eben,</HI> some with verie faire redde wood, and other some yellow as waxe, of which three sorts of wood, wée brought a little from thence for a proofe, and is found to be excellent faire and good.</P>
<P>Also it hath <HI>Palmites</HI> trees, whereby we were greatly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Palmites trees.</NOTE> refreshed, they grow like to the Cokar-trees, aloft in the toppe it carryeth the branches thicke and spreading: the same we cutte downe, and hauing taken out the pith, did eate: we made sometimes sallads thereof, which strongly purged and refreshed our bodyes.</P>
<P>We landed in this Island almost all our people, and found the same to be verie good and healthsome, so that we erected there some tents and cabbins, wherin we laid our sicke and diseased, which we brought from our ships, and there remained vntill they were recouered, which was in verie short time: whereby wee noted, that this Island was of a sweete and wholesome ayre.</P>
<P>After wee were all landed, wee had a Sermon in the forenoone, and another in the afternoone, thanking, and praysing God, that hee had brought vs to a place of so good refreshing for if we had not come to this place, many of vs had not liued to tell newes, for the scuruie disease beganne mightily to raigne among our people, and our water for the most part stunke, and was as blacke as kennell water: this happened iust when in foure months and twentie dayes before we had not set footing vpon a∣ny land.</P>
<P>Being now in the Isle <HI>Mauritius,</HI> we rowed with one of our boates to another place of the land, to search what inhabitants wee could find, but found none, onely wee came to a fresh riuer, which fell from the mountaines,
<PB REF="11"/>
where we tooke in fresh water for our ships.</P>
<P>Some of our companie went a fishing in a small <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the multi∣tude of fish.</NOTE> cocke, with a nette which the Ʋice-Admirall had brought with him, and we found that there was wonderfull plen∣tie of fish, so that at one draft we tooke néere two barrels and a halfe of fish, and could hardly draw the net, by rea∣son of the great number of fishes therein: and we tooke euerie day so great quantitie of fish, that we were not a∣ble to spend the same while it was fresh and sweet. Here we took a Chorn-backe that was so big, that wee, with the Marriners of our ship, had sufficient to eate thereof at two meales.</P>
<P>Here are great numbers of Torteyses, which are so big, that 4 of vs might stand vpon some one Torteyse, and yet it crept away with vs, in the shelles or shieldes whereof, tenne of vs haue had roome to sit.</P>
<P>This Island is very fruitfull, and plentifull of fowles, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fer∣tilitie of Cerne.</NOTE> as of Turtle Doues, whereof there are such plentie, that 3. of vs haue in one afternoone taken 150. and if wee had beene able to carrie them, we might haue taken more with our bare hands, &amp; killed them with cudgels. There are also great plenty of russet Parrets, &amp; of other colours: there are also other great fowles, as big as our Swans, hauing great heads, &amp; vpon their heads a skin, as if they had caps on their heads: they haue no wings at all, but in place of wings, they haue 3. or 4. black quils, and where their taile should be, they haue 4. or 5. small curled fea∣thers, &amp; their colour is grayish. Wee named these fowles Walghfowle (partly because they were tough in eating, how long time soeuer they sod: yet the crop &amp; breast were very good meat) but specially because we could take store of Turtle Doues, which were more delectable in taste.</P>
<P>There are yet other sorts of fowles good to bee eaten, which are called <HI>Rabos Forcados,</HI> because their tayles
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
are like in fashion to a taylers shéeres. These fowles are so tame, that a man may take them with his hands as they sate on their nest, and also kill them with staues and cudgels, insomuch that in the space of one halfe howre, we could fill a boate with them: whereby we presumed that there had neuer béene any people in the Island, for the birdes shunned no man, yea, they scarcely would for∣beare to come and sit on our heades, and so suffer them∣selues to bee taken.</P>
<P>In this Island we did set vp a Smithes sorge, where our Smith made and mended some Iron workes, and the Shipwrights made also a boate for the <HI>Vtricht,</HI> for she had lost her boat before Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> Island.</P>
<P>In this Isle <HI>de Cerne</HI> before mentioned, we found a∣bout 300. pound waight of waxe, whereon stood Gréeke Letters. We found also a Netting, with a Capsten bar, and a great Maineyard: whereby iudged, that some ship had there suffered wracke.</P>
<P>In this Island, our Ʋice-Admirall caused a shield of wood to be made &amp; fastned to a trée, to the end that if any <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ad mirall nayleth a boord or a shield to a tree, &amp; the rea∣son thereof.</NOTE> ships arriued at that place, they might perceiue y<SUP>e</SUP> Christi∣ans had béen there: &amp; thereupon was carued these words following, <HI>Christianos Reformados,</HI> reformed Christiās, with the armes of <HI>Holland, Zealand,</HI> and <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>Also there is in this Island a very large plain, wherof our Ʋice-Admirall caused a garden to be made, &amp; paled it round about, &amp; after did sow and plant al sorts of fruits, to proue if they would there grow &amp; increase. Our ships also left some Hens there, to proue whether they would there increase or not. Sundry times we sent of our folk vp into the Island, to vnderstand if there were any inhabitants on the further side of the Island: they were sometimes 3. or 4. dayes out before they returned, but they neither saw nor heard of any, no not of any 4. footed beasts.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="E"/> These are swéete riuers, where we caught such plenty of fish with our cock-boate, that somtimes we had 50 fi∣shes at one draught (which we named Trenchors by rea∣son of their flatnes) together with many other smal fishes of diuers sorts, so that oftētimes we thought that our net would breake, and with our ship-boate we were often∣times forced to helpe them to vnlade the cocke, because they could not without great labour and danger of sink∣ing, bring the cocke aboord: and (which is very strange) they swom in such innumerable multitudes hard along the shoare, that men might take them with their hands as they stood on the land, yea, oftentimes we killed them with our halfe-pikes.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="F"/> This is a fresh riuer, where wee filled our water with our boate: and heere wee caught a Thornebacke which was almost three yards in compasse, besides her taile, so that our people had much to doe to get it into the boate.</P>

These fowles we dressed and sod, but we found them so tough, that we could not (how long soeuer they sod) séethe them tender, but were faine to eate them so tough as they were. As soone as wee were entred into the Hauen, our Ʋice-Admirall sent some of vs with

the long boate ashore, to spie if there were any inhabi∣tants in the Iland, but wee found no creatures, except onely great quantitie of Turtle Doues, and other birds, whereof we caught, and killed with cudgels, great num∣bers: for seeing they had not beene accustomed to be fea∣red by any people there inhabiting, they had no feare of vs, but would sit still, suffering themselues to bee killed with staucs and cudgels. To be short, it is a plentifull land of fish and fowle, and so abundant, that in all our voyage we found not the like.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/> This is a Palme trée, which carrieth leaues so great, that a man may shrowd himselfe with one of them from the raine, and not be wet: if in this trée a hole bee bored, and a quill or tap put into the same, immediately there runneth out wine or liquour, hauing a swéete and plea∣sant taste like vnto sacke, but if it bee kept thrée or foure dayes, it waxeth Towre, and therefore it is called the Palme trée.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/> This is a bird or fowle, which we called <HI>Rabos Forca∣dos,</HI> for that their tayles are in shape resembling a Taylers sheeres: they were very tame, and little lesse then a fadome long, when they were stretched out: their bils are long, their backes most part blacke, and their breasts white: they eate flying fishes which they catch, and the guttes or garbell of other fish and fowle, as wee found by experience: for when we cast abroad our garbell of such fish and fowle as we had taken, yea of their owne kind, they would straight wayes come and deuoure the same: their flesh would not be sodden tender.</P>

<P>IT is to be vnderstood (Gentle Reader) that all the eight shippes kept companie, vntill they came neere to the <HI>C. de Bona Esperance,</HI> where they were parted and seue∣red by tempests and foule weather, namely the eight day of August, <HI>1598.</HI> but these fiue ships kept together, to wit, the <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the <HI>Zealand,</HI> the <HI>Gelderland,</HI> the <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> and the great Pinnase called <HI>Freesland,</HI> which happened to fall with the Island <HI>Mauritius,</HI> where we lay foureteene dayes, without any knowledge what was become of the other three shippes, the <HI>Mauritius</HI> our <HI>Admirall,</HI> the <HI>Hollandia,</HI> and of the small Pinnase called the <HI>Ouer-Ysel,</HI> which three shippes came from the Island of Saint <HI>Marie,</HI> and from thence sailed to <HI>Bantam.</HI> Of which three shippes we will make some relation, and of such matters as befell them in the Island of Saint <HI>Marie,</HI> at <HI>Bantam,</HI> and in their returne.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<P>After that these thrée shippes were parted and seuered <NOTE PLACE="marg">How 3. ships ar∣riued at the Islād S.

<P>In this Island we found not any great matter, com∣ming thither in a time out of season, for the Orringes were but blossomed, and the Lemons verie small, but we found some Sugar Canes, Hennes, and such like: And the people of the Countrey came to vs with two or
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
three small Oringes. Here we saw a strange manner of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner which the In∣diās vse to take whales.</NOTE> hunting: there were certaine Indians in a Canoas or boate, which had spied a Whale at Sea, who with their boate made out to take her: and after they had struck into her body an harping Iron, whereunto was fastened a long rope made of the inner barkes or péelings, next to the bodyes of trées, the Whale finding her selfe wounded, descended into the deepe, and they viering the rope to the whole length: not withstanding the Whale drew the boat after him as easily as if it had been a straw: but the Indians assuring thēselues vpō their expert swimming, feared not drowning, nor the ouerturning of their boate. Now after they had thus continued a while, vntill the Whale had tyred her selfe, and was out of breath, they towed her to the shoare, betwéene wind and water, and afterwards at low water they hewed her in peeces, and euerie one of them tooke as much as hee desired. Wee might haue taken thereof at our pleasures, but it looked so greazie, &amp; bacon like, that it went against our stomacks. Afterwards wee sayled to the great bay of <HI>Antongil,</HI> where we filled our vessels with water.</P>
<P>Our Indian, whose name was <HI>Madagascar,</HI> might haue remained at this place, but hee excused himselfe, that he would rather go with vs apparrelled, then remain in a place naked where he was vnknowne. Wee went vp the fresh riuer with our long boate, to seeke for fresh victuals, but the people of the Countrey made signes vnto vs to returne, for that there was nothing here to be had: yet wee rowed thrée leagues higher, but wee sped accor∣ding to the sayings of the Indians. This scarcitie was by reason that the Kings of the Island had warre, where∣by all things were spoyled and wasted, insomuch that the inhabitants themselues dyed with hunger and penurie. One of their Kings was slaine, wherefore wee stayed
<PB REF="15"/>
there but fiue dayes: but sayling from thence, we directed our course towards <HI>Iaua,</HI> and with Gods helpe arri∣ued at <HI>Bantam</HI> with all our thrée shippes as before, to wit, <HI>Mauritius</HI> our Admirall, whose master was <HI>Gouert Ianssen,</HI> and <HI>Corneles Hermskerck,</HI> one of the Com∣mitees, the ship <HI>Hollandia,</HI> wherein <HI>Simon Lambert∣sen Mau</HI> was Master, <HI>S.

<P>As soone as we were come vnto <HI>Bantam,</HI> we practised <NOTE PLACE="marg">How 3. shippes procu∣red the friend∣ship of those of Bantam, &amp; what gifts they presented to the king</NOTE> with all possible spéed, to attaine the friendship and good liking of these of <HI>Bantam,</HI> to which end <HI>Hemskerck</HI> was sent before to the town, to offer them trade and dealings in Marchandize (for they suspected we had been the same that had been there the last yeere, &amp; that kept themselues so long at sca, and that wée were Pirates &amp; théeues, as the Portingales had heretofore perswaded them) but wee excused ourselues, and made sufficient answere, after wee had sent <HI>Abdol</HI> vnto them, who was of that place, and brought thence the last yeere. The sayd <HI>Abdol,</HI> ha∣uing declared the good and friendly entertainment hee had found with vs, together with the rarities &amp; singula∣rities which he had séene in our Countrey, &amp; that wee had now many yéeres maintained mortall wars against the king of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Portingall,</HI> wee had fauourable au∣dience, and presented our gifts vnto the king being but a child: but the chiefe gouernour <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ephate,</HI> who had y<SUP>e</SUP> king∣like authoritie, receiued our gifts in the kings name, in verie thankfull manner: the gifts were a gilded cup, &amp; cer∣taine
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
péeces of veluet, and other draped silkes, with faire drinking glasses, &amp; gilded looking glasses; &amp; withall were presented letters of credite, vnder the hand &amp; seale of the worthie Lords the States, and of his Excellencie <HI>Graue Maurice,</HI> which were with great reuerence and créeping on their knées receiued. After that all these matters were finished, we began to buy and sell with those of <HI>Bantam,</HI> insomuch that the 4. day after, we began to lade, &amp; before the end of 4. or 5. weekes the ships were almost laden.</P>
<P>Thus after we had remained there some foure wéeks, our other 5. ships came sailing towards vs in good safety, hauing none of their people, or but very few sicke. Then we put out our flags, auncients, and streamers, saluting each other with our great ordinance in the best order.</P>
<P>Immediately after came certaine of their <HI>Praus</HI> or boates aboord vs, bringing great plentie of Hens, egges, Cokar-nuts, Bonouas, Sugar Canes, and Cakes of Rise. This was eucrie day to do, changing and bartring with them for wrought Tin: wee had for a Tin spoone as much victuals as a man was able to eate in seven dayes.</P>
<P><HI>Abdol</HI> did vs great hurt: for hee had not onely reported that there were fiue ships to come after vs, but also that there were more ships in rigging, to come thither out of <HI>Zealand,</HI> which was cause, that whereas at the first we <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pri∣ces of pepper at Bantā</NOTE> payed but 3. péeces of royals of eight for 55. pound of pep∣per, afterwards they raised it to 4. royals of eight: it was all royals of eight that they sought for; wares were no∣thing so well esteemed as money. It was very strange to vs, to see how the people of <HI>Iaua</HI> would signifie vnto vs, that there were fiue ships to come, shewing vs 4. fin∣gers and a thumb, which signe they made, saying, <HI>Lyma Shepen,</HI> meaning thereby, that there were yet 5. of our ships to come: for <HI>Lyma</HI> in their language signifieth fiue.</P>
<P>Here the gentle Reader is to vnderstand, y<SUP>t</SUP> besides the
<PB REF="16"/>
aforesaid three ships, a fourth (namely the great Pinnase called the <HI>Vriesland,</HI> wherof <HI>Iacob Cornelisson</HI> was ma∣ster, and <HI>Wouter Willekens</HI> Commissioner, laded in this place for <HI>Holland:</HI> all which foure ships being fully la∣den, gaue notice to all men of the town, that they would depart homewardes, and that therefore all such as they ought any money vnto, should come and receiue their payment.</P>
<P>Afterwardes (hauing made good prouision of Rise and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno 1599. the 11. of Ianu∣ary, 4. shippes well la∣den, de∣parted from Bantam towards Holland Diuers Com∣modi∣ties.</NOTE> water) they departed thence, and sayled vntill they came néere vnto <HI>Sumatra,</HI> where they tooke in fresh water: for the water of <HI>Bantam</HI> is white, and after a while groweth full of maggettes. At this place they bartred kniues, spoones, looking glasses, bels &amp; néedels, for many things, and much fruit; as Millons, Cucumbers, Onions, Gar∣licke and some small store of Pepper, but excellent good.</P>
<P>Some fewe dayes before the departure from <HI>Bantam</HI> of these foure ships, the other foure that had determined to séeke their lading further, and to that end to sayle to the Ilands of <HI>Moluccos,</HI> tooke leaue of the said laden ships, and the same night wherein they set sayle to depart, they thundred such a peale of ordinance, that it was heard o∣uer all the Iland, and the whole towne of <HI>Bantam</HI> was vp in armes, not knowing what the meaning thereof was: and thus these eyght ships parted from cath o∣ther.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>Bantam</HI> were very glad that they were gone: for euerie day they would inquire of vs when wee would depart: and to hasten our departure, they vsed all diligence to deliuer vs such wares as we had bought, for it was nothing at all pleasant vnto them, to sée vs lie there with eight ships together.</P>
<P>The foure ships aforesaid sayled from <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and came to the Iland of <HI>S. Helena,</HI> where they refreshed thē∣selues
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
eight dayesieng: there they found a Church, where∣in were some celles or boothes, with the Image of Saint <HI>Helena:</HI> there was also an holy water vessell, with a sprinckle but wee left all things as we found them, with certaine writings and memories of our being there.</P>
<P>The Island of Saint <HI>Helena</HI> (as <HI>Iohn Huyghen</HI> wri∣teth) <NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Islād of Saint Helena.</NOTE> aboundeth most plentifully with Kids, Coates, wilde Swine, Phesants, or Firid-hennes, Partridges, and Doues, but by meanes of much shooting and hunting, vsed by all and sundrie such shippes as there arriue, they are so wilde &amp; hard to be taken, that it was too too much paines and labour to vs to seeke after them. The Goates after they were shot, would runne from vs to the toppes of the stéepest Mountaines, where it was vnpossible for vs to come vnto them. Neither could we get so much fist, here as we gladly would haue had, but here we looke in our fresh water, whereof we had sufficient store vntill we came into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>In this Island we left behind vs <HI>Peter Gysbrechtsson,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause why Pe∣ter Ger∣brant∣ion was left in the Islād Saint Helena.</NOTE> Boat-swane of the great Pinnase, because he had strucken his master or shipper. We would willingly haue begged his pardon, but after that the orders &amp; articles were read whereunto we were al sworne, we could not, but (for exā∣ples sake) execute iustice. Notwithstanding, her had thus much fauour that there was deliuered vnto him some por∣tion of bread, oyle, and Rise, fish hookes and a peece with some quantitie of gunne powder, and so we all tooke, our leaue, and committed him to God, hoping that he will pre∣serue him from all ill, &amp; no doubt he shall come thence well inough, for as much as all ships which saile to the East In∣dies, must touch at this place to water &amp; refresh thēselues. As we departed thence, we saw afarre off, a small shippe, which seemed to vs, as neere as we could gesse, that it was a French man, directing his course thitherward wee hope
<PB REF="17"/>
that he is come into <HI>France</HI> in the same ship.</P>
<P>From this Island we sayled, and in short time, without any misaduenture, arriued in the Texell the 19 day of Iu∣ly 1599. God be praysed for it, to whom we cannot giue sufficient thanks for so good a voyage as we made: for since the time that <HI>Holland</HI> was <HI>Holland,</HI> there neuer came thi∣ther ships so richly laden, for they brought 400. last of Pepper, one hundreth last of Cloues, some store of Paces, Nutmegs, and Sinnamum. To conclude, we finished this long voyage in lesse then 15. moneths: for in seuen mo∣neths we sayled from the Texell to Bantam, the time wée lay still and were in lading, was 6. wéekes, and in 6. moneths wee returned home to <HI>Holland</HI> from <HI>Bantam,</HI> in which time outward &amp; homward, we sailed 8000. leagues.</P>
<P>The Marchants and venturers of the ships went with all spéede to the Texell, to order all things aboord the said ships, and to refresh the Marriners. The Committees, <HI>Cornelis Hemskerck,</HI> with <HI>Henrick Buyck,</HI> went with al spéede to his Prince-like Excellencie, declaring vnto him, not only these acceptable newes of the return of these ships from <HI>Bantam,</HI> but also deliuered vnto him letters, together with rich presents from the king of <HI>Iaua.</HI></P>
<P>The 27. day of Iuly, the Admirall, with the ship <HI>Hol∣landia,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1599. 27. Iuly.</NOTE> came before the town of <HI>Amsterdā</HI> with great noyse of 8. trumpets: the towne bestowed wine on them for their welcome, and all the bels were rung for ioy.
<Q><P>Gentle Reader, you haue breefely heard the successe of the 3. ships which lost the company of the other fiue: here∣after shall follow the Nauigation &amp; successe of the other afore-said fiue shippes.</P></Q></P>
<P>THe 1. of Nouem we met with another storm at sea, with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nouem∣ber.</NOTE> much raine, &amp; mighty wind, wherby our Ʋice-Admirall, the same night with the great Pinnase, lost our company.</P>
<P>The third day the Ʋice-Admirall with the Pinnase
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
returned vnto vs: the same day we saw many birds, and very much wood and trées driuing on the water. The <NOTE PLACE="marg">13</NOTE> same night dyed one of our folk in the ship of the Deane∣rie and Chapter of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> which was the first man that dyed in the fléet.</P>
<P>The 6. day of the said Moneth in the afternoone, there came néere vnto our ship a spoute, which is a whirle wind that taketh and carrieth the water vp out of the sea, which falling into a ship, will carrie away all things that are loose, and indaunger the ship: wherefore we tooke in our sailes with all spéed, tearing least perhaps they might therby receiue some dammage, &amp; in striking of the maine yard, our principall sayle-maker, called <HI>Ioost Janson</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> looking ouer-boord, to sée if any part of the sayle hung in the water, suddenly (as he was putting his head ouer the ships side) the mayne yarde fell loose from the mast aboue, and smote the said <HI>Ioost Ianson</HI> on his head starke dead, which was a great mischance, and he was the first man that dyed this voyage in that ship.</P>
<P>The 7. day in the morning we cast the said <HI>Ioost Ian∣son</HI> ouer-boord.</P>
<P>The 9. day his goods were sold before the maine mast, which were well solde, for that one Ryail of 8. was ac∣counted for 8. Gildernes and a halfe.</P>
<P>The same day wee were put to our first allowance of Oyle, to wit, wéekely two Mutskins, which maketh of our wine measure about halfe a pinte.</P>
<P>The 12. day the Ʋice-Admirall came aboord our ship to minister iustice, which was the first execution of iu∣stice that he did in these ships. The same day we had sight of an Island, and were in the night come néere to the land before we wist thereof, for it was a very low land: then we discharged a péece to warne the other ships thereof, &amp; then wended and put roome-ward.</P>
<P><PB REF="18"/>
The 13 day we saw thrée other small Ilands, where∣vpon the little Pinnase sayled that euening before vs, to see if we might saile on the farther side of one of the I∣lands or not, but the water was too shallow, for there lay out a great necke or corner of the Island, therefore wee cast about to seaward, and the same euening we cast our sounding lead in the first quarter, and had 20. faddome, and casting the lead againe, found but 15. faddome, the third time 11. faddome, and the fourth time 9. faddome, insomuch that we were in great danger of the sholes, but God preuented the same, for we held our ship turning, and suddenly came into the deepe, escaping the great danger wee were in, to lose our ship and our liues: for, doubting greatly that we should méet with great stormes and tem∣pests betwéene the Islands, we were drawne out of the right way, and brought into this error.</P>
<P>The 15. day wee had againe shallowe water at 13. faddome, but wee were out of sight of any land, which was a great wonder to finde such a shallow in the Sea so farre from any shore, for we could not sée any land at all.</P>
<P>The same day, we had againe a faire winde, so that we must hale in our sheates, and set our course East and by South, and East Southeast: the same day we shot a great Toonny, whereof there were in that place very ma∣ny, wherewith we made good chéere.</P>
<P>The 16. day of the saide moneth in the morning, wée had sight of another Island, so that we let slip our sheates to sayle beyond it. This Iland stretcheth to the South and North, and lyeth very low, and pleasantly to sée to: in the euening we were past this Island, and pulled in again our sheates: we held our course most East and by South, and East Southeast.</P>
<P>The 22. day in the afternoone wee had much rayne with a stouts gale of winde, so that wée were constray∣ned
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
to take in our top-sailes, the same night it lightened wonderfully.</P>
<P>The 24. day the Ʋice-Admiral gaue signe by putting out his streamer or banderoll, that all the Pilots should come aboord him, to take counsell together what course were best to be kept.</P>
<P>The 25. 26. and 27. dayes, wee had very still and calme weather, but towards the euening the wind came South southwest, and wee helde our course most East southeast.</P>
<P>The 28. day in the morning the wind slacked, and we directed our course East, and East, and by North: wee turned by the wind, the weather being very faire, in the night the winde came Westerly, so that we shaped our course East southeast, and Southeast and by East.</P>
<P>The 30. day the Ʋice-Admirals preacher came aboord our shippe, where hee made vnto vs a godly and learned Sermon.</P>
<P>The first day of December we had the wind faire, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Decem∣ber.</NOTE> the same day wee began first to eate of our smoaked or dryed flesh, which remained as yet very good and swéete.</P>
<P>The 2. 4. 5. 6. and 7. dayes we had calme and still wea∣ther, with variable winds, and some while a pretie little gale, and sometimes small showres of rayne: this day we might beholde squales and snakes driuing in the water, whereby we knew that we were néere vnto the land.</P>
<P>The 8. day wee had also mutable windes with some small showres and gusts of rayne, with thunder, the wea∣ther being very still and calme, and towards the euening it began to blow a fine swéete gale from the West north∣west, so that we haled in our sheates, and held our course East southeast: the same night a flying fish came flying into our ship.</P>
<P>The 9. day it blew a fine gale, the wind westerly, and
<PB REF="19"/>
we held our course for the most part East Southeast: a∣bout noonetide one of our company fell from the sprit∣saile yard, and was drowned, for before we could hoyse out our boat, he sunke: his name was <HI>Gerbrand Iacobs∣zen</HI> of <HI>Alckmar,</HI> and a common marriner. There fell another ouer-boord also, who was one of the vnder Ship∣wrights, and was browned with the other. His name was <HI>Tymon Ianszen</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> so that this day we lost two of our company.</P>
<P>The same day also dyed one aboord the Ʋice-Admi∣rall, and one aboord the Pinnase: Thus in this one day we lost foure men in in our fléete of fiue ships.</P>
<P>The 10. day the wind continued fayre, shaping our course most East Southeast, the weather faire: at noone we tooke the height, and found we were eight degrées to the South of the Equinoctiall line.</P>
<P>The 12. 13. and 14. dayes continued faire weather, except new &amp; then a little missing raine, and the same day we saw multitudes of birds, and scum of the sea, driuing vpon the water, which caused vs to iudge that wee were not far from the land.</P>
<P>The 21. day our Ʋice-Admirals boate came aboord vs, at which time happened an extreme storme of winde and rayne, so that wee were constrained to take in our top sailes: and because the storme continued long, it was thought good to take in the Ʋice-Admirals boate afore∣said, fearing least our boat should haue drawne her vn∣der water: wherfore we cast about to Lée-ward, to take in the boat, but in hoysing it ouer, the rope, which was fa∣stened before to the boat, brake, and therewith one of the quarter masters fell ouer boord, but we help him present∣ly and saued his life.</P>
<P>The 25. day in the night, about thrée houres before day-light, we had a shrewd gust of raine and wind, so
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
that we were glad to take in our sailes.</P>
<P>The 26. day in the morning wee could sée but 2. of our <NOTE PLACE="marg">15</NOTE> shippes, but in the euening we came againe together, and with our fore-sailes euery one of vs put loofe, fearing wee should come too néere the sholes, and the Moone was so barke, that we could hardly discerne the length of a ship from vs.</P>
<P>The 27. day in the morning wee put out againe all our satles to make more way, hauing a fine full gale from the West Northwest with faire weather, and at afternoone we saw an Island called the <HI>Isle de Gano,</HI> wherewith we were all greatly comforted and reioyced. The same night wee had a very hard tempest with contrary winds, which lasted two houres, and then the winde was againe good, and we shaped directly our course towards the maine land of <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>The 28. day in the morning wée sawe the mayne land <NOTE PLACE="marg">1598. The 28. Decem∣ber we saw the maine land of Sumatra</NOTE> of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which is a very high Countrey declining with a point towards the Strait.</P>
<P>All this day wee sayled for the most part East Southeast towards the shore.</P>
<P>In the euening wee spake with our Pinnase, and de∣maunded if they knew the place: and the Master answered vs that hee knew the place very well: wherewith wee left off to demaund any farther, but sayled forth Southeast and by East.</P>
<P>The 29. day in the morning wee had a shrewd gust of rayne and winde, with very darke weather. In the eue∣ning the Pinnase cast about to Lee-ward, and stayed for the shippes to speake with vs: whereupon wee tooke in our <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wee came in∣to the straight of Sun∣da.</NOTE> sayles, and ranne with our fore-course onely, to the end we might by daylight be before the strayts.</P>
<P>The 30. day in the morning beeing come into the Straites of <HI>Sunda,</HI> in the after-noone wee discryed fiue

small sayle vnder the shore, but they came not aboord vs, by reason that the wind was very great, &amp; blew a mightie storme: we layled along the shore, to wit, the coast of <HI>Iaua.</HI></P>
<P>The same day all the ships cléered all their ordinance, &amp; in the euening we cast our Ankers a good mile from <HI>Ban∣tam,</HI> néere vnto two small Islands, for we would not come before the towne in the night time.</P>
<P>The 31. day we wayed our Ankers, and sailed towards <NOTE PLACE="marg">We ar∣riued at Bantam.</NOTE> <HI>Bantam;</HI> in the way came a small boate of our other ships a∣boord vs, with foure mē, declaring vnto vs that our Admi∣rall, the <HI>Hollandia,</HI> and the smal Pinnase were at <HI>Bantam,</HI> almost fully laden, and that they had beene there a moneth and foure dayes: with which good newes we were all mar∣uailously reioyced, and in the afternoone we came into the roade with exceeding ioy, where our sayd other three ships lay, at which time were but fifteene of our men dead since our comming from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Presently came many of the Countrey people aboord vs, bringing vs Hennes, Egges, and many other sorts of fresh victuals &amp; fruits, which seemed very strange vnto vs.</P>
<P>The first day of Ianuarie many commodities were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ianuary.</NOTE> brought aboord vs to barter and trucke, as Hens, Egges, fruits, and such like.</P>
<P>The second &amp; third dayes, their Prawes or boats con∣tinued to come aboord vs so aboundantly with all kind of Marchandize, which they offered vs in truck, that we could hardly passe through them in our ships, some with Hens, some with <HI>Bonanas,</HI> &amp; some with garlicke, and other fruits.</P>
<P>The 4. day the Admirall came aboord all the ships, gi∣uing order to seperate the fléete, namely, that the 4. laden <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ships se∣uer thē-selues.</NOTE> ships should returne homewards, &amp; the other 4. should saile to the Islands of <HI>Moluccas:</HI> the Ʋice-Admirall in the ship called <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> was made Admirall, &amp; one of our Com∣mittees, <HI>Iacob Hemskerck</HI> Ʋice-Admirall, in the <HI>Gelder∣land,</HI>

<P>The fift, sixt, &amp; seuenth dayes, many Prawes or small boates continued to come aboord vs, offering vs fresh vic∣tualles in trucke.</P>
<P>The eight day in the euening we hoysed our sayles, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The 8. day of Ianuary the 4. ships de∣parted from Bantam towards the Is∣lands of Moluc∣cas.</NOTE> departed from <HI>Bantam</HI> with our foure ships, towards the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> to wit, the new Admirall, <HI>Wybrandt van War∣wicke,</HI> the Ʋice-Admirall, <HI>Iacob Hemskerck,</HI> the <HI>Zealand,</HI> whereof <HI>Iohn Cornelisson</HI> was master, and the <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> whereof <HI>Iohn Martssen</HI> was master or shipper.</P>
<P>The 11. day we ankered before a riuer lying betwéene <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Sakentra,</HI> and is about some foure leagues from <HI>Sakentra,</HI> two little Islands lying right ouer against it, and fiue other Islands right before you, about some halfe league from <HI>Sakentra.</HI></P>
<P>The 12. day we made prouision of water with all pos∣sible diligence, for two of our ships were appoynted to sayle before, to make prouision of fresh victualles: by noone wee had in all our water, and then wee and <HI>Melc∣knap</HI> sayled together away, and the next morning we cast our ankers before <HI>Sakentra,</HI> about a league from the land.</P>
<P>The 13. day in the morning, the <HI>Sambander</HI> or gouer∣nour came aboord vs with one of their Prawes, or little

boates, demaunding what wee came for, because wée rode in that place with our shippes. Our Ʋice-Admirall made answere, that wee came to buy fresh victuals: with which answere they were well pleased, saying there was inough of all things to bee had, and offered vs a present of a certaine fruit which they call <HI>Maugenus,</HI> which our Ʋice-Admirall receiued, remune rating him with a looking glasse, and a couple of drinking-glasses of small valewe. The afternoone following he departed again from whence he came, with two of our Committees, to make prouision of fresh victualles.

<P>The 22. day in the morning, two long boates were manned and sent to the shore, with two of the Ʋnder-Committées, to sée if they might there make any prouisi∣on of fresh victuals.</P>
<P>The same day in the euening, the long boats returned to the shippes, bringing with them a Portingall gentle∣man of the Countrey, which had renounced the Christi∣an religion, and taken vpon him the religion of the Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>This sayd <HI>Renegado</HI> spake with our Admirall, saying wee should at that place haue lading sufficient to our con∣tentment, if we would slay there thrée or foure moneths.</P>
<P>The 23. day in the morning, a long boate with thrée cocke-boats rowed againe to the shore, to buy Rice and o∣ther victuals. The same day in the euening, we saw ma∣ny people assembling in euery stréete with their weapons in very gallant comely sort after their manner, hauing very many Gentlemen among them on horse-backe, which could very well ride and mannage their horses, in running, Tourneis, breaking of lances, and hunting, which pastimes we sawe the same euening on their mar∣ket place.</P>

<HEAD>❧ A declaration of the maner of their Horses, and comely fashion vsed in decking and trimming them, together with their order in Turneys and running with their Launces, shewed vnto our Mar∣chants the 23. day of Ianuarie, to congratulate or wel∣come them, which was by those people accomplished very gallantly.</HEAD>
<P>THe Gentilitie of <HI>Tuban</HI> haue great delight &amp; plea∣sure <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Horses, &amp; howe they are trim∣med.</NOTE> in their Horses, for all such as are of any abili∣tie, wil kéepe a horse, wherin they take great pride. Their Horse are of a very small stature, their legs are small, but they run very swiftly, vsing rich &amp; costly Saddles made of Ʋeluet, and some of Spanish Leather, painted with grisly Dragons &amp; fearefull Diuels, for the most part gilded: the saddles are made like vnto ours, but with lower backs behind the seate. Their bridles are gar∣nished with precious stones, which are as white as Ala∣blaster: the bits are also made very fine &amp; costly, with 2. bosses of siluer, whereof some are white &amp; some gilded, ac∣cording to th'estate &amp; degrée of the master or owner of the horse: some of those bosses are made of copper also, for the meaner sort of people. They ride oftentimes out of the towne, 3. or 4 in a companie more or lesse, bragging, out∣facing, &amp; bearding each other as they ride, run, or turne their horses, striuing who can best run the ring, spring, leape, cariere, manage, force, and gouerne his horse, in the best and most gallant maner.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="23"/>
Their Speares or Launces are cōmonly of a very light wood, made round &amp; smal which they vse very finely &amp; cun∣ningly in all their Turnyes &amp; warlike exercises, chasing &amp; running after each other with such fury, as if they had to do with their enemies, or meant the matter in good earnest: when the one commeth néere vnto the other, the hindmost (which runneth after the other) declining or abasing his staffe, passeth forth before the other, then is he followed by him that was before the foremost, who setting spurs to his horse, &amp; giuing him the bridle, followeth as fast as his horse can run, vntil he bee before him, &amp; then the other followeth him again, bidding ech other the base in this sort, vntil their <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ma ner of running with their Launces on hors∣backe.</NOTE> horses bee wearyed. This their maner of war-like exer∣cise on horse backe, wee saw: there the 23. day of Ianuarie, 1599 accomplish to by many gallant Gentlemen in the Market place, to honour and welcome our Marchants, who were there present, made to the end we might sée their bra∣uerie &amp; cunning in riding, whereat the king himselfe was present on horsebacke, whose apparrell was a mantle or <HI>Pytgin</HI> of veluet, cast ouer his vnder-garment, &amp; a dagger hanging by his side with a golden haft, hauing thereon the picture of a Diuell. They had great changing of horses: for as soone as one horse was wearied, a fresh was presently brought, and the other led away: they shewed themselues very magnificent and stately in their riding, running, and chasing in this their war-like pastime.</P>
<P>At this place we found great plenty of fresh victuals, as <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fer∣tilitie of the Coun∣trey. 1599. 24. Ia∣nuarie.</NOTE> Oxen, Goates, Hennes, Egges, Fish, &amp; other fruits, as Co∣kar-nuts, Lemons, <HI>Bonanas, Maugas,</HI> &amp; many other sorts, very good &amp; holsome to be eaten: also wee bought very good Rice here at a reasonable price, so that we found this place very good and fit to make prouision of fresh victuals.</P>
<P>The sayd twenty fourth day in the night we hoysed our sayles, and departed thence with two of our ships, namely
<PB REF="24"/>
the <HI>Zealand</HI> and the Ʋice-Admirall, for the Admirall and the <HI>Vtrecht</HI> remained there at Anker, for they were to receiue of the King, Cattell and Rise, for certaine wares which the King had bought of them.</P>
<P>The 25. day at noonetide we sayled by <HI>Sydago,</HI> where <HI>Schellinger</HI> was murthered in the first voyage: we passed forward along the coast, vntill we came vnder the shore of <HI>Iaua,</HI> where we cast our ankers the same euening, (for we could not reach the corner or necke of the land, which stretcheth from <HI>Madura)</HI> where wee sent out our boat to sound the depth, but returned the next morning to the ships with small intelligence, by reason that there grew a great storme.</P>
<P>The 26. day, the Admirall and the <HI>Vtrecht</HI> came vnto vs, casting their Ankers vnder the land of <HI>Iaua</HI> and <HI>Madu∣ra:</HI> for the water is very shallow before the straight of <HI>Ma∣dura,</HI> insomuch that our Admiral sate al the night aground, not receiuing any hurt at all, for it was in that place a ve∣ry soft clay ground.</P>
<P>The 27. day in the morning, wee and <HI>Melcknap</HI> sayled <NOTE PLACE="marg">The 27 day wee ankered in the straights of Ma∣dura, by reason of great tem∣pests.</NOTE> thence, but the Admirall and the <HI>Vtrecht</HI> stayed behinde, for our Admirall durst not venter ouer the shallowes, but afterwardes they sayled thence to the East end of <HI>Madura,</HI> and anchored before a little towne called <HI>Arosby,</HI> to buy Rise and other fresh victualles.</P>
<P>The same day at noone wee cast our Ankers betweene <HI>Madura,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Iaua,</HI> to wit, in the straight of <HI>Madura,</HI> where a mightie streame runneth, so that wee were forced to stay for the Tyde: at afternoone wee sayled thence, and towards the euening let fall our Ankers before a little Towne called <HI>Iortan,</HI> where one of our Comittees went ashore with the long boate, to inquire for a Pilot, to bring vs vnto the Islands of <HI>Moluccas,</HI> but returned the same euening with a Lambe, which the King had bestowed
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
on our Ʋice-Admiral, not bringing any Pilot with them, which was the principall cause of our comming thither, for here at <HI>Iortan</HI> is the Roade, where all the shippes of <HI>Iaua lie.</HI></P>
<P>The 28. day in the morning, we sent a long boat to the shore to buy Rice and other necessaries, but they returned presently, bringing with them the <HI>Sabander,</HI> and in the afternoone the Kings brother came aboord vs, with a Pre∣sent, which he gaue to our Ʋice-Admiral.</P>
<P>The same day, some of our companie spake with a Dutchman that dwelled there in the Country, exercising great trade in Pepper, Nutmegs and Cloues.</P>
<P>The 29. day our long boate went ashore againe, and bought all prouision of fresh victuals.</P>
<P>The 30. day we sent againe to land to buy Rice, and to enquire after a Pilot, which wee found: the same night came a boate aboord vs with folke therein, shewing vs, that néere fortie of our men of the Admirals ship and of the <HI>Vtrecht</HI> were taken, and imprisoned in a very strong little Towne of the Countrey of <HI>Madura,</HI> called <HI>Aros∣bay.</HI></P>
<P>The 31. day, the before mentioned <HI>Renegado</HI> of Tu∣ban, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Tuban sendeth a pre∣sent to Graue Maurits.</NOTE> came to vs at <HI>Iortan,</HI> bringing from his King a ve∣ry faire present to be deliuered vnto his princely Excel∣lencie, which was a <HI>Kriis</HI> or dagger, and two speares or launces made after their maner, verie faire and costly: vpon the handle of the dagger was the kings owne coun∣terfeit or picture, made all of pure gold, and set with preci∣ous stones, worth 500. Gildernes, or 50. pound starling, and the blade of the dagger was indented and made after their fashion.</P>
<P>The first day of Februarie we arriued before <HI>Madura,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Februa∣rie.</NOTE> anchoring néere vnto our Admirall, hauing with vs the <HI>Renegado</HI> of <HI>Tubā</HI> aforesaid, who had promised to do his

best, to procure libertie to our imprisoned people, but found no good successe, by reason that the King demaunded so great a ransome for the prisoners, whereby wee were driuen to attempt by force to redéeme our people, which fell not out to our best contentment, notwithstanding I will bréefely relate the same vnto the courteous Reader.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A true declaration of our attempt in the Island of <HI>Madura,</HI> before a little Towne cal∣led Mosbay, done by vs for the releasement of our peo∣ple (by force of armes) that were there imprisoned, and of our ill successe in the said attempt. N o. 4.</HEAD>
<P>THe Island <HI>Madura</HI> lyeth on the North side of <HI>Iaua Maior,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The si∣tuation of the Is∣land of Madura.</NOTE> stretching out to the East end of <HI>Iaua;</HI> The Inhabitants are apparelled as the people of <HI>Iaua:</HI> they are very industrious, and painefull in all their actions. On the West end of <HI>Madura</HI> is situated a smal towne named <HI>Arosbay,</HI> strongly walled with gates and stages whereon they kéepe watch in the night, which are verie fit, and aptly placed to serue them at such times as they are visited by their enemies. But to come to our purpose, and speake of our attempt, we wil leaue to speak any further of the situation of <HI>Arosbay.</HI></P>
<P>Ianuarie 27. 1599. after wee had anchored vnder the land of <HI>Iaua,</HI> wee found a mighty shallow or banke, which stretcheth out euen vnto the mouth of the straight of <HI>Madura,</HI> &amp; so runneth forth to the land of <HI>Iaua.</HI> This banke in some places is but sixe fadome deep, and in other places déeper or shallower as it may fall out, by reason whereof we were constrained to part company (as before is partly declared) concluding among our selues, that the Ʋice-Admirall (which was the <HI>Geldria,</HI> with the other ship called the <HI>Zelandia)</HI> should saile to the straight of <HI>Ma∣dura,</HI> (lying betwéene the Island of <HI>Iaua</HI> and <HI>Madura)</HI> to
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
a little towne named <HI>Iortan,</HI> which is the place whereun∣to the <HI>Jauanars</HI> come with their ships, attending there for a faire wind to go to the Islands of <HI>Moluccas.</HI> At this place therfore we meant to take in a Pylot, to bring vs to the Islands of <HI>Moluccas:</HI> this was the onely reason that brought vs hither. In the meane while our Admirall and the <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> sailed to the West and of <HI>Madura,</HI> where they let fal their anchors before a small towne called <HI>Arosbay,</HI> &amp; sending their long boat to the said towne, to buy Ryse &amp; other victuals, the mariners were no sooner landed, but they were all apprehended, vnarmed, &amp; taken prisoners, the most part of them spoiled of their apparell, and other rags giuē them to couer their bodies. The Admiral séeing that the said boat stayed so long away, and returned not, sent a cocke-boat with thrée men to the shore, to know the cause why the other stayed so long frō the ships. These 3. men were no sooner come to the shore, but they were also taken prisoners by the inhabitants of the said towne, and carried to their fellowes. After that they were thus dealt with, y<SUP>e</SUP> commitees which were takē in this sort among the rest, obtained of the king licence to send 3. of their compa∣ny vnto their Admiral, to aduertise him of this imprison∣ment, conditionally, that the said 3. men should presently returne to the towne, after they had béene aboord their shipe: which was accordingly agréed and accomplished. After that the Admiral vnderstood of these proceedings, he sent a boat vnto the Ʋice-Admirall to aduertise him hereof. Who presently waying his anchors, droue downe the streame vntill he came before y<SUP>t</SUP> said towne <HI>Arosbay,</HI> where the mariners were imprisoned. Euery day letters were sent to &amp; fro, to come to some agréement for y<SUP>e</SUP> liberty of our people: but y<SUP>t</SUP> K. demanded a great ransom, namely y<SUP>e</SUP> 2. blacke péeces of ordinance which were in y<SUP>e</SUP> Admiral, some nūber of cloths, &amp; péeces of veluet, W<SUP>e</SUP> 1000. rials of 8
<PB REF="26"/>
This demand pleased the Admiral nothing at all, answe∣ring, that if they would content themselues with money or wares, hee would with all his heart agrée with them: but as touching the Ordinance by thē demanded, they be∣longed not vnto him, neither had he any power or autho∣ritie ouer them▪ for they belonged vnto his land, or state of whence hée was. This maner of parle continued in this sort fiue or sixe daies, and euery day their demands were more vnreasonable then other. In the end the Admirall called all the Marchants and masters aboord him, coun∣selling together what was best to bée done. Then they concluded to land some of their company, and with force of armes to deliuer the prisoners, (for wee were aduerti∣sed, that our men were kept in the long boate wherewith they went ashore, as yet lying in the hauen before the gate, without bonds, fetters, or close prison) meaning so∣dainly, and before they of the towne should be able to pre∣uent vs, to deliver our men: but we failed of our purpose.</P>
<P>The 5. day of Februarie, after we had very well and in good order with 150. men manned and armed thrée long boats, and thrée ship boates, we rowed to the shore, where wee found a great multitude of people before the towne, among whom were two Portingals, who came vnto vs with flags of peace or truce in their hands, say∣ing they would agrée with vs: which was nothing but deceit and knauerie, for they assembled themselues verie strongly within the towne. Whereupon some twentie of our Muskettiers leapt on land, discharging their muskets among the thickest, so that thrée or foure of them fell downe dead: and running towardes the place where the long boat lay with the prisoners, our Ʋice-Admirall cal∣led vnto vs to returne into our owne boat, and to bring her in néerer vnto the towne, which we did: in the meane while the townsmen were come out at another gate, mea∣ning
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
to enuiron vs, and so to enclose vs in the hauen, that we should not be able to returne. We perceiuing their in∣tent, sent presently two of our boats to the bome or barre, to kéepe the hauen frée for our returne: for if the enemie could haue possessed the corner, it would haue returned to our great hurt. While wee were thus in skirmish one with the other, they had cléered their brasse Bases, dis∣charging them very terribly among vs, they had also ma∣ny calieuers, and great store of Bowes and arrowes, wherewith they shot among vs, so that it séemed that ar∣rowes rained vpon vs: they thought as soone as our pow∣der was spent, to deale easily ynough with vs, but wée stayed not so long, by reason that the weather beganne to grow very tempestuous, the water was much falne, and besides we thought good no longer to hazard our liues in vaine, wherefore we retyred to our boats, and pulling vp the dregs, rowed out of the hauen towards our ships, for the wind began to rise more and more: and beeing some shot off from the land, the Admirals boat with 36 men, and the boat of the <HI>Zealand</HI> with 13. men, were with the waues &amp; billowes turned topsie-furuy and ouerthrowne: wee that were in the other boates were not able to helpe them, for it was as much as we were able to doe, to pre∣serue our owne boats aboue water, so that many a man came to his end by this mishap, some being drowned, and others killed by the wilde people on the shore, but some that hapned to swim to the one side of the towne, were sa∣ued by the <HI>Renegado</HI> of <HI>Tuban,</HI> which stoode by as the men came to land, and intreated for their liues, perswa∣ding the people to take them prisoners: whereupon they were suffered to come to the land: and knéeling on the ground, the people laid sand on their heads, in token that their liues were saued, but so many as swoome to the other side of the land, were put to the sword without mercie,
<PB REF="27"/>
Thus there died 25. of our mē, to wit, 15. of y<SUP>e</SUP> Admirals, one of <HI>Iohn Martssens</HI> ship, &amp; 9. of the <HI>Zealāds.</HI> The pri∣soners were the same euening led through the town, and kept without the gates in a countrey house. The Trum∣peter and the Corporall were bound and fettered, the rest were bound together, and three of them were shrewdly wounded, &amp; those which we meant to haue rescued, were carried to other places, separated in two companies.</P>
<P>The 6. day they were remoued from the place where <NOTE PLACE="marg">1599. the sixt of Fe∣bruarie.</NOTE> they were kept, and on the way met all together, except 6. which were led to another place, the rest were carried a mile into the Countrey, where they were put into a caue vnder the ground, and kept with a strong gard: here the Trumpeter and the Corporall were released of their bands and shackles.</P>
<P>The 7. day they were brought againe out of the den, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pri∣soners are brought out of the den, &amp; how it befell them af∣ter∣wards. The pri∣soners raniome made for 2000. ryals of eight.</NOTE> (the Trumpeter and the Corporall being led apart before the King) the said Corporall was by the king demanded if he would stay &amp; serue him, promising to bestow on him 2. of his wiues, &amp; many other rewards. Whereunto the Corporall answered, his desire was rather to liue with his fellowes aboord the shippe, hoping that his Captaine would find means for his release, if it were possible. Thē were they led againe to their companion prisoners, and in the gate of the towne they met the rest of their com∣pany, being then 51. in number all prisoners: from whence they were led al together to a little Islandlying on the towne-ditch, hard by the towne, where they were night and day garded with a strong watch.</P>
<P>The eight day we beganne againe to parle about the prisoners ransome: and in the end it was agréed to pay 2000. péeces of Rials of eight, in spice or in wares at the Kings pleasure.</P>
<P>The 9. day eight of the Prisoners were sent aboord,
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
and their ransome carried a shore.</P>
<P>The 10. day were 12. deliuered, and their ransome sent to the King, and this continued the 11. and 12. vnto the 13. day, vntill all the prisoners were released.</P>
<P>The 14. day wee had all our folke aboord, two except, whereof one was taken with the rest. the other had in the night hid himselfe, which two willingly remained behind, greatly to the disliking of our Admirall.</P>
<P>The same day the <HI>Vtrecht</HI> discharged three peeces of Ordinance, for ioy that our people were deliuered, and hauing hoysed our sayles, departed thence, and the same euening came to the other shippe: and sayling together in company, wee shaped our course East and by North, a∣long the coast of <HI>Madura,</HI> hauing the wind West South-west, at which time (our ships being vnder saile) our Master <HI>Iacob Martssen</HI> dyed.</P>

The people thereof liue most by théeuerie and spoyle of others, taking with their smal boats or prawes, all they can get at Sea, as wel from their neighbours, as

from strangers, and yet their neighbours so robbed and daily spoyled by them, dare not reuenge themselues, for feare lest they should shut vp the passages, and not suf∣fer any thing to bee transported out of their Countrey, whereby they should want meanes of sustentation and food: neither is it an easie matter to hurt them, for that no shipping can come neere them.</P>
<P>Touching their weapons and vse thereof, they are like vnto the same of <HI>Iaua,</HI> as well for Elephants, Hor∣ses, Pikes, Launces, and Targets: and besides, they haue the vse of Curtelares and Daggers, with the Diuels picture on them.

<P>The 17. and 18. dayes we had sight of the Island <HI>Ce∣lebes,</HI> kéeping our course East, and East and by North.</P>

Bases, all which they discharged to honour and wel∣come vs: wee discharged also all our Ordinance, to con∣gratulate and answere their courtesie, and then let fall our Ankers, kéeping good watch all the night, for we vn∣derstood that they kept a watch all night on the shore, which wée might easily discerne.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Admirall came aboord vs, demaun∣ding to what end we came thither, and what we desired. Whereunto was answered, that we came in trade of Marchandize, &amp; to that end had brought with vs all sorts of Marchandize: with which answere he seemed to vs to be glad, willing vs to come aland, where he would agree with vs. The next day the Ʋice-Admirall went ashore to accord &amp; conclude some great bargaine, where he was in very friendly sort welcommed and receiued, bringing him into a Tent made of their sailes vnder a trée, where they conferred with each other about trade and full la∣ding of our ships.</P>

<P>THe Gentle Reader may please to vnderstand, that the foure shippes (namely the <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> the <HI>Zealand,</HI> and the <HI>Gelderland,</HI> arriued the third day of March before <HI>Amboyna,</HI> where, perceiuing that they should not find sufficient lading for all the foure ships, af∣ter consultation had, it was determined to separate the ships, &amp; to send 2. of them to <HI>Banda,</HI> namely the <HI>Zealand,</HI> whereof <HI>Iohn Cornelissen</HI> was Master, &amp; the <HI>Gelder∣land,</HI> whereof <HI>Iohn Bruiin</HI> was Master. The ele∣uenth day of March therefore, these sayd two Shippes sette sayle from <HI>Amboyna,</HI> leauing the other two Shippes behinde them, the which remayned there

two moneths after: where leauing them, we will proceede with the nauigation of the other two towards <HI>Banda,</HI> de∣claring vnto you the rich and speedie lading which they there found, and afterwards returne to speake of the na∣uigation of those other two, to wit, of the <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> whereof <HI>Claes Ianssen Melknap</HI> was master, and of the <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> whereof <HI>Iohn Martssen</HI> was Master, who al∣so departed from <HI>Amboyna</HI> the 8. day of May toward the Islands of <HI>Moluccas.</HI> Thus much I thought good to note vnto the fauorable Reader, that hee might the better reade and vnderstand the order, and whole discourse of this Voyage made by the 8. shippes, which sayled from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> the 13. day of March 1598. to the East <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<P>THe 11. day of March at afternoone we parted from <NOTE PLACE="marg">1599.

<P>The 12. day in the morning, the <HI>Zealand</HI> with our <NOTE PLACE="marg">1599. March. 12.</NOTE> shippe the <HI>Gelderland,</HI> set sayle together, but for that it was calme weather, wee could not make any way.</P>
<P>The 13. day about noone the <HI>Zealand</HI> came aground in the straight of <HI>Ceru,</HI> néere an Island called <HI>Ielau,</HI> where a mightie currant runneth, and the weather very calme, so that the streame droue her vpon the banke, which lyeth before this little Island: but God
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
blessed her, sending a fine gale, whereby she presently got out an Anker, and so wound her off. Thus with great ioy and comfort we sayled foorth together.

<P>The. 14. day very calme, with a fine gale towards the euening from the north-west, we holding our course south∣east towards <HI>Banda:</HI> The same euening we had sight of the Iland <HI>Banda,</HI> lying from vs south-east. In the night time we came by an Iland called <HI>Loel Setton,</HI> lying on the North-west end of <HI>Banda</HI> about some 5. Leages. This little Iland is not inhabited, neither dare any man <NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange tale, if it be true.</NOTE> presume to come into it (as our Pylot reported, that was in our Ship.) The people are wonderfully afeard thereof: for they are of opinion, that it is the habitation of Sathan, in so much that when they approach neare vnto this Iland with their shipping, they know not how to make haste enough to passe from or by it: which we might easely per∣ceiue by our Pylot, who tooke a Boate-hooke in his hand, placing himselfe before in y<SUP>e</SUP> Ship, where he stood drawing and pulling the hooke towardes him, imagining that there∣by we should the sooner leaue the land behind vs: but after he was wearie with pulling, he laide the hooke before ouer the Shippes side, not suffering vs to take the hooke away before we were passed this little Iland: and when it was a little calme &amp; still weather, this prettie fellow went whist∣ling with his mouth vp and downe the Ship, meaning therewith to call and intice the Diuell: whereby we saw that these people were very weake of beliefe.</P>
<P>The 15. day we saw two Ilands more, lying South∣west of <HI>Banda</HI> some leage and a halfe: the one is called
<PB REF="33"/>
<HI>Polleway,</HI> and the other <HI>Polleruyn,</HI> which lie some halfe a league distant from each other. At Noone came aboard vs one of the <HI>Praus</HI> full of people, from the Iland <HI>Polle∣ruyn:</HI> they are very nimble and lusty men: they were ap∣parrelled with a garment made of Cotton cloth: their weapons were Pikes, which they throw with their hands.

Por∣tingale Ships laden there, and that it was three Moneths since they departed thence: and they brought with them great plenty of Nutmegs, Maces, &amp; Cloues: and said there was lading plenty to fraight our Ships.</P>
<P>The 16. day about noone, the <HI>Sabander</HI> came abord to speake with the Ʋice-Admiral, at which instant <HI>Melcknap</HI> let fall his Anker by vs, at 14. fadome sandie ground.</P>
<P>The. 17. day an other <HI>Sabander</HI> came aboard vs from a little Towne called <HI>Ortattan:</HI> we offered to bestow on him a present, but he refused it, saying he would the next day come againe aboard vs.</P>

<P>The. 25. day the Ʋice Admirall sayled to the other side <NOTE PLACE="marg">We began to buy and sell.</NOTE> of the Iland, meaning there to hire an house, because more resort of people was on that side then els where: for there all the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auaners</HI> dwell, which bring yearly Mar∣chandize thither, and are great dealers.</P>

<P>The. 4. day we receiued letters from our Admirall ly∣ing before <HI>Amboyna,</HI> aduertising vs that there was little lading to be had there, by reason that the Inhabitants had great wars with the <HI>Portingals,</HI> who finding themselues grieued with our being there, sought to haue our trade for∣bidden at that place, &amp; that our people should not there come a shore: for the <HI>Portingals</HI> had a little Castle on the west side of <HI>Amboyna,</HI> wherewith they greatly annoyed the people of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The. 5. day they of <HI>Nera</HI> tooke our waights from vs, forbidding vs to vse our trade any longer, vntil we had a∣greed with the Gentlemen, for they sought &amp; demaunded to haue some beneuolence or reward bestow vpon them, wherupon we shut vp our doores.</P>

<P>The. 8. day we laboured on all hands to discharge and land our commodities.</P>
<P>The. 14. day we sent our long Boate manned with 14. men to <HI>Amboyna,</HI> to vnderstand how all thinges went with our Admirall.</P>
<P>The 26. day the said long Boat returned from our Ad∣mirall, declaring that he had not aboard the Ship aboue 5. Last of Cloues: but that he hoped very shortly to haue more.</P>
<P>The. 28. and. 29. dayes, we were very busie on shore in buying and selling, and we began as well as our o∣ther Ship did, to buy of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auaners,</HI> Maces, Nut∣megs, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The price of Nutmegs Cloues and Mace.</NOTE> and Cloues: we bought the Baer of Mace for 60. peeces of Ryalls of eight, the Baer of Cloues for 45.

From the first to the last day of May, we continued <NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> these affaires, dayly sending aboard and lading our Ships.</P>
<P>The. 8. day a great mightie Snake of II. foote long came creeping in at the hance of the <HI>Zealand:</HI> which the company killed and did eate.</P>
<P>The. 5. of Iune they of <HI>Labbetacken</HI> came with foure <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune.</NOTE> Galleyes before <HI>Nera,</HI> skirmishing with the inhabitants of the said towne of <HI>Nera,</HI> where some men were slaine and many hurt. Nowbeit that these two townes lie so neare together, that a man may go betweene them in an houre space, or there abouts: they are mortall enemies to each other, not sparing one the other vpon any oppor∣tunitie or aduantage that they can take, keeping very strong watch in the woods, and on the shores, where they waite for their enemies. They vse shields about some foure foote long, with verie heauie Sables or Curtelaxes, the haftes or handels whereof are couered with tinne, and are very cunning and expert in the vse of them. They haue some Calyuers and Baesses of brasse, which they vse in their Galleyes, and for defence of their townes: when they go into the field against their enemies, euery man carrieth with him two Dartes, or Iauellings, made of ve∣ry hard wood, some fadome and a halfe long: in casting whereof they are so perfect and exact as may be, yea, they throw them with such force, that they slay their enemies therewith: and hauing spent their dartes, they draw their Sables: wherwith, and with their shields, they stoutly incounter each other <HI>pel mel.</HI> They haue also Caliuers as is aforesaid, but not many. They make great account of Salads and head peeces: for if they get one of them on their heads, they thinke themselues well defended from all perrills.</P>

The people being at warres continually among them selues are seuered into three factions: the chiefe Towne whereof, is called <HI>Nera.</HI></P>
<P>Among all the Ilandes of <HI>Moluccas,</HI> this Iland yeel∣deth the greatest quantitie of Nutmegges, insomuch that the people of <HI>I aua, Malacca, China,</HI> and many other neighbouring Ilandes, doe heere vse and exercise verie large trade in buying and selling, bringing hyther their goodes and marchandizes from all places: where, after they haue stayed two or three monthes, and made sale in barter, or otherwise, they returne home in their shypping: vsing at their first comming, to buy a Woman to do their businesse, and dresse their victualles: but when they haue finished their affaires, and are ready to depart thence, they cast off the sayd Woman to goe where she will, vntill the next yeere, that they come thither againe.</P>
<P>The most part of the Inhabitants are commonly Hea∣thens, of <HI>Mahomets</HI> religion or beliefe, wherin they haue so great deuotion, that they will not go the watch, or re∣turne from it, before they haue made and poured out their
<PB REF="36"/>
praiers &amp; orizons in their Temples, which in their speach they call <HI>Musquita,</HI> alwayes washing their feete before they enter into their said <HI>Musquitas,</HI> (for commonly they haue great pots filled with water before their said <HI>Mus∣quitas)</HI> wherewith they clense &amp; wash them selues: which done, they go into y<SUP>e</SUP> Church or temple, where pouring out their prayers with cryings &amp; howlinges, yea so lowd, that a man may heare them verie easely aboue 20. houses from their <HI>Musquitas,</HI> pronouncing these wordes for the most part two or three times: <HI>Stofferolla, Stofferolla, Ascehad an la, Ascehad an la, Yll la, Ascehad an la, Yll lol la, Yll lol la, Machumed die rossulla.</HI> And as they pronounce the last word, they strike their face with their hand: in which cer∣rimonie, they haue great deuotion. They vse also other prayers, which they vtter not with voyce, but mumble them and iumble them softly to themselues in a very strange manner: such prayers ended, and hauing spread a matte on the earth, they stand thereon, casting their eyes twise or thrice vp toward the heauens, and then fal∣ling on their knees, they lay their heads three or foure times on the ground. This ceremonie they vse often, both in their <HI>Musquitas,</HI> in their houses, &amp; also openly abroad.</P>
<P>The Inhabitantes meete often times together in their <HI>Musquitas,</HI> bringing their victuals with them: where they make good cheere, and feast one another. They vse the like feastinges often times in the Woodes, assembling sometimes 100. persons in a companie, to make good cheere, and to be merrie togither: of such assemblies they make great accompt, taking great delight, pleasure, and contentment therein: and commonly such meetinges are vsed, when they will conferre together of common wealth matters, and such like, of some waight or moment.</P>
<P>They make sharpe warres one against an other, yea the townes lying scant a mile or leage distant frō each other,
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
are deuided. This enimitie hath continued long &amp; many yeeres in this Iland, for that they of <HI>Lambetack</HI> (a towne situated some litle leage frō <HI>Nera,</HI> the principallest towne of the whole Iland) heretofore cut downe, or ouerthrew certaine trees within the circut or liberties of <HI>Nera:</HI> from hence I say, such mortall hate, and bloodie warres hath so long since taken such deepe roote in the hartes of those people, that neuer since they could be reconciled, but with∣out all mercie, or sparing one another, or keeping of any quarter, vpon all aduantages &amp; stratagems, they murther and kill one an other like Dogs, as wee in the time of our beeing there, haue often and sundry times seene. In the night they keepe very strong watch as well in the woods, as within their townes, calling &amp; crying one to an other all the night long, to thend they should not fall a sleepe.</P>
<P>Now when they meane to make any attempt, or to take any enterprise in hand, commonly they come with their Gallies, which they row so swistly as a Shippe can sayle with a reasonable gale of winde. These Gallies do great seruice: neither are they altogether ignorant in the vse of their Baesses, whereof euery Gallie hath two of brasse.</P>
<P>They vse also Hand-gunnes, or Caleeuers, in their warres, with sundry other instruments and weapons, as Sheeldes, with a great Sable, called in their language <HI>Padaug,</HI> which they handle and vse in very good sort, tea∣ching their children while they are young, to fight &amp; play at fence. They haue also Pikes commonly in their wars, made of very hard wood, which they cast very certainely and neare, as we our selues haue often times seene. They haue also an other kind of weapon most common &amp; vsuall among them, the end is of Iron, made like vnto a small harping-yron, wherein they put a sticke, fastning thervnto a little thinne coard, which they throw into the bodyes of their enemies when they come neare togither, and draw
<PB REF="37"/>
it to them againe with the string: when they go against their enemies, they set a murrion or head piece vpon their head, whereof they haue good store among them, wearing in them commonly a Parradice bird in stead of a feather, thinking themselues sure and safe enough when they haue such an helmet on their head. Some of the Gentlemen haue Corslets or harnesse, wherein they thinke they can take no hurt of their enemies.</P>
<P>Now when they enterprise any attempt with their Gallies, they make a most hideous noyse with crying, calling, hooping, hallowing, playing on Drums, and Bason, as if they were all out of their wittes: the Gen∣tlemen (standing aloft in the Gallie with their weapons in their hands) make many crooked leapes, springing this way &amp; that way: he which can spring best, thinkes himselfe the trimmest fellow, and is not a little proud thereof. On the sides of the Gallies are stages of Canes, made to passe euen with the water, whereon the slaues sit to row, or ra∣ther skoope &amp; shouell the water, for in stead of Oares they vse shouels made of wood, 2. or 3. sitting together, shouell vp the water, &amp; casting the shouel ouer their heads, poure out the water ouer the side of the Gallie: in doing where∣of, they make a wonderfull noyse with singing, after their manner: others sitting by them, which play vpon Drums, &amp; somtimes vpon Basons also. They are very subtill and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The dispo∣sition &amp; in∣clination of the people.</NOTE> stout men in their warres, seeking and visiting their ene∣mies with great courage and assurance, as we saw our selues at what time they of <HI>Labbetacke</HI> came with foure Gallies before <HI>Nera,</HI> euen right before our lodging, offer∣ing skirmish most brauely to each other on the land, wher∣in some were slaine &amp; some hurt.

watch that night in <HI>Labbetacke</HI> (for they are confederats, &amp; hold with those of <HI>Labbetacke)</HI> where they put to the sword most of the people that were in the said Iland, bring∣ing their heads from thence with them to <HI>Nera,</HI> fastened one by another to a rope, for their greater glory &amp; triumph, which they hold with all their pompe of flags, streamers, banners, pennons, &amp; banderels, shooting very lustily with their Baesses that lay in their Gallies. They also brought with them a woman prisoner, which the <HI>Sabander</HI> of the Iland kept for his slaue. They also brought an other wo∣man with them, but they cut her in the midle in two pee∣ces with a Sable or Curtlar, in so much that they liued most beastly with the people, whereby we might see that they were a most bloody &amp; tyranicall nation. But not con∣tented that they had thus butcherly prayed vpon their neighbours, and murthered them, 5. or 6. dayes after in despight of their enemies, they went vp &amp; downe the streets bragging, with their weapons yet red with the blood of their enemies, for in such bloody actions they take a mer∣uelous pride, especially that they had so well effected this bloody stratagem: yet not withstanding this their mortal hatred, they buried the heads of their slayne enemies very honourably, the order whereof was thus. After that they were with their Gallies returned, the heads being orderly placed on a staffe, fastened thereunto (as before is said) with a rope, they are brought before the house of the <HI>Sa∣bander</HI> or Gouernour, and laid vpon a great stone vnder a Tree, to the view of all the people, that they might see how valiantly they had behaued themselues against their common enemies: whence (after they had so lien the space of an houre) they were taken, and wrapped in Calli∣cute, or cloth made of Cotton, and laid in a platter, &amp; so carried to the place of buriall: &amp; being put into the earth, they burnt great store of franckensence ouer the graues,

according to the manner and custome of the Countrey.</P>
<P>Furthermore, when a man dyeth, the women that are <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ce∣remonies vsed ouer the dead.</NOTE> alyed in friendship or kinred, weeping and lamenting, call and cry to the dead corps very loude, thinking with such calling and mourning that the Course shall againe receiue life: but seeing that it remayneth dead, without mourning they prepare are a great Banquet, inuiting all their friendes, and such as accompaned the dead corps to the fu∣nerall, which is carried vpon mens shoulders, in such sort as is commonly vsed in our Countrey, but that they lay a white peece of Callikute ouer the dead: then is the corps followed to the Graue first by the men, and the women after: the dead being layd into the earth, they burne Fran∣kensence one whole day and night thereouer, put into a vessel for that purpose: and vnder a penthouse, or such like, which is made ouer the graue, burneth a Lampe al night▪ the next day in the morning after the buriall, come thither all the common people, Gentlemen, and others, making their prayers ouer the Graue: which maner of ceremonie they keepe and obserue for many dayes. These things we saw and behelde with our eyes, and demaunded of them why they vsed such kind of ceremonies: They answered interogatiuely, demaunding of vs if we did not the like when any died in our Countrey. We demaunded further, what they prayed ouer the dead▪ Their answere was, that the dead might not rise againe: which they steadfastly be∣leeue, supposing that if they should not so pray ouer the Graue of the dead, he would againe reuiue: such is their lamentable misbeliefe.

There groweth no Rice, neither any kinde of graine to make bread, but they make the same of trées, which being cut downe and clouen, they take an hammer made of a thicke réede, wherewith they beate the same clouen wood, which yéeldeth a certaine dust, like vnto sawe-dust (which they call in their language <HI>Sagge)</HI> where of they make their bread, which is very white, and the loues foure square, of the breadth or bignes of the palme of a mans hand, wherewith they vse their princi∣pall trade, for whatsoeuer they buye or sell, is all with this bread. There are plentie of Coquars, and Bonanas trées, with some Lemon and Orange trées, but meruei∣lous quantitie of Cloues, so thàt it is very poore and scant of victuals. The people are kinde and good of nature, but of beggerly condition, euen the King himselfe and all his gentlemen, as well as the common sorte: neuerthelesse, they hate théeuerie, in so much that not a théefe can there

escape the rope. It happened while we were there, that a boy of 11. or 12. yeares olde had stolen a leafe or two of Tabaco, wherewith he was taken, and led thorow the streetes with his hands bound behinde him, after whom followed all the boyes of the towne mocking him, and crying in their language a théefe, a théefe. They are great enemies of the Portingals, for right ouer against this Island, lieth another Island called <HI>Tydore,</HI> planted with Portingals, they holde no quarter with each other, but kill one another like dogs, as it happened at our be∣ing there, the 20. day of Iulie, 1599. at what time they of <HI>Ternate</HI> went out to the Island <HI>Tidore,</HI> where they on a sudden set vpon a village, slew thrée of the inhabitance, and brought away 43. prisoners: among whom was a young man of 21. yeares olde, sonne to the King of <HI>Ty∣dores</HI> brother, who (after he had béen brought to the Kings presence, and some spéeches vsed betwéene them) was lead out of the pallace with a rope about his necke vnto the sea side, where hée was commaunded to wash his hands: the young man stooping so to doe, one that stoode bebinde him, smote him on the backe with his Sable that he fell to the grounde, and presently another man lent him another blowe, wherewith his lyuer and lungs hung out of his bodie. Hauing in this dispitefull sorte shewed their merciles hearts, the bodie was towed into the sea, at the sterne of a Praw or small boate, and so suffered to driue away. Their chiefe weapons are pikes of réedes, which they cast at their enemies with their hands mer∣ueilous right and stronglie: they vse also great broade swordes and long shieldes, which séeme to be made of some boorde, foure foote long. Some of them vse Muskets and hand-guns, but in very small number, for of them∣selues they haue none, but such as they get from the Por∣tugales. At such times as the Sunne or Moone are eclip∣sed,
<PB REF="52"/>
they make great sorrowe and lamentation, supposing that their King (or some other of their chiefe men) shall dye (as we our selues sawe the sixt of August, about eyght of the clocke in the euening, the Moone then being eclypsed) the people kept such a howling, praying, crying, and mourning in most hideous wise, with smiting vpon drummes and copper pans, as was most straunge to be∣holde. Wherefore we demaunded of them the cause why they cried and mourned in such sorte, they answered vs, that the Moone was eclipsed, and that therefore their King, or some of his blood should dye. The eclipse passed, and séeing that the King nor any of his blood is dead, they make great ioy: and the next day holde as it were a pro∣cession: those that goe formost carrie in their hands Purcelane dishes, followed with others bearing Pikes, Halberds, Muskets and Gunnes, after whom thrée Lampes are carried, made after the manner as they painte in our countrie a bunsh of grapes of the land of Promise, then followeth a boye appareled in kingly ap∣parell, before whom is borne a gilded fanne, then follow many women, as well young as olde finely decked after their manner: all this is done for ioy that no man is dead. Wée tolde them that there were men in our countrey, that knowe, and can tell long before when any eclipse shall be of the Sunne or Moone, which they thought to be impossible, and wondered thereat, as if it were a myracle.</P>

<P>The 30. day, we had sight of the Isle of <HI>Oba,</HI> sayling to the Northwarde thereof, the same is a very great Island.</P>

<P>The 12. day, we let fall our anchors againe vnder the same Island, by reason that <HI>Iohn Martsson</HI> sayled from our companie, to séeke way betwéene the Islands, but the next day came againe to vs, for the Admirall discharged a péece to the ende he should returne.</P>
<P>The 13. day, <HI>Iohn Martsson</HI> returned to vs, and then we sayled thence together, but towards noone we cast out our anchors againe, for that <HI>Iohn Martsson</HI> could not kéepe vs companie, by reason of a great tempest that then blew, but towards the euening he came to vs, and then sayled thence together, but could not goe farre, by reason of the shoels, wherefore we cast out our anchors againe, and rode at 9. 10. 12. and 15. fathome.</P>

<P>The 16. daye, we sayled thence towards the Islands <NOTE PLACE="marg">The 16. day, we were com∣passed with Islands.</NOTE> from whence we came, at afternoone we let fall our an∣chors againe, and within an houre after set sayle againe, and in the euening cast out our anchors againe, then some of our Saylers went vp to the maine top Mast, from whence they discried, and tolde some thirtie Islands lying round about vs, within the compasse of fouretéene or fif∣téene leagues, but by no meanes wée could get out of them.</P>
<P>The 17. day in the morning, we hoysed vp sayles a∣gaine with a South Southeast wind, shaping our course South Southwest, and Southwest and by South to sea∣wards, whereby (with Gods helpe and prouidence) wée got cléere of the Islands, sayling thorow a very narrow channell or gappe, leauing the necke of the land that lay out, on our star boorde side, where we found a little nar∣rowe place to get out, for on our larboorde lay thrée little Islands, where many shoels were to the southward, and as farre as we could discerne, we might sée a fyre, and at afternoone we saw another great fyre in the open Seaes some foure leagues from land, which we left on our star∣boord, hauing a very fine gale of winde.</P>
<P>The 18. daye in the morning, wée sawe againe high

<P>The 22. day, we came néere to this aforesaid land, meaning to sayle about that way to the Eastward, but for want of winde could not: in conclusion, we agréed to shape our course along the coast Eastward, and to goe a∣bout to the Westward, and so put forth our foresailes.</P>
<P>The 23. day, <HI>Iohn Martsson</HI> discharged a péece, being very néere aground, hauing but two fathome and a halfe water, and was faine to towe the ship with their boate from the shoels (the weather being very cléere and faire, as God would) and afterward came aboord vs, declaring that he had séene sixe boates, but not spoken with any of them, neither could he learne what Island that the same was, our Pylots supposed it to be <HI>Boere.</HI></P>
<P>The same night <HI>Iohn Martsson</HI> came agrounde, but wound himselfe off with a bowe anchor, but lost a planke of his ship, some fathome and an halfe long, howbeit, the ship (God be praysed) remained tight, it was an vncer∣taine or vnéeuen ground: for hauing cast his leade, and finding 40. fathome, before they could cast out the leade againe, the ship sat fast aground, but being now off, we ran East Southeast of that place.</P>

<P>The same night <HI>Iohn Martsson</HI> droue a ground on the East ende of the said Island, the weather being very calme, the ship sate before aground, hauing behind twen∣tie fathome water, whereupon they cast out their bowe anchor behinde at the gallerie, and so in winding her off, she swayed to the sholeward, but wound her off againe with the Capsten, and pulling vp their anchor, they found the same to be broken, for the shanke was in two peeces, but they got them vp into their ship, by reason that the Buy rope was twisted about the Cable.</P>
<P>The 2. 3. and 4. dayes we lay at hull, about some two degrees Southward of the Lyne, by reason of extreame winde, and tempestious weather, the Sunne being for the most part ouer our heads.</P>

<P>The 13. day, we came before <HI>Saketra,</HI> where we made some prouision of Rice, and were (God be thanked) deli∣uered of our former penurie and hunger: héere we heard that the Ʋizadmirall was departed from <HI>Bantam,</HI> about thrée moneths past.</P>
<P>The 16. day, we sayled from <HI>Saketra,</HI> anchoring the same day before the fresh Ryuer, where we furnished our selues with water, the Chinans brought vnto vs Aracca and Rice in most plentifull sorte, which we bought for some fiue pence the pound.</P>
<P>The 17. day, wee sayled thence towards <HI>Bantam,</HI> where two Dutch ships lay. The 18. day we spoke with them, they were the Long barke, and the Sunne, which had lyne eyght moneths and tenne dayes before <HI>Bantam,</HI> (and were departed from thence in the night time, not re∣freshing themselues) where they had so néerely bartered all; that in the ende (for want of money) they trucked
<PB REF="59"/>
also the whistles from about their neckes, and yet had not effected any great matter, for both the ships had but 60. last of Pepper and Cloues together, and farther were weakened 55. men.</P>
<P>The 19. day wée arriued before <HI>Bantam,</HI> where wée <NOTE PLACE="marg">We arriued before Ban∣tam. The price of Pepper, Ma∣ces, &amp; Cloues.</NOTE> were much made of: <HI>Iohn Martsson</HI> hauing taken in his first Pepper but the fifth of this moneth, and bought the same by the bagge, euery bagge waying fiftie pounde, for the which they paide foure péeces of Ryals of 8. and an halfe, but at the last foure Ryals of 8. for a bag. The Maces and Cloues are bought by the Baer, waying 500 pound, the Maces for 80. and the Cloues for 65. péeces of Ryals of 8.</P>
<P>The 15. of Ianuarie 1600, our Admirall went a shore to the Magistrates of <HI>Bantam,</HI> bestowing on them sundrie presents and giftes, and dealt with them about farther trade, wherein they agréed very well, with thankes and due salutations on both parts, which done, he tooke his leaue after he had giuen the boate vnto the Gouerner of <HI>Bantam,</HI> wherein he came ashore, hanged with Skarlet cloth, and appoynted with two murthe∣ring péeces, but those people haue small knowledge how to vse the same.</P>
<P>The 20. day we brought all our Marchants aboorde, hauing almost solde all their wares.</P>
<P>The 21. daye, one of our Marchants went againe ashore, with a small parcell of Ʋeluet, and returned <NOTE PLACE="marg">Veluet.</NOTE> with twentie bagges of Pepper, made of the sayde Ʋeluet.</P>

<HEAD>The discription of <HI>Bantam.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE manners and policie vsed in <HI>Ban∣tam</HI> are very strange, for when a man dyeth, leauing behinde him any goods, whether he haue children or none, the King seazeth vpon the widow, chil∣dren, and goods, appropriating all to himselfe: making the Mother his slaue: and if a man of <HI>China</HI> desire to buye the Mother or daughter, he selleth them, and if afterwards they chance to haue children betwéene them, it happeneth to her a∣gaine as it did after her first husbands death, if the King doe vnderstand of any goods left by the deceased: such as haue any wealth, haue no other meanes to preuent this mischiefe, but onely to marrie their children while they are young, whereby they may inherite their Parents goods: wherefore they are married when they are but twelue or thirtéene yeares of age and younger, if they be of very rich Parents: and (which is more strange) some∣times such rich children haue two or thrée Wiues, accor∣ding as they abounde in wealth, and this is done to pre∣uent the King of the possessions of their goods after they are dead.</P>
<P>In their trade and traffike, they are meruailous thée∣uish, both the people of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>lava,</HI> in so much that they let not to helpe themselues with false waights, fal∣sefying and mingling their Pepper with blacke sand and small stones, to make it weigh heauie: they are also false

of their word or promise, and giuen to man-slaughter: for if it so chaunce that two fight, and the one killeth the o∣ther, he which liueth (knowing that he must dye) will stab and kill euery one where he can or may, sparing net∣ther man, woman, nor childe, no not the children sucking the Mothers breast, so long vntill he be ouercome by force and multitude of people: then is he brought before the Gouernour, who pronounceth sentence vpon him, and after such iudgement giuen, hee is thrust into the breast with a dagger, that he falleth to the ground: but it chaunceth seldome that such an one is apprehended alsue, for commonly they are slaine before they be taken.</P>
<P>The 21. day of Ianuarie, we set sayle from <HI>Bantam</HI> to∣wards <HI>Holland,</HI> but at afternoone we lay still by reason of the calme, yet towards the euening we hoysed vp our sayles againe.</P>
<P>The 26. day, we were put to our allowance, to wit, euery day sixe Mutskins of Atack, at which time we were not passed the Islands of <HI>Iava.</HI></P>
<P>The 28. day, we were in the height of 8. degrées, the euening still and calme, the wind Westerlie.</P>
<P>The 3. day of Februarie, we had the winde at South∣west, so that we sayled Southeast, and South Southeast with a fine gale.</P>
<P>The 4. day of Februarie we were in the height of 10. degrées, and could not sayle higher then South and by East, and South Southeast, with a reasonable gale, the winde being Westerlie.</P>
<P>The 12. day, our chiefe Barber (master <HI>Christopher</HI> an Easterling) dyed.</P>
<P>The 14. day, the Sunne passed ouer our heads in the height of 13. degrées and 12. minutes.</P>

<P><PB N="56" REF="60"/>
The 26. day we were in the height of 19. degrées with a fine gale, shaping our course for the most part West Southwest with a full gale.</P>
<P>The 27. day a flying fish flew into the <HI>Amsterdam</HI> at the hause.</P>
<P>The 3. day of March we were in the height of 23. de∣grées 50. minutes, we sailed with a forewinde according to our hearts desire.</P>
<P>The 16. day we were in the height of 35. degrées, hol∣ding our course West and by North.</P>
<P>The 18. day was a Mutskin of Aracks bestowed on the most of the chiefe officers, to the number of sixtéene persons, after the second watch according to the Admi∣rals direction, the winde being then Northerly, so that we could not saile neerer than West Northwest.</P>
<P>The 19. day the common Marriners made request to haue one Mutskin of Arack in the night, as the officers had, which was denied, except they would content them∣selues with one lesse of their allowance in the day, and drinke the same in the night, so that the officers had soure Mutskins, and the rest thrée at euery meale, the winde as before.</P>
<P>The 22. day in the night, we had the winde againe at Southest with a fine gale, setting out course Northwest and West Northwest.</P>
<P>The 23. day <HI>Iohn Iacob</HI> sonne of <HI>Medenblick</HI> dyed in the <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>The 26. day wee had the winde contrarie at West Northwest, which blew very hard.</P>
<P>The 29. day in the night the winde came faire againe from the North, and then wée kept our course West and by North, and West Northwest: all these dayes the winde was so variable, as it might possible be in our owne countrie, and (as the Pilots sayd) wee were two

hundred leagues Estwards of <HI>Capo de Bonna Esperance.</HI></P>
<P>The first day of Aprill wee turned by the winde, ha∣uing a storme from the West.</P>
<P>The second day (being Easter day) we were allowed to our Easter egges a dish of small beanes, with a dish of dried fish, and a kan of Sacke, in liew of Arack.</P>
<P>The third day <HI>Iohn Ianson</HI> of <HI>Ossenbrugh</HI> Cooper in the ship of <HI>Iohn Martssen</HI> dyed.</P>
<P>The 6. day of the sayd moneth, the winde was againe faire at Northest: but it lasted not long, for here the windes are marueilous variable, with very many du∣rable stormes.</P>
<P>The 13. day wee had sight of land about some 70. leagues Estward of the <HI>Cape,</HI> in the height of 34. degrées and an halfe, and found ground at 80. fathomes, or there∣abouts, being yet as wee gessed fiue leagues from the land, we turned again by the winde, being West South∣west with a storme.</P>
<P>The 17. day wee had the winde faire againe at Est Southest, the Pilots held a parley, and iudged the <HI>Capo de bonna Esperance</HI> to be from vs 68. leagues Northwest and by West.</P>
<P>The 19. day the winde was contrarie from the West.</P>
<P>The 22. day wée were in the height of 37. degrees and 40. minutes, wee wended to passe the <HI>Cape,</HI> and then for the most part wee sailed North Northwest, and North∣west and by North.</P>
<P>The 24. day wee saw land againe: wherefore wee put someward, yet we could not saile higher than South and by West.</P>
<P>The 25. day wee had againe faire weather, the winde first South; afterwards Southest, and so Esterly.</P>
<P>The 27. day, we were in the height of 34. degrees and 40. minutes Westward of the <HI>Cape,</HI> and (as the Pilots sayd) 16. leagues from the land, the winde as before.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="61"/>
The first day of May wee had a fine gale from the South, and were in 32. degrées.</P>
<P>The 9. day of the sayd moneth we were in the height of 22. degrées fiue minutes, we saw euery day <HI>Trombus</HI> or Reedes driuing, which (as men report) driue néere a∣bout the <HI>Cape,</HI> the winde Northwest.</P>
<P>The sixtéenth day about noone wee had sight of the Island of S. <HI>Helena,</HI> wherewith wee were all greatly comforted.</P>
<P>The 17. day in the morning we had sight of a Carrack néere vnto the land, being the Admirall of the Portugals Fléete, sayling into the roade of S. <HI>Helena,</HI> where lay at anchor thrée other Carracks, whereby wee were forced to put into the old Roade, which is the first valley that you come vnto after you are passed the Northwest cor∣ner, or necke of the land, and the Roade where the Car∣racks lay is the third valley beyond the sayd necke of the land, so that we lay within Sakar or Minion shot of each other: wee sent vnto them foure men to parley with them, but I cannot write what communication passed. The same euening came another Carrack making to∣wards the Roade, sailing about the Northwest necke hard vnder the shore, insomuch that she came so néere vn∣to vs, that they haled vs, and demaunded of whence wee were: and vnderstanding that we were Hollanders, see∣king to refresh our selues in that place, (refusing the land) they cast about, and directed their course North∣west to seaward.</P>
<P>The 18. day foure of our men went vp into the land at S. <HI>Helena,</HI> it is a very high hillie land, beautified and in∣riched with very faire and pleasant valleys, with great aboundance of Goates, and some store of Swine: wee meant to prouide our selues there of fresh water, but the Portugales would not suffer vs, so that we were with∣out
<PB REF="62"/>
hope to make any prouision of water at this place: for they had ordained a strong watch on the shore, which was the onely cause that wee could not here refresh our selues.</P>
<P>The 21. being <HI>A scention</HI> day, wee sailed thence (with God his helpe) homewards, and being vnder saile, wée descried another Carrack making towards the Roade, which was the sixt Carrack that we had now seene, wée directed our course Northwest and by West.</P>
<P>Furthermore, touching the Island of S. <HI>Helena,</HI> the same is a very fruitful and an healthsome land, with such incredible multitude of fish in the Roade, that it may seeme a thing hardly to be beléued, the most part Mac∣kerell, and some other small fishes, as Breames, and o∣ther sorts which haue great eyes like vnto Haddocks, but their bodies more flat.</P>
<P>The 25. of the same moneth wee were in thirtéene de∣grées, with a Northest winde, but it lasted not long be∣fore it turned againe to the Southest, and so it continued for the most part after we were past the <HI>Cape.</HI></P>
<P>The 30. day in the morning we had sight of the Island called <HI>Ascention,</HI> which lieth eight degrées Southward the Line, and the same euening we cast our anchors neére to the shore thereof.</P>
<P>The same night we set men ashore to take view of the place, and the next morning wee sent more of our people to search and view all places, but found no fresh water, no not so much as one draft. This Island is full of stonie rocks &amp; holes, like vnto the sinders of Sea-coales which are thorowly burnt: wee saw some Swine also in this Island, not without great marueile how they could there liue, for there is neither trée, leafe, nor grasse, and that much more is, a man is not able to describe the bad∣nes and barrennes of the ground: but a man may there
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
with endgets hill plentie of Seamewes, although some store of people remained there for a time. Also we tooke there some Tortesses, whereof we brought foure aboord our ships, which were so great, that some of them were esteemed to weigh foure hundred pound. There was al∣so some reasonable store of fish to be taken.</P>
<P>The last day of May in the euening wee wayed our anchors, hoysed our sailes, and departed from the Island <HI>Ascention,</HI> with God his helpe, sailing homewards with a fine gale from the Southest, shaping our course North∣west and by West.</P>
<P>In the end, after great paynes, trauaile, and sicknes, which we specially suffered for want of fresh water, these two ships arriued in the <HI>Texell,</HI> and afterwards being discharged of our lading, we came with great comfort to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to the incredible ioye of the owners and Marchants (as may well be thought) seeing now all the eight ships were with great profit safely returned to to their wished home, which had béen sent out the first day of March 1598. in companie to the Islands of the East Indes. The Almightie God be blessed and praised therefore, who with his mightie hand gouerned and brought vs home tho∣row the fearful waues, and ra∣ging gulfes of the Sea.</P>
