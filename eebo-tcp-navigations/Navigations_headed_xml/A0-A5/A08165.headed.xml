And the same battery by the meanes of the often shooting is so ruinated and spoyled, that it is thought the Country people will haue a fort∣nights worke before they can repaire it againe.</P>

<P>From <HI>Breda</HI> we likewise vnderstand for certaine that since <HI>Cordua</HI> his comming to <HI>Spinola</HI> his Campe, they haue made seuerall fierce assaults vpon the Towne of <HI>Bergen-vpzom,</HI> and especi∣ally the first of September <HI>Spinola</HI> (after he had beene repulsed at a halfe Moone in one of the out workes of the Towne assailed certaine new workes lying towards <HI>Breda,</HI> twixt two Forts of the Towne, with certaine <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Walloun</HI> Companies of D. <HI>Cordua:</HI> the which workes were kept by a <HI>Walloun</HI> Commander and cer∣taine <HI>Wallouns,</HI> and for a long time valiantly de∣fended, but being ouer furiously charged by D. <HI>Corduas</HI> Souldiers, was surprised and taken.</P>

<P>SIr, I haue no newes to write to you at pre∣sent but this; The Noble <HI>Hastroke, Brun∣swicks</HI> Brother, had his arme cut off in two places, to the generall griefe of the true hearted.

<P>IT is reported by a Gentleman that came a∣long all the way in Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> Army, from <HI>Sedan</HI> to <HI>Gemblours,</HI> where the battell was fought betweene him and <HI>Gonzales,</HI> that there were some 2000. of his Horse that did mutine

Those neuer gaue a stroke in the battell, and if they had fought as the rest of <HI>Mansfields</HI> forces did, <HI>Don Gonzaloes</HI> Ar∣my had bin (as is very likely) quite ouerthrowne.</P>
<P>We got newes the 30. of <HI>August,</HI> that Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Halberstadt,</HI> lost in the a foresaid fight aboue 2000. men. Wherefore vpon the same and the next day in the euening, we made here great shewes of mirth, making of Bon-fires, discharging of our ordnance, the Mus∣quiteres gaue likewise 3. volies with their shot, and those which carried Pikes, put bundles of straw on them, and went so with them aloft, to spite the Enemy, it seemeth that our who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was set on fire, and the Pipes, Drums, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>∣pets were euery where brauely so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> same was likewise done the next day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>The Garrison within <HI>Berghen</HI> was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meane time very quiet, but the next day, hauing vnder∣stood that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> was safely arriued at <HI>Breda,</HI> with 14000. horse and foots, and that he hauing slaine 3000. of <HI>Gonzaloes</HI> foreces, had got∣ten the field, &amp; taken diuers of his pieces of Ord∣nance besides his money and bagage, they began likewise to make signes of ioy, and discharged a∣bundance both of great and small shot, &amp; in the euening they made exceeding great bon-fires, reioycing mightily in regard of the arriuall of their much expected friends, Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>and the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> who as they hoped should be their redeemer, and free them from their enemies.</P>
<P>By this precedent Relation or Letter, you may perceiue what <HI>Mansfields</HI> very enemies doe pub∣lish of his late battel, which some here in <HI>England</HI> transported with affection, will not beleeue but that he had the worst of it, nay that he was vtter∣ly defeated.</P>
