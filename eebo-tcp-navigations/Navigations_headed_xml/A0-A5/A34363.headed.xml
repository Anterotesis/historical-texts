<HEAD>THE CONSPIRACY OF AENEAS and ANTENOR Against the <HI>State of Troy, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG TYPE="verse paragraph">
<L>LOng time had <HI>Troy</HI> through various Tumults past;</L>
<L>And War laid all her Habitations wast,</L>
<L>A Holy War! for the pretended cause</L>
<L>Was, as 'tis still; Religion and the Laws,</L>
<L>'Twas said the King when he receiv'd his Crown,</L>
<L>Did Bargain with the Gods to Guard his Town;</L>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>And's People claim'd his Coronation-Oath,</L>
<L>But as 'twas wispered then, he broke 'um both:</L>
<L>His Subjects might not their own right dispute;</L>
<L>His Empire was from Heaven and absolute;</L>
<L>Wherefore th' avenging Gods more angry grown,</L>
<L>Espous'd the cause, and made it all their own:</L>
<L>They drove their own Anointed to distress,</L>
<L>And Crown'd a Rebel-Army with success:</L>
<L>At length the King at his own Gate being slain,</L>
<L>And all the <HI>Trojan Towers</HI> Rebuilt again;</L>
<L><HI>Priam</HI> by Right and Merit claims the Throne;</L>
<L><HI>Priam</HI> though young, yet mighty in renown;</L>
<L>For none with greater Courage in the war</L>
<L>Against <HI>Alcides</HI> Bosom broke his Spear:</L>
<L>Thrice through their Ranks his Passage he'd have forc'd,</L>
<L>But being but young, as many time unhors'd:</L>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
<L>Had half his Army half his Courage shown,</L>
<L><HI>Laomedon</HI> till now had kept his Crown.</L>
<L>A happy King in such a Sons defence,</L>
<L>And happy he in being still but Prince.</L>
<L>Never did King at such advantage rise,</L>
<L>Known to be Gracious and reputed Wise,</L>
<L>Born on his Subjects Love, and big with Fate,</L>
<L>Suppos'd the only means to fix the State;</L>
<L>His friendship by each neighbouring Prince embrac'd</L>
<L>And every Subject blest Him as he pass'd;</L>
<L>Whose ev'ry Purse so freely he might use,</L>
<L>His own Estate was thought superfluous;</L>
<L>With which he all his Enemies regain'd,</L>
<L>And with a Golden shower enrich't his Land;</L>
<L>Thus did he Reign near thirty years in Peace,</L>
<L>And saw his Line to fifty Sons encrease.</L>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<L>All which did promise wonders in their Youth,</L>
<L>But in Physiognomy there is no truth.</L>
<L>For al deceiv'd his hopes but only one,</L>
<L>The God-like <HI>Hector,</HI> his brave eldest Son.</L>
<L><HI>Hector</HI> his Fathers Joy, and Countries Pride,</L>
<L>And to whose Sword the Fate of <HI>Troy</HI> was ty'd;</L>
<L>When any State did any Monarch brave,</L>
<L>The proudest Tyrant <HI>Hector</HI>'s Aid would Crave:</L>
<LG TYPE="triplet">
<L>But when too far his Victories did run,</L>
<L><HI>Priam</HI> did only Countermand his Son,</L>
<L>And strait he spew'd up all that he had won;</L>
</LG>
<LG TYPE="triplet">
<L>So when the Zealous Multitude that dwelt</L>
<L>Beyond <HI>Scamander</HI>'s bounding stream rebell'd,</L>
<L>By <HI>Hectors</HI> hand they easily were quell'd;</L>
</LG>
<L>Who then in silent <HI>Triumph,</HI> big with Fame,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Phoebus</HI> to his Fathers Arms he came;</L>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<L>Having restor'd his Heaven to its Peace;</L>
</LG>
<LG TYPE="verse paragraph">
<L>But see a fatal <HI>Helen</HI> sails from <HI>Greece;</HI></L>
<L>Who shall betray your Councels to her Lord,</L>

<L>See how the Neighbouring Potentates Conspire,</L>
<L>And <HI>Chalchas</HI> holy Zeal blows up the Fire:</L>
<L><HI>Chalchas,</HI> th'eternal Foe of <HI>Ilium</HI>'s State,</L>
<L>By Priests-Succession does derive his hate;</L>
<L>He makes all Heaven his Pious Cause Espouse,</L>
<L>And arms more War-like-Saints then <HI>Atlas</HI> knows;</L>
<L>But arm them all, their own Created Shrines</L>
<L>While the <HI>Palladium</HI> in our Temples shines,</L>
<L>Which does from Heaven its Pedigree derive,</L>
<L>The greatest Blessing <HI>Jove</HI> himself could give;</L>
<L>A Guard sufficient if all others fail;</L>
<L>'Gainst which e'en Hell its self shall ne're prevail:</L>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<L><HI>Jove</HI> from his Mount beholds you toyl in vain,</L>
<L>And laughs at all the empty tricks of man:</L>

<L>At our expence the <HI>Grecian</HI> valour try,</L>
<L>And by their Swords a thousand <HI>Trojans</HI> dye;</L>
<L><HI>Ten</HI> thousand <HI>Greeks</HI> lie scattered o're the Strand,</L>
<L>And with their Blood enrich a hostile Land;</L>
<L>But <HI>Priam</HI> when the War came on a pace,</L>
<L>Dispatcht his darling <HI>Polydore</HI> to <HI>Thrace,</HI></L>
<L>And with him a prodigious Sum did send;</L>
<L>No greater errour did this King attend,</L>
<L>Than looking on that <HI>Tyrant</HI> as his friend,</L>
<L>Who, when the fate of <HI>Troy</HI> shall backward run,</L>
<L>And <HI>Priams</HI> Family be quit undone,</L>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<L>Shall seize the Treasure when the brat is slain,</L>

<L>Their thousand Ships, the hopes of their return;</L>
<L>For this Important Action on the Foes,</L>

<L>The proud <HI>Aeneas,</HI> though in Person Mean,</L>
<L>All grant his Mother was the <HI>Cyprean</HI> Queen;</L>
<L>But when her Husband from <HI>Tydides</HI> fled,</L>
<L>The Lord <HI>Anchises</HI> slipt into his bed:</L>
<L>This mother did his credulous Youth abuse,</L>
<L>And baneful Doctrines in his Soul infuse;</L>
<L>In his opinions obstinate and bold,</L>
<L>To save all <HI>Troy</HI> he would not quit his hold,</L>
<L>When he so pleas'd; for high Employments fit;</L>
<L>For grant him Courage though you doubt his Wit.</L>
<L>Strict and severe as all his Creatures know;</L>
<L>Then he's a heart that ne're forgave a foe:</L>
<L>To Love has been a Martyr o're and o're;</L>
<L>Then whom none knew so much, none suffer'd more,</L>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
<L>But when his <HI>Wife Creusa</HI> did expire,</L>
<L>What pity 'twas she perish't in the fire,</L>
<L>And lest the Prince should pine away with grief,</L>
<L>Th' Oraculous Priest afforded this Relief;</L>
<L>Ne're wet your eyes for what you've Left behind,</L>
<L>For Mightier things, and Nobler beds design'd;</L>
<L>The fair <HI>Lavinia</HI> to your Arms I'le bring,</L>
<L>And by her Interest make you more then King;</L>
<L>Pleas'd and astonisht he could nothing say,</L>
<L>In expectation of the happy Day.</L>

<L>'Twas from this Land he got his Love mishap,</L>
<L>But after sleeping in fair <HI>Dido</HI>'s Lap,</L>
<L>Who coud have Dreamt of such an After-Clap?</L>
</LG>
<L>From hence to <HI>Rome</HI> the Miscreant Exile flys,</L>
<L>Depending most upon his Enemies;</L>
<L>His promis'd Empire he demands of Fate,</L>
<L>Neither regarding Subjects Love nor Hate:</L>
<L>Can Providence and such Injustice be?</L>
<L>No, Heav'n it self repents its own Decree:</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI> therefore by the <HI>Stygian</HI> Torrent swore,</L>
<L>No Traytor ere shoud find such Fortune more.</L>
