<HEAD><HI>The first letter from Constantinople,</HI> the <HI>10.</HI> of Iune <HI>1622.</HI></HEAD>
<P>VVE vnderstand from Tartaria that there is great mustering of men, and that they intend to challenge the Throne of <HI>Othoman,</HI> hauing heard of the death of <HI>Osman,</HI> the great Turke: for this it stands, all that vast Countrey from Russia to the Indian and Atlantick Seas, is diuided be∣twixt three chames of ancient and noble race: The first is called <HI>Tartar Cham,</HI> a mighty Em∣peror, possessing the Prouince Mangia besides diuers other great Countreyes: The second <HI>Tartar Mechrit,</HI> vnder whom is <HI>desertum de lop;</HI> and many Nations to the Caspian Sea. The third is <HI>Tartar Chrim,</HI> discending directly from the Family of <HI>Othoman,</HI> who both by birth and contract may challenge the Imperiall Crown of Turkey, if that line shall faile, as is thought that he will doe now, or otherwise reuenge the murther of the aforesaid <HI>Osman</HI> vpon the Iannissaries.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
<P>Also the Letters from <HI>Venice</HI> make men∣tion that some of the principall offenders that layed their hands on the Emperor, are fled, and that the rest at home are diuided, some holding with <HI>Mustapha,</HI> and some with a yonger brother of <HI>Osman</HI> aforesaid. And that <HI>Mustapha</HI> desires not the <HI>Empire,</HI> longing one∣ly to visit the Temple of <HI>Mecha,</HI> being raui∣shed with the promises of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>They write also, that the principall <HI>Musty,</HI> and some Doctors of the Law, haue fore-told and presaged the determination, and finall end of the Turkish greatnesse, perswading the Visirs at the imitation of the Graecians, e∣uery one to step in for a Kingdome, or more.</P>
<P>From <HI>Persia</HI> they certifie vs, that notwith∣standing, through this dissention in <HI>Turkey,</HI> they haue gotten good opportunity to reco∣uer <HI>Tauris,</HI> and other places left; the Sophy be∣ing much displeased with the insolent mur∣ther of the great Turke (as one Prince may act anothers part) is onely resolued to raise an ar∣my, to be reuenged on the <HI>Iannissaires,</HI> where∣vpon the <HI>Beglerbeg</HI> of <HI>Arabia</HI> hath sent him a present of diuers braue Horses.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="3"/>
<P>From <HI>Alexandria</HI> we heare, that the plague is so great in <HI>Gran Cayro,</HI> that about 80000. there haue beene buried within the space of foure moneths, and that the Iewes are flock∣ing in such numbers to the Sea Townes, whereby the traffick is much augmented, and increased in the Straites.</P>
<P>From Algier they write, that the Pirate be∣gin to erect a Common wealth among them∣selues, and haue written to the Hollanders, that if they will vnite with their forces toge∣ther, they will make an notable attempt vp∣on the dominions of the King of Spaine, and begin a possession there.</P>
<P>It is reported here that at Naples there hath been an attempt made vpon the Viceroy by the Nobility and inhabitants, being perplex∣ed with a dearth: but they cry out vpon no∣thing so much as liberty, and lye in waite to put some thing in execution.</P>
<P>These that come from Rome, relate that the Pope hath giuen a free indulgence and pardon of sinnes to all them that will serue the Emperour in his wars, wherupon many soul∣diers and great store of money are sent vnto him.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="4"/>
<P>The Signorie of Venice hath sent lately diuers Gallies at Sea, besides some Gulleons towards Candia, and fortified the Harbours in Histria and Dalmatia, and vpon the conti∣nent about Crema and Brescia, prouideth all the places of importance with strong gar∣risons.</P>
<P>Letters of Millane make mention, that there hath beene an insurrection amongst the Grisons, whereby diuers Spaniards and Imperialists haue beene slaine, and many pla∣ces forsaken, not without great terrour of the rest.</P>
<P>From Genoa it is certified, that some vn∣dertakers haue taken sanctuary, or Asylum, being denied a protection from Spaine, al∣though they say their debts arise, for being en∣gaged about the Catholike Kings affaires.</P>
<P>They write from Florence and Luca, that there is great complaint against the English, seeing they deale not for so many silkes as they were vsed to doe; and therefore they will endeauour to make cloth and cottens of their owne, and not trade with <HI>England,</HI> as in times past.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>From <HI>Poland</HI> the Newes is, that the Iesuites are hatefull to the Inhabitants, wherupon the <HI>Lords</HI> of the Country haue petitioned to the Maiestie of <HI>Sigism<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd,</HI> ei∣ther to banish, or dismisse them, about which there is great discontent occasio∣ned: and heere giue me leaue a little by way of transsition to wonder at this ge∣neration, why they? ouer all the Or∣ders of Religion should so far vary from true Religion, as to delight in murther, combustion of Kingdomes, ostentation of knowledge, rapture of visi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, and especially setting Princes at division, yea breaking the band of amitie betweene Prince and Subiect, sure I can yeeld you no r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ason for it? but this as it fareth with Children, who sucking of a froward nur∣ses breast become accordingly froward and pettish in their liues: so they having one <HI>Ignatius Loyalta</HI> a Souldier to their Fa∣ther of a fiery disposition, no doubt ac∣cording to his name, doe immitate him in the fierie and bloody stepps of warre and dissention: God grant that all Prin∣ces
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> may take heede of their pollicies. For in my Conscience they would pull down the <HI>Papacy,</HI> if they could, and set vp their owne Superintendancy.</P>
<P>They also write, that from the Cit∣tie of <HI>Leopolis</HI> and the Country adiacent, much Corne hath beene transported to <HI>Constantin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple</HI> in this time of their dearth through the Blacke Sea, whereby they haue beene wonderfully enriched, as the Turkes neighbourly are releived.</P>
<P>From <HI>Spaine,</HI> there is newes of the feare of the Mores, who haue lately made an attempt in <HI>Granado,</HI> and word is brought by a <HI>Brazill</HI> man into <HI>Portingall,</HI> that the wilde men about the River of <HI>Amazones,</HI> haue rebelled against the <HI>Portingals,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who governe the Country and rule there. Much like that vnfortunate mischiefe which hath happened of late in Virginia▪ where we heare almost 300. of the English Plantation were slaine by the perfidiousnes of the old Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The second, from <HI>Vienna</HI> the 22, day, This Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie is much quieted since the Em∣perours
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> Marriage, for heere are many Nobles and Ladies, who professe the Gos∣pel, and haue their Congregations with∣out the walles of the Cittie, to the num∣ber sometime of fortie or fiftie Coaches, all which liue here vndisturbed by reason the Emperesse entertaines them gracious∣ly, and they attend the Court with all humilitie when occasion serveth; where∣as before they stood vppon their guard, and their Servants rodd with pistols and petronels to the Church: And (God be thanked) the <HI>Iesuites</HI> cannot divert him from his resolution, to keepe good quar∣ter with his Subiects, although they haue many times attempted the same. Or other wise it may be, their great numbers keepe all in awe, and that the Emperour is loath to be troubled with warres abroad, and dissentions at home.</P>
<P>From <HI>Odenburgh,</HI> is here newes that the Emperour proposed to the Lords and States, the Coronation of his Sonne, but that they absolutely denyed it, as ha∣ving made choice of another.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<P>It was also Reported, that the Co∣sackes having no Warres in Poland, threatned to come downe into Hunga∣ria, which the Iesuits vrged, and the Em∣perour intertayned, but it is sayd, and thought, the Tartarians and Russians will keepe them backe with their Incursions and Enterprises, which they intend to make shortly.</P>
<P>In those parts are still made great mu∣sterings, to supply the Emperours warres. This Cittie, <HI>Prague</HI> it selfe, hath guard and watch like a Towne of warre, and they beate vnto the <HI>Parado,</HI> as if the enemie lay before it. In plaine termes, they are iea∣lous one of another, and the Heires and Friends of those whom the Emperour put to execution, long to be revenged. As for the Iewes, though they generally reioyce at those dissentions among <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> and slaughtering one another, yet doe they particularly rather fauour the Protestants then the Catholiques.</P>
<P>From <HI>Moravia,</HI> wee vnderstand that the
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> Marquis of <HI>Iaggerendorf,</HI> remayneth con∣stant to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and hath written to Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> for his com∣ming into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> alledging if hee doe attempt that, he shall be sure to finde many Friends for his passage into <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> where, if the warre beganne againe, no question, some great alteration will follow: for <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> is now at lea∣sure to take his part, and will question∣lesse assist him, if he can prosecute any course to come neere him.</P>
<P>The fourth, from <HI>Cullen</HI> the first of Iu∣ly. The Baron of <HI>Anholt</HI> hath threatned the Countrey of the Landtgraue of <HI>Hes∣sen,</HI> in behalfe of the Imperialistes; hee intends to recover the places in <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stpha∣lia,</HI> taken by the Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Bruns∣wick,</HI> but the Inhabitants are all rather for <HI>Brunswick,</HI> then the Bishop of <HI>Cullen,</HI> from whom they were taken.</P>
<P>From <HI>Franckfort</HI> we vnderstand, that the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> hath imposed a harsh Commandement in his Townes, for the
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> searching of Passengers, and although he seemeth discontent at <HI>Bavaria's</HI> pro∣ceedings, yet doth he governe Silesia for the Emperour, or at least so much of it as the Catholiques are willing to submit vnto him. But among other things, the Bishops are most fierce against the Protestants, and will not suffer them to goe vnto their Churches.</P>
<P>From <HI>Poland</HI> we haue Newes, that the inhabitants being become loath of the Ie∣suits, the Nobilitie hath requested the King, either to banish or dismisse them, about which is great discontent occasio∣ned.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Noragrad</HI> in Russia, that the Iesuites had layd a plott with certaine Prussians, to robbe and surprise the Abbey of Saint <HI>Nuclay</HI> in <HI>Muscovia,</HI> adioyning almost to the Sea, which they did either out of envie, at the flourish∣ing of the Greeke Church, then which there is nothing more hatefull to the Ro∣man, or out of a common disposition, and
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> wicked perversenesse to raise quarrels be∣tweene Countries, and nourish enmitie betweene Princes.</P>
<P>The last from <HI>Franckfort,</HI> the first of Iu∣ly. After the arrivall of the Duke of <HI>Bruns∣wick</HI> at <HI>Mainhem,</HI> where he was stately well-commed; the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> see∣ing the Countrey was not able to sustaine his Forces, called a Counsell of Warre, and resolved to depart; leaving the <HI>Pala∣tinate</HI> to the care and tuition of the Lord <HI>Belfast,</HI> and Generall <HI>Vere;</HI> with whom he also left eight thousand men more then they had, and so they devided them∣selues, that they presently marched ten thousand horse, and twentie thousand Foote.</P>
<P>The King and <HI>Mansfeild</HI> ar now in <HI>Al∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tia,</HI> prosecuting the Warre there against the Emperours Brother <HI>Leopaldus,</HI> burning, spoyling, and taking the Countrey to his obedience, the which will constraine <HI>Tilly</HI> soone to forsake the siege of <HI>Heidel∣burge,</HI> and follow the King, and so by this
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> meanes divert the Warre into his Ene∣mies Countrey: He hath sent the Duke of <HI>Brunswick</HI> into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to furnish the Kings Armie with provision, and then to march and ioyne both together, and so to goe forward as toward Bohemia, as God shall giue them leaue. They were no sooner gone, but <HI>Tilly</HI> advanced his Forces towardes <HI>Ladenburgh,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Heidelburgh.</HI> Whereupon Sir <HI>Gar∣ret Herbert</HI> Commaunder there of the Ca∣stle, assembled the Burgers and Inhabi∣tants to know both their abilitie, and re∣solutions, whether they would endure the siege or no, &amp; how long they thought their provision would last: they answe∣red generally, that they would liue and die with him, and so they prepared them∣selues to endure the siege. And it was thought that <HI>Tilly</HI> did this rather to di∣vert them from their Iourney into <HI>Alsatia,</HI> then to bestow so much time in the siege of a Towne which could profit him l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle in the obtaining more, then the possession of the place, vnlesse the Emperour were
<PB N="13" REF="8"/> resolued contrary to his owne Embassy, to make it a continuall warre. <HI>Tilly</HI> going on with his siege, tooke two of the inha∣bitants, and cut off their heads, which he pitched vpon poles, turning their faces toward the towne to terrifie the Burgers: but they in requitall cut off fiue souldier▪ heads, &amp; serued them so likewise. <HI>Gonsales</HI> in the meane time being at <HI>Opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nheim,</HI> was yet doubtfull whether he would set vpon <HI>Mainheim</HI> or <HI>Frankendale,</HI> and so to get the Palatinate at once, lest it be gotten a∣gaine: but there is a God that holdeth the windes in his hands, and will no doubt hold backe that resolution, which must be the cause of so much blood-shedding, if the warres should goe forward in such a manner: but what will be the issue, time will reueale.</P>
<P>The <HI>Landgraue</HI> of <HI>Hessen,</HI> mistrusting lately the forraging of his countrey by the Imperials, writ to the Princes of the vnion concerning the same, who all re∣turned, that their cause was a common feare, and therefore they would liue and die together in maintaining the generall
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> cause of Religion, and particular defen∣ding one anothers Countrey.</P>
<P>In the same Letter was likewise set downe the resolution of diuers Imperiall Cities, <HI>viz. Auspurg, Norremburg, Witten∣burg, Francfort, Strasburg,</HI> and some other, for the maintaining of the confession of <HI>Auspurg,</HI> which was the resolution of the Protestant Faith, bought out long since by great summes of Money of <HI>Rodolphus</HI> and <HI>Matthias,</HI> former Emperors. Where∣upon these Cities fortified their walls, had their Burgers in Armes, for feare to bee surprized.</P>
<P>We haue heard from <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> that the Imperials had lately gone about to sur∣prize the said Citie, and had gotten fortie men through a Vault within the Walls, but were all presently shot to death, and the Citie preserued of that dangerous en∣terprise.</P>
<P>In <HI>Hungaria</HI> the matters stand yet doubt∣full: the <HI>Hungarians</HI> haue flatly denyed the Coronation of the Emperors sonne: the Clergie desires to haue all the Spiri∣tuall goods backe againe, with the arrera∣ges,
<PB N="15" REF="9"/> but the States and Lay-men will re∣store them but a part. They can neyther agree vpon many other points: so that it is likely nothing will be concluded at the Dyet.</P>
<P>Here was flying newes, that the Empe∣ror was taken prisoner, but it is not true: but this is certaine, <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> and the Lord <HI>Bridiani</HI> are very strongly marched vp in armes.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Glatz</HI> and <HI>Klingenburgh</HI> stand yet brauely out, and haue lately giuen a great Ouerthrow vnto the Imperiallists, and they grow daily stronger &amp; stronger. The old Count of <HI>Thorne</HI> is reported to be vpon the way with 26000. men, to res∣cue them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Denmarke</HI> they write, that the King hath sent diuerse Presents to the <HI>Queene</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> at the <HI>Hage,</HI> and written sundry Letters of comfort &amp; consolation, assuring of his assistance as wel of Men as Money: and that hee hath requested the Hauen Townes to arme diuers Souldiers to goe into <HI>Westphalia,</HI> to helpe and supply those garrisons which <HI>Brunswick</HI> left there.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> lately come from <HI>Swe∣den</HI> report, that the Captaine of <HI>Calmar</HI> ca∣stle was called in question for his life, as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing betrayed by a counterfeit letter, written by some secret malitious enemy, as though the same came from <HI>Poland</HI> for the surrendring of the fort when time should serue: but his innocency saued his life, and the matter was soone taken vp.</P>
<P>From <HI>France</HI> it is written, that the king is resolued to go forward in his enterpri∣ses against the Protestant townes. That the Iesuites are iealous of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and he gets but the kings displea∣sure by his violent courses. That the Pro∣testants will rather make sallies and die in the field then in their houses. That <HI>Mountalbo</HI> is so well prouided of all kind of prouision, that they thinke the king will not easily b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siege it againe. Those of <HI>Mompellier</HI> prepare themselues likewise, if his Maiestie would attempt any thing a∣gainst them.</P>
<P>That the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> increase<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h his army dayly, and hopeth vpon a great per∣son in <HI>France.</HI> That the king is much
<PB N="17" REF="10"/> discontented, and hath a growing disease vpon him. That the <HI>Rochellers</HI> take dayly prizes, and were resolued to make a sally vpon the Duke of <HI>Espernon,</HI> being strong and able to minister many braue souldi∣ers. That there is a prohibition for the landing of the English at <HI>Callice,</HI> or on those Coasts. That diuers Apologies are written in the defence of the Protestants, and that the Queene laboureth what she may to pacifie the troubles.</P>
<P>From <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sels</HI> they write, that if the Ambassadours doe not suddenly agree vpon a peace, it is feared that the warre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will increase both in the Palatinate, and the Low Countries. My Lord of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gile</HI> hath almost filled his Regiment, and they lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke for foure or fiue thousand Brit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> more to come vnto them within this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weekes.</P>
