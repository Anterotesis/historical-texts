<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> A full Account of the Discovery of the Villanous Design of the <HI>French Papists.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE 150 <HI>French</HI> Papists which were pickt out of the Army, are now at <HI>Carling∣ford,</HI> and among them 'tis said there is one Jesuit, all ready to be shipt for <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> There is but four of the <HI>French,</HI> and two <HI>Irish</HI> that were going to <HI>Charle∣mount</HI> to suffer, and of them one of the <HI>French</HI> is to be executed; his Crime, and the whole Discovery was thus: He that is to be executed, was formerly a Count in <HI>France,</HI> had Moneys from the <HI>French</HI> King to raise a Regiment, spent it, and not daring to shew his face, got to <HI>Holland,</HI> and from thence for <HI>England,</HI> where he insinuated himself into the Army, pretending to be a Protestant, though he never was one, and came with the Army hither, where he writ a Letter to King <HI>James,</HI> that in case he would assure him of a Pardon from the <HI>French</HI> King, he would bring over to him 400 Men; that he should send his Answer in a Letter, which was to be brought into the <HI>French</HI> Camp, by some Fellow, who, as a Countryman, was to come with a Cross of white and red under the cover or folding of his Sleeve, and a Bottle of Brandy, crying, <HI>Brandy-wine, Brandy-wine,</HI> and so up and down only in the <HI>French</HI> Quarter, till one came to him, and said, <HI>God bless you Friend, how do you sell your Brandy?</HI> and turn up his Sleeve to look for the Cross; which when the Huckster perceived, he was to deliver the Letter from King <HI>James</HI> to him. The Messenger going with this Letter to the <HI>Irish</HI> Camp, being taken, discovered the Author, and it's said, had his Pardon for it. This coming to the General, he forth∣with gave orders to make publick Proclamation, at the head of each Regiment, <HI>That if any Papist was in the Army, did deny himself to be so, and afterward discovered, he should im∣mediately be put to Death, without more ado.</HI> And thereupon most, if not all the aforesaid 150 were singled out. Since this Discovery, there is not one <HI>French</HI> man permitted to pass any Guard, without a Pass, any where out of the Camp: and orders are given to all Officers, to proclaim, at the head of every Regiment, <HI>That if there be any Roman Catholick, that shal not forthwith declare himself publickly to be so, if afterward discovered, shall be punished with im∣mediate Death.</HI> And it's said, that upon that Proclamation, most, if not all those at <HI>Carling-ford</HI> are found out to be such.</P>

<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> To His Grace the Duke of <HI>Schomberg,</HI> General of Their Majesties Forces in <HI>Ireland.</HI> The Hum∣ble Address of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the behalf of the whole, for the Province of <HI>Ulster.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHereas we the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> since the Landing of the <HI>English</HI> Army are threatened, and some abuses already committed upon them by those that call themselves Protestants, and for their pretence to abuse us and make us odious in the sight of the General and the whole Camp, do asperse and put forth, that we the said People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> was aiding and assisting to the late King <HI>James</HI> in his War, with Money to maintain a Regiment against the Protestants; which said Aspersion and envious In∣formation, we in the behalf of the rest of our Friends do utterly and solemnly deny, and in the sight of God, can declare we never were aiding nor assisting the said King with Money or any thing else, save the Quartering men on free Quarter, which no Prote∣stant could avoid no more than we; but on the contrary are great sufferers, insomuch that many have not left them to sustain their Families, but stript their Clothes off their Backs, taken their Goods and Victuals out of their Houses, their Horses and Cows taken from them, and left in a state of starving, and not spared more than any other Protestant where suffering hath been.</P>
<P>Therefore we humbly desire and intreat thee, in our plain way, as we are an Inno∣cent People, and desire to live peaceably, and do unto all men as we would have them do unto us; that thou would be pleased to give forth thy Order to the Army, and other Protestants in the Country, that are wrong informed against us, that they may not Rob us of our Goods, nor molest our Bodies or Families, for we are a People that desires Peace, and is always willing to live honestly and soberly, and pay our tribute to whom it is due. Therefore we make bold to present thee with this our Address as unto a Chri∣stian Governour, hoping thou wilt be pleased to take us into thy Care and Favour, that we may not be further exposed to spoil and ruin: As in Duty bound we shall humbly pray the Lord to be thy Reward.</P>
