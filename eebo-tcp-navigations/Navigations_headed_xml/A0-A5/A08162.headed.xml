<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am very loath to trouble you with a Pre∣face, yet at this time you must pardon me; for it is for Gods cause, to exemplifie his glory &amp; providence, that hath put an hook in the nostrils of <HI>Leviathan,</HI> and kept him from devouring poore <HI>Christians,</HI> who yet are in Armes to devoure one another: that hath throwne a stone from Heaven to strike the golden Image to powder, which was stretching it selfe, to overlooke and overtopp the <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>Europe;</HI> that hath put an Axe to the great tree, and felld it at a blow, which was beginning to over∣spread the earth, and be a shaddow for the beasts of the field. What, all <HI>Christendome</HI> almost in Armes, and yet the <HI>Turke</HI> not to take the advantage, but to be pulld short by the hand of God, and throwne backward into a graue? Where are your dreaming <HI>Gazettes,</HI> and <HI>Coranto's</HI> now, that talkt of such formidable preparation, and so many hun∣dred thousand in an Army? Where is the threatning of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> and terrifying the <HI>Cossacks</HI> with so many thousand <HI>Tartarians?</HI> Where is their comming into <HI>Hungary,</HI> to be∣gin a new Warre there? What all husht and quiet? Why, then thine be the honour O God, and all power, and maiestie, and goodnesse be attributed vnto thee? For thou hast taken pitty vpon our afflictions, and wilt set vpright thine owne cause, when the children of <HI>Edom</HI> and inhabitants of <HI>Babylon,</HI> cry downe with the walls of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and insult with clapping
<PB REF="3"/> their hands, to see the enemies of the Gospell thriue in their outragiousnesse.</P>
<P>This then is all I would say vnto you by the way of Intro∣duction, to giue God the prayse, that the great <HI>Turke</HI> is dead so opportunely, whereby there is hope, that <HI>Europe</HI> shall be preserved from their inuasion, and those affrightings. And the same God, that hath compassionated the generall distresses of <HI>Christendome,</HI> take pittie likewise on the parti∣cular passions of <HI>Princes,</HI> that they rage not in their reven∣ges, nor runne too violently forward in their race of bloud and destruction; but admit of peace and pacification to the eternall memory of their vertues, and worthinesse.</P>

<HEAD>THE STRANGLING AND DEATH, OF THE GREAT TVRKE, A STRANGE STORY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hough I neede not speake a word of former Em∣perours of <HI>Turkey,</HI> or their actions, or their liues, or their <HI>Alcharon,</HI> from whence the speciall im∣positions on their Governerment are, first, to erect some Famous <HI>Monument</HI> toward the exalta∣tion of their Religion. Secondly, and performe some memorable enterprise for the enlarging their <HI>Empire:</HI> yet must I name <HI>Mahomet</HI> the third, to keepe my selfe closer to the Story, that you may know the severall passages in the same. This <HI>Mahomet</HI> left two Sonnes behind him, <HI>Achmet</HI> and <HI>Mustapha; Achmet</HI> at 15. yeeres old was chosen Emperor, and li∣ved some 15. yeeres longer, or thereabouts and although by reason of the peace betweene the Emperour <HI>Rodulphus</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> &amp; him∣selfe, as also the contract betweene the <HI>Pelomans</HI> &amp; himselfe, wher∣in those <HI>Antiqua foedera</HI> were renewed, he did little worthy of me∣mory, concerning Heroijck enterprises, and military exploites: yet he had the Fortune to keepe correspondēcy with his <HI>Basshawes,</HI> and <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> and tooke a course by enlarging their entertainement, and other severall donatiues, to enlarge their heartes, and good li∣king towards him: so that he had very seldome mutinies, or inno∣vation, because the <HI>Viceer</HI> of the Army drew them still into the field in the Summer, and the <HI>Viceer</HI> of the City, afforded them their Aun∣cient liberty in the Winter: but at last there was a rebellion by the <HI>Serivano</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> whom some confound with the name of <HI>Basshaw</HI> of <HI>Alleppo,</HI> which was fortunately, and wisely prevented: and in the ende of his Raigne the controversies of the Princes of <HI>Molda∣via,</HI> over wrought the <HI>Polacks</HI> to commiserate the cause &amp; wrought a mischiefe, which was not ended without vnspeakeable trouble: For the distastings beginning in <HI>Achmets</HI> time, could never admit of reconciliation: till <HI>Achmets</HI> Sonne came in person with terror, and threatnings into the fieldes of <HI>Bogdonia.</HI></P>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<P>Well? <HI>Achmet</HI> dies, leaving 2. young Sonnes behind him, <HI>Osman</HI> and another: yet some will presume to say, that being not aboue 34 yeeres old, he had many Children, and 300 Wiues or Concubines: but before he dyed, to make all sure, he resolues to strangle his bro∣ther <HI>Mustapha,</HI> and according to custome will leaue no Competi∣tors in such an <HI>Empire.</HI> For which purpose a Guard of <HI>Capagies</HI> at∣tend at the Iron gates of the <HI>Seralio,</HI> and the <HI>Mutes</HI> are placed in a roome accordingly. Now you must consider, that though they haue many wayes to enlarge their cruelties, and dispatch offenders, yet none is so affrighting, as the presenting of these Officers, for they never come along without death in their company, and ghastlines in their lookes. Sometimes an offender is carried from the <HI>Seralio,</HI> by the Officers of their <HI>Tapinaco,</HI> such as we say M<SUP>r</SUP>. of the Ordnāce, over the Sea, &amp; in the midway a great stone is tyed about his neck, and he is cast into the bottome, and then according to his greatnes, a greater Cannon is shot off, vnlesse the Emperour send a counter∣mand; er he be from the water: sometimes an offender is beheaded: sometimes throwne off a rocke: sometimes set vpon by the <HI>Ianiza∣ries,</HI> &amp; cut in peeces, as the <HI>Haga</HI> or Captaine is limited, yet in these cases as the Emperors fury is leniated, they many times escape: but when the <HI>Mutes</HI> come in place, all are displaced, against whom their Commission is enlarged. Thus is <HI>Mustapha</HI> to be dispatched, but see how the stronger arme puts out the strong men? the same night <HI>Achmet</HI> had a <HI>dreame</HI> or fearefull <HI>vision,</HI> which some of the <HI>Deruices</HI> would needes presume to rumor abroad, in this manner; that hee thought as he was entring into the 7. Towers, the princely prison of his Predecessors, his brother kneeled downe before him, and cry∣ed out, Oh when shal we leaue this horrible custome of shedding in∣nocent blood? looke among all the Heathens, and see, how quickly they loathed and cast away that crying Sin of sacrificing of humane flesh? but in steede of replying he drew his Semiter to strike off his head, had not one as hee conceited held it fast, that hee could not strike; whereupon he demanded angerly, what art thou? I am the good <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Mustapha,</HI> and will not suffer him to perish, there∣fore leaue: and very shortly shall strange things happen in the <HI>Em∣pire.</HI> Little thought the great Turke, to haue found a greater Greatnesse in his sleepe, but such was the power of God, or as
<PB REF="4"/> the Turkes conceited the fortune of <HI>Mustapha,</HI> that his bro∣ther <HI>Achmate</HI> contrary to all expectation the next morning after his Dreame, sent for him into the roome of <HI>State,</HI> where he lay on as stately a Pallet, with all his <HI>Viceroys</HI> and <HI>Bashaws</HI> groueling on the ground, and the principall <HI>Mufty</HI> knee∣ling before him reading on a booke. It should seeme that glad tydings came first to the Citie; For hee was taken out of the prison with great respect, and obseruation: hee was admitted to his Gally with high ceremonies, and yet solemne countenances: hee was accompanied on the Sea with thou∣sands of boates, and tenne thousand of weeping eyes: hee landed at the Emperours one <HI>Caska</HI> with great respect and modest stilnesse: hee walked through the Garden of <HI>Cipres</HI> trees, and at last came to an iron gate, where his owne com∣pany left him, except two <HI>Bashawes,</HI> who led him by the armes: the gate opens and he must through a gard of <HI>Cupo∣gies,</HI> they bend to the ground, and yet looke cheerefully: till at last the Prince spake as cheerefully to the <HI>Bashawes,</HI> saying What need all this quoile and ceremonies to a dying man? or tormenting of my soule, when I goe to the execu∣tion of my body? in all extremities there is a curtesie in di∣spatch, and when a man must dye, Oh let him dye at once, and not be more tortured with the feare and circumstances, then with the thing it selfe: they durst not reply; but brought him into the roome, where the <HI>Mutes</HI> stood: whose pre∣sence did no more appall him then the rest, but that hee saw the cruelty confirmed, and their very sight was worse, then an vnreuersable iudgement: but when hee perceiued no violent hands laid vpon him, and that he must yet goe further, he was the more astonished, and the more vexed to endure such a procrastination.</P>
<P>At last he came where the Emperour lay sicke on his Pal∣let, before whom his prostitution was as the ordinary slaues: but contrary to all expectation he bad him rise, and comman∣ded certaine Persian Carpets to be spread, &amp; rich Cushions to be laid; on which, according to their manner, he sate crosse legg'd by him, and when the <HI>Mufty</HI> had raised the Emperor
<PB REF="5"/> vp a little, with a faint voyce, he thus discouered an vnlookt for louing heart.</P>
<P>Brother (said hee) I am taught by story, and the story of <HI>Galba</HI> among the Romanes, to chuse a Successor for the com∣mon-wealth, and not an heire in my family. This made him looke vpon <HI>Piso,</HI> as worthy to be an Emperour, because hee had experience of his vertues, and not vpon his kindred, be∣cause hee was vnacquainted with their strength to beare so great a burthen: I cannot compare our greatnesse with the Romanes, but I am sure wee are too great for children, or fooles: I haue faire issue of my owne, but so weake armes cannot sway the Scepter of our <HI>Othoman</HI> family, and to leaue them vnder <HI>Tutelage,</HI> Who is there worthy to aduise such Princes, or what account can slaues make of the gouern∣ment, when their owne vices shall ouerflow their bankes without restraint, and the enuie of others look vpon them ra∣ther with disobedience, then obseruation? therefore to auoid all tumultuous occasions, and to make thee beleeue, thou art the charge of our <HI>Prophet Mahomet:</HI> in steed of death-like presents it selfe in steed of a prison: this is thy Pallace, and whereas thou camst in groueling, thou shalt goe out trium∣phing: the decree of heauen will haue it so, and a voyce from heauen commands it so; only this I must conclude, that as I haue remembred thee, thou wilt not forget me and mine, let not custome ouermaster vertue, nor the iealousie in Soue∣raignty be an enemy to thy pitty: but let young <HI>Osman</HI> liue as I haue determined, thou shalt not dye: yea, the wonder is the greater, that of a captiue I haue made thee an Empe∣rour, and in steed of the terrors of affliction, brought thee out to the rauishings of <HI>Maiestie.</HI></P>
<P>He had no sooner done, but he began to faint, and so read them all a lesson of mortality by opening a booke, wherein they saw death writ in Capitall letters, and himselfe sinking past recouery, which made them recouer new Spirits, and presently bring his brother out into the <HI>Sophia,</HI> where the principall <HI>Mufty</HI> proclaimed <HI>Mustapha</HI> Emperour, intima∣ting to the Ianizaries the charge of <HI>Achmate,</HI> to the dischar∣ging
<PB REF="5"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> larges, which equalling the bounty of other Princes, ouersway∣ed nicer exceptions, and so with great acclamations they rati∣fied the Election, and cryed out, liue and raigne great <HI>Musta∣pha.</HI> The next worke was the solemnity of <HI>Achmets</HI> Funerals, for whom a sumptuous monument, and <HI>Chappell</HI> was erected, not inferiour to any of his Auncestors: then were Commissio∣ners appointed to ouer-looke the <HI>Seralios,</HI> and sequester such women, as had beene carnally knowne of <HI>Achmet</HI> to their ac∣customed Pallaces, and accustomed manner of magnificence, and expences. Presently followed the setling of the <HI>Bashawes</HI> in their authority, in their seuerall Prouinces, and ouer-looking the Citie Officers with confirmation of such, as were worthy. Last of all, his Armies and Nauies were mustred, not that hee pretended any warre, but because he would commit no Solle∣cisme in gouernment, or giue the Souldiers occasion to suspect, that he knew not, how to maintaine his greatnesse: Thus is <HI>Mustapha</HI> Emperour, and they had two yeeres triall of his disposition, whereby they found him harmlesse, and rather sub∣iect to the Epithites of quiet Princes, then transcending Enco∣mions of great and stirring Spirits.</P>
<P>But oh the condition of man, and instability of terrestiall blessings! Prince <HI>Mustopha</HI> was scarce warme in this throne of Soueraignty, and setting forward in the rare of imperiousnes, before <HI>Scander</HI> and <HI>Mehemet Bashaw</HI> takes the young <HI>Osman</HI> out of the <HI>Seralio,</HI> and presents him to the Ianizaries, a comely, sweet young youth of nine or ten yeeres old, demanding with∣all, if such an heire of the <HI>Othomon</HI> family were to be reiected without cause, or why they should bring an harmlesse Prince (as they reputed <HI>Mustapha</HI>) into the danger of vsurpation, and differing no further from a Traytor, but that it was not impu∣ted to him, as for <HI>Achmats</HI> Will? Empires are not so transla∣ted, and what could they tell, but priuate men for their owne ends had wrought vpon his weaknes, making a diseased tongue speak that, which a healthfull heart, and perfect sence would not consent to: For it was not probable, that a Father would disinherit his children for any brother in the world: Besides, there was no triall, or cause either of insufficiencie, or disability,
<PB REF="6"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not beleeue it. La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of all, for any thing they saw, <HI>Mustapha</HI> himselfe was not stirring or strong enough to play the Steeres man in such an high built ship, con∣sidering the Seas were tempestuous, and many dangerous shores and rockes were to be passed by.</P>
<P>These speeches to the turbulent Ianizaries, were like fewell to fire, and the presence of the louely youth, made them amazed at their inconstancie: so that by way of penitencie and satisfaction, they quickly altered the acclamation of liue <HI>Mu∣stapha</HI> into the cries of, God saue young <HI>Osman,</HI> and so with∣out further disputing, hee was aduanced into the Throne, and brought into the <HI>Seralio,</HI> when <HI>Mustapha</HI> least thought of the alteration. But now there is no remedy, he must needs be de∣posed, and sent prisoner once againe into the seauen Towers; his friends more confounded to be so affronted, then amazed at the alteration: yet suspecting the worst, they abandoned the Pallace, and thinking it pollicy to shift for themselues, had the lesse honesty to neglect their Emperour: but the truth is, they saw manifest signes of a rebellion, and the conspiracie was too great and too strong for them to resist, which made them giue way to the violence, least they should haue beene caried head∣long to destruction.</P>
<P>Now doth <HI>Osman</HI> begin his <HI>Phaetons</HI> flourish, and run∣neth the course of pleasures with his youth, spending foure or fiue yeeres in wantonnesse and iollity, while his <HI>Bashawes</HI> spent the time in couetousnesse and ambitious ouer-ruling o∣thers: yet not without carefull ouer-looking the Ianizaries, and prouident preuenting their discontents, and turbulent dis∣position: but all doth helpe; for they ouer accustomed to actiue imployment, and liuing vpon the spoile of forraigne Nations, as much as the Emperours entertainement, cried out to the warre, and when answere was made, that the Persians had contracted a new league, and the Emperours of <HI>Germanies</HI> old couenants were not yet determined or ended, They presently replyed, the indignities which the Russians had offered to their neighbours the Tartarians, were not to be endured, and they need goe no further, then the piracies of the black Sea, and the iniuries of the Cossacks and Polonians:
<PB REF="6"/> Nay, why should they not march to the expugnation of <HI>Locpo∣lis,</HI> and the foraging of the Countries of <HI>Moldania</HI> and <HI>Bogdo∣nia,</HI> and so forward to teach <HI>Poland</HI> a better lesson, then to dis∣please the <HI>Othoman</HI> Family and mightinesse.</P>
<P>The Bashawes knew, there was no replying, nor now the fire was kindled no other quenching it, then letting it consume to cinders, wherupon they presently answered, they were glad that the Souldiers were so memorable of the glory of the Em∣pire, and so ready to imploy themselues for the dignity of the Nation, and therefore they would not by any meanes hinder them, or the cause: But they should find the Emperor as care∣full to satisfie their demaunds, as they were willing to augment his Greatnes: so that if they would giue way vnto time for the preparing of all things fit for the Army, and the sending for the Tartarians to accompany them in the iourney, the Emperour should goe in person into the Field, and <HI>Poland</HI> soone finde, what it was to exasperate such a Maiesty.</P>
<P>Whereupon some will haue it, that there were Letters of defiance presently sent against <HI>Sigismond,</HI> and the Warre pro∣claymed by sound of Trumpet to affright all <HI>Europe:</HI> In what manner the Turke proceeded, I will not now dispute, sure I am that the King of <HI>Pole</HI> made all Christian Princes acquainted with the threatnings, and implored their assistance for the Op∣position: He sent vnto the Emperour to hearken to a Peace, if it were possible, and correspondent with his Honour, that he might spare his Forces rather against the generall Enemy of Christendome, then the particuler reuenges of one another: Oh blessed be the feet of those, that bring the glad tidings of Peace, and happy is that Princely disposition, that would auoyde the effusion of Christian Blood: hee sent vnto his Holines to re∣member the cause of the Church, and the affrightings of Reli∣gion, so that now was the time to assist him with men and mo∣ney, and if euer <HI>Poland</HI> were reputed the Bulwarke of Christi∣anity, and to be maintained accordingly, it was at this instant to be looked vpon with the eyes of pitty and commiseration. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00000. Turkes and Tartars were in readinesse to ouer-runne the Country, and deuoure the Inhabitants: He sent into <HI>France</HI> by way of intercession to spare his hand frō taking such fearefull reuenges on his owne people, &amp; to spare him but those

<P>When the <HI>Gran Signeur</HI> was made acquainted with the for∣wardnes of these <HI>Polonians,</HI> and vnderstood they were already encamu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and expected his comming, he was too young to ap∣prehend any feare, &amp; not olde enough to lay the blame of his re∣tardance where it was: therfore they made the more hast, when he vnderstood the occasion, and so according to former prepa∣ration, the establishment of diuers Gouernments, the ordering the Prouinces, the setling the great Citty, the mustring his Gal∣lyes, the guarding of his Castles, and the watching of the blacke Sea: the Tartars vnited themselues to his Army, &amp; both toge∣ther made a body of 200000. which with all magnificent pre∣paration he presented in the same Fields, and within sight of the <HI>Polonians,</HI> where he pitched his Imperiall Tent, and setled him∣selfe with vnparaleld Maiesty: the high Priests and Doctors of Law attended him, the two great Bashawes accompanied him, the throng of Ianizaries waited vpon him, and the fry of Tar∣tars brought the Cariages vp apace.</P>
<P>When all thinges were setled, the Tartars after their accusto∣med manner with great clamours and outcryes, and with as great multitudes gaue vpon the Polonians, and thought to haue
<PB REF="7"/> made but one battaile &amp; day of tryall of the busines, but when they came to passe ouer Riuers, and assaile Trenches, when they heard the thunders of 20 Pieces of Ordnance, and felt the mis∣chiefe and damage: when they were encountred with 10000. well armed Horse, and driuen backe with the fury of couragi∣ous hearts: they knew not what to say, and lesse to doe; nay, though the Ianizaries came as a second vnto them, and brought many field Pieces to answer the discurtesie of their Camp Ord∣nance, yet by reason they had not the discipline of Gabions, they were subiect to the greater destruction, and the Souldier wanting Armor found themselues too weake for the Cossacks: whereupon they retreated, &amp; were altogether appawled to be so disapointed, which whē <HI>Scander Bashaw</HI> perceiued, he tooke an opportunity of exprobrating their audatiousnes, and chiding their ostentation, whereas now they could performe nothing, which he did as some report to this or the like purpose.</P>
<P>Now, you that are so powerfull in insolency and tumults, and were so forward to the War, that we must either take the Field to spend your humors, and satisfie your impatience, or be taken by you, &amp; suffer the indignity of your outrages, what say you now to the Warre? what can you doe to these men? nay, what will you doe for the Emperors Honor, and your own reputation? well, seeing you see by experience, that the times are changed, and the discipline of Warre must take you out o∣ther lessons of fury, leaue your foolish finding fault with your friends: and spend your courages vpon your enemies? there is now no retiring by Mutinies, but setting forward vpon aduan∣tages, you must either force these Trenches, or be enforced to indure a slaughter: But I will now answer for you, what is past is remedilesse, we come to Fight, and I know, you are reso∣lute to play the men, therefore follow me, and I will leade you the way to death or Glory: wherupon without any reply, they came forward with 50000. and vnder the security of a rowling Trench gaue a braue Camizado on the <HI>Polonian</HI> Campe, with many pieces of Ordnance, which they mounted vpon prety bankes, as the Pyoners cast vp the earth before them.</P>
<P>But as they were in this forwardnes rhe Cossackes came so violently vpon the vnarmed <HI>Tartars,</HI> that they were subiect to
<PB REF="8"/> a great slaughter, so that both they and the Ianizaries were glad to retire with losse, and the young Emperor vnacquainted with the Warre, was yet acquainted with Oathes and Curses, to chide both himselfe and Fortune. At last the Bashawes seeing no remedy and finding so great obstacles of their attempts, pro∣iected the preseruation of the <HI>Emperors</HI> person; but it may be to secure their owne liues, &amp; so entrenched themselues, being (as they said) the first time that euer so great an Army of <HI>Turkes</HI> was enclosed within walles, by which occasion, necessity com∣peld them to confesse, they had new worke in hand, and that there was nothing so easie, as to cry to the warre, but nothing so difficult as to returne with Victory.</P>
<P>In this manner they lay all the Summer looking vpon one an∣other with reuengefull eyes, and taking the aduantage of so many Sallies, that the Turke lost at least in seuerall Skirmishes 50000. men: For many times they met about the seeking of Victuall, and there fought it out: many times they encountred in forraging, and getting prouision for their Horses: many times their courages were so exasperated, that with equall incoun∣ters and appointed Sallies they returned home againe, finding the issue nothing but slaughter and bloud, and many times they determined to deceiue one another by taking the Riuers and passing the Foords, which ended not without destruction, and perishing of whole Companies. As for set Battails, or one dayes tryall by equall agreement of both parties, it neuer came to so formidable a busines, or remarkable aduenture: and therefore I can but wonder at the shamelesse reports of strange men, and weake Certificates by <HI>Corantes</HI> from Foraine parts, especially to haue them Printed, to talke of so many Thousands slaine, the Prince kill'd, <HI>Sigismond</HI> defeated, and the whole Army put to flight, when yet as I said, there was neuer any such matter, nor any set Battaile fought.</P>
<P>Yet although the <HI>Polonians</HI> had rather the better, then the Turkes, they did not runne away so fast with prosperity, but they were subiect to many inconueniences, and they sawe plainely the warres were no May-games: For they endu∣<SUB>r</SUB>ed both Hunger and Colde, slacknes of payment, and <SUB>t</SUB>heir entertainment came many times short: The Noble</P>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<P>The noble Generall died in the Campe, the Prince lay sicke of a Feuer, their horse miscarried, and other lamenta∣ble effects taught them extraordinary patience, which made them attend good conditions of peace, and when they found they might be entertained, they were not scrupulous or thought it any desparagement to propose the same.</P>
<P>When the Bashawes were thus disappointed (especially <HI>Mehemet Bashaw</HI>) who was euer an enemy to the <HI>Moldauian</HI> busines, and that he saw the yong Emperour euery way dis∣contented, but especially with himselfe, as blaming his owne vnhappinesse, that hee should in the first triall of his manhood be so vnfortunate, as to open the doore of Chri∣stian apprehension; that the <HI>Othoman</HI> fame was now at the highest, and the Turkish Empire subiect to diminution: hee went another way to worke, and perswaded the yong Prince to make tryall of another time, and peace for the pre∣sent: nay he did talke of another countrey, to which when the Turke angerly replyed, he would die first, hee enforced the argument that it should be to his honour, and the <HI>Polack</HI> should seeke it with great mediation.</P>
<P>It is said, the yong Emperour shed teares, and was more a∣fraid of his disceputation among his souldiers, then glad of a∣ny pacification of the present troubles; yet necessitie had no law, and he was in the end compelled to the proposed com∣position. But how? By a polliticke contriuing the busines, and secret workings of more nimble spirits: for presently a Priest of <HI>Moldauia</HI> was set on worke to go among the <HI>Po∣lonians,</HI> and by way of generall complaint against the outra∣gious effects of warre, to enlarge the happinesse of peace, and inferre what a blessing it were to procure the same: whereupon hee was brought to the yong Prince of <HI>Poland,</HI> and commanders of the Army, with whom hee at last pre∣uailed so well, and so farre, that they sent a solemne Embassie to the great Turke, as he lay entrenched in the fields, to en∣treate a peace, and desire the renouation of the <HI>antiqua pucta,</HI> which had been euer betweene the two nations. The Turke had learnd his lesson so well, that hee seemed to make the
<PB N="12" REF="9"/> matter strange and of great humiliation, if he should consent thereunto, and rather a curtesie granted then a necessitie im∣posed, and so deferred them a while, till at last (as if he had bin ouer-wrought by the intercession and mediation of his Ba∣shawes) he was contented to capitulate the matter, and after many meetings, and a great deale of conference, articles were drawne, and confirmed with a kinde of solemnity, and pro∣claimed by sound of trumpet in both the campes.</P>
<P>But see the condition of men, and the inconueniences that great Emperours are subiect vnto? for all the <HI>Ianizaries</HI> themselues neither durst, nor could maintaine the warre any longer, and were indeed affronted with an ouer-mastring power, and an ouer-ruling discipline of warre: yet they ra∣ther complained of the Emperor, as being vnfortunate, then their owne cowardice, as being ouer-mated, and so brake vp the campe with a kinde of murmuring and repining. The great Turke tooke easie iourneys toward <HI>Andrinopolis,</HI> where he discharged the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and sent most of his <HI>Ianizaries</HI> be∣fore hand to <HI>Constantinople. Sigismond</HI> king of <HI>Poland</HI> raised his army, and rewarding the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> dismissed them home againe into their country: he went in person to <HI>Leopolis,</HI> from whence (by this time <HI>Osman</HI> was come to the great cittie) he sent a solemne Embassador to be there a Leiger, as it had bin in former times.</P>
<P>By Christmas <HI>Osman</HI> comes home, and had the accustomed acclamations of the people, with all the ceremonies of his re∣turne, whereupon he goes in great pompe to the <HI>Sophia,</HI> and had the vsefull guard of his Court <HI>Ianizaries</HI> to attend him: but within short space many fearefull accidents appalled them all, and such a mischiefe followed, as they could not example by any president. First, they were astonished at a blazing Comet, about which many men did raue in the in∣terpretation. Secondly, they were afrighted at a great fire hapning amongst the <HI>Iewes,</HI> which they presaged ominous to the gouernment. Thirdly, a sore earthquake made their hearts quake for feare: but this is so vsuall in those parts by reason of the ascending vp the hills, and many Cauerns vn∣der
<PB N="13" REF="9"/> ground, that they needed not haue made it, or taken it for any signe of displeasure. Fourthly, the Sea swelling extraordinarily, and the winde from the Southwest driuing the billowes into the corner of the harbour, made such a noyse and formidable sound, as catching the tackles of the ships and gallies in his whistling, that they were affraid euen of common accidents.</P>
<P>Last of all, and worst of all, by reason of the great con∣course of people, and resort of strangers, such a famine happe∣ned in the city, and dearth in the countrey, that euery one complained, and though it was remedilesse by the pollicy of man, yet was the fault layed vpon Superiours, and the Emperour himselfe did not escape scandall and calumnia∣tion.</P>
<P>For while the <HI>Ʋiceers</HI> and principall Officers endeuoured the common good, and studied the Weale publike, which could not be done, but by discharging the Citie of multi∣tudes of Inhabitants; all was interpreted to be done for their priuate wealth, and ambitious ouer-ruling of others: but when it came to the discharging of many <HI>Ianizaries</HI> and souldiers out of the Citie, to liue as it were in garrison in the Countrey, and that the Emperour was slacke in their Dona∣tiues, and former allowances out of his Treasurie; they stor∣med beyond measure, and threatened the <HI>Ʋiceers</HI> and <HI>Ba∣shawes</HI> to haue a better account of the Businesse; crying out, they would not be quiet, till they were imployed in one Seruice, or other. To this the <HI>Ʋiceer</HI> replyed, that hee wondered at their basenesse and audaciousnesse, that ha∣uing fayled in all their Enterprises, they durst yet com∣plaine of any accident, more then their owne cowardize. As for the satisfying of wilfull men, they would not vio∣late the Lawes of Nations, or infringe the contracted Peace with other Kingdomes, to appease the mutinies of turbulent spirits, who, if they might haue their owne demaunds, knew not what to demaund. As for your selues, what would you haue? you know the treasure is ex∣hausted,
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> &amp; the dearth is so great, that we haue not sufficient to buy vs bread: and for your murmuring and repinings a∣gainst the Maiestie of the Prince, as if he alone were branded with misfortune, or borne vnder some disastrous constella∣tion; how can this be, that with the same hands whereof you boast to vphold the Empire, you will presumptuously pull it in peeces; but I see the reason, this is for lacke of disci∣pline to make you know your selues, and so I cannot resem∣ble you better then vnto stinking weedes and nettles, which crushed hard, loose their force, and cannot hurt at all; but gently handled, will sting and endamage one.</P>
<P>Till this they were not much enraged, but now no flames could exaestuate more then fury and rauings: for they dared to condemne the Viceeres, and cryed out on their childish and vnfortunate Emperour, that hauing neither sufficient wit, nor courage to gouerne the State, must be ouer-ruled by such, as made pollicie, couetousnesse; and ambition, the supportation of their greatnesse, and the commanding voice to do what they list, without controule: yea such was the re∣fractary disobedienee of them at this time, that many offred to lay violent hands both on himselfe and his seruants, and had not the <HI>Haga</HI> or their Captaine come in to their pacifi∣cation, they had questionlesse begun a warre of mischiefe, and insolent trouble.</P>
<P>Well, they are quieted all this time; the suspition of fur∣ther vprores and mischiefes made the whole citty to stand vpon their guard, and euery Bashaw strengthned himselfe with as many friends as he could, and the Viceer for securi∣tie of the Emperor assembled the <HI>Chauses, Cappogies, Spahies,</HI> and <HI>Ianizaries</HI> of the Court to guard the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and watch the passages. Now you must consider that there hath been e∣uer enmity and emulation between these <HI>Ianizaries</HI> of the pallace and <HI>Ianizaries</HI> at large, whereupon when these vn∣derstood, that they were appointed for opposition, and saw plainly there was a deuise to single thē out, that so they might be brought in question for their mutinies: they resolued with <HI>Herostratus,</HI> that burnt the temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> to performe some
<PB N="15" REF="10"/> nefarious and notorious outrage, to be remembred to poste∣ritie, or be registred for an exorbitant action: and so in mul∣titudes past beleefe, they set vpon the Emperours <HI>Seraglio,</HI> broke open the yron Gates, dissipated the Guards, seized on the Women, tooke as many <HI>Bashawes</HI> as they could: but the chiefest reason why they offered this outrage, is as follow∣eth.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Osman</HI> hauing taken out of the Treasurie of seuen Towers a good quantitie of Gold, and being therewith pas∣sed ouer into <HI>Asia,</HI> with resolution to goe vnto <HI>Mecca:</HI> the great <HI>Mufti,</HI> his father in law, hauing laboured with all the greatest of the Court, whom it pleased not at all, that their Emperour being so young, should make so farre and long a Voyage; not being able to remoue him from his resolution, as hee desired, did in pollicy spread a rumour abroad, that the Emperour had taken so many Millions of Gold away with him, purposing therewith to make new Warres against his Enemies, notwithstanding the small satisfaction hee had giuen in the late Warres against <HI>Poland.</HI> Which comming to the vnderstanding of the <HI>Spahi</HI> and <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> they rise, and in a furie ranne vnto the Tower wherein <HI>Sultan Mu∣stapha</HI> was imprisoned, and taking him thereout, saluted him Emperour, who was lawfully elected by the father of <HI>Osman.</HI> This comming to the knowledge of the young Emperour, hee sent his <HI>Grand Ʋisier</HI> and the <HI>Aga</HI> of his <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> to appease the same, who were presently slaine by the souldiers in their furie. By which accident, the young Emperour, to remedie this disorder, being forced to come himselfe in per∣son, was instantly made prisoner, and brought to the pre∣sence of his vnckle <HI>Mustapha;</HI> who hauing framed Iudge∣ment against him, caused him to be carryed prisoner to the same Tower where hee himselfe had beene prisoner, and the night following to be strangled, with two of his sonnes but lately borne: Which was most inhumanely comman∣ded by <HI>Mustapha,</HI> his owne vnckle; who for the more se∣curitie, to keepe the Empire from another vsu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, caused it to be effected.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
<P>It is also written, that although hee condiscended to deli∣uer into their hands all the chiefe men they required, which were the principallest of the <HI>Ottomans</HI> Court, who afterward were all slaine with the sword; though hee proffered them great gifts, yea to encrease their stipends, and other prefer∣ments: all could not auayle, to asswage the anger of the souldiers.</P>
<P>It is further reported, that the Emperour had giuen in charge to the Keeper of the Tower, that hee should suffer <HI>Mustapha</HI> to die of hunger, to auoid those disgraces and ac∣cidents which since are befallen him: and it seemeth hee had alreadie sustained some want of foode; for so soone as hee came to be set at libertie by the people, hee presently cryed out for Water, saying, hee was ready to die of thirst, and that if hee had not come out of prison when hee did, hee presently had yeelded vp his life, being (as hee said) won∣derfully preserued by his God <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>When the young Emperour <HI>Osman</HI> was brought to his presence, hee kneeled on his knees, and craued pardon of him for his life, as heretofore <HI>Ottoman</HI> had done the like to him: but <HI>Mustapha</HI> answered, saying, that fauour I haue re∣ceiued commeth from heauen, and not from your hand.</P>
<P>Hee afterwards caused the Grand <HI>Mufti,</HI> the great Turkes vnckle, to be put to death, who had formerly bereaued him of so great an Empire, and made him a <HI>Masul,</HI> which is as much to say, as a man deposed from his Office. Hee placed in the roome of the dead Visier, <HI>Daut Pascias,</HI> a man of great wisedome, and one that had demeaned himselfe well in mat∣ters of greatest importance.</P>
<P>It is also said, that the death of the young Emperour is very ill taken by the souldiers, for they desired the death of none of them, but that they might be reconciled, and go∣uerne them as their naturall Lords and Princes, as they best could agree; and the rather, for that by reason of the death of the aforesaid <HI>Osman,</HI> the whole race of the <HI>Ottomans</HI> is ex∣tinguished, if the two children are put to death, as is reported, for that Sultan <HI>Mustapha,</HI> now Emperour, is held vnable for generation.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
<P>Others report, that Sultan <HI>Osman</HI> was not as yet gone ouer into <HI>Asia,</HI> but was vpon going, and that the <HI>Mufti</HI> and other his adherents not being able to remoue him from his resolution, did vse this but as a deuice to diuert him, casting this rumour among the people, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Spahi</HI> and the <HI>Iani∣zaries,</HI> as is aforesaid, which happened to his ruine, and a de∣clination and ending of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>To come to a conclusion; neuer was so violent an act so suddenly performed, nor so quickly repented: For the <HI>Iani∣zaries</HI> stood amazed at their owne villanie, &amp; by night there was not a man seene, that durst iustifie their treasons; for they fled for the present, no man knew whither, and those which remained, were afraid to stand for the glory of the House of <HI>Osman,</HI> but they would liue and die in the obedience of a worthy Emperor.</P>
<P>But how this vprore ceased, or tumult was appeased: what offendors bee taken, or how punished: what <HI>Bashawes</HI> bee slaine, or from whence others are admitted: by what meanes the Doctors of the Law came together againe, or whether they escaped; if you long to know, I long as much to informe you: which (if I may doe) I will doe, ac∣cording to the next Certificate that comes.</P>
