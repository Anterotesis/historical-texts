<HEAD>The Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> Described.</HEAD>
<P>The Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> at <HI>Ephesus</HI> was one of the Worlds Wonders; two hundred and twenty years were spent in the building of it: It was built upon a Marish to prevent hurt by Earthquakes, which were very common in those parts; the first foundation was laid upon Coals, the second upon Wooll; It was four hundred twenty and five foot long, and two hundred and twenty broad, there were in it one hun∣dred twenty and seven Pillars of Marble, sixty foot in height, and thirty six of them curiously wrought and engraven, the works of so many Kings. The doors of the Temple were of Cypress, which after four hundred years, were as fresh as if they had been new made; the roof was of Cedar: The Image, which superstition supposed to have come down from <HI>Jupiter,</HI> was made by one <HI>Canesia</HI>: some say of Ebonie, others of the Vine which had many holes made, and filled with Spikenard, the moisture whereof closed up the rifts. It was in∣riched and adorned with gifts beyond value. It was contrived by <HI>Ctesiphon,</HI> and was seven times fired, the last whereof was by <HI>Erostra∣tus,</HI> who did it to get himself a name: <HI>Herodo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doris</HI> was almost surrounded with the Sea, wherein was <HI>Gnidus,</HI> a City famous for the Marble Image of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Halycarnassus,</HI> famous for <HI>Herodotus,</HI> and <HI>Dionysius</HI> the Historians; and for <HI>Mausolus,</HI> whose Sepulchre erected by <HI>Artimesia</HI> his wife, and sister, was accounted one of the seven Wonders of the World.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and the Temple, as they were when they were destroyed by the <HI>Romans.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Hierusalem</HI> was compassed with a treble wall on every side, save only on that part where it was inclosed with inaccessible Vallies; for on that side it needed onely one wall: It was built upon two hils, the one opposite to the other, separated by a Valley, which was won∣derously replenished with houses. One of these Hills, whereon stood the upper part of the City, was far higher and steeper than the other; whereupon King <HI>David</HI> compassing it about with a Wall, called it the <HI>City of David.</HI> The other hill called <HI>Acra,</HI> was the place whereon the lower part of the City stood: And opposite to this <HI>Acra,</HI> was an∣other hill lower than it, which at first was divided from it by a large Valley; but when the <HI>Asmonians</HI> reigned, they filled up this Valley, and cut down the top of <HI>Acra,</HI> that it might not hide the Temple: within one of the vallies was <HI>Siloam,</HI> a Fountain sending forth abun∣dance of clear and sweet water: The outmost wall, by reason of the valley about it, and the Rock whereon it stood was impregnable, the rather, because besides the situation, it was built very strongly by <HI>David, Salomon,</HI> and other Kings. A fourth wall was begun by <HI>A∣grippa:</HI> In humane reason, had this wall been finished, the City could never have been taken: For hee began to build it with stones twenty cubits long, and ten cubits broad, so that it could neither bee easily undermined, nor battered with Engines: But hee built this wall but ten cubits high, and then fearing lest <HI>Claudius Caesar</HI> should think that hee had a purpose to Rebell, hee gave it over: Yet afterwards the Jews raised this wall twenty cubits high: made a Battlement two cu∣bits high, and the Tower three cubits, in all four and twenty cubits high: Besides, upon the wall were three Towers twenty cubits broad, and twenty cubits high, built four square, very strongly; with∣in these Towers were rooms for men to dwell in, and Cisterns to re∣ceive rain-water. The third wall had ninty of these Towers, and be∣tween every Tower were two hundred cubits space: The second wall had fourteen Towers; and the old wall had threescore, and the com∣passe of the whole City was three and thirty furlongs.</P>
<P>Between the North, and the West-part of the City, upon the out∣most wall, stood the Tower <HI>Psephina,</HI> which was raised threescore and ten cubits high; so that in a clear day a man might from thence disco∣ver
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<HI>Arabia,</HI> and the utmost confines of the Jews, even to the Sea. Just opposite to this was the Towe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Hippicos,</HI> built by <HI>Herod</HI> upon the old wall, which for bignesse, beauty, and strength, surpassed all others in the world: It had four corners, each of which was five and twenty cubits broad, as many long, and thirty cubits high, and in no place hollow: On the top was a Well to receive Rain-water, twenty cu∣bits deep. On the top of all were Houses five and twenty cubits high, divided into many rooms: Above them were battlements two cubits high, and Turrets three cubits high, so that in all it was fourscore and five cubits high.</P>
<P>Hee built also a second Tower, in breadth and length forty cubits, and as many high, in figure of a square pillar, all solid, and not hollow within: And above this, a Porch ten cubits high, adorned with Tur∣rets and Pinacles: Over the midst of this Porch hee built another Tow∣er, distinguished into goodly roomes, and sumptuous Baths; and on the top it was beautifyed with Turrets and Pinacles; so that the whole height was almost fourscore and ten cubits.</P>
<P>Lastly, Hee built a third Tower, which hee called after his Queens name, <HI>Mariamne,</HI> twenty cubits high, and twenty broad, all of solid stone, and not hollow, having more stately and magnificent lodgings in it than either of the former: It was in all fifty five cubits high.</P>
<P>These Towers, though they were very high, yet by reason of their situation they seemed far higher: For the old Wall whereon they were built stood upon a Rock that was thirty cubits high, whereby their height was much increased: They were not built also of ordina∣ry stone, but all of white Marble, whereof each stone was twenty cubits long, and ten cubits broad, and five cubits thick; and so curi∣ously joyned together that every Tower seemed but one stone; with∣in the City was the Kings Palace, surpassing all that can bee spoken of it, and for greatnesse, and curious workmanship, may bee compa∣red with any other in the world: It was invironed with a wall thirty cubits high, adorned with goodly Towers round about, Beautified with Houses for an hundred of the Nobility: The variety of the Marble wherewith it was built, was admirable, all sorts being there∣in used, though never so rare to bee found. In every room also were many vessels of gold, and silver, and many Porches round about, a∣dorned with most curious Pillars: There were in it very many plea∣sant walks, adorned with all sorts of Trees, and Gardens, beset with Fountains that spouted up water on high, and Cisterns beauti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed with many Brazen Statues, from which ranne out water continually.</P>

<HEAD>The Temple Described.</HEAD>
<P>The Temple was built upon a Rocky Mountain; the plain on the top whereof was at first scarce big enough for the Temple and Court, the hill being very steep: But the people every day bring∣ing earth thither, at last made it plain, and large enough, and inclosed the hill with a treble wall, which was a work passing all expectation; to the effecting whereof many Ages were spent, and all the holy trea∣sure offered to God from all parts of the world: The foundations of

The stones of it were forty cubits, The Porches were double, and every one was supported by many stately pillars, five and twenty cubits high, all of one peece of white Marble; the tops of them were of Cedar so exactly wrought, as astonished the beholders: These Porches were thirty Cubits broad, and the compass of all was six Fur∣longs. The Courts were curiously wrought, and paved with all sorts of stones.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The way to the inward Temple was all inclosed with stones, wrought like Lattice-work, which were three Cubits high, of curious workmanship: to this second there was an ascent by fourteen staires; and aloft it was four square, and enclosed with a wall by it self, whose outside being forty Cubits high, was all covered with stairs to ascend up to it, and within, it was twenty five Cubits high: At the top of the fourteen staires within the wall was a level, compassed with a wall of three hundred Cubits, which had eight Gates in it; and between the Gates were Porches opposite each to other, reaching from the wall to the Treasury, supported with great and stately Pil∣lars. All the gates were covered with Plates of gold, and silver, on∣ly one was covered with <HI>Corinthian</HI> brasse, which for beauty far excel∣led the other, dazling the eyes of the beholders: In every gate were two doores, each of them thirty Cubits high, and fifteen broad; and on each side they had seats thirty Cubits long, and forty Cubits high, each one supported with two Pillars, twelve Cubits thick: Only the gate which was covered with <HI>Corinthian</HI> brasse, was fifty Cu∣bits high, the gates were forty Cubits, and it was more richly adorned than the rest.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Holy of Holies was situated in the midst of all, and had twelve staires to go up to it. The forepart of it was an hundred Cubits high, and as many broad: Backward it was forty Cubits; on each side it had as it were two shoulders rising up in height twenty Cubits: The first gate was seventy Cubits high, and five and twenty wide, and had no doores, to shew that Heaven was alwayes open, &amp;c.

The Kings Pallace joyns to the West side of it, possessing a large quantity of ground backward, though to the street side it hath no magnifick front; her best bravery being in the trim pargetting and painting with Azure and Gold, in Mosaick and Antick sort, interlaced with Poesies of <HI>Arabick:</HI> But within, the rooms are arched, en∣lightened with curious trellizes: the roof embossed with red, white, blew, and gold, the sides with sports, and painted Images: the ground spread with rich and curious Carpets of Silk and Gold.

The Wildernesse behinde is filled with all sorts of birds, priviledged from hurt, or affrights, who return their thanks in a sweet melodious consort. The North Isle of the Midan, contains eight or nine arched rooms, hung with Lamps and Candle∣sticks, which being lighted, gives a curious splendor.</P>
<P>Opposite to this Pallace is a fair Mosque, in form round, and within distinguished into Isles; the walls are lined fifteen foot high from the ground with white, and well polisht Marble, without pews or seats: In the midst is a stately Tank, or Pond, and at the Por∣tal another eightsquare, filled with Christal streams of water, where∣in all <HI>Musslemen</HI> wash their hands, armes, eyes, &amp;c. as an operative work to purge sin, and confer devotion.</P>

In the Center is a spacious Tank, made into twelve equal sides, each side being five foot, set round with pipes of lead, which spout out water in variety of conceits and postures, which sort of pastime continues thence to the North gate, where is raised a house of pleasure, antickly garnished without, within divided into four or six Chambers: the lower is set out with Tanks of rich white Marble, and fumes out a cool Breese: the higher rooms are garnished with variety of Land∣skips, representing their sports of hunting, hawking, fishing, riding, shooting, wrestling, and other fancies: the seeling is inriched with beaten gold, imbost with Azure.

In the first there is the Image of a man of gold, very great, and on his head a Crown of gold, set with most rare Rubies, and Saphires, and round about him are four little Children of gold. In the second there is the statue of a man of silver, sitting on heaps of money, whose stature in height as he sits is higher than the roof of an house: I measured one of his feet (saith mine Author) and it was as long as all my body, with a Crown on his head like the first.

Nor can any thing in the World seem more plea∣sant, than from the Lake to have such a prospect, the City so fully pre∣senting it self to the eye, with so many Temples, Monasterys, Pala∣ces, Gardens with high trees, Barges, People, &amp;c. For their man∣ner is to work one part of the day, and the other part to spend in so∣lace with their friends, or with women on the Lake, or in riding in Cha∣riots up and down the City. All the streets are paved with stone, as are all the high wayes in <HI>China:</HI> The principal street of <HI>Quinsay</HI> is pa∣ved ten paces on each side, and in the midst it's well gravelled with pas∣sages for the water, which keeps it alwayes clean: There are also mul∣titudes of Chariots, accommodated with cloathes, and cushions of Silk, for six persons in each of them; and in them the inhabitants solace themselves in the streets, or go to Gardens provided on purpose for their pleasure. This City contains about sixteen hundred thousand housholds, and together with the Country adjoyning, yeelded to the King sixteen millions, and eight hundred thousand Ducats of gold yearly, besides six millions, and four hundred thousand Ducats for the customes of salt. <HI>Pur.

For three months they have abundance of rain, with much thunder, and lighte∣ning: the other nine months so clear, that a cloud is scarce to bee seen.</P>
<P>The Country is beautified with many woods, and great variety of fair goodly trees, some having leaves as big as bucklers, others parted small as Fern, as the <HI>Tamarine</HI> trees that bear a sower fruit; somewhat like our Beans, very good to cool, and cleanse the blood: all their trees are green all the year about. There are rare flowers of admirable colours, but few of them sweet, save their Roses, and two or three more sorts.</P>
<P>The Country is watered with many goodly Rivers, especially <HI>In∣dus,</HI> and <HI>Ganges</HI>; besides which, they have store of springs, upon many of which they bestow great cost of stonework, making Tanks, or Ponds, some of them a mile in compasse, others more, surroun∣ded with stone walls, and within them fair stone steps round about. Some of them are filled with rain water. They have a strong drink called Rack, distilled from Sugar, and the spicie rind of a tree called <HI>Jagra</HI>: they have also Cohha made with a black seed boiled in water, that helps digestion, quickens the spirits, cleanses the blood, and provokes lust. Many of their houses are flat on the top, on which in the cool seasons of the day, they take the cool air: they have no chimnies, using no fire, but only to dresse their meat. The upper rooms have many lights to let in air, but they use no glasse: Amongst their houses are many fair trees, which are a great defence against the Sun. Most of their houses in the Cities are of Brick, or stone, well squared. Their staple commodities are Indico, and Cotton-wool, of which they make diverse sorts of cloth, some finer, and pu∣rer than our best Lawns: some of it they staine in variety of curious figures. They have also store of Silk, which they weave curiously, sometimes with gold, and silver, whereof they make Velvets. Sattens, and Taffaties, but not so good as in <HI>Italie.</HI> They have store of Drugs, and Gums, especially <HI>Gum-Lac,</HI> of which wee make hard wax.

which yet they need not open, having so much brought out of all other Countries. They have curious Gardens, planted with fruitfull trees, and dainty flowers, which never fade: in which they have fountains to Bathe in, and other water works for delight.

<P>The Wind, called the <HI>Monson</HI> blows six months Southerly, and six months Northerly, seldome varying: <HI>April, May,</HI> and the begin∣ning of <HI>June,</HI> till the Rains fall, are exceeding hot: Thus hath the wise disposer of all things tempered bitter things with sweet, to teach us that there is no true, and perfect content in any Kingdome, but that of heaven.</P>
<P>They have store of good Horses, and Camels, Dromedaries, Mules; Asses, Rhynocerots; which are as long as the fairest Oxe in <HI>England,</HI> their skines lye plaited in wrinkles on their backs. They have many Elephants, their King having usually fourteen thousand, and many of the Nobles a hunded a peece: There are some of them fifteen foot high, all of them black, their skin thick, and smooth, without hair: they take much delight in the water, and will swim excellent well, they are exceeding docible, so that they will do almost any thing the keeper bids them: If he would have them affright a man; he will make towards him as if hee would tread him in peeces, and yet when hee comes to him, not touch him. If hee bid him abuse a man, hee will take dirt, or kennel water in his trunk, and dash it in his face; &amp;c. They are most sure of foot, never stumbling: they are governed with a hook of steel, with which their keeper sitting on their Necks, pull them back, or prick them forward at their pleasure.

<HEAD>The Inhabitants of <HI>Indostan</HI> Described.</HEAD>
<P>The Inhabitants before they were conquered by <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> were all <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but now they are mixed with <HI>Mahometans:</HI> they are of stature, like us, very streight, seldome or never is there a crooked person amongst them: They are of an Olive colour, have black hair, but not curled; they love not any that are white, saying that they are like Lepers, their chins are bare, but have long hair on their upper lips, shave their heads; only reserve a lock on the Crown for <HI>Mahomet</HI> to pull them to heaven by. The habits of men and women differ little, mostly made of white Cotton cloth, made close to the middle, then hanging loose down below the knee: under them they have long breeches reach∣ing to the ancle, and close to their bodies: their feet are bare in their shooes, which they commonly wear like Slippers, which they put off when they come into their houses, whose floores are covered with excellent Carpets, upon which they sit when they talk or eat, like Taylors on their shop boards: on the mens heads are shashes, which is a long thin wreath of cloath, white or coloured. The <HI>Mahometan</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>
women cover their heads with vails, their hair hangs down behind twist∣ed with silk: oft bedecked with jewels, about their necks and wrists: their ears have pendants: their nostrils pierced to put in rings at their plea∣sure: Their ease in child bearing is admirable: for it is a common thing there, for women great with child, one day to ride carrying their Infants in their bodies, and the next day to ride carrying them in their arms.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Mogol,</HI> every year at the entring of the Sun into <HI>Aries,</HI> makes a feast to his Nobles which lasts nine days, at which time they present him with gifts, and he again repays them with Princely rewards: I was astonished (saith mine Author, who was an eye witnesse of it) when I beheld at that time the incredible riches of gold, pearls, Pretious stones, jewels, and many other glittering vanities which were amongst them.</P>
<P>The walls in the Kings house are painted, or beautified with pure white Lime: the floores are covered with rich, and costly Carpets: there lodge none with him in his house but his Eunuches, and women, and some little boys, that hee keeps for detestable uses: hee always eats in private amongst his women, upon great variety of excellent di∣shes, which being prepared, and proved by the Taster, are served up in vessels of Gold covered, and sealed up, and so by the Eunuches brought to him.</P>
<P>In this Empire there are no Inns to entertain strangers, onely in great Towns are fair houses built for their receit, which they call <HI>Sarrays,</HI> not inhabited, where Travellers have room freely, but they must bring with them beds, food, and other necessaries which they usually carry upon Camells, or in Carts drawn with Oxen, wherein they have tents to pitch when they meet with no <HI>Sarray's.</HI></P>
<P>The inferior sort of people ride upon Oxen, Horses, Mules, Camels, or Dromedaries, and the women like unto the men, or else in slight Coaches drawn with Oxen, many whereof are white and large, and they are guided with cords, which go through the parting of their Nostrils, and so betwixt their horns, into the Coach-mans hands: they are nimble, and will go twenty miles a day. The better sort ride up∣on Elephants, or are carried on mens shoulders in Sedans, which they call <HI>Palankeenes.</HI></P>
<P>In all their great Cities they have Markets twice a day, early in the morning, and in the evening; wherein they sell almost every thing by weight. They are generally so superstitious, that they will rather dye than eat, or drink any thing that their Law forbids.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Egyptian</HI> Pyramids Described.</HEAD>
<P>In <HI>Egypt</HI> are diverse stupendious structures called <HI>Pyramids,</HI> the greatest whereof is situated on the top of a rocky hill, which riseth a∣bove the plain about an hundred feet, with a gentle, and easy ascent, the height of the situation adding beauty to the work, and the solidi∣ty of the rock giving the superstructure a permanent, and stable sup∣port: each side of this <HI>Pyramid</HI> is six hundred ninety three feet accord∣ing to the <HI>English</HI> Standard; so that the whole <HI>Basis</HI> contains four hundred eighty thousand two hundred, and fourty nine square feet, or eleven <HI>English</HI> acres of ground. The height is the same with the breadth: <HI>viz.</HI> six hundred ninety three feet.</P>
<P>The ascent to the top is contrived in this manner: From all the
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>
sides without, the ascent is by degrees; the lowermost step or degree is about four foot in height, and three in breadth, which running a∣bout the <HI>Pyramid</HI> in a level, makes on every side of it a long, but nar∣row walk; the second row is like the first, retiring inward from the first three feet, and so runs about the <HI>Pyramid.</HI> In the same man∣ner is the third row placed above the second, and so in order the rest like so many stairs rising one above another to the top, which con∣tains about nine foot square. The degrees by which men ascend are not all of an equal depth, for some are about four foot, others scarcely three, and the higher they ascend, the more they diminish, both in breadth, and thicknesse: so that a right line extended from any part of the <HI>Basis</HI> to the top, will equally touch the outward angle of eve∣ry degree.</P>
<P>These are all made of Massie, and polished stones, hewn out of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Mountains, which bound the upper part of <HI>Egypt,</HI> being so vast, that the breadth and depth of every step, is one single and in∣tire stone, so that in most of them is contained thirty feet of stone: The number of these steps is two hundred and seven.</P>
<P>On the North side ascending thirty eight feet upon an artificial bank of earth, there is a square, and narrow passage, leading into the inside of this <HI>Pyramid,</HI> containing in length ninety two feet, and an half: The structure of it hath been the labour of an exquisite hand, as appears by the smoothnesse and evennesse of the work, and by the close knitting of the joynts: it is now an habitation for great ugly batts of about a foot long.</P>
<P>At the end of this entrance you must climb up a massy stone, eight or nine foot in height, where you enter into a Gallery, the pave∣ment consisting of smooth, and polished white Marble▪ the breadth is about five foot, and the height the like: the length of this Gallery is an hundred, and ten feet: At the end whereof begins a second Gallery, a very stately peece of work, and not inferiour either in respect of the curiousity of Art, or richnesse of materials, to the most sumptuous or magnificent buildings: Its divided from the for∣mer by a wall; at the end whereof is a Well about three feet in the dia∣meter, the sides whereof are lined with white Marble, its eighty six cubits in depth, hewn through the Rock on which the <HI>Pyramid</HI> stands▪ Beyond the Well about fifteen foot is a square passage, the stones whereof are exceeding massie, and exquisitely joyned, which contains one hundred and ten feet, at the end whereof is an arched Vault, or little Chamber; the length about twenty feet, the breadth seven∣teen, the height about fifteen.</P>
<P>The length of this second Gallery before mentioned is one hundred fifty and four feet, of white, and polished Marble, both roof, walls, and bottome; the joynts are so well knit, that they are scarce discernable: The height of this Gallery is twenty six feet, the breadth six feet, bounded on both sides with two banks, like benches of polished Marble.</P>
<P>At the end of this Gallery you enter into a square hole which brings you into a little room lined with rich, and speckled <HI>Thebaick</HI>

Marble, out of which through another passage, being all of <HI>Thebaick</HI> Marble; most exquisitely cut, you land at the North end of a very sumptuous, and well proportioned room, wherein Art seems to con∣tend with Nature, the curious work not being inferiour to the rich ma∣terials: It stands in the heart, or center of the <HI>Pyramid,</HI> equidistant from all the sides, and in the midst between the <HI>Basis,</HI> and the top: The floor, sides, and roof, are all made of vast, and exquisite tables of <HI>Thebaick</HI> Marble: from the top to the bottome are but six ranges of stone, all of an equal height. The stones which cover this room are of a strange, and stupendious length, like so many huge beams ly∣ing flat, and traversing the room, and bearing up that infinite weight, and Masse of the <HI>Pyramid</HI> above. Of these there are nine which co∣ver the roof; the length of this room is thirty four <HI>English</HI> feet: the breadth somewhat above seventeen feet, the height nineteen feet and a half.</P>
<P>In the midst of this glorious room stands the Tomb of <HI>Cheops</HI> of one peece of Marble, hollow within, and sounding like a bell; but emp∣ty: For (saith <HI>Diodorus</HI>) although the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Kings intended these for their Sepulchres, yet it happened that they were not buried there∣in: For the people being exasperated against them, by reason of the toilsomenesse of these works, and for their cruelty, and oppression, threatned to tear in peeces their dead bodies, and with ignominy to throw them out of their Sepulchres, wherefore the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commanded their friends when they were dead to bury them in some obscure place. The Tomb is cut smooth, and plain, without any sculpture, and ingraving: The outsides contain in length seven foot, three inches, and a half. In depth its three foot, and almost four inches, and the same in breadth: The hollow part within is something more than six foot long, the depth is somewhat above two feet; whereby it appears that mens bodies are now as big as they were three thousand years ago: For it is almost so long since this Tomb was made. This Pyra∣mid was twenty years in making, and yet there were three hundred threescore, and six thousand men continually working about it, who only in Radishes, Garlick; and Onions are said to have consumed eighteen hundred Talents. <HI>Collected out of Mr.</HI> Greaves, <HI>a curious obser∣ver of it.</HI></P>

<P>The benefit of it to the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and the wisdome of the King cannot bee sufficiently commended: For seeing the rising of <HI>Nilus</HI> is not alwayes alike, and the Country is more fruitful by the mode∣ratenesse thereof: Hee digged this Lake to receive the superfluity of the water, that neither by the greatnesse of the inundation, it should cause Marshes, or by the scarcity of water, the earth should not yeeld her strength, hee therefore cut a ditch from the River to this Lake fourscore furlongs long, and three hundred feet in breadth, by which sometimes receiving in, and sometimes diverting the River, hee gave at his pleasure a sufficient quantity of water to the husbandmen. Af∣ter the Kings name, its called the Lake of <HI>Maeris.</HI></P>
<P>In the midst of this Lake hee built a Sepulchre, and two Pyra∣mids, each of them of an hundred fathoms high, placing upon them two Marble statues, sitting on a Throne, one representing himself, the other his wife; seeking hereby to make his memory immortal. The revenews which came by the fish of this Lake, hee gave to his wife to buy her unguents, and ornaments, which was so great, that it amoun∣ted to a Talent a day: For it was mightily replenished with fish of twenty sorts, so that very many were continually imployed in catch∣ing, and salting of them. <HI>Diod.

The buildings are of Mosaick-work, with fine bricks, and stones framed after a most curious manner, lovely for delight, and stately for admiration. The roofes of the houses are adorned with Gold, Azure, and other excellent colours: on the top they are flat for the Inhabitants use and pleasure: within they are richly furnished, every Chamber having in it a Presse curiously painted, and varnished. The Portals, Pillars, Cisterns, and other Ornaments of the City are very exquisitly framed: There are of Temples in it a∣bout seven hundred, whereof fifty are very great, and fair, adorned with Marble Pillars, and other Ornaments, the Chapiters whereof are wrought with Mosaick and carved works: each of them hath his Fountain of Marble, and other costly stones: the floores are cove∣red with Mats closely joyned; the walls also for a mans height are lined with the same; every Temple hath its Steeple after the <HI>Ma∣hometan</HI> manner, whereon their Priests call the People to prayer at the appointed hours. The principal Temple is that of <HI>Caruven,</HI> so great, that it contains in circuit a mile, and a half. It hath thirty one Gates great and high: the Roof is one hundred and fifty <HI>Tuscan</HI> yards long, and neer fourscore broad.

<P>In the City there are two Principal, and most stately Colledges, adorned with Mosaick, and carved works, paved with Marble, and stones of <HI>Majorca</HI>; in each of them are many Chambers: One of them containing above one hundred Chambers, is adorned with a goodly Fountain of Marble, and a continuall running stream: about it are three Cloisters, or Galleries of incredible beauty, supported with eight square

Pillars of diverse colours: the Arches adorned with Mosaick of Gold, and Azure: the roof of carved work. The Gates of the Colledge are of Brass finely wrought, and the Chamber doors are well carved. In the great hall where they say their Prayers, is a Pulpit, ascended by nine stairs, all of Ivory, and Ebony.</P>
<P>There are many Hospitals in <HI>Fesse</HI> not inferior to the Colledges for building: there are also a hundred Bath-stoves well built, each of them having four Halls, and certain Galleries without; in which they put off their cloaths, most of them pertaining to the Temples, and Col∣ledges, and yeilding them a great rent.</P>
<P>Their Inns are almost two hundred, built three stories high, each of them having one hundred and twenty Chambers in them, with Galleries before all the doors: but yeilding neither beds, nor food for strangers.

<P>At the Cape of <HI>Good Hope:</HI> the <HI>Africans</HI> are ugly black, strong-limmed, desperate, crafty, and injurious. Their heads are long, their hair woolly, and crispt; of which some shave one side, leaving the other long, and curled: Another shaves all, saving a little tuft on the top: Another (thinking his invention better) shaves here, and there, the bald skull appearing in many places: other some shave away all save a lock before. Such as have tufts of hair, hang in them brasse but∣tons, spur rowels, peeces of Pewter, &amp;c. Their ears are long, and made longer by heavy bables they hang in them, as links of brass, or I∣ron, chains, glass-beads, blew-stones, bullets, or Oister-shels: and such as cannot reach to such Jewels, have singles of Dear, beaks of birds, Dogs or Cat stones, &amp;c. Their Noses are flat, crusht so in their infan∣cy, their Lips great: quick, crafty eyes: and about their necks they have guts, or raw puddings, serving both for good and Orna∣ment: The better sort instead of them get hoops of Iron, chains of brasse, or greazy thongs of stinking Leather: Their arms are loaden with voluntary shackles of Iron, Ivory, rusty brass, or musty Copper: the rest of their bodies are naked, saving that they are girded with a thong of raw Leather, to which is fastened, a square peece like the back

of a Glove to cover their privities: but the women, when they re∣ceive any thing, return their gratitude by taking up that slap, and dis∣covering their shame: But their great ones have better cloathing: A nasty untanned hide of a Lyon, Leopard, Calf, Baboon, or Sheep (the hair inward) which they put upon their shoulders, reaching to their wasts: for their thighs and legs are never covered: To their feet is fastened a broad peece of Leather, tyed by a little strap, which for the most part they hold in their hands, that their feet may have liberty to steal, which with their toes, they can do most cunningly, all the while looking you in the face, as if they meant no harm. Most of the men are semi-Eunuches, one stone being exsected in their infan∣cy by their nurses. Both sexes hideously cut, gash, and pink their brows, nose, cheeks, arms, breast, back, belly, thighs, and legs in sundry works, and Figures. They have no houses, they delight most in Caves, Holes, or Lyons dens, unfurnished; a whole Tribe com∣monly keeping together, coupling without distinction, the name of wife, or brother, being unknown amongst these incestuous per∣sons.</P>
<P>They feed, sleep, and speak altogether without order, or Law: In the night they sleep round a fire, a Centinel watching the Lyons, their adversaries: <HI>Vivitur ex rapto</HI>: the one eating the other, the Ly∣on tearing some of them, and they other times training him over co∣vered pits, which catches him: and so they slay, and eat him to day, who perhaps was a Sepulcher to their friends, or parents the day be∣fore. They dawb, and rub their skins with grease, and coals, inden∣ting, and drying them in the Sun whereby they become Monsters to all civil eyes. They eat men alive, or dead, which when they fail of, dead Whales, Seals, Pengwins, grease, or raw puddings are their diet: and when the frost of old age benums their limbs, whereby they are unapt to provide their own food, they either eat them, or expose them upon the Mountains, either to bee killed by famine, or de∣voured by Lyons.</P>
<Q><L>With these no violent death, nor stroying rage</L>

The women carry their children on their backs, and give suck with their long dugs stretched over their shoulders. <HI>Anno Christi.</HI> 1600. Sir <HI>James Lancaster</HI> had a∣mongst them a thousand sheep, and fifty Oxen for trifles.

<P>The <HI>Abassine</HI> soil is for the most part hollow, and in the midst of the plains, rise many Rockie-hills, which in times of war serve them for Fortresses: The whole Country abounds with Mettal-Mines; but the inhabitants, partly through ignorance, and partly for fear of the <HI>Turks,</HI> if the riches of their Country should bee discovered, suffer them to lye hidden in the earth, only they make use of so much Iron as lyes upon the surface of the earth.

The boys marry at ten, and the maids at twelve years old. They know no Letters: <HI>Nihil scire, nil jucundi∣us.</HI> The earth is rich in Minerals, Gold, Silver, Iron, Copper, &amp;c. but hearing of the cruelty, and covetousnesse of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> they prohibit the diging of them.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Euboea,</HI> over against <HI>Chios,</HI> now called <HI>Negropont,</HI> is in com∣passe three hundred sixty five miles: A very fruitful Island; between the continent and it, is only a little <HI>Euripus</HI> that ebbs and flowes seven times in one day, the reason whereof, when <HI>Aristotle</HI> could not finde out, hee threw himself into it, saying, <HI>Quia ego non capio te, tu capis me</HI>: In it are two Rivers, <HI>Cireus,</HI> and <HI>Nileus: Strabo</HI> saith, that if sheep drink of the former, their wooll turns white; if on the latter, coal black.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sporades</HI> are twelve in number, the chiefest is <HI>Milo</HI>: fourscore miles in circuit; the soil is fruitful of grain, and oil: Here is excel∣lent Marble, curiously spotted: pitch and brimstone, and hot springs good for many diseases.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cyclades</HI> are in number three and fifty, the chiefest are. 1. <HI>De∣los,</HI> wherein they had a custome not to suffer men to dye, nor chil∣dren to bee born in it, sending their sick men, and great bellied wo∣men to <HI>Rhena,</HI> a small Island hard by▪ 2 <HI>Samos,</HI> where the Tyrant <HI>Polycrates</HI> lived, who, because hee never had any mischance, threw a Ring that hee loved dearly, into the Sea; but shortly after, hee found it in the belly of a fish that was brought to his Table: yet was hee at length brought to a miserable death by <HI>Orontes,</HI> a <HI>Persian,</HI> shewing the instability of all earthly things. 3. <HI>Patmos,</HI> whither St. <HI>John</HI> was banished by the Emperor <HI>Domitian,</HI> and where hee had his <HI>Revela∣tions.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Cretan</HI> Seas are. 1. <HI>Crete,</HI> in compasse five hundred and nine∣ty miles, in length two hundred and seventy, in breadth, fifty: the soil is fruitful, especially of Wines called <HI>Muskadels</HI>: it yeelds also Su∣gar-Candie, Gums, Hony, Sugar, Olives, Dates, Apples, Orenges, Lemons, Raisons, Citrons, and Pomegranats, yet it wants Corn.

the parts of a <HI>French</HI> woman from the girdle to the shoulders, over which must bee placed an <HI>English</HI> face.

<P>The Diet of <HI>England</HI> is for the most part flesh: In <HI>London</HI> alone there are slain and uttered, no fewer than sixty seven thousand and five hundred beefes, and six hundred seventy five thousand sheep, besides Calves, Lambs, Swine, and Poultry, in a year: I beleeve now farre more: The <HI>Spanish Gondamor</HI> when hee was here, having often seen our Shambles, said that there was more flesh here eaten in a month, than in all <HI>Spain</HI> in a year.

<P>Our Navy is called the walls of <HI>England,</HI> the like ships for ser∣vice are not to bee found in the World, and our Marriners, and Soul∣diers are not to bee equalled. In King <HI>Edward</HI> the third his time two hundred of our ships neer <HI>Scluse</HI> overcame four hundred of the <HI>French:</HI> of which they sunk two hundred sail, and slew thirty thousand Soul∣diers. In eighty eight a few of our Queens ships overthrew the <HI>Spa∣nish Invincible Armado,</HI> consisting of one hundred thirty and four great Gallions: Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> with four ships, took from the <HI>Spaniard</HI> one million, and one hundred eighty nine thousand, and two hundred Duckats in his voyage <HI>Anno Christi.</HI> 1587. And again, with five and twenty ships hee awed the Ocean, sacked St. <HI>Jago, Domin∣go,</HI> and <HI>Carthagena,</HI> bringing away with him besides much treasure, two hundred and forty peeces of Ordnance. Our Country men <HI>Drake,</HI> and <HI>Cavendish</HI> have sailed round about the World. I omit the voyage to <HI>Cales</HI> mentioned before. Sir <HI>Richard Creenvil</HI> in one of the Queens ships called the <HI>Revenge,</HI> wherein were but one hundred and fourscore Souldiers, and of them ninety so sick as not able to fight, yet maintained hee a Sea-fight for four and twenty hours a∣gainst above fifty of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gallions, and though when his powder was spent to the last barrel, hee yeilded on honorable tearms, yet before, he had killed one thousand of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and sunk four of their greatest vessels. And what victories wee have had of late over all the Navies of the <HI>Lowcountries,</HI> I omit to speak of, because they are fresh in every ones memory. In land service our souldiers are able to endure, and resolute to undertake the hardest enterprises: witnesse our warres, and conquests in <HI>Spain, France, Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands</HI> assisted by us.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> is a most fertile, and a most potent Island, as well for si∣tuation, as for men and ships: and the Inhabitants are good souldiers both by sea and land, in valour and courage, not inferior to any one Nation whatsoever, and are more apt to offend by temerity, and o∣vermuch forwardnesse, than by cowardize, It excells all other na∣tions in Mastiffs, Cocks of the Game, and Women, who are incom∣parably beautiful, and therefore have great influence upon the men: yea the Queens have commanded here more absolutely, and have been much better obeyed and respected, than the Kings.</P>
<P>The division of <HI>England</HI> is into forty shires, and nine thousand seven hundred and twenty five Parishes, beside Chappels: In these are five hundred fourscore and five Market Towns, besides Cities: the chief are <HI>Shrewsbury, Northampton, South-hampton, Lecester, Warwick,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Our Universities are two, <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> which for num∣ber, and beauty of Colledges, multitudes of Students, and largeness of revenues, are not to bee equalled in the Christian world.

<P>In several places of <HI>England</HI> there is excellent white salt made: I

In some other places they boil it in Iron pans with coals, but they say the salt is not so white.</P>

<HEAD>The Cities in <HI>England</HI> Described. The City of <HI>London</HI> Described.</HEAD>
<P>No Records set down the Original of this ancient City. A City it was when <HI>Caesar</HI> first entred <HI>Brittain,</HI> and by the Testimony of <HI>Ta∣citus, Ptolemy,</HI> and <HI>Antonine,</HI> was called <HI>Londinium,</HI> and by <HI>Ammia∣nus Marcellinus,</HI> for her successive prosperity, <HI>Augusta,</HI> the greatest title that can bee given to any. In regard of both elements it is most happy, as being situate in a most rich, and fertile soil, abounding with plenty, and store of all things, and on the gentle ascent, and rising of a hill hard by the <HI>Thames</HI> side, which by his safe and deep chan∣nel is able to entertain the greatest ships, which daily bring in such store of rich Merchandise from all parts of the VVorld, that it striv∣eth at this day with the Mart towns in Christendome for the second place, and affordeth a most sure, and beautiful rode for shipping. This City doth shew her self as the Cedar amongst shrubs: It was the seat of the British Kings, and is the model of the Land, and Mart of the World: For thither are brought the Silks of <HI>Asia,</HI> the Spices of <HI>A∣frica,</HI> the Balms from <HI>Grecia,</HI> and the Riches from both the <HI>Indies.</HI> No City hath been so long famous, nor in civil Government can bee compared with her. Her walls were first built by <HI>Constantine</HI> the great, at the request of his mother <HI>Helena,</HI> reared with rough stone, and british brick, three <HI>English</HI> miles in compass: through which are seven fair Gates, besides posterns. A long the <HI>Thames</HI> this wall at first ranged with gates, the one <HI>Douregate,</HI> now <HI>Dowgate,</HI> the other <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> a receptacle for ships. In the middest of the City was set a mile mark (as the like was in <HI>Rome</HI> also) from whence they mea∣sured their stations, which stands till this day, and is commonly known by the name of <HI>London stone.</HI> St. <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Cornhill</HI> is thought to have been the Cathedral of <HI>Restitutus,</HI> a Christian Bishop in <HI>Constantine</HI> the great's time, which was afterwards removed to St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> whose greatness exceeds all others, and spires had so high that twice they were consumed by lightning from heaven: It hath in it besides this Church, one hundred twenty and one Churches more, viz. ninety and six within the walls, and sixteen without, but within the liberties, and nine more in her suburbs. Its divided into six and twenty Wards, governed by so many Aldermen, a Lord Maior, and two Sheriffs, the yearly
<PB N="85" REF="50"/>
choice whereof was granted them by Patent from King <HI>John</HI>: In whose time also a Bridge of stone was built over the <HI>Thames</HI> upon twenty Arches, built of excellent freestone, and each Arch being sixty foot high, and full twenty in distance from one another; so that for length, breadth, beauty, and building, the like is not again to be found in the world.</P>
<P>King <HI>John</HI> gave certain void places in <HI>London</HI> to the City to build upon, and the profits thereof were to go toward the charges of building and repairing the same bridg: and the Mason who was the chief wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kman in building it, erected a large chappel upon it, at his own charges, and largely endowed it, which is since turned to a dwelling house. It was fi∣nished <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1209. having been thirty and three years in build∣ing. Afterwards sundry beautiful houses were built upon it, that it seems a street rather than a bridge, and many charitable men have giv∣en lands, houses, and summes of money towards the maintenance of it.</P>
<P>At the East end of this City standeth the Tower: A most famous and goodly Citadel, encompassed round with thick, and strong walls full of lofty and stately Turrets, fenced with a broad and deep moat, furnished with a gallant Magazine of warlick Ammunition, and other buildings besides, so that it resembles a big town.</P>
<P>Concerning the Church of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> an ancient writer saith, that it contains in length six hundred and ninety feet, the breadth thereof is one hundred and thirty foot; the height of the West arched roof from the ground is one hundred and two foot, and the new fabrick from the ground is eighty eight foot high. The stone work of the steeple, from the plain ground rose in height two hundred and sixty foot, and the Timber frame upon the same was two hundred seven∣ty and four foot high, the Spire before it was burnt down, was five hundred thirty and four foot high. About the time of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, when Musters were made of able men to bear arms, <HI>London</HI> brought into the field under their colours forty thousand foot men, and twenty thousand horsemen. It hath often, and is daily enlarged with new buildings, and spacious Suburbs stretched forth from the Gates a great length on every side, but Westward especially, which are the great∣est, and best peopled: In which are twelve Inns for students of the Common Law. The four principal houses are the <HI>Inner Temple,</HI> the <HI>middle Temple, Grates Inn,</HI> and <HI>Lincolns Inn</HI>: six smaller belong to the Chancery: besides two Inns more for the Sergeants at Law.</P>
<P>These Western Suburbs are so carried on, that they joyn to <HI>London</HI> another City called <HI>Westminster,</HI> famous for the Seat, and Sepulchre of our Kings, and for the Courts of justice kept every Tearm in <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall. No walls are built about this City: and those of <HI>London</HI> are left to shew rather what it was, than what it is: whose Citizens, as the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> did, do repute their strength to consist in their men, and not in their walls. In the City of <HI>West∣minster</HI> along by the <HI>Thames</HI> side, are many stately buildings for the

Nobles, and great men of the Land, as <HI>Essex</HI> house, <HI>Arundel</HI> house, <HI>Summerset</HI> house, &amp;c. The <HI>Abby</HI> Church in <HI>Westminster,</HI> was the last time built by King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, of excellent workmanship, sup∣ported with sundry rows of Marble Pillars▪ and the roof covered o∣ver with sheets of Lead: a peece of work that cost fifty years la∣bour in building: It was afterwards much enlarged towards the West end, by the succeeding Abbots: and at the East end King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh built for the burial of himself, and his children, a Chappel of admirable, and stately workmanship: called by <HI>Leland,</HI> the <HI>VVonder of the VVorld:</HI> for a man would think that all the curious, and exquisite work that can bee devised, is there compacted together; wherein is to bee seen his own most stately, and magnificent monument all of massy and solid Copper.</P>
<P><HI>VVestminster</HI> Hall was built from the ground by King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and made his own habitation, which continued so till <HI>Henry</HI> the eights time, who removed it to <HI>VVhite-Hall,</HI> which formerly be∣longed to Cardinal <HI>VVoolsey.</HI> The <HI>New Exchange</HI> was built by the Earle of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and so named by King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>But to return a little again to <HI>London</HI>: There are in it many publick and beautiful buildings, as that famous Senate-house called <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> built by Sir <HI>Thomas Knowls,</HI> Lord Mayor: <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> a large, and goodly building, erected by <HI>Simon Eire,</HI> to bee a common Granarie, wherein to lay up Corn, to bring down the price thereof in time of a dearth: But especially the <HI>Burse,</HI> which Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> with a so∣lemn Ceremony, named the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> erected upon Pillars for the use of Merchants, and ornament of the City: It was set up by Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham,</HI> Citizen, and Knight: A most magnificent work it is, whether you respect the model of the building, the resort of Merchants from all Nations thither, or the store of wares there∣in.</P>

<P>This <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> was erected in the year, 1566. in this order: The ground whereon it stands, and the houses, were purchased by the Citizens of <HI>London</HI>: It cost them above three thousand five hundred thirty and two pounds: the houses they sold for four hundred seventy and eight pounds, to such persons as should pull them down, and car∣ry them away: Then was the ground levelled at the charges of the City, and possession thereof was by some Aldermen, given to Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham,</HI> Knight, and Agent for Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> thereupon to build a <HI>Burse</HI> at his own proper charges, and hee on the seventh of <HI>June,</HI> laid the first foundation Brick, being accompanied with some Aldermen, every one laying a peece of gold upon his Brick, which the workmen took for themselves, and forthwith followed their work with such diligence, that in <HI>September, Anno Christi,</HI> 1567. the same was finished, and covered with slate.</P>

<P>Besides which, this Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> gave a most spacious house, sometimes his own habitation, one part thereof to bee an Hospital for poor people, and the other to the advancement of learning, now known by the name of <HI>Gresham Colledge</HI>; standing between <HI>Bishops∣gate-street,</HI> and <HI>Broad-street,</HI> and instituted professors of Divinity, Law, Physick, Astronomy, Geometry, Musick, and Rhethorick, al∣lowing them fifty pounds <HI>per annum</HI> a peece, besides Chambers, and other accommodations.</P>

<P>Wee may in the next place take notice how commodiously <HI>Lon∣don</HI> is supplied with water, conveyed by pipes under ground from excellent springs, some of them at a remote distance: besides the <HI>New-River</HI> water brought twenty miles from <HI>Chadwel,</HI> and <HI>Amwel,</HI> in <HI>Hartford-shire,</HI> to the North side of the City near <HI>Islington,</HI> where a large Cistern is made to receive it.

The houses are built very fair, and along the chief streets are galleries, or walking-places, they call them <HI>Rowes,</HI> having shops on both sides, in which a man may walk dry from one end to the other.

Of these <HI>Tercera</HI> is the greatest, and fruitfullest: It abounds with Oil, Wine, Corn, Oade, Fruits, &amp;c. Her best Town is <HI>Angra,</HI> her best Fort <HI>Bra∣zeil,</HI> her Haven bad to Anchor in.</P>
<P><HI>Pico</HI> is the highest, being (as some say) above fifteen miles to the top, which is many times seen cleerly: but about the middle of it hang the clouds. Its about ten miles in circuit: Its for the most part composed of Brimstone, so that many times from the top issue forth flames of fire, as out of <HI>Aetna</HI>: Below are umbragious shades, and cold Rivolets, into which when the vomited fire is forced, those op∣posite Elements eccho forth their discontents in an hideous noise.</P>

It was in the reign of the aforesaid <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> that the <HI>Indies</HI> and many other Islands were found out, the riches whereof hath much augmented the potency of <HI>Spain,</HI> and made her to aspire to the Monarchy of the world.</P>
<P>The chief Rivers in <HI>Spain</HI> are 1. <HI>Tagus,</HI> formerly famous for his golden sands: It riseth in the mountain of <HI>Seira Molina,</HI> running by the City of <HI>Toledo,</HI> and then smoothly gliding by the walls of <HI>Lis∣bon</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> it pays his tribute to the Western Ocean. 2. <HI>Ana</HI> (now <HI>Guadiana</HI>) which rising about the same place, afterwards runs under¦ground for the space of fifteen miles, as our <HI>Mole</HI> in <HI>Surrey</HI> doth. 3. <HI>Baetis</HI> (now <HI>Guadalquiver</HI>) 4. <HI>Duerus,</HI> that runneth from its head in the hills of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscay,</HI> Westward: 5. <HI>Iberus,</HI> which having his head in the same Mountains, runs Eastward almost four hundred miles, of which two hundred is navigable.</P>

The people are me∣lancholy and cholerick: sober, and content with a little, spending more upon the back than upon the belly: They are very ambitious, and good Souldiers, knowing as well how to use a victory, as to gain it; and are more exactly observant of Discipline than any other Nation in the world.

<P>The Kingdome of <HI>France</HI> is composed of four and twenty Pro∣vinces, wherein are fifteen ArchBishopricks, ninety seven Bishopricks, ten Parliaments, fourteen Universities, and four orders of Knight∣hood. The <HI>French</HI> are so naturally inclined to Armes, that the Pro∣verb saith, <HI>They are born souldiers,</HI> nor indeed can they stay long at rest; for if they have no war with their neighbours, they quickly make it amongst themselves: Points of honour make them run into the field, as to a feast, so that many of the Nobility unhappily fall by Duels. They go like Thunderbolts to combats, and conquests, and overcome whatsoever opposes them; but as soon as their heat is cooled, they turn their backs, and suddenly loose what they had gai∣ned with such reputation. <HI>The French are more than men</HI> (saith the Proverb) <HI>at the beginning of a fight, and lesse than women towards the end.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Cavalry is the stoutest and best in the World.

They entertain some for∣reign Prince for their General, whom, when the wars are ended, they presently discard, by which means they avoid factions, and ser∣vitude, which were like to happen if they should imploy any of their own people, who by his vertue, and valour might win the hearts of the souldiers, and so make himself their Prince. 3.

<HEAD>The chief Cities in <HI>Italy</HI> described. A Description of old <HI>Rome,</HI> and the chiefest Rarities thereof.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> when it was first built was but two &amp; twenty miles in compasse: it was situated upon dainty hills, in a most healthfull air: had a brave River running by it, with the more ease to convey the in-land com∣modities for her necessity, and delight; it had the Sea at a conveni∣ent distance, not too neer, whereby shee might be annoyed with For∣reign Navies, nor so remote, but that shee might bee supplyed with outlandish Commodities. The River <HI>Tiber</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> is four hundred foot broad, and so deep that it will carry ships of the greatest burden. Its about sixteen miles distant from the Sea. It was almost round in compasse. The Suburbs in processe of time grew so great, that <HI>Aure∣lian</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="67"/>
the Emperor built new walls, which were almost fifty miles in compasse, the walls were adorned with seven hundred and forty Turrets: And yet again, the Suburds in a little time grew so great, that one of them was fifteen miles long, and reacht even to the Sea, and in <HI>Augustus</HI> his time, there was numbred in <HI>Rome</HI> above three hundred, and twen∣ty thousand poor people that received relief from the publick: Be∣sides the number of Bondmen was very great: few rich men, but they had an hundred and some four hundred a peece: <HI>Seneca</HI> saith in his time that the Inhabitants were so many, that the spatious and innume∣rable houses were scarce able to contain them: that a great part of them were Forreigners that came from all parts of the world to live there: So that the number of Inhabitants was reckoned to bee at least four millions. These people were sustained with provisions brought out of all Nations: so that <HI>Rome</HI> seemed to bee the common Mart of the whole World.</P>
<P><HI>Heliogabalus</HI> to shew the greatnesse of the City; caused all the Spi∣ders to be gathered and put together, which being weighed, amoun∣ted to ten thousand pound weight, and a great plague breaking out at <HI>Rome,</HI> for many dayes together, there dyed ten thousand per∣sons.</P>
<P>The houses were generally built very high, that so they might bee the more capacious, insomuch as <HI>Augustus</HI> was fain to make a Decree, that their buildings should not exceed seventy foot in height, conceiv∣ing that they marred the delicacy of the air, by their over-much sha∣dow: but this extended only to private mens houses, for the great men were not limited.</P>
<P>But besides the great height of the houses, they were beautified by the matter whereof they were built, by the Architecture, and by the Symmetry of them, wherein Art and Elegancy strove for priority. And for that end, what exquisite workmen soever <HI>Greece,</HI> or <HI>Asia</HI> brought forth, they were either sent for, or came of their own accord to beautify this Imperiall City, especially in <HI>Augustus's</HI> time, who made his boasts, <HI>Marmoream se relinquere, quam lateritiam accepisset</HI>: that hee should leave <HI>Rome</HI> built of Marble, which hee found built of Bricks.</P>
<P><HI>Nero</HI> also when hee had burned a great part of it, at his own charges built it up again, beautifying it with excellently composed streets large wayes, and curious porches to all the houses, which three things were a great Ornament to the City: whereupon <HI>Cassiodorus</HI> saith, <HI>Our fore-Fa∣thers tell us of the seven wonders of the world: The Temple of</HI> Diana <HI>at</HI> Ephesus: <HI>The costly Tomb of King</HI> Mausolus: <HI>The brazen Statue of the Sun in the Isle of</HI> Rhodes, <HI>called the</HI> Colossus: <HI>The Image of</HI> Jupiter Olympicus <HI>made by</HI> Phidias: <HI>The house of</HI> Cyrus <HI>King of the</HI> Medes <HI>and</HI> Persians, <HI>built by</HI> Memnon: <HI>The walls of</HI> Babylon <HI>built by</HI> Semiramis: <HI>And the</HI> Pyramides <HI>of</HI> Egypt. <HI>But now</HI> (saith hee) <HI>the City of</HI> Rome <HI>is the greatest miracle of them all.</HI> There were in it four hundred twenty four Temples erected to their Idol-gods.</P>
<P>There were two Capitols in <HI>Rome</HI>; The old built by <HI>Numa,</HI> the
<PB N="127" REF="67"/>
new begun by <HI>Tarquinius Priscus,</HI> and <HI>Superbus,</HI> finished by <HI>Horatius Pulvillus</HI> Consul, upon the <HI>Saturnin,</HI> or <HI>Tarpeian,</HI> or <HI>Capitoline</HI> hill. It was eight acres, or eight hundred feet in compasse, almost four square. It was ascended unto by one hundred steps on the South part, which looked towards the market place, and Palace, it would hold eight thousand men. It was covered with Brasse-tiles all guilt with Gold; There were three Chappels in it, to one of which <HI>(viz. Jupiters) Augustus</HI> gave sixteen thousand pound weight of gold, and jewels worth almost as much more, twelve thousand talents were spent in gilding of it. The gates were covered with thick plates of Gold.</P>
<P>The only foundations of this Capitol cost <HI>Tarquinius</HI> forty thousand pound weight of silver, the pillars of it were cut out of a Quarry of Marble, called <HI>Pentick-marble,</HI> and they were as thick as long. <HI>Plut.</HI></P>
<P>Next after the Capitol, the <HI>Pantheon</HI> is worthily noted. It was built by <HI>Agrippa,</HI> son in Law to <HI>Augustus</HI> in the year of the City seven hundred twenty and nine. The Architecture of it was admirable, the beauty, and proportion of all the parts most exquisite: the breadth of it was one hundred forty and four feet, and the height as much: It was wholly covered over with very great tiles of Brass richly guilt. In the reign of <HI>Trajan</HI> it was burnt by lightning, and re-built by <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣drian.</HI></P>
<P>The Temple of <HI>Peace</HI> was built by <HI>Vespasian,</HI> three hundred foot long, and two hundred broad: It was the most beautifull of all the Temples in the City, and enriched with gifts of inestimable value: It was adorned with Statues, and pictures of most exquisite workman∣ship: yea and all the rarities were collected into this Temple, for the sight whereof men formerly used to travell through the whole world. And here also hee placed those vessels which formerly belonged to the Temple of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and were brought from thence by <HI>Titus</HI> at the sacking of it. It was burnt down in the time of <HI>Commodus,</HI> either with fire from heaven, or arising out of the earth after a little Earth∣quake.</P>
<P>There were an infinite number of Baths both publike, and private in <HI>Rome.</HI> Some of which baths, were all paved with plates of silver and set with rows of Pillars for ornament. <HI>Antoninus's</HI> bath had sixteen hundred seats of polished Marble in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Appian</HI> Causey was built by <HI>Appius Claudius</HI> Censor▪ It reached from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Capua,</HI> the bounds of the Empire that way, at that time; which was afterwards lengthened to <HI>Brundusium</HI> by <HI>Julius,</HI> and <HI>Au∣gustus Caesar,</HI> in all three hundred and fifty miles long, and so broad, that two coaches might easily pass by one another, being about twenty and five foot broad. It was made of hard flinty stones, hewen and laid so close together (yet without any morter or claspes of Iron) that it seem∣ed all of onestone; the stones were three, four, and five feet square: nine hundred years after it was made, the stones were not one whit dis-joyn∣ted or broken, ever and anon on the sides were stones whereon persons might sit, or lay their burdens, or get on horseback, and at every
<PB N="128" REF="68"/>
miles end, high stones (or pillars) were raised, whereon were engra∣ven the number of the miles. Likewise there were many Monu∣ments on both sides with witty inscriptions, or pretty inventions on them, yeelding both matter of mirth, and seriousness to the travel∣lers.</P>
<P>There were fourteen (saith <HI>Pliny</HI>) twenty (saith <HI>P. Victor) Aquae∣ducts</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI>; the chiefest of which was the <HI>Claudian,</HI> began by <HI>Ca∣ligula,</HI> and finished by <HI>Claudius</HI>; so big as a man might ride on horse∣back in it; brought forty miles to the City in a level, through the Mountains, and over the Vallies; as high as the highest hill in the City: seven millions and a half were spent in making it. There were besides in the City one thousand three hundred fifty two Lakes, or great receptacles of water for common use.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cloacae,</HI> or common sewers, were made by <HI>Tarquinius Priscus</HI>; they were so wide, that a Cart loaden with Hay might passe along them, <HI>viz.</HI> sixteen foot wide, and as many high. There were seven chief armes from the seven hills (besides several smaller from other parts) which ran into the main Channel. Notwithstanding all the weight of building upon them, and several earthquakes, they remained firm almost eight hundred years. And at one time when they were out of repair, there were a thousand talents spent in repairing of them.</P>
<P>There was an infinite number of Statues, or Images in every part of the City, costly for their matter, and curious for their work∣manship: some Authors say, that there were near as many of them, as there were living people in the City; some of them were of polished Marble; infinite of brass, some of Ivory, some of Silver, and some of Gold.</P>
<P><HI>Domitian</HI> the Emperour commanded that no statues should bee made for him in the <HI>Capitol,</HI> but such as were all of silver, or all gold, solid, and not hollow, each of them weighing at least an hundred pound weight: <HI>Commodus</HI> the Emperor had a statue made for him of gold that weighed a thousand pound weight: Together with a Bull and a Cow of the same mettal, as if hee had been the founder of the City. Hee had also in the Market-place a Pillar erected, and his Statue made upon it, of a thousand five hundred pounds weight of silver. Their statues of brass were most of them guilt, and so were many of their statues of silver. Some of them were of a <HI>Colossaean</HI> bigness, others mounted on horse-back, and in several postures, and habits: For the preserving of all which from hurt, there was one who was called <HI>Comes,</HI> or an Earl, whose office it was, continually to walk up and down in the night, attended with many souldiers, that none might wrong them, and besides it was death for any man to do it. <HI>Lipsius de Mag. Rom. Imperii.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> was for her beauty and bravery called <HI>Aurea,</HI> and <HI>Aeterna,</HI> and the <HI>Romanes</HI> thought that the Monarchy of the World was tyed to them with chains of Adamant. But God hath confuted their golden dreams by breaking their Empire, and given up their City

<HEAD>The manner of the Romane Triumphs: and particularly that of <HI>Palus Aemylius</HI> after the conquest of <HI>Perseus</HI> King of Macedon.</HEAD>
<P>First, the people having set up sundry scaffolds as well in the lists, and field called <HI>Circos,</HI> where the games, and races of horses, and Char∣rets used to bee, as also about the Market-place, and in all the streets through which the Triumph should pass, they all presented themselves in their best gowns, to see the magnificence, and state thereof. All the Temples of the Gods were set wide open, hanged full of Garlands of flowers, and all perfumed within. Through all the quarters of the City were set many Sergeants, and other officers, with tipstaves to order the stragling people, and to keep them from pestring the streets, or hindring the triumph which lasted three dayes.</P>
<P>The first day was scant sufficient to see the passing by of the Ima∣ges, Tables, Pictures, and Statues of a wonderful bignesse, all wonne, and gotten of their enemies, and now drawn upon two hundred and fifty Charrets.</P>
<P>The second day there were carried upon a great number of Carts all the fairest, and richest Armor of the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> as well of Cop∣per, as of Iron, and Steele, all glistering bright, being newly fur∣bished, and artificially laid in order: Fair Burganets upon Targets, Habergions, and Corslets upon greaves: Round Targets of the <HI>Cre∣tans,</HI> and Javelins of the <HI>Thracians,</HI> and arrows amongst the armed pikes: All bound so trimly one to another, that one hitting against another as they were drawn, made such a sound, and noise as was fearful to hear. After these Carts there followed three thousand men, which carried the ready mony in seven hundred and fifty Ves∣sels which weighed about three Talents a peece, each of them car∣ried by four men. Others carried great bowles, cups and goblets of silver, and other pots to drink in, beautiful to behold, as well for their bignesse, as for the great, and singular embossed work about them.</P>
<P>The third day early in the morning the Trumpets sounded the brave alarum they give at an assault, after whom followed one hun∣dred and twenty goodly fat Oxen, with their horns guilt, and gar∣lands of flowers, and nosegaies about their heads, and by them went many young men with aprons of needle-work about their middles, who led them to the Sacrifice, and with them young boyes that car∣ried
<PB N="130" REF="69"/>
goodly Basons of gold and silver to receive, and sprinkle the blood of the Sacrifices about. After these followed all those that carryed all coins of gold, and Basons, and Vessels, each of them weigh∣ing three Talents. Then was carryed the great holy cup which <HI>Aemy∣lius</HI> had caused to bee made of massy gold, set full of precious stones, weighing ten Talents for an offering to the gods. Next to them went they which carryed Plate, made, and wrought after Antick fa∣shions, and the admirable cups of the ancient Kings of <HI>Macedon</HI>: as the cup called <HI>Antigonus,</HI> and another <HI>Seleucus</HI>: and to bee brief, all the whole cup-broad of plate of gold, and silver of King <HI>Perseus:</HI> and next them came the Kings Charriot with his Armour, and his royal Crown upon the same. A little after followed the Kings Children, whom they led prisoners with the train of their School Masters, and other Officers, and their servants weeping, and lamenting, who held up their hands to the people that looked upon them, thereby teach∣ing the young Children to do the like, and to ask mercy, and grace at the peoples hands. There were three pretty little Children, two sons, and a Daughter amongst them, who by reason of their tender years lacked understanding, which made them (poor souls) insensible of their present misery, and that moved the people so much the more to pitty them, seeing the poor little infants that knew not the change of their hard hap: so that through compassion to them, they had almost let the Father pass without looking upon him: yea many of the peoples hearts did so melt for pitty, that the tears ran down their cheeks till they were past, and gone a good way out of sight.</P>
<P>King <HI>Perseus</HI> the Father followed after his Children, and their train: Hee was cloathed in a black gown, with a pair of slippers on his feet, after his Country manner: Hee shewed by his countenance, his troubled mind, being opprest with sorrow for his most miserable estate, and condition: Hee was followed with his kinsfolk, his famili∣ar friends, his officers, and houshold servants, their faces being dis∣figured with blubbering, shewing to the world by their lamentable tears, and sorrowful eyes cast upon their unfortunate Master, how much they sorrowed, and bewailed his most hard and woful estate, whilest they made little account of their own misery.</P>
<P>After all these, there followed four hundred Princely Crowns of gold, which the Cities, and Towns of <HI>Greece</HI> had purposely sent by their Ambassadors unto <HI>Aemylius,</HI> to honour his victory: And last of all came <HI>Aemylius</HI> himself in his Triumphant Chariot, which was passing sumptuously set forth, and adorned: This was a gallant sight to behold, and yet the person himself was worth looking on without all that great pomp, and magnificence: for hee was cloathed in a pur∣ple gown, curiously branched with gold, carrying in his right hand a bough of Lawrel, as all his Army did the like, the which being divi∣ded by bands and companies: followed the Triumphant Chariot of their Captain, some of the souldiers singing songs of victory, accor∣ding to the usual manner of the <HI>Romans</HI> in the like cases, mingle∣ing
<PB N="131" REF="69"/>
them with merry, and pleasant toyes, as glorying, and rejoycing in their General: others of them sang songs of Triumph in the honour, and praise of <HI>Aemylius</HI> his noble conquests, and victorys: so that hee was openly praised, blessed and honoured of all, and neither hated, nor envied of any that were good, and honest. <HI>Plut. in vita ejus.</HI></P>

<P>For the statelinesse and magnificence of this Triumph, though <HI>Pompey</HI> had two dayes to shew it in, yet were there many things, which for want of time were not seen; even so many as would have served to have set forth another Triumph.</P>
<P>In the first place there were Tables carryed, whereon were written the names and titles of all the people, and Nations which hee had conquered, and for which hee triumphed; as the Kingdomes of <HI>Pon∣tus, Armenia, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Media, Colchis, Iberia, Alba∣nia, Syria, Cilicia,</HI> and <HI>Mesopotamia</HI>: as also the people that dwell about <HI>Phaenicia, Palaestine, Judaea,</HI> and <HI>Arabia:</HI> and all the Pirates which hee had overcome both by Sea, and Land, in all parts of the world: In all these Countries, hee had taken a thousand Castles, al∣most nine hundred Cities, and walled Towns▪ Of Pirates ships eight hundred: Hee had replenished again with people, nine and thirty de∣solate Towns that were left without Inhabitants: In these Tables was further declared, that before these conquests the revenues of the Common-wealth of <HI>Rome</HI> were but five thousand Myriads <HI>per an∣num,</HI> but now <HI>Pompey</HI> had made them eight thousand and five hundred Myriads <HI>per annum</HI>: and that hee had brought now for the Treasu∣ry in ready gold and silver, Plate and Jewels, the value of twenty thousand Talents, besides that which hee had distributed amongst his souldiers, of which hee that had least for his share, had one thou∣sand five hundred Drachma's: The prisoners that were led in this Triumph, besides the Captains of the Pirates, were, the son of <HI>Ty∣granes,</HI> King of <HI>Armenia,</HI> with his wife and daughter: The wife of King <HI>Tygranes</HI> himself, called <HI>Zosime: Aristobulus,</HI> King of <HI>Judaea: Mithridates</HI> sister, with her five sons, and some Ladies of <HI>Scythia</HI>: The hostages also of the <HI>Iberians,</HI> and <HI>Albanians,</HI> and of the Kings of the <HI>Commagenians</HI>: beside many other things too large to recite: But that which made his honour the greatest, and whereunto never any of the <HI>Roman</HI> Consuls attained, was, that in his three Triumphs, hee triumphed over the three parts of the world: In his first over <HI>A∣frick,</HI> in his second over <HI>Europe,</HI> and now in this third over <HI>Asia,</HI> which was almost all the then known world; and all this before hee was forty years old. <HI>Plut.

<HEAD>A Description of the City of <HI>Venice,</HI> with her Rarities, which was begun to bee built <HI>Anno Christi 421.</HI> upon the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> and upon seventy and two Islands.</HEAD>
<P>This Wonder of Cities, is seated in the bosome, or betwixt the Armes of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea: It is built upon four thousand Islands, and is (as it were) chained together by four thousand Bridges. The occasion which made these watry Isles a mansion for men, was when that Northern Deluge of <HI>Goths, Vandals, Huns,</HI> and <HI>Longobards</HI> did o∣verflow all <HI>Italy,</HI> the people of all sorts fled to these lakes, to avoid the land torrent that was like to swallow them up; and finding the Air to bee gentle, and fit for habitation, and propagation, they pitched their Tents upon these Isles, and associated them by conjoyning Bridges.</P>
<P>There are seventy two Isles that support <HI>Venice:</HI> and the nearest part of the Continent is five miles distant: There are banks, and dit∣ches cast up to preserve her from the impetuousnesse of the waves of the Sea, extending in length above six miles. Shee is above eight miles in circuit. Through the banks in seven places, there are passa∣ges broken for boats, but not for bigger vessels. Besides there be above twenty thousand Gondolaes, or Boats, which ply up and down perpetually, in each of which are two rowers at least, so that upon oc∣casion, shee can suddenly make an Army of above fifty thousand Gon∣doliers. Shee hath for her Motto, <HI>Nec fluctu, nec flatu movetur.</HI> Nor winds, nor waves can stir her.</P>
<P>Her Fabriques, publick and private are extraordinary specious, and sumptuous, and her streets so neat, and evenly paved, that in the depth of winter a man may walk up, and down in a pair of Sattin Pan-tables, and Crimson Silk stockings, and not bee dirtied. There are above two hundred Palaces fit to receive any Prince with his ordinary retinue: Her situation is so rare, every street almost having an arm of the Sea running thorow it; and her structures so magnificent, and neat, that shee ravisheth therewith all strangers that come to visit her.</P>
<P>She hath in her one hundred and fifty Churches, and Monasteries: but especially three things worthy of sight, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Mark's</HI> Church and Steeple, the <HI>Treasury,</HI> and the <HI>Arsenal.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Mark's</HI> Church is built throughout with rare <HI>Mosaique</HI> work, and yet the furniture of the Church surpasseth the Fabrique in richnesse; Her walls are inlaid in many places with precious stones of diverse co∣lours, and in such a manner, that they seem rather to be the work of Na∣ture, than of Art.</P>
<P>It is built in the form of a Crosse, whose corners are highly vaulted, and covered with bright Lead, as all the rest of the Church is. The whole Bulk is supported with most curious Arches joyned together by marvellous Art. The inside from the middle to the highest part there∣of glistereth with gold, and the concavity of the vaults is enriched
<PB N="133" REF="70"/>

On the height of this entrance, are four great brazen horses all gilded over, in a posture as if running, and neighing. All this bears up the highest top of the Church divided into six Steeples, every of which is like a <HI>Pyramid,</HI> and hath on the sharpest point thereof, a white Marble Statue of a naked man standing upright. Divers other representati∣ons delightfull to the eye, and wrought with exceeding skill, do beau∣tify the spaces between the Steeples, and all that which is vaulted underneath is covered with Gold▪ In sum, there is no place in the whole Church, either within, or without, but it's either adorned with Marble, Gold, or precious stones; so that the two Columnes of Alabaster, and the <HI>Chalcedony</HI> stones which are in the middest of the pavement, are accounted the least curiosities.</P>

<P><HI>Florence</HI> is the Capitol City of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> situated at the bottom of very high hills, and environed on all sides with the same, except on the West side, before which lies a plain Country. This City is divided into two by the River <HI>Arno,</HI> over which are built four Bridges of stone; upon one of the two chief is the Goldsmiths street: upon the other, which is a very stately structure, stand the four quarters of the year in Marble: Opposite unto which, stands a vast Co∣lumne with a Statue of Justice in <HI>Porphyrie</HI> at the top: Hard by is the Palace of <HI>Strossie,</HI> admirable for the immensity of its Fabrick; on the left hand whereof is the Merchants Vault supported with many fair Pillars, and before it a brazen Boar jetting forth water: Before that is the great place, in the middest whereof is the great Duke <HI>Cosmus</HI> on horseback in brass, near unto which is a Fountain, the like to which <HI>Italy</HI> affords not. Round about the Laver is the Family of <HI>Neptune</HI> in brasse, with his <HI>Colosse</HI> of Marble in the middest, born up by four horses. In this same <HI>Piazza</HI> is a Porch arched and adorned with some Statues, amongst which that of <HI>Judith</HI> in brass, with the rape of the Sabines, three persons in several postures cut all out of one stone.

Statues. Near to it is the richest of Treasures, the great Dukes Gallery, in the uppermost part whereof are contained as many won∣ders as things: some to bee admired for the preciousness, and Art; others for their rarity, and antiquity: On each side of the Gallery stand above fourescore Statues: One, an Idoll brought from the Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> in <HI>Delphos:</HI> Another of <HI>Scipio Africanus</HI> holding up his gown under his Arm: Then two curious triumphant Pillars: O∣ver the Statues hang rare pictures, the most famous Scholars on the one side, and Souldiers on the other.</P>
<P>At the right hand of this Gallery are several <HI>Stanza's</HI> full of curi∣osities, wherewith the spectators are astonished, both in regard of the richnesse, and rarity thereof.

<P>The Cathedral Church is of a vast bulk, and exquisite workman∣ship, made of Red, White, and black Marble. The <HI>Cupola</HI> is so high, that the brass Globe at the top will hold sixteen persons: No lesse excellent is the Steeple, composed of the same stone and materials with the Church, but with more Art, and Ornaments.</P>
<P>The Chappel of St. <HI>Laurence</HI> seems more than terrestrial: Its wholly overlaid with fine polished stones, neither is there any colour upon Earth, but it's there in stones naturally. Near to this is a fa∣mous Library, filled with great variety of Manuscripts. In brief, the

<P>The compass of this spacious Country is two thousand and six hun∣dred <HI>English</HI> miles: The Inhabitants are little addicted to <HI>Venus,</HI> but very much to <HI>Bacchus</HI>; they are of strong constitutions, and much inclining to fatnesse. The titles of the Fathers descend to all their Children, every son of a Duke, being a Duke, and every Daughter a Dutchess.

offensive, and defensive league, cantoned themselves under a new Government.</P>
<P>These <HI>Helvetians</HI> are shut up within Mountains, and great Lakes, which make their Country unaccessible. The tyranny of some Go∣vernours, as aforesaid, caused them to shake off the yoak, not only of the house of <HI>Austria,</HI> but of their own Nobility also. Their first league was begun by three Country Peasants, which in a short time was much augmented, by the aversion of the people from the above∣said Government. <HI>Let no man trust to his own power, and maintain it by rigour, for enemies often come from whence they are least expected.</HI> So soon as this league was made, they seized upon the Castles of their Governours, and drove them out of their Country <HI>Anno Chri∣sti</HI> 1307. But Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> being puffed up by some con∣quests hee had made, and being provoked by the solicitations of the expulsed Nobility, led his forces against the Villages, but was de∣feated in the Mountains, near <HI>Morgarten.</HI> This victory of the <HI>Swit∣zers</HI> produced the perpetual alliance of the three Villages, to which the rest shortly after adjoyned themselves; yea, and many imperial Towns near them have so leagued themselves with them, that now they have no enemie that they need fear, except from among themselves: Since which time their alliance hath been sought by Popes, Kings, and Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> and especially by <HI>France,</HI> which by keeping in with them, through a yearly pension, hath drawn no small ad∣vantages from them.</P>
<P>Their Republick is composed of three orders: The Villages to the number of thirteen. The Associates, or Confederates: And the Towns which depend upon their direction. They have also di∣vers forms of Government: for that of the Villages is <HI>Democratical</HI>; and that of the Towns, <HI>Aristocratical</HI>: which mixt Common-wealth is only kept in unity by the care which shee hath of her own preser∣vation. Their Assemblies are made by a general Convocation to treat of war, peace, &amp;c. at which the Ambassadors from every Town are to meet. Their Religion in some of the Cantons is only <HI>Ro∣mane,</HI> in others reformed, and in some mixed.

<HEAD>The City of <HI>Constantinople</HI> described.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Constantinople,</HI> was built by <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great; It stands on a cape of land, near the entrance of the <HI>Bosphorus:</HI> Its in form triangular: On the East side washed with the Sea; on the North with the Ha∣ven: and the West side joynes to the Continent. Its walled with brick, and stone intermixed orderly, having twenty four Gates, and Po∣sterns: Its about thirteen miles in Circumference. The world hard∣ly affords a more delicate object, if beheld from the Sea, or adjoy∣ning Mountains. The lofty, and beautiful Cypresse-trees are so inter∣mixed with the buildings, that it seems to present a City in a wood to the pleased beholders. Its built on seven hills, whose aspiring heads are crowned with magnificent <HI>Mosques,</HI> or Churches, all of
<PB N="163" REF="85"/>
white Marble, round in form; and coupled above; being finished on the top with guilded spires, that reflect the Sun-beams with a mar∣vellous splendor: some having two; some four, and some six adjoy∣ning Turrets, exceeding high, and slender: Tarrast aloft on the out∣side, like the main top of a ship, in several places equally distant, whence their Priests with elated voices (for they use no bells) call the people together to their Mahometan service.</P>
<P>When <HI>Constantine</HI> first built this City, hee enclosed it with a wall, that for length, fairness, and thickness, was one of the fa∣mousest in the world, every stone being cemented together with brass couplets, that the whole wall seemed to bee but one stone: Hee erected also many high Towers, built many sumptuous Temples, and adorned it with infinit more magnificent buildings, both publick, and private: commanding also by publick Edict all Princes of the Empire, that each of them should build a Palace or some other sumptuous, and splendid Monument there: Hee also brought from <HI>Rome</HI> divers memorable Antiquities, as the <HI>Palladium</HI> of <HI>Troy</HI>: the high Pillar of <HI>Porsido,</HI> which hee caused to bee erected in a fit place, by which hee set <HI>Apollo's</HI> brazen Image of an unmeasurable bigness, having his own name ingraven thereon: Amongst other glorious buildings was the proud Palace of the publick Library, wherein were one hundred and twenty thousand choice written Books: in the midst whereof were the guts of a Dragon, above one hundred and twenty foot long, on which <HI>Homers Iliads</HI> were written in letters of gold: In diverse other parts of the City were very rare things, as the Nymphs Grove: the Market-place of mettal: the famous I∣mages of <HI>Juno, Minerva, Venus, &amp;c.</HI> with infinite other varieties: so that strangers which saw it, being full of admiration were astonished at the beauty of it, judging it a dwelling meet for the Gods, rather than an habitation for earthly Emperours.</P>
<P>But now Time, with her Iron teeth, and the many changes which have happened, have quite altered the face of <HI>Constantinople</HI>: So that now upon the Hill, whereon the Imperial Palace once stood, there are kept Elephants, Panthers, and other wild Beasts in the ru∣ines of it. On the second Hill whereon stood the Palace of the Pa∣triarches, in which were buried in chests of fine Marble, most of the Christian Emperors, a Mosque is now erected. Upon the third Hill is the Sepulchre of the Great <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that won the City, of a marvellous greatness, and magnificence, surrounded with one hundred houses covered with Lead, made to receive strangers of any Nation, where themselves, servants, and horses, may remain three dayes on free cost: Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI> leaving two hundred thousand Ducats reve∣nue <HI>per annum,</HI> to maintain the same. The fourth Hill hath on it the Church, and Sepulchre of Sultan <HI>Selim</HI> in the same form, and order as the other. The fifth hath the Church and Sepulchre of <HI>Bajazet,</HI> with a great and spacious <HI>Piazza</HI> about it. The sixth hath the Church and Sepulchre of <HI>Solyman</HI> the <HI>Magnificent,</HI> which in greatness, workman∣ship, Marble Pillars, and riches more than Kingly, passeth all the

<HEAD>The <HI>Turks</HI> Seraglio Described.</HEAD>
<P>In the extreamest North-east angle of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> standeth the great <HI>Turks Seraglio</HI> or Palace, compassed with a lofty wall three miles in compasse, comprehending goodly Groves of Cypresse-trees, in∣termixed with plaines, delicate Gardens, Artificial Fountains, vari∣ety of Fruit-trees, and what not rare? Luxury being the Steward, and the Treasury inexhaustible. The proud Palace of the Tyrant o∣pens to the South, having a lofty Gate-house, engraven with <HI>Ara∣bick</HI> Characters, set forth with Gold, and Azure, all of white Mar∣ble: This gate leadeth into a stately Court three hundred yards long, and about one hundred and fifty wide; at the farther end whereof is another gate hung with shields, and Cymiters; this leads into a second Court full of tall Cypresse-trees, being not much lesse than the for∣mer. It is Cloistered round about, covered with lead, handsome∣ly paved, and supported with Columns of Marble, which have Cha∣piters, and Bases of Copper. On the left hand is the <HI>Divano</HI> kept, where the <HI>Bassa's</HI> of the Court do administer Justice: Beyond this Court on the right hand is a street of Kitchins, and on the left stalles large enough for five hundred horses. Out of the second Court is an
<PB N="165" REF="86"/>
entrance into the third, surrounded with the Royal buildings, large, curious, and costly. Without on the North side stands the <HI>Sultan's</HI> Cabinet, in form of a sumptuous summer-house, where hee of ten o∣laceth himself with variety of Objects, and from whence taking barge hee passeth to the delightfull places of the adjoyning <HI>Asia.</HI> In the <HI>Seraglio</HI> also, are many stately rooms appropriated to the season of the year, which are called <HI>Rooms of fair prospect,</HI> into which the Sultan goeth sometimes alone, but more usually with his Concubines for his recreation. Within a fine little Court adorned with very many delicate Fountains is the Chamber wherein hee gives audience to Ambassadors, &amp;c. one part whereof is spread with very sumptuous Carpets of gold, and Crimson velvet, embroydered with very costly Pearls, upon which the grand Signeur sitteth: the walls of the room are covered with fine white stones, having divers sorts of leaves, and artificial Flowers cu∣riously wrought upon them, which make a glorious shew. A little Room adjoyns to it, the whole inside whereof is covered with silver plate, hatched with gold, the floor being spread with rich <HI>Persian</HI> Car∣pets of silk, and gold.</P>
<P>There are belonging to the <HI>Sultan's</HI> lodgings very fair gardens, of all sorts of flowers, and Fruits, that can bee found in those parts; with many very pleasant walks, enclosed with high Cypresse-trees on both sides, and fountains in such abundance, that almost in every walk there are some of them.</P>
<P>Besides the former rooms (which are very many) for the <HI>Sultan's</HI> own use, there are also the womens lodgings, wherein the Queen, the <HI>Sultanaes,</HI> and all the Kings women do dwell, and they have in them bed-chambers, dining rooms, with-drawing rooms, and all other kinds of rooms necessary for women.</P>
<P>In another place there are divers Rooms, and lodgings for all the principal, and inferiour Officers so well furnished, that nothing is want∣ing that is fit, and necessary. Amongst which are two large buildings, one his Wardrob, the other his Treasury, with very thick walls, Iron windows, and Iron doors.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Seraglio</HI> are Rooms for Prayer, Bagnoes, Schools, Butteries, Kitchins, Stillatories, Swimming places, places to run horses in, wrestling places, butts to shoot at, and all the commodities that may adorn a Prince's Court.</P>
<P>There is also an Hospital for such as fall sick in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> in which there are all things necessary for diseased persons: And another large place wherein is kept Timber, Carts, &amp;c. to have them neer hand for the use, and service of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI></P>
<P>Over the Stables there is a row of rooms, wherein is kept all the furniture for the horses, which is of an extraordinary value; for the Bridles, Petorals, and Cruppers, are set so thick with jewels of divers sorts, that they cause admiration in the beholders, and exceed Ima∣gination. The <HI>Grand Signior's</HI> Bed-chamber hath the walls covered with stones of the finest China mettal, spotted with flowers of divers colours, which make a very dainty shew: The <HI>Antiportaes</HI> were of
<PB N="166" REF="87"/>
cloath of gold of <HI>Bursia,</HI> and their borders of Crimson Velvet, embroi∣dered with gold, and Pearls: The posts of his Bedstead were of sil∣ver, hollow, and instead of knobs on the tops, there were Lyons of Crystall; the Canopy over it was of cloth of gold, and so were the Bolsters, and Matteresses: the floor was covered with very costly <HI>Persian</HI> Carpets of silk, and gold, and the Pallats to sit on, and Cushi∣ons were of very rich cloth of gold.</P>
<P>In the hall adjoyning is a very great Lanthorn round, and the bars of silver, and gilt, set very thick with Rubies, Emeralds, and Turkes∣ses; the panes were of very fine Crystal, which made a very resplen∣dent shew. There was also a Bason, and Ewre, to wash in, of massie gold, set with Rubies, and Turkesses.</P>
<P>In <HI>Constantinople</HI> is a <HI>Piazza,</HI> in which is raised upon four Dice of fine Mettal, a very fair Pyramid of mingled stone all of one peice, fifty Cubits high, carved with <HI>Heroical</HI> letters, resembling the <HI>Agulia</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> in whose top were the enclosed ashes of <HI>Julius Caesar:</HI> In the same <HI>Piazzo</HI> also is a great Pillar of Brasse, made with marvellous Art, in form of three serpents wreathed together with their mouths up∣ward.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Constantinople</HI> eighteen thousand Mosques, great and small: In the chief place of it are two Burses, built four square, high, and round at top, each having four gates opening upon four streets, round about garnished with shops, stuffed with all sorts of rich, and cost∣ly wares of inestimable value, as precious stones, Pearls, Sables, and other rich Furs of all sorts; Silk, and cloath of gold: Bows, Arrows, Bucklers, and Swords: Here also they fell Christian Slaves of all a∣ges, as wee sell horses, the buyers looking them in the eyes, mouth, and all other parts, which is done every forenoon, except Fridayes, which is their Sabbath. The <HI>Bassa's</HI> also in sundry places have built fair houses, encompassed with high walls, which outwardly have no beauty: but inwardly full of all riches▪ and pleasure, the world can afford: For they use to say, that they build not to please passers by, but for their own Commodity.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire Described.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> who hath his seat in the stately, and Imperiall City of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> hath under his command, the chiefest, and most fruitful parts of the three first known parts of the world. In <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> he hath all the sea coasts, from the confines of <HI>Epidaurus</HI> (the utmost bound of his Empire in <HI>Europe</HI> Westward) unto the mouth of the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> now called <HI>Don,</HI> with whatsoever lyes from <HI>Buda</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> to the Imperial City of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> in which space is comprehen∣ded the greater part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> all <HI>Bosna, Servia, Bulgaria,</HI> with a great part of <HI>Dalmatia, Epirus, Macedonia, Grecia, Peloponesus, Thra∣cia,</HI> the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> with the rich Islands contained therein. In <HI>Affrica</HI> he possesseth from the river <HI>Mulvia</HI> (the bounder of the kingdom of <HI>Fesse,</HI> to the <HI>Arabian Gulph,</HI> or <HI>Red-sea</HI> Eastward, except some sea-towns
<PB N="167" REF="87"/>
held by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and from <HI>Alexandria</HI> Northward, unto the City of <HI>Asna</HI> Southward: In which space are contained the fa∣mous Kingdomes of <HI>Tremizen, Algiers, Tunes,</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> with di∣vers other great Cities, and Provinces. In <HI>Asia</HI> all is his from the <HI>Hellespont</HI> Westward, unto the great City of <HI>Tauris</HI> Eastward: and from <HI>Derbent</HI> neer unto the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea Northward, unto <HI>Aden</HI> upon the <HI>Arabian Gulph</HI> Southward.</P>
<P>The greatnesse of his Empire may bee the better conceived by the greatnesse of some of the parts of it: the <HI>Meer of Meotis</HI> (which is all at his command) being in compasse one thousand miles: and the <HI>Eu∣xine,</HI> or <HI>Black-sea,</HI> which is in circuit two thousand seven hundred miles, and the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> coast which is subject to him, contains in compasse about eight thousand miles. The like distance is from <HI>Derbent</HI> to <HI>Aden</HI>: And from <HI>Balsara</HI> upon the <HI>Persian Gulph,</HI> unto <HI>Tremisen</HI> in <HI>Barbary,</HI> are neer four thousand miles. Hee hath also in the <HI>Me∣diterranean</HI> sea, the noble Isles of <HI>Cyprus, Euboea, Rhodes, Samos, Chios, Lesbos,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this so large, and spatious an Empire, are contained many great Countries, sometimes famous Kingdomes, abounding with all sorts of temporal blessings, and natures store; For what Kingdome is more fruitful than <HI>Egypt, Syria,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Asia?</HI> what Countrey more abounding with all good things, than was sometimes <HI>Hungary, Grecia,</HI> and <HI>Thracia?</HI> In these Countries hee hath also many rich and famous Cities, but especially four, which bee of greatest wealth, and trade, <HI>viz. Constantinople, Grand-Caire, Aleppo,</HI> and <HI>Tauris. Con∣stantinople,</HI> for multitude of Inhabitants, exceeds all the Cities in <HI>Europe,</HI> wherein are reckoned to bee above seven hundred thousand men. <HI>Aleppo</HI> is the greatest City of <HI>Syria,</HI> and the Centre whereun∣to all the merchandize of <HI>Asia</HI> is brought. <HI>Tauris,</HI> of late the roy∣al seat of the <HI>Persian</HI> Kings, hath in it above two hundred thousand men. <HI>Grand-Caire</HI> amongst all the Cities in <HI>Africk,</HI> is the chiefest, being the store-house, not only of the riches of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but of much of <HI>Africk</HI> and <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>For his ordinary revenews they are not estimated to exceed eight millions of gold, but his extraordinary escheates are very considera∣ble, as his confiscations, forfeitures, fines, amerciaments, tributes, customes, tenths of all Prizes taken by sea, or Land, &amp;c. which far exceed his standing revenew: His Bassa's, and great officers, sucking out the blood of his poor subjects, and heaping up inestimable trea∣sures, which usually falls to the <HI>Grand Signiors</HI> coffers. His pre∣sents also amount to a great value: for no Ambassadour can come before him without great gifts: none can get Offices, or preferments without money: none may return to him from their Provinces, or expeditions, empty-handed: In brief, its easy for so great a Tyrant to pick a quarrel with any rich man, and so to take away his life, and seize upon his estate be it never so much.</P>
<P>The strength of his Empire consists especially in these four things. In his <HI>Timariots,</HI> which are horsemen, to whom hee hath given lands
<PB N="168" REF="88"/>
for their life, upon condition of serving him upon all occasions with men and horses: by these, as with a bridle, hee keeps all the rest of his Subjects in his vast Empire in awe: for they can no sooner move, but they shall have these <HI>Timariots,</HI> as Falcons in their necks, for to that purpose they are dispersed all over his Dominions: and again, out of them hee is always able to draw into the field one hundred and fifty thousand horse-men well armed, without a farthing charge, to go whither soever hee shall command them. The whole number of them is accounted to bee seven hundred and ninety thousand fighting men: whereof two hundred fifty seven thousand dwell in <HI>Europe,</HI> the other four hundred sixty and two thousand in <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Affrica.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, In his <HI>Spahi, Ulufagi,</HI> and <HI>Carapici</HI> of his Court, which are another sort of horse-men, to whom hee gives pay, being indeed the Seminaries of the great Officers, and Governours of his Empire, for from amongst them, hee chooseth his <HI>Sanzacks,</HI> or Captaines, whom for their good deserts, he raiseth to be <HI>Begs, Begler-begs, Visiers,</HI> and <HI>Bassaes.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Besides these, hee hath other horse-men, called <HI>Acanzii,</HI> which for some priviledges are bound to serve▪ they are of the pea∣sants whom hee much esteems not, only they serve to blunt his ene∣mies swords.</P>
<P>Fourthly, In his footmen, and <HI>Janisaries,</HI> which are born of Chri∣stian parents in <HI>Europe,</HI> and taken from them when they are young, and in whom there appeareth the greatest strength, activity, and courage: They are bred up to hard labour and pains, and after a certain time are taken into the Cloisters of the <HI>Aiamoglans</HI> (for so they are called, till they bee admitted into the number of <HI>Janisaries</HI>) and there delivered to governours, who keep them still exercised to pain∣ful labour, using them hardly in apparrel, diet, and lodging: there they learn to shoot in Bows, and Guns, the use of the Scimiter, and feats of activity, and when they are expert therein, they are admitted into the number of <HI>Janisaries,</HI> or <HI>Spahi.</HI></P>
<P>Now for his strength by sea, hee hath as great means to set forth a Fleet as any Prince whatsoever, the overgrown woods of <HI>Epirus,</HI> and <HI>Cilicia,</HI> with those of <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> and <HI>Trapezund,</HI> yeild him abun∣dance of Timber for ships, and Gallies: neither can he want shipwrights and Carpenters for the framing of them, his large pay drawing many, even from amongst the Christians into his Arsenals at <HI>Constantinople, Synope, Callipolis,</HI> &amp;c. Neither hath hee ever wanted good store of expert Sea-men: for besides those which hee hath in the forenamed places, out of his Gallies, which hee hath at <HI>Lesbos, Chios, Rhodes, Cy∣prus,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and from the Pyrates which frequent his Ha∣vens of <HI>Tunis, Bugia, Tripolis,</HI> and <HI>Algeirs,</HI> hee can as need requires, chuse Captains, Marriners,, and rowers, sufficient for the storing, and managing of his Fleet. Notwithstanding all which, this vast Em∣pire is much declined of late: their late Emperors much degenerating from their warlike Progenitors, their souldiers generally addicting themselves to unwonted pleasures, their ancient discipline of warre be∣ing

<P><HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1486. <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> born at <HI>Ner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i</HI> in the Country of <HI>Genoa,</HI> being a man of projecting wit, excellently skil∣led in Astronomy, and Navigation, strongly conceited that some Lands must needs lye in the portion of the circle▪ which should make up the World into a Globe; considering also the motion of the Sun, hee perswaded himself that there was another world, to which the Sun imparted his light, when hee went out of our Horison. This world hee hoped to discover, and therefore imparted his intent to the <HI>Genowaies,</HI> but was by them rejected. Then sent hee his Bro∣ther <HI>Bartholomew Columbus,</HI> to motion the matter to our King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, but hee, falling into the hand of Pyrates by the way, was long a prisoner before hee was enlarged; but as soon as hee was free, hee came to our <HI>English</HI> Court, and his motion was readily embraced by the King: But God, who had otherwise disposed it, so ordered it, that <HI>Columbus,</HI> not knowing of his Brothers imprison∣ment, because hee heard nothing from him, thought that his suit was rejected, and thereupon addressed himself to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who after many delayes, furnished him with two ships only for disco∣very: with this small assistance hee sailed in the Ocean more than threescore dayes, without discovery of any land, so that his discon∣tented <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to mutiny, absolutely resolving to go no fur∣ther; <HI>Columbus</HI> did all that hee could to pacifie and incourage them, but when nothing would prevail, hee was fain to ingage himself to them, that if land was not discovered within three dayes, hee would steer his course back again: At the end of which time one of the company discryed fire, an evident sign of land, which they took possession of, <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1492. and <HI>Columbus</HI> in honour of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> called it <HI>Hispaniola:</HI> after which hee discovered <HI>Cuba,</HI> and so with much treasure, and greater content hee returned into <HI>Spain</HI>; and after two other voyages hee sickned, and dyed, and was buried at <HI>Sivil.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Columbus</HI> being on a time at supper with some of the great <HI>Spanish Dons</HI> in the Court, they took occasion to speak very sleightly of his <HI>Indian</HI> discoveries, as if it was such a small matter which might have been performed by any man: Hee hearing them, called for an Egge, and when hee had it, desired them to try if any of them could make it stand an end upon their trenchers: they all tryed, and by indeavouring equally to poise it, laboured to make it stand, but could not; then did <HI>Columbus</HI> take it, and knocking it down pretty hard, crackt the end, which caused it to stand up∣right: at this they all laughed, saying, <HI>that every fool could do so:</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="89"/>
Yea (saith hee) and now I have made a discovery of that new world, every one can go thither, &amp;c.</P>
<P>VVhen the <HI>Spaniards</HI> first arrived in those parts, they found the Inhabitants naked, unacquainted with husbandry, making their bread of <HI>Cassavy</HI> roots, worshiping the Devils, whom they called <HI>Zemes,</HI> in remembrance of whom they had certain Images made of Cotton-wool, like to our Childrens babies: To these they did great reverence, as supposing the spirit of their <HI>Zemes</HI> to bee in them: and the Devil to blind them the more, would sometimes make these Puppets move, and make a noise: they stood also in great fear of them, for if they did not fulfil his will, the Devil would ex∣ecute vengeance upon some of the Children of these poor deluded souls. They thought the Christians to bee immortal, wondring at the Masts, Sails, and tacklings of their ships, and to try whether they were immortal or no, having taken some straglers, they held their heads under water till they were strangled, which made them change their opinions. They esteemed gold and silver no more than dross, yet for the colours sake adorned themselves therewith, as they did with shells, feathers, and the like.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> after their coming amongst them behaved themselves very cruelly, killing them like sheep, and forcing them like beasts, to labour in their Mines, to carry their burthens, and to do all manner of drudgery, which caused them so to hate them, that one <HI>Haythney</HI> a noble man amongst them being perswaded to bee baptised, with the promise of Heaven for his reward; asked whither the <HI>Spaniards</HI> went when they dyed? and when answer was made that they went to Heaven, hee renounced his intended Baptisme, protesting <HI>that hee had rather go to Hell, with the unbaptised, than to live in Heaven with so cruel a people.</HI></P>
<P>In some places there was such abundance of gold, that in some Mines they found more gold than earth, which the <HI>Indians</HI> ex∣changed greedily for Hammers; Knives, Axes, Hatchets, and such tools of Iron; for before, they were fain to make their Canows or Boats plain without, of the body of a great tree which they made hollow with the force of fire.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> having thus happily begun this noble enterprize, hee was seconded by <HI>Americus Vesputio,</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> from whom (un∣justly) it was called <HI>America.</HI> To him succeeded <HI>John Cabot,</HI> im∣ployed by our King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh. <HI>Ferdinando Magellane</HI> first found out the South passage, called the streights of <HI>Magellane,</HI> by which hee compassed the world, and was afterwards followed by our <HI>Drake,</HI> and <HI>Candish</HI>; and the Dutch <HI>Nandernoort:</HI> since which time another Dutchman called <HI>Le Maire,</HI> found out a more Southerly passage into the South Sea, called <HI>Le Maires Streights,</HI> by which hee also com∣passed the world.</P>

<P><HI>Mexico,</HI> is now called <HI>New-Spain,</HI> in which is that excellent tree cal∣led <HI>Mete,</HI> which they plant, and dress as wee do our Vines, yeelding so many sorts of commodities: For when they bee tender, they make of them Conserves, Paper, Flax, Mantles, Mats, Shooes, Girdles, and Cordage: On the leaves grow prickles so hard, and sharp, that they use them in stead of sawes. From the root of the tree comes a juice like unto syrup, which if you seeth, it will become Hony, if you purifie it, it will become Sugar: you may also make Wine, and Vineger of it: The rind rosted cureth hurts, and sores, and from the top boughs is such a Gum which is an excellent antidote against poison. It abounds also with many golden sanded Rivers, wherein are Crocodiles which the natives eat: It hath Mines of gold, and a mountain burning like <HI>Aetna.</HI> Its bounded on the East with <HI>Jucutan,</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI>: on the West with <HI>California</HI>: on the South with <HI>Perua∣na</HI>; and the Northern limits are not known.</P>
<P>It was very populous before the arrival of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who in seventeen years slew six millions of them, roasting some, plucking out the eyes, cutting off the arms of others, and casting them alive to bee devoured of dogs, and wild beasts. <HI>Mechuacan,</HI> one of the Pro∣vinces of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> abounds with Mulberry trees, Silk, Hony, Wax, black Amber, and great plenty of Fish: the Inhabitants are tall, strong, active, and speak a copious language.</P>
<P><HI>Mexico,</HI> hath in it a City of the same name, in compass six miles, consisting of six thousand houses of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and sixty thousand of <HI>Indians</HI>: Its situate on Lakes, and Islands like <HI>Venice,</HI> every where interlaced with pleasant currents of fresh, and Sea waters: The plain wherein the Town standeth is seventy leagues in compass, environed with high hills, on the tops of which Snow lyeth continually. The Lake on whose banks the City lyeth is fifty miles in compass, the banks whereof are adorned with pleasant Towns, and houses, and on the Lake are fifty thousand wherreyes plying continually. Nigh to this City is the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> whose current is so swift, and heady, that ships cannot pass directly to, and fro, but are compelled to bear either much North, or much South. Its nine hundred miles in compass, and hath two Ports, one between the farthest part of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> at which the tide entereth with a vio∣lent stream, the other between the said <HI>Cuba,</HI> and the farthest part of <HI>Florida,</HI> at which the tide with the like violence goeth forth: the Sea is very tempestuous, and hath only two safe Havens, <HI>viz.

<P>The Country of <HI>Mexico</HI> is inferior to <HI>Peru,</HI> in the plenty and purity of gold, and silver, but far exceeding it both in the Mechanical, and ingenious arts here professed, and in the abundance of fruits, and cat∣tel, of which last there is such store, that many a private man hath forty thousand Kine, and Oxen to himself; Fish also are very plen∣tiful:

<HEAD>The Fortresse of <HI>Cusco</HI> Described.</HEAD>
<P>One of the <HI>Incas</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> built a fort, that may rather seem the work of Devils than of men, especially considering that these <HI>Indians</HI> had neither Iron, nor steel to work, and cut the stones with, nor Cart, nor Oxen to draw them: yet was this Fort built with stones that seemed Rocks, rather than stones, drawn by strength of men with great Cables, and that through uneven ways, in rough mountains: many of them being brought from places that were ten, twelve, and some fifteen Leagues off: especially that stone which the <HI>Indians</HI> cal∣led <HI>VVearied,</HI> which was brought fifteen Leagues, and over a great river in the way: The most of them came five Leagues off these stones they joined so close together in the building, that the joynts could scarcely bee discerned, which required often lifting up, and setting down, neither could they make Cranes, or any kind of Engines to help them therein, neither had they square, or Rule to direct their work. Instead of mortar they used a kinde of Clay that held fa∣ster.</P>
<P>This Fortresse was built on an hill on the North side of the City of <HI>Cusco,</HI> the hill was so steep on one side, that that way it could not bee assaulted, and therefore one wall served on that side, which was two hundred fathoms long: On the other sides they made three walls, one without another, each being above two hundred fathoms, and were made in the fashion of an half Moon, in which there were stones admirably great: each wall had in the middest one gate, which was covered over with one entire stone: each wall stood thirty foot di∣stant from the other, and at the top of them the battlements were above a yard high: Within those walls there were three strong forts, the middlemost was round, which had in it a Conduit of very good water, brought under ground from far. The walls were all adorned with gold and silver, and had Images of beasts, birds, and Plants enchased therein, which served instead of Tapestry, the other two Forts were square, and they had passages under ground from one to another, artificially made with <HI>Labarinthian</HI> windings, and turnings, in∣extricable but by a thread.</P>
<P>They drew their great stones with great Cables: To draw the stone which they called <HI>Wearied,</HI> they had twenty thousand <HI>Indians,</HI> the one half before, the other behind, and yet in one uneven passage it crushed three or four thousand of them to death.

<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> asked <HI>Atabalipa</HI> what he would give them for his ran∣some? Hee told them that hee would fill that room with Gold, to a mark, that was higher than a tall man could reach by a span, the room being five and twenty foot long, and fifteen foot broad: Then they asked him how much silver hee would give besides: Hee an∣swered, as much as ten thousand <HI>Indians</HI> could carry in ves∣sels of silver of diverse sorts. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> went to <HI>Cusco</HI> to receive part of it, where they found a <HI>Temple of the Sun</HI> covered with plates of gold: as also many pots and vessels of gold, yea there was such store of gold as amazed them, especially one seat which weighed ninteen thousand Pezoes of gold: In another room the pavement, and walls were covered with plates of gold and silver, they found also a great house full of pots, and tubs of silver: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> having worn out their horses shooes in their travel, caused the <HI>Indians</HI> to shooe them with gold.

<P>In <HI>Peru</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> are two admirable High-wayes made by the <HI>Ingas,</HI> or Emperours: The one is by the <HI>Andes,</HI> or Forrests from <HI>Pasto</HI> unto <HI>Chile,</HI> being nine hundred Leagues long, the Caw∣sey five and twenty foot broad; and every four leagues hath a state∣ly house, where was provision of victuals, and apparel, and every half League, men that stood ready to carry messages, and orders from hand to hand. The other way was thorow the Plains along the coast, of twenty five foot broad, and on each side a wall of a mans height from <HI>Piura,</HI> to <HI>Chile,</HI> where both the wayes met. This latter way was between trees that yeelded a very pleasant shadow in those hot Countries, and both of them began at the imperial Ci∣ty of <HI>Cuzco.</HI> P. Pil. v. 3. p. 887, 888.</P>

<P><HI>Cusco,</HI> the Imperial City of the <HI>Incas</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> when the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> first took it, had in it a Temple of the Sun, all the walls where∣of were covered with plates of gold, from the top to the bottom. At the East end was the image of the Sun of one plate of gold, as thick again as the other: the face was round with raies of gold like flames of fire, all of one peece: It was so big, that it filled all from one wall to the other. On both sides were the bodies of their de∣ceased Kings, embalmed, set in seats of gold, placed on planks of

Their <HI>Pacas</HI> are like Pigs, their flesh is pleasant, but they never bring forth above one at a time. There are <HI>Ounces,</HI> some black, some grey, some speck∣led, a cruel, and dangerous beast. The <HI>Curigue</HI> is grey, as big as a Cat, shaped like a Fox, and smells worse; they have a bag from the fore to the hinder feet, wherein they carry their young ones, till they can get their own food: they usually have six or seven young ones.</P>
<P>The <HI>Armadillo</HI> is as big as a Pig, of a whitish colour, having a long snout, and the body armed with things like Plates, so hard, that no arrow can peirce them, except in the flank: with their snouts they dig into the earth with incredible celerity: their flesh tastes pleasant∣ly, and of their skins they make purses.

Another sort there is, big, and long, all green, and beautiful, that live also of Birds, and Eggs. Another sort with a long snout that feeds only upon Frogs, there are rattle-snakes so swift, that they call them the flying-snakes, some of them twelve or thirteen spans long. There are abun∣dance, of other sorts, with Scorpions, and Spiders, and so many Lizards that they cover the walls of their houses.</P>
<P>There are abundance of <HI>Parots</HI> that flye in flocks, and fill whole Islands, they are fair, and of sundry colours, and are good meat.

Wine; fruits, and plants brought from <HI>Spain</HI> prosper well here: here are the <HI>Patagons</HI> some of them are said to bee eleven foot high. Here is a River having in the day time a violent stream, and in the night no water in it, the water proceeding from the melting of the snow upon the Mountains.</P>
<P>The gold in <HI>Chily</HI> is gotten two wayes: One, by washing the earth in great trays of wood; the earth by washing wasteth, and the Gold remaineth in the bottome. The other is by art to draw it out of the Mines: every shower is a shower of gold: for with the violence of the water falling from the Mountains, it brings from them gold along with it. There are also rich Copper Mines, Horses, Goats, and Kine brought thither out of <HI>Spain,</HI> are so encreased, that there are found thousands in heards, wild, and without owners.

<P>Then follow <HI>Orchilia, Oruba,</HI> and some other Islands concerning which we have no more than their names upon record.</P>
<P>That other rank that trends Northward▪ are <HI>Granata, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Dominica,</HI> and North-west, <HI>Desiderara, St. Christophers, Holy-Cross,</HI> &amp;c. all which are called the Islands of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> or Canibals, the Inhabitants whereof eat mans flesh, and passing over in their Canoes, to other Islands, hunt for men as others do for beasts At home they only cover their privities, but in war they use many Ornaments: they are nimble, beardlesse, shoot poisoned arrows, bore holes in their ears, and nostrils, for bravery, which the richer sort deck with gold, the poorer with shels, and make their teeth black, which never ake nor rot: their houses are round, they have hanging beds of Cotton, called <HI>Hammackoe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and they worship only the Sun and Moon.

<P>In <HI>Mona</HI> are wild Boars, and great wild Bulls: in <HI>Moneta</HI> are abun∣dance of Fowl.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antiles</HI> Islands are seven. <HI>St. Vincent, Granado, Lucia, Mata∣lina, Dominica, Guadalupa,</HI> and <HI>Aysey,</HI> where the Natives paint themselves, to keep off the Muskitoes, wear their hair long, cut their skins in diverse works, worship the Devil, and poison their arrows.</P>
<P><HI>Boriquen,</HI> or <HI>St. Johns</HI> Island is three hundred miles long, and seven∣ty broad, traversed with a rough Mountain, out of which flow ma∣ny rivers: Here the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have some Towns: the chiefest is <HI>Por∣to Rico,</HI> taken by the Earl of <HI>Cumberland, Anno Christi</HI> 1597. from whence hee brought about eighty cast peices, and much other wealth.</P>
<P><HI>Mevis</HI> hath in it great store of wood, and in a valley betwixt two hills, there is a bath like unto ours in <HI>England:</HI> There are in it store of Conies, sundry kinds of Fowl, and plenty of Fish; some of our <HI>English</HI> under Captain <HI>Middleton, Anno Christi</HI> 1606, passing through the woods, came to a most pleasant Garden, being one hundred paces square on every side, and had many Cotton trees growing in it, and many <HI>Guiacum</HI> trees; about it were such goodly tall trees growing, as if they had been planted by Art.</P>

<P><HI>Jamica</HI> is very subject to <HI>Hurricanes,</HI> which are such terrible Gusts of wind, that nothing can resist them. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn up Trees, over∣turn houses, transport ships from Sea to Land, and bring with them a most dreadful confusion▪ they are most frequent in <HI>August, Septem∣ber,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> The natives are of quicker wits, than in other Islands.</P>
<P><HI>Cuba</HI> is three hundred miles long▪ some say three hundred leagues, and threescore and ten broad. Its full of Forrests, Rivers, Lakes salt, and fresh, and mountains: Here the people were prohibited the eat∣ing of Serpents, as a dainty, reserved for the higher powers. The air is temperate, the soil is fertil, producing excellent brass, but the gold is drossie: it abounds with Ginger, Mastick, Cassia, Aloes, Cina∣mon, Sugar, Flesh, Fish, and Fowle. The chief Cities being seated on the Northern shoar, are, St. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go,</HI> and <HI>Havana,</HI> a safe rode for ships, where the King of <HI>Spains</HI>▪ Navie rides till they carry home their rich lading.</P>
<P>In this Isle of <HI>Cuba</HI> two things are admirable: one a Valley trend∣ing between two hills for three leagues, which produceth abundance of stones, of a perfect round form like bullets: The other a Foun∣tain, whence <HI>Bitumen,</HI> or a pitchie substance floweth abundantly, and is excellent to pitch ships. In these Islands the Inhabitans have been wasted by the Mines of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and <HI>Cuba</HI> to the number of twelve hundred thousand.</P>
<P><HI>Bermudae</HI> were discovered by Sir <HI>Thomas Summers,</HI> and thence called <HI>Summers Islands:</HI> they are four hundred in number: In the biggest is a Colony of <HI>English,</HI> who found it fruitful, and agreeable to their constitutions.</P>
<P>The commodities in these Islands, are variety of Fish, plenty of Swine, Mulberries, Silk-worms, Palmitos, Cedars, Pearls, and Am∣ber-greese. They have great variety of Fowle, as big as Pidgions, which lay speckled Eggs as big as Hens Eggs on the Sand. Another Fowle there is that lives in holes, like Conie-holes: Tortoises they have, and in the belly of one of them they finde a bushel of Eggs, very sweet: One of them will serve fifty men at a meal: Their win∣ter

<P><HI>Hispaniola</HI> seemeth to enjoy a perpetual spring, the trees always flourishing, and the Medows all the year cloathed in green. Its in a manner equally divided by four great Rivers, descending from high mountains, whereof <HI>Junna</HI> runneth East, <HI>Attibunicus</HI> West, <HI>Na∣biba</HI> South, and <HI>Jache</HI> Northward: Diverse of their Rivers after they have run a course of ninety miles, are swallowed up of the earth. On the top of an high Mountain is a lake three miles in compasse, into which some Rivolets run, without any apparent issue. In one part of this Island is a Lake, whose water is salt, though it receive into it four great fresh rivers, and twenty smaller: It is thought, to have some intercourse with the sea, because some Sharks are found in it: it is sub∣ject to stormes, and tempests. Another Lake there is that is partly salt, partly fresh, being twenty five miles long, and eight broad. These are in a large plain which is one hundred and twenty miles in length, and between twenty five and twenty eight miles in breadth. Another valley there is, that is two hundred miles long, and broader than the former, and another of the same breadth, but one hundred and eighty miles long.</P>
<P>One of the Provinces in <HI>Hispaniola</HI> called <HI>Magua,</HI> is a plain compas∣sed about with hills, wherein are many thousand Rivers and Brooks, whereof twelve are very great: some thousands of them are enriched with gold. Another Province is most barren, and yet most rich, with Mines. From this Island the <HI>Spaniards</HI> used to bring yearly, four or five thousand Duckats of gold.</P>
<P>This Island is much infested with flyes, whose stinging, causeth great swelling; also there is a worm that creepeth into the soles of mens feet, which causeth great swelling, and pain, for which they have no remedy, but to lance the flesh, and so to dig them out.</P>
<P>They have a certain kinde of Beetles, which have four lights that shine much in the dark, two in their eyes, and two under their wings when they flye; they use to bring them into their houses, where they do them double service: First, by killing the Gnats: secondly, by giving them light, which is so great, that they can see to read by it.

Ants were as noisome to them, as Grashoppers in other parts of the world; they spoiled their fruits, and fruit trees; they could keep nothing in their houses, which was fit to bee eaten, from them, and had they continued, they would have unpeopled the Island. There are worms also which do such harm in Timber, that a house will scarce stand here thirty years: when the King in this Countrey died, they buried the best beloved of his Concubines with him, who also had o∣ther women buried for to attend upon them in the other World, toge∣ther with their Jewels and Ornaments: they had also set in their Se∣pulchre a Cup of water, and some of their Cassavi bread. <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 1508, here happened such an Hurricane as threw down most of the houses in <HI>Domingo,</HI> and <HI>Bona ventura,</HI> destroied twenty sail of ships, lifted up many men into the air, who falling down again were miserably bruised.</P>

In their habits, customes, and manners, they resemble the <HI>Indians,</HI> which live upon the continent. They are ingenious, and tractable, and take great pains in helping those Christians which yearly fish upon their coasts, to kill, cut, and boil their Whales, ex∣pecting nothing for their labour, but a little bread, or some other trifles.</P>
<P>All along the coast of this Country, there are many spacious and excellent Bayes, some of them stretching into the land more than twenty leagues. And round about the Coast, and in the Bayes, there are many small Islands, all within a league of the land, which are both fair, and fruitful, neither doth any Country in the world afford greater store of good harbours, nor those more safe, commodious, and free from danger.</P>

Their Win∣ter-houses are built of Whales-bones, covered with earth, and vaulted two yards deep under the earth; within land they have a King that is carried upon mens shoulders: They have Hares as white as Snow, with long fur: Dogs which live on fish, whose pizzels, as also of the Foxes, are bony. Their Summer work is to dry their fish on the Rocks, for their Winter provision: Every one hath a Boat made of Fir-wood, driven thither from other Countries, cove∣red with Seals-skins, about twenty foot long, sowed with sinewes, or guts; so light, that one may carry them, and so swift, that no ship can hold way with them, and yet they use but one Oar which they hold by the middle, in the midst of their Boat, being broad at both ends wherewith they row forward, or backward, at pleasure.</P>

<HEAD>A brief Narrative of some of the barbarous, and inhumane cruel∣ties exercised by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon the <HI>Indians</HI> in this <HI>American</HI> world, collected out of their own Authors.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Bartholomew de las Casas,</HI> a <HI>Dom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nick</HI> Frier, and Bishop in <HI>America,</HI> who wrote in the year 1542. saith thus of them. The <HI>Indians</HI> are a simple, harmless people, loyal to their Lords, and such as gave no occasion of offence to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> till by their extream injuries they provoked them thereto. To these Lambs (saith hee) the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> came as cruel, and hungry Tygers, Bears, and Lions, intending nothing for these forty years but blood, and slaughter to satisfie their avarice and ambition: Insomuch that of three millions of Na∣tives, that they found in <HI>Hispaniola</HI> there remains not one.</P>
<P><HI>Cuba,</HI> and the other Islands indured the like miseries; and in the firm land ten Kingdomes, greater than all <HI>Spain,</HI> were dis-peopled, and left desolate, in which there perished not less than twelve mil∣lions by their tyranny, hee might as truly have said fifty millions.</P>
<P>Their cruelties at their first planting in <HI>Hispaniola</HI> drave the poor <HI>Indians</HI> to their shifts, and to their weak defence, which so enraged these Lions, that they spared neither man, woman, nor child: yea they ripped up the great bellied women▪ and used to lay wagers which of them could with greatest dexterity cut off an <HI>Indians</HI> head, or cut him in sunder in the midst: They would pluck the Infants by the heels from their Mothers breasts, and dash out their brains a∣gainst the stones, or throw them into the River. They set up Gib∣bets, and in honour of Christ, and his Apostles (as they used pro∣phanely
<PB N="187" REF="97"/>
to say) they would both hang, and burn them. Others they took, and cutting their hands almost off, bid them carry letters to their Country-men, who for fear of these Tyrants were fled into the Mountains: The Nobles, and chiefest men they broiled on Gridirons: I once (saith mine Author) saw four or five of them thus roasted, and when they made a lamentable noise, they stopped their mouthes, and so made them indure the torment till they dyed. They kept Dogs to hunt them out of their coverts, which devoured these poor souls: and if at any time an <HI>Indian</HI> thus provoked, killed a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> they made a Law, that one hundred of them should bee slain for him: One of the Kings proffered to till the ground for them for fifty miles space, if they would spare him, and his people from the Mines; but for recompence, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain deflou∣red his wife, and took him prisoner, and sent him into <HI>Spain,</HI> where hee perished by the way.</P>
<P>In another Province of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governour called be∣fore him three hundred <HI>Indian</HI> Lords, some of them hee burned, slew others with the sword, and hanged up the Queen; as they did also in another Province: and for the rest which remained after these Butcheries, they shared them amongst them for slaves. The men they consumed in the Mines, the women by tillage, and by heavy burdens that they made them to carry, and both by famine, scourg∣ing, and other miseries.</P>
<P>And thus they did in all other places whithersoever they came: In the Islands of St. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Jamica</HI> were six hundred thousand Inhabitants, and within few years, there were scarcely two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undred left in either of them: In <HI>Cuba</HI> a Cacique, or Lord, called all his sub∣jects together, and shewed them a box of gold, saying, <HI>This is the Spaniards God,</HI> and made them dance about it, and then hurled it into the River: And afterwards being taken, and condemned to the fire, when hee was bound to the stake, a Frier came and preached to him about Heaven, and Hell: The Cacique asked <HI>if any Spaniards were in Heaven?</HI> yea (said the Frier) such as were good: Then said the Cacique, <HI>I will rather go to Hell, than come where any of that cruel Nation are.</HI></P>
<P>I was once present (saith <HI>Casas</HI>) when the Inhabitants of a Town brought us forth victuals, and met us with great kindness, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> without any cause given, slew three thousand of them, neither sparing age, nor sex. At another time (saith hee) at their request, I sent to other Towns to meet us, promising them good u∣sage, and when two and twenty Caciques met us, our Captain against all Faith, caused them to bee burned; which base usage caused the poor <HI>Indians</HI> to hang themselves: so that a <HI>Spaniard</HI> seeing them take this course, hee made them beleeve that hee would also hang him∣self, to persecute them in the other world, which kept some from this self-execution. Six thousand Children dyed in three, or four months space of Famine, their Parents being sent away to the Mines; the rest they hunted out in the Mountains, and desolate Islands.
<PB N="188" REF="98"/>
In the Land of <HI>Lucaia</HI> they destroyed all, and when they shipped mul∣titudes of them for the Mines in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> for want of food, a third part of them commonly perished by the way, so that an unskilful Pilot might have been directed his way by these floating Carkasses. The like havock they made in the Continent, almost unpeopling all places whe∣ther they came. From <HI>Dariena</HI> to <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> they slew four hundred thousand people with Dogs, sword, fire, and other torments.</P>
<P>They used to send Friers to Preach, that under pain of confiscation, and losse of Lands, Liberty, Life, &amp;c. they should acknowledge God, and the King of <HI>Spain</HI>: yea they would steal to some places, and half a mile off of the citys by night they would make this Proclamation where none heard it, and then in the Night whilst they were asleep, fire their houses, slaying, and taking Captive at their pleasures, and then fall to search for gold. A certain Cacique gave the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gover∣nour the weight of nine thousand Crowns in gold, and hee by way of requital to extort more, bound him to a post, and putting fire to his feet, forced him to send home for three thousand more, and yet not satisfied, hee persisted to torment him, till the marrow came forth of his feet, wherewith hee died; when any of the <HI>Indians</HI> fainted under their grievous burdens, or for want of food, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> least they should loose time in undoing the chain wherein they were tyed, they would cut off his head, and so let the body fall out. At another time they robbed the <HI>Nicaraguans</HI> of their Corn: whereby thirty thousand of them died of famine, and a mother was driven to eat her own child: besides, five hundred thousand were carried away into bondage, and fifty or sixty thousand more were slain in their warres: so that in one of the most populous Regions in the World (saith <HI>Casas</HI>) there remain not above four or five thousand persons. <HI>Cortes</HI> used to have four Kings to wait upon him: hee burned sixty Kings, their children looking on. Another <HI>Spaniard</HI> cast four of their Kings to bee devoured by his dogs.</P>
<P>In <HI>New-Spain</HI> from the year 1518 to 1530. within the compasse of four hundred and eighty miles about <HI>Mexico,</HI> they destroyed above four millions of people by fire, and sword, besides those that dyed by miserable servitude and drudgery. In the Province of <HI>Naco</HI> and <HI>Honduras</HI> in the space of eleven years, two millions of men perished by the same ways. In <HI>Guatimala,</HI> in sixteen years space, were destroi∣ed five millions of souls. <HI>Alvarado,</HI> who was the instrument of this destruction dyed by the fall of his horse, and had his City of <HI>Guati∣mala</HI> destroyed, and overwhelmed by a threefold deluge, of Earth, water, and stones. In his expeditions, he forced the <HI>Indians</HI> by ten, or twenty thousand at a time to go with him, allowing them no o∣ther sustenance, but the flesh of their slain enemys, keeping in his Ar∣my Shambles of mans flesh.</P>
<P>In <HI>Panuco</HI> and <HI>Xalisco,</HI> they exercised the like cruelties: One of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> forced eight thousand of the <HI>Indians</HI> to wall about his Garden, and suffered them all to perish with Famine. In <HI>Machua∣chan</HI> they tortured the King that came forth to meet them, that they
<PB N="189" REF="98"/>
might extort gold from him: they set his feet in the stocks, and put fire thereto, binding his hands to a Post behind him, and then had a boy standing by, that basted his roasted feet with Oil: Another stood with a Cross-bow bent against his breast, and a third stood with Dogs ready to devour him, by these tortures hee dyed. They forced the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> to bring them their gods, hoping they had been of gold, but when their golden hopes failed, they forced them to redeem them again with Gold. Yea where the Fryers had forced the <HI>Indians</HI> to cast a∣way their gods, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> brought more from other places to sell them. In the Province of St. <HI>Martha,</HI> they laid utterly waste and desolate four hundred and fifty miles of land, by destroying the Inhabitants: The like they did in the Kingdome of <HI>Venezula,</HI> where they destroyed four or five millions. Besides, they carried of them Captive out of the Continent into the Islands, a million of Peo∣ple.</P>
<P>They spared no sort of persons; plucked the Children from the breasts to quarter them to their dogs, tortured Kings with new de∣vices borrowed either from the Inquisition, or from hell: they used to cut off the Noses, and hands of men and women that lived peacea∣bly with them: they sold Fathers, Mothers, Children, asunder into diverse places, and to diverse persons never to meet again: they used to ly with the women, that being with child they might yeild them the more mony in their sale. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Priests used to devote them with Curses to the Devil, and taught them vices by their evil practises and examples, insomuch as one said, <HI>Hee would perswade the King of</HI> Spain <HI>to send no more Priests into</HI> America. They teach them Usury, Lying, Swearing, Blasphemy. A Caciques son that was towardly in his youth, and proved after dissolute, being asked the reason of it, said, <HI>since I was a Christian, I have learned to swear several sorts of Oaths, to Dice, to Lye, to swagger, and now I want nothing but a Con∣cubine, to make mee a compleat Christian:</HI> This made them to say, that of all Gods the Christians God was the worst, which had such bad ser∣vants, and to wish for their own gods again, of whom they never re∣ceived so much hurt as from the Christians. <HI>A Christian</HI> (said one of them) <HI>is one that impiously demands Maiz, Honey, Silk, Raiment, an Indian woman to lye with; they call for gold and silver, are idle and will not work, are Gamesters, Dicers, wicked Blasphemers, Backbiters, Quarrellers, &amp;c.</HI> And taking a peece of Gold, hee said, <HI>Loe this is the Christians God: For this they kill us, and one another, for this they play, blaspheme, curse, steal, and do all manner of villanies.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Peru</HI> they had publike places of torture, whereinto they might put a thousand of the miserable Creatures at once, by exquisite tortures to force them to a confession of their hidden treasures: such as escaped these, used to hang themselves in the Mountains, and their wives by them, and their little children at their feet. By Dogs at Land they worried them, and in their Pearl fishings, exposed them to the ravenous Sharks in the seas; by fire, and sword consuming twenty millions of people, since the <HI>Jesuits</HI> went amongst them. These
<PB N="190" REF="99"/>
and infinite more, have been the cruelties which the cruel <HI>Spaniards</HI> have exercised upon the poor, naked, innocent people: Our Author, a Papist, that relates these things, least any should think that hee wrote too much, protests that they were a thousand times worse than hee had set down, the Reading whereof might astonish the sence of the Reader, amaze his Reason, exceed his faith, and fill his heart with horror, and uncouth passions. It is no marvel that God follows such bloody beasts with his vengeance, as lately hee hath done (if the re∣lation be true) which cometh from the mouths of some of themselves, lately taken by some of our Frigots upon the Coast of <HI>Spain,</HI> as they came out of these Countryes, whereof the Narrative follows.</P>
<P>The Marquesse of <HI>Baydex,</HI> now taken by our Fleet neer <HI>Cadiz,</HI> up∣on examination saith, that above five months since there happened in <HI>Lima</HI> a fearfull Earthquake, and a most miraculous rain of fire in <HI>Peru,</HI> insomuch that the whole City of <HI>Lima</HI> is swallowed up, and destroyed, as also the City of <HI>Calao,</HI> in which places there perished above eleven thousand <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and (through the wonderful distinguishing hand of God) not above one hundred <HI>Indians.</HI> In the City of <HI>Lima</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath lost by the Earthquake, one hundred Millions of silver ready wrought up. Also the famous Mines of <HI>Potozi,</HI> where they had their greatest quantities of silver, are destroyed in a wonderfull manner, so that the hill is not to be seen, but all is plain, nor is there any further possibility of having gold, or silver in <HI>Peru:</HI> Some of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves acknowledge, that this judgement is justly befaln them for their cruelty to the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> who crying to God for ven∣geance, have pulled down this visible hand of God upon them.</P>

<P>In <HI>Lima</HI> no houses are covered on the tops, because it never rains, and is a hot Countrey: no City in <HI>India</HI> is richer.</P>
<P>Over the top of the Mountain of <HI>Potosi,</HI> there always hangs a cloud even in the clearest day. The hill riseth in the form of a <HI>Pyramis,</HI> being three Leagues high, environed with cold air: at the foot of it standeth the fair City of <HI>Potosi,</HI> within six leagues about grows no grasse, Corn, nor wood: the entrance, and Mine works are so dangerous, that few that go in return again.

<P><HI>Lima,</HI> is the cheifest City in <HI>Peru,</HI> standing within two Leagues of the South sea, containing about two thousand houses, is very rich, and of more trade than all the Cities of <HI>Peru</HI> besides. It is the seat of the Vice-Roy, the Arch-Bishop, and of the Inquisition.</P>

<P><HI>ANno Christi</HI> 1204. at <HI>Oreford</HI> in <HI>Suffolk</HI> a fish was taken by the <MILESTONE N="1"/> Fishermen at Sea, in shape resembling a wild man, and by them was presented to Sir <HI>Bartholomew de Glanvil,</HI> Keeper of <HI>Oreford</HI> Castle. In all his limbs and members hee resembled a man, had hair in all the usual parts of his body, only his head was bald. The Knight caused meat to bee set before him, which hee greedily devoured, and did eat fish raw, or sod: that which was raw hee pressed with his hand, till hee had squeezed out all the moisture: Hee uttered not any speech, though to try him, they hung him up by the heels, and grievously tormented him. Hee would get him to his Couch at the setting of the Sun, and rise again at the Sun-rising. One day they brought him to the haven, and let him go into the Sea, but to prevent his escape, they set three rows of very strong nets before him, to catch him again at their pleasure: but hee, streightwaies diving to the bottom, crept under all their nets, and shewed himself again to them, and so often diving, hee still came up, and looked upon them that stood on the shoar, as it were mocking of them.

At length after hee had sported himself a great while in the water, and there was no hope of his return, hee came back to them of his own accord, and remained with them two months after.

It was very beautiful, and in those parts well proportioned, having hair hanging down round about the head: He seeing it come within a pikes length of him, stepped back, whereupon it dived under the water, swimming to another place, whereby hee beheld the shoulders, and back down to the middle, which was as square, white, and smooth as the back of a man; from the middle to the hinder part it pointed in proportion like a broad hooked Arrow: Afterwards it came to a Boat wherein some of his men were, attempting to come in to them, till one of them struck it a full blow upon the head: Others of them saw it afterwards also.</P>

<P>There are also <HI>Toad-Fishes</HI> of about a span long, painted, having <MILESTONE N="11"/> fair eyes: when they are taken out of the water, they snort, and swell much: their poison lies only in the skin, and that being flaid off, the <HI>Indians</HI> eat them. <HI>Idem.</HI> p. 1314.</P>

<P><PB N="211" REF="109"/>The <HI>Mannaty</HI> is a strange fish resembling a <HI>Cow:</HI> Her face is like a <MILESTONE N="19"/> <HI>Buffalo's,</HI> her eyes small and round, having hard gums instead of teeth: they feed much on the shore, which makes them taste like flesh of veal: their intrails differ little from a <HI>Cows</HI>: their bodies are com∣monly three yards long, and one broad, they swim slowly wanting fins, in the place wherof they have two things like paps, which are their stilts when they creep on shore to graze, where they sleep long, suck∣ing in the cool air: they cannot keep under water above half an hour. The stone generated in their head is most esteemed, being soveraign against choller adust, the stone collick; and dissenteryes, if beaten small infused in wine, and drunk fasting. <HI>Herb.

<P>The <HI>Carvel</HI> comes of the foam of the sea, every where floating up∣on <MILESTONE N="20"/> the surface of the Ocean, of a round form, throwing abroad her strings like so many lines, which shee can spread at pleasure, therewith angling for small fishes, which shee catches at leisure: you may call her a sea Spider: for when shee sees her webb too weak, she can blow an infectious breath foming death, or such a sting as if she had borrow∣ed it from a Scorpion. <HI>Idem.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>East-Indies</HI> is a trade wind, which they call a Briese, or Mon∣son, which blows West all <HI>April, May, June, July, August,</HI> and part <MILESTONE N="21"/> of <HI>September,</HI> and East the rest of the year: Only on the East of <HI>Su∣matra,</HI> it blows five months East, and five months West, and the o∣ther two variable.

<P>The <HI>Torpedo</HI> is a Fish like a Bream, but somewhat thicker: some <MILESTONE N="22"/> Marriners having one of them in a net, went to take it forth, but one of them presently cryed out that hee had lost the use of his hands, and armes: another that was bare legged putting his foot to it, lost the sence of his leg: but after a while their feeling returned again: whereupon calling their Cook, they bade him to take and dresse it, who laying both his hands thereon, made grievous moan that hee felt not his hands: but when its dead it produceth no such effect, but is good meat. <HI>Pur.

<P>About <HI>Jamica</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> is a Fish called a <HI>Manati,</HI> which is <MILESTONE N="23"/> of a strange shape, and nature: It brings forth her young ones alive, and nourisheth them with Milk from her teates, feeding upon grass in the fields, but lives for the most part in the water: the hinder parts of it are like unto a Cow, and it eats like veal. <HI>Idem</HI> v. 3. p. 930.</P>
<P>In <HI>Brasile</HI> are <HI>Oxe-fishes,</HI> which are very good meat: For head,<MILESTONE N="24"/> hair, skin, cheeks, and tongue, they are like Oxen: their eyes small with lids to open and shut, which no other fish hath: It breatheth, and therefore cannot bee long under water: Instead of fore-feet, it hath two arms of a cubit long, with two round hands, and on them five fin∣gers close together with nails like a mans; Under these arms the female hath paps wherewith she nourisheth her young, she brings forth but one at once. It hath no fins but the tail, which is also round and close: their bones are all massie, and white like Ivory: of this Fish they make great store of sweet Oil: they feed most upon the land. <HI>Idem.</HI> v. 4. p. 1313.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The wonderful works of God in the Creatures. Of strange Fowls, and Birds.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of the <HI>Scottish</HI> Islands there is a rare kinde of Fowl unknown <MILESTONE N="1"/> to other Countrys, called <HI>Colca,</HI> little lesse than a <HI>Goose</HI>: They come thither every year in the spring, hatch, and nourish their young ones: About which time they cast all their feathers, and become stark naked all their bodies over, and then they get themselves to the Sea, and are no more seen till the next spring: Their feathers have no quill, as other feathers have, but are all like unto Down, wherein is no hardness. <HI>Descr. of Scot.</HI></P>
<P>In the North Seas of <HI>Scotland</HI> are great loggs of Timber found, in <MILESTONE N="2"/> which are ingendred after a marvellous manner, a sort of Geese, cal∣led <HI>Claik-geese:</HI> and they do hang by the beak till they are grown to perfection, and then they receive life and fall off: they are many times found, and kept in admiration for their rare manner of Generation: They are very fat, and delicious to bee eaten. <HI>Idem.</HI> Some question the truth hereof.</P>
<P><HI>Storks</HI> are so careful of their parents; that when they grow old, <MILESTONE N="3"/> and so are unable to help themselves, the young ones feed them: and when in passing the Sea their wings fail them, the young ones will take them on their backs, and carry them over. And this is remarka∣ble about them.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Delph</HI> in the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> is so seated for the breed∣ing, <MILESTONE N="4"/> and feeding of these Birds, that it is hard to see an house wherein they do not build. In this Town upon the third of <HI>May; Anno Christi</HI> 1536. a great fire happened when the young <HI>Storks</HI> were grown pret∣ty big: The old ones perceiving the fire to approach to their Nests,
<PB N="213" REF="110"/>
attempted to carry away their young ones, but could not, they were so weighty, which they perceiving, never ceased with their spread wings to cover them, till they all perished in the flames together. <HI>Belg. Common Wealth.</HI> p. 63.</P>
<P>In <HI>America</HI> there are certain small Birds called <HI>Viemalim,</HI> with small <MILESTONE N="5"/> and long bills, that live upon the dew, and of the juice of Flowers, and roses, like Bees: their feathers are of very curious colours▪ they dye, or sleep every year in <HI>October,</HI> sitting upon the bough of a Tree in a warm place, and in <HI>Aprill</HI> following, when the Flowers are sprung, they awake again. <HI>I have one of them.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Arabian</HI> Deserts there are great store of <HI>Ostriches,</HI> that go in flocks, and often affright passengers that are strangers, with their fear∣ful <MILESTONE N="6"/> schreeches, appearing a farre off like a Troop of horsemen. Their bodies are too heavy to bee born up by their wings, which, though uselesse for flight, yet serve them to run with greater speed, so that a swift horse can scarce overtake them: whatsoever they find<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, bee it stones or iron, they greedily swallow it down, and concoct it: when they have laid their eggs, (which are as big as a Culverin Bullet) they forget where they left them, and so return no more to them: but they are hatched by the heat of the Sun in the warm sands: hence. those expressions, Lam. 4.3. <HI>The Daughter of my people is become cruell, like the Ostriches in the wildernesse</HI>: whereupon shee is made the <HI>Em∣bleam of folly,</HI> Job 39.14. &amp;c: <HI>She leaveth her eggs in the earth, and war∣meth them in the dust, and forgets that the foot may crush them,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In <HI>Brasile</HI> there is a little bird, which they call <HI>The risen,</HI> or <HI>Awa∣ken <MILESTONE N="7"/> Bird,</HI> because it sleeps six months, and awakes the other six. It hath a Cap on its head of no one colour, but on what side soever you look, it sheweth red, green, black, and other colours, all very fine. and shining: the breast also shews great variety of colours, especially yellow, more fine than gold; the body is grey, and it hath a very long small bill, and yet the tongue is twice as long as the bill: it flyes very swiftly, and makes a humming like a <HI>Bee.</HI> It always feeds flying. <HI>Pur. Pil.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Socotera</HI> there are <HI>Bats,</HI> whose bodies are almost as big as a Co∣nies, their heads are like Foxes with an hairy Furr upon them: In o∣ther <MILESTONE N="8"/> things they are like our <HI>Bats.</HI> One of them being killed by some <HI>English,</HI> his wings when they were extended, were an ell in length: their cry is shril and loud. <HI>Idem.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Italy</HI> are the Flies <HI>Cantharides,</HI> which by day are of a green shin∣ing <MILESTONE N="9"/> colour, but in the night they shine in the air, like flying Glow-worms, with fire in their tailes. <HI>Raimunds Mercu. Ital.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> there is a Fowl of a prodigious shape, and bignesse: It is three foot high: the body being exceeding great, more than a man <MILESTONE N="1"/> can fathom: their feathers are all white like a Swans, their feet broad like Fowls that swim: their neck half a fathom long, and their beak half an ell, the upper part of it being crooked. From the nether par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the beak there hangs a very great and capable bag of a yellow gol∣den colour, resembling Parchment. With these Fowls the Natives
<PB N="214" REF="111"/>
use to fish, as wee do in <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Cormorants.</HI> They will catch fish with great dexterity, and when they have filled their great bag, which will hold divers fishes of two foot long a peece, they will bring them to their Masters. <HI>Pur. Pil.</HI> v. 2. p. 1643.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11"/> In the <HI>African</HI> Desarts is a certain Fowle called a <HI>Nesir,</HI> some call it a <HI>Vultur.</HI> Its bigger than a Crain. In flying it mounts very high, yet at the sight of a dead carkass, it descends immediatly. Shee lives long, and in extream old age looseth her feathers, and then re∣turning to her nest, is there fed by the young ones of the same kinde. <HI>Idem.</HI></P>
<P>Near unto the <HI>Streights of Magellane,</HI> there is an Island called <HI>Pen∣guin</HI> <MILESTONE N="12"/> Island, wherein are abundance of Fowls called <HI>Penguins,</HI> that go upright; their wings, in stead of feathers, are only covered with down, which hang down like sleeves faced with white. They flye not, but walk in paths of their own making, and keep their divi∣sions, and quarters orderly. They are a strange Fowle, or rather, a miscellaneous creature, of beast, Bird, and Fish: but most of Bird. <HI>Pur. Pil.</HI> v. 1. p. 536.</P>
<P>In the Isle of <HI>Man,</HI> there is a sort of Sea-Fowles called <HI>Puffins:</HI> <MILESTONE N="13"/> they are of a very unctious constitution, and breed in Cony-holes (the Conies leaving their burrows for that time) they are never seen with their young, but very early in the morning, and late in the evening: they nourish their young (as it is conceived) with Oil drawn from their own bodyes, and dropped into their mouths, for that be∣ing opened, there is found in their crops no other sustenance, save a single Sorrel-leaf, which the old give their young (as is conjectu∣red) for digestions-sake; the flesh of them whilst raw is not savoury, but powdered, it may bee ranked with Anchoves, and Caviare; pro∣fitable they are in their feathers, and oil, which they use much a∣bout their Wooll.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14"/> In the Isle of <HI>Mauritius</HI> is a Fowle called a <HI>Dodo:</HI> Her body is round, and extream fat, which makes her pace slow: few of them weigh less than fifty pound: Her wings are so small, that they cannot lift her above the ground: Her head is variously dressed, the one half hooded with downy black feathers, the other wholly naked, of a whitish colour, as if a transparent Lawn had covered it: her bill is very hooked, bending downwards, the breathing place being in the midst of it, from which part to the end, the colour is light green, mixt with a pale yellow: Her eyes are round, and small, and bright as Diamonds: her cloathing is of the finest down: her train is of three or four short feathers: her legs thick, and black: her tallons sharp: her stomach so hot, that shee digests stones, or Iron, as doth the <HI>Ostrich.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15"/> In <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> there is a Bird called a <HI>Dotterel,</HI> so named of his dol∣tish foolishness: Its a bird of an apish kinde, ready to imitate what it sees done: they are caught by Candle-light by the Fowlers ge∣stures: for if hee put forth an arm, they stretch forth a wing: if hee sets forward a leg, or hold up his head, they likewise do the same:
<PB N="215" REF="111"/>
In brief, whatsoever the Fowler doth, the same also doth this fool∣ish bird, untill it bee caught within the net. <HI>Camb. Brit.</HI> p. 543.</P>
<P>There is an Island called <HI>Bas,</HI> bordering upon <HI>Lathaien</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI><MILESTONE N="16"/> unto which there resort a multitude of Sea fowls, especially of <HI>Soland Geese,</HI> which bring with them such abundance of Fish, that, as it is reported, an hundred souldiers that lay there in Garrison for defence of the place, fed upon no other meat, but the fish that was thus brought to them: And the said Fowles also bring such a number of sticks, and twigs wherewith to build their nests, that thereby the in∣habitants are also abundantly provided of fewel for the fire: and such a mighty gain is made of their feathers, and oile, that no man would scarcely beleeve it, but hee that hath seen it. <HI>Camb. Brit. of Scotland.</HI> p. 12, 13.</P>
<P>In <HI>Magallanes</HI> voyage about the world, the King of the Island of <HI>Bacchian</HI> sent the King of <HI>Spain</HI> two dead birds of a strange shape:<MILESTONE N="17"/> they were as big as Turtle-Doves, with little heads, and long bills, long small legs, and no wings, but in stead thereof certain long fea∣thers of divers colours, and tails like Turtle-Doves: all their other feathers were of a tawny colour; they flye not, but when the wind blows, and they call them <HI>Birds of God.</HI> Pur. Pil. v. 1. p. 44.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sofala</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> is a kinde of bird called <HI>Minga,</HI> green,<MILESTONE N="18"/> and yellow, very fair, about the bigness of a Pigeon, which never treads on the ground, their feet being so short, that they can scarce bee discerned: they settle on trees, of the fruit whereof they live: when they drink they flye on the tops of the water; and if they fall on the ground they cannot rise again; their flesh is fat, and savourie. <HI>Idem.</HI> p. 1546.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The wonderful works of God in the Creatures. Of strange Beasts, and Serpents.</HEAD>
<P>WHilst Sir <HI>Thomas Row,</HI> our <HI>English</HI> Ambassador, was at the great <MILESTONE N="1"/> <HI>Moguls</HI> Court, hee saw many stately Elephants brought be∣fore the Emperor: some of which being <HI>Lord-Elephants</HI> (as they called them) had their chains, bells, and furniture of gold, and sil∣ver, each of them having eight, or ten other <HI>Elephants</HI> waiting on him: they were some twelve companies in all, and as they passed by, they all bowed down before the King very handsomely. <HI>Pur. Pil.</HI> v. 1. p. 550.</P>
<P>Though these <HI>Elephants</HI> be the largest of all beasts, yet are they very tractable, unless at such times when they are mad through lust:<MILESTONE N="2"/> some of them are thirteen, and some fifteen foot high; their colour is usually black, their skins thick, and smooth without hair; they de∣light much to bathe themselves in water, and are excellent swim∣mers,
<PB N="216" REF="112"/>
their pace is about three miles an hour; of all Beasts they are most sure of foot, so that they never stumble, or fall to indanger their rider: they lye down, and rise again at pleasure, as other beasts do; they are most docible creatures, doing almost whatsoever their Keeper commands them. If hee bid one of them afright a man, hee will make towards him, as if hee would tread him in peeces; and yet when hee comes at him, do him no hurt: If hee bid him abuse, or disgrace a man, hee will take dirt, or kennel-water in his trunk, and dash it in his face, &amp;c. Their trunks are long, grissely snouts hanging down betwixt their teeth, which (as a hand) they make use of upon all occasions. Some <HI>Elephants</HI> the great <HI>Mogul</HI> keeps for execution of malefactors; who being brought to suffer death by that mighty beast, if the Keeper bid him dispatch the offender pre∣sently, hee will immediatly with his foot pash him in peeces: If hee bid him torture him slowly, hee will break his joynts by degrees one after another, as men are broken upon the wheel.</P>
<P>An <HI>English</HI> Merchant of good credit being at <HI>Adsmeer</HI> (a City where <MILESTONE N="2"/> the great <HI>Mogul</HI> then was) saw a great <HI>Elephant</HI> daily brought through the Market-place, where an Hearb-woman used to give him an handful of herbs as hee passed by. This <HI>Elephant</HI> afterwards being mad, brake his chains, and took his way through the Market-place; the people being affrighted, hasted to secure themselves, a∣mongst whom was this Hearb-woman, who through fear, and haste, forgat her little childe. The <HI>Elephant</HI> comming to the place where shee usually sate, stopt, and seeing a childe lye about her hearbs, took it up gently with his Trunk, and without harm, laid it upon a stall hard by, and then proceeded in his furious course. <HI>Idem.</HI> p. 1472. The Males Testicles lye about his forehead: the Females teates are betwixt her fore legs; they carry their young two years in their wombs: conceive but once in seven years: they are thirty years be∣fore they come to their full growth, and fulfil the accustomed age of a man before they dye.</P>
<P>As <HI>Pyrrus</HI> King of <HI>Epyrus</HI> was assaulting the City of <HI>Argos,</HI> one of <MILESTONE N="3"/> of his <HI>Elephants</HI> called <HI>Nicon. i. e.

<P>The <HI>Lion</HI> hath the <HI>Jackall</HI> for his Usher, which is a little black, <MILESTONE N="4"/> shag-haired beast, of the bigness of a Spaniel, which when the even∣ing comes, hunts for his prey, and comming on the foot, follows the scent with open crye: to which the <HI>Lion</HI> as chief Hunt gives dili∣gent ear, following for his advantage: If the <HI>Jackall</HI> set up his chase before the <HI>Lion</HI> comes in, hee howles out mainly, and then the <HI>Lion</HI> seizeth on it, making a grumbling noise, whilst his servant stands

<P>The <HI>Panther</HI> hath a very sweet smell, so that other Beasts are much taken therewith, but they are terrified with the ugly deformity of his <MILESTONE N="5"/> face, and therefore as hee goes hee hides that part between his legs, and will not look towards them till hee hath gotten them within his compasse, which when hee hath done, hee devours them without mercy: so deals the Devil with wicked men, strewing their way to Hell with variety of worldly delights, and profits (the thorns of af∣flictions must not touch their flesh, nor hells terrors come within their thoughts) till hee hath made them past feeling, than hee devours them. <HI>Plin. nat.

<P>The <HI>Camelopardalus</HI> is the highest of Beasts, so that a man on horse∣back may ride upright under his belly, his neck is long, so that hee <MILESTONE N="7"/> usually feedeth upon the leaves of trees: his colour is white and speck∣led, his hinder legs are shorter than his former, so that he cannot graze but with difficulty. <HI>P.

<P>In <HI>India</HI> is a certain beast called a <HI>Buffelo,</HI> which is very large, hath a thick and smooth skin, but without hair: She gives good milk, and <MILESTONE N="8"/> her flesh is like beefe. <HI>Idem.</HI> p. 1469.</P>
<P>In the same Country also are certain wild Goats, whose horns are <MILESTONE N="9"/> good against poison. <HI>Pur. Pil.</HI> p. 472.</P>
<P>In the Country of <HI>Indostan</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> are large white <HI>Apes,</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/> as big as our Grey-hounds, which will eat young birds, whereupon Nature hath taught their Dams this subtilty: they build their Nests on the utmost boughs at the end of slender twigs: where they hang them like Purse-nets, to which the Apes cannot possibly come: yet many times with their hands they will shake those boughs til the nests break, and fall down, and then they will devour them. <HI>Pur.

<P>The <HI>Camelion</HI> is of the shape, and bigness of a <HI>Lizzard,</HI> it is a deform∣ed <MILESTONE N="11"/> lean, and crooked creature, having a long and slender tail, like a Mouse, and is of a slow pace. It lives only upon Flys. It changeth colours accor∣ding to the variety of places where it comes. It is a great enemy to venemous Serpents, for when it sees any lye sleeping under a Tree, it gets upon a bough just over the Serpents head, and voideth out of its mouth, as it were a long thred of Spittle, with a round drop hanging at the end, which falling on the Serpents head, immediately kills him. <HI>P.

<P>There was lately found in <HI>Catalunia,</HI> in the Mountains of <HI>Cerdania,</HI> a certain Monster, that had humane shape as far as the waste, and down∣wards <MILESTONE N="12"/> it was like a Satyre: Hee had many heads, Arms, and Eyes,

and a mouth of extraordinary bignesse, wherewith hee made a noise like a Bull: His picture was sent by <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> (now Governour of the <HI>Low Countryes)</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and after∣wards many Coppies thereof. were drawn, and sent abroad by Am∣bassadors, and other persons to several Princes, and States in <HI>Europe.

His head is small; and hath a thin snout: his mouth round, with a tongue three quarters of a yard long: hee is diligent in seeking Ant-hills, which hee tear∣eth with his claws, and then thrusts in his long tongue, upon which the Ants run, and when it is full hee licks them in, and this is all his food. <HI>Pur.

<P><MILESTONE N="14"/> The <HI>Armadillo</HI> is of the bignesse of a Pig, and of a white colour: It hath a long snout, and the body is covered with shels like Plates, wherwith they are armed: for they are so hard that no arrow will pierce them except in the Flanks, where they are softer: their flesh is good to eat, they dig holes in the ground with their snouts, in which they lye. <HI>Idem.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Porcupine</HI> hath bristles, or quils, white and black, of a span <MILESTONE N="15"/> and an half long, which they can cast: and they have this quality, that where one of these bristles enters into the flesh, if it bee not pulled out presently, it will work it self quite through, they are of a good flesh, and taste.</P>
<P>The <HI>Civet Cat</HI> exceeds the Castor for bignesse, her head is little, <MILESTONE N="16"/> her eyes cleer; hath a long muzzle; sharp, and offensive teeth. Her hair is parti-coloured, harsh, and bristley, yellow above, and whiter down∣wards; The pocket wherein the Civet is bred is neer the genitory, which is taken forth with a spoon or stick; But when shee is wild, shee casts it forth of her own accord, and by the sent it is found by the passengers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lyons</HI> in <HI>Affrick,</HI> are more fierce than in colder Countryes; here <MILESTONE N="17"/> was one of their skins brought into <HI>England,</HI> which from the snout to the top of the tail, contained one and twenty foot in length. They engender backwards as do Camels, Elephants, Rhinoceroses, Oun∣ces, and Tygers. They spare such men as prostrate themselves to them, and prey rather upon men than women, and not at all on In∣fants except compelled by hunger. His tail is his Scepter, by which hee expresses his passion. Hee shrinks not at danger, except some covert of woods hides him from witnesses, and then he will take the benefit of flight, which otherwise he seems to disdain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hyaena</HI> hath no joints in her neck, and therefore stirrs not her <MILESTONE N="18"/> neck, but with the bending of her whole body. Shee hath one conti∣nued tooth through her whole mouth.</P>
<P>In <HI>Africk</HI> are many wild Asles, whereof one male hath many females, <MILESTONE N="19"/> &amp; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s so jealous, that he bites off the stones of the young males, if the

<P>The <HI>Dabuh</HI> is a simple Creature, like to a Wolf, but that his legs <MILESTONE N="20"/> and feet are like to a mans, they which know his haunt, with a Taber, and singing will bring him out of his den, and captivate his ears with their Musick, whilst another captivateth his legs with a rope.</P>

<P>There is in <HI>Affrica</HI> a certain monster called <HI>Pongo,</HI> in the whole <MILESTONE N="23"/> proportion like unto a man, but that it is bigger. It hath a mans face, hollow eyes, long hair upon the brows, his face and ears be∣ing without hair: but his body is all hairy of a dunish colour, &amp;c. Hee differs from a man only in his legs which have no calves: hee goes always upright upon his legs, and carries his hands clasped in the nape of his neck, when hee walkes upon the ground: They use to sleep in trees, and live upon fruits and nuts, <HI>Idem.</HI> v. 2. p. 982.</P>
<P>In <HI>Congo</HI> there is a strange Creature as big as a Ram, that hath wings like a Dragon, a long tail, and great chaps, with diverse rows of <MILESTONE N="24"/> teeth: They feed upon raw flesh. <HI>Idem.</HI> p. 1003.</P>
<P>In <HI>Affrica</HI> there is a beast called a <HI>Dabuk,</HI> in bignesse, and shape re∣sembling <MILESTONE N="25"/> a Wolf, saving that his legs and feet are like a mans. Hee useth to rake dead men out of their graves, and eat them. <HI>Idem.</HI> p. 847.</P>
<P>In the Kingdome of <HI>Mexico</HI> there are <HI>Kine,</HI> with bunches on their backs, about the bignesse of our bulls, having little horns, and more <MILESTONE N="26"/> hair on their foreparts than behind, which is like Wooll: On the back bone they have manes like horses, and long hair from their Knees downward, with much long hair on their throats: They are meat, drink, shooes, houses, fire, vessels, and their masters whole substance.</P>
<P>Other Creatures there are as big as horses, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for <MILESTONE N="27"/> their fine wooll call Sheep: One of their horns usually weigheth fifty pounds. <HI>P. Pil.</HI> v. 4. p. 1561.</P>
<P>In <HI>Virginia</HI> is a beast called a <HI>Possown,</HI> the female whereof hath <MILESTONE N="28"/> a bag under her belly, from whence shee letteth forth her young ones, and taketh them in again at her pleasure. <HI>Idem.</HI> p. 1772.</P>
<P>In <HI>Socotera</HI> are Sheep, whose tails weigh twenty eight pounds a peece,<MILESTONE N="29"/> which therefore are usually cut off from the Ewes, least they should hin∣der their breeding.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Great Mogols</HI> Countrey there are <HI>Asses</HI> with horns, whereof <MILESTONE N="30"/> they make diverse sorts of drinking cups, of excellent vertue. Some judging them to be the right <HI>Unicorns</HI> horn. <HI>Idem.</HI> p. 436.</P>

<P>In the Island of <HI>Orknay</HI> the <HI>Ewes</HI> are of such fecundity, that they <MILESTONE N="32"/> bring forth constantly two, and many times three Lambs a peece; There bee neither ravenous, nor venemous creatures there, nor if transported thither, will they live in that Island. <HI>Description of Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P>There are three sorts of <HI>Camels:</HI> the first sort are gross, and tall <MILESTONE N="33"/> of stature: these will usually carry one thousand pound weight a peece, when they are to bee loaden, being beaten on the knees, and neck with a cudgel, they will kneel down, and when they feel their load sufficient, they will rise up again of themselves. The second sort of them have two bunches on their backs, and are fit either for bur∣then, or to ride on. The third sort are of a slender, and low stature, called <HI>Dromedaries,</HI> unfit for burthens, but they excel in swiftness, so that in the space of one day they will travel one hundred miles, and will so continue for eight, or ten dayes together, with very lit∣le provender; and they will abstain from drink eight, ten, and some∣times fifteen dayes together, without any inconvenience, as they tra∣vel through the Deserts.</P>
<P><HI>Musk</HI> is taken from a little reddish beast, that they beat with many <MILESTONE N="34"/> blows in one place, that so the blood may gather into it: and when the skin is by this means swolne, and full of blood, they binde it strait, that the blood may not issue forth, and being put into one, or more bladders, its dryed on the beasts back, till the bladder fall off of it self; and so that blood after a month becomes excellent musk. <HI>Pur. Pil.</HI> v. 2. p. 1500.</P>
<P>Amongst the <HI>Blackmoores,</HI> there is a strange beast called a <HI>Car∣buncle,</HI> <MILESTONE N="35"/> which is seen only by night, having a stone in his forehead that shineth incredibly, and giving him light whereby to feed: But when hee hears the least noise, hee presently lets fall over it a skin, which hee hath as a natural covering, least his splendor should betray him. <HI>Pur. Pil.</HI> v. 1. p. 416.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="36"/> In <HI>Abassia</HI> are Kine with horns like unto <HI>Harts</HI> horns: Others there bee that have but one horn in the midst of their foreheads of about a span and an half long, turning upward. <HI>Pur. Pil.</HI> v. 2. p. 1495.</P>
<P>There is in the Country of <HI>Mexico</HI> a kinde of sheep, which all <MILESTONE N="37"/> things considered is a beast of the greatest profit, and least charge that is: For from them they draw meat and cloathing: They use them also to carry all their burthens, having need neither of shooes nor saddles, nor yet of Oats, so that they serve their Masters for nought, feeding only on grass which they finde in the fields; There are two kindes of these creatures, the one bearing Wooll, the other are bare, which are the better for burthen; they are big∣ger than great Sheep, and less than Calves; they have long necks like a Cammel. They are of divers colours, some white, some black, and others grey, or spotted; Their flesh is good meat, but
<PB N="221" REF="114"/>
that of their Lambs is best: Of their Wooll the <HI>Indians</HI> make cloath some courser, other finer like half silk; they also make Carpets, and Coverings, and other exquisite works of it, which last long, and have a very good gloss; they die it into sundry colours: upon these the <HI>Spaniards</HI> carry their bars of silver; one of these sheep carrying about an hundred and fifty pound weight.</P>
<P>In the stomach, or belly of this beast, is found the <HI>Bezar's</HI> stone; <MILESTONE N="37"/> sometimes one alone, sometimes two, three, or four: They are different in form, greatness, and colour; some like Filbirds, others like Walnuts: Some as big as Pigeons Eggs, some as big as Hens Eggs: In form some are round, some oval, and of other forms. For their colour, some are black, some white, some grey, dark green, and some as if they had been gilded: they are all made of divers filmes, and skins one upon another. <HI>P. Pil.</HI> v. 3. p. 969.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Italy</HI> the <HI>Tarantula</HI> (a kinde of Serpent) the venome <MILESTONE N="38"/> whereof hath such an operation, that whosoever is stung with it, fal∣leth a dancing, and capering, and nothing can allay it but Musick. <HI>Raimunds Mercu. Ital.</HI></P>

four lines which hee beat with Ink, and printed them upon Paper, wherewith hee much joyed, and determined to find out another kind of Ink more fastening, and holding, and so with his Kinsman <HI>Thomas Peterse,</HI> found out another way to print whole Sheets, but of one side only, which are yet to bee seen in the said town: afterwards hee changed his Letters of Wood into Lead, and after that into Tin, and so by degrees this famous Art of Printing grew to perfection. <HI>Belg.
