<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader, at first View, may suppose this History to be written by some prejudiced hand, and therefore it may Savour of too much Partiality; but if he more deliberately consult the Actions of this Monarch, and the Reflexions the Cal∣mest Spirits of <HI>Europe,</HI> and even his own Subjects have made upon them, we hope the Censure may pass over us. For there be few who allow him not the Epithet of, <HI>Troubler of the Peace of Europe;</HI> in which least Part of the Earth, he has caused more Blood to be shed since his mounting the Throne of <HI>France,</HI> than many Ages before had seen, and made so many Towns and Villages sink in Fire, that no barbarous Nation dares venture to reckon with him on that score. <HI>Nero</HI> was a <HI>Hea∣then,</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>and yet we have him painted in the blackest shape, for setting Fire to <HI>Rome,</HI> and Persecuting the <HI>Chri∣stians.</HI> What then could have been expected from those Historians, had they been to set forth the Actions of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. who is styled, <HI>The Most Christian King,</HI> who has not only Destroyed one Town or City, but laid whole Countries and Provinces Waste, with Fire and Sword, Persecuted and Destroyed a Million of <HI>Christians,</HI> and joined with <HI>Infidels,</HI> to bring Destru∣ction even upon <HI>Christendom</HI> it self; and, as he Phrases it, <HI>Scorning to be a Slave to his Word,</HI> has counted the most sacred Leagues and Oaths as Tri∣fles, to be made and broken at pleasure, or things only framed to serve his pur∣pose, and no longer durable than his Interest requires. Therefore we hope the Candid Reader will not impute i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too great a Boldness in a Historian of these times, to lay down in a brief, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compact <HI>Series,</HI> undeniable Truths, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have attended his Birth and Reign.</P>

<HEAD>A VIEW of the LIFE and ACTIONS OF LEWIS XIV. The present King of <HI>France, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1-50" TYPE="pages">
<P>NOT doubting but many are unacquainted with the Life and Actions of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. of <HI>France,</HI> especially as to sundry Periods and Particulars; we have undertaken to compile what has materially happened relating to that Prince, who has for many Years, but especially of late, made such a noise and bluster in the World, to the damage and disturbance of all Christendom, and has, as it were, fat∣ted himself with Christian Blood.</P>
<P>After a tedious War between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> (which began in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and continued by Truces and Intervals in the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII.) nothing was thought more Expedient to put a stop to the Progress of those
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>Miseries that equally afflicted both King∣doms, than a Match; and, both Parties agreeing, a Marriage was made between <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. (styled by some <HI>The Just</HI>) and <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain:</HI> But although they were both in the Flower of Youth, they deceived for a long time the Expectation of the world, living together in mutual Society Twen∣ty-three Years, without any Appear∣ance of the Queen's ever being with Child. Insomuch, that <HI>France</HI> and all <HI>Europe</HI> suspected one or both of them Defective or Stiril; but at the end of these Years, when all were out of hopes, a Crotchet came into the Queen's Head, (supposed to be put into it by Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> who Ruled all at Court) To go in Pro∣cession barefooted to the Chapel of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> near <HI>Paris,</HI> whom the Pa∣pists hold for a very <HI>Lucina,</HI> to demand of her a Son and Heir to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI> And indeed, when a Man sends his Wife abroad to ask for a Child, 'tis but just she should bring one home with her, if she can get it. But, to the pur∣pose. As if this, as a Miracle, was to be ascribed to the <HI>Blessed Virgin,</HI> and an Effect of the Answer of the Queen's Prayers; according to the time of Child∣ing,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>the Queen was brought to bed of a Son in <HI>September,</HI> in the Year One thou∣sand six hundred thirty and eight. And, that the Miracle might be increased, or the better to hush some Scruples and Doubts in Court, the Parliament of <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> welcomed him into the World with the Salutation of <HI>Dieu donne,</HI> or <HI>Given of God;</HI> conceiving a Birth, as indeed all <HI>Europe</HI> did, (though perhaps in ano∣ther sense,) to be Miraculous, after so many Years passing over without any Child, and the Father at that time be∣ing Indisposed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Some things were whispered abroad at the Birth of this Prince, and although <HI>Mazarine</HI> laboured to still them, yet notwithstanding several of the Blood-Royal (who had promised themselves great Advantages upon the Death of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. who appeared to them very Infirm, as well in Body as Mind,) could not for∣bear speaking aloud. And as a presage of Cruelty, (as it happened to our King <HI>Richard</HI> III. of <HI>England,</HI> and others who have delighted in Blood,) This Prince, contrary to the Rules of Nature, was born with long and sharp Teeth; which made many of the Grandees of <HI>France</HI> look upon so unusual an Accident, as the
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>fore-runner of ill Luck to the World; and upon that consideration Monsieur <HI>Bassam∣peire,</HI> a very Judicious Man, and a great Favourite of the Father, wrote to the Bishop of <HI>Greenoble</HI> in these Words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>IN my last I gave you the good News of the Queen's being brought safe to Bed of a</HI> Dauphin. <HI>All that I tell you at present is, that her Majesty Recovers every Day, and the Child is strong and lusty, and seems to promise a long Life. There is one thing of him much taken notice of by some, That his Gums have Teeth pointing out already, and there is scarce a Woman that can suffer him to suckle. He sucks so eagerly, that he brings Blood with his Milk; and, upon this ac∣count, he has had two Nurses changed al∣ready. I pray God this may not be an ill Omen to</HI> France. <HI>We need Princes of a healing and mild Temper, Corrosives not a∣greeing with the good of this Monarchy. The Prince is to be named</HI> Lewis Dieu donne, (Given of God,) <HI>as his Majesty was plea∣sed yesterday to declare in Council. I am,</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<P>This Letter is found in the <HI>Cologne</HI> E∣dition of <HI>Mareschal Bassampeire</HI>'s Memoirs, page 134. in <HI>French.</HI> But to return:</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. made great Joy for the Birth of this Son, and all <HI>France</HI> shined with Fires of Triumph. And no sooner was he Christened, but he was Inaugu∣rated into his Principality, as <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and had given him his Officers and Attendents; the chief of which were his Governess, a Lady of a Mascu∣line Spirit, and <HI>Hardovine de Perefexi,</HI> who since obtained to be Bishop of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and after that Archbishop of <HI>Paris.</HI> This Man served in the nature of his Tutor, being very cunning and politick.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. lay in the Cradle, as we may term it, nothing of Weight or Moment can be expected. But scarce was he capable of distinguishing Right from Wrong, before the Sceptre of <HI>France</HI> dropp'd into his Hand: For <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. declining more and more, at the End of Four Years and a few Months af∣ter the Birth of this Son, left the Stage of this World to sleep with his Ance∣stors. He was the Eldest Son of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> to whom the House of <HI>Valois</HI> had given Place, by the Death of <HI>Henry</HI> III. who was slain
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>by one <HI>Clement,</HI> a <HI>Jocobine Monk,</HI> with a Consecrated Dagger, in his Tent, when surrounded by his Army. His Mother was <HI>Mary de Medicis,</HI> of the House of <HI>Medici</HI> of <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>The King, before his Death, publish∣ed a Declaration, bearing Date <HI>April</HI> 12. 1643; by Virtue of which he appointed the Queen as Regent during the Minority of his Son, as likewise Governess of the Kingdom; and the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> was made her Lieutenant. The Chief of the Council, were the Prince of <HI>Con∣de,</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> the latter swaying all with the Queen, Monsieur <HI>Seguire,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>France,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Bauthlier,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Chauvigny:</HI> And the Conduct of the Army on Foot, was given to the Duke of <HI>Enguin,</HI> after∣ward Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI> So that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. giving up the Ghost on the Four∣teenth of <HI>May</HI> 1643. this Order pre∣vented the Contests that would have happened in the Court about Priority. However a Calm did not ensue; for the King was no sooner in his Grave, but Discontents, that in respect to him seemed stifled, broke out; both People and Grandees being dissatisfied with the Cardinal's management of Affairs, and
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>too great Influence upon the Queen, who Acted all by his Advice; and he being an <HI>Italian,</HI> proceeded to impose an <HI>Italian</HI> Government in many things, which were highly disgusted. So that they proclaimed their displeasures at the Head of an Army, with the Noise of Trumpets, Drums, and the thundering of Cannon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> taking the Advantage, endeavoured to enlarge their Dominions in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> where <HI>Don Francisco de Melo</HI> the <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> besieged <HI>Rocroy;</HI> but his Army was beaten off by the Duke of <HI>En∣guin,</HI> General of the <HI>French</HI> Forces, and a considerable Defeat given them, which happened six days after <HI>Lews</HI> XIV. came to the Throne. And to flush him with this Success, the Colours taken were spread before him at <HI>Paris,</HI> and several Applauses of Triumph made. And, to say true, this Victory proved a Check to <HI>Spain,</HI> and gave the <HI>French</HI> Army an Opportunity to enter into their Ter∣ritories, and take several Towns and Fortresses, as <HI>Maubeuge, Borlemont, Aim∣merikt, Binch,</HI> and <HI>Thionville,</HI> with o∣thers. Yet the small Castle of <HI>Cirke,</HI> stopped the Course of the <HI>French,</HI> who before rolled on like a Torrent, to the
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>endangering of all <HI>Flanders.</HI> But they had not the like Success in <HI>Germany;</HI> fore there the Mareschal <HI>de Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>briant,</HI> General of the <HI>French</HI> Forces, was slain, and his Army worsted, with the loss of a great many brave Men, which drew off <HI>Enguin</HI> from <HI>Flanders.</HI> But how∣ever, the War ceased not, for the War with <HI>Spain</HI> engaged most of the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> in the Quarrel. The Trum∣pets carried the Noise of War round the Borders of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as likewise in <HI>Italy, Navar, Catalonia, Germany, Alsatia, Flanders,</HI> and other Places. Nor were the Seas free from Blood; for the Duke of <HI>Breze,</HI> being Admiral for the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Straights,</HI> he twice engaged the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet. Nor did this War end without Rivers of Blood, Burnings, Plunderings, and great Devastations; and then the Misery it had occasioned in <HI>Europe</HI> moved the Princes to send their <HI>Plenepotentiaries</HI> to <HI>Munster,</HI> to compose the Differences, and agree a general Peace. For the Countries were so wa∣sted and Impoverished in many Places, that more died by Famine, than the Sword; so that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. began early to build his aspiring Greatness upon Ruine and Desolation, which threat∣ned
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>the World with a turbulent Prince.</P>
<P>To this Treaty, which was absolute∣ly necessary for the preventing an uni∣versal Famine, the Queen Regent of <HI>France</HI> sent the Count <HI>d' Avaux,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Servien,</HI> to manage the Inte∣rest of <HI>France;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Longue∣ville</HI> soon after followed them. So that, after many Debates, and the Interposi∣tion of the uninterested Princes, on the Twenty fourth of <HI>October</HI> 1648. a Peace was concluded, and the Monarchs of <HI>Europe</HI> agreed to lay down their Arms, that Plenty might be restored by Peace. And this had been done sooner, had not the <HI>French,</HI> according to their accustom∣ed Manner, (even in the midst of a Treaty, when others depending upon the publick Faith thought themselves secure,) surprized several Places, and suddenly brought their Arms into <HI>Ger∣many, Lorrain, Flanders, Catalonia,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> at once; as they did early in the <HI>Spring,</HI> 1645. which so exasperated the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they requited it before the Peace was concluded, by setting upon the <HI>French</HI> Fleet over against <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> putting it to Flight, with the loss of a great many Men, and some Vessels; the Admiral being killed with
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>a Cannon Bullet, and the Mareschal <HI>de Gassion,</HI> a great General of <HI>France,</HI> as he laid Siege to <HI>Lens,</HI> was wounded, and being carried to <HI>Arras,</HI> there died; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> recovered many consi∣derable Towns in <HI>Flanders</HI> and other Places, as <HI>Fuens, Courtray,</HI> and <HI>Lens;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Army suffered very much. However, the Peace held not in <HI>France;</HI> for the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> with divers o∣thers of the First Quality, being grieved that <HI>Mazarine</HI> (once a poor Priest and of mean Birth) should play the King of <HI>France,</HI> making his young Pupil, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. do what he pleased, Impoveri∣shing likewise the Kingdom, by sending vast Treasures into <HI>Italy,</HI> to enrich his poor Kindred; insomuch, that his Fa∣ther, who had never seen such Summs before, imagined it rained Gold in <HI>France:</HI> These things, I say, and the In∣solence of that proud Priest, made them take up Arms to Reform Abuses in the Government, publishing their <HI>Manifesto's</HI> to justifie their Proceedings, and remove the <HI>Cardinal</HI> from the Young King. So that the great City of <HI>Paris</HI> declared for them, resolving to defend their Interest to the utmost, as did many other Towns. Insomuch, that the Crown
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>was visibly at Stake; nor could the <HI>Car∣dinal</HI>'s Policy have saved it, had not the Courage and prudent Conduct of the Mareschal <HI>de Turin</HI> put a stop to the Progress of their Arms, whereby he be∣came a great Instrument of keeping <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> in his Throne, who else had by this time been Little and Insi∣gnificant. But in what manner he re∣quited him, the Sequel will demon∣strate.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> after much Blood-shed in an intestine War, retrea∣ted into <HI>Flanders,</HI> with divers of his Party, who would not leave him, and there was set at the Head of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces. Whereupon Hostilities ensued, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> recovered a great many of the Towns that had been taken from them. So that where Force could not prevail, Insinuation and Flattery took place, and at last the Prince was gained upon to return Home, as did the Dukes of <HI>Conti</HI> and <HI>Longueville,</HI> being highly Caressed; and a Pardon was published to all that had been in the Civil War; and <HI>Lewis,</HI> who hitherto had acted no∣thing memorable in his own Person, being arrived at the Thirteenth Year of his Age, <HI>Anno</HI> 1651, he was declared
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>to be of sufficient Years to take upon him the Government, and to act in Person, which Declaration was approved by the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and Proclaimed throughout the Kingdom. Yet the War continued with <HI>Spain,</HI> and many Battels were fought, and Towns lost and won, things being carried on with various Success. So that the King, that he might say he had been on Horse-back, got up at the Head of his Troops, to shew him∣self to the People, which did indeed give a little hopes to those that were ready to revolt, that things might go better than they had done. But how they were mistaken, will appear in its proper place.</P>
<P>In the Year 1654 great Preparations were made to Crown <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navar,</HI> and on the Fourth of <HI>June</HI> the Court arrived at <HI>Rhemes,</HI> and was received by about Two thousand of the Citizens on Horseback, about a League from that place; to which was made a Guard of about Five thousand of the Inhabitants in Arms, and the Sub∣urbs were crouded with the Soldiery. At the Entry were divers Triumphal Arches, beautified with golded Lilies, and many flattering Devices, the Streets
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>being hung with Tapestry, and other Or∣naments. And upon his approach the Cannons were thundred off, and volleys of small Shot discharged; and the Alder∣men of the City taking him for some petty Deity, fell on their Knees, and in that posture presented him the Silver Keys of the Town: And Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> be∣ing at the Church of <HI>Nostrodame</HI> with the Clergy, the King alighted there. The Bishop of <HI>Soissons</HI> officiated in the stead of the Archbishop of <HI>Rhemes,</HI> who was a little before dead, the Bishop of <HI>Caesaria</HI> being his Coadjutor. The Bi∣shops of <HI>Noyon</HI> and <HI>Beauvais</HI> attended in their Pontificals, the first making an O∣ration, in which he gave the King many flattering Epithets, scarce due to mor∣tal Man. However, knowing that Air of Vanity possessed his Mind, that makes him value himself much upon his own Praises, nothing was omitted that a Court-parasite could industriously pro∣duce. Then the Archdeacon did the like, and the Deacon gave him a <HI>Mis∣sal</HI> to kiss, who kneeled down upon two Velvet Cushions, placed on a Foot-cloath under a Canopy of State; and from thence he went unto the Choire to assist at the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> and the <HI>Vespers</HI> were performed in Musick.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
<P>The <HI>Vespers</HI> over, he went to the Arch∣bishop's Palace, which was prepared to receive him; and the next day the Co∣ronation was Solemnized with great Pomp, the Queen-Mother of <HI>England,</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Gloucester</HI> being present. And there he was annointed with the <HI>Holy Oil,</HI> which the Priest makes the ignorant People believe, was miraculously sent from Heaven, on pur∣pose to annoint their Kings, that they may be the more Dreaded and Reve∣renced.</P>
<P>And now this spruce young <HI>Monsieur</HI> being on the Throne, began to make some Figure in the World, though he still acted by others Heads and Advice. And to give the World a proof of <HI>French</HI> Fidelity, he clapp'd up a Peace, contra∣ry to all Mens Expectation, with <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Protector, at the time when King <HI>Charles</HI> II. with his two Brothers were at the <HI>French</HI> Court, and had been promised, not only Protection, but also aid to regain the usurped King∣doms of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland, &amp;c.</HI> Nor was this all, but he procee∣ded more treacherously with his near Kinsmen; for in the Treaty, amongst other things, there was an Article, to
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>Banish them <HI>France,</HI> and its Territories. Of which King <HI>Charles</HI> having private Notice, and finding it fruitless to com∣plain where the Royal engagement was so little regarded, to avoid a ceremo∣nious Expulsion, with generous disdain he turned his Back upon that ungrateful Court, and with his faithful Followers, as Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and other Nobles, he retired into <HI>Germany,</HI> and was there re∣ceived with all imaginable Joy, and found amongst Strangers that Reception, without any promise or word given, which his Cousin of <HI>France</HI> had so gene∣rously promised, and afterward so base∣ly denied. But his Brothers, the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Gloucester,</HI> stayed behind; the first having a Command in the Army, under Maresch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <HI>de Turin,</HI> against the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> But that weighed nothing; for the League being made, he was or∣dered to be Packing. Nay, it went so far, that a Message was sent to their Mo∣ther, though Daughter to <HI>Henry the Great</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> to be gone; but she sent Word, <HI>That she knew her Right to be in</HI> France, <HI>if the King knew not what be∣longed to his Dignity; and that a Daughter of</HI> Henry <HI>IV. from whom he was descended, and held the Crown, was not so easily ex∣pelled
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>from her Native Country.</HI> This re∣solute Answer of the Queen's, made <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. dissemble the Matter, and her stay was winked at, though not ap∣proved.</P>
<P>Here you may see <HI>French</HI> Faith to di∣stressed Princes, who though never so near Ally'd to that King, could obtain Refuge no longer than his Interest mo∣ved him to break his Promises. And this early beginning has been very much improved, as will appear in the Series of this History.</P>
<P>The League Offensive and Defensive being made with <HI>England</HI> against <HI>Spain,</HI> Six thousand Men were sent into <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> who beat the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and took <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> whilst the <HI>French,</HI> in a manner, stood still, and looked on. For, as an Historian of their own truly has it, <Q REND="margQuotes">Though <HI>France</HI> abound with Men, it is wont to make use of the Valour of its Neighbours in all Wars against Strangers. For it hath (continues he) been found by Experience, That the <HI>French</HI> are only for the first Onset, but cannot abide, nor weather so many Discouragements as the <HI>English, Scots,</HI> and <HI>Switzers</HI> can in War. Besides, their Foot are not to be compared to
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>Strangers, therefore they may ascribe their most difficult Conquests to their Money, and the Valour of the <HI>English, Scotch, Irish,</HI> and <HI>Switzers.</HI></Q></P>
<P>According to the Treaty, <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was secured by the <HI>English.</HI> For the crafty <HI>Protector</HI> not being ignorant of the Fals∣hood of the <HI>French</HI> Court, had given secret Orders to <HI>Lockhart,</HI> who Com∣manded in Chief, immediately upon sur∣render to enter it, and Post his Men there, and even to dispute it with the <HI>French,</HI> if it was not quietly put into their Hands. However, though <HI>Ma∣zarine</HI> and his Pupil had a great Mind to this strong and important Place, yet at that time they were forced to let it slip through their Fingers, as well knowing the <HI>Protector</HI> had a powerful Army on Foot in <HI>England.</HI> But, some time after, they found means to Charm it from us with <HI>French</HI> Gold, to the great endama∣ging of our Shipping which Trade on that Coast.</P>
<P>In the Year 1656. the <HI>French</HI> relying upon their own Strength, at the remark∣able Siege of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> received a great Overthrow. But the <HI>English</HI> had better Success; for whilst the <HI>French</HI> stood looking on, and concluded it utter∣ly
<PB N="18" REF="13"/>impossible, Sir <HI>Thomas Morgan,</HI> who Commanded the <HI>English</HI> Forces, Stormed <HI>Mardike,</HI> recovering the Top of the Walls almost before they were expected, passing through showers of Bullets and Fire, to the Astonishment both of the <HI>French,</HI> and the Besieged, and possessed themselves of that strong Fortress, and after that they saved it from a Surprize, attempted by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the dead of the Night. And indeed, most of the Towns that were taken, during this War, may be justly ascribed to the <HI>English</HI> Va∣lour; which Valour peradventure <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. may one day Experience in the Heart of <HI>France,</HI> as several of his Predecessors have done.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> grown weary of this War, the usual way of Accommodation was proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> a Match between the <HI>Spanish Infanta,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King. This Match was greatly opposed by <HI>Ma∣zarine,</HI> who concluded, if a Peace ensu∣ed, and the King gave himself up to the Embraces of a Young Wife, his Autho∣rity would be lessened. But the Queen-Mother declared resolutely for it; say∣ing, <HI>That whether he would or no, it should be done; for that her Son should marry one of her Kinswomen.</HI> But this had like to
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>have broken off by the Sickness of <HI>Lewis,</HI> which every one concluded would termi∣nate in his Death. Whereupon Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> knowing the many Villainies he had committed in <HI>France,</HI> and the Mis∣chief done by his Evil Council, was about to pack up his Awls and trudge for <HI>Italy;</HI> fearing, if the King should die, he should fall a Sacrifice to the Fury of the Rab∣ble. And thereupon he sent a Gentle∣man to the Mareschal <HI>de Turin,</HI> to know if he might have a safe Retreat in the Army, till he could otherways shift for himself. But that Protestant General re∣turned him so cold an Answer, that he was put out of all Hopes. However, whilst he was studying what to do, the King began to recover; and accordingly esca∣ped that Death that threatned him, to be the cause of the Death and Ruine of more than a Million of People.</P>
<P>The King being Recovered, <HI>Mazarine</HI> was sent to <HI>Bayon,</HI> and <HI>Don Louis d' Ardo de Gusman</HI> came to Saint <HI>Sebastians,</HI> the more commodiously to treat about the Peace, being constituted for that end <HI>Plenepotentiaries.</HI> And accordingly it was concluded on sundry Articles, to the great Joy of the Frontier-Towns, who by Burning, Plundering, Quartering Sol∣diers,
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>and Contributions, were redu∣ced to extream Misery. And <HI>Lewis</HI> sent a Procurator to <HI>Don Louis d'Ardo,</HI> in his Name to Espouse the <HI>Infanta,</HI> and the Marriage was consummated at <HI>Fonterabia,</HI> in the presence of the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> and the two Kings met in the <HI>Isle of Con∣ference,</HI> situate between both Kingdoms, where <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> was delivered to <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France</HI> as his Wife, and both Kings solemnly swore to keep and confirm to one another the Treaty of Peace, and the Young Queen entered <HI>Paris</HI> in an open Chariot, shining with the Treasure of both the <HI>Indias.</HI> But Card. <HI>Mazarine</HI> for Grief to see his Purpose crossed, as some gave out, fell sick, and died on the Nine∣teenth of <HI>March</HI> 1661. to the Joy of all <HI>France;</HI> to whom he had a long time been a Scourge, and instilled that Spirit of Cruelty into <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. that has since been manifested to the World in Cha∣racters of Blood.</P>
<P>This Cardinal had his first Rise under <HI>Richelieu,</HI> the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardinal of <HI>France,</HI> and from a mean Birth raised himself and his Family to the greatest Dignity <HI>France</HI> could afford a Subject. He was born an <HI>Itaelian,</HI> and by his cunning bore himself up in the Favour of this King
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>and his Father, in spight of all the migh∣ty Opponents he met withal. For be∣side the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> Duke of <HI>Conti,</HI> and most of the Nobles; he stood the Envy of the People in general, whom he had sorely vexed by Taxes and Oppres∣sions. The Court went into Mourning for him, but continued it not long; for, an occasion of Joy soon after made it vanish. The Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> falling in Love with the beautiful Daughter of <HI>Charles</HI> I. of <HI>England,</HI> the Lady <HI>Henrietta,</HI> at the publick Ceremory of that illustrious Marriage the Mourning went off.</P>
<P>Thus far we have traced this Monarch, as we may term it, in his Leading-strings. For the Cardinal, whilst he lived, had the absolute Rule of his Mind, what∣ever share he had in his Body; and from thence we may hitherto conclude him an Engine, that moved by the Dictates of that covetous and ambitious Prelate; but for the future we must consider him moving more directly in his own Sphere. It is observed of <HI>Nero,</HI> by <HI>Suetonius</HI> and others, That the beginning of his Reign, was tolerable, and not comparable to those Cruel and Irregular practices that followed, and left a Lasting stain upon him to all Posterity.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>
<P>Notwithstanding the terrible Name <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. supposed to have gained in the year 1662, his Ambassador contending with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador for Prece∣dency, at the Reception of another Am∣bassador near the <HI>Tower,</HI> was there wor∣sted, had several of his Horses, and some of his Attendence killed and wounded. For the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Council not undertaking to determine in this Matter, they were left to di∣spute it; and a Proclamation was put out, forbidding any <HI>English</HI> to meddle in this Matter, upon great Penalties; so that the Ambassador of <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> appear'd but very Little, being forced to sneak to his Lodging by all the by-Ways he could find, though they pre∣tend to claim Precedency of all the Am∣bassadors of <HI>Europe</HI> unless at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> where the Lords of <HI>Austria</HI> bear Rule. Yet this made <HI>Monsieur</HI> to storm and bluster at a strange rate, insomuch, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> being of a quiet disposition, and not desirous to involve himself in another War, gave him such satisfaction as contented him upon his sending complaints to <HI>Madrid,</HI> preferring the Quiet of his Kingdoms be∣fore a Punctilio of Honour. Which so
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>puffed up the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> that he had a great Mind to be Quarrelling with <HI>En∣gland;</HI> and not well knowing how to be∣gin, he pitched upon a peremptory de∣mand of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> that was then in the Hands of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. This De∣mand was looked upon by the <HI>French</HI> themselves as so Extravagant, that they could not imagine the <HI>English</HI> would hearken to the delivery of a place gain∣ed with the loss of the Lifes of so many brave Men, and extreamly strengthened and fortified, at the Expence of vast Treasure, lying at the same time so Commodious for Trade, and other Ad∣vantages.</P>
<P>The pretences the <HI>French</HI> King made were, That there was an Agreement with <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> that upon the Pay∣ment of a certain Summ of Money, it should be delivered to the <HI>French.</HI> But no body, as we can hear of, was privy to this Contract but himself. However, contrary to all Mens Expectation, his <HI>French</HI> Pistols gained that strong Town, which all the Cannon and Forces of <HI>France,</HI> had the King of <HI>England</HI> de∣fended it, could never have done. But now we Experience the damage of that Oversight, when too Late. For <HI>Dun∣kirk</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>was delivered for Money, and <HI>Lewis</HI> had the unexpected Pleasure of entering into it in Triumph, on the Second of <HI>December,</HI> in the Year 1662.</P>
<P>These Successes flushed his Ambition to greater Attempts, nothing less now than the <HI>Dukedom</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> will serve his turn, and thereupon he sent his cun∣ning Sophisters to wheedle the Duke out of it by Threats and Promises. First, That he had an Army ready to fall into it, if it were refused. Secondly, That he would consign him Lands more secure in Lieu of it in another place. And, to make the old Duke more fond, promi∣sed to declare him Heir to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> in Case the Family of <HI>Bourbon</HI> failed, although there was a <HI>Dauphin</HI> born of the young Queen. These, and other inveiglings between Force and fair Means, wrought so powerfully, that the Agreement was made the Sixth of <HI>Febru∣ary</HI> 1662. and in <HI>March</HI> following con∣firmed in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> to the apparent Wrong of Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> the present Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> who, though of years, was no ways consenting to his Father's Act. And upon this Agreement, the <HI>French</HI> Troops were immediately sent, who seized upon all the Cities and
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>Country of that fertil and spacious <HI>Duke∣dom,</HI> except <HI>Marsal,</HI> which being gari∣soned and influenced by the young Prince, opposed their Progress. This made <HI>Monsieur</HI> storm and immediately he or∣dered his <HI>Generals</HI> to be ready for an Ex∣pedition, to make War, as he term'd it, for the Glory of his Arms; and came on so terribly in the Head of his Forces, that the old Duke, though he repented of what he had done, foreseeing the ru∣ine that would insue to his People if he opposed, and being altogether unfur∣nished, by the surprize of his Towns, to Encounter a great Army, thought it his best way to submit to his Misfortune. And thereupon, in an humble manner he went to <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>Lorrain</HI> to excuse himself to <HI>Lewis,</HI> who received the vene∣rable old Man after a haughty manner, and would hear of nothing but the sur∣render of <HI>Marsal;</HI> which not being a∣ble to hold out against such a powerful Army, as he had brought into the Coun∣try, it was put into <HI>French</HI> hands on the Third of <HI>September</HI> 1663.</P>
<P>Much about this time, <HI>Lewis</HI> fell a ca∣velling, like an Unchristian Son, with his <HI>Holy Father</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Manner was thus. <HI>Monsieur de Crequi,</HI> his Am∣bassador
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>in that City, bearing himself with too high a hand, and putting A∣buses even upon the <HI>Pope</HI> himself, it so enraged some of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Guards, that (whether willingly, or by chance, remains doubtful) a <HI>Harquibus</HI> was shot into his Coach, which wounded some of his Ser∣vants. This Affront made such a noise in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> that <HI>Lewis,</HI> in∣stead of going in Devotion, immedi∣ately prepared to make a Procession to <HI>Rome</HI> with his Dragoons, which so frighted Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> II. that then held the Chair, that he was forced to send and meet his Army with Prote∣station of his Trouble for what had hap∣pened, and that he should have any sa∣tisfaction. This stopped his Carier a little, and <HI>Pisa</HI> was pitched upon as the City to examine the matter. And on the Twelfth of <HI>March</HI> 1664. it was agreed between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI>'s Deputies, (a thing that the Pride of the <HI>Popes</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> never submitted to for ma∣ny Hundred years;) <HI>viz,</HI> that <HI>Flavio Chigi,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Nephew, should come to the King, and beg the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Par∣don, (so that it seems, the <HI>Great Par∣doner</HI> was forced to creep at this Time for a pardon from one of his Sons.)
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>And farther, That a Monument should be raised in the place where the Affront was done, with an Inscription, decla∣ring the Cause of its being erected. This was performed, but it did not sa∣tisfie: For whilst it was a doing, the <HI>French</HI> fell into the <HI>Pope</HI>'s County <HI>Pala∣tine</HI> of <HI>Avignon,</HI> drove out the Garrisons, and without respect to St. <HI>Peter, Mo∣ther-Church,</HI> or Father <HI>Pope,</HI> plundered his Patrimony; for which the <HI>most Chri∣stian King</HI> highly applauded them. But soon after, the Queen-Mother of <HI>France</HI> died; and now <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. began to take his pleasure without Regard to the young Queen. Wherefore, though it may be looked upon as a digression, it may not be amiss to see a few of <HI>Lewis the Great's</HI> Intrigues with his Little Mi∣stresses; for you must understand, his Inclinations have been as well to Love as Glory.</P>
<P>Since <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. was Married to <HI>Maria Theresa</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> daughter of <HI>Spain,</HI> the first Mistress (though the Queen was charming enough, young, brisk, and lively,) that he publickly owned, was Madam <HI>de la Valliere,</HI> and that she might come up the better to his Humour, he made her Duchess of <HI>Vau∣jour.</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>And although the Queen grew jealous, and the Queen-Mother very much reproved his over-fondness of this Woman, yet he little regarded their Reproaches. Whereupon they used ma∣ny devices to draw off his Affections, but those not succeeding, one <HI>Father A∣nat,</HI> a Jesuit, and at that time his Con∣fessor, was prevailed upon to reprove him. So that he took upon him boldly to represent to him the Scandal, and bad Effects such a loose way of Living occasioned, by making an ill Impression upon the Minds of the People, and that if, he did not Reform, he must enjoin him sharper Penance at his next Con∣fession. But <HI>the most Christian King,</HI> lit∣tle satisfied with this Discourse, coldly replyed, <HI>That he thanked him kindly for his good Advice, and his past Service, but that for the future, he would make use of no other Confessor, but the Parson of the Parish.</HI> And so the old Fellow was turned out of Service for his Ill timed Preachment, which made the Society of <HI>Jesuits</HI> curse him for being so scurvy a Politician, on such an occasion; which he might have Improved to their Advantage. But however, though this was Cashiered, yet others of the Society, more cunning
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>and facetious, made a shift to creep in∣to the King's Bosome, making their own Advantages by embroiling a great part of <HI>Europe.</HI> And the more to flatter his Ambition, contrary to the Rules of their Order they took away the Name of <HI>Jesus</HI> from off the Gates of one of their Colleges in <HI>Paris,</HI> and placed the King's Name instead of it, which occasioned this Distich.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Abstulit hinc <HI>Jesum,</HI> posuit{que} <HI>Insignia Regis</HI></L>
<L>Impia Gens, Alium non habet Illa <HI>Deum.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They Jesus name have ta'en from their Aboad,</L>
<L>And plac'd the King's, he only is their God.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>After a long Caressing of this Mistress, (by whom he had some Children, and is said, in a great Immergency, to play the Man-Midwife to one of them himself,) and Entertaining her with all the Glo∣ry and Gallantry of his Kingdom, he grew weary of those Beauties-himself had sullied, and searched for those that were fresher. Whereupon he cast his Eyes upon Madam <HI>Montespan,</HI> who char∣med his Affections a very considerable time; which so vexed the former to see her self outed, that she went into a Nun∣nery,
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>and there turned Penitent, leaving the King to take his full swinge with <HI>Montespan,</HI> who made her Advantage by preferring all her Kindred to places of Honour and Trust. Her Brother, who would otherways have never deser∣ved it, was made <HI>Duke,</HI> and <HI>Peer General</HI> of the Galleys, and a <HI>Mareschal</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> These Qualifications rendered him of the greatest Quality for a Subject in the King∣dom, which caused a pretty Retort, when one was comparing this <HI>Vivone</HI> with <HI>Feillade, viz.</HI> that the last was made <HI>Mareschal</HI> by the Sword, and the first by the Scabbard. Yet many were of Opinion that the Kings passion was not so great for <HI>Montespan</HI> as he pretended; for if fame be true, one Madam <HI>Du Lude,</HI> a Nun of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> came in with her for a share, though privately, to save the Credit of that Order; which occasioned these following Verses.</P>
<Q><L><HI>La Valliere</HI> of common Race,</L>
<L><HI>Montespan</HI> of Noble was,</L>
<L>And <HI>Du Lude</HI> a pious Nun,</L>
<L>All for Mistresses are Known;</L>
<L>If you'd know the Reason why</L>
<L>These three his Favourites he creates,</L>
<L>Our great Prince has a mind to try</L>
<L>To Ʋnite the three Estates.</L></Q>
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>
<P>But his mind continued wavering; for not long after <HI>Montespan</HI> was laid aside, and <HI>Madamosel de Fontagne</HI> was taken in∣to Favour; but she lived not long after∣ward, as being supposed to have received a Dose from her she had rivalled: and the Prince of <HI>Marsilack,</HI> who brought her to the King, was, for finding the Game so well, made <HI>Chief Huntsman</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> To her succeeded <HI>Madam de Maintenon,</HI> who joining with <HI>Montespan,</HI> as a Testimony of their Repentance, built the Abby of St. <HI>Cry,</HI> by some called the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> to train up young Women: Which occasioned this Epigram;
<Q><L>Two of fair <HI>Venus</HI>'s Votaries,</L>
<L>Their Souls with holy Zeal inflam'd,</L>
<L>Have founded two new Nunneries</L>
<L>With the Revenues by their Pleasure gain'd.</L>
<L>But, without Miracle, they seem</L>
<L>To be in a pitious taking,</L>
<L>Since that that founded and supporteth them</L>
<L>Is now in a continual shaking.</L></Q></P>
<P>But to cut off this Digression, if it may properly be so termed, as to what is consistent to History of this Nature, we find that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. was not satisfied with having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> delivered to him;
<PB N="32" REF="20"/>but dreading the Growing Greatness of his <HI>Protestant</HI> Neighbours, <HI>viz. England,</HI> and the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> by some extra∣ordinary Contrivance they were set toge∣ther by the Ears, and engaged in an Un∣happy War, occasioning much blood∣shed on either Part, whilst <HI>France</HI> was a looker on. But when that Court per∣ceived the <HI>Dutch</HI> inclined to a Peace, as being wearied with an Expensive and hazardous War; then, and not till then, the <HI>French</HI> put in to assist the <HI>States,</HI> to keep the flame still blazing; that so the two most powerful Nations at Sea under Heaven, might weaken each other, and thereby lay themselves more open and exposed to the Projects of <HI>France,</HI> which has but too apparently been manifested. For, although in the Year 1666. the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was abroad, yet it was on∣ly in a bravado; for we could never learn from any hand, That that Fleet (though the Ships carried many terrible Names, as <HI>Tempest, Lightning, Thunder,</HI> &amp;c.) effected any thing; but rather stood as a looker on, whilst the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> battered each other; though at the same time they might have come up, the Wind being favourable. Nor were the <HI>English</HI> better served when they
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>were on their part, as will hereafter ap∣pear: So that if there was not (as let those believe who are very credulous, if they please,) a design in it for the weakning the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest; at least we may conclude, That this produced nothing as to the Reputation of making War, for the Glory of the Arms of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. However, after several Fights, and much Blood-shed, though little or none of the <HI>French</HI> in these Acti∣ons, upon more deliberate Considerati∣ons, a Peace was concluded in 1668. Yet in this Interim, there are other Re∣marks than what we have mentioned.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> during this <HI>Naval</HI> War, had not the Courage to make any de∣scent upon <HI>England,</HI> or any of the Three Kingdoms; but upon our People in the <HI>West-Indias</HI> their Treachery appeared in a Crimson dye, especially in the Island of St. <HI>Christophers;</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> as planters of that Island, had lived together in neighbourly Love, as every one thought, for many years, re∣ciprocally and with much satisfaction enjoying the Fruits of their Labour. But upon Notice of this War, and the iustigation of <HI>French</HI> Popish Cruelty, they fell unawares upon the <HI>English,</HI> and
<PB N="34" REF="21"/>Massacred them without mercy, or so much as giving them time to think of a future State, seizing upon their Goods and Possessions, to the eternal Infamy of the <HI>French</HI> Nation. They likewise sei∣zed upon the Islands of <HI>Antigo,</HI> Saint <HI>Eu∣stach,</HI> and <HI>Tobago.</HI> Yet all this while the Court of <HI>France</HI> pretended they had no Quarrel against the <HI>English,</HI> but what they did was in the defence of their Al∣lies, pretending a great Kindness for the <HI>Dutch;</HI> who since have experienced it to their no small Detriment, which however may in time be repay'd. How the <HI>Port</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Court have hitherto taken equal Mea∣sures, never observing any Obligation longer than it tended to their Interest, we leave the World to judge.</P>
<P>This was not all the design of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. for by embroiling <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> he had leisure (notwithstand∣ing the Peace solemnly sworn to, and concluded with the King of <HI>Spain</HI>) to enter <HI>Flanders,</HI> under Pretence of some Particulars not performed, relating to the Contract of Marriage with the <HI>In∣fanta.</HI> Nor could his Queen persuade him to reason, but in <HI>May</HI> 1667. he entered <HI>Flanders</HI> with an Army of 30000.
<PB N="35" REF="21"/>Horse and Foot; upon which unexpe∣cted surprize, many of the Garrisons drew off, as <HI>Armantiers, Labassee, Conde, Bergues, S. Guilhain,</HI> and <HI>Furves;</HI> of which the Mareschal <HI>d' Aumont</HI> took Possession. And the better to secure the Frontiers, <HI>Lewis</HI> commanded <HI>Charleroy</HI> to be Rebuilt and Fortified. Many o∣ther Towns of Note were taken, being rather got by surprize than by true Va∣lour on the part of the <HI>Franch:</HI> For many of them, in this security, were unprovided of many things that might have contributed to a longer Defence, or secured them from falling into the Hands of the Invader. <HI>Lille</HI> was the only Place that made a resolute Defence; for in this place was a Governour of great Repute, under whose Command was a Garrison of 4000 Foot, and 800 Horse: Nor was it gained but by a bloo∣dy Siege, when the Governour found all hopes of expecting Relief vain, through the want of timely Notice of the <HI>French</HI> King's Intentions to Invade those Pro∣vinces, or the unpreparedness of the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> to send an Army to op∣pose the Torrent of a <HI>French</HI> Power, ad∣vantageously poured into those Coun∣tries. The Town Surrendered upon
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>Articles on the 28. of <HI>August,</HI> and <HI>Lewis,</HI> who then was in the Army, entered into it. Notwithstanding, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> during the Siege made some Attempts to Relieve it, but, their Forces being small, they were frustrated.</P>
<P>In the Year 1668. for the Glory of his Arms, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. thought of ano∣ther Enterprize, which was, to take into his Possession by Force the <HI>French Comte,</HI> which, as a kind of a <HI>Palatinate,</HI> or separate <HI>Principality,</HI> had enjoyed many Privileges and Immunities; which being altogether unarmed or capable of Defence upon such a Surprize, the In∣habitants were forced to send to the King's Deputies to treat of Yielding; thereby to prevent the Spoils and Ra∣vage of a Hunger starved Army. How∣ever, in the midst of the Treaty, <HI>Be∣sanson</HI> was possessed by a forced Surren∣der on the Sixth of <HI>February. Salines</HI> was also Surprized; and many other places not being sufficiently Garrisoned, or provided with Stores, were obliged to their Gates. <HI>Dole</HI> only was capable of making a shew of Resistence; but the <HI>French</HI> Army being numerous, and sud∣denly possessing themselves of the Out∣works, they were forced to accept of
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>such Terms as were offered by the <HI>French</HI> King, and thereupon they sent him the Keys of the City.</P>
<P>It may be guessed what little Expecta∣tion this Country had of a <HI>French</HI> Army, when in the space of Twelve Days so many strong Places Yeilded, that were capable of holding out many Years, had they had timely Notice, and well pro∣vided. But it has ever been observable, that this King gains most of his Advan∣tages by this way, or the force of golden Pistols, charged into the Governours Pockets.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King perceiving that the <HI>Dutch</HI> (weary of his Alliance, who had done so little for them, and pretended so much,) were inclined to make a Peace, and join with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and thinking he had gained sufficiently, if he could keep what he had got, Overtures of Peace where thereupon proposed, and <HI>Mon∣sieur Colbert</HI> was sent to <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> to meet the Ministers of the Mediating Princes. And accordingly the Articles of Peace between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> were signed on the Sixth of <HI>May,</HI> and made Publick at <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Brussels.</HI> Yet <HI>Lew∣is</HI> was not well pleased to be frustrated in his Expectation of swallowing the
<PB N="38" REF="23"/><HI>Spanish</HI> Provinces, attributing his disap∣pointment to the <HI>Dutch;</HI> who declaring for the Interest of <HI>Spain,</HI> had obliged him to this Peace. But his Threats were retarded by another Enterprize. It so happened, that the <HI>Turks,</HI> with a nu∣rous Army, had besieged the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> situate in the Island formerly called <HI>Creet,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Venetians:</HI> So that may of the <HI>French</HI> Nobility, who had prepared their Equipages for the ensuing Compaign, and being prevented by the Peace the <HI>French</HI> King was forced to comply withal, went thither, and upon their Return gave an account of the place. Insomuch that <HI>Lewis</HI> think∣ing to have the Honour of relieving that Bulwork of <HI>Christendom,</HI> which had held out a long, doubtful, and bloody Siege, and upon the Event of which the Eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> were fixed, sent an Army of <HI>French</HI> men, under the Command of the Dukes of <HI>Beaufort</HI> and <HI>Navailles,</HI> consisting of 10000 Men; who, with∣out any detriment, entered that City, which was laid almost in Ruines with the Bombs shot in by the <HI>Infidels.</HI> Where∣upon, it was concluded in a Council of War, that it could be no longer tena∣ble without performing some extraor∣dinary
<PB N="39" REF="23"/>Exploit; and after a farther-Consult, it was agreed, That a vigo∣rous Sally should be made, in Order to the raising of the Siege.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> indeed were very forward; and, to give the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> his Due, he behaved himself like a man of good Courage and Conduct. The Sally was accordingly made, with great Re∣solution, and the <HI>Turks</HI> at first were beaten out of their Trenches: But the <HI>Christians</HI> possessing themselves of a Ma∣gazine of Three hundred Barrels and Sacks of Powder; whether by Matches laid on purpose by the Enemy, or fired by chance, it blew up and destroyed al∣most one whole Regiment, in which it was thought the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was killed, and buried by the overthrowing of the Earth; for his Body was not af∣terwards found. Which terrible thun∣dercrack so dismayed the <HI>French</HI>-men, who were the foremost in the Sally, that they retired in great confusion, think∣ing by the Earthquake it made, that all the Ground was hollow, and charged with Mines. So that the <HI>Turks</HI> Rallying, and being reinforced with great Num∣bers that came pouring from the Hills, the Belieged were driven into the City,
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>and the <HI>French</HI> never after that could be persuaded to make any other Sally, or so much as to stay for the Defence of the Place, although the Governour almost with Tears besought it. But the Duke of <HI>Novailles,</HI> who now Command∣ed in Chief, pretending Orders from his Master, took Shipping, and with those Forces he had left, returned to <HI>France;</HI> which was not for the Glory of the King's Arms. For, had they stayed, and done what became Soldiers, that famous City had undoubtedly been saved, which by this Defeat, was in a short time after delivered to the <HI>Turks,</HI> with whom <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has since had a better Cor∣respondence; as will appear in due Place and Order.</P>
<P>In the year 1669. the Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain,</HI> grieved that he had so easily par∣ted with his Countries, hoping it was not yet too late to retract, he required Aid of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> labouring to engage them against <HI>France.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Lewis</HI> sent the <HI>Mareschal de Crequi</HI> with an Army of 18000 Men in∣to his Country, who dismantled and pulled down the Walls of divers Towns, making great Ravagement, though he found little or no opposition. For on∣ly
<PB N="41" REF="24"/>the little Towns of <HI>Epinal</HI> and <HI>Chate</HI> made some shew of a Resistence. But there being no Army that could promise them Relief, they were compelled to sur∣render, and the old Duke to fly his Pa∣trimonial Country, and foregoe those vast Promises the <HI>French</HI> Court had made him. The Eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> being up∣on this unfair dealing, and greatly Re∣gretting it; to keep the Inhabitants qui∣et, he ordered they should be treated with somewhat more Mildness than is usually observed in the <HI>French</HI> Conquests, (as they term them, though for the most part got by Surprize or Treachery.) And finding the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were no way satisfied with his proceedings, (for he had infringed upon their Commerce,) he resolved to begin first; and having visited and strengthened his Towns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and upon the Frontiers, he by a subtil Negotiation (as some Histori∣ans will have it) of <HI>Henrietta,</HI> Duchess of <HI>Orleance,</HI> who had an Interview with her Royal Brothers at <HI>Dover,</HI> drew the King of <HI>England</HI> into an Expensive War against the States. But whether by the means of that Princess, who died upon her return into <HI>France,</HI> or otherwise, we determine not. However, it is cer∣tain
<PB N="42" REF="25"/>that great Naval Preparations were made before it was publickly known to what Intent.</P>
<P>The Duchess of <HI>Orleance</HI> dying sud∣denly, and not without Suspicion of e∣vil Practice; the Duke, by the persua∣sion of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. was Married to the Daughter of the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> Upon which Country no doubt (and it since has but too plainly appear∣ed) he had an Eye.</P>
<P>In the Year 1672, on the 7<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King's Declaration was put forth, prohibiting all Trade and Com∣merce with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Pro∣vinces.</HI> And, out of a Bravado, he mar∣ched in person at the Head of an Army of 150000 Men. By which surprizing Invasion, he like a Torrent carried all before him. So that many looked upon the <HI>Low Countries</HI> to be lost, if no speedy Stop was put to this Progress. But it has always been observed, that though the first Motions of the <HI>French</HI> are impe∣tuous, yet the least discouragement makes them Recoil. They had on a sudden filled with their Troops the <HI>Duchy</HI> of <HI>Cleves,</HI> the <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Collen,</HI> the <HI>Duchy</HI> of <HI>Limburg,</HI> the County of <HI>Zutphen, Ʋtreitcht,</HI> and its Territories,
<PB N="43" REF="25"/>with many other places, and got into their hands several strong Towns; and into this Combination the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Mun∣ster</HI> was drawn, who took <HI>Groll</HI> and some other places, though not very con∣siderable. They passed the <HI>Rhine</HI> like∣wise, and did considerable damages in such places as were found unprovided, Committing great Outrages. Which so puffed up <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. that being return∣ed to <HI>Paris,</HI> he was congratulated with Flatteries and Applauses from all the So∣cieties of the Kingdom. And in Imi∣tation of the Heathen Idolaters, the Queen caused a Chapel to be built at <HI>Roan,</HI> dedicated to our <HI>Lady of Victories.</HI> The King was styled <HI>the invincible Hero,</HI> though he was always so tender of him∣self, that he neither engaged in any Bat∣tel or Skirmish, or seldom came within Cannon shot of any place that resisted, doing what best suited his Valour, which has not overmuch of the <HI>Hero</HI> in it. But indeed the Progress of his Arms had a Recoil: for the <HI>Provinces</HI> being reco∣vered out of the Amaze this sudden At∣tempt put them into, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (now King of <HI>England</HI>) con∣firmed in his Patrimonial Offices, and honourable Trusts, as <HI>Stadtholder, Ad∣miral,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>and <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces;</HI> he presently took the Field with an Ar∣my of 24000 Men, recovering several places, and causing the <HI>French</HI> to retire, and performing many other Exploits worthy himself, and the Glory of his An∣cestors. But having taken a view of the <HI>French</HI> King's Affairs hitherto at Land, let us cast our Eyes a little upon the Ocean</P>
<P>The <HI>Fleets</HI> being Abroad in <HI>May</HI> 1672. on the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of that Month a sharp In∣gagement ensued, the then Duke of <HI>York</HI> commanding as Admiral. It continued a long time bloody and doubtful, du∣ring which many brave Men were lost, as the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> &amp;c. who would not leave his Ship, though all in Flames, till it was too late to succour him. His Body was found sloating, and afterward honourably buried; but we cannot learn that the <HI>French</HI> did any thing considera∣ble in this Action, or that any more than their Reer-Admiral, <HI>Monsieur de Rabi∣niere Trees les Bois,</HI> came up to a close Fight; who behaving himself like a man of Courage was slain, and afterward honourably Interred at <HI>Rochel;</HI> the rest lying off in a Line and firing at a Di∣stance, and many times greatly enda∣maging
<PB N="45" REF="26"/>the <HI>English,</HI> especially in their Rig∣ging, though they perceived only the <HI>Blue</HI> Squadron Engaged, the <HI>Red</HI> not being able to come up in time. So the <HI>French</HI> stood rather Neuters, or Lookers on, than any ways concerned in the Battel.</P>
<P>From this there grew a suspicion, that they had Orders to keep from Engaging as much as possible, that the two Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> might batter each other, that through their weakness the <HI>French</HI> King might become strong at Sea; which more visibly ap∣peared the following Year, 1673.</P>
<P>This Year the Valiant Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> Commanded the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, where the <HI>French</HI> joining him, he made One hundred and twenty Sail of stout Ships. The <HI>Dutch</HI> were Commanded by <HI>Du Ruytter</HI> and <HI>Van Trump;</HI> so that a sharp Engagement happened. But the <HI>French</HI> no sooner heard the Bullets begin to rat∣tle, and saw with what Fury and Vio∣lence the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Engaged, but almost all that Fleet stood away, pretending to gain the Weather-gage, the which, when they had very favou∣rably got, they e'en kept it for the Glo∣ry of their Master's Arms; for they ne∣ver came up again during the Fight.
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>And those few Captains, that had so much Sense of Honour, as not to follow their Admiral, (who were but very few,) had secret Intimation that they were in danger of being hanged, when they came into <HI>France,</HI> for not following their Flag, or Orders. But how they came off, has not yet occurred.</P>
<P>The Prince, though he made good the Fight, and came off with Honour and Bravery, stormed to be thus deserted. Whereupon, when the <HI>French</HI> Admiral came on board him to make his Excuse (which proved but a very lame one) the Prince is reported to look upon him with Indignation, and after reproaching him with Baseness, told the <HI>Monsieur,</HI> That had he been one of his Master, the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Subjects, he would have killed him with his own Hand.</P>
<P>And to let the World see how much the <HI>English</HI> Valour surpasses that of the <HI>French,</HI> and how much <HI>Lewis</HI> is be∣holden to it for his Greatness, I need instance but one Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> During this War the strong City of <HI>Mastreicht</HI> was besieged by an Army of about Forty Thousand, and the King came as near as he durst venture, that his Men might be the better encouraged. It was in∣vested
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>on the Sixth of <HI>June,</HI> and there was in it a Garrison of 7 or 8000 Men, one <HI>Faro,</HI> a Valiant Man, being Gover∣nour. The besieged made a stout re∣sistence, and many were killed on both Sides; insomuch that the <HI>French</HI> began to saint. At what time the Heroick Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who was at the Head of the <HI>English,</HI> in the height of Youthful Valour, despising Danger, went on to the Assault through Showers of small and great Shot; and Commanding in the Trenches, though Two or Three Mines were sprung to obstruct his Pas∣sage, he and the few that followed him, charged with such resolution, that they carried the <HI>Half-Moon,</HI> contrary to the Expectation of all Men, in less than half an Hour; though the Shot flew round him as thick as Hail, maintaining it till he had delivered it to a <HI>French</HI> Collonel, who was sent to relieve him. But no sooner was the Duke and the <HI>English</HI> re∣tired, but the <HI>French,</HI> though strongly possessed, not being able to endure the fire of the Besieged, quitted it. This vexed the Duke to see that a Regi∣ment could not keep, when put into their hands, what himself and a very few <HI>English</HI> had got. Insomuch, that he
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>prepared to regain it, which he did with such daring Resolution, that, ac∣companied only by Twelve Voluntier-Gentlemen, he threw himself over the Works and Trenches, with his Weapon in his Hand, and beat out the Defen∣dents, gaining the <HI>Half-Moon</HI> a second time, and delivered it <HI>Monsieur de la Feuvilade,</HI> whom then shame more than true Valour compelled to secure it. And indeed, it is conjectured by many, that this strong Place had put a stop to the <HI>French</HI> Arms, had not the <HI>English,</HI> who bore all the brunt of the Siege, done things to a wonder; so that at last it surrendered upon honourable Conditions on the Thirteenth of <HI>June.</HI> But the <HI>French</HI> fury, like a blazing Comet, ha∣ving by this time spent it self, and the Confederate Armies gathering like a black Tempest around them, <HI>Lewis</HI> found that this had been but a kind of a Frolick, to make him more known. For he was not capable of Garrisoning the Towns he had possessed and keep an Army in the Field, which made him spue them up as fast as he had swallowed them; withdrawing his Garrisons, and Abandoning them to their true Owners. which occasioned a Comical Portraicture
<PB N="49" REF="28"/>of <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI> Spewing and Sh—ing Towns and Castles. However, upon leaving those places, many of them were dismantled, and the Inhabitants obliged to part with almost all they had, for their Contribution or Ransom, at the discretion of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>England,</HI> by this time grown weary of a War, into which he had been unadvisedly drawn, and the which without any advantage to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> had cost a great deal of Blood and Treasure, whilst the <HI>French</HI> reaped the Profit; a Peace was concluded with the <HI>States</HI> for himself on very honourable Terms. So that the <HI>English</HI> Fleet being laid up, the <HI>French</HI> durst be little at Sea; yet at Land the War continued, where the <HI>French</HI> Gold did the greater Service, as indeed it has all along had the Luck to do. And in this State things continued, till the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> 1674.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. finding he had ingaged himself too far, and that his violent Pro∣ceedings had drawn a great many Princes upon him, (for they found it high time to Confederate against the Disturber of Christendom,) some Overtures of Peace were made, and a Treaty set on Foot
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>in the City of <HI>Cologne,</HI> where divers were assembled, in hopes of bringing it to Perfection. But upon the Emperor's seizing of the Prince of <HI>Furstemburg,</HI> (who worked the <HI>French</HI> Interest, tho' a Subject of the Empire, and ought to have done the contrary,) it greatly dis∣gusted the <HI>French</HI> King, and proved a <HI>Remora</HI> to this Treaty. So that Hosti∣lities continued, and the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> seized on <HI>Navaigne;</HI> which, after a short Siege was delivered up; and the King himself laid Siege to <HI>Dole,</HI> which made a stout resistence, and killed him a great many Men. But not being timely suc∣coured, it at last fell into their Hands.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="50-100" TYPE="pages">
<P>These proceedings made the Confe∣derate Armies draw together to oppose them; so that on the Fifteenth of <HI>June,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Caprara,</HI> gave <HI>Turin</HI> Battel; but want∣ing Foot, as having but One Regi∣ment of Foot to Seven thousand Horse, and hourly Expecting the Duke of <HI>Bournonville,</HI> who was coming towards them, the <HI>French</HI> on the other hand being Twelve thousand strong, not∣withstanding a desperate Fight, they were forced to retire over the <HI>Necker,</HI> many brave Men being killed, and di∣vers
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>taken Prisoners. The loss of the slain are held to be equal; and had not the Duke wanted Foot, the <HI>French</HI> had been utterly routed: For he Charged with such Fury and Resolution, at the Head of his Troops, as if he had been weary of his Life, and expected a <HI>Duke∣dom</HI> in another World, rather than this.</P>
<P>Whilst these things passed, the <HI>Dutch</HI> scoured the Seas with their Fleet, the <HI>French</HI> not daring to peep abroad; for now they had nothing to fear on the Ocean, having made a Peace with the <HI>English.</HI> Whereupon they braved the <HI>French</HI> in their Harbours, and made a Descent on <HI>Bell Isle,</HI> but could make no Advantage on that strong Place. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces at Land took the <HI>Grime,</HI> a very strong Place, after a hard Siege. And now <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. betook him to the <HI>French</HI> Policy, of tampering abroad: And finding by his Agents, that the In∣habitants of <HI>Messina</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> grew wea∣ry of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Government, he en∣couraged them to Rebel, and sent them Succours under the Command of the Duke <HI>de Vivone;</HI> seizing that City, and taking an Oath of Fidelity of the Inhabi∣tants. But when he had brought them to this Revolt, and kept a Garrison there a
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>very considerable Time, contrary to the Expection of all Men, and out of what Caprice none perhaps but himself knows to this Day, he suddenly recal∣led his Forces, leaving so many of the Inhabitants, as would not leave all they had to Ship themselves and fly into <HI>France,</HI> (where they could rely upon no Succour,) to the Mercy of the Inraged <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they had highly of∣fended by this Revolt. Nor had they above four Hours Notice: Yet as many as could, crowded on Board, and after∣ward lived in Exile, not daring to re∣turn.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>England</HI> having made a Peace with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋni∣ted Provinces,</HI> issued out a Proclamation on the Nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> 1675. com∣manding all his Subjects in the <HI>French</HI> Service as Soldiers, since the Treaty of Peace, to quit forthwith that Service, and return Home; and prohibiting any <HI>English</HI>-men to engage themselves in the like for the future; which proved a great Detriment to the Progress of the <HI>French</HI> Arms, as soon after appeared: For the Army as not only overthrown, but <HI>Turin,</HI> the most Experienced General of <HI>France,</HI> was slain. But, because this
<PB N="53" REF="30"/>Action was very Memorable, we shall not think it amiss to give a brief Account of it.</P>
<P>On the Eighteenth of <HI>July</HI> 1675, the <HI>Mareschal de Turin</HI> commanded out the Regiments of Horse of <HI>Campaigne</HI> and <HI>Orleance,</HI> with Nine Squadron of Horse, under the Command of the Marquess <HI>de Rone, Mareschal,</HI> to pass the River <HI>Ren∣chau,</HI> by the Means of Two Bridges he had laid over. And being informed, That the <HI>Imperialists</HI> had laid an Ambu∣scade on the other side, he went in per∣son to see if he could discover it from a certain Height, near the Bridge: When the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> having planted Two small Pieces in a Wood hard by, fired one of them without any considerable Execu∣tion; but the secoud being Charged with Iron, or Cartridge-shot, put a period to <HI>Turin</HI>'s Life; killing likewise, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, and divers others of Quality about him; though some Accounts say, he was killed with a Cannon Shot. However, thus ended that great General, who had been brought up in War, as we may proper∣ly term it, from his Infancy, and seen many Rivers of Blood; whose Death gave a great check to the <HI>French</HI> Affairs,
<PB N="54" REF="31"/>and the Army was so much discouraged, that it immediately retired in some dis∣order; when being pursued, and hotly engaged by <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> the <HI>Imperial</HI> General, between Six and Seven thou∣sand of them were slain, and several Colours, with some Cannon and Bag∣gage taken; the Count <HI>de Lorge,</HI> who Commanded after the Death of <HI>Turin,</HI> being wounded, and many Persons of Quality killed.</P>
<P>This was seconded by the Overthrow of the <HI>Mareschal de Crequi,</HI> near <HI>Treves:</HI> For the <HI>Confederates</HI> having besieged that place, which had been surprized by the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Mareschal</HI> came to Succour it; but the Besiegers drawing off, and giving him Battel, his Forces were totally defeated, with the loss of Three or Four thousand Men, and of all the Baggage and Cannon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the bro∣ken Army scattering, and getting into the adjacent Town. The <HI>Mareschal</HI> with sive or six men got into <HI>Treves,</HI> and, the Governour being killed, took upon him to defend the place; but the Besiegers having made Three Breaches so wide, that Forty Men a-breast might enter; the Officers finding the Ditches likewise filled up, and the Storm ready to be
<PB N="55" REF="31"/>made, they Capitulated without <HI>Crequi;</HI> who, to regain in some measure the Credit he had lost, suffered himself to be made a Prisoner of War. <HI>Binch</HI> was likewise taken by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and many other Advantages gained. So that <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI> began to think that he had overstood his Markets, and thought it high time to look out for Confederates. Whereupon he drew the King of <HI>Sweeden</HI> into an Alliance with him, to divert the War on that side of the King of <HI>Den∣mark</HI> and Duke of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI> But the <HI>Sweeds</HI> had but little Success in his Quar∣rel, as being worsted by Land and Sea, and having nothing but the <HI>French</HI> King's Word for Reparation. Insomuch that they were obliged to sit down by the Loss, and thereupon <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. began to tamper with the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> to clap up a Peace without the Consent of their Allies. But whilst it was on Foot, which made the King grant the larger Terms, his Forces under the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> were beaten near <HI>Mons</HI> by the <HI>English, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Germans.</HI> In which Action, his present Majesty of <HI>England</HI> signalized his Valour and Con∣duct to a wonder; and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> being a Voluntier in the Ar∣my,
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>by his Example so animated the <HI>English,</HI> that they let the <HI>French</HI> see they were capable of turning the Scale of Victory.</P>
<P>These Bad Successes making <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> fear he should be reduced to <HI>Lewis the Little,</HI> he made such Offers (which were seconded by many Promises and Crafty Insinuations) that the <HI>States</HI> did conclude a peace, and had all their Towns, except <HI>Maestreicht,</HI> delivered into their possession; which made many wonder. But those that have weighed the Matter, give these Reasons for their making a peace, when other Princes their Confederates were in Treaty; for that of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> was still on Foot:</P>
<P>First, They perceived the Ambassadors of their Allies, had been several Years in debate at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> without bring∣ing any thing to Perfection as to the Treaty with <HI>France;</HI> and they had great∣ly wasted their Treasure in the War, and found a peace was necessary to Re∣cruit.</P>
<P>Secondly, Their Trade, on which the Provinces mostly depend, was greatly obstructed; by which means the People were Impoverished.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They were Constrained to
<PB N="57" REF="32"/>take up Moneys on the publick Trust, to supply the Charge of the War; which being of long Continuance, could not but have consumed vast Treasures</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had not those Forces on foot in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> that was Expected; which might have hindered the <HI>French</HI> from taking several Towns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> of which, without any considerable Opposition, they had pos∣sessed themselves.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That all things were restored to them that had been taken away, which would have been difficult to have Recovered by other means.</P>
<P>Sixthly, By this Treaty they caused to be rendered up to <HI>Spain,</HI> part of what had been taken during the War.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That the <HI>French</HI> Ministers assured the <HI>States,</HI> that they would spee∣dily make a Peace with their Allies, and that they, <HI>the States,</HI> should be Arbi∣trators of that Peace.</P>
<P>These are given as Reasons. And indeed, considering how the Ministers of <HI>France</HI> pressed it with Eagerness, and declared the Extream Passion and De∣sire the King their Master had to be at peace; it might have been thought, that he mean'd as he said. The King
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>himself, during the Negotiation, sent them a Letter, wherein he styled them, <HI>His good Friends, Allies, and Confederates;</HI> promising wonderful things in the most obliging Flattery. But no Words or Promises can bind this <HI>Leviathan;</HI> for <HI>Lewis</HI> knew well enough what he did by making a Separate Peace; conside∣ring, if he should be brought to Strict Terms with all the Allies, he must of Necessity part with <HI>Lorrain</HI> to the Duke, its <HI>Rightful Lord,</HI> and with the <HI>Franche Compte</HI> of <HI>Bourgogne,</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> taken, contrary to faith given, since the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty. But, by not ha∣ving the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army upon his back, he sound himself able to deal with the rest, and to tire them out by delays. And indeed, by taking these Measures, he constrained the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Zel,</HI> to restore all they had taken from the <HI>Sweed,</HI> since that King stood for the <HI>French</HI> Interest.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>England,</HI> perceiv∣ing <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. delayed the Treaty to incroach upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> found his Ho∣nour touched, since he became a Medi∣ator, and was to be Guarrantee of the Peace. And thereupon sent over five or six Thousand Men, to defend the <HI>Spa∣nish
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>Netherlands,</HI> where the <HI>French,</HI> du∣ring the Treaty, and daily Expectation of Peace, were like so many <HI>Tartars,</HI> or wild <HI>Arabians,</HI> Ravaging and destroy∣ing the Country; but the Terrour of the <HI>English</HI> put a Check to their Pro∣gress.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. having obtained a Peace with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> he more and more delayed the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> as not doubting to bring the other <HI>Confederates</HI> to more Advan∣tageous Terms, than otherwise he could have been capable of doing. And that which made the <HI>French</HI> King more ur∣gent for a Separate Peace, was, that he knew well enough that it could not be Reasonably made with the <HI>Allies</HI> in Con∣junction, but that the Country of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI> would be required for that Duke, and the <HI>Franche Compte</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or what ever had been snatched from that Crown since the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Peace, which had been so openly vio∣lated by <HI>France.</HI> And therefore he con∣cluded, to divide the <HI>Allies</HI> was to make his own Terms. And indeed it so fell out, to the great prejudice of the <HI>Con∣federaters,</HI> Especially <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Em∣pire,</HI> as in due place will appear. And
<PB N="60" REF="34"/>indeed, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. by this means pre∣served most of his important Conquests at that time, whilst the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Bran∣denburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Zell,</HI> found themselves in a Necessity to Restore to <HI>Sweden</HI> all they had taken, or, by stand∣ing out, run the Hazard of a <HI>French</HI> Ar∣my Ravaging their Countries; whilst their <HI>Allies,</HI> who had already made peace, could not fairly give them any Assistence; unless, like him with whom they had made the peace, they layed no Stress upon Leagues, any longer than it tended to their purpose. But the <HI>Em∣peror,</HI> as well as <HI>Holland,</HI> having con∣cluded with <HI>France,</HI> the rest found them∣selves too weak long to contend with a <HI>Monarch</HI> of such vast Territories, and one whose Flatterers style <HI>Invincible;</HI> though, the contrary has often appea∣red. And, according to the opinion of Politicians and those Experienced in war, had that vast Army of the <HI>Confederates</HI> been unanimous, and vigourously pushed on, they might, by entering the very Heart of <HI>France,</HI> have reduced the Great∣ness of <HI>Lewis,</HI> and have made their own Terms. <HI>Sed, divide, et Impera.</HI></P>
<P>The Peace, as is already said, being concluded with <HI>Holland</HI> at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> a∣bout
<PB N="61" REF="34"/>the latter End of the Year 1678, was soon followed by his <HI>Imperial</HI> Ma∣jesty. But, before either of these were concluded, it will not be amiss to shew the plausible pretences of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. to the former, in a Letter in Answer to a Letter to the <HI>States General,</HI> presented him by their Ambassador, the <HI>Heer Vain Beverning,</HI> in these Words:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Matter to which <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. re∣fers them to, is a <HI>Memorial</HI> delivered to the aforesaid <HI>Ambassador</HI> by his Order, in these following Words:</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">THE King hath with Pleasure seen, as by a Letter from the <HI>States Ge∣neral,</HI> so by the Assurances which they have given him by the <HI>Heer Van Be∣verning,</HI> their <HI>Extraordinary Ambassador,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="35"/>that their Intentions to a general Peace, correspond with the Desires his Ma∣jesty hath always had to procure the same; and that they are ready to ac∣cept the Conditions that his Majesty hath offered them by his <HI>Ambassadors</HI> and <HI>Plenepotentiaries</HI> at <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> But, at the same time the <HI>Heer Van Bever∣ning</HI> hath made known to him the Sen∣timents of the said <HI>States General,</HI> he hath in their Names pray'd, that his Majesty would grant a Cessation of Arms for six Weeks, and hath represented to him, that they had need of that time to Communicate with their Allies, and obtain their Consent for the concluding so great a Work: The Condition in which his Majesty's Arms are at pre∣sent, and the favourable Opportunity that would be lost in deferring their Acting, would not permit him to con∣sent to this Proposal, if the desire of giving Peace to <HI>Europe</HI> did not much more prevail with him, than that of enlarging his Frontiers by new Con∣quests. It is upon this Considera∣tion, of contributing to the publick Repose, that he will agree, at the de∣sire of the said <HI>States General,</HI> to a Ces∣sation of Arms for Six Weeks; such a
<PB N="64" REF="36"/>one as was stipulated between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain, Anno</HI> 1668. But for as much as it would not be just, if the Enemies of his Majesty should let the time pass fruitlesly; and that, instead of its serving to Advance the Peace, they should make Advantage of it, to avoid the Effect of his Majesty's Arms, that he should have lost the advanta∣geous Conjuncture that is at present in his Hands: His Majesty desires of the said <HI>States General,</HI> that they do pro∣mise him, that in case during the Time of Cessation of Arms, they cannot bring their <HI>Allies</HI> to accept the Conditions he hath offered, that they will not assist them directly or indirectly against him or his <HI>Allies,</HI> during the whole Course of the War. In Exchange, his Ma∣jesty will in such Case renew to them the same Engagements, which he hath taken with them, by his Letter of the Eighteenth of the last Month, as well as what concerns these same Conditi∣ons, which he will be always ready to agree to. As for the security of the Places in the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> his Majesty hath thought fit to make known unto the <HI>States General,</HI> by this <HI>Memo∣rial</HI> which he hath appointed to be de∣livered
<PB N="65" REF="36"/>to the <HI>Heer Van Beverning,</HI> the sincerity of his Intentions for a Peace. And to give yet a greater Testimony thereof, he doth Command the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> General of his Army, to go and expect their Answer, during this Month, in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Brus∣sels,</HI> with Orders not to Attack any Place during that time.</Q></P>
<P>In this we may observe no small piece of <HI>French</HI> Policy, not so much desiring the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> (which has never been the aim of this Ambitious Prince,) as during the time of this Truce, to draw his Army farther into <HI>Flanders,</HI> which soon after proved almost the Ruine of many delicious places in that fruitful Country, when Peace was in the high∣est Prospect. And these Flatteries ser∣ved only to render those he treated with somewhat more secure, whilst he made his own Markets. And indeed by these, and such like Artifices, he gained upon the Belief and good Intention of the <HI>Con∣federates,</HI> more than by open sincerity he thought convenient to do. For <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. having earnestly sued for Peace, though under a Reserve or Mask of Dis∣guise, which was not then sufficiently
<PB N="66" REF="37"/>looked through, all the Princes and States of <HI>Christendom</HI> supposed they should remain at rest; and those Coun∣tries that were at the brink of Ruine, by being the Seats of a tedious War, be∣gan to rejoice, thinking the <HI>French</HI> King in good earnest; and that he would (af∣ter so much Waste and Desolation, by Firing, Plundering, Quartering, Ex∣actions, Contributions, Slaughters, and making the Fields white with the Bones of the Slain, whilst the Rivers were discoloured, and run red to the Sea with <HI>Christian</HI> Blood,) take pity on the languishing Estate of; <HI>Europe,</HI> there being a powerful Enemy in the <HI>East, viz.</HI> the <HI>Ottoman Emperor.</HI> But, instead of Sincerity, all proved but outside and formal. For <HI>France</HI> rather coveted time to breath a little, than to give over. And <HI>Lewis,</HI> who so often pretends to make War for the Glory of his Arms, that he might with less trouble Invade the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> secretly Negotiated with <HI>Teckely,</HI> to Invade with an Army, such as he could gather in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Territories, the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Hereditary Countries in <HI>Hungary, &amp;c.</HI> furnishing him with Money, and folliciting by his Ambassadors at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> with Gifts,
<PB N="67" REF="37"/>Presents, and promise of Diversion on the other-side, to break the Truce. And all this under the glorious Title of <HI>the most Christian King,</HI> and <HI>Eldest Son of the Church;</HI> which even barbarous Na∣tions have detested in a time of Peace. And yet, such have been the Humours of this King's Flatterers, that they have more and more blown up his Ambition, by comparing him <HI>to the Sun,</HI> as, <HI>to the Star of Stars, from whence all other Kings and Potentates receive their Lustre,</HI> with many other Attributes, as if they in∣tended to set him up for an <HI>Idol</HI> for all the World to fall down before. And of these we shall give the Reader a touch; because those Parasites strive, by glo∣rious Epithets, to make him appear white and shining, almost, if not al∣together, to a height of Blasphemy, whom all unprejudiced and unbiassed Men behold cloathed with Oppressi∣on and Cruelty, and dying his Scarlet Robes yet deeper in innocent Blood.</P>
<P>Amongst other things attributed to him, passing over what is mentioned as to the placing his Name on the <HI>Jesuits</HI> College, instead of that of <HI>Jesus,</HI> we find these that follow, which may be said to exceed what the <HI>Heathens</HI> have
<PB N="68" REF="38"/>ascribed to those they foolishly Worship∣ed for Gods, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Lowis the Great, <HI>born for the Glo∣ry of</HI> France, <HI>and Happiness of his People, in whom there lives an admirable Argu∣ment of Divine Wisdom and Fortitude, that alone is sufficient to convince Atheists,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Lewis the Great, <HI>a King indeed, since he Reigns not only over his Subjects, but his own Passions; being Invincible, and strongly and sweetly overcoming all things; who,</HI> just as a <HI>God,</HI> by one single Act of his Will, subjects all things to his su∣pream Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Lewis the Great, <HI>strong in Zeal for Justice, a powerful and most just Rewarder of all good Actions, the severe Punisher of Duels, Blasphemy, and all Iniquity, the true Imitator of God, who is so Good to re∣pay by way of Recompence what he promises by way of Mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Lewis the Great, <HI>according to God's own Heart, annointed with his own Holy Oil, whom in a particular manner God comman∣ded his Holy</HI> Angels <HI>to preserve in all his Ways, and whence the Existence of</HI> Angels <HI>is deduceable,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5. Lewis the Great, <HI>meditating only on eternal Things, and knowing that the gain∣ing
<PB N="69" REF="38"/>the World with the Loss of the Soul pro∣fiteth nothing, and therefore seeking of</HI> God <HI>the alone Happiness which</HI> God <HI>of his Good∣ness has called Man to.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Lewis the Great, <HI>Intent upon the Extirpation of publick Sin, and the Encrease of Integrity, of Manners and Virtue, and for that Effect giving most sure Laws, through the Inspiration of</HI> God, <HI>the Supream Law giver, by whom Kings Reign,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. Lewis the Great, <HI>the Prodigy of the Grace of</HI> God, <HI>and of so thankful a Mind towards him on that Account, being Careful to Exalt that Grace, has comman∣ded all the Faculties of his Kingdom to explain that Grace, conform to the Edicts of the Popes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">8. Lewis the Great, <HI>the Eldest Son of the</HI> Church, <HI>who has restored to their</HI> See <HI>the Bishops that had been banifhed by He∣reticks; the Enemy of Heresie; the Van∣quisher of the</HI> Turks, <HI>confiding only in</HI> God, <HI>and burning in Love towards him; the Ex∣ample of Faith, Love, and Charity,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="9">9. Lewis the Great, <HI>a Prince of Peace, the Scourge of War, having so far layed aside his Majesty, that he might Remember the Mercies of</HI> Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Lewis the Great, <HI>destroying all Vice, and decreeing Several punishments on
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>the Infringers of</HI> Divine <HI>and</HI> Ecclesiastical <HI>Laws. In all things he hath demonstrated himself a most obedient Son of the</HI> Church.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>To declare the kinds of Sin, though hard to some, yet not to perfect</HI> Christians, <HI>whose defender</HI> Lewis the Great, <HI>justly to be named the King of Glory, Strong and mighty in Battel,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We might recite a number more of this Kind, which we find in print, Ex∣ceeding the boasting Language of the <HI>Turks,</HI> in their denunciation of War, or magnifying their <HI>Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>They have not only put them in print, no doubt, with the Approbation of this King, who is not a little Ambitious of his own Praise, but the Duke <HI>De Fe∣villade</HI> has erected his <HI>Effigies</HI> Crowned with Rays and Stars, as the old Romans used to do their God <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and in ano∣ther place he is figured driving the Cha∣riot of the Sun, with this <HI>Motto, I shine to All.</HI> And indeed, this very much Re∣sembles him; for <HI>Europe</HI> has found him a very <HI>Phaeton,</HI> if we consider the almost numberless Towns and Villages he has caused to fall in Flames. At other times, they call him <HI>Homo Immortalis,</HI> an Im∣mortal Man, the same Character the <HI>Heathens</HI> were wont to give to those
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>they fansied to be deified; gathering the Conduct, Courage, Wisdom, &amp;c. not only of his Ancestors, but of all the Renowned Heroes that ever have been, which they will have centre in him, who indeed is but <HI>Mortalis Homo, cum Fistula in. Ano,</HI> notwithstanding all the Flattery of Medals, Prints, Landskips, Inscrip∣tions, Statues; or, as they have in one place made the Figures of <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> Kneeling at his feet, as if he gave Laws to the whole Earth. But how far he answers any of these Characters, let us lay aside for a time his Actions and Behaviour to∣wards his Neighbours, and look a lit∣tle into the Interiour parts of his Domi∣nions, and there see how he keeps his word, and uses his own Subjects, by whose Help and faithful Assistence, his Ancestors mounted, and himself as yet is fixed in the Throne of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. Grandfather to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. had, for the Many memorable and signal Services done him, granted the <HI>Protestants</HI> the free Exercise of their Reli∣gion by an <HI>Edict,</HI> and other Privileges that were granted them by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII, Father to this King. The <HI>Edict</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> was given at <HI>Nantes</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1598,
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>under the favour of which, the <HI>Protestants</HI> that had escaped the bloody Massacre in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> IX. and the Sword of War that had continued for many Years, revived, as we may term it, or multiplied in their Generations: But when they thought themselves most se∣cure, and every one sat under their Vines of plenty, this King by the Instignation of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> and his own Inclination, be∣gan to thirst after their wealth, as <HI>Ahab</HI> in another place had done after <HI>Naboth</HI>'s Vineyard. And finding whilst this <HI>Edict</HI> was in force, it could not be attempted with the least Colour of Justice, he pub∣lished a Strict Decree to disannul it, as likewise the <HI>Edict</HI> of <HI>Nismes</HI> given in <HI>Ju∣ly</HI> 1629. together with all the Concessions granted in them, as well as other De∣clarations, Edicts, and Arrests, of what nature soever; forbiding any of the <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> under great Pains, Pe∣nalties, and Forfeitures, to have any pu∣blick Worship amongst them; as know∣ing, like those who sought to destroy <HI>Daniel,</HI> he could not make them disobey him in any thing Lawful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bloody Decree</HI> being signed by the King at <HI>Fountainbleau, in October</HI> 1685, it was Registered and Published by the
<PB N="73" REF="40"/>King's <HI>Attorney General.</HI> And in order to its being put in Execution, and the Copies being examined and compared, it was sent into the several Bailiffwicks, and Courts of Justice, Sherifs-Courts, Districts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there to be Registered, and Charge given to the Deputies of the <HI>Attorney General,</HI> to take care they were put in Execution, with all Imaginary Force and Rigour, and to certisie the Court thereof at <HI>Paris</HI> in the Court of Vacation on the 22<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. when he did this, had, it seems, forgotten that he had on <HI>the Word of a King</HI> Ingaged the contrary, or he concluded, it was no dishonour for a King to break his Word whenever he pleased. Wherefore, before we be∣gin to take a view of his persecuting his best Subjects, it will be convenient to In∣sert his own Letter in Answer to a Let∣ter of the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg</HI>'s on the behalf of the <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Lewis <HI>XIV's Letter to his</HI> Electoral High∣ness <HI>of</HI> Brandenburg.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Would not have discoursed the mat∣ter you writ to me about, on the behalf of my Subjects of the <HI>Preten∣ded
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>Reformed Religion,</HI> with any other Prince, beside your self: But, to shew you the particular Esteem I have for you, I shall begin with telling you, That some Persons disaffected to my Service, have spread Seditious Pamphlets among Strangers, as if the <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Edicts</HI> that were passed in Favour of my said Sub∣jects of the <HI>pretended Reformed Religion</HI> by the Kings my Predecessors, and Con∣firmed by my self, where not kept and executed in my Dominions, which would have been contrary to my Inten∣tions: For I take Care that they be Maintained in all the Privileges which have been granted them, and be as kindly used as my other Subjects. To this I am engaged by my Royal Word, and in Acknowledgment of the Proofs they have given me of their Loyalty during the late Troubles, in which they took up Arms for my Service, and did vigorously oppose and succes∣fully Overthrow the ill Designs which a Rebellious Party against my Autho∣rity Royal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>This, one would think, was suffici∣ently binding; but, as it appears by a Clause in the <HI>Decree,</HI> bearing date long
<PB N="75" REF="41"/>since this Letter, the King never intended to be as good as his Word, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Whereas, (says the <HI>Decree,</HI>) That it hath pleased <HI>God</HI> to grant that our Sub∣jects enjoy a perfect Peace, and we our selves being no longer taken up with the Cares of protecting them against our Enemies, are now in a Condition to make good use of the said Truce, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> which we have on purpose facilitated, in order to the ap∣plying our selves entirely to the search∣ing out of means, which might succes∣fully effect, and accomplish the Design of the Kings, our said Grand-father and Father, our Intentions ever since we came to the Crown; we see at present,</Q> (notwithstanding a just ac∣knowledgment of what we owe to <HI>God</HI> on that account,) <Q REND="margQuotes">that our endeavours have attained the end we proposed to our selves, forasmuch as the greater and better part of our Subjects of the said <HI>pretended Reformed Religion,</HI> have already Embraced the <HI>Catholick;</HI> and since by means thereof the Execution of the <HI>Edict</HI> of <HI>Nantes,</HI> and all other Ordi∣nances, in favour of the said <HI>pretended Re∣formed Religion</HI> become useless, we judge that we can do nothing better towards
<PB N="76" REF="42"/>the entire effacing the memory of those Troubles, Confusions, and Mischiefs, which the Progress of that <HI>False Reli∣gion</HI> have been the cause of in our King∣dom, and which have given occasion to the said <HI>Edict,</HI> and to so many other <HI>Edicts</HI> and <HI>Declarations</HI> which went be∣fore it, or were made since, with re∣ference thereto; than by a total Re∣vocation of the said <HI>Edict</HI> of <HI>Nantes,</HI> and particular Articles and Concessions granted therein, and whatsoever hath been Enacted since, in Favour of that Religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>By this 'tis evident, That when he passed his Word to the <HI>Elector,</HI> and ap∣proved the Loyalty of his <HI>Protestant</HI> Sub∣jects, he had it in his thoughts upon his first coming to the Crown to suppress them. But this is the very <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and now let us see how gent∣ly he deals with them, and what Re∣ward they have for their Fidelity, and the Expence of their Blood and Trea∣sure to keep him in the Throne, against a powerful Faction under the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> and others, who were at the point of supplanting him; why those that were to see the <HI>bloody Decree</HI> Executed, fell to Consulting how they should raise the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
<PB N="77" REF="42"/>Malice high enough in Cruelty against People that had never injured them; whilst the <HI>Protestants,</HI> like the <HI>Jews,</HI> when <HI>Ahasuerus</HI>'s Decree went forth, mourned their hard Fate, and made their Application to the King; but <HI>Hester</HI>'s Tears could not prevail with his <HI>Most Christian Majesty,</HI> though they had power to make a <HI>Heathen</HI> relent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Intendent</HI> of the <HI>Ʋpper Guienne,</HI> who Resided at <HI>Montauban,</HI> summoned the Chief <HI>Protestants</HI> of that City to appear before him, and let them know, That it was the <HI>unalterable Pleasure</HI> of the King, to have but <HI>one Religion</HI> in his Kingdom, and that they must prepare to com∣ply with it; giving them time to assem∣ble themselves in the <HI>Town-house,</HI> where they unanimously agreed, rather to die than violate their Consciences, and by one deputed by the rest sent their Reso∣lution, when, the following Day, a Ba∣tallion of <HI>La Ferre,</HI> consisting of Sixteen Companies, entered the City, and were followed by a greater Number. The <HI>Protestants</HI> thereupon consulted each o∣ther, and resolved to submit to what should befal them, not caring for the Spoil of their Goods, so they might pre∣serve their Religion, resolving to rely
<PB N="78" REF="43"/>on Providence; and the Richer agreed to help the Poorer to the last of their Sub∣stance. But whilst they were thus con∣sulting, the <HI>Dragoons</HI> entered their Hou∣ses like the Locusts of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and having eaten up all they found, fell to destroy∣ing their Goods, suffering their Wines and other Liquors to run about the Cellers, scattering also their Corn in the Streets. And when they grew even wea∣ry of this wasteful Destruction, they car∣ried Linnen, Plate, Puter, and other things, to the Market-place, and offer∣ed it to Sail, where the <HI>Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Popish Priests</HI> bought them for trivial Prices, and encouraged the <HI>Lay-Papists</HI> to do the like. So that the <HI>Protestants,</HI> in four or five days, lost to the value of a Milli∣on; yet they might be said, even to take joyfully the spoiling of their Goods: But when this availed not to shake their Con∣stancy, these Missionaries of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. very proper Fellows to convert Souls, fell to Out-raging their Persons with Cruelties and Barbarities worse than Death. One <HI>Bervois</HI> they dragged to the Guards, and there for a whole Night the Soldiers continued in turns to kick and buffet him. Monsieur <HI>Solignack</HI>'s Hand they bound to a Spit, and forced
<PB N="79" REF="43"/>him to turn it, till, by the Excessive Fire they made, he himself was near Roasted to Death: And, to shew their farther Malice, made a Stable of his Di∣ning-room, where the Furniture was worth Ten thousand <HI>Livres,</HI> which they afterward destroyed. Another Person they dragged to <HI>Mass,</HI> and because he hung back, and cryed out, <HI>He would ne∣ver do it,</HI> they beat him to Death. But should we come to particular Persons, the Numbers would fill a Volume as large as those of the <HI>Martyrs.</HI></P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Garrison,</HI> a Venerable Man, who had done great Kindness for the <HI>Intendent,</HI> went to wait upon him in this extremity to intreat his Protection; but he, like a true <HI>Papist,</HI> who holds no Faith to be kept with <HI>Hereticks,</HI> notwith∣standing he offered him all his Goods, not only rejected his suit, but caused him, beyond what he had suffered, to be dragged through the Streets, and mise∣rably misused, as a means to deterr others from Petitioning him. This sort of con∣verting was not only used in this City, but throughout all the Dominions of the King, though in different Methods of studied Cruelty. Some they tossed from one Soldier to another, kicking, buf∣feting,
<PB N="80" REF="44"/>and beating them with Rods three or four Days and Nights together to keep them waking; and when at any time they fainted, or sunk down, then they used them in that manner on the Ground, or on Beds, and when they had rested, roused them again: Some they hung up by the Heels, and smoaked them with burning wet Straw, till they were almost dead Some again they blew up almost to bursting, by putting a pair Bellows into their Fundaments: They basted the Soles of the Feet of others with Lard, and held them to a Fire till almost Roasted. One <HI>Isaac Favin,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Negroplisse,</HI> they hung up by the Armpits a whole Night, and pinched off his Flesh with Pincers, yet could not prevail to make him abjure.</P>
<P>These Cruelties, and many more, were committed not only upon Men, but also upon Women, and even upon Children that were of any Years. The younger Infants were every where taken from their Parents by force, and thrust into Monasteries and Nunneries; Wives, Wi∣dows, and Virgins were in many Places Ravished and Deflowred. Some Chil∣dren, though of very tender Years, they kept fasting till they fainted, and then
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>brought them before their Parents, as imagining they would rather turn, than see their Children Perish. Many times the Priests would persuade some to Abjure, declaring, it should be only seemingly, to comply with the King's <HI>Decree;</HI> but when they had unadvisedly done that, in hopes of some respite, then they compelled them to torment their Friends and Relations into an Ab∣juration; the which, if they did not in three Days, or so much time as was gi∣ven them, the <HI>Booted Apostles</HI> are sent to them again, upon a scruple of their not being thorowly Converted. Sometimes they bind the Mothers, that give suck, to Posts, and lay their Infants to perish in their sight, unless they will Abjure. And when these <HI>Dragoons</HI> were weary of tormenting, and inventing new manner of Torments, tired with the patience of the Sufferers, and despairing to bring them to their Terms, the Officers Rate them, and send them back to torture them worse, saying, <HI>The King has Com∣manded it, and it must be done;</HI> bawling out, <HI>That the King intends to have but one Religion in his Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>These are the pleasant Paths by which <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. invites his <HI>Protestant</HI> Subjects
<PB N="82" REF="45"/>to enter into the Bosom of <HI>Mother-Church,</HI> exceeding those of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Empe∣rors; for they only killed, and made way for the triumphing <HI>Martyr</HI> to enter into Glory; but here they have a linger∣ing Death, and by a <HI>Series</HI> of Torments, above what humane Nature is able to bear, their Hearts are sometimes forced to give their Tongues the Lye. Some Persons they tortured with Engines, and put brass Pans or Kettles over the Heads of others, and with continual beating upon them, made the Party in a manner distracted. Those of the better Sort fled to <HI>Paris,</HI> thinking the <HI>Dragoons</HI> would not come so near the King's Pa∣lace: But alas, there they found no Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uge; for a <HI>Decree</HI> was set forth, com∣manding them to depart the City, and retire to their respective Habitations on greater Pains and Penalties. Nor did these Monsters of Converters only spightfully misuse their Persons, but likewise shewed their Malice upon the poor Cattle; as if the King had commanded them to bring the Hogs, Cows, Sheep, and Oxen over to the Church, as well as their Owners; for some of them they Hoxed, and so suffered them, for want of Legs, to go to perish in the Fields; others they killed
<PB N="83" REF="45"/>out-right, and suffered to rot on the Ground. Some again they drove into Rivers and drowned. They cut down the Timber, and burnt it; destroyed their Vineyards, and sold their Houses; drew their Fish-ponds, and threw their Fish into the Street.</P>
<P>These <HI>Missionaries</HI> exceeding the Bar∣barity of <HI>Tartars,</HI> were attended by a multitude of Rascally <HI>Friars</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> to take Confessions and Abjurations, as likewise by a <HI>Bishop,</HI> before whom they were to be Examined. And when those that through Torments, and being tired out, had Abjured, were at <HI>Mass,</HI> they had Spies set upon them; and if it appeared that they did it not sincerely, then they were thrown back into their former Mi∣sery. And although these Loyal People (as the King himself confessed them to be) would have left all they had, and forsaken the Country; yet that was for∣bid them on strict Penalties, as even Death, or perpetual Imprisonment. The <HI>Ports</HI> were strictly watch'd, and Ships on pain of Forfeiture forbidden to take them in; yet, through Providence, many es∣caped into <HI>England, Holland, Germany, &amp;c.</HI> and found Succour and Shelter. Their Ministers only found the Favour
<PB N="84" REF="46"/>to be Banished, but to leave behind them their Wives, Children, and Relations: Nay, they hardly escaped sending to the <HI>Gallies;</HI> for such are the <HI>Ʋnchristian</HI> Ways of the <HI>Most Christian King,</HI> that he will have it a Crime, in his Country, for Men to be Learned and Vertuous: So by this means a Million of Families were ruined, and many Thousands pe∣rished through Want, Torture, and in Prisons; for all the Gaols of the Pro∣vinces were filled with these distressed People. Nor did their Malice and Cru∣elty stop here; for although the Mini∣sters had Liberty to go into Banishment, under the hardest of Conditions; yet the King's Ministers on the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> frequently stopped them, under frivo∣lous pretences, till the time given them to depart was expired; and then char∣ged them with breaking the Orders, in not departing within the limited time, and that they must go to the Gallies; by which means they stripped them of all that little they had left; and well they thought it, if they so escaped, to wan∣der in strange Lands, and relie upon Pro∣vidence, which indeed did almost every where plentifully provide for them. The <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> put out a Decla∣ration
<PB N="85" REF="46"/>in Favour of them, inviting and encouraging as many as would or could Escape, to take up their Habitations in his Territories; commanding all his Subjects to Comfort, Harbour, Cherish, and Entertain them; and gave Order to his Ministers, to see it carefully observed in all his Cities, and Towns, through∣out his Dominions. The like, in effect, was observed in <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and other Places, where Briefs were granted, and large Contributions given for the Support of such poor Refugees as took shelter, and by many Difficulties escaped the <HI>Ʋnchristian</HI> Cruelties of the <HI>Most Christian King.</HI> Nor will it be im∣proper, for the better informing the <HI>Protestant</HI> Reader, to give a brief Account of what the Manner and Form of the <HI>Ab∣jurations</HI> and <HI>Subscriptions</HI> those of the <HI>Reformed Religion</HI> were to make, for the Pleasure of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in which <HI>Popery</HI> is briefly anatomized: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>IN the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Amen. I Believe and Confess with a firm Faith, all and every thing and things contain'd in the <HI>Creed,</HI> which is used by the <HI>Holy Church</HI> of <HI>Rome, viz.</HI> I Receive and Embrace
<PB N="86" REF="47"/>most Sincerely the Apostolical and Ec∣clesiastical Traditions, and other Ob∣servances of the said Church. In like manner I Receive the Scriptures, but in the same sense as <HI>Mother-Church</HI> hath and doth now understand and expound the same, for whom and to whom it only doth belong, to Judge of Inter∣pretation of the sacred Scriptures; and I will never take them or understand them otherwise than according to the Unanimous Consent of the <HI>Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>I profess, that there be truly and properly <HI>Seven Sacraments</HI> of the New Law, Instituted by our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and necessary for the Salvation of Mankind, although not Equally needful for every one, <HI>viz. Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extream Ʋnction, Orders,</HI> and <HI>Marriage;</HI> and that they do confer Grace, and that Baptism and Orders may not be reiterated without Sacrilege. I receive and Admit also the Ceremonies Appro∣ved by the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> in the Solemn Administration of the foremen∣tioned Sacraments.</P>
<P>I Receive and Embrace all and every thing and things, which have been de∣termined concerning <HI>Original Sin</HI> and
<PB N="87" REF="47"/><HI>Justification,</HI> by the <HI>Holy Council</HI> of <HI>Trent.</HI></P>
<P>I likewise profess, that in the <HI>Mass</HI> there is offered up to <HI>God</HI> a true, pro∣per and propitiatory Sacrafice for the Living and Dead, and that in the Ho∣ly Sacrament of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> there is truly realy and <HI>Substantially</HI> the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> together with the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Di∣vinity</HI> of the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> and that in it there is made a Change of the <HI>whole Substance</HI> of <HI>Bread</HI> into his <HI>Bo∣dy,</HI> and of the <HI>whole Substance</HI> of the <HI>Wine</HI> into his <HI>Blood.</HI> Which Change the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> calls <HI>Transubstanti∣ation.</HI> I confess also, that under one only of these two Elements, whole <HI>Christ,</HI> and the true Sacrament is Received.</P>
<P>I constantly believe and Affirm, that there is a <HI>Purgatory,</HI> and the Souls there detained are relieved by the suffrages of the faithful.</P>
<P>In like manner I believe, that the Saints Reigning in Glory with <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> are to be worshipped and Invo∣cated by us, and that they offer up Prayers to <HI>God</HI> for us, and that their Relicks ought to be honoured.</P>
<P>Moreover, I do most stedfastly A∣vow, that the Images of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="48"/>of the <HI>blessed Virgin,</HI> the <HI>Mother of God,</HI> and of <HI>other Saints,</HI> ought to be kept and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ained; and that due Honour and Veneration must be yeilded unto them.</P>
<P>I also do affirm, that the Power of <HI>Indulgences</HI> was left to the <HI>Church</HI> by <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and that the use thereof is very beneficial to <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>I do acknowledge, the <HI>Holy Catho∣lick Apostolick</HI> and <HI>Roman Church,</HI> to be the Mother and Mistress of all other Churches; and I profess and swear true Obedience to the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> Suc∣cessor of the blessed St. <HI>Peter,</HI> Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, I own and profess, without doubting, all other things left, defined, and declared by the <HI>Holy Ca∣nons</HI> and <HI>General Councils,</HI> especially by the most <HI>Holy Council</HI> of <HI>Trent;</HI> and withal, I do condemn, reject, and hold accursed, all things that are contrary thereto, and all those Heresies that have been condemned, Rejected, and Accursed by the <HI>Church.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This is the Goodly stuff to be Imposed on the Consciences of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> which even an Ignorant <HI>Indian,</HI> almost by the Light of Nature, might detect.
<PB N="89" REF="48"/>And for refusin, this, they were forced to undergoe all the Torments that wit∣ty Horrour could Invent. And to this those that Recanted were obliged to swear in the following Words:</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">I Promise, Vow, and Swear, and most constantly profess by <HI>God</HI>'s Assi∣stence, to keep entirely and inviolably, till death, this self-same <HI>Catholick</HI> and <HI>Apostolick Faith,</HI> out of which no Person can be saved. And this I do most truly and willingly profess; and that I will, to the utmost of my power, endeavour that it may be maintained and upheld, as far as any ways belongs to my charge. So help me <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Virgin.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And now to conclude this part of the Glorious Actions of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. who would be taken for the very Champion of <HI>Mother-Church,</HI> we shall give you a Copy of the Certificate, that the Re∣canting party is to leave with the Preist, when he makes his Abjuration:</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">I <HI>A. B.</HI> of the Parish of <HI>C.</HI> do cer∣tifie to all whom it may concern, that having acknowledged the Falsness of the <HI>Protestant</HI> or <HI>pretended Reformed Religion,</HI> and the Truth of the <HI>Catho∣lick Religion,</HI> of my own free Will,
<PB N="90" REF="49"/>without any Compulsion, have accor∣dingly made profession of the said <HI>Ca∣tholick Roman Religion,</HI> in the Church of <HI>D.</HI> in the Hands of <HI>W.

<P>By this the Reader may see how In∣nocent <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. would appear, when the Person is compelled to say he makes his <HI>Abjuration,</HI> without any manner of Force and Compulsion, voluntarily and willingly; when indeed, all People, e∣ven the Preist that takes it, knows it to be a palpable Lye. Indeed <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> XI. (and the <HI>Pope</HI> we must conclude to be no Friend to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, which is diametrically opposed to his In∣terest,) when <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. by his Am∣bassador at <HI>Rome,</HI> bore himself so much upon the Meritorious Service he had done the <HI>Church,</HI> in converting such a number of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> (as he styled them,) told the Ambassador, <HI>That if his Ma∣ster had nothing else to boast of, it would be little to his Glory; for his manner of Con∣verting</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="49"/>Hereticks, <HI>was neither pleasing to</HI> God <HI>nor</HI> Man. But, to trace this ambi∣tious Prince a little farther, let us see how little he regards Religion, when his Interest or Wilfulness calls him on to Vio∣lent and Arbitrary Motions. For e∣ven the <HI>Pope</HI> himself fared little better in his Hands, as far as lay in his power to attempt against him, though he would be styled, <HI>the Eldest, and most obedient Son of the Church:</HI> Whereby it will appear, that his Hand is against all, without di∣stinction.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> was so earnestly persecuting his <HI>Protestant</HI> Subjects, <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> XI. (of a <HI>Pope,</HI> reckoned to be the best that has been for some hundreds of Years) finding an Increase of Mur∣thers, Outrages and Villanies in the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and that those that committed them were harboured and protected; he thought the best way to prevent such disorder for the future, was to deprive them of their shelter, by taking away the <HI>Franchises</HI> of all the Ambassadors, that none might have cause to complain. And, in order thereto, he revoked those Privileges by a <HI>Bull,</HI> bearing date the 12 of <HI>May, Anno</HI>— which was migh∣tily opposed by the Marquess <HI>D' Lavar∣dine,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="50"/>Ambassador for <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. though none else opposed it, as holding the <HI>Pope</HI> a Sovereign Prince: in his own City. But he proceeded not only to shelter Murtherers and Thieves, even in the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> but to Protect them, and with armed Force stood upon his Guard to oppose the Officers that were sent to demand them, sending a Dispatch to his Master, to let him understand what had happened; who, in a Bravado, fell to big Words against his <HI>Holy Father,</HI> resolving not to part with any part of his <HI>Franchises.</HI> However he seized upon the City of <HI>Avignion,</HI> whch had been held for many Ages as part of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Peter's</HI> Patrimo∣ny, and caused the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Supremacy to be denied in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> as appears by the Speech of Monsieur <HI>de Tolon, Advocate General,</HI> who likewise plays with the great Thunderbolt of the <HI>Roman See,</HI> (which has so long been a Bugbear to all the <HI>Roman Catholick Princes,</HI>) like a Tennis-Ball, when he has this Expression; <HI>And to add,</HI> (says he,) <HI>to that</HI> Bull, (meaning that by which the <HI>Franchises</HI> were taken away,) <HI>vain Threats of Excommunication, that are not capable of creating the least Terrour in the most timerous Minds, and in the nicest
<PB N="93" REF="50"/>Consciences,</HI> &amp;c. But neither these big Words, nor his frequent Solicitations, nor his many Purses of Gold distributed amongst Favourites, could bring the <HI>Old Man</HI> to buckle <HI>to his Most Christian Son</HI>'s Humour: For the Ambassador persisting to contemn the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Orders, he Ex∣communicated him, and Interdicted the Church of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Lewis</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> for admit∣ting him in the Night-time to the <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> forbidding all manner of Per∣sons to have Converse either with them, or him. But the Circumstances of this Matter we shall see in an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Appeal,</HI> put in by the <HI>Attorney General</HI> of <HI>France</HI> to the <HI>Council,</HI> upon the Subject of the <HI>Pope's Bull</HI> concerning the <HI>Franchises,</HI> &amp;c. in these Words:</P>
<P>Before the under-written <HI>Apostolick Notory,</HI> was present in his own Person <HI>Messire Achilles de Harlay,</HI> Counsellor of the King in his <HI>Conncil of State,</HI> and his Majesty's <HI>Attorney General;</HI> who (in the Presence, and by the Advice and Coun∣sel of <HI>Messire Denis Talon,</HI> and <HI>Messire Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cois Critean de la Moignon,</HI> also Coun∣sellors of the King in his <HI>Council of State,</HI> and his <HI>Advocates General</HI> in his Courts of <HI>Parliament,</HI>) has declared,</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>That ha∣ving some time since seen Copies of a
<PB N="94" REF="51"/><HI>Bull</HI> given on the 12<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> last past, by our <HI>Holy Father, Pope Innocent</HI> XI. concerning the <HI>Franchises,</HI> which cer∣tain Persons are in Possession of in the City of <HI>Rome;</HI> he could not have ima∣gined, that <HI>His Holiness</HI> could have con∣ceived the Design of comprehending the Ambassadors the King was willing to send to him, in the general Menaces of Excommunication, which he judg∣ed convenient to insert therein, con∣trary to the use observed by other <HI>Popes</HI> in the <HI>Bulls</HI> made by them. He had hoped, that if the remembrance of the sovereign Power, which the King's Majesty's Predecessors exercised in <HI>Rome,</HI> of their Liberalities to the <HI>Holy See,</HI> and of the Protection they gave to several <HI>Popes,</HI> could not induce this <HI>Pope</HI> to cause to be rendered to the King, in the Person of his Ministers, Honours and Testimonies of Acknowledgment, proportionable to his Bounties: At least his Holiness, as visible Head of the <HI>Church,</HI> would not be insensible to the Prodigies the King had performed before his Eyes, for the Reuniting with∣in the Bosom of his <HI>Good Mother,</HI> so vast a number of Children that were gone astray from her;(<HI>by these he means the</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="51"/>Dragoon'd Converts;) but that he would be Affected with the Piety of this Prince, and the powerful Prote∣ction he continually gives to Prelates; though he insists not on his Victories and Power, and that he would not enter into Disputes with him about Rights that had not suffered any Inva∣sion under his <HI>Popedom</HI> for many Years: But being informed, that <HI>His Holiness</HI> had given Orders to the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> that is his Vicar in <HI>Rome,</HI> to declare the Church of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Lewis,</HI> in that City, and the <HI>Ecclesiasticks</HI> that officiate in it, In∣terdicted, for having admitted to the participation of the <HI>Holy Mysteries of the Sacrament,</HI> on the Night wherein is Celebrated the Solemnity of our <HI>Lord's Nativy,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Le Marquis de La∣vardin,</HI> the King's Ambassador Extra∣ordinary to His <HI>Holiness,</HI> and that it was supposed upon the Ordinance delivered upon this Subject, that he was noto∣riously Excommunicated, for preten∣ded Contraventions to the <HI>Bull;</HI> the said <HI>Attorney General</HI> did not think he could, without being wanting to his duty, remain any longer in Silence he hath hitherto kept.</P>
<P>Now, if the matter which has given
<PB N="96" REF="52"/>an occasion to so great an Excess, did concern the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Jurisdiction that belongs to the <HI>Pope,</HI> he would easi∣ly shew the Errours that have been com∣mitted by proceeding against a person that has not been particularly specified in that <HI>Bull,</HI> to whom the State of the matter has not been signified since his being at <HI>Rome,</HI> who might be ignorant of them in <HI>France</HI> where it was not pub∣lished, that the <HI>Pope</HI> could condemn him as an Ambassador, though his Cha∣racter ought to secure him from these Thunders, in regard of his Functions; yet <HI>His Holiness</HI> would not so much as hear him, or own him in that Quality, whatever Addresses he has caused to be made for that purpose; and that, in fine, the very Rules of the Ca∣non Law requires, that Persons of so eminent a Dignity should be pointed out by Name in <HI>Bulls</HI> of that Nature, before they incurr the Penalties they utter.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Pope,</HI> in a matter purely Tem∣poral, as are these <HI>Franchises,</HI> has made use of the Spriritual Arms, which he is intrusted with, only for the Conduct and Edification of the Church. (Here, by the way, the <HI>Pope</HI> might have de∣manded
<PB N="97" REF="52"/>of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. Why he used <HI>Temporal</HI> Arms in <HI>Spiritual</HI> matters, as his <HI>Dragoon-Converts</HI> can testifie. But to go on:) And having constituted himself Judge in his own Cause, the Excommu∣nication which his <HI>Holiness Cardinal Vi∣car</HI> declares to be Incurr'd, is so Null, that there is no occasion for any Pro∣ceeding to annihilate it; and those that are therein comprehended ought not to receive Absolution, though it were offered them even at their own homes. And indeed the said King's <HI>Attorney</HI> does, with all the <HI>French,</HI> ex∣pect from his Majesties Single Power, the Reparation which these Proceed∣ings challenge, and the Conservation of those <HI>Franchises</HI> which only depend on the Judgment of <HI>God,</HI> as the Rights of this Crown, which can admit of no Dominion but such as the King's Moderation and Justice may give them. But as not any thing can Contribute more to lessen, in the Minds of shallow Persons and Libertines, the Veneration which people ought to have for the Power of the <HI>Church,</HI> than the Ill use which it's Ministers may make of it; the King's said <HI>Attorney General</HI> de∣clares, that he is Appealing, as indeed
<PB N="98" REF="53"/>he appeals by the present Act, from the Abusive use that is made of it in the said <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Ordinance,</HI> not to our <HI>Holy Father Pope Innocent</HI> XI. so as has been practised by some of his Prede∣cessors: When that they had the True Ideas of their Power that their years allow them to act of themselves, there might be hopes that in time they might be brought to know the Justice and Truth of the Complaints that were brought before them: And, that nei∣ther the preventions in favour of their Country, or the Partialities of those they honour'd with their trust, did pre∣vail over the obligations which the Qua∣lity of <HI>Common Father</HI> of all <HI>Christians</HI> does Impose; Protesting to carry on this his said Appeal upon this grievance, and upon others which he reserves to repre∣sent to the <HI>first General Council</HI> that shall be held, as the Tribunal truly Sove∣reign and Infallible of the <HI>Church,</HI> to which it's Visible Head must Submit as well as it's other Members; and therein to further, amongst other things, a Regulation that shall prevent the Imploying so Holy an Authority, in uses so far from those for which it was consided in the <HI>Church</HI> in the Person of
<PB N="99" REF="53"/>S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Peter.</HI> This may make the <HI>Pope</HI> be mindful, that <HI>God</HI> having separated the two Powers of the <HI>Priesthood</HI> and of the <HI>Empire,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> cannot make use of the Authority of the <HI>First,</HI> for the Rights that depend on the <HI>Second;</HI> that is, according to Temporal Laws, he ought to possess those Large Territories which his Predecessors have received from the Liberality of Temporal Prin∣ces, and particularly from that of our King's. And, in short, he would con∣sider upon a Truth, which a Great Archbishop in <HI>France</HI> wrote to one of his Predecessors, that a Prelate who Excommunicates a <HI>Christian,</HI> contrary to the Rules, and for Rights of a King∣dom of the Earth, may in such an oc∣casion lose the Power of binding and unbinding, which his Character gives him, but he cannot deprive of Eternal Life him to whom he does this Injustice, if his Sins do not render him unworthy of the Mercy of <HI>God.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Act was signed on the 22<SUP>d</SUP> of <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> 1688.</P>
<P>We hope the Reader will pardon us the tediousness of this Matter, when by it he may perceive how little Zealous <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is for the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="54"/>when he thus violently affronts his Fa∣ther, the <HI>Pope,</HI> its Visible Head, only about a place of shelter for <HI>Thieves, Mur∣therers,</HI> and such like Villains; when at the same time he will not allow his pious Subjects of the <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> (whose Loyalty himself has owned, and whose Estates have been always ready to furnish his Wars,) to have any shelter or aboad in his large Dominions, though they have all along appeared the very sinews of his Kingdom, and held with a strong Hand, and open Purses, the Crown he wears on his Head. However the <HI>Pope</HI> would not yield to Revoke the <HI>Bull,</HI> but the <HI>Fran∣chises</HI> remained Null; the <HI>Pope</HI> publick∣ly declaring <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. the apparent Enemy of <HI>Christendom,</HI> and the only Per∣son that influenced the <HI>Turks</HI> to break the Truce, and with an Inundation of <HI>Barbarians</HI> to Invade the <HI>Empire.</HI></P>

<P>We have several times had Advice, That the Ambassador of <HI>France</HI> has been Abused in the <HI>Divan</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> being not only denied the <HI>Sofra,</HI> but beaten by the Command of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> for throwing up his Cushion that chanced to fall upon the said <HI>Vizier,</HI> as he was going out. And although him∣self has placed, and held his Stool upon
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>the <HI>Sofra,</HI> it has been removed; nay, he has had of late an Ambassador Im∣prisoned there, whose Liberty was not gained without 100 Purses of Money. And whilst all <HI>Europe</HI> was wondering what Measures this <HI>Great Monarch</HI> would take to revenge the Affront, alas! the Business was tamely clapped up, the Ambassador was recalled, and another sent in his stead, and as good Friends as ever, though the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> at the same time Reaps no extraordinary Benefit in the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominion. But those that have more narrowly pried into this Affair, give their Opinion, That these Affronts were agreed on, to cast a Mist before the Eyes of the <HI>Christian</HI> Princes, so that they might not see the underhand∣dealings that were carried on between the <HI>Most Christian</HI> and <HI>Mahomitan Turk.</HI> For this way of misusing the Ambassa∣dor, was indeed looked upon by most, as tending to a Breach, and a Rupture was daily expected.

<P>Let us look now a little back, and we shall find Count <HI>Teckely</HI> in <HI>Hungary</HI> de∣stroying with Fire and Sword, raising Troops with <HI>French</HI> Gold; and though a <HI>Protestant,</HI> secretly encouraged to In∣vade the <HI>Empire</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> Emissaries, with Promise of greater Assistance. But proving too weak of himself to oppose the Armies that were drawn that way, the <HI>Turks</HI> broke the Truce at the Instiga∣tion of <HI>France,</HI> as will more largely ap∣pear when we come to insert the <HI>Empe∣ror</HI>'s Declaration of War with <HI>France.</HI> And under that Advantage, the Impe∣rial Troops being drawn off, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. very Piously Besieged and took the City of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> a <HI>Free Imperial Town,</HI> when hardly any Body expected any Hosti∣lity. His pretence was, to restore the <HI>Bishop,</HI> which that <HI>Protestant</HI> City refused to admit with his <HI>Popish</HI> Trnmpery. The Articles of Surrender were very advan∣tageous to the Citizens; as, a promise of their Religion, Liberties, and any thing they desired. But the <HI>French</HI> gain∣ing Possession, soon barred them of a great part, delivering many over to the Mercy of the enraged <HI>Bishop,</HI> who never was any Favourer of the <HI>Protestants;</HI> and likewise restored <HI>Popery,</HI> building a
<PB N="103" REF="55"/>Cittadel, or Castle, for the better cur∣bing the Citizens; many of whom find∣ing themselves so hardly dealt with at first, and fearing worse, secretly with∣drew, with what Substance they could, to other Cities remote; whereupon the Effects they left were seized, a strict Charge was given to have an Eye upon the Inhabitants, and such as they suspe∣cted going off were Imprisoned, and all the small Towns and Villages were taken in as Dependences, and constrained to pay great Contributions; and such as could not, or refused, were threatned with Military Execution. A great Army also of the King's, lay hovering on the <HI>West</HI> Frontiers of the <HI>Empire,</HI> whilst <HI>Cara Mustapha,</HI> the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> was coming down on the <HI>East</HI> like a De∣luge, with about Two hundred thou∣sand <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> who burnt and destroyed all before them: For by this time, <HI>Mahomet</HI> IV. had proclaimed War against the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and detained the Count <HI>de Caprara,</HI> his Ambassador. All Princes of the <HI>Empire,</HI> upon the sudden <HI>Allarm,</HI> were in doubt, and suspence, which of these <HI>Turks</HI> they ought most to fear. Though <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. out of a seem∣ing pretence for the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> had
<PB N="104" REF="56"/>made an offer to assist the <HI>Emperor;</HI> but this was only shadow, as appeared af∣terwards, by his violent falling upon the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> whereby the Forces of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> were hinder∣ed from Assisting in the common Cause. And although most of the Princes of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> used their Interest with him, though all <HI>Christendom</HI> in a manner lay at stake, nothing would prevail, till he perceived the <HI>Turks</HI> could not effect what they pur∣posed. For, in the Year 1683▪ they were totally Routed, and beat off from the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> the principal City of <HI>Austria,</HI> when it was at the last <HI>Crisis,</HI> and could have held out but a few days longer.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who, on all Hands, are detested, and accoun∣ted the Incendiaries of <HI>Christendom,</HI> by the moderate <HI>Roman Cotholicks,</HI> have so great an Influence in <HI>France,</HI> since Father <HI>Maimburgh,</HI> and Father <HI>La Chese</HI> have had so great an Influence over <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. to whose fiery Spirit they labour to add Fuel, and plunge him into Cruelty with∣out Remorse, or distinguishing <HI>Prote∣stants</HI> from <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> And these were the blessed pair, that laid the Foun∣dation of the Misery of his Subjects of
<PB N="105" REF="56"/>the <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> by persuading him, That by Rooting the <HI>Protestants</HI> out of his Kingdom, he would render himself greater than his Ancestors, who were never able to accomplish that mat∣ter; and, that if he could bring it to pass, it would render his Name Im∣mortal in the <HI>Roman</HI> Kalendar. And, no doubt, as many Instances affirm, these Locusts who seek to devour every thing that is pleasant, have had as great an Influence in the Ruine of the Neighbou∣ring <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> For, from the Wideness of his Conquests, they could not but promise to themselves great Ad∣vantage, where they have so great an Influence over the Conqueror, as to have his very Conscience in their keeping and dispose. We have not of late heard that any, like Father <HI>Ante,</HI> have repro∣ved him for Exorbitancy of Lust, or o∣ther Vices, but rather encouraged him therein, that they might reap the pro∣fit at the Price of his Eternal State. And of this we may give some hints, as we find it in a Letter that has of late been frequently Printed, and held to be Au∣thentick, sent from <HI>La Chese,</HI> Confessor to the <HI>French</HI> King, to Father <HI>Edmund Petre,</HI> late <HI>Great Almoner</HI> to King <HI>James</HI> II.
<PB N="106" REF="57"/>though fatal in his Counsels to the repose of that unfortunate Prince. Wherein, amongst other matters, undertaking to give the <HI>Jesuit</HI> directions to put forward affairs, by his Counsels, Interest, and Power with King <HI>James,</HI> and others great at Court, he thus proceeds:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng" REND="margQuotes">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Reverend Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO satisfie the desire I have to show you by my Letter, the Choice you ought to make of such persons fit to stir up, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I will, in few words, since you desire it, inform you of the <HI>Genius</HI> of the people of our Court, of their inclinations, and of them we make use of, that, by a Parallel you make be∣tween them and your <HI>English,</HI> you make use of, you may know them. There∣fore I shall begin with the Chief, I mean our Great Monarch. It is certain, he is naturally Good, and loves not to doe Evil, unless desired to doe it. This being so, I may say, he never would have undertaken the Conversion of his Subjects, without the Clergy of <HI>France,</HI> and without our <HI>Society's</HI> Correspon∣dence abroad. He is a Prince Inlightned, who very well observes, what we put him upon is contrary to his Interest,
<PB N="107" REF="57"/>and that nothing is more opposite to his great Designs and his Glory, he aiming to be the Terrour of all <HI>Europe.</HI> The vast number of Malecontents he has caused in his Kingdom, forces him in time of <HI>Peace,</HI> to keep up three times more Forces than his Ancestors did in the greatest Domestick and Foreign <HI>Wars,</HI> which cannot be done without prodigious Expence.</P>
<P>The Peoples Fears also begin to les∣sen as to his aspiring to an <HI>Ʋniversal Monarchy,</HI> and they may assure them∣selves he has left those Thoughts, no∣thing being more opposite to his designs, than the method we enjoin him. His Candour, Bounty, and Toleration to the <HI>Hereticks,</HI> would undoubtedly have opened the door of the <HI>Low Countries, Palatinate,</HI> and other States of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and even of <HI>Switzerland;</HI> whereas things are at present so altered, that we see the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at present free from any fear of Danger, the <HI>Switzers</HI> and City of <HI>Geneva</HI> resolved to lose the last drop of their Blood in their de∣fence. Beside some Diversions we may expect from the <HI>Empire,</HI> In case we can∣not hinder a Peace with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, His Majesty's Brother is always
<PB N="108" REF="58"/>the same, I mean, he takes no notice of what passes at Court. It has sometimes happened, the King's Brothers have acted so, as to be noted in the State: But, this we are sure, will never do any thing to stain the Glory of his Sub∣mission and Obedience, and is willing to lend a helping hand for the Destru∣ction of the <HI>Hereticks,</HI> by the Instance he makes to his Majesty, who now has promised him to cause his Troops to enter the <HI>Palatinate</HI> the next Month. The <HI>Dauphin</HI> is passionately given up to Hunting, and little regards the Con∣version of Souls; and therefore we do not care to Consult him, how or which way the <HI>Hereticks</HI> shall be destroyed. He openly laughs at us, and slights all the Designs of which the King his Fa∣ther makes great Account.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Letter goes on to Characterize the <HI>Dauphiness</HI> in her witty Humour, and Hatred to the <HI>Protestants;</HI> as like∣wise Monsieur <HI>Lovois,</HI> the <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and others, who labour to Agran∣dize <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. by following the Me∣thods of the <HI>Society</HI> of <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who have always been held the Foxes with Fire-Brands at their Tails, who have labou∣red to promote Violence, War, and Blood∣shed
<PB N="109" REF="58"/>in all Places where they come. <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> IV. Banished them <HI>France,</HI> and de∣molished their Houses, for setting one of their Pupils to kill him in his Presence∣chamber amidst his <HI>Nobles,</HI> because he would not hearken to their Counsels, but detested their pernicious Ways. Yet, knowing them to be Sycophants, fraught with Malice and Revenge, after he had frustrated many of their Attempts, that great Prince, who had faced Death in all its Shapes, fearing their wicked Pur∣poses, thought fit to make fair Weather with them, and to recall them; which being opposed by a <HI>Lord</HI> of his <HI>Council,</HI> who alledged how pernicious they were in all Kingdoms, States and Governments, the King passionately broke out into this Expression, <HI>viz. Secure me my Life then.</HI> And indeed, this King who had remain∣ed safe in forty Battels, found his Death, as has been said, in the midst of his <HI>Ca∣pital City,</HI> amongst his Friends and Guards. Nor could the Obstinacy of the Assassinate and Paricide denote any thing else, but that he was set on by these Men. For <HI>Raviliack,</HI> the bloody Actor, neither sought to fly, nor excuse the Fact: nor, when his Flesh was pluck∣ed off with hot Pincers, would he con∣fess
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>who inspired him to doe it, but re∣mained obstinate in the midst of the most horrid Tortures, which demonstrated, that he had been decoyed by such as made him believe, the Fact was no less than Meritorious, and that Eternal Life was entailed upon him for the Deed. And no boubt, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is not fear∣less, (notwithstanding his Bravadoes) of some such Fate, if he should reject them and their Counsels; which makes him so far comply with their Maxims, as to involve the Nations in Blood, and carry Fire and Destruction where-ever his Armies come, and make himself the very <HI>Phaeton</HI> of the World. Some will object in their Excuse, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. dares not keep his Armies Idle; for, the Soldiers having been so long trained up in War by a long Ease, would grow Luxurious, and be apt, like the <HI>Roman Pretorian</HI> Soldiers, at every little di∣saster to Mutiny: or, if that he should disband them, they for the most part being Incapable of any other Imploy∣ment than the Sword, would infallibly shake his Throne, by joining with those his Tyranny has reduced in a manner to Despair. However, any Reasonable Man might think, he might employ
<PB N="111" REF="59"/>them in other matters, as fortifying his Inland-Towns, and building Piramids to his Glory, as the Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> did, to keep their People from Idleness, upon the same Score, as most Historians con∣jecture, whose Labour produced those Lasting Monuments, whose Aspiring Tops are said to penetrate the Clouds. But <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is of another Mind; he is for building a Structure with the untempered Mortar of Rapin and Vio∣lence, and Cementing it with <HI>Christian</HI> Blood; wishing, no doubt, that all who oppose his designs, had but one Neck, as <HI>Heliogabulus</HI> did by the People of <HI>Rome,</HI> that himself, as a Lasting Monument of his Glory, might have the Honour of cutting it off; which shews the very Spi∣rit of <HI>Jesuit</HI>-Counsels.</P>
<P>Pardon, Reader, this Digression, if it may be so termed in a History of this Na∣ture; for, where a Man pretends Con∣science, he is inclined to one side or o∣ther, and ought to have the Awe of Re∣ligion, of what persuasion soever he be, upon his Mind, favouring that party to which he inclines. But <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is of a contrary Temper, having his Hand against all, whilst all mens Hands are more justly against him. We will not
<PB N="112" REF="60"/>determine, what Orders he would give in relation to <HI>Turkish Mosques,</HI> or <HI>Mahomets</HI> Religion. But sure we are, in all the Progress wherever his Arms have carried Destruction, the <HI>Christian</HI> Churches of whatsoever persuasion, have felt the Marks of his Irreligion and Sacrilege. Nay, it is affirmed upon credible testi∣mony, that when the numerous Host of <HI>Infidels</HI> over-ran <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Suc∣cess was doubtful, whether the Loss or Relieving <HI>Vienna</HI> should hazard or save the <HI>Eastern</HI> part of the Empire; and Prayers were put up almost every where for the Success of the <HI>Christians, Anno</HI> 1683. the <HI>Most Christian King</HI>'s <HI>Inten∣dent</HI> at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Omers,</HI> gave a severe Repri∣mand to the <HI>Bishop,</HI> for having ordered publick Prayers to be put up, and a Fast to be held on that occasion. And when this Inundation of <HI>Barbarians</HI> were en∣tered <HI>Christendom,</HI> carrying Fire and Sword into most of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Heredi∣ditary Provinces, with Slaughter, Bon∣dage and all the Outrages that can be Imagined; insomuch that the flaming Towns and Villages seemed but one great scene of Fire, and the cries of the miserable People rent the Skies, which blushed with the Ascending Heat and Re∣flexion
<PB N="113" REF="60"/>of Blood; even then, when all good Men were overwhelmed with Sor∣row, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. brought down his huge Armies on the Front of the <HI>Empire,</HI> to o∣ver-awe the Little Princes, and keep their Troops for the Defence of their own Territories, that they might have no share in the Glory, by assisting the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> against the <HI>Infidels.</HI> And Monsieur <HI>Seppeville</HI> was a Spie upon the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Affairs, giving <HI>Lewis,</HI> his Master, from time to time, an Account of the Progress of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and of their Success; and that the League between him and <HI>Maho∣met</HI> IV. <HI>Emperor</HI> of the <HI>Turks,</HI> might be as much shadowed as it was possible, Monsieur <HI>Fouchay</HI> persuaded him to make a Diversion in the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> thereby to divert the Forces of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> from Aiding the <HI>Emperor.</HI> And here, under pretence of Dependencies, and other Matters, frivilous and ground∣less, in the Opinion of the Neighbour-Princes; he swep'd away many Towns, though even the <HI>Turks</HI> themselves, had they determined impartially, could not but have judged it not only <HI>Ʋnchristian</HI> like, but also unreasonable: Or else what could any unbiassed Man conjecture, but that the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King had
<PB N="114" REF="61"/>combined to share the <HI>Empire</HI> between them. Yet it would not have been so easie to have stopped an Inundation of <HI>Barbarians,</HI> flushed with Victory, as <HI>Lew∣is</HI> XIV. imagined. And who can tell, but if they had prevailed, they might have been by this time in the Heart of <HI>France,</HI> and shewed him play at his own Weapons. How unjustly this King took <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> and other Places in the <HI>Ne∣therlands,</HI> few are ignorant, even when it was least suspected any Hostilities would have happened. But that great City could not suffice the Ambition of this Prince; for he sent his <HI>Dragoons</HI> Abroad when <HI>Spain</HI> was altogether un∣provided, and under Pretence of Depen∣dencies, swept away whole Provinces, compelling the miserable Villages, who had been ruined by a lingering War, to part with the small Subsistence they had reserved for the Preservation of Life, un∣der pretence of Contribution; by which means many of them perished in their Houses, and in the Fields, when they had eaten all the Unclean Things they could find; and those that refused, had their Houses fired about their Ears, and their persons Tortured, to make them confess where they had hid their Trea∣sure,
<PB N="115" REF="61"/>or Goods; so that some of them died under the Tormentors Hands: By which it appears, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. shew∣ed his Zeal to the Church, in <HI>Dragooning</HI> as well the <HI>Papists</HI> as the <HI>Protestants,</HI> and even those of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which above all are accounted the most zealously Devo∣ted to the <HI>Romish Superstition;</HI> and this by way of Surprize, whilst the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the other Princes, his Con∣federates, as has been hinted, were ac∣quiring Glory at the point of their Swords. For this Monarch cares little for ingaging his Armies, it ever having been seen, that he has gained little or nothing by the fair dint of the Sword. And indeed, if we consider how easily many strong Towns have been delivered up to him by Garrisons that were able to defend them, the World cannot but conclude, false underhand Dealing has been a main Advancement to his Con∣quests; by which Methods his vast Trea∣sures have been frequently shrunk, and his Subjects Estates stretched upon the Tenters to recruit them. Upon this a <HI>French</HI> Rhimer descants, as it was found in a <HI>Billet</HI> laid on the King's Dressing Table, and Englished thus;
<PB N="116" REF="62"/>
<Q><L>Thy Grandsire <HI>Harry,</HI> the Name of <HI>Great</HI> he bore,</L>
<L>Thy Father <HI>Just,</HI> but thou'art <HI>Lewis d'Ore.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>A <HI>Lewis d' Ore</HI> is a piece of <HI>French</HI> Gold Coin, by which we may under∣stand that the Poet, such as he was, insi∣nuated, That he gained more by his Gold than by Valour or Vertue. The King was surprized at this, and dissembled the Affront; seemed to praise the Au∣thor, and promise, if he would disco∣ver himself, not only to give him a par∣don, but reward him. But, it seems, he had more wit than to trust himself in the Lyon's Paws upon such slender Secu∣rity: Yet, not to give over his Poetical Whimsey, there was soon after found in the same Place a Distich, in <HI>English</HI> thus,
<Q><L><HI>Lewis,</HI> the thing cannot be known,</L>
<L>I writ it when I was alone.</L></Q></P>
<P>Hitherto we have endeavoured to shew the World the State of Affairs relating to <HI>France,</HI> since the coming of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. to the Crown, who has in all Parts an∣swered the Prodigie of his Birth, living, as we may term it, in a perpetual Tem∣pest of War, to the Scourge of <HI>Christen∣dom.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="62"/>Few Kingdoms or Estates there are, that can boast themselves exempted from the Damage received by the Cala∣mities that have frequently happened on that Occasion. Nay, where his own Power has not reached so effectually, that of others has been imployed; not to mention his engaging the Northern Crowns of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> though <HI>Protestant</HI> Kingdom, in a tedious and expensive War, but even soliciting the Pirates of <HI>Argier</HI> and <HI>Tripoly,</HI> to Invade the Traffick of the <HI>Christians,</HI> by hin∣dring Navigation, and taking their Ships, offering them his Ports, lying advanta∣geous for the purpose, and, as it were, cajolling Nests of Thieves, and the Off∣scum of Mankind, with whom it is not for the Glory of so great a Monarch, as <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. would be thought to be, to have any Converse withall. But we see Ambition will stoop low, when it hopes to soar aloft.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. when he committed these Outrages, and disturbed the Repose of <HI>Christendom,</HI> had little regard to his Oath, and the Credit of his Ambassadors, who concluded the Peace at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> nor of the Honour of the King of <HI>En∣gland, Charles</HI> II. who was <HI>Guarrantee</HI> of
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>that Peace; nor were the States of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> less abused, who had so great a hand in bringing that memorable Treaty to pass, wherein the Ministers of all the Princes of <HI>Christendom</HI> were con∣cerned, and at which place most of them were in Person. But to give a far∣ther Light into this Matter, take the fol∣lowing Proclamation of Peace, published by the <HI>States.</HI></P>

<P>This may sufficiently demonstrate the good and honest Intentions of the <HI>States General,</HI> who could not think, but the Word of a King, and the <HI>Most Christian</HI> King, as <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> styles himself, would continue Sacred and Inviolable. But alass! his Ambition and Interest weigh down his Words and Oaths; and, in Conclusion, it appeared, that he on∣ly did it to bind up their Hands, whilst that he might the more securely prey up∣on the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI> a Country the most pleasant and fruitful in <HI>Europe,</HI> and for which many of his Predecessors have heartily longed, but never undertook the Methods he has observed to bring it under his Subjection. However, this <HI>Great Monarch</HI> has failed in his Expe∣ctation, and has frequently been baffled, when his numerous Armies have thought themselves most sure. Yet, by the way, we may Mark out a peice of <HI>French</HI> Trea∣chery, though of an Elder date; by which we may see, it is in a Manner the
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>very <HI>Genius</HI> of the Nation, though more superabundant in <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.</P>
<P>It so happened in the <HI>Year of our Lord</HI> 1551. that the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> being greatly oppressed by the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>Henry</HI> II. King of <HI>France,</HI> pre∣tending to compassionate them, sent <HI>Monmorency</HI> the <HI>Constable,</HI> with four thousand Horse and Foot, as it were to Relieve them, who demanded with ma∣ny Insinuations and Promises of Prote∣ction, a Passage through the City of <HI>Metz,</HI> a City under <HI>Protestant</HI> Government. The People in hopes to be delivered from the Ravages the <HI>Imperial</HI> Soldiers com∣mitted in their Territories, joyfully con∣sented; and, in Gratitude, spread Ta∣bles in the Streets ready furnished with Provision, for the Soldiers to eat as they Marced through; bringing Barrels of Wine, and other Liquors, to Accom∣modate them, the Magistrates waiting upon the <HI>Constable</HI> with all Imaginable demonstrations of Kindness and Respect; who seeing his time, feigned to be trou∣bled with a sudden Fit of the Gout and other Indispositions, and thereupon in∣treated the Magistrates, that he might have the opportunity of a Place of Re∣tirement for some time, and that he not
<PB N="122" REF="65"/>knowing what might befal him in the Wars, or by that Sickness, was desirous to make his Will. The Good-meaning Magistrates were highly satisfied with the Favour he would doe them, and be∣gan to contend which of them should have the Honour of entertaining him. But their Joy was soon turned into Mourning; for, when the Magistrates and most of the Gentry were assembled in his Chamber, whilst the Scrivener was making his Will, to which they were to be Witnesses, he gave private Orders for seizing the Gates. And, as soon as he knew it was done, rising up in a fury, he suddenly stabbed the Mayor of the City to the Heart with his Dagger; which being the Signal to his Guards, they fell upon the rest that were in the Chamber, and put them to the Sword. This being known, the <HI>French</HI> Soldiers over-ran the Streets, crying out, <HI>The City is won;</HI> and thereupon fell to plundering the Shops and Houses. So that this City (like the flying-Fish in the <HI>Indian</HI> Seas) whilst it thought to Escape one Mischief, fell into another, as great if not greater: For, of this kind of Fish, Sailors report, that being pursued by the <HI>Dolphins,</HI> and finding it
<PB N="123" REF="65"/>self ready to be devoured, by help of its long Fins, that serve for Wings, it shoots into the Air, and flies a great many pa∣ces, till the Fins grow stiff by dryness, and then falls into the Sea; but frequent∣ly, whilst it is flying, the Cormorants, and other Ravenous Fowl that haunt those Seas, catch them, and by them they are devoured.</P>
<P>A Second Instance of Later Date, we may mention in <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. Father to the present King, when he designed to seize upon the Dukedom of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> he, by the Advice of <HI>Cardinal Richlieu,</HI> sent for the old Duke to come to him at his Town of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who, dreading no such Treachery, left <HI>Nancy</HI> the Place of Se∣curity, and went to Complement the King who was at the head of his Troops; and after he had payed him that Homage and respect he conceived was due to him, he prepared to return, but found him∣self mistaken; for he was Arrested by the Captain of the King's Guards, upon frivolous Pretences and Claims, and made him deliver up <HI>Nancy</HI> into which he entered as a Conquerour, the surren∣der of which occasioned the Loss of the whole <HI>Duchy.</HI> Many Instances of the Like Nature, even the <HI>French</HI> Historians
<PB N="124" REF="66"/>give us, who make the Actions of their Kings appear as fair and candid as they can. But now we come to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.</P>
<P>The Peace, as we have said, being made, and all <HI>Christendom</HI> Relying on it, and firmly keeping it, except the <HI>French</HI> King; he thought this his time to play his Game, as thinking he had Charmed the Princes, or made them fear the Con∣sequence of a Rupture. He soon forgot his Word, as appears by the <HI>Emperour</HI>'s early Complaint against his Proceedings by several Letters and Memorials, That, contrary to the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. He continued his Troops in the <HI>Empire.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Remaining possessed of Places they ought to Evacuate.</P>
<P N="3">3. Requiring Contributions.</P>
<P N="4">4. Obliging the ten Towns of <HI>Alsace</HI> to take a new Oath, thereby pretending a Sovereignty over them, Erecting a new Court of Appeals, and forbiding any Ad∣dresses to be made to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Cham∣ber of <HI>Spires.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Requiring an Oath from the <HI>Vassals</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI> of <HI>Alsace.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Setting up Pretentions upon the <HI>Vassals</HI> of <HI>Metz, Toul,</HI> and <HI>Verdun,</HI> as likewise upon other <HI>Imperial</HI> States and Countries</P>
<PB N="125" REF="66"/>

<P N="11">11. The Taking <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>Bit∣seth</HI></P>
<P>And other Matters. Upon this, the <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> to whom the Complaint was made, after some Deliberation, came to a Resolution;</P>
<P>That the proceedings of the <HI>French</HI> King were directly contrary to the Trea∣ties of <HI>Westphalia</HI> and <HI>Nimeguen;</HI> that therefore the <HI>Emperor</HI> shall be prayed, by Letter or by Embassie, in the Name of himself and the <HI>Empire,</HI> to demand of the <HI>Most Christian King</HI> Reparation for the same; and that in the mean time the <HI>French</HI> Ministers residing at the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court and here, shall be made acquain∣ted with this Resolution of the <HI>Diet,</HI> and that it shall be represented to them. For what concerns the two first Points, That the same are directly contrary to the 27th of the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and the First, Second, and Fourth Articles of the Instrument, afterwards signed by the Ambassadors, for the Executing the said
<PB N="126" REF="67"/>Treaty, that have been Religiously ob∣served by the Emperor. That the Third Point is contrary to the 30<SUP>th</SUP> Article of the said Treaty, and the 8<SUP>th</SUP> Article of the said Instrument. That for what con∣cerneth the Fourth Point, it is known, that the Third Article of the Treaty of <HI>Munster</HI> says, that the Countries of the <HI>Ʋpper</HI> and <HI>Lower Alsaces,</HI> and the <HI>Lord∣ship</HI> of <HI>Haguenaw,</HI> shall be yeilded to <HI>France,</HI> with an Express Exception of the 10 <HI>Imperial</HI> Towns, and their Rights and Privileges; and that the <HI>French</HI> King shall pretend no Superiority over them, or require any Oath or Fidelity from them; and in pursuance of the Agree∣ment made at <HI>Nurenburgh,</HI> in the Year 1650. <HI>Haguenaw, Landaw,</HI> and other Pla∣ces, and other of the said ten Towns, more Actually Evacuated by the <HI>French,</HI> with∣out pretending then, and several years afterwards, to any Sovereignty over the said Towns, or requiring any Oath of Fidelity from them. That afterwards in 1665. Complaints were made to the <HI>Di∣et,</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> setting up new Preten∣sions; whereupon <HI>Arbitrators</HI> were cho∣sen on the Part of the <HI>Empire</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI> Amicably to determine the same, who were several Years employed in that
<PB N="127" REF="67"/>work, which was put to an end by the <HI>French</HI> possessing themselves of the said Towns, even before the War: That the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> Confirms that of <HI>Westphalia,</HI> and consequently that the said Towns ought to have restored to them the Rights and Privileges which that sti∣pulates for them. That for the Fifth and Sixth Points, they likwise directly con∣tervene the said Treaties. That as to the Seventh, they expect farther Infor∣mation in it. That for the Eighth, they cannot Imagine what Right the <HI>French</HI> have to Fortifie <HI>Sclechstadt,</HI> considering what is abovesaid of those <HI>Free</HI> Towns. For the Ninth and Tenth, the <HI>French</HI> have acted notoriously contrary to the <HI>Westphalian</HI> and <HI>Nimeguen</HI>-Treaties. For the Eleventh, that <HI>Hamburgh</HI> belongs to ths <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> as appears by the Treaty of <HI>Osnaburgh.</HI> That concerning <HI>Bitseth,</HI> they expect farther Information. And lastly, They hope the King will not prejudice the City of <HI>Strasburgh</HI> in its Rights or Privileges, and particularly in that of fortifying <HI>Kiel,</HI> so necessary for its Security.</P>
<P>This so Early Breach of the Peace, that had been so long laboured for by the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Christendom,</HI> much displeased
<PB N="128" REF="68"/>them, and filled many with Detestation, observing that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. went beyond the Bounds of the <HI>Decree</HI> of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Constance,</HI> which says, <HI>That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks;</HI> but he neither regards his Faith with those the <HI>Romans</HI> unchristianly term so, nor with <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> However, having a mind to secure what he had belonging to the <HI>Em∣pire,</HI> or Princes dependent, as appears by the Resolution of the <HI>Diet,</HI> in his detai∣ning some, and imposing on others, con∣trary to the Articles agreed on, he sought to bring the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> into an Offensive and Defensive Alliance, against which all the Provinces, but <HI>Groningen</HI> and <HI>Friesland</HI> Excepted, who did not so long; and their Reso∣lutions were publish'd, declaring, They intended to keep inviolably the Peace and Esteem they had for his Majesty's Friend∣ship, but could not enter into any such Alliance as he required. However, he persisted to encroach upon the <HI>Empire,</HI> suffering his Troops, that should have been withdrawn, to quarter at discre∣tion, eating up that little the Inha∣bitants had left them to subsist withal; winking at the many Complaints that were made, and proving deaf to the Cries of the People.</P>
<PB N="129" REF="68"/>
<P>This occasioned the King of <HI>England</HI> to complain by his Ambassadors; but this prevailed little or nothing, till he found a Defensive Alliance was carrying on against him; and then, under pretence of Winter Quarter, he drew off some of his Troops.</P>
<P>Let us look a little back upon the Pro∣ceeding of <HI>Lewis le Grand,</HI> in the <HI>Princi∣pality</HI> of <HI>Orange,</HI> a place of Sovereign Right for some Ages, belonging to the <HI>Illustrious House</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> and the In∣heritance of his present Majesty of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> This <HI>Principality</HI> and City of <HI>Orange,</HI> is very advantageously Situate, exceeding fruitful, and for the most part Inhabited by <HI>Protestants.</HI> These Consi∣derations made the <HI>French</HI> King Long to be Master of it; for he seldom troubles himself to War on the <HI>Alps,</HI> or in cold barren Countries. Whereupon, during the Minority of the Prince, without the least Title or just Pretence to warrant his Actions, he sent an Army to take Pos∣session of it, in the Year 1660. exerci∣sing a great deal of Cruelty and Inhu∣manities upon the Subjects, contrary to the Law of Arms, and of Nations, de∣molishing the Bastions and strong Forti∣fications; thereby purposing to himself,
<PB N="130" REF="69"/>if he should be obliged by the Princes, who looked upon him as an Intruder and an Oppressor, to relinquish it, he might with more Ease repossess himself of it, as he saw occasion. Nay, so far extended his Malice, that he not only ruined the Cittadel, but caused the Magnificent Monuments of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s Great∣ness to be laid in Ruines: And indeed, in the Year 1665. he was obliged to Re∣linquish that <HI>Principality,</HI> and the <HI>Sieur Zuilychem</HI> to take Possession of it for his Master. When in <HI>April</HI> that year, as a presage of the Prince's good Fortune, and future Greatness, a Crown of Light darting Rays, appeared over the City of <HI>Orange,</HI> hanging, as it were, in the Air, over the Palace, or place of State, ap∣pointed for his Reception, to Consolate his distressed Subjects, who for five years had groaned under the Tyranny of <HI>France.</HI> But their Tranquillity lasted no longer than the Year 1673, for then the <HI>French</HI> King supposing to make his Arms the Terrour of <HI>Europe,</HI> that so he might at pleasure become the great Arbitre of Peace and War; he, on a sudden, and very unexpectedly, entered it with his Troops. And although after by an ex∣press Article of the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="69"/>the <HI>Principality</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> was restored, and the King of <HI>England</HI> was <HI>Guarrantee</HI> of that Peace; yet the unwearied In∣croachments of the <HI>French</HI> Troops of <HI>Provence,</HI> and the Intrigues of the <HI>Po∣pish</HI> Bishop of <HI>Orange,</HI> rendered daily the Subjects of the <HI>Principality</HI> more un∣easie, till in the Year 1682. <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in a time of full Peace, as well with the <HI>States</HI> as <HI>Confederate</HI> Princes, commanded a powerful Army to take possession of it, without any manner of colour or pre∣text, but the <HI>Turkish Motto,</HI> viz.</P>
<Q><L>Sic Volo, sic Jubeo; stat pro Ratione Voluntas,</L>
<L>This I will, this I command;</L>
<L>My Will it does for Reason stand.</L></Q>
<P>And thereby his booted Missionaries or Dragoons, acted inhumane Barbari∣ties on the Inhabitants, unparallel'd in any Reign but his own. And here for an Essay of his insupportable Vanity, or ra∣ther of a Kindness unusual amongst Prin∣ces, and derogatory to Majesty it self, we must not omit; That in a <HI>Breve</HI> in Favour of the late Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> as Ad∣ministrator of the Duke of <HI>Long aville, Lewis</HI> XIV. had the foolish Confidence to treat his present Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Messire William, Count</HI> of
<PB N="132" REF="70"/><HI>Nassaw,</HI> living at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> as if thereby he had entailed upon himself the <HI>Principality</HI> of <HI>Orange,</HI> which at that time was the <HI>Supream Title</HI> of <HI>King William.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Actings of the <HI>French</HI> King in this <HI>Principality,</HI> we shall give you a brief Account, in the words of <HI>Monsieur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Chambrun, viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The dismal Cruelties (says he) acted upon my unhappy Country, and the City of <HI>Orange,</HI> so famous by the Greatness of its Princes, is at this day nought but a dismal Heap, where one cannot enter without treading upon its Ruines. She is at this day a doleful Monument of Cru∣elty and Injustice. I cannot persuade my self, that the Ruines of <HI>Troy,</HI> or <HI>Carthage</HI> were more terrible than these I have mentioned, since to one that beholds them at a distance, they appear the Habitations of <HI>Ostriches</HI> and <HI>Owls.</HI> If Posterity shall enquire the cause of this horrid Desolation, as certainly it must, the Account that shall be given of them will no doubt tend to the dishonour of <HI>France.</HI> History will not forget to hand down to succeeding Ages, the he∣roick Vertues of our <HI>Prince,</HI> when she comes to relate the Ruine of his Ter∣ritories, and Desolation of his Subjects,
<PB N="133" REF="70"/>and when they shall understand, that the Justice, the Sincerity, the Valour, and indefatigable Care of maintaining the Liberty of <HI>Europe,</HI> were the only Mo∣tives that induced the <HI>French</HI> King thus to treat an <HI>Illustrious Prince;</HI> doubtless they will say, This has been the most dismal and most corrupt of all Ages, since that which ought to have been the Ad∣miration of the <HI>Great Ones</HI> of the Earth, was the Object of their Aversion and Hatred. If this great Prince would have consented to the overturning of the Go∣vernment of his Country, as he was ear∣nestly courted so to doe; if he would have taken part with those that aim at the enslaving <HI>Europe:</HI> In a word, If he would have betrayed his Country, and broken his Faith to his Allies, he might have mounted a Throne then offered him: But because he loved his Coun∣try better than his Interest, and pre∣ferred his Honour to the richest Advan∣tages, and the Liberty of <HI>Europe</HI> to a Crown, it behoved his great Actions should be regarded with Hatred, and followed with the unjustest of Treat∣ments. But although this Conduct has been blamed in all the Courts of <HI>Europe;</HI> yet nothing has been done to oppose it.
<PB N="134" REF="71"/>And I am forced to say, 'Tis the dis∣honour of all <HI>Europe,</HI> to have suffered a great Prince to expose so often his Life with the greatest Bravery, for its Good and Liberty, and at the same time to abandon his Interest with such an unaccountable Neglect. <HI>En∣gland</HI> was obliged to protect and assist this Prince, not only as being the <HI>Guar∣rantee</HI> of the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> but from the Principle of Blood and Alli∣ance. And indeed, what Honour can Accrue to <HI>England,</HI> to see a Sovereignty wrested by unjust violence, from a Prince that had Married the Heiress of <HI>Three Kingdoms.</HI> As for me, I cannot think of the Desolation of my Country with∣out saying, amidst my Tears, with <HI>Je∣remiah, How doth the City sit solitary,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by?</HI> &amp;c. In short, is it possible (continues he) that a man that loves his God, his Re∣ligion, and his Prince, could behold with dry Eyes so many Ruines as I saw in the Principality of <HI>Orange.</HI></Q> <HI>Hic Seges</HI> est <HI>ubi</HI> Troja <HI>fuit.</HI></P>
<P>For this, see the Book of this learned Man, Printed at the <HI>Hague</HI> the last Year, Page 61, 62. Nor was it only the Buil∣dings that suffered, but the People also,
<PB N="135" REF="71"/>who for the most part, as well <HI>Papists</HI> as <HI>Protestants,</HI> were plundered of all they had, and many of them Dragooned out of their Religion, by the same barbarous Methods as were taken with his own Sub∣jects of the <HI>Reformed Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is seldom without preten∣ces to quarrel with his Neighbours; for, he has for that purpose, and to exalt himself <HI>Chief Monarch</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> set up a Chamber at <HI>Metz,</HI> called <HI>the Sovereign Court,</HI> before which he causes to be Ci∣ted Kings and Princes (well knowing they will not appear then) under pre∣tence their Lands are Dependences, or under the Claim of antient Titles or Claims, for which himself can give no Reason; he causes them to be condem∣ned as forfeited. And from this Court, where himself is both Judge and Jury, he will admit of no Appeal, but pro∣ceeds to take possession, by sending his Troops to quarter there, and Leavy great Contributions upon the Inhabitants, that, so by Impoverishing them, as he u∣ses his own Subjects, he may the better keep them under. And by this means he adjudged part of the King of <HI>Sweeden</HI>'s Terretories, and seized on the Countries of the Primes of <HI>Montbelliard, Pellite
<PB N="136" REF="72"/>Pierre,</HI> and divers others, swallowing up Provinces like the <HI>Great Leviathan,</HI> with∣out making any Account of Rights or Ju∣stice, though the time peradventure is at hand wherein he will be obliged to dis∣gorge them with Interest. His Eye has been indeed a long while up <HI>Italy,</HI> soa∣ring that way towards the <HI>Ʋniversal Mo∣narchy,</HI> which made him deal under∣hand with the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> for the strong Garrison of <HI>Cassel,</HI> which serves as an Inlet over the <HI>Alps.</HI> Nor had <HI>Ge∣neva</HI> escaped his Bombs, had not the <HI>Swisse-Cantons,</HI> fearful of their own Safety, declared with much warmth, to stand by that <HI>Protestant</HI> City with all their Forces.</P>
<P>The Peace being concluded with <HI>Spain, Lewis</HI> XIV. finding himself uneasie to be out of Action, picks a Quarrel with that Nation about 500000 Crowns he pretended were to be restored for da∣mages done in the <HI>West Indias,</HI> and there∣upon sent the Duke's <HI>D' Estree</HI> and <HI>Mor∣temer,</HI> with a Squadron of <HI>Men of War,</HI> to block up <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and to take and destroy all such Merchants-ships and Galleys as they light on. And indeed, they did considerable Mischief against that <HI>Mari∣time</HI> Town, by casting Bombs, and sen∣ding Fire-ships into the Harbour. Nor
<PB N="137" REF="72"/>thought they this sufficient, but they would have compelled the <HI>Dutch Men of War,</HI> who were at Peace with <HI>Spain,</HI> to assist them, and by that Means Involved them in an open Violation of the League. For, the latter of the Dukes having with him Eight Sail of <HI>Men of War,</HI> and happening to meet two Ships belonging to the <HI>States,</HI> Commanded by Capt. <HI>Ewycke,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Mevart,</HI> he compelled them to Sail with him towards <HI>Cadiz.</HI> However, in the Night the former stood away, and chan∣ged his Course; upon which, he was followed by the <HI>Seiur Belle Isle,</HI> who be∣ing come up with him the next morning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired several shot at him; whereupon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain returned him a Broad-side, and began a sharp Engage∣ment, which lasted four Hours; but then the Captain being killed with a Can∣non shot, as likewise a great many of the Men killed, and more <HI>French</HI> Ships ap∣pearing in sight, they sent on board the <HI>French</HI> to let them know, they would make no longer Resistence. This open Violation being highly resented by the <HI>Sates General,</HI> Monsieur <HI>D' Avaux,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador at the <HI>Hague,</HI> put in a dissembling <HI>Memorial</HI> to excuse it, in which he complained, <Q REND="margQuotes">That Captain
<PB N="138" REF="73"/><HI>Ewyeke,</HI> had given the Duke his Word to go with him to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> but changing his Course by Night, he gave ground to suspect his Intentions; and that the <HI>Sieur Belle Isle</HI> following him, and he finding himself alone with one of his most <HI>Christian</HI> Majesty's Ships, put out his Cannon, and came with all the Sail he could upon the <HI>French</HI> man, who si∣red three shot one after another, as a Signal that he should not advance any farther, to which the <HI>Hollander</HI> return∣ed a whole Broad-side of 25 peices of Cannon, whereupon the sight began: That the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain being killed, the other Officers sent on board the <HI>Sieur D' Belle Isle</HI> to let him know, that they would make good the Word of their Captain: That the <HI>Sieur</HI> received the Messenger very kindly, and after having Lamented the Loss of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, a very brave Man, sent him back, and gave them time till the E∣vening to repair their Ship (of which the <HI>French</HI> had not less need, having fourteen Men killed and six wounded.)</Q> And so he goes on to salve up the mat∣ter, by endeavouring to make the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain the Aggressor.</P>
<P>The Damage the <HI>French</HI> King did
<PB N="139" REF="73"/>the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at Sea and upon their Coast, were received but trivial by the King, and therefore contrary to Oath and Pro∣mise he caused all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Estates and Effects in the <HI>New Conquests</HI> to be seized; so that after some Debates, the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> found it self under a Ne∣cessity of complying with his perempto∣ry Demands; and thereupon the <HI>Mar∣quess de Los Balbaces,</HI> obliged himself to pay the 500000 Crowns at one entire Payment, so soon as the <HI>Spanish</HI> Plate Fleet arrived; and this Agreement was taken by the <HI>French</HI> as satisfaction, yet it proved not so; for, the <HI>Men of War</HI> being yet Abroad, took, after a long and desperate Fight, two of their Galleys, which <HI>Monsieur D' Avaux</HI> undertook likewise to excuse, by another <HI>Memorial</HI> to the <HI>State, viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">That the <HI>Sieur Forran,</HI> that had com∣manded a Squadron of his <HI>Most Christi∣an Majesty's</HI> Ships, not knowing of the Agreement and Accommodation con∣cluded by the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadors at <HI>Madrid,</HI> concerning the Five hundred thousand Crowns, had met on the Coast of <HI>Biscay</HI> two <HI>Spanish</HI> Galleyoons, moun∣ted each with Sixty four Guns, sailing towards <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and that endeavouring to
<PB N="140" REF="74"/>hinder them from going thither, ac∣cording to his first Orders, there ensu∣ed a very obstinate Fight between them, which lasted a Day and an half, when two Ships of the same <HI>Squadron</HI> coming in, and joining with the <HI>Sieur Forran,</HI> the Galleyoons yielded, and were carried into <HI>Rochell:</HI> That his <HI>Most Christian Majesty</HI> having received certain Advice thereof, had sent Orders for the dis∣charging the said Galleyoons, and had commanded him to tell the <HI>States,</HI> that this Accident should not make any alte∣ration in the Accommodation: That the Count <HI>Stirum,</HI> their Admiral, being pre∣sent at the end of the Fight; and ha∣ving answered the <HI>Sieur Forran</HI> (who sent to him to know,</Q> whether he would assist the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) <Q REND="margQuotes">that he had no Or∣ders to intermeddle with this Disse∣rence, and retiring thereupon after he had saluted the <HI>French</HI> Ships; his <HI>Most Christian Majesty</HI> had farther directed him to let the <HI>States</HI> know, how well satisfied he is with the Orders they had given the <HI>Count de Stirum,</HI> and with his prudent Conduct in pursuance of them.</Q></P>
<P>By this we may see, whilst the <HI>Dutch</HI> made a Conscience of the least Breach,
<PB N="141" REF="74"/>and had their hands tied from assisting their Allies by a Treaty, they would not break with <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. who could never find any strong enough for his Consci∣ence, when he saw it advantageous to break it. However, Heaven does not wink at such Actions, nor leave them un∣punished; for much about this time, <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> fell into a raging Tor∣ture, occasioned by an ulcerous <HI>Fistula</HI> in his Fundament, and knew in some kind, what it was to be miserable, who had made many thousands so. All the chief Chirurgions of <HI>France</HI> were con∣sulted about this matter, and concluded his Life was in danger, unless his <HI>Royal Bum</HI> was Cut and Launced. And, in fine, an Incision was made, and after that di∣vers others, which kept him long in Bed, and consequently put the thoughts quite out of his Head, of plotting a far∣ther Disturbance in the World at that time. Yet his Creatures were not Idle; for, to pick a new Quarrel, the Gover∣nour of <HI>Maeubuge</HI> set up the Arms of <HI>France</HI> in divers parts of the <HI>Spanish Ne∣therlands,</HI> under the old pretence of Boun∣daries and Limits of Dependencies; and although Complaints were made, yet little was returned in Satisfaction but a
<PB N="142" REF="75"/>few Excuses, and a Promise, that it should be considered at a more convenient time, and that Persons on either side should be appointed to adjust the Limits, And, at the fame time they proceeded to build strong Fortresses (contrary to the Trea∣ty) near <HI>Huneguen,</HI> and in the Territories of the <HI>Margrave</HI> of <HI>Baden;</HI> of which the <HI>Emperor</HI> complained by his Ambassadors, declaring how Religiously himself and all the Princes of the Empire intended to observe the Treaty. But this little availed; for the <HI>French</HI> went on with their Designs, and upon the setting out the Boundaries in the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> and on the Frontiers of the <HI>Empire,</HI> made unreasonable Exactions of Places no ways belonging to them, nor any where as∣signed in the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was obliged to acquiesce, as having Exhausted his Trea∣sures in a tedious War, and not in a con∣dition to contend alone, when the <HI>Con∣federates</HI> did not hold themselves obli∣ged to take his part, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. not content with Matters, and the Extraor∣dinary Trouble he had given his Neigh∣bours on this side the <HI>Alps,</HI> began to breath towards the Dominion of <HI>Italy.</HI> He remembred his Predecessors, by ma∣king
<PB N="143" REF="75"/>Inroads to that fruitful Country, had snatched many a pleasant Morsel, and not only satiated their Ambition, but enriched themselves till the Time of <HI>Charles</HI> V. Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as likewise <HI>Philip</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in whose Reigns the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy was at the highest it ever was known to be, when it was grasped from the <HI>French</HI> with a hard hand, and they have since had little pretensions to any place be∣yond that vast ridge of Mountains. But this King strikes in with the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> for his strong Fortress on the Frontier, for an Inlet into <HI>Italy;</HI> and, though it was opposed by all the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, the <HI>French</HI> Gold out-balanced their Sollieitations, to prevent that Duke's surre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dering a place, which would at one time or other be the occasion of swal∣lowing up his other Territories.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King having possessed him∣self of <HI>Cassel,</HI> delayed not to threaten an Invasion of <HI>Italy.</HI> This made most of the Princes combine in a strict League, and sollicite the <HI>Pope</HI> to his immediate Protection, and that he would become Head of the <HI>League.</HI> These Proceedings stop the Ambitious Monarch at that time, but hindered him not from fra∣ming
<PB N="144" REF="76"/>several pretensions. Nor did he defer to shew his angry Resentment, by picking a Quarrel with the City of <HI>Ge∣noa,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> City, and the Head of a famous Republick, situate advantage∣ously on the Sea, upon a rising Hill, there being a large <HI>Bay</HI> before it: So that he conjectured, that getting this Inlet and Harbour, he might facilitate the large Enterprizes he had cast in his mind. The occasion or Grounds of his Quarrel was about Ceremonies, and tri∣vial Matters, but where the Power is, and in a hand like that of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. it is easie to find occasion of Offence, or to suggest one. Long he stood not to digest or debate the matter, before a considerable Fleet was equipped, which put some of the neighbouring Nations into doubt to what it might tend. Dis∣courses were given out it was designed a∣gainst the Infidel Piratical Governments of <HI>Argier, Tripoly,</HI> &amp;c. though People of better Understanding considering how he had favoured and incouraged those Miscreants, to make Spoil and Robbery upon the Seas, whilst himself was doing the like at Land, and shedding Streams of <HI>Christian</HI> Blood, were of a contrary O∣pinion. Nor did the wonder last, for
<PB N="145" REF="76"/>the Fleet being ready, immediately set Sail, and stood away for the Coast of <HI>Italy;</HI> and his Threats were sent to the <HI>Doge</HI> and Senate of <HI>Genoua</HI> to comply with his demands of Satisfaction and Re∣paration which, appeared to them so un∣reasonable, that they were rejected, and the City prepared for its Defence.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Fleet of about Thirty <HI>Men of War,</HI> besides <HI>Fireships</HI> and <HI>Tenders,</HI> be∣ing come to an Anchor before the <HI>Bay,</HI> drew into a Line to block up the Har∣bour, and fired very furiously; which was answered from the Cannon of the Town, those in the few Ships that lay under the Shoar, and the Forts, and o∣ther Works that lay as Curtains and Bull∣works. But the Cannon from the <HI>French</HI> Fleet doing little other damage, than beating down some Chimneys, the Tops of Steeples, and a few of the Battlements, they drew in under the Favour of the Night several heavy Galleys, with Gab∣bions and Earth on their Decks, gaurded by <HI>Men of War</HI> and <HI>Fireships,</HI> from whence they played their Bombs, without con∣sidering the Churches and Religious Houses, that for the most part stood near the Sea, and had with them such Fatal Success, that a great part of that
<PB N="146" REF="77"/>Famous City was layed in Ruines by their beating down and blowing up. Yet the <HI>French</HI> attempting to Land, were beaten off with considerable Loss; who find∣ing the Governour of <HI>Milain</HI> was pre∣paring to come down with Forces to the Assistence of the <HI>Genoise,</HI> and that in all likelihood the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> would not stand neuter, the <HI>French</HI> Admiral admit∣ted those that were sent off to come on board him, in order to treat of Condi∣tions, but was so extravagant in his De∣mands, that nothing was concluded at that time. But the Inhabitants finding the City almost ruined by the Bombs, which played upon them continually, and despairing of any Relief by Sea, be∣gan to Murmur and Mutiny, which ha∣stened the Agreement, very dishonourable to that <HI>State,</HI> which had sometimes Lor∣ded it over the Ocean, and often defen∣ded it self against the most powerful of <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Kings.</HI> For nothing would satisfie <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> but that their <HI>Senators</HI> should come into <HI>France,</HI> and beg his Pardon, and humble themselves before his Greatness. A strange sort of Acknowledgment, when themselves had received the Injury, which four Mil∣lions could not make Good. Yet what
<PB N="147" REF="77"/>must be must be. Many other things were considered which mainly puffed up <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI> who now slattered him∣self to be the Terrour of <HI>Europe</HI> as well by Sea as Land, not imagining but this dreadful Example, and the fear of bom∣bing, would make others cautious how they incurred the Fury of such a Fire-Drake. But it seems his Terrour reached not so far as the Shoar of <HI>Africa.</HI> For even the Pirates of <HI>Argiers,</HI> whom he had so much countenanced, and to whom he had allowed his Ports as a safegaurd of Retreat, and for bringing in Prizes, and thereby a better Opportunity to rob his Neighbours; made no Scruple to break with him, and brave him, by ta∣king his Ships even in the Mouth of his own Harbours. This no doubt vexed <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI> and made him think him∣self undervalued, if he should put up such Affronts. And though perhaps he was loth to shed <HI>Infidel</HI> Blood, having so long deal'd in that of <HI>Christians,</HI> which he had poured out in Rivolets, he found the Eyes of the Neighbouring Princes were upon him, and that his Greatness would suffer an Eclipse if he dissembled it, and that he should become cheap to the World; notwithstanding his being in
<PB N="144" REF="78"/>League with the <HI>Grand Signiour,</HI> under whose protection this Government is, he set forth a Fleet to bomb it, but had not the Success as before <HI>Genoa.</HI> For, the obstinate <HI>Turks</HI> being strongly forti∣fied, made a vigorous Defence; whereby his Ships were constrained to keep off at Sea. However, having spent a great many of his Fireballs at a Distance, with∣out doing any extraordinary Damage, and not daring to land any Force; when Count <HI>D'Estrees,</HI> the Admiral, sent to demand the <HI>French</HI> Slaves, and Repa∣ration for several Ships taken, and the breaking the Truce, all the Answer that could be obtained was, to have his <HI>Consul</HI> that resided there to negotiate Affairs, halled out of Prison, and Ram∣med into a Cannon or Mortarpeice, and by its being fired, shot towards the Fleet. So that this great Preparation was fru∣strated, and the <HI>French</HI> could only boast of some few Slaves that scaped on boards, as they lay before the City, pretending they were Constrained to return, by rea∣son of the boisterousness of those Seas, through the far Advancement of the Sea∣son; when, on the contrary, it may be said, to the Honour of the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion, that a small Squadron of our Ships
<PB N="149" REF="78"/>has reduced those <HI>Barbarians</HI> frequently to such straits, that they have been ob∣liged to truckle under what Terms has been thought fit to have been imposed.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. having procured Cardinal <HI>Furstemburg,</HI> his Creature, to be <HI>Coad∣jutor</HI> to the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Collogne,</HI> and that <HI>Elector</HI> dying in <HI>June</HI> 1688, he immedi∣ately struck in to make a Party; and, to support the Interest of <HI>Furstemburg,</HI> and to procure his being chosen, as know∣ing himself should have the Advantage, and supposing to hector others out of their Pretentions, the Count <HI>D' Avaux,</HI> on the 10 of <HI>June</HI> presented the following <HI>Memorial</HI> to the <HI>States General, viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">That he was commanded to let them know, that the King his Master desi∣ring nothing more than to preserve the Peace of <HI>Christendom,</HI> his Majesty was willing to prevent whatever might trouble it. And seeing nothing is more capable of preserving the publick Tran∣quillity in the present Conjuncture, than if the Princes, Neighbours of the <HI>Ele∣ctorate</HI> of <HI>Cologne,</HI> should not leave the <HI>Chapter</HI> in an entire Liberty to proceed Canonically to the Election of a new <HI>Archbishop;</HI> That his Majesty in such case could not refuse the <HI>Canons</HI> and

<P>These were the pretences of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. to Amuse his Neighbours; but they were too Apprehensive, and knew him too well to be lulled into a Security, For indeed, he longed for this <HI>Electorate,</HI> and knew no better ways to gain it than by placing a Person in it wholly devoted to his Interest; and, to accomplish this, Parties were made, and vast Treasures expended: But, finding the <HI>Pope</HI> not a∣ny way inclined to <HI>Furstemburg,</HI> insomuch as he had not approved or confirmed his <HI>Coadjutorship,</HI> and thinking he should fail in his Expectation; he caused his Troops, contrary to what had been proposed, to march to the Frontiers, and a great ma∣ny <HI>French</HI> came privately Armed into the Cities of <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Bonne;</HI> and the <HI>Car∣dinal,</HI> not like a peaceable Church man, but like a Martial Prince, came with Ar∣med Troops at his heels, which gave Apprehensions to some, of the Danger that might befal them if they refused to give their Voice; and on the 19 of <HI>July</HI> they proceeded to Election, where after some Contest of the 24 <HI>Canons</HI> that have Voices, 13 were gained for <HI>Furstemburg,</HI> 9 gave their Voices for the Prince <HI>Cle∣ment</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Brother to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and one for the Prince of <HI>Neu∣burg:</HI>

<PB N="152" REF="81"/>This puffed up the <HI>Cardinal</HI>'s mind, as thinking certianly he had car∣ried the day, and was capable of gratify∣ing his Master to the full. But then there arose other Scruples; for, those that had voted against him made their protest, alledging that the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> as being Bishop of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> could not, without the <HI>Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Dispensation be chosen, but by Postulation, which required two Thirds of the <HI>Electors</HI> to be for him, and that it was sufficient for any other to have nine, in case the Voices were divided be∣tween two; but if they were divided a∣mongst several, it was necessary that he that was postulated should have double the number that any other had. So that Prince <HI>Clement</HI> having 9 Voices, and the <HI>Cardinal</HI> but 13, he was by virtue of his <HI>Holiness</HI>'s Dispensation duly elected. However, the <HI>Cardinal</HI> and his Party, went and Proclaimed himself in the Choire of the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> Church, and the next day the Election of Prince <HI>Cle∣ment</HI> was proclaimed. Upon this dis∣pute, the <HI>French</HI> Troops began to move nearer. The <HI>Cardinal</HI> took possession of the Palace, and both parties sent to the <HI>Pope</HI> to be confirmed and approved in the Election. However, the Election of
<PB N="153" REF="81"/><HI>Liege</HI> coming on, the <HI>Cardinal</HI> departed to <HI>Bonne,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Liege,</HI> in hopes to be elected there. But the <HI>French</HI> Gold, it seems, had not a suffi∣cient Opperation; For here he fared worfe than before, for the <HI>Baron</HI> of <HI>El∣deren,</HI> Great Dean of the <HI>Cathedral,</HI> was chosen in the 17 of <HI>August, Bishop</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Liege,</HI> having 20 Voices, and the <HI>Cardinal</HI> but 18. And after the Election had been proclaimed, he was accompanied by the Prince of <HI>Neuburg,</HI> Great Master of the <HI>Tutonick</HI> Order, to his Palace, where he received the Com∣plements of the Chief of the Country. So that the <HI>Cardinal</HI> sinding himself de∣ceived, retired to <HI>Bonne,</HI> and proceeded to strengthen himself in that Place, pri∣vately drawing in some <HI>French</HI> Troops that were advanced in order thereto. And <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. fretting to see his Pro∣jects prosper no better, prepared for Ho∣stility, ordering a new Leavy 10000 Foot and 6000 Horse to be speedily rai∣sed; giving out Commissions for that purpose, making a great many new Ge∣neral Officers as <HI>Lieutenant Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Mareschals de Camp,</HI> and <HI>Brigadiers</HI> of Horse and Foot, commanding the <HI>Gen∣darms</HI> and <HI>Light-horse</HI> to form a Camp
<PB N="154" REF="82"/>at <HI>Acheres,</HI> and the Mareschal <HI>d'Humi∣ers</HI> was sent to <HI>Flanders</HI> to form an Army of 25 Men near <HI>Mabeuge.</HI> How this a∣grees with the <HI>Memorial</HI> of his Ambassa∣dor, we make the Reader judge. Upon notice that the <HI>Pope</HI> had declared in fa∣vour of Prince <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ministers at <HI>Cologne</HI> pressed that City to a Neutrality, offering it if they would take no more Troops in. But they were too wary to trust to such Pre∣tences, when they could expect nothing more than to be suddenly invested. Whereupon they permitted the <HI>Mares∣chal</HI> to advance on the 11 of <HI>September</HI> with 2600 Foot and 100 Dragoons of the <HI>Circle</HI> of <HI>Westphalia.</HI> So that having left part of these Forces that made the Garrison 5000 strong, and viewed the <HI>Fortifications,</HI> he returned to <HI>Wesle.</HI> A∣bout this time we had Notice that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was about to set Sail for <HI>England,</HI> which made Monsieur <HI>Albeville,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador at the <HI>Hague,</HI> set forth, by a <HI>Memorial,</HI> amongst other things, how desirous his Master was to observe the Peace of <HI>Nimegnen,</HI> when at that time his Armies had entered the <HI>Palatinate</HI> under pretence of securing the Right and Pretensions of the Duchess of

They made themselves Masters likewise of <HI>Neustadt, Spires,</HI> and many other Places, and put the Countries of <HI>Wertemburg, Franconia,</HI> and <HI>Suabia</HI> under Contribution, and that the <HI>Dauphin</HI> might partake herein, he was sent to the Camp before <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> which Place was defended with much Bravery; a great number of the <HI>French,</HI> and many of note were killed in the Attacks and vi∣gorous Sallies of the besieged. Yet whilst the Siege went on, the <HI>French</HI> found an opportunity to surprize and Garrison <HI>Treeves</HI> and <HI>Mayence,</HI> and put the Counties of <HI>Hanau, Darmstadt, Solms,</HI> and the adjacent Countries under Con∣tribution.

<PB N="156" REF="83"/>march out, with Arms and Baggage, Drums beating, and Colours flying, and four Pieces of Cannon; the Garrison to be Conducted to</HI> Ulme.

Nor were the Ar∣ticles any better observed, that what has been usual with the <HI>French,</HI> or, as some will have it, by the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>This strong <HI>Hold</HI> being in their Hands, they soon possessed themselves of almost all the Towns and Villages upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> relating to the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> com∣mitting great Spoil, and many Outrages.

<P>These Proceedings obliged the <HI>Mar∣quess</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> the <HI>Emperor's Plenepotentia∣ry,</HI> and <HI>Principal Commissioner</HI> at the <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> to represent to them the State of Affairs, in the following man∣ner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<PB N="157" REF="83"/>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">That he doubts not, but that the <HI>En∣voys, Counsellors,</HI> and <HI>Deputies of the E∣lectorate</HI> Princes, and <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Em∣pire,</HI> are fully satisfied and informed, in what manner the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> besides the former Acts of Hostility, has lately, for want of Succour, taken the Fortress of <HI>Philipsburgh,</HI> and afterwards, in a Hostile manner, attack'd, and be∣sieged the remaining Places of the <HI>Pala∣tinate,</HI> to wit, <HI>Manheim, Fredricksburgh, Frankendale,</HI> as likewise the Fortress of <HI>Coblets,</HI> in the <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Tryger,</HI> as likewise made Incursions into the <HI>Cir∣cles</HI> of <HI>Suabia,</HI> and <HI>Franconia.</HI> That since the said Crown does every day carry the Fire of the War farther into the <HI>Empire,</HI> having already possessed it self of almost the four <HI>Electorates</HI> on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> by Force, and of other Lordships and Towns; so that the whole <HI>Empire</HI> is in danger to be intirely Desolate. And since that the extream Necessity, to which things are now re∣duced, plainly shews, That the Delibe∣rations of the <HI>Diet</HI> upon the Grievances complained of, and the Assistences de∣manded, are no longer to be waited for; it ought with all speed to be taken into deliberation in the <HI>Colleges</HI> of the
<PB N="158" REF="84"/><HI>Empire,</HI> to declare without any delay these Irruptions to be a War against the <HI>Empire,</HI> and to resist the Hostilities of <HI>France,</HI> with their whole and united Force; and that accordingly his <HI>Im∣perial</HI> Majesty, out of the paternal Care he has for the <HI>Empire,</HI> had commanded him to inform and assure the <HI>Diet,</HI> that he will not be wanting on his part, to contribute thereunto all that is possible for him to do.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. having thus openly Vio∣lated the <HI>Treaty,</HI> and being no longer able to dissemble the Matter, proceeded to thunder out his Denunciation of War against the <HI>States General</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces;</HI> which, for the better under∣standing of Matters, and to what he mainly pretends, we have thought fit to take notice of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in his Decla∣ration of War against the <HI>States General,</HI> published at <HI>Paris</HI> in <HI>December</HI> 1688. after he has set forth, <Q REND="margQuotes">That he has done strange things, to give Peace to <HI>Europe,</HI> he comes to the main Point, that most of all grieves him, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>States</HI> drawing their Army together, under the Command of Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> had an Influence upon hindering the Cardi∣nal of <HI>Furstemburgh</HI> (whom, he says,
<PB N="159" REF="84"/>he for many Reasons was bound to In∣fluence, and Protect) from being Inve∣sted in the <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Cologne:</HI> And for this Reason, and no other given, he declares War against them by Sea and Land, commanding his Subjects to fall upon them, forbidding Trade or Com∣merce upon pain of Death, and Re∣vokes all Pasports, and Safe Con∣duct, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>By this we may see, that he bore him∣self mightily upon the Election of that <HI>Cardinal,</HI> whom not only a great part of the <HI>Roman</HI> Clergy, but the <HI>Pope</HI> himself, looked upon as an Enemy to the <HI>Church.</HI> By which it may appear, That the <HI>French</HI> King's Pretensions to Support him, ten∣ded only to sinister Ends, and hopes by this means to annex that <HI>Electorate</HI> to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI> Upon this Declara∣tion, contrary to the Law of Nations, a Guard was set upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ambas∣sador, which obliged the <HI>States General</HI> to do the like upon Monsieur <HI>d' Avaux;</HI> by which means an Exchange was made, and either of them permitted to return. And now, though in the depth of Win∣ter, the <HI>French</HI> were abroad, ravaging the Country; and although this King had not declared against <HI>Spain,</HI> yet a
<PB N="160" REF="85"/>great Impost was laid on Goods, to be brought out of the <HI>Spanish Netherlnads.</HI> But perceiving the <HI>Confederate</HI> Armies draw∣ing together in great Bodies, he caused several of the Towns he had possessed himself of in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> to be sligh∣ted, and many Dismantled, or Demo∣lished; the Souldiers requiring great Summs of the Inhabitants, to save them from plundering. Yet many, after they had paid what was demanded, had their Goods taken away, and their Persons miserably misused.</P>
<P>To retaliate in some Measure these Proceedings, the Governour of the <HI>Spa∣nish Netherlands</HI> laid an Impost upon Wines, and Brandy; of which, when the <HI>Mareschal</HI> complained, his Excellen∣cy told him, <HI>He could not but wonder, that his Master having done the like on the Goods of that Country, he should find any Reason to complain.</HI> The <HI>Emperor</HI> more∣over commanded the <HI>French</HI> Envoy to leave <HI>Vienna,</HI> and the <HI>Plenepotentiary</HI> of <HI>Ratisbone.</HI> Prince <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Bavaria</HI> re∣fused to see the <HI>French</HI> Minister sent to Complement him, because he denied to give him the Style of <HI>Elector;</HI> and those <HI>Canons</HI> of the <HI>Electorate</HI> were comman∣ded to leave him, and return to their
<PB N="161" REF="85"/>Dignities, on pain of being Disposses∣sed, and of incurring Excommunicati∣on. Whereupon the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> in a Pet, made a new Protestation against the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Proceedings, touching the <HI>Electo∣rate</HI> of <HI>Cologne.</HI> Whilst these things were doing, the <HI>French</HI> Troops quitted <HI>Heyl∣bourn,</HI> after having Plundered it, blown up the Gates, and part of the Walls, carrying with them four Hostages, for the payment of Fifty thousand Crowns laid as a Tax. They likewise flighted <HI>Offemburgh,</HI> demolished <HI>Manheim,</HI> and burnt <HI>Oberadt,</HI> with the Villages belong∣ing to that City, declaring they would burn and destroy all the Places of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Mentz,</HI> ex∣cept <HI>Philipsburgh.</HI> And indeed, the whole Country at a distance seemed in the Night time for some space, but one Fire, the Villages and Towns every where flaming; which shew how little <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. notwithstanding his specious Pre∣tences, regards the Peace and Tranquil∣lity of <HI>Europe,</HI> this way of burning being altogether a <HI>Turkish</HI> Fashion, which is not for his Glory to imitate.</P>
<P>These Proceedings made the <HI>Swisses,</HI> that were in the <HI>French</HI> Service in the <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Cologne,</HI> quit it, declaring,
<PB N="162" REF="86"/><HI>They could not fight against the</HI> Empire; and thereupon the <HI>Cardinal</HI> sent to the <HI>French</HI> Court for more Assistence to se∣cure <HI>Bonne,</HI> the Cittadel of <HI>Liege</HI> was commanded to be blown up, and accor∣dingly performed, except one Bastion, and its Works; and although the Castle of <HI>Montjoy</HI> Surrendered upon good Ar∣ticles, the Soldiers, contrary to Faith given, were made Prisoners of War; and slighting <HI>Huy,</HI> they blew up the Walls, and either destroyed, or much defaced all the Places in the <HI>Diocese,</HI> except <HI>Chinay,</HI> which they Garrisoned.</P>
<P>On the 12th. of <HI>February,</HI> 1688. the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Empire</HI> assembled at <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> having taken into their Consideration the Mischief the <HI>French</HI> had done, contra∣ry to the Truce of Twenty Years, con∣cluded at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> proceeded to give their Resolutions, to stand by the <HI>Empe∣ror,</HI> and assist him with all their Forces, for the suppressing the Disturber of <HI>Chri∣stendom;</HI> setting forth at large, their Resentments of his Proceedings. Upon this, and the like Resolution, the <HI>French</HI> bethought themselves of slighting <HI>Hey∣delburgh,</HI> and <HI>Frankendale,</HI> and Fortified <HI>Mentz, Bonne,</HI> and such other Places as they conceived tenable. And now the

<P>The <HI>Confederates</HI> being early Abroad this <HI>Spring,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> had not so good Success as the former. For the <HI>Bran∣denburgh</HI> Forces defeated a great Party of the Garrison of <HI>Nuis,</HI> as likewise gave another Defeat to the <HI>Chevalier de Sourdis,</HI> who came with a strong Party to the Re∣lief
<PB N="165" REF="87"/>of the other, killing a great number in the Fight and pursuit, gaining a good Booty. Upon these Defeats, the Ca∣stles of <HI>Lintz, Nuis, Zons, &amp;c.</HI> surren∣dered, and the <HI>French</HI> set Fire to, and blew up many places they despaired to keep; which so astonished the Cardinal of <HI>Furstemburgh,</HI> that he attempted to leave <HI>Bonne,</HI> sending, in order thereto, his best Moveables to <HI>Mentz.</HI> Nor was <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> free from Apprehensions of his own Subjects Revolting, which made him draw his Guards near his Per∣son, and publish an Ordinance for the hindering the meeting of the <HI>New Con∣verts</HI> in several Provinces of his Kingdom, and for the putting in Execution the <HI>E∣dict</HI> of <HI>October</HI> 1685. and to raise the Ban and Arrear Ban of the Isle of <HI>France;</HI> many small Skirmishes happened on the <HI>Frontiers</HI> during the beginning of the Campagne; the <HI>French</HI> attempting to Surprize and Burn <HI>Bopert,</HI> were beaten off, and many of them killed; and soon after some of the Troops of the <HI>Land-grave</HI> of <HI>Hesse,</HI> Surprized the Garrison of <HI>Lintz,</HI> and cut them off. And notwith∣standing <HI>Liege</HI> had purchased a Neutra∣trality, at the cost of One hundred and thirty thousand Crowns, and the suffer∣ing

<P>The <HI>Palatinate</HI> by this time growing somewhat too hot for the <HI>French</HI> Com∣plexion, they resolved to doe what Mis∣chief they could before they should be obliged to abandon it; and, amongst o∣thers, upon quitting <HI>Fredericksburg,</HI> they set it on fire, and ruined the Fortifications of <HI>Cassel.</HI> But now the City of <HI>Liege</HI> finding the Misfortune of it's Neutrality, and being pressed by the <HI>Emperor</HI> to de∣clare either for the <HI>Confederates</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> (for he would allow no Neutrality,) it declared for the former, and secured the <HI>French</HI>-Resident, with divers Officers and their Arms, as Hostages for the safety of their Minister in <HI>France.</HI> The <HI>Count de Rabenac,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, was likewise dismissed the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI>

<P>On the 19 of <HI>April.</HI> 1689 <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. caused a Declaration of War to be pub∣lished in the City of <HI>Paris</HI> against the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and sent orders to break down all the Bridges on the River <HI>Sambre</HI> from <HI>Chastelet</HI> to <HI>Maubuge</HI> and so to <HI>Lan∣drecy;</HI> the Garrison of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> com∣manding all the Country that depends on them, to bring in their Provisions that exceed a Store for three Months, on great Penalties, flattering them, that after the Expiration of that time they should be other ways supplied. But, for a brief Account of the Actions of <HI>Lew∣is</HI> XIV. in his late proceedings, the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> gives us these passages, amongst o∣thers, in his Letter to the King of <HI>Po∣land, viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes"><HI>Your Serenity</HI> will have sufficiently un∣derstood by our former Letter how unjustly and treacherously the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> violating the Treaties of <HI>West∣phaila</HI> and <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and the 20 years Truce concluded a few Years since, hath invaded us and the <HI>Empire</HI> at a time
<PB N="168" REF="89"/>when we expected nothing less. But the Inormity of this Invasion is infinitely Agravated, by the horrid Cruelties and Barbarities they continue to excercise in the Places they have possessed them∣selves of, pillaging whole Towns and Countries, which, to preserve them∣selves, surrendered upon Articles, and afterwards payed the Contributions imposed upon them, contrary to the Faith given them and confirmed by the King himself or the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and after∣wards destroying them with Fire, or Levelling the Walls and Houses to the ground, and carrying away the Inhabi∣tants bound as Slaves, in a manner on∣ly practised amongst <HI>Barbarians;</HI> and forcing them with Threats of Death to follow the <HI>French</HI> Army unto other parts, not sparing the stately Houses and Palaces of Princes, which had been preserved for Ages in the bloodiest Wars; and not with-holding their Im∣pious hands even from the Churches, and excercising many other Cruelties and Inhumanities, such as are seldom Committed by the <HI>Turks</HI> themselves, and which can be hardly found in any History to be practised amongst <HI>Chri∣stians;</HI> Which as they most deservedly
<PB N="169" REF="89"/>Excite the Hatred of all <HI>Christendom</HI> against <HI>France,</HI> so they especially lay a necessity upon us, of providing for the Safety of the <HI>Roman Em∣pire,</HI> and of using all means to free it from un∣heard of Violences, and Oppressions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus we have the Word of an <HI>Emperor,</HI> to confirm what we have set forth; nor did his <HI>Ele∣ctoral Highness</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> find himself less aggrieved, and in <HI>April</HI> 1689. caused his <HI>Decla∣ration</HI> of War to be published against <HI>France,</HI> in which, amongst other things, he sets forth, <Q REND="margQuotes">That desiring nothing more, than that the publick Tranquillity of <HI>Christendom</HI> might be preserved, and that his own Subjects might, under his Government, enjoy the Benefit of Peace; but that the <HI>French</HI> King having, against all Right and Justice, not only attacked the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> but having likewise possessed himself of whole <HI>Circles</HI> and <HI>Provinces,</HI> and de∣stroyed the same, in a most barbarous Manner, never before heard of amongst <HI>Christians,</HI> with Fire and Murthers, and other execrable Cruel∣ties, and threatned the Countries of <HI>Branden∣burgh,</HI> and his <HI>Electoral Highness</HI>'s Subjects of <HI>Frankendale,</HI> with the same Inhumane Treat∣ment, which he has begun even already to put in Execution, and having committed other the like Attempts upon his <HI>Electoral Highness,</HI> and his Allies, as well within as without the <HI>Empire,</HI> directly contrary to the Treaty of Peace and Truce, in order to the total Ruine of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire; His <HI>Electoral Highness</HI> having re∣gard to the Resolution of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and the <HI>Dyet</HI> at <HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> is obliged to make use of the Power which God and Nature have put into his Hands, and to take up Arms for the Defence of his Subjects,</Q> and for the opposing with all

<P>And now the <HI>English,</HI> not to be behind-hand with other Nations, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses assembled in Parliament, waited upon his Majesty of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> on the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> and presented him an Address in the <HI>Banqueting-House,</HI> wherein, amongst other things, they de∣clared, <HI>That whenever his Majesty should think fit to enter into a War against the</HI> French <HI>King, they would give him such Assistance, in a</HI> Parliamentary <HI>Way, as might enable him (under the Protection that God Almighty has ever afforded him) to Support and go through with the same.</HI> To which <HI>His Ma∣jesty</HI> was graciously pleased to return this following Answer, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>The Confederate Armies by this Time began to draw together, which made <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. hasten his Troops, and form Two Armies under the Commands of the Duke of <HI>Duras,</HI> and <HI>Mareschal d' Humiers.</HI> Whereupon the Governour-General of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> caused a <HI>Declaration of War</HI> to be published against <HI>France;</HI> wherein, after he had set forth the Cruelty and Injustice of the <HI>French</HI> King, as the others had done, he forbids all Commerce, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon which <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. caused his <HI>Declaration of War</HI> to be proclaimed against <HI>Spain,</HI> at <HI>Marseilles, viz,</HI> on the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> and proceeded to fill all the Towns of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> that were not reduced to Ashes, with his Soldiers, as foreseeing the Storm that threat∣ned from so many Quarters of <HI>Europe;</HI> and, that such <HI>Protestants</HI> as were willing to avoid his cruel Usage and Extortions, might have Encourage∣ment to leave the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> their Ma∣jesties of <HI>Great Britain</HI> put forth a Proclamation, bearing Date the 25<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> for the Encoura∣ging the <HI>French Protestants</HI> to Transport them∣selves into this Kingdom, another Prohibiting the Importation of all Sorts of Manufactures, and Commodities whatsoever, of the Growth, Pro∣duction, or Manufacture of <HI>France.</HI> And on the 7<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May,</HI> a <HI>Declaration of War</HI> was Signed, and afterwards Published, setting forth, <HI>The perfidious Dealing of the</HI> French <HI>King, as well in</HI> Europe <HI>as in</HI> Africa, <HI>against the Subjects of</HI> England, &amp;c. And whilst these things were doing, News came from the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> Ad∣miral, with a Squadron of the King of <HI>Britains</HI> Ships, had engaged and worsted Forty four Sail of the <HI>French,</HI> being double the number of the
<PB N="172" REF="91"/><HI>English,</HI> as they were attempting to land Men and Arms in that Kingdom. And, to shew the <HI>French</HI> a farther Proof of our Naval Courage, the <HI>None-Such,</HI> a small Fourth Rate Frigat o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 36 Guns, meeting off of <HI>Guernsey</HI> with two <HI>French Men of War,</HI> one of 30 Guns, and 120 Men; the other of 16 Guns, 6 Pettereroes, and 120 Men, who were bound, with about Twenty small Mer∣chant Ships under their Convoy, to <HI>Newfound∣land,</HI> the <HI>English Man of War</HI> engaged them, but in the beginning of the Fight the Captain was killed, with the Master and Cook, and the Car∣penter wounded; upon which, there being no Lieutenant on Board, the Boatswain took upon him the Command of the Ship, and continued the Fight with that Bravery, that after a sharp En∣gagement of three Hours, he took both the <HI>French Men of War,</HI> and brought them into <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
<P>During these Transactions, <HI>Rhinburgh,</HI> that had been Garrisoned with <HI>French</HI> Troops by <HI>Car∣dinal Furstemburgh,</HI> surrendered to the <HI>Confede∣rates,</HI> and <HI>Keyserwaert</HI> was blocked up.

<PB N="173" REF="91"/><HI>Spire;</HI> in the latter whereof, the <HI>Imperial</HI>-Cham∣ber had a long time been kept, not leaving so much as a House standing. But a party of the Garrison of <HI>Bonne</HI> attempting to do the like to the Village of <HI>Hauff,</HI> the Country People took Arms, and falling upon them, killed about sixty of their Number, putting the rest to flight; and likewise several Parties of <HI>French</HI> Foragers, and such as were sent to make Incursions into the Countries that neighboured on their Garrison, were fre∣quently defeated. And now the <HI>Most Christian</HI> King finding himself hard beset, sought to cajole the <HI>Algerine</HI> Pirates to make a Peace with him, and fall upon the <HI>Confederates</HI> Merchants at Sea, although they had a little before so sensibly af∣fronted him, as to shoot off his <HI>Consul, &amp;c.</HI> and notwithstanding any Proposal, they would not hearken to any Treaty, unless he would redeem the <HI>French</HI> Captives, to the Number of 800, which he had demanded without any Ransom. And when his Agent perceived this would not take, he proposed a Truce, but that likewise was rejected by the <HI>Algerines.</HI></P>
<P>On the Ninth of <HI>June,</HI> the Marquess <HI>Choiseul</HI> passed the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Hunningen,</HI> with 4000 <HI>French</HI> Horse and Dragoons, and entered the Country of <HI>Durlach,</HI> declaring, That he came only to Forage, promising not to molest any that should remain quiet in their Houses; which the Country People relying on, thought they had nothing to fear; but they quickly found the little regard the <HI>French</HI> have to their Word: For no sooner had they posted themselves in the Places they designed, but the Country was given up to the Discretion of the Soldiers, who committed the most outrageous Insolencies, and Violencies, that can be imagined; So that many of the poor Peo∣ple
<PB N="174" REF="92"/>being plundered of all they had, and their persons abused, were driven before the Soldiers, like Sheep or Oxon, towards <HI>Friburgh</HI> and <HI>Brisac.</HI> A few indeed escaped to the <HI>Black Forrest,</HI> where several of them perished for Want, whilst the <HI>French</HI> were cutting up their Corn, and destroy∣ing the whole Country.</P>
<P>During these Proceedings, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. caused his <HI>Declaration of War</HI> against <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land</HI> to be published at <HI>Paris, viz.</HI> on the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>June,</HI> commanding his Fleet to put again to Sea, proposing great things to his Advantage. But as yet his Expections have been frustrated.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Keyserwaert</HI> being formally Be∣sieged, and closely pressed by the <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Forces, the Duke being before it in person, on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>June</HI> Monsieur <HI>Marcognet,</HI> the Go∣vernour, Capitulated, upon Notice the <HI>German</HI> Soldiers, in Garrison, were inclined to make Conditions for themselves without him; and a Parly being beat, the Capitulation was Signed the next Morning; by which it was agreed, <HI>That one of the Gates should be immediately delivered up; that the</HI> French <HI>Officers and Soldiers should march out the Day following with Arms and Baggage,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and be Conducted to</HI> Luxemburgh, <HI>but that the</HI> Germans <HI>should be at Liberty to go where they pleased, but not any more enter into the</HI> French <HI>Service.</HI> Whereupon most of them entered into the <HI>Duke</HI>'s Pay, and a great Number of <HI>French</HI> Soldiers deserted their Army, notwithstanding the severe Discipline to prevent it, by hanging up some Hundreds who had been taken going off. Nor did their Army in <HI>Flanders</HI> escape the angry Skies; for a violent Tempest happening, accompanied with extraor∣dinary Rains and Floods, divers Persons perished, a great deal of Baggage was spoiled, and carri∣ed
<PB N="175" REF="92"/>away in by the Rapidity of the Torrent, and the Mareschal <HI>d' Humiers,</HI> who commanded in Chief, hardly escaped drowning. And although the <HI>French</HI> King laboured by many secret In∣trigues and Contrivances, to widen, or keep on foot, the Differences between the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Holstein;</HI> yet by the Medi∣ation of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and <HI>Electors</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bandenburgh,</HI> an Accomodation was made, and Signed on the Thirtieth of <HI>June,</HI> upon sun∣dry Articles. Upon this News, upon what Ac∣count we are yet to learn, the Duke <HI>De la Force,</HI> and the Marquess <HI>Vivaus,</HI> were clapped up in the <HI>Bastile</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and their Papers se∣cured. The Duchess <HI>De la Force</HI> was likewise sent Prisoner to the Castle of <HI>Angers:</HI> And a∣bout the same time, a <HI>French</HI> Man of War, of Thirty six Guns, and Two hundred Men, was taken by two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, and carried into <HI>Am∣sterdam.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Forces Besieging <HI>Lon∣don-Derry,</HI> were beaten off with great Slaughter; and, amongst others, many Principal Officers were killed, which obliged them, upon the Ci∣ty's being Relieved with Provision, to raise the Siege, and retire in some Confusion.</P>
<P>The French Forces likewise in <HI>Catalonia</HI> were beaten by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and upon the Approach of the Imperial Army, quitted all, or most of the Places they yet held in the <HI>Palatinate.</HI> And now the Storm of War threatning <HI>Montz</HI> and <HI>Bonne,</HI> the only strong Places the Frence held in those Parts, the Marquess <HI>Ʋxelles,</HI> Governour of the former, sent to the Court of <HI>France</HI> to demand speedy Aid; but had no other Answer returned him as to that particular, than, that the King had sent the Arrear-Ban towards the
<PB N="176" REF="93"/>Coasts, and that by reason of some Disappoint∣ments, he must not expect very Powerful Suc∣cours, for that there were every where too great Occasion for their Troops, the Enemy having never had such numerous Forces in the Field, as at present. For at that time, the Army Com∣manded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was composed of 20000 <HI>Imperial</HI> Foot, and 8000 Horse, 10000 <HI>Saxons,</HI> 8000 <HI>Lunenburghers,</HI> and 6000 of <HI>Hesse-Cassel.</HI> The <HI>Bavarian</HI> Army, with the Troops of <HI>Suabia</HI> 14000, with which were joined 8000 <HI>Imperialists</HI> under <HI>Caprapra.</HI> The Forces of the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> amounted to 32000, those of <HI>Munster</HI> 6000, which with the 3000 <HI>Hollanders</HI> that were in that Country, and the 8000 after∣ward sent by the Duke of <HI>Hanouer,</HI> amounted to 123000 Men, not accounting the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Armies in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> These ex∣traordinary Forces made <HI>Lewis the Great</HI> begin to look about him more than ever, labouring with the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> to hold a Neutrality, to which he found him no ways inclinable. And the <HI>Pope's Nuntio</HI> being called Home, to prevent the <HI>Clergy</HI> flocking to him in his way, an Officer, contrary to Custom, was sent to him out of the Kingdom, and published an <HI>Ordinance,</HI> com∣manding all the Subjects of <HI>France,</HI> whose Fa∣thers, Children, or Brothers, are in the Ser∣vice of his Enemies, and the Women, whose Husbands are in that Service, to depart the Kingdom within the space of a Month, which was, in many Places, put rigorously in Execu∣tion.</P>
<P>The French Troops under the Command of the Duke <HI>Duras,</HI> making an Attempt upon <HI>Heidel∣burgh,</HI> the Regiment of <HI>Wertemburgh</HI> got oppor∣tunely into the Town, and beat them off, with
<PB N="177" REF="93"/>the loss of Three or Four hundred of their Men. And in <HI>Flanders,</HI> about Forty <HI>English</HI> Horse meeting with a greater Number of <HI>French,</HI> kil∣led Fifteen, and took Eight Prisoners. These bad Successes, one upon the Neck of another, made the <HI>French</HI> King cause his Orders to be published, Commanding the Inhabitants of <HI>Se∣dan, Mezieres,</HI> and other Places, not to Sow their Ground with Corn this Year, on pain of Death, promising they should be furnished other ways.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to mention all the Skirmishes that passed this <HI>Campaign</HI> with vari∣ous Success, though mostly to the Advantage of the Confederates: Wherefore, passing many over, we come to Instance that great Engage∣ment between the French, under the Command of the Mareschal <HI>d' Humiers;</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> under the Command of Prince <HI>Wal∣deck, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The French Troops Attacking the Village <HI>Forge,</HI> where Eight hundred Men were Posted under the Command of Collonel <HI>Hodges,</HI> and Lieutenant-Collonel <HI>Goes,</HI> they bravely defended it, till sending one Party after another on both sides, the two Armies, in a manner, Engaged; where the <HI>English,</HI> more especially, behaved themselves with such Bravery and Resolution, that after a long and obstinate Fight, the <HI>French</HI> gave Ground, and retired in some Confusion, leaving behind them their Cannon and Ammu∣nition, and about Three thousand Killed and Wounded. And the Six Battalions of Guards were for the most part cut off, which Loss may be best guessed at by the following Account.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Gelais,</HI> Mareschal of the Camp, was killed with a Cannon-Shot, as likewise were
<PB N="178" REF="94"/>Monsieur <HI>de Metz Tirecelin,</HI> Commissary of the Artillery. Killed of the Guards the Count <HI>d' Artuagan,</HI> four Captains, five Lieutenants, a Gentleman-Voluntier wounded. Three Ca∣ptains, eleven Lieutenants, the Aid-Major, and two Voluntiers of the Regiment of <HI>Campaign,</HI> the Chavalier <HI>de Colbert,</HI> Brigadier and Collonel, mortally wounded, the Lieutenant-Collonel wounded, the Major mortally wounded, two Captains killed, two Lieutenants killed, five Captains and seven Lieutenants wounded, the Liutenant of the Artillery wounded; of the <HI>Gensd'arms,</HI> an Exempt of the Guards wounded; of <HI>Vilpians</HI> Regiment of Horse killed one Captain, wounded a Cornet and Aid-Major; of <HI>Greders</HI> Regiment of Foot, killed one Captain and Aid-Major, wounded two Captains, one Aid-Major, and a Lieutenant, several of the wounded dy∣ing of their Wounds soon after the Battel. This blow greatly allarmed the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and might have put <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. into another Fit of his Ague, had not cordial News come from <HI>Rome,</HI> of the Death of <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> XI. upon which, he immediately sent away the Count <HI>de Chaulms.</HI> his Ambassador; and the <HI>French</HI> Car∣dinals, such as he would trust with his Interest, prepared to follow him, in order to make his Party in the Election of a new <HI>Pope.</HI> But when they came to <HI>Rome,</HI> their Admission into the <HI>Conclave</HI> was disputed, till such time the <HI>French</HI> King should relinquish his Pretensions to the <HI>franchises,</HI> which at last was agreed to be done, during the time of Election. But it so fell out, that neither the <HI>French</HI> Interest nor Gold was so Powerful as heretofore; for, after some Con∣test amongst the Factions, Cardinal <HI>Ottoboni,</HI> a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> was Elected, and Confirmed
<PB N="179" REF="94"/><HI>Pope</HI> by the Name of <HI>Alexander</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Mentz</HI> having been violently At∣tacked by the Confederates, under the Com∣mand of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and others; and the Duke <HI>Duras</HI> in vain watching an Opportu∣nity to relieve it, with an Army of between Six∣teen and Eighteen thousand Men; the Besieged beat a Parly, and on the Eighth of <HI>August</HI> Hosta∣ges were exchanged, and on the Ninth the Ca∣pitulation was Signed; in pursuance whereof the Place was Surrendered, and the <HI>French</HI> Garrison marched out, <HI>viz.</HI> 4500 Foot, 400 Dragoons, 280 Horse, besides six or 700 Foot, that went in small parties with the Baggage, being the Remainder of 10000 that were in Garrison at the beginning of the Siege. The reduction of this strong Place, that had cost so great a Summ in Fortifying, and in which such confidence had been reposed, did not a little startle the Court of <HI>France;</HI> and, as is usual upon such Emergen∣cies, occasioned the change of a great many Mini∣sters of State. And what heightned the Con∣sternation more, was a fear of a General Revolt of the <HI>Protestants</HI> of that Kingdom, seeing many of them forced their Way through the French Barriers of <HI>Languedock, Provence,</HI> and <HI>Dauphin,</HI> and brought Terrour upon <HI>Savoy,</HI> (the only stickling Prince for <HI>France,</HI>) joining with others in the Valleys of <HI>Piemont, Lucern, &amp;c.</HI> which ob∣liged the French King to keep strong Guards on the Frontier Places of <HI>Dauphin:</HI> And some French Troops attempting to burn the Corn near <HI>Ghent,</HI> were so warmly received by the Cannon of the Town, and an Ambushment laid in a hollow Way, that most of them were cut off. And now perceiving they must quit the <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Trier,</HI> they resolved to use it with the same Civility
<PB N="180" REF="95"/>they had done the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> burning ten Towns, beside what they had formerly Consumed, and laying that fruitful Country Waste like a Wil∣derness; and farther proceeded to burn <HI>Franken∣dale, Neustadt, Lubesheim, Pettersheim, Dirmin∣stheim, Wachenheim,</HI> with several other Places, and a great many Villages in <HI>Housdurgh.</HI> Which <HI>Ʋnchristian</HI> Proceedings demonstrated their Power to be of short Durance in those Countries.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Bonne,</HI> Fortified by the Care and Diligence of Cardinal <HI>Furstemberg,</HI> at the extra∣ordinary Charge of the <HI>French</HI> King, having been a considerable time Besieged by the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and making a stout Resistance, despairing of Relief, was constrained on the 10th. of <HI>October</HI> to beat a Parly, and sent out three Officers to treat about Articles of Surrender, which were finally concluded; and Signed on the 12th. under Seventeen Heads, considerably Honoura∣ble to the Garrison; and the same Day, Three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undred Men of the Troops of <HI>Brandenburgh, Hol∣land,</HI> and <HI>Munster,</HI> took Possession of one of the Gates of the Town, and on the Fifteenth the Garrison, which at the beginning of the Siege con∣sisted of 7000 Men, marched out to the number of 3500, and 1500 remained sick and wounded in the Town. The Governour Count <HI>Alsfelt,</HI> was carried out in a Litter, and all the Stores and Cannon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were delivered up to the <HI>Elector.</HI> So that by the Loss of this Town, the <HI>French</HI> lost their footing in those <HI>Parts,</HI> and began to think of going into Winter-Quarters, after having in∣damaged those Countries more than Forty milli∣ons can repair, in one <HI>Campaign.</HI> Whereupon, to be rid of so cruel and wastful a People, the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> published his <HI>Avocatoria,</HI> commanding all the <HI>French</HI> to depart out of his Dominions; when,
<PB N="181" REF="95"/>on the other hand, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. lay great Taxes to raise Money for his carrying on the next <HI>Cam∣paign.</HI></P>
<P>We might enlarge upon many other Particu∣lars, to display this Ambitious and Bloodthirsty <HI>Monarch,</HI> who has been so long the Troubler of <HI>Europe,</HI> as his League with the Empire, his sol∣liciting them to make no Peace, and encou∣raging them to stand off, by promises of the powerful Diversions he intends to make in the <HI>Western</HI> Parts.
