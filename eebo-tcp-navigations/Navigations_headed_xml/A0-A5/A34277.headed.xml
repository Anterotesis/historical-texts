<HEAD>A Congratulatory Poem, Dedicated to his Excellency, the <HI>Ambassador,</HI> from the Emperor of <HI>Fez,</HI> and <HI>Morocco.</HI></HEAD>
<L>SErene SIR, you'r Welcome to the Nation,</L>
<L>A Man of Honour, and Splendid in your station;</L>
<L>Whose noble worth, and ever-matchless Fame,</L>
<L>Does cause the vulgar to applaud the same.</L>
<L>Had th' <HI>Indian</HI> King no other Man to send</L>
<L>But th'Duke his Brother, and his Natural Friend?</L>
<L>Surely this love it must be reckoned high</L>
<L>By us, pretenders to Civility;</L>
<L>Should we not render good for good, when we</L>
<L>(Nay, all the World) knows your Conformity:</L>
<L>Therefore to be uncivil to a Stranger,</L>
<L>Is like to a Dog snarling in a Manger:</L>
<L>For, saies the Philosopher, an untaught Man</L>
<L>Flies off from Nature, and from Reason strong;</L>
<L>He's worse then the Beasts in doing so ill,</L>
<L>For they act according to their Species still:</L>
<L>So that an ignorant and rude Man's but at best,</L>
<L>A kind of Manly unmannerly Beast;</L>
<L>To affront a stranger out of his Country dear,</L>
<L>That out of love comes to us about <HI>Tangier:</HI></L>
<L>I do protest it was so wondrous rude,</L>
<L>That nothing could do it but th'multitude,</L>
<L>A sort of Beasts that knows nothing but to Eat</L>
<L>And Drink, be drunk, and then lye down and sleep.</L>
<L>Wise Men and of understanding high,</L>
<L>Were angry at the Multitudes folly:</L>
<L>Whilst Noble <HI>English</HI>-men such crimes detest,</L>
<L>And scorn to bear such thoughts within their breast:</L>
<L>Ignorance is so great a Monster, 'tis begot</L>
<L>Only by Eating, and by the idle Pot;</L>
<L>Whereas Men of Learning and pruden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e still,</L>
<L>Are civil to <HI>Ambassadors,</HI> 'tis their will:</L>
<L>A rude Man is no Man, but a Glass Bottle,</L>
<L>According to the Precepts of <HI>Aristotle:</HI></L>
<L>So those that affronted you are really none</L>
<L>But Flies, and Fleas, and Scare-Bees of the Sun:</L>
<L>Like Fish with springing Tides come up in Shoals,</L>
<L>And night draws on the play of Batts and Owls:</L>
<L>So may the Rabble fitly compared be</L>
<L>To these poor Creatures of stupidity:</L>
<L>Therefore pray Sir, let it all pass over,</L>
<L>And don't Record it with your good Red Oker.</L>
<L>You are a Horse-man good, a Marks-man straight,</L>
<L>The like it has never been seen of late;</L>
<L>With throwing of a Dart up to the Sky,</L>
<L>Catching it again, when falling from on high,</L>
<L>And with his Launce he runs it through a Ring,</L>
<L>Performing of that beyond any thing;</L>
<PB REF="2"/>
<L>And at a large, distance his Javelin lets flye,</L>
<L>And shoots a Man in order for to dye:</L>
<L>Thus is he accomplish'd in the Arts most high,</L>
<L>Of swift, Horsman ship, and good Archery▪</L>
<L>Which pleas'd the King so extreamly, well,</L>
<L>Quoth he where's the Man that can this parallel:</L>
<L>Besides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>ead your Noble Speech,</L>
<L>Enough a great Christian for to teach.</L>
<L>Shewing though you'r dark without, you'r Fair within▪</L>
<L>Innocence in action is the beauty of each thing;</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> demonsstrated to us from Nature's Eye;</L>
<L>The Star <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brightest in the Cloudiest Sky,</L>
<L>A Metaphor for your Exceliency high,</L>
<L>Nature's great Wonder in Epitomy.</L>
<L>We thank you therefore for your Visit fine,</L>
<L>And as a Star in Friendships Orb doth shine:</L>
<L>Glisten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you go to your own Country dear,</L>
<L>And part with poor <HI>Englands</HI> Hemisphere;</L>
<L>And when you'r gone, this we will proclaim,</L>
<L>You left behind you a sweet and Rosie Name:</L>
<L>Absence in love it is a kind of Death.</L>
<L>Before we do descend to Mother-Earth:</L>
<L>Life's but an Embassie, having been heard,</L>
<L>What's to be done, and what to be learn'd;</L>
<L>It is then gone, and so vanishes away,</L>
<L>As Mists are lost upon a Rainy day;</L>
<L>Till the Sun breaks out afresh and agen,</L>
<L>To chear the hearts of all the Sons of Men:</L>
<L>Teaching how first we live, and then we dye,</L>
<L>And so go off to all Eternity.</L>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>Loves Vision.</HEAD>
<L>ON <HI>Candlemas</HI>-day there did repair and go</L>
<L>To <HI>White-Hall,</HI> the Ambassador of <HI>Morooco;</HI></L>
<L>To see that high and most renowned place,</L>
<L>And each fine Lord deck'd up with Golden lace;</L>
<L>From thence he went into <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI></L>
<L>There to espy and there discover all:</L>
<L>The Courts of Justice where the <HI>Judges</HI> sit,</L>
<L>Men great in wisdome and acute in wit.</L>
<L>To'th' <HI>Abby</HI> he repairs, and there doth see</L>
<L>Effigies of Nobles sent on Embassie.</L>
<L>And so to <HI>Westminster</HI>-School he doth repair,</L>
<L>To see that place where Learning is most rare.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the prospect of the famous School,</L>
<L>That renders wise beyond each idle Fool,</L>
<L>At last Traveller like, comes on his way,</L>
<L>With all agility without the least delay,</L>
<L>To his Apartment and his own dear home,</L>
<L>As Night is struck from the departing Sun.</L>
