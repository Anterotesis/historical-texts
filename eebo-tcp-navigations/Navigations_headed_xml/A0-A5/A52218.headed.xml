<HEAD>News from the East-Indies.</HEAD>
<P>THE Committee of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company and their Abettors having made so great a noise on the <HI>Exchange</HI> last Week, of the advantageous Peace they had obtain'd of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> by which the <HI>Notional Stock</HI> was raised from 112. to 150. <HI>per Cent.</HI> And it being declared at the <HI>East-India</HI> House, That the Articles by the new <HI>Phirmaund</HI> (or <HI>Patent</HI>) should be Printed for General Satisfaction; It was with great Earnest∣ness expected; in hopes it would appear for the Honour and Advantage of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. But in lieu thereof, there only appears in the <HI>Mondays</HI> Gazette a simple Intimation, <HI>That a Peace is made, and that we enjoy the same, <HI>yea</HI> and greater Privileges than formerly.</HI></P>
<P>Now, That the Nation may be fully informed of the true State of the Mat∣ter, and that Widows and other honest and well-meaning Persons, Strangers to the Management of the Company's Affairs may not be misled, and for the general Good and Service of all; An Exact Copy of the <HI>Phirmaund</HI> for the Bay of <HI>Bengale,</HI> which is one of the principal Ports in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Dominions, is here presented; as the Translation is sent to the Company from <HI>Surrat</HI> in the following Words.</P>
<P>[<HI>'Tis directed to</HI> Ibrahim Chaune, <HI>who is one of the</HI> Mogul<HI>'s great</HI> Governours, <HI>Dated the</HI> 27th. <HI>of</HI> April, <HI>in the</HI> 33d. <HI>Year of his Reign.</HI>]</P>

<P><HI>KNow this, That the Good Fortune of the</HI> English <HI>hath directed them the Right way to end their Faults, they are sorry and ashamed for what they have done, therefore have sent their Vakeels</HI> [Factors] <HI>to our noble Court, with a Petition for a gracious</HI> Phirmaund <HI>to pardon their Faults; which the King, out of his great Favour and Mercy, always ready to pardon, doth freely forgive them; therefore his clear and un∣spotted Order is such, which you are to observe as you do his that you pray to, That so soon as this gracious</HI> Phirmaund <HI>reaches your hands, you suffer no body in your Jurisdi∣ction to molest, hurt, or hinder the</HI> English Nation <HI>in their Business, but suffer them to carry it on in the same manner as formerly. This understand, and act accordingly.</HI></P>

<P>THis is the Instrument that stands upon Record in the Court of that Great Prince, to the Eternal Infamy of the <HI>English</HI> Nation; as the Effect of our most unjust and unaccountable War, whereby not only the Honour of the <HI>English</HI> (before in the highest Esteem,) but the Interest of the Company in particular, hath suffered an Immense, and irreparable Damage; tho some few Managers) by unwarrantable and indirect Means, have gain'd prodigious Estates. For, as to the Nation and Company, after the loss of six years Trade, and the destruction of many considerable Ships, and the death of many hun∣dreds of our best Seamen: The Condition on which we are now re-admitted to Trade, is, That full Restitution be made to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Subjects for all the Ships and Goods the Company have taken, according to the Accounts which shall be given in by the <HI>Crannies</HI> [or <HI>Pursers</HI>] of the Ships taken by the <HI>English;</HI> And tho we cannot yet tell the certain Sum which must be made good, We may shrewdly ghess at it from the Evidence given in the Cause now depend∣ing
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"/>between Their Majesties and the Company, on account of those Prizes, wherein a great number of Witnesses have deposed to the value of above One Million Sterling; Besides which, they are likewise indebted in <HI>India,</HI> at no small Interest, above Three hundred thousand Pounds more, and no less a Sum here at Home, on Bond, and for Freight and Demurrage: Whilst all their Stock in <HI>England</HI> will not extend to discharge their late made Dividend; nor all their Effects abroad, to load home one Third of the Shipping, now in <HI>India,</HI> besides the great Sums they owe to those Ships for their Service and Demurrage; which is not only manifest by the Liberty and Encouragement they give to private Men to return their particular Estates on those Bottoms, but especially by the general Letter which accompanied the <HI>Phirmaund,</HI> written to the Company by their Factors at <HI>Surrat,</HI> whereby they earnestly press for a large and speedy Supply to support and carry on the Trade.</P>
<P>In consideration of these exorbitant Impositions on the Nation, and from a true Affection to their Country, there are some Gentlemen and Merchants who have long applied their Thoughts to the restoring this so considerable a Trade, and in order thereto are prepared to lay before our Honourable Representatives in Parliament at their next Session, a clear and ample Account by what ways and means the Credit and Interest of the <HI>English</HI> Nation in <HI>India,</HI> hath been reduc'd to so miserable a Condition, and in the interim they hope it may not be an unac∣ceptable Service to the Publick, That they offer this brief Advertisement for Caution against the presumptuous Impositions of daring and arbitrary Men, who have of late Years encreased their Estates by the Ruin of their Fellow-Sub∣jects, and have been the Instruments of this great Dishonour and Detriment to their Country.</P>
