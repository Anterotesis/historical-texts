<P>THe States Generall of the vnited Prouinces, vnto all those that shall see these, greeting. We make knowne, that we considering the good of these Lands, and the welfare of the inhabitants of them, to consist principally in the nauigation and traffike which in all times out of these Countries with good successe and blessings in all kingdomes and countries haue continued. And desiring that the said inhabitants not onely main∣taine and keepe their former nauigations and traffikes, but likewise as much as is possible increase the same, and prin∣cipally according to the treaties, alliances, contracts and en∣tercourses concerning the traffike and nauigation with o∣ther Princes, Commonwealths and Nations in former times made, which we vnderstand in all points to be kept and obserued. And we perceiuing that without a common helpe, assistance and meanes of a generall Companie, no∣thing can be vndertaken in the places hereafter specified for to get profit and to maintaine and defend the same, in regard of piracies, extorsions and other like matters happe∣ning such long nauigations. We haue in regard of these and other weightie reasons and considerations mouing vs vnto the same as likewise ripe deliberations of our Counsels, and other pregnant and weightie occasions mouing vs in like maner found good, that the nauigation, traffike and com∣merce in the quarters of the <HI>West Indies</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and other places named hereafter in times following, no more shall be exercised and vsed then by common and vnited power of Merchants and inhabitants of these Countries, and that to the same purpose shall be erected a generall Companie, which we in regard of our singular affection and loue to the common good, and to preserue the inhabi∣tants of the same in traffike and welfare, shall maintaine and strengthen with help, fauour and assistance, for as much
<PB REF="3"/> as the present state and condition of these countries in any maner of wayes can permit, prouiding for the same a fit grant, with priuiledges and liberties, here following: viz. That within the terme of foure and twentie yeares, none of the natiues or inhabitants of these Countries, otherwise then onely by the authoritie of the vnited Companie of these vnited Prouinces, or from any other country shall nauigate or traffike vpon the coasts and lands of <HI>Africa,</HI> from <HI>Topica, Cancri,</HI> vntill <HI>Cabo de bonna Esperanca,</HI> nei∣ther vpon the countries of <HI>America</HI> or <HI>West India,</HI> begin∣ning from the South end of <HI>Terra noua,</HI> through the straight of <HI>Magellanus le Maire</HI> or other straights or passages thereabout, vntill the straight of <HI>Anian,</HI> as well vpon the North as South sea, neither vpon any Ilands either at the one or other side, or betwixt them both situated; likewise neither vpon the <HI>Austriall</HI> or Southlands lying betwixt both <HI>Meridians,</HI> touching at the East side <HI>Cabo de bonna Esperanca,</HI> and at the West side, the East side of <HI>Noua Gui∣nea,</HI> inclusiue. And if any man without leaue of the said Companie shall saile or traffike into any of these aforesaid limits granted vnto this Companie, the ships and goods shall be forfeited, hauing traffiked in any of the aforesaid parts, which immediatly euery way shall be taken and sei∣sed vpon by the Companie, and kept for the vse and bene∣fit of the same. And in case such ships or goods shall be sold, or landed in other countries or ports, shall the Mer∣chant venturers and participants be answerable for the va∣lue of the ships and goods, and be conuicted for the same, with this caution, that those that before this graunt of these or other countries are sailed vnto any of these coasts, may sell their goods and returne backe againe in these lands; or otherwise vntill their grant is expired (if they haue gotten any before this time) continue, and not longer, obseruing that no body now at the beginning shall send any ships or goods into the parts in this Patent comprehended, not∣withstanding at the same time perhaps the Companie be not fully concluded, prouiding for the same as is fit, and
<PB REF="3"/> against them that wilfully against our good intention shall seeke to wrong the generall good. We vnderstand neuer∣thelesse that it shall be free for euery one to fetch salt from <HI>Ponte del Re,</HI> but vpon conditions and instructions by vs allowed or to be allowed, without otherwise in any maner to be tied vnto this grant.</P>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="article">

Furthermore they shall search plen∣tifull and not vninhabited places to plant the same, and do euery thing that will be good for the seruice and profit of the Countrie, and which the increase of traffike will re∣quire. And these of the Companie shall from time to time communicate to vs, and deliuer such contracts and allian∣ces as they shall make with the said Princes and nations, besides the situations of the forts, places of defence, and plantations by them taken in hand.</P>
