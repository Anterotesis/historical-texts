<P>AS your Lordships concern in <HI>East-Jersey,</HI> makes it appear to all intelligent persons, that it is a <HI>Nationall interest</HI> to advance in generall the design of a Plantation, hence to <HI>A∣merica;</HI> so that in particular, <HI>East-Jersey</HI>
<PB REF="3"/> is the most proper place; seeing your Lordships have chosen it among all the other parts of that continent, to settle your interest there; Yet my <HI>Lords,</HI> there are (to our shame) a parcell of people, who whether out of Ignorance or Malice, I cannot well determine, decry the design; I believe they have a share of both, and thereby weakens not a little the hands of a number of well meaning people, who would gladly promot the same effect∣ualy, were they not imposed upon by the false rumours, industriously spread abroad to stiffle any such inclinations.</P>
<P>I have been advised to consent to the publishing of the following sheets, at first collected, only for my own divertise∣ment, and more clear information in the affair; As what may tend some what to prevent any foolish misrepresentation when by the perusall of the accompts, from thence the least jealousie is removed of any cheat in the thing it self, so ad∣vantagious a Character of the place com∣ing from so many different hands.</P>
<P>I have had too many demonstrations, of your Lordships favour, to fear your displeasure upon accompt of my presum∣ing
<PB REF="3"/> to send the same abroad under your <HI>Patrociny;</HI> yea, I dare further adventure, without the least apprehension of your dissatisfaction with me upon that head, to mind your Lordships that as you have laid the foundation of this design, as to any concern of this Countrey, in that place; so it is expected your Lordships will continue to encourage the same: in process of time your Lordships may render your Names and Families as con∣siderable in <HI>America</HI> as they are in <HI>Europ.</HI></P>
<P>My Lords, having resolved to dedi∣cate my self, Family, and Fortune, to the promoting of this design; I should the more easily digest any frauns of Providence I have been trysted with; were I so fortunat as to find the opportunity, in <HI>Jersey</HI> of testifying my resentments of the favours I have received at your Lordships hands in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by notice∣ing any of your Lordships concerns there, and contributing what in me lyes to ad∣vance the same; nothing shall be want∣ing in me to testifie how much I am,</P>

<HEAD>An Account of the Incouragement for promoting a Design of Planting; in <HI>East-New-Jersey,</HI> containing the Con∣stitutions, and Model of Government of that Province, in a Letter from a Gentleman at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> concerned there; to his Correspondent in the Countrey.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>PErceiving by your last Discourse, that you not only appeared somewhat re∣solved to be your self concerned in</HI> pro∣moting the present Design of car∣rying on a Plantation in <HI>America,</HI> but to endeavour to engage several of your Friends in the same undertaking, when you found any probability of its taking effect. <HI>I find my self obliged for your more full Information <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> let you know at more length the Reasons, inducing me to be so much concerned in the promo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing this Affair, submitting very willingly, the grounds promp∣ting me hereto, to your most narrow scrutiny, whether in so doing I act Rationally or not?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having at</HI> London <HI>in the year</HI> 1679, <HI>the opportunity of frequent converse with several
<PB N="2" REF="5"/> Substantial and Judicious Gentlemen, concerned in the</HI> American Plantations, <HI>I had thereby the opportunity of understanding throughly the great advantage redounding to that City, from</HI> Undertakings of this nature, <HI>and rational grounds of Conjecture,</HI> That their Com∣merce with that place of the World, hath been one of the greatest Improve∣ments of that Trade, they have for ma∣ny years enjoyed, which hath rendered it now one of the most considerable Ci∣ties in <HI>Europe;</HI> the Customes thereof which in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, were farmed at <HI>Fifty thousand pounds,</HI> paying now in to the Exchequer, near <HI>seven hun∣dred thousand pounds</HI> yearly, which great Improvement may be much attribute to their Trade with <HI>America,</HI> brought now in a great manner to Perfection, which at that time was but in its Infancy.</P>
<P><HI>From that time I began to have strong in∣clinations, to be more fully informed in that Affair, and to be at all imaginable pains, to notice the same verie concernedly▪ and for my more full satisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction, I judged i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> requisit to trace the verie beginnings of all the</HI> English Plantations, <HI>and their gradual progresses ere they arrived at that perfection they presently
<PB N="3" REF="5"/> are at; I could not rest satisfied with the first Methods I proposed to my self, in Order to this, of discoursing at large with such as had been in the several Plantations, by putting such in∣terrogators to them thereanent, as I judged most proper, for informing my self in all things relative to that knowledge, I judged requisit for my own clear information, and for being a foundation to a Design I then began to frame, of being therein my self some way interested; And tho I found one and the same accompt given me in Solution of the most material Questions I proposed; Yea, from several hands, who were such, whose knowledge in other things with the good Character they generally went under, obliged me to notice their infor∣mation as truth without the least jealousing the verity of the accompt they gave me; yet for my more full satisfaction, I proposed what I judged would contribute more clearly to my full understanding that affair, to wit, the perusal of all the Geographicall descriptions of these places in</HI> America <HI>inhabited by the</HI> English.</P>
<P><HI>The first thing which offered to my view, in this search, was a question in it self, both pleasant and material,</HI> What way the continent of <HI>America</HI> came first to be in∣habited after the Flood, it being a World
<PB N="4" REF="6"/> wholly unknown to the <HI>Europeans, Asia∣ticks</HI> and <HI>Africans,</HI> till the late discovery thereof by <HI>Americus Vesputius,</HI> and <HI>Cristo∣phorus Columbus,</HI> since by all ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cumstan∣ces, it is apparent that it hath been long inhabited: <HI>Laetius in his discourse anent the Original of the</HI> Americans, <HI>Declaring,</HI> That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> destroyed thirty mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lions of them in these parts of <HI>America,</HI> usurped by them, which is not the 100 part of that continent. <HI>And since it is by all a∣greed, that after the Flood,</HI> Noah and his three Sons had their habitations in some parts of <HI>Asia; there being no probable eviden∣cies that any of their Descendants led out the first Collonies thither, being so divided from the rest of the World,</HI> to wit, <HI>from the</HI> West∣ern <HI>coast of</HI> Europe, <HI>and</HI> Africa, <HI>by the vast</HI> Atlantick Ocean, <HI>from the</HI> North parts <HI>of</HI> Europe, <HI>by the great frozen Seas lying be∣twixt it and</HI> Green-land, <HI>appearing to be the</HI> Northern Coast of America, <HI>from the</HI> Northern part of Asia, Tartaria <HI>and</HI> Ca∣that, <HI>by the</HI> Fretum Annium, <HI>from the</HI> Fast part of China, <HI>and the</HI> Philippine Islands, <HI>by the</HI> Oceanus Pacificus, <HI>above</HI> 2000. <HI>Leagues in breadth, and divided from the great lately discovered Island</HI> Delphago,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/> <HI>by the Straits of</HI> Magellan; <HI>and that Island divided again from the uttermost</HI> Southern Continent <HI>(if any be) by a great Sea not formerly known to the</HI> Europeans, <HI>and</HI> Asia∣ticks, <HI>being divided from</HI> Asia <HI>and</HI> Africa, <HI>by the great</HI> Indian Ocean, <HI>lately discove∣red by</HI> De La Mers Navigation; <HI>the only probable means of such a Migration, being of a far later perfection, than what could answer such a population of so great a continent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To this apparently difficult question I find a very satisfying answer given verie fullie by the Learned</HI> Hales, <HI>his Assertion, to wit,</HI> That notwithstand∣ing these apparent difficulties, a Migrati∣on unto <HI>America</HI> from the Descendants of <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> was not onely possible, but probable, that the samine was suc∣cessive, that tho the time or manner of these Migrations cannot certainly be de∣fined, yet many of them were long since, some thousand of years; Yet after the universal Deluge, that the means of this Transmigration of the Descendents of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> from <HI>Asia</HI> unto <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> hath been both by Sea and Land. That the readiest means of the Migra∣tion of Colonies unto the <HI>Western World,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/> from the <HI>Eastern,</HI> was by the help of Na∣vigation, whereof much might be cas∣ual by Tempests, or contrary Winds. <HI>But the more Principle from design, he judging it probable,</HI> that the use of Ships was not unknown to the Old World before the Flood, tho not in that perfection that af∣ter; But that the Ark of <HI>Noah,</HI> being an exact piece of <HI>Arihitecture,</HI> did give a patron for Vessels of a greater burden, that from that time the skill of making and navigating Ships had been certainly improved. <HI>Heathnish Histories giving us accompt, that Navigation was ancient among the</HI> Grecians, <HI>especiallie among the</HI> Pheni∣cians, Tyrians, <HI>and</HI> Carthaginians Pliny <HI>in his Natural History, relating,</HI> That the Navigation of the <HI>Argonauts</HI> to <HI>Colchis</HI> for the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> happened about 1000. years after the Flood; And that 200. years before that, <HI>Danaus</HI> sailed out of <HI>Aegypt</HI> unto <HI>Greece. And tho there be no ex∣press mention of the</HI> Pixis <HI>Nautica for ma∣nie years, after the mention of the use of Navi∣gation, yet the same Author relates,</HI> That the <HI>Phenicians</HI> steered their Course by obser∣vation of the Stars.</P>
<P><HI>But the</HI> Sacred Scripture <HI>gives a better
<PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y"/> accompt of the Antiquitie of Navigation,</HI> Ja∣cob <HI>died</HI> 600. <HI>years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Flood, yet he mentioned</HI> Ships and Havens for shipping, <HI>as things well known; and particularlie</HI> Si∣don, as a great Port for shipping, where <HI>Zebulons</HI> Lott was to be cast, Gen. 49.13. Balaam <HI>in the time of</HI> Moses <HI>mentions,</HI> the Ships of <HI>Chittim,</HI> or <HI>Grecians,</HI> as a known thing, Numb. 24.24. <HI>In the Reign of</HI> Solomon, <HI>the</HI> Tyrians <HI>are noticed as expert Seamen, he having a Navie upon the Coast of the</HI> Red-Sea, <HI>from thence making Voyages with the</HI> Tyrans <HI>to</HI> Ophir, <HI>and</HI> Tarshish, <HI>places apparentlie in the</HI> East Indies, <HI>thence bringing Gold and other Commodities,</HI> 1 Chr: 8.18.9.21.</P>
<P><HI>The Histories of all succeeding Ages of the</HI> Grecians <HI>and</HI> Persians, <HI>of the</HI> Tyrians, Phenicians <HI>and</HI> Carthaginians, <HI>of the</HI> Ro∣mans, Aegyptians <HI>and</HI> Chinenses; <HI>And in the latter times of the</HI> Venetians, Sicilians <HI>and</HI> Rhodians, Spanish, Dutch, French, <HI>and</HI> English, <HI>give us a full accompt, how Sedulous and Industrious all Maritim Coasts have been in advancing of Navigation in mul∣tiplying of Shipping, in Merchandizing and Trading in searching out and subduing For∣raign Countries, when either afflicted at home

<P><HI>And therefore sayes the forecited Author, as latter years, hath given us of this Age witness of the Transplantations to</HI> America, <HI>from</HI> Spain, France, Portugal, England, Scot∣land, <HI>and</HI> Holland, <HI>and some Ages before that have given instances of Transplantations f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om</HI> Norway <HI>unto</HI> Green-land, <HI>and</HI> Ise∣land; <HI>So it appears not onely possible, but pro∣bable, that either by Casuality or Tempest, or by Intention and Design, either for Lucre of Gold, or for disburthening of the Countries sur charged with multitudes of Inhabitants, or by greatness of mind, affecting Noble Ʋn∣dertakings, or by Reason of Hardships, Oppres∣sion, and Warrs at home, or by some of all these wayes, several parts of this great Conti∣nent, at several times have been planted with Inhabitants, which through process of time, have multiplied unto these many Nations, and have forgot ther Original, and the Manners, Re∣ligions, and Customes of these People, from whom they descended in</HI> Asia, Europe, <HI>or</HI> Africa.</P>
<P><HI>His Judgement is,</HI> That the Countries in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> which with greatest probability, have first Peopled <HI>America</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/> appear to be the <HI>British,</HI> the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> the <HI>Tartars,</HI> or <HI>Scythians,</HI> the <HI>Phenicians, Carthaginians,</HI> or the <HI>Chineses; Not men∣tioning the late Migrations of the</HI> Spanish, French, Portuguize, Dutch, English, <HI>or</HI> Scottish.</P>
<P><HI>Doctor</HI> Powels <HI>relates,</HI> That <HI>anno</HI> 1170, <HI>Madoch</HI> one of the Sons of <HI>Owen Guineth,</HI> went over twice unto the Northern coast of <HI>America,</HI> and made there a <HI>British</HI> plan∣tation; <HI>This is at large prosecuted by</HI> Lae∣tius <HI>in his second Observation.</HI></P>
<P>Grotius <HI>hath some Observations touching the Migrations of the</HI> Norwegians. Laetius <HI>grants, that</HI> Iseland, <HI>and some part of</HI> Green-land, <HI>were planted by</HI> Ericus Rufus, <HI>anno</HI> 928. <HI>that probably from hence Collonies were brought over unto the Northern parts of</HI> Ameri∣ca, <HI>over the</HI> Fretum Anian, <HI>in respect of the easiness and shortness of that passage, from</HI> Nova Zembla, <HI>and the farthest</HI> North-east <HI>part of</HI> Tartary, <HI>over that narrow Sea, and partly by Reason of the congruitie of the Bar∣barous customs of the</HI> Americans <HI>and</HI> Scy∣thians.</P>
<P>Hornius <HI>thinks the Migration of the</HI> Phe∣nicians <HI>and</HI> Carthaginians, <HI>especially unto the</HI> South-east <HI>part of the continent of</HI> Ame∣rica,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/> <HI>as</HI> Mexico <HI>and</HI> Brasile, <HI>very probable upon many accompts,</HI> 1: <HI>Ʋpon the great skill and long practise of Navigation, and the mul∣titude of Shipping of the</HI> Phenicians <HI>and</HI> Car∣thaginians. 2: <HI>Ʋpon the Accommodation of the Port of</HI> Carthage, <HI>and other</HI> African <HI>ports bordering upon the</HI> Mediterranean Sea, <HI>to make their Voyages</HI> West-ward, <HI>and the great advantage of the constant</HI> Easterlie <HI>Windes which makes the Voyage to</HI> Mexico, <HI>and</HI> Brasile <HI>more easie.</HI> 3. <HI>Ʋpon some an∣cient Histories, intimating the progress of the</HI> Phenicians <HI>and</HI> Carthaginians <HI>Fleet unto some Islands, or Continents in or near the</HI> At∣lan ick Ocean.</P>
<P><HI>And lastlie, he findes much of the</HI> Origina∣tion of the Americans attribute to the Migration of the <HI>Seni</HI> or <HI>Sinenses</HI> from the <HI>Eastern</HI> parts of <HI>China,</HI> and the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, from the Islands of <HI>Borneo,</HI> and the <HI>Moluccas</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> through the <HI>Mare Pacificum,</HI> unto the <HI>Western</HI> parts of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> which tho it be a large Ocean of a∣bove 2000. Leagues betwixt the <HI>Philip∣pine</HI> Islands, and the West of the <HI>American</HI> Continent, and the passage hither dif∣ficult, in respect of the constant <HI>Easterly</HI> Windes betwixt the <HI>Tropicks;</HI> yet many
<PB N="11" REF="9"/> reasons appear to the liklyhood of a plan∣tation, from thence, 1: in respect of the Peopling of <HI>China,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Web,</HI> sayes, <HI>Was first Peopled after the Ʋniversal Deluge; Sem</HI> the son of <HI>Noah,</HI> first set∣tling here, it being the most ancient and primitive Language, that by means of the Antiquity and Settledness of this <HI>Mo∣narchie,</HI> having continued ever since the Universal Deluge: It is most probable, the <HI>Western</HI> continent of <HI>America</HI> was Peo∣pled hence. 2: Because they were the greatest Masters of Shipping, and best skilled in Navigation of any part in the World; The <HI>Pixis Nautica</HI> being there known, and used long before the know∣ledge thereof in <HI>Europe.</HI> 3. The many Islands upon the <HI>South,</HI> and <HI>South-east</HI> part of <HI>China,</HI> as <HI>Borneo, Javae, Gilolo, Ce∣lebes,</HI> and others near the <HI>Aequator</HI> are disjoyned, but by very narrow Seas, not much broader than between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> from the neck of Land, cal∣led <HI>Terra de Papes,</HI> or <HI>Nova Guinea,</HI> and <HI>Nova Hollandia</HI> new discovered; to be at least in some parts disjoyned from the more <HI>Southern Continent,</HI> by a great Sea, but anciently thought to have been a

It is most certain that from the first Planting of Religion among Men, it hath alwayes held a constant way from East to West, and hath in that Line pro∣ceeded so far, that it hath extended to the uttermost Western bounds <HI>of the for∣merly known World, so that if it make up any further passage upon that point of the Compass, it must necessarly light upon the</HI> West-Indies, <HI>And it is conceived with all, that our Saviors Prophesie,</HI> Matth. 24.27. <HI>points out such a progress of the Gospel, its true that the compa∣rison there used, taken from the</HI> lightning, <HI>aims at the sudden dispersing of the knowledge of CHRIST by the Apostles Ministery but
<PB N="32" REF="20"/> whereas it is known, that the</HI> Ligthning shins from diverse places of the Heaven, <HI>shew∣ing it self indifferently, sometimes in the</HI> West, <HI>sometimes in the</HI> North <HI>or</HI> South; <HI>Its judged probable that our</HI> Saviour <HI>does in this simili∣tude, choice to name the</HI> lightning that comes out of the East unto the West, <HI>to express not only the</HI> shining out of the Gospel, <HI>but withall the</HI> way <HI>and</HI> passage <HI>by which it pro∣ceeds from one end of the World to an other, that is from</HI> East <HI>to</HI> West.</P>
<P><HI>But passing by that onely as a probable ar∣gument, the following seems to carry greater weight, the knowledge of CHRIST must cer∣tainly be manifested to all quarters of the World, according to diverse predictions of Pro∣phets ratified and renewed by</HI> Christ <HI>and his Apostles; but that the knowledge of</HI> Christ <HI>hath been never as yet fully discovered to these</HI> Western Nations <HI>is clearly demonstrated, se∣ing till the time that the first Planters went over from</HI> England, <HI>not many years since, no Historie for</HI> 500. <HI>years before</HI> Christ, <HI>ever mentioned any such Inhabitants upon earth; much less l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft any record of passage to them or com∣merce with them; so that unless we should conceive a miraculous worth of conceiving know∣ledge without means, it cannot be imagined,
<PB N="33" REF="20"/> how these Nations should have once heard of the</HI> Name of CHRIST?</P>
<P><HI>But further▪ what shall we think of that almost miraculous opening the passage unto, and discovery of these formerly</HI> unknown Nations, <HI>which must needs have proven impossible to</HI> former Ages, for want of the Knowledge of the use of the Load-stone, <HI>as wounderfully found out as these</HI> unknown Countreys <HI>by it. It were little less then im∣piety to conceive,</HI> that GOD, whose Will concurrs with the lighting of a Sparrow upon the ground, <HI>had no designe in di∣recting one of the most</HI> difficult and observ∣able works of this Age, <HI>and as great folly to imagine,</HI> that He who made all things, <HI>and consequently,</HI> Orders and Directs them to his own Glory, had no other scope, but the satisfying of Mens greedy appe∣tites, who thirsted after the riches of that new World; <HI>And to tender to the bloody and cruel</HI> Spainard <HI>the objects of such</HI> barba∣rous cruelties, <HI>as the World never heard of. We have then ground to conceive,</HI> that GOD in that great Discovery, <HI>aimed at this,</HI> that after he had punished the Atheism and Idolatry of these Heathens, and brutish Nations by the Conquerours
<PB N="34" REF="21"/> cruelty; <HI>and acquainted them by</HI> mixture <HI>with some other</HI> peoples civility, he <HI>might at length</HI> cause the Glorious Gospel of JESUS CHRIST shine out to them as it did to other Nations, after the sharp times of the bitter dissolations thereof be∣twixt the <HI>Romans</HI> and them. <HI>That this</HI> Nation <HI>is able and fit to send out</HI> Collonies <HI>unto</HI> forraign parts <HI>will evidently appear to any who considers our overflowing multituds, this being admitted for a received principle, that</HI> Countries superabound in people, when they have mo then they can well imploy, <HI>seeing we know men are not ordain∣ed to</HI> live only, <HI>but withall and specially to</HI> serve one another, <HI>throw love in some pro∣fitable and useful calling; and tho it be grant∣ed,</HI> that this Land by GODS ordinary blessing yeelds sufficiencie of Corn and Cattle, for moe then the present inhabi∣tants; <HI>yet that we have moe people, then we do or can profitably imploy, will appear to any man of understanding, willing to acknowledge the truth, and to consider that many among us live</HI> without imployment <HI>either wholly or in the greatest part.</HI></P>

Or, what warrand particular men have to engadge their Persons, and Estates, in this imployment of planting Collonies.</P>
<P><HI>As for he first of these, we find we may remove for the gaining of knowledge, our</HI> Saviour commends it in the Queen of the South, that she came from the
<PB N="36" REF="22"/> uttermost ends of the Earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon, Matth. 12.24. <HI>And surely with him she might have continued for the same end, if her Personal Calling had not recalled her home. We find it also allowable to remove, and travel for</HI> Merchandise, <HI>and</HI> Gain-sake; Daily Bread may be sought from a farr, Prov. 31.14: <HI>Yea, our</HI> Savi∣our approveth travel for Merchants, Matth. 13.45. <HI>when He compareth a</HI> Chri∣stian to a Merchant man seeking Pearls; <HI>for he never fetcheth a Comparison from any unlawful thing, to illustrate a thing Lawful; the comparison from the</HI> unjust Steward, <HI>and from the</HI> Thief in the night, <HI>not being taken from the</HI> unjustice of the one, <HI>or the</HI> Theft of the other, <HI>but from the</HI> Wisdom of the one, <HI>and the</HI> suddenness of the other, <HI>which in themselves are not unlawful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We find from</HI> Scripture, <HI>its lawful to</HI> re∣move to plant a Collonie, <HI>that is,</HI> a Com∣pany agreeing together to remove out of their own Countrey, and settle a City or Common Wealth elsewhere; <HI>of such a Collony (as is already mentioned) we read in</HI> Acts 16.12. which GOD blessed and prospered exceedingly, and made of it a glorious Church. <HI>Nature teacheth</HI> Bees <HI>to
<PB N="37" REF="22"/> do so, when as the Hyve is too full, they seek abroad for new dwellings; so when the Hyve of a Kingdom is so full, that</HI> Tradesmen <HI>cannot live one by another, but eat up one an∣other, in this case its lawful to remove.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But further, GOD alloweth a Man to re∣move, when he may imploy his</HI> Talents <HI>and</HI> Gifts <HI>better elsewhere, especially when he is not</HI> bound by any particular ingadge∣ment to the place where he is; <HI>thus GOD sent</HI> Joseph before to preserve the Church, Josephs <HI>Wisdom and Spirit was not fit for a</HI> Shepherd, <HI>but for a</HI> Counsellour of State, <HI>and therefore GOD sent him to</HI> Egypt.</P>
<P><HI>Where people find themselves straitned in point of their opinion, no reasonable man will question their call to go, whereby Law they are allowed that Freedom, in this point which they themselves would desire; this is one great incouragement to any so circumstantial, to re∣move to any of the new Plantations; the in∣terest of which oblidgeth to lay this as a fun∣damentall, that no man shall be any way im∣posed upon in matters of principls, but have their own freedom without the least hazard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It will certainly be allowed by all that in the present circumstances of the</HI> Protestants <HI>in</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="23"/> France, <HI>where the free exercise of their</HI> Reli∣gion <HI>is denyed to them, it is very allowable for them to remove where without hazard they may live in the free exercise of their own prin∣ciples, being upon that accompt obnoxious to no hazard as guilty of the breach of the Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I believe some may object,</HI> that no man undertakes this task without an extraor∣dinary warrand, such as <HI>Abraham</HI> had from GOD, to call him out of Mesopo∣tamia to Canaan; <HI>their opinion appears to be founded upon this argument, that the</HI> plan∣ting of Collonies is an extraordinary work; and therefore these who under∣take it, must have an extraordinary call. <HI>In answer to this, I think it cannot be granted, that the planting of Collonies is an extraordina∣ry work this argument lying strongly against it.</HI></P>
<Q><P>That duty which is commanded by a perpetual law, cannot be accomp∣ted extraordinary.</P>
<P>But the sending out of Collonies is com∣manded by a perpetual Law.</P>
<P>Therefore it is no extraordinary duty.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Now that the</HI> commandment is perpe∣tual,
<PB N="39" REF="23"/> <HI>hath been proved, first, because it was</HI> given to Mankind. 2. <HI>Because it hath a</HI> ground <HI>which is</HI> perpetual, <HI>to wit,</HI> the emptiness of the earth, <HI>which either is so, or may be so, while the World endures, for even these places which are full, may be emp∣tied by</HI> Wars, <HI>or</HI> sickness, <HI>and then an argu∣ment passeth as strongly the contrary way, the undertaking of an</HI> ordinar duty <HI>needs no o∣ther then an</HI> ordinary warrant, <HI>but such is planting of a Collonie as being undertaken by Vertue of a</HI> perpetual Law, <HI>therefore the undertaking to</HI> plant a collonie <HI>needs no ex∣traordinary warrant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I must grant</HI> Abrahams <HI>undertaking was in many things extraordinar, and therefore need∣ed an</HI> immediat direction from GOD, <HI>he was to go alone with his Family and Brethren, to such a certain place far distant, possest already by the</HI> Canaanits <HI>who were to be expelled, that land was to be wholly appropriat to him∣self and his Issue, he was not to plant it at present, but only to Sojourn in it, and walk thorow it</HI> for a time; <HI>Now none of these circumstances fit our ordinary collonies; &amp; conse∣quently</HI> Abrahams <HI>example is nothing to this
<PB N="40" REF="24"/> purpose, because the case is different, tho in some other things alike.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It may be further objected,</HI> that tho Men may adventure upon the Work, upon an ordinary Warrant, yet none can give that but the State; therefore it may be judged that a Command from the <HI>High∣est Authority</HI> unto such as ingadge them∣selves in this Affair is necessary; That the State hath power over all her Mem∣bers to command and dispose of them within the bounds of Justice; <HI>is more evi∣dent then can be denyed; but this power is di∣versly executed, sometimes by</HI> Command, <HI>sometimes by</HI> Permission, <HI>as in preparations to Warr; sometimes Men are compelled to serve, sometimes they are permitted to go Volunteers; sometimes the</HI> Supream Power <HI>takes care of the whole business; sometimes as in</HI> Musters <HI>commits it to</HI> Delegats. <HI>If the</HI> Govern∣ment <HI>then proclaim</HI> Liberty <HI>to such as will go about such a design, and</HI> commit the care to themselves, to associat whom they think fit. <HI>It cannot be denyed, but the State hath given a</HI> sufficient Warrand, <HI>as will ap∣pear by your perusal of the</HI> Advertisement <HI>published thereanent, adjoyned to the close here∣of.</HI></P>
<PB N="41" REF="24"/>
<P><HI>Neither does it appear that any State did more; the</HI> Romans <HI>use was to proclaim,</HI> That they intended to plant a Collonie of such a number in such a place, and as many as would give in their names, should receive so many Acres of ground, and enjoy such other priviledges as they thought fit to grant them; <HI>which they then expressed, these who gave in their names were enrolled till the number was full: and then they had certain Commissioners appointed; to see all things ordered accordingly, and every Man put in possession of his Inheritance; Nei∣ther did the State interpose their Authority, in assigning and choising out the Men, but left it free and voluntar to every Man to take or leave, seing nothing can bear out the Hazards and inconveniencies of such undertakings,</HI> but a willing mind; <HI>Men can disjeast any thing which themselves do choice or desire, but a Commandment makes a pleasant thing harsh; how much more harsh things intollerable!</HI></P>
<P><HI>By what is above written, I apprehend you will find it sufficiently cleared, that the</HI> pro∣secuting this Design is warranted from the Word of GOD; <HI>it remains for your further satisfaction, as to the reasonableness thereof, to be made no less apparent, that the</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="25"/> effectual carrying on thereof will contri∣bute to the advantage of the Nation in general, and to the honour and particu∣lar interest of these who are active Un∣dertakers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herein; <HI>and I am much in a mis∣take, if I make not that appear as clearly as the other, but before</HI> I <HI>begin to condescend upon particulars, I judge you will not find it im∣proper in the first place, to offer to your consi∣deration, a general Survey of the present cir∣eumstances of the Nation, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you will the more easily be satisfied of some particulars properly to be noticed, for your more clear con∣viction of the truth of this assertion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tho there be some particular parcels of</HI> Our Countrey <HI>here and there to be found, which both for the</HI> nature of the Soil, <HI>and other pleasant and agreeable accommodations are in themselves sufficiently desirable, yet where I have the general prospect thereof in my view, I find my self oblidged to acknowledge, it is not among the most</HI> fertile places of the world, <HI>to say no worse, but tho we cannot com∣pate with</HI> Our Neighbour Nation, <HI>as to the fertility of the Soil in general, or the flou∣rishing of trade; in some things it will be ac∣knowledged we are comparativly nothing infe∣riour to them, this kingdom hath plenty of Inha∣bitants,

<P><HI>Sir, you may easily consider, what an interest</HI> Scotland <HI>might have had in</HI> Ameri∣ca, <HI>had all these who have gone from their na∣tive Countrey in queast of Honor and Fortunes, to these places, steered their course to this Airth; there is hardly any noble family in</HI> Scot∣land, <HI>or Gentlemen of any note, but ere this time

<P><HI>It is on the other hand sufficiently known to all, who are in the least acquainted with</HI> Our Scottish Histories, <HI>That,</HI> Our Gentry who have ordinarly the advantage of Educa∣tion, whereof our Commonality are de∣prived, are in nothing inferior to any Gentry in Europe; <HI>by this I mean not only</HI>

<P><HI>And to conuclude you will find no smal ground of further incouragement to such as are resolved effectually to bestirr themselves in carrying on this</HI> design, <HI>from the consideration of the great success of the only undertaking of this Nature this Kingdom was ever concerned in, whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s made clearly evident that we want not peo∣ple for managing such</HI> design, <HI>it was but a∣bout the latter end of</HI> King James the sixth,
<PB N="51" REF="29"/> <HI>his dayes, that we began to be concerned in sending some people to</HI> Ireland, <HI>and yet the small beginning that design had, from the un∣dertaking of a very few</HI> Gentlemen, <HI>hath come this length that I am informed by</HI> Credi∣table Authors, that Kingdom this day could bring to the fields an hundred thou∣sand of our countrey men; <HI>Yea, I had an accompt thence lately from an</HI> acquaintance <HI>of mine, who was serious in advancing this de∣sign, That the</HI> Province of Ulster, where most of our Nation are seated, could spare Fourty thousand Men and Wo∣men, to an <HI>America</HI> Plantation, and be sufficiently Peopled it self. <HI>The Gentle∣man who gave me this Information, is since setled in</HI> Mary-land, <HI>the accompt he sends of that Countrey is so encouraging, that I hear a great many of his Acquaintances are making for that Voyage; one thing is considerable in this to be observed,</HI> That the difficulties of such an undertaking were far more ter∣rifying at that time, then now to our Countrey Men, seing a Voyage from the <HI>West of Scotland</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> not 16. hours sailing, was then more formidable gene∣rally to People, who otherwise would have undertaken willingly the Voyage,
<PB N="52" REF="30"/> then now from <HI>Lieth</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> whe∣ther several Ships have gone without the least discouraging accident.</P>
<P><HI>But now to come to the Answer of your most ma∣terial Question, to wit,</HI> What I judge the <HI>most</HI> proper place in <HI>America,</HI> for a seat to these who would resolve to go hence upon such a Design <HI>For your satisfaction in this, I shall very freely, tell you my own Opinion, that hav∣ing for some time made it my work to consider all the</HI> Coast <HI>of</HI> America, <HI>from the River of</HI> Canada, Northerly, <HI>to the River of</HI> May, Southerly, <HI>in that part of</HI> Flonda <HI>now cal∣led</HI> Caralina; <HI>having in my search had the opportunity of informing my self of the different nature of the Soils, the temperature of the Climats, the healthfulness of the places, the Constitutions of the several Governments, the conveniences of Access, the advice given to</HI> Phaeton, <HI>appears very apposite,</HI> medio tutis∣simus ibis, <HI>and so</HI> East-Jersey, <HI>upon the Ri∣ver of</HI> Hudson, <HI>is the place I find my self ob∣lidge to preferr to any other of the</HI> English <HI>Plantations upon that coast, upon some or other if not most of the above named considera∣tions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That you may be convinced of the truth of this, I here send you what discription I have
<PB N="53" REF="30"/> of that place, as it is narrated in a Treatise thereanent, emitted lately by the</HI> Scots Pro∣prieters; <HI>I send you also the doubles of several letters from thence all agreeing in one, to the advantage of that place, confirming all spoken in the said Treatise, after your perusal of what does follow, you will see whether I have ground or not to make this choise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is time now to show how some of our Countrey-men, in order to so advantagious a Project, have already purchased an considerable Interest in a Plantation, which is justly e∣steemed not Inferiour, if not beyond any place, upon the whole continent of</HI> America, <HI>belong∣ing to the</HI> English <HI>Dominions, called</HI> East-New-Jersey. <HI>The deduction of the right of it is thus;</HI></P>
<P><HI>The KING by Patent to the Duke of</HI> York <HI>granted a great tract of Land lying betwixt</HI> Virginia <HI>and</HI> New-England, <HI>It was for∣merly in the hand of the</HI> Dutch, <HI>and conside∣rably improved by them, and called</HI> New-Ne∣therlands, <HI>And by treaty after the first</HI> Dutch <HI>Wars, Surrendered to the King that part of it, lying betwixt</HI> Delaware <HI>and</HI> Hudsons River, <HI>called</HI> New-Cesaria, <HI>or</HI> New-Jer∣sey; <HI>which is betwixt the</HI> 39. <HI>and</HI> 41. <HI>De∣gree of</HI> Northern Latitude: <HI>was by the</HI>

<PB N="65" REF="36" MS="y"/> Witness our self, at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the 29. day of <HI>June,</HI> in the 16. Year of Our Reign.</P>
<P><HI>The SCOTS Proprietors are the Earl of</HI> Perth, <HI>Lord High Chancellour of</HI> SCOT∣LAND, <HI>his Brother, the Viscount of</HI> Met∣foord, <HI>Secretar of State for this Kingdom, and the Viscount of</HI> Tarbit, <HI>Lord Register,</HI> Five hundred thousand Acres, <HI>being seven parts of the</HI> 24. <HI>belongs to these three, and some other Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Province or Collony lyes betwixt</HI> 39. <HI>and</HI> 41. <HI>Degrees of Latitude, being about</HI> 12. <HI>Degrees more to the</HI> South, <HI>then the</HI> City of London. <HI>It is in the same Climate with the Kingdom of</HI> Naples, <HI>and</HI> Montpelier <HI>in</HI> France. <HI>The Summer is hotter, and longer then in</HI> England, <HI>and the Winter colder and shorter, the dayes about an hour longer in Win∣ter, and as much shorter in Summer. Is bounded</HI> South-East <HI>with the Maine Sea,</HI> East <HI>by that vast Navigable Stream, called</HI> Hud∣sons <HI>River, which divides this from the Pro∣vince of</HI> New-York, West <HI>by a Line of Division, which separates this Province from</HI> West-Jersey, <HI>and</HI> North <HI>upon the Maine-Land. And extends it self in length upon the Sea-coast and alongst</HI> Hudsons River, <HI>one
<PB N="66" REF="37"/> hundred</HI> English <HI>myles and upward.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The scituation of this Countrey is just, as it were, in the Center of the</HI> English plantati∣ons <HI>in</HI> America, <HI>betwixt the South parts of</HI> Carolina, <HI>which is over hot; and the North parts of</HI> Pemaquitte, <HI>next</HI> New Scot∣land <HI>which are coldest; so that its convenien∣cie of scituation, temperature of the Aire, and fertility of the Soyl is such, that there is no less then seven Towns considerable already,</HI> (viz.) Shretsburry, Midletonn, Berg∣hen, New-wark, Elizabeth-town, Woobridge, <HI>and</HI> Piscataway, <HI>which are well inhabited by a sober and industruous peo∣ple, who have necessary provisions for them∣selves and families, and for the comfortable entertainment of Travellers and Strangers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And the Quit-rents, or Fewes (as they are called) of these Towns and other plantations, already in the Countrey, yeelds to the</HI> 24 <HI>Pro∣prietors above</HI> 500. lib. sterling, <HI>yearly Re∣venue, and the Air of this Collony, is experi∣mentallie found generally to agree well with</HI> English <HI>Constitutions, and consequently with Ours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For Navigation it hath these advantages, not onely to be scituate along the Navigable
<PB N="67" REF="37" MS="y"/> parts of</HI> Hudsons River, <HI>but lyes also fiftie myles along the Main Sea, and near the midest of this Province is that notted Bay for ships within</HI> Sandy-Hook, <HI>very well known, not to be inferiour to any Harbour in</HI> Ameri∣ca, <HI>where ships not only harbour in greatest storms, but there Ride safe with all Winds, and sail in and out thence as well in</HI> Winter <HI>as</HI> Summer. <HI>For Fishery the Sea-banks are very well stored with variety of Fishes, not only such as are profitable for Exportation, but such as are fit for Food there; There are</HI> Whales, Coad-fish, Colling, <HI>and</HI> Hake-fish, <HI>and large</HI> Mackeril, <HI>and also many other sorts of smal</HI> Flate-fish; <HI>The Bay, also, and</HI> Hudsons River, <HI>are plentifully stored with</HI> Sturgeon, <HI>and other</HI> Scal-fish, Eills, <HI>and</HI> Shel-fish, <HI>as</HI> Oysters, <HI>in abundance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Countrey is also plentifully, supplied with Lively-springs,</HI> Rivolets, Inland-Ri∣vers, <HI>and</HI> creeks, <HI>which fall into the Sea, and</HI> Hudsons-River, <HI>in which also there is varietie of Fresh-fish, and water Fowl.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There are little hills from</HI> Rariton-River, <HI>which is about the middle of this Province, that go to the verie</HI> North-West-bounds <HI>of
<PB N="68" REF="38"/> it, in which are aboundance of good Mill-Stons to be had, and there is many, both</HI> Corn, <HI>and Saw-milnes set, and setting up already, also on the other side of these Mountains, there is brave fresh</HI> Rivolets, <HI>fit for setting of</HI> In-Land-Towns, <HI>and a great deal of Meadow-ground upon the banks thereof, So that there is abun∣dance of Hay to be had for Fodering of Cattle in the Winter time, and these Meadows shows the Countrey is not altogether covered with timber.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Its true, the first difficulty meets People in Planting there, is the cutting down Wood (Tho having some Meadow intermixt already well covered with Hay, is a great ease) yet the trouble is compensed by the advantage, which the timber being cut down, yeelds, being good Oake, fit for Shipping and Masts; and also Chesmite. Walnut, Poplar, Cdar, Ash, Fir; And also, by the fertility of the Soyl, being cleared, which yeelds a vast increase not only of</HI> Indean <HI>Corn, which is a very wholsome Food, but of</HI> English <HI>grain, as Wheat and Barley, where∣of it usually yeelds betwixt the</HI> 20. <HI>and</HI> 30th. <HI>fold, and with far less labour (the timber be∣ing once removed) then in</HI> Britan. <HI>And to show the labour of the cutting down the Trees, and clearing the ground, is not so great as
<PB N="69" REF="38"/> some may Imagine; It is known by experience, that two men arriving there in</HI> September, <HI>or</HI> October, <HI>may clear as much ground, as usually brings by Harvest following twenty Quarters, that is ahout</HI> 40. Scots Bolls <HI>of grain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Countrey also, produceth good Flax, and Hemp, which they now spine, and Manu∣facture into Linnen Cloath, &amp; the very Barrens there (as they are called) are not like most in</HI> Britain, <HI>but produceth Grass fit for Graz∣ing Cattle in Summer time; There is also u∣pon Ground (already cleared) store of good</HI> English Claver Grass <HI>growing; the Countrey is well stored with wild Deir; Connies, and wild Fowl of several sorts; As Turkeys, Pigeons, Partridges, Plevers, Quaills, wild Swans, and Geese, Ducks in great plenty; It produceth variety of good and delicious Fruits; as Grapes, Plumes, Mulberries, and also Appricocks, Peaches, Pears, Apples, Quin∣ches, Water Millons; which are in</HI> England <HI>planted in Orchards and Gardens; but grow there with fare less labour; and many more Fruits, which come not to perfection in</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>are the more natural product of this Countrey. It is thought Olives would grow well there; and being store of
<PB N="70" REF="39"/> Mulberrie Trees, Silk-worms would do well there; for they were tryed in</HI> Virginia, <HI>and proved very well, if the laziness of the Peo∣ple, and there being wholly set upon Tobacco, and the Interest of Merchants, who were a∣fraid it might spoil their Silk-Trade from the</HI> Straits, <HI>had not hindered.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To shew how Fruit-Trees do advance in that Countrey, it is credibly reported, that about</HI> Burlingtoun, in West Jersey, <HI>which is</HI> Northernly <HI>then the greatest part of this Pro∣vince, from an Apple-tree-Seed in four years, (without grafting) there sprung a tree, that in the fourth year bore such a quaintitie of Apples, as yeelded a barrell of Syder.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is there also, great store of Horses, Cowes, Hoggs, and some sheep, which may be bought at reasonable prices with</HI> English, <HI>money, or</HI> English <HI>Commodities, or mans labour; where goods and money are wanting.</HI></P>

<P><HI>By this</HI> Constitution of Government <HI>by the Lord</HI> Barclay, <HI>and Sir</HI> George Cart∣wright, <HI>such provision is made both for</HI> Li∣berty of Religion, <HI>and</HI> Property, <HI>that the</HI> Province <HI>hath been considerably peopled; many resorting thither from the</HI> Neighboring Collonies, <HI>beside what have gone from</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>and this Kingdom, within this few years, so that the planters are able to</HI> mu∣ster 600 well Armed Men.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Proprietors <HI>have framed a new</HI> Schem of Government, <HI>which is not yet fully concluded on, but it is intended rather to be an enlarging; than an abbreviating of the former, and making more easie, and advantagious for the</HI> Inhabitants, <HI>the chief parts of it are.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the</HI> 24. Proprietors <HI>shall chuse a</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="55"/> Governour, 16. <HI>of them has a Conclusive Vote in it, after the death of him now chosen, he shall continue but for</HI> 3 <HI>years, and be lyable to the</HI> Censure of the Proprietors, and great Council, <HI>and punishable if he trans∣gress, There is a</HI> great Council <HI>to meet once a year (and sit, if they see meet, for</HI> three Moneths) <HI>consisting of the</HI> 24.

<P><HI>To aviod</HI> Lording over one another, <HI>No Man can purchase above the</HI> 24th. <HI>part of the Countrey; And on the other hand, least any should squander away their Interest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd yet re∣tain the</HI> character of the Government, <HI>that belongs to</HI> Property, <HI>and thence be cap∣able to betray it, as not being bound by Interest,

<P>Libertie <HI>in matters of</HI> Religion <HI>is esta∣blished in the fullest manner. To be a</HI> Planter <HI>or</HI> Inhabitant, <HI>nothing is more required but</HI> the acknowledging of One Almighty GOD, and to have a Share in the Go∣vernment, A simple profession of faith of Jesus Christ, without descending into any other of the differences among Chri∣stians, only that Religion may not be a cloak for disturbance, who ever comes into the Magistrature, must declare,
<PB N="104" REF="56"/> they hold not themselves in conscience obliged, for Religions sake, to make an alteration, or to endeavour to turn out their partners, in the Government, because they differ in Opinion from them, <HI>and this is no more then to follow that great Rule,</HI> To do as they would be done by.</P>
<P><HI>These are the</HI> Fundamentals, <HI>which are not alterable by any Act of the great</HI> Council, <HI>as other things, by the voices</HI> of 2 thirds, <HI>but only by an universal agreement; so it is hoped, that this hint will satisfie all sober and understanding people, what Encouragement such a Government may give.</HI></P>

Acres, <HI>confirmed to them, and their heirs for ever, paying half a Crown an</HI> Acre, <HI>never to be raised upon them: And
<PB N="105" REF="56"/> for the Charge of the first year, they may easily Calculate, carrying over as much</HI> Oat-meal, <HI>as will serve them</HI> Bread, <HI>and the fraught will be inconsiderable, and they will get flesh enough in the Countrey for killing, without charge, and will be able to clear more ground the first winter, then will▪ double serve their Families after the first harvest, so that they will only have to buy with the Commodities they carry over with them, Seed, and Beasts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Charge of</HI> transportation, <HI>is, for every</HI> Man or Woman 5. <HI>lib. starling, pas∣sage and intertainment, for</HI> children un∣der 10. years of age, 50. shilling, <HI>and</HI> Sucking children nothing, 40. shillings for the tunn of goods, <HI>and often under.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Voyage is judged lesse</HI> Sea hazard <HI>then either to</HI> Holland, <HI>or</HI> London, <HI>and if there be any tollerable winds, it is easily made in</HI> 6. <HI>weeks, There went a ship last harvest to</HI> West Jersey, <HI>from the Road of</HI> Aberden: <HI>and they came to</HI> Delaware-River-mouth <HI>in</HI> 8. <HI>weeks, though they had great Calmes, and of betwixt</HI> 30. <HI>and</HI> 40. <HI>Passengers that went out of</HI> Aberdeen <HI>several</HI> women, <HI>and</HI> children, <HI>not above</HI> 4. <HI>of them had been at Sea before, not one dyed, nor was sick</HI> by the way.</P>

Acres to them and theirs for ever, paying 2. pence an Acre, as much Corn as will sow an Acre, and a Sute of now cloaths; Now, <HI>Considering that there is</HI> 5. pound Sterling payed <HI>for their Passage, this is good termes; and that after the terme of their Service is expired, they will gain more in one year there, then they can do in two at home, towards the gaining of a Stock to their land, and it may be easily conceived that they will be well treated by their Masters, since it is their Interest to do so there more then here, for that they would be Considerable Lo∣sers, either by their Death, or sicknesse, be∣ing out so great an advance for them, if, by any hard-ship, they shall be disabled to serve out their times.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All Sorts of Tradesmen may make a brave</HI> Livelyhood <HI>there, such as</HI> Carpenters, Ship-wrights, Rope-makers, Smiths, Brick-makers, Taylors, Tanners, Cow∣pers, Mill-wrights, Joyners; Shooe∣makers, &amp;c. <HI>and any such like, who are

Acres, 2. pence the Acre, <HI>as much Corn as well</HI> sow 2. A∣cres, a cow and a Sow: <HI>And for the in∣couragement of any such Trasdmen, who are willing to go over and transport themselves, they shall have the like quantitie of Land, at the same rent, and the</HI> Proprietors <HI>will ob∣lidge themselves to find them work for a year, after their arryval, at as good Rates as they can have here, untill they furnish themselves with some Stock to make better advantage up∣on the</HI> Place.</P>
<P><HI>We will not encourage any to go there in ex∣pectation of</HI> Gold and Silver mines; <HI>yea, tho there were such in the Countrey, we should not be curious nor industrous to seek them out: being besides the Toyl, and Labour, but oc∣casions envy, and Emulation: Nor yet is their</HI> Suggar or Indigo <HI>there, or</HI> Cotton, <HI>nor any store of</HI> Tobacco, <HI>tho it grows there very well. But We consider it not our in∣terest to imploy much ground on it; The</HI> Riches <HI>of this Countrey Consists in that which is most Substantial and necessar for the use of men,</HI> to wit, <HI>Plenty of Corn and Cattle (and they have
<PB N="108" REF="58"/> besides Vines, and Fruits in abundance, as be∣fore has been said) so that who dwell here, need not to be oblidged to any other</HI> Plantati∣on, for any thing necessar for Life; <HI>and all other Plantations are beholden to them for necessaries, without which, their other Curiosities would little avail them: This with the Province of</HI> New-York, <HI>being the</HI> Granary <HI>or</HI> Store-house <HI>of the</HI> West-In∣dies, <HI>without which</HI> Barbadoes <HI>and the</HI> Lee∣wards Islands▪ <HI>could not subsist; Yea,</HI> New-England <HI>is forced to come there every year for Corn, this, with the advantage of Fishe∣ry, being considered, will easily induce Sober and industrious People, to prefer a Plantation here to most other places.</HI></P>

<PB N="127" REF="68"/> affair, to wit, the perusal of the follow∣ing Letters from that place: which I have been at great pains to collect for my own satisfaction in the particular. Yea, I have been so much upon my guard that I might not be imposed upon in this, that I have my self seen the principals of many of them, when you consider they come from several hands, at several times from People of Different perswa∣sions, and yet not the least contradicti∣on to be observed, amongst them all; and that the accompt given therein to the Generall Advantage of the Countrey, is homelogat by severall Gentlemen and Merchants, in this city, who to my self have Declared, they have been eye witnesses to the truth of the most materi∣all Passages in these accompts, narrated to the advantage of the place, I hope you will, find your self oblidged to rest Satisfied therewith.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear B. G.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO be as particular in my return, were but thy due, yet I cannot promise so much, However I may give thee some general account of the Province, and of our satisfaction with our present Lot, the short time I have experienced this.</P>
<P>But to give thee also, as thou desires a Character of <HI>Pensalvania</HI> and <HI>West-Jersey;</HI> that will be a task I must be excused to undertake, least I give offence, or at least bring me under censure as partial: Were

<PB N="148" REF="79"/> and that manner of Land, the more health, and this was often answered me, when I have been making comparisons; I must tell thee, their Character in Print by all that reads it, here is said to be modest, and much more might have been said in its Commendation. We have one thing more particular to us, which the other want also: which is vast Oysters banks, which is Constant fresh Victuals during the winter to <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> as well as <HI>Indians;</HI> of these there are many all along our Coasts from that Sea as high as against <HI>New York,</HI> whence they come to fetch them, so we are sup∣plied with salt fish at our doors, or with∣in half a tydes passage, and fresh Fish in aboundance in every little brook, as <HI>Pearch, Trout, Ells, &amp;c.</HI> which we catch at our doors. Provisions here are very plentiful, and people generally well stockt with Cattle: <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Bur∣lingtoun</HI> hath hitherto been their Mer∣cat, Few or no Trading-Men being here in this Province, I believe it hath been very unhappily heretofore under an ill managed Government, and most of
<PB N="149" REF="79"/> the people who are such, who have been invited from the adjacent Collonies by that goodness of its Soill, and convenient Scituation, at <HI>Amboy</HI> we are now build∣ing some small houses of 30. foot long, and 18. foot breadth, fitting to enter∣tain Work-men, and such who will go and build larger, the stones lye exceed∣ing well and good up that <HI>Rariton River</HI> a Tydes passage, and <HI>Oyster-shells</HI> upon the point to make lyme withall, which will wonderfully accommodat us in building good houses cheap, warm for Winter, cool for Summer, and durable, covering for houses are Shingles, Oak, Chesnut and Cedar, we have plentiful here of all, the last endures a mans age if he live to be old; There is 5. or 6. Saw∣mills going up here this Spring, two at work already, which abates the price of boords half in half, and all other timber for building, for although tim∣ber coast nothing; yet workmanship by hand was <HI>London price,</HI> or near upon, or sometimes more, which these Mills a∣bate; we buy Oak and Chesnut boords no cheaper then last year; My habita∣tion with <HI>Samuell Groome</HI> is at <HI>Elizabeth
<PB N="150" REF="80"/> Town,</HI> and here we came first, it lyes on a fresh small river, with the tyde, Ships of 30. or 40. Tuns come before our doors, throughout this Town is good <HI>English</HI> grass and (bears) a very good burthen; we cannot call our habitation solitarie, for what with the publict employ I have little less companie at my house dayly then I had in <HI>George Yeard,</HI> although not so many pass by my doors. The people are general a sober professing people, Wise in their Generation, Courtious in their Behaviour, and Respectful to us in Office among them. As for the Tem∣perature of the Air, it is wonderfully scituated to the <HI>Humours of Mankind,</HI> the wind and weather rarely holding in one point, or one kind for ten dayes toge∣ther: It is a rare thing for a Vessel to be wind-bound for a week together, the wind seldom holding in a point more then 48. hours, &amp; in a short time we have weet and dry, warm and cold weather, which changes we often desire in <HI>England</HI> and look for before they come; Yet this Variation creats not cold, nor have we the tenth part of the cold as we have in <HI>England;</HI> I never had any since I came,
<PB N="151" REF="80" MS="y"/> and in the midst of Winter, and Frosts could endure it with less cloaths then in <HI>England,</HI> for generally I go with that same Cloaths I use to wear in Summer with you, but warm cloaths hurt not. I bless the LORD, I never had better health nor my Family, my Daughters are very well improved in that respect, and tell me, they would not change their place for <HI>George Yeard,</HI> nor would I; People here are generally settled, where the tyde reaches, and althoughs this is good Land and well Timbered and plentifully supplied with Salt-Marish, yet there is much better Land up higher on the River, where they may go up with small boats, where many now are settling, there's extraordinary Land, fresh Meadows overflowed in the Winter time, that produces multitudes of Win∣ter Corns, and its believed will end are 20, 30, or 50, years flowing without in∣tromission, and not decay; such Land there is at <HI>Sops</HI> on <HI>Hudsons River,</HI> which hath born Winter Corn about 20. years without help, and is as good as at first, and better. <HI>William Penn</HI> took a view of the Land this last moneth, when here,
<PB N="152" REF="81" MS="y"/> and said, he had never seen such before in his life: All the <HI>English Merchants,</HI> and many of the <HI>Dutch</HI> have taken, and are desirous to take up Plantations with us. Our Countrey here called <HI>Berghen</HI> is al∣most <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> at a town called <HI>Newark</HI> 7. or 8. miles hence is made great quan∣tities of Syder, exceeding any we can have from <HI>New-England,</HI> or <HI>Rood-Island,</HI> or <HI>Long-Island;</HI> I hope to make 20. or 30. Barrels out of our Orchard next year, as they have done who had it before me, for that, it must be as providence ordered: Upon our view and survey of <HI>Amboy-point</HI> we find extraordinary well scituate for a great Town or City, be∣yound expectation, at low water round about the point are Oysters; There are Oysters of two kinds, small as <HI>English,</HI> and others two or three morsells, ex∣ceeding good for roasting and stewing; The people say our Oysters are good and in season all Summer; The first of the third Moneth I eat of them at <HI>Amboy</HI> very good; The point is good lively Land, 10. some places 20. foot above the water mark, About it are several Coves with small Coasts may lay up Vessels as
<PB N="153" REF="81" MS="y"/> in a decke, besides great Ships of any burthen, may all ryde before the town Land-loked against all winds: There <HI>Rariton-River</HI> runs up, or rather down 50 (far larger,) some say 100. mylles for small boats. I saw several vines upon the point, which produces, as they say, good grapes in their Season, this Coun∣trie is very full of them, but being no present mother of profite, few regard them more then to pick them as they lay in their way when they are rype. We have store of Clamms esteemed much better then Oysters; one <HI>Festivals</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> feast with them, there are Shallops, but in no great plentie. Fish we have great store, as our relation set forth, but they are very good when catcht. (as the proverb is) I have se∣veral Barrels by me now, which are good for our Table, and for Sale. I brought a Sea-Net over with me which may turn to good account. Sea-Nets are good Merchandise here, mine cost me about 4. or 5. <HI>lib.</HI> and can have 20. <HI>lib.</HI> for it if I would sell it now; I may writ of many such matters in our Pro∣vince, which may invite persons here,
<PB N="154" REF="82"/> but so am resolved to conclude, knowing that in probability, there is not an In∣dustrious man, but by GODS blessing may not only have a comfortable, but plentifull supplie of all things necessary for this life, with the salutation of my true affection to all, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I rest thy af∣fectionat friend,</P>

<PB N="155" REF="82"/> I have spent a considerable time in mak∣ing discovery, I have not as yet had times to lay out much land for you, only about <HI>17.</HI> or <HI>18.</HI> thousand Acres in one tract, good upland near <HI>Elizabeth Town;</HI> I have now seen the tract of Land against (or nigh <HI>Amboy point</HI> for∣merly laid out by <HI>Vanquillian;</HI> it is on the West-side of a Creek called <HI>Chingeroces,</HI> a∣bout <HI>eight thousand Acres.</HI> And I intend shortly to lay as much or twice as much more to it; but first we must talk with the <HI>Natives</HI> about that, and other tracts of Land they are not yet paid for; The last day of this moneth is appointed to treat with several <HI>Indians</HI> to buy several exceeding good tracts nigh the head of <HI>Rariton.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth of the next Moneth is also appoin∣ted to treat with other <HI>Indians,</HI> to buy other tracts of choice Meadowing, and Ʋp-land that lyeth about <HI>12.</HI> or thirteen myles up into the Countrey, which I have seen; and when we have accomplished these two things, we shall he able to lay out for you much land; and when I have been up in the Countrey towards and at <HI>Barnagate,</HI> and agreed with the <HI>Indians</HI> thereabout, for such land as we may see occa∣sion to purchase (presently) in order to a setle∣ment
<PB N="156" REF="83" MS="y"/> there; for here are many both of <HI>New-England, New-York,</HI> and some parts of this Province, stands ready to sit down in that part of the Countrey, not only for the sake of the good Ʋp land and Meadows, which re∣port saith, is much thereabouts; but also for the sake of the <HI>Whale</HI> Trade, and other fishing trade, which is like to be there shortly. <HI>New-England Men,</HI> and others were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tampering with the <HI>Indians</HI> to have purchased there, be∣fore and since we came, but now they are out of hopes of coming in at that door; so now they make their Addresses to us, and would have us to purchase, and let them come in our Ten∣nents, otherwayes as we may agree. I intend to attempt these things, this fall I have not been much on the South side of <HI>Rariton,</HI> only upon some upland at severall places, and upon the tract of <HI>8.</HI> thousand <HI>3.</HI> hundreth and <HI>20.</HI> Acres of yours aforementioned; and also on the Meadowing that lyes on the southside of <HI>Ra∣riton</HI> above <HI>Amboy,</HI> a year or two since, purchased of the <HI>Indians</HI> in the name of <HI>Dam Cartwright,</HI> though it was never intended for her, nor for any Proprietor, but as it fell out, they quarrelled about disposing and shar∣ing thereof, so it is now without controversie yours: Now know that <HI>Rariton</HI> River is

<P>I Took up several dayes with Coun∣trey men and others, to view the Ground and Water, at last I pitch∣ed upon a place where a Ship of 300. Tun may ride safely within a plank length of the Shoar at low water, and joyning thereto is a peece of marish ground, about 12. pearch broad, and 20. pearch long, and high land on each side like our Keyes by <HI>London Bridge;</HI> this may be easie cut quit round for smal Vessels to come to the Key, and lye safe round this Island, I set out Lots, 1. Acre a peece,
<PB N="161" REF="85"/> <HI>viz.</HI> 4. pole at the Key, and 40. pole back∣ward, from thence along the river, near half a mile I lay'd out the like lotts ve∣ry pleasant for scituation where they can see the ships coming in the Bayes of <HI>Sandy-Hook;</HI> for near 20 miles the Ships may ride alongs by the Town as safe as at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> just at the point by the Town; <HI>Ra∣riton-River</HI> runs up the Countrey a great way, there boats of 40 tun may goe, and the River, by the Town goes to <HI>New-York, Hudsons-River Long Island, Staten Island,</HI> and so to <HI>New-England;</HI> there is no place in all <HI>England</HI> for Conveniency and plea∣sant scituation; There are 60 Lotts upon the River, and 40 backward between these and the River, and these backward have a highway 100 foot broad, where I have laid out a place for a mercat, with cross Streets from the River to the Mar∣ket where the Town-houses are to be built; when this was done I laid out 400 Acres to be divided in 48 parts, <HI>viz.</HI> 36 to each Proprietor, and those who have Lotts in the Town, I grant them half Lotts in this to pay for the Lotts in the Town, 20 pound or if a half Lott of 36 Acres
<PB N="162" REF="86"/> 40 pounds; I laid 400 Acres to ly untill the Proprietors agree to devyd it as people comes over; There is 16 Lotts taken up by the <HI>Scotish</HI> Proprietors, and 8 Lotts by the Proprietors that are here; There are 20 Lotts taken up in the Town by other People; I engadge all to build a house of 30 foot long, and 18 broad, and 18 foot high to the raising, to be finished within a year, To pay for laying out 40 shil: a Lot, and 4<HI> d per Annum,</HI> Quit-Rent there are several begun already to build, I have laid out between 40 and 50 Acres for the Go∣vernours house.

<PB N="163" REF="86"/> clearing ground to get Corn sowne, this spring, then came in a Boar privatly to <HI>Elizabeth Town</HI> the 12th. past next morn∣ing; I went to <HI>New-York</HI> to visit the Go∣vernour, stayed there two or three days; He was very kind and promised a fair correspondency, so I did not publish my Commission untill this day before the Council; They have been kind and cour∣teous: Now is the time to send over people for settling these. There is 30000 Acres of Land in several places belonging to Proprietors formerly taken up by <HI>Cartwright,</HI> so here is land enough. The <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>William Dorkwrans</HI> people coming now and settling, advance the Province more then it hath been advan∣ced these ten years. Therefore Proprie∣tors send over some Families and Servants; I shall presently set them out Land, and it well presently bring them in consider∣able profite in a few years here wants; nothing but people; There is not a poor body in all the Province, nor that wants; Here is abundance of Provision, Pork and Beef.

<PB N="170" REF="90"/> <HI>500.</HI> or <HI>1000.</HI> Acres upon a River side; but thou must send over some goods to stock it with∣all, I desire thee to encourage some of our Fri∣ends, especially the Proprietors to send over some servants to stock some Land, And when they have cleared it, if they have a mind to lett it, here are tennents to take it, and if they will sell it, here are also purchasers; there is one man since I came here sold his Plantati∣on for <HI>1500. lib.</HI> the whole was <HI>1600.</HI> or <HI>1800.</HI> Acres, whereof only <HI>120.</HI> Acres were cleared, upon which he had a house, Garden and Orchyard, and Barn planted; I know several men who lett cleared Land at <HI>6.</HI> shil <HI>8.</HI> pennies and at <HI>10.</HI> shil. the Acre yearlie rent, which is a good encouragement for sending over servants to plant; I write not this as idle story, but as things realy and truly are; I have sent for servants my self to setle a farme for if the Pro∣prietors will not do so, I see not what they can exect. The <HI>Scots</HI> have taken a right course, They have sent over many servants, and are likewayes sending more; They have likewayes sent over many poor Families, and given them a small stock, and these Families some for <HI>7.</HI> some for <HI>10</HI> years give the half of their increase to the Land-lord, except the milk, which the tennent hath to himself, I have set

<HEAD>A Letter from <HI>Gavin Laury</HI> to the <HI>Scots</HI> Proprietors of the same date.</HEAD>
<P>KNowing you do expect from us an account of this Countrey, we have for your encourage∣ment, and for the encouragement of all
<PB N="172" REF="91" MS="y"/> our Countrey Men who may be inclin∣able to come into this Countrey, given you this breef and true account of it, ac∣cording as we have seen and are credibly informed, for having seen little, yet save the Winter Season, we must writ what is to be seen in Summer, upon Information which we have just ground to believe to be true, because what we have seen al∣read in it (notwithstanding of all that we heard of it before we came) surpass our expectation in many things; the Aire in this Countrey is very wholesome, and though it alter suddenly sometimes be∣ing one day hot and another cold, yet people are not so subject to catch cold, or be distempered by it as in our Countrey of <HI>England;</HI> the land lyes for the most part pretty high, but on the River and Creek sides are many Meadows which lye low, of which the Countrey people getts their Hay, whereby their stocks are maintained in the Winter Season, Pro∣visions here are pentifull and cheap; There is Beef, Pork, Venision, Mutton, Foul and Fish, aboundance to be had at easie rates, and for drink they have good Beer, and Cyder, and these that are de∣sirous
<PB N="173" REF="91"/> may have Wine of several sorts, and other kinds of strong Liquor, so that we see little wanting here that a man can desire; and we are here sure that a sober and industrious People might make this a rich Countrey, and enrich themselves in it, especially poor people who are hard put to it to gain bread at home; notwithstanding of the excessive Labour, for we see that people here want nothing, &amp; yet there labour is very saml; they work not so hard by one half as the Husband men or Fermors in our Coun∣trey; and many of these who have setled here upwards of sixteen years, have lived upon the product of the Land; They cleared the first two years after they came (and cleared none since) which pro∣duced not only Corn to maintain their own Families, but to sell every year, and the encrease of their Bestial whereof they have good store of several Sorts, Cows, Oxen, Horses, Sheep, and Swine, yeelds them other provisions and to sell; besides, yet there be some more Indu∣strious among them who have continu∣ed clearing and Improving Land, and these have got Estates, and would not
<PB N="174" REF="92"/> sell their Plantations for several hundred pounds, we have late up a little way on the <HI>Rariton</HI> River, but could not go so far as we intended being prevented by Rainy weather, but so far as we went was very rich land, and yet that above it is said to be richer, a great deal of it is natu∣rally clear of wood; And which is not so, is easily cleared, the trees being but small and a good distance from one an∣other, so that the Land yet untaken up so far as we can understand, is easier to clear then that which is taken up; the Towns that are already seated, being seated in woodiest places, the Merchants in <HI>New-York</HI> both <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English</HI> have many of them taken up Land and setled Plantations in this Countrey, and seve∣rall from that Collony are desiring to come and take up land among us, though they might have land in their own Col∣lony without paying Quittrents; The wood here is not so hard to clear as ma∣ny think, they do not pull it up by the Roots, but them about a foot or more from the ground; and one man may cut down many in a day, four of our men the first day they began, cut down seven∣ty
<PB N="175" REF="92"/> the best Trees they could find fit for building; there are not many of great Trees, but straight and tale, and there be of many sorts, Oak, Walnut, Ches∣nut, Cedar, Popler, Gumtrees, Firrs, Pines, Birth and Beech, and other sorts which we remember not at present; there are many good Orchards of Fruit trees, and they make abundance of good Cy∣der, especially at one Town called <HI>New-wark,</HI> which is esteemed at <HI>New-York</HI> and other places where it is sold, beyond any that comes from <HI>New-England;</HI> there are Peaches, and Vines grow wild about the River sides, which in Season bears good Fruit, and Grapes, and there are Strawberries over all the Woods and many other kind of goods and Fruits, and at <HI>Amboy</HI> point and several other places there is abundance of brave Oy∣sters: There will be many houses built there quickly, for many have taken up lots and all that have taken are oblieged to built within a year; there is good en∣couragment for Tradsmen to come over, such as Carpentars, Massons and Brick-layers, for they build not only of Wood, but also of Stone and Brick, yet most
<PB N="176" REF="93" MS="y"/> of Countrey Houses are built of Wood, only Trees split and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up in end on the Ground, and Coverings to their Houses are mostly Shingles made of Oak, Chesnut and Cedar wood, which makes a very neat Covering, yet there are some Houses covered after the <HI>Dutch</HI> manner with pantikles; the Towns are all settled upon Rivers, where Vessels of 30, or 40, Tuns may come up to their doors, and the out plantations generally upon some Brooks or Rivelets which are as plenty here as in our own Countrey, and curious clear water, and in many places are good Spring walls; but in the Towns every man for the most part have a well diggd by his own hand: Among all the towns that are Setled here, there is none lyeth so convenient for trade as <HI>New-Perth,</HI> for Shipps of great burden may come up closs to the houses, and may come up any time in the Winter; There came a Ship of 300. tuns in there this winter, in the hardest frost we had, and lay hard by the town, so near that she was tyed to a tree: The Land here; brings furth most sorts of English grain, and great encrease, Wheat, Rye, Barly,
<PB N="177" REF="93"/> Oats and others sorts of grain, such as <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, which is very good and wholesome kind of Grain; and also Buck-Wheat, and those Corns are to be had at easie rates, either for money or for goods, and those that have not m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="right margin cropped or obscured" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦ney or goods may have abundance for their work.</P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>We shall now answer so far as we are capable, your <HI>Quarries</HI> sent over to us.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>To the first, we cannot positively answer to give an account of the whole length and breadth of the Province, But we are informed that it is a great deale broader then ye expected, for these that have travelled from the extent of our bounds on Hudsons-River straight over to the <HI>Delawar</HI>-River, say it is <HI>100.</HI> myles or up∣wards; we shall know that certainly after a while, for the Line betwixt us and <HI>New-York</HI> is to be run straight over to Dela∣ware-River, about <HI>3.</HI> weeks hence, and after that the Line betwixt us and <HI>West-Jersey,</HI> After which we shall be able to give a true ac∣count of the bounds of that Province.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="178" REF="94"/>2ly. When the bounds is so exactly laid out we can the easier guess at the Number of Acres, and by that time may be able to give an account what number of Acres is already ta∣ken up, but there is no fear of want of Land.</P>
<P N="3">3ly. The quantity of Meadow ground we cannot determine, having travelled as yet but litle in the Province, but the way we have travelled, there is meadow abundance, both on the water sides and on the up Land.</P>
<P N="4">4ly. There is also other good ground in some places great quantities free of wood, which is fit either for Corn or Grass, and the ground all over brings furth good English grass naturaly after it is ploughed.</P>
<P N="5">5ly. There are also Commons upon the Countrey, but what quantity we cannot tell, there is litle keept in them save wild horses, which the people take up when they have occa∣sion; There is also Land fit for pasturage for Sheep, and there is their Sheep in the Coun∣trey; but what number the ablest planters have we know not, but some we see have good flocks.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="179" REF="94"/>6ly. An exact Mapp of the Countrey is not yet drawn nor can you quickly expect it, for it will tak up a great deale of time, charge and pains to doe it.</P>
<P N="7">7ly. There are also hills up in the Coun∣trey, but how much ground they take up we know not, they are said to be stony and covered with wood, and beyond them is said to be ex∣cellent land.</P>
<P N="8">8ly. To the Eight we cannot answer as yet.</P>
<P N="9">9ly, There be People of several sorts of Re∣ligion, but few very Zealous; The People be∣ing mostly <HI>New-England</HI> men, doe mostly in∣cline to their way, and in every Town there is a meeting house where they worship publickly every Week; They have no publick Law in the Countrey for mantaining publick Teachers; but the Towns that have them makes way within themselves to maintain them; We know none that hath a setled Preacher that followes no o∣ther Imployment, save one Town New-wark.</P>
<P N="10">10ly. The method of building their houses is mentioned already.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="180" REF="95" MS="y"/>11ly. There are not many Out Plantations that are not within the bounds of some Town; Yet there be some, and these are the richest, what number are there we know not, some have great quantities of Land and abundance cleared.</P>
<P N="12">12ly. The richest Planters have not above <HI>8.</HI> or <HI>10.</HI> Servants, they will have some of them <HI>1</HI> Dozon of Cowes, yea some <HI>20.</HI> or <HI>30. 8.</HI> or <HI>10.</HI> Oxen, horse more then they know themselves, for they keep breading Mears, and keep no more horses at home then they have occasion to work; The rest they let run in the woo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both Winter and Summer, and take them as they have occasion to use them; Swine they have in great flocks in the wood, and Sheep in flocks also, but they lett them not run in the woods for fear of being destroyed by wolves; Their profite arises from the Improvement of their Land, and Increase of their Bestial.</P>
<P N="13">13ly. There will be in most of the Towns already settled at least <HI>100</HI> Houses, but they are not built so regular as the Towns in our Countrey, so that we cannot compear them with any Town we know in <HI>Scotland;</HI> every house in the Town hath a Lott of <HI>4. Acres</HI> ly∣ing to it; so that every one building upon his
<PB N="181" REF="95" MS="y"/> own Lott makes the town Irregular and scatter∣ed; There streets are laid out too large, and the Sheep in the Towns are mostly mantained in them; They are so large that they need not trouble to pave them.</P>
<P N="14">14ly. Betwixt <HI>Sandy-Hook,</HI> and <HI>Lit∣tle Egg harbor lyes 2. Towns Midletoun and Shrewsbery,</HI> there is no Land taken up that way but what is in the bounds of these two Towns; what kind of land it is, we know not, having never travelled that way, <HI>Bor∣nogate or Burning-Holl</HI> is said to be a very good place for fishing, and there is some desir∣ing to take up land there, who inform us that it is good Land, and abundance of <HI>Meadow</HI> lying to it.</P>
<P N="15">15ly. There are no <HI>Fisher-men</HI> that follows only that trade, save some that salt <HI>Whales</HI> upon the Coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, and other Fishes, there is abundance to be had every where through the Countrey in all the Rivers, and the People commonly fish with sives or long netts, and will catch with a sive <HI>1.</HI> sometimes <HI>2.</HI> barrels a day, of good fish, which they salt up mostly for their own use, and to sell to others.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="182" REF="96" MS="y"/>16ly. There is no Ships belonging to this Province particularly, or built here, save one which <HI>Samuel Groome</HI> built here the last Summer, which stands yet in the Stocks (a stop being put to it by his death;) there is conveniency enough to build Shippes, the Shippes in this part trade mostly to the <HI>West-Indian Islands,</HI> and some to <HI>New found-Land,</HI> where the Provisions of this Countrey vends.</P>
<P N="17">17ly. There is land here in several places, after it is cleared and brought into a farm sett out for Rent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as in out Countrey at <HI>5.8.</HI> and <HI>10.</HI> shil. <HI>per Acre.</HI> According to the goodness and scituation of the said Land, and those that will be at charge to clear land may get tennents to take upon these termes; But whither it will turn to good account or not because little experienced as yet with the Charge of clearing of Land. I will not positivly inform.</P>
<P N="18">18ly. There is several places of rhe Coun∣trey fit for mills, and several both Corn and Saw mills already sett up, and good encou∣ragment to sett up more.</P>
<P N="19">19ly. The Acres are here reckoned accord∣ing
<PB N="183" REF="96"/> to the <HI>English</HI> Account; There is <HI>16</HI> foot goes to the Rude, and <HI>20.</HI> Rude long and <HI>8.</HI> Rude broad, makes an Acre; One English butt of Wheat which is <HI>8 English Gallons</HI> or <HI>Scots Quarts,</HI> commonly sows an Acres <HI>2.</HI> bushells of Barlay also an Acre, and <HI>2.</HI> bushells of Oats an Acre, and half Acre; <HI>English</HI> peck which is <HI>4.

<P N="20"><HI>20.</HI> There are but few <HI>Indian-Natives,</HI> in this Countrey; Their strength is inconsi∣derable, they live in the Woods, and have small towns in some places far up in the Coun∣trey; They plant a little <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> shoots Deer, and other wild Beasts and Fowls for their food; They have <HI>Kings</HI> among themselves to Govern them; for <HI>Religion,</HI> they have none at all, they do not refuse to sell Land at occasion.</P>

<P>I Doubt not but you expect here a particular ac∣count of the province of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> but that I thought needless, The person <HI>David Barclay</HI> whom this comes alongst with, being more able to give you that satisfaction, as whose interest oblidgeth him to a more narrow observation of its natural advantages, and whose place being one of the Council, gives a larger liberty and occasion to inspect the concerns of this Province; But in general its a healthfull, plea∣sant fruitful Country, in many places of a most Luxu∣rious Soyle, rewarding the labour of the Country∣man sufficiently, its well watered with many fair and pleasant Rivers and Creeks, stored with seve∣ral sorts of fish, and most of the Rivulets convenient for mills, whereof there are severall both for sowing of wood and grinding of Corn. They raise great store of Hogs &amp; Cattle; and fowls they have in abun∣dance; The Countrey for ten or fifteen miles up from the River and Sea is generally plain; farther up Mountains, besides the Towns mentioned in the publick paper since Governor <HI>Lawries</HI> arrivall, there is laid out at <HI>Amboy-point</HI> 1000. Acres for the City of <HI>Perth</HI> divided into 96. Lotts, 9 Acres to a Lott, the Remainders is for the streets, Mercat place, Go∣vernours house, and other publick conveniencies.

The soyl of the countrey is generally a <HI>red marle ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> with a sur∣face of blak mould (nor doth it appear that rea∣ly it is to their eyes; who cannot penetrat beyond the surface) full fraughted with grass, pleasant hearbs, and flowers, and in many places little or no wood, but most places full of large timber, as walnut, especially oak, there be some places here and there in the Woods, they call swamps, whick is low Ground, amidst or betwixt rising ground full of bushes, which holds water in win∣ter, tho most of them be dry in summer, but these being cleared, and some of them that needs being drained, are the richest land; here are great conveniencies of Bay, Sounds, Rivers, Creeks, Brooks, and Springs, all over the Province; but one of the best things is the large quantities of brave Meadowes, both falt and fresh, which makes the people here able to supply their Neighbours as they doe, throw the abundance of their cattle. I know one Planter who hath a hundred of cattle, not above three years setled, and no wonder for some of the grasse is als high as my head; Its pity to see so much good land as I have been over in this province lying wast, and greater pity to see so much good and convenient land taken, and not improven.</P>
<P>As soon as any of the land here comes to be cul∣tivated, it over-runs with small Claver-grass, by the
<PB N="188" REF="99" MS="y"/> pasturage and dunging of cattle, and so supplants the naturall grass and hearbs, notwithstanding of their quick and strong growth, Fruit trees also pros∣per well here; <HI>Newark</HI> made about a thousand barrell of sider last year (a barrell is 8 <HI>Scots gallons</HI>) this is like that of <HI>Woodbridge;</HI> who made 500 barrels of pork in one year, before the law was made against the swins trespasses.</P>
<P>Here they sow most <HI>Indian corn,</HI> and Wheat, some Rye, Barly, Oats, <HI>Indian corn</HI> the first year that they break up or plough, the second they sow Whea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, be∣cause the spontaneous grouth of the weeds is done a∣way by howing the <HI>Indean corn,</HI> as we do cabboge; here is one planter makes accompt, <HI>That he hath ab∣out three thousand bushels of wheat reapt this year; I</HI> suppose he hath above a hundred acres of it, but I doe not make these instances as so many precedents.</P>
<P>I know nothing wanting here, except that good Tradsmen, and good Husbandmen, and Labourers are scarce; a Labourer may have a bushell of Corn <HI>per day,</HI> when he is a little acquainted with the work of the country, but Tradsmen much more, Smiths, Carpenters, Masons, Weavers, Taylors, Shoe∣makers, are very acceptable; any who comes let them bring some cloaths, and their proper tools with them, as used in <HI>England,</HI> and provide butter, bisket, wine, and especially beer and ale, for their Sea-voyage, besides the ships allowance, and they need not fear when they come here, albiet they have no more, yet they will be the better if they have something, either in money or <HI>Scots</HI> linning, and stuffs to buy a little provision at first, to set them up a house, and buy a cow or two; and tho a man be rich, I would not advise him ro bring many servants, at least not to keep many at first, untill he see about him, and know what he is doing.</P>
<PB N="189" REF="99"/>
<P>I Cannot tell what goods are best to bring, <HI>David Barclay</HI> can tell better; But he who brings money, may expect 15. d. For the <HI>English;</HI> shil: some may bring a Little of the best Wheat for a change of seed, and some barly, and Oats, for the same use; al∣so a Litle <HI>Scots</HI> field pise, there being none such here, bring also some great clower seed.</P>
<P>There are great store of Garding hearbs here, <HI>I</HI> have not had time to inquire unto them all, ne∣ther to send some of the many pleasant (tho to me unknown plants of this Countrey, to <HI>James Suther∣land</HI> Physick Gardiner at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but tell him, I will not forget him, when opportunities offers.</P>
<P>I had forgot to writ of <HI>Ambo,</HI> or <HI>New-Perth,</HI> therefore I add, that it is one of the best places in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> by the report of all Travellers, for a town of trade; for my part, I never saw any so conve∣niently seated; this with my love, and my Wifs to all friends, and acquaintances,</P>

<P>I Have taken up a part of my Land, 9. miles from <HI>Amboy,</HI> and 4. miles from <HI>Piscataway,</HI> and as far from the nearest part of <HI>Rariton,</HI> on a Brook side, where there are exceeding great plains with∣out any Timber, there is excellent Gunning for Dear and Turkies, of which there is great plenty, and easily shot. But I resolve to see a place called <HI>Bernagate,</HI> which is 60. or 70. miles from this, on the Southermost place of the Province, where there is a good River and Harbour, the best Fishing and Gunning in any place in <HI>America</HI> 30. or 40. miles from any Plantation. The Indians here are nothing to be feared, the Place being as peaceable as any where else; I had occasion to travel through <HI>Long-Island.</HI> and <HI>Stallen Island,</HI> and for many miles found as many towns and plantations in the way, as in any so much Land in <HI>Louthean,</HI> there are no Bears
<PB N="193" REF="101"/> nor Ravinous Beasts but Wolves, which are no∣thing to be feared, neither are the Countrey People afraid to be among them all night, in so much as I oft-times going wrong, and lying out all night, and hearing their yells about me, and telling that I was afraid of them, the Countrey People laught at it; neither are the Snakes any thing to be noticed, for nothing can come near them, but they give warn∣ing with the ratling of their tail, so that People may either kill them, or go by them as they please. Oxen are so well taught that they go sometimes in a Plough, or Cart, without Horse, or without a Gade-man; Horses and Cattel are as cheap as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> considering their goodness and the differ∣ence of the Money; All sorts of <HI>Scots</HI> goods sells well here, ye will be advised with the next Occasi∣on, what goods sells best in this place. I have great reason to thank GOD, that I am in a place which abundantly answers any thing I expected; The Air is healthful, and the Soil fruitful; the <HI>Indian</HI> Corn yeelds commonly 2. or 3. hundred fold, Oats 20. fold, as I am informed; the <HI>Indian</HI> Corn is an ex∣cellent grain, I have eat it and likes it very well in Pottage and Bread; there are several reasonable good towns in this Province, most of them hath more then eighty Families; there is no poor persons here, but all are half idle in respect of what they work with you. Flax twice heckled, sold at 9. <HI> d. per pound,</HI> Wool is very cheap, only work is dear; the Liquor we most use is Sider; we have great store of Fruit. In many places untaken up there are many plains and not a tree; I have never since last part∣ing had any sickness to keep me from one Dyet, for which I render thanks to GOD. The <HI>Indians</HI> here make it their trade to kill Venision, and sell it to us: for a smal matter, I will have my Family served with
<PB N="194" REF="102" MS="y"/> Flesh all Winter; one of their <HI>Sashiams,</HI> (which is their King) came to the Governour when I came first here, desiring he might be suffered to trade amongst us, and not to be beat out of our houses, when they were drunk, but only that we might bind them, and permit them to cut timber, and some such things: At <HI>New-Perth,</HI> we have a good Stationers Shop of Books, the land is no where diffi∣cult to clear, albeit trees be 100. foot long and 3. or 4. foot over; I would heartily wish and perswade any to come over that intends to live well, plenti∣fuily and pleasantly: Neither is there any Tradesman or Servant that could come wrong to this place, and I could wish my best friends no better but in the same place with me; the old Inhabitants are a most careless and infrugall People, their profession are most part <HI>Protestants,</HI> few <HI>Quakers,</HI> some <HI>Anabap∣tists,</HI> it is most desired there may be some Ministers sent us over, they would have considerable Bene∣fices, and good Estates; and since it would be a matter of great Piety, I hope ye will be instrumen∣tall to advise some over to us, the place is aboun∣dantly healthfull, as any else; there are a great dif∣ference betwixt the people here, who are Strong and Vigorous, and the people more Southerly in Mariland, we have great store of Venision which is sometimes as fat as Pork; one good Buck is sold at 5. <HI>shil.</HI> and by the <HI>Indian</HI> at 2. <HI>shil.</HI> Oats are sold at 18. <HI>pence</HI> the Bushell; all sorts of Fish is here exceed∣ing plentifull, the poorest Persons ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s no Meat that is Salt, except Pork; in Summer, they live much on Milk. I would no more value the Sea coming through if I had occasion, then ye would riding of of 20. miles; let me be rememberd to all friends, to <HI>Patrick Fortune</HI> who most carefuly disswaded me from this Voyage; which <HI>I</HI> doe not repent, but would

<P>MY last was dated the 22.

I find <HI>Pensil∣vania</HI> and the two <HI>Jerseyes</HI> are the places which set themselves out most for Planting of Corn; As for the <HI>Jersies</HI> I need not insist in commending of them, for <HI>David Barclay</HI> and <HI>Arthur Forbes</HI> who had a lon∣ger stay here than I have had, will give you a more all account; for I intend to write no more than <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="103" MS="y"/> am able to make good. I may say, that it is a pleasant Countrey, I did never see more pleasant Meadows, and Grass, then I have seen in both the <HI>Jersies, I</HI> have seen plains of good Hay consisting of about 30. Acres of ground, hardly one Tree to be seen upon the whole spot. And there are seve∣ral places so; <HI>I</HI> can say, its a well watered Coun∣trey, and good waters, and if they were desirous, they might have very good Quarrie here both for Stone of any sort, and Lime-stone likewise; but so long as Timber is so plenty, they will not be at the pains to seek after Stone; there are some houses in the Countrey built with stone, but very few. Having fallen in here, the end of the year, I cannot be capable to give an account what may be the product of the Countrey, but <HI>I</HI> hear that all sorts of Grain hath very good Increase, I see the Countrey abounds with Apples, Quinches, Peat∣ches, Walnuts, and Chasnuts, and Strawberries in great abundance, wild-Wine-Grapes are plenti∣full, wild-Fowl of all sorts, a great number of Deer, Turckie-Fowls-wild, in great abundance and very bigg, I have seen these things in great plenty: I hope ye will excuse me, because <HI>I</HI> am not capable to give an ampler account of the Countrey, for I have not been two dayes in one place, <HI>I</HI> will tell you this is a good Countrey, for men who resolves to be Laborious; any who comes here they must resolve to work hard for the first two or three years, till they get a little Ground cleared, for this must be looked on as a wood-Countrey, tho I must confess the woods are not so thick as people expects; and there are several places in the Countrey where there is little or no Wood; Peo∣ple are generally curious to have their Land near Navigable Rivers, but when they are better ac∣quaint,
<PB N="198" REF="104"/> they will find that the farther back the bet∣ter is the Land, there are aboundance of Fish and Oysters here, this is not a Countrey for idle people but such as will be at pains, they need not doubt but to get Bread here in plenty, so <HI>I</HI> wish it be the Lords will that we may have a happy meeting again, his will be done, <HI>I</HI> wish you may be protected by the Lord, this from,</P>

<PB N="200" REF="105" MS="y"/> Province; but they are dead; And now the people they meet together every Sabbath day, and Reads and Prays, and sings Psalms in their Meet∣ing-houses: this Countrey is very well settled with People, most part of the first Settlers came out of <HI>New-England,</HI> very kind and loving people, kinder than in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>England.</HI> And for the <HI>Indian Natives,</HI> they are not troublesome any way to any of us, if we do them no harm, but are a very kind and loving people; the men does nothing but hunts, and the women they plant Corn, and works at home; they come and trades among the Christians with Skins or Venison, or Corn; or Pork; And in the Summer time, they and their Wives come down the Rivers, in their Cannoas, which they make themselves of a piece of a great tree, like a little Boat, and rhere they Fish and take Oysters.

<SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY my last about a Moneth since I dated from <HI>Am∣boy,</HI> you understand that we came to <HI>Sandy-Hook,</HI> 18. weeks after we sailed from <HI>Montrofe,</HI> we were 9. weeks at Sea from <HI>Killebeg</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> we had ma∣ny cross winds, what other accidents we met with by the way were worth the telling, but not the writ∣ting; blessed be <HI>God</HI> we all kept our healths very well, only one Boy fell over boord; what you expect, and <HI>I</HI> design by this, is a breef, but true accompt, of the Country. The first land we discovered was About the midle of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> it appeared at first like trees, growing out of the <HI>Sea,</HI> Towards night we Anchored in <HI>Sandy-Hooke;</HI> The land is low and levell, that is the reason we were within 8. or 10. mile thereof, before we saw it; the country appears all over Woodie; <HI>I</HI> landed on a sandie-bank and closs by the flood march, where grew <HI>Bayes, sassafax</HI> and severall prettie shrubs <HI>I</HI> knew not; The Woods consists of severall kinds of Oaks, Chesnut, Hic∣kacy, Walnut, Poplar, and Beetch, Cedars grow on swamps, and barrens Firrs and Pines only on barrens; The ground generally is 2. or 3. inches
<PB N="203" REF="106" MS="y"/> deep of black dung as it were, below that is reedish mould, what you heard of the product of the <HI>Indian Corn, viz.</HI> 100. or 200. fold, of 20 or 30 fold, <HI>Inglish wheat,</HI> of the abundance of dears and wild horse, and severall turkies and of the great plenty of fishes are all true; There is very much Cider here. In 12. or 14. years you may make 100. barrells from your own planting, the best fleshes of all kinds ever I did see are here, tho this in respect of what you have heard, be generally tautollogie; yet <HI>I</HI> found my self oblidged to writ it, because <HI>I</HI> am witness to the truth thereof, without <HI>Hyperbole.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding of all this, its very troublesome expensive to settle a plantation here, and when it is done, <HI>I</HI> cannot promise you a man will grow verry rich; but he needs want nothing, and it is not every one will agree with the solitude of the Woods, these who can, and resolve to lead an countty life, can∣not doe better then come hither; a merchant who will come over and set up store in the country, for a year will make <HI>cent per cent;</HI> of several commodi∣ties with which <HI>I</HI> doe allow none to be acquainted but commerads. I wish <HI>I</HI> had some money of my stock so imployed, and sent safely here, <HI>Johnstouns</HI> of <HI>spois∣wood,</HI> and I haue taken up upon a river, 6, or 8. miles in <HI>Amboy,</HI> your Brother <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Robert,</HI> are here also, servants are not easily intertained here, I designed to have shot als many <HI>squirles</HI> as would have furred a coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for you, but I am other∣wise taken up; I have omitted to tell you that the weather here is constantly clear, the sun rises and setts free of clouds; I have obseved none to have the cough in this country tho I have frequently lyne in the woods; aboundance of fire is an excellent counter charm.

<P>NOw Sir, does not the perusal of thir Letters, obliege you to be∣lieve there is no deceit in the a∣bove written discription of the place, see∣ing you find the same Homollogat by so many different persons; the <HI>Hollograph</HI> of most of them have been perused by many persons in this City, and are to be seen by any inquisitive thereanent at <HI>Captain Hamiltouns</HI> Lodging at the Sign of the Ship, for their more satisfaction of the truth thereof.</P>
<P>But tho you appear to be convinced, that <HI>East-Jersey</HI> is in it self a very desir∣able place, and consequently upon se∣veral considerations a very proper seat
<PB N="208" REF="109"/> for a Collony; From this yet I have ground to conjecture from some tacit hints and insinuations in yours, that be∣cause <HI>West-Jersey, Pensilvania,</HI> and in a speci∣al manner <HI>Carolina,</HI> are more southerly, therefore <HI>you think</HI> there is some ground to believe they may have the advantage of the Soyl, seing you oblidge me to tell you freely my opinion in this affair, I will be plain with you; the two first lying, the one upon the one side of the River of <HI>Delawar,</HI> the other upon the other side thereof, may have in them∣selves other advantages; but I cannot be so blind, when I notice the <HI>Mapp,</HI> as not to discover too palpable an incon∣veniencie to be past over; wherewith both the said Countries are much strait∣ned; <HI>to wit.</HI> the Town of <HI>Newcastle</HI> lying upon the mouth of the River, which doth so absolutly command the River, <HI>that whosoever is master thereof, may if they please, lay what imposition they think fit upon both the said Countries; seeing if any dif∣ference should fall betwixt the Town of Newcastle,</HI> and the Possessors, or Inha∣bitants of these two Provinces, they may make themselves very quickly Masters
<PB N="209" REF="109" MS="y"/> of them, by imposing what conditions they think fit upon them; seeing no. Ship can either conveniently go up or down the said River of <HI>Delawar,</HI> but by allowance of any <HI>Fort,</HI> built upon the said Town of <HI>Newcastle:</HI> Whatever o∣pinion others may have of this as a matter of no great import, I have these sentiments of the apparent inconvenien∣cies thereof, as after perceiving it never to be any more so much concerned, as to make farther inquiry after these places seeing in my apprehension, no advan∣tage to be proposed there could compense that so visible conveniency.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Carolina,</HI> I confess it is nothing strange that any person who hath read <HI>Ogibies</HI> description thereof in his <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Wilsons</HI> in his Treatise thereanent; Judge it in a maner a <HI>Terrestiral Paradise,</HI> but notwithstanding of all this, err you pass any judgement upon my choising rather <HI>East-Jersey,</HI> then <HI>Carolina</HI> for the seat of a Collony from this, allow me to give my Reasons why I do prefer the one to the other.</P>
<PB N="210" REF="110"/>
<P>We lye here in 56. Degrees of <HI>Northren Latitude, Jersey</HI> in 41. <HI>Carolina</HI> in 31. it is very obvious to any understanding per∣son, that our removall to 41. is more probably contributive for our health, then to 31, being ten degrees hotter; and consequently more dangerous, what e∣ver opinion others may have of this, I judge it a matter of no smal consequence, health being very much preferrable to all other things whatsoever.</P>
<P>But further, our access to <HI>East-Jersey</HI> is very patent, no apparent obstruction in the way, whereas the coast of <HI>Carolina</HI> is the most dangerous in all <HI>America,</HI> there being a bank of sand lying all along the same for 200. Leags and up∣wards, so that the entry to any part thereof is altogether hazardous, we have too sad a proof of the truth of this, by the Shipwrack of the <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Air,</HI> upon that bank this last Harvest, in which were lost upwards of 60. peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>Experience also teacheth that the Cly∣mate of <HI>Jersey,</HI> is far move suitable to our <HI>Constitutions,</HI> then that of <HI>Carolina;</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="110"/> You find in all the Letters come from <HI>Jersey,</HI> this one particular specially mark∣ed, <HI>That it is a very healthfull Air;</HI> no complaints of sickness there, whereas in the few Letters from our Countrey men settled in <HI>Carolina;</HI> You have an accompt of the <HI>death of the greatest part who went hence to that place.</HI></P>
<P>There is one further consideration ob∣lidging me altogether, to close my Ears and Eyes against <HI>Carolina;</HI> whatever specious pretences may flie abroad in fa∣vours thereof, and be received by such who are not concerned, to enquire fur∣ther, then to <HI>hear-say,</HI> and that is the con∣sideration of the model of their Govern∣ment, then which nothing can be more discouraging to any having the sence of a rational Man, or Spirit of a Gentleman. The Offices of Honour and Trust, such, as <HI>Chancellour, Thesaurer, Admiral, Secretar, &amp;c.</HI> are all Heretably annexed to the Proprietors; by the constitu∣tion of their Government, so that let a Gentleman deserve never so well, how∣ever eminent his parts may be, he must in the first place purchase a property, err he can attain to any of these places of
<PB N="212" REF="111"/> Trust, or Honor; whereas if you have so much Money as to make this purchase, you may then come to these preferments though you were the <HI>arrentest Block head in nature!</HI> Money here makes you ca∣pable of Preferment, which neither Ver∣tue, Merit, nor parts can do! Can there be a greater discouragement to any per∣son of <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Honour,</HI> than to go subject himself to a Government where he sees himself debarred of any Trust or Prefer∣ment, how ever deserving he may be? unless he hath money in a manner to buy it with. Both in this <HI>Kingdom</HI> and our <HI>Neighbour Nations,</HI> we see mean Per∣sons have by their Parts and Merit raised themselves to places of the highest Pre∣ferments in the Kingdoms, and have discharged that Trust conferred upon them with <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Applause;</HI> So that when I have this consideration before my Eyes, I must conclude any who subjects themselves to that <HI>model of Government,</HI> are either ignorant of the Constitutions thereof, or of very mean Spirits, to settle themselves in a place where Vertue nor Merit can neither raise them, nor their Posterity!</P>
<PB N="213" REF="111"/>
<P>Let me add another Ground of my dissatisfaction with the <HI>Model of that Go∣vernment,</HI> and you may judge whether the same be reasonable or not; There are <HI>eight Proprietors by their Constitutions,</HI> it appears clear to me, that they are so many <HI>Soveraigns,</HI> seing by one express <HI>Article</HI> of their <HI>Fundamental Constitutions,</HI> it is declared, <HI>That the Proprietors are no waves subject to Law, in so far as to be cen∣sured by any Judicatur there;</HI> So that be their Actings never so Illegal, or unjust; if any these <HI>eight Proprietors</HI> should com∣mit Murders, or Rapes, or any other Act of Oppression, they cannot be challeng∣ed upon accompt thereof in any <HI>Judica∣tory</HI> in <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>These being so matterial Objections, I need not add the apparent hazard of be∣ing next Neighbour to the <HI>Spainard,</HI> whose interest it is to ruine any setling at <HI>Port Royal;</HI> how little probability there is, that any going at first from this can be of sufficient strength to defend them∣selves against their designs, that in case of any assault from that airth; their nixt and only neighbour, <HI>Charles-toun,</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="112"/> could not give that help, which were requisit in such an exigent, either against the <HI>Spainards</HI> their nixt neighbours, at <HI>St. Augustines</HI> Fort, or the <HI>Natives,</HI> if they should become <HI>quarrelsome Neighbors;</HI> But from the complext consideration of all together, I must divest my self of my reason, or I judge <HI>Carolina</HI> a proper seat to settle my self in.</P>
<P>But tho you be oblidged to grant, that <HI>East-Jersey,</HI> may be the most desirable spott of ground upon the continent of <HI>A∣merica</HI> for such a design, upon the above written considerations; yet I do appre∣hend you may incline to think that <HI>To∣bago, St. Luce, St. Vincent,</HI> or some of these Islands were yet more proper as affoording at first view greater ground of expecting suitable returns to the apparent expense &amp; hazards of such a undertaking; witness the great riches of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> by the improvment of a Trade, from that place all <HI>Europe</HI> over.</P>
<P>In answer to this, I must confess, Sir, that there may be greater improvements of such Islands as to trade, when they do come to that length of improve∣ment, as to produce <HI>Suggars, Cotton,
<PB N="215" REF="112"/> Indigo, &amp;c.</HI> But let me also tell you, there is a certain prospect of far greater &amp; more imminent hazards in settling there, then in <HI>East-Jersey.</HI> It is certainly obvious to the meanest capacities what hardships these must be oblidged to lay their compt to meet with who would interprise such a design, not only from the wants thy might be exposed to throw lake of ne∣cessar supplies, wherewith they cannot ex∣pect the conveniencie of being furnished. but from other hazards and difficulties. It is not small stock could set such a de∣sing on foot, neither can it be expected that such who would ingadge in such un∣dertaking from this place could in many years attain to that strength, which were necessarily requisite for defending them∣selves even against the Piracy of a <HI>Bucca∣nier</HI> or two, far less against the invasions or assaults of forraign States and Princes.</P>
<P>As for my own part I must confess, I am not very anxious of great Riches, as the result of this undertaking, but to carry my Wife and Children with me; I am bound the best I can to look to their Accommodation; when I land in <HI>East-Jersey</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="113"/> there are Lodgings, and all other necessars to be had for money, till by our own industry in Labouring the Ground, we provide for our selves, which could not be expected in one of these Islands; If I have a Countrey no worse than the <HI>South of France,</HI> with these Conveniencies above narrated, I desire no richer Soyl; though greater expecta∣tions might be had of the result of such a design of setling in one of these Islands, as to Profit and Gain, when once come the length of a good Trade.</P>
<P>But besides this, <HI>our Countrey People</HI> which will be the <HI>strength of any Collony,</HI> to go from this place, <HI>knows very well how to labour the Ground, for producing all sorts of Grains, after what fashion, to breed abun∣dance of all sorts of Bestial, in both which, will the great riches of</HI> Jersey <HI>consist; But it cannot he expected, that they know how to im∣prove these Islands, for</HI> Suggar, Cotton, In∣digo, <HI>&amp;c. and this being altogether out of their road, we should thus be altogether deprived of the assistance we may rationally expect from them, by proposing to settle in a place where the</HI> Nigro Slaves <HI>could do more service, and
<PB N="217" REF="113"/> be far more usefull than the most laborious▪ and judicious of</HI> our Countrey People.</P>
<P><HI>As for the ordinar</HI> Objection <HI>against setl∣ing in</HI> Jersey, <HI>upon account of the inconvenien∣cies may arise from having a</HI> Governour <HI>of Principles alledged inconsistent with the stand∣ing of any Society; upon this one head menti∣oning no other, that a man who professes, he</HI> judges it unlawful to draw his sword to defend himself agains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Na ive, if he were coming to cut his throat, can never be so careful in providing such certain and speedy remedies for preventing any hazard that way, as are absolutely requi∣site for the security of these who settle there, both against any Designs of the <HI>Na∣tives</HI> or Forraign Invasions. <HI>This is very easily answered, that there being several very substantial Citizens of</HI> London <HI>concerned in this Plantation, who are not of this Principle, who have laid out considerable summs on this Design, as I am oblidged to know by the ac∣compt I have from one of them, with whom I have some correspondence; who tells me,</HI> he himself hath laid out 1800. pound; <HI>It cannot rationally be supposed that they will be so unconcerned, as not to follow such measures as may secure what interest they have there; Me∣thods
<PB N="218" REF="114"/> are already laid down, which I know will satisfie you in this particular, that as to defence against any such inconveniencies;</HI> East Jersey <HI>will be as effectually secured as any of the Neighbouring Plantations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As for any other Apprehensions you or others may have upon this head, I shall only say,</HI> what ever Mr. <HI>Barclays</HI> Principles may be, he is a Gentleman known to be a∣bundantly qualified to advance the inte∣rest of that Collony, else the Trust there∣of had not been devolved upon him by the Proprietors, who are Men more knowing in their own Affairs, then to have made an escape in so matterial a point; they are Men abundantly sharp∣sighted to remark his Actions, and ac∣cordingly as they find them for the in∣terest of the place, to continue him in that Trust or not; And you may be assured, he understands himself so well, as to behave himself in that station so as becometh a Gentleman, concerned in his own Credit and Interest, seing upon the least <HI>malversation,</HI> he is als well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vable to censure of the Law, as the meanest Inha∣bitant. <HI>Which consideration abundantly se∣cures
<PB N="219" REF="114"/> any reasonable Man against the Appre∣hensions of any inconveniencie from his being Go∣vernour, tho his inclinations prompted him to act upon a selfish design, to the prejudice of the general interest of that Province, I perswade my self, he is more a Gentleman, than ever to be guilty of any thing that is base, or unbecom∣ing a Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is now more then time to bid you farewel, having nothing further to add, hoping from what is here said, you will rest satisfied, that in prosecuting this design, I do act upon so∣lid foundations, let the result be what it will; I hope you are convinced I have not pro∣ceeded indeliberatly therein; I am not so foolish as to propose no difficulties to my self to be ran∣countered, notwithstanding all the incourage∣ments above written, I am too well acquainted with all the</HI> Spanish, French, Dutch, Portugues, <HI>&amp;</HI> English <HI>undertakings of this nature, and their staits and difficulties they have been trysted with in prosecuting thereof, to think I have any ground to expect to be al∣together exeemed from all the inconveniencies they met with; as to this I cast my self alto∣gether upon the divine Providence, being con∣vinced, I am in my duty; if you please to

<SALUTE>Dear Andrew,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Suppose ye have heard of our voyage from my Brother, and Governour <HI>Barclay;</HI> I shall only in short tell you that notwithstanding the loss of our masts, we were only <HI>8.</HI> weeks betwixt land and land, and entered the <HI>Capes</HI> of <HI>Virginia</HI> the same day <HI>9.</HI> weeks we parted from <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> We sailed up <HI>Chessapeck</HI> bay to the head of <HI>Bohemia-River</HI> in <HI>2.</HI> slowpes, from thence we came to <HI>Elizabeth-Town,</HI> partly by Land and partly by Water, the storm being the tail of a <HI>Hurricane,</HI> was not uni∣versall, for we heard of no Ships which met with it but our selves; nor the <HI>Montrose</HI> Ship did not meet with it. There is incourage∣ment for several trades here, in the first place Planting, for <HI>Wheat, Indian Corn; Beef, Pork,</HI> &amp;c. give all ready money in <HI>York,</HI> and the Neighbour Collonies; Wheat <HI>4.</HI> shillings the
<PB N="224" REF="117"/> bushel, <HI>Indian</HI> Corn <HI>2.</HI> ss. or half a crown, Pork and Beef, &amp;c. to be had at an ordinary easie rate. And in the second place there may be Fishing; For the <HI>Inhabi∣tants</HI> averr they swim so thick in the Creeks and Rivers, at certain seasons of the year, that they have hailed them out of the waters with their very hand. In the third place for one to have a Malt-house, a brew house, and a bake-house, to make Malt, brew beer, and bake biskeet for <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and the Neighbour Collonies, pro∣viding he have a ship of his own, and skill to manage his busines, would certainly be a good trad. Lastly for one to buy up the product of the Countrey, such as all kinds of grains, Beef, Pork, &amp;c. and export them to <HI>Barba∣does,</HI> and import <HI>Rumm</HI> and <HI>Malasses,</HI> would certainly be a good trade; as likewise change keeping wold be a good trad in <HI>Amboy,</HI> for the highest designe of the old <HI>Buckskine</HI> Planters (I am just now drinking to one of them; our Countrey man who was sent away by <HI>Cromvel</HI> to <HI>New-England,</HI> a slave from <HI>Dumbar,</HI> Living now in <HI>Woodbridge, Like a Scots Laird,</HI> wishes his <HI>Countrey men</HI> and <HI>Native Soyle</HI> very well, though he never intends to see it. Pardon this Paren∣thesis) is to acquite a piece of monie to drink
<PB N="225" REF="117" MS="y"/> in the change house. This Countrey, and particularly this Town (showeth it to be the best scituated for a city of any there known in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>) is but yet in infancie (it not being above <HI>48.</HI> years at most since ever there was a Planter in the Province; &amp; that occasioned by their chang∣ing so many Masters) yet there are several thou∣sands of People already, and not want of good company, and if ye please badd too, as in any place of the world; neither are we altogether destitut of <HI>Books</HI> and <HI>Clergy,</HI> for <HI>George Keith,</HI> (who arrived three weeks since with others, they were all winter in <HI>Borbadoes</HI>) hath brought <HI>Mathema∣ticks,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Clark</HI> a <HI>Libra∣rie of Books,</HI> to sell; so that you may see <HI>New Perth</HI> begins to be founded upon <HI>Cler∣gy.</HI> Shew my Cusins, <HI>George-Burnet,</HI> and <HI>Richard Maitland,</HI> that I hope they will not laugh more at me, for saying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Edinburgh, <HI>I would line my house with Cedar-wood,</HI> for all houses here are cover∣ed with <HI>Cedar;</HI> and one just now built in <HI>Perth,</HI> altogether of <HI>Cedar-Wood,</HI> it is reckoned a wood of no value here, except for its lastiness. I intend to follow Planting my self, and if I had but the small Stock here I have in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with some more servants,
<PB N="226" REF="118"/> I would not go home to <HI>Aberdeen</HI> for a <HI>Re∣gencie,</HI> as was profered me; neither do I in∣tend it however, hoping, to get my own safe over; we are not troubled here leading our pitts, mucking our Land, and Ploughing <HI>3.</HI> times; one Plouing with <HI>4.</HI> or <HI>6.</HI> Oxen at first breaking up; and with <HI>2.</HI> horse only thereafter, suffices for all; you may judge whither, that be easier <HI>Husbandrie</HI> than in <HI>Scotland;</HI> But I know you are no good <HI>Hus∣band-man.</HI> But which of the foresaid trades you will choice, if you will come here you self is more then I can divine, or will advise you to; I have told you how things are, and in <HI>Gods-Name</HI> take your own choice, as I have done. I shall tell you what I would do, were I in your place, if it shall fall out you do come, <HI>I</HI> would get some trusty Comorads, Merchants to joyn with me, and sett up a trade in <HI>Perth,</HI> for I think a mans own trade fitts him best; if you have <HI>5000.</HI> Merks it is enough, <HI>4.</HI> in goods and one in money, Let none come here destitute of money, it is of great request here, and gets chape Penyworths, and <HI>25. per cent</HI> of advantage by it; but I doe not advise you, for if you should meet with such trouble and disopoyntments as we have done by being put by our <HI>Post,</HI> you would perhapps be dis∣couraged,
<PB N="227" REF="118"/> &amp; give me the blame; all our baggadg is not yet come from <HI>Maryland,</HI> and I want yet my bed Cloathes, and the Land I intend to settle on is not yet purchassed from the <HI>In∣dians;</HI> for after I have viewed all the <HI>Province</HI> such of it as is yet habitable, I have chosen the <HI>South branch</HI> of <HI>Rariton-River</HI> for conveniency of Fishing, Fowling, and Mea∣dow, but all the best Land lyes back from the Rivers and the Sea Costs; the further back the better it is, which necessitates me to go a mile back. In breif what you heard of the coun∣trey is all true, so I need not spine out long Discriptions of it; no unbyassed and in∣different Person will speak ill of the Land, it is both pleasant and wholesome, and industrous People, after some few years Labour, may lead a pleasant, easie Life, and want for no∣thing; And I am of opinion, may grow rich too, if they take pains for it, and follow Mer∣chandising, and some are actaually grown rich since they came here, who had nothing before; if any shal miscredit what I have said, I shall not think my self baffled for that; but let them live in their opinion and I will live in mine. And if they please they may do with me as I did with <HI>John Skeens</HI> Wife, cast my Letters in mine own teeth, and when
<PB N="228" REF="119"/> they come upon the place, I shall make good what I say, face to face, as she did to me, and if they come not themselves, they need not trouble themselves whither it be true or false. The goods fit for this Countrey are all kind of house-hold Plenishing, without which and a years provision in victualls, let none come hither; if they would wish not to be preyed on by the old Planters. All course cloath such as hodden-grayes, and Playding, course Stock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns and Linning, no fine things, for an infant <HI>Countrey,</HI> except for a mans own use; course Bedding and Blankets; Governour <HI>Barclay</HI> can give you full information as to this point. The Inconveninencies we have met with are, great trouble and charges for want of our baggadge; there is likewise trouble and charges in the first setlement, in carting out ones goods to the woods; fencing is the cheif Difficulty, and if the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e be many great trees the logges most be drawn off with oxen and the branches burned, the trees are falled equal to a mans thigh hight, but the roots are no im∣pediments, where is much brush the roots most be plucked up with grubbing howes; any man may learn Husbandries here, who was not a∣quaint with it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> (Tobacco would grow here as well as in <HI>Maryland,</HI> but it is
<PB N="229" REF="119"/> best for <HI>European graines;</HI> I doe not in∣tend, to write more Letters to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> with this occasion; being busied about mine own setlement, therefore I intreat you will re∣member me to all my friends, Relations, Com∣arads, and Acquaintances at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and shew them of my wellfair that I had not my health so well this <HI>7.</HI> years bygone, as now (Blessed be God) and that I am not troubled here with coughs, and head aikes as in <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> which is likewise a great motive for me, to stay in this Countrey. I intreat to hear from them all, you will not readily miss occasions from <HI>London</HI> every Moneth, to some place in <HI>America;</HI> And there is ordi∣narly occasions hither from the Neighbour Col∣lonies; <HI>I</HI> have received Letters from the <HI>Bis∣sets,</HI> and my Brother, from <HI>Mr. Alexan∣der</HI> since we came; <HI>I</HI> intreat to hear particul∣arly from the <HI>Professor of Divinitie,</HI> and <HI>Mathematicks, Doctor Pitcairn,</HI> Mr. <HI>George Burnet, Richard Maitland,</HI> Mr. <HI>George Alexander,</HI> and any others who shall ask for me, wishing you and all your con∣cerns well,</P>

<P>If any pleases to tell me what their scruples are, I shall endeavour to answer them, if Servants knew what a Countrey this is for them, and that they may live like little Lairds here; I think they would not be so Shey as they are to come, and during their service they are better used then in any place in <HI>America</HI> I have seen; you may know my Subscription by the sign I gave you of my Pistoles misserving in the Boat, or at least when you tell your Mother, you may mind on me, for you will miss some pints of wine you spent with me, (that Fridays night, you convoyed me aboard) on the Shore, and in the Ship. If there were a Caball of Merchants here to export the product of the Countrey to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and to Import <HI>Rumm, Malasses, Suggar</HI> and <HI>Cot∣ton, &amp;c.</HI> it would do a great deal of good to this Countrey.

English</HI> miles, and having left our Goods behind us, which was thereafter to come about in a <HI>Sloup</HI>) we was necessitat to stay all Winter in this New and young Citie, where we had but very bad Commodation for Lodging, tho we knew of no want of Victuals of all sorts for mony, tho at a considerable dear rate; This hindered us long from our falling to work about our husbandries, which was a great loss of time to us. However when our sloup came about,
<PB N="241" REF="125"/> (which did not hold the half of our goods; So that every man yet wants the half of his goods. But are dayly expecting them by the same <HI>Sloup</HI> which we fraghted thither back again. I went out to the Woods to the land we had pitched upon, with several others of our Coun∣teey men, such as <HI>Tho: Gordon,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Chat:</HI> his Brother, Brothers to the Laird of <HI>Straloch, Kinnabers</HI> two Sons, <HI>Robert</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Fullertons, James Johnston</HI> of <HI>Spotswood,</HI> and <HI>John Barclay</HI> the Go∣vernours Brother, with some others; where we have all pitched near by one another, upon an piece of excellent land as we suppose; Whereof I judge I have not the worst, (if not the absolute best piece of land in all that Tract, for we had it all at our own choising and not by lots, this land lyes not on a Navigable River, but about <HI>5.</HI> or <HI>6.</HI> miles from <HI>Rariton</HI> river, which is Navigable up the nearest place to our Plan∣tations; For the best places of the Rivers are already inhabited by the old Planters of this Countrey who have been here some <HI>16.</HI> or <HI>18.</HI> years agoe. There are many places upon Na∣vigable Rivers yet untaken, and some very near this place also, which is intended to be the <HI>Metrapolis</HI> of this Province; But it is generally sandy barren land, and the best
<PB N="242" REF="126"/> land is compute by all to be in the woods, back some several miles from the Navigable Rivers; So that we rather chuse land for profitablness, then for Conveniences of Towns, and pleasure allennarly. For there is aboun∣dance both of good and barren land in this Province; So that a man may chuse some for pleasure, and some for profit and Conveniency, for I intend to take up about <HI>4.</HI> or <HI>500.</HI> Acres where I have now setled; which is on a very pleasant place and good land, and whereof I have with two hands (not having had time to get many Servants away with me, having come away upon so short advertisement, and whereof I lost one at <HI>Maryland</HI> by sickness; so that now I have but two, and a Woman for dressing our Victuals and Cloaths, till I get more sent me this year) already cleared, or at least will clear; and have in Corn this year about <HI>8,</HI> or <HI>10,</HI> Acres of ground; tho it was prettie thick of stately tale Timber, and that since the <HI>26.</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> at which time, I went to the Woods. I have <HI>1000.</HI> Acres to take up at this time out of the first Division of <HI>10000.</HI> Acres ordained to be laid out to every Proprietor; I having bought a <HI>10.</HI> part, whereof my Brother is half sharer. I have al∣so taken up <HI>400.</HI> Acres of excellent fine land on
<PB N="243" REF="126"/> <HI>Rariton</HI> River, about <HI>20.</HI> miles above <HI>Am∣boy,</HI> whereon I design to set Servants, that I expect over this ensuing Summer; and so to divide our said parcels, and improve them for a year or two to the best advantage, and then to sell them off. If I design to come home, which we can do at good profite. Now for a general description of this Countrey, it is a fine place for those who have a good stock, to lay out upon a stock of Cattel of all sorts, which do greatly multiply here in a short time, and are sold at great rates, and may soon increase a stock greatly; or it is a good Countrey for an Industrious Frugal Man, that designes to fol∣low Husbandries closlie; providing he bring but some little stock to stock a Plantation with∣all; or it is very good for Tradsmen, as good Carpenters, Smiths, Tailors, &amp;c. who will get large wages a day. But it is not a Coun∣trey for idle sluggish People; or those who cannot some times put too their hands, and en∣courage their Servants. It is a place that pro∣duces many fine Fruits, and Physick Herbs; The Woods are stored with wild Deers, Conies, Woulves, Boars, Racouns, some Bavers, and several other Beasts, which have fine Furrs. There is also abundance of Fowls, and Fish, and Water Fowl for the killing. The Timber
<PB N="244" REF="127"/> are mostly Oak of all sorts, Walnut, Chesnut, whereof there are great abundance where I have planted, tho they bescarce so bigg as these that comes to <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet large as pleasant. Strawberries grow very thick upon the ground amongst the Trees; so that some places of the Woods are in Summer as it were covered with a red cloath. As I am certainly informed, Fruit Trees advance at a great rate in this place, for a Man may have an Orchard within a few years after the Planting, that may yeeld him a great quantitie of Cydar, which is the chief∣est of their drink in this Province, even amongst the meanest of the Planters; So that this Countrey if well improved, may make a fine place; for Nature has been defficient in nothing to it, either for pleasure or fruitfulness of the Soyl; So that a man being once settled two or three years in it, and having Corn, Cattle, and all things necessary for the use of man within himself. And the trouble and hard∣ship of his first settling by his hand; He may live as Comfortably here as in any place of the World; Providing he could dispence with the want of his Friends and Relations, and the sa∣tisfacti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of their Companie, which is the loss <HI>I</HI> most regrate in this place; And thus having given yon a short description of the place, I
<PB N="245" REF="127"/> cannot but in the next place, much regrate my misfortune, in not seeing you, and taking your advise before I came to this place; But my Resolution was so sudden, by the encouragement <HI>I</HI> received from the Chief Governour, and some of the Proprietors at <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> and having come in onely to see my Sister with my Brother; and by the many Gentlemen that were going a∣long in the ship, that I was induced to go along without so much as taking my leave of any of my Friends, save onely these that were then in Town; So that I came of resolution only to see the place, and to settle onlie if I fand conve∣niency. And having thus abruptly come away, when I came here, I designed not to return till I took some tryal of the Countrey, that at my re∣turn I might be the more able to give an true accompt thereof. I am not as yet of any deter∣mined resolution as to my staying for altogether as yet; but I resolved to stay this year, till I see what the ground produces; and to see how my endeavours take effect; and GOD willing, be that time, I may in some measure be resolved what to do, for then the greatest hardship will be over my head; and by that time I will have up an prettie good house, which is near already framed; whereas hitherto I have dwelt for the most part here in a <HI>Wigwam,</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="128"/> (as we call them here) accounting all our hard∣ship in the beginning but short, in expectation of good success in the end. But however <HI>I</HI> may be resolved hereafter, I intend GOD willing, life and health serving to come home a start within this year or two, and see all my Friends; and apollogize the best manner I can, for my abrupt departure. Now having thus in some mea∣sure discharged a part of my dutyfull respects towards you by this line, in letting you know of my welfare and present condition; Earnestly desiring ye will favour me with a return by the first occasion; wherein I shall be glade to hear of your welfare, of your kind Ladies and Children (To whom and others my nearest Freinds and Relations, and Comarads, I desire the favour to be Kindly remembered, begging pardon for this trouble, and your patience to peruse this, when your leasure can permit; and afterwards to communicat it to my Ʋncle, <HI>Calder-hall</HI> and his Lady, or to my Cusins <HI>Harie Lockhart,</HI> or <HI>George Ersken,</HI> if they call for it; I not having time at present to write to them at length, as I have in haste done to you; I shall forbear to give you furder trouble at present; intreating you to remember me kindly to your Worthy and Oblidging

Against this extream we have a good Defence of Fire, and felling of Trees, and might live warm enough, were we not forced to travell for recruit of Provisions. I reckon the winter to consist only of nights, for the <HI>Suns</HI> ap∣pearance by day moderateth the cold, and melts the Frost; I do not find the cold here to cause obstructions or coughs; the Air is ever transsparent; we have singular good stomachs, which if it con∣tinue as they say, it will require a fer∣tile Countrey when peopled; the water

<SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> Mr. <HI>George,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis is the fifth time <HI>I</HI> have written to you since I came to <HI>America,</HI> some of which <HI>I</HI> am confident have
<PB N="255" REF="132"/> come safe to your hands; so that I need not now resume them, for in them I gave you a full account of our danger by Sea, and travels by Land; and therefore I shall now proceed and begin where I left last, upon the eighteen day of <HI>November</HI> I and my Servants came here to the Woods, and <HI>8.</HI> dayes thereafter my Wife and Children came also; I put up a Wigwam in <HI>24.</HI> hours, which served us till we put up a better house, which <HI>I</HI> made <HI>24.</HI> foot long, and <HI>15.</HI> foot wide, containing a Hall and Citchen both in one, and a Chamber and a Study, which we put up pretty well (with Pallisadoes on the sides, and Shingles on the roof) against <HI>Yuill,</HI> on which day we entred home to it, and have been ever since, and still am clearing ground, &amp; making fencing; So that <HI>I</HI> hope to have as much ground, clear∣ed, fenced, ploughed, and planted with <HI>Indian Corn</HI> in the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> (which is the best time for planting it) as will main∣tain my Family the next year, if it please GOD to prosper it; <HI>Robert Fullertoun</HI> and I are to joyn for a Plough this Spring, con∣sisting of <HI>4.</HI> Oxen and two Horse, but if the Ground were once broken up, two Oxen and two Horse, or <HI>4.</HI> Oxen alone, will serve; so that the next spring I intend (GOD willing)
<PB N="256" REF="133"/> to have a Plough of my own alone; I intend to build a better House and larger, and to make a Kitchen of this I am in; which I will hardly get done this Summer, because I re∣solve to build upon my lot at <HI>New-Perth;</HI> I am settled here in a very pleasant place, u∣pon the side of a brave plain (almost free of woods) and near the water side, so that <HI>I</HI> might yoke a Plough where I please, were it not for want of Hay to maintain the Cattle which I hope to get helped the next year, for <HI>I</HI> have several pieces of Meadow near me. The first Snow we had was about the midst of <HI>November,</HI> &amp; went twice away again, and about the end of the Moneth it came on, and continued with very great Frost and knee deep Snow till towards the end of January; And then the Snow dissolved pleasantly and calmly with the heat and influence of the Sun, and now I judge it as warm here as it will be with you in <HI>May,</HI> and much more pleasant, for we are not by far so much troubled with winds here as ye are in <HI>Scotland;</HI> the winter was generall very pleasant and calm, altho sometimes very vehement frost; I have spoken with several old Inhabitants here, who assure me they had not seen so hard a winter as this has been these <HI>16</HI> years bygone; and truely

<P>I Nothing question but by the perus∣all of the above written Letters, you are abundantly satisfied, that <HI>East-Jersey</HI> as to all things necessar will accommodat our present design; But if some <HI>(Malevolent Persons)</HI> who because
<PB N="264" REF="137"/> they have not the courage nor resolut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to adventure upon such an undertaking themselves, do cavill at the design in others, may insinuat that the greatest part of these Letters being written by Gentlemen; it may be presumed; in∣terest may oblidge them to represent things otherwise then they are, to the advantage of the place. This is easily answered, that there are severall per∣sons in this Town, who have been upon the place, who have perused all their Letters, and declare they find nothing contained therein, that they can contra∣dict; But as for a further proof thereof, I have thought fit to conclude with a letter from a Masson, sent over as a Servant, by Captain <HI>Hamiltoun,</HI> he being a plain Countrey-man, it is not very probable he can have any design; I had the Let∣ters from his said Master; as followeth,</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from <HI>James Cockburn</HI> Masson, Servitour in <HI>East-Jersey</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> to Captain <HI>Hamiltoun,</HI> at the Ship-tavern in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> dated the 12. of <HI>March,</HI> 1685. to his Uncle <HI>James Broun,</HI> Shoe∣maker in <HI>Kelso.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UNcle these few Lines do testifie that I am well and in good health, bles∣sed be GOD for it, desiring to hear the like from you, for I am very well in this land of <HI>America;</HI> We lake neither wild nor tame to eat; the most part of our drink is <HI>Rumm, Cyder,</HI> and Beer; such as have these to sell, drives a very good Trade. I am working at my work daily, in good wea∣ther, and have very good incouragment among the old Planters; if my Sister <HI>Katharin</HI> in∣cline to come over, she may have good service here and <HI>Francie</HI> also; it is better to be bound some few years then come free except they have a good stock; it is dear living here the first year or two: The <HI>Indians</HI> are a harmless People and very kind to us, they are not a harie Peo∣ple as was said to us in <HI>Scotland;</HI> a Shoe∣maker would live very well here, if he bring any store of Leather with him, the Shoes are five or six shillings a pair; there is nothing discourages us more then want of Ministers
<PB N="266" REF="138"/> here; but now they have agreed about their Stipends, there is one to be placed in <HI>New-Perth, Piscattaway, Woodbridge,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth Town,</HI> they have a mind to bring them from <HI>Scotland; Uncle</HI> I hope you will let me know of your welfare; and how the Town is repaired again, and so I rest your <HI>Nephew</HI> untill death, <HI>John Cockburn</HI></P>

<P>THese are to show you that I am in good health blessed be GOD for it, wishing to hear the like from you; We had a long Voyage, but we came very well to our Harbour in this place of <HI>America,</HI> within a stone-cast of my Masters Lott; it is upon the very Harbour; this Town is scituate betwixt two great Rivers, the one called <HI>Ra∣riton,</HI> the other <HI>Hudsons;</HI> It is a very plea∣sant Countrey and good for all Tradsmen; You was angry with me for coming away, but <HI>I</HI> re∣pent nothing of it my self, for <HI>I</HI> have abun∣dance of Imployment; I am at the building of a great stone house in <HI>New-Perth,</HI> with an∣other <HI>Scots-man.</HI> They build most with
<PB N="267" REF="138"/> Timber, but are beginning to build with stone; there is as good stone in this Countrey as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if they were at the pains to find it out; there are not many of our Trade in this Province; Any who hath a mind to come here will get good wages, these who have a mind to come here will do far better then in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI> I have no more desire to my <HI>Native-Countrey</HI> then I had never been in it; they had better be bound some years with a good Master, then come over frree, for it is dear living at first here. The Natives of this land are a harmless People, they do wrong no to no man, they are very kind to us: tell my sister if she please to come over, she may have good service here; Remember me to all Friends, and Comorads in <HI>Kelso,</HI> and so I rest your <HI>Cusing,</HI> while I live,</P>
