<HEAD>From <HI>Prage</HI> the <HI>4.</HI> of <HI>November, 1631.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Citie is every where exceedingly for∣tified, and amended. Great feare also is conceived in this place, wherefore, men transport their goods and flie to <HI>Vienna.</HI> For the Duke of <HI>Saxons</HI> Forces are en∣quartered in this Kingdome of <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> and doe encroach day by day vpon vs. As also the <HI>Swedish</HI> are fallen into <HI>Silesia</HI> at least fifteene thousand strong, where they haue taken <HI>Great Glogaw</HI> of late and divers other places of moment. Yea they haue shew∣ed themselues in a victorious manner, even before <HI>Breslau.</HI> Which hath caused the Emperours forces mainly to intend against them. Who with all expedition are marching to∣wards them.</P>
<P>His Imperiall Majestie this day, as also divers times of late himselfe in person hath beene present in the Counsell of Warre, and with them consulted, how and by what meanes a mightie Armie may speedily be raised. To this effect the Lord <HI>Questenburg</HI> is speedily sent to the Duke of <HI>Freid∣land,</HI> and Commissions are graunted from his Imperiall Ma∣jestie, for the levying and raising of an hundred thousand men.</P>
<P>The Chancelor of the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> Lord of <HI>Eu∣dern,</HI> who had with him many confiscated goods in <HI>Ellen∣boger</HI> Countrey; was surprized in the night, carryed away; and the said goods are restored to the former possessors.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Ysleben</HI> the <HI>1.</HI> of <HI>November, 1631.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Last weeke the Imperiall Commaunder <HI>Bunnickhousen,</HI> with his Cavalleries, fell vpon some of his Majestie of <HI>Swe∣dens</HI> forces, and defeated them in a certaine Village where they lay. On the other side the Lieutenant Generall <HI>Schass∣man,</HI> surprised three Companies of Imperiall horsemen, and vtterly defeated, yea, slew them all, some few excepted which fled into <HI>Magdenburg.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Rotenburg</HI> the <HI>8.</HI> of <HI>November.</HI> In the Country of Franconia.</HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Erfort</HI> is confirmed that since his Majestie of <HI>Swe∣den</HI> hath taken the same Citie, it is exceedingly oppressed with Garrisons, more then the Citie is able to beare. Here∣upon those of the Citie by their Committies, haue made humble sute to his Majestie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to the end they might be eased and disburdened of so intollerable a Charge.</P>
<P>His Majestie intends to send his Queene thither to reside there, whom they daily expect. Others are of opinion, that the Queene shall keepe her residence in the Castle of <HI>Wirts∣burg,</HI> which indeed is a strong and Royall Castle.</P>
<P>In all parts here abouts, are levied all Souldiers that vpon any termes will beare Armes, both horsemen and foote.</P>
<P>Two dayes agoe we heard a great thundring of shooting. Whereupon we doe presume, that the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Ar∣my, and the Generall <HI>Tillies</HI> Army, haue had some sore en∣counter neare vnto <HI>Mergenheym,</HI> which is very probable to be so.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Lausenitz</HI> the <HI>2.</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Imperiall</HI> Garrisons in <HI>Bautsen, Garlitz,</HI> and <HI>Sitta,</HI> durst in no wise expect the comming of the Duke of <HI>Saxons</HI> Army; wherefore they haue abandoned <HI>Lausenitz</HI> wholly, and haue betooke themselues into <HI>Silesia.</HI> Which indeede happened with great confusion, in so much that they were
<PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y"/>constrained (by reason of their perplexitie) vto leaue the chiefe of their Ordnance at <HI>Gorlitz.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> his Army pursued the Im∣perialists, even at the heeles, and the said <HI>Imperialists</HI> were o∣vertaken by the <HI>Saxons</HI> neare vnto <HI>Hirschbergh.</HI> But where∣as the <HI>Imperialists</HI> durst not stand to it, they were slaine by wholes troupes of them, and miserably destroyed, as doubt∣lesse you will ere long vnderstand by a more ample Relation.</P>

<HEAD>Out of <HI>Franconia</HI> the <HI>9.</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></HEAD>
<P>His Majestie as yet is resident at <HI>Wirtsburg,</HI> which he hath caused to be exceedingly fortified; in the night he takes vp his lodging in the Castle. Some of <HI>Tillyes</HI> Souldiers who are imprisoned by the <HI>Swedish,</HI> affirme, that there is exceeding great want in the Popish Army, both of Victualls and other provision. Whereupon the Souldiers doe faint, and let their courage sinke. They confesse that many impotent forces are aggregated confusedly together, but to no great purpose, neither in any good order. Neither are they able to furnish their Armie with Ordnance and Munition, &amp;c. since that horrible overthrow neare vnto <HI>Leipsich.</HI> Especially they are weakened exceedingly, because his Majestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath taken (of late) <HI>Wirtsburg,</HI> and other strong places, furnished with all manner of necessaries. And doth daily proceede in his Victorious and successefull proceedings. Whereas the <HI>Catholike League,</HI> haue not time to consult of the maine mat∣ter, much lesse to prevent the common danger and misery, which now comes flowing vpon them in full streame, but e∣very one hath enough to doe, to shift for his owne particu∣lar safetie.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Hanaw</HI> the <HI>11.</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I doubt not but you haue heard how this Citie hath beene surprized and taken by the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> forces. Giue me leaue briefly to relate it vnto you, if happily you are not ac∣quainted with the manner of it.</P>
<P>In the morning early, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1. three thousand <HI>Swedish
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>Dragoners</HI> (Musquetiers on Horsebacke) and six hundred <HI>Curassiers,</HI> came before this Citie, and entred and passed through the Kinzing gate, where they patarded the Gate be∣hinde the Castle, and scaled the wals, so that by these meanes they soone mastered the Old Citie. In this furious assault and expedition, onely eight Citizens and three Souldiers were slaine, besides some other hurt.</P>
<P>The Earle of <HI>Hanaw,</HI> (notwithstanding his Countesse was then in Labour, or at least-wise newly brought to bed of a young daughter) was presently taken in hold. And present∣ly after assaulted the New Citie furiously, and battered vpon the same with Canon shot. Those within resolved to defend themselues to the vttermost. But being threatned with sore threats, were at last willing to come to agreement, appealed to the Earle, and required his consent, who came to them vpon the walles of the Citie, and spake to them in the Citie, in this manner.</P>
<P>My faithfull and loving Citizens and Souldiers, to affoord you much Counsell in this extremitie, or any assistance, I am not able, by reason I am a prisoner. Onely this I wish you to compound and make your agreement vpon the best termes you can. Which they willingly consented vnto, and did so. And those that would betake themselues into the service of his Majestie were entertained; the rest were imprisoned. His Majestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> himselfe in person was not in this ex∣pedition, but is daily expected at <HI>Hanaw,</HI> to establish order according to his Royall Direction.</P>
<P>The forces of the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> which were enquartered at <HI>Heuxt, Hofsteym,</HI> and other places hereabout, haue aban∣doned their Garrison, and are fled to <HI>Mentz.</HI> The <HI>Swedish</HI> haue also taken <HI>Fryburgh.</HI></P>
<P>As many Forces as possibly can be are raised for the <HI>Ca∣tholicke League,</HI> in this their extreame need, and to this end divers Officers are sent into the Land of <HI>Liege,</HI> to levie some Troupes.</P>
<P>The Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> is now also about to levie an Army of 20000 men. And as we are credibly enformed, the
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y"/>Bishop of <HI>Cullen</HI> himselfe in person will come into the field with his new Army.</P>
<P>We haue ty dings that the City of <HI>Strasburgh</HI> is agreed with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> likewise <HI>Norinburgh, Ʋlme</HI> and other Cities are upon termes of composition. Colonell <HI>Re∣linger</HI> is sent to the forenamed Cities, as Commissary for his <HI>Maiestie</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to agree with them as he shall finde it consonant. The same Commissary met in his journey with a Wagon full of Spirituall Persons, neare vnto the City <HI>Vlms,</HI> all which he tooke hold of, and ransomed them afterwards for 40000 Rix-Dollars.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Swynfordt</HI> the <HI>10</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Last Wednesday his <HI>Majestie</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> with 33 Cornets of Horse, accompanied with divers Earles, and other great Lords and Peeres, departed from <HI>Wurtsburgh,</HI> and is direct∣ly gone to the Army newly levied neere vnto the City <HI>Ca∣relstadt,</HI> by the River <HI>Mayne,</HI> there to adjoyne his Troupes with them.</P>
<P>His <HI>Maiestie</HI> tooke along with him from this place, 4 Companies, and as many as he could well spare from some other places, by reason he had information that the <HI>Imperiall Forces</HI> were speedily marching toward <HI>Carelstadt,</HI> against the sayd new raised Army. They are already come neere vnto <HI>Niewstadt,</HI> and <HI>Rotten,</HI> where doubtlesse when they meete, something will be effected.</P>
<P>This City, as likewise the Castle of <HI>Wurtsburgh</HI> is much fortified. His <HI>Maiestie</HI> causeth a new Army of 40000 men to be raised, to which end, both here, and in all the adjoyning Countries the Drummes beate, and the Trumpets doe sound continually.</P>
<P>In the mean while tis a great misery that befals these Coun∣tries, and none without pitty or compassion can either be∣hold or heare of the ruines in these Parts. Men haue heavy taxations laid vpon them, and great contributions must be paid; but especially by the Clergy, which causeth both Lai∣ty and Clergy to abandon their residence, which is pilladged
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>and spoyled by the Souldiers in their absence.</P>
<P>Newly we received tydings that the whole <HI>Ʋaunt-guard</HI> of the <HI>Cavallerie</HI> of Generall <HI>Altringer</HI> is vtterly defeated, and many of them slaine. Insomuch that no lesse then 6. Cornets were brought and presented to his <HI>Maiestie</HI> of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> we shall acquaint you with the particulars the very next occasion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Torgan</HI> the <HI>9</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Imperialists</HI> not daring to abide the Encounter with the <HI>Saxon</HI> Forces, haue quite left and forsaken the six Cities in <HI>Lusatia,</HI> and are fled into <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Silesia,</HI> there if they can to defend those Countries.</P>
<P>Since that an Ambassador from his <HI>Imperiall Maiestie</HI> with a great traine of followers is arrived at <HI>Dresden,</HI> with very friendly and patheticall moving Letters to our Prince Ele∣ctor of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> which Letters sound to this effect, as name∣ly, That it never was his <HI>Imperiall Maiesties</HI> intention or will, to make the incursion into <HI>Saxonie,</HI> and that he for his part, hath no other cause (but after great experience) to be well assured of his <HI>Maiesties</HI> favour and loue: Knowing what a friend his <HI>Imperiall Maiestie</HI> hath beene to him, insomuch, that he could not expect any emnitie at his hands, onely if he would be pleased to lay downe, and abandon his Armes. But since our Elector of <HI>Saxonie</HI> sufficiently knowes his <HI>Im∣periall Maiesties</HI> disposition, by woefull proofe and experi∣ence, especially since matters are now come to this high passe, the Duke of <HI>Saxonie</HI> will not trust to his coloured protestati∣ons, but earnestly adde further proceedings to their good beginnings, and leaue the issue to the <HI>Almightie.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From <HI>Leypzich</HI> the <HI>12</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></HEAD>
<P>His Highnesse of <HI>Saxonie</HI> at this present is at <HI>Bautsen</HI> in person, but his chiefe Army is in <HI>Bohemia.</HI> The <HI>Swedish</HI> of <HI>Crossen</HI> in <HI>Silesia,</HI> haue taken great <HI>Glogaw,</HI> and slaine all the Souldiers there that made any opposition.</P>
<P>It is most certaine, that 12000 <HI>Swedish</HI> more are now speedily marching to his <HI>Maiestie</HI> about <HI>Wurtsburgh,</HI> to aug∣ment his <HI>Maiesties</HI> Army.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>From <HI>Brunswicke</HI> the <HI>13.</HI> of November.</HEAD>
<P>A few dayes agoe the Garrison of <HI>Rostocke</HI> came before this City, and required 4. dayes provision. Which by the Magistracy of the City was refused: they professed that they would cleave close to the Conclusion made at the Dyet at <HI>Leypzich.</HI></P>
<P>To the same Guarrison are adjoyued eleven Cor∣net more, whether they will now tend will ere long appeare.</P>
<P>The Earle of <HI>Gransfield</HI> is now leuying of an Army in <HI>Westphalia.</HI> He is come into the Byshopricke of <HI>Minden</HI> with the Regiment of <HI>Erwitz.</HI></P>
<P>The Commander <HI>Baninghousen</HI> Colonell of the a∣foresayd 11. troupes of horse, (besides the Garri∣sons of <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> and <HI>Wolfenbuttle</HI>) hath brought againe all places unto <HI>Halberstadt</HI> under Contribu∣tion, and those that will not contribute, he puts them to fire and sword. He hath also sorely threat∣ned <HI>Halberstadt,</HI> but whereas divers troupes of Swedish are newly come thither, he will availe but little with his enterprise. The same Commander hath pillaged 14. Wagons laden with good Com∣modities going from <HI>Hamburgh</HI> to <HI>Leypzig.</HI></P>

<P>Sixe hundred of Swedish Horse-men, marched
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>neare unto <HI>Franckfort</HI> the 13. of this Moneth.

<P>Here is great flight in this Kingdome from all

<P>The Lantgrave of <HI>Hessens</HI> forces have made short worke in <HI>Paterborne,</HI> where they found but small re∣sistance.

<P>For newes, by the Letters come this day from <HI>Ger∣many:</HI> some men have writte from <HI>Norimbergh,</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Saxonyes</HI> forces should have taken in <HI>Prague,</HI> it doth agree with that one writteth me from <HI>Hambrough,</HI> how that the D. of <HI>Saxony</HI> with his whole Army was entring into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and was within 7. leagues of <HI>Prague,</HI> (it should seeme Count <HI>Thurne</HI> was the leader of them) the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI> continues in his late conquered places, where he makes himselfe strong, and gathers in great con∣tributions
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>in the Townes and Countries therea∣bouts; <HI>Tilly</HI> hath a great number of men, but most of them unexperienced in warres: the King hath sent the Count of <HI>Solmes</HI> into <HI>Franck∣fort,</HI> to have their present resolution, whether they will take in his souldiers to Garrison; <HI>Tilly</HI> hath sent one to them to perswaded them to take in the Emperors Souldiers, they would be happy if they could refuse both and remaine neutrall and friend to both; but it seemes they must resolve the one or the other; judge you in what a predicament they live, for they would faine hold with the strongest, and that is doubtfull, so long as they have both strong Armies in the field: It should seeme, that the Bishop of <HI>Breame</HI> takes time while time is, and begins to put the Emperors Souldiers out of his Iu∣risdiction. Many doe write that the neather Circle of <HI>Saxony,</HI> will have 12000. men in the field, and the <HI>Hance</HI> Townes like to Arme them; so that by all appearance this next Summer all <HI>Germany</HI> will be up in Armes: for particular fightings, many write of many, but they are farre from hence, and therefore forbeare to write of any of them: It should seeme the <HI>French</HI> are already marching towards <HI>Italy,</HI> they say to put into Garrison; I doe believe so till the next Spring, and then will show their intents; for there is a generall opinion they will joyne with <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the next Spring goe into <HI>Italy:</HI> and make a pretended warre against <HI>Germany,</HI> and get <HI>Mil∣laine</HI> if they can; the next yeare is like to be bloo∣dy, God send a good peace to prevent so great a bloudshed as is like to be.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of another Letter of the <HI>18.</HI> of November. <HI>1631.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY Gods assistance the old Count of <HI>Thurn,</HI> com∣manding some <HI>Swedish</HI> forces and seconded by some troupes of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and accompa∣nied with many Bohemian Lords and Noble-men, that by the Emperour were banished, tooke with∣out any opposition the Metropolitan City of <HI>Prage,</HI> of whose comming as soone as the Governour of the Castle and the other of the Towne had notice, they both with many more chiefe Ministers and Of∣ficers had no mind to stay for that Earle his com∣ming, but saved themselves by flight.</P>
<P>They were followed by many Iesuites, Fryars and Priests, who all went towards <HI>Passan</HI> and into <HI>Au∣stria.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Fridland (Walsteyn)</HI> did indeed shew great displeasure at their flight. But soone af∣ter he himselfe and <HI>Don Balthazor</HI> (who commands all the milice and garisons in Bohemia) faining as if they would goe foorth to meete and parly with the said Earle of <HI>Thurne,</HI> they were no sooner out of towne but went also away as fast as they could towards <HI>Budwize.</HI> Therefore some of the Swedish Army joyning with many Bohemians, who are glad of so good an opportunity to free them∣selves againe from the insupportable yoke, both their consciences and goods are under, doe follow them, to hinder them to make any considerable Ar∣my. Almost all Townes doe openly reioyce and de∣clare for them, and so all <HI>Bohemia</HI> doth make a ge∣nerall insurrection, in manner, that wheresoever the people meetes with an Imperiall souldier, or whom they doe but suspect to be an Imperialist, they pre∣sently knocke him downe.</P>
<P>And how this new conquest doth please the Duke
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and the Emperour himselfe, may well be supposed. The said Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> being rea∣dy with about 12. thousand men to draw and march towards the Papists Army (for the Imperiall and Leaguish are ioyned into one, and <HI>Tilly</HI> doth no more appeare alive) when the newes of Bohemia did cause him to make a stand and to take new Counsell. This we understand for certaine, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Out of another Letter the <HI>14.</HI> of November.</HEAD>
<P>I Doe not doubt but you have heard that the Count of <HI>Thurne</HI> hath delivered againe both <HI>Prague</HI> and many other parts and places of <HI>Bohemia</HI> from the oppression they have sighed under these many yeres. I hope to send you by the next more particularities thereof.</P>
<P>Meanewhile I will tell you, that a friend of mine writes to me, that Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> fell so sicke the ve∣ry day of his overthrow before <HI>Leypsich,</HI> that ever since all the skill of Surgeons and Physitions could not keepe him alive. And so I am sure that hee is dead, but I cannot (as yet) tell you when and where he dyed.</P>
<P>The Roman Catholike Army, lying still for the most part betwixt the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> doe by incursions now and then great hurt therea∣bout, not against their Enemies, but onely upon the poore people, burning spoiling and sacking all whe∣ther they can come. For there is no discipline, nor order, nor Religion amongst them. They have late∣ly taken some places (of no strength) in the Marqui∣sat of <HI>Onspach,</HI> and the very towne of <HI>Onspach;</HI> yea they are not content to burne and rob the houses and the poore Countrey-people, but they have of late beene so barbarous that they have opened the Monuments and Sepulchers of the Princes and Mar∣quises
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> that governed at <HI>Onspach,</HI> and there robbed the dead and abused the corpes, which some Finlanders understanding swore to re∣venge, saying; they were but sorry to have to deale with such as durst shew no courage against them, but were onely fit to rob and boast against the dead Lyons, whom they never dare looke in the faces whilest they are alive; And that they being fitter for the gallowes then for an Army, they hoped to meet them once againe as they had lately done in their quarter neare <HI>Leypsich,</HI> where <HI>Tilly</HI> had cho∣sen his quarter due to his robbers, and where they receiued their reward.</P>
<P>Landgrave <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Hessen</HI> being come backe a∣gaine out of <HI>Paderborn</HI> to <HI>Fulda,</HI> hath brought with him thither many principall and Noble-men of that Bishoprick, as hostages, untill all the contributions agreed upon shall be payd.</P>
<P><HI>Bannier</HI> (who is now Generall commanding a Swedish Army in the Countrey of <HI>Magdenburgh</HI>) hath blocked up the said Citty, so that it is hoped he will bring the same againe into the former liber∣ty and deliver it from the Cruell Vsurpators.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Antwerp</HI> the <HI>27.</HI> of November.</HEAD>
<P>This Instant there is a good friend of ours come from <HI>Franckford</HI> post in 3. dayes, who confirmes the taking of <HI>Hanaw,</HI> and sayth that for certaine, <HI>Prague</HI> is taken, with all the Citties Townes and places thereabouts, by the Duke of <HI>Saxony.</HI> And the King of Swedlands forces are marched from <HI>Hanaw</HI> to <HI>Franckford,</HI> which undoubtedly must also yeeld vn∣to him, in fine the King of Swedland is very victo∣rious and in all possibility to conqver all <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Empire: when I have any more newes, I will not faile to perticipate it unto you.</P>
