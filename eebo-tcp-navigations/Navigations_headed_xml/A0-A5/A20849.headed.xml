<HEAD>To any that will read it.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I first vndertooke this Poeme, or as some very skilfull in this kind, haue pleased to tearme it, this Herculean labour. I was by some vertuous friends perswaded, that I should receiue much comfort and incou∣ragement therein; and for these Reasons: First, that it was a new, cleere way, neuer before gone by any; then, that it contained all the Delicacies, Delights, and Rarities of this renowned Isle, interwouen with the Histories of the Britanes, Saxons, Normans, and the later English: And further that there is scarcely any of the Nobilitie, or Gentry of this land, but that he is some way or other, by his Blood interressed therein. But it hath fallen out other∣wise; for instead of that comfort, which my noble friends (from the freedome of their Spirits) proposed as my due, I haue met with barbarous Ignorance, and base De∣traction; such a cloud hath the Deuill drawne ouer the Worlds Iudgement, whose opinion is in few yeares fallen so farre below all Ballatry, that the Lethargy is incurable; nay some of the Stationers, that had the Sel∣ling of the first part of this Poeme, because it went not so fast away in the Sale, as some of their beastly and abo∣minable Trash, (a shame both to our Language and Na∣tion) haue either despightfully left out, or at least care∣lessely neglected the Epistles to the Readers, and so haue cousoned the Buyers with vnperfected Bookes; which these that haue vndertaken the second Part, haue beene forced to amend in the first, for the small number that are yet remaining in their hands. And some of our out∣landish, vnnaturall English, (I know not how other∣wise
<PB REF="203"/>
to expresse them) sticke not to say, that there is no∣thing in this Island worthy studying for, and take a great pride to bee ignorant in any thing thereof; for these, since they delight in their folly, I wish it may be heredi∣tary from them to their posteritie, that their children may bee beg'd for Fooles to the fift Generation, vntill it may be beyond the memory of man to know that there was euer any other of their Families: neither can this de∣terre mee from going on with Scotland, if Meanes and Time doe not hinder me, to performe as much as I haue promised in my first Song:</P>
<LG>
<L>Till to the sleepy Maine, to <HI>Thuly</HI> I haue gone,</L>
<L>And seene the Frozen Isles, the cold <HI>Deucalidon,</HI></L>
<L>Amongst whose Iron Rocks, grim <HI>Saturne</HI> yet remaines,</L>
<L>Bound in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gloomy Caues with Adamantine Chaines.</L>
</LG>
<P>And as for those Cattell whereof I spake before, <HI>Odi profanum vulgus &amp; arceo,</HI> of which I account them, bee they neuer so great, and so I leaue them. To my friends, and the louers of my Labors, I wish all happinesse.</P>

<L>What can this Ile produce, that lyes from my report,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>When making for the Brooke, the Falkoner doth espie</L>
<L>On Riuer, Plash, or Mere, where store of Fowle doth lye:</L>
<L>Whence forced ouer land, by skilfull Falconers trade:</L>
<L>A faire conuenient flight, may easily be made.</L>
<L>He whistleth off his Hawkes, whose nimble pincons streight,</L>

<L>And if that after * check, the one or both doe goe, <NOTE PLACE="marg">After Pigeons, Crowes, or such like.</NOTE></L>
<L>Sometimes he them the Lure, sometimes doth water show;</L>
<L>The trembling Fowle that heare the Iigging Hawk-bels ring,</L>
<L>And find it is too late, to trust then to their wing,</L>
<L>Lye flat vpon the flood, whilst the high-mounted Hawks,</L>
<L>Then being lords alone, in their etheriall walkes,</L>
<L>Aloft so brauely stirre, their bells so thicke that shake;</L>
<L>Which when the Falkoner sees, that scarce one * plane they make: <NOTE PLACE="marg">When they sore as Kites doo.</NOTE></L>
<L>The gallant'st Birds saith he, that euer flew on wing,</L>
<L>And sweares there is a Flight, were worthy of a King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then making to the Flood, to force the Fowles to rise,</L>
<L>The fierce and eager Hawkes, downe thrilling from the Skies,</L>
<L>Make sundry * Canceleers e'r they the Fowle can reach, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Crossing the ayre in their downe-come.</NOTE></L>
<L>Which then to saue their liues, their wings doe liuely stretch.</L>
<L>But when the whizzing Bels the silent ayre doe cleaue,</L>
<L>And that their greatest speed, them vainly doe deceiue;</L>
<L>And the sharpe cruell Hawkes, they at their backs doe view,</L>
<L>Themselues for very feare they instantly * ineawe. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lay the Fowles againe into the water.</NOTE></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Hawkes get vp againe into their former place;</L>
<L>And ranging here and there, in that their ayery race:</L>
<L>Still as the fearefull Fowle attempt to scape away,</L>
<L>With many a stouping braue, them in againe they lay.</L>
<L>But when the Falkoners take their Hawking-poles in hand,</L>
<L>And crossing of the Brooke, doe put it ouer land:</L>
<L>The Hawke giues it a souse, that makes it to rebound,</L>
<L>Well neere the height of man, sometime aboue the ground;</L>
<L>Oft takes a leg, or wing, oft takes away the head,</L>
<L>And oft from necke to tayle, the backe in two doth shread.</L>

<L>To <HI>Ouze the great</HI> shee goes, her Queene that commeth crown'd,</L>
<L>As such a Riuer fits, so many miles renown'd;</L>
<L>And poynting to the North, her Christall front she dashes</L>
<L>Against the swelling sands of the surrounded Washes;</L>
<PB N="17" REF="217"/>
<L>And <HI>Neptune</HI> in her Armes, so amply doth imbrace,</L>
<L>As she would rob his Queene, faire <HI>Thetis</HI> of her place.</L>
<L>Which when rich <HI>Marsh-land</HI> sees, least she should loose her state,</L>
<L>With that faire Riuer thus, shee gently doth debate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Disdaine me not, deare Flood, in thy excessiue pride,</L>
<L>There's scarcely any soyle that sitteth by thy side,</L>
<L>Whose Turfe so batfull is, or beares so deepe a swath;</L>
<L>Nor is there any <HI>Marsh</HI> in all <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> hath</L>
<L>So many goodly seats, or that can truely show</L>
<L>Such Rarities as I: so that all <HI>Marshes</HI> owe</L>
<L>Much honor to my name, for that exceeding grace,</L>
<L>Which they receiue by me, so soueraigne in my place.</L>
<L>Though <HI>Rumney,</HI> as some say, for finenesse of her grasse,</L>
<L>And for her daintie scite, all other doth surpasse:</L>
<L>Yet are those Seas but poore, and Riuers that confine</L>
<L>Her greatnesse but meane Rills, be they compar'd with mine.</L>
<L>Nor hardly doth shee tyth th'aboundant Fowle and Fish,</L>
<L>Which Nature giues to me, as I my selfe can wish.</L>
<L>As <HI>Amphitrite</HI> oft, calls me her sweet and faire,</L>
<L>And sends the Northrene winds to curle my braided haire,</L>
<L>And makes the * <HI>Washes</HI> stand, to watch and ward me still, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Washes, lying betweene Marsh-land, and the Sea.</NOTE></L>
<L>Lest that rough god of Sea, on me should worke his will.</L>
<L>Old <HI>Wisbitch</HI> to my grace, my circuit sits within,</L>
<L>And neere my banks I haue the neighbourhood of <HI>Lyn.</HI></L>
<L>Both Townes of strength and state, my profits still that vent:</L>
<L>No <HI>Marsh</HI> hath more of Sea, none more of continent.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Marsh-land</HI> ends her speech, as one that throughly knew,</L>
<L>What was her proper praise, and what was <HI>Ouzes</HI> due.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With that the zealous Muse, in her Poetique rage,</L>
<L>To <HI>Walsingham</HI> would needs haue gone a Pilgrimage,</L>
<L>To view those farthest shores, whence little <HI>Niger</HI> flowes</L>
<L>Into the Northrene Maine, and see the gleabe where growes</L>
<L>That Saffron, (which men say) this land hath not the like,</L>
<L>All <HI>Europe</HI> that excels: but here she sayle doth strike.</L>
<L>For that <HI>Apollo</HI> pluckt her easly by the eare;</L>

</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>BY this our little rest, thus hauing gotten breath,</L>
<L>And fairely in our way, vpon <HI>Newmarket-Heath:</HI></L>
<L>That great and ancient * Ditch, which vs expected long, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diuels Ditch.</NOTE></L>
<L>Inspired by the Muse, at her arriuall song:</L>
<L>O Time, what earthly thing with thee it selfe can trust,</L>
<L>When thou in thine owne course, art to thy selfe vniust!</L>
<L>Dost thou contract with death, and to obliuion giue</L>
<L>Thy glories, after them, yet shamefully dar'st liue?</L>
<L>O Time, hadst thou preseru'd, what labouring man hath done,</L>
<L>Thou long before this day, mightst to thy selfe haue wonne</L>
<L>A Deitie with the gods, and in thy Temple plac'd,</L>
<L>But sacriligious thou, hast all great workes defac'd;</L>
<L>For though the things themselues haue suffered by thy theft,</L>
<L>Yet with their Ruines, thou, to ages mightst haue left,</L>
<L>Those Monuments who rear'd, and not haue suffred thus <NOTE PLACE="marg">The great ditch cutting <HI>Nevv∣market. Heath,</HI> beginneth at <HI>Rech,</HI> &amp; endeth at <HI>Covvlidge.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Posteritie so much, t'abuse both thee and vs.</L>
<L>I, by th' <HI>East Angles</HI> first, who from this Heath arose,</L>
<L>The long'st and largest Ditch, to check their <HI>Mercian</HI> foes;</L>
<L>Because my depth, and breadth, so strangely doth exceed,</L>
<L>Mens low and wretched thoughts, they constantly decreed,</L>
<PB N="20" REF="220"/>
<L>That by the Deuils helpe, I needs must raised be,</L>
<L>Wherefore the <HI>Deuils-Ditch</HI> they basely named me:</L>
<L>When ages long before, I bare Saint <HI>Edmonds</HI> name,</L>
<L>Because vp to my side, (some haue supposed) came</L>
<L>The Liberties bequeath'd to his more sacred Shrine.</L>
<L>Therefore my fellow <HI>Dykes,</HI> ye ancient friends of mine,</L>
<L>That out of earth were raisd, by men whose minds were great,</L>
<L>It is no maruaile, though Obliuion doe you threat.</L>
<L>First, * <HI>Flemditch</HI> next my selfe, that art of greatest strength, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alias,</HI> Seuen mile ditch, be∣ing so much in length from the East side of the riuer <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to <HI>Balsham.</HI> From <HI>Hinxston</HI> to <HI>Horsheath</HI> fiue miles. From <HI>Melburne</HI> to <HI>Fulmer,</HI> the shortest of the foure.</NOTE></L>
<L>That doest extend thy course full seauen large mile in length:</L>
<L>And thou the * <HI>Fiuemile</HI> cald, yet not lesse deare to me;</L>
<L>With * <HI>Brenditch,</HI> that againe is shortest of the three,</L>
<L>Can you suppose your selues at all to be respected,</L>
<L>When you may see my truth's bely'd, and so neglected:</L>
<L>Therefore deare <HI>Heath,</HI> liue still in prosperous estate,</L>
<L>And let thy wel-fleec'd Flocks, from morne to euening late,</L>
<L>(By carefull Shepheards kept) reioyce thee with their praise;</L>
<L>And let the merry Larke, with her delicious layes,</L>
<L>Giue comfort to thy plaines, and let me onely lye,</L>
<L>(Though of the world contemn'd) yet gracious in thine eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus said, these ancient <HI>Dykes</HI> neglected in their ground,</L>
<L>Through the sad aged earth, sent out a hollow sound,</L>
<L>To gratulate her speech; when as we met againe,</L>
<L>With one whose constant heart, with cruell loue was slaine:</L>
<L>Old <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> a Hill of long and great renowne,</L>
<L>Which neere to <HI>Cambridge</HI> set, o'rlookes that learned Towne.</L>
<L>Of <HI>Balshams</HI> pleasant hilles, that by the name was knowne,</L>
<L>But with the monstrous times, he rude and barbarous growne,</L>
<L>A Gyant was become; for man hee cared not,</L>
<L>And so the fearefull name of <HI>Gogmagog</HI> had got:</L>
<L>Who long had borne good will to most delicious <HI>Grant:</HI></L>
<L>But doubting lest some god his greatnesse might supplant.</L>
<L>For as that daintie Flood by <HI>Cambridge</HI> keepes her course,</L>
<L>He found the Muses left their old <HI>Beotian</HI> source,</L>
<L>Resorting to her banks, and euery little space,</L>
<L>He saw bright <HI>Phoebus</HI> gaze vpon her Christall face,</L>
<L>And through th'exhaled Fogs, with anger looked red,</L>
<L>To leaue his loued Nymph, when he went downe to bed.</L>
<L>Wherefore this Hill with loue, being fouly ouergone:</L>
<L>And one day as he found the louely Nymph alone,</L>
<L>Thus wooes her; Sweeting mine, if thou mine owne wilt be,</L>
<L>C'haue many a pretty gaud, I keepe in store for thee.</L>
<L>A nest of broad-fac'd Owles, and goodly Vrchins too;</L>
<L>Nay Nymph take heed of me, when I begin to wooe:</L>
<L>And better yet then this, a Bulchin twa yeares old,</L>
<L>A curld-pate Calfe it is, and oft could haue beene sold:</L>
<PB N="21" REF="220"/>
<L>And yet beside all this, c'haue goodly Beare-whelps twa,</L>
<L>Full daintie for my Ioy, when shee's dispos'd to play,</L>
<L>And twentie Sowes of Lead, to make our wedding Ring;</L>
<L>Bezides, at <HI>Sturbridge Fayre,</HI> chill buy thee many a thing:</L>
<L>Chill zmouch thee euery morne, before the Sunne can rise,</L>
<L>And looke my manly face, in thy sweet glaring eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus said, he smug'd his Beard, and stroked vp his hayre,</L>
<L>As one that for her loue he thought had offered fayre:</L>
<L>Which to the Muses, <HI>Grant</HI> did presently report,</L>
<L>Wherewith they many a yeare shall make them wondrous sport.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Ringdale</HI> in her selfe, a most delicious Dale, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vale of <HI>Ringdale,</HI> of the vulgar falsly called <HI>Ringtaile.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Who hauing heard too long the barbarous Mountaines tale,</L>
<L>Thus thinketh in her selfe, Shall I be silenc'd, when</L>
<L>Rude Hills, and Ditches, digg'd by discontented men,</L>
<L>Are ayded by the Muse; their Mind's at large to speake:</L>
<L>Besides my sister Vales supposing me but weake,</L>
<L>Iudge meanly of my state, when she ńo longer stayd,</L>
<L>But in her owne behalfe, thus to the other said.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What though betwixt two Sheeres, I be by Fortune throwne, <NOTE PLACE="marg">This Vale stan∣deth part in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> part in <HI>Cam∣bridgeshire.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>That neither of them both can challenge me her owne,</L>
<L>Yet am I not the lesse, nor lesse my Fame shall be:</L>
<L>Your Figures are but base, when they are set by me;</L>
<L>For Nature in your shapes, notoriously did erre,</L>
<L>But skillfull was in me, cast pure Orbiculer.</L>
<L>Nor can I be compar'd so like to any thing,</L>
<L>By him that would expresse my shape, as to a Ring:</L>
<L>For Nature bent to sport, and various in her trade,</L>
<L>Of all the <HI>British</HI> Vales, of me a circle made:</L>
<L>For in my very midst, there is a swelling ground,</L>
<L>About which <HI>Ceres</HI> Nymphs dance many a wanton Round.</L>
<L>The frisking Fairy there, as on the light ayre borne,</L>
<L>Oft runne at Barley-breake vpon the eares of Corne;</L>
<L>And catching drops of dew in their lasciuious chases,</L>
<L>Doe cast the liquid pearle in one anothers faces.</L>
<L>What they in largenesse haue, that beare themselues so hie,</L>
<L>In my most perfect forme, and delicacie, I,</L>
<L>For greatnesse of my graine, and finenesse of my grasse;</L>
<L>This Ilc scarce hath a Vale, that <HI>Ringdale</HI> doth surpasse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When more she would haue said, but suddenly there sprung,</L>
<L>A confident report, that through the Countrey rung,</L>
<L>That <HI>Cam</HI> her daintiest Flood, long since entituled <HI>Grant,</HI></L>
<L>Whose fountaine <HI>Ashwell</HI> crown'd, with many a vpright plant. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A famous Vil∣lage in the confines of <HI>Hartfordshire.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>In sallying on for <HI>Ouze,</HI> determin'd by the way,</L>
<L>To intertaine her friends the Muses with a Lay.</L>
<L>Wherefore to shew her selfe er'e she to <HI>Cambridge</HI> came,</L>

<L>Takes in her second head, from <HI>Linton</HI> comming in,</L>

<L>Then which, a purer Streame, a delicater Brooke,</L>
<L>Bright <HI>Phoebus</HI> in his course, doth scarcely ouerlooke.</L>
<L>Thus furnishing her bankes; as sweetly she doth glide</L>
<L>Towards <HI>Cambridge,</HI> with rich Meads layd forth on either side;</L>
<L>And with the Muses oft, did by the way conuerse:</L>
<L>Wherefore it her behooues, that something she reherse,</L>
<L>The Sisters that concern'd, who whispered in her eare,</L>
<L>Such things as onely shee, and they themselues should heare,</L>
<L>A wondrous learned Flood; and she that had been long,</L>
<L>(Though silent, in her selfe, yet) vexed at the wrong</L>
<L>Done to <HI>Apollo's</HI> Priests, with heauenly fire infused,</L>
<L>Oft by the worthlesse world, vnworthily abused:</L>
<L>With whom, in their behalfe, hap ill, or happen well,</L>
<L>Shee meant to haue a bout, euen in despight of Hell,</L>
<L>When humbly lowting low, her due obedience done,</L>

<L>(Of what degree soe'r) ye wretched worldly crue,</L>

<L>Saint <HI>Menigold,</HI> a man, who in his youth had beene</L>
<L>A Souldier, and the French, and German warres had seene,</L>
<L>A Hermit last became, his sinfull soule to saue,</L>
<L>To whom good <HI>Arnulph,</HI> that most godly Emperour gaue</L>
<L>Some ground not farre from <HI>Leedge,</HI> his Hermitage to set,</L>

<L>They to <HI>Westphalia</HI> went, and as they brothers were,</L>

<L>Th'old Pagan <HI>Saxons</HI> slew, out of their hatred deepe</L>
<L>To the true Faith, whose shrines braue <HI>Cullen</HI> still doth keepe.</L>

<L>Saint <HI>Liphard</HI> like wise to our Martyraloge shall lend,</L>

<L>The Reliques of the Saints, supposed there to bee,</L>

<L>So had we some of ours for <HI>Italy</HI> were prest,</L>

<L>When he his happy dayes religiously had spent;</L>
<L>And feeling the approch of his declining age,</L>

<LG>
<L>So Countries more remote, with ours we did acquaint,</L>
<L>As <HI>Richard</HI> for the fame his holinesse had wonne,</L>
<L>And for the wondrous things that through his Prayers were done,</L>
<L>From this his natiue home into <HI>Calabria</HI> cald,</L>
<L>And of Saint <HI>Andrewes</HI> there the Bishop was instauld,</L>

<L>That God inspired man, with heauenly goodnesse fild,</L>
<L>A Saint amongst the rest deseruedly is held.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet <HI>Italy,</HI> nor <HI>France,</HI> nor <HI>Germany,</HI> those times</L>
<L>Imployd not all our men, but into colder Clymes,</L>
<L>They wandred through the world, their Countries that forsooke.</L>
<L>So <HI>Sigfrid</HI> sent fromhence, deuoutly vndertooke</L>
<L>Those Pagans wild and rude, of <HI>Gothia</HI> to conuert,</L>
<L>Who hauing laboured long, with danger oft ingirt,</L>

<L>By <HI>Olaus</HI> King of <HI>Goths,</HI> set on <HI>Vexouia's</HI> See.</L>

<L>So <HI>Gotebald</HI> gaue himselfe holding a Christian warre</L>
<L>With Paynims, nothing else but Heathenish Rites that knew.</L>
<L>As <HI>Suethia</HI> to her selfe these men most reuerent drew,</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Vlfrid</HI> of our Saints, as famous there as any,</L>
<L>Nor scarcely find we one conuerting there so many.</L>
<L>And <HI>Henry</HI> in those dayes of <HI>Oxsto</HI> Bishop made,</L>
<L>The first that <HI>Swethen</HI> King, which cuer did perswade,</L>
<L>On <HI>Finland</HI> to make warre, to force them by the sword,</L>
<L>When nothing else could serue to heare the powerfull word;</L>
<L>With <HI>Eskill</HI> thither sent, to teach that barbarous Nation,</L>
<L>Who on the Passion day, there preaching on the Passion,</L>
<L>T'expresse the Sauiours loue to mankind, taking paine,</L>
<L>By cruell Paynims hands was in the Pulpit slaine,</L>

<PB N="87" REF="256"/>
<L>So <HI>Dauid</HI> drawne from hence into those farther parts,</L>
<L>By preaching, who to pearce those Paynims hardned hearts,</L>
<L>Incessantly proclaim'd <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> with a crie</L>
<L>Against their Heathen gods, and blind Idolatry.</L>
<L>Into those colder Clymes to people beastly rude,</L>
<L>So others that were ours couragiously pursude,</L>
<L>The planting of the Truth, in zeale three most profound,</L>
<L>The relish of whose names by likelinesse of sound,</L>
<L>Both in their liues and deaths, a likelinesse might show,</L>
<L>As <HI>Vnaman</HI> we name, and <HI>Shunaman</HI> that goe,</L>
<L>With <HI>Wynaman</HI> their friend, which martyred gladly were</L>
<L>In <HI>Gothland,</HI> whilst they taught with Christian patience there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor those from vs that went, nor those that hither came</L>
<L>From the remotest parts, were greater yet in name,</L>
<L>Then those residing here on many a goodly See,</L>
<L>(Great Bishops in account, now greater Saints that be)</L>
<L>Some such selected ones for pietie and zeale,</L>
<L>As to the wretched world, more clearely could reueale,</L>
<L>How much there might of God in mortall man be found</L>
<L>In charitable workes, or such as did abound,</L>
<L>Which by their good successe in aftertimes were blest,</L>
<L>Were then related Saints, as worthier then the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of <HI>Canterbury</HI> here with those I will begin, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishops of this land canonized Saints.</NOTE></L>
<L>That first Archbishops See, on which there long hath bin</L>
<L>So many men deuout, as rais'd that Church so high,</L>
<L>Much reuerence, and haue wonne their holy Hierarchy:</L>
<L>Of which he first that did with goodnesse so inflame</L>
<L>The hearts of the deuout (that from his proper name)</L>
<L>As one (euen) sent from God, the soules of men to saue</L>
<L>The title vnto him, of <HI>Deodat</HI> they gaue.</L>
<L>The Bishops <HI>Brightwald</HI> next, and <HI>Tatwin</HI> in we take,</L>
<L>Whom time may say, that Saints it worthily did make</L>
<L>Succeeding in that See directly euen as they,</L>
<L>Here by the Muse are plac'd, who spent both night and day</L>
<L>By doctrine, or by deeds, instructing, doing good,</L>
<L>In raising them were falne, or strengthening them that stood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>Odo</HI> the Seuere, who highly did adorne</L>
<L>That See, (yet being of vnchristened parents borne,</L>
<L>Whose Country <HI>Denmarke</HI> was, but in East <HI>England</HI> dwelt)</L>
<L>He being but a child, in his cleere bosome felt</L>
<L>The most vndoubted truth, and yet vnbaptiz'd long;</L>
<L>But as he grew in yeares, in spirit so growing strong:</L>
<L>And as the Christian faith this holy man had taught,</L>
<L>He likewise for that Faith in Sundry bartels fought.</L>
<L>So <HI>Dunstan</HI> as the rest arose through many Sees,</L>
<L>To this Arch-type at last ascending by degrees,</L>
<PB N="88" REF="257"/>
<L>There by his power confirm'd, and strongly credit wonne,</L>
<L>To many wondrous things, which he before had done.</L>
<L>To whom when (as they say) the Deuill once appear'd,</L>
<L>This man so full of faith, not once at all afeard,</L>
<L>Strong conflicts with him had, in myracles most great.</L>
<L>As <HI>Egelnoth</HI> againe much grac'd that sacred seat,</L>
<L>Who for his godly deeds surnamed was the Good,</L>
<L>Not boasting of his birth, though com'n of Royall blood:</L>
<L>For that, nor at the first, a Monkes meane Cowle despis'd,</L>
<L>With winning men to God, who neuer was suffic'd.</L>
<L>These men before exprest; so <HI>Eadsine</HI> next ensues,</L>
<L>To propagate the truth, no toyle that did refuse;</L>
<L>In <HI>Haralds</HI> time who liu'd, when <HI>William</HI> Conqueror came,</L>
<L>For holinesse of life, attain'd vnto that fame,</L>
<L>That Souldiers fierce and rude, that pitty neuer knew,</L>
<L>Were suddenly made mild, as changed in his view.</L>
<L>This man with those before, most worthily related</L>
<L>Arch-saints, as in their Sees Arch-bishops consecrated.</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> then, which <HI>Rome</HI> so much did hery,</L>
<L>As to his Christned name it added <HI>Canterbury;</HI></L>
<L>There to whose sumptuous Shrine the neere succeeding ages,</L>
<L>So mighty offrings sent, and made such Pilgrimages,</L>
<L>Concerning whom, the world since then hath spent much breath,</L>
<L>And many questions made both of his life and death:</L>
<L>If he were truely iust, he hath his right; if no,</L>
<L>Those times were much to blame, that haue him reckond so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then these from <HI>Yorke</HI> ensue, whose liues as much haue grac'd</L>
<L>That See, as these before in <HI>Canterbury</HI> plac'd:</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Wilfrid</HI> of her Saints, we then the first will bring,</L>
<L>Who twice by <HI>Egfrids</HI> ire, the sterne <HI>Northumbrian</HI> King,</L>
<L>Expulst his sacred Seat, most patiently it bare,</L>
<L>The man for sacred gifts almost beyond compare.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Bosa</HI> next to him as meeke and humble hearted,</L>
<L>As the other full of grace, to whom great God imparted</L>
<L>His mercies sundry wayes, as age vpon him came.</L>
<L>And next him followeth <HI>Iohn,</HI> who like wise bare the name,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Beuerley,</HI> where he most happily was borne,</L>
<L>Whose holinesse did much his natiue place adorne,</L>
<L>Whose Vigils had by those deuouter times bequests</L>
<L>The Ceremonies due to great and solemne Feasts.</L>
<L>So <HI>Oswald</HI> of that seat, and <HI>Cedwall</HI> sainted were,</L>
<L>Both reuerenc'd and renown'd Archbishops, liuing there</L>
<L>The former to that See, from <HI>Worcester</HI> transfer'd,</L>
<L>Deceased, was againe at <HI>Worcester</HI> inter'd:</L>
<L>The other in that See a sepucher they chose,</L>
<L>And did for his great zeale amongst the Saints dispose,</L>
<PB N="89" REF="257"/>
<L>As <HI>William</HI> by descent com'n of the Conquerors straine,</L>
<L>Whom <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> ruling here did in his time ordaine</L>
<L>Archbishop of that See, among our Saints doth fall,</L>
<L>Deria'd from those two Seats, styld Archiepiscopall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next these Arch Sees of ours, now <HI>London</HI> place doth take,</L>
<L>Which had those, of whom time Saints worthily did make.</L>
<L>As <HI>Ceda,</HI> (brother to that reuerent Bishop <HI>Chad,</HI></L>
<L>At <HI>Lichfield</HI> in those times, his famous seat that had)</L>
<L>Is Sainted for that See amongst our reuerent men,</L>
<L>From <HI>London</HI> though at length remoou'd to <HI>Lestingen,</HI></L>
<L>A monastery, which then he richly had begun.</L>
<L>Him <HI>Erkenwald</HI> ensues th'East English <HI>Offa's</HI> sonne,</L>
<L>His fathers kingly Court, who for a Crosiar sled,</L>
<L>Whose works such fame him wonne for ho linesse, that dead,</L>
<L>Time him enshrin'd in <HI>Pauls,</HI> (the mother of that See)</L>
<L>Which with Reuenues large, and Priuiledges he</L>
<L>Had wondrously endow'd; to goodnesse so affected,</L>
<L>That he those Abbayes great, from his owne power erected</L>
<L>At <HI>Chertsey</HI> neere to <HI>Thames,</HI> and <HI>Barking</HI> famous long.</L>
<L>So <HI>Roger</HI> hath a roome in these our Sainted throng,</L>
<L>Who by his words and works so taught the way to heauen,</L>
<L>As that great name to him sure was not vainely giuen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With <HI>Winchester</HI> againe proceed we, which shall store</L>
<L>Vs with as many Saints, as any See (or more)</L>
<L>Of whom we yet haue sung, (as <HI>Hcada</HI> there we haue)</L>
<L>Who by his godly life, so good instructions gaue,</L>
<L>As teaching that the way to make men to liue well,</L>
<L>Example vs assur'd, did Preaching farre excell.</L>
<L>Our <HI>Swithen</HI> then ensues, of him why ours I say,</L>
<L>Is that vpon his Feast, his dedicated day,</L>
<L>As it in Haruest haps, so Plow-men note thereby,</L>
<L>Th'ensuing fortie dayes be either wet or dry,</L>
<L>As that day falleth out, whose Myracles may wee</L>
<L>Beleeue those former times, he well might sainted bee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So <HI>Frithstan</HI> for a Saint incalendred we find,</L>
<L>With <HI>Brithstan</HI> not a whit the holyest man behind,</L>
<L>Canoniz'd, of which two, the former for respect</L>
<L>Of vertues in him found, the latter did elect</L>
<L>To sit vpon his See, who likewise dying there,</L>
<L>To <HI>Ethelbald</HI> againe succeeding did appeare,</L>
<L>The honour to a Saint, as challenging his due.</L>
<L>These formerly exprest, then <HI>Elpheg</HI> doth ensue;</L>
<L>Then <HI>Ethelwald,</HI> of whom this Almes-deed hath been told,</L>
<L>That in a time of dearth his Churches plate he sold,</L>
<L>T'releeue the needy poore; the Churches wealth (quoth he)</L>
<L>May be againe repayr'd, but so these cannot be.</L>
<PB N="90" REF="258"/>
<L>With these before exprest, so <HI>Britwald</HI> forth she brought,</L>
<L>By faith and earnest prayer his myracles that wrought,</L>
<L>That such against the Faith, that were most stony-hearted,</L>
<L>By his religious life, haue lastly been conuerted.</L>
<L>This man, when as our Kings so much decayed were,</L>
<L>As'twas suppos d their Line would be extinguisht here,</L>
<L>Had in his Dreame reueald, to whom All-doing heauen,</L>
<L>The Scepter of this land in after-times had giuen;</L>
<L>Which in Prophettick sort by him deliuered was,</L>
<L>And as he stoutly spake, it truly came to passe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So other Southerne Sees, here either lesse or more,</L>
<L>Haue likewise had their Saints, though not alike in store.</L>
<L>Of <HI>Rochester,</HI> we haue Saint <HI>Ithamar,</HI> being then</L>
<L>In those first times, first of our natiue <HI>English</HI> men</L>
<L>Residing on that Seat; so as an ayd to her,</L>
<L>But singly Sainted thus, we haue of <HI>Chichester,</HI></L>
<L>Saint <HI>Richard,</HI> and with him Saint <HI>Gilbert,</HI> which doe stand</L>
<L>Enrold amongst the rest of this our Mytred Band,</L>
<L>Of whom such wondrous things, for truths deliuered are,</L>
<L>As now may seeme to stretch <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strait beleefe too farre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And <HI>Cimbert,</HI> of a Saint had the deserued right,</L>
<L>His yearely <HI>Obijts</HI> long, done in the Isle of <HI>Wight;</HI></L>
<L>A Bishop, as some say, but certaine of what See,</L>
<L>It scarcely can be proou'd, nor is it knowne to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whilst <HI>Sherburne</HI> was a See, and in her glory shone,</L>
<L>And <HI>Bodmin</HI> likewise had a Bishop of her owne,</L>
<L>Whose Diocesse that time contained <HI>Cornwall;</HI> these</L>
<L>Had as the rest their Saints, deriued from their Sees:</L>
<L>The first, her <HI>Adelme</HI> had, and <HI>Hamond,</HI> and the last</L>
<L>Had <HI>Patrock,</HI> for a Saint that with the other past;</L>
<L>That were it fit for vs but to examine now</L>
<L>Those former times, these men for Saints that did allow,</L>
<L>And from our reading vrge, that others might as well</L>
<L>Related be for Saints, as worthy euery deale.</L>
<L>This scruteny of ours, would cleere that world thereby,</L>
<L>And shew it to be voyd of partiality,</L>
<L>That each man holy cald, was not canoniz'd here,</L>
<L>But such whose liues by death had triall many a yeere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That See at <HI>Norwich</HI> now establisht (long not stird)</L>
<L>At <HI>Eltham</HI> planted first, to <HI>Norwich</HI> then transferd</L>
<L>Into our bedroule here, her <HI>Humbert</HI> in doth bring,</L>
<L>(A Counsellour that was to that most martyred King</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Edmund</HI>) who in their rude massacre then slaine,</L>
<L>The title of a Saint, his Martyrdome doth gaine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So <HI>Hereford</HI> hath had on her Cathedrall Seat,</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Leofgar,</HI> a man by Martyrdome made great,</L>
<PB N="91" REF="258"/>
<L>Whom <HI>Griffith</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> that sowne which did subdue,</L>
<L>(O most vnhallowed deed) vnmercifully slue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So <HI>Worster,</HI> (as those Sees here sung by vs before)</L>
<L>Hath likewise with her Saints renown'd our natiue shore:</L>
<L>Saint <HI>Egwin</HI> as her eld'st, with <HI>Woolstan</HI> as the other,</L>
<L>Of whom she may be proud, to say shee was the Mother,</L>
<L>The Churches Champions both, for her that stoutly stood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Lichfield</HI> hath those no whit lesse famous, nor lesse good:</L>
<L>The first of whom is that most reuerent Bishop <HI>Chad,</HI></L>
<L>In those religious times for holinesse that had,</L>
<L>The name aboue the best that liued in those dayes,</L>
<L>That Stories haue been stuft with his abundant praise;</L>
<L>Who on the See of <HI>Yorke</HI> being formerly instauld,</L>
<L>Yet when backe to that place Saint <HI>Wilfrid</HI> was recald,</L>

<L>For that the barbarous <HI>Danes</HI> he brauely did withstand,</L>

<L>Cleere <HI>Wytham</HI> in her course, me fairely doth diuide</L>
<L>From <HI>Holland;</HI> and from thence the <HI>Fosdyke</HI> is my bound,</L>
<L>Which our first <HI>Henry</HI> cut from <HI>Lincolne,</HI> where he found,</L>
<L>Commodities by <HI>Trent,</HI> from <HI>Humber</HI> to conuay:</L>
<L>So Nature, the cleere <HI>Trent</HI> doth fortunatly lay,</L>
<L>To ward me on the West, though farther I extend,</L>
<L>And in my larger bounds doe largely comprehend</L>
<L>Full <HI>Axholme,</HI> (which those neere, the fertile doe instile)</L>
<L>Which <HI>Idle, Don,</HI> and <HI>Trent,</HI> imbracing make an Isle.</L>

<LG>
<L>But wherefore of my Bounds, thus onely doe I boast,</L>
<L>When that which <HI>Holland</HI> seemes to vaunt her on the most,</L>
<L>By me is ouermatcht; the Fowle which shee doth breed:</L>
<L>Shee in her foggy Fennes, so moorishly doth feed,</L>
<L>That Phisick oft forbids the Patient them for food,</L>
<L>But mine more ayrie are, and make fine spirits and blood:</L>
<L>For neere this batning Isle, in me is to be seene,</L>
<L>More then on any earth, the <HI>Plouer</HI> gray, and greene,</L>
<L>The Corne-land-louing <HI>Quayle,</HI> the daintiest of our bits,</L>
<L>The <HI>Rayle,</HI> which seldome comes, but vpon Rich mens spits:</L>
<L>The <HI>Puet, Godwit, Stint,</HI> the pallat that allure,</L>
<L>The Miser and doe make a wastfull Epicure:</L>
<L>The <HI>Knot,</HI> that called was <HI>Canutus</HI> Bird of old,</L>
<L>Of that great King of <HI>Danes,</HI> his name that still doth hold,</L>
<L>His apetite to please, that farre and neere was sought,</L>
<L>For him (as some haue sayd) from <HI>Denmarke</HI> hither brought</L>
<PB N="113" REF="271"/>
<L>The <HI>Dotterell,</HI> which we thinke a very daintie dish,</L>
<L>Whose taking makes such sport, as man no more can wish;</L>
<L>For as you creepe, or cowre, or lye, or stoupe, or goe,</L>
<L>So marking you (with care) the Apish Bird doth doe,</L>
<L>And acting euery thing, doth neuer marke the Net,</L>
<L>Till he be in the Snare, which men for him haue set.</L>
<L>The big-boan'd <HI>Bustard</HI> then, whose body beares that size,</L>
<L>That he against the wind must runne, e're he can rise:</L>
<L>The <HI>Shouler,</HI> which so shakes the ayre with saily wings,</L>
<L>That euer as he flyes, you still would thinke he sings.</L>
<L>These Fowles, with other Soyles, although they frequent be,</L>
<L>Yet are they found most sweet and delicate in me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus whilst shee seemes t'extoll in her peculiar praise,</L>
<L>The Muse which seem'd too slacke, in these too low-pitcht layes,</L>
<L>For nobler height prepares, her oblique course, and casts</L>
<L>A new Booke to begin, an end of this shee hasts.</L>

<HEAD>THE ARGVMENT.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>Three Shires at once this Song assayes,</L>
<L>By various and vnvsuall wayes.</L>
<L>At <HI>Nottingham</HI> first comming in,</L>
<L>The Vale of <HI>Beuer</HI> doth begin;</L>
<L>Tow'rds <HI>Lester</HI> then her course shee holds,</L>
<L>And sayling o'r the pleasant <HI>Oulds,</HI></L>
<L>Shee fetcheth <HI>Soare</HI> downe from her Springs,</L>
<L>By <HI>Charnwood,</HI> which to <HI>Trent</HI> shee brings,</L>
<L>Then showes the Braueries of that Flood,</L>
<L>Makes <HI>Sherwood</HI> sing her <HI>Robin Hood;</HI></L>
<L>Then rouzes vp the aged <HI>Peake,</HI></L>
<L>And of her Wonders makes her speake:</L>
<L>Thence <HI>Darwin</HI> downe by <HI>Darby</HI> tends,</L>
<L>And at her fall, to <HI>Trent,</HI> it ends.</L>
</LG>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>NOw scarcely on this Tract the Muse had entrance made,</L>
<L>Enclining to the South, but <HI>Beuers</HI> batning Slade</L>
<L>Receiueth her to Guest, whose comming had too long</L>
<L>Put off her rightfull praise, when thus her selfe she sung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Three Shires there are (quoth she) in me their parts that claime,</L>
<L>Large <HI>Lincolne, Rutland</HI> Rich, and th'Norths Eye <HI>Nottingham.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vale of <HI>Beuer</HI> bordreth vpon 3. Shires.</NOTE></L>
<L>But in the last of these since most of me doth lye,</L>
<L>To that my most-lou'd Shire my selfe I must apply.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not <HI>Eusham</HI> that proud Nymph, although she still pretend</L>
<L>Her selfe the first of Vales, and though abroad she send <NOTE PLACE="marg">Not a more pleasant Vale in all great <HI>Britaine,</HI> then <HI>Beuer.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>Her awfull dread Command, that all should tribute pay</L>
<L>To her as our great Queene; nor <HI>White-horse,</HI> though her Clay</L>
<L>Of siluer seeme to be, new melted, nor the Vale</L>
<L>Of <HI>Alsbury,</HI> whose grasse seemes giuen out by tale,</L>
<L>For it so Silken is, nor any of our kind,</L>
<L>Or what, or where they be, or howsoere inclind,</L>
<PB N="116" REF="274"/>
<L>Me <HI>Beuer</HI> shall out braue, that in my state doe scorne,</L>
<L>By any of them all (once) to be ouerborne,</L>
<L>With theirs, doe but compare the Country where I lye,</L>
<L>My <HI>Hill,</HI> and <HI>Oulds</HI> will say, they are the Islands eye.</L>
<L>Consider next my Scite, and say it doth excell;</L>
<L>Then come vnto my Soyle, and you shall see it swell,</L>
<L>With euery Grasse and Graine, that <HI>Britaine</HI> forth can bring:</L>
<L>I challenge any Vale, to shew me but that thing</L>
<L>I cannot shew to her, (that truly is mine owne)</L>
<L>Besides I dare thus boast, that I as farre am knowne,</L>
<L>As any of them all, the South their names doth sound,</L>
<L>The spacious North doth mee, that there is scarcely found</L>
<L>A roomth for any else, it is so fild with mine,</L>
<L>Which but a little wants of making me diuine:</L>
<L>Nor barren am of Brookes, for that I still reteine</L>
<L>Two neat and daintie Rills, the little <HI>Snyte,</HI> and <HI>Deane,</HI></L>
<L>That from the louely <HI>Oulds,</HI> their beautious parent sprong</L>
<L>From the <HI>Lecestrian</HI> fields, come on with me along,</L>
<L>Till both within one Banke, they on my North are meint,</L>
<L>And where I end, they fall, at <HI>Newarck,</HI> into <HI>Trent.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence wandring as the Muse delightfully beholds</L>
<L>The beautie of the large, and goodly full-flockd <HI>Oulds,</HI></L>
<L>Shee on the left hand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> old <HI>Lecester,</HI> and flyes,</L>
<L>Vntill the fertile earth glut her insatiate eyes,</L>
<L>From Rich to Richer still, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her before,</L>
<L>Vntill shee come to cease vpon the head of <HI>Soare,</HI></L>
<L>Where * <HI>Fosse,</HI> and <HI>Watling</HI> cut each other in their course</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="marg">The 2. famous Wayes of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> See to the 13. Song.</NOTE> At * <HI>Sharnford,</HI> where at first her soft and gentle sourse,</L>
<L>To her but shallow Bankes, beginneth to repayre,</L>
<L>Of all this beautious Isle, the delicatest ayre;</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="marg">A little Village at the rising of <HI>Soare.</HI></NOTE> Whence softly sallying out, as loath the place to leaue,</L>
<L>Shee <HI>Sence</HI> a pretty Rill doth courteously receiue:</L>
<L>For <HI>Swift,</HI> a little Brooke, which certainly shee thought</L>
<L>Downe to the Banks of <HI>Trent,</HI> would safely her haue brought,</L>
<L>Because their natiue Springs so neerely were allyde,</L>
<L>Her sister <HI>Soare</HI> forsooke, and wholly her applide</L>
<L>To <HI>Auon,</HI> as with her continually to keepe,</L>
<L>And wayt on her along to the <HI>Sabrinian</HI> deepe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus with her hand-mayd <HI>Sence,</HI> the <HI>Soare</HI> doth eas'ly slide</L>
<L>By <HI>Lecester,</HI> where yet her ruines show her pride,</L>
<L>Demolisht many yeares, that of the great foundation</L>
<L>Of her long buried walls, men hardly see the station;</L>
<L>Yet of some pieces found, so sure the Cyment locks</L>
<L>The stones, that they remaine like perdurable rocks:</L>
<L>Where whilst the louely <HI>Soare,</HI> with many a deare imbrace,</L>
<L>Is solacing her selfe with this delightfull place,</L>
<PB N="117" REF="274"/>
<L>The Forrest, which the name of that braue Towne doth beare, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lecester</HI> Forrest.</NOTE></L>
<L>With many a goodly wreath, crownes her disheueld hayre,</L>
<L>And in her gallant Greene, her lusty Liuery showes</L>
<L>Her selfe to this faire Flood, which mildly as shee flowes,</L>
<L>Reciprocally likes her length and breadth to see,</L>
<L>As also how shee keepes her fertile purlues free:</L>
<L>The Herds of Fallow Deere shee on the Launds doth feed,</L>
<L>As hauing in her selfe to furnish euery need.</L>
<L>But now since gentle <HI>Soare,</HI> such leasure seemes to take,</L>
<L>The Muse in her behalfe this strong defence doth make,</L>
<L>Against the neighbour floods, for that which tax her so,</L>
<L>And her a Channell call, because she is so slow.</L>
<L>The cause is that shee lyes vpon so low a Flat,</L>
<L>Where nature most of all befriended her in that,</L>
<L>The longer to enioy the good she doth possesse:</L>
<L>For had those (with such speed that forward seeme to presse)</L>
<L>So many dainty Meads, and Pastures theirs to be,</L>
<L>They then would wish themselues to be as slow as she,</L>
<L>Who well may be compar'd to some young tender Mayd,</L>
<L>Entring some Princes Court, which is for pompe arayd,</L>
<L>Who led from roome to roome amazed is to see <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Simily of <HI>Soare.</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>The furnitures and states, which all Imbroyderies be,</L>
<L>The rich and sumptuous Beds, with Tester-couering plumes,</L>
<L>And various as the Sutes, so various the persumes,</L>
<L>Large Galleries, where piece with piece doth seeme to striue,</L>
<L>Of Pictures done to life, Landskip, and Perspectiue,</L>
<L>Thence goodly Gardens sees, where Antique Statues stand</L>
<L>In Stone and Copper, cut by many a skilfull hand,</L>
<L>Where euery thing to gaze, her more and more entices,</L>
<L>Thinking at once shee sees a thousand Paradices,</L>
<L>Goes softly on, as though before she saw the last,</L>
<L>She long'd againe to see, what she had slightly past.</L>
<L>So the enticing Soyle the <HI>Soare</HI> along doth lead,</L>
<L>As wondring in her selfe, at many a spacious Mead;</L>
<L>When <HI>Charnwood</HI> from the rocks salutes her wished sight,</L>
<L>(Of many a Wood-god woo'd) her darling and delight,</L>
<L>Whose beautie whilst that <HI>Soare</HI> is pawsing to behold</L>
<L>Cleere <HI>Wreakin</HI> comming in, from <HI>Waltham</HI> on the <HI>Ould,</HI></L>
<L>Brings <HI>Eye,</HI> a pretty Brooke, to beare her siluer traine,</L>
<L>Which on by <HI>Melton</HI> make, and tripping o'r the Plaine,</L>
<L>Here finding her surpriz'd with proud <HI>Mount-Sorrels</HI> sight,</L>
<L>By quickning of her Course, more eas'ly doth inuite</L>
<L>Her to the goodly <HI>Trent,</HI> where as she goes along</L>

<L>How <HI>Elne</HI> vpon the South, in sallying to the Sea</L>
