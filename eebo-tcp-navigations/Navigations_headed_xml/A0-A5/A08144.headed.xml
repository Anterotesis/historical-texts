<HEAD>Extract of the Answer of his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> GVSTAVUS ADOLPHVS. Sent to his Imperiall Majestie, concerning this present Warre.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mightie, most Illustrious Emperour, loving Kinsman and Friend.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Ee haue recei<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d your Letter at our Army at <HI>Rubenitz</HI> Whereby wee vnderstand, that your Majesty seemes greatly to admite at our invasion in∣to the Empire, this fore-passed Sum∣mer with our Army. Also you im∣pute the cause of this combustion of warre wholly vnto Vs.</P>
<P>We had not thought that your Memory could so much haue failed your Maiesty, as to put in Obliuion so many attempts lately undertaken against vs. For ex∣ample, how your field-marshall came vpon vs in <HI>Prussia</HI> with a compleat army both of Horse and Foote, your Eagl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Ensignes displayed, &amp; that vnexpectedly. Besides many <HI>iniuries</HI> more plodded against vs as is manifest and notified in all places and knowne of all men. Insomuch that you cannot accuse vs to be the occasion or cause of this warre enterprised. For necessity compells vs to as¦sure our owne State at this present, and to wage battaile and raise forces for our owne surety and safety.</P>
<P>Wherefore it must of necessity follow, that wee are
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> excusable in this matter. The rather because wee haue made knowne in writing, at two seuerall times, as also declared through our Embassadors, both to the Electors of the Empire &amp; your Generals, that in case these intol∣lerable Injuries, &amp; enimicitiall abuses did not cease, nor were remedied we should necessarily be constrained, by other lawfull meanes to disburden our selues, and ensure our selues and our estate. For it is easily to be guessed at, what your warlike preparations doe tend too, euen by your daily enterprises. Also the Countrey of <HI>Po∣merania</HI> and those Prouinces, by wofull experience can too to well testifie, by their excessiue losse and suf∣fering, what may be expected from your proceeding, although we had neuer ey'd the matter.</P>
<P>If your Imperiall Maiestie obiect, that these differen∣ces might haue beene moderated and allayed, without such miserable turmoiles and warlike proceeding, wee cannot but willingly grant; But euen then, and vpon that occasion you dismissed and reiected out Commit∣ties and Deputies against all right, reason, and modesty, when they appeared at the City of <HI>Lubeck.</HI> For than we were fully resolued to end all manner of dissention, and to come to an accord and honest agrement.</P>
<P>Besides all this, your owne Army hath proclaimed vs, (or at least) declared vs open Enemies, because they shewed all manner of hostility, and manifest enmity a∣gainst vs and ours. As for the present, true it is, you profer vs a treatie of peace (conditionally that we will abandon and lay downe our Armes) when as now the wound is growne incurable, and the rent is torne so great, that 'tis past mending. For now we cannot any longer esteeme of these emminent dangers, as meere
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> imaginations and fantasies, but must be sensible of reall injuries, when as both by Sea and Land We are palpa∣bly assaulted, and groane vnder these kind of grievan∣ces. Wherefore you shall excuse Vs, that Wee will no longer trust to your meerely Verball promises, but are resolued to entertaine and keepe our Armies in our owne hands, so long till we shall be assured of a faire Peace, and faithfull agreement.</P>
<P>If therefore in the meane time you shall resolue, and deeme fitting (as in your writing you doe intimate) to afford all your endeavour and best ayde and assistance toward the conducting of the Barque of whole Chri∣stendome (which now a long time hath beene tossed on the waues of Warre and turbulencie) to the hauen of Peace and tranquilitie, and to that end enter in a Treaty of consonant agreement, You shall find Vs no way re∣fractorie, but in euery kind most tractable and inclining to so desireable and wholesome expedition.</P>
<P>Adde herevnto, that put the case, you will be pleased to restore and re-establish our mainly respected friends, loving brothers in Law, Cousins, Vncles, aliants, friends Neighbours, Peeres and States of <HI>Germany,</HI> into the for∣mer state and constitution, in which they were seated, before the rising and combustion of this Warre began; that also furthermore, all injuries dammages and losses which Wee so grieuously of late haue sustained, may be reasonably considered and brought to a faire composi∣tion, then will Wee fully resolue, to contract a Peace with you and all your neare adjoyning Neighbors, and faithfully performe and keepe the same. In the meane while, be you recommended to the Diuine protection?</P>

<HEAD>Here followes the relation of the severall vi∣ctories, and victorious proceedings, which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> lately hath (by Gods great assistance obtained) with all the parti∣cularities and circumstances.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Copy of a Letter written from <HI>Berlyn,</HI> concerning all what passed betweene the King of <HI>Sweden Gu∣stavus Adolphus,</HI> and the Emperour his Ar∣my, from the <HI>1.</HI> of Ian: to the <HI>12.</HI></HEAD>
<P>VVHerea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Imperialists had commanded great For∣ces from their Army at <HI>Gartz,</HI> for to releeue the Ci∣ty <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>berge<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which was then Blocqued vp, and the same For∣ces were driuen backe and preuented by the Feild Marshall of the King of <HI>Sweden. Gustavus Hoorn.</HI> His Majestie consulted and resolued vpon, to visite the Imperialists in their owne quar∣ters. To this end, his Majestie commanded his Forces of <HI>Stargart, Groffenbarg<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> and other places, and tooke his Ren∣devous at <HI>Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime,</HI> situated a mile from <HI>Statyn.</HI> Whence his Majestie marched forth with an Army of 16000. foote and 86. Cornet of horse very well mounted, hauing along with them 80. peeces of Ordnance: also downe the Riuer <HI>Oder,</HI> he sent 8. great flat bottom boates, with each of them foure Demicanons. With this strong Army he came at the strong passage <HI>Griffen∣hagen,</HI> which is three small miles from <HI>Statyn.</HI> In the Citie <HI>Griffenhagen</HI> was Governour, a certaine <HI>Spaniard, Don Ca∣pua.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> his Majestie caused Sermons to bee preached <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hroughout the whole Army, and all the Soldiers to be earnestly stirred vp, to call vpon God for assistance and victo∣ry, being Gods owne cause which they went about to main∣taine.
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> His Majestie himselfe in person, did call vpon his Com∣manders, Officers and common boldiers, wishing them to be of good cheere, and to fight couragiously in so good a Cause, with arguments mouing them therevnto.</P>
<P>Herevpon his Maiestie caused 10. Demicanons, to be plan∣ted vpon the place of Execution, which is somewhat a high Hill without the City. These Demicanons playd without in∣termission vpon the City, from 9. of the clocke in the mor∣ning, vntill two of the clocke in the afternoone; by which time they made a great breach in the wall of the said City. Wherevpon the Soldiers ran furiously through the breach into the City, and mastered the same, so that they presently flew 200. soldiers, and tooke 140. of them Prisoners, amongst them was also taken <HI>Don Capua,</HI> who was shot in his thigh. Also Major <HI>Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onius,</HI> and <HI>Don Joseph,</HI> the younger Earle of <HI>Turn,</HI> with many Captaines, Commanders and Officers, were taken Prisoners in this surprizall. The rest of the Garrison, in∣stantly cast downe their Armes, and craued for qua<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, which was graciously granted them, some of them saued themselues by flight. In the City were found 8. Peeces of Ordnance. The Garrison consisted in all of horse and foote 2500 men. In this hot skyrmish the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> lost no more but 6. men, but many more were hurt and maimed.</P>
<P>The fifth of <HI>January,</HI> his Maiestie sent his Army to the strong Sconce called <HI>Morewitz,</HI> which lyes ouer against <HI>Gartz,</HI> thinking that the Imperialists, rather than they would loose that Sconce, being a place of so great importance, would af∣ford and wage battaile; for this his Maiestie aimed at at the the first, thinking to allure the enemy to battaile. But God omnipotent did apparantly fight himselfe for the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> and his Armie. And caused such feare and perplexi∣tie to possesse the Enemies, that they fled and abandon<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their weapons and Armes at the very fight of a few horse∣men which his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> commanded toward the foresaid sconce. Insomuch, that the Imperialists did not make one shot.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>Thus it happened also, at the taking of <HI>Gartz,</HI> which City of <HI>Gartz</HI> the Enemie burnt downe to the ground, except fiue houses and the Custome-house, and the Church, leauing be∣hind all their Armes, 8. pieces of Ordnance, much Munition and Prouision. But they cast some Ordnance and munition into the Riuer <HI>Oder.</HI></P>
<P>This was all couragiously performed by the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI> as shall appeare in the sequell. For as soone as his Maie∣stie had gained these places hee earnestly and speedily pur∣sued his Enemies at the very heele, on both sides of the Ri∣uer <HI>Oder.</HI></P>
<P>His Maiestie in his owne person, with an Army marched toward <HI>Coninxbergen,</HI> and his Feeld-Marshall <HI>Gustavus Hoorn,</HI> with other Forces to <HI>Custerin Franckfort,</HI> and <HI>Lantz∣bergen.</HI> In this persuit they slew many of their dispersed E∣nemies, and many of them in the flight were drowned: E∣specially, about <HI>Bardeward,</HI> and the <HI>Custerine Damm.</HI> The Crabates are most of them massacred; insomuch, that hardly any are escaped, but the <HI>Dutch</HI> obtained quarter.</P>
<P>In <HI>Peritz</HI> were in Garrison, 1400. horsemen, which also most of them were slaine by the Commander <HI>Banditz,</HI> neare vnto <HI>Coninxbergen.</HI> This City <HI>Coninxbergen</HI> his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> tooke easily, for those of the City brought him the Keyes of the Gates, and layd them downe at his feete.</P>
<P>Vpon the 8. of Ianuary, his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> pitched his Army neare vnto the Pallace or Fort called <HI>Lubbs,</HI> which is within a Mile of <HI>Franckeford</HI> by <HI>Oder.</HI></P>
<P>The Imperiall Regiments, namely some <HI>Saxons, Gotish, Swertenhallish,</HI> and other were constrained thereabout to leaue behind them aboue 1000. Wagons. 30. peeces of Ordnance, Bag and Baggage, with 14. Ensignes. Onely the Generall <HI>Spaer</HI> saued himselfe within <HI>Custerin,</HI> with three Waggons and some Baggage, how safe he is there, we shall hereafter vn∣derstand.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>In this prosecution of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Imperialists fired the little City <HI>Britzen</HI> with the Cloister which is there. Those Imperialists that are neere vnto <HI>Colbergen,</HI> and <HI>Grip∣swalde,</HI> are now depriued of all manner of reliefe and assistance, there being no meanes for any helpe to come to them; for his Maiestie hath cleered and freed the whole Countrey therea∣bouts, euen from <HI>Pruysia</HI> to the <HI>Oder</HI> and <HI>Warts,</HI> and the whole Prouince of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and also of <HI>Mark-land.</HI> Hee causeth now a very strong Sconce to be raised neere vnto <HI>Custerin,</HI> and shortly shall another be raised neerer vnto <HI>Silesia,</HI> so that hee also will assure himselfe and cleare those passages.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Meyssen <HI>20.</HI> Dito.</HEAD>
<P>The dispersed Army of his Emperiall Maiestie assembleth a∣gaine together, and make their march toward <HI>Frankford.</HI> Vnto them General <HI>Tilly</HI> resorts and adioynes his forces. Vnto whose Army the tenth of this moneth 8. Companies of the <HI>Badish</HI> Re∣giment were added and arriued at <HI>Brandenburgh.</HI> The said Ge∣nerall <HI>Tilly</HI> expects also an addition of the Regiment of <HI>Don Balthazzar,</HI> and also two Scottish Regiments; but by all probabilities, scarcity, and penury, and hunger will surely pu∣nish them. Insomuch that very likely they will be preuented of their enterprize.</P>
<P>It was lately related, but that relation is now seconded, that <HI>Zantsberghen</HI> also, after it had beene besieged but three dayes, is with agreement yeelded vp vnto his Maiestie of <HI>Swe∣den.</HI> The Imperiall Garrison did first free the Suburbs, or <HI>Fore∣stadt,</HI> and afterward when with appointment they had deliue∣red vp the towne, they marched with the Commander <HI>Cratz</HI> toward <HI>Silesia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From Leypsich the <HI>20.</HI> dito.</HEAD>
<P>The Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> the 20. of this moneth arriu'd at <HI>Har∣mundt</HI> within 4. miles of <HI>Berlyng</HI> with fine Regiments of foote and two of horse; hee bends his course toward <HI>Franckford</HI> to adioyne himselfe to the dispersed Imperialists. His Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath hereupon commanded his field-marshall <HI>Gusta∣vus Horn</HI> to march with some forces toward <HI>Silesia,</HI> hauing a reasonable Army consisting of both horse and foote. Now
<PB REF="6"/> comes certaine tidings, that his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath vtterly defeated Generall <HI>Tilly,</HI> and beat him quite out of field, his Army now also being dispersed, as were those distressed Im∣perialists which he went to assist and fortifie. The particulari∣ties of this exploit we shall heare at large hereafter.</P>
<P>Heere is also good intelligence come lately, that those of <HI>Maghdenburgh</HI> who were very strong, fell out of the City with 5000. men and raised the quarter of Earle <HI>Wolf. Mansfield,</HI> slaine abundance of his men and taken the Earle himselfe pri∣soner. Wee vnderstand from <HI>Breslau,</HI> that great preparation and fortifications are made at <HI>Great-Glogan,</HI> and that men are busied with all expedition to raise diuers Sconces there, to which end many houses are pulled downe to the ground.</P>

<HEAD>From Hamburgh the <HI>27.</HI> of Ianuary.</HEAD>
<P>Yesterday was writing receiued here from the Imperialists from <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> which affirmed that <HI>Francford Oder</HI> is also taken by the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> the truth thereof is very probable by the relation of the circumstances; for it seems that the Citizens vnderstanding the comming of his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> they all betooke themselues to their armes, which the Imperialists perceiuing, they durst no longer trust them, but departed thence and marched ouer the bridge toward <HI>Silesia,</HI> so that at the comming of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the City was de∣liuered vp into his hands. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath in person himselfe beene at <HI>Custerin</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Before <HI>Maghdenburgh</HI> at this present lay no more forces but onely the Regiment of the generall <HI>Holck,</HI> and some forces which from <HI>Papenheim</HI> were commanded thither, insomuch that now the said City is quite at liberty and free.</P>

<P>We feare here that we shall fall into new troubles and com∣bustion againe; for the Duke of <HI>Nieuburgh</HI> hath promised the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> that he will permit the Protestants free exer∣cise of Religion. Wherevpon vpon New-yeares Eeue last about sixe of the clocke certaine Protestants being assembled toge∣ther at <HI>Bracht</HI> in <HI>Amptbrugge</HI> were surprized, the Preacher and master of the house were imprisoned close, and their feete

<HEAD>Contents of a Letter written from Leypsich, wherein is com∣prized the whole summe of the good successe of the King of Sweden.</HEAD>
<P>The great successe and admirable victory which it hath plea∣sed God to afford vnto his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> is now fully con∣firmed from all parts. That at the taking of <HI>Griffenhagen</HI> and <HI>Gartz,</HI> his Maiestie hath obtained aboue 60. pieces of Ordnance and much munition, it is much to be admired that the Imperiall Army neere vnto <HI>Gartz,</HI> did not bid the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Army head, since they were 15000. strong. They fired the store∣house of prouision and munition.</P>
<P>His Maiestie of <HI>Swedens</HI> Army be 86 Coronet horse and 18 Regiment of foote, followed them those in their flight, and so closely stopt vp the passage neere <HI>Lantsberghen,</HI> so that the Im∣perialists could not retire toward <HI>Silesia,</HI> but were constrained to betake themselues againe toward <HI>Custein.</HI> Where they were vtterly disioynted, and put to disorder, and constrained to flie, leauing behind them Bagge and Baggage and many hundred waggons; and not few of them slaine and wounded. Many of them fled into <HI>Francfort,</HI> which City is also hath taken. <HI>Lantsberghen</HI> also is incorporated by the <HI>Swedish;</HI> there also the Imperialists fired the Storehouse of munition. The Gentry and country people in <HI>Marck</HI> haue done great exploits for the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> neere vnto <HI>Custrin,</HI> and <HI>Ʋogelstangh.</HI> They haue slaine all the <HI>Crabates,</HI> and of them obtained great bootie, both moneys and booty. In the space of 3. houres they tooke at least 300. wagons. The <HI>Silesian</HI> forces, vnder the command of Generall <HI>Scaffgotzy;</HI> neare vnto <HI>Custrin</HI> passed the <HI>Oder,</HI> but were constrained to forsake and leaue their Baggage and prouision, he himselfe with the commander <HI>Keraus</HI> was taken prisoner, and the speech goes that <HI>Monte Cuculye</HI> is also taken, but we haue no certainty of that. By meanes of this great vi∣ctory the Imperialists are quite expelled out of the Land of <HI>Marck.</HI> Three dayes since the <HI>Maagdenburghers</HI> made an
<PB REF="7"/> excursion, and haue slaine (as it is confidently reported) to the number of 800. of the enemies forces. Those of <HI>Maagden∣burgh,</HI> brought into the City 800 sheepe, and 76 Bullockes without any opposition or resistance; they haue incorporated also the Village <HI>Presten</HI> neere <HI>Delue</HI> into their fortifications. The same is in briefe confirmed and verified from <HI>Statin</HI> the twenty one, how that his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> in 8 dayes space accomplished by Gods great helpe this vnexpected and almost vnheard of most victorious proceeding, in the which he tooke many Cities, defeated and slaine many of the enemies forces; ta∣ken many great and chiefe commanders Prisoners, dispersed all their troupes, and cleared whole <HI>Pomerania, Mark-landt,</HI> and all the country from <HI>Pruysen</HI> to the <HI>Oder</HI> and <HI>Warte,</HI> and now labours by the building of Sconces to free all the passage toward <HI>Silesia.</HI> For this inestimable fauour publike thanks∣giuing hath beene giuen to God in all Churches.</P>

<P>We are most troubled at this present of the Gouernour at <HI>Orsoy.

<HEAD>Contents of a Letter written from Paris the <HI>29.</HI> of Ianuary. <HI>1631.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I can communicate nothing vnto you concerning the pub∣like state at this present, but onely that those great diuersions and preparations which the great Turke makes in <HI>Transil∣uania,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in <HI>Germanie,</HI> administer great employment to his Emperiall Maiestie and yeeld him his hands full of businesse, more than well he can dispatch; inso∣much that the <HI>Spanish</HI> not being able to continue their war in Italie, without the ayd and assistance of the Emperour are con∣strained (as also doth the State) to hold themselues to the peace treated of and articled at <HI>Ratisborne,</HI> which by degrees proceeds in execution. <HI>Mazarine</HI> is here to hasten forward <HI>Monsieur Thorax,</HI> and <HI>De Seruient,</HI> Secretary of State; which two are the Commissaries which the King sends ouer the Alps or mountaines, in hostage or pledge in the behalfe of <HI>De Galuzzo,</HI> who hath full power in the behalfe of his Impe∣riall Maiestie for this execution. The said <HI>Galazzo</HI> hath al∣ready caused his moueables (or rather bootie) to be remoued from <HI>Mantua.</HI> And here is promise made that the Emperour shall shortly send that ratification which shall cause all these warres to cease.</P>
<P>Our diuisions at Court continue still; the Cardinall <HI>Riche∣lieu</HI> subsists yet powerfully, through the continuance and se∣quell of the Kings fauour toward him: how long the same shall endure I cannot so certainly assure you of it as I can and doe, to be your vnfained friend.</P>
