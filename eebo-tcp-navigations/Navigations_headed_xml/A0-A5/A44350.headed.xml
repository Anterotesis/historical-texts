<HEAD>To the Right Honourable

and one of their

Privy Council.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My most Honoured LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT hath been observed by several of
our late ingenious <HI>Writers,</HI> that an
eminent <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassador, af∣ter
a long residence in <HI>England,</HI> sayling
homeward, did cast his Eye back on this
Land, and said in his own language, O
<PB N="ii" REF="10"/>
<HI>Isola felicissima,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The happiest Coun∣trey
on the face of the Earth, did it not
want publick Spirits among them:</HI> Nor
do I think that the <HI>pudet haec opprobria
nobis,</HI> &amp;c. was in any Age so justly ap∣plicable
to <HI>England</HI> on this account as in
the present one, wherein Men generally
depraved by a <HI>selfish</HI> inhospitable tem∣per,
do like the <HI>Hedge hog,</HI> wrap them∣selves
up in their own warm <HI>Down,</HI> and
shew forth nothing but <HI>Bristles</HI> to the
rest of the World, and cry out <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>!
when they have found a Stone to throw
at an <HI>Inventor</HI> of any thing beneficial to
Mankind, instead of giving a tender
helping Hand to the <HI>Inventions</HI> them∣selves,
and which might with Iustiee be
expected, since few or none come into the
World with all the perfection they are
capable of.</P>
<P>But, <HI>My LORD,</HI> thô this <HI>Inventi∣on</HI>
of <HI>Mill'd-Lead</HI> (how much or little
soever I contributed to its first <HI>Concep∣tion,</HI>
it matters not, I being at its <HI>Birth</HI>
concerned in a greater share and Interest
therein, and the Transactions relating
thereto, than any one else, although <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
willingly then admitted the use of other
<PB N="iii" REF="10"/>
Names more considerable to give Counte∣nance
and Credit to the Work, and to
avoid Envy) hath been accompanyed
with tho fate of all Inventions, namely,
a <HI>peevish</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeavour of some <HI>narrow-soul'd</HI>
Men to <HI>run</HI> it down, yet accord∣ing
to the saying, <HI>Unus dum tibi pro∣pitius
est Jupiter, tu hosce mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utos
Deos, flocci feceris:</HI> Your Lordship
with your great Heroical <HI>Genius,</HI> and
your incomparable penetrating Vnder∣standing,
having surveyed all the circum∣stances
relating to this <HI>Invention,</HI> and
the past Transactions about it, and your
having afterward been pleased to patro∣nize
the Inventors and Invention, I can
easily be unconcerned at the Censures of
smaller People who are concerned against
it.</P>
<P><HI>My LORD,</HI> I have been long since
taught by a great <HI>Philosopher</HI> of the
Age, that <HI>When Reason is against
Men, they will be against Reason,</HI> and
have sufficiently observed, that the way
that most Men take to be cryed up for
<HI>Masters</HI> of Reason, is to make Reas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
<HI>serve</HI> them, that is, to serve their
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="11"/>I am not now to learn, that whoever
attempts the settlement of any Question,
which would be the unsettlement of any
mens <HI>Interest,</HI> may be suspected to have
either an unsettled Fortune, and that
like a New<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>comer to the Coast of such a
Question, he comes to settle himself there∣by,
or to have an unsettled Head, and
to be one who knows not that against
any thing by which Men get their living
they would not own to believe any that
came from the dead. Thô the Proofs for
any thing are as clear as the <HI>Meridian</HI>
light, yet where Men are <HI>Antipodes</HI> to
each other in Interest, at the same time
'tis <HI>Noon-day</HI> with the one, and <HI>Mid∣night</HI>
with the other.</P>
<P>And moreover, <HI>Reason</HI> as it resembles
Gold in being the most valued, so (as
one saith) it doth too, in being the most
<HI>ductile</HI> thing in Nature.</P>
<P>We know how much <HI>Mechanicks</HI> de∣pend
on the Rule of <HI>Rectum est index
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ui &amp; obliqui;</HI> and here it comes into
my mind to entertain your Lordship with
no unpleasant or vulgar Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culation in
Geometry, that <HI>Maximus Angulus est
recta linea, &amp; minimus Angulus est
<PB N="v" REF="11"/>
recta linea,</HI> the greatest Angle and the
least are both the same with a right
line.</P>
<P>But if it were for the general profit
or pleasure of Men to deny that there
is any right or strait line, or that any
Right Line can be made so much as for
use, many would be found to deny it
strenuously, and who perhaps either would
argue, that there is not in Nature any
right Line, and that all Lines are Ar∣tificially
made by the ducture of some
point, or the meeting of two superficies,
making the edge of any thing, or the
Contact of a <HI>Cylinder</HI> with a <HI>Plain,</HI>
and that neither of these wayes can pro∣duce
a right Line, because there is no
true strait <HI>Superficies,</HI> but what has in∣equality
or hollowness in it, and that
consequently the motion of any Point up∣on
any uneven <HI>Superficies,</HI> or the mu∣tual
concurrence of two uneven <HI>Super∣ficies</HI>
can never produce an even or right
Line, or who else would, if not cut off,
yet jogg the Hands of those they found
making right Lines, or if they found
any made, would either oblitterate them,
or apply <HI>Microscopes</HI> to them, whereby
<PB N="vi" REF="12"/>
some inequality or raggedness in them
would be discovered, or they would per∣vert
Witnesses to swear, or Iudges to
decree, that they were not Right Lines,
or perhaps they would turn the making
of Right Lines into <HI>Ridicule,</HI> according
to the Humour of this Age, or accord∣ing
to the humour of an old <HI>barbarous</HI>
former one, maliciously call it the <HI>Black
Art.</HI></P>
<P>We know that according to the <HI>Sea-phrase</HI>
one <HI>Ship</HI> is said to <HI>wrong</HI> ano∣ther,
that excels it in swiftness of sail∣ing:
And thus the <HI>Shipwrights</HI> and
<HI>Plumbers</HI> may if they please think the
Mill'd-Lead Invention hath <HI>wrong'd</HI>
them in doing so much right to Shipping
and Navigation in particular.</P>
<P>Nor is it indeed possible for any New
<HI>Invention,</HI> how profitable soever to Man∣kind,
to appear in the World, but that
such new <HI>Illumination</HI> must <HI>stand</HI> in some
Mens <HI>light,</HI> and obstruct their <HI>pratique</HI>
in those Arts of life wherein they were
expert. Thus there is no doubt but the
<HI>Invention</HI> of the <HI>Sea-Compass</HI> was ma∣ligned
by the old dull <HI>Coasters,</HI> and that
of <HI>Printing</HI> by the <HI>Hackney</HI> Writers,
<PB N="vii" REF="12"/>
and the excellent Notion of the <HI>circula∣tion</HI>
of the Blood, by the old <HI>Mump<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣mus</HI>
Doctors, who being sufficiently at
ease by the Circulation of <HI>Money</HI> and
<HI>Trade</HI> in the Realm▪ knew how to stuff
their hollow Teeth with their Patient's
Bread, without studying <HI>Anatomy;</HI> the
knowledge whereof hath been enriched by
a full <HI>third</HI> part at least within this last
<HI>Century,</HI> as the learned Dr. <HI>Henshaw</HI>
tells us, in his very ingenious Book call∣ed
<HI>A Register for the Air,</HI> printed <HI>An.
1677.</HI> and wherein he hath published an
excellent Invention of a <HI>Domicil</HI> or <HI>Air
Chamber▪</HI> and by means whereof in any
part of our Native Soyl we may
have the Air as pure as on the top of the
<HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Teneriffe,</HI> and made so pure as
is not to be found on the face of the ha∣bitable
Earth.</P>
<P>And thus no doubt but the Gold-smiths
and Silver-smiths would think
themselves injured by any who could
revive the Art of making Glass <HI>malle∣able,</HI>
which one in <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s time had
found out a way to do, and withall
so yielding, and such as would rather
bow than break; for he bringing a Glass
<PB N="viii" REF="13"/>
Vial to the Emperour to shew his Art,
he threw the Vessel against the Stone-pavement,
with which blow it was not
broken but dented, and then taking his
Hammer, be again beat out the dent:
But he was secretly made away for his
pains, as likewise several Inventors have
been by the <HI>Dullards</HI> who only had the
Wit to do that, and the Assassinates
have thought they might dispatch them
as justly as Souldiers think they may deal
so with those who come to beat up their
Quarters.</P>
<P>Yet however the fate of some Inven∣tors
hath been to <HI>fall</HI> at the feet of En∣vious
<HI>Plebeian</HI> Mechanicks, others of
them have had that reward of their <HI>dili∣gence</HI>
in all Ages and Countreys, <HI>to
stand before Kings;</HI> and the Vicege∣rents
of the God of Nature have with
peculiar respect treated such as <HI>the King
of Kings delighted to honour,</HI> by im∣parting
the secrets of Nature to them.</P>
<P>And such respect hath been shewn to
the Memory of useful <HI>Inventors</HI> by the
greatest Princes, that several <HI>Histori∣ans</HI>
have mentioned it, that <HI>Charles</HI> the
<HI>5th.</HI> with a great <HI>Parade</HI> of his Atten∣dants,
<PB N="ix" REF="13"/>
went out of his way to see the
<HI>Tomb</HI> of <HI>William Buckeld,</HI> who (as
it was recorded in his <HI>Epitaph</HI>) was
the <HI>Inventor</HI> of the <HI>Dutch</HI> way of <HI>Pick∣ling</HI>
of <HI>Herrings,</HI> which is so beneficial
to those <HI>States,</HI> that may make it be said
that <HI>Amsterdam</HI> is founded upon <HI>Her∣ring</HI>
bones: His Countrey-men it seems
were so just to him, as to perpetuate
the fame of the <HI>Invention</HI> as well as
the Name of the <HI>Inventor</HI> by a grate∣ful
Inscription.</P>
<P>And thus too was the Memory of
<HI>Ludovicus a Culen,</HI> Professor of <HI>Geo∣metry</HI>
at <HI>Leyden,</HI> honoured by those
<HI>States,</HI> by their taking care that on his
Tomb should be engraven <HI>his Attempt to
find out the proportion between a Dia∣meter
and a Circle, dividing the Cir∣cle
into more parts than Sand would
constitute the whole Earth, and yet an
Uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was too much, and a Null too
little.</HI></P>
<P>I am here minded of mentioning how
the Tomb of <HI>Peter Pet,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Ma∣ster-builder
of <HI>England</HI> (and whose An∣cestors
for upwards of two hundred
Years have been Master-builders and
<PB N="x" REF="14"/>
principal Officers of the <HI>Navy</HI> Royal) re∣cords
his being the <HI>first Inventor</HI> of our
<HI>English</HI> Frigats, and of which the <HI>Con∣stant
Warwick,</HI> built by him in the Year
1646. was the <HI>first,</HI> and which sort of
<HI>Shipping</HI> is variously the most excellent
and useful in the known World.</P>
<P>And it having been the fortune of
all the <HI>Master builders</HI> of that Family
gradually to excel each other in their
Art, I cannot here omit to take notice
how Sir <HI>Phineas Pett,</HI> the Son of that
great Artist, having built fifteen <HI>Capi∣tal</HI>
Ships for the <HI>Royal</HI> Navy, besides
many more of the lesser <HI>Rate,</HI> hath obli∣ged
his Countrey with a great deal of ad∣mirable
<HI>Invention</HI> in the Fabrick of the
<HI>Kings fisher,</HI> a <HI>fourth</HI> Rate, built by
him in the <HI>Year</HI> 1675.</P>
<P>For whereas all Ships before, since
the first use of Navigation, were built
by <HI>rising</HI> Lines, which made not so re∣gular
a Figure in the Water, he built
that by <HI>Horizontal</HI> ones, and so contri∣ved
the <HI>Port holes</HI> therein, that most of
her <HI>Guns</HI> might point to one <HI>Center,</HI> and
thereby cause such breaches in the sides
of the Ship she fought with, that could
<PB N="xi" REF="14"/>
not be stopp'd with <HI>Pluggs,</HI> and that
brought her safe off from her being taken
by seven <HI>Algerine</HI> Men of War, accord∣ing
to the <HI>Relation</HI> of it in the <HI>Gazets</HI>
I have been informed of, and which
could not have happened but by her
<HI>Guns</HI> so <HI>pointing,</HI> making such great
breaches in their sides as forced them to
draw off. And so much hath the New
<HI>Invention</HI> of the building her by such
Lines, contributed to the excellency of
her sayling, that I have read it in a <HI>re∣lation</HI>
of the <HI>Engagement</HI> between <HI>her</HI>
and the <HI>Golden Rose</HI> of <HI>Algiers,</HI> so
much <HI>famed</HI> for her <HI>sailing,</HI> printed in
<HI>London</HI> in the Year 1681. that the
<HI>Kings-fisher</HI> much <HI>out sail'd</HI> that Ship,
and having taken her, found so much
Water in her <HI>Hold,</HI> occasioned by the
great breaches in her sides, which made
her to sink down within an hour after
her Capture.</P>
<P>What the great <HI>effects</HI> of such an <HI>In∣vention</HI>
may hereafter be throughout the
Maritime World, I know not, <HI>Capital</HI>
Ships being now liable to be <HI>sunk</HI> by <HI>Bul∣lets</HI>
which before they were not, by rea∣son
of the multitude of <HI>Pluggs</HI> and <HI>Hands</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="15"/>
to apply them, always in readiness, unless
a Shot had lighted in the Powder-room,
as was supposed to have happened in Ad∣miral
<HI>Opdam</HI>'s Ship. But he having
done so much impartial Iustice to the
<HI>Invention</HI> of the <HI>Mill'd-Lead-Sheath∣ing,</HI>
I am very well contented that it
comes in my way here to retaliate to him
by the just mention of the matters of fact
whereby he hath obliged this Age and suc∣ceeding
ones, to account him a Benefactor
to his Countrey.</P>
<P>And, <HI>my Lord,</HI> I do think my self
the more obliged out of my love to my
Native Countrey, to present your Lord∣ship
with this glancing View of these
two great <HI>Inventions,</HI> because they are
very likely in a short time to come a∣mong
<HI>Panciroll</HI>'s <HI>Res deperditae,</HI> with∣out
care taken to prevent it; for King
<HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>second,</HI> who had very great
Skill in the Mystery of the <HI>Shipwrights</HI>
Calling, hath been heard to observe it,
<HI>that the Fabricks of our</HI> English <HI>Ships
did for several Years more and more
degenerate from the Friga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way in
wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch the</HI> Constant Warwick <HI>was built,
to the way of our sluggish old built
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
Ships, and not at all adapted for swift∣ness
of Sailing, and insomuch that the</HI>
Constant Warwick <HI>it self being after the
Death of the Inventor repaired by a∣nother
Artist, was in its repairing spoil∣ed
of the excellency of its sailing.</HI></P>
<P>Nor have I heard of any other Ship
built by the <HI>Kings-fisher</HI>'s Lines, ex∣cept
the <HI>Katherine Yatcht.</HI> And there∣fore
it is of great importance to the Na∣tion
that the Draughts of those three
Vessels particularly should be transmitted
with great Care to Posterity.</P>
<P>I must not here forget to mention, that
among the many <HI>Capital</HI> Ships built by
Sir <HI>Phinehas Pett,</HI> the <HI>BRITANNIA</HI> is
by the <HI>concordant</HI> Voice of all the curious

<P>I have the rather thought fit to
mention the just celebration of this
Ship, because some impudent Scrib∣lers
of the <HI>Coffee-House</HI> News-Let∣ters
presumed last Summer to scan∣dalize
her, as if she were <HI>rotten,</HI> and
<PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>
<HI>disabled</HI> for Sea-service, whereas in
truth she was then only put into the <HI>Dock</HI>

were built pursuant to the Order of

be lanched out perfectly good, and as
strong as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver.</P>
<P>It was a <HI>proverbial</HI> saying among the

they would have been Pillory'd, or

<P>Our excellent Statesman Sir <HI>William

of a <HI>publick spirited</HI> Man, for the ex∣cellent
Writings he hath published) in
his <HI>Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vey of the Constitutions and In-Interests
of the Empire and other Coun∣tries,
with their relation to his Maje∣sty
<PB N="xvii" REF="17"/>
in the Year</HI> 1671. mentions <HI>the
strength of our Shipping, as having for
many Ages past (and still for ought we
know) made us an over-match for the
strongest of our Neighbours at Sea;</HI>
and speaks of <HI>the</HI> Dutch <HI>having been
awed by the strength of our Oak, and
the Art of our Shipwrights,</HI> &amp;c. It is
therefore not without reason, that the
<HI>Charter</HI> of the Corporation of our <HI>Ship∣wrights</HI>
hath obliged them not to com∣municate
their <HI>Art</HI> to any Forreign <HI>Prince</HI>
or <HI>State.</HI> But yet when I consider that
whereas the Contracts of the Navy-Board
for building of Ships did 'till
within these few Years past oblige the
Builders to build with good substantial
<HI>English</HI> Oaken Timber and Plank, and
that such not being now to be had, that
word [<HI>English</HI>] is left out, and liber∣ty
given to build with forreign; and fur∣ther
consider, that application was made
to the <HI>Ministers</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>se∣cond</HI>
by the <HI>Cnrporation</HI> of <HI>Shipwrights,</HI>
shortly after his <HI>Restoration,</HI> with their

Trees might be <HI>planted</HI> in his Ma∣jesty's

<HI>self-evidence</HI> of the <HI>practicableness</HI> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thing with ease, and that had not so <HI>great</HI>
a <HI>Proposition</HI> then evaporated, but on the
contrary have been vigorously pursued, the
<HI>Oaken</HI> Timber sufficient for the use of the
<HI>Navy</HI> Royal had now been in a forward way
to its sufficient growth: For it having been
known that <HI>Acorns</HI> sown, have in the space
of <HI>thirty</HI> Years born a <HI>Stemme</HI> of a Foot
<HI>diameter,</HI> 'tis obvious how soon they will
bear a <HI>stemme</HI> of a foot and a half <HI>diame∣ter,</HI>
and that such <HI>Timber</HI> so of a <HI>foot</HI> and
a <HI>half,</HI> will be sufficiently serviceable in the
building of Ships. I say, when I consider
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
these things, and fear how few else consider
them here, and how many observe and con∣sider
them abroad, I think there is too
much occasion to bewail our Soils not being
fertile with men of publick Spirits.</P>
<P>Whether we shall at this rate come to
build with <HI>English</HI> Oak again before
<HI>Plato</HI>'s great <HI>Year,</HI> I know not: But,
<HI>my Lord,</HI> this that I have said doth
speak, (or as I may say) cry it aloud to
us, that while we have the <HI>Mill'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Lead
Sheathing</HI> for Ships, without fear of
losing it, that he will scarce deserve to
be thought a <HI>Patriot,</HI> who at this time of
day, when the Crown hath so little Timber
in its <HI>Forrests</HI> serviceable for Shipping,
and hath Lead of our own for Sheathing,
would have it unnecessarily send a great
deal of Money for <HI>Eastland</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irr for that
purpose, of which the arrival here will be
so uncertain, and indeed hazardous in
time of War.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I intend not to entertain
your Lordship with Rhetorical flourishes
and <HI>Harangues</HI> of the usefulness of the
<HI>Invention</HI> of the <HI>Mill'd-Lead Sheathing:</HI>
It is of <HI>Age</HI> in the World to <HI>speak</HI> for it
self, and it hath had the Honour not on∣ly
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
to have great <HI>unbyass'd</HI> Artists for
its <HI>Encomiasts,</HI> but a great <HI>Prince,</HI> who
had a <HI>profound</HI> Iudgment in the <HI>Ship∣wrights</HI>
Mystery, I mean King <HI>Charles
the second:</HI> For as soon as Sir <HI>Francis
Watson</HI> had acquainted him with the
<HI>Invention</HI> of Milling Lead for <HI>Sheath∣ing,</HI>
his Majesty was very impatient 'till
he had made experiment thereof, where∣upon
Lead was prepared by a small En∣gine,
wherewith the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> a <HI>fourth</HI>
Rate was sheathed by Sir <HI>Anthony Dean</HI>
at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> which he saw done with
care, the <HI>Bolt-heads,</HI> &amp;c. being fairly
parcelled, as they ought to be in any
sheathing; and after divers <HI>Voyages</HI> to
the <HI>Straits, Guinea,</HI> and the <HI>West In∣dies,</HI>
she had her sheathing strip'd at se∣ven
Years end to repair the <HI>Plank,</HI> but
not for any defect in the <HI>Sheathing</HI>
it self. Nor could those of the <HI>Navy-Board,</HI>
when at their attendance on the
<HI>Council</HI> with their Complaints of <HI>Eight</HI>
Ships in <HI>Twenty,</HI> make the least <HI>Obje∣ction</HI>
(though they were fairly challeng∣ed
to it) against the <HI>Rudder-Irons, Bolts,</HI>
or other <HI>Iron work</HI> of the <HI>Phoenix;</HI> the
which made that judicious Peer, the then
<PB N="xxi" REF="19"/>
<HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Hallifax</HI> declare, That if of
<HI>twenty</HI> Ships they complained of <HI>Nine∣teen,</HI>
and had nothing to say against the
<HI>twentieth,</HI> he must conclude it to be the
Workmens fault, for if they had done the
other <HI>nineteen</HI> as that <HI>twentieth</HI> Ship
was done, they must have proved all as
well as she: The <HI>King</HI> also at the same
time, when they objecting that the <HI>Mer∣chants</HI>
did not use it, which they would
do if it was so good a sheathing as was
pretended, replyed, <HI>That the Shipwrights
(whose best Friend the Worm was)
wanted not Skill to discourage them;
yet that their decrying it must soon be
discerned to proceed from their inte∣rest.</HI>
And indeed it is obvious how the
<HI>Shipwrights</HI> do influence the <HI>Merchants</HI>
and <HI>Owners</HI> in the <HI>Sheathing</HI> and other
<HI>Repairs</HI> of Ships, by their being general∣ly
<HI>Part-Owners</HI> in all the new Ships they
build.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be wondred at that the <HI>King</HI>
from the beginning gave all the encou∣ragement
he could to this <HI>Invention;</HI> for
when he considered of the thing upon Sir
<HI>Francis Wat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI>'s first laying it before him,
his Majesty pressed him to make effectual
<PB N="xxii" REF="20"/>
Preparation for the Work, saying, <HI>It
would save him at least</HI> 40000 l. <HI>a
Year in his Navy,</HI> the which was not
improbable, if it had met with that due
encouragement, use and application for
<HI>Sheathing, Scuppers, Bread rooms,</HI> and
all other purposes it was capable of, with
regard had to the charge and damage
that a Wood-sheathing brings to the Plank
by the great <HI>Nail-holes,</HI> which they use
to <HI>spile</HI> up at <HI>stripping,</HI> and other in∣conveniences
that attend Wood-sheath∣ing.</P>
<P>And here it occurrs to my thoughts,
that his <HI>Majesty</HI> being occasionally in
<HI>Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford yard,</HI> as the <HI>Workmen</HI> were
bringing on an ordinary <HI>Straits</HI>-sheathing
with Wood upon one of his small Ships, he
asked them <HI>why they did not sheath her
with Mill'd-Lead,</HI> and answer was made,
<HI>she was a weak Ship, and required
strengthning.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> thereupon replyed,
<HI>they had as good have sheathed her with
Sar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enet, as such a sheathing to streng∣then
her,</HI> and saying, <HI>Lord have Mer∣cy
on the Men who depend on that
sheathing, if the Ship be not strong
enough her self without it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="20"/>One would think now, <HI>my Lord,</HI> that
after so <HI>great</HI> a <HI>King,</HI> so judicious in all
Naval <HI>Mechanicks</HI> had approved the
great usefulness of this <HI>Invention,</HI> and af∣ter
all his eminent <HI>Master-builders</HI> (and
who were the only Shiprights <HI>disinterest∣ed</HI>
from opposing it, in regard their sub∣sistence
depended only on their Salaries
from the Crown) had done so too, it
should be some potent and weighty Obje∣ction
that should be a <HI>Remora</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s <HI>pro∣gress.</HI>
But according to the idle con∣ceit
of the Fish <HI>Remora,</HI> which mens
so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tishness hath made a <HI>vulgar</HI> one, name∣ly
that it can stop the <HI>motion</HI> of a Ship
under <HI>sail,</HI> (and some vain <HI>Authors</HI> have
essayed in print to give reasons for such
energy of that Fish; and other <HI>Authors</HI>
have attributed the cause of that Fish's
power to that mighty nothing of <HI>occult
qualities,</HI> whereas the true cause of that
<HI>vulgar</HI> Error was what an old famous
<HI>Naturalist</HI> said of that<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fish, <HI>Flent ven∣ti,
saeviant procellae, semper Navem
immobiliter tenet;</HI> which implies no
more, but that notwithstanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny vio∣lent
<HI>Tempests,</HI> it always did stick to
the Ship immoveably) a <HI>superstitious</HI>
<PB N="xxiv" REF="21"/>
vain <HI>imagination</HI> of an <HI>impossibility,</HI>
namely, of the <HI>Mill'd Lead</HI> corroding
the <HI>Iron-work,</HI> through some <HI>occult
quality,</HI> hath been made use of as the
<HI>Remora</HI> that hath hindred the progress
of this <HI>Invention,</HI> when it was so fair∣ly
under sail, and had made so good a
<HI>Voyage</HI> for the <HI>Crown,</HI> as to bring it
above <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> profit, besides
the great advantage in sailing.</P>
<P>But it is no matter of <HI>Raillery,</HI> to
observe that many excellent and most
useful <HI>Inventions</HI> have been <HI>run down</HI> in
the World by <HI>superstitious</HI> Fancies and
Imaginations, and fortifying impossibi∣lities
with <HI>occult</HI> qualities; insomuch
that our late <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>burying</HI> in <HI>Flan∣nel,</HI>
that was of such benefit to the pub∣lick,
was once in danger of being run
down by an idle Notion of an impossibi∣lity
that intoxicated the beliefs of the
<HI>Mob,</HI> namely, that the Air was likely
to receive putrefaction by Flannels ma∣king
the Dead to sweat; and as reaso∣nably
may the <HI>populace</HI> here imagine,
that the <HI>New-River-Water</HI> conveyed to
dress their <HI>Meat</HI> through <HI>Pipes</HI> of <HI>Lead,</HI>
will corrode their entrails, if Lead hath
<PB N="xxv" REF="21"/>
such an <HI>occult</HI> quality to <HI>corrode</HI> Iron:
And as well may we be afraid to take
the <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle, because of its be∣ing
long kept in boxes of <HI>Lead.</HI></P>
<P>But your <HI>Lordships</HI> Iudgment is so
excellent, that it cannot be imposed on
by a <HI>Non Causa pro Causa,</HI> or any
other <HI>fallacy;</HI> and that I might total∣ly
avoid the least suspicion of one who
would impose either on your <HI>Lordship,</HI>
or on any of Mankind, while under the
shelter of your Lordships Name I write
to the World, I have here fairly and
candidly set forth the Matters of Fact
in the Transactions the Settlement of this
Invention hath occasioned on the Stage
of the World.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I know it is fit for your
Lordships entire satisfaction, and that
of others, that I should mention what
ensued upon the Company's <HI>Reply</HI> to
the <HI>Navy-Board</HI> before the Lords <HI>Com∣missioners</HI>
of the <HI>Admiralty.</HI> In short,
one of those Lords, who was likewise a
Member of the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> was by
that Admiralty-Board desired to carry
both that Report and Reply to the Coun∣cil-Board:
And upon reading the <HI>Re∣port,</HI>
<PB N="xxvi" REF="22"/>
his Majesty in Council was pleas'd
to referr the whole matter back again
to those Commissioners of the <HI>Admiral∣ty;</HI>
and whereupon the <HI>Company</HI> ad∣dressed
themselves by the <HI>Memorial</HI> here∣with
also published, desiring that for the
greater clearness of the matters com∣plained
of, that what the Navy-Board
or the Company had further to say, might
be laid down before them in Writing. It
is fit I should here acquaint your Lord∣ship
that the Companys Reply was drawn
by the excellent Pen of Mr. <HI>Pepys,</HI> and
whom the <HI>Author</HI> of that most elaborate
Book, <HI>The happy future State of</HI> Eng∣land,
doth deservedly call <HI>the great
Treasurer of Naval and Maritime know∣ledge,
and of the great variety of the
Learning which we call</HI> Recondita Eru∣ditio.
And it is no reflection on the In∣tegrity
of those Gentlemen of the Navy-Board,
who made the complaining <HI>Re∣port</HI>
against this <HI>Invention,</HI> when I shall
say that Mr. <HI>Pepys</HI> his <HI>Character</HI> justly
renders him <HI>aequiponderous</HI> to them in
Moral, and much superiour in Philoso∣phical
and Political Knowledge, and the
universal Knowledge of the <HI>Oeconomy</HI>
of the Navy.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvii" REF="22"/>
But before there was any further pro∣ceeding,
his Majesty thought fit to <HI>su∣persede</HI>
that Commission for executing
the <HI>Office</HI> of the <HI>Lord High Admiral:</HI>
And the King then taking the <HI>Admiral∣ty</HI>
into his own hands, and the <HI>Compa∣ny</HI>
having thoughts to Petition his Ma∣jesty
to hear the whole Matter himself,
they were by some Persons newly put into
the Navy-Board, (who had for several
Years shewed their approbation of the
<HI>Mill'd-Lead Sheathing</HI>) advised to offer
to that Board a New Proposal to sheath
at a rate certain by the yard <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re,</HI>
and with an intimation that the Navy-Board
would take it more kindly, and
that they were by this time satisfied that
their former Complaint was by misinfor∣mation.
This Advice was approved, and
a new Proposal laid before the Board,
the <HI>20th.</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1686. which
was much approved by Mr. <HI>Pepys,</HI> say∣ing,
<HI>That he doubted not but they
would comply with it; and declaring
that on his part when it came into his
way, he would promote it, as he had
a full Conviction</HI> (to use his own words)
<HI>that it was a great Service to the King;</HI>
<PB N="xxviii" REF="23"/>
and whether for that there was no occa∣sion
for a good while to sheath any of the
Kings Ships, or by reason of a great deal
of peremptory business calling for the time
of that Board, or by the Company's hap∣pening
to be slack in their application, I
know not; but it seems that after a years
time that Board was pleased to referr to
two of their own Members, Sir <HI>Phine∣has
Pett</HI> and Sir <HI>Anthony Dean</HI> (who
had both of them been <HI>Master-builders</HI>)
the Consideration of the Company's new
<HI>Proposal.</HI> Nor could the Company wish
for more equal Iudges of the <HI>Mill'd-Lead
Sheathing,</HI> than those two worthy
Persons, who so well understood it, and
had formerly done so much right to it up∣on
all occasions, as judging it so much for
the King's service: But the Kings ser∣vice
calling them from the Navy-Board
to a long stay at <HI>Chatham,</HI> to which
place it stood not with the Company's con∣venience
to repair, and there press them
to make their Report; and a long Sick∣ness
seizing on Sir <HI>Phinehas Pett</HI> at his
return from <HI>Chatham,</HI> and he being
shortly after his recovery, employed in a
Iourney about the King's service in some
<PB N="xxix" REF="23"/>
other of his Majesty's remote Yards; or
what else being the true Cause thereof,
as your Lordship may judge, so it is that
the said Proposal, which is herewith also
printed lies still before that Board with∣out
any further proceedings thereon ever
since.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I have now let your Lord∣ship
see how I have been <HI>damnatus ad Me∣tallum</HI>
in the progress of this Invention:
And considering the course of corrupt and
degenerate humane Nature, no <HI>Inventers</HI>
can promise themselves a nobler fate, thô
the scene of their Invention lay in a no∣bler
mettal.</P>
<P><HI>For as Sir</HI> William Petty <HI>well ob∣serves
in his</HI> Observations <HI>on the</HI> Bills <HI>of</HI>
Mortality, <HI>that</HI> if the art of making gold
were known to one person, such single
<HI>adeptus</HI> could not, nay durst not enjoy
it, but must be either a Prisoner to some
Prince, and slave to some voluptuary,
or else sculk obscurely up and down
for his privacy and concealment.</P>
<P>And so churlish hath the generality of
Men been to Inventers, whose discove∣ries
have only <HI>salved</HI> the <HI>Phoenomena,</HI>
that they have been unwilling to give
<PB N="xxx" REF="24"/>
those a good word who have taught the
Age great things, yet such where the
brightness of their knowledge would not
have the operation of the Sun-beams, in
putting out any mans Kitchin fire.</P>
<P>And this made the Great <HI>Tycho
Brahe,</HI> as to his famed <HI>Discovery</HI> con∣sole
himself, by appealing from the <HI>judg∣ment</HI>
of the Age he lived in to that of
<HI>Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>I shall here divert your Lordship, by
entertaining you in his <HI>Study</HI> which he
had in an Island in <HI>Denmark</HI> by the
Munificence of his Patron King <HI>Frede∣rick,</HI>
and where (removing the cover of
the room) he could as he lay with his
face upward in the Night time exercise
his speculation with beholding the Stars.
And there he had all the famous <HI>Astro∣nomers</HI>
painted, and the following Ver∣ses
were added, each to the <HI>Picture</HI> to
which they belonged.</P>

<P><PB N="xxxii" REF="25"/>Your Lordship who knows so many things,
can be no stranger to the fate of <HI>Galilaeus,</HI>
who after he had placed the <HI>Earth</HI> among
the <HI>Heavens,</HI> found so much ingratitude
on it as to be made a <HI>Prisoner</HI> in it for so
doing, by no meaner a Man than Pope
<HI>Urban</HI> the <HI>8th. Gassendus</HI> tells us of this
in his <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Peiresk,</HI> and how <HI>Peiresk</HI>
wrote a Letter to him, to condole with
him during his confinement, and employ'd
his interest in a great <HI>Cardinal</HI> to pro∣cure
his enlargement. Pope <HI>Urban,</HI> it
seems, had wrote an idle Comment upon
<HI>Aristotle de Coelo,</HI> and <HI>Galilaeus</HI> thought

<P>Thus dangerous a thing is it for a Man

<P>And here it comes in my way to ob∣serve
how Dr. <HI>Robert Wood,</HI> a person
very famous for all Mathematical know∣ledge,
lately trying to <HI>salve</HI> the Credit
of this <HI>Age</HI> from being thought <HI>barba∣rous</HI>
on the account of <HI>Easter-day</HI> being
so ill fixt in our <HI>Liturgy,</HI> hath not been
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="25"/>
by any <HI>Author</HI> I have met with, except
one, so much as quoted for his illumina∣ting
us.</P>
<P><HI>The only Person who quotes him for it,
is, the Author of</HI> The happy future State
of <HI>England, and he there in</HI> p. 241. <HI>like
a careful observer of the Age, hath these
following passages,</HI> viz. The great Con∣troversie
about <HI>Easter,</HI> that heretofore
put all the World in a rattle, and al∣most
shook it to pieces, what a toy is
it self now reputed, insomuch that our
latest Ascertainers here of the time of
its celebration, seem'd not to think it
<HI>tanti</HI> to awake when they were about
it; and thô onr lately having in our
Almanacks two <HI>Easters</HI> in one Year, ea∣sily
awaken'd the Non-conformists to
take notice of it, and to say, that
therefore they could not give their un∣feigned
assent and consent to all and
every thing contained in, and prescri∣bed
by the Book entituled <HI>The Book of
Common-Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. And thô thereup∣on
a Person of the Royal Society, very
profoundly knowing in all the Mathe∣matical
Sciences, hath publish'd an in∣fallible
way of fixing <HI>Easter</HI> for ever,
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="26"/>
(and that it may be no longer a fugi∣tive
from the rule of its practice, as it
often is at present, nor dance away
from it self, as I may say in allusion to
the <HI>vulgar Error</HI> of the Suns dancing
on <HI>Easter-day</HI>) and fixing it so as per∣haps
none else could have done, nor
possibly himself any other way, yet
hath this great right done to that great
day, been by the generality of People
not so much regarded as would <HI>an Ad∣vice

have been.</P>
<P>But however, the <HI>Doctor</HI> having pub∣lish'd
it but in a <HI>quarter</HI> of a <HI>Sheet</HI> of

<P><HI>The</HI> Author <HI>in that Book mentions his
having chosen in the conjuncture in which
he writ,</HI> to build his Fabricks of Num∣bers
and Calculations on the course soil
of Popery and the Papal Usurpations,
and that finding that Mens Fancies at
that time relished no subject grateful
but Popery, he made that the Vehicle
of the Notions he meant as Phyfic to
cure their Understandings: <HI>And he there</HI>
hits <HI>a</HI> blot <HI>in the Papal</HI> Teners <HI>that was
<PB N="xxxix" REF="28"/>
never</HI> hit <HI>before by any Protestant Writer,
namely the rendring it to be one of those
Ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,</HI> That it is lawful to burn a
whole City, <HI>in which the major part are</HI>
Hereticks, <HI>expecting such a</HI> Discovery
<HI>should be very welcome to the</HI> populace <HI>in
that</HI> Conjuncture.</P>
<P>His so much and so often celebrating
the <HI>Royal Society</HI> throughout his <HI>Work,</HI>
was too a stemming of the tide of <HI>humour</HI>
that prevailed with a great part of the
Age, who knowing little either of the Old
or New Philosophy, or real Learning and
<HI>Experimental Philosophy,</HI> value them∣selves
on the <HI>ridiculing</HI> and <HI>crying down</HI>
those who advance the same.</P>
<P>And having thus again referred to this
book of the <HI>Happy future State of</HI> England,
and to which I do but common Iustice in
representing it full of most useful Inventions
and new <HI>Discoveries</HI> in Politicks, must too
refer to the common fate of Discoverers it
hath met with, namely, in finding the
World an unteachable <HI>Animal.</HI> I do not
account the Author's great <HI>Notion</HI> in <HI>p.</HI>
112. new, namely, <HI>That the knowledge
of the Numbers of the People is the</HI> sub∣stratum
<HI>of all Political Measures:</HI> For
<PB N="xl" REF="29"/>
that <HI>Thesis</HI> those words of the <HI>Captain
of our Salvation</HI> have long since taught
the World, namely, <HI>What King going to
make War against another King, sit∣eth
not down first and consulteth whe∣ther
he be able with ten thousand to
meet him that cometh against him with
twenty thousand? or else while the
other is yet a great way of, he sendeth
an Embassage, and desireth Conditions
of Peace?</HI></P>
<P>But after so great a <HI>Minister</HI> of State
as <HI>Myn Heer Van Beuninghen</HI> had (as
<HI>De Leti</HI> hath mention'd it in print) made
the People of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> to be
but <HI>two Millions:</HI> And after so illustri∣ous
a <HI>Writer</HI> as Dr. <HI>Isaac Vossius</HI> in his
<HI>Variarum Observationum liber,</HI> dedi∣cated
to King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> had made
the People in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> to be but <HI>two Millions,</HI> (thô
both of them probably had read the <HI>Ob∣servations</HI>
on the <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Mortality</HI> where∣in
excellent fine-spun <HI>Notions</HI> had made the
<HI>People</HI> about six <HI>Millions</HI>) his so largely
instructing us out of <HI>Records,</HI> (and a∣gainst
which there is no averment) and
particularly out of the <HI>Returns</HI> of all the
<PB N="xli" REF="29"/>
<HI>Counties</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> upon
several late <HI>Pole Acts;</HI> and out of the
<HI>Numbers</HI> of the <HI>Conformists</HI> and <HI>Non∣conformists</HI>
upon the <HI>Bishops Survey</HI>
made in the <HI>Year</HI> 1676. that the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI>
of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> are above
<HI>eight Millions</HI> (and indeed that we may
probably conclude them to be about <HI>ten
Millions</HI>) may be said to be an happy New
<HI>Discovery</HI> for us in <HI>Politicks,</HI> he being
the <HI>first</HI> who evinced it out of <HI>Records,</HI>
and wherein his <HI>Benefactorship</HI> to his
Countrey in the doing it at his own charge,
might in the paying of <HI>Fees</HI> to <HI>Clerks</HI>
and <HI>Registers</HI> well be thought to surpass
the charge of the impression of that volu∣minous
Work; without reckoning in the
great charge he must have been at in
having accounts of various importations
taken by Officers of the Custome-house out
of their Books, as particularly in <HI>p.</HI> 254.</P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> gives well-grounded <HI>Ac∣counts</HI>
of the Numbers of the People in
<HI>France, Spain, Flanders</HI> and <HI>Holland:</HI>
But if he had took the pains to calculate
the <HI>Numbers</HI> of the People in <HI>China,
Aethiopia,</HI> or <HI>Tartaria,</HI> it had been as
acceptable to many of our <HI>continuando-talkers</HI>
<PB N="xlii" REF="30"/>
of <HI>Politicks,</HI> and to some who
would take it ill not to be <HI>vogued</HI> for
first-rate <HI>Politicians,</HI> though they never
spent a thought about reducing <HI>Politicks

<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I have herewith for your
<PB N="xlvii" REF="32"/>
Lordships farther Entertainment thought
fit to <HI>publish</HI> Sir <HI>William Petty</HI>'s rough
draught of <HI>Naval Philosophy.</HI> The
<HI>filings</HI> of <HI>Gold</HI> are precious, and a <HI>Schytz</HI>
or hasty Piece of Painting done by a great
<HI>Hand</HI> is of great Value. To have drawn
so great an historical Picture of that
<HI>Philosophy,</HI> as he had the <HI>Idea</HI> of in
his Mind, would have took up his whole
Life: And he therefore considering the
little value the <HI>Age</HI> hath for such Curio∣sities,
thought it only worth his while to
finish this Piece up at one sitting, and to
shew Posterity what he could have done.
But in this as it is, the <HI>Judicious</HI> few
will find many a <HI>Coup de Maitre,</HI> and
may instruct themselves thereby in some
very considerable principles relating to
<HI>Naval</HI> and <HI>Maritine</HI> knowledge.</P>
<P>My Lord, I know that <HI>Providence</HI>
hath so disposed of the course of your
<HI>Lordships</HI> Life, as to call you to <HI>do</HI> things
that are to be <HI>written of,</HI> rather than to
read things by others already <HI>written.</HI>
Your <HI>Lordships</HI> great and successful
<HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Conduct,</HI> lately so <HI>conspi∣cuous</HI>
to the <HI>World</HI> in the taking of <HI>Cork</HI>

the <HI>Annals</HI> of our <HI>Nation,</HI> and adde a
further <HI>lustre</HI> to the Name of <HI>Marlbo∣rough,</HI>
which was so much <HI>ennobled</HI> by
your Lordships <HI>Predecessor,</HI> that the great
<HI>Poets</HI> of the Age crown'd him with their
just <HI>Laurels,</HI> when they said,
<Q><HI>Marlborough</HI> who knew, and durst
do more than all.</Q>
There is one noble <HI>Invention</HI> that was
there <HI>tributary</HI> to your <HI>Lordships</HI> success,
I mean that of <HI>Guns:</HI> But as great and
noble as this <HI>Invention</HI> is, (and which
was found out by a <HI>German</HI> in the <HI>Year
1378.</HI> and whereby the Lives of Men,
if we reckon by <HI>wholesale,</HI> are better
preserved in the defence of Cities, and
by the fate of Victory being sooner decided
in Camps, that hinders Armies from so
much butchering one another as former∣ly)
it hath been by snarling <HI>Writers</HI> of
great Name maligned; and because by
it some Men were killed by <HI>retale,</HI> it
hath been render'd <HI>execrable</HI> and <HI>dia∣bolical;</HI>
and that not only by <HI>Poly∣dore
Virgil,</HI> but by <HI>Cardan</HI> and <HI>Me∣lancton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="33"/>Nor need it be told your Lordship how
much this <HI>Invention</HI> hath been improved
since its first use. The manner of con∣triving
and applying them hath not been
less improved than the way of preserv∣ing
light for the Passengers in our streets,
since the finding out of <HI>Lanthorns</HI> hath:
The only <HI>Author</HI> I know, who hath re∣corded
the <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Lanthorns</HI> is our
learned Antiquary Mr. <HI>Gregory,</HI> in his
learned <HI>Notes</HI> on <HI>Ridley</HI>'s <HI>View,</HI> &amp;c.
He there tells us, <HI>p. 286. That the In∣ventor
of Lanthorns was our King</HI> Alu∣red,
<HI>in whose dayes the Churches were
of so poor and mean a structure, that
when the Candles were set before the
Relicks, they were often blown ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by
the Wind which got in, not only</HI> per
Ostia Ecclesiarum, <HI>but</HI> per frequent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s pa∣rietum

Prince was put to the practice
of his dexterity, and by occasion of
this</HI> Lanternam ex lignis &amp; bovinis

<HI>by an apt composure of thin Horns
in Wood, he taught us the Mystery
of making Lanthorns.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="l" REF="34"/>But our <HI>New</HI> invented <HI>Glasses</HI> and
<HI>Lamps,</HI> that casting out so powerful and
extensive, and withal so durable and
chearful an Illumination, as to make Mens
passing about their Affairs in the Night
not only <HI>tolerable</HI> but <HI>pleasant,</HI> have
much outdone the <HI>Lanthorns</HI> invented by
our <HI>Monarch, in diebus illis.</HI></P>
<P>Yet on the publishing of a Paper con∣taining
the various uses this Invention
might be of to the Nation, and where∣in
it was mention'd <HI>inter alia,</HI> that <HI>these
Lights might for the publick good be
employed at the Light-houses, which
give directions to Sea-faring People in
dark and stormy Nights; and that these
Lights being so clear and strong, and
continued with so much certainty as
might probably save many from Ship∣wrack,
where the usual Coal-fires or
Candles often fail, by either not giving
sufficient Light, or by the uncertainty
of these Lights, subject to so many ac∣ciden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
as doth often occasion the great
losses both of Men, Merchandize and
Vessels:</HI> The Patentees of these New
Lights being invited to discourse with
those that have the Charge, and re∣ceive
<PB N="li" REF="34"/>
the profits of the Light-houses, they
said, they thought they came to save
their Candles, but since the Oyl necessa∣ry
to maintain these Lights (though a
Pint, which would cost about a Groat,
they were told would serve one Lamp burn∣ing
twelve hours) was dearer than Can∣dles,
they declined the use of these
Lamps; whereupon the Patentees telling
them, they thought the saving of Men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Lives and Goods to be of more import∣ance
than the saving a few Candles, de∣sisted
from further application.</P>
<P>I might here too instance in the In∣vention
of the Scarlet or <HI>Bow-dye,</HI> the
exportation whereof hath brought us in
return so much Treasure, was put to it
to make its way into the World through
much opposition. And thus is, and was,
and always will the <HI>birth</HI> of every <HI>New</HI>
Art and Science be of difficult <HI>parturi∣tion,</HI>
and the <HI>Inventors</HI> be enforced to
cry, <HI>Fer opem Lucina,</HI> I mean, to <HI>crave
aid</HI> and Patronage from such generous
and <HI>Heroical</HI> and publick spirited men as
your Lordship.</P>
<P><PB N="lii" REF="35"/><HI>My Lord,</HI> about eighty Years agoe
the <HI>Invention</HI> of the <HI>New-River-Wa∣ter</HI>

the <HI>six</HI> days Work and <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall the
World was yet a kind of <HI>Chaos</HI> as to the
use and service of Man, till necessity and
humane Industry set his Reason to work,
and by degrees to invent and contrive how
to apply and dispose the things he found
therein best for his ease and service; and
teeming <HI>Nature</HI> goes still big with new <HI>In∣ventions</HI>
to improve the things we have,
and is ready to bring them forth, when∣ever
Philosophical and Industrious Men
lend her their Midwivery: And for this
purpose I am thinking, it was a noble and
ingenious saying of <HI>Seneca, Pusilla res
mundus est, nisi in illo quod quaerat om∣nis
mundus habeat,</HI> Senec. Nat. Qu. <HI>l.</HI> 2.
par. 3. i. e. <HI>The World were a poor little
thing, but for its affording ample mat∣ter
<PB N="liii" REF="35"/>
of research and enquiry to all suc∣ceeding
Ages.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> there is another incompa∣rable
<HI>Invention</HI> that was found out not
many Years since, and which without some
such Patriotly <HI>Hero</HI> as your Lordship
awakening the <HI>Age</HI> about it, is likely to
fill up the Number of <HI>lost things;</HI> and it
is the <HI>New Engine</HI> that so much exceeds
all formerly used for the eternal preser∣vation
of our <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers, by <HI>deep∣ening</HI>
them, and making them every where
<HI>Navigable,</HI> and taking away all <HI>Ob∣structions</HI>
and <HI>Shelfs</HI> in a very short
time. Sir <HI>Martin Beckman,</HI> the <HI>chief
Engineer of</HI> England, and as I am in∣formed
the ingenious Sir <HI>Christopher
Wren,</HI> their Majesties Surveyor Gene∣ral,
have given their approbation there∣of;
and as likewise did King <HI>Charles</HI>
the <HI>second,</HI> who was highly pleas'd there∣with,
and declared after he had seen the
working of the <HI>Engine,</HI> which in his Ma∣jesty's
presence took up about a Tun and
an half in little more than a Minutes
time, that he was perfectly satisfy'd it
would answer the end proposed; and that
by means of its working <HI>horizontally,</HI> it
<PB N="liv" REF="36"/>
made no holes, but rather fill'd such as
lay in the way of its working, and left
the bottom of the River level as it wrought,
whereby such inconveniencies would be a∣voided,
as had happened from the com∣mon
<HI>Ballast-Lighters</HI> making such great
<HI>Holes</HI> in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and in
which several of the Kings as well as
Merchants Ships coming to an Anchor,
had broke their backs.</P>
<P>And his Majesty having been made ac∣quainted
that this <HI>Engine</HI> being sent down
below <HI>Bridge</HI> to <HI>Berking-shelfe,</HI> where
is nothing but hard <HI>Shingle,</HI> and that
after half an hours breaking ground, it
took up at 19 Foot deep, about two Tuns
in a Minute and a half, during the whole
time it wrought, he said thereupon, <HI>That
he thought there was no way practica∣ble
for the deepening the River of</HI>
Thames, <HI>and removing Shelfes therein,
but by this Engine.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Engine</HI> was <HI>invented</HI> by Mr. <HI>Bay∣ly,</HI>
an excellent Engineer, and much cul∣tivated
and improved to its perfection by
the great <HI>Expence</HI> of Mr. <HI>Joseph Co∣tinge.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> so often going
<PB N="lv" REF="36"/>
down that <HI>River</HI> in his Barges and
<HI>Yachts,</HI> took occasion thereby often to con∣sider
the State thereof, insomuch that up∣on
a publick <HI>Hearing</HI> in <HI>Council,</HI> that
the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> and <HI>Aldermen</HI> had up∣on
their Complaint against Patents that
<HI>straiten'd</HI> the <HI>River,</HI> and licenced <HI>En∣croachments</HI>
on it, he took occasion to
speak it openly, that <HI>the River was shal∣lower
before his Yard at</HI> Deptford <HI>by
three Foot since his Restauration, and
that if it should be but a Foot shallow∣er
there, his Ships that did ride at An∣chor
there would be spoiled.</HI></P>
<P>But I have heard Mr. <HI>Shishe,</HI> the
<HI>Master-builder</HI> there, and likewise Sir
<HI>Phinehas Pett,</HI> who was formerly Ma∣ster-builder
there, and afterward at <HI>Chat∣ham,</HI>
averr, that the <HI>River</HI> is there ve∣ry
near <HI>four Foot,</HI> if not altogether, <HI>shal∣lower</HI>
than it was at that King's Restau∣ration;
insomuch that their Majesties
Ships there (as likewise in the <HI>River</HI> of
<HI>Medway</HI> at <HI>Chatham)</HI> do <HI>ground</HI> about
<HI>four Foot</HI> before they have <HI>Water</HI> enough
to <HI>wind</HI> up with the <HI>Tide</HI> of <HI>flood,</HI> the
which doth very much strain and wring
them to their great prejudice, and that <HI>if
<PB N="lvi" REF="37"/>
there be not a speedy course taken to
remove some Encroachments, and pre∣vent
all future ones, and the farther
stopping up those Rivers with sullage,
those two Royal Rivers will be spoiled,
and in a short time useless for Capital
Ships riding therein, and the Crown be
put to immense Charge in purchasing
of ground for other Ship-yards, and in
making of Docks and Store houses, and
building new Dwelling-houses for the
Officers of the Yards.</HI></P>
<P>I remember, visiting my worthy Friend
Mr. <HI>Brisband,</HI> who was Secretary to the
former <HI>Lords Commissioners for the
Admiralty,</HI> he entertain'd me with the
fight of many <HI>Papers</HI> in his <HI>Office</HI> that
related to the Applications that had been
made by the <HI>City of London</HI> to that
<HI>Board,</HI> for the preservation of the River
of <HI>Thames,</HI> and one of them was a Pa∣per
of the City's <HI>Reasons</HI> against the <HI>Pa∣tents</HI>
for <HI>Licensing</HI> Encroachments, and
straitning that River, and which seem'd
to me very <HI>weighty,</HI> and drawn with
such great care and pains, that what
<HI>Councellor</HI> soever drew them, I am sure
he deserved a very large Fee from the
<PB N="lvii" REF="37"/>
City; and out of which I <HI>noted</HI> down
this Passage, namely, <HI>That if that River
were spoiled, the great Trade of</HI> Eng∣land
<HI>would be transplanted, not to
other Sea-port-Towns in</HI> England, <HI>but
to Forreign Parts.</HI> Those <HI>Reasons</HI> men∣tioning
<HI>Patents</HI> of the <HI>Soil</HI> to the low-water-mark
on both sides the River, in∣ferr,
<HI>That without speedy care taken,
the River will be so straiten'd as to be∣come
thereby not only useless, but even
hurtful to Shipping, by a violent and ra∣pid
course of the Tide that will then
necessarily ensue:</HI> And the City there∣in
Complains of a <HI>Lease</HI> made of a great
part of the <HI>Soil</HI> of the <HI>River,</HI> and that
<HI>the right of the disposal of the Shoar of
the River, or the Conservatorship there∣of,
may by survivorship accrue to a
Colour-man in the</HI> Strand.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Brisband</HI> informed me, that those
<HI>Commissioners</HI> of the <HI>Admiralty</HI> as well
as the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> had taken a great
deal of pains in the preserving of the <HI>Ri∣ver,</HI>
and that it was <HI>incumbent</HI> on <HI>both</HI>
their <HI>Offices</HI> so to do; for which purpose
he shew'd me a most <HI>judicious</HI> and learn∣ed
<HI>Report</HI> made by the <HI>Judge</HI> of the <HI>Ad∣miralty,</HI>
<PB N="lviii" REF="38"/>
wherein it was said, That <HI>the
Admiral is by his Office and Patent
not only</HI> Custos Maritimarum partium,
<HI>but</HI> Custos portuum &amp; Conservator Flu∣minum
infra fluxum &amp; refluuum ma∣ris;
<HI>and that he is by his Patent em∣powered
to make Sub-conservators,
and hath by the Statute of</HI> primo Eli∣zabethae
<HI>a concurrency with the Lord
Mayor of</HI> London <HI>in the Conservator∣ship
of the River of</HI> Thames, <HI>and that
the Shoar of the River is a part of the
River, and ought not to be held by
private Persons, as of their own right,
but by those Conservators in trust for
the Government.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>in fine,</HI> that <HI>Secretary</HI> acquaint∣ed
me, that there was to be a <HI>Survey</HI> of
the <HI>River</HI> and the <HI>Encroachments</HI> on it,
to be made by <HI>Trinity-house</HI> and <HI>Navy-Board,</HI>
with the assistance of <HI>Captain</HI>
Collins <HI>the King's Hydrographer:</HI> And
I have since seen a <HI>Copy</HI> of that <HI>Sur∣vey</HI>
made accordingly, and great pains
was therein taken. The great pleasure
I have taken in going down that River
in Boats and Barges, made me always
wish well to the State of it; but the sight
<PB N="lix" REF="38"/>
of the Papers before mention'd, inclined
me to account it a <HI>Patriotly</HI> thing to pro∣mote
its preservation by all the means I
could, and gave me occasion to reflect on
the great <HI>Wisdom</HI> and Care of the <HI>Pub∣lick</HI>
that appear'd in our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> when
they made the <HI>Admiral</HI> and <HI>Lord Mayor</HI>
the <HI>Conservators</HI> of it; after the exam∣ple
of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> as <HI>Gryphiander</HI>
in his learned Book <HI>de Insulis,</HI> p. 430.
quotes several places out of the <HI>Civil
Law,</HI> to shew, that they appointed their
<HI>Hydrophylacas,</HI> or <HI>Conservators</HI> of their
great <HI>Rivers,</HI> and deliverers of them from
being choaked up with <HI>Annoyances</HI> and
<HI>Shelfes;</HI> and he there <HI>p.</HI> 441. cites <HI>A.
Gellius</HI> for the <HI>ratio retandi flumina, id
est, purgandi à Virgultis, arboribus∣que
in alveo Natis, ne impedimento sint
navibus,</HI> practised by them: And he
saith, that <HI>simili verbo returandi usus
est Nonius quod est obturando contra∣rium,</HI>
Turneb. <HI>l.</HI> 28. advers. 12. And
then speaking of the <HI>Engines</HI> they used to
that end, he saith, <HI>In quem usum In∣strumenta
hydrautica deducendis, hau∣riendisque
aquis inventa sunt, de qui∣bus
Vitruvius,</HI> l. 10. <HI>quem explicat
<PB N="lx" REF="39"/>

l. 4. c <HI>de Excus. Mun.</HI> l. 10. <HI>Dala∣camp.
ad Plin.</HI> l. 7. c. 37.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Engines</HI> are long since gone a∣mong
<HI>lost things:</HI> Nor do I think we
need wish any other <HI>Engine</HI> for the purg∣ing
the River of <HI>Thames</HI> from Obstructi∣ons,
than this I have referred to: And
according to the common Observation of
<HI>Providence</HI> taking care to send both new
Diseases and Remedies into the World in
the same Conjuncture, and often from
the same place, (as for example the <HI>Lues
Venerea</HI> and <HI>Guacum,</HI> and <HI>Sassafras</HI> from
the <HI>West Indies</HI>) it was worthy of its
care for <HI>England,</HI> that at this time,
when this our <HI>River,</HI> on which de∣pends
the <HI>Fate</HI> of our <HI>Nation</HI> is labour∣ing
under the most <HI>critical</HI> state it ever
kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, and is ready to be destroy'd, to
offer us such an <HI>Engine</HI> for its being re∣stored
to such a good Condition of being
Navigable, as its <HI>Conservators</HI> can wish.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> There is one thing that
hath caused most horrible ill effects to this
<HI>River,</HI> and which I have met with no
Man who hath observ'd, and therefore
<PB N="lxi" REF="39"/>
it is fit it should be known; and that is
the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>London:</HI> For every <HI>five
Yards</HI> of <HI>Pavement</HI> a load of <HI>Gravel</HI> is
used, and a great part of this <HI>Gravel</HI>
lyes so loose, that by the force of the Rain
it is frequently driven into the <HI>Sewers</HI>
and the <HI>Thames:</HI> And every <HI>Pavement</HI>
raiseth the <HI>Street</HI> paved <HI>two Inches</HI> at
least; but the <HI>burn'd</HI> part of <HI>London</HI> is
at a <HI>Medium</HI> four <HI>Foot</HI> higher: And
so I account that by the <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Re∣building</HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> more <HI>Gravel</HI> and
<HI>Soyl</HI> hath gone into the <HI>Thames</HI> than
perhaps will again in the next three hun∣dred
Years.</P>
<P>Some who are interested in this <HI>En∣gine,</HI>
have said, that by it the <HI>Bar</HI> of
<HI>Dublin</HI> might be taken away; but I have
heard that that is a <HI>rocky</HI> Barr; and
if so, such effect of the <HI>Engine</HI> is not to
be expected: But that such <HI>Shelfes</HI> ari∣sing
in our River from the <HI>Gravel</HI> and
<HI>Sullage</HI> that are wash'd into it, may with
ease be removed by it, is not to be doubt∣ed.</P>
<P>This <HI>River</HI> glides along with a much
more clear and gentle stream than the
River of <HI>Severn;</HI> and the Cause of the
<PB N="lxii" REF="40"/>
<HI>clearness</HI> of its Water, is its running in
a Gravelly Valley, and over a clear
Ground: And the great <HI>winding</HI> of the
River, which locks in the Water that
it cannot make that haste down to the
Sea that it would, and the low-lying of
the <HI>Head-springs</HI> of it, from whence there
is but an easie descent to the Sea, are
the two chief Causes of the gentleness of
its Current: It may be here remark'd,
that this easie descent of the Waters to
the Sea-ward, is another reason why the
<HI>Tide</HI> flows up so high into the heart of
this River; for the more steep the Ri∣ver
is, the less able is the Tide to force
its way up into it. Swift Rivers have
always their Heads lying high, or their
Course direct, or both.</P>
<P>Since I have been (as I may say) a
<HI>Student</HI> of this <HI>River,</HI> I have took oc∣casion
to pitty those who look on the strange
<HI>shifting</HI> of <HI>Tides</HI> in this <HI>River</HI> as a great
<HI>Prodigy,</HI> because happening seldom: But
I think the Cause of the <HI>shifting</HI> of the
<HI>Tides,</HI> is only the over-bearing of their
Course, when they are at their slackest,
by a <HI>Northwest</HI> Wind, which is the most
powerful adversary they can have on our
<PB N="lxiii" REF="40"/>
Coasts: For if a slow <HI>Ebb</HI> be encoun∣ter'd
full in the teeth with a hard Storm,
what can follow but a return of the Tide
back again? And if the <HI>Northwest</HI>
Wind either abate its fierceness, or shift
into some other quarters, as the <HI>South-west</HI>
or <HI>North-east</HI> for some short time,
and then either return to its former place,
or resume its former force, and do this
once, twice, and again (which we know
is not inconsistent with the Nature and
Custom of the Wind off at Sea, thô at
Land its wanderings are not altogether
so sensible) we may easily believe (see∣ing
so plain a reason for it) that there
will be a playing of the Tide too and
fro, and several Floods and Ebbs suc∣ceeding
one another in a few hours space.
My Sentiments in this place are those of
the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Britannia Baconica.</HI> It
was the Praediction of <HI>Campanella,</HI> that
<HI>Venice</HI> should at last be destroy'd by <HI>Obli∣mation,</HI>
that is, by the <HI>Sullage</HI> of its
Waters that should spoil their being Na∣vigable.
And <HI>Gryphiander</HI> in his Book
before mention'd, hath a great deal of <HI>cu∣rious</HI>
Learning, to shew what famous <HI>Ri∣vers</HI>
in the World had been <HI>destroy'd</HI> by

<P>This great part of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> name∣ly,
the <HI>Conservation</HI> of all the <HI>Royal
Rivers</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> hath been always by
our Kings deposited in the hands of the
<HI>Lord High Admiral of</HI> England <HI>and</HI>
Ireland; and the trust thereof is both
granted to our <HI>Admirals</HI> in all their <HI>Pat∣tents,</HI>
and is <HI>inherent</HI> in their <HI>Office;</HI>
and in all the <HI>Patents</HI> of the <HI>Viceadmi∣rals</HI>
of the maritime <HI>Countyes</HI> in both
Realms, the <HI>Viceadmirals</HI> are <HI>expresly</HI>
constituted <HI>Conservators</HI> of all the <HI>Royal</HI>
Rivers and <HI>Ports</HI> belonging to those Coun∣ties,
as Mr. <HI>Brisband</HI> inform'd me upon his
having perused the draughts of many <HI>Vice∣admirals</HI>
Patents; I thereupon asking him
whether those Viceadmirals did put their
<PB N="lxvii" REF="42"/>
power of being <HI>Conservators</HI> of the Royal
<HI>Rivers</HI> in execution; he told me that upon
his having consulted some of the Offices and
Officers in the high <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Admiral∣ty</HI>
about this very thing, he could find
no foot-steps of their having minded the
Power of such Conservacy: <HI>That he ob∣serv'd
them diligent enough in that part
of their Office that enabled them to re∣ceive
several Admiralty Perquisites and
Droits, of the which they were Col∣lectors
for the use of the Admiral, and
to whom they often gave their accounts
about the same; but that he never found
in the Accounts of their Disbursments
any thing inserted of a Penny charge
they ever were at in the demolishing
any Nusances, or removing any Shelfs
in the Royal Rivers; and that the do∣ing
this being a thing of great charge,
and they having no allowance of any
Sallary to support their Office, this
Work was never expected from them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus then have Eneroachers took what
liberty they pleas'd, to make Purprestures
on the Royal Rivers in the Countrey, and
to build Houses thereon as seem'd good
in their own eyes; and it hath there been,

Admiralty, that Licenses have been gi∣ven
by the Lord Admiral for the en∣largement
of Wharfs, and that the said

have been made from time to time for
the regular lying of Ships, by appoint∣ing
how many shall ride a breast, <HI>&amp;c.
and the</HI> Report <HI>mentions, that one</HI> was

which</HI> Deed <HI>was dated the</HI> 22d. <HI>of</HI> Ja∣nuary,
<HI>in the</HI> second <HI>Year of the late

<PB N="lxx" REF="44"/>
<HI>with some Sea-faring People, inhabitants
by the</HI> Thames-side <HI>in</HI> Wapping, <HI>that</HI>
neither he nor his Heirs and Assigns
will build any House or Wharf on the
Soil between their Houses and Ground
and the Low-water-mark; <HI>which ne∣cessarily
shews that he claim'd a Power
of so doing if he would.</HI></P>
<P>But at the <HI>Admirals</HI> granting <HI>Licen∣ses</HI>
for the <HI>Enlargement</HI> of <HI>Wharfs</HI> I
do not wonder, tho' yet there is no doubt
but that both the <HI>Admiral</HI> and <HI>Lord
Mayor</HI> as <HI>Conservators</HI> of the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> have administred that branch
of the <HI>Regalia candidè &amp; castè,</HI> and
with great precaution, with reports after
references to sworn <HI>Surveyors,</HI> that the
<HI>River</HI> would not be damnify'd by such
enlargement of Wharfs, causing any <HI>Jet∣tys</HI>
to obstruct the course of the <HI>Tide</HI> in
carrying away the <HI>Sullage;</HI> a thing that
generally happens by the <HI>Encroachments</HI>
that private Persons have <HI>presumed</HI> to
make on the River.</P>
<P>And here I shall take occasion to ob∣serve,
that it is not only possible in some
Cases to take in some part of the River
without prejudice to it, but it is also pro∣bable
<PB N="lxxi" REF="44"/>
that the taking in some places of
the River would tend to the good of it.
The general Rule is, that we may with
safety to the River <HI>gain</HI> upon the hollow
shore, but not on the <HI>Convex</HI> Shore, or
where there are <HI>Head-lands;</HI> for then it
would <HI>change</HI> the <HI>Channel</HI> and turn the
<HI>stream</HI> into <HI>Eddys;</HI> as for example, If
the <HI>Custome-House-Key</HI> should be car∣ry'd
further, which is already brought to the
<HI>Channel,</HI> it would be fatally mischievous.</P>
<P>It hath been by several skilful <HI>Survey∣ors</HI>
told me, that after the Fire of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
they upon the digging the foundati∣on
of the present <HI>Custome-house,</HI> found
that it was all such as we call <HI>made
Earth,</HI> and had been gain'd out of the
<HI>Thames,</HI> and therefore it was (I ac∣count)
with great Prudence, that the
<HI>Conservators</HI> of the <HI>River</HI> consented,
that 'till they came to <HI>deep</HI> Water,
it should be gain'd in for the better
Convenience of Navigation, that Ves∣sels
might float at ebb as they now do
at the Custome-house.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Surveyors</HI> assured me that
under <HI>St. Magnus</HI> Church they after the
Fire met with an old Campshot and
<PB N="lxxii" REF="45"/>
Wharfing, gain'd from the <HI>Thames,</HI> and
that at the same time they were inform'd
that there were found Campshots much
further from the <HI>Thames</HI> in digging of
Cellars; and whence it may be inferr'd
probably, that all <HI>Thames-street</HI> from
<HI>Queenhithe</HI> downward to the <HI>Custome-house,</HI>
was gain'd out of the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>I give no <HI>hint</HI> of this, that any Pro∣jector
may take occasion from hence to begg
<HI>Thames-street.</HI> God be thanked, the
illegality of granting <HI>Forfeitures</HI> before
<HI>Conviction</HI> is <HI>now</HI> out of fashion. All
<HI>vexatious</HI> or <HI>prolling Patents</HI> are now
in the State of <HI>damnati antequam Na∣ti:</HI>
And it must be acknowledged to the
immortal praise of that true English-man,
Sir <HI>George Treby,</HI> the <HI>Attorney Ge∣neral,</HI>
that he finding their Majesties
Names surreptitiously used in the Prose∣cution
of such a <HI>Patent,</HI> did that great
Iustiee to the Honour of the Government,
and to his own Character, as to cause a
<HI>Cesset Processus</HI> to be enter'd in the
Case.</P>
<P>When I consider the many Patents,
both illegal and <HI>vexatious</HI> that passed in
the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>second,</HI>
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="45"/>
I call to mind that <HI>Maxime,</HI> that <HI>the
King can do no wrong;</HI> that is, he can
in no <HI>Grant cum effectu,</HI> injure his Peo∣ple,
but by some of his Ministers in the
Law passing it, and who in so doing may
be said, <HI>Violare Sacramentum Domini
Regis.</HI> I believe that that excellent
<HI>Prince</HI> did in his Nature wish well to the
<HI>Ease</HI> of his People as well as his own,
while by the fault of some of his Ministers
so many <HI>Grants</HI> surreptitiously did pass of
the <HI>Same conceal'd</HI> Lands, and of <HI>Purpre∣stures,</HI>
and of Lands <HI>derelicted,</HI> &amp;c. and
when after <HI>Composition</HI> paid by the <HI>People</HI>
to one Court-beggar, he sent another to their
doors; and when the suffering Populace,
whose pretended <HI>Forfeitures</HI> were granted
before <HI>Conviction,</HI> were so often tempted
to cry out, <HI>Quem das <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inem Rex mag∣ne
laborum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was in that Reign excellently well
said by the</HI> Earl <HI>of</HI> Shaftsbury, <HI>in his</HI>
Speech <HI>in the</HI> Exchequer, <HI>at</HI> Serjeant
Thurland'<HI>s being sworn a</HI> Baron <HI>there,
viz.</HI> Let me recommend to you, so to
manage the King's Justice and Reve∣nue,
as the King may have most pro∣fit,
and the Subject least Vexation:
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="46"/>
Raking for old Debts, the number of
Informations, Projects upon conceal∣ments,
I could not find in the eleven
Years experience I have had in this
Court, ever to advantage the Crown:
But such Proceedings have for the most
part deliver'd up the Kings good Sub∣jects
into the hands of the worst of Men.
<HI>And Sir</HI> William Petty <HI>in a</HI> Manuscript
<HI>I have seen of his,</HI> of the Trade of <HI>Ireland,
for this purpose, taking Notice of the seve∣ral</HI>
Trades <HI>by which People there subsist,
speaks of many there driving the Trade of</HI>
Projectors, <HI>and of such who make use of
the</HI> King'<HI>s Name, and the</HI> Process <HI>of the</HI> Ex∣chequer,
<HI>about concealed Lands, to spunge
Composition out of such as are willing to
buy their Peace; and he having shew'd
how much the</HI> King <HI>is damnified by those</HI>
Traders, <HI>he saith very judiciously in the
end,</HI> That this Trade doth not add any
thing more to the Common-wealth than
Gamesters, and even such of them as
play with fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Dice, do to the common
stock of the whole Number.</P>
<P>It is here therefore but just to take no∣tice
of the <HI>Prudence</HI> of the <HI>Trinity-house,</HI>
in that after they had on the
<PB N="lxxv" REF="46"/>
18<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> in the 15th. <HI>Year</HI> of
that King's <HI>Reign,</HI> pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Letters Patents,</HI>
not only of the <HI>Ballast</HI> of the <HI>River</HI> of
<HI>Thames,</HI> but also of all the <HI>Wast ground,
Purprestures and Encroachments, and
Soil to it belonging;</HI> they soon found
that it would engage them in Controver∣sies
with the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Sea∣men</HI>
and <HI>Sea-saring</HI> People, and there∣fore
surrender'd it, and the <HI>Surrender</HI>
was <HI>enroll'd</HI> in <HI>Chancery</HI> the 9<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>De∣cember,</HI>
in the 16th. <HI>Year</HI> of that <HI>King;</HI>
and on the 24th. of <HI>June,</HI> in the <HI>follow∣ing</HI>
Year, they took out <HI>Letters Patents</HI>
for the <HI>Ballast</HI> alone. But there were
<HI>Patents</HI> passed of the <HI>same</HI> Encroach∣ments
<HI>Prior</HI> to the <HI>Patent</HI> of <HI>Trinity-house</HI>
as well as <HI>after</HI> it; and it may be
said, that on those <HI>after</HI> it, the <HI>Paten∣tees</HI>
came a <HI>gleaning,</HI> not only after the
<HI>Reapers,</HI> but after the <HI>Beggars,</HI> since
whatever <HI>Trinity-house</HI> receives, is only
for the use of the <HI>Poor:</HI> However, the
<HI>Trinity-house</HI> in taking out that <HI>Patent</HI>
for <HI>Encroachments</HI> on the <HI>Thames,</HI> was
made use of afterward as an <HI>Example</HI> or

from one of the King's Council at

from <HI>all the Sea-port Towns in</HI> England
to oppose it, as likely to be <HI>troublesome</HI>

<P>I thank God for his inclining me to▪

giving any man the least Offence to get
the greatest profit to my self, <HI>equal</HI> with

<HI>Offic.</HI> And were I commanded to write
the History of the Reign of any Prince,
and therein in proper Colours to delineate
any of the Ministers at Law to him who
violated the ease of his fellow Subjects, by
the <HI>illegal</HI> passing of <HI>Grants</HI> of <HI>Forfei∣tures</HI>
before <HI>Conviction,</HI> I should trans∣mit
his Character to Posterity, in the
words of <HI>Vir natus ad corruptissimum
<PB N="lxxvii" REF="47"/>
istius saeculi Genium:</HI> But the <HI>Genius</HI>
of the <HI>Age</HI> is now for the making it self
easie by its <HI>spewing up</HI> such Patents:
And the benefit the People find thereby,
doth in a modest Computation outweigh
all the Taxes they pay to the Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>The Magistrates of our <HI>Metropolis</HI> are
now eased from the labour of going in their
<HI>Formalities,</HI> and with a <HI>Parade</HI> of City-officers
attending them to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> to
seek relief as formerly in the Reign of that
Prince.</P>
<P>And I may for the Edification of the
Citizens of our <HI>Metropolis</HI> in Loyalty,
fairly take occasion here to mind them,
that when (as the Story is in <HI>Howel</HI>'s
<HI>Londinopolis,</HI> p. 19.) King <HI>James</HI> the
first, being displeas'd with the City of
<HI>London</HI> for their refusing to lend him
Money, told the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Aldermen</HI>
attending him, that he would remove his
Court, and the <HI>Tower</HI> Records, and
Courts of <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> to some other
remote place; and an <HI>Alderman</HI> then
ask'd him, <HI>if he would remove the Ri∣ver
of Thames?</HI> that if the <HI>Alderman</HI>
thought that an <HI>impossibility,</HI> he was cer∣tainly

<P>For upon a discourse I had with a most
sk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lful <HI>Surveyor,</HI> on the occasion of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell∣ing
h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m that I thought whoever b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgain'd
away that part of the Shoar that was be∣fore
mention'd, <HI>viz.</HI> 80 Foot <HI>deep,</HI> and
100 Foot <HI>long,</HI> for 20 l. sold <HI>Robin
Hood's Penny worths</HI> of it, his Measures
agreeing with mine therein, and that ma∣ny
a Man would have given 500 l. for the
same; I found on the Result of our Confe∣rence
how the <HI>Crown</HI> might <HI>grant</HI> away but
a <HI>Moity</HI> of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> name∣ly,
the <HI>Shore</HI> to the <HI>Low-water-mark</HI> on
both sides, (and which would in effect de∣stroy
the whole River as aforesaid) and
gain the value of four Aldermens Estates
by it.</P>
<P><HI>For thus his</HI> Calculation <HI>was,</HI> viz.
<HI>to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w that whoever gave</HI> 500 l. <HI>for it,
would gain</HI> 200 l. <HI>by the bargain.</HI> To
go into the <HI>Thames</HI> 100 Foot long be∣low
Bridge, will cost a Man 300 <HI>l.</HI> with
the slighter sort of Wharfing. If he
goes 80 Foot deep, he hath it fill'd for
nothing with rubbish; so then he gives
500 <HI>l.</HI> and giveth 300 <HI>l.</HI> more for the
charge of his Whar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: And he may gain
<PB N="lxxix" REF="48"/>
200 <HI>l.</HI> by the bargain by the ground<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rents,
thus, <HI>viz.</HI> He may build forward
and backward on the Premises, and
may compute the ground rent by 6 or
7 <HI>s.</HI> the front Houses <HI>per</HI> Foot, and 2 <HI>s.</HI>
6 <HI>d. per</HI> Foot the back Houses; so then
there being in a Mile above 5000 Foot,
he will gain in one Mile 50 times 200,
that is, 10000 <HI>l.</HI> and the like on the
other side; and so proportionably for
another Mile on both sides; <HI>Quod erat
demonstrandum.</HI></P>
<P>There were by the appointment of King
<HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>second</HI> two <HI>Surveys</HI> made of
the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Thames,</HI> the one of the se∣veral
<HI>depths</HI> of the <HI>River</HI> in its parts be∣low
Bridge, perform'd with great Care
and Skill by that excellent Mathematical
Person, Sir <HI>Jonas Moor,</HI> and a <HI>Copy</HI>
of which I can direct the <HI>Conservators</HI>
of the <HI>River</HI> where to obtain for an in∣considerable
Charge.</P>
<P>The other was a <HI>Survey</HI> of the <HI>En∣croachments</HI>
I before referred to, per∣form'd
by the <HI>Navy-Board</HI> and <HI>Trini∣ty-house,</HI>
with the <HI>assistance</HI> of Captain
<HI>Collins,</HI> his Majesties <HI>Hydrographer,</HI>
and wherein I said great pains was taken;
<PB N="lxxx" REF="49"/>
and a <HI>Copy</HI> whereof is herewith publish'd
for the use of the <HI>Conservators</HI> of the <HI>Ri∣ver,</HI>
and I can direct them to Captain
<HI>Collins</HI> his most accurate <HI>Draught</HI> of the
<HI>River,</HI> and most necessary to be had by
them: And he in my judgment deserves
to be well rewarded with some acknow∣ledgment
by the City for the great <HI>Pains</HI>
taken, and <HI>Skill</HI> by him shewn in that
<HI>Draught,</HI> tending to the preservation of
their River: For he hath thereby laid an
everlasting <HI>Foundation</HI> for the easie and
certain <HI>Prevention</HI> of all <HI>future</HI> Encroach∣ments
on the <HI>Thames,</HI> and which may be
this way, and I believe cannot possibly be
effected by any other; namely, if the
Lords <HI>Commissioners</HI> for executing the
<HI>Office</HI> of the <HI>Lord High Admiral</HI> shall ap∣point
the <HI>Marshal</HI> of the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> or
some other Person, and the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI>
appoint his <HI>Water-Bailiff</HI> at the <HI>mend∣ing</HI>
or <HI>repairing</HI> of any <HI>Wharf</HI> upon the
<HI>Thames,</HI> to see a <HI>Stake</HI> stuck down, be∣yond
which the <HI>Repairers</HI> of the <HI>Wharf</HI>
shall not proceed; and both of these Offi∣cers
shall be order'd to demolish immedi∣ately
whatever shall be added beyond such
Stake. Captain <HI>Collins</HI> his <HI>Draught</HI> doth
<PB N="lxxxi" REF="49"/>
sufficiently set forth how far the <HI>Encroach∣ments</HI>
went that were made before the
<HI>Month</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> 1684. the Month
in or about which he gave in his Draught,
and to which this printed <HI>Survey</HI> re∣ferrs.</P>
<P>Vpon my consulting the Authors that
write of the <HI>Regalia,</HI> to know their sense
of the Office of a <HI>Conservator,</HI> I found
this <HI>definition</HI> of it there, <HI>viz. Conser∣vator

any <HI>moot-point</HI> in our Law that need

<P>His Majesty and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l his People, both

long sufficiently acquainted with the Do∣ctrine
of <HI>Nusa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces,</HI> since the <HI>passing</HI> of
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="50"/>
the <HI>Act</HI> against <HI>Irish Cattel,</HI> and that a
<HI>Patent</HI> for a <HI>Nusance</HI> was not worth its
weight in burnt Silk: And he hath been
often heard to say, that <HI>he would damn
all Patents that damned the River;</HI> and
that the granting of things to the <HI>Low-water-mark</HI>
must needs be <HI>vexatious;</HI> for
that the <HI>Neap tides</HI> and <HI>Spring-tides</HI> be∣ing
so <HI>various</HI> at different times of the
<HI>Month,</HI> and different times of the <HI>Year,</HI>
beside all variety of Wind and Weather
from abroad, the great uncertainty of
such Grants must make perpetual disturb∣ances
among his Subjects; and that if
any presumed to take in the River to what
may seem the <HI>Low-water-mark,</HI> that
then Ships <HI>lying</HI> by the <HI>Walls</HI> would en∣crease
the <HI>Mudd</HI> there, and add to the
dirt thrown in, and that that might be
built on too, and so the River be anni∣hilated.
And he being inform'd that the
Person who had made that Encroachment
so prejudicial to the River, and which he
purchased for 20 <HI>l.</HI> was only <HI>Fined</HI> by my

for it, was resolved to have it <HI>demo∣lish'd,</HI>

to <HI>terrifie</HI> Encroachers for the <HI>future;</HI>
<PB N="lxxxiv" REF="51"/>
for that he well knew the demolishing of
that one <HI>Encroachment</HI> would spoil the

<P><HI>Nor is it to be wonder'd at, that his</HI>

of the</HI> Council-Board, <HI>when they were

I shall here take occasion to
mention what I find in Sir</HI> Julius Caesar<HI>'s</HI>
Manuscript Collections <HI>of Matters of</HI>
State, <HI>that after King</HI> James <HI>had grant∣ed
the</HI> Conservacy <HI>of the River of</HI> Tyne

<HI>Complaints were brought to the</HI>

were order'd to be put in execution for
the remedying the Abuses complained

<HI>Trinity-Masters</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> should draw
up additional Articles to be joyn'd with
the former, for the effectual Conserva∣tion
of that River: <HI>And one of them
was,</HI> That some truly trusty substantial
Men, Burgesses of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> be ap∣pointed
to View the River every Week,
and to make Oath of the abuses done to
the same; two of them to be Masters
of the <HI>Trinity-House</HI> of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and
they to have no Coles, nor Mines, nor
Ballast-shores, and who might be
thought not concern'd for their own
profit in casting Sullage into that Ri∣ver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Government</HI> then thought not fit
to make any Men <HI>Guardians</HI> of the Soil
of that River, who had a pretence by Pa∣tents
to <HI>inherit</HI> it.</P>
<P>In short, when the <HI>Sun</HI> is just come in∣to
its Winter-<HI>Tropic,</HI> the <HI>dayes</HI> begin
to lengthen, and not 'till then; and when
things were at the <HI>worst</HI> with the River
of <HI>Tyne,</HI> they did then begin to mend:
And the Wisdom of the Government
shew'd its <HI>Dominion</HI> over all the <HI>Starrs,</HI>
<PB N="lxxxvi" REF="52"/>
whose influences threatned that Royal Ri∣ver:
<HI>Dictum, factum;</HI> and that <HI>Ri∣ver</HI>
is preserv'd to this day, and so I hope
with Gods help will the River of <HI>Thames,</HI>
and all our <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers be for ever.</P>
<P>It was the saying of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the
first, <HI>Deus aeterne nisi vigilares quam
male esset mundo, quem regimus ego
miser Venator &amp; ebriosus ille Julius.</HI>
The <HI>Viceadmiral</HI> of the <HI>County,</HI> and the
<HI>Mayor</HI> of <HI>Newcastle</HI> were in that Con∣juncture
<HI>drowsie Conservators</HI> of that
River; but <HI>Divine</HI> Providence was then
awake to preserve that great useful Ri∣ver,
and to awaken the Government to
take those Measures for its preservation
that were necessary, and suitably to which
a <HI>fac simile</HI> might easily be taken on oc∣casion
for any other of our Royal Ri∣vers.</P>
<P>There is another of the <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers
where the great Concern of <HI>Navigation</HI>
did so wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thily employ the time of the
<HI>Council-Board</HI> in the Reign of King
<HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>first:</HI> For one <HI>Morgan</HI> ha∣ving
built a <HI>House</HI> at <HI>Crockyern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ill,</HI>

for <HI>Ships</HI> and <HI>Barks</HI> being fasten'd to
them) the Lords of his Majesties Coun∣cil
upon a Complaint of that <HI>hindrance</HI> to
<HI>Navigation,</HI> made an <HI>Order</HI> that <HI>Mor∣gan</HI>
should <HI>demolish</HI> and pull down that
<HI>House,</HI> that so Posts might remain there
as formerly, for the fastening of <HI>Ships;</HI>
as may appear by two several <HI>Orders</HI>
made at <HI>Council-Board,</HI> the one bearing
<HI>date</HI> the 11<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> An. 1670. and
the other the 29th. of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>And if any <HI>private</HI> Person may <HI>abate</HI>
a <HI>Nusance,</HI> even before prejudice re∣ceiv'd,
none need make it a Question whe∣ther
the <HI>King</HI> or his <HI>Privy Council</HI> may,
or Persons by them Commission'd so to
do.</P>
<P>Because (as we say) that which is eve∣ry
body's work is no body's, for that rea∣son
the <HI>Law</HI> hath entrusted that power of
<HI>abating Nusances</HI> in the <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers
to the <HI>Lord High Admiral,</HI> as their <HI>Con∣servator,
ex Officio;</HI> and here for the
doing that in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> the
<HI>Lord Mayor</HI> hath been admitted to that
trust; and it is <HI>vested</HI> in <HI>both</HI> of their
<HI>Offices,</HI> both by <HI>Grant</HI> and <HI>Prescription,</HI>
according to that <HI>distinction</HI> so often used
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="53"/>
among the Writers of the <HI>Regalia, cu∣mulativè</HI>
but not <HI>privativè;</HI> that is to
say, by the <HI>accumulating</HI> the power of
<HI>Conservacy</HI> both to the <HI>Lord Admiral</HI>
and the <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI> neither of them is
<HI>deprived</HI> of it. Neither would either be
<HI>deprived</HI> of the exercise of their <HI>Power</HI>
of demolishing <HI>Nusances,</HI> if the <HI>King</HI>
should grant a <HI>Commission</HI> to many other
particular Persons so to do: Nor yet
would the <HI>Commissionating</HI> of <HI>many</HI> other
such Persons <HI>deprive</HI> the rest of their fel∣low
Subjects of their right so to do.</P>
<P>And here it is <HI>obvious</HI> to be said by the
way, that thô a <HI>Patent</HI> that pretends to
<HI>grant</HI> Encroachments or <HI>Nusances</HI> is void,
yet a <HI>Patent</HI> or <HI>Commission</HI> to throw them
down is most certainly very <HI>legal.</HI> But
yet if any Man were so <HI>publick-spirited</HI>
as without a <HI>Patent</HI> to attempt a thing so
<HI>beneficial</HI> to his Countrey, he would be
able to effect it with as much readiness as
that <HI>honourable</HI> Person, who hath on ma∣ny
Accounts deserv'd so well from his Coun∣trey,
the Earl of <HI>Craven,</HI> without <HI>Patent</HI>
or <HI>Commission,</HI> or a <HI>Parade</HI> of <HI>Officers</HI>
and gilded <HI>Maces</HI> going before him, hath
been long obey'd in the quenching of Fires.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxix" REF="53"/><HI>My Lord,</HI> I believe the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion
is <HI>doubled</HI> in populousness, since the
ancient Methods were first used of trust∣ing
the Care of <HI>Conservacy</HI> of the <HI>Roy∣al</HI>
Rivers in the Countrey to our <HI>Vice∣admirals,</HI>
whose so long <HI>Non-user</HI> of their
power relating to the Encroachments on
them, hath sufficiently appear'd by the ma∣ny
Patents of those Encroachments in the
several Countreys granted in the <HI>Reign</HI> of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, and the which
hath beside the inconvenience of the strait∣ning
those Rivers, produced another to
our Navigation, namely, the Creating
much trouble by innumerable Law-suits
to our <HI>Navigators,</HI> who generally inhabit
by the sides of those Rivers, and where
their Ships use to lye: And it is pitty but
that some Clauses should have been insert∣ed
in those <HI>Patents,</HI> to direct a different
way of <HI>Prosecution</HI> in their Case from
that of other Subjects, and that unless ve∣ry
<HI>enormous</HI> prejudice had come by their
<HI>Encroachments</HI> to the <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers, the
<HI>Seamen</HI> might not have been put to it to
give Compositson-money for the <HI>licensing</HI>
their Nusances. It hath been truly ob∣serv'd
<PB N="xc" REF="54"/>
by a late Writer, <HI>That Seamen
are easily tempted to seek good Enter∣tainment
in other Countreys, if they find
it not in their own, and that they are
apt to change their own Quarters, and
embarque in Forreign Service, some∣times
upon a Capricio of their reputing
themselves disobliged at home, and at
other times on their expectance of be∣ing
better used abroad. And in a Re∣monstrance
from</HI> Trinity-house <HI>to the
Earl of</HI> Nottingham, <HI>Lord high Admi∣ral,
it was certify'd by them to his
Lordship, that in a little more than 12
Years after 1588. the Shipping and
Number of our Seamen were decay'd
about a third part.</HI></P>
<P>It seems by the wise <HI>Conduct</HI> of the
Government then, our <HI>Sea-men</HI> and their
numbers were carefully <HI>enroll'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But so indulgent was Queen</HI> Elizabeth
<HI>to the</HI> Seamen <HI>in her Reign, that we find
in the</HI> Act <HI>of</HI> Parliament, 35 Eliz. <HI>c.</HI> 6.
An Act for restraining of New Build∣ings,
<HI>a particular tender regard is had
to the</HI> Seamen; <HI>for there it is said,</HI> Pro∣vided
also notwithstanding any thing in
this Act, it shall and may be lawful for
<PB N="xci" REF="54"/>
every such Mariner, Sailor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as
shall be allow'd by the Lord Admiral,
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Masters and Company of the
<HI>Trinity-House</HI> for the time being, in
writing under their Hands and Seals to
continue in his habitation in any House
that hath been built sithence the said
Proclamation, near to the <HI>Thames</HI>-side,
serving only for the habitation of such
Mariner, and not to be used for any
Victualling-house, nor for any House
for any Merchandize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and likewise
that any Mariner may hereafter build
any House for such purpose, and for no
other, on or near the <HI>Thames</HI>-side, so
as it may be distant from the very
Wharf or Bank thirty Foot, so as Peo∣ple
may pass between the said Houses,
and the said Bank and the <HI>Thames,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I speak not this as if I would have any
Mariners make any new Encroachments
on any of our Royal Rivers, especially on
the <HI>Thames,</HI> which is already so much
straiten'd: But I urge it to shew how the
<HI>Wisdom</HI> of the Government then did
make it (as I may say) a <HI>fundamental</HI>
Rule for the Preservation of the <HI>River</HI>
of <HI>Thames,</HI> that even while encourage∣ment
<PB N="xcii" REF="55"/>
was providing for the Sea-men, (the
Walls of the Kingdom) yet Houses by the
<HI>Thames</HI> should not be permitted, but by
the <HI>Allowance</HI> of the <HI>Admiral,</HI> the great
<HI>Conservator</HI> of all the <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers, and
the <HI>Trinity-house,</HI> first had under their
Hands and Seals. Several of the Mem∣bers
of the <HI>Trinity-House</HI> dwelling by the
<HI>Thames</HI>-side below Bridge, cannot but as
they go up and down by Water, take no∣tice
of the Encroachments as they are ma∣king,
and which of them will eminently
prejudice the River, and which not, and
so are the more proper to be consulted in
the Case.</P>
<P><HI>And from hence we may Collect this
great</HI> Document, <HI>and so necessary to be
thought of</HI> again <HI>and</HI> again, <HI>by the</HI> Con∣servators
<HI>of our</HI> publick <HI>Rivers, namely,
That</HI> whatever alteration is made in
them, by building on them, thô never
so little, ought to be with great Care,
and with the use of the <HI>Consilium peri∣torum,</HI>
and not by the arbitrage of pri∣vate
Patentees and their Executors, but
by the Publick Conservators, to whose
personal Circumspection and Skill that
great trust was always committed by
<PB N="xciii" REF="55"/>
the Government; <HI>the</HI> Office <HI>of the</HI> Ad∣miral
<HI>having never been granted by</HI> In∣heritance,
<HI>as some great Offices,</HI> viz. <HI>the</HI>
Earl Marshal <HI>and</HI> Lord Great Cham∣berlain
<HI>have been.</HI></P>
<P>And there is another <HI>instance</HI> of the
<HI>ancient</HI> Care of the <HI>Government</HI> over the
River of <HI>Thames,</HI> that is very <HI>memo∣rable,</HI>
namely, the excellent Institution
of the <HI>Wardmote Inquest,</HI> the which
thing hath worthily made the Govern∣ment
of the City of <HI>London</HI> so famous
all over the World.</P>
<P><HI>I have read the Articles of the</HI> Charge
<HI>of the</HI> Wardmote Inquest, <HI>that were in
print in Queen</HI> Elizabeth<HI>'s time, where∣of
the</HI> 4th. Article <HI>is,</HI> Ye shall swear
that ye shall enquire and truly present
all the Offences and Defaults done by
any Person or Persons in the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> according to the intent and
purport of an Act made by our late So∣vereign
Lord King <HI>Edward</HI> the 6<HI>th.</HI> in
his High Court of Parliament, and also
of divers other things, ordain'd by Act
of Common Council of this City, for the
redress and amendment of the said Ri∣ver,
which as now is in great decay
<PB N="xciv" REF="56"/>
and ruine, and will be in short time past
all remedy, if high and substantial Pro∣vision
and Help be not had with all
speed and diligence possible, as more
plainly appeareth in the said Act of Par∣liament,
and the said Act of Common-Council
of this City.</P>
<P>Here the most grave and substantial
Citizens, are put to it by a <HI>promissory</HI>
Oath to <HI>stake</HI> their Eternities, and in
effect to <HI>invocate</HI> God, both as <HI>Witness</HI>
and <HI>Revenger,</HI> about their doing right
to that <HI>River</HI> in their <HI>Presentments;</HI> and
I am sure the present State of it being
conformable to the <HI>Words,</HI> in that Arti∣cle
relating to <HI>its great decay and ru∣ine,</HI>
&amp;c. is what they may safely swear
in an Oath <HI>assertory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Howel</HI> in his <HI>Londinopolis,</HI> p. 392.
speaks of this <HI>Article</HI> still continuing in
Presentments in the <HI>Wardmote In∣quest.</HI></P>
<P>When the Government did anciently
order the <HI>Lord High Admiral</HI> and the
<HI>Lord Mayor</HI> to <HI>espouse</HI> the Interest of
this <HI>River,</HI> our <HI>Monarchs</HI> did not pre∣sent
to them, as one did who told a <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Emperor, he offer'd him a <HI>Lady,</HI>
<PB N="xcv" REF="56"/>
who was <HI>Vidua &amp; indotata.</HI> As much
as it hath been (as I may say) <HI>widdow∣ed,</HI>
and bereaved of that Care it should
have found, while many now living re∣member
at least a <HI>fifth</HI> part of it to have
been taken in by <HI>Encroachers,</HI> it brings
in still a very fair and plentiful <HI>Dow∣er</HI>
to the <HI>Lord Admiral</HI> and <HI>Lord May∣or.</HI>
The <HI>Lord Admiral</HI> hath been by it
enabled to support the <HI>Trinity-House</HI> by
the <HI>Ballast-Office;</HI> and I in my Conscience
think it well bestow'd on them, that is
to say, on the poor <HI>Seamen</HI> whom that
excellent <HI>Corporation</HI> relieves thereby.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chainage</HI> of <HI>Ships</HI> belongs to the
<HI>Admiral,</HI> and the right of the <HI>Ferriage</HI>
over all Rivers between the <HI>first</HI> Bridges
and the Sea is a Perquisite of <HI>Admiralty,</HI>
and the right thereof is <HI>inherent</HI> in the
<HI>Office</HI> of the <HI>Admiral;</HI> and 'tis <HI>notori∣ous</HI>
that the <HI>Right</HI> of the <HI>Ballastage</HI> in
all the other <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers of <HI>England</HI>
belongs to the <HI>Admiral,</HI> as well as in the
River of <HI>Thames.</HI> There is the Perqui∣site
of <HI>Anchorage</HI> in the <HI>Thames,</HI> as
well as elsewhere, belonging to the <HI>Ad∣miral,</HI>
as are likewise many other <HI>Per∣quisites,</HI>
and that are enumerated in the
<HI>Admiral</HI>'s Patent.</P>
<P><PB N="xcvi" REF="57"/>Nor can any <HI>Right</HI> belonging to the
<HI>Admiral</HI> be pass'd by the Crown under the
<HI>Great Seal</HI> to any one but by the <HI>Admi∣ral</HI>'s
Warrant to the <HI>Attorney</HI> or <HI>Soli∣citor</HI>
general.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> as <HI>Water-bay∣ly</HI>
and <HI>Conservator</HI> of the <HI>River</HI> of
<HI>Thames,</HI> several <HI>Fees</HI> and <HI>Profits</HI> be∣long:
And to that <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>Conservator</HI>
belongs the <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>Measuring Coals,
Grain, Fruit,</HI> in the <HI>Port</HI> of <HI>London,</HI>
with the <HI>Fees</HI> belonging to it; and the
<HI>Fines</HI> imposed in his <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Conserva∣cy,</HI>
or by the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of <HI>Sewers</HI>
for Misdemeanors that concern the <HI>Ri∣ver;</HI>
and other Perquisites, and in the
which the <HI>Admirals</HI> have long ceased to
intermeddle; and not without cause, be∣cause
of the great Charge incident to the
Lord Mayor's <HI>Conservacy</HI> of the River,
and particularly in matters relating to the
<HI>Fishery,</HI> and the charge that attends the
traversing Indictments, and removing
them to the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> as likewise the
Charge of suing out <HI>Scire Facias</HI> 'es to va∣cate
the Grants of particular Persons that
entrench on the rights of the <HI>Lord May∣or</HI>'s
Conservacy, and which Charge they
<PB N="xcvii" REF="57"/>
have often supported without being there∣in
assisted by the <HI>Lord Admirals.</HI></P>
<P>I might instance in many passages in the
reigns of our Kings long ago, concern∣ing
the <HI>Lord Mayor's</HI> applying to the Go∣vernment,
when private Courtiers had
surreptitiously obtain'd <HI>Patents</HI> that <HI>in∣terloped</HI>
in the <HI>Conservacy</HI> of the Ri∣ver;
as for example, <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI>
having made a <HI>Grant</HI> to the <HI>Earl of Pem∣broke</HI>
for <HI>setting up a Weare in the
River of</HI> Thames, and the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI>
applying to the King about it, obtain'd a
<HI>Scire Facias</HI> to <HI>vacate</HI> that <HI>Grant,</HI> and
vigorously prosecuted the <HI>vacating</HI> there∣of
to effect.</P>
<P>And how in the two last Reigns seve∣ral
<HI>Lord Mayors</HI> with great Industry and
Charge prosecuted the <HI>vacating</HI> of Patents
that they judged entrenching on the Con∣servacy,
that both by <HI>Charter</HI> and <HI>Pre∣scription</HI>
belong'd to them, is known to
every one: Nor will the unwearied dili∣gence
of those Patriotly <HI>Lord Mayors,</HI>
Sir <HI>William Pritchard,</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Tulse,</HI>
Sir <HI>James Smith,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Jefferys,</HI>
Sir <HI>John Peak,</HI> in thus shewing their
Zeal for the <HI>Conservacy</HI> of the <HI>River,</HI>
<PB N="xcviii" REF="58"/>
be ever forgot, while that City keeps Re∣cords.</P>
<P>And they are strangers to the Chara∣cter
of the present <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI> both for
integrity and prudence in <HI>Political</HI> Con∣duct,
and his <HI>Zeal</HI> for maintaining the
known Rights of the City, who shall think
that if he had been at the Helm of them
Government of the City when they were,
he would not have steer'd the same Course
as the most active of them did, and that
with such a Courage as is worthy the high
<HI>Sphere</HI> of Magistracy he moves in. <HI>A
Coward</HI> (saith one) <HI>cannot be a good
Christian, much less a good Magistrate.</HI>
Solomon<HI>'s Throne of Ivory was support∣ed
by Lyons. Innocency and Integrity
cannot be preserved in Magistracy with∣out
Courage. Magistrates are great
Blessings,</HI> Modo audeant, quae sentiunt,
<HI>if they dare do their Conscience.</HI>
<Q>Me quae te peperi ne Cesses Thorna tueri,</Q>
was the ancient <HI>Inscription</HI> of the <HI>Bridge-house
Seal,</HI> and which may give an oc∣casional
hint to any Citizen of <HI>London,</HI>
advanced to Authority and Opulency
<PB N="xcix" REF="58"/>
therein, to wish well to the <HI>defence</HI> of
that <HI>River</HI> that hath so long <HI>bred</HI> and
preserv'd the Riches of that City.</P>
<P>I am here led to observe, how that Ri∣ver
being pester'd by various Annoyances
in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th.</HI> and the
Lord Mayor's Offices being made unea∣sie,
and hinder'd in the Conservacy of
the River; the <HI>City</HI> apply'd to the King
for a <HI>Proclamation,</HI> who accordingly issu∣ed
out one in the 34th. <HI>Year</HI> of his <HI>Reign,</HI>
strictly requiring, <HI>That none should pre∣sume
to resist, or deny, or impugne
the Lord Mayor or his Deputies, in
doing or executing any thing that might
conduce to the Conservacy of the Ri∣ver,</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>And methinks the Customary <HI>yearly</HI>
Solemnity of the New <HI>Lord Mayor</HI>'s at∣tended
with all the <HI>City Companies</HI> in
their Barges on the <HI>Thames,</HI> and there
on that River above Bridge having their
first <HI>Scene</HI> of Triumph, as they are go∣ing
to <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> to be <HI>sworn,</HI>
should give them occasion to think often
of that Rivers preservation in the fol∣lowing
part of the Year.</P>
<P><PB N="c" REF="59"/>I am here led to call to mind a fatal
danger that that River above Bridge
escaped in the Reign of the late <HI>King,</HI>
when some were so hardy as to offer him a
Proposition, and in the way of a <HI>Project</HI>
to enlarge his Revenue by straitning the
River, and by building another <HI>Street,</HI>
between the high and low-water-mark,
from the <HI>Bridge</HI> to <HI>White-Hall.</HI> But
thô so great a <HI>straitning</HI> of the River there
would not have been so prejudicial to the
publick as lesser straitnings of it below
bridge, where the great Scene of Navi∣gation
lyes, yet his Majesty with great
judgment gave a peremptory denyal to the
Proposition, for this particular reason,
namely, that such an alteration in the
River might perhaps produce an alterati∣on
in the Tide of Flood, and be the cause
of its not flowing so many hours as it doth,
and which effect too he thought the build∣ing
of a <HI>Bridge</HI> at <HI>Lambeth</HI> (a Project
that some offer'd to his Consideration)
might produce, it being obvious that the
Obstacle the course of the Tide meets
with by <HI>London bridge,</HI> doth much oc∣casion
the Tide of Flood being the short∣er.</P>
<P><PB N="ci" REF="59"/>And if great Care had not been taken
by the <HI>Trinity-house,</HI> in the government
of their <HI>Ballast-Lighters,</HI> and ordering
them not to draw up Ballast too near the
<HI>Banks</HI> of the River, there would have
been great danger of another accident that
might have curtail'd the Tide of Flood;
I mean by their coming nearer to the shoar
than the safety of the great <HI>Level</HI> by
<HI>Limehouse</HI> will admit. In the same time
that they can draw up one <HI>Tun</HI> of Ballast
in deep Water, they may draw up <HI>three</HI>
near the shoar. A <HI>breach</HI> in that <HI>Level</HI>
did within these few Years cost the Pro∣prietors
25000 l. a <HI>third</HI> part of the va∣lue
of the Land: And if a new greater
breach came, perhaps it would not be re∣pairable,
and possibly cause the <HI>Thames</HI>
not to flow up so far as it did, and yet
doth. But any thing of this Nature we
may well hope will be prevented by the ex∣cellent
<HI>Management</HI> of the Ballast-Office,
by the industry of that <HI>Virtuous</HI> and <HI>Pru∣dent</HI>
Lady, the <HI>Lady Brooks,</HI> who hath
the <HI>Lease</HI> thereof from the <HI>Trinity-house,</HI>
and hath taken much more Care of its be∣ing
managed for the good of the River,
than was took formerly.</P>
<P><PB N="cii" REF="60"/>I forgot when I was just now consider∣ing
the Affair of the Annoyances and
<HI>Streightning</HI> of the <HI>River</HI> above Bridge,
to mention it, that a <HI>Gentleman</HI> of the
<HI>Temple,</HI> who has not been many Years
a <HI>Barrester,</HI> told me, <HI>He remembers
that since he was of that Society, the
River at low-water came up so far as
to touch the Garden-wall;</HI> and every
one knows at what great distance it is now
from the Wall at low-water.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I have here given your
great active thoughts the best entertain∣ment
I could upon our <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers, and
particularly on the <HI>Thames.</HI> Great men
are like the heavenly bodies that find
much veneration but no rest, unless we
find a <HI>Salvo</HI> for their having the latter,
by saying what the <HI>Philosophers</HI> do of
the Heavens, that <HI>Movendo quiescunt.</HI>
And whoever will be just to your Lord∣ship,
must acknowledge that you have
esteem'd your self most at your ease and
rest, while in the high Orb Fate hath
placed you in, you have been most active
and busie in blessing the World with your
i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fluences. Your Lordship need not be di∣rected
<PB N="ciii" REF="60"/>
to that <HI>Moral</HI> remark, that your
<HI>private</HI> good is included in the publick,
<HI>Tanquam Trigonum in Tetragono.</HI>
And as in Nature we see that all bodies
do by their own <HI>proper</HI> Center tend to the
<HI>Center</HI> of the <HI>Universe,</HI> so they that know
your Lordship, know it is natural to you
by your tendency to your own Welfare and
Happiness to endeavour to promote the
bliss of your Countrey in all the wayes you
can.</P>
<P>Your Lordship is no stranger to what the
<HI>Roman</HI> Poet saith of <HI>Caesar,</HI>
<Q><L>—media inter praelia Caesar,</L>
<L>Astrorum Coelique plagis, superisque vacabat.</L></Q></P>
<P>And therefore if his great mind could
in the heat of Battel find leisure to em∣ploy
it self about the imaginary Circles in
the Heavens, and which only <HI>salve</HI> the
<HI>appearances,</HI> I believe if presently after
you had charged in a Battel, I had hint∣ed
to you some of the great matters before
mentioned, that are as real as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se three
great Foundations of real Learning can
make any thing, I mean, number, weight,
<PB N="civ" REF="61"/>
and local motion, and matters on which
the <HI>Salus Populi</HI> doth absolutely depend,
your <HI>Lordship</HI> would have given me the
hearing. And having said this, I shall
not doubt but that now you are by Pro∣vidence
brought to support the Crown and
your Countrey, by the great Figure you
make in the <HI>Council</HI> and <HI>Parliament,</HI> and
in the peaceable administration of the Ci∣vil
Government, your Lordship will there∣in
be as vigilant for the publick as ever
you were in War.</P>
<P>Nor to a <HI>Soul</HI> so refined as your <HI>Lord∣ships</HI>
could any War but what is in order
to Peace seem eligible; and when in the Case
of any degenerate stupid Members of
Mankind, who are deaf to all Reasons
for their being happy, or suffering others
to be so, you are call'd to <HI>awaken</HI> the
World out of its <HI>Lethargy</HI> with the sound
of <HI>Drums</HI> and <HI>Trumpets.</HI> But it is an
easier and gentler way of awakening any
of our Magistrates, whom you may judge
to be sometimes drousie in the Admini∣stration
of those great trusts reposed in
them by the Government, that I here most
humbly offer to your Lordships thoughts,
and particularly as to the publick concern
<PB N="cv" REF="61"/>
in the <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervacy</HI> of the publick <HI>Rivers,</HI>
and the Care of which in this growth of
the populousness of our Countrey, and
overgrowth of the abuses done to those Ri∣vers,
may well call for the <HI>Supervisor∣ship</HI>
of some particular Person or Persons,
who either being Commission'd for their
Conservacy under the <HI>Crown,</HI> or the
<HI>Commissioners</HI> of the <HI>Admiralty</HI> may
really Conserve them.</P>
<P>Nor need the <HI>Vice-admirals</HI> Commissi∣ons
on this occasion be alter'd. Let them
be nominal <HI>Conservators</HI> still, and <HI>real</HI>
ones too as far as they please. Nor need
any the least deduction be made from, or
intrenchment on any <HI>Fees</HI> taken by the
<HI>Lord Mayor</HI>'s deputy Water-bayly or <HI>Sub-Conservators</HI>
for the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Thames,</HI>
as I find him <HI>styled</HI> in that Book of <HI>How∣el,</HI>
where he <HI>p.</HI> 35. treating of the <HI>State
of the Lord Mayor,</HI> saith, <HI>He hath
a Sword-bearer, Common-hunt, and
Common Cryer, and four Water-Bay∣liffs,
Esquires by their Places;</HI> whether
he there makes <HI>three</HI> too many, I know
not, I have formerly heard of <HI>one</HI> too
many. But thô neither <HI>Mayor</HI> nor <HI>Ad∣miral</HI>
can erect a <HI>New</HI> Court of <HI>Justice</HI>
<PB N="cvi" REF="62"/>
without an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> or <HI>Let∣ters
Patents</HI> from the Crown, yet com∣mon
reason tells us they may make as ma∣ny
<HI>Sub-Conservators</HI> or <HI>Deputies</HI> for
the <HI>Ministerial</HI> work in the <HI>Conservacy</HI>
of the River as they please. And if any
one publick spirited Man were either by
the <HI>Crown</HI> or <HI>Admiral</HI> entrusted with the
Conservacy of the other <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers, he
might for each of them employ what hands
he pleas'd. <HI>Quod quis per alium facit
per se facere videtur.</HI></P>
<P>According to the vigilance and pru∣dence
of the former <HI>Commissioners</HI> of
<HI>Admiralty,</HI> in effecting the before men∣tion'd
<HI>Survey</HI> of the <HI>Encroachments</HI> on
the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and likewise the
<HI>Draught</HI> of the <HI>River</HI> by <HI>Captain Col∣lins,</HI>
the like <HI>Surveys</HI> and <HI>Draughts</HI> of
all the other <HI>publick</HI> Rivers beneath
the <HI>first Bridges,</HI> may in a Years time
or thereabout be prepared, the which
draughts of the respective Rivers being
fairly set out in <HI>Frames,</HI> may usefully
be hung up as Ornaments in a Galle∣ry
in the House of such general <HI>Con∣servator</HI>
for the time being, and be
left to his Successors to have the Cu∣stody
<PB N="cvii" REF="62"/>
of. And to such Draughts recourse
may easily be had by any of their Maje∣sties
<HI>Ministers</HI> of State, or Officers in the
<HI>Admiralty Court</HI> or <HI>Navy,</HI> or by the <HI>Tri∣nity
house,</HI> upon occasion. Such <HI>Surveys</HI>
and <HI>Draughts</HI> being skilfully and accu∣rately
prepared, and some <HI>Elbows</HI> of
<HI>Wharfs</HI> and <HI>Jettys</HI> being taken away,
whereby the sides of the Rivers may as
much as is needful come toward the shape
of a <HI>right</HI> Line, the <HI>Course</HI> of the Ri∣vers
themselves will begin to Cure them
of their <HI>Sullage;</HI> and such <HI>Eddys</HI> as
caus'd the Water to settle with the
mud formerly be prevented: And these
<HI>Draughts</HI> of the Rivers serving as the
<HI>Standards</HI> by which all future Enlarge∣ments
or Diminutions of Wharfs or Banks
may be guided, will make it appear as <HI>ab∣surd</HI>
for Encroachers to break in upon
them thus reform'd and regulated, as it
doth to <HI>Clippers</HI> to <HI>incroach</HI> on our <HI>cu∣rious</HI>
new <HI>Mill'd</HI> Moneys and the <HI>Letters</HI>
about their Edges, and as absurd for any
to begg Patents from the Crown to take
in the <HI>Lines</HI> of our publick <HI>Rivers,</HI> as the
<HI>Letters</HI> of our Coyn.</P>
<P><PB N="cviii" REF="63"/>And thus after a little diligence
and resolution employ'd in the first set∣ling
of this work, the constant Con∣servacy
of all our Royal Rivers, would
be comparatively easie, the populace see∣ing
that the Government was in earnest
in the thing, and as it appear'd to be in
the Conjuncture before mention'd, when
the Magistracy did <HI>rouze</HI> it self for the
preservatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Tyne.</HI></P>
<P>Who would have thought that after the
<HI>Survey</HI> of the <HI>Encroachments</HI> on the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Thames,</HI> and the Draught of that
<HI>River</HI> by <HI>Captain Collins,</HI> they should
be no more minded than if such a <HI>Survey</HI>
had been made of the <HI>Annoyances</HI> of the
<HI>Rhine</HI> or <HI>Texel?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Would any one think that after the vast
pains taken by the</HI> Trinity-House <HI>in go∣ing
down the River to perfect its Survey
so many times, in the extremity of Win∣ter-weather,
and many of them being</HI> Ve∣teran
<HI>Seamen, thereby contracting dan∣gerous
Colds, Coughs and Catarrhs, be∣cause
the Government required the</HI> Sur∣vey
<HI>to be made with all expedition; and
after that excellent</HI> Seaman <HI>and</HI> Hydro∣grapher,
<HI>Captain</HI> Collins, <HI>had in order
<PB N="cix" REF="63"/>
to the making his</HI> Draught <HI>of the River
exact, made so many weary steps in the
mud of the shore, yet many Summers af∣ter
Summers should pass without any thing
brought to effect for the good of the River,
or the abatement of one Causway or other</HI>
Nusance, <HI>and both</HI> Survey <HI>and</HI> Draught
<HI>be no more regarded than an old</HI> Alma∣nack
<HI>calculated for the</HI> Meridian <HI>of</HI> Paris
<HI>or</HI> Madrid? <HI>Nay, which is more, can it
be imagin'd that Captain</HI> Collins, <HI>a Per∣son
of great integrity, should relate it to
another such Person,</HI> That he within this
Year or thereabouts, going to see the
sides of the River formerly survey'd,
and to find what effects the Survey and
his Draught had there produced, that
he there found Stone-wharfs built into
the <HI>Thames</HI> for three or four hundred
Foot in length, and from ten to thirty
Foot in breadth; and that he found a
great many other smaller Encroach∣ments
on both sides of the Water, and
several new Causeways, which in time
would raise the Mud equal to the su∣perficies
of the Causways; and that he
acquainting the City-Officer entrusted
with the Care of the Concerns of the
<PB N="cx" REF="64"/>
River therewith, had from him instead
of thanks a ruffianly Answer? <HI>yet these
very words of the</HI> Captains <HI>speaking were</HI>
Noted <HI>down from his Mouth by the Per∣son
to whom he spake them. Thus is the</HI>
Case <HI>of the Rivers</HI> Survey <HI>and</HI> Abate∣ments
<HI>of its Nusances, like that in the</HI>
Epigrammatist,
<Q><L>Eutrapelus tonsor dum Circuit ora Lu∣perci</L>
<L>Arraditque genas, altera barba subit.</L></Q></P>
<P>His dilatory <HI>Shaving</HI> occasion'd a <HI>New</HI>
Beards forth coming.</P>
<P>But that the <HI>Watermen</HI> may have no
cause to complain that they cannot <HI>Land</HI>
nor take in their <HI>Fare,</HI> if they may not
have that use of the <HI>Causways</HI> that the
<HI>Survey</HI> mentions as prejudicial, I shall
here say, that both their Fare and they
may be accomodated as well below Bridge
as above, by the Vse of a <HI>Truck</HI> or <HI>Board
with Wheels</HI> at the end next the Wa∣ter,
to move too and fro as the Tide comes
in or goes out, which may answer their
purpose.</P>
<P>And if those to whose Care the <HI>Con∣servacies</HI>
of the Rivers are entrusted as
<PB N="cxi" REF="64"/>
<HI>Depositories,</HI> may happen to tell your
Lordship that they are not at <HI>leisure</HI> to
mind the vigorous discharge of this trust,
a <HI>Reply</HI> may be had from the trite pas∣sage
of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s telling a Complain∣ing
Woman that he had no <HI>leisure</HI> to do
her <HI>Justice,</HI> and on which occasion she
said, that then <HI>he should have no lei∣sure
to be King.</HI> Most certainly he who
receives a <HI>Depositum,</HI> obligeth himself
to be at <HI>leisure</HI> to preserve it: And I
never knew any Iudge but who would find
leisure to <HI>ampliate</HI> and <HI>enlarge</HI> his Iu∣risdiction,
especially when he saw any
Men find leisure to try to diminish it.</P>
<P>There was one thing that seem'd to be
of some moment for the discouraging any
one from a belief of the likelyhood of any
of the <HI>Encroachments</HI> on the Royal Ri∣vers
being shortly removed, or of the
event of any Person of Honour or Qua∣lity's
being likely to undertake to serve his
Countrey therein; namely, the want of
any <HI>Fonds</HI> to support the Charge of such
Office. But as to which, it is obvious to
consider that the Law is open to compel
Encroachers to be at the Charge of <HI>abat∣ing</HI>
their own Encroachments, if able to
<PB N="cxii" REF="65"/>
do it, and wherein such especially who af∣ter
the <HI>Survey</HI> made <HI>Encroachments</HI>
on the <HI>Thames,</HI> will deserve little Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>And in the Case of <HI>Insolvents,</HI> the
<HI>Encroachments</HI> of <HI>solvent</HI> Persons that
shall by the <HI>Conservators</HI> be permitted to
continue, as consistent with the <HI>safety</HI>
of the Rivers, may easily be made to bear
that charge.</P>
<P><HI>I remember a Person employ'd by some
of the late Kings</HI> Ministers <HI>to discourse
Sir</HI> Robert Jefferys, <HI>when</HI> Lord May∣or,
<HI>about this Matter, acquainted me
that Sir</HI> Robert <HI>then moved it to the</HI>
Court <HI>of</HI> Aldermen, That a Committee
thereof might be appointed to meet at
his House with that Person, <HI>and he
there offering it to their Coasideration, as
the sense of those</HI> Ministers, <HI>that</HI> Com∣missioners
should be appointed by his
Majesty to make moderate Composi∣tions
with the Owners of such En∣croachments
as were not very prejudi∣cial
to the River, and were to be con∣tinued,
and the Charge of the demo∣lishing
the prejudicial ones might be
defray'd out of such Composition, and
<PB N="cxiii" REF="65"/>
that he desired to know whether they
had any thing to object against it. <HI>The</HI>
Lord Mayor <HI>and the rest of the Com∣mittee</HI>
unanimously <HI>declared that they
were very well</HI> pleas'd <HI>with the</HI> Pro∣position,
<HI>and did</HI> thankfully <HI>embrace
it.</HI></P>
<P>And no doubt but if the like way of
Compositions were order'd for such En∣croachments
as are to continue in the
<HI>Royal</HI> Rivers in the Countrey, the <HI>charge</HI>
of the demolishing some there, and of the
<HI>regulation</HI> of those <HI>Rivers,</HI> might not
only be thence <HI>defray</HI>'d, but a conside∣rable
summe of Money might be thence
brought in to support the Charge of the
Government, and that without any gain∣saying
or reluctance from the People, pro∣vided
that they might be deliver'd from
the <HI>vexatious</HI> Prosecutions of the many
Patents to private Persons for such En∣croachments;
to whom they have been in
a manner forced to give Money to <HI>re∣deem</HI>
their <HI>Vexation,</HI> rather than out
of hopes that they could buy a good Title
for the continuance of their <HI>Nusances.</HI>
And certainly the Condition of the
<HI>French</HI> Subjects being so ill on the ac∣count
<PB N="cxiv" REF="66"/>
of their being forced to buy <HI>Salt'</HI>
any Mens being harrass'd into the buy∣ing
such <HI>ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pid</HI> things (or as I may ra∣ther
say noxious) as Nusances, is a more
<HI>compassionable Case.</HI> This is humbly
offer'd to the Consideration of the <HI>Lords
Commissioners</HI> of the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> in
order to their offering it to the Conside∣rations
of their <HI>Majesties,</HI> or of the
<HI>House of Commons,</HI> (who are the grand
<HI>Inquest</HI> of the Kingdom) or of the <HI>House</HI>
of <HI>Lords,</HI> as they shall see occasion. And
perhaps if by their <HI>Application,</HI> a <HI>Clause</HI>
may be inserted in some new <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Par∣liament,</HI>
for the continuance of Peoples
Enchroachments that shall be compound∣ed
for by <HI>Commissioners</HI> in the respe∣ctive
<HI>Counties</HI> named in the <HI>Act,</HI> or by
their <HI>Majesties,</HI> they being by the Le∣gislative
power secured in their Titles
to such Encroachments, will no doubt be
chearfully ready to pay near the full Va∣lue
thereof.</P>
<P>The common <HI>Observation,</HI> that <HI>Pre∣rogative
in the Hand of the Prince is
a Scepter of Gold, but in the Hand
of the Subject a Rod of Iron,</HI> is appa∣rently
applicable to the Case of the <HI>Jubile</HI>
<PB N="cxv" REF="66"/>
such People will have, when freed from
the <HI>Vexations</HI> by <HI>Colour</HI> of Law given
them by the <HI>Proling</HI> litigious <HI>Instruments</HI>
employ'd under such Patents, who are usu∣ally
the <HI>Faex Populi,</HI> and may well bring to
our minds the saying of <HI>Solomon, A poor
Man that oppresseth the poor, is like a
sweeping Rain which leaveth no Food.</HI></P>
<P>I have been inform'd from Mr. <HI>L. J.</HI>
a worthy <HI>Bencher</HI> of the <HI>Temple,</HI> that
the poor People were so miserably <HI>harras'd</HI>
by the <HI>Agents</HI> employ'd in the Lady
<HI>S—ll</HI>'s Patent for <HI>derelict</HI> Lands, about
twenty Years since, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Ex∣chequer,</HI>
burden'd with Complaints about
it, Order'd, that <HI>no Process of the Court
should be further issued out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon it.</HI></P>
<P>I do studiously avoid the naming of
other <HI>Patents</HI> or the <HI>Patentees,</HI> or any
of their <HI>Instruments</HI> or <HI>Agents,</HI> and do
not desire to give our <HI>Admirals</HI> any trou∣ble
with reflections on such, however yet
in the course of my little reading in <HI>Par∣liament-Records,</HI>
I find that many Per∣sons
have been censured in <HI>Parliament</HI>
for <HI>taking out and procuring illegal
and vexatious Letters Patents from the
Crown.</HI> The <HI>Case</HI> of Sir <HI>Francis Mitchel</HI>
<PB N="cxvi" REF="67"/>
for his pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring a <HI>Patent</HI> of <HI>forfeited
Recognizances</HI> before <HI>Conviction,</HI> is
fresh in Memory.</P>
<P>Nor shall I here mention the <HI>Names</HI>
of those Patentees particularly, who gave
<HI>multitudes</HI> of the <HI>Seamen</HI> so much trou∣ble
at Law by their Patents for Encroach∣ments,
while they knew there were <HI>Prior
Patents</HI> in being for the <HI>same</HI> Encroach∣ments,
and that therefore no <HI>Action</HI> was
then <HI>maintainable</HI> by the <HI>latter</HI> Paten∣tees,
and that they could have no de∣sign
by bringing their innumerable <HI>Acti∣ons</HI>
against the <HI>Seamen,</HI> but to get <HI>Com∣position</HI>
out of them.</P>
<P>Nor shall I mention the Name of a
<HI>Waterbailiff,</HI> who was reflected on in
<HI>Council</HI> in the two last Reigns, for having
the <HI>Encroachers</HI> on the <HI>Thames</HI> for his
<HI>Tenants,</HI> and whom a late <HI>Lord Mayor</HI>
reproved very worthily on that account.
Nor shall I name a later <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI>
who instead of being a <HI>Conservator</HI> of
the River, appear'd as a <HI>Patron</HI> of <HI>En∣croachers,</HI>
by effecting it that a <HI>Ring-leader</HI>
of the Encroachers should be fined
only a <HI>Noble</HI> for an <HI>Encroachment,</HI> that
in the <HI>Survey</HI> of the <HI>Navy-Board</HI> and
<PB N="cxvii" REF="67"/>
<HI>Trinity-house</HI> is particularly <HI>branded</HI>
with its <HI>dimensions</HI> as <HI>prejudicial</HI> to the
<HI>Thames,</HI> and his being suffer'd to <HI>con∣tinue</HI>
that <HI>Encroachment;</HI> and the which
Favour his <HI>Lordship</HI> was known to shew
him at the request of a Person who was
by <HI>Name</HI> reflected on in <HI>The City Rea∣sons</HI>
before mention'd, as an <HI>Encroach∣er</HI>
of their <HI>Conservacy. The words
of the wise are heard in quietness;</HI> and
I therefore desire not to <HI>ruffle</HI> the <HI>Cares</HI>
of any of our Magistrates, from whom
the redress of these evils may be hoped,
by the noise of the <HI>Names</HI> of Persons. I de∣sire
that they may please to look <HI>forward,</HI>
not <HI>backward,</HI> and that at <HI>things</HI> rather
than <HI>Persons, &amp; nequid detrimenti capi∣at
publicorum fluminum Conservatio.</HI></P>
<P>And here it falls in my way to ob∣serve,
that supposing the <HI>Conservators</HI>
should not think it necessary in hast to
abate any Nusances, or to effect the raising
of any Revenue for the Crown, or <HI>Fond</HI>
for this Office on the Encroachments, yet
may the charge of the <HI>Office</HI> before men∣tion'd
be competently supported out of <HI>Ad∣miralty
Perquisites,</HI> either as they are
already <HI>vacant,</HI> or as they shall be; and
<PB N="cxviii" REF="68"/>
such <HI>Perquisites</HI> as to common reason
may seem most <HI>proper</HI> to be apply'd to a
<HI>publick</HI> use, and as I before mention'd
how the <HI>Ballast</HI> was. The truth is, con∣sidering
how little the standing <HI>Fees</HI> of
the <HI>Judge</HI> and other <HI>Officers</HI> of the High
Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> are proportion'd to
the great pains by them taken, and trust
in them reposed, and for how much a
greater income than yet belongs to <HI>Tri∣nity-house,</HI>
that is so useful a receptacle
as to the Charities to be bestow'd on de∣cay'd
<HI>Seamen,</HI> and their Widdows and
Orphans, and where they are to such with
so much exact Care apply'd, I have been
much troubled when I have heard of Ad∣miralty
<HI>Perquisites</HI> bestow'd formerly on
Courtiers and Voluptuaries, by whom the
Admiralty <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> and
the <HI>moral</HI> Offices incumbent on the same,
have not been promoted one jot.</P>
<P>But since the Nature of things doth
Call so loud for the speedy Settlement of
this <HI>Office,</HI> by which means only the <HI>Trust</HI>
in the <HI>Admiral</HI>'s Office can be discharg∣ed
for the prevention of <HI>future</HI> Encroach∣ments
on the <HI>Royal</HI> Rivers, and for that
<HI>frustra differtur remedium quod est
<PB N="cxix" REF="68"/>
unicum,</HI> it may be worthy the Care of
those honourable Persons who administer
that Office, to see some support provided
for that Office as soon as may be, and to
<HI>apply</HI> to the Crown or the Legislative
Power, as they shall find occasion, for any
thing to be done, necessary to the settle∣ment
and support thereof.</P>
<P>Both because the River of <HI>Thames</HI> is
the most principal of the Royal Rivers,
and for that the Countrey is naturally
in all things influenced by the Example
of <HI>London,</HI> the effectual <HI>Conservacy</HI> of
its River may well seem to require the
<HI>Priority</HI> of their Care. And here af∣ter
the example of the Government, that
as was before mention'd provided <HI>A.</HI> 1613.
for the preservation of the <HI>River</HI> of
<HI>Tyne,</HI> that the Persons who were <HI>ap∣pointed</HI>
to <HI>View</HI> that <HI>River,</HI> should
<HI>every Week</HI> make <HI>Oath</HI> of its <HI>State,</HI>
and the <HI>Abuses</HI> done to it, perhaps it
may appear necessary, both to the Com∣missioners
of the <HI>Admiralty</HI> and the <HI>Lord
Mayor,</HI> to apply to the <HI>Parliament</HI> that a
<HI>New</HI> Form of <HI>Oaths</HI> may be enjoyn'd to
all Persons ministerially concern'd in the
Care of the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Thames,</HI> and the
<PB N="cxx" REF="69"/>
which kind of <HI>Oaths</HI> may likewise be en∣joyn'd
to Persons employ'd in the Conser∣vacy
of the Royal Rivers in the Coun∣trey.
This is here mention'd, because 'tis
conceiv'd, that a <HI>New Oath</HI> cannot be
imposed but by Authority of Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>I suppose the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI>'s Deputy
<HI>Water-Bailiff</HI> was never upon his Oath
not to <HI>connive</HI> at Encroachments on the
River: But the very <HI>common Fame</HI> a∣bout
the <HI>Water-Bailiff</HI>'s <HI>Tenants,</HI> may
make either a <HI>promissory</HI> Oath to that
effect necessary in the beginning of every
<HI>Mayor</HI>'s Year, or at the end of it an
<HI>assertory</HI> one that he hath not done
it.</P>
<P>I know a Gentleman, who charging a
late <HI>Water-Bailiff</HI> with taking of <HI>Mo∣ney</HI>
from <HI>Encroachers,</HI> was answer'd,
<HI>That he did no such thing, but would
not deny but that some of his fol∣lowers
might do so.</HI> Good God! what
unsafe anchoring do all our great Trusts
in this World find, while we trust our
<HI>Bodies</HI> to Apothecaries Boyes, our <HI>E∣states</HI>
to Lawyers Clarks or the Appren∣tices
of Scriveners, our <HI>Souls</HI> to poor Cu∣rates,
<PB N="cxxi" REF="69"/>
and our principal <HI>Royal</HI> River to
a Water-baily's <HI>Followers!</HI></P>
<P>When I consider that mighty spirit of
Industry that appear'd in <HI>France</HI> with
success, for joyning the <HI>two</HI> Seas, a
work that heretofore abash'd the <HI>Roman</HI>
Empire, and was attempted and given
over in foregoing Reigns, and yet not∣withstanding
the remoteness of the <HI>two
Seas,</HI> the Mountains, the <HI>Boggy-Lands,</HI>
the scarcity of Water in a Countrey
where there was hardly enough to sup∣ply
the Gardens, and many other diffi∣culties,
that it was in a few Years
brought to its perfection, while the
Crown there was in War against the
most powerful States of <HI>Europe</HI> united
together, I shall wonder much if we
have not a stock of Brains and In∣dustry
enough going to keep our River
of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>What great Pains and Charge the
work of meliorating that River cost
our Ancestors, the <HI>Chronicles</HI> tell us,
and how useful for the preservations of
it the pains taken in a late Conjuncture,
(when the Cities <HI>Charter</HI> was in its
low estate) by the former Commissioners
<PB N="cxxii" REF="70"/>
of the Admiralty, proved, is obvious;
and therefore the Wisdom of our An∣cestors
in <HI>Complicating</HI> the <HI>Office</HI> of the
Lord <HI>Admiral</HI> with the Lord <HI>Mayors</HI> in
its <HI>Conservacy,</HI> was very profound;
for the <HI>Admiral's</HI> Office being during plea∣sure,
we are sure that whoever have that
Office, are the <HI>actual</HI> Favourites of the
Government; and by being so, they have
with the better success signalized their di∣ligence
in the preserving that River.</P>
<P>It must here in Iustice be acknowledg∣ed,
that the late King <HI>James,</HI> while the
Admiralty was in his Hands, was not
by all the Cares and Business incumbent
on the Crown, diverted from the <HI>Conser∣vacy</HI>
of the River. And if all the par∣ticulars
of the vast pains taken by Mr.
<HI>Pepys</HI> therein, while he was <HI>Secretary</HI>
of the Admiralty, were enumerated, they
would fill a much larger <HI>Volume</HI> than
what I here send your Lordship. His
concerning himself so much and so often
in the behalf of <HI>Petitioning</HI> Seamen who
conceiv'd themselves injured by the <HI>Agents</HI>
of Patentees requiring Money of them
for their Ships lying on the Shoar, and
his <HI>Frank</HI> interceding with the <HI>King</HI>
<PB N="cxxiii" REF="70"/>
as <HI>Admiral</HI> for them, and effecting their
being <HI>speedily</HI> righted, and that with∣out
any Fee of Office expected or paid,
are things fresh in the Memories of
those who live by the <HI>Thames</HI>-side below
Bridge.</P>
<P>And the truth is, to a Person so know∣ing
in the <HI>Office</HI> of the <HI>Admiral,</HI> it
must needs be known, that <HI>Seamen</HI> being
more than other Subjects compell'd to serve
the <HI>Crown</HI> in times of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI>
and at the Crowns own <HI>Rates</HI> both at
<HI>home</HI> and <HI>abroad,</HI> are entituled to a
more <HI>tender</HI> Protection from the Crown
than <HI>other</HI> Subjects are: And that the
<HI>Seamen</HI> being call'd to such <HI>Service</HI> by
the <HI>Admiral</HI>'s Warrant, will in the Case
of any general pressure happening to them
wherein the King's Name is used, <HI>ex∣pect</HI>
that the <HI>Admiral</HI> shall <HI>apply</HI> to the
<HI>Crown</HI> in their behalf, as knowing that
no <HI>Admiral</HI> ever <HI>refused</HI> or <HI>delay'd</HI> in
such Case to take the trouble of patroni∣zing
them.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I have now almost done
troubling you for the present; and yet
according to a <HI>Jewish</HI> Proverb, that <HI>Mo∣lestus
<PB N="cxxiv" REF="71"/>
ubi se molestum agnoscit, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
est molestus,</HI> shall hope I have not done
it at all. But I shall chiefly fortifie my
hopes of my not having so done, by the
Consideration of its being no <HI>trouble</HI> to
you, but an <HI>Obligation</HI> for any One to
furnish your great thoughts with any use∣ful
<HI>Materials</HI> for the promoting the ser∣vice
of your <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Countrey,</HI> in
such a <HI>critical</HI> season as this, that calls
so loud for that <HI>Old</HI> heathenish Virtue
of the <HI>Pietas in Patriam</HI> to <HI>awaken</HI> it self
among <HI>English</HI> Christians.</P>
<P>We may well believe our <HI>Chronicles,</HI>
that tell us of a <HI>Porter</HI> who <HI>slept</HI> fourteen
dayes and nights together, when we have
seen so great a part of a whole Nation asleep
four or five Years, and much longer.</P>
<P>The last Reign save one was a time
wherein men made pleasure their business,
and when the Nation suffer'd more by
<HI>Lethargy</HI> than the <HI>Plague.</HI> But as
Nature doth now call upon us to make
<HI>Business</HI> our <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and to build
Work-houses as well as Play-houses, so
it may be supposed that our World is as
weary of <HI>sleeping</HI> as ever it was of
<HI>waking,</HI> and that Reasons for Mens
<PB N="cxxv" REF="71"/>
being <HI>publick spirited</HI> and nobly active
in all the publick Spheres in Magistra∣cy
to which they are call'd, may be
patiently heard, and that it may seem
a reasonable Request, since we see in
things natural, some inanimate things
to serve the Nature of the <HI>Universe</HI>
do sometimes forgo and quit their <HI>par∣ticular</HI>
Nature (and as for example,
water to prevent a Vacuum which Na∣ture
abhorrs, doth ascend,) that <HI>Magi∣strates</HI>
would go on in their own <HI>natural</HI>
Course to what lyes in the plain way of
their Duty, and what is incumbent on
them by moral Obligations. <HI>Faxit:</HI> And
that he may neither be a shame to, nor
ashamed of his Countrey, who hath the
Honour of being</P>

Complaints, upon which the

they have instanced in, were

Wood (the only securi∣ty
before this of Lead,
for sheathing Ships a∣gainst

circumstances greatly de∣trimental
<PB REF="77"/>
to his Majesty,
with respect both to his
Ships and to his Service,
<HI>p.</HI> 36.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the only Expedient
besides this of Lead, for
obviating those Evils in
Wood-sheathing, has hi∣therto

his Majesty's Ships to the
Worm unsheathed, <HI>p.</HI> 39.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the only third Me∣thod
yet extant of serv∣ing
his Majesty herein,
is this of Lead sheathing;

Evils in the former two,

relating to the Iron-work,

For executing the Office of

<HEAD>The humble Reply of Sir Philip How∣ard,
Sir Francis Watson, K<SUP>ts</SUP>.
and Comp. interested in the Ma∣nufacture
and Invention of Milled-Lead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octob. 28. 1682.</NOTE>
to the late Report to your
Lordships from the Officers of the
Navy, touching the Method of
Lead-sheathing, used upon his Ma∣jesties
Ships: Wherein they shew to
your Lordships,</HEAD>
<P>THat from every Ship of his Majesties
that has been so sheathed, they have
had complaints of the extraordina∣ry
<HI>Eating</HI> and <HI>Corroding</HI> of their
<HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> and <HI>Bolts,</HI> beyond whatever was
found upon any Ship not so sheathed, and an∣nexed
a Transcript of several Complaints by
them received from several Commanders and o∣thers
to that effect: And that therefore upon due
<PB N="2" REF="82"/>
sideration had thereof, and of the many Expe∣riences
had of the great damages arising from
this sort of Sheathing; They give it as their
Opinion, that it will not be for his Maje∣sties
Service, that the same be longer used
upon his Ships: but that the Ships so Sheath∣ed,
may have their sheathing stripped off, and
new Iron-work supplied where defective, as well
to prevent any further damage from the lon∣ger
Continuance of the said Sheahing upon
them, as that they may be in a condition of ser∣vice
whenever on a sudden occasion, the same
may be called for.</P>
<P><HI>To which Report, and the Matters
of Complaint wheron the same is
grounded, importing a vehement sug∣gestion
of ruine likely to attend the
Ships and Service of his Majesty,
in Case this Method of Lead-sheath∣ing
should be continued: The said
Sir Ph. Howard and Comp<SUP>a</SUP>. do
make this plain Return, viz.</HI></P>
<P>THat as their first interesting themselves in
this undertaking, was wholly founded
upon the hopes they had of being enabled to
contribute somewhat thereby to the Service
of the Royal Navy, and those hopes confirm∣ed
by as ample Instances of Publick approba∣tion
as were ever given to any precedent In∣vention;
so do they still give his Majesties
<PB N="3" REF="82"/>
Service the same entire preference to all con∣siderations
of private advantage that either
has or can arise to them from the same un∣dertaking;
And therefore are not only con∣tented,
but desirous, that in case your Lord∣ships
shall (after perusal of this Paper) hold
the reasonableness of the said Officers Advice,
for suppressing the further use of Lead-Sheath∣ing,
sufficiently demonstrated by what they
have offered as the grounds thereof in that col∣lection
of Complaints: No Considerations re∣lating
to the Interest or Right of this Com∣pany,
may stand in the way of whatever his
Majesty and your Lordships shall think most
for his Service to determine concerning it.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A Deduction of the whole Matter re∣lating
to the Lead-sheathing of his
Majesty's Ships, with what this Com∣pany
do in their Duty hold themselves
bound on this Occasion to offer of their
own Reflections and Sentiments thereon.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in the Year 1670. when this Com∣pany
becoming Masters of this Invention
of <HI>Milled-Lead,</HI> they soon met with Encourage∣ment,
not only from sundry Officers and Buil∣ders
of the Navy, but from his Majesty him∣self,
and his Royal Highness then Lord High
Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> to an immediate expo∣sing
the same to practice.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="83"/>But such was their backwardness to pre∣sume
upon falling into the exercise of an In∣vention,
(though never so self-convinced of
its Efficacy and Safety) whose first Experi∣ments,
and future use, were principally to be
made upon a Subject of so high consideration,
as that of the Royal Navy of <HI>England,</HI> with∣out
passing the most strict and solemn proba∣tion
a matter of that kind could, and ought
to have in a Government like this subsisting
by <HI>Navigation,</HI> namely, That of his Majesty's
in <HI>Parliament,</HI> that they in the same Year
brought this their <HI>Invention</HI> into the Parlia∣ment
then sitting: Where, after all the seve∣rities
of Scrutiny capable of being exercised
in each of the <HI>Houses</HI> successively, and publick
Conferences had with all Persons qualified
for giving Advice therein, and those attend∣ed
not only with the prejudice all new Pro∣positions
ordinarily meet with, but from op∣position
of the Persons interested in the pre∣servation
of the old ones, (whereof more here∣after,)
it not only received full Approbation
by being passed then into an <HI>Act,</HI> but had the
same done in Terms the most expressive of
the Conviction and Satisfaction wherewith
his <HI>Majesty</HI> and <HI>Parliament</HI> passed the said Act
with regard both to the <HI>Invention</HI> and <HI>Inven∣tors;</HI>
as by part thereof following appears,

<HEAD>An Act for granting unto Sir Phi∣lip
Howard, Knight, and Francis

for the benefit of Shipping.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas it appears upon Examina∣tion
that Sir <HI>Philip Howard,</HI>
Knight, and <HI>Francis Watson,</HI> Esquire, by
their great Charge and Industry have
found out a New Manufacture, Art, or
Invention to preserve Ships, and other
Uessels under Water, with certain Com∣modities
chiefly of the growth of his Ma∣jesties
Dominons, which is much cheap∣er,
and more smooth, and dureable than
any way by Deals for Sheathing, or
Pitch, Tarr, Rozin, Brimstone, or any
Graving hitherto used: Now for the En∣couragement
of Ingenuity and Industry
in the like cases; and to the intent that
the said Sir <HI>Philip Howard,</HI> and <HI>Francis
Watson,</HI> may be protected in the use of the
said Manufacture, Art, or Invention,
and have encouragement to make the same
publick, for the benefit of his Majesties

<P>This being done, and the said Company
not only invited, but by his Majesty com∣manded
to apply themselves forthwith to the
putting in use this Invention upon some of his
own Ships, they by his Order, and on Terms
<PB N="6" REF="84"/>
adjusted with the Officers of the Navy, pro∣ceeded
to the making the first Experiment
thereof at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> upon the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> in the

<P>But your Lordships may be pleased here to
be informed, That (however upon the stamp
given it by Parliament) this Company were
so let in by the Officers of the Navy to the
exercise of their said Invention; yet was it
not without fresh assaults from some who
were interested in the benefit arising from the
labour, and the Materials employed in the
bringing on, and stripping off the <HI>Wood-sheath∣ing,</HI>
in whose place this was to succeed: And
by their Arts and Industry, were Sir <HI>Philip
Howard,</HI> and <HI>Company</HI> in a restless manner ur∣ged
to give Answers (all over again) to the Obje∣ctions

<P>AFter our hearty commendations, in pursuance

</LETTER>
<P>Notwithstanding which, such was the Re∣luctancy
(or Caution) wherewith the Officers
of the Navy did yet think fit to proceed in the
adventuring to give any Encouragement to this
Invention, That not adjudging a three Years
proof available in this Case, they thought
expedient to take two Years more, and the
benefit of what Observations they could either
make or collect from the several <HI>Lead-sheathed</HI>
Ships employed on Southern Service within
that time, the better to enable themselves
without mistake to determine concerning the
execution of his Majesties said Order; which
indeed (after the five Years end) they did
comply with, by entering into a solemn Con∣tract
with Sir <HI>Philip Howard,</HI> and <HI>Company,</HI>
for the future sheathing his Majesties Ships
with Lead, and this with such alacrity and
fulness of seeming Conviction concerning it's
advantageousness to the King, that (besides
their voluntary exchanging <HI>many and good proofs,</HI>
&amp;c. the terms of his Majesties said Order, in∣to
<HI>sufficient proof and Experience of the Goodness
and Usefulness of the Invention of Milled-Lead,
and Nails for the Sheathing and preserving Ships
<PB N="9" REF="85"/>
against the Worm</HI>) they would not permit the
said Company to reserve to themselves any
part, but would secure to the King in the
said Contract a Title to the whole term then
remaining of the time for which they were
by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> invested in the sole
benefit of their Invention, and whereof there
was then twenty years yet to come. And
thus stood this Matter at the close of the Year
1675. when it might reasonably have been
thought, that it had come to such, and so de∣liberate
a settlement, as no new scruples could
have been raised about it, on the part of the
Navy Officers, or any occasion of fresh disqui∣et
created to this Company.</P>
<P>But so it was ordered, or at lest fell out,
that no sooner were all things thus seemingly
satisfied, and established at home, but a new
Cry, and of a quite new kind, breaks out
from abroad, of a quality discovered in our
Lead-sheathing, tending (if not timely prevent∣ed)
to the utter Destruction of his Majesties
Ships, namely, That of the <HI>Eating</HI> into, and
wasting their <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> and <HI>Bolts</HI> under
water, to such a degree, and in so short a
space of time, as had never been observed up∣on
any unsheathed or Wood-sheathed Ships.</P>
<P>Nor lay this long unseconded by concurrent
Advices from <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> in reference to some
of them that were sheathed with Lead, and
then in that Harbour, and the Accompts there∣of
circumstanced with such particularities as
seemed to obtain Credit not only with the
Navy Officers, but his Majesty, and the Lords
of the Admiralty, and even this Company too,
<PB N="10" REF="86"/>
at least so far, as to excite in all a desire of En∣quiry
into the true grounds of it.</P>
<P>In order to which (leaving it to the Navy
Officers to give your Lordships an Accompt
of theirs, as we shall (by and by) of our own
Endeavours therein) it pleased his Malesty,
and my Lords of the Admiralty, not only by
several Orders to recommend to the said Of∣ficers
the general matter of this Enquiry, but
(upon a suggestion made to them by this Com∣pany,
of their apprehending this evil to arise
from some <HI>defectiveness</HI> in the Iron-work it
self, with a tender of their service, towards
finding out the full truth thereof) to direct
the Officers of the Navy by no less than four
several <HI>Orders</HI> within the Months of <HI>April</HI> and
<HI>May,</HI> 1678. to receive from the said Compa∣ny
what <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> should be so provided
by them, and employ no other upon any Ships
to be thenceforward <HI>sheathed</HI> with <HI>Lead,</HI> than
what were so provided, since which (being
full four Years and an half) this Company has
nevertheless been so far from having any oppor∣tunities
given them by the said Officers of doing
his Majesty the service by these Orders expected,
That the first and only sight or knowledge we had
of what progress they in all that time made to∣wards
the decision of this matter, is what your
Lordships were pleased so lately to surprize us
with in this their Report; wherein the whole
supposed Consumption of the Iron-work of his
Majesties Ships, and all the ruinous Conse∣quences
apprehended therefrom to the Navy,
are expresly laid on Lead-sheathing, and that
only; and grounded this their sentence upon
<PB N="11" REF="86"/>
no other Inducements (for ought appears) than
the particulars of Complaint accompanying
the said Report: The Truth, Consistences, and
Conclusiveness of which Complaints for pro∣ving
the chargeableness of this evil on Lead-sheathing,
your Lordships will (we doubt not)
see through, upon a bare review of the said
Complaints, joyned with this their Reasoning
therefrom, as follows.</P>
<P>1. From Sir <HI>Iohn Norbrough</HI>'s saying, That in
<HI>Iuly</HI> 1678, the <HI>Plymouth</HI>'s Rudder-Irons began
to be much eaten, doubting his being forced
thereby to send her home that Winter, from
the incapacity he was in, of getting her re∣cruited
abroad, and Sir <HI>R. B</HI>'s adding in
<HI>September</HI> 1682. that had she not been sup∣plyed
with new Rudder-Irons before her com∣ing
out of the <HI>Streights,</HI> she had been in the
same ill condition with another Ship he had
then newly spoken of; whereas we are under no
doubts of Sir <HI>I. Narbrough</HI>'s owning to your
Lordships what he has lately done to some of
us, that she had no supply of fresh Rudder-Irons
abroad, but came home with her old
ones, and those (it seems) in so good case,
that Sir <HI>R. B.</HI> could not distinguish them from
Irons of a new supply.</P>
<P>2. From Sir <HI>R. B</HI>'s descripition of the ill
condition of the <HI>Harwich</HI>'s Iron-works discover∣ed
at her cleaning in 1682. in their being eat∣en
away to nothing, so as to make it matter of
wonder that she sunk not in the Sea; whereas
(besides her said Iron-works having been fast∣ened
<PB N="12" REF="87"/>
in her five Years and an half, without any
Complaint heard of concerning them all her
Voyage, or at her coming home in <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1679.
Sir <HI>R. B.</HI> must be thought subject to some mis∣take;
or both he, and the Surveyor of the Na∣vy
made accountable for a breach (much less
easily answered for) both of the general Laws
of the said Navy, and their particular Instru∣ction
therein, by suffering a Ship of her Va∣lue,
and coming home in so sinking a conditi∣on,
to lye afterwards above three Years in Har∣bour
unsearched.</P>
<P>3. From Sir <HI>Iohn Kempthornes</HI> Complaint in
<HI>Iune</HI> 1677. of the <HI>Dreadnought</HI>'s Rudder-Irons
being within a Year and an half (and that in
Harbour) so eaten, as not to be fit for her being
adventured to Sea again with them, for more
than a small tripp; and that followed by
a later, from Sir <HI>R. B.</HI> in <HI>October</HI> 1682.
wherein (after her having been abroad) he
makes the Condition of her Iron-works so mi∣serable,
as to be under the same wonder he
was before, that she also had not sunk at Sea;
whereas it appears even from their own <HI>calcu∣lations,</HI>
that her first set of Rudder-Irons last∣ed
her four Years and an half, (which were
it a common standand for their duration, and
then to be renewed, would yet leave <HI>Lead-sheathing</HI>
greatly cheaper than that of <HI>Wood,</HI>)
and her second (for ought that appears of any
supplies) six Years and three quarters.</P>
<P>4. From a <HI>Certificate</HI> of the <HI>Officers</HI> in <HI>Ports∣mouth-Yard,</HI>
in <HI>October</HI> 1677. declaring the Con∣dition
<PB N="13" REF="87"/>
of the <HI>Lyon</HI>'s <HI>Iron-works</HI> under water, to
be such as they never saw in any Ship they
ever had to do with, not <HI>sheathed</HI> with <HI>Lead,</HI>
though droven twice as long: Whereas that
<HI>Certificate it self</HI> does not only expresly confess
her <HI>Bolts</HI> having been all in her five Years; but
will here furnish your Lordships with one In∣stance
(besides the many you may hereafter
meet with) of what this Company is owing
for, to the sincerity as well as Thoughtfulness
of its Accusers, if your Lordships shall please
to have their last Assertion examined by the
Books of the Navy Officers, with whom it
carries so much weight, this Company being
well assured, that instead of no Ship, not
sheathed with Lead, being ever found perish∣ed
in their Iron-work under water in twice
five years, variety of instances will be met
with, within much a shorter time.</P>
<P>5. From Sir <HI>Iohn Narbrough</HI>'s saying in <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI>
1676. that he had found the condition
of the <HI>Henrietta</HI>'s Iron-works no other than
that of the forementioned <HI>Harwich:</HI> whereas
your Lordships may be pleased (here) to take
notice, that the Lords your Predecessors in the
<HI>Admiralty</HI> did by their Order of the 9<HI>th</HI> of
<HI>April</HI> 1678. (upon some Complaints touching
the Iron-works of this Ship,) recommend to
the Officers of the Navy, the making a strict
enquiry into the general and natural Reasons
of this great Evil, directing them twice in the
same order to the particular case of this Ship:
For execution whereof the said Officers con∣tented
themselves, with answering the Lords
<PB N="14" REF="88"/>
not with any effects of their own Inquisitions,
but with a bare Transcript only of Sir <HI>R. B</HI>'s
Conceptions thereon from <HI>Chatham;</HI> when
(had they so thought good) they could as well
have given their Lorships something of their
own, by communicating to them the Result of
an <HI>Occular</HI> Survey by them had in their Pub∣lick
Office (this Company being present) of
the Rudder-Irons themselves, sent from <HI>Chat∣ham</HI>
for that purpose; where (upon the out∣ward
coat of the said Irons being eaten off
with Rust) the inside of their <HI>Pintells,</HI> (as ne∣ver
having had their <HI>due welding</HI>) discovered
themselves in three several arms or branches,
like the stalks of so many Tobacco-pipes, not
only to the removing the wonder of this Ships
condition, but confirming the suggestion this
Company had before made to his Majesty and
the Lords touching the <HI>Smiths neglects,</HI> and
contributing not a little towards the making
a right Judgment in the Matters in question,
of which more in its due place.</P>
<P>6. From Sir <HI>R. B</HI>'s observing in <HI>September</HI>
1682. the eating off of two of the lower <HI>Pin∣tells</HI>
and <HI>Gudgeons</HI> wholly, and a third in part
of the <HI>Rose,</HI> which will not (as this Company
conceives) be thought very extraordinary when
it shall be understood that this is the first and
only Complaint heard of her, not only after
two Voyages to Sea, and one of them three
years long, and her having lain now three
years more in Salt water in Harbour; but af∣ter
her having worn those Irons eight years,
and the Complaint it self (when all is done)
<PB N="15" REF="88"/>
amounting only to three Pintells and Gudge∣ons,
without any thing objected to the rest
of her Iron-works.</P>
<P>7. From Sir <HI>Iohn Narbrough</HI>'s Information
in <HI>Iuly</HI> 1678. touching some defectiveness then
discovered in the <HI>Iames</HI> and <HI>Charles Gallies,</HI>
which he fears would force him to send them
home that Winter, as not being repairable in
the <HI>Streights:</HI> Whereas the <HI>Iames</HI> being sheath∣ed,
and sent forth in <HI>October</HI> 1676. continued
there three years, when making a Tripp for
<HI>England,</HI> she within two months after return∣ed
thither, and has there remained to this day
(being in all six years) without ought said by
the <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>Navy,</HI> of her having any
<HI>Recruits</HI> of her <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> in all that time
either at home or abroad.</P>
<P>And for the <HI>Charles,</HI> which accompanyed
the <HI>Iames</HI> to Sea in <HI>October</HI> 1676, (instead of
being driven home, as Sir <HI>Iohn Narbrough</HI> ap∣prehended
in 1678.) she continued there till
about <HI>August</HI> 1680. (being four years) and
has now remained at home above two years
more, (in all six years) without any such re∣pairs
alledged to have been given her either
in the <HI>Streights</HI> or here.</P>
<P>8. Lastly, From these particulars of eight
Ships, thus circumstanced, the Officers of the
Navy have held it reasonable to assert to your
Lordships their having received Complaints of
the extraordinary Corrosion of the Iron-works
of every of his Majesties Ships sheathed with
Lead: Whereas these make but eight of twen∣ty
<PB N="16" REF="89"/>
so sheathed, without any thing either of∣fered
now, or heretofore appearing to this
Company in exception to the other twelve,
<HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Mary,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Defiance,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Woolwich,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Bristol,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hampshire,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Foresight,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Phoenix,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Assistance,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Kingsfisher,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hunter,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Vulture,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Norwich.</ITEM>
</LIST>
but on the contrary many Instances might
be drawn from them, in advantage to the
Credit of Lead-sheathing, of much more force
(were that the business of this Paper) than
any thing of what has been before offered to
its diminution:</P>
<P>But this Company humbly referrs your
Lordships for that to the Navy Officers, con∣tenting
themselves with an Appeal only to
the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> and <HI>Norwich,</HI> the first and last of
all the twenty: The former of which coming
home after two Voyages, and three years
spent therein, happened (as has been already
mentioned) to <HI>Carreene</HI> at <HI>Sheerness,</HI> where his
Majesty receiving full satisfaction in her ha∣ving
answered all that was aimed at in this
sheathing, she from thence proceeded to <HI>Gui∣ny,</HI>
and after return in 1674. was sent to <HI>Ia∣maica,</HI>
(Voyages all calculated for the proving
her against the Worm,) and coming back, was
in 1677. stripp'd of her sheathing, and then
sent abroad unsheathed, without having one
<PB N="17" REF="89"/>
<HI>Bolt</HI> under water shifted from her being so
sheathed to that day, being seven years.</P>
<P>And for the <HI>Norwich,</HI> we are well inform∣ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is a Mistake, for she was neglected to be sheathed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, thô Order'd.</NOTE>
that not one word of Advice, much less
of Complaint has ever been received either
from her Commanders, or any other hand, of
the least defect discovered in any of her Iron-work
under water during the whole four
years time of her service in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
from her first sheathing to the day of her
Miscarriage.</P>
<P>Nor does this Company (after having thus
opened the matters of Fact reported in these
Complaints) conceive it will appear to your
Lordships less allowable for them in this place,
to make one Remark upon what the Officers
of the Navy have offered in the same Paper of
suggestions Philosophical, in support of their
present Sentence against Lead-sheathing, which
is, that they were suggestions, which seem ra∣ther
calculated for the giving countenance to
an Opinion already espoused, than for the
raising an Opinion upon that, is yet in seeking;
One being that of Sir <HI>Iohn Kempthornes,</HI> who
with some of his Officers lighting upon a
piece of <HI>Milled-Lead,</HI> (which seemed to them
to have taken some wet) they conceived it
presently to look of a <HI>Cancarous</HI> and <HI>Corroding</HI>
substance, and venomous to Iron, (qualities
not usuaily judged of by the Eye) promising
the sending up a Sample of it to the Officers
of the Navy for their Inspection; which if
they did, the said Officers would not have
needed any other Evidence against Lead-sheath∣ing,
than their Experiments upon this one piece,
<PB N="18" REF="90"/>
had Sir <HI>Iohn Kempthornes</HI> conceptions of it,
met with any Confirmation therefrom; where∣in
your Lordships will easily receive full satis∣faction
from the said Officers.</P>
<P>Another, That of Sir <HI>R. B</HI>'s, who in
his Declaration upon this matter chargeth
this <HI>Eating</HI> of the <HI>Lead</HI>-to the <HI>mixture it is
prepared with for the making it run thin, by which
it is rendred of a more blew colour than Lead or∣dinarily
is, and with Salt-water creates a kind
of Coperas that consumes the Iron-works under wa∣ter;</HI>
whereas whoever is conversant in the me∣thod
of this Company in the <HI>manufacturing</HI>
part of their <HI>Invention,</HI> know that the only
<HI>mystery</HI> thereof lies in the application of <HI>Lead</HI>
to <HI>Rollers,</HI> by which it is reduced without any
<HI>inequalities</HI> to what degree of thickness or
thinness is demanded, without the least other
<HI>Preparation</HI> or <HI>Mixture</HI> exercised upon the <HI>Me∣tal</HI>
it self, but is pressed, and brought upon
the Ships sides as <HI>simple,</HI> and <HI>unaltered</HI> as ever
it flowed from the Pig.</P>
<P><HI>The last, that of Sir</HI> Iohn Narbrough<HI>'s Opi∣nion
of its being</HI> the Copper covering the Rud∣der-Irons,
and the Copper nailes the sheathing is
fastened with, that destroys the Iron-work: <HI>where∣to
we hold it unnecessary here to return any
thing in opposition more, than what the said
Officers at the same time present you with of
a quite contrary Principle, though in main∣tenance
of the same Position, from Sir</HI> R.
B. <HI>who expresly declares his having found
by experience,</HI> That it is not the Irons covered
with Copper, and nailed even with Iron Nails,
that suffer from the Rust; but only those which
<PB N="19" REF="90"/>
the Lead together with the Salt water drains
and falls upon.</P>
<P>And this, My Lords, having been said in
Reference to all that the Navy Officers have
in their <HI>Report</HI> thought fit to give for the
grounds of this their so positive Determinati∣on
against <HI>Lead-sheathing:</HI> And wherein this
Company have only this to ask, that they may
not from ought they have already, or may
yet further say upon this occasion, be misun∣derstood
by your Lordships, as if they were
under any disbelief themselves, or aimed at
the getting any in others, touching the Truth
of Fact now discoursed upon, there being
none more sensible than themselves, both of
the Reality of this wast of Iron-work by <HI>Rust,</HI>
and the ill importance of it, in its consequen∣ces;
They now proceed to the giving your
Lordships the best assistance they can towards
the discovery of what is the true sourse of
this Evil, and that in the plainness of this
following Method, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. By submitting to your Lordships their
Opinion, and its Reasons, That the
Sheathing of Ships with Lead, neither is,
nor can (as such) be the true <HI>Cause</HI> of
this <HI>decay</HI> of <HI>Iron-work.</HI></P>
<P>2. By doing the like in reference to the
<HI>Evils</HI> (for they are more than one) where∣to
this matter under enquiry ought right∣fully
<HI>to be imputed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="91"/>3. By conducting your Lordships to that,
which they take to be the only, certain,
speedy, and effectual <HI>Expedient</HI> of arri∣ving
at the <HI>Truth</HI> in this matter.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> For the <HI>First,</HI> Against the charging this Mis∣chief
upon sheathing with <HI>Lead,</HI> be pleased to
receive the Measures of this Companies judging
therein, in the following Considerations.</P>
<P>(1.) That without taking upon us to Dis∣course
as Philosophers of the different Struc∣tures,
Consistences, Sweetnesses and Acidities of
<HI>Bodies,</HI> and other Difficulties wherewith they
have been frequently entertained, in their En∣quiries
on this Subject, They have made it
their Endeavours to gather the best Informa∣tion
they can, by resorting to that purpose,
to Persons of most allowed Name in Natu∣ral
<HI>Phylosophy</HI> and <HI>Chymistry,</HI> without being
able hitherto to meet with one that will ad∣mit
any thing to lye within the whole natur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of Lead, that either singly, or from any alte∣ration
that can be begotten by its meeting with
<HI>Salt-water,</HI> can contribute ought to the <HI>decay</HI>
of <HI>Iron</HI> by <HI>Corrosion,</HI> as being a Mettal so void
of any disposition that way, as to subdue that
very quality of <HI>corroding</HI> in other Bodies the
most acid and sour, of which, as we have had
the honour more than once of hearing his <HI>Majesty</HI>
himself discourse in Confirmation, so do we rea∣dily
and humbly referr your Lordships not on∣ly
to the same Royal Advice, but to the ho∣nourable
and learned Gentleman, and most
eminently so, for his researches into those ab∣struser
<PB N="21" REF="91"/>
parts of <HI>Natural</HI> Knowledge, Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI>
or whoever you shall please to consult with
herein, taking with you the like confideration
about the <HI>Nails,</HI> to which some (as has been
already shewn) seem more inclinable to im∣pute
this Evil, than to the Lead, our daily
experience shewing them at seven years end,
as free from <HI>Rust,</HI> as at their first driving, and
being so <HI>Rust-proof</HI> in themselves, will not any
more be admitted with those we have dis∣coursed
with, as capable of infecting with Rust
any other adjacent, or even continguous Metal.</P>
<P>(2.) That from beyond the Memory of Man,
and therefore before the being of this Inventi∣on,
(at least within these Dominions) univer∣sal
Practice both in his Majesties <HI>Yards,</HI> and
Merchants Buildings, has and does at this day
make <HI>Lead</HI> the common security of <HI>Iron-work</HI>
against <HI>Rust,</HI> not only by covering therewith
(upon all Ships unsheathed, and designed on
long Voyages) the <HI>Iron-work</HI> about the <HI>Rudder,</HI>
but by <HI>capping</HI> the <HI>heads</HI> of their <HI>Bolts</HI> under
water with pieces of <HI>Lead</HI> sized to, and nailed
over the said Bolts.</P>
<P>Nor is this all, for at this day whatever <HI>Mer∣chant-Man,</HI>
or <HI>Man</HI> of <HI>War</HI> is appointed for a
Voyage where the <HI>Worm</HI> eats, the back of her
<HI>Stern-post,</HI> and <HI>Beard</HI> of her <HI>Rudder,</HI> are <HI>sheath∣ed</HI>
with <HI>Copper</HI> or <HI>Lead,</HI> and this even where
the Ships also are sheathed with <HI>Wood,</HI> the
<HI>East-India</HI> Company it self, (upon whom we
may best depend for cautions, wherever pre∣servation
of Ships is in question) not omitting in
that very case, to <HI>sheath</HI> their <HI>Rudders</HI> with <HI>Lead</HI>
or <HI>Copper.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="92"/>Which Practice could certainly never have
prevailed with our Fathers, and been followed
with so continued a consent to this Day by us,
if the vicinity of either of these Metals assisted
(as is by some imagined) by Salt-water, had
been ever found of so pernicious and certain
Effect upon the very Matter they are imployed
to secure.</P>
<P>(3.) Nor does what is thus approved of in
the general, and universal Practice of <HI>England,</HI>
want its confirmation, by the like of several
Forreign Nations, to wit, the <HI>Dutch, Portu∣guese</HI>
and <HI>Spaniard;</HI> the first of which are
equally observant with us, in the <HI>sheathing</HI> their
<HI>Rudder Irons,</HI> and the <HI>Back</HI> of their <HI>Posts</HI> with
<HI>Lead</HI> or <HI>Copper</HI> upon all Ships bound in the
way of the <HI>Worm;</HI> and for the two latter, not
only the <HI>Rudders</HI> but the whole <HI>Bodies</HI> of their
Ships under Water, even of their <HI>Gallions</HI> them∣selves,
have of long time been, and are well
known at this Day to be entirely <HI>sheathed with
Lead;</HI> which concurrence of these two latter
<HI>Nations,</HI> seems in this Cause so much more
considerable than that of any other, by how
much not only their Voyages are the longest,
their hazards therein from the <HI>Worm</HI> the great∣est,
and <HI>Cargoes</HI> the most valuable of all that
Navigation knows, but for that the <HI>Hulls</HI> of
their Ships abound the most with <HI>Iron-work,</HI> as
having all that in the fastening of our Plank
we perform with <HI>wooden Trunnels,</HI> done by them
with large <HI>Spikes</HI> of <HI>Iron.</HI></P>
<P>(4.) Lastly, Were this Spoil of Iron-work
<PB N="23" REF="92"/>
chargeable with nothing but what is contained
in the <HI>Lead</HI> and <HI>Nails,</HI> these pretended Effects
of theirs would be <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>uniform</HI> in all
Ships alike sheathed; whereas nothing is more
frequent than the Instances of their <HI>Inequality,</HI>
as will enough appear from a bare Observati∣on
of what lies before your Lordships in this
very <HI>Report</HI> of the <HI>Navy-Officers:</HI> Forasmuch as
this <HI>Company</HI> dare put the whole Credit of their
<HI>Cause</HI> upon that one <HI>Issue, viz.</HI> of your Lord∣ships
ever finding an <HI>Equal Consumption of Iron∣work</HI>
under Water, whether upon the same,
or different Ships at any one time, or equal
distances of time; the Account now before you
of the twenty Ships that have passed this Me∣thod
of Sheathing, affording a most ample
Proof of this <HI>Inequality,</HI> by having eight of
them loaden with Complaints, (and every one
of them different from the rest, and at diffe∣rent
times from it self) while we are yet to
be told, whether the other twelve were not,
(as we are sure some of them were) free from
all ground of Complaint.</P>
<P>To our <HI>Second</HI> Undertaking, we conceive <MILESTONE N="2"/>
the <HI>real Causes</HI> of this <HI>Evil,</HI> (that is to say,
so much thereof as is Extraordinary) to be
these three.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>perfunctory Performance</HI> of the <HI>Smiths
Part</HI> in this Affair, by some Deficiency either
in the choice, mixture or temper of his <HI>Metal,</HI>
or failure to give it its due <HI>welding</HI> or work∣ing:
Forasmuch as by this alone can be re∣conciled
the forementioned <HI>Disparities</HI> in the
<PB N="24" REF="93"/>
Duration of <HI>Iron-work;</HI> whence otherwise can
it be, that all other circumstances (whereto
that Disparity can be referred) being the same,
but the matter, one particular Piece of Iron
shall remain undiminished three times as long
as that next to it; and this not only in sheath∣ed
Ships (as in the Case of those before you)
but unsheathed too; as (to give but one In∣stance,
in a Cause where every Ship is ano∣ther)
appears in the <HI>Swiftures</HI> first <HI>Voyage</HI> to
the <HI>Streights</HI> with Sir <HI>Rich. Rooth,</HI> where two
of her <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> were eaten entirely in pie∣ces,
and shifted at her return in <HI>Portsmouth</HI>-Dock;
while at the same time <HI>the rest</HI> (though
<HI>all</HI> put on together several Years before) were
found as firm and unwasted as at their first
fastening.</P>
<P>The consideration and thorough conviction
of which led this <HI>Company</HI> in the <HI>Year</HI> 1678. (when
these Complaints were most active, and the
Lords of the <HI>Admiralty</HI>'s Inquisitions into the
Reasons of it, the more pressing) not only to
Communicate to them, and the Navy-Offi∣cers
their Opinions therein, but at their
own hazards and the Ordinary Price, to be∣come
Undertakers themselves for what fur∣ther
Rudder-Irons should be from thence call∣ed
for (whether at home or abroad) by any
Lead-sheathed Ships: Which Proposition was
not only approved of, but the <HI>Officers</HI> of the
<HI>Navy</HI> (as has been already said) by Orders up∣on
Orders from their Lordships directed, to
see the same instantly put and continued in
practice.</P>
<P>But whence it was that those <HI>Orders</HI> me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="25" REF="93"/>
with no better complyance, or how it came
to pass, that so certain, speedy and chargeless
an <HI>Expedient</HI> of coming by the <HI>Truth</HI> in a matter
of this Importance (and after a provocation too,
so publick and seasonable, as that of the <HI>Henriet∣ta</HI>'s
Rudder-Irons above mentioned) could be so
disregarded as never once to be set on <HI>Tryal,</HI>
your Lordships will be best informed from
them themselves, by whom variety indeed of
Ships were sent to Sea, subsequent to the said
<HI>Orders,</HI> but without any call or notice given
thereof to this <HI>Company,</HI> that his Majesty might
have the proof and benefit of the Service so
much expected from them, and required from
the said Officers both by the King and Lords
on this occasion.</P>
<P>2. The manifest and knowing <HI>Omission</HI> of the
Persons charged in seeing the said sheathing
brought on, to do in this case what the pra∣ctice
of all times, and at this very day, both
in the Kings and Merchants Service, has made a
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anding and necessary piece of care to be ex∣ercised
in the fitting forth of all Ships (sheath∣ed
and unsheathed) bound on Forraign Voya∣ges,
namely, The <HI>parcelling,</HI> or laying with
<HI>Tarr</HI> and <HI>Hair</HI> all the Iron-work under water,
before the sheathing, (in case of the former)
or the forementioned <HI>Capps</HI> (in case of the lat∣ter)
be brought over them.</P>
<P>In which as we are ready to appeal to the
<HI>Surveyor</HI> of the <HI>Navy,</HI> or whoever else is con∣versant
in the Rules and Methods of <HI>Ship-Building,</HI>
for the <HI>Truth</HI> of what is here assert∣ed,
and what is owned in some of the Navy
Officers own Evidences, and particularly in a
<PB N="26" REF="94"/>
Letter of Sir <HI>R. B's;</HI> so do we willing∣ly
referr our selves to the same <HI>Surveyor</HI> for
the Truth of this suggestion of ours, touching
the under Officers omitting the performance
of this their known Duty of laying the Iron-work
under water, at their bringing on the
sheathing of the said Ships.</P>
<P>And if so, and that this Companies preten∣sions
in this Method of sheathing never extend∣ed
further, than to answering the efficacy,
<HI>cheapness,</HI> and other circumstances of advan∣tage
appertaining to the prevention of the
<HI>Worm,</HI> (as the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and their
Contract with the King abundantly prove)
what more Reason is there for their being held
accountable for the Consequences of this <HI>Omis∣sion</HI>
in the Kings Officers, than for that of <HI>start∣ing</HI>
of a <HI>But-head</HI> in a Ships side, that never
had its due fastening? It being no part of their
Undertaking to answer for the <HI>Tightness</HI> of their
sheathing when laid on, and droven with Nails,
further than for its <HI>unpassableness,</HI> not to the
<HI>Water,</HI> but to the <HI>Worm:</HI> And that being al∣lowed,
what can be more <HI>demonstrable,</HI> than
that the <HI>neglect</HI> of ordinary Cautions, must be
attended with the ordinary Evils, those Cau∣tions
were provided against.</P>
<P>Of which, that this of giving the <HI>Iron-work</HI>
of these <HI>Lead-sheathed</HI> Ships, their ordinary
Defence against the <HI>Salt-water</HI> by <HI>Parcelling,</HI>
or laying them with <HI>Tarr</HI> and <HI>Hair</HI> under their
Sheathing, is one, we shall not need to confirm
to your Lordships by more than the single In∣stance
of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> which having had her
<HI>Sheathing</HI> performed by Sir <HI>Ant. Dean</HI> at <HI>Ports∣mouth,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="94"/>
with this <HI>common</HI> right done to her, ap∣pears
not to have had one <HI>Bolt</HI> shifted within
the whole seven Years of carrying the same:
Nor are your Lordships without an eminent proof
of your own, touching the constancy and univer∣sality
of this practice of laying the <HI>Iron-work</HI> of
all sheathed Ships with <HI>Tarr,</HI> and <HI>Hair,</HI> or <HI>Par∣celling,</HI>
and the acknowledged importance of
it, for the securing the said Iron-works from
the Salt-water, (which alone can perform upon
that Metal, all that is here laid upon the Lead)
in the <HI>Happy Retnrn,</HI> sheathed but very few dayes
since with <HI>Wood</HI> at <HI>Woolwich,</HI> where your Buil∣der
will be found in the ordinary course of
his Trade to have laid with Tarr and Hair all
her <HI>Bolt-heads</HI> under water, and fastened <HI>Caps</HI>
of Lead over them, notwithstanding this
Sheathing with Wood was to be brought on
over all.</P>
<P>3. The unaccountable <HI>continuance</HI> of these
Ships for nine, ten, and eleven years together
in their <HI>sheathing,</HI> without their being in all
that time <HI>unstripp'd,</HI> for the necessary <HI>searching</HI>
of their <HI>bottoms,</HI> and timely supplying the <HI>de∣cayes,</HI>
(whether in Iron-work, or otherwise,)
which are of course to be expected within
their proper distances of time; which as it
contradicts all ancient practice both of the
Royal <HI>Navy,</HI> and that of Merchants, especially
in the case of Ships of value, and under care∣ful
Owners, so seems it in this of ours, to be
designed only to render that very <HI>Vertue</HI> for
which (amongst others) <HI>Lead-sheathing</HI> ex∣ceeds
all that ever went before it, namely, its
<HI>durableness,</HI> a Vice of much worse consequence
<PB N="28" REF="95"/>
to the health of a Ship, than all it pretends to
do, and does against the Worm, can make
amends for.</P>
<P>Your Lordships might otherwise be pleased
to inform your selves from the Officers of
the Navy, whence it comes to pass, that after such
Complaints received from abroad, as they have
handed to your Lordships, touching the dread∣ful
<HI>decays</HI> of those Ships Iron-work under water,
they should suffer them, when come home, to
<HI>continue</HI> for two, three, and four years toge∣ther
in <HI>Harbour,</HI> without any thing more done
in all that time, towards their Relief against
the <HI>growing Mischiefs</HI> they are yet daily exposed
to, than a Declaration of <HI>Wonder</HI> at the three
or four years end that they had not before
sunk in the Sea.</P>
<P>Very dissonant is this Method of Proceed∣ing
(my Lords) from the Primitive and pre∣sent
Institution of the <HI>Navy,</HI> that provides so
carefully both in its joynt and separate <HI>Instru∣ctions</HI>
to the Officers thereof, and more par∣ticularly
to the <HI>Surveyor,</HI> not only for the ge∣neral
good Government and Preservation of
his Majesties Ships, but a more strict and <HI>An∣nual</HI>
State to be had of all their respective
Hulls, Masts, and Yards, in order to your
Lordships taking such course for their Ran∣sackings,
Groundings, Dockings, and Repair∣ings,
as by you shall be thought most for his
Majesty's Benefit.</P>
<P>Nor are those <HI>Instructions</HI> a little inforced
upon the said Officers by that <HI>standing Arti∣cle</HI>
in the ordinary Estimate of the Navy,
wherein they Annually make Demands of a
<PB N="29" REF="95"/>
particular summ of Money towards their Exe∣cution
thereof, nor were ever denyed the Al∣lowance
of it by his Majesty, as Duties owned
on each side necessary to be performed.</P>
<P>Which, how far it has been done in refe∣rence
to those unhappy Ships, which of all
others have the least reason to suffer under this
<HI>neglect;</HI> for that by the terms upon which their
Sheathing is performed by this Company for
the benefit of the King, They are well able to
bear the charge of their having it done twice
within the Time, some of them (to the ha∣zard
of their Ruine) are suffered to remain
under its being done but once. We humbly
submit to your Lordships, and (with our full
concurrence to that part of their Report,
wherein they have at length bethought them∣selves
of advising your Lordships to order the
doing of that now, which the Practice of the
Navy, and the acknowledged condition of those
Ships would have expected their having done
<HI>long since</HI>) proceed to the third and last branch
of our Undertaking, and to that humbly
say, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>3. That in order to our leading your Lord∣ships
the more satisfactorily to what we take
to be the only True and Competent method
of rightly determining of the different validi∣ties
of what has been severally offered and
asserted by the Officers of the Navy, and this
Company, in Maintenance of their different
Conceptions touching the Evil now enquired
into: Your Lordships may in the first place
be pleased to take notice, (and therein to have
the Opinion of the said Officers) that no Ship
<PB N="30" REF="96"/>
however sheathed or unsheathed, did ever
make a Voyage to Sea, where her Iron-works
came not home in a <HI>greater</HI> or <HI>less</HI> degree sei∣zed
on, and impaired by <HI>Rust.</HI> Next, That
this <HI>Company</HI> does voluntarily take upon it self
(beyond what by any thing in their <HI>Contract</HI>
they are obliged to) an accountableness for
this their Method's being as secure on behalf
of the King, in reference to this very point of
the Iron-work, as Wood-sheathing, or any o∣ther
hitherto known, can be shewn to have
been.</P>
<P>Which being premised: And forasmuch as
nothing is more <HI>true</HI> in <HI>Fact,</HI> or more legible
in the Records of the <HI>Navy,</HI> than the constant
charge the Crown has been always at for the
shifting and supplying the <HI>defects</HI> of <HI>Iron-works,</HI>
besides what is to be read in the heaps of de∣cayed
Bolts, Rudder-Irons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> rarely missing
in his Majesty's Yards, but after a sale: And
whereas it is no less manifest, that among
the other Instances already spoken of, of the
unequal decay of Iron-works, this is one, <HI>viz.</HI>
That is has not been seldom noted to exceed in
the same Ship while unsheathed, what it has
at another time been, even while in a Lead-sheathing;
witness the forenamed <HI>Phoenix,</HI>
which being furnished with a new <HI>Sett</HI> of Rud∣der-Irons,
at the stripping of that Sheathing in
<HI>Ian.</HI> 1677. and soon after sent so stripp'd to the
<HI>Streights,</HI> was forced in the very same Year,
about <HI>Christmas,</HI> to shift every one of them,
but one Brace, and much of her Bolts, and o∣ther
Iron-works, while (as has been already
noted) she appears not to have shifted so much
<PB N="31" REF="96"/>
as one Bolt, or received any considerable Re∣cruit
of other Iron-work within the whole
seven years of her being Sheathed with Lead,
with which concurrs the case of the <HI>Foresight,</HI>
whose new sett of <HI>Rudder-Irons,</HI> put on in <HI>Ian.</HI>
1672. when unsheathed, were shifted in little
more than a year and an half, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Aug.</HI>
1674. when being Sheathed with Lead, she
continued without any supply of Rudder-Irons
till 1679: Nor do we think it would conduce
a little to the satisfaction of your Lordships,
upon this very head to require a just account
of what has been lately observed in the Ran∣sacking
even of a sheathed (that is to say a
Wood-sheathed) Ship of his Majesty's, where
under the protection of such sheathing, Ships
Iron-work has been reckoned the best secured
against Corrosion; yet even in this case will
your Lordships find upon the forenamed <HI>Hap∣py
Return,</HI> the greatest part of her <HI>Iron-work</HI>
eaten to pieces, and particularly her Bolts
from Stem to Stern.</P>
<P>This Company therefore being in no kind
desirous that his Majesty should be under any
Obligation, of serving himself with their In∣vention,
longer than it shall appear as safe to
his Service and Ships in this particular of Iron-work,
as it has proved it self <HI>Superiour</HI> to that
of <HI>Wood</HI> in every other circumstance, and they
being to that purpose most willing to have the
same determined by the <HI>difference</HI> that shall be
found between the <HI>Charge</HI> his Majesty has been
at for Iron-work for any number of years
backward upon unsheathed, or Wood-sheath∣ed
Ships, and those sheathed with Lead, where
<PB N="32" REF="97"/>
the work thereof in their sheathing and fitting
forth has in other respects been performed,
but with the same ordinary care, and obser∣vation
of the common practice of the Navy.</P>
<P>They come now to offer to your Lordships
that which (and which only) can give you a
full, easie, and uncontrollable account of the
<HI>Truth</HI> in this matter, namely, Your <HI>Order</HI> to
the <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>Navy,</HI> for their directing a
thorough and impartial <HI>Inspection</HI> to be made
into the <HI>Books</HI> of the several <HI>Yards,</HI> with a
particular Account drawn thereout, of what
new Rudder-Irons, Bolts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been for
ten or twelve years last past furnished to any
of his Majesty's Ships, mentioning the Names
of the said Ships, and distinct times of such
their supplies, distinguishing also between such
thereof as were <HI>wholly,</HI> and that were but in
<HI>part</HI> supplied with <HI>new Rudder-Irons,</HI> and men∣tioning
(in the latter case) how many, and
which of the said Irons they were; with a
Report of the result thereof to be made to
your Lordships as soon as it shall be prepa∣red,
and mutually accorded to (for its <HI>Truth</HI>)
between the said Officers, and this Company,
who have nothing more now to add on this
Subject, than the observing to your Lordships,
that had it pleased the Officers of the Navy
to have contributed their furtherance to the
searching out the <HI>Truth</HI> in this <HI>Cause,</HI> with a
zeal equal to what this Company have, to the
best of their understandings ever endeavoured
to express towards it, this work (no more
than that relating to the <HI>Smith</HI>'s) had been at
<PB N="33" REF="97"/>
this day to do, they having made the same o∣verture
to the Lords and them, touching this
very Expedient of <HI>examining</HI> their <HI>Books,</HI> at
the same time with the other in 1678. and
prevailed at length with the said Officers to
issue Orders to the several Yards suitable to this
<HI>Proposal;</HI> but with what success, we humbly
crave your Lordships to receive your satisfa∣ction
from <HI>themselves,</HI> whose producing the
<HI>Returns</HI> thereof from the Yards, (if made)
would at one view have helped your Lord∣ships
to what must be owned by the Officers
of the Navy, for the only, secure, clear and
effectual means of <HI>determining</HI> this <HI>Controversie,</HI>
without either creating to your Lordships, or
continuing upon themselves and us, the trou∣ble
attending this tedious method of Dispute.</P>
<P>But, <HI>My Lords,</HI> that while we speak of <HI>tedious,</HI>
we may render what we are now doing, as little
so to your Lordships, as the Matter put into our
hands, and our Desires after his Majesty's and
your Lordships Satisfaction will permit; we shall
now betake our selves to the last <HI>Article</HI> of our
purpose in this Paper, namely, the opening so
to your Lordships a no less certain view of a <HI>Cure,</HI>
than we hope to have now done of the true
Means of right discovering the <HI>Disease:</HI> For,
My Lords, however astonishing the <HI>Gentlemen</HI>
of the <HI>Navy</HI> seem to make it, that Ships aban∣doned
to all the above mentioned neglects,
and even arts of ruine, should in length of
Time arrive at such a state of weakness, as
to be suspected in their being able to support
themselves above water; We cannot but hold
<PB N="34" REF="98"/>
it a Subject much more fit for <HI>Wonder,</HI> that
they who under the Lord High <HI>Admiral,</HI> are
by the Crown made the first and principal
<HI>Curators</HI> of the Health and Safety of its Ships,
should not only content themselves for several
years together, in joyning with the Cry against
an <HI>Evil,</HI> they describe in Terms so frightful,
without making in all that time any one of∣fer,
or seeming step towards its Remedy, but
publish to all the World a <HI>neglect, contempt,</HI>
and <HI>endeavour</HI> of <HI>Discouraging,</HI> and even direct
withstanding whatever was proposed to that
purpose by any others, as may appear,</P>
<P>(1.) From their open patronizing every of
the Objections and Difficulties that this <HI>In∣vention</HI>
has from the beginning had to contend
with, though so <HI>groundless,</HI> that not one of
them is now thought fit to be remembred in
this their Report to your Lordships Inquisiti∣on,
after the Complaints made against it.</P>
<P>(2.) From the manifest Industry wherewith
(when time was) they laboured to expose it,
by an application of it upon the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and
serving themselves at her return, with the
success of their so doing, towards verifying
their former declaiming against its sufficien∣cies,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Condition it now came home
in upon this Ship all cracked, and rent from
Stem to Stern; whereas the <HI>ingenuity</HI> of their
dealing with us in this particular, had the
misfortune of being first discovered by the
<HI>KING</HI> himself, upon a personal view he was
pleased to take thereof, and his therein observ∣ing
<PB N="35" REF="98"/>
the said Ships being by <HI>age</HI> become so
<HI>decrepit,</HI> as to be brought home by her Com∣pany
with her whole Body woulded about
with <HI>Hawsers</HI> for preventing her very sides
falling out, and Bottom dropping into the Sea.</P>
<P>(3.) From their violation of every of the <HI>Orders</HI>
heretofore mentioned of his Majesty, and Lords of
the <HI>Admiralty</HI> relating to this Affair, one forbid∣ding
(above nine years since) the use of any other
method of Sheathing, than this of Lead, without
<HI>special Order;</HI> whereas the contrary has been pra∣ctised
by them in many Instances. <HI>Another,</HI> for
their sheathing <HI>two Ships,</HI> one with <HI>Lead,</HI> the other
with wood, in express order to a Proof to be made
(upon some difference in Opinion between them∣selves
and one of their own number) touching
the good quality of their <HI>Rudder-Irons: A Third</HI>
for doing the like to the <HI>Norwich,</HI> with Directions
to imploy such Rudder-Irons thereon, as should
be provided by this Company: And a <HI>Fourth</HI>
(inculcated within few dayes by a <HI>Fifth</HI>) for∣bidding
the whole use of any other Rudder-Irons
upon Lead-sheathed Ships, than of this
Company's furnishing: But with so little re∣gard
ever paid to the same, that rather than
any Order, or even the most Essential <HI>Rules</HI>
of the <HI>Navy</HI> should stand in the way of their
prejudice to this <HI>Invention,</HI> they have taken
upon themselves the sending into the mouth of
the <HI>Worm</HI> no small number both of Men of
War, and others of his Majesty's Ships <HI>naked</HI>
in their Hulls, without any security against the
worst effects thereof; which, what they have
been, your Lordships will more properly be
<PB N="36" REF="99"/>
informed in, upon their Return home and Ran∣sacking
from the Officers of the Navy, than
from this Company; some of whose Experi∣ence
nevertheless, and what present Advice
they have received from abroad, will justifie
their saying thus much before hand, that those
Effects will be found of many times <HI>more Charge</HI>
to the King than all that the Complaint now
before your Lordships concerning Rudder-Irons
can be made to amount to.</P>
<P>But, (My Lords,) As these Proceedings
have not heretofore, neither shall they now
discourage this Company from a free Dis∣charge
of their Duty, by opening whatever
Conceptions of theirs they think reasonably
grounded towards the Remedying as well as
Right understanding the <HI>Original</HI> of the <HI>Evil</HI>
laboured under, and a Remedy both Obvious,
Easie, Effectual, and next to being of no Charge,
we take our selves to be Masters of, and shall
lead your Lordships to the concurring with
us in it, by the few steps, or Reflections fol∣lowing,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the only competent and allow∣ed
<HI>Defence</HI> of Ships against the <HI>Worm,</HI> before
this of <HI>Lead-sheathing,</HI> was the paying the Hulls
from the Waters edge downwards with <HI>Stuff,</HI>
and laying the inside of a Sheathing-board (from
inch and quarter to three quarters thick) all
over with <HI>Tarr</HI> and <HI>Hair,</HI> to be brought over
the forementioned Stuff, and being well nailed,
<HI>Graving</HI> or <HI>Paying</HI> the outside of the said Board
all over with another Composition of Brim∣stone,
<PB N="37" REF="99"/>
Oyl, and other Ingredients, which is
called <HI>Wood-sheathing.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning which, however united the O∣pinion
of us. <HI>English</HI> Men may be thought to
have been touching the same, it seems to this
Company grounded not so much upon the re∣al
Perfection thereof, as the <HI>Profit</HI> that attends
it to the <HI>Builders</HI> interested in the working of
it, and consequently, leaving them under no
temptation, either to look out for a <HI>better</HI> them∣selves,
or give encouragement to any discove∣ries
made towards it by others.</P>
<P>And that indeed the so universal Reception
given to <HI>Wood-sheathing,</HI> is rather due to this,
than its own real sufficiency, your Lordships
will be Judges of, from the following Notes.</P>
<P>1. That if not the most, at least the most es∣sential
of all the <HI>Ingredients</HI> employed in that
method of <HI>Sheathing,</HI> are of <HI>Forreign growth;</HI>
which we make use of not so much for the sake
of the Nationality of its Argument, (though
yet that is such as the Parliaments of <HI>England</HI>
have ever laid great weight upon in all their
Deliberations upon Trade, and particularly in
the <HI>Act</HI> relating to this very Invention,) but
from a Consideration which the <HI>Books</HI> of the
Navy sufficiently confirm the force of, <HI>viz.</HI>
That being <HI>Forraign,</HI> such has sometimes been
the <HI>scarcity</HI> thereof here, (even when their use
has been most wanted,) that they have been
either not to be had at all, or at Prizes much
exceeding the ordinary Market.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="100"/>2. That the said <HI>Wood-sheathing</HI> hath been
always observed and confessed to be very apt
to gather Filth, and of no less <HI>uneasieness</HI> when
<HI>fouled</HI> to be thoroughly <HI>cleansed</HI> again.</P>
<P>3. That from its roughness and the multi∣tude
of Nail-heads standing out from the Ships
sides or otherwise, Ships sheathed with <HI>Wood</HI>
have ever been complained of, as lessened
thereby in that only quality upon which our
<HI>Friggats</HI> most value themselves, and have their
Service in preference to others calculated from,
namely, That of their <HI>Sailing;</HI> for proof of
which, your Lordships have not only the Evi∣dence
lately mentioned of the Navy Officers,
choosing to send <HI>naked Ships</HI> to the <HI>Streights,</HI>
when with as little violence to practice and
order, they might have sent them so sheathed;
but that general application, which was here∣tofore
made to his Royal <HI>Highness,</HI> then Lord
High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> by the Flag-Officers
and Commanders of the Fleet, designed under
Sir <HI>Thomas Allen</HI> (as we remember) against the
<HI>Turks,</HI> advising, that as his Majesty would ex∣pect
any success of the said <HI>Fleet</HI> against that
People, he would let his Ships go with all
their virtue of <HI>Sailing</HI> about them <HI>undiminish∣ed</HI>
by <HI>sheathing,</HI> as being (from former Expe∣rience
of the <HI>Turks</HI> out-doing us that way)
taught, that without this, nothing was to be
hoped for of Advantage to be gained upon
them; which Advice of theirs was urged so
pressingly, and justified so fully, that both his
<HI>Royal Highness,</HI> and the then Officers of the Na∣vy
<PB N="39" REF="100"/>
concurred with those of the Fleet, (in the
Council thereupon given his Majesty, and af∣terwards
pursued) rather of exposing the <HI>Hulls</HI>
of his Ships to the worst Effects of the
<HI>Worm,</HI> than hazard the loss both of their whole
Service, and his own Honour by <HI>sheathing,</HI> and
thereby disabling them in this their best quali∣ty
of <HI>Sailing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Which being so, and that therefore
(besides these plain and important <HI>Imperfecti∣ons</HI>
in <HI>Wood-sheathing</HI>) the only <HI>Remedy</HI> hither∣to
thought on, has been to deliver up his Maje∣sty's
Ships to the mercy of the <HI>Worm,</HI> by sending
them abroad wholly unprovided of any Fence a∣gainst
them: This Company takes leave in the
next place humbly to recommend to your Lord∣ships
the <HI>requiring</HI> from the Officers of the Na∣vy
an impartial <HI>Account</HI> of the <HI>condition</HI> where∣in
the Ships of that Fleet of Sir <HI>Thomas Allen</HI>'s
brought home their <HI>Hulls</HI> notwithstanding all
the mighty professions then made by their <HI>Com∣manders</HI>
of the <HI>care</HI> that should be taken in the
frequent turning up of their Bottoms, and use
of the long <HI>Scrubbing-brushes,</HI> then first devised
and introduced into the Navy for the easier
reaching towards their Keeles in the making
of them clean.</P>
<P>And for whatever issue your Lordships are
to expect from the late Liberty taken by these
Gentlemen of doing the like on other Ships at
this day, though it be yet too soon for your
Lordships to expect any certain Account there∣of,
as being a Matter not to be done before
<PB N="40" REF="101"/>
they are brought in and searched; Yet we can∣not
think it will be reckoned any ill measure
for your Lordships to frame your <HI>Expectations</HI>
by therein, to consider the single case of the
<HI>Rupert</HI> in her last Voyage to the <HI>Streights,</HI> un∣der
Captain <HI>Herbert,</HI> which Ship in lieu of be∣ing
according to the Kings Order sheathed
with <HI>Lead,</HI> was by the said Officers Advice,
and the Undertaking of her Commander for
the frequency of her cleaning, sent away <HI>na∣ked</HI>
(saving in her Keel, which was <HI>Leaded</HI>)
with this success, that besides the Apprehensi∣ons
Captain <HI>Herbert</HI> was under concerning her,
even while in the <HI>Streights,</HI> upon what was
then discovered relating to the <HI>Worm,</HI> putting
him upon thoughts (had it been practicable)
of shifting her <HI>Garble-strake</HI> there; The Offi∣cers
of the Navy are well able to inform
your Lordships, that (notwithstanding all that
promised care of Captain <HI>Herbert,</HI> and their
own presumptions thereon) it will be no small
charge to his Majesty to make good the <HI>damage</HI>
she brought home by <HI>Worm-eating.</HI></P>
<P>What then remains after this that has been
said, and lies so easily within your Lordships <HI>pro∣ving,</HI>
touching the <HI>Imperfections</HI> of both these Me∣thods
of <HI>Sheathing</HI> Ships with <HI>Wood,</HI> and expo∣sing
them to Sea without any Sheathing at
all, but the waiting for some <HI>Fourth,</HI> not yet
heard of, or continuing this <HI>Third</HI> under de∣bate,
of Sheathing with Lead, to which
nothing is so much as pretended to, in Ob∣jection
by the Officers of the Navy them∣selves,
but this of its supposed Influence
upon <HI>Iron-work,</HI> as very well knowing,
<PB N="41" REF="101"/>
that no room is left for the least such Pretenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon any one head of what has been ever sug∣gested
to the contrary, especially in those par∣ticular
points of <HI>Imperfections,</HI> wherein that of
<HI>Wood-sheathing,</HI> and sending of Ships abroad
unsheathed, appears (as before) to remain yet
chargeable; <HI>England</HI> being never to be suppo∣sed
unfurnished with Lead, as bearing it with∣in
its own Bowels; Nor any Complaint hi∣therto
heard of, either of its being in any de∣gree
so apt to <HI>foul,</HI> or difficult to <HI>clean</HI> as <HI>Wood,</HI>
Nor lastly, so much as one suggestion ever
made of its injuring Ships in their quality of
<HI>Sailing;</HI> but so much the contrary, that we
are ready in all humility to make our Appeal
to his Majesty himself, whether the <HI>Harwich</HI>
sent in her <HI>Lead-sheathing,</HI> Anno 1677. under
Captain <HI>Killigrew</HI> to the <HI>Streights,</HI> and hurri∣ed
out from <HI>Chatham</HI> under the disadvantage of
not being so much as Tallowed, suffered any
thing from her said <HI>sheathing,</HI> in her virtue of
<HI>Sailing;</HI> or did not outgo all (both Ships and
Yatchs) that were then attending the King with
her, in his passage to the Westward.</P>
<P>But of what satisfaction can this (say the
Officers of the Navy) be, if one <HI>Evil</HI> superi∣our
to all those <HI>Good</HI> qualities (for so they
understand this about the <HI>Iron-work</HI> to be) re∣mains
unremoved?</P>
<P>To which, (My Lords) we come now to
Answer, and in so doing to open to your
Lordships what this <HI>Company</HI> takes to be the
most natural, easie, and thorough <HI>Remedy</HI> thereto,
even though it were <HI>possible</HI> (as they believe,
and doubt not upon proof of what is here

<P>And this your Lordships may please to take
from us in these few following considerations.</P>
<P>1. That after all the noise that has been

this untimely consumption of his Ships <HI>Rud∣der-Irons,</HI>
his full charge for a whole set of
them for a Ship of each of those Rates upon

<P>2. That according to the <HI>Report</HI> of the Na∣vy
Officers themselves, with the <HI>Schedule</HI> of
<HI>Complaints</HI> attending it, and what has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b∣served
by us therein, it is evident that the
<HI>shortest Time</HI> to be supposed for the ordinary▪
<HI>duration</HI> of <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> in <HI>Lead-sheathed</HI> Ships, is
two years and an half, or three years, with∣in
which time no Ship of his Majesty's was
ever known, or can be supposed to want an
opportunity of <HI>Grounding</HI> or <HI>Docking.</HI></P>
<P>3. That (besides the other great advantage
<PB N="43" REF="106"/>
of <HI>cheapness</HI> which <HI>Lead-sheathing</HI> must be own∣ed
to have above that of <HI>Wood</HI>) the <HI>Prices</HI> in
this <HI>Table</HI> (were they of ten times the value)
would not bring the <HI>charge</HI> of <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> to
any equality of consideration with the <HI>Evils</HI>
lately recounted in both the other methods of
Sheathing with <HI>Wood,</HI> or not <HI>sheathing</HI> at all.</P>
<P>4. And that therefore in the last place, for∣asmuch
as universal consent and practice al∣lows
the laying them with <HI>Tarr</HI> and <HI>Hair</HI>
under <HI>Lead,</HI> to be a certain security to Ships
<HI>Iron-works</HI> under water against <HI>Rust,</HI> at least
for so much as concerns their <HI>Bolts:</HI> And that
therefore the only thing we seem now to be
in care for, is the <HI>supplying</HI> the Consumption
that may happen during the Voyage in their
<HI>Rudder-Irons,</HI> which (were fresh ones in the
way) no Ship (as is already shewn,) can at
her <HI>Grounding</HI> or <HI>Docking</HI> want opportunities
of doing by shifting them; what then (in one
word) can be more demonstrable than that a
<HI>spare Set</HI> thereof sent to Sea with every <HI>Lead-sheathed</HI>
Ship (answerable to what is daily done
in materials of much greater charge, and for
uses of less consequence) is a no less easie than
ready and <HI>Effectual Remedy</HI> to all the damage
that can be apprehended incident to a Ship up∣on
this head of <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> in any Voyage not
exceeding five or six years continuance.</P>
<P>Nor (may it please your Lordships) do we
offer this as a new Resort whereto this <HI>Report</HI>
of the Navy Officers may be thought to have
driven us at this day; Forasmuch as it is no
more than what in the same Terms this <HI>Com∣pany</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="107"/>
proposed in the year 1678, to the then
<HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> and the Officers of the
<HI>Navy,</HI> when upon the like considerations then
urged, their Lordships were pleased not only
to <HI>approve</HI> it, but by their express <HI>Order</HI> of the
12th of <HI>April</HI> in that year, to require the said
Officers (amongst other things) to receive
from this Company such <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> as should
be by them provided, upon a Proposition they
had then made of furnishing his Majesty's <HI>Lead-sheathed</HI>
Ships with that Commodity, not only
for their present use at the time of their Sheath∣ing,
but for a <HI>Reserve</HI> to answer accidents du∣ring
their Voyages.</P>
<P>Which <HI>Order</HI> (if executed) must have long
agoe with little charge, and less trouble, put
an end to this clamorous <HI>Evil,</HI> (wherever the
<HI>cause</HI> of it should at length have been found to
lye) and would (by preventing the <HI>great</HI> da∣mages
his Majesty is supposed to have sustain∣ed
from it,) have furnished the said Officers
with a much better Expedient of testifying
their regards to the King, and his Service:
Their Duty to your Lordships, and the Lords
your Predecessors; Their heedfulness to the
Established Methods of the <HI>Navy,</HI> and their
own parts declared therein: And lastly, their
good will to these the humble <HI>Endeavours</HI> and
early <HI>Proposals</HI> of this <HI>Company</HI> for the Service
of his Majesty on this occasion, than thus
by their own <HI>Failures,</HI> first not to prevent these
Damages, next to <HI>prolong</HI> them, and then
to <HI>complain</HI> of them.</P>

The Humble MEMORIAL of

Interested in the

OF
Milled-Lead.</HEAD>
<P>Shewing,
THat His Majesty and my Lords of the
Council having (out of the same Consi∣deration
of its Importance to the King, which led
your Lordships first to the laying it before them)
been pleased by their <HI>Order</HI> of 22 <HI>Decemb.</HI> last,
to Referr back to your Lordships the Business
in Controversie between the Officers of the
Navy and this Company touching <HI>Lead-sheath∣ing:</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="112"/>
These are humbly to acquaint your
Lordships that as we are, and shall at all times
be ready to answer any Commands which you
shall think fit to direct to this Company in re∣lation
thereto; so do we hold our selves bound,
in Right no less to his Majesty and your Lord∣ships
than our selves, to remove a Prejudice
which the said Officers did lately offer at the
raising (before his Majesty in Council) a∣gainst
what we had then, and may yet have
further Occasion of saying in this Debate, by
a suggestion of our being governed by Consi∣derations
of <HI>Self-interest,</HI> while <HI>themselves</HI> would
be thought removed above all suspicion of any
other End herein than that of <HI>His Majesties</HI>
Service.</P>
<P>In <HI>Answer</HI> whereto we shall only crave leave
to say, That as to that Uninterestedness so pre∣tended
to by them, it is too manifest, that their
obtaining from your Lordships a suddain Con∣demnation
of this Method of <HI>Lead-sheathing,</HI> is
the only Expedient they have for preventing
the Effects of that Enquiry (which the Wisdom
of His Majesty and the Lords of the Council
have been so pleased to recommend to your
Lordships) into the particulars of our Answer,
leading your Lordships to the several Failures
in Duty and breach of Orders reflected on
them by us in relation to this Affair, and the
Prejudices sustained therefrom by his Ma∣jesty.</P>
<P>And for what concerns the <HI>Self-interest</HI> sug∣gested
to lye on our side, we shall only Note,

<P><PB N="56" REF="117"/>1. That under all the Discouragements and
Oppositions our Invention has for twelve
Years together been treated with by them, we
never have given them nor our selves the trou∣ble
of making one Complaint to his Majesty
or your Lordships concerning them, saving
what has been extorted from us in our ne∣cessary
<HI>Reply</HI> to their late <HI>Report</HI> to your Ho∣nourable
<HI>Board</HI> on this Subject; nor in the
whole four Years last past (wherein they have
for ought appears both without, and contra∣trary
to <HI>Order,</HI> taken upon them the Exercising,
even <HI>that,</HI> which is the very Matter of the pre∣sent
Controversie, namely the Adviseableness
of laying aside the use of <HI>Lead-sheathing</HI>) have
we ever made one Application to them for re∣moving
or so much as enquiring into the Rea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on
on their so doing.</P>
<P>2. That had there been the least sollicitude
on our parts after our private benefit, it would
have easily prompted us to a much greater re∣servedness
of Style than your Lordships find us
using on this occasion towards the said Offi∣cers,
upon whose <HI>good-will</HI> alone the success
of ours, and all other Contracts with the Na∣vy,
is well known wholly to depend: Nor
does this <HI>Company</HI> need to appeal to any other
Evidence than your selves for the Fidelity of
their Proceeding in this Matter towards His
Majesty, in preference to any thoughts of pri∣vate
Advantage, after that Declaration under
our Hands, wherewith we Prefaced our very
first Paper to your Lordships on this Occasion;
<PB N="57" REF="117"/>
not only of our Consent but Desires, that <HI>No
Considerations relating to the Interest or Right of
this Company, might stand in the way of whatso∣ever
His Majesty and your Lordships should think
most for his Service to determine concerning it.</HI></P>
<P>3. That (besides the many other Advantages
arising to His Majesty from this <HI>Invention</HI>) the
saving of his Treasure will we doubt not in
your Enquiry be found concerned in a no less
Degree than that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">60 <HI>per Cent.</HI> was thought fit as encourage∣ment enough to be mentioned, though Mr. <HI>Pepys</HI> who also penned this Memorial with Sir <HI>Ant. Dean</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hewer,</HI> found by their Calculations the King had and might save by the use of this Sheathing above 150 <HI>per Cent.</HI> besides the great benefit of securing the Hulls of his Ships against the Worm, without hinderance to their sailing: Their Calculations the Publisher hath in Mr. <HI>Hewer</HI>'s Hand-writing by him.</NOTE> of 60 <HI>l.</HI> or a much greater
summe <HI>per Cent.</HI> through the whole of his Ex∣pence
of <HI>Lead-sheathing</HI> compared with that of
<HI>Wood,</HI> or sending Ships to Sea Unsheathed:
Upon which Consideration, and of the good
Husbandry the present State of his Majesty's
Treasure, seems in so particular a measure at
this time to call for; as also for our fuller
Discharge against the Consequences of any Mi∣stake
that may attend the issue of a Debate of
such Importance to the Royal Navy of <HI>England,</HI>
We do on his Majesty's-behalf humbly pray,
and must take leave to insist upon with your

Lordships, not only that the Contents of our
late <HI>Reply</HI> in this Cause may receive your due
Construction and Examination with respect
to what we have therein, and do still assert
touching the True Causes and Remedy of the
Evil in Controversie about Ships <HI>Iron-works:</HI>
But that whatsoever your Lordships shall in
Order to his Majesty's Service (which alone
we again desire your having any regard to)
find Cause of requiring further from the said
Officers on this Subject, may be mutually trans∣acted
between us in Writing, and not other∣wise:

<OPENER>To the Honourable
The Principal

OF HIS
MAJESTY's NAVY.</OPENER>
<HEAD>A Proposal of Mr. Kent and Part∣ners
concerned in the Work of
Mill'd-Lead, to Sheath his Ma∣jesty's
Ships with the said Lead,
for preservation of their Plank
against the Worm, which way of
Sheathing is plainly much better
for Sayling, cheaper and more
durable than any other way hi∣therto
used.</HEAD>
<P>IT is humbly offered to your Consideration,
that when this way of <HI>Milling Lead</HI> for
<HI>Sheathing</HI> of Ships was first invented, it was
immediately communicaed to the late King,
<PB N="61" REF="119"/>
and his present Majesty then <HI>Lord High Ad∣miral
of England,</HI> and the Usefulness of the <HI>In∣vention</HI>
by them well weighed and considered,
and thought to be of such consequence, that
his Majesty gave the <HI>Inventors</HI> encouragement
and advice to lay the same before the <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI>
where, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter a most strict scrutiny into
the Matter in both Houses, they obtained in
the Year 1670. an <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> with
Terms in it highly expressing the good Opini∣on
they had conceived of this <HI>Invention.</HI></P>
<P>After which by his Majesty's particular di∣rection
it was first tryed upon several of his
own Ships; but the interest several Persons
(trading in the Materials formerly used in
<HI>Sheathing</HI>) had to oppose this <HI>Invention,</HI> did
make them very iudustrious to raise Objecti∣ons
against it, all which being throughly ex∣amined
by his late Majesty, and a View by him
in Person made of the Ship <HI>Phoenix</HI> after two
Voyages to the <HI>Streights</HI> with the same Sheath∣ing,
it pleased his Majesty by his Order of
20<HI>th. Decemb.</HI> 1673. to signifie his pleasure that
for the future <HI>this</HI> way of <HI>Sheathing</HI> and no
other should be used upon his Majesty's Ships,
by the then Lords of the Admiralty, in these
words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>After our hearty Commendations; in pursuance
of his Majesty's Pleasure signified to us by
himself, at this Board; That in regard of the
many and good Proofs which had been given of
the usefulness of Sir <HI>Philip Howard</HI> and Ma∣jor
<HI>Watson</HI>'s Invention of Sheathing his Ma∣jesty's
Ships with Lead, in preference to the
<PB N="62" REF="120"/>
doing of it with the Materials, and in the
manner anciently used, and with respect had
no less to the charge thereof, than the effe∣ctual
securing the Hulls of his Majesty's Ships
against the Worms, his Majesty's Ships may
for the time to come be sheathed in no other
manner than that of Lead, without special Or∣der
given for the same from this Board: These
are to authorize you to cause this his Maje∣sty's
pleasure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erein to be duely complyed with.

<P>And after two Years further experience, the
then <HI>Navy-Board</HI> thought it for his Majesty's
Service to <HI>Contract</HI> with the Mill'd-Lead Part∣ners
for the Materials to sheath his Ships at the
Rates expressed in their Articles of Agreement
during their whole term of their Act of Par∣liament.
And thus stood the Matter 'till the
close of the Year 1675. at which time (as we
humbly conceive, by the Artifice of the inte∣rested
Traders) was raised a Clamour never
heard of before, as if <HI>this</HI> way of <HI>Sheathing</HI> did
occasion a more than ordinary <HI>Decay</HI> of the
<HI>Rudder-Irons.</HI></P>
<P>This immediately put the Partners upon a
strict enquiry into the Truth and validity of
these Objections, and it was not long e're they
<PB N="63" REF="120"/>
fully discovered that this decay in the Iron-work
proceeded not from the contrariety of
the Nature of <HI>Lead</HI> with the matter of <HI>Iron,</HI>
but that the <HI>Iron-work</HI> lasted or decayed, as it
was better or worse mixt and wrought by
the Smith, for such <HI>different decays</HI> as are char∣ged
could never proceed from one common
Cause: His late Majesty himself was convin∣ced
that there was not such corrosive quality
in <HI>Lead,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Boyle.</HI></NOTE> having consulted the Person in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
the most skilful in those matters.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Universal Practice both in his
Majesties Yards, and Merchant Builders has
and does at this day make <HI>Lead</HI> the common
security of <HI>Iron-work</HI> against Rust, not only by
covering therewith (upon all Ships unsheath∣ed,
and designed for long Voyages) the <HI>Iron-work</HI>
about the Rudder, but by <HI>capping</HI> the heads
of their <HI>Bolts</HI> under water with pieces of <HI>Lead</HI>
sized to and nailed over the said <HI>Bolts.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this all, for at this day whatever
Merchant Man, or Man of War is appointed
for a Voyage, where the <HI>Worm</HI> eats, the back
of her <HI>Stem-post</HI> and beard of her <HI>Rudder</HI> are
sheathed with <HI>Copper</HI> or <HI>Lead,</HI> and this even
where the Ships also are sheathed with <HI>Wood,</HI>
the <HI>East: India</HI> Company it self, (upon whom
we may best depend for Cautions wherever
preservation of Ships is in question) not omit∣ting
in that very case to sheath their <HI>Rudders</HI>
with <HI>Lead</HI> or <HI>Copper,</HI> which practice certainly
could never have prevailed with our Fathers,
and been followed with so continued a con∣sent
to this very day by us, of the vicinity of
either of these Metals, assisted (as is by some
<PB N="64" REF="121"/>
imagined,) by salt-water, had been ever found of
so pernicious and certain ill effect upon the very
matter they are employed to secure.</P>
<P>Nor does what is thus approved of in the gene∣ral
and universal practice of <HI>England</HI> want its
Confirmation by the like of Forraign Nations,
to wit, the <HI>Dutch, Portuguese</HI>'s, <HI>Spaniard;</HI> the
first of which like us do generally sheath their
<HI>Rudder-Irons,</HI> and the back of their posts with <HI>Lead</HI>
or <HI>Copper,</HI> upon all Ships bound in the way
of the <HI>Worm;</HI> and for the two latter, not on∣ly
the Rudders, but the whole Bodies of their
Ships under water, even of the <HI>Gallions</HI> them∣selves,
have of long time been, and are well
known at this day to be entirely sheathed with
Lead, which concurrence of these two latter
Nations, seems in this case so much more con∣siderable
than any other, by how much not
only their Voyages are the longest, their ha∣zards
therein from the <HI>Worm</HI> the greatest, and
Cargoes the most valuable of all that Naviga∣tion
knows, but for that the <HI>Hulls</HI> of their
Ships abound the most with Iron-work, as
having all which in the fastening of our Plank
is performed with <HI>Wooden Trunnels,</HI> done by
them with large <HI>Spikes</HI> of <HI>Iron.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, were this spoil of Iron-work charge∣able
with nothing but what is contained in
the <HI>Lead</HI> and <HI>Nails,</HI> these pretended effects of
theirs would be <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>uniform</HI> in all Ships
alike sheathed; whereas nothing is more fre∣quent
than the instances of their <HI>Inequality,</HI>
and this Company dare put the whole Credit
of their Cause upon that one Issue, <HI>viz.</HI> of
ever finding an equal Consumption of the Iron-work
<PB N="65" REF="121"/>
under water, whether upon the same
or different Ships at any one time, or equal
distances of time: The complaint of Ships
that have passed this way of sheathing afford∣ing
a most ample proof of this <HI>inequality,</HI> by
having some of them loaden with Complaints,
and every one different from the rest, and at
different times from it self, whilst we are yet
to be told whether the rest are not (as we
are sure by the long lasting of the <HI>Iron-work</HI>
some of them were) free from all ground of
this Complaint, and upon Information of se∣veral
<HI>Masters</HI> of Ships and other Sea-faring
Men, even upon Ships that were sheathed with
Lead, or not sheathed at all, they have found
the Rudder-Irons of some to decay much soon∣er
than others, which they alwayes imputed
to the Smiths different mixture, welding and
working of the Iron.</P>
<P>To justifie therefore the goodness and use∣fulness
of this their Invention, the Partners
in the Year 1678. made a <HI>Proposal</HI> to the then
<HI>Navy Board,</HI> to furnish the <HI>Rudder-Irons</HI> for
the Ships they should sheath, in which they
would take care themselves of the good mix∣ture,
welding and working thereof, which
Proposal was thought so reasonable that
upon it several repeated Orders to that
Board were made by the Lords of the Ad∣miralty.</P>
<P>Thus stood the matter in the Year 1678.
about which time some differences arose a∣mongst
the Partners themselves, which gave
an interruption to their Proceedings, and an
opportunity to those whose Interest it was
<PB N="66" REF="122"/>
(by reason of their respective Trades) to <HI>de∣cry</HI>
this <HI>Invention,</HI> though it was apparently of
so great advantage to the Kings service; but
at present all differences being reconciled,
and the Interest in the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> fallen
into such hands as are both willing and able
to set it on foot, they thought it their Duty
to lay a <HI>new Proposal</HI> before your Honourable
<HI>Board,</HI> which they do the more gladly, for
that they know you all to be Persons through∣ly
acquainted with, and skilful in these Mat∣ters,
and most Zealous in the Profits and In∣terests
of his Majesty.</P>
<P>They crave leave to begin with reminding
you of some Arguments, which no doubt have
formerly lain before some of you, of the
<HI>advantage</HI> that will accrue by the use of this
way of sheathing above that of <HI>Wood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the only competent and allow∣ed
defence of Ships against the <HI>Worm,</HI> before
this of <HI>Lead-sheathing,</HI> was the paying the <HI>Hulls</HI>
from the waters edge downwards with <HI>Stuff,</HI>
and laying the inside of a sheathing board
(from inch and quarter to three quarters thick)
all over with <HI>Tarr</HI> and <HI>Hair</HI> to be brought
over the forementioned stuff; and (being well
nailed) <HI>graving</HI> or <HI>paying</HI> the outside of the
said Board all over with another compositi∣on
of <HI>Brimstone, Oyl,</HI> and other Ingredients,
which is called <HI>Wood-sheathing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Concerning which, however uni∣ted
the opinions of us <HI>English</HI> men may be
thought to have been touching the same, it
<PB N="67" REF="122"/>
seems to this Company grounded not so much
upon the real perfection thereof, as the pro∣fit
that attends it to the <HI>Builders</HI> interested in
the working of it, and consequently leaving
them under no temptation either to look out
for a better themselves, or give encourage∣ment
to any discoveries made towards it by
others.</P>
<P>And that indeed the so universal reception
given to <HI>Wood-sheathing</HI> is rather due to <HI>this,</HI>
than its own real sufficiency, you will be Judg∣es
of from the following Notes.</P>
<P>1. That if not the most, at least the most
essential of all the Ingredients, employ∣ed
in that method of <HI>Sheathing</HI> are of
<HI>forraign</HI> growth, which they make use
of not so much for the sake of the Nati∣onality
of its Argument, (though yet that
is such as the Parliaments of <HI>England</HI>
have ever laid great weight upon in all
their Deliberations upon Trade, and par∣ticularly
in the <HI>Act</HI> relating to this very
<HI>Invention</HI>) but from a consideration, which
the Books of the <HI>Navy</HI> sufficiently confirm
the force of, <HI>viz,</HI> That being <HI>Forraign,</HI> such
has sometimes been the scarcity thereof
here, (even when their use has been the
most wanted,) that they have been either
not to be had at all, or at Prices much
exceeding the ordinary Market; where∣as
the <HI>Materials</HI> used by the Cop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtners
are of the <HI>Product</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and so can
never be wanting.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="123"/>2. That the <HI>Wood-sheathing</HI> hath been al∣wayes
observed and confessed to be very
apt to gather <HI>filth,</HI> and of no less unea∣siness
when foul'd to be throughly
cleansed again.</P>
<P>3. That from its <HI>roughness,</HI> and the mul∣titude
of Nail-heads standing out from the
Ships side, or otherwise, and the <HI>thick∣ness</HI>
of the <HI>sheathing</HI> it self, Ships sheathed
with <HI>Wood</HI> have ever been complained of
as lessened thereby in that only quality,
upon which our <HI>Friggats</HI> most value them∣selves,
and have their service in preference
to others calculated from, namely, their
<HI>Sailing.</HI></P>
<P>All these Arguments they humbly hope
have given you full satisfaction of the prefe∣rence
this way of sheathing ought to have, and
likewise hope they have answered all Ob∣jections
to it.</P>
<P>They crave leave therefore to begin their
<HI>new Proposal</HI> with these Assertions.</P>
<P>1. That this sheathing with Lead, at the
first hanging on, is, if at all, very incon∣siderably
dearer than a good <HI>Streights</HI>
sheathing with <HI>Wood.</HI></P>
<P>2. That the <HI>Wood-sheathing</HI> never lasts above
a Voyage or two, and when stript the
old sheathing is worth little or nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="123"/>3. That this <HI>Lead-sheathing</HI> with some small
repairs will preserve the Plank from the
<HI>Worm,</HI> (which is the true intent of sheath∣ing
Ships) till it shall be required to be
stript off for Calking, or other reparati∣on
of the Hull when that shall be neces∣sary,
but will never need stripping for
any defect in the sheathing it self; and
when it shall be stript, the old sheathing
being <HI>Metal,</HI> will yield its value to melt
down again.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="summary of proposal">
<HEAD>To reduce this Work to a certainty of
great and undeniable Benefit and
Advantage to his Majesty, they offer
as followeth.</HEAD>
<P>1. THat the Ships sides being prepared (and
the <HI>Bolt-heads</HI> and <HI>Braces</HI> parcelled or

worth speaking of, but all Ships (as far as I
see) the Plank proved as good as those which
were sheathed with Board: As to the Bolts
and Braces, I dare engage they may be secu∣red

were sheathed with Lead very tight, when the

<HEAD>A Letter from the Master-Builder of
Portsmouth to the Lord Churchil.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Answer to your Lordships Letter, my
Opinion of Lead-sheathing is, That it is
the finest and cleanest Sheathing in the world,
and as for the destruction of the Bolts; I say
when well parcelled, no defect can come
from the Lead-sheathing; for I have made it
my observation, That where the Bolt heads
are carefully parcelled (as they are or ought
to be in a Wood-sheathing) no defect is
found, but where that is neglected, the wa∣ter
getting between the Bolt-head and the
Lead, there both the Lead and Iron are usu∣ally
decayed: But I find that his Majesties
Ships in ten or twelve years are generally
Iron-sick, whether sheathed either way or not
sheathed at all, by reason of the builg water.
And as to the Rudder-Irons, I find that the Pin∣tells
decay soonest, but that an unconstant
and unequal decay in the said Iron are in all
Ships, is most certain, sheathed or not, and
according to the goodness and well work∣ing
of the Iron, some prove of longer du∣rance
than other, the soon decay I cannot
impute to the Lead-sheathing, but if such de∣cay
were, hanging the Rudder Flemish Fa∣shion,
'tis easie to unhang the same, and up∣on
such decay to hang on new ones, the Bra∣ces
being much more durable than the Pin∣tells:
And as Wood-sheathing requires to
<PB N="80" REF="129"/>
be stript once in three years, where the
Worm eats, so my Opinion is, that a Lead-sheathing
ought to be stript once in seven
years, by reason of the Ochams decaying in
the Seams; (the which would lye on much
longer, and be firm, were it not for such
decay) and as to its fouling, it fouls nothing
near so soon as a Wood-sheathing, and when
foul is easily cleaned with brushes, or Scra∣pers
if barnicled, with very little trouble,
it will also endure a handsome fire to dry
the same if occasion requires; and when
this Sheathing is stript, the Plank is no wise
damaged by the Worm as we ever found:

<HEAD>A Letter from Sir Phineas Pet, Com∣missioner
at Chatham, to my Lord
Churchil.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Answer to your Lordships Letter, de∣siring
my opinion of the Lead-sheathing,
and the Complaints that some have made a∣gainst
the Rudder-Irons and Bolts of seve∣ral
of the Lead-sheathed Ships, I return your
Lordship this general Account following,
which I suppose will give your Lordship
<PB N="81" REF="129"/>
full satisfaction. While I was his Majesties
Master Builder here at <HI>Chatham,</HI> it fell into
my way to sheath and strip divers of those
Ships, by which I had opportunity enough
to make full observations, as well in re∣spect
of the Iron-work as sheathing; and I
must confess after I had seen some of those
Ships return from their Voyages, as the <HI>Ly∣on,
Henrietta</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> with their sheathing
firm and sound, free from the Worm, and
very clean, I look'd upon this sheathing as
a very happy Invention for his Majesties
Service, to have his Friggats thus secured
from the Worm, without hinderance to their
Sailing, which a thick Wood-sheathing must
needs be; and by reason of its duration, the
charge that was saved in Graving, and the
value of the old sheathing (being Mettal)
when stript must needs be considerably cheap∣er
to the King, and I am of the same Opi∣nion
still, though I have heard divers Com∣manders
and others say, this Sheathing is
an extraordinary decayer of the Iron-work,
which they may fancy by taking notice only
of some particular Ships that perhaps may
have had their Rudder-Irons last a shorter
time with a Lead-sheathing, than they have
observed some other Ships that have been
sheathed with Wood, being not acquainted
with the searching and repairs of Iron-work
in Ships of all kinds as Shipwrights are; for
this great inequality we constantly find in
the lasting of the Rudder-Irons, and other
Iron-work in all Ships, whether sheathed
either way, or not at all, may not be known
<PB N="82" REF="130"/>
to them, which we always look upon to
come from the Smith, in the better or worse
mixing, welding, and working his Iron:
Nor can I imagine how the Lead-sheathing
should be any cause of the great decay in
Iron-work, for we use in Wood-sheathing
to Capp the Bolt-heads with Lead, and ma∣ny
times to sheath the Rudder-Post, and
Beard of the Rudder with Lead. And for
the Nails, their Heads are so thin and small,
that I do not see how they should continue
so long in the sides of a Ship, (as some of
these Ships have been sheathed,) and at strip∣ping
appear not at all to be diminished in their
substance, and yet communicate such a cor∣roding
mischief to the Iron-work as some
would have it; but if such a thing were,
well parcelling the Bolts would secure them,
and the Rudder-Irons can decay in no Voy∣age
so fast, but by having a fresh set always
on Board, opportunity may be found time
enough to shift them, which would very
well be contrived, rather than to lose so many
other great Benefits that Lead-sheathing
brings with it to his Majesties Service as
well as to the Publick. This is I think the
substance of what your Lordship would be
satisfied in; and if you desire any thing more
particularly, you may command</P>

Confirmation, by an Act granted to that Effect,
in Terms most Expressive of their satisfaction
in it, and Intentions of Encouragement to its
<HI>Inventors.</HI></P>
<P>After which, it was by his Majesties Com∣mand
immediately put in Execution, first up∣on
the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> and then successively upon o∣ther
of his Ships. But not without continued
Industry and Combinations employed against
it, by Persons interested so to do, until by a three
years proof of its Efficacy, in contradiction
to all that had been objected against it, and
more particularly from the satisfaction his Ma∣jesty
received concerning it, in his personal
View and Observation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its success upon the
<HI>Phoenix;</HI> he was pleased to put an end to the same
in the Year 1673. by an Order from the then
<HI>Lords of the Admiralty,</HI> solemnly establishing
this Method of sheathing, in Exclusion to all
that had been till then used in the Navy.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="133"/>Notwithstanding which, the said <HI>Officers</HI>
thought fit to take yet two <HI>Years</HI> more for its

<P>All this neverthesess not sufficing against the

new Exception was soon after rais'd, upon
the score of a Pretended Discovery made of
some Occult Quality in the Lead, by which
the <HI>Rudder-Irons,</HI> and other Iron-works of his

recommend and press upon the Officers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of
the <HI>Navy,</HI> the making a strict Enquiry into
the General Truth, and Natural Ground of
the Evil so complain'd of; but upon a reason∣able
suggection then made by this Company,
of its being rather chargeable upon some De∣fect
in the <HI>Iron-work</HI> it self, than ought to be
apprehended from the Lead, They were plea∣sed
to direct several <HI>Ships</HI> to be expresly fit∣ted,
<PB N="89" REF="133"/>
and other things done by the said <HI>Officers</HI>
in conjunction with this Company, in order
to the better discovery of the Truth in that
Particular; but without any regard shewn
either to those <HI>Orders,</HI> or to the Importance
of their Contents to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> by any thing
that appears to have been done towards it by
the said <HI>Officers,</HI> from that very day to the
Date of this <HI>Report</HI> in <HI>October</HI> last, wherein
(upon the single score of its suppos'd Influ∣ence
upon <HI>Iron,</HI>) they take upon them peremp∣torily
to Advise against the further use of
<HI>Lead-sheathing,</HI> without any other Evidence of
the Truth or Ground of that their Supposal,
than what is to be inferred from a Particular
thereto annex'd, of the Decays of <HI>Iron-work</HI>
observ'd upon some of the <HI>Lead-sheathed</HI>
Ships.</P>
<P>The invalidity of which Instances being se∣verally
opened by this Company, with respect
no less to their Truth, Consistencies, and
Cogency, than to their Disproportion in Num∣ber
to those of the like sheathing, against
which nothing of Complaint has been suggest∣ed
by them; The Company proceeds to shew,</P>
<P>I. That the sheathing of Ships with <HI>Lead,</HI>
neither is nor can (as such) be the Cause of
any decay in <HI>Iron:</HI> And this,</P>
<P>1. From the Universal Consent of Persons
of the most allowed Knowledge in the <HI>Theory</HI>
and Operation of Metals.</P>
<P>2. From the Universal <HI>Practice</HI> (both An∣cient
and Modern) of the <HI>Shipwrights</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="134"/>
in their special Application of Lead to
the preserving of <HI>Iron-work.</HI></P>
<P>3. From the like Practice in <HI>Forraign Nations.</HI></P>
<P>4. From their Observations touching the
unequal growth of Rust upon <HI>Iron-work,</HI> with∣in
the same or different spaces of Time, and
on the same or different Ships, however
<HI>sheathed</HI> or <HI>unsheathed.</HI></P>
<P>II. That the Real <HI>Causes</HI> to which alone this
extraordinary decay of the <HI>Iron-work</HI> is of right
to be imputed, are,</P>
<P>1. The want of due <HI>Inspection</HI> to the perfor∣mance
of the <HI>Smiths</HI> Work.</P>
<P>2. An industrious <HI>Omission</HI> (in the particu∣lar
Case of these Ships) of the Principal Point
of Care used both in his Majesties and Mer∣chants
Service, in the preparing of all Ships
designed for sheathing.</P>
<P>3. An Unaccountable <HI>Continuance</HI> of the
sheathing upon the Bodies of these Ships, be∣yond
what the Practice and Rules of the Na∣vy,
in the case of any such Neglects can ju∣stifie.</P>
<P>III. Lastly, That an Enquiry into the <HI>Books</HI>
of Iron-Work in his Majesties Yards, is the
only, and would long e're now (had this Com∣pany's
Advice been pursued) have been found
an effectual and certain Expedient for the com∣ing
to a right decision of this Question.</P>
<P>Which being said, and an Account given of
the several <HI>Obstructions</HI> and <HI>Discouragements,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="134"/>
which both his <HI>Majesties</HI> Service, and this <HI>Com∣pany</HI>
have met with from the Officers of the
<HI>Navy,</HI> in all its Endeavours of bringing this
Matter to a Satisfactory Issue to his Majesty:
The Company concludes with shewing these
three things,</P>
<P>1. That sheathing with <HI>Wood</HI> (the only
security for <HI>Ships</HI> against the <HI>Worm,</HI> before
this of <HI>Lead</HI>) is, and has always been owned
to be, attended with several Circumstances
greatly Detrimental to his Majesty, both in
his Ships and Service.</P>
<P>2. That the only Expedient also, besides this
of <HI>Lead,</HI> for obviating those Evils in <HI>Wood-sheathing,</HI>
has been the flying to another <HI>Evil,</HI>
no less fit to be avoided than they, <HI>viz.</HI> That
of sending the Kings Ships into the <HI>Worms</HI>
way <HI>unsheathed.</HI></P>
<P>3. Lastly, That therefore the only Me∣thod
in reserve (yet known) for the serving
of his Majesty herein, is this of <HI>Lead.</HI> Against
which, none of the Evils in either of the for∣mer,
or any other, are (after near <HI>Twelve years</HI>
Experience of it) so much as suggested by the
Officers of the <HI>Navy</HI> themselves at this Day,
saving this under dispute concerning <HI>Iron-work;</HI>
To which, (after all) the Company closes
with Proposing a most obvious, easie, next to
chargeable, and effectual <HI>Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>For the Particulars of which, and each of
the foregoing Matters, reference is to be had
to their <HI>Original Paper,</HI> lying before his Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esty

<HEAD>AN
ADVERTISEMENT
To all who have Occasion to make Use of
Sheet-Lead.</HEAD>
<P>ALL New Inventions (being proposed (as
better and cheaper) to lay aside some∣thing
before used for the same purpose) must
expect to meet with great Opposition; for
some particular Persons, and some Trades
which consist of many Persons being concern'd
in Point of Interest, right or wrong, they will
decry that which is against their profit, and
procure as many others as they can to do so
too; this being the Case o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Plumbers</HI> with
those Concerned in the <HI>Milled-Lead,</HI> whoever
has Occasion to make use of <HI>Sheet-Lead</HI> ought
not to regard what interested Persons say on
either side, but to weigh and consider with
himself the Reasons offered, and to examine
the truth of what's said on both sides: The
Mill'd-Lead Company have Printed many of
their Reasons some time since, in a Paper at
large: amongst which, to say nothing of its
solidity, smoothness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Equality</HI> of <HI>Mill'd
Lead</HI> alone is sufficient to prove it much bet∣ter,
<PB N="94" REF="136"/>
and (at the Companys Rates in propor∣tion
to the least <HI>Inequality</HI> that can be granted
in <HI>Cast-Lead</HI>) much cheaper, which also may fur∣ther
appear from the Considerations following.</P>
<P>1. It is agreed by all, that if the <HI>Plumber</HI>
could cast his Lead exactly Equal to the thin∣nest
part thereof, it would be better than to
be thicker in one place than another, so that
the excess of thickness is not only unnecessa∣rily
paid for, but it makes the Sheet worse,
and helps to crack and cockle the thinner parts,
by its stronger resisting the Sun-beams, and
other Accidents of Weather, which falling e∣qually
on all parts alike, draws the thinner
parts, when the thicker stay behind, which
causes that Cockling and cracking therein:
Wherefore, if Mill'd Lead be thicker than the
thinnest part of a cast Sheet, it must be allow∣ed
to be better, and to last longer, and a
less quantity of Lead being employed, it may
be <HI>cheaper</HI> to what degree in proportion to
<HI>Cast Lead</HI> the Customer shall judge it conve∣nient
and sufficient for the purpose designed
to have the <HI>thickness</HI> of his Mill'd-Lead to be of.</P>
<P>2. The wasting and decay of <HI>Sheet-Lead</HI> be∣ing
chiefly beneath by the heat and moisture
contracted between it and the plain it lyes
on (turning it into White-Lead,) that acci∣dent
which the <HI>thinner</HI> as well as the <HI>thicker</HI>
parts are alike liable to, shews the great mischief
that attends a Cast-Lead covering in this re∣spect
also.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="136"/>3. These particulars as well as the <HI>Plumbers</HI>
vain pretence to near <HI>Equality,</HI> and endea∣vour
to cast as equal as he can, shews the ex∣cellency
of Equality in Sheet-Lead, and con∣sequently
that it is so much the worse, by how
much it deviates from <HI>Equalily,</HI> and this <HI>Ine∣quality</HI>
in a sheet of Lead being an Object of
Sense, any Man that has but his eyes in his
head may be as good a Judge thereof as the
best Architect, Surveyor or Plumber in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
and if he please but to give himself
the trouble of viewing indifferently the <HI>Cover∣ings</HI>
upon Houses in <HI>London,</HI> since the Rebuild∣ing,
and cut a snip from the <HI>thickest</HI> and <HI>thin∣nest</HI>
part of the edge of any Sheet he can come
at, he will generally find <HI>Cast-Lead</HI> to be a
third, or at least a fourth part thicker, nay,
many times above twice as thick in some pla∣ces
as in others, and the Coverings for the
most part <HI>crackt, cockled</HI> and <HI>patcht</HI> with <HI>Sol∣der,</HI>
if they have not been new laid, as many
have been since the <HI>Fire,</HI> particularly the <HI>Roy∣al
Exchange</HI> and <HI>Cordwa∣ners-Hall</HI>
new covered four
or five Years ago;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Since the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>building of the City, and the first Notice of Mill'd Lead, the Plumbers to make their Cover∣ings seem cheaper, have generally cast much thinner than for∣merly, which hath pro∣duced these ill Effects in so short a time, tho in more ancient Cover∣ings the same Inequali∣ties and defects propor∣tionably may be seen.</NOTE> the
<HI>Kings Head,</HI> a Confecti∣oners
by <HI>Ludgate,</HI> part new
covered about seven Years
since, and the new as well
as the old crack'd, cock∣led,
and patcht with Sol∣der;
the <HI>Eagle</HI> and <HI>Child</HI>
in <HI>Tower-street,</HI> stript and
new laid in 1676. Mr.
<HI>Clark</HI>'s House, next the
<PB N="96" REF="137"/>
<HI>Bell</HI> in <HI>Fryday-street,</HI> and abundance more new
<HI>Covered,</HI> too long here to mention; and where
the old ones lye, this decay and patching gene∣rally
appears: Whereas such Coverings as
have been laid with <HI>Mill'd-Lead,</HI> some not a∣bove
6. <HI>l.</HI> to the Foot, ten or twelve Years
ago, lye as well as at first laying, and in all
probability will so continue many Years, as
to instance in a few: At Mr. <HI>Wdgstaffe</HI>'s, next
the Hand and Pen in <HI>Rood-Lane,</HI> a Covering
about 30 Foot square, with Sheets the full
length; Mr. <HI>Miners</HI>'s Buildings in the <HI>Inner Tem∣ple,</HI>
with Sheets 22 Foot long, where a Cover∣ing
of Cast-Lead by, at the same time laid,
being compared, the Defects complained of
will plainly appear, in <HI>this,</HI> while <HI>that</HI> conti∣nues
as well as at first, at Mr. <HI>Graydon</HI>'s House
in the <HI>Pell-mell,</HI> and divers others too long al∣so
here to mention; besides many more in
Town, and some great Houses in the Coun∣trey
done since, as Esq. <HI>Sanders</HI>'s at <HI>Tooting,</HI> some
Sheets 34 Foot long; Esq. <HI>Tilney</HI>'s new House
near <HI>Rotherwick</HI> in <HI>Bark-shire;</HI> Sir <HI>Iames Hayes</HI>'s
at <HI>Bedgbury,</HI> and Esq. <HI>Vane</HI>'s at <HI>Fairlaune</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI>
&amp;c. of different kinds, worth viewing for
Beauty and Imitation.</P>
<P>4. There are besides the <HI>Inequality,</HI> certain
defects in <HI>Cast-lead</HI> that lye concealed within
the Sheet, not appearing on the superficies,
called by the <HI>Plumber Blow-holes</HI> and <HI>Sand-holes,</HI>
which often happens in <HI>Casting,</HI> and must help
forward the decay of those <HI>Coverings,</HI> which
the <HI>Mill</HI> discovers, such <HI>Holes</HI> being enlarged
<PB N="97" REF="137"/>
as the <HI>Sheet</HI> lengthens in <HI>Milling,</HI> (and not clo∣sed
up as they falsely suggest) and where these
<HI>Holes</HI> or <HI>Breaks</HI> are met with, the Sheet is cut,
if long enough for use; if not, all's returned
again to be new Cast, so that none but <HI>sound
Sheets</HI> can pass the <HI>Mill</HI> twenty or thirty times,
as every Sheet does before it is finished.</P>
<P>5. Let us suppose then the present price of
<HI>Mill'd-Lead</HI> to be 16 <HI>s.</HI> a hund. and <HI>Cast-Lead 14 s.</HI>
which is an <HI>eighth part</HI> less, whatever the <HI>Ine∣quality</HI>
of a Cast-Sheet shall appear to be a∣bove
an <HI>eighth part,</HI> which is not easily discern∣ed,
so much must it be granted that <HI>Mill'd
Lead</HI> is cheaper; but if <HI>Mill'd Lead</HI> of 7 <HI>lib.</HI> to
the foot be admitted but to be as good as the
<HI>Plumbers</HI> pretended 9. <HI>l.</HI> it is cheaper at 16. <HI>s.</HI>
a hundred than his at 12 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI></P>
<P>6. Wherefore since 7 <HI>lib.</HI> to the foot may
very well be allowed, to remove all Objecti∣ons
at once which the Plumbers and their
Friends falsly charge the <HI>Mill'd-Lead</HI> with,
any Person (using the Plumber the Company
shall recommend or approve) that shall lay a
Covering with their Lead of 7 <HI>lib.</HI> to the
Foot square, they will undertake (and secure
him by good Covenants as Council shall advise)
to keep such Covering, not exceeding a 100 <HI>l.</HI>
value, in good and constant repair for a term
of 41 Years (to mention a time certain and
sufficient) for 5 <HI>s.</HI> a Year, and proportiona∣bly
for a greater; and if any Sheet or Sheets
shall crack, or any wise prove defective in re∣spect
of the Lead it self, they will be obliged
<PB N="98" REF="138"/>
at their own Charge (Carriage only paid for)
to lay new Sheets in their room, without that
patching and botching with Solder that ap∣pears
upon all the <HI>Cast-lead Coverings</HI> in Town,
that have not lain half so long, at a very great
Charge in <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Solder,</HI> besides the Da∣mage
the House must have sustained thereby.</P>
<P>☞ But because some <HI>Plumbers,</HI> and others
their Friends, do pretend greater Care and Improve∣ment
in their <HI>Casting</HI> of late, and have offered to
lay Wagers that they can Cast a <HI>Sheet</HI> of their full
length <HI>equal</HI> within <HI>one pound</HI> in ten quite
through; Mr. <HI>Hale,</HI> a Partner and Manager of
the Work, is ready to take any such Wager; nay,
he will give them a <HI>pound and an half</HI> in ten,
and lay them the price of a Fodder of Lead, that all
the Plumbers in Town, and their Friends joyned to
their assistance, in the way they have hitherto used
of <HI>Casting upon Sand,</HI> they cannot do't; and is
ready to enter into fair Articles with any one that
shall make the Wager; though if some should be
found so dexterous as to cast one or two such Sheets
perhaps in half a dozen, it would not mend the mat∣ter
for general use: Moreover, if this could be
done, even at the rate of a <HI>pound and an half</HI> in
ten, <HI>Mill'd-Lead</HI> is yet <HI>cheaper</HI> about Three <HI>per
Cent.</HI> For Ten bundaed weight of Cast lead would
cost 7. <HI>l.</HI> and Eight hundred and an half of Mill'd
Lead but 6 <HI>l.</HI> 16. s. As to the Plumbers pretence
of Casting <HI>broader,</HI> that's not yet (according to
the Proverb) as Broad as Long; for the <HI>Mill'd
Lead</HI> size of Three Foot and an half being broad
enough, and perhaps better than broader for gene∣ral
use, and they able to make their <HI>Sheets</HI> above
<PB N="99" REF="138"/>
<HI>twice as long</HI> as the <HI>Plumber</HI> can cast, if need
require, to save Drips, and comply with the
length of <HI>Coverings,</HI> this disadvantage is not
made good by any pretence of <HI>breadth</HI> soever;
which if greater breadths are necessary, as for <HI>Co∣peras-works,</HI> &amp;c. may be supplyed with <HI>Mill'd
Lead,</HI> by burning a Seam joyning two Sheets to∣gether.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mill'd Lead</HI> being to be had of any <HI>Thick∣ness,</HI>
even from one pound in the Foot to twenty, or
more if desired, must for the Reasons aforesaid be
<HI>cheaper</HI> and <HI>better</HI> than <HI>Cast Lead,</HI> and will
serve for all uses that <HI>Cast Sheets</HI> are fit for, and
the <HI>thinner</HI> sorts for many more, any one may be
supplyed with able Workmen to lay the same on
<HI>Churches</HI> or other <HI>Buildings,</HI> or work it into
<HI>Cisterns, Fountains, Pipes, Vessels for Brewers,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNderstanding that the Persons con∣cerned

out Printed Papers in Vindication
of the Service of the said Lead, and have also
lately made Proposals to your Honours to
serve their Majesty's therewith, or any pri∣vate
Persons for Covering of Houses, Gutters,
Pipes, Cisterns, Scuppers, Liquor-Backs, or

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<OPENER>May it please your Honours,</OPENER>
<P>THe Mill'd Lead is no ways so serviceable
and cheap as the same is represented,
nor indeed scarce fit for any service, as is evi∣dently
proved by daily experience in most
places where the same has been used; that af∣ter
<PB N="103" REF="140"/>
it hath lain a few Years, it hath crack'd,
flaw'd, and rose in ridges, so that the Persons
concerned, after having been at a considerable
Charge in the daily patching and mending of
it, have at last been forced to take it up, and
lay Cast-lead in the room of it, before such
time as the Houses or Places could be made
tight: of the truth of which, several Examples
can be given your Honours upon Oath, if re∣quired.</P>
<P>That on the other side, the Cast-Lead doth
plainly make appear its durance and service,
for in several old Buildings about this City
and <HI>Westminster,</HI> where this Lead hath been
laid for a great term of years, yet remaineth
as firm and right as when first laid: And be∣sides,
the same is cheaper and better to their
Majesty, or any private person, by 20 <HI>l. per
Cent.</HI> than the Mill'd-Lead is, according to
the Rates it is now sold, which together
with the strength and service is very consi∣derable.</P>
<P><HI>Also the Solder made and used by them of
the Mill'd Lead, is not fit for service, whereas
all Solder used by the Plumbers is by Essay
sealed according to the standing Rules of the

<P>By what is here offered, is humbly desired
may be taken by your Honours, as proceeding
from Duty, and not in prejudice to the Per∣sons
concerned in the Mill'd-Lead, for not∣withstanding
the plausible pretences of the use∣fulness

disparagement of the Cast-Lead, yet the

discredit the Mill'd-Lead, not for want of rea∣sons,
but being assured that a short time would

<P>I Have thought upon the Paper you shew∣ed
me, which you said the Plumbers pre∣sented
to the Navy-Board, complaining of
mighty defects in your Mill'd-Lead, and men∣tioning
a great many places where they say

their Confidence and Folly, to say such things
that may be so easily contradicted: I assure
you my Covering at <HI>Tooting</HI> lyes very well,
and I do not doubt but it will so continue;
indeed I am very proud of it, and I do not
think there's a finer and better Covering in
<HI>England,</HI> at least not of Cast-Lead, for I
have Sheets thereon about twice as long as
I ever heard the Plumber pretended to Cast,
being 34 Foot long, and I was very well sa∣tisfied
after a great deal of Discourse with
the Plumber before I began, that your Mill'd
Lead was cheaper in the whole Work, and
would prove much better, and being exactly
equal (which theirs is far from) would last
longer than theirs, and I see no cause yet to
alter my Opinion. Upon your request to
have something from me in Writing on this
Occasion, I could say no less, and suppose
this may suffice from</P>

<P>WHen I last saw you, you shewed me a
Paper addressed by the Plumbers to
the Navy-Board, wonderfully decrying your
Milld-Lead, commending their own, and be∣cause
that amongst several other places, which
they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay were covered with Mill'd-Lead, that
in a short time (being very defective) were
taken up, and new laid with Cast-Lead, they
mention mine in <HI>Essex-Buildings</HI> to have been
one; you then desired me to give two or
three lines in Writing of the truth thereof,
which I could not reasonably deny you; and
I do here assure you that the same Mill'd-Lead
which was first laid on about twelve
Years since upon two Platforms at my House
there, remains on still very well, free from
any such cracks or flaws and ridges they
complain of, which I have reason to believe
would not have continued so well, if they
had been covered with Cast-Lead; for that
the Cast-sheets which were laid upon the
Cornish next the Street before I came to the
House, were afterward in many places so
crack'd and cockled, that about eight Years
ago, as I remember, the Plumber took it up,
or great part of it, and new laid it again: I
considered also of the Charge of both wayes,
before I made use of the Mill'd-Lead, and was
<PB N="108" REF="143"/>
then satisfied that the whole was cheaper to
me, and would prove better than if I had
laid it with Cast-Lead of the size the Plumber
proposed, and I continue of the same mind
still; all which I thought fit to say upon this
occasion, and leave it to you to make use
thereof as you please, and am</P>

<P>YOu shewed me a Paper which the Plum∣bers
gave in to the Navy-Board, where∣in
they much complain of the defects of the
Mill'd-Lead (boasting of the excellency and
durableness of their Cast-Lead) and say, that
where the Mill'd-Lead has lain a few Years,
it hath so crack'd, flaw'd, and rose in ridges,
that after the Owners have been at great
Charge in the daily patching and mending of
it, they have at last been forced to take it
up, and lay Cast-Lead in its room: But I
doubt these Plumbers mistake the one for the
other, for I know very well their Cast-Lead
had all these ill qualities they complain of;
<PB N="110" REF="144"/>
for upon a House of mine, where Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>
now lives, next Door to the <HI>Bell</HI> in <HI>Fryday-street,</HI>
which was covered with Cast-Lead at
the first Building after the Fire: I do averr
that after such rising and cockling, and its
being patch'd almost all over, about eight
Years since the Tenant was forc'd to strip
it, and new lay it; and I well remember I
allowed 10 <HI>l.</HI> towards the charge, and I fear
in a few Years it will be in as bad a Condi∣tion
as ever, for it is already patch'd in di∣vers
places; and had I had the good Fortune
to have known time enough of your Mill'd-Lead,
I am very well satisfied from my own
Observation of such Places where I have since
known it laid, and the reason of the thing
it self, and the charge thereof (a Man
paying for no superfluous Lead, as in the
other you do) that I might have saved
Money, and have had a far better and more
durable Covering on my House than now I
have.</P>
<P><HI>SIR,</HI> I am so well satisfied of the excellen∣cy
of your Mill'd-Lead, and of the greatness
of its worth for all uses beyond Cast (which
is notwithstanding all the Care that can be
used in the Casting of it full of great uneven∣ness
and other defects) that I could say much
more than I have on this Subject, but I al∣ways
thought it a very impertinent thing to
spend too much time in arguing against Tran∣substantiation,
it being maintained by the im∣pudence
of a Party that resolve they will not
be convinc'd, and I take the only reason why
the Plumbers oppose your Mill'd-Lead to be
<PB N="111" REF="144"/>
this, because their Interest is concerned, and
I think they are as much in the right in so
doing as those Persons are in the wrong, that
make use of their Cast-Lead when the other
may be had.</P>

<HEAD>MEMORIAL,
Humbly offered by the Mill'd-Lead
Company, proving that their
Mill'd-Lead Scuppers are better
than Cast-Lead, and at least
25 per Cent. cheaper.</HEAD>
<P>THis Company having in <HI>Ianuary,</HI> 1678. made
a Proposal to this Board to make their Scup∣pers
of Mill'd-Lead, one Mr. <HI>Parsons</HI> a Plumber
they then usually employed, opposed it; pre∣tending,
that altho their Lead was not exactly
equal, yet the inequality was so inconsiderable,
that Mill'd-Lead Scuppers being then 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ in a
hundred more than theirs, they would be much
dearer to the King; whereupon the Board was
<PB N="115" REF="146"/>
pleased to appoint a time for hearing both
sides; when the Plumber to make his Pre∣tences
good, undertook his Scuppers should not
be above half a pound in ten heavier than the
size the Board should Order; they thereupon,
7 <HI>Ian.</HI> 1678. ordered each to make 36 Scup∣pers
of three several sizes and thicknesses, <HI>viz.</HI>
8 <HI>l. 10 l.</HI> and 12 <HI>l.</HI> to the Foot square; both
sides soon after sent in their Scuppers to <HI>Dept∣ford,</HI>
where being received into the Stores and
weighed, the Mill'd-Lead Scuppers appeared
to be conformable to the Order, and to weigh
but 8 <HI>c. 1 q. 26 l.</HI> whereas the Cast-Lead Scup∣pers
weighed 12 <HI>c. 3 q. 10 l.</HI> above one third
more; which appearing so gross a difference
from what the Plumber undertook, and he pre∣tending
Excuses and Servants carelesness:</P>
<P>The Board indulged him another Tryal up∣on
72 Scuppers, when he took to his Assist∣ance
one Mr. <HI>Whitehall,</HI> another Plumber that
usually also made Scuppers for the Navy, and
it cannot be imagined but that these Plum∣bers
now used all their Skill and Care, which
notwithstanding all, though in many places
they appeared to be thinner than the Milled-Lead
of the sizes given, the weight of the
whole 72 came to 25 <HI>c. 1 q. 12 l.</HI> whereof
<HI>Parsons</HI> made 31, weighing 9 <HI>c. 3 q. 0 l.</HI>
and <HI>Whitehall</HI> 41, weighing 15 <HI>c. 2 q. 12 l.</HI>
whereas the 72 Mill'd-Lead Scuppers weighed
but 16 <HI>c. 3 q. 10 l.</HI> about the same proportion
the former were, which at the then Prizes of
22 <HI>s.</HI> for the Cast, and 26 <HI>s. per hund.</HI> for the
Mill'd-Lead Scuppers, was 27 <HI>per Cent.</HI> loss to
the King; after which the Company made ma∣ny

more; however Demands have been dis∣continued
since. This being a matter of Fact,
the truth of which may appear from the Store∣keepers
Books at <HI>Deptford,</HI> this Company hopes
when you shall thus be put in mind of the
great and certain loss their Majesties have and
must sustain in this particular, demonstrated
by Tryals that have been so fairly and fully

the principal things and notions which are to
be considered in <HI>framing</HI> and <HI>fitting</HI> of a Ship
for the several uses unto which the same is
designed, in manner following.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<P>1. A Ship is understood to be all from the
<HI>Keel</HI> to the <HI>Vane,</HI> and from the extremity of
the <HI>Boulsprit</HI> to the <HI>Lanthorn.</HI></P>
<P>2. The said Ship is divided into <HI>Hull, Sails,</HI>
and her <HI>Burthen.</HI></P>
<P>3. The <HI>Hull</HI> is considered but as one piece
of Timber, and carved out of one Logg, and is di∣vided
into what is under the <HI>upper Deck,</HI> out of
which all waters is to be excluded. And what is
above the same, as <HI>Cabins, Round-house, Cud∣die,
Fore-castle, Coaches,</HI> &amp;c. which may be ra∣ther
esteemed as part of the burthen of a Ship,
than <HI>Essential part</HI> of the same.</P>
<P>4. The <HI>Hull</HI> under the said <HI>upper Deck</HI> is divi∣ded
into the <HI>Cavity</HI> or <HI>Hold,</HI> whether the same
shall be subdivided by other <HI>Decks</HI> and <HI>Bulk∣heads</HI>
or not, as also into the <HI>Shell</HI> of the said
<HI>Cavity:</HI> and thereby into the <HI>Additaments</HI> af∣fixed
to the outside of the said <HI>Shell.</HI> Such are
the <HI>false Stemm, Gripe, Keel, Stern-post,</HI> and <HI>Dead-rising</HI>
up the <HI>Tuck,</HI> excluding the <HI>Rudder.</HI></P>
<P>5. Upon the <HI>Shell</HI> of the Ship, or rather of
the said <HI>Cavity,</HI> there are to be considered the
several <HI>Lines</HI> under-mentioned, to be drawn <HI>par∣rallel</HI>
to the <HI>Keel,</HI> (viz.)</P>
<P>1. The <HI>line</HI> unto which the <HI>Hull</HI> of the Ship
sinks upon her <HI>launching.</HI></P>
<P>2. The <HI>line</HI> unto which the whole Ship <HI>sinks</HI>
when she is <HI>rigged, balasted,</HI> and fitted for the
<PB N="121" REF="149"/>
best advantage of sailing, and mann'd with a
sufficient Complement for that purpose, victu∣alled
with three months Victuals, and furnisht
with Defensive Arms.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>line</HI> unto which she sinks loaden as
a <HI>Merchant Man.</HI></P>
<P>4. The <HI>line</HI> unto which she <HI>stoops</HI> upon a
Wind of either side.</P>
<P>5. The <HI>line</HI> of <HI>Horizontal-section</HI> where the
<HI>Gun Deck,</HI> and all other Decks and Orlop
ought to be placed, and the <HI>lines</HI> to which the
<HI>Ports</HI> between each <HI>Deck</HI> ought to be made.</P>
<P>In the next place is to be considered the three
<HI>perpendicular length-way sections</HI> following, viz.</P>
<P>1. The section of splitting the whole Ship,
Cabbin, and all other superstructures included
between the <HI>Plank-sheering,</HI> and the <HI>Keels,</HI> the
upper line of which section is called the Sheer
of the Ship.</P>
<P>2. Upon the general and most comprehen∣sive
section I propound, that all the <HI>Horizon∣tal
lines</HI> before mentioned may be mark'd toge∣ther
with the <HI>bottom line</HI> of the Interval Cavi∣ty
or Hold before mentioned.</P>
<P>Lastly, let there be a <HI>transverse section</HI> of the
<HI>Hull</HI> at the <HI>main bend,</HI> within which let two o∣ther
<HI>parallel sections</HI> be described arising from
each extremity of the <HI>Keel.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the several <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Sections</HI> before
mentioned, it will be necessary to take Notice
of the <HI>Center of Gravity</HI> and <HI>Magnitude,</HI> as well
of the whole Ship comprehended between the
<HI>Keel</HI> and the <HI>Vane,</HI> as of the several parts there∣of,
<HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Centers</HI> of <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Magnitude</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="150"/>
of that part which is under the water; as also
of that which is above the water in the Air
and Wind.</P>
<P>2. The same also to be observed when the
Ship swims upon an <HI>uneven</HI> and <HI>unlevel Keel</HI>
drooping forwards, or sending aft.</P>
<P>3. Consideration is to be had of that <HI>line</HI>
which by a <HI>Spindle</HI> passing and fixed into the
Ground, the Ship lying cross a Current when
no Wind at all is stirring, would be in <HI>Equi∣librio;</HI>
also the like <HI>line</HI> passing through the su∣pernatant
part of the Ship would also be in
<HI>Equilibrio,</HI> its broad side lying to the Wind
in dead water.</P>
<P>In the next place there ought to be consi∣dered
the proportion between <HI>the way of the
Ship</HI> cut off at its greatest <HI>transverse section,</HI> and
<HI>the way of the same</HI> shaped from the same secti∣on
forward in the usual manner, or to his best
advantage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>BEing thus furnished with the sixteen sorts
of <HI>Experiments</HI> above mentioned, and with
the clear and definite understanding of the <HI>seve∣ral
parts</HI> of the Ship, and of all the several <HI>Se∣ctions,
Lines, Centers,</HI> and <HI>Proportions of resistance</HI>
above mentioned: We then proceed upon the
<PB N="123" REF="150"/>
third Branch of the first <HI>General Part</HI> as fol∣loweth.
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Suppose we have before us a
piece of <HI>Timber,</HI> of equal substance, of an in∣definite
length, and square at both ends, we are
now to consider by what process to carve out
of the same the <HI>Hull</HI> of a Ship, which work will
contain the several Considerations following.</P>
<P>(1.) Of what <HI>length</HI> to cut the said <HI>Timber,</HI>
which at first we will suppose to be the <HI>length</HI>
of <HI>four sides</HI> of the square, intending hereafter
to debate whether the same ought at all to be
<HI>longer</HI> or <HI>shorter,</HI> and in what Cases.</P>
<P>(2.) Suppose the said <HI>Square</HI> be divided in∣to
<HI>twelve parts,</HI> and that seven of them shall
be under water when the Ship is loaden.</P>
<P>(3.) Dividing the <HI>length line</HI> into twelve <HI>parts,</HI>
and at three of them let the two <HI>sides</HI> converge
into an <HI>Angle,</HI> whose sides let be <HI>portions of Cir∣cles</HI>
unto which the remaining strait part may
be a <HI>contingent line,</HI> which Angle is the first
means of facilitating the <HI>Ships way</HI> through
the Water.</P>
<P>(4.) At four parts let the <HI>bottom superficies</HI>
converge into an Angle, with the <HI>Horizontal
Section</HI> above mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> at the Ships
greatest draught of water.</P>
<P>(5.) At the said Section let the sides <HI>down∣wards</HI>
converge into an Angle, consisting also
of <HI>Circular Lines.</HI> This last Angle is made for
the Ships <HI>ease of falling</HI> into the Sea, as the two
first were for its <HI>easier passing</HI> through it.</P>
<P>In the next place we must provide for the
coming of water to the Rudder, which is to
be performed by two other Angulations, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="151"/>
from fifteen <HI>parts aft,</HI> let the sides of the Ship
converge into an Angle from the <HI>Horizontal
saction downwards,</HI> where the Ship draweth
least water at her Launching, which will be
the <HI>height of the Tuck,</HI> let the <HI>bottom superficies</HI>
be bent in a <HI>Circular line.</HI> And thus we have
in gross set down the <HI>five Incurvations</HI> of the
bottom and sides of our Logg, and how the
<HI>butt-ends</HI> thereof have been as it were abolish∣ed
<HI>forward on</HI> for the <HI>easie passage</HI> of the Vessel
through the water, and aft for the quick and
effectual pulse of the water upon the <HI>Rudder.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place we come to the like sha∣ping
of the remaining part of the <HI>Logg,</HI> which
we intend shall swim above the water, which
is performed as followeth.</P>
<P>Let it be supposed that the Ship upon a
Wind, is to stoop upon a certain Angle, let
the supernatant sides of a Ship so much <HI>tumble</HI>
(as they call it) as that the said <HI>sides</HI> may
remain <HI>perpendicular</HI> when the Ship <HI>stoops,</HI> which
being done quite round the upper surface, the
remainder will be the <HI>shape</HI> and <HI>section</HI> of the
<HI>upper Deck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Memorandum,</HI> That all the forementioned In∣curvations
are to be trimmed and repaired by
reconciled lines.</P>
<P>In the next place we come to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollowing</HI> or
<HI>excavating</HI> of our <HI>Logg,</HI> which suppose (be∣ginning
at the <HI>middle</HI>) we do (leaving equal
thickness) every where until the <HI>Logg</HI> become
so light that it swims at the line representing
the <HI>launching line,</HI> and consequently we have
now acquired the <HI>model of a Ship</HI> as it appear∣eth
in her launching, except the Cabbins and
<PB N="125" REF="151"/>
what is usually superstructed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the upper Deck.</P>
<P>In the next place we are to consider how far <HI>ballast</HI> and
<HI>weight of rigging,</HI> &amp;c. will sink the said Ship: And second∣ly,
how much <HI>deep</HI> the weight that must be added to fit
out a <HI>Man of War</HI> will depress her, for till then we can∣not
rationally determine the place of the <HI>Gun-deck,</HI> where∣fore
the next enquiry must be, what <HI>extent of Sail</HI> our Vessel
must carry, and consequently the <HI>length of the Masts</HI> and
<HI>Yards,</HI> and then of their <HI>thickness</HI> and <HI>weight;</HI> and from thence
the size of the <HI>rigging,</HI> and from thence the <HI>Wind-loft,</HI> and
from thence the <HI>Cables</HI> and <HI>Anohors,</HI> and from thence all the
<HI>Capsterns</HI> and <HI>Windless Boats, Bitts, Catheads</HI> and <HI>Davits.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place we are to consider the <HI>quality, quantity</HI>
and <HI>weight</HI> of our <HI>ballast,</HI> so as the Ship may stoop but ac∣cording
to our intention, and according to the <HI>strength</HI> of
our <HI>Masts</HI> and <HI>Shrowds.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus found out our second Water-line, which
I call the <HI>sailing-line,</HI> as the <HI>first</HI> was called the <HI>launching-line:</HI>
Now we come to the <HI>third</HI> which is the <HI>line of War.</HI>
And this is to be discovered by computing the <HI>weight</HI>
first of the <HI>Ordnance,</HI> which suppose to be in a Man of
War, one 6<HI>th.</HI> part of what is between the <HI>Sailing-line,</HI>
and the <HI>line of Burthen,</HI> or <HI>fourth Line.</HI> Secondly, the <HI>weight</HI>
of <HI>Men</HI> with three <HI>months Victuals;</HI> in order thereunto we
must determine the number of Men for <HI>sailing</HI> from the
<HI>Spread of Canvas,</HI> and the number of Men for <HI>fighting</HI> from
the <HI>Amplitude</HI> of the <HI>Deck,</HI> and <HI>weight</HI> of the <HI>Ordnance.</HI></P>
<P>Having found out the said Line, and considered the
<HI>distance</HI> of <HI>Trunnions</HI> of the <HI>Guns</HI> from the <HI>Gun-deck,</HI> and
the distance of the <HI>Muzzels</HI> of the <HI>Guns</HI> levelled from the
surface of the water, we come at length to determine the
place of the <HI>Gun-deck,</HI> and consequently of the other <HI>Deck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Memorandum,</HI> That the <HI>superstructions</HI> upon the upper
Deck are not only for the <HI>Accommodation</HI> of Men, but also
<HI>fortifications</HI> of the Ship; forasmuch as the Guns in the
<PB N="126" REF="152"/>
<HI>Fore-castle</HI> and <HI>steerage</HI> clear the <HI>Deck,</HI> as those of the <HI>Round
house</HI> do the <HI>Quarter deck.</HI></P>
<P>Having found the <HI>dimensions</HI> of the Masts, we next come
to the <HI>place</HI> of them, <HI>viz.</HI> by what points of the Gun-deck
they must pass, and here we must consider the reasons of
their <HI>raking ast,</HI> as also of the <HI>steeving</HI> of the <HI>Boulsprit,</HI>
and withal the reasons of placing the <HI>Top-mast</HI> before or
behind the <HI>Main-mast,</HI> and of dividing each Mast into three
parts, and the <HI>proportion</HI> of the <HI>round Tops, main Stays, the
place</HI> and <HI>fitting</HI> of the <HI>Shrowd</HI> so as to make way for
the <HI>gibbing</HI> of the <HI>Yards,</HI> and setting of the Shrowds <HI>loose</HI> or

<P>WE have hitherto supposed the <HI>Ship</HI> to be exactly
