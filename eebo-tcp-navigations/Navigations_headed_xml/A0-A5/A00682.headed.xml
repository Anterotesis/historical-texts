<HEAD>THE MANNER OF the Solemnities at the Election and Coronation of <HI>Fardinand</HI> the Em∣perour, in <HI>Francford August</HI> 30. 1619. With other occurrences in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and diuers <HI>parts of Germany for three moneths last past.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Earle of <HI>Thorne</HI> (after hee had renewed his coue∣nant with the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> and dispatched his affaires in <HI>Mo∣rauia,</HI> according to his harts desire) remoued his Campe from thence, and passed into the lower <HI>Austria,</HI> and inter∣cepting some certaine places and townes by the way, laid siege against <HI>Laba,</HI> which refused to giue him admittance because it was fortified with a ga∣rison.</P>
<P>The Protestant States, seeing that they could not hitherto make any full agreement with the Romish Catholiques, and that they had spent all the time
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>in vaine, sent their embassadours vnto him, to de∣mand of him what reason hee had to enter that country with so great an army: and to request him, that, seeng they had done nothing which might offend the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> hee would lead away his Forces from thence againe. For the reason why hitherto they had returned no answer to the Let∣ters which were sent from the <HI>Bohemians</HI> the fifth of March, was, because that the Romish Catho∣lique States, day by day, deferred to giue their Ca∣tegoricall and resolute answer to the principall ar∣ticles and clauses of those Letters; and yet not∣withstanding had alwayes made fayre shew of a friendly agreement and peaceable end. Howeuer, albeit they saw that their hope hereof was fru∣strate, yet they were not against the much-desired League, but were rather glad of it: and the rather, for that they called to minde, how that the Empe∣rour <HI>Matthias</HI> answered the States at <HI>Budwitz</HI> in the yeare 1614. that they should send their Legates or Embassadors to the Parliament which was to be holden at <HI>Prage</HI> in the yeare 1615. and then and there should enter a Treaty concerning the re∣newing of that League. Wherefore they gaue li∣cence and authoritie to their Deputies or Legates, to renew that League; prouided, that it were not repugnant to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and the States and Religion of the Romish Catholiques. This Embassie by fiue selected and chosen out of euery State, was performed.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>A while after there came to the Camp, certaine Embassadours of the Romish catholike States, and Earle <HI>Buchem</HI> being their Spokesman, they say that they neuer did any thing that might aggrieue ey∣ther the Earle of <HI>Thorne,</HI> or any others of the <HI>Bo∣hemians:</HI> and that they did very carefully maintaine and preserue peace. Wherefore they request that he would be pleased to spare them, and to dislodge his Campe from before <HI>Laba.</HI></P>
<P>As touching the Confederation and League betwixt the Protestants and them; It was true in∣deed, that the Protestant States and they had not yet drawne to a full conclusion in all things; yet, forasmuch as the points of difference betwixt them were but small, they were in good hope that very shortly a good end and agreement should be made betwixt them.</P>
<P><HI>Thorne</HI> making answer, said vnto them; That the <HI>Bohemians</HI> by maine necessity were constrained to doe what they did: and for his part, That he would not willingly vndertake any thing against any man without cause: but his desire was, to pur∣sue all hostile Forces, and to driue away the ene∣my though hee were at <HI>Hierusalem:</HI> That hee came into that Prouince to preserue peace and tranquili∣tie, and to relieue and ayd the oppressed; for hee would faine haue it so, that hereafter the Prote∣stants and Romish Catholiques should walke toge∣ther hand in hand as equals one to another in eue∣ry respect. That heretofore the Romish Catho∣liques
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>haue had the superiority and preheminence, but against good reason; for the Protestants were as honest men as the Romish Catholiques, and therefore hee would no longer suffer that these be∣ing kept vnder and oppressed, the Romish Catho∣liques (like oyle in water) should swimme aloft: for he would haue an equalitie kept amongst them, without any respect had to one Religion or other; and looke what priuiledges were granted to the one side, the same should be permitted to the o∣ther, that so a constant and perpetuall peace be∣twixt them might be made: And that whosoeuer should be their King and Prince, hee might be safe from the treacheries and commotions of the <HI>Clese∣lians,</HI> &amp; so might gouerne the weale publique with greater quietnesse and honour. For his owne part, hee tooke no care whence or from whom he should receiue prouision, mony or aid to maintaine his ar∣my. He had resigned himselfe vp to God, and made prayers to him, that he would further and prosper this his honest and truly Christian purpose, and grant vnto him power and strength fitting and ne∣cessary for him. That he tels them the truth, That he would neuer haue made any attempt against <HI>La∣ba,</HI> but that he found it fortified with a Garison, and that they themselues were the causes why hee did besiege it. For hee had giuen notice to Earle <HI>Traustam,</HI> that when hee found no Garison, nor any resistance, there the people should not need to feare any danger by his comming.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>When the Legates had heard him speake thus, they made answer, that they would deale with <HI>Fer∣dinand,</HI> &amp; do their best endeauours, that both <HI>Laba</HI> and other places in that Prouince might bee quit and cleared of Souldiers.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>Thorne</HI> gaue his word that on condi∣tion, that Garison might be remoued, the gates of the Citie set open, and hereafter the Citie fenced with a Garison of Protestants, and not with ene∣mies, hee would not attempt any thing further against that place: and so he dismissed them.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Lords directors held a con∣sultation, that if a treaty of peace were to be made, vpon what condition it were to be entertained: and they concluded &amp; decreed it altogether necessary.</P>
<P N="1">1 That all Protestants whatsoeuer (as well States as inferiours) throughout the whole Kingdome, whether they dwelt vnder a Romish catholike or an Euangelicall Magistrate, by vertue of a charter granted vnto them by the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus,</HI> in point of Religion; (it being mutually couenanted on both sides) should enioy the benefite of the se∣cretest consultations in the Parliament, and Imperi∣all confirmations, and it should be lawfull for them as well as for the <HI>Silesians</HI> &amp; others in other places to erect and set vp Schooles; all such acts, decrees, prouiso's, made heretofore to the contrary, either by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> or by them that are <HI>Sub vnâ,</HI> being declared to be voyd and of none effect.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P N="2">2 That the Proscription and the banishing of the Iesuits out of the Kingdome, should be ratified and made sure and firme for euer: so that it shall neuer be lawfull for them to returne into that king∣dome vnder pretence of any order whatsoeuer. That their Colledges and all their goods should be confiscate and adiudged to the publique good of the States, and that their priuiledges should be razed out of publique Records.</P>
<P N="3">3 That their Confederations and Leagues made with the people of <HI>Hungaria, Austria, Mo∣rauia,</HI> and of both the <HI>Lusatia's</HI> should bee ratified and confirmed.</P>
<P N="4">4 That the Matter of Defence should be defer∣red till the generall Assembly of those Prouinces.</P>
<P N="5">5 That it should be lawfull to ordaine and ap∣poynt Assemblies of States in diuers Territories, after the ancient manner.</P>
<P N="6">6 That the hereditary Leagues with the Ele∣ctors and other neighbour Princes, should bee re∣newed.</P>
<P N="7">7 That the Banishing and proscription of cer∣taine men out of the Kingdome, the remouing of them from the publique Offices, should bee con∣stant and firme.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<P>To these seuen articles, the Directors after∣wards added diuers others which they thought needfull for the Kingdome and the prouinces: as namely,</P>
<P N="1">1 That, that decree where the deceased Empe∣rour did giue to the bishop of <HI>Prage Ius patronatus,</HI> the aduowson and patronage, to present Priests to all Churches, is repugnant to his Maiesties Char∣ter; and therefore let it be abrogated, and let the power be giuen to the consistory of <HI>Prage</HI> to confer those benefices vpon such Pastors as are addicted to that religion, which is principally professed in that Parish.</P>
<P N="2">2 Seeing that the Subiects dwelling not only in the Emperours dominions, but also in other spiri∣tuall or secular iurisdictions, (both parties being agreed) by the Emperours charter, had had pow∣er and authority hitherto to erect Churches and Schooles, let them still retaine and keepe the same hereafter, and let thest <HI>Clostergrabiens,</HI> whose tem∣ple was demolished by the Bishop, make vse of some other temple in the City, vntill their owne be reedified.</P>
<P N="3">3 Let the <HI>Burnauiens</HI> hereafter quietly and pea∣cibly possesse their owne Church.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Churches in the City of <HI>Prage</HI> (which
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>haue beene built since his Maiesties Charter was obtained) as namely the Church of the holy Trini∣ty, in the lesser towne; and the Churches of our Sauiour, and of <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Iude,</HI> with the Chappell adioining to it, in the old towne, let them for euer be left in the power of them which are <HI>Sub vtrâ{que},</HI> and by whom they were built: and the next Parlia∣ment let them be registred in the publike recordes.</P>
<P N="5">5 Forasmuch as the vniuersity of <HI>Prage</HI> and all the goods appertaining vnto it, were giuen by the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus</HI> to the States <HI>Sub vtrâ{que}.</HI> Therfore let them still haue power either to bestow some thing of their owne, or to exact of their Sub∣iects any thing whereby that vniuersity and other Churches may be sustained, and that which is so collected, let it be kept vpon record, and required of the defenders as well as other publike contribu∣tions of the Subiects.</P>
<P N="6">6 Let not any other spirituall orders besides those which are in the kingdome already, be brought in either by the King, or by those which are <HI>Sub vnâ.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7 Let not the Commissaries which are wont to be sent to the Parliament by the King: let them not dwell too long vpon the Kings proposition, but speedily require an answer from the States.</P>
<P N="8">8 Let the States in the Parliament conferre their
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>voyces together; and after they haue collected their voyces, let them giue vp their answers by one either seuerally or generally: neither let the Kings Councellers sunder and separate themselues from the States, but let them also giue their best coun∣sell and aduice for the common good.</P>
<P N="9">9 Let it not be lawfull to except against the an∣swer of the States in Parliaments: neither let the States be bound to admit any reply, or to accept any other conclusion, if perhaps after their depar∣ture any such conclusion be made of any.</P>
<P N="10">10 And let not the Parliament be continued a∣boue 14. dayes, vnlesse it be by a peculiar consent of the States.</P>
<P N="11">11 When the chiefe Chancelor of the King∣domes propoundeth any thing to the King, let an∣other Chancelor be present, and haue notice giuen him of the same.</P>
<P N="12">12 Such as are to be Secretaries and Clarkes of the Chancery, let them be honest men, and addic∣ted to the Religion <HI>Sub vtrâ{que},</HI> after the vsuall and accustomed manner in former times.</P>
<P N="13">13 In the next Parliament, let there be a consul∣tation held, about renewing the Hereditary leagues with the Electors and other neighbour countries.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<P N="14">14 That which hath been already concluded, in the last assembly, concerning some perfidious per∣sons, whereof some were to be banished the coun∣try, and some to be barred from publike offices: let it remaine firme and ratified.</P>
<P N="15">15 Hereafter let none of the Kings Lieutenants in the townes of <HI>Prage</HI> be susteyned or maintained, neither let the Kings Iudges haue place either in the townes of <HI>Prage,</HI> or in any others.</P>
<P N="16">16 And seeing that by commandement of the States, the Directors and exactors of contributi∣ons haue runne into a great deale of debt, in defend∣ing and preseruing the Kingdome from the enemy, and in paying the Souldiers their stipends (the Directors in the meane while being wise enough to saue themselues harmlesse) Therefore let the goods of such as were causes of that war (whether they be fled out of the Kingdome, or still remaine in it) be confiscated, and adiudged to the paiment of those debts.</P>
<P N="17">17 In like manner, let the Kings goods be sold (alwayes excepting those goods of the King which are inserted into publique records, and can neuer be alienated) Let the Kings goods be sould seeing they were redeemed with other mens mony, and that many therefore were constrained to en∣gage their faith and credit: and let the mony which
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>is collected thence be imployed to the payment of the Kings debts, and towards the repayring of their dammages and losses, whose Houses and goods were pillag'd and burnt vp by the Kings Souldiers.</P>
<P N="18">18 Such Church goods as vpon the vrgency of extreame necessity, haue beene laid to pawne or sold outright, let them not be redeemed at all; but let more of them be sold away, yet with this cauti∣on, that prouision be made that the spirituall per∣sons may be honestly maintained.</P>
<P N="19">19 Let not the chamber of <HI>Bohemia</HI> be subiect to the Kings chamber, nor doe seruice to it in further∣ing the decrees thereof.</P>
<P N="20">20 Let the walles be reedified about the townes of <HI>Prage,</HI> and let all forraigne Ecclesiasticall lawes be subiect to their iurisdiction.</P>
<P N="21">21 The <HI>Prage</HI> townes and other townes which haue a third free state, let them not hereafter be called any more by the royall name of Chamber goods, as heretofore in publique records, (wee know no reason why) they were stiled and enti∣tuled.</P>
<P N="22">22 What shall be done concerning those two Cities in the Kingdome of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> namely <HI>Pilsna</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>and <HI>Budwitz,</HI> let it be consulted vpon.</P>
<P N="23">23 Touching money which shall accrew by bu∣rials, let the halfe of it be imployed vpon the re∣pairing the wals of the City, and vpon the <HI>Prage</HI> Townes.</P>
<P><HI>Pilsna, Budwitz,</HI> and <HI>Gretsna,</HI> let them be giuen to the State <HI>ab vtra{que},</HI> that in them they may pro∣uide sufficient Armories, without which our bu∣sinesse of Defence cannot come to any good.</P>
<P N="24">24 But to whose trust these Armories are to be committed, and what costs and charges are need∣full for prouiding and storing vp armes therein, let consultation be had hereafter.</P>
<P>At this time there was a Parliament holden at <HI>Vratislavia</HI> by the Princes and the States of <HI>Si∣lesia:</HI> The King sent to it one <HI>Otto Melander</HI> a noble Heroicall Gentleman, and one of his Councell: who from the Prince of <HI>Lignitz,</HI> in the name of the rest of the Princes and States, brought backe this answere, <HI>viz:</HI></P>
<P>They say, that by relation of the Noble and Honourable Parsonage <HI>Otto Melander,</HI> and al∣so by his Maiesties Royall Letters, which hee deliuered vnto them, they were giuen to vnder∣stand, that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> hath determined, since the Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> is now deceased, to vnder∣take the gouernment of the Kingdome, and to
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>confirme vnto these Princes and Countries, all lawes, rights, and priuiledges, as well gene∣rall as speciall, all Grants and Customes, euen the <HI>Maiestatis Diploma,</HI> the Charters of State, which were granted by his Predecessours, the Kings of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> by <HI>Ferdinand, Maximilian, Rodolphus</HI> and <HI>Matthias:</HI> and that hee is deter∣mined not onely to confirme whatsoeuer hath beene granted by his Predecessors, but also to send his Confirmation vnto them: or if at this time it be full of danger to send such Confirma∣tions, yet at least hee will accept whatsoeuer spe∣ciall priuiledges any of the Prouinces can shew for themselues. That looke what dissentions and disagreements there be betwixt the Romish Ca∣tholiques and Protestants, he is purposed to com∣pound them.</P>
<P>That hee would in these places confirme the Office of the King, and accept from him the Oath of Allegiance: and did hope that by this meanes it would come to passe, that (seeing hee promised moreouer to take vpon him, and to dis∣charge the Emperours debts which hee owed in the Prouinces of <HI>Silesia</HI>) the States of <HI>Silesia</HI> would not onely pay such Contributions as they had formerly promised, but also would performe all other duties and offices which were due vnto him: That in so doing hee himselfe also might haue cause to declare and shew his fatherly loue and affection vnto them still more and more:
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>And that also, the States of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> to whom in like manner he had already sent the Confirma∣tion of their Priuiledges, might thereby take occasion to settle themselues to due obedience, that so all troubles being composed, and warres ended, the Kingdome might enioy her former peace and tranquilitie.</P>
<P>But as heretofore it gaue them great content∣ment, that the Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> was pleased to deuise a way how his Kingdomes and Countries might be prouided of one to be their head, and to succeed him after his death; and that so all occa∣sions of warres and seditions being cut off, peace and tranquility might be preserued and continued in the Kingdome: So also they called to minde, when that Succession was giuen to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> vp∣on what conditions they accepted it, and what promises they receiued from him; and what they on the other side were bound to performe vnto him: and so they wish with all their hearts, that <HI>Matthias</HI> his departure had hapned at such time, as all things being in peace, they might quietly vse and enioy their piuiledges and immunities, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> might obtaine the wished end of his Succession with greatest facilitie: for so nothing could haue hindered them, but that vpon the re∣ceipt of the Letters of Confirmation of their ge∣nerall and speciall priuiledges, they had forthwith accepted him for their King, and had performed vnto him all such offices as were due.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
<P>But howsoeuer it be, they are exceeding glad, that he remembring his promise made vnto them, is desirous to put it in execution. But they doubt not, but that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> will set before his eyes, how lamentable and confused the state of those Countries is; and that the combustion is now spread so farre, and growne so vehement, that it cannot without great difficultie and danger be ex∣tinguished and suppressed: and that hee will be pleased to take into his consideration, how farre these times are altered from those wherein his suc∣cession to the Kingdome of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was made:</P>
<P>As namely, that now the publique peace and quiet is disturbed, all the Country embroyled with warres, their Townes sacked and spoyled, and euery place fraught with Soldiers and armed men. That their priuiledges confirmed heretofore, are of no power or strength to defend them from these euils. And that not onely Disputations and diuers wrested interpretations haue beene inuented to discredit that profitable businesse of Defence, vn∣dertaken for the profit and good of all; but also, that warres are prepared, and great violence done to the Subiect: so that it seemeth that the bare con∣firmation of Priuiledges is not now any longer sufficient to establish peace in that Kingdome and those Provinces, but it is necessary that what be∣fore was promised in words, be now shewed in deed and action.</P>
<P>Also they doubt not, but that he will be pleased
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>to remember what a quiet, sweet and calme state there was thorow the whole kingdome of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the other confederate countries, not onely in the dayes of former Kings, his Predecessors; but euen at that very time when he was admitted to the succession in the same kingdome: and how farre it is estranged from that tranquility: how much it concerneth the common wealth, that the ancient and wholesome ordinances of the kingdome, and the old custome be obserued, not onely about the designation, but also about the acceptation of the King, whosoeuer he shall bee.</P>
<P>All which things being duly considered; The King and all others may easily perceiue, that, al∣though they in times past did elect and designe him to bee their chiefe Soueraigne Duke, and that of their owne free will and pleasure, without any eye or regard to the Kingdome of <HI>Bohemia:</HI> yet, the case with the Kingdom and other prouinces stand∣ing so as it doth; they may not to the great preiu∣dice of others, (as well concerning the execution of the designation, as concerning the designation it selfe) accept and admit him to be their gouer∣nour.</P>
<P>Also that the King by the premises may easily coniecture, that these embroilements and combus∣tions, together with the troubles and hurts which followed thereupon in point of religion through∣out <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Silesia,</HI> cannot be remedied and laid asleepe, by the bare charter of confirmation of
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>priuiledges: but that these times desire to see the effect of this confirmation, and doe require deedes and not words.</P>
<P>These things considered, they hope, and beseech his maiesty, that he would be pleased not to take it in ill part; that, weighing the great danger of these times, they thinke it good for them to expect, vntill he doe not onely vndertake the gouernment and administration of the kingdome of <HI>Bohemia:</HI> but also, stinting all these troubles, doe settle the whole kingdome in that state which their priuiledges doe require, and that they may freely without warre and molestation, enioy their priuiledges confirmed. And that this may be done very well, if (all warres being ended) he would <HI>ipso facto</HI> performe all things to the Prouinces according to the prescript of their priuiledges in point of Religion, and would take order for them by granting such a charter, that by it they might enioy the peace of Religion. To the performance hereof, he needed not any inter∣position; for here was nothing required but the very effect of their priuiledges; and that is the one∣ly meanes both to settle peace and tranquility on all sides, and also to keepe and retaine it constantly: which being vsed, when he should enter vpon the administration of the kingdome, he needed not to make any question at all, but they in their place will doe what necessity requireth.</P>
<P>Concerning the Earle of <HI>Thorne</HI> his expedition and voyage into the lower <HI>Austria,</HI> we haue spoken

The Romish Catholiques euen vntill then were in deliberating what answer they should giue to the Protestants: For the Protestants had pro∣pounded seuen articles to them to consult vpon: namely, that all the R. catholike States in the vpper &amp; lower <HI>Austria</HI> should be one body with the Pro∣testants in those parts; that in time of vrgent neces∣sity the one side should defend the other: that their priuiledges (as well old as new) should remaine whole and entyre to euery state, and nothing in them, should be altered and changed. In burialls and spittles for sicke folke there should be no difference made between Protestants &amp; R. Catholiques: but that without respect of religion both alike should receiue the like benefite by them. That to the vniuersity of <HI>Vienna</HI> (which the states by com∣mon consent, founded in the yeare 1613) learned men should be called without respect of what Religion they be, viz. Romish Catholique or Pro∣testant. That no man should be troubled for diffe∣rence in religion. That both sides should abstaine from persecuting one another, and that euery man should be permitted to enioy his owne liberty.</P>
<P>And howsoeuer as yet, they could not agree v∣pon the foresaid articles, yet, because the earle of <HI>Thorne</HI> desired it, they remoued the garison from the city of <HI>Laba:</HI> which being done, <HI>Thorne</HI> placed there a garison of his souldiers; vntill such time as the States had leuied an army, and prouided a ga∣rison for that City.</P>

<P N="1">1 That the Confederation begun of late, and confirmed by a solemne Oath betweene the <HI>Bohe∣mians, Morauians, Silesians,</HI> and <HI>Lusatians,</HI> should be ratified, and all the branches thereof should be kept inuiolably to all succeeding Gene∣rations.</P>

<P N="3">3 It was decreed likewise that the Edict touching such as were proscribed for their bad and treche∣rous gouernment should be banished the country for euer, and their goods to be ceized to the vse of the towne where they dwelt, and to that purpose to be sold to the best aduantage, made by the States

<P N="5">5 That there should be a diligent search made of Armes laid vp in any houses, Monasteries, Nun∣neries situate as well within the City, as without, and that those Armes, together with all gold, siluer and moneyes found in the hand of any Ecclesiasti∣call person to be taken from them, and to be trans∣lated with the publique good: and that all Citizens and subiects of the Romish Catholique Religion, together with all partakers of the Roman faction; should be laid hold on, and their houses being care∣fully searched, all Armes should be taken from them, and be conueied to a certaine place appoin∣ted

The Consecrator turned himselfe to the Electors, Ambassadors, and all the people standing round about, demaunded of them, whe∣ther they would submit themselues to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> establish his kingdome, and performe odedience to his commandements: when they had testified their consents to all those motions, and cryed with a loud voice, <HI>That he ought to be their King;</HI> hee was vnclothed in certaine places of his body, and then the Consecrator came to him, and taking oyle annointed the Crowne of his head, his neck, his breasts, his right arme and his hands, adding these words at each seuerall part hee annointed; <HI>I annoint thee with holy oyle, in the name of the Fa∣ther, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost.</HI></P>

The lesser moneys had the letter F. with a crowne, and the number of 11. stamped on them on the one side; on the other a Crowne, and these words: CROWNED KING OF THE ROMANS, SEP∣TEMBER IX. MDCXIX.</P>
<P>The casting of this money made such a hurly burly among the Common-people, that the Chap∣laines could scarce make way for the greatnesse of the presse, though they were on horsebacke: the cloth on the bridge as soone as the Emperor passed, was cut, torne and rent in peeces by the people.</P>
<P>In the Pallace or Hall of the Court, the Tables were set and royally furnished for himselfe and the Princes Electors: the Tables of the three Tem∣porall Electors were couered with red Veluet as also the Table of the Elector of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> but no meate was set vpon them, as is prouided by the constitution of the golden Bull: being thus at last in the Pallace, the Delegates of the Secular Ele∣ctors addressed them to performe the Offices of the Electorship, in stead of their Lords and Princes
<PB N="41" REF="22"/>themselues. When <HI>Pappenhemius</HI> the heredi∣tary Marshall of the Empire mounted his horse, and being brought with a measure of siluer, to a heape of oates, being laid together in the open yard, before the Court, betweene the Well of wine and the Kitchin, filled his measure, and strucke it with a rod of siluer, and then gaue it to a Seruant to keepe, the people after snatching them away.</P>
<P>After him appeared one of the Delegates of the <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> riding also on horse-backe from the Court, and tooke vp a Basen of siluer with an Ewer of gold, and a Towell, set vpon a Board by the Kitchin where the Bull was roa∣sted, and carryed it with him to the Court.</P>
<P>Last of all, the Delegate of the Elector <HI>Pala∣tine,</HI> Sewer hereditary to the Kingdome, being brought foorth from the Court, tooke certaine dishes of the Bull roasted in the publique Kit∣chin, couered with foure siluer platters, and set out on the Dresser, and bore them with him to the Court.</P>
<P>This being done, the rude multitude breaking into the Kitchin, by maine force carryed away with them the Bull which was roasted whole, with the head, feet, hoofes, tayle and hornes, and stuft full of Hares, Conies, Lambes, Geese, and diuers other sorts of Birds and fowles, pulling it by peece-meale, and cutting it a sunder with
<PB N="42" REF="23"/>their kniues: and which is more rude, they defa∣ced the Kitchin, and tooke away all the Tim∣ber of it.</P>
<P>While they kept this coyle, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and the Electors are euery one at their owne Tables. The Well before the Court, made in the manner of a rocke, beganne to flow with redde and white wine, out of the mouth of an Eagle with two heads crowned, which was placed betweene two Lyons bearing the Ornaments of the Empire, the Scepter, the Globe and Sword.</P>
<P>Now the wine ranne out of this Eagle in great abundance for three houres together, being re∣ceiued into two vessels of exceeding great quan∣titie, as many as would hauing liberty to draw and drinke of it as much as they would, till at last, by the rage of the giddy multitude, they in vaine striuing against them who were appoin∣ted to keepe it, the Well was borne downe, and the Eagle, with the Lions, and all other Orna∣ments of it were caryed away.</P>
<P>The Royall Dinner continued till fiue of the clocke in the after-noone with great solemnitie and ioy. The Emperour at last departed from that Court to his owne Royall Palace, the Ele∣ctors accompanying him some few dayes after. There were publique Tiltings for ioy of this Co∣ronation.</P>
<P>After it the Ambassadours of the <HI>Palatine</HI> and
<PB N="43" REF="23"/><HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and last of all, of the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> returned home to their seuerall Princes, many wishing all prosperitie and good successe to the Emperour, and expressing their prayers for him in Verse.</P>
