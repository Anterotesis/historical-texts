<HEAD><HI>An</HI> ACT <HI>of</HI> Common Council, <HI>For the better Regu∣lation of the</HI> Weighing <HI>of Goods and Merchandizes at the</HI> KING's Beams.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEREAS it appertaineth to Iu∣stice, That to all Men be uprightly given true <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Measure;</HI></P>
<P>And whereas, for the more indif∣ferent and just <HI>Weighing</HI> of Goods and Merchandizes, which used to be Bought and Sold by <HI>Weight,</HI> within the City of <HI>LONDON</HI> and Liberties thereof, there are,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> and from the time, whereof the Memory of Man is not to the contrary, there have been certain <HI>Com∣mon Beams,</HI> within the said City and Liberties thereof commonly called the <HI>KING's BEAMS,</HI> at which there are and have been (during all the time aforesaid) certain sworn Offices who by the Duty of their Places have used, and ought con∣stantly to attend for the Weighing of such Goods and Merchandizes.</P>
<P>And whereas the Office of <HI>TRONAGE,</HI> or <HI>Weighing</HI> of all Goods and Merchandizes within the said City and Liberties thereof as well by Custom time out of mind, as by several ancient Charters and Acts of Parliament, is confirmed unto and vested in the <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Commonal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and <HI>Citizens</HI> of the said City.</P>
<P>And whereas all Goods and Merchandizes, of all Foreigners not being Free of the said City, which have been Sold or Bartered within the said City or Liberties, to any Person or Persons what∣soever, as well Freemen as others, ought and during all the time aforesaid have been accustom∣ed to be Weighed at one of the said <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ams,</HI> at or before the Sale or Delivery thereof.</P>
<P>And whereas divers Foreigners of late time not minding or regarding the good and wholsom Customs of the said City; but out of a Covetous desire, by sinister ways and unlawful means, to promote their own private Interests, have of∣tentimes Sold and Delivered such their Goods and Merchandizes within the said City, as well to Freemen of the said City as others, by other <HI>Weights</HI> and <HI>Beams,</HI> without weighing the same at any of the said <HI>Common Beams,</HI> whereby many Frauds, Injuries and Deceits have hapned and
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> been committed: And the better to palliate their Offence and avoid suspicion, do sometimes by Confederacy and Practice with some Freemen of the said City, cause Fraudulent and Clandestine Sales to be made of such their Goods and Mer∣chandizes to Freemen of the said City, before the same Goods or Merchandizes do come to the said City or Liberties thereof, contrary to the Oaths of such Freemen, and sometimes do mix their Goods with the Goods of other Persons that are Free of the said City, that so the distinct proper∣ty of the Goods of Foreigners, may not be known from those of Freemen: And other times do procure Freemen to be Partners with them in such Goods and Merchandizes, who many times have but a small and inconsiderable Share there∣in; and upon such and other like fraudulent means and pretences, hold themselves discharged from the Duty of Weighing such Goods at any of the said <HI>Beams,</HI> whereas in truth they are not, nor ought by any such Colour or Pre∣tence to be in any sort excused or discharged, of or from the said Duty.</P>
<P>For remedy whereof, It is hereby Enacted, Ordained and Declared by the <HI>Lord Mayor, Al∣dermen</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> of the City of <HI>London</HI> in <HI>Common Council</HI> assembled, and by the Authority of the same; That all Goods, Wares and Mer∣chandizes of any Person or Persons being a Fo∣reigner or Foreigners, and not Free of this City, of what kind soever usually Bought and Sold by Weight, at any time after the first day of <HI>January</HI> next ensuing, which shall be within or brought to the said City or Liberties thereof, and shall be Sold or Bartered to any Freeman or Freemen of the said City, or to any other Person or Persons whatsoever, within the said
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> City or Liberties thereof, shall at, or before the Delivery thereof to the Buyer, or any other Person or Persons, for his use, be Weighed at the said <HI>Common Beams,</HI> or one af them, upon pain of forfeiture of <HI>Thirteen shillings</HI> and <HI>Four pence</HI> for every <HI>Five hundred</HI> weight of such Wares and Merchandizes, to be paid by the Seller or Barterer thereof, and so after the same Rate for every greater or lesser quantity.</P>
<P>And for the further prevention of all Fraudu∣lent and Clandestine Dealings, which may hereafter be practised by any <HI>Freeman</HI> or <HI>Freemen</HI> of the said City, <HI>Foreigner</HI> or <HI>Foreigners</HI> in Buying of, or Bartering for Goods or Merchandizes of <HI>Foreigners</HI> and <HI>Strangers</HI> without the Freedom of the said City, to the intent to avoid the Duty of weighing such Goods and Merchandizes at the said <HI>Common Beams,</HI> and the reasonable Duty to be paid for the same: Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Sale shall be made by any such <HI>Foreigner</HI> or <HI>Foreigners,</HI> to any <HI>Freeman</HI> or <HI>Freemen</HI> of the said City, of any such Goods or Merchandizes, before the same Goods or Merchandizes come to this City, or the Liberties thereof, whereby they avoid the just Weighing such Goods or Merchandizes at one of the said <HI>Beams,</HI> and the Duty for Weighing thereof; and such Goods and Merchandizes shall afterwards come to this City or the Liberties there∣of, and shall after the said first day of <HI>January</HI> be Sold or Bartered, and delivered by such <HI>Fo∣reigner</HI> or <HI>Foreigners, Freeman</HI> or <HI>Freemen,</HI> to any other Person or Persons whatsoever, within the said City or Liberties thereof; Then such Goods or Merchandizes shall, at or before the Deli∣very thereof to such Person or Persons so Buy∣ing the same, be Weighed at the said <HI>Common
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> Beams</HI> called the <HI>King's Beams,</HI> or at one of them, up∣on pain to forfeit <HI>Thirteen shillings</HI> and <HI>Four pence,</HI> for every <HI>Five hundred</HI> weight, of such Wares or Merchandizes, to be paid by the Seller or Bar∣terer thereof, and so after that Rate for a greater or lesser quantity, notwithstanding any such Sale as aforesaid,</P>
<P>And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any <HI>Freeman</HI> or <HI>Freemen</HI> of this City, to whom such fraudulent Sale of such Goods or Merchandizes shall be made, as aforesaid; shall wittingly or willingly after the said first day of <HI>January,</HI> put in Vre, Iustifie or Endeavour to Maintain such Fraudulent Sale, to the intent to avoid the said just Weighing such Goods and Merchandizes, and the Duty to be paid for the same; Then every such <HI>Freeman</HI> shall forfeit for every such Offence the Sum of <HI>Five pounds.</HI></P>
<P>And it is hereby further Enacted and Decla∣red, That if any such Goods or Merchandizes, of any <HI>Freeman</HI> or <HI>Freemen</HI> of this City, shall be mixed with the Goods and Merchandizes of any <HI>Foreigner</HI> or <HI>Foreigners</HI> not Free of this City; so that the distinct Property and Proportion of each of them cannot be known and distinguished from other, and such Goods or Merchandizes so mixed and not divided, being within the said City or Liberties, shall at any time after the said first day of <HI>January,</HI> be Sold or Bartered within the same by such <HI>Freeman</HI> or <HI>Freemen, Foreigner</HI> or <HI>Foreigners,</HI> or by any, or either of them, to any other Person or Persons, before any Par∣tition, Division or Seperation be thereof made; Then all such Goods and Merchandizes, as well of such <HI>Freeman</HI> or <HI>Freemen,</HI> as of such <HI>Fo∣reigner</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> or <HI>Foreigners</HI> shall, at or before the Deli∣very thereof to any other Person or Persons so Buying the same, be Weighed at the said <HI>Com∣mon Beams,</HI> called the <HI>King's Beams,</HI> or at one of them; or in default thereof, as well the Buyer as the Seller thereof, shall each of them forfeit and pay the Sum of <HI>Thirteen shillings</HI> and <HI>Four pence</HI> for every <HI>Five hundred</HI> weight of such Wares and Merchandizes, and so after that Race for a greater or lesser quantity, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all such Goods and Merchan∣dizes usually Sold by weight, whereof any <HI>Freeman</HI> or <HI>Freemen</HI> shall be possessed, by Consign∣ment to be Sold, or Disposed for the benefit of any <HI>Foreigner</HI> not Free of the said City, or in Copartnership, or in Common with any <HI>Fo∣reigner</HI> by equal Moieties, or by any other Share or Shares, which at any time after the said first day of <HI>January,</HI> shall be Sold or Bartered, to any Person or Persons whatsoever within the said City or Liberties thereof, shall at, or be∣fore the Delivery thereof, be Weighed at the said <HI>Common Beams,</HI> or one of them, and in de∣fault thereof, the Seller or Sellers thereof shall forfeit and pay the Sum of <HI>Thirteen shillings</HI> and <HI>Four pence,</HI> for every <HI>Five hundred</HI> weight of such Wares and Merchandizes, and so after the same Rate for a greater or lesser quantity, as afore∣said.</P>
<P>And whereas, for defraying the necessary Charges of repairing, and maintaining the said <HI>Beams,</HI> and the <HI>Scales, Weights</HI> and other neces∣saries thereunto belonging, and likewise to en∣able the said <HI>Mayor, Commonalty</HI> and <HI>Citizens,</HI> to give reasonable recompence and satisfaction for
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> the care and attendance of such Persons, as are and shall be necessarily employed therein; There have been time out of mind paid to the said <HI>Mayor</HI> and <HI>Commonalty</HI> and <HI>Citi∣zens,</HI> their Deputies or Officers in that be∣half, certain reasonable Rates and Duties for Weighing such Wares and Merchan∣dizes; and the same have in all times been subject to the Alteration and Regulation of the <HI>Common Council</HI> of the said City.</P>
<P>Now, to the intent that the said Rates and Duties may be the better ascertained and made publick to all Persons concerned in Weighing, as aforesaid; And to pre∣vent the Officers and Collectors thereof from Demanding, Exacting or Receiving more than they ought to do: Be it further Ena∣cted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every Person or Persons not being Free of this City, who shall Sell and De∣liver, or Cause to be Sold and Deliver∣ed within the said City or Liberties thereof, any Goods or Merchandizes usually Bought and Sold by Weight, as aforesaid, shall from and after the said first day of <HI>January,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1698, pay or cause to be paid unto the <HI>Master Weigher</HI> or <HI>Super∣visor</HI> of such the said <HI>Common Beams,</HI> at which the said Goods or Merchandizes shall be weighed at, to the use of the said <HI>Mayor, Commonalty</HI> and <HI>Citizens</HI> or their Assigns, the Rates and Duties, following; (That is to say) for all Goods or Merchandizes whatsoever Sold by Weight, from <HI>Twenty eight pounds</HI> weight exclusive, to <HI>Two hundred</HI> weight inclusive, for each Draught <HI>Two pence:</HI> And from <HI>Two
