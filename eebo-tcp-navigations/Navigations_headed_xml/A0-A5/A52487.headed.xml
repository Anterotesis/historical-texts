<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE famous and ever to be admired Art of Navigation, having been so learnedly handled and written of, not only in all other Languages, but also in our Mother-Tongue, by so many learned and able men, both of former and of our present Age, that it may seem impossible to write any thing more thereof that hath not already been done by others; yet in my experience which I have seen, being at Sea in several Vessels, where divers young Mariners have been: I have heard this general Complaint among them, that though the things that are chiefly useful for them in their Art may be found in several Books here
<PB REF="3"/> and there dispersed; yet they could wish that there were such a Book contrived, that might be soley useful for them entire by it self, which then would be more convenient for them, and might be purchased at a more reasonable rate than otherwise they could be, by buying of so many sorts of Books, which they must be constrained to do, if ever they intend to be able Proficients in that most noble Profession of Navigation, at which they chiefly aimed.</P>
<P>This Complaint of theirs, was one chief Motive which induced me to collect and com∣pose the subsequent Treatise, which I have en∣deavoured to handle in such a methodical man∣ner, as it ought to be read and practised by the young Seaman. For</P>
<P>First, There is a Treatise of ARITHMETICK, containing all the Rules thereof, which are ne∣cessary for the Seaman to know and practise, all or most of the Questions thereof being made applicable in one kind or other to Nautical Affairs.</P>
<P>Secondly, There is a Treatise of GEOMETRY, containing the first Grounds and Principles thereof, with the making and dividing of the
<PB REF="3"/> Mariners Scale and Compass, with the pro∣jecting of the Sphere in Plano, and the resol∣ving of many Questions in Astronomy, which are useful in Navigation thereby.</P>
<P>Thirdly, you have a Treatise of the practick part of NAVIGATION, wherein is shewed, after a new experienced way used by the Author, how to keep a Reckoning at Sea: the making and use of the Plain Sea-Chart: the Doctrine of plain Triangles made applicable to such Questions in Navigation as concern Course, Distance, Rumb, Difference of Longitude, and Departure: likewise, a Table of Meridional parts to every third Minute, and the application and use there∣of exemplified in Questions of Sailing by <HI>Mer∣cator</HI>'s Chart: with Tables of Longitude and Latitude of Places, of right Ascension, and Sea∣sons of certain Fixed Stars, with Rules to keep a Reckoning, and to find the Latitude by the Meridian Altitude of the Sun or Stars.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There is a short Treatise of ASTRONOMY, wherein you have the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles applied to Questions in Astronomy and Navigation.</P>
<P>This is the brief Sum and Substance of the following Treatise, which I commend to the
<PB REF="4"/> Practice of all young Sea-men, desiring their kind acceptance of these my first Labours, which if I shall find to be kindly entertained by them, it will encourage me to lanch farther into the more nice and critical part of this most no∣ble Science. In the mean time I commend this to them, wishing good success in all their honest and laudable undertakings, and in the interim bid them Farewel.</P>

<HEAD>The Use of the Table to number.</HEAD>
<P>THis Table signifies thus much, That if there be one Figure alone, it is but so many units as there is in its name, as 7 is seven ones or units. If there be two Figures, the first Figure towards the left hand is as many tens as there is units in its name, and the other Figure is units: As if it were 10, that is ten units: if it were 23, the first Figure is two tens, that is twenty units: and the next Figure is 3, that is three units. The next place is hundreds, and con∣sists of three Figures, as 700 is seven hundred: 723 is seven
<PB N="2" REF="7"/> hundred twenty three. And thus you may count any Number by observing the place of any Figure, and in their places gi∣ving them their names as you count: As suppose I have a Num∣ber, namely 7864319, if you tell from 9 backwards to 7, you will find 7 in the place of millions, then begin and say seven millions: then if you count again, you will find 8 in the place of hundred thousands, 6 in the place of ten thousands, and 4 in the place of thousands, then to give them their proper Number, you will read thus: Seven millions for 7, eight hundred thou∣sand for 8, sixty thousand for 6, four thousand for 4, that is, Seven millions eight hundred sixty four thousand; then for 3 three hundred, for 1 ten, and for 9 nine units, that is then altogether 7 millions 8 hundred 64 thousand 3 hundred and ninteen, which is the quantity of units that is in the given Number 7864319. And thus much for Numeration.</P>

<P>In the first row towards the right hand, say 9 and 9 is 18, and 2 is twenty, and 2 is twenty two, which should be expressed thus 22: but because the next place is the place of tens, you set down 2 units, and carry the other two (which is two tens) and add them to the next row of tens, by saying 2 that I carried and 9 is eleven, and 9 is twenty, and so forwards, still doing so till you come to the last row, and as many tens as there is in that, so ma∣ny
<PB N="3" REF="7"/> set down to the left hand: as here it came but to 17, that is but one ten besides the 7: if they come to even tens (as here one row came to thirty) set down 0, and carry the tens to the next place, except it be in the last ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the left hand, and then set down 0, and your number of tens to the left hand of it.</P>

<P>Now you may ask a reason why I cast away the sixes, the reason is because 6 tens make a degree: now with the three tens that I carried, and the tens that where in the row added up last, there were 20 tens, that must be 3 degrees and 2 tens over: the 3 degrees I carry to the place of degrees, and the two tens I set down in the place of tens: and thus in any other Sum.</P>

<P>The same is to be done in Addition of Money, only remem∣bring in the place of pence to go no farther than 12, because twelve pence make a shilling, as you do here to 60, because 60′ makes a degree, and in shillings no farther than twenty, because twenty shillings make a pound. And thus in any thing else (pro∣vided that you know how many of the one makes one of the other) but for such things they are not so necessary to the thing we purpose to handle, and therefore I refer you to Mr. <HI>Hodder</HI>'s Book, it being of small price, and much matter, and likewise very plain.</P>

<HEAD>Subtraction.</HEAD>
<P>SUbtraction is the taking a lesser number from a greater, and to see what remains: As suppose a man was bound from <HI>Cales</HI> to <HI>Dover,</HI> which is 21 miles: now if he have sailed 11 miles of the way, I demand what he hath yet to sail? Take 11 from 21, and the remainder is 10, so I conclude he hath 10 miles still to sail before he come to <HI>Dover:</HI> but in greater numbers they are ordinarily set so that you are forced to borrow, so that they are something harder.</P>

<P>IT doth Addition many times, for when you have many Addi∣tions it makes one work of it, and also of two given Numbers it increaseth the greater as often as there is units in the lesser, or the lesser as often as there is units in the greater. Now in multiplying there are three things considerable.</P>
<P>First, The Multiplicand, or Number that you would multiply.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Multiplier, or Number you multiply by.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Product or Sum produced.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>I demand how many Feet there are in</HI> 320 <HI>Yards, every Yard being three Feet?</HI></P>
<P>If you set down 320 yards one under the other three times, and add them, you will have the sum of 320 yards in feet: but that is a tedious way, for then you must set down your 320
<PB N="8" REF="10"/> yards an hundred times one under the other, if there were one hundred times so much (of any thing) in it: but now Multipli∣cation doth it at once; because there is 3 foot in a yard, there∣fere there must be three times 320 foot in 320 yards.</P>

<P>Quest. 2 <HI>I demand how many Minutes is in</HI> 360 <HI>Degrees?</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> Note that 60 minutes is one degree: it is less work always to make your greatest Number your Multiplicand, and then it stands as in the Margin: then say 0 no∣thing is 0, set down 0; then 0 six is 0, set it down; then 0 three is 0, set it down: then go to 6, and say 6 times 0 is 0, set it down, one figure to the left hand under the former; then say 6 times 6 is 36, set down 6 and carry 3; then say 6 times 3 is 18, and 3 that I carried is 21, set down 1 and car∣ry 2; now because there is no more figures, set down the two (as I have shewed in Addition) and thus 360 degrees is 21600 minutes, if both the Products be added together. Then to prove your work, add up your Multiplicand, and cast away the nines from it, and set the remainder down over the Cross; then cast away the nines of the Multi∣plier if it comes to 9, but if not, set it down under the Cross; then multiplie 6 by 0, and it makes 0, set down that on the right side of the Cross; then cast up your Product, and cast away the nines from it, and if it comes to the same that the Multi∣plicand and Multiplier did, (the nines being cast away) then the sum is done right, and stands as you see in the Margin.

<P>DIvision is that by which one may know (at one operation) any part of a whole Number, provided that the part be not under an unit: by part I mean thus, the third of a number, or the fourth of a number, or the twentieth part of a number, or the like.</P>
<P>In Division there are four things considerable: First, the Dividend; Secondly, the Divisor; Thirdly, the Quotient; And fourthly, the Remainder after the Division.</P>
<P>The Dividend is the number which you desire to have divided, or to have a part known.</P>
<P>The Divisor is that which you divide it by, or the name of the part which you would have known.</P>
<P>The Quotient is the number of units that is contained in the part required.</P>

<P>The fourth part of 365 days must needs be the number of days which this man will be doing the Piece of Work, there∣fore divide 365 days by 4, and the Quotient shall be the whole days, and the remainder of the Division shall be the parts of a day above the whole days. 91 days, and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> one fourth of a day is a quarter of a year, or the quantity of time he will be doing this Work. We express a Fraction thus: one fourth ¼, two fifths ⅖, or so for any Fraction.</P>

<TABLE>

</TABLE> Which is thus: First, set down your Divi∣dend 365; then to the left hand set down
<PB N="11" REF="11"/> the Divisor under your Dividend. but you will ask why I did not set it under the 3? And the reason is, because 4 is more than 3, so that I could have had nothing from 3 till I had remo∣ved it where it is: if 3 had been a number that I could have took my Divisor from, I would have set the 4 under the 3.</P>
<P>Your Sum being set, say how many times 4 can you have in 36? Nine times. Set down 9 in the Quotient, and multiply 4 by 9, saying 9 times 4 is 36, from 36 and the remainder is 0: cancel 4 and 36 as you go (by a dash with your pen) and your work stands thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Then set your 4 under the 5, and say how many times 4 can you have from 5? Once. Set down 1 in the Quotient, and multiply it by 4, saying, once 4 is 4, from 5, and the remainder is 1: set 1 over the 5, cancelling your 4 and 5 by a dash with your pen (as you speak:) now because there is no more figures, your sum is done, and stands thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> The 1 which remains is ¼ of a unit (because the Di∣vidend is units) for whatsoever the Dividend is, the Quotient and the Remainder shall be a part of it: it hath its Denomination or Name from the Divisor 4.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>A man had an Estate of</HI> 78998 l. <HI>now he oweth to</HI> 23 <HI>several men</HI> 27821 l. <HI>apiece. I demand what each man shall have of the Estate, so that none of them may be wronged?</HI></P>
<P>You will conclude because they were owed alike, they should have alike of that which was left, therefore divide the Estate by 23, and the Quotient with the Remainder will be each mans due.</P>
<P>Each will have 3434 <HI>l.</HI> 16/23 of a pound for his Debt. <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>This is Division of two figures when the Divisor is two figures, and it is something harder than the other Example: The work∣ing
<PB N="12" REF="12"/> of it is thus, first set your Sum in order thus:
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>78998 (</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>23</CELL>

</TABLE> Then I say, how many times 2 can you have from 7? Three times: 3 times 2 is 6, from 7 and there remains 1 (set 3 in the Quotient) and say again 3 times 3 is 9, from 18, and there remains 9, then your Sum stands thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>You might have said 3 times 3 is 9, from 8 I cannot, but 9 from 18, and the Remain∣der is 9, and 1 (for your borrowed one ten) from 1, and there remains 0, which is most easie for memory.</P>
<P>Then set your Divisor on place further towards the right hand in this form: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> </P>
<P>How many times 2 can you have from 9? Four times: then 4 times 2 is 8, from 9, and there remains 1, and 4 times 3 is 12, from 19 and the Remainder is 7: and 1 (for the ten) from 1, and the Remainder is 0; and then your Sum stands thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Then remove your Divisor to the next place, and see how many times 2 you can have out of 7, which is 3 times: 3 times 2 is 6, from 7 and the remainder is 1: and 3 times 3 is 9, from 9 and the remainder is 0; and your Sum stands thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> </P>
<P>Then remove your Divisor to the next place, and see how many times 2 you can have from 10? which is 5 times: now 5 times 2 is 10, from 10 and there remains 0, and 5 times 3 is 15, from 8 I cannot (you see 8 is all that is left, so that you have no∣thing to horrow from) therefore you could not take 5 times 23 from 108, try for 4 times, 4 times 2 is 8, from 10, and the remainder is 2, and 4 times 3 is 12, from 28 I can, you see you may take 4: set 4 in the Quotient, and say 4 times 2 is 8, from 0 I cannot, but 8 from 10, and the remainder is 2, and 1 that I borrowed from 1, and the remainder is 0, (cancel as you speak) then 4 times 3 is 12: now 12 from 28, and the remain∣der
<PB N="13" REF="12"/> is 16; but it is better to use your self to this method, namely, to take your units from the place of units, and your tens from the place of tens, as here 2 is in the place of units, and 8 above, therefore say 2 from 8, and there remains 6, and 1 (for the ten) from 2 and the remainder is 1: Now if this had fallen out so that the upper number had been 21, and the other 12, you know that 12 will be taken out of 21, but 2 would not be taken out of 1; now in such a case borrow one 10, and say as in Subtraction, 2 from 1 I cannot, but 2 from 11 and the remainder is 9, one 10 that I borrowed and 1 is 2, from 2 and there remains 0, and thus it is done at once: The reason why it is done this way is, because the Sum you are to take from may be big, so that a man cannot tell readily what the remainder will be without Subtraction; for this differs nothing from Subtraction, as it is shewed before, but only that you carry one number in your head, whereas there both the numbers are before you.</P>
<P>The hardest Sum in Division hath but these Difficulties in them:</P>
<P>First, Be sure take no more to set in the Quotient, than your Divisor multiplied by it) will come under the Number you are to take it from, or equal to it.</P>
<P>Secondly, Be sure you take the one as many times as you can from the other.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Be careful in takeing one number from another, to use this way of Subtraction.</P>
<P>This Sum is done, and stands thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> And it signifies that the 23. part of 78998 is 3434 units and 16/23 of a unit.</P>

<P>The best way to prove Division is by Multiplication, for if you multiply your Quotient by the Divifor, and add in the Remainder, that product will be equal to the Dividend, if the Sum be right, and it stands to reason it should be so, for if the Quotient with the remainder be in this Sum the 2345th. part of the Dividend, then 'tis evident that 2345 times that Quo∣tient must be the same that the Dividend is (with the remainder which is added in.)</P>

<P>Here you see the Example of it, and the Product the same that the Dividend of the Sum divided was, and this I say is the best way for young Practitioners to prove Division, be∣cause this makes them perfect in Mul∣tiplication.</P>
<P>There is a shorter way to prove any Sum in Division, and that is this: Cast up your Quotient, and cast away all the nines from it, (as you do in Multiplication) and what remains set down upon one side of a Cross thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Then cast away your nines from your Divisor in like manner, and there remains 5, set it down on the other side against 4 thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Multiply them one by the other, and they pro∣duce 20, cast away all the nines from 20, and the remainder is 2, keep this 2 in mind, and cast up the remainder of the Division, and cast all the nines from it: which if it be done in this Sum, afterwards there will remain 3, which add to the 2 that was in your mind, and it makes 5, which set down thus: <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Then cast away all the nines from your Divi∣dend, and the remainder will answer to the last number you set down in the Cross, if the Sum be right, which here it is <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>

<HEAD>Reduction.</HEAD>
<P>REduction sheweth how to bring gross or great Denomina∣tions into small, or small into great.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>Suppose a Man had been at Sea twenty five Years, and for every Minute of that time he was to have on Farthing, I demand how many farthings is due to him?</HI></P>
<P>Here I see how many minutes is in that quantity of time, and so many minutes so many farthings there is due, which is, 13140000 farthings. Now to find this, I first multiply the years by the days con∣tained in one year, which is 365, and that produceth 9125 days, the number of days in that number of years: this mul∣tiplied by 24 gives for its Product 219000 the number of hours in the whole time, because 24 hours is a day. That Product multiplied by 60, is the number of minutes in the whole time (because every hour is 60 minutes) which is the last Product, or the thing required, which I set down as the Answer to my Question thus, <HI>Facit</HI> 13140000 farthings.
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>Pray tell me what these farthings come to in Pounds, Shillings, and Pence,</HI> 1740120 <HI>Farthings.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
<P>Four farthings make a penny, therefore I divide the whole Sum of Farthings by 4, and the Quotient is ½ of the number of farthings, or the farthings reduced into pence, 435030 <HI>d.</HI> of which Sum I take the 1/12 by dividing it by 12, which is the next Quotient (the number of shillings that is the farthings) which is 36252 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Twenty shillings make a pound, therefore I take the twentieth part of this last Product, by dividing it by 20, and that Quotient shall be pounds, and the remainder of the Division shillings: 1812 <HI>l.</HI> 12 <HI>s.</HI> The Answer of your desire I will set down thus: 1812 <HI>l.</HI> — 12 <HI>s.</HI> —6 <HI>d.</HI> </P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>Some say that in a Mile there is</HI> 1760 <HI>Paces, three Feet being one Pace, twelve Inches one Foot, three Barley-corns being one Inch: I pray tell me how many Barley-corns will reach three Mi.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Because there is 3 miles, 3 times 1760 is the number of paces contained in 3 miles: then because 3 foot is 1 pace, multiply 5280 by 3, and it produceth the number of feet that is in 3 miles; then because 12 inches is a foot, multiply your feet by 12, and it pro∣duceth 190080, the number of inches contained in 3 miles: and because 3 Barley-Corns make an inch, multiply your inches by 3, and it gives you the number of barly-corns that are in 3 miles, and the same is to be understood for any other number of miles.</P>
<P>Suppose I would know how many Miles is in the same number of Barley-corns, namely, 570240 Barley-corns.</P>
<P>As before you multiplied to bring Miles into Barley-corns, so now divide to bring things of small Denomination into great, only begin at the lowest, where before you ended, for the de∣mand of this is the beginning of the other.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Here the Quotient of the first Division is Inches, because three Barly-corns make an Inch, namely, 190080 Inches.</P>
<P>The Quotient of the second Division is the number of Feet contained in those Inches, (and therefore the Inches were di∣vided by 12) namely, 15840 Feet.</P>
<P>The Quotient of the third Division is Paces, and therefore it was divided by 3, the number is 5280 Paces.</P>
<P>The Quotient of the last Division is the number of Miles con∣tained in either 570240 Barly-corns, or 190080 Inches, or 15840 Feet, or 5280 Paces, which is 3 Miles, the thing required: And after the same manner you may reduce minutes into degrees, or seconds into minutes and degrees, or degrees into hours, pounds into shillings, shillings into pence, and pence into far∣things, or the contrary, by knowing how many of the one makes one of the other.</P>

<HEAD>The Proof of Reduction.</HEAD>
<P>The Proof of Reduction is the same thing which we did last, I framed it so for brevities sake. When you would prove any Sum that is brought into a small Denomination (by Multiplica∣tion,) divide it backwards, beginning with the Product of your last Multiplication, and compare them in each as you do it, and if the Sum be right they will agree.</P>
<P>When you would prove any Sum that is brought into a great∣er Denomination (by Division) then as before you divided, so now multiply; for I have shewed that Multiplication and Divi∣sion is the Proof one of the other.</P>
<P>Quest. 4. <HI>I will reduce</HI> 28 <HI>degrees</HI> 20′ 40″ <HI>into seconds.</HI></P>
<P>First Multiply your degrees by 60, and it brings them into minutes, add your odd 20 minutes to that Product, and it makes
<PB N="19" REF="15"/> the number of minutes in that given number of degrees and minutes: multiply that by 60, and it produceth the number of seconds contained in that given number of degrees and minutes: to that Product add your odd 40 seconds, and it gives the number of seconds contained in the degrees, mi∣nutes, and seconds, as here in this Example: and the reason is, because 60 minutes is a degree, and 60 seconds is a minute: The same is to be understood of the reducing of any number of several Denominations into one.

<P>Thus much for what Mariners have need to know in Reduction.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That the Remainder of any Division either in Redu∣ction, the rule of Three, or in any Division, is some part of a Unit, namely thus: If the Quotient be shillings, the remainder is some part of a shilling: If the Quotient be pounds, the remain∣der is some part of a pound. The remainder is the Numerator, and the Divisor is the Denominator of the Fraction; so that if the Quotient were pounds, and the remainder 12, the Di∣visor is 20, and the Fraction is the 12/20 of a pound, which is 12 shillings; the like for any thing else.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Golden Rule, <HI>or</HI> Rule of Three.</HEAD>
<P>THis Rule well understood, is the Sum of the rest that fol∣low it; for they are all (but as it were this Rule) it is cal∣led <HI>The Golden Rule,</HI> because it is the Foundation of the rest: It is called <HI>The Rule of Three,</HI> because three numbers are given to find a fourth.</P>
<P>Now there is the Rule of Three direct, and the Back Rule of Three: the Rule of Three direct, is for such questions as are so stated, that the third number and second multiplied together, and that Product divided by the first gives the fourth.</P>
<P>The Back Rule of Three is so stated, that the first number
<PB N="20" REF="16"/> and the second are multiplied together, and that Product divi∣ded by the third, finds the fourth.</P>
<P>And this is all the distinction that I can make between the forward and backward Rule of Three, which is all the Rule of Three: I will not make therefore two distinct Rules of them, (but one) therefore pray observe this difference:</P>
<P>In all Questions in the Rule of Three there is three things given to find a fourth, which number will have alike proportion to the third, as the second hath to the first.</P>
<P>In stating your Question, be sure let it be so that you may set your sum in order with the first and third number, speaking both of one thing: I mean if the first be Ells let the third be Ells; if the first be Degrees, let the third be degrees, or some∣thing that Degrees can be reduced to.</P>
<P>If your Sum be set with the numbers in several Denominations, before you bring your Sum in order, you must reduce your num∣bers into the least Denomination: As suppose your Sum was this, If 5 pound 10 ounces of Tobacco, cost 10 shillings 9 pence, what shall 510 pounds cost? Reduce your 5 pounds 10 ounces into ounces, and your 510 pounds into ounces: likewise your shillings into pence, taking in the odd pence and odd ounces, as I have shewed how to do it in page 16 and 17.</P>
<P>Your Sum being reduced (as I have shewed) into the least Denominations, set it in order thus:</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> 90 <HI>Ounces cost</HI> 129 <HI>pence, what costs</HI> 81600 <HI>ounces?</HI></P>
<P>Your Sum being in order, consider whether your third num∣ber require more or less: if it require more, multiply the second number by the greatest of the two extreams, and divide that Product by the lesser, it produceth the fourth number in the same Denomination that the middle number was.</P>
<P>If your third number require less, multiply the middle num∣ber by the least of the two extremes, and divide that product by the greatest, and it gives your fourth number in the same denomi∣nation that your second number was; then if you desire to reduce it into greater Denomination, do it as I have shewed already.</P>
<P>For your better understanding of this Rule of Three, I have here following done an Example of it in right Lines, and have found it upon this Question.</P>

<P>Here you see the last number required is more than the middle most, for 20 men must be longer about the work than 27 men, therefore I multiplied the middle number by the first, because it is bigger than the third.</P>
<P>If in 10 days 16/20 of a day 20 men rigg a Ship, how many shall do it in 8 days?</P>
<P>Here the number of days must both be brought into 20 of days (that is such parts as 20 makes 1) which is done by multi∣plying the days by 20, now the reason is because the first num∣ber is of several Denominations, and must be brought into the lowest; which is the Denomination here mentioned.</P>

<P>I'll set my Question in order thus:</P>
<P>If 100 <HI>l.</HI> gives 6 <HI>l.</HI> what shall the principal 478 give?</P>
<P><HI>Facit</HI> 28 <HI>l.</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Here we have found what the Principle hath gained for a twelve-month, next consider what proportion 12 Months is to the time your money was lent, which was 24 Months: now if
<PB N="25" REF="18"/> it had been three times as long a time as 12 Months, you must have made it 3 times as much as you find it for 12 Months, but being but twice as much, you must make the Use to to be twice 28 68/100 which is 57 <HI>l.</HI> 36/100 of a pound; the same is to be understood of any number else; but in stead of seeing what proportion the time limited for the lent bears with 12 Months, you may work it as you do the Rule of five Numbers, by saying (after you have abbreviated your Fraction.)</P>
<P>If 12 Months give 28 <HI>l.</HI> 68/100, what shall 24 Months gain? But I say the other way is best, after your other manner; If it had been one fourth of the time, it would have been ¼ of the use; if one fifth of the time, ⅕ of the use. For it stands to reason, that if 100 <HI>l.</HI> or any other quantity gains 6 <HI>l.</HI> in twelve Months. it gains four times as much in four times the time, or five times as much in five times twelve Months, and so forth.</P>
<P>I might say something of Interest upon Interest, but that differs but little from this: At the years end, add in your simple Interest to your Principal, and make it one entire Sum till the next year, then add that Interest to the Principal the year before, and receive the Interest of it: this is all it differs from the former.</P>

<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> other: now the place where they cross or intersect, is called the <HI>Angular Point,</HI> as in this figure A is the <HI>Angular Point.</HI> All Angles that are bounded by streight lines, are called <HI>right lined Angles,</HI> as the Angle A.</P>
<P>A <HI>Triangle</HI> is when three lines meet, ma∣king three angular points; now there be two sorts, right lined, and spherical: spherical being all the sides Arches of great Circles. There be three sorts of Angles, namely, obtuse, acute, and right angles.</P>
<P>A <HI>right angled Triangle,</HI> is when a line is drawn from another line, so exactly upright, that it leans neither one way nor other,

</FIGURE> Angles will contain an Arch of 90 degrees, which is a quarter of a Circle, but will be all less, as you see in the acute angled Triangle V S A.</P>
<P>An <HI>obtuse angled Triangle</HI> is when the lines are so drawn, that one of the Angles is bounded by above a Quadrant, or the ¼ of a Circle, as is<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> the Angle at K, see 8 u is above ¼ of a Circle: whatsoever part of a Circle any Angle bounds, that Arch is the measure or con∣tents in degrees or points of that Angle, as the Arch u 8 is the measure of the Angle at K, the Center of the Arch is K. When in writing we would express an Angle in letters, we set the middle letter for the Angle that is meant, as here O R K is the obtuse Angle at K. The Complement of an Angle or Arch, is what it wants of 90 degrees or a Quadrant: or sometimes (if need require) what it wants of a Semicircle, which is twice 90 or 180 degrees.</P>
<P>A <HI>Circle</HI> is a plain figure, swept out by a pair of Compasses
<PB N="30" REF="21"/> from the Center, which is the place where one foot of the Compasses stands fixed, whilest the other describes it; some call it a limb or perimeter: that<FIGURE>

(I shall do both) The reason I handle this here, is in order to Navigation, that you may understand the Circles of the Sphere. This by way of Advertisement.</P>
</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>BEfore I shew how to project the Sphere, it will be necessary to understand the Circles of the Sphere.</P>
<P>A Sphere is a Scheme or Figure which represents the Heavens, and therefore is round exactly, though upon a Plain it doth not seem so; from whence it is evident, that the lines here drawn in it cannot be streight lines, but Circles: Now there are two sorts of Circles, namely, the Greater Circles, and the Lesser; the Greater Circles are such as go round the very Body of the Globe, and so cut through two opposite points, dividing it into two Hemispheres, and are six in number, which are these:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Axis of the World. (From South to North Pole.)</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The Horizon.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>The Aequinoctial.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>The Ecliptick.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>The East and West Azimuth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>The Meridian.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The smaller Circles of the Sphere, are all such Circles as do not divide the Sphere of Heaven into two Hemispheres, and so are less than those that do; and they be four, namely, The two Tropicks, and the two Polar Circles, which to distinguish
<PB N="47" REF="29"/> the Southermost from the Northermost, we call the Souther∣most Tropick, <HI>Capricorn;</HI> the Northermost, <HI>The Tropick of Cancer;</HI> the Southermost Polar Circle, <HI>The Antartick;</HI> and the Northermost, <HI>The Artick Circle.</HI></P>
<P>All Circles that cut through the two Poles of the World, are called Meridians; and are also Great Circles, because they di∣vide the Sphere into two Hemispheres, cutting in two opposite points: it is certain, if a Circle goeth through two opposite points, it is as great a Circle as that globous Body can bear, and must divide that Body into two Hemispheres, as doth the Meridian A B C D.</P>
<P>The Poles are two opposite places in the Heavens, and are the ends (as it where) of that Line called the Axletree, which the Heavens may be imagined to turn upon: here that Line is called the <HI>Axis of the World.</HI></P>
<P>The Aequinoctial is a Great Circle of the Sphere, which lieth between the Pole so equally, that its distance from either Pole is 90 degrees (the half of the distance between the Poles) and because it is so equal between them, there begins Latitude; so that whatsoever Latitude you are in, so many degrees and mi∣nutes the Aequinoctial is below that part of the Heavens which is right over your head, and is called the Zenith; or from being right under you, which is called the Nadir. All Meridians cut this Aequinoctial at right Angles.</P>
<P>The East and West Azimuth is a Great Circle of the Sphere that cuts through two opposite points of the Heavens, namely, the Zenith and Nadir: it also cuts the Horizon at right Angles in the points of East and West; and therefore is called the East and West Azimuth: all Azimuths are great Circles and cut the Horizon at right Angles.</P>
<P>The Horizon is a Great Circle of the Sphere, and divides that part of the Heavens which we do not see, from that part which we do see: or it is the furthest part of the Heavens which we can see for the Body of the Sea; it is only to be seen at Sea, or upon the shore where there is no land between you and it, and so you have divers Horizons according to your motion, for as you raise one part of the World, you lay the other.</P>

<P>The Zodiack is a great Circle, it is the bounds of the twelve Signs: now in the middle of it is the Ecliptick Line, in which Line the Center of the Sun goeth, and passeth every day its mo∣tion of Declination, till it comes to its utmost bounds, which is to the Tropicks: it cuts the Aequinoctial in two opposite points, and makes from these points an Angle of 23 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> which is the Angle S R t, so the Sun is never out of it. The twelve Signs divide this Ecliptick into twelve equal parts, and to every Sign theee is a Name, and a Character for that Name, and a Month to that Sign; which for your better knowledge I have here following inserted.</P>

<P>Six of these be Northern Signs, and are in the North part of the Zodiack; and six of them are Southern Signs, because they be in the South part of the Zodiack.

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How to Project a Sphere.</HEAD>
<P>THis Sphere or Scheme is projected on this wise: First, take an Arch of 60 <HI>deg.</HI> from your Scale of Chords, and describe the Meridian M A E R. Now the reason you take just 60 <HI>deg.</HI> is because that number of degrees taken from the Scale is the Semidiameter of the Circle the Scale was made by: so then whatsoever you take from that Circle, and apply to the Scale, it will be the quantity of it in degrees and minutes; or from the Scale if you take any distance, and apply it to the Circle, it will be the same quantity upon the Circle, that it was upon the Scale.</P>
<P>The Meridian being thus described, draw the line A R through the Center, which represents the Horizon: Cross that at right Angles, and draw the line E M, which is the East and West Azimuth.</P>
<P>Then because the Sphere is made for the Latitude of 50 <HI>deg.</HI> take 50 <HI>deg.</HI> from your Scale of Chords, and fix one foot in the Horizon at A, and set the other foot upwards to B, (make a prick or mark) which is to signifie that the North Pole is ele∣vated or raised above the Horizon so many degrees as the La∣titude is.</P>
<P>Keep the same distance in your Compasses, and go to E with one foot, and let fall the other upon the Meridian on the left hand, which will be at G, and will represent that point of the Aeqinoctial that cuts the Meridian of that place which is the nearest point of the Aequinoctial to that Zenith, and is as much below the Zenith, as the Pole is above the Horizon.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="31"/>

<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Keep the same distance, and carry your Compasses to the Ho∣rizon at R, and let fall the other point to K in the Meridian, which is the South Pole; for as much as the North Pole is ele∣vated above the North part of the Horizon (at A) so much is the South Pole depressed below the South part of the Horizon at K.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="31"/>
<P>Continue the same distance between your Compasses, and fix one foot in the Nadir at M, and set the other foot upon the Meridian upwards to O, which is the other point of the Aequi∣noctials intersection in the Meridian opposite to the former; and it stands to good reason, that as much as the Aequinoctial is below the Zenith, so much it ought to be above the Nadir: These marks being set off, draw the Axis of the World B K, and the Aequinoctial G O. And because (as I said before) the outmost bounds of the Suns Declination is 23 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> (either to the Northwards or Southwards of the Aequinoctial, which bounds are expressed by the Tropicks) take 23 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> from your Scale of Chords, and fix your Compasses at O in the Aequinoctial, and set it off on both sides to P and N, carry the same distance to G, and set it off in like manner from G to F and H, then draw F P and H N, which are the Tropicks: also draw the Ecliptick from F to N, which will fall through the Center. Always set the same distance from both Poles on both sides upon the Meridian, and draw D C the Artick, and I L the Antartick Circles. And thus you may project a Sphere by a Plain Scale: The like for any other.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the Questions, it will be necessary to give you the meaning of things that will be spoke to.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Meaning of the Terms used in the following Work.</HEAD>
<P>THe Latitude of any place is the Distance between the Zenith of that place, and the Aequinoctial in degrees and minutes.</P>
<P>The Elevation of the Pole is always equal to it, and is the Poles height above the Horizon in degrees and minutes.</P>
<P>Altitude signifies the Height of a thing: If it be meant of a Star, or of the Sun (not being upon the Meridian) it is meant the Distance between the Sun or Star and the Ho∣rizon.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="32"/>
<P>Meridian Altitude is the Suns height above the Horizon, when he is upon the Meridian of that place, which is at 12 of the Clock; or at any other time when a Star is upon the Meridian either North or South.</P>
<P>The Suns true Amplitude of rising or setting signifies the number of degrees and minutes that the Sun riseth from the East, or sets from the West points of the Compass in the Horizon, as it is found in the Sphere.</P>
<P>The Suns true Azimuth of rising or setting signifies the di∣stance (in degrees and minutes) of the Suns rising or setting (in the Horizon) from the North or South points in the Compass, as it is found in the Sphere.</P>
<P>There is the true Amplitude of the Suns rising and set∣ting, and the Magnetical Amplitude; the Magnetical Am∣plitude is the degree of the Compass that he is observed to rise or set upon, and is Called Magnetical Amplitude from the Load-stone: The Magnetical Azimuth is Called so for the same reason, and is the Suns rising from the South or North.</P>
<P>Longitude is the Easting or Westing between two places in degrees and minutes, if in sailing.</P>
<P>Departure from the Meridian is the Easting or Westing between two places in miles or leagues.</P>
<P>Latitude, as I have said, is the Distance of the Aequi∣noctial from the Zenith of that place in degrees and minutes, or the Elevation of the Pole; but Difference of Latitude is the Northing or Southing that a Ship makes in any Di∣stance run, or between two places, either in degrees, leagues, or miles.</P>
<P>Declination (if it be meant by the Sun, or any Star that is near the Aequinoctial) is the nearest distance between the Sun or Star and the Aequinoctial.</P>
<P>Stars that are nearer the Poles, their Declination are their nearest Distance to the Poles.</P>
<P>The Suns place in the Ecliptick is his nearest Distance from the place where the Suns Parallel of Declination cuts the Ecliptick to the next Aequinoctial point, which is ♈ or ♎.</P>

<HEAD><HI>QUESTION I.</HI> To find the Meridian Altitude of the Sun.</HEAD>
<P>IN this or any other Sphere, M G E is that part of the Hea∣vens that is visible, the other half invisible to us; for it is parted from our sight by the Earth and Sea, and the furthest part of it, which seems to mix as it were with the Heavens, we call the Horizon, which is the great Circle M E (for it is a great Circle, though here we are forced to represent it by a streight Line) M is the South point of the Horizon: Now the Suns Meridian Altitude is his distance between that point and the place he cuts the Meridian that day, which is M I; fix your Compasses in M, and extend the other foot to I, and apply it to your Scale of Chords, and as many degrees as you find it there, so many degrees is the Sun high when he is upon the Meridian that day, which is the thing required.</P>
<P>Note that at O the Sun riseth, at P it is 6 of the Clock, and P I is equal to ♈ K (when it is extended to a great Circle) and both the Sine of 90 <HI>deg.</HI> which is extended to a Chord, must be the Chord of as many degrees, which is 6 hours in time. The time between 6 a Clock and 12, which proves that M I is the Meridian Altitude of the Sun: and this measuring any Distance from the Meridian is called <HI>The first Way of Measuring.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>QUESTION II.</HI> To find the Suns Amplitude of Rising and Setting.</HEAD>
<P>FIx one foot of your Compasses in the place of the Suns Rising, which is O, and extend the other foot to the Center of the Sphere (which is termed the East point of the Horizon) and this Distance apply to your Line of Sines (if you have any) but if you have no line of Sines, extend it to the Chord of the same Arch, thus: Fix your Compasses with that distance, one foot in the Meridian, so that the other may just sweep a line that goeth through the Center of the Sphere,
<PB N="56" REF="34"/> then, say I, the Arch between that foot of your Compasses that stands in the Circle, and the place where this line you sweep cuts the Circle, is the Chord of the thing required, and will be the same number of degrees upon the line of Chords, as O R would be upon the line of Sines: and after this manner is the Chord of any distance (taken from a line that goeth through the Center of the Sphere) found: and this is called <HI>The second Way of Measuring.</HI></P>
<P>I find that the Sun riseth 20 <HI>deg.</HI> 53 <HI>min.</HI> to the Northwards of the East (for she hath North Declination, and the Latitude is Northerly) or sets so much to the Northwards of the West.</P>

<HEAD><HI>QUESTION III.</HI> To find the Suns Azimuth at six of the Clock.</HEAD>
<P>THe Suns Azimuth at 6 of the Clock, is the nearest distance between the Sun at 6 of the Clock, and the East and West Azimuth, which is P z: Now if you mind it, P z is taken off from a Circle, which is not so great as the Horizon, and yet is parallel to it, as the line n w is parallel to the line M E; and as many degrees as the Sun is from the nearest part of the East and West Azimuth in the little Circle, so many he is from it (if an Azimuth where drawn) in the great Circle, for P z is as many degrees in the little Circle, as n ♈ is in the great one: Now because your Scale is made by the great Circle, therefore ex∣tend the distance taken from the lesser Circle to the measure of the greater, which is done thus:</P>
<P>Take half the length of the pricked line which is z w, and fixing one foot of your Compasses in the Center of the Sphere, describe an Arch from some line that goeth through the Center of the Sphere, as the Arch M l n, then set the distance z P as a Sine upon that Arch (for it is a Sine upon that Arch as well as o ♈ was a Sine upon the Meridian) I find the Sine of it is the Sine of the Arch l M, lay your Scale from the Center of the Sphere by l, and draw the line l q then shall q M be the same quantity of degrees upon the great Circle, as l M is upon the little one: therefore take M q and apply it to the Scale of Chords, and it answers your desire. And thus is the Suns Azi∣muth at 6 of the Clock, P z found to be 8 <HI>deg.</HI> 36 <HI>min.</HI> to the Northwards of the East, and this is called <HI>The third way of Mea∣suring,</HI> to measure any distance from a line that doth not go through the Center (which must represent a small Circle) And thus you may find the Suns Azimuth at any time of the day.</P>

<P>I find the Sun is 10 <HI>deg.</HI> 7 <HI>min</HI> high at 6 of the Clock.</P>

<HEAD><HI>QUESTION V.</HI> To find the Suns height being due East or West.</HEAD>
<P>VVHere the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the East and West Azimuth, is the place the Sun is in, when he is due East in the morning, for you see he is then over the point of East in the Horizon, which is ♈ (or the Center) there∣fore take the distance between that place and the Center (which is S ♈) and apply it to the line of Sines; but if you have no line of Sines, extend it to a Chord after the manner of the second Question, which I call the <HI>The second way of Measuring,</HI> for it is the distance of a line which goeth through the Center.</P>
<P>I find the Suns height being due East or West, is 17 <HI>deg.</HI> 25 <HI>m.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> that the same height that the Sun is being over the East point, so high he is being over the West point in the afternoon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="question">
<HEAD><HI>QUESTION VI.</HI> To find the Difference of Ascension.</HEAD>
<P>THe Difference of Ascension, is the portion of time that is between the Suns Rising and six of the Clock: If the days be longer than the nights, the Sun riseth before 6; but if shorter, after 6; but whether it be before or after 6 that he riseth, so many hours and minutes as it is from 6, so much is the half day or night longer or shorter than 6 hours, from whence it is evi∣dent, that if the Sun riseth due East, he riseth at 6 of the Clock, and so there is no Difference of Ascension, for he is then in the Aequinoctial, which cuts the Horizon in the two opposite points of East and West.</P>
<P>In this Question the Difference of Ascension is O P, and is a distance upon a line that goeth not through the Center, there∣fore take half the length of the parallel I D, and proceed as you did in the third Question, and after you have found it in degrees and minutes, convert it into hours and minutes of time, and set it down.</P>
<P>I find it to be here 16 <HI>deg.</HI> 18 <HI>min.</HI> which is 1 hour 5′ 3/15.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="question">
<HEAD><HI>QUESTION VII.</HI> For the time of the Suns Rising or Setting in this Example.</HEAD>
<P>I Consider as much as the Sun riseth before 6, so much he sets after 6: here he riseth before 6 of the Clock 1 hour 5′, sub∣tract that from 6 hours, and you have the hour of the Suns Ri∣sing 4 <HI>h.</HI> 55′: add it to 6 hours, and you have the time the Sun sets 7 <HI>h.</HI> 5′. double that, and it is the length of the whole day, which is here 14 <HI>deg.</HI> 10 <HI>min.</HI> Subtract the length of the<FIGURE>

<PB N="61" REF="36"/> day from 24 hours, and it leaves the length of the night 9 <HI>h.</HI> 50′. I omitted the Fractions.</P>
<P>But if the Sun riseth after 6 of the Clock, and you have a de∣sire to find these things (as he doth when he is South Declina∣tion) add the Difference of Ascension to 6 hours, and it gives the time of the Suns Rising; subtract it from 6, and it gives the time of Suns Setting; and that doubled is the length of the whole day. Again, that subtracted from 24 hours, is the length of the night.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="question">
<HEAD><HI>QUESTION VIII.</HI> To find the hour of the Suns being due East or West.</HEAD>
<P>THe Sun is due East (in this Example or any other) when he goeth by the East point of the Horizon; or West, when he goeth by the West point. In this Example, the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the East and West Azimuth in S, which is later in the morning than 6 of the Clock, by the distance S P: therefore see what S P is by <HI>The third way of Measuring,</HI> and convert it into time, and add it to 6 hours, it shall give the hour of the Suns being due East.</P>
<P>I find it in this Example to be 6 <HI>h.</HI> 46′.</P>
<P>Subtract this from 12 hours, and it gives the time of the Suns being due West that day: for as many hours and minutes as the Sun is due East before 12 of the Clock, so many hours and mi∣nutes must it be due West after 12: According to this Exam∣ple the Sun is due West at 5 of the Clock 14 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>If the Sun hath South Declination, he passeth the point of East before he riseth, and is set as long before he comes to the point of West, (provided the Latitude be Northerly, as this is) but if the Latitude and Declination be both one way, the Sun is always up before he cometh to the point of East: and the work is as I have shewed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>QUESTION IX.</HI> To find the time of Day breaking, and Twilight ending.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an antient Observation and concluded Opinion, That the Sun makes some shew of Day when he is 17 degrees under the Horizon; therefore take 17 <HI>deg.</HI> from your Scale of Chords and set it from both ends of the Horizon downwards, and draw the line T r, then fix your Compasses in r (the place where the Suns parallel of Declination intersects that line) and extend them to 6 of the Clock; set it off by <HI>The third way of Measuring,</HI> and convert it into time: Subtract that from 6 of the Clock, and it gives the time of Day breaking.</P>
<P>I find in this Example Day breaks at 3 of the Clock 6 <HI>min.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8/15.</P>
<P>Add it to 6 hours, and it gives the time of Twilight ending 8 of the Clock 3 53 14/13.</P>
<P>It may happen so sometimes, that it may be past 6 of the Clock before the Day breaks, in such a case you must add (in the mor∣ning) for break of Day, and subtract for Night from 6 hours, which is the contrary: These things your own Reason will give you, after you are used to it, which makes me forbear to give any more reasons of it.</P>

<PB N="63" REF="37"/>
<HEAD><HI>QUESTION XI.</HI> To find the Length of the longest Day in that Latitude.</HEAD>
<P>VVHen the Sun is nearest the Zenith (in any Latitude) that day must be the longest: now in places near the Aequi∣noctial, as between the Tropicks, there is but little difference all the year long; but in places nearer the Poles, there is more.</P>
<P>The Sun is nearest the Zenith in this Latitude, when he is in the Tropick of Cancer, so that then must be the longest Day. Imagine the Tripick of Cancer to be the parallel of the Suns Declination (as indeed it is that day) take the distance between Y and R, which is between Suns Rising and 6 of the Clock that day, and set it off by the <HI>Third way of Measuring,</HI> the number of degrees and minutes convert into time, and add it to 6 hours, which makes the length of the Forenoon, and that doubled is the length of the whole day (as in <HI>Quest.</HI> 7.) which is equal to the longest Night in that Latitude.</P>
<P>I find it here to be 16 hours 10 minutes.</P>
<P>Subtract the length of this longest day from 24 <HI>h.</HI> 00 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>And it leaves the length of the shortest night 7 <HI>h.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>Equal to which is the length of the shortest day 7 <HI>h.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>But you may measure the length of the shortest day, and sub∣tract that from 24 hours, and it will be the length of the longest night, which is equal to the longest day.</P>
<P>Now the shortest day is when the Sun is in the Tropick of Capricorn, for then it is latest before he riseth: Now to mea∣sure it, take the distance from 6 of the Clock, which is T, and the Suns Rising which is U, and set it off by the <HI>Third way of Measuring,</HI> convert the degrees into time, and subtract that time from 6 hours, it leaves the length of the Forenoon, which doubled is the length of the shortest day; (as in <HI>Quest.</HI> 7.) I have spoke to that purpose. I need say no more, that 7<SUP>th.</SUP> Question is light sufficient.</P>
<P>I might do an Example of what is before done, in a South Latitude, but Reason gives, that the same which the South Pole
<PB N="64" REF="38"/> or Southern parts of the Heavens are deprest in a Northern La∣titude, the same will the Northern parts of the Heavens be de∣prest in a Latitude as far Southerly, so that there will be no difference in the work at all: And indeed my desire to be brief, makes me omit things that I think may be understood without treating of them.</P>
<P>I'll only touch upon an Example in a Sphere which hath South Declination.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>Latitude Northerly</HI> 50 deg. 00 min. <HI>Declination</HI> 13 deg. 15 min. <HI>Southerly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Meridian Altitude of the Sun is his greatest height for that day H f, measured as before. The Suns Amplitude of Rising and Setting is V ♈, it is measured as before: But where∣as before it was to the Northwards of the East, now its to the<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="65" REF="38"/> Southwards; forasmuch as A is the North part of the Horizon, ♈ the East point of the Horizon (A ♈ being 8 points or 90 <HI>deg.</HI>) and so H is the South point: Now you see V is between the East ♈, and the South H.</P>
<P>Also, if you subtract this Amplitude V ♈ from ♈ H 90 <HI>deg.</HI> the remainder is the Suns Azimuth from the South V H, or if you add V ♈ to ♈ A (90 <HI>deg.</HI>) it is V A the Suns Azimuth of rising from the North; forasmuch as V A is as much above 90 <HI>deg.</HI> as V H wants of it: The same is to be understood in any Sphere, that the Amplitude and Azimuth of the Sun are Complements one of an other, to 90 <HI>deg.</HI> in that Quarter.</P>
<P>When the Suns Declination is Southerly (in any Northern Latitude) the days are not so long as the nights, so that the Sun cannot be up at 6 of the Clock, which is at R; therefore the Suns Azimuth at 6 of the Clock is of no use.</P>
<P>Neither is he up, when he passeth the East point of the Horizon, which is at P, so that you cannot take his height; but you may measure how far he is under the Horizon at either of those times, or you may find his true Azimuth at 6, which is of no value to us that are Seamen, because we cannot have a Magnetical Azimuth; they are measured as before.</P>
<P>The Difference of Ascension is here after 6 of the Clock, as much as it was before 6, in the last Example: And the rea∣son is, because the Latitude is the same, and the Declination of the Sun is just as far Southerly, as before it was Northerly, so that the Sun will now be just as long before he riseth after 6, as before he rose sooner: it is V R, take it off by the third way of Measuring, as you did before, and set it down; I find it to be 1 hour 5 <HI>min.</HI> 3/15, it serves for the same uses that it did in the other Example.</P>
<P>For the length of the day, subtract the Difference of As∣cension V R, from 6 hours, which is R f, and the remainder is f V, the length of the Forenoon, which doubled is the length of the whole day; that subtracted from 24 hours is the length of the night.</P>
<P>For the hour of the Suns being due East, it is P R, which is from the place where the Sun cuts the East and West Azimuth
<PB N="66" REF="39"/> to 6 of the Clock, and set it off by the third way of Measuring, convert your degrees and minutes into time, and subtract that time from 6 hours, and it gives the due time of the Morning that the Sun cuts the East point of the Compass; the reason why you subtract is, because the Sun is due East so long before 6 of the Clock.</P>
<P>Subtract the hour of the Suns being due East from 12 hours, and it will give the true time of the Suns being due West.</P>
<P>For the time of day breaking, draw the line 17 ⊙, parallel to the Horizon, and 17 <HI>deg.</HI> under it, as was shewed before, and mea∣sure from P to R, that is, from the place where the Suns Paral∣lel of Declination cuts that Circle of 17 <HI>deg.</HI> (under the Hori∣zon) to 6 of the Clock, convert it into time, and subtract it from 6 of the Clock, and it leaves the time of Day breaking, namely, the time in the morning that the Sun is in P; you subtract, because the day breaks so long before 6 of the Clock: If it where so that the Sun were in the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> you must take the Distance S q. You see the Sun is past the hour of 6 before it is break of day; now in this case you must add, whereas before you subtracted.</P>
<P>For the continuance of Twilight, it is measured as before, from the place, where the Parallel of the Suns Declination cuts the Circle of 17 <HI>deg.</HI> to the place where it cuts the Horizon; convert it into time, and set it down. In this Example it is P V.</P>

<P>BEfore we can find the Suns place in the Ecliptick, you are to consider that the Ecliptick is divided into 12 equal parts, by the 12 Signs; six of these Signs divide that half of the Eclip∣tick, which is to the Northwards of the Aequinoctial, and are called Northern Signs; and the other 6 divide the half that is to the Southwaads of the Aequinoctial, and are called Southern Signs, as I have set them down in this Book before, with their Names and Months to their Characters, and have set the
<PB N="67" REF="39"/> Northern Signs by themselves, and the Southern Signs by them∣selves.</P>
<P>It is plain then that these Signs must be of an equal Distance one from the other round about; and because 12 times 30 is 360, the Signs must stand 30 <HI>deg.</HI> asunder, and that will just do it: Now in this plain Body, half the Ecliptick is represent∣ed by a streight line that goes through the Center of the Sphere. The line of Signs is taken off, so that 90 <HI>deg.</HI> is but ♈ ♋; there∣fore<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> by a line of Sines you may take first 30 <HI>deg.</HI> and six one foot of your Compasses in ♈ (the Center) and with the other describe ♉ ♓, and their opposite Signs ♏ ♍; then take 60 degrees for ♊ ♒, and their opposite: Then take 90 <HI>deg.</HI> which
<PB N="68" REF="40"/> reach to the Circumference ♋ ♑, which is (from the Center) thus set off by a line of Sines; but if you have none but a line of Chords, you must take the Chord of 30 from your Scale first, and lessen it to a Sine thus, Fix one foot of your Com∣passes in the Meridian where the other foot (with that Distance) may sweep a line that goeth through the Center, as R t; keep your Foot in R, and extend your Compasses to U, and so you have R U the Chord of the Sine R t, apply it to your line of Chords, and you have your desire.</P>
<P>This plain Superficies can shew but one part of the Globous Body, but you must know it is round, which makes the Ecliptick to be divided; on both sides from ♈ to ♋ is 90 <HI>deg.</HI> from ♋ to ♎ is 90 <HI>deg.</HI> from ♎ to ♑ is 90 <HI>deg.</HI> and from ♑ to ♈ is 90 <HI>deg.</HI> every one of these quarters containing 3 Signs.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Ecliptick being thus divided into Signs; we may find the Suns place, and right Ascension.</HEAD>
<P>THe Suns place in the Ecliptick is the nearest Distance between the next Aequinoctial point, and the Sun in the Ecliptick, (by Aequinoctial points is meant ♈ and ♎, the two points of intersection that the Aequinoctial and the Ecliptick make) Now, in this case, the Sun must be nearest the Equinoctial point at ♈, because the Month is belonging to a Sign nearer ♈ than ♎.</P>
<P>Therefore, fix your Compasses in the point of ♈, and extend the other foot to the Sun in the Ecliptick, which is I, and apply it to the line of Sines; or if you have no line of Sines, convert it to a Chord (by the second way of Measuring) and as many degrees as it is, so far is the Sun distant from the nearest Aequi∣noctial point; if it exceed 30 <HI>deg.</HI> the Sun must be in that de∣gree of ♉ that is above 30 <HI>deg.</HI> if it exceed 60 <HI>deg.</HI> the Sun must be in that degree of ♊ above 60; but here I find it in less than 30, namely, 29 <HI>deg.</HI> 3 <HI>min.</HI> therefore I conclude the Sun is in 20 <HI>deg.</HI> 3 <HI>min.</HI> of ♈.</P>
<P>But suppose it were time of year that the Sun were return∣ing from the Tropick towards the Aequinoctial, and were the same Declination, then would the Suns place be the same from
<PB N="69" REF="40"/> entring into ♎, that it now is in ♈, namely, in 57 <HI>min.</HI> of ♍, which wants 29 <HI>deg.</HI> 3 <HI>min.</HI> of entring into ♎. Thus much for the Suns place.</P>
<P>The Suns right Ascension is measured from the place where the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the Ecliptick to 6 of the Clock, which is I 6; set it off by the third way of Measuring to extend it to a Great Circle: for the Sine of I 6 is equal to the Sine of S ♈; when you have measured it, convert it into time, and set it down; I find it to be 1 hour 44 <HI>min.</HI></P>

<P>Admit I set from the <HI>Lizard,</HI> lying in the Latitude of <HI>50 deg.</HI> and sail <HI>S W b W,</HI> till I alter my Latitude <HI>1</HI> degree or <HI>60</HI> miles: I demand my Distance run, and Departure from the Meridian.</P>

<P>IN this Question we have the Course 5 points from the Me∣ridian towards the West, which is 5 times 11 <HI>deg.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI> or 56 <HI>deg.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI> for 5 times 15 <HI>min.</HI> is 75 <HI>min.</HI> or 1 <HI>deg.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI> and 5 times 11 <HI>deg.</HI> is 55 <HI>deg.</HI> to which add the 1 <HI>deg.</HI> and 15 <HI>min.</HI> and the whole is 56 <HI>deg.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>To protract this Question or any other of this nature, I wish you to observe the end of your Book, that lies from you to be the North part of your Book, then that to the right hand will be the East part, that to the left hand the West, and that right to you the South part: The Reason why I wish you to observe this Method, is, that so in any Travis you may set every Angle the right way, which must be observed then, and is good to be always used.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="42"/>
<P>First draw the South line B D, let B be the <HI>Lizard,</HI> then set off from B 60 miles upon the South line (taking it from a Scale of equal parts) which is your Southing B D. Forasmuch then as B D is the Difference of Latitude that I have made since I set from B, D must stand in the parallel that I am in; and be∣cause I have sailed to the Westwards of the Meridian D B, I<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> will raise a Perpendicular which is a West line from D, and draw it at length, which is D A. This done, take an Arch of 60 <HI>deg.</HI> from your Scale of Chords, and (making the place you set from, the Center) describe the Arch D O, and upon it set off 56 <HI>deg.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI> which is D O 5 points; then by B and O draw the sine B O, till it intersect the line A D, which it doth in A: Now Forasmuch as D A is parallel in the Latitude the Ship was in after her sailing, and D B A an Angle of the Course from the Meridian, B A must intersect the West line in the place where the Ship is; then the Distance run is B A, and the Departure from the Meridian is D A, which take off severally, and apply to the Scale of equal parts, and set down what they come to: Here I find them as followeth:

<P>If Radius be not in the first place, you must take the Comple∣ment arithmetical of the first number, as here I have done; but if Radius be in the first place, take no Complement arith∣metical at all: The Complement arithmetical of a number is what every single figure wants of 9, take them in their due places, as here the Sine in the Tables answering to A 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 45 <HI>min.</HI> (which is the Sine Complement of B 56 <HI>deg.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI>) is 9,74473, whereas I have set it down 0,25526, now if you compare them, the number that I have taken is what the figures in the other want of 9, as 9 wants 0, and 7 wants 2, and 4
<PB N="75" REF="43"/> wants 5, and so forward; after the Complement arithmetical of the first number is taken, take the others as they be in the Tables, and add them together, casting away Radius always, and look for what comes out, either in the Sines, Tangents, or Logarithms, according as the order requires into which the pro∣portion runs. You see here I took no notice of Radius, which is a casting of him away: in like manner if the things added up come to above Radius, always cast Radius away, and set down what is above Radius; as here the last came out to be 11, and I cast away the 10, and set down 1.</P>

<P>But I have been often asked by them that I have learned, why I contradict the Rule, which saith, that the Sine of every Angle is proportional to its opposite side or the contrary. Now here you say, as Sine compl. B to B D, either you are false, or else the Sine comp. of B is the Sine of A, for A is the Angle oppo∣site to B D, whose Sine the Rule orders you to take.</P>
<P>I answer that A is the Complement of B, for this is certain, that the three Angles of any right lined Triangle consists of a Semicircle or 180 <HI>deg.</HI> and neither more nor less: Now if it be so, B A D and D B A must together be but 90 <HI>deg.</HI> because B D A is 90 <HI>deg.</HI> it self; then if B is 56 <HI>deg.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI> the Sine comp. of it must be the Sine of 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 45 <HI>min.</HI> which is the Sine of A, opposite to B D.</P>
<P>But you will ask how you should know that the three Angles of a right lined Triangle is but 180 <HI>deg.</HI> Pray mind this De∣monstration.</P>
<P>In the right angled Triangle A B C, the Angle that is con∣tained between the Perpendicular and the Base (which is A B and B C) is always a right Angle, or 90 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> or 8 points
<PB N="76" REF="44"/> of the Compass, which is B:<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>

<P>Set your Compass at any convenient distance, and from every angular point as a Cen∣ter, describe an Arch, as I O, U n, and s D; now I D is an Arch of 90 <HI>deg.</HI> 0. <HI>min.</HI> because it is included between two sides that are perpendicular one to the other; then U n and s O together are equal to I D; measure them, and set them upon the Arch I D, and they will be equal to it. From hence then it is evident, that s O and U n, or the two Angles beside the right Angle of any right angled Triangle, are Complements one of the other to 90 <HI>deg.</HI> or that the three Angles of any right lined Triangle are 180 <HI>deg.</HI> or two right Angles or a Semicircle.</P>

<P>FIrst draw the North and South line A D at length: Let A be the place in the Latitude of 50 <HI>deg.</HI> take the Difference of Latitude 90 miles from the Scale of equal parts, and set it off North from A, which falls at D: Now because D is as far to
<PB N="81" REF="46"/> the Northwards of A, as the Difference of Latitude which you made from A is, therefore if you draw the West line D B at length, it must cut through the place where the Ship is: I look upon the Question again, and I find that the Distance run since the Ship set out is 108 miles; take 108 miles from the Scale of equal parts; and because the Ship set from A,<FIGURE>

<P>You may ask the reason why the Course is not 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 45 <HI>min.</HI> as it was first given to be: I answer, because of the part of an unite, that the Difference of Latitude was set down more than it should be; for if you observe, I said it was almost 90 miles, when I found it before: Now the error is not worth minding in Sailing, for the Difference that the Fraction causeth is but 12. <HI>min.</HI> of a degree of a point of the Compass, which is no more than the 56<SUP>th.</SUP> part of a point.</P>
<P>If you mind, I have worked the Course thus found, and it doth not alter the Difference of Longitude or Departure (which should be 60 miles, if I had worked to the least Fraction) for the Logarithm here is nearest to the Logarithm of 60 in the Tables: Indeed I worked on purpose thus, because those that I have taught, when they could not find it come out right as the other was, could not tell where the fault lay; now this will direct them to know that some part of a unite missing in the find∣ing of the Sides, may make some minutes Difference in the Course: But now, here in the following Examples we will work to a Fraction, namely, to the 10<SUP>th.</SUP> or 100<SUP>th.</SUP> part of a unite, (in the sides) to shew how it is done; though in Sailing if you work to half an unite, it is near enough, or for any ordinary uses (and that the Tables give) and most commonly to less.</P>

<P>But instead of taking the Logarithm answering to the number here, take the Logarithm answering to ten times the number, and so you shall always have your sides come out to the tenth part of a unite; I say it will come out in tenths, for you must divide by 10, to bring it into miles after it is done.</P>
<P>Now instead of multiplying your given sides by 10, do but set a Cipher more to the number and it is done, as now for 60 set down 600, which is ten times 60; for 108 set down 1080, which is ten times 108; and thus for any number that will be comprehended in the Radius of the Tables.</P>

<P>Divide these tens by 10, and it gives the miles con∣tained <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> in the side D A the Difference of Latitude, which is 89 miles 8 tenths of a mile, whereas before it was 90 miles, whis is 2 tenths of a mile more: Now when you have the sides thus found in tenths or Centisms; work for the Angles, and you will find them to come out roundly alike: But if you desire more exactness, work then in Centisms, pro∣vided, that the numbers in Centisms do not out-run the Tables.</P>
<P>A Centism is the hundredth part of an unite, or of any thing; and if I would put the number 60 into Centisms, I will set two Ciphers behind it, and it is the same as before; I multi∣plied
<PB N="85" REF="48"/> 60 by 100, for it is 6000, the like is to be understood of any other number.</P>
<P>I would work to the nearest Fraction for the Angles here, but I conceive it to be no way beneficial, and therefore I'll refer it to the work of the Sphere, where it is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch more use; this finds the Angles to a minute, which is near enough.</P>
<P>It is like that some will be so curious, that this way of finding things to the tenth or hundredth part of unit will not suffice them, but they would have the real number answering to the Logarithm to the 1000<SUP>th.</SUP> part of a unite; because I find it of no real consideration or use in Navigation, I omit that here, and desire such to look in Book 1. Page 11. of my Fathers <HI>Tri∣gonometry,</HI> and there it is plainly shewed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>By the Plain Scale.</HEAD>
<P>This Question differs nothing from the other in its operation, only as you work in the other from a North and South line, here you work from an East and West line; The work is this.</P>
<P>First, draw an East and West line, and from the west end of it, set off your Departure from the Meridian, which is from D to B 60 miles; from D raise the Perpendicular D A (which is a North and South line) and draw it at length; then take the Distance run 108 miles, and fix one foot of your Compasses in B, with the other cut the Meridian line D A, which it doth in A. Draw the side A B: then is B the place your Ship is at after her Sailing, A is the place of her setting out, A D is the Dif∣ference of Latitude and N O s is an Arch of 60 <HI>deg.</HI> from the Angle D A B (as a Center) the measure of N O is the Course, and is performed as before in the last Example; and also of the Difference of Latitude as in other Examples.</P>
<P>The Difference of Latitude is D B 90 miles.</P>
<P>The Course is North 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 45 <HI>min.</HI> Easterly, D A B or N O.</P>
<P>The Plain Scale of equal parts will not resolve to the least Fra∣ction as the Tables will now to a tenth part of a mile, I confess a good Diagonal Scale will produce things to a small Fraction.</P>
<P>If you would know what Latitude you are in, divide 90 by 60, and the Quotient will be degrees, namely, 1 <HI>deg.</HI> the Re∣mainder
<PB N="86" REF="49"/> minutes, namely 30 <HI>min.</HI> Now because your Latitude was Northerly, and you have gone to the Northwards, you have increased it 1 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> so that you must add the Dif∣ference of Latitude to 50 <HI>deg.</HI> and it makes 51 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> if you have gone to the Southwards, you must have subtracted.</P>

<HEAD>By Proposition.</HEAD>
<P>The Rule that we have used for resolving all the Questions hitherto laid down was this.</P>
<P><HI>That the Sine of every Angle is proportional to its opposite Side, or every Side is proportional to the Sine of its opposite Angle:</HI> and this served where you had opposite things given, but here you have two sides, and an Angle between them given, so that you have nothing opposite to any of them, therefore that general Rule is of no value here in this case; this is a general Rule for this case, That, As the Sum of the two given Sides is to their Dif∣ference; So is the Tangent of the half Sum opposite Angles, To the Tangent of the Difference of either of them: That is, as the Sum of D B and D A together, is to their Difference, So is the Tangent of the half of A and B, to the Tangent of their Difference. Which Angle added to the half Sum makes the greatest, or subtracted from the half Sum it makes the least Angle. But this Rule though it be rare and true, yet in right angled Triangles we have a briefer way, which we will use, and leave this till we come to Oblique Triangles, as a place fitter for it: I only named it here, because I would give notice that my Father in saying all, he means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for he saith (Axiom 3. Book 1.) <HI>All plain Triangles,</HI> &amp;c. The reason why this Rule is not so good here, is this, if you subtract the Right Angle which is here always known from 180 <HI>deg.</HI> the Remainder is 90 <HI>deg.</HI> the Sum of the unknown Angles together, the half of which is 45 <HI>deg.</HI> now 45 <HI>deg.</HI> is the Radius of a Tangent, which is in∣different whether you take it or no, for it must be cast away in your work: and therefore if you only take the Logarithm an∣swering to the Sum of the two Sides comp. arith. and the Loga∣rithm of the Difference of them and add them together, they will produce this Angle of the Difference, which added to 45 <HI>deg.</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="50"/> is the greater or subtracted is the lesser; but which is better, you may do it with less trouble this way. Say for the Course,</P>

<P>Admit I set from the Latitude of <HI>50 deg.</HI> and sail upon some Point between the South and the West, till I come into the Latitude of <HI>49 deg. 0</HI> min. (by Observation.)

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN this case (because it would take up more room than my Book would hold) I'll make every 10 upon my Scale of
<PB N="90" REF="51"/> equal parts 20, then every one of the small divisions will be 2. For the protracting of it Geometrically, first draw the North and South line B R at length, and upon it set off your Diffe∣rence of Latitude, which is D B, make B the place of your Ships setting out, because it is the Northermost Latitude, and your Difference of Latitude is Southerly, raise a Perpendicular (or<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> East and West line) from D, and it must cut through the place where the Ship is; because she is in that Parallel or Latitude: upon this East and West line, from D set the Distance run, and Departure together, which is 197 miles 8/10, and it reacheth to E: by E and B draw the line E B, and divide it into two equal parts by a Perpendicular (you see it is a Perpendicular by the Arches h I and f g) draw it from P, till it cuts the Parallel E D, which it doth in A; from A then draw a line to the place you proposed to your self the Ship set from, which is B; now the length of that line, namely, A B, shall be the Distance run, and A D the Departure from the Meridian.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Demonstration.</HEAD>
<P>B E is divided into two equal parts in P, then E P and P B must be equal, P A is a Perpendicular to E P and B P, then
<PB N="91" REF="51"/> must A B and A E be equal, because the Perpendicular P A serves for them both, and their Bases, or the sides E P and P B are equal, as was said before.</P>
<P>It is evident then, that B A and A D are equal to E D, for if E A added to A D makes E D, A B which is equal to A E, ad∣ded to A D must be the same: and thus A B is the Distance run, and A D the Difference of Longitude or Departure from the Meridian, measure them as before; also from B as a Center, describe the Arch of 60 <HI>deg.</HI> S N, and extend the Sides A B and B R to it, and measure the Angle of the Course A B D (as be∣fore) whose measure is N s, And thus much for the Geometri∣cal way of working and demonstrating.</P>

<PB N="94" REF="53"/> Latitude is Southerly, and therefore you must cast it into de∣grees and minutes, and subtract it from 32 <HI>deg.</HI> 20 <HI>min.</HI> (your first Latitude) and the Remainder is the Latitude you are in; whereas if you had been in a Southern Latitude, and had differed your Latitude farther Southerly, you must have made your Latitude so much more, by adding your Difference of La∣titude, as here, if you had gone to the Northwards, you must have done so, to have known your increase of Latitude Norther∣ly: The like is to be understood in any case else of this nature. Here following I have answered the demands.</P>
<P>The departure from the first Meridian is F R 56 leagues.</P>
<P>The Course is the measure of the Arch s e O, which is E S E 9 <HI>deg.</HI> 8 <HI>min.</HI> Easterly.</P>
<P>The Distance that I am from the Port I set is A F 57 leagues.</P>

<P>And thus you see you sailed from A to C, and then altered your Course, and sailed from C to e, and then from E to F; the like is to be understood of any Travis else. And thus if you had a Travis of 24 hours, you might find what Distance your Ship is from the place she was the day before, and he other things, as Difference of Latitude, the Latitude you are in, the Depar∣ture, the Course made good upon a streight distance; so that you need not set down every thing to every alteration in your Reckoning which is endless and fruitless.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>By the Tables.</HEAD>
<P>To give an answer to the demands in the Travis, you need find nothing but the Difference of Latitude, and Departure that is made in every Angle and note which way it is, either North or South for Latitude; East or West for Longitude, and taking this notice after you have done, see which is greatest, (in the Difference of Latitude) either the Northing or Southing, or for Longitude the Easting or Westing, and that which is greatest, that way it is, and so much as it is above the other: We will shew an Example of this, when we have wrought the Travis.</P>

<P>FRom what hath been already shewed, you understand, that if the Latitude of two places be known, and the Difference of Longitude between them, you may find the bearing of them one from the other, their distance asunder, or any thing you desire; and this is all so plain, that if I set from a place, and am bound to a place, whose Latitude is known, and the difference of Longitude also known between them, and keep a reckoning of the departure both East and West that I make, setting them down in two di∣stinct Columns; it is but subtracting one from the other, and the remainder will be the East or West Longitude that I have made, (that of the two which was most,) also, if I know what Latitude I am in, and what Latitude the place lies in, it is but subtracting the lesser from the greater, and the remainder will be the difference of Latitude between your ship and that place (provided the Latitudes be both one way.) Also, subtract the Difference of Longitude that you have made, (provided that it be that way which shortens your Longitude between the place you set from, and are bound to,) from the whole difference of Longitude between the two places, and the remainder will be what is still between you and the place you are bound to: but if your departure which you have made, hath increased the difference of Longitude between the place you set from, and are bound to, add the remainder (after your subtracting the Columns one from the other) to the whole difference of Longitude be∣tween the places; the like for Latitude.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="example">
<HEAD><PB N="98" REF="55"/><HI>Example in the</HI> Reckoning <HI>following.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Suppose the Island of <HI>Ditiatha</HI> lies so, that it hath been found to have 950 Leagues departure West, from the Meridian of the <HI>Lizard</HI> (according to the Courses that be ordinarily sailed by <HI>Plano</HI>) the Latitude of it is 16 <HI>deg.</HI> 16 <HI>min.</HI> North Latitude, the <HI>Lizard</HI> lies in the Latitude of 50 <HI>deg.</HI> 00 <HI>min.</HI> Now upon some Occasion that fell in the term of our Voyage, namely, the 29th. of <HI>January</HI> on <HI>Tuesday,</HI> the Captain demands of me, what Di∣stance <HI>Ditiatha</HI> was from me by <HI>Plano,</HI> how it bears, what Lea∣gues of Departure I have to it, and the like: I look in my Reckoning, and I find in the West Column 434 Leagues, I look in the East Column and see 60 Leagues; I subtract 60 (my whole East Column) from 434 (the whole West Column) and the Remainder is 374 Leagues; which signifieth the Ship hath de∣parted from the Meridian of the <HI>Lizard</HI> 374 Leagues West; for the West Column was greatest.</P>
<P>Subtract this West departure 374 Leagues, from 950 the whole Departure, and I find there is still wanting 576 Leagues; This 576 Leagues is the Departure that is from the Meridian that my Ship is in, and <HI>Ditiatha.</HI></P>
<P>Subtract also the Latitudes one from the other, (namely, the Latitude your Ship is in, and the Latitude of <HI>Ditiatha</HI>) and the Remainder is the Difference of Latitude in degrees and minutes between the Ship and the Place you are bound to, which in this Example I find to be 6 degrees 24 minutes. Take the Latitude out of the Column of Latitude for that day in the Reckoning, and you will find it so, if you subtract 16 <HI>deg</HI> 16 <HI>min.</HI> from it.</P>
<P>Thus you have the Difference of Latitude between you, that day, and your Port, and the Departure that the Port hath from the Meridian that you are in that day, given you to find the things demanded; I will not work it, for it hath beeen shewed sufficiently already.</P>
<P>I have here following set down a Reckoning, and afterwards how I work it, and lastly the reason that makes me use this way of keeping my whole Reckoning in the last line, so that I am not troubled to add it up, when I give account of it.</P>

<P>Again, the next day at noon, I work my Ships Travis, as hath been shewed, and I find that she hath departed from the Meri∣dian she was in yesterday 38 Leagues West, which I add to what I had before, which was 21, and it makes 59 Leagues; and thus I go forwards, adding my last days departure in its true Column to all the rest, (which is in one sum) and by this means the last line is the whole Reckoning.

<P>In the East Column I set Ciphers to fill it up, till I have some East departure to put in it, and as that increaseth, so I add it (as the other) every day.</P>
<P>Also, I carry the West departure along in its full number of Leagues in the same line, without increase or decrease, till such time as I have more to increase it, and then I increase that, and carry the whole Easting with it in the same line: and thus you have need to look upon nothing, but the last line, to resolve you any thing that you desire, either of your course made good since you set out, your distance upon a straight line that you have failed, your Ports bearing from you, what departure is yet be∣tween

<P>I commonly set down the Easting or Westing between the place I set and the place I am bound to at the beginning of my reckoning, as also the Latitude of each place, as I have done here. You may ask why I do not set down the course that I made good every day: indeed that is not unnecessary, but the reason why I omit it is, First, because I find it of little use in my Reckoning; and secondly, I find it can be better expressed in a Journal which is kept with my Reckoning; and indeed there I set it with the Winds, and the reasons for steering upon such Courses: but I leave every one to their own Judgment for that, as also for Distances and Winds, for Difference and Variation.</P>
<P>It would have been necessary here to have set down some Ta∣bles to have worked Triangles by, for (as I have said) sometimes in 24 hours you have a Travis of 4 or 5 several courses, and to work them this way may seem tedious.

<HEAD><HI>CONCERNING</HI> the <HI>VARIATION</HI> OF THE COMPASS.</HEAD>
<P>THere is always two things given to find the Variation of the Compass; that is, the true Amplitude of the Suns rising, and the Magnetical Amplitude of the Suns rising or setting: the true Amplitude of the Suns rising, is, (as I have said before in another place) the true and absolute quantity of degrees, that the Sun riseth from the East, (either Northwards or Southwards) or sets from the West, and is found (as I have before shewed) in the use of the Sphere.</P>
<P>The Magnetical Amplitude of the Sun, is what the Sun riseth from the East, or sets from the West by the Compass: Now be∣cause the first gives the Truth how far the Sun riseth from the East, or sets from the West; therefore whatsoever difference there is between them, so much is the variation.</P>
<P>As now, Suppose I find in a certain Latitude such a day of the Month (by the Sphere) that the Sun riseth to the Northwards of the East 17 degrees; that is, the true Amplitude: but I observe the Sun at her Rising, with an Azimuth Compass (which is made for that purpose) and find that she riseth but East 10 degrees Northerly; then I conclude the Variation is 7 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> or the Compass is false so much; so that whereas if I direct my Course East 10 degrees Northerly by the Compass, I do not go on that Course, but I go East and by North 5 <HI>deg.</HI> 45 <HI>min.</HI> Northerly, which is just 7 <HI>d.</HI> from my expectation, or East 17 <HI>deg.</HI> Northerly,
<PB N="103" REF="57"/> the true Amplitude. Now that is a gross error, and in long runs may deceive a man much, and perhaps be a means to lose a Ship, when one little thinks of it; and therefore it ought to be looked to.</P>
<P>An Azimuth Compass is no other in effect, but a Compass fitted for the exact taking of the Sun at her Rising or Setting, or upon other certain times of the day, as you may have occasion.</P>
<P>In like manner you may find the Variation of the Compass at other times, by taking the Suns Azimuth at any time of the day.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="example">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Suppose I were in the Latitude of</HI> 33 deg. 20 min. <HI>Northerly, and upon the</HI> 8<SUP>th.</SUP> <HI>day of</HI> November <HI>the Suns Declination is Southerly</HI> 19 deg. 20 min. <HI>I demand the Suns Azimuth at</HI> 8 <HI>of the Clock.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The Suns Azimuth at her Rising (as I have shewed) is the Complement of the Suns Amplitude; but after the Sun is up, it may be also the Distance of the Sun from the East and West Azimuth: Now in this Proposition, you de∣sire to know how many Degrees the Sun is from the East and West Azimuth, (which is that Part of the Heavens that is distant from the Sun) parallel to the Horizon over the East Point of it; or if it had been at 4 of the Clock in the Afternoon, it would have been required from the West Point.</P>
<P>For the resolving this Question project a Sphere (as hath been taught) for the Latitude proposed, with the Parallel of the Suns Declination drawn as it is given: Divide this Parallel of Declination into the hours of the day from 6 to 12, or which serves from 12 to 6 in the Afternoon; the way to divide it is thus; From 6 of the Clock set off 15 degrees by the third way of measuring, which will be 7, then (because 30 de∣grees is two hours in time) next set off 30 degrees by the third way of Measuring from 6, and it makes 8 a Clock; then take
<PB N="104" REF="58"/> 45 <HI>deg.</HI> which is three hours, and it makes 9 a Clock, then 60 <HI>deg.</HI> for 10 a Clock, then 75 <HI>deg.</HI> for 11 a Clock, and then 90 <HI>deg.</HI> which will just fall in the place where the Sun comes to the Meridian for 12 a Clock. Thus you divide the Parallel of the Suns Declination into hours, as you may see in the Sphere here following: it being thus divided, the Suns Azi∣muth at 8 of the Clock is 8 s, taken off by the third way of Measuring, I find it to be 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> (by the Scale) so it is certain that the Sun should be just 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> to the Southwards of the East at 8 of the Clock, then I will see how high he should be at that time, and I find him to be 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI> equal to s ♈, take off s ♈ by the second way of Measuring. I will observe the Sun till I find him at that height, and then I know it is 8 of the Clock; see by your Azimuth Compass whether he be 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> from the East or no, and if not, what it differs, so much is the Variation of the Compass.</P>
<P>I have wrought this Example no nearer than the plain Scale works it, which possibly may be 15 <HI>min.</HI> or half a de∣gree of the Compass out of the way, but that is no consi∣derable error in a Course, which is the thing we here use it for.</P>
<P>The same may be done at any time of the day, as La∣titude 32 <HI>deg.</HI> 20 <HI>min.</HI> North, Declination 19 <HI>deg.</HI> 20 <HI>min.</HI> South.</P>
<P>Suppose it were cloudy, but at some time the Sun breaks out, so that I have an opportunity to take his height with my Quadrant, and also his magnetical Azimuth with my Azimuth Compass: Now I find his height to be r t, equal to N P, and the Azimuth at that time is N t, it being drawn parallel to the Horizon; this N t set off by the third way of Measuring, and so much as it comes to, so much is the true Azimuth of the Sun from the East towards the South: Take your magnetical Azimuth at the same time, and as much as they differ, so much is the Variation: And thus much for the Variation of the Compass.</P>
<P>I have known some able men that have missed <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and I have observed that it hath been most commonly, when the
<PB N="105" REF="58"/>
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> Sun hath had North Declination, so far that he hath been to the Northwards of that Latitude. Now I suppose the reason of it may be this.</P>
<P>When a man observes the Sun with a Quadrant (which is our usual Instrument) he takes the upper edge, which is to the Northwards in this Latitude. Suppose then I set from the <HI>Lizard,</HI> and am bound to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> I make observations of the Sun as often as I can all the way, till I bring the Sun to the Zenith: after I pass the Zenith, the edge of the Sun that was highest is lowest: Now he that doth not consider this, loseth the
<PB N="106" REF="59"/> bredth or Diameter of the Sun, so that your observations may differ from your expectation 30 miles, which is enough to miss an Island; therefore I advise you always to allow the Suns Di∣ameter (which some count 30 <HI>min.</HI>) to every observation you make in places where the Sun is to the Northwards of you; that is, make your Meridian Altitude 30 <HI>min.</HI> less than it is, which is the Altitude of the lower edge, which was your upper edge before you crossed the Zenith, where the Sun was; or if you work your observations by the Complement of his height, make that 30 <HI>min.</HI> more.</P>
<P>I confess the best way would be at all times to subtract the Semidiameter of the Sun, which is 15 <HI>min.</HI> from your Meridian Altitude: But because the Latitude of Places are not set down with this consideration, it is more safe to do as before, unless you know otherwise by your own experience. This only by the by to give notice.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="example">
<HEAD>Example, for the laying open of this Error.</HEAD>
<P>Suppose I observe the Sun at <HI>Barbadoes</HI> the 11th. day of <HI>December,</HI> and I find that the Meridian Altitude of the Suns upper edge is 53 <HI>deg.</HI> 18 <HI>min.</HI> to which I add the Suns Declinati∣on for that day, which is Southerly 23 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> and it gives the height of the Aequinoctial above the Horizon of the Com∣plement of the Latitude to 90 degrees, which is 76 <HI>deg.</HI> 48 <HI>min.</HI> which subtracted from 90 degrees, leaves the Latitude or Aequi∣noctial's Distance from the Zenith, 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 12 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 11th. of <HI>June,</HI> I observe the Sun again in the same place, and I find the Meridian Altitude of the upper edge of the Sun is 80 <HI>deg.</HI> 12 <HI>min.</HI> (Note that this upper edge is opposite to the edge before, for the Suns Declination is 23 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> Northerly, which makes that the Sun gives a South Horizon) I add the Suns Declination to the Meridian Altitude, and it gives 103 <HI>deg.</HI> 42 <HI>min.</HI> the Distance between the Aequinoctial and the North Horizon, from which subtract 90 <HI>deg.</HI> and the remainder is the Aequinoctial's distance from the Zenith, or the Latitude which is 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 42 <HI>min.</HI> Now this Latitude should agree with the other, for the place stands still; but for want of
<PB N="107" REF="59"/> this subtracting the Semidiameter of the Sun, it differs 30 <HI>min.</HI> and when men meet with things thus at Sea, for want of minding of this they run 30 <HI>min.</HI> more Southerly than they should do, which I suppose may be the greatest reason of their missing this Island, and others that lie near the Aequinoctial; but for those places that lie far from the bounds of the Sun, it is not to be minded: Yet it were good (methinks) if all Places had been laid down with allowance for the Suns Semidiameter; but be∣cause they are not, you ought to be careful, when at any time you cross the Zenith of the Sun: I have not been my self in a time of year to cross the Suns Zenith, and therefore I only set this down by way of Caution to those that may.</P>

<P>MOst Plats have all the Points of the Compass drawn out from several Centers through the Plat, and be∣cause they are common, and the way to work by them so ordinarily known, I have thought it ne∣cessary to draw the manner of a Plat, and to shew its use that hath only Meridians and Parallels drawn in it, which is the Plat following.</P>
<P>Suppose then that I have a Plat that hath the Meridians and Parallels drawn to every fourth degree, as this following is. You see this Plat is divided into equal Squares throughout, by the Meridians and Parallels so drawn, also one of these Squares is divided into eight Points of the Compass, which is the Square E C D O, (the manner of dividing it we will shew anon.) Now if A where the <HI>Lizard,</HI> and B were the Island <HI>Madera,</HI> I demand their distance asunder. Let B A represent the edge of a Scale lying between them, take the Distance A B, and apply it to the Meri∣dian, and see how many degrees it reacheth, and convert them into miles, and it answers your desire.

<P>Imagine (as I said before) that A B were the edge of a Scale cutting upon the two places. Look for that Corner
<PB N="109" REF="60"/> that is nearest without the edge (which is S) fix one foot of your Compasses in S, and with the other sweep the edge of your Scale, which will be S G, keep fast your Scale, and from the Corner S run that foot of your Compasses (keeping it at the same Distance from the Scale by the other foot running by the edge of the Scale) till you come to the next side with it (which in this ex∣ample fails at F) then take the Distance E L, and apply it to the graduated Square, either from D or E, and as many points as it is there, so many Points doth the <HI>Lizard</HI> bear to the East∣wards of the North, from the <HI>Maderas,</HI> which is here two points and almost a quarter. The same will be done from a Corner farther from the Scale, and this is evident; for by the Flower de luys you see that S L is a North line from S, and a line drawn from S to F is parallel to B A, or runs upon the same point to the Eastwards of the North from S. Therefore whatsoever line S F is, the same is B A, the like is to be understood of any other example, as, suppose we had not found the bearing of the <HI>Lizard</HI> from the <HI>Maderas,</HI> and would find the bearing of the <HI>Maderas</HI> from the <HI>Lizard.</HI> Because my Scale runs no farther than B, I cannot use the Corner at S (which is nearest) and the rest are upon the graduated Meridian, therefore I will use the Corner at L, as I did the Corner at S; but because it is the contrary thing, I'll run the contrary way, namely from L to H, then is L H and F S parallel, and because S L is the Meridian to them both, therefore are H S and L F equal, so that if S H be applied to the graduated Square, it is as many points to the Westwards of the South, as L F is to the Eastwards of the North, therefore the <HI>Maderas</HI> bear from the <HI>Lizard</HI> South South-west almost a quarter of a point Westerly: if it had been from any other Corner, it would have been the same, the like for any other.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>For the Difference of Latitude between two Places.</HEAD>
<P>The Difference of Latitude between two places is taken af∣ter the same manner from a Parallel, as the Departure is from a Meridian Line; as suppose I would take the Difference of Latitude between X and (‖), first, take the nearest Distance between X and the Parallel that T is in, and see how much it is.

<P>To find what Latitude any place lies in, take the nearest Distance between that Place and the next Parallel with your Compasses, and look where that Parallel cuts the graduated Me∣ridian, and carry your Compasses with that distance there (one foot) and observe to set the other that way as the place is, either to the Northwards or Southwards of that Meridian, and see upon what degree and minute of a degree it falls, and that is the Lati∣tude of the place.</P>
<P>As, suppose I would know the Latitude of the North side of the <HI>Maderas,</HI> I will fix my Compasses, one foot in B, and extend the other to sweep the Parallel that S is in, that Distance I will carry
<PB N="111" REF="61"/> to the place were the Parallel cuts the graduated Meridian which is at 34, and fixing one foot there, I will see where the other falls to the Southwards towards L (because it is the Southwards of that Parallel) and I find it falls in the Latitude of 32 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> from whence I conclude, that the Northermost part of the <HI>Maderas</HI> lies in the Latitude of 32 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>The way that the Square E C D is divided into Points, is on this manner: First, I draw the line O C, then the other lines for half-points, and quarter-points, then I describe the Circles, making the outmost come to the innermost of the lines (but whether it be or no is no great matter) the Circles being divided into Points, half-points, and quarters, I lay my Scale by the Center of these Circles, which is O, and the divisions on the Circles, &amp; where my Scale cuts upon the outer line, from thence I draw my Points, half-points, and quarter-points, as you see here in the following Blank; and the Points upon the sides of the Square thus set off are the Tangents of the Points upon the Arch: for when from the outer∣most edge of an Arch a Perpendicular is raised from a side that bounds that Arch (as the side N 4 is,) and the other side that bounds the same Arch be extended without the Arch to intersect it (as the line O C intersects N 4 at 4,) that Perpendicular is the measure of that Arch, either in degrees or points; as here N W is 45 degrees or 4 points, and so is N 4.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SUch Questions as these are used in situating of places that are in sight one of the other; or, as a man sails by a land, he may take the Headlands bearing one from the other, and also the Imbays as well as the Head-lands, if he be not too far out.</P>
<P>This Question is wrought as the second Question, for here you have the bearing of the places you note in both Sta∣tions, and also the Course that you steer from one Station to the other, with the Distance; which is two Angles and a Side, to find the other two Sides, which is your Distance at each Station from the places.</P>
<P>For the protracting of this Question; from your first Sta∣tion draw a line upon those several Courses, as the Question saith the places bear; As, suppose the first Station be A, from A draw A I a N N E line, and (mind) that line must be cut upon the Eastermost Head-land, because the Question saith it bears so.</P>
<P>Next draw a N W line from A, which is A C, and cuts the the Westermost Head-land.</P>
<P>Lastly, draw out a South line from A, which is A D, and cuts the Island.</P>
<P>Then from A draw an East line (for the Course you steered) and set off 8 miles upon it, which is A R, from R draw a line to every place, as the Question saith they bear; Then (namely) from R to the Eastermost Head-land, draw
<PB N="128" REF="72"/> a N E b E line 5 <HI>deg.</HI> Easterly: from R to the Westermost Head-land draw a N N E line, and from R to the Island an E S E Course. Now because the lines drawn from each Station cut the Head-lands and Island; it is evident that the<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="129" REF="72"/> Point of their intersecting one another must be the places, (thus) A I and R I are the lines drawn upon the Course that lead from the Stations to the Eastermost Head-land, and cut in I, then is I the Headland. A O and R O are the Courses that lead to the Westermost Head-land from both Stations, and intersect in O, therefore O is the Westermost Head-land.</P>
<P>Lastly, A s and R s are the Courses that lead from the two Stations to the Island; and therefore s is the Island, for there they cut.</P>
<P>Draw a line from every one of them as from s to O, and from O to I, from I to s, and take the distance of them asunder; then for their bearing one from another, draw a North and South line from each place, and by an Arch of 60 <HI>deg.</HI> measure it, as hath been shewed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">

<P>First, I consider that I have the Distance between the two Stations, R A (which is a side of the triangles A R I, A R O, and A R s) and in every of these Triangles, the Question gives me all the Angles, so that I can find my Di∣stance from my Station to the Head-lands, after the form of this Example, which I shall do from each Station to the Eastermost.</P>

<P><HI>Two Ships make an Angle of </HI>50 deg.<HI> the one sails between the South and the West </HI>40<HI> leagues, the other sails between the South and the East </HI>50<HI> leagues, and at the end of their sailing, the Eastermost Ship is more Southerly than the Westermost, so that they differ their Latitude </HI>15<HI> leagues; I demand each Ships Course, and their Distance asunder.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe place the Ship set from, I make to be B, take off 60 <HI>deg.</HI> from your Scale, and describe an Arch, making B your Center, as the Arch T R: then I take 50 <HI>deg.</HI> from my Scale, and set off somewhere upon that Arch, namely, from T to R, and from B, upon the Course that leads to T, I set off 40 leagues, my Westermost Ships Distance, and so conclude my Westermost Ship is at C: then from B upon the Course that leads to R, I set off my my Eastermost Ships Di∣stance run, which is 50 leagues from B to A. Lastly, draw A C, which is the Distance of the Ships at the end of their sailing.</P>
<P>Then because the Question saith the Eastermost Ship was 15 leagues more Southerly in Latitude, than the Westermost; I will take 15 leagues from the Scale of equal parts, and fix one foot of my Compasses in A, and with the other describe the Arch I S N, and draw the line from C, by the upper edge of the Circle at length, which must be an East and West line, because A is just 15 leagues to the Southwards of the nearest part of it: then let fall a Perpendicular from B upon C N, and extend it as far as the Arch of 60 <HI>deg.</HI> which you first de¦scribed
<PB N="132" REF="74"/> T R, and it cuts in O, this must be a South line from B, namely B S; then measure upon the Arch of 60 <HI>deg.</HI> from O to R, for the Eastermost Ships Course, and from O to T for the Westermost Ships Course, as you do in any other Question.

<P>If you add the sides now found all together, it will come to 2/10 of a unite less than the given sides together, in the Question is; now that ariseth by neglecting the taking of the absolute number, answering to the Logarithm that comes out; but this is sufficient in cases of this kind. If you had set it in paces, and wrought to the tenth part, you would have been out but 2/10 of a pace, therefore use your mind in such cases. If you had wrought to Centisms, you would have been nearer: but this I count near enough for sailing, and I am sure is more proper to be used, than such small Fractions, because no long distances can be guessed to a mile or a league. You might have wrought your last propor∣tion by the Rule of Three, as you did the other.</P>

<HEAD>QUESTION IX.</HEAD>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have applied this Question to sailing here, but before in this Book I have used it in a thing which is very proper for it; and indeed it may be of use many times, which makes me give it place here. I shall say nothing of this Question by the Plain Scale, for it is done, as before you see: but we will do it by the Tables of Tangents and Logarithms.</P>
<P>Here I have given the side M er 40 leagues, the side M W 50 leagues, and the Angle at M, namely, its Complement to 180 <HI>deg.</HI> R M er 78 <HI>deg.</HI> 45 <HI>min.</HI> to find the Angles M er W and M W er:

The Center is F here, the Triangle W F er and W M er have W er to both their Bases: then must B F A be double to I M O, or C B A double to D M I (that is to the Arch I O D) so that if you double D O I, 101 <HI>deg.</HI>

<HEAD>QUESTION X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>There was two Ships set from one Port, one sailed </HI>N W b N 6<HI> leagues a watch, the other sailed </HI>N E 8<HI> leagues a watch, these Ships arrived at two several Ports in one instant of time, the Ports were </HI>12<HI> leagues asunder: I demand the Distance run of each Ship, and the Ports bearing one from the other?</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOr the doing of this Question, First draw a N W b N line, and set off 6 leagues upon it which is A I; then draw a N E line, and set 8 leagues off upon it, which is A D; draw the side I D, then consider that as A I is to A D, so is the West∣ermost Ships run to the Eastermost; so that the sides A D and A I extended so far that a line of 12 leagues long, drawn parallel to D I, will just touch the extended sides which must cut them in the places were the Ports are, namely, A B in B, and A I in C: measure the sides C A and A B, and also the Angles of the Ports bearing A B C, or A C B and count them as hath been shewed before.</P>

<P>The reason that the proportion stands thus, is because the Angles are equal in each Triangle, and therefore the sides must be proportional.</P>
<PB N="146" REF="81" MS="y"/>
<P>Thus the Eastermost Ship sailed 10 7/10 leagues, the Wester∣most 8 leagues, and the Eastermost Port bears from the Wester∣most East 4 <HI>deg.</HI> 14 <HI>min.</HI> Northerly.</P>
<P>There is no Distance that a man sails, but if he returns the same way that he went out, he shall find the same Distance back∣wards as he did out.</P>
<P>But now, the World is round, and if a man goeth out one way, and returns another (as it is common) he will find a great deal of difference in long runs. For to demonstrate the reason of this I shall not, because my Father and others have done that sufficiently, besides, it would take up too much room in this little Book.</P>
<P>These Questions of Sailing may be understood in such cases as this is, namely, when a man sails the same way home as he doth out: But because the Winds will not suffer a man to do so, it is necessary to know some better way to sail by. Let a man return never so contrary to what he sailed outwards, yet at all times to know how near or how far he may be off.</P>
<P>Now there is no way better than <HI>Mercator</HI>'s way of Sailing, it is very excellent, and hath been treated of by many, and that makes me presume to think that I may treat of it as well as others. And first here are the Tables of Meridional Parts, by which you are to work.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration of the Table of <HI>MERIDIONAL PARTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THese Tables are in my Fathers Works to every six mi∣nutes, but here to every three minutes; so that if a man light not upon the very number that he desireth, he may the easier take it, for it will be but one third or two thirds of the Difference between the two nearest to be added or subtracted; I suppose it will be the less troublesom; I have gone no farther than sixty degrees, because I would not take up too much room, and I suppose there is but little Trading to the Northwards of that Latitude, so that it would have been sel∣dom in use, These Tables were calculated by my Fathers Tables.</P>
<P>He that sails according to <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Projection, notes the true Quantity of Longitude in degrees and minutes, namely, such degrees as in that Parallel, 360 makes the Circumference. But they which sail by <HI>Plano,</HI> measure the Sea, which is round, as though it were a flat or plain, now it stands to reason that there must be great Difference: as thus,</P>
<P>All North and South Courses (which we call Meridians) intersect in the Poles: Now suppose there be two Ships under the Aequinoctial, 5 degrees or 100 leagues asunder, and these Ships sail both North, they will meet in the North Pole of the World, but by <HI>Plane</HI> they count them as far off there, as they were at first, for all North and South Lines are parallel one to another, as you may see in the Work all along.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Illustration.</HEAD>
<P>All Meridian Lines (as I said before) cut through the Poles of the World, and all Parallel Lines go round about the Poles, continuing the same distance from them. The Aequinoctial is one of these Parallel Lines, drawn equally distant from the Poles, and so is upon the body of the Earth; and there a degree of Longitude is 60 miles, and 360 times 60 miles is the Circum∣ference of the Earth, which is 360 degrees.</P>
<PB N="159" REF="87"/>
<P>But now if there be a drawn Parallel, 50 degrees nearer to one of the Poles, our own reason will give that that Circle will not contain so many miles round as the other did, be∣cause it must be less; yet he that sails by <HI>Plano</HI> counts that it doth, and though he hath Winds that carry him no better than due North from the Aequinoctial to the Parallel or La∣titude of 50 degrees, he counts he hath as many Leagues from the Meridian of the Place he is bound to, as he had when he was under the Aequinoctial. Now tell me how it is possible, (if Meridians intersect in the Poles, as they do) that these Meridians should be as far asunder upon a Parallel of 50 de∣grees nearer the Poles, as they were under the Aequinoctial: I hope you understand me.</P>
<P>It is the work of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcator</HI> to shew (therefore) the Quan∣tity of a degree of Longitude in every Latitude, (for in these Parallels there is 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 degrees in the Circumference, but these degrees cannot contain so many miles as they do nearer the Aequator) It sheweth how you may sail upon any Course from one Latitude to another, and reckon your Longitude according to the truth of it in degrees and minutes: So that having two things given besides the right Angle, you may find your desire at Sea according to <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Direction, which is the surest way of Sailing that I know, except Sailing by the Arch of a great Circle, and that and this will agree in degrees of Longitude, but that sheweth the nearest way to sail from place to place, which is all that it differs from this, (they being both true) this sheweth a general way of sailing from place to place, that a particular way of sailing the nearest way from place to place: It is but seldom used, because it is not very commonly known, but it is an excellent thing, I thought to have touched it, but I considered that my Father hath demonstrated it as evidently as can be. For <HI>Mercator</HI> use the Tables here inserted.</P>

<P>Now you may ask a reason why this Difference of Longitude should differ from the other in the last Question, seeing the Difference of Latitude, Course and Distance in each Question are alike: the reason is, because this Question runs between two less parallels than the other did, and therefore the same things must give a greater part of this Parallel than it did of the other, though the number of miles of Departure be alike.</P>
<P>Divvide 2945 <HI>min.</HI> by 60, and you have the Difference of Lon∣gitude in degrees and minutes 49 <HI>deg.</HI> 5 <HI>min.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Is to Radius;</HI></P>
<P><HI>So is the Departure in miles</HI></P>

<HEAD>Concerning the foregoing Tables.</HEAD>
<P>HE that is bound to any place, the first thing that he ought to consider is the Latitude of each place, and the Diffe∣rence of Longitude between them, which things may be ta∣ken from such a Catalogue as this is, after the manner fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>Suppose I were bound from the <HI>Lizard</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> I look in the Column of Latitude against the <HI>Lizard,</HI> and find 50 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> for its Latitude, and 25 <HI>deg.</HI> 20 <HI>min.</HI> for its Longitude, from <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves.</HI></P>
<P>I look in the Column of Latitude against <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and find 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 12 <HI>min.</HI> for its Latitude, and 327 <HI>deg.</HI> 42 <HI>min.</HI> for its Longitude from <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves.</HI></P>
<P>Here you have the Latitude of each place; but to find the Difference of Longitude between these places, I consider that <HI>Barbadoes</HI> hath 327 <HI>deg.</HI> 42 min. of East Longitude from these Islands; but if I subtract that from 360 <HI>deg.</HI> (the whole Circum∣ference) there must remain the West Longitude that is between them, which I find to be 32 <HI>d</HI> 18 <HI>m.</HI></P>

<P>To it add the longitude between the <HI>Lizard</HI> and <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves</HI> 25 <HI>d.</HI> 20 <HI>m.</HI></P>
<P>That Sum is 57 <HI>d.</HI> 38 <HI>m.</HI></P>
<P>The Difference of Longitude between the <HI>Lizard</HI> and <HI>Barba∣does</HI> (the Meridian of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> being to the Westwards of the <HI>Lizard</HI> so many degrees.)</P>
<P>And thus any Difference of Longitude between two places is taken; provided, that one of them is nearer than 19 <HI>deg.</HI> to the Westwards of the place you begin your Longitude from, and the other nearer than 90 <HI>deg.</HI> to the Eastwards.</P>
<P>And the reason of this is, because the Longitude of all places is set down from <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves</HI> to the Eastwards; so that if a place were but 1 <HI>deg.</HI> to the Westwards of <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves,</HI> it would be set down in the Catalogue to lie in the 359 <HI>deg.</HI> of Longitude.</P>
<PB N="172" REF="94"/>
<P>For to know the Difference of Longitude between any two places, consider which way they are nearest, and that take: Suppose there were two places, one lieth in 20 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> of Longitude, the other lieth in 195 <HI>deg.</HI> of Longitude: I con∣sider that the difference between them is not 180 <HI>deg.</HI> and therefore I will subtract 20 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> from 195 <HI>deg.</HI> and the Remainder is the Difference of Longitude between them 175 <HI>deg.</HI> but if the Difference between two places be above 180 <HI>deg.</HI> as they are laid down in the Catalogue: Subtract that difference from 360 <HI>deg.</HI> and the Remainder is the nearest Dif∣ference of Longitude: Your own reason will guide you in this, and therefore I will proceed.</P>

<P>This 46 <HI>min.</HI> is East Longitude, and must be set down in the East Column: and let the West Column hold its Sum still, as was done in the plain Reckoning before, and when you come to increase your Westing again, carry your whole East Longitude along, and thus you have your whole Reckoning in the last line: The setting down of this differs nothing from the other; therefore to that I refer you.</P>
<P>Sometimes your Latitudes may be such, that the Tables do not answer them to a minute, (for they are but to every 3 <HI>min.</HI>) as suppose the one Latitude were 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 20 <HI>min.</HI> the other 15 <HI>deg.</HI> 16 <HI>min.</HI> and I would take the Meridional part contained between them.</P>

<P>Thus I have the two Latitudes, and the Difference of Longi∣tude, to find the bearing of the place I am bound to: You may find it as is shewed before, <HI>Quest.</HI> 4. by bringing your Diffe∣rence of Longitude into minutes, and taking the Meridional parts contained between the Latitude you are now in, and the Lati∣tude of <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> and using them as the sides to work by.</P>
<PB N="178" REF="97"/>
<P>If you have a mind to know your Distance (upon the Course) to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> see what Difference of Latitude is between the Latitude you are in, and the Latitude of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> reduce it into miles, and say,
<Q><L>As Sine comp. the Course</L>
<L>To the Difference of Latitude,</L>
<L>So is Radius</L>
<L>To the Distance.</L></Q></P>
<P>And thus in brief you are able to give an account of your whole Reckoning at any time, or of any part of your Reckon∣ing, if the day be given. The like you may do for the Course that was steered from day to day; but that (as I shewed before) ought to be taken notice of in a Journal, or if you like it better make a Column for it in your Reckoning. The reason why I re∣fer that and the Winds and Variation, is, because it can better be expressed with the reasons of it than here.</P>
<P>Those days that you observe, correct your Reckoning by your Observations, as my Father sheweth in his practice after the Tables.</P>
<P>I had thoughts to have projected a Chart after the manner of <HI>Mercator,</HI> but because few of them are made true, I forbear, and advise none to trust them, except they are able to examine them.</P>
<P>If I have been too tedious either in this, or any thing else, remember this is but the buds of my beginnings, and hereafter I may learn to comprise a great matter (more plainly) under fewer words, which is most docible.</P>

<HEAD>OF ASTRONOMY.</HEAD>
<P>I Had thoughts to have handled the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles fully, but if I should, I might do that which my Father hath done before, better than I can; the thing which induced me to this thought was that I might make the Application of it to Great Circle sailing; but because that way of sailing (though the best) is seldom used, I have not set it in my Book; if you desire to know it, you may see the way of it in my Fathers works, as plainly as (I think) it can possibly be demonstrated by any man.</P>
<P>I have thought good to make use of his fundamental Axiom, to shew how to resolve those Questions in the Sphere, which I have wrought in this Book by the Plain Scale, though I confess (for Amplitudes of Rising and Setting, and Azimuths at certain given hours, with divers other things that are chiefly to be minded at Sea, for the Variation of the Compass, and other necessary uses) I hold the Plain Scale to be true enough, but that I conceive not to be so satisfactory to all men, and there∣fore I have done this, the Axiom is this:
<Q>The Sine of a middle part with Radius, is equal to the Tangents of the Extremes adjacent, or to the Sine Complement of the opposite Extremes.</Q></P>
<PB N="186" REF="101"/>
<P>Now for Brevities sake it is common to use these Characters, for this Character + signifieth with Radius or more, or one Side or Angle with an another, for equal =, for less −; so that the general Rule or fundamental Observation which we purpose to use, may be expressed thus:</P>
<P>The Sine of the middle part + Radius is = to the Tangents of the Extremes adjacent, or to the Sine complement of the op∣posite Extremes.</P>
<P>This Rule being rightly understood gives such full directi∣ons, that a man may resolve any Question in the Sphere by it, which makes me judge those culpable of a fault, that accuse him of Prolixity, that made it in so brief a manner. I will define a spherical right angled Triangle, and so come to the use of this Axiom.</P>
<P>In the spherical right angled Tri∣angle A B C, right angled at B, there are 5 things considerable, beside the right Angle, namely, the three Sides and the two Angles; the two Sides next to the right Angle are not no∣ted to be Complements, but the Side A C, the Angle A, and the Angle C, is noted by their Complements to a Quadrant (which are the three things farthest from the right An∣gle B.)
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>If you have two things given beside the right Angle, to find a third (as you always have) the first thing that you are to consider, is, whether it be an adjacent or an opposite Ex∣treme.</P>
<P>That is an adjacent Extreme, when the given parts and the required part joyn.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P><HI>For Example in Adjacent Extremes.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose the given things were A C and A C B, and the re∣quired thing were C B: Here you see that A C is joyning to C,
<PB N="187" REF="101"/> and so is C B, therefore they all joyn, and C is the middle part, for it is between B C and C A the Extremes.</P>
<P>That is an opposite Extreme that hath two things lying to∣gether, and the third thing lieth alone, and that part which lieth alone is the middle part.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose the three things (namely the two given things, and the required thing) were B C, the Angle at A, and C A; then I conclude that C B is the middle part, and that it is an oppo∣site Extreme, because it is alone, and the other thing, namely, C A and A are together: If you ask how this can be, thus:</P>
<P>A C B is between C B and C A, and A B is between C B and the Angle at A, which proves that B C is alone, and A C and the Angle at A joyns: Then is A C and the Angle at A also the two Extremes.</P>
<P>Pray observe this for a Rule, that the right Angle never parts any thing, for if C B, the Side B A, and the Angle at A be the three things, it is nevertheless an adjacent Extreme; for though the right Angle be between the Sides B A, and B C, yet do not count that it parts them, (as another Angle would) so as to make it an opposite Extreme.</P>
<P>Or if the given and required things were the three Sides, you might judge B A the middle part, because it is alone, for the Angle at A parts it from A C, and the right Angle at B is be∣tween B C and it: Now never count that the right Angle at B parts B C from B A, but that they lie together, and A C lies alone, being parted by the Angle C from C B, and by the Angle A from A B, and so is the middle part: These be the first conside∣rations (after you have a Question set you) that you ought to mind, without regarding which of the three things is given or required.</P>
<P>We now come to apply this general Axiom. Suppose I have the Side B C given, the Angle at C, and that the Side C A be required.</P>
<P>From what hath been said I know C to be the middle part and that it is an adjacent Extreme; I will apply the Rule thus, it saith
<PB N="188" REF="102"/> the Sine of the middle part, which intimates that the middle part must be always so called, as you may take the Sine of it; now because its noted to be a Complement, you must call it Sine Complement, to find the Sine of it. This done, I will go to one of the Extremes, and consider what the Axiom saith for that, (admit it be the Extreme C B) It saith the Sine of the middle part with Radius, is equal to the Tangents of the Ex∣tremes adjacent; from whence I conclude, that I must call C B so, as that I may have the Tangent of it; Now C B is not noted to be a Complement, and therefore I call it Tangent C B. Lastly, for the other Extreme C A, for the same reason I must call it so, as that I may take the Tangent of it: and because it is noted to be a Complement, therefore I call it Tangent Com∣plement, to have the Tangent of it: Now as I go along thus in my thoughts, I will set it down as I consider it, and it frames this Rule:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Sine com.</HI> C + <HI>Radius is = to Tang.</HI> C B + <HI>Tang. comp.</HI> C A.</Q></P>
<P>My Question being brought into this order, I will consider which is given and which is required: those which are given, I will set down first, the thing required undermost, and look for them in the Tables by the directions which I have framed from the Axiom.</P>
<P><TABLE>

<CELL> </CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>And thus this Axiom sets your business in order; but now that you may know when to take a Complement arithmetical, or let it a lone; and also, that you may know which thing it is that you must take the Complement arithmetical of, observe this Rule, either in adjacent or opposite Extremes.</P>
<P>That if the middle part and an extreme be given, take the Complement arithmetical of the given Extreme; but if the two Extremes be given, to find the middle part, take no Complement arithmetical at all: This may be sufficient for all Questions in
<PB N="189" REF="102"/> right angled Triangles, will fall out one of these two ways; this Complement arithmetical is what every figure in the Tables wants of 9: it was first invented by my Father, it saves a labour of Subtracting, and so abbreviates the work much.</P>
<P>To many which I have taught, it hath seemed strange that a thing is called Sine comp. or Tan. comp. (when one is to find the Sine or Tangent of it) but the reason of it is this; if a thing be a Complement already (as three things in every right angled spherical Triangle is noted to be) the comp. of that Comple∣ment must be the Sine or Tangent of that Complement.</P>
<P>But pray mind me; I have noted that there are five things in every right angled Triangle considerable, besides the right Angle.</P>
<P>Now observe this for a Rule, (when you are framing your Rule from the general Axiom to work by) that if you call any of these five things by their names, you shall not have the Com∣plements of them, but call any of them out of their names, and you shall; I mean thus. Suppose you have a mind to take the Sine of A B, it is noted not to be a Complement, therefore call it Sine A B, to have the Sine of it, or Tangent A B to have the Tangent of it, the like for C B.</P>
<P>Again, if you have a mind to take the Sine of C A, I consider that C A is noted by the name of a Complement, call it Sine comp. so shall you have the Sine of it, or Tangent Complement, and you shall have the Tangent of it; the like for the two Angles contrariwise: If you have occasion to take the Complements of them, call them out of their names.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P><HI>Example in opposite Extremes.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose A B be given, and B C, and the Side A C be required.</P>
<P>From what hath be said, I consider this is an opposite Ex∣treme, and that A C is the middle part; (for that is alone) call A C Sine Complement to find the Sine of it: and because the Axiom saith, that the Sine of the middle part with Radius, is = to the Sines Complement of the opposite Extremes (for the former Reasons) call A B Sine comp. and B C Sine comp. which is out of their names, and you have this Rule:</P>
<P><HI>Sine com.</HI> A C + <HI>Radius is = to Sine com.</HI> A B + <HI>Sine com.</HI> B C.</P>

<P>Take the figures answering the number of degrees and minutes, which the given things may contain, (out of the Tables) add them together, casting away Radius, (if it comes to be above it) and look for the Remainder amongst the Sines, and take the Complement of that Sine that answers it, to answer your demand.</P>
<P>Suppose it were A B and A C that were given, to find the Angle at C; this is opposite Extreme, and A B is the middle part, call A B (the middle part) Sine, (which is by its name) to find the Sine of it, and A C, and the Angle at A out of their names (which is Sine A C, and Sine A) to find the Sine Com∣plement of them, and thus for any else.</P>
<P>Be sure to remember the Rule that I propounded about the Complement arithmetical, that so you may know when to take it, and when to let it alone. This is in brief.</P>
<P>My Father hath shewed the proportions that holds, and the reasons of them, which I purposely omit, knowing that this Rule works those Proportions: We will now come to the work it self; and I shall do only those Questions which I wrought by the Plain Scale, as being most necessary for our use that go to Sea.</P>

<HEAD>The same things given, to find the time of Sun Rising.</HEAD>
<P>FOr the doing of this, first find the Difference of Ascension (as hath been shewed in the last Question) and convert it into time; which done, subtract it from 6 hours, and you have your desire (in this case where the Declination and Latitude is both one way) but in any case take this in general, that if the Difference of Ascension be before 6 of the Clock, subtract it; if after 6, add it to 6 hours, and you have the time of Sun Rising.</P>
<P>This stands to good reason, forasmuch as the Difference of Ascension is the portion of time that the Sun riseth before or after 6 of the Clock.</P>
<P>In this Example you see the Difference of Ascension is before 6 of the Clock 1 hour 5′ 3/15 (we will omit the part of a part of a minute) I would know the time of the Suns Rising.</P>

</FIGURE> Triangle C B r, you have given B C the Suns Declination, C r B the Angle of the Latitude 50 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>m.</HI> to find B r, which is as many degrees and minutes in a great Circle, as C 6 is in a lesser; find it and convert it into time, and in this case add it to 6 hours, and it gives the hour of the Suns being due East.</P>
<P>And for the time of the Suns being due West, you are to sub∣tract it from 6 hours, (in this case) and the remainder is your desire: The reason is, because as many hours as the Sun is due East after 6 of the Clock in the morning, so long time is he due West before 6 of the Clock in the Afternoon. I have left the working of this to your own practice, only I have set down the Resolution of it:</P>
<P>The Sun is due East 45 <HI>min.</HI> 9/15 past 6 of the Clock.</P>
<P>The Sun is due West 45 <HI>min.</HI> 9/15 before 6 of the Clock.</P>
<P>Which is at 5 of the Clock 14 <HI>min.</HI> 6/15.</P>
<P><HI>Note, That if the Suns Declination be Southerly, then will he be East before</HI> 6; <HI>so that whereas here you add, there you subtract from</HI> 6 <HI>hours, to find the hour of the Suns being due East, or add to</HI> 6 <HI>hours for the time of its being due West; but your own Reason (if you look well on the Scheme) will guide you to know this; and also to know that, it is useless in such cases, for then he is not above the Horizon.</HI></P>

<P>AS I have noted before, the Sun is accounted 17 <HI>deg.</HI> under the Horizon when the day breaks; therefore in the fol∣lowing Scheme let 17 I, be an Arch parallel to the Horizon, 17 <HI>deg.</HI> under it: Let D B C A be an Azimuth cutting the Aequi∣noctial, and the line of 17 <HI>deg.</HI> in the place of their intersection, which is at C: then in the Triangle r B C (right angled at B) you have given B C 17 <HI>deg.</HI> the Angle B r C the Complement of the Poles Elevation 40 <HI>deg.</HI> to find C r the continuance of Twilight (for C r and B u are equal.) I leave it to your own Pra∣ctice: I find the continuance of Twilight to be 27 <HI>deg.</HI> 4 <HI>min.</HI> which converted into time is 1 <HI>h.</HI> 48 <HI>min.</HI> 4/13 nearest.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>So I conclude that between the Day breaking and Sun rising, it is 1 <HI>h.</HI> 48 <HI>min.</HI> 4/15, which is u B: Now if you add this to the Difference of Ascension (before found) B 6, which was 1 <HI>h.</HI> 5 <HI>min.</HI> 3/15 of a minute (I omit the smaller Fraction) you have the time between break of day, and 6 of the Clock, which may be termed u B 6 2 <HI>h.</HI> 53 <HI>min.</HI> 7/15.</P>
<PB N="202" REF="109"/>
<P>And because the day breaks so much before 6 of the Clock, if you subtract it from 6 hours, you have the hour and minute of day breaking, which is at 3 of the Clock 6 <HI>min.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8/15.</P>
<P>Add it to 6 of the Clock, and you have the time of Twilight ending, which is at 8 <HI>h.</HI> 53 <HI>min.</HI> 7/15.</P>

<HEAD>To find the Suns Place and Right Ascension, provided, the Latitude and Declination be given.</HEAD>
<Q>Latitude <HI>50 deg. 0 min.</HI> Declination <HI>13 deg. 15 min,</HI> I demand the Suns Place in the Ecliptick and right Ascension.</Q>
<P>RIght Ascension is an Arch of the Aequinoctial between a Meridian, cutting the Aequinoctial and the point of <HI>Aries</HI> or <HI>Libra;</HI> the Meridian must also cut the Sun or Star in the Ecliptick as here in this Scheme: A B C is an Arch of the Meridi∣an, cutting the Sun at B in the Ecliptick, and the Aequinoctial in C; then C ♈ is the Suns right Ascension.</P>
<P>The Suns Place (as I shewed formerly) is the Suns distance in the Ecliptick, from the nearest Aequinoctial point here B Y.</P>
<P>To find the Suns place ♈ B, you have given the Angle B ♈ C 23 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> and C B the Suns Declination 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 15 <HI>min.</HI> in the right angled Triangle B C ♈; it is an opposite Extreme, and C B is the middle part, I find it to be 35 <HI>deg.</HI> 5 <HI>min.</HI> if you propose the month and the day of the month that the Sun hath this Declination, you may tell what Sign the Sun is in, and what degree of that Sign.</P>

<P>As suppose the Sun hath this Declination here given upon the 14th. of <HI>April,</HI> I consider what Sign belongeth to that Month, and I conclude it is ♉, then say I, as much as the Sun is distant from the next Aequinoctial point above 30 <HI>deg.</HI> (which is the Sine of ♈) so much he is entered into ♉, which is 5 <HI>deg.</HI> 5 <HI>min.</HI> I omit the Fraction.</P>

<P>These be things necessary and very useful in Navigation for several occasions, and that hath made me insist upon them: If you are unacquainted with this way of working, my Father hath insisted upon it largely, and in his works, commonly called <HI>The Doctrine of Triangles;</HI> you may be satisfied both in the Doctrine of right lined Triangles, and Spherical. This I judge sufficient for the two kinds of Sailing.</P>
<P>I would have handled something in oblique Spherical Trian∣gles, and so have proceeded to that incomparable way of Sailing by the Arch of a Great Circle; but the goodness of it is not known because it is not practised: If you love that way of Sailing, (Reader) I commend thee to my Fathers <HI>Doctrine of Triangles</HI> in large, where it is largely treated of.</P>
