<PB N="2" REF="3"/>Arrests, and Molests which have been lately attempted and used for the find∣ing out or seizing of the said Plate and Bullion, which hath been a great hinderance to the Petitioners, and a generall damage to this Kingdom. For by the Importation thereof, many Shippes were imployed, the Navi∣gation increased, the Owners encou∣raged to build and maintaine good Shippes, great profit by the Coin∣age, and by the low Exchange, Mer∣chants had plenty of Money to im∣ploy in the Manifactures of this Kingdome; and generally the whole Kingdome hath been, and is, inrich∣ed by the said Treasure that comes in and remaines in the Kingdome. And the Petitioners are very confi∣dent, That if they could give their
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>Correspondents assurance by an Or∣dinance of both Houses of Parlia∣ment, That their Plate and Bulli∣on may for the future be imported in English Shippes without any mo∣lest or interruption, with Decla∣ration that they should also have and enjoy the full benefit of the Arti∣cles of Peace made with <HI>Spaine,</HI> that then they would imploy Eng∣lish Shippes againe, and remit their Plate and Bullion, and other Goods to <HI>Dover,</HI> as formerly they have done: And for the reall effecting hereof, and better encouragement of the Parties concerned, and for the remo∣ving of all Doubts and Iealousies for the future:</P>
<P><HI>The Petitioners humbly pray this most Ho∣nourable Assembly, to make an Ordinance
