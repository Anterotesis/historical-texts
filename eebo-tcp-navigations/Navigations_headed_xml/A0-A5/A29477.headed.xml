<HEAD>A Brief Relation of the Present State of <HI>Tangier,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HIS <HI>Excellence,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Tiveot</HI> Arrived here safe upon <HI>Jun.</HI> the <HI>14th.</HI> (being <HI>eight</HI> dayes before the expiration of the <HI>Truce</HI> with <HI>Gayland</HI>) where he found that the <HI>Deputy Governour</HI> had obtained a continuance of the <HI>Truce</HI> for <HI>Two Moneths</HI> longer, according to the <HI>Te∣nour</HI> of the former <HI>Articles;</HI> which <HI>Gayland</HI> assured him was done in Civility and Respect to his <HI>Excel∣lence:</HI> for which his <HI>Excellence</HI> sent <HI>Gayland</HI> Thanks, Notifying withall, that it was not in his Power to continue the <HI>Truce,</HI> unlesse permitted to Fortifie the Town: having expressed Orders from the King his <HI>Master</HI> for so doing: But however, that in Honour to Colonel <HI>Fitz Gerrards Treatie,</HI> and to shew his Thankfulnesse to <HI>Gayland,</HI> he was Con∣tent to stick to every point of the <HI>Truce</HI> which was for <HI>Gaylands</HI> Advantage; And yet upon the mayn he was enforced to break immediately. Whereupon <HI>Gayland</HI> asked Fifteen Dayes to Consult with his <HI>Grandees,</HI> allowing that in the mean time his <HI>Excel∣lence</HI> might <HI>Fortifie</HI> the Places <HI>next the Town,</HI> which was done accordingly. The prefixed time being Expired, <HI>Gayland</HI> sent the <HI>Sheck</HI> of <HI>Anger as</HI> Son, to have a Conference with his <HI>Excellence,</HI> wherein he made appear that the <HI>Mahometan Law,</HI> prohibited them to suffer the <HI>Christians</HI> to build any <HI>Fortifica∣tions</HI> in <HI>Affrica:</HI> But that they were contented to
<PB REF="3"/>make a <HI>War,</HI> and to give good <HI>Quarter;</HI> whereupon his <HI>Excellence</HI> Replyed, that <HI>The Sword should decyde, whether the</HI> Mahometan Law, <HI>or his</HI> Masters Orders <HI>were of Greater Force.</HI> That he would neither take, <HI>nor</HI> give Quarter; withall, that <HI>he was</HI> Gaylands <HI>Humble Servant,</HI> desiring them to send immediately, for the <HI>Powder</HI> that was Stipulated for by the <HI>Deputy Governour.</HI></P>
<P>Next day, was the Foundation laid of a <HI>Horn-work Strong</HI> in the <HI>Walls;</HI> being <HI>Canon-proof;</HI> strong in the <HI>Situation,</HI> being on the <HI>Castle-Hill,</HI> every way Advantageous, and Important, because it covereth the <HI>Castle,</HI> Fenceth above 600. <HI>Akers</HI> of Ground; discovereth the Enemie at a great distance; and maketh the place Comfortable: Securing the whole Hill for our <HI>Walke,</HI> and <HI>Ʋse.</HI> (being, 600. yards from the <HI>Castle</HI>) Our other <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Trenches</HI> were in a few dayes brought to that Perfection, that the Ene∣mie durst not Attaque us. The great Advantage hereof we have Experienced in severall Disputes with the <HI>Moores,</HI> who on the last of <HI>Feb.</HI> betwixt 11. and 12. appeared with their whole <HI>Army,</HI> and took up their <HI>Posts;</HI> The greatest Forces coming up∣on the <HI>West part,</HI> towards the <HI>Sea;</HI> where they con∣tinued Pelting for some hours till they were forced off, with considerable losse, and not one of our Men <HI>Killed,</HI> or <HI>Wounded.</HI></P>
<P>The very next day following, and about the same hour, they came on again, but with greater Num∣ber, and Courage; and took up their <HI>Posts</HI> as be∣fore; pressing towards the <HI>New Fort,</HI> which was then a <HI>Half-Bastion:</HI> (built while <HI>Gayland</HI> and his Armie,
<PB REF="3"/>Consisting of about, 8000. Men, look't on) and for a long time continued Shooting, yet killed us but <HI>One</HI> Man. Their <HI>Maine Body</HI> stood upon a Hill, hard by us; whence they continually sent <HI>Reliefe:</HI> But at last, His <HI>Excellence,</HI> taking a fitt opportunity, Or∣dred a Party of Horse, (Commanded by Captain <HI>Witham,</HI>) to Sally out, and bring in their <HI>Red Stan∣dard,</HI> which was Pitched neer our Works: This succeeded according to Wish, for the <HI>Horse</HI> brought off the <HI>Standard, Killed</HI> the <HI>Bearer,</HI> with many more, and put the Rest to <HI>Flight,</HI> without Suffering any Damage at all. Instantly, His <HI>Excellence</HI> Comman∣ded the <HI>Standard</HI> to be <HI>Displayed,</HI> upon that part of the <HI>Fort</HI> that was <HI>Built:</HI> which being seen by the E∣nemie, they drew off in trouble, concluding the losse of their <HI>Standard</HI> to be <HI>Ominous,</HI> the like not having been done before. Since this happened, they have not appeared in such great Bodyes as formerly, coming now only in Loose Parties, and Working by <HI>Ambuscades;</HI> wherof the most considrable, were those of the 13th. and 17th. of <HI>March,</HI> the former was ve∣ry strong, consisting of choyce Men, and the <HI>Chief Leaders;</HI> which on the suddain Encountered our Hourse, and great Courage was Expressed on both sides. We lost <HI>One</HI> man, and <HI>Two</HI> wounded; but very many of the <HI>Moores</HI> were Killed and Wounded, and the rest compelled to Retreat. The <HI>Second,</HI> (<HI>March,</HI> 27th.) (being <HI>Sunday morning</HI>) was a strong <HI>Ambush,</HI> both of <HI>Horse and Foot,</HI> Planted near Us; But after a Short, and Hott Dispute, the <HI>Moores</HI> ran; <HI>Our Horse</HI> fell in among Them, and Slew several, and had done a farr greater Execution, but for the
<PB REF="4"/>Rocks and disadvantages of the Ground. Here we had onely <HI>One</HI> Man shot through the Hand, while many of the Enemie were <HI>Killed: Two</HI> of their dead, His <HI>Excellence</HI> Commanded to be brought off by our men, whereof one by several things found about him, appeared to be a Person of Quality. That which makes this Action more Remarkable, was the Signal <HI>Humanity</HI> which his <HI>Excellence</HI> exprest towards the <HI>Dead Bodies;</HI> for after <HI>Divine Service</HI> Celebrated, (it being <HI>Sunday</HI>) and <HI>Sermon</HI> ended in the <HI>Camp;</HI> His <HI>Excellence</HI> Commanded them to be washed, while himself stood by; and <HI>Two Bieres</HI> to be made, and the Dead to be Shrowded in white Linnen, and laid there∣on, and strewed with Flowers with all prudentiall decency: appointing afterward a <HI>White Flagg</HI> to be carried before the Bodies, after which, Marcht his <HI>Excellence</HI> on <HI>Horse-back,</HI> all the Troops attending in <HI>Squadrons,</HI> with Excellent Order and Modesty; and thus they passed to the utmost of the Bounds assigned us in time of Peace; where the <HI>Moores</HI> met the <HI>Bodies</HI> with a <HI>White Flagg,</HI> and received them with great Expressions of Satisfaction; taking off their <HI>Caps</HI> and <HI>Shashes</HI> from their Heads, (a Cere∣mony not used in their Adorations,) in token of their Respect and Gratitude to his <HI>Excellence;</HI> much amazed at this unexpected Civility; (which up∣braided their former Barbarous behaviour towards those of ours, which have at any time fallen into their hands.) This was done with satisfaction to both sides, and without the least appearance of En∣mity, or ill will: and further to confirm their opini∣on
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>of his <HI>Excellencies Honour</HI> and <HI>Goodnesse.</HI> This <HI>Truce</HI> was continued till they sought and carried off their Dead Men.</P>
<P>Frequent Alarmes we have had; notwithstanding which, his <HI>Excellence</HI> has not at all omitted to pro∣secute the Fortifications; and it is a great Comfort to see how Chearfully, from the Highest to the Low∣est, every man here puts his hands to the Work, in gathering, and bearing Stones, and assisting in all sorts of Labour, and Hazzard, toward the perfecting thereof; out of a Generous and Loyal Emulation, to Imitate his <HI>Excellence;</HI> who <HI>Works, Eates,</HI> and <HI>Lodges</HI> in the <HI>Field,</HI> and has scarce been in Bed since the Expiration of the <HI>Truce.</HI> It is not to be Ex∣pressed with what Zeal, and Alacrity every man here does his Duty, under so Exemplary a Gover∣nour.</P>
<P>Neither are the <HI>Moores</HI> themselves lesse Moved, with the Frank and open Candour of his Behaviour, then they are Amazed at the Irresistible Course of his Successe: To see him carry on his <HI>Fortifications</HI> and beat them too, at the same time; making it, but the one half of his Businesse to over-throw them; Even when <HI>Gayland</HI> was with his whole Army in the Field, to take away their <HI>Standard</HI> from before their Eyes! To Kill many of their Valiantest Lea∣ders, and Rout them upon all Encounters; and last of all, to Conquer them by <HI>Humanity,</HI> as well as by <HI>Force.</HI> Briefly, the Miracles, which his Lordship has done, have given these <HI>Barbarians</HI> a strange Su∣perstition concerning him; Some supposing him to Act by the <HI>Devil;</HI> or however perswading them∣selves,
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>that assuredly he is more then <HI>Man:</HI> Others have taken up a report, that he has made <HI>Flying Ships,</HI> and Great Guns to <HI>run alone,</HI> that he never sleeps but leaning against some part of the Works; and that having scaped so many Dangers, and for his whole Life been so Fortunate in Armes, it is in vaine to Resist, and Impossible to Worst him: And one thing more there is, that keeps them at a Distance, which is, their opinion, that the <HI>Approaches</HI> to this Place are all <HI>Mined,</HI> and that they cannot any where make an <HI>Attaque,</HI> without danger of being <HI>Blown up.</HI></P>

<P>I have just now Received News of a Piece of <HI>Moorish</HI> Valour, which sayes, that an Am∣buscade of some Hundreds of brave Horse, be∣ing Lodged to watch for some of our Scouts; missing of their Ayme, fell upon a Couple of our Dogs, as they were ranging their wonted Rounds, cut them off, and so Retreated to their Body.</P>
