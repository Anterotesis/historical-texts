<HEAD>The Epistle TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing (most Ingenious Reader) that Histories of this Nature have not only been approved as pleasant, but profitable, in stirring up the Minds of <HI>Men</HI> (especially of the younger sort) to the Study of Ingenuity, and a Desire of performing, and being capable of un∣dertaking such Enterprizes as upon sundry Emergencies may re∣dound to their Advantage; I could think of no better way or method, than to mingle <HI>Seriousness</HI> and <HI>Mirth, Ingenious Stratagems</HI> and <HI>Policy,</HI> with <HI>War-like Exploits,</HI> and <HI>successful Undertakings,</HI> in <HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Business;</HI> or what can be reasonably imagined, that may the better suit with every Capacity. And of this kind, what can better employ them, than a H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>story of the Worthy Enterprizes of the <HI>Merchant-Taylors,</HI> who for their Ingenuity and Courage, have been no small Honour to the Kingdom? But to expect I should come to give a particular Account of the Bravery of each Individual, which Time h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Registred in the golden Book of Fame, would be a Task too tedious (if not impossible) to be compiled in the Circle of an Age of Years. But since in what I have layd down, Much may be comprehended in a Little, and vie with, or out-do what has floridly been put (or imposed, as we may say) upon other Trades, beyond their Ʋnderta∣kings, I shall in brief conclude in the <HI>Commendation</HI> of this Worthy Society, Corporation, or Trade, that for Loyalty, Ingenuity, Heroick Atchievements Charity, and many other matters, none have exceeded it, if (at least) we should submit to an Equality. And so referring the Rest to the Judgment of unbyassed Persons, I remain an Honourer of the Members of this First of Trades.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Introduction; together with the Beginning of Renowned <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s Love to fair <HI>Dorinda;</HI> And the Resolution he took thereon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen as <HI>England</HI> (after the Conquest) began to flourish in Trade and Manufacture, (enriched by the Industry of its Inhabitants, by traffiquing, as well abroad as at home, amongst those that contributed to its Promotion of this kind) the <HI>Merchant-Tay∣lors,</HI> then called <HI>Linnen-Armourers,</HI> were <HI>Eminent</HI> not only in Peace, but War; as amply appears by their <HI>many Noble Exploits,</HI> in Honour and Defence of their Coun∣try. And since they have been memorable on sundry occasions, I shall, to obliterate that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch is objected against them, touching their Manhood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> deliver (as I find them in their particulars and generals) a candid Relation as to matters of Love, Business, Witty Intreagues, and War-like Exploits, performed by sundry Wor∣thies of this Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession, which have raised them a Lasting Memory. And since <HI>Love</HI> is one principal Thread, whereby Histories of this kind are fastened to the affe∣ctions and good liking of the Reader, I think it altogether convenient to proceed regularly, and in order, that nothing may be omitted which is capable of adding a due Lustre, or rendering the Vndertaking pleasant and delightful; the Proof of which take as followeth:</P>
<P>Amongst other Youths whose discretions prompted them to undertake this Pro∣fession, was one <HI>John Hawkwood,</HI> of Parentage but mean, yet of a goodly Perso∣nage, a quick App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehension, and sound Iudgment, which afterward raised him to a considerable Degree and Advancement in the Record of never-dying Fame.</P>
<P>This Youth having undertaken the Profession of a <HI>Taylor,</HI> and by his neatness, activity, and dextetious performance, soon gained the Love and Applause of his Master, and his Customers, with many others, continuing to be respectful and obli∣ging to all manner of People: so that as he grew in Years, his Credit encreased, and with it his Ingenuity. But now (as it often happens to Young Men in the bloom of their days) he casting his eyes upon <HI>Dorinda</HI> his Master's fair Daughter, a Virgin compleat in Beauty, and worthy to be beloved; it so happened, that by often feeding his fancy with the Fair Object, he became intangled in the snar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Love, which for a while he struggled with, or rather seemed to slight, as being altogether ignorant of its Power and Force; not considering, that like Lightning, the more it is opposed, the more Force it gathers, till breaking through the Cloudy Resistance,
<PB N="2" REF="5"/> it makes the greatest noise; that is, The more a Lover strives to stifle his Flame, the hotter it burns, and torments him more than if he gave it vent. And this our Youth found in the end to be his case, and therefore began thus to debate with him∣self: <HI>Well,</HI> said he, <HI>and Must I give Love way? Must I yield to the Flames that he has kindled, or rather kindled by the Eyes of my Beloved Mistris, who knows not (perhaps) what pain she puts me to? or if she did, the disproportion being great, How can I with Reason expect a Cure? Tush, tush,</HI> continued the amorous Youth, <HI>Love is that which baffles Reason, and puts serious Considerations to flight: A thing that takes the Diadem from Queens, and makes a Conquest over Prince and Peasant: Why then shou'd I dispair? Although indeed I have but little ground to Hope, yet a tryal will be easie; and it is far better to run a hazard, than to live in pain: Fortune may so bring it about, that although the Fair One I admire be cour∣ted by many, she may (notwithstanding the seeming difficulty) be mine. <HI>Hellen</HI> at first was coy, yet <HI>Theseus</HI> gained her love: And <HI>Paris,</HI> though a Shepherd, won her from a King. And why in this case may not the Lot be mine, amongst so many Blanks, as if the chance seemed easier? It is but venturing; and come the worst, I can but lose what otherwise I never must expect.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Then casting fear aside, I will be bold,</L>
<L>And either fix more firm, or loose my hold.</L></Q>
<P>Having said thus much, he resolved to watch his opportunity, so that he might find a convenient time to tell his fair Mistris how dear and tenderly he loved her, and how (without a suitable Return) he must remain unhappy. Nor was it long before he was possessed of so convenient a time; For looking out of his Chamber win∣dow in the Evening, he espyed the Ioy of his Heart going abroad by her self; where∣upon, unknown to any of the Servants, or indeed to any of the Family, he followed her in the best Equipage the shortness of the time would permit him to furnish him∣self withall; and although he was assured he had many Competitors, or Rivals, he re∣solved to know his Doom,
<Q><L>And to submit to Fortune's s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Will,</L>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OVr Youth resolving upon what he had determined, and observing which way the fair <HI>Dorinda</HI> went, out-stripped her by a nearer path; and so opportunely meet∣ing, he made his low, but amorous submission, paying his respects as on that occasion was suitable; when as she not suspecting wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was intended, but thinking he had met her by chance, began to question him where he had been, as also of his business; to which he replyed, that <HI>His only business was to wait upon her, and to tender his Ser∣vice with all the humble and endearing Respect imaginable; and that only in her Smiles he could be happy.</HI></P>
<P>This mysterious Discourse (notwithstanding she knew not well as yet to what it tended) raised blushes in her fair Cheeks; and as he walked with her, made an En∣quiry into its meaning; whereupon he plainly told her, that <HI>The Langu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of his Eyes had a long time spoken his desires, and seeing neither wishful looks nor sighs had made her sensible of his Passion, he was resolved to let her know it in a Dialect that might better inform her:</HI> And thereupon proceeded in a passionate manner, to

<P>Vpon this, the Beauteous <HI>Dori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>da</HI> having paused a while, as one surprized at such an unexpected Discourse, or rather Demand of her Love, (which she had not as yet fully determin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to bestow upon any) she told him, <HI>That she little expected to hear him speak in such a way, hoping (according to the most favourable construction she could make of it) that he was but in Jest: For if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e presumed to insist upon what he had mentioned, he might indeed despair of obtaining his Wish; and not only so, but incurr, in an high degree, both Hers and her Father's Displeasure: But if he would be so prudent, as to speak to her of Love no more, he might not only have a pardon for what was past, but expect to have it buried in Oblivion.</HI></P>
<P>This Answer, returned with sharpness and a contracted Brow, struck our Lover with trembling and amazement, insomuch, that for a time he knew not what to say: But after a while recollecting himself, he fell on his Knees before her, and intreated her, <HI>If he had offended, not to impute it to him, but to Love, whose irres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stable Power, he hoped, would prove a sufficient Plea to excuse him; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if Destiny had so ordered it, that he must struggle with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lame that in spight of res stance over-power'd him, he must submit to his Fate.</HI> More he had said, but whi st this Discourse lasted, the fair <HI>Dorinda</HI> arrived at the house of a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sin of hers, to which and, it seems, she went abroad that Evening; and upon her having admittance, our Lover (pensive and melancholly) made his Retreat, blaming himself now for what

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OVr Youthful Lover having undertaken a Task of much difficulty, that is, bound himself from speaking in the Dialect of Love, for fear of displeasing his fair Mistris, (for so she had commanded) his Countenance, by the ardency of his Affections, was much altered, and he became lean and pining away, insomuch, that it was taken notice of by most of the House, and many asked and enquired into the Reason, yet could not get the Secret from him, but falsly conjecturing by his sighing and hanging down his Head, that his Body was afflicted with some Distemper, when indeed the Disease was in his mind; and although she, in whose power it was to cure it, neglected, and refused to apply the Balm of Condescending Kindness to the wound her fair Eyes had made, yet no Care was wanting in others to give him Ease: But alas! neither Druggs nor Potions can ease the Mind that labours under Love: Nor cou'd the Physician find the cause of his Distemper, but attributed it to the Effects of a Feaver; as indeed it was; but such a one,
<Q><L>As neither Skill, nor powerful Cordials fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce,</L>
<L>Can from the Center of the Soul divorce:</L>

<L>And Tyrant-like does triumph o're the Heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>Our Lover, I say, being entangled in a snare, out of which (at that time) no means presented a way for his Deliverance, but the yielding of his Dear <HI>Dorinda,</HI> or his pining into the Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, he tormented himself long between Hope and Fear, as wretched Lovers do, who feed upon Camelion's Food, feed upon Imaginations, as thin as Air, and not so much available. Sometimes he repined at the Meanness of his Birth and Fortune; at other times he conceited a Secret Rival possessed that Heart which he so much desired, and took up all the Room in fair <HI>Dorinda</HI>'s Breast: Oft he pressed himself to enquire about it, but as oft was dashed with the Fear of offending, since Silence was injoyned him. And so (tossed like a restless Ship upon a stormy Sea) he continued many days, till at last, notwithstanding all the seeming Coldness of his Mistris, he discovered something that gave him a light into the Cause of her refusing him; for so it happened, That going abroad, as usually she did, under pretence of paying a Visit to a Cousin of hers, she forgot the Keys of her Cabinet, which our young Lover (whose Eyes were alwaies vigilant) perceiving, &amp; it coming into his Head, that by reason of her conference with an old Woman, who frequently came to enquire for her, that some Letters might happily be there, that might one way or other let him understand her Affairs, for he verily believed that Female Emissary might have more than Common Business with the fair <HI>Dorinda:</HI> This Curiosity prompted him to a search, and there he found amongst others these follow∣ing Letters.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Hawkwood</HI> finds out his Rival, and decoys him by means of a Letter, counterfeited in the name of <HI>Dorinda,</HI> to a Mad-house, and under pretence of his being distracted for Love, leaves him there.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MVch grieved was our youthful Lover, to think his Mistris should so slightly give away her Heart, if those may be said so to do, who rather consent to marry the Wealth than the Person, and are lured by Golden Promises into insensi∣ble Danger. And now he made it his business not only to have an Eye upon her, that he might the better understand whether she persisted in her Resolves, but also used such Industry, that he found out his Rival, being (it seems) one whom Fortune, by the Industry of his Parents, had furnished with a plentiful Estate, but on the contrary, Nature had been unkind, in rumpling and distorting his Body in a diso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derly form; and Wisdom had been as backward in furnishing him with Vnderstanding; yet (as the Old Proverb has it, considering <HI>Fools have Fortune</HI>) to this Medly of Creation, this Hotch-potch of a Man, the beautiful <HI>Dorinda</HI> gave the pledg &amp; plight of her Faith; so that nothing but the Nuptial Ceremony was wanting, and that, as you have heard, was fairly on the way: So that what to do in this case the Generous <HI>Hawkwood</HI> was at a loss; Delay he knew would breed Danger and Discovery of the business to her Parents, who, for ought he knew, might allow her Choice was too Poor and Mean a Revenge, and might justly incurr her everlasting Hatred: So that being in a manner distracted in his opinions, he sometimes began to think of Revenge and a Resolution to lose his Life or sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s Blood; but that again was dashed and checked by other Resolutions; so that in the end he came to a Point, and con∣cluded on a notable Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tagem, which he put in execution after this manner:</P>
<P>Vnderstanding fair <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> had sent the Letter, wherein she promised to appoint <HI>Impolito</HI> a private Meeti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Novice was not a little over-joyed, largel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> provid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst the happy expected day.

<PB N="7" REF="7"/> some hopes of gaining her favour) had been slighted and rejected, the which, together with other Disorders and Infirmities of Mind, upon the sudden news of her Mar∣riage, had wonderfully discomposed and crazed his Wits, insomuch, that daily grow∣ing worse and worse, he feared in the end it might turn to an incurable Phrenzy, if not timely redressed, and the thoughts of his past-misfortune put out of his mind; for that in his Ravings he talked of nothing but Women, Assignations, Appointments, and Love-Intreagues, frequently enquiring for, and calling upon one <HI>Dorinda,</HI> who indeed was the Chief cause of his disorder.</P>
<P>The Doctor having heard this plausible Story, began to pitty the Youth, commi∣serate his misfortune, and exclaim against her that had occasioned it; withal, promi∣sing to do his utmost, in order to the Restoring of him to his Right Senses, bidding him neither despair of, nor fear his Recovery: Nor would he use him roughly, but as tenderly as the thing required. This discourse of the Doctor's tickled the Fancy of Young <HI>Hawkwo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> who had in his Imagination already accomplished his design; so that appointing to bring him within three days with the Overture of a Good Reward, he took his leave: So that now he had no more to do, than to frame a Letter in the Name of <HI>Dorinda,</HI> to bring the Woodcock into the snare.</P>
<P>Being come home, and finding some Papers that <HI>Dorinda</HI> had written on sundry trivial occasions, to slip no time, lest he should be anticeeded, he sits him down, and so exactly counterfeited, in her Hand, the following Letter, that without great diffi∣culty it could not be distinguished even by her self: For in this Craft great was his Ingenuity, as well as in many others, that gained him Applause and Admiration a∣mongst the Youths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Contents of the Letter were these:
<LETTER LANG="eng">

</LETTER></P>
<P>The Letter being thus aptly framed to the purpose, lest delays might prevent the Design, he posts away early the next morning, and as Luck would have it, meets <HI>Impolito</HI> just coming out of his Vncles Gate; him he salutes, and with many Crin∣ges delivers him the Letter, telling him withal from whom he brought it; which in∣deed he might have spared; for he verily concluded upon the first sight of the Super∣scription, that it could be no other than <HI>Dorinda</HI>'s Hand, and thence guessing at the
<PB N="8" REF="8"/> Contents, had scarce (for the Transport of Ioy he seem d to be in) Patience to open it, asking in the mean time Twenty Questions, one upon the neck of another; to which, as far as convenient, the witty <HI>Hawkwood</HI> returned suitable Answers: But when he had opened it, and perceived by Part what the Whole meant, impatient of delay or loss of time, he embraced the Messenger as in a passionate manner, and cryed out, as in an Extasie, <HI>O dear friend! how much am I beholden to thee, for bring∣ing me this Happy News! and how much may you hereafter expect of me for your Labour!</HI> And thereupon catching him by the hand, without any Enquiry who he was, or where he lived, he pulled him on, saying, <HI>Come my lucky Pilot, shew me the way, without longer tarrying, to my Haven of Happiness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hawkwood</HI> perceiving Fortune favour him in this Enterprize, lead him (the less to be observed) all the by-ways imaginable, and held him in pleasant Discourse, till they came within sight of the Doctor's House, at which time having heard the Imper∣tinent Discourse of his Rival, he began to have some relenting in his mind, and to pitty his Imbecility; but the Hard-heartedness of the fair <HI>Dorinda</HI> towards him, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opes he had by that Artifice to break off the Match, (after some Reluctancy con∣quer'd all Compassion, and) put him upon a tryal of the credulous Youngster's Pati∣ence: So that making up to the House, he boldly knocked at the door, and soon found admittance, by the means of him that waited; when whispering him in the Ear after he understood the Doctor was within, he bid him tell him, that he had brought his Cousin, and was desirous to attend him in his retirement. With this request the Servant readily acquaints his Master, who gave order, That <HI>Hawkwood</HI> (to whom he gave the stile of <HI>Gentleman</HI>) should be admitted, commanding him that waited; to entertain the Young-man the mean while with some Pleasant Stories of Love, the better to keep him in Countenance, whilst matters might be ordered to dispose of him. All this being exactly observed, our Witty Youth being arrived at the Study of this grave Professor, after having made his Complement, began to make a Repetition of what he had told him before: and withal, that no Cost should be spared, if, by his In∣dustry, he restored his Kinsman to his Vnderstanding and dispossessed him of the disor∣der of his Mind, which he that Pretended to all things made no Bones to Promise; and thereupon he gratified him with a Sum that proved (at present) satisfactory, de∣siring to be let out a back-way, lest otherwise the parting might be tedious and trou∣blesome wonderfully suggesting the affections of <HI>Impolito</HI> towards him, or rather that upon his leaving him, he might fall into a raving Fit, to his further prejudice. This, upon the proposal of a Day of Return, was granted; and so the witty <HI>Hawkwood</HI> is dismissed, leaving the unthinking Cully in the Trap, though at present overwhel∣med with Ioys, in expectation of finding his <HI>Dorinda</HI> there.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NO sooner had our Ingenious Youth performed what he intended, and made his escape, but down came the Man in the Whiskers to poor <HI>Impolito,</HI> who, till he was deceived, imagined at the sound of every step it was his Mistris the fair <HI>Dorinda,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/> which had caused him to draw nearer and nearer the Foot of the Stairs, thinking no less than that <HI>Hawkwood</HI> went up to inform her of his arrival; but upon the ap∣proach of him I have mentioned, he imagined it might be her Father, whom he indeed had heard of, but never seen, and so (not altogether forgetting his Duty) he fell on his Knees, and anticipated what he was about to say to him, by asking him Blessing. This posture so unexpectedly, and out of season, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ether with the mention of <HI>Dorinda</HI> to marry, (of whom, it seems, he asked Consent, with many protestations of his Love and Sincerity) confirmed the old Gentleman in all that <HI>Hawkwood</HI> had told him; and thereupon taking him from the ground, he began to fumble his Pulses, and consider the working of his Temple-Veins, which through the vehement agitation of his passionate expressions, were not in a little disorder: The Youngster the mean while wondering what was meant by this unusual handling; yet continuing his discourse of Love, with many Cringes, he began at last to enquire for his Mistris, declaring how he was sent for, and to what intent he came. <HI>Well, well,</HI> said the old Gentle∣man, <HI>be not too hasty Swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art, and I will go up and send her down to you.</HI> But no sooner had he left him in expectation of such an Happiness, but at the ringing of a Bell, two or three lusty fellows entred at another door, and catching poor <HI>Impolito,</HI> carried him forcibly up Stairs, where clapping him into a warm Bed, provided for the purpose, they bound him down with Cords, and so (whilst he remained in much Consternation and Confusion, wondring what was intended) they posed him as bare as a Coot, by shaving off his Hair; after which, the old Gentleman accosted him with his Instrument, and other Furniture, useful on that occasion, bleeding him on both Arms till such time as he became exceeding faint, and seconded that with sundry Applications and Medicaments; no Intreaty of his, nor Relation of what he was, or to whom he appertained, was any ways availing to prevent it; for the more he told the story of his Love, and the End of his coming thither, the more he increased (in the opinion of those that had to do with him) the Conception of his Distemper; all his serious Protestations, and earnest Asseverations of what he was, and to whom he was allyed, being only taken for Ravings, and the Defects of a disorderly mind; so that in the end, through Physick, unusual Dyet, and Impatiency, he was in a manner what (by mistake) they had taken him for.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Impolito</HI> remaining in this plight, great was the Enquiry after him, and the rather, because <HI>Dorinda</HI> had some hours after his departure sent a Letter, much to the same effect as the former; so that after three days absence, and no intelligence of him, they began to imagine strange things: The Vncle, that he was Spirited away; and <HI>Dorinda,</HI> that he slighted her, either absconding or denying himself; and others had their peculiar and different Conceptions of the matter. But so it hap∣pened, That after a tedious search, and the exact Description of him to divers per∣sons in those Parts, with promises of Rewards and Gratuities, Information was brought to <HI>Gaspero</HI> in whose hands he was, who coming thither, found him in a strange condition, brought, by his Vsage and Dyet, so low, and so much altered, that it was difficult to know him. <HI>Impolito,</HI> upon the sight of his Vncle, cryed out, and made a grievous Complaint, declaring how he was trappan'd, and what miseries he had undergone, withal, producing the Letter he had received, which being compared with what <HI>Dorinda</HI> had afterward sent, agreeing much in the Substance, and more in the Hand, it was concluded to be an Artifice of hers; for that the Intreague of their loves being all along kept secret, it could not be thought that such a business could be contrived without her knowledge; and that on which this suspicion was the rather grounded, was her sudden condescension. And with this, and what else had
<PB N="10" REF="9"/> happened, the old Woman who was House-keeper to <HI>Gaspero,</HI> was sent to acquaint her, who was indeed as yet ignorant of the particulars of what had happened; nor was she a little amazed when she heard them, protesting her ignorance and innocency. As for the Doctor, he begged Pardon for what he had done, pretending and alledging it was done through mistake, though by him designed to a good intent; that he had been imposed upon, and was sorry and ashamed he had been so deceived and abused: But so lively described the Party that committed <HI>Impolito</HI> to his custody, that he was (not long after) discovered: As will appear in the following Chapter.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Plot succeeding to <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s wish, the Match is broken off: <HI>Impolito</HI> is sent into the Country; And <HI>Gaspero</HI> his Uncle seeks and concludes to revenge the Affront: With the manner of his Resolution.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Lovers thus crossed in their expectation, the cross accident (through many thwartings that arise) created so great a misunderstanding between them, that by degrees they became cold to what before they so hotly were intent upon; &amp; the rather, for that <HI>Impolito</HI> being much weakened, and out of order, was sent into the Country to recover his Health, and soon after, for the bettering his Vnderstanding, into For∣reign Parts, under the Protection of a Tutor: Where, for a while, we will leave him.</P>
<Q><L>Thus <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s Plot succeeds in the first part:</L>
<L>But yet he gains not fair <HI>Dorinda</HI>'s Heart.</L>
<L>Though somewhat pleas'd that he succeeds so well,</L>
<L>That yet some Hopes within his Breast may dwell.</L>
<L>Hope, that doth feed the labo'ring Thought of Man,</L>
<L>And is a <HI>Medium</HI> 'twixt their Joy and Pain,</L>
<L>Carrying some Pleasure where Men hope in vain.</L></Q>
<P>By this means, I say, <HI>Hawkwood</HI> being freed from what he before apprehended would suddenly leave him no place for Hope, rejoyces like a reprieved Malefactor, that (at least) he has gained Time, though not the utmost of his Wish, and by new Ser∣vices strives what he can to appear something in the Eyes of fair <HI>Dorinda,</HI> who had by this time cast off the disturbance she was in, and concern for what had so lately happened, which required not much difficulty, seeing in that Match she rather strove to gratifie her Ambition than Love; but still he found her the same towards him: Sometimes indeed she would seem to give him a Smile, but then again would destroy that favour with a Frown; during which time, the restless <HI>Gaspero</HI> had used his utmost diligence to find out the Author of the Intreague before mentioned, breathing nothing but Threats of Revenge; and was so successful, by the Description, and other Circumstances, that he pitched upon <HI>Hawkwood</HI> to be the man; and the rather, for that (at that very time) he was not only absent from his Master's House, but was seen returning from that of the Doctor's: and therefore verily concluding, that it had been contrived by him and <HI>Dorinda,</HI> not so much for his Nephew's disgrace, as his own, who had so earnestly laboured in the business: He concluded sometimes on one thing, and sometimes on another, to revenge the Affront: Sometimes he thought to make known what had happened to <HI>Dorinda's</HI> Father, and to demand a publick acknowledgment and satisfaction: At other times he thought this low, and vow'd
<PB N="11" REF="9"/> to Right the Injury by Law; but these were dashed, upon the consideration of the Proposals he had made to <HI>Dorinda, viz.</HI> That in case the Marriage succeeded, all the Rents and Profits he had already received of his Nephew's Estate, should re∣dound to himself: and this covetous Reason was the only one, for which he was so earnest, in contriving and clapping up a private Match. So that waving these, he resolves on a private Revenge, whereby (as he supposed) the Suffering of the one might redound either to the Grief or Shame of the other; for he verily believed, that upon <HI>Dorinda's</HI> little Concern for the breaking off the Match, that another had gain∣ed her Heart; and so proceeded to conjecture this might be him: Whereupon, blin∣ded by Passion and Mistake, he at first resolved upon a fatal way to make a Separation, which was by procuring him privately to be murthered: But again, upon second thought, weighing the dangerous consequences, if it should be discover'd, he conten∣ted himself to change it into an extraordinary Beating or Cutting, which might prove more lasting and painful than the former: and this was his absolute determination.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Gaspero</HI> being still resolved upon Revenge, accidently happens on <HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iel</HI> and <HI>Bragwell,</HI> two Ruffians, to whom he commits the Punishment of <HI>Hawkwood;</HI> and by what means it is to be brought about.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>GAspero</HI> having decreed as aforesaid, yet not daring to attempt it himself, it so hapned: As he was looking out of his Window one Evening, he espyed two Ruffian-like fellows walking carelesly in the street, appearing by their Garb and Motion to be destitute both of Money and Imployment; insomuch, that at that time it came into his Head, that these were wonderful sitting to execute his Revenge: Wherefore, when he had a little narrowlier observed them, he sent a little Youth he kepe to run on Errands after them, with order to invite them to his House. These Fellows, who would have run a Mile to a Three-penny Ordinary, upon this Invita∣tion, began to wonder what it should mean, yet stood not to dispute the matter, but followed the Youth, as supposing to what end soever it was, it could not be to their prejudice: And so being brought into the Hall, the Boy went up to his Master, and informed him, that the Men he had sent for were below, and waited his good plea∣sure; whereupon he ordered him to carry them into his Parlour, and set before them such Meat and Drink as the House at that time afforded; which was done with all convenient speed. This unexpected Entertainment did not a little surprize them, for Now or Never they thought they had met with their good Angel, which made them smile upon each other, and ask the Boy the cause, who told them, he knew no other than that it was his Master's good pleasure. Then began they to conclude, that this was some Gentleman, of an Ancient Family, who generously (though contrary to the fashion) kept up the Hospitality of his Ancestors; and so, without any further scruple, fell on feeding and carrousing, not only for present satisfaction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut to pay their hungry Bellies the Arrears of divers days before, wherein they had Dined at Duke <HI>Humphry</HI>'s.</P>
<P>When <HI>Gaspero</HI> supposed his new-come Guest had well refreshed themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he came into the Room, and whilst they stood cringing and complementing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id them heartily welcome; and so commanding the Boy away, after a Glass or two had gone round, he said, <HI>Gentlemen, you may well wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der that (you being Strangers to me) I have taken upon me to invite you into my house; for indeed (as I rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber) I have n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
<PB N="12" REF="10"/> seen either of you before I saw you passing by: But</HI> (continued he) <HI>Gentlemen, there is more in it (perhaps) than you can guess at, or I am willing, without a so∣lemn Promise of Secresie, to divulge unto you: Promise me, I say, to keep Secret what I shall propose to you, and if when it is proposed, you will undertake it, you shall be bountifully rewarded: Or if you refuse it, in consideration that it may spread no further, and that thereon you will plight and engage your faiths and troths, you shall not go altogether empty-handed from my House.</HI></P>
<P>This kind of Discourse made the two Ruffians stare upon each other, as not know∣ing for some time what to reply; but being men of a desperate Fortune, at length waxing bold one of them brake the silence, and said, <HI>Sir, your Bounty towards us has already ingag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d us to oblige you in any thing that is within our power; there∣fore for my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt, I shall be willing to be directed by you in any thing that may stand with your conveniency or good-liking; and as for your mistrusting our fidelity, let that be far from you.</HI> Thus said the one, and the other confirmed it as the Senti∣ments of his Mind; and in brief, both of them made such Protestations, that <HI>Gas∣pero</HI> stood no longer doubtful, but opened all the business to them, from the beginning to the ending, aggravating the Affront, and requiring them to revenge it, in execu∣ting what he had determined on <HI>Hawkwood.</HI> This without further delay they promised to undertake, and seemed to rejoyce, that an opportunity of that kind was put into their hands to serve him; and then murmured, that him they were to under∣take was not some Gyant, or Monster of a Man, that in exerting their Valour, their Zeal to serve him might more eminently appear; or that it was not their happiness to engage with odds of number; boasting at a large rate their wonderful Exploits and valiant Atchievements; adding, that in this case the Affront being so great, in their opinions, Murther was too small a Revenge, if it was possible it could be car∣ried further.</P>
<P>These Expressions delivered with so much Bravado, made <HI>Gaspero</HI> conceive he had happened on the most worthy Champions of the World, and began to compute <HI>Guy, Bevis,</HI> and the Ancients, but Child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en to these; and thereupon perceiving they wan∣ted convenient Weapons to mawl the Youngster, who all this while was ignorant of what was intended against him, impatient of delay, he runs to his Armoury, and fetches a couple of rusty Back-swords, made in the days of his great Grandfather, and these he recommends as fit Instruments of his Indignation; but withal, com∣mands them they should proceed no further than to cutting and slashing, or make him compound for his Life with the loss of a Limb, or the like. But now a greater diffi∣culty was started, <HI>viz.</HI> how they should conveniently light on young <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> so that when they had accomplished their business, they might escape undiscovered: one while they were for watching his going abroad; at another, to find some quaint De∣vice to get him abroad by a wile, as he had done <HI>Impolito,</HI> or to send for him in a feigned Name: Many things they suggested of this kind, and often randyed about the matter; when in the end, the old blade bethought himself that <HI>Green-Goose Fair,</HI> annually kept at <HI>Bow</HI> by <HI>Stratford,</HI> was on the following <HI>Monday,</HI> which lucki∣ly happened to be St. <HI>Willielmus</HI> day, who is much honoured by the Taylors, as their Patron, and in honour of whom, they for the most part keep every <HI>Monday</HI> Holy-day, as those of the Gentle-Craft do for St. <HI>Crispin.</HI> To this place he doub∣ted not but young <HI>Hawkwood</HI> (who was ever frolick and gay) would resort; and that upon his return singling him from his Company, they might (under some pretence of scraping acquaintance) use him at their pleasure: and the better to know him, that they might not be mistaken in the man, one of them was to go to his Master's House
<PB N="13" REF="10"/> in the habit of a Porter, to deliver a Letter, as brought up by the Carrier, from a Friend of his in the Country: All which succeeded so to their wish, that having a good Stipend in hand, and larger promises when the business was effected, they laid their Ambush, though to their small advantage; as in the following Chapter will appear.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Hawkwood</HI> (coming from <HI>Green-goose Fair</HI>) was set upon by Two Ruffians, hired by <HI>Gaspero;</HI> and how he left them for dead: The consternation he was in, and the debate with himself about his departure: The Lines he left for <HI>Dorinda:</HI> His setting forward unknown to the Family; and the consternation it occasion'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>AS Fortune or Fate would have it, young <HI>Hawkwood</HI> answered their expectation so pat, in making it his Recreation to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lk to the Fair, that they could not wish (as they thought) any thing to fall out better: When having dogged him a great part of the day, when the evening approached, they perceived by his taking leave of his Company, who were revelling with their Lasses, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was about to return home; and so it happened to further what they possibly could expect: That notwith∣standing the Iollities of the day, he being somewhat melancholly for the scorn where∣with <HI>Dorinda</HI> seemed to treat him; and for that, since the departure of <HI>Impolito,</HI> she seemed to cast her favours on another such-like of a Medly of Creation, of whom I shall say something hereafter; he, to avoid the concourse on the main Road, and shun the company of those of his Profession, who (in the height of their merriment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he well knew, would entice him to stay abroad late, which was not his custom; he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I say, to do this, took his way the farthest about, through the lonely fields, very few Buildings being (in those days) between that and <HI>London:</HI> And now <HI>Dareill</HI> and <HI>Bragwell</HI> (for so they were called) thinking themselves cock-sure of doing what they had undertaken, passed him, who in his pensive mood took little notice of them, as being ignorant of their purpose: But coming to a convenient place; (it being now dusk
<PB N="14" REF="11"/> in the Evening) they loytered for him, suffering him to overtake them, and then, af∣ter giving him some opprobrious words, from which he gathered what they intended, and shrewdly guessed at the cause, and would have made some Reply, but they so furi∣ously fell upon him, who had no weapon to defend himself, that they prevented it; for now he that in One Man had never met with his equal in strength thought that Now or Never was the time of trying his utmost force; and therefore, without any words, having received several severe Cuts, he grapled with <HI>Dareill,</HI> and violently wresting his Sword out of his hand, flung him from him again with such force, as mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his bones shake within him; and so furiously charged upon <HI>Bragwell</HI> before the other could recover, that he not only obliged him to give back, but made the Blood run fearfully about his Ears. <HI>Dareill</HI> seeing his Companion in this plight, and himself without any weapon, runs to the Stile, and pulls from thence a Bar, with which he came behind <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> and gave him such a blow e're he could turn about to receive him, as made him bend with one knee to the ground; but suddenly recovering him∣self, he was not long unrevenged; for being by this more and more in raged, he laid so hard upon <HI>Dareill,</HI> (the other be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng already faint for loss of blood) that he made him fall as dead at his feet; and then charging upon the other, who was staggering to the relief of his Companion, inflicted on him so many fresh wounds, that he likewise dropped, and with a faint voice cryed out for Mercy: So that <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> by the fearful wounds he had given them, supposing they were no longer men of this World, and finding himself hurt, threw down the bloody Sword, least by bearing it away, the matter might be discovered; and bidding them beware how they basely and ingloriously attempted to turn <HI>Assassins</HI> for the future, (tho' at the same time he verily believed they were never more capable of it) he pursued his way, pensive and thought∣ful of many things, but especially of what had befell him; and soon concluded by what he had gathered (as I said) from some words they had let fall, that it hapned through <HI>Gaspero</HI>'s procurement; but thinking himself sufficiently revenged, he resolved to conceal the matter; and so coming home, and pretending weariness and indisposition, he got him to Bed, having first provided materials to dress the hurts he had received.</P>
<P>Long had not <HI>Hawkwood</HI> been in Bed, but the Servant-Maid (who came to bring him a Cawdle, and to enquire how he did) told him, That a Neighbours Boy, who had been at the Fair, had brought the sad News of two mens being murthered in the Fields; and <HI>I'le warrant you,</HI> said she, <HI>it has been done by some damn'd Rogues or other, for their money; and it was well</HI> Iohn, (said she, looking earnestly upon our Youngster, for whom she had no small affection) <HI>that you escaped their hands, see∣ing you came home so late. It was so,</HI> replyed he; and thereupon shewing much dis∣position to sleep, (though indeed he had other matters to think on) she left him. And now being alone, he began to think of what he had done, as also what would become of him, if it was known; <HI>Although</HI> (thought he) <HI>Heaven knows I fought in my own defence, to save my life; yet having no w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tness on Earth to prove it, (should revenge∣ful</HI> Gaspero, <HI>who will undoubtedly hear of what had hapned, bring the matter to a Tryal) it will assuredly go hard with me. But how</HI> (then replyed he again to himself) <HI>can he prove it? Yes, surely my being abroad late, by the self-same way I took, which many th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t knew me we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l noted; and above all, if I am searched, by the wounds I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e received, which will answer the weapons found by the dead Bodies. But then again, may I not plead my in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocence and justifie the Fact? Alas! alas! trust not, fond man, too much to that; Might and Clamour in so doubtful a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may overbear even Innocence it self. Well, what then is to be done? Why, only to avoid the Danger by slight. Ah! but then</HI> Dorinda <HI>must be left. Why, what
<PB N="15" REF="11"/> of her? She scorns thy service, rejects thy Love; yet in the beholding of her lovely Eyes there is some pleasure, and in Hope there is a glimmering of Joy. VVell, but consider again, that to come to a disgraceful end, though undeserved end, will not only divorce me from</HI> Dorinda, <HI>but bring a reproach upon my Relations. Fly th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, fly, I say, and reserve your self for a better Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the pensive <HI>Hawkwood</HI> having debated with himself, passed over the restless night till the morning dawned, when getting up, he packed up such Necessaries as he thought convenient; together with the money he had got by his obliging behavi∣our, during his Service, that he might be gone with the first opportunity; the which whilst he was doing, he heard the People tune their discourse to the bloody Dialect of Murther, and horridly exclaim against the Murtherers, desiring nothing more, than that they might be taken, protesting Hanging was too good for them, and devised a∣mongst themselves a Thousand ways to dispatch them, when found: <HI>Ah!</HI> says one, <HI>they were bloody-minded Villains I'le warrant ye. Ay,</HI> says another, <HI>or else they would have been contented with the poor Mens money, and not have robbed them of Life and Money too. Alas!</HI> continued a third, <HI>and perhaps of something else that was more precious; for I'le warrant ye, these poor men were in drink, (God bless us) and men in drink, ye know Neighbours, are not in a sit condition to dye.</HI> Then by a cross Wind comes in another, and with a shrill tone cries, <HI>Ay, but Neighbours, consider, consider, I say, their poor Wives and Children, what a Taking they will be in when they hear of this sad misfortune; alas! my Heart e'en bleeds to think on't.</HI></P>
<P>Our Youngster hearing these and the like discourses, although he was before but wavering about his departure, (so much did <HI>Dorinda's</HI> love constrain him) is now re∣solved upon it; and thereupon, that the consternation of the Family may be lessen'd about his departure, (for he intends to acquaint no body with it by word of mouth) he wrote the following Lines, and put them through the Key-hole of <HI>Dorinda</HI>'s Cham∣ber, not doubting but they by that means wou'd come to her fair hands; and to her discretion he left it, whether she would communicate them to any other, for so much he signified as a Superscription: The Lines, I say, were these:
<Q><L>NEeds must the man be gone that cannot stay,</L>
<L>The man whom Fate and Fortune drives away.</L>
<L>Ask not the cause, fair Maid, you know in part,</L>
<L>'Tis you have caus'd the Wounds that makes me smart:</L>
<L>Your Cruelty, your being too unkind,</L>

<L>Yet scarcely can you guess for what I go,</L>
<L>Though Time in Bloody Lines the Cause may show;</L>
<L>And whilst I range the World, the news may fly</L>
<L>Into your Ears with an unwelcome Cry:</L>
<L>That I in my defence that blood have spilt,</L>
<L>That wou'd with me more cruelly have dealt,</L>
<L>And leave you Judge whose was the greater Guilt.</L>
<L>Your Cause it was in the Original,</L>
<L>That did create the bold <HI>Assassins</HI> fall.</L>

<P>He needed not subscribe it, for she very well knew his hand: Nor did his wish in part fail him; for when she came to unlock her Chamber-door, espying the Paper, she took it up, and read it, wondering what it should mean. But whilst she was pausing, news was brought her, that <HI>Hawkwood</HI> was missing, and that he had been met some Miles out of Town, with a Bundle under his Arm; which had bred no small wonder in the Family, in consideration, that upon the searching of his Trunks, they found he had taken with him many things, the which, if he intended to return in any convenient time, (at least) he would not have done: Nor could the Maid, who brought this word, and entirely loved him, though her modesty had all along concealed it, refrain from Tears in the Relation. And now the fair <HI>Dorinda</HI> too plainly guessed at the mean∣ing of his Lines, though she knew nothing particularly of what had lately befallen him.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How upon the Bruit of a Murther divers persons hasted to the Field, tho' before they came, the two Ruffians recovering, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re got from thence; when killing by the way a Sheep, and taking out his Heart, they made <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spero</HI> believe it was <HI>Hawk∣wood</HI>'s, whom they said they had murthered: With other things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT seems, a little after <HI>Hawkwood</HI> had left <HI>Dareill</HI> and <HI>Bragwell</HI> destitute (as he thought) of recovery, (for the one he imagined already dead, and the other expiring) a Youth came by, and seeing them in that condition, together with the blood that co∣loured the ground, affrighted at so ghastly a sight, he fled to the Town, and reported what he had seen, but for some time could not gain belief, the Peo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le telling him they might be some drunken men, who came from the Fair, fallen asleep, and that having disgorged their stomachs, he by the imperfect light, took it for Blood; but he constant∣ly affirming the contrary, and repeating their words and groans, at last so far pre∣vailed, that divers undertook to go with him to the place: And upon this Youth's report it was, that those that I have mentioned grounded their discourse.</P>
<P>Divers (as I said before) undertaking to go with the Youth, it so happened, that when they came there, they found not the men he spoke of, but there was the Bar of the Stile besmeared with Blood, and much Blood lying on the ground; so that by plain symptomes the signs of Murther appearing, they concluded, that there had been some persons murther'd, and upon second thoughts, imagined they might be Thieves, and their Companions for fear of discovery (after the departure of those that killed them) had carried off the dead Bodies, and either buried them in the Fields, or hid them in some Ditch or Hedge; whereupon they made a long and fruitless search, till late in the morning: So that not returning home so soon as was expected, the old Women concluded upon the truth of the matter, which occasion'd the discourse under <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s W ndow, which much contributed to his departure; though in the end his Name was thereby raised high as a Piramide; which in the sequel of the History will appear.</P>
<P>Now some may demand what beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the wounded men, and what News <HI>Gas∣pero</HI> received of this Adventure? To which I answer, That being come to them∣selves, and fearing not only a discovery of the business, but being in equal fear for <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather more (by being on the unjuster side) than he for them, they made as good a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hift as they could to get away, were gone so far before they were enquired for, that those who came in search of them cou d not find them, and in the deplorable
<PB N="17" REF="12"/> condition they were in, fell to consulting with each other, how they should shew their Faces to <HI>Gaspero,</HI> seeing they had promised so much and performed so little; and espe∣cially, if he come to know of their Treatment, how they should come by their further Reward: Many ways they proposed; but at length espying Sheep grazing by the light of the Moon, in the next Field, they resolved to kill one of them, and take out his Heart, which they would make <HI>Gaspero</HI> believe was that of <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> whom they had killed and privately buried. But then another question arose, how they should come off about their wounds, seeing if they had been really so valiant as they proposed, it could not be reasonably expected, that one man could have used them at that rate: But to salve this, they likewise concluded to inform him, That having done the Ex∣ploit, and coming late through many by-ways, to prevent pursuit or discovery, they were set upon by Nine or Ten Robbers, who (from behind a Hedge) fell upon them be∣fore they were aware; but as soon as they faced about and charged them, they fled, some with the loss of an Arm, others miserably hacked and wounded.</P>
<P>Thus having contrived to delude the Old Man, these pretended Heroes turned their valour to the destruction of a harmless Sheep, and taking out of his Body what they wanted, they hasted to <HI>Gaspero</HI>'s House, the which (having well washed their wounds, and put themselves in the best order they could) they reached by that it was day-light; when upon their knocking at the Gate, the Boy peeping through the Wicket, and perceiving their Hair starch'd together, as it were, with blood, their Visages pale and wan, with some Scars and Cuts upon them, their Garments rent, and many other signs of disorder, he ran up to his Master, and (being an awkward Country Youth) told him, That the <HI>Redshanks</HI> and <HI>Wild-Irish</HI> were at the Gate, and had brought <HI>Raw-head</HI> and <HI>Bloody-bones</HI> along with them: Such foolish Fables (by way of description) it seems his Mother had put into his Head, to bugbear him in his Infancy; and so much he fancied these men to be like what he had heard, that he could not be induced to go down again to enquire their business, tho' they still stood knock∣ing with much earnestness, as ashamed to be discovered by any in the posture they were in: Nor did <HI>Gaspero</HI>'s fears possess him (upon the relation the Boy had made) with any thing else, but that they had brought <HI>Hawkwood</HI> dead, or sorely wounded, along with them, to bury, or otherwise dispose of him in his House; whereupon he conclu∣ded, if it was so, he would neither admit them, or own that he knew them, or had set them on work, for fear himself should be charged with the Murther; but going up, peeping out of the window of the Lodge, &amp; perceiving the contrary, he descended again, and opened the Gate; yet at the sight of his <HI>Janizaries</HI> he was not a little amazed, and they on the other hand complained of their standing there too long, which (they said) had they been pursued, might have been a means to have discovered the whole In∣treague: But waving further discourse, he carried them into a private Room, and fetched divers Cordials, and other refreshments, to revive them, whom he found, by the faultering of their speech, faint, and almost spent; and after they had taken seve∣ral lusty swigs, so that their spirits came (as it were) again, he began to enquire of the success of the Enterprize: To whom <HI>Dareill</HI> replyed; As for that, or any thing else in that or the like nature, that he or his Companion undertook, he need not fear the success; for they were not wont to make Childrens Shoes of their business, but to perform it through-stitch: <HI>As for him who lately put the Affront upon you, you may</HI> (continued he) <HI>be well assured, he will never do the like again. Nay, if he do,</HI> (says <HI>Bragwell,</HI> pulling the Sheeps Heart out of his Pocket, and holding it up) <HI>then this is none of his. Ay, ay,</HI> says <HI>Dareill, if he do Brother, that is none of his: But as sure as that is an Heart,— Mark ye me Sir— How!</HI> (says <HI>Gaspero,</HI> interrup∣ting
<PB N="18" REF="13"/> him) <HI>and, Have you murther'd him? I wou'd not for any thing have had you done so: How! murther'd him! Is it possible? Possible,</HI> replys <HI>Dareill, alack, alack, very easie with us that are used to it: But this, indeed, (because you injoyned us to the contrary) was not with our Wills. No indeed,</HI> said <HI>Bragwell, it was not with our good-Wills, but by chance; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r thinking to strike him with the flat, to crack his Crown, or so, by an unfortunate slip of my Back-Sword, I whipp'd off his Head before I was aware, and that I would have brought you, were it not too cum∣bersom; but this may satisfie any reasonable man of the Truth of it; for unless he have two hearts and two heads, with a Needle and Thread to sew himself up again, he's no more a man of this World. And what,</HI> said <HI>Gaspero, have you done with him? What if the Body should be found? Fear not that,</HI> said <HI>Dareill, for we have laid him up to the Resurrection, with such an heap of Earth and Stones upon him, that an Earthquake can't remove him. Well,</HI> said <HI>Gaspero, this is more than I bar∣gain'd with you for; though, being done, 'tis past recovery. But how came you</HI> (continued he) <HI>thus hurt Gentlemen?</HI> To which last question they replyed, as they had before determined, <HI>viz.</HI> How nine or ten well-armed Thieves burst out of an Ambush upon them, and had given them those wounds before they could prepare or put themselves in a posture of Defence; but they afterward had not only put them to flight, but pepper'd them off in such a manner, that they doubted not, that although they had so much strength as to fly from the place, yet that some of them were by this time in the condition of <HI>Hawkwood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gaspero</HI> being thus far satisfied, and taking all they said for granted, immediate∣ly fetched them Balms, Salves, and Oyntments, helping them to dress their wounds, and appointed them a private Apartment, with all manner of Necessaries, till they should be recovered, with an intent then to dismiss them with such Rewards as might charm them into silence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Gaspero</HI> packed away the Ruffians beyond the Seas; And how he was terrified with the Comical Adventure of a naked Wench, which he supposed to be <HI>Hawk∣wood</HI>'s Ghost; And many other pleasant matters that befell on this occasion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY this time the two pretended Mirmidons being pretty well recovered, and much recruited with good Dyet, <HI>Gaspero</HI> was desirous to be rid of their company, lest by words they might let fall, the supposed Murther should come to light: But then he considered, if they were abroad, and hankered thereabout, it might be the same thing; and therefore, what to do in this case, he found himself at a loss; but considering something must be done, he at last came to a conclusion: That if they were sent beyond the Seas, his fears would by their absence be removed; and about this he resolved to confer with them, not despairing to have it done with their own liking, for that he found their fortune was as good in one place as another; and to have it better'd by a good Sum of Money, in a distant Country, might be acceptable. Nor (as Luck would have it) did they less jump in quill; for just as he was debating this matter with himself, they came down to him, and besought him that he would dismiss them, for that considering all the circumstances that attended the Intreague, their long tarriance in his House might breed a suspition; and that, although they were very seldome seen, yet one or other of the Servants might scatter words that mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t discover them; and seeing they were men of Fortune, if he could set them
<PB N="19" REF="13"/> over Sea, so that when they came there, they might have something to subsist on, till they had opportunity to recruit, it would do very well. This was on both hands agreed on, without any further controversie; and they making a vow never to return, unless forced to it by some extraordinary accident, he gave them (to be sure that they should go) a Bill to receive Fifty <HI>Spanish</HI> Dollers, at <HI>Bruxelles,</HI> in one of the <HI>Flemish</HI> Provinces, and somewhat to bear their Charges by the way; and so packing them on board an outward-bound Ship, he bid his two Champions farewel.</P>
<P>Thus (as he supposed) being revenged, and freed from all fear of discovery, he began to carress himself in his security; yet sometimes, when he reflected on the imagined Transaction, he found a damp upon his Spirits, but mostly in the night, for through multitude of business in the day he was diverted from it; but in the end a Comical accident fell out, that overwhelmed him with a thousand fears; &amp; was in this manner:</P>
<P>It so happened, that <HI>Gaspero</HI> having a pleasant Orchard, or Garden, belonging to his House, and it being in Autumn when the pregnant Earth produces the effects of her teeming labour in their full perfection; the <HI>Douvigha,</HI> or Governante, (for so I may properly call the old Woman, who was his House-keeper) hearing her Daughter, a plump red-headed wench, was to be married to a jolly blade, a Coachman, her fel∣low-Servant, she sent in the Evening for her, when <HI>Gaspero</HI> was gone abroad; whe∣ther to give her Instructions, or to what other purpose, I leave to the construction of the Reader; but however, that she might be more charming to her Bridegroom, she admonished her to go to the Spring in the Orchard, (or rather, for its pleasantness, might be termed a Fountain) and there to wash her self, directing her to unstrip her self, and leave her Clothes in an Arbor a little beyond it. The Wench took this for a kind of an odd Prank; but her Mother, for many weighty reasons, urging it, and she being favoured by the light of the Moon, no longer disputed her Commands, who promised to watch the mean while, that no body should come in at the Garden-Gate to interrupt her, the Boy being gone out with his Master; and as for any other Invasions, she doubted not, but the walls would secure her against them; and so she proceeded to do what she was commanded.</P>
<P>Now it so unluckily fell out, that a young fellow of the Town, having by the help of a Ladder gotten over the Wall, to possess himself of some of the delicate Fruit that grew in the Orchard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was at that very Iuncture gotten upon a Tree that hung over the Spring, with its spreading branches laden with Fruits, rin'd with Vermi∣lion and Gold; or, as the Poet has it, in Relation to the Garden of the <HI>Hesperides:</HI>
<Q><L>With Golden Fruits the laden Boughs did bend;</L>
<L>On whom a wakeful Dragon did attend. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Now whether the Fellow, who perceived the Lass approaching, had this whim in his Head, to fancy her the Dragon that kept the Orchard, I submit it to the Iudg∣ment of the Reader. But if this story be true, (as I would not have you doubt it, seeing it is in Print) he lay snug upon one of the branches, not only till she unclad her self, but when she entred timerously by degrees, as either by reason of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing a stranger to the place, or fearing the depth, (being no great Artist, I supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, at swimming on her Face) or that she meant thereby not to cool all at once; but in the end growing bolder, she fell (the better to make quick-work on't) to dashing spat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣ing, dabbling, and scrubbing her self at a strange rate: When (O the danger of too much curiosity!) our Youngster in the Clouds reaching his Head too low, (upon what account is doubtful, tho' some may be apt to guess it was out of humility, by this time
<PB N="20" REF="14"/> fancying her to be <HI>Diana</HI>) he lets go his hold, and down he drops, Apples and all; giving a dash as great as <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Logg, whom <HI>Aesop</HI> tells us, was thrown to the Frogs, together with the further account he gives of it in his Fable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This sudden noise not only troubled the Waters, but made the Lass (like a River-Nymph, with dropping Hair, disorderly hanging, some on her Breasts, and some on her Shoulders) haste thence, &amp; unmindful (through sudden fear) of returning for her Clothes, in her native Livery of Nakedness, spring out of the Fountain, and with speed (not inferiour to <HI>Attalanta</HI>) haste to the House for shelter. Now, as if Mis∣chief had this Night set all her Engines on work, the old Woman had just let in <HI>Gaspero,</HI> who (having sent his Foot-Boy about further business) was returned alone; and had scarce entred the Hall-door, and about to shut it, but in burst the Wench upon him, and with the violence overthrew him, where he lay crying out for help; whilst our Governante (to colour the business the better) letting her Candle drop, (as you must suppose, through fear, though indeed to hide her Daughters naked∣ness, till she escaped into some corner of the House, for further relief): Whilst the Governante, I say, having dropped her Candle, came to his relief, and by woful ex∣perience, upon enquiry, found that his Guts (by reason of the fright this Apparition put him into) were fallen very low in his Breeches; and further, that not only a deadly paleness had covered his Face, but he was taken with such a fit of trembling, that his Ioints seemed of no more use to support him, than if they had been made of a Quaking Pudding: Nor could she in a long time (though she strove what in her lay) bring him to his right Wits; and when that Little Sense he had left was returned, he still trembled, and with a gnashing of his Teeth, and a wild kind of a Countenance, desired to be conveyed to a Cousin's House of his, not far distant from his own; charging her withal, upon her Life, not to say any thing of what she had seen.</P>
<P>Glad of this opportunity was our <HI>Douvignia,</HI> that she might in time return to en∣quire into, and calm her Daughters fears, who (poor Wench) stood shivering and shaking on the Stair-head, as not being capable of entering any of the Chambers, by reason of their being locked: Nor stayed she, after <HI>Gaspero</HI> was safely lodged in the hands of his Friends; but leaving him to make his Apology for perfuming the House, she abruptly took her leave; and coming home, struck a Light, where she found the poor Girl, as aforesaid, who revealed to her all that happened, intreating her to fetch her Clothes, and suffer her speedily to depart; which she accordingly did; the Fellow (before her coming) having scrambled out of the Water, and recovered (by the help of his Ladder) the other side of the Wall; but by leaving (for haste) his Bag of Apples behind him, that plainly demonstrated the purpose of his coming. This, upon her Mothers returning with the Clothes, the Daughter was informed, and soon after became satisfied; though at first she imagined it to be no less than the Prince of the Air turned Madg-howlet, who supposing her (at a distance) to be a Sea-pye, or young Duckling, had stooped to make her his Prey. But being again clad, and dismissed, she vowed, if her Husband was not contented with the white∣ness of her skin, he should scrub it himself with his Horse-Cloth; for she'd venture no more by Moon-light on that occasion.</P>
<P>The old Woman having dismissed her Daughter with Motherly Advice, rela∣ting to Marriage-af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>airs, and the Boy being by this time come to keep house, she returned to her former Charge, by the way framing an excuse for her absence; (as who doubts, but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m n have t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em at their fingers ends on all occasions, especially Gover∣nants) As for he that doubts this, let me tell him by the way, it will be hardly worth
<PB N="21" REF="14"/> his while to give himself an experimental satisfaction, the matter being so com∣mon.</P>
<P><HI>Gaspero</HI> by this time being pretty well recovered, and having refreshed himself, was perswaded to go home, but he would by no means hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken to it, fancying (it seems) that this naked Lass was no other than the Ghost of <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> imagining in that consternation, that the red Hair that hung in Rats-tails, by reason of its being wet, to be the bloody Cuts and Slashes that had been given to dispatch him. Such powerful effects have fear to delude the Eyes and Senses; though it might probably happen, that (to heighten the delusion) the Lass might through the same effect of fear, be reduced to a Ghostly paleness: But however, the old Woman being silent, for her Daughters credit, and not attempting to convince him of the mistake, his sickly fancy presented such Ideas for the future, that he soon removed (to the no small wonder of the Inhabitants, who knew not the cause) from that House, though a very pleasant Seat, to another in a distant Village, and there continued for a while in much Antiety; but the Ghost appearing no more, he by degrees was recon∣ciled to himself: Where I shall leave him, and return to young <HI>Hawkwood;</HI> from whom (for the better contexture and pleasantness of History in this kind) I have been too long absent.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Dorinda,</HI> and the whole Family, were much troubled at the sudden departure of <HI>Hawkwood:</HI> And how he coming to an Inn on the Road, hears the Relation and Adventure of a blind Race; undertakes to lye in a haunted Chamber, and takes the supposed Ghost Prisoner, and is well rewarded for his pains.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Master of <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> and the whole Family, (the fair <HI>Dorinda</HI> not excep∣ted) being much troubled at his sudden departure, sent divers Messengers after him, but they either missing the Road he went, or being too slow, returned no wiser than they went; and being unsuccessful in this, they began to guess at the reason of his going away; but though there were many Arguments, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> yet all came short of the true reason; but <HI>Dorinda,</HI> who indeed understood some part of it, tho scarcely the main business, yet w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at she knew, (for fear of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lame in not sooner re∣vealing it) she kept it to her self: But most of all, the Maid (who hoped to gain his Love by her good Services) lamented his absence.</P>
<P>Whilst this concern for <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s absence was at home, he was trudging the Road, or wandring through the unfrequented Woods, the better to avoid pursuit, till at length (weary and faint) he sate him down, and began to lament his misfor∣tune; but most of all, that he must be banished from the sight of fair <HI>Dorinda; O!</HI> (said he) <HI>that this days Sun sees me so unhappy, to forgo all that is dear to me on Earth!</HI> But having vented his sorrow in sighs and such-like expressions, he began to be more moderate, and recollect his manly spirits, to fortifie his Reason, that so, whatever befell him, he might with Fortitude and Patience support himself. But having by this time travelled far, and night coming on, he bethought himself of a place to repose in; and having a pleasant Town in Prospect, he hasted thither, and took up in the chief Inn, which was not large, being only a Country Village; yet not doubting of a Lodging, he sate him down, and called for what the House afforded, and so stayed till much within night before he asked whether he might lye there or no; when calling his Landlady, he put the question to her, who shaking her Head,
<PB N="22" REF="15"/> told him, That indeed they had a spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Room, with a Bed in it, but to deal plainly with him, there had been for some nights past a great disturbance there, by the forci∣bly throwing things up and down, and that she could conclude no other from thence, than that it was haunted with some evil Spirit; and for that reason, she being a Widow-Woman, and many times none but her self and her Maid in the House, was about to leave it.</P>
<P>At the seriousness of this Discourse, delivered withal with such earnestness, <HI>Hawkwood</HI> could not choose but smile; at which the Hostess seemed a little angry, imagining he laughed at her, as if she had told him a Fable; but he bid her be paci∣fied, telling her, that seeing it Rained, (as indeed it did) and was a very stormy night, rather than he would be destitute of a Lodging, he would venture (with her leave) to take up in that Room. <HI>Nay,</HI> (said she, taking him up hastily) <HI>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a care young-man, what you say: for I vow and protest, I would not have any Body come to any harm in my House for all the World; for</HI> (continued she) <HI>the noise is so ter∣rible about Twelve of the Clock, or somewhat after, that the stoutest of our Car∣riers (though you see they are great Lubbarly fellows) dare not venture into the Room; Nay, one of them did but just put his Snout in, and had a stone thrown at him, which beat him down Stairs, and so mawled him, that he lay by it three days.</HI> By this <HI>Hawkwood</HI> (who was of a prompt wit) verily conceited it must be some trick put upon the House; for he considered, that the Devil seldome or never carries stones in his Pocket, by reason he alwaies leaves his Breeches at home (if ever he wears any, as ten to one he does not); and thereupon rested the better satisfied, promising not to refuse that Bed at any rate. But whilst they were thus discoursing, in comes a great Lubbarly fellow, laughing till his sides cracked again; and being de∣manded what was the occasion, could not speak for proceeding in his Laughter; but in the end growing a little calmer, said, That he had been at the running of a blind Race: And when they desired him to expound his Meaning, he said, That blind <HI>Tom,</HI> a fellow well known in the Town, had laid a Wager with another that could see, to run with him a Mile; but with <HI>Proviso,</HI> that himself should name the Time and Place, and the other to be ready at an houres warning, whenever the blind man should require it. <HI>Now,</HI> says he, <HI>you may think this somewhat strange; but you shall hear how it happened. The blind man, you'l say, being as capable of seeing in so dark a Night as this is, as the other, called him out, about an hour and a half since, to run down the</HI> Green-Lane, <HI>where (you must know) there are divers miry Sloughs; some good fellows that sided with blind</HI> Tom, <HI>laying Cart-Ropes from Hedge to Hedge, and holding either end on the inside of the Banks, on the brink of the Sloughs, when he that had Eyes came foremost, they, with a sudden jerk, whipt up his Heels, and tumbled him over Head and Heels in the Mire; yet not well un∣derstanding how the Accident h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppened, the first bout, up he gets, and hastens on to the second Slough, where he was served in the like nature, and then discovered the mischief, by the laughing of those behi d the Hedge; and so (fearful to pro∣ceed any further, for fear of breaking his Neck) all bemired, he scrambled up into the Field, and let the blind man p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss on to win he Wager: And nothing vexes me, but that they were such Blockhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds to laugh; for had they not done it, ten to one, the fellow would have concluded, the Spirit that haun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s your House, had been abroad, and conjured up his Heels.</HI> Vpon this the Bumpkin set up a laughing again, as if he would have burst the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ist-band of his breeches. And although the Hostesses mouth stood almost a quart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of an hour at half-cock, to tell him what <HI>Hawkwood</HI> had proposed, yet could she not be heard till his laughter was ended; but
<PB N="23" REF="15"/> then giving ear to what she said, he greatly disapproved his resolution, laying before him the dangerous consequence, and telling him a world of stories of Spirits, Witches, Fairies, <HI>Robin Good-fellows,</HI> and the like; the which when <HI>Hawkwood</HI> began to doubt, in relation to the Truth, he quoted the Famous History of Dr. <HI>Fau∣stus,</HI> the Play of the <HI>Lancashire</HI> Witches, the penny Book of the <HI>Fairy</HI> Pranks, and the Ballad of <HI>Robin Good-fellow,</HI> vowing he had seen them all in Print, and wondred that any body would question the truth of 'em: <HI>But it may be, friend,</HI> (continued he to <HI>Hawkwood) you are not so deep learned, nor so great a Scholar as I am, and therefore have none of these Books in your Library.</HI> At this <HI>Hawkwood</HI> could not forbear smiling, and with his silence seem to give consent to what he afterward said, for he staid not long, being called away to participate of the Wager. And now bed∣time being come, tho' many perswasions were used by the Hostess, and others, to avert him from lying in that Room, yet he used such Arguments, that he made them rest satisfied, that (if he was not a Conjurer, as some of them vainly conjectured him) he was a man that had been conversant in such matters, and was not afraid of Spirits: And so furnishing himself with a good Battoon, and a dark Lanthorn, with a watch Candle in it, up Stairs he goes, and takes possession of the Chamber, laying him∣self down on the bed in his Clothes, and setting the things I have mentioned by him; whilst the Hostess and the rest were Crossing themselves, and praying for his success, the former protesting upon her honesty, that if he conjured down, or freed her House from the Spirit, she would give him all the money in her Purse.</P>
<P>Now so it happened, that about the usual hour, that is somewhat after Twelve, as he was musing on the matter, he heard something about the Window; for note, it was an upper Room, which had a Glass Casement, which went out into a Gutter, between two ridges of Houses, and so into a Neighbours House at a Window of the like nature. <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> as I said, seeing this, resolved (whatever it was) to let it enter without molestation, and thereupon lay as still as a Mouse in a Cheese; when by and by open flew the Casement, and in with the Heels formost comes some∣thing all in whire, and began to tumble and throw the things about with a terrible noise; whereupon <HI>Hawkwood</HI> softly rearing himself up, goes with his Lanthorn in one hand, and his Cudgel in the other, and coming as near as was convenient, opens his Lanthorn, which shining just in the face of the thing, where the Shroud covered it not, he plainly perceived it to be no other than the laughing Fellow, dressed up in <HI>Pimlico,</HI> as Painters foolishly Picture or fancy the shadow of a Ghost: At the sight of the Light, the Fellow started back; but soon recovering himself, thought to out∣dare <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> whom indeed (as he afterward confessed) he little expected to find there, although he had heard him talk of it, but found himself mistaken; for <HI>John</HI> stepping up to the Beard of him, said, <HI>And have I caught ye?</HI> whereupon recoiling still towards the window, with a feigned, yet lamentable voice, he said, <HI>Mortal, come not near me, whoe'er thou art, lest I destroy thee. Not near thee!</HI> said un∣daunted <HI>Hawkwood, wert thou him that I take thee not to be, I would approa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h thee.</HI> And with that he fell upon him with such fury, that in vain he endeavour'd to retreat; for being a fat and unweildy fellow, in hastily retiring, he stuck fast in the Window, with his Breech innermost, which <HI>Hawkwood</HI> belaboured till he cryed out for Mercy, and then he dragged him in again by the Heels, and pulled the shroud over his Ears; whereupon the fellow looked so simply, that he could not find in his heart to give him any more rough usage; but after passing some Iests upon him, for his simplicity, clap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the Shroud about his Neck, opened the door, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so lead him down stairs, like a Horse in a Collar; which the Servant-Maid (who had listened
<PB N="24" REF="16"/> with much fear during the scuffle) perceiving, runs down one pair of Stairs, and tumbles down another, to tell the people, who were assembled below in expectation of the issue, that the Lodger had taken the Devil Prisoner, with a great Ruff about his neck, &amp; was bringing him down amongst them: Vpon these words of the wench, who delivered them with abrupt stammerings, and a frightful countenance, they were in a Quandary what to do, whether to stay or to flee the House, for now they verily belie∣ved young <HI>Hawkwood</HI> to be a Conjurer; but e're they could determine any thing, he entred the Room, with his Prisoner, whereat fome shuffled one way, and some another; but he calling to them, and bidding them not be afraid, for that no hurt would ensue to any, they recollected their scattering Senses, and at last found him (who had been so long a terror to them) no other than their Neighbour at the next House, so that their fear was turned into loud laughter: And the Man looking all this while like an <HI>Ignoramus,</HI> and enduring their gibes and taunts, ingenuously con∣fessed, What he had done, was to make the Hostess leave her House, that it might fall into his hands; and for the Pranks he had played, he said, he was well bumba∣sted, and heartily sorry, hoping that would make satisfaction; but <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> not content with this, commanded him to ask her forgiveness upon his Knees; which done, in token of reconciliation, he made them shake hands, and kiss each other. And so that night being spent in merriment, the next morning (being highly ap∣plauded for his courage, and well rewarded for the discovery) he took his leave, and left the Hostess in quiet possession for the future.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Hawkwood</HI> having left the Inn, went on Shipboard, where he found one <HI>Lovewell,</HI> of the same Profession, who gives him an account of his Birth; tells him the Tradition of St. <HI>Winifreds</HI> Well; relates his being put to the Gentle-Craft; and the strange Adventure of a dead Man.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAwkwood, <HI>by his last nights Adventure, having encreased his store, and there∣by not only enabled, but encouraged to proceed, seeing in his early underta∣kings Fortune had befriended him, resolves (now he was on his way) to see other Lands, and so makes to the next Sea-Port, where he found a Ship ready to sail, and having agreed with the Master committed himself to the Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>Now it so happened, that making his Profession known, he found a dapper young fellow in the same Vessel of the like Mystery; and finding him expert and ingenious, with him he contracted such familiarity, that afterwards they became almost insepa∣rable Friends, and were successful in many Adventures; as the Sequel will mani∣fest.</P>
<P>Hawkwood, <HI>I say, having met with a Companion of his Travels, who had almost been as strangely crossed by Fortune as himself, especially in the business of Love, which in general he had told him, he imagined his happiness encreased upon him: And now they being long at Sea, he made it his request to him, that to pass away the time till they could land at the first Forreign Port, he would give him a relation of some particulars that had passed, which he promised him,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but to run them over at present as briefly as might be, by reason they might otherways prove too long for the Voyage, and by that he might be obliged to break off abruptly.</HI></P>
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>
<P>I was <HI>(said he)</HI> born in <HI>Flint-shire,</HI> at a place near St. <HI>Winifreds</HI> Well, other∣wise called <HI>Holy-Well,</HI> so famously memorable for its frequent Visitations, and the Cures it performs, and (as Tradition has it) sprung up above a Thousand Years since; where the Head of that Virgin was cut off by a <HI>Pagan</HI> Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, from whom she fled to save her Chastity; and ever since, the Red Stones in the bottom of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are fancyed as a lasting Memory to her Name and Sanctity, to bear the Tincture of her Blood. Here, I say, being born, and christen'd by the Name of <HI>Francis Love∣well,</HI> through the care of a tender Mother, I soon grew up, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d being at convenient years, was sent to an Uncle of mine, who professed the Gentle-Craft in <HI>London;</HI> but although he was Rich, he was so penurious, that I had not been there a week before I began to miss my Mothers Cupboard (my Father being now dead); for being barred of my Belly-Timber, and kept short so soon, I began to think that worse might follow; for our Family consisted of no more than my Uncle, an old Wench, and my self; and working privately, we lived in a dark smoaky Alley, over which a discouraging Cloud of Night hung, even in the midst of Day, so that we seemed to live in mists and shades; yet were up early and late; the Old Man taking especial care, that his Cousin should not be idle; so that in a small time, with making up Wax, and drawing the Ends, I smelt worse than a Tarpawlin: Nor could I have a sweet breath, for Onions and toasted Cheese was the greatest part of our Dyet; which my Uncle extolled above any other Provision; only on <HI>Sundays</HI> we were allowed a Butter'd Pudding; but as if Eggs, Plumbs, and Suet, had been as great Strangers in <HI>London,</HI> as in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> when we sought for any of them, we were forced to return them, like a broken Citizen, <HI>Non est inventus:</HI> And though I had contrived to surprize or storm the Cupboard, I had not mended my Markets; for indeed my Uncle was so kind (however he fared abroad I know not) never to exceed us in our Dyet; and I the rather believe he did it, to encourage us to be valiant against the Tyrant <HI>Famine.</HI> By this means, and often fasting, I be∣came lean, and out of order; I complained indeed, but my complaints were only answered, It was the Fashion of the Town to live sparingly; so that, when at any time I got a Penny for carrying home a pair of Shoes, I fancied my self as rich as <HI>Croesus,</HI> making it serve me for two mornings draughts, at half a pint a time; for our Drink at home was no better than our Victuals, not One in Twenty by the taste being able to distinguish it from Water. Thus, for three Months, I lived a kind of an impatient life, every day expecting my Mothers coming up, that I might have my Dyet mended, or be removed. But whilst I was in this expectation, one Evening being sent to a Customer with a pair of shoes, I met a Coffin, with divers in Mourning following it, and amongst the rest, in a doleful tone, with wringing of hands, and many other expressions of sorrow, I heard a woman cry out, O my dear Husband! how am I separated from thee by cruel Destiny! whom I so much loved, who wert my Joy, my Hope, and all my Comfort in this World: Thou, alas! <HI>(conti∣nued she)</HI> art now going to a dark and gloomy House, where is no joy, no pleasure, no delight; to an House where the sound of Musick is a stranger, and where those dwell, that neither eat nor drink. Now I being but a Novice, and hearing this description of the place, could (at that time) fancy it to be no other than my Uncles house; and therefore turning back again, I hasted home with all the speed imaginable, and fell to knocking at the Door, as if I would have burst it in pieces; my Uncle called to know who was there, but through the fear I was in that they should arrive be∣fore I could have the door open, I was incapable of reply; so that continuing my
<PB N="26" REF="17"/> importunity, down he came, and began angrily to demand the reason of such rude∣ness: O! Uncle, Uncle, (said I, and thereupon fell to bolting and barrocading the Door, and setting my Back against it) the people are bringing a dead Man hither: Away you fool, said he, what, Art thou mad? A dead Man! quoth a, psha, psha, thou simple boy, sure thou art not so silly to believe it. Nay, nay Uncle, replyed I, I do believe it; for I am certain, I heard 'em say they were carrying him to a dark and sorrowful house, where there was neither eating nor drinking; and therefore they can me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n no other, but This.</P>
<P>At these words the old Man began to smile, yet scarcely knew whether he ought to be angry or pleased; yet in the end attributing it to my Simplicity, he by his sophistry soon convinced me of my mistake, and by that means removed my fear.</P>
<P><HI>At this Story</HI> Hawkwood <HI>could not refrain from smiling: But now the Cook giving notice by the ringing of a Bell, that Dinner was ready,</HI> Lovewell <HI>broke off his Discourse, with a promise after their repast to proceed.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Lovewell</HI> relates how he was met by a young Merchant-Taylor, who carried him to a splendid Feast, Annually held by the young Men of that Profession, on St. <HI>Wil∣lielmus</HI> Day, in honour of that Saint, so much esteemed by this Trade; And of the splendid Entertainment; And how he by that means came to be of the Trade.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The short Repast being ended, (for long you must not expect it to continue in a place where Commons are short, and Appetites exceeding large, so made by change of Air, and difference of the Climate)</HI> Hawkwood, <HI>desirous to hear more of the Adventures of him whom he now had adopted his Companion, was not wanting to put</HI> Lovewell <HI>in mind of his Promise, nor he less ready to satisfie his expectation; whereupon he thus proceeded:</HI></P>
<P>Long <HI>(said he)</HI> I had not been with my Uncle of the Gentle Craft, after the story I have mentioned, but growing weary of my Trade, (and more of my usage) and my Mother not coming to Town, as I expected, it so happened: As one day <HI>I</HI> went abroad, and was walking the streets, pensive and melancholly, I met with a dapper spruce fellow, who marking my Countenance, and by that guessing at the distur∣bance of my mind, bearing up with me, began to enquire into my Country, Paren∣tage, Business in Town, and finally my Name, with many more things and matters, too tedious to recite; of all which I satisfied him as well as I could; but it seems he knew them before as well as my self, happening in the sequel to be my Country-man and Neighbour. This Youth invited me to go along with him; but I, who had been terrified both by my Mother and Uncle, with the fear of being Spirited, the dread of <HI>Bugby's-hole,</HI> so much wrought upon my conceit, that with such Com∣plements as I had, I endeavour'd to excuse his invitation, by pretending business, and want of leisure: When indeed it was the same with St. <HI>Crispin</HI>'s Day, the on∣ly Holy-day my Uncle had allow'd me since my coming to me, and in generosity, for the sake of that Saint, so much admired by the Trade, had gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en me Three-half-pence to spend as I thought convenient, though withal admonishing me by the by, to lay it out in good Liquor, tipping me the wink, that that was the best way
<PB N="27" REF="17"/> to employ it: Now with this mighty Sum, and some other pence I had given me by Customers, I was going (you must know) to see a Country-man of mine; when in the end it happened to be the very Youth I had met as before, but so altered in his Clothes and Carriage, that I knew him not, (though I had heard where he lived) till he first discovered himself to me, and then we lovingly embraced each other, and (after the asking and answering many questions) I consented to accompany him; and stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghtway he led me to a place, where I found a great number of young Sparks in the height of merriment, who every one, upon my entrance rising from their respective seats, came and pay'd me a welcoming Complement. Now I, who knew not what all this should mean, stood like an Owl amongst the Jackdaws, and knew not what to say for my self; but he that brought me thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, supplyed my defect, and told them, I was an honest Country-man, though not of the same Pro∣fession: Then they demanded my Calling, which I frankly told them; upon which turning their Heads on one side, not utterly to dash me out of countenance, they fell to sn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckering for a while, but afterward made me sit down, and bid me heartily wel∣come; when on a sudden, all the Tables were spread with such store of Varieties, that at the sight thereof I stood gaping and gazing, as if I had been in another world; but recollecting my self, and seeing others fall to, I made no bones to do the like, and there fed not as the Country Esquire ordered his Man, for that day, or the morrow, but to supply the defect of many hungry Meals past, as never dreaming to meet with such another opportunity: Dinner ended, Wine of all sorts flowed about at a strange rate, and then entred the Musick. This, I thought with my self, was brave; but, being a stranger, <HI>I</HI> had so much wit at that time to think that silence best became me, and so I attended the sequel. When after many Carrouses and passing of Healths, a Youth with much gravity, having a Wreath of guilded Lawrel on his Head, rising at the upper end of the Table, silence was immediately commanded; when a while standing in a pause, he thus began:
<Q><L>YOU, who the First of Trades with Honour claim,</L>
<L>Whose Occupation in with <HI>Adam</HI> came,</L>
<L>And which improv'd was by <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s hand,</L>

<L>Think on the Day that gave First <HI>Edward</HI> Birth:</L>

<L>Then let none dare to slight us, since we prove</L>
<L>Antiquity, and <HI>England</HI>'s Monarch's Love.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon the recital of these Lines, every one gave a great shout; and so, after the going round of many Healths upon the former occasion, this Song ensued.</P>

<P>This Song ended, after much dancing and merriment, the Company broke up, and so, with many thanks, I took leave of my Country-man, but withal demanded the reason of this Meeting; who told me, it was Annually held by the young Men of that Profession, on St. <HI>Guillielmus</HI> day, in honour of him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so we parted; and from that very time I could never rest, till I had sent for my Mother to Town, and prevailed with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, to take me from my Uncle, and put me to this Trade.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>said</HI> Hawkwood, for what you have already revealed, I must in gratitude return you Thanks, though, as to some part of what you have last said, I would not have you to take me for a stranger to it, as having been a Member of this Annual Society: But waving other matters, for Brevities sake, seeing (as I remember, if I mistake not) you said you have been crossed in Love, and that That was the occa∣sion of your Undertaking to travel; let me intreat you to lay your further obliga∣tions upon me, in giving me some account of what passed or happened, as to That. <HI>To this</HI> Lovewell <HI>consented, and so proceeded in the Relation: As you will find it in the following Chapter.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>THe Love-Story being agreed upon, our new Adventurer, e're he could proceed, fetched a deep sigh; when as these words ensued:</HI></P>
<P>I obtained, <HI>said he,</HI> as you have heard, the favour of the good old Woman, my Mother, to be removed from my penurious Uncle of the Gentle-Craft, to one <HI>Live∣well,</HI> a Professor of Limb-trimming, and Brother to the Merchant-Taylors; by which removal I found my condition wonderfully altered; for now I had both Plenty and Ease, whereas before I had both Labour and Hunger: so that conclu∣ding my self a fortunate fellow, I soon grew expert at my Trade, striving by in∣dustry and behaviour to be profitable to my Master, and obliging to all: Nor (as I think) did my expectation fail me, especially in the main; so that in relyance upon my fidelity, I had leave to do what I list, and was all in all, in taking the Measure of such Customers as we dealt with; and indeed we had a very full Employment. Now it so happened, when I was just out of my time, amongst other young Gentlewomen (for amongst them lay the stress of our Trade) that came under my handling, there was one of the loveliest Creatures that I fancied I had ever beheld: In her Body nothing was wanting, that might render it compleat; her Complexion was fair; her skin as white and soft as the Down of Swans; the Round of her Face incli∣ning near to a perfect Oval; and though her Eyes were not the greatest, yet they possessed all that could be desired in loveliness, being quick, with mildness, and full of Love, that with a single glance they darted into my Breast all the Flames that sparkled in themselves; her Mouth in its kind was not inferiour to her Eyes, for being very little, it shut with Lips of unfading Vermilion, so that in its natural frame, it presented an Object not to be parallel'd for Beauty; and when again it opened either to laugh or speak, it alwaies afforded a Thousand new charms; and what has been said of her pretty Mouth, may likewise be said of her fair Hands, which by their nimbleness and dexterity in the smallest actions, seemed to embelish themselves; but more might be spoken of the soveraign Beauty of her Neck and Snowy Breasts, which appeared to be the Master-pieces of Nature: Her stature was not of the tallest, but such as could not chuse but please: And as for her Gait, Ad∣dress, and Presence, they promised so much, that nothing cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be more. This beauteous Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, I say, I had the happiness to wait on in her Chamber, being a Neighbours Daughter not far distant from our House, there to take measure of her whose pretty Waist not much exceeded a span; and from that hour her Eyes took measure on my Heart, glancing their Beams of Lightning from end to end, and kindled a Feaver in my Breast! <HI>And with that he fetched another sigh.</HI></P>
<P>Well <HI>said</HI> Hawkwood, (<HI>who at this description began to look pale, fancying it could be none but his</HI> Dorinda, <HI>but for that his Master only furnished▪ Men with Clothes,</HI> &amp;c.) And how did you order your matter afterward? Her Clothes being made (<HI>continued</HI> Lovewell) with all the Art and Dexterity I could use, the better to please, I carried them home, and as I wished, they were wonderfully liked; and
<PB N="30" REF="19"/> whilst she sed her fancy on the neatness of her Apparel, I feasted mine, even to Luxury, upon her lovely face, and so we both were pleased, but not the way at that time that I wished, though she told me, I had so well satisfied her, that she would make further use of me, as occasion required, and withal, offered me a piece of Mo∣ney for my diligence; whereby somewhat emboldened, (there being none to over∣hear us) under pretence of receiving the Coyn, I took her by the delicate hand, and giving it a gentle squeeze, with an amorous look that (no doubt) darted flame into her tender soul, said: Ah Madam, 'tis not this, but something else I would have, if I durst presume to ask it. Why, <HI>said she,</HI> if it be your money you want, if you have your Bill about you, let me see it, and I'le fetch it you straight. Ah! no, <HI>replyed I, and fetched a deep sigh,</HI> it is not that, but that which is more valuable to me than any thing upon Earth, that I have power to name. Why, what is it? <HI>(said she, speaking with a glance that sparkled goodness)</HI> prithee tell me, that I may know as well as you; it may be I may help you to it. With that growing yet more bold, I bending one Knee to the ground, and kissing her fair hand, breathed out in a soft tone these words, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Dear Madam, it is your leave to love you: Upon this she be∣gan to smile, and look earnestly upon me; but whilst I was with impatience expect∣ing her answer, in came her Mother, and broke off my Scene of happiness; so that out of hopes to say any more, or hear any Answer at that time, I departed; not without some glimmering of joy, to wait a more favourable opportunity: Only thus much by her Mothers coming I gained, to know her Name was <HI>Lamira,</HI> the fair <HI>Lamira,</HI> the charming sweet <HI>Lamira.</HI></P>
<P>And how (<HI>said</HI> Hawkwood) did you proceed after that? or What success had you? I was restless (<HI>replyed</HI> Lovewell) and uneasie for many days, plotting and contriving a hundred ways to gain an opportunity, to let her know the wound her Eyes had made, and in the end was so favoured by my Stars, that boldly adven∣turing, I put my self in an exceeding Rich Female-Garb, (being then young and Beardless) and so got admittance to speak with her, and found (when I had to her no little wonder discover'd my self) that she was not any ways averse; insomuch, that under the pretence of being one of her School-fellows, <HI>I</HI> had the opportunity of waiting on her, as often as (for fear of suspition) I found it convenient; and some∣times, with the good liking of her Parents, we went abroad together, on Foot, and in a Coach, sealing in conclusion each others Heart, in mutual vows, and the pro∣testations were over-and-above cast in, that Mankind is capable of expressing.</P>

<P>ANd now I thought my self as happy as man could wish, and seemed to look down upon the World with pitty, not imagining there was any felicity, but what was centered in my Heart. But when I was in the midst of this extasie, coming one day to visit my Mistris, I found her overwhelmed with sorrow, and that by the Tears she had shed, the Lustre of her sparkling Eyes were much impaired; whereupon in much surprize I asked the cause, as thinking she began to repent of what she had promised, but found the contrary, for her grief proceeded from the proposal of a Match, which her Parents highly approved, and strongly pressed her to consent to, in lucre of her large Estate, and that the Lover was no less enamoured than she was a∣verse. This struck me with a cold damp to the heart, and deadned all my Joys; but com∣forting her in the best manner, it was agreed between us, That to prevent the trouble of his nausious visits, and the danger that delay might breed, we should the following Sunday joyn our Hands, as Love had joyned our Hearts; and so with a kiss and amorous smile, I cheer'd up the beauteous face of fair <HI>Lamira,</HI> which before was clouded with anxiety and sorrow: But so it unfortunately happened, That when we were about to take our leave, in comes the new Lover, and having first saluted my Mistris, he fell
<PB N="32" REF="20"/> to doing the like to me, and from that, to the entertaining us with much impertinent discourse, especially about his Love to <HI>Lamira,</HI> and what Mountains she might expect, if she would condescend to his desire; entreating me at the same time, if I was mar∣ried, (as he believed by my Womanly Countenance I was) to let her know, in his absence, the many Joys that attended a Matrimonial Estate; which I faithfully promised to perform, and indeed any thing else that he could request, to be rid of his company, of which (as I well p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rceived) my Mistris was but too sick: Not that I feared such a Rival, had her Constancy been less, by reason he was not only old, but much deformed and impaired in his natural shape and conditions: And indeed, as I could wish, there came an hasty Messenger to inform him, his House was on fire; upon which, in much consternation and confusion, he abruptly took his leave; though in the end I perceived, by the Laughter of my Mistris, that this false Alarum was given by her advice, that we might have the better leisure and opportunity to proceed further in discourse about our Marriage; but that proved our misfortune: for an old Wench, whom <HI>Improspero</HI> had well bribed to sollicite his Cause, having out of curiosity to hear our Discourse, (contrary to our knowledge) hid her self behind the Hangings, &amp; perceiving by the earnestness of our Expressions, the repeated Vows of Constancy and Fidelity, together with the tender Embraces, Kisses, and Caresses, that passed between us, that such Love could not well proceed from meer Complement, or be consistent in One of the Female Sex to another; she, from that time began to suspect, there was more in it than so; and thereupon more narrowly watching my Behaviour, Gait, marking my Voice, Limbs, and other matters, and being a season'd Stick at Intreagues, she no longer doubted, but that I was not what <HI>I</HI> seemed; nor did she delay to acquaint <HI>Improspero</HI> with her Thoughts; who finding himself abused, as to the Relation of the Fire, soon after my departure returned, and he imparted as much to the Mother of the fair <HI>Lamira,</HI> who searching her Desk, unhappily found a Copy of Verses <HI>I</HI> had written in praise of her, and subscribed with my Name, and some other Papers that had passed be∣tween us: Nor was it long e're the Father was acquainted with what they had gathered by circumstances; so that the House was in a secret consternation; and my Mistris had no more time, than just to send me word, our Intreague was disco∣vered, before she was closely confined to her Chamber, under the guard and care of her that had betray'd us. This, you may well think, was killing News to me, and for a time made me almost beside my self; for now my disguise, I found, was no more available, but might rather confirm the matter; sometimes I thought to revenge the Treachery; at other times, how <HI>I</HI> might release my Mistris; and often burst out into Tears, to think that for my cause, and that for the sake of Love, so fair a Creature should be so roughly handled, and wished that any misfortune might have befallen me, so she was no partaker of it. And now my study was to gain intelligence, in which Room she was confined, resolving at any hazard to speak with, and comfort her in the best wise: Nor was it long e're I gained it from a little Youth, belonging to the House, whom I had found abroad, and tempted to the dis∣covery with divers trifles of no great value; but surveying the place at a distance, I found the access wonderful difficult; yet, What will not Love do, where it does truly center? I getting me the Skin of a Bear, with a Head so artificial, that much curiosity must be used in distinguishing it from that of a live one; and so fit I framed this covering for my purpose, that when I was wrapped in it, I seemed no other than the very Creature I represented; and so the succeeding night lay in Ambush, in
<PB N="33" REF="20"/> order to rush up Stairs, and force my Mistrisses Guards, whom I knew (through fear and dismay) would leave their Charge, and then presently discover my self to her, and convey her thence: But finding no opportunity to do this, by reason I could perceive none of the outward Doors open, <HI>I</HI> thought upon getting in at the Window, but found many of them strongly Barred with Iron; and so, whilst I began to despair of putting my Design in Practice, it luckily came into my Head, that if I could get to the top of the House, I might descend the Chimney, and by that means come into her Chamber; and upon this wild Adventure I resolved; but mistaking the Funnel, I happened into the next to it, where I found the old <HI>Cisly</HI> (with whom <HI>Improspero,</HI> it seems, had been carrousing in the absence of her Master and Mistris) fast asleep, with a winking Candle by her, and the Key in her Lap, which I taking up, lay'd aside my Hairy Garment, and unlocked the Cham∣ber, where I found her reading very pensive; at first sight of me she was surpri∣zed; but perceiving who I was, we embraced each other with all the endearing Caresses that within the Bounds of Modesty can be imagined, and then (like mourn∣ful Turtles) complained to each other of our hard Misfortune; she telling me how she had been pressed, and almost tired with <HI>Improspero</HI>'s nauseous Love; and how severe her Parents had been to her, in her strict restraint; what Threatnings they used, if she disobeyed; with many other matters: And withal, demanded how I got the liberty to be admitted; the which I giving her to understand, we in the end fell to plotting, how at that time we might escape, seeing Fortune had so far favoured my Enterprize; but in that found many difficulties: For the Father, Mother, <HI>Improspero,</HI> and the Lad, being gone to Supper at a Neighbour's House, had taken all the Keys of the outward Doors with them: Through the Windows we could not get, neither was it convenient, or possible, for my Mistris to clamber out at the top of the Chimney; wherefore the gagging or binding old <HI>Cisly</HI> (for so was the Wench called) we imagined, might prove as disadvantageous, as if <HI>Vlisses</HI> had killed the <HI>Polyphem:</HI> Wherefore cudgeling my Brains for a while, I at last re∣solved to make a Bug-bear of the Wench; and thereupon, as Fortune would have it, in the almost insensible condition she was in, I clapped my Bears-Skin about her, and so well buckled it on, (whilst she thought probably, that some body was wrap∣ping her in a Rugg, for fear of catching Cold) that now she appeared all over a Beast.</P>
<P>Having thus done, we went down Stairs, and bolted the Door on the inside, and so hid our selves in a Nook, or behind the Geaum of the Wall, to expect the event, and weather the utmost that might befall. Now so it fell out, that soon after the good People coming home, and not being able with their Keys to get Entrance, mistrusting somewhat more than ordinary, fell to knocking and thundering at the Door like Wild fire, which made old <HI>Cisly,</HI> between sleep and wake, after a yaun or two, stagger down Stairs in her Fur-Mantle, the which, by the reason of the con∣dition she was in, she did not perceive; but getting to the Door as well as she could, she opened it, by drawing back the Bolts; but no sooner did she appear in that frightful form, but those that were so hasty to enter, were hastier in the Retreat: <HI>Improspero,</HI> to seem valiant, supposing (at first) some Thieves were gotten into the House, drew his Sword; but old <HI>Cisly,</HI> who began to wonder at their running away, staggering after them, he no sooner beheld her, but seized with a panique fear, drop∣ping his Weapon, he betook himself to his Heels: During which const<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nation, I and my Dear <HI>Lamira</HI> had opportunity to depart undiscovered; to our (then) no small Joy and Satisfaction.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How they Landed in <HI>Ireland;</HI> with some Remarques upon that Kingdom: How they heard the false Accusation and malicious Stratagem of one <HI>Romaldus</HI> against <HI>Clarinda,</HI> because she had refused him, and given her Love to ano∣ther: And of the policy by which he contrived to put her Life to the hazard.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>DVring the long Love-Story and Adventure, the Ship was come within sight of Land, and the Sea running somewhat high, all hands were requi∣red, to bring her safe into the Port; which occasion'd the remainder of this Affair to be referred to a more convenient opportunity; and indeed, what remains may prove both pleasant and delightful in the Relation; which in due place I shall re∣member.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Being come nearer the Shore, they found themselves upon the Coast of</HI> Ireland, <HI>where they soon got on shore;</HI> Hawkwood <HI>and</HI> Lovewell, <HI>upon their Landing, kindly embracing each other; and so refreshing themselves with what the place afforded, and paying their Passage, they resolved to travel; and with them would go a pretty Youth (as they imagined him) who came over in the same Ship, but indeed (though contrary to the knowledge of either of them) it was the beautiful</HI> Lamira, <HI>disguised in Mans Apparel; as in the sequel will appear, to the no small Ioy of her Lover.</HI></P>
<P><HI>These Valiant and Ingenuous Youths being in the famous Kingdom of</HI> Ireland, <HI>in pursuit of Fortune's Favour, and taking the third person into their Society, they travelled through divers places, beholding many Rarities, which that Country affords, and amongst the rest, admiring that singular Gift, said (according to Tra∣dition) to be granted at the humble supplication of St.</HI> Patrick, <HI>their Titular Saint,</HI> viz. <HI>That no venomous Creature breeds there; and that if any happen to be carried over for curiosity's sake, they dye. And indeed, much notice is taken in that kind of the Roof of</HI> Westminster-Hall, <HI>said to be built of</HI> Irish <HI>Oak, seeing (notwithstanding the Antiquity of the Building) not so much as a Spider's Webb appears upon any part of the Wooden Frame; which in other Halls, built of the same sort of Timber, though not of the same Countrys growth, unless swept down, appear very numerous. But to wave this;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our generous Merchant-Taylors, I say, being in pursuit of Fame, and trusting to the favour of Fortune, resolving to gain Renown at what price soever it cost them, desiring nothing more, than to hear of some dangerous Adventure, by which Honour might be gained, and true Valour signalized; it so fell out, That being one Evening belated in their Travel, they came to a Gentleman's House in the Province of</HI> Conaught, <HI>publick Inns being but few in those parts, and of the Porter demanded whether they might lodge there that night; who told them they might, forasmuch as it was an Hospitable place, built for the Reception and Enter∣tainment of Strangers: and so he had them into the Hall, where they found not only good Company, but a Table spread with all manner of Provisions that Reason could require, and Liquors answerable, especially</HI> Usquebah, <HI>that reviving Cordial, so much used amongst the Natives of that Kingdom: And so having refreshed
<PB N="35" REF="21"/> themselves, they began to discourse about divers matters, and amongst other things, one of them began to relate the sad misfortune of a beautiful young Gentlewoman, not far distant from that place, who, by reason (as he said) of a false Accusation, was to be put to death, unless she could meet with a Champion, that would undertake to maintain her Innocence against her Accuser. This Story our valiant Youths were more than ordinary desirous to hear; insomuch, that silence being made, the Party thus proceeded:</HI></P>
<P>It so happened, <HI>said he,</HI> that an ancient Gentleman, called <HI>Ianthines,</HI> had by his Wife deceased, one only Daughter, named <HI>Clarinda,</HI> of Personage lovely and amiable, and in courteous and modest Behaviour excelling to a Wonder. This charming Maid no sooner arrived to that perfection of Years, which fully dis∣covered her excellent Features, but her Beauty captivated the hearts of many; but she prizing Virtue and true Valour more than Wealth, did not return them the satisfaction they so much desired, but (as it afterward came to light) settled her Af∣fections upon one, whose Fortune seemed obscure in the Eyes of the rest: Yet many of them finding by sundry Tokens, that their Loves were united to that degree, that it would be difficult (if not altogether impossible) for them to break the Chain, they all of them (except one, more wealthy and powerful than the rest, who thought to overbear him either by Gifts or stratagem) relinquished their pretensions: But in the end, this man finding the Beautiful and Virtuous <HI>Clarinda</HI> deaf to his Im∣portunities, endeavouring as much as in her lay, to shun and avoid him, being fraught with Malice, he turned the Love he protested for this beautiful Creature into Hatred and Revenge; yet fearing the Valour of his Rival, if he should attempt it against her by force, he conspires by Fraud, and in that he proceeded after this manner:</P>
<P>He finds an opportunity to contract a familiar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty with the Waiting-Woman of the beauteous <HI>Clarinda,</HI> insomuch, that through Gifts, and a promise of Marriage, she was wholly at his Devotion, even (as the Report goes) more than consisted with the Rules of Modesty; for passionately doating upon him, she suffered him, as often as opportunity did permit, to have his Freedom with her; though he in∣tended no other, than to serve his Revenge, by her Credulity, on the innocent <HI>Clarinda:</HI> So that taking his opportunity to meet with <HI>Bernardo,</HI> (for so was <HI>Clarinda's</HI> Lover's Name) he told him, That although his Happiness was great, in having a Virtuous Mistris, yet he was (as many others had been) very much deceived; for that, although she gave him many smooth Promises, yet in the mean while, she prostrated her Honour to another. Upon these words of <HI>Romaldus, Bernardo</HI> grew both angry and impatient, protesting with his Life to vindicate his Mistrisses Honour, and withal, calling him Traytor to his face; but he not daring to maintain what he said by force, against so Renowned a Warriour as <HI>Bernardo,</HI> pacified him with many smooth words; and having by that means brought him to a calmer Temper, he told him, If he would not believe it, he should the next Evening be a Witness of it himself, though he desired it might be at a distance, by the light of the Moon; for that, she had (as he secretly understood by some that were about her) appointed (as she usually did) her Lover to come, at a certain hour, who, by the help of a Rope-Ladder, which she promised to fasten to the Balcony, was to ascend to his Joy, and revel in her Arms all night.</P>
<P>This, though <HI>Bernardo</HI> could not well believe, yet hearing it spoke w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th such earnestness, and so well vouched, he consented, even for Curiosity sake, to attend
<PB N="36" REF="22"/> at the time appointed: And so it happened, That <HI>Romaldus</HI> having prevailed with the waiting-Woman, called <HI>Celinda,</HI> to attire her self in <HI>Clarinda's</HI> Clothes, and in the same Dress as she frequently went, that (as he said) he might heighten his Joys, by fancying her to be the same; he likewise ordered her to receive him in the Balcony, fastening (as he had determined) the Ladder, and she receiving him with such loving Carresses, feigning withal the Speech of <HI>Clarinda,</HI> so to the Life, that <HI>Bernardo,</HI> by the imperfect Light, and by reason of the distance, was alto∣gether deceived, and fell not only to exclaiming against his own Unhappy Fortune, but to blaming of her that was Innocent, in these expostulating Lines:
<Q><L>I Wake, and see what I could wish t' have been</L>
<L>Born without Eyes, that I might not have seen;</L>
<L>Or rather not to have been born. Curs'd Fate!</L>
<L>Why hast thou thus prolong'd my Life's sad Date,</L>
<L>To bring me to this killing Spectacle?</L>
<L><HI>Bernardo,</HI> more tormented than in Hell.</L>
<L>Dye then <HI>Bernardo</HI>— How, Dye! Dye, and give</L>
<L>My Rival leave my Ruin to out-live?</L>
<L>You that enjoy my Spoils, whoe'er you are,</L>
<L>Since I must fall, shall my Destruction share:</L>
<L>Let Death and Ruin guide me where he lyes,</L>
<L>To kill him in the height of all his Joys:</L>
<L>But is't not base to kill him by surprize?</L>
<L>What if her Wrongs I openly should right?</L>
<L>That wou'd proclaim the Cause for which we fight:</L>
<L>Dye basely then, whoe'er thou art that dare</L>
<L>Thus kill my Peace, and thus dishonour her;</L>
<L>I, but the Blood may, if I kill him there,</L>
<L>The Murther show, and that the Murtherer.</L>
<L>What need I care? Yes; but the Murther known,</L>
<L>Betrays the Cause for which the Murther's done.</L>
<L>But her stain'd blood has not so quench'd my Flame;</L>
<L>I'd kill her Guilt, but would not wound her Fame.</L></Q></P>
<P>And thus having with sighs and tears debated his Misfortune, he undertook to Travel into Forreign Lands, little perhaps knowing the Misery, and much less the Innocence of fair <HI>Clarinda;</HI> who being since accused by <HI>Romaldus,</HI> of what she is altogether innocent, in defect of a Champion that will undertake her Quarrel, is not only like to suffer shame and disgrace, but lose her Life: For though the Treachery has been discovered, it has not gained Belief; as being over-born by the Power and Asseveration of <HI>Romaldus.</HI></P>

<P>THE afore-mentioned Relation moving a tender compassion in the hearers, and <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> being further satisfied, that what had been said had been confessed by <HI>Celinda,</HI> upon her being rescued from two Ruffians, into whose hands <HI>Romaldus</HI> had put her, in order to her being made away, that so his treachery might be secure from discovery; they both at once protested to venture their lives on her behalf, and a long while strove and contended with each other who should under∣take the Challenger; but in the end <HI>Hawkwood</HI> gained the preheminency, &amp; so the next morning he departed, with the greatest part of the Company, who were desirous to see the end of this Affair, and came to the House of <HI>Janthines,</HI> which was filled with nothing but Mourning and Lamentations, for that the day of Combat was to be the next, and none had yet (to their knowledge) declared themselves in defence of the fair <HI>Clarinda;</HI> yet no sooner was <HI>Hawkwood's</HI> resolution known, but the face of things were changed, though some doubted the success: But however, being in∣troduced into the presence of the fair <HI>Clarinda,</HI> and approved by her as her Champion, she trusting more to her Innocence, than what she then fancyed in him of strength &amp; experience, a Horse and Armour, with Weapons, and other things, were provided
<PB N="38" REF="23"/> him; nor did the Father spare to promise him large Rewards: Of which <HI>Romaldus</HI> having notice, and being conscious of his own Guilt, made it his request to those that were to Marshal the Combat, that he might not fight alone; but that his two Brothers, whose Names were <HI>Cormondel</HI> and <HI>Grimsallow,</HI> might be allowed to enter the List against any Three, that should dare to undertake them. This (though very unreasonable) was (by reason of <HI>Romaldus</HI> great Power in those parts) allowed. Nor did <HI>Lovewell</HI> a little rejoyce, that such an opportunity of trying his Strength was offered: But the Youth (or rather young Lady) in Disguise, who went by the Name of <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> whom I must for a time so call, seemed much concerned thereat, and used many Arguments (not without Tears) to perswade him from it; but finding him resolutely bent to gain Honour, or lose his Life, stifling as much as in her lay, that outward grief, she sought a private place to vent it, in putting up her Prayers for him she esteemed dearer than Life. And now a Third Champion being wanting, these Two valiant Youths resolved to encounter the Three Brothers; and so early in the morning they entred the List, well mounted, and armed at all points; but then found another Knight in black Armour, and the Portraicture of a Virgin on his Shield, to Rank with them: by which means their number being equal, they rushed together with great fury, insomuch, that <HI>Romaldus</HI> and <HI>Cormondel,</HI> against whom <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> run, were beaten to the ground: And as for the other Two, their Launces breaking, shivered in the Air; but soon recovering, they drew their Swords, whereupon a dreadful Fight began, which filled the Spectators with Hope and Fear, according as they sided, or took part in their affections with either side; and for a while the Success stood doubtful: but <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> impatient of any long delay, laying upon the Shield of <HI>Romaldus</HI> with a forcible blow, smote it in sunder, and gave him a deep wound in the Left Shoulder; whilst <HI>Lovewell</HI> did much the like by <HI>Cormondel:</HI> Nor was the Champion in black Armour idle, but fiercely charged upon <HI>Grimsallow,</HI> verily believing him to be <HI>Romaldus,</HI> whose usual Armour he indeed had on. <HI>Clarinda</HI> and <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> who all this while beheld the Fight, were in a deep heaviness and anxiety, the one for her Honour, that were at stake, and the other for her Love, that was as dear as both: But <HI>Hawkwood</HI> soon gave them hope, by turning the Seale; for still pursuing <HI>Romaldus</HI> with a forcible blow, he burst his Helmet in sunder, and the Sword entering deep into his Head, he fell from his Horse, and greatly bruised himself in the Fall; so that whilst the other Four were hotly engaged, he alighting, clapped his Sword to his Breast, bidding him either confess the abuse he had done, or expect no longer Life; whereupon per∣ceiving his two Brethren dismounted, and much wounded, after having begged Mercy, he declared the Story from end to end, as it has been related, with greater aggravations, craving a Thousand Pardons for the wrongs he had done the fair <HI>Clarinda;</HI> and so the compassionate Lady, upon his humble submission, interceding for him, who had little deserved it at her hands, he had his Life given him; as also had his Brothers, upon the like submission, and their confessing a true sense of sor∣row for undertaking so unjust a Quarrel; and soon after (being recovered of their wounds) they for grief and shame left the Country; <HI>Celinda,</HI> the waiting-Woman being (after her delivery out of the Ruffians hands) fled, for fear of Punishment: And so the three Champions were with Triumph conducted to the House of <HI>Clarin∣da</HI>'s Father, where they were highly welcomed and applauded: So that now, instead of Mourning, nothing but Musick and Feasting was to be found. And what added yet more to the fair <HI>Clarinda's</HI> happiness, that upon the Champion in black Ar∣mour's
<PB N="39" REF="23"/> discovering himself, he proved to be <HI>Bernardo,</HI> who, for the Love he bore to his Mistris, (notwithstanding by what he had seen, he conjectured her false) came to vindicate her, and stand in the defence of her Cause with his Life: which old <HI>Jan∣thines</HI> understanding, (at the request of <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI>) resolving no longer to cross their Ioys, all things were prepared for the Marriage Solemnity, to that degree, that the like had not been known before in those parts; so that the Concourse being very great, after the Marriage-Solemnity was over, in joyning the two Lovers Hands, whose Hearts had been long-before united, the Feasting con∣tinued for the space of Ten days, with Balls, Plays, Tilts, and Turnaments; in all which <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> putting in for their parts, performed them to a wonder, and gained great Applause, especially of the Ladies, and young Gentle∣women, who enforced their Charms to the utmost, in hopes to captivate those Hearts, which were not in the owners power to bestow, as being already given away.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY this time <HI>Hawkwood</HI> understood, that <HI>Bernardo</HI> was one of his own Pro∣fession, raised by his merit to a good degree, and communicated as much to <HI>Lovewell,</HI> striving all he could to cheer him, who being frequently melancholly, for the supposed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sence of his dear <HI>Lamira;</HI> they the next day resolved to ride abroad for their better Recreation, having now not only Horses at command, but Arms and Armour suitable to their wish, and were not wanting to provide the like for <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> who was highly esteemed by them both, and appeared in the Eyes (especially of those young Gentlewomen that were deceived in the Sex) one of the loveliest Youths they had ever beheld; when coming to the Border of the Forrest, they heard a great cry, whereat they stood still to listen a while; but perceiving it to draw nea∣rer, or at least grow louder, they resolved to enter, especially finding a beaten way that passed through it: When as they had not gone far, e're they perceived several of the Gentry of the Country in pursuit of a monstrous Wolfe, which had destroyed many People and Cattel, and who had now not only scattered the Dogs, but killed and wounded many of them; which made some fearful Ladies, who accompanyed the men in the Chase, cry out, dreading upon the sudden turns he made, he would fall upon them: But <HI>Hawkwood, Lovewell,</HI> and <HI>Bernardo</HI> coming in, by their Courage and Resolution secured them from that fear, putting him to plain flight; for they having giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n him some wounds, and he perceiving himself over-matched, hasted away as fast as he could, without standing longer to contend; so that they (mindful of the Game, and in hot pursuit) left <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> who was not used to that Recrea∣tion, nor indeed to be so mounted in the intricate Mazes of the Forrest, who being weary, and not well knowing the way out, alighting, sate down by a pleasant Spring, and whilst the Horse grazed, or brouzed, upon the Trees, fell asleep upon a
<PB N="40" REF="24"/> Mossy Bank, enamell'd with Flowers of fragrant smell; when so it happened, a noble young Lady, who was returned from the Chase, came thither, and seeing so beautiful a Creature, could not at first believe it was mortal, till alighting from her Palfry, she with eager looks had taken a more serious view, and found the more she looked, the more her admiration encreased, thinking with herself, that if in steep such Charms appeared, how much more tempting must they be in their full Lustre; and so much enamoured was she, that she could not refrain from stealing a kiss; and upon that, fetched so loud a sigh, that <HI>Lorenzo</HI> opening her Eyes, was much surprized, to behold a beautiful Lady hovering (as it were) over her, with looks that declared a Languishment; and thereupon getting up, would have mounted, as fearing she was discovered, and that this might be some of her Relations, come in search of her; for, it seems, she had several Kindred in that Country, though indeed (as she remembred) she had never seen any of them: But, alas! the matter was far other∣ways, for the Lady being overwhelmed with a passion, (for a Beauty she had never beheld in Man, one of which Sex she supposed <HI>Lorenzo</HI> to be) she began to entreat and implore her stay, and so prevailed, that they sate down, together with the Lady whose Name was <HI>Lucrina,</HI> the fair and beautiful <HI>Lucrina,</HI> for which many a gallant Youth had sighed in vain, to divert the prevalency of her passion, began to talk of the Chase, and many other things that had happened, and were further intended for Recreation, still eying her with burning glances, not forbearing sometimes to fetch a deep sigh, which (no doubt) stole from her fair Breast before she was aware; which <HI>Lorenzo</HI> often perceiving, demanded the cause; at which <HI>Lucrina,</HI> no longer capable of stifling her passion, catching her about the Neck, and hanging down her Head, the better to hide her blushes, with a soft, but earnest tone, said: <HI>Ah! the cause is here, the sight of you, fair Youth, whoe'er you are, has made such an impression in my Breast, that forced by a prevailing passion, I must lay aside (forgive me Modesty) the silence of our Sex, and tell you I languish for the love of you, and could with Joy expect a suitable Return: Nor is she meanly b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn who woes you; but such a one as brings a Dowry not to be despised.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lorenzo</HI> knowing she was not furnished with Materials to answer the Ladies expectation, though she was a little surprized at this discourse, seemed to excuse the Favours she had thrown upon her, in her Praises and her Offers, but found her thereupon more urgent and pressing; so that not knowing what to say or do, unless she should discover her self, and undeceive the Lady, she (after pausing) imagined it not altogether amiss, to give her some Hope, and the rather, because she did not know but it might be a means to deliver her up into the Arms of some kind Youth, who could not only answer her expectations, but be proud of such a blessing; and so, with a promise to meet her the next day, &amp; in that shady place, to confer further of the matter lest too long a stay so many people being abroad, might occasion a discovery, &amp; that turn to a disappointment, <HI>Lorenzo</HI> (after many endearing Carresses) obtained her con∣sent to depart; and so mounting, soon (by enquiry) found the way to the House of <HI>Janthines;</HI> whilst the Lady took hers, to that of her Vncle, carressing her self be∣tween Hope and Fear; Hope, that the beautiful <HI>Lorenzo</HI> would keep the time ap∣pointed, and Fear that it might be neglected: However, construing things the most favourable, she passed the night in many pleasing thoughts, fancying, that if ever <HI>Adonis</HI> was found in the Woods, she had met with him now.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Lorenzo</HI> remembring her Promise, endeavoured by a Stratagem to gratifie the fair <HI>Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rina:</HI> And what thereupon succeeded, both Comical and Tra∣gical; With other things and matters of moment.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Adventure of the Lady being somewhat strange, though Love (as I have said) takes the Diadem from Queens, and where it is truly fervent, in spight of the nice and troublesome Laws of Modesty, and bashful Nature, or Restraint, will blow the Passion into a visible Flame; and so in this case it happened: Where∣fore <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> or the disguised <HI>Lamira,</HI> not being ignorant of the Promise that was made, after Supper was ended, began to cast about how she might satisfie <HI>Lucrina</HI>'s expectation, and come off with Honour; and not being willing to discover her self as to what she was, till a further opportunity required it, she thought not fit to acquaint any of those she termed her Companions, and whose Hearts she knew were taken up elsewhere, of the matter: But casting her Eyes (as she imagined) upon a handsome young Gentleman, newly arrived, whom she conceited somewhat to resemble her self, she resolved to let him know the Intreague; and withal, to tell him, if she had not been already engaged beyond recast, she would not have refused so worthy an Offer, but have esteemed it as a Favour, cast upon her by the smiles of Fortune: And so taking her opportunity, she discovered whatever had happened on that kind, together with the Promise she had made: But the supposed Gentle∣man being no more capable of pleasuring the Lady in her expectation, than her self, to her no small wonder, refused the Offer, without giving any reason for so doing; for indeed he was no other than the fair <HI>Dori da;</HI> who hearing of <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s Renown, and by this time weaned from her covetous disposition, repenting the hard usage she had given him, cast off her second Lover, and with such Treasure as she could conveniently convey away, was come in search of him in disguise.</P>
<P><HI>Lorenzo</HI> thus refused by the supposed Gentleman, resolved rather to go her self, than to break her word; but whilst she was considering on this point, withal wondering, that so Noble an Offer should be rejected, it came into her mind, that the Party who refused it, must undoubtedly be some such Adventurer as her self, or otherways be cold to love, if no pre-engagement had seized that Heart, which promp∣ted the Tongue to refuse to charming an Enterprize; and withal, she began to blush and condemn her self, for discovering the weakness, or rather the effects of <HI>Lucrina</HI>'s unfeigned love: Yet notwithstanding, at the Time and Place appointed they met, and there renewing the former Discourse, at the wondrous importunity of the amorous Lady, whose Discourse Love shaping in a Thousand extravagant Expres∣sions, it was agreed, that for the better secresie, the Nuptials should be solemnized the Evening of the next day; <HI>Lorenzo</HI> knowing, that if no other way was found to colour the Design, it would prove but a frolick in the end; and so <HI>Lucrina</HI> pro∣mising to give necessary Orders to a Nurse of hers, who lived some distance from her Vncle's House, and in whom (by reason of the many Obligations she had layd upon her) she doubted not, but she might confide; they parted.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="25"/>
<P>The Ladies being separated, it so fell out, that <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> in the way to <HI>Jan∣thine</HI>'s House, being thoughtful of the Intreague, (whilst the fair <HI>Lucrina,</HI> no doubt, was in as large a Contemplation of her approaching bliss) overtook a young Gentle∣man very pensive and sad, upon whose Face sorrow had made visible impressions, and whose sighs betrayed his inward grief; the cause of which (after the usual Complement, and some enquiry into the Affairs of the Country) she demanded; but he put it off with many excuses, till being pressed beyond any reasonable cause of Refusal, after a sigh, he thus began to breathe out his sorrow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I being</HI> (said he) <HI>born in</HI> England, <HI>at</HI> London, <HI>the Famous</HI> Metropolis <HI>of that Kingdom, and having but one only Sister, whom indeed I scarcely knew, being separated from her by my Parents, when she was very young, and sent abroad to travel the World; upon my return home, I found them in Tears; and thereupon enquiring the cause, was informed, that the loss of that Sister was the occasion; who, by a strange Adventure, (the particulars of which they could not tell) had made her escape, or was otherways conveyed away they knew not how; though they imagined it was for the sake of one</HI> Lovewell, <HI>who (in Female Disguise) had courted her, and from whose company she was restrained: Where∣fore, the better to comfort them, I undertook to travel in search of her, but hitherto have been unsuccessful.</HI></P>
<P>This Story made all the blood in <HI>Lorenzo</HI>'s Body, flush in her Face: Yet recol∣lecting her self, and finding he knew her not, she plucked up a courage, and said: <HI>Well Sir, and Is this the cause of your grief? Perhaps that Sister of yours may in a short time return home, or you may happen to find her, nor is it impossible, but I may further you in this matter, at least ways accompany you in the search; therefore Up Sir, and be not thus discontented. Ah!</HI> (said the disconsolate Gen∣tleman) <HI>if this was all the cause of these Clouds of Sorrow, that damp and oversha∣dow my Joys, (though this, you'l say, is great enough) my Spirits could not sink so low; but there is more, and more perhaps than I am willing to reveal.</HI> And here a sigh interrupted his further utterance.</P>
<P><HI>Lorenzo</HI> perceiving this, began more and more to press him to a discovery: When having a long time kept silence, and struggled with his passion, as loath to discover the mighty Secret, at last with a sigh, as though his Heart would break, these words burst from him: <HI>Ah!</HI> (says he) Lucrina, <HI>the fair and lovely</HI> Lucrina<HI>'s killing Eyes have robbed me of my Peace.</HI> And thereupon hanging down his Head, some Tears trickled from his Eyes; whereat <HI>Lorenzo</HI> moved to compassion, began in the best wise to comfort him, not a little inwardly rejoycing at what she had heard; and when she found him a little come to himself, she made so strict an enquiry into the matter, that she found he had seen this beautiful Lady, but had never the happiness (either through fear or opportunity) to speak to her, or reveal that Passion, which her fair Eyes had kindled in his Breast, promising him in this case some assistance, for which he returned a thousand Thanks, and implored Ten thousand Blessings: But she fearing, that by some words that might drop, about the Sister he was in search of which she knew to be her self, and whereby <HI>Lovewell</HI> might be startled, she carried him to another House, resolving to stay with him till the Intreague was accomplished: Nor did they delay, but went on discoursing about this important Affair; our young Gentleman desiring nothing more, than to hear what <HI>Lorenzo</HI> had to propose, suspending his thoughts between Hope and Fear; and so it happened in the end.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>
<P><HI>Germander</HI> (for so he was named) being now in the Company of his beautiful Sister, though to him unknown, they went to a Shepherd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House, not far from that where <HI>Lucrina</HI> had appointed the Meeting, and contented themselves with such homely Fare as the Cottage would afford; where <HI>Lorenzo</HI> (for so we must yet call the fair <HI>Lamira</HI>) having understood from him the great concern her Parents were in, for her absence, and many other things relating to his Travels, and the Affairs of divers Countries, she told him the whole Story of the amorous In∣treague; how the fair <HI>Lucrina</HI> found her, and what had passed between them, not forgetting the Promise she had made; whereat <HI>Germander</HI> imagining himself lost for ever, as to the gaining her Love, looked pale as Death, and scarcely with all the Courage he had left, could support himself from falling in a swound: but continu∣ing her discourse, as she had brought him near the Grave, or Pit of Despair, so she in the end exalted his Thoughts above the Clouds of common Ioy: Scarcely could he believe she was in earnest; scarcely could he believe that any Engagement could hinder her from embracing so great an Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; but being by her protestations better satisfied, he fell at her feet, and in token of inexpressible Thanks, kissed the Ground whereon she trod; and so spending that Evening, and the next Day, in discoursing of the charming Theam, it was agreed; That being so like each other, (as indeed they were, as much as the difference of the Sexes would admit) that they should change Habits, and that <HI>Germander</HI> being informed of all that was past, that so no scruple nor doubt might arise in any doubtful Answer, should proceed to possess the fair <HI>Lucrina.</HI> At the thoughts of which, how great a Ioy he conceived, I leave to the imagination of those that love so much as him, and would be gratified therein. And so leaving <HI>Lorenzo</HI> at the Shepherd's House, in expectation of the News of her Brother's success, I shall return to our other Adventurers.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>LOrenzo</HI> being by this time much enquired for, by <HI>Hawkwood, Lovewell,</HI> and the rest, who by reason of their entertaining and discoursing with their new-come Guest, the fair <HI>Dorinda</HI> (who went by the Name of <HI>Orlando,</HI> and whom for some time I must, as occasion serves, so call) did not miss her till the second day; but then notice being given, that <HI>Lorenzo</HI> went out early the day before, and that she had been seen entring the Forrest, and no Tydings (though some had been sent out to make enquiry) heard, they began to make many conjectures of different natures; but in the end, at the motion of <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell,</HI> it was agreed, they should ride in search of that fair Companion; which they did, in com∣pany of others, a long time; but finding the ways different, or passing too many places at once, they resolved to divide; when far they had not gone, or separated
<PB N="45" REF="26"/> from each other, but <HI>Hawkwood</HI> heard at a distance not only the clashing of Arms, and Armour, but the shriek and out-crys of a Woman, to which he directed his Course with speed, and found on the edge of the Forrest, just entering upon a great Plain near to a small Cottage a Gentleman, grievously wounded, yet defending himself (though feebly) with his Sword against Sir Men; whilst Three more held, and rudely handled (as appeared by her dishevel'd Hair and torn Garments) a beau∣tiful Woman, overwhelmed with sorrow, and struggling for Release, which made him with the greater speed make up to them, resolving at any rate to succour the Distressed; when looking earnestly upon t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wounded Gentleman, he verily con∣jectured him to be no other than <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> for so like were the Brother and Sister, (as I have said) that on a sudden it would be much difficult to distinguish them; and therefore being in a great fury to see him so dealt withal, he covered him with his Shield, by interposing between him and Death, and cryed out, <HI>Villains, What me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns this Cruelty, this Ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>len<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to my Friend? Slaves</HI> (said he) <HI>you shall Repent.</HI> And thereupon, whilst they began to scoff at him, and call him presump∣tious Mad-man, drawing his Sword, he with redoubled fury charged upon the foremost, and by a forcible blow beat him from his Horse, and layd him on the ground for dead; which the rest perceiving, and thinking with themselves to re∣venge that Injury, charged all a Front, and layd upon him many heavy strokes, but the Passage not being verywide, he manfully defended it, &amp; so dealt with them, that his Fury encreasing, he not only made them give back, but brought Three of them (through wounds and loss of blood) into so feeble a condition, that they were lit∣tle capable of defending themselves, and less of endamaging him; when as those who held the Lady, perceiving his more than Manly force, left their Charge, and came to the rescue of their fellows: Now, by this time, <HI>Hawkwood</HI> (through a wound he had received in the Shoulder) by the loss of much blood, losing of his Strength, though not of his Courage, it so happened, that a cross Lane, which <HI>Lovewell</HI> had taken, brought him directly to that place, who seeing one of his Friends, as he supposed him, (taking him, as <HI>Hawkwood</HI> had done, for no other than <HI>Lorenzo</HI>) disabled, and the other engaged, without speaking any word, fell in like Lightning, and so striving to emulate or exceed each other; whilst the Lady, freed from the Tyranny of her Guard, was binding up the Gentlemans wounds, <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> having layed the greatest part of them for dead, made the rest submit to their mercy, and upon their Knees beg their lives, and them at the intercession (which was more than they deserved) of <HI>Lucrina.</HI></P>
<P>Our Champions having thus subdued their Opposers, had now time to enquire into the cause of this unequal Encounter, and were given to understand, by one of those they had overcome, That <HI>Lucrina</HI> having put too much confidence in the faithfulness of <HI>Canida</HI> her Nurse, in this Affair of her Love, she had from time to time betrayed the Secret to one <HI>Signior Ormasdes,</HI> and he, in revenge of being slighted, had caused this Ambush to be layd, to intrap the Lovers, with strict Command to kill the Gentleman, and bring the Lady to his Bed by force: But the design (continued he) being unjust, our Fortune proves the worst, though in∣deed no more than we deserve; yet something in the midst of our sorrow mitigates our woes, that is, that we have met with Honourable Conquerors, Men that knew how to shew pitty on those they had subdued; and the rather (he said) they hoped to find that Grace, because what they had done, was at the Command of their Lord, whom they durst not disobey.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>
<P>By this time the fair <HI>Lucrina</HI> having bound up <HI>Germander</HI>'s wounds, came to return (as did her Lover) <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> Thanks, stiling them their Deliverers, and would have bowed to embrace their Knees, but they would not suf∣fer it, but comforted them in the best wise, excusing (as the time would permit) the Praises and Thanks they heaped on them, telling them, they were ever ready to right (as far as in them lay) those that were wronged, and more especially, to vin∣dicate the Cause of Lovers, demanding withal of <HI>Lucrina</HI> who this <HI>Ormasdes</HI> was, who told them, with a sigh, and tears standing in her fair Eyes, That indeed there was such a Man living in a Castle not far distant from her Vncles, who had solicited her Love, but being of a bloody and cruel disposition, she had not only shun∣ned his company, but denyed him Access; for which, she believed, he had practised with <HI>Canida</HI> (in whom she confided) to compass her Ruin; <HI>But</HI> (said she, clasping <HI>Germander</HI> in her snowy Arms) <HI>O! my Love, I had not regarded so much this Treachery to me, but that for my Cause such mischief is befallen you: <HI>I</HI> wish</HI> (said she, in the transport of Passion) <HI>that I had dyed, e're I had put your life into this hazard.</HI> And thereupon looking pale, she had fell to the ground in a swoun, had he not stayed her in his Arms, and revived her with many comfortable words, and pro∣testations of the most entire Affection. Nor did <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> less endeavour to comfort them both, with the assurance of their protection against what∣ever might happen, even to the loss of their Lives; but they fearing the conse∣quence, (especially <HI>Germander,</HI> who imagined his Lady, upon seeing <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> might discover her mistake) desired them only to favour them so far, as to accom∣pany them to the next Port, there to take Shipping for <HI>England;</HI> which according∣ly they did, and there solemnly taking leave, they set sail, and with a prosperous Wind, soon arrived there, with much Riches, such could as be carried. Where I shall leave them, in the possession of those Ioys that true Love affords, till the rest of our Adventurers find them in that Tranquility.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Ormasdes</HI> hearing of the havock that was made of his Men, vowing Revenge, met <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> returning from the Sea-shore; And how in the Fight with the former, he was beaten from his Horse, and left for dead: And how <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and his Company left the Land; With other matters.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>HAwkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> having left the wounded men to shift for themselves, some of them that yet had Life and Strength crawled away, as well as they could, to the House of their Master, who with impatience was expecting their Re∣turn, and to his no small amazement, related what had befallen them, saying, That they had met (as they thought) with Devils in the likeness of Men, who came out of the Wood upon them, with such fury, that they were no ways able to make re∣sistance, but rather to shift for their lives. This did not a little disturb <HI>Ormasdes,</HI> who immediately fell to calling them Cowards, Villains, and a Thousand other course Names, vowing himself to pursue them immediately, and take Revenge: And
<PB N="47" REF="27"/> thereupon calling for his Horse, and Arms, notwithstanding the perswasion of many to the contrary, commanding, upon pain of death, that none should follow him, for that the Glory of so brave an Attempt should solely redound to himself: Nor long was it, e're he met our <HI>English</HI> Champions returning from the Shore, and knew them, by the description he had of them; whereupon, not standing to parly with many opprobrious and reproachful words, he charged upon the foremost (which was <HI>Hawkwood</HI>) with a huge Battel-Axe, and gave him such a blow, that he had almost beaten him from his Horse; whereupon <HI>Lovewell</HI> advanced to the assistance of his Friend; but <HI>Hawkwood</HI> perceiving it was but Man to Man, en∣treated him to desist, and not to eclipse his Honour; and so having his Sword drawn, and not being used to such rough Treatment, he returned that stroke with such redoubled force on the Helmet of <HI>Ormasdes,</HI> that he broke it in sunder, and the Sword entering deep into his Head, he fell from his Horse in a deadly swound; when taking his Battel-Axe, as a Trophy of the Conquest, they left him in the care of one of his Servants, who (notwithstanding his Threats) had adventured to follow him at a distance: And so coming to the House of <HI>Janthines,</HI> they found all their Company returned, and amongst the rest <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> which made them the more wonder, because they verily believed, the Gentleman they had rescued from Death, was the same; and so proceeded to tell all that had befell them, to the no small Wonder of those that heard it; and by which <HI>Lorenzo</HI> perceiving her Brother was safe, and had his desire, by her contrivance, she resolved to reserve the Secret to a further opportunity: But both she and <HI>Orlando,</HI> being fearful for their Lovers, (who feared not for themselves) lest greater mischief might happen, they suffered them not to rest, till with pregnant Reasons they had prevailed with them, to leave that Coast; and so taking leave, with large Rewards, and a Thousand Thanks, they were unwillingly dismissed; yet not till they were safely on Shipboard, fur∣nished with whatever Necessaries were convenient, to serve them in their Voyage to what Land they pleased.</P>
<P>Being thus on board, where little Adventure could be expected, whilst the Sailors stood for the Coast of <HI>France, Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>well</HI> suffered the Thoughts of their love not a little to disturb them, the one complaining of Vnkindness, and the other of the loss of her who loved him as her Life; regretting at nothing more, than that hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf had been the occasion of her troub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; little dreaming, either of them, that they were so near their Havens of Happiness: Nor wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Ladies, resolving to try the Constancy of their Lovers, seeing so fair an opportunity, offer (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet) to discover themselves, ever conceiving to give them such an unexpected Happiness, that the Ioy might be the greater. But <HI>Hawkwood</HI> having heard how the fair <HI>Lamira</HI> was gained, became now impatient, to understand how she came to be so soon lost; and thereupon (whilst the two supposed Gentlemen were retired in∣to their Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, who by this time understood each other so well, that they contracted a strict Amit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) made it his Request to his Friend, that he would let him know that part of his misfortune, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omising withal his assistance, as far as it was in his power, to serve him with his Life and Fortune, in search of her; and urged it in such an obliging manner, that the other, not able to deny him, thus began:</P>

<PB N="48" REF="28"/> to dye, rather than lose a Jewel of so great a value as my</HI> Lamira: <HI>Whilst, I say, Night wrought this Terrour, and we fled apace, resolving with all speed to leave the land, that in another Country we might enjoy the quiet Possession of each others Hearts, by turning as many Mazes as</HI> Dedalus's <HI>Labyrinth contained, or fair</HI> Rosamond's <HI>resplendent Bower, not Hand in Hand, but single, the less to be per∣ceived; in those fatal Turnings, Oh! Heart-breaking sound, we doubtless took different ways; for long it was not, e're I miss'd my dear delight; in vain I search∣ed, and softly cryed, Where are you, dear</HI> Lamira? <HI>speak: Nor from that time has any corner of the land been left unsearched, though to no purpose; wherefore I resolved to seek in other lands, but hitherto have been succesless; yet my life must be a Pilgrimage, unless I find her, in hope of whom I live, and for whose loss her Parents are in Tears, and made as vain a search as I.</HI></P>
<P>This sorrowful Story did not a little afflict <HI>Hawkwo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> who had not spared to tell <HI>Lovewell</HI> all his Adventures of the like kind. And so comforting each other they continued their Voyage.</P>

<PB N="49" REF="28"/> Ship mounted on the Waves, and often sunk as low, so that sometimes the Main-Mast seemed to touch the Clouds, and at other times seemed hidden under Waves, so that the Keel was supposed to bed upon the Sands; whilst the Crys of the Saylors made things seem more terrible, for nothing but Death and Ruin stood before their Eyes; at which indeed the Ladies trembled, and wished they had not left the former Coast; but our two Champions scorning Danger, cheered the rest, as <HI>Caesar</HI> did the Boatsman, with his Fortune: When so it happened, that after twelve houres con∣tinuance, the Winds were out of breath, and all the Sea grew calm; but when they perceiving Land, and thought themselves to stand with the Shore of <HI>France,</HI> they found that by the force of the Tempest they were driven off, to a small Island, or rather Rock, in the Sea, uninhabited, but by Pirates and Sea-Rovers, which so terrified the Master (apprehensive of the danger they were in of being taken) that now not only he, but all the Mariners trembled, more than in the storm, and were (for that the Vessel seemed much disabled) about to leave her, and make their escape in their long-Boat, chusing (as he said) rather to trust to the mercy of the Waves, than those merciless Thieves; but <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> having comforted their Companions, forbid it, and with their Swords cut away the Boat, and let her fall off, to prevent their flight; which was no sooner done, but the Pirate Spies having given notice from above, two Ships came out from the Harbours, between the Clifts of the Rock, and made up with full Sail, in hopes of a Prize; whilst <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> prepared themselves to receive them, animating the Master and Sailors to do the like, who by their example took up Arms, resolving rather to dye, than to submit to the barbarous usage they were like to find, if taken; so that when the Pirates (as their way is) thought to clap them on board, and over-power them with the number of their Men, they found themselves much mistaken; for our Champions having placed themselves in the most advantageous places of the Vessel, so layd about them, that lopping off Hands, Arms, and Heads, whilst the Master and Sailors taking Heart by their Examples, and doing their utmost, the Sea was coloured with Blood; and after a dreadful Fight, the Pirates would have fled, but th ir Vessels being fast grapled, and finding the destruction encrease, (for now those that thought to have boarded, were boarded themselves) most of them leaped into the Sea, where some were drowned and others getting to shore, hid themselves among the Rocks and craggy plates: When as <HI>Hawkwood,</HI> upon the examination of such as were still breathing on board, understood, that in the Cave of the Rock, there were a great many poor wretches in misery, which they had taken at sundry times, with an intent to sell them for Slaves, as opportunity gave them leave; he resolved to Land, and at what hazard soever to deliver them: When coming (toge∣ther with <HI>Lovewell</HI>) to the place, by the guidance of one of the wounded Pirates, whom he took on shore, he found those that guarded them (upon notice of the defeat) were fled into the inaccessible places of the Rock, by not well-known ways: Wherefore contenting themselves to free and take aboard with them those miserable wretches, that lay in Chains, Cords, and Torture, half naked, and almost starded, bearing the severe marks of their cruel usage; together with much Treasure and Merchan∣dize, they returned; and having fired the Pirates Ships, that they might have no advantage of them, with a fair Gale they stood for the Coast of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance,</HI> and soon come safe to Land, where they not only provided Cloaths and Provision for those they had delivered, but upon the sale of the Merchandizes, divided a great part amongst them, to enable them to travel into their own Countries, being of divers Nations;
<PB N="50" REF="29"/> for amongst them (to <HI>Hawkwood</HI>'s no small wonder) he found <HI>Impolito,</HI> his <HI>quon∣dam</HI> Rival, who (in his passing the Seas) had been taken by these Pirates; him he supplyed out of pitty, and a relenting of the hard-dealing he had given him in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> gratified him above the rest, and sent him home with a Letter to his Vncle <HI>Gaspero,</HI> with a Charge to deliver it to his own Hand, importing the Adventure of the Mad-house, and what had befell the Ruffians, subscribing it with his Name, and inserting many other matters he had learned from <HI>Impolito:</HI> And so, without making known to any other who he was, he dismissed him, in a Vessel ready to set sail, who (upon his arrival) did as he was directed, to the no small admiration of <HI>Gaspero,</HI> who for sorrow, shame, and vexation, soon after fell sick, and dyed.</P>

<P>OVr Champi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns being now in <HI>France,</HI> and hearing of a great Tournament to be held, at the celebration of the Nuptials of a Noble-Man's Daughter, they (having dismissed the Vessel, and well rewarded the Master with the spoiles of the Pirates, and other things of value) address'd themselves thither, with their beauti∣ful Associates, whom they had all-along perceived to be so much concerned, as not to refrain shedding Tears, when their Entreaties could not restrain them from at∣tempting any thing of danger, and often they fancied they had seen one or the other of them before, but where, they could not well imagine; they often likewise had dreamed (with no small Ioy) that they were discoursing with their Mistrisses;
<PB N="51" REF="29"/> and so, in these and other pleasant Conceits, they at last came to the place where the Sports were appointed, and there they found not only a Noble and Illustrious Assembly of spectators, of either Sex, but the Knights (Challengers, in honour of their Mistrisses) daring the Combat; which made <HI>Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Lovewell</HI> rejoyce, as not desiring a more favourable opportunity to express how much they loved; so that pausing a while, and perceiving none in a readiness to undertake them, they boldly entred, against whom two of the Knights prepared, and meeting in a full Career with their Launces, they shivered them in the Air; yet so forcibly <HI>Hawk∣wood</HI> bore on with the Truncheon of his Launce, that he tumbled him that run against him to the ground; but he soon mounting, they drew their Swords, (as did <HI>Lovewell</HI> and the other, who had passed in a full Career) and skirmished with such fury, that the two Knights Armour being broken, and themselves having re∣ceived some wounds, and more bruises, threw down their Swords, in token of yiel∣ding; when as two others advanced, but were no better welcomed; so that in the end, they kept the List alone, none daring adventure against them, supposing them more than Men, which caused the Tour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey to cease: After which, they were invi∣ted by the Noble-Man to his House, and with high Applause magnificently enter∣tain'd; the young Ladies that were come thither to the Solemnity, and beholding their Manly Beauty, when unarmed, not refraining to express an extraordinary Esteem of their Magnanimity and true Heroickness, but by their Eyes and Gesture let them see their Passion went further: Which <HI>Lorenzo</HI> and <HI>Orlando</HI> well noting, and fearing that among so many Beauties, some might fire their Affections, seeing they (as yet) were in little hope of enjoying those they desired, they thought it high time to call them off; and therefore, having made both their Sex and the Mystery of their Loves known to each other, they resolved to write each of them a Letter, as from <HI>England,</HI> and to have them delivered (as such) to a trusty Messenger, whom they would over-and-above bribe to silence, that so, by that means, they might im∣mediately pass thither, and by making themselves known in their proper Habit, make their Lovers happy: <HI>Lorenzo</HI> now not fearing (at the intercession of her Brother) to gain her Parents consent; and <HI>Orlando</HI> knew well, that hers would rejoyce at nothing more, than so happy a Conjunction. And so this way of disco∣very was resolved upon, and indeed succeeded to their wish; as in the following Chapter will appear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="24" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How upon their returning to <HI>England,</HI> they found <HI>Lorenzo</HI> and <HI>Orlando</HI> to be <HI>Lamira</HI> and <HI>Dorinda;</HI> and the means by which they were deceived: And how they were married by the Consent of their Parents, lived and dyed happy; with other things; as their being Knighted; with their further Atchievements.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Letters being filled with so many known Circumstances, and in the known Hands, upon sight thereof our Champions were struck with much amazement, and to ask further in relation to them, they knew not where, or of whom, seeing they were delivered by an unknown hand, and that the Messenger, as soon as he had
<PB N="52" REF="30"/> delivered them, had withdrawn himself, they knew not whither; so that having consulted each other, and finding the circumstances on either hand wonderfully coherent, Ioy and Doubt, or Fear, struggled so much in their Breasts, that they scarce knew what to conclude; but in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e end resolving to omit nothing that might render them so much felicity, as so fair an opportunity promised, they concluded to run the hazard of crossing the Seas, having directions where to come; and so much they communicated to the disguised Ladies, entreating them that they would bear them company, who (after some Excuses in relation to the danger they had been in at Sea before, and what might further happen) consented: And so taking leave of <HI>Gonzalus,</HI> the Noble-Man, and his Family, who dismissed them with Rewards, and many signal Favours of Love and Applause, with a prosperous Gale, they arrived in <HI>England,</HI> not only in gallant Apparel, but stored with Iewels and Gold, and hasted to <HI>London,</HI> where their Mistrisses pretended to lye concealed, in expectation of their arrival; where the business being layd by the two disguised Ladies, with the Wo∣man of the House, who was a Kinswoman of <HI>Lorenzo,</HI> or <HI>Lamira,</HI> for so I must shortly call her, she procured them costly Female Attire, pretending the mean while to our impatient Lovers that they were a day too soon, for that the Ladies had not promised to be there till the day ensuing: And so after much feasting and rejoycing, all things being now provided, the disguised Ladies the next morning assumed them∣selves, by putting on their proper Habits having in their other Habits pretended, that the same morning they would go abroad to see the Town.</P>
<P>Matters being brought to this pass, and Fate resolving no longer to withstand the Happiness of our Lovers they were introduced into the Chamber where their Mistrisses sate in sumptuous Attire, at the first sight of whom they were struck with such amazement, that they could sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce believe, but that it was rather a plea∣sing Vision, than true; but when they were throughly convinced of the reality, and made sensible of all that had happened, What Tongue can express the Ioy and Won∣der that at once surprized them? And now being no longer doubtful of each others Constancy, they embraced in fold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms of Love, with all the reciprocal Ioy ima∣ginable, having a Thousand tender things to say at once, which forcing one upon another, even stopped the passage of their Voices, and left them to sigh out the grea∣ter part; insomuch, that <HI>Dorinda</HI> had at that time no power to excuse her hard-heartedness; nor <HI>Lami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> to test how (after she was separated from him in the night) she procured of that Cousin of hers Man's Apparel, to go in search of him; nor how she luckily happened to enter the Ship where he was, and finding her disguised Ha it, shrouded her from his knowledge; nor many things more: But when this extasie was over, fear so wrought, lest they might again be crossed, they resolved to tye the Knot too fast for any but Death to sunder. But the Cousin undertaking to bring it about, with the Parents, that they should give their Consent, she instantly sent to invite them to her House; where finding what they little expected, they with Tears of Ioy embraced their Daughter; and being made fully sensible of all that had hap∣pened, freely consented, That as their Hearts was joyned; their Hands should not be kept asunder: So that the Ceremony being performed in the presence of a great number of worthy persons a Feast of ten days ensued, with such Mirth and Iollity, as beseemed the consummation of so great a Happiness. Nor were <HI>Gilbert</HI> and the fair <HI>Lucrina</HI> wanting, to express the many obligations they had laid upon them; nor less did she wonder, when she knew how she had been mistaken; yet not repen∣ting of what she had done. Songs and Musick, with all manner of Varieties, spoke
<PB N="53" REF="30"/> the welcome of the Guest, who resorted from all parts, to behold these Miracles of Constant Love.</P>
<P>The Solemnity and Feastival being over, whilst the whole Kingdom rung of their Constancy and Fame, they provided them Houses, and lived in great Splendor, encreasing in Riches, and in the Love of All; so that coming to great Preferment, and behaving themselves couragiously in the Wars abroad, for the Honour of their Country, and in their great Offices and Trust at home, <HI>John Hawkwood</HI> and <HI>Fran∣cis Lovewell,</HI> for their good Services, received the Honour of Knighthood, carrying afterward the Fame of true <HI>English</HI> Valour into many Lands; and being blest with a happy Off-spring, ended their days in Peace, and left their Memories blessed to Posterity.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>OR, A Recital of several Worthy, Magnificent, and Charitable Acts of the <HI>Merchant-Taylors,</HI> as they are found upon Record, and visibly extant, to the no small Honour of that Worshipful Society, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving delivered a History in it self, (as I take it) not a little pleasant; I shall now come to a more serious Relation of many things worthy of note, which I have chosen to fix as an Appendix, not think<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng it so convenient, to bring it into the foregoing Pages; which take as followeth:</P>
<P>The Worshipful Company of <HI>Merchant-Taylors</HI> have been a Guild or Fraternity time out of mind, by the Name of <HI>Taylors,</HI> and <HI>Linnen-Armourers:</HI> For I find, that <HI>Edward</HI> the First, in the 28th. Year of his Raign, confirmed this Guild under the Names aforesaid, and gave to the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethren thereof Leave and Licence every <HI>Mid∣summer</HI> to hold a Feast, and then to chuse them a Governour, or Master, with War∣dens. Whereupon, on the said day, in the Year 1300. they chose <HI>Henry de Rayl</HI> to be their Pilgrim, for the Master of this Mystery (as one that travel'd for the whole Company) was so called, until the Eleventh Year of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second; and the four Wardens, then called Purve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors of Alms, now known by the Name of Quar∣tridge, of the said Fraternity.</P>
<P>The stately Hall belonging to the Company of <HI>Merchant-Taylors,</HI> is scituate in <HI>Threadne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dle-street;</HI> sometimes the House of a Worshipful Gentleman, named <HI>Edmond Crepin,</HI> who in the Sixth of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, <HI>Anno</HI> 1331. for a certain Sum of Money, made his Grant thereof, by the Name of his Principal Messuage, to <HI>John Yakely,</HI> the King's Pavilion-maker, and was thereupon called <HI>New-Hall,</HI> or
<PB N="54" REF="31"/> <HI>Taylors-Inn:</HI> And in the 21. Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, Sir <HI>Thomas Holm,</HI> one of the Kings of Arms, granted by his Patent this Company for their Arms, <HI>(Viz.)</HI> In a Field of Silver, a Pavilion between two Royal Mantles, Purple gar∣nished with Gold, in a chief Azure, a Holy Lamb incircled with Rayes, the Crest upon the Helm, a Pavilion purple, garnished with Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As a further mark of Honour, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh favoured this Company, with condescending to be free of it; as many of his Predecessors the Kings of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> had been; <HI>(Viz.) Richard</HI> the Second, <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And for that divers of that Fraternity trading in Merchandise, abroad and at home, to the great enrich∣ing and advantage of the Kingdom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore did the said <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh (by his especial Grant) Incorporate them, by the Names of Masters and Wardens, <HI>Merchant-Taylors,</HI> of the Fraternity of St. <HI>John</HI> Baptist, in the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having spoken briefly of the Original Rise and Encrease of this worthy Company, I now proceed to tell of what more redounds to their Honour, <HI>(Viz.)</HI> They have in their Care and Protection a famous Grammar-School, known by the Name of <HI>Merchant-Taylors Free-School,</HI> founded by the Master and Wardens of that Company, <HI>Anno</HI> 1561. in <HI>Suffolk-lane,</HI> in the Parish of St. <HI>Lawrence Pount∣ney;</HI> and near to it, divers Alms-houses, in which are generally placed Seven de∣cayed Men of the Company, and their Wives, if they have any, and had at first the Allowance of Fourteen pence a week each, but since encreased to the Sum of Five pounds four shillings the Year, to each, pay'd Quarterly, besides Firing; and yet more to each of them Twenty shillings yearly; being the Gift of <HI>Walter Fish,</HI> sometime Master of the said Company.</P>
<P>At the West-End of <HI>Hog-street,</HI> by <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> they have divers fair Alms-houses, wherein live fourteen poor single Women, who receive better than Sixteen pence a week each, being pay'd weekly, beside Eight pound Fifteen shillings, pay'd yearly, out of the common Treasury, for the provision of Fewel. Nor has the boun∣teous Liberality of private Members of this Company, at any time been inferiour to the best; of which, that their Fame may live as a Pattern to others, to emulate or imitate, I shall particularize a few, <HI>(Viz.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>Robert Thorn,</HI> Merchant-Taylor, dying <HI>Anno</HI> 1532. bequeathed by his Testa∣ment, to sundry charitable uses, in Goods and Moneys, upward of the value of Four Thousand pounds; together with Five Thousand One Hundred and Forty pounds to his Relations; and yet proceeding to a Charity no less than the former, he over-and-above forgave his Debtors all they owed him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Whirt,</HI> who was Lord Mayor of the Honourable City of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1534. and a Brother of this Society, founded St. <HI>John</HI> Baptist College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> erected Schools at <HI>Bristol, Reading,</HI> and another College at <HI>Higham Fer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,</HI> and distributed several Thousands of pounds to other Charitable Vses.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Row,</HI> Knight, Lord Mayor of the honourable City of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1568. a Member of this Society, erected the new Church-Yard in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and gave an Hundred pounds to be sent to Eight poor men, without Vse; and Forty pounds a Year for ever, to maintain Ten poor Men, to be chosen out of five several Companys, <HI>(Viz.)</HI> Cloth-workers, Armourers, Tylers, Carpenters, and Plai∣sterers.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Offly,</HI> Merchant-Taylor, and Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who dyed <HI>Anno</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>80. appoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by his Testament, the one half of his Goods, and Two hundred
<PB N="55" REF="31"/> pound, to be deducted out of the other half, to be given to charitable Vses. And thus I might name many more, who have not only been Famous for Deeds of Cha∣rity and Conduct, in Magisterial Affairs, and encouraging Arts and Sciences, but for Loyalty, and valiant Vndertakings, for the service of their King and Country, have approved themselves not only Men, but such men, as have been an Ornament to the <HI>English</HI> Nation.</P>
<Q><L>Whose Names in Fame's Record shall ever stand,</L>
<L>Whilst Seas begirt our happy Fruitful Land;</L>
<L>And prove them such, as durst attempt to do</L>
<L>Whate'er their Prince or Fortune call'd 'em to;</L>
