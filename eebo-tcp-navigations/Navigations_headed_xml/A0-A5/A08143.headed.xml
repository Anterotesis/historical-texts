<HEAD>A PRODIGIOVS Eruption of Fire, which exhaled in the middest of the Ocean sea, over against the Isle of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> one of the <HI>Tercera's,</HI> and the new Island which it hath made. It tooke beginning the third of Iuly of this pre∣sent yeare 1638.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Etwixt the Tercera's Islands, so known to those who saile to the East and West Indies and to Brasile, there is a site of water in the midst of the sea, distant two leagues from the Island of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> which the adjoining in∣habitants call Ferraria, so abounding with fish, that it is doubtfull whether there bee any place more plentifull in all the seas. In this place nature hath wrought the most portentous case that the ages have seen, it was thus; On the third of the last Iuly,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> within the bottome of the sea, which in the sayd place is one hundred and fifty fadomes deepe, like the springing of a mine, with a horrible noyse and great horror, a space of earth separated it self, which would take the sowing of halfe a bushell of wheate, with the vehemencie and force of an impetuous fire, against which all the waters of the ocean sea it selfe could make no resistance, casting up to the clouds the water and earth in severed parts, as it were burning torches, and very great stones, some whereof ascending while others descended, and so encountring each other, returned by vertue of the new impulse to fly up more than three pikes high: others dissolved in pieces, did fly as if they had sai∣led large distances, and the broken pieces beeing handled, dissolved into blacke ashes, and all that cir∣cuit of water changing its nature, like withered and dry wood, ministreth matter if not aliment to the fire, which without ceasing doth continue burning. A fatall wonder, which is so much the more, to see that with the multitude of stones which the fire hath cast up, there is composed and formed a new Island, which takes up a league and a half in length, and is threescore fadomes high, and it did continue its augmentation and burning until the tenth day of the sayd Iuly, as appeareth by an assured relation which was sent to his Majesty, whom God protect, and is in the registry of State belonging to Portu∣gall. All the fish which were within more than eight leagues distance round about, died consumed,
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> and made worth nothing; and the sea cast forth up∣on the shores of the Island of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> so great a quantity, that it would have filled many of those ships which saile to the East Indies: and lest the aire should bee infected, they made great pits in which they buried them. All the sea boyled for many leagues, the smell of the brimstone was felt by the most remote of those Islands: the smoake and the ashes filled the aire, and hid the light of the Sunne, to the admiration of all the inhabitants of those Islands.</P>
<P>Before this fire there preceded an earthquake, which continued more than eight dayes, perceived in all those seas and Islands, and with a greater noise in that of Saint <HI>Michael;</HI> so that the inhabitants ter∣rified, confounded and astonished, lest they should perish amidst the ruines of the buildings, fled into the fields, where they remained for some days, con∣fessing, fasting, and making processions of bloud, and other acts of penance as those who feared to to die, either drowned with the Islands themselves, or consumed and burned with another equall fire.</P>
<P>Our Lord God was pleased that the wind should be from the land, for had it beene from sea, it had burned all the townes of the neighbouring Islands, and would have occasioned another cineration like that which hapned in those parts in the year 1630.</P>
<P>There went many persons to sound the depth of that place, and they have found that it hath of depth in the sea more than one hundred and fifty fadoms.

<HEAD>From <HI>Basill.</HI> A TRVE AND PARTICVLAR RELA∣tion, of the famous and bloudy bat∣taile, fought the 30 day of Iuly old stile, in this present yeare 1638. neare the Village of <HI>Wit∣ten-weyer</HI> in the County of <HI>Brisgaw</HI> on the River of Rhyne, how it was first begunne, and how it ended according to Gods good will and pleasure.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter that Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Saxō Weymar had kept his ge∣neral Randevouze the 27 of Iu∣ly, or 6 of Aug. at <HI>Langendenta∣lingen</HI> not farre from <HI>Fry-burg</HI> in the Countie of Brisgaw, and the next day therupō following directed his march towards <HI>Kentzingen,</HI> and pitched his Campe neare the said City. His Highnes recei∣ved intelligence by the parties, which he had sent abroad, that the Imperiall and Bavarian Armies with a great number of Wagons, laden with corne,
<PB N="12" REF="7"/> meale, and other victuals, were arrived neare the Cloister of Shutteren, his Highnes broke up again the same evening with his whole Army, &amp; marched the whole night, till unto the dawning of the day to meet them, and on Sunday morning being the 29 of Iuly or 8 of Aug: lighted upon both the Gene∣rall Field-marshals, the Duke of Savelly, and <HI>Iohn</HI> Count of Goetz with all their forces not far from the aforesaid Cloyster of Shutteren neare the Vil∣lage of Friesenheim, assaulted immediately their Sentinels consisting of commanded Horsemen, tooke prisoners a Lieutenant with eight horsemen, &amp; slew some more of thē, and the rest he pursued to the maine Imperiall Army and by the helpe of cer∣tain commāded troops of foot, cōsisting for the most part of French, took two passages, which the Impe∣riallists had strongly guarded, and slew there about 60 of the Imperial souldiers; wherefore the Impe∣rialists to hinder and to prevent a farther pursuite, thought it convenient &amp; good to fire the aforesaid Village in severall places; both the Field-marshals being certified of the unexpected comming of his Highnesse, Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Saxon Weymar and his suddaine assault, did beginne to march in good order with their whole Army and Artillery, upon an high and very advantageous hill hard by it, and to play from thence with their Canons upon his Highnesse Forces very fiercely and without cea∣sing, yet being their Canons plaid too high with∣out any great effect and harme; And that they were
<PB N="13" REF="7"/> answered by his Highnesse Canons divers times, although not so fiercely and so often, yet with more effect; in the meane time the Musquetiers skirmished one against another, insomuc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the same forenoone, on the Imperiall and B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>varian side, as they themselves confess'd above 120. men were slaine; but on his Highnesse side not ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 20. killed, and about 30 wounded. And although the French troopes, that were there, seeing they had so good successe in the beginning, were very eager to climbe up the Hill, and to assault the maine Imperi∣all Campe, yet his Highnesse had discry'd already, that without great danger and losse, nothing could be effected: and therefore found it more conveni∣ent in his judgement to betake himselfe into the open field hardby, &amp; to put his men into a right Bat∣taile-array, hoping that the abovesaid Generall Field-marshals, would likewise resolve to come downe upon his Highnesse; being prompted to it by a report and generall rumour of long continu∣ance that Field-marshall <HI>Goetz</HI> desired much to meet the Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> upon such tearmes.</P>
<P>His Ex. wished nothing else but the like occasion: But being both generalls were loth to breake forth out of their advantages in which they lay, and desi∣red not to medle further with his Highnes besides that which had passed with the Cannons and small skirmishes aforementioned, his Highnesse about noone retired somewhat towards Mohlburg, and thereby gave the more occasion to both generalls
<PB N="14" REF="8"/> Feild Marshalls to betake themselves likewise downe from the advantageous hill, upon which they lay. The night following was spent on both sides with alarum, and the next munday following being the 30 of Iuly, the 9 of August: his Highnesse caused the service of God and the sermon of the weeping of Christ over Ierusalem (which the day before by reason of those skirmishes was neglected) orderly to be performed: and whereas in the con∣clusion of the same sermon strong proofe was pro∣duced, how that God Almighty who is a God of long sufferance doth forbeare a long time the despi∣sers and persecutors of his holy word, and that al∣though they be terrible and mighty for a time, yet causeth them at last to bee confounded and over∣throwne: his Highnesse hereupon tooke finall re∣solution, and immediatly thereupon spoke these words to all the Cavalliers that were present, that without further delay he was resolved to fall upon the enemie, with a certaine assurance, that God Al∣mighty would grant them this day a glorious victorie, and immediatly thereupon gave order for the whole Armie to breake up, and assoone as his Highnesse had din'd, immediatly tooke horse, his Highnesse having received certaine intelligence, that both the general Feild-marishalls with all their forces, &amp; provisiō were already marching upwards towards the river of Rhine, and therefore his High∣nesse, least they should passe by and attaine to their end (the victualling of the City and Fort of Brys∣sack)
<PB N="15" REF="8"/> made the more haste to prevent them; and thereupon presently after 12 of the clock at noone near the Village of Wittenweyer (where his High∣nesse the last yeare had his sconce and Shipbridge) lighted upon the aforesaid Generalls, yet the said Generalls, having intelligence before of his comm∣ing, had made themselves ready in all things and therefore gotten the advantage of the ground to put their Army in battaile-aray, whereas on the other side it fell heavie and troblesome to his High∣nesse to march through a great wood and over a small Iland, moates and bridges, which were over∣grown with thick hedges, which by the help of cer∣taine 100 men of the Imperiall forces if not totally stopt, yet for a certaine time might much have hin∣dred him, but being his Highnesse found there no opposition, hee put his Artillery and the troopes, which he had got over there, at the end of the a∣foresaid wood into Battaglia, and kept them close together, till he had brought over all his forces and could give in a right order a full assault: whereupon the shooting with the Cannons was begun on both sides and continued with great eagernesse, inso∣much that his Highnesse right wing (which was lead by Generall Major <HI>Tupadell</HI>) because the Im∣periall and Bavarian right wing was selected and consisted of the choicest of their forces, as namely of the currassiers and others of the best Regiments, was beaten back a great way, and forced to retire as farre as the reserve, which was commanded by
<PB N="16" REF="9"/> Colonell <HI>Canofsky;</HI> and being the same stood yet somewhat farre behind, the Imperialists on their side stood in hope that they had got already a great victory, but that joy lasted not long, because as soone as the aforesaid Generall Major <HI>Tupadell</HI> had come within reach of the said Colonell <HI>Canofsky,</HI> they fell on againe withall possible speed upon the aforesaid left wing, and put the same so hard to it, that it did as Generall M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jor <HI>Tupadell</HI> afore was forced to do, to looke for a second.</P>
<P>In the meane time Colonell <HI>Rosal</HI> who toge∣ther with the Count of N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssaw and the Baron of Pulbus lead Duke <HI>Bernhards</HI> left wing, chased the Savellish and Goetzish right wing without any great resistance pell mell into their owne foote forces, and pursued so farre after them, that the Im∣periall party had great losse, and immediatly there∣upon a part of their foote Forces beganne to be∣take themselves to flight: In the meane time the rest of the Brigades came very nigh one upon ano∣ther, and yet the Imperiall Musquetiers would not give fire, till Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Weymar had drawne certaine small troopes out of his Army, and sent them close up to the Imperiall Musqueti∣ers and caused bullets to be changed one with ano∣ther, whereupon the maine body of the Army came one upon another, and now this party and then th'other party was assaulted by the horse men, and then seconded againe, in which mixture it came so farre, that at last they did beat the Musquets one
<PB N="17" REF="9"/> about another heads, and the Goetzish attained of Duke <HI>Bernhards</HI> Artilery 3. peeces shooting a bul∣led of 12. pound, and foure small field peeces: On the other side Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Weymar got into his power all the Imperiall and Bavarian Canons, together with all the Bullets and appurtenances, whereupon both sides made use of his enemies Ca∣nons, as much as they would, yet with this remark∣able inequallty, that the <HI>Goetzish</HI> being they were not provided with fitting bullets for those 7 peeces of Ordnance which they had obtained, had but small advantage by them, but the Weymarish con∣tinually and with a remarkable effect could shoote: Now being it lasted so long, so that those that be∣longed to the Artillery were quite tired, a part of Duke <HI>Bernhards</HI> horsemen alighted, and supplyed the office of the tired Constables or Gunners and carryed away the praise, that they have shot extra∣ordinary well: Yet notwithstanding being the Im∣periallists had still fresh supply of more Forces, which consisted of old beaten and expert Souldi∣ers, and found in the Weymarish the like, they fought so stoutly on both sides that not one Squ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣drō, except it was drawn off by force, did leave the field, but did fight so valiantly one with another, that each side for the second time got his enemies ground, in somuch that the victory was doubtfull for five houres together, at last they fought onely by way of Squadrons and Regiments one against another, whereof each of them would not leave
<PB N="18" REF="10"/> the field, till it was beaten out of it by maine force, till at last the Goetzish and Savellish betooke them∣selves to flight by whole troops, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell one upon anothers baggage, and begun themselves to pillage their owne; but the Weymarish followed them close, and chased them away from it, and parted the good booty amongst themselves, and by that meanes divi∣ded and seperated themselves so farre one from ano∣ther, that Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Weymar could no more relye upon his horsemen, but onely with the foot for∣ces, and some few troopes of horse maintained the place of fight, and in that place his Highnesse was well and thankfully contented with this and other vi∣ctories, which it had pleased God Almighty to grant unto him.</P>
<P>Now when it was come so farre, that many of the Commanders wished much joy to his Highnesse of that glorious victory, Generall Major <HI>Tupadell</HI> was urged by his zeale and eagernesse to pursue with some small troops of his men after the fugitives; and when he had sent his troops up and downe, here and there, and thought to returne backe againe with some few men thinking that no more of the Imperiall and Ba∣varian troops were at hand: he was met unawares by an Imperiall troop, which had drawn together a∣gaine, and thus was carried away prisoner: and neere the very place of fight, five Imperiall squadrons of horse, and foure of foot, lay yet on a certaine hill, and a very advantagious place, which made shew, as if they would defend themselves further; but as soone
<PB N="19" REF="10"/> as the maine body of the Wey-marish Army came neere unto them, and a blinde alarum was made, they retired immediatly in a great disorder, and fled to∣wards Offenburg, where his Excellence Field-mar∣shall <HI>Goetz</HI> himselfe stayed not above halfe an houre, but with sixe wagons loaden with baggage, which of all the rest he had left behinde him there, retired yet the same night, together with General Major <HI>Sknetter,</HI> Colonell <HI>Geyling, Truekmuller,</HI> and <HI>Reynach</HI> towards <HI>Overkerk,</HI> into the narrow valley, where his Excel∣lency caused divers high Officers which were carried away from the place of fight either dead, or dyed by the way, to be buried: In the meane time the wayes and passages over the high mountaines, (called the <HI>Kniebis</HI>) which were stopped by cutting downe of trees, he caused by the Country people to be opened, and the rest of his and the Duke of <HI>Savellies</HI> troopes, as namely 1400 horse. and 900 foot, yet all in a great confusion, to march through the said passages into the Country of Wirtenberg, and immediately thereupon caused the said wayes and passages to be digged up a∣gaine, and to be stopped with cutting downe of trees, more then they were afore-time. On the other side, his Highnesse Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Weymar took his lodging upon the place of fight amongst the dead and wounded, where the enemy in the beginning stood in battell aray, and there rested with joy of his extraor∣dinary great labour, which he had that day, because he himselfe in person hath brought up and lead on almost all the Squadrons and Brigads, and many
<PB N="20" REF="11"/> times he was in the midst of the enemies troops, and was knowne by many of the Imperiall Officers, which called him by his name, and craved quarter of him: but God Almighty hath protected his Highnesse so farre, that he had not the least hurt, onely upon his armour he had got two slashes. His Highnesse motto in this hot and bloudy battell was, <HI>Gott mitt vus:</HI> or in English, <HI>God with us:</HI> and amongst the French and other nations then present in the battell, which could not well pronounce the German language, their mot∣to was <HI>Emanuel.</HI> But amongst the Goetzish and Savel∣lish, they called <HI>Ferdinandus:</HI> the victory consisted in these points. 1 That his Highnesse Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> of Saxon Weymar recovered againe not onely all his Canons, which the Imperialists during the battell had taken from him, but also taken from them all theirs, as many as they had about them; namely, two Demi-Cannons, two great heavy pieces, which they call Boehlers, wherof each did shoot 125 l. bullet, three Faulcons, two Falconets, and foure Field-pieces, to∣gether with all their appurtenances, Bullets, Grana∣does, Gunne-powder and Matches, which consisted of a great quantity; as also many wagons loaden with all manner of materials two Field-Smiths, and all ne∣cessaries belonging to the state of a well ordered Artil∣lery, together with all the Officers and men belong∣ing thereunto. 2 That his Highnesse hath obtained all the victuals and provision wherewith the City and Fort of Brysack should have beene relieved together with all the wagons that belonged thereunto, which
<PB N="21" REF="11"/> were in all 1000 in number. 3 That his Highnesse hath taken from the Goetzish and Savellish, all their baggage, namely 2000 Wagons and Carts, amongst which were many faire Coaches, with a very rich booty, and especially the Chaunceries and letters of both the Generall Field-Marshals. 4 That his High∣nesse hath taken from them 80 Standards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd En∣signes, amongst which were 7 of Generall Field-Mar∣shall <HI>Goetz,</HI> his Life Regiment of Currassiers, which are very faire, and embroydered with silver and gold, and of other Regiments of Currassiers, were likewise found divers standards. 5 That not onely above 1500 men of the Imperiall and Bavarian Army were slaine upon the place of fight, but also a great number of them chased into the River of Rhine and drowned: many yeelded upon discretion, and tooke service un∣der Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Weymar: many were taken prisoners; and in a word, this brave Army, which consisted altogether of the ancient Regiments, at least 12000 effective strong, was so diminished and disper∣sed, that as above said, not above 2500 men of horse and foot, came againe to their Generals, but how ma∣ny wounded and hurt men are amongst them, is not yet knowne. The Imperiall Field-Marshall, <HI>Duc de Savelly,</HI> was shot into his backe, and narrowly esca∣ped. Colonell <HI>Seneschall</HI> is taken prisoner, Colonell <HI>Meusell,</HI> Colonell <HI>Hagshausen,</HI> Colonell <HI>Sales,</HI> who commanded the Brisigellish: Colonell <HI>Stephan Al∣bert,</HI> who commanded the Tyllish: and Colonell <HI>de Puis,</HI> who commanded the Eppish Regiment, as also
<PB N="22" REF="12"/> Colonell <HI>Limpach,</HI> and as it is generally beleeved, Colonell <HI>Edelstett</HI> are slaine: five Lievetenant Colo∣nels are taken prisoners, and at least sixe or seven slaine. Of Sergeant Majors were but three taken pri∣soners, but how many of them (as also of Captaines of horse, Captaines of foot, Lievetenants, Standard∣bearers, Ancients, and other under Officers) were slaine, it is not yet perfectly knowne, although a great number of them are known, and easily may be gues∣sed at by the precedent relation. Sergeant Major <HI>Vi∣vario</HI> was buried at Overkerk, besides other officers: and it is certaine that a great number of the Imperiall Officers are taken prisoners, even the Rosich Regi∣ment alone hath taken above 100. amongst which the meanest are quarter-masters; but the reason why the whole number of all the Regiments could not be drawn together and here named, is, because the Regi∣ments cōtinued together no lōger, but one whole day, but were partly by his Highnesse, D. <HI>Bernard</HI> of Wey∣mar commanded to pursue further after the enemy, and the most part of them sent here and there into their quarters for the better conveniency of getting sorrage for the horses. His Highnesse Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> of Weymar in this great and violent re-encounter, hath lost on his side fourteene Ensignes, and eight Standards, two Majors, as namely Major <HI>Weyersheim</HI> of the Tupadellish Regiment of horse, and Major <HI>Vitzthumb</HI> of the Hatsteinish Regiment of foot, toge∣ther with eight or nine Captaines of horse and foot, and certaine under Officers, as also about 500 com∣mon

By all mens judgement Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> by his owne strength could not have bin able to beat the enemy againe out of the Sconces which they had taken; and therefore his Highnesse and all the Colonells give the praise, next unto God, to the French, which fought like Lions, and gave quarter to none, but onely to seven or eight Captaines: Our high-Dutch have spared the lives of many Officers. Three chiefe Commanders whose names are not yet knowne, are slaine. Last night we thought the Enemy would have againe assaulted our Campe, but he departed suddenly in the night, and tooke his way toward Freybury, forsaking the other Sconce which he had yesterday in his possession. Our Horsemen are this day to follow him. Wee hope now to be shortly masters of Brissack.
