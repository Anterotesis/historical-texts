round like a ring, as hee did like a globe, it might haue beene
most worthily the onely gemme therein. For the ayre is most

may say nothing of healthfull Bathes, and of Meares stored
both with fish and fowle; The earth fertile of all kinde of
graine, manured with good husbandrie, rich in minerall of

beautified with many populous Citties, faire Borroughs, good

Pallaces of the Prince, stately houses of the Nobilitie, fre∣quent
Hospitals, beautiful Churches, faire Colleges, as well in
other places, as in the two Vniversities, which are comparable
to all the rest in Christendome, not onely in antiquitie, but also
in learning, building, and endowments. As for governement
Ecclesiasticall and Civill, which is the very soule of a king∣dome,
I neede to say nothing, whenas I write to home-borne,

<P><HI>But to praise</HI> Britaine <HI>according as the dignitie thereof re∣quireth

<P><HI>Adde heerevnto (if you please) these few lines out of a farre

O happy <HI>Britaine</HI> and more blisfull then all other Regions: Nature
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
hath enriched thee with all commodities of heaven and earth,
wherein there is neither extreame colde in Winter, nor scorch∣ing
heate in Summer; wherein there is such aboundant plenty
of Corne, as may suffice both for Bread and Wine: wherein are
Woodes without wilde Beasts, and the Fields without noysome

with an assured confidence, wee hope it will likewise bee

MERCIE and TRVTH, RIGHTEOVSNES and PEACE may

kingdomes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> hitherto severed, are
now conioyned, and beginne to close together into one, in
their most antient name of BRITAINE.</P>
<P>If any would vndertake the honour and precedence of
<HI>Britaine</HI> before other Realmes in serious maner (for heere
I protest once for all, I will passe over each thing lightly &amp;
slightly) a world of matter at the first view would present
it selfe vnto him. As that the true Christian Religion was

was accounted a special note of maiesty in former ages, the
Kings of <HI>England,</HI> with them of <HI>Fraunce, Ierusalem, Naples,</HI>
and afterward <HI>Scotland,</HI> were antiently the onely annointed
Kings of Christendome: which manner beganne among

<P>As for that admirable gift hereditary to the annoynted

you to the learned Discourse thereof lately written. Ney∣ther
would it be forgotten, that <HI>England</HI> in the opinion of
the Popes (when they swayd the world, and their authori∣tie
was held sacred) was preferred, because it contained in
the Ecclesiasticall Division, two large Provinces, which
had their severall <HI>Legatinati,</HI> whereas <HI>Fraunce</HI> had scantly

matter of honour, when all Christianitie in the Counsell
<HI>Constance</HI> was divided into Nations, <HI>Anglicana Natio</HI> was
one of the principall and no sub alterne. As also, that in times
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
past, the Emperour was accounted <HI>Maior filius Ecclesiae,</HI> the
King of <HI>France, Filius Minor,</HI> and the King of <HI>England, Fi∣lius
Tertius,</HI> and <HI>Adoptivus.</HI> And so in generall Councells,
as the King of <HI>Fraunce</HI> had place next the Emperour on
the right hand, so the King of <HI>England</HI> on the left; and the
Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as appeereth in an antient Roman Pro∣vinciall,

Pontifices Maximi,</HI> and they had their place in all general
Councells, at the Popes right foote. The Title also of <HI>De∣fensor
fidei,</HI> is as honourable, and more iustly conferred vp∣on
the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> than, either <HI>Christianissimus</HI> vpon
the French, or <HI>Catholicus</HI> vpon the Spaniard. Neither is it
to be omitted, which is so often recorded in our Histories,
when <HI>Brithwald</HI> the Monke, not long before the Conquest
busied his brain much about the succession of the Crown,
because the blood Royall was almost extinguished, he had
a strange vision, and heard a voyce, which forbade him to
be inquisitive of such matters, resounding in his eares. <HI>The

were farther North, and after as is most probable, called
<HI>Pictes,</HI> (for that they still painted themselues when the Sou∣therne

couragiously defended their libertie, but offended the Ro∣mans
with continuall and most dangerous incursions. The

great honour abroad. For the French cannot but ac∣knowledge
they have seldome atchieved any honourable
acts without Scottish hands, who therefore are deservedly
to participate the glorie with them. As also divers parts of
<HI>France, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Suitzerland,</HI> cannot but confesse, that
they owe to the Scottish Nation, the propagation of good
letters and Christian religion amongst them.</P>
<P>After the Scottishmen, the Angles, Englishmen or Sax∣ons,
by Gods wonderfull providence were transplanted hi∣ther

<P>This warlike, victorious, stiffe, stowt, and rigorous Na∣tion,
after it had as it were taken roote heere about one hun∣dred

Christ, and our ingrafting into his mysticall bodie by holy
baptisme. Which <HI>Beda</HI> our Ecclesiastical Historian recoun∣teth
in this manner, and I hope you will give it the reading.
<HI>Gregorie</HI> the Great Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> on a time saw beautifull

<P>Since which time, they made such happy progresse in
the Christian profession both of faith and works, that if I
should but enter into consideration thereof, I should be
over-whelmed with mayn tides of matter. Many and ad∣mirable
monuments thereof, do every where, at home pre∣sent

no small number in our age, although few men note them,)
not for affectation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, or ostentation of wealth, but to
the glorie of God, increase of faith, of learning and to main∣tenance
of the poore. As for abroad, the world ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> testifie

<P>Great verily was the glory of our tongue before the <HI>Nor∣man</HI>
Conquest in this, that the olde <HI>English</HI> could expresse
most aptly, all the conceiptes of the minde in their owne
tongue without borrowing from any. As for example:</P>
<P>The holy service of God, which the <HI>Latines</HI> called <HI>Religi∣on,</HI>
because it knitted the mindes of men together, and most
people of <HI>Europe</HI> have borrowed the same from them, they
called most significantly <HI>Fan-fastnes,</HI> as the one and onely
assurance and fast anker-holde of our soules health.</P>
<P>The gladsome tidings of our salvation, which the <HI>Greekes</HI>
called <HI>Evangelion,</HI> and other Nations in the same word, they
called <HI>Godspel,</HI> that is, <HI>God speech.</HI></P>
<P>For our <HI>Saviour,</HI> which wee borrowed from the <HI>French,</HI>
and they from the <HI>Latin Salvator,</HI> they called in their owne
word, <HI>Haelend</HI> from <HI>Hael,</HI> that is, <HI>Salus,</HI> safetie, which we
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tame still in <HI>Al-hael,</HI> and <HI>Was-hael,</HI> that is, <HI>Ave, Salve, Sis
salvus.</HI></P>
<P>They could call the disciples of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leorning</NOTE> <HI>Leorning Cnibtas,</HI>
that is, <HI>Learning Servitours.</HI> For <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> which is now a name
of worship, signified with them an <HI>Attendant,</HI> or servitour.</P>
<P>They could name the <HI>Pharises</HI> according to the <HI>Hebrew,
Sunder-halgens,</HI> as holy religious men which had sundred
and severed themselves from other.</P>
<P>The Scribes they could call in their proper significati∣on,
as <HI>Booke-men, Bocer.</HI> So they called parchment which
wee have catcht from the Latine <HI>Pergamenum, Boc-fell</HI> in
respect of the vse.</P>
<P>So they could call the sacrament <HI>Haligdome,</HI> as holy
iudgement. For so it is according as we receive it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="14"/>
They could call <HI>Fortilitie</HI> and fruitfulnesse of land sig∣nificatively
<HI>Eordes-wela,</HI> as wealth of the earth.</P>
<P>They could call a <HI>Comet,</HI> a <HI>Faxed starre;</HI> which is all one
with <HI>Stella Crinita,</HI> or <HI>Cometa.</HI> So they did call the iudge∣ment
seate <HI>Domesettle.</HI></P>
<P>That which we call the <HI>Parlament</HI> of the <HI>French Parier</HI>
to speake, they called a <HI>Witten mot,</HI> as the meeting and as∣sembly
of wise men.</P>
<P>The certaine and inward knowledge of that which is
in our minde, be it good or bad, which in the Latine word
we call <HI>Conscience,</HI> they called <HI>Inwit,</HI> as that which they
did inwardly wit and wote, that is, know certainely.</P>
<P>That in a river which the Latines call <HI>Alveus,</HI> and <HI>Cana∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is,</HI>
and from thence most nations of <HI>Europe</HI> name the <HI>Cha∣nel,
Kanel, Canale, &amp;c.</HI> they properly called the <HI>Streame∣race.</HI></P>
<P>Neither in the degrees of kinred they were destitute of
significative woordes; for he whom we of a <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>En∣glish</HI>
compound word call <HI>Grandfather,</HI> they called <HI>Eald-fa∣der,</HI>
whom we call <HI>Great Grandfather,</HI> they called <HI>Thirda∣fader.</HI>
So <HI>Proavus,</HI> which we call <HI>Great Great Grandfather,</HI>
they called <HI>Fortha-fader,</HI> as <HI>Abavus, Fiftha-fader.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Eunuch,</HI> for whome we have no name, but from the
<HI>Greekes,</HI> they could aptly name <HI>Vnstana,</HI> that is, without
stones, as we vse <HI>Vnspotted</HI> for without spotte, <HI>Vnlearned,</HI> for,
without learning.</P>
<P>A Covetous man whome we so call of the <HI>French Con∣voitise,</HI>
they truely called <HI>Git-sor,</HI> as a fore &amp; eagre <HI>Getter,</HI> and
<HI>Gatherer.</HI></P>
<P>That which the Latines call <HI>Abortus,</HI> and wee in many
wordes, <HI>Vntimely Birth,</HI> or, <HI>Borne before the full time,</HI> they
called <HI>Miss-borne.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Porter,</HI> which wee have received from the <HI>French,</HI>
they could in their own word as significatively call <HI>A Dore∣ward.</HI></P>
<P>I could particulate in many more, but this woulde ap∣peare
most plentifully, if the labours of the learned Gen∣tlemen
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
Maister <HI>Laurence Nowell</HI> of <HI>Lincolnes Inne,</HI> who first
in our time recalled the studie heereof, Maister <HI>William
Lambert,</HI> Maister <HI>I: Ioscelin,</HI> Maister <HI>Fr: Tate</HI> were once
published. Otherwise it is to bee feared, that devouring
<HI>Time,</HI> in few yeeres will vtterly swallow it, without hope
of recoverie.</P>
<P>The alteration and innovation in our tongue as in all o∣thers,
hath beene brought in by entrance of Strangers, as
<HI>Danes, Normans,</HI> and others which have swarmed hither, by
trafficke, for new words as well as for new wares, have al∣waies
come in by the tyranne <HI>Time,</HI> which altereth all vn∣der
heaven, by <HI>Vse,</HI> which swayeth most, and hath an abso∣lute
command in words, and by <HI>Pregnant wits:</HI> specially since
that learning after long banishment, was recalled in the
time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, it hath beene beautified and
enriched out of other good tongues, partly by enfranchi∣sing
and endenizing strange words, partly by refining and
mollifying olde words, partly by implanting new wordes
with artificiall composition, happily containing themselves
within the bounds prescribed by <HI>Horace.</HI> So that our long
is (and I doubt not but hath beene) as copious, pithie, and
significative, as any other tongue in <HI>Europe:</HI> and I hope we
are not yet and shall not heereafter come to that which <HI>Se∣neca</HI>
saw in his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Epistolis.</NOTE> <HI>When mens mindes beginne once to iniure
themselves to dislike whatsoever is vsuall, is disdained. They af∣fect
noveltie in speech, they recall forworne and vncuth words,
they forge new phrases, and that which is newest, is best liked;
there is presumptuous and farre fetching of words. And some
there are which thinke it a grace if their speech doe hover,
and thereby hold the hearer in suspence:</HI> you know what fol∣loweth.</P>
<P>Omitting this, pardon me and thinke me not overbal∣lanced
with affection, if I thinke that our <HI>English</HI> tongue
is (I will not say as sacred as the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> or as learned as the
<HI>Greeke,</HI>) but as fluent as the <HI>Latine,</HI> as courteous as the <HI>Spa∣nish,</HI>
as courtlike as the <HI>French,</HI> and as amorous as the <HI>Italian,</HI>
as some Italianated amorous have confessed. Neither hath
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
any thing detracted more from the dignitie of our tongue,
than our owne affection of forraine tongues, by admiring,
praising, and studying them above measure: whereas the
wise <HI>Romans</HI> thought no small part of their honour to con∣sist
in the honour of their language, esteeming it a disho∣nour
to answer any forraine in his owne language. As for
a long time the English placed in the Borrough townes of
<HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> would admit neither Irish nor Welsh a∣mong
them. And not long since for the honour of our na∣tive
tongue, <HI>Henry Fitz-Allan</HI> Earle of <HI>Arundell,</HI> in his tra∣vaile
into <HI>Italie,</HI> and the Lord <HI>William Howard</HI> of <HI>Effing∣ham,</HI>
in his government of <HI>Calice,</HI> albeit they were not igno∣rant
of other forraine tongues, would answer no strangers
by word or writing, but onely in English. As in this consi∣deration
also before them Cardinall <HI>Wolsey</HI> in his ambas∣sage
into <HI>France,</HI> commaunded all his servaunts to vse no
French, but meere English to the French, in all communica∣tion
whatsoever.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Monosyllables</HI> so rife in our tongue which were
not so originally, although they are vnfitting for verses and
measures, yet are they most fit for expressing briefly the first
conceipts of the minde, or <HI>Intentionalia</HI> as they call them in
schooles: so that we can set downe more matter in fewer
lines, than any other language. Neither do we or the Welsh
so curtall <HI>Latine,</HI> that we make all therein <HI>Monosyllables,</HI> as
<HI>Ioseph Scaliger</HI> chargeth vs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Catalecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> who in the meane time forget∣teth
that his Frenchmen have put in their <HI>Proviso</HI> in the e∣dict
of <HI>Pacification</HI> in the <HI>Grammaticall</HI> warre, that they
might not pronounce <HI>Latine</HI> distinctly, as the English com∣mon
Lawyers obtained then a <HI>Reservation</HI> that they might
write false <HI>Latine,</HI> and the Irish not to observe quantitie of
syllables. I cannot yet but confesse that we have corruptly
contracted most names both of men and places, if they were
of more then two sillables, and thereby hath ensued no lit∣tle
obscuritie.</P>
<P>Whereas our tongue is mixed, it is no disgrace, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as
all the tongues of <HI>Europe</HI> doe participate interchangeably
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>
the one of the other, and in the learned tongues, there hath
been like borrowing one from another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Mithridat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Yet is it false which
<HI>Gesner</HI> affirmeth, that our tongue is the most mixt and cor∣rupt
of all other. For if it may please any to compare but the
Lords Prayer in other languages, he shall finde as few <HI>La∣tine</HI>
and borrowed forraine words in ours, as in any other
whatsoever. Notwithstanding the diversiue of Nations
which have swarmed hither, and the practise of the Nor∣mans,
who as a monument of their Conquest, would have
yoaked the English vnder their tongue, as they did vnder
their command, by compelling them to teach their children
in schooles nothing but French, by setting downe their
lawes in the Norman-French, and enforcing them most ri∣gorously
to pleade and to be impleaded in that tongue one∣ly,
for the space of three hundred yeares, vntill K. <HI>Edward</HI>
the third enlarged them first from that bondage. Since which
time, our language hath risen by little, and the proverbe pro∣ved
vntrue, which so long had beene vsed, <HI>Iacke would be a
gentleman, if he could speake any French.</HI></P>
<P>Heerein is a notable argument of our Ancestors sted∣fastnes
in esteeming and retaining their owne tongue. For
as before the Conquest they misliked nothing more in K.
<HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, than that he was Frenchified, &amp; ac∣counted
the desire of forraine language, then to be a fore∣token
of the bringing in of forraine powers, which indeede
happened. In like manner after the Conquest, notwithstan∣ding
those enforcements of the Normans in supplanting it,
and the nature of men, which is most pliable with a curious
iolitie to fashion &amp; frame themselves according to the man∣ners,
attyre, and language of the Conquerours. Yet in all
that long space of 300. yeares, they intermingled very few
French-Norman words, except some termes of law, hun∣ting,
hawking, and dicing, whenas wee within these 60.
yeares, have incorporated so many Latine and French, as
the third part of our tongue consisteth now in them. But
like themselves, continue still those old Englishmen which
were planted in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in <HI>Fingall,</HI> &amp; the Country of <HI>Weys∣ford,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
in the time of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the second, who yet still conti∣nue
their antient attyre and tongue, in somuch that an En∣glish
gentleman not long since, sent thither in Commssion
among them, said that he would quickly vnderstand the
Irish, when they spake the antient English. So that our An∣cestors
seemed in part as iealous of their native language, as
those <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itans</HI> which passed hence into <HI>Armorica</HI> in <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius.</NOTE>
and marrying strange women there, did cut out their tongs,
lest their children should corrupt their language with their
motters tongues, or as the <HI>Germans</HI> which have most of all
Nations opposed themselves against all innovations in ha∣bite,
and language.</P>
<P>Whereas the <HI>Hebrew Rabbines</HI> say, and that truly, that
Nature hath given man five instruments for the pronoun∣cing
of all letters, the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the palate,
and throate; I will not denie but some among vs do pro∣nounce
more fully, some flatly, some broadly, and no few
mincingly, offending in defect, excesse, or change of letters,
which is rather to be imputed to the persons and their edu∣cation,
than to the language. Whenas generally wee pro∣nounce
by the confession of strangers, as sweetely, smooth∣ly,
and moderately, as any of the Northerne Nations of the
world, who are noted to soupe their words out of the throat
with fat and full spirits.</P>
<P>This variety of pronuntiation hath brought in some di∣versitie
of Orthographie, and heere-vpon Sir <HI>Iohn Price,</HI> to
the derogation of our tongue, and glorie of his <HI>Welsh,</HI> re∣porteth
that a sentence spoken by him in <HI>English,</HI> &amp; penned
out of his mouth by foure good Secretaries, severally, for tri∣al
of our Orthography, was so set downe by them, that they
all differed one from the other in many letters: whereas so
many <HI>Welsh</HI> writing the same likewise in their tongue vari∣ed
not in any one letter at all. Well, I will not derogate from
the good Knights credite; yet it hath beene seene where
tenne English writing the same sentence, have all so con∣curred,
that among them all there hath beene no other
difference, than the adding, or omitting once or twice of
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>
our silent <HI>E,</HI> in the end of some wordes. As for the <HI>Welsh,</HI>
I could never happen on two of that Nation together, that
would acknowledge that they could write their owne lan∣guage.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> her Maiesties secretarie not long since,
a man of great learning and iudgement, occasioned by som
vncertainty of our Orthographie, though it seeme groun∣ded
vpon <HI>Sound, Reason,</HI> and <HI>Custome,</HI> laboured to reduce
it to certaine heads; Seeing that whereas of Necessity there
must be so many letters in every tongue, as there are sim∣ple
and single sounds, that the Latine letters were not suf∣ficient
to expresse all our simple sounds. Therefore he wi∣shed
that we should have A short, and A long, bicause <HI>a</HI> in
<HI>Man,</HI> and in <HI>Mân</HI> of horse hath different sounds; E long as
in <HI>Mên</HI> moderate, and <HI>e</HI> short as in <HI>Men,</HI> and an English <HI>e</HI>
as in <HI>wée, thee, he, me:</HI> I long, and I short, as in Bi, <HI>per,</HI>
and Bî, <HI>emere:</HI> O short, and O long, as in smōk of a wo∣man,
and smôk of the fire: V long, as in Bût, <HI>Ocrea,</HI> and
V short, as in Būt, <HI>Sed:</HI> and v or y <HI>Greeke,</HI> as slu, nu, tru.
For consonants he would have C be never vsed but for Ch,
as it was among the olde English, and K in all other words;
for Th, he would have the <HI>Saxon</HI> letter <HI>Thorne,</HI> which was
a D with a dash through the head, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for I consonant the
<HI>Saxon</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et,</HI> not Ieat for Ieat-stone, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay</HI> for Iay:
<HI>Q,</HI> if he were king of the A, B, C, should be putte to the
horne, and banished; and <HI>Ku</HI> in his place, as <HI>Kuik,</HI> not
<HI>quik, Kuarel,</HI> not <HI>Quarel: Z;</HI> he would have vsed for the
softer <HI>S,</HI> or eth, and es, as <HI>dîz</HI> for dieth, <HI>liz</HI> for lies, and
the same <HI>S</HI> inverted for <HI>sh,</HI> as <HI>Sal</HI> for <HI>shall, fler</HI> for <HI>flesh.</HI>
This briefly I have set you downe his devise, which albeit
<HI>Sound</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> seemed to countenance, yet that Tyranne
<HI>Custome</HI> hath so confronted, that it will never be admit∣ted.</P>
<P>If it be any glorie which the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> do brag
of, that many wordes in their tongues doe not differ from
the <HI>Greeke,</HI> I can shew you as many in the <HI>English;</HI> where∣of
I will give you a few for a taste, as they have offred them∣selves

in reading; but withall, I trust you will not gather
by consequence, that wee are descanded from the <HI>Graeci∣ans.</HI>

<P>This merry playing with words too much vsed by some
hath occasioned a great and high personage, to say, that as
the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue is fit for courting, the <HI>Spanish</HI> for treating,
the <HI>French</HI> for trafficke; so the <HI>English</HI> is most fit for trifling

whenas in his time he saith, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Welsh</HI> delighted
much in licking the letter and clapping together of Ag∣nominations.
But now will I conclude this trifling discourse
with a true tale out of an antient Historian.</P>
<P>Of the effectuall power of words, great disputes have
beene of great wits in all ages; the <HI>Pithagoreans</HI> extolled it,
the impious Iewes ascribed all miracles to a name which
was ingravened in the revestiarie of the Temple, watched
by two brazen dogges, which one stale away and enseamed
it in his thigh, as you may reade in <HI>Osorius de Sapientia,</HI> and
the like in <HI>Rabi Hamas Speculation:</HI> and strange it is what
<HI>Samonicus Serenus</HI> ascribed to the word ABRADACABRA, a∣gainst
agues. But there was one true English word of as
great, if not greater force than them all, now out of all vse
and will be thought for sound barbarous; but therefore of
more efficacie (as it pleaseth <HI>Porphyrie</HI>) and in signification
it signifieth as it seemeth, no more then abiect, base minded,
false harted, coward, or nidget. Yet it hath levied Armies,
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>
and subdued rebellious enemies; and that I may hold you
no longer, it is <HI>Niding.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">William Malms∣bury.</NOTE> For when there was a daungerous
rebellion against King <HI>William Rufus,</HI> and <HI>Rochester</HI> Ca∣stle
then the most important &amp; strongest fort of this Realm
was stowtly kept against him, after that he had but proclai∣med
that his subiects should repaire thither to his Campe,
vpon no other penaltie, but that whosoever refused to come,
should be reputed a <HI>Niding:</HI> they swarmed to him immedi∣atly
from all sides in such numbers, that he had in few daies
an infinite Armie, and the rebells therewith weere so terri∣fied,
that they forthwith yeelded. While I runne on in this
course of English tongue, rather respecting matter then
words, I forget that I may be charged by the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion refi∣ners
of English, neither to write State-English, Court-En∣glish,
nor Secretarie-English, and verily I acknowledge it.
Sufficient it is for me, if I have waded hither-vnto in the
fourth kinde, which is plaine English, leaving to such as are
compleat in all, to supply whatsoever remaineth.</P>

<P>The most antient Nation of the Iewes gave the name
at the Circumcision the eight day after the nativitie; the
Romans to females the same day, to males the ninth day,
which they called <HI>Dies lustricus,</HI> as it were the cleansing day;
vpon which day they solemnized a feast called <HI>Nominalia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Anima ca. 19.</NOTE>

as I conceive, their nativitie was set. At what time other
Nations in auntient times gave names I have not read:
but since Christianitie, most Nations for the time followed
the Iewes, celebrating baptisme the eight day after the birth,
onely our Ancestours in this Realme, vntill latter time bap∣tized,
and gave name the very birth day, or next day after,
following therein the counsell of S. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> in his third E∣pistle

these Ladies was very beautifull called <HI>Vrraca,</HI> the other
not so beautifull, but named <HI>Blanche.</HI> When they were pre∣sented
to the Ambassadours, all men held it as a matter re∣solved
that the choyce would light vpon <HI>Vrraca,</HI> as the elder

names, tooke offence at <HI>Ʋrraca,</HI> and made choyce of the

in <HI>France</HI> than the other, as signifying faire and beau∣tifull,
according to the verse made to her honour.</P>
<L>Candida, candescens candore, &amp; cordis, &amp; oris.</L>
<P>So that the greatest Philosopher <HI>Plato</HI> might seeme, not
without cause, to advise men to be carefull in giving faire

actions, and successes of men to be according to their <HI>Fate,

<P>In times of Christianity the names of most holy and ver∣tuous

<HI>Iosias, &amp;c.</HI> as better agreeing with our saith, but without
contempt of our countrey names (as I hope) which have
both good and gratious significations, as shal appeare here∣after.</P>
<P>Whereas in late yeeres Surnames have beene given for
Christian names, among vs, and no where else in Christen∣dome;
although many dislike it, for that great inconveni∣ence
will ensue: neverthelesse it seemeth to proceede from
hearty good-will and affection of the Godfathers to show
their love, or from a desire to continue and propagate their
owne names to succeeding ages. And is in no wise to be dis∣liked,
but rather approoved in those which matching with
heires generall of worshipful antient families have given
those names to their heires, with a mindefull and thankefull
regard of them, as we have now, <HI>Pickering Wott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Grevill

of the name, we see that the selfe name, yea &amp; som∣time
the similitude of names doth kindle sparkles of love
and liking among meere strangers.</P>
<P>Neither can I beleeve a waiward olde man, which would
say, that the giving of Surnames for Christian names first
began in the time of king <HI>Edward</HI> the sixt, by such as would
be Godfathers, when they were more then halfe fathers,
and thereupon would have perswaded some to change such
names at the Confirmation. Which (that I may note by
the way) is vsuall in other countries, as wee remember two
sonnes of king <HI>Henry</HI> the second of <HI>France,</HI> christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by the

<P>Our Nation was farre from those and such curious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
therefore heere will I overpasse them, and set downe <HI>Alph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣betically</HI>
the names which wee now call Christian names,
most vsuall to the English Nation, with their significations.
For this is to be takē as a granted veritie, that names among
all nations and tongues (as I partly noted before) as signi∣ficative
and not vaine senselesse sounds. Among the <HI>Ho∣brew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>

<P>So that it were grosse ignorance and to no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall reproach,
of our Progenitours, to thinke their names onely nothing
significative, because that in the daily alteration of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong,
the signification of them is lost, or not commonly knowne,
which yet I hope to recover, and to make in some part
knowne, albeit they cannot easily and happily be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,

in all the significations of these names, you shall see the good
and hopefull respects which the devisers of the names had,
that there is an <HI>Orthetes</HI> or certitude of names among all
Nations according to <HI>Plate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Cratyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</NOTE> and thereby perceive that many
were translated out of the Greeke and Latine. With all we
may make this fruit by consideration of our names, which
have good, hopefull, and luckie significations, that accor∣dingly
we do carrie and conforme our selves; so that wee
faile not to be answerable to them, but be <HI>Nostri nominis
homines,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as <HI>Severus, Preb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and <HI>Aur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lus</HI> are
called <HI>Sui nominis imporatores.</HI> And accordingly it seemeth
to have beene the manner at giving of names, to wish the
children might performe and discharge their names, as
when <HI>Gunthr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> King of the French, named <HI>Clatharius</HI> at
the font, he said; <HI>Crescat puer, &amp; huius sit nominis executer.</HI></P>
<P>But before I proceed farther, this is to be noted. In most
antient times the Britans had heere their peculiar names,
for the most part taken from colours, (for they vsed to pain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
themselves) which are now lost or remaine among the
Welsh. Afterward they tooke Roman names when they
were Provincialls, which either remaine corrupted among
them, or were extinguished in the greatest part of the
Realme, after the entrance of the English <HI>Saxons,</HI> who
brought in their German names, as <HI>Cridda, Ponda, Oswald,
Edward, Vchtred, Edmund,</HI> &amp;c. Then to say nothing of the
Danes, who no doubt brought in their names, as <HI>Suayn, Ha∣rold,
Knute,</HI> &amp;c. The Normans conquest brought in other
German names, for they originally vsed the German tong,
as <HI>William, Henry, Richard, Robert, Hughe, Roger,</HI> &amp;c. as the
Greeke names,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olden dorplu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>labius, i.</HI> Innocent, <HI>Aspasious i.</HI> Delightful,
<HI>Beëthius, Symmachus. i.</HI> Helper, <HI>Texetius. i.</HI> Archer, &amp;c. were
brought into <HI>Italy</HI> after the division of the Empire. After
the Conquest, our Nation (who before would not admitte
st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nge and vnknowne names, but avoyded them therefore
as vnluckie) by little and little beganne to vse Hebrew and
<PB N="38" REF="24"/>
sacred names, as <HI>Mathew, David, Sampson, Luke, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> &amp;c.
which were never received in Germany,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of <HI>Frederick</HI> the second, about some 300. yeares since.</P>
<P>So that the <HI>Saxons, Danish, Norman,</HI> and <HI>British</HI> tongues.
are the fittest keyes to open the entrance for searching out
of our antient names yet in vse. For the Hebrew I wil follow
the common tables of the Bible, which every one may do
as well, and <HI>Philo Do nominibus mutatis.</HI> For the Greeke the
best Glossaries with mine owne little skill. For the Welsh,
I will sparingly touch them, or leave them to the learned of
that Nation. But for old English names, which heere are the
scope of my care, I must sift them as I may out of old En∣glish-<HI>Saxon</HI>
treatises, as I have happened vpon heere and
there: and some coniecturally, referring all to the iudgement
of such, as shall be more happy in finding out the truth, ho∣ping
that probability may either please, or be pardoned by
such as are modestly learned in histories and languages; to
whose iudgement in all humilitie, I commit all that is to be
said. For that they cānot but observe the diversity of names,
from the originall in divers languages, as how the French

if that word be indifferent to good and bad, which still did
die with the bearer, and never descended to posteritie. That
we may not exemplifie in other nations (which would af∣forde
great plenty,) but in our own. King <HI>Eadgar</HI> was called
the Peaceable, king <HI>Ethelred</HI> the Vnreadie, king <HI>Edmund</HI>

these names were never taken vp by the sonne, I knowe
not why any should thinke <HI>Plantagenet</HI> to be the surname

<P>Likewise in the line Royall of <HI>Scotland, Milcolme,</HI> or

<P>To seeke therefore the auntient Surnames of the royall,

of the Spanish king, or <HI>Steward</HI> of the late kings of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and now of BRITAINE, or <HI>Oldenburg</HI> of the Danish;
For (as all know that have but sipped of Histories) <HI>Valoys</HI>
was but the Apponage and Earledome of <HI>Charles</HI> yonger

and <HI>Austria</HI> were but the olde possessions of the Em∣perors
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>
and Spanish Kings progenitours. <HI>Steward</HI> was but
the name of office to <HI>Walter,</HI> who was high Steward of

that family, and of the King our Soveraigne. And <HI>Olden∣burg</HI>

<P>About the yeare of our Lord 1000. (that we may not
minute out the time) surnames beganne to be taken vp in
<HI>France,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> about the time of the Conquest, or
else a very little before, vnder King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor,
who was all Frenchified. And to this time doe the Scot∣tishmen
referre the antiquitie of their surnames,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Milcolumb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> although
<HI>Buchanan</HI> supposeth that they were not in vse in <HI>Scotland</HI>
many yeares after.</P>
<P>But in <HI>England</HI> certaine it is, that as the better sort, even
from the Conquest by little and little tooke surnames, so
they were not setled among the common people fully, vn∣till
about the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the second: but still va∣ried
according to the fathers name, as <HI>Richardson,</HI> if his fa∣ther
were <HI>Richard, Hodgeson,</HI> if his father were <HI>Roger,</HI> or in
some other respect, and from thenceforth beganne to be e∣stablished,
(some say by statute,) in their posteritie.</P>
<P>This will seeme strange to some Englishmen and Sco∣tishmen,
which like the Arcadians thinke their surnames as
ancient as the Moone, or at the least to reach many an age
beyond the Conquest. But they which thinke it most
strange, (I speake vnder correction,) I doubt they will hard∣ly
finde any surname which descended to posteritie before
that time: Neyther have they seene (I feare) any deede or

<P>But about the time of the Conquest, I observed the ve∣ry
primary beginnings as it were of many surnames, which

very lineall Progenitors bare other names within these sixe
hundred yeers. <HI>Mortimer</HI> and <HI>Warren</HI> are accounted names

<HI>Nevill</HI> of them which are now, from <HI>Robert</HI> the sonne of

tooke these surnames, when either their fathers had
none at all, or else most different, whatsoever some of their
posteritie doe overweene of the antiquitie of their names, as
though in the continuall mutabilitie of the worlde, conver∣sions

yeeres were not sufficient antiquitie for a family or name,
whenas but very few have reached thereunto.</P>

<P><HI>Many also are so changed by corruption of speach, and

<P>Many strangers also comming hither, and residing here,
were named of their Countries, as <HI>Picard, Scot, Lombard,

<P>In respect of situation to other neere places rise these v∣suall
names, <HI>Norrey, North▪ South, East, Weast▪</HI> and likewise
<HI>Northcote, Southcote, Estcote, Westcote;</HI> which also had ori∣ginally
<HI>At</HI> set before them. Yea the names of Kitchin,
Hall, Sellar, Parler, Church, Lodge &amp;c. may seeme to have
been borrowed from the places of birth, or most frequent
abode; as among the Greekes, <HI>Anato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us.</HI> i. East <HI>Zephirius,</HI>
i. Weast, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Whereas therefore these locall denominations of fami∣lies
are of no great antiquitie, I can not yet see why men
should thinke that their Auncestours gave names to pla∣ces,
when the places bare those very names, before anie
men did their Surnames. Yea the very terminations of
the names are such as are onely proper and appliable to
places, and not to persons in their significations, if any will
marke the Locall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erminations which I lately specified.
Who would suppose Hil, Wood, Field, Ford, Ditch, Pole,
Pond, Towne, or Ton, and such like terminations to bee
convenient for men to beare in their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes, vnlesse they
could also dreame Hilles, Woods, Fieldes, Fordes, Ponds,
Pounds &amp;c. to have beene m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tamorphosed into men by
some supernaturall transformation.</P>
<P>And I doubt not but they will confesse that Townes
stand longer then families continue.</P>
<P>It may also be prooved that many places which nowe
have Lordes denominated of them, had Lordes and ow∣ners
of other Surnames, and families not many hundred
yeeres since. But a sufficient proofe it is of anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt descent
where the inhabitant had his Surname of the place where
he inhabiteth, as <HI>Compton</HI> of <HI>Compton, Terringham</HI> of <HI>Ter∣ringham,
Egerton</HI> of <HI>Egerton, Portington</HI> of <HI>Portington, Skef∣fington</HI>
of <HI>Skeffington, Beeston</HI> of <HI>Beeston, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I know neverthelesse, that albeit most Townes have
borrowed their names from their situation, and other re∣spectes;
yet some with apt terminations have their names
<PB N="107" REF="58"/>
from men, as <HI>Edwarston, Alfredston, Vbsford, Malmesbury,</HI>
corruptly for <HI>Maidu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sbury.</HI> But these names were from
fore-names or Christian names, and not fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Surnames.
For <HI>Ingulphus</HI> plainely sheweth, that <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burton▪</HI> and <HI>Lef∣frington</HI>
were so named,<NOTE PLACE="marg">pag. 491.</NOTE> because two knights, <HI>Wiburt,</HI> and
<HI>Leofric</HI> there sometimes inhabited. But if any should af∣firme
that the Gentlemen named <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>frington, Wiburton,
Lancaster,</HI> or <HI>Leicester, Bossevill,</HI> or <HI>Shordich,</HI> gave the
names to the places so named, I woulde humbly, without
preiudice, crave respite for a further day before I beleeved
them. And to say as I thinke, verily when they shall better
advise themselves, and marke well the terminations of
these, and such like Locall names, they will not presse me
ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r eagrely heerein.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, certaine it is that Surnames of fami∣lies
have beene adioyned to the names of places for distin∣ction,
or to notifie the owner, as <HI>Melton Mowbray, High∣am
Ferrers, Minster-L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vel, Stansted Rivers, Drayton-Bas∣set,
Drayton-Beauchamp, &amp;c.</HI> for that they were the posses∣sions
of <HI>Mowbray, Ferrers, Level, &amp;c.</HI> Neither do I denie,
but some among vs in former time, aswell as now, dream∣ing
of immortalitie of their names, have named their hou∣ses
after their owne names, as <HI>Camois-Court, Hamons,
Bretts, Bailies, Theobaldes,</HI> whenas now they have posses∣sors
of other names. And the olde verse is, and alwayes
will be verified of them, which a right worshipfull friend
of mine not long since writ vpon his new house:
<Q>Nunc mea, mox <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uius, sed posteà nescio cuius.</Q></P>
<P>Neither must all, having their names from places, sup∣pose
that their Auncestors were either Lordes, or posses∣sors
of them; but may assure themselves, that they origi∣nally
came from them, or were borne at them. But the
Germans and Polonians doe cleare this errour by placing
<HI>In</HI> before the Locall names, if they are possessours of the
place, or <HI>Of,</HI> if they onelie were borne at them, as <HI>Marti∣nus
<PB N="108" REF="59"/>
Cromerus</HI> noteth. The like also seemeth to be in vse in
the Marches of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for there you shall have <HI>Trotter</HI>
of <HI>Folshaw,</HI> and <HI>Trotter</HI> in <HI>Fogo, Haitly</HI> of <HI>Haitly,</HI> and <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ly</HI>
in <HI>Haitly.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas since the time of king <HI>Henry</HI> the third the
Princes children tooke names from their natall places, as
<HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Carnarvon, Thomas</HI> of <HI>Brotherton, Ioann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>A∣cres,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dmund</HI> of <HI>Woodstocke, Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> who named his
children by <HI>Cath. Swinford, Beaufort</HI> of the place wher they

of thē whenas they never desc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded to their posteritie.</P>
<P>After this locall names, the most names in number
have beene derived from Occupations, or Professions, as
Taylor, Potter, Smith, Sadler, Arblaster, that is, <HI>Balistarius,</HI>
Archer, Taverner, Chauser, <HI>i.</HI> Hosier, Weaver, Pointer,

Neither was there any trade, craft, arte, profession, occupa∣tion

name, <HI>Musonius.</HI> But what names the beastly monster, ra∣ther
than Emperour <HI>Commmodus</HI> gave to his attendants, I
dare not mention, lest I should be immodestly offensive to
chaste eares, and modest mindes. But hitherto with mo∣desty
may be referred this of the familie of <HI>Gephyri,</HI> i. <HI>Brid∣ges</HI>
in <HI>Greece,</HI> who tooke their name from a Bridge; for
vvhen their mother was delivered of nine children at a
birth, and in a foolish feare had privily sent seven of them
to be drowned at a bridge, the father sodainely comming
to the bridge, saved them, and thereupon gave them that
name. Of these, and the like, we may say, <HI>Propi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra sunt ho∣nori,
quàm ignominiae.</HI> Infinite are the occasions which in
like manner have made names to persons, I will onely re∣porte
one or two French examples, that thereby you may
imagine of others in other places and former ages.</P>
<P>In the first broyles of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> certaine companies ran∣ging
themselves into troupes, one Captaine tooke newe
names to himselfe and his company from the furniture of
an horse. Among these new named gallants, you might
have heard of, <HI>Monsieur Saddle,</HI> (to english them) <HI>Moun∣sieur
Bridle, Le Croupier, Le Girte, Horsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, Bitte, Trappiers,
Hoofe, Stirrope, Curbe, Musrole, Frontstall, &amp;c.</HI> Most of the
which had their pasport, as my Author noteth, by <HI>Seign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
de la Halter.</HI> Another Captaine there also gave names to
his, according to the places where he found thē, as <HI>Hodge,
Hieway, River, Pond, Vine, Stable, Street, Corner, Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws, Ta∣verne,
Tree, &amp;c.</HI> And I have heard of a consort in <HI>England,</HI>
who when they had served at Sea, tooke names from the
equipage of a shippe, when they would serve themselves
<PB N="119" REF="64"/>
at land, as, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Ball<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, Planke, F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re-decke, Decke, Loope∣hole,
Pumpe, Rudder, Gable, Anchor, Misen saile, Capson,
Maste, Bolt..</HI> So that is true which <HI>Isidore</HI> saieth, <HI>Names are
not alwayes given according to Nature, but some after our
owne will and pleasure, as we name our landes and servants ac∣cording
to our owne liking.</HI> And the Dutchmans saying may
be verified, which when he heard of, Englishmen called
God and Divell, saide, that the English borrowed names
from all things whatsoever, good or bad.</P>
<P>It might be heere questioned, whether these surnames
were assumed and taken at the first by the persons them∣selves,
or imposed and given vnto them by others. It may
aswell seeme that the locall names of persons were partely
taken vp by themselves, if they were owners of the place,
as given by the people, who have the soveraignty of words
and names, as they did in the Nicke-names before Sur∣names
were in vse. For who would have named himselfe,
Peaceable, Vnready, Without-land, Beauclerke, Strong∣bow,
Gagtooth, Blanch-mayne, Bossue, i. Crook-backe,
but the concurrent voyce of the people, as the women
neighbours gave the name to <HI>Obed</HI> in the booke of <HI>Ruth;</HI>
and likewise in Surnames. In these pretty names, as I may
terme them, from floures, fishes, birdes, habitudes, &amp;c: it
may bee thought that they came from Nurses in former
times heere, as very many, or rather most in <HI>Ireland</HI> and
<HI>Wales</HI> doe at this present. These Nicke-names of one sil∣lable
turned to surnames, as <HI>Dickes, Nickes, Toms, Hobbes,
&amp;c.</HI> may also seeme to proceed from Nurses, to their Nur∣slings;
or from fathers and maisters to their boyes and ser∣vants.
For, as according to the old proverb, <HI>Omnis herus
serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Monosyllabus,</HI> in respect of their short commands: so
<HI>Omnis servus har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Monosyllabus</HI> in respect of the curtolling
their names, as <HI>Wil, Sim, Hodge, &amp;c.</HI> Neither is it improba∣ble,
but that many names that seeme vnfitting for men, as
of brutish beasts, &amp;c. came frō the very signes of the hou∣ses
where they inhabited; for I have heard of them which
said they spake of knowledge, that some in late time dwel∣ling
<PB N="120" REF="65"/>
at the signe of the Dolphin, Dull, White-horse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ket,
Peacocke, &amp;c. were commonly called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> at the
<HI>Dolphin, Will</HI> at the <HI>Bull, George</HI> at the <HI>White horse, Robin</HI>

omitting <HI>At,</HI> became afterward herod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le to their children.</P>
<P>Heereby some insight may bee had in the originall of
Surnames, yet it is a matter of great difficultie, to being
them all to certain heads, whenas our language is so great∣ly
altered, so many new names daily brought in by Aliens,
as French, Scots, Irish, Welch, Dutch, &amp;c. and so many old
words worne out of vse. I meane not only in the old En∣glish,
but also the late Norman, for who knoweth nowe
what these names were, <HI>Giffard, Basset, Gernon, Mallet, Ho∣ward,
Peverell, Paganell,</HI> or <HI>Paynell, Taile boise, Talb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vet,
Panc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>volt, Tirrell, &amp;c.</HI> which are nothing lesse than locall,
and certainely significative, for they are never noted, as I
said before in olde evidences with <HI>De</HI> as locall names, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
alwayes absolutely, as <HI>W. Giffard, R. Basset,</HI> as Christian
names are, when they are made Surnames; and yet I will
not affirme, that all these heere mentioned were at anie
time Christian names, although doubtlesse some were.</P>
<P>For wee knowe the significations of some of them, as

Duke of <HI>Norffolke,</HI> an especial searcher of Antiquities, who
equalleth his high parentage with his vertues, hath lately

<P>To find out the true originall of Surnames,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Change of names</NOTE> is full of dif∣ficulty,
so it is not easie to search all the causes of alterati∣ons
<PB N="121" REF="65"/>
of Surnames, which in former ages have beene verie
common among vs, and have so intricated, or rather, ob∣scured
the trueth of our Pedegrees, that it will be no little
hard labour to deduce many of them truly from the Con∣quest;
Somewhat neverthelesse shall be said thereof, but
more shall be left for them which will sound deeper into
this matter.</P>
<P>To speake of alteration of names, omitting them of
<HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Sara, Iacob,</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> in holy Scriptures,
I have observed that the change of names, hath most com∣monly
proceeded from a desire to avoyd the opinion of

deified by the Paganish consecration, as <HI>Romulus</HI> was cal∣led
<HI>Quirmus, Melicertus</HI> was called <HI>Portunus,</HI> and <HI>Palaemon,</HI>
Likewise in adoptions into better families and testament,
as the sonne of <HI>L. Aemilius,</HI> adopted by <HI>Scipio,</HI> tooke the
name of <HI>Scipio Africanus.</HI> So <HI>Augustus</HI> who was first na∣med
<HI>Thureon,</HI> tooke the name of <HI>Octavian</HI> by testament:
by enfranchising also into new Citties, as he which first
was called <HI>Lucumo,</HI> when he was infranchised at <HI>Rome,</HI>
tooke the name of <HI>Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.</HI> So <HI>Deme∣trius
Mega</HI> when he was there made free of the Citty, was
called <HI>Publius Cornelius. Cicero Epist. 36. lib.</HI> 13.</P>
<P>Likewise slaves when they were manumised, tooke
often their masters names, whenas they had but one name
in their servile state. As they which have read <HI>Artemidorus,</HI>
do know, how a slave, who when he dreamed he had <HI>tria

<P>As among the French in former time, and also nowe,
the heire tooke the fathers surname, and the yonger sonnes
tooke names of their landes allotted vnto them. So like∣wise
in times past did they in <HI>England;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib Prioratus de Wroxhall.</NOTE> and the most com∣mon

brethren fled, tooke the name of <HI>Welsborne,</HI> as some of that

<P>Bnt for varietie and alteration of names in one familie
vpon divers respects, I will give you one <HI>Cheshire</HI> exam∣ple
for all, out of an antient roule belonging to sir <HI>William
Brerton</HI> of <HI>Brerton</HI> knight, which I sawe twenty yeares
since. Not long after the Conquest <HI>William Bellward</HI> lord
of the moietie of <HI>Malpasse,</HI> had two sonnes, <HI>Dan-David</HI> of
<HI>Malpasse,</HI> surnamed <HI>Le Clerke,</HI> and <HI>Richard; Dan-David</HI>
had <HI>William</HI> his eldest sonne surnamed <HI>De Malpasse,</HI> from
whom the Baron <HI>Dudley</HI> is descended by heire generall.
His second sonne was named <HI>Philip Gogh,</HI> one of the issue
of whose eldest sonnes tooke the name of <HI>Egerton;</HI> a third

also divers names, <HI>viz. Thomas de C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tgrave, William de O∣verton,</HI>
and <HI>Richard Little,</HI> who had two sonnes, the one
named <HI>Ken-clarke,</HI> and the other <HI>Iohn Richardson.</HI> Heerein
you may note alteration of names in respect of habitation

of learning in <HI>Ken-clarke,</HI> in respect of the fathers Christi∣an
name in <HI>Richardson,</HI> all descending from <HI>William Bell∣ward.</HI>
And verily the Gentlemen of those so different
names in <HI>Cheshire</HI> would not easily be induced to beleeve
they were descended from one house, if it were not war∣ranted
by so antient a proofe.</P>
<P>In respect of stature I could recite to you other exam∣ples,
but I will onely adde this which I have read, that a
yong Gentleman of the house of <HI>Preux,</HI> being of tall sta∣ture
attending on the Lord <HI>Hungerford,</HI> Lord Treasourer
of <HI>England,</HI> was among his fellowes called Long <HI>H:</HI> who
after preferred to a good marriage by his Lorde, was called
<HI>H. Long,</HI> that name continued to his posteritie, knights and
men of great worship.</P>
<P>Other took their mothers surnames, as <HI>A. Audley</HI> yon∣ger

and heire of <HI>H. de Stanley</HI> left a sonne <HI>William,</HI> that tooke

Likewise <HI>Ralph Gernon</HI> marrying the daughter of <HI>Caven∣dish,</HI>
or <HI>Candish,</HI> left that name to his issue, as <HI>Th: Talbot,</HI>
a learned Genealogist hath prooved. So <HI>Robert Meg</HI> the

whereof his mother was one of the heires. So sir <HI>Iohn de

<HI>Burnell,</HI> his posteritie tooke the name of <HI>Burnell.</HI> So sir

<P>Heerevnto may they also bee referred who changed
their names in remembrance of their Progenitours being
more honourable, as the sonnes of <HI>Geffrey Fitz-Petre,</HI>
tooke the name of <HI>Magnavilla</HI> or <HI>Mandevile,</HI> when they
came to be Earles of <HI>Essex,</HI> because their grandmother <HI>Be∣atrix</HI>
was of the house of <HI>Mandevile,</HI> as appeareth by the
Abby booke of <HI>Walden.</HI> So <HI>Thomas de Molton</HI> tooke the

<P>Others also have taken the name of them whose lands
they had: As when King <HI>Henry</HI> the first gave the lands of

heires were married into the families of <HI>Howard</HI> and
<HI>Barkeley.</HI></P>
<P>Remembrance of benefits made others to change their
names, as <HI>William Mortimer</HI> descended from those of <HI>Ri∣chards</HI>
Castle, tooke the name of <HI>La-Zouch,</HI> and named
his sonne <HI>Alan de la-Zouch,</HI> for some favour received from
the Lord <HI>Zouch</HI> of <HI>Ashby de la-Zouch,</HI> as appeareth by <HI>In∣quisition.</HI>
11. &amp; 21. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>In respect of adoption also, very many in all ages have
changed their names: I neede not particulate it, for all know
it. Some of their owne dislike of their names, have alte∣red
them: for as I have read in the booke of <HI>Fornesse, Wil∣liam
Fitz-Gilbert</HI> Baron of <HI>Kendall,</HI> obtained licence of
King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, to change his name and call him∣selfe
and his posteritie <HI>Lancaster,</HI> from whom the <HI>Lanca∣sters</HI>

<P>Heerevpon some thinke that without the Kings li∣cence
new names cannot be taken, or old names given a∣way
to others. Yet <HI>Tiraquell</HI> the great <HI>Civilian</HI> of <HI>France, in
Leg. quin. Conub. Tit.</HI> 92. seemeth to incline, that both name
and Armes may be transferred by will and testament, and
produceth <HI>Augustus,</HI> who by his Testament commanded
<HI>Tiberius</HI> and <HI>Livia</HI> to beare his name. How in former times
<HI>Herevile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Wirl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</NOTE> <HI>Dunvile, Clauwowe,</HI> gave and granted away their
Armes, which are as silent names, distinctions of families;
and the same was thought vnlawfull afterward, when the
Lord <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> would have done the same, shall be declared in
more convenient place. But the inconvenience of change
of names, hath beene discovered to be such in <HI>France,</HI> that
it hath beene pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pounded in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that it
<PB N="127" REF="68"/>
should not be permitted but in these two respects, eyther
when one should bee made heire to any with especiall
words, to assume the name of the testatour; or when any
one should have a donation surmounting a thousand
crownes, vpon the same condition. But to retyre to our
purpose.</P>
<P>Not a few have assumed the names of their fathers
Baronies, as in former times the issue of <HI>Richard Fitz-Gil∣bert,</HI>
tooke the name of <HI>Clare,</HI> which was their Barony: and
in late time, since the <HI>Suttons</HI> came to the Barony of <HI>Dud∣ley,</HI>
all their issue tooke the name of <HI>Dudleyes:</HI> that I may
omit others. The dislike of others hath caused also a
change of names, for King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, disliking the
iteration of <HI>Fitz,</HI> commanded the Lord <HI>Iohn Fitz-Robert,</HI>
a most ancient Baron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Monasterii Sibeton.</NOTE> (whose Ancestours had continued
their Surnames by their fathers Christian names,) to leave
that manner, and to be called <HI>Iohn Clavering,</HI> which was
the capitall seate of his Barony. And in this time, many that
had followed that course of naming by <HI>Fitz,</HI> tooke them
one setled name, and retained it as <HI>Fitz Walter,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Also at that time the names of <HI>Thomson, Richardson,
Willson,</HI> and other of that forme began to be setled, which
before had varied according to the name of the father. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the fourth likewise (as I have heard,) loving some
whose name was <HI>Picard,</HI> would often tell them that hee
loved them well, but not their names, wherevpon some of
them changed their names: and I have heard that one of
them which tooke the name of <HI>Ruddle,</HI> being the place of
his birth in that respect. And in late yeares in the time of
King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, an ancient worshipfull gentleman
of <HI>Wales,</HI> being called at the panniell of Iury by the name
of <HI>Thomas Ap William, Ap Thomas, Ap Richard, Ap Hoel,
Ap Evan Ʋaghan, &amp;c.</HI> was advised by the Iudge to leave
that old manner. Wherevpon he after called himselfe <HI>Mo∣ston,</HI>
according to the name of his principall house, and left
that Surname to his posterity.</P>
<P>Offices have brought new names to divers families, as
<PB N="128" REF="69"/>
when <HI>Edward Fitz-Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bald,</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
the Earles of <HI>Ormond</HI> and others descended from them,
tooke the name of <HI>Butler.</HI> So the distinct families of the
<HI>Constables</HI> in the County of <HI>Yorke,</HI> are saide to have ta∣ken
that name, from some of their Ancestours which bare
the office of Constables of some Castles. In Like manner
the <HI>Stewards, Marshalls, Spencers.</HI> That I may say nothing
of such as for well acting on the stage, have carried away
the names of the personages which they acted, and have
lost their owne names among the people.</P>
<P>Schollers pride hath wrought alteration in some names
which have beene sweetned in sound, by drawing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem to
the Latine <HI>Analog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> As that notable Non-resident in our
fathers time Doctor <HI>Magnus,</HI> who being a foundling at
<HI>Newark</HI> vppon <HI>Trent,</HI> where hee erected a Grammer
schoole, was called by the people <HI>T. Among vs,</HI> for that he
was found among them: But he profiting in learning, tur∣ned
<HI>Among vs,</HI> into <HI>Magnus,</HI> and was famous by that name,
not onely heere, but also in forraine places where he was
often Ambassadour.</P>
<P>It were needelesse to note heere againe, how many
have taken in former times the Christian name of their
father, with prefixing of <HI>Fitz</HI> or <HI>Filz,</HI> as <HI>Fitz-bugh, Fitz-alan,
Fitz-william,</HI> or adding of <HI>Son,</HI> as <HI>Richardson, Tomson,
Iohnson, &amp;c.</HI> and so altered their Surnames if they had any.
Whereas divers ancient Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> do beare
Coates of Armes, which by old roules and good proofes
are knowne to belong to other names and families, and
cannot make proofe that they matched with those fami∣lies,
it is worth observation, considering how religious
they were in elder times in keeping their owne Armes:
whether they were not of those ancient houses whose
Armes they beare, and have changed their names in re∣spect
of their habitation, or partitions and lands gotten by
their wives. As <HI>Pickering</HI> of the North, beareth Ermin a
Lion rampant Azure crowned, Or, which, as it is in the
old Abby booke of <HI>Furnesse,</HI> was the coat of <HI>Roger de Miy∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rp.</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="69"/>
In the same booke the coate of <HI>Dacr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Gules 3. Esca∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pes
Arg.</HI> is the coate of <HI>R. Ger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th</HI> of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and so
the three pillowes Ermin of <HI>Redman</HI> of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> is
the coate of <HI>Ran. de Greystock.</HI> So <HI>Ʋfford</HI> E. of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and
<HI>Peit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Fetiplace,</HI> and <HI>Hide,</HI> and many other Gentlemen of
the same Armes, may seeme to haue beene of the same
stocke, and to haue varied their names in diuers respects.</P>
<P>Finally, among the common people which sway all in
names, many Surnames haue bene changed in respect of
occupations, and not a few have beene changed in respect
of masters, for in every place we see the youth very com∣monly
called by the names of their ocupations, as <HI>Iohn</HI> Ba∣ker,
<HI>Thomas</HI> Taylor, <HI>Will</HI> Butcher, <HI>Dic</HI> Barber, and many
by their masters names, as <HI>Iohn Pickering, Thomas Watkins,
Nicholas French,</HI> whenas they served maisters of those
names, which often were conveyed to their posteritie, and
their owne Surnames altogether forgotten. Some other
causes of alteration of names may be found, as for crimes
committed when men have beene enforced to leave their
countries. But heereby it may be vnderstood that an <HI>Alias</HI>
or double name cannot preiudice the honest: and it is
knowne that when Iudge <HI>Catiline</HI> tooke exception at one
in this respect, saying, that no honest man had a double
name, &amp; came in with an <HI>Alias.</HI> The party asked him what
exception his Lordship could take to Iesus Christ, Alias,
Iesus of <HI>Nazareth.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not but some men among vs in changing their
names, do imitate olde Goffer <HI>Simon</HI> the Cobbler in <HI>Lu∣cian,</HI>
who when he grew fat in the purse, would needes be
called for Goodman <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on.</HI> Master <HI>Simonides,</HI> as some wo∣men
do follow the good Greeke wench, <HI>Melissarton,</HI> that
is, Pretty honny-Bee, who when of a Commediant shee
became a wealthy mans wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> would be saluted Madam
<HI>Pithias,</HI> or <HI>Prudence.</HI> And some likewise can change them∣selves
from shee, to hee, and consequeetly their name, as
<HI>Cenis</HI> the wench, into <HI>Ceneus</HI> the yong man, as you may
see in <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="70"/>
Among the alteration of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
how Kings of Armes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are

him, and immediately created him Herold, by the
name of <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>Heere might I note that women with vs at their mar∣riage
do change their surnames and passe into their hus∣bands
names, and iustly for that then <HI>Non sunt du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sed car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>Thus much of Christian names and Surnames, or <HI>Prae∣nomina</HI>

<P>As for additions given over and beside names, and sur∣names
in Law causes, that I may note them out of a Lawe
booke, they are either of estate, or degree, or mysterie, or
towne, or hamlet, or countie. Addition of estate are these;
Yeoman, Gentleman, Esquire. Addition of degree are
those which wee call names of dignitie, as Knight, Earle,
Marquesse, Duke. Additions of mysterie are such, Scrive∣ner,
Carpenter, Smith. Addition of townes, as of <HI>Pading∣ton,
Islington, Edelmeton.</HI> And where a man hath houshold
in two places, he shall be saide to dwell in both of them, so
that his addition in one of them doth suffice.</P>
<P>By the Statute the first yeere of king <HI>Henry</HI> the fift and
fift chapter, it was ordained, that in suites or in actions
where processe of Vtary lieth, such addition should be
to the name of the Defendant, to shew his estate, myste∣rie,
and place where he dwelleth, and that such Writts shall
abate, if they have not such additions, if the Defendant do
take exception thereat, they shall not abate by the office of
the court.</P>
<P>Also, Duke, Marquesse, Earle, or Knight be none of
that addition, but names of dignitie, which should have
beene given before the statute. Aud this was ordained by
the sayde statnte, made in the first yeare of king <HI>Henry</HI> the
seaventh chap. 5. to the intent that one man may not be
grieved or troubled by the vtlary of an other, but that by
reason of the certaine addition every man might be cer∣tainely
knowne, and beare his owne burden.</P>
<P>How the names of them which for capitall crimes a∣gainst

Somewhat might be said here of the adjuncts to names
or titles, which in most antient times were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther none, or
most simple. For <HI>Augustus</HI> was impatient to be called <HI>Do∣min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>
yet <HI>Domitian</HI> liked well to be called <HI>Dom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus Deus{que}</HI>
and <HI>Dominus</HI> was taken vp by everie private man, as ap∣peereth

Nevertheles it was never vsed by the Emperors, from <HI>Do∣mitian</HI>
to <HI>Dioclesianus,</HI> as <HI>Victor</HI> noteth; but afterward it
was continued by the Christian Emperors, yea vpon their
Coines.</P>
<P>And that which is more strange, they vsed then as ap∣peareth
in the Constitutions, for themselves. <HI>Aeternitat

Princes therewith.</P>
<P>The Romans vnder the latter Emperours had a verie
curious and carefull observation, in giving titles to men of

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>N Imprese (as the Italians call it) is a de∣vise
in picture with his Motte, or Word,
borne by noble and learned personages,
to notifie some particular conceit of their
owne: as Emblemes (that we may omitte
other differences) doe propound some
generall instruction to all: As for example: Wheras <HI>Cos∣mi
Medici</HI> Doke of <HI>Florence</HI> had in the ascendent at his
nativitie the signe <HI>Capricorue,</HI> vnder which also <HI>Augustus</HI>
and <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, two great and good Princes were
borne: hee vsed the celeshall signe <HI>Capricorne,</HI> with this
Mone; <HI>FIDEM FATI VIRTVTE SE QVEMVR</HI>
for his Imprese, particularly concerning his good hope
to proove like vnto them. But a faire woman pictured
with an Olive crowne representing <HI>Peace,</HI> carrying in
one hand the horne of Plenty, leading a little golden boy
for <HI>Plutus</HI> in the other, with, <HI>EX PACE RERVM
OPVLENTIA,</HI> is an Embleme, and a generall document
to all, that Peace bringeth Plentie.</P>
<P>There is required in an Imprese (that wee may reduce
them to few heades) a correspondencie of the picture,
which is as the bodie, and the Motte, which as the soule
giveth it life. That is, the body must be of faire represen∣tation,
and the word in some different language, wittie,
short, and answerable thereunto neither too obscur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
too plaine, and most comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded, when it is an <HI>Hemislich,</HI>
or parcell of a verse.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="84"/>
According to these prescripts neither the starres with

dragon in <HI>Pindare,</HI> neither the stemme of a shippe v∣sed
for a seale by <HI>Pompey,</HI> can have heere place: Much
lesse the reverses in Roman coynes, which were onely hi∣storicall
memorialles of their actes; as that of <HI>Claudius,</HI>
with a plowman at plow and this <HI>COL: CAMALODVN</HI>
was to signifie that he made <HI>Maldon</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssex</HI> a Colony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Britannia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and
that of <HI>Hadrian</HI> with an Emperour, three souldiers, and
<HI>EXERC: BRITANNICVS</HI> was in memorie of some
good service by the three Legions resiant in this Isle at
<HI>Yorke, Chester,</HI> and <HI>Car-leon</HI> vpon <HI>Ʋske.</HI> That also of <HI>Se∣verus</HI>
with a woman sitting vppon Cliffes holding an en∣signe
in one hand, and as it were writing vppon a shield,
with <HI>VICTORIA BRITANN:</HI> was onely to shew his
victories here.</P>
<P>Such also as are set downe in <HI>Notitia Provinciarum,</HI> as
a Boore seiant for <HI>Iovij,</HI> a circle party <HI>per Saltier</HI> for <HI>Bri∣tanniciani,</HI>
a carbuncle (as Blazoners terme it) for <HI>Britan∣nici,
&amp;c.</HI> cannot be admitted into the number of <HI>Impreses,</HI>
for they were the severall ensignes of severall militarie com¦panies,
whereof the two last seemed to be leavied out of
this Isle.</P>
<P>Childish it is to referre hither the shieldes of King <HI>Ar∣thurs</HI>
round-table Knights, when they were devised, as it
is probable, for no other end, but to teach yoong men the
termes of Blazon.</P>
<P>Neither are Armes to be referred hither, which were
devised to distinguish families, and were most vsuall a∣mong
the nobilitie in warres, tiltes and tournaments in
their coates called <HI>Coate-armours, Shields, Standards, Ban∣ners,
Pennors, Guydons,</HI> vntill about some hundred yeeres
since, when the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> in the expedition of
<HI>Naples,</HI> vnder <HI>Charles</HI> the eight beganne to leave Armes,
happly for that many of them had none, and to beare the
curtaines of their mistresses beddes, their mistresses co∣lours,
or these Impreses in their banners, shields, and ca∣parisons:

<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the second grievously molested by the dis∣obedience

yong chickens, whereof three pecked and scratched him,
the fourth picked at his eyes. This his devise had no life,
because it had no Motte: but his answer gave it life, when
he said to one demaunding his meaning, That they were
his sonnes which did so pecke him, and that <HI>Iohn</HI> the yon∣gest

<P>The victorious <HI>Blacke Prince</HI> his sonne vsed sometimes
one feather, sometime three, in token of his speedy execu∣tion
in all his services, as the Postes in the Roman times
were <HI>Pterophori,</HI> and wore feathers to signifie their flying

a Faulcon in a fetter-locke, implying that he was locked
vp from all hope and possibility of the Kingdome, when

asked on a time his sonnes when he saw them, beholding
this devise set vp in a window, what was Latine for a fet∣ter-locke:

<P>Heavenly cogitations were in him, who onely figured
a man kneeling, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is hands lifted vp to the heavens,
with this inscribede, <HI>SVPREMA OPTIMA MVNDI.</HI></P>
<P>A verie good invention was that to shew his stay and
support by a virgin Prince, who presented in his shield,
the Zodiacke with the Characters onely of <HI>Leo</HI> and <HI>Vir∣go,</HI>
and this word, <HI>HIS EGO PRAESIDIIS.</HI></P>
<P>It may bee thought that he noted deserts to bee everie
where excluded, and meere happe to raise most men, who
inscribed within a Laurell Garland, <HI>FATO, NON
MERITO.</HI></P>
<P>A lavish tongue might seeme to have damnified the
Gentleman which tooke for his device Landskip, as they
call it, and solitarie Mountaines, with <HI>TVTI MONTES,
TVTVM SILENTIVM.</HI></P>
<P>He had no great care to exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esse his conceit in an Im∣prese,
which neverthelesse he did expresse, which bare a
white shield enscribed, <HI>NEC CVRA, NEC CHA∣RACTER.</HI></P>
<P>No Knight of <HI>Venus</HI> was he, who as triumphing over
her force, bare her Sonne winged <HI>Cupid</HI> in a nette, with
<HI>QVI CAPIT, CAPITVR.</HI></P>
<P>The Starre called <HI>Spica Virginis,</HI> one of the fifteene
which are accompted to be of the first magnitude among
the Astronomers, with a scrole in written, <HI>MIHI VITA
SPICA VIRGINIS,</HI> declared thereby happly, that hee
had that Starre in the ascendent at his Nativitie, or rather,
that he lived by the gracious favour of a virgin Prince.</P>
<P>One in our sea-faring age adventuring himselfe and all
he had to the Seas, proposing no certaine arrivall to him∣selfe,
made a Ship with full sayles in the Sea, and superscri∣bed,
<HI>PORTVS IN IGNOTO.</HI></P>
<P>His minde mounted above the meane, which devised
for himselfe, one that had clambred much more then halfe
the way of a sleepe Mountaine, adding this worde neere
him, <HI>DIXERVNT FATVI,</HI> omitting the other part of
<PB N="169" REF="90"/>
the verse, <HI>Medicum tenuere beati.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise he hoped to attaine the height of his desire,
which made one climing to the middle of a <HI>Piramis,</HI> with
<HI>HAC SPE,</HI> by him, and <HI>ILLIC SPES</HI> aboue him.</P>
<P>Another also which climed in his conceyt, but as it see∣meth
fearing a fall, made a man vpon the vpp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r degree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
a Ladder, with this Mot adioyned, <HI>NON QVO, SED
VNDE CADO.</HI></P>
<P>He referred Fate, Fortune and all to his Soveraigne,
which drew for himselfe the twelve houses of heaven, in
the forme which <HI>Astrologians</HI> vse, setting downe neither
Signe, nor Planet therein, but onely placing over it this
worde, <HI>DISPONE.</HI></P>
<P>The like reference had he which onely vsed a white
Shield, and therein written, <HI>FATVM INSCRIBAT
ELIZA.</HI></P>
<P>It may bee doubtfull whether hee affected his Sove∣raigne,
or iustice more zealously, which made a man ho∣vering
in the aire, with <HI>FEROR AD ASTAEAM.</HI></P>
<P>You may easily coniecture what he conceyued, who in
his shield reared an Oare with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aile fastned therevnto,
adding. <HI>FORS ET VIRTVS MISCENTVR IN V∣NVM.</HI></P>
<P>Full of loving affection was he to his Ladie, which bare
a Rose vpon his pricking branch, and <HI>ABIGITQVE
TRAHITQVE.</HI></P>
<P>With many a blustring blast he seemed to have beene
tossed, which painted an Horizon, with all the Cardinall

<P>Whereas the Laurell sacred to learning is never hurt by

to be painted for him a Cocke vnder a Laurell, with,

An amorous affection was onely noted in him which set

<P>Hee proposed to himselfe honour in Martiall seruice,

with this word, <HI>IT COMES.</HI></P>
<P>A Gentleman scholler drawne from the Vniversitie
where he was well liked to the Court, for which in respect
of his bashfull modestie, he was not so fit; painted a red
corall branch, which while it grew in the sea was greene,
with this, <HI>NVNC RVBEO, ANTE VIREBAM.</HI></P>
<P>Master <HI>Richard Carew</HI> of <HI>Anthony,</HI> when he was in his
tender yeares, devised for himselfe an Adamant vpon an
Anvile, with a hand holding an hammer thereover, and
this Italian <HI>Motto, CHE VERACE DVRERA:</HI> which
also contained his name Anagranimatically.</P>
<P>He seemed not to be sufficiently warmed, living in the
Sun-shine of the Court, which framed for his devise a
glasse of Parabolicall concavitie, or burning glasse as some
call it, with the Sunne shining over it, and a combustible
matter kindled vnder it, with <HI>NEC DVM CALES∣CO.</HI></P>
<P>He doubted not but continuall suit would molifie his

<P>He lacked but some gracious hand to effect some mat∣ter
well forward, which made more then halfe a circle with

<P>His conceit was godly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owe spondent to his name,

<P>When the Spania<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds purposed the invasion 1588, and
their Navie was scattered to their confusion, by a ship fi∣erd
and carried among them by direction from her late

<P>This calles another to my remembrance, which I have seen

<P>About that time, vvhen some dislikes grew betweene
the English and the States of the vnited Provinces, they
fearing that it might tend to the hurt of both, caused to be

<P>He might seeme to reach at some of <HI>Vulcans</HI> order,

their functions, onely the stomacke lay ydle and consumed
all. Hereuppon they ioyntly agreed al to forbeare their labors,
and to pine away their lasie and publike enemy. One day passed
over, the second followed very tedious, but the third day was
so grievous to them all, that they called a common Counsel; The
eyes waxed d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mme, the feete could not support the body, the
armes waxed lasie, the tongue faltered, and could not lay open
the matter; Therefore they all with one accord desired the ad∣vise
of the Heart. There Reason layd open before them, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee against whome they had proclaimed warres, was the cause
of all this their misery: For he as their common steward, when
his allowances were withdrawne, of necessitie withdrew theirs
fro them, as not receiving that he might allow. Therfore it were
a farre better course to supply him, than that the limbs should
faint with hunger. So by the perswasion of Reason, the stomacke
was served, the limbes comforted, and peace re-established.
Even so it fareth with the bodies of Common-weales; for albeit
the Princes gather much, yet not so much for themselves, as for
others: So that if they want, they cannot supply the want of o∣thers;
therefore do not repine at Princes heerein, but respect
the common good of the whole publike estate. [Idem.</P>

he in greatnes of courage protested in these wordes, <HI>I will

performance of which his princely word, hee caused the

eight chapter of the saide Booke. <HI>This Prince was of such
prowesse, that he was more feared and redoubted amongest the

when as their little infants beganne to crie, their mothers would
say to make them holde their peace; King Richard commeth,

send him backe vnto his flocke. Whereuppon the King
sent vnto the Pope the armour that he was taken in, and
willed his Ambassadour to vse the words of <HI>Iacobs</HI> sonnes

<HI>Richard</HI> brotherly to pardon his manifolde offen∣ces,
that he had vnbrotherly committed against him, hee
rehersed the straight league of brotherly piety, he recoun∣ted
the many merits of his brother, he bewailed with teares
that hitherto he had beene vnmindefull of them, as an vn∣naturall
and vnthankefull person. Finally, that hee dooth
live, and shall live, hee dooth acknowledge that hee hath
received it at his handes. The king being mollified with
this humble submission, saide: <HI>God graunt that I may as ea∣sily

<HI>Thankes be to God that the Kings maiestie hath but one foole

<P>When hee was Lorde Chauncellour, hee inioyned a

saide: <HI>Then I doe hope your Lordeship will give mee a

<P>When hee had no lust to growe greatly vpward in the
worlde, neyther would labour for office of authoritie, and
over that, forsake a right worshipfull roome when it was
offered him, his wife fell in hand with him, and asked him;
What will you do that you list not to put foorth your selfe
as others doe? Will you sit still by the fire, and make gose∣lings
in the ashes with a sticke, as children doe? Woulde
God I were a man, and looke what I would doe. What?
By God goe forward with the best; for as my mother was
wont to say, It is ever more better to rule than to be ruled,
and therefore I warrant you, I would not be so foolish to
be ruled, where I might rule. <HI>By my trueth wife</HI> (quoth
he) <HI>I dare say you say trueth, for I never found you willing to
be ruled yet.</HI></P>
<P>He vsed, when hee was Lord Chauncellor, vpon every
Sonday, when he was at home, to sitte in the Quire in his
surplice and sing the Service: and being one day espied in
that attire by the Duke of <HI>Norffolke.</HI> The Duke beganne
to chafe, crying, Fie, fie, my Lorde, the Lord Chauncel∣lour
of England a parish priest, and a paltrie singing man,
you dishonour the King, you dishonour the King. <HI>No my
Lord</HI> (quoth sir <HI>Thomas) it is no shame for the King, if his

<P>During the time of his Chancellourship of England, he
vsed to send his Gentleman-Vsher to his wifes pew, after
divine service was done, to tell her that he was gone: but
the next Sonday after hee gave vp his Chancellourship of
England, he came himselfe to her pew, and vsed the vsuall
words of his Gentleman-Vsher, <HI>Madame, my Lorde is

<P>His latter wife was a widdow, of whom <HI>Erasmus</HI> wri∣teth,
that hee was wont to say, that shee was, <HI>nec bella, nec

voyde of the fault that often followeth that vertue, some∣what
shrewd to her servants: Vppon a time sir <HI>Thomas</HI>
found fault with her continuall ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding, saying; if that no∣thing
else would reclame her, yet the consideration of the

<P>One day when shee came from shrift, shee saide mer∣rily

<P>When he was sent prisoner vnto the Tower, and the
Lievtenant, his olde friend, received him with a heavy
cheere, hee sayde; <HI>Is this the entertainement and good coun∣tenance
you give your guests when they come to you? Why looke
man, heere are twenty angell nobles (shewing him his purse)
and when this is spent, turne me out at doores, as a bare game∣ster,

Tower, one of the Officers claimed for a fee, his vp∣per
garment, (meaning his gowne or his cloke) he offred
him his cappe.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="118"/>
Being asked after his condemnation, and before his ex∣ecution,
whether hee had changed his minde, hee saide:
<HI>Yea, for I thought to have beene shaven, but now seeing I shall
die so shortly, I will let my beard growe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>His daughter</HI> Roper <HI>one day as shee repaired vnto him
into the Tower, counselled him to recover the Kings fa∣vour,
and his owne former libertie, by doing I know not
what, the which shee saide one of the greatest States of
this Realme, and a man learned too, and his tender friend,
saide he might doe, without scruple of conscience, as most
of the Nobilitie of the Realme hadde doone, not once
sticking thereat, save onely himselfe, and one other man.
This speach of her hee aunswered with a pleasaunt tale.</HI>
At a Bartholomew faire at London, there was an Escheater of
the same city, that had arrested a Clothier that was outlawed,
and had seized his goodes, which he had brought into the faire,
tolling him out of the faire by a traine. The man that was ar∣rested
was a Northerne man, which by his friendes made the
Escheator to be arrested within the faire, vppon an Action I
not neere what, and called a Court of Pipowders. Now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad
the Clothier, by friendship of the Officers, found the meanes to
have all the Quest almost made of the Northerne men, such
as had their Boothes standing in the faire, who were no sooner
departed from the barre, and come into the house, but the
Northerne men were agreed, and in effect all the other, to cast
our London Escheater. They thought they needed no were to
proove that hee did wrong, than even the name of his bare of∣fice
alone. But then was there amongest them, as the Divell
woulde, an honest man of another quarter called <HI>Company.</HI>
And the fellow seemed but a seely soule, and sate still, and sayde
nothing; they made noreckoning of him, but saide. We be agreed
now, come, let vs goe and give vp our verdict. Then when the
poore fellow sawe that they made such hasle, and his minde no∣thing
gave him that way that theirs did (if that their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndes
gave them that way they saide,) hee prayed them to tarry and
talke vpon the matter, and tell such reason therein, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee
might thinke as they did, and when they should so doe, be would
<PB N="225" REF="118"/>
be glad to say with them; or else hee saide they must pardon
him: For sith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee had a soule of his owne to keepe, as they had,
be must say as he thought for his soule, as they must for theirs.
When they heard this they were halfe angry with him, What
good fellow, (quoth one of the Northerne men) whare wannes
thou? Be not we eleaven heere, and thou but one all alone, and
al we agreed, whereto shouldst thou sticke? Whates thy name
gud fellow? Maisters (quoth he) my name is called <HI>Company.
Company</HI> (quoth they) now by my troth good felow, play then
the gud companion, come thereon foorth with vs, and passe e∣ven
for gude company. Would God good maisters (quoth the
man againe) that there lay no more weight thereon. But now,
when we shall hence, and come before God, and that hee shall
send you vnto heaven for doing according vnto your conscience,
and me to the divell, for doing against mine, al passing at your
request heere for good company now, By God Maister <HI>Dic∣kenson</HI>
(that was one of the Northerne mens names,) If I
then shall say vnto you al againe; Maisters, I went once with
you for good company, which is the cause that I goe now to hell,
play you the good felowes now againe with mee, as I went then
for good company with you, so some of you go now for good com∣pany
with me: would you goe maister <HI>Dickenson?</HI> Nay, nay, by
our Lady, nor never a one of you all. And therefore must you
pardon me for passing as you passe; for the passage of my poore
soule passeth all good company.</P>
<P><HI>In the like sence he vsed often to say,</HI> That he would ne∣ver
pinne his soule at another mans backe, not even the best
man that he knew that day living; for he knew not whither he
might hap to carry it.</P>
<P>When one came to him, to signifie that hee must pre∣pare
himselfe to die, for hee coulde not live, he called for
his vrinall, wherein when hee had made water, hee cast
it, and viewed it (as Physitions vse) at last hee saide so∣berly,
<HI>That hee saw nothing in that water, but that he might
live, if it pleased the King.</HI></P>
<P>When he was in prison, and his bookes and papers ta∣ken
from him, he did shutte his chamber windowes both
<PB N="226" REF="119"/>
day and night, saying; <HI>When the wares are gone, and the
tooles taken away, we must shut vp shop.</HI></P>
<P>When he went to death, a certaine woman offered him
a cuppe of wine, which he refusing, saide; <HI>Good woman,
Christ in his passion drunke gall, and no wine.</HI></P>
<P>When he was to mount the scaffold hee saide to one of
the Shiriffes men, <HI>I pray thee helpe mee vp, as for comming
downe I take no care.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When the hangman (according to his manner) desired
him to pardon him his death, hee answered,</HI> I doe forgive
thee with al my heart: but one thing I wil tel thee, thou w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t
never have honestie in cutting off my head, my necke is so short.</P>
<P>NOw we have done with sir <HI>Thomas Moore</HI> his owne
Apothegmes which have come to my handes, I will

<P><Q>A poore man found a priest over familiar with his wife,
and because he spake it abroad, and could not prove it, the
priest sued him before the Bishops Officiall for defamati∣on,
where the poore man in paine of cursing was com∣maunded,
that in his parish Church hee should vppon the
Sonday, at high Masse, stand vp, and say, <HI>Mouth thou
liest:</HI> Whereuppon for fulfilling of his penaunce, vp was
the poore soule set in a pew, that the people might won∣der
at him, and heare what hee sayde: and there all aloude
(when hee had rehearsed what hee had reported by the
priest) then hee sette his handes on his mouth, and sayde;
Mouth thou liest: And by and by thereupon, he sette his
handes vpon both his eyes, and sayde; <HI>But eyne</HI> (quoth

<PB N="227" REF="119"/>
had rather have Gods blessing to beleeve that I see not,
then to go so farre for it. I am well apaid (said sir <HI>Thomas</HI>)
thereof, for if you had rather beleeve, then take the paine
of a long pilgrimage, you will never be so stiffe in any opi∣nion,
that you will put your selfe in ieopardie for pertinacy,
and stubborne standing by your part. Nay Marie said the
Messenger, I warrant you that I will never be so madde,
to hold, till it waxe too hot, for I have such a fond fantasie
of mine owne, that I had rather shiver and shake for colde
in the Summer, then be burned in the mids of Winter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It happened that a yong Priest verie devoutly in a Pro∣cession,
bare a Candle before the Crosse for lying with a
Wench, and bare it light all the long way, wherein the
people tooke such spirituall pleasure and inward solace,
that they laughed apace. And one merrie Marchant sayd
vnto the Priests that followed him, <HI>Sic luceat lux vestra
coram hominibus, Thus let your light shine before the people.</HI>
But a lewde Priest in later time, being reproved of his loose
life, and told that he and other of the Clergie ought to bee

<P><Q>When a lustie gallant saw a Frier going barefoote in a
great frost and snowe, hee asked him why hee did take
such paine. Hee aunswered, that it was a verie little paine
if a man would remember hell: Yea Frier (quoth the
Gallant) but what and if there be no Hell? Then arte
thou a great foole: Yea Maister (quoth the Frier) but
what if there be hell, then is mastership much more foole.</Q></P>

Holde thy babble I bid thee, thou wife in the red hoode,
which when the huswife heard, she waxed as angrie, and
sodainly she started vp, and cried vnto the Frier againe
that all the Church rang thereon; Mary sir, I beshrew his

when he saw that they did set a glose vpon it for his praise,
of their owne making beside; then would he shortly say
vnto them, I pray thee good fellow, when thou faist grace,
never bring in <HI>Gloria patri,</HI> without a <HI>Sicut erat.</HI> Any act
that ever I did, if thou report it againe to mine honour,

and way was best to be taken, to vnderstand the
obscure places in Saint <HI>Paules</HI> Epistles: he answered him
he thought the best and shortest way was, to reade first
the latter parte of those Epistles, which dooth intreate of
Christian manners, and vnderstand it, and expresse it in
life and good manners; and then to go vnto the first part,
where the matters of faith are subtily and exactly handled,
saying; <HI>That God wil give his spirite of vnderstanding soonest
vnto those, that with al their whole hearts seeke to serve him.</HI></P>

<P>When a Nobleman of <HI>Rome</HI> tolde him, that hee did
trust that he should come to his pleasaunt gardines, which
hee had sumptuously made, yea thirtie yeeres after, and
wonder at the beauty of them. <HI>Poole</HI> answered, <HI>I hope I
have not deserved so ill of you, that you should wish me so long a
banishment from my heavenly country.</HI></P>
<P>While he was in the Low countries, and one day would
have gone vnto <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour, but hee could not
be admitted to his speach: but two dayes after the Bishop
of <HI>Arras</HI> was sent vnto him by the Emperour, to excuse
his long stay, and desire him to come vnto him: <HI>Poole</HI>
sayde, that hee had strange happe, <HI>That whereas be spake
daily vnto God for the Emperour, yet he was not admitted vn∣to
the Emperour, to talke with him about a matter belonging
to God.</HI></P>
<P>There was one that was very curious in keeping of his
beard, and it was reported that hee bestowed every mo∣neth
two duckats vpon the trimming of it. <HI>If it be so</HI> (said
<HI>Poole) his beard wil shortly be more woorth than his head.</HI></P>
<P><HI>After the death of</HI> Paulus Tertius <HI>when many Cardinals
came vnto him, and tolde him, that if hee liked of it, they
would make him Pope:</HI> He desired them to looke well to it,
that they were swayed by no passion of the minde, or did ought
for favour, and good-will, but referre all their cogitations wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lie
vnto the honour of God, and the profite of his Church; the
which only they all ought especially to have alwayes before their
eyes.</P>
<P><HI>When one of the Cardinalls of the adverse faction did
one day charge him with ambition, and saide that hee did
vntimely and over-hastily seeke the Popedome: He an∣swered
<PB N="233" REF="122"/>
gravely</HI> That he thought not the burthen of that great
office to be so light, but that he was of the minde, that it was ra∣ther
to be feared, than desired. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for them which vnderstood
not, and thought more basely of so great a place, hee lamented
their case, and was sory for them.</P>
<P><HI>When the Cardinall</HI> Farnesi, <HI>and diverse other of his
fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds came vnto him, at midnight, to make him Pope,
by adoration, he repelled them saying;</HI> He would not have
so weighty a matter tumultuously and rashly done, but v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aily
and orderly, that the night was no convenient time therefore,
that God loved the light more than darkenesse, wherefore they
should deferre it vntill the next day, and that then of it plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
God, it might very well be done. <HI>But this his pious modesty
lost him the Papacie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He vsed often to say,</HI> Those which would betake them vn∣to
the study of the holy Scriptures, (which was as though they
would goe into the inner and secret parte of the Temple) must
passe thorow a lowe and a narrow doore: For that no man can
attaine to the vnderstanding of the Scriptures, that is prowde
and puffed vp with the sharpenesse of his wit, or excellencie of
humane learning; but be that bringeth lowlinesse of minde, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tempt of himselfe, and yeeldes his vnderstanding (<HI>as the A∣postle
saith</HI>) captive vnto faith.</P>
<P><HI>Of this also did hee often admonish those that woulde
study the sacred Scriptures,</HI> That they should specially beware
that they never went to the reading of them with this intent and
minde, that they might dispute of them to shew their learning,
and by that knowledge to get them honors and riches: for both
purposes, were every contrary to this kind of studie. Wherevnto
ought to be adhibited, first fervent prayers▪ then a lowely mind,
and finally an heart voyde of all ambition and greedy desire.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F the dignity of Poetry much hath
beene said by the worthy Sir <HI>Philipp
Sidney,</HI> and by the Gentleman which
proued that Poets were the first <HI>Poli∣ticians,</HI>
the first <HI>Philosophers,</HI> the first
<HI>Historiographers.</HI> I will onely adde
out of <HI>Philo,</HI> that they were Gods
owne creatures, who in his Booke <HI>de Plantatione Noe,</HI> re∣porteth,
that when he had made the whole worlds masse;
he created Poets to celebrate and set out the Creator him∣selfe,
and all the creatures: you Poëts read the place and
you will like it. Howsoeuer it pleaseth the <HI>Italian</HI> to cen∣sure
vs, yet neither doth the Sunne so farre retire his charri∣ot
from our Climate, neither are there lesse fauourable a∣spects
betweene <HI>Mercurie, Iupiter,</HI> and the Moone, in our
inclination of heauen, if Poëts are <HI>Fato,</HI> as it pleased <HI>Socra∣tes,</HI>
neither are our Poets destitute of Arte prescribed by rea∣son,
and grounded vpon experience, but they are as preg∣nant
both in witty conceits and deuises, and also in imitati∣on,
as any of them. Yea and according to the argument ex∣cell
in granditie and grauity, in smoothnesse and proprie∣tie,
in quicknesse and briefnesse. So that for skill, varietie,
efficacie, and sweetnesse, the foure materiall points requi∣red
in a Poët, they can both teach and delight perfectly.</P>
<P>This would easily appeare if any lines were extant of
that worthy <HI>British</HI> Lady <HI>Claudia Rufina,</HI> so commended
by <HI>Martial,</HI> or of <HI>Gildas</HI> which <HI>Lilius Giraldus</HI> sawe in the
libraries of <HI>Italie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beda Eccl. hist. lib. 4. cap. 24.</NOTE> or of old <HI>Chedmon</HI> who by diuine inspi∣ration
about the yeare 680. became so diuine a Poët in our
English tongue, that with his sweete verses full of com∣punction,
he withdrew many from vice to vertue, and a re∣ligious
feare of God: or of our <HI>Claudius Clemens</HI> one of

clearely appeare to all that can iudge by many learned

<P>The Duke of <HI>Suffolke</HI> and his brother, sonnes of <HI>Charles Brandon,</HI> which died of the sweat at <HI>Bugden,</HI> were buried together with this.

<P>This man was not so godly, as he was impious (as it seemeth▪) who was buried in the night without any ceremony vnder the name of <HI>Menalcas,</HI> with this.
