<HEAD>A
Further Account
Of the Province of
PENNSYLVANIA
AND ITS
IMPROVEMENTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">For the Satisfaction of those that are Adventurers, and
enclined to be so.</HEAD>
<P>IT has, I know, been much expected from me, that I
should give some farther Narrative of those parts of
<HI>America,</HI> where I am chiefly interested, and have
lately been; having continued there above a Year
after my <HI>former Relation,</HI> and receiving since my
return, the freshest and fullest Advices of its <HI>Progress</HI>
and <HI>Improvement.</HI> But as the reason of my coming back, was a
<HI>Difference</HI> between the <HI>Lord Baltamore</HI> and my self, about the
<HI>Lands of Delaware,</HI> in consequence, reputed of mighty mo∣ment
to us, so I wav'd publishing any thing that might look
in favour of the Country or inviting to it, whilst it lay un∣der
the Discouragement and Disreputation of that Lord's claim
and pretences.</P>
<P>But since they are, after many fair and full hearings before
the <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Committee</HI> for <HI>Plantations</HI> justly and happily
<HI>Dismist,</HI> and the things agreed; and that the <HI>Letters</HI>
which daily press me from all Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, on the subject of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
are so many and voluminous, that to answer them se∣verally,
were a Task too heavy, and repeated to perform, I
have thought it most easie to the Enquirer, as well as my self,
to make this Account <HI>Publick,</HI> lest my silence, or a more pri∣vate
intimation of things, should disoblige the just inclinations
of any to <HI>America,</HI> and at a time too, when an extraordina∣ry
Providence seems to favour its Plantation, and open a
Door to <HI>Europeans</HI> to pass thither. That then which is my
part to do in this Advertisement is,</P>
<P>First, <HI>To Relate our Progress, especially since my last of the
Month called</HI> August 83.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Capacity of the Place for farther Improvement,
in order to Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Which Way those that are Adventurers; or incline to be
so, may imploy their Money to a fair and secure Profit;</HI> such as
shall equally encourage Poor and Rich, which cannot fail of Advancing the Country in consequence.</P>
<P>I. We have had about NINETY SAYL <HI>of Ships with</HI>
PASSENGERS since the beginning of 82. and not one
Vessel, designed to the <HI>Province,</HI> through Gods mercy, hi∣therto
miscarried.</P>
<P>The Estimate of the People may be thus made; <HI>Eighty</HI>
to each Ship, which comes to SEVEN THOUSAND
TWO-HUNDRED PERSONS: At least a <HI>Thousand</HI>
there before, with such as from other Places in our neigh∣bourhood
are since come to reside among us: And I presume
the <HI>Births</HI> at least equal to the <HI>Burials:</HI> For having made
our first Settlement high in the <HI>Freshes</HI> of the Rivers, we do
not finde our selves subject to those Seasonings that affect
some other Countries upon the same Coast.</P>
<P>The People are a <HI>Collection</HI> of divers Nations in <HI>Europe:</HI> As,
<HI>French, Dutch, Germans, Sweeds, Danes, Finns, Scotch' Irish,</HI> and
<PB N="3" REF="2"/>
<HI>English;</HI> and of the last equal to all the rest: And which is
admirable, not a Reflection on that Account: But as they
are of one kind, and in one Place, and under One Allegiance,
so they live like People of <HI>One County;</HI> which Civil Union has
had a considerable influence towards the prosperity of that
Place.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and our intended Metropolis, as I for∣merly
Writ, is two Miles long, and a Mile broad, and at each
end it lies <HI>thot</HI> mile, <HI>upon a Navigable River.</HI> The scituation
<HI>high</HI> and <HI>dry,</HI> yet replenished with <HI>running streams.</HI> Besides the
High-Street, that runs in the midle from River to River,
and is an <HI>hundred foot</HI> broad, it has Eight Streets more that
run the same course, the least of which is <HI>fifty foot</HI> in breath.
And besides Broad-Street, which crosseth the Town in the
middle, and is also an hundred foot wide, there are twenty
streets more, that run the same course, and are also fifty foot
broad. The names of those Streets are mostly taken from
the things that Spontaneously grow in the Country, <HI>As Vine-Street,
Mulbery-Street, Chesnut-Srteet, Wallnut-Street, Strawbery-Street,
Cranbery-Street, Plumb-Street, Hickery-Street, Pine-Street,
Oake-Street, Beach-Street, Ash-Street, Popler-Street, Sassafrax-Street,
and the like.</HI></P>
<P>III. I mentioned in my last Account, that from my Arival
in <HI>Eighty two,</HI> to the Date thereof, being ten Moneths, we had
got up <HI>Four-score</HI> Houses at our Town, and that some Villages
were setled about it. From that time to my coming away,
which was a Year within a few Weeks, the Town advanced
to <HI>Three hundred and fifty seven Houses;</HI> divers of them, large,
well built, with good Cellars, three stories, and some with
<HI>Belconies.</HI></P>
<P>IV. There is also a fair <HI>Key</HI> of about three hundred foot
square, Built by <HI>Samuel Carpenter,</HI> to which a Ship of <HI>five
hundred Tuns</HI> may lay her broade side: and others intend to
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
follow his example. We have also a Rope-walk made by
<HI>B. Wilcox,</HI> and cordage for shipping already spun at it.</P>
<P>V. There inhabits most sorts of useful Trades-men, As
<HI>Carpenters, Joyners, Bricklayers, Masons, Plasterers, Plumers,
Smiths, Glasiers, Taylers, Shoemakers, Butchers, Bakers, Brewers,
Glovers, Tanners, Felmongers, Wheelrights, Millrights, Shiprights,
Boatrights, Ropemakers, Saylmakers Blockmakers, Turners</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>VI. There are <HI>Two Markets</HI> every Week and <HI>Two Fairs</HI>
every Year. In other places Markets also, as at <HI>Chester</HI> and
<HI>New-Castle.</HI></P>
<P>VII. Seven <HI>Ordinaries</HI> for the Intertainment of <HI>Strangers</HI>
and <HI>Work-Men,</HI> that are not House-keepers, and a good Meal
to be had for sixpence, sterl.</P>
<P>VIII. The hours for Work and Meals to <HI>Labourers,</HI> are
fixt, and known by Ring of <HI>Bell.</HI></P>
<P>IX. After nine at Night, the <HI>Officers</HI> go the Rounds and
no Person, without very good cause, suffered to be at any
Publick-House that is not a Lodger.</P>
<P>X. Tho this <HI>Town</HI> seemed at first, contrived for the
Purchasers of the <HI>first hundred shares,</HI> each share consisting of
5000 <HI>Acres,</HI> yet few going, and that their absence might not
Check the Improvement of the Place, and <HI>Strangers,</HI> that flockt
to us, be thereby Excluded, I added that half of the Town,
which lies on the <HI>Skulkill,</HI> that we might have Room for pre∣sent
and after Commers, that were not of that number, and it
hath already had great success to the Improvement of the
Place.</P>
<P>XI. Some <HI>Vessels</HI> have been here Built, and many <HI>Boats;</HI>
and by that means, a ready Conveniency for Passage of People
and Goods.</P>
<P>XII. Divers <HI>Brickerys</HI> going on, many Cellars already
Ston'd or Brick'd, and some Brick Houses going up.</P>
<P>XIII. The <HI>Town</HI> is well furnish'd with convenient <HI>Mills;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
and what with their <HI>Garden Plats,</HI> (the least half an Acre) the
<HI>Fish</HI> of the River, and their labour, to the <HI>Country-man,</HI> who be∣gins
to pay with the provisions of his own growth, they live
Comfortably.</P>
<P>XIV. The Improvement of the place is best measur'd, by
the <HI>advance</HI> of Value upon every mans Lot. I will venture
to say, that the worst Lot in the Town, without any Improve∣ment
upon it, is worth <HI>four times</HI> more then it was when it
was lay'd out, and the best <HI>forty.</HI> And though it seems un∣equal
that the Absent should be thus benefited by the Improv∣ments
of those that are upon the place, especially, when they
have serv'd no Office, run no hazard, nor as yet defray'd any
Publick charge, yet this advantage does certainly redound to
them, and whoever they are, they are great Debtors to the
Country; of which I shall now speak more at large.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Country Settlements.</HEAD>
<P>1. WE do settle in the way of <HI>Townships</HI> or <HI>Villages,</HI>
each of which contains 5000 Acres in square and
at least <HI>Ten Families:</HI> The regulation of the Country, being a
Family to each five hundred Acres: Some Townships have
more, where the Interest of the People is less then that quan∣tity;
which often falls out.</P>
<P>2. Many that had right to more Land, were at first cove∣tous
to have their <HI>whole</HI> quantity, without regard to this way
of settlement, tho by such <HI>Wilderness</HI> vacancies they had ruin'd
the Country, and their own interest of course. I had in my
view, <HI>Society, Assistance, Easy Commerce, Instruction of Youth,
Goverment of Peoples manners, Conveniency of Religious Assem∣bling,
Encouragement of Mechanicks, distinct and beaten Roads,</HI>
and it has answer'd in all those respects, <HI>I</HI> think, to an
Universall Content.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P>3. Our <HI>Townships</HI> lie square: generally the Village in the
Center; the Houses either opposit, or else opposit to the mid∣dle,
betwixt two houses over the way, for nearer neighborhood.
We have another Method, that tho the Village be in the Cen∣ter,
yet after a different manner: Five hundred Acres are allotted
for the Village, which among ten families comes to fifty Acres
each: This lies square, and on the outside of the square stand
the Houses, with their fifty Acres running back, whose ends
meeting, make the Center of the 500. Acres, as they are to
the whole. Before the Doors of those Houses, lies the high
way, and cross it, every mans 450 Acres of Land, that makes
up his Complement of 500 so that the Conveniency of Neigh∣bourhood
is made agreeable with that of the Land.</P>
<P>4. I said nothing in my last of any number of Townships,
but there were at least <HI>FIFTY</HI> settled before my leaving
those parts, which was in the moneth call'd <HI>August</HI> 1684.</P>
<P>5. I visitted many of them, and found them much advanc'd
in their Improvements. <HI>Houses</HI> over their heads, and <HI>Garden-Plots,
Coverts</HI> for their Cattle, an <HI>encrease</HI> of stock, and se∣veral
Enclosures in Corn, especially, the first Commers; and I
may say of some Poor men, even to the beginings of an Estate:
The difference of labouring for themselves and for others; of
an Inheritance, and a Rack Lease, <HI>being never better understood.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of The Produce of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>1. THe <HI>EARTH,</HI> by Gods blessing, has more then
answer'd our expectation; the poorest places in
our Judgment, producing large Crops of Garden Stuff, and
Grain. And though our Ground has not generally the sym∣ptoms
of the fat Necks, that lie upon salt Waters in Provinces
southern of us, our Grain is thought to <HI>excell</HI> and our Crops to
be as large. We have had the mark of the good Ground
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
amongst us; from <HI>Thirty to Sixty fold</HI> of English Corn.</P>
<P>2. The Land requires less seed: <HI>Three Pecks</HI> of Wheat
sow an Acre; a Bushel at most, and some have had the in∣crease
I have mention'd.</P>
<P>3. Upon Tryal, we find that the Corn and Roots that
grow in <HI>England,</HI> thrive very well there, as <HI>Wheat, Barly,
Rye, Oats, Buck-Wheat, Pease, Beans, Cabbages, Turnips, Carrets,
Parsnups, Colleflowers, Asparagus, Onions, Charlots, Garlick,
and Irish Potatos;</HI> we have also the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and very good
<HI>RICE</HI> which do not grow here.</P>
<P>4. Our <HI>Low</HI> Lands are excellent for <HI>Rape</HI> and <HI>Hemp</HI> and
<HI>Flax.</HI> A Tryal has been made, and of the two last, there is a
Considerable quantity Dress'd Yearly.</P>
<P>5. The <HI>Weeds</HI> of our Woods feed our Cattle to the Mar∣ket
as well as Dary: I have seen fat Bullocks brought thence to
Market before <HI>Mid-Summer.</HI> Our Swamps or Marshes yeeld
us course Hay for the Winter,</P>
<P>6. English <HI>GRASS-SEED takes well;</HI> which will give us
fatting Hay in time. Of this <HI>I</HI> made an Experiment in my
own Court Yard, upon sand, that was dug out of my Cellar,
with seed that had layn in a <HI>Cask,</HI> open to the weather two
Winters and a Summer: I caus'd it to be sown in the beginning
of the month called <HI>April,</HI> and a fortnight before <HI>Midsummer</HI>
it was fit to <HI>Mow:</HI> It grew very thick: But I ordered it to be
fed, being in the nature of a Grass Plott, on purpose to see if
the Roots lay firm: And though it had been meer sand,
cast out of the Cellar, but a Year before, the seed took such
Root, and held the earth so fast, and fastened it self so well
in the Earth, that it held and fed like old English Ground.
I mention this, to confute the Objections that lie against those
Parts, as if that, first, English Grass would not grow; next,
not enough to mow; and lastly, not firm enough to feed, from
the Levity of the Mould.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P>7. All sorts of English fruits that have been tryed, <HI>take
mighty well</HI> for the time: The <HI>Peach</HI> Excellent, on standers,
and in great quantities: They sun-dry them, and lay them
up in lofts, as we do roots here, and stew them with Meat
in Winter time. <HI>Musmellons</HI> and <HI>Water Mellons</HI> are raised there,
with as little care as Pumpkins in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>VINE</HI> espe∣cially,
prevails, which grows every where; and upon expe∣rience,
of some <HI>French People from Rochel, and the Isle of Rhee,
GOOD WINE</HI> may be made there, especially, when the
Earth and Stem are fin'd and civiliz'd by culture. We hope
that good skill in our most Southern Parts will yeild us seve∣ral
of the <HI>Straights</HI> Commodities, efpecially, <HI>Oyle, Dates,
Figgs, Almonds, Raisins</HI> and <HI>Currans.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Produce of our Waters.</HEAD>
<P>1. MIghty WHALES roll upon the Coast, near the
Mouth of the Bay of <HI>Delaware.</HI> Eleven caught, and
workt into Oyl one Season: We justly hope a considerable
profit by a Whalery. They being so numerous and the Shore
so suitable.</P>
<P>2. STURGEON play continually in our Rivers in
Summer: And though the way of cureing them be not gene∣rally
known, yet by a Receipt I had of one <HI>Collins,</HI> that related
to the Company of the Royal Fishery, I did so well preserve
some, that I had of them good there three months of the Sum∣mer,
and brought some of the same so for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>3. ALLOES, as they call them in <HI>France,</HI> the Jews <HI>Allice,</HI> and
our Ignorants, <HI>Shads,</HI> are excellent Fish, and of the Bigness of
our largest <HI>Carp:</HI> They are so Plentiful, that Captain <HI>Smyth</HI>'s
Overseer, at the <HI>Skulkil,</HI> drew 600 and odd at one Draught,
300 is no wonder, 100 familierly. They are excellent Pickled
or Smokt'd, as well as boyld fresh: They are caught by nets
only.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<P>4. ROCKS are somewhat rounder and larger, also a
whiter fish, little inferior in rellish to our <HI>Mallet:</HI> We have
them almost in the like plenty. These are often <HI>Barrell'd like
Cod,</HI> and not much inferior for their spending. Of both these
the Inhabitants increase their Winter store: These are caught
by Nets, Hooks and Speers.</P>
<P>5. The SHEEPSHEAD, so called, from the resem∣blance
of its Mouth and Nose to a Sheep, is a fish much pre∣ferr'd
by some, but they keep in salt Water; they are like a <HI>Roach</HI>
in fashion, but as thick as a <HI>Salmon,</HI> not so long. We have
also the <HI>Drum,</HI> a large and noble fish, commended equal to the
<HI>Sheepshead,</HI> not unlike to a <HI>Newfoundland Cod,</HI> but larger of
the two: Tis so call'd from a noise it makes in its Belly,
when it is taken, resembling a <HI>Drum.</HI> There are three sorts
of them, the <HI>Black, Red</HI> and <HI>Gold colour;</HI> the Black is fat in the
Spring, the Red in the Fall, and the Gold colour believed to be
the Black, grown old, because it is observ'd that young ones of
that colour have not been taken. They generally ketch them
by <HI>Hook</HI> and <HI>Line,</HI> as <HI>Cod</HI> are, and they save like it, where the
People are skilful. There are abundance of lesser fish to be
caught of pleasure, but they quit not cost, as those I have
mentioned, neither in Magnitude nor Number, except the
<HI>Herring,</HI> which swarm in such shoales, that it is hardly Cre∣dible;
in little Creeks, they almost shovel them up in their tubs.
There is the <HI>Catfish,</HI> or <HI>Flathead, Lampry, Eale, Trout, Perch
black</HI> and <HI>white, Smelt, Sunfish,</HI> &amp;c. Also <HI>Oysters, Cockles,
Cunks, Crabs, Mussles, Mannanoses.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Provision in General</HEAD>
<P>1. IT has been often said, we were starv'd for want of food;
some were apt to suggest their fears, others to insinuate
their prejudices, and when this was contradicted, and they
<PB N="10" REF="6" MS="y"/>
assur'd we had plenty, both of <HI>Bread, Fish</HI> and <HI>Flesh;</HI> then 'twas
objected, we were forc't to fetch it from other places at great
Charges: but neither is all this true, tho all the World will
think we must either carry Provision with us, or get it of the
Neighbourhood till we had gotten Houses over our heads,
and a little Land in tillage. We fetcht none, nor were we
wholly helpt by Neighbours; the <HI>Old Inhabitants</HI> supplied us
with most of the <HI>Corn</HI> we wanted, and a good share of <HI>Pork</HI>
and <HI>Beef:</HI> tis true, <HI>New-York, New-England</HI> and <HI>Road-Ifland,</HI>
did with their provisions fetch our Goods and Money, but at
such Rates, that some sold for almost what they gave, and
others carried their provisions back, expecting a <HI>better</HI> Mar∣ket
neerer, which showed no scarcity, and that we were not
totally destitute in our own River. But if my advice be of
any Value, I would have them buy still, and not weaken
their Herds, by killing up their Young Stock <HI>too soon.</HI></P>
<P>2. But the right measure of information must be the pro∣portion
of Value of Provisions there; to what they are in
more planted and mature Colonies. <HI>Beef</HI> is commonly sold
at the rate of <HI>two pence per Pound;</HI> and <HI>Pork</HI> for <HI>two pence half-penny;
Veal</HI> and <HI>Mutton</HI> at <HI>three pence,</HI> or <HI>three pence half penny,</HI>
that Country mony; an English Shilling going for <HI>fifteen pence.</HI>
Grain fells by the <HI>Bushel; Wheat</HI> at <HI>four shillings; Rye,</HI> and
excellent good, at <HI>three shillings; Barly two shillings six pence;
Indian Corn two shillings six pence, Oats two shillings,</HI> in that
money still, which in a new Country, where Grain is so much
wanted for seed, as well as food, cannot be called dear, and
especially if we consider the Consumption of the many new
Commers.</P>
<P>3. There is so great an encrease of Grain, by the dilligent
application of People to Husbandry, that within three Years,
some Plantations have got <HI>Twenty</HI> Acres in Corn, some <HI>Forty,</HI>
some <HI>Fifty.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>
<P>4. They are very careful to encrease their stock, and get
into <HI>Daries,</HI> as fast as they can. They already make good <HI>Butter</HI>
and <HI>Cheese.</HI> A good <HI>Cow</HI> and <HI>Calf</HI> by her side may be worth <HI>three
pounds</HI> sterling, in goods at first Cost. A pare of Working
<HI>Oxen, eight pounds:</HI> A pare of fat ones, <HI>Little</HI> more, and a plain
Breeding <HI>Mare</HI> about <HI>five pounds</HI> sterl.</P>
<P>5. For <HI>Fish,</HI> it is brought to the Door, both fresh and salt.
Six <HI>Alloes</HI> or <HI>Rocks</HI> for <HI>twelve pence,</HI> and salt fish, at <HI>three fardings</HI>
per <HI>pound, Oysters</HI> at 2 s. per <HI>bushel.</HI></P>
<P>6. Our DRINK has been <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Punch,</HI> made of <HI>Rum</HI>
and <HI>Water:</HI> Our Beer was mostly made of <HI>Molosses,</HI> which
well boyld, with <HI>Sassafras</HI> or <HI>Pine</HI> infused into it, makes very
tollerable drink; but now they make <HI>Mault,</HI> and Mault
Drink begins to be common, especially at <HI>Ordinaries,</HI> and the
Houses of the more substantial People. In our great Town
there is an <HI>able Man,</HI> that has set up a large <HI>Brew-House,</HI> in
order to furnish the People with good Drink, both there, and
up and down the River. Having faid this of the Country,
for the time I was there, I shall add one of the many Letters
that have come to my hand, because brief and full, and that
he is known to be a Person of an extraordinary Caution as
well as Truth, in what he is wont to Write or Speak.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Philadelphia <DATE>the 3d. of the 6th. month (August) 1685.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Governour.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving an opportunity by a Ship from this River, (out of which
<HI>several</HI> have gone this Year) I thought fit to give a short account
of proceedings, as to settlements here, and the Improvements
both in Town and Country. As to the Country the Improvements are <HI>large,</HI>
and settlements very <HI>throng,</HI> by way of TOWNSHIPS and VIL∣LAGES.
Great inclinations to Planting <HI>Orchards,</HI> which are easily
raised, and soon brought to perfection. Much <HI>Hay-Seed</HI> sown, and much
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>
Planting of <HI>Corn</HI> this Year, and great produce said to be, both of <HI>Wheat,
Rye</HI> and <HI>Rise; Barly</HI> and <HI>Oates</HI> prove very well, besides <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ian Corn</HI>
and <HI>Pease</HI> of several sorts; also <HI>Kidny-Beans,</HI> and <HI>English Pease</HI> of seve∣ral
kinds, I have had in my own Ground, with English Roots, <HI>Turnaps,
Parsnaps, Carrets, Onions, Leeks, Radishes</HI> and <HI>Cabbidges,</HI> with a∣bundance
of sorts of <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Flowers:</HI> I know but of few seeds that
have mist, except <HI>Rosemary</HI> seed, and being English might be old. Also,
I have such plenty of <HI>Pumpkins, Musmellons, Watermellons, Squashes,
Coshaws, Bucks-hens, Cowcumbers</HI> and <HI>Simnells</HI> of Divers kinds;
admired at by new Commers, that the Earth should so plentifully cast forth,
especially the first Years breaking up; and on that which is counted the
WORST SORT OF SANDY LAND. I am satisfied, and
many more, that the Earth is very fertil, and the Lord hath done his part,
if Man use but a moderate Diligence. <HI>Grapes, Mulberies, and many
wilde Fruits, and natural Plums,</HI> in abundance, this Year have I seen and
eat of. A brave <HI>Orchard</HI> and <HI>Nursery</HI> have I planted, and thrive mightily,
and Fruit the first Year. I endeavor choice of Fruits, and Seeds from
many parts; also <HI>Hay-Seed;</HI> and have sowed a field this spring for tryal.
First, I burn'd the leaves, then had it Grub'd, not the field, but the small
Roots up, then sowed great and small <HI>Clover,</HI> with a little <HI>old Grass-seed,</HI>
and had it only raked over, not Plowed nor Harrowed, and it grows
exceedingly: also for experience I sowed some patches of the same sort in my
Garden and Dunged some, and that grows worst. I have planted the Irish
<HI>Potatoes,</HI> and hope to have a brave increase to Transplant next Year. <HI>Cap∣tain
Rapel</HI> (the French man) saith, he made good WINE of the
<HI>Grapes</HI> (of the Country) last Year, and Transported some, but intends
to make more this Year. Also a French man in this <HI>Town</HI> intends the
same, for <HI>Grapes</HI> are very Plentiful.</P>
<P>Now as to the Town of PHILADELPHIA it goeth on in Plant∣ing
and Building to <HI>admiration,</HI> both in the front &amp; backward, and there are
about 600 Houses in 3 years time. And since I built my <HI>Brick House,</HI> the
foundation of which was laid at thy going, which I did design after a good
manner, to incourage others, and that from building with Wood; it being the
first, many take example, and some that built Wooden Houses, are sorry for
it: Brick building is said to be <HI>as cheap:</HI> Bricks are exceeding good,
and better then when I built: More Makers fallen in, and <HI>Bricks cheaper,</HI>
they were before at 16 <HI>s.</HI> English per 1000, and now many <HI>brave Brick
Houses are going up,</HI> with good Cellars. <HI>Arthur Cook</HI> is building him
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
a brave Brick House near <HI>William Frampton's,</HI> on the front: For
<HI>William Frampton</HI> hath since built <HI>a good Brick house, by his Brew-house
and Bake-house,</HI> and let the other for an Ordinary. <HI>John Whee∣ler,</HI>
from <HI>New-England,</HI> is building <HI>a good Brick house,</HI> by the <HI>Blew
Anchor;</HI> and the two Brickmakers <HI>a Double Brick</HI> House and Cellars;
besides several others going on: <HI>Samuel Carpenter</HI> has built <HI>another</HI> house
by his. I am Building <HI>another Brick</HI> house by mine, which is three large
Stories high, besides a good large Brick Cellar under it, of two Bricks and
a half thickness in the wall, and the next story half under Ground, the Cel∣ler
hath an Arched Door for a <HI>Vault</HI> to go (under the Street) to the River,
and so to bring in goods, or deliver out. <HI>Humphery Murry,</HI> from <HI>New-York,</HI>
has built a large Timber house, with Brick Chimnies. <HI>John Test</HI> has almost
finished a <HI>good Brick</HI> House, and a Bake-house of Timber; and <HI>N. Allen</HI>
a good house, next to <HI>Thomas Wynns</HI> front Lot. <HI>John Day</HI> a good house,
after the <HI>London</HI> fashion, most Brick, with a large frame of Wood, in the
front, for shop Windows; all these have <HI>Belconies. Thomas Smith</HI>
and <HI>Daniel Pege</HI> are Partners, and set to making of <HI>Brick</HI> this Year, and
they are very good; also, <HI>Pastorus,</HI> the <HI>German</HI> Friend, Agent for the
<HI>Company at Frankford,</HI> with his <HI>Dutch</HI> People, are preparing to <HI>make
Brick</HI> next year. <HI>Samuel Carpenter,</HI> is our <HI>Lime burner</HI> on his Wharf.
<HI>Brave</HI> LIME STONE found here, as the Workmen say, being proved.
We build most Houses with <HI>Belconies. Lots are much desir'd in the Town,
great buying one of another.</HI> We are now laying the foundation of a <HI>large
plain Brick house,</HI> for a Meeting House, in the Center, (sixty foot long, and
about forty foot broad) and hope to have it soon up, many hearts and hands
at work that will do it. A large Meeting House, 50 foot long, and 38 foot
broad, also going up, on the front of the River, for an evening Meeting, the
work going on a pace. Many Towns People setling their liberty Lands. I hope the
<HI>Society</HI> will rub off the Reproaches some have cast upon them. We now begin
to gather in some thing of our many great Debts.</P>
<P>I do understand three COMPANIES FOR WHALE
CATCHING are designed to fish in the Rivers Mouth this season, and
find through the great <HI>Plenty</HI> of fish, they may begin early. A Fisherman
this Year found the way to catch <HI>Whiteins</HI> in this River, and it's expected
many sorts of fish more then hath been yet caught, may be taken by the skilful.
Fish are in such plenty, that many sorts on tryal, have been taken with Nets,
in the Winter time: The <HI>Sweeds</HI> laughing at the <HI>English</HI> for going to try,
have since tried themselves. The River so <HI>big,</HI> and <HI>full</HI> of several sorts of
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
<HI>brave</HI> fish, that its believed, except frozen over, we may catch any time in
the Winter. It's great pity, but two or three experienced <HI>Fishermen</HI> were
here to Ply this River, to <HI>salt</HI> and <HI>serve fresh to the Town.</HI> A good way
to <HI>Pickle Sturgion</HI> is wanting; such abundance in this River, even before
the <HI>Town:</HI> many are Catcht, Boyld and Eaten. Last Winter <HI>great
plenty of Dear</HI> brought in by the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English</HI> from the Country.
We are generally very Well and Healthy here, but abundance Dead in
<HI>Maryland</HI> this Summer.</P>
<P>The Manufacture of <HI>Linnen</HI> by the <HI>Germans</HI> goes on finely, and they make
<HI>fine Linnen: Samuel Carpenter</HI> having been lately there, declares, they
had gathered one <HI>Crop of Flax,</HI> and had sowed for the <HI>Second,</HI> and saw it
come up well: And they say, might have had forwarder and better, had they
had <HI>old seed,</HI> and not stayed so long for the Growth of the <HI>new seed to sow
again.</HI> I may believe it, for large hath my experience been this Years,
though in a small peece of Ground, to the admiration of many.</P>
<P>I thought fit to signify thus much, knowing thou wouldst be glad to hear of
the People and Provinces welfare; the Lord preserve us all, and make way
for thy return, which is much desired, not only by our Friends, but all sorts.</P>

<HEAD>Of Further Improvements for Trade and Commerce.</HEAD>
<P>THose things that we have in prospect for Staples of

Oyle;</HI> to say nothing of our <HI>Provisions</HI> for the Islands,
our <HI>Saw-Mills, Sturgeon,</HI> some <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and our <HI>Furs</HI> and <HI>Skins,</HI>
which of themselves are not contemptible; I might add <HI>Iron</HI>
(perhaps <HI>Copper</HI> too) for there is much <HI>Mine;</HI> and it will be
granted us, that we want no Wood, though I must confess,
I cannot tell how to help preferring a domestick or self sub∣sistance,
to a life of much profit, by the extream Toyl of for∣raign
Traffick.</P>

<HEAD>Advice to Adventurers how to imploy their Estates,
with fair profit.</HEAD>
<P>IT is fit now, that I give some Advertisement to <HI>Adven∣turers,</HI>
which way they may lay out their Money to best
advantage, so as it may yeild them fair returns, and with
content to all concerned, which is the last part of my present
task; and I must needs say so much wanting, that it has
perhaps given some occasion to ignorance and prejudice to
run without mercy, measure or distinction against <HI>America,</HI> of
which <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to be sure has had its share.</P>
<P>1. It is agreed on all hands, that the <HI>Poor</HI> are the <HI>Hands</HI> and
<HI>Feet</HI> of the Rich. It is their labour that improves Countries;
and to encourage them, is to promote the real benefit of the
publick. Now as there are abundance of these people in many
parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> extreamly desirous of going to <HI>America;</HI> so
the way of helping them thither, or when there, and the return
thereof to the Disbursers, will prove what I say to be true.</P>
<P>2. There are two sorts, such as are able to transport them∣selves
and Families, but have nothing to begin with there;
and those that want so much as to transport themselves and
Families thither.</P>
<P>3. The first of these may be entertained in this manner.
Say I have 5000 Acres, I will settle <HI>Ten Families</HI> upon them,
in way of Village, and build each an house, an out-house for
Cattle, furnish every Family with Stock; as four <HI>Cows,</HI> two
<HI>Sows,</HI> a couple of <HI>Mares,</HI> and a yoke of <HI>Oxen,</HI> with a Town
<HI>Horse, Bull</HI> and <HI>Boar;</HI> I find them with Tools, and give
each their first Ground-seed. They shall continue <HI>Seven</HI>
Year, or more, as we agree, at <HI>half encrease,</HI> being bound to
leave the Houses in repair, and a <HI>Garden</HI> and <HI>Orchard,</HI> I pay∣ing
for the Trees &amp; at least <HI>twenty Acres</HI> of Land within <HI>Fence,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>
and <HI>improved</HI> to corn and grass; the charge will come to about
<HI>sixty</HI> pounds English for each Family: At the seven years end,
the Improvement will be worth, as things go now, 120 l. be∣sides
the value of the <HI>encrease</HI> of the Stock, which may be
neer as much more, allowing for casualties; especially, if the
People are honest and careful, or a man be upon the spot him∣self,
or have an Overseer sometimes to inspect them. The charge
in the whole is 832 l. And the value of stock and improve∣ments
2400 l. I think I have been modest in my computation.
These <HI>Farms</HI> are afterwards fit for <HI>Leases</HI> at <HI>full</HI> rent, or how else
the Owner shall please to dispose of them. Also the People
will by this time be skilled in the Country, and well pro∣vided
to settle themselves with stock upon their own Land.</P>
<P>4. The other sort of <HI>poor people</HI> may be very beneficially
transported upon these terms: Say I have 5000 <HI>Acres</HI> I should
settle as before, I will give to each Family 100 <HI>Acres,</HI> which in
the whole makes 1000; and to each Family <HI>thirty pounds</HI>
English, half in hand, and half there, which in the whole comes
to 300 l. After four years are expired, in which time they may
be easie, and in a good condition, they shall each of them pay
<HI>five pounds, and so yearly for ever, as a Fee-farm rent;</HI> which in
the whole comes to 50 l. a Year. Thus a man that buys 5000.
<HI>Acres</HI> may secure and settle his 4000 by the gift of one, and in
a way that hazard and interest allowed for, amounts to at least
ten <HI>per cent.</HI> upon Land security, besides the value it puts upon
the rest of the 5000 <HI>Acres.</HI> I propose that there be at least <HI>two
working hands</HI> besides the <HI>wife,</HI> whether son or servant; and
that they oblige what they carry; and for further security
bind themselves as servants for some time, that they will
settle the said land accordingly, and when they are once seated,
their inprovements <HI>security</HI> enough for the Rent.</P>
<P>5. There is yet another expedient, and that is, give to <HI>ten
Families 1000 Acres</HI> forever, at a <HI>small acknowledgement,</HI> and
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>
settle them in way of Village, as afore; by their seating thus,
the Land taken up is secured from others, because the <HI>method</HI>
of the Country is answered, and the value such a settlement
gives to the rest reserved, is not inconsiderable; I mean, the
40<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Acres; especially that which is <HI>Contiguous:</HI> For their
<HI>Children</HI> when grown up, and Handicrafts will soon cover to
fix next them, and such after settlements to begin at an
<HI>Improved Rent in Fee, or for long Leases or small Acknowledgements,
and good Improvements,</HI> must advance the whole considerably.
I conceive any of these methods to issue in a sufficient advan∣tage
to Adventurers, and they all give good encouragement
to feeble and poor Families.</P>
<P>6. That which is most adviseable for People, intended thi∣ther,
to carry with them, is in short, all things relating to
<HI>Apparel, Building, Housholdstuf, Husbandry, Fowling,</HI> and
<HI>Fishing.</HI> Some <HI>Spice, Spirits</HI> and <HI>double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear,</HI> at first, were not
amiss: But I advise all to proportion their Estates thus; one
third in <HI>Money,</HI> and two thirds in <HI>Goods.</HI> Upon <HI>peices of eight,</HI>
there will be almost a third gotten, for they go at 6 s. and by
goods well bought, at least <HI>fifty</HI> pounds sterl. for every hundred
pounds; so that a man worth 400 l. here, is worth 600 l. there,
without sweating.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Natives.</HEAD>
<P>1. BEcause many Stories have been prejudicially propa∣gated,
as if we were upon ill terms with the <HI>Natives,</HI>
and sometimes, like <HI>Jobs Kindred,</HI> all cut off but the Messenger
that brought the Tidings; I think it requisit to say thus much,
that as there never was any such Messenger, so the dead Peo∣ple
were <HI>alive,</HI> at our last advices; so far are we from <HI>ill</HI> terms
with the <HI>Natives,</HI> that we have liv'd in great friendship. I have
made seven Purchasses, and in Pay and Presents they have
<PB N="18" REF="10"/>
received at least <HI>twelve hundred pounds</HI> of me. Our humanity
has obliged them so far, that they generally leave their guns
at home, when they come to our settlements; they offer us no
affront, not so much as to one of our <HI>Dogs;</HI> and if an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them
break our Laws, they submit to be punisht by them: and
to this they have tyed themselves by an obligation <HI>under their
hands.</HI> We leave not the least indignity to them unrebukt, nor
wrong unsatisfied. Justice gains and aws them. They have
some Great Men amongst them, I mean, for Wisdom, Truth
and Justice. I refer, to my former Account about their
<HI>Laws, Manners</HI> and <HI>Religious Rites.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Goverment.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Goverment</HI> is according to the words of the <HI>Grant,</HI>
as near to the English as conveniently may be: In the
whole, we aim at <HI>Duty</HI> to the King, the Preservation of <HI>Right</HI>
to all, the suppression of <HI>Vice,</HI> and encouragement of <HI>Vertue,</HI> and
<HI>Arts;</HI> with <HI>Libert</HI> to all People to worship Almighty God,
according to their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Perswasion.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Seasons of Going, and usual time of Passage.</HEAD>
<P>1. THO Ships go hence at all times of the Year, it must
be acknowledged, that to go so as to arrive at <HI>Spring</HI>
or <HI>Fall,</HI> is best. For the Summer may be of the hottest, for
fresh Commers; and in the Winter, the wind that prevails, is
the North West, and that blows off the Coast, so that sometimes
it is difficult to enter the <HI>Capes.</HI></P>
<P>2. I propose therefore, that Ships go hence about the middle
of the moneths call'd <HI>February</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> which, allowing
two moneths for passage, reaches time enough to plant in
the <HI>Spring</HI> such things as are carried hence to plant, and in the
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>
<HI>Fall</HI> to get a small Cottage, and clear some Land against the
next <HI>Spring.</HI> I have made a discovery of about a hundred
Miles West, and find those back Lands richer in Soyl, Woods
and Fountains, then that by <HI>Delaware;</HI> especially upon the
<HI>SASQVEHANAH River.</HI></P>
<P>3. I must confess I prefer the <HI>Fall</HI> to come thither, as belie∣ving
it is more healthy to be followed with Winter then Sum∣mer;
tho, through the <HI>great goodness and mercy of God,</HI> we
have had an extrordinary portion of health, for so new and
numerous a Colony, notwithstanding we have not been so
regular in time.</P>
<P>4. The <HI>Passage</HI> is not to be set by any man; for Ships will
be quicker and slower. Some have been <HI>four</HI> moneths, and
some but <HI>one,</HI> and as often. Generally between <HI>six and nine
weeks.</HI> One year, of four and twenty Sayl, I think, there was
not three above nine, and there was one or two under six
weeks in passage.</P>
<P>5. To render it more healthy, it is good to keep as much
upon <HI>Deck</HI> as may be; for the <HI>Air</HI> helps against the offensive
smells of a <HI>Crowd,</HI> and a <HI>close place.</HI> Also to <HI>scrape</HI> often the
Cabbins, under the Beds; and either carry store of <HI>Rue</HI> and
<HI>Wormwood,</HI> some <HI>Rosemary,</HI> or often sprinkle <HI>Vineger</HI> about
the Cabbin. <HI>Pitch</HI> burnt, is not amiss sometimes against faint∣ness
and infectious scents. I speak my experience for their
benefit and direction that may need it.</P>
<P>And because some has urged my coming back, as an argu∣ment
against the place, and the probability of its improve∣ment;
Adding, that I would for that reason never return: I
think fit to say, That <HI>Next Summer,</HI> God willing, I intend to
go back, and carry my Family, and the best part of my Perso∣nal
Estate with me. And this I do, not only of Duty, but
Inclination and Choice. God will Bless and Prosper poor
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<PB N="20" REF="11" MS="y"/>
<P>I shall conclude with this further <HI>Notice,</HI> that to the end
such as are willing to embrace any of the foregoing propositi∣ons
for the <HI>Improvement of Adventurers Estates,</HI> may not be
discouraged, from an inability to find such <HI>Land-Lords, Ten∣nants,
Masters</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> if they intimate their desires to
my Friend and Agent <HI>Philip Ford,</HI> living in <HI>Bow-Lane</HI> in
<HI>London,</HI> they may in all probability be well accommodated;
few of any quality or capacity, designed to the <HI>Province,</HI> that
do not inform him of their inclinations and condition.</P>
<P>Now for you that think of going thither, I have this to say,
by way of caution; if an <HI>hair</HI> of our heads falls not to the
ground, without the providence of God, Remember, <HI>your
removal</HI> is of greater moment. Wherefore have a due reve∣rence
and regard to his good Providence, as becomes a Peo∣ple
that profess a belief in <HI>Providence.</HI> Go clear in your selves,
and of all others. Be moderate in Expectation, count on La∣bour
before a Crop, and Cost before Gain, for such persons will
best endure difficulties, if they come, and bear the Success, as
well as find the Comfort that usually follow such considerate
undertakings.</P>
