<HEAD>To his highly honoured Friends, <HI>Richard Hambden Rowland Hunt Henry Ashhurst Philip Foley Esquires.</HI> (Sons-in-law to the Right Honourable <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Paget</HI>); And to their Pious and Vertuous Ladies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Worthy and much honoured,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF the Dedication of this poor Work unto you, may carry with it any intimation of the great Respect and Honour I have for you, I desire the world should understand the ground of it; which is not so much the emi∣nency of your Quality and outward Condi∣tion (though that also deserves its due value and regard) as your eminent Piety and Vertue, which renders you truly honourable, and at∣tracts the esteem of all good men. And truly I cannot but look upon it as a great testimony of the Divine favour to that <HI>Noble Family</HI> to which you are all so nearly related, and a great honour to it, That in an Age so corrupt and depraved as this is, there should be found in it
<PB REF="3"/> so many Persons more <HI>ennobled</HI> by their <HI>Virtue</HI> than their <HI>High Birth;</HI> and more <HI>great</HI> in <HI>Good∣ness</HI> and <HI>real Worth,</HI> than in <HI>Estate.</HI> May the Blessing of God Almighty ever rest on You and your Families, and make you still great Examples of all that is good and praise-worthy, in the places where you live; that when you shall have finished your course, and served your Ge∣neration here according to the will of God, and are entred into your everlasting Rest, your Names may be to the succeeding Age as a <HI>Per∣fume</HI> poured forth.</P>
<P>As for what concerns this Work, you may please to understand, That it is the fruit of some of my hours of leisure and retirement, of which I have had more of late years than ever I desired or expected. And surely <HI>tam otii quam negotii reddenda est ratio,</HI> as he said: We must give account to God of our times of leisure, as well as of those of publick and visible em∣ployment. For those several years last past, wherein I have been confined to privacy, I have addicted my self to the serious study of the Holy Scriptures, not finding any way wherein I could better employ my time. For where can we find that profit, that delight, that comfort in afflictions, which may be reaped from a diligent perusal and serious meditation on those Sacred and Divinely-inspir'd Writings? I have often thought with my self, that a short and plain Analytical Paraphrase and Exposi∣tion of them, might be of great use to those
<PB REF="3"/> who have not leisure to read larger Comments. And accordingly I have bent my pains to serve them therein, as I was able. If my poor endea∣vours may be any ways serviceable to the Church of God, I shall rejoyce. However, as our blessed Saviour said in excuse of <HI>Mary</HI> when she was blamed for pouring her Box of precious Ointment on his Head (<HI>Mar.</HI> 14.4, &amp;c.), <HI>Let her alone, she hath done what she could;</HI> intimating, that if she had known how to ex∣press her high veneration and affection to Him in a better manner, she would have willingly done it: So I hope I may in some measure of sincerity and uprightness say, that <HI>I have done what I could.</HI> If I had known how to do any thing better for the service of God and His Church, in the Circumstances wherein I have of late years been cast, I hope I should have readily done it. But seeing I did not, I have (humbly imploring the Divine Assistance) ad∣ventured on this.</P>
<P>'Tis well known, that there is nothing in this world more pleasing and cheering to the eyes, than <HI>Light;</HI> insomuch that one elegantly calls it <HI>The smile of Nature.</HI> And in like manner, to the Mind and Understanding of man, there is nothing more pleasing and delightful than a clear discovery of <HI>Truth.</HI> But of all Truths, there are none can be so acceptable, so delight∣ful and ravishing, as <HI>those glorious Truths</HI> revealed by God in his holy Word, which tend so much to the bettering of <HI>man</HI> here, and to the bring∣ing
<PB REF="4"/> of him to eternal happiness hereafter. And truly I am very confident, would Persons of Quality and Education more diligently read and study the Holy Scriptures, they would find such incomparable delight, sweetness, and comfort in them, that <HI>Play-books</HI> and <HI>Romances,</HI> and such corrupting and effeminating Trash (which consume the precious hours of too many of our Gentry) would seem vile and contemptible in their eyes. But I need not say these things to you, who know how better to employ your time, and have learned to prefer <HI>Manna</HI> before Onions and Garlick.</P>
<P>All that I shall further trouble you with, is only to acquaint you, That se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ventu∣ring this poor thing of mine into a World so full of Censure and Prejudice, I find my self inclin'd to put up some such Petition unto God for it, as that excellent person, Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> put up for his Divine Poems:</P>
<Q><L>Turn their eyes hither who will make again:</L>
<L>Theirs, who will hurt themselves or me, refrain.</L></Q>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving lately published the intire History of our <HI>Bles∣sed Lord and Saviour,</HI> from his Birth to his glorious <HI>Ascension</HI> to Heaven; it will not be, I hope, unaccep∣table to thee, if I here present thee with the History of the <HI>Church</HI> immediately succeeding; and give thee a Narrative of the <HI>Acts, Labours, Travels, Sermons, Discourses, Miracles, Suc∣cesses,</HI> and <HI>Sufferings</HI> of the Holy Apostles, as they are record∣ed by the Evangelist <HI>Luke</HI> in that Divine Book of his, call'd the <HI>Acts of the Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>And that my Design in this undertaking may the more clearly be discerned, be pleased to understand, that I have digested the whole Work into <HI>Seven Chapters.</HI></P>
<P>The FIRST CHAPTER contains the Acts of all the Apo∣stles <HI>joyntly,</HI> from our Saviour's Ascension to <HI>Saul</HI>'s <HI>Conversion;</HI> and shews what was done by them <HI>before</HI> the Feast of Pente∣cost, <HI>at</HI> the Feast, and <HI>after</HI> it. (1.) <HI>Before the Feast;</HI> it shews how they continued in joynt-devotion for ten days together at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in expectation of the great <HI>promised effusion</HI> of the Spirit; and during that time, called <HI>Matthias</HI> by lot to the Apostleship in the room of <HI>Judas [Acts</HI> chap. I.] 2. <HI>At the Feast;</HI> it shews how they received a <HI>plentiful effusion</HI> of the Spirit, and spake <HI>divers Tongues;</HI> at which some of the <HI>Jews</HI> mocking, <HI>Peter</HI> preached an excellent Sermon to them, which had such wonderful success, that by his own and the other A∣postles endeavours, about Three thousand were that day con∣verted to Christ [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. II.]. (3.) <HI>After the Feast;</HI> it relates how <HI>PETER</HI> going up to the Temple with <HI>John,</HI> he there
<PB REF="5"/> miraculously cured a <HI>Cripple.</HI> The people being filled with amazement and astonishment at this <HI>miracle, Peter</HI> informs them, That it was not wrought by any power of his own, but by the power of Jesus Christ. And from hence he takes occasion to preach Christ to them (Chap. III.). The <HI>Rulers</HI> of the Jews being offended at his Sermon (though a great number of the people were converted thereby), apprehend <HI>him</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> and bring them before the <HI>Council,</HI> who after examination dis∣miss them, yet with a charge not to preach any more in the Name of Jesus. The Church hereupon betake themselves to prayer, and receive a present and gracious answer from the Lord. Next it shews, how holy and gracious the conversation of this Infant Church was, who convers'd together with great concord and charity, the rich selling their goods for the su∣stentation of the poorer so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. IV.] <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es the fraud and hypocrisie of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dreadful punishment; as also the many wond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wrought by the Apostles, to the terror of some, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e con∣version of others; and their couragious persisting to preach Christ, notwithstanding they were persecuted, imprisoned, and beaten for it [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. V.].</P>
<P>In the next place it sets forth how the Apostles appointed Seven <HI>Deacons</HI> to take care of the poor, whereof <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> were the most eminent, whose particular acts are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia∣ted; as namely, <HI>Stephen</HI>'s disputing with some of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nagogue of the <HI>Libertines,</HI> who (not being able to <HI>resist the wisdom and spirit by which he spake</HI>) drew him before the <HI>Council,</HI> and and there falsly accused him [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. VI.]. <HI>Stephen</HI> in a long and grave Oration defends himself, and pleads his Cause; but they interrupt him, and fall upon him, and stone him [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. VII.].</P>
<P>Immediately after <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Martyrdom, a violent Persecution arose, which scattered the Disciples at <HI>Jerusalem. Philip</HI> here∣upon went and preached Christ at <HI>Samaria,</HI> and did many Miracles there, and baptized many; and among the rest, <HI>Simon Magus.</HI> The Apostles that were left at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> hearing of <HI>Philip</HI>'s good success at <HI>Samaria,</HI> send <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> thither to confirm those new Disciples, and to enlarge the Church. These two Apostles coming thither, they by <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>imposition of hands</HI> conferr the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost on the true believers there; which <HI>Simon Magus</HI> seeing he offered the Apostles money to enable him to confer the like gifts on whomsoever he pleased: for which impiety <HI>Peter</HI> sharply reproves him. Lastly, It sets forth how <HI>Philip</HI> was sent to instruct and baptize the Eunuch [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. VIII].</P>
<P>The SECOND CHAPTER contains more particularly the History of those two great Apostles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> though there is inserted also something concerning <HI>Barnabas</HI>'s journey to <HI>An∣tioch,</HI> and the Martyrdom of <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>Now concerning <HI>PAƲL,</HI> these things are here related: (1.) His
<PB REF="5"/> miraculous Conversion. (2.) His Vocation to the Apostleship. (3.) His Preaching Christ first in the Synagogues of <HI>Damascus,</HI> and then in <HI>Arabia</HI> for the space of three years. (4.) His re∣turn to <HI>Damascus</HI> and escaping the hands of the Jews that there conspired to kill him.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Peter,</HI> these things are recorded: (1.) The <HI>Mira∣cles</HI> he wrought, namely, his healing <HI>Aeneas</HI> of the Palsie at <HI>Lydda,</HI> and raising <HI>Tabitha</HI> from the dead at <HI>Joppa [Acts</HI> Chap. IX.] (2.) The <HI>Doctrine</HI> he preached to <HI>Cornelius</HI> (a <HI>Gentile</HI>) and his company, upon a particular vision and command from God; whereupon the Holy Ghost falleth on them, and they are baptized [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. X.]. This converse and communi∣on of his with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he vindicates to the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were scandaliz'd at it, by a narrative of the whole matter. Here also is inserted a narration, how the Gospel being spread into <HI>Phoenice, Cyprus,</HI> and <HI>Antioch,</HI> by those Disciples who were dispersed upon the fore-mentioned persecution, <HI>Barnabas</HI> was sent from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to confirm them. <HI>Barnabas</HI> being at <HI>Antioch,</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds for <HI>Paul</HI> to come to him thither; where they both stre∣nuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly preach Christ, and there the <HI>Disciples</HI> were first called <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stians [Acts</HI> Chap. XI.]. About this time <HI>Herod</HI> persecu∣ted the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tians at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and killed <HI>James</HI> the brother of <HI>John.</HI> (3.) Here are related the <HI>sufferings</HI> which <HI>Peter</HI> un∣der-went under <HI>Herod,</HI> who imprisoned him with an intent to put him to death; but he was delivered by an Angel upon the prayers of the Church. Whereupon the anger of the King falls heavy upon his Keepers. <HI>Herod</HI> shortly after goes down to <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sarea;</HI> and in his pride taking to himself the Ho∣nour due to God, he is stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken by an Angel, and dyeth mise∣rably. After which, the Gospel prospereth [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. XII.]. This is the last we hear of this <HI>great Apostle</HI> (excepting his be∣ing present at the Council at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Act. 15.) till we come to his Epistles. As for <HI>Paul,</HI> the remainder of his story falls within the time and compass of his travels, and those Five re∣markable Journeys of his which are described in the Five en∣suing Chapters.</P>
<P>The THIRD CHAPTER contains a Narration of <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>First Journey</HI> from <HI>Antioch</HI> with <HI>Barnabas,</HI> to preach the Gospel to the <HI>Gentiles, John-Mark</HI> being their Minister: At which time they travelled to <HI>Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycaonia, Pisidia,</HI> and other Provinces of <HI>Asia</HI> the Less. And therefore this Journey we may call for distinction-sake, <HI>Iter Asiaticum;</HI> It is described <HI>Acts</HI> Chap. XIII, XIV.</P>
<P>The FOURTH CHAPTER contains <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Second Journey</HI> with <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and others, from <HI>Antioch</HI> to that fa∣mous <HI>Council</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which we may therefore call <HI>Iter Hierosolomitanum.</HI> It is described <HI>Acts</HI> Chap. XV. from ver. 1. to 36.</P>
<P>The FIFTH CHAPTER contains <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Third Journey,</HI> be∣ing accompanied with <HI>Silas</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> to visit and confirm the
<PB REF="6"/> Disciples in those Cities where <HI>He</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> had before preached the Gospel; which done, they were called by a Vi∣sion over into <HI>Macedonia,</HI> and so passed into <HI>Europe,</HI> and travel∣led to <HI>Philippi, Beroea, Thessalonica, Athens, Corinth,</HI> and so by <HI>Ephesus</HI> returned into <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea,</HI> and then came back a∣gain to <HI>Antioch.</HI> This Journey we may call <HI>Iter Graecum</HI> sive <HI>Macedonicum.</HI> It is described from <HI>ver.</HI> 36 of Chap. XV, to <HI>ver.</HI> 23 of Chap. XVIII.</P>
<P>The SIXTH CHAPTER contains <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Fourth Journey,</HI> which he began from <HI>Antioch</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> from whence he went to <HI>Ephesus,</HI> according to his promise, and staying the <HI>greatest part</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his time in that City, we may from thence call it <HI>Iter Ephesinum.</HI> From thence he went to visit the <HI>Europaean Chur∣ches;</HI> and at last from <HI>Macedonia,</HI> through <HI>Asia the Less,</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> he returned into <HI>Judea,</HI> where by the <HI>Jews</HI> he was ac∣cused, and by the Roman <HI>Officers</HI> taken into custody. Which Journey is described from <HI>ver.</HI> 23 of Chap. XVIII, to Chap. XXVII</P>
<P>The SEVENTH CHAPTER contains <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Fifth</HI> and <HI>Last Journey</HI> from <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sarea</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> which we may therefore call <HI>Iter Romanum,</HI> It is described <HI>Acts</HI> Chap. XXVII, and XXVIII.</P>
<P>In <HI>these Seven Chapters</HI> I have comprised the Divine History of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles.</HI> Possibly some may now ask How it can be properly so called, seeing it chiefly relates the story of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul;</HI> and of the <HI>former</HI> but sparingly, and insists principally upon the Acts of the <HI>later,</HI> mentioning but little what the other Apostles <HI>did,</HI> or what Churches they <HI>planted,</HI> or what <HI>death</HI> they died. For answer to which, this is all that can be said, That it seemed good to the Spirit of God to have only <HI>so much</HI> written as he saw conducing to our edification; and in that we are to acquiesce. Besides, <HI>Luke</HI> who wrote the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> was a disciple and follower of <HI>Paul,</HI> and his Companion in most of his Travels; and therefore no won∣der if he designed principally to write <HI>his Story.</HI> To all which we may add, That as <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Conversion</HI> was more miraculous than the conversion of any other of the Apostles, so the course of his Ministry was more illustrious. <HI>He laboured more abun∣dantly than they all,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.10. <HI>Hierom</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Catal. script. Ecclesiastic. Tom. 1.</NOTE> thinks, <HI>Luke</HI> wrote this History at <HI>Rome</HI> in the <HI>second</HI> year of <HI>Paul</HI>'s imprisonment there, and at the request of the Brethren in that City, and by the direction of <HI>Paul</HI> himself; but principally, by the peculiar guidance of the Holy Ghost. He is thought to have written it in the 62 year of Christ, and the 6th of <HI>Nero.</HI> We have there∣fore in this Divine Book set before us, an History of the <HI>rise, growth, state, and practice of the primitive Church, in the purest Apostolical times;</HI> and a declaration of the <HI>pure doctrine then de∣livered, and of the pure Worship and Church-Government and Dis∣cipline then practised.</HI> All which may be a pattern to succeeding Churches in all ages.

<P>Thus <HI>(Courteous Reader)</HI> I have given thee a brief view or pro∣spect of this whole History; for a better understanding of which, I have added a Map of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>'s Trayels.

<P>About 23 years after this dismal Destruction, in the 14 year of <HI>Domi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian, John the Evangelist</HI> had the <HI>Revelation</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Patmos.</HI> And this is all I thought fit to advertise thee of by way of Preface. Only I shall add, If thou desirest to reap any benefit by my Paraphrase on the Epistles, I entreat thee to take thy Bible, and to read the Text along with the Paraphrase. It is not un∣known to any who have ever attentively read over the Apostoli∣cal Epistles, that there are abundance of <HI>dark and obscure passages in them;</HI> abundance of <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>things hard to be understood,</HI> as the Apostle speaks, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.16. I may truly say, I have not wil∣lingly or knowingly passed over any of them untouch'd, but said something (according to my poor Talent) either in the Paraphrase, or in the Notes, tending to the clearing of them. And so heartily praying and desiring that from the whole, God may receive glory, and the ingenuous <HI>Reader</HI> benefit, I bid thee farewell.</P>

<P>WE have perused, as our occasions w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld permit, the Book you brought us, call'd <HI>The Apostolical History,</HI> containing an <HI>Analytical Paraphrase</HI> on the whole Book of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> and <HI>all the Apostolical Epi∣stles,</HI> which are in number Twenty one. And seeing you desire our opinion upon it, we declare, That we judg it a Work which (with the blessing of God) will be exceeding useful and beneficial to seve∣ral sorts of persons: Particularly,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> To such Ministers as are not furnished with good Libraries.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> To young Scholars who should be directed in Chronologie, and how to reduce the passages and transactions of the Apostolick Times, to their due and proper places, and should be guided in a right way and method of studying the holy Scriptures.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> To Masters of Families, that they may thereby be enabled to instruct their Families.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> To private Christians in the daily reading of the Scriptures, who have not time or leisure to read larger Comments.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5</HI> 'Tis a Book sit for Parents to give to their Children that are grown up, to bring them to a love and delight in the Scriptures, they being made plain, and facile, and intelligible in this Para∣phrase.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> The Notes in the Margin are very useful for Scholars to give them an account of the particular interpretations that the Au∣thor giveth of sundry difficult places; and yet they are so ordered, that they will not disturb the <HI>unlearned</HI> in reading either the Apo∣stolical History, or the Paraphrase on the Epistles.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> The Map of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Travels is useful and delightful, not only for the clearer understanding how <HI>that blessed Apostle</HI> planted the Gospel up and down in the world; but it may be useful also for the understanding of several passages in the History both of the Old and New Testament.</P>
<PB REF="8"/>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> The History of the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> may give much light to many passages not only in the Apostolical Epistles, but in the Gospels also.</P>
<P><HI>And therefore we commend this Reverend Author's design of helping us to know the Scriptures, to the blessing of Him who inspired those that wrote them. And this we do the more</HI> hopefully, <HI>because it hath been the observation of the most</HI> pi∣ously considerate, <HI>That God hath in all Ages made those La∣bours of his Servants most eminently acceptable, which have been employed in the profitable explication of any part of the Scripture; as if He, who hath imprinted such a</HI> Majesty <HI>upon the Text, delighted also to reflect an honour upon the Inter∣preters thereof; and to make mens Works</HI> illustrious, <HI>by their</HI> illustrating <HI>the Word of God, and directing others in the paths that lead to blessedness.</HI></P>

Thirdly, he speaks <HI>of his Resurrection</HI> how God <HI>raised him again,</HI> loosing the bands of death, it being impossible as <HI>David</HI> had praedicted, that he should be holden of it. For though those words, <HI>Psal</HI> 16.8. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a <HI>lower sense</HI> had reference to <HI>Davids</HI> person, yet they were more fully, and ultimately to be fulfilled in the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>David, The eternal word</HI> of God, The <HI>Messias</HI> of the world; and that not only because <HI>David</HI> was a Type of him, and did represent his Person, but also because he was now in <HI>his loins,</HI> according to the flesh. As these words therefore refer to <HI>David</HI> they may be thus Paraphrased; <HI>I have set the Lord always before me,</HI> i. e. I have set my thoughts continually on God, as being ever present with me; and because <HI>he is at my right hand</HI> ever ready to assist and support me, <HI>I shall not be moved,</HI> that is, not swallowed up of my sorrows nor removed from my constant obedience to his will.

The Papists would from this place conclude, that the Soul of Christ imme∣diately upon his Death did locally des∣cend into Hell the place of the damned. But without any ground. For the words speak evidently of a deliverance from a paenal condition, whereas the Papists themselves hold that Christs Soul was triumphant in Hell. And the Apostle in this place plainly proves, that <HI>David</HI> was <HI>left in that Hell</HI> from whence Christ was raised so that it is clear he understood the words of Christs rising from the Grave: as the second clause doth more plainly express, <HI>Thou wilt not suffer thine holy One to see corruption.</HI> The Scope of the Apostle therefore in citing thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place is not to deal about the deliverance of Christs Soul out of Hell, but punctually of Christs resurrection; and the resurrection is properly of the body, not of the soul. The true meaning and sense therefore of the Article of <HI>Christs descent into Hell</HI> (as the <HI>Latines</HI> im∣properly translate <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) seems to be this, <HI>He went into the place of</HI> invisible Souls. For his body remained in the Grave, and his Soul passed to Paradise. And thus the Articles go on methodically without any Tautology. That after Christs death his body was buried in the Grave, his Soul went to the place o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blessed Souls, and the third day both Soul and bo∣dy were re united in his Resurrection, See Dr. <HI>Richardsons</HI> notes on <HI>Psalm.</HI> 16.</NOTE> <HI>in Hell,</HI> that is, my dead body in the grave; nor suffer me utterly to perish in the Pit of corruption so as never to rise again. <HI>Thou wilt shew me the path of life,</HI> that is, how I shall after my resurrection live for ever in thy glory, <HI>Thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance,</HI> that is, In thy presence I shall have fulness of joy forevermore. But these words in their proper and literal sense could not be spoken of <HI>David,</HI> because <HI>David</HI>'s body was left in the grave and was there corrupted [See <HI>Act.</HI> 13.36.37. compar'd with 1 <HI>King.</HI> 2.10.] and therefore they must needs have refe∣rence to Christ, who (as <HI>David</HI> saw by the Spirit of Prophecy) was to spring from his Loins. (See 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7. and <HI>Psal.</HI> 132.) and so by the same Spirit he saw also that he was soon to <HI>rise again from the dead,</HI> as the <HI>head</HI> of his mystical Body, and by virtue of <HI>his resurrection,</HI> his members were to rise also.
<PB N="10" REF="15"/> And that God had assuredly according to <HI>David</HI>'s Prophecy raised this Jesus from the dead, <HI>Peter</HI> declares that he and his fellows could, and did bear their Testimony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">from v. <HI>24.</HI> to <HI>33.</HI></NOTE>. Fourthly, he then speaks to them of his <HI>Ascension,</HI> and how after his <HI>resurrection</HI> he was exalted to the right hand of God: the consequent of which was, that having received authority and commission from the Father to prour forth his holy Spirit in a plentiful manner, [which he had often before spoken to them of, as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.26. and 15.26. and 16.13, 14.] he had now accordingly done it, and this strange thing of <HI>their speaking divers tongues,</HI> (which was so much wondred at by them) was an effect thereof.

For upon their <HI>believing</HI> in Christ, the pro∣mise made by God in the New Covenant of remission of sins [<HI>Jer.</HI> 31.34. <HI>Zech.</HI> 13.1.] appertained to <HI>them,</HI> and <HI>to their children</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Promissiones, quae ad Parentes fi∣deles pertinent etiam eorum liberis de∣bemus applicare, quamdiu facto contra∣rio &amp; propriâ infidelitate seipsos non ex∣cludunt. <HI>Streso.</HI></NOTE>, and to as many of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> and <HI>their Chil∣dren,</HI> as the Lord should effectually call to <HI>faith in his Son,</HI> and therefore they ought to receive <HI>Baptism</HI> the <HI>Seal</HI> thereof.

'Tis probable, whilst <HI>Peter</HI> preached thus to the Jews of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in the <HI>Syriack</HI> tongue others of the Apostles spake at the same time, and to the same purpose * to several there present of other nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Lightfoot in loc.</HI> p. 47. 48</NOTE> and the success of their preaching was that Three thousand were that day

<P>The Council much marvelled at this boldness, and freedom of speech, wherewith the Apostles expressed themselves, seeing their education had been such as could not raise them above mean and ordinary men. But then they were told, or else some of them remembred, that they were such as had attended upon Je∣sus in his life time. However though they were convinced of the truth of the Miracle wrought by them, yet after they had debated upon the matter among themselves, they judged it fit strictly to prohibit them to preach any more in <HI>the name</HI> of Je∣sus; which injunction the Apostles would by no means yeild obedience unto, alledging that it was much more right and fit <HI>to obey God, than them;</HI> and declared, that they could not choose but proclaim for the benefit of others those truths concerning Christ of so high importance, which themselves had certain know∣ledg of, being eye and ear-witnesses of them.

<P><HI>v.</HI> 16. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Je∣rusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 17. Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him. (which is the sect of the Sadduces) and were filled with indignation.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 18. And laid their hands on the Apostles, and put them in the com∣mon prison.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 19. But the Angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 20. Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 21. And when they heard that, they entred into the temple early in the morning, and taught: but the high priest came, and they that were
<PB N="28" REF="24"/> with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 22. But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 26. Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence (For they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned)</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 27. And when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y had brought them, they set them before the coun∣cil, and the high priest asked them,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 28. Saying, Did not we straitly command you that you should not teach in this Name? And behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 29. Then Peter, and the other Apostles answered, and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 31. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Sa∣viour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 32. And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 33. When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took coun∣sel to slay them.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 34. Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel a doctor of law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the Apostles forth for a little space.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 35. And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to your selves, what ye intend to do as touching these men.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 36. For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be some∣body, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joyned them∣selves: who was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 37. After this man rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished, and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 38. And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 39. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 40. And to him they agreed: and when they had called the Apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the Name of Jesus and let them go.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 41. And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoycing that that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his Name.</P>

An argument of a clear consci∣ence, and of the divine assistance, and pre∣sence. Being permitted to speak for him∣self, he in a long and grave oration ap∣plyes himself to answer the charge that was brought against him. And because these his accusers, and others of the Jews (as it seems) imagined that God was so delighted and pleased with the Temple, and the Temple-Service, and the Mosaical, Rites that he in∣tended always to continue and perpetuate them, and that no other way of Worship could be acceptable to him; therefore by an historical deduction he shews them that God was worshipped aright before either Tabernacle or Temple was made, or any of the Mosaical Rites instituted or ordained, and therefore the true Worship of God was not necessarily, and inseparably annexed to any of these things. For the proof of this he begins at <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> and shews them how that he living of old at <HI>Ʋr</HI> of the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> in the midst of Idolaters [<HI>Josh.</HI> 24.2, 3.] God was pleased of his free mercy to manifest himself to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gen. 12.</NOTE> about the seventieth year of his age, and effectually to enlighten him by his grace, and savingly to draw him to own, and worship him the true God: and commanding him to leave his native Country, and go into a land which he would shew him, he promised to make of him a great nation, and that <HI>in him, all the families of the earth should be blessed. Abraham</HI> obeying this command, drew on his father <HI>Terah</HI> also with him; and so they came from <HI>Ʋr</HI> to <HI>Charran,</HI> where he served God till the death of his father, which was about five years after. His father being dead he was again called by God to leave that Country, and to go into <HI>Canaan,</HI> which accordingly he did, and there God promised <HI>that to his seed he would give that land,</HI> but they must first endure a long servitude in <HI>Egypt.</HI> Af∣ter he had a good while sojourned in <HI>Canaan,</HI> when he was Nine∣ty nine years old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gen. 17.</NOTE> God made a Covenant with him, and in∣stituted Circumcision as the Seal thereof, so that from his first Call from <HI>Ʋr,</HI> when he was seventy years of age to this time when he was Ninety nine, he had served God faithfully, yet without <HI>cir∣cumcision</HI> to this present time.

<P>The Children of Israel now growing, and encreasing to a vast multitude in Egypt, in tract of time, there arose a <HI>Pha∣raoh,</HI> that <HI>knew not Joseph,</HI> who fearing the number, and strength of the Israelites, exceedingly oppressed them; and to prevent their encreasing, made a barbarous Edict, that their male chil∣dren should be killed as soon as they were born, or else drowned in the river*. In the time of this Edict, <HI>Moses</HI> was born to <HI>Am∣ram</HI> and <HI>Jochebed</HI> his wife, who being a very lovely child, his Parents hid him three months in their house; but at last not da∣ring to conceal him any longer, they put him in a basket of Bul∣rushes, daubed over with flime and pitch, and laid it in the flags by the side of the River. Here the Kings Daughter finds him; and moved with compassion towards the Infant, nourisheth him up for her own son, putting him out to his own Mother to nurse: and caused him to be educated in all the <HI>learning</HI> of the <HI>Egypti∣ans,</HI> so that he proved a person of great abilities above other men, being very able both to give counsel, and to act any great affair. When he grew to the age of Forty, it came into his mind to visit his brethren the Israelites; and among other things that evidenced to him their sad condition, he saw an Egyptian smiting an Israelite, which so stirred up his spirit, that he slew the Egyptian who did the wrong, thereby giving the Israelites the first intimation, that God would deliver them by his hand, (which it seems God had by instinct, or revelation made known unto himself,) but they understood it not. The next day seeing two Israelites at variance, he would have made them friends, and set them <HI>at one</HI> again. But he, who did the wrong upbrai∣ded him for it, and said, <HI>Who made thee a ruler, and a judg over us? wilt thou kill me as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday? Moses</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="27"/> perceiving hereby, that what he had done to the Egyptian was known, and that the King hereupon would seek his life, he fled from thence into the land <HI>Midian,</HI> where he spent other Forty years of his life, and married <HI>Zippora, Jethro</HI>'s daughter, and by her had two Sons. The children of Israel continuing still under sore bondage in Egypt; it pleased the Lord now at length to com∣passionate them, and to resolve to deliver them. Wherefore, when <HI>Moses</HI> had been Forty years in <HI>Midian,</HI> as he was keeping his father-in-laws sheep about <HI>Horeb,</HI> or <HI>Sinai,</HI> the Angel of the Lord appeared to him out of a burning Bush, and called him to go to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> requiring him to deliver his people Israel. <HI>Moses</HI> after he had shewed many signs and wonders in <HI>Egypt</HI> at last brought them out. And leading them through the red Sea, he brought them into the wilderness to Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> where God gave them his law, and appointed <HI>Moses</HI> to make a Tabernacle for his worship according to the pattern he had shewed him in the Mount. So that to this day for above Four hundred years, he shews them, the Fathers had worshipped God without any Tabernacle at all.</P>
<P>He further shews them, that though <HI>Moses</HI> was a person high∣ly to be regarded, whose memory ought always to be precious to them, having had intimate converse with God, and having received the law from his mouth, yet they might remember to their humiliation how their impious Ancestors would not obey him; but contrary to his mind, during his absence in the Mount, made a golden Calf<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 39.

For the Apostles (who had an extraordinary Functi∣on, and therefore were bound to shew more than ordinary courage) remaining at <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> and sticking to their work there, till they should be more manifestly called by God from thence; the rest of the Disciples (of which there were now some thousands, as appears <HI>Act.</HI> 2.41. and <HI>ch.</HI> 4.4.) were scattered some into the Regions of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Samaria,</HI> who spread the Gospel wheresoever they came; some went to <HI>Da∣mascus,</HI> among whom was <HI>Ananias</HI> a devout and religious per∣son, <HI>Act.</HI> 9.10. &amp; 22.12. Others, it's like, went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and among them <HI>Andronicus</HI> and <HI>Junia,</HI> who were of note among the Apostles, and kinsmen of the Persecutor <HI>Saul,</HI> and had em∣braced the faith before him, as himself testifieth, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.7.

Among them that went to <HI>Samaria, Philip</HI> was one, (the second in order after <HI>Stephen</HI> among the seven Deacons). He coming into that City, preached Christ so effectually, that the people with one accord gave heed to the Doctrine he delivered, and seeing the Miracles<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Miracula solent comparari cum campanis, quibus homines convocantur ad verbum audiendum.</NOTE> wrought by him, they were perswaded to embrace the Gospel. For out of many that were possessed, he cast un∣clean Spirits who at their coming out, made loud acknowledg∣ments of the irresistableness of the power by which he acted. And others, that were taken with Palsies, or were lame he cu∣red.

<P>The imposition of the Apostles hands mentioned here and elsewhere, was not upon all that believed, and were baptized, but on some certain persons, whom they were directed by the Holy Ghost to lay hands upon, not for their confirmation in grace, but as those God intended to imploy in the propagating of his Gospel, See <HI>Lightf.</HI> in loc.</P></NOTE> of their hands upon certain persons among them, whom they were directed by the Holy Ghost to lay their hands upon (as those God had appointed to be prea∣chers, and ministers of the Gospel, and whom by these their gifts he would enable to understand the language and sense of the Scripture, and to be instructors of the peo∣ple) those miraculous powers were confer∣red on them. <HI>Simon Magus</HI> seeing this, and being touched with a secret Ambition to get this power of conferring these miracu∣lous gifts of the Holy Ghost upon whom∣soever he pleased, (which would have made him famous and renowned in the world) he offered the Apostles a sum of <HI>(c)</HI> money to inable him to do it. <HI>Peter</HI> inflam'd with an holy indignation at this wretched moti∣on, said unto him, <HI>Thy mony perish with thee.</HI> Assure thy self, <HI>No share, or portion of so glorious a priviledg as this is, belongs unto thee.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">From this deed of <HI>Simons,</HI> 'tis called <HI>Simony</HI> to seek to buy spiritual gifts or offices, with money or gifts.</NOTE> For I perceive thou art not upright before God, but thy <HI>hypocrisie</HI> and <HI>ambiti∣on,</HI> by which thy heart is as it were bound and fettered, is as odious to him as the bitterness of Gall can be to any mans taste.

<P>Whilst <HI>Peter</HI> was thus preaching to <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s family and those other persons there present, they were by the powerful work of the Spirit of God converted to Christ, and the holy Ghost by his wonderful Graces and Gifts, <HI>viz.</HI> of Illuminati∣on, Regeneration and the gift of Tongues descended on them all, of his own accord, without any laying on of hands by <HI>Pe∣ter,</HI> to the great wonder and astonishment of the believing <HI>Jews,</HI> that had accompanied the Apostle thither, who thought this Promise, of sending down the holy Ghost, belonged only to the House of <HI>Israel.</HI> Then <HI>Peter</HI> seeing what was done, and how these <HI>Gentiles</HI> had been baptized with the holy Ghost, concluded that they ought to be baptized with Water, and re∣ceive the external sign or seal of incorporation into Christs Bo∣dy, the Church; therefore commanding all things to be made ready, either He baptized them himself, or gave order that some of those who accompanied him (who probably were Mi∣nisters and Teachers), should do it.

<Q><P><HI>Act.</HI> 10. <HI>v.</HI> 1. There was a certain man in Cesarea, called Cornelius, a cen∣turion of the band, called the Italian band,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 2. A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 3. He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day, an an∣gel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 4. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 5. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose sirname is Peter.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 6. He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner whose house is by the sea-side; he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 7. And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius, was departed, he called two of his houshold servants, and a devout souldier of them that waited on him continually.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 8. And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 9. On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the house to pray, about the sixth hour.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 10. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 11: And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet, knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 12. Wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 13. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter: kill and eat.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 14. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 15. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed that call not thou common.</P>
<PB N="62" REF="41"/>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 16. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 17. Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen, should mean: behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius, had made enquiry for Simons house, and stood before the gate,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 18. And called, and asked whether Simon which was sirnamed Peter, were lodged there.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 19. While Peter thought on the vision, the spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 20. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 21. Then Peter went down to the men, which were sent unto him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 22. And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel, to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 23. Then called he them in, and lodged them: And on the morrow Pe∣ter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompa∣nied him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 24. And the morrow after they entred into Cesarea: and Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 25. And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 26. But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up, I my self also am a man.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 27. And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 28. And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation: but God hath shewed me, that I should not call any man com∣mon or unclean.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 29. Therefore came I unto you without gain-saying, assoon as I was sent for. I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was falling until this hour, and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 31. And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 32. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose sirname is Pe∣ter: he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner, by the sea-side, who when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 33. Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast well done, that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 34. Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 35. But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 36. The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (he is Lord of all).</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 37. That word (I say) you know which was published thorowout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached:</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 39. And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 40. Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 41. Not to all the people, but unto witnesses, chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 42. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testifie that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judg of quick and dead.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 45. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his Name who∣soever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 44. While Peter yet spake these words, the holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 45. And they of the circumcision which believed, were astonished, as many as came with Peter; because that on the Gentiles also was pow∣red out the gift of the holy Ghost.</P>

<P>THe Apostles and Brethren that were in <HI>Judea,</HI> namely Those that had been converted out of <HI>Judaism</HI> to Christ hearing of this, when <HI>Peter</HI> came shortly after to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> began to quarrel with him, that he had conversed with <HI>Ʋn∣circumcised</HI> persons, and eaten with them. But when he had declared unto them the whole matter (which he confirmed by the Testimony of those six persons that accompanied him to <HI>Caesarea</HI>), they were satisfied, and glorified God, who also has given unto the Gentiles <HI>repentance unto life,</HI> graciously chan∣ging their hearts, and drawing them to believe in Christ.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Act.</HI> 11. <HI>v.</HI> 1. And the Apostles, and brethren that were in Judea, heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 2. And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 3. Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 4. But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 5. I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from hea∣ven by four corners, and it came even to me.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 7. And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise Peter, slay and eat.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 8. But I said, Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entred into my mouth.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="42"/>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 9. But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath clean∣sed, that call not thou common.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 10. And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 11. And behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Cesarea unto me.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 12. And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. More∣over these six brethren accompanied me; and we entred into the mans house:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 13. And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose sirname is Peter:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 14. Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 15. And as I began to speak, the holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 16. Then remembred I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 17. Forasmuch then as God give them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ: what was I that I could with∣stand God?</P>

<P><HI>David</HI> was a man after <HI>Gods mind</HI> in the main of his life, though not in every particular action, the <HI>deno∣mination</HI> being from the greater part.</P></NOTE> what he enjoyn'd him in gover∣ning the people. Of this mans seed he shews, God according to his promise [<HI>Isa.</HI> 11.1.] had raised up to Israel, <HI>Jesus</HI> a Saviour. To whom <HI>John Baptist</HI> bare witness, preaching the Doctrine of Repentance and pressing con∣trition, humiliation, and brokenness of heart for sin, that so there might be stirr'd up in the people a hunger, and thirst, and earnest de∣sire after Christ, who was then ready to ap∣pear, and to enter on his prophetick office. He shewed that <HI>John</HI> did not only exhort to repentance in his Sermons, but by administring the ordinance of <HI>Baptism</HI> he obliged them to it, and to an humble acknowledgment and confession of their sinfulness and impurity, which <HI>washing with water</HI> might suggest unto
<PB N="77" REF="48"/> them. And as <HI>John</HI> went on fulfulling his ministry, he was so far from arrogating to himself the Title of the Messias, that he avowed himself only for his <HI>forerunner,</HI> declaring, that shortly the Messias would come in person and preach among them, which accordingly he did. Now this Gospel and Word of Salvati∣on, which Christ brought into the World (he shews) is sent, and is to be proclaimed and made known unto them. He ac∣knowledges the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> and people that then dwelt at <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> did not indeed understand him to be the <HI>Messias</HI> as they might have done, had they considered the Predictions of the Prophets, contained in those Sections and Portions of Scripture which every Sabbath-day are read in their Synagogues; but in∣stead thereof, they adjudged him to death, and in so doing, fulfilled those very prophesies they understood not. And though they found not in him any cause of death, yet they desired <HI>Pi∣late,</HI> that he might be slain. But after he was crucifi'd and bu∣ried, he shews them, that God raised him from the dead, and for Forty days he continued upon the earth, and was several times seen by his disciples and divers others who from the be∣ginning attended on him, who do now with great assurance testifie these things unto all the Jews. He further shews, that now God had actually fulfilled his promises made unto their fathers, in that he had sent <HI>his son</HI> into the world to be incarnate, and to accomplish the work of our redemption, whom he had rai∣sed from the dead, after he had been crucifi'd according to the promises and predictions that are recorded of him in sundry places of Scripture, as particularly in <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.7. where Christ is said in the day of his <HI>resurrection, to be be∣gotten</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><P>Deus Pater, ter dicitur Chri∣stum filium genuisse, &amp; ter vitam ei dedisse. 1.

<P>The Apostle having ended his Sermon, as they went out of the Synagogue, the <HI>Prose∣lytes</HI> (who were of <HI>Gentile</HI> parentage, but had embraced the Jewish religion, and though uncircumcised, frequented their religious as∣semblies) desired to hear more of this sub∣ject the next Sabbath. And some pious per∣sons of the Jews, together with these religi∣ous Proselytes, followed the Apostles to their Lodging, who exhorted them to continue stedfast in the doctrine of the Gospel. And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole City to hear the Gospel preached by them. But the <HI>chief</HI> men of the Jews, seeing how the people thronged to hear the Apostles, were horribly enraged at it, and contradicted, and cavilled at the doctrine they preached, and reviled and calum∣niated their persons. However, this nothing discouraged <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas;</HI> but putting off all fear, they openly declar'd, that they had performed their charge from Christ of preach∣ing the Gospel first to the Jews; but seeing they beha∣ved themselves so obstinately and perversly, and by their con∣tempt thereof shewed and declared themselves unworthy of so great a blessing, they were now by Gods appointment to leave them, and to preach to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> For this was the directi∣on of God, that the Gospel being first preached to the Jews, and rejected by them, it should then be preached to all other people of the world. And this is the sum of that old prophe∣sie, <HI>Isa.</HI> 49.6. <HI>I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles, to give
<PB N="79" REF="49"/> the people that sate in darkness knowledg of the way to eternal life.</HI> When the <HI>Gentiles</HI> heard this good news, and understood their own interest in it, they rejoyced exceedingly, and magnified, and highly approved the Gospel and word of the Lord, and as many as were chosen of God, and by the conviction of his Spi∣rit, prepar'd and dispos'd to seek after eternal life, <HI>believed.</HI> And the Gospel was preached over the whole Country. But the Jews being enraged hereat, stirred up and exasperated some of the <HI>female proselytes</HI> of honourable quality (who were led with a blind zeal against the Gospel, which they understood not, and accordingly, as it seems, stirred up their husbands against it), and other chief persons in the City against the Apostles, and drave them out of their Coasts; who shaking off the dust of their feet against them (as our Saviour had commanded, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.14.), departed and went to <HI>Iconium,</HI> a City of <HI>Lycaonia,</HI> in the lesser <HI>Asia.</HI> Yet the Disciples in this City, and the parts adjacent, were nothing discouraged with the Jews Blasphemies, calumnies, and oppositions, but were fill'd with spiritual Joy that they had embrac'd the Gospel, and went on couragiously in their profession of it.</P>

This bred great disturbance at present, and in time an <HI>Apostacy</HI> of very many from the Gospel. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> therefore (who had chiefly to deal in the ministration to the <HI>Gentiles</HI>) are now sent <HI>from Antioch</HI> to consult the <HI>Apostles at Jerusalem</HI> about this case. This is the journey that is spoken of, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.1. <HI>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jeru∣salem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me: and I went up by revelation,</HI> &amp;c. Not but that he was sent by the Church, but the Church was directed <HI>by a special revelation</HI> from God, (ei∣ther first signified to them, or else to <HI>Paul</HI> immediately, and by him made known to them) to take this course for the settling this Question.</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> being brought on their way and accom∣panied by some of the Brethren of <HI>Antioch</HI> (that it might ap∣pear they went not of their own accord, but as sent by that Church), they declared, as they passed along, to the Brethren, every where, for their comfort and confirmation, what great things God had done by their ministry, in the conversion of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> When they came to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> (being kindly re∣ceived by the Apostles, and Elders, and the Church there), They began to open their Message, acquainting them what suc∣cess God had given to their preaching among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and how wonderfully his Spirit had co-operated with them; Yet so it was, that some <HI>Judaizing</HI> Christians of the Sect of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> coming to <HI>Antioch</HI> had taught, that such <HI>Gentiles who embraced the faith,</HI> ought to receive Circumcision, and were ob∣liged to the observation of the Ceremonial Law. So that <HI>faith in Christ</HI> was not judged sufficient (by these men) to justifica∣tion, but according to them, <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and an observation of the Ceremonial Law must be joyned with it. These things they intimate had bred a difference among them: They were therefore come thither from the Church at <HI>Antioch</HI> to consult the Apostles in this case; and to desire their determination therein. Hereupon the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Elders</HI> of the Church at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> met <HI>in Council</HI> to consider of this matter<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 6. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] By a common Hebraism, <HI>word</HI> is put for the <HI>business spoken of.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>ABout this time <HI>Paul</HI> (who desired not only to plant Chur∣ches but also to water them) propounded to <HI>Barnabas,</HI> that they might go and visit the Churches which they had plan∣ted in several Countries, and see whether they did thrive and grow in the knowledg of Christ, and obedience to him, and ac∣cordingly might exhort, and confirm them.

<P>Whereupon she her self was forthwith baptized, and desiring to consecrate all within her Family to Christ, her whole hous∣hold was baptized also. Then to testifie her gratitude, she cour∣teously entertained <HI>Paul</HI> and his Companions in her house.</P>
<P>After this, as they went again toward the place of Prayer, a certain <HI>maid servant</HI> that was possessed with a Devil (who speaking from within her, revealed secret, and future things, and thereby gained much to her Masters) followed them, crying out, <HI>These are the servants of the most high God, who declare unto us the way of salvation. Paul</HI> not brooking that the truth should be thus rendred suspected by the Testi∣mony of the Father of Lyes, commanded the unclean Spirit, in the Name of Christ, to come out of her, and he came out immediately. The Masters of the Maid seeing their gain, which came in by her divination, now at an end, they drew <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> before the principal Rulers and Commanders of the Co∣lony there, telling them that these men being <HI>Jews,</HI> did much disquiet and disturb the City, teaching a religion contrary to theirs, and to the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, which permitted the practice of no Worship, but what was approved by the Senate of <HI>Rome.</HI> The multitude also being by this suggestion enraged against them, the Rulers commanded them to be stript, and beaten, and cast into prison; where they were harshly used by the <HI>Gaoler,</HI> being thrust into the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.

At this, his Spirit was much stirred within him, a holy indignation being kind∣led in his breast, to see their horrible Idola∣try and Superstition. He therefore sets himself to reform this great evil. And first, he applies himself to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>re∣ligious proselytes</HI> there, teaching Christ in their Synagogue. Then in the Market-place, and such places of publick concourse, he took occasion to make known the Doctrine of Christ to such as he met with there. And some of the <HI>Philosophers,</HI> of the Sect of the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> and <HI>Stoicks,</HI> encountred him and dis∣puted with him; and some of them derided and slighted him, calling him <HI>Babler:</HI> Others said, he was a <HI>publisher</HI> and <HI>setter forth of strange Gods,</HI> because he preached <HI>Jesus,</HI> and the <HI>resur∣rection.</HI> Hereupon they brought him to <HI>Areopagus,</HI> the place of Judicature in <HI>Athens,</HI> and examined him more strictly, what <HI>new religion</HI> it was he taught; the temper of that people being very inquisitive after new things.</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> being brought before the <HI>Judges</HI> in <HI>Areopagus</HI> spake to them, to this purpose, <Q REND="inline"><HI>Ye men of Athens, I look upon you, as those which are generally given to the worship of more</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Athenienses adeò superstitiosi erant ut putarent sibi colendum quic∣quid uspiam terrarum pro Deo co∣leretur &amp; quia timebant ne omnium populorum Dii sibi non essent cog∣niti, etiam incognitis altaria erige∣bant.</NOTE> <HI>gods or Daemons than other cities are.</HI> For as I passed up and down in your City, beholding your Altars and Images, I found an Altar with this Inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD: Whom ye profess to worship, and yet know not, him do I preach unto you, namely, The invisible God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, who cannot be con∣tained in any Shrine, or Temple of mans framing. Nor can any Image made by mans hands be a proper instrument to re∣present him; Neither does he need any of the Sacrifices, or Gifts that are offered to him by men, seeing he gives to all their very life, and all that they have. And of <HI>one man</HI> and <HI>woman, viz. Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> hath he made the whole race of mankind, and hath ordained their time, and place, when, and where, they shall dwell on the face of the earth: And the end of all this is, That they might seek after Him, that crea∣ted them, and worship him sincerely. And though they were lest through their fall, and degeneracy from Him, as in the
<PB N="108" REF="64"/> dark yet is this <HI>invisible God</HI> palpably to be discerned, and his glorious wisdom, power and goodness (manifest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in his works of Creation and Providence), distinctly, and clearly to be known, if men would but seek and grope after him. And indeed we need not go out of our selves to find him, for he is very near every one of us. For our <HI>life, motion,</HI> and <HI>subsistence</HI> is wholly by him, and by his power, according to that which <HI>Aratus</HI> (a <HI>Poet</HI> of your own who hath written of the course of the Heavens) once delivered, saying, <HI>We are also his offspring,</HI> that is, we are descended from God by Creation. God therefore being our <HI>Creator,</HI> can in no rea∣son be supposed to be the work of our hands, as an Image of Gold, or Silver, or Stone is: And how irrational is it for man, the Image of God, to adore an Image, or work made by his own hands, which falls so short of representing the infinite, and invisible God, that it cannot represent the Spirit and Soul, the Reason and Understanding of man. And though God in his infinite patience hath long born with the world, thus lying in ignorance, and going on in such prodigious conceits, yet now he causeth his Gospel to be preached to all Nations, and thereby calls and invites them to repentance, and to forsake their Idols and sinful ways, which they ought seriously and speedily to do, because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judg the world in righteousness by his Son Jesus Christ, of which he hath given assurance by raising him from the dead. [<HI>vid. Act.</HI> 10.42.]</Q></P>
<P>When <HI>Paul</HI> had mentioned the <HI>resurrection</HI> of the dead, some of those learned men (probably those of the Sect of the <HI>Epicureans</HI> who denyed all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uture life) fell a scoffing; but some others of them desired to hear him again concerning those matters. So for the pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt he left them, having performed his part in sowing the good seed of the Gospel among them. And though we read not of any great success <HI>Pauls</HI> ministry had in this famous University, yet it pleased God to incline the hearts of some in this place to believe, and embrace his Doctrine, and to adhere to him. Among whom were <HI>Dionysius</HI> (one of the <HI>Areopagites,</HI> or <HI>Senators</HI> and <HI>Judges</HI> in <HI>Areopagus</HI>), and a wo∣man call'd <HI>Damaris</HI> with some others.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 17. Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 18. Then certain Philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountred him: and some said, What will this babl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r say? Other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 22. Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars-hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 23. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an Altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 24. God that made the world, and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 25. Neither is worshipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 26. And hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 27. That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 28. For in him we live, and move, and have our being, as certain also of your own Poets have said, For we are also his off-spring.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 29. for as much then as we are the off-spring of God, we ought not to think that the God-head is like unto gold, or silver, or stone graven by art, and mans device.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 30. And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now command∣eth all men every where to repent:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 31. Because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judg the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 32. And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mock∣ed, and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 33. So Paul departed from among them.</P>

Having therefore so great sollicitude in his mind for them, he could not any longer forbear the sending of <HI>Timothy</HI> to them, to know the state of their faith, and to know whether they continued constant in it, or whether the Devil and the world bringing persecutions upon them on that account had not caused them to warp under those trials, and so rendred all his labours among them fruitless. But when <HI>Timothy</HI> return'd and brought him the welcom news of the firmness and constancy of their faith, and of the continuance of their charity, and of their kind remembrance of him, and great desire to see him, this, he tells them, was matter of exceeding great joy unto him; and the testimony he heard of their faith, did more comfort him, than all the afflictions which he suffer'd did deject him.

'Tis true, he wrote <HI>larger</HI> Epistles to some Churches, yet he never wrote <HI>with his own hand</HI> any so large as this. As for his <HI>Adversaries,</HI> he shews, they were not acted with sincere inten∣tions in urging <HI>Circumcision</HI> upon them, but with <HI>hypocrisie,</HI> or a desire only to make a <HI>fair outward shew of Religion,</HI> by observing that <HI>fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shly</HI> and <HI>carnal rite,</HI> and that they might escape pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cution from the <HI>Jews,</HI> (and from the Civil Powers, who were instigated by them, <HI>Act. 18.12, 13);</HI> which we, says he, that preach the sincere D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrine of the Gospel concerning Christ crucified are exposed unto. For the fury of those <HI>Persecutors</HI> was much abated towards <HI>such Chri∣stians</HI> as did observe the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> He further sheweth, that these <HI>false Apostles,</HI> that so vehemently urged Circumcision upon them, did not themselves, in other points, observe the <HI>Law,</HI> but <HI>dispensed</HI> with it among them∣selves where they knew there were none like to publish their doings abroad <HI>[Mat. 23.4.]:</HI> yet they urged <HI>Circumcision</HI> upon them, that they might be able to boast of the multitude of their Proselytes among them; and that so many received <HI>Cir∣cumcision</HI> in their flesh, at their instigation, and carried it as a mark of their in∣structi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. But as for <HI>himself,</HI> he shews them, the matter of his <HI>Gloriation</HI> was only the <HI>Cross of Christ,</HI> that is, that he had preached up the <HI>all-sufficient, expiatory,</HI> and <HI>satisfactory</HI> Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross. And for the sake of <HI>Christ crucified,</HI> all honour, favour, and respect with men was despised by him, as he for his zeal for Christ was despis'd, persecuted and cast off by the World, <HI>1 Cor. 4.12, 13.</HI> And the reason why he gloried in the <HI>Cross of Christ,</HI> and not in any <HI>fleshly priviledges,</HI> was, because in the <HI>Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Church</HI> of Christ neither <HI>Circumcision availeth any thing,</HI> nor <HI>Uncircumcision,</HI> without Regeneration and renewing of the Soul by the Holy Ghost. And to as many as walk <HI>according to this Rule</HI> (that is, this pattern of Doctrine which he had taught in this Epistle) concerning <HI>Mans Justification before God,</HI> concerning <HI>Christian Liberty,</HI> and a <HI>Christian Conversation,</HI> he heartily wishes <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>mercy,</HI> that is, all manner of <HI>spiritual Blessings;</HI> they being<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The particle, <HI>and,</HI> must in this place be <HI>exegetick</HI> of <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> thing, [as <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.3.]; and not <HI>copulative</HI> of divers.</NOTE> the <HI>true Israel</HI> of God.

For as the <HI>carnal Jews</HI> require some sign or prodigy from Heaven to be shewed them, to per∣swade them of the truth of the Gospel: So the <HI>Greeks</HI> look for profound <HI>Philo∣sophy</HI> in the Gospel, and scorn it because they think they find it not there. But we, says the Apostle, are nothing discouraged hereby, but go on in our course, prea∣ching <HI>Christ crucified;</HI> which Doctrine, is to the <HI>Jews</HI> (who looked for a victo∣rious <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssias,</HI> who should rescue them out of the power of their enemies) a <HI>stumbling block;</HI> and to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> (who are gratified with nothing but Eloquence and Phi∣losophy) <HI>meer foolishness.</HI> However, unto them that are <HI>effectually called</HI> both among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> this Doctrine is deservedly acknowledged to be the great evidence of the <HI>power</HI> of God, and the manifestation of the wisdom of God above all worldly wisdom. Neither ought this to seem strange, for the institutions of God (though they may seem weak and foolish to the World) are more efficacious and powerful then all the wisdom and power of wordly men. And as God in <HI>calling</HI> of men, (as they might observe), does not, for the most part, call the <HI>wise,</HI> and <HI>noble,</HI> and <HI>great,</HI> but <HI>meaner</HI> persons; so likewise he hath not made choice of the <HI>lofty strain</HI> of preaching to serve his glorious ends in converting sinners, but the <HI>plainer</HI> way. He hath chosen <HI>the way</HI> which the World will count <HI>foolish,</HI> on purpose that by the <HI>success</HI> of it, the wise men of the World may be put to shame, (being so much deceived in their expectation); and he hath chosen <HI>that way</HI> which the World counts <HI>weak,</HI> that he may make it appear, how much more power there is in it (when his blessings concurs with it), than in those ways they account most excellent and powerful: and lastly, he hath chosen <HI>such means</HI> for the bringing a∣bout his glorious ends, which to the men of the World seem despicable, and abject, that it may appear how empty all those things are which are so much valued in the World, when these which they so much despise, shall be manifested to be more effectu∣al than they. And this he does, that no man may have any reason to boast of his wis∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m before him; but may be forc'd to ascribe all glory to him. And he tells them, that it is of <HI>his working alone,</HI> that they are now <HI>in Christ Jesus,</HI> that they believe

<P>And by this means, he shews, they attributed more to their Teachers then was meet.

<P>He now uses another Argument against this <HI>Schism</HI> taken from the <HI>unity</HI> that ought to be among their Teachers; who in <HI>office, labour</HI> and <HI>teaching</HI> ought to be <HI>one,</HI> and therefore neither <HI>by them,</HI> nor <HI>for them,</HI> is the Church to be di∣vided.

<P>Another Argument which he uses to move them to take heed of bringing in any false Doctrines among them, is this: All, says he, that are brought effectu∣ally to believe in Christ, are the <HI>Temple of God,</HI> a Church of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in them.

For says he, I tell you, if any man among you seemeth to himself to be wise, according to the wisdom that acts the men of this world, his best way is to deny his own <HI>carnal wisdom,</HI> and submit himself to the wisdom of God, and the plain Doctrine of the Gospel, which the World accounts <HI>foolishness,</HI> and then he shall approve himself truly wise towards God, and in the matters that concern his Soul.

<P>He comes now in the last place, to mitigate his sharp reprehension of them, tel∣ling them, his intent therein was only to <HI>warn</HI> them, not to <HI>shame</HI> them, and that he did it out of his fatherly affeciion to them, whom he truly loved as his spi∣ritual Children, begotten by the Gospel which he had preached among them. For though others had since instructed them, yet they might remember that he <HI>first</HI> preached the Gospel unto them. Wherefore he exhorts them to be obedient to him as their <HI>spiritual Father;</HI> which that they might be, he tells them, he had for the present sent <HI>Timothy</HI> to them, who exactly knowing his whole course of <HI>Life, Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> and what <HI>Way</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Vias in Christo generatim, specialiùs vias docendi.</NOTE>, and <HI>Rule</HI> he followed in teach∣ing the Churches, should put them in remembrance of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things that concerned them.

<P>He comes n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to the <HI>second part</HI> of the Epistle, wherein he reprehends several <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="Chap."/> <HI>vices</HI> among them in the two following Chapters; and then satisfies some <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣stions</HI> or Cases of Conscience propounded unto him.

And he draws an argument from the custom of the ancient <HI>Jewish</HI> Church, in the celebration of their <HI>Passeover,</HI> who were then oblig'd to purge out all <HI>leaven</HI> among them, and during the whole Feast (in commemoration of their deliverance out of <HI>E∣gypt</HI>) to eat none but <HI>unleavened</HI> bread: so (says he) we that are Christi∣ans, Christ our <HI>Pascal Lamb</HI> being sacrific'd for us, should pass our whole time; and all our days, as a perpetual celebration and commemoration of that great re∣demption wrought for us by Him, keeping this <HI>spiritual Feast</HI> continually, so as not to allow <HI>in our selves,</HI> or to tolerate among us the <HI>leaven</HI> of naughtiness and wickedness, of uncleanness and vilany; but to practise all Christian purity, and to hold fast the truth that hath been delivered to us. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 9.</HI></P>

He instances particularly in <HI>meats,</HI> and shews the difference between the <HI>free use of them,</HI> and <HI>Fornication.</HI> He grants, that it is lawful to use any kind of meat, because God hath ordained it for the good of mans nature. Meats are or∣dain'd for the belly, and the belly for meats; but yet with a temporary conjunction: for as God will destroy meats, so he will destroy the belly also, as to the use it now hath: therefore for the sake of the belly we ought not to endanger our eternal Sal∣vation, or the Salvation of others, eating <HI>so,</HI> as may tend to enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urage them in sin. But now for <HI>Fornication</HI> (he shews) the case is otherwise. This he proves, to be utterly unlawful, and that for six reasons. <HI>1.</HI> The body was not made for Fornication (as the belly was made for meats), but for the service of Christ, and ought to be imployed to his glory, who is ordained to be the <HI>Head of man,</HI> to govern both his Soul and Body, that both may be kept holy. For Christ was sent to redeem and sanctifie the Body, at well as the Soul, and consequently to rule and
<PB N="162" REF="91"/> command it, being <HI>Lord</HI> of both. <HI>2,</HI> Our Bodies are not to be abolished and ut∣terly destroyed, but to be rais'd up to glory at the last day (as Christs Body was raised up) if we be such as truly believe in him, therefore they ought not to be <HI>defiled</HI> now, with Fornication. <HI>3.</HI> The faithful are <HI>Members</HI> of Christ, therefore they ought not to make themselves members of an Harlot. For as <HI>Wedlock</HI> makes Man and Wife one Body <HI>lawfully,</HI> so <HI>Fornication</HI> makes the Fornicator and the Har∣lot one Body <HI>unlawfully.</HI> As on the other side, he that is by Faith united to Christ is <HI>one Spirit</HI> with him, that is, is led and governed by one and the same Spirit, and becomes a Member of his spiritual and mystical Body. Therefore such a conjunction ought to be kept inviolable. <HI>4.</HI> Other sins abuse (chiefly and prin∣cipally) some object, that is, <HI>without</HI> the Body, (as the Drunkard <HI>wine, &amp;c.</HI>) but Fornication injuries the Body, that acts it, and that more than other sins. <HI>5.</HI> The Bodies of Believers are <HI>Temples of the Holy Ghost,</HI> (who dwells in them, being freely given them of God), and therefore they ought to be kept pure and undefiled. <HI>6.</HI> All true Believers and faithful Christians are not <HI>their own,</HI> but purchased with the Blood of Christ, therefore they should endeavour to glorifie God their <HI>Redeemer</HI> (whose they are) both in their Bodies, and in their Souls. <HI>From Ver. 12. to the end.</HI></P>

As in the first place, concerning <HI>marriage,</HI> touching which he declares; <HI>1.</HI> That for those that have the gift of Continency, and can live pure, and chast without marrying, 'tis better for them so to do. But for the avoiding all sorts of unclean∣ness and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llution, 'tis generally most safe, that men and women should betake themselves to the conjugal state. <HI>2.</HI> He shews, that married persons ought not to abstain from the conjugal society of Bed and Board, except it be by mutual consent, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r a time only, and that upon great and extraordinary occasion; namely, when they desire to give themselves more solemnly to <HI>fasting</HI> and <HI>prayer;</HI> which time being ended, they should come together again; lest by long abstinence, Satan should gain advantage over them. But as to <HI>that</HI> which he had said before, <HI>viz. that it was</HI> (generally speaking) <HI>most safe that men and women do betake them∣selves to the conjugal estate,</HI> he would have them so understand him, that he spake it by way of <HI>permission,</HI> allowing <HI>them</HI> to marry that found their condition to re∣quire it; but not by way of <HI>precept,</HI> as if he commanded <HI>any</HI> to marry. For he could wish (if it were the will of God), that the <HI>Corinthians</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>v.</HI> 7. Omnes] h. e.

But seeing this gift is not given to all, every one should consider how he is quali∣fied by God, as to this matter, namely, whether with ability to live chastly in a single life, or else had inclinations to marry; and accordingly should dispose of himself. Therefore to sum up what he had said, he tells them, that as to the <HI>unmarried</HI> and <HI>Widows,</HI> it was convenient they should abide in that estate, (if they could contain), because of the advantages of the single life; but if not, then it was better to marry, than to live inflam'd with sinful lusts. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 10.</HI></P>

For the <HI>first,</HI> he says, it is <HI>not lawful;</HI> in which decision, he only repeats an old command given by the autho∣rity of God, who in the institution of marriage established, that the married should be <HI>one flesh,</HI> and therefore should so continue: and not separate one from the o∣ther, <HI>Math. 19.6.</HI> Wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore he commands, that the Wife should not depart from her Husband, on the account of disagreements between them. But if she, pretending necessary reasons of departing, as <HI>danger of her life, &amp;c,</HI> shall for a

And the Husband likewise, he commands, not to put away his Wife <HI>on any such account,</HI> or to give her cause to depart. For the second Case, seeing (as it seems) some among them held themselves polluted by being married to <HI>unbelievers</HI> (whom they had married before their conversion), and thought therefore of parting from them; He tells them, <HI>God</HI> had not determined in the <HI>Law,</HI> what should be done in such a Case, but <HI>he,</HI> by special revelation from the Lord, and the assistance of his Spi∣rit would determine it, namely, that <HI>they should dwell together, unbelief</HI> be∣ing no sufficient ground of parting. For the conjugal society of the <HI>unbelieving</HI> party is <HI>sanctified</HI> (that is, made lawful and allow'd) to the <HI>believing</HI> party, (to the pure, and believing all things being pure, <HI>1 Tim. 4, 5.</HI>); and this he proves, because the Children born of such Parents, whereof the one is a Believer, and the other not, are <HI>federally holy,</HI> and are to enjoy the like priviledges, as if both Parents had been Believers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As meats are said to be sanctified in that place, <HI>by the word and prayer,</HI> that is made pure, lawfull and allowed to Believers.</NOTE>. But if the unbelieving party will not co-habit, but will depart, and on his side make void the bond of marriage out of hatred to the <HI>Faith,</HI> he declares that in such a case, the Believer or innocent party is free, and not bound by the bond of marriage any longer. But he tells them, God re∣quires that we should endeavour to live peaceably with all, and therefore the Be∣liever should use all peaceable endeavours to retain the unbeliever, and not give occasion of difference or departure; because by a peaceable dwelling together, the <HI>Believer</HI> may gain the <HI>unbeliever</HI> to the Faith of Christ, and be an instrument of his Salvation, <HI>[1 Pet. 3.1.]. From Ver. 10. to 17.</HI></P>

<P>And now taking occasion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mos est Pauli, obiter quaedam à re non aliena interjicere, ac deinde coeptum ser∣monem recipere. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> from what he had said, concerning the conjugal state, namely, that 'tis not to be deserted, because of the infidelity of one of the parties, he disgresses to a <HI>general Doctrine,</HI> concerning the <HI>outward condition</HI> and <HI>state</HI> of men; and shews, that every one should be content with the lot and condition which God hath distributed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> dicitur Deus, cum alicui sortem aliquam assignat natalium, fortunae, con∣jugii.</NOTE> unto him, and should frame himself to walk Christi∣anly in it, as he taught in all Churches.</P>
<P>Particularly he shews, that if any person that was before <HI>circumcised,</HI> be converted to Christianity, he should never trouble himself to get off that mark from his flesh, as some it seems did: nor on the other side, if any man that is <HI>uncir∣cumcis'd,</HI> be converted, he need not receive <HI>Circumcision,</HI> as some it seems re∣quired, <HI>Act. 15.1.</HI> For such outward things as these, he tells them, avail no∣thing now under the new Testament, or in the Church of Christ, who looks not on the outward condition of men, but on their obedience to his commands. Therefore he advises, that every one should abide contentedly in the Calling wherein he was called, and not think that <HI>Christianity</HI> frees him from any obligation that lay on him before. If a <HI>bond-man</HI> be converted, he should not think it a disparagement to his Chri∣stianity to continue a <HI>servant</HI> still, nor be solicitous of changing his condition: yet if by any fair regular means, he can obtain his freedom, he may make use of it. However let him know, that he that is called to believe in Christ, being a ser∣vant, is by the Lord freed from the bondage of sin and Satan; and he that is called being (as to his civil and outward estate) a <HI>free-man,</HI> is yet not exempt∣ed from subjection to Christ. In short, he tells them, that being dearly bought with a price by Christ<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aliqui sic.</HI> Are ye redeemed with a price? become not again the servants of men. <HI>scil. of Heathens.</HI></NOTE>, they should not serve men in things repugnant<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Christianos monet, ne pravis hominum libidinibus &amp; voluntatibus inserviant, sed ei, qui eos redemit. <HI>Lightf.</HI></NOTE> to his commands, nor submit themselves to such a servitude, as their high-flown Do∣ctors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Grot.</HI> in loc.</NOTE> would impose upon them.</P>
<P>Lastly, He urges again his former exhortation, that every one should content∣edly continue in the outward state wherein he was, when he was called, and not think of changing it, meerly on the account of Christianity, but holding to it, abide
<PB N="158" REF="92"/> with God, and continue faithful to him in his Church, in which he reigns. <HI>From Ver. 17. to 25.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3ly.</HI> He comes now to the third Inquiry, that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> made to him, namely, concerning <HI>Virgins, Male</HI> and <HI>Female.</HI> And first, concerning such as are at their own disposal, whether they should marry or no? To which Question, before he gives his answer, he pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mises, that he had no special command whereby the state of Virginity was either injoined or prohibited, but he would sincerely give his advice, as became him to whom God had vouchsafed mercy to be faithful. Then he gives his answer in three Propositions. <HI>1.</HI> That by reason of the present di∣stress, and danger of persecution, 'twas m st convenient, that those that were <HI>single,</HI> should so continue, if they have the gift of Continence. <HI>2.</HI> He declares, that if they marry they do not sin, only they will be like to meet with more troubles. But he would spare to speak any more to them of that matter, lest he should seem to disswade them from marriage more than was fit. However in this advice, he consulteth their qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and advantage. <HI>3.</HI> He advises, that whether they mar∣ried or not, they should consider, that the time is now but <HI>short,</HI> before persecu∣tion will arise, (possibly he means that under <HI>Nero</HI>); insomuch, that they ought to have their affections very much moderated to all things in the world: Those that have Wives, should be as if they had none; those that weep, like those that do not; those that rejoice, as those that rejoice not; those that buy and purchase, as if they possessed nothing; and those that use this World<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Utere nummo quemadmodum viator in stabulo utitur Mensâ, Calice, Urceo, dimissurus, non permansurus. <HI>Augustin.</HI></NOTE>, as not using it<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. tanquam non utentes, scilicet usu firmo &amp; tenaci.

For as a <HI>Scene</HI> which is soon changed, and shews a new face, so the fashion and shape of this present World is passing away, and the times are turning into very troublesome. He gives another reason, why the single life is to be preferr'd before the conjugal, namely, because single persons (comparatively) are more free from cares and distractions, and have (ordinarily) more time and lei∣sure to attend upon the Lord in religious exercises than the married have. For he that is <HI>unmarried,</HI> hath but one obligation of care, namely, how he may serve God most acceptably; but he that is <HI>married,</HI> hath another care on him, <HI>viz.</HI> how he may, in lawful things, please his Wife. And the like difference there is (as to this matter) between <HI>married</HI> Women and <HI>Virgins.</HI> A <HI>Wife</HI> is usually combred with houshold cares, and must, in lawful things, endeavour to please her Husband; and is not, upon that account, so free for holy exercises; but the <HI>Virgin</HI> (that has no family to care for) being freed from such distractions, and endeavouring to approve her self more eminently <HI>holy</HI> both in Soul and Body, she hath more leisure to attend on the Lord in holy and religious exercises. And what he spake concerning the advantages of a <HI>single life,</HI> he shews, he spake not that he might cast a snare upon them, or precisely to bind them to abstain from marriage, if they had not the gift of Continency, but to lead them to that which is <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>comely,</HI> that they may attend upon the Lord without distraction. <HI>From Ver. 25. to 36.</HI></P>

<P N="4"><HI>4ly.</HI> He comes in the next place to speak concerning Virgins, <HI>who are under the power of Parents and Guardians;</HI> and to answer the Question, Whether those Parents or Guardians may advise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly give their Virgins in marriage? In an∣swer to this, he says, that if there be these three things in the case, <HI>1.</HI> If any Pa∣rent or Guardian be suspected to detain his Virgin longer from marriage than is ex∣pedient. <HI>2.</HI> If she have passed the fl wer of her age, and begin to be more than of ripe years. <HI>3.</HI> If he see the mind of the Virgin much inclin'd to marriage, then <HI>he advises,</HI> that the Parent or Guardian should please her therein, and consent that she should marry, and in so doing he sinneth not. But if the Parent or Guar∣dian be stedfastly perswaded in his mind, that he wrongs not his Daughter, or Pu∣pil, in declining to marry her, and sees no necessity to seek a Husband for her, so that he hath power over his own will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>v.</HI> 37.

<P N="5"><HI>5ly.</HI> A <HI>fifth case</HI> they propounded to the Apostle, was, Whether <HI>second mar∣riages</HI> of Widows were lawful, or no?

<P N="6"><HI>6ly.</HI> A sixth Case of Conscience that they propounded to him, was, concerning <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="Chap."/> <HI>eating things offer'd to Idols;</HI> which case he resolves, by answering three things that might be brought in the defence of it. <HI>1.</HI> They might suppose that they were all sufficiently instructed in the liberty allowed them by the Gospel, so that they might lawfully eat things offer'd to Idols. <HI>Answ.</HI> He answers, that a false opi∣nion of knowledg, or knowledg which is not temper'd with Charity, for the most part, occasions men to be proud, and to despise their weak Brethren; but know∣ledg join'd with Charity, applieth it self to the instruction of others, and accommo∣dates it self to the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>edification</HI> of others that are weak; and considers what is fit to be done in reference to them. And if any man hath such a kind of knowledg, that is not accompanied with Charity, he knoweth not <HI>all his duty,</HI> nor to what end he ought to refer his knowledg, nor how to use it as he ought; and so, up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the matter, knoweth nothing in such sort, as he ought to know. But he that knows <HI>God,</HI> and truly loves <HI>him,</HI> and his <HI>Neighbour</HI> (according to his command), the same is known and approved of God. <HI>Ver. 1.2, 3.</HI></P>

Now this confirming a man in his sin, and encouraging him to his after-commissions, whose Conscience was before erroneous, and his practice sinful, is, as if instead of curing a sick man (which Charity requires us to do), we should wound and hurt him more; which is not only an act of great unchari∣tableness against our Brother, but an act of injury and robbery against Christ, in betraying a soul to ruin (as much as in us lyes) and hindring his salvation, for the saving of whom Christ died<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Augustimus dicit, pro <HI>omnibus</HI> valere Christi mortem quantum ad <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> magnitudinem, &amp; sufficientiam.

He concludes, that he had rather for ever abstain from all kind of flesh, than be the occasion of the ruin, or damnation of any weak Christian; much more would he deny himself the use of his Christian liberty in <HI>indifferent</HI> things, in respect of the <HI>weak,</HI> (though not of the obstinate and wilful) and abstain, at a certain time, and place, from flesh offered to Idols. <HI>From Ver. 8. to the end.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="Chap."/> He further shews <HI>his readiness</HI> to abridg himself in his Christian liberty, and therefore exhorts them, by his <HI>example</HI> that they would do the like, especially in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things that appertain to the <HI>Belly,</HI> and particularly in eating things offer'd to Idols. The sum of his argument is this, I being an <HI>Apostle,</HI> and no less free than any other, do not only abstain from things lawful and profitable to me, but also accommodate my self to the infirmities of all; yea I keep under my body, by abstinence for the service of the Gospel. Therefore ye Corinthians ought to do the like. The <HI>Antecedent</HI> be proves from <HI>v. 1. to 24.</HI> The <HI>Consequent,</HI> is an exhortation carried on, <HI>to the end of the Chapter.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> He shews that he had as much right to Christian liberty as any other, for he was an <HI>Apostle,</HI> he had been honoured with the sight of Christ, and was per∣sonally spoken to by him out of Heaven <HI>[Act. 22.18. 2 Cor. 12.2, 4.],</HI> and was immediately called by him to the Apostleship, and he had a Testimony thereof in
<PB N="167" REF="93"/> their conversion, which was as a <HI>Seal</HI> confirming his Apostleship (at least among them), and afforded him a defence against those that called his Apostleship into Question. <HI>Ver. 1.2, 3.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He shews, he had power to eat and drink at the cost and charge of the Church, as well as others; that he had liberty to marry, and to take a wife, and lead her about with him, as some other Apostles had done, (particularly, those that were Christs Cousin-Germans, and Peter, <HI>Mat. 8.14.</HI>): That he and <HI>Barnabas</HI> had power, as well as others, to forbear working with their hands at manual Trades, to get a livelihood; and might require maintenance from the Churches; it being a debt justly due to the Preachers of the Gospel; as be proves by several Arguments. <HI>1.</HI> By the <HI>Law of Nations,</HI> which appoints and allows to <HI>Souldiers, Vine-dressers,</HI> and <HI>Shepherds,</HI> and those that labour for the use of others, in their respective Callings, a due <HI>reward</HI> and <HI>wages:</HI> Why therefore should there not be a reward by the same reason, due to the Ministers of the Gospel. <HI>From Ver. 4. to 8.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He shews, he does not ground this, only upon <HI>human reason, equity,</HI> or <HI>custom,</HI> but upon the Provision made by God himself in the <HI>Levitical Law</HI> for the <HI>Ox that treadeth out the Corn.</HI> Now the end of Gods Law<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Quod de bobus praecepit id propter homines secit.</NOTE> is not only to shew and prescribe how <HI>Oxen should be fed,</HI> but to enjoin, that <HI>equity</HI> should be used, in the just rewarding those that labour for us; that he that ploweth, and thresheth in hope of reward, should partake of his hoped-for reward, which encourages him in his work. Why then should not they that labour in the Gospel, partake of the fruit of their labours? <HI>3.</HI> From common justice. If the Apostles have sown unto them spiritual things, 'tis nothing but justice they should, instead thereof, reap of their carnal things. <HI>4.</HI> From the example of their <HI>other Teachers</HI> at <HI>Corinth,</HI> who made use of this power, which was as law∣ful for him to do, as for them; but he had forborn it, lest he should hinder the course of the Gospel. <HI>5.</HI> From the example of the <HI>Levites,</HI> to whom <HI>mainte∣nance,</HI> and a part of the Sacrifices was given by God for their ministry.

<P>Having thus asserted his <HI>liberty,</HI> he shews, his <HI>moderation</HI> in the use of it. He tells them, he had not h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦therto made use of this power among <HI>them,</HI> (though from other Churches he sometimes received some liberality, <HI>2 Cor. 11.8.</HI>), nor desir'd to do it; nor did he write these things, that <HI>that</HI> should be done for <HI>him,</HI> that was done for other <HI>Teachers;</HI> for he had rather dye, than that false Teachers should be able to take this honour from him, which was so justly due to him, namely, <HI>That he had preached the Gospel for sincere ends, and not sought what was due to him for his pains.</HI> He shews, that if he had preached the Gospel, meer∣ly out of respect to profit, he had had no cause to boast. For he was obliged to preach it by virtue of his office, and the command of God, which he must not dis∣obey; but if he hath done it <HI>willingly,</HI> and without respect to any worldly pro∣fit thereby, it will be rewardable. But if he hath done it unwillingly<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Si ergo invitus hoc facio (nam viderer quasi invitus facere si refugerem sumptu proprio id facere) dispensatio quaedam mihi credita est à quâ gloria mihi non est expe∣ctanda.

This therefore was that which gave him hopes of a reward from God, namely, that he had preached the Gospel to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> without being chargeable to them. For if he had received maintenance there, where his <HI>Reproachers</HI> endeavour'd to bring an ill report upon him, to the prejudice of the Gospel which he had preached<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">In hoc casu cum aut detrimen∣tum gloriae divinae accrescere, aut scandalum proximo oriri verisimile sit, abutetur libertate suâ, si quis uta∣tur. <HI>Slat.</HI></NOTE>, then
<PB N="168" REF="94"/> he should have abused his liberty in receiving of it. <HI>From Ver. 15. to 19.</HI></P>
<P>He goes on to shew, how he did abridg himself in the use of his Christian Li∣berty; for though he was as <HI>free</HI> as any man, (being bound to none), yet he had made himself a servant to all, that he might gain the more to embrace the Gospel. For he had in a charitable condescention compli'd with the <HI>Jews</HI> (in cer∣tain external Ceremonies, <HI>Act. 21.21, 24, 25.</HI> who thought themselves bound to observe the Ceremonial Law), and that he did by the advice of the Council at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which left to the <HI>Jews</HI> (born under that yoke) a liberty to use those Ceremonies for a time, but in no wise to impose them on the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> When he had to deal with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> (that were not born under the Ceremo∣nial Law), he abstained from the use of those Ceremonies, as if he had been without the Law, as they were; yet as to the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> or <HI>Law of Love,</HI> (which is the perpetual Law of God, and re-inforc'd by Christ, and requires us to love God above all, and our Neighbour as our selves), he did never account himself free from <HI>that,</HI> but only from the <HI>Ceremonial Law,</HI> from which indeed he was freed, and when he saw it for the advantage of the Gospel, he did freely abstain from the observance of it. When he had to deal with those that were <HI>weak,</HI> and doubted of their liberty, he abstain'd from things lawful, as they did. Finally, in all things <HI>indifferent,</HI> he accommodated himself to <HI>all men,</HI> that he might gain <HI>as many</HI> as possible he could, at least-wise, <HI>some.</HI> And this he did, that the Gospel might be better esteem'd among all, and more propagated, and that he himself might partake of the glorious eternal rewards promised therein, together with them to whom he had preached it, and who had effectually entertain'd it. <HI>From Ver. 19. to 24.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto he hath set before them his own example; now he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes to the ex∣hort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>n which he infers from thence, namely, that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> would imi∣tate him in denying themselves.

To th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s end he shews them, that Christianity is a <HI>race,</HI> and they must run carefully this race; in which, not only one (as was usual in their common races), but all that run (according to the Laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See 2 Tim. 2.5.</NOTE> of God) shall be Crowned. And as those that contended in those famous Games (whether <HI>run∣ning</HI> or <HI>combating,</HI> usually celebrated neer to <HI>Corinth</HI>), did not indulge them∣selves in gluttony and pleasures, but were temperate in all things, inuring them∣selves to a spare diet, by way of preparation, that the conquering Crown might be won by them: After the same manner, he would have the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to be moderate in the use of worldly things, and to abstain from whatsoever may hin∣der them in their Christian course, that they may attain an incorruptible and an eternal Crown.</P>
<P>And to press his exhortation yet further, he propounds his own example again, who first did so <HI>run,</HI> not as at <HI>uncertainties,</HI> or as if he did not aim at a certain Goal, or as if he knew not his reward, if he ran well; and secondly, did so <HI>fight</HI> (not as making a flourish only in the air like a fencer), but he did fight in good earnest, against the body<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Castigo corpus me∣um, h. e. ad∣versus car∣nem meam pugn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> of sin, and the old man, and the lusts of the flesh, that they might be subdued in him; and he denied himself in some <HI>indifferent liberties,</HI> that his body might be subject to his spirit: And all this, lest having prescribed to others the way of <HI>striving</HI> and <HI>getting the Crown,</HI> he himself should at last prove a <HI>Castaway</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>, or one unworthy to be approved or rewarded by God. <HI>From Ver. 24. to the end.</HI></P>

And this w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a figure to which our Baptism answers, by which we are confirm'd in the Faith of Christ, and obliged to profess him, own him, and obey him. He farther shews, that God fed them with <HI>Manna</HI> from Heaven, and gave them for drink, the <HI>water</HI> that flowed out of the Rock (which he caused to follow their Camp). And this <HI>Manna</HI> and <HI>water,</HI> he calls <HI>spiritual meat</HI> and <HI>drink,</HI> because they had a spiritual meaning, and did figure and signifie the same grace and benefits of Christ, which the <HI>Supper of the Lord</HI> doth to us; yet notwithstanding all this, he shews, that many of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <HI>Israelites</HI> (by reason of their inordinate lusts) perished in the Wilderness. N w th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things, he tells them, were to be examples to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> and other Christians, that they do not indulge themselves in <HI>fleshly Lusts,</HI> as those ancient <HI>Israelites</HI> did, nor frequent <HI>idolatrous Feasts,</HI> (made in the honour of any Idol) lest they suffer the like punishment the <HI>Israelites</HI> did, who sacrificed to the honour of the Golden Calf, and rose up, and danced before it, <HI>Exod. 32.</HI> And they should take heed, that they mix not with <HI>Idolaters</HI> in their Feasts, lest they should be given up to <HI>Fornication,</HI> as the <HI>Israelites</HI> were in the Wilderness <HI>[Numb. 25.]</HI> with the Daughters of <HI>Moab,</HI> and so fell in one day three and twenty<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Numb.</HI> 25.9.

Further they should take heed of <HI>tempting</HI> Christ, and trying, as it were, how long his patience will last; as the <HI>Israelites</HI> provoked the <HI>Angel of the Cove∣nant,</HI> or <HI>Christ</HI> (who went before them in the Wilder∣ness, <HI>Numb. 8.21.</HI>), and so perished by fiery Serpents. And Lastly, they should take heed of <HI>murmuring,</HI> because 'tis not lawful for them, by the Christian Religion, to be present at the Idolatrous Feasts of their Friends in the Idol Temples, lest they should perish with the murmuring <HI>Israelites,</HI> who for that sin were destroyed by the Angel of God, and perished by the plague, <HI>Numb. 14.37.</HI> Now he shews, that all these sins and judgments of the <HI>Israelites</HI> are <HI>Emblems</HI> of <HI>their</HI> state, and shew what will befall <HI>them,</HI> that do not beware of such sins; and these judgments are set down in the old Testament for warnings to Christians, who should live in the latter times. Wherefore he adviseth them to take heed of vain-confidence in themselves, and that those among them that seem∣ed to themselves to stand firmest, should be sensible of their danger, if they fed se∣curely upon things offered to Idols, in Idol-Temples. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 13.</HI></P>
<P>But h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re they might object, that if they abstain'd from idolatrous Feasts, there was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger hung over their heads from their <HI>Fellow-Citizens,</HI> (that were Ido∣laters) who would interpret this forbearance, as an abhorring of their society. He answers, that <HI>that temptation</HI> was no other then what was ordinary to men. But God was faithful who would not permit them to be tempted above their strength, but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld open a way for them to escape those dangers, if they continued faithful to him, or else would so strengthen them that they should be able to bear whatsoever bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll them. Therefore he exhorts them to fly from that Idolatry which
<PB N="170" REF="95"/> is join'd to the publick eating of things offered to Idols. And to excite their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttention, he tells them, he would make them Judges themselves (who were understanding men) in this matter, whether they must not necessarily commu∣nicate in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Idolatry, for which these Feasts were instituted, if they join∣ed in those Feasts: And first he reasons from the example of Christians com∣municating in the Lords Supper. For as all that partake in that <HI>Sacrament</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fess themselves, in that act, to have c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmunion with <HI>Christ,</HI> and with <HI>such</HI> as profess Faith in him. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> communicating in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <HI>Idol-Feasts,</HI> is no less a sign, and prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of communion with those <HI>Idols,</HI> to whom the Sacrifice was offered, and with <HI>those Idolaters</HI> that worship them. For as Christians, though many, yet by virtue of their society in the same worship, are compacted together, as it were, into <HI>one Loaf</HI> or <HI>Lump,</HI> that is, into one <HI>mystical Body</HI> (whereof Christ is the Head) in that they partake of <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> Sacramental Bread; so those that communicate with Idolaters (in participating of idolatrous Sacri∣fic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s), by virtue of their Society in the same worship (signified by their idolatrous f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting together in Idol-Temples) are compacted together, as it were, into one body, forasmuch as they communicate in <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> Sacrifices.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He reasons from the like example of the <HI>present carnal</HI><NOTE N="(a" PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 18. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] q d. <HI>nos</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Israe∣litae sumus qui in Chri∣stum credi∣mus. <HI>Illi</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Jews,</HI> who had their Temple yet standing, and their <HI>Jewish</HI> worship in use. For as they, cating of the Sacrifices, did, in <HI>that,</HI> communicate with the <HI>Altar,</HI> and profess themselves Members of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church, and worshippers of that God, whose the <HI>Altar</HI> was: So they that eat of Idol Sacrifices, in the idolatrous Feasts, have communion with those <HI>Idols,</HI> to whose honour they were instituted, and with <HI>those</HI> that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rship them. He shews, he need not affirm, that an Idol was <HI>any thing,</HI> that is, had any thing of divinity in it, or that <HI>that which was offered in Sacrifice to Idols,</HI> was in it self, at all different from any other ordinary meat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.4.</NOTE>. But the plain truth was, Those Sacrifices of the Heathens were Sacrifices to <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vils [2 Chron. 11.15.],</HI> and whosoever did eat of those <HI>Feasts,</HI> was supposed to join in those <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> and so to do service to Devils. Now the communicating with Christ in the Lords Supper, could not consist with communi∣cating with Devils in <HI>Idol-Feasts;</HI> for this were to do homage to <HI>two</HI> Lords, <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> and profess service to both. He concludes this matter, by sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing what desperate madness it was, to provoke the omnipotent God to jealousie, by j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining Devils in competition with him. <HI>From Ver. 13. to 23.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus resolved the case concerning <HI>publick</HI> eating of things offered to Idols, namely, in the Idol-Temples; He comes now to answer another Case con∣cerning <HI>private buying,</HI> and <HI>private eating</HI> of things offered to Idols. And first he pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mises that all things (that are of an <HI>indifferent</HI> nature) are <HI>lawful,</HI> unless when it was not expedient in respect of our weak Brother to use them, or when they edifie not. And in the use of liberty, we must regard, rather the <HI>Sal∣vation</HI> of another, than our own temporal profit. Having premised this, he tells them, They may lawfully buy what is sold in the shambles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">It was a Custom, it seems, to set to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le in the Market, <HI>Flesh that was sacrificed,</HI> as well as other Flesh, the gain whereof went to the Priests.</NOTE>, and freely eat thereof, without any scruple of Conscience. And he gives them this reason for it, <HI>because, the earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof,</HI> that is, those things that are sold for food in the Market, are to be look'd upon as the Creatures of God, made for the use of man, and so lawful to the <HI>faith∣ful,</HI> if they be received with thanksgiving, <HI>1 Tim. 4.4.</HI> And the Devil hath no power over them, to contaminate or defile them by his Idols, if man himself do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t do it, by same sin, and particularly by that of Idolatry. And therefore if any <HI>Believer</HI> be invited to a Feast, in the private house of an <HI>Unbeliever,</HI> he de∣clares, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christian may eat without scruple, any meat that is set before him: But if the Master of the Feast, or any other there present, shall suggest to him, that some part of the meat had been offered to Idols; in that case, he wills him to forbear, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st he should encourage any man in idolatry. And the reason he gives is this, <HI>For the earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof,</HI> that is, there is
<PB N="171" REF="95"/> plenty of other meat to be had, which God the Creator of all things, the Lord of the whole Earth hath allowed us the free use of, so that we may well let the <HI>Idol-Sacrifices</HI> alone. In such a case, the Christian should abstain for the sake of the <HI>other man's</HI> Conscience, lest he should, by his Example, be encouraged in Ido∣latry. But in other cases, where there is no such danger, they may freely eat without scruple, and none will have cause to blame them for it. If any do, their liberty <HI>allowed them by Christ,</HI> is unjustly condemn'd by such a mans Conscience. For if they, through the grace and favour allowed them in the Gospel, do eat in∣differently of meats set before them (where they see no danger of hardning any thereby in Idolatry) why should they be reproached for eating <HI>that</HI> which God allowes them; they receiving it with thanksgiving, <HI>1 Tim. 4 4.</HI> He concludes this whole discourse with these three excellent <HI>Rules,</HI> whereby they should govern themselves in the use of <HI>things indifferent. 1.</HI> They should always design the glory of God. <HI>2.</HI> They should do nothing that may tend to the <HI>hurt</HI> or <HI>just of∣fence</HI> of <HI>Jews, Gentiles,</HI> or <HI>Christians. 3.</HI> They should imitate the Apostles Example, who in <HI>indifferent things</HI> accommodated himself to all men; so as to seek their eternal Salvation, and not his own temporal profit or advantage. And so they should be followers and imitators of him, as He was of Christ. <HI>From Ver. 23. to the end. And Ver. 1. of Chap. 11.</HI></P>
<P>Being now about to reprehend certain disorders in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> he <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="Chap."/> begins with <HI>commendation</HI> of those among them who had written to him, and ask'd his advice in those particulars.</P>
<P>He commends them that they had been so mindful of the instructions and pre∣cepts he had delivered to them, concerning the matters appertaining to the publick worship of God, and had so closely adhered to them: yet notwithstanding, it seems, there were many things reproveable in several others of them. And so be pro∣ceeds to answer their next Query, which concerned <HI>decent behaviour</HI> of <HI>men</HI> and <HI>women</HI> in Church-Assemblies. In order to which, he tells them, 'tis fit they should consider the <HI>subordination</HI> of persons in the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> that as Christ, in respect of his Mediatory Office, is inferior to God the <HI>Father;</HI> but above all men (being Head and Lord of all men, as their Creator and Redeemer); so the <HI>Man,</HI> being inferior to Christ, is yet above the <HI>Woman,</HI> being her <HI>Head.</HI> From which they may understand, that order in Church-Assemblies is to be obser∣ved. Now, it seems, the <HI>Corinthians</HI> did not sufficiently observe this order, because the <HI>Women</HI> in their publick Church-meetings laid aside their Veil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Velamen, signum non solum sub∣jectionis sed pudefactionis, quòd Fae∣mina primùm peccatum introduxerit in mundum. <HI>Lightf.</HI></NOTE>, and the <HI>Men</HI> covered their Heads and Faces. He shews therefore, that every <HI>Man,</HI> that either makes the publick <HI>Prayer</HI> in the Church-Assemblies, or he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, or joineth therewith; or <HI>Prophesieth,</HI> that is, expoundeth the writings of the Prophets, and opens the mysteries of Salvation, or <HI>heareth</HI> such expositions, or instructions; or joins with the Congregation in <HI>singing Psalms</HI> or Hymnes, having any <HI>covering</HI> on his Head, that is, ha∣ving his Head and Face covered, he dishonoureth himself, and does an <HI>indecent</HI> thing against the liberty and dignity of his <HI>Sex,</HI> it being a sign of <HI>shame</HI> and <HI>infamy</HI> for a man to have his head cover'd, but was a sign of <HI>power</HI> and <HI>dominion</HI> (in that Country)<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">As on the contrary now at this day among us, those that have power over others, keep their heads covered, and they that are inferior to others, keep their heads uncove∣red before them.</NOTE>, to have his Head, and Face bare and uncovered. Next he shews, that eve∣ry <HI>Woman,</HI> that lays aside her Veil in the Church-Assem∣blies, dishonours her self, doing a thing <HI>unbecomming</HI> her Sex, and against the dignity of the <HI>Man,</HI> to whom she (by that action) seems to deny subjection. Now he says, 'tis as <HI>unseemly</HI> for the Woman to be unveiled, as to be <HI>shorn</HI> or shaven, which would be a great disgrace to her, yea, against the mo∣d sty of her Sex, to wear her hair short as men do, her hair being given her for an ornamental covering, and as it were a natural Veil. <HI>2ly.</HI> The Image of God shineth most brightly in the <HI>Man</HI> (who is immediately his Image), <HI>viz.</HI> the Image of his Power and Majesty; and ought so to appear, by having his head un∣covered.

<P>He comes now to discourse concerning the right administration of the <HI>Lords Sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r,</HI> and he blames the <HI>Corinthians</HI> that their coming together to celebrate that ordinance, was generally, not for the better, but for the worse. For he heard there were <HI>divisions</HI> and <HI>factions</HI> among them <HI>[1 Cor. 1.11.];</HI> nay <HI>Heresies</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Schism,</HI> is a difference about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es or external D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scipline. <HI>Heresie</HI> is a difference about Doctrine and Faith.</NOTE>; which, considering the <HI>cor∣ruption</HI> of Man, and the <HI>malice</HI> of the Devil, he did not much wonder at, especially seeing God in his infinite wisdom permits it so to be, that the <HI>sincere</HI> among them might the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manifest their stedfastness. He tells them, that their behaviour when they met together on this occasion, was far different from what was becoming the cele∣bration of the Lords Supper, they not carrying themselves therein as if they were to celebrate a religious Feast<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>This is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>at the Lords Sup∣per</HI> You do not do a legally and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olemnly according to Christs insti∣tution.</NOTE>.

<PB N="173" REF="96"/> neither celebrated at the <HI>same time</HI> by all, nor in <HI>holy con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord,</HI> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y to the true Ʋnion of Christians, signified thereby. And further, the <HI>po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re were excluded, while the <HI>rich</HI> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted, and in their feastings, drank t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o liberally, even unto drunkenness. He tells them, he could not praise them f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r this. If they had a mind to feast, they should do it at their own houses; and not dish n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, and as it were, cast a contempt on the publick Assembly, by such irreligious carriage, nor so despise the Poor (which are part of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds Church) and put them to shame, by excluding them out of their Company for their poverty sake. For sith God admits them into his Family, and bids them to his heavenly ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uet, they ought not to exclude them from this holy Feast. That therefore he may correct th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se misde∣meanours, he recites the <HI>primitive institution</HI> of the Sacrament, which he had formerly delivered to them, as he had rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived it from Christ by <HI>special revela∣tion,</HI> either when he was ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t up into the third H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aven, or when Christ appeared to him at his first Conversion <HI>[Gal. 1.12.]; viz.</HI> That our blessed Saviour, in the night wherein he was betrayed, took Bread, and having, <HI>by</HI><NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">The prayer he u∣sed, consisted of two parts: compare <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.26. with this place.</NOTE> <HI>praising God for it,</HI> and <HI>imploring his blessing upon it,</HI> consecrated it to this holy use, he <HI>brake it,</HI> and bad them eat it, as <HI>that</HI> which should signifie and repre∣sent <HI>his body</HI><NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>This is my Body]</HI> Metonym. i. e.

<P>Having declared the original institution of this Sacrament; he comes next, to instruct them in the <HI>right use</HI> of it. He tells them, that whosoever shall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord <HI>unworthily,</HI> that is, otherwise then is meet, and becoming so holy an ordinance, (particularly without such a disposition of mind, such a preparation of heart, such reverence and devotion as ought there∣in to be exercis'd) shall be guilty of <HI>prophaning this Sacrament,</HI> (which is the remembrance of Christs death), and of <HI>vilifying</HI> the <HI>signs</HI> and <HI>pledges</HI> of his body and blood. Therefore every man should duly examine himself, whether he be a fit guest for so holy, and heavenly a Table, whether he have a competent <HI>knowledg</HI> of the <HI>nature, signification, end,</HI> and <HI>use</HI> of this Feast, and <HI>dis∣cern</HI> how it represents the Lords Body; whether he truly repent him of his sins, have a lively Faith in Christ, and be in Charity with his Neighbours; such therefore as cannot examine themselves, are not to be admitted unto this ordi∣nance. And seeing the Apostle says, <HI>let him examine himself,</HI> and <HI>so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup,</HI> we may observe from thence, that he calls it <HI>bread</HI> still, even after consecration. 'Tis <HI>bread</HI> still, though not <HI>ordi∣nary</HI> and <HI>common bread,</HI> whilst it is applied to this use. <HI>2.</HI> We see from hence that the Sacrament must be received in <HI>both kinds</HI> because Christ so instituted it, and to receive it otherwise is a palpable violation of his order. The Apostle fur∣ther
<PB N="174" REF="97"/> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clares, that he that eates and drinks <HI>unworthily,</HI> that is, <HI>ignorantly, irreverently, prophanely,</HI> is guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, of prophaning that Ordinance, which he hath ordained for the representation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his death, (wherein his Body was broken, and his Blood shed for our sins) and so incurs the danger of temporal judgment and chastisement here, and without repen∣tance, of eternal hereafter, for hearing no greater respect to this holy action; nor discerning how this <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> represent the Lords Body, but coming to it as to an ordinary meal. And that this would be the Fruit of approaching unwor∣thily to this Table, he proves from the sad experience of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> them∣selves, upon some of whom God had inflicted <HI>diseases,</HI> and upon others <HI>death,</HI> for their prophaning of this Ordinance. Therefore this judgment ought to be prevented by their <HI>judging</HI> of themselves, and repenting and reforming. For when God in∣flicts those Chastisements on his own people, he inflicts them as f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therly Cor∣rections to bring them to repentance and reformation, that they may not perish with the World.</P>
<P>In closing up this matter, he exhorts them, that they would partake of this <HI>holy Supper</HI> together, tarrying one for another, and seems to forbid their <HI>Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> or <HI>Love-Feasts,</HI> that they used before the holy Communion, commanding that if need were, they should eat at home, to satisfie their hunger, and avoid the dan∣ger of prophaning this holy Supper, and so drawing down judgment on themselves. As for other things that concern'd the <HI>good order</HI> and government of their Church, he tells them he will take care himself when he comes to them. <HI>From Ver. 27. to the end.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="Chap."/> The next Case he handles, is concerning <HI>spiritual gifts,</HI> and the <HI>right use</HI> of them. It seems <HI>they,</HI> that excelled in them, were proud of them, and used them to vain-ostentation and discord, and not to their Brethrens edification. There∣fore he t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls them, that as touching spiritual gifts, he would not have them ig∣norant, from <HI>whence</HI> they come (<HI>viz.</HI> not from themselves, but all from <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same Spirit</HI> of God), nor to what <HI>end</HI> they are given, and <HI>how</HI> they ought lo be <HI>used</HI> and imployed. He tells them, they may remember, they were once <HI>idolatrous Gentiles,</HI> serving dumb<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Though the Devils sometimes sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke in and by the Idols, yet the Id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls themselves had mouths and spake not.</NOTE> Idols, ac∣cording as they were led by their idolatrous Priests, and had nothing of this divine <HI>Spirit</HI> among them; but now they ought to be sensible, that their conversion from <HI>Gen∣tilism</HI> to Christianity, was the powerful work of this <HI>Spi∣rit</HI> of God. And <HI>this Spirit</HI> of God, he shews, does always glorifie Christ, and proclaim him to be <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Lord,</HI> and whosoever blasphemes Christ (as the un∣believing <HI>Jews</HI> did, and some vagabond Sorcerers) does not speak from this Spi∣rit. But he, that out of sincere affection, and true Faith, does profess that <HI>Christ is the Lord,</HI> he does it by the guidance and instinct of the Spirit of God. Ha∣ving premised this, he shews, there are diversities of gifts, such as <HI>prophesying, speaking with strange tongues, &amp;c.</HI> (some more excellent than others) and diversly imparted, and in divers measures; but 'tis <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same Spirit</HI> that distributes them all. There are also diversities of <HI>administrations,</HI> or offices, and functions in the Church, but <HI>one Lord Jesus</HI> who instituted them all, and who calleth <HI>one</HI> to this kind of Ministry, <HI>another</HI> to that. And further there are diversities of <HI>operations,</HI> or miraculous works, such as <HI>casting out Devils, &amp;c.</HI> but 'tis the same <HI>God,</HI> namely, the <HI>Father,</HI> who by his Son, and holy Spirit worketh all these, in all them in whom they are wrought. But those divers spi∣ritual gifts (wherein the power of the Spirit is manifested) are given for <HI>one end, viz</HI> the edification of the Church, as he instances in <HI>nine</HI> kinds of them: <HI>1.</HI> The word of <HI>Wisdom</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">vid. <HI>Glas∣sius</HI> in loc.</NOTE>, whereby he can seasonably apply sound Doctrine to his Hearers; which is the gift of a Pastor. <HI>2.</HI> The word of <HI>Knowledg,</HI> whereby he can give the sense of the Scriptures; which is the gift of the Tea∣cher. <HI>3.</HI> The gift of <HI>Faith,</HI> or of Confidence and Courage in God, in great dan∣gers. <HI>4.</HI> The gift <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Healing. 5.</HI> The gift of working <HI>Miracles</HI> and power∣fully
<PB N="175" REF="97"/> casting out Devils, and curbing the enemies of the Church, <HI>[See Act. 13.11.]. 6.</HI> The gift of <HI>Foretelling</HI> things to come, and rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling Secrets. <HI>7.</HI> The gift of <HI>Discerning</HI> Impostors, from those acted by the Spirit of God. <HI>8.</HI> The gift of <HI>Speaking</HI> with divers kinds of Tongues. <HI>9.</HI> The gift of <HI>Interpreting</HI> Tongues, though they had not the gift of speaking them: These two being diffe∣rent gifts. All these <HI>gifts</HI> worketh that <HI>one</HI> and <HI>same blessed Spirit;</HI> and the divers distributions of them, are according to the good will of God, Now that these spiritual gifts are to be used without discord, to the good of the whole Church, he proves, because the universal Christian Church, is but <HI>one spiritual body,</HI> where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Christ is the Head. For all true Believers are by the power and effectual operation of the <HI>same Spirit</HI> ingrafted into Christ by <HI>Baptism,</HI> and so incorporated into one Body, of what state and condition soever they be, and are all made to drink one <HI>Cup</HI> in the Lords Supper, that they may be partakers more and more of the graces of one and the same sanctifying<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">vid. <HI>Piscat.</HI></NOTE> Spirit, who <HI>vivi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies</HI> all the Members of that Body. So that all the faithful are joined together in the Sacraments of <HI>Baptism,</HI> and the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> and their union into <HI>one Church,</HI> and their partaking of <HI>one Spirit,</HI> is signified thereby. And the diver∣sity of gifts given to the particular Members ought not to occasion any dissention or disagreement in the Church. This he illustrates by a comparison taken from the natural Body; the very condition of which does necessarily require <HI>plurality</HI> and <HI>diversity</HI> of Members. One Member, though never so excellent, does not make a Body; and the meanest Members are of the Body, and so to be reckoned, as well as the more excellent. Nay the more excellent Members, such as the <HI>eye</HI> and <HI>ear,</HI> have need of the inferior. And as God hath set the Members of the Body, each one in his place, and each one for its special use and service for the good of the whole: So he hath given diversity of gifts and administrati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns to the Church, for the welfare of the whole. And as it would be repugnant to the nature of an <HI>or∣ganical</HI> Body, to be without divers Members<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Corporis unitatem non tollit membrorum varietas, sed ponit magis.</NOTE>, so the nature of the <HI>organical</HI> Church would be overthrown, did it not consist of many Offices, as of so many Members, u∣nited together in one Body. Therefore the superior Mem∣bers must not pride it over the inferior: for those Members of the Body that seem most feeble and weak, are necessary to the others. The Organs of nourishment, though they be not so noble, yet are they more absolutely necessary than those of the Senses, for without them, Man cannot subsist or live, as he may without Eyes, Ears, or Hands. And those Members of the Body, which seem to us less honourable<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">Membra illa ab Apostolo ap∣pell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntur inhonesta, &amp; indecora non <HI>per se</HI> sed <HI>comparatè,</HI> ratione eorum quae eximiâ venustate sunt praedita. <HI>Fullerus.</HI></NOTE>, on them we put more abundant honour by decent clothing them, and on our uncomely parts we put more abundant adorning by a decent covering them. For our comel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> parts, such as the <HI>Face,</HI> have no need of covering or adorning, being comely enough of themselves; But God has so dis∣posed the several parts of the Body, that some shall have a natural comeliness, or beauty; others that want <HI>that,</HI> shall be supplied by <HI>Clothes,</HI> which are an artificial Beauty: By all which, he shews, they should be instructed, that the meanest <HI>Officers,</HI> and those that have the <HI>least gifts are</HI> as well of that spiritual Body the Church, as those that have more excellent Offices and gifts. And as the meaner must not envy the more excellent, and so, in a dis∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntent, withdraw themselves from the Body, and forbear to imploy themselves for the common good of the whole; so the more excellent must not despise the meaner, but put a due respect and value upon them. And as the natural Body would come to ruin by <HI>Schism,</HI> if the Members should strive am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng themselves, and should not regard the welfare of one another; so great mischiefs must needs arise to the Church by dissentions. But on the contrary, as in the natural Body, there is a sympathy<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">Ut cum <HI>talo</HI> Spina inhaeserit, universum corpus sentit delorem &amp; curationem adhibet.</NOTE> among the superior and inferior Mem∣bers, a fellow-feeling with each other, both of joy and grief; so all the true Members of the Church, of what degree soever, ought to have the same common interests,
<PB N="176" REF="98"/> and concernments, and mutually to sympathize with each other, both in weal, and we. All this from <HI>v. 12.</HI> the Ap stle applies to the believing <HI>Corinthians,</HI> whom he acknowledges to be a part of this <HI>mystical</HI> Body of Christ, whereof each Believer in particular is a Member, who ought therefore so to carry himself to∣wards his fellow-members as is shewen in the former comparison, namely, as the Members<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">In corpore naturali membra praecipua, decentissima, validissima pro¦caeteris solicita sunt, ut infirmitatem solentur, indecorum ornent, dolori condoleant: Ergo corporis Christi membra eandem pro se curam &amp; sol∣licitudinem mutuam praestare de∣bent.</NOTE> of the natural body do towards one ano∣ther. And having spoken so much of the diversity of gifts and Ecclesiastical administrations (of which be had sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken in the general, <HI>v. 5.</HI>) he now comes to reckon up the particular <HI>officers</HI> that God hath set in his Church. <HI>1. Apostles,</HI> as those that were appointed to lay the foun∣dation of Churches. <HI>2. Prophets,</HI> who interpreted the Prophetical parts of the Scripture, by a special and extra∣ordinary gift. <HI>3. Teachers,</HI> namely, such who are ordinarily called to interpret the Scriptures for the edification of the Church. <HI>4.</HI> Such as are endowed with power to work <HI>miracles</HI> of <HI>various kinds,</HI> and particularly of punishing enemies to the Gospel <HI>5.</HI> Such as have this power restrained to the <HI>cure of Diseases. 6. Helps,</HI> that is, such as were to take care of the mainte∣nance of <HI>Ministers,</HI> and the <HI>poor,</HI> namely, <HI>Deacons. 7. Governments,</HI> that is, Ruling Elders (as some learned men understand it, according to <HI>Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5.17.</HI>), who are to take care of the peoples manners, with the Pastors and Teachers. Lastly, Such as were inabled to speak strange Tongues, or to inter∣pret them. In conclusion, he shews, that seeing the Ministers of the Church have not all administrations of the <HI>same kind,</HI> nor of equal dignity; therefore those that have the highest, ought not to despise those who are of a lower degree; neither ought these to envy the other, and so contend one against another, but all of them ought to imploy their gifts for the common good of the Church. And in or∣der hereunto he advises them to lay aside all <HI>evil emulation,</HI> and to covet the m st excellent gifts, namely, such as are most useful and profitable to the Church. And he tells them, he will shew them a more <HI>excellent way</HI> than that they were in, which is this, to lay aside all contention, pride, and envying one another, and to order all their actions by the rule of <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="Chap."/> Now for <HI>Charity,</HI> he proves it to be the most excellent gift, and for to surp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss all other gifts by four Arguments. <HI>1.</HI> He shews them, that the gifts they were so ambitious of, were nothing without Charity. This he proves by instancing in five sorts of them. <HI>1.</HI> Suppose a man had the gift of Tongues in the highest de∣gree, so that he could speak all the Tongues that any men in the World were ever able to speak, or that the Angels<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Suppositio nihil ponit in esse.</NOTE> themselves would speak, if they con∣versed with men, yet if he have not Charity, he makes only an unprofitable sound, and a vain ostentation. <HI>2.</HI> Suppose he had the gift of Prophesie in the highest degree, so that he could understand the darkest mysteries of the Scripture. <HI>3.</HI> Sup∣pose he had the highest degree of miraculous Faith<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">The Faith of working Mira∣cles may be severed from Charity; but justifying Faith cannot, which always worketh by Love.

And so likewise that gift whereby God enableth us to instruct others, is but imperfect, and shall then cease, because we shall have no further use of it. But when the perfect knowledg of divine things shall come, then our imperfect gifts which served to promote knowledg in this life shall cease. He illustrates this, by a twofold similitude; <HI>1.</HI> By comparing <HI>this life</HI> to <HI>childhood,</HI> and the <HI>fu∣ture</HI> to the <HI>manly state,</HI> wherein childish things are abolished. <HI>2.</HI> By shewing there is as great a difference betwixt our present knowledg in this life, and that which we shall have hereafter, as between one that seeth the image of anothers face in a Glass, and one that beholdeth the face it self. Here we know God in his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> as in a Glass, by reflection; but there we shall know him <HI>intuitively,</HI> and immediately. And as there is a great difference between propounding a thing darkly and as a riddle, and propounding the same thing in plain, proper, and express words. So here we see as by a Glass, or in a Riddle, but then shall we know God face to face, that is, clearly and perfectly. And as for himself, who was an Apostle, and had been rapt up into the third Heaven, he acknowledges he knew but in part for the present, but hereafter he assured himself, his mind shall be so inlightned by God, that he shall see him and know him immediately, as God now sees and knows him, though not so perfectly. In Conclusion, he tells them, that in this life, these three emi∣nent Graces do operate in the hearts of Believers <HI>Faith, Hope,</HI> and <HI>Charity;</HI> Without <HI>Faith</HI> we cannot be justified, without <HI>Hope</HI> Faith cannot stand, and by <HI>Love</HI> Faith must be operative. But of these three, the greatest is <HI>Charity. 1.</HI> In respect of its <HI>extent,</HI> reaching to God, good Angels, our Brethren, our Enemies. <HI>2.</HI> In respect of its <HI>use,</HI> extending to the good of <HI>others;</HI> whereas <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> are only private graces. <HI>3.</HI> In respect of its <HI>duration,</HI> be∣cause <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> shall cease in the other life; <HI>Faith</HI> shall be swallowed up in <HI>Vision,</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> in <HI>Fruition,</HI> but <HI>Charity</HI> shall abide for ever. <HI>From Ver. 8. to the end.</HI></P>
<P>And seeing <HI>Charity</HI> is so excellent a grace, he shews, they should very care∣fully <MILESTONE N="14" UNIT="Chap."/> labour for it; yet spiritual gifts also they should earnestly and zealously desire, especially that of <HI>interpreting the Holy Scripture,</HI> as the most useful for the edification of the Church. It seems, some among them much affected the gift of Tongues, and despised Pastoral gifts in comparison thereof. He therefore proves the gift of Prophesie, or Exhortation, to be more excellent than the gift of Tongues, separated from the gift of Interpretation. For he that speaks in an unknown
<PB N="178" REF="99"/> Tongue<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Opinamur, nec sine ratione linguam istam ignotam quâ usi sunt isti vel abusi potius in Ecclesiâ fuisse linguam Hebraeam, &amp;c. <HI>Lightf.</HI> in loc.</NOTE>, although by the gift of the Spirit, he speak the mysteries of God, yet he speaks without profit, because he is understood by God alone, and not by his Hearers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Prayer in the Church in an un∣known Tongue, crosseth, in a man∣ner, this whole Chapter.</NOTE>. But a Prophet, or a Pastor speaking in a known T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngue, teaches, exhorts, comforts his Hearers, and so speaks pro∣fit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly, and to their edification. He that speaks in an unknown Tongue, edifies none but hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf; but a Prophet speaking in a known Tongue, speaks to the edification of the whole Church, or Assembly. He wishes they all spake with Tongues, but prefers <HI>Prophesie</HI> as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re useful to the Church, except it be joined with Interpretation. This he amplifies, by instancing in his own person, who he says, should not profit them meerly by speaking to them in an unknown Tongue; but if he spake <HI>intelligibly</HI> to them, that is, either revealed things to come, or communicated his knowledg in the deep mysteries of Religion, and the sa∣cred Figures; or interpreted the prophetick part of the Scripture; or in a plain Catechistical way instructed them in things they were to <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>do,</HI> then indeed he should speak to their profit. This he further illustrates, by a similitude taken from <HI>Musical Instruments,</HI> the one used in <HI>peace, viz.</HI> the <HI>Harp;</HI> the other in <HI>war, viz.</HI> the <HI>Trumpet;</HI> telli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g them, that as 'tis ordinarily seen in the world, if the <HI>Harp</HI> sound something n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t understood, a man cannot apply himself to the dance; or if the <HI>Trumpet</HI> give not such a sound as is understood, a man cannot prepare himself to the Battle: so those that have the gift of a strange Tongue, if they do not utter words intelligible to the Auditors, they will nothing edifie them by what they say; their words will be only unprofi∣tably poured out into the air. There are, it may be, he tells them, as many Voices or Languages in the World, as there are Nations<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> sub∣audi <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>; so that none of them are without some Language<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> which they understand, and ordinarily no other. Now, says he, if he that hath any of these Languages, speaks to me in any Language but that which I understand, and I speak to him also in a Language which he understands not, we shall be <HI>Barba∣rians</HI> one to another. Wherefore he exhorts them, that of all spiritual gifts, they would most earnestly desire the gift of <HI>Prophesie,</HI> for the good of the Church. And in order hereunto, he advises, that he that hath the gift of an unknown Tongue, should pray<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Precetur vel ut ipse vel ut alius interpretetur, quod locutus est, ut alii discant.</NOTE> that he may be inabled so to interpret that Tongue, that others may profit thereby. For, says he, if I pray in an unknown Tongue, my <HI>Spirit prayeth,</HI> that is, I make use of my gift which I my self understand, but that understanding of mine is no way use∣ful to others. I will tell you therefore what seems most desireable to me in this case, Namely, that if I pray by the gift of the Spirit in an unkn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn Tongue, I may add an interpretation, and so pray with <HI>under∣standing</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><P>I will pray with the Spirit, that is, with a strange Tongue mi∣nistred to me by the Spirit.</P>
<P>To pray <HI>with the understanding</HI> is to pray so as others may understand.</P></NOTE> also, <HI>that is,</HI> so as others, which hear, may understand; and if I sing praises to God by the gift of the Spirit, in an unknown Tongue, I may add an in∣terpretation that the hearers may understand and pro∣fit thereby. For else when any man shall bless God in an unknown Tongue by the gift of the Spirit, how shall ordinary persons in the Congregation give their consent, by saying <HI>Amen</HI> to what he says. For the hea∣rers (that cannot understand) are not edified, nor can go along with the thanks∣giving, though that which is spoken be v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcellent. He t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls them, he had the gift of Tongues in a larger measure than any of them (and he knew how to value that gift) yet he had rather speak a few words so as to express and in∣terpret his understanding and meaning to others, than many in a T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngue unknown to the people. In sum, he shews them, that a vain ostentation of things that tended not to profit, was but a childish thing. Indeed in innocency they should imitate little Children, but in <HI>understanding of things spiritual</HI> they should
<PB N="179" REF="99"/> approve themselves to be men. He farther shews, out of the <HI>Law,</HI> that is, the Scriptures of the Old Testament, <HI>(See Joh. 10.34.),</HI> and particularly out of <HI>Isa. 28.11.</HI> that because the people of <HI>Judah</HI> would not be instructed by the plain preaching of the Lords Prophets therefore he would cause them to be spo∣ken to in an unknown Language for a punishment of their unthankfulness and ob∣stinacy, that is, he would visit them with outlandish Enemies and Armies, whose Language they should not understand. So that strange Tongues, except they were interpreted, were not given for a sign of any good to Believers, but they were gi∣ven as a sign of Gods displeasure to unbelievers <HI>(f)</HI> in∣somuch that by the just judgment of God,<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Hinc vero Paulus rectè col∣ligit linguarum peregrinarum u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, ita ut eo utebantur Corinthii, signum esse destinatum non iis qui credunt sed infidelibus, i. e. <HI>maledictionis</HI> signum qua profanos Dominuus ulciscere∣tur non <HI>benedictionis</HI> quâ suos crudi∣ret. Non solent autem Apostoli anxiè syllabas numerare in citandis scri∣pturae testimoniis, &amp;c. vid. <HI>Bezam</HI> in loc.</NOTE> their ignorance by this means w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be the more increased. But the gift of <HI>Prophesie</HI> serveth not only for the <HI>conversion</HI> of un∣believers, but for the <HI>edification</HI> of Believers also. There∣fore Prophesie is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be preferr'd before Tongues. Moreover, when the Church meets together, if all that speak should speak in a strange Tongue, what will an ordinary man, or an unbeliever (coming into the Congregation) think or say? Will he not think them all mad? But if all that speak, do Prophesie and interpret the Scripture, and open the Doctrine of Christ to the edification of the Church; in such a case, if an un∣believer come in, he is convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of sin, and condemned according to the sentence of the Law, by all those that Prophesie, and the secret sins of his heart are made manifest unto him, and so falling d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn he will adore God, and seriously give testi∣mony to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds presence with the Prophets of the Church. Therefore Prophesie is more excellent than the gift of Tongues. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 26.</HI></P>
<P>He now comes to give several precepts concerning <HI>good order</HI> in the Church, and particularly to prescribe certain rules which they should observe as to the use of gifts. And first says he, when y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u come together, hath any of you a <HI>Psalm</HI> or <HI>Hymn</HI> suggested to him by the Spirit, to the glory of God and the edification of the Church? or hath any one of you a <HI>Doctrine,</HI> a particular instruction, or matter of consolati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n inspired into him by the spirit? or hath be a <HI>strange Tongue;</HI> or the gift of interpreting into the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, what another spake in a strange Tongue, (p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssibly the <HI>Hebrew</HI>)? Let it be how it will, he exhorts, that all be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne so as may most tend to the benefit and edification of the Church. His s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Precept is, that those that were inabled with the gift of Tongues should not speak in one and the <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Assembly,</HI> one h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re and another there, to the confusion of the Company, that no more than <HI>three</HI> should speak at one time, and that n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t together, but by course one after another, and that too, when there was an Interpreter present, (whō could explain in the vulgar Tongue, what they said) otherwise he that had the strange Tongue sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be silent in the Church, and keep his Tongue to himself, and use it at home betwixt God and himself in private prayer. And accordingly he directs concerning those that <HI>prophesied,</HI> to wit, that only two or three of them sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld Prophesie at one meeting, and that the other Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phets should judg and examine their Doctrine by the rule of the Word. Yet if any Prophet who sate by, desired to be heard, (while the other was speak∣ing), in order to the opening s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me difficulty then before them, the Apostle orders that they should permit him so to do, and that the other that was speaking should be silent. For all the Prophets that were extraordinarily inspired by the Spirit were to be heard, (provided order was duly observed therein), that so the knowledg and consolation of the whole Church might be ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by promoted. And he tells them, the Spirits of the Prophets, that is, the Doctrines which the Prophets bring, are to be judged and examined<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">We are com∣manded <HI>to try the Spirits,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.1.</NOTE> by the other Prophets, whether they be agree∣able to the word of God or no. And these rules be exhorts them diligently to ob∣serve, lest a tumult, and confusion should arise among them, which is hateful to God, who requires that peace should be kept, and maintained in all the Churches of his Saints. <HI>From Ver. 26. to 34.</HI></P>
<PB N="180" REF="100"/>
<P>And for the further carrying on of <HI>good order</HI> among them, he forbids that <HI>Women</HI> should speak publickly, or propound any Questions in the Church, because subjection is appointed by the word of God for that sex <HI>[Gen. 3.16.],</HI> of which <HI>silence</HI> is a token. And therefore they should learn privately at home of their own husbands, and seek instructions from them in the things they doubted of. He further shews, that if any of their high-crested Doctors, or others among them, will not submit to these Precepts, but take upon them to order otherwise, and to suffer Women to speak in the Congregation, contrary to all other Churches, they should consider that they are not the first Church, that was planted from which the Gospel came forth to other places, as it did from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> nor were they the on∣ly persons to whom the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel was sent, that they should take upon them to Judge of order and decency, and therein to differ from all other Churches. He affirms that these Precepts he hath given them are from the Lord, and commands that those who esteem themselves Prophets, and persons that have any spiritual gift or <HI>afflation,</HI> should acknowledg them to be divine. And for others that affect to be ignorant, he leaves them to be ignorant at their own peril. In fine, he exhorts them, earnestly to endeavour after the gift of Prophesying; and for the gift of Tongues, that they that have it should be allowed the use of it, provided they observed the rules by him before given. And that in their publick Assemblies for religious worship, all things should be performed with <HI>gravity</HI> and <HI>decency,</HI> as may most conduce to the glory of God, and the edification of the Church. <HI>From Ver. 34. to the end.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="Chap."/> He comes now to assert the Doctrine of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> there being some, it seems, in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> at that time that denied it. And first by way of Introduction, he recites the <HI>sum</HI> of the Gospel which he had preached to them, which they had embraced; and in the profession whereof, the greatest part of them had hitherto stood stedfast, and by which, he tells them, they shall be sa∣ved<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Praesens pro futuro.</NOTE>, if they faithfully retain and observe it, as he delivered<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">i. e.

He tells them, that he delivered unto them what he had received of <HI>Ananias,</HI> and the Apostles, and by special revelation from Christ himself <HI>[Gal. 1.12. 1 Cor. 11.23.]</HI> namely, that Christ the true <HI>Messias</HI> died to make atonement for our sins, as <HI>Esay</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> had foretold in the Old Testament, <HI>[viz.

<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Having promised these things, He comes now to refute the Error of those that denied the Resurrection, shewing the absurdity of it in <HI>six particulars. 1.</HI> If there be no Resurr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of the dead, then Christ the <HI>Head</HI> is not risen.

Not that he shall cease to reign with his Father, (for in that sense, <HI>Of his Kingdom there shall be no end</HI>), but he shall cease to reign as <HI>Mediator,</HI> and as deputed by his Father. Yet he must reign as <HI>Me∣diator</HI> till he have subdued all his Enemies, whereof <HI>death</HI> will he the last; and death being subdued, the resurrection must needs follow. Now that all enemies shall be subdued under him, the Apostle manifests, because God the Father hath promised that <HI>all things shall be subject unto him [Psal. 8.6. Eph. 1.22. Heb. 2.8.],</HI> yet we are always to suppose, that he hath not thereby devested him∣self of his <HI>Soveraign Empire,</HI> but under the word <HI>All,</HI> He himself is excepted, who hath subjected all things else to his Son. And when all things shall be thus subdued to Christ, and his Mediatory Kingdom delivered up to his Father, then the Son himself, as <HI>Mediator</HI> and <HI>Head</HI> of his Church, <HI>[See 1 Cor. 12.12. Eph. 1.12.],</HI> shall he subject unto him. And then shall God the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> fill all the Saints with glory and bliss eternally and <HI>imme∣diately,</HI> whereas now He conveys himself to them by <HI>means.

He advises there∣fore such among them, as were sleeping in their ignorance and sottish security, to rouze up themselves, and to awake
<PB N="183" REF="101"/> to <HI>righteousness, viz.</HI> to live righteously, and to avoid <HI>Epicurism,</HI> and the company of <HI>Epicures.</HI> For he tells them, there were some such among them, which had not the right knowledg of the true God, which he spake to their shame. <HI>From Ver. 29. to 35.</HI></P>
<P>He now comes to answer three Objections against this Doctrine.</P>
<P><HI>Object. 1.</HI> It seems impossible the dead should arise. For, <HI>How shall it be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object. 2. Who can describe with what bodies they shall arise?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object. 3. What shall become of those that are alive at the Coming of Christ?</HI> For they are not capable of a Resurrection who never died.</P>
<P>To the <HI>first</HI> he answers, that 'tis as possible for the Body to rise again, as for <HI>Corn sown</HI> to be quickned after it dies in the earth.</P>
<P>To the <HI>second,</HI> he says, that our Bodies shall arise the <HI>same in substance,</HI> but not <HI>in qualities.</HI> They shall rise with far more excellent qualities, than those they were buried with. As a bare grain of Corn that is sown, is raised in substance and kind the <HI>same,</HI> but <HI>diverse</HI> in qualities, coming up with <HI>blade,</HI> and <HI>ear,</HI> and <HI>corn</HI> in it: It does not rise in the same figure in which it was sown. Seeds are sown and <HI>rot,</HI> yet notwithstanding they are so far from perishing there∣by, that they rise up far more beautiful; and whereas they are sown <HI>dry</HI> and <HI>hard,</HI> they spring up <HI>green</HI> and <HI>fresh:</HI> So why should it seem incredible, that our Bodies should arise from corruption, and yet with far more excellent qualities than they had before? And as there are several kinds of <HI>flesh,</HI> and one more excellent than another; and as <HI>celestial</HI> Bodies, are more glorious than <HI>terrestrial,</HI> and one celestial Body differs from another in glory; so it will be in the Resurrection. The Bodies that rise, will differ from those that dyed. That which was here a corruptible Body, when it rises, will be an incorruptible. The Body that was here obnoxious, and exposed to diseases, griefs, and death, will be raised glorious and strong, beautiful and shining, like unto the Stars, and the Sun in the Hea∣vens <HI>[Math. 13, 43. &amp; 17 2.].</HI> That which was sown a <HI>natural</HI> or an <HI>ani∣mal</HI> Body, which needed here to be supported, as other animals are, with meat, and drink, and such things as afforded nourishment to it, shall be raised a <HI>spi∣ritual</HI> Body, endued with spiritual qualities, not needing meat, or nourishment, but shall be supported immediately by the Spirit of God without means, as the Angels in Heaven are, <HI>Math. 22.30.</HI> So that there are Bodies of <HI>both these sorts,</HI> which much differ one from the other. And as from the <HI>first Adam,</HI> (according to <HI>Gen. 2.7.</HI>) we received a <HI>natural,</HI> or <HI>animal</HI> Body, which yet could not be continued in life without nourishment; so by the <HI>second Adam,</HI> name∣ly <HI>Christ,</HI> we shall obtain a <HI>spiritual</HI> Body in the Resurrection, which he will sustain without nourishment by his Spirit, He being a <HI>quickning Spirit</HI> And as since the Resurrection, Christ hath a <HI>spiritual</HI> Body, which is immortal and incorruptible; so shall he also give <HI>such Bodies</HI> to those that are <HI>his.</HI> Yet all things must be done in order; we must have a natural Body first, and a spiritual Body after, as that which is perfect follows upon that which is imperfect. The <HI>first Man</HI> is of the earth, <HI>earthly,</HI> and therefore could communicate nothing but a <HI>terrene</HI> life. But the <HI>second Man,</HI> is not only <HI>man,</HI> but <HI>God</HI> from Heaven also, and therefore could support his own Body, that it should not see corruption (though in its own nature terrene and resoluble into dust); and having raised it out of the grave he could make it glorious, immortal, and heavenly, not need∣ing
<PB N="184" REF="102"/> earthly supports. And so in like manner can he make our Bodies also. Such a Body as <HI>Adam</HI> himself had, such have all we, (who d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scended from him in a natural way), as long as we are upon the earth. And such a Body as Christ now hath (namely, glorified, immortal, and incorruptible,) shall <HI>Believers</HI> have, after they shall be raised from the dead, and shall be taken up into Heaven. And as here we are conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmable to the <HI>first Adam,</HI> in <HI>mortality</HI> and <HI>corruptibility;</HI> so shall we hereafter be conformable to Christ in glory and immortality. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r our Bodies, as now they are, cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, unless they be first fitted f r that glori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us state, by the mutation of their qualiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and be chan∣ged, purified, and immortalized. <HI>From Ver. 35. to 51.</HI></P>
<P>He now answers the <HI>third</HI> Objecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, namely, <HI>What shall become of those who shall be found alive at Christs coming?</HI> As f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r those, he tells them, they shall not <HI>dye,</HI> but shall be <HI>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nged,</HI> and of mortal sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll become immortal, and that in a moment, when both all that are dead, and all that are alive shall be summoned by the last Trumpet to Christs Tribunal. And when this is done, then that triumphant speech of the Prophet <HI>Hosea</HI> shall be ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed, <HI>chap. 13.14, O death, I will be thy plagues! O grave, I will be thy d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>struction!</HI> that is, Death shall be destroyed for ever, and shall never rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver strength again over any man. And that this Victory may appear the greater, he shews, that the <HI>sting of death is sin,</HI> and the strength of sin, <HI>is the Law,</HI> that is, Ʋnless <HI>satisfaction</HI> be given to the Law, <HI>sin, wrath,</HI> and <HI>death</HI> remain in full force and power. But after satisfaction is made to the Law for us, <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>wrath</HI> are taken away, and <HI>death</HI> is disarmed of its sting. From the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le that he hath said, he infers two things; <HI>1.</HI> That God should be highly praised, who hath <HI>through Christ</HI> given us Victory over <HI>Sin, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath,</HI> and the <HI>Law. 2.</HI> That we sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld he <HI>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dfast</HI> and <HI>unmoveable</HI> in the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel, and in do∣ing and suffering the will of God, being assured there will be a <HI>Resurrection,</HI> at which our labour will be recompensed and graciously rewarded. <HI>From Ver. 51. to the end.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="Chap."/> He shuts up the whole Epistle, giving some directions concerning their colle∣ction f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Saints at <HI>Jerusalem, how</HI> and in <HI>what manner</HI> it should be made, and <HI>how</HI> sent.

And he tells them, that when he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes, they shall chuse the <HI>Messengers</HI> who shall carry their contribution, that they may be sure of the due disposing of it, according to their own intentions.

<P>He tells them, he designed to come to them, assoon as he had spent some time in the several parts of <HI>Macedonia.</HI> For he intended to remove from <HI>Ephesus</HI> where he now was, and to go to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> through that Region. And perhaps he would stay the whole Winter with them, which being done, he supposed some of them would go some part of the way with him. And ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore he would not now come to them, and only see them as it were in passing. For if he did s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he should not be able to stay; whereas his purpose was, (with the Lords leave) to spend some time with them, when he next came. At present he pur∣posed to stay at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> till <HI>Pentecost,</HI> because God had opened a great door, and opportunity to him for the gaining of many to Christ, and had abundantly blessed his labours. Yet there were many adversaries in that place, that oppos'd the truth, which made his presence requisite for some time longer; For Satan and his instruments in his absence did much harm. <HI>From Ver. 5. to 10.</HI></P>
<PB N="185" REF="102"/>
<P>He charges them that if <HI>Timothy</HI> come to them, they should take care of his safety among them, and that they would look upon him as they would on <HI>hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f,</HI> because of his faithfulness in the ministerial work, and that they would treat him him respectfully and bring him on in his journey, when he returned, that he might come safely to him; for he and the Brethren expected him. <HI>Ver. 10, 11.</HI></P>
<P>He acquaints them that <HI>Apollos</HI> was not willing at present for some reasons to come to them, possibly because he would not countenance a Faction there begun under his name <HI>[1 Cor. 1.12.]. Ver. 12.</HI></P>
<P>He exhorts them, to <HI>watchfulness, stedfastness in the Faith, Christian courage,</HI> and <HI>Fortitude,</HI> and that putting away <HI>Schisms</HI> and <HI>Division,</HI> they they would make <HI>Charity</HI> the <HI>Arbitrator</HI> of all things among them. <HI>Ver. 13, 14.</HI></P>
<P>He makes honourable mention of <HI>Stephanas</HI> and his Family, as those that re∣ceived the Gospel at the first preaching of it in <HI>Achaia,</HI> and first gave their Names to Christ, and have since addict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d themselves to the ministry of the Saints, being very serviceable and bountiful to them on all occasions.

<P>He tells them, he was glad of the coming of <HI>Stephanas, Fortunatus,</HI> and <HI>A∣chaicus</HI> unto him, who had acquainted him with the <HI>Schisms</HI> among them, and all other matters of importance, and so had done that which they themselves ought to have done. He tells them, <HI>they</HI> had much refreshed his Spirit, by acquainting him, that there were so many yet among them that adhered to the truth; and <HI>they</HI> had (he supposed) refreshed <HI>their</HI> Spirits, by sending them word of the conti∣nuance of his great affection towards them. He would have persons of such in∣tegrity as they were, much esteemed among them. <HI>Ver. 17, 18.</HI></P>
<P>He comes now to the Conclusion of his Epistle, wherein he sends several saluta∣tions unto them from the Churches of <HI>Asia;</HI> from <HI>Aquila</HI> and <HI>Priscilla,</HI> and all the Christians in their Family, who wish'd them all spiritual blessings from Christ. He wills them to salute one another with the kiss of Peace and Charity, with which <HI>Believers</HI> (according to the custom of those Countries and times) used to salute one another. He adds his own salutation with his own hand, the rest of the Epistle being written by some Scribe, <HI>See 2 Thes. 3.17.</HI> He adds also one remarkable <HI>sentence</HI> with his own hand, which he would have them especially to take notice of, and re∣member, (as <HI>Augustus</HI> used to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when he wrote to the Governours of Provinces) namely this, <HI>If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> (that is, be a <HI>se∣cret</HI> or <HI>open</HI> opposer of him and his Gospel), <HI>let him be accursed: Maranatha,</HI> the Lord cometh.

And out of their ill will towards him, they interpreted all his <HI>sayings</HI> and <HI>doings</HI> to the worst sense. He had promised in the latter end of his former Epistle to come to them shortly. But for certain reasons he did yet forbear to come. This they in∣terpreted as an argument of <HI>levity</HI> in him.

These and such like Calumnies of theirs, the Apostle sets himself to refute in this Epistle: yet notwithstanding all this, he professes his sincere love to them; but being forced to it by his Adversaries, he resolves to vindicate himself and his Apostolick authority from their contempt.</P>

</LIST>
<P>THE <HI>Preface</HI> contains the Direction of the Epistle to the Church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and to all the <HI>Saints,</HI> and Churches in <HI>Achaia,</HI> and his Apostolical saluta∣tion and benediction. <HI>Ver. 1, 2.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Body of the Epistle</HI> consists of <HI>three</HI> parts. In the <HI>1st.</HI> He apologizes for himself in the <HI>five</HI> first Chapters.</P>
<P>In the <HI>2d.</HI> He exhorts the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to sundry duties. <HI>Chap. 6, 7, 8, 9.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>3d,</HI> He vindicates his own Authority and Doctrine. <HI>Chap. 10, 11, 12, and to the 11th. ver. of Chap. 13.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>first part,</HI> we may observe these particulars.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> Lest any of them should be offended at his many afflictions and troubles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first part of the Epistle.</NOTE> and be tempted to think (as worldlings use to be), that if he were a faithful Servant of God, he would not suffer him to be so extremely afflicted. He there∣upon begins his Epistle with solemn thanksgiving to God, for the comforts he afford∣ed him in those his trials, that so he might by his own experience be able to com∣fort others that were in the like condition. For though his sufferings for Christ were many, yet his <HI>consolations</HI> from Christ were many also. And he tells them, that whe∣ther he was <HI>afflict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> it tended to their consolation and salvation, which is to be wrought out by a patient and christian enduring such kind of afflictions as he endured, when they are called to it: or whether he was <HI>comforted,</HI> it tended also to their consolation and salvation; who by his example, might learn willingly to undergo afflicti∣ons for Christ, that they might also partake of his consolations. And he had a stedfast and firm hope concerning several of them, that they did sympathize with him in his suf∣ferings, and accordingly should partake with him in his comforts. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 8.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He clears himself of some <HI>aspersions</HI> cast on him by <HI>false Teachers.</HI> As first of <HI>levity</HI> in not coming to them according to his promise made, <HI>1 Cor. 4.19. &amp; 1 Cor. 16. from 2. to 8.</HI> And secondly of too much <HI>rigor</HI> towards the <HI>ince∣stuous</HI> person.</P>
<P>To the <HI>first,</HI> he answers, that he was hindred by that affliction he met with in <HI>Asia, viz.</HI> at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> that was so great, that he even despaired of life. The history of which, (as s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me conceive), we have <HI>Act. 19.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Videntur indicari illa pericula de quibus Act. 20.19. <HI>Grot. Cajeta∣nus</HI> putat hujus tribulationis nusquam alibi in Scripturâ fieri mentionem.</NOTE>, where 'tis intimated in what extreme danger his life was, so that he had no humane means to escape it. Yet out of this danger God (who can deliver from imminent death <HI>those,</HI> that are ready to dye, and can, and will raise up those that are dead at the last day) delivered him, and he trusts will still deliver him out of all such dangers; they affording him the help of their prayers (which he earnestly desires) that so the mercy of such deliverances being bestowed through the prayers and intercessions of many, God may be glorified and praised by many for them. <HI>From Ver. 8. to 12.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2ly.</HI> He shews that the fairness and uprightness of his conversation, and espe∣cially among the <HI>Corinthians</HI> (among whom he had conversed a year and half, <HI>Act. 18.11.</HI>) might testifie for him, that he was not acted by fleshly wisdom or
<PB N="196" REF="108"/> dissimulation, but by the grace of God. Neither did he write<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>v.</HI> 13.

<P>And I write no other things to you concerning my uprightness and sin∣cerity than what ye read of me in the Epistles I have sent to you and other Churches, and which ye know of me, and I hope shall acknowledg the same unto the end.</P></NOTE> any thing to them that was disagreeable to his professed sincerity, but those things they here read, they cannot but acknowledg to be really so, and he hopes to the end they shall always acknowledg him to be the same. And as it was matter of rejoicing to <HI>them,</HI> that they were converted by <HI>him;</HI> so it was to <HI>him</HI> that he had <HI>gained them to Christ,</HI> and so he hoped to glory in them at the last day. And with this affection to them, and perswasion of their kindness to him, he design<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to come unto them, that they might have a second benefit by him; and be con∣firmed at his second coming, as they were converted at his first, and that he might receive offices of kindness and friendship from them. And therefore he did not make promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>lightly</HI> and <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shly</HI> after the manner of <HI>car∣nal</HI> men, (promising wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they intend not t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perform), so that there should be<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Etiam</HI> justorum, est <HI>Etiam,</HI> &amp; eorum <HI>Non,</HI> est <HI>Non.</HI></NOTE> <HI>yea</HI> and <HI>nay</HI> with him, that is, <HI>saying</HI> and not <HI>do∣ing</HI> concerning the same things. For Christ Jesus whom he had preached among them, and whom <HI>he</HI> and <HI>they</HI> ought to imitate, was not inconstant and changeable in his Promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; but whatsoever is promised <HI>by him</HI> or <HI>of him,</HI> is certain and inva∣riable. For all the <HI>Promises</HI> of God, made in the Covenant of Grace, have their <HI>foundation, firm establishment,</HI> and <HI>unalterable ratification</HI> in the death of Jesus Christ, the <HI>Mediator</HI> and <HI>Surety</HI> thereof <HI>[Gal. 3.17. Heb. 9.15, 16, 17. &amp; Chap. 7.22.],</HI> and <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> him, are firm and stedfast, sure and certain; and <HI>he,</HI> and the other Apostles ought to declare the same in their ministry, to the glory of God. And he shews, that <HI>he</HI> that establishes and confirms both <HI>him</HI> and <HI>them</HI> in their Faith in Christ, is <HI>God alone,</HI> who hath anoint∣ed and consecrated <HI>them his Apostles</HI> to this high office of the Apostleship, by plentifully pouring forth upon them the <HI>gifts</HI> and <HI>graces</HI> of his Spirit, and there∣by fitting them for it; and by the Miracles he hath enabled them to work, hath set his Seal to their Doctrine; and by the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffable, and glorious joys of his Spi∣rit, wrought in their hearts, hath given them, as it were, an earnest and taste of their future happiness: And therefore surely such persons as <HI>they,</HI> are not to be accused of leightness and vanity. <HI>From Ver. 12. to 23.</HI></P>
<P>Further he solemnly professes, that his end <HI>in delaying</HI> to come to them, was to give <HI>some</HI> among them <HI>time</HI> to repent and reform, and that the <HI>disorders</HI> in their Church might be rectified by themselves, lest when he came, he should be compell'd to use more severity among them, than they could well bear. And this he spake, not as <HI>one</HI> that arrogated to himself a dominion over their <HI>Faith,</HI> (and designed to impose upon them in the matters that concern'd their souls, what he pleased), but as a <HI>minister</HI> and <HI>co-worker</HI> with Christ, to bring them to a right and due sense of their faults, and consequently to that true joy and comfort which follows upon true repentance and amendment; and so he should be a means to strengthen their <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, by <HI>which alone</HI> they <HI>stand in the favour of God,</HI> and obtain a <HI>right</HI> and <HI>title</HI> to the Kingdom of Heaven. <HI>From Ver. 23, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He comes now in the second place, to vindicate himself from the aspersions of <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Chap."/> too much <HI>rigor</HI> towards the <HI>incestuous</HI> person. In order to which, he tells them, that he had no mind to come to them in such a manner, that his coming should bring sadness, and heaviness to them, by reason of the severity he should be neces∣sitated to use towards the reforming of the evil manners among them. For if he was forc'd upon such an occasion to grieve them, nothing could comfort him so much, as the <HI>amendment of the person</HI> against <HI>whom</HI> he was forc'd to use severity. And concerning this thing, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>amending</HI> of the faults among them, he had written to them in his former Epistle <HI>[chap. 5.],</HI> lest if he should
<PB N="197" REF="108"/> come to them, and find any scandalous unreform'd persons among them, besides his sorrow for their sin, he should be forced to a new sorrow, which necessary severity would create both to them and himself: And he was confide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that they rather desired he should find matter of joy among them, by the removal of such offences, than matter of sorrow, by continuing of them. He professes, that what he wrote in his former Epistle concerning the incestuous person, was not written with any inten∣tion to grieve them, but out of his great and abundant love to them, which could not endure that they should make themselves guilty of such faults. He tells them, that the <HI>incestuous</HI> person's sin, had not so wholly grieved him, as if they were <HI>all</HI> offenders with him; for since he had proof of their obedience in their excommuni∣cating of him, he did sorrow but in part, only for his sake who was guilty, not for them all, they having cleared themselves, that they were no upholders or main∣tainers of him in his sin. And that it might appear that his former severity pro∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded not from any other principle then <HI>love,</HI> and a desire of good to the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> he declares, that the <HI>censure</HI> and chastizement inflicted on this <HI>in∣cestuous</HI> person by the authority of many (that is, the Governours of the Church, the Church it self consenting) <HI>seeing he had manifested his repentance,</HI> was sufficient. And sherefore he adviseth, that he be received into favour again, be∣cause they were bound to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgive and comfort him now, as well as they were bound to excommunicate him before; and this they ought the rather to do, lest if they should not, he sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be swallowed up of over-much sorrow. Where∣fore he exhorts them, to <HI>confirm</HI> their love towards him, by shewing, that by excommunicating him they did not intend to destroy him, but to save him, by bringing him to repentance. And for this end he had now written to them, to see whether they would be as obedient to his directions and appointments, in <HI>ab∣solving</HI> of penitents, as in afflicting Church-censures on offendors. He tells them, that whom they were willing to forgive and restore from excommunication (being satisfied of their repentance), he was willing also to forgive, as one present in spirit with them, <HI>see 1 Cor. 5.</HI> And if in the beginning of the Church, before the orderly go∣vernment of it was setled, he <HI>alone</HI> had received some repenting sinners to mercy; he d d it, not out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f ambition, but with regard to them, to give them an exam∣ple of shewing <HI>lenity</HI> as well as <HI>severity;</HI> and with respect to the person of Christ, that he might keep people stedfast in the Faith of Christ; and that S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tan might not get an advantage against any of them; who sometimes by too great slackness of Ecclesiastical discipline s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eks to lull sinners asleep, and sometimes by too great seve∣rity endeavours to drive them to despair. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 12.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> He shews, he was so far from wanting any true affection to them, that when he came to <HI>Troas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Act. 20.6. 1 Tim. 4.13.</NOTE>, though a door<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">See 1 Cor. 16.9.</NOTE> was opened to him by the Lord for the preaching of the Gospel in that place, yet he had no rest in his spirit because he found not <HI>Titus</HI> there, to inform him of their state; and in pursuit of him he left that City, and went into <HI>Macedonia,</HI> in hope that he might find him there, and having met with him he understood by him the happy success of his former Epistle, and that caused him to bless God exceedingly, who had hitherto so graciously prospered him in his ministry, and had given him and his fellow-Apo∣stles such a victory and conquest in every place, (where they came to preach the word) by the conversion of so many, and had spread the sweet odour or savour of the Gospel by their preaching up and down in the world. And (says he) we spread this sweet savour of Christ, (to the honour and glory of God), both among such as are thereby brought to repent and believe, and among such as re∣main impenitent and unbelievers. To the <HI>one,</HI> the Gospel is the most comfortable vital savour that ever came to them, and a ministry of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8.</NOTE>, and the power of God unto their Salvation; but to the <HI>other,</HI> by accident, 'tis a savour of death<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Odor mortis in mortem, i. e. odor mortifer, mortem afferens: O∣dor vitae in vitam, i. e. Odor vitalis, vitam afferens.</NOTE> and aggravates their condemnation. And the preaching of this glorious Gospel, he shews, is a weighty imployment, and no man is sufficient of himself for it. Lastly, he declares, that he was no corrupter of the Word, as many <HI>false Teachers</HI> were, who mixed their own
<PB N="198" REF="109"/> passi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns of pride or covetousness with the true Doctrine they preached; but he preach∣ed it out of uprightness and sincerity, as one taught of God, and who eyed God in what he did, and was acted by the power, and guided by the Spirit of Christ. <HI>From Ver. 12. to the end.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Chap."/> <HI>4ly.</HI> He shews it was not requisite he should go about to commend the fidelity of his ministry, especially to them, considering they had been converted by it; and therefore he needed not <HI>Letters commendatory</HI> to them (or from them to others) such as the <HI>false Teachers</HI> possibly strove to commend themselves by; for <HI>they themselves</HI> were his<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Ego Evangelium vestris in∣scripsi animis. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> Epistle of commendation, given as it were by God to him, affording him a clear Testimony of the soundness of his Doctrine, and the efficaciousness of his Ministry, by their conversion; which Testimony being written in their hearts<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Legendum puto <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> cordibus vestris, collatione versiculi tertii &amp; ex re ipsâ. <HI>Pisc.</HI></NOTE>, and openly appearing in their Christian conversation, was legible to other Churches, and accordingly acknowledged by them: yet he would not say, they were so much his Epistle, as the Epistle of Christ, Christ himself having writ∣ten his Will and Law on their hearts, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, after a more excellent manner than any thing was wont to be written with Ink upon Paper; and <HI>he</HI> and <HI>Timothy</HI> were only the Pen or Instruments of the Spirit in this writing<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Their Faith was the work of the Spirit, though, wrought by <HI>his</HI> Ministry.</NOTE>. And they had still a great confidence of being further instrumental in this way, and of the acceptance of their endeavours with God, through Christ enabling of them. Not that they were able by any natural wisdom of their own, to think or contrive any thing that was fit to convert the hearts of men; but their <HI>sufficiency</HI> was <HI>Gods assistance,</HI> who had made them fit or meet to be Ministers of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> which is ac∣companied with the efficacious operation of the Spirit, and not of the <HI>Old Testa∣ment</HI> which literally declared what was to be done, but gave no spiritual ability for the doing and performing of it. For the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> or <HI>old dispensa∣tion</HI> of the Covenant of Grace (call'd here the <HI>Letter</HI>), though it shaddow'd out the way to life, yet conferred not on faln man any power to perform what is required thereunto, but convinced him of sin, and consequently that he was wor∣thy of death<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 6. Litera occîdit, i. e. convincit hominem quod sit aeter∣nae morti obnoxius. Rom. 7.10.</NOTE>, which is threatned to transgressors. But the <HI>New Testament,</HI> or G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel, doth not only clearly shew the way to life and salvation by Faith in Christ Je∣sus, but is also accompanied with the power of the Holy Ghost, whereby that <HI>Faith</HI> is wrought, and whereby the Soul is raised up, and quickened from the death of sin. Now if the Old Testament which was a ministration of death, and was written in Letters, and engraven in Stones, (as to some part of it, to wit, the Ten Commandments), was so glo∣rious, as was signified by the splendor of <HI>Moses</HI>'s face, which the Children of Israel could not stedfastly behold when he came down from the Mount<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Exod.</HI> 34:40.</NOTE>; which Ministration was yet to be done away, (as far forth as it was opposite to the Gospel-dispensation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Abolitionem legis, cujus hic fit mentio, interpretor de toto Veteri Testamento, quatenus Evangelio op∣ponitur. <HI>Calv.</HI></NOTE>): How much more glorious is the Ministration of the New Testament, which is accompanied with the quickning Spirit of God? If the Ministration of Condemnation were glorious, how much shall the Ministra∣tion of Righteousness and Justification excell in glory? So that the former, though in it self glorious, yet when compared with the latter, hath, as it were, no glory; it is so far out-shin'd by it: and if that Admini∣stration which was to be abolished was glorious, surely that which is to continue is much more glorious. From hence he infers, that seeing himself and the other Apostles had such hope that their Ministry should be accepted and owned by God, they used the greater boldness in publishing the Gospel; and did not imitate <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> who veiled his face, which was a sign of the obscurity of the <HI>Legal Admi∣nistration,</HI> and of the blindness of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who could not see the <HI>end</HI> and
<PB N="199" REF="109"/> <HI>scope</HI> of that which was to be abolished, but generally rested in the <HI>outward letter</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">Volunt vitam aeternam per legem, quae nullibi in lege promissa est. <HI>Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>, and apprehended not the mysteries hid under those shaddows, and to this day, the <HI>veil</HI> remained upon their hearts <HI>untaken away,</HI> in the reading of the Old Testament. But in the New Testament, by the clear Doctrine of Christ, <HI>this cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring</HI> or <HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il</HI> is done away. Nevertheless, when their hearts shall be turned to the Lord, and shall own Christ, then the veil shall be done away as to them also, and they shall clearly see and understand what is now hid from them. For Christ is that quickning Spirit who takes away the veil and pow∣erfully changes the heart; and where his Spirit powerfully works, there is liberty and freedom from the yoke of the legal Administration, and from slavery to sin. And as <HI>Moses</HI> when he went to appear before the Lord put away the covering from his face, and by his converse with God his face became more and more shining and glorious, so (says he) all we who have received the Spirit of the Lord, do with open face, without any veil or covering, clearly behold the glorious Attributes of God, and the glorious manifestations of his grace, mercy, and wisdom shining in the face of Jesus Christ, (as in a <HI>mirror</HI> or <HI>glass</HI>), and thereby are trans∣formed into his Image, and are made like to him in the glory of holiness and grace, growing from one glorious measure and degree of it to another, through the operation of his Holy Spirit. <HI>From Ver. 1. to the end.</HI></P>

He declares that he had renounced ambition and covetousness (which some secretly allowed themselves in), and that he did not was walk craftily, nor handle the word of God<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Dolo tractant verbum Dei qui hominibus placent, aut partem veri tacent, aut falsa admiscent. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> deceitfully, so as to accommodate it to the corrupt humors and dispositions of men; but he preached the truth sincerely, and endeavour'd to approve himself to the Consciences of all those, who would judg <HI>understandingly</HI> and <HI>uprightly.</HI> He tells them, If the Gospel so clearly preached, be not understood by many <HI>worldly wise</HI> men, that is no argument of the obscurity of it; but of the incredulity of the hearers, who are blinded by the Devil, whom the world generally serves, and who (by the just judgment of God) hath got such a dominion over multitudes, that they serve him as their God<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Sic vocatus tum à suberbiâ quae sibi arrogat honorem Dei, &amp; vult a∣dorari ut Deus; tum à potentiâ quia haec obtinet in reprobis, qui sunt ma∣jor pars seculi, <HI>Zanch.</HI> Vide Joh. 12.31.

He further manifests his fidelity, by shewing them, he sought to advance the glory of Christ in his preach∣ing, and not himself, acknowledging himself a servant to Christ, and to his people for the promoting of Christs interest in them. For he humbly acknowledges, that God, who at first by his omnipotent word produced light out of darkness, by no less efficacy and power brought him (a lost sinner) out of the darkness of <HI>Pha∣risaism</HI> and <HI>sin,</HI> and shined into his heart with his glorious light, to the intent that he should communicate and impart this divine light of the knowledg of God, which shineth in the face or person of Jesus Christ, unto others. 'Tis true, the glory of God shon once in the face of <HI>Moses,</HI> but that was covered and veiled: But it shines much more gloriously now in the face of Christ, and is not covered to us. As a man sees the Fathers countenance in the face of his Son; so God represents himself most lively, sweetly, and savingly in Jesus Christ, But he tells them, that himself and his fellow-Apostles, (who were intrusted with this rich treasure of the Gospel) were but <HI>earthen Vessels,</HI> frail and contemptible, and exposed to

For here (says he) we live by <HI>Faith</HI> only, and cannot attain to <HI>sight</HI> and <HI>fruition</HI> till we come to Heaven. And hence it is, that we bear up with so much courage against the fear of death, being willing rather to go out of this Bo∣dy, and dye, that by this means we may come to our home, to enjoy the blissfull presence of God in Heaven, than to continue in the Body and be deprived of that happiness. So that all our ambition and design is this, that whether we continue in this mortal Body, or go out of it; whether we live or dye, we may be accepted of God, and may come at last to enjoy his blessed presence in Heaven. For we with full assurance expect a day of Judgment, at which all must appear, and at which every one shall receive according to their works<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] ea quae corpori ipsius, i. e. ipsi, debentur. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE>. And knowing the terribleness of that judgment, we do the more earnestly perswade men to come in to Christ, and to live as those that must be thus judged. But whether they would be perswaded or no, he tells them, the sincerity of his intention was manifested to God, and he hoped to their Consciences also. He shews, he speaks not these things to commend himself to them, but to furnish them how to answer the Ca∣lumnies that false Teachers brought against him, who gloried much <HI>outwardly,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut knew in their hearts and Consciences they had little reason so to do. And if I seem mad, says he, in thus comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding my ministry and sincerity unto you, I aim at G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds glory therein, (that the Gospel may not be undervalued), and not to arrogate to my self any thing. And on the other side, if I write and speak only that which you must needs account <HI>sober,</HI> it is for your good and edification. For the love of Christ constrains me to be faithful to him, and to refer all to his honour and praise, seeing he so loved us, as to lay down his life for us, when we were all dead in respect of the desert of our sins, and the claim of divine justice: And he hath done it, that all that are deliver'd from deserved perdition; through faith in his blood, should not live to themselves, but to the honour and praise of their Redeemer. And for his own part, he professes, he was so highly affected with this great redemption wrought by Christ, that he could not value any man, or esteem him happy, meerly for the outward advantages of this world, <HI>viz.</HI> for his <HI>wisdom, riches, learning, &amp;c.</HI> except he had a share in this Redemption. And if he himself formerly hath had carnal and earthly thoughts and hopes of Christ (as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny of the other <HI>Jews</HI> had) expecting that he should begin an earthly temporal Kingdom among them, wherein they should enjoy all outward prosperity, yet now he should know him so no more, but put off all such carnal imaginations of his Kingdom. For his Kingdom (he tells them) was of another nature, and <HI>whosoever is in him,</HI> (not <HI>externally</HI> only, by outward profes∣sion, but is really inserted and implanted into him by Faith, and made a member of that mystical body whereof he is the head), is renewed by his Spirit, and receives life, influence, and direction from him, and is thereby effectually chang'd, and made
<PB N="202" REF="111"/> a <HI>new creature,</HI> as to his <HI>principles, affections,</HI> and <HI>practises.</HI> And he shews, that <HI>all these things</HI> that concern the <HI>new creature,</HI> or the renovation of man, depend on G d as the Author of them, who of his <HI>free grace</HI> reconciles sinners to himself, by the death of his Son, and hath committed to them, his Apostles, the ministry of reconciliation, giving them commission to declare, that God was <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> the merits and <HI>intercession</HI> of his Son, ready to be reconciled to all those, both among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that truly believe in him; and upon their Faith in him, he did actually pardon them, not imputing their trespasses to them. And he had intrusted them, his Apostles, to publish the same in his name. And ac∣cordingly, as <HI>Ambassadors</HI> for Christ, and as sent from God on this great Message, they most affectionately besought sinners to accept of the reconciliation offered by God <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through Christ Jesus;</HI> who being an innocent, pure, and sinless person, God sent into the world to offer up himself a Sacrifice for our sins <HI>[Lev. 7.2.],</HI> that we by <HI>Faith</HI> resting on him, might be made fully righteous, with such a righteousness as God approves, and accepts, and for which he is pleased to justifie us. <HI>From Ver. 1. to the end.</HI></P>

They seemed sad indeed sometimes under the evils that oppressed them, but yet rejoiced in spirit, and had the inward testimony of their Conscience, and the comforts of the Holy Ghost to support them: They were poor in respect of worldly things, yet enriched many with spiritual riches.

And these things he spake for his own vindication, not to reproach them: for he had such an affection for them, that he could be content (if God saw it good) even to live and dye with them. And though he spake freely of their faults to themselves, yet he gloried of them to others, and was exceedingly comforted in the midst of all his afflictions, by the report he heard of their repentance. He shews, that when he was come from <HI>Ephesus</HI> into <HI>Macedonia, [Act. 20.1.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Sect. 13 of Ch. 6.</NOTE>], though he met with great opposi∣tions from some there, yet the fears he had concerning them were very trouble∣som to him. But he was exceedingly comforted by the coming of <HI>Titus;</HI> and it was not his bare presence that was so much a comfort to him, as the news that he brought, (with which he himself was also much comforted), <HI>viz.</HI> the news of their earnest desire to see him, their mourning for the sins he had in his former Epistle charged them with, and their zeal to defend him against his Calum∣niators, the false Teachers. And though in his former Epistle he had writ∣ten something sharply to them, by reason of their many enormities, yet he did not now repent of it, though 'tis true he was once sorry he had done it, lest such as were innocent among them should think themselves struck-at, in those his repre∣hensions. But though that Epistle did for a while grieve them, yet now he was glad he had written it, not meerly because he had grieved them, but because it had brought them to a Godly sorrow, for the evils that were among them, so that they received no damage at all, but much advantage thereby. For a right sense and sorrow for sin, wrought by the Spirit of God, worketh true repentance and reformation never to be repented of; whereas worldly sorrows, occasion'd only by
<PB N="204" REF="112"/> disgraces, or worldly losses or crosses, usually encreases sin and misery, and work∣eth diseases and death.

And as all things that he himself had spoken to them <HI>they</HI> found to be true, so all the good he had spoken of them to <HI>Titus, he</HI> by experience found to be true also.

As in the collection of <HI>Manna [Exod. 16.],</HI> God commanded that they which gathered more, than the prescribed measure, (which was an <HI>Omer</HI> for every single person) should give to him, who had gathered less; so God would have it, that they that have great riches should impart of their abundance, to them who are in want. <HI>7.</HI> He further excites them to this duty because several faithful Brethren were stirred up by God, and sent by him, not only to promote this collection, but also to carry it to the poor Saints in <HI>Judea;</HI> and he hopes they will not frustrate the expectation of such worthy persons; the first of whom was <HI>Titus,</HI> who took upon him to exhort and move them hereunto, and being very diligent, willingly travelled unto them.

And he tells them, he must provide for a good reputation before men, as well as labour for a good Conscience before God. He mentions a third whom he sent with <HI>Titus</HI> and <HI>Bar∣nabas</HI> (whether <HI>Luke,</HI> or <HI>Apollos,</HI> or another is uncertain) whom he often had found faithful, and now very ready to come unto them, upon the special confidence<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">He hath toward you, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> he hath of their goodness and liberality. And as for the persons that are <HI>intrusted</HI> in this business, he shews, they are such as they may have confidence in. As for <HI>Titus,</HI> he was his Companion and fellow labourer in strengthning and con∣firming them in the Faith, and correcting things amiss among them. And for the other Brethren, he tells them, they are the Messengers of the Churches, sent to gather this contribution, and persons in wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the grace of Christ eminently shines, and such by whom the honour of Christ is singularly promoted. Wherefore he desires them to shew unto them, and so consequently to all the Churches whose Messengers they were, a proof of their love; and so they would manifest that his boasting of them hath not been without reason. <HI>From Ver. 1. to the end.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus assured them concerning the integrity of the <HI>Messengers,</HI> he pro∣ceeds <MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="Chap."/> to speak of the Contribution, for the promoting of which, he says he need not write further unto them; for he knew their forwardness therein, and had boasted to the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> that the Christians of <HI>Achaia</HI> (of which <HI>Corinth</HI> was the chief City) had made a preparation to supply the poor Saints of <HI>Judea,</HI> a year ago; and their zeal therein, had provoked many to the like forwardness.

For otherwise when he came with some of <HI>Macedonia</HI> accompanying him, if they should not have their supplies ready, it would tend to his and their disgrace. Therefore he sent these Brethren to them before hand, to exhort them to get their collections ready before he came, that so their beneficence may appear to be their own free bounty, and not a collection difficultly extorted from them<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Ut extor∣tum aliquid▪ <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

And this their liberality would be a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f that they did truly subject themselves to the Gospel of Christ (which injoins Charity and Almsgiving) and would occasion many to glorifie God for it, and for their readiness in communicating unto them, and unto others that are in want, as occasion required.

He con∣concludes this whole matter with thanksgiving unto God for that <HI>great gift</HI> of Charity he had bestowed on them, which inclined their hearts, in so liberal a manner, to relieve the necessities of the Saints (which gift he cannot sufficiently commend) whereby much glory redounds to God, and much honour to the Christian profession. <HI>From Ver. 6. to the end.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third part of the Epistle.</NOTE>He comes now to the <HI>third</HI> part of his Epistle; wherein,</P>
<P N="1"><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="Chap."/> <HI>1.</HI> He vindicates his authority from the contempt cast upon it by <HI>false Teachers, his speech contemptible,</HI> but when absent, <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>severe.</HI> He therefore be∣seeches them by the gentleness and meekness of Christ (whom he was not asham'd to imitate) not to interpret this his behaviour among them otherwise than they ought. He tells them, he desires and wishes that when he comes he may not be forced to use his power with that boldness, which he thought to use against some of them, who accused him of a weak carriage and behaviour in his Apostleship, as either fearing or flattering men, and so walking carnally, and being too mild on one of those grounds. For though he was not free from humane infirmities and weaknesses, yet he did not exercise his Apostleship in a weak manner, or by weak weapons. For the weapons he used were <HI>spiritual, viz. Christian fortitude, zeal, freedom in speaking the truth of God,</HI> and <HI>courage in administring the censures of the Church,</HI> which had a divine force upon the Conscience, to throw down the <HI>strong holds</HI> of carnal wisdom, and the corrupt reasonings and proud conceits, by which corrupt m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n think to defend themselves, either in their <HI>errors</HI> or <HI>vices,</HI> against the Gospel, having in readiness that which serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to re∣venge all disobedience upon the <HI>refractory,</HI> (viz. <HI>excommunication</HI>), which he was resolved to make use of against such persons, when the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> (to wit,
<PB N="207" REF="113"/> the greater part of them) shall have made good their obedience, and reduced them∣selves to good order again *, having been seduced by these false Teachers. He tells them, they ought not to judg of him, or of the power of his Apostleship and Ministry, by his external humble and mild behaviour among them, which seemed to some of them so vile. He shews, that he may (and that justly) be compa∣red with any of those that emulate him. For by all those arguments, by which any of them can prove he is a Disciple of Christs, he may conclude the same of him also. Nay if he should pretend to some more authority from Christ (being an Apostle) than hath been given to others, (and that for the advantage and not the hurt of any), he might make it good. And that his Epistles may not seem only Bug-bears (as his Calumniators affirm'd, saying, that his Letters were indeed <HI>severe</HI> and <HI>authoritative,</HI> but his personal presence weak, and his speech contemptible), he tells them, that such as his Letters and Words are when he is absent, such shall his performances be when he shall be present among them. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 12.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2ly.</HI> In the next place, he refells the vain brags of the false Apostles; who ar∣rogated to themselves the things they never did.

He shews, by extending his <HI>inspection</HI> and <HI>authority</HI> to them, he did not over-extend it, or go beyond his line, as they do, who intrude into, and boast of other m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns labours; for he had advanced as far as to them in the preaching of the Gospel, and had first planted the Faith among them. He tells them, he would not pretend any Title to those whom others have converted, (as was the manner of his Emu∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs), but yet he hoped, that when the <HI>Corinthians</HI> shall be more strength<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned in the Faith, they will deal with their Neighbours to entertain the Gospel, and to be willing to hear him preach it to them, and so the borders of his ministry (through them) shall be more abundantly inlarged, and that according to the rule of his calling, to whom the Apostleship of the Gentiles was committed. And so he shall preach the Gospel beyond <HI>Achaia,</HI> without entring on those parts where the Gospel had been formerly preached by others, or arrogating to himself what they had done. But that he may not seem to glory in himself, or in the gifts of God as <HI>his own,</HI> he shews, that no man ought to attribute or refer any thing he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th to himself, but to acknowledg all his Talents to come from God, and to ascribe the success of all his gifts and endeavours entirely unto Him.

He tells them therefore, that he rather chose to glory in his afflictions and crosses, than in his revelations, as by which he had experience of the power and presence of Christ, co∣vering and sheltring of him, and being his safety and pro∣tection. And he was perfectly pleased with his suffer∣ings for Christs sake; for then the strength of Christ did more manifest it self in him; and the heavier his pres∣sures were, the greater were his supports.

<P>He comes now to excuse his <HI>boasting,</HI> and to shew, that they compell'd him to it, and might have saved him this labour, by defending him themselves, if they had done as they ought. For he had done and suffered as much as any of the eminentest Apostles, (through the grace of God that assisted him, <HI>1 Cor. 15.10.</HI>) though of himself he was nothing, <HI>[1 Cor. 3.7.].</HI> He shews, they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vident arguments, and plain demonstrations, that he was indeed an Apostle of Christ, both by his patient suffering of afflictions, as also by the mighty deeds and miraculous works he had done among them. And they had as great and illustri∣ous gifts of the Spirit bestowed on them by his ministry, as any other Church whatsoever, either founded by him or any other Apostle. Only they differed from from others in this, that all was done for them <HI>gratis</HI><NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg">v. 13. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] Non fui piger vestri damno.

<P>He tells them, he now prepared himself a third time to come to them, having been twice crossed in this his design before, <HI>[see 1 Cor. 16.5. 2 Cor. 1.15, 16.];</HI> and he intended to do it without putting them to charge; for he coveted not their possessions, but their salvation. And as natural Parents usually lay up for, and give to their Children, and do not take from them; so he desired, as their spiritual Father, to inrich them with spiritual good things, and not to take from them any of their temporals. Nay, he was willing to <HI>spend</HI> and to be <HI>spent</HI> for them, though they no way answered his love; and received the false Apostles, his Emula∣tors, and made more of them, than of him their spiritual Father. But (says he) it will be objected by some, that though I was not burthensome to you my self, yet I have cunningly and underhand gotten a great deal from you by my Emissaries. To that he answers, that neither <HI>Titus,</HI> (whom he desi∣red to go to them), nor any other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">v. 18. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] Qui putatur Lucas.</NOTE> he had sent among them, did make any kind of gain of them, but behaved themselves just after the same manner he had done, being guided by the same Spirit, and walking in the same steps. <HI>From Ver. 14. to 19.</HI></P>

For he fears, when he comes among them, he shall not find them such as he would, but guilty of many sins, and that will force him to be severe in his censures. He fears he shall find some among them fallen into enormous crimes, and continuing in them without repentance, and that will occasion great-heart grief to him, much humiliation and dejection of mind, and necessitate him to exercise his Apo∣stolick authority among them in censuring of them, <HI>From Ver. 19. to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He tells them again, how he was now a third time preparing to come to <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="Chap."/> them <HI>[see ch. 12. 14.],</HI> and if the things amiss among them were not amend∣ed, he would punish the committers of them; and such as were convicted of their crimes by the testimony of two or three witnesses [as the Law injoins, <HI>Deut. 19.15</HI>] shall be exclud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from Church-communion. As he told them before, so he tells them now, (as if he were present with them), that in case there be no amendment among them, he will make use of his Apostolick power, (which was very great and extraordinary), by which he inflicted not only spi∣ritual censures, but sometimes also corporal punishments, as appears by the in∣stance of <HI>Bar Jesus,</HI> whom he smote with blindness, <HI>Act. 13.11.</HI> And they did tempt him thereunto, in that they required a proof from him, whether Christs power did concur with his ministry and jurisdiction, and whether Christ would ratifie his censures, by his judgments following them. He shews, that Christ had owned him, and manifested his power in his ministry among them, by converting many of them, and bestowing the gifts of his Spirit upon them, and by many signs and miracles, which he enabled him to do in the midst of them and by his exercise of spiritual discipline among them. And as Christ appeared to be a weak and a frail man by being crucified, but was evidenced to be God omnipotent by his rising from the dead; so he tells them, if they look upon him, as in himself, and in respect of the afflictions he hath been exercised with, he may appear a meer <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>ordinary</HI> man, and to be <HI>weak with Christ,</HI> and therein like and conformable to him; but yet they should find, that he would shew a resem∣blance of Christs life and strength <HI>[2 Cor. 10.3.],</HI> and that the power of Christ liveth in him, and doth manifest it self in him, against impenitent and contuma∣cious sinners. And since they seek a proof of Christs speaking in him, (who first preached the Gospel among them); he bids them look to it, and to examine themselves, whether they be in the Faith, (that is, have a true Faith in them), and whether they be in the state of true Believers, and whether Christ live in them by his Spirit; which they will find to be so, except for the present they are only meer counterfeit unapproved Professors of Christianity. But what∣ever <HI>they</HI> were, he hoped <HI>he</HI> should not be found such an one himself, but a faithful Servant of Christ, and a true Apostle. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 7.</HI></P>
<P>Drawing now towards a Conclusion, he tells them, that he earnestly prays and de∣sires they may do that which is <HI>good</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> and may abstain from all evil. And he prayed thus for them, because he had rather have them good, than having oc∣casion, by punishing their evil manners, to testifie himself an approved and faith∣ful Apostle. For he passeth not for his own credit or reputation, how he be esteemed, so their salvation may be promoted. And if they be innocent, and walk in the truth, they had no reason to fear his authority; for the end of it was to uphold innocency, truth, and righteousness, and only to suppress the con∣trary; and in this sense, the stronger they were, and more vigorous in the acti∣ons
<PB N="212" REF="116"/> of the spiritual life, and the more they disarm'd him by their innocency and harmless walking, of his Apostolick power to censure the obstinate, the more it pleased him. For he desired nothing more, than that all things might be brought into good order among them, and the members of the Church which had been put out by Church c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsures might be restored, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t right a∣gain<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">v. 9. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> est in recta constitutio, reconcinnatio.</NOTE>. Therefore he used the more severity in his Letters, that when he came he might not be forced to ex∣ercise his authority with sharpness; for the end of it was principally <HI>edification,</HI> and not <HI>destruction,</HI> but only by accident, and in case of willful and final impenitency. <HI>From Ver. 7. to 11.</HI></P>
<P>He concludes his Epistle, seriously exhorting them to union<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Be knit toge∣ther.</NOTE> among them∣selves, to be of good comfort in their sufferings for Christ, and to live in peace, praying, that God who is the Au∣thor and Injoiner of love and peace may be with them, and dwell among them with his favourable presence.

The Apostle made him his Companion in his travels throughout the Churches far and near, whom he most diligently and faithfully served in the work of the Lord, some∣times being left with the Churches newly planted, further to instruct them, sometimes being sent as a Messenger to comfort and establish them. Though he had many bodily infirmities upon him, yet he abounded with many eminent graces and gifts, and in process of time being ordain'd a Minister, with imposition of the hands of the Presbytery, he so approved himself in that office, that he became most affectionately dear to <HI>Paul,</HI> insomuch that he makes frequent and honourable mention of him, espe∣cially to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> ch. 2.19, 20. <HI>I have no man like mind∣ed, who will naturally care for your state; for all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christs.

He further declares, that it need not seem incredible that so wonderful mercy and favour was shewed to him, seeing this is most certain and true, that Christ came into the world to manifest his mercy to sinners, yea great sinners, of which number he had reason to reckon himself to be one, because of his persecuting the Church of God <HI>[see 1 Cor. 15.9.].</HI> He further shews, that the Lord had set him f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth for an example and pattern of his long-suffering, mercy, and admirable grace, that sinners to the end of the World, (who shall hear of his wonderful conversion, and the bounty of Christ towards <HI>him</HI>), may be assured of his readi∣ness to receive sinners, and may, upon their repentance and believing in him, expect the like goodness and kindness from him t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wards themselves.

He requires also, that Women, when they come into the Church-assemblies to join in prayer and other duties, should be very modestly attir'd; and that they should study rather to exceed others in good works, than brave Clothes. And that they set themselves quietly to learn and receive instruction in the Church-assemblies, and not presume or take upon them to teach; for that were to usurp authority over the <HI>man,</HI> which he utterly forbids, for two reasons; <HI>1.</HI> Because the man was first formed, and the woman out of him; and that may serve to denote, her subordination to, and dependance on him. <HI>2ly.</HI> The woman was first <HI>deceived</HI> and seduced, and became <HI>Satan</HI>'s instrument to seduce her Husband to transgress Gods Commandment; whence God impos'd upon her, <HI>subjection</HI> to her Husband, and sorrow in <HI>Child-bearing, Gen. 3.16.</HI> But lest <HI>women</HI> should be too much discourag'd at this, he c mfortably levisies what he had said, by assuring them, that notwithstanding this their sorrow and danger in Child bear∣ing, they may be saved as well as men, if they persevere in faith, love, sanctity, sobriety, and modesty. <HI>From Ver. 8. to the end.</HI></P>

<P N="9"><HI>9ly.</HI> He gives <HI>Timothy</HI> several Exhortations, in reference to his ministerial office.

And <HI>2ly.</HI> That he should avoid <HI>Jewish</HI> Fa∣bles, and human Traditions, (which are no more to be valued than old Wives Fables), and exercise himself un∣to real Godliness. For bodily exercise, such as outward <HI>austerities, abstinences</HI> from meats, and such like volun∣tary afflictings of themselves, prescribed by men, are not the things wherein mans true holiness before God consists. For though these things may be of some use in some cases, yet they are but of little value in comparison of true Godliness, seeing they do only tame the body, not sanctifie and change the heart, as a lively faith and love, and the fear of God, do. And then <HI>these</HI> may be abus'd and degenerate into superstition, (as the Apostle testifies, <HI>Col. 2.23.</HI>), but true Godliness is always acceptable unto God, and profitable unto men, having promises of happiness both in this life and that which is to come, annexed to it. This, he shews, was a true saying, and very worthy to be re∣ceived. And for rejecting the inventions of men, and defending and maintaining true Godliness, (which consists in Faith and Obedience); he shews, he laboured and suffered reproach, having confidence in <HI>Gods promise</HI> made to true piety, and in <HI>his salvation,</HI> who as he is (in respect of outward preservations) the Preserver of Men and Beasts, <HI>Psal. 36.6, 7.</HI> so he affords more especial preserva∣tions to Believers in this life, when he sees it conducing to his glory and their good), but assuredly and certainly, he will preserve them from eternal misery in the other world. These things he charges <HI>Timothy</HI> to teach and inculcate. <HI>3ly.</HI> He exhorts him, to give no occasion that his Youth be despised, but to sup∣ply what was wanting to him in age, with gravity of manners; and to be an example to Believers in <HI>speech</HI> and conversation, in charity, in spiritual zeal, and holy affections, in faithfulness and fidelity in his office, and lastly, in all purity. <HI>4ly.</HI> He exhorts him, to be diligent in reading the Scriptures, and in the preach∣ing the Word, while he had an opportunity to stay there; for when the Apostle came thither, he must go along with him, and accompany him in his travels.

And lastly, that he should take heed to himself and his Doctrine<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">Attende tibi, ut recte vivas: attende doctrinae, ut recte alios insti∣tuas.</NOTE>, and continue so doing, which would conduce to his own and his hearers eternal salvation. <HI>From Ver. 6. to the end.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>occasion</HI> of this Epistle seems to be this: The Apostle had heard of some <HI>disagreements,</HI> both in <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>affection,</HI> among the Christians at <HI>Rome,</HI> who were partly <HI>believing Jews,</HI> and partly <HI>believing Gentiles.</HI> The <HI>Jewish</HI> Christians, it seems, mingled <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel</HI> together in the point of Justification; and so zealously upheld the <HI>Jewish</HI> Law, and the <HI>Mosaical</HI> Rites, that they opposed the preaching of the Gospel to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> except they would become <HI>Proselytes,</HI> and submit to <HI>Circumcision:</HI> On the other side, the <HI>Gentile-Christians</HI> understanding themselves exempted from the observation of the <HI>Mosaical</HI> Rites, used their Christian Liberty <HI>with offence.</HI> Now to reconcile these controversies, and to settle them, <HI>both</HI> in the truth, and in unity of judgment and affection, and to remove all emulation be∣tween them, the Apostle writes this Epistle. In which we have,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> THE <HI>Preface</HI> or <HI>Introduction:</HI> wherein, to gain the more credit and be∣lief to his following Instructions, he shews, That he was one who had re∣ceived <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="Chap."/> that singular mercy from Christ, to be called to the high dignity of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> and was authoriz'd, and set apart to the office of preaching the Gospel, which God had promised long before by his <HI>Prophets</HI> in the Old Testament, that it should be revealed, and that to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> as well as to the <HI>Jews.</HI> The subject matter of which Gospel, he shews, concerns <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> his Son, who ac∣cording to the flesh was born of the Seed of <HI>David;</HI> but <HI>according to the Spirit of Holiness,</HI> or that <HI>other Divine Nature</HI> in him, (call'd his <HI>Eternal Spirit, Heb. 9.14. see also 1 Tim. 3.16.</HI> &amp; <HI>1 Pet. 3.18.</HI>), he is most fully and powerfully demonstrated, and declared to be the Son of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; as by many other signs, so especially by his Resurrection from the dead. From this Saviour,
<PB N="224" REF="122"/> he tells them, he had received the favour of this glorious office of the Apostle∣ship<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Apostleship</HI>] <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

Eph. 3.2, 8. <HI>Glas.</HI></NOTE>, to preach the Gospel in his Name, and by his authority, and for his glory; among all Nations, to bring them to the obedience of the Doctrine of Faith, and to confirm them therein. And though he had not planted<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">By <HI>whom</HI> the Church of the <HI>Romans</HI> was planted, or <HI>when,</HI> the Scripture is silent. Papists say by <HI>Peter,</HI> but learned men demonstrate, that <HI>Peter</HI> never was at <HI>Rome;</HI> much less planted the Church there. See <HI>Dav. Paraus</HI> in Rom. 16. dub. 11. <HI>Barnabas</HI> is supposed to have first preached Christ at <HI>Rome,</HI> and to have converted the <HI>Romans</HI> in the reign of <HI>iberius.</HI> See <HI>Clem. Recogn.</HI> l. 1. The reason why this Epistle stands first of all the Apostolical Epistles in our Bibles, is not because it was first written, but because of the dignity of the City to which it was addressed, <HI>viz. Rome,</HI> the Imperial Seat.</NOTE> the Gospel among them at <HI>Rome,</HI> yet he held himself bound to contribute to the advancement of the Faith of those of them, who were effectually called by Christ, and had obedientially subjected themselves to the Gospel. And accordingly he heartily wished the abounding and increase of all grace, and the sweet sense of the favour and love of God to all real Christians at <HI>Rome,</HI> whether <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And in the first place, that he may testifie his great affection to them, he declares, how heartily he gives thanks to God through Jesus Christ, (in whose Name all prayers and thanksgiving ought to be presented, <HI>Eph. 5.20. Col. 3.17.</HI>), that their Faith and sub∣mission to the Gospel, was so famous, and the report of it spread far and near, and made known in all the Churches of the whole World, and spoken of to their great advantage and commendation. Insomuch that he solemnly professes in the presence of God, (whom he heartily and sincerely served in the Gospel of his Son), he did not forget them in his daily prayers; but earnestly requested of the Lord, that what he had so long desired and designed, might happily, (if it seem'd good in his eyes), at last be accomplished, namely, that he might come personally unto them. For he had an extream great desire to see them, not for any other reason, so much as that he might impart unto them some of those spi∣ritual gifts which God had endued him with, and might communicate to them a further knowledg of the mysteries of the Gospel, that they might be more established and confirmed in the Faith, against all temptations whatsoever. Yea he desired to see them, that they might be mutually comforted, by a mutual communication of the Faith, that both <HI>he</HI> and <HI>they</HI> had in Christ Jesus. For it could not but greatly comfort and strengthen <HI>them,</HI> to hear him discourse of his Faith in Christ, and it would also revive <HI>him</HI> to hear them declare their Faith in the same Je∣sus also; and so they might be mutual comforts each to other. He desires they should know that he had often purposed to come unto them, but still by one obsta∣cle or other was hindred; and he desired to come to them, that he might be a means of converting some there to the Faith, and of confirming others already converted, as among other <HI>Gentiles</HI> he had been a means of converting several, and gaining them to Christ. For by the nature of his office, and by the special com∣mand of Christ, he was a <HI>debter</HI> to all sorts of men, being obliged to preach the Gos∣pel to them, whether they were <HI>Greeks,</HI> those of the most <HI>polite</HI> Nations; or <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and those of the <HI>ruder.</HI> And as far as concerned himself, he was most ready to take a journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> to preach the Gospel there also. For he was far from being asham'd of the Gospel of Christ, which is a powerful means (in the hand of God) of bringing all those to Salvation, that effectually embrace it, whether they be <HI>Jews</HI> (who had the priviledg to have it first preached to them) or <HI>Gentiles. From Ver. 1. to 17.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He comes now to the <HI>Body of the Epistle:</HI> And having mention∣ed the <HI>Gospel,</HI> he shews, that by it the <HI>Righteousness of God,</HI> that is, the Righteousness whereby we stand just and righteous in the sight of God, (which God imputes to sinners, and accepts for their righteousness, and pardons them for it, <HI>see ch. 3.22.</HI>), is revealed and taught, and clearly made known to be <HI>of Faith,</HI> [or <HI>by Faith], unto Faith;</HI> that is, 'tis revealed to be by <HI>such a</HI>

And this is the <HI>main proposition,</HI> which he explains and confirms by many arguments, from ver, <HI>17.</HI> of ch. <HI>1.</HI> to ch. <HI>12.</HI> namely, that <HI>we are justified by Faith in Christ, and not by Works, or our internal Righteousness.</HI> This he proves, <HI>1.</HI> By a citation out of the Prophet <HI>Habuccuc, ch. 2. v. 4.</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">A famous Text, <HI>thrice</HI> alledg∣ed in the New Testament, Heb. 10.38. <HI>To perswade to patience.</HI> Gal. 3.2. to prove <HI>no justification by the Law.</HI> And Rom. 1.17. to prove <HI>justifica∣tion by Faith</HI> The Hebrew is, <HI>The just shall live by his Faith.</HI> The Apo¦stle still omits the particle His.

The heart of the <HI>wicked</HI> would be high, and proud, and lift up in a foolish conceit of their own wisdom, and power to secure themselves. But the <HI>righteous,</HI> (such as were in a state of reconciliation with God), should <HI>live,</HI> and find comfort in that trouble, by their <HI>Faith</HI> in God. So the Apostle shews, that he that is <HI>evangelically righteous,</HI> or <HI>just,</HI> shall <HI>live,</HI> not only a life of grace here, but attain to a life of glory hereafter; by <HI>Faith in Christ,</HI> and resting on his righteousness and merits. <HI>2ly.</HI> He shews, that men have need of this imputed righteousness of Christ; because of themselves, they are all <HI>unrighteous;</HI> and God hath revealed his wrath from Heaven against such. This he proves by instancing first in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> secondly in the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> For the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he shews, they were guilty of detaining the truth of God, (that is, the true notions they had of God, and their duty to <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>their Neighbour</HI> by the light of Nature), in unrighteousness; so that they would not walk according to that light, but suppressed it, and resisted it. For <HI>that</HI> which may be naturally known of God, (<HI>viz.</HI> his infinite power, wisdom, and goodness), is manifest <HI>in them,</HI> that is, in their minds and consciences, (though they followed not the light shining in them): or is manifest <HI>among them, viz.</HI> by the writings and discourses of their learned men. For God hath made it known unto them, partly by imprinting those Notions of Himself, and of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil</HI> in their hearts; and partly by the Book of the Creatures, in which his glorious <HI>Attributes</HI> are written in great Characters. For his invisible and in∣comprehensible Nature, and Almighty Power, are (even ever since the Creation of the World) clearly to be understood by his works which are seen, <HI>viz.</HI> his works of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> so far as to render those, which do not discern them, nor take notice of them, <HI>inexcusable.</HI> And seeing they glorified not God according to that knowledg, which the light of Nature gave them of him, nor were thankfull for his benefits; they became vain in their imaginations and reasonings concerning God, and his worship, and feigned many fabulous and vain Gods unto themselves, whereby their foolish heart was more and more dark∣ned concerning the <HI>true God;</HI> and those among them that seemed to be most wise and learned, were in those matters as blind and foolish as others. Insomuch, that they horribly dishonoured the All-glorious God, by framing the vile Images of men and beasts to represent him, <HI>[Isa. 40.18. Psal. 106.20.];</HI> whereas they should have conceived God to be so infinitely glorious, that nothing could set forth his glory sufficiently. Ʋpon which provocation of theirs, God gave them up <HI>judi∣cially</HI> to the lusts of their own hearts; so that being left to themselves, (and not restrained from the pursuit of their filthy desires), they brake out into pol∣lutions
<PB N="226" REF="123"/> and uncleannesses, of the most odious kinds; which God permitted them to fall into, as a punisment upon them for their horrible Idolatry, they having changed the truth of God, that is, the true Notions they had of God, into an Idol<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.4.

Yea upon this provocation it was, that God so far left them to them∣selves, that they fell into the most unnatural lusts, such as are not found even among brute Beasts. And so they receiv'd a just recompence and reward for their Idolatry, (which is call'd spiritual whoredom), in being left by God to the vilest of all corporal uncleanness. And 'tis no wonder, that <HI>they</HI> should not keep the <HI>Order</HI> of Nature, who forsook the <HI>Author</HI> of Nature, as <HI>Anselm</HI> speaks. Fur∣thermore, He shews, that they regarding not to know God, so far as by the light of Nature and the works of Creation they might have done, nor to acknow∣ledg and reverence him accordigly, God as a just Judg, gave them to a reprobate or injudicious mind, whereby they approv'd of nothing that was right and good, but fell into most gross abominations and enormities; and that against the <HI>second Table</HI> as well as against the <HI>first.</HI> Of which sins, reigning among the Heathen <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> he gives a large Catalogue<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">Among which he reckons <HI>ha∣ters of God,</HI> that is, <HI>quar∣rellers at his providence,</HI> when any adverse thing happens unto them.</NOTE>.

<P><MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Chap."/> Having thus shewed the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> generally, to be most grievous sinners, and so condemned, and not justified by their own works; He now comes to answer an objection which some of them might make against what he had said. They might possibly say, What shall our <HI>Lawgivers</HI> and <HI>Magistrates</HI> (who condemn vice, and commend virtue) be so deeply censured? For answer to this, the Apostle (by an elegant <HI>Apostrophe,</HI> wherein he speaketh as it were <HI>face to face</HI> to this <HI>Gentile</HI> who thus objecteth) acknowledges, that 'twas true, they had some among them that declared against wickedness and punished it. But those were the most inexcusable of all others, because they themselves did the like, or as ill things (though more secretly) as those which they condemned in others. And they might assure themselves that the wrath and judgment of God (which is just and according to the merit of the deed) is against them that do such things, whether <HI>secretly</HI> or <HI>openly.</HI> For tell me (says he) thou <HI>Magistrate,</HI> who judgest ano∣ther for crimes that thou thy self committest; canst thou in reason think to escape the righteous judgment of God? Or canst thou think, because God hath hitherto spared thee, that thou shalt finally escape? Dost not thou consider that Gods long suffering and forbearance invites thee to repentance, and not to go on in thy sins. Dost not thou consider, that by thy impenitence and persisting in thy sins, thou treasurest up to thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his works, either the rewards of his grace, or the punishments of his justice; namely, <HI>eternal life</HI> to them that persevere in obedience to the truth, hoping for, and expecting such a reward; but to the Adversaries of the truth, and servants of unrighteousness, besides the manifestations of his wrath in this life, <HI>eternal death</HI> and <HI>misery</HI> at the end of it. And God will have no respect to any Nation (however priviledged) in this matter, but in every Nation they that fear him,
<PB N="227" REF="123"/> and work righteousness shall be rewarded with <HI>glory, honour,</HI> and <HI>eternal peace;</HI> and they that go on in their sins and impenitency, shall be punished with <HI>eternal death</HI> and <HI>misery;</HI> and that, whether they be <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI> For God measures not men by their outward conditions and circumstances, so as upon that account, to accept or reject any man. And therefore the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had not the Law written in Tables, but had it written upon their Hearts, shall be judged by that innate Law which they have violated, and not by the other. And the <HI>Jews,</HI> who sin against the Law given them by <HI>Moses,</HI> shall be judged according to the threatnings of that Law. Nor is it possible that the <HI>Jews,</HI> because they <HI>know the Law,</HI> and hear it often read in their Synagogues, should be accounted righteous before God, except they perform perfect obedience to it, which because they cannot do, it follows that they cannot be exempted from de∣served condemnation; and so they have need to seek for righteousness by Christ, as well as others. And as for the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who have not the <HI>written Law</HI> as delivered by <HI>Moses,</HI> yet have it imprinted in their hearts, and do by the light of Nature, some things which God hath commanded in his Law; to <HI>these,</HI> that Law <HI>within them,</HI> is a Law, as their own Consciences do witness, their thoughts, or reflections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 15. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] Legis opus est declarare, quae rectè, quaeve ini∣què facta sunt.</NOTE> by turns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">v. 15. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, h. e.

<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Having thus handled the case of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he comes in the next place to speak of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who would possibly alledg for themselves, that some∣thing surely must be allowed to their priviledges, and that they are not to be brought into the same condemnation with the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> That he might there∣fore speak more particularly to this case, he brings in (as it were) some prin∣cipal <HI>Teacher of the Law,</HI> and <HI>Patron</HI> of righteousness <HI>by Works,</HI> producing <HI>seven</HI> props of his vain confidence; all which the Apostle (by way of concession) allows; and yet proves, that the <HI>Jews</HI> are not to expect to be justified by these before God, any more than the <HI>Gentiles</HI> may, by that obedience which they perform to the Law of Nature. And in the first place, says he, thou sayest, Thou art a <HI>Jew,</HI> which was a <HI>name,</HI> not of a Nation only, but of a Professor of the true Religion, and of a Worshipper of the true God. <HI>2.</HI> Thou dependest on thy outward performances of Law, on thy Circumcision, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as if justification were to be had thereby, and could not be had without it. <HI>3.</HI> Thou makest thy boast of God, <HI>viz.</HI> that thou art of that People that were chosen above all other Na∣tions, and are in covenant with God. <HI>4.</HI> Thou knowest his will, not from the meer collection of reason, but from the books of <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets. 5.</HI> Thou triest things that differ, (being instructed therein out of the Law)<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">v 15. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, that is, canst distinguish betwixt lawful and unlawful, between what is commanded and what is forbidden. <HI>6.</HI> Thou hast such abundant knowledg that thou canst teach others. <HI>7.</HI> Thou hast a model, or scheme, or system in thy head of that know∣ledg, which is here and there scattered up and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn, and contained in the Law. The Apostle answers, that all these things being granted, yet they are insuffici∣ent
<PB N="228" REF="124"/> to make any man righteous before God, or to free him from condemnation; for it could not but be granted, that many, if not most of their Rabbies and Teachers did not practise the duties they taught others, but lived in those or the like sins and vices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cum haec scriberet Paulus, re∣cens erat memoria Asinaei, &amp; Asilaei, in Babyloniâ Judaeorum, ad quos in∣gens multitudo confluxerat; qui om∣nes non nisi ex rapto vivebant, <HI>Joseph.

<P>But the <HI>Jews</HI> might here possibly urge and plead their <HI>Circumcision</HI> as a Seal of the Covenant between God and them, and thence inferr, that they were not in such danger of condemnation as the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The Apostle answers, that for men that so liv'd as they did, 'twas madness to think that Circumcision will stand them in such stead, as to exempt them from condemnation. For <HI>Circum∣cision</HI> will not profit nor avail to justification, except it be joined with perfect obedience to the whole Law; but if transgression of the Law be found in him that is circumcised, he is in the same condition with an <HI>uncircumcis'd</HI> Heathen. Yea, if the uncircumcised could do that which the Law requires to justification, that is, perform perfect obedience to the moral Law, they should be accepted of God, as well as if they had been circumcised So that if a <HI>Gentile,</HI> who is by Na∣ture without Circumcision could fulfil the moral Law perfectly, he would condemn a <HI>Jew,</HI> who is only outwardly (and according to the Let∣ter of the Law<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">Legem facere, non est verba legis exteriùs sequi, sed mentem, &amp; intentionem legis obedienter imple∣re. <HI>Cassiodorus.</HI></NOTE>) <HI>circumcised,</HI> but hath not that purity of heart and life, which that <HI>Ceremony</HI> was ap∣pointed to signifie and engage all that are circumcised unto. For he tells them, that he is not a Child of <HI>Abraham,</HI> (such to whom the promise of life appertains), who is only born of <HI>Abrahams</HI> race, and no more: neither is <HI>that</HI> the available <HI>Cir∣cumcision,</HI> which is only outward: <HI>viz.</HI> the mark imprinted in the flesh: But he is a <HI>Jew indeed,</HI> a true Son of <HI>Abraham,</HI> (who shall be accepted with God, although he be not so by birth), who is <HI>so</HI> inwardly, and by a true con∣version of his heart to God. For the <HI>renovation</HI> of the mind and heart by the Holy Ghost, is the <HI>true Circumcision,</HI> and not <HI>that</HI> which is outwardly visible in the body, perform'd according to the Letter of the Law; and such renewed persons shall have praise and commendation, if not among men, (who see the outside only, and among whom 'tis a great dignity to be a circumcised <HI>Jew</HI>); yet with God, who looks into the heart. <HI>From Ver. 25. to the end.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Chap."/> He comes now to answer some other Objections, which the <HI>Jews</HI> would be apt to make against what he had said. <HI>1.</HI> If the case be so, then it will be said, that the <HI>Jew</HI> hath no advantage or priviledg above the <HI>Gentile,</HI> neither is there any profit of <HI>Circumcision.</HI> He answers, that the <HI>Jews</HI> have a great advantage above any other Nation, and that, <HI>1.</HI> Because unto them were committed <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> oracles of God,</HI> that is, all the <HI>revelations of his will,</HI> the <HI>Law,</HI> the <HI>Sa∣cram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts</HI> and <HI>Seals of the Covenant,</HI> the <HI>Prophecies</HI> and <HI>Promises of the Messiah,</HI> by which they might more easily come to know the true God, and the way of Salvation <HI>by the expected M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssias,</HI> than any others. And if any shall say, that this advantage was lost, by the unbelief of a great part of them, He answers, that the <HI>faithfulness</HI> of God in his Promises and Covenant, is not made void by the unbelief of men. For it ought ever to be acknowledged and confessed, that God cannot be otherwise than true and faithful in performing what
<PB N="229" REF="124"/> he hath promised, though all mankind should be false and deceitful, and should fail to perform their duty: And for the proof of this, he cites a passage out of <HI>Psal. 51.4.</HI> (according to the version of the Septuagint) where <HI>David</HI> hum∣bly confesseth his hainous sin against God, that by his penitent confession God might be <HI>justified,</HI> and acquitted from all injustice in reproving him by <HI>Nathan</HI> and denouncing those heavy Judgments that he intended to bring upon him, and that he might be clear and unreproveable for so judging him for his sin, and might clearly overcome and win the victory when he should be judged or questioned, or impleaded by any man, for his dealing so severely with <HI>David.</HI> So that the Apostle applies these words from the <HI>hypothesis</HI> (in <HI>Davids</HI> singular case) to the <HI>thesis, viz.</HI> to Gods general faithfulness, truth, and righteousness in all his Promises, Covenants, and Proceedings. And thus the <HI>unrighteousness of men</HI> is so far from making void, that it more commends, and <HI>sets off,</HI> and il∣lustrates the <HI>righteousness of God.</HI> But <HI>2ly.</HI> It will be said, If this be so, then God seems to be unrighteous in punishing those sins, which do so illustrate, and <HI>set off</HI> his righteousness. This Objection the Apostle makes in the person of a carnal man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, ignorant of God, and replies, that the Objection is blasphemous; for 'tis impossible, that he that shall judg the world should be unjust. But <HI>3ly,</HI> This man will further object, that, If the truth and faithfulness of God be made more abundantly manifest, by the falseness, lying, and unfaithfulness of man; then he is so far from deserving condemnation for it, that he may securely go on in it, (according to the Apostles Doctrine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Videntur hi vecordes hujus ca∣lumniae occasionem sumpsisse ex eo quod saepè doceret Apostolus, Superabundâsse gratiam Dei, ubi super∣abundavit hominum iniquitas, &amp; eam cessisse in laudem gratiae, &amp; justitiae Dei. <HI>A Lap.</HI></NOTE>), that the glory of God may be more advanced thereby. The Apostle answers, that they were malicious slanderers that charged him or the other Apostles that they held such a wretched <HI>position</HI> as this, <HI>viz. that they might do evil, that good might come of it,</HI> which he was so far from owning or approving, that he declares their condemnation to be just who bold and practise such Doctrines, and vent such Calumnies. <HI>5ly,</HI> But the <HI>Jews</HI> will further say, What are not they better, and more righteous, and in a better estate, as to justification by their works, than the <HI>Gentiles?</HI> He answers, Not at all; for he had hitherto proved, (<HI>viz.</HI> in his two first Chap∣ters), that both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are naturally under sin, and therefore the <HI>Gospel-righteousness</HI> is no less necessary for the one, than for the other. This he further proves, by many clear testimonies out of the Old Testament, as out of <HI>Psal. 14.1, 2, 3. &amp; Psal. 53 1, 2, 3.</HI> where the Prophet speaking of the <HI>unre∣generate</HI> in his time, and of all others in their natural estate, <HI>out of Christ,</HI> pronounceth, <HI>1.</HI> That <HI>no man is righteous. 2.</HI> That all are naturally <HI>blind</HI> and <HI>ignorant</HI> of the things that concern their Salvation. <HI>3.</HI> That <HI>none</HI> seek∣eth after God, to know and worship him as they ought. <HI>4.</HI> That they are <HI>all</HI> gone aside from God, and from the way wherein God appointed them to walk; and being so corrupt by Nature they are unfit to bring forth any good fruits, or to do any good. He goes on further to demonstrate this, from <HI>Psal. 5.9.</HI> where from what was spoken of <HI>Davids</HI> enemies in <HI>particular,</HI> he proves the corruption of all mankind in <HI>general;</HI> and that because (naturally) there is the same fountain of corruption in all. <HI>Their throat,</HI> says he, is like a Se∣pulcher newly opened, out of which comes nothing but stench and filthiness, <HI>viz.</HI> murderous pestilential threatnings; they have a false and deceitful <HI>tongue;</HI> their slanders are no less hurtful than the poison of Asps, <HI>Psal. 140.3.</HI> their <HI>mouth</HI> is full of cursing and bitter speeches, <HI>Psal. 10.7.</HI> they are ready to commit all manner of <HI>cruelty,</HI> and violence, and know not how to live quietly themselves, nor to suffer others to be quiet, <HI>Psal. 59.7, 8.</HI> There is no <HI>fear</HI> of God be∣fore their eyes; and so there is nothing to restrain them from running into all sorts of wickedness, <HI>Psal. 36.21.</HI> And, lest the <HI>Jews</HI> should think to elude and evade the force of these Testimonies, as not belonging to them, he tells them, that what the <HI>Law,</HI> that is, the <HI>books of the Old Testament,</HI> the <HI>Psalms</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> thus say, they say <HI>to</HI> and <HI>of</HI> the <HI>Jews;</HI> and by complaining so
<PB N="230" REF="125"/> much of their universal defection and wickedness, they include <HI>them,</HI> and otn only the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to be obnoxious to the wrath of God, and justly punishable by him, without being able to say any thing for themselvs. From all these fore∣cited Testimonies, he concludes, that <HI>by the works of the Law no flesh shall be justified in the sight of God,</HI> because man, <HI>since the fall,</HI> is disabled by his innate corruption and sin, to fulfil the Law, either <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>written;</HI> so that all the efficacy it hath, is only to discover to him his sin, and (without Gods mercy in Christ) to seal up to him his condemnation, <HI>[Gal. 2.16.]. From Ver. 1. to 21.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus shewed <HI>negatively,</HI> that by the works of the Law, <HI>righteous∣ness</HI> and <HI>justification</HI> is not to be had, he comes now to prove the <HI>affirmative part</HI> of his position, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>God hath manifested another way of justi∣fication in his word,</HI> viz. <HI>by Faith in Jesus Christ</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>v. 22.</HI> By Faith of Jesus Christ,] Faith <HI>is to be taken here</HI> passively <HI>to signifie the</HI> Faith whereby Christ is be∣lieved on.</NOTE>. For he tells them, that now, since the coming of Christ, the <HI>righteousness of God</HI> (that is, which avails be∣fore God, and which he freely allows to man for his justi∣fication) is manifested to be the <HI>righteousness of Christ,</HI> imputed to all such, as by a lively Faith receive it, and not to be <HI>that</HI> which men pretend to, by the performance of the works of the Law, either <HI>natu∣ral</HI> or <HI>written.</HI> And he tells them, that both the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> bear witness unto this righteousness. As for example, In the <HI>Law,</HI> (or one of the books of <HI>Moses,</HI> viz. <HI>Genesis, ch. 22.18.</HI>), God promised <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> that <HI>in his seed (viz.</HI> in the <HI>Messias</HI> that was to come of him) <HI>all nations of the earth shall be blessed.</HI> And this Doctrine was taught by the Prophets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Act. 26.22.</NOTE> also, as we may see, <HI>Isa. 53.

And he intended the rather at this <HI>present season, (viz.</HI> be∣fore he brought destruction on the <HI>Jews</HI> for their incorri∣bleness), to make his righteousness and goodness appear to all the world, in that he had sent the <HI>promised Messias,</HI> for <HI>whose sake</HI> he was freely ready to pardon sin, and to justifie those that believe in him. And seeing these things are so, he asks what man had any cause of boasting in himself? Indeed if he were justified by his own works, or inherent righteousness, he might boast that the meritorious cause of his justification was in himself; but seeing that cannot be, all boasting is excluded, and that not by the <HI>Doctrine of Works,</HI> but by

Therefore he concludes, that a man is <HI>justified by Faith,</HI> and not by the <HI>works of the Law,</HI> done either before conversion or after. He shuts up this discourse, by shewing, <HI>1.</HI> That <HI>this way of justification</HI> is common both to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> For as God is <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same,</HI> so is his way of justifying sinners <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> to all Nations, both to circumcised <HI>Jews</HI> and uncircumcised <HI>Gentiles,</HI> namely, by Faith in his Son. <HI>2.</HI> He shews, that the Doctrine of justification <HI>by Faith,</HI> and not <HI>by the works of the Law,</HI> doth not make void the <HI>Law,</HI> but rather establishes it. For the Gospel shews, how firm and irrevocable the Law is, seeing Christ was made under the Law, and was, by his fulfilling the Law, to purchase for man a right to the life it promis'd; and <HI>by be∣lieving in Christ</HI> (who obeyed the Law, and satisfied the breach of it), we acknowledg, that without exact obedience to the Law there can be no salvation; which exact obedience we being not able to perform, our Saviour hath perform'd it for us. And lastly, he tells them, this <HI>Doctrine of Faith</HI> establisheth the Law still <HI>as a rule,</HI> though not as a <HI>Covenant. From Ver. 21. to the end.</HI></P>

<P>He now moves a Question, Whether this blessedness of <HI>justification by Faith alone,</HI> belongs to the <HI>Circumcision,</HI> that is, the <HI>Jews</HI> only, or to the <HI>Uncir∣cumcision,</HI> that is, the <HI>Gentiles</HI> also? And seeing he had before asserted, that <HI>Abrahams Faith</HI> was reckoned to him for <HI>righteousness,</HI> he now inquires, <HI>when</HI> it was reckoned to him, and in what state <HI>Abraham</HI> was when he was pro∣nounced righteous? He answers, it was fourteen years, at least, before he was circumcised <HI>[Gen. 15.2.],</HI> therefore this way of being Righteous does not be∣long only to the <HI>Circumcision,</HI> or the <HI>Jews,</HI> but to the <HI>uncircumcised Gen∣tiles</HI> also, who believing in Christ become sharers with <HI>Abraham</HI> in that blessed∣ness. But then it may be objected, If <HI>Abraham</HI> was justified whilst he was un∣circumcised, to what purpose was he circumcised? He answers, that <HI>Abraham</HI> received Circumcision as a <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Seal</HI> of the Covenant of Grace, made to him and his Seed <HI>[Gen. 17.2.4.10.],</HI> and as an obsignation that the <HI>righ∣teousness of Faith</HI><NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg">Sigillum <HI>justitiae</HI>] quo scil. te∣stificabatur Deus, Abrahae justitiam certam esse, &amp; legitimam, justitiam; adeptam, inquam, ante per fidem cum adhuc esset praeputiatus. <HI>A Lapide.</HI></NOTE>, was the true way for a sinner to become righteous; which righteousness <HI>Abraham</HI> had obtained whilst he was uncircumcised, to the end, that he might be the <HI>Father</HI> (in a spiritual sense) of <HI>Belie∣vers</HI> among the <HI>Gentiles</HI> (that were uncircumcised), and the <HI>Father</HI> of those that believe among the <HI>Jews</HI> (who were circumcised), namely, to as many of them, as (besides their Cir∣cumcision) imitated his Faith. Therefore the righteousness of Faith is common to Believers, both <HI>circumcis'd</HI> and <HI>uncircumcis'd,</HI> and reckoned, or imputed to all that follow the example of the Faith of <HI>Abraham,</HI> which he had when he was uncircumcised; and therein they are all <HI>his Seed,</HI> if not by generation, yet by imitation. And marvel not, saith he, that I interpose the condition, <HI>if they walk in the steps of Abrahams Faith;</HI> for the great Promise made to <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> and his Seed that they should possess that rich, and fertile, and pleasant part of the world<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg">Mundus, pro parte mundi pri∣mariâ. &amp; à Deo singulariter in pecu∣lium populi sui selectâ, terrâ nimi∣rum Canaan, accipitur. <HI>Glass.</HI></NOTE>, to wit, <HI>Canaan,</HI> with the Coun∣tries adjacent, (under which Heaven it self was also ty∣pically promised and comprehended, <HI>Heb. 11.14, 16.</HI>), was not made upon Condition of their performing perfect obedience to the Law, either of <HI>nature,</HI> or <HI>that after∣wards given at Sinai;</HI> but they were to obtain it, by the righteousness of Faith, and their trusting and depending on the gracious Promise of God. Now (says he) if they <HI>that are of the Law,</HI> that is, that seek to be justified by the works of the Law, be heirs of this promised inheritance, then <HI>the way of Faith</HI> prescribed by God, is to no purpose. And if it could be sup∣posed, that God had promised to conveigh the inheritance to them who performed
<PB N="233" REF="126"/> perfect obedience to the Law, that Promise would not avail them, seeing no man is able to perform perfect legal righteousness. And 'tis evident, that the Law is so far from justifying, and so giving a <HI>title</HI> to the Inheritance, that it <HI>work∣eth wrath,</HI> that is, it reveals and pronounces condemnation, and death, upon the guilty for their transgressions: not that of it self, it was originally destin'd to subject men to punishment, but by <HI>accident</HI> and <HI>occasionally</HI> in respect of mans disobedience, it doth inevitably adjudg him thereunto. Whereas were there no Law written in <HI>nature,</HI> or <HI>given by God,</HI> there would be no transgression, and so no Condemnation. The Law therefore is so far from justifying, that it condemns. Seeing then, that neither Justification, nor the promised Inheritance, (which typified Heaven), is obtained by the <HI>works of the Law,</HI> it follows, that it must needs be obtain'd by <HI>Faith.</HI> And God hath appointed it to be ob∣tainable by Faith, that it might be of free and undeserved <HI>grace</HI> and favour; and to be of grace, that His promise might stand firm and sure to all the be∣lieving Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> (whereas it would be unsure and uncertain, if it depended on the condition of performing perfect obedience to the Law), and not to them <HI>only,</HI> who are his Seed according to the flesh, (to whom the Law was given), but to them also which imitate his Faith, (though they be <HI>Gentiles</HI>); for he is the Father of all that believe, whether <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles. From Ver. 9. to 16.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, He goes on highly to commend the Faith of <HI>Abraham,</HI> setting it out as a pattern to be imitated and followed. He shews, that it was promised to <HI>Abraham</HI> by reason of his Faith, that he should be <HI>the Father of many Na∣tions,</HI> that is, of <HI>all Believers</HI> in the several Nations of the World, answer∣able<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] Ad instar Dei. So far hath God honoured <HI>Abrahams</HI> Faith, that in respect thereof, He hath made him like himself, a <HI>Father,</HI> not of this or th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Nation only, but universally of <HI>all Believers,</HI> among all Nations, believing after his Example.</NOTE>, or like unto God himself, (in whom he be∣lieved), who is the Father of the <HI>Gentile</HI> as well as of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Believers. This God, <HI>Abrahams</HI> Faith rested upon, who by his omnipotent power is able to <HI>quicken the dead,</HI> and raise them to life again, and will certain∣ly do it, (and so likewise is able to quicken the <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> who are dead in sins and trespasses, as well as he quickened <HI>Sarahs</HI> dead womb), and <HI>calleth those things which be not, as though they were,</HI> that is, causeth those things by his word and power, to appear and subsist, which had <HI>no being</HI> before, as he did in the creation of all things; and therefore 'tis not so much to be wondred at, if he makes the <HI>Gentiles</HI> (by conversion) what they were not before, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>children of Abraham.</HI> He further declares, that this Patriarch <HI>Abraham</HI> believed, and had a strong hope and trust in the promise and power of God against all natural grounds of hope, namely, that <HI>he should have a Son,</HI> and so be a <HI>stock</HI> from whence many Nations should spring, according to what was said, <HI>Gen. 15.5. So shall thy seed be,</HI> viz. <HI>as the stars of heaven for multitude.</HI> He further adds, that <HI>Abraham</HI> regarded not the great difficulties objected to his Faith, from his own and his wifes age. He admitted no doubts, or questions touching the promise of God (through unbelief<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="marg">Dominus <HI>Saram</HI> reprehendit ridentem [Gen. 18.12] non <HI>Abra∣hamum</HI> [Gen. 17.17.]: Quia illius ri∣sus <HI>admirationis</HI> &amp; <HI>laetitiae</HI> fuit, Sarae autem <HI>dubitationis. August. de Civ. Dei. lib.</HI> 16. <HI>c.</HI> 31.</NOTE>), but without all dispute, or arguing to the contrary, de∣pended fully on God for the performance of it, and so gave to God the glory of his faithfulness, and power, assuring himself, that he who is omnipotent, could and would per∣form what he had promised. Which stedfast Faith of his was imputed to him for righteousness, because he looked by Faith to the <HI>Messias</HI> promised, who was to come of his Seed. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w this, that <HI>his Faith was imputed to him for righteousness,</HI> was not written, (says the Apostle) for <HI>Abrahams</HI> sake alone, but for <HI>ours</HI> also, that is, for our pro∣fit and comfort; to shew us, that <HI>Faith</HI> shall be imputed to all others also for <HI>Righteousness,</HI> who shall firmly trust in God through the merit and mediation of Christ Jesus for that blessing. This Jesus, he tells them, God sent into the
<PB N="234" REF="127"/> world to be our Redeemer, and he was delivered to death for the expiation of our sins and offences, and God hath raised him again to life, to assure us, that our <HI>Surety</HI> hath paid our debts, and that we shall certainly be justified, if we truly believe in him. <HI>From Ver. 16, to the end.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="Chap."/> He proceeds to another argument, to confirm the Doctrine of <HI>justification by Faith in Christ alone,</HI> and that is, from the blessed fruits it produces, namely, <HI>peace,</HI> and <HI>reconciliation</HI> with God, and an introduction of us into his favour again, and a confirmation<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Stare in gratiâ,</HI> est de gratiâ certum &amp; securum esse; hoc alterum est beneficium mortis Christi ex justi∣ficatione fluens, certitudo immota gratiae praesentis, &amp; futurae. <HI>Par.</HI> in loc.</NOTE> of us in it; also <HI>rejoicing in tribulation,</HI> as the means God will sanctifie to accustom us more to patience, and so to increase that grace in us, and in the exercise whereof he will give us more experi∣ence of his faithfulness, and care of us, and so strengthen a well-grounded hope in us, (which will not deceive us), that he will never forsake us. And that which further strengthens this hope, is, that his Holy Spirit (which cannot lye) doth usually in time of tribulation more abundantly testifie his love to the hearts of true Be∣lievers. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 6.</HI></P>
<P>Ʋnder <HI>this head</HI> he also proves, that they <HI>that are justified by Faith</HI> shall certainly be saved from the wrath to come; and this he demonstrates, <HI>1.</HI> From the greatness of Christs love to <HI>such,</HI> before their justification, when they lay wel∣tring in sin and misery, unable to help themselves. He shews, that for such un∣godly persons as these, Christ in the fulness of time came to dye. And what a degree of love this was, he tells them, they may judg by considering how things usually are carried among men. Among whom, though for a very <HI>merciful</HI> and <HI>benign</HI> person, some one man would perhaps venture his life, yet for <HI>any man else,</HI> (though he were a righteous and just man), they would scarcely find any body that would be willing to do it. But God expresses a mercy and kindness infinitely above this; for He, when he had nothing in the Object to move him to it, when we were profane ungodly sinners, yet even then He was plea∣sed to send his Son to dye for us. And if the love of Christ was so strong and efficacious towards us, as to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve him to dye for us before we believed; surely his <HI>love</HI> will be much more towards us <HI>now,</HI> and his <HI>complacency</HI> greater in us, when we are actually justified by Faith in his blood; so that there is no cause to fear but that we shall be saved from wrath through him. <HI>2.</HI> He shews, that if, when we were enemies, Christ dyed to work our reconciliation and peace with God (through Faith in his blood); certainly, being now actually justified and reconciled to God, by our believing in him, we need not doubt but we shall be saved by him, seeing he now liveth and sitteth at the right hand of God, and there intercedes for us, and hath all things subjected unto him. <HI>3.</HI> See∣ing Christ by his death, sufferings, and intercession hath procured God to be <HI>our God</HI> and <HI>Father</HI> (which is more than meerly to save us from wrath), we need not doubt, but that he will do <HI>that</HI> also for us. <HI>From 6, to 12.</HI></P>
<P>He further pursues this Argument, by shewing, that the <HI>righteousness</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> is not less effectual to save those that by Faith are united to him, than <HI>Adams</HI> sin was to destroy those who naturally descend from him. This he proves by comparing Christ and <HI>Adam</HI> together, and shewing their <HI>similitude</HI> and <HI>dissi∣militude; 1.</HI> As by <HI>Adam sin</HI> entred into the world, and <HI>death</HI> by sin, upon all that are his Children by nature; so by Christ <HI>righteousness</HI> came into the world, and by righteousness <HI>life,</HI> unto all that are spiritually born of him. For, before the giving of the Law by <HI>Moses,</HI> sin was in the world, and was imputed, as may appear by this, that Death (which is the wages of sin) reigned over In∣fants, that had not sinned actually as <HI>Adam</HI> had done. Therefore, besides the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> which Infants could not transgress, there was <HI>another Law</HI> which God had given to the <HI>first man,</HI> the transgression whereof was imputed to
<PB N="235" REF="127"/> all his posterity, yea even unto Infants. And this <HI>first man</HI> (he shews) was a <HI>type</HI> or <HI>figure</HI> of him that was to come, <HI>viz.</HI> of Christ Jesus. For as the first <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>fountain, head,</HI> or root of sin and misery, so Christ is the fountain and head of righteousness and life. And having thus shewed, wherein they agreed, he comes now to shew, wherein they differ: And that he mani∣fests by these positions. <HI>1.</HI> The sin of <HI>Adam</HI> is not so pernicious, as the righ∣teousness of Christ (which is freely given) is beneficial. For if the offence of the first <HI>Adam</HI> brought forth <HI>death</HI> to all that are naturally propagated of him, much more shall the free grace of God convey <HI>life</HI> to all those who are in Christ by Faith, and born of him after the Spirit. <HI>2.</HI> Though from <HI>Adams</HI> sinning, the guilt of his <HI>one offence</HI> redounds to the condemnation of many, yet the <HI>free gift</HI> of God, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>righteousness of Christ,</HI> redounds to the justification of many, not only from the guilt of that <HI>first sin,</HI> but of all other actual sins also. <HI>3.</HI> As by one offence death reigned over all mankind, much more shall they, who by Faith are united to Christ, and so participate of his abundant grace, and the free gift of his righteousness, be made partakers of everlasting life, wherein they shall reign with Him in glory. As therefore by one offence<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">v. 18. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] supple <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>res processit</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. &amp;c. vide <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> guilt came upon all naturally descended of <HI>Adam</HI> to their <HI>condemnation,</HI> so by the righteousness and perfect obe∣dience of <HI>one, viz.</HI> of Jesus Christ, (the meritorious cause of pardon), <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>absolution</HI> come upon all that believe in him, and are born again by his Spirit to their justification. <HI>From Ver. 12, to 20.</HI></P>
<P>But here then it may be objected. If we are made righteous only by the righteousness of Christ, To what end was the Law given to the <HI>Israelites</HI> by <HI>Moses?</HI> He answers, It was not given that we should seek to be justified by it; But <HI>1.</HI> That sin <HI>might abound</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Per legem magis innotuit pec∣catum.</NOTE>, that is, be more clearly manifested to us, to be sin, and exceeding odious. <HI>2.</HI> That grace might <HI>super-abound,</HI> that is, might ap∣pear much more conspicuous and glorious in pardoning sin, and subduing of it. That as the power of sin appear'd in making us liable both to <HI>temporal</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> death, so might the power of grace appear, in beginning in us a spiritual life here, and bringing us to an eternal life in glory hereafter, through the righteousness of Christ held forth in the Gospel. <HI>From Ver. 20, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He comes now to shew, that <HI>this Doctrine of justification by Faith in <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="Chap."/> Christ,</HI> tends exceedingly to promote holiness. And that he may the more clearly prove it, he first answers an Objection, which some (its like) in those times were ready to make against this Doctrine. They would be apt to say, <HI>If we be justifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d freely by the grace of God, through Faith in Christ;</HI> Why may we not then freely indulge our selves in sin, that we may more <HI>inhaunce</HI> the grace of God, and make it appear more abundant and glorious in the par∣doning of us? This Objecti n the Apostle answers with detestation, shewing that this Doctrine allows no such wicked inferences, but tends altogether to promote holiness. And this be plainly proves by this argument. True Believers are <HI>dead</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mori peccato]</HI> Est ei non esse subjectum, seu non servire ei. <HI>Flac. Glass. Mori peccato]</HI> Est renunciare pec∣cato, &amp; abdicare illud. è contra <HI>vi∣vere peccato</HI> est fraenum laxare &amp; in∣dulgere peccato ut in carne domini∣um acquirat.</NOTE> <HI>to sin,</HI> (that is, being partakers of the Spi∣rit of Christ they renounce it, and labour to mortifie it) therefore they cannot live in it. And this he shews is signified by their <HI>Baptism,</HI> whereby they are <HI>incorpo∣rated into Christ,</HI> and testifie their communion with him; <HI>1.</HI> In <HI>his death;</HI> so that they are to imitate his death by dying unto sin, and by mortifying their cor∣ruptions. <HI>2.</HI> In <HI>his burial,</HI> being buried with him in Baptism unto a similitude of his death and burial, by the immersion of the whole body into the water, (a custom much us'd in hot Countries); and there∣fore
<PB N="236" REF="128"/> they are obliged to endeavour the <HI>burial of the old man,</HI> and to labour to abolish the body of sin. <HI>3.</HI> In <HI>his resurrection,</HI> therefore they are to imitate him by rising to newness of life. And as <HI>plants ingrafted,</HI> receive juice and moisture from the <HI>stock,</HI> so Believers being by Baptism implanted into Christ, do by virtue of their union with him, obtain power to kill sin, and to dye to it, in <HI>conformity to his death;</HI> and to rise from death in sin to newness of life, in <HI>conformity to his resurrection.</HI> And so the the old man<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Veterem hominem apellat non naturam sed pravam mentem. <HI>Theod.</HI></NOTE> is <HI>crucified</HI> with Christ, he having by his merits obtained not only remission of sins, but also the spirit of regeneration for Believers, that the<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">viz. Habitual corruption com∣pacted as it were into one monstrous body prepared with all its members to commit actual sins.</NOTE> body of sin may be destroyed, and they freed and delivered from its power, as those that are dead are no longer subject to the power of any man. And if they be conformed to Christ in his death, there is no doubt but they shall have a spiritual life here, and enjoy with him a celestial and ever∣lasting life hereafter. And as Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more, so likewise it shall be with his members. For he died once to make atonement for sin<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Christus mortuus est peccato, illud expiando: nos morimur peccato, illud destruendo. <HI>Illyr.</HI></NOTE>, and to ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lish it.

<P>Having shewed how this Doctrine tends to promote holiness, he comes now to exhort those who are <HI>justified by Faith,</HI> to endeavour to be holy, and to take care that <HI>sin</HI> get not any dominion over them, and that they obey it not by yeilding to the sinful lusts, inclinations, and motions of the flesh, nor employ the faculties and powers of their souls, or the members of their bodies in the service of sin and the Devil, but in the service of God, who hath so graciously rais'd them by the power of his grace from the death of sin, and endowed them with the life of righteousness through Faith in Christ Jesus. And he tells them, that if they did contend and strive duly against sin, it should not have dominion over them, because they are not under the Law as a <HI>Covenant of works,</HI> exacting perfect obedience, and ministring no strength to perform it; but under a Covenant of grace in Christ, which ministers strength to resist sin, and to overcome it. Yet none ought to infer from hence, that because they are not under the Law as a <HI>Covenant,</HI> therefore they are not under it as a <HI>rule;</HI> or that because they are under the Covenant of grace, therefore they may indulge themselves in sin, seeing the con∣trary plainly follows thereupon. For standing in the relation of servants to God, they must not serve sin; for they must of necessity be the servants to him whom they obey, and must receive a reward proportionable to the work they do. If they be the servants of sin<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">Servi estis cui obeditis, sive peccati (quod ducit) ad mortem sive obedientiae (quae ducit) ad ju∣stitiam:</NOTE>, it will bring upon them eternal death; if they be the servants of obedience, that is, obe∣dient servants to God, it will bring them the reward of righteousness, which is <HI>eternal life.</HI> Indeed before their conversion, he acknowledges, they did serve sin, but (through the grace of God) the time of that bondage was past, and now they had begun sincerely to obey that <HI>form of sound Doctrine,</HI> into which they were led by <HI>them,</HI> that first preached the Gospel unto them<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">In quam traducti estis ab iis qui Evangelium vobis annunciarunt. <HI>Vatablus.</HI> vide etiam <HI>Pisc.</HI> in loc. vide 2 Tim. 1.13.</NOTE>. Therefore being made free from the <HI>slavery of sin,</HI> they were now become servants to <HI>righteousness.</HI> He tells them, he speaks plainly to them in an earthly similitude (because of the weakness of their understandings in spi∣ritual
<PB N="237" REF="128"/> matters, <HI>Joh. 3.12.</HI>), and accordingly declares unto them, that is was but equal, that as before they had obeyed sin, and yeilded up their members to be servants to uncleanness and iniquity, even to the acting of all unrighteousness; so now they should yeild their members to be servants to righteousness, that they may attain to a high degree of sanctification. As therefore when they served sin they were void of righteousness, (<HI>that</HI> had no whit of their service), so now it is but equal, that seeing they are servants of righteousness, they should be free from sin, and not servants at all unto it. Lastly, he minds them of the sad na∣ture of the <HI>service</HI> of sin, it being for the time past <HI>unprofitable,</HI> for the time present <HI>shameful,</HI> and for the time to come <HI>deadly.</HI> But they that have gain'd liberty from the bondage of sin, and are become servants unto God, he shews, have great benefit thereby. For they will daily grow more and more in grace and holiness, and at last shall obtain eternal life. So that the <HI>wages, due reward,</HI> and <HI>end</HI> of sin, is death; but <HI>life eternal</HI> is the <HI>end</HI> of righteousness; not as its <HI>wages,</HI> but as a <HI>gift</HI> freely given by God, upon the account of the merit and intercession of Christ. <HI>From Ver. 12. to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He comes now to answer another Objection which the Jews would be apt to <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="Chap."/> make against this Doctrine. They might say, How can eternal life belong to <HI>you Christians,</HI> seeing you do not observe the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and so sin contemptuously against God. Nay not only the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who are converted to Christianity, are by you permitted to neglect <HI>Circumcision,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>[Act. 15.],</HI> but the converted <HI>Jews</HI> are taught by you also, that they need not observe the Law of <HI>Moses, [see Act. 21.21.]?</HI> To this the Apostle answers, that they who believe in Christ are now no longer under the <HI>Mosaical Paedagogy,</HI> or tied to observe the Ceremonial Rites; which he proves by this general position, <HI>that the Law hath power over a man as long as it</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] Quam∣diu lex vivit, i. e.

<P>Yet lest what he had said might be ill understood, he comes now to Apologize for the holiness of the Law, and to answer an Objection which he foresaw some might be apt to make against this discourse. Some might say, If vicious motions be stirred up by the Law, then the Law may seem to be the cause of sin. He answers, That the Law manifests and discovers sin, and therefore cannot work it. For as for his own particular, he should not so exactly have known the <HI>very desires</HI> of the heart to be <HI>sin,</HI> had not he by a more attentive consideration of the Tenth Commandment found that they were so. But when he knew this <HI>ori∣ginal corruption,</HI> or the inward depravation of his nature, taking occasion by the Law, that is, being stirred up, and more irritated by the prohibition of it, brought forth all the vicious motions of Concupiscence<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">The Schoolmen distinguish between the first motions of concu∣piscence which have not the consent of the Will, which they call <HI>Concu¦piscentiam informem;</HI> and those mo∣tions of concupiscence whereunto the Will consenteth, which they call <HI>Con∣cupiscentiam formatam.</HI></NOTE> in him. Indeed whilst he knew not the Law, (that is, the exact holiness and purity it required), this kind of sin lay as it were dead in him, that is, was not known to him to be sin, neither did it terrifie his Conscience: But after the Law came to be better known by him, he found, by the prohibition of the Law, his appetite to sin was more increased and enraged. Formerly, when he liv'd a Pha∣risee, and had the Law, but did not sufficiently consider it, nor the exactness and perfection it required, he seem'd to himself to be alive<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg">Concedimus Apostolum, à v. 7. ad 14. agere de homine non re∣nato.

Then he understood these <HI>two things,</HI> which he knew not before: <HI>1.</HI> The proper end and use of the Law, which was ordain'd to give life to them that should perfectly keep it. <HI>2.</HI> The accidental effect of it, <HI>viz.</HI> that through the corruption of man, it became a cause of death to him, by irritating his inward corruption. He further shews, that <HI>sin,</HI> or the depraved nature in him, excited him to disobey the Law by suggesting to him, it was more pleasant to indulge himself in sin, and so seducing him, made him liable to the punishment of it, which is death. However the Law, he acknowledges, is in its self <HI>holy, just,</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> But some might then object, How can <HI>that</HI> which is in it self <HI>good,</HI> be a cause of death to any man? He an∣swers, 'Tis so only <HI>accidentally,</HI> not of it self, but through the corruption of mans nature, which therein manifests it self to be more superlatively evil and vile, by being irritated by so holy a Law, and so being the cause of actual sins, and of death. <HI>From Ver. 7. to 14.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, he shews, how he himself was grieved with the <HI>remainders</HI> of corruption, which he found in himself, even after he was delivered from the <HI>dominion</HI> thereof, and how much he strove against them, and how he got the victory over them, only by Christ. He complains, he consisted of a <HI>regenerate</HI> and an <HI>unregenerate</HI> part; the one was irritated by the Law of God, the other sweetly complied with it; from which two principles, arose a spiritual combate in him, <HI>(see Gal. 5.17),</HI> which he comes now to describe. And first he acknowledges, that the Law was <HI>spiritual,</HI> but when he look'd upon himself, and compar'd the
<PB N="239" REF="129"/> imperfection of his obedience with the spiritualness of the Law, he was compell'd to acknowledg, that he was still in part <HI>carnal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>regenerate</HI> are in part <HI>carnal,</HI> because they have <HI>inchoatam, non ple∣nam liberationem.</HI></NOTE>, (namely, in respect of the remainders of corruption that were in him), and <HI>sold under sin,</HI> not as if he were willingly obedient to it, but as one that against his desire and will, was of∣ten instigated by it, and sometimes over-power'd by the tyranny of it, and car∣ried away whither he would not, and from which he was not yet able wholly to free himself. For that (says he) which sometimes I do, being over-power'd by the force of corruption, and violence of temptation; I do not allow, or approve in my renewed judgment, but utterly condemn, before those corrupt passions are stir∣red in me; and the <HI>good</HI> which I will and approve, that I do not, in such per∣fection as I gladly would. For I would perform perfect obedience to the Law, but I find that in many things I fall short and offend, yea sometimes am hurried into the evil, which I am utterly averse from, when I am not thus assaulted. So that therein I shew and manifest, that I approve and own the <HI>Law</HI> to be good, and a perfect rule of righteousness. <HI>From Ver. 14. to 17.</HI></P>
<P>He further shews he stood not in fear of being rejected of God, for those remain∣ders of corruption in him, so long as he heartily strove against them, and endeavoured to subdue them. For God judgeth of his Children, that are thus exercis'd be∣tween <HI>flesh</HI> and <HI>spirit,</HI> according to the better and sounder part in them, unto which they do willingly cleave and adhere, and not according to the other (the flesh) which they do resist and combate against<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dicit se se∣cundum re∣pugnantia principia, repugnantia habere studia. <HI>Tolet.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Ver. 17.</HI></P>
<P>He acknowledges, that in his nature, so far as it is yet corrupt and unrenewed, there dwells no spiritual good, by which he can please God; and consequently not so much as power to will any good. Indeed he found his renewed will somewhat inclining to good, but the corruption yet remaining in him, often hindred the exe∣cution of those good motions and inclinations, insomuch that he could not but ac∣cuse himself of manifold omissions of good, and commissions of evil, which he was heartily sorry and displeased with himself for: so that it was not <HI>he as renew∣ed,</HI> but as over-power'd by this in-dwelling corruption, that did this evil. And further he declares, that when he was ready to do good, he found the pravity of nature present with him, as a Law over-swaying, and forcing, and inclining him to evil; yet, according to his renew'd nature, (called the <HI>inward man</HI> be∣cause hidden, and concealed from the eyes of man), he delighted in the Law of God. <HI>From Ver. 17. to 22.</HI></P>
<P>But he tells them, he had sad experience of another Law, <HI>viz.</HI> the power of sin, yet exerting it self in him, and warring and fighting against the Law of God, by which his <HI>inward</HI> and <HI>renewed man</HI> was guided, (and with the purity and spirituality whereof it was delighted), and endeavouring to captivate him unto evil. <HI>Ver. 23.</HI></P>
<P>Ʋnder a feeling of this misery, he cries out, <HI>O that I were delivered from these carnal lusts, that are a death to me! O that I were out of this ani∣mal and terrestrial life! O that I were delivered from this body subject to death!</HI> for till then I cannot expect to be delivered from the remainders of sin, and the <HI>old man,</HI> (which he here calls the body of death, <HI>see Rom. 6.6.</HI>), Yet for all this he does not faint and despond, but blesses God who <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> his Son, delivers him from the curse of the Law, and the dominion of sin, and will perfect his deliverance from all the power of it in his due time. At last he concludes, that in this his present regenerate condition; though with his mind, <HI>that is,</HI> with that part that is renewed in him, he serves the Law of God, yet by reason of the corruption that remains in him, (against which he did strive),
<PB N="240" REF="130"/> he is sometimes tempted and seduced to the commitment of sin. <HI>From Ver. 23 to the end.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="Chap."/> He comes now to shew, that this Doctrine of <HI>justification by Faith in Christ</HI> affords Believers strong ground of <HI>comfort</HI> against all fear of evil or punishment, to be endured after this life; which a sense of the imperfection of their sanctification, and of sin dwelling in them, might strike them with. And under this Head, (from <HI>v. 1.</HI> to <HI>9.</HI>), he shews, <HI>1.</HI> That this <HI>consolation, viz.</HI> security to be freed from Condem∣nation, is proper and peculiar to justified persons, only; who being implanted into Christ by Faith, endeavour to be more and more holy, and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh, but follow the guidance of the Spirit of God. For the power of the quick∣ning Spirit of Christ, (which rules in the hearts of <HI>Believers</HI> as a Law, dicta∣ting to them what they ought to do), frees <HI>them</HI> and <HI>himself</HI> in particular, from the reigning power of sin, the wages whereof is death: From neither of which the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was able to rescue any man. For the Law cannot justi∣fie any man now, since mans transgression of it, but it only condemns and works wrath; it shews sin, it cannot abolish it. What therefore the <HI>Law</HI> cannot do by reason of mans first transgression thereof, and his present pravity of nature, God was pleas'd to do, by sending his Son (who took on him our true human nature, yet not a sinful nature, though he had the likeness of it, in being subject to our infirmities), to be made a Sacrifice for us on the Cross, and there he condemn∣ed sin in the flesh of his Son, and did exact of him the pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shment due to it, that we believing <HI>in him</HI> might be justified, and reckoned as those, that have performed perfect obedience to the Law; and that, by the inchoation of sincere E∣vangelical obedience to the Law in us, we might be enabled to walk after the Spirit, and not after the flesh. For those that are in their corrupt and natural estate do savour only fleshly things, which lead and bring a man to death, but they that are regenerate do savour spiritual things, which lead to everlasting life and peace. For the wisdom of the flesh, or the carnal mind, is enmity against God, there being a natural repugnancy in it to submit it self to his will. There∣fore they that are in their carnal and corrupt estate, and follow the lust and con∣cupiscence of the flesh, cannot please God till they be converted and changed. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 9.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2ly.</HI> He addresses himself to the <HI>Believing Romans,</HI> applying this consolation <HI>of immunity from condemnation</HI> unto them, who being united to Christ by Faith, have the Spirit of Christ, by his gracious operations dwel∣ling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Non tanquam hospes sed indi∣gena perpetuus [Joh. 14.16.] qui in domo imperat.</NOTE> in them. And if Christ be in them by his Spirit, though their body be mortal and subject to death, (by reason of sin, which still dwells in them), yet their <HI>spirits</HI> or <HI>souls</HI> are made partakers of <HI>eternal life initial,</HI> by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and a work of sanctification begun in them, which Christ, who hath begun it will carry on. And if the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Christ dwell in them, he will never leave his habitation, but will raise their bo∣dies to life again at the last day, as his own body was raised from the dead by the power of God. <HI>From Ver. 9. to 12.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3ly.</HI> He shews from <HI>ver. 12.</HI> to <HI>17.</HI> what use they are to make of this Doctrine, (which affords so great consolation), namely, to engage themselves with all serious∣ness to subdue the flesh, and to be more and more holy. For if they live after the flesh they shall <HI>dye,</HI> not only a <HI>temporal</HI> but an <HI>eternal</HI> death; but if they through the grace and assistance of the Spirit, do subdue and mortifie the sinful lusts of the flesh, they shall <HI>live,</HI> not only a spiritual life here, but an eternal life in glory here∣after. And he further tells them, that all that follow the guidance of the Spi∣rit of God do evidence themselves to be the Children of God.

<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> He concludes this Argument of his, for <HI>justification by Faith,</HI> with a holy insultation, and triumphing in Christ against all accusations and tribulations which the <HI>Devil</HI> or the <HI>World</HI> might be able to bring upon justified persons; arguing in this manner: If God declare himself to be so much for us, as that he hath <HI>chosen, called, justified, sanctified,</HI> and intends to <HI>glorifie</HI> us hereafter, who shall be able to hurt us? If God spared not his only begotten Son, but gave him over to death for all us who believe in him, we have no cause to fear but he will give us whatsoever else is good for us, and may tend to promote our Sal∣vation. And to pursue this Argument further, he asks, Who can implead any of Gods Elect, as Satan and their own Consciences (sometimes) are apt to do? If they do, he replies, It is God that justifies<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="marg">Here the importance of the word <HI>justification</HI> is shewn, that it signifies nothing else but a judicial absolution, or declaring one to be free from guilt.</NOTE>, ac∣quits and absolves them from condemnation for the sake of Christ.

He asks, What can separate them from that love wherewith Christ hath loved them, and manifested toward them, in doing all this for them? Shall tribulation, or persecution, or
<PB N="243" REF="131"/> any afflictions, which are only trials of Faith? No, none of them can hinder them from enjoying the full effect and sweet sense of Christs love, though such trials have been the lot of Gods people, both under the Old and New Testament. So that they may apply the words of <HI>David</HI> in <HI>Psal. 44, 22.</HI> unto themselves, saying, <HI>For thy sake, O Lord, we are persecuted continually, and are in daily expectation of death, and are used as if we were sheep destinated to the slaughter;</HI> nevertheless in all these conflicts we do more then overcome, through Christ helping of us; our graces being strengthned thereby, and our reward in∣creased. He concludes that he is perswaded, that neither the pleasures of life, nor the terrors of death, nor evil Angels, nor any of the powers and principalities of this world, nor evils present, nor any that can happen to us hereafter, nor heighth of prosperity, nor depth of adversity, nor any thing else, can separate us from the love of God, wherewith he loves us; being by Faith united to Christ. For his love is founded on an immutable foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> the infinite merit of his Son. <HI>From Ver. 31. to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He further confirms the assertion, <HI>that justification is by Faith in Christ, <MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="Chap."/> and not by the works of the Law,</HI> from the experience of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> who seeking justification by works, and not by Faith in Christ, found it not, and were therefore cast off; and from the experience of the <HI>believing Gentiles,</HI> who not trusting in their own works, fled by Faith to Christ for justification, and so obtain'd it. And he answers <HI>four Objections,</HI> which he foresaw would be made against what he should say touching the rejection of the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> Some would perhaps say, that what he spake upon this Argument, savour'd of <HI>ill will</HI> and <HI>disaffection</HI> to his own Nation.

<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="Chap."/> He further prosecutes this Argument of the <HI>Jews temporary rejection;</HI> shew∣ing this to be the cause thereof, that they foolishly and stubbornly rejected the righteousness which God presents in the Gospel. And being first to convince them of their folly therein, lest they should think he spake out of disaffection to his own Nation, he professes he was so far from it, that he heartily prayed to God for their conversion and salvation. For he could not but bear them record, that very many of them had a zeal, <HI>in their way,</HI> to please God, but for want of true knowledg they were greatly mistaken. For being unsatisfied of Gods way of ju∣stifying sinners, by the <HI>righteousness of Christ</HI> apprehended by Faith, and de∣siring and endeavouring to establish <HI>a way of righteousness</HI> by <HI>their own works</HI> and <HI>obedience to the Law,</HI> they have refused to submit to Gods way of justifica∣tion, which is <HI>by Faith in Christ.</HI> He tells them, they should have considered, that Christ is <HI>the end of the Law,</HI> that is, that all the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of the Law prefigured him, and had reference unto him as their scope and end; and that the <HI>moral Law</HI> convincing men of their sins, and condemning them for them, did plainly shew, that the expiation of sin could no where he found but in the sacrifice of Christ, and therefore righteousness must be sought by Faith in him, and not by the Law. For <HI>Moses</HI> when he commended the Law to the people, <HI>Deut. 30.11,</HI> &amp;c. spake in this wise; <HI>This is the commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldst say, who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it down unto us, that we may hear it and do it. Neither is it be∣yond the sea, that thou should say, who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may know it and obey it: but the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth,</HI> (that is, thou canst not plead ignorance, for this word is fully declar'd to thee, and thou hast it daily in thy mouth) <HI>and in thy heart,</HI> (thou understandest sufficiently what the Lord requires of thee), that thou mayest do it. It remains therefore, that thou take care fully and ex∣actly to perform it. For the man that doth all things prescribed in the Law <HI>ex∣actly</HI> and <HI>perfectly,</HI> without ever failing in any one particular, shall <HI>live</HI> there∣by: And on these, and no other terms doth the <HI>Law</HI> promise eternal life, which now are not possible to be perform'd by any meer man since <HI>Adams</HI> fall. But as for the <HI>Gospel</HI> which presents justification by Faith, he tells them, that if he may bring it in speaking, in allusion to <HI>Moses,</HI> they should find it would speak in this wise: <HI>Say not in thine heart,</HI> (nor give way to any such vile thoughts), <HI>Who shall ascend into heaven</HI> to bring the <HI>Messias</HI> down from thence, that we may believe in him and obey him? For he is already come from heaven, and actu∣ally exhibited and offered to thee, and if thou wilt be saved, 'tis necessary thou believe that this Jesus is the true <HI>Messias,</HI> sent of God; and not only so, but that being crucified here by wicked men, and put to death, and laid in the grave, he rose again the third day, and ascended to the right hand of his Father, there to intercede for us. And say not thou in thy heart, <HI>Who shall descend into the deep,</HI> (that is, into the grave), to bring Christ again from the dead? For as he died for the sins of men, so he is assuredly risen again for their justi∣fication. And further, he shews, 'tis agreeable to the <HI>righteousness which is by Faith,</HI> in allusion to what <HI>Moses</HI> said, to speak thus. The Gospel (which holds forth all these things concerning Christ, and by which men are exhorted, and brought to believe), is openly proclaim'd and preached by the Apostles, and other Ministers of Christ (so that none of you can reasonably pretend ignorance) this <HI>word,</HI> I say, is come near unto you, and so plainly declar'd that you may apprehend it in your understandings, believe it in your hearts, and confess it with your mouths<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Verbum hoc in ore tuo] scil. ut <HI>ore confitearis.</HI> Et in corde tuo] scil. ut <HI>corde credas. Piscat.</HI></NOTE>. And he that shall sincerely confess with his mouth, and own Jesus Christ for his Lord and Saviour, <HI>[see Gal. 2.20. 1 Tim. 1.15.],</HI> and with his heart believe in him, and depend on the merits of his death ond passion, and believe also his resurrection, shall certainly be saved. For <HI>Faith</HI> is the means whereby the <HI>righteousness</HI> of Christ is received and made ours; and a <HI>sincere
<PB N="249" REF="134"/> confession</HI> of Christ is an effect and fruit of that Faith, and so a way<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Confessio est via quâ pervenitur ad vitam ae∣ternam. <HI>Beza.</HI></NOTE> un∣to eternal salvation. And that there is a real connexion between <HI>true Faith in Christ,</HI> and <HI>eternal salvation,</HI> (so that he that hath the one, shall not fail of the other), he proves from <HI>Isa. 28.16.</HI> where the Prophet saith, <HI>he that be∣lieveth, [viz.</HI> in Christ the precious Corner-stone laid in Sion] <HI>shall not be ashamed,</HI> nor frustrated of his hope and expectation. And there is no difference between <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI> in this matter. For he that is Lord over all, is rich in his mercy to all, that truly worship him, and call upon him, with a true Faith and Contrition, as he proves from the testimony of the Prophet <HI>Joel, ch. 2.32.</HI> which promise belongs to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> as well as to the <HI>Jews,</HI> as may appear from <HI>Act. 2.21.

<P>Having thus shewed, that the Promise is universal, that whosoever call upon the Lord in a due manner shall be saved, whether they be <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> hence he inferreth, that the Gospel must be preached to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and that himself and his fellow Apostles did nothing but what was agreeable to the will of God in so doing. This he proves by an heap of arguments clapt together after this manner. <HI>Those that</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sorites.</HI> Nemo invocatur in quem non creditur; Fides autem ex auditu.

<P>But here he supposes the <HI>Jews</HI> (who could not abide to hear the Gospel should be preached to the <HI>Gentiles</HI>) might object, If the preaching of the Gospel to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> be of God, how comes it to pass, that so few of them obey it? To this he answers, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were not to be offended hereat. For as the sending of the Apostles to preach the Gospel was foretold in the Scripture as he had proved, so the incredulity of the greatest part of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and the small fruit and effect of the Apostles labours was foretold also, in those words of <HI>Isa. 53.1. Lord who hath believed our report?</HI> that is, how few have been perswa∣ded, and wrought upon by our preaching. It follows therefore, that the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> could not in an ordinary way be otherwise wrought, than by hear∣ing the Gospel preached<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">v. 17.

He answers, that not <HI>a few only</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> have heard it; for what was said by <HI>David, Psal. 19.4.</HI> concern∣ing the preaching of the heavens, may well be said concerning the preaching of the Apostles; <HI>their sound</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">The He∣brew Text hath <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> their line, the Septuagint <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> their sound.

<PB N="241" REF="135"/> for that which is of <HI>grace</HI> is not of <HI>works. Grace</HI> and <HI>works</HI> (as causes) mutually destroy each other.

If therefore the <HI>Election</HI> be meerly of grace, God ought to have all the glory; If it be upon the merit of works foreseen, then corrupt flesh will boast.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2ly.</HI> His second Inference is this, that though the generality of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> (who are so after the flesh), seeking justification and salvation by their own righ∣teousness, and observance of the Law, (and not in a right manner), have not obtain'd it, <HI>(see ch. 9.31.);</HI> yet the <HI>elect</HI> among them, seeking it in a <HI>Gos∣pel-way, by Faith in Christ</HI> have obtain'd it; and the <HI>rest</HI> (being left to themselves and the power of the Devil) by the just judgment of God, are blinded and hardned even unto this day<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Cohaerent haec verba cum ver∣bo <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in fine, v. 7.</NOTE>; so that in them is accomplished what the Prophet <HI>Isaiah [ch. 29 10. &amp; 6.9.]</HI> long ago prophesied of those <HI>Israelites,</HI> who having first hardned their own hearts against God, should be after given up by God to a further obduration; insomuch that the <HI>spirit of slum∣ber</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Spiritum soporis</HI>] i. e. animum somnolentum &amp; quasi veterno op∣pressum adeoque omni sensu priva∣tum.</NOTE> should fall upon them, and they should have eyes and ears, wherewith (as the case stood with them) they could neither see nor hear; that is, such a mind where∣with they could not understand the things that concern'd their peace.

<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Having thus shewed, that the <HI>rejection</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> is not <HI>total,</HI> he comes now to shew, it is not <HI>final,</HI> and that they shall be <HI>generally called</HI> before the end of the world, that both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> may make one sheepfold, and one flock under Christ Jesus the great Shepherd. To prove this point, he brings divers Arguments for the comfort of the poor <HI>Jews,</HI> and inserts an Admonition to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> not to insult over them. <HI>From Ver. 17, to 23.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> He shews them, that the <HI>Jews</HI> have not so stumbled, that they should fall and never rise again; but God in his righteous judgment hath permitted them to fall, that they having obstinately refused the Gospel, it might be preached to the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and the calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and their receiving of the Gospel, he will in his infinite wisdom make use of, to make the <HI>Jews</HI> jealous, and emulous,

<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> He shews, that he himself is an Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and did earnestly desire to make his ministry glorious, in converting as many of them as he could, and the rather, that he might provoke his own Nation, not to suffer the <HI>Gen∣tiles alone</HI> to enjoy the priviledges of the Sons of God, but that <HI>they</HI> would join themselves unto them, that so <HI>they</HI> also might be saved.

<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> That he might further urge his Argument which he had made use of at <HI>v. 12.</HI> he shews, That if the <HI>casting off</HI> of the contumacious <HI>Jews</HI> be a means of sending the Gospel to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and so of bringing <HI>them</HI> to Faith in Christ, (whereby they obtain pardon of their sins, and reconciliation with God), What a miracle of mercy will the <HI>re-assuming</HI> of them again into Gods favour be, (upon their embracing of Christ), even as great, and as fit to work upon the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and make them rejoice, as if they should see their dear friends (whom they entirely loved) raised from the dead again<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="marg">Perinde erit ac si mor∣tuus quis ad vitam revocetur. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] summum gaudium.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> He uses another Argument, taken from the relation of the <HI>Jews</HI> to the Covenant made with their Fathers, arguing after his manner: The holy Nation; that is, the Nation which is Gods peculiar people, and <HI>federally holy,</HI> cannot be cast off for ever; but the <HI>Jews</HI> are an holy Nation, which he proveth, because they are descended of <HI>holy Parents;</HI> and if any doubt of that, he proves it by two similitudes, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>first-fruits,</HI> and <HI>root,</HI> which being <HI>holy</HI> make the <HI>lump,</HI> and the <HI>branches</HI> holy. Concerning the <HI>first fruits,</HI> the Law is set down <HI>Lev. 23.</HI> by which the people were not permitted to put sickle into their corn till they had offered a <HI>sheaf</HI> to the Lord, and then it was lawful for them to reap it; and when they had inn'd their Corn, they might not eat of it, till they had offered <HI>two loaves</HI> to the Lord, and then was their whole <HI>lump</HI> sanctified, and made lawfull for them to eat. Now he shews, that the Patriarchs, <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were as the <HI>first-fruits,</HI> and the people of the <HI>Jews</HI> were as the lump. The <HI>Jews</HI> therefore being descended from those holy Patriarchs, to whom and their seed the Covenant is made, <HI>[I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed],</HI> have still a relation to that Covenant made with their Fathers; and so their case is not desperate. And the same is the sense of the other similitude. As the <HI>branches</HI> follow the nature of the <HI>root,</HI> so do the <HI>Jews</HI> the condition of those holy Patriarchs, in regard of the outward priviledges of the Covenant; that is, not in respect of <HI>personal</HI> and <HI>inherent,</HI> but <HI>faederal</HI> and <HI>external</HI> holiness, so as they may expect to be owned by God as his visible Church. <HI>From Ver. 11, to 17.</HI></P>
<P>But here some <HI>Gentile</HI> might object, We acknowledg the <HI>root</HI> of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
<PB N="257" REF="136"/> Nation to be holy, but what good doth the holiness of the root to these incredulous branches, that are now broken off, and rejected of God? The Apostle answers, That some of the branches are indeed broken off from the sweet <HI>Olive-tree,</HI> (that is, from the Church of the holy Patriarchs); and the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that are as a wild Olive, and not sprung from that holy root, are by Faith grafted in among the branches that remain in the sweet Olive, and so imitating the Faith of the holy Patriarchs, are made <HI>one Church</HI> with them, and thereby partake of the root and fatness of the <HI>sweet Olive,</HI> that is, of the Doctrine and grace of Christ, and all the spi∣ritual benefits and priviledges which he conferreth on his Church. But yet seeing the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are, of <HI>meer grace,</HI> grafted in, (being before in a forlorn condi∣tion), they should not disdainfully boast, or insult over the branches that are broken off, <HI>viz.</HI> the incredulous <HI>Jews;</HI> for they are <HI>natural</HI> branches of that body and root, which bears the believing <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and have an outward fellowship with the Olive; that is, they are the natural Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who <HI>in some degree</HI> is despised, when his Children are despised; so that if they insult over these branches, they do in a manner lift up themselves against the root, which bore these branches, even against <HI>Abraham</HI> himself, who is call'd the root of this Olive-tree, in respect, that he is the Parent from which the <HI>Jews</HI> naturally de∣scend, and in respect of the Covenant that God made with him. And further, they should consider, that this root doth bear the believing <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and not <HI>they</HI> the root. The Church of the <HI>Jews</HI> is our <HI>Mother-Church; Salvation is of the Jews,</HI> as our Saviour speaks, <HI>Joh. 4.22.</HI> The <HI>Gentiles</HI> are not called to make a <HI>several</HI> Church by themselves; neither do they so: For there is but <HI>one Church;</HI> but they are called to be members of the Church of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as Christ saith, <HI>Joh. 10.16. I have other sheep which are not yet of this fold,</HI> (that is, the Elect among the <HI>Gentiles), them I must bring into this fold, that there may be one fold,</HI> (or Church), <HI>and one shepherd.</HI> But the Christian <HI>Gentile</HI> might here again object, that though the <HI>Jew</HI> be the <HI>natu∣ral Olive,</HI> and the <HI>Gentile</HI> the <HI>wild Olive;</HI> yet the <HI>Jews</HI> are broken off, that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> might be grafted in. He answers, The proper cause of the breaking off of the <HI>Jews,</HI> was their infidelity, and not the coming in of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> for they came in by accident; and the proper cause of the coming in, and the present standing of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> is their <HI>Faith:</HI> Therefore they should not be high-minded, but fear, and accordingly look to their standing. And as a man that is on the top of a tree brags not of his height, but looks to his hold, so ought they. For if God spared not the natural branches, but proceeded with so much severity against his own people the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Gentiles</HI> have no reason to expect less severity, if they take not heed to themselves. Two things therefore he inti∣mates in this matter, are especially to be considered by them. <HI>1.</HI> The severity of God against the incredulous <HI>Jews,</HI> to whom Christ was a stone of stumbling. <HI>2.</HI> His infinite mercy and grace, in effectually calling the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to Faith in Christ, in which they are to continue<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Si permanseris in benignitate</HI>] i. e. in eo statu in quo te Deus con∣stituit per benignitatem suam, nem∣pe in fide.

He speaks to the <HI>Elect,</HI> to make them carefully look to their standing, not intimating thereby, that they should finally fall away. v. 24. <HI>Wild by Nature</HI>] Understand <HI>Nature,</HI> not as it was first made, but as it was <HI>corrupted in Adam,</HI> and so derived from him to his posterity.</NOTE> and abide; o∣therwise they also shall be cut off from the <HI>Olive,</HI> that is, the true Church. So likewise the <HI>Jews,</HI> if they con∣tinue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in again; for God is able to do it. Yea he shews, the thing is not only possible, but very probable, because God hath grafted in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that are branches of the wild Olive; and 'tis <HI>contrary to nature,</HI> to graft a wild Olive branch into a right Olive; but <HI>natural,</HI> to graft into it one of its own kind. If therefore he hath grafted in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> 'tis much more likely he will re-ingraft the <HI>Jews,</HI> that are the natural branches, (naturally descended of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> and the holy <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> with whom he made his Covenant), into their own Olive tree, from which they were cut off for their unbelief. <HI>From Ver. 17, to 25.</HI></P>
<PB N="258" REF="137"/>
<P>Having thus shewed the <HI>possibility</HI> and <HI>probability</HI> of the Calling of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he now comes to shew, the <HI>certainty</HI> of it; and takes his argument from the revelation of this <HI>mystery</HI> or <HI>secret</HI> made to himself by the Spirit of God, which he was to impart to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And accordingly tells them, he would not have them ignorant of it, Lest they should be tempted, proudly to despise the <HI>Jews</HI> as utter <HI>cast-aways.</HI> For he acquaints them, that <HI>blindness</HI> and <HI>obduration</HI> is not come upon the <HI>Jews</HI> universally, but on <HI>some</HI> of them only, and that for a certain time; namely, till a greater number of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> than ever before, shall be brought to believe in Christ, and so enter into the true Church; with the coming in of which great multitude, the <HI>Jews</HI> shall be provoked to turn to Christ; and so all <HI>Israel;</HI> that is, the <HI>generality</HI> of the <HI>Israelites</HI> shall be brought to embrace Christ, and thereby be put into a way of salvation. When therefore the <HI>fulness</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> is come in, there shall be a famous and universal calling of the <HI>Jews.</HI> And this he shews, is agreeable to the Prophesie, <HI>Isa. 59.20, 21.</HI> where the <HI>Pro∣phet,</HI> respecting the time of the coming of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> saith, <HI>The deliverer (viz.</HI> the <HI>Messias,</HI> who was typified by <HI>Cyrus) shall come to Sion;</HI> but the Apostle looking further, even to those things that were to follow the coming of Christ, by way of <HI>accommodation,</HI> saith, <HI>The Redeemer shall come out of Sion,</HI> that is, out of the midst of his Church, where he dwelleth and abideth by his Spirit, and <HI>shall effectually call the Jews.</HI> The Prophet indeed says, <HI>He shall come to them, that return from iniquity in Jacob.</HI> But the Apostle (following the <HI>Septuagint,</HI> which was understood by the <HI>Gentiles</HI>) saith, <HI>he shall turn iniquity from Jacob;</HI> and so instead of mentioning Christs coming, he speaketh of a <HI>benefit</HI> that should <HI>follow his Coming,</HI> which is, the re∣mission of sin. Now where God forgives sin, he first gives the grace of true con∣version, and therefore the <HI>Jews</HI> shall be converted. And he further shews, that this is Gods <HI>Covenant,</HI> which he will fulfill unto them, namely, to <HI>pardon their sins,</HI> and they that shall have their sins pardoned, shall be first effectually called, and so the <HI>Jews</HI> shall reap the <HI>benefit</HI> of the Covenant, when they shall feel the <HI>efficacy</HI> of it, turning their hearts to God, and perswading them to embrace Jesus Christ by Faith. <HI>From Ver. 25, to 28.</HI></P>
<P>But some might here object, What! shall the <HI>Jews</HI> be called and pardoned, that are Gods enemies, whom he hates for rejecting the Gospel? He answers, They are <HI>enemies,</HI> and yet <HI>beloved</HI> in divers respects. If we respect the <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> they are Gods enemies, and hated by him; namely, because they refuse and persecute it, spurn and kick against it; and do the more persecute and hate it for the <HI>Gentiles sake,</HI> because they see them love and embrace it, and that thereupon they are admitted into the Church. But if we respect Gods <HI>election of this people,</HI> above all other Nations, to be his <HI>peculiar</HI> people, and how they are descended of those holy Patriarchs, <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> (with whom the Lord entred into Covenant, and promised to be <HI>their God,</HI> and <HI>the God of their seed after them</HI>); in this <HI>regard</HI> they are <HI>beloved</HI> of God. For Gods special favours to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and his calling them to be his people, are such things as he will never change, or repent of. <HI>From Ver. 28, to 30.</HI></P>
<P>His last argument for the <HI>general calling</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> is this; God after a long time of disobedience received the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to mercy; therefore there is reason to think, that he will at last receive the <HI>Jews</HI> also. For (according to the rule), <HI>Of like things there is the same judgment to be made.</HI> Now the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who were formerly disobedient, have obtained mercy, by occasion of the <HI>Jews</HI> infidelity and obstinacy; God sending the Gospel to them which the <HI>Jews</HI> rejected. And as the <HI>Gentiles were</HI> disobedient, so <HI>are</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> now: as the <HI>Gentiles have</HI> obtained mercy, so <HI>shall</HI> the <HI>Jews:</HI> yet with this diffe∣rence, The <HI>Gentiles</HI> obtained mercy by the unbelief of the <HI>Jews;</HI> but the <HI>Jews</HI> shall obtain mercy, by the mercy shewed to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> being provo∣ked

<P>In the Conclusion of this discourse, he falls into an admiration of the <HI>depth</HI> of the abundant <HI>goodness</HI> of God, in bearing with the disobedience and contu∣macy of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> first, and then of the <HI>Jews;</HI> and of his <HI>wisdom</HI> in ma∣king the rejection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> a means of calling the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and of his <HI>knowledg</HI> in knowing how to work upon the obstinate <HI>Jews,</HI> by his mercy shew∣ed unto the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> He shews, his judgments and works are unsearchable, and the ways and methods of his providence past finding out. For no Creature can pierce into the mind of God, nor was ever called to be of his Counsel; <HI>see Isa. 40.13, 14. 1 Cor. 2.16.</HI> In fine, he shews, That if any shall yet complain of these dispensations of God, which he hath been speaking of, and shall think that God deals hardly with the <HI>Jews</HI> in rejecting them, and calling the <HI>Gen∣tiles;</HI> let him remember, No man can challenge God, as if he were indebted to him, or owed him any thing. He asks, Who ever gave any thing to God, that he did not first receive from him? or who can merit any thing at his hands? <HI>see Job 41.2.</HI> He owes us nothing, but what he is pleased of his own meer good∣ness, freely to promise us?

And lest any should object, that such passages as those of the Psalmist belonged not to them, he tells them, that those things that were before written, were written for our instruction, that we exercising such pa∣tience as the Scripture prescribes, especially in bearing with the infirmities of our weak Christian Brethren, might have the comforts the Scripture promiseth, and particularly be confirm'd in hope of obtaining eternal Salvation by Christ Jesus. He prays, that God who worketh patience and comfort in the hearts of his people by the holy Scriptures, would give them the grace of <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> such as Christ commands and expects from them; that all <HI>strife</HI> and <HI>discord</HI> being laid aside, they might with one heart and mouth glorifie God, who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore after the example of Christ, (who came from Heaven, and laid down his life to redeem both <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> and receives both into the arms of his mercy, intending to make them both, upon their Faith in him, to be partakers of the glory of God), he exhorts them, with all love and kindness, to receive one another into their communion, not disdaining, or rejecting, or judging one another.

He salutes also the Church in their house, that is, all the Christians in their family. He sa∣lutes <HI>Epinetus,</HI> who was converted to the Faith among the first in <HI>Achaia, [see 1 Cor. 16.15].</HI> He salutes <HI>Mary,</HI> who had done many good offices for the faithful, especially the Teachers of the Gospel.

<P>He warns to avoid those who by false Doctrine caused <HI>divisions,</HI> and by scan∣dalous Living, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffences</HI> among them. For these, he tells them, serve not the Lord, but themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and the more simple are easily deceived by their cunning words. And as f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r them, though he had already good experience of their obedience to the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel, (which was manifest to the world and in which he greatly rejoiced), yet he thought good to admonish them to continue constant, and prudently to resist con∣trary Doctrines. For as it is not sufficient for a Matron, to have been once chast, except she so continue, so 'tis not sufficient for them to have been once a pure Church, except they keep themselves from false Doctrine and false Worship.</P>

And though Satan and his instruments will seek to seduce them, and disturb their Church; yet he tells them, that G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d who is both the Lover and Author of peace, will through Christ, give them victory, when they have a while combated against the Devil and his Emissaries. Whereby he seems, either to prophesie of the conversion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire to the Faith, or that the dissentions raised among them by the subtilty and malice of the Devil and his Instruments shall be quenched; which possibly was partly effected by this Epistle, and partly by the Apostles after-labours among them. He subjoins the saluta∣tions of other Saints with him, to the Christian <HI>Romans,</HI> particularly of <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI> the Evangelist, <HI>Tertius</HI> who wrote this Epistle from his mouth, <HI>Gaius,</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f whom <HI>Act. 20.4.), Erastus, [see 2 Tim. 4.20.],</HI> and of <HI>Quartus.</HI></P>
<P>He concludes this excellent Epistle, with a solemn <HI>doxology,</HI> or thanksgiving to God, who is able to establish them in the Faith, according to the Gospel which he had preached, (the great subject whereof is Christ), and according to the Rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation of his secret Counsel concerning the Salvation of mankind, which though it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in some sort made known in the Old Testament, yet not plainly and fully until this present time; but now by the Commandment of God, and the Spirits clearing the meaning of ancient prophesies, is made known to all Nations, to bring them to submit th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mselves to the Doctrine and Directions of the Gospel: To this only wise G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he desires all glory and honour should, in and through the media∣tion of Christ Jesus, be for ever ascribed. <HI>Amen.

Because of the danger that the flock was like to be in, after his departure, partly from <HI>Wolves</HI> (that is, false Teachers, or professed persecuting enemies), part∣ly from <HI>subtil crafty Hereticks,</HI> who should arise from among themselves.

And thereby he had taught them, that by so labouring as he did, (when the case required it), they should be so far from being chargeable or burdensom to others, that they should support, and relieve the poor and weak in estate; and this much rather, than by exact∣ing wages drive any, that were tenacious, from embracing the Gospel.

And the next day, the <HI>Elders</HI> being met together in the house of <HI>James</HI> the Apostle, the <HI>Son of Alpheus, (See Mat.</HI> 15.40. <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.19. <HI>Act.</HI> 15.13.), <HI>Paul</HI> relates to them, what great things the Lord had wrought by his ministry among the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> When they heard <HI>that,</HI> they glorified God for the great suc∣cess of the Gospel. But then they acquainted him, that seve∣ral of the converted <HI>Jews,</HI> (of whom there were many thou∣sands, who, though they had received the Gospel, yet thought the Ceremonial Law must still be observed), were informed concerning him, that he not only permitted the <HI>Gentile-converts</HI> to remain uncircumcised, but perswaded the <HI>Jews</HI> living among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> (whom he had converted to the Faith), to leave off <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and the other Ceremonies of <HI>Moses</HI>'s Law. This therefore they tell him, in all probability, will be the event of this business. The <HI>Jewish</HI> Christians will hear of his being come thither, and so will come in multitudes, to see how he behaves himself in that matter, and will expect some satisfacti∣on from him therein. Therefore they advised him, that seeing there were <HI>four men</HI> there present, who having had a <HI>Naza∣rites Vow</HI> upon them, which being now accomplish'd, (<HI>see Act.</HI> 18.18.), were to perform the Ceremonies prescribed, <HI>Numb.</HI> 6.13, <HI>to</HI> 22. that he on this occasion would join himself to them, and perform those Ceremonies and Rites with them, and make provision of such Sacrifices for them as the Law injoins, that so being now freed from their Vow, they may shave their heads; and by this means the <HI>believing Jews</HI> will be perswaded that they had heard false reports of him, and that he did still ob∣serve the <HI>Mosaical</HI> Rites.

But this did not pre∣vail for his staying at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but Christ commanded him to depart from thence, tel∣ling him he would send him to preach to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had not that exception against him, and would more readily receive his Do∣ctrine.

<P>THE Apostle had soon a notable experience of Gods gra∣cious protection over him, promised unto him in that forementioned Vision. For early the very next morning above <HI>Forty Jews</HI> combin'd together, and bound themselves by an <HI>Oath,</HI> and by a <HI>Curse</HI> and execration on themselves that they would neither <HI>eat</HI> nor <HI>drink</HI> till they had killed him. And they came to the chief Priests and Elders being confident of their assistance, and acquainted them with what they had re∣solved on, and perswaded them to intreat the <HI>Colonel,</HI> that he would bring <HI>Paul</HI> down on the morrow to them, that they might further examine him, and by the way, before he could come at the Council, they resolv'd to kill him. This conspi∣racy, by the wonderful providence of God, coming to the knowledg of a <HI>Nephew</HI> of <HI>Pauls,</HI> he is by him acquainted there∣with, who thereupon desired one of the Captains of the Guard, to bring that <HI>young man</HI> to <HI>Lysias</HI> their chief Commander: which being done he acquainted him with this wicked conspiracy a∣gainst the life of his Uncle. Hereupon the <HI>Colonel</HI> presently gave order that a Guard both of Horse and Foot should be made ready against Nine of the Clock that night, and a Horse or Mule provided for <HI>Paul</HI> to ride on, and that they should convey him safe to <HI>Felix</HI> the <HI>Procurator</HI> or <HI>Governour</HI> of <HI>Judea,</HI> under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, who had his ordinary residence at <HI>Caesarea.</HI> And he wrote a Letter to the Governour concerning the Prisoner, to this sense, <HI>viz.</HI> That he found nothing brought against him, that was punishable either with <HI>death</HI> or <HI>bonds</HI> by
<PB N="286" REF="151"/> the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, and Imperial Constitutions; (for the <HI>Romans</HI> had not as yet set out any decrees against the Christians) and therefore he had rescued him out of the hands of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had treacherously conspired against his life, and had given or∣der to his accusers to appear before <HI>his Excellency,</HI> and there to implead him. <HI>Felix</HI> when he had read the Letter, command∣ed <HI>Paul</HI> should be secured in the Hall call'd <HI>Herods Hall,</HI> and wen his Accusers were come, he said, he would hear him.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Act.</HI> 23. <HI>v.</HI> 12. And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bounded themselves under a curse, saying, That they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 13. And they were more than forty which had made this conspi∣racy.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 14. And they came to the chief Priests, and Elders, and said, We have bound our selves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing untill we have slain Paul.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 15. Now therefore ye, with the Council, signifie to the chief Captain, that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would en∣quire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come neer, are ready to kill him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 16. And when Pauls sisters son heard of their laying in wait, he went and entred into the Castle, and told Paul.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 17. Then Paul called one of the Centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief Captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 18. So he took him, and brought him to the chief Captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 19. Then the chief Captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 20. And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldst bring down Paul to morrow into the Council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 21. But do not thou yeild unto them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 22. So the chief Captain let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man, that thou hast shewed these things to me.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 23. And he called unto him two Centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred Soldiers to go to Cesarea, and horsmen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 24. And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe to Felix the Governour.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 25. And he wrote a Letter after this manner,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 26. Claudius Lysias, unto the most excellent Governor Felix, sendeth greeting.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 27. This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: Then came I with an army, and rescued him, having under∣stood that he was a Roman.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 28. And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their Councell.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 29. Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their Law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death, or of bonds.</P>
<PB N="287" REF="151"/>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 30. And when it was told me, how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straitway to thee, and gave commandment to his accu∣sers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 31. Then the Soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 32. On the morrow they left the horsmen to go with him, and re∣turned to the Castle.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 33. Who when they came to Cesarea, and delivered the epistle to the Governour, presented Paul also before him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 34. And when the Governour had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 35. I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herods judgment hall.</P></Q>

<P><HI>Paul</HI> having now liberty given him to make his defence, he in the first place declares, how much it comforted him, that he was to answer before a <HI>Person</HI> whose long experience in govern∣ing the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, had furnished him with skill and abili∣ty to judg the more equally of such things as were now brought before him. Then he answers particularly to the <HI>three pretend∣ed Crimes</HI> laid to his charge. 1. For that of <HI>Sedition,</HI> he clears himself from it, by shewing, that there were but Twelve days since he came up to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and one end, among others, of his coming thither was, to declare himself a sincere wor∣shipper of the true God. Now these Twelve days were thus spent. The day after he came thither, he visited <HI>James,</HI> and the Bre∣thren, who perswaded him to purifie himself with <HI>those four men</HI> who had a Vow on them, [as we have seen <HI>Sect.</HI> 20. of this Chapter], which he consenting to do, and the day fol∣lowing,
<PB N="288" REF="152"/> (<HI>viz.</HI> on the third day, which was towards the end of the Feast, <HI>see ch.</HI> 21. <HI>v.</HI> 27.), entring into the Temple to perform those, the <HI>Jews</HI> there took him, but he was rescued out of their hands by Colonel <HI>Lysi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> The day after being the fourth day, he pleaded his cause before the Council, [<HI>Act.</HI> 23.]. On the fifth day, the <HI>Jews</HI> conspired to take away his life, <HI>Act.</HI> 23.12. That night the Colonel sent him to <HI>Antipa∣tris,</HI> whither he came on the sixth day in the evening. The next day being the seventh, he came to <HI>Caesarea,</HI> where he had been now a Prisoner <HI>five days.</HI> So that having been so many of those days in the hands of the <HI>Romans,</HI> it was not imagina∣ble he could raise (if he had had a mind to it) any such Se∣dition, or tumult at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> pretended, and char∣ged him with. Nay the contrary was very evident; for he had behaved himself very quietly, neither could any of them prove that he had raised any disturbance, either in the <HI>Temple,</HI> or in any of the <HI>Synagogues,</HI> or in the City whilst he was there. As to their <HI>second charge, viz.</HI> that of <HI>Heresie,</HI> he plainly con∣fesses▪ <HI>that after the way which they call'd Heresie, so he worship∣ped the God of his Fathers.</HI> For that way of worshipping the God of <HI>Abraham</HI> which Christ had taught, and the Christians now practised, was the way that he did use: yet therein neither he nor they set up any new Religion quite contrary to what was before owned and professed, but had the <HI>same Faith</HI> for substance, that the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> had before them. And in particular, he declares, that he believed the Doctrine of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> which the more prudent part of his Ad∣versaries, <HI>viz.</HI> those of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> professed to believe also. And this <HI>firm belief of a resurrection, and a day of judgment</HI> en∣gaged him to endeavour always to <HI>keep a good Conscience to∣wards God and man.</HI> For the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hird</HI> thing charged against him, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Profanation of the Temple;</HI> he shews, he had not been of a long time at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> before this, and now he came to bring Alms to the poor <HI>Jews</HI> there, that were converted to Christianity. He acknowledges indeed, that he went into the Temple at this time, but with no intent to profane it, but to perform t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se Rites therein, which the Law of the <HI>Jews</HI> requi∣red of such as had the <HI>Vow</HI> of the <HI>Nazarites</HI> upon them; which some <HI>Asian Jews</HI> not understanding, but misapprehending his intent, affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, that he carried <HI>Trophimus</HI> a <HI>Gentile</HI> of <HI>Ephe∣sus</HI> into the Temple. But this was utterly false, neither was there any the least ground for it, but only this, that <HI>Trophi∣mus</HI> had been seen with him in the City, <HI>see Act.</HI> 21.29. As for his being in the Temple, he acknowledges, he was there, but not with any such company as could be thought to profane it, or that could bring him under suspition of any intent to raise a Sedition. And for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e truth of these things he appeals to those t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re present of their own <HI>Sanhedrim;</HI> and desires them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fie, whether w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was brought before them, he was not dismissed with this testimony from themselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Chap. 23.9.</NOTE>,
<PB N="289" REF="152"/> that there was nothing of moment charged against him, except (which only the <HI>Sadduces</HI> will charge him with) that he pro∣fessed to believe the <HI>Resurrection of the dead,</HI> and <HI>Another life after this.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Felix</HI> discerned how things went, he would not pass any sentence for the present in this case, but put them off say∣ing, When I know more exactly the things that belong <HI>to this way, (viz.</HI> whether the Christian Religion be deroga∣tory to the Law of the <HI>Jews</HI>), and when <HI>Lysias</HI> the Comman∣der comes down (whose testimony will decide that matter con∣cerning the tumult), I will determine the business between you. But for the present he commanded the Captain of the Guard to keep <HI>Paul</HI> safe, though <HI>in free custody,</HI> so that any of his friends or acquaintants might have liberty to visit him.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Act.</HI> 24. <HI>v.</HI> 1. And after five days Ananias the high Priest descended with the elders, and with a certain Orator named Tertullus, who informed the Governour against Paul.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 2. And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, say∣ing, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very wor∣thy deeds are done unto this Nation by thy providence:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 3. We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 4. Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee, that thou wouldst hear us of thy clemency a few words.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 5. For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedi∣tion among all the Jews thorowout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarens.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 6. Who also hath gone about to profane the Temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our Law.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 7. But the chief Captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 8. Commanding his accusers to come unto thee, by examining of whom thy self mayest take knowledg of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 9. And the Jews also assented, saying, That these things were so.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 10. Then Paul, after that the Governour had beckned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a Judg unto this Nation, I do the more chearfully answer for my self:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 11. Because that thou mayest understand, that there are but yet twelve days, since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</P>
<P><HI>v</HI> 12. And they neither found me in the Temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues, nor in the City.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 13. Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 14. But this confess I unto thee, that after the way which they call heresie, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 15. And have hope towards God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and un∣just.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 16. And herein do I ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcise my self, to have always a Conscience void of offence toward God, and towards men.</P>
<PB N="290" REF="153"/>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 17. Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my Nation, and offerings:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 18. Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the Tem∣ple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 19. Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 20. Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the Council,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 21. Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</P>
<P>22. And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledg of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief Cap∣tain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 23. And he commanded a Centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister, or come unto him.</P></Q>

However, <HI>Festus</HI> being willing to gratifie the <HI>Jews,</HI> ask'd <HI>Paul</HI> if he would go to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and be tryed there in the <HI>Jewish Court</HI> about these matters. The Apostle perceiving that the Governour inclin'd to send him to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> (which course might have expos'd him to extreme hazzards), he tells him, that he was his prisoner, and that <HI>his Excellency</HI> was his <HI>pro∣per Judg;</HI> under the <HI>Roman Emperor,</HI> and not the <HI>Jews,</HI> (whom he had not wronged), and therefore it would be a piece of high injustice, to deliver him up to his enemies to be his Judges. Moreover, he tells him, that he was a <HI>Roman,</HI> and therefore might claim the priviledg of a <HI>Roman,</HI> which accordingly he

<HEAD>SECT. XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>SOME days after, <HI>King Agrippa,</HI> (Son of that <HI>Herod</HI> who slew <HI>James, Act.</HI> 12. who was King, not of <HI>Judea,</HI> but some neighbouring Province which the <HI>Romans</HI> had given him), and <HI>Bernice</HI> his Sister, came to <HI>Cesarea,</HI> to salute the new Governour. <HI>Festus</HI> relates to them <HI>Pauls</HI> case, and acquaints them, how vehemently the <HI>Jews</HI> accused him, and how earnest∣ly they desired to have had judgment against him. But he told them, he could not do it by the <HI>Roman Laws,</HI> without first hearing the cause, and bringing the <HI>accusers</HI> and <HI>accused</HI> face to face. This therefore he had done, and upon hearing of both parties, He found <HI>Paul</HI> absolutely free from all capital Crimes; and the differences between him, and the <HI>Jews,</HI> he saw, were about matters appertaining to <HI>their Religion,</HI> (which he contemptuously calls Superstition), in which he acknow∣ledges, he himself h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d little skill, and therefore had a mind to have referr'd him to the <HI>Jewish Sanhedrim,</HI> to be judged there. But the Prisoner declin'd their judgment, and <HI>appealed to Caesar.</HI> Whereupon he had remanded him to Prison, till he could conveniently send him to the Emperor at <HI>Rome. Agrippa</HI> (who was born and bred among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and in probabili∣ty understood something concerning the Christian Religion) hearing this, desired that he himself might see <HI>Paul,</HI> and hear him speak for himself. <HI>Festus</HI> readily agrees hereunto. On the morrow therefore, the Governour, with <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and <HI>Bernice,</HI> and several other persons of quality, entred the Court and place of hearing <HI>with great pomp;</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> was brought forth before them. <HI>Festus</HI> having made a short speech, wherein he shewed the occasion of their meeting, and wherefore he had brought forth the Prisoner before that illustrious Assembly. <HI>Agrippa</HI> told him he was permitted to speak for himself. Then <HI>Paul</HI> beckning with his hand to the standers by to hold their peace, and give Audience, he particularly addresses his speech to <HI>Agrippa</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Quis non delectetur concionator, concionem habere propter spem lucrandi Magnates mundi, quorum conversio multum potest ad lucrandos caeteros.

<P>And first, he declares how happy he accounted himself, that he was allowed to speak for himself before <HI>King Agrippa,</HI> whom he knew to be well skill'd in the <HI>Law,</HI> and in the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and in all the Questions and Customs of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion.

For the <HI>manner of his Life,</HI> he appeals to his Accusers own Consciences, (to whom his

And yet for <HI>believing,</HI> and <HI>expecting,</HI> and <HI>prea∣ching</HI> this, he tells the King, he was accused of the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>Then he removes an Objection which might be made against him, <HI>viz.</HI> If he were brought up a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> how came he to <HI>believe in Jesus of Nazareth,</HI> and to hope for a Resurrection by him. Surely the <HI>Pharisees</HI> never taught him so. To this he answers, He was once as great and sharp an Adversary to Christ, and all that believed in him, as any man whatsoever; and thought himself bound in Conscience to endeavour the suppression of all those that owned him; which accordingly he did, being a principal Actor in the imprisoning of several of them at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And when some of them were by the <HI>Jews,</HI> tumultuously condemned to die, (as particularly <HI>Steven, Act. ch.</HI> 7.57, 58.), he was an approver of the sentence, <HI>Act.</HI> 8.1. And in other Cities besides <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he brought them into the <HI>Jewish</HI> Courts, and Consistories, (which were kept in their Synagogues), and with threatnings and tortures compelled them to deny Christ, and (being exceedingly fierce against them) he forced some of them to fly to <HI>heathen Cities,</HI> and then pursued them thither also. He further declares, that as he was going to <HI>Damascus,</HI> with authority from the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> on this persecuting design, at mid-day a light from Heaven, above the brightness of the Sun, shone round about him, and those that were with him; and when they were all fallen prostrate on the Earth, he heard a voice speaking to him in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongue; <HI>Saul, Saul, why dost thou thus persecute me? 'Tis hard for thee to kick against the pricks. But arise, stand upon thy feet, for thou art chosen by me to be a Preacher of the Gospel, and to proclaim unto others, what thou hast now, and shalt hereafter see and know. And for thy comfort, be assured, that I will deliver
<PB N="295" REF="155"/> thee from the persecutions both of</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Gentiles▪ <HI>to whom I shall send thee; and will bless thy endeavours to the opening their understandings, and to the turning of them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive, by Faith in me, remission of sins, and a portion of the heavenly in∣heritance, among my faithful ones, regenera∣ted by my Spirit</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Paulus hic non tantum refert quae Christus sibi dixerit in viâ extra urbem cum immediatè ipsum ex coelo alloqueretur; sed etiam quae postea nunciaverit in urbe per ministerium Ananiae.</NOTE>. He further tells the King, that having had so glorious a Vision, and having heard those words from the mouth of Christ, from Heaven, he could not but yeild obedience thereto, and accor∣dingly had preached at <HI>Damascus</HI> first, and then at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and then through all <HI>Judea,</HI> and at last a∣mong the <HI>Gentiles</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">Natio superba Judaeorum ferre non potuit, quod beneficia foederis ad Gentes quoque extenderentur.</NOTE> themselves, the Do∣ctrine of <HI>Repentance,</HI> and had shewed them their misery by sin, and how they should turn to God, and lay hold on his mercy offered in his Son, and should bring forth such fruits of holiness and righteousness in their lives, as are the genuine fruits of true Re∣pentance, and Faith in Christ. And for <HI>these things</HI> (he shews) it was, that he had like to have been killed by the <HI>Jews</HI> in the Temple. But being rescued by the merciful providence of God from their fury, he went on still with his work, de∣claring no other thing concerning Christ, but what <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets did of old foretell of him, namely, that he should be <HI>put to death,</HI> and should be the first that should rise again, by his own power, and thereby be eminently declared to be the Son of God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Rom. 1.1.</NOTE>, and should be the Author of our resurrecti∣on, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.20. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.18. and should send out the light of his Gospel both to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles. Festus</HI> sate still hither∣to, but being a <HI>Heathen,</HI> and not understanding these things, he interrupted the Apostle and told him, he talked like a man that had overstudied himself. But <HI>Paul</HI> with a great respect replied, that he was not <HI>mad,</HI> but spake the <HI>words of truth and soberness;</HI> which he was confident <HI>King Agrippa</HI> very well perceived; for these things he had been speaking of, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Life, Death,</HI> and <HI>Resurrection of Christ,</HI> were things of very pub∣lick fame, and cognizance, and could not be unknown to him who was a <HI>Jew</HI> born. Then humbly applying himself to <HI>Agrippa</HI> again, he said, <HI>King Agrippa, believest thou the Prophets? doubt∣less, I am perswaded thou dost believe them,</HI> and if so, I pray thee consider, whether those very Prophecies be not exactly fulfilled in the Person of Christ? <HI>Agrippa</HI> hearing him thus speak, said, <HI>Paul, thou dost almost perswade me to be a Christian.</HI> The Apo∣stle answered, I heartily wish that both thou, and all here pre∣sent were as thorow Christians as I my self am<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">Non requirit similitudinem se∣cum in officio sed in conversione &amp; pietate. Non requirit aequalitatem in gradibus sed similitudinem in essentia∣libus pietatis.</NOTE>, only I would not wish any of you in that condition of captivity in which I am at present. When he had thus spoken, the King, and the Governour, and the whole
<PB N="296" REF="156"/> company rose up, and departed, acquitting <HI>Paul</HI> in their judg∣ments, from deserving either <HI>death</HI> or <HI>bonds;</HI> yet 'twas not thought fit he should be released, because he had <HI>appealed to Caesar.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Act.</HI> 25. <HI>v.</HI> 13. And after certain days, King Agrippa, and Bernice came unto Cesarea, to salute Festus.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 14. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Pauls cause unto the King, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 15. About whom when I was at Jerusalem, the chief Priests and the Elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 16. To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to de∣liver any man to die, before that he which is accused, have the accu∣sers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crimes laid against him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 17. Therefore when they were come hither, without any delay, on the morrow I sate on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 18. Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none ac∣cusation of such things as I supposed:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 19. But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 20. And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him, whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these mat∣ters.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 21. But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Cesar.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 22. Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man my self. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 23. And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice with great pomp, and was entred into the place of hearing, with the chief Captains, and principal men of the City; at Festus commandment Paul was brought forth.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 24. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here pre∣sent with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying, that he ought not to live any longer.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 25. But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 26. Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my Lord: Where∣fore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O King Agrippa, that after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 27. For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not withall to signifie the crimes laid against him.</P>
<P><HI>Act.</HI> 26. <HI>v.</HI> 1. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thy self. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 2. I think my self happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answer for my self this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accu∣sed of the Jews:</P>
<PB N="297" REF="156"/>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 3. Especially, because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 4. My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own Nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 5. Which knew me from the beginning, (if they would testifie), that after the most straitest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 6. And now I stand, and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 7. Unto which promise our twelve Tribes instantly serving God day and night, hope to come: for which hope sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 8. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 9. I verily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things con∣trary to the Name of Jesus of Nazareth:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 10. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in prison; having received authority from the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 11. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme, and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange Cities.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 12. Whereupon, as I went to Damascus with authority and commissi∣on from the chief priests,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 13. At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them which journeyed with me.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 14. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speak∣ing unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why per∣secutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 15. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 16. But arise, and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness, both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will ap∣pear unto thee.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 17. Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 18. To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 19. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the hea∣venly vision:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 20. But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and Jerusalem, and tho∣rowout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 21. For these causes the Jews caught me in the Temple, and went a∣bout to kill me.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 22. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 23. That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</P>
<P><HI>v</HI> 24. And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thy self, much learning do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h make thee mad.</P>
<PB N="298" REF="157"/>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 25. But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 26. For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am perswaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done in a corner.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 27. King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou be∣lievest.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 28. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou perswadest me to be a Christian.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 29. And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bonds.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 30. And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the gover∣nour, and Bernice, and they that sate with them.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 31. And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</P>

Aristarchus</HI> a <HI>Macedo∣nian,</HI> as also <HI>Luke</HI> and <HI>Timothy</HI> freely accompanied the Apostle in this Voyage. As they sailed along, they touched at <HI>Sidon,</HI> where <HI>Julius</HI> was very civil to <HI>Paul,</HI> and permitted him to go on shore, and visit his friends there, and refresh himself. Loosing from thence, they were forced to sail under <HI>Cyprus,</HI> because the winds were contrary; and when they had coasted by <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and <HI>Pamphylia,</HI> they came to <HI>Myra,</HI> a City of <HI>Lysia,</HI> where this Ship finished its Voyage. Thence in a Ship of <HI>Alexandria</HI> bound for <HI>Italy,</HI> they passed between those <HI>Promontories</HI> of <HI>Gnidus,</HI> and <HI>Salmone,</HI> and came at last, with some difficulty, to a part of <HI>Crete,</HI> call'd the <HI>Fair Havens.</HI> This Port being some∣thing incommodious to winter in, most of the passengers ad∣vise to put out from thence, and to endeavour to gain <HI>Phoe∣nice,</HI> another Haven of <HI>Crete;</HI> but they having been thus long at Sea, (the Summer being now gone, yea the <HI>great Fast</HI> of expiation, which was on the tenth day of the seventh Month, being past, after which the Sea was not sailed in by the An∣cients

Therefore he advised them, to stay and winter where they now were. But his words prevailed nothing, because the <HI>Master</HI> of the ship (who was thought better skill'd in his own Art) advised otherwise.

However he bids them be of good chear; for no man among them should perish, only the Ship would be lost.

<P>They having therefore for fourteen days together been thus toss'd in the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, (not strictly so call'd, but in a large sense), at last the Mariners thought they drew near some Coun∣try, and by letting down their plummet, and sounding, they found it at first twenty fathoms, and trying again, they found it fifteen fathoms, which was an argument to them they were near a shore. But it being night, and they apprehending dan∣ger,

In the morning they discovered Land, but knew not where they were. However they discovered a cer∣tain Creek, into which they resolved, if it were possible, to run the Ship.

But falling into a place where two Seas met, they ran the Ship a-ground, so that the <HI>fore part</HI> sticking fast, the <HI>hinder-part</HI> was broken with the violence of the waves; nothing now remain∣ing, but that every one should shift for his life, and swim to shore, if he could, the Soldiers (shewing a cruel ingratitude to

<P>IN this <HI>Island</HI> they were very courteously received by the <HI>Islanders,</HI> who made a great fire for them to warm and re∣fresh them, coming wet, and cold out of the sea. <HI>Paul</HI> having gathered a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a <HI>Vi∣per</HI> that was in the wood, feeling the heat of the fire, leaped out upon him, and fastned on his hand; which the <HI>Islanders</HI> seeing, they presently concluded that he was certainly some notorious Malefactor, whom divine vengeance followed, though he had now escaped at sea.

Hereupon a day being appointed for that purpose, many of the <HI>Jews</HI> came to his lodging, to whom he opened at large these <HI>two points,</HI> 1. <HI>That the Kingdom of the Messiah promised by God to the Fathers was to be a spiritual, not an earthly Kingdom.</HI> 2. <HI>That Jesus of Nazareth was the true Messiah, in whom all that desire to be saved, ought to trust and believe.</HI> Both these he confirmed by testimonies, out of the <HI>Law of Moses,</HI> and out of the <HI>Prophets;</HI> con∣tinuing his discourse from morning till night.<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">Est primum signum &amp; pars es∣sentialis Orthodoxae Ecclesiae, &amp; do∣ctrinae, Scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uram habere pro unicâ regulâ doctrinae, cujus judicio standum, &amp; cadendum: &amp;, qui ab hac regulâ, ab hoc judice recedit, ad aliud tribunal provoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, &amp; in alia authoritate suam fidem fundat, is ab orthodoxâ Eccle∣sia discessisse ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icandus, &amp; pro <HI>haereti∣co</HI> habendus, non <HI>Catholico.

<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istle of Iames.</NOTE><HI>1. COncerning the right bearing of afflictions, or outward temptations;</HI> He tells them, they are to account it matter of great and solid joy, when they meet with divers troubles and afflictions for the profession of the Gos∣pel; by which afflictions, they may be proved, whether they will, even in adver∣sity, stick close to Christ, or no. For they should consider, that those temptati∣ons are <HI>trials</HI> of their Faith; and the trial of their Faith worketh patience, through the operation of the Spirit of God. And they should learn to be pati∣ent to the end, <HI>(Mat. 10.22.),</HI> that so nothing may be wanting to them, for the perfecting and making up all the parts of holiness in them And because 'tis a hard matter to bear afflictions aright, and a great deal of heavenly wisdom is requisite thereunto, he advises, that when any of them, in such times of pres∣sure as those were, do find themselves to want this wisdom and skill to manage themselves aright, that then they should humbly beg it of God, who giveth libe∣rally, and upbraideth not. But then (he tells them) they must ask in <HI>Faith,</HI> and with a fixed dependance on God, not wavering, or doubting either concerning his power, goodness, or faithfulness. For <HI>doubting</HI> or <HI>wavering</HI> keeps men in a perpetual disquiet, and agitation of mind, not knowing what to depend on. Besid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, this is the way to have their <HI>prayers</HI> blasted, God not being wont to hear <HI>them,</HI> that do not sincerely depend on him. And he further tells them, that 'tis not only in prayer, that this fluctuation, or wavering of spirit, pro∣duces such ill effects; but he shews them, that such a person hath the infelicity of never knowing in other occasions, where to fix or what course to take. And having given them this caution concerning <HI>prayer,</HI> he returns to his purpose a∣gain, of comforting the afflicted under their trials. And in order hereunto, he counsels the <HI>poor Christian,</HI> who is through afflictions or the Cross, humbled by the Lord, and brought low, to comfort himself, yea to glory in <HI>this,</HI> that he is exalted to the high dignity of being an adopted Child of God. And the <HI>rich man</HI> he counsels, not to rejoice in his <HI>riches;</HI> but if God have given him an humble frame of mind, and a preparedness to bear the Cross, and to be brought low, to <HI>rejoice</HI> in that frame of spirit. For all his glory (as he is a rich man) is very fading. As the Sun when it is risen scorcheth the green grass, and maketh the florid part of it presently to wither; so a <HI>rich man</HI> (when God permits it) soon fadeth in his estate, and cometh to nothing, notwithstanding all his counsels and endeavours to the contrary. He concludes this admonition, declaring <HI>that Christian to be blessed,</HI> who patiently endureth the afflictions which he shall meet with in the way of his duty; for when he shall be tryed, and found faithful, he shall at length obtain the crown of eternal life, which the Lord hath graciously promised to them that love him, and that testifie their love to him, by a patient enduring tribulations for his sake. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 13.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Having thus spoken of <HI>outward</HI> temptations, (or afflictions), he comes now, to speak of <HI>inward,</HI> namely, such as sollicite to sin, and which consist in evil inclinations. And he advises them, to take heed of that Blasphemy that casts the blame of these temptations upon God. For God is of so <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>ho∣ly</HI> a nature that he cannot be tempted or stirred up to sin by any means what∣ever; neither doth he sollicite or stir up any one to it. But a man is tempted, or stirred up to evil, by the <HI>inward lust,</HI> or <HI>original corruption</HI> of his own heart; the gradual motions whereof are these. <HI>1.</HI> By the instigation of this in∣ward lust, or concupiscence, a man is drawn aside from true good, and allur'd to evil. <HI>2.</HI> This inward lust solliciting, and enticing, gets at length the consent of the will, and so is said to conceive. <HI>3.</HI> Then a man actually sins, and so sin
<PB N="311" REF="163"/> brings forth. <HI>4.</HI> Sin being committed, by its desert bringeth forth or procureth death. Therefore they should take heed of permitting themselves so far to be de∣ceived, as to ascribe the cause of their impiety unto God. For He is <HI>immu∣tably</HI> the Author of all good, and from him d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scends every good gift. God is the Father of lights, and spiritual illumination, and (says he), of his own free mercy and good will, he hath <HI>regenerated</HI> and converted <HI>us</HI> (who are be∣lievers among the <HI>Jews</HI>) by the word of his Gospel, that as the first fruits<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> dicuntur qui ante alios vo∣cati sunt, 1 Cor. 16.15.</NOTE> were under the Law consecrated to God, so we might be consecrated to him be∣fore any other people, and so he hath allowed us the favour of being the first that have been called to this dignity, <HI>[see Eph. 1.12.],</HI> therefore we ought to be far from admitting any such blasphemous thought concerning God, as if we were moved at any time by him to sin or evil. <HI>From Ver. 13, to 19.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> Having mentioned their <HI>regeneration</HI> by the preaching of the Gospel, he takes occasion to shew them, how the <HI>Word</HI> ought to be <HI>heard</HI> and <HI>received.</HI> In particular, that they should be <HI>swift</HI> and ready to hear it, but slow to speak or cavil against it, and slow to wrath, not being soon offended, and angry at the convictions or reproofs of it. For mans sinful anger doth not put men upon do∣ing those things, that are just and righteous in Gods account. And because wrath is such a hindrance to the righteousness which God requireth, he adviseth, that all filthy, and evil speaking, and overflowing of malice, all scoffs, and railing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be laid aside, and that with meekness they should receive the word, which God by his Spirit does, as it were, graff and implant in the soul, that it may bring forth fruits acceptable unto Him, and which being accompanied by his di∣vine grace, is his power unto salvation. He further shews, how they should not only be <HI>hearers</HI> of the Word, but <HI>doers</HI> of it. And he declares the vanity and unprofitableness of bare hearing, by a similitude taken from a man looking his face in a Glass, who soon forgetteth the fashion of his own countenance, ha∣ving only a slight view thereof: So the preaching of the Word usually maketh but slight impressions on careless hearers. But they that look narrowly, and di∣ligently inquire into the whole Doctrine of the Gospel, (which is a <HI>perfect Law,</HI> teaching the way to true liberty, and freedom from <HI>sin, wrath,</HI> and <HI>e∣ternal death,</HI> and brings us into a free state, a state of Sonship) and abide, and remain in the knowledg and belief thereof, and obedience thereto, not being forgetful hearers, but mindful of the duties, and work<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Faith</HI> is our work, <HI>Repentance</HI> our business, the <HI>life</HI> of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>praise</HI> our duty. Dr. <HI>Manton</HI> in loc.</NOTE> the Gospel prescribes, such persons shall be blessed in this course. And l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st any should challenge a share in this blessedness to whom it does not belong, he shews, who are <HI>hearers only,</HI> and <HI>not doers</HI> of the Word, namely, such as allow them∣selves in any known sin, and particularly in the sins of the tongue. For he tells them, that <HI>that man</HI> miserably deceives his own heart, who thinketh himself truly religious, yet bridleth not his tongue<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Audi multa, loquer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> opportuna.</NOTE>. Such a mans profession of the Christian Faith, he assures them, is but vain. But they that would manifest their pro∣fession to be sincere, and immaculate, and such as God (who is the Father of Christ, and of all true Believers in him) approveth, must manifest it by works of <HI>Charity,</HI> and <HI>Purity,</HI> keeping themselves from the wickedness and defile∣ments that prevail in the World, wherewith so many are polluted. <HI>From Ver. 19, to the end.</HI></P>

And that he might further shew them their practice herein, not only to be vain and evil, but sensless and irrational, he useth a new Argument to this purpose. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not rich men</HI> (says he) <HI>oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</HI> It seems, many of the rich men among whom they lived were bitter enemies, and reproachers of Christianity; and therefore he in∣timates, that <HI>wealth</HI> was not to be such a motive to them to favour the cause of the rich, when it came to be tried before them. Indeed, if they did dispense their respects aright, giving the rich men only, what is just, and meet, and did not deprive their poorer Brethren, of what is due to <HI>them,</HI> and in all things carried themselves according to that <HI>Royal Law</HI> of the <HI>King of kings,</HI> con∣tained in the Scripture, (which enjoins us <HI>to love our Neighbour as our selves,</HI> and <HI>to do to others what we would judg fit to be done to us</HI>), then they did well; but this partial respecting of the rich, with contempt of the poor, plainly shewed them to be transgressors, and not fulfillers of this Law. For the <HI>Law, Lev. 19.15.</HI> (to which place 'tis probable he pointeth), saith, <HI>Thou shalt do no unrighteousness in judgment: Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor the person of the mighty; but in righteous∣ness shalt thou judg thy neighbour.</HI> But here they might object <HI>this,</HI> that which he reprov'd in them was a <HI>small offence,</HI> and might be easily excus'd, and their obedience in other things might make amends for such a small failing as this was. To this he answers, that, Suppose a man should be an exact ob∣server of all other points of the Law (which yet is impossible) and willingly offend in one particular, he is guilty of breaking the whole Law. Not that <HI>all sins</HI> concurr in <HI>one,</HI> but because a contempt of the same Law and Law-giver is manifested in the breach of one Command as well as of all. For obedi∣ence to Gods will is required <HI>universally</HI> to all that he commands, and he that offends in one command, though he keep all the rest, fails of the obedience which is due from him, and so is punishable as well as if he had offended in all. And that he may make this matter the more clear, he instances in the <HI>Sixth</HI> and <HI>Se∣venth Commandments,</HI> shewing that in the violation of either, the authority of the <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> and of him that commanded <HI>both,</HI> is violated. But they might again object, that they shall not ultimately be judged by the Law, as gi∣ven by <HI>Moses,</HI> (which requires perfect obedience in every respect, and pronounces a Curse upon every one that in the least transgresseth), but by the Gospel, <HI>[see ch. 1.25.].</HI> He answers, that he would have them so <HI>speak,</HI> and <HI>act,</HI> and carry themselves in those matters, as those that shall be judged by the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which is a Law of <HI>Liberty</HI> indeed, but not of <HI>licentiousness;</HI> of liberty from sin, but not of liberty to sin. And if they would not come under the rigour of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> they must not be cruel and injurious to their poor Brethren. For the equity of that Law requireth, that those persons should find no mercy, who will
<PB N="313" REF="164"/> shew none. Therefore mercy is not to be hoped for, by those that only honour rich men, but by those that are full of Bow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, and bounty to the poor. For as the mercy of God rejoiceth over his justice; so mercy exercis'd by man, gives him occasion to hope, yea to rejoice in the mercy of God, and exceedingly supports him against the fear of his justice and judgment. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 14.</HI></P>

So that in this whole dis∣course, the Apostles intent and drift is, to shew, not <HI>what justifieth,</HI> but <HI>who</HI> is justified; not what Faith <HI>doth,</HI> but what Faith <HI>is.</HI> He that hath a <HI>true Faith,</HI> is sure of Salvation; but not always he that saith he hath Faith. His drift therefore is, not to shew, that <HI>Faith without works doth not justifie,</HI> but that a bare Assent to the truths of the Gospel, which is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t accompanied with good works, is not <HI>Faith;</HI> and the <HI>Justification</HI> he here speaketh of, is not so much of the <HI>Person,</HI> as of the <HI>Faith.</HI> For as professions of love to those that are indigent, and in want, without performance, are vain; so such a <HI>Faith,</HI> which is but a naked assent to the Gospel, or a bare profession of it, without producing good fruits, is unprofitable and dead. He further urgeth his present Argument, by framing a <HI>Dialogue,</HI> between a <HI>true Believer,</HI> that can manifest his Faith by his works, and a <HI>boasting Hyprocrite,</HI> that can produce no works to evidence or demonstrate the truth of his Faith. The <HI>true Believer</HI> may say to such a person thus; <HI>Thou boastest with thy tongue, and saist, thou hast Faith. I shall not boast, but humbly produce the real testimony of my works,</HI> (see Mat. <HI>11.4, 5.), as an evidence of my Faith. Thy Faith is not productive of good works. Now shew me thy Faith without works, and make it appear to me by any Scripture-ground, (if thou canst), to be a sincere and true Faith; and if thou canst not, I will shew thee my Faith, accompanied with good works, and demon∣strate it to be sincere by my works, seeing they are a real evidence and proof of it. But thou wilt say, thou hast a true Faith, for thou belie∣vest there is one God. Thou dost well in so believing; yet if this Faith of thine consist in a bare knowledg, or ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of thy mind, and do not produce in thee a real love to God, and affiance in him, and a serious endeavour to please him, what advantage hast thou thereby above the Devils? For they believe this truth as well as thou, but are far enough from having any true Faith; for instead of conceiving any hope there∣by of salvation, they are fill'd with unceivable horror, upon the appre∣hension of his justice. All knowledg of God, out of Christ, is very un∣comfortable to sinners. But wilt thou rightly understand and consider, (O vain Professor</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">The Apostle doth not direct this to any one person, but to such an order or sort of men. Hypocrites must be roused with some asperity &amp; sharpness.</NOTE>!), <HI>what may be said against thy Faith, and to prove to thee, that Faith without works is dead? seeing good works are a proper and insep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable effect of true and saving Faith? I say, they are such effects, as do not give life to it, but declare it, and manifest it, as Apples do not give life to the tree, but shew and demonstrate life to be in it. I shall further prove this point to thee, by the examples of persons justified of old, and shall shew, that they were not justified by a dead and fruitless Faith, but by a Faith bringing forth good works. And I shall instance only in two,</HI> Abraham <HI>and</HI> R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hab. <HI>As for</HI> Abraham, <HI>I demand, whether he were not justified by works, (particularly, that eminent work, when he really

The <HI>one</HI> taketh justificati∣on for acquittance from sin, and the <HI>other</HI> for acquittance from hypocrisie.

Paul</HI> having to do with <HI>Pharisaical Justicia∣ries</HI> proveth invincibly, <HI>Justification by Faith,</HI> without works. <HI>James</HI> having to deal with <HI>carnal Professors,</HI> proveth as strongly, That a Profession of Faith, without Works, is dead.</NOTE>? <HI>Thou seest therefore, that his Faith rested not in a bare knowledg, or profession, but was operative; it had efficacy and influence upon his works; it did not exert it self in acts of belie∣ving only, but also in working; so that his Faith, by producing good works, was declared to be a perfect and true Faith, and such as had all the parts belonging to it. And his Faith was impro∣ved, and strengthened, and perfected by works, as the inward vigour of the spirits is increas'd by motion and exercise. Yet this must not be so understood, as if works did</HI> perfect Faith, <HI>by com∣municating of perfection to it, but only that they do stir up, exercise, and excite the vigour of it. This therefore being an evident discovery of</HI> A∣brahams <HI>Faith; it plainly appear'd, how truly it was said of him before,</HI> Gen. <HI>15.</HI> that he believed, and it was imputed to him for righteousness. <HI>So that the first testimony, and solemn approbation which</HI> Abraham <HI>had from God, was because of his Faith. And by his readiness to sacrifice his Son, he de∣clared he had a true justifying-Faith; and accor∣dingly</HI> the Lord <HI>saith after this trial, Now I know that thou fearest me,</HI> Gen. <HI>22.12. And hereupon he was called,</HI> the Friend <HI>of God. You see then, that by</HI> Works <HI>(that is; by the parts, and offices of a holy life) a man is</HI> justified, <HI>that is,</HI> acquitted from hypocrisie, <HI>and his</HI> Faith <HI>is manifested to be</HI> good, and right, and <HI>he himself</HI> just <HI>and</HI> righteous. <HI>You see also, that he is not justified by Faith on∣ly,</HI> that is, <HI>by a bare, and naked profession, or dead and vain Faith, such as consisteth in a meer assent, or empty knowledg and speculation, which is so far from justifying, that it is not properly</HI> Faith. <HI>I come now to my other</HI> instance, viz. <HI>that of</HI> Rahab, <HI>which I the rather make use of, because some might say, that indeed</HI> Abrahams Faith <HI>(the great pat∣tern of Believers) might produce good works, but every Believers</HI> Faith <HI>cannot arise to the strength of</HI> Abrahams. <HI>For answer to this, I shall shew, that the weakest Faith, that is</HI> true, and saving <HI>must produce good works. And for the proof of this, I shall instance in</HI> Rahab <HI>an</HI> Harlot<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> meretrix] Videtur vox etiam <HI>cauponam</HI> significare: plerunque <HI>cauponae</HI> talem etiam quaestum laciebant.

<PB N="315" REF="165"/>
<P>He concludeth this whole dispute, shewing, how little is to be ascribed to an <HI>empty profession of Faith</HI> without works: such a Faith, he tells them, 'tis but as the body without the vital spirit, which every body knows to be no more than a meer carcass. <HI>From Ver. 14, to the end.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> He re-assumes the discourse he had been upon before in the end of the first Chapter, admonishing them to take heed of <HI>offending with their tongues,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 3.</NOTE> and particularly, not to arrogate to themselves a <HI>supercilious Mastership</HI> over others, (taking upon them to censure them at pleasure), because <HI>such heavy censures</HI> draw down upon themselves very great and heavy judgments; <HI>see 1 Cor. 11.31.

But great inconveniences a∣rise where this <HI>small member</HI> is not well-governed. For as a little fire kindleth much wood, so an evil Tongue is a fire, (there is a world<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mundus iniquitatis,</HI> id est, res plenissima iniquitatis.</NOTE> of sin in it), 'tis a powerful means to kindle great strifes and divi∣sions. An <HI>evil Tongue</HI> is of so cursed an influence, that it often defiles the whole body, <HI>that is,</HI> involves the other members in guilt, and defiles them, by drawing them to act, and commit sin, <HI>[see Eccles. 5.6.].</HI> It sets on fire the whole World<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quidam <HI>circulum</HI> seu <HI>orbem condi∣tum,</HI> (ut sit <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp; <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> pro <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), <HI>redduni,</HI> ut significetur, linguam perversam totum orbem mundi, velut <HI>infernali igne</HI> in∣flammare. <HI>Glass.</HI></NOTE>, or, (as some render it), the whole course and revolution of our life<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Accendi à linguâ rotam nativita∣tis nostrae]</HI> Humanae vitae cursum rotae comparat.

The evils of the tongue diffuse themselves into all the parts of mans life, and it sets on fire, with its wickedness, the wheel and course of all our natural faculties, being it self set on fire by the Devil, and kindled with that fire that comes from Hell. And having thus shewed the cursed influence of the Tongue, he comes now to shew, how difficult the cure is. He tells them, there are no kind of Beasts but may be tam'd by humane art and skill; nothing in nature so violent and hurtful, but humane art and industry, hath made it serviceable to the use of men. But the Tongue is harder to be tam'd than any of these. 'Tis such an <HI>indisciplinable member,</HI> that no mans reason, or skill, can tame another<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">v. 8. Linguam; nempe alienam, nemo domare potest, sicut animalia sera mansuefacimus. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> mans unruly tongue; nor can he tame <HI>his own</HI> of himself, without the assistance of divine grace. An evil Tongue is an unrestrainable evil, full of deadly poison, spitting forth the venome of re∣viling, backbiting, reproaching, cursing, and many other evils.</P>
<P>But some might here object, <HI>With our tongues we praise God,</HI> therefore the Tongue is not so full of venome as you suggest.</P>
<P>For answer, he shews, What a foul sin it is in any Christian to use this member to so distant offices as some do, namely, therewith in the publick con∣gregation to bless God, and afterwards to judg and rail at their Christian Bre∣thren, who, for that Image of God they bear upon them, are to be regarded,
<PB N="316" REF="166"/> and used with kindness: What, says he, shall two such contrary things, as <HI>blessing</HI> and <HI>cursing,</HI> proceed out of the same mouth? This, he tells them, ought not to be. And if they would further understand the monstrousness of this practice, he will represent it unto them, by three Similitudes. Can a <HI>fountain</HI> (says he) send forth two sorts of waters, of so different a nature, as <HI>bitter</HI> and <HI>sweet?</HI> or can the <HI>Sea</HI> send out <HI>salt</HI> water and <HI>fresh?</HI> Can a <HI>Fig-tree</HI> bear <HI>Figs</HI> and <HI>Olive-berries</HI> too?

And as these things are impossible in the ordinary course of Nature; so he shews them, 'tis absurd in manners, that the <HI>same Tongue</HI> should bring forth <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil,</HI> should <HI>bless</HI> and <HI>curse, pray</HI> and <HI>revile.</HI> Therefore the tongue should be employed to those good uses to which God has appointed it, and not to the contrary. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 13.</HI></P>

<P>The occasion of the Epistle was this. <HI>Philemon,</HI> one of the <HI>Colossian</HI> Pastors, had a Servant, (<HI>Onesimus</HI> by name), who not abiding his Masters service any longer, watched his time, and ran away; and as it seems, did not run away empty, but also purloined something.

Among other Fish, that <HI>that great Fisher of men</HI> caught, with the spreading <HI>Net</HI> of the Gospel, this poor <HI>fugitive</HI> was one; who being converted, and brought to a sa∣ving-knowledg of Christ, he for some time ministred to <HI>Paul</HI> in Prison. But the Apostle, because he was another mans servant, (and particularly, his dear friend <HI>Philemon</HI>'s), and of right belonged to him, being his <HI>lawful possession,</HI> and as it were <HI>his mony,</HI> (as the Law speaks, <HI>Exod.</HI> 21.21.), he would not de∣tain him from him, without his free consent. He therefore sends him back to his Master, earnestly desiring him to pardon him, and to receive him into favour again. And because the Holy Ghost in this matter gives a remarkable instance of Gods <HI>free-grace to sinners;</HI> and intimates our duty towards those that are <HI>penitent,</HI> therefore, for the perpetual edification of the Church, he would have this be received among the other Ca∣nonical Epistles.</P>

<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> He removes the scandal they might take at his present sufferings, which he shews, tended rather to the furtherance than the hinderance of the Gospel.</P>
<P>For first, his bonds for Christ were famous in <HI>Nero</HI>'s Court, and several o∣ther places <HI>in</HI> and <HI>near Rome,</HI> and people inquiring into the cause of his suf∣ferings did learn somewhat of Christ and the Gospel by that means.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Many of the Brethren in the Ministry of Christ, having heard of his constancy under his sufferings, were encouraged to shake off all fear, and to preach Christ more boldly than ever.

For the case stood thus with him, If he <HI>lived,</HI> Christ should be the <HI>scope</HI> of his life, and he intended to live to his service; if

<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> He exhorts them, that whatever should befall him, they would mind their duty, and behave themselves as becometh the Gospel, ordering their conversation according to the Precepts of Christ, and jointly contending the best they can, with p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct unity, and joint stedfastness of mind, to maintain and defend the Faith of Christ, which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be matter of great joy to him, whether he came and saw it, (as he hop'd he should), or only heard of it, being absent. And what∣ever opposition or persecutions they met with in this course, he bids them not suffer themselves to be discourag'd or affrighted at them, seeing they were great signs that their adversaries (who brought them upon them) were in the way of perditi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and that they who suffered such things patiently for Christs sake, and the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel, were in the way of salvation; they portended destruction to their adversaries, but through Gods gracious disposing, they should promote their sal∣vation.</P>
<P>And this should further encourage them, that as <HI>grace to believe in Christ,</HI> so also <HI>grace to suffer couragiously for him</HI> and <HI>his truth,</HI> was a part of Christs purchase for them, and for his sake given unto them: And hereby they had communion and co-partnership with him (their Apostle) in afflictions, who suffered many hard things at <HI>Philippi,</HI> and elsewhere, as they themselves had seen, and at this present suffered bonds at <HI>Rome. From Ver. 27, to the end.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Chap."/> <HI>5.</HI> He comes now to exhort these <HI>Philippians</HI> to <HI>unity</HI> and <HI>concord</HI> among themselves; and that he might more effectually perswade them thereunto, he con∣jures them that if ever th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y had found any consolation in Christ, if any com∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of mutual love, if any fellowship with God by the communication of the graces of his Spirit, if they had any pity or compassion on him, a Prisoner for Christ; He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntreats and obtests them by all these, and as they would give proof of all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, that to all the other matter of rejoicing which he had concerning th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, they would add this also, (and so make his joy complete), namely, to live in unity among themselves, having as it were the same mind and judgment, the same will and affections, and minding and carrying on the same designs. He exh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts them, not to do any thing out of opposition or contention one against ano∣ther, nor out of vain glory or ambition; but to carry themselves with all humility and lowliness of mind, as if they had every one a better opinion of anothers wisdom, and goodness than of his own; and to this end they should not look so intently on those gifts and abilities which they discern in themselves, but withall, and much rather, should consider the gifts and abilities of others more eminent than themselves. And if they would but esteem others <HI>more,</HI> and themselves <HI>less;</HI> this would tend to frame their minds to humility. And that he might press them effectually to the practice of this virtue, he sets before them thē example
<PB N="327" REF="171"/> of Christ, who being from all eternity <HI>true God,</HI> and being in the <HI>form,</HI> that is, having the <HI>form</HI> or <HI>essence</HI> of God, and the natural properties of the Dei∣ty, so that he thought it no encroachment or usurpation to reckon himself in equa∣lity with his Father, (the same glory and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesty justly belonging to him), yet did He empty himself of that divine glory, which befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e he had, not by cea∣sing to be what he <HI>was,</HI> but by assuming som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thing to himself which before he had not, to wit, the humane Nature.

And therefore on this account he emptied hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf, and divested himself of the Robes of his Majesty, and from being Lord of all, he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssened and humbled himself to the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nditi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of an ordinary man, yea of a <HI>servant;</HI> and He was made in the <HI>likeness</HI> of men, that is, like to one of us in the <HI>essential</HI> parts of humane Nature, to wit, of Soul and Body; and was found in fashion as a man, the truth and reality of his humane Nature being evidently known unto those who did converse with him, by the fashion and proportion of his body, and the whole strain of his carriage and actions.

He sent him also the more readily, that his own trouble might be somewhat removed, which accrued to him on consideration, that their Minister, (whose company they so much desired) had been so long detained from them on his account. He exhorts them therefore to receive him with such an affection as they ought to express towards the faithful Servants of the Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">v. 29. <HI>In Domino]</HI> i. e.

He was circumcised the eighth day after his birth, as <HI>Isaac</HI> and his posterity were. He was of the Stock of <HI>Israel,</HI> and so no Proselyte, or Convert from among the <HI>Gen∣tiles.</HI> He was of the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and so came of that Tribe which with the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> clave to the house of <HI>David,</HI> and the true worship of God at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> after the revolt of the Ten Tribes; and if he had a mind to speak of the ancientness and nobility of his Stock; he might say, he was a <HI>Hebrew</HI> of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> descended by both his Parents of <HI>Abrahams</HI> Race, (called the <HI>He∣brew, Gen. 14.13</HI>), and from <HI>Eb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> of whom the <HI>Jews</HI> were called <HI>Ebrews,</HI> who lived before the confusion of Tongues at <HI>Babel, Gen. 14 13, 20, 21, 25.</HI> And he was not an ordinary <HI>Ebrew</HI> or <HI>Jew</HI> neither, but of the strictest Sect a∣mong them, even a <HI>Pharisee,</HI> which Sect were for a severer interpretation, and stricter observation of the Law than the rest of the <HI>Jews, Act. 26.5.</HI> And as a signal Testimony of his great zeal to the <HI>Law,</HI> and the <HI>Jewish Religion,</HI> he had been a violent Persecutor of the Christian Church, whom he look'd upon as enemies thereto. And lastly, As to his personal obedience and observance of the Law, he was able to say as much as another, his Conversation having been so blameless be∣fore men, that it could not be justly taxed by them. But however when he was in his unconverted state, he had relyed on these things for Salvation, and count∣ed them great advantages in order thereunto, yet now being savingly enlightned, he saw that nothing could redound to him by trusting in them, but real hurt and damage, and therefore he had taken his confidence off from them, and wholly pla∣ced it on Christ; yea he did not only esteem them so when he was first con∣verted, but did so still. For he could not but account all such things by which men seek salvation out of Christ, <HI>detrimental</HI> and <HI>hurtful,</HI> so far as they keep them from closing with him. He could not but account them l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, not only be∣cause they can not effect <HI>that,</HI> for which men do rely upon them; but because their high esteem of them, and confidence in them, hinders them from embracing Christ. He tells them, therefore that he undervalued and disesteem'd them all, in com∣parison of that excellent knowledg of Christ, which draws the heart effectually to close with him, and by a lively Faith and affiance to rely on him, and to take him for its Lord and Saviour. And for this blessed Saviours sake, he tells them,
<PB N="330" REF="173"/> it was, that he had forsak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Friends, Countrey,</HI> and all things that could be dear to him in this World, when he first betook himself to the preaching of the Gospel, and still counted them as <HI>dung,</HI> in comparison of gaining the favour of Christ, and of being found at the day of Judgment ingrafted into him by Faith, and a real member of him, and one that did n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t rely on his <HI>own righteousness,</HI> (such as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n endeavour to acquire by the observation of the Commandments of the Law), but on <HI>that righteousness</HI> which men are made partakers of <HI>by Faith,</HI> when they believe in Christ, and which results from his <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pas∣sive</HI> obedience, and which God freely and graciously imputes to all true Believers for their Justification. And he intimates, how easily he could bear those fore∣mentioned l sses for an <HI>experimental knowledg</HI> and <HI>sense</HI> of Christs grace work∣ing in him; particularly, that he might feel in himself, that <HI>power</HI> whereby Christ was raised from death to life; raising him daily more and more to newness of life, and that he might taste the comfort that ariseth from fellowship with him in his sufferings, suffering for him and with him in his mystical Body, <HI>(Col. 1 24.),</HI> being made thereby conformable to his death, by mortifying inward corruptions, and bearing the Cross for him. And he tells them, he shall not grudg at that, if he may by any means (though with some difficulty), attain un∣to the <HI>resurrection of the dead</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">a Metony∣my of the Subject for the Adjunct.</NOTE>, that is, unto that perfection of holiness, which accompanies and attends the <HI>resurrection of the just, 1 Thes. 4.14.</HI> He acknowledges he had not as yet attained to that degree of holiness, nor look'd upon himself as already perfect, or as one that had already won the prize and rich reward, which is given at the end of the race. But he was in his Christian race, and pursued after that prize with great desire and diligence, and hop'd as∣suredly to obtain it, not by his own strength, but by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assistance of Christ, who for that end laid hold on him, (as he was in the way going to <HI>Damascus</HI> to per∣secute the Christians), and effectually call'd and converted him, and brought him into the way of Salvation. He says again, that he dare not affirm, that he had attained to the state of perfection, but he was as the <HI>Racer</HI> running his race, not casting his eye back, or being satisfied with what he had done, or with so much of the way as he had overcome, but stretching as hard as he could to get the goal, or end of the race, that so he may obtain the prize, <HI>viz.</HI> the prize of eternal Glo∣ry, which shall be given to them to whom God vouchsafes that high favour effe∣ctually to call them to a participation of the merits and righteousness of his Son Jesus Christ. <HI>From Ver. 4; to 15.</HI></P>

Yet he would not have them think, that he rejoiced so much in their bounty towards him, because he could not bear want, or a straight condition.

And this he testified unto them, to prevent their seducement by false <HI>Teachers,</HI> who by false arguments, and ensnaring perswasions sought to beguile them. And he was the more sollicitous concerning them, because though he was absent from them in the body, yet he was present with them <HI>in Spirit,</HI> that is, not in bare con∣ceit or phantasie or affection only, but <HI>so</HI> as he was well acquainted with their state, and had knowledg of their affairs (either through the information of <HI>Epa∣phras,</HI> or through extraordinary revelation, <HI>see 2 King. 5.26.</HI>), and rejoiced exceedingly to see and behold, in the apprehension and vision of his mind, the good order and government of their Church, and the stedfastness of their Faith in Christ, which he would gladly have them continue in.

<P>The Apostle answers, that they, being <HI>Believers,</HI> and united to Christ, need not be <HI>outwardly Circumcised;</HI> for they had <HI>by him,</HI> the thing signified by Circumcision, namely, the <HI>spiritual Circumcision of the heart,</HI> which consists in cutting off, and putting away the body of manifold sins, form'd, and compacted of our innate corruption, whereof particular sins are the members. And the means of this their renovation is <HI>Baptism,</HI> (which succeeds in the place of Circumci∣sion), and which (as it was anciently administred to adult and grown persons) was a clear representation of the <HI>death, burial,</HI> and <HI>resurrection</HI> of Christ, and by proportion represented also how Christians ought to dye unto sin, and rise unto newness of life. Which <HI>new life</HI> they live by <HI>Faith in Christ,</HI> and <HI>that Faith,</HI> God who raised Jesus Christ from the dead, works in them by his own
<PB N="338" REF="177"/> Spirit. He uses also another Argument against the necessity of Circumcision, namely, that when they, in the time of their natural state and condition, were dead in sins, and without Circumcision in their Flesh, (as being <HI>Gentiles, Eph. 2.11.</HI>), God had quickned them, as he did Christ, infusing into them the new life of grace, and giving them a right to the life of Glory, having pardoned all their sins, both <HI>original</HI> and <HI>actual,</HI> freely for his sake, upon their belie∣ving in him. Yea Christ hath by his death, blotted out, and abolished the <HI>hand∣writing of the Ordinances,</HI> and those Legal Ceremonial Injunctions, touching Circumcision, and the observation of <HI>Days,</HI> and several <HI>Washings,</HI> and <HI>Sacri∣fices, Eph. 2.15.</HI> in the observance of which, the <HI>Jews</HI> testified against them∣selves, their own guiltiness and liableness to punishment. For, by killing a Beast they testified they deserved to dye themselves. But now Christ, having by his death satisfied the Justice of God for our sins, hath thereby can∣cell'd those Ordinances<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Chirographum <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> pro <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> quod in decretis positum erat. Nonnulli re∣ferunt ad praescripta Judaica (quo∣rum caput erat <HI>Circumcisio</HI>) seu ad Legales Ceremonias, cum continua illarum repetitio nihil aliud fuerit, quam perpetua peccatorum confessio, Heb. 10.1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> which testified our guiltiness, and bound us over, and declar'd us liable to wrath and vengeance. Now seeing the debt is paid, and the obliga∣tion to wrath which we were under, (by reason of our sins), cancell'd, to revoke this hand-writing of ordinances, (which testified so much against us), and to seek to bring it in force again, as <HI>false Teachers</HI> labour'd to do, (by urging Circumcision, and the Legal Observances), must needs be, not only a great folly, but very pernicious. Nay further, Christ by his death hath not only cancell'd this hand-writing that was against us, and taken it out of the way, and nailed to his Cross, but thereby also hath vanquisht, and disarm'd <HI>his</HI> and <HI>our enemies,</HI> the Devil, and all the powers of Hell, and hath carried them, as it were, in triumph, and made a shew of them openly, making them a spectacle of shame and scorn in the eyes of God and good Angels, as the <HI>Roman</HI> Generals us'd in their Triumphs to have their Captives carried disarm'd, and bound, after their Triumphal Charriots. <HI>From Ver. 8, to 16.</HI></P>
<P>He draws now a Conclusion from the former Argument, namely, That seeing the <HI>Ceremonial Law</HI> was abolished, therefore none should presume to condemn them, or lay sin to their charge, for using any of the <HI>Meats</HI> or <HI>Drinks</HI> prohibited by <HI>that Law,</HI> or for not observing the <HI>Jewish Festivals,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther <HI>anniversary,</HI> or <HI>monthly,</HI> or <HI>weekly,</HI> to wit, the <HI>Seventh-day-Sabbath.</HI> If any did so, they should not regard their censures. For these things were but shaddows<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">Ceremoniae fuerunt umbra rerum futurarum, cujus umbrae cor∣pus, h. e. complementum adumbra∣tum, est <HI>Christus.</HI></NOTE> of good things to come, and were to remain only untill the coming of Christ, who is the <HI>truth, body,</HI> and <HI>substance</HI> of them. Some of them pointed at <HI>Mo∣ral</HI> Sanctity, this Christ in his own person clearly taught and perfectly fulfill'd; some pointed at the expiation of sin, and this Christ truly wrought by his <HI>active</HI> and <HI>passive</HI> obedience; some presignified that eternal Rest which true Believers shall partake of hereafter. 'Tis not imaginable, that those <HI>Seducers,</HI> the Apostle here bends himself against, ever pleaded for or strove to maintain the Christian-Sabbath, the first day of the week. Therefore 'tis not probable, that in opposing them, he should implead that day. Besides, the <HI>Sab∣baths,</HI> here mentioned, were a shadow of things to come, whereas the <HI>Lords day</HI> is a memorial of some thing past, namely, the glorious Resurrection of Christ. The old <HI>Seventh day Sabbath</HI> might shaddow out something of Christ; and the <HI>Ancients</HI> generally understood it, to shaddow out his Rest <HI>that day</HI> in the grave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Concern∣ing the <HI>mora∣lity</HI> of the Christian-Sabbath, see Knowl. and Practise, <HI>pag.</HI> 256.</NOTE>. So that the Apostles Argument runs thus, Seeing the Ceremonial Ordinances were but shaddows and representations of good things to come, and to last only till Christ came; to observe them now under the Gospel, is in effect to say, That Christ the <HI>body,</HI> or <HI>substance</HI> is not yet come. <HI>Ver. 16, 16.</HI></P>

But thereby they boldly intruded<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">Penetrans in ea quae non vi∣dit, i. e. quae non novit, jus sibi fa∣ciens loquendi de incognitis.</NOTE> into things they knew nothing of, being vainly puft up with a conceit of their own corrupt minds. He shews, that these <HI>Angel-wor∣shippers</HI> do not acknowledg Christ for the <HI>Head</HI> of the Church while they apply themselves to Angels to be their Mediators to God; whereas <HI>He</HI> alone doth discharge the office of the <HI>Head,</HI> compleatly giving life, and growth to his whole Church, and to every member thereof.

<P N="8"><HI>8.</HI> He argues now against the second sort of errors which he mention'd, <HI>v. 8.</HI> namely, <HI>superstitious Rites, humane Traditions,</HI> and <HI>Doctrines of men.</HI> His Argument against them is to this purpose, that seeing they professed in their Bap∣tism to be spiritually dead with Christ, and to be freed by his death from the Levitical O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinances, [those Rudiments or Elements appointed by God to instruct the former World], why should they submit to superstitious Rites and Ordinances (of the like kind) invented by men? Could they think, that God would ab∣rogate the Ceremonies of his own Institution, that men might appoint theirs? Why as if they lived in the Old World, should they be under the Decrees and Traditions of men, which draw them to the Observation of things of the like nature? And he particularly instances, in one of those <HI>Traditions,</HI> or <HI>injuncti∣ons,</HI> namely, concerning <HI>abstinence from meats. Touch not, taste not, han∣dle not,</HI> that is, such or such meats; whereas all kind of meats are appointed by God for the use of men, and are to perish in the using. These observances, he acknowledges, were set off with a specious shew of <HI>wisdom,</HI> as if they were <HI>voluntary services,</HI> and free will offerings to God, giving him more than he re∣quired. They had also a shew of <HI>Humility,</HI> and submissive obedience to the In∣junctions of Superiors. Lastly, they had a shew of <HI>Mortification,</HI> and <HI>Auste∣rity</HI> to the body; they that practis'd them, not seeming to have <HI>those things</HI> in any esteem, which God hath made for the necessary satisfying of nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Capellus, <HI>sic</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>

<P N="9"><HI>9.</HI> Having thus dispatched the <HI>Doctrinal</HI> part of his Epistle, he comes now <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Chap."/> to the <HI>Practical.</HI> And in the first place, he gives some <HI>general</HI> exhortations, such as concern all Believers, and then some <HI>special,</HI> which belong to certain and particular conditions of men.</P>
<P>And first, Seeing they were risen with Christ, as he had intimated, <HI>v. 12, 13.</HI> of <HI>ch. 2.</HI> he exhorts them, that they should <HI>set their affections on things a∣bove,</HI> and that, because Christ their <HI>Head</HI> was above. And further, they had in their <HI>Baptism</HI> professed themselves dead to Sin and the World, and therefore ought really so to be, and to have their thoughts often upon their eternal life and bliss, which though it was hid from the eyes of the World, yet it was reserved for them in Heaven, (where Christ was), in the safe keeping of God, <HI>[see
<PB N="340" REF="178"/> 1 Pet. 1.4, 5.].</HI> And when Christ, who is the Author and Procurer of this blissful and eternal life for them, shall appear to judg the World, then they shall appear also with him in glory. Next, he presseth them, particularly, To morti∣fie their corrupt lusts, such as <HI>Uncleanness, inordinate Affection, evil Con∣cupiscence,</HI> and <HI>Covetousness,</HI> which he calls <HI>Idolatry,</HI> because it draweth a∣way our <HI>Love, Trust,</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> from God, and placeth them upon Wealth and Riches. These Lusts, he shews, are the several Members<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Those Lusts may be called <HI>Mem∣bers,</HI> because the Reason and Will of corrupt man doth produce Ope∣rations by them as the Body doth by the Member<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> of the <HI>Body of Sin;</HI> and are said to be <HI>upon the earth,</HI> because they draw the Soul down towards the earth, and are exercised upon earthly things as their proper Objects. Now that he might further pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss them to a serious endea∣vour to mortifie these Lusts, he tells them, that the wrath of God, with its dreadful effects, cometh upon those who go on contumaciously and im∣penitently in such ways. And they should remember how they themselves formerly liv'd in those sinful courses when they were moved and acted by such vile affections, and therefore now they ought more careful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to mortifie them. <HI>2.</HI> He exhorts them, to <HI>put away</HI> from them, that is, to <HI>mortifie</HI> their more <HI>spiritual Corruptions,</HI> instancing in anger, wrath, malice, (sins of the heart), and <HI>disgraceful con∣tumelious speaking</HI> against their Neighbours, as also all <HI>filthy communica∣tion,</HI> and <HI>lying,</HI> or saying, or suggesting any false thing, to the injury of others, which are sins of the Tongue. This he urges from the present spiritual estate of all true Believers among them, who had (as they profess'd in their Baptism) begun to <HI>put off</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">There were many Ceremo∣nies in <HI>Baptism,</HI> us'd in the Primi∣tive Church, viz. <HI>Putting off old Cloaths, drenching in water so as to seem to be buried in it, putting on new Cloaths at their coming out,</HI> to which <HI>Paul</HI> alludes in several places, as <HI>ch.</HI> 2.11, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.9, 10. <HI>Rom</HI> 6.4, 5. <HI>Thorndike</HI> of the Rights of the Church, <HI>ch.</HI> 4.</NOTE> <HI>the old man,</HI> that is, <HI>the corruption of Nature,</HI> with manifold actual trans∣gressions proceeding there-from; and <HI>put on the new m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> that is, <HI>new</HI> and <HI>spiritual qualities,</HI> whereby their cor∣rupt Nature is renewed, being illuminated with a saving and tranforming knowledg, and so conform'd to the Image of God, in such a manner, that in this <HI>new man,</HI> as in a Glass, Gods Wisdom, Righteousness, and Holiness may be clearly seen and discovered. And lest any should think that God regards not this inward spiritual renovation, but accepts men according to their external priviledges and conditions, he tells them, that now under the Gospel, neither the having of those things helps, nor does the want of them hinder any man, but whosoever believes in Christ, and is renewed by his Spirit, is ac∣cepted of God; He being an All sufficient Saviour to <HI>all such,</HI> and that in <HI>all respects</HI> whatsoever. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 12.</HI></P>
<P N="10"><HI>10.</HI> Having ended his exhortation to mortification, and putting off the <HI>old man,</HI> he comes now to exhort them. That as they had begin to put on the <HI>new,</HI> so they would put on all the parts and particular virtues belonging thereunto, as became such as were selected from the World, and effectually called to the know∣ledg of Christ, and to believe in him. And the excellent virtues, he exhorts them to put on, are these, namely, <HI>bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing,</HI> and <HI>freely forgiving one ano∣ther,</HI> (if any of them have just cause of complaint against another), even as Christ hath freely forgiven them. And above all those graces before-mention'd, he ex∣horts them, especially to put on <HI>Charity,</HI> which is the <HI>most perfect bond</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Charitas, vinculum perfectissi∣mum, animos scil. conjun∣gens.</NOTE>, binding, and knitting all the <HI>faithful,</HI> and members of the Church together. And that the love<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Et que cet amour de la paix que Dieu recommande, &amp;c. <HI>Amiraut.</HI></NOTE> of peace, (which God so effectually recommends to his Chil∣dren), should rule in their hearts, and bear sway in them, against all contrary motions; unto the entertaining of which they were called, and strongly obliged, being all members of one body, under one head, Christ Jesus. And that they may the better entertain and continue this peace among themselves, he exhorts them, to be thankful one to another for the benefits they receiv'd one from ano∣ther; and to cherish inclinations in themselves, not only of requiting, but of conferring benefits. And seeing 'tis the <HI>word of Christ,</HI> or the Doctrine of
<PB N="341" REF="178"/> the Scriptures, that teaches them all these divine L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssons; he advises them to read it diligently, and frequently to meditate on it, that it may dwell in them <HI>richly</HI> and <HI>copiously,</HI> and that they may be furnished thereby with all true and sound wisdom; so that their minds and hearts being filled with those di∣vine documents, they may be able to instruct and admonish one another, and stir up one anothers affections, by singing of these holy <HI>Psalms, Hymns,</HI> and <HI>Spiritual Songs,</HI> ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in contained; or compos'd <HI>agreeably</HI> thereunto, by the direction of the Spirit of God. Yet they must be careful they sing with affections rightly com∣pos'd (according to the measure of grace given them) that they may praise and glorifie God, not with their mouths only, but with their hearts. Lastly, He shuts up this Discourse with giving them <HI>one general Rule,</HI> viz. That what∣ever busin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss they enterprize or enter upon, whether it be by way of <HI>speech,</HI> or <HI>action,</HI> they should do it with invocation and calling upon God in the Name of Christ; through whose mediation also they should render praises to God (our gra∣cious Father in Christ) for any success afforded to them in any of their businesses, and for all his other mercies also. <HI>From Ver. 12, to 18.</HI></P>
<P N="10"><HI>10.</HI> He comes now to exhort them to the duties that concern particular Relations: <HI>1.</HI> He exhorts <HI>Wives</HI> willingly to submit themselves to their own Husbands (as is comely and decent) in all things lawful and agreeable to the will of the Lord. <HI>2.</HI> He enjoins <HI>Husbands</HI> to love their Wives, and not to be harsh and rigorous towards them in word or deed. <HI>3.</HI> He exhorts <HI>Childr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> to obey their Parents in all honest and lawful things, agreeable to the word of God (see <HI>Eph. 6.1.</HI>); for such obedience is highly pleasing to the Lord. <HI>4.</HI> He enjoins Parents to use their authority moderately over their Children, not irri∣tating or exasperating them by too much severity and rigorous dealing. <HI>5.</HI> That <HI>Servants</HI> be obedient in all lawful things to their own Masters (who according to the Laws of men, and in things temporal, belonging to the flesh, or body, have the rule over them, though not over their Consciences); and that they should not do their duties only when their Masters are present (as if they only took care to please them, and look'd no further); but with singleness of heart should shew all fidelity and diligence in their absence also, as those that fear the all-seeing eye of God. And whatever service they do for their Masters, they should do it <HI>heartily,</HI> and with <HI>good will</HI> (Eph. <HI>6.7.</HI>), as aiming to please God, and serve him therein, and not only and meerly to please and serve their Ma∣sters. And if they do so, they may assure themselves, that this their fidelity (being in conjunction with other graces) shall be rewarded with the inheritance of eternal life; because in <HI>thus</HI> serving their Masters, they serve their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; and he takes their service as done to him, and accordingly will give them the reward which he hath promised to all his faithful servants. And if any of them do meet with wrongs, and injuries, and hard usage from their Masters, he tells them (for their comfort) that there is a day coming when their wrongs shall be considered, and they righted; and the Lord will punish the <HI>wrong doer,</HI> and give him his just desert. For God is a righteous Judg, and there is no respect of persons with him. <HI>From Ver. 18, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, He exhorts <HI>Masters</HI> to give to their Servants that which is <HI>just</HI> and <MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="Chap."/> <HI>equal,</HI> either by strict Law or Contract, or by the Law of Charity; remem∣bring that they have a <HI>Master</HI> above them in Heaven, to whom they must give an account of their dealings with their Servants. <HI>Ver. 1.</HI></P>

And in particular, he desires them to pray for <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>Timothy,</HI> That God would afford them opportunities, and endue them with a
<PB N="342" REF="179"/> spirit of holy boldness and freedom in preaching the mystery of the Gospel, whereof <HI>Christ</HI> is the subject-matter, and the substance; for the publishing of which, he now suffered imprisonment. And more especially he desires them to pray for himself, that whilst he suffered for the Gospel, he might be enabled to make manifest and discover the deep and mysterious doctrine thereof, <HI>in such a manner,</HI> as was meet and fit, both in respect of the excellency of the Gospel it self; as also in respect of that great trust of the Apostleship committed unto him. <HI>2.</HI> He ex∣horts them to carry themselves <HI>wisely</HI> towards the <HI>Heathen</HI> and <HI>Infidels,</HI> among whom they lived (who were without the visible Church), and to im∣prove every opportunity of doing them good, and of gaining them to embrace the faith.

And the <HI>first</HI> of these he shews, is this; That he hath in his eternal <HI>election,</HI> even before the foundation of the world, separated them from other men, and designed to communicate these blessings to them, <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Christ, to the intent that they should be <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>blameless</HI> before men, and <HI>sincere</HI> as in his sight, living in the exercise of love to God, and one another. Yea, <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Christ, he hath predestinated them to the <HI>adoption</HI> of sons, that is, to be his adopted Children, not for any <HI>foreseen merit,</HI> or <HI>prepa∣rations</HI> of grace in them, but according to his own <HI>gratuitous mercy,</HI> and the good pleasure of his own will. And all this to the praise of his glorious grace, which is not only the End of his electing them <HI>before time,</HI> but the Cause also that <HI>in time</HI> he makes them lovely, and fit to be accepted of himself, <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> his beloved Son, in whom they have redemption through his blood shed on the Cross; and the satisfaction he hath made for them to his Father, hath acquired for them the remission of all their sins. And he hath caused the riches of his grace to abound towards them, in not only sending his Son to make atonement for them, but in revealing the Gospel to them, and thereby imparting that true wisdom (the right knowledg of Himself and his Son unto them) and that spiritual prudence which is requi∣site to direct them to order their Christian conversation aright. And he hath made known unto them that great <HI>mystery</HI> and <HI>secret</HI> of his will (which could not be known, either by Angels or men, before it was revealed) whereby is discovered and manifested what he hath resolved in his eternal Purpose, concerning the way of saving sinners, according to his own good pleasure and free grace. Which <HI>secret</HI> was then only clearly to be manifested, when <HI>that time</HI> arriv'd, unto which (according to his wise and admirable dispen∣sation) he hath reserved the fulness of his revelations, and the accomplish∣ment of his promises, which he before made. Now one part of this glorious <HI>mystery,</HI> is this, That <HI>sin</HI> having made a division between the <HI>glorious An∣gels</HI> in heaven, and <HI>corrupted men</HI> on earth, he hath found out a way to reconcile them by his Son; even as if a <HI>Prince</HI> that hath soveraignty over two Kingdoms, between which there is war, because one of them is fallen into rebellion whilst the other continues in their obedience, should by pardon∣ing the one, reconcile them, and compose the difference between them, and so form them into one Empire. And having hitherto spoken of <HI>Believers</HI> in ge∣neral, he now comes to make application of this his Doctrine, <HI>first,</HI> to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and next to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And first he shews, That the <HI>Jewish Be∣lievers</HI> (whereof himself was one) had, <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Christ, and by virtue of his merit and intercession (not for any merit in themselves) ob∣tained a right to a glorious inheritance in Heaven, being predestinated there∣unto according to the gracious purp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of God, <HI>who worketh all things ac∣cording to the counsel of his own will,</HI> that so his glorious Attributes, (<HI>viz.</HI> His infinite Wisdom, Goodness, and Mercy) manifested in that work, might be acknowledged and highly praised by them to whom the Gospel was first preached <HI>[Mat. 10.6. Acts 13.46.],</HI> and who were first called, and were the first who trusted or hoped in Christ for salvation, before there were any considerable number of Converts among the Gentiles. <HI>2dly,</HI> He shews, that not only <HI>believers among the Jews,</HI> but the believing <HI>Ephesians</HI> also, who were <HI>Gentiles,</HI> had <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Christ obtained a right to this Heavenly Inheritance, having been brought to believe in Him after the Gospel had been once preached to them. And then they were <HI>sealed</HI> for the Children of God, not by such an outward seal as <HI>Circumcision,</HI> but by the renewing and sanctifying work of the Spirit (whom God had graciously promised<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Spiritu promissionis,</HI> qui promissio∣nem Evange∣lii cordibus obsignat; vel <HI>spiritu promis∣so,</HI> quem scil.

And the bestowing this his holy Spirit on them, was an earnest of that heavenly inheritance, the full enjoyment whereof was not to be expected till the last day; at which time, all that

He tells these <HI>Ephesians</HI> therefore, that they ought to be sensible, that their salvation, from the first step to the last, depends on God's free favour and grace in Christ, and not on any des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt in themselves.

And <HI>this faith</HI> is also the gift of God, as <HI>salvation</HI> is. <HI>Works</HI> therefore have no <HI>meritorious</HI> or <HI>causal</HI> influence upon our salvation (which all men naturally have a propension to rely upon), but even our <HI>best works</HI> are excluded (being <HI>effects,</HI> not <HI>causes</HI> of that grace by which we are saved), that all ground of <HI>boasting</HI> and gloriation may be taken away from men, and all the glory ascrib'd intirely unto God, <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Jesus Christ. Yet lest any should think that the Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stle, by extolling <HI>free-grace,</HI> and excluding <HI>works</HI> from being the cause of our salvation, should seem to <HI>depreciate</HI> and vilifie works, and an holy life, as altogether unnecessary; he shews, they are absolutely re∣quired of those that shall be saved; because <HI>all true Converts,</HI> whether <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> are God's <HI>workmanship,</HI> that is, form'd to a new life, and <HI>renewed</HI> through the intervening mediation of Christ, that they may make conscience of bringing forth <HI>good works,</HI> to which God hath before prepared them (that they should walk in the practice of them), by giving them his holy Spirit, and thereby disposing and fitting their understandings and wils to produce them, and giving them the <HI>Rule</HI> of good works in his word to guide them.

<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> For the further establishment of these <HI>Ephesians</HI> in the Doctrine of Free-grace in Christ, he remembers them of their former miserable condition before their conversion, when they were in the <HI>flesh,</HI> that is in the corruption of Na∣ture, not having so much as <HI>Circumcision</HI> the sign of God's Covenant <HI>[Gen. 17.11.]</HI> which the Jews (who were circumcised in their flesh by the hands of men) made use of as a matter of reproach unto them. He remembers them also, That at that time they were so far from having any saving-interest in Christ, that they had not so much as any offer of Christ made to them by the Gospel; <HI>they were then aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel,</HI> having no union or communion either with the <HI>invisible</HI> Church of true believers, or with the <HI>visible</HI> Church of Professors, which was in those times among
<PB N="327" REF="181"/> the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> Deut. <HI>32.9.</HI> They were strangers to the <HI>Covenants</HI> of promise, <HI>that is,</HI> to God's Covenant and promise of Christ in due time to be exhibited, and of eternal life promised to sinners through faith in him; they were strangers to the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> made with <HI>Adam</HI> after the fall <HI>[Gen. 3.15.],</HI> and afterwards frequently renewed with <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob;</HI> with <HI>Israel</HI> upon <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> and with <HI>David:</HI> therefore called <HI>Covenants</HI> in the plural number, though it was always <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same Covenant</HI> for substance, though it had various discoveries and manifestations, and was various as to circumstance and manner of Administration. He tells them, they were so far from having any actual interest in the saving-blessings which were promised in this Covenant, that they had not this Covenant at all revealed to them, nor any right to the external priviledges of it; yea, further, they were such persons as <HI>had no hope,</HI> that is, no true ground to hope for the forgiveness of their sins, or salvation, they being <HI>without God in the world,</HI> that is, without any clear knowledg of the true God. But, now, <HI>they</HI> who were before <HI>afar off from Christ,</HI> his <HI>Church,</HI> his <HI>Covenant,</HI> any <HI>saving-hope,</HI> and <HI>from a true knowledg of God,</HI> were now brought <HI>nigh to God,</HI> and <HI>united to his Church,</HI> through faith in Christ, who by his death and bloody sacrifice had purchased that great blessing for them. For he is the only author and procurer of our peace with God. And whereas be∣fore, <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> were so much separated by reason of their Religion and religious rites, he hath now united them into <HI>one</HI> and <HI>the same Church.</HI> For he hath taken away the <HI>Ceremonial Law,</HI> which was the <HI>middle-wall</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He seems to allude to that <HI>sept</HI> or <HI>wall</HI> in the Temple, that separated the Court of the <HI>Jews</HI> from that of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></NOTE> of partition between them, and the occasion of a perpetual standing-strife, while the <HI>Jews</HI> reproached the <HI>Gentiles</HI> for want of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> reproached the <HI>Jews</HI> for having of it, and for observing other of the <HI>Mosaical</HI>-rites, which they judged absurd. Now Christ hath abolished <HI>this enmity</HI> by his death which he suffer'd in the flesh, and taken away the ground of it, having removed the <HI>law of commandments,</HI> consisting in insti∣tutions and ordinations concerning certain ceremonial rites belonging to the ex∣ternal worship of God (which were prescribed as so many types and shadows of Christ to come, <HI>Heb. 9.10.</HI>), that so he might form all the converted among Jews and Gentiles (who believe in him) into <HI>one people</HI> or <HI>Church</HI> under himself their Head (called here one <HI>new man,</HI> because renewed by the Holy Ghost), and so make peace between them. And, being thus united into one <HI>Body</HI> or <HI>Church,</HI> he hath reconciled them to God by the sacrifice, of himself on the Cross▪ having removed the enmity which was before between God and them by reason of their sins; and the enmity that was between thems lves, by reas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of the diversity of their Religions. And he further shews That Christ had published the glad tydings of this peace and reconci∣liation (which was purchased by himself on the Cross) both to the <HI>Jews</HI> who were within the visible Church, and to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who were without the bounds of it; though to the later he preached not <HI>immediately</HI> in his own person (<HI>Mat. 15.24.</HI> except to some few, who were the first-fruits of the rest), but <HI>mediately</HI> by his Apostles, and their Successors, <HI>Mat. 28.19.</HI> And through this Saviour, he tells them, that both believing-Jews and Gentiles have equal liberty of access to God, as to a reconciled Father, by the assistance of that one Spirit, who quickens and actuates the graces of all the people of God.

And therefore seeing he was persecuted for this reason <HI>especially,</HI> because he preached the Gospel to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and asserted their interest in Christ, and <HI>through him,</HI> in all the blessings of the Covenant of Grace, he desires they would not be discouraged or disheartned at any thing that shall befall him in this cause, and he tells them it would be their glory if they were not. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 14.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> That they may not be discouraged, he tells them, He daily bows his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus (and in him the Father of <HI>all the regenerate,</HI> whether triumphant in Heaven, or militant here on Earth; and that whether <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> whom he will have named his Children, counting them for his Family) that he would according to his rich and glo∣rious mercy furnish them by his Spirit with a daily encrease of spiritual strength in their minds and hearts, whereby they may be enabled to resist the Devil, and all the Enemies and Adversaries of their souls, which they shall meet with in their Christian course; that being firmly united to Christ by faith, he may constantly dwell in their hearts by the gracious operations of his holy Spirit, quickning, ruling, and fashioning them daily more and more to his own will.

<P>Having thus dispatch'd the <HI>doctrinal</HI> part of this Epistle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 4.</NOTE> he comes now to the <HI>practical,</HI> wherein he exhorts the <HI>Ephesians</HI> to divers Christian duties, in
<PB N="330" REF="183"/> testimony of their gratitude to God for all those benefits before-mentioned. And first, to <HI>general duties,</HI> common to all Christians; and then to more <HI>special</HI> and <HI>peculiar,</HI> to some particular Relations. The more <HI>general duties</HI> he ex∣horts to, are these contained in this Chap. and to the <HI>22</HI> verse of Chap. <HI>5.</HI> And in the first place, as an Apostle that was at that time a prisoner for the Cause of Christ, he exhorts them to walk worthy of their heavenly vocation; expres∣sing the worthiness and answerableness of their walking, in these particulars: <HI>1.</HI> In lowliness of mind, and meekness. <HI>2.</HI> In long-suffering, and a loving-for∣bearance one of another. <HI>3.</HI> That they would endeavour to maintain an union of heart and spirit, of judgment and affection, among the members of the Church; even such an union whereof the Spirit of God is the Author: which union is maintained by a peaceable disposition and deportment, that being the bond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">V. 3. In vin∣culo] per vin∣culum, i. e. per pacem quae a∣nimos con∣jungit. <HI>Vatab.</HI></NOTE> or ligament that binds Christians together; whereas discord and divi∣sion cuts that bond asunder. And he inforces this exhortation to peace and unity, by an argument taken from those many things wherein the Church and all the true members thereof agree. He instances in seven, which are as so many bonds and engagements to this union. <HI>1.</HI> The whole <HI>invisible Church</HI> of real Believers, is but <HI>one mystical body,</HI> knit by <HI>faith</HI> to Christ their Head, and by the bond of <HI>love</HI> among themselves; and the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> made up of all Christians, and true Churches in the world, is also <HI>one;</HI> be∣cause they have the same <HI>King, Laws, Word, Sacraments</HI> of admission and nutrition, which they visibly subject themselves unto. <HI>2.</HI> There is <HI>one Spirit,</HI> who by his gifts and graces animates, moves, and governs this Body or Society of true believers. <HI>3.</HI> The <HI>hope</HI> following upon their effectual vocation is <HI>one,</HI> that is, there is but <HI>one object</HI> of their hope, <HI>viz.</HI> Heaven and Eternal Glory. There is but one Heaven prepared for all the Saints; and their hoping to meet and live for ever in that one and the same Heaven, should be an argument to them to live in peace and concord here. <HI>4.</HI> There is <HI>one Lord Jesus,</HI> who by his work of redemption hath obtained a right to rule over his people as Mediator, Lord-Deputy, and Administrator, under his Father, <HI>Phil. 2.9, 10, 11.</HI> And Christ being not divided <HI>[1 Cor. 1.13.],</HI> there ought not to be any divisions in the Church. <HI>5.</HI> There is <HI>one Faith,</HI> that is, one true and saving-faith by which both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are saved, namely, faith in the <HI>Messiah. 6. One Baptism,</HI> by which we own Christ, and profess our selves his followers, and take on us <HI>his Livery.</HI> There were indeed divers <HI>washings</HI> among the <HI>Jews;</HI> but now <HI>one Baptism only</HI> among Christians. <HI>7. One God,</HI> who is the Father of Christ, and <HI>in him</HI> of all true believers [see <HI>Deut. 6.4. 1 Cor. 8.6.],</HI> who hath a <HI>soveraignty</HI> over <HI>all his creatures,</HI> whose powerful Providence runneth <HI>through them all,</HI> upholding them in their <HI>being;</HI> directing, disposing, governing of them <HI>all,</HI> and <HI>all their actions,</HI> and is <HI>in all the truly regenerate</HI> by the gracious operations of his Spirit. <HI>From Ver. 1, to the 7.</HI></P>
<P>Having press'd them to endeavour after unity, by an argument taken from those many things wherein the Church and all the true members thereof agree; he now answers an objection which he foresaw some would be apt to make against what he had said. They would object, That though there be <HI>many things</HI> wherein the Church and all the true members thereof <HI>agree;</HI> yet there are <HI>many things</HI> also wherein they differ. To this he answers, that the <HI>di∣versity of gifts and graces,</HI> and <HI>their divers measures,</HI> bestowed by Christ upon the several members of the Church, do all tend to <HI>unity,</HI> seeing they all come from <HI>one</HI> and the same <HI>Author,</HI> and are all given for the promoting <HI>one</HI> and <HI>the same End.</HI> This he proves out of <HI>Psal. 62.18.</HI> where <HI>David</HI> by a prophetical spirit speaking of <HI>things to come</HI> as already <HI>past,</HI> foretels that Christ should in a triumphant manner, ascend up on high, that is, to the highest Heavens, and should lead <HI>captivity captive;</HI> that is, as he had upon the <HI>Cross</HI> foiled all the spiritual enemies of his Church and people, and
<PB N="331" REF="183"/> begun to triumph over them; so in <HI>his ascension</HI> he should continue the tri∣umph [see <HI>Judg. 5.12.</HI>] as Conquerors us'd to do. And as <HI>they</HI> us'd to scatter the spoils, and other rich gifts, among the applauding-Citizens and Soldiers, so should Christ <HI>at his ascension</HI> pour forth and distribute a large measure of the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit unto his Church, and the seve∣ral members thereof: which <HI>Prophecy</HI> the Apostle shews was now fulfilled by Christ. He further declares, That Christ <HI>ascending</HI> to Heaven by his own di∣vine power, did presuppose his foregoing humiliation and abasement, in all the degrees of it, even his descending to the <HI>lower parts of the earth;</HI> which <HI>expression</HI> is to be understood, not by comparing the <HI>parts</HI> of the earth among themselves, but by comparing <HI>Earth</HI> with <HI>Heaven,</HI> the Earth being the lowest part of the World. And particularly, it either pointeth out his <HI>conception</HI> in the womb of the Virgin [see <HI>Psal. 139.15.</HI>], or his <HI>burial</HI> [expressed by a like phrase, <HI>Mat. 12.40.</HI>], with all the other steps of his humiliation inter∣vening. So that the <HI>Person</HI> who thus descended to take on him our humane nature, with the sensless infirmities thereof, is the <HI>same</HI> also who ascended to the highest Heavens, the seat of Majesty and Glory, far above all the <HI>vi∣sible Heavens,</HI> and that for <HI>this end,</HI> That he might <HI>fulfil</HI> all <HI>prophecies</HI> and <HI>predictions</HI> concerning himself (whereof this of <HI>David</HI> was one), and all those parts of his <HI>Mediatory Office</HI> which were yet to be perform'd in Heaven; and particularly, that he might <HI>fill</HI> and adorn all the members of his Church with the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit. He further sheweth, This was the end of Christ's appointing those <HI>extraordinary</HI> and <HI>ordinary Officers</HI> in his Church, which he then reckons up. First, <HI>Apostles,</HI> whom he says Christ did give at his <HI>ascension</HI> (though he sent forth some of them before, <HI>Mat. 10.1.</HI>), because some were then added to the Apostles [<HI>Acts 1.26.</HI> and <HI>9.15.</HI> and all of them were then solemnly installed and publickly confirmed by Christ in their Office, by his visible pouring forth the gifts of the spirit in an extraordinary manner upon them, <HI>Acts 2. v: 3, 4. 2. Prophets,</HI> see <HI>1 Cor. 12.28.</HI> who foretold things to come; and by the extraordinary as∣sistance of the Spirit, and Divine Revelation, expounded the writings of the old Prophets. <HI>3. Evangelists,</HI> who were the companions of the Apostles in their travels <HI>[Gal. 2.1, 3.],</HI> and sent out by <HI>them</HI> as occasion offered it self, to water such Churches as <HI>they</HI> had planted <HI>[1 Cor. 3.6. 1 Tim. 1, 3.]</HI> and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to remain until the Apostles should recall them, <HI>2 Tim. 4.9.</HI> Such were <HI>Timothy, Titus, Silvanus, Apollos, Tychicus,</HI> &amp;c. Lastly, <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> which, according to some, are two distinct Offices, and so they think they are distinguished <HI>Rom. 12.7, 8.</HI> and <HI>1 Cor. 12.8.</HI> In so much that by <HI>Pastors</HI> (as they conceive) are meant those, who besides their ability to open the Text, are chiefly gifted <HI>with the word of wisdom,</HI> wisely and powerfully to apply the word, for working upon the affections as the matter requireth. And the <HI>Teacher</HI> (to them) is the <HI>Catechist,</HI> who is gifted with the word of knowledg or ability to open the Scripture, and to establish <HI>Truth</HI> and confute <HI>Error.</HI> But there are others that take <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> for <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> Office. However, the Apostle shews, that all <HI>these Gifts</HI> and <HI>Offices,</HI> though divers in themselves, yet are an argument to unity, be∣cause they are <HI>all</HI> given for the compacting and knitting together the <HI>Saints</HI> by the work of the Ministry,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In opus in ministerii] in opus dispen∣sationis, i. e. ad dispensan∣dum &amp; docen∣dum verbum <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] pro <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> vel <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Hebraicè Pisc.</NOTE> and for the edifying the body of Christ, and the particular members thereof, in <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>holiness:</HI> which work of the Mi∣nistry in thus edifying the body of Christ, is to last and continue to the day of judgment, till all that shall be saved, come (one after another), by means of <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same faith</HI> (for kind, <HI>viz.</HI> faith in Christ) and the acknow∣ledgment of the Son of God, unto a <HI>perfect man,</HI> that is, till Christ's my∣stical body shall be compleat and perfect, and attain its full stature. He shews also, that another end unto which the work of preaching is subservient, is, To preserve from error, and that we should not be like children, wavering and inconstant, tossed with every wind of doctrine, nor be deceived with the <HI>cheat∣ing

And that he might shew the <HI>com∣munion</HI> that the members of the Church-Militant have with Christ their <HI>Head,</HI> and with <HI>one another;</HI> and how all Gifts and Offices in the Church tend to the edification of the whole body, he uses a similitude taken from a <HI>natural body,</HI> which is wade up of several members joined together, and by cer∣tain <HI>junctures</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>of supply, viz.</HI> the <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Arteries</HI> (by which the blood and spirits are conveyed to the several parts, from the <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Heart</HI>) the particular members do not only receive nourishment to themselves, but con∣vey it from one to another, so that every member receives due encrease in mea∣sure and proportion to what it was to <HI>be,</HI> and to <HI>act;</HI> and so the whole body grows to maturity. Thus it is with all <HI>sincere believers,</HI> viz. with all the true mem∣bers of the Body of Christ, the Church Militant: They are joined to Christ the <HI>Head</HI> by <HI>faith,</HI> and to one another by <HI>love.</HI> And all the <HI>Offices</HI> and <HI>Functions</HI> of the Church are <HI>junctures of supply</HI> and <HI>subministration;</HI> through which, as through so many Channels, the knowledg of saving-truth, and matter of spiritual nourishment, is conveyed from Christ the <HI>Head,</HI> to the particular Members. And by that spiritual nourishment communicated to them from Christ (by the means of these conveyances), they grow in grace, accor∣ding to the effectual working of the Holy Ghost, which he works in every member, imparting to it such a measure of grace as he judgeth convenient, according to the place and function it holdeth in the body, and the use which he intends to make of it for the good of the Church: and so the <HI>whole body</HI> grows up in <HI>love</HI> to Christ the <HI>Head,</HI> and the <HI>particular members</HI> in <HI>love</HI> and <HI>charity</HI> one towards another. <HI>From Ver. 7, to the 17.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He earnestly beseeches and obtests them in the <HI>Name</HI> of the Lord Je∣sus, and as they would answer it to <HI>Him,</HI> Not to walk as other unconverted <HI>Gentiles</HI> walk, following that which their unrenewed minds dictates unto them, having their understandings darkned, so that they see not that which by the light of Nature they might see, being utterly estranged from that <HI>spi∣ritual life</HI> which Christ communicates to those who believe in him. And all this, through the great ignorance that is in them; the cause of which igno∣rance, is the great hardness of heart which they have contracted through a long course and custom in sin; insomuch that they wilfully refuse good, and are obstinately bent upon evil; being hardned, not only <HI>naturally</HI> from their birth <HI>(Psal. 51.5.),</HI> but <HI>voluntarily</HI> by their own wilfulness, <HI>Exod. 8.15;</HI> and <HI>judicially</HI> by God, <HI>Exod. 9.12.</HI> Yea, in a kind of senslesness and fearlesness of God's judgments, he shews, they give up themselves to all impurity, and to the committing of all the unnatural sins of the flesh, and that with gree∣diness. But he tells them, <HI>the knowledg of Christ,</HI> and his Doctrine (wherein they had been instructed), was utterly inconsistent with such dissoluteness and prodigious licentiousness; and this they would make to appear, if they had learn'd Christ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Si ita edo∣cti estis Evan∣gelium, quo modo illud revera se ha∣bet, prout à Jesu ipso prae∣dicatum est. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> (speaking to them by his Ministers) in such a manner as they ought, and had been inwardly and effectually taught by his spirit, and had re∣ceived the <HI>divine truth</HI> as it was preached by himself, and is delivered in his Gospel. Which <HI>Gospel</HI> or <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Christ, he shews, does injoin them, <HI>1.</HI> That they daily endeavour to put off and divest themselves of the <HI>old cor∣rupt nature</HI> (which bears a resemblance of the old <HI>Adam</HI>) by which they were led in the days of their unregeneracy, and which daily grows worse and more corrupt, and more corrupts and depraves a man by its deceitful lust∣ings<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Per cupidi∣tates seducen∣tes. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE>, and carries him on to destruction, if it be not resisted and subdued. <HI>2,</HI> That they seriously endeavour to have their understandings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Alludit ad ritum Baptis∣mi in quo ve∣stes depone∣bantur &amp; re∣sumebantur. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> renewed, and to get a new quality of divine light in the supream power of their

<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> He gives now <HI>six particular precepts</HI> belonging to the second Table; <HI>1.</HI> To abstain from all <HI>lying</HI> (which is a sin prejudicial to humane society), and that they labour always to speak the truth. For we are all members of the same body of mankind. As therefore in the natural body, if one mem∣ber should defraud and circumvent another, it would be accounted monstrous; so it must needs be in them, if they allowed themselves in lying, to the inju∣ring of any man in the world, much more of their fellow-Christians, between whom there is a straiter union. <HI>2.</HI> He advises them to take heed of <HI>sinful anger,</HI> which usually is rashly kindled <HI>[Prov. 14.17],</HI> and upon very light cause; and ordinarily exceeds the just bounds. If they find any such com∣motion or inflammation of mind in themselves as this, he exhorts them to suppress it <HI>speedily,</HI> even before <HI>the Sun go down;</HI> lest by giving way to it, and persevering in it, they should open the door to Satan to enter into their hearts, who would be ready enough to incite them, by his uncessant suggesti∣ons, to act some great evil or mischief. <HI>3.</HI> He exhorts these among them, who in the time of their <HI>Paganism</HI> and <HI>unregeneracy</HI> had made no consci∣ence of <HI>Stealing,</HI> that now they should do so no more; but to be laborious in a good and honest Calling, that they may be able to spare something for the supplying the necessities of others. <HI>4.</HI> He gives directions for the right order∣ing of the <HI>tongue,</HI> and forbids all corrupt and unsavoury communication and discourse, such as argueth a rotten and an unrenewed heart <HI>[Mat. 12.35.]</HI> and which is contagious and infectious to the hearers. He prescribes, That their speech should be seasoned with the salt of divine wisdom, that it may be a means of conveying grace to others, and working gracious effects upon them. And he inforces his exhortation with this reason, Because by corrupt commu∣nication they would <HI>grieve the holy Spirit of God:</HI> Not that he can pro∣perly be grieved; but he is said to be <HI>grieved,</HI> when we do <HI>that</HI> which in it self is apt to grieve him, if he were capable thereof; and which provokes him to do <HI>that,</HI> which <HI>grieved persons</HI> use to do, namely, to withdraw his gracious and comforting-presence. And all <HI>true believers</HI> should especially take heed, that they do not grieve this holy Spirit, because by his renewing and sanctifying of their hearts, he imprints the draught and lineaments, as it were, of his own image upon them, whereby they are not only set apart, and marked, and <HI>sealed,</HI> as his peculiar goods; but themselves also may be thereby assured that they are <HI>His,</HI> and shall be safely kept under <HI>that seal,</HI> until the day of the <HI>redemption of their bodies,</HI> that is, the <HI>resurrection</HI> and <HI>day of judgment,</HI> Rom. <HI>8.23.</HI> Lastly, He amplifies and enlarges his second precept concerning the restraining of <HI>anger,</HI> by forbidding the several branches, degrees, and effects of it, such as are, <HI>bitterness, wrath,</HI> and <HI>fierceness,</HI> and such <HI>an∣ger</HI> as carries with it desire of revenge. Also <HI>clamour,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>terous words, and loud menaces, <HI>evil speaking,</HI> or disgraceful contumelies; and <HI>malice,</HI> which is a rooted and setled anger. And as a proper remedy against all these, he ex∣horts them to exercise mutual kindness; neither carrying it <HI>loftily,</HI> nor <HI>mo∣rosely;</HI> and to be <HI>tender-hearted,</HI> having a sense of the miseries and infir∣mities of others; freely pardoning wrongs and injuries, setting God s ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mple before their eyes, who freely pardons believers, <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> his Son, all their offences. <HI>From Ver. 25, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>Seeing they did all profess thems<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves to be Children of God by adoption,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 5.</NOTE> he exhorts them to imitate their heavenly Father in the exercise of <HI>kind∣ness, mercy,</HI> and <HI>forgiveness;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereby to evidence themselves to be his
<PB N="354" REF="185"/> Children <HI>indeed.</HI> And that they should <HI>walk in love,</HI> that is, that all their actions towards their Neighbours should be ordered by love: which exhortation he enforces by an argument taken from Christ's <HI>example,</HI> who loved us, and eminently evidenced his love, by giving himself freely, and of his own accord, even unto death for us; yea, offering himself a Propitiatory-sacrifice unto God, as was typified by the Levitical offerings and sacrifices; which sacrifices was highly acceptable to God, and is said to be of a <HI>sweet savour</HI> unto him [see <HI>Gen. 8.21.</HI>], because thereby he was satisfied and appeased. Next, he enjoins them to take heed of <HI>Fornication,</HI> and all other sorts of uncleanness, so usual among unconverted Gentiles in that City. As also, to beware of <HI>Covetousness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In talibus urbibus maxi∣mè regnabat perlas &amp; nefas rem augendi cupido.

And lest any should think within themselves, that these things he had now reproved, were no such <HI>great matters,</HI> or at least not so dangerous as he affirmed, he tells them, That all such suggestions were vain and deceiving; for those sins would certainly draw down the wrath of God upon those children of disobedience that went on in them, as they had done upon <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI> He advises them therefore, Not to join with those that lived in those sins, lest they should partake with them in their pun∣ishments. And he backs his advice with an argument taken from that <HI>blessed change</HI> that was wrought in them since they became Christians. They were formerly ignorant of God, and the way to Heaven (having blind minds, un∣renewed hearts, and living prophane lives), and were in a state of misery, liable to the wrath and curse of God [see <HI>chap. 4.18.</HI>]. But now they were <HI>light in the Lord,</HI> that is, enlightned by the Spirit of God, and brought to the saving-knowledg of God and Christ, and into a state of favour with God, and of <HI>joy</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> and filial confidence flowing from the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nse thereof; so that there was as much difference between this their present and former condition, as between darkness and light. And seeing they were so changed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y should walk as the children of light. And he tells them, That the fruits of the spirit, dwelling in the hearts of the children of light, are all sorts of
<PB N="355" REF="185"/> <HI>goodness, righteousness, truth,</HI> and <HI>fidelity.</HI> And they that are children of the light, and acted by the holy Spirit, must labour to bring forth those fruits, and must diligently search and enquire what is the good and acceptable will of God, as 'tis revealed in his word, that they may conform themselves unto it. And further, he advises them to take heed of being partners or compa∣nions of wicked men in their sins (which are <HI>works of darkness,</HI> and which bring those that live and dye in them, <HI>without repentance,</HI> unto utter dark∣ness; but instead thereof (as occasion offered it self, and Christian prudence required, they should seriously reprove them: And if they could not conveni∣ently do it by words, yet they should be sure to do it by the holiness of their con∣versation, which might possibly prove a more effectual way of reclaiming them. For (he tells them) the wickedness of the unconverted Gentiles was so abominable, that it was even a shame to mention what was done by them in secret. But<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>V. 13.</HI> But all things being discovered by the light, are made manifest. <HI>Sic legit Hammondus.</HI></NOTE> if those wicked practises were reproved by the light of God's word in the mouth of the <HI>Reprover,</HI> or by the light of his holy life, then they would be made manifest in their black and ugly colours, unto the actors of them.

<P>And hereby he shews, they would imitate God himself whose great design in his word is, To convince men of their sins, and to call them to repentance, and thereby to convey the light and knowledg of Jesus Christ unto them. For his perpetual voice in the Gospel is, according to that saying of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> chap. <HI>60.</HI> v. <HI>1.</HI> (to which he seems here to allude) <HI>Arise thou that sleepest;</HI> and <HI>Arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> v. 14.] <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] nimi∣rum in Evan∣gelii perpetuo tenore.

And further, that they labour to be acquainted with the <HI>will of God</HI> revealed in his word, whereby they may be directed in all their particular duties, and how to avoid the snares and temptations they may meet with. And because they lived among people much given to <HI>drunkenness,</HI> he cautions them to take heed of all ex∣cessive and immoderate drinking of wine, which transports men to insolent and outragious practises; and instead of filling themselves with wine (as those Hea∣thens us'd to do), they should labour to be replenish'd with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, which will fill their souls with joy and gladness, more than wine can fill drunkards with merriment. The wine, when it mounts into the head with its fumes, it makes a man talk idly and foolishly, and often transports him to sing lascivious and petulant songs. But when the Holy Ghost fills the heart of any man, if it excite him (as it does sometimes) to <HI>sing,</HI> it carries him to sing and set forth the praises of God. He exhorts them there∣fore to converse together as becomes Christians; and if they <HI>sing,</HI> that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir spiritual joy should vent it self in a melodious singing the praises of God in <HI>Psalms,</HI> and <HI>divine Hymns</HI> and <HI>spiritual Songs;</HI> their <HI>understandings, hearts,</HI> and <HI>affections,</HI> going along with the <HI>matter sung;</HI> so as it may tend to the glory of God, and their mutual edification: For they should be <HI>always</HI> that is, upon <HI>all due occasions,</HI> ready to offer up praise to God for all his mercies both <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>temporal,</HI> and that <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> the inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es∣sion of Christ, by vertue of whose merits and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction only, our s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvices of <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>praise</HI> find acceptance with God [see <HI>Eph. 1.6.].

<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> Having exhorted them to such duties as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>long to all Christians in <HI>ge∣neral,</HI> he comes now to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se which belong to them, <HI>as they are members of Families.</HI> And first, he premizes, that they should all observe that <HI>order</HI> which God had placed them in, whether <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>civil,</HI> and accordingly
<PB N="356" REF="186"/> <HI>submit</HI> themselves one to another, <HI>in the fear of God;</HI> that is, so as they may evidence and testife, that they truly fear God, who injoins that submission. This premized, He then exhorts <HI>Wives</HI> to submit themselves to their own Husbands, having a due esteem for them, which is a <HI>great root</HI> of love and submission. And the manner of this submission must be <HI>as to the Lord;</HI> that is, it must be <HI>willing</HI> and <HI>sincere,</HI> as resembling that submission they perform to Christ. It must flow from conscience and respect to that duty which they owe to Christ, who accounts that subjection flowing from respect to his Ordi∣nance, as obedience to himself. The grounds of this subjection, he shews, must be, <HI>1.</HI> The Husband's <HI>headship</HI> and <HI>superiority,</HI> by reason of his <HI>Sex;</HI> in which respect the Man is call'd the <HI>Image of God</HI> in a sense peculiar to him∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf which agreeth not to the woman, <HI>1 Cor. 11.7.</HI> And God would have some resemblance of Christ's <HI>headship over the Church,</HI> held forth in the Husband's over the Wife. And as Christ is the <HI>Saviour of his body,</HI> and his dominion tends to the procuring and bringing about the <HI>Church</HI>'s good and salvation; so the Husband's superiority and authority is given him for the procuring the good and welfare of his Wife; namely, that he may defend her from injuries, provide comfortably for her, as he is able; and direct her in things necessary, according to his power. And upon this account the Wife ought to practise this duty of submission, because her Husband's power and authority over h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, is for her good. For his dominion is not to be <HI>tyrannical</HI> or <HI>rigorous,</HI> but <HI>loving, gentle,</HI> and <HI>amiable;</HI> and such as the Wife may look upon as a <HI>mercy</HI> to her self, as well as a <HI>dignity</HI> to her Husband. And as Christ is the <HI>Head</HI> of the Church for <HI>its good,</HI> so the <HI>Husband</HI> is appointed the head of the Wife <HI>for her good</HI> and <HI>benefit.</HI> As therefore all that are <HI>regenerate,</HI> and <HI>true members</HI> of the Church, do willingly subject themselves to Christ; so he shews 'tis fit that <HI>Wives</HI> should be subject to their own Husbands <HI>in every thing</HI> that is lawful and honest. In the next place he comes to the duty of <HI>Husbands;</HI> exhorting them, Not to abuse that su∣periority which God hath given them over their Wives, by a <HI>domineering, harsh,</HI> or <HI>bitter</HI> carriage [see <HI>Col. 3.18.</HI>]; but instead thereof, to <HI>love</HI> them with a <HI>special</HI> and <HI>conjugal love,</HI> such as no other must share in. This he inforces from Christ's example, who loved his Church not in <HI>words</HI> only, but in <HI>deeds;</HI> testifying the greatness of his love, by giving himself for it [see <HI>v. 2.</HI> of this <HI>chap.</HI>], that he might translate it from a state of <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> to a state of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>life;</HI> that he might regenerate and san∣ctifie it, that he might cleanse it, and do away the <HI>guilt</HI> of sin cleaving to believers, <HI>by justifying their persons [Rom. 8.1.];</HI> and the <HI>filth,</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> and <HI>activity</HI> of sin, by the renovation of their natures. And the external means by which be effecteth all this, are, <HI>1. Baptism,</HI> call'd here, the <HI>washing of water.</HI> And, <HI>2. The Ministry of his word.</HI> And his end in thus cleansing and sanctifying his Church in this life, is, That it may be holy, not having blemish, spot, or deformity (that is, exempt from blame and reprehension); when it shall be presented to himself, as the Bride to the Bride∣groom, for the solemn consummation of the begun-marriage, <HI>Rev. 19.7.</HI> And according to this example, Husbands ought to love their Wives even as their own bodies, For there is so near a union between them, that he that loves his Wife, loves himself. 'Tis therefore as unnatural for a man, not to love his Wife, as to hate his own flesh; which all men are so far from doing, that they nourish and cherish it, and do all things imaginable for its preserva∣tion. And after the same manner does Christ also nourish and cherish his Church, and provide all things necessary for it, because his Church is as nearly join'd to him, as <HI>Eve</HI> was to <HI>Adam,</HI> of whom (being made of a rib taken out of his side with flesh on it) he said, <HI>Gen. 2.23. This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my self.</HI> So all believers, by reason of the spiritual union betw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en Christ and them, are members of his <HI>body,</HI> and as it were of his <HI>flesh</HI> and <HI>bones,</HI> as <HI>Eve</HI> was said to be of <HI>Adam</HI>'s. And

Where∣upon, as he was called an <HI>Hebrew</HI> from <HI>Heber,</HI> Gen. 14.13. so all his posterity were called <HI>Hebrews</HI> from him.</NOTE> (that is, the believing-<HI>Jews,</HI> the posterity of <HI>Abraham</HI>), and sent it by <HI>Mark;</HI> who having delivered it where <HI>Paul</HI> appointed him. went away to <HI>Peter</HI> now at <HI>Babylon;</HI> for <HI>Peter</HI> mentioneth <HI>Mark</HI> there with him, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.13; and seems to speak directly of this Epistle in those words of his, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.15, <HI>And account that the long-suffering of the Lord is salvation, even as our beloved Brother Paul, according unto the wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you.</HI> Now that <HI>Paul</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Some think <HI>Paul</HI> did not express his name in the beginning of this Epistle, as he us'd to do in others, lest some Jews (who were possess'd with prejudice against him) if they had seen his name in the beginning of it, might have been hindred from duly weighing the matters he wrote of.</NOTE> did write unto them while he was a Prisoner at <HI>Rome,</HI> those words <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.34, do sufficiently intimate, <HI>For ye had compassion of me in my bonds,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The occasion of this Epistle seems to be this. Many of the believing-<HI>Hebrews</HI> had entertained the faith of Christ, and yet adhered too much to <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Levitical Priesthood</HI> and <HI>Ordinances,</HI> and possibly were something doubtful in their minds whether <HI>Jesus of Nazareth</HI> were indeed the <HI>true Messias</HI> or no. Yet for their entertaining him so far as they did, they were not only reproached and reviled by their Countrey-men, as <HI>Apostates from the Law;</HI> but were greatly persecuted by them. The Apostle understanding their state, wrote this Epistle, partly to <HI>instruct</HI> them, and partly to <HI>support</HI> and encourage them.</P>

<PB N="361" REF="188"/> dulness and improficiency, and exhorts them to make progress (and not to stick in their first principles), and to be stedfast in the faith, representing to them the horrible danger of re∣lapsing after they have tasted the gifts of the Spirit.

And 'twas very fit it should be so, because <HI>(3.)</HI> it was by him, as having his being from eternity, and being the <HI>Eternal Wisdom of the Father</HI> that the <HI>Worlds were made,</HI> that is, all things <HI>above</HI> and <HI>below, visible</HI> and <HI>invi∣sible;</HI> by him (I say) not as a meer Instrument, but as a primary and prin∣cipal Agent therein with the Father, <HI>Joh. 5.19. Joh. 1.3. Col. 1.16. (4.)</HI> He is the <HI>brightness</HI> of his Father's glory, and the <HI>express Image</HI> of his Person. As the brightness issuing from the <HI>Sun</HI> is of the same nature with the <HI>Sun,</HI> and cometh naturally and necessarily from the Sun, and is of the same conti∣nuance with the Sun, and yet the Sun and the brightness are distinct each from other, and the one is not the other; so the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son</HI> are of one and the same essence, they are <HI>coeternal;</HI> the Son is from the Father by eternal generation, and the Person of the one is distinct from the other, <HI>Joh. 5.17.</HI> And lastly, The incomprehensible glory of the Father most brightly shi∣neth forth in the Son, <HI>Joh. 17.5.</HI> And <HI>He is the express image of his per∣son,</HI> that is, as no one thing can be more like another, than the picture or image on the thing stamped, as to the Seal or Instrument wherewith it was stamped, the one carrying the very form of the other; so Christ is the <HI>express image</HI> of the Person of the Father: First, As he is the second Person in the Sacred Trinity; the whole Divine Essence, and all the Divine Properties being communicated to him. <HI>2.</HI> As he is <HI>Immanuel,</HI> God with us, his Humane Na∣ture being hypostatically united to the Divine Nature; and so he is visibly the Character or express Image of God. For in Christ incarnate, the Divine Pro∣perties
<PB N="362" REF="189"/> are most conspicuous, as, <HI>Almighty Power, Infinite Wisdom, Truth, Justice, Mercy,</HI> and the like. In Christ as <HI>God-man,</HI> dwelt <HI>all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,</HI> Col. <HI>2.9.</HI> And in this respect Christ saith of him∣self, <HI>Joh. 14.9. He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father also.</HI> As he that seeth the <HI>Character</HI> or <HI>Figure</HI> which is on the thing stamped, sees therein the figure that is on the Seal wherewith it was stamped. <HI>5.</HI> He <HI>up∣holds, preserves,</HI> orders, and governs all things made, by the word of his power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ut Reges verbo suo &amp; mandato subdit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s facilè gubernant; ita filius Dei sine ulla difficultate, omnipo∣tente suâ providentiâ ac voluntate, quasi verbo solo mundum sustinet, &amp; regit</NOTE>, that is, by his powerful Providence.

'Tis true, only the <HI>Humane Na∣ture</HI> of Christ was offered up, <HI>1 Pet. 3.18.</HI> and <HI>1 Pet. 4.1.</HI> yet by reason of the hypostatical union of his two Natures in one Person, He is said to <HI>give himself,</HI> Eph. <HI>5.2.</HI> and <HI>to offer up himself,</HI> Heb. <HI>7.27.</HI> and <HI>to sacrifice himself,</HI> Heb. <HI>9.26. 7.</HI> Having by his death offered up a suf∣ficient Sacrifice for the expiation of our sins, he rose from the dead, and ascend∣ed into Heaven, and sate down on the right hand of the Throne of the Ma∣jesty on high, there to continue an High-Priest for ever to make intercession for us: so that he was so far from being vanquish'd and swallowed up by his suf∣ferings for our sins, as thereby way was made for his entrance into the highest degree of glory and dignity that could be attained unto. <HI>8.</HI> The Apostle shews, That Christ is above <HI>Angels,</HI> having a more excellent name than they, by how much the name <HI>Son</HI> is more excellent than the name <HI>Angel</HI> or <HI>Messenger.</HI> And the <HI>name of the Son of God</HI> is by inheritance due to Him, being ac∣cording to his <HI>Divine Nature</HI> the Son of God by eternal generation; and as <HI>Man,</HI> being God's Son, because by assumption of the Humane Nature into per∣sonal union with the Godhead, he is made so to be, <HI>Luke 1.35.</HI> So that the same person who was the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and to be incarnate, is now the Son of God in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnated. Further, they might consider, that Christ's <HI>Divine</HI> nature is infinitely more excellent than the Angelical: yea, his <HI>Humane</HI> nature, by vertue of its hypostatical union with the Divine, hath likewise a dignity transcendently surpassing the Angelical nature; Christ having, as <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and man a more eminent Function than belongs to any Angel. This last argument the Ap stle confirms with eight reasons in this Chapter, whereof the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven first are taken out of so many places of Scripture; <HI>1.</HI> From <HI>Psal. 2.7.</HI> where God the Father speaking of his Son's incarnation (which was first wrought <HI>in</HI> and <HI>by</HI> his conception, and then manifested to the world by his birth), <HI>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</HI> that is, de∣clared thee to the world to be my only begotten Son. As if God the Father had thus said to the Son: <HI>Thou, and thou alone, art truly and properly my Son, not by grace or adoption, but by nature and eternal genera∣tion; and now I do in this last age of the world declare thee so to be, by thine Incarnation, Doctrine, Works, Resurrection from the dead, and Ascension into Heaven; whereby it manifestly appears, that thou, infi∣nitely surpassest all the Angels in Heaven. 2.</HI> From <HI>2</HI> Sam. <HI>7.14.

<PB N="366" REF="191"/> dye? he answers, That Christ, who sanctifies us by his holy Spirit, took our humane nature upon him (a humane soul and body) and so became of one nature with us, for which cause he is not asham'd to call and acknowledg <HI>his sanctified ones</HI> for his brethren, as he proves from <HI>Psal. 22.22;</HI> where, though in the <HI>first sense</HI> the words may be understood of <HI>David,</HI> who pro∣fesses that he will declare the <HI>Name,</HI> that is, the <HI>Attributes</HI> and <HI>Counsels</HI> of God in the midst of the Israelites, his brethren [see <HI>Deut. 17.20.</HI>]; yet in a <HI>sublimer sense</HI> they ought to be understood of Christ, who declared the <HI>Name,</HI> that is, <HI>whatsoever is meet to be known of God,</HI> viz. his Di∣vine Excellencies, Counsels, and Actions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Joh. 8.26.28.

Now that which was <HI>historically</HI> true of <HI>Isaiah</HI> and his children, the Apostle shews may be fitly applied to Christ. The Prophet and his Children were a type of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of the <HI>faithful</HI> which believe in him (whom God hath of his free-grace given unto him, to be fitted and brought to glory) who are <HI>his children,</HI> begotten to him by his Spirit in the Ministry of his Gospel; whom (by way of reioycing for the good success of his Ministry) he presents with himself unto his Father, as one who faith∣fully fulfilled the charge committed to him, in fitting them for glory, and bringing them to it, though in the world they were accounted <HI>Wonders</HI> and <HI>Monsters.</HI> The Apostle further shews, That Christ, out of love to his Chil∣dren, would partake of the same humane nature with them, that he might by his own death on the Cross satisfie the Justice of God for them, and so eva∣cuate and destroy the power of the Devil, which he, <HI>as an Executioner,</HI> hath by the Law against sinners. And another end of his death, was, That he might deliver his Children from the fear of death (both temporal and eternal), to the bondage of which they were before subject. And being to suffer death for those ends, certain it is, that he took not on him the na∣ture of Angels, but the humane nature, and was of the very substance of man, and was born of the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> to whom the promise that the <HI>Messiah</HI> should come of his seed, was often made <HI>[Gen. 12.3.</HI> and <HI>18.18.</HI> and <HI>22.18.].</HI> Wherefore it became him in all things to be like his brethren, sin only excepted <HI>[Heb. 4.15.],</HI> that he might be a compassionate High-Priest, and faithful in all that he was to transact and negotiate with God on the behalf of man, and that he might make atonement and reconciliation for sinners by the Sacrifice of Himself.

He was as faithful in his message for the changing the <HI>Levitical Ordinances</HI> and <HI>Priesthood,</HI> as <HI>Moses</HI> was in appointing them. <HI>2.</HI> He shews, that <HI>Christ</HI> was much to be preferr'd before <HI>Moses,</HI> though <HI>Moses,</HI> compar'd with other men, was a person very extraordinary.

And they should remember, that some of the <HI>an∣cient Israelites,</HI> when they had heard and received the Law from Heaven, and had heard God promising blessings to them that obeyed him, and threatning curses to the disobedient, did notwithstanding rebel, and fall off, and mur∣mur against him.

<P>The Apostle comes now to assert the <HI>Priesthood</HI> of Christ, and from thence he encourages the <HI>believing-Hebrews</HI> to <HI>perseverance</HI> and <HI>stedfastness</HI> in the profession of the faith. And <HI>(1.)</HI> he shews, That seeing we have a great <HI>High-Priest,</HI> whose word is lively and mighty in operation, and before whose eyes all things are naked, and who hath passed through these visible Hea∣vens, and gloriously ascended unto the right hand of the Father in the highest Heaven; therefore they should be sure to hold fast their profession of faith in Him. And this their <HI>High-Priest,</HI> he tells them, is a merciful and compas∣sionate High-Priest, who having sometimes felt those infirmities in his flesh which we feel, and been exercis'd with such temptations as we are liable to (yet so as they never drew him to sin), we have good cause to believe, that he will be merciful to us, and ready to relieve us when we are tempted. Therefore let us come boldly, in the name of this our High-Priest, to the Throne of Grace, for the obtaining all seasonable grace and assistance that we need in our passage towards Heaven. <HI>From Ver. 14, to the end.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 5.</NOTE>The Apostle goes on to set forth the excellency of Christ's <HI>Priestly Office,</HI> shewing him to be more excellent than any <HI>typical Priest,</HI> in all Priestly re∣quisites, yea than <HI>Aaron</HI> himself; therefore the believing-Hebrews had rea∣son to moderate their thoughts touching the <HI>Levitical Priesthood,</HI> which they were apt too highly to esteem, to the prejudice of Christ. And in the first place he considers the chief things observable in the Aaronical High-Priest, and applies them unto Christ. First, The <HI>Aaronical High-Priest</HI> being taken from among men, and severed and set apart from the common multitude, was appointed to act and negotiate for the good of men, in the things wherein they have to do with God; particularly, to offer <HI>gifts, oblations,</HI> and <HI>sacri∣fices</HI> for their sins. <HI>2.</HI> He was to execute this his Office with pity and compassion<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is to have so much com∣passion as is sufficient.</NOTE> to the ignorant, and those that are out of the way, being him∣self compassed with infirmities. <HI>3.</HI> He was to offer for his own sins as well as for the people's. <HI>4.</HI> He must be called of God, as was <HI>Aaron.</HI> No man could legally<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The prin∣cipal honour of the High-Priest was, That he was a kind of a Mediator be∣tween God and man.</NOTE> assume this honour to himself, but he that was of <HI>Aaron</HI>'s line, and so called to it by God, who assign'd that high dignity to that line
<PB N="371" REF="193"/> only. Now the Apostle shews, that all these may well be applied to Christ. And first, he instances in the <HI>last</HI> of them, That Christ did not intrude him∣self upon this Office, nor assumed the honour and glory of it to himself, but the Father glorified him by ordaining him thereunto. And this he proves from two places in the <HI>Psalms: 1.</HI> Out of <HI>Psal. 2,</HI> where God the Father says to him, <HI>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;</HI> that is, in this day of thy resurrection I have bestowed this special dignity upon thee, to be a <HI>King</HI> and <HI>High-Priest;</HI> and thou shalt ascend into Heaven, as the High-Priest did into the Holy of Holies; and then he commands him, <HI>to ask of him the ends of the earth,</HI> or to intercede for the salvation of many, which is a special part of his Priestly Function. His second proof is out of <HI>Psal. 110,</HI> where God's deputing Christ to that Function is declared. For 'tis God the Father that saith, <HI>Thou art such a Priest as Melchisedec</HI> was; that is, a <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Priest together;</HI> and thy Priesthood shall never cease, or be suc∣ceeded by any, till this <HI>Mediatory</HI> Kingdom of thine shall be delivered up to me, See <HI>2 Cor. 15.24.</HI> The Apostle having thus proved that Christ was called to be a <HI>Priest,</HI> he proceeds to shew, that the other things which belonged to the High-Priest, belonged unto him. For, <HI>2.</HI> He was a Son of man, of the same nature and<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">He assumed our Humane na∣ture, being like to us in infirmi∣ties that were not sinful.</NOTE> mould with us. <HI>3.</HI> He offered a sacrifice for the sins of the people (but not for his own, for he had none), and that sacrifice was, <HI>Himself on the Cross. 4.</HI> He was a merciful High-Priest, having had experience of our miseries. For in the state of his humiliation, when he was here in the flesh<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>In the days of his flesh] i. e.</HI> his mortal and weak flesh, compassed with infirmities, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.14 In Hea∣ven he hath flesh still, but immor∣tal, and void of these natural weak∣nesses.</NOTE>, in his agony in the Garden, and on the Cross, feeling the weight of God's wrath lying on him for our sins, he offered up <HI>ardent prayers</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Supplicatio Christi ex intimo cordis dolore profecta, duplex enar∣ratur: <HI>Ʋna</HI> in horto cum dixit, <HI>Pater, si fieri potest, tollatur a me ca∣lix iste:</HI> quam precationem suppli∣cem non solum proposuit semel, sed etiam <HI>majori contentione</HI> (&amp;, ut vide∣tur, non sine clamore) ter repetiit, Luc. 22.42, 44.

And though he were the <HI>beloved Son of God,</HI> and so more excellent than any High-Priest, yea, than any Creature; yet by his grievous sufferings he was inured to submit to his Father's will; and experimentally knew what <HI>Obedience</HI> meant, and how hard a lesson <HI>Patience</HI> under the Cross is (which is the highest and chiefest point of a Christian's obedience); and thereby he became more fit to compassionate us. Yet it is not to be won∣dred at, that so excellent a Person, and so dear to God, should suffer as he did: for by his sufferings he was made a full and perfect Redeemer <HI>Heb. 7.26.],</HI> so that nothing more need be added unto what he has done and suffered for the redemption of man.

So that from the whole discourse he infers, that Christ must needs be a <HI>Priest</HI> of a more <HI>excellent Order</HI> than was <HI>Aaron</HI>'s (which was an exspiring Order, and not to last for ever), and that he was called and openly declared of God, <HI>viz.</HI> in that <HI>110 Psalm,</HI> to be an <HI>High-Priest</HI> after the order of <HI>Melchizedec.

Ano∣ther sacrifice therefore must be offered up, if <HI>such</HI> be redeemed. The Apostle also further sets out the woful estate of <HI>Apostates,</HI> and the equity of God's proceeding against them, by an elegant comparison. As the <HI>fertile ground</HI> (saith he), which, drinking in the rain that comes often upon it, brings forth a plentiful encrease, to the joy and comfort of the Husbandman, does thereby testifie that it is blessed of God [see <HI>Gen. 27.27.</HI>]; but the <HI>barren earth</HI> (which after tillage and irrigation bears nothing but thorns and briars) is given over abandoned and disregarded by the <HI>Owner;</HI> and if it so continue, may expect ere long to be cursed by him (as the fruitless fig-tree was. <HI>Mat. 21.19.</HI>), and finally doom'd fit for nothing but to be burnt and destroyed, like the Land of <HI>Sodom.</HI> So they who after illumination and the means of grace afforded to them, do advance in Christianity, in Faith and Holiness, and go on towards perfection, do thereby declare themselves to be blessed of God; but such as do not make a right use of the means and helps God af∣fords them; but instead of making progress in Christianity, do fall off from Christ and their Christian Profession, they shew themselves to be in a cursed and miserable condition.</P>

For this <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> in his <HI>Name</HI> [King of Righteousness], and in his <HI>Title</HI> [King of <HI>Salem</HI> or Peace] was a <HI>Type</HI> of Christ; and be∣ing stiled, <HI>Gen. 14.18, a Priest of the Most High God,</HI> it appears he was both <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Priest.</HI> And accordingly when <HI>Abraham</HI> returned from his victory over <HI>Kederlaomer,</HI> and the other neighbouring <HI>Reguli</HI> or Kings, he came out and treated him and his Army royally, like a <HI>King, bringing forth bread and wine</HI> for them; and as a <HI>Priest</HI> blessed him, and received from him the tenth of <HI>all he had there.</HI> He further shews, how this <HI>Melchizedec</HI> (that he might more clearly represent Christ) stands in the History recorded of him in <HI>Genesis,</HI> as a <HI>Priest;</HI> of whose Father, and Mother, and Pedigree, there is no mention; neither of his birth or death, or that he had any successor in his Priest∣hood<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">The History which declares him to be a Priest, maketh no men∣tion either of the beginning of his Priesthood, or of the ending thereof.</NOTE>. In all which particulars he was a <HI>type</HI> of Christ (and so represented <HI>Psal. 110</HI>) who is such a Priest as he, in respect of the conjunction of the <HI>Regal</HI> Office, and <HI>Sacerdotal;</HI> in respect of his being King of Righ∣teousness, and Prince of Peace; in respect of his being without Father, <HI>as He is Man;</HI> and without Mother, <HI>as he is God;</HI> and so He is without descent and genealogy; without be∣ginning of days, or end of life; and continueth for ever in that Office, that is, so long as there shall be any need of his mediation. So that <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> though he were a true <HI>Man,</HI> yet in his singular Prerogatives he was made like unto the <HI>Son of God;</HI> and was so set forth, as to hear a resemblance of Him, being appointed by God a visible Type of Him before He was exhibited in the flesh.</P>
<P>The Apostle having set forth <HI>Melchizedec</HI>'s excellency in himself, proceed∣eth to amplifie the same in reference to others. And first, sheweth how he ought to be preferred before <HI>Abraham,</HI> and before all the <HI>Levites</HI> that de∣scended from <HI>Abraham.</HI> For that act of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s in giving a <HI>tenth</HI> to <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> implieth an inferiority in himself who paid them, and a supe∣riority in him that received them; because the <HI>Tenth</HI> was an holy tribute due to God, and so it was paid by <HI>Abraham,</HI> who paid it to <HI>Melchizedec</HI> as to God's Priest, standing in God's room, and in that respect greater than himself. 'Tis true, he shews that the Levitical Priests had commission by the Law to receive Tythes of all Jews that defended from <HI>Abraham,</HI> and there∣in were counted greater than their Brethren. But <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> who was no kin to <HI>Abraham</HI> (nor of that people), but a stranger to him, received Tythes, not from the Progeny of <HI>Abraham,</HI> but from <HI>Abraham</HI> himself; which is a greater dignity than to receive them only from his own people. <HI>2.</HI> The Apo∣stle shews, that to bless <HI>authoritatively,</HI> is an act of superiority; now <HI>Mel∣chizedec</HI> blessed <HI>Abraham,</HI> who was so special a <HI>Favourite</HI> of God, and re∣ceived such excellent promises from him, and had them so often repeated to him. And certainly, he that <HI>blesseth one authoritatively,</HI> is greater than <HI>he</HI> whom he blesseth. Therefore Christ (whose Type and Shadow <HI>Melchize∣dec</HI> was) is much more excellent than <HI>Abraham,</HI> and than all the Leviti∣cal Priests which sprang from him. Further, to prove the excellency of <HI>Mel∣chizedec</HI>'s Priesthood above the <HI>Levites,</HI> he tells them, in <HI>v. 8,</HI> That <HI>here,</HI> that is, in the <HI>Levitical</HI> Priesthood, though those Priests be superior to the

On the same ground it may well be inferr'd, that all <HI>Adam</HI>'s posterity did eat of the forbidden fruit in him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12.

And therefore his Priesthood far excelleth <HI>Aaron</HI>'s, which several of the <HI>Jews</HI> had in so high esteem; and so much rested on it, that they little regarded Christ's. This he proves by several particulars. <HI>1.</HI> If a perfect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Heb. 9.9. and 10.1.</NOTE> expiation of sin, and furnishing men with all they have need of to eternal life, could have been had by the <HI>Levitical</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg"><P><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: populus enim ad illud lege ad∣strictus. <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er</HI> in loc.</P>

Therefore the changeable Levitical Priesthood is not so excel∣lent as the unchangeable Melchizedechian Priesthood of Christ. Now that the Priesthood was changed, he evidenceth by the translation of it to another tribe: Christ our High-Priest (of whom these things are said) springing from the Tribe of <HI>Judah;</HI> whereas God had restrained the Priesthood under the Law, to the Tribe of <HI>Levi:</HI> For by <HI>Moses</HI>'s speaking nothing that the Priesthood should be executed by any other Tribe, it appears that it was not God's mind that any that were of any other Tribe should be of the Priesthood, or attend upon the Altar. <HI>From Ver. 11, to the 15.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He gives a further proof of the change of the Priesthood, from the dif∣ferent manner of Consecration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vid. Parae∣um in loc.</NOTE>. For Christ our High-Priest (who is raised up after the similitude of <HI>Melchizedec</HI>) was not made a Priest with such <HI>carnal rites</HI> and outward solemnities as the Law prescribed to be used at the Consecration of <HI>Aaron</HI> and his sons in their several successions; but he was made a Priest <HI>with the power of endless life,</HI> consecrated a Priest that should ever continue, and ever live to make intercession for us, and apply unto us the vertue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his sacrifice, for the bringing us to everlasting life, according as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> testifies in the fore-cited <HI>Psalm,</HI> where God the Father saith to his Son, <HI>Thou art a Priest for ever after the Order of Melchizedec.

<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> He shews a reason why the <HI>Legal Covenant,</HI> with the Ceremonial Precepts, and Levitical Priesthood belonging thereto, was changed, because of the <HI>weakness</HI> and <HI>unprofitableness</HI> of it (in it self considered) for the ex∣piation of sin; therefore there was a necessity to introduce the Eternal Priest∣hood of Christ.

<PB N="380" REF="197"/> but <HI>Himself,</HI> in sacrifice, and that but <HI>once,</HI> upon the Cross; which <HI>once-offered-Sacrifice</HI> was abundantly sufficient for the expiation of sin. Moreover, the <HI>Levitical</HI> Law appoints men to be High-Priests that laboured with infir∣mities, and were sinners, and subject to mortality; but the promise made to Christ (and confirmed by God's Oath, and declared by <HI>David, Psal. 110,</HI> some hundreds of years after the Law was given) maketh the <HI>Son,</HI> and none but the <HI>Son</HI> (who is perfectly holy, and consecrated to this everlasting Office) a <HI>Priest for evermore.</HI> From <HI>Ver. 26, to the end.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 8.</NOTE>The Apostle having proved the excellency of Christ's Priesthood in the for∣mer Chapter, he now proceeds to shew his <HI>faithful execution thereof,</HI> for the good and salvation of his Church, from the beginning of this Chapter to the <HI>19 v.</HI> of <HI>ch. 10.</HI> In this Chapter he proves, That <HI>His Ministry</HI> is far to be preferr'd be∣fore the <HI>Levitical,</HI> by four Arguments. <HI>1.</HI> From the <HI>Magnificence</HI> of it, <HI>v. 1. 2.</HI> From the <HI>Place</HI> where he ministers, <HI>viz.</HI> Heaven, <HI>v. 2. 3.</HI> From the <HI>Sa∣crifice</HI> which he presents, <HI>viz.</HI> his <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Humanity</HI> wherein he suffered, <HI>v. 3, 4, 5. 4.</HI> From the <HI>Covenant</HI> whereof he is Mediator, from <HI>v. 5,</HI> to the end.</P>
<P>In the first place, to excite their attention, he tells them, That this is the <HI>sum</HI> of the things he had before spoken concerning Christ's Priesthood, <HI>viz. 1.</HI> That the <HI>High-Priest,</HI> who intercedes for us Christians, is one that is en∣tred into Heaven, and there sits at the right hand of God, and hath all power given unto him both in heaven and earth. <HI>2.</HI> He is a Mini∣ster of the <HI>Sanctuary of Heaven</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sanctuary, or the most holy place, is here metaphorically put for Heaven, which it represented.</NOTE>.

The faithful therefore under the Old Testament, were not perfected (as pertaining to the Conscience) by the legal rites they performed, but by the Evangelical and Cele∣stial Truths, which those Rites typified; and so they were perfected as we Christians now are, though not so clearly and mani∣festly. And the Apostle shews a reason why those legal rites could not make perfect; namely, Because the nature of them was such, that they reached only to the <HI>outward man,</HI> they consisting, for the most part, in meats and drinks, and divers washings and ordinances that concern the flesh or body of man, which did not (separate from their signification, as many <HI>Jews</HI> took them) commend any man to God <HI>[1 Cor. 8.8.],</HI> and were impos'd upon them as a <HI>yoke [Acts 15.19.],</HI> until the times of the New Testament should come, in which these Ceremonies should be removed, and other more spiritual Institu∣tions introduced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The people of the Jews being a gross people, and much addicted to Idolatry, it seemed good to the wisdom of God to exercise them with a gross and bodily worship, that so he might keep them from Idolatry.</NOTE>, wherein the Holy Ghost would work more powerfully. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 11.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 10.</NOTE>In this Chapter the Apostle proceeds to shew the <HI>weakness</HI> and <HI>imperfe∣ction</HI> of the <HI>Levitical Sacrifices</HI> (considered in themselves, and separate from what they typified), and the <HI>power</HI> and <HI>efficacy</HI> of Christ's <HI>Sacrifice.

<P>The <HI>weakness</HI> of the <HI>Levitical</HI> Sacrifices he proves by four Arguments. First, From the nature of the things injoin'd by the <HI>Ceremonial Law,</HI> which were only <HI>types, shadows,</HI> and darker draughts and delineaments (as it were) of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>heavenly good things</HI> which were to be purchased and imparted by Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist. So that the <HI>Levitical Ordinances</HI> did not present the things thems<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves in their full proportion, lively image and shape, as the Gospel does. <HI>2.</HI> Those <HI>Sacrifices</HI> which were often repeated year by year, could not (of themselves) make a satisfaction for sin, or <HI>justifie,</HI> or <HI>purge</HI> from the guilt and power of it, those who came to worship God by them. For if they could, they would have ceased to be offered; whereas the frequent re∣iteration and repeating of them, argued their weakness and imperfection. Could they once have taken away sin, or purged the Conscience from the guilt of it, there would have been no need to repeat them, seeing the worshippers once purged and cleared of the guilt of their sins by <HI>one</HI> of those Oblations and Sacrifices, would have been quieted in their Consciences, and not had them accusing and condemning them for them. But the case was far otherwise.

<P>Having thus shewed the <HI>weakness</HI> of the <HI>Levitical</HI> Sacrifices, he comes now to shew the <HI>power</HI> and <HI>efficacy</HI> of Christ's Sacrifice; and that he proves from <HI>Psal. 40. v. 6, 7, 8.</HI> where Christ is brought in as newly come into the world; and made <HI>Man,</HI> speaking to his Father after this manner: <HI>Foras∣much as thou didst formerly appoint Sacrifices as types to prefigure the Sacrifice of thy Son, but didst not intend they should continue longer than till He mould be offered up. Thou delightest therefore in those Sacrifices now no longer; but hast sent me into the world, and pre∣pared me a body, or humane nature (holy, harmless, and free from sin, that it may be fit to be join'd with my Deity) that therein I might offer up my self a true Propitiatory Sacrifice for the sins of men.</HI>

And 'tis plain, that God was never pleas'd with the <HI>Levitical</HI> Sacrifices for their own sake, but only as they signified the death of his Son, Therefore in the fulness of time (when God saw it fit) Christ came into the world to do <HI>that</HI> which the <HI>Levitical</HI> Sacrifices did only prefigure, but could not effectuate. And when that time was come, Christ did assume our nature, and offered himself willingly unto the Father, declaring himself ready to perform his will<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">When God had professed that he took pleasure no longer in <HI>Levitical</HI> Sacrifices, then cometh Christ with an Offering or Sacrifice of his own Body.</NOTE>, and to be obedient unto him, even to the death of the Cross, for the redemption of sinners, as it was fore-prophesied of him in the Sacred Scripture, or Volume of the Law, <HI>Gen. 3.15.</HI> The <HI>Le∣vitical Sacrifices</HI> therefore being removed and taken away, as being <HI>insufficient</HI> to make expiation of sin, Christ's <HI>Sacrifice</HI> alone remaineth, as <HI>that only</HI> which pleaseth God, and is available to remove sin.

Again, there was this difference between the <HI>Levitical</HI> Priests, and Christ: They were <HI>many,</HI> and ministred as Servants, repeating daily and frequently the same sacrifices (for kind) which God had enjoin'd; none of which had power, of themselves, to free the Conscience from guilt, or the offendor from the punishment due to sin. But Christ did not always stand ministring and offering sacrifices, as they did; but having once offered up himself on the Cross (which one Sacrifice sufficeth for sin for ever), he ceased and offered no more, but ascended into heaven, and there sitteth at the right hand of his Father, and there continueth to execute his <HI>Kingly</HI> and <HI>Priestly Office,</HI> till all the enemies of our salvation, and at last Death it self, shall be vanquished; and then He shall lay down this form of governing, and with the Father and the Holy Ghost be <HI>all in all</HI> for ever; see <HI>1 Cor. 15.24,</HI> &amp;c. And he shews, it needs not be wondred at, that Christ hath now no more offerings to make, nor sufferings to endure; for by that <HI>one offering</HI> of himself, he hath made a perfect satisfaction to the Justice of God, and a full purchase of all things<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Heb. 7.25.</NOTE> that were requisite and needful, to bring those to eternal life who are <HI>sanctified</HI> by his grace, and brought to believe in him with a lively faith. He hath not left any other Offering to be made for them, after His. And he further proves the absolate perfection of Christ's Sacrifice, by the testimony of the Holy Ghost, recorded <HI>Jer. 31.31.</HI> where af∣ter God bad promised a <HI>new Covenant</HI> instead of the <HI>old,</HI> and had said, <HI>This is the Covenant I will make with them after those days (viz.</HI> when the days of the Old Testament are exspir'd); then He says, <HI>I will put my Law into their hearts, and their sins and iniquities I will re∣member no more.</HI> Now seeing God promiseth under the <HI>new</HI> Covenant, <HI>sanctification</HI> and <HI>remission of sins</HI> to all true believers (of which Cove∣nant Christ is the Mediator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Chap. 8.6.

<PB N="386" REF="201"/> sins be obtained by Christ's <HI>one</HI> Sacrifice, there needs no repetition of it, nor any other offering for sin. <HI>From Ver. 5, to 19.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto the Apostle hath <HI>doctrinally</HI> inform'd the <HI>Christian-Hebrews,</HI> that the <HI>Gospel-Ministry</HI> under the New Testament (ordained by Jesus Christ, God-man, our great Prophet and High-Priest), far excelleth the <HI>Levi∣tical Ministry</HI> under the Old Testament. He comes now <HI>practically</HI> to exhort them to divers Christian duties, which by way of <HI>application</HI> he inferrs from his precedent Doctrine, especially from the <HI>Priesthood</HI> of Christ. And first, He exhorts them constantly to hold fast their profession of <HI>faith in Christ. 2.</HI> To be very careful that their conversation be correspondent to the Precepts of the Gospel. In his Exhortation, he useth some arguments taken from the <HI>Leviti∣cal Types;</HI> which he so lays down, that withal they may tend to raise the minds of the believing-Hebrews to consider the excellency of the things sig∣nified thereby. And, <HI>1.</HI> He shews them, That they having now <HI>free access unto God in Heaven,</HI> through the blood of Jesus, and not by the blood of beasts, nor through the <HI>old way,</HI> the veil of the Sanctuary, as the High-Priest was wont to enter into the Holy of Holies; but by a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>everlasting way</HI> (giving life and refreshment to them that walk in it) which Christ hath consecrated and prepared for them, through the sacrifice of his own Flesh and Humanity, which was a veil to cover and hide his Divinity. And see∣ing He is now the great <HI>High-Priest</HI> over the Church of God, invested with all authority and power, and having <HI>all</HI> in substance, which His Type prefi∣gured; therefore, <HI>(1.)</HI> They should draw near to Jesus with a sincere heart, and with fulness of faith, that so they might have their souls sprinkled with his blood, and delivered from the accusation of an evil condemning Consci∣ence (and so furnished with a good answer to all challenges), and <HI>their bo∣dies washed with pure water,</HI> that is, sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, which was signified by the legal washings. <HI>(2.)</HI> They should hold fast the pro∣fession of their faith or hope in Christ, without wavering or warping in time trial: for the promises which God hath made to those who constantly <HI>be∣lieve in, and adhere to his Son,</HI> shall certainly be performed. <HI>(3.)</HI> He ex∣horts them to maintain Christian communion, as an help to their stedfastness and perseverance in the faith; observing <HI>(e)</HI> one ano∣ther,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">V. 24. Observemus alii aliorum actus, ut, siqui languescant, eos ex∣citemus ad dilectionem, &amp; pia facta. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> and exciting and provoking one another to <HI>love</HI> and all good works; and to maintain this communion both <HI>publikely</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Deserere conventus</HI> est initium quoddam Defectionis Contra, in Ec∣clesiis Deus auget sua dona. <HI>Idem.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>privately;</HI> and the rather, because the <HI>day</HI><NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">Dies judicii Judaici, qui typus erat ultimi judicii.</NOTE> <HI>of vengeance</HI> on the obdurate Jews drew nigh. <HI>From Ver. 19, to 26.</HI></P>
<P>He further presseth his Exhortation to <HI>stedfastness in the faith,</HI> by divers arguments: <HI>1.</HI> From the fearful case of <HI>wilful Apostates,</HI> who after illu∣mination and profession of faith in Christ, make defection from him, and wil∣fully reject him and the benefit of his Sacrifice. For such persons, he tells them, there remains no other sacrifice for sin, nor other way of remission, nor any other means to help them; But, having <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>wilfully</HI> rejected Christ, and <HI>maliciously</HI> betaken themselves to the side of his Adversaries, there remains nothing for them but a dreadful expectation of the fiery in∣dignation of God, which shall devour all such enemies of His. He shews, that the Contemner of <HI>Moses</HI>'s Law (legally convicted under two or three wit∣nesses) was adjudged to <HI>capital punishment</HI> without mercy; therefore much sorer punishment is due to the Contemners of Christ, who tread under foot (as it were) the Son of God, counting him as a <HI>vile person,</HI> and as one that dyed as a Malefactor; and count the blood of the Covenant, by which
<PB N="387" REF="201"/> Christ was <HI>sanctified</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Filius Dei per sanguinem suum suit <HI>sanctificatus,</HI> h. e. Deo in sanctum victimam consecratus, ut ait Joh. 17.19. <HI>Pro iis ego me sanctifico, ut &amp; ipsi sanctificati siut in veritate.</HI> Gomar.</P>
<P>There is a sanctification by <HI>con∣secration,</HI> when any thing is devoted or dedicated unto God; and a san∣ctification by <HI>an inhabitation of the holy Spirit.</HI></P></NOTE> (that is, consecrated to God as a <HI>Sacred Victim</HI>) an unholy thing, and do <HI>despight to the Spirit of Grace,</HI> as if he were a <HI>lyar,</HI> who convinceth them of the Deity and Divine Power of Christ. He further shews, That God professeth himself an Avenger of all sin and injuries done to his people <HI>[Deut. 32.36. Psal. 135.14.];</HI> and much more will he shew himself an Avenger of so horrible a sin and injury against his Son. And 'tis a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, when, as an angry Judg, he taketh vengeance on his enemies. <HI>From Ver. 26, to 32.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He urgeth them to persevere; setting before them their former profes∣sion of the faith, and their sufferings for it, <HI>partly</HI> whilst they themselves were openly reproached and oppressed by the enemies of the Gospel; and <HI>partly,</HI> whilst they out of Christian sympathy join'd themselves as companions to those that were so used. And particularly, he acknowledges how they had shewed compassion to him in his bonds, in mourning for him, and relieving of him. He also takes notice, how they took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, moved thereto from their assurance of a better inheritance in Heaven. Having there∣fore endured so much, he advises them not to desist or shrink from a bold and couragious profession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">V. 35. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] ita hic ap∣pellat liberam Christi professionem, ut Marc. 8.32.

He further tells them, they have <HI>need of patience,</HI> that they may be enabled to do and suffer whatever Christ shall call them unto; that <HI>so persevering,</HI> they may attain the promised re∣ward. For 'tis but a little while ere He will come to take vengeance on the obdurate Jews. In the mean time he shews them, that (as the Prophet <HI>Habbakkuk</HI> advises, <HI>ch. 24.) the just must live by faith;</HI> but if any <HI>apo∣statize</HI> from their profession, God will abhor those persons. But he tells them, he hopes better things of them (see <HI>chap. 6. v. 9.</HI>), namely, that they are not of the number of those that will apostatize, but such as will persevere in the faith, to the saving of their souls. <HI>From Ver. 32, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He proceeds to press his former Exhortation to <HI>perseverance in the faith,</HI> <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="Chap."/> with divers arguments drawn from the <HI>nature, properties, effects,</HI> and <HI>ex∣cellency</HI> of Faith, and illustrated from the manifold experiences of the Saints of old.</P>

Thus God testified of <HI>Noah,</HI> That he was a <HI>just and upright man, and one that walked with him. Abraham</HI> also received this testimony, That he <HI>was the friend of God;</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> That he was <HI>a man after God's own heart. 3. Faith</HI> fully rests in what God hath revealed concerning his making <HI>the worlds</HI> (that is, all manner of Creatures, above and below, visible and invisible) <HI>out of nothing,</HI> (that is, out of no pre-existent
<PB N="388" REF="202"/> matter), by the word of his power. And if <HI>faith</HI> be assured of such an Almighty Power in God, whereby he made this excellent structure of the world; how can it doubt of His power and ability to perform any of his promises made to his people? <HI>Ver. 3.</HI></P>
<P>He now produces the examples of those ancient <HI>Worthies</HI> who gave emi∣nent proof of their <HI>faith.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> He shews, that <HI>Abel</HI> by faith offered a more excellent Sacrifice than <HI>Cain.</HI> For <HI>Abel</HI> not only offered of the best and fattest of his Flock, whilst <HI>Cain</HI> in probability offered only some slight fruits; but <HI>Abel</HI> in his offering looked to <HI>the seed of the woman which should tread upon the Serpent's head;</HI> that is, unto Christ, who by his death should destroy the Devil, <HI>Heb. 2.14.</HI> By which faith (applying to himself the righteousness of the Messias) he obtained a testimony from God, that he was righteous, <HI>Mat. 23.35.</HI> For nothing can make a sinner righteous before God, but the righteousness of Christ laid hold on by faith, <HI>2 Cor. 5.21.</HI> And God had respect unto <HI>A∣bel</HI>'s person, and to his offering; manifesting his accep∣tation of them, either by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Igne caelitus demisso, ut Levit. 9.24. <HI>Grot.</HI></P>

For such carnal rites and observances, as the distinction of meats<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">The observation of the distin∣ction of meats, cannot settle or esta∣blish the heart in true and solid peace; but the grace of God in Christ, is the true Cordial that can strengthen the heart; therefore he advises them to stick to <HI>that,</HI> and not to be carried away with other doctrines.</NOTE>, he shews hath nothing profited, as to <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>justification,</HI> those that have most busied themselves about them, and have walked most strictly in the observance of them.

For he tells thew, Such as they, watch and take care for the good of their souls, as those

<P>He entreats them to remember him in their prayers.

He sends them the good news, That <HI>Timothy</HI> was now set at liberty, and gone forth, as 'tis probable, to preach the Gospel; with whom (if he shortly return'd unto him) he hoped he should come to them, being very desirous to see them. And so with salutations to them all, but especially to their Church-governours, not only from himself, but from several Christians of <HI>Italy</HI> (who often visited him at <HI>Rome</HI> in his imprisonment); and wishing unto them an encrease of grace, and an abundant sense of the love and favour of God in Christ, he shuts up his Epistle. <HI>From Ver. 18, to the end.</HI></P>

But it may be some might obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, <HI>Are not Christians free?</HI> He answers, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y are; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t so, as they are obliged to carry themselves as those that are made free <HI>by Christ</HI> from the dominion of sin, but not from a due subjection to lawful Magistrates; and therefore must not use their Chri∣stian liberty as a cloak or covering to any wickedn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss or maliciousness whatso∣ever; but as the true servants of God, must make conscience of all duties re∣quired of them, both towards God and man. And that they may perform this▪ he enjoins them to despise no man, but to give that respect to all men which is due to them, according to the station wherein God hath set them; That they bear an especial love to those who are of the houshold of faith; and, That they fear God, and honour the King. <HI>From Ver. 13, to 18.</HI></P>
<P>In the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt place he exhorts <HI>servants</HI> to give subjection and obedience to their own <HI>Masters,</HI> fearing to give them any just occasion of offence; and that they carry themselves so, not only to those who are <HI>good</HI> and <HI>gentle,</HI> but to
<PB N="407" REF="211"/> those also who are <HI>austere</HI> and <HI>morose.</HI> For this is acceptable to God, if any man. upon account that he may please him, patiently suffers wrongs and in∣juries. But what great matter is it, says he, if men endure submissively those punishments which their own faults have justly brought upon them? But when they have done no <HI>ill,</HI> and are then abused and contumeliously used, if this be born patiently and humbly, this is that Christian vertue of meekness which God will certainly reward: and this, he tells them, is <HI>that</HI> which all Christians are called unto, and whereof Christ himself hath given us an eminent example to be imitated by us; who though he was perfectly <HI>innocent,</HI> yet he met with many bitter contumelies from men; but being reviled, he reviled not again; and when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y put him to death, he neither threaten'd nor menac'd; but, praying for his persecutors, committed himself and his cause to God, who judgeth righteously. And many excellent benefits accrue to us by his suffer∣ings. For, <HI>1.</HI> He bare the punishment of our sins in his <HI>human nature</HI> on the Cross, and so made expiation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f them. <HI>2.</HI> By his death he purchased ver∣tue for the sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying of sin in us, and for the quickning of us to the duties of holiness; thae we being dead unto sin, might live unto righteousness. And therefore Christian-servants should consider not so much <HI>what</HI> they suffer for Christ, as the <HI>benefits</HI> they receive by him. For though they may receive stripes and wounds unjustly from their Masters in their bodies; yet let them remember what healing<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sanati estis]</HI> h. e.

Lastly, He remembers them of the woful estate they were in b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore their conversion; wandring like <HI>straying sheep,</HI> in ignorance and sinful ways; but now by the powerful grace of Christ they were brought home to <HI>Him</HI> the good Shepherd, and to his Fold; who will take care for the salvation of their souls, though their bodies and outward man may oftentimes here meet with hard usage from their unjust Ma∣sters. <HI>From Ver. 18, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He now gives Precepts to <HI>Wives,</HI> directing them how they should carry <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Chap."/> themselves towards their <HI>Husbands,</HI> if it should so happen that they should be <HI>unbelievers.</HI> He enjoins thew to carry themselves with so winning a kindness and humility towards them, that if they be not converted to Christianity by the Gospel preached to them, they may by the sweet, obliging, and dutiful be∣haviour of their Wives (which they see the Christian Religion instructs them in) be without any further preaching wrought on, and converted to the faith; especially they seeing nothing but chastity and holiness, joined with the fear of God, and reverence towards themselves, shining in the conversation of their Wives. And for their Attire, he enjoyns they should not be too curious in a∣dorning their outward persons with plaited hair, gold chains, or gay clothes; but should especially take care of their hearts and spirits, that those be adorned with the graces of <HI>meekness</HI> and <HI>quietness</HI> (which ornaments will not wax old as the others do), and are in the sight of God hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf, of high value and esteem. For after this manner, he tells them, <HI>viz.</HI> with outward modest attire, and inward meekness, the holy women of ancient times (that were eminent for their piety and faith in God), did set out themselves, living in obedience to their own Husbands. He instances in <HI>Sarah,</HI> who eminently testified her obedience to <HI>Abraham</HI> her Husband, calling him by a title of <HI>honour,</HI> not of equality. To whom, he tells them, they will shew themselves to be like, as Children to a Mother, if they labour to discharge a good conscience in all the duties required of them; and if they be not by any fear, or terror, or oppo∣sition of their unbelieving Husbands, or any others, driven out of the way of their duty. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 7.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, he exhorts <HI>believing Husbands</HI> to dwell with their <HI>be∣lieving Wives</HI> as <HI>men of knowledg</HI> (and as such as are well acquainted with their duty), carrying themselves <HI>wisely</HI> and <HI>discreetly</HI> towards them, gi∣ving

<P>He comes now to exhort all Christians in general, to <HI>concord</HI> and unity of judgment and affection among themselves, to <HI>sympathy</HI> and a fellow-feeling of one anothers afflictions, to <HI>brotherly love,</HI> to <HI>mercifulness,</HI> to <HI>affability,</HI> to <HI>courtesie,</HI> to <HI>patience,</HI> not rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing, unto them that injure them; but contrariwise, blessing and praying for them, and wishing all good unto them. And he urges his exhortation with these reasons: <HI>1.</HI> Because Christians are called to the practise of these Vertues, especially Pa∣tience; that they may, by the exercise of them, attain the glorious inheri∣tance of everlasting bliss and happiness. <HI>2.</HI> Because to be patient, and peacea∣ble, and watchful over their tongues, is the best way to make their lives com∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtable. <HI>3.</HI> 'Tis the best way to have the watchful Providence of God over them for <HI>good,</HI> and to have their <HI>prayers heard;</HI> whereas the face of God is against them that do evil, and he sets himself as an enemy against them, according to <HI>Psal. 34.12, 13, 14, 15. 4.</HI> 'Tis the probablest way to scape trouble and harm from evil men, to shew themselves constant pursuers of that which is good. But if (as sometimes it will fall out) they do suffer for righ∣teousness sake, they should count this no other than a blessing; and therefore whatsoever danger they are threatned with by the power of their persecutors, they should not be afraid or disturbed at it, but should <HI>sanctifie the Lord</HI> in that dispensation towards them <HI>[Isa. 8.12, 13.],</HI> and should furnish them∣selves with such a clear knowledg of the truth of the Gospel, that when they are asked, they may be able to shew the grounds and reasons of the <HI>faith</HI> they profess, and consequently of the hope of eternal life wrought in them thereby; and that with <HI>meekness</HI> of spirit, and a holy fear of miscarrying in giving their testimony. Lastly, They should labour to get their Consciences cleared from all guilt, by faith in the blood of Christ, and so guided by the light of his word, that they that accuse them as <HI>Malefactors,</HI> may be con∣vinc'd that their lives are very honest and inoffensive, being ordered accor∣ding to Christ's doctrine and command. But if it please God to permit them to suffer for well-doing, they should remember, there is no matter of sorrow in <HI>that;</HI> but if a man, to avoid suffering, fall into sin, and then suffer for it, they should consider, that <HI>that</HI> will be a sad thing indeed, without any allay or matter of comfort to him.

And since <HI>Believers</HI> have a spiritual priviledg answering to the <HI>Ark,</HI> sealing their safety from the deluge of God's wrath, namely, <HI>their Baptism</HI> (by which we mean not the <HI>external</HI> part of it alone, which can only re∣move the filth of the body; but the <HI>internal,</HI> viz. the application of Christ's blood to the conscience, which thereupon comfortably answers and witness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for them before God, and answers all challenges to the contrary upon this ground, that <HI>our Surety</HI> is absolved from our debt which he took on himself, whereof his <HI>Resurrection</HI> is an evidence); therefore they have no reason to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int in doing their duty, or to fear in the midst of their sufferings.

Therefore Christ will judg not only these who shall be found alive at his coming, but the dead also. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 7.</HI></P>
<P>Another argument whereby he presses the study of holiness, is, because <HI>the end of all things was at hand;</HI> that is, the end of the <HI>Jewish State</HI> and <HI>Polity.</HI> For that great fatal destruction threatned to the obdurate <HI>Jews,</HI> and often mentioned by Christ and his Apostles, drew nigh; see <HI>Mat. 24. Jam. 5.3, 9.</HI> Therefore he exhorts them, <HI>1.</HI> To be sober, and moderate, and to be much in prayer with God; and to add to their prayers watchfulness, that <HI>that day</HI> do not surprize them unawares. <HI>2.</HI> He presseth them to exercise a <HI>fer∣vent love</HI> and charity one towards another, as the <HI>sum</HI> and chief of all the duties we owe to our Neighbour: For <HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Charity,</HI> he tells them, will cover a multitude of sins and failings among Christians <HI>[Prov. 10.12.],</HI> and will hide them from the knowledg of the prophane. <HI>3.</HI> They should be cheer∣fully hospitable to their poor brethren, without grudging or murmuring at the charge. <HI>4.</HI> They should endeavour rightly to employ their spiritual gifts for the good of others, which they had received according to their respective places in the Church, as counting themselves stewards of those various gifts bestowed on them through the free grace and favour of God. He instances in two, <HI>1. Preaching of the word;</HI> shewing, that he that teacheth and instructeth the people, ought to do it with that uprightness and reverence, as becomes one that is a steward or dispenser of the Oracles of God. <HI>2. Ministration to the poor;</HI> which office the Deacons were faithfully to discharge; and private Christians were also to exercise their liberality according to the ability God had given them; that in the right use of all these gifts, God might receive glory (both by the <HI>Steward</HI> and <HI>dispenser</HI> of them, and by those also who are <HI>profited</HI> by them) through Jesus Christ, in whose <HI>strength</HI> only these gifts are rightly employed <HI>[Joh. 15.5.],</HI> and through whose merits and me∣diation, the <HI>intention</HI> to glorifie God by them is accepted <HI>[Heb. 13.5.];</HI> to whom, as to God blessed for ever, all honour and dominion ought for ever to be ascribed. <HI>From Ver. 7, to 12.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, he exhorts them not to be troubled or amazed at the sharpest persecutions or hottest trials they should meet with for the sake of Christ. For considering that in <HI>that furnace</HI> their graces will be tried, and their corrup∣tions purged away, they should count it matter of joy to them, because hereby they are made partakers of the afflictions appointed for the members of Christ, and are made like unto him in suffering, and shall share with him in his glory, and have matter of incomparable exultation and joy at his second com∣ing. In the mean time, if they be reproached for the Name of Christ, and for their Christian profession, they should esteem it the happiest thing that could befall them. For the glorious <HI>Spirit</HI> of God delighteth with his comfortable and supporting-operations, to reside in the hearts of such as suffer for righ∣teousness sake; which blessed Spirit, though he be blasphemed by persecutors, yet he is glorified by those who boldly confess the truth, which he teacheth and imparts unto them. But he advises them by all means to be careful, that not any of them suffer as an <HI>evil-doer</HI> in any kind; but if he suffer for Christ's sake, or because he is a Christian, he shews that he ought to rejoyce in it, and to glorifie God, who hath made him <HI>willing,</HI> and hath enabled him to suffer in so good a cause, and hath thereby honoured him with a certain degree of Martyrdom. He tells them, the time is at hand when the Christians must expect great sufferings. <HI>Judgment</HI> will begin at the House and Family of God, for the correction and trial of his own children. And if God thus begin with his own children, who embrace the Gospel of his
<PB N="411" REF="213"/> Son, what a dreadful end<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">De Judaeis agit &amp; ejus gentis excidium praedicit: <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> pari sensu habes Mat. 24.14.

And if the <HI>righ∣teous</HI> in this life do smart for their sins, and meet with so many afflictions, that they cannot but with great difficulty (considering their own weakness) enter into the Kingdom of God. Surely the <HI>wicked,</HI> who give up themselves to work iniquity with greediness, shall be wonderfully punished, sometimes here in this life, but most certainly hereafter: neither shall they find any place to shelter themselves from the everlasting wrath of God. Therefore there is no reason why the <HI>godly,</HI> to shun sufferings from them, should join with them in their evil ways, seeing their <HI>end</HI> will be so terrible. From all which he inferrs, that those who <HI>suffer according to the will of God,</HI> should hold on in their duty, and commit the keeping of themselves to him, exercising faith on his <HI>Omnipotence,</HI> who created the World, and so is able to preserve them from the fury and rage of men, if he please; and on his <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> who will certainly perform all his promises to every faithful servant of his, and therefore will certainly preserve them, if it be best for them; and if he do not, he will make their very sufferings tend to the enhaunsement and encrease of their glory. <HI>From Ver. 12, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He now comes to exhort the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> the <HI>Pastors,</HI> and <HI>Spiritual Guides</HI> <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="Chap."/> of the Church, to discharge their duty faithfully in feeding the flock of God which was among them.

He presses them therefore to feed the Lord's people with his <HI>truth,</HI> and to rule them according to his <HI>discipline</HI> (both which may be comprehended in the word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>), and that they diligently attend the oversight of their flocks; not doing it by constraint, like <HI>Mercenaries;</HI> nor meerly for filthy lu∣cre's sake; but with a free and ready mind, designing faithfully to serve their Lord and Master, and to profit his people thereby; and further, that they should not impiously <HI>lord it over the Church</HI> (which is God's <HI>heritage</HI> and peculiar lot, chosen out of the common multitude for his own propriety), buc be ensamples to the flock in all holy walking; that when the <HI>chief Shepherd</HI> shall appear, they may receive an eminent degree of bliss, a never-fading Crown of Glory. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 5.</HI></P>
<P>He then points out the duties of the flock, whom he calls the <HI>younger,</HI> either because they were generally younger in years than their <HI>spiritual guides,</HI> or because they ought to shew that reverence and obedience to them which is suitable in <HI>young ones</HI> towards their <HI>elders.</HI> He exhorts those <HI>younger ones</HI> to submit themselves to the guidance of their <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> enjoining and commanding them things <HI>right</HI> and <HI>just</HI> in the name of God. Next, as <HI>fellow-members</HI> in the Church, he enjoins them <HI>mutual subjection</HI> one to another, in all duties of <HI>love,</HI> and particularly in receiving <HI>private admoni∣tions.</HI> And in order hereunto, he advises them to adorn themselves with <HI>hu∣mility,</HI> and a mean and low esteem of themselves. For, as <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, Prov. <HI>3.24,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Luk. 1.51, 52. Mat. 23.12. Luk. 14.11. and 18.14. Jam. 4.6.</NOTE> <HI>God opposeth himself against them that are high and haughty, and manifesteth his grace and favour to them that are humble.</HI> He advises them therefore to submit themselves with humility of mind to the guidance of God, and the directions of <HI>those</HI> he hath set over them, remem∣bring his Almighty Power, and how easily he can crush them, if they be <HI>dis∣obedient;</HI>
<PB N="412" REF="214"/> but if they be obedient, they should consider, that he is able to exalt them, and will certainly do it, either in this life (if he see it g <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for them), or at the day of judgment. And if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y walked in ways of obedi∣dience to him, they need not be disquieted at any difficulties that they may meet with; but should, with serenity of mind, cast <HI>all their cares</HI> on him; for they might assure themselves, he hath a peculiar care of them, and of what concerns them, that no hurt shall accrue unto them. <HI>From Ver. 5, to 8.</HI></P>
<P>He further exhorts them, to be <HI>sober,</HI> and <HI>vigilant,</HI> and <HI>stedfast,</HI> in ad∣hering to the truth, and the profession of the faith of Christ; and so to re∣sist the <HI>Devil</HI> and his <HI>temptations</HI> (who is our cruel and restless Enemy), especially <HI>those</HI> solliciting them to Apostacy by reason of their sufferings; re∣membring, they had all the rest of the Lord's people in the world for their <HI>fellow-soldiers</HI> in this warfare, who have their several shares of affliction to suffer, and their several measures of hardship to endure, as well as they. And therefore they should not expect a better condition in the world than the rest of their brethren. <HI>Ver. 8.9.</HI></P>
<P>In conclusion, He solemnly prays for these suffering-Christians▪ that God (who is the Author of all Grace, and is freely ready to communicate the same to all humble and penitent sinners; and who hath call'd them, by the Gospel, to the possession of his everlasting glory through the merits and mediation of his Son) would please, after they have suffered a little while here in this world, to per∣fect the work of grace he hath begun in them, to establish, and strengthen, and settle them in the <HI>truth,</HI> that their union with Christ <HI>the Foundation,</HI> might be made more firm and strong. To this infinitely gracious God he desires glory and dominion should be for ever ascribed. <HI>Ver. 10, 11.</HI></P>
<P>He tells them, he had writtten this short Epistle to them (by <HI>Silvanus,</HI> whom he took for a very faithful friend unto them), wherein he had exhorted them to their duty, and had born his testimony to the <HI>Gospel;</HI> assuring them, that <HI>that</HI> contains the <HI>true Doctrine of Salvation,</HI> and a true manifestation of God's grace to all penitent sinners who by faith lay hold on Christ: Which Doctrine, as they had been taught, they did hitherto profess, and stand fast in<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">V. 12. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> pro <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>; and they would do well to <HI>do so</HI> to the end. For 'tis a Doctrine that would deceive none that embrace it. He sends them salutations from the Christians at <HI>Babylon</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">The Church at <HI>Babylon</HI> seems to be made up of the posterity of those <HI>Jews</HI> who stayed there after the ex∣piration of the seventy years capti∣vity, whom this Apostle (being a Minister to the Circumcision) went to visit, having planted, as it seems, a Church there.</NOTE>, whom the Lord had chosen out of the world to be a Church to himself, and to share with others of his people in spiritual and eter∣nal mercies.

<P>THE Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> not long after this, seems to have re∣ceiv'd a revelation from the Lord of his approaching de∣parture out of this life; and therefore writes this his second Epistle to the dispersed <HI>Jews,</HI> intimating the same unto them, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.14.

And seeing the hazzard of negligence, and the advantage of diligence, was so great, therefore he tells them, he would not be negligent to stir them to their duty, and to mind them of these things, though many of them he apprehended were both discerning and solid Christians. And he judged it meet so to do, whilst he was in the tabernacle of this body, knowing that shortly he must end his life by a glorious Martyrdom, as Christ had told him, <HI>Joh. 21.18, 19.</HI> And this exhortation which he had written, would be pro∣fitable to mind them of their duty after his departure. <HI>From Ver. 3, to 16.</HI></P>
<P>He comes now to exhort them to constancy in the faith, and stedfastly to adhere to the doctrine taught by himself and the other Apostles. And to assure them of the truth and certainty thereof, he tells them, that himself and his
<PB N="415" REF="215"/> fellow-Apostles had not followed <HI>artificially-devised fables,</HI> when they made known and testified unto them the <HI>first coming</HI> of Christ in the flesh, and how by his <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Miracles</HI> he powerfully shewed▪ himself to be the true promised Messias.

And therefore they had need to labour after a clear understanding of those Scriptures, that they may not mistake about them. <HI>From Ver. 11, to 17.</HI></P>
<P>He comes now to the <HI>Conclusion</HI> of his Epistle; wherein he tells them, That seeing they were fore-warned of their danger, and acquainted how to prevent it, they should be more wary, lest they be drawn aside by the <HI>sedu∣ction</HI> of wicked men, from the way of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> wherein they had been in some measure established, and which they had hitherto professed. But on the contrary, they should labour daily to <HI>grow more and more in grace,</HI> and in a clear and distinct knowledg of our Lord and Saviour, and his Do∣ctrine. To this blessed Saviour he desires humbly and affectionately, that all honour and glory may be for ever ascribed. <HI>Amen. From Ver. 17, to the end.</HI></P>

<PB N="424" REF="220"/> is reserved as their just reward and punishment. He further shews that to <HI>these men</HI> the Prophecy of <HI>Enoch</HI> belongs, who at the beginning of the world (being the seventh from <HI>Adam</HI>), by the spirit of prophecy, foretold the sins of such persons, and their condemnation at the day of judgment, when Christ shall come in a glorious manner attended with Myriads of Saints and Angels to execute judgment upon all the ungodly, and especially upon such as have spo∣ken contumeliously against Himself and his holy Truth.

These <HI>mockers</HI> and <HI>scoffers,</HI> he shews, were <HI>such,</HI> as without any just cause or warrant, separated themselves from the communion and society of faithful Christians, and sought to draw others also into the like separation, pretending to be more holy, and spiritual, and perfect, than they; whereas in∣deed they themselves were meer <HI>Sensualists,</HI> such in whom <HI>sense</HI> and the <HI>flesh</HI> do reign with full vogue and sway, and have no∣thing of that <HI>enlightning, sanctifying, quickning, comforting-Spirit,</HI> which Christ communicates to his faithful ones. <HI>From Ver. 2, to 20.</HI></P>
<P>He comes now in the close of his Epistle to give them some hortatory Directions, by way of <HI>Antidote,</HI> against these <HI>Seducers,</HI> and their Se∣ductions.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> That they should labour to build up one another in holiness, being setled on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t holy and pure Doctrine of Faith (as on a firm foundation) which they had learned from the Apostles.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> They should be earnest in prayer unto God, That by his Divine Grace and Power he would strengthem them therein; labouring to pray by the as∣sistance of the Holy Ghost<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He pray∣eth <HI>in us,</HI> by exciting the gifts and graces he hath given us.

<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> That they should keep themselves continually in the exercise of <HI>love</HI> to God, labouring to encrease therein more and more; chearfully expecting and looking for that <HI>merciful</HI><NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="marg">V. 21. <HI>Mer∣cy]</HI> the Cause is put for the Effect.</NOTE> <HI>sentence</HI> of Christ at the Day of Judgment, whereby he will bestow eternal life on them.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> He gives them directions how to deal with those that are any way corrupted by these <HI>Seducers,</HI> viz. That they should deal with them af∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r a <HI>different manner,</HI> according as their particular condition required; such as were w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ak and simple, and had been easily seduced, he advises they should deal with them with great tenderness and compassion: But as for those who were
<PB N="425" REF="220"/> further intangled, and corrupted, and hardned in their errors by these <HI>Sedu∣cers;</HI> they should endeavour to <HI>save them with fear,</HI> that is, they should ter∣rifie them with the fear of God's judgments and wrath, if they went on in these ways; and by sharp admonitions, and a due and solemn use of Church-censures (as occasion required) snatch them, as it were, out of the fire which will destroy them if they continue in it. And thus they would shew and de∣clare their great detestation of holding any co-partnership or fellowship with them in their errors; and that they not only hated all impiety and wicked∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of life, but all erroneous Doctrines that might infect men, or draw them into it; as when a man would avoid the infection of the Pestilence, he will flye from, and not dare to touch any garment<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="marg">By the <HI>garment spot∣ted with the flesh,</HI> the Apostle intends that which seems to have any <HI>affinity</HI> or <HI>nearness</HI> to the vices of those sinners which were among them.

<P>He shuts up his Epistle, commending them to the Divine Grace of Christ, who is able to keep them from <HI>apostacy</HI> and <HI>falling away</HI> after the exam∣ple of these Seducers, and to cause to stand before his own most glorious Throne, <HI>such</HI> as shall be accounted blameless<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Eph. 5.27.</NOTE> in his sight, to their exceed∣ing great joy and triumph.

<P>AND now we can trace this great Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> no further by any light the Scripture hath left us. Some learned men indeed hold, that (the <HI>two years</HI> being ended in which he was detained in Military custody, and taught the Doctrine of Christ at <HI>Rome</HI>) he preached the Gospel up and down in <HI>Italy;</HI> and from thence went into <HI>Spain</HI> and the Western parts. And some hold, that he went into <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> where for five or six years he confirmed and established the Churches he had before planted in those Countreys, and then returned to <HI>Rome</HI> again; where, on the 29 of <HI>June,</HI> in the 13 year of <HI>Nero,</HI> he was beheaded. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> in his 26 <HI>Hom.</HI> on 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> says, The day of his death was more certainly known than that of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great.

Indeed he mentions in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> ch. 15.24, his desire and intent to go and preach in <HI>Spain.</HI> But it seems he saw cause to change his resolution. For it appears that when he wrote his Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> he intended very shortly (if <HI>Timothy</HI> came to him from <HI>Ephesus</HI>) to go for <HI>Judea,</HI> Heb. 13.23; yea, to go to <HI>Philippi</HI> [Phil. <HI>ch.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> 24.] and to <HI>Coloss</HI> [Philem. v. 22.]. Possibly the <HI>apostacy</HI> and <HI>wa∣vering</HI> he heard of in the <HI>Eastern Churches,</HI> caused him to think it more needful to go thither, than to go <HI>Westward.</HI> He expe∣cted indeed <HI>Timothy</HI> to come to him again to <HI>Rome;</HI> but whe∣ther they ever met and travelled together again, or what fur∣ther became of either of them, we cannot from any thing the Scripture hath left us, certainly determine.</P>

<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He comes now to the <HI>Body</HI> of the Epistle; wherein he exhorts them to the practice of holiness. He tells them, that this is the <HI>sum</HI> of the Gospel preached by Christ, which they his Apostles heard from him, and now testifie and publish, that <HI>God is light,</HI> that is, infinitely full of <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>pu∣rity;</HI> neither is there <HI>error, ignorance, falshood,</HI> or the least imaginable touch of impurity in him, neither can any impurity please him. Therefore whoever pretends to have communion with him (who is <HI>Light and Holiness</HI>), and yet walks in the <HI>dark</HI> ways of sin and impurity, he is a <HI>lyar,</HI> and deals not uprightly, but denies in his works what he professes with his mouth. For what communion can there be between <HI>light</HI> and <HI>darkness?</HI> But (says he) <HI>If we walk in the light,</HI> that is, in the clear knowledg and light of the Go∣spel, framing our lives and conversations according to the pure precepts there∣of, and conforming our selves to God, who is <HI>light</HI> and perfect purity, and <HI>dwells in light glorious and inaccessible [1</HI> Tim. <HI>6.16.],</HI> and whose acti∣ons are all holy and pure; then we shall have <HI>fellowship</HI> one with another, <HI>we</HI> with him, and <HI>He</HI> with us; and being by faith united unto Christ, his blood cleanseth us from the guilt of all our sins both original and actual. But if we shall say or imagine, that we are so free from sin, that we need not the <HI>blood</HI> of Christ, nor his <HI>intercession,</HI> for the purging our consciences from guilt, we miserably deceive our selves, and there is no true judgment or discerning of things in us, but we glory in that which is a meer <HI>lye</HI> and falshood. But if we penitently confess our sins, and by faith have recourse to the merits and intercession of Christ for the pardon of them, God is so <HI>faith∣ful,</HI> that he will forgive us all our sins, according to his own gracious promise; and he is also so <HI>just,</HI> that he will not exact the debt from those for whom his Son hath satisfied, but will for his sake forgive us all our unrighteousness. If we should say therefore, that we have not sinned, or have not made our
<PB N="437" REF="226"/> selves so guilty and so liable to eternal death, that we need such an expia∣tion as the death and passion of the Son of God, we should in effect give God the <HI>lye,</HI> and deny what he hath affirmed in his word, namely, That <HI>all men are sinners,</HI> and so need a Saviour; and thereby we shall shew, that the <HI>truth</HI> of God, as 'tis revealed in his word, is not received nor believed by us. <HI>From Ver. 5, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>Now lest any, from what he before said <HI>(of God's readiness to forgive <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Chap."/> sin to those who confess their sins, and fly to Christ for their pardon),</HI> should encourage themselves to sin freely and boldly; he tells them (giving them from the abundance of his love and paternal affection, and in respect of his age, the loving compellation of <HI>little children</HI>)<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Vox est blandissime monentis, quâ &amp; Christus ad discipulos suos usus est, Mar. 10. &amp; Joh. 13. &amp; Paulus ad Galatas cap. 4.

But if they have fallen, or shall fall through <HI>infirmity,</HI> or the <HI>violence of temptation,</HI> into any act of sin, then they should not despair, but consider (for their encouragement) that they have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ <HI>the righteous</HI> (whose perfect righte∣ousness renders him a fit and meet Intercessor for us, and who requires no∣thing of the Father in our behalf, but what is justly due to him upon the account of the merit of his death), and having offered up himself a Propitia∣tory Sacrifice for our sins on the Cross, his intercession now in Heaven must needs be of marvellous virtue. Nay, you may assure your selves, that his Sa∣crifice was of such infinite value and merit, that 'tis not only sufficient for the obtaining pardon for our sins who are <HI>Jews,</HI> but for the sins of the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> also, provided they repent and believe in him. <HI>Ver. 1, 2.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> He comes now to shew, That 'tis not enough for them to profess they <HI>know</HI> Christ, except they yeild sincere obedience unto him.

For he that boasts he knows him, and yet makes no consci∣ence to observe his commands, neither doth his knowledg work in him any en∣deavour to conform himself to Him in holiness and purity, that man is a <HI>great lyar,</HI> neither is there any truth or sincerity in him. But a conscientious en∣deavour to observe his <HI>word</HI> and <HI>commandments,</HI> is a great and sure argu∣ment, that <HI>in him that doth so,</HI> the <HI>love of God</HI> is grown to a high pitch, and a great evidence to himself that he is a <HI>true branch in Christ,</HI> and a true member of him.

He further presseth this duty from this reason, Because he that professeth himself to be <HI>in the light,</HI> and to know the truth, and yet hateth his brother, is in the darkness of ignorance and sin.

And whilst he thus walk∣eth in the light, he walketh inoffensively in a state of grace, and neither stumbleth himself, neither is there occasion given by him that others should stumble, or be drawn into any sin, or hardned in it. But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness; he goes on in sin, swerving from the right way that leads to salvation, and knoweth not whither he goes, nor how near he is to a precipice, and utter ruin, because his mind is dark∣ned with sin. He now directs his speech to those who were <HI>sincere Christi∣ans</HI> among them, and walked in the light (and to <HI>these,</HI> from his paternal affection, he gives the endearing-compellation of <HI>little Children</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">V. 12. <HI>Filioli]</HI> Nondum incipit distributio in certas aetates, quae con∣tinetur v. seq. sed ista appellatio cunctas aetates complectitur. <HI>Pisc.</HI></NOTE>), telling them, That he gave them these ex∣hortations to <HI>brotherly love,</HI> because God hath been so kind to them, as to forgive them all their sins for Christ's sake; and therefore they ought, upon that ac∣count, to be ready to forgive one another, and to love one another. <HI>From Ver. 7, to the 13.</HI></P>
<P>And now, says he, <HI>beloved Christians,</HI> suffer me to speak unto you as a <HI>Father</HI> doth to his Children, and distinguishing you according to your several ages, to address my exhortations and instructions particularly unto you. And <HI>first,</HI> Let me speak to you that are more advanced in age, and are, as it were, <HI>Fathers</HI> among the rest. 'Tis agreeable to <HI>your age</HI> to know <HI>ancient</HI> things; and seeing you have attain'd to a greater measure of knowledg than others, of <HI>the Ancient of days,</HI> the Eternal Son of God <HI>[Dan. 7.9, 13, 22.],</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Dat cui{que} ordini quae ipsi con∣veniunt. <HI>Senihus</HI> competit notiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp; congruum est ut <HI>Antiqui</HI> cognos∣cant <HI>Antiquum dierum.</HI> Estius.</NOTE> I think fit to exhort you to make a good improvement of it. Let it be an engage∣ment upon you to love him more ardently, and to imi∣tate him more carefully. <HI>2.</HI> Let me speak to you <HI>young men,</HI> who are in the flower of your age, and the vigour of your strength; 'Tis agreeable to your age to be <HI>valiant Soldiers,</HI> and to be ambi∣tious of Victory and Conquest. Now seeing you have been enabled by God not only to fight valiantly against <HI>flesh and blood,</HI> but against the <HI>Devil</HI> and his temptations, and (through the assistance of grace) have overcome him, I exhort you to take especial care that he do not at any time surprize you, and so prevail over you. <HI>3.</HI> Let me speak unto you <HI>little Children.</HI> The first know∣ledg <HI>young Children</HI> use to have, is of their Father. They know their Fa∣thers before other men, and are more fond of them than of others: Seeing there∣fore you know your <HI>heavenly Father,</HI> I exhort you that you endeavour to ex∣press a very ardent affection to him, and to labour to please him, and to be obedient to him in all things. Again, I reiterate and re-inforce my exhorta∣tion upon you <HI>ancient men,</HI> to imprint it the deeper upon you: And so like∣wise on you <HI>young men</HI> also, because Christ hath endued you with strength from above (which is far more excellent than your natural strength), and hath put his <HI>word</HI> into your minds (which is the Sword of the Spirit, <HI>Eph. 6.17.</HI>), whereby you have been inabled to overcome the <HI>evil one.</HI> Take you heed especially, lest at any time he prevail over you, and so deprive you of the glory of your victory. And seeing both <HI>old men,</HI> and those that are in their <HI>middle-age,</HI> are apt to <HI>love the world</HI> too much; let me exhort you all to take heed of all <HI>inordinate love</HI> of it, or of any of the things that are in it. For <HI>such a love</HI> of the world, and <HI>the true love</HI> of God, are inconsistent; because the <HI>one</HI> promotes corruption and sin, and the <HI>other</HI> sanctification and holiness. And you should consider, that <HI>all the things</HI> that are in the world (which
<PB N="439" REF="227"/> can invite us to love them), are reducible to these <HI>three heads: 1. The lust of the flesh,</HI> that is, all corporeal delights and pleasures. <HI>2. The lust of the eye,</HI> that is, all visible possessions and riches, and outward estate. <HI>3. The pride of life;</HI> that is, all honours, pomp, high places, and advancements. And an inordinate affecting or lusting after these things, comes from the corruption that prevails in the world, and in worldly men; and not from the Father, unto whose holiness they are no way agreeable. And besides this, they should consider, that the <HI>World,</HI> and <HI>the things therein</HI> (that are so lusted after<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">So <HI>lust</HI> is to be taken here; as <HI>hope</HI> is put for the thing <HI>hoped for,</HI> Ro. 8.24. and <HI>faith</HI> for the thing <HI>believed,</HI> Jude 3.</NOTE>), are but <HI>transitory</HI> and fading things, and soon pass away; neither can they give to those that most love them, any durable feli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity. But on the contrary, they that set themselves to do the will of God, and to mortifie those inordinate lusts and affections to the things of the world, shall obtain eter∣nal life<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg">Sub tam magnâ spe nulli la∣bores duri videri debent. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE>. Lastly, He addresses himself again to those whom he before call'd <HI>little children:</HI> He intimates to them, that though <HI>covetousness</HI> and the <HI>love of the world</HI> is not usually found in that age, as it is in the two former; yet the <HI>weakness</HI> of their understandings, and <HI>want of sound judgment</HI> and <HI>discerning,</HI> doth commonly expose them to a danger of ano∣ther kind, and that is, <HI>to be seduced</HI> and drawn away by erroneous Teachers. And though there were many <HI>Seducers</HI> in former ages, yet he tells them, that now they will be more rife than ever. For this is <HI>the last time;</HI> The destru∣ction of the <HI>City,</HI> and <HI>Temple,</HI> and <HI>Polity</HI> of the Jews was now at hand. Ye have heard (says he) of a great and notorious <HI>Antichrist</HI> (the Prince of all Seducers) that shall come and appear in the world [see <HI>2 Thes. 2.3.</HI>]; I tell you, <HI>He</HI> is not yet come; but there are sundry <HI>fore-runners</HI> of him come, such as will endeavour to draw men off from believing in Christ the true Messias, and will perswade them to believe lyes. And our Saviour him∣self fore-told <HI>[Mat. 24.11, 24.],</HI> that such Seducers as these would come, and advertised us of the time of their coming; and according to his prediction, there are now many <HI>Antichrists</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg">Quod Johannes de Antichri∣stis jam exortis ait, illud verissimum esse ex Cerenithi, Ebionis, Simoniis Magi, Basilidis &amp; Nicolaitarum hi∣storiâ constat. <HI>Gom.</HI></NOTE> come into the world, <HI>viz. false prophets,</HI> who corrupt the Christian Doctrine; and being acted by such a <HI>Spirit of error</HI> as the <HI>grand Antichrist</HI> will be acted by, they may well partake of his name; and by their swarming now, you may know that the <HI>last time</HI> is come. And these <HI>Antichrists</HI> and <HI>false Teachers,</HI> he shews, once held external communion with Ortho∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x and faithful Christians; but they departed from their communion, and thereby de∣clared, that they never were sound members of that Body. If they had been of the <HI>same Faith,</HI> and had really believed the same truth, they would not have departed from them. But as for them, he tells them, he need not write much about this matter; for they had <HI>an Unction from the Holy One;</HI> that is, they were furnished with the gifts and graces of the <HI>illuminating</HI> and <HI>san∣ctifying</HI> Spirit of Christ, teaching them all things ne∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssary<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg">Ver. 20. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] scil. quae ad vitandos tales impostores sunt necessaria.

Therefore his writing to them now, was not because he apprehended they were ignorant of the <HI>truth;</HI> but seeing they knew the truth, he was willing to con∣firm them in it; and he doubted not, but by their know∣ing the truth, they would be able to discern a <HI>lye,</HI> or a <HI>false doctrine</HI> from it, seeing it doth in no wise agree with it. A <HI>lye</HI> or <HI>falshood,</HI> he tells them, hath nothing of the nature of truth in it; therefore they will not easily receive the <HI>one</HI> for the <HI>other.</HI> Now he would have them consider, what Lye or Falshood can be equal to the denying of the great Truths of the Gospel? And who is a greater <HI>lyar</HI> and <HI>seducer,</HI> than he <HI>that</HI> denies Jesus to be the pro∣mised Messias? Whoever doth so, he tells them, is <HI>an Antichrist,</HI> and denies in effect both the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI> He denies the <HI>Son</HI> directly; he denies
<PB N="440" REF="228"/> the <HI>Father</HI> by consequence, who testified<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg">See chap. 5.9, 10.</NOTE> of Christ by his voice from Heaven, and by Miracles; which testimony is not true, if Jesus be not the Christ. Therefore whosoever denieth the <HI>Son</HI> to be the <HI>Messias,</HI> or denieth his <HI>Person, Natures, Offices,</HI> or <HI>Merits,</HI> he is <HI>an Antichrist</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg">Non quod <HI>eximius ille Anti∣christus</HI> primus id facturus sit, sed quod eximiè &amp; impudentèr supra caeteros, ac majore cum effectu.</NOTE>, and denies as well the testimony of the <HI>Father,</HI> as the <HI>Mes∣sias-ship</HI> of the Son. And whosoever denieth the <HI>Son,</HI> cannot have the Father for <HI>his God,</HI> or <HI>reconciled Fa∣ther,</HI> seeing there is no reconciliation for <HI>fallen man</HI> with God, but <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Christ. He advises them therefore, that what∣ever their temptations should be, they should not forsake the <HI>Doctrine</HI> which from the beginning of their Christianity they had received. To which if they firmly adhered, they should continue in the <HI>favour</HI> and <HI>love,</HI> and in the communion of God the <HI>Father,</HI> and of Christ Jesus his Son. And whatsoe∣ver hazzards they should run by so doing, they might comfort themselves with this, That He hath promised eternal life to all that continue in the faith and obedience of his doctrine. These things he tells them he had written to them, to arm them against the <HI>Seducers</HI> that were now among them. But he need not give them any other <HI>armature</HI> than what they had already. For the <HI>an∣nointing</HI> which they had receiv'd from Christ (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>illumination</HI> of his Spirit) abiding in them, would teach them all things ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essary to salvation. And they need not that any man should teach them any <HI>new doctrine,</HI> any <HI>new fundamental principles</HI> of Faith, as yet strange and unknown to them. They need no <HI>new Gospel</HI> or <HI>Doctrine</HI> for kind and substance, though they need more teaching in order to their growth and further improvement in real Piety and Christianity. Seeing therefore the <HI>Anointing</HI> which they had re∣ceived from the Spirit of Christ, instructed them concerning all things ne∣cessary to salvation, and seeing what it taught and suggested, was the <HI>very truth,</HI> and no lye; he was confident they would abide in Christ, and the pro∣fession of his truth. And now returning to speak to them all in general, he exhorts them to look to it, that they do <HI>abide in the faith of Christ,</HI> in his communion and doctrine, and thereby they shall have confidence to look him in the face, and not be ashamed to present themselves before him at the great and glorious day when he shall come to judg the world. <HI>From Ver. 13, to 29.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> He exhorts them to the sincere practice of righteousness, and to aban∣don all manner of sin and unrighteousness. For if they know and be sen∣sible (as sure they must needs be), that God<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="marg">Transit de <HI>Christo</HI> ad <HI>Deum;</HI> nec id mirum, cum utrius{que} mentio praecesserit. <HI>Grot.</HI></NOTE> is a God infinitely <HI>righteous</HI> and holy, they may well know also, that whosoever is born of him, and hath received a new and divine life from him, doth endeavour to live righteously, and thereby declares himself to be a child of his, and like unto him; and, <HI>as a son,</HI> may expect protection, and an inheritance from him. <HI>V. 29.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Chap."/> He shews what a great and high favour it is, that <HI>true believers</HI> and <HI>righteous persons</HI> should both <HI>be,</HI> and also be <HI>accounted</HI> and <HI>acknowledg∣ed</HI> for the children of God, and should have the priviledges belonging to that state. 'Tis true, the world doth not acknowledg them for <HI>such,</HI> but mocks and jeers at them, because they pretend to it: And this is not much to be mar∣velled at; for, not knowing the Father, of whose Spirit they are <HI>spiritually</HI> and <HI>supernaturally</HI> begotten; and being ignorant of the holy nature of God, no wonder they acknowledg not those for his children who resemble him in holiness. But, says he, let the world judg what it will, the <HI>state</HI> and condi∣tion of us▪ that are true believers, is the <HI>state</HI> and condition of the children of God. We have at present the <HI>right</HI> of children, but what we shall be hereafter, and what shall be the glory of that inheritance that shall be made over to us, is not fully manifested: but this we know, that when that blessed time shall arrive when Christ shall come to judg the world, we shall then be

For Christ (in whom there was no sin) was manifest <HI>in the flesh</HI> to take away sin; the <HI>guilt</HI> of it by his blood, the <HI>power</HI> of it by his Spirit.

For, says he, let no man de∣ceive you, and make you believe that a <HI>true faith</HI> may consist with an unholy and impure life.

But on the contrary, he that <HI>com∣mitteth sin,</HI> that is, giveth himself up to a course of sin, is a <HI>child of the Devil,</HI> and resembles him, who sinned at the beginning, soon after the Creation, and from that time hath ever since been a <HI>Tempter,</HI> inspiring by his sug∣gestions and temptations an inclination to sin, into the minds and souls of men. But the <HI>Son of Man</HI> was not only perfectly free from sin himself, but came into the world to <HI>destroy the works of the Devil, viz.</HI> to remove the <HI>guilt</HI> of sin to believers, and to free them from the <HI>punishment</HI> of it, by <HI>his merits</HI> and <HI>intercession,</HI> and to <HI>regenerate</HI> and <HI>sanctifie</HI> their natures by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> and so to destroy the do∣minion and power of sin in them. Therefore they that give themselves up to a course of sin, belong not to <HI>Christ,</HI> but to the <HI>Devil.</HI> For he that is <HI>born of God,</HI> and regenerated by his Spirit, doth not indulge himself in a course of sin, as carnal unregenerate persons do, because he hath a <HI>seed of grace</HI> re∣pugnant thereunto, remaining in him; and he cannot deliberately and freely allow himself in sin, because by the grace of regeneration the dominion of sin is broken in him. The <HI>new nature</HI> wrought in him by the <HI>word of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See 1 Pet. 1.23.</NOTE>, ac∣companied with his Spirit, is a principle that abhors sin, and fights against it. Therefore a <HI>course of sin,</HI> or delighting in sin, is unreconcilable with this state. In the conclusion of this discourse, he tells them, that by these <HI>two marks</HI> the chil∣dren of God may be manifestly distinguished from the children of the Devil: They that <HI>live righteously,</HI> and holily, and <HI>sincerely love their brethren,</HI> are the children of God; and they that <HI>do not,</HI> are of the Devil. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 11.</HI></P>

And this is a great matter. For, says he, if our own hearts and consciences witness against us, and condemn us, that we <HI>do not sincerely love God and our Neighbour;</HI> God, who knows all things, and is greater and mightier to condemn than our consciences, will much more condemn us. But if our consciences (though they may accuse us of imperfe∣ction) yet do not condemn us of hypocrisie, or want of charity, then we have boldness and confidence towards God, that he will own us for his children, and will hear our prayers, and that we shall obtain those good things of him which we ask <HI>according to his will,</HI> because we are <HI>such</HI> as do endeavour (through his grace) to obey and observe his commandments, and to do the things pleasing in his sight.

For they had by their stedfastness in the true doctrine, already overcome the machinations and perswasions of such <HI>Impostors</HI> and <HI>Deceivers</HI> as have been among them, and have not been prevailed upon by them, as others have been. For Christ, who by his <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI> dwells in them, is greater and more powerful than the Devil (the Spirit of Error), who rules and domineers in worldly and unregenerate men, such as <HI>Seducers</HI> are. They commonly are worldly and sensual men, and their doctrine<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Ex mundano affectu mundana loquuntur. <HI>Zeger.</HI></NOTE> is agreeable to the corrupt humour and inclination of worldly-minded men, and therefore no wonder that the world readily bears them.

He that abideth in the sincere exercises of love to God and his Neigh∣bour, abideth and continueth in the love and favour of God, and God dwelleth in him by the graces and com∣forts of his holy Spirit.

So the Greek text will bear.</NOTE> God with our highest and best affections, for he loved us first, when we were <HI>enemies</HI> and <HI>sinners,</HI> and had deserved nothing but hatred and vengeance from him. But possibly every body will say, <HI>I love God.</HI> He answers, That whosoever saith, <HI>He lo∣veth God,</HI> and yet <HI>hateth his brother,</HI> is plainly a lyar. For 'tis impossible <HI>truly to love God,</HI> and not to do what God com∣mands; and one thing which he strictly commands, is, that we <HI>love our Bro∣ther.</HI> And if we do not exercise love to our brethren with whom we daily
<PB N="445" REF="230"/> converse, and whose <HI>persons, state,</HI> and <HI>condition,</HI> we see and know; what reason is there to imagine we do sincerely love God, when of our love to him, and the sincerity of it, we were never able to make this trial, because we never saw him, nor had opportunity offered us of shewing any real acts of love to him, otherwise than by obeying his commands, whereof this is one, That if we love him, we should testifie it by loving our brother also. <HI>From Ver. 7, to the end.</HI></P>
<P>He proceeds to shew, that the <HI>love of God,</HI> and <HI>of the children of God,</HI> <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="Chap."/> must needs go together, there being so near a relation between them. For they that are spiritually begotten of God, and brought seriously and savingly to be∣lieve in Jesus Christ as the true Messias, they so love God, that they love his children also. They cannot truly love the Father, but they must needs love the Children in whom they see his Image. And there is such an union and conjunction between these two, that if we would know whether we love our Brethren sincerely or no, we cannot better judg of it, than by examining whether we truly love God. For otherwise, we may do many acts of kind∣ness to our Brethren which may flow from other principles (as good nature, credit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) and not from such a charity as manifests and expresses it self by ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vouring to keep God's commandments. For this is the love that God requires of us, and hereby we shall evidence that we do <HI>indeed</HI> love him, if we faithfully endeavour to keep his Commandments. And his <HI>Commandments</HI> to the <HI>Regenerate</HI> are not grievous, because of the gracious assistance afforded to them by the Spirit of God. <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>hope of reward,</HI> and <HI>the assist∣ance of the Spirit,</HI> will make things that are difficult to flesh and blood, easie and delightful. And he that is born of God, abideth constant in his Christian profession, notwithstanding all worldly allurements, temptations, or op∣positions to the contrary. And that which enables him thus to overcome the world (which is so apt to draw away the heart from God), is not any power of nature, but <HI>faith in Christ,</HI> from whom he receives strength to do it. So that <HI>faith</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Fidem</HI> per Metonym. appellat <HI>victoriam,</HI> h. e.

<P>He comes now to prove, That Jesus is the Christ, that he is truly <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> and the true Messias that was to come into the world to be the Sa∣viour of mankind.

<P>IN the <HI>Preface</HI> he stiles himself the <HI>Elder,</HI> in respect of his great age and office in the Church. He addresses his Epistle to an eminent <HI>Gentlewo∣man</HI> (whom, for those eminent graces and virtues that shined in her, be judges <HI>elect</HI> of God); and to her <HI>children,</HI> who had been religiously educated by her, all whom he professes sincerely to love, as did all others also thereabout, who had been brought to a saving-knowledg of the Gospel, and had effectually en∣tertained it. And the ground of his sincere and cordial love to them, he shews was this, That they had embraced the same <HI>Gospel-truth</HI> with himself, and other faithful Christians; and he was confident they would always abide and remain in the sincere belief and profession thereof. To this <HI>Lady</HI> and <HI>her chil∣dren</HI> he heartily wishes an <HI>encrease of grace,</HI> and an abundance of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> from God the <HI>Father,</HI> the Fountain of all blessings, and from Je∣sus Christ his <HI>Son,</HI> the Conduit-pipe by which they are conveyed; and par∣ticularly, that they may continue constant in the profession of the <HI>Truth,</HI> and in the exercise of <HI>Love</HI> to one another. <HI>From Ver. 1, to 4.</HI></P>

<P>THE Third <HI>Epistle</HI> of <HI>John</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Third Epistle of Iohn.</NOTE> was directed to his beloved <HI>Gaius.</HI> We find three persons of this name in the Scripture; <HI>1.

<P>And in the <HI>first place</HI> he assures him, That he loved him sincerely, and accordingly wished unto him, that as he had a <HI>healthful soul,</HI> endued with the knowledg of sound doctrine, and with the manifold graces of the Spirit of God; so he might also have a <HI>healthful body,</HI> and that all his outward <HI>conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rns</HI> might suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed prosperously.

And there was great reason he should do it, because it was on Christ's errand (that is, to preach his Gospel) that they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles, to whom they preached, for their pains. 'Tis necessary therefore, he tells him, they should be received by some. And they that shall receive them, shall thereby have the comfort of having <HI>co-operated</HI> and contributed their part towards the propagating the Gospel of Christ. And to this purp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se he had written to the Church there (whereof <HI>Gaius</HI> was a member), <HI>viz.</HI> to give relief and succour to such faithful servants of Christ; but <HI>Diotrephes</HI> (a Presbyter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Diotrephes hic, suit aliquis ex Presbyteris ejus Ecclesiae in quâ erat Gaius, ex <HI>Gentili</HI> factus Christianus.

<PB N="4" REF="233"/> inclination to receive them, he prohibits them; and if they do it, he either rejects them, or threatens to <HI>reject</HI> and <HI>cast</HI> them out of the Church. He advises <HI>Gaius</HI> therefore, not to be an <HI>imitator</HI> of this evil example of <HI>Dio∣trephes,</HI> but to exercise kindness to the Jewish Christians. For he that sin∣cerely endeavours to do good, and to be merciful, shews himself to be of a Christian temper, and to be born of God; but he that is <HI>malicious,</HI> and <HI>proud,</HI> and <HI>uncharitable,</HI> hath no true saving-knowledg of God, whatever he pretends. He acknowledgeth, that <HI>Demetrius</HI> (a Gentile-Convert) hath a very good report for <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> feom all the faithful that know him. Yea, he says he hath done many things that more fully testifie the same of him, than the report of men can do. And the same testimony the Apostle himself, with others, did give of him also. And thou knowest (says he) that I am not wont to affirm things which are not true. In conclusion, he excuses his writing so short an Epistle to him, seeing he hoped shortly to see him, and to speak much more to him than now he had written. And so concludes with his Apostolical Valediction and Salutation.</P>

<P>HAVING thus, by the good Providence of God (to whom alone be all the glory and praise thereof in∣tirely rendred <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through</HI> Jesus Christ), finished my <HI>Apostolick History;</HI> I thought it requisite, for the clearing of many passages in <HI>this History,</HI> as also in the <HI>Gospels,</HI> to add a short Narration of the dreadful Destruction of the <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And first, I will set down the <HI>prodigious</HI> and dreadful Sights<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Luc. 21.11.</NOTE> that preceded the Warr that brought on this fatal Desolation; and then shew the <HI>Occasion</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prodigies</HI> related by <HI>Josephus</HI> were these: Not long be∣fore the Warr, on the day of <HI>Ʋnleavened bread,</HI> about nine of the clock at night, between the <HI>Altar</HI> and the <HI>Temple</HI> there shined such a <HI>light,</HI> that it might have been thought to be <HI>mid-day,</HI> which continued half an hour. In the same <HI>Feast</HI> also a <HI>Cow</HI> that was led to sacrifice, brought forth a <HI>Lamb</HI> in the middle of the Court of the Temple. The East gate of the Temple, which was Brass, and mighty heavy, and could scarce be shut with twenty men, and at evening was lock'd up, and barr'd with barrs of Iron, was seen (about six of the clock at night) to open of its own accord. On the 21 of <HI>May,</HI> before Sun-set, were seen in the air <HI>Iron Chariots,</HI> and Armies in battel-array passing along in the Clouds, and be∣gitting the City. And in the Feast of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> the Priests going into the inner Temple, according to custom, to celebrate the Worship of God, at first they found the place to move, and heard a noise; and afterwards they heard a voice, which said, <HI>Let us depart hence.</HI> A Blazing-star in fashion of a Sword, hung over the City for a year together: See <HI>Har. of the Four Evangelists,</HI> chap. 5. p. 168. And thus much of the <HI>Prodigies</HI> that preceded the Warr. I come now to shew the <HI>Occasion</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Occasion</HI> of the Warr that brought that fatal ruin and destruction upon the City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the <HI>Jewish</HI> State,
<PB N="454" REF="235"/> was this: <HI>Florus</HI> being sent by <HI>Nero</HI> to succeed <HI>Albinus</HI> in the <HI>Procuratorship of Judea,</HI> being a vile and wicked person, outra∣giously abused his Authority, and by all manner of Rapines and Insolencies vex'd and oppressed the <HI>Jews;</HI> insomuch, that by a <HI>publick Cryer</HI> he gave leave to <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>High way-men</HI> to rob and spoil throughout the whole Countrey, provided he himself might have part and share of the booty. The <HI>Jews</HI> not able to endure these Outrages, some of them abandoned their houses, and fled to strange Countreys. Others of them (being of themselves forward enough to revolt) were yet greatly provoked thereunto by the daily oppressions of <HI>Flo∣rus,</HI> who endeavoured to drive them to it, that his great and intolerable Oppressions and Villanies might be lessened by their Revolt. Another thing also that much dispos'd them thereunto, was this: There was a Pro∣phecy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Suetonius</HI> Vesp. c. 4. Pererebue∣rat oriente toto vetus &amp; constans opinio, esse in fatis, ut eo tempore Ju∣dea profecti rerum potirentur. Id de Imperatore Romano (quantum eventu postea paruit) praedictum, Judaei ad se trahentes, rebellârunt. Ac similiter <HI>Cornel. Tacitus,</HI> Hist. lib. 5.</NOTE> passed among them <HI>[That there should come from Judaea those that should be Masters of all].</HI> The event afterwards shewed, that this was a Prediction only of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor. But the <HI>Jews</HI> applying it to them∣selves, revolted; and so Christ's blood lying upon them, and crying for vengeance, they themselves hastened that vengeance by their own Madness. The Warr began in the <HI>Twelfth year of Nero,</HI> in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> who was then in <HI>Grecia,</HI> and stayed there till Winter.</P>
<P>King <HI>Agrippa</HI> (who had under his government <HI>Galilee, Tibe∣rias, Tarichea, Julias</HI> beyond <HI>Jordan,</HI> with the neighbouring-Villages, and <HI>Chaleis</HI>), in a long Oration dehorts the <HI>Jews</HI> from warr, but in vain. For a little while after he was gone from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> some of the <HI>Seditious</HI> possessed themselves, on a sudden, of the strong Castle <HI>Massada,</HI> and put to the sword all the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> they found there. At <HI>Jerusalem</HI> also, <HI>Eleazer</HI> the son of <HI>Ananias</HI> the High-Priest, and Commander of the Soldiers of the Temple (a bold and factious young man) perswaded the Priests that they should not offer any more the Sacrifices that were wont to be offered for <HI>Caesar,</HI> and the welfare of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Which rash act, the Governours of the City (that were peaceable men) plainly saw tended to open rebellion. Whereupon, not being able to perswade the <HI>Seditious</HI> from this course, they sent Messengers to <HI>Florus</HI> at <HI>Caesarea,</HI> and to King <HI>Agrippa;</HI> desiring them; that they would presently send Forces and suppress the Rebellion in the beginning. <HI>Florus,</HI> who de∣sired there should be a Revolt, neglected it. But King <HI>Agrippa</HI> sent a thousand Horse-men, who together with the Rulers and Priests, and the rest of the people (that loved peace), seized upon and held the upper City against the Seditious, who kept the Temple, and the lower City. Between these two parties there were continual skirmishes for seven days together. After some ado the <HI>Rebels</HI> brake into the upper Quarters, burnt divers Palaces and publick Houses, and then besieged the Castle

<P>In the mean time there was a great dissention throughout all <HI>Judea,</HI> some being for <HI>warr,</HI> others desirous to live in peace under the protection of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Whereupon Troops of Thieves gathered together, who plundered them that were de∣sirous of peace; and being loaded with their Plunder, they were received into <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and there fill'd all things wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Murthers, Discords, and Rapines. And first, they cast <HI>Antipas</HI> and a great many Noble-men, and the chief of the City into prison, and shortly after put them to death without any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rial; falsly accusing them, That they intended to deliver up t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> City to the <HI>Romans.</HI> Moreover they kept all the Passes, and seized those that endeavoured to get out of the City; and, killing them, let them lye unburied.</P>
<P>During these troubles, the <HI>Zealots</HI> fell out among themselves: <HI>John</HI> (who came from <HI>Giscala</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem</HI>) affecting the Sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remacy, and others not enduring him to be their Superior.

<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> by these discords thus inhumanly destroying each other; <HI>Vespasian</HI> was entreated by the cryes of some of them (who fled to him) to take some course to preserve their Coun∣trey from ruin.

Then leads them thorow <HI>Samaria</HI> to <HI>Jericho,</HI> from whence the Inhabitants flye into the <HI>Mountain-Countrey</HI> opposite to <HI>Jerusa∣lem;</HI> but he pursues them and beats them from the Hills, and by placing Citadels at <HI>Jericho</HI> and other places, distresses the <HI>Jews</HI> on every side.</P>
<P><HI>Nero</HI> hearing that <HI>Galba,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> had revolted from him, pronounced himself undone; and at last slew himself to escape publick and more shameful execution, on the 9th day of <HI>June,</HI> in the 13th year of his Reign.</P>
<P>The Soldiers in <HI>Spain</HI> proclaim <HI>Galba</HI> Emperor, against whom rises up <HI>Otho,</HI> and cuts him off in his 7th Month. <HI>Otho</HI> was scarce set in the Throne, when <HI>Vitellius</HI> riseth up against him, and <HI>Otho</HI> is kill'd the 90th day of his Reign. <HI>Vitellius</HI> is now <HI>Lord of all,</HI> a luxurious and most intemperate person.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Vespasian,</HI> who as he was now with his Ar∣my preparing to besiege <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> news is brought him of the death of <HI>Nero.</HI> Upon which tidings he defers the Warr against the <HI>Jews,</HI> and sends <HI>Titus</HI> his Son to <HI>Galba</HI> (who he heard was proclaimed Emperor), to know his pleasure concerning the Jewish Warr. <HI>Titus</HI> going by ship to <HI>Achaia,</HI> heard there that <HI>Galba</HI> was killed. Whereupon he presently returns to his Fa∣ther at <HI>Caesarea,</HI> they being in suspence (the Empire now totter∣ing) what to do, thinking it not convenient to invade a strange Countrey, when their own was in such apparent danger.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Simon</HI> the Son of <HI>Giora</HI> (of whom before) a bold young man, went from <HI>Massada,</HI> whither he had fled to the Murderers, in the Mountainous Countrey of <HI>Judea,</HI> and by promises of liberty to servants, and rewards to <HI>Free-men,</HI> in a short time got a band of Thieves, and by little and little en∣creasing his Forces, he came at last to that power, that he con∣quered all <HI>Idumea,</HI> and wasted <HI>Judea,</HI> and at length came be∣fore <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> where pitching his Tents, he became a terror both to the Inhabitants of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and to the <HI>Zealots</HI> also; and thus were the Citizens of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> grievously oppressed on both sides, <HI>within</HI> by the <HI>Zealots</HI> whom <HI>John</HI> commanded; and <HI>without</HI> by <HI>Simon.</HI> In the mean time the <HI>Idumeans,</HI> who were of <HI>John</HI>'s party, and were among his forces, falling at variance with him, and the matter coming to blows, they kil∣led many of the <HI>Zealots;</HI> and then taking <HI>John</HI>'s Palace, and burning it, forced him with his party into the Temple; but then they fearing (as also did the Citizens) lest by night he should make an excursion into the City, and burn it, they upon consultation send for <HI>Simon,</HI> and admit him into the City, that they might defend themselves against <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vespasian,</HI> during these stirrs, hearing of <HI>Otho</HI>'s death, began to think of freeing his Countrey from the Tyranny of <HI>Vitellius.</HI>
<PB N="459" REF="237"/> Many of his Commanders earnestly perswaded him to take the Government upon him. <HI>Tiberius Alexander</HI> the Governour of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was the first that swore the Legions to him on the Ca∣lends of <HI>July,</HI> which day was afterwards kept as a Festival. Shortly after, the Jewish Army swore Allegiance to him; so that there was but one year and twenty two days, between <HI>Nero</HI>'s death, and the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Vespasian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vespasian</HI> (the Armies in several Provinces declaring for him) now leaves <HI>Caesarea;</HI> and sending <HI>Mutianus</HI> with Forces into <HI>Italy,</HI> to oppose <HI>Vitellias,</HI> himself goes to <HI>Alexandria</HI> to make sure of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Maesia, Antonius Primus</HI> who held for <HI>Vespasian,</HI> leads the third Legion into <HI>Italy</HI> against <HI>Vitellius,</HI> and in the fight at <HI>Cre∣mona</HI> against the <HI>Vitellians,</HI> he routs them, and puts them to flight. Then coming to <HI>Rome,</HI> and joining his Forces with <HI>Mutianus</HI> in the midst of the City, he overthrows <HI>Vitellius</HI>'s Army; and taking <HI>Vitellius</HI> himself, and dragging him thorow the Market-place, there cuts his Throat, after he had held the Government eight Months and five days.</P>
<P><HI>Vespasian</HI> hearing these things at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> sends his Son <HI>Titus</HI> with Forces into <HI>Judea,</HI> to finish that Warr; but he him∣self saileth into <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was at this time divided into a three∣fold Faction: For <HI>Simon,</HI> whom the Citizens had admitted in, kept the higher City; and <HI>John</HI> with his <HI>Zealots</HI> possessed the outward Courts of the <HI>Temple,</HI> and the lower City. And <HI>Elea∣zer,</HI> who was once Captain and Commander of the <HI>Zealots</HI> (envying <HI>John,</HI> who by his boldness and subtilty had got the power into his hands, and did all things at his own pleasure) withdrawing himself, and getting some Soldiers along with him, possessed himself of the <HI>inner</HI> part of the Temple, and from thence fights against <HI>John.</HI> And so <HI>John,</HI> who held the outward Circuit of the Temple, and the Porches, was forced to fight both against <HI>Eleazer</HI> and <HI>Simon.</HI> During these stirrs, many things about the Temple were burnt up, and the Provisions destroyed which might have served them a long time, and for want of which they were sorely oppressed with Famine after∣wards, when besieged by the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Titus,</HI> in prosecution of his Father's Orders, comes from <HI>Alex∣andria</HI> to <HI>Caesarea,</HI> where gathering his Forces together (which were <HI>Four Legions,</HI> with the Aids and Auxiliaries of the Neigh∣bouring-Kings), marches towards <HI>Jerusalem</HI> accompanied with <HI>Tiberius Alexander</HI> (who was in principal favour with him), and <HI>Joseph</HI> the Jew, who for the truth of his prediction that <HI>Vespasian</HI> should be Emperor, was now released out of bonds. He sate down within six or seven furlongs of the City, a little before the Feast of the <HI>Passover,</HI> and by that means shut up an infinite number of men, who had (according to custom) come up to the Feast. And hereby all provisions were consumed in a very short time, and a most cruel Famine oppressed them On
<PB N="460" REF="238"/> the day of <HI>Ʋnleavened-bread</HI> (April 14.), <HI>Eleazar</HI> (who kept the inner part of the Temple) opened the Gates to the people who desired to sacrifice; but <HI>John</HI> taking hold of this opportu∣nity, treacherously sent many of his party in among them (with swords hid under their Garments), who killing <HI>Eleazar</HI> and many of his Faction, seized also on that part of the Temple; and hereby the Three <HI>Factions</HI> were reduced to Two; that under <HI>John</HI> consisted of 8400, and the other under <HI>Simon</HI> of 10000 fight∣ing-men, besides 5000 <HI>Idumeans.</HI> And notwithstanding the Ene∣my was at the Walls, they brake out, the one upon the other, and the poor people suffered miserably under both. The City being fortified with three Walls on every side, but where it was fenced with deep Valleys, <HI>Titus</HI> having with much opposition placed his <HI>Engines</HI> and <HI>Rams,</HI> battered the outermost of them, and made a breach in it; at which entring, and the Jews reti∣ring inwards, he possessed himself of the North-quarter of the City, even to the Castle <HI>Antonia,</HI> and the Valley of <HI>Cedron.</HI> Five days after, he brake with his <HI>Rams</HI> the Second Wall, and entred; but the Besieged making divers Salleys, repulsed him, and beat him out again. Four days after, he recovers the place again▪ and prepares for the bittering the Third Wall. He now sends <HI>Joseph</HI> the Historian to perswade them to yeild; but he is entertain'd only with scoffs and reproaches. Many of the peo∣ple thinking to escape out of the City, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Simon</HI> stop up all passages. Yet the Famine encreasing, many made shift to get out, who being taken by <HI>Titus,</HI> he caused them to be cru∣cified On the 12th of <HI>May</HI> he began <HI>Four Mounts,</HI> wherein to place his Battering Rams; Two, near the Castle <HI>Antonia,</HI> by which he hoped to take the Temple; and the other Two near the Monument of <HI>John</HI> the High-Priest, where he thought he should with most ease break into the upper part of the City. <HI>John,</HI> who was to oppose the <HI>Romans</HI> in the former place, cast down the Mounts that were near his Quarter, and two days after <HI>Simon</HI> did as much by the other, though seventeen days had been spent in making of them. He destroyed also many Rams and Engines, and brake into the very Camp of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> but was repell'd and forc'd into the City again. <HI>Titus</HI> now calling a Council of Warr, 'twas therein resolved to com∣pass the whole City with a Trench, which with incredible di∣ligence and celerity was finished in three day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; they built also thirteen Forts to hinder the flight of the Besieged, and to hin∣der the conveyance of any relief into the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seditious</HI> were nothing herewith moved, though <HI>Famine</HI> not only raged among the common sort, but themselves also were pressed by it A certain <HI>Noble Woman</HI> sod her Child to eat it; and such a Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y ensued, that from the 14 of <HI>April</HI> to the first of <HI>July,</HI> were carried out to be buried at the publick charge, an incredible number of Carkasses of the poorer sort, as <HI>Titus</HI> was told by one <HI>Mannaeus,</HI> who was appointed to pay the money. And some others certified him, that many thousands of the ordinary
<PB N="461" REF="238"/> sort were cast dead out of the Gates; and because they could not carry all out, they cast them in great heaps together into empty houses, <HI>others</HI> they threw over the Walls, filling up the Ditches with them.</P>
<P><HI>Simon,</HI> notwithstanding all these calamities, abstained not from Murthers and Rapines, but kill'd <HI>Mathias</HI> the High-Priest (by whom he had been let into the City) with his three Sons, and sixteen of the Noblest of the people, pretending that they purposed to flee to the Enemy. <HI>Judas,</HI> one of his own Cap∣tains, hating his cruelty, attempted to betray a certain <HI>Tower</HI> (whereof he had the charge) to the <HI>Romans;</HI> but his design being discovered, he was put to death, with ten other of his Complices. <HI>John</HI> also, in these extremities, converted to his own, and prophane uses, the holy things of the Temple, as Vessels of Gold, and Silver, and the Money of the Temple; nay, he was compell'd to distribute to his Soldiers the very Oil and Wine ordain'd for Sacrifices.</P>
<P><HI>Titus,</HI> in pursuit of his design, cut down all the Groves near the City, and brought in the Timber to make Forts and Engins for the siege, and causing more Mounts or Scaffolds to be made, on the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st day of <HI>July</HI> he began to batter the wall of the Castle <HI>Antonia,</HI> by which a breach being made on the fifth day after, they entred the Castle, and pursued the flying-Jews even unto the Temple. At this time many <HI>false Prophets</HI> (suborned by the <HI>Seditious</HI>) flattered the multitude with expectation of assistance from God; and therefore though <HI>Titus</HI> often exhorted them to yeeld, yet they flatly refused. The <HI>Romans</HI> now pressing hard towards the Temple, the Contest was earnest on both sides. After a long skirmish, the <HI>Romans</HI> breaking in by <HI>Antonia,</HI> sei∣zed upon the North and West Porches of the outward Range of the Temple; part of which Porches (especially that which was join'd to <HI>Antonia</HI>) was burnt and overthrown by the <HI>Jews;</HI> and two days after, the other part was burnt by the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Jews being so amaz'd, that they endeavour'd not to quench it. <HI>Titus</HI> had an intention to have sav'd the Temple; but on the tenth of <HI>August</HI> a certain Soldier <HI>without</HI> any command (nay, <HI>a∣gainst</HI> the command of his General), moved as by instinct from above, cast a flaming fire-brand into the Chambers and Build∣ings of the North-side of the Temple, which immediately taking fire, burnt the Temple also which joined to them, notwithstand∣ing all that <HI>Titus</HI> could do to prevent it. And this happened on the same day of the same Month on which the former Temple was set on fire by the command of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar.</HI></P>
<P>The Temple thus burning, <HI>Titus</HI> was saluted Emperor by his Soldiers, and the <HI>Zelots</HI> and <HI>Seditious</HI> fled into the Upper City call'd <HI>Sion.</HI> They now desire a parley with the <HI>General</HI> himself, who check'd them for their obstinacy, but promised them life if they would yeeld to him. They being unwilling to com∣mit themselves to his Mercy, requir'd to depart the City with their wives and children, and to go into the Wilderness.
<PB N="462" REF="239"/> <HI>Titus</HI> being enraged at these Proposals, threatens them with ut∣ter destruction, and forthwith commands all the lower City to be set on fire. Then he began to assault the Higher City, which was seated on a steep Rock. And beginning to raise his Mounts on the 20th of <HI>August,</HI> and perfecting them on the 7th of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> he brings his Engines to the Walls, wherein having made a breach, the <HI>Seditious</HI> through fear and amazement deserted their strong Towers, and so on the 8th of <HI>September</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> brake in and destroyed all with fire and sword. <HI>Titus</HI> now com∣mands both the City and Temple to be utterly razed to the foun∣dation, and to be laid plain, and a <HI>Plough to be brought over it,</HI> according to custom, which was done by <HI>Turnus Rufus;</HI> and so the Prophesie was fulfilled, <HI>Zion shall be plowed as a field,</HI> Mic. 3.12. Only the West part of the Wall, with three Towers, for their strength and beauty were preserved, to bear witness of the state∣liness of the City to posterity.</P>
<P>Of those which during the whole Warr were taken Captives, the number amounted to 97000: and of those that perished in the siege, to 1100000. So heavy was the guilt that lay on them for the death of Christ, and so horrid were the enormities com∣mitted by them, that <HI>Josephus</HI> says, <HI>If the Romans had delayed to come against them,</HI> he thought <HI>the City would either have been swal∣lowed up of the earth, or have perished by Thunder-bolts and Light∣ning from Heaven, and so have suffered like Sodom;</HI> the Inhabi∣tants whereof they exceeded in wickedness. See <HI>Josephus</HI> toward the end of his sixth Book.</P>
<P>And thus fell this famous City on the 8th day of <HI>September,</HI> in the second year of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> He and <HI>Titus</HI> his Son being <HI>Con∣suls,</HI> 38 years after the death of Christ, whose blood cried for vengeance against these obdurate Jews.</P>
<P>That this dismal destruction of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is set out <HI>Mat.</HI> 24, as the destruction of the whole World, need not seem strange if we consider, that it was the destroying of the Lord's own <HI>Ha∣bitation,</HI> and the <HI>place</HI> chosen by Himself above all the places in the world, to put His Name there, and the destroying of the State and Polity of the Jews, who were his <HI>old peculiar peo∣ple;</HI> A people once highest in his favour, now deepest in his dis∣pleasure: formerly the people of his highest dignations; but now their casting off was sealed by the ruin of their <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Temple,</HI> their dispersion and scattering abroad among other Na∣tions, and their great obduration.</P>
<P><HI>Titus</HI> having thus ended the Warr, returns to <HI>Caesarea,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Antiochia</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and then into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and thence sails to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he was welcomed home by all men, and (together with his Father) triumphed for the Conquest of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>The two Captains of the <HI>Seditious, John</HI> and <HI>Simon,</HI> who had hid themselves, were taken, and reserved to be led in triumph, and 700 other Jews that excelled in beauty and strength; of all whom only <HI>Simon</HI> suffered death. The <HI>LAW</HI> also of the
<PB N="463" REF="239"/> Jews was carried in this Triumph as the <HI>last of the spoils,</HI> which together with the <HI>Purple Veils</HI> of the Sanctuary, were laid up in the Palace.</P>
<P>From this Victory both <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son</HI> got the Name of <HI>Em∣peror;</HI> yet neither of them had the Title of <HI>Judaicus,</HI> although many other Honours, especially <HI>Triumphal Arches,</HI> were decreed unto them.</P>
<P>A year after, <HI>Lucilius Bassus</HI> was sent Lieutenant into <HI>Judea,</HI> who receiving the Army from <HI>Cerealis Vitellianus,</HI> took the Ca∣stle <HI>Herodian</HI> and <HI>Macharua</HI> beyond <HI>Jordan.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after, <HI>Vespasian</HI> wrote to <HI>Tiberius Maximus</HI> to <HI>sell all the Land of the Jews;</HI> upon whom, wheresoever they lived, he imposed a yearly Tribute to be paid into the <HI>Capitol,</HI> viz. the <HI>Didrachma</HI> or half Shekel, it being that they were wont to pay in former times unto the Temple at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>A year after, <HI>Publius</HI> succeeds <HI>Bassus,</HI> and finishes the Warr, taking the strong Castle of <HI>Massada</HI> from <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Judas Galilaeus</HI> the Captain of the Thieves. All the Thieves in the Castle (to the number of 900, with their Wives and Children) at the perswasion of <HI>Eleazar,</HI> set fire on the Castle, and the Fur∣niture thereof, and then put each other to death, lest they should fall into the power of the <HI>Romans.</HI> And so the Warr in <HI>Judea</HI> ended.</P>
<P>Many of the Thieves that escaped from <HI>Judea,</HI> fled into <HI>Egypt,</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and there they sollicited the Jews to revolt; but the common people taking 600 of them, delivered them up to the <HI>Romans</HI> to be punished. <HI>Vespasian</HI> having notice of these things, commands <HI>Lupus</HI> the Governour of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> that he should pull down the <HI>Jewish Temple</HI> that was there built long ago by <HI>Onias</HI> the Brother of the High-Priest; which he neglect∣ed to do, but only spoiled it of some of its Consecrated things, and so shut it up. But <HI>Paulinus,</HI> his Successor, having spoiled it of all its gifts, made an Order that none should presume to come to it; and so he put an end to the exercise of the Jewish Religion there, 343 years (as some compute) after that Temple was first built by <HI>Onias.</HI></P>
<P>A certain Jew, a Weaver, <HI>Jonathan</HI> by name, escaping to <HI>Cy∣rene,</HI> drew 2000 Jews to follow him into the Wilderness, pro∣mising to shew them <HI>signs</HI> and <HI>wonders;</HI> but by the chiefest of the Jews the matter being discovered to <HI>Catullus,</HI> Governour of those parts, he sent Soldiers, who slew most of them; and not long after, <HI>Jonathan</HI> himself was taken, who accused the most wealthy of the Jews (unjustly) to have had a hand in this Insurrection. To whose accusations <HI>Catullus</HI> willingly giving ear, put 3000 of them to the sword. And this he did with the greater confidence, be∣cause he confiscated their Estates to <HI>Caesar</HI>'s use. <HI>Jonathan</HI> he sent prisoner (with others that were taken) to <HI>Vespasian,</HI> that he might accuse the most honest of those Jews that lived at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Alex∣andria,</HI> as if they had held correspondence with him; yea, he af∣firmed, That <HI>Joseph</HI> the Writer of the Jewish History, sent to him
<PB N="464" REF="240"/> both Arms and Money. But <HI>Vespasian</HI> looking upon this as a false accusation, upon <HI>Titus</HI>'s entreaty acquitted these men, and deser∣vedly punished <HI>Jonathan,</HI> whom having whipped, he burnt alive. <HI>Catullus</HI> at present escaped through the mildness of the Emperor; but not long after, fell into grievous anguish of mind, and imagi∣ned he saw the Ghosts of those men he had so unjustly slain before his eyes. At last his <HI>guts</HI> and <HI>bowels</HI> issuing out of him, he died miserably.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Josephus</HI> endeth his History of the Destruction of <HI>Judea.</HI> But his <HI>Jewish Antiquities</HI> he finished not till the <HI>Thirteenth</HI> of <HI>Domitian,</HI> when he was Fifty six years old, as himself testifieth at the end of his Work.</P>
<P>I shall conclude all with an hearty Prayer to God for the <HI>Conversion of the Jews,</HI> and the <HI>Ʋnion of all Christians.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>O</HI> LORD, the Father of Mercies, let not thy indignation al∣ways burn against thy <HI>ancient people,</HI> nor cast them off for ever. Though the blood of thy dear Son, our blessed Saviour, lies heavy upon them, and hitherto thou hast justly hardned them; yet be pleased, of thy infinite mercy, to open their eyes, to unstop their ears, to mollifie their hearts, and to cause them to <HI>mourn over him whom their fore∣fathers pierced.</HI> Cause them to understand those <HI>Sacred Oracles</HI> which thou didst commit to their keeping; that our <HI>Saviour,</HI> who hath long since been <HI>a light to lighten the Gentiles, may,</HI> in thy due time, <HI>be the glory of thy people Israel;</HI> that so there may be but <HI>one Sheepfold,</HI> as there is but <HI>one Shepherd.</HI> For the speeding of their conversion, be pleased to compose the many <HI>differences</HI> that are among <HI>Christians;</HI> and so unite their disagreeing-affections, that our examples may no longer discourage, but may invite them to em∣brace our Lord and Saviour, and his blessed Doctrine. Cause thy <HI>Truth,</HI> O Lord, to shine forth gloriously and triumphantly, as the Sun at noon∣day; and let it dispel the thick mist of darkness and error that hath overspread so many Nations of the world; set up thy <HI>pure Worship,</HI> and thy <HI>own Institutions</HI> every where; and throw down <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>false worship</HI> where-ever it prevails. Break the yokes of <HI>oppression</HI> and <HI>violence,</HI> and rebuke the spirit of <HI>profaness, impiety, intem∣perance, ungodliness;</HI> and let <HI>holiness, righteousness, brotherly-kindness,</HI> and <HI>charity,</HI> prevail where-ever the Gospel of Christ is owned and professed. Ʋnite all Christians in those things that are the main <HI>fundamental</HI> Principles of the Christian Religion; and give them <HI>charity</HI> and <HI>mutual forbearance</HI> of each other in less important matters. Let all that name the Name of Christ, make conscience to depart from all iniquity, and live as becomes his disciples and ser∣vants. Grant this, O Lord, for thy own great Mercies, and our dear Saviour's Merits sake; To Whom, with thy Self, and Holy Spirit, be all Honour, Glory, Praise, Thanksgiving, and Sincere Obedience, ren∣dred now and for evermore. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q>
<CLOSER>Glory be to God in the Highest, on earth peace, good-will towards men.</CLOSER>
