<HEAD>THE City of BATH DESCRIBED.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He City of <HI>Bath</HI> is seated in the North North-East part of <HI>Somerset∣shire,</HI> environ'd (almost) all) round with pleasant and fruitful Hills full of excellent Springs of Waters, in so much as 'tis observed that on many of their Sumits, there are rare Christal Waters, gushing out especially in one Village adjoyning to the Southwards of it, there are near Fifty (if not more) Habitations, where scarce one House makes use of that Water that served another, each one enjoying a parti∣cular to its self.</P>
<P>The Valley in which it stands, in any place extends (hardly) it self to half a Mile in bredth, in most places less; it is very pleasant and fruitful, and therein hardly ever seen any Pools, Loughs, or Meery places; for as soon as any inundation is over, the Waters totally Drein away
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
with it, which doubtless contributes much to the Salu∣brity of the Air. From two of these Hills, the City (by Pipes of Lead) is not only plentifully served into the Common Conduits, but also not few of the private Houses are supplyed with it within their own Doors, such a Convenience, and at such easie Rates, that few places enjoy the like; and this being carried through most Streets, Lanes, and By-wayes, is not only for within∣door Occasions, but in case of Fire, is very ready to be made use of.</P>
<P>The Streets, most of the Narrowest size, especially that near the Center called <HI>Cheap-street,</HI> the greatest Eye∣sore of its Beauty and Cumber to its accommodation, it is Walled all round, with a Time-defying Stone, the Buildings (by strong supposition) mounted much higher then in former Ages; for walking round the Walls, it is perceivable, the City stands on a Batch (as we call it) in a bottom, from Fifteen to Twenty foot higher then the Surface without; neither is it without Suburbs, the fourth part supposed to be so, and all together, com∣puted by some that pretend to have calculated its Di∣mensions, takes not up much more then Fifty Acres, in such a narrow compass is this ancient, famous, little pretty City contained; which being in such a bottom, hath such a variety of Prospects, and Landskips, that few places parallel it, whereas places scited on Levels, seldom please the Eye far, deprived by the interposition of the next Pale, Wall, or Hedge, whereas, this raising it self higher then the adjoyning Gardens and Meadows, hath full and free passage, nor do the Hills so strengthen the Prospect, but that the Eye may even surfeit its self with variety of Objects (in some places) for at least three Miles, at once beholding the <HI>Meander-Aven</HI> Semi-circling the City, then the low Meadows, in several
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
small and great Partitions, the Pasture grounds above them, then the Corn fields, so gradually ye come up to the Downs, on which particularly <HI>Launsdown</HI> is an excellent Coarse of above two Miles, at the end whereof may be seen the City of <HI>Bristol,</HI> with the Counties of <HI>Somerset, Wilts, Glocester, Worcester, Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Men∣mouth;</HI> but this has made me endanger the Out-running my intended Discourse, seldom farther then the little City or its Prospect, but this Digression (I suppose) may not be much out of Order, when the Gallantry and Youth of the Nation, may be made acquainted, what Recrea∣tion the Vicinity of the place affords, especially when it is accompanied with Hunting, Setting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Wall is in compass not a full <HI>English</HI> Mile, and were the City not in such a bottom, and so over topped by Neighbouring Hills, by the Opinion of Col. <HI>B.</HI> (once Governor thereof) and some others, that may under∣stand Fortifications) might be made Tenable, for indeed the whole, is but one entire Rampart, a Coffin fill'd with Earth, on which the Buildings are; then the Springs so near the Superficies, that no Approaches can be made but with great difficulty, there are large discourses already extant of several Statues, Figures, as Gorgons Ser∣pents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in it, in which I shall not meddle, but leave every man to his view, and belief, but certainly this, it is a Noble Ancient Wall therein appearing many antiquities, as also four Gates, having their several denominations from the four Cardinal winds, which every night are or∣der'd to be lock'd up, and a Watch Itinerant, Sworn not to enter any House till four in the Morn, which how duely observed, some of them who have been caught tardy, and put into Wooden Bastile, for their pains can satisfie you.</P>
<P>The Government is by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Twenty Councellors or Citizens. The Mayor and Alder∣men
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
(on solemn dayes) are in Scarlet, the number (by Charter) may not exceed eleven, nor under five; to these is added a Recorder, who there with the Mayor is Justice of the Peace and <HI>Quorum,</HI> having the precedence of the two other Justices; also a Town Clark, who every Leet-day (twice in the year) calls the Court, and it is kept in his Name, although Mayor, Aldermen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> present.</P>
<P>And here (I conceive it will not be improper, no Sally from the purpose, to observe the care here taken for the Poor, of which quality (I suppose) there are fewer then in any place (for its bigness) in the Kingdom, the yearly rate for the three Parishes, being under 30 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> which to some Strangers, hath, not being acquainted with the Custom and Method here taken) seem'd wonderful, most People conjecturing the City to be poor, (as indeed it cannot vaunt of many notoriously rich) yet Providence, with the beneficent munificence of some of our <HI>English</HI> Monarques hath sufficiently provided for it, thereby they owing as little to their backs and bellies as any place I know of, yet no stupid Gormandizers neither; for such care is taken that the wealthier sort eat their own Mor∣sels, free from such importunate Clamours and Out∣cries as are too frequently seen in other places, that have a higher Celebration for Riches, this principally arising (without doubt) from Magistratical care, at every Quar∣ter-Sale day wherein the poorer sort are not only kindly used (beyond comparison) but are also so tyed up, that they cannot squander away their good bargains, but are reserved in case of necessity to their needy Families.</P>
<P>It is supplied and adorned for the Service of God with three Churches, dedicated to St. <HI>James,</HI> St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> the later justly challenging to its self the preheminence, for lightsomness, stateliness, and ele∣gance
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
of Structure, of all the Parochial Churches in the Kingdom, the Tower whereof is 162 foot high, in the upper loft whereof, is a noble Taunting, and Musical ring of Bells, whose loud Peals have been distinctly heard five, six, nay sometimes seven Miles distant. The Tenor is called <HI>Hopton;</HI> mostly the gift of that Honorable Family, what wanted in their bounty, was supplyed by the City; to this Tower are four several Stair-Cases, at each distinct corner one. This Stately Pile was begun in <HI>Henry</HI> the Sevenths time by one <HI>Oliver King,</HI> the then Bishop of the Diocess, but never (by the iniquity of the times partly arising by the several changes) could it arise to any perfection, till about the year 1606. God raised up Bishop <HI>Montague,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Bellot,</HI> and other pious and generous Benefactors, by whose great bounty and good Example it now enjoys its present Splendor and Glory. In the Body whereof one thing is most remarkable, that although it be of a vast Dimension taking its height, bredth, and length, and lying unco∣vered for above 100 years, the Windows so large, the Walls so thin, (that I presume many Mansion-houses equal it) yet this Noble Pile, notwithstanding it hath no sloaping Buttresses, on the outside to support and streng∣then it, which the great Churches usually have, shews no Flaw, Crack, not settling, but stands firm and en∣tire, evidencing thereby, not only the profound Skill of the Architect, but the goodness of the Stone, whose quality is, when taken up green out of the Quarry, of such a softness, that a Pen-knife (comparatively) may work it, without turning its edge, but when exposed to any building in the open Air, nothing more lasting, nothing more permanent, for neither Age nor time can deface it, witness the whole Pile, which notwithstanding it hath stood near two Centuries, yet to this day, remains as
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
firm and beautiful as at first, near the midst whereof, under an Arch to the Northward, lyes interred the Noble and Charitable Benefactor Bishop <HI>Montague,</HI> on whom his Executors (his Brothers) men of great Honor and Places, rear'd a stately Monument, answerable to the Dignity of that Honourable and Religious Prelate, over against this Noble Monument, the City in Testimony of the respects they owed to the then Rector Mr. <HI>John Pelling</HI> erected another to him, this Reverend Divine, notwith∣standing he had a numerous Issue; yet was so indefatigably zealous in forwarding the reparation of this Fabrick, that when at any time (and that was not seldom in that gene∣rous and benefactory Age) any Persons of Honour offer'd to him, as to his private, refused it with his, <HI>Non mihi sed Ecclesiae,</HI> which occasion'd that Motto over his Tomb, which self-denyal (its possible) the good God hath (se∣condarily paid into his own bosom, by a blessing on his Posterity, who (some of them especially) notwithstanding the few mites they had to begin the World, have now the value of Talents in their Possession; but this I take notice of, only for the Readers satisfaction, not for other Ministers Imitation.</P>
<P>In the South-east Isle, is a pretty, somewhat stately, and doubt less conceited Monument, all of Free-stone, having Originally no Inscription, as to time, person, or quality, therefore vulgarly called the <HI>Speechless Monu∣ment,</HI> but now not so, for although the Tenant was (possibly) not willing to have any, yet the will of the Dead, as to that particular is sufficiently broken, for on the ground are many Stones, curiously and artificially Joyned together, these make the resemblance of a copped Chest, and is in length, bredth, and height, sufficient to receive an Ordinary Corps; but it seems it was not the receptacle, if you believe the Scribled Inscription.</P>
<Q><PB N="7" REF="7"/>

<L>Fancy may think one hid within this Tomb,</L>
<L>But reason sayes his grave was Mothers Womb.</L>

<Q><LG>
<L>Nameless not Fameless, here one lyes,</L>

<P>That was answered thus,</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Nameless then Fameless, for how can Fame</L>
<L>Attend that man that wants a known-by Name?</L>
<L><HI>Anonymus</HI> here might very well share Fame</L>

<L>Then Name makes fame, and nothing else for Fame</L>
<L>'S no more in sense then a Recorded Name.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>But to prevent all future defacings by such scribling and scratching, one (it seems) had been so far acquainted with the name and quality of the there interred, that for these many years he hath silenc'd such Enormities by this Divulgation to the World.</P>

<P>Near over against this Monument is a neat little Chap∣pel, under an Arch between the Isle and the Chancel, (where formerly sate persons of the greater quality) some of which (I suppose) though much of it is not so; for curiosity in Stonework, is hardly to be match'd in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>

<P>But since I am on Fancies, I must not leave this Church without a Recital of some others in the Windows, num∣bred in all to 52. most given by Strangers Benefactors (of which and all other charitable Donations there is a Vellum-Record on purpose kept in the Library) The great Window in the Chancel (where there is a greater in all dimensions I am yet to seek) was totally the Gift of that worthy forenamed Gentleman Mr. <HI>Thomas Bellot</HI> fan∣cying his name, being party-colour'd quarrels of Glass laid Bellot-wise one over and cross the other. There are three others (though of smaller value) one given by Mr. <HI>Malet</HI> of <HI>Enmore,</HI> with his Coat of Arms and Motto, <HI>Malet Meliora.</HI> Another by Mr. <HI>Biss</HI> of <HI>Spargrove,</HI> with his Coat and Motto, <HI>Bis feelt sis foelix Bis:</HI> the third a Citizen of <HI>London</HI> who although (peradventure) he was not so accoutred from his Ancestors; yet his generous liberality was equal in the Charge to the others (unless the Coat made a difference) for a Window he gave of the same magnitude, with his fancy of <HI>William Plumby, Here I was, This I did.</HI></P>
<P>I must not omit speaking somewhat of the Revenue of this Church, which indeed is but small, and that which is and hath been the Gifts of Protestant Benefactors, among whom, Dame <HI>Elizabeth Booth</HI> the Ancestors of that Noble and fully accomplish'd Gentleman the Lord <HI>de la▪ Mere,</HI> exceeded all the Sons and Daughters of our <HI>Israel,</HI> by whose pious bounty (with some additions the
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
City made) there is purchased in Land, to the yearly value of near 20 l. <HI>per annum,</HI> this seems but a small main∣tenance for so great a Building, yet with this, and with what else doth arise by breaking ground for Burial places, and for Monuments, it is as well kept in Repair as any Church I know of.</P>
<P>But before I leave this Church, I shall leave with you these few observations; First, that not any one (that I know of) not of the Religion professed and establish'd, gave one peny towards its Reparation; Next for the ho∣nour of our Fathers, they were the Repairers, and that in the last place We their Survivours may not be branded of having so much Faith, that we have lost all Good Works, continue the Reparation, and that not Niggardly neither; of which those famous Battlements and Pinacles, almost round, gives sufficient and pregnant Evidence.</P>
<P>And now having done your Devotions, it is time I lead you to the Kings Bath, where as soon as you come down the great Stairs, you may behold the Stone-pavement and Battlements quite round it, the bounty of Sir <HI>Francis Stonor</HI> of <HI>Stonor;</HI> and for that I have had some Reflections on Protestant Benefactors on the Church to give each Perswasion its due, this Gentleman was a Romanist, may not this therefore argue for them, that although they may be no Friends to the Church, yet they may be to the State▪ And now behold one of the greatest Mira∣cles in Nature: The Universe (by Travellers general report) not affording the like, whose Waters, (granted by all hands to be as old as the Creation, keeping con∣stantly one quantity and quality in the greatest Drought, not one drop less in appearance, nor in the greatest Flouds or Innundation any the More, experimentally made true by this unquestionable Evidence, the Waters filling it up to the usual height, which when the Sluces are carefully
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
and exactly stopped, whether Summer or Winter, Drought or Floud, makes not one Minutes difference; so that Dame <HI>Luna,</HI> that Puling Piss-Kitchin Planet with her Ebbings and Flowings, her Nepes and Spring-tides, hath no influence at all here, and no more then Reason, for these Waters all along have been and are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Anciently the Cities Name.</NOTE> <HI>Aquae Solis,</HI> so <HI>Sol</HI> is solely predominant here, and Lord Paramount, whereby we are assured they partake of no other accidental Increase, by any Spring or soaking to contaminate, defile or dis-vertue it, which the cold Waters of <HI>Tunbridge, Epsom, Barnet,</HI> &amp;c. cannot appropriate to themselves, if general report be true, they increasing and decreasing, according to Acci∣dent and Season; but of this no more till I come to hint, and but to hint of them in another place.</P>
<P>Now the quantity of these Waters arising in the Kings Bath (there are none in the Queens although they are contiguous) may (as is supposed) very well drive an Over-shot Mill, and the quality is as constant as the quan∣tity, the Springs at their Ebullitions, as hot in <HI>December</HI> as in <HI>June,</HI> and therefore may (with some more care for prevention of taking Cold) be with much efficacy used in all Seasons of the year, which is very fit should be taken notice of, to remove a Vulgar Error, That these Waters are never useful nor seasonable but in the Summer.</P>
<P>Among the many Springs in the Kings Bath, there is a principal one called the Hot-Spring, which is received by its self (without Communication into a lead Cistern, and that so close, that it is impossible any Drop of the other Waters can intermingle, over this Spring and Cistern, is (by the Order and Direction of an Honorable and Famous Physitian, a pump erecting, so that the Waters from its single Effluence shall by three several Convey∣ances, be distributed abroad in wonderful quantities, in∣somuch,
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
that although the three pumps should be in per∣petual agitation, yet this noble, and exuberant Spring will remain inexhaustible, the Vertues whereof Fame (warranted by Experience) hath justly Trumpetted forth to the world, insomuch, that they are not only made use of in the Bath, the several places of the City, and Neighborhood, but also in Bottles and Runlets at <HI>Bristol, Glocester, Worcester,</HI> nay, <HI>London</HI> it self. Among many its vertues, I shall give you an accompt of but a few, Take your proportion in the Morn, whether two, three, or more quarts, as may be prescribed you, for four, five, or six hours after you have drank them, you have no Thirst, whereas formerly, when they were not taken inwardly, the Bathers were so greatly afflicted with it, that many times weak heads have been near an intoxica∣tion in only endeavouring by taking in other potable Li∣quor (moderately) to quench it, and all the times these Soveraign Waters are in your body, although they may give you several Stools, yet it is without any rumbling in your body, or Laceration of your Guts, having a gentle and painless Operation, both by Urine and Siege; the Concomitant whereof is an excellent Stomach, much better'd by walking and stirring your body after the drinking them, and still as your body empties, you may continue drinking more, the Waters being so innocent, that it is seldom or never heard, any complaint that a great quantity injured any one, and now (as I said before) they are never out of season, for that Stately new erected Cross in the Kings Bath is a defence and shelter as well from Winters blasts as Summers Sun, and there are many con∣venient Rooms for drinking of, and bathing in them, which may invite those that have occasion to make use of them at any season, especially since I shall give them this assurance, that although there may be to Winter-Bathers
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
more expence in fuel, yet to recompence that, their Lodgings will be cheaper, and the Inhabitants are obser∣ved to be as active in their attendance, and as ready to take your Money, in hoary <HI>December,</HI> as in fragrant <HI>June.</HI> This being granted, I have often wonder'd so much peo∣ple have neglected a suddain Repair hither, but to the loss of many of their Lives, Limbs, or both; have delayed so long, and tamper'd so much, by taking undue cour∣ses in other places, that many times, when they come hither, they are so far past all hopes, that nothing but a Miracle can cure them, whereas seldom or never, any part hence (that make early Application) without some comfort, if not perfect cure or recovery. I cannot play the Emperick to tell you all the Maladies, and Diseases by Potion and Lotion they are effectually good for, only this (to my own knowledge) they are (in some consti∣tutions) good against, and for avoiding the very Stone, of which there are proofs sufficient, among the many this one, The dearest Relation of the Author of these papers, was extreamly tormented with it for some years, never could she find any ease or comfort by any Skill or Direction of the ablest Physitian, till the great Physitian was pleased to put it into her head to make use of the Bath; which in three or four times using, by bathing and drinking, divers Stones came from her, and that only in the time of her Bathing, and drinking, some where∣of as big as Olive-Stones are yet in my Custody, and from that time to her dying day, (which was some years) was never troubled with it afterwards. For other ordinary Diseases, as <HI>Palsie, Dropsie, Sciatica, Rickets,</HI> and the like, the numberless number of Crutches that have from time to time been left behind, is a sufficient Testimony, some whereof yet hung up, remain as Tro∣phies of Gods Mercies in their several Cures.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="10"/>And now in this place (according to my promise) and purpose) I shall speak somewhat of the Cold Waters of <HI>Tunbridge, Epsom,</HI> &amp;c. so much celebrated and drank of in and about <HI>London,</HI> wherein because I may be thought partial, I shall speak the less, in which let me desire an Observation whether or no since the drinking those Wa∣ters have been so much in use. <HI>The Griping of the Guts,</HI> a not only painful torturing, but Mortal Malady, hath not been more frequent now then in former times, it is easily found to be so by examination of the Weekly Bills, which plainly evidences, that of late more have been cast over the Perch, by this doleful Disease in one year, then (giving allowance also for the growth of the City too proportionably) in former Ages in seven, and those that will not appropriate that single Disease, besides some others that may be attributed to those Waters, are in their understandings (I humbly conceive) blind or wilfully obstinate, indeed how can it be otherwise but those cold and crude Springs, with their Nauseous soakings (so averse to our <HI>English,</HI> and all Northern Constitutions) lying so long in the Stomach, but must oppress, chill it, and destroy the Appetite, especially since it is granted there is many times a mixture of Rain waters, soaking through the several crannies of the Earth into them, ad∣ding an increase by Urine and Ordure, Humane and Bel∣luine, plentifully shed thereabouts; so that the Physick makes the Excrement, and (<HI>Vicissim</HI>) the Excrement the Physick, certainly it is so, those Springs being observed to be far more fluent in wet and cold Summers, then in the hot and dry, then if compounded Rain-waters, and such Soakings are of such vertues I suppose they may be had nearer home, but it can never win belief with me, that the drinking them is the sole Reason and Occasion of the great resort thither; no, doubtless there is something else

in it Meetings; which if so, they that go thither on that Errand, do not amiss, let them enjoy and solace them∣selves there, no hurt, but when they are there, to drink the waters in such a prodigious manner and measure through wantonness, custom, or example, can by no man wishing well to the Nation be approved of. But <HI>Si Po∣pulus vult perire, quis vetet?</HI> Sure this I am, that not above two or three years since, some sixteen miles distant from this City at a place called <HI>Alford,</HI> there was such another Spring found out, as I now am discoursing of; never was there a greater resort to any place (considering the small quantities of Waters it produced) then thither so much reputation it had gained that much people had the patience to stay their turns (for Gods mercies were much seen in that it was a (pitifully) barren Spring) till they could be supplyed from the Well. This was then (for that year only, for never before, nor never after, that I ever could here of (it having (paid the Drinkers off, sufficiently) was it made use of) the <HI>English Bethesda,</HI> but it was not the Angel of the Lord that stirred those Wa∣ters, but an evil one; found so, by the Diseases and Mortality that seized on abundance of People, in a very short time after they had drank them; insomuch, that ever since there is a <HI>Lord have Mercy</HI> written on the Door of him that made Merchandize of them.

<P><PB N="15" REF="11"/>To conclude, what I have said of the King and Queens Baths, I would be understood as to their Vertues (<HI>Con∣junctim aut divisim</HI>) to be said of all. Only this, The Springs of the Cross Bath are not so hot as the Kings, nor so fluent; neither those in the Hot Bath, the distin∣ction being given it, in reference (only) that it is hotter the adjoyning Cross Bath; all which Baths are so surroun∣ded with such Noble Buildings for Reception, that they appear (in respect of other places so remote from the Me∣tropolis) rather petty Palaces, then common Lodgings, Summ'd up in a pair of Heroicks by the Author hereof near an Age since, and may now with Candour seem no vain glory, or impertinence, to be inserted here, since they no wayes Hyperbolize the Convenience, Gallantry, nor Vertues of the Baths, nor City; and being both made on accident not design, vindicates the Honour of our <HI>English</HI> Tongue, having fewer Letters in our own then the Latine, and yet as full significant and expressive as that.</P>
