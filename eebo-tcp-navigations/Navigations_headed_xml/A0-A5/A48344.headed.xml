<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving heretofore published to the World severall <HI>Treatises</HI> tending to the Practice of the <HI>Sciences Mathematicall;</HI> as, my <HI>Arithmetick</HI> in Four Parts, 1. <HI>Vulgar,</HI> 2. <HI>Decimal,</HI> 3. <HI>Instrumental,</HI> and 4. <HI>Alge∣braicall;</HI> my <HI>Arithmeticall Recreations;</HI> my <HI>Ʋse of the Line of Proportion made easie; the Ʋse of Napiers Bones;</HI> my <HI>Compleat Surveyor;</HI> my <HI>Platform for Purchasers, Guide for Builders,</HI> and <HI>Mate for Measures,</HI> &amp;c. All which have found good acceptance in the World, as may appear by the severall <HI>Editions</HI> which some of them have passed the Press: I thought good at length to publish something that might be <HI>usefull</HI> and <HI>beneficial</HI> for my <HI>Country-men, English Navigators;</HI> hoping that I shall receive from them (for the pains I have already, and hereafter shall take for their good and advantage) no less En∣couragement by their acceptance of what (out of free good will) I tender to them, then I have already from others, for what I have made publick for their Use and Service.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Nine</HI> following <HI>Treatises</HI> I have furnished the <HI>Young Sea-man</HI> with such practical <HI>Exercises</HI> as tend wholly to his <HI>Em∣ployment</HI> at <HI>Sea:</HI> beginning, first, with some few <HI>Geometricall Rudiments</HI> that are absolutely necessary for him to understand and be perfect in the Practice of, before he launch farther into the <HI>Mathematicall Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>From these <HI>Elements,</HI> I proceed to the <HI>Geometricall Dimen∣sion</HI> of <HI>Triangles</HI> both <HI>Plain</HI> and <HI>Sphericall,</HI> upon the <HI>Solution</HI>
<PB REF="4"/> whereof all the <HI>Practick Parts</HI> of the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> do depend. For on the <HI>Solution</HI> of <HI>Right-lined Triangles,</HI> all <HI>Propositions</HI> which concern <HI>Longimetria,</HI> or the Measuring of <HI>Heights, Depths</HI> and <HI>Distances,</HI> either upon the <HI>Land</HI> or at <HI>Sea;</HI> all in <HI>Planometria,</HI> as Measuring of <HI>Land, Board, Glass, Pavements, Hangings,</HI> &amp;c. all in <HI>Striometria,</HI> or the Mensuration of <HI>Solids,</HI> such as <HI>Stone, Timber,</HI> and the like; all Problems of <HI>Sailing,</HI> both by the <HI>Plain Sea-Chart,</HI> and also by that of <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Projection; all that concerns <HI>Fortification, Gunnery,</HI> &amp;c. have their depen∣dence.—And by the <HI>Solution</HI> of <HI>Sphericall Triangles, Problems</HI> in <HI>Astronomie, Geography, Sailing by the Arch of a great Circle, Dialling,</HI> Measuring of the Distance of <HI>Stars, Comets,</HI> &amp;c. are to be resolved.</P>
<P><HI>Trigonometria,</HI> therefore, being the <HI>Basis</HI> or <HI>Foundation</HI> upon which the forementioned <HI>Superstructures</HI> are <HI>erected;</HI> I chose first to begin with that. And how I have performed it, and to what Uses I have applied it, which tend to the Practice of <HI>the Art of Navigation,</HI> the <HI>Contents</HI> of the severall <HI>Exercises</HI> will (in part) declare.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Geometricall resolving</HI> of <HI>Triangles</HI> both <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>sphe∣ricall,</HI> I have gone in a <HI>Path</HI> not before <HI>beaten.</HI> And therefore, if I have at any time gone out of my way, either by <HI>deficiency</HI> or <HI>redundancy,</HI> I hope the <HI>Reader</HI> will pardon me. I am sure the ingenious <HI>Mathematician</HI> (who (at first sight) will discover the manner and waies of Working, and also the Ground and De∣monstration thereof) will not <HI>carp</HI> or <HI>cavilat,</HI> but rather in∣form <HI>me</HI> or the <HI>Reader</HI> of any such <HI>Deviation.</HI> But in the Pur∣suance of every <HI>Exercise,</HI> I have therein retained such a <HI>Me∣thod,</HI> that I could not well step aside. And for the certainty of the manner of the <HI>Geometricall Operations,</HI> (if they be carefully performed) I dare aver that you may (if the Radius of your Line of Chords be but 4 or 5 <HI>Inches</HI>) come within a few Mi∣nutes of Calculation; which will be sufficient for the <HI>Sea-man's Ʋse,</HI> for him thereby to resolve such <HI>Problems</HI> in <HI>Astronomie, Geography</HI> or <HI>Navigation,</HI> as at any time he shall (in his Practice)
<PB REF="4"/> have occasion for. And that Proof or Triall may be made thereof, (though I could in a few Lines demonstrate the nature and manner of Working) I have to every <HI>Case, Proposition</HI> and <HI>Problem</HI> in the whole <HI>Work</HI> contained, added the <HI>Analogies</HI> or <HI>Proportions</HI> by which they may be <HI>solved</HI> by the <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>Ar∣tificial Sines</HI> and <HI>Tangents,</HI> and the <HI>Chiliads</HI> of <HI>Logarithms:</HI> So that such as have those Tables (and know their Use) may work any <HI>Proposition</HI> by them, and by that discover the Diffe∣rence between <HI>Calculation</HI> and this <HI>Geometricall</HI> way of <HI>Opera∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>And that the <HI>young Sea-man</HI> may not (at any time) be to seek of <HI>Tools</HI> to work with, (in case of any Miscarriage at Sea) I have not onely shewed him how to <HI>use,</HI> but also the manner how to <HI>make,</HI> all such <HI>Instruments</HI> as will be in use to him in the Practice of these <HI>Exercises:</HI> As of his <HI>Line of Chords,</HI> which is the chief; and also of a <HI>Sea-Chart</HI> according to <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Pro∣jection, without the help of a <HI>Table</HI> of <HI>Meridionall Parts,</HI> or a <HI>Meridian Line,</HI> but <HI>easily</HI> and <HI>speedily</HI> by a <HI>Line of Chords</HI> onely; and that either <HI>General,</HI> from the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> towards either <HI>Pole;</HI> or <HI>Particular,</HI> for any designed <HI>Navigation.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, in the Working of the severall <HI>Questions</HI> by <HI>Mer∣cator</HI>'s <HI>Chart,</HI> I have, at the end of every <HI>Problem,</HI> given an ac∣count of the Difference arising between Working by that and the <HI>Plain Sea-Chart;</HI> whereby the <HI>Errours</HI> of the one are clearly detected, and the <HI>Verity</HI> of the other discovered.</P>
<P>I might have proceeded farther, to the performance of other things by the <HI>Line of Chords</HI> onely; as to shew the manner of <HI>Sailing</HI> by the <HI>Arch of a great Circle:</HI> but that, with some other things tending to <HI>Navigation,</HI> I shall shortly make publick in a <HI>Treatise</HI> formerly written by my self and Mr. <HI>Vincent Wing,</HI> now in my hands, and almost ready for the <HI>Press,</HI> and wholly design∣ed for the Use of <HI>Sea-men.</HI>—And for farther Use of this Line, I have in a Treatise (now in the Press) taught the manner how to delineate all manner of <HI>Sun-Dials</HI> by <HI>projecting</HI> of the <HI>Sphere in Plano,</HI> whereby not onely the <HI>Making,</HI> but the <HI>Reason</HI> also, of
<PB REF="5"/> <HI>Dials</HI> is discovered. To which Treatise (if my present occasi∣ons will permit) I shall adde both an Arithmeticall and an In∣strumentall way of <HI>Dialling</HI> also.</P>
<P>Thus, friendly Reader, at present, I present thee with This; and in a few Months thou shalt (God willing) participate of those above mentioned. All which I hope will be as kindly accepted, as they are freely tendered by</P>

<HEAD>How to make a Line of Chords.</HEAD>
<P>ACcording to the largeness of your <HI>Line of Chords</HI> you intend to make, draw a right Line, as A B, and upon the Point A (by the II. Prop.) erect the Perpendicu∣lar A C, and upon A (as a Centre) describe the <HI>Quadrant</HI> B D E C, which you must divide into 90 equal parts or <HI>De∣grees.</HI> Which that you may readily doe, your Compasses being opened to the distance A B, set one foot in B, and the other will reach to E; also set one foot in C, and the o∣ther will reach to D: so is your <HI>Quadrant</HI> divided in∣to three equal parts, each part containing 30 degr. This done, divide each of these three parts into three more; so shall you have divided your <HI>Quadrant</HI> in∣to 9 equal parts, each con∣taining 10 degr. and each of these 9 parts, being di∣vided into halves, will con∣tain 5 degr. and (if you make your Line large enough) you must divide those into 5 equal parts, which you may very well doe, if the Line A B be but two inches long, as all the <HI>Schemes</HI> and <HI>Figures</HI> in these <HI>Exercises</HI> are drawn by a <HI>Line of Chords</HI> of that length.</P>

<P>Your <HI>Quadrant</HI> being thus divided into 90 degr. draw the Line B C, and parallel thereto two other Lines, one pretty close to B C, to contain the small Divisions, and the other at a larger distance, to set the Figures in. Now it is the Line B C which is called the <HI>Line of Chords,</HI> (possibly for this Reason,

And if your Line be very large, you may doe so to every single degree, and part of a degree.

<P N="1">1. A Triangle is a Figure consisting of three Sides, and as many Angles; as is the Figure C A B.</P>
<P N="2">2. Any two Sides of a Triangle are called the Sides of the Angle contained by them; as the Sides C B, and A B, are the Sides containing the Angle C B A.</P>
<P N="3">3. The measure of an Angle is the quantity of the Arch of a Circle, described upon the angular Point, and cutting both the Sides containing the Angle. As in the Triangle A C B, the Arch <HI>f g</HI> is the measure of the Angle at C, the Arch <HI>d e</HI> is the measure of the Angle at B, and the Angle at A is a right Angle containing 90 degr.</P>

<P N="5">5. A Semicircle con∣tains 180 degr. And</P>
<P N="6">6. A Quadrant (or right Angle) contains 90 degr.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Complement of an Angle less then 90 degr. is so much as that Angle wanteth of 90 deg.
<PB N="13" REF="12"/> As the Angle A C B of the Triangle containeth 53 degr. 7. min. the Complement whereof is 36 degr. 53 min. which is so much as 53 degr. 7 min. wanteth of 90 degr. For if you subtract 53 degr. 37 min. from 90 degr. (or from 89 degr. 60 min. for ease in subtracting) the remainder will be 36 degr. 53 min.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Complement of an Angle to a Semicircle is so much as that Angle wanteth of 180 degr. So the Angle C being 53 degr. 7 min. take 53 degr. 7 min. from 180 degr. (or from 179 degr. 60 min.) and the remainder will be 126 degr. 53 min. which is the Complement of the Angle C to 180 degr.</P>
<P N="9">9. An Angle is either right, acute, or obtuse.</P>
<P N="10">10. A Right Angle is that whose measure is 90 degr. or a Quadrant.</P>
<P N="11">11. An Acute Angle is less then a right Angle, and alwaies contains less then 90 degr.</P>
<P N="12">12. An Obtuse Angle is greater then a right Angle, and al∣waies contains more then 90 degr.</P>
<P N="13">13. A Triangle is either right-angled, or oblique-angled.</P>
<P N="14">14. A right-angled Triangle is such a Triangle as hath one right Angle. As the Triangle C A B hath one right Angle, namely, that at A, which containeth just 90 degr.</P>
<P N="15">15. In every right-angled Triangle, that Side which sub∣tendeth (or lieth opposite to) the right Angle is called the <HI>Hypotenuse;</HI> and of the other two Sides the one is called the Perpendicular, and the other the Base, at pleasure: But most commonly the shorter side is called the Perpendicular, and the longer the Base. Thus in the Triangle C B A, B C is the Hypotenuse, C A the Perpendicular, and A B the Base.</P>
<P N="16">16. In every right-angled Triangle, if you have one of the acute Angles given, the other is also given, it being the Complement thereof to 90 degr. As in the Triangle C A B, if you have the Angle at C 53 degr. 7 min. given, you have also the Angle at B given, it being the Complement of that at C to 90 degr. wherefore take 53 degr. 7 min. from
<PB N="14" REF="13"/> 90 degr. and there will remain 36 degr. 53 min. which is the quantity of the Angle at B.</P>
<P N="17">17. In all right-lined Triangles whatsoever, (either right-angled or oblique-angled) the three Angles together are
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>geometrical diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> equal to two right Angles, or contain 180 degr. Therefore, if you have any two Angles of a Triangle given, you have also the third given, it being the Complement of the other two to 180 degr.—Thus in the Triangle C D B, if there were given the Angle C D B 43 degr. 20 min. and the Angle C B D 14 degr. 40 min. I say, by consequence you have the third Angle D C B also given, it being the Complement of the other two to 180 degr. For the two given Angles B D C 43 degr. 20 min. and C B D 14 degr. 40 min. being added together, make 58 degr. which being taken from 180 degr. there will remain 122 degr. the quantity of the obtuse Angle D C B.</P>
<P N="18">18. In all Triangles whatsoever, the Sides are in proportion one to the other as the Sines of the Angles opposite to those Sides. So in the Triangle C D B, the Sine of the Angle at D is the proportion to the Side C B, which is opposite to it; as the Sine of the Angle at B is to the Side C D, or the Angle at C to the Side D B.</P>

And if in the wor∣king of any of the <HI>Cases</HI> there be any difficulty, it is <HI>in the moving of the Compasses along one Line, while the other foot, being turned about, doth only touch another Line.</HI> But this is not a real, but a seeming, difficulty; for in <HI>3</HI> or <HI>4</HI> times trial you will finde it very expeditious and easie: and although it be not so Geometricall as the way by drawing of Parallels, yet it is alto∣gether as exact; more ready and speedy in performance, and avoids the drawing of multiplicity of Lines, which would much cumber the Diagrams to no purpose. If the Schemes that are here drawn seem to be cumbred with multiplicity of Lines, the reason is, because many of them serve for <HI>3, 4,</HI> or <HI>5 Cases;</HI> but if a particular Diagram had been drawn for every <HI>Case,</HI> then none of them would have consisted of above <HI>5</HI> Lines besides the Quadrant, as you will see by trying of any <HI>Case.</HI> And here note, that every one of these <HI>Cases,</HI> both in <HI>Right-lined</HI> and <HI>Sphericall Triangles,</HI> is applicable to some one thing or other in the Practice of the <HI>Mathematicks.</HI> As, by <HI>plain Right-lined Tri∣angles</HI> all Propositions are resolved that concern the taking of <HI>Heights, Depths</HI> and <HI>Distances, Measuring</HI> of <HI>Land, Sailing</HI> by the <HI>plain Sea-Chart,</HI> and also by <HI>Mercator</HI>'s, and divers other particulars.

<P>Secondly, (because the <HI>Latitude</HI> of the place for which you draw your <HI>Projection,</HI> viz. <HI>London,</HI> is 51 degr. 30 min.) take 51 degr. 30 min. from your Line of Chords, and set them upon the <HI>Meridian</HI> from Z to AE, and from N to <HI>ae,</HI> and draw

<PB N="79" REF="45"/> and (because this <HI>Hour-Circle</HI> is distant from the <HI>Me∣ridian</HI> 62 degr. 46 min.) take 62 degr. 46 min. from your Line of Chords, and set them upon the Quadrant A B C, from C to <HI>l,</HI> and draw the Line A <HI>l m.</HI> So shall the Line A <HI>l m</HI> be the Semidiameter of the <HI>Hour-Circle</HI> P B S; which being taken in your Compasses, and set upon your Projection from B, upon the Line B AE, (being extended,) shall there give you the Cen∣tre of that <HI>Hour-Circle.</HI> And in the same manner may the Centres of all the rest be found.</P>
<P>Sixthly, the <HI>Azimuth Circles</HI> are to be drawn upon the Pro∣jection, and the Centres of them found in all respects as the <HI>Hour-Circles</HI> were.—So the <HI>Azimuth Circle</HI> Z ☉ N, being 56 degr. 40 min. from the <HI>Meridian,</HI> take 56 degr. 41 min. out of your Line of Chords, and set them upon the <HI>Meridian</HI> of your Projection from O to <HI>d;</HI> then laying a Ruler unto Z and <HI>d,</HI> it will cut the <HI>Horizon</HI> in the Point ☉ through which the <HI>Azimuth</HI> of 56 degr. 41 min. Z ☉ N, must pass.—Then, to find its Centre, repair to the former Scheme for finding of Centres, and upon the Quadrant A B C set 56 degr. 41 min. of your Chords, from C to <HI>n,</HI> and draw the Line A <HI>u o:</HI> so shall the Line A <HI>u o</HI> be the Semidiameter of the <HI>Azimuth Circle</HI> Z ☉ N; which being taken in your Compasses, and set upon your Projection from ☉, upon the Line ☉ H, (being extended,) shall there give you the Centre of the <HI>Azimuth Circle</HI> Z ☉ N. And in this manner may the Centre of any other <HI>Azimuth Circle</HI> be found.</P>
<P>And here note (I.) <HI>That the Centres of all</HI> Azimuth Circles <HI>fall in the</HI> Horizon <HI>H A D, being extended where need is. The Centres of all the</HI> Hour-Circles <HI>fall in the</HI> Aequinoctial <HI>Line AE A ae, being extended. The Centres of the</HI> Tropicks <HI>and</HI> Par∣allels <HI>of</HI> Declination <HI>fall in the</HI> Axis of the World <HI>P A S, ex∣tended. And the Centres of the Circles of</HI> Altitude <HI>fall in the</HI> Prime Verticall <HI>Circle Z A N.</HI></P>
<P>Note (II.) <HI>That if the middle Point of any</HI> Hour-Circle <HI>do not fall just in the</HI> Aequinoctial, <HI>or any</HI> Azimuth Circle <HI>just in
<PB N="80" REF="46"/> the</HI> Horizon, <HI>but on either side of them; then you may find the Centres by the</HI> Geometricall Propositions <HI>at the beginning of this Book; though there be other waies to find the Centres upon the</HI> Projection <HI>it self, which I omit, for that I would not cumber the Scheme with unnecessary Lines.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly, Every Circle in the Projection hath its proper <HI>Pole,</HI> as was before intimated. Now for the finding of them, you are to note, that the <HI>Pole</HI> of every <HI>great Circle</HI> is 90 degr. or a <HI>Quadrant</HI> of a Circle, distant from the Circle it self, upon that Line which cutteth the Circle at right Angles. Thus the <HI>Poles</HI> of all the <HI>Hour-Circles</HI> are upon the <HI>Aequinoctial,</HI> and the <HI>Poles</HI> of all the <HI>Azimuths</HI> upon the <HI>Horizon.</HI>—Now if you would find the <HI>Pole</HI> of the <HI>Hour-Circle</HI> P D S, lay a Ruler up∣on P and D, and it will cut the <HI>Meridian</HI> Circle in <HI>e:</HI> then take 90 degr. of your Line of Chords, and set them from <HI>e</HI> to <HI>f,</HI> a Ruler laid from P to <HI>f</HI> will cut the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> in Y: so is Y the <HI>Pole</HI> of the <HI>Hour-Circle</HI> P D S.</P>
<P>Lastly, The finding of the <HI>Poles</HI> of the <HI>Azimuth Circles</HI> is the same with the <HI>Hour-Circles.</HI> So if you would find the <HI>Pole</HI> of the <HI>Azimuth Circle</HI> Z G N, lay a Ruler upon Z and G, it will cut the <HI>Meridian</HI> Circle in <HI>g;</HI> then set 90 degr. of your Chord from <HI>g</HI> to <HI>d,</HI> so a Ruler laid from Z to <HI>d</HI> will cut the <HI>Horizon</HI> H A O in the Point ☉, which Point ☉ is the <HI>Pole</HI> of the <HI>Azimuth Circle</HI> Z G N. And thus have you found the <HI>Poles</HI> of one of the <HI>Hour</HI> and one of the <HI>Azimuth</HI> Circles. And by the same manner of Work you may find the <HI>Poles</HI> of all the rest. As</P>

<P>In this Triangle you have given (1.) the Side ☉ B, the Sun's Declination 20 d. (2.) the Angle ☉ A B, the Complement of the Latitude 38 d. 30 m. and the right Angle at B.

<PB N="99" REF="57"/> into Time (by allowing 15 deg. for one Hour, and one Degree for 4 minutes of Time) is 1 Hour and 49 min. and so much doth the Sun rise or set before or after the hour of Six, ac∣cording to the time or season of the Year: for if the Sun hath <HI>North Declination,</HI> then he <HI>riseth before Six,</HI> and <HI>sets after;</HI> but if the Sun have <HI>South Declination,</HI> then doth he <HI>rise after,</HI> and <HI>set before</HI> Six.</P>

<PB N="104" REF="60"/> <HI>and</HI> Semidiurnall Arches, <HI>of the most eminent Fixed Stars in the Heavens, exactly calculated for the Year of our Lord</HI> 1670; <HI>and also other Tables of the Sun's</HI> right Ascension <HI>for every Degree of the</HI> Ecliptick <HI>and Day of the Year: by help of which Tables, the Hour of the Night, the Rising, Setting, and the time of their coming to the South, may be obtained by the Rules and Directions prescribed in the forementioned Treatise, which will contain (besides the Tables here mentioned) all such others as at any time the Sea-man shall have occasion for in his Practice, and divers other things too tedious here to enumerate. But in the mean time I shall request the Reader to be satisfied with these two Tables following: These Exercises being things onely Practicall.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To resolve this Probleme by the Projection.</HEAD>
<P>That which is most intricate and difficult to perform by Numbers, is by Projection effected with the same ease as any of the rest. As in this Proposition, it is the Angle E Z P which is required.—Lay a Ruler upon the Zenith-point Z, and to the Point G, upon the Horizon; the Ruler thus laid will cut the Meridian Circle in the Point <HI>g.</HI> So the di∣stance <HI>g</HI> O, being taken in your Compasses and measured up∣on your Line of Chords, will be found to contain 146 degr. which is the Sun's Azimuth from O, the North part of the Me∣ridian.—But if you measure the distance between the <HI>g</HI> and H, it will contain 34 degr. which is the Azimuth from H, the South part of the Meridian.—And if you measure the distance <HI>g</HI> N upon your Chord-Line, you shall find that to contain 56 degr. and so much is the Sun's Azimuth from A, the East and West Points of the Horizon.</P>
<P><HI>This Example of finding the Azimuth was taken when the Sun had</HI> 20 <HI>degr. of South Declination. I will now farther exemplifie this Proposition by finding the Azimuth when the Sun hath North Declination.—As let the Latitude be as before</HI> 51 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>min. the Sun's Altitude</HI> 12 <HI>degr. and the Declination</HI> 20 <HI>d. North.</HI></P>
<P>To work this by the Canon of Sines differeth nothing from the former, for the Analogie or Proportion is general in all Cases.</P>
<P>Upon the Projection it is resolved (though the same way, yet) upon another Triangle, namely, the Triangle Z P <HI>a,</HI> in which is given (1.) Z P, the Complement of the Latitude 38 d. 30 min. (2.) Z <HI>a,</HI> the Complement of the Altitude 78 degr. (3.) the Complement of the Sun's Declination North 70 degr. and you are to find the Angle P Z <HI>a,</HI> the Sun's Azimuth from the North.</P>

<P>Of the Two first, the one is called <HI>Plain Sai∣ling,</HI> or, <HI>Sailing</HI> by the <HI>Plain Sea-Chart.</HI></P>
<P>The other is called <HI>Mercator</HI>'s <HI>Sailing,</HI> or, <HI>Sailing</HI> by <HI>Merca∣tor</HI>'s <HI>Chart.</HI></P>
<P>These two <HI>Charts</HI> are both of them composed of <HI>Right Lines,</HI> yet differ both in their <HI>Construction</HI> and <HI>Use,</HI> though not so much in their <HI>Use</HI> as in their <HI>making</HI> or <HI>composition.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Plain Sea-Chart</HI> consisteth of <HI>Meridians</HI> and <HI>Parallels,</HI> which are drawn in all parts equal from the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> towards either of the <HI>Poles;</HI> which is erroneous, as hereafter shall be dis∣covered.</P>

<P>The way of Sailing by the <HI>Plain Sea-Chart</HI> is much in use, nay too much, considering the <HI>Errours</HI> that it leads <HI>Sea-men</HI> into; though they are not so easily discovered in <HI>short</HI> as in <HI>long Voi∣ages,</HI> nor in <HI>places near</HI> the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> as those <HI>nearer</HI> the <HI>Poles.</HI> But, I suppose, it is more used, for the ease there is in <HI>Projecting</HI> of this <HI>Chart,</HI> more then in that of <HI>Mercator</HI>'s: other∣wise I know not why that should be so as it is embraced, and the other (I mean that of <HI>Mercator</HI>'s) so much neglected; which comes so near to the <HI>Spherical</HI> way of <HI>Sailing,</HI> that there is an insensible difference between them.

<DIV4 TYPE="sea chart design">
<HEAD>The Making of the <HI>Plain Sea-Chart.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Sea-Chart</HI> may be made either <HI>general,</HI> or <HI>particular.</HI> A <HI>General Sea-Chart</HI> is that whose Degrees of <HI>Latitude</HI> pro∣ceed from the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> to either <HI>Pole,</HI> which in the <HI>com∣mon Sea-Chart</HI> may be done; but it will be egregiously false, as the Degrees of <HI>Latitude</HI> grow nearer the <HI>Pole,</HI> as I have al∣ready declared.—A <HI>Particular Sea-Chart</HI> is such a one as is made properly for one particular <HI>Navigation:</HI> as if your
<PB N="159" REF="90"/> whole <HI>Navigation</HI> were not to exceed the <HI>Latitudes</HI> of 48 and 60 degr. of <HI>Latitude,</HI> and not to differ in <HI>Longitude</HI> above 8 degrees.</P>
<P>Now to <HI>project</HI> or <HI>make</HI> such a <HI>Chart;</HI> First, draw a right Line A B, representing the <HI>Meridian,</HI> and cross it at right Angles in the Point A with another right Line A D, representing the <HI>Parallel</HI> of your least <HI>Latitude,</HI> namely, of 48 degr.— Secondly, consider what Distance you will have your <HI>Parallels of Longitude</HI> and <HI>Latitude</HI> to be, (for in this <HI>Chart</HI> they are both equal,) whether an Inch, 2, 3, or 4 Inches, (for the lar∣ger the better.) But in this Example I have made them one∣ly half an Inch. I take therefore half an Inch out of an exact <HI>Scale,</HI> and run it up upon the <HI>Meridian Line</HI> A B, from A to 49, from 49 to 50, from 50 to 51, &amp;c. till I come to my greatest <HI>Latitude,</HI> which is here supposed to be 60 degr.—Thirdly, run the same Distance of half an Inch from A towards D, upon the Line A D, eight times, because the Difference of <HI>Longitude</HI> in your whole <HI>Navigation</HI> will not exceed 8 degrees.— Fourthly, draw the Line C D, parallel to A B, and B C, par∣allel to A D, and run the same Distances upon the Line B C as are upon the Line A D, and the same upon C D as are upon the Line A B.—Fifthly, from each Degree of <HI>Latitude</HI> in the Line A B draw to the like Degree of <HI>Latitude</HI> in the Line C D a right Line, as 49, 49; 50, 50; 51, 51; 52, 52; &amp;c. till you have drawn all your <HI>Parallels</HI> of <HI>Latitude.</HI>—Sixthly, for your <HI>Meridians,</HI> they are to be drawn in like manner as were the <HI>Parallels</HI> of <HI>Latitude,</HI> all of them equidistant, and par∣allel to your first <HI>Meridian</HI> A B, as the Lines 1, 1; 2, 2; 3, 3; &amp;c. And by this means have you the <HI>Meridians</HI> and <HI>Parallels</HI> drawn.</P>
<P>The <HI>grand Divisions,</HI> or <HI>whole Degrees,</HI> being thus set upon your <HI>Chart,</HI> we now come to sub-divide them. And for the dividing of the Degrees of the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> at the top and bottom of your <HI>Chart,</HI> let each of them be divided into 5 or 10 parts, and each of those parts sub-divided into 5 or 10
<PB N="160" REF="91"/> more less parts, according as Quantity will permit; for eve∣ry one of them is supposed to be divided into 100 or 1000 parts.</P>
<P>For the dividing of the <HI>Degrees of Latitude;</HI> they may be di∣vided as those of <HI>Longitude</HI> were, into 100 parts. But some∣times each Degree is subdivided into 60 <HI>Minutes,</HI> or <HI>English Miles,</HI> or into 20 <HI>Leagues.</HI>—Now I have divided the <HI>Degrees of Latitude</HI> in this <HI>Chart</HI> each of them into 5 parts, by which means it is capable of the <HI>Numeration</HI> either by <HI>Miles, Leagues, Centesms,</HI> or 100 parts.—For if you count by 60 <HI>minutes,</HI> or <HI>miles,</HI> then every of those Divisions will be 12 <HI>minutes,</HI> or <HI>miles;</HI> if by 20 <HI>Leagues,</HI> then every Division will contain 4 <HI>Leagues;</HI> and if by <HI>Centesms</HI> or 100 parts, then every of them is 20 <HI>Centesms.</HI> And thus much concerning the <HI>Making</HI> or <HI>Projecting</HI> of this <HI>Chart.</HI> I now come to shew</P>

Lay a Ruler to 5 ½ degr. both at the top and bottom of the Chord, and where the Ruler crosseth the Parallel of 50 degr. as at F, there is your other Place upon the Chart. So E and F lie in 50 degr. of Latitude, and differ in Longitude 5 ½ degr.</P>
<P>But if the two Places to be set upon the Chart differ onely in Latitude, and lie under the same Meridian as G F, then the Course leading from the one to the other is directly North or South, and the Difference of Latitude of F and G is 2 degr. G lying in the Latitude of 48 degr. and F in the Latitude of 50 degr.</P>
<P>But if the Places to be set upon the Chart differ both in Longitude and Latitude, as A and F, then the Course lea∣ding from the one to the other is upon some other Point of the Compass, so far distant from the Meridian as is the quanti∣ty of the Angle E A F, which here is 70 degr. 1 min. that is upon the E. N. E. Point 2 degr. 31 min. Easterly.</P>
<P>This Angle may be found either by Protraction by your Line of Chords, or it may be protracted by your <HI>Protracting
<PB N="162" REF="92"/> Quadrant,</HI> which in all these Operations upon the Chart is best, for that it avoids the drawing of Arches of Circles upon your Chart or Blank.

<P>Now from this Line A B, being thus unequally divided, you may divide the Meridian-line of a Sea-Chart according to <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Projection of any bigness, so that the Distance be∣tween Degree and Degree in the Aequinoctial be less then the Distance A D, which is here two Inches. And if a Chart were made that the Aequinoctial Degrees were two Inches di∣stant, and it passed upon a smooth Board, many Nauticall Con∣clusions might be wrought upon it very exactly. Being thus far prepared, I will now shew you how, from the Line A B,</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="solution">
<HEAD>To divide the Meridian Line of a Sea-Chart.</HEAD>
<P>A Sea-Chart, according to this Projection, may be made either General, or Particular. I call that a General Sea-Chart, whose Line E H, in the following Figure, represents the Aequinoctial, as the Line E H there doth the Parallel of 49 degr. and so I will make the Chart following to contain all Latitudes between 49 degr. and 57 degr. whose Difference of Longitude exceedeth not 8 degr.</P>
<P>Now to project such a Chart, having drawn the Line E F for the Meridian, and crossed it at right Angles with another Line representing the Parallel of 49 d. parallel thereto draw another Line F G, representing the Parallel of 57 degr. and another Meridian G H, parallel to F E. So shall you have made the Parallelogram E F G H.</P>
<P>This done, consider how far distant you would have your Degrees of Longitude upon the Aequinoctial each from other, as suppose (and as in this Chart I have made them to be) half an Inch. Take half an Inch out of a Line of Inches, and run that Distance along the Line E H from E to 1, from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, &amp;c. And also doe the like upon the Line F G, at the top of the Chart, drawing the Lines 1, 1; 2, 2; 3, 3; &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now for the Dividing of the Meridians E F and H G, re∣pair to the foregoing Figure, taking in your Compasses the Distance that is between Degree and Degree of the Aequino∣ctial,
<PB REF="101"/>
<PB REF="102"/>
<PB N="177" REF="102"/>which in our Example is half an Inch. With this Di∣stance, set one foot of the Compasses in the Point D, and with the other describe the Arch <HI>m m;</HI> by the very Edge whereof draw the Line A G: so is your Figure prepared to divide the Meridian-line of a Sea-Chart whose Degrees of Longitude are half an Inch distant.</P>
<P>Now in respect that your first Parallel of Latitude E H in your Chart is drawn for 49 degr. your next Parallel must be 50 degr. Wherefore set one foot of your Compasses upon 50 degr. in the Line A B, and with the other take the nearest Distance to the Line A G: that is done by turning the Com∣passes about till the moveable foot do onely touch the Line A G; which when it so doth, that Distance at which your Com∣passes then are, being set upon the Meridian of your Chart, will reach from 49 degr. to 50, which being set upon your Chart, on both sides thereof, from 49 draw the Line 50. 50 will give you the Parallel of 50 d. of Latitude. In like man∣ner for the Parallel of 51 degr. Set one foot of the Compasses in 51 degr. upon the Line A B of the former Figure, and with the other take the least Distance to the Line A G: this Distance set upon the Meridian of your Sea-Chart, on both sides thereof, will reach from 50 to 51; and there draw the Parallel 51, 51.—Likewise for the Parallel of 52 degr. Set one foot of the Compasses in 52 degr. in the Line A B, taking the nearest Distance to the Line A G: that Distance set upon the Meridian of your Sea-Chart, on both sides thereof, will reach from 51 to 52; and there draw the Parallel of 52, 52. Doe thus with all the Degrees, as 53, 54, 55, 56, and 57. So shall the Meridians of your Chart E F and H G be divided into whole Degrees.</P>
<P>For the Sub-divisions of these Degrees, they may be divi∣ded each of them into equal parts, as the Divisions at the top and bottome of the Chart ought to be; but the Degrees of the Meridian, as they grow higher, they ought still to grow greater. But the Difference is so small, that it cannot produce
<PB N="178" REF="103"/> any considerable Errour, though the Sub-divisions be all made equal between Degree and Degree. You may therefore di∣vide them either into 60 Minutes or English Miles, or into 20 Leagues, or into 100 parts of Degrees, as you shall best like of.</P>
<P><HI>But if you would make a Chart that the Distance between De∣gree and Degree upon the Aequinoctial should be an Inch, or any other Distance less then A D in the foregoing Figure; take that Di∣stance (as suppose an Inch) in your Compasses, and setting one foot in D, with the other describe the Arch</HI> o o, <HI>and draw the Line A H onely to touch the Arch</HI> o o. <HI>The least Distance taken from each Degree to this Line A H shall give you the Distance of the Degrees upon the Meridian of a Sea-Chart, whose Distance of Degrees up∣on the Aequinoctial are an Inch from each other.</HI></P>

<P>Then to find the proper Distance upon the Rhumb; Take the Line A P in your Compasses, and measure it upon the Me∣ridian-line, so that one foot may be above the greater Latitude so much as the other is below the lesser; and you will find the Compass-points to rest in E and S, E being one whole Degree below the lesser Latitude, and S one Degree above the grea∣ter.

So shall the Point T be the Place that the Ship was in when the Wind altered. So a Paral∣lel drawn through T upon the Chart will cut the Meridian at V in 51 d. and in that Latitude the Ship was. Now to find in what Longitude she was; Take in your Compasses the Line T V, and measure it at the bottom of the Chart, you shall find it will reach from E to 2 d. 21 m. And in that Longitude the Ship then was.</P>
<P>This done, upon the Point T (where the Wind changed, and drove the Ship 2 Points more Eastwardly, namely, upon the E. by N. Point) protract an Angle of 22 d. 30 m. namely, the An∣gle P T X, which is the Rhumb upon which the Ship sailed 50 Leagues after the Wind changed. Therefore take 50 Leagues out of the Meridian-line, and set them from T to X. So shall X be the Place that the Ship was in after she had sailed 50 Leagues upon the E. by N. Point; which, by drawing a Parallel through K, will be found in the Latitude of 51 d. 30 m. and by drawing of a Meridian through K also, it will be found to be in the Lon∣gitude of 6 degr. 16 min.</P>
