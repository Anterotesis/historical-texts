<P>Wee, being informed that these abuses are still continued to the indangering of that Plan∣tation, and that the like abuses are also practised in other Forreigne Plantations: Out of Our Princely care for the prosperity of these Colonies, which being well gouerned may be of great vse to this Nation, for the reformation and preuention of these and the like enor∣mities for the future.</P>

<P>And to the end that the Royal Grant of Our late Father to the President and Counsell of <HI>New England</HI> aforesayd, may bee maintained and vpholden, and that the Planters there, and aduenturers thither, may bee encouraged by all good wayes and meanes to proceede in their worthy designes, haue thought it fit, and doe hereby straitly charge and command, That none of Our Subiects whatsoeuer (who are not Aduenturers, Inhabiters, or Plan∣ters, authorised by Our President and Counsell for <HI>New England,</HI> according to the sayd Let∣ters Patents) doe presume from hencefoorth to frequent those Coasts to Trade or Traf∣fique at all with the Natiue people of those Countreys, or to intermeddle with the Woods, or Grounds of any of the Planters, or English Inhabitants there, otherwise then by the Licence of the sayd President and Counsell, or for the necessary vse of their Fishing on those Coasts, in which case of Fishing, or vnder colour thereof, they are not to vse any Trade or Traffique there, nor to challenge any Right to the Soyle there, or the Woods growing or beeing thereon, and especially Wee doe charge and command, that neither any Interlo∣pers, Fisher-men, or Mariners, or any other of Our Subiects whatsoeuer, being of the said Company of <HI>New England</HI> or otherwise, doe at any time hereafter dare to Sell, Barter, or any wayes to deliuer or conuey vnto any of the Saluages or Natiues of <HI>America,</HI> where any of Our English Colonies are or shall bee planted, any Weapons or Habiliments of Warre of any kinde whatsoeuer, or to teach them or any of them the vse of Gunnes, or how to make or amend them, or any thing belonging to them, vpon paine of Our high indignation, and the Confiscation, Penalties and Forfeitures expressed in the said Royall Graunt of Our sayd Father, wherein Wee shall proceede against those who haue offended, or shall offend in any of the premisses, in such manner and measure as the qualitie of their Offences shall deserue. And yet further Wee leaue it to the discretion of the said President &amp; Counsell for <HI>New England,</HI> and to other the Gouernours and Counsell in any other Forreigne English Colonie in their seuerall places respectiuely, to proceede against the Offenders in any the kindes aforesaid, ac∣cording to the powers already granted vnto them, and according to Our Lawes in that behalfe.</P>
